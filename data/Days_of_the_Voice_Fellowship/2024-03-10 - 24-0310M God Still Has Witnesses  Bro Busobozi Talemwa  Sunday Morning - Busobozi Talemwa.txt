Whatever Jesus is there is noise hallelujah amen amen praise the Lord so we just have a few greetings and a few uh things to say before we go to the word morning first of all brother Dan has a friend that he invited here sister Sharon Jia from if you canise up your hand ah right over behind here bless you're welcome you're welcome sister joia amen so this morning I want to bring you greetings from the Believers uh located uh close to a country calleda in a city called aat I understand they say they will be streaming with us this morning so I bring you their greetings amen uh they've not yet we've not yet started a church there but uh by by God's grace we intend that there will be a fellowship if God makes it happen what I know God always makes it happen I remember some years ago we would um minister to the Saints in in Adis Ababa via at that time we did not we did not have zoom I think we using [Music] Skype before the church started there and so well you look back many years ago now you see that so I believe the Saints in ad God will open a channel for them amen and also receive greetings from Sister Dina in Boston she has many times asked me to greet the church but I always forget so this time I had it on my mind I said I'll greet you she's one of us here but she just traveled there for our season she attends Fellowship here she supports the work here we do appreciate her uh but also there's a local Fellowship where she attends where were're able to direct her and so I also have a little testimony here we were this week at a hospital where we had gone to see is Sister Stella here I had I I'm used to seeing you this side so God bless you so we went to see her sister's children and uh and uh you know I'm so amazed sister and her sister have the same attribute they always love sending the message to other people and so your sister connected us to uh some patients who are in the [Music] hospital and we really preached the message there for several hours want to say something yes ah okay okay praise the Lord there is a lady we prayed for she had just come out of the operation and the sister was telling me that she's now better she even can walk but I tell you what that lady and her mother and her family they going to come to the message a little prophecy I gave right there and then some other two people told me they had say the same thing to this [Music] sister that has them in mind amen and also this morning I received a fresh testimony from Buddha Christian Fellowship Fellowship Pastor Jess called me this morning with a wonderful wonderful news uh we've had brother brother Sam give a testimony of God's grace in his we are so thankful for those good results and so we were also invited to go to Buddha to pray for the um candidates at that time they had a very good and anointed service and so the testimony this morning is that they performed they all passed all pass they passed like they have never passed [Music] the told told me that the first got 20 in and he said that this is the first time even the whole performance of all the others was very spectacular and so reading works studying hard works works sure about that amen and um uh then I just wanted to let you know uh I've I've been hearing a lot of questions of course these children being our children and getting married usually I believe thatth really marriage is on the shoulders of the parents as well as the uh the couple getting married that we are in total agreement with the parents of sister favor and the biological parents of brother sham and we are all in agreement because you see they've given us a short time and we we cannot be able to you know do it the way brother Andrew did it uh if we say that they're going to be doing meetings meetings for five weeks I don't know how much they can raise them and if you give an open invitation everybody is going to come and it's going to be upon your head responsibility to to take care of all of them so an idea came up and I supported it uh and I think every other young person that would want to go that direction I feel that will be a big relief so that weddings are not very complicated thing you know you invite 100 people and you get 400 people and you know you cannot be able to buy food for all of them and then you get headache I believe it should be something very simple for our young people and we should all be understanding so that we can be supportive of them to get married and start families support the work of God and really that's what I believe in so if you want to have a wedding with five people 10 people that's all right just the family and the friends that's still right what they kind of kind of had an idea that they should um uh not overden the people to pull money from them and then you get offended so and so so everybody's welcome to support their wedding with as much as you can of course you know all the wedding needs uh but for the [Music] reception is going to be an exclusive [Music] reception no it's going to be exclusive no that is very dangerous what you say very dangerous oh retion I don't know if that's the right luga word exclusive means that not every body is going to be invited but those who are willing and able to support with a sum of 55,000 the friends of sh and MERS you know it doesn't matter how many there will be even if you well as long as you can pledge to support that amount you be given an invitation card only those with invitation cards will be welcome there to be at a hotel so don't embarrass yourself but by coming without an invitation C because the the hotel will have instructions um so well I know that at dvf here we don't have issues with money and suppor I do not think that we will have problems with any person here I can't afford that well it's all right you don't have to go as simple as that and it's in a good spirit not in a bad SP and I encourage every young people who want to do do it that way you are welcome because then it relieves the burden for for the young people maybe to just look at other needs make their family members to support them on other things and them if they have saved up some money to help on other things and then for them they will just focus on that and you then can support them someone said called me said well I do not I I cannot eat 55,000 in a hotel that's the wrong understanding you are doing it to support their wedding it's not you feeding yourself you can even contribute that and not even e so do we all understand that so I think there will be uh I think you're already doing some uh you're already doing how do they call it yeah yeah they're already working on that I just thought I should clarify that for everybody their I'm also their parent I need it to be understood so we shall have a team leaders meeting after the service last week we didn't meet so let us meet this week and talk a little bit but I would like to appreciate the whole church for your generous contrib we are getting somewhere and like I I keep saying this go is attainable we are going to buy our we are going to buy it is attainable it's attainable and maybe like what I'm going to speak to the team leaders I want to speak to all of you tell you this we can do it but we cannot do it alone we need support from other people and each of you represents five or 10 or because you see in your sphere of influence and you have friends you have family in your team ensure that uh you encourage your team by inviting five more people to support you you know like brother SE if you contribute you as you you can afford 25,000 we in a week but if you bring five more people that's going to be 100 and it is possible for you to bring the how do you bring them calling them T by informing them the fundraising going on at church does that does does that everybody does that then you'll be surprised this winning group the one that they called a giant the way they because I'm a part of it I know the way we are able to do it we are inviting others to support [Music] us it upon themselves to inv others to support the cause and that's how we able to raise that much money stand on our feet this morning so that we can change theorder service and go to the word we just sing one song If you [Music] will okay this is from brother shami saying that I should glorify on the reception brothera kind of did you say that we have finished registration no the registration is not finished it is ongoing and uh if you would like to be a part of the wedding you can inform them they will add you in the group and they will register you okay I think that is now a good interpretation amen yeah so church wedding is invited for all every service for everybody amen uh can we sing that song Holiness Holiness is what I long for do you know it amen Holiness is what I need Holiness is what you want from me faithfulness faithfulness is what I long for faithfulness is what I need I don't know which key but we can try F I don't know if that's the key amen for just a few moment moments let us just sing this song relaxed a bit and uh we think about the words we are going to sing

[Music] bless we also going to read out of Revelation 1 [Music] verse4 up to vers 6 Revelation 1 verse 4 to verse 6 John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from all from our sins in his own blood and has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him be glory and Dominion forever and ever amen fore I'd like us to you to pray for me while I pray just ask that the Lord will use me I'm just a mortal ask him to speak to you this morning Lord Jesus I'm standing on the pull pit here with and we are mortors Lord we do not have something within ourselves that can bless these people but Lord when you come and you inspire our words and our thoughts then it will mean everything Lord we are helpless without you we do not have anything but a gift then we understand that a gift is a man taking himself out of the way and then you come and use him use my lips Lord use my mind my thoughts and let this day whatever will be spoken will will come from the Throne of God brothers and sisters here and those streaming the service I know they have spiritual needs and physical needs some needs they don't even know that they have but may you speak to each one I grant it Lord in Jesus name amen amen so this morning I'm speaking to you on the subject uh God still has Witnesses please stand your neighbor and tell them God still has Witnesses God still has witness so now after here the Bible Jesus rather spoke to them and he said and ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you now these are people that had had Jesus teach with him some of them had even done some Miracles at the beting of Jesus imagine but they did not have power the power to be a witness you see so now that power only comes when you receive the Holy Ghost you see these disciples were in the Church of Jesus and Jesus was their pastor but they did not have the Holy Spirit they had received right teaching they had been in the right atmosphere they had believed the right stuff they not have the power to be a witness and the power to be a witness comes by the Holy Spirit after the Holy Ghost has come upon you you are no longer the same you are now Witnesses of his resurrection and even today it is the same thing there is no woman or man has a right to say they are witnesses of the resurrection of Christ you do not have a right to say that if you are not yet filled with the Holy Ghost what you are maybe you are a Believer but you are not a witness for you to become a witness you must be filled with the Holy Spirit now in the Book of Luke chapter 24 let us take a little look at Jesus after the resurrection verse 46 he said unto them thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem remember that Jesus is now speaking these words to the people he had told for three years and a half some of these people had walked close to him they had eaten with him they had moved with him they had had him teach so they knew the doctrine of Jesus and also they had apparently repented of their sins and now you know Jesus now died and rose again and now he meets with them and he tells them that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in the name of Jesus because that's how it was written it will be preached in my name un among all nations beginning at Jerusalem and now it appears as if he was telling them to go and preach he was telling because there had been Witnesses because right here on verse 48 he says and ye are witnesses of these things had seen Jesus healed they had seen him cast out demons they had walked with him they had followed him and they had believed him with all some of them like Peter said I will never for but we know they went ahead and for because when they arrested Jesus they did not have staying power the power to stay and be a witness is only from the Holy Ghost if you canot get filled with the Holy what you have is intellectual faith if you do not have faith from the heart you don't have the power to be a witness what you have in you will be fear you don't have the the ability to stand before some and the confidence about what you believe and maybe some of you are like that this morning the reason is you do not have the Holy Ghost yet you know when Peter Peter was with Jesus he said others will leave you but I will never for be with you until the end even when you are dying I'll be with others can go but I will not go you know you feel like he was a man who was bold he was a man who had Faith but that was intellectual faith because when Jesus was faced with his adversary Peter came with a sword he was he meant what he said and here now he came with a sword and he cut off the ear of the man who had come to arrest Jesus and he was you see I told you I will defend you I'll fight for you and many of us Believers are like that we take things kindly we take things intellectually we Le on wisdom rather than Faith but you cannot have you cannot be a true witness you cannot have faith if you do not have the Holy Spirit in your soul you must come to a place where you open up before God where you wait at the fills you with the power of the Holy Ghost that does not happen it is only a matter of time but you will forsake Jesus because you have no power to be a witness I'm here to speak to you this morning if you don't want it there are many all over the world and even some here who are witnesses of what I'm talking about God still as witness and you know when Peter was F with adversity and then they C Jesus and he saw with his eyes them taking Jesus away and he follow to see what they would do and what how Jesus would respond when it reached a moment he felt like no I can't take this I can't die and a little girl came and told him I saw you with that man said what are you talking about I don't know what you're talking about I even never seen the man in my life this is the man who said I'll be with you until the end but he had not power friends we need power we need power tell your neighbor we need power amen power comes when you are filled with the Holy Ghost and Jesus sent them he said You shall be Witnesses repentance and remission of sins shall be preached in my name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem tell them you are witnesses you saw me heal you saw me deliver you s you saw me set free the captives you saw me doing the Miracles so you will go and do the same you shall be Witnesses but he said wait before you go and behold I send you the promise of my father upon you come on help me and preach with me this morning I sent the promise of my father upon you he in the city of Jerusalem wait there wait in Jerusalem you go wait Jesus did not have confidence in them to be Witnesses until they were endued with power until he says until you be endued with power from are you hearing me this morning until you endued with power he has no confidence in you until you were endued with power you have no right to call yourself a witness until you ended with power you have no right to stand as a Believer a chrisan because you cannot be a witness you have just heard but you don't know what you're talking about it's just like those son Sons of ke who came and they were casting out demons and they say we cast you out in the name of Jesus who Paul speaks about they were just you know bring it in third person they were not they were not Witnesses and those demons listen to them and they knew the words they spoke were right but the people that spoke them were not Witnesses so you may have a right mental Faith you may even know what to believe you may even know the message from back to from from from You Know cover to cover you may have read all the Bible that does not make you a believer that does not make you a witness to be a believer you need to be a witness when they bring a witness in court it is not someone who says I heard it is someone who said I saw I witnessed you know one time you know there was the son of King David called ABS the son of King David absum you know went uh to form a revolt against his father and you know what happened that little boy as he was taking the people and they were fight there was a fight and joab the captain of David was sent by King David to go and represent him on the batt and make sure he doesn't kill his boy and so there was a a commotion and you know well absum was on on a donkey on ass and you know as he ran you know the donkey or the ass just took him straight to the branch of the tree and you know he his head was just there and you know he couldn't come out until he was killed right there there was a little man and and this man was called um what was his name Kush there was a little young man called Kush Kush heard everything Kush saw everything and he was amazed and because joab saw that kush was a witness he came to K and told him go to the king and tell him the tidings tell him what you have seen and while Kush was going to start off there came another man and his name was arimus arimas had not seen anything arimas had had the commotion he had everything that happened but he does not know for sure what exactly happened he came quickly to he said because I feel it all over me let me go and tell the king the Glad Tidings and then he said but it's not your time to go what are you going to say anyway you've not seen anything just allow me to go and then he said all right you can go he owed him to go but he actually was not a witness and there are many preachers who are preaching today but they are not Witnesses they don't know what they're talking about they even this Sunday morning many churches all over the world there are many preachers who are like arim they don't know what they are talking about they are not Witnesses of what we're talking about they are not Witnesses of his resurrection but they are preaching because they're excited because they can do some Miracles here you hear them prophesy Papa they think that you know preaching the gospel is comedy preaching the gospel is not a show preaching the gospel is not a TV show preing The Gospel is amen Bringing Down the word of God witness speaking of something you know speaking of something that is revealed to you speaking of something you have seen speaking of something you've heard and you are sure about what you're talking about and and when you know he he he didn't even while while was running on the right path on the right path oh may God send us more Cush may God send us more cushies and I'm here to tell you this morning God has sent us a cushy in this prophet of Malachi amen a true Messenger a true witness the resurrection of Jesus Christ he came with the word that was pointing us to Christ he heard he saw he knows what he's talking about Hallelujah am and he let the people through the path he took the message through the path but there are many others who are like Aras what didas do he didn't use the path he used a shortcut he ran through the shortcut and his running was like wind he ran so fast the Bible says that he overtook cush and he went ahead of him and he reached the king but before he reached the king you know as he was running the one that keep the the watch over over the tower they saw him running said who Could That Be who Could That Be and someone said I think that is arimus because the running is like the running of there are many people Oh Glory to God in this Christianity who are running like Aras they are running like Aras they taking a shortcut and why did he say they running like that of we have a word inanda which means cross legs when someone has that kind of legs crossed legs they can't walk straight they just just go like there are many Christians who are walking like that and your life is crossed your leg is crossed you are never straight we don't know your leg is confusing us your feet is confusing us are you a Believer or you are not are you a Believer or you are not are you going to heaven or you are not are you worldly or you are you are so full of let me tell you bre you should not be like be like have a message be a witness of what God has done for us in this hour this message is more than a church this is more than a church this is more than a denomination this is more than a doctr we are beyond that this is beyond religion oh my we are Beyond a religion we have arrived up higher we are getting ready for the resurrection this is beyond religion we need to understand that we don't need to come religiously we don't need to believe this message religious we witnesses that Jesus Christ has Reen again and our lives CH anded before the King live forever you are great you arey him wait tell me I'm not interested in all this G I want to know what do you have for me is my son alive or de wait I'm telling you is my son alive or dead forever the only thing I know I heard a lot of noise shut up there needs to be a generation let me go ahead of myself the Bible says we are Kings and we are priest there need to be a generation King tell some of shut up shut up you don't know what you're talking about shut up I want to hear one messenger who has the truth who is a true witness I want to hear only the TR you shut up you have nothing to tell me Oh Glory to God re the message we have we are true Witnesses we know what we are talking about hallelujah amen and when came the other guy was go in the corner sh just shut up be there and while he was there then came another one arrived and when he noticed when he arrived he wasn't guessing he wasn't just emotional he had a message and his message was straight to what he witnessed said long leave the king I'm sent by the to let you know that there was a re and Son ABS is dead and the King immediately when he had that because of that message he broke down let me tell you a true message will be his message will be straight to the Bible his message will be straight to Christ not to the denomination or the carry on it will be straight to the world and you know what it will do it will bring people to that moment of repentance that moment of tears that moment of Brokenness of realizing amen something has happened that has changed my life forever and we have received that message from our true witness in our generation the enti message is not a fa the enti message is is a message from a witness of the word of Jesus Christ you know what when he came he went straight away to the word he told us women should not be pastors amen he told us that amen men cannot be a pastor canot even be a Deon if they married more than once I mean if they polygamist be husband one wife where did he take that right from here he was a true witness he told us that baptism is not in a trinity because a trinity is a doctrine of devil but the god of the Bible is one God it is in the book of Isaiah God one Lord and he told us God is a spirit and that Spirit God came down and was born in human flesh John 1 ver4 he put on flesh and he D among us and we beheld his glory and he told us Jesus is not a second person he not a third person he's the god of the Bible that was witness he told us denominationalism will bring the mark of the beast and message was come out of her my people come out of my people don't be partakers of their sin what is it we have received a true witness do you know what that makes us that makes us through Witness hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I said hallelujah hallelujah that makes us true Witnesses of Jesus Christ and he told them you cannot go wait in Jerusalem the problem that we have many people don't tell they have no confidence in God they don't trust him they don't believe he will fulfill his promise but when he told the disciples the disciples trusted him they waited for 10 days they knew everything but they waited brother wait upon God because one thing I know about God God is faithful God is faithful no one can ever accuse God unfaithfulness when he gives a promise he keeps it he keeps it he fulfills it and if you trust him if you have confidence in him he will come through for you but the problem with trust in chariots We Trust in our abilities there was a man who said some trust in chariots others trust in this but I we trust in the god I will trust in the name of my God trusting Our God we not trusting our abilities in the Chariots what man has we trusting God oh it is so sweet to trust in Jesus it is so sweet because when you trust him you are confident that is going to come through for you when you have faith in him you will be called a fool when you have faith in him you be called unrealistic you be called anible the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God do you believe he will give you the holy ghost or you do not if you believe then learn to wait on him go somewhere pray until he F the come to churching and expecting will fill it is his promise and when you receive the holy ghost from that time on you are a witness the had witnessed what had happened but for them to be two witnesses they to receive the power of the Holy Ghost you need to receive the power of the Holy Ghost friend when you receive it will shake you up so much that sometimes you can even speak in Tong so much that you will forget about your mind you will lose your mind they would say you brainwashed oh if that is brainwashing I need more brainwashing I need more brainwash from the power of the Holy Ghost amen he will sanctify you he will sanctify your mind sanify your soul sany your body amen amen that the glory will go back to and then you he will make you a man a real man if you have never received the Holy Ghost you are not a real man you're not a real woman but that moment when filled with power the Bible says you be ued with how do you receive the Holy Ghost you pray you ask him to fill with theh after burning all the breaches after breaking all the hind after laying your pride and everything they come to him Lord it doesn't matter what they told me it doesn't what they call me it doesn't matter what the word say me I am here fill me with the power and you know what the Bible says he came like a Russian and when he came he filled hallelujah amen and while they were there he came as a leak of fire came one by one oh God send your power in the same way he can do it again in the same yesterday today and forever we Are Witnesses I was not always like this but I tell you what I am preaching this because I am a witness hallelujah amen one time I was dead in my Anglican Church I not left from right when he filled my heart he made me where I am today when he fills your heart change you from a liar he will change you from a drunk he will change you from an immortal you and give you a power to be a witness hallelujah hallelujah in the Book of John 15 verse 26 but when the comforter is come whom I will send unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth which proceeds from the father he shall testify of me and he also shall bear witness because ye have been with me from the beginning the disciples were called by Jesus they were separated taught and guided by him they saw and had Jesus teach and they believed they saw and had Jesus cast a demon and they themselves cast a demon in his name some of them could even cast them in his name think about it but they were not yet witnessed you can be in church for two years 3 years when you are not a witness and you will deny Jesus at your earliest opportunity did you know you as a Christian who is a witness you are a representative of the whole Chris whatever you do whatever you say you are representing the whole Church of Christ on Earth but why I believe is not able to do it because they not Witnesses we have too many church members we have very few Christians why do we have a lot of corruption even here in our country until you have a lot of young people wanting to go and join politics not because they have a heart to Ser people because they have a heart to go and steal money because they know for sure that's where the money is and they right and these are Christians the president talked to Robert you know Pastor Robert Kay and a few other pastors and he told them give me some of your good people I want to put them in in in in some institutions where I don't want corruption to put them in in tax you know revenue auth and put but what happened they brought the whole thing down quicker than even the infidels so they are Christians by name they Nom Christians they are not Witnesses but brother sisters when one time you get filled with the Holy Ghost you will realize these things of the world nothing you will have a new dream you will have a new ambition to seek after the Eternal things I don't know about you but I am seeking after my eternal Heritage I am on my way to heaven I don't care about the things of the world if God gives me that's all right if God makes me Rich that's all right and he has the ability to do that here is what I want to tell you my heart is where my treasure is and my treasures are in heaven my treasures are above when the power of the Holy Ghost comes in your heart you receive the honest the down payment of what is up there the Holy Ghost is not our go the Holy Ghost is the Hest of our goal our goal is to go be with Jesus but when you receive the Holy Ghost you have the power exercise everything everything that those who are in the Kingdom can do you have the the power to live a Christian Life you cannot live holy hear me now you cannot live holy if you don't have the Holy you must receive the holy in order to live holy if you think you are living holy and you don't have the Holy Ghost that is your own works and God says it is nothing before me is filthy rug but when you filled with the is his life in it is a life that no man can flow but until they receive the baptis of the Holy Ghost these people they were not your true Witnesses oh God make us Witnesses in the message Witnesses 53 and God help us to see the day that when men will be just what they are you know I say this now with all respect it isn't our city full of bootleg joints just hurting are you hearing what I say because we have too many uh you know uh some of these bootle joints or bars Orting stations or you know immoral you know BRS and things that is not what is hurting us because the world is full of sinners Liars fornicators adter murderers thieves that is not what is killing us here is what is hurting us more than ever is people who are professing to be Christians and not living like it that's the thing they are not a correct Witness they're not they can't witness until they have an experience and when they have an experience then they can become a witness automatically they become because they are born again and all of the things of the world all things have passed away and all Things become new then you become a witness unto Jesus when you receive the Holy Ghost all things are passed away tell your neighbor all things are pass away all things are passed away oh glory to God all things are passed away your desires pass away your cigarettes you throw them away you only need to ask where is the scripture just smell so bad for you because the world enjoys it that's the appetite but when you receive the Holy Ghost you receive a new appetite let me tell you when you receive the Holy Ghost you become drunk because the Holy Ghost intoxicates the ho ghost comes through you he comes in you he comes all over you the Holy Ghost takes over your mind takes over your heart takes over your soul takes over every part of until you forget who you are you forget who you are and the Bible brings it in one one phrase that says all things pass away behold all things are new they used to know you as a liar and they can't believe you now but he simply tell them just watch me I'm a new man now you go back to your friends and tell them sorry I cannot walk with you anymore why I no longer who you used to know I'm a new man now they would say no we still love you you say all right I will hang around and as long as you hang around you will infate them you will you will you will you will give them because what are doing what you used to do you are no longer doing they used to take is a social drink and you used to say it's all right remember I'm a Christian I can't take more than one it's all right and they will give you drink but brother when you f the Holy Ghost you'll be with them all right and then they will tell you as usual you tell them I'm sorry so what is happening I'm no longer what I used to be so you are a fool I'm a fool for Christ and then they will say you have lost your mind say I found my mind and they will say you are brainwashed and they will tell them if that's brainwashing I need more of they cannot keep up with you I'm saying they cannot keep up with you if the world is tagging around you there is a problem with your experience I am telling you I know what I'm talking about if the world loves you because you a kind man a kind woman but if oh my God you are the one who had sweet in their test but the moment you receive the power of the Holy Ghost let me tell you you are change and you become what we call reder they don't want to test you anymore because your taste is different your heart is drawn on things about your heart is looking about it's looking down here oh God give us more [Music] witnesses Jesus knew before these Apostles could ever go out and be correct witness they had to experience what they were witnessing about wouldn't that be nice today if every Seminary did the same thing if every Christian did the same thing would just come to church and say now I'm accepting Jesus as my personal savior I am going to stay right here till I get the baptism of the Holy Spirit then I'm going to go out and be a witness but what happens you accept Christ as youri and you put a full stop to it that's just the beginning you water baptism is just the beginning you need to go all the way you need to seek the holy you need to thirst for the God cannot give you something you do not want yeah you say I want it but I don't have you do not want it you are a liar because if you want it you will come for it it's like I have this phone and you want this phone but you don't want to ask me it is because you're proud you don't want to ask and so I won't give it to you but when you come to me and say can you please give me that phone I sure it's been yours for a year but I waited for you to ask and this is how God is he doesn't give you the Holy Ghost because you're proud how many have ever gone to a fasting and prayer because you want to go to with the Holy Ghost and let me tell you if you did not get the Holy Ghost it is because you did it the wrong way you come but you've not burnt your Bridges I'm going to pray and if it doesn't work out I still go back because after all he has not fulfilled but oh be like that man was in a field him when it came to him he KN down he said God if you don't F me with the Holy they will find my bones that man was filled that have you really made up your mind or you a liar oh you hypocrite don't you worry leave your sins for the blood to cover just leave it for the blood toover when you come before him be ready and willing burn your Bridges repent your sins leave your past about what you have done no matter how your life has been that is now the old you when you come to him don't you worry he will he will power in new wine and when he Powers new you you will become drunk with a new wine hallelujah hallelujah you've you've seen drunkards who don't even know how to speak English the moment they drink a little you find them talking in English what is you what is you what is your problem go away from there because they are intoxicated when you receive the Holy Ghost you will speak new languages new t t you even have what is happening Hallelujah you are drunk you are drunk your behavior will change am I preaching to someone it is not difficult it is easy that last will die the Holy Ghost amen will take you and control your flesh your flesh will still remain the desire there the will colonize you amen I wish I had a voice to shout the of the Holy Ghost will put you under control and whenever your flesh is out the Holy Ghost will tell him no go back down go back down because this one is a holy ghost F child of God sin will not have control over you why because you are filled with power you are ended with power if you need him say Amen you are endued with power the power I'm talking about is real is real it is more than emotional is more than emotion but when he comes you can feel him bubbling in your soul you can feel bubbling in your heart you can feel the joy you can feel the joy unspeakable and full of Glory there was a brother who came in the youth meetings from Ken and right there he received a burden of God fing him in the power of thehost and he couldn't rest he spoke to brother k with and him for a while with him he told him continue seeking until you're F the brother tried it times praying and then he gives up he waits he firsts and then he gives up but this time he he was focused s me a long email I don't have time to read it for you but he said when I went back to my country I was determined I was focused to be filled with the Holy Ghost because I desire un hung if you love somebody you do not go away until they come you wait for them you don't go away until they show up because you want them the young man went he told to his Pastor his Pastor said that's right keep seeking keepie keep asking and he went to church a few days fasting and praying and listening to the message reading the Bible waiting upon God and I'm telling you what he sent me an email filled with joy filled with excitement he said on the last day when I was about to give up you asked my brother one of the brothers to pray with me and then he encouraged me he told me keep on pra I I was fasting for a few days I didn't have energy but when that power came I was filled with like a giant like a giant I was so full of joy from within he said this it was so strange and yet so sweet [Applause] strange so sweet I love the feeling said every time from that moment when I begin praying I pray endlessly I pray endlessly I feel like I want to pray one second but then I feel ped I feel ped what is it the power of the when Jesus was right there on the mountain he prayed endlessly why he had the life of God when you have that life of God in you amen you will be a man of woman of prayer you can be a witness too nothing can stop you now I'm accepting Jesus as my personal I'm going to stay right there until I get the baptism the Holy Ghost and then I'm going out to be a witness things would be different don't you think so we wouldn't have that loose cuted testimonies people testify and say they are Christian and they go out and live other lives and the unbeliever comes in and sees that and he says look at them is that the way and the devil will always Point them out you can't just depend on that Devil is a buiness and don't underestimate his ability and his business room because he know knows what it's all about people walk in here they don't know what you're talking about but they've heard this is the truth preparing our for the RT and then because they know the devil knows those are not changed and so he will look at them if you're saying that this is the truth how come it did not change how come it did not change how come some say like this and you can't debate with the devil on that he knows his a business he been in for a lot of a long time now before you can be a witness as I've said you have to know something you really have to be a witness you have to know what you're talking about how many want to be witness now if you want to be a witness don't let it end on a Sunday morning after this Sunday morning you are not yet filled with the Holy Ghost him until you do something extraordinary do something you've never done before is fasting fast no longer fast even no longer thir after thir after him forget about your food for a while go in a closet somewhere pray don't pray until you're tired when you tired wait until something happen remember the moment you're about to give up that is the moment is about to come don't accept the devil to discourage you if we have young people filled with the Holy Ghost I tell you we shall change our world we will change our country we will change our continent we will change our cities because the Holy Ghost is contagious as much as the the filthy Spirits are contagious you walk close around to somebody who has a f the spirit and then it begins to come in you because you yourself are not filled but if you filled with the holy spirit let me tell you whatever you walk those demons will scream a man a woman filled with the ho is a thunder to the devil because the devil does not know what to do with you wherever you go demons are screaming you are not seeing them literally feeling them spiritually whenever you go those demons begin to scream those demons begin to scream how will you know because those people will not like you without a reason they will begin to hit you that is how Jesus was wherever he went they did not like him and one time he went around the toms of GAD and when he arrived there he was still far the demon Spirits they knew him and they began screaming have you come to take us before our time and the man was feared amen because if you have the Holy Ghost demons will Hallelujah why do you think that people will someone will come and tell you let's go to the movie theater because they know the spirit in them is the spirit in yous know each other know each other but if you're filled with the Holy Ghost brother this is the second time you're going out I will tell the to AR if you filled with the Holy Ghost you cannot someone cannot come and you're f with the Holy Ghost the moment someone tells you that go to your PR go to because it means the deviled yes they never found you out I remember when I was living still living in Pastor Le's house I was not yet a believer of the message but I was Anglican and there was a little girl living in Pastor's house little older than me at that time about two three years and so there was another boy on the village who was not a Believer and me I'm not a Believer but I'm living

Christ find many people who can't understand why we are so happy have cross over Jordan two can and this is what the matter with me and I said this is like heaven to me this is like heaven to me the

him be glory andion forever and ever amen amen and I want before I finish to go through a little bit of this I want to tell you what has made us he has made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize is one of them forgive me I'm just excited right he [Music] has do you understand it say it on your lips two times say he has made he has made all right now change it say he has made me he has made me say it again he has made me say it two more times he has made day he has made I'm F day Hallelujah W yes sir glory amen he has made me I didn't make myself but I am he has made me amen what I'm trying to say it is not youra slap your neighbor tell them it's not your he has made you you did not save yourself salvation is his doing feel free to shout you understand what I'm talking about salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed me for a purpose he B me for a purpose I am a king spiritual King oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne oh let me listen to me there is a throne that Jesus is going to sit on one day and that is called The Throne of David remember he promised David an everlasting Kingdom a kingdom without that's why they were asking Jesus when he was on Earth is it the time for the kingdom to be restored you are our King that is why the Jews laid for him Palms that he walks over because they thought he had come to restore the kingdom of David and they asked him are you a king he said you have said so and then he said so you mean you're going to and he told him hallelu amen because listen at that time please open your understanding now at that time Jesus was not a son of David he was a son of man a prophet a good man and as God that time the office was in his kingdom was not of this world it was of heaven so he answered my king is not of this one but there was a confusion they also know there was a man supposed to come on the to continue the of and he was he looked like him but he didn't fulfill it that's why the Jews never believed him but they failed to understand listen they fa to understand that was just a dispensation of the same who will also fulfill the other are you following me he was also supposed to be son of DAV and Son of God so son of man started from when he started his ministry up to when he died son of man Min it was a prophet a man dying for our sin godh son of man Min Son of God was he was fulfilling son of but there was another Ministry of the same person Son of God that one started where on the day of P when he the spirit of Truth Shall he will remind everything you will be endued with power what is the power oh I feel like speaking what was the power it was the power of the Son of God Son of God ministry as the Holy Spirit and it has been going on from that time until the Rapture and when the Rapture goes and finishes there's going to be another cut open of the same Jesus now the son of he will have a throne and he will sit he will rule the world with a ro of iron the Bible says so for a period 1,000 years [Music] years he will rule the world the King of Kings the Lord of lords and his kingdom will be a righteous Kingdom there will be no sin that kingdom is not in heaven the Bible says he will come back again to the Earth with tens and tens of thousands of his Saints who will they be ask your neighbor who are those who are those if you have received
