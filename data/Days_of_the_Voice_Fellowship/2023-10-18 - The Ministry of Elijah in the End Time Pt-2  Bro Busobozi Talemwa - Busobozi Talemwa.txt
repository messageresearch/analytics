========================================

what I spoke on on [Music] Sunday and I'm also ministering to the Saints uh in evening light uh bright Tabernacle evening late tacle so uh for their service this evening on Zoom so I'll greet them in a moment praise the Lord are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen David said I was happy when they said to me let's go to the house of the Lord amen so tonight we are reading once again from from Malachi 4: [Music] 5 and then we will read other scriptures later on behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord amen amen you may be seated so I send our greetings uh to evening by Tabernacle brother asked me to speak to the Saints here on Zoom so the saints that are streaming this on Zoom I send you our regards in the name of Jesus Christ so we are speaking on the ministry of Elijah in the end [Music] time um there is a lot uh to speak on this subject So within one hour you can imagine that uh I would just be hinting on a few things here and there sometimes I have uh quotes to read and then I end up not reading them but uh we just ask that the holy spirit will lead us tonight we have received an Elijah Ministry in our time and this ministry has turned our hearts back to the Faith of Our Fathers and um but you notice that Elijah did not just or will is not just coming in the end time the ministry of Elijah has really been there even before our time the ministry of Elijah has been in the in the Old [Music] Testament and it was prophesied to come again in the end time the prophecy which I read here in the Book of Malachi chapter 4 is just a a prophecy after the ministry of Elijah has existed [Music] twice because the first Ministry of Elijah is seen in the man himself Elijah and that was we will be able to look at it briefly today in the book of First Kings 18 shortly we shall read there but we also see that when Elijah left his ministry continued in another man called elishah the anointing that was on the ministry of Elijah or the anointing which was upon Elijah came back in a double portion upon Elisha and Elijah's Ministry if you read your Bible you will find it has many similarities with the ministry of Elijah because the ministry of Elisha was the continuation of the ministry of Elijah so now after Elisha after Elijah and after Elisha now God through another Prophet Malachi he gives a prophecy he says behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the [Music] Lord so in other words that the the ministry of Elijah is in continuity here now you have to understand that the man Elijah was one and he did not die he went to heaven alive and and you know but his Spirit oh let me put it this way the spirit of God which was working upon Him continued working now if you see if you you study prophets you can study Daniel you can study Isaiah you can study you know Ezekiel and many other prophets you will notice that their Ministry was a bit varing for example the ministry of uh of Moses was that kind that would turn water into blood you know it was sent to force pharaoh to let the people go but you see the ministry of Elijah is different and by the way in all the Old Testament the ministry of Elijah was very special from all the other prophets if you find you know go God loved or wanted to use the ministry [Music] again and he he uses it for a work of restoration so I want us to look at First Kings 18 and we will begin from verse 19 praise the Lord now the there are quite very many verses but uh we will try and and see how much we can read for you now therefore send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount camel and the prophets of Bal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount camel we are reading from verse 19 chapter 18 came unto please and Elijah came unto all the people and said how long hold ye between two opinions if the Lord be God follow him but if Bal then follow him and the people answered him not a word then said Elijah unto the people I even I only remain a prophet of the Lord but B's prophets are 450 men [Music] let them there forgive us to blocks and let them choose one block for themselves and cut in pieces and lay it on wood and put no fire under and I will dress the other bulock and lay it on wood and put no fire under and call ye on the name of your gods and I will call on the name of the Lord and the God thatth by fire let him be God and all the people answered and said it is well spoken and Elijah said unto the prophets of Bal choose you uh one block for yourselves and dress it first for ye are for ye are many and call on the name of your Gods put no fire under and they took the bulock which was given them and they dressed it and called on the name of Bal from morning even until noon saying oh Bal hear us but there was no voice nor any that s answered and they leaped upon the altar which was made and it came to pass at noon that Elijah mocked them and said cry aloud for he's a God either he's talking or he's pursuing or he's in a journey or per Adventure he sleepeth and and must be awake [Music] for and they cried aloud and cut themselves after their manner with knives and Lancet till the blood gashed out upon them and it came to pass when the when the when midday was passed and they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that there was neither voice nor any to answer nor any that regarded [Music] praise the name of the Lord now Saints I want you to uh uh to to follow me closely here sometimes you think that these things we've gone through it many times and you know you already know them but I I know that the word of God is always new and and I want you to follow me closely so that you can be able to understand you see this sounds like a very good story but this is more than a story if I was to take time I would almost preach to you on every verse for a [Music] while but you know it has a deeper meaning I want you to see the time that God sent Elijah to Israel you know this was a time when Israel had backen Elijah came at the time when Israel was backen and the glory of God had departed from Israel so King Ahab married from the among the heathens and in shortly we are going to look at that more a little more but now you know Jezebel started fighting against Ahab rather started fighting against Elijah and maybe I'm thinking for a little more Foundation I should give you a little more scriptures here for you to look at uh I've not finished the reading in uh First Kings 18 but if I don't go back please you could note it down and then read it later so the whole thing begins with ahab's marriage and I want you to look at it in chapter 16 verse [Music] 31 and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of ethal King of the zidonians and went and served B and worshiped [Music] him you know let me tell you there is something that God cherishes and that is his word and the word of God does not change season after season man changes but the word of God does not [Music] change if you walk in the word of God you are going to reap the blessings of the world but if you don't walk in the word there is also a curse so you see whenever you open the word whenever you open the Bible it has two things it has a blessing and it has has a cur it has a blessing if you walk in it it has a cur if you don't walk in it and you know we can know that by seeing the church the the church natural Israel is the church natural and we've seen that Israel God dealt with Israel as a as a nation as a group God deals with with uh with the Gentiles as individuals so everything that happens to Israel as a church as a nation it happens to us Gentiles as individuals so while I look at Israel as a nation I want you to examine your own personal life as an individual so now everything begins with Ahab before sends Elijah things begin with Ahab you know the Bible says Ahab you know he had seen it as a light thing as a simple thing to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of [Music] of but now before we look at jeroboam I want you to look at but before you look atam I want you to look at Solomon and before we look at Solomon I want you to look at David the whole thing begins there David the Bible says he was a man after God's Own Heart whatever God said David said amen I believe it David worked in the will of godid did what God desired yes David was not a perfect man just like every individual even you who is listening to me today you are not a perfect man some people think that for you to be a believer you need to be a perfect man or woman no otherwise we will not be Believers why are we Believers we are believers in order to become perfect the word which we believe must perfect us it must bring us to full Perfection and that's why we are believers but David being a Son of God being a child of God working according to the statutes of God God loved him and God promised him an everlasting Kingdom he said you know you know he will continue reigning his Lage and so David was blessed before the Lord but then later on he had a son and his name was called Solomon now Solomon was also a good man we know that Solomon actually built the temple you know God told David well you know I love you but you have too much blood on your hands I not allow you to build a temple said but I I will have your sun building because God was looking at that as continuity of David's Kingdom the convenant he had made with David continued on through Solomon let me tell you church when God makes a covenant with you it continues on through your Lage it continues on down to your children children that is why as Believers you always have to claim am every blessing every promise of God that he has promised you it must come down to your Lage amen oh fathers how many fathers do we have here all you fathers all you fathers on Zoom today amen all of you hearing me if you fathers here is a word for you if you have children claim every one of them and you put them under the token none of them can be lost if you believe that with all your heart amen because the promise of God said is unto you and your children and their children that's the promise of God well that that happens also among the Gentiles if it happened to the to to the Jews and so then Solomon built a temple but you see along the way Solomon married he married not a wife but wives he married more wives more wives and he had a lot of women and here is the thing most of these women he married them because of political alliances and uh he thought that he will it will help him to be a strong King if God has called you he has anointed you to be what you are you do not need to go into any alliance with anybody you can accomplish the purpose of God for your life without any Alliance and many times these alliances they bring us trouble with God praise the name of the Lord and so we notice here that then Solomon when he grew old these women they they started to you know bring him closer to the to their gods and he started building altars the same man who built the altar of the Lord he now began to build the altars of these other gods and God was not happy with Solomon and because of that you know he came down when Solomon was about to die he comes down to to to one of the prophets and he told him I'd like you to go and prophesy not to the son of the of the king but to one of the Servants of the king prophesy to him and say praise God that God is going to to reap the kingdom into two and he's going to give you 10 tribes and the other one will remain with the two and he will he will remain in in Jerusalem because of my servant David the city of God could not be taken away from from the from the Lage of David because of David not because of Solomon the way you serve God can end up blessing your children there are certain things you are fighting am I preaching to someone here today there are certain things you are fighting in your life listen listen those things that you are fighting if you don't overcome them it will be passed down to your children but if you fight them and overcome them that will be the end of them that will be the end of it so let me tell you as Believers we ought to fight a good fight of faith and refuse anything that is bad to go down Our Generation so that you would tell yourself I know myself I'm going to fight with this demon I'm going to fight with this spirit I will not allow it to cross it must die with me yes but the problem here Solomon received and reaped the blessings of his father [Music] but he was not able to keep them he went and served other God and when that happened God was not happy with him he said now I'm going to take the kingdom and I will give the biggest part to the servant of Solomon so that he can rule as he wishes God is God that's what desires listen so now um if you can go with me to the book of First Kings chapter 11 let us see this prophecy quickly now vers 29 and it came to pass at that time when jeroboam went out to Jerusalem that the prophet aijah the shilonite found him in the way and he had CED himself with a new garment and they too were alone in the field and a c the new garment that was on him and he rent it in 12 uh pieces and he said to jeroboam take the 10 that were uh the pieces for thus say the Lord for God the god of Israel behold I I I will re the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and I will give you 10 tribes but he but he shall have one tribe for my servant David's sake and for Jerusalem's sake the city which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel because that they have forsaken me and I have worshiped and have woried asth and uh the goddess of the zidonians Kos the god of the moabites and milcom the god of the children of Ammon and have not walked in my ways to do that which is in right in my eyes and to keep my statutes and my judgments as did David his father how bit I will not take the whole Kingdom out of his hand and I will make him Prince all the days of his life for David my servant's sake whom I I chose because he kept my Commandments and my statutes but I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand and I will give it unto thee even 10 tribes and unto his son will I give one tribe that David my servant may have a light uh all way before me in Jerusalem the city which I have chosen to me to put my name there I will take thee and thou shal Reign AC according to all that thy soul desireth and shalt be king over Israel and it shall be if thou Willl hecken unto listen listen to this part now and it shall be verse 38 and it shall be if thou Willl hecken unto all that I command thee and will walk in my ways and do that which is right in my sight to keep my statutes and my Commandments as David my servant did that I will be with you and build the a sure house as I build for David and I will give Israel unto you oh my God praise God I want you to hear this this is a powerful promise you know God was let me tell you if there is something that God loves is someone who will stay with the word someone who who who has the ability to stand with the word in the face of anything in the face of every Temptation you stay with the word God loves such a person God loves such a man imagine he gave a promise to David and he said David I've given you an everlasting Kingdom I've even given Jerusalem it's a holy city but you see because because of Solomon Solomon carries the the legacy of his father but because he went to other gods God was not happy with him he now sent Prophet aijah to go and prophesy to a servant called jeroboam jeroboam was only a servant someone who did not even have any claim on on royalty someone who never dreamed of being a king someone who never thought would ever be anything that is the same way God blesses the Gentiles when you never thought you would be anything God gives you an Everlasting Covenant yes we have a big promise here it can be accomplished it will be accomplished it cannot fail but there is a condition God gives a condition to he says yes you know he had a new garment so this Prophet comes and he tears this garment imagine a prophet coming down and he he begins taking your new suit and cutting it into 12 some of you can box him what are you doing but God works in ways we don't know but as long as it is God praise God say because people shout and dance and they feel offended the holy spirit is not emotional but the holy spirit is emotional whenever he moves on somebody he does things in an emotional way that's why our Prophet said anything without emotion is dead so you find this prophet he was moved by the Holy Ghost and he goes down to this man jeroboam and he takes his clothes and he begins tearing it tearing it into 12 pieces and he gives him 10 pieces and he tells him sayth the Lord God has divided the Kingdom of Israel and he has given you 10 10 tribes 10 of them they are yours this man must have gone crazy at that hallelujah what has happened yes God has given you 10 and here is what really touched my heart he told him you see but for for Solomon One Tribe will be given him and he will remain with a City Jerusalem because that one was chosen it was a chosen city of God and because of David my servant it will remain his lineage I want to say this God does not remember does not forget God always remembers every promise he makes when he made a promise to David he did not forget it has God given you any promise I want to say he cannot forget he cannot forget the promises Hallelujah Hallelujah that he has met to his beloved and so he says but now to the son of Solomon I'll give One Tribe to him because uh I have because of David my servant so God remembers the son of Solomon not because of Solomon but because of David God will remember your children is children because of you if the Lord Jesus studies the decisions you make the stand you make God will remember your children his children because of you because of your stand because of your good decision God will remember the generations after you oh that's a powerful prophecy praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and he says and it shall be and then he says here and I will take you job and you will re according to all that your soul desires and you will be king over Israel when you are given a promise God gives you Liberty the Bible says where the spirit of God is there is Liberty hallelujah amen when God gives us all the Redemptive promises in the Le it's up to you to enjoy them the way you want it's up to you to go from glory to glory it's up to you to buy more cloes to buy more cars to build more houses it is up to you the promise has already been given that you are going to take a line flowing with milk and honey so it's up to you to enjoy it to the fullest as long as you stay within the work you stay within the land that is the only thing that God requires of you stay within the world don't go out of the world stay within the world so he tells job God is giving you 10 10 tribes rule the way you desire according to the desire of your heart my goodness oh Hallelujah according to the desire of when God gives you a blessing you're not going to keep going back to him now do this with this no if he has given you a blessing it is yours your to enjoy the way you desire praise God Amen and now job and and God told him you will rule according to the desire of your heart and you will be king over Israel and it shall be if you will hecken unto all that I command you that is the requirement of God if you will hecken to all the word if you believe every word then I will walk in your in my and walk in my ways rather and do that which is right in my sight not what is right in your sight but what is right in God's sight and God's sight is the word of God hallelujah a Believer every day you desire to know what is the will of God what I'm doing what does the word say about it is God okay with it that this one is our guiding pillar this one is our road map the Bible is our road map the Bible guides us the Bible leads us if you do anything out of the word out of the message of our day even if it is right in your sight you are wrong that's why God has given us the word so he told J as long as you keep and work in my ways and you do that which is right in my sight and work in my ways do that which is right in my sight you keep my statutes and my Commandments as David my servant did that I will be with you that I will be with you Hallelujah we have a promise oh my when I read this I'm not reading this I'm reading about myself God said I'll be with you you ought to believe it for yourself as an individual he says I if you do this then I will be with you he didn't say if you will feel me but he said I will be with you if you walk in my ways if you keep my word I will be with you and about upon this I can now say like amen I will fear no evil for thou art with me regardless of the situation around me I know the Lord is with me regardless of my feeling the Lord is with me regardless of what the devil is doing around me the Lord is with me why because I'm right standing in the word if you are standing on the word then God is with you whether you feel it or not as long as you are standing on the W the promise of God is I will be with you amen and that's not enough he continues on and he tells jerob and I will build thee a sure house an everlasting Kingdom that's what it means as I build for David my [Music] good the way God gave a promise to David God was ready to give it toob if only could walk in the world only job could walk in the ways of God a sure house and I will give Israel to the mhm what a promise and I want to assure you this is the promise same promise we have God is promising you hallelujah hallelujah God is promising you like he promised David to build a sure house for you to walk with you Amen to be with you to give Israel to you what is Israel Israel means a prince with God that means god is promising you that you will be a royal priesthood that you be royalty God is promising you you will not be a common I I will make you Royal God is saying here I will make you Royal do you know what it means to be royal you cannot be a beggar if you are royal you cannot be sick if you are royal God is promising you victory over every other SE Israel was supposed to be above every Other Nation Israel was supposed to be above all other nations when they went to battle they were never defeated when they went to battle they overcame every battle why because they were Israel they had fought with God and they had prevailed and God is promising job even job without fighting God was ready to take jeroboam and plant him in the promise as long asob accept to stand with a word my good Lord brother sister is the same thing for us as long as we accept brother to walk in the work to walk in the word as long as you accept God is going to do for you like he did for Israel and this was the promise that God gave to jerob but did job keep it is a sad thing I tell you when he was given these words of Prophecy King Solomon knew about it and he he wanted to kill him no one can kill you you can't die before your attack if you have a prophecy of God over you M brother bam said there will be a bride in every nation and the Book of Revelation says there will be Overcomers in every generation that is a prophecy on my head I cannot die until I overcome I cannot perish until I overcome let me tell you if you a bride of Christ can't even allow you to die until you you overcome because he knows when if you die it should be gain for you because you will just wake up for the Rapture so in other words when we die it is not a loss so if a Believer dies thing before the Lord but I'm telling you if you're still fighting you cannot die God can't allow it because you have to overcome the batt hallelujah amen glory to God and see here now Solomon thought he kill but he could not touch was wise now there are some people who who who would be like well if I'm a seed God has prophesied to me by his word I have beli it even if I do what I want to do nothing can touch me job would have done the same she would have said want me I have a prop on me let me sit here let him send his solders see if I will die if if he did that a spear would have gone right through his heart but when heard of it he sneaked out and he ran to Egypt there is something about Egypt even Jesus ran to egyp even Moses there's quite something about and Israel is connected to Egypt is connected to Africa so Africa is a blessed country it's like a place of Refuge a place of [Music] preservation okay we talk now and topt and he himself and he was quiet the whole time King Solomon HED for him and he couldn't find even if you are SE don't go in a bar after all I'm an elect you will die you will perish don't go into bad things when you're know guard your heart stay in the right way stay in the right thing say the word and then you are sure you're safe that prop has to be accomplished the reason why God told you that you are who you are and you know who you are because he has given it to you as a way for you to keep yourself away from other [Music] things and so jeroboam kept himself in Egypt and now Solomon died when King Solomon died Hey listen to me church when King di that now the the King's son was you know now Gathering the people to be crowned as a king came back he said it is time for me to go and possess my prophecy my promise that came to me by prophecy you have to receive a revelation it is time those times of living and wallowing in in sin those times of living in the world over you have to have a revelation it is time it is time for me right now to go claim my place in the word of Prophecy hallelujah amen that's why we are here we have come to claim our position in the word of Prophecy which cannot fail so now he quickly politically to gather people with also the other people heed so they came and brought a proposition to the king they said ah live long King but we have a quest your father treated us this way very hard what about you are you going to reduce the the the treatment and make it better going to be wor went to do consultation so when he went for Cel he first of all went to the elders he said give me Cel what should I tell these young said yeah for you to be able to win their heart don't don't be very strict it on them relax things don't over tax them relax things don't be very strict on and then let me also go to my little buddies and ask them those ones we went we used to go out in the [Music] world you know to do this and that let me go and con you know when you're Consulting you should know who to consult from if you consult from everything and anybody you're going to be confused I preached you on one time on I cancel thee I'm not done with it I'll go back to I cancel the you see if you you're going to get the councel God has a councel for us in our generation he says I cancel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire gold tried in the fight what is that gold is the word of the hour that comes by Elijah in the end time we'll come to that later so now we see here he received the wrong counsel from the younger buddies they told him ah you squeeze them so he came and he told them now my father's my father's W it says my little finger will be bigger than my father's W meaning I'm going to be much more tougher because the the young man told him if you speak that way they would think you are strong and they will fear you so the moment he said that so it has an opportunity he gathered the people told let's go home yes go home so when they reach went back home follow them and they crowned him as a king of 10 tribes Hallelujah so the mistakes of Israel unbelief of Israel what happened God used it so that the Gentile church can come to light the Bible in Romans 11 it says they were blinded for our sake because they were blinded we can see until when until the fullness of the Gentiles be coming it will not come in until the last age comes and the last age we have the end time Elijah with an end time message to restore us back to every word of God oh my God and becomes only a king in Jerusalem as the prophet had and jeroboam became a prophet of 10 tribes oh now his Reign started he was so happy he was so happy but here is a mistake did God told him I will be with you like I was with David You Will Rule according to your heart will be king over Israel you will do everything that you like as long as you walk in my way you walk according to my word you walk you obey my Commandments but did he obey that's the question that's the question look at First Kings chapter 14 vers s we'll read just about four four verses from there God tell jeroboam th sayth the Lord God of Israel for as much as I exalted thee from among the people and made thee Prince Over My People Israel and rent the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to thee and yet thou Hast not been as my servant David who kept my Commandments and who followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in my eyes but has done evil evil you have done evil above all that is before thee for thou Hast gone and made the other gods and molten images to provoke me to anger and you have cast me behind your back therefore behold I will bring evil upon the house of jeroboam and I will cut off jeroboam him that pith against the wall and him that is shut up and and left in Israel and I will take away the remnant of the House of jeroboam as a man take away dang till it be all gone that dieth of jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat and him that dieth in the field shall the fouls of the air eat for the Lord has spoken it this is everything that comes to anybody that does not work in the world the promises of God are sure the ways of God are right and his reward is always on point but to those who walk according to his ways are you hearing me you see Saints even those of you who are on Zoom I want you to listen to this care you want to be blessed just like God had promised to bless but job sins could not help let him be blessed job went after other gods Mountain images he made and the Bible says he provoked God his anger because he cast God behind him let me tell you life and death are in your hands when God gives you his word his word is going to give you everything life yes but remember it is not only the promise of God it is also your way of Behaving around God's [Music] promise there is a part for us to play When God gives his promise his promise is sure it may tell that it will surely come to pass if you walk in his word is it easy no it is not a man who was promised a kingdom but he he he he he failed terribly you think because he didn't want to but in his understanding thank God for brother he preached a message Le not on your own understanding understanding was maybe telling him you have to marry these women so that you can keep the kingdom let me tell you we are not going to get the kingdom by alliances no you find even the churches they're doing what they call you know Federation of churches to come together so they can get money from the government and I heard someone saying even message Believers we should gather together so we can be powerful then we shall have a bishop over us the government shall give us money whenever they enthroning a bishop then they will give money and a car Believers of the message they also think that now but let me tell you we as a ENT message believers we don't need any alliances someone once asked me how do you how do you then you know look at how do you do order and how do you discipline those ones who are erant how do you do this without we have Aiven hierarchy that is according to the Bible a prophet said local Elder is the leader of the church is the highest Authority in the church local is the pastor is the highest order I was in Ethiopia we started the ministry there but I told the Believers I am just behind your pastor the highest Authority here but let me tell you also the church is not basing on the pastor the is just a servant who is also a prisoner to the word and the Holy Ghost so now as long as he gives the word and the Holy Ghost by the Holy Ghost then that is enough that's all we want to follow he thought he would make some alliances and because of that he followed after other gos and he put God behind his back he forgot who had put him in power he forgot who had lifted him up and because of that God cast the House of jerob God cast him God cast his children God cast his house God cast everything but if you walk in the ways of God God will bless you everything you have God help us that's why we are holding on to the world we are not ready to leave the world so help me God let us stand with the word no matter how the devil is pushing us we know we have a promise we have a promise a promise of victory hallelujah amen and the house of job was cast the sins of jerob caught up with him if you don't fight that demon if you don't overcome it none of these days it will catch up with you he had a very long Kingdom spoken to him by God but his dynasty did not continue because of worshiping other God God remembers everything and now after David after and comes King King came on the line because after after job it was always other kingdoms fighting and then another taking over another [Music] taking and later on IAB becomes a king and now the Bible says as I'm approaching to finish now I'll I'll continue with it later it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of job son I have knew what God wanted but even King took it lightly he took it lightly to go after other gos he took it lightly to go to the club he took it lightly to go to all this B of games believer taking sin lightly took it lightly to go to fornication took it lightly to go to smoke took L to go to have a social drink those are the things that made the house of job to be cast those are the things that made God to divorce the denominations and he said I'm going to call a bride out of these denominations she will obey my voice she will believe my word she will follow
