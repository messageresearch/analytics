[3:42] Christian choir, please.
[4:30] God bless you.
[4:33] We're going to sing a song that says
[4:36] over and over again.
[4:42] I stood on the bank of a wide raging
[4:47] river
[4:48] trusting that I get across.
[4:54] And I made my way through some valleyies
[4:58] and
[4:59] believing I'd never get lost.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; I stood at the foot of what feel like
[5:11] knowing I have the strength for the
[5:14] climb.
[5:17] Through every desert, each test,
[5:23] there's one thing that's sure every
[5:26] time.
[5:29] &gt;&gt; Over and over, again,
[5:34] God is faithful.
[5:39] Over and over again and again through it
[5:45] all.
[5:47] He's made me able
[5:51] to stand and survive.
[5:54] To come through a life
[5:58] which should look like I couldn't win.
[6:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus is with me.
[6:08] I claim the victory
[6:11] over and over again.
[6:17] &gt;&gt; If you ask me why, I have no hesitation.
[6:23] God does what he says he will do.
[6:29] And I simply say everybody
[6:34] has taught me there's nothing he won't
[6:38] help me through.
[6:42] So I shouldn't dwell on the hardships
[6:46] and struggles. When I looked down beyond
[6:50] them, I see
[6:54] where this will end this with great
[6:58] celebration.
[7:00] And deep in my heart I
[7:06] over and over, again,
[7:11] God is faithful.
[7:15] Over and over again
[7:20] through it all.
[7:22] He's made me a home to stand and survive
[7:30] to come through a life.
[7:38] Oh Jesus is with me. I could trees over
[7:46] and over again. Over
[7:51] and over, again,
[7:55] God is faithful.
[7:59] Over and over again and again through it
[8:05] all.
[8:07] He's made me able
[8:11] to stand and survive.
[8:14] To come through a life which look like I
[8:19] could wait.
[8:23] Jesus is with me. I claim the victory
[8:29] over and over again.
[8:34] &gt;&gt; Jesus is with me. So I claim the victory
[8:44] and over and over again.
[8:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:54] Blessed be his holy name.

[8:59] and over. The Lord is faithful.

[30:26] but before I do that, I have some quick
[30:28] business to do.
[30:32] If you notice, I try to stay away from
[30:33] all these preliminaries.
[30:37] I always try to stay away from it
[30:40] because we don't come for that. We come
[30:41] for so I always want to go for what I
[30:43] have come for
[30:46] but uh some things you know it's good to
[30:49] do it
[30:52] to recognize those who have come.
[30:56] If we leave out anybody, you forgive us.
[31:00] But I'm going to do it by district.

[38:48] &gt;&gt; I'm sure this the believers from Nepak
[38:50] stood up under something else, but
[38:52] you're all from Kamoja. So, God bless
[38:53] you.
[38:56] I I say people don't know their
[38:57] districts.
[38:59] This is very serious.
[39:02] Toronto.
[39:05] No one from Toronto.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Probably this safe town.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Well, we say God bless you all.
[39:13] And uh yeah,
[39:18] God bless you. Bless you.
[39:21] Thank you for coming.
[39:23] Okay. Maybe everybody's from Wakisan
[39:25] campaign
[39:31] the city boys and girls.
[39:34] God bless you all. Now let us clap hands
[39:37] for everyone.
[39:41] Amen. Amen.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; We appreciate each and every one of you.
[39:47] &gt;&gt; Okay, I'm having five more minutes here.
[39:51] Um,
[39:53] now before I invite a minister,
[39:56] &gt;&gt; brother Joel, can you please come right
[39:58] quick?
[40:03] I think um I will leave this other
[40:06] business uh uh for for the next service
[40:08] because I don't want to eat up much
[40:10] time.
[40:14] &gt;&gt; So, brother Joel, I'm inviting him
[40:16] because we skipped a very important part
[40:17] of our service.
[40:23] usually uh uh if you can step aside and
[40:26] wait for me. Uh usually on every Sunday
[40:30] morning
[40:32] in our church which was this Sunday
[40:35] morning which we skipped.
[40:38] I felt the atmosphere was just right for
[40:40] the world.
[40:42] We usually give announcements
[40:47] &gt;&gt; for what the gatherings of the people
[40:49] have been
[40:53] for our church land.
[40:56] And um because when we started the
[40:58] ministry about four four five years ago
[41:03] um you know the Lord laid it on my heart
[41:06] that we will not go to fellowship in a
[41:08] school.
[41:11] Not because the school is bad
[41:14] but because the school has a certain
[41:15] spirit.
[41:17] All who go to open church there
[41:22] usually they don't um you know buy land
[41:26] quickly.
[41:29] I think you will agree with me. So I
[41:31] said no I don't want to to to also be
[41:34] like this. And please, if your church is
[41:36] in a school,
[41:38] please I'm just speaking our vision. I'm
[41:41] not saying
[41:43] don't don't carry this over and cause
[41:45] problems at home.
[41:48] I I try to not cause trouble.
[41:51] And so, um, we we started in my house.
[41:55] You know, when we filled up the place,
[41:57] we got another little place
[41:59] around.
[42:01] We filled up the place, got a tent to
[42:04] fill it up.
[42:05] And now we you know we are renting in a
[42:08] a hotel
[42:11] in a hotel hall
[42:14] &gt;&gt; which is actually we can we had our
[42:17] first youth camp there
[42:20] can probably sit about 290 280 people
[42:24] and so we've been there now for three
[42:27] years now
[42:29] and but then God gave us this vision
[42:33] to start collecting fun.
[42:36] Most of our church member are young
[42:37] people.
[42:40] I don't know how many are inside
[42:42] cuz I know everybody's running around.
[42:45] Let me see if you're from DVF and you're
[42:47] here, please.
[42:57] They're all young people.
[43:00] &gt;&gt; Have you seen any elderly man?
[43:04] &gt;&gt; All of them are young people.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; But uh first of all, I want you to join
[43:08] us to clap for these people.
[43:12] &gt;&gt; As however much they are are young,
[43:16] they have supported the vision.
[43:19] So we started
[43:22] um I will just try to make the long
[43:24] story short.
[43:26] And so we decided, you know, to we were
[43:28] led to um collect funds,
[43:32] start a fundraiser
[43:34] to buy land. And uh land at the time
[43:38] when we started was about 150
[43:42] and that was big.
[43:45] that we reach somewhere in the middle
[43:49] and and uh we we realize we cannot buy
[43:52] land
[43:54] continues to increase
[43:57] and we continue to use the funds
[44:00] whenever we have youth camp
[44:02] the last youth camp I used about 30
[44:06] million
[44:08] because we we didn't have money so I had
[44:11] to run to land fund
[44:14] on the church
[44:15] and I spent it on the youth.
[44:18] That's how painful it is if you come and
[44:20] you don't pay
[44:24] fee.
[44:26] So someone will pay someone will take
[44:29] the blessing but why don't you support
[44:31] the cause.
[44:34] So um um so we you know we've u been
[44:37] doing it that way and it became very
[44:39] difficult and so I was in my office and
[44:44] I had even a headache
[44:46] how are we going to do this and go to
[44:48] the bank but they're going to give you a
[44:51] very high rate
[44:54] 21 18 the basis maybe 18 19%.
[44:59] They said we can't do this by the time
[45:01] we finish paying off the loan.
[45:04] we might as well buy another laptop.
[45:08] So then it was then that the Lord gave
[45:09] me this
[45:12] let's collect money
[45:14] weekly. God asked Moses, "What do you
[45:17] have?" He said, "A ro and God decided
[45:20] with that." So what do the people have?
[45:23] They may be young, but they have
[45:25] something. They don't have the big
[45:27] money, but they have something. We are
[45:30] not going to have a white man like our
[45:31] precious brother Joshua from Australia
[45:35] buy our land church land.
[45:38] All right. Because this is not his
[45:40] church. He also has a burden back home.
[45:44] we are going to do it ourselves.
[45:47] &gt;&gt; And and so and and so we um
[45:52] we made seven groups
[45:56] and uh these seven groups we made papers
[46:02] and through its
[46:04] psalm two. So everybody come and pick a
[46:08] whatever whichever you pick
[46:11] is your group.
[46:13] The groups were seven church age
[46:15] messengers.
[46:20] Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Um, who's
[46:22] the first such age messenger?
[46:25] Martin
[46:27] up to William Brham.
[46:29] &gt;&gt; So now we have all the people I me I am
[46:31] in Martin Luther.
[46:33] So that's what I picked and everybody
[46:35] who joins our church we have team
[46:38] leaders
[46:40] can you stand up here
[46:44] seven of them you see young people you
[46:48] see you see around I don't know 1 2 3 4
[46:51] 5 six where's number seven
[46:55] somewhere ah seven I didn't see you
[46:57] sister
[46:59] so these people now all right so
[47:19] But all the same
[47:21] uh money that comes out from
[47:31] that's what Brother Joel is going to do
[47:34] to our church.
[47:37] We need to do it today every Sunday.
[47:41] So I had to explain to you and after he
[47:44] says it gives it in two minutes then
[47:48] I'll tell you how far we have gone
[47:51] two minutes.
[47:53] God bless you all.
[47:55] I greet you all in the name of Jesus
[47:58] Christ and you're most welcome to this
[48:00] youth meeting.
[48:03] Uh thank you for supporting us.
[48:07] Uh pastor has already given the
[48:08] introduction.
[48:14] Uh I thank God for uh this vision that
[48:17] he gave to our pastor
[48:21] and we are all standing behind him
[48:25] to see that this is coming to pass
[48:28] and I believe if the Lord tries
[48:32] and next time you might come when we
[48:33] have our own sanctuary.
[49:19] 23
[49:23] for phase two.
[49:26] Paul contributed 130.
[49:31] May God bless you so much.
[49:34] Then Iranas
[49:36] &gt;&gt; contributed 50,000
[49:40] Martin
[49:41] 90,000
[49:46] 62,000
[49:49] Martin Luther
[49:51] 430,000.
[49:54] My God bless you so much.
[49:57] John Wasley 83,000.
[50:01] uh then William Branham William
[50:04] &gt;&gt; 164,000.
[50:07] So in in the total of the week
[50:12] we have 1 million
[50:14] 9,000.
[50:19] Uh so the the total we have the the cash
[50:22] now we have
[50:25] is 21 million
[50:28] 850
[50:32] My God bless you.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Which we actually don't have all that
[50:38] cash anymore because we've used some on
[50:40] this youth camp.
[50:45] But I wanted to say this
[50:47] currently
[50:49] there's a sister Susan. Where is sister
[50:51] Susan?
[50:54] She here.
[50:56] This sister Kim.
[50:59] God bless you.
[51:00] You know, we're in a church meeting
[51:04] and told them, "If anybody finds where
[51:05] land is, let us know."
[51:09] And she found the land. And she said,
[51:12] "In my neighborhood,
[51:14] we said land."
[51:16] And so we went and scouted it when we
[51:18] left
[51:20] just right on the road.
[51:23] And uh so we saw the land. Land was very
[51:26] expensive. Our target was 200 was 150
[51:30] million.
[51:32] The land was for 300 million.
[51:35] But that's double.
[51:38] But you see without with faith all
[51:39] things are possible.
[51:42] So I went and met the owner of the land
[51:45] with a few brothers who happens to be a
[51:48] Pentecostal Christian.
[51:51] We told him help us serve the Lord.
[51:54] help us serve our generation
[51:57] and give them the gospel and and so
[52:00] reduce the price. Long story short, we
[52:03] ended up at 220 million
[52:07] and uh and uh we told him look at that
[52:12] time we had about 60 million 60 70.
[52:17] I told him we going to give you 100
[52:18] million
[52:20] and the rest give us one year.
[52:23] He laughed. He said, "Do you think
[52:25] you're buying tomatoes?"
[52:28] Land you pay you pay 70%.
[52:31] And 30% you pay later,
[52:34] maximum three months.
[52:36] But our God is able. He never failed.
[52:39] This man finally he took the 100
[52:42] millions
[52:44] which the 30 millions we had to find
[52:46] quickly find it
[52:49] when he accepted
[52:51] and we paid it. We paid it to him and we
[52:55] have given him some more.
[52:57] We are remaining with 75 something
[52:59] million.
[53:01] &gt;&gt; So very soon actually we have the first
[53:05] land title
[53:09] and uh well you can rejoice with us.
[53:11] It's a it's a good thing you know. So,
[53:15] so
[53:19] probably before our speakers return
[53:21] home,
[53:23] I would take them there.
[53:26] Uh, Pastor Tasha is an architect. You
[53:29] did not know that.
[53:31] Probably you could even do a plan for
[53:33] us. Who knows?
[53:36] For free.
[53:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Well, well, well, well. But
[53:45] that's the father the Lord has brought
[53:46] us.
[53:48] And I know I've taken I've eaten up much
[53:50] time,
[53:52] but it's worth it. And brother Joshua,
[53:56] don't be nervous. You are at liberty.
[53:59] You don't have any time constraint.
[54:03] Just deliver whatever the Lord has given
[54:04] to you.
[54:06] And is that a man? We are here for camp.
[54:10] Oh, they might as well preach the whole
[54:12] night.
[54:14] Amen. Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you for allowing me to say
[54:17] those things.
[54:19] Can we now stand on
[54:23] Amen. Amen.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[54:38] &gt;&gt; There's a song I want to sing.
[54:44] and use our brother.
[54:47] You know, I told brother Michael
[54:50] and I keep calling you brother Michael
[54:54] uh you have to forgive me and I told
[54:57] brother Joshua
[54:59] that uh
[55:01] he has a burden for young people.
[55:05] But this is um a young man
[55:10] Just like I am
[55:13] always speak as a young man.
[55:17] When I say younger men,
[55:19] I don't mean spiritually.
[55:25] Don't misunderstand.
[55:27] I mean age- wise.
[55:30] But uh
[55:33] there is a generation shift.
[55:38] There's a changing of the baton.
[55:41] And brother Joshua, I believe with all
[55:43] my heart,
[55:45] he's one of those that God is going to
[55:47] use in Australia
[55:50] in this coming years in a mighty way if
[55:53] the Lord carries.
[55:55] And so he has an intense burden in his
[55:57] heart to preach the gospel.
[56:00] And I just pray that we open our hearts.
[56:03] I pray that the Lord will use him
[56:06] for our needs tonight.
[56:15] &gt;&gt; Sing along with me.
[56:18] Oh,
[56:25] all
[56:27] things are poor.
[56:42] Holy.
[56:49] Sing with all your heart.
[56:58] Hallelujah.
[57:01] All
[57:02] things
[57:04] are possible,
[57:10] holy.
[57:15] Sing it one more time as brother Joshua
[57:16] comes now.
[57:19] Holy.
[57:37] Oh,
[57:50] feeling.
[57:53] You may take your seats for a moment.
[57:57] Just want to say goodday
[58:00] like a proper Australian. We put good
[58:02] and day together and we say goodday.
[58:10] &gt;&gt; It might not translate well. But I want
[58:12] to say, are we happy?
[58:15] &gt;&gt; If we're not happy, we may as well go
[58:17] home.
[58:20] But I want to say because I won't say it
[58:23] at the end,
[58:24] &gt;&gt; but it's been a big highlight of my
[58:26] preaching life to be here.
[58:35] It uh hasn't been easy to come here, but
[58:37] it's been good to be here.
[58:43] We live in a country that is has a very
[58:46] high cost of living as brother Michael
[58:48] could tell you
[58:54] &gt;&gt; and I'm not one of the rich white men.
[58:59] I have a wife and three children and I'm
[59:01] the only one that works.
[59:07] So we're not one of the rich ones.
[59:11] But uh it's nice to be here
[59:15] &gt;&gt; and the reason I came
[59:18] because I have a burden for the next
[59:20] generation to come into what I have.
[59:29] And my prayer coming here was if I can
[59:31] say one thing that helps you, let me say
[59:34] that.
[59:41] I want to thank brother Michael for that
[59:43] masterpiece, that sermon this morning.
[59:45] Do we enjoy that?
[59:51] &gt;&gt; I want to preach like you.
[59:54] I want to preach like brother Michael
[59:55] when I grow up.
[1:00:01] He started preaching on the cross and
[1:00:03] again I thought somebody stop him.
[1:00:10] And I thought I'll be I'll be back in
[1:00:11] the maps trying to find something in the
[1:00:13] back of the Bible.
[1:00:18] But I want to just say this before we
[1:00:19] read a scripture
[1:00:24] that when I got married, I was 22 years
[1:00:26] old
[1:00:28] and my wife was 18.
[1:00:32] We had no money.
[1:00:35] We drove a beaten up old Corolla
[1:00:41] and my wife when we got married,
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; she got a job because I wasn't earning
[1:00:46] enough
[1:00:49] and she made more per hour than me.
[1:00:54] Could you imagine what that does to a
[1:00:56] man's pride?
[1:01:01] But I worked more hours,
[1:01:04] so I took more money home.
[1:01:07] That's how I got through.
[1:01:10] &gt;&gt; But the amazing thing when he was
[1:01:12] talking about tithes, and the reason I
[1:01:14] bring it up
[1:01:16] when we had just got married,
[1:01:19] I took a week off work
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; and I wasn't going to get paid for that
[1:01:23] week off work.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; And then we remembered we hadn't paid
[1:01:28] tithes for the week before. Remember,
[1:01:31] we had no money.
[1:01:36] We had no food.
[1:01:38] And we're like, well, we need food.
[1:01:40] That's important.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; I need to pay tithes. That's more
[1:01:44] important.
[1:01:47] And I made this the decision. I said,
[1:01:49] "Okay, let us pay tithes."
[1:01:53] And I want to say it's easy to say it,
[1:01:54] but when you have to do it,
[1:01:57] &gt;&gt; when you've got someone relying on you,
[1:02:03] And I wasn't going to be paid for that
[1:02:04] week off work.
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; As I logged in on the bank,
[1:02:11] &gt;&gt; I had been paid for the week.
[1:02:16] I hadn't even done it yet. I just made
[1:02:18] the decision.
[1:02:20] So I want to say wherever you are in
[1:02:22] life, whether you got no money, put God
[1:02:25] first.
[1:02:31] Amen. Let's stand to our feet.
[1:02:33] &gt;&gt; I want to say a special thank you again
[1:02:35] to our brother Buzz.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; I enjoy your sense of humor. It's very
[1:02:43] Australian.
[1:02:47] Let's turn our Bibles to First Kings.
[1:02:52] &gt;&gt; I also want to say a very special thank
[1:02:54] you to two sisters.
[1:03:01] Sister Mary and Sister Shalom, they've
[1:03:03] been taking very good care of us.
[1:03:06] Shalom. We greatly appreciate you. Thank
[1:03:09] you very much for making our stay more
[1:03:11] comfortable.
[1:03:14] First Kings chapter 18.
[1:03:19] And before I read that, there's one
[1:03:21] thing I wanted to get to last yesterday,
[1:03:23] but I didn't get to.
[1:03:28] I was talking about the thoughts and
[1:03:30] temptations
[1:03:33] and I want to say there's no prayer that
[1:03:35] can remove the temptation.
[1:03:38] There's no prayer that will remove the
[1:03:39] thoughts.
[1:03:42] As brother Brandon would say,
[1:03:45] the birds are flying overhead.
[1:03:48] Just don't let them roost.
[1:03:52] So whatever that species of bird is or
[1:03:54] color of bird to you,
[1:03:58] keep it moving on.
[1:04:01] Amen. You have to capture it in your
[1:04:03] mind because the greatest battle ever
[1:04:05] fought is in your mind.
[1:04:09] First Kings 18:36
[1:04:18] and it says first Kings 18:36,
[1:04:21] "And it came to pass at the time of the
[1:04:23] offering of the evening sacrifice that
[1:04:26] Elijah the prophet came near and
[1:04:28] said,"Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and of
[1:04:31] Israel, let it be known this day that
[1:04:33] thou art God in Israel and that I am thy
[1:04:37] servant and and that I have done all
[1:04:38] these things at thy word.
[1:04:51] Hear
[1:05:03] me, oh Lord. Hear me. That this people
[1:05:06] may know that thou art the Lord God, and
[1:05:08] that thou hast turned their heart back
[1:05:10] again.
[1:05:23] Then the fire of the Lord fell and it
[1:05:25] consumed the burnt sacrifice and the
[1:05:27] wood and the stones and the dust and it
[1:05:30] licked up the water that was in the
[1:05:31] trench.
[1:05:41] And when all the people saw it, they
[1:05:43] fell on their face and they said, "The
[1:05:45] Lord, he is the God. The Lord, he is the
[1:05:48] God."
[1:05:57] And Elijah said unto them, "Take the
[1:05:59] prophets of Baal. Let not one of them
[1:06:02] escape." And they took them. And Elijah
[1:06:04] brought them down to the brook Kishon
[1:06:06] and slew them there.
[1:06:20] And Elijah said unto Ahab, "Get thee up,
[1:06:24] eat and drink, for there is a sound of
[1:06:26] abundance of rain."
[1:06:35] And so Ahab went up to eat and to drink.
[1:06:38] And Elijah went up to the top of Mount
[1:06:40] top top of Carmel, and he cast himself
[1:06:42] down upon the earth, and he put his face
[1:06:44] between his knees.
[1:06:57] And he said to his servant, "Go up now.
[1:06:59] Look toward the sea." And he went up.
[1:07:02] And he looked and and said, "There is
[1:07:04] nothing." And he said, "Go again seven
[1:07:06] times.
[1:07:19] And it came to pass at the seventh time
[1:07:22] that he said, "Behold, there ariseth a
[1:07:24] little cloud out of the sea like a man's
[1:07:27] hand." And he said, "Go up and say unto
[1:07:30] Ahab, prepare thy chariot, get thee
[1:07:33] down, that the rain stop thee not.
[1:07:57] A word of prayer. Lord Jesus, we've read
[1:08:00] your word and oh God, we ask that you
[1:08:03] come and add life to the words that have
[1:08:05] been read
[1:08:07] that may have an impact on our hearts.
[1:08:09] Oh God,
[1:08:11] come and change us. We pray in Jesus
[1:08:14] precious name. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may
[1:08:17] take your seats.
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; I want to speak on the showdown.
[1:08:22] &gt;&gt; The showdown.
[1:08:24] This is a final test or a confrontation
[1:08:27] that is intended to settle a dispute.
[1:08:39] Down through the Bible, there's been
[1:08:40] disputes.
[1:08:45] There's two sides to a dispute.
[1:08:49] Evidence is needed to settle the
[1:08:51] dispute.
[1:08:55] bring evidence.
[1:08:58] But you can read in the Bible. Every
[1:09:00] time there's a dispute, God reigns
[1:09:03] supreme.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; And if you fall asleep on me, I'm
[1:09:08] looking.
[1:09:10] I'll summon the deacon.
[1:09:15] So, Brother Ramon would say that Elijah
[1:09:18] was going on a vision.
[1:09:23] said, "All this have I done at thy
[1:09:26] word."
[1:09:31] So in the Pergamian church age,
[1:09:35] brother Brandon would say, "Then in the
[1:09:36] latter rain will come a Mount Carmel
[1:09:38] showdown."
[1:09:44] Carefully.
[1:09:46] Watch it carefully now to see it in the
[1:09:48] word.
[1:09:51] John was the forerunner of Malachi 3.
[1:09:56] He slanted the former reign and he was
[1:09:58] rejected by the organizations of his
[1:10:01] day.
[1:10:06] Jesus came and he had a mount
[1:10:08] transfiguration showdown.
[1:10:15] The second forerunner of Christ,
[1:10:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham,
[1:10:23] Jesus will be the showdown between the
[1:10:25] denominations and the creeds.
[1:10:31] For he will come to back up his word and
[1:10:34] take his bride in the rapture.
[1:10:40] The first showdown was Mount Carmel.
[1:10:46] The second one was Mount
[1:10:47] Transfiguration.
[1:10:50] &gt;&gt; And the third will be Mount Zion.
[1:10:55] So now we can read in the scripture
[1:10:58] on Mount Carmel, fire fell from heaven
[1:11:03] &gt;&gt; and that fire falling from heaven proved
[1:11:06] that Elijah's ministry came from God.
[1:11:13] Elijah could have said a lot of
[1:11:14] different things,
[1:11:16] but when the fire fell, it showed that
[1:11:19] God was vindicating his prophet.
[1:11:24] And you read in the scripture, the cloud
[1:11:26] rose from the sea.
[1:11:30] What is it? A sea is a multitude
[1:11:33] or a church or a denomination.
[1:11:36] What is it?
[1:11:37] coming out of a church
[1:11:42] and then you see Mount Transfiguration
[1:11:47] that John the Baptist ministry
[1:11:50] of God.
[1:11:52] You might disagree with the ministry.
[1:11:55] But when God vindicates it,
[1:11:58] tough luck to you.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; A lot of people argue. God says that is
[1:12:06] my prophet.
[1:12:09] On Mount Transfiguration,
[1:12:13] the scripture says a voice came from the
[1:12:16] cloud.
[1:12:18] &gt;&gt; From the cloud
[1:12:21] and it says, "This is my son.
[1:12:24] Hear ye him."
[1:12:27] At the river, when John the Baptist
[1:12:29] baptized him,
[1:12:32] the voice said, "This is my son." and
[1:12:34] stop there
[1:12:38] on a mountain.
[1:12:40] Jesus was adopted as the son of God.
[1:12:45] So you can see now that like getting the
[1:12:48] Holy Ghost is not adoption.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; But getting the Holy Ghost takes you
[1:12:54] onto adoption.
[1:12:57] So you see now the tutor takes you onto
[1:13:00] adoption.
[1:13:04] So, how do I know I'm adopted?
[1:13:07] &gt;&gt; How do you go when your life falls
[1:13:09] apart?
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; As we say in Australia,
[1:13:16] can you do you?
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Can you do you?
[1:13:23] &gt;&gt; What do you do under pressure?
[1:13:26] What do you do when something in life
[1:13:29] just swipes you?
[1:13:32] What do you do when someone sits in your
[1:13:35] chair?
[1:13:36] It's your chair. They sat there. What do
[1:13:40] you do?
[1:13:42] What do you do when someone side passes
[1:13:45] you on the road, steals your car park?
[1:13:51] Your reaction to life circumstances show
[1:13:54] your position.
[1:13:59] Or does the tutor need to come back to
[1:14:00] you and say, "Come on, get back up.
[1:14:02] Let's keep going."
[1:14:07] The tutor leads you into all truth.
[1:14:14] &gt;&gt; So you see, when God vindicates his
[1:14:16] prophet, you can't argue with that voice
[1:14:18] no more.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; So now we are coming to Mount Zion.
[1:14:27] And brother Brandon would tell us in the
[1:14:28] future home message,
[1:14:31] Mount Zion is always the bride.
[1:14:36] So we are coming to a bride showdown.
[1:14:41] There was a prophet Elijah in this day.
[1:14:45] There was a cloud in this day.
[1:14:50] So you start to see three showdowns,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; three Elijah,
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; three clouds,
[1:14:58] and each time is God vindicating.
[1:15:02] This is my mouthpiece.
[1:15:04] So we can argue as much as we want.
[1:15:08] God does not require our opinion.
[1:15:11] God does not require our interpretation.
[1:15:16] And as we say, build a bridge and get
[1:15:18] over it.
[1:15:22] Tough luck. God does not need our
[1:15:25] opinion.
[1:15:27] Ask to believe the word that he has
[1:15:29] spoken.
[1:15:33] But so many people can't see the cloud
[1:15:36] rising
[1:15:38] because they're blinded by a prophet.
[1:15:43] Ahab was too busy looking at Elijah,
[1:15:49] too busy looking at the mistakes in the
[1:15:51] message
[1:15:53] to see that God was vindicating the
[1:15:55] message
[1:15:58] and they miss why he was sent.
[1:16:04] And I like that quote where brother
[1:16:05] Brandham says,
[1:16:07] "Pay no attention to the messenger.
[1:16:11] Follow
[1:16:13] the message.
[1:16:15] Why? Because the bridegroom has come.
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; In the story of Elohim,
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; Elohim, sorry, Eleazar Eleazar. When
[1:16:27] Rebecca came to Isaac,
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; Rebecca didn't look at Eleazar Rebecca,
[1:16:35] I prefer you
[1:16:37] over the bridegroom.
[1:16:40] But the scripture says she got off the
[1:16:43] message and looked at the Christ.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Got off the camel, shall I say?
[1:16:50] &gt;&gt; And I looked at her bridegroom.
[1:16:54] She didn't say, "Elas, you're more
[1:16:56] handsome than
[1:17:00] you've got the gifts.
[1:17:02] You've got the gifts."
[1:17:04] But she said, "That is my bridegroom.
[1:17:08] about paying no attention to the
[1:17:10] messenger.
[1:17:12] Follow the message.
[1:17:16] Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:18] &gt;&gt; So you see in Mount Carmel,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; they went and looked seven times.
[1:17:24] We've been looking seven times,
[1:17:28] seven church ages.
[1:17:31] And now in the evening time of the
[1:17:33] evening sacrifice,
[1:17:35] the seventh time
[1:17:37] I see a cloud rising out of a
[1:17:40] denomination.
[1:17:42] A cloud like a man's hand
[1:17:46] s Us
[1:17:52] Acts chapter one.
[1:17:55] The disciples are staring
[1:17:59] and the angel comes
[1:18:02] and says, "What are you staring at?"
[1:18:06] And they say, "See that cloud? That's
[1:18:08] what we're looking at."
[1:18:12] And the angel says, "The same way he
[1:18:15] left, the same way he'll return,
[1:18:19] he'll return for his bride on a cloud.
[1:18:24] Why stare and gaze?
[1:18:27] Our Lord has returned,
[1:18:30] for the Lord himself shall descend.
[1:18:36] with a trump
[1:18:38] and a dead in Christ shall rise
[1:18:42] and brother would say he does all three
[1:18:45] as he descends.
[1:18:48] &gt;&gt; So where are we standing?
[1:18:51] I'm expecting one Sunday morning
[1:18:55] for my loved ones to walk down through
[1:18:57] the aisle
[1:19:00] and they start telling me about the
[1:19:01] other side.
[1:19:04] Faith starts to rise in my heart.
[1:19:08] Set our wings to the winds of faith.
[1:19:14] In the evening time of the seventh age,
[1:19:16] I see a cloud.
[1:19:21] Christ is here.
[1:19:24] So, can I say the cloud isn't Christ?
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; It's just identifying
[1:19:32] dwelling place,
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; identifying his dwelling place.
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; So, if he has descended,
[1:19:43] there must have been somewhere for him
[1:19:45] to go.
[1:19:48] &gt;&gt; I've got a ministry
[1:19:51] to declare his coming
[1:19:54] here
[1:19:57] returned in bride form.
[1:20:01] so full of love and the fruits of the
[1:20:03] spirit.
[1:20:06] Amen.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; That Christ is still living after 2,000
[1:20:11] years.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Are we awake?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Brother Brandon would say,
[1:20:18] "When the groom comes,
[1:20:21] will it not be the bride?
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Will it not be the bride?
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Will he will it not be the bride?"
[1:20:30] So people and there's a lot of websites
[1:20:32] against this sort of thing
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; and people would say it's a fluke that
[1:20:38] brother Brandham took to vindicate his
[1:20:40] ministry.
[1:20:44] &gt;&gt; But to those with a revelation
[1:20:47] we say I see a cloud
[1:20:51] in the evening time of the seventh age.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; It didn't come in any other age.
[1:20:58] It didn't come in any other age,
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; but it's my Lord up there.
[1:21:06] The Supreme Judge coming down,
[1:21:09] the glory of God coming down.
[1:21:12] Prophecy coming to pass.
[1:21:16] People desire the glory. They don't want
[1:21:20] the cloud.
[1:21:22] If you want the glory of God,
[1:21:25] you need the cloud.
[1:21:28] The cloud is identifying
[1:21:31] where the glory of God is.
[1:21:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; In the rising of the sun,
[1:21:42] last start of the sermon,
[1:21:45] brother Brandham's talking about this
[1:21:47] cloud.
[1:21:49] He says, "Well, if you turn the picture
[1:21:50] like this and look,
[1:21:54] you can probably see it from the
[1:21:55] audience.
[1:21:57] Jesus Christ
[1:22:01] sees eyes
[1:22:04] here as perfect as could be wearing the
[1:22:08] white wig of supreme deity and judge on
[1:22:12] all heaven and earth.
[1:22:15] The judge has descended.
[1:22:19] So can you see his eyes, his nose, his
[1:22:21] mouth?
[1:22:23] The congregation says,
[1:22:26] "Just turn the picture from the way they
[1:22:28] had it.
[1:22:31] Turn this away,
[1:22:34] the way it's supposed to be."
[1:22:38] He said, "He is supreme judge.
[1:22:42] There is none other but him."
[1:22:45] And that is a perfect identification.
[1:22:48] Again,
[1:22:50] identification
[1:22:52] that this message is the truth.
[1:22:57] God vindicating in a cloud. Once again,
[1:23:02] this Elijah ministry has come from God.
[1:23:08] He says in rising of the sun,
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; he says that you see the face. He said
[1:23:14] it's turning to the right. This is
[1:23:15] right, isn't it? Right.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; It's different in Australia. We We're
[1:23:20] different.
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; Turn to the right. He says he's where he
[1:23:26] looks to the repented sinner.
[1:23:33] Is there a repented sinner here?
[1:23:37] So can I say you are identified in that
[1:23:40] cloud
[1:23:44] that when they turn to the right
[1:23:48] judge
[1:23:49] of all heavens and earth
[1:23:52] declaring
[1:23:54] you never done it in the first place.
[1:24:00] So let me say as the cloud is
[1:24:03] descending,
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; let me accept God's mercy.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; Judgment is taking place for the bride
[1:24:12] on this side.
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; Judgment taking place on this side.
[1:24:19] And brother would say, brother says
[1:24:23] says when you get to judgment, if you're
[1:24:25] not bride, when you get to judgment,
[1:24:28] he says,
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; you'll be asked, did you know the truth?
[1:24:35] Because when you reject the cloud,
[1:24:38] you're rejecting the glory.
[1:24:41] You're not just rejecting a cloud.
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; You're rejecting the supreme judge of
[1:24:46] heavens and earth
[1:24:48] who is coming down to declare you
[1:24:51] spotless.
[1:24:55] And when you reject it, you stand before
[1:24:58] God with a blackened soul.
[1:25:04] You stand before God as a sinner.
[1:25:08] You stand guilty.
[1:25:11] because you've rejected God's provided
[1:25:14] way.
[1:25:16] You've rejected God's righteous
[1:25:18] judgment.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; So if you don't understand it,
[1:25:25] leave it alone.
[1:25:27] Don't reject it. Leave it alone. I want
[1:25:31] to be declared guiltless on this side.
[1:25:38] Let me be judged on this side.
[1:25:42] Let me hear him say, "Well done." This
[1:25:44] side
[1:25:47] is available.
[1:25:50] The sin question is answered. It's not a
[1:25:53] problem no more.
[1:25:59] Sin isn't a concern no more.
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Sin isn't a concern no more.
[1:26:07] Let me go to my purpose.
[1:26:11] But the thing is
[1:26:14] there's two sides of scripture. There's
[1:26:15] a kora.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; And what is the attraction on the
[1:26:22] mountain?
[1:26:25] He says the attraction always brings the
[1:26:27] critics come to criticize.
[1:26:34] Some come for curiosity.
[1:26:38] But he says it also attracts the eagles
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; because where the food is,
[1:26:45] &gt;&gt; the eagles will be gathered.
[1:26:47] And the scripture says there's a famine
[1:26:49] out there.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; There's a famine out there,
[1:26:53] not for food or water,
[1:26:56] but for hearing the word of God.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; You must recognize what you have.
[1:27:03] You cannot recognize who you are
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; until you recognize what you have.
[1:27:11] And when you
[1:27:14] and when you recognize what you have,
[1:27:17] you can go on to what you are. Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Adam would say,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; he says Elijah had to accept what God
[1:27:30] sent.
[1:27:36] Elijah's expecting rain.
[1:27:40] He gets a cloud about you this big.
[1:27:45] God, that ain't going to be enough.
[1:27:50] But Elijah
[1:27:52] accepted
[1:27:54] what God sent.
[1:27:57] This ministry might look simple.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; I can tuck in with a seventh grade
[1:28:03] education and a Kentucky in with a
[1:28:08] &gt;&gt; with a bad family tree.
[1:28:12] But if you accept what God said,
[1:28:16] you stand before God
[1:28:18] as sinners
[1:28:20] righteous,
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:25] So let me accept what he sent
[1:28:29] on this side and let me to be declared
[1:28:32] guiltless
[1:28:34] of this side
[1:28:36] while the blood is available
[1:28:39] because my backsliden brother.
[1:28:43] There's coming a time
[1:28:46] where the blood is going to leave that
[1:28:48] mercy seat.
[1:28:51] Stand before God
[1:28:54] with every sin you ever did in your
[1:28:57] life.
[1:28:59] For while there's time,
[1:29:01] while the blood is there,
[1:29:04] lay your sins at the foot of the cross.
[1:29:07] Lay your burdens on the foot of the
[1:29:09] cross.
[1:29:11] say, "Oh God, I'm pushing on the upward
[1:29:13] way."
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And people would say, "The message is
[1:29:20] bondage." And people
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; people would say,
[1:29:26] "The message is
[1:29:28] I want to say
[1:29:30] eternal separation from God
[1:29:35] is bondage.
[1:29:37] Going to hell is bondage.
[1:29:41] death is bondage.
[1:29:44] So if the message is bondage to you,
[1:29:49] you just haven't fallen in love
[1:29:54] with the message.
[1:29:58] They say if you love your job,
[1:30:01] you never work a day in your life.
[1:30:07] I work every day.
[1:30:16] But if you fall in love with God,
[1:30:20] &gt;&gt; with the message,
[1:30:22] it's no longer work to go to church.
[1:30:27] It's no longer work to walk the right
[1:30:30] kind of life.
[1:30:33] It's no longer work to turn your head
[1:30:35] when a Jezebel walks by.
[1:30:40] your boyfriend.
[1:30:44] Amen.
[1:30:47] Just fall in love
[1:30:50] and you'll say, "I want to please my
[1:30:52] Lord
[1:30:55] because naturally in a marriage,
[1:30:58] a husband wants to please the wife,
[1:31:02] the wife wants to please the husband.
[1:31:05] And God has come down.
[1:31:07] &gt;&gt; And he says if you live this kind of
[1:31:09] life.
[1:31:12] This is a God pleasing life.
[1:31:16] Pride says
[1:31:18] I want to live a God pleasing life.
[1:31:24] Amen. Amen. So God vindicates his
[1:31:28] prophet. Our opinion does not matter.
[1:31:34] And then brother Brandham says when the
[1:31:35] seventh angel sounds all the mysteries
[1:31:38] are done
[1:31:44] but it's rejected.
[1:31:47] It's given for them to understand but
[1:31:49] rejected.
[1:31:53] It's given to them so they can go to
[1:31:55] heaven
[1:31:58] rejected.
[1:32:00] Why is because it's not in them to
[1:32:03] believe.
[1:32:06] I'm so thankful
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; that when God released me from eternity,
[1:32:12] he put the word of God in me.
[1:32:16] &gt;&gt; That when the perfect word of God come,
[1:32:20] the perfect seed of God in me that
[1:32:24] responded to the word
[1:32:28] that sounds like home to me.
[1:32:33] is nothing but the truth.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Son of man
[1:32:40] will be revealed in a body of flesh.
[1:32:46] You people,
[1:32:48] the church,
[1:32:52] so they'll see Christ here on earth,
[1:32:55] not in the form they're looking for.
[1:32:59] Christ is here. When he looks like you,
[1:33:04] he looks a little familiar.
[1:33:09] Amen. When you look in the mirror, what
[1:33:12] is looking back at you?
[1:33:16] So, we have come to Mount Zion. Now,
[1:33:20] what is it? There's a denomination
[1:33:23] that's saying we are the bride.
[1:33:27] There's another denomination saying we
[1:33:29] are the bride
[1:33:31] and the name of the denomination.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; The name of the denomination,
[1:33:38] it tells me.
[1:33:44] Amen.
[1:33:47] The name of the denomination tells me
[1:33:49] where they stopped believing.
[1:33:54] I can see where they stopped.
[1:33:58] I can see where they stopped.
[1:34:04] There's a lot of different camps in the
[1:34:06] message.
[1:34:09] They identify themselves by their name.
[1:34:14] The thunders
[1:34:16] I wonder where they stopped.
[1:34:21] The two souls doctrine
[1:34:24] tapes only
[1:34:28] something in the bride
[1:34:30] says I've come here.
[1:34:33] Let me go a little further.
[1:34:36] Let me go on to adoption.
[1:34:39] Be ye therefore perfect.
[1:34:42] Let me go a little further
[1:34:44] into all things are possible.
[1:34:51] Amen.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] I'm going to skip over a few things, but
[1:34:56] when Moses built his tabernacle,
[1:35:00] he had to build it exactly like it was
[1:35:02] shown in heaven.
[1:35:06] The
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; tabernacle had three rooms.
[1:35:10] Moses couldn't say, "God, I have a
[1:35:12] better idea.
[1:35:17] I need a sun room.
[1:35:22] I need somewhere. I need a kitchen in
[1:35:24] the tabernacle.
[1:35:26] I need a little sun room for me in the
[1:35:28] tabernacle.
[1:35:31] You had to build it exactly like it was
[1:35:33] in heaven.
[1:35:37] Designed in heaven,
[1:35:39] built on earth.
[1:35:43] If Moses had put his own opinion, his
[1:35:46] architectural twist to it,
[1:35:52] God never would have come down to that
[1:35:54] dwelling place
[1:35:59] because it was designed in heaven
[1:36:05] for God to dwell in.
[1:36:09] I don't want to I don't have the time,
[1:36:10] but you are a triune being.
[1:36:16] And when the tabernacle was completed,
[1:36:20] God come down in a cloud,
[1:36:24] what was he doing?
[1:36:27] Identifying,
[1:36:28] I have somewhere to be
[1:36:32] identifying
[1:36:34] his dwelling place.
[1:36:37] Psalm 102 verse16
[1:36:42] Psalm 102. Psalm 102.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read it to save time. When
[1:36:49] the Lord shall build up Zion,
[1:36:54] he shall appear
[1:36:56] in his glory.
[1:37:00] When the Lord shall build up Zion
[1:37:04] is Zion.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; I can't hear you. I can't hear you. Wake
[1:37:10] up. Come on.
[1:37:13] Zion is always the bride.
[1:37:17] The Lord shall build up the bride.
[1:37:22] Shall appear
[1:37:24] in his glory.
[1:37:27] Amen. What is he doing?
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; He's identifying
[1:37:32] the tabernacle
[1:37:34] is ready.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; Know ye not? Know ye not that ye are the
[1:37:40] temple of the Holy Ghost.
[1:37:46] So the building is done. Down comes the
[1:37:49] glory.
[1:37:53] Solomon's temple.
[1:37:56] Down comes the glory.
[1:38:02] The message has come
[1:38:05] to prepare you
[1:38:07] to be the powerhouse of God.
[1:38:12] When Jesus was here on earth, he said
[1:38:14] the foxes have holes, the birds have
[1:38:18] nests,
[1:38:19] the son of man
[1:38:22] has nowhere to lay his head.
[1:38:25] But in the evening time of the seventh
[1:38:28] age,
[1:38:30] I see a cloud descending.
[1:38:33] Why? The son of man has a place to lay
[1:38:38] his head.
[1:38:40] The word is now resting. The word is
[1:38:43] resting
[1:38:45] in a multimembered body.
[1:38:49] But God is too great
[1:38:53] to be displayed in one person.
[1:38:57] He has a multi-membered bride
[1:39:01] attribute of God
[1:39:04] deposited into each one.
[1:39:08] They went each bride member
[1:39:11] back to their position.
[1:39:14] For without you, without you, we are
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; without you.
[1:39:20] They cannot be made perfect.
[1:39:23] Each one has a part of God.
[1:39:28] Each one has a nugget of God.
[1:39:32] God is relying on you
[1:39:35] to bring that attribute
[1:39:39] to its rightful position
[1:39:44] has come to dwell
[1:39:46] in you.
[1:39:48] So don't go back to God sent a prophet.
[1:39:52] Follow the message.
[1:40:01] Amen. Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; God didn't come down
[1:40:06] just to be seen in the sky.
[1:40:10] God didn't come just to be talked about
[1:40:13] and debated
[1:40:16] to arrest him.
[1:40:20] Can I quote the message
[1:40:22] is in you as much as you let him be in
[1:40:26] you.
[1:40:30] You become the glory of God.
[1:40:35] God is saying
[1:40:37] the temple is done.
[1:40:40] I'm coming down,
[1:40:42] but it must be built through the open.
[1:40:49] You see why we had to have a prophet? We
[1:40:51] do.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; We had to have a prophet
[1:40:54] to tie up every loose end
[1:40:58] so that the building could be completed
[1:41:02] so that God could look
[1:41:04] and say, "Now I've got a place to rest.
[1:41:10] If God can be in a burning bush,
[1:41:15] if God can be in a whirlwind,
[1:41:19] if God can talk through a donkey,
[1:41:22] talk through a donkey
[1:41:25] and be the apostles,
[1:41:28] if God can be in brother Brandham,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; can he not be in you
[1:41:35] and be the same God
[1:41:37] that was in a burning bush.
[1:41:41] I can't be God,
[1:41:44] but God can become me
[1:41:47] because God is too great to be in one.
[1:41:52] He's in a multi-membered body.
[1:42:03] Well done.
[1:42:06] Amen. I might sound crazy. I'm happy
[1:42:09] this way.
[1:42:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; The purpose of God being
[1:42:16] so can I say
[1:42:19] the fire falling was evidence
[1:42:23] Elijah come from God.
[1:42:27] The voice speaking from the cloud
[1:42:31] was the evidence that John the Baptist
[1:42:33] come from God.
[1:42:37] Now we are come to Mount Zion.
[1:42:41] Is that what the scripture says?
[1:42:44] Now we have come to Mount Zion.
[1:42:49] So if we come to Mount Zion,
[1:42:52] God is looking for evidence.
[1:42:55] Who will be the evidence? Who will be
[1:42:58] the evidence
[1:43:00] that this Elijah ministry
[1:43:03] &gt;&gt; come from God?
[1:43:06] Satan is going through the earth
[1:43:09] saying where is my evidence?
[1:43:12] God is saying where is my evidence?
[1:43:16] You become the evidence
[1:43:20] by the life you live.
[1:43:23] You would have been stoned in the church
[1:43:25] ages.
[1:43:26] &gt;&gt; Stoned in the church ages.
[1:43:30] And now the word has gone further.
[1:43:35] There's no life in denominations.
[1:43:39] If there was life, there would be
[1:43:40] evidence of life.
[1:43:43] when there's no evidence of life.
[1:43:46] But as the bride comes into her
[1:43:48] position,
[1:43:51] there's evidence of life.
[1:43:55] The denomination has nothing to bring to
[1:43:58] the showdown.
[1:44:02] God says, "I've got evidence.
[1:44:06] I can prove that brother Brandham was
[1:44:08] Elijah.
[1:44:12] the bride.
[1:44:14] The chosen one
[1:44:17] steps
[1:44:20] the bride.
[1:44:24] You're not just some church mouse.
[1:44:29] You are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:44:33] Never let Satan put you in the corner.
[1:44:38] You are the audience.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; You are the audience of God.
[1:44:46] You are not some church mouse.
[1:44:50] Here's the evidence.
[1:44:53] Opinion doesn't matter no more.
[1:44:57] God vindicated his prophet.
[1:45:01] Cloud come down.
[1:45:03] God spoke.
[1:45:05] Here's the evidence.
[1:45:09] Amen. Amen. So they can fuss all they
[1:45:12] want.
[1:45:15] Did the message come from God?
[1:45:19] Didn't it?
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; Here's the evidence.
[1:45:24] Amen.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; But the FBI can prove it. They'll still
[1:45:27] reject it. FBI.
[1:45:32] They don't have the seed in them.
[1:45:37] The seed they have
[1:45:40] hybridized.
[1:45:43] They've watered it in. They've watered
[1:45:45] it down.
[1:45:48] And the life of Christ has been removed
[1:45:52] from the church.
[1:45:54] The life went further.
[1:45:57] And the bride said,
[1:45:59] "Be it unto me according to your word.
[1:46:04] I may not understand every revelation,
[1:46:08] but I believe every revelation.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; You don't need to understand it all.
[1:46:19] You just need to believe
[1:46:22] who you are
[1:46:24] and the spirit
[1:46:27] will lead you into all truth.
[1:46:31] And if it's required for a rapture, if
[1:46:34] it's required for a rapture,
[1:46:38] God will reveal it to you.
[1:46:43] You are the at the Mount Zion showdown.
[1:46:52] Psalm 132,
[1:46:56] verse 13.
[1:46:58] I'm going to read it to save time. Psalm
[1:47:01] 132,
[1:47:04] verse 13.
[1:47:07] For the Lord hath chosen Zion.
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; The Lord hath chosen Zion.
[1:47:18] Psalm 132:13. For the Lord hath chosen
[1:47:22] Zion.
[1:47:27] What is Zion?
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; He, the scripture says, he hath desired
[1:47:33] it.
[1:47:36] &gt;&gt; He hath desired it for his habitation.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Who are you?
[1:47:45] The Lord has chosen you.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Because he desires you.
[1:47:54] &gt;&gt; Don't let no one tell you.
[1:47:56] that God doesn't love you.
[1:47:59] The Lord hath chosen Zion.
[1:48:05] Amen.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 14, he says, "This is my
[1:48:09] rest forever."
[1:48:14] Here will I dwell.
[1:48:19] Psalm 132 verse 14.
[1:48:24] This is my rest forever.
[1:48:28] Will I dwell
[1:48:30] for I
[1:48:33] desired it.
[1:48:37] So who are you?
[1:48:39] Desired of Almighty.
[1:48:43] God.
[1:48:46] You aren't just some church attendee.
[1:48:50] You are just some person sitting in the
[1:48:52] congregation.
[1:48:54] You are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:48:58] We have desired you.
[1:49:05] That's why we need the message.
[1:49:09] Because if you reject the message,
[1:49:13] God doesn't desire you
[1:49:18] because you haven't been built up to
[1:49:20] Zion.
[1:49:24] He can't inhabit the building if the
[1:49:26] building isn't ready.
[1:49:30] So he sent a prophet. He sent a prophet.
[1:49:34] And brother Brandham would say in the
[1:49:36] church age book,
[1:49:39] that the messenger of Revelations 10:7,
[1:49:44] God will vindicate his ministry.
[1:49:49] Preach the truth as Elijah did.
[1:49:53] We are ready for the Mount Zion
[1:49:55] showdown.
[1:50:01] We're the bride. We're not the bride.
[1:50:02] We're the bride. You're not the bride.
[1:50:06] There's a dispute going on.
[1:50:10] Who is the bride?
[1:50:12] But when God says,
[1:50:14] "I'm judging the world by my word.
[1:50:19] &gt;&gt; So let me summon the word.
[1:50:23] He turns around. He turns around. He
[1:50:27] looks my brother in the eye
[1:50:30] and he said, "Come forward, my word.
[1:50:34] Heavens and earth is passing away.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Because the word is in him,
[1:50:41] &gt;&gt; he shall never pass away
[1:50:44] and here will I dwell forever.
[1:50:49] You have become as eternal
[1:50:52] as God is.
[1:50:57] Amen.
[1:50:59] God's great purpose
[1:51:02] &gt;&gt; preeminence in Jesus
[1:51:04] in Jesus.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; And we can say amen. We can see he did.
[1:51:10] But he wants to have the preeminence in
[1:51:12] the bride.
[1:51:18] But Adam lost it in the garden.
[1:51:22] Jesus went back in the garden.
[1:51:28] Jesus died more death in the garden
[1:51:32] than on the cross.
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; And you know what happened in the
[1:51:36] garden?
[1:51:38] &gt;&gt; He prayed and said, "Not my will,
[1:51:42] but I will die."
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; And brother would say,
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted to stay with his disciples.
[1:51:54] Jesus wanted a family.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; Jesus wanted a house.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; But there was a greater purpose to him.
[1:52:08] You might want a lot of things.
[1:52:11] You might want to get married, my
[1:52:12] brother.
[1:52:15] But when you say, "Not my will,"
[1:52:18] God takes you down the road to your
[1:52:21] purpose.
[1:52:27] Father, if thou be willing,
[1:52:31] remove this stuff from me.
[1:52:35] Lord, I don't want to go this way.
[1:52:42] Nevertheless,
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; not my will,
[1:52:47] but thy will be done.
[1:52:50] And when he said that,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; an angel came, an angel has come, an
[1:52:57] angel has come to strengthen you.
[1:53:02] Read the word
[1:53:05] as you surrender your life.
[1:53:09] It'll lead you to Calvary.
[1:53:15] And the scripture says he prayed more
[1:53:18] earnestly.
[1:53:22] Blood, sweat and blood.
[1:53:25] And science tells us
[1:53:28] that deep grief
[1:53:32] they cause you to sweat blood
[1:53:36] grief this man was bearing.
[1:53:42] I've never sweated blood. I bet you've
[1:53:45] never sweated blood.
[1:53:48] We shouldn't bet.
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; Just throw that in there,
[1:53:56] &gt;&gt; Australians. We shouldn't do it.
[1:54:01] Australia.
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; Just making sure you're awake. I'm just
[1:54:03] watching.
[1:54:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. The scripture says an angel came
[1:54:10] to strengthen him, to help him go
[1:54:14] through
[1:54:16] what was happening. Our souls were
[1:54:17] hanging in the balance.
[1:54:21] Brother would tell us in the revelation
[1:54:23] series,
[1:54:25] there is a veil of self-will.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; There is a veil of self-will inside each
[1:54:33] of us.
[1:54:38] I like to preach on that veil of
[1:54:40] self-will.
[1:54:44] But Jesus was praying
[1:54:46] He say, "Lord, have your way on this
[1:54:49] throne room."
[1:54:56] Heaven was his throne room.
[1:54:59] Jesus room.
[1:55:03] Man is his throne room. Man is his
[1:55:06] throne room.
[1:55:10] Three different throne rooms.
[1:55:14] But Christ, imagine this. Christ knowing
[1:55:16] full well what is to come.
[1:55:20] Will thine be done.
[1:55:25] I wonder if we knew what was tomorrow.
[1:55:29] When we say not my will.
[1:55:32] If we knew there was a whipping post
[1:55:34] coming,
[1:55:36] father not my will.
[1:55:40] If we knew your brother was going to
[1:55:42] spit in your face,
[1:55:45] father not my will.
[1:55:48] If you knew there was a cross coming,
[1:55:53] father not my will.
[1:55:58] He hadn't died yet. He hadn't risen yet.
[1:56:02] But when he said,
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; "Father, not my will."
[1:56:07] The rest of it was a formality
[1:56:13] because the dove
[1:56:15] was leading the lamb to Calvary.
[1:56:20] It didn't matter what's happening down
[1:56:21] the road. It didn't matter what's
[1:56:23] happening down the road.
[1:56:27] God surrendered his will.
[1:56:30] And if you can surrender your will
[1:56:34] in the garden of life,
[1:56:37] in Satan's garden,
[1:56:41] the rapture becomes a formality for you.
[1:56:48] So don't stress about a rapture.
[1:56:51] Let me say this. You are the rapture.
[1:56:57] The rapture can't go without you. The
[1:57:00] rapture can't go without you.
[1:57:04] until the rapture.
[1:57:07] Just surrender your will.
[1:57:10] Let the veil of self-will
[1:57:14] be born in your life
[1:57:18] and let the dove
[1:57:20] lead you onto the rapture.
[1:57:25] Let me talk about the cross for one
[1:57:27] moment.
[1:57:29] The cross was the most painful way
[1:57:31] invented by man to die.
[1:57:41] Do
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; you know the word excruciating
[1:57:47] it means from the cross
[1:57:51] from the cross.
[1:57:54] And sometimes we see pictures of
[1:57:55] crucifixion.
[1:57:58] They hang them way up in the air,
[1:58:02] but they didn't do it like that.
[1:58:05] They hung them at eye level. Eye level.
[1:58:14] hang them on a main road.
[1:58:18] So that everyone walking past
[1:58:22] could look in that man's eyes,
[1:58:25] see the agony,
[1:58:27] see the pain.
[1:58:29] They say the Greeks invented it.
[1:58:33] The humans perfected it.
[1:58:39] more than just feeling three nails.
[1:58:45] You would suffocate on your own blood.
[1:58:53] Not my will. He knew what was coming.
[1:58:58] He'd have to push himself up on the
[1:59:00] nails.
[1:59:02] trying to get a little breath of air,
[1:59:05] little breath of air
[1:59:08] until his strength ran out.
[1:59:12] Full back down on the nails,
[1:59:17] suffocating on his own.
[1:59:20] He should have died at the whipping
[1:59:22] post. Should have died at the whipping
[1:59:25] post.
[1:59:27] He should have died on the road to
[1:59:29] Golafa.
[1:59:33] But he said,
[1:59:35] "Nobody takes my life.
[1:59:39] I lay my life.
[1:59:42] I must get to the cross.
[1:59:46] Is on the cross.
[1:59:48] I must get to the cross.
[1:59:51] My brother, my sister, we must get to
[1:59:54] the cross.
[1:59:56] Get to a place.
[1:59:58] Die to ourselves.
[2:00:01] lay on me
[2:00:05] from this time on.
[2:00:07] Nobody takes my life.
[2:00:10] Lay my
[2:00:13] cause of the gospel.
[2:00:15] I lay my life down.
[2:00:18] Let me be the evidence
[2:00:21] of this message
[2:00:23] from God.
[2:00:27] Amen.
[2:00:29] I want to be the evidence.
[2:00:34] And they say a man could be alive for
[2:00:36] seven days on a cross.
[2:00:43] Jesus wasn't alive that long. She died
[2:00:47] back there. There
[2:00:51] she was on a cross
[2:00:55] because cursed is a man.
[2:00:58] thatth on a tree.
[2:01:01] He was cursed.
[2:01:04] So you don't have to be cursed.
[2:01:11] That family cursed
[2:01:14] power
[2:01:16] over the believer.
[2:01:19] He was cursed.
[2:01:22] You don't have to be cursed.
[2:01:27] Why has never
[2:01:30] forsaken?
[2:01:32] You never have to be forsaken.
[2:01:36] And if the serpent comes, if the serpent
[2:01:39] comes
[2:01:41] and tells you you are forsaken,
[2:01:52] the veil of self-will.
[2:01:55] He will
[2:01:58] that he never lifted his finger
[2:02:02] to summon angels
[2:02:05] because he knew
[2:02:08] the cross
[2:02:10] must men the breach
[2:02:14] for the joy
[2:02:17] for
[2:02:20] the pain
[2:02:22] and you endure the pain.
[2:02:25] You despise the shame.
[2:02:28] The rapture coming for the bride.
[2:02:33] The body change coming for the bride.
[2:02:38] Must endure for a moment.
[2:02:41] Rapture is here.
[2:02:44] You are the rapture.
[2:02:48] Amen.
[2:02:50] What was that joy?
[2:02:53] That there was a whole crop coming.
[2:02:59] Messiahs.
[2:03:01] &gt;&gt; Should I water that down?
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; A whole crop coming.
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; Of messiahs.
[2:03:11] And if that's too strong for you,
[2:03:15] let me say a whole crop of Messiah.
[2:03:24] The joy of fellowship,
[2:03:28] the joy of we're going back to Eden.
[2:03:34] But you can't go back to Eden
[2:03:36] until the veil of self-will
[2:03:40] in your life
[2:03:42] is torn.
[2:03:45] The veil in the temple was torn.
[2:03:49] from top to bottom
[2:03:52] showing no man could tear it.
[2:03:58] It took Almighty God
[2:04:02] to tear the veil.
[2:04:05] Now the power is given to you.
[2:04:09] If you lay your life down,
[2:04:13] veil can be torn.
[2:04:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. The amazing thing about the temple
[2:04:20] was
[2:04:23] the veil was torn.
[2:04:26] Quickly they had to close it.
[2:04:30] Quickly we had to close it.
[2:04:34] We can't let the people see
[2:04:37] that shakina of glory and the shakina
[2:04:40] glory
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; has left the temple
[2:04:47] the people will leave church
[2:04:50] when they see there's no life in the
[2:04:52] church
[2:04:54] so quickly.
[2:04:56] Let us get an atmosphere pumping in this
[2:04:59] building. Let's get an atmosphere in the
[2:05:02] denomination.
[2:05:05] Let's sew the veil up.
[2:05:10] Let's get some entertaining song
[2:05:12] service.
[2:05:15] But when your word comes,
[2:05:19] there's no life in the way
[2:05:23] of glory. The shakana glory had left the
[2:05:26] temple.
[2:05:28] But quickly they closed the veil
[2:05:33] because the Pharisees were actors.
[2:05:39] We never want to act Christianity.
[2:05:43] It's a waste of time.
[2:05:47] We never want to go to church and fall
[2:05:49] asleep.
[2:05:52] My bed at home is a lot more comfortable
[2:05:54] than this chair.
[2:06:06] Amen.
[2:06:09] &gt;&gt; I'll let you drink.
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; The earth shook.
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; Surely
[2:06:19] you have crucified
[2:06:22] the son of God.
[2:06:25] God, brother Brandon would say,
[2:06:29] &gt;&gt; "God was right in his everlasting
[2:06:31] covenant
[2:06:35] in the blood."
[2:06:37] &gt;&gt; Jesus who knew no sin.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; But he said,
[2:06:43] "I'll drink the cup, Lord.
[2:06:46] Sin came upon him
[2:06:49] that you don't have to carry your sin.
[2:06:53] So if you leave this camp,
[2:06:56] carry on your sin,
[2:06:58] your guilt,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; your condemnation,
[2:07:03] there's something wrong somewhere.
[2:07:07] Hear me plain and clear.
[2:07:10] You don't need to carry your sin.
[2:07:14] You don't need to carry your guilt.
[2:07:17] But on the cross,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; he cried.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; It is.
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; He didn't die once for this and forget
[2:07:28] about that.
[2:07:31] But he died once for all.
[2:07:35] So, whatever you're battling,
[2:07:38] &gt;&gt; whatever you're battling,
[2:07:42] &gt;&gt; whatever your fight is,
[2:07:44] &gt;&gt; whatever you're going through,
[2:07:47] &gt;&gt; it is finished.
[2:07:49] You don't need to walk out the doors
[2:07:51] with it.
[2:07:54] It was bruised so you don't have to.
[2:07:58] And then the scripture says he ascended
[2:08:01] up on high and there he is
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; on the right side of the throne
[2:08:09] for my ignorance.
[2:08:13] He's not interceding for my sin.
[2:08:27] Amen.
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; But little by little,
[2:08:31] our ignorance is being removed.
[2:08:35] Preaching
[2:08:36] of the word.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; Preaching of the word.
[2:08:41] Spiritual amnesia.
[2:08:44] Scales on the eyes
[2:08:47] falling off our eyes.
[2:08:49] I just want to bang your head against
[2:08:51] the rock.
[2:08:53] Bang your head against the word
[2:08:56] and watch that spiritual amnesia
[2:09:00] away from the bride.
[2:09:03] When the bride knows who she is,
[2:09:07] the rapture will take place.
[2:09:10] I want to go in rapture.
[2:09:13] Let me get the revelation
[2:09:16] who I am.
[2:09:19] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus decision in the garden paved the
[2:09:27] way.
[2:09:31] Something just come to my mind and I'm
[2:09:33] going to say it.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; When Jesus ascended up on high,
[2:09:40] he sat down on the right side of the
[2:09:42] throne.
[2:09:47] But when he was here on earth on the
[2:09:48] cross,
[2:09:50] he said, "Father, forgive them.
[2:09:54] They don't know what they do."
[2:09:58] Faith is based on forgiveness.
[2:10:03] And brother Brandham said
[2:10:05] that Jesus believed the words spoken of
[2:10:08] David
[2:10:11] and he will not allow his holy one to
[2:10:13] see corruption.
[2:10:17] He knew corruption set in after 72
[2:10:19] hours.
[2:10:23] Jesus went to the cross.
[2:10:26] believing who he was.
[2:10:30] Believing that in three days I will rise
[2:10:32] again
[2:10:34] because scripture is me
[2:10:38] and all scripture must be fulfilled.
[2:10:41] So bring me a drink.
[2:10:45] He didn't even want the drink.
[2:10:48] But he knew the scripture had to be
[2:10:49] fulfilled.
[2:10:52] He knew he knew. He knew that if he
[2:10:55] didn't ask for it,
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; he could rise from the dead.
[2:11:02] You might not feel like some things,
[2:11:05] but if you don't do it,
[2:11:08] there's going to be no rapture.
[2:11:30] Amen.
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandon would say,
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; "Faith is based on forgiveness."
[2:11:41] Jesus had to have faith in the scripture
[2:11:43] that David wrote to rise from the dead.
[2:11:51] So he said,
[2:11:53] Father,
[2:11:56] Father, forgive them.
[2:11:59] &gt;&gt; If you want to go in a rapture,
[2:12:02] you must forgive.
[2:12:06] &gt;&gt; You must forgive.
[2:12:09] If Jesus didn't forgive,
[2:12:11] there was no resurrection.
[2:12:15] You must forgive.
[2:12:18] It doesn't matter how painful it is.
[2:12:22] You might not want to forgive,
[2:12:26] but you must forgive.
[2:12:29] Father, forgive them. Father,
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; I'm running out of time, but I got one
[2:12:35] more thing on my mind.
[2:12:40] When Steven was being stoned
[2:12:44] and the church members were biting him,
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; could you imagine the church biting the
[2:12:52] pastor?
[2:12:57] I feel like it happens. I'm sure.
[2:13:01] But there he's been stoned.
[2:13:05] The stones are falling on him.
[2:13:09] And he says, "Father, standing
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; on the right side of the throne,
[2:13:16] those who are sitting
[2:13:19] standing,
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; Steven is getting a standing ovation
[2:13:23] from the master.
[2:13:27] Jesus,
[2:13:29] when I was on earth,
[2:13:32] that's what I did.
[2:13:34] This is my son.
[2:13:37] This is my son.
[2:13:40] When you go through things
[2:13:43] say, "Father, forgive them.
[2:13:46] This child
[2:13:49] and you can see Jesus
[2:13:51] standing on the right side of the
[2:13:53] throne.
[2:14:02] I'm going to close.
[2:14:05] So, brother Brandon would say in 1962,
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; he says, "We're looking for Revelations
[2:14:12] 10:17 to be fulfilled.
[2:14:17] It's prophecy."
[2:14:20] But in what is the attraction on the
[2:14:22] mountain
[2:14:25] 1965?
[2:14:27] He says revelations 10 1-7
[2:14:31] is history.
[2:14:35] So what happened in that three years
[2:14:39] the cloud came down.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; Let me take this for a last scripture.
[2:14:46] Isaiah chapter 43.
[2:14:49] Verse
[2:14:51] N.
[2:14:53] &gt;&gt; I want everyone to turn to this and I'm
[2:14:55] going to close.
[2:15:02] Isaiah 43:3
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; N
[2:15:08] God is looking for evidence.
[2:15:12] Isaiah verse 43:9 says, "Let all the
[2:15:16] nations be gathered together and let the
[2:15:19] people be assembled, come to the
[2:15:21] judgment." He's saying, "Who among them
[2:15:23] can declare this and show us former
[2:15:25] things? Let them bring forth their
[2:15:28] witnesses that they may be justified
[2:15:32] or let them hear and say, it is truth.
[2:15:57] Isaiah 43:10, "Ye are my witnesses,
[2:16:01] saith the Lord, and my servant whom I
[2:16:04] have chosen, that ye may know and
[2:16:08] believe me and understand that I am he.
[2:16:11] Before me there was no God formed,
[2:16:13] neither shall there be after me. Ye are
[2:16:17] my witnesses, he says.
[2:16:34] Let me skip to verse 12. I have declared
[2:16:37] and have saved and I've showed when
[2:16:39] there was no strange God among you.
[2:16:42] Therefore, ye are my witnesses, sayaeth
[2:16:46] the Lord, that I am God.
[2:17:03] Ye are my witnesses.
[2:17:05] The showdown has been won. God's
[2:17:08] evidence is on the scene.
[2:17:12] Revelations 10:11.
[2:17:14] Take the book. Eat the book.
[2:17:17] Testify.
[2:17:19] Prophesy over many nations and kindred
[2:17:23] and tongues.
[2:17:25] Take the word you've received. Take it
[2:17:27] into your heart.
[2:17:29] Prophesy over many nations.
[2:17:32] I am the evidence. I am the witness. Let
[2:17:37] this message come from God.
[2:17:40] But you can't give it out until you have
[2:17:43] it.
[2:17:46] So while you're here,
[2:17:48] &gt;&gt; get it in you.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Paul would say, "Let us run the race."
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Can I say we are in a relay race? You
[2:18:03] know what a relay is?
[2:18:05] The baton has been passed from a
[2:18:07] generation guarantee.
[2:18:10] It's been passed down
[2:18:14] and they run. They save the best runner
[2:18:16] till last
[2:18:22] such a time as this.
[2:18:25] But now
[2:18:27] &gt;&gt; when the world is at its darkest,
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; God has said,
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; "I've got my greatest runner.
[2:18:35] the fastest one.
[2:18:39] There shall be lights.
[2:18:43] Don't drop the battle.
[2:18:46] You disqualified
[2:18:49] the standard.
[2:18:52] I am the evidence.
[2:18:54] I am the wizard.
[2:18:58] Amen.
[2:18:59] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11. By faith, Moses, by faith,
[2:19:01] by faith by faith.
[2:19:05] And then at the end,
[2:19:07] it says they great men that they were
[2:19:13] they were great men,
[2:19:16] but they without us
[2:19:20] cannot be.
[2:19:23] Who are you? You're not just some church
[2:19:26] mouse on the back side of the desert.
[2:19:30] But you have a ministry. You have a
[2:19:33] purpose to declare to declare that this
[2:19:38] ministry
[2:19:39] is a completion
[2:19:42] for
[2:19:44] where is the evidence.
[2:19:46] Let the evidence come.
[2:19:51] I kindly I kindly think
[2:19:54] &gt;&gt; I kind of think he's waiting for us
[2:19:58] &gt;&gt; to finish the job.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; That's what the prophet said.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; Stop looking at the one next to you to
[2:20:06] finish the job.
[2:20:09] We are back on
[2:20:12] all the great men that were with brother
[2:20:14] Brandham.
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; All the great men with brother Brandham.
[2:20:19] They have passed on to their reward.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Passed down to you now.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; You are the revival.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; You are the baton holder.
[2:20:30] &gt;&gt; Don't let no sin
[2:20:33] stop you from possessing who you are.
[2:20:40] So don't wait 40 years to give your life
[2:20:43] to him.
[2:20:45] Do it now.
[2:20:47] Don't wait till your deathbed
[2:20:49] and say, "I wish I'd done something for
[2:20:52] him. Do it now."
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; While you've got energy in your bones
[2:20:58] while there's a life pulsated in you.
[2:21:02] Give me the pattern.
[2:21:04] Let me be the evidence
[2:21:07] and run the race
[2:21:10] to the rapture.
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. God is looking for a
[2:21:16] witness.
[2:21:18] Can I say, can I say I have found the
[2:21:22] witness?
[2:21:24] You have become the message incarnate.
[2:21:27] You can't incarnate.
[2:21:38] Amen. Stand to our feet.
[2:21:46] There was a sister here yesterday who
[2:21:48] sung that song when he was on the cross.
[2:21:56] &gt;&gt; Is that sister here? Can you come and
[2:21:57] sing that again for us
[2:22:00] before she sings it? Let me say this.
[2:22:03] Could you imagine at the end of Moses'
[2:22:04] life?
[2:22:07] If Moses Let me just flip the scripture.
[2:22:09] I'm not changing it. I'm just own story.
[2:22:14] If Moses had become Pharaoh,
[2:22:17] if Moses had let the people go
[2:22:21] and then he gets to the end of time,
[2:22:26] he's at the judgment throne
[2:22:29] and a great big screen rolls down
[2:22:34] and it's playing out Moses' life, what
[2:22:37] it should have been.
[2:22:41] Moses would see the plagues in Egypt.
[2:22:45] He'd see the Red Sea parting
[2:22:50] see the bitter waters made sweet.
[2:22:56] He'd see it all.
[2:22:59] And God would say to Moses,
[2:23:02] "This is what your life should have been
[2:23:03] like.
[2:23:05] But you wanted the glory for yourself.
[2:23:09] You wanted to let the people go in your
[2:23:11] own strength.
[2:23:15] Moses would start sweating and crying.
[2:23:18] Say, "God, let your people go."
[2:23:22] God would say, "That was not my perfect
[2:23:25] will for your life."
[2:23:28] My brother, my sister,
[2:23:30] line your life up with God's perfect
[2:23:33] will.
[2:23:34] Because when you get to heaven, there's
[2:23:37] a great screen that's going to roll
[2:23:39] down. It will show what your life should
[2:23:42] have been
[2:23:45] your life to him.
[2:23:48] So let us look at our lives.
[2:23:51] See what we're holding on to
[2:23:56] will be to
[2:24:01] this might be the last time we ever
[2:24:02] meet.
[2:24:04] Let me say this.
[2:24:06] Preach the message.
[2:24:09] Preach it sky high, heaven high,
[2:24:14] the sin killing religion.
[2:24:17] Compromise.
[2:24:19] Never take the glory for yourself.
[2:24:23] Let us live a life for Jesus Christ.
[2:24:27] Amen.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's coming a time that God
[2:24:32] summons you at the judgment as his
[2:24:34] witness
[2:24:37] and believe the message.
[2:24:42] Let that be me.
[2:24:45] God bless you.
[2:24:48] It's been an honor and a privilege to be
[2:24:50] here.
[2:24:52] God bless you all.
[2:24:56] Amen.
[2:24:57] As our sister sings this song when he
[2:25:00] was on the cross,
[2:25:02] &gt;&gt; there's no one
[2:25:05] among us
[2:25:10] when nothing
[2:25:14] on our own.
[2:25:21] We make mistakes
[2:25:24] and often sleep.
[2:25:31] Just come on flesh
[2:25:34] and born.
[2:25:38] But someday
[2:25:41] I'll prove
[2:25:44] just
[2:25:46] why I say.
[2:25:50] Hallelujah.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; I'm of a special
[2:25:55] kind.
[2:25:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; For while he
[2:26:02] was on the cross.
[2:26:11] I
[2:26:12] was on his mind.
[2:26:19] M
[2:26:23] for
[2:26:25] he knew
[2:26:28] me.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord God.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; Yes
[2:26:38] me.
[2:26:45] He
[2:26:47] whose glory
[2:26:50] makes
[2:26:52] the heavens
[2:26:55] shine.
[2:27:02] I'm so
[2:27:05] unorthy.
[2:27:14] such mercy.
[2:27:23] It's why he
[2:27:26] was on the cross.
[2:27:34] I
[2:27:36] was on his mind.
[2:27:45] The look of love
[2:27:48] was on his face.
[2:27:53] The thorns
[2:27:57] were on his head.
[2:28:04] Blood was on
[2:28:08] his scalpro
[2:28:14] stained in crim.
[2:28:22] And though his eyes
[2:28:24] were on
[2:28:26] the crowd,
[2:28:29] the day
[2:28:33] he looked
[2:28:37] inside.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; Oh yes.
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; So I he
[2:28:44] was on the cross.
[2:28:51] I
[2:28:53] was so
[2:29:03] for
[2:29:06] you.
[2:29:10] You believe in saints?
[2:29:13] Yes.
[2:29:15] You love
[2:29:17] me.
[2:29:25] He
[2:29:27] who glory
[2:29:29] makes
[2:29:31] the heavens
[2:29:34] shine.
[2:29:38] Oh Lord,
[2:29:41] I'm so
[2:29:43] unworthy.
[2:30:02] Yes. When he
[2:30:05] was on the cross.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:13] I
[2:30:14] was his
[2:30:17] m.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Think about those words as you sing.
[2:30:41] Now that
[2:30:46] he

[2:30:52] Heat.
[2:31:02] Heat.
[2:31:14] Heat.
[2:31:23] That's why he
[2:31:26] was
[2:31:28] the

[2:31:42] time.

[2:32:21] Heat. Heat.
[2:32:32] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[2:32:43] Yeah.
[2:33:09] Oh yes.
[2:33:11] You and I
[2:33:14] were on his way.
[2:33:28] Hallelujah.
[2:33:29] Sister, come back here. Come back here,
[2:33:31] sister, for just a moment. Hallelujah. I
[2:33:35] wonder if for just a moment in this
[2:33:36] atmosphere, we can close our eyes for
[2:33:38] just a few moment.
[2:33:42] God is about to do something.
[2:33:45] Hallelujah.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm just excited because it has
[2:33:49] been revealed to me, friend.
[2:33:52] Hallelujah.
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Look, sister, I don't know
[2:33:56] if you do, but I want us to sing Mercy
[2:33:57] Rewrite my life just
[2:34:02] look. I'm excited because Mercy is about
[2:34:05] to rewrite someone's life.
[2:34:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:34:14] Oh, thank you Lord Jesus.
[2:34:30] Mercy

[2:34:36] my life.

[2:35:52] soul,

[2:38:01] Thank you.
[2:38:05] I for
[2:38:18] your mercy reach to me when I was lost.
[2:38:22] Lord Jesus lifted me up, restored me,
[2:38:27] brought me back to my identity. Lord, I
[2:38:30] am standing.
[2:38:41] I fall
[2:38:48] my soul.
[2:38:52] Mercy.
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Mercy.
[2:39:08] Now with every eye closed,
[2:39:11] listen.
[2:39:13] We don't plan it, but this is the most
[2:39:15] important part
[2:39:19] of camp.
[2:39:23] When the word that has been preached
[2:39:28] takes a hold of a soul.
[2:39:32] There are people here with us today
[2:39:36] that are prodigos.
[2:39:40] You had walked away from the Lord.
[2:39:43] You may not even have left church.
[2:39:47] But you you you know you are back.
[2:39:50] You had backsliden.
[2:39:55] You You're no longer having that
[2:39:56] fellowship.
[2:40:00] You had fallen.
[2:40:03] You thought your soul was cast down.
[2:40:07] But you have heard today,
[2:40:10] man of God, reading a scripture,
[2:40:12] for the Lord has chosen fire.
[2:40:15] The Lord has chosen you.
[2:40:18] He has desired you
[2:40:21] for his habitation.
[2:40:25] This is his rest forever.
[2:40:29] You are the rest.
[2:40:33] He wants to rest in you. He wants to
[2:40:36] dwell in you. He has desired
[2:40:41] to have you.
[2:40:46] This is the chosen time.
[2:40:49] This is the chosen moment.
[2:40:55] There's hope for you.
[2:40:58] It doesn't matter
[2:41:02] how far you are gone.
[2:41:05] It doesn't matter how much you have
[2:41:08] done.
[2:41:09] No one might know
[2:41:13] but you at know.
[2:41:15] Satan knows. God knows. But there is
[2:41:19] something that you know that Satan does
[2:41:23] not know
[2:41:24] that you and God know
[2:41:27] that you are going to make your life
[2:41:29] together.
[2:41:31] You are coming back home.
[2:41:35] I don't know how many
[2:41:38] that could be.
[2:41:40] It could be one I don't know.
[2:41:44] But listen,
[2:41:46] this is an invitation for you.
[2:41:52] Maybe you've been forced to come
[2:41:56] and you didn't even want to come to
[2:41:58] come,
[2:42:00] but you were here because you are his
[2:42:03] seat.
[2:42:05] He has desired you.
[2:42:08] You can't fall.
[2:42:10] The world is not your place.
[2:42:13] Denominations are not your place.
[2:42:15] The word is your place. The house of God
[2:42:18] is your place. This is where you dwell.
[2:42:22] God wants to dwell in you.
[2:42:26] Don't walk away from it.
[2:42:29] This is an invitation for you.
[2:42:32] And God is speaking to you.
[2:42:35] Come.
[2:42:36] Let us reason together.
[2:42:40] Would you walk from your seat
[2:42:44] and come?
[2:42:54] There is that thing on your heart moving
[2:42:57] on you
[2:43:00] is a spirit of God
[2:43:04] that just touched you by the preaching
[2:43:06] of the word.
[2:43:10] While everybody's in prayer,
[2:43:14] this is a very important moment.
[2:43:20] Just close your eyes and be in prayer.
[2:43:24] If you're tired of standing, seat,
[2:43:28] but let something be done in
[2:43:34] run for your life.
[2:43:37] There is mercy for you.
[2:43:42] &gt;&gt; All hope is not lost.
[2:44:05] 3.
[2:44:21] Hallelujah.
[2:44:24] Hallelujah.
[2:44:42] The father is pleased
[2:44:45] &gt;&gt; to see you coming back home.
[2:44:50] Must have cried tears of joy.
[2:44:54] to see his boy come back home,
[2:44:57] to see his child come back home.
[2:45:04] God reveals his word in the season.
[2:45:09] To whom he chooses to reveal it,
[2:45:13] God chooses who he reveals it to.
[2:45:17] He chose that before the foundation of
[2:45:19] the world.
[2:45:22] All of his doings are fornown,
[2:45:27] hidden from man.
[2:45:29] He reveals them as he will.
[2:45:33] It is his chosen season.
[2:45:36] It is his chosen person.
[2:45:39] And he never did choose a party or a
[2:45:41] group of people.
[2:45:43] He chooses a person
[2:45:46] to reveal himself to.
[2:45:49] He's choosing you right now. Don't walk
[2:45:52] away.
[2:45:54] Come running back.
[2:45:57] There is mercy for you
[2:46:00] for you. Listen to other voice.
[2:46:04] You are his chosen.
[2:46:10] Doesn't matter what you have done, what
[2:46:12] the devil say.
[2:46:15] Doesn't matter how far you think you've
[2:46:16] gone.
[2:46:18] His
[2:46:20] mercy still remains strong
[2:46:24] is a gracious God.
[2:46:27] An understanding God
[2:46:31] one that is willing
[2:46:33] able to redeem you back
[2:46:37] you back and bring you to a place for
[2:46:41] you to understand
[2:46:43] not your works.
[2:46:45] his works, his righteousness
[2:46:49] that he has given unto you.
[2:46:52] You receive it by faith.
[2:46:55] Faith is based on forgiveness.
[2:46:58] He has forgiven you for your sins. Turn
[2:47:02] back to him
[2:47:05] and he will impute his righteousness on
[2:47:07] you.
[2:47:10] You are the generation
[2:47:13] of the righteous.
[2:47:19] Oh, thank you, Lord.
[2:47:21] If you have a loved one
[2:47:24] that you know has walked away from the
[2:47:26] Lord
[2:47:28] in this atmosphere,
[2:47:30] they can be restored.
[2:47:32] They can be restored. I challenge you to
[2:47:34] pray for them. I challenge you to pray
[2:47:37] for them. They can be restored. Come
[2:47:39] out. Maybe your brother or sister. Maybe
[2:47:42] your father or mother. Maybe your son or
[2:47:44] daughter. I challenge you right now to
[2:47:46] pray for them. They can be restored.
[2:47:49] Believe for it. Believe for it. Speak
[2:47:52] it. So shall it be.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Because God is here. The right
[2:47:56] atmosphere, bad things will happen. The
[2:48:00] right time, the right season.
[2:48:04] Hallelujah.
[2:48:05] Hallelujah.
[2:48:16] My seed
[2:48:20] reaw
[2:48:34] my
[2:48:41] I could
[2:48:43] have fallen
[2:48:46] but my soul
[2:48:49] cast
[2:48:53] but mercy
[2:48:56] rero
[2:48:59] my life.
[2:49:07] My soul says yes.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; Says yes.
[2:49:17] &gt;&gt; Says yes.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; My soul says yes
[2:49:31] to your will.
[2:49:36] Sing it again. My soul,
[2:49:38] &gt;&gt; my soul saves you.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Do you crying to him?
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; Just understand he's here
[2:49:49] to restore you.
[2:49:52] He has done that to very many before
[2:49:55] you
[2:49:57] and he's a faithful God.
[2:50:00] Oh, he is faithful.
[2:50:03] He is faithful.
[2:50:07] &gt;&gt; Sing it again. My soul,
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; my soul says yes.
[2:50:17] &gt;&gt; Says yes.
[2:50:20] &gt;&gt; Oh, says yes.
[2:50:27] &gt;&gt; My soul
[2:50:28] &gt;&gt; My soul says yes.
[2:50:33] Say yes
[2:50:36] to
[2:50:40] &gt;&gt; this is what you should pray. Tell me
[2:50:45] where you lead me.
[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; I will follow
[2:50:53] when you call me.
[2:50:57] I will love you.
[2:51:01] Oh my Lord,
[2:51:05] please
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; teach me to know your way.
[2:51:12] Where you lead me,
[2:51:15] where you lead me,
[2:51:20] I will follow.
[2:51:24] When you call me,
[2:51:28] &gt;&gt; I will answer.
[2:51:31] Oh my.
[2:51:34] Please teach me to know your way.
[2:51:42] &gt;&gt; Listen now.
[2:51:44] &gt;&gt; Tell him,
[2:51:45] &gt;&gt; "Whatever it takes,
[2:51:50] whenever you want,
[2:51:54] One moment you choose,
[2:51:58] whatever your plan,
[2:52:01] oh my Lord,
[2:52:04] let your will
[2:52:06] be done in me.
[2:52:11] &gt;&gt; Sing my soul,
[2:52:12] &gt;&gt; my soul says.
[2:52:16] &gt;&gt; Come on, sing it now if you say yes.
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; Says yeah.
[2:52:22] says yes.
[2:52:28] &gt;&gt; My soul says yes.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Says yes
[2:52:37] &gt;&gt; to your will.
[2:52:44] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[2:52:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[2:52:57] &gt;&gt; Young ladies and young men
[2:53:02] that are here at the altar,
[2:53:05] everyone, please close your eyes.
[2:53:09] God knew you
[2:53:11] before the foundation of
[2:53:16] what you need to do
[2:53:19] is to stop trying to be a Christian.
[2:53:26] Quit trying.
[2:53:29] What you need to start doing
[2:53:31] is to have faith in God.
[2:53:35] If you could do it on your own,
[2:53:38] he didn't have to die on the cross.
[2:53:43] But because you couldn't, he died.
[2:53:47] He became sin that you might become the
[2:53:50] righteous.
[2:53:53] Now the scripture says, Abraham believed
[2:53:57] and was imputed unto him
[2:54:01] for righteousness.
[2:54:03] Now I want you to believe God
[2:54:06] from today. Believe God.
[2:54:09] If you have challenges, believe God.
[2:54:12] If you have temptations,
[2:54:15] if you have trials, believe him.
[2:54:17] Whatever it is, keep believing him and
[2:54:21] walking with him. He will lead you
[2:54:23] through. He give you an experience and
[2:54:27] he will lead you through.
[2:54:29] Give yourself to the world. Don't give
[2:54:32] yourself to attending fellowship.
[2:54:36] Don't miss services.
[2:54:38] Go to church whenever church is open.
[2:54:40] Stand the word. And I tell you what, he
[2:54:43] will lead you through. You don't have to
[2:54:46] worry about anything. All you have to
[2:54:50] worry is if you don't believe,
[2:54:54] just believe
[2:54:57] because he has done everything.
[2:55:00] All that is left for us
[2:55:03] is to accept
[2:55:06] sacrifice.
[2:55:10] You see, it's that simple.
[2:55:15] When the prodigal son came back to the
[2:55:19] father didn't begin to tell him about
[2:55:21] what he did,
[2:55:24] that was insignificant.
[2:55:27] The boy was still a son of his father.
[2:55:32] He just had lost the relationship.
[2:55:36] So you have lost the relationship with
[2:55:38] God.
[2:55:40] And because of the preaching of the word
[2:55:43] today, I assure you without doubt, my
[2:55:48] relationship, the fact that you are here
[2:55:52] has been restored
[2:55:54] and you're going to walk away.
[2:55:57] You go back to your church. You go back
[2:55:59] to your pastor and give them the the
[2:56:02] testimony of what the Lord has done.
[2:56:05] Now, let me pray together with you. A
[2:56:08] prayer of thanksgiving,
[2:56:10] loving Jesus. You're a mighty God.
[2:56:13] You're a holy God. I believe you're
[2:56:16] still filled with the Holy Ghost. These
[2:56:18] young people need an experience.
[2:56:21] Meet them, Lord Jesus, at the point of
[2:56:24] their need. fill their hearts. I pray
[2:56:27] Lord let them come to a place of full
[2:56:30] realization
[2:56:32] that you change to empower you convict
[2:56:36] because you have convicted them to come
[2:56:38] here Lord. It means there is faith in
[2:56:40] their heart to receive your word to
[2:56:43] believe what you have said and now Lord
[2:56:45] that relationship had been lost. I want
[2:56:49] to thank you Lord because you came
[2:56:51] because of them. We have had this come
[2:56:54] because of them
[2:56:57] and they're not going to be the same.
[2:57:01] For you have done a great work in their
[2:57:04] life. We just say blessed be your name.
[2:57:09] Thank you Lord Jesus. We commit each one
[2:57:12] of them at your hands. The young ladies
[2:57:14] and the young men, the little ones Lord,
[2:57:18] the older ones as well. You know them by
[2:57:20] name.

[2:57:25] thank you for the work you have done in
[2:57:27] blessed be your holy name. In the name
[2:57:30] of our Lord.

[2:57:50] I want all of us to stand
[2:57:52] and actually we are going to begin the
[2:57:54] last service right now.
[2:57:57] I know brother shalom was supposed to
[2:57:59] take that shalom. Where's brother Enoch?
[2:58:04] Is he still in come? I hope brother
[2:58:06] Shalom has been taking many
[2:58:10] coming around the end. Let us stand and
[2:58:13] sing. Therefore now there's no
[2:58:15] connection.
[2:58:18] Amen.

[2:58:35] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. Show. Tell Goliath is dead.
[2:58:39] &gt;&gt; Come on young people. I can't hear you.
[2:58:42] Tell your neighbor Goliath is dead.
[2:58:46] &gt;&gt; You know what we are going to do?
[2:58:48] We are going to usher in another
[2:58:50] preacher
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; to now come and cut his head off.
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; Well, we must rejoice about that.
[2:59:02] Thank you, brother Michael. Thank you,
[2:59:04] brother Joshua. Thank you, brother K.
[2:59:06] Thank you, brother. Goliath is dead.
[2:59:11] Amen.
[2:59:14] Brother Joshua, that was a masterpiece.
[2:59:19] Let us give the Lord a great great
[2:59:22] praise.
[2:59:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; It has been wonderful,
[2:59:30] having you at our campus.
[2:59:34] Thank you for coming.
[2:59:36] Now, next time you come, perhaps
[2:59:39] I'll buy your air ticket.
[2:59:43] Listen,
[2:59:45] the only thing
[2:59:47] I've not allowed these brothers to do
[2:59:50] is to spend money out of their pocket.
[2:59:55] But what I have allowed them to do is to
[2:59:58] buy their air tickets.
[3:00:00] I couldn't afford it.
[3:00:04] But let me tell you something.
[3:00:07] I could do what I can do
[3:00:11] now. And there is something we can do. I
[3:00:14] want deacons to come.
[3:00:16] You I did what I could,
[3:00:20] but you can help me to
[3:00:23] right dig into our pockets
[3:00:27] and you do what you can do.
[3:00:31] Don't just give, you know, 1,000
[3:00:34] shillings.
[3:00:37] No.
[3:00:38] Make sure what you are giving is an a
[3:00:42] love offering.
[3:00:45] Take it from your heart. You do what you
[3:00:48] can do. Is that a man? Well, let me tell
[3:00:52] you, if there is something we can learn,
[3:00:57] one preacher came from New York
[3:00:58] recently,
[3:01:01] brother Simon Peter. Simon Peter, very
[3:01:04] wonderful minister. And he preached
[3:01:05] something to our church.
[3:01:07] He said this
[3:01:08] &gt;&gt; salvation is free.
[3:01:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:14] &gt;&gt; But blessings
[3:01:17] are conditional.
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; Give it shall be given.
[3:01:24] Right? So if you want a blessing, if you
[3:01:27] want to be given, if you want a
[3:01:29] blessing, give right. That's what
[3:01:33] believers believe.
[3:01:36] So brother brother uh the brother will
[3:01:37] do that if the deacons can help with
[3:01:39] that. And this is not a force. This is
[3:01:42] not comfy. This is a love offering.
[3:01:47] &gt;&gt; Which song was that?
[3:01:50] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now listen, I know there are
[3:01:52] special songs that this is that. But at
[3:01:54] at 610 we are inviting the preacher. So
[3:01:59] if you want to go out before the
[3:02:01] preacher comes in to quickly ease
[3:02:03] yourself, you come back 610. But but the
[3:02:05] service song service is beginning right
[3:02:07] now. Mobile money. Well, those who uh
[3:02:10] need to send on mobile money, can you
[3:02:12] please
[3:02:15] can you flash the merchant cards?
[3:02:19] For those who want to send offerings, if
[3:02:21] you don't have cash,
[3:02:24] I was just told there are those who want
[3:02:26] to send
[3:02:29] &gt;&gt; please send uh those um uh things
[3:02:34] on the screen.
[3:02:36] &gt;&gt; Can I get it in a moment?
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; You have it please. Brother Ivan quickly
[3:02:43] therefore now
[3:02:46] condemnation.
