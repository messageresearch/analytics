[56:44] Christ amen amen
[56:47] [Music]
[56:49] amen I would like to invite you to the
[56:53] scriptures First Corinthians 11
[57:09] [Music]
[57:14] verse1 we are reading only one
[57:23] verse
[57:37] what does it say
[57:41] there English it says be ye followers of
[57:44] me even as I also am of
[57:52] Christ amen
[57:55] amen you may be
[57:57] seated so I greet to you all in the name
[58:00] of Jesus Christ once
[58:04] again amen amen so we are happy to be in
[58:08] the house of the Lord
[58:10] this I've also been asked to speak to
[58:13] evening light bright
[58:18] Tabernacle Tabernacle so we greet the
[58:22] Saints uh on Zoom this evening
[58:28] last
[58:30] Wednesday I preached on pointing people
[58:32] to
[58:36] Christ and so today I will talk about
[58:39] the same maybe it can be a part two of
[58:41] what I spoke
[58:45] about many people contacted me and they
[58:48] said they were really blessed by that
[58:52] service and actually one one believer
[58:55] told me do you have a part two of
[59:00] that I realized I might have a few parts
[59:03] of this same
[59:08] thought so uh let us be in
[59:12] prayer believing that the Lord will
[59:14] minister to
[59:17] us
[59:18] amen pointing people to
[59:22] Christ be ye followers of me even as I
[59:25] also am of
[59:29] Christ you notice uh speaking of this we
[59:32] need to understand that the world that
[59:34] we are living in
[59:38] currently is a world that is looking for
[59:43] followers when I say world I mean the
[59:46] people you see everyone is looking for
[59:50] followers uh hospitals are looking for
[59:53] followers
[59:55] when you go there they register you they
[59:56] want you to keep
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:00] coming and so when you go back it will
[1:00:03] not be a
[1:00:05] hustle so you are a
[1:00:07] follower when you go to
[1:00:10] churches churches also look for
[1:00:13] followers and uh it has it has come to a
[1:00:16] point whereby churches or denominations
[1:00:19] begin to burst uh according to how many
[1:00:22] followers are following their Church
[1:00:29] and if we were to say that the church
[1:00:31] that has the biggest following is the
[1:00:33] right
[1:00:37] church that would be the Roman Catholic
[1:00:41] church because the Roman Catholic church
[1:00:43] has the biggest following in the
[1:00:47] world how many knew that it has the
[1:00:50] biggest
[1:00:52] following but I hate to disappoint you
[1:00:56] but it's not about how big the following
[1:00:59] you
[1:01:02] have many times if you have a big
[1:01:08] following actually spiritually
[1:01:10] speaking a big following is a sign that
[1:01:13] there is something
[1:01:15] [Music]
[1:01:17] wrong you know when Jesus Christ was
[1:01:19] still on
[1:01:21] Earth he had a big Following also at one
[1:01:24] time
[1:01:26] time we see he started as a small
[1:01:30] Church really with only a handful of
[1:01:33] Believers and then later on the people
[1:01:38] multiplied into uh
[1:01:41] thousands because as they kept on
[1:01:43] hearing the test the testimonies out of
[1:01:45] his
[1:01:47] ministry they would hear that the man
[1:01:49] was raising the
[1:01:51] dead they would hear he would you know
[1:01:53] give uh you know you know
[1:01:56] Miracles he would heal the sick he would
[1:01:59] Open the Eyes of the Blind and as they
[1:02:01] kept on hearing these
[1:02:03] testimonies they were touched and they
[1:02:06] were pulled towards the ministry of
[1:02:08] Jesus
[1:02:10] Christ and so at one time he had 5,000
[1:02:13] in his
[1:02:16] church and so it was a big
[1:02:19] church what today we call a mega
[1:02:22] church and so
[1:02:24] Pastor
[1:02:26] Jesus came up one day and you know the
[1:02:30] people were
[1:02:31] hungry and you know Pastor Jesus had to
[1:02:34] bring a
[1:02:36] solution you know this is a miracle
[1:02:38] worker this is a promis
[1:02:41] keeper and so when he was standing right
[1:02:43] before
[1:02:44] them and they told him that the people
[1:02:47] are
[1:02:48] hungry he they looked at him and kept
[1:02:51] quiet they waited for a solution
[1:02:55] and he told them what do you have he
[1:02:59] took what they had and he multiplied it
[1:03:02] and they had many bread and they had
[1:03:05] many fish and every one of them every
[1:03:09] last one
[1:03:11] ate every last one
[1:03:14] ate and they even had a remainder of
[1:03:16] some fish and some
[1:03:20] bread and they collected a bunch of
[1:03:23] baskets
[1:03:25] and people were happy said our pastor is
[1:03:28] the pastor our pastor is the best they
[1:03:32] said our pastor there is no one like him
[1:03:35] our pastor he is the top
[1:03:39] notch his
[1:03:40] sermons do wonders in our
[1:03:43] life he only spoke and bread was
[1:03:47] multiplied let me ask you Church who
[1:03:50] among you would not want to be under the
[1:03:52] ministry of such a man
[1:03:56] he you come and tell him Pastor I have
[1:03:58] no
[1:03:59] rent he says receive your
[1:04:02] rent and money just is created in your
[1:04:06] says I have no food and food is just
[1:04:08] created by a
[1:04:10] miracle that is the nature of Jesus's
[1:04:14] Ministry and people loved him people
[1:04:18] increased actually we say he had
[1:04:22] 5,000 but it was more than 5,000
[1:04:25] because 5,000 were only
[1:04:28] men so if you count women and and
[1:04:32] children she had about maybe
[1:04:35] 15,000 or maybe
[1:04:38] 25,000 because usually women and
[1:04:39] children are more than
[1:04:42] men so he was a pastor of a mega
[1:04:46] church but then he brought uh another
[1:04:52] Revelation this is what pushed away the
[1:04:56] people he now did not preach a message
[1:04:58] of
[1:05:00] Miracles he did not preach a message of
[1:05:02] signs and
[1:05:04] wonders but now his sermon
[1:05:06] was the word he says he that cannot eat
[1:05:11] my
[1:05:12] flesh and drink my
[1:05:15] blood is not a part of
[1:05:18] me and they looked at him they said is
[1:05:21] this man a
[1:05:23] vampire
[1:05:24] how come he can tell us to eat
[1:05:27] him and drink his
[1:05:30] blood we cannot do that God forbid one
[1:05:34] by one they walked away one by one they
[1:05:37] walked away the church which had tens of
[1:05:41] thousands of
[1:05:43] people remained with only about 12
[1:05:47] people 1 2 3 4 5
[1:05:51] 12 and they looked at Jesus
[1:05:55] and he looked at them he did not say
[1:05:57] please remain with me please stay but he
[1:06:00] looked at them and he said do you also
[1:06:03] want to
[1:06:04] go meaning his message was not that
[1:06:07] which was pulling people towards
[1:06:12] himself but yet he is the only man in
[1:06:17] this earth who had a Ministry that was
[1:06:21] worthy pulling people towards him
[1:06:25] but today we have every preacher every
[1:06:29] man behind a bu his minist is pulling
[1:06:32] people towards
[1:06:35] him that is a clear sign of a false
[1:06:40] prophet a true prophet of God will not
[1:06:44] pull people towards
[1:06:46] himself he will pull people towards
[1:06:49] God towards the word because God is the
[1:06:53] word
[1:06:55] his word can never
[1:06:57] lie his word is the truth his word is
[1:07:02] final praise the name of the
[1:07:06] Lord while I'm continuing here you have
[1:07:08] to clear my sound I'm hearing a lot of
[1:07:11] uh you need to make it a bit better
[1:07:15] praise the name of the
[1:07:16] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and
[1:07:20] Jesus preached a very hard someone that
[1:07:23] day
[1:07:27] let me remove
[1:07:29] my to he
[1:07:32] preached hallelujah hallelujah tell your
[1:07:35] neighbor don't be so
[1:07:38] gloomy tell him be happy
[1:07:42] smile Hallelujah if you want the Lord to
[1:07:45] speak to
[1:07:46] you amen be ready to
[1:07:48] receive how many are ready to receive
[1:07:51] this ready to receive
[1:07:54] praise the name of the Lord and so we
[1:07:56] see that Jesus preached a very hard some
[1:07:59] on that
[1:08:00] day and the people left him but he was
[1:08:04] not pulling the
[1:08:07] remainder he instead told them to go
[1:08:10] away but those who stayed they told
[1:08:13] him he says to whom can we
[1:08:16] go who has the words of eternal
[1:08:19] life why did they stay they did not stay
[1:08:23] because was a good
[1:08:25] man they did not stay because he looked
[1:08:28] so
[1:08:29] nice they did not stay because he did
[1:08:31] miracles for
[1:08:33] them they did not stay because he had a
[1:08:35] big
[1:08:37] church but they stayed they stayed
[1:08:41] because of the
[1:08:42] word amen we are here because of the
[1:08:46] word We are following him because of the
[1:08:50] word amen Brothers uh please help on the
[1:08:54] sound is becoming worse now praise the
[1:08:56] name of the Lord there's quite a lot of
[1:08:58] stereo or maybe I'll not preach until
[1:09:00] you Brothers brother Dixon I I don't
[1:09:02] know why you always have to be
[1:09:06] told you will have to excuse us
[1:09:10] friends well I think that is becoming
[1:09:13] better when it is good I'll tell
[1:09:16] you praise the name of the
[1:09:19] Lord hallelujah
[1:09:22] hallelujah
[1:09:26] and so I think that is good now that is
[1:09:29] good now I think we can go with that so
[1:09:32] he
[1:09:33] says be ye followers of me even as even
[1:09:37] as I also am of
[1:09:42] Christ and I want you to think
[1:09:45] about the
[1:09:48] scenario when these people
[1:09:51] leave and they are only left with Jesus
[1:09:54] is left with only a
[1:09:56] handful and he does not beg them to
[1:09:59] stay but
[1:10:01] today when you have a church of 10
[1:10:05] people 20 people 30 50 you don't feel
[1:10:10] very
[1:10:12] satisfied because you feel maybe what
[1:10:15] you're preaching is not the
[1:10:17] truth the truth will not draw
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:21] crowds the truth will draw only those
[1:10:23] that were predestinated to
[1:10:26] [Music]
[1:10:28] life and any God called man will preach
[1:10:33] the truth regardless of how many people
[1:10:35] he is preaching
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:38] to and when he preaches it he will
[1:10:40] preach his
[1:10:42] heart I always say he will preach like a
[1:10:45] dying man to a dying
[1:10:49] generation because we are not preaching
[1:10:51] to bring followers to us
[1:10:55] we are not
[1:10:57] comedians we don't come to make you know
[1:10:59] to make you happy so you can follow
[1:11:02] us we don't come you know to give you
[1:11:05] things so you can follow us you know we
[1:11:09] come to tell you
[1:11:11] something which will prepare you for the
[1:11:13] coming of the
[1:11:15] Lord because Jesus is coming and he is
[1:11:18] the one we love he's the one we worship
[1:11:20] he's the one we
[1:11:22] follow
[1:11:25] you know let me tell you in this world
[1:11:27] today there is a church which is not
[1:11:31] amen leading people towards that
[1:11:35] denomination it is not leading people
[1:11:37] towards a
[1:11:38] man it is not leading people towards a
[1:11:42] system but it is leading people towards
[1:11:45] a living God it is leading people
[1:11:49] towards Jesus
[1:11:51] Christ I believe I'm part of that church
[1:11:54] I believe I'm a member of that
[1:11:57] church and the bishop of that church is
[1:12:00] Jesus Christ himself the one that died
[1:12:04] and aen rose
[1:12:06] again and I want you to hear this from
[1:12:10] the message
[1:12:12] Elijah when you see these drunks and
[1:12:18] prostitutes on the street don't Point
[1:12:21] your scornful finger and say
[1:12:26] I'm better than they
[1:12:30] are I'm requesting you brother Dixon to
[1:12:32] sit there brother Prince sit this side
[1:12:34] and make sure brother Dixon that the
[1:12:35] sound is perfect amen when you see these
[1:12:38] drunks and prostitutes on the street
[1:12:41] don't Point your scornful finger and say
[1:12:43] I'm better than they
[1:12:45] [Music]
[1:12:50] are how many saw a drunkard this past
[1:12:56] week brother how did you feel about the
[1:13:05] drunken it was
[1:13:07] nasty it is really nasty this is really
[1:13:11] mess I'll tell you 90% of Believers feel
[1:13:15] that
[1:13:18] way but our Prophet here tells
[1:13:21] us when you see these drunks and
[1:13:26] on the
[1:13:27] streets don't Point your scone full
[1:13:30] finger and say I'm better than they
[1:13:35] are the thing to
[1:13:37] do that person is just as low as they
[1:13:40] can get
[1:13:44] now if
[1:13:46] anything is as low as he can
[1:13:50] get if anything take them by the hand
[1:13:53] and lift them
[1:13:57] up and point them to Jesus Christ the
[1:14:01] son of God who can save
[1:14:03] them but oh I belong to the churches we
[1:14:06] don't have such people like that in our
[1:14:11] churches we've we've drawn a boundary
[1:14:14] line
[1:14:15] now we just let a certain class of
[1:14:18] people come to our
[1:14:22] churches what we need today is that old
[1:14:25] fashioned Holy Ghost
[1:14:29] Revival a nationwide which makes us all
[1:14:32] shake hands with one another and call
[1:14:34] one another brother and
[1:14:39] sister are you hearing what I'm saying
[1:14:42] Church the problem we
[1:14:44] have the problem that we have that many
[1:14:48] people you know draw a boundary
[1:14:51] line they say oh that one is a drunker
[1:14:55] oh that one is like this or that one is
[1:14:57] doing his hair like that or that one is
[1:14:59] doing this and that for us in our
[1:15:03] church we are better than all of them so
[1:15:07] in other words they kind of feel in
[1:15:09] their Church they the only ones going to
[1:15:13] heaven in their Church they are the only
[1:15:16] right ones let me tell you that is how
[1:15:20] denomination
[1:15:22] started
[1:15:24] and we are not members of any
[1:15:27] denomination Believers of the message of
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] hour they are not followers of any
[1:15:34] denomination we are followers of
[1:15:37] Christ we are not followers of
[1:15:40] denomination amen there is a message in
[1:15:43] the
[1:15:43] L it is called the end time
[1:15:47] message it is not any religion it is
[1:15:51] beyond
[1:15:52] religion Beyond Church it is beyond
[1:15:56] Fellowship it is a
[1:15:58] connection with Jesus
[1:16:01] Christ amen and we are a part of it
[1:16:05] here we don't want to draw a boundary
[1:16:10] line we want we don't want to have a
[1:16:12] certain class of people come to our
[1:16:14] [Music]
[1:16:17] churches we need everybody to

[1:16:44] power of the Holy Ghost and they will no
[1:16:47] longer be what they used to
[1:16:49] be some of those were
[1:16:52] us some of those were
[1:16:55] you but now we have been washed but now
[1:16:59] we have been
[1:17:00] Sanctified now we have been filled with
[1:17:02] the Holy Ghost we are now on our way to
[1:17:06] heaven some of you are not there
[1:17:09] yet but I tell you you are going to get
[1:17:11] there as long as you stay under the pure
[1:17:15] word as long as the pure word is
[1:17:18] preached there is nothing that can take
[1:17:21] that Revival out
[1:17:25] you must be filled with the Holy
[1:17:27] Spirit tell your neighbor you must be
[1:17:29] filled with the Holy
[1:17:31] Spirit you must be born
[1:17:33] again as long as the the true word is
[1:17:36] being preached to
[1:17:39] you praise the name of the
[1:17:41] Lord
[1:17:43] Hebrews Ser he
[1:17:45] says now the little
[1:17:49] Tabernacle he was talking about his
[1:17:51] Tabernacle in
[1:17:54] has no
[1:17:56] membership but we have
[1:17:59] fellowship and I want to say this every
[1:18:03] true
[1:18:04] church has no
[1:18:06] membership but has
[1:18:10] Fellowship you see what is
[1:18:12] membership is when they tell you you
[1:18:16] know we own you some of them even in the
[1:18:19] dominations they bring a
[1:18:21] book where they tell you to
[1:18:23] sign your name as a member subscribe as
[1:18:26] a member whereby if you
[1:18:31] left it will be as if you're going to
[1:18:35] hell but in the message we have been set
[1:18:40] free in the message we don't do it like
[1:18:44] in the
[1:18:45] denominations we don't believe in church
[1:18:49] membership but we believe in
[1:18:55] Fellowship we have no Creed but
[1:18:58] Christ we have no law but
[1:19:02] love come on say it with me we have no
[1:19:05] book but the
[1:19:08] Bible That's the only book that we
[1:19:12] know and the only thing that we
[1:19:15] know as we have as the blood of Jesus
[1:19:20] Christ cleanses us from all
[1:19:23] s we have Fellowship one with
[1:19:27] another while the blood you know when we
[1:19:30] come in the fellowship and the word is
[1:19:33] preached the blood begins to take to
[1:19:37] cleanse to cleanse you to Cle you to
[1:19:41] cleans you and as you are being
[1:19:44] clean as you are being cleaned then we
[1:19:47] can have
[1:19:49] Fellowship what is the basis of
[1:19:51] Fellowship
[1:19:55] the basis of
[1:19:56] Fellowship is the blood of
[1:19:59] Jesus the basis of Fellowship is the
[1:20:03] true word of God being
[1:20:05] preached if any church does not stand
[1:20:09] with the true word of
[1:20:11] God I have no Bas of fellowship with
[1:20:15] them if they Don't Preach one
[1:20:18] God and they preach three gods of the
[1:20:22] trinity
[1:20:23] that is not a Bible
[1:20:25] Doctrine it was brought and added by the
[1:20:28] Roman Catholic
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:31] church and that is why I cannot
[1:20:34] Fellowship in the Roman Catholic
[1:20:38] church because I have no basis of
[1:20:42] Fellowship my basis of
[1:20:44] Fellowship is with those that believe in
[1:20:47] one
[1:20:49] God in the one God of
[1:20:51] Abraham the one God of Isaac in the one
[1:20:55] God of the
[1:20:56] Bible amen my best of
[1:20:59] Fellowship is with those amen that
[1:21:02] believe in the baptism of the Holy
[1:21:06] Spirit after
[1:21:09] believing my Bas of Fellowship is with
[1:21:12] those that believe we have a message the
[1:21:17] eny that has restored us back to the
[1:21:19] faith of the pente

[1:21:25] membership we have
[1:21:27] Fellowship tell your neighbor we have no
[1:21:29] membership but

[1:22:47] religion not in my
[1:22:49] denomination come on sisters in my
[1:22:53] church not with my pastor but I can

[1:23:15] one and has many
[1:23:17] members and all the members of that one
[1:23:21] body being
[1:23:23] many are one
[1:23:25] body so also is
[1:23:29] Christ for by one
[1:23:32] Spirit we are all
[1:23:35] baptized into the one
[1:23:40] body whether we be Jews or
[1:23:44] Gentiles whether we be born or
[1:23:48] free
[1:23:51] we we
[1:23:54] whether we be English or
[1:23:57] African amen we have been
[1:24:00] baptized into one
[1:24:03] body by one spirit and we have all been
[1:24:07] made to
[1:24:08] drink into one Spirit the more we hear
[1:24:12] the word of God the more we are drinking
[1:24:15] into the
[1:24:16] spirit and the Bible says here amen that
[1:24:20] we have many members
[1:24:23] but the body is
[1:24:24] one tell your neighbor the body is
[1:24:27] one but the members of the body are
[1:24:31] many now all the members of that one
[1:24:36] body being
[1:24:38] many yet it is one
[1:24:41] body and he says by one
[1:24:44] Spirit are we all
[1:24:47] baptized into that
[1:24:50] body how many bodies
[1:24:53] one
[1:24:54] body now if anybody is going to go in
[1:24:56] the
[1:24:58] Rapture he must be a member of that
[1:25:02] body we don't have two bodies of the
[1:25:06] Lord there can only be one
[1:25:09] body I want you to think about it
[1:25:12] friends amen before this message
[1:25:15] came we have had many
[1:25:18] religions we had
[1:25:20] anglicans which I was part of Catholics
[1:25:26] Adventists you know
[1:25:27] morons you know and all the others
[1:25:31] Pentecostals and each
[1:25:34] group was claiming to be that
[1:25:37] body the Catholics were saying we are
[1:25:39] the universal Body of
[1:25:43] Christ and anyone who is not a member of
[1:25:45] the Catholic
[1:25:47] church is not part of the
[1:25:50] body and they were saying we are the
[1:25:52] body
[1:25:53] the anglicans came
[1:25:55] later they said no you are wrong we are
[1:25:58] the body and and the Pentecostals came
[1:26:01] and the Baptist came and Presbyterians
[1:26:04] and each of them was claiming to be that
[1:26:08] body we are the body but here when when
[1:26:13] God inen in the end
[1:26:16] time restored the
[1:26:19] Church back again to the foundations of
[1:26:21] the truth
[1:26:24] told them none of them is the
[1:26:27] body because those are
[1:26:30] systems listen those are
[1:26:34] organizations those are
[1:26:36] denominations are you hearing me there
[1:26:39] is no religion going to
[1:26:41] Heaven There is no denomination going to
[1:26:44] heaven but let me tell you souls are
[1:26:48] going to
[1:26:49] heaven people are going to heaven
[1:26:52] only those who are a part of that
[1:26:56] body and he says how do you become a
[1:26:59] part of the
[1:27:01] body you become a part of the
[1:27:04] body by being born into the
[1:27:08] body listen you do not join the
[1:27:12] body by writing your name on a church
[1:27:15] book you don't join the body by shaking
[1:27:19] a pastor's
[1:27:21] hand don't join the body by attending
[1:27:25] Fellowship
[1:27:26] somewhere but you become a
[1:27:28] member of the body of Jesus Christ by
[1:27:33] being filled with the Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost and how do you be filled with the
[1:27:37] Holy
[1:27:38] Ghost chapter
[1:27:41] two chapter 2 he says repent every one
[1:27:44] of
[1:27:45] you and be
[1:27:47] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for
[1:27:51] the remission of your sin
[1:27:53] and he shall I
[1:27:56] know and he shall I
[1:28:00] know where Where is the scripture
[1:28:02] brother and he shall be
[1:28:06] filled tell your neighbor and he shall
[1:28:08] be
[1:28:09] F you shall be
[1:28:11] F how you can't be
[1:28:14] filled by being a member of a certain
[1:28:17] Church you can't be filled by going to
[1:28:20] some organization you can only be filled
[1:28:24] amen by being amen by by receiving Jesus
[1:28:28] Christ through
[1:28:30] repentance after belief of the
[1:28:33] truth and you baptized in much
[1:28:37] water in the name of Jesus
[1:28:41] Christ there is no other
[1:28:44] name whereby we can be saved but the
[1:28:47] name of Jesus
[1:28:49] Christ amen is the only name
[1:28:52] I said there is no other name but only
[1:28:56] Jesus that's the only name thereby we
[1:29:00] can be
[1:29:01] saved and once you have believed on that
[1:29:05] name and you baptized in much
[1:29:08] water then God looks at you because you
[1:29:12] have faith he accepts you and as a proof
[1:29:17] he has
[1:29:18] accepted he fills you with the Holy
[1:29:20] Spirit
[1:29:22] when you receive the Holy Spirit you are
[1:29:25] now a member of the
[1:29:27] body so who are the members of the body
[1:29:31] of Jesus
[1:29:32] Christ they will believe in all that
[1:29:36] where are they going to come from they
[1:29:38] will come from all
[1:29:39] denominations they will come from
[1:29:41] Anglican they will come from Catholic
[1:29:43] they will come from Pentecostal they
[1:29:45] will come from Baptist they will come
[1:29:47] Froman they will come from
[1:29:49] everywhere and they are going to come
[1:29:51] from Every Nation on
[1:29:54] Earth what I'm teaching today is
[1:29:57] something
[1:29:58] foundational I want you to listen to me
[1:30:00] with all your
[1:30:01] heart you see they're going to come from
[1:30:04] everywhere we should never we especially
[1:30:07] as Believers of this
[1:30:09] message we should never
[1:30:13] think that our little
[1:30:16] church is the only church that has the
[1:30:20] truth
[1:30:23] that is
[1:30:26] foolishness we would have become
[1:30:30] denomination the body of
[1:30:32] Jesus is a large
[1:30:35] body it is all over the
[1:30:37] world you see these names we name
[1:30:41] ourselves dvf blah blah blah blah blah
[1:30:44] blah blah it's just like the Catholics
[1:30:46] also Nam themselves Roman Catholic
[1:30:48] Anglican Presbyterian no
[1:30:50] differ
[1:30:53] no difference it's just
[1:30:56] names that is used for the
[1:31:00] government those are not even
[1:31:02] ours we do not identify ourself by dvf
[1:31:06] or by evening
[1:31:09] light that is just a registration for
[1:31:11] the government to identify
[1:31:14] us but how do we identify
[1:31:18] ourselves we identify
[1:31:20] ourselves as part of the
[1:31:24] body if we are filled with the Holy
[1:31:27] Ghost if we are filled with the Holy
[1:31:29] Ghost if we believe the
[1:31:32] truth then we know we are members of the
[1:31:36] body we cannot know we members as a
[1:31:40] group we have to know as
[1:31:44] individuals many of you can come here
[1:31:48] and you still go to
[1:31:49] hell if you're not filled with the Holy
[1:31:52] Ghost so it's not about where you go for
[1:31:56] church you can even go where the truth
[1:31:58] is
[1:32:00] preached and you miss it but if you
[1:32:03] receive it and you filled with the Holy
[1:32:06] Ghost then you are sealed as a
[1:32:09] member and when the trumpet of God shall
[1:32:12] sound amen you will be among
[1:32:15] those that you will go in the Rapture
[1:32:19] the Bible says your body shall be
[1:32:20] changed
[1:32:22] morality shall put on
[1:32:25] immortality and then you will fly
[1:32:28] away but I tell you what you can easily
[1:32:32] miss
[1:32:33] it and the body of
[1:32:36] Jesus is one body but with many
[1:32:40] members the moment you are filled with
[1:32:42] the Holy
[1:32:43] Ghost you are a
[1:32:47] member and how many members do we have
[1:32:49] in this
[1:32:50] church
[1:32:52] I am a member if you don't know whether
[1:32:54] you a member or
[1:32:57] not amen I tell you what every service
[1:33:00] you come to be sure you are a
[1:33:03] member because if you are not a member
[1:33:06] you will not go in
[1:33:09] the sometimes when you preach against
[1:33:11] what some denominations do and what some
[1:33:13] Churches
[1:33:16] preach people get
[1:33:19] offended how can you speak against my
[1:33:21] church
[1:33:23] my Bishop my denomination they love
[1:33:26] their
[1:33:27] denomination more than they love
[1:33:29] themselves because if you loved
[1:33:32] yourself you would surely love the word
[1:33:34] of
[1:33:35] God but people love their pastors their
[1:33:38] churches their
[1:33:40] denominations more than they love the
[1:33:42] word of
[1:33:43] God it is only in the message of the
[1:33:47] hour amen that God has said come out
[1:33:50] of

[1:39:27] Ephesus we
[1:39:29] Brothers Believers together members of
[1:39:32] one body no division in the
[1:39:36] body the time religion did not believe
[1:39:39] in men being Bishops over
[1:39:43] others in a way that they control other
[1:39:46] pastors the old time religion believed
[1:39:49] in every Church
[1:39:52] meaning local
[1:39:53] Fellowship being
[1:39:56] independent being
[1:39:59] Sovereign but their
[1:40:02] sovereignty was only under the
[1:40:05] word and the Holy Spirit so all the
[1:40:09] fellowships wherever they were they were
[1:40:13] preaching nothing out of the
[1:40:17] word they would only preach the word oh
[1:40:21] we are going back to our
[1:40:23] ABS we need to know our ABS we need to
[1:40:26] know what we stand
[1:40:28] for your amen should be better than that
[1:40:33] one
[1:40:35] Hallelujah there is only one
[1:40:38] body we become a part of it by a
[1:40:41] spiritual
[1:40:44] birth he says where we are born or free
[1:40:46] whether we are you know Jews or
[1:40:49] gentiles
[1:40:52] and you
[1:40:53] find in our generation you find a lot of
[1:40:58] issues a lot of problems listen to
[1:41:00] me
[1:41:02] people dividing
[1:41:05] themselves so this one is a church
[1:41:11] of this this one is a church
[1:41:16] of this one is for us we
[1:41:19] are for us
[1:41:22] we only here no no no this one is
[1:41:29] only no no this one is for children of
[1:41:33] nambi are you hearing me that's not the
[1:41:36] old time
[1:41:38] religion we were part of those
[1:41:43] tribes we were part of those but when we
[1:41:46] came to the
[1:41:49] Lord we were changed changed and we were
[1:41:52] made members of one
[1:41:54] body so once you are filled with the
[1:41:56] Holy Spirit you are part of
[1:41:59] it God does not have
[1:42:02] grandchildren he only has Sons and
[1:42:05] Daughters children are usually born by
[1:42:08] un experience not joining the
[1:42:14] family so we don't believe in this kind
[1:42:16] of thing that I I joined so I'm a member
[1:42:19] also no we don't we don't accept
[1:42:22] that you must be
[1:42:25] born into this family and this family
[1:42:27] you born into itat by an
[1:42:30] experience you are not born into it by
[1:42:32] shaking the pastor's
[1:42:34] hand you
[1:42:36] are you are not being born into it by
[1:42:38] being a a family member
[1:42:42] somewhere it doesn't matter whether you
[1:42:45] your father is the
[1:42:47] pastor are you hearing me it doesn't
[1:42:49] matter whether your uncle is the
[1:42:51] pastor it doesn't matter whether your
[1:42:54] father in-law whether your brother
[1:42:55] in-law you I don't
[1:42:58] care that doesn't make you
[1:43:00] member you must be born
[1:43:03] again by the same same experience that
[1:43:06] the first Believers
[1:43:08] have like on the day of
[1:43:11] Pentecost you must receive an experience
[1:43:14] you must meet God you must be changed
[1:43:18] amen the fire of the Holy Ghost must me
[1:43:21] your
[1:43:22] soul or else you are not a
[1:43:26] member you see and if you're not a
[1:43:30] member you are not going to the
[1:43:34] rapture we don't have things like you
[1:43:37] know me I was born like for me I was
[1:43:40] born in the Anglican
[1:43:43] Church what is your religion I am
[1:43:47] Anglican why because my father was Ang
[1:43:51] and his father was
[1:43:53] angry now today what do we have what's
[1:43:56] your religion I'm a message
[1:43:58] believer oh how when did you believe no
[1:44:03] I was born a
[1:44:04] Believer you hear many of them say like
[1:44:06] that I was born a
[1:44:09] believer One one of them told me oh I
[1:44:12] was a Believer even when I was in my
[1:44:13] mother's
[1:44:14] wom that's a lie of the
[1:44:17] devil you cannot believe in your
[1:44:19] mother's home you believe after
[1:44:22] hearing the gospel and accepting it so
[1:44:26] whether your father is a pastor or
[1:44:28] not or whether it's the arch Deacon or
[1:44:30] the
[1:44:31] bishop you have to have an
[1:44:34] experience that every member has
[1:44:37] heart you cannot say I'm a Believer by
[1:44:40] proxy or I'm a Believer by
[1:44:44] extension God does not have
[1:44:48] grandchildren God has children only Sons
[1:44:51] and
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:53] Daughters tell your neighbor God has
[1:44:55] only Sons and
[1:44:59] Daughters no
[1:45:02] grandchildren we are all children of
[1:45:05] God I've even never had any someone
[1:45:09] inspired I am a grandchild of
[1:45:12] [Music]
[1:45:14] God now we say I am a child of
[1:45:19] God
[1:45:21] that's why everyone must have that
[1:45:24] experience praise
[1:45:26] God 1 Corinthians
[1:45:28] 12 for the body is not one member but
[1:45:33] many verse 14 verse 15 now if the food
[1:45:36] shall
[1:45:39] say because I am not the
[1:45:41] hand I am not of the body is it there a
[1:45:45] for not of the
[1:45:46] body and if the ear shall say because I
[1:45:49] am not the eye
[1:45:51] I am not of the body is it therefore not
[1:45:53] of the body if the whole body were un
[1:45:57] ey where were the
[1:46:00] hearing if the all were hearing where
[1:46:04] were the
[1:46:08] smelling but now God has set the members
[1:46:12] every one of them in the
[1:46:15] body as it has pleased
[1:46:18] him and if they were all one
[1:46:21] M where we the where we the
[1:46:24] body but now are we but now are they
[1:46:28] many
[1:46:30] members yet but one
[1:46:33] body so listen friends I want you to
[1:46:35] listen
[1:46:36] carefully we cannot say that the only
[1:46:40] dvf
[1:46:42] family is the
[1:46:46] body anybody else that does not
[1:46:48] interpret things the way we interpret
[1:46:50] them is going to
[1:46:53] hell we cannot say
[1:46:56] that why we are only a member of the
[1:47:02] body and and even in the in the local
[1:47:06] Fellowship we have many
[1:47:10] members and every member is a member of
[1:47:13] the
[1:47:15] body and then you go from fellowship to
[1:47:19] Fellowship and every
[1:47:21] Fellowship is a member of the body is a
[1:47:24] member of the body but he has said now
[1:47:27] in the body there are also
[1:47:31] gifts and now we cannot be able to say
[1:47:34] that now one
[1:47:36] Fellowship is now the whole
[1:47:39] body no we can't say
[1:47:41] that there are different
[1:47:44] parts of the
[1:47:48] body praise God
[1:47:50] the church is the
[1:47:52] body the local
[1:47:54] church The Universal Church it begins
[1:47:58] with an
[1:47:59] individual you you are the church tell
[1:48:02] your neighbor you are the
[1:48:04] church now you are the church from you
[1:48:08] individual to a local body
[1:48:11] Fellowship from a now we are the body
[1:48:14] also meaning we are the church but now
[1:48:18] from us comes the UN
[1:48:24] all over the world they are scattered
[1:48:27] even here Ina there are many fellowships
[1:48:29] here and
[1:48:30] there right now I'm speaking only to
[1:48:33] days of the voice and then evening light
[1:48:35] but these are only two
[1:48:37] B two members of the
[1:48:40] body but then we have many other
[1:48:43] members and each Ministry is
[1:48:47] important each Fellowship is important
[1:48:51] because each Fellowship is a
[1:48:54] member and we need one another because
[1:48:57] we are only one little piece of the
[1:49:02] body you have seen here when we make
[1:49:05] meetings you know we need very many from
[1:49:07] other
[1:49:10] fellowships when they make meetings they
[1:49:12] they invite some of our
[1:49:15] people so some of you musicians you can
[1:49:18] never be able to say me only play for
[1:49:20] our
[1:49:21] church you don't even know what you're
[1:49:23] talking about your church is not only
[1:49:26] this
[1:49:27] one this is a fellowship of the
[1:49:30] church the church is
[1:49:32] big huh brother where is brother Prince
[1:49:35] you can I cannot tell you brother please
[1:49:37] song
[1:49:38] today no no me I only song in
[1:49:42] gu for my past who told you if you are a
[1:49:47] song leader in the body you a song leer
[1:49:49] in the home whole body of
[1:49:52] Christ if you Aon same
[1:49:55] thing if you are a m if you are doing
[1:49:58] media Department whever there is a
[1:50:00] meeting and you're invited you are part
[1:50:02] of that
[1:50:03] [Music]
[1:50:05] body we don't we should never have
[1:50:08] attitudes that is not our church this
[1:50:10] one is our church that is not our church
[1:50:12] those are bad
[1:50:14] attitudes there are for people who do
[1:50:16] not know who we
[1:50:19] are for me and my
[1:50:21] house as for me and my house we know one
[1:50:25] thing we are part of the
[1:50:27] body and we are not the only body but
[1:50:31] the body of Christ is
[1:50:34] universal the bride is comprised of the
[1:50:37] whole
[1:50:39] body not just a
[1:50:41] piece therefore there is no room for a p
[1:50:46] to feel as if they were the only
[1:50:49] body
[1:50:51] we are all part of one
[1:50:55] another praise God one time I was
[1:50:58] speaking to someone some years
[1:51:00] ago and he told me my pastor is the best
[1:51:03] pastor in the
[1:51:05] world I hope some of you don't feel
[1:51:08] that the only best person in the world
[1:51:11] is Jesus
[1:51:13] Christ all of us are just
[1:51:17] sent we are preachers of the Gospel
[1:51:20] and no one higher than the other and
[1:51:23] everyone has a peculiar
[1:51:25] gift and every gift is
[1:51:28] different and every gift is needed and
[1:51:32] every gift is
[1:51:33] important you cannot say this one now is
[1:51:35] better than the other one this one is
[1:51:38] better than the other one it's all right
[1:51:39] to appreciate your pastor but never
[1:51:42] appreciate your pastor over Jesus
[1:51:46] Christ because if your pastor is a man
[1:51:49] of God
[1:51:51] he's pointing it to
[1:51:52] Christ he's not pointing it to himself
[1:51:56] he's not pointing it to his Fellowship
[1:51:58] is pointing you to Christ and that's why
[1:52:01] I believe the enti message because this
[1:52:04] message did not point me to William BR
[1:52:08] did not point me to a church this
[1:52:11] message pointed me to
[1:52:13] Christ I now know Christ in a way I have
[1:52:16] never known
[1:52:18] him
[1:52:20] because of this
[1:52:22] message praise God I have a few more
[1:52:25] minutes listen no
[1:52:28] competition if you know you are a part
[1:52:30] of the
[1:52:31] body there won't be
[1:52:33] competition for
[1:52:38] importance some people have even noticed
[1:52:40] them
[1:52:41] sometimes in many
[1:52:44] churches some people when they realize
[1:52:46] that they have been used a
[1:52:48] lot
[1:52:50] or that they needed a
[1:52:52] lot or that they think they know
[1:52:55] something better than others and they
[1:52:58] not respect they feel they not respected
[1:53:01] enough they will walk away let me see
[1:53:05] now how they do
[1:53:08] without anybody whoever does that is
[1:53:11] because they don't know how it
[1:53:13] works just a
[1:53:18] little
[1:53:20] needed but you're not the only one that
[1:53:22] is
[1:53:23] needed everyone is needed you may not
[1:53:27] even be a minister preacher you may just
[1:53:29] be a church
[1:53:31] member sister Grace you come and sit
[1:53:33] there let me tell you by sitting there
[1:53:36] you are ministering to
[1:53:38] others we as a body need
[1:53:41] you there is no little one and big one
[1:53:44] and small one we are all
[1:53:47] important we are all needed we are all
[1:53:51] necessary so we all part of the
[1:53:54] body praise
[1:53:56] God and the eye We are continuing in 1
[1:53:59] Corinthians 12:21 and the I cannot say
[1:54:02] unto the
[1:54:04] hand I have no need of
[1:54:08] thee nor again the head to the
[1:54:12] feet I have no need of
[1:54:16] you much more those members of the body
[1:54:19] which seem to be more feeble and
[1:54:27] necessary are you hearing me whatever if
[1:54:30] you feel you are a little piece of the
[1:54:34] body you
[1:54:37] need just like
[1:54:39] fellowships whether a church or we call
[1:54:42] them a church but they
[1:54:44] fellowships where Fellowship has 10
[1:54:48] members
[1:54:51] or they in some Village somewhere they
[1:54:53] are
[1:54:55] needed here days of the voice we are
[1:54:59] needed some evening light you are
[1:55:02] needed someone told me one time why
[1:55:05] don't we remove all the other churches
[1:55:07] if we one
[1:55:09] body and we make one big
[1:55:12] one and we bring one man and make him
[1:55:16] our leader that's a denomination of
[1:55:18] spirit
[1:55:20] God does not work like
[1:55:22] that if if so why didn't he make the
[1:55:25] whole body one
[1:55:28] eye why did he make the whole body one
[1:55:31] hand and you see one hand
