Lord are you under expectation amen wonderful to be in dvf tonight and just to have a word of edification as we get into prayer as we turn to our Bibles our pastor has already prayed and uh I bring greetings from Kenya I hope you receive them yeah I came with so many greetings I think we shall pass some of them on Sunday and uh like to salute my family back home I know they're streaming the service and uh I believe you're going to have a blessed time in the book of 2 Kings chapter 6 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 13-1 17 a very common and familiar scripture that we all know and I'm just trusting God to get something to speak on as he leads us by his grace 2 Kings chapter 6 verse 13-1 17 and this is what the Bible says trusting that we are all there and he said go and spy where he is that I may send and fetch him and it was told him saying behold he's in Dothan therefore sent he Thee the horses and chariots and a great host and they came by night and compassed the city about and when the servant of the man of God was risen early and gone forth behold and host Compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do and he said and he answered fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and elishah prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see and the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw and behold the mountain was full Hallelujah it was not quarter it was not halfway but it was full of horses and Chariots of Fire round about Elisha father in the mighty name of Jesus Christ you've read your word Lord we believe this to be your word Lord that proceeded out of your mouth and Lord here we are as little eaglets Lord and expectation that Lord Jesus Christ you will feed us your word tonight that Heavenly Father even as we go into prayer we shall rise in the Realms of the heavenlies oh God into that place where the impossible becomes possible father we pray that Lord you may St our faith tonight the Lord you shall edify us oh God you shall Quicken Lord Jesus Christ the faith of God in us that Lord Jesus Christ each and every one of us even as we go into prayer we shall be able father to have access even into the holy of holies like Esther heavenly father have that identification oh God that the scepter of the King has been extended unto us oh God and now we can approach you father we thank you and we appreciate you Lord by the ministration of your word we pray that Lord you shall make these things a reality and Lord Jesus Christ like the servant of this Prophet that we've just read about may you open our eyes to to see the Lord Jesus Christ on our side tonight for this is our prayer and we ask it in Jesus mighty name amen amen amen you may have your seats uh as I invite your attention to the book of Isaiah chapter 59: 19 to 20 and then we shall also read first John chapter 4:4 praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now I really want to ensure that I utilize and make uh maximum use of my time and tonight I'll be speaking about uh in the form of asking a question I want to ask you what do you see when you look praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ what do you see when you look praise the name of the Lord Jesus when I say it is off praise the Lord amen now I want to speak about what do you you see when you look praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want to draw a distinction between looking and seeing praise the name of our Lord Jesus you can look at something and fail to see praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you can have I remember uh back in school there's this story book that we used to have and there was H someone that that had a pen I don't know if someone has a pen uh maybe someone has a pen quickly just just pass it to me kindly someone has a pen and it's plugged in right there in their ear and they're asking all around the place where's my pen where is my pen they're looking for the pen Hallelujah where is my pen where is my pen they're looking for it praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but they cannot see that they have the pen I'll be saying quite a lot so let's get used to it praise the Lord so have you ever been in a situation where you're looking for something and you're not seeing it but in real sense that thing is with you I know sometime this happen to mothers you can be looking for a spoon maybe you want to Star a pot or something like that and you're wondering where did I put that spoon why did I put that wooden stick and all that where else it's all been in your hand the whole time praise the name of the Lord Jesus so I want to show you having eyes does not mean that you see you can look at something and fail to see it assuming this room as we are in right now and all the lights are out your eyes can be open but in reality you're looking but you can't see praise God why can't you see simply because you have nothing that can enable you to see praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and I just want to draw a few illustrations here from the story that we've read about Elisha and his servant and the Bible is so clear to tell us that Elisha prayed to God and and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray thee open his eyes that he may see the servant had his eyes open so and it is the opening of his eyes that made him realize that actually we've been encompassed round about so this man it's not that he had his eyes closed this man was not blind his eyes were actually working quite well his eyes were open but the problem is the opening of his eyes were only showing him that the enemies were round about him praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and it takes the prophet of the Lord to pray once again that Lord open his eyes that he may see so there's something else that had been hidden from the vision of this servant that when the prophet of God prayed this servant was now able to see amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus and I want to ask you as we continue when you look what do you see because each and every time you look at something there has to be something that you see praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ maybe you've been looking at your life and seeing problems maybe you've been looking at your life and seeing issues you've been looking at your life and seeing unanswered prayers you've been looking at your life and seeing as if God has been delaying praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ but now I pray to God that tonight I can pray the same prayer that Elisha prayed Lord may you open their eyes that they may see say because there's something else there's something else that you need to see Hallelujah it is not that what you're seeing is wrong as a matter of fact what you are seeing is actually true but there's another Vision that you need to open your eyes to see praise God I see Jonah one time having received a call from God and he runs away and we know the story and he's swallowed by a fish B when he opened his eyes to look what did he see on this side where El better on this side west belly right left and Center North South East and West all that he could see was nothing but W's belly Hallelujah now what I'm talking about is not ignorance I'm not trying to say that we become ignorant of what is happening no sir we are not becoming ignorant we are actually acknowledging that yes The Well of the the belly of the wh is right here I'm right in darkness I'm right in my problem I'm right in my situation but I want to see beyond the belly of the whale I want to see beyond my sickness I want to see beyond this circumstance I want to see beyond the problem what do I want to see the promise of God praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and Jonah was able to remember something that there's a Temple somewhere Hallelujah and as he was remembering his vision started changing Hallelujah the belly of the whale started fading this side started fading and a vision was being created and it was the vision of the temple Hallelujah and now you see as the vision of the temple is being created there are certain words that were coming to his mind oh my that is what we need Saints amen remember habakuk chapter 2 write down the vision at the appointed time the vision shall speak Hallelujah so he started hearing certain words what was it it was the prayer of Solomon that oh God if there be a child of thine regardless of the situation woo regardless of the circumstance if they pray to you oh God looking towards this Holy Temple oh God may you hear and you know what happened John has he wred in now as he was looking yes the belly of the H was there but he could see beyond the belly of the wh praise the name of the Lord Jesus and that is what I want to speak on tonight what do you see when you look look at your situation look at your life life look at your walk with God look at your family look at your business look at your job what do you see when you look Isaiah 59: 19- 20 says this so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the Sun and when the enemy shall come in like a flood the spirit of the Lord shall shall Rift up a standard against him what do you see when you look the enemy coming like a flood yes I can see that but brother sister let me ask you look again what do you see when you look the Bible tells me that the spirit of God shall raise a standard are you in a situation where you look round about your life all you can see is the devil all you can see is the flood I want you to look I want you to look once again because the promise of God stands sure that the spirit of God shall raise up a standard and he says this and the spirit of God shall lift up a standard against him verse 20 says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion how is a spirit going to be able to raise a standard by the Redeemer coming into Zion Hallelujah let's go to 1 John 4:4 1 John 4:4 this is what the Bible says ye are of God little children and have overcome them he's talking about having victory over the world and the things of the world and all those kind of things and he says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world you believe this thing Saints all right let's start preaching now what do you see when you look brother Bram tells us in several messages that the Gate of the soul is the eyes praise God many times during the prayer line he will tell the people people to ensure that they've closed their eyes and not look up until brother Bram will tell them that it's okay to look up praise God and he says he somewhere and each one of you you're looking your eye is the gate to your soul you can look at it it almost governs the other senses you look at it before you taste it you look at it before you smell it you look at it before you feel it and so forth it is usually the eye that is the gate to the soul and he says this and if you could only let that be a blessing to you when you see with your own eyes and you hear with your own ears the Lord Jesus moving among the people and doing things that he has been doing it should make you have real Faith then praise God you see brother branam is getting us to a place where we know these things that we have the body we have the spirit and we have the soul we know that the body has five inlets inlets rather has five senses we know the spirit has five as well and in the soul there's only one thing that can be able to stay there either Faith or doubt praise God and it tells us and these are things that we know that the things that happen in the outward have a certain impact and an influence and what is on the inside praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Christ so we get to a place where we get to understand that it matters the things that we look at really matter it matters what we are watching Praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it matters the things that we see with our own eyes Brothers if all you keep on seeing in the office time and time again is half naked women you know what's going to happen sisters if all you keep on seeing time and time again office or at school women or your friends are as cantly dressed you know what's going to happen all these kind of things they rub off on you amen praise the name of the Lord Jesus no wonder brother Bram preached a message influence are we following are we sleepy all right so what we look at what we see with our own eyes matters a lot if you spent too much much time looking at M and is it called UTV and you nbtv or something the the television stations of the country you'll be influenced you'll be influenced by the order of the day because whatever it is that you're watching and seeing how this is happening here how this is happening here it influences your thinking praise the name of the Lord Jesus that is why in Philippians the Bible tells us if there be any praise if there be any VT you if there be any of these things think on these things because the things that you expose yourself to they influence what saturates your mind as a young person if all that you do from morning to evening till late in the night is WhatsApp and movies and social media and Tik toks and all these kind of things it influences the way you think it influences the way you see the Bible it influences the attitude that you have when you come to to the service praise the name of the Lord Jesus we can never really overemphasize on those things but it really matters the things that we look at and you see we get to a place where we need to realize that as an individual the way we are tuned as human beings with our physical eyes there's nothing good that we can be able to see praise God I'll tell you a story one time that brother Bram gave about this little boy boy he went to the mother and told the mother you know uh we've heard so much about God we always read about God during the family altar in Sunday school we sing songs about God I would really want to see this God how can I see God and the mother told the young boy you know what son that's a very hard question why don't you ask it to the Sunday school teacher that Sunday first thing goes to the Sunday school teacher Sunday school teachers you have a lot of of work because if the parents do not know the questions are going to come to you and then the Sunday school teacher says unfortunately I also do not know the the answer to that question so why don't you go ask the pastor so the little boy as faithful as he is as innocent as he is he goes to the pastor pastor this God that we keep on hearing time and time again you've preached about him service after service maybe even today you also mentioned about this God how can I see is God and then the pastor tells the young boy young man unfortunately nobody can be able to see God and this didn't really settle so well in the young boy's mind because it's like if this God is able to create the Earth the moon the stars the Sun and all these kind of things everything that we see the trees the animals he even created me how is it that he cannot be seen I hope you understand the the the insiration of this young boy and then one time as they had gone fishing with a little old fisherman and there was a rainbow that appeared somewhere I'll try to paraphrase the story and he the the the the young man asked the fisherman that question and the fisherman turned to the young boy with tears in his eyes and told him young boy all I've been seeing my entire life has been nothing but God hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus he says when I look at the rainbow I see God when I look at the ocean I see God when I look at the birds I see God and brother Bram says the thing that happened with this old fisherman was simply because he had more of God in him until he could be able to see God on the outside praise the name of the Lord Jesus and that is a place where we really make a mistake many of times we don't have more of of God on the inside and you expect to see God on the outside Young Brother young sister it doesn't work that way if you want to see God on the outside you need to have God on the inside so that the God on the inside can be able to look at things using your eyes remember what brother Brenham says he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he has no mouth but your mouth he has no eyes but your eyes praise God and you know one thing about God if God is using your eyes the only thing that God is going to see is just one thing he's going to see his word praise the name of the Lord Jesus we have a message God has not changed his mind about his word praise the name of the Lord Jesus and you know that this word is the only thing that is going to stand the test of time Heaven and Earth will pass away praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but the word of God will remain I want to ask your a question brother sister are you a part of that word yes sir Hallelujah we might be so quick to say that heaven and earth will pass away but do you know that scripture also applies to you because you are a part of that word so sickness will pass away sorrow will pass away Peril will pass away but I will remain why I am a part of that word but how can you be able to see these things if God is looking at these things from in us we miss out a lot of things simply because when we look we do not see praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but I want to thank God for something here because you see in this last age there is something that was connected between sight and the ludian churches praise the name of the Lord Jesus Revelation 3:1 17-18 says this because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked yeah for sure we have some the naked part they've really fulfilled it so well in the spiritual and in the physical but in the physical in terms of blindness not so much isn't that true I mean how many are there in churches today but are not physically blind but they're spiritually blind right but you see the Bible identifies that those in the ludian church age are going to be blind and he continues to say Verse 18 I canel Thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou may be rich and white rment that thou may be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyes s that thou mayest see hallelujah praise God so the promise for this last Church age is that there shall people that will receive eyes myself when others are walking in blindness there are some that will receive their sight Hallelujah why are we receiving our sight let me ask that why are we receiving our sight you see we are receiving our sight simply because God and the way God does things remember we want to see God right amen and the only way we can see God Is by having him on the inside so if our eyesight needs to be corrected so that we can have God on the inside then God also needs to work on the inside and that's the reason why God was very very particular in that in this last Church age he sent us a messenger to the heart praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Malachi 4: 5 and six this is a messenger that is there to deal with the heart specifically and he shall turn the heart of the children back to the fathers so why is it that there's a messenger who is dealing with the heart Matthew chapter 5:8 Matthew 5:8 we see one of the things that happened when Jesus came in the first coming they missed him so much in that Jesus was standing right before them but when they looked at Jesus they were seeing the son of a carpenter they were seeing just a young boy who's unrule in the society praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that was born out of wedlock but this was the Messiah so what was the problem the problem was John the Baptist came with a message to their heart but their heart was not turned but to them that their hearts were turned Hallelujah when Jesus came and John the Baptist said Behold the Lamb of God because their heart was turned when they turned they saw Jesus praise the name of the Lord Jesus Matthew 5:8 blessed are the pure in heart for I want you to say H for they shall do what blessed are the pure in heart so that's why God had to send a messenger to the heart to deal with your heart to deal with my heart to condition us and put us in a place where you and I shall see God hallelujah remember we are not being ignorant we are not being oblivious of challenges we are not being oblivious of problems we are not being oblivious of situations that will arise no sir yes we understand all these things are there but at the end of the day I want to see something beyond my problems I want to see something beyond my issues I want to see something beyond my failures I want to see something beyond all these things what do I want to see I want to see Jesus praise the name of our Lord Jesus Christ so remember now we want to get him on the inside right and brother Bram says something here gives an analogy this is the message looking at the Unseen and says paragraph 62 says here and when you people here tonight that is sinful in your heart I don't mean that you live in adultery I don't mean that you get drunk I mean sin is unbelief and with unbelief in your heart if you just open up your heart once again he's dealing with the heart so the issue is with the heart if you just open up your heart and close your eyes and look at the chief Captain who's only presentent tonight the world will lay at your feet and it will shake every F of sin away from you and the doubting days will be over oh blessed be the name of the Lord and he says this I'm told that a snake can catch the Earth eye of a bir and charm that bir with its enchantment it eyes until such a way if that bir will give the snake its attention for just a few minutes that bird will flatter and completely become paralyzed Hallelujah and the snake will take the B so let's pause right there then I can ask another question again what are you giving your attention to because what you're giving your attention to blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus is charming you praise the name of the Lord Jesus and you see all this is a trap and he says and I can believe that because that I know of another serent the devil that if he can ever catch the eye with his enchantments with your modern rock and roll and all your fangles of the world if he can ever catch you young lady or young man just long enough to get his charm in on you you will flatter but you can't get loose this is the reason why we cannot be able to press through even in prayer you get to a place you're supposed to pray for 1 hour you pray for 2 3 minutes you your prayers are already over you start listening to your neighbor's prayer why because your attention is elsewhere you've given yourself to something else praise the name of the Lord Jesus but we need to get to a place where you should be pushing the pastors and the trustees so that you can get your own permanent place because you do not want to come off the altar you get to a place youve only prayed for 5 minutes the neighbor you the person you're seated next to you start saying Amen to their prayer your attention is because he stands staring but if he will take his eyes from the serpent you know let me tell you something Sint our Prophet was inspired he did not say if he takes his eyes from the SA and look sideways woo he says and look upward why are you looking upward because you're looking away to Jesus David said I look up to the heavens where does my help come from my help come from the Lord and maybe there could be something that you might have gotten yourself entangled into in the course of the week or since the year started and he says but if he will take his eyes from the serpent but if you will take your eyes off of that thing and look upward and flatter his wings he will fly Plum out of the reach of the snake praise the name of the Lord Jesus and if you ever got the charm of the world and the things of the world and unbelief Charming around your heart that tells you oh live more than oh live like this you can live like your friends it's okay you can live like your you know you can live like your buddies that's the Charming voice of the serent shake your head tonight and look up to the Unseen one the Lord Jesus Christ and flatter your wings of prayer I believe that is why we here to flatter our wings of prayer you remember the story of the little iglet as he was stretching his his little wings remember this Eagle canot flown for such a long time and remember when you stay without exercising yourself in prayer the muscles cramp up when you fail to exercise yourself in the spiritual walk your spiritual muscles get cramped up praise the name of the Lord Jesus but why do we come to services such as this one so that we can flat our wings in prayer so that like eagles you can stretch this wing you can stretch this wing and by faith as you're looking up oh my how does brother Branham say it that what happens when the storm comes Hallelujah are you facing storms in your life are you facing problems in your life that does not deter the ego from flying Hallelujah it actually acts as an opportunity because the ego knows I was made for this I was made for this brother sister that is why the Bible tells us that you should rejoice when you're going through trials and temptations it is simply because my amen we've got to prove we've got to prove right we've got to prove that we came from God and are going back to God we've got to prove that we've got the blood of our father us who's ever done a blood test here there's a reason why it is called a blood test and after the test you get results in this walk of Faith you must also go through a test so that you can prove that your blood is that of God and after the test you get results and the results that you get Faith of his faith virtue of his virtue knowledge of his knowledge Temperance of his Temperance all the way praise God since this is a time it's not time to Slumber but it's time to rise on the wings of Faith regardless of the challenge regardless of the trial regardless of the storm it is time for you now to stretch your wing the Old Testament the New Testament and tell God I am taking you at your word hallelujah and you see when that storm comes all that ego needs to do is just let lose its wings and there's a song that says set your wings to The Winds of Faith amen hallelujah Saints this is a walk of Faith this site that we talking about about we could have read it by because of time allow me to paraphrase it is a walk of Faith why because the just shall live by faith we do not walk by sight but we walk by faith because it's only faith that overcomes the world praise the name of the Lord Jesus it is time to arise brother it is time to arise sister Stretch Your Wings of Faith take God at his word and tell the tonight whatever Mountain that is standing before me God I come to you in faith I look beyond the mountain I look beyond the river I look Beyond the Sea why got any rivers you think are uncrossable got any mountains you can't turnel through God Specializes in things not [Applause] impossible what do you see when you look tonight what do you see brother you've been going around through your problem you've been going round through that circumstance you've been going around through that situation you've been here time and time again praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe as sure as the word of God is through if you'll shout all the other voices out and come to this Altar and cry to the Lord God will fill you tonight oh yes Lord but times you looking you're looking at that brother what is the pastor going to say about me or or or you want something spectacular you want something spectacular so that the pastor can see and so that the pastor can know that actually I was filled with the Holy Ghost it's not going to happen I actually want to see so that sister so and so can actually see that I was actually fil it is not going to happen it's time to change your focus now it's time to change your vision now it is time to mean business praise the name of the Lord Jesus this is a life and death a fair brother and if you mean it with God tonight you will leave this place with your answer tonight oh praise the name of the Lord Jesus and he say shake your head tonight and look up to the Unseen the Lord Jesus and flatter your wings of prayer until you fly plum out of his reach and out of his crutches praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ oh my if the devil can be able to get a hold of someone long enough and be able to paralyze them how much more do you think God can do for you if God could just get a hold of you long enough Hallelujah if God could just get a hold of you long enough brother don't you think he can be able to remove the worldliness out of you don't you think he can be able to fill you with his power don't you think he can be able to give you perfect Faith don't you think he can be able to give you perfect love don't you think he can be able to give you they deserve your heart oh praise the name of the Lord Jesus and he says this remember this time that Peter Jesus was working on on water this time and they saw him from the boat and they were getting afraid and Jesus spoke unto them the same words that we saw Elisha speaking here fear not be Not Afraid in his eye and then Peter tells the Lord that if it is you let me come on the water and Peter stepped on the water and he came out of the sheep and stepped on the water and for quite some time he's able to walk well but then says in Matthew 14:29 and he said come and when Peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to Jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous when he came out of the ship he was looking at Jesus when he came out of the ship his eyes were on Jesus but somewhere along the way he saw what was happening on the other side he saw that the winds were so strong you'd guard your eyes on that promise for so long you'd had your eyes on a certain scripture for so long and you praying that God May fulfill it in your life but there came a point in time and you looked at this side and maybe you looked at that side you stopped looking at the promise of God this is what happened to Peter and he said he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying Lord save me one thing I love about Peter is when he looked away and he started sinking he realized something and I can imagine maybe his mind went back a couple of months ago when they were somewhere on a ship and they were all about to sink and the storms were so much and they had tried everything that they could you know they were professional fishermen trying to get the water out of the boat all their life skills and uh how they called maybe they they had been trained uh to to to to survive on the sea during the storm and all those things and they had done all that they could but suddenly they remembered Jesus is on the ship and maybe at this time Peter happened to remember you see right now I'm sinking and I've looked away and maybe I can try and struggle and see if I can swim but he happen to remember all my toiling is in vain all my labor is in vain why all I need to do is call unto Jesus give me a man give me a woman that has had experience that when they call on Jesus Jesus always comes give me a sister that one time the child was sick maybe the husband was not there or maybe the husband was fast asleep and they called on Jesus Oh myall and Jesus answered the prayer give me a brother give me a young man that faced a certain situation there was nobody around there was no Deacon to watch but they called on Jesus and Jesus came regardless of whatever happened Jesus is always there but many of times we toil we struggle we try to do this we try to do this without realizing all that we need to do is awaken Jesus hallu praise God praise God and you see this is what the message is doing for our Saints it's opening our eyes so that we can be able to see that Jesus is right here with us praise the name of the Lord Jesus that that same Angel of the Lord that was with Moses and came to Joshua and told Joshua as I was with Moses so shall I be as I was with brother Bram so am I with you here tonight if only you can see brother if only you can see sister he is here what is the purpose of brother brandham coming it was to declare that he is here that's right yes sir but you see many times we fail to realize that he's here we end up struggling we end up toiling we end up coming to a prayer service as this and we feel that it's just a formality brother sister go beyond that formality prayer go beyond that Casual Friday evening service kind of prayer setup and me it with God tonight because God is right here to meet with your need hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus and here they are Jesus had died he had resurrected as the scriptures had foretold and the Bible tells us I believe it should be somewhere in Luke this was cleopas and his friends Luke chapter 24 and the Bible says this and it came to pass that while they communed together and reasoned Jesus himself oh that scripture is not up there Luke 24:15 and it came to pass that while they commune together and reason the Bible says Jesus himself Drew near not another Jesus but Jesus himself and he says this but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him if you continue reading somewhere down there they even say that one of them responded to Jesus asking Jesus where are you the only Stranger in Jerusalem but who is this who is this Jesus himself see this these little broken words that you're hearing tonight do you know who it is Jesus himself praise the name of the Lord Jesus but you see we get to a place where and as the Bible says Their Eyes Were Holden that they may not see him but then the scriptures continue to tell us they got to this place they got to the house and Jesus broke the bread amen hallelujah and the Bible says that when he broke the bread their eyes were opened and they knew him I want to ask you something do you know how it is that they knew him it's not that Jesus snapped his fingers no sir Jesus did something that they had seen him doing beforeall says this is what we need to get to be a people that have experiences with God in a certain situation in a prayer service such as this you can be seated as you're seated and you can feel something in your body some or rather something in your spirit and you'll say the presence of the Lord is right here with me right and this is going Beyond motion now this is going to a specific way that God deals with you as an individual praise the name of the Lord Jesus because remember they had been with Jesus before he was crucified and the way Jesus broke bread at that time they knew so when they met with Jesus and oh my Hallelujah we sing this song that uh you know uh God came in uh God condescended in flesh I can't remember the the the lyrics of the song but I know some of you know it and there's a place that says and the bride herself takes the word itself and reveals herself in the Bible right but at this particular place the word himself took the word and revealed himself in the very scriptures hallelujah praise the name of the Lord Jesus the word himself taking the word itself and revealing himself in itself because the Bible says he went back to the prophets he went back to Moses and spoke to them what they have spoken concerning him what was Jesus doing he was giving them the word so that they can be able to identify who Jesus is walk with me now we get to another place where we see Fe Philip Hallelujah writing together with that Ethiopian unoch and the Ethiopian unoch is reading the Bible Hallelujah and the Ethiopian un asks of whom speaketh the prophetes of himself or another praise the name of the Lord Jesus so the man didn't know but the Bible says that philli a man full of the Holy Ghost open his mouth and right there preach Jesus Christ praise the name of the Lord Jesus but now we getting to a place where we want to look in the Bible and see Jesus but we see the only way we can see Jesus is if Jesus is on the inside of us because if Jesus is not on the inside of us we will not be able to identify him let me give this quot as we get ready to stand up on our feet in prayer and he says this and tonight uh what was that yes this is it we're in a battle right in the message the should be the greatest battle ever fought says this the brains of the army lays in in its captains right the intelligence ROM in Germany was a brains of Germany not Hitler roml that's right Eisenhower military men PN those men who are at the front it depend on which way they gave the order you follow your captain if he's the right kind of a general if he's a right kind if he's a foster General if he's proved if he's proven to be right follow him I want us to go somewhere now just walk with With Me Slowly though it may seem wrong to you go on to the front do as he told you Hallelujah we've got a five star general spelled j s u s blessing five stars on us F AI t h and he's never lost a battle Hallelujah he conquered death hell and the grave get the Devils out of the the way he's the great Chief captain now I want you to catch these words very carefully so that devil isn't even in the picture hallu amen so if you're looking and all you can see is the devil since you know sometimes we praise the devil without knowing all that we keep on saying oh devil why did you do this to me oh why did you do this to me why is it just me of all the brothers in dvf of all the why just me you're praising the devil without knowing it says this the greatest battle ever raged is setting right ready now suddenly it is oh Hallelujah when I think of it uh yes when I think of it when I stood and watch him do things see him reveal things open up things say it will be this way and that way there it is oh look look back here and say who is this great captain Oh I don't look back and see if it is do so and so so brother branam does not attribute this to a certain great man I see what the captain said he is the captain of our Salvation hallelujah what is salvation Deliverance Glory he's the captain of our deliverance amen the great hour of charge is at hand amen hallelujah Soldiers with armors gleaming Hallelujah colors Streaming Faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this Tabernacle well this evening doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers yes soldiers stand at your post of Duty hallelujah our captain the the Morning Star lead on he never goes back he never he doesn't know the word Retreat Hallelujah he doesn't have no Retreats amen certainly the greatest battle ever fought she is going right on in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt hallu between Liberty and bondage the battle is on Shine Your Spears Soldier polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready God anoints his army and he says America dresses their soldiers in the best that they can have to dress with steel helmets and armors and whatever they got armor tongues whatever they go in and God dresses his army hallelujah what kind of equipment do we use the spirit of the sword oh my Hallelujah you have the helmet of salvation you have the breastplate of righteousness you have the sword of the spirit glory to God the word of God is sharper than a two-edged sword God hallelujah we sing that song that I went to the enemy's camp and I took praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how are we taking because the word is sharper oh enemy I warn you tonight any sickness I am the Lord that Health all your diseases any sin I am the Lord that forgiveth all all your iniquities my oh this is good piercing even to their sound of the bone even the marrow of the bone even a design of the thoughts of the Mind the word of God am Hallelujah to believe uh to believe his word and that's the way God arms let's go up that's what he gave Eve to arm herself with and she broke her armor down how did she do it by opening up her mind to reason you see how the devil come Saints he came to Jesus the same way he came to Eve he came to Eve and told Eve if you know the reason why you were told not to eat this fruit is because God knows you will become like him but you know something Eve could have just given a very simple answer but Mr serpent I am already like God the devil does something and you need to understand this he plants a seed of doubt he wants you to doubt who you are and that is why he came to Jesus and said if you are the Son of God but Jesus does not have anything to do to prove to the devil and the bride tonight has nothing to prove to the devil amen if if you are the bride you will be doing this if you are the bride devil I'm already the bride it's not about what you're going to tell me it is what about he has already told me and according to what he's already told me he has told me that greater is he that is in me than he who is in the world he's already told me that when you come in like a flood his spirit shall raise up a standard Saints we do not need anything else we already have all what we need all we need is to ask God to open our eyes Hallelujah to see what he sees us in his word and the moment we receive that Revelation oh let's finish this and we can walk therein brother sister you're going to be an unshakable army praise the name of the Lord Jesus and he says you don't reason with God's word it has no reason it is just God's word there there's no there's no doubt about it there's no reasoning to it it's God's word and that settles it if he says the promis is unto you and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call God said it that settles it that settles it forever see what I mean they said to Abraham how do you know your you're going to have the baby God said so that settled it they want passes uh Sarah deia are you feeling any different uh no Abraham I'm not feeling anything different and then Abraham says don't worry my love if God does not do it today he will do it tomorrow tomorrow comes next week comes if God does not do it next week he will do it the coming month if God does not do it the coming month God will do it the next year the
