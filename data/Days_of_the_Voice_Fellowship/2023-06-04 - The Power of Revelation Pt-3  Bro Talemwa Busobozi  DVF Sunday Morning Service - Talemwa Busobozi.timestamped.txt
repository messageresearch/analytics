[1:18:50] if you're there just say Amen what does
[1:18:52] all right so we read together verse six
[1:18:59] we can begin from verse 5.
[1:19:02] by faith Enoch was translated that he
[1:19:05] should not see death and was not found
[1:19:08] because God had transited him
[1:19:11] for before his translation he had this
[1:19:14] testimony that he pleased God
[1:19:17] is a
[1:19:54] which we shall really dwell on but for
[1:19:57] now let us ask God to bless his one and
[1:19:59] then you'll be seated father we commit
[1:20:01] this word into your hands that we have
[1:20:02] read
[1:20:05] these people into your hands as well
[1:20:08] just give me the grace Lord to speak to
[1:20:11] them that the word will penetrate their
[1:20:13] hearts
[1:20:16] direct my thoughts
[1:20:19] and everything Lord and give us a good
[1:20:23] atmosphere
[1:20:24] that your holy spirit will be pleased
[1:20:26] with us this morning
[1:20:29] Father we ask this blessing in Jesus
[1:20:31] name
[1:20:36] praise the Lord now I'd like to bring
[1:20:39] greetings to you in the name of Jesus
[1:20:41] Christ this morning
[1:20:44] when you greet your neighbor and tell
[1:20:46] them God bless you
[1:20:49] so uh this morning
[1:20:52] um I'm happy that you prayed for me and
[1:20:55] I'm back safely
[1:20:59] the ones who prayed for me I want to say
[1:21:01] God bless you
[1:21:04] God answered your prayers that I'm back
[1:21:06] when I'm well
[1:21:10] amen and not only that but also God gave
[1:21:12] us wonderful a wonderful time in Germany
[1:21:17] we really had a uh it was a supernatural
[1:21:21] weekend for me um
[1:21:24] you know in the meetings there we had a
[1:21:27] lot of Believers and ministers and
[1:21:29] people coming in from different
[1:21:30] countries
[1:21:36] the meetings were hosted by the pastor
[1:21:39] in Germany brother God Road
[1:21:44] who has been in the message for quite
[1:21:48] very many years maybe almost 50 now um
[1:21:54] and so uh we had the ministers and
[1:21:56] Saints from Belgium
[1:22:01] Italy England Germany Russia Poland
[1:22:04] Ukraine Ukraine notice you were in a
[1:22:07] meeting
[1:22:08] in one in one of the services we had a
[1:22:11] prayer line
[1:22:14] and one of the pastors that was with us
[1:22:17] on the prayer line um
[1:22:20] was a pastor Sagi from Russia
[1:22:25] Moscow and
[1:22:27] some believers who are coming to be
[1:22:29] prayed for we are from Ukraine
[1:22:33] and you know in Ukraine and Russia they
[1:22:35] speak the same language
[1:22:37] and so these people could not be able to
[1:22:39] express themselves in in Germany or in
[1:22:42] English
[1:22:45] had to interpret for brother Timothy and
[1:22:49] the rest of us uh
[1:22:52] um for these people from in Russian or
[1:22:55] stroke Ukrainian to to to English
[1:23:05] and you those of us who know what is
[1:23:08] happening in Russia and Ukraine you're
[1:23:09] like that is impossible
[1:23:14] but that's confirmed to me
[1:23:17] in the believer's world
[1:23:20] we are completely in another world
[1:23:23] we are living in the world but we are
[1:23:26] not of the world no matter what is going
[1:23:29] on in the politics of the regions or the
[1:23:31] politics of the world
[1:23:34] the believer is not really that much
[1:23:37] affected
[1:23:38] because what affects us is what is in
[1:23:43] our world
[1:23:45] I'm glad to be a part of this world
[1:23:49] there was war in Ukraine
[1:24:02] praying for ukrainians that have been
[1:24:04] maybe lost their families or lost things
[1:24:06] or lost and he's praying for them and
[1:24:08] comforting them in the Lord
[1:24:15] that means that we are citizens
[1:24:19] I was really glad to see that I
[1:24:23] understand with this man of God in on
[1:24:25] the battlefronto
[1:24:28] and uh I by God's grace we we had most
[1:24:32] of the services uh uh on the weekend
[1:24:35] preached by brother Tim and brother
[1:24:37] Timothy orange
[1:24:43] and brother God asked me to preach the
[1:24:45] first service on I think it was on a
[1:24:47] Friday
[1:24:51] and uh
[1:24:54] we agree that it will be the appetizer
[1:24:57] for the services
[1:25:00] but I was really humbled I mean there
[1:25:02] were many many ministers who would have
[1:25:04] stood chance
[1:25:07] God gave us Grace I know that some of
[1:25:09] you streamed that service
[1:25:13] and those who did not get a chance
[1:25:15] because you know in Germany they are not
[1:25:18] like in the U.S or other capitalist
[1:25:20] countries
[1:25:33] to even access the service because it
[1:25:35] was you have to sign in on our website
[1:25:38] to access it
[1:25:43] I said brother God I said brother God
[1:25:46] would it be okay for me to stream uh the
[1:25:48] weekend of these meetings on our Channel
[1:25:49] on YouTube
[1:25:51] kids
[1:25:57] I asked about that uh brother Isaac is
[1:26:00] going to be putting it up I think the
[1:26:01] first one is when
[1:26:04] sorry
[1:26:06] 9 pm today
[1:26:09] and I think that will be the service I
[1:26:11] preached
[1:26:15] basically I was giving my testimony and
[1:26:17] gave a little exportation
[1:26:20] and then uh the rest of the meetings
[1:26:23] will also follow I think we'll announce
[1:26:25] to you when or you just keep checking on
[1:26:27] the channel it will be uploaded there
[1:26:29] and then you can be able to stream it
[1:26:30] and share it with others it was a
[1:26:32] blessing
[1:26:37] and so I also had a wonderful time you
[1:26:40] know brother Tim brother Tim Pruitt what
[1:26:42] kind of team prude is a man that has
[1:26:44] preached this message for more than 50
[1:26:47] years
[1:26:50] and if I've seen
[1:26:53] ministers that are balanced in the world
[1:26:58] but the team fruit is really one of them
[1:27:02] and I really uh love the way he delivers
[1:27:06] the word
[1:27:08] and God has prospered his ministry over
[1:27:11] the years
[1:27:13] and ever since brother Eddie biscal
[1:27:16] invited him in one of his meetings in
[1:27:18] Canada
[1:27:22] 2007.
[1:27:25] stream into one of those meetings
[1:27:28] it was an immense blessing to me so I've
[1:27:30] been following that brother's Ministry
[1:27:35] and so we had time in Fellowship you
[1:27:37] know speaking of about the ministry and
[1:27:40] you know like I I can say that he was
[1:27:42] imparting on me all the years of his
[1:27:46] ministry and I really felt it was a big
[1:27:48] blessing for me
[1:27:58] from here in Uganda and basically in
[1:28:01] Africa that go to Europe or to America
[1:28:04] to to receive a money impartation
[1:28:12] and I was really very embarrassed
[1:28:16] as they were telling me of some of these
[1:28:18] names of people
[1:28:21] from here
[1:28:23] keep writing letters
[1:28:29] what I told these brothers I said Luke
[1:28:32] brothers
[1:28:34] because I understand that this came in
[1:28:37] from a long history
[1:28:46] Uganda and I really need to tell you
[1:28:48] this
[1:28:49] wanted to come to you guys
[1:28:53] but he failed to come because of War now
[1:28:56] and at the time you know Uganda was kind
[1:29:00] of uh broken into many pieces
[1:29:03] people did not have clothes
[1:29:06] people did not have food they didn't
[1:29:10] even have time to cultivate them
[1:29:12] and so they wouldn't have education
[1:29:16] schools no Healthcare
[1:29:18] Systems we were broken down because of
[1:29:21] you know it was like a war-ton country
[1:29:22] in Colorado
[1:29:25] some of the brothers that came here
[1:29:27] those many years ago
[1:29:31] and so all they could do was to support
[1:29:33] give money support give money for
[1:29:36] everything
[1:29:40] you know they have to come and preach
[1:29:43] meetings they have to rent a building
[1:29:44] like this so they have to pay cutting
[1:29:46] the
[1:30:05] we might not have attained what they
[1:30:07] have attained
[1:30:09] but we are no longer where Uganda was 30
[1:30:13] 40 years ago
[1:30:17] I spoke to the Brethren and I told them
[1:30:20] this is another generation
[1:30:23] we are in another generation
[1:30:25] and I told them I mean like I knew but
[1:30:28] I've known brother God for very many
[1:30:30] years
[1:30:32] and they said to him I mean like I've
[1:30:34] never written you to ask for any money
[1:30:37] but I had needs everybody
[1:30:41] whether they are white or black but we
[1:30:45] need to have a realization
[1:30:47] that the god of the whites is
[1:30:54] when they followed his words
[1:31:01] and so I clearly put it to the Brethren
[1:31:03] together
[1:31:05] them if there is anything I've come for
[1:31:07] here
[1:31:08] once you invited me do I desire to come
[1:31:13] because but the team put was going to be
[1:31:15] in this meeting
[1:31:17] take part in them because I was really
[1:31:21] immensely blessed
[1:31:23] and we had a good a real good time in
[1:31:25] discussing about the ministry and about
[1:31:27] you know the work of the Lord and his
[1:31:29] experience over there
[1:31:34] we also pray together with him it was a
[1:31:38] really wonderful time
[1:31:39] and so we met also quite a several
[1:31:42] friends some of which are are going to
[1:31:45] come and visit us
[1:31:46] [Music]
[1:31:49] from Russia
[1:31:52] I said if you came to Uganda you will be
[1:31:56] the first preacher from Russia
[1:32:01] how many would like to see him
[1:32:10] you would say well this message is from
[1:32:12] American is a Russian and a Russian
[1:32:14] America you know oh how come let me tell
[1:32:16] you this message is not American message
[1:32:21] this message is from the mind of God
[1:32:25] and so there's a lot that we can talk
[1:32:27] about the trip but I think I will not
[1:32:28] take more time I want us to just go
[1:32:30] right into the world
[1:32:33] but I want to appreciate the ministers
[1:32:36] Brother Martin brother
[1:32:37] uh Joel and the other musicians and the
[1:32:41] brothers that have really stood
[1:32:46] a club
[1:32:49] I've heard that you've had wonderful
[1:32:51] meetings
[1:33:02] this morning I just want to continue you
[1:33:05] remember the last time I left I was
[1:33:07] going to speak on the power of
[1:33:08] Revelation part 2.
[1:33:13] so I ended up speaking on on it but I
[1:33:17] did not go into the what I wanted to go
[1:33:18] into so I'll this is like part three but
[1:33:21] it will really be the second part of
[1:33:22] that service
[1:33:29] so please go back to the Village Hebrews
[1:33:32] 11.
[1:33:34] [Music]
[1:33:37] um
[1:33:38] we'll begin from verses one so we can be
[1:33:40] able to see the whole thing
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:44] now Faith is a substance of things hoped
[1:33:47] for the evidence of things not sinus
[1:33:55] for by it the elders obtained a good
[1:33:57] report
[1:34:01] through faith we understand that the
[1:34:04] words were framed by the word of God so
[1:34:07] that things which are seen were not made
[1:34:10] of things which do appear
[1:34:12] again
[1:34:19] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[1:34:22] excellent sacrifice than that of Caine
[1:34:29] by which he obtained witness that he was
[1:34:32] righteous God testifying of his gifts
[1:34:35] and by it he being dead yet
[1:34:43] is
[1:34:49] that a man by faith Enoch was translated
[1:34:53] that he should not see death
[1:34:58] and was not found because God had
[1:35:02] translated him
[1:35:05] for before his translation he had he had
[1:35:08] this testimony that he pleased
[1:35:13] so you see Hebrews 11 News goes on and
[1:35:18] on and on and on again he speaks us of
[1:35:22] so many
[1:35:23] and he says that they pleased God by
[1:35:26] faith
[1:35:28] and you know he spoke of Abel okay he
[1:35:32] spoke he spoke of Abraham
[1:35:37] actually very many
[1:35:41] and he continued stressing the point it
[1:35:44] was by Faith
[1:35:48] by faith
[1:35:52] people like Daniel in the land
[1:36:06] can you imagine an offering David is a
[1:36:09] natural way why you cannot give to God
[1:36:12] an offering and God accepts it if it is
[1:36:14] not by faith
[1:36:19] it must be by faith
[1:36:25] if it is
[1:36:50] impossible to please God every one of us
[1:36:55] let us read verses six together
[1:36:59] one two three go but without faith but
[1:37:04] without faith
[1:37:08] let us do it again maybe you are not
[1:37:10] there yet let us do it again
[1:37:11] now
[1:37:38] the Pentecostals have taught us faith
[1:37:43] and some of them have described Faith
[1:37:47] something that you do you work
[1:37:50] no I believe it is going to be
[1:37:53] I I I accept it I see it is
[1:38:04] so what is faith
[1:38:07] faith the Bible says the substance
[1:38:12] call your neighbors faith is a substance
[1:38:16] is a substance
[1:38:24] it is something that you have a
[1:38:28] naturally yet you are going to attain it
[1:38:30] is
[1:38:38] all under one umbrella with your
[1:38:42] navigation when he said what is faith
[1:38:46] in the message the anointed ones at the
[1:38:49] end times
[1:38:50] faith is something that is revealed to
[1:38:53] you
[1:38:57] five is something that is revealed to
[1:38:59] you
[1:39:01] praise the name of the Lord come here
[1:39:03] let me tell you
[1:39:05] something can be open
[1:39:08] but we're not revealed
[1:39:16] and the book is an open book
[1:39:19] the book is full of promises
[1:39:23] full of you know what God has promised
[1:39:26] his children
[1:39:29] the book is showing us what we are going
[1:39:31] to be
[1:39:32] in the bed the book is demonstrating
[1:39:35] what a child of God
[1:39:39] now everything in that open books
[1:39:45] because God has said it is
[1:39:53] not
[1:39:56] good to you foreign
[1:40:23] [Music]
[1:40:59] does God want me to do that quality how
[1:41:03] can I attain this you know how can I
[1:41:06] attain that how can I find a wife
[1:41:09] how can I find a business
[1:41:13] profitable
[1:41:14] how can I know good to associate
[1:41:19] how can I know this is why I'm supposed
[1:41:22] to be how can I know
[1:41:25] is my pastor how can I know you're
[1:41:29] supposed to be a part of the other team
[1:41:32] how can I know let me tell you brothers
[1:41:48] and faith cannot be shared all cookies
[1:41:52] it is something that is revealed to you
[1:41:58] people when some something is revealed
[1:42:00] to you
[1:42:01] could be people will try to talk you out
[1:42:04] of it
[1:42:05] they will try to make you as a fail as
[1:42:08] if you were a failure
[1:42:10] oh but because you have faith because
[1:42:13] job Revelations
[1:42:30] faith is a revelation from God
[1:42:35] faith is a revelation
[1:42:38] tell your neighbor faith is a revelation
[1:42:43] if your neighbor is
[1:42:50] if you tell somebody come on
[1:43:01] it is a revelation he has revealed it to
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:07] by his grace it is
[1:43:18] given to you by the grace of God
[1:43:24] hallelujah amen and God reveals it to
[1:43:27] you
[1:43:28] therefore faith is a revelation
[1:43:33] and the whole Church of God is built
[1:43:35] upon the Revelation
[1:43:38] and how does faith
[1:43:42] foreign
[1:43:54] why do we come to church
[1:43:56] why do we Fellowship every time
[1:43:59] why do we every time should we hear the
[1:44:01] words
[1:44:02] the reason is simple without faith does
[1:44:07] not please God thank you
[1:44:17] we need that faith
[1:44:20] comes by here
[1:44:23] in the world
[1:44:38] pray is the name of the Lord and this
[1:44:41] morning I'm going to show you very many
[1:44:42] people here
[1:44:44] three or four people as examples to us
[1:44:48] this morning
[1:44:49] and then you will see the power of
[1:44:51] Revelation
[1:44:52] and when God gave me this inspiration
[1:44:59] I've left it at home
[1:45:01] by inspiration
[1:45:05] when something is revealed to him
[1:45:09] it is time for it to happen amen
[1:45:15] hallelujah amen
[1:45:19] Hallelujah
[1:45:21] that moment
[1:45:25] it is
[1:45:39] um I will read from the message out from
[1:45:41] the message uh wax is no no no just a
[1:45:45] moment
[1:45:45] I'll get the message I want to read from
[1:45:48] uh wax is Faith expressed yes
[1:46:00] I wanted to listen to this word
[1:46:04] amen Amina and as I'm preaching to you
[1:46:06] maybe some of you will receive face
[1:46:16] because that moment something is about
[1:46:20] one way before I talk about David
[1:46:25] no man had no Revelation
[1:46:29] came all the way
[1:46:32] from where he came from to come in
[1:46:35] Israel and when he arrived there the
[1:46:39] reason why he came was because he had
[1:46:41] there was a prophet of God in Israel
[1:46:44] the reason why you have come it's
[1:46:47] because
[1:46:52] you know in this place
[1:46:55] is sent out to you
[1:46:58] when you hear that message without faith
[1:47:02] they know nothing will happen to you
[1:48:02] without revelation
[1:48:04] Ghana
[1:49:25] which will change
[1:49:28] I need let me let me tell you the gospel
[1:49:30] engineering is not the only word she
[1:49:32] became of your car the gospel
[1:49:35] Gamble and action words and life
[1:49:39] praise the name of the Lord Jesus did
[1:49:42] not just preach yesterday
[1:49:45] but he also opened the eyes of the blind
[1:49:49] he also made the lamb to work so the
[1:49:53] gospel Angel is not only word she became
[1:49:55] of your career not to be educated people
[1:49:58] we are not to be educated only
[1:50:01] if we are only educated message
[1:50:04] Believers
[1:50:06] we have the mechanics but we have no
[1:50:08] Dynamics
[1:50:11] which we are preaching to you Allah is
[1:50:28] much has the potentially that's the
[1:50:31] power let me tell you the world is
[1:50:33] powerful the Bible says
[1:50:47] you need to have faith you need to have
[1:50:50] Revelations
[1:51:15] you can choose to go back to Urban and
[1:51:16] fever
[1:51:20] or go and die with your lips
[1:51:25] God doesn't change his words
[1:51:34] stop if you want to go to work
[1:51:37] do what he's watching this is what is
[1:51:41] not debatable
[1:51:43] difference between the message Believers
[1:51:45] and the denominations
[1:51:58] now here comes a man who begins to
[1:52:02] debate with the prophet
[1:52:03] and the prophet said what I say change
[1:52:06] is
[1:52:11] it wasn't even written
[1:52:16] sometimes you can come in the church
[1:52:19] and a preacher speak to you directly
[1:52:21] tell you something just there
[1:52:26] he's just excited
[1:52:28] nothing will happen
[1:52:31] nothing will happen
[1:52:33] if you receive a revelation
[1:52:36] that is
[1:52:38] and then maybe he speaks to you in the
[1:52:41] ministers
[1:53:15] [Applause]
[1:53:26] Hallelujah
[1:53:31] something was revealed to us
[1:53:35] she she you know she was like this is
[1:53:37] true
[1:53:44] and when she
[1:53:46] [Music]
[1:53:47] is
[1:54:00] the prophet of God also received another
[1:54:03] evidence
[1:54:13] and he spoke into her life
[1:54:21] said if she had asked for a million
[1:54:24] dollars
[1:54:32] but she asked for the Salvation
[1:54:36] and God saved all of them
[1:54:41] you have to have the right attitude
[1:55:03] I love it Revelation is
[1:55:10] by inspiration she came to him and she
[1:55:15] said
[1:55:19] foreign
[1:56:11] you see the impossibility
[1:56:22] Faith okay is a matter of the heart
[1:56:28] and that moment
[1:56:31] I was like okay what is that thing that
[1:56:36] made him
[1:56:39] to bow down
[1:56:46] and that's the only thing that pleases
[1:56:50] because when you have faitha
