[14:46] [Music]
[15:35] [Music]
[16:37] [Music]
[16:52] okay greetings for everyone god bless
[16:55] you
[16:57] this is all
[17:02] okay so
[17:04] i just want to welcome you
[17:08] to our program tonight
[17:38] loving jesus
[17:56] [Music]
[17:58] um
[18:06] now uh i would like to
[18:23] now i'm gonna
[18:30] okay
[18:40] okay
[18:54] is
[19:08] is
[19:36] yes
[19:59] okay so gloria can you hear me
[20:24] okay i think i'm going to have to change
[20:28] and use this other microphone i hope
[20:31] there
[20:32] i'm fine and everybody can hear you know
[20:34] it is raining
[20:35] and it kind of stabilizes the audio
[20:40] i hope that now you can hear and that
[20:43] you can hear well
[20:52] okay so i need this closed up
[21:13] all right so the reason why
[21:17] uh the reason why
[21:21] everybody's not like by the ocalo for
[21:24] this evening
[21:26] is because uh
[21:30] brother o'kello these people
[21:34] were very busy enjoying the god and they
[21:37] forgot about
[21:38] continuing to read again you know the
[21:41] other
[21:41] friday we were supposed to be sharing
[21:45] on the path most vision the last bit of
[21:47] which and so the people were very busy
[21:49] enjoying their goat and they forgot
[21:51] about
[21:53] you know that but anyways we also had
[21:55] another wonderful time
[21:56] we went into other discussions and
[21:59] testimonies
[22:00] really how many enjoyed that yeah that
[22:03] was wonderful praise the lord
[22:05] because it was a wonderful time
[22:06] nonetheless and so we do not think it
[22:09] was a loss
[22:10] it was a good time you know
[22:14] some brother banham speaks about people
[22:17] who replace
[22:19] the leadership of the holy spirit with
[22:21] the program
[22:23] so i wouldn't want us to replace the
[22:25] leadership of the holy spirit with
[22:26] programs
[22:27] it's good for us to have programs it's
[22:30] good for us to be organized
[22:32] but also above all it is better for us
[22:35] always to really
[22:36] follow the leadership of the holy spirit
[22:37] so when he leads us
[22:39] into certain things that we have not
[22:40] planned we
[22:42] again go in as he has led us
[22:45] praise the lord so this evening i think
[22:48] i'm going to do much of the talking
[22:50] because
[22:51] yeah thank you for sister arcelo for
[22:54] telling me it's not
[22:55] better now uh
[22:58] i'm going to do much of the talking this
[23:00] evening i know that there could be some
[23:01] who have wanted to talk or you
[23:03] oh what a question that they have not
[23:04] sent in but really questions should
[23:06] always be sent in
[23:08] because even if i don't deal with them i
[23:10] have them here
[23:11] you know those that i've not dealt with
[23:13] we shall have to deal with them
[23:15] uh but the reason why i'm going to do
[23:16] much of the talking is i'm going to
[23:18] to do like a recap on the patmos vision
[23:22] amen who is here that did not talk the
[23:25] other time
[23:29] who is that brother
[23:33] brother did you give us your revolution
[23:35] last time
[23:38] everybody did you you were not there
[23:42] okay brother shame we need the we need
[23:44] the camera please
[23:54] yes so uh
[23:58] sister ah okay i was going to call you
[24:02] the other name but i think i should
[24:03] stick with the one we know sister lucas
[24:05] i know that uh you did not give us your
[24:07] submission last time
[24:09] for the uh for the patmos vision and i
[24:12] think he will say something
[24:13] then from you will directly directly
[24:16] take it back and
[24:17] and give a few comments
[24:24] okay just a moment let me put the other
[24:26] can you also work on this so that you
[24:28] can be able to go
[24:30] a little far for people to hear the
[24:32] sister
[24:41] you you cannot put that audio i'm going
[24:42] to use this so just
[24:50] [Music]
[24:57] so sister can we
[25:18] [Music]
[25:23] it was
[25:35] it was where they put that seat
[25:48] [Music]
[25:55] help them see it this is vision
[26:21] okay can you read the portion
[26:28] let me just use another
[26:31] electric illustration
[26:35] suppose you need what does the word
[26:39] what does that word say well we have to
[26:42] read it
[26:44] complex countless things but
[26:48] but they look good in the spirit
[26:52] when reading means did we
[26:56] ask god for his spirit to
[26:59] teach us the real truth of it
[27:03] if we did
[27:09] we will call the elders confess our sins
[27:13] be anointed be anointed and prayed for
[27:17] and that would be that it might not
[27:20] come immediately but in
[27:24] in but in this spirit but it's in his
[27:27] spirit
[27:28] it is all over there is no other
[27:31] thought over pain what will fulfill his
[27:35] word
[27:37] for we need to get in the spirit
[27:41] and then things will be done
[27:45] don't go through the acts first
[27:49] first get in the spirit and then go
[27:52] through
[27:53] the acts and watch what will happen
[27:58] and what what would you do
[28:14] that don't go through the arts i don't
[28:17] know if i
[28:18] i've understood it wrongly but what i've
[28:21] understood from this paragraph is
[28:24] because in acts many people were placed
[28:28] in the name of
[28:29] all of jesus christ
[28:33] understood this one he was saying
[28:37] we should not be we should not first be
[28:40] baptized in the name of our lord jesus
[28:42] christ before
[28:44] receiving the holy ghost
[28:47] because as we say
[28:51] everyone who is baptized in the everyone
[28:54] will understand that
[28:55] jesus christ our lord of the holy ghosts
[29:00] so the way i understood this like
[29:04] we we should first receive the holy
[29:07] spirit
[29:08] that we first know who jesus christ is
[29:13] like people in the they first knew
[29:16] who jesus christ was after
[29:20] the place in the name of our
[29:39] yes i know i kept it short last time
[29:44] so um
[30:06] which means
[30:34] how
[30:37] [Music]
[30:48] yes
[31:03] doesn't matter all of those can come
[31:06] before
[31:08] like that's two thirty points
[31:21] and then you wash the water wash away
[31:25] wash you as a vessel
[31:28] then you present yourself with this
[31:30] water
[31:44] only
[32:13] to this
[32:17] have you ever noticed how the world gets
[32:19] into the spiritual things that are in
[32:21] the world
[32:22] they go to their board games their
[32:25] sporting events
[32:26] and their dancing they enter into the
[32:29] spirit of
[32:30] it they don't sit there like wall
[32:33] flowers
[32:34] old dried up sticks they enter right
[32:38] into the field of things and become a
[32:40] part of things
[32:42] but oh how they hate the christians for
[32:45] getting
[32:46] the spirit of god's one they call us
[32:51] and holy rollers there is nothing they
[32:55] won't do to show their hatred
[32:57] and disapproval but ignore that
[33:01] you can expect it knowing where that is
[33:04] coming from
[33:06] just go on and get in the spirit of
[33:08] worship
[33:22] no
[33:25] so i don't know if you understood the
[33:27] point because
[33:28] you know i think we also did talk about
[33:30] last time and i was saying that uh
[33:33] you know before you do anything you have
[33:36] to first enter into the spirit of that
[33:38] thing
[33:39] you know when you see people uh drinking
[33:42] alcohol
[33:42] and dancing and they have to first get
[33:46] into the spirit of doing that
[33:48] before they begin doing it or else they
[33:50] will not want
[33:51] they will not do it you know so we
[33:53] notice that there are many people
[33:55] uh that go to play football
[33:58] not only football but also other games
[34:00] before
[34:01] they do those things they have to get
[34:03] into the spirit
[34:05] of doing it you know even they got
[34:08] themselves the
[34:08] way they paid themselves you know
[34:12] if you go for example to watch football
[34:16] and to support it you do not go as
[34:19] someone that
[34:19] is going in a nightclub
[34:22] and someone who is going in the
[34:24] nightcraft does not go next time who is
[34:25] going
[34:26] in uh you know that's what i'm saying so
[34:29] ever again you go to there is a spirit
[34:31] around me
[34:33] actually one day i was watching uh there
[34:36] is this man
[34:37] what was his name this black man who had
[34:38] made himself like a white man
[34:40] what is his name michael jackson yes
[34:44] i i did watch someone you know you
[34:47] showed me you told me about that
[34:48] so i didn't watch the youtube and i was
[34:50] shocked you can check it and find out
[34:53] don't watch watch much of that stuff it
[34:55] will just put you into another kind of
[34:57] speed
[34:58] but you see what i want to highlight for
[35:00] you was as the people came
[35:02] around a you know of course the stage
[35:05] was already prepared for him
[35:07] putting the people into the speed of
[35:08] michael jackson and everything
[35:10] and then eventually he came now when he
[35:13] was entering into the beauty
[35:16] the people started throwing up others
[35:18] jumping jumping jumping jumping falling
[35:20] down and losing their mind and then
[35:22] others were you know they would bring
[35:24] the stress another stretcher
[35:26] yeah they would really put them on and
[35:28] start you know
[35:31] you would think that this is a church
[35:34] you think
[35:35] the holy ghost has fallen upon them it
[35:37] was in the holy ghost
[35:39] it was the spirit of michael jackson it
[35:40] was a spirit of air
[35:43] the people love me so much but they feel
[35:45] like they cry
[35:46] they shout they they have a lot of
[35:49] emotion
[35:50] around what they are doing in the same
[35:53] way actually
[35:54] these are some of the things i thank you
[35:55] for bringing this because it's one of
[35:57] the things i wanted to first begin with
[35:59] here
[35:59] in my highlights for the patmos vision
[36:01] some of the things that i wanted to
[36:03] re-emphasize on before you serve god
[36:06] you must also get into the spirit all
[36:09] these people that you see
[36:11] then you know they don't just jump down
[36:12] because they are more normal
[36:14] because they are how do they call it
[36:18] disco they have to get into the spirit
[36:20] of those things
[36:22] so you don't think that you're going to
[36:23] come that's why by either way do you
[36:25] know why we
[36:26] say how many no are we singing before we
[36:29] pray
[36:31] to get in the spirit do you remember
[36:34] that man
[36:35] uh what was his name um
[36:39] soul king soul king's soul
[36:42] was a man that would get uh of course
[36:46] initially he had a spirit of crisis on
[36:47] him so he was anointed but time came
[36:51] when the spirit of god left him
[36:52] of course when god removed the kingdom
[36:54] from him because of disobedience
[36:57] also the holy spirit left him so from
[37:00] that time
[37:01] this man did not have the spirit of god
[37:05] and demons would come when the spirit of
[37:07] god left him
[37:09] demons would now come to meet you how
[37:12] many remember what happened to you
[37:18] come on now when a bible study i will
[37:20] not
[37:34] was
[37:36] he was depressed and then he sent
[37:39] for a musician
[37:42] to come and give me music and personally
[37:44] what was david
[37:46] so they wish they would perform into
[37:47] something that if
[37:54] and uh what happened
[37:57] why is it that when david played
[38:01] the music by that was he just singing oh
[38:03] he was he playing something
[38:07] and
[38:11] without a boy
[38:44] is
[38:58] uh
[39:12] yes
[39:25] the spirit of uh
[39:29] of the devil would come on him david
[39:32] would be called actually of course they
[39:34] say
[39:35] send for a man that is anointed
[39:40] send for someone from the kingdom who is
[39:42] anointed
[39:45] yes anointed to be able to chase out
[39:48] these demons out of the king
[39:50] but that person one had to be anointed
[39:55] do you have to be a skillful
[39:59] player or musician that's why when we
[40:02] were doing something when someone
[40:04] does is better than you leave them to do
[40:06] it if you're playing the table and you
[40:08] see someone knows it better than you
[40:09] need them to play
[40:11] if you are doing this thing and someone
[40:13] is better than you whatever you're doing
[40:14] for the world someone is better than you
[40:16] let them do it
[40:17] it's not in a bad spirit you know it's
[40:20] because you want it to be
[40:22] done perfect you want it to be where you
[40:24] want it to be that way
[40:25] for what for the kingdom of god we do
[40:28] not do what we do in order to make a
[40:30] name for ourselves
[40:32] you never serve god in order to make a
[40:34] name you serve god because you are
[40:36] you are doing it many of us and each of
[40:39] us actually
[40:40] have a skill you know you have a skill
[40:43] each of you have a skill that god has
[40:45] given to you you've been going with it
[40:47] so when you come into the
[40:48] when you're in the world the devil the
[40:50] world takes not even it doesn't always
[40:53] doesn't even have to be the devil when
[40:55] you are in the world the devil takes
[40:56] those skills
[40:58] and he kind of
[41:02] uses them to further his kingdom
[41:06] can you imagine so when you come to the
[41:08] lord many people they withhold those
[41:11] [Music]
[41:19] this time it skills me sorry
[41:22] so when they disrespect the world
[41:26] they come to the lord they fail to yield
[41:29] their skills to the lord
[41:31] and they want the devil to continue
[41:34] using their skills
[41:35] why they bring their their body their
[41:36] flesh to you thank you to the lord
[41:39] well the doctor is not interested in
[41:40] your body actually he's not even
[41:42] interested in your body at all
[41:45] so ask yourself what have you bringing
[41:47] to the lord when you come to him
[41:48] are you just bringing him a pound of
[41:50] flesh and let me just sit there
[41:53] after all they saw that i was there even
[41:55] if i don't do anything
[41:56] do something find something to do
[41:58] actually when you receive the holy ghost
[42:00] you cannot be seated there you will have
[42:03] to do something
[42:04] the holy spirit will put you into action
[42:06] actually the one of the world is still
[42:07] in the church
[42:08] who knows it
[42:15] come on come on speak up someone who is
[42:17] ready to contribute you want to
[42:18] contribute
[42:20] yes come on explain your points when the
[42:23] holy spirit comes in you
[42:25] what is his work because you are the
[42:28] body of christ
[42:30] so when the holy spirit comes in you
[42:33] what does he do that's my question
[42:42] all right that's the fine the whole
[42:44] spirit suddenly leads us and guides us
[42:46] but what does he do there is something
[42:48] i'm trying to find out
[42:49] yes yes by the margin you want to
[42:51] contribute towards that
[42:56] um
[43:11] we are like the arms of the holy spirit
[43:14] we are like his arms
[43:15] we are like his hands and uh but there
[43:18] is something
[43:19] yeah that is true also but there's
[43:21] something i'm trying to find
[43:22] yes yes yes we
[43:38] change
[43:51] [Music]
[44:01] to make a life yes to make a life that's
[44:05] what i was looking for
[44:06] if that same spirit
[44:10] that raised christ from the dead you can
[44:12] sit with me now
[44:13] dwell in you where is
[44:28] [Music]
[44:32] he shall quickly
[44:39] [Music]
[44:48] now
[44:57] [Music]
[45:01] when the spirit of jesus christ dwell in
[45:03] you he does what one thing
[45:05] he quickens your body look at it this
[45:07] way
[45:08] if you have eyes and the eyes cannot see
[45:12] did they call you a person they call you
[45:15] one
[45:16] blind
[45:20] you're not really a person you are a
[45:22] blind person
[45:24] if if you can't hear they'll not call
[45:27] you a person they will call you a deaf
[45:28] person
[45:29] you cease to be a full person you you
[45:32] become a person plus something or
[45:33] personal minor something
[45:35] so in the same way if you are a
[45:37] christian without the holy spirit
[45:39] you are not a full christian okay you
[45:42] are a deaf christian a blind christian
[45:54] he was telling them the reality of their
[45:56] situation
[45:57] if you don't have the holy spirit to
[45:59] discern
[46:00] your body is losing something so here's
[46:03] what the holy spirit does
[46:04] if if you are like this and the holy
[46:06] spirit comes in you
[46:08] your heart will become active if you
[46:11] if you are like this the whole spirit
[46:13] comes and you your head
[46:15] will become active your body will become
[46:17] active hallelujah
[46:19] now we are we have different parts of
[46:21] the body and we are actually different
[46:23] parts of the globe of christ the other
[46:24] west is all over the world yes now but
[46:27] you do not know which part you are until
[46:29] you receive
[46:30] the holy spirit when you receive the
[46:32] holy spirit then you can be able to
[46:34] identify
[46:35] what part of the body of christ that you
[46:38] are now if you realize you are ready
[46:42] what are you going to do
[46:44] you need to work
[46:48] thank you brother you are even taking it
[46:49] deeper if you realize you are aware you
[46:52] are going to go out and preach
[46:54] because you are realized you are called
[46:56] to be a minister
[46:58] you know what else is blessed are the
[46:59] feet of those that take the gospel
[47:01] of peace hallelujah so
[47:04] if you realize your hand what are you
[47:07] going to give to do
[47:20] give to others right if you realize
[47:30] singing preaching justifying
[47:33] you know if you realize you are what
[47:36] else come on
[47:44] some of you are gifted with sin that's
[47:47] right you know these gifts are born with
[47:48] you naturally but you don't know you
[47:50] don't realize it until you are quickened
[47:53] by the holy spirit when you are created
[47:55] by the holy spirit it kind of
[47:57] uh reminds you who you are and brings
[47:59] you into perspective the right
[48:00] perspective
[48:01] for you to be able to be useful to the
[48:03] kingdom of god
[48:04] but if you do not know what type of the
[48:08] type what part of the body that you are
[48:10] you're going to be useless
[48:12] so we have you in your body but you are
[48:14] actually negative
[48:16] you're making the body lying you're
[48:18] breaking the body
[48:20] blind or death or even actually in the
[48:23] body
[48:25] of christ is not the way they're
[48:26] supposed to be and it is supposed to be
[48:29] because the parts of that body are blind
[48:47] one okay we have another calculator now
[48:49] all right
[48:50] so it says what
[48:54] regulation yes you even know what does
[48:56] it say they are
[48:58] they are blind
[49:10] [Music]
[49:14] god bless you because you don't have the
[49:15] holy ghost if you have the holy ghost of
[49:18] the holy spirit someone who was saying
[49:19] that the holy ghost and the holy spirit
[49:21] are different
[49:21] you know that that's because that person
[49:23] never went to school okay
[49:25] but like
[49:29] yeah you know i i did english in my
[49:32] school and then
[49:33] i also studied a little bit about
[49:35] elizabethan english and
[49:36] you understand that language evolves and
[49:38] language changes
[49:40] it's not it's not static language
[49:42] changes even in uganda languages
[49:44] they are words that you no longer use
[49:45] other words you use that your mother or
[49:47] father or grandmother grandfather may
[49:49] not understand
[49:50] but it is actually the same one so we
[49:51] know that holy ghost
[49:53] then we used to mean spirit you know
[49:56] when he said ghost
[49:57] then used to mean spirit and spirit then
[50:00] used to mean
[50:01] like some evil spirit or something yeah
[50:03] you know
[50:04] and it is now the vice versa today so
[50:06] but we know
[50:07] we understand it's the same thing right
[50:09] spirit and ghost
[50:11] actually that was a ghost
[50:14] because i saw a ghost but then it used
[50:16] to be
[50:17] i saw a spirit i swear you understand
[50:20] but it is all the same
[50:21] spirit and ghost means spirit means
[50:23] spirit and when you put it
[50:25] on it then it becomes our holy spirit so
[50:28] if
[50:29] one goes through one species the same
[50:30] thing so when you receive the holy
[50:32] spirit when you receive the holy ghost
[50:34] you know your life changes you know you
[50:37] realize
[50:38] who you actually what part of the body
[50:40] that you are
[50:41] you become a life you're hey i'm a lady
[50:44] you know the child
[50:45] you know you need to watch when the
[50:47] children realize that they can go
[50:49] like what was happening all these times
[50:56] that's when you when you receive the
[50:57] holy spirit you realize that you used to
[50:59] do
[50:59] i mean you can do things you never
[51:00] thought that you can do so you will you
[51:03] always want to do it many times you know
[51:05] when i see people filled with the holy
[51:06] spirit they speak and they can when they
[51:08] realize they can speak in tongues my my
[51:10] mind
[51:10] almost every service they want to speak
[51:12] in tongues if you have never spoken
[51:13] times you won't even understand it
[51:15] until one day they realize oh well i now
[51:18] know who i am and
[51:20] you know they will speak tongues once in
[51:21] a while maybe if there's a special
[51:23] message
[51:23] the spirit is trying to pass you know
[51:25] and then and
[51:26] you know that when they see the whole
[51:28] speech one bit they'll always shout
[51:31] you know you know because something has
[51:34] happened in their life you know and it
[51:35] will be all the time almost every moment
[51:37] something's voiced
[51:40] but you know as they grow in christ not
[51:42] that the holy spirit will leave them
[51:44] but you see they begin you know now you
[51:46] don't run all the time do you
[51:48] why even when someone says you run
[51:52] you're like ah come on let me walk huh
[51:54] he's like i said but when you are young
[51:56] when you bring elephants
[51:58] or whatever this place he won't walk
[52:01] because he's
[52:02] just realizing i can walk but actually
[52:04] even now you can run
[52:06] closer and there are certain
[52:09] circumstances where you need to run
[52:11] there are certain circumstances where
[52:13] you need to shout
[52:14] where you need to speak in tongues where
[52:17] you need to prophesy
[52:18] where you need to get into that spirit
[52:20] of something that you are
[52:22] supposed the hospital is trying to do in
[52:23] your life okay
[52:25] i must be talking about the word
[52:26] speaking mainly but what i'm talking
[52:28] about right now
[52:29] is that when you receive the holy spirit
[52:31] here's the main thing
[52:33] that you become uh-huh the ones are just
[52:35] coming up
[52:36] you become an activated member of the
[52:39] body
[52:41] you become an activity part of the body
[52:43] before you receive it
[52:44] you are you know you are inactive you
[52:48] are dead
[52:48] you are almost dead you are inactive
[52:51] okay
[52:52] you can't dream a dream you can't sing a
[52:54] song you
[52:55] when they bring it let us sing a song
[52:57] which one is it he brought me on
[53:11] you know so it's like as if you are not
[53:13] in for it you think it is another song
[53:16] you know i'm not telling you people who
[53:17] are not in the spirit how do i behave
[53:20] they will always try to say it's as if
[53:21] it is the song that was the problem
[53:24] they were trying to say it is their
[53:26] their voice their vocal cords
[53:28] they were trying to say that they were
[53:29] not gifted to see they were trying to
[53:31] say the kid is very poor
[53:33] their kid is different their kick is
[53:35] high it is
[53:42] why because they are not even
[53:46] in the spirit so when you get
[53:49] into the spirit of any sin you will do
[53:52] oneness
[53:55] even a preacher if he just preaches love
[53:57] getting into the spirit of preaching
[53:59] that's why you go wait up on the road
[54:00] but abandon christians also waiting
[54:02] waiting on your ministry or waiting on
[54:04] your ministering you go somewhere and
[54:06] wait
[54:07] if your preacher you go somewhere and
[54:09] wait if you are a singer
[54:11] you go somewhere you don't just say
[54:14] oh by the way where i want to speak
[54:18] yourself just
[54:19] quickly no that's not right
[54:22] you know if you really want to minister
[54:24] a song did you hear
[54:25] that the language i used to do
[54:29] so you're not going to sing so that they
[54:31] can see you you are going to
[54:33] minister what is ministering someone
[54:35] help me
[54:42] is not necessary to preach my brother
[54:44] now are you saying
[54:45] i cannot minister so do you know
[54:59] to bless somebody to lift up somebody
[55:03] to you know impact
[55:06] someone to raise somebody you understand
[55:10] you can give him all those vocabularies
[55:12] to
[55:13] uplift a soul or a spirit to
[55:17] to view yes to bless too 85
[55:20] too come on now during college yes
[55:25] my grandson is right now
[55:28] when you are talking about the spirit
[55:31] ministry
[55:33] ministering is necessary to preach
[55:36] even a preacher is also a minister
[55:38] because ministering okay
[55:39] it's blessing uplifting and also you can
[55:42] do those things in
[55:43] other ways not only preaching your
[55:44] teaching
[55:46] so when you receive this spirit when you
[55:49] are ministering but the bible says
[55:50] everybody should wait on
[55:51] their military so if you're ministering
[55:54] a song don't just come to see her let me
[55:56] go and show them
[55:57] that i have a very good voice then you
[56:00] come
[56:00] and then evenly sometimes it doesn't
[56:02] work out well you know say
[56:04] you you know whenever you want to lift
[56:05] up to show yourself it never works
[56:08] you see you will come sing and then the
[56:10] vocal cords will tell please give me a
[56:11] break
[56:12] you're like what happened to me you know
[56:15] so but if you are
[56:16] you want to minister if your desire is
[56:18] to minister you wait for god because you
[56:21] realize
[56:21] within you you have no power to touch
[56:24] people's souls
[56:25] attack people's hearts so you wait on
[56:27] the world and ask him say lord
[56:29] please empower me you put yourself in
[56:31] that in that atmosphere where the worst
[56:33] people come
[56:34] and congeal your soul and the spirit and
[56:38] the
[56:38] activate now you come up in power
[56:42] to minister to bless to lift
[56:46] to uplift you understand to encourage
[56:49] so we if you want to do anything for the
[56:53] lord you can never do successfully
[56:55] without
[56:56] getting into the spirit and getting into
[56:59] the spirit does not necessarily mean
[57:07] come on i want to hear your opinions
[57:23] each of us here has their own
[57:27] how can i call it
[57:30] uh can i call the temperament
[57:34] each of us is
[57:37] built in a certain way okay
[57:40] they are acquired people among us like
[57:43] who
[57:44] like monkey all right you also hear your
[57:48] friend
[57:49] okay somebody's saying now let anna
[57:51] speak for you
[58:05] [Music]
[58:08] all right also sometimes you have people
[58:11] when they get excited they do several
[58:13] different things sometimes you someone
[58:16] gets excited they cry
[58:18] they just cry
[58:31] [Music]
[58:34] you brother it just becomes more obvious
[58:37] so you wonder what is happening
[58:40] when they get into the spirit they shout
[58:42] i don't know what all right
[58:44] i'm talking about the spirit when they
[58:46] are happy some of them they just shout
[58:50] [Applause]
[58:59] [Music]
[59:21] all right when people are happy they do
[59:22] different things depending on their
[59:24] natural mecca so what am i trying to say
[59:29] you are not going to come to a brother
[59:32] who is touched by the right by the holy
[59:35] spirit
[59:35] who is just by what and the tears are
[59:39] running down their cheeks but they are
[59:42] not
[59:43] falling down and talking in terms and
[59:45] let me tell them brother get in the
[59:46] spirit
[59:49] in the spirit but someone
[59:53] you know when we get into the spirit
[59:54] depending on our makeup and depending on
[59:57] the gifts
[59:57] the natural gifts that we have within
[1:00:00] different things
[1:00:00] others speak in times others like for me
[1:00:03] when i get into the spirit
[1:00:05] many times i feel like uh saving and
[1:00:08] when i sing
[1:00:09] and i get into the spirit i feel like
[1:00:10] prophesying or or
[1:00:12] you know you know you know giving a word
[1:00:14] of the of
[1:00:15] the of the spirit you understand but not
[1:00:18] everyone will prophesy
[1:00:19] not everyone will sing not everyone will
[1:00:22] shout
[1:00:23] and others if they don't shout out in
[1:00:25] the spirit
[1:00:26] you know they have shot and others have
[1:00:27] to roll on the floor actually i don't
[1:00:29] know how to fall down
[1:00:30] so you're not going to begin saying no
[1:00:32] i'm not falling down i'm not going to
[1:00:33] speak
[1:00:34] yeah but i have people
[1:00:37] speaking those words you know they're
[1:00:40] making it up
[1:00:41] so even you are also making eater others
[1:00:44] when they get into the spirit they feel
[1:00:45] like preaching
[1:00:47] their preachers for that matter if it is
[1:00:49] another preacher
[1:00:50] sister and you get into the spirit and
[1:00:52] you feel like oh i want to speak the
[1:00:54] word i
[1:01:08] use another chair here that if you want
[1:01:11] just use this
[1:01:12] okay extend extend this side all right
[1:01:16] okay so i'm also acting like a now
[1:01:20] okay now what is my point
[1:01:24] here i'm trying to emphasize
[1:01:27] the point here when john was in the
[1:01:29] spirit what did he do
[1:01:34] when john was in the spirit saints what
[1:01:36] did
[1:01:51] and then he wrote
[1:01:55] can you imagine writing down actually
[1:01:57] many times
[1:01:59] when i'm in the spirit and there is not
[1:02:00] no one to prophesy to
[1:02:03] you know you know it's like right now
[1:02:05] brother solomon i see you of course and
[1:02:06] i know you
[1:02:07] and i if i'm not in the spirit you know
[1:02:10] i may not tell you anything about your
[1:02:12] life but if i do get into the spirit
[1:02:14] then i'll be able almost to know you
[1:02:16] very well then the hospital reviewed
[1:02:18] me things that even i not know and i can
[1:02:19] begin today
[1:02:21] and if i'm around and i don't have
[1:02:22] anyone to you know speak to those words
[1:02:24] of inspiration
[1:02:26] what i will do i will quickly pick up a
[1:02:29] pen and paper and begin writing as the
[1:02:31] word speak is revealing to me
[1:02:33] and sometimes when i read it through
[1:02:34] maybe it is about me or someone else
[1:02:36] then
[1:02:36] if it's about someone else i would send
[1:02:38] it to them in another country
[1:02:40] the other day remember i was here in the
[1:02:42] church and we were
[1:02:43] preparing ourselves to go i was
[1:02:46] preparing myself to go to preach
[1:02:48] on the food and then brother was some
[1:02:50] reading
[1:02:51] so i was standing and then there is an
[1:02:52] advice i read oh
[1:02:54] it took me to the anointing and i i want
[1:02:57] to give the spirit when i went into the
[1:02:58] spirit
[1:02:59] i felt like prophesying but i was a lot
[1:03:01] of god in the room
[1:03:02] i could not uh to i could not go to the
[1:03:04] bottom
[1:03:05] of the public immediately i want to
[1:03:06] prophesy and what i did
[1:03:09] because the spirit of course is a
[1:03:12] is order yes i picked up a pen
[1:03:15] and i was gonna pick up a pen and paper
[1:03:17] but then i think
[1:03:18] like you know when you are in the spirit
[1:03:20] you are late to do the right things
[1:03:22] i felt like to pick up my phone and when
[1:03:24] i picked up my phone
[1:03:26] you know i didn't even know who i was
[1:03:28] going to write but i just started like
[1:03:30] talking to someone in that instance so
[1:03:32] when i picked up my phone
[1:03:34] just like i'm doing now just like i'm
[1:03:36] doing now
[1:03:38] but i just went and i realized
[1:03:41] uh the hospital was leading me to write
[1:03:44] to a brother brother
[1:03:45] brother kennedy when i went with the
[1:03:48] other time and i started writing once
[1:03:51] so the other time he was telling me what
[1:03:53] exactly was happening at that same time
[1:03:56] when that message came to him and when
[1:03:59] he read it he was asking god to speak to
[1:04:01] him about
[1:04:02] some things just he was in prayer asking
[1:04:05] god speaking about some things
[1:04:06] and that message was exactly answering
[1:04:09] those things which wanted god to speak
[1:04:10] about
[1:04:12] and here i was over 1000 kilometers away
[1:04:14] from where he is
[1:04:16] the holy spirit inspiring me so
[1:04:20] now here that's where we shall also get
[1:04:22] a point of
[1:04:23] what we talk about people hesitating
[1:04:25] when you are in the spirit of the holy
[1:04:27] spirit leaves you some people when they
[1:04:28] speak they are letting pray you know
[1:04:31] you know a spirit lady prayer is not
[1:04:33] like a prayer
[1:04:34] that you pray because you have to i
[1:04:37] speak like the play
[1:04:38] how many know what a spiritual prayer is
[1:04:41] yes someone wants to talk about it who
[1:04:43] are sorry about it
[1:04:45] now all of you are your hands up so you
[1:04:47] don't know it really
[1:04:49] okay can you can you highlight sister
[1:04:52] come on brother
[1:04:52] i want you to talk to tell us about
[1:04:55] experience and i'm happy with your
[1:04:56] sister
[1:04:57] who is going to talk about that because
[1:05:00] it's a very
[1:05:00] very important subject you know a prayer
[1:05:03] is a very important subject especially
[1:05:04] sisters
[1:05:05] that's your area really where not only
[1:05:07] sisters also brothers but really sisters
[1:05:09] one can use you so well on that on that
[1:05:12] area
[1:05:12] so uh can we can we have right on that
[1:05:16] on the subject so that this is like
[1:05:18] share with us
[1:05:34] that you are thinking about or sometimes
[1:05:37] you're there you bring your own things
[1:05:39] and you start singing singing and you
[1:05:43] the singing reaches your heart you sing
[1:05:46] from your heart you cry
[1:05:48] and pray and pray and pray how many have
[1:05:51] ever gone into that
[1:05:52] kind of scenario whereby the holy spirit
[1:05:55] comes
[1:05:55] upon them and they feel like you told
[1:05:58] the hospital
[1:06:00] amen all right now if you have never
[1:06:03] switched that moment
[1:06:04] if you have never reached that moment
[1:06:07] then i'm telling you
[1:06:08] you have missed out a lot
[1:06:11] you have missed out quiet a lot
[1:06:15] that's a spiritual prayer is the best
[1:06:18] thing that you will ever find yourself
[1:06:21] because when you want to have something
[1:06:24] all right
[1:06:25] if you're not baptized can the spirit
[1:06:28] come to you and start okay i've gone
[1:06:42] okay that's good okay you is
[1:07:00] i was singing when i sang
[1:07:03] a song i felt like
[1:07:06] praying i started crying i just went
[1:07:09] inside and closed the door and i started
[1:07:12] praying seriously like for
[1:07:14] 30 minutes then after i felt better
[1:07:18] i think all still can lead you
[1:07:21] even if you're not baptized okay
[1:07:24] how many have something to say about
[1:07:25] that you have a comment
[1:07:29] can i spill read you into prayer even
[1:07:31] for your baptized yes
[1:07:36] [Music]
[1:07:40] yes
[1:07:44] why do you believe it support your
[1:07:46] answer
[1:07:47] because uh to receive something from
[1:07:51] world seriously you need to be in the
[1:07:52] spirit
[1:07:54] and even
[1:08:08] which i wanted remember you're not a
[1:08:11] baptist
[1:08:12] yes you are not yet filled with the holy
[1:08:14] ghost
[1:08:15] but you need to be in
[1:08:22] four
[1:08:36] foreign
[1:08:46] not necessarily the holy spirit but the
[1:08:49] spirit of that field which is going to
[1:08:50] be great i
[1:08:53] and this is what the prophet tries to do
[1:08:56] to say here so you need to be in the
[1:08:59] spirit of anything before
[1:09:00] you receive reward from that thing or
[1:09:03] before you engage into that thing even
[1:09:06] before you receive the holy ghost now as
[1:09:08] baptism of the holy spirit
[1:09:10] you need to be in the spirit to be
[1:09:13] able to receive a full benefit of the
[1:09:16] things of god
[1:09:18] right yes for you to know the word you
[1:09:21] need to
[1:09:22] be in the spirit of the world even now
[1:09:24] we are doing a bible study
[1:09:26] maybe here there are some people who are
[1:09:27] the holy spirit and there are some
[1:09:28] people who do not
[1:09:29] have the holy spirit but you need to be
[1:09:31] in the spirit of bible study
[1:09:33] you know if you're here and losing it is
[1:09:35] a very clear sign you are not in the
[1:09:37] spirit of that
[1:09:38] that thing so you cannot be blessed at
[1:09:40] all
[1:09:41] even when they ask you what did you
[1:09:42] learn nothing why
[1:09:45] not because you attempted because
[1:09:50] so you even need to be in the spirit
[1:09:54] of receiving the holy ghost for you
[1:09:55] receive the holy ghost
[1:09:57] why do people receive one of us when
[1:09:59] they have our place that others don't
[1:10:00] receive the holy ghost and two years
[1:10:01] later
[1:10:05] in the spirit sometimes you take people
[1:10:07] for baptism
[1:10:08] and then you wanna do they really see
[1:10:11] the importance and the strength of this
[1:10:13] thing
[1:10:13] you know and that's why for me to take
[1:10:16] now i know there are
[1:10:17] about five people here to be baptized
[1:10:19] but i will not force you i'm not even
[1:10:20] demanding
[1:10:21] i'm going to wait for them to come
[1:10:23] pastor where are we going
[1:10:25] you know that shows they are in the
[1:10:28] spirit of going to be
[1:10:31] baptized so whenever they will receive
[1:10:33] the full benefit
[1:10:35] of it you know everything that the god
[1:10:38] promised they will also
[1:10:39] receive it connect was received the holy
[1:10:43] spirit
[1:10:43] sister unfortunate was he baptized yet
[1:10:47] so we found out and i think it's a clear
[1:10:50] sign he's not listening to that
[1:10:53] sharing that someone can receive the
[1:10:55] word of god
[1:10:56] before water it is very very much
[1:10:59] possible
[1:11:01] someone can receive the one of us before
[1:11:07] some of you are doubting me
[1:11:10] and i don't believe that there is a
[1:11:11] family of canadians
[1:11:13] that man received the holy ghost and
[1:11:16] remember he was running as people giving
[1:11:19] he was already the spirit of therapy he
[1:11:22] was in the spirit of
[1:11:23] prayer he was he was doing all these
[1:11:26] things even before he had peter
[1:11:28] preaching
[1:11:30] so because he was in the spirit when
[1:11:31] peter came down
[1:11:33] the man was already in the spirit of the
[1:11:36] one even
[1:11:37] when he began preaching the word the man
[1:11:39] was in the spirit he received the holy
[1:11:41] ghost
[1:11:43] the man started talking dance
[1:11:46] peter was shocked what what just
[1:11:49] happened
[1:11:50] with the brothers
[1:12:20] used to be people who don't even dress
[1:12:22] right yes but now
[1:12:24] you are born in karamoja and you are
[1:12:26] preached
[1:12:27] to hiddens and these people don't even
[1:12:30] rest
[1:12:31] these people don't even know the name of
[1:12:32] jesus and while you are preaching he
[1:12:34] suffered
[1:12:50] this is the first place in the bible
[1:12:52] where i see a pastor stopping people
[1:12:54] when they speak he was like wait just a
[1:12:56] moment brother
[1:12:57] sister stop stop the moment come
[1:13:02] here
[1:13:13] i really doubt that kind of speed which
[1:13:15] even breaks chairs
[1:13:22] you know and yes i might be in the
[1:13:25] spirit
[1:13:27] but in the spirit of dancing
[1:13:30] right i will be the spirit of dancing
[1:13:32] that does not mean i am filled with the
[1:13:34] holy ghost
[1:13:35] i might be anointed and i'm there for me
[1:13:38] in the spirit of
[1:13:39] dancing and then i can dance and dance
[1:13:41] and last
[1:13:43] and then and then as i'm dancing
[1:13:47] i come across a chair you know i'm not
[1:13:50] going to break it because i am in the
[1:13:51] spirit of one
[1:13:53] see i will leave the chair
[1:13:56] even if i'm closing my eyes when i feel
[1:13:58] i'm touching something i just opened my
[1:13:59] eyes you know
[1:14:00] and oh then continue i still do it with
[1:14:03] understanding
[1:14:04] that the apostles said what everything
[1:14:06] we do should do it in the spirit
[1:14:08] and also understand you understand
[1:14:12] so when we are praying we pray with the
[1:14:15] spirit but also we
[1:14:17] understand therefore when we are going
[1:14:19] forward that's all we need to understand
[1:14:22] what it is all about and when you are
[1:14:25] working
[1:14:26] there is nothing by the way there's
[1:14:28] nothing that can hinder you
[1:14:29] to receive your holy spirit as long as
[1:14:31] you believe
[1:14:33] what a baptism is a must for anyone who
[1:14:35] believes
[1:14:36] someone says so if you receive the holy
[1:14:38] spirit before baptism what
[1:14:39] why do you need to be baptized after all
[1:14:41] now it is finished i said oh wait a
[1:14:43] moment if
[1:14:44] what you received was the holy spirit
[1:14:46] the holy spirit is in agreement with his
[1:14:48] wife
[1:14:49] therefore you must go and be what are
[1:14:51] baptized
[1:14:53] yes exactly assigned what he received
[1:14:56] was not the holy spirit it was just
[1:14:58] a spirit but not the holy spirit maybe
[1:15:00] you were excited
[1:15:01] maybe you know but the balaam said all
[1:15:03] those things are impersonated
[1:15:05] but there is one thing that they will
[1:15:07] come up you know what it is you know
[1:15:10] what it is
[1:15:11] someone said the why actually the devil
[1:15:13] also knows the word
[1:15:14] and he even trembles because if you know
[1:15:16] that god is one of the tremble so you
[1:15:18] think you're not a person of the world
[1:15:20] he has made himself the angel of light
[1:15:22] and his ministers the ministers of
[1:15:27] the ministers of darkness brothers
[1:15:35] righteousness hallelujah but but you
[1:15:38] know how about you'll be putting those
[1:15:39] words for us here
[1:15:41] when you speak a quarter you just get it
[1:15:43] he put it here you know
[1:15:45] so he has he is the
[1:15:48] angel maybe you also don't know the
[1:15:50] scriptures we're talking about he's the
[1:15:51] angel
[1:15:53] of darkness but he has made himself the
[1:15:54] angel of life
[1:15:56] and therefore has made his ministers the
[1:15:58] ministers of righteousness
[1:16:01] you know so he doesn't know what so what
[1:16:04] can
[1:16:32] water does not change your stage when
[1:16:35] even the rain of the
[1:16:36] yeah the bible talks about two different
[1:16:38] rains
[1:16:39] the lottery and and the former range
[1:16:44] can you explain the truth brother all
[1:16:48] right can you highlight
[1:16:49] this
[1:16:52] i want someone who can explain what the
[1:16:54] focus it ray is
[1:16:56] and what the latter rain is
[1:16:59] you can who can
[1:17:03] who can rather you can
[1:17:06] i am not you can you can
[1:17:10] oh no one here can oh
[1:17:14] that's the best
[1:17:27] you see why we should read the message
[1:17:29] yes yes even if you see the other
[1:17:31] ministers who put you very well
[1:17:32] you must read the message by yourself
[1:17:34] you must go
[1:17:35] and say to the angel give me the word
[1:17:39] give me that
[1:17:43] you must go to the engine and tell him
[1:17:44] give me the boo give me the right
[1:17:47] that's what job in revelation
[1:17:56] it shows us that we still need to know
[1:17:58] more and more and more and more
[1:18:00] and i think i thought we were going to
[1:18:01] spend only two months or one month on
[1:18:03] this
[1:18:03] chat book but i think we will finish one
[1:18:05] year

[1:18:55] okay verse one read
[1:18:59] revelation chapter three first one are
[1:19:01] you highlighted
[1:19:03] and i saw another
[1:19:18] [Music]
[1:19:35] prayed seven thunders entered their
[1:19:38] voices
[1:19:39] and when the seven canadas had uttered
[1:19:41] their voices i was about to write
[1:19:43] and i had a voice from heaven saying
[1:19:46] that
[1:19:46] we still have those things which they
[1:19:49] say that has attacked
[1:19:50] and write them notes and
[1:19:54] the angel which i saw stand up on the
[1:19:57] sea and upon the uplifted
[1:19:59] up his heart to heaven and sway by him
[1:20:02] that even
[1:20:03] forever and ever who went in heaven and
[1:20:06] the things that
[1:20:06] they are in uh and the earth and the
[1:20:09] things that they are
[1:20:10] in uh and they see and the things
[1:20:14] which are there in that there should be
[1:20:17] time no longer
[1:20:19] but in the days of the voice of the
[1:20:21] seventh angel we shall begin to sound
[1:20:24] the mystery of god
[1:20:25] should be finished that's what's what
[1:20:27] season
[1:20:28] okay go ahead brother
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:45] and the voice which i heard from him and
[1:20:46] speak unto me again and say
[1:20:49] go and take the little book which is
[1:20:52] open in the hand of the angel
[1:20:54] who is standing upon the sea and upon
[1:20:56] the earth and i went and took the angel
[1:20:58] and said
[1:21:13] hand and editor and it was in my mouth
[1:21:16] it has honey and as soon as i had beaten
[1:21:19] it my page was bitter
[1:21:21] and he said unto me now must prophesy
[1:21:24] again before
[1:21:26] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[1:21:29] things
[1:21:32] okay you see sir
[1:21:36] chapter 18 yes
[1:21:55] which standing upon the sea and upon the
[1:21:58] earth
[1:21:59] that's my state
[1:22:01] [Music]
[1:22:04] now i wanted to show you this park
[1:22:08] here that uh
[1:22:13] when the seven thunders out of their
[1:22:15] voices
[1:22:16] and john was about to write
[1:22:20] what did the voice say
[1:22:23] seal them up and write them now
[1:22:27] but when it comes to verse seven what
[1:22:30] happens
[1:22:42] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[1:22:44] angel
[1:22:46] when he begins that's why this ministry
[1:22:49] is called date of the voice in the days
[1:22:52] of the voice of the seventh age when he
[1:22:54] begins to sound
[1:22:55] what will be finished so the mystery of
[1:22:58] god is being finished in the days
[1:23:01] of the voice not in the days of the man
[1:23:04] but in the days of god
[1:23:10] who is the seventh angel
[1:23:14] yes is the last death prophet
[1:23:18] is the seventh messenger because there
[1:23:20] are seven
[1:23:21] ages seven eight messengers so the
[1:23:23] seventh messenger is the prophet of our
[1:23:25] generation
[1:23:26] all right yes and therefore his
[1:23:30] his message is the one
[1:23:33] that is going on now
[1:23:37] on tapes it is recorded on tips
[1:23:41] as our voice
[1:23:44] as ah and the bible says the mystery is
[1:23:47] going to be finished in that day
[1:23:52] can we now agree we are in the days
[1:23:56] of that voice
[1:23:59] we are in the days of the fulfilling of
[1:24:01] the finishing of
[1:24:02] the mystery of god now
[1:24:06] all that mystery of god is here in the
[1:24:08] form of the message but what did he say
[1:24:11] he said verse 8 now
[1:24:17] and the waste which i had from his
[1:24:19] respect and to me again i'd say
[1:24:21] go and take the little book which is
[1:24:24] which is open
[1:24:25] in the hand of the region which standing
[1:24:27] upon this yeah
[1:24:44] [Music]
[1:24:57] is taking the bride who right the bride
[1:25:01] so john was a brother
[1:25:05] right yes in tribulation right so
[1:25:08] john is typing that right so he said
[1:25:10] john take that
[1:25:12] [Applause]
[1:25:19] [Music]
[1:25:25] and that's why we are preaching this
[1:25:26] message into all our hearts
[1:25:28] why we are taking the book hallelujah
[1:25:32] so can i be right now i said john take
[1:25:33] the book
[1:25:35] john take the rule don't take the book
[1:25:38] but the same as
[1:25:54] god bless you what is eating spittle
[1:25:57] speaking
[1:26:00] sister fortunate leave these ones alone
[1:26:03] what is taking the book spiritually
[1:26:06] speaking
[1:26:12] eating usually is hearing and believing
[1:26:16] you can be reading and hearing and
[1:26:18] believing right so when you believe
[1:26:20] something
[1:26:20] it means you have eaten it you
[1:26:23] understand
[1:26:23] yes praise the name of the lord so john
[1:26:26] has taken naboo
[1:26:28] and john now today we are taking that
[1:26:30] book
[1:26:31] and i was going back i wanted to remind
[1:26:33] you of the lottery and the former range
[1:26:36] the former rain is the one that comes
[1:26:40] fast
[1:26:41] and but the banham says that former rain
[1:26:44] i'll ask you
[1:26:45] the former rain is that teaching rain
[1:26:49] is that time when the world is being
[1:26:51] taught
[1:26:52] is that frustrating to come you know
[1:26:55] like
[1:26:55] those of you have ever done some farming
[1:26:57] in the village
[1:26:59] when uh when uh when
[1:27:02] you're going to do funding with your
[1:27:03] blood mage what comes first
[1:27:06] reign that first way is to help you to
[1:27:08] do what
[1:27:10] to prepare the ground and then to sow
[1:27:12] the seed huh yes
[1:27:14] but there is another rain which comes
[1:27:15] when
[1:27:31] so in the same hospital speaking the
[1:27:33] former rain is the uh sowing rain and
[1:27:35] there
[1:27:36] rather rain is the stream so now
[1:27:39] when you arrange spiritually speaking it
[1:27:42] means
[1:27:43] that spirit you know we're talking about
[1:27:45] the spirit huh
[1:27:46] so it means that spirit or the anointing
[1:27:49] right so that is that spirit
[1:27:51] that god sends in or sends out the
[1:27:54] spirit of teaching
[1:27:56] the spirit of teaching and it has come
[1:28:00] through this message of the hour you
[1:28:02] must receive the teaching of the word
[1:28:04] you must be told you must understand
[1:28:07] the mysteries you understand yes that's
[1:28:09] to do with your understanding your
[1:28:11] spirit
[1:28:12] but apart from that there is also the
[1:28:14] latter rain
[1:28:16] that is the outpowering oil
[1:28:20] the holy spirit now the life of that
[1:28:21] white
[1:28:23] when you receive the former rain you are
[1:28:25] receiving the outpouring of that
[1:28:28] of the old street now in the end they
[1:28:30] say
[1:28:31] there shall be both in the every time
[1:28:33] there is a promise that there shall be
[1:28:35] both the former reign and the gallery
[1:28:36] together the child has been told for
[1:28:52] through this message of the year we
[1:28:53] received the vote we received
[1:29:03] we should talk about that in details but
[1:29:05] for now what were we proceeding
[1:29:07] being in being in the spirit so
[1:29:12] i believe that it is a must for all
[1:29:14] children of god
[1:29:16] to be in the spirit
[1:29:19] reasonable amen which part were we
[1:29:24] are that was the choice that we were
[1:29:25] talking about
[1:29:27] oh yes a question okay proceed
[1:29:30] let me see what question you have and
[1:29:32] then if it's something that you can deal
[1:29:34] with now
[1:29:35] deal with it if not we can talk
[1:29:43] [Music]
[1:29:48] can you speak up your voice
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:30:04] [Music]
[1:30:05] was this one who made an idea
[1:30:09] and he told the world that we don't
[1:30:10] watch that
[1:30:13] but at first yeah he had seen the vision
[1:30:16] between
[1:30:18] evening the
[1:30:32] um
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] in a dream where i told him about the
[1:30:50] view let him take recently
[1:30:54] so i'm wondering when you are saying
[1:30:57] that
[1:30:57] when you get into the spirit
[1:31:01] it means you become active
[1:31:04] yes
[1:31:07] so i have that question how come the
[1:31:10] other people
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:13] they brought those dreams in
[1:31:20] okay that's uh that's a good question
[1:31:25] now it might appear and just remain
[1:31:28] there for a moment that
[1:31:30] it might appear that when
[1:31:34] you if i understand your question right
[1:31:36] you are saying that
[1:31:37] i've said that when you use when you
[1:31:39] when you get into the spirit
[1:31:42] actually not getting in the spirit when
[1:31:44] you receive the holy ghost
[1:31:46] that's what i say when you receive the
[1:31:48] holy ghost you become
[1:31:49] an active member of the body
[1:31:53] of jesus christ and now your question is
[1:31:57] that does it mean that
[1:32:01] when you become an active member of the
[1:32:03] body of jesus christ what about the
[1:32:04] others
[1:32:05] who are not members of the body of jesus
[1:32:07] christ
[1:32:08] is that profession what about the others
[1:32:10] who are not
[1:32:11] active members of the body of jesus
[1:32:12] christ yet they dream
[1:32:15] they speak in tongues they
[1:32:18] that's what i told you that all those
[1:32:22] things that the body of christ will
[1:32:26] do the devil can impersonate
[1:32:32] whatever it is that the body of christ
[1:32:34] will do the body
[1:32:36] can impersonate but i was coming to our
[1:32:39] i was saying that it's one
[1:32:40] thing they never cannot impersonate
[1:32:43] what is that and actually that one
[1:32:47] brought
[1:32:47] us all down to the ring and the four
[1:32:50] marines and everything that's what we
[1:32:51] were trying to track
[1:32:53] thing the devil cannot impersonate no
[1:32:56] one knows what it is
[1:32:59] that's exciting yes jesus
[1:33:02] sorry brother the sixth sense
[1:33:06] faith faith is the sixth sense
[1:33:10] so you are telling me that the devil
[1:33:11] cannot explain faith he surely can
[1:33:16] yes you can can you personally that's
[1:33:18] what it means if they if they can
[1:33:20] behave as if they have even more faith
[1:33:22] than us
[1:33:23] you know so impossible doesn't mean they
[1:33:26] have
[1:33:27] impersonation does not mean they have it
[1:33:30] only means they
[1:33:31] again they behave as if they have that
[1:33:34] yet they don't
[1:33:36] i do not say that all these things that
[1:33:38] the body of us does they can do but i
[1:33:40] said they can
[1:33:40] impersonate they will not have the real
[1:33:44] it's just like someone having a fake
[1:33:46] effect
[1:33:47] or not when you have the original one so
[1:33:51] those two different bills or dollar
[1:33:54] bills
[1:33:55] are different completely but the other
[1:33:59] one looks like as if
[1:34:01] it's the original but it is an
[1:34:02] impersonation of
[1:34:05] the origin yes
[1:34:08] exactly so the question is what is it
[1:34:12] that the democratic person is
[1:34:30] love
[1:34:45] sorry oh sister agnes wants to say
[1:34:47] something mr aguiles do you want to say
[1:34:48] something
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:58] yes
[1:35:11] you cannot impersonate the life of
[1:35:13] christ
[1:35:17] amen
[1:35:20] [Laughter]
[1:35:25] [Music]
[1:35:27] if there's one amen that the devil
[1:35:29] cannot impersonate
[1:35:30] is the life hallelujah he can never
[1:35:34] impersonate their lives you will tell
[1:35:37] someone you love them on their mouths
[1:35:38] but you cannot
[1:35:39] really truly love them by your actions
[1:35:41] and you are impersonating
[1:35:44] right yes they won't even say he said he
[1:35:47] loves me but the way
[1:35:48] he looks the life you can't impersonate
[1:35:51] the life
[1:35:57] the words of the flesh are manifest and
[1:36:01] these are
[1:36:02] one two three four and the words of the
[1:36:04] spirit
[1:36:06] hallelujah the words
[1:36:23] yes quickly now
[1:36:29] hallelujah this is a wonderful wonderful
[1:36:32] look at it now
[1:36:39] yes now the rest of the flesh
[1:36:42] we we talked about this on sunday
[1:36:46] uh the ones of the flesh are manifest
[1:36:47] which are these adultery fornication and
[1:36:50] goodness
[1:36:50] lasciviousness excuse me at our tree
[1:36:54] idolatry witchcraft hatred barriers
[1:36:56] emulations wrath
[1:36:58] strife seditions heresies
[1:37:01] endings murders drunkenness revealings
[1:37:03] and such like
[1:37:04] of the which i tell you before as i have
[1:37:08] told you in the time past
[1:37:09] that they which do such things by the
[1:37:13] shape
[1:37:14] the day which do such things
[1:37:18] um
[1:37:31] all of us now
[1:38:01] okay let me ask you a question
[1:38:04] is it possible for a manga tree to look
[1:38:06] like uh
[1:38:08] when it is growing to look like some
[1:38:10] other kind of tree
[1:38:13] you are not good farmers let me ask the
[1:38:15] new farmer
[1:38:16] when you go in the garden and the mango
[1:38:19] tree is planted before it bears fruit
[1:38:21] is that not possible for you to mistake
[1:38:23] it for another tree
[1:38:24] where do you see it from
[1:38:41] the answer is this person
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:50] but is it possible for a person
[1:38:53] even if he's not a good farmer
[1:38:57] to mistake apple
[1:39:02] and uh and what
[1:39:07] yeah i'm talking about apple tree
[1:39:24] is it possible to mistake
[1:39:28] the fruit of the mango tree and the
[1:39:31] fruit of the apartment
[1:39:33] why is it not possible
[1:39:37] because a fruit precisely tells
[1:39:41] what the tree has been
[1:39:44] or what drink and bear and therefore
[1:39:48] that tree or that few will tear what the
[1:39:51] tree has
[1:39:52] inside of it the field will only bring
[1:39:56] out
[1:39:56] the life of us there come on now
[1:40:01] and that's what jesus was saying you
[1:40:02] shall know them by their word
[1:40:06] so you can warn
[1:40:20] everything and that's all good and we
[1:40:22] also have to do it
[1:40:24] we don't have to say that because who
[1:40:26] told you
[1:40:27] it is for us simply because the
[1:40:30] predictions are impersonating it does
[1:40:32] not mean that we
[1:40:33] should not have it among us can you read
[1:40:37] it for me
[1:40:37] give me mark 16. oh man we are even
[1:40:41] veering away from the batman's vision
[1:40:46] all right mark 16.
[1:40:49] mark 16
[1:40:52] mark 16 verse 15
[1:40:57] but what is your life you have your own
[1:40:59] bibles
[1:41:00] because you are going to annoy your
[1:41:01] bible sister can you find your bible
[1:41:04] it's just disappeared like that
[1:41:07] oh my jesus christ
[1:41:12] this is dangerous how can you go to a
[1:41:14] guy without a host
[1:41:16] all right someone read for me all of us
[1:41:25] [Music]
[1:41:30] together
[1:41:44] is
[1:41:56] you say amen and this shall further
[1:42:01] amen in my name they shall cast off
[1:42:03] their voice
[1:42:05] they shall speak with the new terms amen
[1:42:08] so how many of you have spoken with
[1:42:09] mutants
[1:42:12] of you have spoken in a amen time yes i
[1:42:14] understand that all of us may not speak
[1:42:16] in times but how come
[1:42:17] that group of 20 40 no one speaks has
[1:42:21] spoken ever in times
[1:42:25] why the bible says
[1:43:09] church he's afraid but also do not say
[1:43:12] that don't talk in tongues alone when
[1:43:13] you are alone
[1:43:16] so say that when it is in church tell
[1:43:18] them
[1:43:22] otherwise tell them to others and do
[1:43:25] not speak things at all right yes hey
[1:43:28] you people
[1:43:29] hey if it is in the church tell them to
[1:43:33] interpret otherwise tell them to shut up
[1:43:36] and never speak tongues again if they
[1:43:38] can't interpret
[1:43:39] amen
[1:43:44] oh lord amen is this what we have
[1:43:47] preached to you
[1:43:48] god had mercy this is not this is never
[1:43:51] what we preach to you
[1:43:53] he's not even what the table says you
[1:43:56] must know what the bible says
[1:43:57] or else you will take a first look to
[1:43:59] you that's why
[1:44:00] the bible studies like this are very
[1:44:02] important can someone help us right now
[1:44:04] what does
[1:44:11] oh my goodness this is very important i
[1:44:13] cannot believe it like that
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:32] 14.
[1:44:41] okay begin from 19.
[1:44:48] first corinthians chapter 14 bus says
[1:44:52] begin with the verses
[1:45:04] this verse you say that the holy spirit
[1:45:07] well
[1:45:07] the holy spirit the devil can
[1:45:09] impersonate
[1:45:10] that they are they have the spirit but
[1:45:12] really we know that they can never
[1:45:14] receive the true genuine holy spirit and
[1:45:17] uh we also know as we found out that but
[1:45:21] the devil cannot impersonate the life of
[1:45:23] the
[1:45:24] child of god the son of god filled with
[1:45:26] the holy spirit
[1:45:27] that the life the devils are not
[1:45:29] impersonated
[1:45:33] okay brother martin you might just be
[1:45:35] having network problems
[1:45:37] i think because the the signal is pretty
[1:45:40] good here
[1:45:41] all right we're taking so long
[1:45:56] yeah just like that okay
[1:46:02] all right right there okay now i wanted
[1:46:05] to begin
[1:46:10] is wrong with you i told you that's 19.
[1:46:13] yes yeah
[1:46:14] okay can we begin from go a little bit
[1:46:17] up
[1:46:20] okay let us begin
[1:46:25] from
[1:46:28] verses
[1:46:32] [Music]
[1:46:34] six
[1:46:38] verses four
[1:46:42] okay i'm going to have people reading
[1:46:44] one by one
[1:46:46] first brother can you read from there
[1:46:48] all right read from verse four
[1:46:50] when you're tired someone else you take
[1:46:51] it from me
[1:47:08] okay if you can't really find it just
[1:47:09] say it fights all right
[1:47:13] do you understand that first verse yes
[1:47:16] he that speaks the unknown term that's
[1:47:18] what
[1:47:19] what does edifying mean
[1:47:33] [Music]
[1:47:38] but rather that he prophesied for
[1:47:41] greater is he that prophesied
[1:47:43] than he that speaks with dance except he
[1:47:46] interprets that
[1:47:47] the church may receive a defile
[1:47:52] no no what does that mean
[1:48:17] i profit you except i shall speak to you
[1:48:20] either by revelation of my knowledge or
[1:48:23] my prophesy or my doctrine
[1:48:27] continue i didn't think you don't like
[1:48:30] giving sound
[1:48:32] whether by or have except they give a
[1:48:36] distinction in their sounds how shall
[1:48:39] it be know what is piped or how
[1:48:43] if the trumpet given uncertain sounds
[1:48:46] who shall compare himself to them
[1:48:49] meaning sounds have a meaning sounds
[1:48:51] like what
[1:48:52] when a sound is spoken every sound on
[1:48:55] earth by the way has a meaning
[1:48:57] that's right did you know that
[1:49:04] [Music]
[1:49:08] [Applause]
[1:49:13] yes all right continue
[1:49:17] so likewise
[1:49:20] what's easy to be understood
[1:49:24] how shall it be know what is spoken
[1:49:27] split into the air there are
[1:49:31] it may be so many kinds of ways in the
[1:49:34] world
[1:49:35] one of them is without signification
[1:49:37] have you heard
[1:49:38] yes the voices are so many
[1:50:08] i shall be and to him that speaketh a
[1:50:11] barbarian
[1:50:12] and he that speaketh shall be a
[1:50:14] barbarian unto me
[1:50:16] even for as much as he
[1:50:20] uh zealous of spiritual gifts seek that
[1:50:27] in other words if i just speak things
[1:50:29] that you don't know it is like
[1:50:31] as if i'm a chicken or something you
[1:50:33] know something that is weird to you you
[1:50:35] know what
[1:51:03] [Music]
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:18] okay
[1:51:32] my spirit prayed but my understanding is
[1:51:35] unfortunate
[1:51:36] what when i pray listen now church
[1:51:39] we are believers in the message the
[1:51:42] bible says
[1:51:43] if we if i pray in unknown tongue it is
[1:51:46] useless
[1:51:49] please please what
[1:51:52] is it if i pray
[1:51:55] in an unknown tongue it is useless
[1:52:00] my if i pray in unknown time
[1:52:03] it is useless amen
[1:52:07] how dare you say amen to such a
[1:52:09] statement it's not what the bible says
[1:52:11] please already see what the bible says
[1:52:14] if i break in i'm not in an unknown
[1:52:17] tongue
[1:52:18] my spirit prays so in other words you're
[1:52:21] praying you're in the spirit actually
[1:52:23] when you're praying in terms
[1:52:24] you are in the spirit the first time i
[1:52:27] spoke and prayed in tongues
[1:52:29] i felt like i've never felt before
[1:52:33] your spirit right
[1:52:36] but your understanding is you can't
[1:52:39] understand a bit of what you are
[1:52:41] speaking even yourself with speaking it
[1:52:43] unless you know that language or that
[1:52:45] time for that matter
[1:52:47] amen please let us continue on
[1:52:50] all right yes verse 15 what is it today
[1:52:54] i will pray with the spirit and i will
[1:52:56] pray
[1:52:59] i will sing with the spirit and i will
[1:53:02] sing with the understanding also
[1:53:04] yes i will pray with the spirit
[1:53:07] and i will pray with the understanding
[1:53:09] also i will speak with the spirit and i
[1:53:11] will speak
[1:53:12] with the understanding also hallelujah
[1:53:15] so in other words when you pray and you
[1:53:17] don't understand what you are praying
[1:53:19] that's right when you pray and you know
[1:53:21] understanding what you're praying
[1:53:23] it is not helping there
[1:53:27] others he's not helping the others
[1:53:30] there's a reason
[1:53:31] why he's speaking this about support
[1:53:33] there's a reason why he's teaching this
[1:53:34] he's not teaching it as in the context
[1:53:36] of a person he's teaching it
[1:53:38] as in the context of a church coming
[1:53:40] together all right
[1:53:41] so let's let's continue on uh-huh else
[1:53:44] when thou shalt mess with the spirit
[1:53:46] how shall he that occupied the room of
[1:53:49] the
[1:53:50] unland say amen so if you walk in the
[1:54:07] who are in the room and they have not
[1:54:09] understanding of what you are speaking
[1:54:10] there and around
[1:54:11] meaning they have no understanding of
[1:54:13] what you are talking about
[1:54:16] how shall they say amen are they giving
[1:54:17] your friends saying that he understands
[1:54:19] not what that was saying
[1:54:25] [Applause]
[1:54:32] all right read honda
[1:54:36] [Music]
[1:54:48] thanks well yeah but the other is what
[1:54:51] they defined
[1:54:53] okay i thank my god i thank my god i
[1:54:57] speak with dance
[1:54:58] more than not yet wait a moment
[1:55:16] they knew how to speak in terms and by
[1:55:19] the way as we are reading this you must
[1:55:20] know that there are tons of men and
[1:55:22] kinds of angels
[1:55:24] tongues of men is that which is known by
[1:55:26] people already
[1:55:28] times of angels is that which is not
[1:55:30] even known by people
[1:55:31] whereby it's a combination of words
[1:55:32] every sound has a meaning right
[1:55:34] but there is a combination of sounds
[1:55:36] that is not known
[1:55:38] by any human being on earth
[1:55:41] so when the spirit of what comes on you
[1:55:43] you can either speak a language a time
[1:55:45] that
[1:55:46] is known you for example speaking
[1:55:48] chinese
[1:55:50] it can be me speaking ethiopian language
[1:55:53] how perfect sometimes when we are
[1:55:54] preaching in ethiopia
[1:55:55] and the holy spirit comes with me and we
[1:55:57] are preaching someone and i feel the
[1:55:59] other person is not bringing the point
[1:56:00] sometimes it strikes me so hard that i
[1:56:03] can take a minute or two explaining to
[1:56:05] someone in america and i'm not good in
[1:56:06] america at all
[1:56:08] so that i called it i was speaking
[1:56:10] intense to me
[1:56:11] because i didn't understand but to them
[1:56:13] they understood that's how it was on the
[1:56:15] earth pentecost
[1:56:16] they spoke the tongues of the people so
[1:56:19] that they can preach them baptism in
[1:56:20] jesus name
[1:56:21] and those people did not understand the
[1:56:23] language of these people and these ones
[1:56:24] didn't understand the language of those
[1:56:25] people
[1:56:26] that's how it was those were kinds of
[1:56:28] men
[1:56:29] and when when paul says i speak in times
[1:56:31] with more than you all
[1:56:32] maybe he means their own times all the
[1:56:35] times of men
[1:56:36] because paul was a very well-traveled
[1:56:38] man he had traveled many places
[1:56:40] and he knew many languages all over the
[1:56:41] world right it was among the romans it
[1:56:43] was among the
[1:56:44] the jews you understand yes but also you
[1:56:46] could have received some words of the
[1:56:48] spirit
[1:56:48] whereby you could speak languages or
[1:56:51] tongues that are tongues of
[1:56:53] the spirit are you following me yes okay
[1:56:56] so when we talk about times how about
[1:56:58] your money tango the spirit
[1:57:00] and times are rather tongues of men and
[1:57:03] tons of angels
[1:57:04] there's another verse that speaks of
[1:57:05] that okay read verse 19
[1:57:08] yet in the church i had rather speak
[1:57:10] five words with my understanding
[1:57:15] that by my voice i might teach others
[1:57:18] also than ten thousand words in an
[1:57:22] unknown term hallelujah he says yet when
[1:57:26] i
[1:57:26] am in the church i would rather speak
[1:57:28] fine words
[1:57:30] with my understanding i rather speak
[1:57:31] foreign
[1:57:33] i can understand which means in here it
[1:57:36] is also possible
[1:57:36] who was knowing many times god was
[1:57:39] speaking times more than everybody else
[1:57:41] tons of ages perhaps
[1:57:42] times which he never knew all right he
[1:57:44] was speaking times
[1:57:46] amen that he himself would not work
[1:57:48] could not even understand
[1:57:50] but he's saying here yet in the chat i
[1:57:52] would rather speak
[1:57:55] five words with understanding
[1:57:58] than speak ten thousand
[1:58:03] in an unknown term come and breathe
[1:58:06] whether it
[1:58:07] be no children in an in understanding
[1:58:10] how be it in my
[1:58:14] children but in understanding demand
[1:58:18] but in understanding be men continue
[1:58:21] brother
[1:58:22] in their law it is written with men of
[1:58:25] other tongues
[1:58:26] and other lips where i speak to these
[1:58:29] people
[1:58:30] and yet for all that will they not hear
[1:58:33] me
[1:58:34] say the lord hallelujah
[1:58:38] who is going to speak in other times
[1:58:42] come on answer me now
[1:58:46] what's with the two everyone now one two
[1:58:48] three four
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:14] in other words
[1:59:18] and i speak your tongue your language
[1:59:22] you will say hey this must be good you
[1:59:24] you even speaking my language
[1:59:26] like it was on a new pentagon but if you
[1:59:29] don't you do believe all i need to do is
[1:59:31] to prophesy
[1:59:31] you know like the nature of the gift
[1:59:34] which
[1:59:35] sometimes all the times but sometimes
[1:59:36] once in a long way that
[1:59:38] operates through me i notice it is only
[1:59:40] for believers
[1:59:42] even if the world just came upon me and
[1:59:44] they prophesied someone who is working
[1:59:45] on the regulars
[1:59:46] look at this one maybe someone told him
[1:59:48] about my life or something
[1:59:50] they will not work
[1:59:53] discernment prophecy and all that kind
[1:59:55] of thing what's only for
[1:59:58] believers verse number three
[2:00:02] if they are if therefore the whole
[2:00:04] church we come together into one place
[2:00:07] and all speak with turns and there comes
[2:00:10] those that are unlearned oh
[2:00:13] and believers will they don't say that
[2:00:17] they are smart they
[2:00:18] are mad
[2:00:21] but if all prophecy and they are come in
[2:00:24] one that
[2:00:39] and thus are the secrets of his heart
[2:00:41] made manifest
[2:00:43] and so say falling down on his face
[2:00:46] he will worship good and report that god
[2:00:49] is
[2:00:49] in you of the truth
[2:00:53] okay now i will take it out from there
[2:00:55] now
[2:00:57] praise the lord amen thank you brother
[2:01:00] thank you okay now that's what
[2:01:06] you finished verse 26 how is it there
[2:01:09] brethren
[2:01:10] please don't sleep on me now how is it
[2:01:12] brethren
[2:01:13] when you come together every one of you
[2:01:15] has assam has a doctrine
[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:48] teaching a teaching like our teaching on
[2:01:53] one god are teaching what a baptism are
[2:01:55] teaching on you know
[2:01:56] but there are teachings that the
[2:01:57] apostles that is the true doctrine
[2:02:00] the teachings that they work the
[2:02:03] nation's ring that is not in the one
[2:02:05] those are
[2:02:07] doctrines of men wrong doctrines okay
[2:02:09] okay when we say attack so do you see
[2:02:11] that also a tongue
[2:02:12] should also be accepted in the church
[2:02:15] please don't take it out
[2:02:16] yes don't try to stop realizing the
[2:02:19] message many people think time is
[2:02:21] demonic
[2:02:22] please is part of the move of the holy
[2:02:26] spirit
[2:02:28] [Music]
[2:02:30] has
[2:02:37] so revelation is not necessarily a
[2:02:39] teaching or or you're not going to stand
[2:02:40] on the proof
[2:02:41] to give your teachings
[2:02:45] but you are going to give your
[2:02:46] revelation so how are you going to give
[2:02:47] your revelation
[2:02:51] do you understand that relationship can
[2:02:52] also come to a sister
[2:02:56] so how will she give
[2:03:13] psalm is a song all right
[2:03:16] but a revelation is not a song
[2:03:21] and revelation is our
[2:03:25] is our come on now
[2:03:30] a revelation is a prophetic
[2:03:34] insight
[2:03:37] something prophetic are you following me
[2:03:40] yes brother are you i understand
[2:03:43] what i'm saying a revolution
[2:03:48] there is uh some time we were praying
[2:03:50] here
[2:03:52] i don't know if you were part of that
[2:03:53] meeting but some people are part of that
[2:03:55] meeting
[2:03:56] where god gave several revelations to
[2:03:59] people
[2:04:00] how many were there that service raise
[2:04:02] up your mind
[2:04:05] okay one two three four five okay a few
[2:04:10] do you who who received that i mentioned
[2:04:12] about their life that day
[2:04:15] you okay you you are one of them
[2:04:19] was it true now a revolution sometimes
[2:04:23] it's about something
[2:04:24] what someone has done or is thinking
[2:04:27] or is about to happen to them it might
[2:04:30] be something that they know
[2:04:31] or something that they do not know if
[2:04:33] it's something they do not know the lord
[2:04:35] is telling them what is going to happen
[2:04:36] we understand
[2:04:37] but if it's about something that you
[2:04:38] know it's about something that's already
[2:04:40] going on in their life and maybe
[2:04:41] if it comes to others it may mean
[2:04:43] nothing but to them
[2:04:44] it may mean something that no one knows
[2:04:46] but they no it might be something about
[2:04:49] your thoughts
[2:04:49] and the lord gives you a revolution
[2:04:51] maybe what you're thinking about blah
[2:04:52] blah blah blah
[2:04:54] blah blah blah blah you understand yes
[2:04:56] so that day
[2:04:58] you see the revelation you said it was
[2:05:00] true someone else you did
[2:05:02] was it what was it did it make sense to
[2:05:05] you
[2:05:06] i don't know what revelation that you
[2:05:08] received was it true
[2:05:09] who else you did who else
[2:05:13] now that yeah someone else here is
[2:05:18] actually my wife too you remember that i
[2:05:19] i had to move my wife
[2:05:21] away from here because the holy spirit
[2:05:23] was giving me revelation about her life
[2:05:25] and i did not know what it was going to
[2:05:26] be
[2:05:27] what kind of nature it was going to get
[2:05:28] anywhere in a mixed mixed
[2:05:30] congregation here so we have to take
[2:05:34] because my heart was pounding with the
[2:05:36] revelation that god had revealed to me
[2:05:37] about her right
[2:05:38] and so when i took her there i you know
[2:05:40] started giving her everything and
[2:05:42] and she raised up my hand which means it
[2:05:44] was also true
[2:05:45] now all these revelations about their
[2:05:47] life
[2:05:48] but i never knew anything about what
[2:05:50] they were thinking okay
[2:05:52] i might not dispute but i know i cannot
[2:05:53] know what they were thinking just like
[2:05:55] in other places sometimes
[2:05:56] actually there was even a time brother
[2:05:59] uh
[2:06:00] you know you know god gave me a
[2:06:01] revolution as i was one day i bought a
[2:06:03] minister in the u.s
[2:06:04] america is ways away another in kenya
[2:06:08] you understand this is i'm going to give
[2:06:10] you my testimony but
[2:06:11] i'm sure if you two have a gift you can
[2:06:14] give this one about
[2:06:15] that what god has done through that gift
[2:06:17] now remember a relationship
[2:06:19] is prophetic okay let us continue with
[2:06:22] that scripture by the shame
[2:06:23] so our revelation is prophetic and when
[2:06:25] it comes
[2:06:27] it is not a song when it comes it's not
[2:06:30] about tree
[2:06:32] okay it's not going to say now in the
[2:06:34] book of psalms it says
[2:06:36] if it's a process it should be direct
[2:06:38] what's your name
[2:06:40] blah blah blah blah blah blah everything
[2:06:42] right right like that
[2:06:44] not you know saying you know you know
[2:06:47] in the name of jesus according to the
[2:06:48] book of psalms you know
[2:06:50] it says repent only people someone sent
[2:06:52] me to repent no
[2:06:54] it comes as an inspiration directly
[2:06:58] to you it's not adultery you understand
[2:07:01] okay
[2:07:01] all right i think uh we're not learning
[2:07:04] gifts generally so i just wanted to
[2:07:06] bring in that okay
[2:07:07] has an interpretation now
[2:07:10] interpretation is suddenly coming to
[2:07:12] help out
[2:07:13] on the tangent issue wait don't
[2:07:17] highlight anything that i've not reached
[2:07:19] okay but he says let all things be done
[2:07:22] recently
[2:07:23] okay let all things be done
[2:07:28] now since here is the moment that i
[2:07:30] wanted now
[2:07:31] we have seen can you question that
[2:07:33] change we have seen
[2:07:35] that this gift of times
[2:07:39] should be accepted in the church but
[2:07:42] this gift of times
[2:07:44] should be meant to edify the
[2:07:47] church but remember the interpret the
[2:07:51] interpreting part
[2:07:52] wherein he talked about he's talking
[2:07:54] about it when we are in a place like
[2:07:56] this
[2:07:57] when we are all together okay but when
[2:08:00] someone prays in tongues
[2:08:01] his spirit also prayed he defies his
[2:08:04] spirit but he doesn't
[2:08:06] understand anything but he defies these
[2:08:08] spirits of someone might as well pray
[2:08:10] times are on but when it comes to the
[2:08:12] church
[2:08:13] there must be there must be
[2:08:17] interpretation for the finding of the
[2:08:20] church
[2:08:21] okay that's what the seven i'm going to
[2:08:22] ask you questions after i'm done with
[2:08:23] this teaching okay verse 27
[2:08:25] all of us together now if every man
[2:08:27] speak in
[2:08:28] an unknown time let it be by two or
[2:08:31] at the most by three and that by course
[2:08:34] let one in that print so we are in a
[2:08:36] church
[2:08:38] sister franklin raises up speaks in
[2:08:39] terms
[2:08:41] she either interprets or someone else
[2:08:43] interprets
[2:08:45] if someone else also sees a revelation
[2:08:47] and speaks someone essential priest
[2:08:50] maximum one mom another in the prince
[2:08:53] that's done that's in the church now
[2:08:57] and that usually that's what we preach
[2:08:58] and we stop there
[2:08:59] [Music]
[2:09:01] that means that if someone else speaks
[2:09:04] they're out of order
[2:09:05] it doesn't mean it's not god's message
[2:09:07] but they are out of order why they are
[2:09:08] not able
[2:09:09] to be ordinary not the gift
[2:09:13] but the people gifts of the prophets are
[2:09:16] subject to the prophets
[2:09:19] okay verse number seven
[2:09:23] oh vasquez
[2:09:44] amen all right hey you people don't
[2:09:48] i need nothing to speak maybe i'll just
[2:09:50] apply the physical sticks
[2:09:52] but if they have been you know in that
[2:09:54] preacher this person is speaking in
[2:09:55] times and he's later created
[2:09:57] let him never speak turns again
[2:10:13] so if there is no interpreter and the
[2:10:16] person is speaking in the church
[2:10:18] and he cannot interpret and there is no
[2:10:20] interpreter
[2:10:22] he should be told not to speak in the
[2:10:23] church
[2:10:26] again
[2:10:31] [Music]
[2:10:39] the bible says to pray
[2:10:42] where's that verse can we get that verse
[2:10:45] where he says that he should be taught
[2:10:46] to pray
[2:10:48] before we shall come back to this one
[2:10:49] but i want the other one fast where is
[2:10:52] he
[2:10:53] let him pray that he may either preach
[2:10:58] come on now it's right there brother
[2:11:00] just go back up
[2:11:03] i want to finish up this issue of the
[2:11:05] times because i realized that many of
[2:11:07] you didn't have
[2:11:08] proper understanding of it okay
[2:11:15] verse 30 that is
[2:11:18] what that what happened okay
[2:11:24] god bless you for joining in uh
[2:11:28] all right verse 13 he says wherefore let
[2:11:30] him
[2:11:31] speak it in an unknown tongue pray
[2:11:34] [Music]
[2:11:36] so
[2:11:48] now remember this one is in the context
[2:11:50] of the white
[2:11:52] of the church are you following me yes
[2:11:54] so in the church
[2:11:56] and there is no interpreter then let
[2:11:59] that butter do what
[2:12:01] let that bother you
[2:12:04] please read what the bible says let that
[2:12:07] brother
[2:12:08] keep silent in the church
[2:12:13] don't be fast let that brother be silent
[2:12:17] in the church because there is no reason
[2:12:20] why you are talking times when
[2:12:21] those times cannot be interpreted you
[2:12:24] should speak terms which are going to be
[2:12:26] interpreted and it should fight the
[2:12:29] church you understand
[2:12:31] yes but now i've spoken today and that
[2:12:33] was in the prayer tomorrow
[2:12:35] then there's going to be what should i
[2:12:37] be advised to do
[2:12:40] why should i be advised to do saints
[2:12:44] to pray that i may have
[2:12:46] [Music]
[2:13:00] forever
[2:13:10] have no meaning if they're spoken in the
[2:13:12] church it's just like you're giving a
[2:13:13] testimony in english when no one is
[2:13:15] understanding english in the church
[2:13:17] it should be interpreted your testimony
[2:13:19] is good right
[2:13:20] but no one's understanding it's not
[2:13:21] making sense
[2:13:23] all right now and then you should be
[2:13:26] told
[2:13:27] you should be part in the church and
[2:13:29] even when you go at home you must never
[2:13:32] pray with thanks anymore amen
[2:13:35] amen amen
[2:13:38] hey brother buddy
[2:13:42] is that me you should be trying that you
[2:13:45] should not speak in times
[2:13:46] in the church and also when you go at
[2:13:48] home and anywhere you are
[2:13:50] you must always hold your face because
[2:13:51] you are not in that really ghost time so
[2:13:53] brother sister
[2:13:54] keep science don't drop hands amen
[2:13:57] [Music]
[2:14:18] speak to himself
[2:14:30] which means you are not there you don't
[2:14:32] have interpretation right
[2:14:33] so how many are spoken to themselves and
[2:14:34] people when they're in their prayer
[2:14:36] services
[2:14:37] oh when your prayer closes ah i mean
[2:14:41] you've spoken thanks
[2:14:42] all right to yourself unto god
[2:14:46] wow wonderful praise the lord
[2:14:49] we have one here where's
[2:14:53] how another one we here we're almost
[2:14:54] twenty and only one person president
[2:14:56] are we spiritual
[2:15:00] yeah look
[2:15:06] allow to give the brother all these
[2:15:08] gifts they don't belong to the devil
[2:15:10] they belong to the children of god
[2:15:12] that's why they are in the bible
[2:15:13] therefore you pass arrest them because
[2:15:14] the devil fascinated the
[2:15:16] the the money does not mean that we
[2:15:18] should allow him to take all the money
[2:15:27] [Laughter]
[2:15:32] simply because money is misused out
[2:15:34] there does it mean
[2:15:36] i should be humble i should get children
[2:15:39] i should use the trade only because
[2:15:41] money is evil
[2:15:42] money is not evil
[2:15:47] very good very good one if you have not
[2:15:50] seen it find it
[2:15:52] if you want it you can ask i will give
[2:15:53] it to you only that you may not
[2:15:55] understand his english very well
[2:15:58] but he talked about three users of man
[2:16:00] he said okay the summer title is the use
[2:16:02] of money
[2:16:02] and he was saying that he read the
[2:16:04] scripture right about oh i'm not going
[2:16:05] to go now into the desert
[2:16:07] i will grant you to that but my point
[2:16:09] was
[2:16:10] that we sometimes demonize
[2:16:13] the things from god simply because they
[2:16:15] are misused outside
[2:16:18] you do not demonize money because you
[2:16:20] misuse the outside
[2:16:23] god can use money bless your life and
[2:16:26] for you to place
[2:16:27] many other people's minds and for you to
[2:16:28] start game right
[2:16:30] and also the devil will give it to his
[2:16:33] children to misuse it and they will
[2:16:35] use it to do other bad things so the
[2:16:37] devil
[2:16:38] has made these people misuse that
[2:16:40] actually some of them even train samples
[2:16:42] how to speak times
[2:16:44] they train huh
[2:16:47] can we have children please can you be
[2:16:49] quiet if you can't be quiet
[2:16:51] you with another one so
[2:16:54] excuse me so we find out that even
[2:16:58] times can be used not only to edify the
[2:17:01] church
[2:17:02] but to bless us if
[2:17:05] don't worry about fear of strict terms
[2:17:07] because you can't interpret
[2:17:09] when you are wrong and you feel the
[2:17:11] anointing you know sometimes you know
[2:17:13] when
[2:17:13] i would preach you'd say oh i feel like
[2:17:15] speaking in tongues and he wouldn't
[2:17:16] speak it
[2:17:18] because maybe he's not giving he knows
[2:17:19] he doesn't give you that prayer
[2:17:21] but are you there when he's in his
[2:17:22] prayer closet
[2:17:24] maybe when you go there you call him a
[2:17:26] pentecostal
[2:17:28] so friend don't think don't give it to
[2:17:30] peter questions
[2:17:31] believers speak times and repeat with me
[2:17:35] believers speak times don't begin saying
[2:17:39] this is a believer's
[2:17:41] thing hallelujah to an extended
[2:17:44] unbelievers when they hear that
[2:17:46] this after the question who told you
[2:17:47] that believes that for better prospects
[2:17:50] he said that we speak with neutrons
[2:17:53] and here you say he said your son shall
[2:17:56] follow there
[2:17:57] that happened
[2:18:00] let me read in my name
[2:18:07] with the new times not random english
[2:18:10] they shall speak
[2:18:11] in new times and if they drink
[2:18:15] they live in the child they shall take
[2:18:17] up suffers and they do not
[2:18:19] hurt them hallelujah so friends
[2:18:23] from today i want you to be open-minded
[2:18:25] whatever the holy spirit will let you do
[2:18:27] maybe you've got to be praying alone and
[2:18:29] you feel like something is coming and
[2:18:30] you don't understand it
[2:18:31] let it out and see what will happen
[2:18:34] the day speaking times will come and
[2:18:36] give me a decimal and say you know what
[2:18:37] i felt like i've never felt before
[2:18:40] and who knows the lord the lord will
[2:18:42] train you that word
[2:18:44] that you will be able to speak those
[2:18:45] things in the church and give the
[2:18:47] interpretation of someone else give the
[2:18:48] interpretation
[2:18:49] and those times will be a blessing to us
[2:18:51] hallelujah
[2:18:52] there is a brother and he attends
[2:18:54] service with us here
[2:18:55] on zoom i don't think he's here now uh
[2:18:59] you've heard me talk about him many
[2:19:00] times his name is charon
[2:19:03] this brother believed in one of our
[2:19:04] meetings at brother peter's church in
[2:19:07] kenya and uh in one of those meetings
[2:19:11] there
[2:19:12] uh i i i wasn't actually
[2:19:16] in knowing that he was it was him but i
[2:19:18] came because he was also
[2:19:27] preaching and then this brother came up
[2:19:30] and he was so much and waited
[2:19:32] and he started to speak in tongues
[2:19:35] and as he spoke in times
[2:19:38] you know uh the holy spirit came on me
[2:19:42] so heavily
[2:19:43] there was an immense move of the word
[2:19:46] speaking that church
[2:19:47] at that time everybody was quiet and
[2:19:49] groaning in the spirit of running you
[2:19:51] know but but the bible says that
[2:19:52] sometimes
[2:19:52] their spirit comes to us that you can't
[2:19:55] even
[2:19:56] you know what is that those are even
[2:19:58] times you know i don't know if that's
[2:20:00] ever come to you
[2:20:07] [Music]
[2:20:14] yes so that's how the chat was that kind
[2:20:17] of
[2:20:18] breeze of the holy spirit and then it
[2:20:20] was today and nobody was so heavy
[2:20:22] and then he had finished preaching and
[2:20:24] he was talking about the seven seals and
[2:20:25] then
[2:20:28] this brother was there at the outer
[2:20:31] praying and
[2:20:32] praying and he was just bowing down
[2:20:34] there and then
[2:20:36] the body was fell on him and he stood
[2:20:37] down and speak me in times
[2:20:40] he spoke for like one minute
[2:20:51] and then in a moment you know as
[2:20:54] he was finishing like this i i just
[2:20:57] failed to move forward and give the
[2:20:59] interpretation i was about to pass force
[2:21:00] with the interpretation i can even
[2:21:02] at that moment still remember the three
[2:21:04] or two words i was going to speak out
[2:21:05] first
[2:21:07] and before i added those words
[2:21:10] out then there's another brother you
[2:21:13] know who
[2:21:13] was playing with the kid the guitar he
[2:21:15] was hiding in the playing slowly and
[2:21:17] then he stood up before i did
[2:21:19] and then he took up his rocket guitar
[2:21:22] in the sky or whatever and he started
[2:21:45] yelling crying oh my tell me you talk
[2:21:48] about the anointing of the holy ghost
[2:21:50] talk about the anointing of the holy
[2:21:52] ghost was a meeting
[2:21:55] and you know what i should fall and i
[2:21:58] gave the test that
[2:21:58] the testimony i told them brethren this
[2:22:00] is gone
[2:22:02] i told the church i was just about to
[2:22:03] give the interpretation and this brother
[2:22:05] gave the exactly that person i was going
[2:22:07] to give
[2:22:07] and i told the people that i am now
[2:22:10] another witness and the bible says by
[2:22:12] the word of two or three witnesses i
[2:22:13] watched the best of this do you remember
[2:22:15] that moment
[2:22:16] he was there he was there so friends you
[2:22:19] also despise
[2:22:20] the gifts of god each of you must know
[2:22:22] what part of that body you are
[2:22:24] praise the lord okay we went so far we
[2:22:27] went so far
[2:22:28] i don't know whether we shall be able to
[2:22:29] go back where we stopped
[2:22:32] or maybe we just closed where
[2:22:35] have we been we have we only have about
[2:22:37] a few minutes where have we been where
[2:22:39] are we going to get here
[2:22:40] can someone help me find me
[2:22:44] god bless you we were right there we're
[2:22:46] talking about
[2:22:48] getting into getting into that spirit
[2:22:51] so friends maybe the holy spirit wanted
[2:22:53] us to get to well as far as this
[2:22:56] because you have to get into the spirit
[2:22:58] even short times you have to get into
[2:22:59] the spirit of talking times
[2:23:01] even to say the obligation to the spirit
[2:23:03] of i'm saying
[2:23:05] when we get into the spirit of singing
[2:23:06] you will notice that people who sing as
[2:23:08] if they are all the people they will no
[2:23:09] longer sing like that in you
[2:23:11] they will now sing with video strength
[2:23:13] and you understand ah
[2:23:14] once we are done with ourselves i'll put
[2:23:16] for you some services of some other
[2:23:18] believers
[2:23:19] and you'll see how they worship the
[2:23:20] world and you feel like oh god i just
[2:23:22] want to
[2:23:22] watch it like the others because if we
[2:23:24] are going in the same heaven
[2:23:26] i wonder if others should act another
[2:23:27] way and we also should act another way
[2:23:30] you know unless we act the same way then
[2:23:32] we can now celebrate
[2:23:33] the same heaven
[2:23:39] yes you have a question because
[2:23:42] if you never can personally yes i
[2:23:58] it's possible that never can impersonate
[2:24:00] the one
[2:24:02] but and impersonate
[2:24:05] the life of christ what's the difference
[2:24:08] between the life of christ and the one
[2:24:11] okay when we said a word
[2:24:15] we made a written word we made a written
[2:24:19] word
[2:24:19] and jesus when he was here on earth that
[2:24:22] here is how i can be able to explain for
[2:24:24] you the difference
[2:24:25] between the life of jesus christ and the
[2:24:27] one
[2:24:28] when jesus was on earth here is what he
[2:24:31] said
[2:24:32] he said that if you don't believe that i
[2:24:36] am he
[2:24:37] you will die come on help me now
[2:24:43] if you don't believe that i'm here you
[2:24:46] will die in your sins
[2:24:49] what was it trying to say he was trying
[2:24:52] to show them
[2:24:53] that he was the word but now made
[2:24:57] manifest because remember we have the
[2:24:59] word
[2:25:03] that is not yet manifested and a word
[2:25:07] that is manifest now we have the written
[2:25:10] word
[2:25:11] and we have the written letter of the
[2:25:13] spoken word
[2:25:14] and the manifested word now
[2:25:17] jesus christ he was already in the
[2:25:20] written word
[2:25:21] the books the scrolls which they had and
[2:25:23] to ask
[2:25:24] a son is given a child is given
[2:25:28] a government shall be upon his shot as
[2:25:29] isaiah 96 right
[2:25:31] that was the word also but that work
[2:25:35] was not yet manifest and that one was
[2:25:38] speaking up
[2:25:39] of jesus the same jesus who was now
[2:25:41] before them
[2:25:42] they believed the written one but they
[2:25:45] never
[2:25:45] believed they manifested anyone and
[2:25:48] refusing to believe the manifested word
[2:25:50] is automatically disqualifies you as a
[2:25:52] believer
[2:25:54] that's why jesus has told them search
[2:25:57] the scriptures so in them you think you
[2:26:00] would have been like meaning you cannot
[2:26:02] receive eternal life from those
[2:26:03] scriptures
[2:26:04] if you reject me the manifested one in
[2:26:08] this hour
[2:26:10] that's why when we talk about the blood
[2:26:12] of jesus and by the bananas use these
[2:26:14] phrases maybe
[2:26:15] you will now understand them when he say
[2:26:18] the bleeding one have you read that
[2:26:20] before
[2:26:23] yes you see what does this mean can we
[2:26:25] now say that
[2:26:26] the the word is bleeding is you're
[2:26:28] carrying all of each of your bibles
[2:26:30] please are they bleeding so what does it
[2:26:33] mean by the believing one
[2:26:37] huh
[2:26:41] listen to this in the invisible union of
[2:26:43] the body of christ
[2:26:45] what is sin sin is unbelief
[2:26:58] amen standing ready
[2:27:01] think your gum is washed by the water of
[2:27:03] the bleeding
[2:27:05] one the word become blood
[2:27:09] the word bled for you and you are washed
[2:27:13] in bleeding word the word
[2:27:16] believing the life of god in the word
[2:27:19] and the word was bled
[2:27:21] for you that you might be watched from
[2:27:23] the future of god's prostitutes and be
[2:27:24] cleaned and sanctified by the washing of
[2:27:26] the water by the
[2:27:27] way that makes your mind and the heart
[2:27:29] stay on god
[2:27:30] and on his wow now what's the bleeding
[2:27:33] one
[2:27:35] jesus christ was here and he bleeded of
[2:27:38] course on the cross
[2:27:40] that was the word bleeding right
[2:27:43] yes but that word has been bleeding
[2:27:46] since that time until today
[2:27:49] how meaning that one is fresh
[2:27:53] in every generation so what is the
[2:27:56] breeding word in every generation
[2:27:58] what's the breeding word of this day
[2:28:00] it's the word of the hour
[2:28:03] the french word the french revelation of
[2:28:05] god that is sent
[2:28:07] by the messenger of that generation
[2:28:09] because there were seven stars in the
[2:28:10] hands of jesus by the messenger
[2:28:13] of that generation that word it makes
[2:28:16] that
[2:28:16] word to bleed again in that generation
[2:28:18] for our salvation
[2:28:20] if we reject that word of the hour it we
[2:28:23] are as good as dead
[2:28:25] you remember he said that if you stay
[2:28:27] under that word
[2:28:28] if you stay under the arata revelation
[2:28:30] striking after
[2:28:31] revelation you must receive the holy
[2:28:33] ghost why
[2:28:35] because that word is no longer just the
[2:28:37] one it's just it's the bleeding one
[2:28:39] it's not like the pentecostals are
[2:28:40] preaching it's the bleeding one
[2:28:43] that we are receiving in this generation
[2:28:45] which is the
[2:28:46] revelation of the word of god in this
[2:28:48] hour of believing
[2:28:50] like the power of noah that one was the
[2:28:53] believing one of that time
[2:28:55] never received what laura said had
[2:28:58] received the bleeding one at that time
[2:29:00] paul eating one he's what he's messing
[2:29:03] with the bleeding one
[2:29:04] all down all through the edges there was
[2:29:06] the breeding wonderful generations now
[2:29:08] today
[2:29:09] we have the bleeding one others can
[2:29:12] receive it but they are only receiving
[2:29:13] the bible they do
[2:29:14] give it to me they are receiving a book
[2:29:16] but it is not greedy
[2:29:18] but for us we have received not only the
[2:29:21] word but
[2:29:22] the believing what because it has life
[2:29:24] in it
[2:29:25] if there is no blood upon that word it
[2:29:28] has no
[2:29:29] life to save the only power that can say
[2:29:33] is that black upon that word which has
[2:29:35] been powered out in our generation
[2:29:37] so every nation will have that word so
[2:29:40] rather in conclusion to your question
[2:29:42] that is going to be written there is
[2:29:43] written word and spoken word or
[2:29:46] rather a written word and a manifested
[2:29:48] one the one which is in the book
[2:29:51] and the one which is made manifest so
[2:29:54] you can you can believe that
[2:29:55] you can have you can believe everything
[2:29:57] you you want to you cannot recover from
[2:29:58] from there from the
[2:30:00] genesis revelation you can know
[2:30:02] everything from episode
[2:30:03] but that doesn't give you the holiness
[2:30:05] that doesn't give you eternal life
[2:30:06] so in other words you must have the life
[2:30:09] of the giver
[2:30:10] the life is the holy ghost not just the
[2:30:12] knowledge of it
[2:30:13] but the life of it because there are
[2:30:16] some people who even preach
[2:30:17] you know when you receive the message
[2:30:19] you have received when it goes no
[2:30:23] when you he said when you receive the
[2:30:25] word you are entitled
[2:30:27] to receive it it doesn't mean you have
[2:30:29] automatically received it
[2:30:31] when when paul came to them he said that
[2:30:34] in revelation chapter 19 what did he
[2:30:36] tell them
[2:30:44] yes
[2:30:46] [Music]
[2:30:58] since my brother says
[2:31:01] you believe what does it mean that when
[2:31:04] you believe that you receive the
[2:31:05] holocaust
[2:31:07] when you really believe that you are
[2:31:09] believers huh
[2:31:10] do you have a belief
[2:31:22] so in other words you can receive the
[2:31:23] word but not received
[2:31:25] the one that goes is the life of the
[2:31:26] world there is a there is a
[2:31:28] uh there is a the dynamics and
[2:31:33] the mechanics the mechanics is what
[2:31:36] the understanding of the scriptures what
[2:31:38] we are doing now this one
[2:31:39] agrees with this one and this one and
[2:31:42] even here you understand yes
[2:31:43] we are studying but that is only
[2:31:44] mechanics it doesn't give you life
[2:31:48] until you have mechanics you get into
[2:31:49] the spirit of the mechanics
[2:31:52] because the spirit with which the
[2:31:54] mechanics for the teaching or the
[2:31:55] understanding of the one that comes is
[2:31:57] also the holy spirit
[2:31:59] and that word will then bring and make
[2:32:02] you
[2:32:03] as soon as you enter into the spirit of
[2:32:05] it you will receive the life of it now
[2:32:08] the life is the holy spirit which the
[2:32:10] bible says you are whereby you are
[2:32:11] sealed
[2:32:12] until the day of your redemption and
[2:32:15] there are many believers who are not
[2:32:16] going to receive the holy ghost and they
[2:32:17] will remain
[2:32:18] going in what
[2:32:22] in the tribulation why did why did the
[2:32:24] fridge is going
[2:32:25] in in heaven
[2:32:34] it's not only about many good people
[2:32:37] even if you're a good person
[2:32:38] and you believe the message it's not
[2:32:40] enough you must receive that life
[2:32:43] you must receive the holy spirit it's a
[2:32:45] must
[2:32:46] if you don't receive that holy spirit
[2:32:48] you will not know when the rapture
[2:32:50] when the rapture trumpet
[2:32:54] that's why you need to receive also the
[2:32:56] life of your wife
[2:32:57] i think that's very clear yes
[2:33:03] in the name of saying that
[2:33:26] okay but that was you remember the word
[2:33:30] you receive it by
[2:33:32] right here
[2:33:47] because how can you have faith
[2:33:50] without the holy spirit convicting you
[2:33:54] it is the same holy spirit which was
[2:33:56] which was their justification
[2:33:58] which was their sanctification which
[2:34:00] will be there
[2:34:01] at maximum of the holy spirit baptism is
[2:34:03] exceeding
[2:34:05] god is accomplished with you you are now
[2:34:08] a full package now
[2:34:10] he's packaging packages ready for the
[2:34:12] rapture this one is ready
[2:34:14] you understand but there are many others
[2:34:16] still working on in the other procedures
[2:34:18] in their processes
[2:34:19] if others are slow and they are not
[2:34:21] working with them properly and
[2:34:22] they are still on the line of the holy
[2:34:24] ghost
[2:34:26] but they are not in the package
[2:34:31] therefore they don't go only because
[2:34:33] they're not ready but not because they
[2:34:35] were not
[2:34:35] good mate so you can get good material
[2:34:38] you can have the horribles
[2:34:40] not as in when we said that
[2:34:44] they had oil and they all listened to
[2:34:47] this
[2:34:47] ran out the revelation they had of the
[2:34:51] one
[2:34:51] was not enough the
[2:34:55] the life that they had within them was
[2:34:59] uh was that it was not the life of
[2:35:01] christ but
[2:35:02] somehow somewhere they never
[2:35:05] because they remember these people they
[2:35:07] had to go out and do what
[2:35:09] by what
[2:35:12] the oil how do you receive the oil today
[2:35:17] and that's the question now that it will
[2:35:18] come to can you receive the oil
[2:35:20] today without buying it
[2:35:34] every generation has sellers
[2:35:37] who are given the right by the right
[2:35:40] government
[2:35:41] to sell you shame you can get a uh
[2:35:44] order and begin saying here petrol
[2:35:47] it will imprison you immediately because
[2:35:49] you don't have the license
[2:35:51] so there are people giving renaissance
[2:35:54] to buy
[2:35:55] and sell that way they are bought from
[2:35:57] god
[2:35:58] and with the only one we know in every
[2:36:01] generation is that messenger in the hand
[2:36:03] of god
[2:36:04] jesus christ he sends him and
[2:36:07] john runs to this angel
[2:36:11] and he picks the book that book i can
[2:36:14] also say
[2:36:14] it's the same holy spirit it's this old
[2:36:17] time holy spirit
[2:36:18] and the devil what god near it that's
[2:36:20] the reason people fear me
[2:36:22] but it's good enough for me give me that
[2:36:27] give me that wait
[2:36:30] is that all time
[2:36:33] give me that
[2:36:48] and all of those who were in the
[2:36:50] generations before
[2:36:51] us they must update their faith like
[2:36:54] those of
[2:36:55] of after 19. when they receive that
[2:36:58] message
[2:36:58] how can you tell me that you have
[2:36:59] received the word i mean you have
[2:37:01] received the holy ghost
[2:37:02] when you reject the word
[2:37:07] if it is not possible right you have to
[2:37:09] receive the work
[2:37:11] for you to say you have the holocaust
[2:37:13] and also you have
[2:37:15] to receive what it was for you to say
[2:37:18] you you have the word otherwise what you
[2:37:20] have is just so important but not the
[2:37:22] word because the word must be the light
[2:37:24] so it is all in that range so i think
[2:37:27] i've answered your question brother
[2:37:30] i've
[2:37:43] enough for them their spirit was
[2:37:47] quenched
[2:37:48] and the bible says question of the holy
[2:37:50] spirit
[2:37:51] how do you question we keep on receiving
[2:37:55] when you are saved you are still forever
[2:37:58] you are similar to the day of your
[2:37:59] redemption
[2:38:00] but yes you keep on getting refilled
[2:38:02] every time
[2:38:05] but you are saved until the day
[2:38:08] of your redemption
[2:38:12] king's soul
[2:38:25] king saul at that time we are talking
[2:38:28] about the old testament before even the
[2:38:29] blood of jesus christ was shed
[2:38:32] but he was unearthed and king's soul
[2:38:34] never went to hell
[2:38:36] yes he went to hell to remember when
[2:38:39] psalm came
[2:38:40] prophet samuel what did he tell you
[2:38:45] what did he tell him you will be with me
[2:38:48] today
[2:38:50] so they were in the same place and that
[2:38:54] place was called
[2:38:57] was called raise up your his brother
[2:39:00] paradise that place was called paradise
[2:39:04] so they were in paradise together even
[2:39:06] saul went to paradise
[2:39:08] so we went to paradise he was with the
[2:39:11] prophet samuel
[2:39:12] so when jesus christ went you also
[2:39:14] picked him
[2:39:16] so i'm sure i would sit by the soul when
[2:39:18] i get up here
[2:39:20] hallelujah so because remember that was
[2:39:23] before
[2:39:24] the bleeding blood of christ was shed on
[2:39:27] the cross
[2:39:28] so i'm sure he was part of the receive
[2:39:32] all right another thing is hard for you
[2:39:34] to understand
[2:39:36] hallelujah
[2:39:51] came running to david with a with a
[2:39:53] crown claiming that saul was dead why
[2:39:55] did david
[2:39:56] did he killed him why did he kill him
[2:39:59] because he loved him really because of
[2:40:02] the love
[2:40:04] what lovely do you have for him i think
[2:40:08] it was because that soul was god's
[2:40:10] anointing
[2:40:11] what are you talking about so it was
[2:40:14] awaited by god
[2:40:16] today's anointing is the holy spirit he
[2:40:18] was seeing it
[2:40:21] so he can ask how dare you rejoice on
[2:40:24] the death of godzilla
[2:40:26] why he killed this boy he killed you
[2:40:31] so so so yes i know
[2:40:34] whenever we preach about you we preach
[2:40:36] to him or the negative
[2:40:38] but that does not mean that god is
[2:40:40] pattern can be broken
[2:40:42] if the man was sealed and anointed you
[2:40:45] will see
[2:40:47] i am still safe
[2:40:51] i am sealed by the spirit divine
[2:40:56] oh glory to god hallelujah
[2:41:00] amen i am jesus and i know
[2:41:03] he's mine where are they
[2:41:07] they are underneath the blood on the
[2:41:09] cross of calvary
[2:41:11] as far removed as darkness is from dawn
[2:41:15] in the sea of god's forgetfulness it's
[2:41:18] good enough for me
[2:41:20] praise god my sins are good
[2:41:23] praise god praise god
[2:41:30] the devil comes and tells you that you
[2:41:32] are a sinner blah blah blah but what
[2:41:34] happened with him he said well i don't
[2:41:35] know i don't even know where your sins
[2:41:37] are i've never seen them i'm not saying
[2:41:38] you're a sinner
[2:41:39] so don't tell me that there is not a
[2:41:41] type of astronomy
[2:41:42] i mean soul if you did those things that
[2:41:46] is how you are today
[2:41:47] many times you you know god does not
[2:41:50] know the sins of his loved ones because
[2:41:52] they don't see
[2:41:53] a child of god cannot see
[2:41:56] so what do mistakes do and i'm not
[2:41:58] telling you please you have our license
[2:41:59] to go and busy
[2:42:02] the bible says it is impossible for some
[2:42:05] for those who were once enlightened have
[2:42:07] been run from the
[2:42:09] you know the sims of the world and the
[2:42:11] things i've been seeing the light of
[2:42:12] christ
[2:42:13] to fall away from it it is impossible to
[2:42:14] renew them back again
[2:42:16] so don't go and say ah let me go like
[2:42:18] soul i will also be our
[2:42:20] pleas you must know who you are and
[2:42:23] you must reflect the life of who you are
[2:42:25] praise the lord
[2:42:27] allow me to conclude because if i don't
[2:42:29] conclude your questions are endless
[2:42:33] so uh we are going to finish patmos
[2:42:37] vision today
[2:42:38] whether we like it or not and i'm not
[2:42:40] continuing to discuss
[2:42:42] the details because we have already
[2:42:46] and i'm sure that whatever you have not
[2:42:48] understood you have given me the
[2:42:49] questions
[2:42:50] and most of it i've answered here others
[2:42:52] are answer it
[2:42:54] when you bring it but i think we have
[2:42:55] had a good discussion on this spirit yes
[2:42:57] and that has been a good highlight for
[2:42:59] the apartment's vision
[2:43:01] now in the fashion special many by the
[2:43:03] panama clicks on
[2:43:04] john being on the isle of patmos he also
[2:43:07] speaks on the lord he said because this
[2:43:09] is a very important part also it brings
[2:43:10] in a doctrine
[2:43:11] of the sabbath we didn't deal with with
[2:43:13] this about last time
[2:43:15] so we realized that what is our sabbath
[2:43:18] uh means rest so what is our rest
[2:43:22] somebody's rest
[2:43:24] so you must receive the holy ghost in
[2:43:26] order for you to go to the rapture if
[2:43:27] you don't receive the holy ghost you
[2:43:28] will not go to the rapture
[2:43:30] i'm sorry if it's bad news but you have
[2:43:33] to
[2:43:34] if you have not received the holy spirit
[2:43:35] you just go get closer with god and ask
[2:43:38] him to feed you the holy ghost
[2:43:40] read the word read the bible and love
[2:43:42] jesus he will give you the holiness
[2:43:43] there is no reason why he shouldn't give
[2:43:45] you the holy ghost and also be baptized
[2:43:47] in the name of
[2:43:48] jesus christ whatever you feel that is a
[2:43:50] hindering view
[2:43:51] to receiving the one good do it and take
[2:43:53] it out of the way because the prophet
[2:43:54] advises us not to let anything be in the
[2:43:56] way between us and him
[2:43:58] and the lord so whatever it is that is
[2:44:00] getting in the way of you receive the
[2:44:03] out of the way and allow him to feel you
[2:44:06] praise the lord
[2:44:08] all right so we know that our son at
[2:44:09] rest is is there is
[2:44:11] the holy spirit okay so i think that is
[2:44:14] just about it for the
[2:44:15] atmosphere of course he explains verse
[2:44:17] by verse from verse 1
[2:44:19] verse 10 and that part i think you have
[2:44:22] read it by yourselves
[2:44:24] uh we also talked about the golden lamb
[2:44:26] stance i think there's a sister
[2:44:28] who talked about it and she enabled us
[2:44:30] to discuss little bit i think it was on
[2:44:32] wednesday
[2:44:33] yeah so we did talk about that as well i
[2:44:35] want to go in it
[2:44:37] i i started reading that was it you
[2:44:40] was it you that was researching about it
[2:44:43] the golden lampstand
[2:44:46] was it you reading something on the
[2:44:48] computer in your office you're trying to
[2:44:49] extract the
[2:44:50] first number oh that was good but run it
[2:44:53] with me before you post it
[2:44:55] yeah that was but i saw the information
[2:44:57] it was nice but you can still run it
[2:44:58] with me i can just approach through
[2:45:00] okay uh that was nice um
[2:45:04] uh and by the way whenever the brother
[2:45:07] occurred across something
[2:45:08] how many or how many have their what's
[2:45:11] up acting right up here
[2:45:21] is active please
[2:45:24] we have about 10 people there whatsapp
[2:45:25] is active when the brother process on
[2:45:28] whatsapp
[2:45:29] um sends information about the meetings
[2:45:32] and about this
[2:45:33] uh you know now is even you see is it
[2:45:36] it's not sleeping it's trying to find
[2:45:38] something for you you know you post you
[2:45:39] just keep quiet as
[2:45:40] a as if you have not we should not be
[2:45:43] like pigs friends
[2:45:45] people just listen for
[2:45:47] [Music]
[2:45:49] they meet when they are there they
[2:45:50] cannot talk even so when you receive it
[2:45:52] sure that you have to see it
[2:45:54] put it up
[2:46:02] if you don't have nothing to post which
[2:46:03] means you are sharing it on other only
[2:46:05] platforms
[2:46:07] you should make a use of this i'm still
[2:46:09] waiting to see those people who are
[2:46:10] going to be the leader
[2:46:11] when i say very active there is getting
[2:46:14] delivered though
[2:46:15] this is getting because whatever you are
[2:46:17] trying to hear you are sharing with
[2:46:18] others
[2:46:19] but if you are out there very quietly
[2:46:35] okay we talked about the seven-fold
[2:46:37] glory of this person did anyone
[2:46:38] understand that part
[2:46:43] the seventh is the glory the second the
[2:46:46] second fourth glory of the person
[2:46:47] the seventh glory for the glory of jesus
[2:46:50] christ
[2:46:50] how how he's manifested as uh
[2:46:54] from his ear whereas everything had a
[2:46:56] meaning at a a place
[2:46:58] you know and uh his eyes as fire his
[2:47:00] feet as brass
[2:47:02] his uh is the right hand
[2:47:06] uh where seven uh
[2:47:10] he had seven stars in his right hand and
[2:47:11] the two edited sword
[2:47:13] you know everything had a meaning and
[2:47:15] you you were able to go through that
[2:47:17] while you were reading
[2:47:18] his face like the sun so i think we have
[2:47:21] concluded
[2:47:23] uh the patmos vision
[2:47:28] is there anything that we have not
[2:47:29] talked about and that you have not asked
[2:47:31] here
[2:47:32] that you thought should be dealt with
[2:47:36] anyone before we bring this to across
[2:47:41] since the agnes if you do not have the
[2:47:43] church edge book
[2:47:44] people here are very busy reading the
[2:47:46] church edit book
[2:47:48] and they have finished now the practice
[2:47:49] video which is the second chapter
[2:47:52] yes brother charlo i can see you are
[2:47:55] late
[2:47:56] i have just given you testimony a few
[2:47:59] minutes ago and
[2:48:01] i think you'll go back and see it i
[2:48:02] don't know if i i would like the
[2:48:05] details very well but uh i think you'll
[2:48:07] be blessed by that now
[2:48:09] i think
[2:48:12] [Music]
[2:48:13] all is covered
[2:48:19] you there's something which was not
[2:48:20] covered in the revelation of jesus
[2:48:21] christ for you
[2:48:22] but was that question asked here in the
[2:48:24] questions that i have
[2:48:26] and rather pray uh pray for pastor
[2:48:34] from dublin in ireland i've already told
[2:48:38] him
[2:48:39] that we are having these meetings and
[2:48:41] i've asked him
[2:48:42] to prepare to be with us in one of the
[2:48:44] meetings
[2:48:45] we've not yet agreed on which date but i
[2:48:48] believe if not this week
[2:48:49] probably next week we shall have him
[2:48:53] either on a tuesday on a friday so we
[2:48:55] shall have him and uh
[2:48:56] i'll let you know by by wednesday i
[2:48:59] think tomorrow
[2:49:00] i'll let you know i think i shall i
[2:49:02] should have already found out where you
[2:49:03] can have you
[2:49:04] so just pray over it and uh send me the
[2:49:08] questions you really would like him to
[2:49:09] deal with i have some here and if you
[2:49:11] have more that you'd like him to deal
[2:49:12] with
[2:49:13] but you make sure your question is
[2:49:15] detailed sister personally i love the
[2:49:17] way you ask your questions
[2:49:19] make sure your question is detailed not
[2:49:21] only one line
[2:49:22] make it detailed so that it can make
[2:49:24] sense to the person with answers
[2:49:26] okay so uh what's your question
[2:49:36] here is saying that absolutely
[2:49:53] okay wait 40 okay
[2:49:56] what does it say
[2:50:03] the last two lines okay you can read it
[2:50:06] but also speaker
[2:50:08] then we need to return leaving his bride
[2:50:11] in his father's house while he makes
[2:50:15] himself known
[2:50:16] to his brothers at this very
[2:50:20] very time the ant christ
[2:50:25] that the jews have led with trump
[2:50:28] but may wanted this first day this last
[2:50:31] day tonight
[2:50:32] but he will leave his bride in the
[2:50:35] father's house
[2:50:36] does it mean that jesus christ will come
[2:50:39] by himself
[2:50:41] i thought at first i thought maybe he
[2:50:43] would send
[2:50:47] that prophet
[2:51:02] like
[2:51:08] and as we live the type of joseph there
[2:51:10] is one more thing i want to bring to
[2:51:12] your attention about this end time
[2:51:14] you record as joseph stood there before
[2:51:17] his breath
[2:51:18] and when benjamin was not with them he
[2:51:20] spoke to one in that return
[2:51:22] is that the part oh
[2:51:25] i'm sorry i'm reading 41.
[2:51:30] for three and one half years while the
[2:51:32] retributive wrath of god is powered out
[2:51:36] she will be in the great marriage supper
[2:51:38] of the lamb
[2:51:39] then will he return leaving his bride
[2:51:43] in his father's house where he makes
[2:51:46] himself known
[2:51:47] to his brethren and
[2:51:50] when i really try to show you that jesus
[2:51:53] will come by himself
[2:51:56] yes but i thought he will
[2:52:06] is going to make himself known to his
[2:52:09] brethren
[2:52:10] how through the ministry
[2:52:15] of moses and elijah
[2:52:18] because right now he is making himself
[2:52:21] known to us
[2:52:22] but is he a physical
[2:52:27] he is not here physically he is
[2:52:30] with us through this world of the hour
[2:52:34] and so uh but also at the end of the
[2:52:38] three years and the heart because
[2:52:39] remember when jesus christ leaves
[2:52:41] and calms down on this earth he is going
[2:52:44] to
[2:52:45] take this world into a whole new
[2:52:48] time and this is going to be the
[2:52:49] millennium
[2:52:52] uh can you go to
[2:53:01] one two three now these 144 000
[2:53:04] are not in the bright in revelation 14 4
[2:53:07] they are called vaginas and they follow
[2:53:08] the lamb woods wherever he goes
[2:53:11] the fact that they have not defiled
[2:53:12] themselves with women show that they are
[2:53:14] units of matthew 19 22 the 12th
[2:53:19] the eunuchs were the keepers of the
[2:53:22] bridal chambers they were attendants
[2:53:24] notice that they do not sit in the
[2:53:27] throne
[2:53:27] but are before the throne and these are
[2:53:30] the ones by the way he is coming for
[2:53:33] okay now no they are not in the bride
[2:53:37] but will be in the glorious millennial
[2:53:39] ring now
[2:53:40] what i'm talking about because your
[2:53:42] question that you are you've just asked
[2:53:43] is in connection to the 144 thousand
[2:53:46] views right
[2:53:47] there are many things that are not
[2:53:49] answered to us
[2:53:51] about the 144 percent jews
[2:53:54] and you'll find every preacher trying to
[2:53:56] preach it the way it is revealed to them
[2:53:59] because that is the jews but everything
[2:54:02] that we as genders need to know
[2:54:04] from how we live here to where we go in
[2:54:07] the
[2:54:08] in the in the marriage to when we come
[2:54:10] back we know
[2:54:11] okay yes but we need to come to this one
[2:54:13] another reporting
[2:54:14] somehow some questions are unanswered
[2:54:18] why because he deals with the jews as a
[2:54:20] nation and
[2:54:22] that does not have anything to do with
[2:54:24] us
[2:54:25] nonetheless because we will talk about a
[2:54:28] question for example like a
[2:54:30] the 144 thousand where exactly
[2:54:34] do they live to go into the millennium
[2:54:38] because remember while the bride is in
[2:54:40] the millennium
[2:54:41] where are they they're here on earth
[2:54:46] receiving oh i'm sorry i'm sorry i
[2:54:48] shouldn't have said why the bride is in
[2:54:50] the name
[2:54:50] but while the bride is in the modern
[2:54:52] supper of the lamb
[2:54:54] because the millennium is the space of
[2:54:57] a thousand years on the earth
[2:55:00] what are the secrets of events because
[2:55:02] some of you are looking at me as if you
[2:55:03] are confused
[2:55:05] right now we are at the ending of the
[2:55:08] gentile dispensation
[2:55:10] i've recorded videos on the gender
[2:55:11] dispensation
[2:55:13] and i'm going to play the first one
[2:55:15] tomorrow until you enter on wednesday
[2:55:18] in our service so please don't miss it
[2:55:20] okay now
[2:55:22] my my my issue is that right now we are
[2:55:25] at the ending of the gentile
[2:55:28] dispensation and this will once it ends
[2:55:31] and
[2:55:32] how does it end it ends when the
[2:55:35] millennium
[2:55:36] oh i love the millennium that's what i'm
[2:55:38] talking about all the time it
[2:55:39] ends when the marriage suffer of the
[2:55:41] lamb or when the rapture
[2:55:46] then the general dispensation ends
[2:55:49] so we are at the time sister fortunate
[2:55:53] when the gentile dispensation is about
[2:55:58] to end are you following me yes when it
[2:56:01] ends it ashes in
[2:56:05] the rapture the rapture suddenly will
[2:56:08] actually
[2:56:10] the tribulation the contribution of this
[2:56:11] act first of
[2:56:13] three years and a half remember the
[2:56:16] three years and a half
[2:56:17] is the time which was which was
[2:56:19] previously
[2:56:20] remaining on the 70 weeks of daniel
[2:56:24] because there was one week which was
[2:56:26] remaining but this one week
[2:56:30] when by the time jesus was cut off he
[2:56:32] had already
[2:56:33] ministered three years and a half on
[2:56:34] half so the ministry of jesus on earth
[2:56:37] for three years especially three years
[2:56:38] and a half was a period
[2:56:41] of what we call the three years
[2:56:44] and a half was the half
[2:56:48] of the last week of the
[2:56:51] seventh weeks of daniel are you
[2:56:53] following me
[2:56:54] are you understanding what i'm saying
[2:56:58] when we say 70 weeks of daniel
[2:57:01] we made 70 weeks of years
[2:57:05] and uh when he was preaching on this i
[2:57:07] told people to say
[2:57:09] one week is equal to seven years so can
[2:57:12] you all say
[2:57:13] it one way is equal to
[2:57:16] so now when you say 70 weeks it means
[2:57:18] seven weeks old
[2:57:20] yeah multiply that by seven then you get
[2:57:22] the total number of years
[2:57:25] these were supposed to be how did he get
[2:57:27] it you can read
[2:57:28] daniel chapter nine danielle got this in
[2:57:31] a vision as he was praying and
[2:57:32] crying and praying for the people of
[2:57:34] jerusalem
[2:57:46] see that that is remaining
[2:57:49] the time that is remaining
[2:57:52] for the with the people of israel until
[2:57:55] the millennium
[2:57:56] and from the rebuilding of the 10th of
[2:57:58] jerusalem
[2:58:01] up to the millennium and that time
[2:58:03] started when the temple of
[2:58:05] solomon was debuted from the going forth
[2:58:08] of the beauty of that temple
[2:58:09] you remember the river was the one
[2:58:11] italian during the other king
[2:58:13] and they reviewed that temple
[2:58:17] and from that time the years
[2:58:20] started counting counting counting by
[2:58:23] the time jesus christ came
[2:58:26] they had remained seven years i know
[2:58:29] there are people who say
[2:58:30] no no no the last week is supposed to
[2:58:32] start after the rapture no
[2:58:33] the last week already started when jesus
[2:58:36] first came on earth
[2:58:39] and that last week remember is how long
[2:58:42] seven years and when jesus started his
[2:58:44] ministry that last week also
[2:58:47] started and when he did
[2:58:50] when the messiah was according to daniel
[2:58:53] says cut off
[2:58:54] where the messiah was cut off
[2:58:58] and when was he cut off after how long
[2:59:00] his ministry
[2:59:02] three years and a half now that period
[2:59:04] of three years and a half took the last
[2:59:06] half i mean the first half of the last
[2:59:09] seven
[2:59:10] years of god dealing with
[2:59:14] the jews and the gentiles
[2:59:18] we are now brought in from nowhere and
[2:59:21] we are put inside here between the space
[2:59:23] of the
[2:59:24] first half and the last half so for us
[2:59:27] we are placed
[2:59:28] in between here by grace
[2:59:31] we don't deserve it but by race we don't
[2:59:33] even know how many are going to be saved
[2:59:34] among us but they just know our men
[2:59:37] we don't even know how long we have but
[2:59:39] the jews know
[2:59:40] how long they are the only thing is that
[2:59:42] that time now is paused
[2:59:44] but soon it will be replayed when
[2:59:47] after the rapture then their time will
[2:59:49] be resumed and
[2:59:50] it will continue to count and it will be
[2:59:53] remaining three years and a half
[2:59:55] and that's three years and a half that
[2:59:57] this space will be
[2:59:58] when god calls the bride she goes in the
[3:00:00] rapture then this
[3:00:02] this uh after the rapture the three
[3:00:04] other allah starts to play
[3:00:06] that one will be when now the messiah
[3:00:09] will go back to the jews
[3:00:10] and he will make himself known to the
[3:00:11] jews through the two witnesses
[3:00:15] now the bible says he also comes down
[3:00:17] and he meets
[3:00:18] them he meets them remember the bible he
[3:00:21] says when he was coming down
[3:00:23] he came with tens of thousands of these
[3:00:25] saiyans
[3:00:26] but they were behind him as he rolled
[3:00:28] ahead of them those ones who were behind
[3:00:30] him are his bride
[3:00:33] we were coming with him but actually he
[3:00:34] came before us
[3:00:36] so it could be that he introduced
[3:00:38] himself to them
[3:00:39] that during that time of his coming but
[3:00:43] that was at the end of the three year
[3:00:46] and a half
[3:00:46] which also is the is the time of the
[3:00:50] end or the the end of the war of
[3:00:53] armageddon which is the third world war
[3:00:56] after that special time when he comes
[3:00:59] down
[3:01:00] he is because when he comes down
[3:01:03] they will want to kill him you imagine
[3:01:06] these people the powers that will be at
[3:01:08] the
[3:01:08] at that time they will think they can
[3:01:09] destroy the messiah
[3:01:11] they will see they can destroy christ
[3:01:12] the king of kings
[3:01:14] that's when they will realize that they
[3:01:15] cannot kill the god of the jews because
[3:01:17] that will be the god of the jews he will
[3:01:19] be defending the jews fighting for the
[3:01:21] jews
[3:01:22] and by the time that he has they can't
[3:01:23] kill he will consume all of them
[3:01:26] and this this world as we know it this
[3:01:28] earth as we know it
[3:01:29] will all be different this act as we
[3:01:32] know it we know it
[3:01:34] the civilization of that world will all
[3:01:35] be different
[3:01:37] because everything will be will come to
[3:01:39] an end
[3:01:41] people will die and they will remain
[3:01:44] dead
[3:01:45] until the end of the millennium
[3:01:49] one person asked me a question so if
[3:01:51] these people will die and they will
[3:01:52] remain lead until the end of the
[3:01:53] millennium
[3:01:55] what are we going to rule over because
[3:01:56] the bible says we are going to rule over
[3:02:00] did you know that we haven't ruled over
[3:02:01] people in the millennium
[3:02:03] you did not know you thought you were
[3:02:05] going to be in a lonely planet
[3:02:07] how can he accept us to be in our own
[3:02:09] planet where the devil's children are
[3:02:11] ruling over us in a plan where we have
[3:02:14] very many of us it must be a repeat of
[3:02:17] events
[3:02:18] that will be the king these are the
[3:02:19] kingdoms of them of man yeah but that
[3:02:22] will be the kingdom of our god remember
[3:02:24] that would be the stone which came and
[3:02:25] hit the other image and the image went
[3:02:28] into pieces
[3:02:29] it will be the kingdom of our god the
[3:02:30] bible says the kingdoms of the world
[3:02:33] have become the kingdom of our god
[3:02:36] of jesus christ hallelujah so now
[3:02:39] that would be the millennium there will
[3:02:42] be people on this earth
[3:02:44] of course there will be a few remnants
[3:02:45] who will escape
[3:02:47] the judgments of god during that time
[3:02:50] and they will report
[3:02:51] of course the people here who are very
[3:02:52] intelligent they even build bankers
[3:02:54] where
[3:02:55] you cannot cannot kill them they will
[3:02:57] come out and they realize that well they
[3:02:59] even have active movies out of it
[3:03:01] the world is different everything is new
[3:03:04] that will be the time
[3:03:05] when they realize now there is another
[3:03:06] kingdom on earth
[3:03:08] and they will realize that karemwa
[3:03:39] don't don't miss the millennia
[3:03:42] because if you miss the millennium will
[3:03:43] you remain in the grave and trust you
[3:03:44] shall enjoy here
[3:03:45] anyhow hallelujah
[3:03:48] and another time when we come out and we
[3:03:51] start ruling over them and
[3:03:53] i'm telling you i can continue on and on
[3:03:55] but what i can say
[3:03:56] is that will be a momentous marvelous
[3:03:59] time
[3:03:59] and at that time then the bible says
[3:04:02] then
[3:04:03] that of course there will be the war of
[3:04:06] of
[3:04:06] uh gold and marble broken mother would
[3:04:09] be
[3:04:09] the nation that will will be the
[3:04:11] superpowers on at that time
[3:04:14] that they will be uh
[3:04:17] they will be deceived by the devil
[3:04:19] because remember
[3:04:21] for a space of a half for the space of a
[3:04:23] thousand years
[3:04:24] that where was the devil bound
[3:04:28] where in the potential speech for
[3:04:31] espresso
[3:04:32] a thousand years a millennium bite
[3:04:52] you know what let us go and consume this
[3:04:54] city we shall have a city on this earth
[3:04:56] a real city it will meet the eternal
[3:04:59] city of god
[3:05:00] which job of europe to fall did
[3:05:12] to attack this city the devil will
[3:05:15] deceive them because
[3:05:16] he will not know that this is an eternal
[3:05:18] city fire will come from heaven if you
[3:05:20] consume all these people
[3:05:22] and then the bible says tables will
[3:05:24] change then there will be
[3:05:28] a terrible set there will be
[3:05:32] him the king of kings the lord of lords
[3:05:34] together with
[3:05:35] us to judge the living
[3:05:39] and the dead which means the dead shall
[3:05:42] rise
[3:05:43] there will be now the mass resurrection
[3:05:46] which i've called the third
[3:05:47] resurrection the masses that everyone
[3:05:51] that has ever lived will resurrect
[3:05:53] even those who die in the previous
[3:05:55] condition
[3:05:56] they resurrect they will all stand
[3:05:58] before the
[3:06:00] the the jab their bride is not going to
[3:06:03] be in
[3:06:03] this judgement their bride will not be
[3:06:07] joined
[3:06:07] this is the word from judgments you have
[3:06:10] people say every one of us will say we
[3:06:11] stand before you no
[3:06:12] the brain will not stand before him the
[3:06:15] brain will be with him because our
[3:06:17] judgment is here today
[3:06:18] today here today so at that time we
[3:06:21] shall be the one judging together with
[3:06:24] christ and then these people while they
[3:06:27] are there
[3:06:28] trying to to to you know to come and
[3:06:30] talk about themselves you know the
[3:06:31] fruits virginia will also come
[3:06:33] the other jews who are not a part of the
[3:06:35] 14400 will come and the
[3:06:37] other you know all the other groups of
[3:06:38] the world will come they will be judged
[3:06:40] how be completely upon christ
[3:06:44] and his bride and then after the one
[3:06:47] thing
[3:06:48] you know of course before their judgment
[3:06:50] they they all said that this happened
[3:06:52] the first prophet and they therefore
[3:06:53] were cast in the lake of fire and all
[3:06:55] these people
[3:06:56] who will be judged to be condemned will
[3:06:58] be also cast in the same place
[3:07:00] and after that you know balabanon says
[3:07:03] this hell is not a tunnel
[3:07:04] god will do away with it
[3:07:08] maybe it will burn for a billion of
[3:07:09] years but then it will do
[3:07:11] i mean i will then be all
[3:07:14] we have a new heaven and a new
[3:07:18] ah things will start again from genesis
[3:07:22] from genesis 1 1.
[3:07:26] that's where we are headed that's why
[3:07:28] everybody dies everybody's born dance
[3:07:30] and
[3:07:30] we are only waiting for that time we
[3:07:32] open up that don't think that this is
[3:07:34] how things are going to continue
[3:07:36] things will not continue as youtube so
[3:07:37] no wonder you people who are
[3:07:39] deciding to sound christ serve him with
[3:07:41] all your heart because we only have one
[3:07:43] chance on life to make things right
[3:07:45] this is the only time we have others
[3:07:47] have died and have left this one they
[3:07:49] can't correct anything but
[3:07:50] you you have time to correct whatever
[3:07:53] you have made wrong
[3:07:54] this is the only challenge you have yes
[3:07:55] correct it once you die
[3:07:57] it is finished done we sing for your
[3:08:00] last song
[3:08:01] you go to your place and you wait for
[3:08:03] that wait from the end
[3:08:05] but if you know you are died you are
[3:08:06] dead in christ don't wait for the wife
[3:08:08] from then
[3:08:09] wait for the rapture hallelujah because
[3:08:12] you will surely rise
[3:08:14] again i will show you guys again
[3:08:17] give me that song we shall rise
