very little time thank you so much for coming to church today reward you abundantly and receive your desire this night in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ are you open John 5 verse one up to 8 we read in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ John chapter 5 verse 1 to8 this there was a feast of the Jews just follow me just and Jesus went up to Jerusalem now there is at Jerusalem by the ship Market a pool which is called in the Hebrew tongue having five PES in this a great multitude of importent FK of blind the heart the with waiting for the moving of the water for any Angel went down at a certain season in the pool and and and he says and troubled the watero then first after the troubling of the water stepped in was made war of whatever disease he had and a certain man was there which had an infirmity 38 years when Jesus saw him lied down there and he knew that he had been now a long time in that case he said unto him be made it was a question the import man answered him sir he didn't know this is the Lord thought this just the same the normal man Sir with all respect I have no man when the water is troubl I have no man to put me into the pool but while I am coming another steps down Jesus said unto him rise take up thy B and walk amen may God have the bless the reading of his words you may take your seats you may take your seats pray prayers have been made we are not going to pray again we are consecrated already to the service of the Lord this thought I've got it here here I came with a different thought God changed it and he gave me another thought for a time as this brothers and sisters I've learned from our pastor to surrender to the leadership of the holy spirit amen this night I want to talk uh my subject is I have no man I have no man I have no man there was the Bible says that there was this pool it had five pches in and all the sick having problems would come and gather there and the angel of God come down at a certain season and Trouble the water trouble the water but now it was by chance it was chance whoever enters in F is the one that gets the healing the rest of them have to wait for another season when the water when the angel will come again and start up the wat now this man the Ang come and he start up the waters and he didn't get his he why because he had no money to help him up take him in the PCH get he then Jesus came Hallelujah hallu then Jesus came there was no man the import he was heless The Lord Of Glory came the man say Sir Jesus asked the question w't you be made you have been he knew that he had been in this problem for a long time and he says no no no this time you don't have to wait for an angel to come from heaven and appear and start up the water the Lord Has Come rise up take up your bed and walk brothers and sisters perhaps your problem has been for a long time from January of 2024 you had prayer request it has lingered it has lingered until today the 31st of December but Jesus when he

that can do it is your faith in your faith in the preaching before we continue God is getting ready to f someone here today with the Holy Spirit I do not know who it is but maybe you you are tired of how you are living the kind of life you have been living and you were wey and burdened and you've tried many and those things are failed like the preacher said you have tried many things and you've made up decisions and it didn't work out but he said he can be your point of what you have had today can be your point of contact to receive the Holy Spirit throughout everything he preached I felt the spirit of God moving his presence is here right [Music] now his presence is here right now now I do not want you to think about your surrounding I want you to think about the promise he said a man that is spiritual is a few inches from being a mad man are you ready to receive the Holy Spirit are you ready to sacrifice everything to sacrifice your pride sacrifice your self-righteousness are you ready to totally surrender yourself and say Lord I believe what the preacher has preached I receive that as my point as I begin this year I'm tired I'm tired of the way I've been I need a change I need a power in my soul that will help me to be different I need Holy Spirit if you filled others can you not do the same again we have talked and talked and talk about the Holy Spirit but now I am telling you listen to these words this can also be your point of contact if you believe it and say Lord now I'm ready to receive it doesn't need you to pray for a full month it takes your faith to believe in his ability to fill your soul with his Spirit if the Bible is true if there is a God in heaven if the God we worship is real he will honor your Fai he will come down and feel you he's more than able to feel you I want you to be in prayer the holy spirit is here disorganize our programs a little if only we can accept if only we can agree are you not tired of that burden are you not tired of the life that you have been living of trying and failing are you not tired you have to be tired fast you have to be willing fast and then say Lord what I've had today I'm receiving it as my point

of the Lord but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen vessel unto me to Bear my name before the Gentiles and Kings and the children of [Music] Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake amen let's have a word of prayer precious Ling father thank you precious Ling father for your presence Lord God which we have heard even before before the service has ended Lord we know your presence is reading of your word Lord I ask that you come Lord and break it down to your people speak to them personally Jesus and fulfill purpose which Lord you want to bless you Saints amen happy New Year amen amen today I want to speak about a very short topic it says for his name's sake for his name sake hallelujah hallelujah amen amen so you see in life many people do things for certain reason amen amen men get married mared amen for certain purposes amen amen a man marries because he wants to to bring forth his he want to extend his his his seed amen amen so a man would marry when a man marries when they get married to a woman that woman gets the name of that amen woman becomes part of that amen so there there are three three ways you can enter into a family of a man legally here in the earth amen one of it is getting married if you're a woman when you get married to that man you receive your his name amen amen for example brother his wife amen before she came she was not sister but when she got married to she obtain the name of there's another way of getting joining in a family of a man the second the second way is by adoption amen I can enter into brother if he adts me and he gives me his name I become because he has given me the other way is being born naturally amen when you are born naturally father automatically you have the amen so God all the time wanted to have people who are called by his he wanted to have a wife who is called by his he wanted to have children who are called by his and he wanted to adopt children and he gives them his name hallelujah hallelujah I mean I I want to give another background of recent the in USA they were having election amen and the president who was elected his theme was that to make America greater amen he say that the name of America is no longer feared we are being laughed at yet we we had power we were powerful amen so he said I'm going give me your voice I'm going to make America great hallelujah amen that is a man and he loved his country he loved the name of his country Hallelujah and even us in our walk our God wants his name to be great amen and for his name to be great can't be great when you who are called by his name you are not great when he for him to be great you have to be great because you are called by his Hallelujah and there are certain things which he does because you are called by his name examp the Bible tells us when the children of [Music] isra Amen when they were coming from Egypt amen God wanted to destroy amen but Moses reasoned with he told God these are your people they are called by amen and God changed he said now I'm not going to destroy but I'm going to leave them to die and their children will be the ones to enter in the promised land why because he never wanted his name to be laughed upon his name to be sa upon the Heathen these people were woring a certain God he told them he's going to get them from EGP to the promised land but he failed them amen so he said I'm not going to let my name be be left upon amen amen so as I told you human beings we are born in this human flesh amen we are not born as children of as I told there are three ways you can become a you can get that name of Amen being born you should be born with the spirit hallelujah or you have to get married you receive his name amen Pastor the other time was preaching to us about the king the king amen uh the the the the the queen who was who rejected the call of the of the king the king had married her amen she had the name of the king and she rejected to obey the call of the king so when these men came to the king told the king this has said she has her own part amen so these men told him can it be hard throughout all the proves that the queen that you married called her and she rejected amen amen the men the wives of the Men start disobeying them and the people will start disobeying you they will not respect your name amen so the king decided to get a queen because he wanted his name don't to be ashamed my brother my sister if you received the holy spirit amen God has given you his name you have his name in amen and whatever you are going through whatever you went through last year amen you had that that that the other name your natural name you are but now he has given you his Amen Let us let us open the uh Psalms 251 amen it says what for thy name's sake oh Lord pardon my iniquity for it is great David wrote thiss it was a time of Tri it was a time of test amen when his enemies had had risen upon Hallelujah so he made a prayer and say name s Lord my iniquity for it is great amen what did David Point God at he pointed God at his amen he said that pardon my in Amen in Psalms 23 three he says he Resto my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name sake amen God leads us the of for his name s David being a king upon many men and Nations God LED his Paths of right because the people would recognize his great name amen God purposed to make David walk in the paths of why because David was called by the name of Amen David when he was anointed he was anointed to be a king a physical King on behal of God Amen so he was a representative of God amen so he was standing there representing the name ofj God make sure he had to walk of Hallelujah Hallelujah for his name sake amen Amen brother Dan preached he read in acts when Paul met the pillar of fire amen and I read here as I read let me read again I want to show you something there amen acts 9:15 this is God now he speaking uh okay let me start from verse 12 16 he said and he has seen in a vision a man named ananas coming in and putting his hand on him that he may receive his sight then ananas answered Lord I have heard by many of this man how much evil he hath done to thy Saints at Jerusalem [Music] [Music] amen and here he had Authority from the chief chief priests to bind all that call on [Music] thy amen but the Lord said unto him go thy way for he is a chosen unto me to Bear My Name the Gentiles KS and the children for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name amen so Paul the Bible tells us that we were chosen before the foundation of the amen so so Paul before even he was born he was already chosen amen before you were born before you were born when you come to this earth you come already having a father amen amen before brother and sister amen amen they they came here amen they never had Israel amen were two isra was not in the amen so when he was born already already him being born already he had a father amen so before Paul even before he was born already amen he had already hallelujah hallelujah so he he just needed preached a point of to recognize his father amen it didn't matter whatever he did you know when when you when you believe the devil lik pointing you to your mistakes before you you believe and you become you become chained amen amen but but here the Bible is telling us that this man sa even you see as God was speaking to anas told him that this man has been amen he has been pers but what did God say God I chose him amen hallelujah it doesn't matter whatever he did I chose him amen bear my name upon the Gentiles hallelujah hallelujah and in this age my brother my sister we are called to Bear the name of to declare the as I told you that the the other way of being born adoption we are given the spirit of God which is the spirit of AD amen so when you are given the spirit of God you have Beed his name because you you have the name of your father amen amen that's how you bear the name of the Lord hallelujah amen so there are certain things which will happen when you bear the name of sometimes you be in this life and you'll be afflicted you will be uh having needs here and there amen amen and often times you get weak in your faith Hallelujah you get weak in your amen the Bible tells us amen that whatever we shall ask shall do it am sometimes you fear you have a faith of believing that your level you are working is 500,000 amen that is your level of Amen the Bible says that whatever shall ask the whatever whatever amen I shall give it unto you amen if you pray in my name amen and the prophet tells us amen that you ask for big things amen ask for big things hallelujah hallelujah imagine married amen uh rejecting uh uh to to use the cow brother amen oh sister refusing to drive the car brother amen yet he's married whatever he has she has amen whatever God has we have whatever belongs to him it belongs to us Amen brother Mar was preaching about our inheritance amen let me tell you my brother you have his name let me tell you something the B tell that the people if the people who are called by my name shall humble themselves hallelujah hallelujah shall hear from not everyone Heen not everyone that God hears last year many people were in churches they were calling upon him but were they called by his name those people were called by if they humble and pray I will hear and I will answer you have to be called by hallelujah amen amen amen the Temple when it was built in the amen the difference it from all other amen it pleased God to put his name in that Temple that is the different amen amen that is the same thing we need right now amen we need a message which has the name of the which has the power of Our Lord amen let me read there in in in second Corin 2 Chronicles amen amen 2 Chronicles 7 yeah second chronic now mine eyes shall be open and mine ears attend unto the prayer that is made in this place for now have I Chosen and Sanctified this house for that my name may be there forever and mine eyes and Mine Heart shall be their perpetu amen [Music] amen amen amen you've seen that amen that house God put there his name amen that is the difference amen and that's why he always had their prayer because his name but now we God is no longer in the temple of bricks amen God dwells in the Temple of Man amen and that man for him to be special amen God has to put his you cannot put his name on inside you by yourself as we've read he say that I'll put my name he will put he's the one to put the one to give you his the one to give you his name is the one to choose and now I'm going to marry you and you're going to have my name it is not the sister choose amen so we are chosen found Hallelujah and we are called by his name amen and he promised us hallelujah hallelujah Let Us open in the book of isaiah3 Isaiah 43 fear not for I am with thee I will bring bring th seed from the East and thee from the West amen amen he was speaking to the children of this was a promise amen it was even fulfilled in 1945 when he gaed again the children of Israel the promised land amen but let's find out why [Applause] and he said I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back amen bring my sons from far and my daughters the end of the even everyone that is called by my name I have created him glory I have formed him I have made him amen amen the children of isra why they can't be defeated Israel the Bible tells us that Israel is my first he has his name so they can't be destroyed amen we are we are we are we are we are brothers with with Israel amen if we receive his spirit amen become Israel and we cannot be defeated has told us that fear not for I am with thee if you receive his name is with you hallelujah hallelujah I will bring thy seed from amen now I want to take it to to your your address you know the children of is is Russia amen Russia there is C amen it's completely different a completely different atmosphere from the Middle East but God say he's going to bring them from there and bring them back to his land amen you may be in a situation which is as far amen from God you can never think may be sick with a very terrible sick amen which is so far amen from the goodness of God God has promised that fear not I will bring thee from the East and gather thee from the West am no matter your situation amen God has promised going to bring amen because of his name you have to receive his name you have to receive his name hallelujah hallelujah amen Amen Let Us open the book of Gans amen amen amans 52 amen do you love the Lord you love the word amen Gans 5S but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentle goodness Faith Temperance against such there is no amen amen these are the fruits you have to bear for his name amen when sister leaves his home and he goes into another man's home that man was married he has to change her ways amen he has to move in the way the man whom he has married amen and he has to Bear the character that that man amen so these are the fruits of the spirit speaking am God wants people who are full of love full of joy full of Peace long suffering gent uh goodness such there is no law hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen amen but these fruits you have to get married you have to be born amen when I came to the message amen I I found people no I found people amen who are full of love amen full of joy full oface and I desire to have amen but I didn't know how I couldn't force myself to get this amen like Pastor told us not your Works amen you have to be born Hallelujah you have to get married you receive his name those characters those fruits come hallelujah amen am so I want to speak about something here as I'm finish amen very fast amen uh in the book of First Samuel amen he says for the Lord will not forsake his people for his great name sake because it pleased the Lord to make you his people the background of the scripture if you read before there the people had rejected the king rejected so when they rejected said we want a king amen we want a king amen so God God spoke to to to you give them a king amen amen but before he told them that this King will mistreat you and and if you read before he challenged them he asked them he asked them what have I what wrong have I done have I ever taken something from you amen have I ever mistreated why then did you reject reject God Amen prayed a prayer and he said let let the let the presence of God come for Amen Let the presence of God be shown amen the Bible says that there was a loud thunder amen and the people trembled Hallelujah huj so when they trembled they repented they told someone forgive us amen for we had not seen that our God is with us sometimes you think that God is not with amen but such presences like this come show you with you that is with this message with us amen so when they repented the Lord the Lord said for the Lord will not forsake forsake his people for his name's [Music] sake amen because it pleased the Lord make you his people you are the people of God called by his hallelujah amen he cannot forsake this year is not going to for Hallelujah whatever you desire if you called by his have let meend with this very F amen amen he says that's the great person the Lord

I do it the best way I can so sometimes it makes people I live with it makes it hard for them to get rid of me so it was such a big a big big battle but we made a decision and ever since we made that decision we have never regretted we have seen troubles and tears but God has stood with us and we are on the winning side when I was growing I was a person who never waited to be told to do something I could do everything which I see needs to be done and when I joined my pastor he has been an immen blessing in my life let me speak this from the bottom of my heart take it the way it is one day Paul

shadow uh the Lord being the shadow of the good things to come could never make a worshiper perfect then it goes on amen amen okay let me start here it is a strange thing that this is so much thought

you'll have what you ask for amen confess positive claim things which are not claim things which looks impossible hallelujah praise the name of the Lord claim things which man cannot do because that's what God can do praise the name of the Lord may God bless you amen amen shall we say Amen uh that that Romans chapter 4 it says vers 14 for they which are no no just want to yes verse 17 as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and cth those things which be not not as though they were yes yes vers 17 can the musicians come please he cth those things which are not as they were praise the Lord that is the last them we are going to go with this year it is not call it as if it is well you've believed your healing but you're not yet healed but you believe you are healed so you should confess you are here you remember that testimony and I always um uh if you can tell deacons if you can bring in everybody who is outside we want to now finish our our service you know I I I've shared this with um sister Diana many times that the testimony of the man who was blind he came in a prayer line andam prayed over him but before he prayed for him he asked him do you believe me to be God's prophet he said yes you believe if I pray for you God will make you all he said yes he said okay let us pray so he prayed and after he said amen he opened his eyes he said I can't see he said go on your way believing God will heal you so the man went and after a while he realized he was not seeing he came back again in the prayer line and many of us do that mistake many times we come we pray over the same matter over and over and over and over but we need to believe and start confessing and then brother bam told this man uh when he came back in the prayer line you said the man said to him you told me that I was healed but I'm still blind he said but you told me you believed me said yes I believed you if believed me go your way you are healed not you will be healed you are healed you are seeing and yet the man was still blind but the prophet was telling him you are seeing you are and then when he left he was told to keep saying these words by his stripes I'm Healed by his stripes I'm heal tell your neighbor by his stripes I'm Healed by his stripes I'm Healed and the man kept on saying that he kept on confessing saying those things which were not as if they were out and then one day his eyes boom opened up praise the name of the Lord so also our sister Diana's eyes listen ch are you hearing God is able to open them you people don't believe that do you believe that God is able to open them amen amen and we are able to call those things which are not as if they they are praise the name of the Lord if the Lord can do for that for us that year that thing this year oh we can be is so happy praise the name of the Lord you want some miracles for this year God is able to do miracles for this year to do the impossible things and the one thing that touched me as the brother was preaching do you think there were not many roads that would have made them go to the promised land and were many but God left all of them and he took them in the impossible one the Red Sea because he specializes in things thought impossible praise the Lord hallelujah amen how many have enjoyed this program I
