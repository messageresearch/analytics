========================================

[Applause] [Music] amen as you lift your hands if you want that fire of god let us sing that one more time as a prayer sing it new to you and the lord with all your heart lifting up your hands as a sign of surrender to him [Music] my is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] that we might be able to receive the holy spirit could desire we ask that you come and speak to us in jesus name amen amen amen we take john 20 once again i'm happy to see you all that i've made it tonight my name is i'll probably be an hour however you have to jack matters our game i do that so that all your attention you can give it to me i want to know right so we're reading from verse 19. then then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shot where the disciples where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and and stood in the midst and said unto them peace peace unto you foreign he showed unto them his hands and his side then were the disciples glad when they saw the to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send iu oh yes and when he had said this he breathed on them and he said unto them receive ye the holy ghost praise the name of the lord you may have your seat tonight so this we are taking part two of receive the holy ghost uh as usual for before you buy or save the service i mean god bless you no come about encouraging you to always pray for the service before you come back even as if you don't have time even as you are walking on the road you can be praying so we find that here jesus he begins to speak to the disciples this was shortly after the resurrection and you know that jesus had died and everybody the pharisees thought that it is done just finished enough he noticed that nothing of what he had created was in his image the eleventh if you're never turned at the world which are in which fought on each other it all came out of god beyond never living it came out of the spoken word nothing of those things that he had created was an express image of the living god so he needed an image in which [Applause] amen so we notice that [Music] quickly go to the book of genesis you can see in the okay name challenge already everyday and the bible says i believe verses 26 verse chapter one is truly so all right maybe to get a clear picture we can begin from verse 24. [Music] and god said let the earth be bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so so and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after thee after his kind and god saw that was good [Music] but then he noticed that he had nothing after his kind of his own kind oh quick and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea buff and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that keeps upon the earth guru never so you notice church that we the human race or children anti-faith was created for what purpose against to have the million then they found [Applause] and you know that is why as a church of god a nature full of angry cancer controversy to assimilate fire let me tell you we want to god to jail control that something else needs to take away god is no longer the one ruling over the church the church has repressed it with the constitution of the church according but then he's not gonna say what can i do to help you get into your original condition that is your original image furniture which we lost at the beginning [Music] their standing amen whereby every all the children that are born i would never die that's not the image of god you're saying hey that is why people who are in our churches macan saga failed them to know jesus christ many parents who are believers automatically their children are believers it is not so they shouldn't wait too until many of them can't take up their scenes until they themselves man has has had an experience and an encounter with god and sings no difference from the other peace he has no difference he may have the seed that right now my desire is after this series i'm just laying the foundation of it and we will go a little deeper the lord will give us grace i want you to be able to understand their characteristics that without the holy spirit we don't even have a right to be called a child of course why right because they don't have the holy spirit that is the holy spirit the holy spirit is supposed to be your ruler oh my goodness the world god is the ruler catholic but the way we are born hallelujah he came to god yes jericho and suggested to god everything was okay tell me a better wish than that one he had sacrificed his brother on a stone yeah yet i said ginger and now he was presenting himself before no difference from a witch [Music] and all of us are born with that kind of spirit and nature upon us everyone who turned their way with you but it was not supposed to be our original nature foreign image [Applause] hallelujah take it drop praise the name of the lord amen and so jesus comes here after the resurrection yes praise the name of the lord and and uh just take it one hour after that i'll just quit and continue next time amen hallelujah amen after the resurrection of jesus yes to show how important how important his death was of his death on the cross the moment he comes to his bill to the disciples no longer he showed them how he was crucified [Music] that you may be born because remember adam was taken was taken out of the east side hallelujah and jesus was showing them hallelujah [Music] the first eve was born that way yes but she's sinned i needed to pay a price a sinless why didn't i trust royal tidiness and who was it it was the king of glory god himself he came and took on yeah and then he paid the ultimate price on the course of calvary and so he showed them when he came to the decision to show them his name again and amen which means that they touched him and then my goodness there's something that is so much in these few verses concerned that we literally read only that and finished because it works for me down i have a lot of gods here but we didn't even cut anything you know a little progress my is it is signifying today children of this house of clay in the new mexico this house of christ and then you may enter spot your flesh that's the prison coming up but jesus he braved the breath of life to the disciples hallelujah amen which means you don't need to die to receive the holy [Music] [Music] of god now i want us to take it in the old testament the holy spirit is more than just excitement and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of their land and to a good land and a large and to a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the evites and the jeb sites now there are behold the cry of the children of israel is common to me and i've also seen the oppressed oppression where with the egyptians oppress them [Music] [Music] now we see that here god comes down to speak and speak uh he speaks to moses and he tells him that these people the egyptians the the the the israelites i'm giving them a land need a balance i'm giving them a good land and sinnoh i'm going to bring them out in the background and i'll give them a land my wednesday it will be a large land and it will be a land flowing with milk and honey you realize that before the fall man was living in heaven god is intention for man and she can't do it almost to live in a good land in a large land his name is jews but you died yeah we know as israelites are you following me and these people he wanted to call them by his name that is yes we always type the land to be the holy ghost amen and we see that these people who are going to this land when everybody became a muslim they were called out by the church of [Music] [Music] god is not giving you the holy ghost because you are the best of the best because you are prayerful everybody else god has promised to give you the holy spirit because it is for you to receive let me amen [Music] and then they prayed for [Applause] so that without the holy ghost if there is no salvation you preach the gospel to become a little poor people in a corner that is so sorry do you think that this goes for god has given it to us so that he can make us feel bad in this world cannot show me and manifest the power of god on this earth then i don't think i will need it in heaven this gospel must be a living gospel [Music] [Applause] they have even taken the same things and promises of god for us but the very nearest [Music] as a promises [Applause] there is a reality hallelujah god manifests himself the [Music] [Music] [Music] and yet it was a heating day i think i'll i'll record that for you in the next service i'll read for you the next services let's continue on because we have a few minutes tonight i mean not here that the jews want to kill them until they have to come to a land flowing with milk and honey oh my hallelujah hallelujah my heart is fasting whereby we shall have god fasting himself in our families in our lives is they perished with the rest of the unbelievers what what was his message his message was not for them to be educated [Music] is why right because the devil did not have a problem with zero as long as that revel that revealed the mystery of you could it is in the future we shall go in the promised land the devil says amen now you are here but now yeah they never feared yet yes because these two bananas foreign through our prophet [Music] we are going to you need to be [Applause] are you one of those and the believers went out and i am continuing to quote here and the people who laughed and made fun and would not accept his message they perished with the rest of the unbelievers giving us a promise of mighty powers oh manifested in the right minister now why should we take it what the prophet said is already [Music] [Music] [Music] even now i did you know that the prophet preached and said what you expect is what you gave they went under the was killed in there and entered into the promised land they went under the anointed message of the messenger there is no way you can enter into the promised land without the messenger's message there is no way you can receive listen listen the true genuine holy ghost without the messenger's message you know some people when we talk about the holocaust they think it's just something separate from the message not when you believe that was the place [Music] [Music] what was the importance of the holy spirit they can't worry about ghana let me tell you when you get the holy spirit he hinders you from doing certain things your body might want to because if you don't have the hallelujah glory to god you see why we need the holy ghost cannot stand and preach the message you will preach that word [Applause] amen [Music] thank you jesus thank you for the power that you have sent to us oh lord jesus may you fear us will you give us the power to overcome [Music] peace what oh hallelujah [Music] thank you jesus thank you jesus thank you it's your name it's
