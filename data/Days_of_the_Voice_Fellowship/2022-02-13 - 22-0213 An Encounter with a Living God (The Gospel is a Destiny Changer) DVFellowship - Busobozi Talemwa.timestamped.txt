[37:04] [Music]
[37:06] uh i'd forgotten one sister praise
[37:09] has a testimony
[37:11] my eye was telling me that i saw
[37:14] this name but i was looking for the
[37:16] paper everywhere until i thought maybe
[37:19] it was a mistake so my sister
[37:22] just come and give your testimony that
[37:24] will bless you
[37:35] god bless you church
[37:38] i have three testimonies but i'm going
[37:40] to cut them short
[37:43] first testimony i want to thank god on
[37:46] sunday as we are here from the service
[37:50] we got an accident
[37:53] the the buddha border man who was taking
[37:56] us we were in jam
[37:58] along that road
[38:00] opposite the market where we exactly had
[38:02] the
[38:03] outreach
[38:04] when we reached there
[38:06] the man i think the man of the car
[38:09] got an instant break
[38:12] then the one who was driving us
[38:14] continued and drove and knocked the car
[38:17] but i thank god none of us got injured
[38:21] i just jumped off the the motorcycle
[38:24] then my sister remained with the baby
[38:27] but we didn't fall down
[38:29] immediately after we left his brother he
[38:31] just ran away and left us there
[38:34] i thank god because the devil wanted to
[38:36] kill us from where exactly we were
[38:38] testifying from
[38:39] that very place where we were i thank
[38:42] god for that
[38:47] then another thing
[38:48] it's about my son
[38:51] he has been sick for about five months
[38:54] suffering from chest infection
[38:57] it's been so
[38:59] tough
[39:00] we tried all the medicine they put him
[39:03] on injections they all failed
[39:06] you know i lost the brother to asthma
[39:09] now my son had started struggling to
[39:11] breathe like the way my brother was
[39:13] struggling
[39:15] i felt like i thought this boy had got
[39:18] asthma
[39:20] i lost hope i was just there but i thank
[39:23] god
[39:24] whenever i'm weak
[39:26] he walks through my husband to lift me
[39:28] up
[39:29] he told me that let's commit this one to
[39:32] god
[39:33] we prayed it took a short time like
[39:36] within one week the boy was okay
[39:39] now it took it has just taken like two
[39:42] weeks when i'm sleeping very well you
[39:44] know those days i used to sleep and you
[39:47] think i'm sleeping with a pig inside
[39:50] he could breathe very badly but i thank
[39:53] god my son is now very okay
[39:59] and the last testimony

[40:05] sometimes we miss the service because of
[40:08] transport means sometimes on wednesday
[40:11] when we finish the service late
[40:14] we sometimes we could walk up to home
[40:17] because we we are not getting the means
[40:19] to go
[40:20] but i thank god that he gave us a brand
[40:24] new motorcycle
[40:27] i blessed the name of the lord for that
[40:30] he has taken us from far
[40:33] no one thought this would happen because
[40:36] our beginning was so small
[40:39] but i thank god for the fires taking us
[40:42] may god bless you

[1:05:01] bibles of faith
[1:05:03] [Music]
[1:05:19] i think
[1:05:20] just got straight away to the scriptures
[1:05:22] for now no is that you never tell
[1:05:24] everybody
[1:05:28] chapter three of the book of luke
[1:05:30] is
[1:05:44] and we read from verse 39.
[1:05:48] true
[1:06:06] and one of the male factors which were
[1:06:09] hanged
[1:06:10] railed on him saying if thou be christ
[1:06:14] save thyself and us
[1:06:17] but the other answering rebuked him
[1:06:19] saying thus to thou not fear god
[1:06:22] seeing thou art in the same condemnation
[1:06:26] does thou not fear god
[1:06:28] seeing
[1:06:31] seeing that thou art in the same
[1:06:33] condemnation
[1:06:34] and we indeed justly
[1:06:36] for we receive the dear reward
[1:06:39] of our deeds
[1:06:40] but this man has done nothing amiss
[1:06:44] and he said unto jesus lord
[1:06:47] remember me
[1:06:49] when thou comest
[1:06:51] into thy kingdom
[1:06:52] and jesus said unto him
[1:06:54] verily i say
[1:06:57] verily i say unto thee
[1:07:00] today shalt thou be with me
[1:07:03] in paradise
[1:07:06] verily i say unto thee
[1:07:08] today shalt thou would be with me in
[1:07:11] paradise you can read that brother luca

[1:08:41] morning i just want to straight i feel
[1:08:42] too straight i'll go to the world
[1:08:44] in trouble
[1:08:49] and i'm speaking on an encounter with a
[1:08:51] living god
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:56] an encounter with a living god
[1:08:59] canonical
[1:09:01] the gospel ng
[1:09:03] this is maybe for an inspiration
[1:09:09] is a destiny changer
[1:09:14] the gospel angel is a destiny change a
[1:09:18] true son
[1:09:33] maybe i'll not speak for long i do not
[1:09:34] know
[1:09:38] about something really on my heart
[1:09:42] on my heart to speak to you
[1:09:46] pray for
[1:10:00] [Music]
[1:10:02] it is not it is a story but more than a
[1:10:05] story
[1:10:09] that's why some people have not accepted
[1:10:12] in the existence of god
[1:10:17] because to them it was
[1:10:20] something that seemed impossible
[1:10:25] to them
[1:10:26] a spirit or something that could create
[1:10:29] something from nothing seems like a
[1:10:31] fable
[1:10:38] there is no proof to that fact
[1:11:06] because man was actually meant in the
[1:11:08] beginning to be in the image of god
[1:12:01] then i've got a seed a seed replace the
[1:12:04] seed to replace
[1:12:06] cane
[1:12:21] um who is it that saith was in the image
[1:12:24] of god of
[1:12:25] adam he says the anime defender nature
[1:12:28] adam that saith was begot that saith was
[1:12:32] in the image of adam and he says he had
[1:12:34] furniture
[1:12:36] sometimes and for a long time i've
[1:12:38] actually thought it to be that way
[1:12:42] that went your fault that because saith
[1:12:44] was in the image of adam now then
[1:12:47] says furniture adam and adam was in the
[1:12:49] image of god
[1:12:51] in furniture
[1:12:52] it was in the image of god
[1:12:54] that says they are in furniture but that
[1:12:56] would mean that every human being that
[1:12:58] is born is in the image of god
[1:13:14] adam was not in the image of god
[1:13:28] [Applause]
[1:13:30] he lost his glory
[1:13:55] [Music]
[1:13:56] no matter which family you were born
[1:14:13] because adam was not able to pass on the
[1:14:16] life of god to his children
[1:14:22] because he lost
[1:14:24] he lost that that life
[1:14:39] [Applause]
[1:14:40] destiny
[1:15:09] character of jesus
[1:15:20] and his destiny was changed permanently
[1:15:48] destiny means
[1:15:50] what happens in the future
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:56] the thing that someone or something will
[1:15:58] experience in the future
[1:16:03] destiny means a power i'm again
[1:16:07] that is believed to control what happens
[1:16:09] in the future
[1:16:15] so you see that now when when adam was
[1:16:18] born in the image of god
[1:16:22] he had this power around him
[1:16:25] that was controlling what will happen to
[1:16:28] him in the future
[1:16:32] and that could not
[1:16:58] and of course i know there are people
[1:17:00] who believe that your destiny cannot be
[1:17:01] changed my new idea
[1:17:03] they're going to get sober at you i will
[1:17:05] prove that to you by the bible today
[1:17:08] actually your destiny can be changed by
[1:17:10] your actions
[1:17:28] to
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:58] [Applause]
[1:18:10] you can open
[1:18:18] [Applause]
[1:18:25] group can be able to drive your you know
[1:18:27] well of course the destiny is something
[1:18:28] that will happen in the future i'm again
[1:18:31] the church in twitching over our muscle
[1:18:33] as much as we do not know what will
[1:18:35] happen
[1:18:38] and we say we have
[1:19:23] [Music]
[1:19:46] as the soul of the father so also
[1:20:20] it shall die
[1:20:23] the soul that sinneth amen
[1:20:26] it shall die
[1:20:28] so in other words the soul a man that
[1:20:32] decides to sin he
[1:20:35] is that soul
[1:20:37] [Music]
[1:20:40] please follow me here now
[1:20:42] look at verse 20.
[1:20:57] the sun shall not bear the iniquity of
[1:20:59] the father
[1:21:04] shall the father bear the iniquity of
[1:21:06] the son
[1:21:10] the righteousness
[1:21:11] of the righteous shall be upon him
[1:21:17] and the wickedness of the wicked shall
[1:21:19] be upon him
[1:21:22] yet so now the decisions that i make
[1:21:27] cannot listen please cannot necessarily
[1:21:30] mold the destiny of my children
[1:21:37] the things that your father did have
[1:21:40] been teaching
[1:21:55] together color code cannot determine
[1:21:57] your destiny maybe someone has sent home
[1:21:59] again the decision of someone else
[1:22:03] cannot influence your destiny
[1:22:06] it can frustrate your present time and
[1:22:09] he said that you got to change it
[1:22:11] because of those things already in 12
[1:22:13] years someone else has gone on to yeah
[1:22:16] because they can make your life hard or
[1:22:18] want to be accused of you so can't wait
[1:22:20] to make your life easy
[1:22:22] oh it can you know try to change you a
[1:22:24] little bit during that moment
[1:22:28] now you cannot determine your destiny
[1:22:32] maybe someone has said a woman again ago
[1:22:34] cannot shape what you will
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:49] because of what my mother did or what my
[1:23:20] [Music]
[1:23:30] the righteousness of the righteous shall
[1:23:32] be upon him
[1:23:46] the
[1:23:55] he cannot judge you for someone else's
[1:23:57] mistake
[1:24:14] hallelujah amen the bible said we may
[1:24:16] not even know what we shall be bible
[1:24:18] again
[1:24:20] but we know you're two man when he comes
[1:24:26] why does the bible say happy
[1:24:28] righteousness
[1:24:44] that destiny is a power that is believed
[1:24:46] to control what happens
[1:24:53] a man is destiny
[1:24:56] can be changed in just a moment
[1:25:04] one moment i can say that
[1:25:07] i can change you at this point
[1:25:10] again
[1:25:39] again forever
[1:25:42] and the bible says i believe he died
[1:25:45] because the soul that sees that son
[1:25:47] shall die
[1:25:51] and of course death means a total
[1:25:53] separation from god
[1:25:58] and of course we know that the bible
[1:26:00] says one day he's like a thousand years
[1:26:02] unto the lord and one thousand years
[1:26:04] like a day unto the lord
[1:26:22] foreign
[1:27:29] and the destiny of all those
[1:27:44] can
[1:27:58] you know it cannot affect us that's just
[1:28:00] someone that took ourselves if we can be
[1:28:01] able to live without sin seeing not to
[1:28:04] wear our water but because the nature of
[1:28:06] adam
[1:28:08] anger will turn the water
[1:28:09] on down to us
[1:28:12] the fallen
[1:28:25] would not do any better
[1:28:53] much
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:50] so
[1:30:04] amen another opportunity
[1:30:07] was made a reality
[1:30:09] on the cross
[1:30:11] when jesus was on the cross yes
[1:30:14] opportunity
[1:30:15] became a reality
[1:30:22] and so
[1:30:24] knowledge
[1:30:27] one encounter
[1:30:29] all this is in canada

[1:31:24] another one was a good man
[1:31:26] he was this jesus we're talking about
[1:31:55] [Music]
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:33:48] one encounter with
[1:33:52] [Applause]
[1:33:58] [Applause]
[1:33:59] [Music]
[1:34:14] is
[1:34:45] there is a problem somewhere why not why
[1:34:47] do you want to see what i want to
[1:34:49] yeah of course

[1:34:52] have a sinkhole and have an encounter
[1:34:55] with him never financing canada their
[1:34:57] life doesn't change

[1:35:40] who was
[1:35:55] christian
[1:35:56] save
[1:35:57] yourself well call it
[1:36:00] and save us enough for to record
[1:36:02] this was the man on the left
[1:36:05] save yourself when you call it and save
[1:36:07] enough
[1:36:22] this man
[1:36:46] [Music]
[1:37:02] if this message is true
[1:37:15] [Music]
[1:37:18] does not know jesus
[1:37:22] that's a language on a limit of people
[1:37:26] whose destiny
[1:37:28] may never change
[1:38:14] of jesus
[1:38:39] oh
[1:38:55] they can say everything they want
[1:39:06] hallelujah
[1:39:14] [Music]
[1:39:25] [Music]
[1:39:37] [Music]
[1:39:38] is reason these people some of them
[1:39:41] believe the message
[1:39:45] because they never believed during the
[1:39:46] first place
[1:39:59] [Music]
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:06] and forever
[1:40:10] and so this other man
[1:40:12] turns to this other man whom said you
[1:40:14] walk with the nature okay
[1:40:17] and he rebuked him
[1:40:18] now
[1:40:19] a true believer
[1:40:22] anyone who tries to talk the word
[1:40:33] in the same condemnation
[1:40:47] we are in this condemnation
[1:40:50] [Music]
[1:40:52] because we are sinners
[1:40:55] so it is just category to sunny day
[1:40:59] hellbounds
[1:41:02] sinful creatures
[1:41:20] can't you see
[1:41:23] the man
[1:41:46] we deserve it
[1:41:48] and that's how all of us were where'd
[1:41:50] your friend never dwell
[1:41:54] but this man naomi said you know has
[1:41:57] done nothing i missed karina
[1:42:01] the reason why jesus was chad
[1:42:03] was uh hungry on the cross
[1:42:09] because he died
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:26] foreign
[1:42:54] jesus
[1:42:56] if you be the christ oh that's the
[1:42:58] crystal if you are anointed like they
[1:43:00] say you are already kind of dangerous
[1:43:02] save yourself
[1:43:04] save us
[1:43:06] he could he did not know
[1:43:08] if jesus saved himself yesterday
[1:43:12] we could not save them
[1:43:15] if jesus served himself
[1:43:18] yes
[1:43:19] he would not save you
[1:43:23] he had to take the condemnation
[1:43:27] belonging to you
[1:43:30] so that you
[1:43:31] wait
[1:43:32] the righteousness
[1:43:35] that belongs to you
[1:43:37] your way it was an exchange why did
[1:43:40] you say destiny
[1:43:45] and of course when he took the sins that
[1:43:47] belong to you
[1:43:50] it never changed his destiny maybe i
[1:43:53] chose him again because he was the
[1:43:55] destiny maker
[1:44:00] and so here he is on the cross
[1:44:03] and this man did not realize who jesus
[1:44:07] was
[1:44:08] yes
[1:44:09] and he still you know ridiculed him and
[1:44:11] needed anything he wanted to do
[1:44:13] become very strong
[1:44:15] but this other man you know good night
[1:44:31] this man recognized

[3:22:29] um
[3:22:31] we we want to hit our target targets
[3:22:36] i i do not know about you
[3:22:41] but as for me
[3:22:43] we started this
[3:22:45] not to fail
[3:23:09] but that should not mean that we should
[3:23:11] not
[3:23:13] uh push forward to our goals
[3:23:22] when god came to moses
[3:23:25] i asked him what do you have
[3:23:29] and god gave him much more katundan
[3:23:33] singapore but he started with a stick a
[3:23:35] road which he had
[3:23:37] attended
[3:23:39] and so
[3:23:40] what we have
[3:23:41] chaturinakat let's give it to the work
[3:23:43] of the lord
[3:23:45] come and let us give it cheerfully to
[3:23:47] where you need you and whenever you give
[3:23:49] cheerfully and that would go away in the
[3:23:51] sun you are bound to be blessed
[3:23:54] my guardian to take it away is that true
[3:23:57] it's truth the bible says god loves
[3:23:59] achieve forgiveness
[3:24:02] i sincerely believe
[3:24:04] it is a muslim but each of us here
[3:24:08] from the little children
[3:24:16] [Music]
[3:24:25] still back at you
[3:24:27] as you're waiting for the lord to open a
[3:24:29] way for you
[3:24:32] even if you say every day i'm going to
[3:24:34] keep one thousand or two thousand
[3:24:35] members
[3:24:38] of
[3:24:39] 500.
[3:24:40] on sunday i will take it as my place
[3:24:44] the lord will bless them
[3:24:47] but i do not think it is right
[3:24:50] if we believe in this vision
[3:25:06] our incomes are not the same
[3:25:08] stupendouses
[3:25:10] about
[3:25:11] how much you are going to give so get a
[3:25:13] coupon
[3:25:15] whether or not you are giving something
[3:25:20] because this is not to enrich me
[3:25:26] we are not collecting money to buy
[3:25:28] the pasta a new car
[3:25:32] motorhome charges
[3:25:36] we are not collecting money to buy the
[3:25:37] pasta new house
[3:25:42] we are collecting money to build to buy
[3:25:45] land so we can build
[3:25:46] a tabernacle
[3:25:51] a place where mothers
[3:25:52] can deal with their children in a good
[3:25:54] atmosphere
[3:25:59] you know
[3:26:00] where they can be able to feed them the
[3:26:03] best of our bodies
[3:26:04] where we can have enough space
[3:26:11] and for those who would join us
[3:26:14] some people don't even feel comfortable
[3:26:16] to come because they feel the place is
[3:26:18] so squeezed and so hard
[3:26:24] and i also believe that when we have a
[3:26:27] good atmosphere a good spacious place
[3:26:29] iran's regression to a tremendous
[3:26:58] you should give something towards the
[3:27:00] fulfillment of your pledge those who are
