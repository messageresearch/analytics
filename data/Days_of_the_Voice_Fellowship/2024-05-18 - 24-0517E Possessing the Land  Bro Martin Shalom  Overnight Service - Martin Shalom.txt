we pray amen yeah we reading uh from The Book of Joshua Joshua chapter 5 beginning from verses two it says that at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made uh made him sharp knives and circumcised the children of Israel at at the at the the hill the hill of the forest skin and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all the people that came out of Egypt that were male even all the men of War died in the wilderness by the way after they came out of Egypt now all the people that came out were were circumcised but all the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as as they came forth out of Egypt they came forth out of Egypt then them they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness till all the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed because they obeyed not the voice of the Lord unto whom whom the Lord swear that he would not show them the land which the Lord swear unto their father that he would give us a land that floweth with milk and honey and their children whom uh he raised up in state in their state them josa circumcised for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way it came to pass when they had done circumcising that all the people that they Abode in their places in the camp till they were whole and the Lord said unto 1 verse 6 says the Lord Our God spake unto us in Horeb saying ye have dwelt long enough in this moment then you you read the you read up to eight 6 seven and 8 turn you and take your journey and go to the Mount of the amorites and unto all the places n there unto in the plain in the hills and in the veil and in the South by the seaside to the land of the Canaanites and unto Lebanon and to the Great River and the river Euphrates behold I have set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord's s unto your fathers Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to their SE no oh it's eight from vers 8 where it says uh okay let me read from six it says the Lord Our God spake unto as in Horeb saying you have dwelt long enough in this mountain blessed be the name of the Lord uh I want us today to pick it from the mountain which God was pointing the sh of Israelite and I don't know which mountain you have dwelt on blessed be the name of the Lord you see this people they had uh when they came out of the land of uh of Egypt and as they moving toward the promised land they reach somewhere and they kind of relaxed blessed be the name of the Lord but remember the promise was the promised land praise be to God and the prophet tells us that uh this was the first Exodus of the children of Israelite from their land of bondage to the promised land and he preached the message called the third EX Exodus and he say today the church is in another Exodus blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God and we seeing the first Exodus they had Moses and they had Joshua they had Caleb and in this Exodus I always believe that we are the generation who did not see our Moses blessed be the name of the Lord but we have the Joshua who is the Holy Ghost leading the church to the promised land blessed be the name of the Lord amen so here God came down and the Lord spake unto us the Lord spoke to the congregation in HB saying you have dwelt long enough in this mountain turn you and take your journey and go to the mountain of the Amorite not to the free Mountain amen the mountains where they're supposed to turn and go around had their owners in fact had the SCS blessed be the name of the Lord Lord so God told them turn and go to the mountain of the Amorite and unto the places uh near there unto in the plain in the hills and in the veil and in the South and by the seaside to the land of the Canaanite and unto Lebanon unto Great River the eph river behold La I have set the land before you blessed be the name of the Lord they had to go I saw somebody who resembl sister oh you're welcome God bless you yeah we happy to see you the Lord said unto uh okay turn and take your journey and go to the mountain of the Amorite you have dwelt long enough here now turn go to the mountain of the Amorite and unto the places n there unto the plain in the Hills all day before and in the veil in the South and by the seaside to the land of Canaan Canaanite blessed be the name of the Lord all these things we meet them alongside our J the promised land it is not a straight road blessed be the name of the Lord in the South and by the seaside to the land of the Canaanite and unto uh unto leban andto the Great River the river eph behold after all this laa I set the land before you go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your father Abraham Isaac and Jacob to give unto them and to and to their seed after them there is a land which God had sweared unto the unto their fathers the Father Abraham Isaac Jacob to give theion of Israelite amen and God is reminding them and today I'm also reminding you that there is a land blessed be the name of the Lord which you and me have got to possess and if you read this message so far I don't know how many you have read but all the message that I have read so far point us to this land and that's why once in a while or if not every time we need to remind ourself about that land because when God came down to remind Israelite brother Paul amen about their promise the church has a promise in this last hour we have the promise of the Rapture amen and we know that Christ is coming to take the church without spot or wrinkle and we know that the church the going of the church it is in process blessed with the name of the Lord amen we know that the bride is being prepared by the preaching of the word praise be to God if you feel you are dozing I reest you to stand even if the whole church stand it is okay provid that you are listening and you are swallowing blessed be the name of the Lord and you hardly find normally people who does in church praise be to God it is sinen to those in church it is Unbecoming it is disrespect respect to those in church blessed be the name of the Lord God is speaking and you are dozing and you are deceived that you're going to God's heaven may God help us blessed be the name of the Lord when you are going to God's heaven you must be sober because he said be sober and Vigilant praise be to God it is the devil the devil is the one who does this in church because the word BS the devil it's none of his business when he's in church he has no business there he will try amen he has to make you do and when you go out he keeps you active doing the opposite blessed be the name of the Lord a serious Christian cannot dose in church a real believer will not dose in church why did you leave your bed to come here you have a nice bed and blessed be the name of the Lord yeah what I'm trying to say do not allow the devil to use that b and I know the devil is not a Happ about what we are talking about because the life of the Christian is the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is our Promised Land blessed be the name of the Lord after all our struggle and all our battles we know that there is a land that God has prepared for us and God told them he reminded them about that land and he told them go in and possess the land this land is supposed to be possessed by individuals you cannot sit at home and your father God and possess for you the land blessed be the name of the Lord because each one of us has his position that's why God designed it in the way that even your father cannot possess for you neither you are mother you have to go possess for yourself that's why when God came down uh that's why uh calb went to Joshua and told him give me my Mountain the Lord promised us for 40 years ago I'm still having the same strength just show me give me my Mountain blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to quote in this message the prophet tells us that uh the trouble of it is with people today they are trying to depend on experience they had about 20 years ago you know what happened and to that manner it got wiggle taals in it overnight we must get experience we must be getting experience almost every day blessed be the name of the Lord and the prophet say the trouble with the people today they are trying to depend on unexperienced but there are those who have never even gotten an experience praise be to God and at that time at that same time that this devil falls out of heaven and became incarnate in man the Holy Spirit goes up and came down incarnate incarnate man amen oh my what a Time blessed be the name of the Lord amen go in and possess the land you cannot possess the land from out we must go in blessed be the name of the Lord amen and uh here in Joshua where we read Joshua chapter 5 it says that uh this is chapter 311 chapter 3: 11 it says that behold the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of all the Earth passes over before you into Jordan now therefore take you 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of every tribe a man and shall come to pass as soon as the soul of the feet of the priest that bear the Ark of the Lord the lord of the all the Earth shall rest in the waters of Jordan that the the Waters of Jordan shall be cut out from the waters that came down from above and they shall stand upon an hip and it came to pass when the people removed from their tent tend to pass over Jordan and the priest bearing the Ark of the Covenant before the people and as they that bear the ark where came into Jordan that the feet of the priest that bear the ark were in the brim of water of Jordan overflow of all his Banks all the time of the Harvest that the water which came down from above stood and Rose up and Rose up and Heap very far from the city Adam that is beside amen and the time and here in chapter 5 you say at that time the Lord said unto Joshua make thee a sharp knife blessed be the name of the Lord when God called Israelites in their Journey to the promised land ah they started their Journey God gave them the promise but the Bible tells us that of all those who came the two million who came out of Egypt is only the two who made it the promised land and out of the two that was Joshua and calb and then apart from it's only those who were born in the wilderness they the one who made it to the promised land amen with are two the from the old generation and the prophet tells us that uh the reason asked why they are cut off we know it's because they disbelieved God when they rebelled against God and against Moses and they doubted God they murmured against Moses they murmured against God and God became annoyed with them until God even decided to destroy them in the bible say that Moses stood between them and God and said that what will the world say what will other nations say that you are not even able to deliver them blessed be the name of the Lord I want us to see something here but still they perish in the wilderness blessed be the name of the Lord God had to make them roam in the wilderness for another 40 years amen until all those who came out of Egypt where no more to be seen blessed be the name of the Lord K if you look at like uh look at Ahab when Ahab killed nabo you remember the plot how Jezebel nabo had a very nice land piece of land and uh Ahab admired it he wanted this man to sell him that piece of land and the man refused told him I cannot sell my inheritance and the bible say that Ahab went home and he was so sad in his heart and maybe Jezebel had gone to The Women's Circle from saving amen so when she came home she B the husband was so sad and asked the king what is wrong with you said na has refused to sell me his land said what kind of King is you you the holy king so the Bible says the woman plotted made a plot to kill naboth and nabo was killed and after after the king had murdered nabo the bible say that God spoke to Elijah and told him go quickly and meet Ahab and tell him you have taken the man's land and even killing him you have killed him you have murdered him and then because of that God declared judgment upon Ahab God told Ahab that you children those who will be died in the city they will be eaten by dogs those who will die in the wildness they will be eaten by the carcasses blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible says this man went before God he humbled himself he repented and the and God said that are you seeing how my servant Ahab has humbled himself so he sent the prophet to tell him that go tell him that uh whatever is said it will come to pass but after when he's dead blessed be the name of the Lord in other [Music] words God did not take the punishment away but God prolonged it amen and say that those thing will not happen they will happen when you are not there blessed be the name of the Lord that is the same thing that of Israel when Moses stood between them and God God did not change his mind about about his word amen his word settled forever in heaven and because of that God had another method of eliminating them he had to make them move in the wilderness until all of them died blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible tells us in uh in Joshua chapter 5 that after all that had happened time came because remember these people were not circumcised they were born in the wilderness and the law of God was that all of all of the Jews they are supposed to be circumcised blessed be the name of the Lord and God spoke to Joshua and told him here that it came to pass uh uh at that time God the Lord said unto Joshua make the sharp knives and circumcise again the uh again the children of Israel the second time and Joshua made a sharp knife and knives and circumcised the children of Israel at the hill of the forest skin blessed be the name of the Lord they could not go to the promised land without circumcision and the same thing appli to the church the church will never go the Rapture without the holy spirit amen this one was physical circumcision but the circumcision we are receiving that is the circumcision of the Heart by the knife amen of the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] how much more the church today because this was even physical land blessed be the name of the Lord how about the spiritual to the spiritual Israelites praise be to God Amen and this is and and this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise all all the people that came out of Egypt uh that were male even the men of War died in the wildness by the way after they came out of Egypt Egypt now all the people that came out of out were circumcised but the people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt they had not circumcised for the children of Israel walked 40 years in the wildness still the people that were Men of War which came out of Egypt were consumed the men of War had to be consumed amen blessed be the name of the Lord and sometime even Christian are deceived and they think that God is working at their mercies blessed be the name of the Lord we are saved by Amazing Grace unmerited favor we did not deserve amen but God by his sovereign Grace saved us he had mercy on us he had sympathy on us amen that's why that man sang a song and say we owe a Deb we could not pay Jesus Paid the debt he did not owe why because we needed somebody to wash our sins away blessed be the name of the Lord the price which Jesus Paid no rich man would manage no president no King no Pope blessed be the name of the Lord it had to take the blood of God himself so brethren we are at God's mercy but still God did not do everything Jesus said indeed it is finished and that is true but you have got a role to play and when it comes to our part we want to bypass [Applause] amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God there is no shortcut Friends new birth is a must there's no way we can dodge it and you will never it's just like death only those who are going to dodge death are those who will be found when they are still alive blessed be the name of the Lord and it's because they died long ago and they are now risen in Christ Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen so Kon when God speaks God means his word and if we can just know or understand I know we know but sometime understanding it that's where the problem comes from because when Jesus told nicodem unless a man is born again he cannot even understand he cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven brother how are we going to see how do you think how are you going to see the kingom of heaven without being born again even the message will not understand it you will not even you will pretend that you're believing it without that we cannot even understand the message amen praise be to God go in and possess the land we have a land to possess and that's the land of the Holy Ghost that is the buer land that is the land of Joy the land of Peace the land of overcoming the land of Victory amen the land of Deliverance blessed be the name of the Lord if you just belong to to denomination if you are Pentecostal grandchild God don't have any grandchildren soon even in the message we're going to have grandchildren for me my grandfather was a message Pastor my father is a deacon or a pastor my brother is an Asher my niece is a musician that does not guarantee you amen you have to arise go possess the land being a message believer is more than just coming to church it is more than reading the message but it's knowing where you are standing it's knowing who you are it's knowing what you stand for amen it's being sure that you have met the requirement it's being sure that the token is applied amen I don't care how much you read about the token how much you sing about it the blood was presented mercy walked in that is not enough coming to church is not enough you must have an experience with God what brings us here is to have more of God in us you need an experience praise be to God something must happen we must have a different testimony moving from flu testimony I was battling with flu but God has said has delivered me no that one is okay but it's not enough even Pentecostal they even have bigger testimonies how about the message Believers we want a message we want a testimony of New Birth brother I've been praying for two months now God F me the Holy Ghost last night amen that is what you want to hear I've been asking God about this but God came down and told me a b c d that is what will make you grounded why do you waste your time coming to church you come and sit you kneel in front of the shair and you sleep when they sing till we me praise be to God Amen [Music] am but that is the truth praise be to God what is going to stabilize us is the holy spirit it is that experience don't think that when you marry that's when you're going to be stable you are deceived you better be stable now you better be serious now you better pray now fast now amen serve God now sing to him now jump to him now amen don't wait until you get married that's another story praise be to God God sent us this message to stabilize us we were moving from Pillar To Post Jehovah Witness to Adventist adven to Islam Islams to bisha bisha to we were just moving but when God sent us the message he told us now the time has come amen when you will no longer go to Mir you not go toine but the true worshipers they are worshiping God in the word and the prophet preached the message God is chosen place of worship amen you are worshiping God in his in his chosen place place and you are dosing in the service really that can't be we are not in the mock praise be to God hallelujah we must be stabilized you must have they had seen something unique something worth to die for blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why the prophet say that if you're not ready if you're not worth to die you're not even worth to Le us preaching it is high time we go back and do inventory in our lives and ask yourself am I moving toward the promised land you see I was thinking about this today of the people here had to cleanse himself then come people were on their and when the priest died inside there nobody could go there to pull him or to pick him they had to pull the what he had to wear a bell with a long Rob every time here Jing kingling you know the man is still alive jingling kingling the Rob moves as he moves because he was taking the sacrifice of the people and when that man reached there and you hear no sound and no what they just had to pull the rope and the congregation think they just laughing they even on whatsa there when you see a Deon coming then you change the the screen you were deceived by the devil you are suffing you are doing this and this you find someone with five open screens when come then you put the one of songs and then you wonder the what is going on you on honly belief you try to compare and it's not coming it used not to be like like that with the Israelite they were on Amen we also ought to be on because here either you go back with life or death shees you this day blessed be the name of the Lord but I want to tell you Brethren there is a land of the Holy Spirit there is a place where God want the church to be there is a place where God want believer us to be where a brother is going to be a brother to you where worship will be worship you will not be irritated by the word but will appreciate the word let us not be formal kind of Believers so formal they sit and they put their they put their head on the wall and the words going and someone's just pulling the even what he pulling is not there it's like how you speak I know all brother sister praise be to God it is by the grace that you are saved and last time Pastor reminded us that we are the wild Branch God had to cut the wild branch and grafted it there but it's not going to be there forever one of these days amen wait it's okay it's cool brother but one of these days when the door will close no preached the message for 120 days it's 120 years right yeah 120 years sorry the man preached people came and attend Revival let us go help that old man of nowadays that brother is also too much he shouts a lot that's why for me noways I've even moved from in I'm sitting behind you be behind there they start with this one in front let us go first not those who are seated behind so you be there let us go help him even in the Church of Believers there are people think they H the church let us go and make more numbers receive the Holy Ghost be born again be a real Christian be a real believer be a real message believer a true worshiper be a prayer warri are you the world they have star I'm Ronaldo I want to be like was you hear kids so what what but who are you are you s are you s Warrior praise be to God sometime we need to pinch [Music] our from Monday to Monday brethren we are stewards God borrowed us this life you are going to give account you are going to account for that life you are having these hands how did you use them for pointing people and threatening them I will crush you whatever we have does not belong to us it is for the glory of God praise be to God are you using your hands for his glory are you using your voice for his glory are you using your eyes for his glory what are using you are s for because one of these days we are going to be called home you find them say my my finger is like a like a fing like aale finger are you a people say when I speak I speak like a muu you are deceived you are impersonator praise be to God what I'm trying to say there is something so real in fact God is so real God is a person I mean it's so real that when you're with God it's not just a guess work there is a God who is real there is a real healings there is a real Miracle there is a real visitation there is a true worship where you worship and you feel really God comes and touches you there is a real praying where you pray until you feel you are connected there is a real seeking God where you go on your knees and you say God uhuh I don't understand these things but now I've come you pray things are hard you press on you push on until you he comes down and walks around the room we need something so real I'm here to tell you let us go and possess the land let us go deep amen the reason I ask why you don't want to go deep is because you don't want to part with your sins but you better destroy your enemy before he destroys you that when I get in the spirit I will cry and sister son so will see me shame on you you think sister son so want car Brothers for me today my suit is so nice I cannot even kneel down you are deceived that is the devil's Pride if I Prophet Isaac could come before God and cry like a baby who are you John said that he thought he was dead when the presence of God comes down the reason as why you cannot kneel down is because you are sting you are stiff praise be to God let us open to the Holy Ghost let us surrender let us learn to surrender ourself and heal ourself in the presence of God Amen that when we come in the presence of God like this there is no greater one and smaller one all of us we are little one and God is the greater one blessed be the name of the Lord that is what God demands from us we come with that humility with that sincerity amen saying that God I am nobody it's only you can make me somebody and now I have come if you don't help me I'm gone Lord help me brother cry to god sister don't get scared of Brother Martin I don't have heaven for you cry to your papa for me whatever I do for God I do it wholeheartedly when I'm clapping I mean clapping why would somebody plead a minister plead let me tell you you will lack words to tell God that God if you heal my hands I will clap for you like like lightening or like Thunder God will just look at you say look at this little hypocrite because when you had it you did not do that Keek had something to convince god with he told God I have walked perfect before you for all these years and now here is the message amen maybe had an expecting mother like me he looked at he looked at n said ah she's delivering very soon and now if I go what happening no no no no no no I cannot go he had reasons he had something to convince God With God I cannot die until God added him more 15 years as the prophet was going back singing God have delivered you I Surrender I Surrender oh maybe was singing touch my body touch has deliver the message God told him go back go go back and when the man was there facing the wall he was still praying amen sometime you pray and when something is about to happen you can tell maybe this man was happy now in the spirit he was just laughing say God thank you Jesus thank you because I'm not going to die and there the prophet appeared and said thus says the Lord you are not going to die God has added you more years he had something to convince God to what do you have what can you tell God today he a fortunate if God can say fortunate my daughter I'm taking you home uhhuh you going to die what you going say oh God have not even finished campus have not even my blessed be the name of the Lord what am I trying to say better amen n [Music] may God help us we need the Holy Ghost praise be to God brother bam says that when he was young when he was with his brother they used to like when they meet but do you know what they used to do say they used to come and blessed is the name of the Lord so there are some brother totoys and sister totoys they need the Holy Ghost Fire amen and when God Ray that Holy Ghost Fire on them guess what they will sit onen they are preparing to amend the word because something happened Brethren God the reason asked why God told them you have stayed here so long go this way and possess the land go go and go in the land and possess it you cannot possess it from outside you have to come in it and you possess it because God knew that these people were comfortable for nothing amen the real Joy was in the promised land Brethren the real Joy is in the Holy Ghost the real pray is in the Holy Ghost the real singing is in the Holy Ghost the real meing of the word is in the Holy Ghost Amen Let Us enter in the holy of holies where the Mana is fresh 24/7 that's where God want you to be amen where Aron's Road was put and it bed within 12 hours or 24 hours that's where God want the church to be that's where God want every brother and every sister to be there there is a land that is real when you enter there even your way of seeing message will differ you say that all but the devil want to keep you out because you are moving with some you remember what the the devil told Pharaoh told Moses you see and that is the same trick of the devil today because this is another [Music] Exodus because there he can access you but brother sister let me tell you there is a place where God can put a Believer and the devil has nothing to do with him amen the prophet says that God want to put us where the devil will get mad about us because he can hardly cannot reach you and every time the devil see you pushing see you pressing he comes and thow stumbling block you think you
