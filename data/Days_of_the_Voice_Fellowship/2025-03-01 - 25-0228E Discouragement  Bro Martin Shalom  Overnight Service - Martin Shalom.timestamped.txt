[1:15:43] of the king is in
[1:15:50] the come Lord and have your own
[1:15:53] way take the
[1:15:56] preeminence in Christ Jesus we
[1:15:59] pray
[1:16:02] amen you may have your
[1:16:05] seats
[1:16:12] amen uh where we have read brother you
[1:16:15] can read in luganda
[1:16:33] amen
[1:16:35] amen uh in verses 41 of the English
[1:16:44] Bible there is somewhere he mentioned
[1:16:46] that uh
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:49] they limited God
[1:16:55] blessed be the name of the Lord amen you
[1:16:57] know when God C of
[1:16:59] Israelite when he called
[1:17:03] them and he told them he was taking the
[1:17:06] promised
[1:17:08] land remember that was after they cry in
[1:17:12] the wilderness H sorry in the sea of
[1:17:19] bondage blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:17:22] and the Lord heard their prayers
[1:17:26] and here Moses God sent
[1:17:30] Moses and after Moses met God in the
[1:17:35] wilderness and God gave him that
[1:17:40] commission amen remember we are in Third
[1:17:44] Exodus that was the first
[1:17:47] Exodus blessed be the name of the
[1:17:50] Lord amen they cried to God because God
[1:17:55] had given them the
[1:17:58] promise and after that
[1:18:01] time they supposed to go back to the
[1:18:04] Homeland blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:18:07] and here God sent them the
[1:18:10] prophet Moses met
[1:18:13] God and God gave him uh signs and
[1:18:18] wonders and told him Aaron will be a
[1:18:21] prophet
[1:18:27] and Moses Moses was
[1:18:31] God blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:18:35] here in
[1:18:36] Psalms the Bible tells us we are seeing
[1:18:41] here that uh they limited
[1:18:44] God blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:18:48] even in this thir
[1:18:50] Exodus let us be careful L we limit God
[1:18:53] also
[1:18:55] because the Bible tells us that whatever
[1:18:58] happened to
[1:19:01] them in the
[1:19:03] wilderness it was for our
[1:19:06] examples praise be to
[1:19:08] God Amen and remember he shall repeat
[1:19:14] himself blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:19:18] whatever happened the children of
[1:19:21] Israel if we say that we are in Third
[1:19:24] Exodus
[1:19:26] the same same thing will happen
[1:19:28] alongside the
[1:19:29] way but depends where you are putting
[1:19:32] your
[1:19:34] focus as long as you're looking at
[1:19:37] God you just know that we are defeating
[1:19:40] the
[1:19:41] enemy blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:19:44] that's why the Bible tells us that we
[1:19:47] should lay aside every
[1:19:50] weight and every sin that was easily set
[1:19:55] us that we run this
[1:19:59] race with
[1:20:01] patience
[1:20:03] amen you must run this race with
[1:20:08] patience we are in the
[1:20:10] race blessed be the name of the Lord we
[1:20:13] are not in
[1:20:15] picnic we are fighting the Lord's
[1:20:18] battle and Jesus himself is the ship
[1:20:22] captain
[1:20:25] and as long as Jesus is commanding the
[1:20:28] battle there's no way we can be
[1:20:32] defeated blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:20:35] and what we supposed to do is H to look
[1:20:39] at God he saying in Matthew
[1:20:42] 11 ver
[1:20:44] 28 come unto me all those who are y with
[1:20:49] heavy
[1:20:50] lad and I will give you
[1:20:53] rest take my my yoke for my yoke is
[1:20:58] light blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:21:01] Jesus is giving us a yoke light a y
[1:21:05] which is
[1:21:07] light praise be to God you canot run
[1:21:11] this
[1:21:13] race when you are caring a lot of WM in
[1:21:18] you you cannot run this
[1:21:20] race with

[2:39:22] seen I'm here because I love you and I'm
[2:39:24] trying to shake you with the gospel out
[2:39:27] of that formal Mo mody condition that

[2:39:56] the spirit amen he said get back to all
[2:39:59] night prayer prayer meeting and and
[2:40:02] something he says here in the message
[2:40:03] just once more time Lord it says
[2:40:06] Pentecost 1963 it says Pentecost a few
[2:40:10] years ago no more than 50 years ago
[2:40:13] stood out the people stood different
[2:40:15] they come out of different groups of
[2:40:17] world worldliness because of their
[2:40:20] worldliness and they stood out as an
[2:40:23] example and God has taken uh that
[2:40:27] church and today it's one of the most
[2:40:30] powerful churches in the world but the
[2:40:32] thing that she is doing she's turned
[2:40:35] right straight back around and went back
[2:40:39] into the same conglomeration that she
[2:40:41] was called out of and when she begins to
[2:40:43] do that her power is taken from her
[2:40:46] where do we get that all night pray pray
[2:40:50] meeting let a preacher preach till about
[2:40:54] 1 or 2:00 in the morning like he used to
[2:40:58] do what time is it now it's almost 1:00
[2:41:01] in the morning he says he says Where do
[2:41:03] we get all that where do we get the all
[2:41:06] night prayer meeting let the preacher
[2:41:08] preach till about 1 or 2:00 in the
[2:41:11] morning like he used to do he would be
[2:41:14] preaching to empty
[2:41:16] seats they go they got to go home and
[2:41:19] see we love Susie or somebody on certain
[2:41:22] television cast you know this used to be
[2:41:25] a program at that time in the 60s or or
[2:41:28] 50s on who who loves Susie it used to be
[2:41:31] like a maybe a so per or something like
[2:41:33] that like I don't know what they have
[2:41:35] today I don't watch those things so I
[2:41:37] don't know if I hope there is no one
[2:41:40] Among Us who follows those so do they
[2:41:42] call
[2:41:43] soas they call it
[2:41:45] Sops and you know those things they put
[2:41:49] on on television you follow follow
[2:41:51] follow follow you know and it is endless
[2:41:54] it seems to be endless they can watch it
[2:41:56] throughout the year and another year and
[2:41:58] you find that someone can't wait they
[2:42:00] can even go almost being knocked by the
[2:42:02] car they want to go and watch that
[2:42:03] program you see Believers are really
[2:42:05] delivered from those things can you say
[2:42:07] Amen we are so glad that we are
[2:42:09] delivered from those things and if you
[2:42:11] still have have it in your house kick it
[2:42:13] out it has no place in a believer's
[2:42:16] home you see but he said that he would
[2:42:18] be preaching you know to empty seats if
[2:42:21] a preacher preached up to 1:00 in the
[2:42:22] morning you would be preaching to empty
[2:42:24] seats I'm so glad we still have a church
[2:42:26] where we can see up to 1:00 in the
[2:42:29] morning amen and the church is not empty
[2:42:32] Hallelujah he says you see be preaching
[2:42:35] to empty C people would get out and they
[2:42:37] go home be watching that those programs
[2:42:39] of who loves Susie or someone on the
[2:42:41] television cast now that's the truth why
[2:42:44] where is your treasure where your
[2:42:46] treasure is that's where your heart is
[2:42:48] also so our Treasures ought to be in the
[2:42:52] word
[2:42:54] amen praise God and we are so glad today
[2:42:58] that our Treasures are in the word and I
[2:43:01] noticed that you know brother bam spoke
[2:43:03] um you know you would call called it all
[2:43:06] night prayer meeting and many times he
[2:43:08] said all night prayer meeting and um um
[2:43:13] you know of course these were Services
[2:43:15] of the word the word was being preached
[2:43:17] and people you know would um have an
[2:43:19] atmosphere where they would speak to the
[2:43:21] Lord I believe we are privileged to
[2:43:23] still have such an opportunity to be
[2:43:24] able to do that there are many many
[2:43:27] churches that no longer have that
[2:43:29] opportunity not only in the Pentecostals
[2:43:31] even the Pentecostals of these days are
[2:43:33] becoming lukewarm cold
[2:43:35] stetchy um so it's a blessing if uh you
[2:43:39] they believe of this message because
[2:43:41] even many in the message they don't have
[2:43:43] time for these kind of things the field
[2:43:45] is um you know a little bit difficult
[2:43:48] and quite frankly many people are busy
[2:43:50] it's a busy Agee everybody is busy you
[2:43:53] know imagine you've been working the
[2:43:55] whole day and now Friday they tell you
[2:43:56] to go for an all night prayer meeting it
[2:43:58] it seems a bit unrealistic to the body
[2:44:01] doesn't it but we are not preparing for
[2:44:04] this body we are preparing for the other
[2:44:06] body and so when we have an opportunity
[2:44:08] like this to come and pray to come and
[2:44:11] be in prayer and and you know hear the
[2:44:13] word sit and hear the word up to 1:00 or
[2:44:16] 2:00 in the morning it's a blessing that
[2:44:18] we can still have that opportunity and
[2:44:21] then we have many needs in the body if
[2:44:23] we have an opportunity to come and
[2:44:25] present them before the Lord and you
[2:44:27] know have some time of prayer like I
[2:44:28] said we are busy you become busy at your
[2:44:30] place of work you become busy at home
[2:44:33] some of you students you become busy
[2:44:35] until you even seldom have time to sit
[2:44:37] down relax and pray but when we have
[2:44:40] this moment of course I believe that
[2:44:42] real prayer is in your prayer closet not
[2:44:45] in a church like this but uh when we are
[2:44:47] gathered like this we can also have some
[2:44:50] little opportunity to worship together
[2:44:51] pray for the collective needs even of
[2:44:54] the Saints and U it's a blessing you
[2:44:57] know um and it's okay if you you push
[2:45:00] your body it's okay amen your body is
[2:45:03] not going to like it but not everybody
[2:45:05] not everything your body likes is good
[2:45:07] so if your body doesn't like it it's
[2:45:09] okay to push it and let your soul
[2:45:12] benefit out of it and I'm sure that by
[2:45:14] the time we leave all of you will be
[2:45:16] refreshed tired in the body but
[2:45:18] refreshed in the spirit shall we stand
[2:45:20] on our on our feet we have a few needs
[2:45:22] that we want to remember as a church
[2:45:25] before the Lord in prayer and um I'll be
[2:45:28] calling shortly brother amram again to
[2:45:30] lead us in a few songs of worship man
[2:45:33] and um to lead us in prayer but we we
[2:45:35] need to remember our brother Emmanuel
[2:45:37] brother Emmanuel uh and and his wife
[2:45:40] have been coming to this church for a
[2:45:41] while now a short while um we I think
[2:45:45] the other week a week last week but one
[2:45:48] my myself and a few brothers and and I
[2:45:51] think one sister we went and had some
[2:45:52] good time at his house he welcomed us at
[2:45:57] his house and um that's when where he
[2:46:00] informed me that he was feeling LED of
[2:46:02] the Holy Spirit to come and join the
[2:46:04] ministry here and um uh so this
[2:46:08] yesterday the he he he was I think on a
[2:46:10] border border in an and and he they
[2:46:14] experienced an accident so we want to
[2:46:17] thank God that uh they has not been as I
[2:46:20] know of any major damage uh but um we
[2:46:24] went and saw him in the hospital today
[2:46:26] he has some kind of wound head injury
[2:46:29] and maybe on his shoulder on um his left
[2:46:34] shoulder and and the the left side of
[2:46:36] the head and maybe a little bit on the
[2:46:39] foot but uh he's generally okay uh the
[2:46:42] doctor say that it is a minor not a
[2:46:44] major one a minor head injury so they
[2:46:47] did not even need to do a CI can uh so
[2:46:50] we we want to thank God for that and um
[2:46:53] it's uh so he's still in the hospital he
[2:46:56] he supposed to be watched for maybe 48
[2:46:58] hours so maybe they may might dismiss
[2:47:00] them tomorrow today today evening uh
[2:47:04] that is Saturday evening so we remember
[2:47:06] we should remember him in prayers his
[2:47:07] wife was uh very worried but I told her
[2:47:11] to relax the Lord is in control and uh
[2:47:13] some brothers came and you know they
[2:47:15] were really helping out we want to thank
[2:47:16] God for that also uh we remember Sister
[2:47:19] Esther Brother Martin mentioned on that
[2:47:21] sister Esther uh has had ulcers and you
[2:47:26] know she she was in pain a lot of pain
[2:47:28] but um she she was taken to moo and I
[2:47:32] think she came out of the hospital today
[2:47:35] uh but we still need to remember her
[2:47:36] that she the Lord will give her uh full
[2:47:39] recovery so these are the needs we have
[2:47:42] and of course many other needs as you
[2:47:43] know um uh in the church here we pray
[2:47:47] for the ministry we pray there are many
[2:47:49] things that we as a church have need of
[2:47:51] I believe when we are gathered like this
[2:47:53] it's good for us to pray for the
[2:47:54] collective needs of the church your
[2:47:57] personal needs and private needs you can
[2:47:58] always pray at home in your prayer
[2:48:00] closet we use this two hours three hours
[2:48:02] that we have to pray for those needs
[2:48:05] praise the Lord so I think we'll sing a
[2:48:07] song and then after that song I will
[2:48:09] invite the brother to come and continue
[2:48:11] leading us uh there's a song I had here

[2:48:16] it yeah I saw the light let us sing that
