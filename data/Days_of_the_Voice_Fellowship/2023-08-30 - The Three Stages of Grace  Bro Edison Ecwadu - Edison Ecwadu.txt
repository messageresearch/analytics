and I pray that father may you circumcise my lips my mind and father and I may get out of the way but father you come down and speak to your children according to the desires of their hearts of God

amen and amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord foreign I am your brother in Christ as I stand here tonight I request that you pray for me and pray with me that God will lead me to speak something that will help you praise the Lord I don't want to come here and speak my mind because if I speak my mind it will poison your soul praise the Lord but if the spirit comes to take control I believe at the end of this service you'll be blessed blessed be the name of the Lord and without wasting your mantras to read the book of Ephesians turn with me to the book of Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 following ah I'm going to speak for yesterday a few minutes and we see what the Lord has for us tonight Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 reads and he and you has he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wearing in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now walketh in the children of Disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in time past in the last of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and of the mind and where by Nature the children of Wrath even us others but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin hath quickened us together with Christ Jesus by Grace you are saved father we thank you we have read your word and your word says that the letter kills but your spirit gives life father we pray come and interpret the scriptures we do not know we don't have understanding of the word but father you are your own interpreter we do not want to put our mind in your word but father you come down and interpret your word unto us that father we shall be edified we bless your name we thank you granted father in Jesus name we pray and believe amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord I thank God for these uh wonderful uh privilege that uh God has given me to stand before you tonight just to speak a few words that will a few words of encouragement I have not come with something new tonight praise the Lord I have come with that which you already know and just to add on a letter as the spirit of the Lord leads us blessed be the name of the Lord I want to begin with a testimony uh concerning my life ah the uh the biggest miracle that God can do to a man is the Salvation of his soul praise the Lord if not because of Christ I don't know how and where I would be tonight praise the Lord I believe each one of us has got that kind of testimony of how the Lord abandoned the 99 and came looking for you one sheep it is because of the grace of God and I thank God that tonight I can stand boldly in his presence not because I am a strong man but because Christ in me is strong Hallelujah I thank God that we are all standing and I'm also standing because Christ stood at Calvary and that's why I am standing the Bible says he became us that we may become him he took up the nature of sin that you may take up his righteousness Hallelujah Christ went to Calvary on your behalf and that is why there is now no more condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus those who walk not after the will of the flesh Hallelujah I believe we are the children of the spirit led by the Spirit by the grace of God tonight I'm going to talk about Grace the three stages of Grace praise the Lord I'm going to talk about the three stages of Grace now Grace didn't just begin today Grace never begun when you got saved Hallelujah Grace did not start when you heard the word grace started way back even before the world was formed Hallelujah there are three things that God did one God had his four knowledge now sometimes I ask a question have you ever asked yourself that what was there before Genesis 1. have you ever thought that what has been there what was there before Genesis 1 before God said let there be light Let There Be have you ever bothered to think that what was there before God spoke Hallelujah now God had his thoughts he is for our knowledge and in the foreign knowledge of God God saw everything all throughout the seven Church ages blessed be the name of the Lord and I want to tell you according to God's for our knowledge he saw you and that is why you're here because God had seen you back there you never knew you were going to be here tonight but you are here because God had seen you back there in his foreign knowledge and therefore after God had his foreign knowledge he started ordaining things in accordance to his foreign knowledge and that's why God ordained everything there is Hallelujah and according to God's poor knowledge your ordained Grace to be in the place blessed be the name of the Lord because God was not ignorant that there was going to be the fall of Man God in his foreign knowledge so time all throughout the ages until where we are now and everything has to work according to God's foreign knowledge and God's ordination whatever you see taking place now wherever it takes place God saw it before and therefore God had a preparation God had prepared a plan for whatever we see going on now and therefore that's why God cannot fail because God has already prepared a way before there was even one single problem God prepared a way of Escape God prepared healing before there was one disease on Earth God prepared Victory before there was one demon to try you Hallelujah in God's foreign knowledge God knew that you would not thrive in the law and that's why he brought Grace blessed be the name of the Lord you could not attain righteousness through the law so according to God's foreign he had ordained Grace to be and at God's appointed time Grace came at our time Hallelujah because we could only overcome through Grace now I'm going to talk about the three stages of Grace one is justification blessed be the name of the Lord you love the Lord now justification is when God called you let's talk a little about the three things now God the Bible says somewhere that he ordained he chose us in him before the foundation of the world was laid God ordained you a son or daughter before anything was created that means god knew you before anything God had known you and therefore he had ordained you to be a son and the good news is there is nothing the devil can do about it blessed with the name of the Lord if God has ordained you if God ordained you a son or daughter then the devil has been shut out I'll tell you it doesn't matter what the Devil Makes You Do Hallelujah he record change God's program God's plan about your life why because you are a son and a daughter of God I want to just bring a simple example if I am a father and I have a child at home and that child is very rebellious that's the one to do what I tell him when I try to rebuke him tomorrow does the same thing does that mean that that child is not my child Hallelujah now because the tempter is still here with us because we are still in flesh brother sister the devil is going to try to make you do things that are contrary to the word of God but God has had a way of Grace to bring you back to his word and therefore the devil is defeated why because Grace has prevailed blessed be the name of the Lord now the three stages of Grace not everyone can be able to go through them Hallelujah there are a special category of people who are ordained to complete the race there is a special category of people who are going to go through all the three stages but some will not go through all now remember uh uh in the book of Exodus when the children of Israel left Egypt that was their justification God was calling them out of the world of Egypt Hallelujah and it was a very big congregation very many people moved out of Egypt and they walked there when they saw the goodness of the Lord never again the pillar of fire leading them at night and that's how the church is tonight many are called but few are chosen many people today come to Salvation so many so many come as a group by as well you seek Miracles the word of God being Vindicated and everyone is a Christian Hallelujah wait to the time of sanctification when they get to the Wilderness Hallelujah that is where the true seed of God is sin then the Bible tells us not all of them cross the Wilderness because of their unbelief God made them to move rotate in the wilderness praise the Lord God had to sieve his own cartoon and I want to tell you out of the multitude of people who left Egypt [Music] is that amen that does not mean that it is not possible it means that there are people who are going to make it I mean it's trials difficult times that the devil presents to you but I want to tell you tonight there is a people foreign God cannot prepare a heaven in vain that means there is a special category of people who are going to inherit it is [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen there is nothing everybody can do about it there is nothing the devil can do there is even nothing even myself Hallelujah I mean I can't do anything else because I cannot refuse to be because [Music] glory to God we all have parents that day I also have a father if brother longer now comes to me and tells me Brother episode who is your father and then I tell him my father is Mr Joseph and then he tells me you're alive [Music] you are not his son that will not hurt me praise the Lord I won't even get annoyed you know what I will do I will laugh at him because I know he doesn't know what he's talking about he does not know who I am then I need to introduce myself blessed be the name of the Lord and that's how the devil tries to tell us you are not a son you are not a daughter remember yesterday you told a lie yesterday you did this the other day you did this tell the devil you don't know what you're talking about I am a Son of God and I don't even need to struggle to convince you Faith again if you don't believe suit yourself but one thing I know I am a Son of God I Come From Heaven and I'm going back there is no number of demons and nobody the white moon can't do anything about it I want to tell you not even your partner I'm going back home he's in our car and I have to go back home take a joke that's where I come from my heart desires to be there hallelujah amen it may be aggressed house [Music] even if I'm staying in a flat here but I want to be comfortable till I get back to that grandpa's house that is my origin that's where I come from do you know where you come from foreign [Music] [Music] you know what happens [Music] if you desire to stay that means you belong here but if you are desires that means you come from heaven hallelujah hallelujah do you love the Lord God to wonder in the beginning and the Bible tells us that God put his seed in you yeah do you have the seed of God if you have the seed of God then you will rejoice when I say that because you know what I'm talking about Hallelujah God in the beginning and I want to tell you that is foreign [Music] foreign [Music] Uganda sometimes when I walk out there where were you I get scared I don't want to go back there hallelujah hallelujah if you know where you come from you've got the experience of what life is of the three stages of Grace compared it with a glass [Music] you know a glass is a pressure thing it's not it's not like a plastic okay plastic cups can be uh scattered in the kitchen glasses I always kept in a special place they are only pigs when visitors Hallelujah I mean so our glasses are special things so you are a special thing you wear a glass not actually you were you are a glass something very special precious in the eyes [Music] you were thrown in the rubbish something very special but has been abundance then Christ came Christianity also a special thing Hallelujah and then Christ speak to you and that's justification when Christ speak to you that was your justification the Bible says God did not look at the Times that you were still living in sins that is close to that chapter blessed with the name of the Lord do not allow the enemy to haunt you down because of your past life Hallelujah man that chapter has been closed and that's the good news tonight do not be discovered Church the devil can tell you this one also you are rebuking people are drinking alcohol you used to drinking smokers you have said I used to organize and that means I'm overcoming it is the word of God man he Now set it aside and that one became a vessel is [Music] something to be used and that's what God does to a Christian who have the seed of God but they were in church Hallelujah they were in church with the whole congregation now I don't know who was the seed of God is how I can determine whether you have the seed of God in your knots Hallelujah I mean but remember I can give some guidance if you have the seed of God in you then you are receptive when the one of God is being spoken why because it is [Music] that's what God sealed inside of you before now in Ephesians the third step is the baptism of the Holocaust and fire extender [Music] what does quickening mean s giving life something which was dead bringing it back to life now the Bible says and you has he quickened him you love the Lord [Music] now he says that means there was a seed of God inside of you there was something Desiring there was a thirst that you didn't know how to fulfillment that first has been there all the way and you see people are trying to fulfill their thirst okay as a child of God you try to fulfill it when you are still in the world you are trying to quench The Thirst you are trying to quench it by Sleeping with women you were trying to quench that fast you tried it could not work you tried women it could not work you tried drinking it foreign [Music] Hallelujah foreign [Music] Hallelujah so when the gospel was [Music] the seed which was Desiring for the rain started on the ground buried in the ground without the rain for so long but when it the rain fella the seed was weakened and you came back to life you came back to your position you were restored that's what I'm saying we didn't just become sons and daughters [Music] [Music] one of these days you will walk away Hallelujah I mean but if you have been a Son of God [Music] born in that home don't know where else to go and I want to tell you even if you are father just says you know when when people left Christ listen here Jesus said yes [Music] who else has these words of life [Music] we don't have where to go we do not know where else to go because we know we belong to you Hallelujah the Bible says they left us because they were not available [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord so if you type who runs from church to church [Music] you say they hate me from this church I don't know how Pastor is talking about it when it talks about youth who sneak with the girls I know he's trying to talk about me even brother they like quoting even brother brother when God could show him somebody's life [Music] because the word of God doesn't just come to pamper you how to correct if there is anything that needs to be corrected then it is [Music] foreign [Music] it is the seed of God walking in here the word of God molding the divine nature the character of Christ when you believed you believed with a carnal mind what killed it is now the Bible tells us that let this man which was in Christ be in you where do you get that mind of Christ [Music] I'm a Bible College it is the word of God which is in you molding the character of Christ Hallelujah now we should come to church and the more the word of God the more the world Listen gets far away is the word of God is the one molding the characters the character of Christ things will fall down am I talking to someone here there are things that you used to do foreign now yeah when last did I tell a lie you can't even remember it fell away what did that the word of God mourning the character of Christ and it has the power to transform Hallelujah now that is what sanctifies us and God calls you that is your justification now he brings you to church and as you eat the one the world is working the character of Christ Sanctified Hallelujah foreign hallelujah hallelujah don't be worried brother don't worry sister you may not have the Holy Ghost now but I'm here to tell you you are on your way to the promised land salvation is a process it's not something that happens in one day yeah people get the Holocaust in one day three months God deals with us as individuals not as a group Amina foreign hallelujah hallelujah there has to be a power of transformation there has to be something whatever transforms that burns the desire of sin a church you know money you can be in church you believe the word is being preached you say amenities Hallelujah I mean then what should we do korechi you're listening to the word in your heart you know it is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] you will only try for two days now that's why God but they were Christians foreign [Music] did the Judas inherit the Kingdom you died oh he can't of course but Judas went and performed the Miracles and that's why do not be happy convinced When you pray for somebody and that person gets healed the character is what is needed this is [Music] actually deny the Christ without the Holy Ghost praise the Lord the apostles they came to Jesus now tell us who is great among us and that's what happens foreign Hallelujah I mean Peter who was a coward pray today without the Holy Ghost that's why Jesus is looking at these people know and moreover they didn't have the Holy Ghost at that time and they came to Jesus Rejoice [Music] Jesus said do not rejoice because demons but Rejoice because your names book of life and that's all that matters if you don't have the Holy Ghost now if your name is written then God will give you foreign Jesus said me [Music] [Music] things were different you are struggling now but you struggle while on the way to the promises these are not news we are all struggling foreign including myself tofu so when the Holocaust came at the day of Pentacles they came out remember on the streets now to face persecution that's why I'm saying you can't face persecution without the holy ghosts am I speaking to human beings we've got to go through all the three stages don't don't accept to stop in the wilderness [Music] [Music] and our Promised Land blessed be the name of the Lord who was saying he was saying two laws are struggling within him when he wants to do Christ truth is when that's wrong Hallelujah he even said I think in the Book of Romans what do you think the Lord Thrice yeah I besought the Lord Thrice [Music] that it may depart from me brother sister you know what Jesus what God told him he said my grace is sufficient brother sister the grace of God is sufficient for you blessed be the name of the Lord if the grace of God is sufficient for you then you would say Amen to that oh [Music] that is not the end of the road again though foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] it doesn't matter how slow it may be so much before the Rapture takes place amazing why because God had you in history before God said later [Music] and God had prepared cartoon where on how you are going to overcome you didn't just appear here by mistake you didn't just happen on Earth there was somebody who planned for you before so God has prepared your life all the programming of your life and you've got to do everything according to that because there is nothing you can do to change it that's why the Bible says it is not what we we we became foreign you see the random says maybe I should chip this as a conclude now this is the greatest gift that God has ever sent to the world is Jesus Christ the greatest gift that God sent to the Bible says in the Book of John chapter 1 verse 1 says in the beginning was the word and the Word was God put on flesh and dwelt among us [Music] because Bible students know that was Jesus Christ now the greatest gift that God has ever sent to the world okay is Christo you know the word of God when you receive it what it comes with your salvation it comes with your Victory it comes with your healing God's word has everything I don't care what you want now the word of God is able to provide because Jesus was a full package with everything that's what the Bible says in marketing that this sign shall follow them that believe me again [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord in my name now whatever you want put it in Mark 16. as long as you believe then you have everything now I say the full package for example foreign [Music] Coco if you break that egg you are going to find a liquidity Hallelujah but inside that liquid their legs for chicken you'll find feathers intestines and that's why that's how the word of God is Amina blessed in our Lord whatever you want your natural is in the word of God it is here you may not see it that doesn't mean that's not there Hallelujah your Victory he's in this seat is [Music] foreign but when it is planted in your heart will not see the files fertile ground in your heart then it is going to germinate again and then you see everything that you wanted it is now seen why because he has found fertile ground foreign are we there if you abide in me and my word abides you shall ask for anything he didn't say he shall ask for simple things you shall ask for something again he says whatsoever you shall you desire When you pray believe it is I don't have anything that can help you the battles that you're fighting in Paris or one I am of no help to you why watch because personal I'm also fighting you are fighting I'm also fighters [Music] God has given us the weapon cartoon if you can shoot the enemy one of these days you're going to die aim you've got to aim and shoot for yourself [Music] so God is very just he gave all of us weapons so if you keep yours in the closet one of these days you're going to perish but if you are going to use that weapons because I tell you church we are fighting every day in this world as long as you're still putting on Flesh and Blood there's no way you can you are no serious he's not there your battles rages from out and tell us even up to church is that amen there is someone called the greatest battle ever fought [Music] as the people are seated here now um the war is in your head right now so how do you fight that God has given us the weapon and that is why your Victory lies may the Lord father we thank you foreign [Music] [Music] not the enemy devil Stan will not take it away from us granted father to a touch Lord Jesus I want to pray for the leadership of this church Lord Jesus continue to keep him protect him and provide for him Grant him more revelation of this message I pray for the Believers entire congregation still struggling with unbelief and yet they desire to work with you Lord Jesus give them the ability to live for you [Music] here Lord you are here [Music] set them free now [Music] [Music] lead yourself I'm coming please [Music] [Music] the glory of your name of Jesus may the Lord bless you as the pastor comes what a friend we have [Music] good amen and we can you play that song you were playing you know I this song was just coming to me as the brother was ministering and I I wasn't quite making out what it is and then I had the brother playing and I was like oh yeah that's the song It Is Well with My Soul and brother Edison that's because I have a friend in Jesus thank you for the word it was very time [Music] [Music] this again so as we just sing a few songs and as we are going to prayer now as we just divide the presence of God under the presence of the conviction that we have received by the preaching of the word the desire that the Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] my way [Music] when Sorrows like sea [Music] wow [Music] thou has done me to say it is [Music] foreign [Music] should come [Music] let these places [Music] [Music] it is [Music] myself [Music] foreign [Music] all myself [Music] please [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is where we [Music] it is [Music] sing the song I'd rather be an all-time Christian I'd rather be an all-time Christian amen just very good North today as well in this world I've tried most everything and I'm happy now to say there is nothing like religion in the good old-fashioned way I am working in the all-time way I want the world to know that I'll try to be an old-time Christian than anything I know [Music] [Applause] [Music] everything I know [Music] mysterious places [Music] [Music] I know it's nothing like an all-time question with a question [Music] everywhere I go [Music] it is [Music] old times [Music] there is [Music] amen there's nothing like being an all-time Christian can you say Amen to that hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen shall we sing that I don't know whether we can sing that let's try it see if you can sing that have you been beneath the fountain have you been beneath the fountain but if you can find those words for us to sing that song yes foreign before but overnight is a very good time to learn a few songs but these songs is about what about has been ministering about I believe who can begin to the chorus have you been beneath the fountain there's no I by the place to go flowing down from calvary's Mountain it will work too wide as snow the chorus one more time [Music] there is
