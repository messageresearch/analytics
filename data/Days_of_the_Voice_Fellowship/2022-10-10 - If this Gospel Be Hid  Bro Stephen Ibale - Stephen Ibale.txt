TRANSCRIPT
========================================
oh Jesus is keeping me alive [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen God praise the name of the Lord hey man I just want to greet you only the precious name of our Lord Jesus today we are privileged to have visitors visiting us today we are privileged to have the Lord coming our way amen Amina uh Pastor Stephen um one of the Elders of the message in our country he will tell us but I think his ministry could span over for about 40 yards [Music] and so there are many other preachers that you know have come up over the years and uh joined the throng of those who have started and you know and the message has been preached so I always say there are those the first generation preachers of the message the second generation the fact I don't know which generation I am maybe the seventh I don't know but in Uganda Uganda Pastor Stephen is in the first generation uh he's here with his wife sister Sarah yeah and uh they have had also a marriage of many years they will tell us [Music] my wife and I uh always uh I don't I don't know the right word to use but uh I should say we always convey to have such a marriage that has been time tested and we appreciate you brother Steven and Sister Sarah for being an example to very many in our generation and um so I have had an opportunity to work closely with brother Stephen for a few years he invited me to minister also in his church a few years ago before I even became a pastor yeah before we even traveled to Ethiopia and I was very small body but he trusted me with his poop I hope I did not cause any damage but I want to say God bless you for that opportunity and uh so today you know when I invited him to come he was very gracious and he accepted the invitations um our charge is just well about uh a year and a half can you say your face although we have a few that have come from other churches and so we have a few here who have also been in the message for quite some time and uh I know our students are all not here there are also some would stream with us and since we usually archive our services I believe that there will be many more who will hear the service today we are requesting you Pastor Steven to preach to us there is I believe much more in you [Music] that we here in this Fellowship [Music] is that right and um just have a hundred percent Liberty you are our father you know it's always a good uh to know you know our support say that you do not have many fathers those who went and established the message when I I've been I've had that opportunity in Ethiopia when there is completely no message it is very hard to start from nothing and so you should always respect affect Those Who start who do the rudimentary work the same way there is always much in them that we can learn by Ministry Pastor Stephen is a teacher and so I believe we have a lot to learn today I would like you to also give a hundred percent attention we have one service so we want to give him as much time as he needs service we are not in a hurry [Music] and so then I would know that you are doing that by saying Amen to everyone amen so without uh father you would like us to stand and then we sing A Chorus as we invite him Ethiopia and uh since I would not like uh the pastor's time to be taken when he comes I don't know he says no but come and greet us just one minute let us hear yourself I traveled with him even to take right where there is a war now and uh and uh he was a good brother for one year or two foreign supposedly it's not easy or is to start from nothing it takes a man with the courage so I know you are all in good hands I've worked with him I know him I've worked with him God bless you so much so um we started in our house which is just right here at about three five people my family [Music] from there we rented another place out there but rather Monument so it became full the Lord now gave us this place so we want to say uh Pastor Steven thank you for coming to support us let us stand and sing in moments like this I sing out a song [Music] I sing out a song I sing out a love song to Jesus [Music] in moments like this I sing God I got a song I sing God I love songs or lift up your hands and sing I love you sing in God I love you Lord [Music] singing eyes [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but as long as we are in this Divine crisis that you are going to guide them you are going to guide the game father that we may touch heavenly father I want you to disarm our minds that we may not understand by our mind I wondered that we may understand by the heart father dear Lord God dwelling upon the past the blessing upon his family all the entire ministers amen you see when he was speaking he spoke about being the seventh uh I mean the seventh generation of Ministries and when he speaks about the Seventh Generation then I remember the words [Music] I feel like [Music] foreign foreign [Music] you know I'm very impressed when you're coming down here I find that the preachers uh uh you know position when the preacher's position on the stage is on the left that's what I do at home you see when those angels came there was that main Angel he was standing at a position was at his right side so you know I feel like nobody should stand between me and the angels praise the Lord I want to stand at his right hand right hand over Authority is disorganized places because I don't feel comfortable with the other side [Music] is the brightest side isn't that right yes it's the bright side so I love it amen amen [Music] amen I mean I've traveled with my wife yeah has you know come a long way with me is 42 years but she foreign it's uh it's just my wife oh yeah my channel amen I mean those hands have levered for the Saints she has spoken almost for everybody from across the world everybody I've also traveled with William in Tampa dinette William William is one of my four Sons William when you get good girls [Music] the good boys so that's brother Williams is a very great blessing to us amen I mean he's in the medical field [Music] amen so his uh an instructor in the Medical Institution uh amen me that is a blessing to our family so before we get on here we want to once again appreciate Brothers for giving us the opportunity when I listen to him when moon is a um there's almost nothing that you people would need more than him they were more it is I promise I'm not going to say anything is the ability to say or what he has already said so I'm just coming to share with him in the final year and I pray the Lord blesses us amen [Music] here I says but have renounced the hidden things of dishonest not walking in a craftiness nor handling the word of God deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commanding ourselves to Every Man's conscience in the sight of God is [Music] my God a blessing the reading of this world now this verse us to renounce the kind of things twiggan that we may be involved we can even without the world not um things of dishonest [Music] let's go to verse 3 here it is heed to them that are lost in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine unto themes so when we denounce the hidden fee between there is a light that glows out to the world because your Christ's life is the light to the world so verse 5 here for we preach not ourselves we are not the film of the Gospel We Don't Preach ourselves into your souls we preach not ourselves that Pastor Steve is greater than brother so and so much all I can preach better all I've got a better congregation We Don't Preach ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord when will that Christian yes and ourselves your servants for Jesus sakes for God you commanded the light to shine out of Darkness foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] but we have this light vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us amen did you hear that sometimes you may not know what you have but the light that brought life in the darkest small world now Paul says that has taken a failure of men that have been Justified amen through you your sauce so The Treasure of this slide you do not know who you are but if you know who the words hallelujah amen you can bring life around this singing in Genesis is [Music] [Music] [Music] is not speaking about the spoken word books he's not talking about types and bibles for is speaking about to return the pieces Hallelujah Amina praise the Lord not talking about your Bible it's not talking about the fates you listen he's talking about you uh you'll get a quick way in that gospel if this gospel God give me Grace [Music] each time the gospel is we should always go back Hallelujah [Music] [Music] he was no not the creation you are the one who speaks so sad life was a being hey praise God he was not visible even to the spirit he did not resource capacitor black sisters [Music] because there was nobody seeking to know him I imagine he was self-existence and literally Locust means the spirit Logo Street against amen I mean are you together with me so in other words he took what will refer to as the world body is because he's condescending is coming from that Spirit invisibility to a spirit visibility and the spirit visibility was what we call the world that is [Music] he used to live in the same Dimension with God because he did not have a body of Flesh the spirit of inspiration with the Holy Spirit leads to deliver today and you're together with me yes sir I mean but when it came to town hallelujah amen then God said I'm going to make this man here bring him into dimension of Flesh praise God so now man come down from the Angels amen and God was in that Supreme dimensions [Applause] he falls nagua where it fell come on God now came from the Supreme Dimensions to come into the physical dimensions [Music] foreign [Music] when he becomes in flesh he became a brother yeah [Music] when Paul is speaking about him he's saying that he had become lower so now how can we see the pathways praise God and become like one of us well it's so good man brother Branham says but notes now there is nothing there's nothing okay what is Justice there is no light okay where did you tangle there is no duck is that there's no nothing it just seems is a great Supernatural beasts of all places he was from Everlasting amen he is [Music] [Music] Hallelujah when we get to paragraph 28. he said the next thing we begin to see eyes of Supernatural looking we see a little white light forming out there that was caught by Viper readers [Music] I was going to say to devop into something yeah so human beings [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] not to defeat yeah the feet it was not given to the mouse so that the gospel I wondering may be your work Engineers is the best gospel you can ever pray amen he says that was the word of God listen to what it says now God tell him to this song which was before there was even no atom oh yeah yeah glorify me further with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world hallelujah hallelujah foreign was just a different manifestation see the sun Oman is the condescending of Elohim yes and when God formed himself into what the body we finally got into the womb of the Virgin Islands and the son was born Hallelujah [Music] [Music] [Music] I'm the world the same was in the beginning with God now listen all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made he condescended into the sonship yes so in Colossians 1 16 we shall go through quite a number of scriptures to make this plant here I believe in quotes Colossians 1 16. when all things created in heaven I sensed something wrong there for by him when all things created bye foreign you understand what I mean we all things created I'm a believer of the Kingdom's Bible [Music] oh we're all things created [Music] all things were created by Him and foreign just changes foreign [Music] all I understand gambo [Music] amen Amina first John chapter one and verse 1. he said that which was from the beginning come on now did you hear that but which was in the beginning in the beginning was the word which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes becomes [Music] hahaha praise God what can I hear that to me yes sir we will amen what the life was manifested Witnesses [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] a perfect [Music] amen I mean it has to be that place it is [Music] is the expression of his life away praise the Lord I was speaking in one of my meetings out there and I was speaking about the Sun you see many times when the sun is mentioned it you just go to the understanding of the natural path foreign he says you're not here father sir absolutely that kind of understanding it up with you but yay in scripture is when the Holy Spirit take English then that is when the Holy Spirit come down on the Jordan River for the first time Jesus yes who was introduced as the son yeah praise the Lord praise God that's what the sun is Jesus was not son yes because he was born of a woman so in that particular aspect what would make me a song you see where I'm coming foreign [Music] received him self [Music] [Music] [Music] amen are you that's what makes you a son are you here sons of God Amen Amina yes sir we wow so we are not dealing with men we are not dealing with the man he took it up and we are dealing with the spirit of Life himself don't lose that Concepts foreign what is calling the gospel the words we speak while we preached up by the life so the gospel is more of a work the Walk of the holy spirit is more of that is it are you together with me walk me a gospel if this gospel it's a lived life is the discipline of the Christ's life the lights [Music] and once that life is on the inside John 1 4 you can is yeah the Christ's life in the Jesus body Christ amen was the light of men and the same life in the bright body in the bright body becomes the light of men too [Music] of the creative life of Genesis [Music] who created the heavens and yes God but it was voided but God created it who called you why you voice foreign but you are the work of God in continuation praise the Lord he created the world going around [Music] going around one day foreign I understand your desire to serve God and yet I understand the contradictions when you want to do good foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Cola amen brother Branham says that much of him is God cartoon amen just a little light that comes in I catch up to make you quit doing wrong now if you can take all the malice at the sing away and [Music] everywhere that little life [Music] of light and power of God will keep going baby [Music] it doesn't work particular are you obeying the laws of the church what words lesson overpowers hallelujah hallelujah the prophet says and you don't do it by exhortation of God's exercise foreign [Music] and as you receive the words and then it produces the supernatural life the life that steps forward foreign [Music] in red with the light that is foreign [Music] I want to tell you something they are nice fruits but they come from a seat which takes a little longer to come from I think here this is do you know what empath is you put it in the ground when you get that seed and put it in the ground what's it brother okay let's go you get that seed you put it there it will even take care it will take a full year but wants it to pass you don't need to give up the way because certain areas of your life which are not protective just keep under that life [Music] hallelujah praise God amen on the side of a Believer there is a hidden beauty of Holiness is certainly waiting for that believer to open up to that Divine Life you will begin to ascend into the Heavenly place in Christ Jesus Christ amen I mean you come to a position where you will say let them see the lights all the darkness of sin foreign and it just come and stayed unto her I'm the light and once that broadcast Revelation that was the end of it are you together with me now not that she was not in the Lamb's Book of Lies but she was not in the channel one day I came up to the son of Life they didn't know who she was but Jesus they always talk about stories oh this is her wickedness yes [Music] [Music] you can foreign meaning that the person himself once you believe him the Lord Jesus Christ you don't walk under the lies he becomes a companion are you together he becomes the Lord the one who baptized yet after the same time [Music] he wants to send to the world foreign [Music] foreign in the valley well that much trouble on your community at the light of the world it almost is he at the light of the world did you hear that he said I am the light of the world but because he is our light the light of life foreign [Music] [Music] Hallelujah [Music] [Music] what you do not know is that you just don't understand how to position your life what you would be some way of watching us while you're here yes [Music] let your light so shine before men around that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven foreign [Music] you cannot be my chapter foreign [Music] [Music] God doesn't deal with duplicates God doesn't deal with photocopies are you together with a pretty thing now everyone of us in the form of Ray of life you are a written episode amen I mean if the gospel is here it's because what we know is not translating into what we are too many what we are is not what we have believed okay second Corinthians are you here with me sometimes he said when I go to my missions they are hungry Souls there what are your name is and my wife says you are going to kill yourself I preached three and a half four hours foreign we thank God for his grace you'll become a very great money because the light is just a matter of removing the bushels [Music] so that's the flame can become brighter that's all we need the reason why you're here is you already have that little button that little button of light it keeps growing foreign [Music] but have renounced the hidden things not walking in the crafting us not handling the word of God [Music] of the truth commanding ourselves [Music] that's your life must be so short it must be surprised that it appeals the conscience of men what is heat away see all your watch out he wants you so that you can appeal foreign [Music] the attitude changes the Fashion World changes [Music] there is a level of sincerity it always seems that's the gospel now second Corinthians 4 3. he says not yet if our gospel is the engineers it is lead to them that are lost but your light is too bright um [Music] that it cannot be hit and the boys [Music] are you together Paul has described the power of that life and we have also seen in different areas the power of that is if it is she's wondering it's thousands of 40 meters he says how can you help that life meaning that you put the Power of influence you are the power of influence are you together with me you leave your life to cut the next election he says if this gospel peace to them that are lost in whom the God of this world Marvel the Thunder When sin has blinded the minds of them which believe not is unless the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ which is your life [Music] hahaha the Glorious life is your life amen I mean which is the image you see it's very important foreign [Music] that you cause the people to think curated what's in that church what's in that can say yo you become so bright oh yeah the world Knew You Went Away now you are totally somebody different you are so proud that's the best gospel singer that is with this light on the inside of ourselves it transforms us and that's what we call the New Paths see where I'm coming from amen I mean you become a new creature and the new man in Christ become two different people leave this gospel be here and then give it away is because we've not thrown off doctor the two never quite the opportunity to be sick together with me yeah let's just says some more about life you see when we read the light but this is completely diminish it to this life your eyes but you can be in darkness in the midst of this Natural Life I'm talking about her life I'm talking about Elohim Elohim who created himself into light which is called logos came into body of men and then released that same life because the life is in the blood because that's where I'm coming from he came in the upper room hallelujah hallelujah praise God be the body of Christ which was that Supernatural life so you

not just realizing everything that I've seen too much I need the remedy together foreign foreign they repent then yeah they get baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and when they received the Holy ghosts you know it's very important being baptized into Christo which made it so simple that anybody can be baptized it is true it is [Music] [Music] those are the ones that were in him before the foundation again amen I mean enter into that channel and be baptized of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins of eternal life are you looking at the pathway amen I mean it means that there is a sincerity and now when the Bible says in the name it is not so simplified that's the right formula according to food is the Lord Jesus Christ Christian [Music] amen praise the Lord no
