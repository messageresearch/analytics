[20:28] that I received that

[53:28] Amharic they are foreigners they are
[53:30] ugandans so they speak English and need

[53:41] [Music]
[53:45] me God has taught me English so I am in

[54:19] Christ uh we love you so much the whole
[54:23] church in Ethiopia loves you
[54:25] uh thinking that there is bride in
[54:27] Uganda it's just we are one big family
[54:31] one big body of Christ and we're are one
[54:33] and the same we're like brothers uh we
[54:36] don't feel strange when when we are here
[54:39] in Fellowship we're like one big family
[54:42] and we are are I see my sisters I see
[54:45] them my as my sisters and brothers
[54:47] they're like we're uh we are bloodly
[54:50] related with Christ Jesus uh so we love
[54:54] you all and uh I just want to give
[54:57] testimony saying um what what the
[55:00] message means to me uh at the beginning
[55:03] when I received the message I used I
[55:06] don't have many Kno how what the message
[55:09] is when people speaks about the seal the
[55:13] seven Church age all the things are like
[55:16] a mystery for me at the beginning but
[55:18] yet uh there's something a truth because
[55:21] when I just heard one word from the
[55:24] message something in me if you are a
[55:26] seed of God when you heard the truth a
[55:29] light will spark in your heart you it's
[55:32] like you heard your name is being
[55:34] calling and you'll jump Ah that's my
[55:36] name calling that is like when you catch
[55:38] the Revelation so it's in the beginning
[55:41] you might not see like you might not
[55:44] understand many big things like seals
[55:46] every Hidden Mysteries the 17 weeks of
[55:49] Daniels but when you like a seed when a
[55:52] seed is
[55:54] planted
[55:56] when a seed when a seed is planted when
[55:58] it's soed first it dies and then when
[56:01] you water it and the sun strikes it it
[56:04] will start to sprung out so uh it needs
[56:07] sunlight and also water for us we need
[56:10] to some to need we need to have some
[56:12] efforts for that seed to grow the seed
[56:15] of God in us to grow we need some
[56:17] efforts of ourselves we need to uh feed
[56:21] for the from the word of God from the
[56:23] message we need to look we need to
[56:26] search for God who he He Is We need to
[56:30] look for him we need to seek Him
[56:32] diligently we need to really know we
[56:35] need
[56:36] to we need to need him we need to seek
[56:40] him we need to look for him so he can
[56:43] reveal to us himself if you don't knock
[56:46] very well the door might not be open if
[56:48] you knock slightly like this no one will
[56:51] care who is this at the door or they
[56:53] will not think that there is someone
[56:55] urgent waiting for us but if you really
[56:57] know very well ah what's wrong let's see
[57:01] and we someone will open for us so we
[57:04] can knock at the gates of Kingdom of
[57:07] Heaven very well so God can open for us
[57:11] and reveal himself for us and I want to
[57:14] encourage sisters and brothers to know
[57:16] very well to seek God diligently so he
[57:19] can open for you and give you your
[57:22] desires of your heart and um for the for
[57:27] message for me is like it's my life I
[57:30] get to see who I am the purpose of God I
[57:33] get to see where I was how uh who I am
[57:38] and where I where my destiny is I'm not
[57:41] like a blind person I I'm not a person
[57:43] that doesn't know where he's going I
[57:46] know I know my destination I know I was
[57:49] in the mind of God before the foundation
[57:52] of the L the world I know what pred
[57:54] destination means everything has been
[57:57] revealed for me when the message came
[57:59] into my life and I praise the Lord for
[58:03] bringing the truth in my way because I I
[58:05] didn't go finding for the truth he the
[58:08] truth find me and I'm I'm I am so happy
[58:12] for the Lord God bless you H the church
[58:15] in Ethiopia greets you loves you may
[58:17] anyone who wants to visit to Ethiopia
[58:20] come to visit to Ethiopia we are most
[58:23] welcome to receive you God bless you
[58:26] just a
[58:28] moment uh there is something I want to
[58:35] say
[58:37] here uh brother
[58:41] DT uh there is a testimony that he gave
[58:46] when brother DT came to the message um I
[58:49] think it was brother giray who
[58:51] introduced you to to to us and then we
[58:53] shared with him the message Brother D
[58:56] did not have a Shadow of Doubt he he
[58:59] believed it immediately and he was
[59:01] baptized and after that brother dwit
[59:04] like he said he was driving long long
[59:06] Journeys but one day brother
[59:10] dwit uh something came to him he said
[59:13] what am I dying for you people you are
[59:15] coming here we were in the in the how is
[59:18] it called underground basement yes when
[59:21] the basement uh just like this is a
[59:23] basement I don't know what is about with
[59:25] basements with me so the church was in a
[59:28] basement and uh you know I believe that
[59:31] was the so seed sewing time and so
[59:34] brother DT felt that he was missing out
[59:37] when all the others including his wife
[59:39] at that time she was not married to him
[59:41] you know you know they were very busy
[59:43] fisting on the word and for him he was
[59:45] very busy driving going to jibou going
[59:46] to Sudan going to whever he even during
[59:50] that time he told me give me tracks I
[59:52] want to go and distribute I want to tell
[59:54] the people people about this message but
[59:56] still he was having hunger to come and
[59:59] sit in the in the church so he decided
[1:00:02] actually made a decision I was shocked
[1:00:04] he decided I'm no longer going to go
[1:00:06] back to that job I'm going to sit in the
[1:00:08] church I'm not going to miss Services H
[1:00:11] if God doesn't bless me that's up to him
[1:00:12] but for me I'm going to be in the church
[1:00:15] and when he made that decision he said
[1:00:17] one full year nothing
[1:00:19] happened but there is another brother I
[1:00:21] don't know whether you know him brother
[1:00:22] lisen you remember brother lis listen he
[1:00:25] was one of the first but I think he was
[1:00:28] not he did not stick around very much
[1:00:30] listen had come from another place in
[1:00:33] jibou I think he was working in jibuti
[1:00:35] as a driver so when he came to Adis he
[1:00:37] stayed around said Brothers Pastor can
[1:00:39] you help me find a job we said we cannot
[1:00:41] so he decided to leave the church and he
[1:00:44] went to do some other things uh not in
[1:00:46] the church but he was a very good driver
[1:00:48] so now when God came down God brought a
[1:00:52] sister she said I want a brother who is
[1:00:56] a very good driver we want to give him
[1:00:59] the job in the embassy and uh the only
[1:01:03] person that could come in my mind was
[1:01:04] brother dwit but brother DT did not know
[1:01:06] how to speak English so he did not have
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] requirements but you see it's not about
[1:01:12] the requirements that man knows it's
[1:01:14] about the requirements of God and and
[1:01:17] and brother D without the requirements
[1:01:19] of man God gave him that job amen many
[1:01:25] applicants had applied but all of them
[1:01:28] did not go through but the one that
[1:01:30] decided to serve God went through and
[1:01:33] when I go to Ethiopia these days I don't
[1:01:35] go like a commoner at the airport I'm
[1:01:37] taking a very huge car with a with a CD
[1:01:41] number plate and I'm taken all the way
[1:01:43] through by a man who is respected by the
[1:01:46] authorities and we are so glad for
[1:01:48] Brother D it praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:51] and uh sister faven um some of you and
[1:01:54] I'm saying this really to encourage our
[1:01:55] people here sister faven when um when
[1:01:59] sister y I think she was the first to
[1:02:01] come in the message and sister yodit how
[1:02:03] many know sister
[1:02:04] yodit a few here know sister yodit so
[1:02:07] this one is a sister to sister yodit a
[1:02:09] cousin sister to sister yodit so sister
[1:02:11] yodit brought her she said this sister
[1:02:14] will believe she will believe oh she
[1:02:15] loves God she will believe I love sister
[1:02:17] yodit is enthusiasm and so when we sat
[1:02:20] down with sister Fen she heard the
[1:02:23] message and she had and asked questions
[1:02:25] and you can see she she loves God with
[1:02:27] you can hear you and you can see that by
[1:02:29] what she was speaking here and she asked
[1:02:32] many questions but when all her
[1:02:33] questions were answered she said I
[1:02:35] believed I need to be baptized right
[1:02:37] away and from the time she was baptized
[1:02:40] listen her mother was not a believer of
[1:02:42] the message and her mother was not even
[1:02:44] accepting her to go and believe the
[1:02:45] message but two things I want to say
[1:02:47] about sister f which will bless some of
[1:02:49] you sisters two things number one sister
[1:02:51] Fe was at University but during the
[1:02:54] whole time when she was at University
[1:02:56] she never
[1:02:58] back sisters who at University are you
[1:03:00] hearing sister f Never Back le she in
[1:03:04] and it was very far away from home
[1:03:06] deborra Tabo I think it
[1:03:09] was 600 km from
[1:03:12] home like from here in Nairobi but she
[1:03:16] never back as
[1:03:17] sleep sisters who at University are you
[1:03:19] hearing this testimony say Amen she
[1:03:22] never back asleep but she instead
[1:03:24] invited us she would call me each time
[1:03:26] Pastor what about this this question
[1:03:27] I've been sharing with my friends this
[1:03:29] if you at univers and you're not sharing
[1:03:31] with your friends there's a problem with
[1:03:32] your faith and and finally she invited
[1:03:35] us we went there we traveled there I
[1:03:37] remember I traveled there with pastor
[1:03:38] morgus at the time and um and we
[1:03:40] encouraged her we traveled 600 kilomet
[1:03:43] just to encourage her and we traveled
[1:03:45] back again to Adis Saab number one
[1:03:48] number two but it was because of her
[1:03:49] Zeal that you know ministers or
[1:03:52] preachers are there God has placed them
[1:03:54] there but but your Zeal will make them
[1:03:56] will make God use them to benefit you
[1:03:59] but if you don't have Zeal like she was
[1:04:01] saying if you don't know seriously God
[1:04:03] will not use the preachers to bless your
[1:04:05] life so that's the first testimony I
[1:04:07] wanted to speak about the second one her
[1:04:10] mother I don't know whether you want
[1:04:11] this say but her mother went to the

[1:16:25] of Exodus chapter

[1:16:32] 5 praise the
[1:16:42] Lord when you have reached in Exodus 5
[1:16:45] please say Amen if you reach
[1:16:50] there okay I can see a few have reached
[1:16:52] there
[1:16:55] brother Shem you are going to have to
[1:16:57] rectify my sound because I cannot hear
[1:17:05] myself uh chapter 5:
[1:17:15] 6 now I'm going to read only in
[1:17:18] English and then you who are reading
[1:17:21] luganda you just follow along
[1:17:25] um it's we're going to read up to verses
[1:17:27] 21 I think that's much better
[1:17:32] now okay so reading verses from vers
[1:17:38] six and Pharaoh commanded the same day
[1:17:41] the task masters of the people and their
[1:17:44] officers saying ye shall no more give
[1:17:48] the people straw to make brick and here
[1:17:50] too for let them go and gather straw for
[1:17:54] themselves so I'm going to read from
[1:17:55] vers up to vers 21 so you just follow me
[1:17:57] closely and the tail of the bricks which
[1:18:00] they did make here to for ye shall lay
[1:18:04] upon them ye shall not diminish o
[1:18:07] thereof for they be Idol therefore they
[1:18:10] cry saying let us go and sacrifice to
[1:18:13] our God let there be let there more work
[1:18:17] be laid upon the men that they may labor
[1:18:20] therein and let them not regard vain
[1:18:22] work
[1:18:23] words and the task masters of the people
[1:18:26] went out and their officers and they
[1:18:28] spake to the people saying thus sayth
[1:18:31] Pharaoh I will not give you straw go ye
[1:18:35] get you straw where ye can find it yet
[1:18:39] not out of your work shall be diminished
[1:18:42] so the people were scattered abroad
[1:18:45] throughout all the land of Egypt to
[1:18:48] gather stubble instead of straw and the
[1:18:51] taskmasters hasted them
[1:18:53] saying fulfill your Works your daily
[1:18:56] tasks as when there was
[1:18:59] straw and the officers of the children
[1:19:02] of Israel which Pharaoh's task Masters
[1:19:06] had set over them were
[1:19:09] beaten and demanded where far have ye
[1:19:13] not fulfilled your task in the in making
[1:19:16] brick both yesterday and today as here
[1:19:19] to
[1:19:21] four then the officer of the children of
[1:19:23] Israel came and Cried unto Pharaoh
[1:19:26] saying wherefore dealest thou thus with
[1:19:29] thy
[1:19:30] servants there is no straw given unto
[1:19:33] thy servants and they said to us make
[1:19:36] brick and behold thy servants are beaten
[1:19:39] but the fault is in thine own people but
[1:19:43] he said ye are Idol ye are Idol there
[1:19:48] you say let us go and do sacrifice to
[1:19:49] the Lord go there now and work
[1:19:53] for there shall no stroke be given you
[1:19:56] yet shall ye deliver the tail of bricks
[1:19:59] and the officers of the children of
[1:20:00] Israel did see that they were in evil
[1:20:04] case after it was said ye shall not
[1:20:07] Minish out from your bricks of your
[1:20:10] daily task and they met Moses Aaron who
[1:20:15] stood in the way as they came from
[1:20:17] Pharaoh forth from pharaoh and they said
[1:20:20] unto them the Lord look upon you you and
[1:20:23] judge you because you have made our
[1:20:26] server to be abhold in the eyes of
[1:20:29] pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants
[1:20:32] to put a sword in in their hand to slay
[1:20:36] us I read up to 23 and Moses returned
[1:20:39] unto the Lord and said Lord wherefore
[1:20:42] hast thou go thou so evil inre these
[1:20:46] people why is it that thou Hast sent me
[1:20:49] for since I came to pharaoh to speak in
[1:20:51] thy name he has done evil to these
[1:20:54] people neither hast thou delivered thy
[1:20:56] people at
[1:20:58] all let us speak to the Lord for just a

[1:24:54] it because every year we have heard
[1:24:59] it and it will become bigger and bigger
[1:25:01] I
[1:25:02] believe it's good for us to have
[1:25:04] Fellowship
[1:25:06] together isn't it
[1:25:09] friends and so Sister Rose donated a
[1:25:13] [Music]
[1:25:15] goat and we are going to have
[1:25:19] that
[1:25:20] uh we may not do as we have been doing
[1:25:25] before but we shall we shall have it
[1:25:30] anyway and so you just come with
[1:25:32] whatever we shall
[1:25:34] have at 7 p.m. and then uh we will have
[1:25:39] up to 8:00
[1:25:41] p.m. and then at 9:00 p.m. we can now
[1:25:45] come in the church and have our
[1:25:47] crossover
[1:25:48] service come with your
[1:25:51] needs POS write them
[1:25:54] down things that you want God to do for
[1:25:56] you this
[1:25:57] coming we are people of
[1:25:59] faith and that will be a little action
[1:26:02] of faith that you will
[1:26:04] take and so uh just come
[1:26:07] expecting for what the Lord will
[1:26:10] do but in this service it's our end of
[1:26:13] your
[1:26:14] service but in my mind I have crossing
[1:26:20] over amen crossing
[1:26:23] over you know God has ordained
[1:26:27] times and Seasons it is all in his
[1:26:32] hands he knows what will happen and
[1:26:36] when nothing can take God by
[1:26:40] surprise everything God sees that is
[1:26:44] happening in your
[1:26:46] life it is happening by
[1:26:51] Design even
[1:26:53] sadness even
[1:26:55] Joy even when you're so
[1:26:58] happy even when you are so down it's all
[1:27:01] in the plan of
[1:27:03] God and so there are phases in our
[1:27:06] life that God takes us
[1:27:09] to and you know God does not give you
[1:27:13] everything at a
[1:27:16] goal did you know that because if God
[1:27:19] was to give you everything at a go
[1:27:23] then you would not trust
[1:27:26] him but God wants us to be in a
[1:27:29] place where we can always rely on
[1:27:34] him God wants us not to depend on our
[1:27:37] own
[1:27:39] selves but God wants us to depend on
[1:27:42] him that is why when when you ask things
[1:27:46] from
[1:27:47] him to some he will
[1:27:50] give to others he will not
[1:27:53] why because he is a designer of the
[1:27:58] heart God knows the status of your
[1:28:02] heart God knows if he gives you
[1:28:05] money to some of you you will abandon
[1:28:09] him you will not trust him again so you
[1:28:12] will pray for a full
[1:28:15] year God give me
[1:28:17] money and God will not give you
[1:28:20] money because he knows if he doesn't
[1:28:23] give you money you will trust
[1:28:26] him you will trust him you will depend
[1:28:29] on him you will keep coming to church
[1:28:33] you will be
[1:28:34] faithful so he will not give you
[1:28:38] something which will take you out of his
[1:28:43] presence you know one of them say
[1:28:46] Lord I think it was
[1:28:48] David he said give me enough that I
[1:28:52] don't
[1:28:53] beg but don't give me a
[1:28:56] lot that I leave your presence I believe
[1:29:00] that's where God wants us to
[1:29:02] be to some of you you will ask for
[1:29:05] something and you want it so
[1:29:08] bad but I tell you what if God knows the
[1:29:12] status of your heart is
[1:29:15] right if he knows it is
[1:29:18] right he will give you what you desire
[1:29:22] and I said everything you
[1:29:25] desire and this evening I'm saying God

[1:30:27] phase God brought you the
[1:30:30] message the second phase you know God
[1:30:34] had to work on your
[1:30:36] heart amen for you to make the right
[1:30:40] decision to leave the job that was
[1:30:42] taking you away from his
[1:30:45] presence and you came in his
[1:30:47] presence with
[1:30:50] nothing that was a
[1:30:53] that God brought you
[1:30:54] to but then that was not the
[1:30:58] end God was still
[1:31:00] working and I want to say whatever God
[1:31:03] has done for you brothers and
[1:31:06] sisters it is not the

[1:31:49] ashamed there is more
[1:31:52] God is going to do for
[1:31:54] us it is just the
[1:31:56] beginning and then from that
[1:31:59] phase came another phas God saw you are
[1:32:03] good you are depending on him he said
[1:32:06] now let me give you a good job a good
[1:32:09] job which will keep you in my
[1:32:11] presence that was another
[1:32:14] phase after that phase then he says Ah
[1:32:17] do I trust you now okay let me give you
[1:32:20] my daughter now and God gave you his
[1:32:22] daughter that was another phase brother
[1:32:26] can I prophesy to you this evening this
[1:32:28] morning that is just the beginning more

[1:32:33] coming Hallelujah not only for Brother D
[1:32:38] but for every message believer
[1:32:41] today Hallelujah God works in
[1:32:46] phases God works in
[1:32:48] phases and now that we are going into
[1:32:50] another year
[1:32:53] we are on a we have been on a phase in
[1:32:54] our
[1:32:55] life and maybe waiting on the Lord to do
[1:32:58] certain things in our
[1:33:01] life but I want to uh have this
[1:33:03] inspiration as God gave it to
[1:33:07] me you know crossing
[1:33:10] over I just had those words crossing
[1:33:12] over everybody's talking about crossing
[1:33:15] over so I wondered why God brought it to
[1:33:18] my mind as
[1:33:19] well and then I felt crossing over
[1:33:23] not to another
[1:33:24] year but to the next
[1:33:27] phase hallelujah hallelujah amen praise
[1:33:32] God and so I want to take
[1:33:35] that so it and run it through with how
[1:33:38] God dealt with the
[1:33:42] Jews the Jews were a chosen people of
[1:33:46] God in Egypt however they were under
[1:33:50] bondage you may have been under bondage
[1:33:53] this
[1:33:54] year but I want to say you are a chosen
[1:33:56] people of
[1:33:58] God they were
[1:34:00] lost without God and
[1:34:03] undone you remember how you were lost
[1:34:05] and
[1:34:07] undone until when they were in Egypt for
[1:34:12] long for many years they were lost and
[1:34:18] done without God and
[1:34:23] God sent a
[1:34:26] prophet my God to those of you who have
[1:34:30] Revelation are already shouting
[1:34:33] amen because you are not hearing about
[1:34:36] Jews you are hearing about
[1:34:39] you I was lost in the denominations I
[1:34:44] was undone I was nothing until God sent
[1:34:48] a
[1:34:49] prophet in this generation
[1:34:52] and this Prophet that
[1:34:54] came he came with a message of
[1:34:59] restoration I say hallelujah amen we to
[1:35:02] have received a message of
[1:35:05] restoration we must be
[1:35:08] restored our hearts must be
[1:35:11] turned we cannot stop
[1:35:14] it and listen to this the devil cannot
[1:35:18] stop
[1:35:19] it see it this way
[1:35:22] when God met
[1:35:23] Moses and he told him I'm sending you to
[1:35:26] the
[1:35:28] Jews to my
[1:35:30] people God had already made up his
[1:35:33] mind and nothing can stop the mind of
[1:35:38] God the moment God made a
[1:35:41] decision to send
[1:35:43] Moses that moment when he made a
[1:35:47] decision to send Moses that moment
[1:35:52] God had seen that it will work
[1:35:55] out because Moses was from
[1:35:58] God and Moses had gone to only execute
[1:36:02] what God has
[1:36:06] decided now the Jews whether they
[1:36:09] accepted or
[1:36:11] refused they could not stop
[1:36:16] it the devil in this case it was Pharaoh
[1:36:23] he could not stop
[1:36:25] it now let me preach to you here here
[1:36:28] today at dvf
[1:36:30] here when God
[1:36:33] decided to send a prophet in our
[1:36:37] generation he had you in
[1:36:40] mind he had you in
[1:36:43] mind and not you
[1:36:45] yourself you cannot stop
[1:36:48] it you cannot stop the purpose of God
[1:36:53] I want you to receive this
[1:36:54] Revelation receive it personally in your
[1:36:58] soul you cannot stop
[1:37:01] it your bad behavior cannot stop
[1:37:05] it your unbelief cannot hinder
[1:37:09] God God will accomplish his
[1:37:13] plan and not only that even the Devil
[1:37:18] Himself cannot stop it because the
[1:37:21] message has
[1:37:23] come and the prophet has come with a
[1:37:27] message they must cross
[1:37:29] over they must cross
[1:37:31] over from Egypt they must cross over the
[1:37:36] Red Sea and they must go over into the
[1:37:40] promised
[1:37:42] land that was a phase in their
[1:37:45] life that they were in at
[1:37:47] first you know how they went to
[1:37:50] Egypt was through
[1:37:52] Joseph you remember how everybody was
[1:37:55] hungry at that
[1:37:57] time let me ask you a question who took
[1:38:00] the Israelites to
[1:38:03] Egypt answer
[1:38:06] me god so God took them to
[1:38:10] Egypt
[1:38:12] ah God took them to Egypt how many agree
[1:38:16] with me this
[1:38:19] morning you are not agree with me
[1:38:21] because you don't know how God
[1:38:24] works
[1:38:26] God took them to
[1:38:29] Egypt why because it was Hallelujah it
[1:38:33] was
[1:38:34] God who amen allowed the brothers of
[1:38:39] Joseph to sell him to
[1:38:42] Egypt and you remember brother bam says
[1:38:45] Joseph is the type of Jesus
[1:38:49] Christ and when they sold him
[1:38:52] and and and the Egyptians found him when
[1:38:53] they threw him down there and the
[1:38:55] Egyptians found
[1:38:57] him what happened they took him and he
[1:39:01] ended up into P I think P's
[1:39:04] house and while he was there you know
[1:39:07] the wife of
[1:39:08] Piper wanted to have
[1:39:11] him but he escaped her he said I'm not
[1:39:15] going to defile
[1:39:17] myself Joseph was
[1:39:20] pure just like Jesus Jesus was the pure
[1:39:25] he was the Lamb of God that takes away
[1:39:28] the sins of the
[1:39:29] world Hallelujah and then when he went
[1:39:32] to
[1:39:33] prison you know one prisoner was set
[1:39:37] free and another one was
[1:39:40] not that shows
[1:39:42] us Jesus when he was on the cross amen
[1:39:47] one
[1:39:48] prisoner was set free he told him you
[1:39:52] will be with me in Paradise in other
[1:39:55] words you have been set
[1:39:57] free you are saved but another one went
[1:40:02] to
[1:40:03] hell Joseph a type of Jesus
[1:40:08] Christ and then out of the Cross he
[1:40:11] came and what did he become amen he
[1:40:15] became a
[1:40:16] prince Joseph became a
[1:40:19] prince next to
[1:40:21] Pharaoh he was a prince among the
[1:40:26] people what has Jesus
[1:40:29] become Jesus is a
[1:40:32] prince Hallelujah to
[1:40:35] Joseph Egypt there were
[1:40:38] Gentiles they were uncalled people they
[1:40:42] were bad people to Jesus to us we are
[1:40:47] Gentiles we are bad people and called
[1:40:51] people but God in his Rich
[1:40:55] mes he called
[1:40:57] Jesus when he came down on
[1:41:00] Earth what did he do he came to the
[1:41:04] Gentiles where does he become a
[1:41:07] prince where did Joseph get a wife
[1:41:11] from Joseph got a wife from among the
[1:41:15] Gentile
[1:41:18] [Music]
[1:41:19] Egyptians how many receiving Revelation
[1:41:22] now he received a wife from the gentle
[1:41:28] Egyptians not from the
[1:41:30] Jews and Jesus is getting a
[1:41:34] bride not from Israel but from the
[1:41:38] Gentiles from me and you Hallelujah and
[1:41:43] he said there is something I'm going to
[1:41:46] do if you are my brothers
[1:41:49] indeed he said to
[1:41:52] them without telling them and revealing
[1:41:55] himself to them he said to them go and
[1:41:59] bring my brother
[1:42:01] Benjamin and when Benjamin is
[1:42:04] here I will tell you what next and let
[1:42:08] me tell you they went away and brought
[1:42:11] all the
[1:42:14] people including
[1:42:17] Benjamin
[1:42:18] Hallelujah there is a revelation
[1:42:22] but before Benjamin could
[1:42:24] arrive before Joseph would address
[1:42:27] himself to his
[1:42:29] brothers after Benjamin had
[1:42:32] arrived something
[1:42:34] happened Joseph told his
[1:42:37] wife his Egyptian
[1:42:40] wife go in the palace go in the palace
[1:42:44] take the children with you there is
[1:42:46] something I must
[1:42:48] do and Jesus is's going to do the same
[1:42:51] same
[1:42:52] thing the same thing he's going to tell
[1:42:55] you his wife go in the
[1:42:58] palace go in the Rapture I must go to my
[1:43:04] brothers the Jews and reveal myself to
[1:43:08] them when is he going to do
[1:43:11] that during the
[1:43:15] tribulation during the
[1:43:17] tribulation what is Jesus going to do
[1:43:21] he's going to reveal
[1:43:23] himself to the
[1:43:25] Jews but that will be after the
[1:43:29] Rapture so I am thinking of the
[1:43:32] Rapture I am thinking of the Rapture in
[1:43:36] a blessed home on
[1:43:38] Earth when the redeemed are gathering
[1:43:41] in the Saints will sing that
[1:43:44] answer they will be from all
[1:43:47] over they will not have church names on
[1:43:50] them
[1:43:52] they will have the name of Jesus Christ
[1:43:54] on them Hallelujah they'll be called a
[1:43:58] bride they'll be called a word
[1:44:01] bride are you in that
[1:44:04] number are you in that number sister I
[1:44:07] am glad I'll be in that
[1:44:09] number they will be from Ethiopia
[1:44:12] they'll be from Uganda they be from
[1:44:14] Kenya there be from America from all
[1:44:17] over the world members of the body
[1:44:21] of Jesus
[1:44:23] Christ Hallelujah am so it was in his
[1:44:28] plan he went to
[1:44:31] Egypt to find a
[1:44:33] wife so Jesus came among the
[1:44:37] Gentiles to find a
[1:44:40] bride and in the same way we can say
[1:44:43] that Jesus Took the
[1:44:45] Jews to
[1:44:48] Egypt it was all part of the plan
[1:44:53] hallelujah amen and now if God took them
[1:44:58] there it is up to God to remove
[1:45:02] them that's why he says when when he
[1:45:05] closes the
[1:45:07] door no man can
[1:45:10] open and when he opens the
[1:45:12] door no man can
[1:45:14] close now let me tell you while God
[1:45:17] works with you in
[1:45:19] phases
[1:45:21] when he opens the first
[1:45:23] phase no man can
[1:45:27] close and this reminds me when I was in
[1:45:30] the streets of
[1:45:32] Ethiopia one of the first trips I had
[1:45:34] there in 2013 we did not know where the
[1:45:38] Believers
[1:45:40] are but God knew it because they were in
[1:45:43] his mind before the foundation of the
[1:45:45] world I was just one sent
[1:45:48] there and I were walking on the streets
[1:45:52] and we had already been rejected by many
[1:45:54] people I was with brother Paul on that
[1:45:56] trip that was my second
[1:45:58] trip and we were walking on the street
[1:46:01] and then a man came and ped me on the
[1:46:05] back he said
[1:46:07] Hallelujah I said hallelujah hallelujah
[1:46:10] that's a good
[1:46:11] language so I said who are you who are
[1:46:14] you so we introduced one another so we
[1:46:16] went on the restaurant and sat down and
[1:46:19] the man the spirit of God Came Upon
[1:46:23] him and he began to prophesy I love
[1:46:26] prophecy
[1:46:28] friends true prophecy happens by the
[1:46:32] way did you know that that's why the
[1:46:35] Bible says we should CT those
[1:46:38] things despite not any
[1:46:42] prophesying I've seen people who are
[1:46:44] prophesied
[1:46:48] too but me I don't profess despise any
[1:46:53] prophecy because if you receive it it
[1:46:57] comes to pass and that man began to
[1:47:00] prophesy over me he said I see a
[1:47:03] light it's right here on your
[1:47:06] head I say it's a pure
[1:47:09] message God is saying I've opened
[1:47:12] Ethiopia for
[1:47:13] you and you are going to take that pure
[1:47:16] message in every corner of
[1:47:19] Ethiopia no man will close that
[1:47:22] door so I said
[1:47:25] amen after that I began preaching to him
[1:47:28] this pure
[1:47:31] message but that man never received
[1:47:34] it but God had the we in
[1:47:38] mind fa in mind God had many others in
[1:47:41] mind let me tell you this is a work of
[1:47:45] God it's not up to a
[1:47:48] man it is up to to
[1:47:51] God and God will call his
[1:47:54] own no man can stop
[1:47:57] it when the phase when the time for the
[1:48:00] next phase has
[1:48:03] come no man can stop that
[1:48:07] phase and by the time I left
[1:48:09] Ethiopia there were about maybe maximum
[1:48:12] 150
[1:48:15] Believers but right now with all the
[1:48:17] testimonies I'm
[1:48:19] hearing I believe it is going almost to
[1:48:21] a
[1:48:23] thousand who called them not me not a
[1:48:27] man what is God
[1:48:30] doing God opens phases phases phes
[1:48:34] phes and even in your life who brought
[1:48:38] you where you
[1:48:39] were not you not an
[1:48:43] organization God brought you where you
[1:48:45] are
[1:48:46] now and I'm telling you it is time to
[1:48:50] cross over into the next
[1:48:56] phase
[1:48:58] Hallelujah and when the time came for
[1:49:01] Israel Pharaoh could not stop
[1:49:04] it the devil cannot
[1:49:06] stop this crossing over into the next
[1:49:11] pH your unbelief can't stop
[1:49:14] it hallelujah
[1:49:17] amen hallelujah my God amen I want to
[1:49:21] look at something here
[1:49:22] today in the message why are we not a
[1:49:25] denomination but bam
[1:49:28] says Moses sometime I look around and
[1:49:33] say you know that bunch of fanatic
[1:49:39] Pentecostals brother bham why would you
[1:49:41] ever go with that Bunch like that
[1:49:49] for you know what Moses looked upon the
[1:49:53] children of
[1:49:55] Israel he looked out of the same
[1:49:59] window that Pharaoh looked out
[1:50:03] of pharaoh looked at
[1:50:05] them as a bunch of mad
[1:50:10] dabbers but
[1:50:12] Moses looked out of the same
[1:50:15] window and he looked upon them as the
[1:50:19] chosen of God
[1:50:22] hallelujah oh glory to God you know when
[1:50:26] the devil looks at
[1:50:28] you the Bible says Satan is the accuser
[1:50:31] of the
[1:50:35] Brethren and you have
[1:50:37] people who are very good rumor
[1:50:41] mongers and they tell this they tell
[1:50:45] that and they break the hearts of
[1:50:48] people and some people become
[1:50:51] discouraged Let Me Tell those people are
[1:50:53] being used by
[1:50:57] Satan to to discourage
[1:51:00] people but let me tell you brother don't
[1:51:03] be used by
[1:51:04] Satan don't accuse any of your
[1:51:09] brother there's something I want you to
[1:51:11] get here the Bible says if any of
[1:51:16] you offended one of the little ones
[1:51:21] it is better for a milestone a stone a
[1:51:25] huge to be put in your in your in your
[1:51:29] neck and they throw you in the
[1:51:33] sea do you know what it means to
[1:51:36] God about his little
[1:51:38] one about his
[1:51:41] bride about his
[1:51:44] church to God they are
[1:51:47] precious far more than rubies
[1:51:51] far more than all the words put
[1:51:54] together oh I am so precious to God you
[1:51:58] are so precious to
[1:52:00] God and if you or anybody will offend
[1:52:04] one of those little
[1:52:07] ones that is the worst thing you can
[1:52:12] do and we see here Pharaoh was despising
[1:52:16] them he was looking at them as a bunch
[1:52:19] of M
[1:52:22] daers ah look at them look at the other
[1:52:25] look look but when the prophet of God
[1:52:30] came my don't don't don't close this
[1:52:33] open your heart to receive this when the
[1:52:36] prophet of God came he looked at through
[1:52:39] the same
[1:52:40] window what did he
[1:52:42] see what did he
[1:52:44] see the chosen people of
[1:52:48] God it's not about the the prophet it's
[1:52:51] about the message he
[1:52:54] has it's about the revelation God has
[1:52:56] given
[1:52:57] him let let me tell you
[1:52:59] Brethren this end time
[1:53:02] message is not William
[1:53:07] Bram no say what I said this entire
[1:53:11] message is not William Bram Bram this
[1:53:15] enti
[1:53:16] message is what William Bram spoke
[1:53:21] it was not his
[1:53:24] mind he has no copyright on
[1:53:27] it it is the mind of
[1:53:31] God and when it
[1:53:33] came it was the mind of God about his
[1:53:39] people and then through that message he
[1:53:42] said
[1:53:43] this if the
[1:53:45] people shall know who they are the
[1:53:48] bright shall know who she
[1:53:51] is and what she
[1:53:55] represents the devil cannot defeat

[2:05:39] intellectual
[2:05:44] Faith the any time
[2:05:47] message oh somebody must see
[2:05:50] today Moses took the entire
[2:05:55] message to Israelites who were in
[2:05:58] bondage that enti
[2:06:01] message had two
[2:06:03] things in it the first
[2:06:07] thing was to liberate

[2:06:15] Gan amen are you following me
[2:06:19] when they in
[2:06:21] gion they were supposed to be
[2:06:25] liberated time had to
[2:06:28] come when the Ang of death would
[2:06:31] come and they nothing would happen
[2:06:36] to meaning the
[2:06:39] calamities that fall upon the
[2:06:42] Egyptians God by the end message of

[2:06:56] troubles that is your bad situations
[2:07:00] that's your tears that's your heart
[2:07:02] breaks that's all those things when the
[2:07:05] end time message

[2:07:35] over today the Ang of death must pass
[2:07:41] over you see this is a portion of the
[2:07:44] message many of us don't look

[2:31:47] to fight for
[2:31:50] you you can read your Bible from cover
[2:31:52] to
[2:31:53] cover that is how it has been in every
[2:31:57] battle it was with Gideon even Joshua
[2:32:03] when they reach the promised land you
[2:32:05] remember in Jero he told them the only
[2:32:07] thing you have to do is run
[2:32:15] around
[2:32:16] imagine
[2:32:18] St St St seven
[2:32:23] days and people were
[2:32:25] laughing they started with
[2:32:27] laughing but by the time
[2:32:31] they they
[2:32:34] like but this is becoming
[2:32:39] serious they kept looking at the walls
[2:32:42] and as long as the walls were
[2:32:44] up they no problem
[2:32:47] we are fine when the devil
[2:32:51] thinks he has

[2:33:18] because when they went over Jero around
[2:33:21] Jero the walls came
[2:33:23] down at a time nobody
[2:33:27] expected we can look at many other
[2:33:30] battles but because of time let come
[2:33:32] back
[2:33:33] here God told the
[2:33:36] Israelites go in that place where the
[2:33:40] devil and the Pharaoh will be begin to
[2:33:42] think the Wilderness has
[2:33:45] shut and when he
[2:33:47] thinks the wild shut you
[2:33:50] in then I will harden
[2:33:55] his and he will come to
[2:33:58] [Music]
[2:34:02] attack

[2:34:18] overcome he has laid the trap to make
[2:34:21] the devil thing you are not you don't
[2:34:24] understand you have no you have lost
[2:34:27] hope now you're going to give
[2:34:31] up the Devil comes
[2:34:34] to that is the biggest mistake the devil
[2:34:36] has
[2:34:37] made every time the Devil comes
[2:34:40] to we have no strength to
[2:34:42] overcome the Bible says the devil he
[2:34:46] comes he's like a roaring
[2:34:49] Li seeking whom he
[2:34:55] will and when he comes to
[2:34:57] you he thinks you you can easily be
[2:35:04] eaten can you imagine
[2:35:06] fortunate the devil making such a
[2:35:09] mistake thinking you you can easily be
[2:35:12] eaten and then he comes your way that's
[2:35:16] what he
[2:35:17] did and Pharaoh said ah the Wilderness
[2:35:22] has swallowed
[2:35:23] them let us go and get
[2:35:26] them can can we finish this chapter
[2:35:29] now follow me closely
[2:35:34] here and I will harden Pharaoh's heart
[2:35:36] that he shall follow after
[2:35:40] them and I'll will be honored upon
[2:35:43] pharaoh and upon all the his host I will
[2:35:46] be honored that the Egyptians may know
[2:35:48] that I am the
[2:35:51] Lord and they did so and it was told the
[2:35:54] king of Egypt that the people
[2:35:59] fled and the Heart of the Pharaoh and
[2:36:02] the Heart of pharaoh and of his servants
[2:36:03] was turned against the
[2:36:07] people and they said why have we done
[2:36:11] this that we have left Israel go from
[2:36:14] serving us
[2:36:17] and he made ready his
[2:36:20] Chariot and took his people with
[2:36:23] him and he took 600 chosen
[2:36:27] chariots and all the Chariots of
[2:36:30] Egypt and over every one of them and the
[2:36:34] captains and the Lord hardened the heart
[2:36:38] of
[2:36:40] pharaoh and he pursued after the
[2:36:42] children of
[2:36:43] Israel and the children of Israel went
[2:36:45] out with an high
[2:36:49] hand but the Egyptians pursued after
[2:36:53] them all the horses and Chariots
[2:36:56] of and his Horsemen and his
[2:37:01] army verse 10 and when Pharaoh Drew
[2:37:05] n the children of Israel lifted up their
[2:37:09] eyes and
[2:37:11] behold the Egyptians marched after
[2:37:14] them and they were so
[2:37:17] afraid and the children of Israel cried
[2:37:19] out the
[2:37:21] Lord and they said unto
[2:37:23] Moses because there were no graves in
[2:37:27] Egypt you have taken us away to die in
[2:37:30] the
[2:37:32] wilderness where thou dealt thus with
[2:37:36] us to carry us forth out of
[2:37:39] Egypt whenever people begin looking at
[2:37:42] the shortcomings of their
[2:37:44] pastor
[2:37:49] there's a problem in their
[2:37:52] faith whenever people begin

[2:46:14] Israel and here was the pill of
[2:46:17] fire and here was thep
[2:46:20] Egyptian and in the
[2:46:23] morning the Lord began
[2:46:28] watching
[2:46:30] looking the
[2:46:34] Egyptians
[2:46:36] through the pill of
[2:46:42] fire

[2:47:19] same he's behind you
[2:47:22] here and he looking at your
[2:47:25] Devils he's looking at
[2:47:28] Pharaoh through the pill of

[2:47:56] phase they are leaving your

[2:48:13] over next
[2:48:16] pH he looks through the pill of
[2:48:19] fire and he says
[2:48:22] here and took and and and it says and
[2:48:29] troubled the host of the
[2:48:34] Egyptians by a simple
[2:48:41] look the eyes of the Lord are powerful
[2:48:49] let me tell you the prayer you should
[2:48:50] pray
[2:48:52] tonight God look at my

[2:49:28] wheels when God begins destroying your
[2:49:31] enemy Oh Glory God he does not destroy
[2:49:33] him once in a
[2:49:38] minute he beat Slowly by slowly oh my
[2:49:43] God he destroys one by one
[2:49:47] that's why the demons seem as if they
[2:49:49] not
[2:49:51] living because God is dealing with him
[2:49:54] by
[2:49:56] little little by little one by one will

[3:22:26] the our friends in
[3:22:28] Kenya several of them even from Western
[3:22:31] Kenya have already confirmed to
[3:22:36] come I see already about almost 40
[3:22:39] confirming from
[3:22:40] there
[3:22:44] from Nairobi and and Western
[3:22:49] Kya as well as I have several who have
[3:22:52] confirmed from uh the um the the Eastern
[3:23:01] Uganda more than 15 I've already
[3:23:04] confirmed
[3:23:06] from where's the brother from where is
[3:23:09] he have you reged for the meetings
[3:23:12] no so 15 excluding you so you should
[3:23:19] register several Brothers we have is
[3:23:21] quite
[3:23:22] far but if you hear if you hear Brothers
[3:23:25] sacrificing to
[3:23:28] come it's a big
[3:23:30] sacrifice is almost at the bo of
[3:23:32] Ethiopia and
[3:23:38] Kenya
[3:23:40] sud you you know it's a sacrifice for
[3:23:43] them to
[3:23:44] come also we have our brothers that have
[3:23:47] already
[3:23:49] confirmed who will be ministering to the
[3:23:51] young
[3:23:53] people uh the brothers from uh New
[3:23:59] Zealand now brother
[3:24:02] Timothy also
[3:24:04] confirmed but a few days ago when I was
[3:24:07] in
[3:24:08] Kenya he asked me to pray mother in-law
[3:24:12] was sick and his
[3:24:18] wife and uh because if things don't go
[3:24:22] well then he will need to be with the
[3:24:27] family but yesterday night I believe it
[3:24:30] was when he told me that she is
[3:24:36] improving so you
[3:24:38] pray that the devil because I see the
[3:24:41] devil is fighting so
[3:24:43] much him from
[3:24:45] coming he already bought his
[3:24:47] ticket he's done his hotel and
[3:24:51] everything already taken the sh he has
[3:24:54] already taken the
[3:24:58] sh he's prepared but the devil is
[3:25:01] fighting from he told me these words the
[3:25:03] devil is fighting from all
[3:25:06] Corners to hind
[3:25:09] him before I had announced that these
[3:25:13] brothers were
[3:25:15] coming a brother from
[3:25:18] Mas sent a message that he had seen two
[3:25:21] brothers
[3:25:24] coming White
[3:25:26] Brothers so God had already planned it
[3:25:30] before is trying to hinder
[3:25:34] it it means that there is something
[3:25:37] going to
[3:25:38] happen so let's pray against as the
[3:25:41] plans of
[3:25:44] and sister f you remember the testimony
[3:25:45] I gave
[3:25:47] you of a sister that God used to speak
[3:25:49] to me when I was in trouble
[3:25:54] about how many remember
[3:26:10] that
[3:26:16] this is the sister right
[3:26:19] here this is the sister God used
[3:26:22] her and so sister God used you the devil
[3:26:25] is fighting
[3:26:27] this but he cannot Prevail
[3:26:30] God he cannot
[3:26:32] Prevail amen God is
[3:26:36] concerned speaking from people to people
[3:26:39] in
[3:26:40] Ethiopia Western
[3:26:43] Uganda many
[3:26:46] places told us what God is going to
[3:26:49] do my burden for these
[3:26:54] meetings is not
[3:26:56] really
[3:26:57] uh counseling is
[3:27:00] [Music]
[3:27:04] good celing is
[3:27:06] good and I believe pastors do a good job
[3:27:09] on
[3:27:10] that but the purpose I have for these
[3:27:13] meetings is not really counseling young
[3:27:20] people but it is uh to lead them to an
[3:27:24] experience with
[3:27:28] God because you see when you meet
[3:27:31] him everything else is
[3:27:35] solved and so we should pray and be in
[3:27:38] prayer for our children and other young
[3:27:40] people that come
[3:27:44] this is how God is leading
[3:27:46] us and we'll have service after
[3:27:51] service and with all the ministers who
[3:27:54] are coming men of
[3:27:56] God I believe God is going to them we
[3:28:01] have some young people coming from as
[3:28:02] far as South
[3:28:04] Africa Africa and uh and some from
[3:28:08] Zimbabwe so it's really going to be an
[3:28:10] international youth
[3:28:14] and the ones in ethopia have come
[3:28:19] early and are now going to go back
[3:28:22] ear but atast they will be represented
[3:28:25] by their pastor and his
[3:28:28] wife because you also take one of the
[3:28:30] meetings in the
[3:28:34] Mee amen amen so continue
[3:28:39] contributing there is a sister
[3:28:42] that streams our
[3:28:46] services on a regular
[3:28:49] basis and yesterday I showed it to one
[3:28:56] brother when she heard about um uh the
[3:29:00] uh our
[3:29:04] preparations she gave an offering
[3:29:06] towards the support of the young
[3:29:10] people
[3:29:14] a sum of about 1.8
[3:29:20] Millions amen and that is in
[3:29:24] addition to what God had already
[3:29:26] provided
[3:29:28] previously so we still need a lot of
[3:29:31] money but our God is a
[3:29:34] provider friends these meetings are
[3:29:36] being organized 100% by
[3:29:40] faith
[3:29:44] most of the young people
[3:29:45] registering we have almost 200 now have
[3:29:50] registered but all these ones most of
[3:29:53] them are saying they will need F
[3:30:00] help to fully take care of one person at
[3:30:03] the
[3:30:05] meetings to rent the
[3:30:08] venue pay the food
[3:30:12] and the
[3:30:13] accommodation one person it will take a
[3:30:16] minimum of
[3:30:21] 120,000 and so we requested each young
[3:30:24] person to contribute
[3:30:27] 50,000 and then we as the church can
[3:30:30] bear the rest of the
[3:30:34] burden but even with the
[3:30:38] 50,000 many are saying when they that
[3:30:41] they will not be able to contribute all
[3:30:44] of
[3:30:47] it and others can't contribute anything
[3:30:49] at
[3:30:51] all but they desire to come so we are
[3:30:54] not going to hinder anyone from
[3:30:57] coming whoever wants to come tell them
[3:31:00] to
[3:31:04] come
[3:31:06] amen God is going to
[3:31:09] provide and we are not going to burden
[3:31:12] our visiting
[3:31:15] ministers like we did in the past
[3:31:18] meetings we did not burden
[3:31:21] them we took care of
[3:31:24] everything and we should do the same
[3:31:26] this
[3:31:28] time we should set that
[3:31:32] history having God provided for
[3:31:38] that not because of us but because of
[3:31:42] the vision that he has given to
[3:31:44] us God will support his own
[3:31:48] work and he will use people that are
[3:31:50] burdened for
[3:31:52] it so give and it shall be given to
