name of jesus christ we pray amen yeah may god bless you i greet you all in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ while we are still standing let us go straight to the scriptures we're reading from the book of jeremiah chapter 29 and we shall begin from far that says the lord that after 70 years be accomplished at babylon i will visit you and perform my good words toward you in causing you to return to this place for i know that those that i have i know the thoughts that i think toward you says the lord thought of peace and not of evil to give you unexpected end then shall you call upon me and you shall go and pray unto me and i will hearken unto you and he shall seek me and find me when you shall search for me with all your heart and i will be fond of you says the lord and i will turn away your captivity and i will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where uh whether i have driven you says the lord and i will bring you again and to the place whence i caused you to be carried away away captive and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] uh i want us to share something about desperation okabian [Music] praise you to god amina amen and uh desperation i will start by describing what inspiration means you know this person says desperation means uh hopelessness desperation obama uganda that's according to uh somebody explained desperation like that then another one says is the feeling that you have when you are in such a bad situation desperation yo [Music] you are willing to take risk in order another one says desperation is the feeling that you that you have when you are in such a bad situation that you will try anything to [Music] we may not finish all the meaning of it twins praise be to jesus come here now tonight i want us to talk about the inspiration now [Music] entire within us [Music] we are going to share something about desperation i never will not finish it today [Music] the inspiration for a few minutes now usually it takes a set of emergency to draw us into inspiration [Music] it is that to burn it has to do that but human beings are so slaughterful in their mind that it takes it takes an emergency something arises and when they do then it throws them into desperation are you [Music] it brings out the real thing that you are [Music] [Music] you remember don't forget our few definitions about inspiration unless you have no other solutions where is which god mean and the prophet says it takes the spirit of emotion he throws us into desperation [Music] is what brings out what we are really made out of praise be to god there are some people when the prophet [Music] because [Music] [Music] was taken in emergency [Music] i believe it says it is [Music] they knew that time god was fixing to destroy judgment [Music] have you ever bothered to ask yourself about this why are you waiting for the second song you know what is for all the spiritual failed people what's the prophet tells us without the amen amen we must identify ourselves with our sacrifices foreign [Music] amen mean we may god give us desperation catholic the when the years the seventh years was getting close god said i will refuse it to you and perform my good words [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] i [Music] [Music] [Music] come here the prophecy they are seeing the great hand of god miracles it was shaking time it was the [Music] [Music] amen i mean that big black wing yep dropped down from the sky like a smoke settling over the city the screams coming [Music] he's talking about the passover eve the passover event when god told them to slaughter a lamb the blood on the devil messiah [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but we need to catch the revelation of the hour later we need to know the things we are living in praise be to god you know these things will continue just like this do you think jeremiah was the only jews in babylon do you think all the people were the only ones in public because they knew that after 17 years things are going on every interview there is invisible union between the pride and the groom remember this is the secret catching away this takes [Music] let us leave our comfort zones is ah yeah i have this and that's ah yeah i have food at home the marijuana is talking and then you relax i can't study now [Music] [Music] [Music] all to go on our knees we are hearing about the holy spirit every day people have prepared to be filled with the spirit of god the holy [Applause] amen the bible says [Applause] [Applause] because you cannot tell him for me if you want to come maybe let us meet at coffee table and then you come back praise be to god amen you just said god have your [Music] all of us [Music] tension you can think that the guy is coming for you praise be to god because time is normal one more day to teach arena when they are taking the that passover around children with very valuable manner with their shoes from their feet from their house [Music] [Music] excitement [Music] [Music] god seek us [Music] you just need to be balanced the bible says that seek me yet i can still be found amen amen at the end of the message see the action of the great holy spirit he's talking uh of effects after the preaching of the world are you okay [Music] even put it in the papers and magazines then come in and take the end of god same with seven we have had all this they we have ready them to be sami amen he says the inspiration is sign of the coming [Applause] is coming from every member of christ into desperation and about our souls [Music] are going to amount to it if we gain the whole world [Applause] now what are we teaching what are we [Music] what are you struggling for right now to live what are you leaving for [Music] me to die and what are you what are you looking for to die and what are you oh and you are not fit to live until you are afraid to die it is true original [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] is that true and you are not free to live until your feet to die are you free to die brother now he fixed today die of your own son [Music] must [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because of too much satisfaction of food that is the heart past praise be to god amen [Music] you see the bible says today [Music] [Music] even [Applause] with [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as long as we still have plan abc up to x [Music] you will not see god christian have planned a only [Music] [Music] [Music] you may do all those strategic praise be to god here but whoever to revolution when we are fine and we are just settled in there to carry and we sing there is a rule [Music] [Music] my thank you [Music] but what i'm trying to say nation number let us sing that when we know that all is real the world is leaves [Music] [Music] and where is she going she's not going in the bathroom she's going praise [Music] this world is getting right for judgment it is thinking before god hey when it comes to meaning when he found this way she's [Music] [Applause] oh that's where our power is it was like he was sitting [Music] is there is praise be to god maybe we friends we are living in the world of competition in the business world never all about business even in the church even in the spiritual world there are people who want prayerless night and day praise be to god come here they are believers who pray every day [Music] [Music] about to finish in the community amen and they begin to restore back the gifts and the things that was in the church [Music] because they were born of the spirit god [Music] it was transfigured and it was uh and his rematch shined like the sun there is said this is my beloved [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] he and sometimes that very thing that you receive as the holy spirit they really say that english it is and upon again of the spirit then listen to those who have the holy spirit who claim to have all those who have now listened if you don't rush [Music] against her that same thing will you may wait after that moment now [Music] whether oh the president of uganda [Music] i want [Music] [Music] [Music] i've kept everything since i was young [Music] [Music] do you know that each one of
