[1:21:59] and even myself and my brother Lord we
[1:22:02] take ourselves out of the ways
[1:22:04] nothing good that we can say

[1:22:16] that you have chosen and you have loved
[1:22:20] foreign
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:47] [Music]
[1:22:55] a
[1:23:15] CE
[1:23:21] God bless you
[1:23:23] sir I'd like to greet each of you in the

[1:23:28] it's a blessing to have you and to be in
[1:23:31] the presence of God together
[1:23:34] all the vistas
[1:23:37] for the first time
[1:23:40] I want to say you're welcome
[1:23:46] but now you are you are almost one of us
[1:23:51] and if you want to know why I said
[1:23:53] almost
[1:23:59] amen but the the word there is one of us
[1:24:04] my brother here God bless you
[1:24:07] Charles I'm happy to see you God bless
[1:24:09] you
[1:24:11] and now may we open our Bibles
[1:24:15] of faith we are going to in the book of
[1:24:17] Hebrews chapter 10.
[1:24:22] we are reading out of that verse 35
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:32] foreign
[1:24:36] this is like a continuation of what we
[1:24:38] have been talking about but our title is
[1:24:40] different
[1:24:42] yeah
[1:24:45] because I've been speaking on the power
[1:24:48] of Revelation
[1:24:51] today our title is different
[1:24:54] under the same Inspirations
[1:25:03] this morning and she said they had taken
[1:25:06] a trip
[1:25:09] and they were not able to make it
[1:25:13] but I think it will be streaming the
[1:25:16] service so
[1:25:20] um
[1:25:25] because not away there are for your
[1:25:27] confidence which which has great
[1:25:29] recompense of reward
[1:25:31] for ye have need of patience that after
[1:25:35] ye have done the will of God he might
[1:25:38] receive the promise
[1:25:40] for yet a little while and and he that
[1:25:43] shall come will come
[1:25:45] and will not Tarry now they just shall
[1:25:49] live by faith but if any man draw back
[1:25:51] my soul shall not have my my soul shall
[1:25:55] have no pleasure in him
[1:25:57] but we are not of them who draw back
[1:25:59] unto Perdition but of them that believe
[1:26:03] to the saving of the Soul
[1:26:05] is
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:53] praise the Lord
[1:26:58] I'm requesting that you as usual you
[1:27:00] give me your undivided attention and
[1:27:02] avoid moving out as much as you can if
[1:27:04] you really must go out this is that
[1:27:06] moment and then you come back and we
[1:27:08] hear This Together from
[1:27:15] foreign
[1:27:46] foreign
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:19] foreign
[1:28:38] you see that's why without faith the
[1:28:41] Bible says it is impossible to please
[1:28:44] because if you have no faith you cannot
[1:28:47] know the will of God for your life
[1:28:54] when you don't know for sure what God
[1:28:59] requires for you
[1:29:02] and so faith is an ingredient which
[1:29:05] every Christian should have
[1:29:07] gone
[1:29:08] in order to please God
[1:29:11] down even to what we dress
[1:29:14] you know how we work even the little
[1:29:17] things
[1:29:18] you can do something little and then
[1:29:21] displeases God
[1:29:52] then faith is is the knowledge of what
[1:29:56] God wants you to do
[1:29:58] it
[1:30:01] may not even sometimes be written in the
[1:30:04] Holy Bible questions
[1:30:06] you see but because you were a child of
[1:30:10] God
[1:30:12] with the Holy Spirit
[1:30:14] you know you will you will you receive
[1:30:17] faith and then you will know what
[1:30:20] exactly God wants you to do in
[1:30:51] so this is the reason why Christians go
[1:30:55] to attend fellowships
[1:30:58] the reason we attend Fellowship every
[1:31:00] time is because we want to receive faith
[1:31:05] we want to have faith for our strength
[1:31:09] tough strength to know exactly what to
[1:31:12] do
[1:31:15] all the situations you know sometimes
[1:31:18] when you are down and you you you know
[1:31:20] you're down cast
[1:31:21] foreign
[1:32:21] foreign
[1:32:25] [Applause]
[1:33:22] for ye of need of patience
[1:33:25] after you have done the will of God
[1:33:30] you now might receive the promise
[1:33:34] there are many promises in the Bible
[1:33:37] and here I'm here this morning speaking
[1:33:40] to you how to attain your promises
[1:33:44] this is how you attain your promises
[1:33:47] after you have done the will of God
[1:33:52] Revelations
[1:33:56] Jesus will not tell you yes
[1:33:59] by the way lest we forget Jesus is
[1:34:02] coming back again soon
[1:34:07] I wish you can tell your neighbor that
[1:34:09] is
[1:34:13] Jesus is coming back at you yes
[1:34:20] now the just shall live by faith
[1:34:31] he says they're just
[1:34:33] they Justified
[1:34:36] what is justification
[1:34:40] justification is when you have sinned
[1:35:45] the Bible says you are just foreign
[1:36:40] [Music]
[1:36:42] praise the name of the Lord
[1:36:45] follow me here now
[1:36:46] verses
[1:36:52] shall live by faitha
[1:36:57] praise the name of the Lord
[1:37:01] they just shall live by faith
[1:37:04] but if any man draw
[1:37:07] backwards everybody read with me
[1:37:10] my soul
[1:37:14] shall have no place
[1:37:18] if you've been Justified
[1:37:22] but then he says if any man
[1:37:28] myself
[1:37:40] amen say friends I was reading in the
[1:37:43] Book of Genesis
[1:37:45] you know I read the Bible before but I
[1:37:48] want to read it all through again
[1:37:51] and I'd like to challenge you to do the
[1:37:54] same name
[1:37:56] and see I saw something that I had never
[1:37:58] seen before
[1:38:00] whenever you go to read through the
[1:38:02] Bible you see something new
[1:38:04] because we here in this church now that
[1:38:06] Cain was serpent seeds
[1:38:11] who was later replaced with Sith was the
[1:38:14] seed of God
[1:38:17] says foreign
[1:39:10] oh yeah
[1:39:12] yeah and then when you know when he's
[1:39:14] down you find all the sons after them
[1:39:18] they had hell on them body code on their
[1:39:23] names
[1:39:26] that means L really is a word for God
[1:39:30] is
[1:39:33] you see that that that implies God there
[1:39:37] right there
[1:39:39] that means the house of God is great
[1:39:42] that is
[1:39:58] if you find out later on there was a
[1:40:01] someone born
[1:40:03] praise the name of the Lord let me see
[1:40:06] if I can pick it right quick for you
[1:40:08] here
[1:40:09] I'm going to get my points
[1:40:17] was born
[1:40:20] uh
[1:40:22] um he took
[1:40:24] uh and of course this was the first
[1:40:26] civilization by the way this first
[1:40:27] civilization was made under a king
[1:40:36] that's according to the Bible is the
[1:40:39] first civilization
[1:40:40] Revelation I mean Genesis 4 you will
[1:40:44] know what I'm talking about
[1:40:46] the Bible says took two wives
[1:40:50] and then that's the first time it is
[1:40:53] recorded that somebody took two wives
[1:40:57] and then of course as you go down you
[1:41:01] know this father and father away they
[1:41:02] went from
[1:41:05] so they drew back
[1:41:07] but if you notice
[1:41:10] now speaks of uh safe
[1:41:14] who comes who came on much later
[1:41:18] and now the generations of God or the
[1:41:21] seed of God began to call upon the name
[1:41:22] of the Lord
[1:41:24] foreign
[1:41:47] [Music]
[1:42:26] we are not of them that draw back they
[1:42:29] suffering
[1:43:29] foreign
[1:43:37] [Applause]
[1:43:59] [Applause]
[1:44:12] foreign
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:45] I will not mention the name I called one
[1:44:47] of my friends
[1:44:48] and I asked him preach to me for a
[1:44:50] minute
[1:44:52] I told him I'm going to speak on this
[1:44:54] subject this morning
[1:44:56] but I need someone to preach to me I
[1:44:59] said preach to me yeah immediately the
[1:45:02] Holy Spirit came upon him
[1:45:04] for a minute and then he shared the
[1:45:07] scripture
[1:45:10] I was really encouraged
[1:45:13] to preach what I'm preaching to you and
[1:45:16] one of the things he shared with me
[1:45:20] and he read only one scripture out of
[1:45:22] just his memory
[1:45:24] and he said Jesus said unto him again
[1:45:37] all things are possible
[1:45:39] that is
[1:46:24] [Applause]
[1:46:26] some kind of army and they would go out
[1:46:29] to fight their enemies
[1:46:31] and you know then this little boy was
[1:46:34] trained
[1:46:36] War drums
[1:46:39] and you see like here we know in Uganda
[1:46:42] and other cultures we have different
[1:46:44] types of drum sounds

[1:49:57] nowhere there is no hope for you
[1:50:00] it is
[1:50:04] just a feeling now you can have another

[1:50:55] he will speak to you
[1:50:58] the devil speaks through the mind
[1:51:01] and
[1:51:05] I'm not following my mind
[1:51:07] I'm following my heart because God is
[1:51:11] right in there
[1:51:14] and I'm determined
[1:51:16] not to give up
[1:51:18] one time I spoke to my wife
[1:51:21] and I told her I said something that she
[1:51:25] has never heard

[1:51:31] do I have to be a preacher can't I have
[1:51:35] do this and listen this is successful
[1:51:39] and do other things

[1:52:05] do you have to sing
[1:52:07] do you do you have to to preach brother
[1:52:10] martin again the devil's never told you
[1:52:13] that
[1:52:14] do you have to preach anymore
[1:52:18] do you have to go on the streets
[1:52:26] to you the devil has never told you
[1:52:29] do you have to be a Christian
[1:52:33] what is good about it you are just
[1:52:36] straining yourself
[1:52:39] but those are the voices
[1:52:41] and I've come to you this morning with
[1:52:44] the voice of God
[1:52:52] [Music]
[1:53:17] [Applause]
[1:53:49] always around my friends
[1:54:03] foreign and the devil will tell us to
[1:54:06] surrender
[1:54:07] to retreat today America and we are not
[1:54:10] going to accept it
[1:54:13] in this journey
[1:54:16] you know I want to show you something
[1:54:19] even the devil spoke to Jesus
[1:54:30] you are now discouraged that the devil
[1:54:32] spoke to me that way
[1:54:34] what about if I told you spoke to Jesus
[1:54:39] I hope you still love Jesus
[1:54:42] looked on the 239 and he came out and
[1:54:46] went
[1:54:47] And he as he was want to the Mount of
[1:54:50] Olives and his disciples also followed
[1:54:53] him
[1:54:54] this was the moment when Jesus was about
[1:54:56] to die
[1:54:59] and when he was at the place
[1:55:02] he said unto them pray that he entered
[1:55:06] not into temptation
[1:55:08] and he was withdrawn from them about
[1:55:11] aston's cast
[1:55:15] and kneel down and prayed
[1:55:21] if you foreign
[1:55:52] and I'm telling you what I've
[1:55:54] experienced same
[1:55:56] you you when you were a pastor to the
[1:56:00] people you were Superman
[1:56:03] to the people you never have
[1:56:05] Trials of your own
[1:56:08] for the people you are this give of
[1:56:11] solutions
[1:56:14] to the people you never have any heart
[1:56:16] attack
[1:56:19] but do you know how much pain
[1:56:22] we go through to eat them when you
[1:56:24] preach to somebody don't know what you
[1:56:26] preach to people and they don't change
[1:56:31] or when you preach to somebody and they
[1:56:34] walk away from the truth
[1:56:35] as a matter of fact Maxima somebody
[1:56:38] shared with me a verse
[1:56:40] of what Jesus told the disciples he said
[1:56:44] if you you preach and they don't accept
[1:56:46] if they reject you shake off the doubt
[1:56:50] of you
[1:56:51] could be worse
[1:56:56] do you think it is easy for a preacher
[1:56:58] to cuss somebody
[1:57:03] foreign
[1:57:56] until some have decided to go and do
[1:57:59] some magic
[1:58:02] so that we can show the people it works
[1:58:06] even if I prayed I don't know how many
[1:58:08] people they died
[1:58:15] and so what do we do we have nobody to
[1:58:18] talk to
[1:58:20] encourage us so what do we do we
[1:58:23] encourage ourselves in the Lord
[1:58:25] and look at what God has done look at
[1:58:30] the success
[1:58:34] he can do more
[1:58:50] he said this is difficult
[1:58:56] and he went to God in prayers
[1:59:04] foreign
[1:59:23] [Music]
[1:59:31] [Music]
[1:59:34] Christian
[1:59:36] Lord not my way
[1:59:41] Jesus if he was to use his own wheels
[1:59:45] the Son of God he was not going to die
[1:59:49] for you

[1:59:57] he didn't like it he didn't answer it
[2:00:02] came from Glory
[2:00:08] um
[2:00:12] [Music]

[2:20:32] many of you know that the story
[2:20:35] hero he was many years ago in
[2:20:37] Switzerland
[2:20:40] and how that the Swiss nation was being
[2:20:44] invaded by a mighty Army
[2:20:48] and the cities were being taken
[2:20:51] Blood Of The Swiss people congregated
[2:20:53] from the mountains into the valley with
[2:20:55] such little weapons as they could defend
[2:20:57] themselves
[2:21:06] and he says and when they stood there on
[2:21:09] the field
[2:21:10] and they landed approaching them
[2:21:13] when they were approaching this great
[2:21:15] army
[2:21:16] they were outnumbered
[2:21:19] 51.
[2:21:22] and they wasn't soldiers so they weren't
[2:21:25] trained
[2:21:27] they didn't know what to do
[2:21:30] but this Army that was invading was well
[2:21:33] trained
[2:21:35] every man like a brick wall coming right
[2:21:40] and when they were standing there with
[2:21:42] their Spears moving up
[2:21:45] one great man stepped out
[2:21:48] and his name
[2:21:51] and as he stepped out there in the
[2:21:54] presence
[2:21:55] they were hopeless everything they could
[2:21:59] think of was lost
[2:22:01] they would simply have to go down their
