[1:14:57] chapter
[1:14:59] 1 um um
[1:15:02] vers we can read reread it again just
[1:15:05] just remind
[1:15:10] ourselves just follow it in your Bible
[1:15:12] blessed be the God and the father of our
[1:15:14] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:15:15] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:15:18] places in Heavenly places in
[1:15:21] Christ according as he has chosen Us in
[1:15:24] him before the foundation of the
[1:15:27] world and we that we should be holy and
[1:15:32] Without Blame before him in
[1:15:35] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:15:38] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:15:42] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:15:44] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:15:48] of his grace are are you following
[1:15:50] me to the praise of the glory of his
[1:15:53] grace wherein he has made us accepted in
[1:15:58] the Beloved in whom we have Redemption
[1:16:01] through his blood the Forgiveness of
[1:16:03] sins according to the riches of his
[1:16:04] grace wherein he has abounded toward us
[1:16:07] in all wisdom and Prudence having made
[1:16:10] known unto us the mystery of his will
[1:16:12] according to his good pleasure which he
[1:16:15] his good pleasure which he has purposed
[1:16:19] in himself so he has a
[1:16:23] pleasure that he has already purpos in
[1:16:29] himself he accepted you before you were
[1:16:33] actually into this
[1:16:36] world he chose you in
[1:16:39] him before the foundation of the
[1:16:42] world and he chose you to be
[1:16:45] holy he CH let me put it this way he
[1:16:48] chose you as a holy
[1:16:50] Vel he did not choose you as somebody
[1:16:52] who needed to be made holy
[1:16:56] he CH you
[1:16:57] holy so he calls you
[1:17:01] holy and this is regardless of what
[1:17:03] would happen when you come into the
[1:17:07] world the purpose of the preaching of
[1:17:09] the word is for you to know who you
[1:17:13] are and that's what we are trying to do
[1:17:15] this
[1:17:16] evening trying to remind you who you
[1:17:19] were
[1:17:21] before you came into all this confusion
[1:17:25] one of these glorious
[1:17:27] mornings I tell you we will leave this
[1:17:29] body of
[1:17:32] confusion get we will we will be able to
[1:17:34] step into this reality we are talking
[1:17:38] about sometimes when we talk about this
[1:17:40] reality seems as if it is so
[1:17:44] far but one of these days it will become
[1:17:48] material amen but for now we can be able
[1:17:52] to know that we have all the spiritual
[1:17:55] blessings in Heavenly
[1:18:00] blessing everything has been
[1:18:02] redeemed our soul has been
[1:18:06] redeemed we are waiting for the
[1:18:09] body to be changed and we are waiting
[1:18:12] for this
[1:18:13] Earth to go through its last
[1:18:16] cleansing and then we can be able to
[1:18:18] step into this
[1:18:20] real amen and so what we're talking
[1:18:23] about is something we potentially
[1:18:27] if it's what God
[1:18:29] says it is what God sees and that's what
[1:18:32] as preachers we are going to remind you
[1:18:36] about and and so he says according he
[1:18:39] has according as he has chosen Us in
[1:18:43] him before the foundation of the
[1:18:46] world that we should be
[1:18:49] holy and Without Blame before him in
[1:18:55] predestinated
[1:18:57] us unto the
[1:19:00] adoption of children by Jesus
[1:19:03] Christ to
[1:19:05] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:19:08] of his
[1:19:11] will to the praise of the glory of his
[1:19:16] grace wherein in that Grace he has made
[1:19:20] us accepted in the Beloved
[1:19:28] of course he has made us to be accept in
[1:19:30] Christ he has made us to be
[1:19:35] accepted when you receive Christ you are
[1:19:38] already
[1:19:39] in you are in the
[1:19:42] Beloved so you are his
[1:19:44] beloved you know there's a scripture in
[1:19:46] the book of Song of
[1:19:48] Solomon says I am his
[1:19:51] beloved and he is mine and Banner Over
[1:19:55] Me Is
[1:19:57] loud praise the name of the Lord but
[1:20:01] here we we see in the Book of
[1:20:04] Genesis God comes down and he preaches
[1:20:06] to
[1:20:08] Cain and he tells him Cain if you do
[1:20:12] well will you not be also
[1:20:15] accepted now remember Kane as we saw is
[1:20:20] s Kan Cain was not chosen in him before
[1:20:25] the foundation of the
[1:20:28] world no he was not he was a seed of the
[1:20:32] serpent but here when God comes to
[1:20:35] Cain he even to Cain he does not preach
[1:20:41] condemnation so this gospel is not a
[1:20:44] gospel of
[1:20:46] condemnation it is a gospel of
[1:20:49] salvation for all those who will
[1:20:52] believe they shall receive
[1:20:55] but here he says if you do
[1:20:57] well will you not also be
[1:21:00] accepted and if thou doest not
[1:21:03] well sin lith at the
[1:21:07] door now you would you would say what
[1:21:11] did he have to
[1:21:13] do to be accepted by
[1:21:16] God did he have to do
[1:21:20] something many times we think there's
[1:21:22] something we have to do
[1:21:26] to be accepted by
[1:21:28] God I don't know whether you have ever
[1:21:30] asked yourself that
[1:21:32] question what can I do that I will be in
[1:21:36] the good books with
[1:21:38] God what can I do that God will do this
[1:21:41] for me what can I do and here God is
[1:21:45] very busy
[1:21:46] telling if you do well so tonight want
[1:21:50] we want to understand what is this that
[1:21:52] you have to do
[1:21:55] to do well to be accepted by God because
[1:22:00] it appears as if God is telling
[1:22:03] Kain there was something that he Kan had
[1:22:06] to
[1:22:08] do but I want you to
[1:22:10] remember Abel offered gave an
[1:22:13] offering gave an offering AB brought the
[1:22:17] best Kan brought the best so if it was
[1:22:21] about
[1:22:22] offering they gave offering
[1:22:25] but Kan was not
[1:22:27] accepting if it was about
[1:22:30] presentation he did the best
[1:22:33] presentation
[1:22:34] that but still he was not accepted if it
[1:22:38] was about dressing it was about the
[1:22:41] altar it was about keeping all the laws
[1:22:44] of sacrifice and
[1:22:47] worship had done the
[1:22:49] best but he was not
[1:22:51] accepted but God would go ahead to say
[1:22:55] if you do well won you be accepted so in
[1:22:59] other words there is something that you
[1:23:01] and I must
[1:23:03] do that we do not have to
[1:23:08] do there is something that we must do
[1:23:10] that we don't have to
[1:23:15] do glory to God there is an action that
[1:23:19] must be
[1:23:20] done that we don't have to do by
[1:23:23] ourselves
[1:23:25] there is someone else that has done an
[1:23:29] action on our behalf that we must do by
[1:23:34] accepting what he has
[1:23:37] done
[1:23:39] amen hallelujah amen in the book of Acts
[1:23:42] 16:
[1:23:43] 30 the Bible says and brought them
[1:23:47] out and this is a man you know of the
[1:23:49] prison and he
[1:23:51] said you know s speaking to the apostle
[1:23:55] you know after he saw the what the angel
[1:23:57] of the Lord had
[1:23:58] done open the prison doors and
[1:24:02] everything he had known these men are
[1:24:05] true Servants of God so he say son what
[1:24:09] must I do to be
[1:24:12] saved so you see it appears every human
[1:24:15] being wants to know what they can do to
[1:24:19] be so he wanted to know what must I
[1:24:23] do to saved it's a question that has
[1:24:26] been over the
[1:24:28] ages right from the book of
[1:24:30] Genesis all through the the New
[1:24:34] Testament in the Book of Matthew chapter
[1:24:36] 19 ver 16 he says and behold one came
[1:24:41] and said unto him now this is a person a
[1:24:45] man who came to
[1:24:46] Jesus now God in
[1:24:49] flesh he comes to him and he asks him
[1:24:51] this question good master
[1:24:55] what good
[1:24:56] thing shall I
[1:24:59] do that I may have eternal
[1:25:03] life so it's a repeat a repeated
[1:25:06] question over the
[1:25:11] ages everybody has wanted to know what
[1:25:13] can I do to be
[1:25:16] saved what I what can I do to be
[1:25:19] accepted what can I do to have eternal
[1:25:23] life to receive eternal life is to be
[1:25:27] accepted to receive eternal life is to
[1:25:29] be
[1:25:30] saved to receive eternal life is to be
[1:25:33] accepted in
[1:25:36] Bel but you see this you know prison God
[1:25:40] wanted to do something to attain
[1:25:44] it this you know Master want I mean this
[1:25:48] gentleman here wanted to know the Rich
[1:25:49] Young Ruler he wanted to know what good
[1:25:51] thing he must do to be sa
[1:25:56] but I'm here this evening to remind
[1:25:59] you there is no amount of
[1:26:03] Works amen there is no amount of
[1:26:06] works that we in ourselves can actually
[1:26:10] do to be able to attain this
[1:26:15] salvation there is no amount of works we
[1:26:17] could do
[1:26:20] before right from the days of Adam
[1:26:24] from the very
[1:26:25] beginning right from the very beginning
[1:26:28] When sin came into the world there was
[1:26:31] nothing we could
[1:26:33] do to bring
[1:26:35] Redemption to bring Salvation there was
[1:26:38] nothing we could do Moses had nothing he
[1:26:41] could do Adam had nothing he could do
[1:26:44] Abraham had nothing he could none of
[1:26:47] these Great Men of God had anything they
[1:26:50] could do to redeem the situation
[1:26:54] because remember Adam was
[1:26:56] sinless Adam was perfect Adam was the
[1:27:00] righteousness of
[1:27:02] God Adam was holy Adam was without
[1:27:07] blemish so was
[1:27:09] Eve but when sin came they fell short of
[1:27:13] the glory of
[1:27:15] God and so they needed to be
[1:27:18] redeemed back again to the original
[1:27:21] state but there was nothing that could
[1:27:25] do they and the generations after
[1:27:28] them the Bible says all of us are born
[1:27:31] in
[1:27:33] sin we have all fallen short of the
[1:27:35] glory of
[1:27:37] God there was no human
[1:27:39] being could do
[1:27:42] anything that's why John cried the Bible
[1:27:45] in the Book of
[1:27:47] Revelation he says John WEP John WEP
[1:27:51] because there was no man
[1:27:54] are you listening there was no man that
[1:27:58] was worthy to touch the book or to open
[1:28:02] the book to lose the seals there was no
[1:28:06] man wory but then the voice spoke to him
[1:28:09] he says fear not John there is one who
[1:28:12] is worthy there is one who is worthy and
[1:28:16] that's the
[1:28:17] lamb but he called him he called him the
[1:28:19] lion of the tribe of
[1:28:21] Judah he said he has prevailed
[1:28:25] Amen to take the book and to lose the
[1:28:29] S who is the lion the lion became the
[1:28:34] lamb amen he became a lamb of God he say
[1:28:38] John said
[1:28:40] Behold the Lamb of God takes away the
[1:28:44] sins of the world who is it it is Jesus
[1:28:48] Christ amen that's why he came that's
[1:28:52] why Jesus was born he came to do what no
[1:28:55] man could do he came sister to bring
[1:29:00] Redemption he came to bring things back
[1:29:02] into
[1:29:03] order he came to change
[1:29:06] chaos into order you remember you know
[1:29:11] the Bible says in the
[1:29:12] beginning amen you know God created
[1:29:15] heaven and earth and he says the Earth
[1:29:17] was without form and
[1:29:20] void and the spirit of the Lord
[1:29:24] who over the
[1:29:25] Earth you see I want to show you
[1:29:28] something and then God said let there be
[1:29:32] but before he ever said anything the
[1:29:35] spirit of God was over
[1:29:40] there and that is the same spirit that
[1:29:43] said let there be
[1:29:45] order Let There Be order when Jesus came
[1:29:50] he came to do the same thing he came to
[1:29:53] create a
[1:29:54] again he came to
[1:29:57] redeem the things that were in
[1:30:01] order let me tell you when when man
[1:30:04] sinned he went out of
[1:30:07] order and everything with
[1:30:10] him went out of
[1:30:12] order that's why a lion can eat
[1:30:15] you that's
[1:30:17] why you know you can go out there and a
[1:30:21] snake will bite you that's why you know
[1:30:24] you will you will be scared that's why
[1:30:26] we close our
[1:30:28] houses that's why we have wild animals
[1:30:30] and domestic
[1:30:32] animals that's why we fear certain
[1:30:35] things these days we even have an animal
[1:30:37] We Fear more than any other
[1:30:40] animal it's called a human being if
[1:30:43] you're walking at night and you find
[1:30:45] this human being you will just dark
[1:30:48] somewhere because you don't know what
[1:30:50] will happen he may be a murderer
[1:30:54] be a wit doctor he may be just a night
[1:30:57] dancer so you don't know what will
[1:30:59] happen so you are all
[1:31:02] fearful why nature is groaning there is
[1:31:06] something out of place nature is out of
[1:31:09] place nature is waiting
[1:31:12] for nature is waiting
[1:31:14] for to be redeemed again his original
[1:31:18] estate when man is redeemed everything
[1:31:22] will be redeemed with him animals will
[1:31:24] be Redeemed by the Bible says in the
[1:31:28] Millennium amen the lion will be led by
[1:31:31] a little
[1:31:32] child what will happen have been back
[1:31:36] again to the beginning before
[1:31:40] fall but I tell you what that
[1:31:44] Redemption happened more than 2,000
[1:31:47] years
[1:31:48] ago we are just going through the phases
[1:31:51] of we're just going through the phases
[1:31:55] there are people that were redeemed when
[1:31:58] Jesus came and he died on the cross he
[1:32:02] redeemed me he redeemed you he redeemed
[1:32:05] as many US had the seed of God
[1:32:10] in hallelujah amen my my my my my this I
[1:32:16] tell you your heart up as I was studying
[1:32:19] I called brother Dan I said brother
[1:32:21] Dan this thing
[1:32:24] it is too good to be
[1:32:26] true I told him a few of
[1:32:29] them we just sat there and
[1:32:32] laugh like it sounds too good said will
[1:32:35] the people receive
[1:32:36] it can you receive it
[1:32:39] tonight amen we're just beginning now
[1:32:42] but we the Bible says in the book of
[1:32:45] Isaiah
[1:32:46] 64 verse 6 but we are all as an unclean
[1:32:52] thing talking about us in the Fallen
[1:32:57] condition we were all unclean
[1:33:00] things and all our
[1:33:04] righteous
[1:33:07] as and we all do fed as a
[1:33:13] leaf and our
[1:33:15] iniquities like the
[1:33:17] wind they have taken us
[1:33:20] away sin is inherent
[1:33:25] it is it is in
[1:33:27] us there is another
[1:33:29] law the law of
[1:33:31] sin the law of the flesh it somehow is
[1:33:36] embedded with us and you know our works
[1:33:39] of our works of
[1:33:41] righteousness are as filthy
[1:33:44] rats they cannot be
[1:33:47] accepted now he's talking not talking
[1:33:50] about sins he's talking about the good
[1:33:53] things we can do
[1:33:56] so in other words we remember in the Old
[1:33:59] Testament so in the Old Testament he has
[1:34:02] already rendered all the works the good
[1:34:04] works of
[1:34:07] humankind
[1:34:09] filthy listen think about what you can
[1:34:12] do that is
[1:34:14] good God says it is
[1:34:16] filthy it is as a filthy
[1:34:19] rug you know the rug you used to clean
[1:34:21] the toilet
[1:34:24] that's how your good works
[1:34:26] are think about it brother that's how
[1:34:29] your good works
[1:34:31] are so what amount of Good
[1:34:35] Works can we do that will offer us
[1:34:39] eternal
[1:34:40] life what amount of Good
[1:34:43] Works can we do that will make God
[1:34:47] accept
[1:34:48] us I said none
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:54] none no amount of
[1:34:56] dressing no amount of where you keep
[1:34:58] your
[1:34:59] hair no amount no amount of Good
[1:35:04] Works to avoid what to
[1:35:07] eat to do this to do this that all those
[1:35:11] good
[1:35:12] works in
[1:35:15] themselves canot make us
[1:35:18] holy they cannot redeem
[1:35:21] us because making you holy means you are
[1:35:26] redeemed so if those good works could
[1:35:28] make any man
[1:35:30] redeemed Jesus died in vain but why did
[1:35:34] he die remember he died when all these
[1:35:37] works of the law were
[1:35:41] there this man who was asking him what
[1:35:43] he can
[1:35:44] do he had done all the good works of
[1:35:48] the he had never killed he had never
[1:35:51] lied he had never done anybody
[1:35:54] and now Jesus asked
[1:35:56] him he said go do all those Works he
[1:35:59] said I've done all
[1:36:02] of he said all right there is one more
[1:36:05] that is
[1:36:06] Ling now Jesus did not say don't do the
[1:36:10] work he said do them and I want to
[1:36:13] encourage you tonight do the good
[1:36:16] works do the good
[1:36:19] works hallelujah hallelujah
[1:36:23] the gospel we are
[1:36:25] preaching does not tell us to do bad
[1:36:28] works it tells us to do the good
[1:36:32] works work out your
[1:36:34] salvation with fear and
[1:36:36] tring do the good
[1:36:39] work but then he says after you have
[1:36:42] done all the
[1:36:44] works you are still filthy as filthy as
[1:36:48] every
[1:36:50] seen so then what must you do he said
[1:36:53] there is one more
[1:36:55] thing amen he says go sell everything
[1:36:58] you
[1:36:59] have give to the poor come follow me for
[1:37:03] fate everything give up the whole world
[1:37:07] Amen and follow me the man could not do
[1:37:10] it because the man did not have the most
[1:37:13] expensive thing in the economy of
[1:37:18] God it's called
[1:37:20] Revelation that's what K never had
[1:37:24] that's what this man never
[1:37:26] had that's what many Christians don't
[1:37:29] have they are doing good works but they
[1:37:32] are as Sinners as anyone
[1:37:34] else because they have no
[1:37:37] Revelation in all you're getting get
[1:37:42] Revelation
[1:37:44] amen
[1:37:46] amen hallelujah hallelujah I said
[1:37:49] hallelujah hallelujah in the book of
[1:37:51] Hebrews 11: 6
[1:37:53] he says but without
[1:37:55] faith but without
[1:37:57] faith but our Prophet told us faith is a
[1:38:01] revelation of the will of
[1:38:04] God he say without faith it is
[1:38:09] impossible tell your neighbor is
[1:38:11] impossible to please him for he that
[1:38:14] cometh to
[1:38:16] God must
[1:38:17] believe that God is that he is and he is
[1:38:21] a rewarder
[1:38:24] of them that
[1:38:27] diligently so now without faith you can
[1:38:32] never please
[1:38:33] God without
[1:38:35] Revelation you can never please him how
[1:38:38] do we please God we pleas God by
[1:38:42] spiritual
[1:38:43] Revelation whatever you do it is

[1:38:50] you what AB did revealed to him that was
[1:38:55] the difference between AB

[1:39:03] Revelation AB did what with Revelation
[1:39:07] if you have Revelation are you hearing
[1:39:10] me church if you have Revelation you
[1:39:13] will always do the right
[1:39:15] works you will always do the works that
[1:39:17] will move
[1:39:19] God that woman
[1:39:21] re by revelation by law it was not
[1:39:26] allowed for a woman with a blood issue
[1:39:29] to come people but by
[1:39:32] Revelation this woman said if I die I
[1:39:35] die I have to touch the H of
[1:39:38] his she and touched her and she knew how
[1:39:44] did she know by Revelation if I touch
[1:39:47] him I will be made and she re against
[1:39:52] all works of the Lord
[1:39:55] and she touched him and by faith she was
[1:39:58] healed and I said tonight be healed if
[1:40:02] you do anything by
[1:40:05] faith not by
[1:40:07] sight if you dress your dress by faith
[1:40:11] if you talk well by faith if you behave

[1:40:33] me who I am I am who I am because of who
[1:40:37] he said I am I said I am who I am
[1:40:41] because of who he said I am not because
[1:40:43] of what I thought I did what I thought I
[1:40:46] could
[1:40:47] do but because of who he
[1:40:49] said I

[1:43:07] the amen amen hallelujah
[1:43:11] hallelujah let's look at the
[1:43:14] law what the Lord did in the book of
[1:43:17] Deuteronomy
[1:43:19] 27: 26 cast be he that confir
[1:43:24] not all the words of this L do
[1:43:31] them and all the people shall say
[1:43:35] Amen
[1:43:37] now the law C
[1:43:41] everyone that did not confirm that did
[1:43:44] not do
[1:43:49] all when you don't fulfill all the law
[1:43:53] you are cast so fulfill all of
[1:43:56] it or you are
[1:43:58] cast now let's first leave the blood we
[1:44:03] leave the grace we leave Jesus we leave
[1:44:06] all that we look at the works of the
[1:44:09] Lord how many here can truly say they
[1:44:13] have done everything God wanted them to
[1:44:18] do that you're perfect in all the
[1:44:21] instructions of the word
[1:44:23] can you lift up your
[1:44:25] hands none which means according to the
[1:44:28] law according to the instruction what
[1:44:31] the law is the instructions of
[1:44:33] God the law is Holy because God is Holy
[1:44:38] and the law is from God so the law is
[1:44:40] Holy and God has desired that you be
[1:44:43] holy as he
[1:44:45] is that's why he gave the law but you
[1:44:48] see no one could raise up their
[1:44:50] hand according to the law all of you us
[1:44:54] a
[1:44:55] c is the called the cast of The
[1:44:58] Lord all C why because the law is
[1:45:03] Holy and we in
[1:45:06] ourselves cannot be able to
[1:45:10] fulfill we do not have the
[1:45:14] faculty within us by our in ourselves to
[1:45:19] fulfill the works
[1:45:21] of so all of us
[1:45:24] according to the law we are out
[1:45:27] cast imagine if Christ did
[1:45:31] not if the blood was not
[1:45:35] sh imagine we will all be a bunch of
[1:45:39] C no human could be
[1:45:43] perfect due to that inherent
[1:45:46] sin we needed something better
[1:45:53] for our
[1:45:56] Redemption amen and in the book of
[1:45:58] Galatians
[1:45:59] 3:10 he says for us many are as of the
[1:46:03] works of the law are under the
[1:46:09] curse don't eat that don't do that don't
[1:46:14] speak that don't dress that don't feel
[1:46:17] that don't do that don't listen to that
[1:46:21] don't don't don't don't and as you you
[1:46:24] think you're following all the works of
[1:46:26] the
[1:46:29] Lord truly truly no man
[1:46:33] can here is what we can do in our human
[1:46:37] ability we can fulfill
[1:46:40] some some we
[1:46:42] cannot and that's why we now then go
[1:46:45] under the
[1:46:47] C for it is written cast is everyone
[1:46:52] that continue with not in all things
[1:46:54] which are written in the book of the law
[1:46:56] to do
[1:47:03] them Paul is now quoting
[1:47:08] theonomy but that no man is
[1:47:12] justified by the
[1:47:15] law in the sight of God it is
[1:47:20] evident for the just
[1:47:23] shall live
[1:47:26] by tell your neighbor
[1:47:31] the and the law is not of
[1:47:35] Faith but the man that doeth them shall
[1:47:38] live in
[1:47:41] them I am so glad I'm not just living in
[1:47:44] the works of the
[1:47:46] Lord I am so glad I am living above the
[1:47:51] Lord so glad I am not judged on the
[1:47:55] basis of the works of the
[1:47:58] Lord amen I am judged on the basis of
[1:48:02] what Calvary has
[1:48:06] done amen and that's why I am
[1:48:09] sure I am not pretending I am not
[1:48:13] presuming I am sure I am accepted in
[1:48:18] Beloved amen because I know Calvary it
[1:48:25] all amen amen and the law is not of
[1:48:30] Faith but the man that doth them in
[1:48:34] them Galatians 3:13 say Christ everybody

[1:58:02] place
[1:58:04] hallelujah
[1:58:05] amen now listen in the Book of
[1:58:09] Revelation of Jesus Christ Our Prophet
[1:58:13] says so the things are in the
[1:58:16] message it's not my idea no man knows
[1:58:19] the things of God save the spirit of God
[1:58:25] and he to whom the spirit of God reveals
[1:58:30] them some of us know the things
[1:58:33] of some of us know who we
[1:58:36] are some of us know what
[1:58:38] happen where we came from where we are
[1:58:41] going we know the things of God because
[1:58:45] we have spiritual
[1:58:47] Revelation he has revealed them unto us
[1:58:50] then he came and he was asked why do you
[1:58:53] speak to those people in Parables he
[1:58:56] said unto you it is revealed butto them
[1:59:00] it is not revealed butto you it is
[1:59:03] revealed it is given to know the
[1:59:08] Mysteries unto you it is given unto me
[1:59:11] it is given unto the bride of
[1:59:14] Christ brother Solomon it is given to
[1:59:17] you to
[1:59:19] know amen we need to call on
[1:59:23] God for Revelation more than anything
[1:59:25] else in the
[1:59:29] world we have accepted the
[1:59:32] Bible we have accepted the great truth
[1:59:34] of
[1:59:35] it but it is still not real to most
[1:59:39] people because the Revelation by the
[1:59:42] spirit is not
[1:59:46] there I love the example brother ephra
[1:59:49] gave last Wednesday
[1:59:52] you know he said if if sham writes a
[1:59:56] letter to his
[1:59:58] wife I love you and he sends his name to
[2:00:02] it and then as he some he gives it to
[2:00:04] someone to take
[2:00:05] it and as he's taking it drop it drops
[2:00:10] and someone else speaks it and he reads
[2:00:13] it I love you shame you'll be like
[2:00:16] what's this
[2:00:18] about yeah I love you yeah you throw
[2:00:22] down but when fa picks
[2:00:26] it I love you she will read between the
[2:00:29] lines he's now meaning this he's now
[2:00:33] meaning this he will see what is not
[2:00:35] even written she will understand beyond
[2:00:38] the
[2:00:39] letter the bride understands beyond what
[2:00:42] is
[2:00:44] written the bride reads it and she
[2:00:48] understands and reads between the lines
[2:00:52] amen amen the word has not been
[2:00:54] quickened to
[2:00:55] them the Bible says in 2 Corinthians
[2:00:59] 5:21 we have become the righteousness of
[2:01:04] God by our Union with Jesus
[2:01:08] Christ he asks a question did you get it
[2:01:11] it says that we are we are the very
[2:01:15] righteousness of God himself
[2:01:22] by being in
[2:01:25] Christ it says that he
[2:01:27] Jesus became
[2:01:29] sin for us it does not say he became
[2:01:35] sinful but he became sin for us that by
[2:01:38] our Union with
[2:01:40] him we may become the righteous
[2:01:43] of if we accept the
[2:01:47] fact if we accept the fact and we must
[2:01:50] that he literally became sinful for
[2:01:56] us then we must also accept the fact
[2:02:00] that we by our Union with
[2:02:04] him we have
[2:02:07] become I don't have enough voice to
[2:02:10] shout that we have
[2:02:12] become the very righteousness of God
[2:02:22] imagine that our Prophet says if you
[2:02:26] accept that he became
[2:02:28] sin for you then you must
[2:02:32] accept the first is a
[2:02:34] fact he became sin it is a fact it is
[2:02:39] also a fact we have
[2:02:42] become the right of God it is a fact
[2:02:47] whether you feel it or not whether you
[2:02:49] see it or not Hallelujah
[2:02:52] it is a I am the
[2:02:56] righte I don't care what you see I don't
[2:02:59] care what you let me tell you what he
[2:03:02] said I am the righte of God Christ
[2:03:06] Hallelujah I am the right of God the
[2:03:09] devil has nothing to do
[2:03:12] about amen in Christ I
[2:03:16] am it say that he
[2:03:18] Jesus became sin for us
[2:03:22] hallelujah amen to reject one is to
[2:03:24] reject the
[2:03:26] other to accept the one is to accept the
[2:03:29] other now we know the Bible says
[2:03:32] that it can't be
[2:03:35] denied but the revelation of it is
[2:03:39] missing to many people it is not real to
[2:03:42] the majority of God's
[2:03:46] children may it become real to
[2:03:48] you stop always thinking about what you
[2:03:51] did
[2:03:54] do salvation is beyond your
[2:03:58] works it is beyond what you've done it
[2:04:01] is beyond what you doing beyond what you
[2:04:04] will do when he chust me in he knew what
[2:04:08] I will do in my past present future but
[2:04:12] he still CH me and he CH me perect
[2:04:17] him nothing I do nothing in my P
[2:04:22] can change my
[2:04:27] identity it is just as a good verse in
[2:04:29] the Bible but we need to have it made
[2:04:31] alive to
[2:04:35] us hallelujah amen that is what we
[2:04:39] are I am so glad that is revealed to me
[2:04:45] I am so glad the devil cannot deceive me
[2:04:48] I know who I am
[2:04:51] amen listen to this devil I know I've
[2:04:54] done many wrong things in the
[2:04:56] past that did not change my
[2:04:59] AG devil will say maybe tomorrow you
[2:05:03] will do something and I'll cat You by
[2:05:06] that even by that I am not
[2:05:10] identified I am
[2:05:13] identified in what he
[2:05:15] is what I am in
[2:05:18] him I am already accepted
[2:05:22] he accepted me in
[2:05:26] Christ
