[46:04] Zambia and he wanted to know whether we
[46:07] had a service on Friday so that he can
[46:09] also come and be a blessing to us
[46:14] here so I told him unfortunately this
[46:17] Friday we don't have a
[46:21] service and I told him about our home
[46:25] Cale program that we have
[46:30] on on Friday we supposed to be doing the
[46:35] cell and also Brother Martin was
[46:38] supposed to minister
[46:40] in Miana
[46:44] Road and um so I thought should we just
[46:48] have the guest you know come to benefit
[46:51] only those of us who will be in in that
[46:54] area
[46:59] I felt we would be
[47:03] selfish so uh we there decided to invite
[47:08] everyone who can be able to make it to
[47:10] church this
[47:14] evening to come and be a part of that
[47:19] blessing isn't that
[47:22] wonderful and
[47:25] um he you the minister was supposed to
[47:28] begin ministering about 30 minutes
[47:33] ago but I was informed by uh Pastor Jess
[47:37] they caught up in
[47:41] traffic but I should be here any time
[47:44] from
[47:46] now
[47:49] amen um God bless you for your
[47:53] sacrifice to just um you know leave
[47:57] whatever that you are going to do to be
[47:59] in the presence of God this
[48:04] evening I believe that that the Lord
[48:06] will bless
[48:09] you
[48:11] amen so we will just um sing a few songs
[48:14] and maybe go in prayer a little bit as
[48:16] we I I have a few prayer requests I want
[48:19] to give
[48:23] you so that while we wait for the
[48:25] minister
[48:28] we can be able to pray over those
[48:32] things uh I know there most of our
[48:35] brothers and sisters that are not here
[48:37] are streaming online stream
[48:40] [Music]
[48:44] online and so uh today I had
[48:48] communication with Bethany High School I
[48:51] have good news and bad news
[48:57] high
[48:58] school and so Bethany told me okay we're
[49:02] waiting because we we had communication
[49:04] we're writing each
[49:08] other and uh regarding our youth
[49:13] come and
[49:15] so um the last communication we had was
[49:19] we were requesting we were agreeing to
[49:21] their terms and we are requesting them
[49:22] to tell us the names to which we shall
[49:25] write the check
[49:38] yes because they wanted us to make at
[49:40] least a 50%
[49:44] payment so I waited Monday no response
[49:48] Tuesday
[49:50] Wednesday so today I said let me let me
[49:53] call the school
[49:56] find out why they have not responded to
[50:00] us and uh this gentleman tells me oh you
[50:03] didn't receive the letter
[50:05] Pastor I said no we did not re said no
[50:09] the teacher wrote a
[50:12] letter and asked the receptionist to get
[50:14] in touch with the
[50:19] church and so we thought you had
[50:21] received
[50:23] it so he said but anyways I'll take you
[50:27] through I'll brief
[50:31] you then they say well our school um is
[50:35] in some kind of
[50:38] agreement they have they in a contract
[50:41] agreement
[50:44] [Music]
[50:46] with for I think a number of
[50:50] years to be doing to be for to be
[50:53] marking from their school
[50:58] and and so he said we did not receive
[51:02] communication from
[51:04] you
[51:08] year and we certainly thought they're
[51:10] not
[51:12] coming but even if they were coming we
[51:14] thought they will mark up to maybe
[51:17] November 7th I mean January
[51:24] 7th that was our expectation
[51:28] they and uh
[51:31] so but inally they're telling us they'll
[51:33] be marking up to 18th
[51:39] January and so I was told I'm sorry
[51:44] Pastor you cannot have your event and
[51:47] also have uh your nebor at the same
[51:54] school I told them come on you can't
[51:58] mean that on the last
[52:01] minute this is a big
[52:04] event they said but we are in a contract
[52:07] with
[52:08] you we did not mean to disappoint
[52:13] you uh but it is just something that is
[52:16] beyond
[52:18] us and we are sorry but we cannot host
[52:20] you this
[52:23] year I felt the way you are feeling now
[52:28] but I spoke with my
[52:30] wife and um at that
[52:34] moment um I um prayed in my
[52:39] heart and the Lord spoke to
[52:42] me uh and put a specific place in my
[52:48] heart that I should go check out
[52:51] immediately so I called Brother
[52:54] Martin I told him Brother Martin
[52:58] I gave him the information that I've
[52:59] given
[53:00] you and I said so this is what is
[53:04] happening
[53:06] um we don't he felt bad of
[53:09] course
[53:10] uh and I can hear everybody
[53:14] silent that's how myself and brother
[53:17] martin
[53:20] were uh but then I told him there is
[53:22] this place that the Lord has placed in
[53:24] my heart
[53:27] as soon as I received the
[53:31] news uh I'd like us to go check it
[53:34] out uh before we check out other
[53:38] places because the PDN the one we had
[53:41] this
[53:43] year it is presumed that another church
[53:47] will be doing their camp this year
[53:50] there
[53:53] year probably around the same dates
[53:58] so I went with Brother Martin to that
[54:01] place that the Lord had laid on my
[54:04] heart and um probably many of you know
[54:09] it uh we will announce it as soon as we
[54:13] we have concluded if there are anything
[54:15] to conclude with
[54:19] them
[54:21] so when we reached there when we arrived
[54:24] there the this man the gentleman is a
[54:30] professor they the one in charge of the
[54:33] of the whole
[54:36] facility he was he looked as if he had
[54:39] met us
[54:41] before he was so
[54:43] excited oh you're
[54:46] welcome and I had my heart with a round
[54:53] cap and so when I was greeting him I
[54:56] remove
[54:57] it he said Oh I thought you were a very
[54:59] old
[55:01] man I said I'm old in my room my
[55:06] [Music]
[55:07] right well he said okay you're welcome
[55:11] so we went in his office and he was very
[55:14] happy and very
[55:17] receptive how can I help you so we
[55:19] talked about what we want
[55:21] help it's um an institution
[55:29] so we we told him what we were we're
[55:33] planning a youth camp and blah blah blah
[55:35] these
[55:36] [Music]
[55:38] days do you have enough
[55:41] facilities he said let me take you
[55:44] around and uh so he was just very happy
[55:46] I mean I was
[55:48] impressed so uh so he took us around so
[55:52] when we saw the hall the first place we
[55:54] saw
[55:57] I even wondered why we had not seen that
[56:01] place being so close to
[56:05] us um almost in the same distance like
[56:11] Bethany this
[56:13] side so um we you know he showed us the
[56:18] hall the hall h is big and more
[56:23] beautiful than even Bethany
[56:26] and uh so we we took us to the
[56:30] hostels very good very well
[56:34] established took us the
[56:36] kitchen and um they said the chairs we
[56:40] have even tens of
[56:45] thousands um
[56:48] screens you know wey talking about
[56:50] brothers bringing their screens and
[56:54] things he said we have
[56:58] plenty huge
[57:00] screen is a a technological
[57:05] Institute so we were so
[57:10] impressed um and so we went and sat down
[57:14] with him in the
[57:17] office and uh he said so
[57:20] gentlemen how much would you like to
[57:22] offer
[57:24] us each of the days you going to be
[57:28] here so we told him you tell us how much
[57:32] would you want us to
[57:36] pay well he said you're going to be here
[57:38] for three
[57:41] nights he said tell us he said tell us
[57:46] tell me how much would you like to
[57:51] pay you already
[57:54] welcome we have given you the place
[57:58] um so just tell us how much you want to
[58:01] pay and I mean the whole thing did not
[58:03] look so
[58:06] real it was so
[58:08] fast and and so we told I looked at B
[58:12] Martin I told him they asked us about 9
[58:15] million
[58:18] something so we counted how much a day
[58:21] million a day okay so let's tell him 1
[58:25] million a day
[58:29] Brother Martin told
[58:31] me that is so
[58:33] little she may not
[58:36] accept so he said uh I said okay maybe
[58:40] if if it is 1.5 okay fine but let us
[58:43] begin uh I told him let's begin with a
[58:46] small
[58:50] amount um I I so he said okay so
[58:53] gentlemen how much will it be
[58:56] uh have you thought about it I told him
[58:59] yes we want to pay 1 million a
[59:04] day and I was very
[59:07] serious he said that's a good
[59:09] offer 3 million that's a good
[59:12] offer it's a good
[59:14] offer but how about you add 1
[59:21] million and uh you make it four Millions
[59:25] [Music]
[59:27] overall and we give you all these
[59:30] facilities for the three
[59:36] days we did not
[59:40] answer because it sounded so
[59:44] unreal and I'm speaking it here
[59:46] publicly because I want us to
[59:49] pray God is up to
[59:52] something the devil is up to something
[59:56] but God is up to
[59:57] something God always beats the devil at
[1:00:00] his own
[1:00:03] game when the devil thought he had
[1:00:07] won that's when God shows her and he
[1:00:11] proves I'm in this I'm on your side and
[1:00:16] so this
[1:00:18] gentleman so we kept quiet as in
[1:00:23] approval and then we uh he said well
[1:00:26] write a
[1:00:27] letter address it to our
[1:00:30] institution and from your
[1:00:33] church
[1:00:35] request uh for for you to come and use
[1:00:39] our
[1:00:41] facility and so we will consider
[1:00:45] it uh I told him you will have the
[1:00:48] letter as soon as
[1:00:51] tomorrow and the only down on that place
[1:00:55] is the is the um air
[1:01:00] conditioning but he said the room the
[1:01:02] hole is so
[1:01:04] large you don't
[1:01:06] need we told him we need it so he said
[1:01:09] I'll talk with the directors and we
[1:01:12] see we see whether we can do
[1:01:16] something
[1:01:18] friends if this turns out to be the
[1:01:21] place we shall use
[1:01:26] already on our
[1:01:27] budget it means God has already paid for
[1:01:31] us 5
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:36] million because you remember we we had a
[1:01:38] budget of 35
[1:01:41] 37 and we made an average of 35
[1:01:47] million we pledged the the the the
[1:01:50] committee the committee of the brothers
[1:01:53] the organizing committee PL
[1:01:56] 5.5
[1:01:58] million and um last Sunday the church
[1:02:01] pledged 1 I think
[1:02:05] 45 so we were remaining with about is it
[1:02:08] 13
[1:02:09] million if the math is
[1:02:12] correct so so that without knowing where
[1:02:15] it will come
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:18] from where the 13 million because that
[1:02:21] is remaining it's
[1:02:24] unpledged and know where it will come
[1:02:26] from but if they have if they have
[1:02:29] declined us to use this
[1:02:33] place and God has opened a door for that
[1:02:36] new
[1:02:37] place at that
[1:02:39] amount a better place at that amount it
[1:02:44] means already the budget has reduced by
[1:02:47] 5
[1:02:51] million so that's why I'm asking you
[1:02:53] that we should pray
[1:02:56] sometimes when God does things you may
[1:02:58] ask God for something and God may turn
[1:03:00] it
[1:03:02] down and then you think God has forsaken
[1:03:06] you but you see when the devil thinks he
[1:03:09] has
[1:03:11] won that moment is when God shows
[1:03:14] her and he does something that you even
[1:03:17] never
[1:03:18] imagine something that you even never
[1:03:21] thought
[1:03:22] of and friends I want to tell you I
[1:03:25] believe God is in
[1:03:28] this God is with
[1:03:30] us uh this burden came from the
[1:03:34] Lord and He will
[1:03:36] supply both the venue the perfect venue
[1:03:39] for
[1:03:40] us and the money that we
[1:03:44] need and even the ministers that are
[1:03:46] going to come to
[1:03:48] minister uh we believe that God will uh
[1:03:52] God has already orchestrated everything
[1:03:56] plann it all
[1:03:57] out and our way is not his
[1:04:01] way but his way is
[1:04:03] perfect as long as we know we are we are
[1:04:07] standing on behind his
[1:04:11] vision then he is standing behind with
[1:04:15] us and he's behind whatever we are
[1:04:18] doing and so we should
[1:04:20] pray and believe that the Lord is with
[1:04:24] us
[1:04:26] Sister Jesse we happy to see
[1:04:28] you God bless you and uh you you came in
[1:04:32] late but I just mentioned I don't know
[1:04:34] whether you were following online were
[1:04:35] you no so we're just saying that Bethany
[1:04:38] they saying your neb is going to be
[1:04:39] marking from
[1:04:43] there and then here we get a better
[1:04:47] place
[1:04:48] just for even 5 million is
[1:04:53] cheaper I say God is with us and he will
[1:04:57] sustain us through
[1:04:59] all so let us

[1:05:04] would like us to pray for this Youth

[1:22:29] good as the Pastor said pastor
[1:22:33] Jess may God bless
[1:22:35] him he's such a wonderful servant of
[1:22:38] God I shared with him the puppet inam as
[1:22:42] he
[1:22:45] said and from there I was on my way to
[1:22:50] Uganda but I only reached
[1:22:59] now on my way
[1:23:00] back I met his sonin-law
[1:23:06] from the pastor in
[1:23:10] Nairobi and from that time we have been
[1:23:14] interacting then I F the
[1:23:18] pool because my heart is for the lost
[1:23:21] soul especially reaching out in the
[1:23:25] areas so I F the
[1:23:28] pool to
[1:23:30] visit so when I was
[1:23:33] coming I said I cannot just go to
[1:23:35] without seeing
[1:23:38] P so that's how I came to him

[1:23:45] back may God bless the servant of
[1:23:49] God of God have opened the door to
[1:23:53] preach puet is something that we must
[1:23:56] regard
[1:23:58] Jal because it's from here where you can
[1:24:01] kill the church or build the
[1:24:04] church so may God bless you to open the
[1:24:08] door but I pray according to the grace I
[1:24:13] will not disappoint you God bless
[1:24:16] you let's go straight into the word of
[1:24:20] God Matthew Chapter 7
[1:24:24] [Music]
[1:24:27] uh we'll start reading from verse
[1:24:31] 21 then go through up to
[1:24:37] 23 the Bible
[1:24:39] reads not everyone that say unto me Lord
[1:24:43] Lord shall enter into the kingdom of
[1:24:45] heaven but he that doth the will of the
[1:24:48] My Father which is in heaven many will
[1:24:51] say unto me in the day Lord Lord have we
[1:24:55] not prophesy in thy name and in thy name
[1:24:58] have cast out devils and in thy name
[1:25:00] done many wonderful works and then will
[1:25:03] I profess unto them I never knew you
[1:25:06] depart from me ye workers of iniquity m
[1:25:47] may the Lord are the blessing to the
[1:25:48] leading of his
[1:25:51] word you may be SE
[1:25:55] um I want to share with the sense of the
[1:25:57] Living
[1:25:59] God on the message I've
[1:26:03] entitled doing the will of
[1:26:07] God doing the will of
[1:26:10] God many of the
[1:26:13] times people tend to
[1:26:17] misunderstand sometimes fail to Define
[1:26:20] what the will of God is
[1:26:24] even me I've been there for some
[1:26:28] time every time when somebody ask
[1:26:31] me are you doing the will of
[1:26:34] God and to my own
[1:26:36] understanding and this is the general
[1:26:39] understanding the religion
[1:26:41] C what always comes to the mind of a
[1:26:45] Believer or a
[1:26:49] worshiper doing the will of
[1:26:51] God they say is to praise God
[1:26:56] to do good things to be kind to
[1:26:59] people to serve
[1:27:02] God and all good thing that you
[1:27:05] know and that's what people
[1:27:08] know but one day when I was going
[1:27:11] through the
[1:27:12] scripture when the Lord Jesus said many
[1:27:15] on that
[1:27:18] day many not few but many
[1:27:24] who come to
[1:27:25] him did we not do this and
[1:27:29] that I was a good man Lord I helped the
[1:27:34] needy I helped my neighbor I did this
[1:27:37] and
[1:27:38] that Hallelujah and that's what people
[1:27:42] think it is the will of God but I want
[1:27:45] to tell you sense of the Living God
[1:27:48] being good is not a
[1:27:52] qualification for you
[1:27:54] to enter the kingdom
[1:27:57] of Hallelujah Hallelujah and God is not
[1:28:02] interested for people to become
[1:28:06] good this is what religion has
[1:28:11] done many
[1:28:13] people millions of people to become good
[1:28:18] people yet they are not doing the will
[1:28:21] of God
[1:28:27] yes many people and one day I shocked
[1:28:31] the Saints
[1:28:34] in that I've ceased myself to call a
[1:28:39] Believer I've stopped calling myself to
[1:28:42] be a
[1:28:44] believer then the old church was
[1:28:47] silent hallelujah hallelujah yes I don't
[1:28:50] call myself to be a
[1:28:52] believer because even the is a
[1:28:55] Believer do you know that the scripture
[1:28:58] tells
[1:29:00] me if you say you believe
[1:29:03] you but the devil also is a
[1:29:07] Believer I prer myself to be a
[1:29:12] Christian because
[1:29:14] believer they make you to become a
[1:29:17] religious
[1:29:19] person all
[1:29:22] believers if you are not care
[1:29:25] you find
[1:29:27] yourself into the group of
[1:29:30] religion and God is not interested in
[1:29:33] ReliOn God is interested in the sons and
[1:29:42] daughters
[1:29:44] so uh I want to talk about the will of
[1:29:48] God what is the will of
[1:29:52] God what is the will of of God the
[1:29:55] prophet one time preached on the
[1:29:58] message that is possible to serve God
[1:30:00] outside the will of
[1:30:05] God very
[1:30:07] possible and you may be very
[1:30:10] sincere and you must be sincerely have a
[1:30:13] good
[1:30:15] testimony such that even the neighbors
[1:30:18] they able to say this person is a good
[1:30:22] man this person is a good
[1:30:25] truly is a
[1:30:28] Christian you have all those
[1:30:32] qualities you are not a daughter of Son
[1:30:35] of
[1:30:40] God so should we stop doing good
[1:30:43] things no but we should not look on
[1:30:47] those
[1:30:48] things because good
[1:30:50] things should be just a nature
[1:30:55] of a good of of a child of
[1:30:59] God should not be the thing that we must
[1:31:02] begin to
[1:31:03] [Music]
[1:31:05] possess that's what religion has
[1:31:08] done they force people to begin to
[1:31:11] possess good
[1:31:13] things we should never begin to possess
[1:31:16] good
[1:31:18] things we must produce good things
[1:31:24] possessing good
[1:31:27] things and the only thing that can make
[1:31:29] you and me to produce good
[1:31:34] things to know the will of the
[1:31:41] father hallelujah hallelujah the Lord
[1:31:44] Jesus Christ here is telling not anyone
[1:31:47] that say Lord Lord enter the kingdom of
[1:31:51] God
[1:31:55] but those that do the will of the
[1:31:59] father and he went on saying many will
[1:32:02] say to me that
[1:32:05] day which day the day of
[1:32:09] judgment hallelujah hallelujah that day
[1:32:12] many people will
[1:32:14] say and these many
[1:32:17] people our religion people our religious
[1:32:21] people our worshippers
[1:32:24] people who have invested so many
[1:32:26] things they have invested their time
[1:32:30] they have invested their money will
[1:32:33] sacrifice
[1:32:34] everything in the name of worshiping
[1:32:37] God expecting to enter into kingdom of
[1:32:42] God I want to tell you people who don't
[1:32:45] who are not
[1:32:47] believers they know where they
[1:32:49] going and they will not come to complain
[1:32:52] to God
[1:32:55] people who come to complain to
[1:32:57] God you and me if we fail to know the
[1:33:01] will of
[1:33:05] God if you fail to know the will of
[1:33:09] God this is why I am a firm
[1:33:13] believer in
[1:33:16] Miracles because I believe in the
[1:33:18] manifestation of the power of
[1:33:21] God but this does not give me
[1:33:27] plight to be the child of
[1:33:30] God because even just on the
[1:33:34] disciples when he sent them they went
[1:33:37] there and perform signs and
[1:33:39] wonders and they became very they became
[1:33:41] back
[1:33:43] excited then he said don't be happy
[1:33:46] because demon has submitting to you but
[1:33:50] be happy when your names are written the
[1:33:54] book
[1:33:59] of and for your name and my name to be
[1:34:01] written in the book of
[1:34:04] life is not until we
[1:34:07] know and
[1:34:09] do his
[1:34:13] will hallelujah hallelujah you know many
[1:34:17] uh denomination
[1:34:20] people they believe much in good things
[1:34:25] and when the Lord revealed to me to come
[1:34:28] and understand the will of
[1:34:30] God unless God inspires
[1:34:33] me very I preach about evil
[1:34:39] things very I tell people to stop
[1:34:44] drinking very I tell people to condemn
[1:34:48] what they
[1:34:51] do because I came to realize
[1:34:55] that doing so is to make hips of
[1:34:59] religious
[1:35:05] people when somebody know the will of
[1:35:08] God
[1:35:11] tomatically all those evil attributes
[1:35:13] and acts will
[1:35:20] stop God created man on his own
[1:35:25] image and he wants man to live eternal
[1:35:30] life but sin came in and this is why job
[1:35:34] came out
[1:35:37] strongly that any man born of a
[1:35:42] woman as few
[1:35:44] days so let me tell you this becoming a
[1:35:48] good
[1:35:50] person does not save you from being a
[1:35:53] sinner
[1:35:57] you can be good
[1:35:59] person but remain
[1:36:05] a and go to
[1:36:08] hell with good
[1:36:10] testimonies with good
[1:36:13] goodness with all your
[1:36:16] kindness so you become a good
[1:36:21] sinner going to was a good
[1:36:27] sinner Hallelujah why because you felt
[1:36:31] to
[1:36:33] understand and do the will of the
[1:36:37] Father the will of God I always tell
[1:36:41] people it's very
[1:36:44] simple there are not many things as many
[1:36:48] religious people they call
[1:36:51] them do the will of the father that's
[1:36:54] why God says the will of the
[1:36:58] Father the will of the Father the will
[1:37:01] of God is for you and me who was born of
[1:37:06] a
[1:37:07] woman born a
[1:37:09] sinner must come to a place where we
[1:37:13] must be born
[1:37:18] again hallelujah hallelujah we must come
[1:37:21] to a place where we must be born again
[1:37:25] and one thing that the devil has
[1:37:27] donee to the message of the
[1:37:30] hour the devil has made us to become
[1:37:34] limited because we have the Revelation
[1:37:36] that Jesus is
[1:37:38] God and we have the true
[1:37:42] baptism and we have the true
[1:37:44] message and we end there that it's
[1:37:48] okay as we are believers we are not like
[1:37:51] denominations
[1:37:53] like other churches as we have the truth
[1:37:57] I have received the true
[1:37:59] [Music]
[1:38:02] baptism my sister my brother you just
[1:38:06] become a good
[1:38:09] person and it to be
[1:38:12] painful this is why the Bible says they
[1:38:14] IGN death and cry and
[1:38:17] weep they we gr
[1:38:20] tee you know why spend after spending
[1:38:24] all your
[1:38:25] life some of you were born in the family
[1:38:28] of
[1:38:29] Believers you grew up in the
[1:38:32] message and you spend all
[1:38:36] your denying the old
[1:38:39] things and in your heart you conclude
[1:38:42] that I am a
[1:38:45] believer yet not born
[1:38:51] again yet not born again
[1:38:57] Hallelujah because I I don't I don't
[1:39:01] believe if we can tell a born
[1:39:06] again if we can force a born
[1:39:10] again to do the good
[1:39:12] things I don't think
[1:39:17] so because I posted a question one day
[1:39:20] to the
[1:39:21] church that who teach te say a cheek to
[1:39:24] scratch on the
[1:39:28] ground who teaches the cheek to
[1:39:33] scratch they answered me that it is the
[1:39:36] the
[1:39:38] mother I told them that no what about
[1:39:41] those
[1:39:44] Brothers take them without
[1:39:47] mothering that all day we find
[1:39:51] that then they were quiet
[1:39:55] let me tell you it's the nature of a
[1:40:03] chicken the reason why people
[1:40:08] sing because they were born of a
[1:40:11] man and everyone who is born of a
[1:40:14] man is born of adamic
[1:40:18] Nature and the nature of Adam is the
[1:40:21] nature of sin
[1:40:24] whether you are a good person or
[1:40:27] not you still remain a
[1:40:31] sinner
[1:40:33] yes you are just a good
[1:40:36] sinner that does not qualify you to
[1:40:39] become the child of
[1:40:41] God this is why Jesus told
[1:40:44] Nicodemus I tell you the truth unless
[1:40:47] one is born
[1:40:49] again canot see the kingdom of God
[1:40:56] so the will of the father is for
[1:40:59] everyone to be born
[1:41:04] again
[1:41:06] Hallelujah because the message of Born
[1:41:10] Again
[1:41:12] has
[1:41:15] pressed the Pentecostal of misused
[1:41:20] it and the end time
[1:41:23] we have not understood it fully we think
[1:41:26] that when we believe and we got the true
[1:41:30] baptism and we have the message we
[1:41:33] believe in the prophets and we think
[1:41:35] that it's
[1:41:36] okay this is why we have Bunches of
[1:41:40] traditional Church in
[1:41:41] [Music]
[1:41:43] the that's why we have the dead
[1:41:46] churches claing to have the truth but
[1:41:48] there's no life of
[1:41:50] God this why find that they diving each
[1:41:54] other fighting one
[1:41:56] another because they look to each
[1:41:58] other's
[1:42:02] enemies why because they still
[1:42:06] can because the works of the flesh are
[1:42:11] manifested yes you may not commit you
[1:42:13] may not
[1:42:14] steal but you may have a
[1:42:21] threat Hallelujah not still may not
[1:42:24] commit doubt all
[1:42:26] things but the flesh is still in you you
[1:42:31] will still be feel bit
[1:42:34] [Music]
[1:42:38] against one time I was in the
[1:42:40] ministerial
[1:42:42] meeting and I was talking about the
[1:42:44] stature of the perfect
[1:42:47] man and the prophet there outlined
[1:42:55] and there were brotherly kindness
[1:42:56] brother
[1:42:58] love and the love of God but I want to
[1:43:02] tell you brother love it's
[1:43:05] okay but it's not
[1:43:09] perfect brotherly love is so good but
[1:43:12] it's not
[1:43:14] perfect the only perfect
[1:43:18] love
[1:43:20] love because AAP love
[1:43:24] has no limit no
[1:43:27] condition I told them that at
[1:43:31] Brothers if you cannot love me as your
[1:43:35] brother if you say you are children of
[1:43:38] God just love me as your
[1:43:41] enemy because the Bible tells me
[1:43:45] so you
[1:43:47] have you have
[1:43:49] wa love your neighbor
[1:43:53] your
[1:43:55] enemies but I tell you love your enemies
[1:43:59] pray for your enemies when the enemy
[1:44:01] come and ask something from
[1:44:04] you that is
[1:44:07] a so if you cannot love me as your
[1:44:11] brother love me as your enemy then you
[1:44:14] prove to me that you are the
[1:44:19] son amen
[1:44:25] now to
[1:44:26] love is on
[1:44:28] those who are in the will
[1:44:32] of those who are born
[1:44:37] of to have the love of
[1:44:41] God my brother my
[1:44:44] sister my fellow
[1:44:46] servants we can teach the church to love
[1:44:48] one
[1:44:50] another they will never have the perfect
[1:44:52] love
[1:44:54] not until people are born of
[1:44:57] God then they are going to have the
[1:44:59] nature of God in
[1:45:02] them because Love Is
[1:45:09] God and if you don't have
[1:45:12] God you just
[1:45:14] pretend that you love your sister you
[1:45:16] love
[1:45:17] your but inside you the flesh is hitting
[1:45:22] you up
[1:45:26] because you are
[1:45:28] still because in you there's no nature
[1:45:30] of
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:37] God to be born
[1:45:42] again
[1:45:44] Nicodemus turn to Jesus how could it be
[1:45:48] me I'm an old person should I go back to
[1:45:51] my mother's born again
[1:45:53] he said no no no no I'm telling you
[1:45:57] unless one is born
[1:45:59] over of the
[1:46:03] spirit so having a true
[1:46:06] baptism
[1:46:08] in does not qualify
[1:46:10] you to be a child of God that is just
[1:46:14] one
[1:46:19] step it's just a
[1:46:21] step you must go through all the
[1:46:25] processes the prophet preached in the
[1:46:27] message of birth
[1:46:29] pain he explains how bir in
[1:46:37] natural and he Mak it a comparative to
[1:46:40] the
[1:46:42] spiritual and he said that any
[1:46:47] B is a
[1:46:50] Mery to be born again is a
[1:46:58] today we have Smart
[1:47:02] Believers smart
[1:47:05] Believers civilized
[1:47:08] Believers when they are coming before
[1:47:10] the presence of
[1:47:11] God they are saying Lord forgive me you
[1:47:15] know what I've
[1:47:16] done you are so
[1:47:18] merciful Forgive Me Lord
[1:47:24] but I want to tell
[1:47:27] you is a
[1:47:30] [Applause]
[1:47:31] Mery
[1:47:34] hallu you must expose
[1:47:41] yourself Hallelujah we must expose
[1:47:46] ourselves let me tell you yes we are in
[1:47:50] this
[1:47:51] body do you know why came by
[1:47:54] religion
[1:47:58] CLS this is a type of
[1:48:02] religion God did not created man with
[1:48:07] CRS so when you are coming to
[1:48:10] God EMP
[1:48:13] yourself before
[1:48:15] God every secret that you
[1:48:18] have this is why pastors we don't see
[1:48:21] people receiving the Holy
[1:48:23] Ghost because the Holy Ghost knows us
[1:48:28] better you may cry feel me Lord but I
[1:48:33] tell you what ERS many
[1:48:37] Believers from receiving the Holy Ghost
[1:48:40] is UNC confessed
[1:48:43] sin they have become
[1:48:46] religion covering themselves
[1:48:54] my brother my
[1:48:55] sister is
[1:49:03] a hallelujah hallelujah that's why when
[1:49:07] you see the P of
[1:49:10] God the process of God for people to be
[1:49:13] born
[1:49:14] again alus did not go deep in detail to
[1:49:20] explain but the apostles expl explain it
[1:49:24] details Peter on the day of
[1:49:27] Pentecost it them that he
[1:49:30] repent what comes first before what
[1:49:33] baptism is
[1:49:36] repentance then be
[1:49:39] baptized in the name of the Lord
[1:49:41] Jesus every one of you for what for
[1:49:46] remission of your
[1:49:48] sins then you shall receive
[1:49:53] the gift of the Holy
[1:49:57] Ghost repentance genuine
[1:50:00] repentance exposing all the
[1:50:03] secrets whatever sin that you have
[1:50:06] committed in the priv you expose them
[1:50:10] then you receive the
[1:50:13] baptism then you a
[1:50:15] c receive the Holy Ghost
[1:50:22] H when you receive the Holy
[1:50:25] Ghost you are born
[1:50:30] again hallelujah
[1:50:33] hallelujah the prophet said there must
[1:50:36] be
[1:50:39] justification
[1:50:41] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[1:50:44] Ghost and he typed it to the
[1:50:49] Natural in LA
[1:50:52] comes first is
[1:50:54] water
[1:50:56] blood
[1:50:57] then a
[1:50:59] child
[1:51:04] life so the life of
[1:51:08] God only
[1:51:10] come upon a
[1:51:12] Believer who has genuinely
[1:51:16] repented expose all the
[1:51:19] secrets not say Lord you know
[1:51:24] yes he knows but he want you to
[1:51:29] expose look one day are you telling that
[1:51:33] Jesus CH did not
[1:51:36] know because he was
[1:51:39] God he has the
[1:51:42] discernment that woman who
[1:51:45] touched if he wanted going to point her
[1:51:49] there but he wanted her to come out
[1:51:55] and
[1:52:00] confess she said immediately when I
[1:52:03] touched your Closs my issue was stopped
[1:52:07] meaning she was healed but
[1:52:13] not but not but when Jus came
[1:52:16] out she said daughter your faith has
[1:52:20] made you whole
[1:52:24] not your faith has healed
[1:52:27] you but has made
[1:52:31] you let me tell you my brother my sister
[1:52:35] being healed and being completely
[1:52:38] whole two different
[1:52:41] things let me show let me
[1:52:44] demonstrate being healed you have the H
[1:52:48] here then when it is healed it will
[1:52:51] leave a m
[1:52:53] but being
[1:52:55] whole
[1:52:59] disappears being all the mar
[1:53:03] disappears this is why God says you you
[1:53:08] make you as if you have never
[1:53:11] seen because he has made
[1:53:15] you you have not just become a religious
[1:53:18] person you have become a child of God
[1:53:22] Bible tells me so that we know whoever
[1:53:27] born of
[1:53:28] God not because the evil one touches him
[1:53:38] not why because all Sons and Daughters
[1:53:41] of
[1:53:42] God are truly Born
[1:53:45] Again are
[1:53:52] I
[1:53:57] made this is why it's very possible many
[1:54:01] people will
[1:54:03] come because they have never been there
[1:54:07] they have never been born again they
[1:54:09] have never been born of God they they
[1:54:12] don't have the life of
[1:54:18] God my brother my sister if you are
[1:54:21] still struggling
[1:54:23] with last you are just a religious
[1:54:27] person you are not a child of
[1:54:31] God
[1:54:35] yes if you cannot control your
[1:54:38] temp then you are not still born
[1:54:40] again you are still in
[1:54:43] flesh yes the flesh can you can lose
[1:54:47] temper but you cannot go on with temper
[1:54:54] why the one in
[1:54:56] you who defr the
[1:55:03] temple the one in you will defate the
[1:55:15] temple you're going to have the life of
[1:55:19] God and the nature of God
[1:55:23] he has got so many
[1:55:25] attributes but the nature of God is
[1:55:28] one and his nature is
[1:55:32] [Music]
[1:55:35] love hallelujah hallelujah his nature is
[1:55:40] love so if we can have the nature of
[1:55:44] God let me tell you the attributes of
[1:55:48] God can be counterfeited
[1:55:54] but his
[1:55:55] nature cannot be
[1:55:58] counter Miracles can be
[1:56:01] counter signs and wonders can be
[1:56:04] countered speaking T can be countered
[1:56:08] but the
[1:56:09] nature love can never
[1:56:14] [Applause]
[1:56:17] be much I believe in the power in the
[1:56:21] manifestation of the power
[1:56:25] Spirit one time we were
[1:56:28] attacked with a certain
[1:56:32] sister
[1:56:34] Hallelujah she spoke well we were in the
[1:56:37] conversation that was
[1:56:44] in and again she
[1:56:47] interpreted and they all wor conv they
[1:56:49] say oh spirit of God
[1:56:53] but when I went back to my
[1:56:55] room the Lord showed
[1:56:57] me this is in a
[1:57:01] vision she's eating res and
[1:57:05] snakes then I said I woke up I started
[1:57:09] praying in the morning we went again for
[1:57:12] another conf for another meeting it was
[1:57:14] a three days
[1:57:15] conference she were praying again she
[1:57:17] break
[1:57:19] up then God break me also into the
[1:57:25] vision and God showed
[1:57:27] me her life she was a
[1:57:34] prostitute
[1:57:35] yet spoke Tong and
[1:57:39] interpret
[1:57:41] clearly and the whole conion glorify
[1:57:45] God
[1:57:48] yet this Tong and interpretations is
[1:57:50] coming from a prostitution
[1:57:54] then I asked
[1:57:56] the the one who's in charge of the
[1:58:00] conference I want to speak to that
[1:58:04] sister in the presence of a
[1:58:07] Deon we went in the room when I started
[1:58:11] speaking to
[1:58:13] her trying to interview
[1:58:15] her demon
[1:58:19] manifested the Deacon was shocked
[1:58:23] how possible the one was speaking T and
[1:58:27] interpreting the T here again the pastor
[1:58:29] just
[1:58:31] interviewing
[1:58:34] demons we cast it out then I told her
[1:58:38] your life is not okay
[1:58:40] s then she confessed after confession
[1:58:44] that Tong and
[1:58:49] interpretation hallelujah what am I
[1:58:51] trying to say
[1:58:53] all these things they are good things
[1:58:56] but they are not
[1:58:59] priorities the
[1:59:01] priority is for you to have the spirit
[1:59:03] of God
[1:59:05] in when you have the spirit of God in
[1:59:07] you you become the daughter and son of
[1:59:12] God before you
[1:59:15] know before you
[1:59:17] know you begin to produce the character
[1:59:20] of God
[1:59:22] the of
[1:59:24] God before you know that last you
[1:59:31] haveen that bitterness you
[1:59:33] have vanish
[1:59:36] away before you
[1:59:38] know why
[1:59:42] because the one has born who was best
[1:59:44] have given who has born
[1:59:47] you is in
[1:59:52] [Applause]
[1:59:55] let me tell you what the devil has done
[1:59:56] to the
[1:59:57] church when I'm talking about the
[1:59:59] church is the Believers in the
[2:00:03] en these are just religious these are
[2:00:06] other are just
[2:00:08] religious because we believe the
[2:00:12] prophet and I was shocked one man was
[2:00:16] saying once you believe once you are
[2:00:18] baptized in the
[2:00:22] then you have the message automatically
[2:00:24] you have
[2:00:28] the then I said
[2:00:32] no if that's the
[2:00:35] truth if what you believe is the
[2:00:38] truth then you don't understand their 10
[2:00:45] virgins they were 10 five were
[2:00:48] wise five were foolish and both of them
[2:00:54] all of
[2:00:55] them they had
[2:00:57] lamps and all their
[2:00:59] lamps trimming
[2:01:02] their meaning the light to light to show
[2:01:05] the light to light the love to
[2:01:07] light they had the
[2:01:11] oil but the wise they had
[2:01:18] despair I want you to understand what it
[2:01:20] means the message
[2:01:23] itself it's
[2:01:25] anointed that's why when you have it you
[2:01:28] may feel that you have the Holy Ghost no
[2:01:31] that light is coming direct from the
[2:01:38] lamp it is coming from direct from what
[2:01:43] from but you as your heart you have the
[2:01:49] vessel In Your Vessel must also be
[2:01:54] oil as much as the the the lamp is
[2:01:58] showing
[2:02:00] light surviving from its oil its own
[2:02:03] oil but you must out the
[2:02:07] vessel Vel they must
[2:02:15] be it's not the
[2:02:18] oil which was in the
[2:02:20] lamps which made the wise to sustain
[2:02:24] their the day no it was the oil in the
[2:02:30] vessel so it's not the holy spirit in
[2:02:33] the
[2:02:35] message it's not the power that the
[2:02:37] message
[2:02:39] carries you must have your
[2:02:42] vessel and In Your Vessel must be full
[2:02:46] of when the two
[2:02:49] meets when the two meets
[2:02:52] you survive all
[2:02:55] night weeping endure the
[2:02:58] night but joy comes in the
[2:03:04] morning when you have oil in a
[2:03:09] vessel don't un surviving on the
[2:03:11] anointing of the
[2:03:14] message that's what people they
[2:03:16] believe when you have the the message
[2:03:19] you have the spirit
[2:03:22] no you must have the vessel and you are
[2:03:25] the
[2:03:26] vessel you are the vessel you are the
[2:03:30] vessel then in that
[2:03:32] vessel be filled with
[2:03:39] oil when the trumpet
[2:03:42] sound the Midnight
[2:03:44] Cry they thed they discovered oil is not
[2:03:50] enough they ah
[2:03:55] there's nothing of sharing my anointing
[2:04:00] to there's nothing you must have your
[2:04:09] own no we can't
[2:04:12] share just go and
[2:04:15] find when they went out they missed
[2:04:19] it yes I've read some people
[2:04:22] they said no the vision are in the
[2:04:27] denomination so if you are telling me
[2:04:28] that the VIS are
[2:04:30] in then you are telling that the
[2:04:33] denomination they don't believe in
[2:04:39] Trinity but if they believe in
[2:04:42] Trinity they are not Vance they believe
[2:04:45] in one more in one more than one
[2:04:50] God the is in the
[2:04:54] message if you are not born
[2:04:57] again because virin is
[2:05:00] Purity the message has made you to be a
[2:05:03] good
[2:05:04] person the message has made you to deny
[2:05:07] the
[2:05:09] world but that's not enough my brother
[2:05:11] and
[2:05:12] sister what is enough is to be filled
[2:05:15] with the Holy
[2:05:17] Ghost so that you can
[2:05:20] survive the night
[2:05:27] me I don't
[2:05:28] agree yes it's their own
[2:05:31] understanding no in the message we are
[2:05:33] all the wise the message
[2:05:39] wise but those they believe in
[2:05:43] Trinity even there are some that are
[2:05:45] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:05:47] there
[2:05:50] some but don't believe the true word of
[2:05:53] God they deny the word of
[2:05:56] God they have the perverted
[2:05:59] gospel because the gospel which was
[2:06:02] preached it must be contined to PR until
[2:06:04] he
[2:06:05] comes that's why the Bible tells me
[2:06:08] until this Gospel of the kingdom of
[2:06:10] God to everyone the end shall come and
[2:06:15] Paul said even as or an angel comes from
[2:06:19] heaven and preaches any
[2:06:22] other than the one
[2:06:29] which when we are saying the end time
[2:06:33] message we are saying the gospel of the
[2:06:39] Kingdom this is why the devil has
[2:06:42] complicated
[2:06:44] us complicate the message of the end
[2:06:47] time
[2:06:48] message the end time message is simple
[2:06:51] the gospel of the
[2:06:58] kingdom yes and it was first preached by
[2:07:01] John the
[2:07:03] Baptist what is the gospel of the
[2:07:05] kingdom is repent for the kingdom of God
[2:07:10] is a
[2:07:14] t Jesus came he preached repent for the
[2:07:19] kingom
[2:07:20] of then he disciples
[2:07:23] 12 then he commissioned them go
[2:07:26] therefore make Omission to be my
[2:07:29] disciples baptizing them in the name of
[2:07:31] the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[2:07:33] according to Matthew then Mark comes in
[2:07:37] go and preach the gospel go and preach
[2:07:40] the gospel to Every Creature whoever
[2:07:43] believes and baptized shall
[2:07:50] be Hallelujah
[2:07:52] Hallelujah then Paul
[2:07:57] came if anyone preached any other
[2:08:00] gospel so the prophet is not the one who
[2:08:04] came with the m with the end time
[2:08:08] message he was not the first person in
[2:08:12] this God gave him a
[2:08:14] mission to restore the
[2:08:19] GOP to restore
[2:08:22] it did not come with any other
[2:08:25] doctor that's why sometimes I I get
[2:08:28] confused this this has been my
[2:08:31] prayer God help us to come out this
[2:08:37] confusion of making
[2:08:39] doctrines and making doct to become so
[2:08:46] complicated what do
[2:08:50] believe I tell people that I believe in
[2:08:52] the
[2:08:54] apostolical that's the do I have because
[2:08:57] that's the do the prophet
[2:08:59] preached the do the Apostle the prophet
[2:09:04] restored back to the
[2:09:06] Pentecost that's why he was even
[2:09:08] boasting
[2:09:09] himself PR exactly like
[2:09:13] Paul Paul God called
[2:09:15] him the
[2:09:18] foundation the of God there's no other
[2:09:22] Foundation man can
[2:09:24] Le apart from that which has been
[2:09:27] already and that is Jesus Christ to be
[2:09:31] the chief
[2:09:33] [Applause]
[2:09:36] corner there's no another
[2:09:39] do but see what is happening in the
[2:09:41] message there are so many
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:46] doctrines there's so many doctr trying
[2:09:49] to complicate
[2:09:51] TR to deceive
[2:09:55] many my brother my sister let's come
[2:09:58] back to the will of
[2:10:01] God when we are truly born
[2:10:05] again we're going to have we are going
[2:10:07] to be Sons and Daughters of
[2:10:10] God before you know
[2:10:12] it you have the nature of
[2:10:17] God before you know it all the
[2:10:20] manifestations of the
[2:10:23] flesh
[2:10:27] die this is why the apost
[2:10:30] says I Die
[2:10:32] daily I Die daily so that Christ can
[2:10:38] manifest when you are born again you
[2:10:41] begin to die dead to
[2:10:43] flesh CH begin to manifest and view in
[2:10:46] your
[2:10:48] life even if you are casting out Dem
[2:10:52] you are not casting demons because you
[2:10:54] are a religious
[2:10:55] person you are casting demons because it
[2:10:59] pleases
[2:11:03] him
[2:11:05] yes it's not for the
[2:11:10] show you are doing it because him want
[2:11:15] to be glorified in
[2:11:18] what not for people to see you that Mir
[2:11:23] no you are giving glory to
[2:11:25] him who is in
[2:11:29] you now this is
[2:11:33] why the
[2:11:35] denomination this is why the
[2:11:38] denomination and many people in a
[2:11:41] religious
[2:11:43] Circle they don't value baptism
[2:11:52] but I want to tell you value the
[2:11:57] baptism and make sure that be
[2:12:02] sincere expose
[2:12:07] yourself be naked before
[2:12:10] God and be
[2:12:15] baptized then you receive the Holy
[2:12:17] Spirit
[2:12:21] sometimes ask
[2:12:22] yourself from the time you were born
[2:12:24] again or from the time you were
[2:12:27] baptized I can ask you a question like
[2:12:30] the same question Paul asked the
[2:12:32] Disciples of
[2:12:34] John did you receive the holy
[2:12:39] spirit because we don't get
[2:12:43] baptized just for the sake of getting
[2:12:46] bapz we get
[2:12:48] baptized to open the way
[2:12:52] for the Holy Ghost to fill
[2:12:57] us so if you have been baptized
[2:13:00] water and you have no Holy
[2:13:03] Spirit ask yourself
[2:13:06] why only two
[2:13:09] things
[2:13:13] one and confess the
[2:13:16] sin or you were just baptized
[2:13:21] to praise the pastor and the
[2:13:27] deons you did not
[2:13:31] believe but if you are truly
[2:13:35] believe
[2:13:37] repented and receive the
[2:13:40] baptism there's nothing that can hinder
[2:13:43] you to receive the holy go because this
[2:13:46] is the promise
[2:13:51] this is the
[2:13:54] promise this is the will of
[2:13:58] God God is to fill people with his
[2:14:03] Spirit and the only way God can fill
[2:14:06] people with his
[2:14:07] spirit is to hear the
[2:14:11] gospel repent and
[2:14:14] baptizing and receive the Holy Ghost if
[2:14:18] these things is not happening in your
[2:14:20] life
[2:14:22] it means somewhere
[2:14:25] somehow you are outside the will of
[2:14:30] God you can even serve
[2:14:34] God you can even become a
[2:14:37] pastor you can even L the
[2:14:41] dead
[2:14:43] yet you are not the
[2:14:48] son Hallelujah the denomination there
[2:14:52] some bapz in the name of Jesus
[2:14:55] Christ but it's seated
[2:14:59] gospel because the gospel has only three
[2:15:04] things
[2:15:06] one salvation of a
[2:15:09] soul two
[2:15:13] conduct three
[2:15:17] order see these people imitate the true
[2:15:24] baptism see the way they conduct
[2:15:28] themselves then you see a pered
[2:15:34] gospel hallelujah hallelujah this is
[2:15:37] why me have stopped Pastor me have
[2:15:42] stopped blessing heavy Lords on sisters
[2:15:46] and
[2:15:48] brothers dress well dress well
[2:15:52] we are making
[2:15:58] Hypocrites but when somebody deceive the
[2:16:00] Holy
[2:16:01] Ghost the holy spirit will teach you how
[2:16:04] to the holy spirit will teach you how to
[2:16:07] look the will teach you how to speak the
[2:16:11] spirit will teach you how to
[2:16:16] behave this is why we have sent in every
[2:16:19] Fellowship
[2:16:22] but in homes we have got
[2:16:24] demons but when We
[2:16:26] Gather when you
[2:16:29] look Saints even misot the
[2:16:34] prophet at the growth of the church you
[2:16:36] have to look to the
[2:16:40] sisters you find sisters are
[2:16:45] natural but when you go
[2:16:48] home the way they mistreat their husand
[2:16:55] the way they mistreat their
[2:17:00] dependence the way they Mist their
[2:17:06] neighbors
[2:17:08] why I don't blame them that is AIC
[2:17:15] nature that's theic
[2:17:18] nature and the works of the flesh
[2:17:25] Brothers they look
[2:17:28] nice but when you go
[2:17:31] home they punch their wife like
[2:17:38] punching in their heart there's no
[2:17:43] love I tells
[2:17:46] brothers that if you can raise your hand
[2:17:51] beat your
[2:17:52] wife then you were a mad
[2:17:54] person one day we had we had couples
[2:17:58] meeting then I told
[2:18:01] sisters if your
[2:18:03] husband beats you let me know so that we
[2:18:06] begin to look for a Psy psychatric
[2:18:11] doctor because he must be
[2:18:16] mad then all Brothers looked at
[2:18:18] me then one how
[2:18:21] P then I okay I'll answer
[2:18:24] you you I want you yourself the one who
[2:18:26] have asked me a
[2:18:28] question I want you to tell me you find
[2:18:32] me starting punching

[2:18:50] father

[2:18:55] shall
[2:18:58] be then you are beating
[2:19:02] yourself you a m
[2:19:05] person you are a mad
[2:19:08] person
[2:19:10] yes no what if she goes she makes
[2:19:14] mistakes I I asked him a question in
[2:19:18] your life when you are doing your own
[2:19:20] thing

[2:19:24] and beat

[2:19:28] mistake you have made yes so even your
[2:19:31] wife makes a
[2:19:37] mistake Hallelujah just feel

[2:19:45] again they're always in
[2:19:48] flesh in the flesh
[2:19:51] has no perfect
[2:19:54] love because perfect
[2:19:56] love covers the
[2:20:01] M if God did not love
[2:20:04] you no one was going to be
[2:20:07] saved because there a perfect
[2:20:10] love covered all
[2:20:13] your and bring you
[2:20:15] back so that you can be his son
[2:20:21] so that he can give the spirit in
[2:20:25] you so that you can be led by the
[2:20:29] spirit this is the only
[2:20:31] difference between the law and the
[2:20:38] grace
[2:20:42] Hallelujah the
[2:20:45] grace is for you to receive the Holy
[2:20:47] Ghost
[2:20:52] God in
[2:20:53] you to
[2:20:56] you but the law is a forcing
[2:21:00] [Music]
[2:21:03] matter fearing people if they see me do
[2:21:08] this that's why law has not saved
[2:21:13] anyone God bless you
[2:21:16] [Applause]
[2:21:29] hallelujah
[2:21:30] hallelujah amen this was worth our
[2:21:36] time Amen Let us give another clap of
[2:21:39] praise to the
[2:21:41] Lord
[2:21:45] amen Pastor
[2:21:47] Paul this is exactly what I believe
[2:21:54] this is what we believe
[2:21:56] here I have been so immensely blessed
[2:21:59] and
[2:22:03] refreshed the first experience I had
[2:22:06] with in Zambia was not
[2:22:10] good because I was cheated by somebody I
[2:22:13] told you that story
[2:22:16] some when I was entering
[2:22:19] Zambia and then the other person I
[2:22:22] met a minister I had an encounter with
[2:22:25] from
[2:22:26] Zambia I did not love the way they
[2:22:28] presented the
[2:22:31] words but today I've had a fresh
[2:22:34] connection with
[2:22:37] [Music]
[2:22:39] Zambia the our precious brother has
[2:22:42] preached the
[2:22:44] message and I'm one person who does not
[2:22:48] believe the message of works
[2:22:53] and actually he he presented it so
[2:22:58] well and really this sermon today is the
[2:23:01] reason why I Don't Preach
[2:23:05] works I preach
[2:23:08] Grace and he has told us
[2:23:10] Grace is receiving the holy
[2:23:13] spirit because when you receive the Holy
[2:23:16] Spirit The Works will come automatically
[2:23:21] but if you don't have the Holy
[2:23:23] Spirit and we will force you and teach
[2:23:27] you and show you what to do tell how
[2:23:30] to then you will live well before
[2:23:34] us but the moment you are in your
[2:23:36] private
[2:23:37] space you will live completely contrary
[2:23:40] to what we we Tau
[2:23:44] you and that's why we should preach the
[2:23:47] message of
[2:23:49] Grace amen not of
[2:23:52] works and you know I've been thinking
[2:23:54] about the Rich Young
[2:23:56] Ruler the Rich Young Ruler was a good
[2:24:00] man his Works were good
[2:24:03] works but you see he was not filled with
[2:24:05] the Holy
[2:24:06] Spirit he was not in the will of God and
[2:24:10] when he came to Jesus and Jesus showed
[2:24:13] him the way of the will of
[2:24:15] God he couldn't do it why because he
[2:24:18] could not forsake
[2:24:21] he could not expose himself and forsake
[2:24:23] everything
[2:24:25] else and that's what we need to do and
[2:24:29] that is what our generation has failed
[2:24:31] to
[2:24:32] do and the Bible says this this man went
[2:24:35] away sad in
[2:24:38] his because he had many
[2:24:40] possessions many Believers have a lot of
[2:24:44] possessions things they not willing to
[2:24:46] live UNC confessed sins
[2:24:50] they willing to cover
[2:24:52] up and the moment you are like that you
[2:24:55] cannot be filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:24:58] and if you're not filled with the Holy
[2:25:00] Spirit you will miss the
[2:25:02] Rapture and if you miss the
[2:25:05] Rapture you are not part of the
[2:25:09] bride and a brother mentioned that
[2:25:12] example of of the sister with the gift
[2:25:14] of
[2:25:17] tongues you know he said all these gifts
[2:25:19] can be counter
[2:25:23] fated and I know some may have a
[2:25:26] question on that how
[2:25:28] possible all gifts of the Spirit can be
[2:25:35] fed but one thing cannot cannot be
[2:25:39] fixed is the nature of
[2:25:42] Christ that comes out of receiving the
[2:25:45] spirit of Jesus Christ
[2:25:50] appetite of dressing
[2:25:53] bad living
[2:25:55] immoral lustful
[2:25:58] Spirits you don't need to fight with
[2:26:00] them it's not about
[2:26:02] struggling it's about yielding
[2:26:05] yourself and letting God fill you with
[2:26:07] the
[2:26:09] spirit when you are filled with the
[2:26:11] spirit then you receive a new
[2:26:14] nature the nature that is an an
[2:26:17] overcoming nature
[2:26:20] and the prophet of God would speak about
[2:26:22] men or people who are
[2:26:26] gifted maybe to compliment on what our
[2:26:28] brother
[2:26:29] said with that sister that um was
[2:26:32] speaking in tongues
[2:26:34] and yet leaving the wrong kind of
[2:26:37] life and not being a
[2:26:39] believer of not being filled with the
[2:26:41] spirit of God it is possible and a
[2:26:45] prophet in the message and this is a
[2:26:47] message I recommend to each of you to go
[2:26:48] and listen
[2:26:51] they anointed ones at the end
[2:26:54] time it's a very important message for
[2:26:56] believers to listen
[2:26:58] to brother bam preached it in the year
[2:27:04] 1965 it's just a little paragraph I read
[2:27:07] to
[2:27:08] you the same holy spirit that anoints
[2:27:10] the
[2:27:13] church that gives them desire to save
[2:27:17] Souls that it gives them power to
[2:27:19] perform miracle
[2:27:22] that same Holy Spirit it folds on the
[2:27:27] unjust the same as it falls on the
[2:27:31] Jud the same Holy
[2:27:34] Spirit it says the very same
[2:27:38] Spirit now you can't make it another
[2:27:42] way and you understand 244
[2:27:54] he said there shall arise false
[2:27:58] [Music]
[2:28:00] Christ false anointed
[2:28:03] ones now he says false anointed
[2:28:10] ones false anointed ones
[2:28:22] so and the prophet continues to say
[2:28:25] anointed listen this is very
[2:28:27] wonderful Anointed with a genuine
[2:28:34] thing
[2:28:36] but be false prophets to
[2:28:42] it false teachers of
[2:28:46] it they are anointed with the right
[2:28:48] genuine Holy Spirit
[2:28:52] but they are false teachers of that
[2:29:02] Spirit they are false teachers they
[2:29:04] false
[2:29:06] preachers but they are anointed with the
[2:29:08] right
[2:29:10] Spirit that's why someone can speak
[2:29:14] tongues prophesy even
[2:29:18] preach even raise the Dead
[2:29:21] talk about any Miracle you
[2:29:23] know signs and
[2:29:25] wonders people can perform them and
[2:29:29] still not make it in the
[2:29:33] Rapture what will help them to make it
[2:29:37] what will help all of us to make
[2:29:39] it is by being in the will of
[2:29:43] God perfect will of God is for us to be
[2:29:46] filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:29:50] he says don't survive on the oil upon
[2:29:53] the
[2:29:56] message the message is Anointed by the
[2:29:59] way that's why you know a woman preacher
[2:30:02] will preach
[2:30:04] it and the moment she begin preaching it
[2:30:07] she will be
[2:30:08] excited she she will be anointed and she
[2:30:11] will prophesy and she will speak that
[2:30:14] that word and that word will will do
[2:30:16] things in the lives of people
[2:30:21] she's not supposed to even
[2:30:24] preach but why is she anointed because
[2:30:28] the word is
[2:30:32] Anointed anyone who will preach the word
[2:30:35] amen will receive the anointing
[2:30:39] of but we have been told
[2:30:42] tonight that you can sit there in the
[2:30:45] message believe the message and be in
[2:30:48] church around the word and you even
[2:30:52] think and presume you filled with the
[2:30:56] spirit because you feel like a
[2:30:58] Believer but you see you are just around
[2:31:01] the oil or the anointing of the
[2:31:05] [Applause]
[2:31:07] word he says you you should receive your
[2:31:10] own oil in your own
[2:31:15] vessel you are that vessel and God wants
[2:31:19] to fill that vessel with his
[2:31:25] oil praise the name of the Lord those
[2:31:28] were wonderful nuggets that have been
[2:31:31] blessed the gospel of the
[2:31:34] kingdom is the end time
[2:31:38] message the end time message is not
[2:31:40] another
[2:31:42] teaching it is not another
[2:31:44] denomination it is not an
[2:31:47] idea that started with William br
[2:31:50] this is the apostolic
[2:31:54] message that the apostles preach that
[2:31:57] the apostles believed brother Bram only
[2:32:00] restored it back to
[2:32:04] chch this is what we
[2:32:07] believe this is the original
[2:32:09] message this is the first message and we
[2:32:13] are the original
[2:32:15] Pentecost we are not believing some kind
[2:32:18] of new doctrine
[2:32:21] we are not a
[2:32:22] cult never preached anything that is not
[2:32:25] in the
[2:32:28] Bible everything the message
[2:32:31] is you will find it here he said if I
[2:32:35] preach
[2:32:36] anything that is not in the Bible leave
[2:32:39] it alone but the reason why we believe
[2:32:42] the message is because it is a bible
[2:32:47] message it is not a new doctrine
[2:32:50] we are not a new
[2:32:52] denomination by the way that is why we
[2:32:54] are not a
[2:32:56] denomination because we are
[2:33:00] Christians we are followers of Jesus
[2:33:03] Christ we are walking in the perfect
