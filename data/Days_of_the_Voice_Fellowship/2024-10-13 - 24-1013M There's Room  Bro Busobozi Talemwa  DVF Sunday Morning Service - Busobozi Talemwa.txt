with me to the Book of Genesis 26 we are reading from vers 18 to vers 24 while you opening I want to greet each and every one of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen are you ready for the word amen 26 18 24 and Isaac digged again okay I can begin from 17 and Isaac departed then and I think my sound would need to be fine tuned a little bit maybe increased a little bit and Isaac departed then and pitched his tent in the valley of gual and dwelt there and Isaac digged again the whals of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his father for the Philistines had stopped them after the death of Abraham and he called their names after the names by which his father had called them and Isaac's servant digged in the valley and found there a well of springing water and the hadman of Geral did strive with Isaac's hadman saying the water is ours and he called the name of the well esek because they strove with him and they digged another well and strove for that also and he called the name of it sitner and he removed from then and digged another well and for that they strove not and he called the name of it reoboth and he said for now the Lord has made room for us and we shall be fruitful in the land amen for for amen you may be seated may the Lord bless the reading of the word uh first of all i' would like to appreci and I'd like you to join me to appreciate uh sister Angela who the Lord used to buy the other third FL [Applause] we we appreciate your giving amen and there are three things that I wanted to talk about today but I'll talk uh about two of them at the end of the service uh yes I talk about the two of them at the end of the service one is about the land fund and the other for our youth upcoming Youth Camp so I talk I'll address those at the end of the service but for now I just wanted to say that we've had a wonderful week and the Lord laid it on my heart uh to do a little more or evangelism but you see I believe that it's it's not resting on the on the shoulders of the pastor alone I believe it is resting on all our shoulders it is not my burden it is our burden of course I'm speaking to those who have been called by the Lord and are saved and if you're born again then you should have a burden for the lost souls and so we felt that um we need to do a little more evangelism to reach out to more souls about with this message of the AR and so we started um what we call home sales so we decided to bring Church closer to the Believers and already there are many testimonies coming out of it um the different cells and these are scattered all across the city and wherever our brothers and sisters from this church are coming and um on Monday uh I was I had an opportunity to go and I was with this with the Believers who are fellow who go to school at ucu and um we met the sister peace who goes to school there and brother nille I think both of them are not here this morning so brother neille is is he lost somebody so he went for bu the and so uh the Believers there have gathered their friends Gathering their friends every Monday and so they invited me so I am the one taking care of that Fellowship there and we we are expecting God to do a lot we we we preached I think we on Monday we had more more than 10 people uh being our first day so I believe more souls will hear this message that school has 11 I think I was told an estimate of about 11,000 people I believe that God will reach out to many many with this message this message is not for us to sleep on and die you know God must bring in the very last one every predestinated child of God should come wherever they are God will find them and brother and also brother Marvin was ministering to the Saints in mukono um I received a good testimony out of there how they were blessed at they gathering at sister Esther's home God bless s eser who opened your home for that they they I think they had um I was told a few new people I think two three three yes three new people so those are three new Souls who had the message for the first time at the University we had about also four new and also brother Jo ministered in place and then also we were I think was that on on Thursday in innd uh we had a good time there we had seven new I don't remember how many were they sister G you don't remember it was at Dr M's place they invited all their neighbors and we we we met somewhere there's a gentleman who has an office there but he has a good field so he gave it to us a good compound but we agreed with brother M and others this this next Thursday we shall not do it there you know he has a clinic there we want to and it's right on the road we want to do it right in front at the at the road and we want to get speakers so we shall be preaching and speaking when everyone there whether you want to hear or not you are hearing the message and I thought that was a good idea so that's what we are intending to do by God's grace on Thursday and we don't have that speaker so if you want to buy that speaker or speakers more than one you're welcome to do that we had one but I think it got issues so I believe that the Lord will will do will do wonderful things there and then on Friday we were in at in ch brother where brother Alan lives and we we had um uh I think one new person and several Believers there we were all together I think in that Fellowship that day did we get to 15 probably 10 to 15 people and um this sister asked a lot of questions I believe she will come to the message this lady and brother Dan also was at in uh what's the name of the brother where's brother brother Mandela yes over at brother Mandela's house and I was told they also had a wonderful time uh sister Agatha was there as well Enoch so if you are coming from an area where you don't have any Fellowship during the week by the mar they met in in G I don't remember the day but they usually meet in G and I was told they also had a good time and um also on Friday Brother Martin went and ministered over at sister Rose's house and I was told it was wonderful there about 60 neighbors came and they had the message and they loved the message and as soon as brother Mar finished preaching there is a a young lady I don't know whether she's here that my mom lives with and um uh you know she came from the village with a familiar spirit that has been troubling her for a while so she came in here we cast it out and she became fine and then you know um um so then she's been fine for a while and so Sister Rose decided to begin living at at home because of different reasons and so for a while I think about two weeks and those demons recollected themselves they came back and began to meting so for for some time think about a week so Brother Martin went and preached uh this Friday after finishing the summer everybody was happy and new people were there and they asked them do you have any question anybody with any question and before they could even raise up their hand this Spirit came on this girl so heav and you know she fell down and lied as though dead and so Brother Martin was he said a battle was raging in him should I pray for her or I just leave her I continue the service and then he say he kind of felt I should pray for her so he went to lay he was closing his eyes so you went to lay the hand on her and this Spirit was so angry with brother M so it came with a big blow to him give him a big blow and then he realized hey what's happening here so and it was really a very intense battle and so this he gave me the testimony and I was so amazed by what God Our God can do and so this Spirit began talking and manifesting so you people thought you had cast me out I have come back and you know your Jesus does not have power and so Brother Martin would talk and this talk and so he prayed and cast out the and so he was wondering there are unbelievers here so what if this does not go they will all say your Jesus is not powerful but I tell you our Jesus is powerful amen am there is no demon or there is no power that is beyond our the name of our Lord Jesus the devil will fight all right you know but let me tell you he can never win because our Jesus is stronger because the word we believe is powerful more powerful the weapons of our Warfare are not it pulls down every stronghold and so that demon left after a big intense battle and SS like Brother Martin you see that's where Jesus sent two by two I said Wherever I Go I I don't go alone I go with a brother so you brothers that are ministering in this places go with somebody go with reinforcement but also as a church we should pray for the ministry we should pray for the vision that God has given us burden that we have you know there are many things that look like as if it will be defeated but the purpose of God cannot be defeated what God has thought will be perfected and it will surely come to pass and and so with those things I just want to go to the word and this morning I'm speaking on there is room Gathering Souls not building a [Music] denomination tell someone Gathering Souls not building a denomination and so you see this man here Isaac digged again the wells of water which they had digged in the days of Abraham his [Music] father and you know they were buried and they were there and they were dead for a long time but as soon as he came to dig them up the Philistines came out you know the Bible says the Philistines had stopped these Wells when Abraham died and so they when Isaac came up to dig them again um you know water began coming out and so the Hard Men of this place came against the hadman the the hadman of Isaac and they began to say this this water is ours and you know Isaac did not debate with them did not strive with them he simply left them to continue knew owning what they thought they owned and he called the name of that place the name of that well is because they strove with him and they died another well and this when he dig another well then these people came again they said this one is also ours brother never strive with anyone never strive with no what God has given you amen can multiply the blessing that God has given you can multiply you find people fighting for land a portion and each of them is fighting for it and sometimes they even kill each other you see the blessing of God make and he adds no sorrow amen and if so God wants to bless you he will bless you in the city and he will bless you in the village no matter where you go if someone is fighting for something that belongs to you don't worry it is flourishing because of you you didn't hear me it is flourishing because of you so what you simply need to do is to walk away don't fight with no man on any issue are you hearing me don't ever fight with anyone if someone is fighting for something let them have it because the blessing of God rests with you it is not in the place it is in you you know there is nothing like a holy place there is nothing like a holy mountain there is nothing like a holy you know you know Church there is only a holy God and wherever holy God is that place is Holy if God is on the mountain it is a Holy Mountain if God is in the church it is a holy church if God is in a village it is a holy Village if God is in a land it is a holy land wherever he is that place is Holy and now what about if God is in a person you are a holy person the Bible says you are a holy PRI so whenever you go you are the one taking with yourself the Holiness of God I am the embodiment of the power of God the favor of God the blessing of God wherever I go there will be Prosperity why because I am a son of prosperity you are a child of prosperity never accept to be reduced down to fight for things whatever God has given you is in you not in the thing hallelujah amen and so they Str with the world they Str with another world and he said okay I'll leave it to you and I will move on and God will bless me any and so he went and dug another whale and no one came up to fight for and he said all right I'll call this one theob which means amen God has now the Lord has made room for us everybody tell your but God has made room there is room Hallelujah I just want to take this in a certain way and I pray that that the Lord will help us to bring it now I'm going to quote for you several quotes and scriptures so listen in the message God is provided way brother bam says that's about like our Pentecostal churches today one of them says glory to God I belong to the Assemblies of God the other one says I am the Church of God and the other one says me I am UPC United another one says me I am Ang I am that or the other you keep grumbling and God is God God cut the water off from you there is something I want you to see today even what we are doing the evangelism and going there what is our vision what are we trying to do what is our job this what I want to impress upon your hearts this morning what is the purpose of this message is it to build another denomination is it to build to make another organization what is this about you know it used to be some years ago Believers of the message used one license um because you see to operate a church you need to have a legal require I mean the legal requirement to operate a church is a license because you can't just well you have we have freedom of worship but you see we we have to be known by the government how does the government know us who are we so then we we we we we put up some articles of Association and things like that and then we tell the government is who we are this is what we believe and we want to come together into an association just stay focused here and so we want to have to be in a fellowship of and we want to to run a church and so the government says okay so in other words for them to know we are not some kind of terrorist oh we are not a political party but we are just Christians you know this requirements of having a license no the requirement of having a [Music] license is not required by God God does not require us to have a license to run a church God does not require us to have a license to preach the gospel in the Bible they gathered in homes of Believers every day and then on Sunday they all met together and that's what we are trying to do We Gather in homes of Believers and then we meet together that's all God requires and it requires you to be filled with the Holy Spirit that's all it requires but because we are part of a country which has a constitution we need to have a license we need to be permitted by the government to operate and so in in the in the first years you would find that Believers simply would just go to a church which is registered and say can can I have your license and the things I'm going to be talking about are very important please don't do if it does I will embarrass you I've warned you I'll call out your name and I say brother stop sister stop do praise the name of the Lord because this what I'm speaking about is very important okay and if you on the internet you are doing a hope you not wasting your internet for nothing all right so the the requirement of the [Music] government is for us to have a license but we don't the word of God doesn't require us to have one so to to have a license you also need to have a name a name you run by so you say well me I'll be called um so and so redeemed Church oh like for us we said we will be called we took a scripture in Revelation 107 says Shall be Called days of the voice so we said we are days of the voice Ministries another one will go take another name and say I am this I am that I'm trying to draw your attention that those things are not important to it is just for the government for the legal requirement but you see in the first Believers would even use one license but that is also not important whether we using one license or we using 100 license that doesn't matter what matters is the message we are preaching what matters is the gospel we are propagating that that is what differentiates us from the denominations there is a truth I want to share with you today and I want you to be sober and not miss what I'm going to share with you this morning and so brother bam says you know he was trying to type these Wells you know the whales that they dug and these people kept on fighting for them and he said it's like the these Pentecostal churches today they are so proud of being those names you know mine is called Church of God m is Assemblies of God and these days even in the message churches in some unlearned men you find that they think that having those I mean those names are important those names are not important to God whether you are called DVS or you are called you know the names of the churches and message that you know here in Uganda it doesn't matter to God but these people they thought that that was what is important and they began you know it says they began grumbling but you see it says God had already cut off the water from them you know when they came and began grumbling for these Wells you know Isaac had already moved away and the water went with him it is not about the well it is about the water in the well it's not about your church name it's about the amen the gospel the message you propag and so they began Grambling this is ours this is ours it is our water he said okay it is yours it is all right you can continue with it and he dug another and when they saw he had gone away and D another one maybe this water dried up and they and they saw him having water there no this is also ours said oh you also want no problem and another let me tell you it is not about the whale it's about the water in there and he said he let them to Grumble but God had already cut off the water what denominationalism does it cuts off the flow of the water that is why we are not a denomination why are we doing evangelism why are we preaching we are not trying to start another denomination we are only Gathering the bride we are gathering Souls why because we are in a place where there is room and the place where we are there is room for everyone there is room for the Catholics there is room for the angri there is room for the Pentecostal it doesn't matter which name they call themselves this is the Water of Life it is for every man to drink and he says this someone will be a life changer for some people listen you keep grumbling and God has cut the water off from me get your heart together the streams will open up again what we need tonight is a good old fashion outp powering gasha from [Music] Heaven what do we need do we need a great big organization we need a good water flowing from heaven we need a connection with God I think about your separations he says Jacob had a very clear type of that he dug one well and the Philistines run him away he called it malice they dug another well and the philes run him away he his stri he D another way he said there is room for us that's right everybody come and drink that's what is it is tonight room room yes there is room there is room at the fountain for every person in here every sin sick Soul there is room at the fountain every sick and Afflicted there is room at the fountain that is our burden that is our vision brother it does not matter what denomination they come from we are not a denomination because we are representing Christ and we welcome everyone to come and drink in the message trying to do God service without being without being the will of God there are many things which I will say today which will give you some good spiritual vitamins don't never start or try an organiz don't try to build upon anything else but stay humble before the Lord your God for it looks like the gates may open into the promised land soon how many believe that the gates are opening anytime soon let go in with a true singing and [Music] rejoicing when the bride and groom takes his place at the throne he says brother listen leave humble leave loving leave one another love one another brother don't never get nothing among you if you see something coming up in in your heart against somebody get it out from their right then and Satan will do his best to get among you don't you let that happen sat want you know let me tell you Church there is one thing the devil cannot do the devil cannot stop the water the flow of the water the devil cannot fight with what God has done and what God has done he he has brought the message to us but what does the devil do he comes in among the people who have received a message and he tries to make them you know Hur one another try to bring bitterness and you find some people speaking as though they are the only ones who have access to Heaven There is no one human being has access to Heaven not even our Prophet brother he did not have the the access to Heaven only one man has access or rather gives access his name is Jesus Christ and as long as a preacher is preaching the message then he has the key then he has the access for the people but there is no one who can stand up and say if you are not in my church you are not going to the Rapture Hallelujah the Catholics say only the Catholics will go to the the anglicans say only the angc the Pentecostal say only Pentecostal even among them they have divisions each of them say our group is the one going but I will tell you my brother my sister this message has told us love everybody leave humble if you see something coming in your heart against somebody get it out of your heart it is only the message which is the word of God that will will have will open access to Heaven people no one single denomination has now imagine a Believer who is coming from Days of the voice Fellowship claiming our church days of the The Voice Fellowship is the only one taking people to the r what about another brother coming from inner Veil Fellowship fellow it means he will not go I thank God for this message because it has made us understand it is not about the we it's about the water if your has the water right and that's why we should love one another Believers are not only here there are believers all over the world there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all afame with the fire that fell at Pentecost which cleansed and made them clean it is burning now within my heart Oh Glory to his name I am so glad I can say I am one of them I am not the only one but I am one of them every Fellowship every preacher every believer every brother sisters believing the true message of God they have the fountain flowing they our brothers we should love them we should fellowship with them the spirit of bitterness is not of God and I want to show you today the spirit of bitterness is connected to a spirit of denomination the spirit of bitterness is what made Roman Catholicism to kill people because they did something that their Church did not accept imagine a man like William tindel he translated the scriptures into English and at that time it was not permitted by the Roman Catholic Church to translate scriptures into a lay man's language it was not even permitted for anyone to read it but God anointed a man his name was William Tinder and he went against what the church was saying and he did what the word was saying brother we are not under control of any church system the mess has liberated us the mess has delivered us the only one who has authority over us is the word and the Holy Spirit and that man went R according to them and he decided to translate the scriptures so they said because you have gone the church doctr we are going to kill you he said all right no problem you can go ahead they tied him on a stick and put firewood on his feet and they lit that fire and the man burnt away but I'll tell you something they can kill the flesh they cannot kill the soul as long as it is well with your soul the system May discard you the system May reject you but you see there is a well of water springing out from you amen it's a Well of Living Water and sat will try to even among the message Believers he has tried to bring in to creep in with that spein and try to separate Brotherhood the moment you find people beginning to think that our church is the best our pastor is the best that's a wrong Spirit coming is the wrong Spirit friends I hope you never have it here it's the wrong spirit you should always have this in your mind the message we have is the truth the spirit we have received the spirit of God that is our absolute don't you let that happen he said some sck Tong fellow might come along and try to take you away from it you think they could talk Moses out of the presence of [Music] God where he had been there and he had seen it is there anyone who can talk us out of the presence of God there is no one who can talk us out of the presence hallelujah amen Moses no one could talk him about we don't take from it or we don't add to it just keep it in the way the Lord said we don't want no denomination we don't want no denomination we don't want no organizations we don't want no malice we don't want no stri we want God and he is the word come on shout it we want God he is the one that's why we have come out out of organization out of denominations the Bible says come out of her my people don't be partakers of our sins we have come out of denominations we have been liberated we have been set free we have been filled with the Holy Ghost we are being prepared The Chariot of fire is coming down soon soon and very soon we shall see the king because he's coming down and I'm going up I said he coming down and I'm going up are you going to if you are not excited by that then I don't know if you know what I'm talking about but if you know what I'm talking about will move your heart it will excite your soul because you will realize you are like an eego soon and very soon you are going to fly out of this world they will ask you are you a Catholic no are you Anglican no are you Pentecostal Organization no what are you we can't understand you you are confused which denomination are you from where is your headquarters who is your bishop and they will never get all those answers they can count the anglicans in the world they can count the Catholics in the world they can count the Pentecost in the world but do you know what there is no one who knows the number of Believers of the word in the world because this message movement is not a denomination we have no headquarter we don't we don't even know how many numbers of Believers we have why because the Bible says the secret is he knows his [Music] [Applause] own hallelujah amen even if they counted in all message Believers churches and they count all those Believers still they will have a wrong number because you may find 100 people here but maybe the Believers are five we don't know how many we are preaching to one in a million the Rapture is one in a million the shark will not be with a s hallelujah amen this message is for the seed and soon and very soon the seed will be harvested and we shall come out of this world and we will go to glory and the others will be left in their denominations in their organizations with their Arch Bishops but for us we shall go with the bishop of our soul on to Glory Hallelujah I am so glad I can say I am one of them hallelujah amen why because I am in in there is room room for everybody every song you see is a potential believer preach to them the message tell to every fall brother to every sister there is room for you room at the fountain I tell you when someone goes out with this message you are a dynamite because you can go anywhere with this message and it it will sell Hallelujah woo yes you go to the Roman Catholics and you just speak one little mystery one God not three 20 is from hell what's wrong with you you getting that from you go to the anglicans you just say one thing baptism of babies is from hell where did you get that from you say pcal they are fine you go to the pentec and you tell them where did you get anything like women preachers what about that there is a group called The UPC in E called Church which is they believe they the first church because a means apostles believe they the apostolic church we call them the Jesus only here or the UPC or the apostolic church but they believe they have the truth but you go to them with this message you pull one truth because you know they believe women should not preach some of them some of them they believe in Holiness they dress properly come on what do you believe almost everything they believe in one God they baptized in Jesus name m M almost like message but you pull out one one from the message and you tell I saw this man I spoke to him and SP he was debating debating de like these Philistines and I said uh I said to myself I am tired of debating and I said to him do you know about Malachi 4 he said what is Mal I said okay keep Qui let me teach you and I showed him there is an Elijah to come last and he's going to pull out the Mysteries he was seeing stars and then I went I took another level one of the Mysteries the serpent seed you know some children here in the world children children of Serpent and others of God he was seeing Stars why not because I knew too much but because where I am the water the river is [Music] Flowing this message can sell everywhere everywhere you go they need it all over the world the spirit is moving all over the world as God said it will do and where is it moving it's moving in every place it's moving in every person open their heart for more Revelation because Revelation comes from God we are not building a system William Bram never started a religion we are not members of any religion in the world they ask you what is your religion you just say what you want to say brother if you want to say Catholic no problem because I'm the First Catholic and the original Catholic Catholic means churchu and they are the wrong Catholic Church I am not the Roman Catholic church because the Roman Catholic Church is the wrong Catholic church I'll prove that right now the Roman Catholic church does not does not believe their popes their Bishops marry but my Catholic Church My First bishop his name called Peter he was a married man and the Roman Catholic Church they claim Peter was also their first so they first married why don't they marry I am the original Catholic Church We Are The Universal Church is all over the world they call you pentec yes we are Pentecost we are everything and we are not you are confusing we are confusing because even he that is in US is confusing they can't understand they call him man and yet he was God and he says yes I am man 100% And I am God 100% said you are confusing he said if you don't believe I am he you will die in your sin before Abraham was I was I am before Abraham was I am meaning he is the same yesterday today and forever he was he is he to come and we are only a part of him that's why we confuse the world we confuse the nonbelievers is there anyone confused here Believers we confuse the nonbelievers if they didn't understand him they won't understand us if they didn't believe him they won't believe us but we know where we are standing the first two worlds there were type of denominations denominations separate Brotherhood it takes away the fire and burden to focus on the truth Isaiah each time never wasted time with the philes he never wasted time we should never waste time with denominations in the message why are we not have denomination a prophet says so we don't have any denomination all believer should shout to them because I think the denomination separate Brotherhood yes of course says every believer should have a home church but what does it mean is not meaning the church here the church there the chur we have one Church of the Bride today and in the generations before one church but we are in different physical areas and so because of that we have fellowships everywhere so a Believer should subscribe to be a member or to regular Fellowship in one of those churches how about if you are believed from here and I'm your pastor but you feel that you will be better under another preacher if you decide to go there are you a sinner no you are not Pastor what you saying is going to take away the people let them go as long as they in another body of Christ I mean if they are in the same body of Christ if you have gone to another fellowship it is all right you're not saying Amen on that say Amen the decision to do that has been given to every individual it's not your pastor that decides for you it is you decide for yourself as long as you are led by the spirit of God the problem is for you to be floating around you never have a home church that is not correct why because you will not grow this Sunday you are here another Sunday you are there another Sunday you are here another Sunday you are there the Pentecostals do that for us we are our Prophet has told us find our own church stay there pay your ties support give offering be there physically in every service not when you want in every service participate in what they are doing and then you will grow some people never grow because they are fls you FL the and you never grow spirit and you are never delivered from your demons because you are floting floting you come in dvf when God is beginning to work on you and I said something which will struck you I've changed now I'm in evening light when you go to evening light they will preach you say this is my chur from today and another time the pastor will come and he will say something which you are doing and condemn you repent this will not be easy now I'm in in a veil now I'm in life boat you are always floating and so you don't grow you don't change and you know we have what we call okay you know when you are cooking thank you when you are cooking how many have ever cooked sweet potatoes you people don't know how to you only cook rice and chicken if you're cooking sweet potatoes and then you remove it from the fire before it is ready you willess it oh it is hard okay let me take it back it will not it will continue being hard let me put more fire it will never be soft why in English it is what it has the English speakers I'm sorry I don't know the word no matter how much you cook these people they can sit under firey preachers they can sit under revivalist they can sit when God is filling people with Holy Ghost nothing will happen yeah you see they don't attend church they attend they don't attend they attend until you feel like should I call the person and I pray for him but you see this person is lukewarm is's not hot not cold he confused he looks like a Believer and again is's not completely he we don't understand him may you never be like that brother sister if you decide to Fellowship in one Fellowship be there don't dis Fellowship the others though if there is a convention or special meetings or something like that we are encouraged always to be a part of those Fellowship but you see when there is a service and your pastor prepared to preach to you come to your church and here because you see your pastor has a burden for you praise the name of the Lord and so friends if you see um as much as we have different fellowships all in the same body we are not a denomination our denomination denomination separate Brotherhood in here we have maybe more than 100 fellowships of of message believer and they all our brothers they are all our sisters we love them and they love us and this man had sleept in some other way we I'm reading from the message Fellowship he couldn't have Fellowship for he wasn't dressed right and when a man let his Creed or his denomination separate him from his brother something is wrong he slipped in by denational gate talking about that man that rather the angel kicked out and something like that and the Bible said bind him and throw him out of the outer the dark where there will be weeping and wailing and nashing of praise the name of the Lord now friends today I'm going to read for you out of the church AG book specifically from uh uh the regime of the ages the res others they call the rese okay it's kind of a long reading but very rich how many have appetite what I've given you so far is Red Pepper so you can get appetite to hear what I'm going to read so listen now watch this doctrine of Bal carefully brother bam here talks about two doctrines the do of balam and the doctrine of niolon notice above all that the bam will will do deliberate maneuver it is a deliberate maneuver of a corrupt it is a deliberate maneuver of a corrupt clergy to bind the people to them [Music] are you following me you see how this is how the of work it deliberately Maneuvers to corrupt Believers when who does that they corrupt preachers and they want to bind the people to them them have you ever heard of people of a preacher who has told you if you leave this church you're finished you're finished I am the person supposed to take you to heaven to lead you to heaven if you leave this church you're finished others that stand on the pulpit and they use their gift all youu I see you were going to perish this was going to happen and that was going to happen but because you here and the man of God me myself I'm speaking to you you are saved and and and the others on the microphone prophesy Papa say yes our man of godish these are corrupt they want to bind the people to them oh my God your salvation is not tied to any man your salvation is tied to your faith and belief in the truth I don't care whether you kneel to me or you lift me up or you bow down to me but at the end if you don't follow the message the way I preach it you will still be lost by the leading of the people and they deliberately you know he says by Leading the People deliberately into the scene of unbelief I was in Ethiopia and one preacher a very old preacher told us there was somewhere and uh this preacher said to the people hallelujah hallelujah the spirit of God is here now do you want to hear from the Bible the word or you want to hear from above so the people had to make a choice and everybody said above so he took the Bible and threw it away and he began above is him of course you begin prophesy prophesy prophesy and but at the end of the day you tell you now whatever is in your pocket bring it out this is about he's really after your pocket that is above above leads them to your pocket but above has always told the people repent or perish and the man of God Nam he came with a lot of um he came with a lot of money but you see the man of God Elisha could not take he told him go away with your money I'm not after it this message is the only truth that is not after your money God will use your money if you freely give it but this message is not after your money and by the way whether you give or you don't you will still go in the Rapture if you're the bride the only difference will be the levels of your [Music] glory and don't think that is a small thing also because if you don't give and you don't sacrifice and you stand for this message there is no way that you can receive a a one um higher Glory you will be judged for how you have used your resources you'll be judged meaning you'll give an account are you following me now so he continues here the nian doctrine was the corruption of the CL as they s political power among themselves while bism is the is the subject sorry while babism is the subjection of the people to their system of creed and worship in order to hold them now watch this carefully what is it that bound the people to the nominal church and thereby destroyed them what is it it bound them to the nominal Church to hold them there now watch this carefully say it was the Creeds and dogmas formed into church tenant I'll read it again it was the Creeds and dogmas formed into church tenants it was the doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church do you understand this is how denomination operates they will have resolutions from today we have resolved we shall do like this like this this thing they have resolved to do becomes the gospel truth the bride does not move upon resolutions the bride moves upon the word and the holy goers they were not given the true food and the word word they were given the food that came from idol worship Babylonian paganism wrapped up in Christian terminology you know wrong doctrines traditions of ideas for example they taught infant baptism it is not here in the Bible you see them with laries even the wish doctors have them you see you see them with scapular they say if you wear this you will go straight to heaven if you die it is not here in the Bible you see them believing in the Trinity it's not here in the Bible women preachers nowhere in the Bible it is all false doctrines which were started and and you know by this false Church system you know you see them you know confused in such a in gifts this one is shouting in Tong this one is praying this one everybody pray in Tong yet the Bible says when you are in the church tongues must be spoken to to edify therefore it should be interpret if you want to pray in tongues it's okay but at home at home in your own private prayers but in the church let your tongues edify us and it cannot edify us without interpretation but the false Church system refus for them they coin these things among them you find there are women wearing trousers and their pastors have told them it's okay yet the Bible says if a woman wears a man's cloth she's an Abomination do you know what an Abomination it means God looks at you and he speaks Abominations Abominations are on pulpits Abominations are ing in the [Music] church when they move like this every move is meant to make younger men lustful you know the way they dress that trouser it is an Abomination friend an Abomination stand standing in a holy [Music] place and yet it has made been made to be accepted now listen to me these are B this is Babylonian paganism wrapped up in Christian terminology and that very same spirit and Doctrine is Right among us all Protestants and it is called denomination nism is Organization no no no listen to this don't miss this humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby this posing the spirit you you don't understand what this means you know the spirit of nanism is a spirit of organization that humanizes the leadership of the church I have spoken I'm your pastor I have spoken it's a spirit of nanism we don't follow that we don't we cannot BET our life on what the pastor has said but we follow with our life and everything in us if the pastor tells us the word it's just like in the home if your husband always is the kind who just tells I have spoken just I am your husband you have to listen to everything do it that is the spirit of nism Pastor what do you mean you know there are people who like quoting the pastor is the husband of the church but the pastor has no seed of his own the pastor is a chamberline are you hearing me he doesn't you remember the chamberline who was preparing Esther and other he he was he he didn't have a seed of his own he was using the seed the only the one who the only one who had a seed in the house was the king and the only one who has a seed to give us life is the [Music] king the spoken word is the Original Seed so the pastor is the head of the church he rules the church that is true is the highest authority of the church the pastor is the head of the deacon Board of the musicians of all the offices in the church and the body but he rules the church using two things the word and the Holy Spirit not as his desire he is therefore I must not lead the body with my emotion no sometimes can you interpret that you see there is some sheep which can really make you mad and you can can I Chas this sheep and I tell them to go and look for another Pastor go away and I remember these are not my sheep the Sheep of Jesus for and he his blood are you not happy to know that you are the Sheep of Jesus hallelujah amen and Jesus told us as Shepherds as ministers we must serve in humility preachers and ministers and servants they are servants servants you are the boss the body is the boss some also I'm also part of the body we are the boss and our preachers our servants when you go in a restaurant and they serve you food who is the boss the one getting the food or the one serving the food the one going to eat said the one going to eat because you ordered for the food and you are going to be paid you're going to pay for it you are the boss praise God nanism let me proceed here finish this quote nanism is organiz organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby deposing the spirit maybe the brother can come and help come on come on up brother martin and help and help the brother and he says bism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible this is you know brother Mar be a little faster because I don't want to be cut here he says niol nanism is organization humanizing the leadership of the church can I speak lug and you speak English NM organization let let us human let us make an organization an organization then then they get a human being and they put him there and they begin all to look up up to him and they remove the spirit what he says is what we say what he says is what we follow but in the message we believe in the leadership of the Holy Spirit not in the leadership of a manism is denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible and right to this hour many of God's people are CAU in the snare of denominationalism and God is crying to them and he says come out of her my people that ye be not partakers of our sins that ye receive not of her plagues you see they are ignorant but if the Rapture should take place at this moment ignorance would not be would be no court of appeal from the Judgment of for being in the wrong ranks but I'm so glad brought me out he brought me out of he brought me out of denominationalism for the cl to organize themselves with one rank over another until they are finally headed by a president that is a manifestation of the Antichrist Spirit regardless of how wonderful and necessary it may seem it is nothing but human reasoning taking the place of the word are you not so glad Brothers sister that you can come here Amen on Sunday morning on Wednesday evening knowing you are not going to hear human reasoning you can walk into a message Church knowing you are going to hear God speaking to you and any person who is in the organized denominations is right in the midst of an antichrist spirit let me repeat that any person who is in the organized denom Nations is right in the middle of an antichrist system now let me say this and I make it very plain I am not against the people I'm against the system and by being part of systems they are receiving to themselves the mark of the beast amen that's why God has called us out this message is a calling out come out of my people come on that's why we should evangelize because we have a message that is calling them out out of their you know they may be perfect humanly speaking they may never have fornicated let me tell you brother if they part of the false Church system they shall receive the mark of the be you see why it is important for you to believe the message and you also see why it is important for you not to fellowship with nonbelievers by the right hand of Fellowship by receiving their Doctrine you receive the mark of I want to be separate hallelujah amen now listen in the message denomination and I believe that God has dealt in each age but did you ever notice that every time a church fall and as soon as they denominate they start failing right then and whenever they fail God never raises that church again it goes to the seat now now you remember there is a picture I had on the old church of the Bride tree you see these denominations came forming one by one by one by one by one but it all started as a move of God God was moving God was accomplishing his word but when they denominate they die God moves they they God moves you know how did they denominate the way we have seen and then they say this is everything we believe everything in this book is what we believe and we believe nothing else but for us as Believers of the message we don't have a full stop on what we believe we believe everything that God has revealed to our Prophet we believe everything in the Bible we believe everything more that God will reveal to us because we believe there is more in God hallelujah amen there is more in God and in the message when am I against organized religion these are some of the messages you can [Applause] really now if I judge and accept the word and see that that Christ died for me then I will ask for his life to come in and guide me and if his life is the word and he wrote the word how can his life be in me and me claiming to have the Holy Spirit and adding a Dogma instead of the word all right a Believer cannot add anything on the word it just wouldn't work how can I add a denomination when he is against it and showed it through history every time they denominate they die they die spiritually they grow members all right but spiritually they never go anywhere so have you heard that having a big group is not a sign of prosperity amen the church can be very big but when they spiritually after it organized it died right there the Holy Spirit left it there is no more miracles and signs and she just went on right into chaos let me tell you even Pentecostal these days they started in the spirit by the way God was moving among them the Miracles were reals wers were real but God left them when they organized and these days what they just fake Miracles are you aware even in America there were prees who were faking Miracles let me tell you Brothers where is God now I ask you again where is God now God is in the message of the hour they he kept on moving out moving out moving out moving they denate they die he moves and then he keeps on moving and where is he now he is among the people that are receiving the full coun of the world Amen the first well they fought for it he left them the second he left where is he he's on the third one what is the name of the third one where are we today we are at amen there is room room for everybody please don't let the devil make you I want you to understand what I'm saying where we are right now we are at the third where there is room for everybody when they denominated on the first one they died they said for us we believe only these things the Baptist they said they don't believe in the move of the Holy Spirit that God no longer does Miracles and blah blah blah blah they they died God left them there they have a big denomination but no life then came the Pentecostal and they also denominated later on they said we don't believe that New Revelations are coming we believe what we have already but we believe SS and wonders but they denominated when they took the system of man and the humanized leadership today have you not seen even here in Uganda how Pentecostals are now dressing like Roman Catholic how many have seen those pictures or videos if you haven't go and look for it even recently here they were very busy asking the Pres to give them land they dressing in Protestant bishop or Catholic bishop or they are born again they have gone back to their so they denominated and they died God left them the spirit of God keeps moving what does where does he move he moves with the word wherever the word is there the spirit is also wherever the believer is there the spirit is also and wherever Isaac went they are the anointing for the flowing water him and he says so let's all come to drink and I like to drink at the last well where there is room for every room for Baptist and the methodists and the Pentecostal and all of us string from the same Fountain I kind of like that listen to me Church where are we we are at room for who for all here we are not denominated here we welcome everyone anglicans Catholics Muslims Baptists Pentecostals Mormons all of them let them come when you evangelizing when we when you evangelizing don't just tell someone I'm Catholic now you want to preach to who with this message you can preach to everybody and anyone Amen Brother Joseph Brother Joseph you will preach to everybody and anyone not some I am Muslim okay okay even the Muslims we have Muslims who have believed this message we even have someone here who's ready for baptism a Muslim is she here is she here today raise up your hand if you're here right over there God bless you Sister yes sister evangelized to her yes they come oh we as message Believers can sing a song they come from the Easter they come from the landsar they come Sister Mary to Fe with the king oh my God if you receive this understanding say Amen they come from the East and West they are here from Catholic they are here from Anglican they are here from orthodox they here from Muslims they here from morons they here from Pentecostal from Deliverance Miracle Center they are from everywhere they are here why this is it is a well for everybody to that is why we are not a denomination amen you can't do it you cannot denominate this message take your Bible and and we read the last scripture here in in Luke chapter 14 hallelujah amen Luke 14:16 the the the ones read reading luganda you can read in your Bible just read in English listen then said he unto them unto him a certain man made a great supper and B many and sent his servant at supper time to say to them that were bidden come for all things are now ready and they all with one consent began to make excuse the first said unto him I have bought a piece of ground and I must need go and see it I pray thee have me excused and another said I have bought five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them I pray that the I pray thee have me excused and another said I have married a wife Amen brother Aron and therefore I cannot come so that servant came and showed his Lord these things then the master of the house being angry said to his servant go out quickly into the streets and L and of the city and bring in hether the poor the maed the C and blind and the servant said Lord it is done as thou Hast commanded and yet and yet is there is room amen and the Lord said unto the servant go out into the highways because there is room go into the highways the hedges and compel them to come in that my house may be failed I want to say there is [Music] room hallelujah amen at first they went out to beat them to call them there is room you have come out from wherever you have come from but I want to say there is room there is room for more that is why the Rapture has not happened yet you need to go out brother you need to go out sister and you reach out to somebody and tell them my friend there is something going on the Rapture is happening very soon people who know about this message and are joking around with it ah it will be a very sad time for them if the Rapture happens and you realize I'm left you will begin laughing and crying at the same time the Rapture has happen some of you called L unbelievers you like coming L to church that day you will come the Bible says I don't know whether it will be morning or night but I just hope it will be Sunday early morning and others will go and then you arrive at 11 a.m. today I've been where will I sit behind then you reach where the deons I'm not seeing them okay let me go yes the church is open maybe because the first brother who always opens had already opened by the time the Rapture [Applause] happened and then while you are entering you find another sister she's crying and laughing she's in the spirit and then to see another brother today people are not serious today they not serious only five people in the church and you begin to think you're spiritual before you know it see the people cry continuously there no and then your mind comes back you won't even ask anyone because you know already should I cry should I laugh and I'm so foolish and I knew about it I thought I put myself right tomorrow and then you realize is serious then you begin cry even if I cry I know what is going to happen and then you begin laughing at yourself friends people who know about this message and they're joking around it will be a sad sight for them the others will continue worshiping normally in their denominations that's why you will come all the way to church because you are seeing everything is normal in the other denominations in the other denominations everything is normal and then by the time you reach here that's when you realize things have changed things have taken a corner may God help you brother sister to be serious we a brother sister amen there is room there is room for you and I want to finish with a few quotes here in the message tting for life he says now many people begin to think on the subject of life and now feeling free and I have always tried to to hold to not hold things back never in my life knowingly have I ever called out a character meaning a person name I have rebuked sin preached what I thought was right but never disregarded any brother he could be just as wrong and I could be wrong too but regardless him being wrong don't disfellowship him from my fellowship with Christ with him we are brothers we should not disfellowship Brothers brother from another fellowship is our brother why because there is enough room for all of us hallelujah amen in the message absolute says and I see the word is the absolute they told me you preach absolute and it was really nice the Believers there were and I see the word is the absolute and I'm tied to it how many are tied to the word determined I will know nothing else but Jesus Christ and him crucified he had a reason for it and I'm determined listen to hold that reason no matter what anybody else says I don't disfellowship them or discredit them but I know what I'm tied to by the way this here is a key in the Christian Journey we are walking many times when someone doesn't see the way you see things you don't even by the way do you know even in this message people see different things different ways yes people read the Bible but each one sees it differently the same applies to the message not everybody sees what you see someone will tell you if you plate your hair you're going to [Music] hell and they're wrong they're wrong you can quote them the message but what happens some Believers some ministers will disfellowship them no you not a brother don't disfellowship each other where are we we at there's enough room for us there is room there is room in the greatest battle ever fought no matter how wrong they are let's not disfellowship or disassociate ourselves with anything as long as we can win a soul let's go in with a as wi serpents but and try to win every soul that we can you know if you are a believer of this message you remember the brother who came here and told us that he even went to the mosque and worn a soul how many remember that that it is only believe you know in this message we are bulletproof the devil can try to send his bullets of wrong doctrines it can't penetrate it cannot penetrate you will go and walk in a Pentecostal church if you a preacher and you have a burden for someone a friend tell you I I go to your church you come to my church sometimes they use that kind of things so brother because you want to win a soul okay I'll come to you on Tuesday good but you'll come to hours on Sunday all right then you go there on Tuesday and then you see theming anding you put aside the bones then after you come out of the church now you come to him yeah talk about good things you in their Church don't tell twist twist that point he hit it that was perfect pick the food then tell Church on Sund yeah okay no problem when he comes here it will be impossible he will come back brother Alan was telling me the other sister came but she just came and had me preaching and then at the end she asked questions she said I have three questions I had you mention William Bram I had also someone else mention William Bram I want to know who is this William BR number two what baptism I was baptized in the name of father son Holy Spirit but I had you mentioned in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what is the difference number three what was number three tongues is it wrong to speak Tong I heard some people I said good questions so she came to visit us but by the time she was leaving she didn't even want to go we were there because of her for two hours and I'm telling you she's going to be baptized hallelujah amen she told me she understood perfectly you see there is room we atob there is room don't be St go and call out somebody your friends you're talking to them minister to them in those fellowships around your home bring them in bring them me call them let them come to Fellowship let them here by the way even if they may hear one one word they will hear something it doesn't that's why I put younger men to minister in this fellowships it doesn't matter whether they have preaching for their first time they will say something which those Souls have never had before why because what we have is more than denomination it is more than organization it is more than religion Hallelujah we are gathering souls for the Rapture there is room for everybody and we are determined to do that we are determined how many are determined be determined to call them witness to somebody bring them in bring them from the fields of sin it's not only Sinners as part the things they doing they are sinners because they have no truth and I finish with that I hear someone say how come they Sinners because they have no truth that rich young ruler was was a sinner how many agree because he wanted a saor he said good Master what can I and he told him C he told him um you know the Commandments go do them I want to ask a question here how many Among Us have fulfilled The Ten Commandments perfectly since they were born raise up your hand that man was holier than all of you as far as the laws are concerned and the good works think about it but he was a sinner why he didn't have Christ and who is Christ the word so these people may be in the churches they may be so called they may sing they may do all things but if they don't have the full truth the full word they are seers and you need to reach them out in humility in love let us turn on our feet and I finish with these words as we stand the prophet says standing in the Gap now many of the people and churches musicians can come he says this is an open tabernac it's never been a denomination and God grant it that it won't it will never be a denomination because we want this to be a place where we have no law but love no greed but Christ not textbook but the Bible and then we do not have membership we have Fellowship one with another for all people all denominations amen amen everybody is welcome and we Fellowship around the word of God where everybody can feel welcome they can and principle the principle is we just love the Lord Jesus and we are not a scholarly group here we are just playing people that try to just read the Bible and put no interpretation to it outside of what it just says I wonder if you can just close our eyes as we are going to pray this is what we are here we are believers we have no LA but love no membership but we have Fellowship no Creed we only have Christ no book but the Bible and here we will come everyone to come but the Bible says how shall they come except if we preach to them and how shall we preach except God sends us and if you want him to send you like the service I preached on Wednesday you only need to let the call of fire touch your lips for him to change you to work

[Applause] the Lord bless you [Music] Church you may have your seats for just a moment I will not keep you long just those two announcements uh the first announcement is that we start as a committee last Sunday and we we were trying to make the budget I think we bit a little later and I think uh brothera you can stream this part there are certain people who are part of us and would like to uh to also get this announcements so we we we are a bit late in making the budget this year and that gives us a short time to to look for the funds that we need to have a successful youth uh so we are looking for uh 37 million Shillings uh this is the budget that we made amen amen um so I told the committee that we we are going to have to find this money we as a church no one will do it for us unfortunately I do not have with me here what this budget entails does someone have it is I think you have it can I have it brother just bring it up to me here so I can give you the details of that budget and I I see many are not here today so I hope they will be able to find this from the scen so the venue we have been asked for um uh 9 million Shillings this year we are blessed because this money that I've just told you the 9 million shs it includes almost everything that we need to accommodate our people it includes a hall which can sit up to a thousand people um the only bad side of it is that it's a little older Hall than the one we had this year but we are trying to work with the school so that they can so and also they will uh give us uh the uh the chairs all the chairs um they have two Flats one of them is for boys another is for girls hosts and in each they can accommodate up to 500 or more and people not sleep like goats last time you know like last time we give they gave us a hole and mattresses so everybody was just falling wherever they were but this time we have bed mattress so they will simply need to bring their beddings um and also this includes the kitchen dining areas um left out anything standby generator it includes Power grp Cleaners cu the school wants to be cleaners um security Personnel all those things so it is included in there in the 9 million Shillings so this is the cheapest you can find anywhere really God is with us to give us this uh this this place and uh I think it's a good a good amount last year some of you who don't know we were paying uh 45,000 per person per night to sleep every person 45,000 for the two nights 15,000 per night uh and on top of that we were paying for the hall we paid 3 million Shillings separate for theall so uh you can see that this year it's much better you're not happy for that you should be happy then uh music um Department is going to be taking up to 3 million Shillings no no no no not just say what I'm saying uh we're going to be renting equipment and um last the other place they were giving us but here we need to rent all the equipment we mean we mean the speakers and the monitor and microphones all those things that go with the sound this cannot work there the hall is much bigger what we have here cannot work there so we need to pay that much and then for food we expect 500 to 6 700 people and that would attract about 12 million shs um and um then the the stage lights 2 million Shillings curtain 2 million Shillings carpet 1 million shills interpreter interpreters Department we need also some funds um not only interpreters I don't know why you put interpreters for many other departments to to help depart the ministers I think 500,000 Logistics 500,000 shs technical department 500 Shillings Medical Department 200,000 accommodation for our visitors who are going to be 5 million shs um m 2 million shs that brings us to7 700,000 so we're thinking if we go squeezing squeezing squeezing may we may at least make bring the budget down to 35 million and so we agreed in the committee that uh the people um we estimated okay we estimated depending on the last youth camp we estimated that at least the the the young people that are coming will contribute 15 Millions we estimated that according to our last Youth and so then that leaves us as a church with 20 million shs to look for amen amen and uh the good news is we had about 20 I have the number here 20 we had 26 members of the committee myself sister Ros the aigas brother brother Joshua brother Eno sister P Brother Dan Brother Alan brother ranas brother Joel brother the Shams and stupa brother Marvin brother Enoch the Deacon Brother Martin sister Agatha Sister gud Sister Esther sister Esther moazi this is another one uh brother Roland brother Solomon brother Dixon brother Ivan um Brother Joseph and my wife so these people made Pleasures because we agreed we are going to be your example so the 26 people of the committee Ed a total sum of 5.5 million [Applause] shs that means an average each person give at least 210,000 each person on average gave 210 so and so we we want we would like to bring this burden to you as a church this leaves you all or us all now cuz if 5.5 is removed from the 20 so we need 14.5 million 14.5 that is so that's what that is the money we looking for and we need it from the church it's our meeting we are the one preparing it nobody's going to give us this money it's our but what you should not forget each each person is blessed in the meeting you have a reward because you gave and you made it easy for someone to come we are going to pledge now we are going to pledge 14 then you can wait to you after the ples how many who are saying we can do this how many who are saying we can we cannot do this all of us are saying we can do this so um I'm going to have H uh the brothers you know yourselves the ones who helped us last time stand up get the papers so that we can pledge that amount pledge as much as you can but pledge what you know you're going to be able to fulfill because we are going to have these meetings uh in January January um and so it means you have maximum two months to fulfill your pledge and I'm so thankful some people already paid this their pledge amount I spoke to Sister Dina also she she told me that uh she would like to pledge so I'm sure I'm sure she would pledge those of you who are online you can also take the pledges of the people who are online if someone wants to send a pledge you can take that um that pledge from them uh brother AA are you hearing what I'm saying yes so um while we are doing the pledges let us Brethren let's try to be brother done let's try to be a little faster so that we don't hold the people for long and um while we are working on that I also wanted to first of all appreciate you the church for your consisten in contributing TOS the land fund [Applause] uh we have not um forsaken the land fund project but I have something I wanted to tell you uh can I have that fire yeah no give everybody it you know it is faster if you give everyone papers they raise up their hands you give you give you give you give and then you collect it takes faster it is faster so what you do you um the person writes their name their pled amount and their phone number yes um so I understand um the brother did not conclude with the land fund report um so we have um he did not mention the offering bag they gave 13500 the total this week has been 7265 and sub total this one is the money we have given for 36 weeks 36 Millions 76 amen amen and um the total overall that we now have okay 20,000 has been paid on the floor this week so this week this same week 36 brings us to a total amount of money that we have in cash that even if we got land now worth this money we can go is 63 million shs 23,000 Breen The God Who has brought us this far he will accomplish this for us he will accomplish this for us and um I wanted to remind you we are looking don't forget our goal we are looking for 200 a minimum we're looking for a minimum minimum of 200 Millions a minimum of 200 Millions so that means uh sorry sorry we we now still need um 37 million is God able to do this amen God is more than able to do those who that God would not God has shown them in 36 weeks and other weeks we have collected 63 million we need 17 and 137 million this money we rent here next year Aug brother Joel is that up to August yes uh so 10 what was our plan let us gather as much as we can so that by August we buy our land but with the p we are going now we cannot do we cannot attain that goal unless we double our efforts Tri now to you Brethren who are not giving I'm about to take a microphone and give it to each individual and I ask you how much do you give every week I know people in this church who you can call poor but they they cannot fail to give 10,000 I know them but I also know those who you can say they are well of they don't even give anything now these Brethren are the ones um going to make us fail to hit the target some of them their idea is I can't give 20,000 small let me collect big sums of money and give 20 million go but it has been 36 weeks person who was giving 10,000 has given 360,000 you who is waiting to get a big miracle you have given nothing imagine it is a lack of vision I'm encouraging our brothers and sisters don't discourage your team leader they call you they text you by the way on the WhatsApp groups there are some members who are not even of this church but your team leader will send messages there and you will never cheer them you the members of the church you be some of the group members who WR are the ones from other churches who are supporting us I'm speaking on behalf of the group team leaders they are not happy they are saying you discouraging them give what you can the Bible says God gives seed to the so you cannot fail to have a seed to give God gives you what to give and then when you give God will multiply you and then you will get more to give if what you have is 5,000 and give consistently give consistently and you will soon realize we shall achieve our goal so in 10 months if we are collecting cuz I noticed on average if you take 36 millions and you divide it in 10 weeks I mean you divide it in 36 weeks that's 1 million on average it means every week we give averagely 1 million so we give like a million now it means in 10 months um if we keep giving 1 million a week that will mean we shall raise a total sum of um 1 million time uh Time 4 that's 4 million a month times 10 that's 40 million by the by the end of August no pressure for rent 40 million extra and that means we shall have made 100 million from from now to Aug now if we are giving the way we are giving when others are sleeping others are but if all of us come and we and we come and together and we triple what we are giving it means by the end of August we shall have enough money for our land because because we shall have um 6 78 we shall have 180 millions and surely I can tell you we will find land around that price or something like that by August if we triple our eorts you who is giving you I I I Tred to ask around let me ask let me just show you an example brother brother Brian God bless you how much have you been giving weekly 15 15 is it possible for you to triple it in a week uh it's not possible now is it possible to add it's possible to add and then you make it double not triple yeah it's possible he's is not able to Triple is able to double sister Monica how much have you been giving a week okay are you whatever you've been giving are you able to triple it are you able to double it uhhuh h Sister Mary are you able to double it no I'm I'm just you're not committing I'm just asking are you able to double it like the ability not the decision okay you're not deciding I'm asking the ability if you cut off some other things are you able to oh you're able to triple it double many people who are giving the on have asked I know they give and sister Grace you have been consistent God bless you for sister Grace she has never missed a week am is always the the number one there I know because she's in my group so God bless Grace but I'm sure you can trip what you giving most of us who have been giving we can double if we doubled and the people have not been giving you pay what you have not given for 36 weeks and you also begin giving consistently by August we shall buy our land but if if we continue the way we are like that when August comes we are going to begin spending what we are giving if we giving 4 million if we are giving 4 million uh we shall because every month we pay 800,000 it means we shall go down to 3.2 and that will make us go for another longer time and who knows even maybe the own of the building may say I'm increasing range because he doesn't want to make contracts so Brethren the only chance we have to bring this m to rest is to double our efforts and those who are not giving you start giving and you pay what you have not given and then cuz you know is 36 weeks and I tell you Brethren then by August we can be able to achieve our goal connes so so far the pledges we have the extra ples we have is 1.7 million 1.7 today 1.4 seven uh that means that is not for the land fun it is for the for the Youth Camp so we need a 4 14.5 5 yes okay now the church members already you are paying the camp fee because I was being asked are you going to be to pay camp fee already you are paying more than camp fee so that's not a problem you pay more than what you pay at least 200,000 and those who can't pay what you can not lesser than the camp fe uh but um the pledges those who have made pledges please fulfill them and I was telling the people if we do not raise the money by pledges we have nowhere to run we shall run to our land fund so if you don't give the pledges then we are going to eat up again on our L and this is your money this our money for our church land and um I I know that the Lord will bless you financially so that you can be able to give i' I've been I've talking to some pastors um elsewhere who it it seemed as if they were burdening the people financially this that this that the church is looking for money for land Building and someone would say why don't we leave the preaching and this Youth Camp and we just come for prayers all those churches who have had people give of course there are those who never give no matter what you say but there are those who cat the Revelation and they give consistently they support the vision they support the bur God blesses them and that's why I was telling you I I'm not apologetic when I say we are going to raise millionaires from our fellowship God is a search of hearts and and to become rich is not out of a lot of prayers it's out of giving if you give the Bible says you shall do what you shall receive so we still need pledges of 13 million shs towards our land fund uh towards our youth camp sorry so the Lord bless you with those announcements and um to you who has not yet pledged uh just pray about what you want to pledge and um the Lord will provide and then you will pledge and give God bless you you all dismissed the musicians brother you want to sing a song as we dismiss so we
