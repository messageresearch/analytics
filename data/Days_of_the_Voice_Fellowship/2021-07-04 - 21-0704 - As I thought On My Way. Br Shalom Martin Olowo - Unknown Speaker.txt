has given me the grace to stand before the saints praise be to god come ever amen i mean yeah uh this morning uh okay there's something that i want to say for us i remember some few weeks ago week in tennessee yeah i was lost for some good time and i'm sorry that when i was going uh i just remember telling the past and some few brethren uh and that's where i was that's where lockdown phoned me yeah but thank you for your prayers because the lord brought me that the lord speak to you come on now amen uh i want us to turn to our bible this morning afghanistan and we are going to read from the book of psalms together psalms 119 verses 56 you then you also read psalms 46 verses 1 hold on sorry you read sums so um you read stamps 119 verses 59. uh it says like this psalms 119 59. that i thought on my way and i turned my feet unto thy testimonies amen okay let us pray heaven father in the name of jesus may you come and break the bread of life to us yeah i'm going to remind you let me help us download jesus open our understanding and increase our faith but the bible says that faith comes by hearing and hearing the word amen i mean i believe those who are normally when we read the word i know we stand so you may be seated praise be to god yeah this morning i'm going to take my inspiration from the message as i thought on m okay yeah psalms 46 the priyana mukam reading the first verse summary lord is our refuge and strength our very present hope psalms 46 god is our refuge and strength a very present hope in trouble god is our refuge and strength a very present hope in trouble therefore will not with fear though the earth be moved and though the mountain be carried into the middle of the sea and strength the prophet says that the sun is believed that by the clergy no the sun is believed by the clergy by the historian that david cried out this when his house was being washed by soul but and he knew that when he went out of the door in the daylights there might be a spear or a dart an arrow driven through his back his hands amen and usually it's when men are in trouble that they turn to god that is that is human too when we are okay he thinks that by being fine or not having any pain in his body praise be to god [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that is the first thing they think of doing is calling on him praise be to god are you also like that this morning hallelujah he said that men always say agaman gamba now there is no god uh and i believe you have also met them is the name of the synchrony somebody will say there is no god [Applause] is [Music] god [Applause] but you will never receive god and truly because speak [Applause] then [Music] [Applause] praise be to god [Applause] with us every [Applause] unbelievers [Music] [Applause] so god has his ways of doing [Applause] [Music] i didn't know that i would even be okay i thought i was going to die and now this is the sad part of her story i'm telling you i was watching movie from [Music] still god gave her another chance to leave praise be to god i want the kind of spirit which is in the heart because sometimes even wicked people when they are in critical condition some of them start to clean their lives [Music] then they turned to god oh i choked on that i have had many people laugh and say there's no god but when they get in trouble that is the first thing they think of doing calling on him praise be to god that is the way it is we try to make on all kinds of promises we try to make god all kind of promise saturn but when we are in uh when we are in trouble but when we get out of trouble catholicism when [Applause] [Music] heaven father in the bible [Music] to which it is we have seen that when the when the when the family rejects god at the end of the family where the church rejects god is underway when the church is they get in trouble why would they not become visible when they would leave god for a season but rather i can't say that and get in trouble they would always scream out to god seemingly to do that look like they enjoy coming to the lord that is so quickly forgotten we have seen the hand of god enough in these meetings meetings we hallelujah hallelujah you say they easily forget that we also have seen the hand of god that's what we can say that we remember [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] again that god is our refuge our very present hope in time of trouble it is good to know god find god [Applause] [Music] it is good to know god children know the god of your father that is the god of your father but we are talking of you are god networking knowing that god whom your father get speaking terms with him while there is nothing wrong with him hope in the time of trouble wait we are and my god was jumping on the bed i heard her crying when she came to me no i went where she was and i asked her what is the problem she kept quiet i said it so i told her when you don't tell me i will i will i will kill you guys then she told me my my finger so when i shattered her trigger finger that this category could eat like here when you try to throw it it was just moving like uh it was just rotating i knew i felt so bad in my heart you don't know and at that moment i remember i sent a message the past i wanted to call uh brother peter because he's a doctor yeah because uh i wanted to ask first aid for it what can i do because it was in the night it was late in the night but i prayed for her my name is after praying for her when i'm out of my mind when we're getting problems [Music] like two months ago i had some uh all the this ultimate called deep hate that tube income i massage her around that [Music] but my brother and my sister in the morning she woke up before i woke up and when i woke up the first thing was oh how is the hand now i found that when she had thrown that clothes and the hand was okay did not even swell oh look around zinger was very okay [Music] [Applause] hope [Applause] amen [Music] there is a story here i know prophet he's saying not long ago i was talking to an evangelist and he said one of his strangest things happened one of the strangest another strangest thing happened came to me a few nights before to be served he said when [Music] i'm very happy to hear you say that to hear you say that have you ever been to church much well you're like the common kindness whether you say no sir i haven't said it i've been more or less born and said i was out on i was out on a little lonely road walking and i would have gotten hungry and i was out out of money era [Applause] and said he told me we got a colored woman washing dishes or cooking you might wash dishes for her or several words that is so heavy true and he said he told them i got my teeth well that's all right i don't care what to do i want to work well and and they say we'll feed you and give you so much fun so he said about two nights after he had been there just setting on a box box and saying that he had two men outside talking and he began to hear a real funny noise taking place those great big husky wolves man said jim we better get on down to the cabin for we may be blown off the face of the earth in the next few minutes in this in this story it's not just again but it's what happened the storm was coming amen and say it is alarmed and said it alarmed that there was something uh there was something wrong coming to our workshop praise be to god but said in a few minutes the lightening begins to flourish and said he got up and looked out on the window tonight [Music] and said he would do and he said what if it would strike this place within him within himself [Music] foreign [Applause] coming day i know for within the next few minutes this little cabin if that hole can stay in its path it will blow it into pieces [Applause] she said she drove down she drove down by the side of the old soapbox and he said i never had anyone pray with such coolness she talked to somebody that she would talk to before yeah yeah you'll get a new moon she said and he said she didn't seem to mind if the cabin blowed away again [Music] [Music] when it will hit another stone like that you see this young man he's giving his testimony [Applause] [Music] [Music] is [Applause] he had no foundation hallelujah amen amen amen amen hallelujah that's how that boy gave his life to jesus kept his words sorry praise be to god here the prophet [Music] so i walked it's a big story and i still have something some uh somewhere where i want us to hit i got my he said after all right praise you to god come on this way in in this very message gives us his testimony that they are trump jesus he went to hand he had gone for like a holy day with his family then he went to hunt he left the family in a cabin family he went in the forest [Music] [Music] that and here the storm was coming oh my god a good job and when and then you see that when anyone is lost any amount of time they get fever again [Applause] but the whole thing you can you start reading it from a paragraph 50 or not from paragraph only i have found a little place and pulled it in but uh and got me a punch point or something and they would have been in it till the storm was over he's saying where he left the family and where he was at least for him he had gone somewhere where he could hide himself but the family was out there they could not help themselves [Applause] but i couldn't think of them then they were going to die and i said i must get to them so i said i'm getting nervous now so i know this is the way and i'm going right straight this way and something kept saying god is a refuge and it is a present hope so i say now i must be cracking up and losing my mind and now because i'm here i'm hearing that in my ears and i said i can't be i'm going right i know right i'm too good once man to be lost he didn't believe that god was speaking today i kept on going and i said i know direction and i'm not lost and uh sometimes people like to kill themselves like that today [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] those who claim to be born again [Music] praise but when you're out there never really you are not preaching to them remember you are up only everybody wants to see them [Music] but let us think of our ways [Applause] this morning [Music] let me tell you one thing shall supply our brilliant all right but our health our profession is about faith comes from god comes from about you know this is a modern god is it's up to you to decide whether you're going to take the word of god or to go with the world his god did not stop him he did his best by showing him the world but because the boy was so much cannon you know people they are the one window they are the one when the world is preached see how there is that man's preaching again about me praise you to god hey that pastor thing that is righteous that brother i think is the holiest it is because you are canon because the swim god love rebukes and correct event this boy went with his possession again and everybody was so interested everybody wanted to be near him for him not knowing that because he had money because he had sold all his possession praise be to god then time came all those things went away heavens and earth shall pass away but my world will never pass away praise be to god when
