Hallelujah you are Al you are y [Music] we are reading from the book of Acts thank you musicians God bless [Music] you chapter [Music] 16 we will read from verses from vers We Begin from vers um [Music] 19 we're going to read through to vers 34 and when H is speaking about this woman who had a spirit of divination would have be on 16 but time we can begin from 19 and when a masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and Drew them into the marketplace unto the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach Customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being Romans beat them and when they had laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the Jailer to keep them them and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundation awaking out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas and brought them out and said s what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house and they spake unto him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house let us also read vers 33 and he took them the same night the same hour of the night and washed their stripes and was baptized he and all his straight away and when he had br brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God with all his amen amen be seated please I wish if if all of us can come this side since we are not covering the whole place so that I can be able to look on only on one One Direction I would appreciate that I would like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus uh it's nice to see each and everyone tonight and also nice to see sister Esther God bless you You' been in our prayers in our prayers and your entire family for amen so tonight by God's grace I am going to share oh this is Brother Joseph I'm happy to see you amen uh some you make sure that my microphone is a little louder than my interpreter people online usually complain on that okay so well I'm speaking on uh that verse there vers 30 and brought them out and said s what must I do to be [Music] saved says what must I do to be saved before we go to the word is everybody okay ask your neighbor are you okay are you ready for the word this evening amen I trust that all of us are ready for the word I know there are many of you online and um those who will watch the service later you can as well ask your neighbor are you okay are you ready for the word praise the name of the Lord the Lord is good and he is doing wonderful things for us uh and that's the main subject um so but tonight we are speaking on those words which this man spoke he said s what must I do to be saved I know brother bam preached on the message say we want to see Jesus but today we will talk about s what must I do to be saved so this was a question asked by the Jailer of course having being that the disciples had been CAU were CAU uh uh especially Paul and Silas for preaching Christ and there was this damel the Bible calls her a damel also B calls a you know she was following Paul and Silas and she had followed Paul for for a while and she kept speaking these words these men are the Servants of the most high God which show us which show unto us the way of the of Salvation so now it appeared that this Spirit actually Bible calls calls it a demon on vers um uh 16 and it came to pass as we went to to prayer a certain Dam possessed with Spirit of divination matters which uh brought her matters sorry which brought her Masters much gain by Soo saying the spirit he calls it the spirit of divination you know it was upon this woman and and she was bringing these her Masters a lot of money you know the spe of divination a very F Spirit you know and even today we still have them them and they pretend to be prophets some most of the things they say are right it takes the spirit of God to discern that because they will side to you and the things they're saying are right but of course they will meet heat misses as well but you see it's a spirits of divination and some of them can even use Psalms and they use scriptures and they they appear to be of God but you see it's a spirit of divination you have to have the spirit of Christ to discern with which Spirit someone is ministering so now this woman was actually speaking truth and she was saying that these are the Servants of God that teach us the ways of salvation but she herself was not saved she herself had a wrong Spirit upon her and so now when Paul looked at her you know after a while he got tired of it and the Bible actually say Paul turned and he cast out this spirit and he says I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ come out of her and and that Spirit came out of that same and when our Master you know getting money out of this thing they saw that they had lost now hope for their gains they they they now turned against Paul and Silas they pulled them to the market took them before the judge and the judge you know condemned them to be imprisoned and so they took them and and put their feet in the stalks yeah and so they were there the whole night with into the if this word will bring suffering to you or pain or accusation it is a blessing to you but if you are c as a thief a you know the Bible says way unto you because you have even ashamed but it is a blessing if you go through suffering for the sake of the gospel and of Christ you know the Believers we encourage ourself by singing and prayers and you know they were not singing and praying so that others don't hear them you know sometimes some people fear to express their religion to express their faith you come to someone you know in church and you don't want to say allow amen so that they will see you you know we must learn to say Amen you know so that let everybody know you are here let all the demons know you are in church let all your friends see how how a holy Lord you are never be ashamed of the Lord and of the Gospel amen I remember one time we had gone out somewhere in Ethiopia with my children and so Elizabeth I don't remember how old she was but she was a little bit fellow so we started now praying in the restaurant we were eating a meal and so I said let us pray and then I started you know I have a big voice so usually even when I do I don't mean to shout I end up shouting so I started praying dear Lord told me Daddy quiet people will hear you I said yeah let them hear me we are praying to our lord Jesus and I believe that's how we ought to be I hope that some of you when you go to restaurants you don't fear praying no matter where you are don't feel ashamed of your faith bow your heads if you are two do it if you one do it Praises unto God and the prisoners had them that's the point where I was and the prisoners had them they were not praying quietly or singing quietly they were praying until the prisoners heard them you know they prayed at home so they prayed in prison but if you you don't your life is not a life of prayer when you okay when you are in a certain prison or problem you cannot also pray I believe we should pray in good times and in bad times we should pray when things are going well and when things are going back and the Bible says this was midnight so they didn't sleep they were not cursing sing they sang Praises unto God so if you are in a Praises unto what situation and suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of the prison were shaken you know one thing I can tell you friends whenever you worship God or praise him whenever you talk to God and pray you attract him they were deep in the inner prison but the Bible says suddenly there was a great earthquake so that the foundations of of the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were open you remember on Sunday we talked about he that shuts and no man opens and he that opens and no man shuts amen that is amen the one with the Key of David praise the name of the Lord we know this is our Lord Jesus Christ amen when as they were praying and as they were you know crying and singing you know the prison doors were open amen when doors are closed for you just pray and praise God can we learn to do that just praying and praising God not complaining and looking for help but praying and praising God it opens all not some all it opens all doors and everyone's BS were loed and now the keeper of the prison that's when he he remember to wake up and he he drew out his sword and wanted to kill himself why because he thought everybody had escaped so instead of being killed he wanted to kill himself before they kill him he came running and fell at his feet and said s what must I do to be saved ask your neighbor what must I do to be Sav what must I do to be Sav and now this is the situation of every human being we always think there is some magic formula there is some ACT there is something we need to do to be saved but do you know what the Bible says nothing do nothing what must I do to be saved and they answered him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ believe on the Lord Jesus Christ I just pray that this will be so personal to you that it will get you to another level of your faith you know these days I'm really determined to get us to mature at a certain level of our Revelation to stop being babies in but we have to mature and these series of sermons are really you know pressing towards that because you see you find many believers who are so much worried about what they have failed to do and others are so much worried about what they supposed to do now the more you worried about you failing to do or about what you're supposed to do is the more you're going to be a failure in this work of Christianity you are not supposed to worry about those do ands you are supposed to worry about accepting what has been done for you already have you believed on what has been done for you already salvation is not a set of [Music] rules do do we understand what I'm talking [Music] about we were in the carja and some of our brothers excommunicated some brothers and the basis of that excommunication was that their wives were plating their hair that was the bis you know just like you see sister Esther here oh my young sister here you you know they they believe they're not supposed to touch their hair their hair is just supposed to be straight if you do anything to eat you a sinner and you deserve to be chest away from church and they disfellowship disfellowshipped these are believers so and and you find that they will believe they are the ones who have a right to put in someone or take someone out you understand what I'm talking about so we need to mature we are the end time church we need to know what we believe we need to know the the the the the importance of the message you see when we do we we will mature to such a level whereby we will be able to minister Grace to even the lowest of Sinners the ex they will be able to accept Christ and believe the message of this without an effort effortlessly let me ask you a question friends a sheep put an effort to make wool sheep sheep doesn't make an e to make wool it just grows on it naturally why it all it has to do is to eat the more it eats the more the wool grows but the question is if you begin beating this sheep until it produce wo produce wool oh you're not producing wool get out but you're not feeding the sheep and we are sheep of his pasture and we are meant only to be Eaters of the world [Music] the word will mature us we should desire the word we should have appetite for the world even when you come to church you must come amen Desiring you must come appetiz how do you do that by praying by waiting upon God by being expectant so when you come and walk into church even if you the only one in church you have enough eat the whole meal by yourself and next time you won't come alone you will even bring someone you know how to know that a church is getting matured they begin to get concerned you can't come to church alone you have to pick somebody amen but now when you're not matured you be like this a Sinners for us holy ones let us go to church and how you see your friend who is wearing a trouser said no this one is a Cena that one can even this one is so I remember the very first time I was judgmental like that sister was in Ethiopia and um this one brother which we had just baptized he he told me there is a sister I want to bring to you oh that sister is is filled with the spirit she's a prayer Warrior I want to bring that so you can share the word with her I said wow that's wonderful bring her so he brought her in the evening I was there with my wife and uh with with with her and and and and um and so she came when I saw her as soon as I saw her I didn't have glasses then so I just did like this in my heart I was like M what he told me is not true I did not know that he just going to waste my time why was I saying those words I was gaging this woman how she looked she was a painted she had cut all this things painted it lips were painted face was painted with earrings and and all those things as you know we do and so I looked I was seeing holdes through her she can't be a Christian and even I don't think she can believe because the message is very difficult so I I I was not appetiz to preach to her so at that moment I started just going around meing around speaking a few things here and there and she she CAU it because she was a spiritual woman so she said brother I've been fasting and praying and even now as I came I've coming from an overnight I've praying that God should visit me and God spoke to me and said he was sending someone from another country to me with a message when my friend called me I believed you were the one now I've come but you're just wasting time it looks like you are saying something it looks like you're not saying whatever you have if it is from God say it I believe it it looked like a rebuke I was so challenged friends I was from that moment I changed my perspective of seeing the message as a set of rules and I started seeing the message as a message of Grace and that's why I present the message the way I do because I believe this is a message of Grace not a message of and rules and if we see it that way you can actually get so much empowered and you can mature so fast whereby you will overcome the things that we overcoming before and that woman I preached to her for about 2 three hours that very night she believe the message and we baptized that that woman the following morning she was very busy interpreting for me in a Pentecostal church and through her the Revival started in eth and now there are hundreds of thousands of believer all started like that I want you to imagine you cannot be the one to put in someone or take out someone the jail asked a question that's why I want you to pay attention it's not just like any usual preaching I'm setting principles of this message I want it to understand I want it to be a part of you I want you to mature and then you will begin to see things different so I want you to see this man came to him and he asked a question he said s what must I do do you see that thing this man is a Jailer this man has been told to listen to rules they they brought these people in just like others and they told him keep them make sure you keep them suffing those are the rules he's used to and so he thinks everything is about rules everything is about dos and dos that's why he even wanted to kill himself because of failure you know when you see the word as rules and of dos and don'ts you the moment you fail don't even want to come to church you will take yourself Far Away From Grace you will go away from you run away from God when God told Adam of this fruit you should not eat and so when he did he quickly ran away from the presence of God because he was seeing the word of God as rules and of those and so this is why this man was asking what must I do he thought it's all about what he was able to do or what he was not supposed to do in order to attain salvation Salvation is simpler than how we make it salvation is simpler than how we think about it when the disciples looked at him they never did tell him to do anything they simply told him believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and you and your entire house will be saved hallelujah oh glory to God I wish I can overemphasize this so the all things I'm going to say today is all about that I just want you to hold on to every word so you see these disciples told the man to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ not to believe on what he can do not to do certain things to make Christ accept him you know Jesus Christ brother bam said some people say i s the Lord i s the Lord i s the Lord but the prophet would say no you never did seek the Lord the Lord sought after you when when they sinned in the garden of aen who who sought the other it was God seeking after fallam and his entire rest praise the name of the Lord amen and so we see it has always been faith in other words the disciples told him it's not about what you should do just have faith and that's the faith I want us talk about in Hebrews 11:6 but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek can we now read that again with understanding but without faith it is impossible to please him tell me what can you do that will please the Lord what coming to church dressing well speaking well doing things well there is this one man he was um he was a believer of the law we called him the Rich Young Ruler so this young man came to Jesus and he told him master who Master what must I do to be to the kingdom of God same question what must I do to be are you following me Jesus looked at him he said why do you call me good only God is good so if you understand the Bible he's trying to tell him you are saying I am God so Jesus confirmed he was God you're calling me good only God is good in other words I am good okay let me tell you if you think I'm good then you should know I am God and everything else I'm about to tell you is the word of life because God is the only source of life and so now he started telling you know okay you go and do the works of the Lord don't don't he said oh thank you I've done all those things just doing those good works since I was a child I have not committed without you I have loved God I have not stolen from any man I've not done this Jesus agreed with him he said yes you said I'm God so yes you've done all those things but there is one thing you've not done said what is it what is it go go sell all your riches give it to the poor come follow me now Jesus brought that in in a form of doing do you think why please just focus here do you think it was about the money do you think it was about the buildings and the riches he had it had nothing to do with all those things nothing completely but what was it about because even Jesus told him go sell the money give to the poor he didn't say bring to the church no so it wasn't about the money that he wanted what was Jesus looking for he was looking for obedience he was looking for Faith amen because even he said obedience is better than sacrifice you know you can sacrifice all you want but if you don't believe his word and you don't submit to it and you don't believe it all your sacrifices for nothing so he told him go sell everything give to the poor come follow me so in other words believe on me I am God so believe what I'm saying the Bible says the man went away s in his because he had great riches so now many of us are not able to have faith in God because of our riches what are our riches oh my the Bible says where whever your treasure it says where your treasure is there your heart is also are you following me chch hallelujah amen where your treasure is where your your heart is also so in other words if you see someone not able to come to church because of a deal somewhere that is their treasure you don't you don't you can't worship God because of something you can't believe the word because of something what that thing is becoming a God to you and therefore you you are unbelieving the word you are refusing to submit to the word because of that thing and therefore you have disobeyed and therefore you are a sinner you see how easy salvation it's all about faith it's not about works the things you do only show your faith or your unbelief I just pray that you go back and listen to these things afterwards because I don't know whether everybody is getting everything listen brother bam would come on to say stealing is not a sin doubt is not a sin drinking is not a sin prostition is not a sin and all these things are not a sin but he said they are fruits of the sin so what's the sin the sin is not the works you do the sin he says you have to first unbeli the word to do the wrong things if you are a Believer you cannot unbel the word if the word says um Thou shalt not commit adultery so you are going to hold on to that as the word of God you're going to believe it and because you believe you will leave it but if you cannot believe it you will go and commit doubt why because you don't believe this word so he won't judge you for what you have done but he will judge you for unbelief for being a sinner for unbelieving his word but he says they that are born of of God they cannot see why because the seed of God remains in him that's the seed of God I want to talk about today that seed of God is called faith when that seed of God is in you the Bible says there is no way you can see they that are born of God cannot sin because the seed of God remains in him hallelujah amen and if you have that seed of God in you it is impossible for you to sin and you will always please the Lord and he says without faith it is impossible to please him so then how are you going to please him by having faith in everything he says by holding dear his word by punctuating every word with amen by believing everything he says whether it is REM word or it is written word are you following me sometimes the scriptures written sometimes it's a spoken word but if you said it you should and that will please him praise the name of the Lord and that's why amen when he wanted that tree sorry that fruit from that tree and that tree could not that fig tree could not give him any fruit he cast it why because any man that does not believe the word or anything that does not believe the word is under a curse when he was on Earth he said because you do not believe me you are judged already but they that believe he says there is there for now no condemnation to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but they work after the spirit my you know when you get this concept the whole Bible becomes a new book you know the Journey of Christianity becomes so easy it is no longer a heavy y because Jesus said come to me all that Labor All That heavy I will give you rest he said my yoke is light so and the Yoke of the of Christ is the word to a Believer the word is not a heavy lad do I believe the word is light that's why I'm saying of Grace you have never understood the power that can help you to to drive your mot body under submission the word and so this is the concept I'm sharing with you he said without faith it is impossible toe for he that cometh to God Must Believe not should believe not might believe or may believe but must believe he that cometh to God Must Believe says what to be believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he that cometh to God must believe that he is that God is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek how do you seek Him you seek Him diligently you seek him with an intention of finding him you find that rich was seeking him but he never had an intention of following what he was saying when he was seeking the word when you seeking the attention of God and you want to know the will of God when he makes his will know submit to that will and he will reward you accordingly hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah the church is built upon that praise the name of the Lord and that's why he told Peter in in Matthew 16 Upon This Rock I will build my church know told us that rock was Revelation are you following me now that rock was revelation of what revelation of who Jesus Christ is Oh Glory to God that comes to God must believe that he is and he a rewarder of them that dently re the church is built upon the rock of who Jesus is oh my God how many I enjoying this tonight and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against so you see the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against a believer of the so you see he say here in the in the message the Rapture you see it is a revelation the Revelation is Faith you cannot have Revelation without it being Faith so you see it is Faith Revelation is is faith faith is a revelation because it is something that is revealed to you faith is a revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like to it was to Abraham and that could call anything contrary to what he had been revealed to him as though it was it wasn't so now listen faith that's what faith is is the revelation of God the church is built upon a revelation the whole entire body are you saved you will say yes how sure are you by what faith what is Faith by a revelation so it is revealed to you but what kind of faith is that is it your personal faith is it your human Faith did you know that human Faith fails it fails you can actually believe with your human Faith but then that Faith Can fail praise God you see we see that it failed once Peter had it and when he was using that intellectual faith and he said I will be with you everywhere but you see when they when the people came and accused him his faith failed he told he told them I'm not one of them what what was that was he saying the truth at first yeah he was sincere but that Faith he had was intellectual and that's why we cannot rely brother B preached a message of not leaning on our own understanding you can't debate the word of God you can't reason the word of God the word of God is to be believed you don't believe it with your own faith you believe it with the faith of the Son of God we will get there now see in the book of Ephesians chapter 2 8 it says for by grace are you sa through through get there get there get there fast Ephesians CH 2:8 don't miss this Ephesians 2:8 what does it say for by grace are you saved really Believers we need to have a pen and especially young people you come and done these scriptures so you can well I know these things are now you know they go online and you can go back again and listen I understand that but also it's good for you to have your own personal not while the word is going on God can reveal something personally to you and then you want to write it down so let us look at verse eight for by grace are ye saved through faith did you get that by Grace we are saved but not grace alone through so the road of Salvation is called Faith the highway is called Grace for by grace through faith you understand that and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God not of works okay let me first pause a bit he says you are saved by grace through faith but that not of [Music] yourselves is not talking about your own human Faith he talking oh my God I wish you get it he's talking about the faith that is the gift of God are you getting it now if you're not getting it just say Amen come not of works so you see is L any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained that we should walk in them now before I get into a little bit deeper on this we will go to Galatians soon but I want to read you a quote here and brother bam is speaking on the spirit leading you to believe but we know that the spirit leads you to believe by faith okay listen it says there first has to be a creation or cre to create a creation to make you long and believe in God and when it does as sure as you believe in that that shows there is a fountain of divine heing it's got to be and the Bible speaks and says that it is it is his it is his holy spirit that leads you you see why it is important for a Believer to receive the Holy Spirit if you do not receive the Holy Spirit you can never have the right kind of Faith let me put this way the holy spirit is the only faith that can make you get saved the holy spirit is the power to make you get saved is the power that saves you it drives you he leads you he guides you he shows you things to he he he he he pulls you from a level where you have been human level human faith a level where you attain superatural Faith to believe for the impossible when you receive the holy spirit all of you are have the same power to exercise your faith faith is like a muscle you see the more you exercise the more stronger you become if you don't exercise for a while and You Begin running you know what happens you know you feel you know the tingling in your body pain and Ms and all those things that he wasn't going to die until he see the Lord is Christ that same Holy Spirit speaks to you Hallelujah so here brother B is trying to show us that the holy spirit will lead you to believe in things that are yours and for you so you find people who exercise that they believe they believe for things and then they pray because they believe God will give it to them and because they have seen it it works they will go again believe for more pray and believe for it pray and believe for it and it will happen they will go back again Hallelujah he said the same holy spirit that revealed to Simeon that he will not die until he sees the Messiah is the same holy spirit that speaks to you Hallelujah huj when he speaks to you whatever he leads you to believe is yours is yours now that's why we say levels of faith it is not different faith it is different exercising of your same faith you will get it you believe for a bicyc you get you understand one will believe for five children believe for 10 children right it's the same Faith but you see it depends on how you're willing to exercise God is willing and is able to accomplish everything and anything we believe Hallelujah if we believe for our church land and we say God will give it to us that's what he will give it to us I've had some men say why are you doing that that land in this area is expensive you could go somewhere like how others have done and you go in some ghetto somewhere you know where is all the mess and everything and you you know just get a portion of L in a w land the money you have you can even buy I told him that's your faith that's your faith but if we are believing for big things amen if we believing for what the word of God tells us to believe for amen it is our faith and God is able to accomplish he is able to accomplish if you believe for a house of two rooms and I believe for a house of five rooms we all have faith it's just a measure that we have but the same Faith but how are you exercising yours okay I'm not just talking about faith as in faith I'm trying to bring you to an understanding of the faith that gives us salvation the same faith that gives us salvation is the same faith that actually gives us um everything else we need and that Faith let me emphasize here is not faith in Christ it is the Faith of Christ did somebody get it open your Bible I told you you need to go back and listen to this Galatians 2: 20 that's why I'm going a bit slow so we can catch everyone Galan CH 2: 20 if you can stand there with me it says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ live in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me [Music] okay interpret this this way and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the [Music] faith no no no no no no okay I live by the faith of the son of God [Music] yes you get it now is talking about the faith of the Son of God not the faith in the Son of God just say what I'm saying exactly because here is where the real thing is now I live by the faith of the Son of God not son of man Son of God okay let let me first pause there we have three dispensation of sunship okay the first son of man Christ as son of man he is a prophet a man on Earth that Ministry ended when he died on Calvary and then there's a second Ministry of him as a Son of God now as a Son of God is the holy spirit it began on the day of Pentecost and it continues on until the Rapture now listen closely here when Christ was on Earth he said who do they say that I the son of [Music] man not Son of God but so meaning yeah I'm a man I'm a son of man is a prophetic Ministry so who do they say I am that's why they said oh some say you're Moses others say you elah others one of the prophets you're just a prophet but he said but who do you say that I son of man you who do you say that I am yes I'm a prophet I am right now within my prophetic Ministry on Earth but tell me you my disciples who do you say that I am and one of them amen receed the Revelation receive the faith Hallelujah it didn't come from a man it was not his own faith oh my God I don't know whether you're getting this it was not his own faith you get it very soon amen what was it it was a faith which came from above it was a revelation which came from above it was a faith of God and he came upon him and do you know what he say he upgraded Jesus and he said you are Jesus Christ the son of the Living God so he said you are the Son of God you are not just a son of man you are a son of God he took him from one phase of ministry and he took him to another pH Son of God means holy spirit and means God himself but son of man means Prophet man on Earth you get brother M so now when he said you are Jesus Christ Jesus said who do you say that I who do they say that I the son of man am and and he said yeah they saying you're one of the prophets what about you my disciples said you are Jesus Christ the son of the living so in other words you are no more than a prophet you are God himself Jesus looked at Peter he realized this was more faith than what a human being can have when I said faith I mean Revelation this was more reation it was higher Revelation and how did Jesus talk to him back amen he said to him Peter amen you Peter Upon This Rock Amen he said he said Flesh and Blood Flesh and Blood meaning you Peter in yourself human has not revealed this to you meaning Peter this is not your faith as a man this is not your human face Peter let me tell you Peter where that came from God himself has given you this Revelation so in other words Peter what you have understood right now God has given you his own faith it's a gift which come from above and come upon you and he said Upon This Rock upon this faith upon this Revelation I will build my church and the church is built upon that Faith this is the victory that overcomes the world this is the way that we can live above our defeating you know things and and all these worldly things not in our human Faith but in the faith of the Son of God Amen which we receive as a gift which we receive from God that comes from God the faith of the Son of God I live by the faith of the Son of God if you understand you say amen I live by the faith of the son the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me of course we know that is also son of David that is in the Millennium is going to be as a king but Son of God here is talking about the Holy Spirit dispensation oh my God Amen oh my god wow I do not frustrate the grace of God for it is the righteousness come by the for for if righteousness come by the law then Christ is dead in vain this Faith enables us to believe in a finished sacrifice on the cross this Faith enables us to surrender to the lordship of Jesus Christ the Jesus we have never seen this is not our own faith this is you know our faith produces good works but this faith of ours does not save us from our sins that's why that Rich Young Ruler all the good works by his own faith but he had received the faith of the son the faith of the Son of God is something else it's the gift of God Amen that's what we see in the book of Acts chapter 2 he says repent and be baptized every of and ye it says your sins shall be forgiven and ye shall receive the what the what the gift of what of the faith of the Son of God you get it you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah I live by faith in the Son of God I live by faith in theol do you get it brother sister my my my my and there it is it said this it said this for by grace are you saved through faith and not of yourselves not your own faith it is the what the gift God and ye shall receive the gift of the holy spirit so you see why every believer must have it if you don't have the Holy Spirit you don't have the gift of God to make you understand the word to make the word make for the Rapture and if without faith this Faith you can never please God it is impossible it is impossible so now how does this Faith come Romans chapter 10 verse 16 friends you just B yourself in the word these things are so beautiful but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah sayth Lord who has believed our report so then Faith which Faith the faith of the Son of God which Faith the holy spirit so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God did you get it now now let me just I don't think I can explain it better than that let's just get into the message the P paman Church age and we read um quot there where brother bam is trying to explain this same thing I'm trying to explain acts 3:1 16 it says when Peter was asked how Mighty Miracles had taken place upon the crippled one at the gate beautiful he explained it like [Music] this and his meaning Jesus name through faith in his Jesus name has made this man the former Creer strong the for has made him strong yeah the faith which is by meaning from him Jesus has given him this man this perfect soundness in the presence of you all see there it is Jesus name and Jesus's Faith brought about the miracle everybody say Jesus's name and Jesus's Fai brought about the miracle Peter did not claim it was his own human Faith any more than he claimed that it was his own name he said that Jesus's name used in the faith which is from Jesus thank you now you're getting it amen oh my God this is so sweet he said that Jesus name using the faith which is from Jesus perform that great work this faith is what the Lord was speaking about in Revelation 213 it was his Capital his faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers Hallelujah he has given us his faith we live by the faith of the Son of God my my my my that's why we cannot fail that's why we cannot go to hell that's why we can be overcome by the world because we have his own faith it was not faith in him but it was his own faith that he had given to the Believers Romans 123 according as he has dealt to every man according to uh verse one the men are Brethren The Measure of Faith according to the measure of Faith Ephesians 28 By The Grace are you saved through faith and that faith not of yourself this is how I what I was explaining to you you see not of yourself that faith not of yourself it is a gift of God and it also says in James 2:1 my brethren notice he to is talking to Brethren this faith is for believers is have not the faith my brethren have not the faith of not in but the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ with respect to person don't he says don't Brethren don't have the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ with respect to persons in this paman church age where men were humanizing salvation having turned from the truth that salvation is of the Lord everybody say salvation is of the Lord having cast aside the do of election and opened wide the church door and their fellowships to any and all who subscribe to their tenants as long as never mind the word never mind word in this age of Rapid degradation there were still the few who had measure of that Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and not only use that faith in Acts of power but with those who dare to say that they were saved simply on the grounds of joining a church you can use this Faith which we have given Amen to command power to command the sick to be healed to command a demon to go are you hearing me is the Faith of Our Lord Jesus Christ and how do we get it by hearing the word of God listen they knew that no man could truly believe eternal life and the righteousness of God apart from the measure of the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ himself as today's church is filled with mental believers who end the Virgin [Music] birth shed blood they believe in it going to church and taking communion and are not reborn at all even so in that third age was the same problem and I want to say the same problem now human Faith wasn't enough then and it is not enough now it takes the very faith of the Son of God to drop into a man's heart so that he can receive the Lord Of Glory into the temple not made withu this was a living faith and brother bam says I live by the faith of the Son of God Paul did not say that he lived by the faith in the Son of God it was the faith of the son God that given him life and kept him living in Christian Victory Walking In Christ Living in Christ means living with the faith of the Son of God exercising your faith daily until you receive the victory no they had not denied that salvation was Supernatural from start to finish they kept alive the truth of his name and his faith and they were blessed by the Lord and accounted worthy of him that's why he says whatsoever you bind on us be found in heaven whatever you lose on Earth shall be lose in heaven that's why we have the authority to command demons and Powers that's why we have the authority Amen to bring about amen the moving of the mountain we don't even now brother says pray in the name of Jesus but we speak by the authority of Jesus and the things shall happen where do we even get Authority it's not us it's not even our faith is by the faith of the Son of God Son what must I do to be saved what must I do to be saved believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and when you believe on him you believe on him by grace through faith none of works that any man should boast it's a gift of God not of yourself is the gift of God repent every one of you Bap in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and he shall receive the gift of thehost there it is the gift of God and when a man receives it in his life then you are represent a representative of Heaven you are saved you have received eternal life here on Earth that's why it is impossible for you to say you're going to the rure the and the gift you don't have to do anything to get it you just have to believe this man believed that same night midnight the says he was baptized baptism is not an act of self is an Act of Faith that shows that you have believed and when he was baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ he received the gift if you don't have the gift of the Holy Spirit and you baptized you are too late you too late the only people I see in the Bible taking so long to receive the Holy Spirit how long 10 days 1 2 3 3 4 5 6 10 10 days not 20 not 30 not one month not two years you can't stay in church hearing the word believing it and you don't receive the it's impossible it's impossible the longest was 10 is more willing to give it to you than you are willing what must I do believe on the Lord Jesus chist so if you don't have the Holy Spirit even now I'd like you to stand up all of us that us stand and ask him to feel if you if you believe with all your heart if you believe with all your heart it's not something off from the moon or something we attain it is something that is here present with us and it gives to every believer maybe you've not understood everything maybe you can go back and watch this and um try to meditate on those words as you continue in prayer and consecration let us pray father in the name of our Lord Jesus we thank you because of this faith of the son of we live we not live by any other but by this faith it is impossible to please you without this faith it is impossible to leave without this fath this is the life and men have rejected the life and they have desired the darkness but there are a few people in this world that you that have desired for it and they've said Lord we want life and maybe there are some here who were not too sure they've heard the word they believe it may you give them that faith that they will believe every word and be able to have the power to to have the life that that shows that they father these are not just words these are inspired words that I believe have accomplished purpose for which been BL every heer and even everyone that will hear this before after rather Lord may you bless them and give
