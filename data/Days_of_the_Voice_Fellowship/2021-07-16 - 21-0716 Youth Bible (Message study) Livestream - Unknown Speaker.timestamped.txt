[10:10] okay so
[10:15] sorry can you say that again sister i
[10:18] think my network is

[10:23] well we hope that it will be good by the
[10:25] time we start sharing because we will
[10:27] need you also to give your contribution
[10:29] if it's not very good then uh you might
[10:32] need to text us
[10:33] if you are streaming on youtube let's

[10:37] but you can you can hear us good
[10:41] yes yes okay
[10:45] i hear you very well all right
[10:48] okay god bless you uh sister
[10:52] uh sister john are you
[10:56] mr joe are you now back on
[11:03] okay sister johan
[11:06] your network is not good today
[11:14] okay so i think uh
[11:18] we might just need to proceed as sister
[11:22] joe another question
[11:24] if if your network can you hear me now
[11:56] okay all right so she's requesting for
[12:00] uganda bible
[12:01] so bad okay i think you'll work on that
[12:03] with
[12:04] someone here so you can be able to
[12:07] ensure that we're gonna buy
[12:10] i noticed here also people are having
[12:11] difficulty understanding the kjv
[12:15] but i think you must get used to the kjv
[12:19] as much as you are also learning that
[12:20] we're gonna buy
[12:22] praise the lord uh who is not here
[12:31] oh uh also my brother john
[12:34] i'm happy to see welcome
[12:38] okay so i think we should get started uh
[12:42] with the as usual
[12:45] today is our first day for the ephesian
[12:49] church edward sister fortunate
[12:57] no no no she should know that she should
[12:59] be here so don't waste
[13:01] now like i said as usual
[13:05] whenever we are starting a chapter i
[13:08] always want us to have an interactive
[13:10] whereby each of you or each of us can be
[13:13] able to speak
[13:15] and highlight
[13:18] those parts while they were reading uh
[13:21] that really made sense to them
[13:23] and while you do that i'm sure that
[13:25] someone else will be blessed
[13:27] and we can always comment on those
[13:29] things as well uh
[13:31] polycarp republica did you give him a
[13:34] church edible
[13:36] okay john did you come with your no
[13:39] you forgot it okay you always ah there's
[13:42] no way you could courage
[13:46] what
[14:00] okay here's what we are going to do in
[14:02] our
[14:05] coming meetings if you leave your
[14:08] bible and your church age we don't allow
[14:11] you
[14:12] to participate which means
[14:15] we shall excommunicate you from our
[14:18] bible study
[14:19] because we want all the serious people
[14:22] we want all the people who are really
[14:24] serious because how can you forget your
[14:26] bible
[14:26] how can you forget your holy when you're
[14:28] going to dig
[14:30] how can you forget your your study book
[14:33] when you're going to study
[14:34] so i think we need to be serious how
[14:37] many forgot theirs at home
[14:42] what did you forget
[14:45] how how possible
[14:48] oh okay but you were reading you had the
[14:51] one that you're reading from
[14:53] good okay so john is new no problem who
[14:56] else
[14:58] okay only one person fine now i would
[15:01] like us to
[15:02] uh those who are online uh
[15:05] sister joanne bro sister aquilo i hope
[15:08] you all also have yours
[15:09] by the way there is someone else here a
[15:11] rebecca
[15:13] i do not know whether it is the rebecca
[15:15] here or another rebecca
[15:17] rebecca would you like to greet us
[15:22] rebecca sharon did greet us
[15:30] okay i don't know which replica this one
[15:33] is
[15:34] you just raise up you you just raise
[15:36] your hand if you need to
[15:38] if you are a new rebecca and you'd like
[15:40] to greet us well you see a rebecca there
[15:42] okay now where are we starting today
[15:45] where are we starting from
[15:50] from this side
[15:56] i may not finish the church edge book
[15:59] the the the the ephesian church age
[16:05] okay good good a good number that's
[16:08] really nice
[16:09] uh how many have not
[16:16] the ones who have not actually is also a
[16:18] good number so
[16:19] i think i think today i do not know i
[16:22] think people are becoming a bit more
[16:24] lazy
[16:25] sister kelo have you finished your
[16:28] efficient church age
[16:31] by show of hands i think
[16:35] somehow your network is not really great
[16:37] so
[16:38] it's kind of lagging a bit behind but uh
[16:41] i saw sister john saying she has
[16:43] finished
[16:43] a house it's always very important that
[16:46] you finish so that by the time we start
[16:48] discussing a chapter you're already a
[16:50] little bit ahead
[16:51] and you can understand what we are
[16:52] talking about
[16:55] okay so sister fortunate have you
[16:58] finished you are
[17:01] have you finished the ephesians church
[17:03] edge
[17:05] why this time you have been a bit lazy
[17:10] okay we are beginning with science
[17:17] uh okay can someone be ready to work on
[17:19] the camera please
[17:20] we need to have a video of each and
[17:22] every person talking
[17:24] so that those who are online can be able
[17:26] to see them and also follow us
[17:30] along uh it seems today the network is
[17:33] not good
[17:34] for very many people but we shall push
[17:38] ahead nonetheless
[17:47] okay so can i just choose where we are
[17:50] starting or there is someone ready to
[17:52] start
[17:54] okay but the job will start and
[17:58] while he does i don't i is are you okay
[18:01] there
[18:08] okay what's the problem
[18:15] can you go and help if you need to help
[18:20] okay we're having the other problem
[18:22] we're having a problem with the other
[18:23] computer
[18:26] so just give it a second uh-huh
[18:30] is it is it well now now i also
[18:33] understand that it is a sister
[18:36] brother okay sister akit joining in
[18:40] today
[18:49] so they could be joining by youtube
[18:54] okay
[19:22] okay
[19:26] okay we shall start with brother joel
[19:28] and we'll go
[19:29] on like these to the other side
[19:48] it's good bless you
[20:18] as he works can you refresh the page
[20:21] where you're reading
[20:22] for everyone page two
[20:33] as he walks in the middle of his church
[20:36] he is aware of the suffering of these
[20:38] people
[20:39] and he cares as it was the base
[20:43] of the captivity in egypt
[20:46] when he had their prize uh he who never
[20:50] changes
[20:51] still hears the cry of the oppressed
[20:54] as he walks a man amongst them
[20:59] never signifies
[21:13] but they suffer from him
[21:42] they were patient and committed
[21:46] committed all to him who had promised
[21:49] lasting perform peace
[21:53] in heaven for what they had given up
[21:56] for
[22:02] [Music]
[22:07] whatever we are going through god knows
[22:10] what
[22:10] we are going through he knows what his
[22:13] children are going through
[22:15] praise god here he knew what these
[22:19] these people in initiation they were
[22:22] laboring
[22:25] they were laboring all for all that they
[22:27] had to serve the lord
[22:29] that's what what was the main uh purpose
[22:32] that they are
[22:33] doing that's
[22:36] what we are also supposed to do
[22:46] [Music]
[22:52] hardships but god knows
[22:55] what you are going through that's what
[22:57] you say that i
[22:58] you know i know that works my liver are
[23:01] my patients
[23:03] so uh 12 patients that means enough to
[23:06] grow some some
[23:08] hard conditions
[23:11] because without without going through
[23:13] hardships
[23:15] then we shall not shall not uh we should
[23:18] our patients should not be
[23:19] proven but when we go through hard times
[23:24] then god will organize what we are going
[23:26] through
[23:27] our patience everything we go through
[23:31] we have to know that god knows what we
[23:34] need
[23:47] and trials are natural normal
[23:50] part of christian life there is only
[23:53] one thing you can do about them
[23:56] commit them all together judge not
[24:00] and leave their house out working
[24:11] it is a normal part of christian life if
[24:14] we are to live in life
[24:30] um
[24:32] praise the lord now uh
[24:36] god bless you brother and no one was uh
[24:39] hearing what he was saying right
[24:41] did everybody hear what he was saying
[24:44] okay so
[24:45] now there is a certain things that he
[24:47] had he has touched
[24:49] that i thought are very important
[24:52] uh you know the ephesian church
[24:56] by the way before we even continue to
[24:58] discuss
[24:59] the there is a part i would like all of
[25:02] us to understand
[25:04] before we start to discuss the edges all
[25:07] the things that
[25:07] i inside the church edges
[25:11] now i want to first ask you a question
[25:17] and this question will be the guiding
[25:19] question for us to be able to start
[25:21] to learn about the edges then we can be
[25:23] able to go into them
[25:24] because now we already that the poet was
[25:27] discussing is a very good one but it is
[25:29] already
[25:30] in the middle but we what we need to
[25:32] understand i want to ask you a question
[25:34] what do you understand when someone just
[25:36] says church ages
[25:40] what do you make of it okay we'll move
[25:43] quickly now we need
[25:45] each of you to give us your
[25:47] understanding brother
[25:49] brother joel what do you understand when
[25:51] we say the church agents
[26:00] uh the church of god
[26:04] in different ages okay that's a good
[26:06] answer can we have another one
[26:22] from what time to what time
[26:27] after some years after some years but
[26:31] from what time how god works in a
[26:33] specific period of time right
[26:35] but when did he start working
[26:39] because we are we are not specifically
[26:41] talking about the church agents
[26:43] the church edges the edges of the church
[26:46] so when did he start working among
[26:49] the church oh during the time of the
[26:52] church when was that
[26:53] do you know that the beginning of that
[26:55] time
[26:57] okay so this is what is intended for you
[27:00] to know
[27:00] all right brother marvin what do you say
[27:18] has been
[27:27] god bless you tell him god bless you all
[27:29] right brother buddy
[27:31] what do you understand what someone says
[27:32] the church agents
[27:34] what do you understand yeah quiet go
[27:35] ahead just continue proceed
[27:37] okay no you don't need to do that
[27:46] yes
[28:07] so you mean the church was like one
[28:09] church
[28:13] how many times
[28:19] different durations from what time from
[28:22] when
[28:27] to so where are we
[28:30] in now where are we in that timeline
[28:35] when the lesson called
[28:40] my my mind god bless you all right let
[28:43] us have you brother
[28:44] you yourself you the one who is on the
[28:46] camera let us have you
[28:48] okay when when someone tells you uh by
[28:51] the way you don't need to keep switching
[28:53] off the camera no problem so and now we
[28:55] need to understand
[28:57] what your your idea or your
[28:58] understanding is
[29:00] when we talk about the church ages the
[29:04] seven church ages
[29:05] what comes to your mind
[29:20] these leaders how do they emerge
[29:25] because there have been very many
[29:26] leaders and preachers and the men of god
[29:28] and prophets
[29:29] all through the since the day of
[29:31] pentecost until today so
[29:32] how how do they emerge yes
[29:51] of course there are other people help
[29:52] them but they are chosen by their lord
[29:56] yeah all right god bless you for that
[29:58] okay brother polika
[30:00] uh that when you hear the church edges
[30:04] what comes to your mind
[30:20] is using some different people
[30:30] different people to take
[30:36] sorry can you clarify on that and be a
[30:38] bit loud
[30:39] people are taking specific messages
[30:46] okay so you've now you've now introduced
[30:49] a new word
[30:50] gentile church so can we now say that
[30:52] these are gentle churches
[30:56] yes okay did you hear what i said
[30:59] are they gender churches or it is the
[31:01] general church
[31:03] okay so what's the difference between
[31:04] the gentle church and the digital
[31:07] churches
[31:10] uh
[31:16] yes
[31:20] all right wow that's very good that's
[31:23] very good
[31:23] god bless you let us have brother shame
[31:25] shame carry on from where he stopped
[31:28] uh he said that he used the word picture
[31:31] but i think he meant
[31:32] that they were symbolic to the charges
[31:34] that we had to come
[31:35] so can we say that uh
[31:39] the the the chat when we say the seven
[31:41] church edges
[31:43] it's not merely what was in asia
[31:46] or is it also that plus today can you
[31:50] carry on from there
[31:57] okay you can just bring your own no
[32:12] problem
[32:25] but in
[32:37] so how do we know which phase we are in
[32:51] okay so we can see certainly the
[32:54] conditions we are in now and
[32:55] the situation of the church the
[32:56] condition of the church but how
[32:59] do we know that the condition of the
[33:00] child that we are in now
[33:02] is the last the second the third or the
[33:04] fourth how do we know
[33:06] how can we know how can you convince
[33:08] somebody you are in the
[33:10] in the last not in the second well it is
[33:13] well explained
[33:16] okay and three yeah from
[33:20] you know the first half these conditions
[33:22] will
[33:26] do you want to give us a sample for that
[33:32] you just feel free to pick any charge
[33:35] of your choice explain the conditions of
[33:37] that child
[33:38] then you try to point
[33:43] ask the fact that it is a past time or
[33:46] it is the current time
[34:04] oh
[34:32] um
[34:45] the beginning
[35:14] good
[35:39] so in other words the condition
[35:42] of the last charge would be
[35:45] or the the last church there called la
[35:47] de caya would
[35:48] be that it is luke 1. so whichever
[35:51] generation
[35:52] that was luke 1 we can say that the last
[35:56] one
[36:02] yes exactly but the generation that the
[36:05] bible says that
[36:06] was luke 1 that would be part
[36:09] of the condition of the last church so
[36:13] friends when do you think
[36:16] was a time when the church
[36:19] was lukewarm do you
[36:23] even know what lukewarm means
[36:26] someone maybe join may not understand
[36:27] someone explain look one what does luke
[36:29] 1 mean
[36:42] yes exactly
[36:45] you are not you are not entirely in
[36:48] christ
[36:48] and also you are not entirely in the
[36:50] world so you are a mediocre you are in
[36:52] the middle
[36:53] you have part christ part
[36:57] world and that is being lukewarm amen
[37:00] so but by the grace of god he has in
[37:04] every church age a people that he calls
[37:07] for his name those that he has intended
[37:10] to call out from that church age
[37:12] so we have okay fine but i'll explain a
[37:15] little bit after everybody has given
[37:17] their view
[37:17] okay can you please proceed to sister
[37:19] peace
[37:20] your idea of the church the church age
[37:26] thank you for that explanation by the
[37:28] shame
[37:30] please if you can stop switching that
[37:34] off
[37:46] god sends different people too
[37:55] yes what is go what is the work of these
[38:02] messengers
[38:07] sorry
[38:11] okay
[38:15] you know you don't just need to to
[38:17] answer it as if you are answering an
[38:18] exam
[38:20] you are answering you to help someone
[38:21] else who don't who doesn't know what you
[38:23] know
[38:23] you know something also you've had for
[38:26] many years not so
[38:27] so you can explain it for sure in a
[38:29] better way
[38:35] that's what you know all right sister
[38:38] can we go to
[38:39] the next sister as well
[38:42] ah why are you skipping the the small
[38:44] one
[38:46] that one is not isn't part of the okay
[38:50] sister elise can you please tell us what
[38:52] you know about the seven churches

[38:58] well in the camera the camera is already
[39:00] seeing you
[39:02] you want to say something do you want to
[39:06] say something
[39:10] okay can we move to the next sister
[39:36] she has brought another new word the
[39:40] bride
[39:41] that's the one that none of you was able
[39:43] to highlight
[39:44] now remember that these are how many
[39:46] churches
[39:48] but all this one these seven churches
[39:50] the purpose
[39:52] is to pick a bride out of each of them
[39:55] in the book of thessalonians chapter 4
[39:57] first the thessalonians the bible says
[39:59] the dead in christ shall rise first when
[40:02] jesus christ comes with the trump
[40:03] sounding of the trumpet
[40:04] the dead and god shall rise fast then we
[40:06] which are alive and remain shall be
[40:08] changed shall be caught up to together
[40:10] with them
[40:11] and we go in the sky to meet the lord so
[40:14] there is that time coming
[40:15] where there is going to be a
[40:16] resurrection but that resurrection is
[40:19] the resurrection of
[40:20] who the bride when we say the bride we
[40:22] are not only talking about those of us
[40:23] of this generation
[40:24] we are talking about the bride which was
[40:27] being collected
[40:29] or being gathered from the days
[40:32] of the apostles and that's the first age
[40:34] ephesus
[40:37] those of abraham uh i i i can i can even
[40:42] put them under that age as well because
[40:43] remember when jesus christ came
[40:46] he they rose again actually they had
[40:49] their rapture
[40:50] they rose from the graves and and they
[40:53] they were changed
[40:54] and those who are also together with the
[40:57] believers of the first
[40:58] age waiting on the trumpet of god to
[41:00] sound
[41:01] so when the trumpet sounds they will all
[41:04] arise
[41:05] and then we shall also our body shall be
[41:07] changed these are realities the bible
[41:09] speaks of them but
[41:10] denominations don't but thank god we
[41:12] believe the bible
[41:14] and we have received a messenger in this
[41:16] generation
[41:18] all right brother okela i know you have
[41:20] a load for us on that subject
[41:32] amendment
[41:34] first we have one word
[41:37] it means that the same word is revealed
[41:42] in these seven chapters
[41:57] with a specific message
[42:14] passage
[42:38] another whole new idea speaking of the
[42:41] same god
[42:43] hallelujah the same god
[42:46] in every age it's not a different god
[42:49] that the god of the first age the god of
[42:50] the second age the god of the father
[42:52] no he is the god of all ages
[42:56] you remember how you know in that
[42:57] candlestick he saw what what did he see
[43:01] john what did he see he saw
[43:04] seven golden candlesticks or
[43:08] lampstands and then within that lamp
[43:11] stand
[43:12] was one like unto
[43:16] the son of man and he had in his hand
[43:19] how many
[43:22] seven stars and these seven stars the
[43:24] bible says
[43:25] are actually meaning angels to
[43:29] the churches the seven churches are you
[43:31] following me
[43:32] yes so every every church has one angel
[43:35] every
[43:35] church has one angel but
[43:39] all these seven churches
[43:42] actually have one that is standing be
[43:46] between all of them hallelujah so it was
[43:49] this one
[43:50] who was like unto the son of man who is
[43:52] he it is none other but
[43:54] the lord jesus christ he was the one
[43:57] standing in the middle of the
[43:58] candlestick meaning the candlesticks is
[44:00] what
[44:00] the church and now he is standing in the
[44:04] middle
[44:04] of them and he has in his hands
[44:07] which means even the seven stars they
[44:10] are in his hand he is the one who
[44:12] controls them
[44:14] so i love that idea that you brought of
[44:15] the one god is the same god that's why
[44:18] the teachings of the
[44:19] of all the angels have to almost be
[44:21] similar it has to be the same message
[44:23] they all had to believe one god that's
[44:24] what i was asking you brother isaac
[44:26] you see all these angels all these
[44:28] messengers how do we how can we tell
[44:30] that it is this one this is that one
[44:32] that the same god who said paul is the
[44:34] same god who said his brother
[44:36] the son the same god who sent martin
[44:38] luther is the same god who sent john to
[44:40] easily the same god who said
[44:42] iranians is the same god who said martin
[44:44] you understand so it is the same god
[44:46] therefore
[44:46] these messengers must all have the same
[44:49] same
[44:50] characteristics hallelujah so these are
[44:52] these messengers or these angel
[44:54] messengers
[44:55] they must all have the same
[44:57] characteristics or the same
[44:59] uh yeah
[45:05] not entirely the same message because it
[45:07] is different messages we will go along
[45:10] but uh they are they are those that are
[45:13] assaulted like one god the teaching on
[45:15] one god
[45:16] all those messengers have to believe it
[45:18] you know because that was the basic
[45:19] the basic truth and so they all had to
[45:22] believe in the
[45:22] in the in the in the god being the same
[45:25] yesterday's done forever
[45:26] all of them believed in god and believed
[45:28] in the power of god and the powers of
[45:30] miracles and the unchanging god they
[45:32] believed in the unchanging god
[45:34] so you can see that the messengers were
[45:37] in the right hand of
[45:38] of of god and god was on controlling
[45:40] them all through
[45:41] hallelujah amen brother john you want to
[45:44] say something
[45:45] not yet oh yes
[45:48] what is your understanding currently of
[45:50] the seven
[45:52] of the seven churches
[46:05] please can you repeat i think i missed
[46:07] you somewhere
[46:10] the presents okay the face is okay thank
[46:13] you yeah
[46:15] yes yes and
[46:18] in every church
[46:30] yes yes and does that mean that
[46:33] uh in that particular age there would be
[46:36] no other people that god would use the
[46:37] holy spirit would entirely use only one
[46:39] man
[46:40] to pass a message to people
[46:46] that's a hard one huh yes but what you
[46:49] what you answered was perfectly right
[46:52] but you see
[46:52] i wanted you also to add on this that in
[46:55] every
[46:56] one of those ages there will be other
[46:57] people that god will use
[46:59] but there will be one main prophet
[47:02] one major prophet but there will be very
[47:05] many others that god will use
[47:07] okay it's just like a prophet for
[47:09] example in the first age
[47:10] paul was the messenger god picked him
[47:13] to go and preach the message to the
[47:15] gentiles but does it mean he was the
[47:17] only one
[47:17] no there was peter there was all the
[47:19] other disciples they were still alive
[47:21] even at that time
[47:22] but guess what it was apostle paul with
[47:25] the revelation
[47:27] of the word of the hour at that time
[47:30] you know he had the final say on what
[47:33] was to be believed at that time
[47:34] i'll give you an example do you know
[47:37] that peter believed
[47:38] before paul because peter was one of the
[47:40] disciples of jesus christ
[47:42] but paul came much later so peter
[47:44] believed that the jews
[47:47] cannot that are the only ones to be
[47:49] saved and peter believed that the
[47:51] gentiles cannot hear the gospel and
[47:53] therefore i also believe that
[47:54] it's not even right to eat paul can they
[47:57] he believed it's not right to
[47:58] under jewish traditions it's not right
[48:00] to eat pork it's not trying to preach
[48:02] among a gentiles
[48:03] it's not right to for a man not to be
[48:05] circumcised so i mean
[48:07] the things that the jews believed peter
[48:10] believed as much as he believed jesus
[48:11] and he preached to him
[48:13] but when it came to paul because he was
[48:15] the star of the age the messenger of the
[48:17] age the angel of the age
[48:19] the prophet of the age god gave him a
[48:21] little more revelation than all the
[48:23] others including peter
[48:25] paul preached that you can eat anything
[48:27] as long as you're prayed for
[48:28] for it the blood of jesus cleanses it
[48:31] paul believed even the gentiles must
[48:32] hear the gospel in fact
[48:34] he said that now it is the time for the
[48:35] gentiles
[48:37] paul believed that uh whether you are
[48:39] circumcised or not as long as you
[48:40] believe
[48:41] you understand and they fought with
[48:44] peter peter was saying no brother you
[48:45] are
[48:46] me miss misunderstanding and you are
[48:48] confusing people
[48:49] but the paul said no brother peter you
[48:52] are wrong on this
[48:53] and god came down and confirmed it to
[48:55] peter that he was wrong
[48:58] when the came from heaven and told
[49:00] him you know to go and preach among the
[49:01] gentiles and also to kill and eat
[49:03] so i mean god vindicated in many ways
[49:06] that apostle paul
[49:08] was the angel to that age but there was
[49:10] also others that god used
[49:12] number one number two there were also
[49:14] those who were the prophetic gifts like
[49:16] agaves agaves was in the time of peter i
[49:19] mean paul and paul was a major prophet
[49:22] but agabus was also a prophet
[49:24] you know so that god will always use
[49:26] very many people
[49:27] all over the world in every age but in
[49:30] every generation there is that
[49:31] particular one he uses as a major
[49:34] prophet
[49:35] to that generation amen so i love that
[49:38] uh brother brother can you also give us
[49:40] your understanding i think it's still
[49:42] fine
[49:46] in my perspective what i understand
[49:56] is
[50:10] to receive its message
[50:16] in different times
[50:24] you're done so what's the main point of
[50:27] what you see
[50:31] a period of time what has given
[50:34] each other has given each
[50:38] church
[50:50] now you are summarizing he's summarizing
[50:52] everything the church ages
[50:54] is a specific or as an entirely a period
[50:58] of time that god has allotted to the
[51:00] bride to receive her message to prepare
[51:02] her for
[51:04] the rapture amen all right sister
[51:07] fortunate that's that was that's very
[51:08] nice that's a very good summer reaction
[51:19] from time to time what saw this
[51:22] happening
[51:23] because from the time of pentacles the
[51:25] church has been changing
[51:26] things have been changing so he saw it
[51:29] and made
[51:30] john prophesied something like that
[51:33] those so since things have been changing
[51:36] they have to be a messenger for each age
[51:40] for example right now maybe technology
[51:43] what
[51:43] so they would have to send some other
[51:45] messenger
[51:46] who can preach on those changes
[51:50] because let me talk about it
[51:53] before the last maybe let me say the
[51:56] second church edge
[51:57] maybe there's something that's happening
[51:59] right now which wasn't happening before
[52:01] so god didn't send a messenger to preach
[52:04] about things that are happening
[52:05] now which weren't happening before so i
[52:08] think
[52:09] god was looking at how the world is
[52:12] going to be how they
[52:13] are going to keep changing and sends
[52:15] different
[52:20] amen even you need to give a clap that
[52:22] was very very good
[52:24] now i agree with her
[52:27] that every age is different
[52:32] every age is different and the
[52:35] situations in that ages
[52:37] different ages are always also different
[52:40] so
[52:40] that's why god needs to send a messenger
[52:43] for every age
[52:44] to only
[52:48] look at the condition of that age and
[52:50] give like
[52:51] like there's a problem that's the let me
[52:53] put it this way there is a sickness
[52:56] a spiritual sickness for every age there
[52:58] therefore god has a good doctor
[53:00] he will prescribe the same
[53:04] the same medicine with the same healing
[53:06] power but a different draws
[53:08] for everyday sickness so that you can be
[53:12] healed
[53:12] hallelujah you even see him also using
[53:15] that same language in some of the ages
[53:17] for example when you were reading the
[53:19] the gender the
[53:21] foundation age he he says what he says
[53:24] that
[53:25] by of migo tried in the fire that the
[53:27] shame of thy nakedness do not appear
[53:29] and he also said he said that
[53:33] also by that also he called it in
[53:36] amharic they called it cool the eye cell
[53:39] that your eye that you may see you know
[53:42] i said it was like the medicine for the
[53:43] eyes
[53:44] so so god is really a doctor a doctor
[53:48] and he prescribes the medicine of every
[53:50] generation
[53:51] through a messenger of that generation
[53:54] what would happen to our someone who
[53:56] does not
[53:57] accept the message of the messenger of
[54:00] that generation
[54:02] living in that generation
[54:08] two people are saying the same thing
[54:09] what if you don't accept
[54:12] the word
[54:20] do we have let me ask a question
[54:23] do we have a different
[54:27] now we're talking about an angel right a
[54:29] messenger
[54:30] can someone be saved in a generation
[54:36] when they reject the message sent to
[54:38] their generation yes
[54:40] yes can you give an explanation to your
[54:43] answer
[54:44] uh they can reject each of the message
[54:47] and they will be counted by the
[54:49] revelation of the previous
[54:53] [Music]
[54:59] no what i'm saying is you can like
[55:02] let's say for example brother murray
[55:07] but if you reject his message
[55:10] you can and you're a christian i don't
[55:13] mean like predicting it
[55:14] but you reject it as a christian and you
[55:16] feel it's not good for you
[55:18] you will be counted upon the message of
[55:21] the previous fathers the forefathers so
[55:24] can we now say that uh when we never go
[55:27] out preaching and people don't believe
[55:29] they say well
[55:30] i don't believe it but it's nice
[55:32] continue preaching it you know oh fine
[55:34] no problem brother you are my brother
[55:35] you'll be counted in the other
[55:36] generation
[55:37] can we continue preaching like that way
[55:40] no no he is explaining
[55:48] but you won't continue saying grace is
[55:50] there you can't keep rejecting the word
[55:51] of god just
[55:52] because you know exactly now i need i
[55:56] need us to understand that principle
[55:57] here
[55:58] i want us to understand a principle
[56:00] praise the name of the lord
[56:02] god has a principle and he moves along
[56:05] with his principle
[56:06] all through okay whosoever believes him
[56:10] will
[56:10] not what but shall have
[56:15] now when jesus christ came in the world
[56:18] he told them what
[56:19] if ye were if god was your father
[56:23] you should have believed in me and even
[56:26] if you not have
[56:27] believed me but at least for my work
[56:30] sake
[56:30] you would have believed me these people
[56:33] were believers of another generation
[56:34] also
[56:35] but why didn't they believe him and
[56:38] where and what was his conclusion as
[56:40] jesus
[56:43] to them you are of youra
[56:47] he said of your father the devil and yet
[56:49] these people
[56:51] believed in the law of moses they did
[56:54] not ever eat any pork
[56:56] they did not transgress the jewish law
[56:59] they never
[56:59] they kept the sabbath they never coveted
[57:03] someone else's thing i mean they were
[57:06] holy according to the jewish lord we're
[57:07] not even talking about people we're
[57:09] talking about
[57:10] the the very priests
[57:13] the ones who were the preachers of the
[57:14] what of the law but when jesus christ
[57:17] comes to them and they don't accept
[57:19] him they do not see the message of their
[57:21] hour the message of their day
[57:23] he tells them you are of your father the
[57:25] devil why on the basis
[57:27] because they have rejected him
[57:30] now there is a very thin line here
[57:34] i agree that there are people in every
[57:37] generation
[57:38] that will always lack because this chart
[57:40] as you are reading you'll find out
[57:41] that these church edges lap over one
[57:43] another okay
[57:45] so sometimes believers of the other
[57:47] generation will come into another just
[57:49] like that just like that right
[57:51] so we have we don't know where the
[57:53] separating line is
[57:54] but god does but if one is a believer
[57:59] really believing in god with all their
[58:01] heart there is absolutely no reason
[58:04] why they would not see farther light
[58:07] more light
[58:08] when it comes and by the bottom says but
[58:10] what do they do they dominate
[58:12] and when they denominate what happens
[58:14] when they denominate
[58:16] they die whenever they denominate
[58:20] they die they denominate they die they
[58:22] denominate
[58:23] because their denomination cannot bring
[58:26] forth life it's only the word of god
[58:27] through
[58:28] the message of the hour that will bring
[58:29] forth life
[58:31] okay let me keep keep up with the other
[58:33] thought of uh
[58:35] of lapping over the believers of the
[58:39] other generation
[58:40] and i'll give you an example can you
[58:43] please open
[58:45] uh someone read for me acts chapter 19.
[58:53] acts chapter 19
[58:59] is someone there is someone without a
[59:01] bible yet brother
[59:02] where is your bible
[59:06] oh you are lester to open your bible
[59:14] from verse one
[59:17] hey brother where is your bible
[59:21] oh okay fine okay can you begin reading
[59:28] please someone who is okay john you're
[59:30] reading can you read kjv
[59:33] oh you're good okay let's
[59:45] and start certain disciples he said i'm
[59:48] children
[59:49] have you received the holy ghost since
[59:52] you believe
[59:53] and they say them to him we have loved
[59:55] so much as kindness
[59:57] whether they are being before we proceed
[1:00:00] are they believers yes why
[1:00:04] which message do they believe
[1:00:06] [Music]
[1:00:07] they believe the message of john that
[1:00:10] you know you remember john was coming at
[1:00:12] that time
[1:00:13] before the general dispensation started
[1:00:16] you understand
[1:00:17] so it was john trying to connect the
[1:00:19] jews who were in the other generation
[1:00:21] you know
[1:00:21] johnny came at a time when they they the
[1:00:24] message was lapping over
[1:00:26] so now he because he was he was
[1:00:29] connecting the ones who were in the law
[1:00:31] connecting them to the grace he was
[1:00:34] bringing the jews
[1:00:35] introducing jesus christ to them now
[1:00:38] jesus has already
[1:00:39] come john has already died
[1:00:42] he came died finished his ministry and
[1:00:44] these ones now are the believers who
[1:00:46] believe this ministry
[1:00:48] so and now the bible tells us that
[1:00:51] apollos who was at corinth and paul
[1:00:54] now who is paul the messenger of the new
[1:00:58] generation of the new
[1:01:00] age okay that god has set now to start
[1:01:02] the gentile dispensation all right
[1:01:05] so now paul was passing around there in
[1:01:07] the upper courts around there around the
[1:01:09] ephesus
[1:01:10] you see he was passing around this area
[1:01:13] and he found his disciples there that's
[1:01:22] true
[1:01:33] that they should believe on him we
[1:01:35] should come after him
[1:01:37] that is jesus hallelujah
[1:01:40] can you imagine that uh these people are
[1:01:42] even already baptized by a person who
[1:01:44] baptized jesus himself
[1:01:47] and now john is born is asking them by
[1:01:49] the way my brothers
[1:01:54] have you ever seen the holy ghost since
[1:01:55] you believed they said ah brother paul
[1:01:57] what are you talking about
[1:01:59] we don't even know what you're talking
[1:02:00] about huh the man that do we believe and
[1:02:02] we didn't hear anything about the world
[1:02:05] but we know all all about the repentance
[1:02:08] and the
[1:02:08] you know how he baptized by john he
[1:02:11] don't know the one overpriced jesus
[1:02:13] now once that happens then paul said ah
[1:02:17] now i know what you're talking about you
[1:02:19] believe the message but that message is
[1:02:21] now dead man
[1:02:23] you heard what i said didn't you
[1:02:26] the manner was coming in the in in the
[1:02:30] old testament
[1:02:31] every day every day
[1:02:35] every day and whenever a day passed that
[1:02:37] manner was no longer
[1:02:39] leaving it wouldn't decay and they don't
[1:02:41] even have some mangoes
[1:02:42] in it so which means what did god mean
[1:02:45] god was meaning
[1:02:46] that because you remember that is the
[1:02:47] jewish church and whenever we talk about
[1:02:49] the
[1:02:50] jews it is a type always shadow of
[1:02:53] what's going to happen among the
[1:02:54] gentiles spiritually
[1:02:56] so for them to receive the physical
[1:02:57] manner for us we are receiving spiritual
[1:02:59] man which is the word of god for them
[1:03:00] they received his command they eat it
[1:03:02] so now but that man i was not alive like
[1:03:05] like the whole week
[1:03:06] seven days a week no that man was every
[1:03:09] day
[1:03:10] they would go and pick another if you
[1:03:12] say ah me i want
[1:03:14] i love this one so much let me keep it
[1:03:16] so that i can now start from there
[1:03:17] tomorrow
[1:03:18] you know those ones do like my wool they
[1:03:21] want to keep the food and then they eat
[1:03:22] it
[1:03:23] in the morning because they are so sweet
[1:03:25] this chicken is so nice
[1:03:26] let me keep some i'll eat i'll begin
[1:03:28] from there tomorrow morning
[1:03:30] now by the time you go to check in your
[1:03:32] plate you'll find there muggles jumping
[1:03:34] around
[1:03:36] because it was there so you had to go
[1:03:38] there
[1:03:39] again and look for another one for that
[1:03:41] the fresh one for that day
[1:03:43] imagine that's how god put it so easy
[1:03:46] with the church edges when you lap over
[1:03:50] to another generation you have to pick
[1:03:52] another
[1:03:53] the new message you have to receive the
[1:03:54] new message for that age
[1:03:56] amen now we find out here
[1:03:59] these ones have come in and they are
[1:04:00] they been lapped over into a paul's age
[1:04:03] and paul is visiting them ah i know your
[1:04:06] problem you have believed the old
[1:04:07] message
[1:04:08] now let me tell you there's a new
[1:04:09] message what the other one i was telling
[1:04:12] here is another very good idea
[1:04:13] is that all these messengers as much as
[1:04:16] their message
[1:04:17] looked like a new but it wasn't entirely
[1:04:19] new it was
[1:04:21] the one would be the foundation another
[1:04:23] builds or need another builds on it you
[1:04:25] understand
[1:04:26] the other one this one did not come
[1:04:28] again refusing the other one no
[1:04:30] the other night later foundation for
[1:04:31] this one to come and be good on top
[1:04:33] so now when paul was coming he said ah
[1:04:35] yeah
[1:04:36] but that baptism was not wrong but it
[1:04:39] was
[1:04:40] half truth okay because
[1:04:44] now the baptism paul was baptizing with
[1:04:47] it did not only have the holy ghost but
[1:04:49] it also had
[1:04:50] repentance in it but the one of john was
[1:04:53] only the baptism of
[1:04:55] repentance you have you repent you
[1:04:56] repent of your sins yes you are
[1:04:58] going to smoke peace you're not going to
[1:04:59] drink yes you're not going to go to
[1:05:01] fornication yes okay fine no you come
[1:05:05] now go be afraid of repentance another
[1:05:07] one come
[1:05:08] you understand just deepening what i'm
[1:05:10] going
[1:05:11] but that was okay but that was only a
[1:05:13] little bit
[1:05:14] now when paul came he began to tell them
[1:05:17] now
[1:05:18] you now need to not only paint but you
[1:05:21] need to receive the
[1:05:22] gift of the holy ghost and remember you
[1:05:24] can only receive the holy ghost if you
[1:05:26] believe in the death and resurrection of
[1:05:28] jesus christ according to what peter
[1:05:30] said where
[1:05:32] in the book of acts chapter 2 someone
[1:05:33] read for me quickly acts chapter two
[1:05:36] just go back a little a few verses uh
[1:05:38] acts chapter two
[1:05:39] verses uh two
[1:05:42] chapter two verse number eight quickly
[1:05:45] quickly read it now
[1:05:47] who is there can you read
[1:05:55] in the name of jesus christ
[1:06:01] yes so he now tells them that they
[1:06:04] should
[1:06:05] repent by now this is before peter paul
[1:06:08] started even preaching can you imagine
[1:06:11] so no matter which preacher it is
[1:06:13] churches can be many but
[1:06:15] if they are all led by the same holy
[1:06:17] spirit they must say the same things
[1:06:19] so we find out here that peter was
[1:06:21] already a preacher before even paul
[1:06:23] started
[1:06:24] but the paul is now saying the same
[1:06:25] thing that peter here is saying he said
[1:06:27] the same holy spirit was in him telling
[1:06:29] him to tell them to repent
[1:06:31] and be baptized in the name of our
[1:06:35] lord jesus christ for the remission of
[1:06:37] their sins and that they should receive
[1:06:39] the gift of
[1:06:40] hallelujah friends
[1:06:44] can you go through that procedure one by
[1:06:47] one
[1:06:47] what's the first thing repentance
[1:06:52] the second thing the third thing
[1:06:58] you skip some things let us start again
[1:07:01] one repentance
[1:07:02] number two baptism number three
[1:07:07] remission of sins number four receive
[1:07:09] the gift of the holy spirit
[1:07:11] so now these ones in acts 19 in the ones
[1:07:14] who were at ephesus
[1:07:15] they had number one they repented
[1:07:20] they had repented number two being
[1:07:23] baptized in much water right
[1:07:24] yes but now did they receive the
[1:07:26] remission of sins
[1:07:37] [Laughter]
[1:07:40] how many say they did it
[1:07:43] they did yes how many say they didn't
[1:07:50] okay can we have two two reasons the
[1:07:52] ones who said they didn't
[1:07:54] receive the holy spirit i mean they
[1:07:55] didn't receive the remission of their
[1:07:56] sins
[1:07:57] you are the many people
[1:08:01] they okay those who are saying they
[1:08:03] didn't receive the the parts of the
[1:08:04] world
[1:08:05] they didn't receive the remission of
[1:08:06] their sins yes and why
[1:08:08] because at that time thank you
[1:08:12] who else you you think why
[1:08:15] you don't know okay the ones who say
[1:08:18] they
[1:08:19] did receive the box of the holy ghost ah
[1:08:21] of course the remission of sins is what
[1:08:22] i'm talking about
[1:08:26] yes yes the holy spirit i think wasn't
[1:08:29] there
[1:08:30] me i'm just challenging watch your sage
[1:08:32] yes you understand
[1:08:33] yes even during jesus
[1:08:44] okay that's good now but yeah you know
[1:08:46] when jesus died
[1:08:49] he shed his blood and his blood
[1:09:00] oh this is a very good and i'm enjoying
[1:09:02] it all right
[1:09:18] yes
[1:09:26] do you have another one yeah you don't
[1:09:30] have
[1:09:30] a point at all on this
[1:09:43] in the name of jesus christ were they
[1:09:45] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:09:47] no so we all agree on that so were their
[1:09:49] sins forgiven
[1:09:50] yes yes why
[1:09:56] they were forgiven
[1:10:03] friends what does the bible say please
[1:10:06] let us go back to bible
[1:10:08] teaching okay uh can i run a scripture
[1:10:11] here quick quick quick i find it
[1:10:13] those who are online what are you saying
[1:10:15] the baptism of john
[1:10:17] did it remove sins or not
[1:10:20] the baptism of john did they remain sin
[1:10:23] they didn't wash away their sins
[1:10:25] or not please please if you if you have
[1:10:28] a point
[1:10:28] just animate yourself and give us your
[1:10:30] answer
[1:10:32] okay sister against is saying no they
[1:10:34] did not can you please give us your
[1:10:36] reason
[1:10:38] my my my this is a very good one
[1:10:42] hallelujah
[1:10:48] i want you to read i'm waiting for your
[1:10:50] reason sister
[1:10:52] as i'm giving you the bible answer not
[1:10:54] my answer
[1:10:55] because if i give you mind it would be
[1:10:56] another opinion and then we can continue
[1:10:58] from there
[1:11:01] hallelujah can we
[1:11:04] begin in the old half if we begin the
[1:11:07] old testament
[1:11:09] uh huh you people are i'll kill you with
[1:11:12] verses i have very many
[1:11:14] countless of them someone whenever i
[1:11:16] mention a vast
[1:11:17] open week you read another one like that
[1:11:19] like that okay
[1:11:21] matthew 26 28 first someone opened that
[1:11:25] another open mark 1 4.
[1:11:54] repentance for four
[1:11:58] wait don't conclude
[1:12:02] where there are sins remitted
[1:12:07] i mean who was it john was baptizing in
[1:12:11] the wilderness and
[1:12:12] preaching baptism of repentance
[1:12:16] the repentance that they were going to
[1:12:18] do was the one which would bring
[1:12:20] forth the remission of sins but wait a
[1:12:23] moment
[1:12:23] that was not all of it okay because
[1:12:26] remember
[1:12:27] that the the remission of sins could not
[1:12:30] come without a sacrifice
[1:12:33] there had to be a sacrifice for the
[1:12:35] remission of sin to take effect
[1:12:38] that is why in the in the in the in
[1:12:41] acts in a well did we read about john
[1:12:46] no no that's 19 yes these people
[1:12:49] were believers they had repented because
[1:12:52] if you have repented you are
[1:12:54] a believer but they are sins
[1:12:58] we are not remitted
[1:13:01] why can you first read for me that give
[1:13:04] me that one
[1:13:05] as you are also giving me acts chapter
[1:13:07] two
[1:13:11] acts chapter two verse number eight come
[1:13:14] on quickly now
[1:13:25] which is shared for many for the
[1:13:26] revision of sins now listen
[1:13:28] this one is saying because jesus was the
[1:13:30] one to wash away their sins all right
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] listen does water wash away our sins
[1:13:36] does the water wash away our sins some
[1:13:39] denominations like the baptists
[1:13:41] and the oneness pentecostals the jesus
[1:13:43] only they believe that water washes
[1:13:46] our sins water does not wash away our
[1:13:48] sins
[1:13:50] water is only a symbol whereby you are
[1:13:54] symbolized
[1:13:55] or you are identified in the death and
[1:13:57] value and resurrection
[1:14:00] of jesus christ or about jesus christ so
[1:14:02] whatever john was doing was
[1:14:04] he was doing it in preparation mode for
[1:14:07] that which was going to come
[1:14:09] that's why acts 19 what did he tell them
[1:14:13] accidentally quickly now acts 19 what
[1:14:16] did he tell them what did paul tell
[1:14:17] those people
[1:14:24] john baptized yes it is true he baptized
[1:14:27] with the baptism of repentance uh-huh
[1:14:29] listen unto the people saying unto the
[1:14:32] people
[1:14:33] that they should believe in him
[1:14:34] hallelujah
[1:14:36] that they should believe on him which
[1:14:38] should come after him in other words
[1:14:39] jonah's gospel in itself was not enough
[1:14:42] to remit sins
[1:14:43] but he the bible says he was not that
[1:14:45] light but he did what
[1:14:48] he was bearing witness of the light i
[1:14:51] mean john chapter one
[1:14:53] he was preparing the way for the light
[1:14:55] to come he was bearing witness of that
[1:14:57] light and the light
[1:14:58] came only when jesus christ came so here
[1:15:01] he is telling them
[1:15:03] he was telling them to repent in
[1:15:06] pointing them to jesus he was telling
[1:15:08] them to repent in order for them to
[1:15:10] receive the
[1:15:11] remission of her of their sins which
[1:15:13] would come by
[1:15:15] the lamb of god which takes away here
[1:15:19] this is the one okay i'm still giving
[1:15:20] you more scriptures here
[1:15:22] all right okay luke chapter 1 verse 7
[1:15:27] someone quickly
[1:15:30] chapter 1 verse 7 and another one open
[1:15:32] for me quickly
[1:15:33] luke 3 3. now someone read for me
[1:15:35] matthew 28
[1:15:36] 26 28 and it says for this is my blood
[1:15:41] of the new covenant okay wait a moment
[1:15:44] for this is the blood of the new
[1:15:45] testament which is shared for many
[1:15:47] for the remission of sins the blood of
[1:15:50] the what come on now are you with me
[1:15:53] the blood of the world of the new
[1:15:55] convent which means does it mean
[1:15:58] where was the old covenant
[1:16:02] please can someone answer because there
[1:16:05] is a if this is a new covenant
[1:16:07] and a new covenant that has blood there
[1:16:09] must be an old covenant
[1:16:11] which also had blood
[1:16:16] the blood of animals the blood of bulls
[1:16:19] and god's sheep and all
[1:16:20] oxen that was the blood of the old
[1:16:22] testament that the priests
[1:16:24] were using that was the only covenant
[1:16:27] the old testament we call it a testament
[1:16:31] is a covenant
[1:16:33] and there cannot be a testament without
[1:16:35] blind there cannot be a covenant
[1:16:37] without blind so we notice a year jesus
[1:16:39] is saying that now
[1:16:40] i am giving you of course he was now
[1:16:42] symbolizing it with the with the
[1:16:44] somebody speaking also his blood his
[1:16:47] blood would
[1:16:48] seal and make and establish
[1:16:51] the new covenant and the new covenant
[1:16:56] was oh this blood of the new covenant
[1:17:00] would be shared for many for the
[1:17:02] remission
[1:17:04] of sins now do you remember the other
[1:17:07] verse in the old testament
[1:17:09] which says there is no remission without
[1:17:11] the shading of blood
[1:17:13] oh you don't know it
[1:17:17] oh can you open it quickly
[1:17:23] quickly it's in hebrews 9 22.

[1:19:06] child shall be called the prophet of the
[1:19:08] of the highest
[1:19:10] for thou shalt go before the face of the
[1:19:12] lord to prepare his ways
[1:19:14] to give knowledge of salvation unto his
[1:19:16] people by the remission of their sins
[1:19:18] through the tender mercy of our god
[1:19:20] whereby the
[1:19:21] dayspring from on high has visited us
[1:19:24] to give light to them that sit in
[1:19:26] darkness and in the shadow
[1:19:27] of death and guide our feet into unto
[1:19:30] the way
[1:19:31] of peace read me the next one luke 3
[1:19:36] 3.
[1:19:41] and he came in two and he came into
[1:19:44] all the country about jenna preaching
[1:19:46] the baptism of the paintings for the
[1:19:48] remission of
[1:19:53] unless you have repented so john was
[1:19:56] giving them only this
[1:19:57] the first state okay okay luke 24
[1:20:01] 20 47
[1:20:07] luke 24 47
[1:20:18] amen and that repentance uh those of you
[1:20:21] if you don't want me to forget you
[1:20:23] those who are on zoom i would be happy
[1:20:24] if you put on your videos
[1:20:26] okay and that repentance and remission
[1:20:28] of sin should be preached in his name
[1:20:31] among all nations beginning at
[1:20:34] hallelujah so can now can we now agree
[1:20:37] that it is his name that he washes our
[1:20:39] seeds
[1:20:39] yes can we say can you sing this song
[1:20:41] with me what
[1:20:42] can wash
[1:20:47] [Music]
[1:20:57] nothing bad
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:12] oh
[1:21:24] [Applause]
[1:21:25] i know
[1:21:28] [Music]
[1:21:36] hallelujah acts 238
[1:21:45] [Music]
[1:21:47] and another one acts 10 for the three
[1:21:51] then peter said unto
[1:21:55] every one them you in the name of jesus
[1:21:57] christ for the remission of sins
[1:21:59] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:22:01] holy spirit
[1:22:03] don't interrupt we know you want to read
[1:22:05] it after
[1:22:06] but now listen he says what is your you
[1:22:09] are saying
[1:22:10] then peter said unto them repent
[1:22:13] and be baptized every one of you in the
[1:22:16] name of jesus christ
[1:22:22] foreign repentance
[1:22:25] then baptism then
[1:22:28] remission of sins then holy spirit
[1:22:32] now read that one first then we shall
[1:22:35] conclude this
[1:22:36] point
[1:22:46] yes jesus christ continue our finish up
[1:22:50] do him give all the prophets which means
[1:22:53] through his name
[1:22:58] hallelujah whosoever does what
[1:23:02] believes in him so these people in acts
[1:23:04] 19 did they believe on him yet
[1:23:07] no also did they receive the religion of
[1:23:08] sins no so we can now go back and count
[1:23:12] they had they be
[1:23:16] no before baptism come on people they
[1:23:18] had repented
[1:23:20] they had been baptized and they spoke to
[1:23:24] them
[1:23:25] so now the new message now which was
[1:23:27] coming through the apostles on the
[1:23:29] specific
[1:23:30] apostle paul it was now saying they must
[1:23:32] say
[1:23:36] remember paul was saying he must receive
[1:23:37] the holy ghost so that's why they even
[1:23:40] had to go back in the water because that
[1:23:42] water
[1:23:44] was now going to give up another form
[1:23:47] the first form was the form of
[1:23:48] repentance but this time it wasn't only
[1:23:51] repentance it was also the mission of
[1:23:54] and we have found a remission of sins is
[1:23:55] where in their
[1:23:57] name in their name that's why they had
[1:24:01] to go back
[1:24:02] again in the water otherwise if it was
[1:24:04] only
[1:24:05] praying for them to receive the holy
[1:24:06] ghost or to believe if it was only
[1:24:08] believing that jesus is rose again
[1:24:10] and they don't need to be baptized they
[1:24:12] will simply pray for them
[1:24:14] are you following me yes but they did
[1:24:16] not need to only pray for them they
[1:24:17] needed to tell them to go back in the
[1:24:18] water
[1:24:19] you read there read there again acts 19.
[1:24:24] this is amazing
[1:24:27] yeah sure you will ask that but let's
[1:24:29] first finish this point
[1:24:32] from uh from four yes you can read from
[1:24:34] there
[1:24:35] please who is that man in the camera huh
[1:24:38] we need this to be in
[1:24:39] as interactive as as possible all right
[1:24:45] someone just hear someone reading
[1:24:46] without knowing where they're coming
[1:24:47] from
[1:24:48] so don't think it's an angel okay all
[1:24:50] right
[1:24:51] go ahead
[1:25:11] hallelujah and then when they believe
[1:25:14] what happened
[1:25:15] when they had this they were baptized
[1:25:18] it doesn't even tell you that they
[1:25:20] believed because already that's a mask
[1:25:23] so which means some want to be baptized
[1:25:25] before believing
[1:25:26] don't even equality baptism you will be
[1:25:28] number one on hell
[1:25:30] on the doors over here water does not
[1:25:33] wash away you says ah me my sins were
[1:25:34] washed in the lake of victoria no water
[1:25:38] is water
[1:25:39] my brain my friend my brother what is
[1:25:41] what
[1:25:43] water is water but also blood is blood
[1:25:47] it is the blood that washes away our
[1:25:49] sins
[1:25:51] and the blood of jesus is the only thing
[1:25:53] that can wash away our sins
[1:25:55] and remember jesus was not only left on
[1:25:58] the cross
[1:25:59] for birds to eat him where did he go
[1:26:04] jesus was buried hallelujah
[1:26:10] okay brother henry sister johan please
[1:26:13] make sure
[1:26:14] you you always mute your audio at all
[1:26:17] times
[1:26:17] okay unless you're going to speak to us
[1:26:19] okay now what was i saying what was my
[1:26:22] point
[1:26:25] sorry water
[1:26:28] yes water doesn't wash our sins it is
[1:26:31] only
[1:26:33] the blood that washes our sins and only
[1:26:35] the blood of
[1:26:37] jesus christ that is why a you
[1:26:40] when you are you have believed in the
[1:26:42] lord jesus christ as your savior
[1:26:45] then you must believe that he died he
[1:26:47] was buried
[1:26:48] and rose again but that is just by faith
[1:26:51] only but it should also be put into
[1:26:52] works
[1:26:54] you know baptism is not is more of um
[1:26:58] a fulfillment of faith okay
[1:27:01] just like a the apostle i mean james
[1:27:03] says
[1:27:04] show me your faith without your wax and
[1:27:07] i will show you my face by
[1:27:09] my wax so then he believes you believe
[1:27:12] by being baptized in water
[1:27:15] that one when you have a place it says
[1:27:16] what
[1:27:20] it shows what many things that you
[1:27:22] believe but really it shows your faith
[1:27:24] in him
[1:27:24] and ensure that you believe in what
[1:27:29] come on it ensures you have believed in
[1:27:31] one
[1:27:32] [Music]
[1:27:34] god bless you this one has the point
[1:27:37] baptism
[1:27:38] is symbolic just like the lord is supper
[1:27:41] is also
[1:27:43] when we eat that bread and eat that wine
[1:27:45] it is symbolic
[1:27:47] what what what does it mean if we eat
[1:27:49] the bread
[1:27:52] his body right and the the the wine
[1:27:57] but you know those things are also
[1:27:59] symbolic
[1:28:01] the the the the body is
[1:28:04] here also right here
[1:28:07] the one and the wine is where
[1:28:11] the holy spirit right here hallelujah
[1:28:14] so we eat it every day but we also do
[1:28:16] those things as symbols
[1:28:18] so even baptism water baptism is a
[1:28:20] symbol
[1:28:21] it shows when you you go under the water
[1:28:24] that's why it should not be just
[1:28:25] reporting a little water here
[1:28:27] and then that's just they're playing
[1:28:28] around with you and then they're making
[1:28:29] you
[1:28:30] laugh and then cry and stuff like that
[1:28:32] okay that's i usually call it a child
[1:28:34] naming ceremony
[1:28:36] it is it is absurd that big people
[1:28:40] educated the people they go to school
[1:28:42] for i don't know how long only to come
[1:28:43] and play with children
[1:28:47] it is it is it is true because i'm not
[1:28:50] sure your version what a baptism is
[1:28:52] supposed to be a symbol
[1:28:53] a symbol of faith a symbol of the
[1:28:56] barrier
[1:28:57] and the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:29:00] so how then can someone be baptized when
[1:29:03] they have not believed
[1:29:05] how then can someone be baptized
[1:29:09] when they have not been baptized in the
[1:29:10] name of our lord jesus christ because
[1:29:12] that's the name they must believe in
[1:29:13] how then can someone be baptized if it
[1:29:16] is smaller water because remember it's
[1:29:18] the body you can they bother you and
[1:29:19] then the hand remain up
[1:29:20] all the leg remain up and then they only
[1:29:22] put water here and they say we have
[1:29:24] they put soil only here and now we say
[1:29:26] we have married so and so
[1:29:29] even a child will look at you and love
[1:29:31] that daddy you have married this one
[1:29:33] yeah i bought it
[1:29:34] and only as little soy is here on the
[1:29:38] forehead
[1:29:39] you know they will laugh even the
[1:29:41] children will laugh so this is how
[1:29:43] the angels if the angels were to laugh i
[1:29:45] think many people are giving angels
[1:29:46] laughter all
[1:29:48] through the day that you are baptized
[1:29:50] baptized
[1:29:52] baptism must be deep imagined by you
[1:29:56] because it's a sign that you have been
[1:29:58] buried with
[1:29:59] christ and you have when you come out it
[1:30:01] means you have resurrected with him
[1:30:03] amen amen john you you read it there
[1:30:06] in acts chapter where is it somebody
[1:30:09] romans chapter six
[1:30:10] these are verses you must you know it
[1:30:12] should be on your fingertips like this
[1:30:14] so that whatever you just go you can be
[1:30:16] able to defend what you believe
[1:30:17] or else you look like someone who has
[1:30:19] been indoctrinated
[1:30:22] romans chapter 6 you can read from verse
[1:30:24] 1.
[1:30:27] shall we continue
[1:30:31] shall we continue in his sin that grace
[1:30:33] may increase or abound or remain
[1:30:37] god forbid shall we there was a brother
[1:30:39] giving me scripture that is now sleeping
[1:30:41] uh-huh
[1:30:42] how shall we how shall we
[1:30:48] how shall we that are dead to unbelief
[1:30:51] live any longer there are in
[1:30:53] no you know that is so many of us
[1:30:56] as the baptist christ
[1:31:01] don't you know that as many of us who
[1:31:03] are baptized into the name of our lord
[1:31:05] jesus christ we are baptized into
[1:31:09] therefore by baptism
[1:31:14] wait a moment we are bothered with who
[1:31:17] with him jesus christ by baptism
[1:31:21] into death it is not about that john
[1:31:22] reading his sister so and so but
[1:31:24] these brothers are recording brother
[1:31:25] john oh
[1:31:27] you brother all right so okay
[1:31:30] we are bothered with him by baptism into
[1:31:33] death uh-huh that just as christ was
[1:31:36] raised
[1:31:43] of life hallelujah just like jesus was
[1:31:46] buried we are parents
[1:31:48] just like elasti
[1:31:51] amen so you know someone was like when i
[1:31:54] bought
[1:31:54] i went in ethiopia one day i baptized
[1:31:57] someone in water
[1:31:58] and when i brought them out and after
[1:32:00] everything and after we
[1:32:01] you know went out to the dress and
[1:32:02] everything then later
[1:32:05] uh they told me said a pastor that was
[1:32:08] so quick i thought i was going to stay
[1:32:09] there for some
[1:32:10] for some time so that all my sins can go
[1:32:12] away
[1:32:16] i say i said i said oh no
[1:32:19] i did not teach you that path it's not
[1:32:21] your the water that washes your sins to
[1:32:23] begin with
[1:32:24] that was in your mind taught by those
[1:32:26] people out there
[1:32:28] you know it is the blood of jesus washes
[1:32:30] away your sins
[1:32:31] what i'm doing here is a symbol only a
[1:32:33] symbol okay even if i do it for one
[1:32:35] second it's only a symbol just check you
[1:32:37] in water and out it's not by praying too
[1:32:40] much
[1:32:41] it's not by making you stay underwater
[1:32:43] for too much it's not but you understand
[1:32:46] it's as long as it's deep water whereby
[1:32:48] you can be buried
[1:32:49] and out sometimes i've even used
[1:32:52] bathtubs bathtubs
[1:32:54] in a place where there is completely no
[1:32:55] water you know we
[1:32:57] others we have used a big tank you know
[1:33:00] we got a big tank and then there is a
[1:33:02] lot of water we just go in there we use
[1:33:03] it
[1:33:04] the bubbles do not send natural running
[1:33:05] water the bible says much
[1:33:07] water okay john baptized in
[1:33:10] jordan and at some point he baptized in
[1:33:12] the river eno
[1:33:13] because there was mass water there all
[1:33:16] right so
[1:33:17] i i'm sure at that time they did not
[1:33:18] even have the technology of making drums
[1:33:20] and stuff like that you know uh
[1:33:21] perhaps so we know that the the issue is
[1:33:24] not like
[1:33:25] running water you know some people make
[1:33:27] a doctrine out of that okay
[1:33:28] the running water i know is always the
[1:33:30] best you know
[1:33:32] always the best but if you can't get it
[1:33:33] and it's not possible to get it
[1:33:35] that means you'll go to hell you have to
[1:33:37] find much water
[1:33:38] and then you have baptized in there
[1:33:40] praise the lord so
[1:33:42] we find out we go back to our point that
[1:33:44] those people
[1:33:46] you know we are already believers but
[1:33:49] they had a message a new message
[1:33:51] over another generation so when they had
[1:33:53] it they didn't say ah
[1:33:54] for you for us to leave us we already
[1:33:56] baptized in the name of or
[1:33:58] we have oppressed by john even if it is
[1:34:00] not in any name but the one the man who
[1:34:02] please jesus come to think of it he's
[1:34:03] the one who has baptized us
[1:34:05] so please please please excuse us they
[1:34:08] didn't say like that
[1:34:09] but they said they didn't also say that
[1:34:12] uh you know what we shall be counted
[1:34:13] under the generation of gods will
[1:34:14] believe with john
[1:34:16] but they say hey this is like we need to
[1:34:19] know
[1:34:19] we didn't know but now we are realizing
[1:34:21] it is the truth please can you take us
[1:34:23] now
[1:34:24] they baptized them again in the name of
[1:34:26] jesus
[1:34:27] christ and they received you have
[1:34:30] skipped
[1:34:31] they received the remission of their
[1:34:33] sins and they received
[1:34:35] them so if you have not been baptized in
[1:34:37] his name your sins are still on you my
[1:34:39] good lord
[1:34:40] if you were to die today you would die a
[1:34:42] sinner
[1:34:45] you say you believe on him right but
[1:34:47] your faith in him does not count if you
[1:34:49] cannot be baptized in his name
[1:34:52] hallelujah amen and you see you cannot
[1:34:55] also say ah but you you see i was
[1:34:57] baptized in his name but if you believe
[1:34:58] before them
[1:35:00] it has to be a conflict it has to be a
[1:35:02] faith and a confession of
[1:35:04] faith you have to know you are wrong you
[1:35:07] have to admit you are wrong you have to
[1:35:08] admit you are a sinner
[1:35:10] without understanding that's why you
[1:35:12] don't place babies or else you would say
[1:35:14] let me baptize my baby by the time she
[1:35:16] grows she will realize that she was
[1:35:18] about present she's no longer a sinner
[1:35:19] no
[1:35:20] it can't work it has to be another
[1:35:22] somebody who can hear
[1:35:23] like you believe like you understand
[1:35:26] like you
[1:35:27] then be battered in that water like you
[1:35:29] amen in the name of
[1:35:31] the lord jesus christ and remember not
[1:35:33] just jesus but the name of the lord
[1:35:36] jesus christ once you have baptized in
[1:35:38] that name
[1:35:39] then the remission of yours of your sins
[1:35:42] takes place
[1:35:43] how by the water the
[1:35:46] impact of the blood it you know
[1:35:49] your faith pulls the blood your faith
[1:35:52] and the blood they come together
[1:35:56] because your faith is shown by water
[1:35:59] baptism
[1:36:01] and that's why some people could even
[1:36:02] receive
[1:36:04] baptism of the holy spirit before what i
[1:36:07] want
[1:36:08] why because god had already seen their
[1:36:10] faith
[1:36:11] okay so it is the faith that gives you
[1:36:15] the holy ghost
[1:36:16] but the faith without works is even
[1:36:18] those ones who were already baptized
[1:36:20] before with the holocaust before water
[1:36:23] they had to go back again
[1:36:24] to show their faith okay so uh
[1:36:27] but your faith pulls down the impact of
[1:36:30] the blood
[1:36:32] and it's applied upon you and then you
[1:36:34] receive the holy ghost as a
[1:36:36] confirmation and a seal into the body of
[1:36:39] jesus christ
[1:36:40] so you see why it is very important to
[1:36:43] be able to baptize
[1:36:44] yes for the remission of sins and for
[1:36:46] them
[1:36:47] before the receiving of the holy ghost
[1:36:49] hallelujah so
[1:36:51] some of you are already baptized in that
[1:36:53] name uh
[1:36:54] uh you know if you die today
[1:36:58] i'm sorry to announce to you but the
[1:37:00] place you are going to i'm not sure what
[1:37:02] about it
[1:37:03] you know you must really know you must
[1:37:06] really know
[1:37:07] if you want to go to heaven if you want
[1:37:09] to meet jesus
[1:37:10] if you don't want to go to hell when i
[1:37:12] receive this revelation let me tell you
[1:37:14] me i was a priest's son
[1:37:16] i had already been baptized by

[1:44:53] hallelujah end of the troubles
[1:44:56] and cares of the storyline
[1:45:00] hallelujah
[1:45:06] all right now can we proceed
[1:45:12] i tell you when you talk about those
[1:45:14] things we just get carried away
[1:45:18] i would like us to find a place where we
[1:45:20] can i don't know are we just going to
[1:45:22] stop on the introduction today
[1:45:24] because there is something that
[1:45:28] came up and we discussed that someone
[1:45:30] was saying that
[1:45:32] when we don't go to heaven or rather
[1:45:35] when believers
[1:45:36] go into another age they believe the
[1:45:38] message of that age
[1:45:40] others were saying no even if they don't
[1:45:42] believe the message of that age
[1:45:44] they can go to heaven by believing they
[1:45:45] met their former message
[1:45:47] even when they're in another age and
[1:45:49] what i wanted to show you
[1:45:50] by acts 19 that these people believed
[1:45:53] but when they came into another age they
[1:45:56] also had to believe the message of that
[1:45:58] age also
[1:45:59] okay that's the standard operating
[1:46:03] procedure of god hallelujah
[1:46:06] that is the s of b of god
[1:46:10] yes then the rest those who
[1:46:14] are left over and those who will come in
[1:46:15] another age that's up to go to judge
[1:46:17] okay it's not yours
[1:46:18] my work is to tell everyone that without
[1:46:21] you believing the message of this age
[1:46:23] you are going nowhere
[1:46:26] in every generation god sent messengers
[1:46:29] with a message
[1:46:30] and their message was the only provided
[1:46:34] way
[1:46:34] of god for the people to escape
[1:46:39] judgment the judgment of god in that age
[1:46:42] like there is of noah i can continue on
[1:46:44] and on and on and on
[1:46:46] you see so even in our age we have
[1:46:48] received a message
[1:46:50] we call it the end time message
[1:46:53] it's almost sometimes we call it the
[1:46:55] message of the hour because in
[1:46:57] every hour there is a message and what
[1:47:00] is that message what how does it come
[1:47:02] almost 37 someone victory amos chapter 3
[1:47:05] verse 7. almost chapter three verse
[1:47:08] seven
[1:47:08] show it to me quickly almost three seven
[1:47:10] what does it say
[1:47:12] in every age there must be a message but
[1:47:15] that means it doesn't just come from
[1:47:16] heaven
[1:47:17] and drop on the ground it doesn't come
[1:47:19] by angels with wings
[1:47:20] it also does not come by denominations
[1:47:22] or by church denominations
[1:47:24] no how does it come read it for me
[1:47:28] surely the lord will do nothing
[1:47:31] but he revealed
[1:47:35] surely the lord god will do nothing
[1:47:40] but that what does it do his secret
[1:47:43] unto his servant so if he doesn't reveal
[1:47:48] his secrets to the prophets there is
[1:47:50] nothing going to happen and no one will
[1:47:52] know nothing
[1:47:53] so if there is going to be a message in
[1:47:56] any age
[1:47:57] there must be a prophet center of god
[1:47:59] not prophets
[1:48:01] in our generation you notice how god
[1:48:03] works
[1:48:04] in every generation there has been one
[1:48:06] major prophet one major prophet one
[1:48:07] major prophet one major prophet you
[1:48:08] understand
[1:48:10] and that one major prophet by him all
[1:48:12] the others receive the inspiration
[1:48:15] it doesn't mean that that major prophet
[1:48:16] will preach everything in detail but he
[1:48:18] will
[1:48:19] throw the light in that generation and
[1:48:21] the other prophet or the other preachers
[1:48:23] in that generation will take it up and
[1:48:24] break it down for the people
[1:48:26] hallelujah so uh but of course by the
[1:48:30] inspiration of that
[1:48:31] prophet of the age hallelujah so now
[1:48:38] the reason why i wanted us to know this
[1:48:39] because we are now starting the church
[1:48:41] ages
[1:48:42] we have gone through the patmos vision
[1:48:45] we have gone through the revelation of
[1:48:46] jesus christ we now know about one god
[1:48:49] we now know about uh john and the
[1:48:52] message that came to him and everything
[1:48:53] god was using
[1:48:54] uh how god introduced himself to him and
[1:48:56] everything
[1:48:58] now we want to start to know
[1:49:01] how god was revealing himself
[1:49:06] to the edges how he came
[1:49:09] so we we now know that the ages are
[1:49:11] seven
[1:49:12] yes and these are edges like that's why
[1:49:15] it is called edges not churches ages
[1:49:19] of the same church because if you say
[1:49:21] seven churches
[1:49:22] like it says in the book of revelation
[1:49:24] people get confused
[1:49:25] it is not really seven churches because
[1:49:27] jesus has only
[1:49:29] one church but indeed here is one part i
[1:49:31] don't want you to miss
[1:49:34] these seven churches were surely
[1:49:36] physically there
[1:49:37] in asia minor even today
[1:49:40] some of those places some of those sites
[1:49:42] can be found
[1:49:44] here in the present-day turkey yes
[1:49:48] talk about the care talk about
[1:49:52] philadelphia talk about sardis
[1:49:56] talk about there's a common one here
[1:49:58] that they always talk about
[1:50:00] [Music]
[1:50:02] vegamos you know what else
[1:50:07] huh
[1:50:10] okay what else
[1:50:14] philadelphia we already talked about
[1:50:16] that brother you are not you're not
[1:50:17] attentive
[1:50:19] yeah sad is tatira
[1:50:22] pegamos all these church a churches
[1:50:27] like you see for example like today here
[1:50:29] in uganda
[1:50:30] namugungo
[1:50:35] give me blessings come on
[1:51:03] some of you can also bring kaimusi huh
[1:51:06] you can break a sumo huh
[1:51:07] you can bring a those of you in uaa you
[1:51:11] can also talk about sahaja
[1:51:13] yoga awaksa if you're in ethiopia
[1:51:18] at this abba you know this we have
[1:51:20] physical places
[1:51:22] okay these were physical places
[1:51:26] and these physical places were having
[1:51:30] churches
[1:51:32] so for example the church in a number of
[1:51:34] what i would say
[1:51:35] the church in namgoong the church in
[1:51:38] kaimusi the church in the church
[1:51:42] you understand the church in now
[1:51:46] all these churches
[1:51:49] were not there were very many in asia
[1:51:52] minor
[1:51:53] but the spirit of god only picked how
[1:51:55] many
[1:51:57] seven and left out all the others
[1:52:00] why yes my sisters
[1:52:05] yes all of them that is also one of the
[1:52:08] reasons we are able to know that these
[1:52:10] are gentile churches not jewish churches
[1:52:13] because they were among the gentiles
[1:52:15] people nations
[1:52:18] so uh
[1:52:21] one thing i want you to another thing i
[1:52:23] also want you to understand
[1:52:24] before we continue studying the details
[1:52:26] of the churches
[1:52:28] is that uh
[1:52:32] every church which was picked by the
[1:52:35] spirit
[1:52:36] was having certain characteristics was
[1:52:38] having some certain words
[1:52:41] that would be identified in the future
[1:52:44] ages to come for example
[1:52:48] the brother picked for us now they care
[1:52:50] all out this year
[1:52:52] and we have been able to find that like
[1:52:54] this as a city
[1:52:56] the people of that time there in
[1:52:57] laodicea lived
[1:52:59] like this the city was like this the
[1:53:01] physical futures
[1:53:03] you understand as you would read and
[1:53:05] find out in this
[1:53:06] book there were certain characteristics
[1:53:08] that were only in that place
[1:53:11] but also we are significant to the
[1:53:14] spiritual condition
[1:53:16] of the people in future age in another
[1:53:18] future age
[1:53:19] that's why the spirit of god picked that
[1:53:21] touch you understand
[1:53:22] he would go on picking churches
[1:53:24] depending on their characteristics
[1:53:26] of those places so you only pick seven
[1:53:29] because verse seven
[1:53:30] would be the only significant to the
[1:53:33] spirit of the spiritual realm
[1:53:35] about how the condition of the church of
[1:53:37] christ would be
[1:53:39] you know we need to understand this
[1:53:40] because one day i had a man he's here in
[1:53:42] uganda one of the big preachers here
[1:53:44] the first of preachers do you know what
[1:53:46] he's saying
[1:53:49] let me tell you he said
[1:53:53] the seven churches represent
[1:53:57] the seventh mazinga the seven continents
[1:54:03] and imagine them one africa
[1:54:07] another one asia another one
[1:54:10] europe another one north america another
[1:54:13] one
[1:54:14] south america south america another one
[1:54:18] australia another one antarctica
[1:54:22] are we done are we done
[1:54:26] seven continents and he said so those
[1:54:29] are the
[1:54:30] seven continents those are the seven
[1:54:34] churches
[1:54:36] and then and then and then he said also
[1:54:39] by the way without understanding and
[1:54:40] this man has many people following
[1:54:43] he has almost like 10 000 people in the
[1:54:45] church
[1:54:48] yes and when he was speaking these
[1:54:50] things people were shouting
[1:54:53] and i was like oh without understanding
[1:54:55] that's why we're the prophet
[1:54:57] that's why we need to act a prophet
[1:54:59] hallelujah
[1:55:01] then another thing he said now the
[1:55:02] angels let me tell you what the angels
[1:55:04] are
[1:55:05] can i tell you amen pastor tell us
[1:55:09] then they said the angels these are
[1:55:11] going to be
[1:55:12] seven men that god is going to send out
[1:55:15] of each continent
[1:55:18] he will send them to each of these
[1:55:20] continents one from africa
[1:55:22] one from asia one from andy they will be
[1:55:25] having powerful ministries you know when
[1:55:28] someone does not have a
[1:55:29] does not know that did not read it
[1:55:31] properly and is trying to answer an exam
[1:55:34] how they are they are fidgeting
[1:55:35] everywhere they don't know what is right
[1:55:37] and what is not right
[1:55:38] so you can say that is almost close to
[1:55:40] the pointer but also very far from the
[1:55:42] point
[1:55:45] another thing i wanted to know before
[1:55:46] you go into the church ages
[1:55:48] this book you see it it is the only book
[1:55:52] that brother banham allowed to be edited
[1:55:54] of all these messages
[1:55:56] all the messages you will ever read
[1:55:58] about the badapanam there is no
[1:56:00] message with the correct grammar
[1:56:04] are you hearing me amen even the seals
[1:56:07] there is no message with correct drama
[1:56:10] because it was a very
[1:56:12] very poorly educated person
[1:56:16] who is in 27 here grade 7
[1:56:25] oh brother was about your education
[1:56:28] level
[1:56:31] but in english he was right
[1:56:35] no his english was very poor
[1:56:43] the truth of the matter is sister
[1:56:45] richard here has a better english than
[1:56:47] that of brother banner
[1:56:50] yes you are in english you are very very
[1:56:53] well
[1:56:53] very very well doing very well so the
[1:56:56] things of god
[1:56:57] are not revealed by education
[1:57:00] are you hearing me never think that you
[1:57:03] are going to go to a bible college to
[1:57:05] learn
[1:57:05] god that's why we don't go to bible
[1:57:08] college
[1:57:10] yeah yes that's why we want to go to the
[1:57:12] bible apostle paul to say the things
[1:57:13] that i teach you
[1:57:15] they are not from management they are
[1:57:16] not from managed wisdom what man teaches
[1:57:19] but it is from the spirit comparing
[1:57:21] spiritual
[1:57:22] with the spiritual hallelujah so we find
[1:57:25] out that the things that we are
[1:57:26] preaching in this message
[1:57:28] are not from school i'm not from many
[1:57:32] wisdom they're not philosophy
[1:57:34] these are facts i'm giving you about
[1:57:36] this so you can now know when you get
[1:57:37] into
[1:57:38] it another factor you should know
[1:57:41] is that he preached these summons
[1:57:45] all these summons every summon on the
[1:57:47] revelation of jesus christ on the patent
[1:57:49] vision efficient church age dismantling
[1:57:51] pegamos until the last and then
[1:57:54] these are also on tape they are
[1:57:56] available okay the ordering is preaching
[1:57:58] but he tasked one brother and his name i
[1:58:02] told you his name last time his name was
[1:58:04] leaving
[1:58:05] and he told him to edit because for him
[1:58:08] he was
[1:58:08] a theology and he was educated so he
[1:58:11] told him to edit
[1:58:14] and correct all the grammar and even
[1:58:17] some things he added which was not on
[1:58:18] the tips
[1:58:19] but abandoned added those things he
[1:58:21] would record him a voice and then the
[1:58:23] other one would do
[1:58:24] type it in there like on the serpent
[1:58:26] seed and other things
[1:58:27] which are also part of the teaching here
[1:58:29] but were not originally in the original
[1:58:31] trips
[1:58:31] so in other words this book now contains
[1:58:34] most of the teachings of the message
[1:58:36] because it was a compilation of all of
[1:58:39] those
[1:58:40] and it was edited to be grammatically
[1:58:44] good so that god is very wise
[1:58:48] he he knows how to get to even the
[1:58:50] highly educated
[1:58:52] yes when president said when he came to
[1:58:55] ethiopia
[1:58:57] when i was in ethiopia i was by god's
[1:59:00] grace
[1:59:01] connected i got connected to uh
[1:59:04] one brother who currently is the head of
[1:59:07] the peace
[1:59:08] and security council of the african
[1:59:10] union
[1:59:11] and they had a meeting at the african
[1:59:12] union so i asked him i said do you meet
[1:59:14] and can you will you be able to meet
[1:59:16] because they had
[1:59:17] the african head of state uh meeting so
[1:59:19] i said will you meet the president he
[1:59:21] said oh yeah sure
[1:59:22] i always meet himself and he's even
[1:59:23] sitting near me i said oh that's
[1:59:25] very good so i would like to give you
[1:59:27] this church edit book take it to him
[1:59:29] this brother is from togo and he is a
[1:59:31] believer of this message
[1:59:32] you know the believers of this message
[1:59:34] all over hallelujah
[1:59:36] so i gave him that book and i wrote for
[1:59:39] i i wrote
[1:59:40] within it i said dear sir
[1:59:43] i said something like that i said i'm
[1:59:44] here in ethiopia but i'm ugandan
[1:59:46] and i would like to give you this book
[1:59:48] please take time and read it
[1:59:50] and i i signed my name so i sent it to
[1:59:53] the presidential service
[1:59:54] now at the bottom again i said did you
[1:59:57] give it to him he said oh yeah
[1:59:58] you know we were very busy in the last
[2:00:00] session so and we are
[2:00:01] coming out i saw him standing somewhere
[2:00:03] so i was running to
[2:00:04] uh give it to him but he was also
[2:00:06] engaged with another head of state of
[2:00:08] course if he's
[2:00:09] engaged with another head of state it
[2:00:10] remains now this one now is a bit lower
[2:00:13] so he has to uh to wait and he was also
[2:00:16] running out of time so
[2:00:17] he said that then i gave it to one of
[2:00:19] his uh uh
[2:00:20] you know how they call it whatever
[2:00:24] so to and then he would he told me he
[2:00:26] would give it to him
[2:00:27] so i'm sure they did and even if he
[2:00:29] didn't give it to him whoever
[2:00:31] whatever he landed there were those
[2:00:33] alights and i'm sure
[2:00:35] when they did it it makes a lot of sense
[2:00:37] hallelujah
[2:00:39] you know here in a year here in our
[2:00:41] fellowship okay we might not be in our
[2:00:43] fellowship directly but
[2:00:44] one of the sisters here also works in
[2:00:46] the government
[2:00:47] and she did not know of this message out
[2:00:50] of about the banner
[2:00:52] and and uh she's a high ranking
[2:00:55] military officer but when she heard of
[2:00:58] it and she picked this book
[2:00:59] she told me she read this book finish it
[2:01:01] from cover to cover
[2:01:03] and when she left she said where has
[2:01:04] this thing been
[2:01:06] where has it been how come i never knew
[2:01:08] about it
[2:01:10] and she was attending graceland vega and
[2:01:11] the gracely vega is a preacher here in
[2:01:13] kampala
[2:01:14] but he is preaching his own thing but uh
[2:01:16] he takes some of those things from the
[2:01:18] message and preaches it to the people as
[2:01:19] his own messages
[2:01:21] but one day he happened to mention
[2:01:23] william branham by accident
[2:01:25] and the sister went and searched william
[2:01:28] and then she found people talking about
[2:01:29] it so
[2:01:30] she told them please send me this book
[2:01:33] so they sent it over this one and she
[2:01:35] read it and from that time
[2:01:38] she said she believed this message high
[2:01:40] ranking officer but when she came to me
[2:01:42] she said please
[2:01:43] take me and baptize me even i remember
[2:01:45] that place i took at lake guamala
[2:01:47] it was very very adapted even there were
[2:01:50] pigs on the
[2:01:52] and they are they you know made the
[2:01:54] whole place a mess
[2:01:56] and it had rained so but here is a this
[2:01:59] old woman
[2:02:00] she's saying she's a you know she left
[2:02:03] all her you know how they call it
[2:02:07] all asters behind those stones or
[2:02:09] whatever
[2:02:12] all her rants to be able to go in that
[2:02:15] market that
[2:02:15] thing to be baptized and i have a place
[2:02:18] today in the name of the lord jesus
[2:02:19] christ
[2:02:20] hallelujah i'm still holding on to this
[2:02:22] message
[2:02:23] so god will call his own and this book
[2:02:26] is very important because if you study
[2:02:27] it then you will know many of the
[2:02:29] teachings of this message
[2:02:31] and that's another thing you need to
[2:02:32] know all right
[2:02:34] so that's why when you read it some
[2:02:36] words may be difficult for you
[2:02:37] especially in these latest chapters
[2:02:39] but if it is difficult for you to
[2:02:40] understand then as you are reading call
[2:02:43] your brother or your sister whoever you
[2:02:44] are with
[2:02:45] and then try to to chew it down
[2:02:48] if you can't chew it down then you wait
[2:02:51] until we have a meeting like this then
[2:02:53] we can
[2:02:53] be able to tweet down for you praise the
[2:02:55] lord
[2:02:57] yeah so now uh what else do you need to
[2:02:59] know before we get into this
[2:03:03] i i am in the introduction by the way i
[2:03:05] am in the introduction
[2:03:07] aha one more thing i think we are even
[2:03:10] going to close with this by now if there
[2:03:11] is no
[2:03:12] other thing because i see
[2:03:15] we are almost gone for two hours and
[2:03:17] something
[2:03:18] okay now uh another thing that you have
[2:03:22] to know
[2:03:23] about this book is a
[2:03:26] how did we come up
[2:03:30] with the names the specific names of the
[2:03:33] messengers of each church age
[2:03:37] and also how are we able to know the
[2:03:41] period the time
[2:03:43] that this one starts from here to this
[2:03:46] that
[2:03:46] ephesians begins from 53 to 170
[2:03:49] and the messenger is poor samana 1701
[2:03:53] and the message is iranians
[2:03:54] how are we able to know
[2:03:58] how many can answer this question
[2:04:04] and i'm sure you have read it is in the
[2:04:05] introduction right here in the
[2:04:06] introduction so most of you
[2:04:08] are discussing to me now you are going
[2:04:09] deep deep and yet the introduction you
[2:04:11] have not discussed it at all
[2:04:14] i expected you to discuss this about the
[2:04:15] political can you please put brother
[2:04:17] pollock up on video
[2:04:19] do i have to put him on video each time
[2:04:51] which i actually intended to ask you
[2:04:53] people so maybe someone could remind me
[2:04:55] what i had forgotten
[2:04:56] and now that you have reminded me i want
[2:04:58] to thank you god bless you
[2:05:00] there is a point he has brought which i
[2:05:01] had forgotten to mention and i would
[2:05:03] like to mention it another thing you
[2:05:06] need to know about this book
[2:05:07] that brother banham to come up with this
[2:05:09] teaching on the church ages because this
[2:05:11] is merely history
[2:05:13] most of it is history that's why those
[2:05:16] of you
[2:05:17] who had an instrument in school you
[2:05:19] really be bored while you are reading it
[2:05:22] how many hated easter
[2:05:31] you might be bored you might really
[2:05:34] because this is the history of the
[2:05:37] church
[2:05:38] okay this is the i can also
[2:05:41] another book i can give this one is a
[2:05:43] comprehensive history of
[2:05:45] the church but it is not only history
[2:05:49] it also includes the revelation of god
[2:05:52] for each age
[2:05:54] so don't only think you are reading a
[2:05:55] history book
[2:05:57] it is much better than history god bless
[2:05:59] you
[2:06:01] now now please let me not forget the
[2:06:05] point erased
[2:06:07] by the ban i'm read many books of
[2:06:09] unbiased
[2:06:11] why unbiased
[2:06:21] first of all can you people tell me the
[2:06:23] difference between biased and unbiased
[2:06:28] history
[2:06:35] but i told you to compare the two you
[2:06:37] are only giving me one side so
[2:06:38] compare and compare for me unbiased and
[2:06:41] vast history
[2:06:43] for the people history another narrative
[2:06:45] that they are promoting
[2:06:47] history but they are pushing something
[2:06:49] else yes
[2:06:51] gives you the facts for you to decide
[2:06:54] exactly hallelujah so are you following
[2:06:59] you are enjoying this so they
[2:07:10] they
[2:08:27] thank you for patiently waiting
[2:08:34] okay
[2:08:38] it seems i cannot see that microphone by
[2:08:40] the shame
[2:08:44] for some reason
[2:08:56] hello can you hear can you hear me
[2:09:01] can you hear me sister john
[2:09:06] now we had a problem with our network
[2:09:09] and uh
[2:09:09] so uh we went off but
[2:09:13] we just give it about 15 minutes and we
[2:09:14] conclude so
[2:09:16] what was my point before we went off
[2:09:21] no i had left that point so what was i
[2:09:22] talking about
[2:09:34] [Music]
[2:09:43] okay so here was the point i was getting
[2:09:45] to i was trying to tell you that
[2:09:48] uh he quoted many of them he refreshed
[2:09:51] me
[2:09:51] he said things that many others had
[2:09:53] already said
[2:09:56] and in this book you'll find things
[2:09:59] that probably some historians have said
[2:10:01] or things that are fractured in history
[2:10:04] and some of those people who have left
[2:10:07] who have no i will not even use the one
[2:10:09] left but i would use the one
[2:10:10] who have eventually after some time of
[2:10:12] thinking they understood the message
[2:10:14] their intellectual faith failed them and
[2:10:17] they said you have left their message in
[2:10:18] courts i said left because no one can
[2:10:20] leave the message when they're in the
[2:10:21] message can you is it possible
[2:10:24] so suddenly they have not been in the
[2:10:27] vessel before
[2:10:28] okay but they were only around the
[2:10:30] message
[2:10:32] okay so yes brother
[2:10:35] and we are concluding uh
[2:10:39] okay okay uh
[2:10:42] well we are concluding by the channel
[2:10:44] and um the recording of the someone will
[2:10:46] be on youtube
[2:10:48] so i'm sure you can be able to have it
[2:10:50] shared
[2:10:51] uh it will be on the youtube channel
[2:10:53] it's actually even now streaming on the
[2:10:54] youtube channel
[2:10:55] so you can be able to share it whoever
[2:10:56] you want to share it with if that will
[2:10:58] help you
[2:10:59] so now uh what was i saying
[2:11:06] yes they claimed how many are not
[2:11:10] plagiarism
[2:11:14] how many know what library means rogers
[2:11:17] okay brother you know who else knows
[2:11:20] you you know who else okay can you
[2:11:23] explain to us
[2:11:24] what according to your understanding
[2:11:27] your understanding
[2:11:28] what plagiarism is go ahead
[2:11:35] we can't hear you yet you have to admit
[2:11:40] he is going to bless you amen
[2:11:44] yes plagiarism is copying somebody's
[2:11:46] work
[2:11:48] and you can hope if somebody had a
[2:11:51] document you copied
[2:11:52] you'll make your own copy from another
[2:11:53] another somebody's document
[2:11:56] okay all right thank you so now
[2:11:59] uh the have you heard what it means
[2:12:02] copying what someone else has done and
[2:12:06] calling it your own
[2:12:08] now this is the allegation that
[2:12:13] these people get to brother and they
[2:12:15] said brother barnum
[2:12:17] plagiarized the other people's work and
[2:12:20] courtesy
[2:12:20] called it his own are you understanding
[2:12:23] yes
[2:12:23] but now that we are in a youth bible
[2:12:26] study
[2:12:28] you will hear this thing at one point in
[2:12:30] your crucial journey
[2:12:32] and you must hear it from a good
[2:12:34] authority
[2:12:35] and i will tell you this personally i
[2:12:38] believe by the parlam to be a message of
[2:12:40] this generation
[2:12:42] because god has confirmed it to me in
[2:12:43] many ways right
[2:12:45] all right don't look at me as if you
[2:12:48] don't believe me
[2:12:50] i'm sure you believe it too but
[2:12:54] what these people are saying is
[2:12:55] unfounded
[2:12:57] it is not true
[2:13:00] because brother himself has
[2:13:04] stated very well until
[2:13:07] that the things he was speaking the
[2:13:10] history the historic part of it that he
[2:13:11] was saying
[2:13:13] was taken from other people's work
[2:13:17] meaning writings it was facts
[2:13:21] it was things which it started it was
[2:13:24] things which he heard others say
[2:13:26] and it was true from the unbiased
[2:13:30] historians and bible teachers and
[2:13:34] whatever you're going to call it
[2:13:35] but those historians also there were
[2:13:38] parts when it comes to the regulation
[2:13:39] part
[2:13:40] where they will go wrong as a
[2:13:44] prophet of malachi 4 what was his what
[2:13:48] as a prophet of malachi for his what was
[2:13:51] to fold
[2:13:52] please please hear me now this is very
[2:13:53] very important because we will conclude
[2:13:55] with this
[2:13:57] his what was twofold the first purpose
[2:13:59] of the first
[2:14:00] part of his work was as the prophet
[2:14:03] managed to do what someone told me
[2:14:05] please
[2:14:09] you and you are saying the same thing to
[2:14:11] try to answer them children to their
[2:14:13] fathers is the same as doing the work of
[2:14:15] destruction
[2:14:17] and another one would say
[2:14:21] so as a prophet malachi 4 he would also
[2:14:23] be the messenger the seventh angel
[2:14:25] messenger
[2:14:26] of revelation 10 and
[2:14:29] seven which says in the days of that
[2:14:32] voice of the seventh angel when he
[2:14:33] begins to sound
[2:14:34] the mystery of god will be finished as
[2:14:36] he has declared to his servants
[2:14:38] the prophet so he is if his ministry
[2:14:41] finishes the mystery of god
[2:14:42] so as the revelation of the mysteries
[2:14:46] like the suffering see the seven seas
[2:14:48] and other things
[2:14:49] and also it restores
[2:14:53] the truth back again to the church the
[2:14:55] truth which was already there
[2:14:57] told ready by the others but is bringing
[2:14:59] it back
[2:15:01] now throughout church the church ages
[2:15:03] this truth of god has been mad it has
[2:15:06] been
[2:15:06] mixed up here and there and you know all
[2:15:09] through the ages other
[2:15:10] messengers all these other messages we
[2:15:12] are saying something true
[2:15:14] but not entirely true in everything they
[2:15:16] say but it's not like i'll show you one
[2:15:18] of them
[2:15:19] martin luther
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:28] yes he was at this time there was no
[2:15:32] other faith
[2:15:34] and luther was a priest in the catholic
[2:15:36] church
[2:15:37] but he protested against the catholic
[2:15:40] church for their
[2:15:41] false teachings yes which are the first
[2:15:44] doctrines
[2:15:46] and he protested against them because
[2:15:48] they told them
[2:15:50] that all the things that they they teach
[2:15:54] but he did not entirely have the
[2:15:56] revelation of all of them
[2:15:58] but what he had he had a document of 95
[2:16:02] reasons
[2:16:04] why he is protesting against the
[2:16:06] catholic church
[2:16:07] when we come to that age which is the
[2:16:10] status
[2:16:10] i will read for you that faces of
[2:16:12] maternal ruler
[2:16:14] now you'll notice that
[2:16:18] material his idea or his revelation
[2:16:22] that the holy spirit gave him was one
[2:16:26] that they just shall live by faith alone
[2:16:29] in
[2:16:30] christ and not of what
[2:16:34] but it is their gift
[2:16:37] of god so he protested against the
[2:16:41] church which was saying
[2:16:42] whatever you do if you go against the
[2:16:44] church you go against god
[2:16:46] that's why they used to burn people
[2:16:48] because they thought they
[2:16:49] they went against the child so they went
[2:16:51] out against god
[2:16:53] so much protested against them but this
[2:16:57] same guy
[2:16:58] by press babies this man
[2:17:02] smoked he would preach and then go
[2:17:06] around and smoke
[2:17:09] don't look at me like that now i could
[2:17:12] not use a man like that
[2:17:13] yes god could because at that at that
[2:17:16] time that was
[2:17:17] the man with the highest revelation of
[2:17:18] the age
[2:17:20] they just relieved by faith god was only
[2:17:22] destroyed just a little bit
[2:17:24] just a little bit you know those songs
[2:17:26] also came during that time
[2:17:28] this video i don't mind i'm gonna let it
[2:17:31] shine
[2:17:32] this video light of mine i'm gonna let
[2:17:35] it shine
[2:17:36] this is the light of mine i'm gonna let
[2:17:39] it shine let it shine
[2:17:47] and that was shining at that time
[2:17:50] nevertheless
[2:17:52] he had the light but still in a very dim
[2:17:56] way and lightweight on increasing as
[2:17:58] time went by
[2:18:00] so the last messenger's work
[2:18:03] would be to run through all the work
[2:18:06] that has been abused
[2:18:08] and to come and give a final value
[2:18:13] you know the house has been built he
[2:18:16] will come in and say
[2:18:17] no this part is not good this was not
[2:18:19] good because remember
[2:18:21] the last day messenger is the one
[2:18:24] going to oversee the the completion of
[2:18:27] the building
[2:18:29] in this case the church he discussed the
[2:18:31] bride so that
[2:18:32] the owner christ can come and take her
[2:18:34] away
[2:18:35] so he was not going to come at the dude
[2:18:37] from scratch he was going to come and
[2:18:39] they
[2:18:40] fill in the pants which were left you
[2:18:43] understand
[2:18:44] that's why you take from what others
[2:18:46] have done then you would not
[2:18:47] know but this one was right but he went
[2:18:49] wrong but then
[2:18:51] yeah this one is right so that's why you
[2:18:52] would say i am current finished as long
[2:18:54] as calvinism is right
[2:18:56] you know what conversion is hallelujah
[2:19:02] can one person tell us what calvinism is
[2:19:06] please
[2:19:11] either come on now surprise us
[2:19:16] you can surprise us oh
[2:19:19] you would do good to surprise us yes yes
[2:19:22] brother marvin
[2:19:24] no don't you don't give a disclaimer
[2:19:25] just tell us what you do
[2:19:27] no problem feel free
[2:19:46] matter
[2:19:51] [Music]
[2:20:01] calvinism because it was a teaching by a
[2:20:03] preacher called john
[2:20:05] calvin and john calvin was a preacher
[2:20:09] at that time who came after martin
[2:20:12] luther
[2:20:13] and he preached in grace he preached
[2:20:17] grace
[2:20:18] he preached grace grace
[2:20:21] grace and when you're about to finish
[2:20:24] grace
[2:20:25] grace amen and grace you understand
[2:20:28] no matter what you do grace is there not
[2:20:30] a lot to do
[2:20:31] yes you know you're saved you understand
[2:20:34] so if
[2:20:34] they form the respitarian church you
[2:20:36] know what there is
[2:20:38] they believe they are saved as long as
[2:20:40] they believe jesus no matter what they
[2:20:42] do
[2:20:42] you can drink you can do it for the
[2:20:44] great young man you can do whatever you
[2:20:46] know
[2:20:46] your grace is covering right you
[2:20:48] understand so
[2:20:50] once you are saved yourself for good
[2:20:53] it sounds nice sir we have a preacher
[2:20:57] here
[2:20:57] who is preaching a form of communism in
[2:20:59] uganda some of you may know him i will
[2:21:00] not
[2:21:00] mention but the fact is
[2:21:04] that teaching has truth in it
[2:21:07] but not entirely because they go higher
[2:21:10] okay
[2:21:11] they they they believe the truth until
[2:21:13] they over believe it
[2:21:15] you understand and with everything every
[2:21:18] bible teaching
[2:21:19] there is a middle on their own shouldn't
[2:21:22] you go to the left
[2:21:24] or to the right and then there's another
[2:21:27] teaching the armenian teaching
[2:21:28] who says oh no it is by your words you
[2:21:31] are saved without your worship i won't
[2:21:32] be saved so in other words it's all
[2:21:34] about do
[2:21:34] do don't do don't do don't do don't
[2:21:38] and if you do you're going to have it
[2:21:40] but that's not also right because
[2:21:41] we are not said by our what
[2:21:44] it is by grace the gift of god so you
[2:21:47] can say it's all true but as if it's all
[2:21:49] not true so in other words where's the
[2:21:50] truth it's right in the middle of the
[2:21:52] road
[2:21:53] and the messenger of the nation by the
[2:21:55] banner was able to straighten that out
[2:21:57] for us
[2:21:58] and show us where we cannot reach and
[2:22:01] where we cannot go so in other words
[2:22:03] he was sent to us to balance the board
[2:22:06] yes
[2:22:06] so do not expect that whatever is here
[2:22:09] you will never find anywhere else
[2:22:10] but there are many things in here that
[2:22:12] you can never find anywhere else and
[2:22:14] those small things that are in here
[2:22:16] when you're reading this book especially
[2:22:18] if you already been a bible
[2:22:20] student or you're upgrading other books
[2:22:22] or other people
[2:22:23] when you read the challenge you are not
[2:22:25] really looking for those things
[2:22:27] for the many things you have already
[2:22:28] been knowing but you're looking for the
[2:22:30] little things that you never knew
[2:22:31] because those are the things that matter
[2:22:33] hallelujah so when you're reading this
[2:22:35] book read it prayerfully
[2:22:37] not just reading her they told us what
[2:22:38] you should finish

[2:22:53] words are many and
[2:22:54] even men can speak it okay but you need
[2:22:57] to repeat that revelation
[2:22:59] which is found in this message praise

[2:23:05] of you may say will you even
[2:23:08] say i'm just concluding here

[2:25:07] yeah all right okay in order for you to
[2:25:11] fully understand the message of the chat
[2:25:14] hey jess
[2:25:15] i would like to explain the various
[2:25:17] principles that allow
[2:25:18] me to arrive at the names of the
[2:25:20] messages
[2:25:22] the length of the edges and other
[2:25:24] factors of all of them
[2:25:28] since this study was to be the most
[2:25:30] serious one
[2:25:31] i had ever undertaken up to this time
[2:25:35] i sought god for many days for the
[2:25:37] inspiration of the holy spirit
[2:25:40] you heard that part yes
[2:25:43] then only did i read the scriptures on
[2:25:46] the chart edges
[2:25:47] and delve into the many church histories
[2:25:51] written by the most unbiased historians
[2:25:54] that i could find god did not fail to
[2:25:58] answer my prayer
[2:26:00] for while i read the word and the
[2:26:02] historians
[2:26:03] and the histories i was enabled by the
[2:26:06] holy spirit to see
[2:26:08] and fold it to see unfolded
[2:26:12] a pattern that you see unfolded
[2:26:15] yes that runs
[2:26:18] through the centuries and right into
[2:26:21] this
[2:26:22] present last day so this pattern which
[2:26:26] that after this age and this one after
[2:26:28] this and then this one that pattern was
[2:26:30] not
[2:26:30] written anyway among these historians it
[2:26:33] was rather by the bottom
[2:26:35] by the help of the holy spirit was able
[2:26:36] to see this pattern
[2:26:38] and and then run run through this from
[2:26:41] the beginning to the end of the ages
[2:26:43] yes the key given me of the lord whereby
[2:26:48] i was able to determine the messenger
[2:26:50] for each age
[2:26:51] is a most scripture one
[2:26:54] in fact it might be you want to miss
[2:26:56] this past sister
[2:26:57] why don't you come back
[2:27:02] okay he's talking about the key yes
[2:27:05] in fact it might be called the question
[2:27:07] of the bible
[2:27:11] if you are done it might be called
[2:27:15] what is it
[2:27:18] read it back it is the revelation that
[2:27:22] god never changes
[2:27:24] and that his ways are as unchangeable
[2:27:28] as he is yes
[2:27:31] in hebrews 13 8 it says
[2:27:34] jesus christ the same yesterday and
[2:27:37] today
[2:27:38] and forever hallelujah
[2:27:41] that's the key stone he used to
[2:27:43] determine all the
[2:27:44] the messengers that jesus christ never
[2:27:49] god never changes that is the cave stone
[2:27:53] what he did in the other age is doing in
[2:27:54] this one he's doing in the other one
[2:27:56] there was a continuity there was a what
[2:28:00] a continuity hallelujah
[2:28:04] brother can you can you skip a bit and
[2:28:06] go to another i'll start
[2:28:08] with the stanza i love singing another
[2:28:22] after the scriptures
[2:28:38] before that one can you read that
[2:28:42] if someone has got it
[2:28:46] [Music]
[2:28:49] please quickly someone
[2:28:58] [Music]
[2:29:20] the first you will have to keep on doing
[2:29:23] until it is done for the last time
[2:29:26] there will never be attained apply that
[2:29:30] to that
[2:29:30] agent there it is hallelujah
[2:29:33] what you did at first you would have to
[2:29:35] keep on doing until
[2:29:37] it's done for the last time there will
[2:29:39] never be a change hallelujah
[2:29:42] oh my god talk about it apply that to
[2:29:45] the agents
[2:29:46] the the kind of man that god chose
[2:29:49] uh-huh
[2:29:50] the kind of one that watches for the
[2:29:52] first stage and how
[2:29:53] god manifested in that man's ministry
[2:29:56] would be the example for
[2:29:57] all other ages the kind of money choice
[2:30:00] and
[2:30:02] how god manifested himself in that
[2:30:04] manner's ministry
[2:30:05] yes that would be the example for all
[2:30:07] the other agents
[2:30:08] how did they choose him what kind of man
[2:30:11] was he that would be the same key that
[2:30:13] he would use for all the ones
[2:30:15] can you go down and read thus
[2:30:19] what the church was at pentecost is
[2:30:22] the standard down there
[2:30:27] that's what the church was at pentecost
[2:30:30] is the standard
[2:30:32] that is the pattern there is no other
[2:30:34] pattern
[2:30:35] no matter what the scholars say god does
[2:30:38] not change
[2:30:39] that pattern what god did at the
[2:30:41] beginning was
[2:30:42] the one body that pentecost he has to
[2:30:45] keep on doing until they charge 80
[2:30:47] schools
[2:30:48] those scholars may tell you the
[2:30:51] apostolic age
[2:30:52] is over don't you believe
[2:30:55] it such a statement is wrong on two
[2:30:58] accounts
[2:30:59] first of all it is wrong to suppose
[2:31:02] there
[2:31:02] aren't any more apostles just because
[2:31:05] the
[2:31:06] original two trailers are dead and of
[2:31:09] course an apostle means
[2:31:10] a sent one and there are many same ones
[2:31:14] today
[2:31:15] but they are called missionaries
[2:31:18] as long as men are being called and set
[2:31:21] forth
[2:31:21] with the word of life there is an
[2:31:24] apostolic
[2:31:25] going on hallelujah the promise of power
[2:31:33] okay come on proceed there secondly with
[2:31:36] the second point
[2:31:36] secondly they refer to an age of
[2:31:39] manifested holy ghost power
[2:31:42] as being over since the bible has been
[2:31:45] completed
[2:31:46] that is untrue there is not even one
[2:31:49] scripture that suggests that
[2:31:51] but many conclusively state otherwise
[2:31:55] here is our proof that both of these
[2:31:57] charges
[2:31:58] are false and we have already read that
[2:32:00] proof in our previous session now can
[2:32:01] you go to the
[2:32:02] promise of the power down after the
[2:32:04] scripture
[2:32:07] the promise of of power with which the
[2:32:10] apostles were included at pentecost is
[2:32:12] true is to you jews
[2:32:16] and to you your children jews and to all
[2:32:19] that
[2:32:20] are offered for off
[2:32:26] and to as many as the lord our god shall
[2:32:29] cause
[2:32:30] both jews not to do and death
[2:32:33] until he stops falling they pay the cost
[2:32:36] of message
[2:32:53] so we find out that this key shows us
[2:32:57] that
[2:32:57] uh this truth will not change that
[2:33:00] in believing in the up oh my god
[2:33:04] i think i'm going to keep this to
[2:33:06] another service to another
[2:33:07] time because i i see that i'm going to
[2:33:12] have a problem of covering this the way
[2:33:14] i want it because
[2:33:15] of now the time that is first spent you
[2:33:18] need to go back home it is already
[2:33:20] almost six uh but i wanted to show you
[2:33:23] also syria the introduction
[2:33:25] we need to really emphasize so much of
[2:33:26] the introduction because the others
[2:33:28] can you know just skip over over it and
[2:33:30] get the
[2:33:31] major media points but the introduction
[2:33:32] here is not only for the freshman church
[2:33:35] age
[2:33:35] but it's for the whole of the ages and
[2:33:38] so we did it
[2:33:38] even if next friday uh
[2:33:42] or when it was going to be tuesday yeah
[2:33:45] even if we still were on the chat
[2:33:46] ages and at least finish it but mainly
[2:33:49] focus on the introduction
[2:33:50] so can also be able to know now but let
[2:33:53] me read for you this other one of this
[2:33:54] before i conclude
[2:33:56] now out of this first key that we have
[2:33:58] received of the law there comes another
[2:34:01] and slightly less wonderful truth i say
[2:34:03] that the true church would always try to
[2:34:05] be like it was in a group of acts
[2:34:07] that is exactly right but we have
[2:34:10] discovered that the word
[2:34:11] also teaches an invasion of error until
[2:34:13] there is a complete blackout of truth
[2:34:15] in the last day when the lord is about
[2:34:17] to appear so now
[2:34:19] in the age we are living in we are we
[2:34:23] we are aware that here we are
[2:34:26] almost at the time of full black out of
[2:34:28] the truth you know
[2:34:30] but we know that the truth of god in
[2:34:33] every church will
[2:34:34] continue what is it what's the key that
[2:34:37] jesus was the same yesterday
[2:34:38] okay that the true church will always
[2:34:41] believe that
[2:34:42] biology
[2:34:52] those things no longer happen it just
[2:34:53] happened among the disciples
[2:34:55] their true child would always believe in
[2:34:57] a living god
[2:34:59] then preachers will always believe in
[2:35:00] miracles signs and ones they will always
[2:35:02] believe in
[2:35:02] god who never fails god who is always
[2:35:04] the same yesterday
[2:35:06] and forever and i think that will bring
[2:35:08] you to our clause for
[2:35:09] today uh we can continue from that
[2:35:13] next week i'm sure that that was a
[2:35:15] blessing for us tonight
[2:35:17] was it not let us
[2:35:27] come to see
