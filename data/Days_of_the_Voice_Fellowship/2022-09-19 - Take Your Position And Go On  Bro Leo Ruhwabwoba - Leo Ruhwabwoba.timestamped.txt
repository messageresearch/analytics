[2:13:13] you know i learned this in ethiopia
[2:13:17] when the preacher preaches
[2:13:19] people so blessed
[2:13:21] they don't say we shall pray for you
[2:13:24] they don't say we shall pray for you
[2:13:27] they bless him right there and then when
[2:13:29] you never move
[2:13:30] so they stretch their hands
[2:13:33] they say god bless you
[2:13:35] so i want us to tell the pastor of god
[2:13:40] amen amen
