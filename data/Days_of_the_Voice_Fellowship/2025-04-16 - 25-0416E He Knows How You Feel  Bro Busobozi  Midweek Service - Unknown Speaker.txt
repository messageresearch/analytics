Our precious heavenly father, we thank you for this evening. You have given us yet another opportunity in your presence. Your presence is everything to us. Father, I pray Lord that you'll come and make yourself known to us as we open the pages of your holy word. Lord, those that you determine that will be a part of this service tonight, I pray that Lord, we will draw from your presence. Come and fill us, Lord. Answer our questions. Quench our thirst. And may we leave this place tonight when we are revived. We commit this service into your in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a clap of praise. Amen. I'd like to uh greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Just greet your neighbor, tell him or her, God bless you. All right. So um before you get seated we are going to read from the Bible in the book of Hebrews chapter 2. Vers 16. We are going to read from 16 to 18. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his brethren, that he might be merciful and faithful high priest, that he be sorry, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people. For in that he he himself has suffered being tempted, he is able to sar them that are tempted. [Music] That verse is what? 16. The translation here is a little different. Uh, is that Sorry. Can you read that again? I [Music] hear. No, that's wrong translation. Thank God for the message and also for the English Bible that we can be able to read ourselves. Okay. Now let let me just interpret this and then you will try verse 17 there. Amen. For verily he took on him the nature of angels. For verily he took not on him the nature of angels, but he took on him the seed of Abraham. All right. Um, can you read now verse 17? [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. How many are happy to be in the house of the Lord tonight? Amen. Praise the Lord. It's always very good to be in the house of the Lord. Uh before we go into the word this evening, I just want to say this actually this um from last weekend I was supposed to be um [Music] away. I was actually supposed to be in in in Singapore that last weekend. We had arranged uh meetings there with pastor Dave and uh in Singapore. Uh it is it was unfortunate that we could not make the trip because I had to yet secure another another uh visa for another country which has delayed uh to come through. And so this evening I just want to bring you greetings from brother Gary. He he asked me to greet you. We are supposed to be with him and the saints in Brisbane this weekend for their Easter meetings. Um but we are yet still waiting on the response for for the visa to come. has taken longer than usual. So, we've had to reschedu for that and uh I I did not you know you planned but God usually has other plans. So, I was as I was asking the Lord, oh God, why like why did we plan it and you did not let it work out the way we had planned? And uh the answer I received was a call from Kenya pastor and he was asking me to go and be with them this Easter and uh I was like okay so this was your plan and I had other plans. So it turns out that instead of flying overseas we are going to go just um across the border. Um uh we will be with the saints in kaosi and um pastor has asked me also to go with I think there's one of the brothers who is going to be speaking at uh the meetings um um uh at speckled Yeah, I do not know him but I think his name is brother Keith. So we shall be taking those meetings in Kaos [Music] City Saturday early morning I think he'll be preaching here um either tomorrow and then I'll be uh driving with him uh to Kimosi where we shall be for the rest of the weekend. So, um but I I believe that the rest of you who are not going to be traveling with me are planning to be at the meet at the convention here that is a Thursday. I think they have the first service beginning at around 6 and then uh the the rest of the services on on Friday. Please be there. You know, seeing all the the ministers that are gathered, you know, coming from different parts of the world. Always go and see and go and hear. You know, God always has a table spreaded something for for you. This is a weekend. It's a holiday rather. um where you are not going to be at work. So where are you going to be? At home when others are in a in a convention. Believers don't believe that. A prophet taught us always go and join in. When all the saints are coming from different parts of the country bringing their leaks of fire, you go and be together with me. So probably I'll also go there on Friday and partake of uh whatever the Lord has for us. Then Saturday early in the morning, I'll be traveling. So Sunday morning we shall have our usual service here. So please come and and and attend it and then after the service one Sunday morning and then you can now go back and to the convention up to Monday. Also I wanted to appreciate those um several uh uh brethren I think more than 20 brethren who have been able to contribute towards the cause of sister Assumptarity and love. I talked to the sister last night you know she was in tears because of gratitude and um and also you know not knowing that the the devil could do that to her. It was you know when they when they con you when a conman cons you feel so stupid but you see what I advised her was sister and I want to also advise all of you and those of you listening And I think I'll need my microphone. Uh I I cannot hear myself well, brother. So I just need to advise you uh to really um be careful when you are using your phones. Be careful when you are promised a deal. Be careful when you are when you think you are going to hit a jackapot when you are going in a gold mine to take the [Applause] treasure the treasure you never worked for. Some people are so lazy but they always want to go for a treasure hunt. They think someone forgot it there. someone is so kind to give to you and then they will capture your mind and then you take you give them everything you have. You really have to be cautious on those kind of things. She told me the story and I had to tell her sister you have to be on the watch for those kind of things just to know whatever you have not worked for and someone wants to give it to you there is a problem somewhere always don't desire free things I mean you have to end up and pay for it for to be in three nights in So it was not good. But um we want to thank the body of of believers that we are able to run out to her rescue. These are not things we can always do. Now that we have warned you, if the next of you also goes into the same thing, don't expect the church to receive. We will pray for you. So don't get due saying the church will help me. Instead of giving your ch your little money to the corn people, pay it in the convention. give it to land funds, give it in offerings. That is the better investing. So, I think that's all I have to say about that. But I I was so touched to really see what you could do to one of [Music] us. God bless you so much. Amen. So, this evening For just a few moments, I want to speak on a subject of he knows how you feel. Tell your neighbor, he knows how you feel. Now we are thinking of Easter. This being the res the resurrection period. It's a season when the whole world is remembering uh his resurrection. And uh you know we we know that not all that remember his resurrection really believe in it. But you see when I say he is I mean Jesus. So who is Jesus? Who was Jesus? Why did he come to the earth? Why did he suffer and die to begin with? Now, we know that the Bible calls him the word of God. And we know that the Bible in the book of John 1 says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with [Music] God and the word was God." So, so we believe that Jesus is God. So, the question then comes up. This confuses many believers and many Christians. They say, "So, who is God then? How can Jesus being a man be God? Do we have two gods?" The answer is no. We have one God. Praise the name of the Lord. I'm happy to see you, Sister Rachel. We have one God and the the Bible calls this God a spirit. So this is we are going to first of all take take you through that. Just give you a few scriptures. I know this will help many of you. John 4:24 says God is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth. So God is not flesh and blood. God is a spirit. And we are talking about the creator of heaven and earth. He he created the whole heaven, the whole earth and everything that is in him. He's a spirit. But when you see also here in the book of Isaiah 45, he says, "Tell ye and bring them near." Vers 21. Yeah. Let them take counsel together. Who has declared this from ancient [Music] time? Excuse me. My my my sound is really just loud, brother Shame. Today I'm not appreciating my sound as always. I'm sure you can make it better. Thank you. So it says here, who has you can just check check out that verse 21. It says, "Who has declared this from ancient time? Who has told it from that time? Have not I the Lord? And there is no God else beside me, a just God and a Savior. There is none beside me. Look unto me and be ye saved all the ends of the earth. For I am God and there is none else. [Music] [Music] So now we see here he's calling himself the Lord and he's saying he's God and there is no God beside him. The trinity draws three sculpt sculptures. You can actually go on on on Google you will see that and the father is in the middle and and the Holy Spirit. There is even three thrones in heaven according to them. One for the father, one for the son who is beside him on the right side and then another one for the holy spirit. But you see that is all the imagination of man. God is a spirit and there is no one beside him. He is the lord and the bible says he is a savior. There is no savior beside him. In other words, he's the only savior that there is in the world. Praise the name of the Lord. So then if we say Jesus is God, that's a very big claim. And it is important for you a believer to be able to know how does Jesus become God. If you go right here in the book of Matthew and I I'll take you in other scriptures but let's first I did not prepare this but I feel to read it for you this in the book of Matthew chapter one I read some of these kind of scriptures when I'm doing outreach to uh people but I want you to also get to understand these things vers um 21. I'm just trying to read the verse 27 time. And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their [Applause] sins. Amen. So, he's talking about Mary giving birth to a son and this son would be called Jesus. Everybody say Jesus. And he says Jesus what shall he do? He will save his people from their sins. So which means Jesus had his people. Who are his people? His people are not just a few people. His people are his people are not only Uganda. Oh America. Oh Cameroon. Oh Israel, his people are the whole world. In the book of first John, he says rather in John one, he says he came among his own, but his own received him not. He was the light that shined in darkness, and darkness comprehended it not. to as many as received him to them he gave them power to become to be the son of God. So now we see this Jesus had power to save. Where did he get that power? There's only one savior and that is God and God is a spirit. How then can Jesus be a savior? The only way Jesus can be the savior It's because Jesus is God. Are you enjoying this now? Praise the name of the Lord. And and if you look at the book of Malachi chapter 3, there are many ways we can approach this. Look at Malachi chapter 3 vers one. Behold, I will send you my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me, and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant whom ye delight in. Behold, he shall come, saith the Lord of hosts. [Music] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Are you following me now? So, here is Prophet Malachi giving this prophecy. And he says, "I'll send my messenger. This messenger here is John the Baptist. and he shall prepare the way before me. Remember the these prophets of the Old Testament, we are always speaking on behalf of God. And here this uh prophet Malachi is speaking as if it were God himself speaking. And also God is speaking and he's saying I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before me meaning who was coming. Oh you are not following me. Are you following me? So meaning who was coming? God. So the messenger was going to come to prepare the way before God is coming. John the Baptist did not come to prepare for another man. He came to prepare for God, the creator of heaven and earth. And he said, "Now when he comes, he prepared the way before me. And the Lord, the same Lord who said, I am the Lord and beside me there is no other God." Praise the name of the Lord. Here he says, "And the Lord whom he sick," you know the Jews had a temple which had three places, the holy of holies and the holy place and the sanctuary and they would go in there and worship, you know, and you know they were seeking after this God, you know, all the days of their life. The high priest will go in into the holy of holies once a year, every year to atone for his sins and of the people. But now here God is declaring that the Lord whom he seek would now suddenly come into his temple. All right. Now you remember there was a temple of Solomon. The temple of Solomon was a temple made with hands. It was built And you see the when you talk about a temple and you talk you talk to the Jews, they think you're talking about that building. But you see, always pay attention when God speaks through his servants. The word means much more than what you are hearing. That's why many times even after the preacher has preached, go back and listen. you will see you are hearing something else. So here Malachi says that then the Lord will suddenly come to his temple and he calls this Lord who is going to come the messenger of the covenant whom they delighted in. You remember how he made the covenant in the Old Testament with the Jews with with the Israelites. Actually he made the convert with Abraham much earlier and he says that he is going to suddenly come into his temple and the people were reading this every day. They were thinking God is going to come in the holy of holies. That is the proper explanation. The easy explanation that everyone would understand. God is going to come into the temple. God is going to come into the holy of holies. But I want you to see this meant more than [Music] one. If you look at John 2 18, he says, "Then answered the Jews and said unto him, what sign showest thou unto us? See that thou doest these things? Jesus now he's here. He is born. Actually, let let me tell you this scripture in Malachi was already fulfilled. They were looking at him. And I couldn't understand. They said, "Give us a sign. What sign do you show us?" And Jesus answered and said unto them, he gave them a sign. Remember whatever sign that God will give you, it will be a word sign. Amen. He gave them many signs during his earthly ministry and this is one of them. One time when they asked him for a sign, he he talked about prophet Jonas and he said how he spent three nights and days in the womb of the of the fish. They couldn't understand. But he was talking about his death and and and resurrection, how he would be there for three days. And it was a sign which was before them. actually happened but they were still blind. The religious world today they have all sorts of signs but they can't understand it because they have no revelation. May God give you revelation this evening. So we see here he gave them a sign and he said destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up. Then they they began to speak among themselves 46 years. This temple was in building and you you are saying you're going to rare it up in 3 days. They didn't understand. How can you say this temple this temple we build? It was built for 46 years. Who are you? a little boy who was born by who don't even know your father and you are saying in in in three days you're going to build this temple again you're blasphing they didn't understand it but the Bible says he spake of the temple of his body so listen to me when he told them destroy this temple I don't know where he was pointing but I can assure you even if he was pointing to himself they would still have remained blind destroy this temple they would say the man was even beating his church he was he's a proud man he can't understand but this are sac scripture can you imagine he said destroy this number but he was talking about his own body because this this body of Jesus, Amen, was the temple of God himself, the creator of heaven and earth, the one who say that he had even prophesied it. And you know when Malachi prophesied and he said then the Lord shall suddenly come into his temple. He was talking about the body of Jesus. Amen. So now when Jesus came, he knew that his body was a temple. Amen. Jesus himself knew. He was more than a man. He knew his body was a body of God to dwell in him. Amen. And he says, "Destroy this temple." A temple means where God dwell. a place where God dwells and he said, "Destroy it and I will raise it up." Let me ask you a question. Who do you think was speaking those words? Do you know that Jesus was 100% man and 100% God? Sometimes when he spoke, it was not God who was speaking. Sometimes when he spoke it was God who was speaking. So you need to understand when you hear the word who is talking is either God or the son it is either the son or the father because the father and the son united together. Amen. Amen. So at this point it was not the son talking it was the father talking when he said destroy this temple I will raise it up. Amen. What raised up Christ spirit that same spirit raised Christ from the dead if it dwells in us it will quicken our mortal body. God is our spirit. So you see now what was speaking it was not Jesus speaking but it was the mouth of Jesus moving but it was God the creator of heaven and earth speaking through a man and he is the same yesterday today and forever. He he does it every day in our life. You can see a man you know and then you say God is speaking to you. God speaks through man. Tell your neighbor God speaks through man. And here God is speaking and he's saying destroy this temple. I will raise it up. Who can raise the dead? God alone can raise the dead. Amen. And it is God, the father of our Lord Jesus, who raised up Christ from the dead. How many understand? Say amen. He raised him from the dead. Who raised Jesus from the dead? God raised Jesus from the dead. Who is God? God is a spirit. Who is Jesus? Jesus is the son of God. Son of God means flesh of God. So meaning Jesus was not another God. It was the temple where the creator of heaven dwelt inside of him. So sometimes God can speak from him. Sometimes he can speak from him from him from him. Sometimes you can speak from heaven. So people are confused when they hear our voice speaking. They say that they they fail to understand. God can speak from heaven because God feels all of heaven. God can speak from Jesus. God was feeling all of Jesus. God can speak out of me of you because he is the same God. Are you confused? It means the presence God who dwells everywhere at the same time. He fills the mountains. He feels the sea. He's in me. He's in you. He's in America. He's in heaven. He's in Russia. At the same time, hallelujah. But when he was in Jesus, he was there in his full [Music] name. In me, he's in me in a portion, in a measure. That's why I need you. because you also have a measure. So when we all are combined, we make up the fullness of God. Amen. So you see that's why when he says she is him, he means the body and the body is a collective body is a many membered body. You see that's why we we don't look at uh at churches individual churches as the only true church. No, the true church of Jesus Christ is a many membered body and it is all over the world and we need one another. Each of us has a portion portion. He came on the day of Pentecost and he divided himself into leaks of fire and this rested upon the disciples and each of them started speaking in tongues. What was that? That was God resting upon them in the form of the spirit. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. But in Jesus, he was there in his full name. So Jesus was a temple of God, the fullness of Godhead bodily. That's why when Paul was walking and he met that pill of fire, the same pill of fire that came on the day of Pentecost which went out of God. When he met it, I asked a question, who are you, my Lord? Paul knew that that is the Lord of heaven. But the name the name had now been known because he had been born in a in a house in a he said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest but remember listen carefully closely Paul did not persecute this spirit of fire was persecuting people, people who had weaknesses, but people who had the spirit of God in them. Paul was persecuting them. And the pillar of fire was about and the pill of fire said, "I am Jesus." Now listen, listen. Look at this. He's speaking. I am Jesus whom you thou persecuted. Amen. God identified himself one with the body. Is this very very difficult theology? How many are understanding? Amen. God was in his people. In other words, God Paul was God was telling Paul, I am God Jesus. I am God in my people. [Music] And when Jesus was on earth, he was the fullness of Godhead. And when he left, you see the body is So just like Jesus walked on earth, when we walk on earth, we are the same same work. Amen. Same power, same authority. Amen. That's why certain things we even vote and they say the majority. Why? Because we believe the church is a body of Christ. It has the power to decide. It has the power to speak things and things. You see the body and the head has become one. Jesus answered and said unto them, destroy this temple and in three days I is not the body speaking. The spirit in the body speaking. I will raise it up. Did he raise it up? I say yes, he raised it up. Easter morning. He rose again. Who raised him up? God the creator of heaven and earth. He raised up his temple. Hallelujah. Amen. My my my. Now in John chapter 10, There are many many scriptures which are very sweet on this. But the Holy Spirit led me to pick out a few to share with you tonight. Then came the Jews around about him and said to him, how long does thou make us to [Music] doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell us plainly. The Jews knew Christ means God. So if you are the Christ who was promised, if you are the Messiah, just say I am the Messiah. Because you're confusing us. Sometimes you speak as if you are the Messiah. Sometimes you speak as if you are not. So who are you? You're confusing us. Tell us plainly. These are the religious leaders. until today they are confused. But thank God our eyes are open. Hallelujah. We know who Christ is. Amen. And the church is built upon that foundation. The church is built upon, Amen. the revelation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Tell us plainly. And then Jesus answered them. He will always answer them, but they will never understand. And and I told you and you believe not the works that I do. If you are Christ also, we can know by the works. The works that I do in my father's name, they bear witness of me. What was his father's name? It was the Lord. And in other words, oh my God, he's trying to tell them. Can you see the works I am doing? Assuring my power. I am the Lord. Can you see? I have come to you in my father's name. But they still were blind. And he said, "But ye believe not because ye are not of my sheep, as I said unto you, my sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me." Amen. We are of his sheep truly. And I know them, and they follow me. and I give unto them eternal life. Give them eternal life. Only God can. Jesus is answering them but without answering them. In other words, only the sheep can hear his voice. Are you his sheep? He is saying he will give you eternal life because he's the alpha of eternal life. He's the beginning. He's the end. He's the alpha. He's the omega. There is no God beside him. I give them eternal life and they shall never perish. Neither shall any man block them out of my heart. My father Oh, now he has gone back to his father. Some of you now your heads are saying no. Don't you worry. Let's continue together my father because I want you to remember Jesus sometimes speaks as Jesus and sometimes he speaks as the father. So you need to know when who is speaking. My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. Wait wait wait wait wait. This theology is very delicious. Here he says my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give them eternal life. They cannot perish. Neither shall man them out of my house. first person pronoun. No one can pluck them out of my my hand. Who is talking? The father is talking through the son and then afterwards the son begins talking. My father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to flatter them out of my father's hands. In whose hands are you? Are you in the hands of Jesus? Are you in the hands of the father? Praise God. We are in the hands of the father. We are in the hands of the father. Amen. Because Jesus's hand are the father's hand, the father and the son are one. Amen. And he says, hey, right here, vers 30, he says, I and my father are one. Hallelujah. Now the se like ah ring their heads and they confused now. Then the Jews took up the stones again to stone him because they had now understood. It means that this guy actually claiming to be God himself. Why? because they failed to understand Jesus the son was not God. But the father was God and the father is a spirit and that father in the son and that father was speaking to them claiming to be God. And I said you a human being you are claiming to be God. We will kill you right now. They fail to understand the relationship between the father and the son. Don't also fail to understand. I and my father are one. Then the Jews took up the stones against Jesus answered, "Many works have I showed you from my father. For which of those do you stone me? Who is talking? Who is talking? The son is not talking because the father can never be stormed. Why? Because a spirit. But the son can be stoned and the son can be killed. And indeed the son was killed. and the father raised you up again. So he was not telling them why do you stone me because of the good works that I have shown you from my father for the for of which of those works do you stone me? The Jews answered him, saying, "For a good work we stone thee not, but for blasphemy, and because of thou being a man, maketh thyself God." Did Did he say he was God? He simply said he was a son of the father. And he said that he and his father are one. That's why their eyes became red and they said we will stone it right here. Friends, let me tell you today the church world is storing Jesus by rejecting him by rejecting his word. This word and the father are one. I and the father are one. Hey, I can also say that I am a father. I am a father. Oh, glory to God. You don't have to understand it. You just have to believe it with all your heart. You are a part of God and God is a spirit and he is dwelling in you. The body is yours, but the but but but that which is on the inside is the father controlling you, speaking through you, doing the works through you, living the life through you. That's why you cannot live like the world. When you are filled with the spirit of God, you cannot live like the world. Something in you leads and controls your flesh. The flesh is not that, but that controls the when you die will raise you up again. That's why we believe in a resurrection of the dead. Amen. The blood of Jesus was not of Jesus. Was of God. You and I were born out of lust. But you see Jesus was not born out of that. He the seed of Jesus came from God. The egg that from him was a was a human was humanlike egg but created by God. It was not out of Mary. It was not precreated. [Music] God created both seed and egg and they came into the womb of Mary. When she said be unto me it happened and right in there was little Jesus growing growing one month, two months, three months. Who was that? Elohim to mankind. Hallelujah. Acts 20 27. For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take it therefore unto that and unto all the flock of God, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers to feed the church of God. God has purchased with his own blood. Who bought the church? God himself whose blood was shed, the blood of Jesus. But now here God is claiming the blood to be his own. He's saying it was my blood which was shed not just the blood of a human being because this human being was me expressed into human kind of the duty of Jesus Christ. Therefore, when Mary, knowing not a man, she was with a male uh uh God, the Almighty Jehovah, and he overshadowed her. And God is the creator that created a blood cell in the womb of Mary. Mary knowing no man at all. And that brought forth the very creative blood of God to redeem us from our life coming in here to be born of sexual [Music] desire. And then that blood was drawn out of Emmanuel's vein. on Calvar's cross. And today it has the same saving, redeeming, holy power that it did in the day the transfusion was made out at Calvary. You believe it? Say amen if you believe. We are redeemed by the blood of God. The blood says we are bought by the blood. The Bible says we are bought by the blood. And redeemed by blood. God is own blood. How is it? God is blood. You ask. God has no blood. How could it be? Because oh I love it when the prophet says because that is not an imagination. is giving you thus say the word because it was God's creative blood that he created in order that redeemer us and he came and lived in the same body that he created. He created the body. The body grew, grew, grew, grew and was born. Amen. And then God himself, this is my beloved son. This is my beloved creative blood in whom I am well pleased. God himself came down and lived in the body he had created. Amen. Was Jesus a son of God? Yes. But God lived in his son. Are you confused or you are now getting revelation? The Godhead is one of the things that disturbed me when I first believed this message until I said, "God, I'm no longer going to try and figure it out because I would understand when I read the scripture, when I understand another one, I see another one. Ah, it puts me off again now until I said I give up." But I believe there is one God. Say God reveal it to me. So what I'm preaching to you tonight, I'm preaching it out of revelation. I am not confused. You can be sure of that. If you feel confused, it is because you yourself need revelation. Revelation doesn't come from a preacher. Revelation comes from God. God had to suffer now. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. How was it? All right. Now, I want us to see something here. God, came and lived in his own body which he created. God had to suffer temptation. God had to suffer temptation trapped in his own body which he created. God had to suffer temptation. He had to suffer sexual temptation. Our prophet is saying these things. God, we are not talking about Jesus here. We talking about God. Think about it. the creator of heaven and earth and he lived on his body he was feeling different I'm having lust God he had to suffer sexual temptation why we will know why he had to suffer all kinds of temptation to be tempted by the devil in riches in powers, dominions and so forth. He was tempted with money also, dominion, power, vain, glory. He was temped with all that yet he was cut. He had a reason why. In order to do it, God couldn't be as God in the spirit. He had to humble himself. He had to be God in flesh. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why you as a part of God. You are here in the flesh to be touched by sickness to be touched by lust to be touched by that temptation. But when you overcome, you will be on a greater glory than all the angels of heaven. Because no angel has ever overcome. You cannot overcome without fighting. But when you fight and you go through it, then you are an overcomer. You are higher than the angels. You know what it means to be sick. You know what it means to be weak. You know what it means to be sexually. Then you overcome them then overcome. They will sit with me on my throne. Jesus say even I I overcame and I will sit with my father in his throne. That is dominion. Not a physical seat dominion. Amen. All right. All right. Can I continue and I bring this to a close? Now I am speaking this morning on the dity of Christ so that you will know who he is that we are worshiping today. Amen. Not a baby in a manger, not a Santa Claus, but we are worshiping the almighty God. in the duty of his son. And notice then the blood came down and was it was Christ Jesus God himself coming out of spirit went into Jesus Christ. Excuse me. I want you to see this very clearly today. It says and said and the Bible said God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. It says God himself Jehovah lived in Christ and was made a kinsman to us. God became my brother. Amen. You people are not excited about this. God becoming our brother, you should smile about that, brother. God becoming your brother. It means if God is becoming your brother, he's coming down to your level. So you can feel what you feel. So at the end, he will be able to say, "I know how it feels." Amen. Hallelujah. That's why we should always pray when we are confused, when our back is against the wall, when we have headache, when we have problems, because God understands what to feel, more than anyone will ever. Hallelujah. God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. He became a kinsman to us because he was born in human flesh like we are. The blood cells was developed by God. The flesh cells the flesh cells were developed in the womb of Mary. Developed not taken out from Mary that brought forth the child. Mary was the incubator and God came down and lived in human flesh and was tempted. every man are just like we is asking us do you believe that and then he says all right now then when he did that he freely gave us his blood he didn't have to do it he made a sacrifice he couldn't have went right on up into glory he could have gone right up up into glory He could have just been transfigured like he was on Mount Transfiguration, went into heaven and never died for us. But to be willing to die for us, he gave freely his blood at Calvary. He was a man of sorrow, acquainted with grief, and he made a public testimony. Jesus would have decided, God through Jesus would have decided to bypass Calvary. He would not have died and he would have still gone back to him. But he decided I will not bypass. Let me die so I can give them my blood freely. They who were born in sin, they will receive my sinless blood. That's why the blood of Jesus will never lose his power. Amen. That's why in Hebrews 4:14 it says, "Seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens, Jesus the son of God, let us hold fast our profession. For we have not an which cannot be touched by with a feeling of our infirmities, but with all tempted like we are. in all [Music] points yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in the time. Amen. Let me read for you this quote before I finish in in Hebrews chapter 2. Uh uh uh the message Hebrews chapter 2 1957 God could not suffer in spirit. He had to become flesh to feel the pain of the sickness. Are you sick? Do you have pain? tooth ache. Jesus felt it. Are you tempted and he feels squeezed? So he cannot overcome. He knows you cannot. That's why he failed it and he overcame it so that you two can overcome. That's why when you are squeezed your back is against the wall to him and tell him father help me. That's why it is important to be vulnerable. Father help me. I am helpless. sincerely you do it and then he'll come to you to feel the pain of sickness to feel. He came down in flesh to feel the temptation of [Music] lust. Lust. How many here know last? All right. You are very holy. All of you here have failed last. Jesus felt it. The temptation of lust. To feel the temptation of want. You want something but Jesus felt it. To feel the temptation of hunger. Hey. Lord, I wish I get that food to feel the power of death. Maybe you are listening to me today and you're so sick and you think you're going to die. You are feeling the power of death. He felt it too, but he overcame it. You too can overcome it. that he might take upon himself to stand in the presence of the great spirit Jehovah. He felt every one of those things so that he can stand before the spirit Jehovah the spirit not the man to the spirit to make intercession to this life. Amen. Amen. There is one God and one man Jesus the mediator between man and God. He mediates for us. He intercedes for us to this life. The blood speaks for us. And Jesus took that in order to make intercessions for us. He knows how it feels. Tell your neighbor. He knows how it feels. Go away. That's why when sometimes God wants a preacher to preach something, he will take them through something so they can preach what they fear. They have they can have compassion for the people. One time I think it was Hosea he he he desired a prostitute. God told him marry a prostitute. He could not have married her unless he desired her. So that so that God can use his life to preach to the Israelites. And when he was speak Thus say the Lord, you have left me. You have gone after other men. He felt it. It was personal because he felt it. He knew how it go. Hallelujah. That's why God had to come and be born in Christ to go through every temptation that you and I go through. And then he can say, "I know how it feels and I am here to tell you tonight, he knows how it feels." Amen. Amen. Yes. Let me try to bring the quote to a close. And Jesus took that in order to make intercession for us. When you are tempted, he knows how you feel. Did you ever notice when we vote for a president? Every farmer will vote for a president that's been a farmer. For he knows that he had a part of the farmer's life. He wants someone who understands. And before God could ever understand him being that great holiness, how could he ever understand after he condemned [Music] man? By his holiness, he condemned man. But the only way you would ever know how to justify man to become a man. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. And God overshadowed the virgin and she brought forth a body, not Jewish blood, not gentile blood, but his got his own blood. Jesus was not a Jew. He was not a Gentile. He was not an American. He was not a black man. He was not a white man. Hey, he was not a red man. He was gone. Matter of fact, I can tell you his skin pigment was looking closer to yours right now. People of that time look like that. He had the blood of God in him. God is created blood. No sexual desire in his blood and this blood cell in the womb of this woman brought forth the son. Let me correct that. He's saying he did not he's not saying that he did not have sexual desire. He's saying that the way he was born, it was not through sexual desire, it was God's creative blood cell in the womb of this woman that brought forth the son. And when he was baptized by John the Baptist, John said, "I bear record see the spirit of God like a dove coming down and abinding upon him." God came down in this body of flesh. No wonder Jesus could say, "All powers in heaven are given to my heart." Imagine the power Jesus felt. If at all he had used it, hey, we would not have been saved. But the Bible says, "Let this mind be in you." Ephesians 2 as us in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God will not rob to be equal with God. But he took upon himself being found in a fashion as a man. He took upon himself the form of a [Music] servant and he humbled himself even to the death of the cross. What are we talking about? God just humbling himself. God and man became one. Heavens and earth embraced him and he was the one who can give reconciliation for our sin. That is the reason that in his name healing takes place. He knows your pain. And if you're sick, hear the sound of my voice. I said be healed in the name of Jesus. Amen. If you receive it with all your heart and say amen, your pain will disappear. Your tumor will disappear. Your sickness will disappear. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. I believe he was a God man. Believe start this in the message that he says I believe he was a God man. He was more than a man. He was the divine one that God sent from out of heaven. I know he cried out like a man when he was dying at the [Music] cross. Raining rocks and darkening skies. My savior bowed his head and died. That's right. He was a man when he was dying. But when he rose on the third day, he proved that he was God. That's right. God was in his son. He raised him up. He was divine. Musicians can come. He was divine. I believe every word of He was a good man. You are a God man. Amen. Don't you worry about what you feel in the body. Amen. The body is a man. The body is human. There is something in you brother. There is something in you sister that will overcome the world. Amen. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead in you, oh come on musicians, he says he will quicken your mort if that same spell in you. He that is in us is greater than our sickness, our fear, than our temptation, than our failure, than our tumors, than our pain, than our sickness. Father, can you say amen to that? and our lack, our poverty, our failures, our problems. He knows what we feel and he knows how it feels. So don't you cry again because he knows how it feels. He knows how it feels. Hallelujah. He knows how it feels. Amen. And he will comfort you when you think no other [Applause] kind. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Come on, let us stand and worship him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Isn't he a wonderful savior? Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're going to sing, Lord, I lift your name on Hallelujah.
