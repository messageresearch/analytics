[17:59] his oxygen went too low around 26 and
[18:03] doctors say it would have affected
[18:04] organs
[18:05] ox january
[18:12] is
[18:14] the lungs are also in bad shape but god
[18:16] is working on him since oxygen is
[18:18] improved
[18:19] a lot now
[18:23] regardless
[18:25] [Music]
[18:40] he also knows the message but he hasn't
[18:42] embraced it
[18:46] his wife is my mom's sister
[18:48] [Music]
[18:52] and he says that she's also very strong
[18:55] in christ
[18:59] yeah she has never you know wore
[19:01] trousers or stuff like that
[19:03] i am barranga comparison turned away

[19:06] she naturally loves gold katie mo but on
[19:08] the

[19:28] and so brother tim requests that uh
[19:32] we pray for this anchor of his
[19:35] team again but uh
[19:39] because his uncle is now
[19:43] in the hospital
[19:48] and he has not received the message yet
[19:54] but you know he he has known the message
[19:57] for a long time
[20:01] so i'd like us to pray for his uncle who
[20:03] is sick with conflict for the lord to
[20:04] deliver him
[20:05] but also for the lord to visit him and
[20:07] his family
[20:09] and reveal this uh message to them
[20:16] actually he did not give me a name but
[20:21] you know that this is brother tim's
[20:22] uncle so as you pray you remember
[20:25] that in prayer
[20:29] i'm going to serve
[20:38] so now there is also another prayer
[20:42] request
[20:42] what do i choke sabine coming in from
[20:47] by the team fruit chivo dairy organda
[20:50] tim fruit
[20:51] some of you who might remember but that
[20:53] improved is of course
[20:54] a pastor in the us
[20:58] improved america but some time back
[21:01] we were you know talking with him i was
[21:04] inquiring
[21:05] from him regarding a certain scripture
[21:12] and you know he told me of his con
[21:16] wife's condition how she was sick
[21:21] and he asked us to pray now
[21:24] it was at that time that you know the
[21:26] spirit of the lord came upon me
[21:28] to say that and gave me
[21:31] you know an inspiration for them and i
[21:34] sent out a few words
[21:35] to him
[21:39] prophetic words and part of it
[21:44] was saying that you know god will give
[21:47] them
[21:47] a series of victories
[21:55] and ever since that time
[22:00] his wife has had three brain bleeds
[22:09] yes and now this time she has had
[22:12] another attack
[22:16] and i i would just like to take a moment
[22:19] and read
[22:20] this to you so you can have also pick a
[22:23] burden to
[22:24] really remember
[22:30] [Music]
[22:38] he says on june 29th my wife sister
[22:40] karen pruitt
[22:41] was hospitalized for yet another brain
[22:43] bleach
[22:52] it seems that her blood pressure was
[22:54] will spike for some
[22:55] unknown reason which causes a brain uh
[22:59] which causes bleed a bleed in the brain
[23:06] again
[23:17] you know it brings some kind of
[23:18] confusion and being slow to process
[23:35] five days she still sleeps a lot and you
[23:37] know
[23:38] she cannot even eat well
[23:41] no no
[23:44] and he says if she does not if she does
[23:47] not eat well
[23:48] again they will have to incubate her to
[23:53] put a tube so that she can be able to
[23:55] eat through a tube
[23:56] again
[24:01] and that of course requires a lot of
[24:03] things
[24:05] saving to injury uh so you can see
[24:09] and then he says um please join together
[24:12] in prayer
[24:13] again time be to trigger
[25:09] because it says our prayer request for
[25:10] today includes not only her complete
[25:13] healing
[25:14] and restoration but for an immediate
[25:16] touch so that a feeding tube
[25:18] will not be necessary to save

[54:22] normally when we read the word i know we
[54:24] stand so you may be seated
[54:30] praise be to god yeah this morning i'm
[54:33] going to take my inspiration from the
[54:35] message
[54:35] as i thought on
[55:18] m
[55:24] okay yeah psalms 46
[55:28] the priyana mukam reading the first
[55:31] verse summary
[55:32] lord is our refuge and strength
[55:36] our very present hope psalms 46
[55:40] god is our refuge and strength
[55:43] a very present hope in trouble
[56:07] god is our refuge and strength a very
[56:10] present hope
[56:11] in trouble therefore will not with fear
[56:15] though the earth be moved and though the
[56:18] mountain
[56:19] be carried into the middle of the sea
[56:56] and strength
[57:11] the prophet says that the sun is
[57:13] believed that by the clergy
[57:20] no the sun is believed by the clergy
[57:30] by the historian that david cried out
[57:33] this when his house was being washed by
[57:36] soul
[57:36] but
[57:51] and he knew that when he went out of the
[57:53] door in the daylights
[57:58] there might be a spear or a dart
[58:01] an arrow driven through his back
[58:20] his hands
[58:48] amen and usually it's when men are in
[58:51] trouble
[58:52] that they turn to god
[58:58] that is that is human too
[59:01] when we are okay
[59:26] he thinks that by being fine or not
[59:28] having any pain in his body
[59:44] praise be to god
[1:00:07] [Applause]
[1:00:13] [Applause]
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:18] [Applause]
[1:00:53] that is the first thing they think of
[1:00:55] doing is calling on him
[1:00:59] praise be to god are you also like that
[1:01:02] this morning
[1:01:05] hallelujah he said that
[1:01:09] men always say agaman
[1:01:12] gamba now there is no god uh and i
[1:01:15] believe you have also met them
[1:01:17] is the name of the synchrony somebody
[1:01:20] will say there is no god
[1:01:27] [Applause]
[1:02:46] is
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:03:00] god
[1:03:07] [Applause]
[1:03:39] but you will never receive god and truly
[1:03:42] because speak
[1:03:44] [Applause]
[1:03:56] then
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:17] [Applause]
[1:04:23] praise be to god
[1:04:28] [Applause]

[1:08:28] praise be to god i want the kind of
[1:08:31] spirit
[1:08:32] which is in the heart
[1:08:35] because sometimes even wicked people
[1:08:37] when they are in critical condition
[1:08:45] some of them start to clean their lives
[1:09:02] [Music]
[1:09:32] then they turned to god oh i choked on
[1:09:35] that i have had many people laugh
[1:09:36] and say there's no god
[1:09:41] but when they get in trouble
[1:09:44] that is the first thing they think of
[1:09:46] doing
[1:09:49] calling on him praise be to god
[1:09:53] that is the way it is we try to make on
[1:09:58] all kinds of promises we try to make

[1:13:33] become visible when they would leave
[1:13:34] god for a season but rather i can't say
[1:13:37] that
[1:13:38] and get in trouble they would always
[1:13:42] scream
[1:13:42] out to god
[1:14:11] seemingly to do that
[1:14:15] look like they enjoy coming to the lord
[1:14:17] that is so quickly forgotten
[1:14:24] we have seen the hand of god enough in
[1:14:26] these meetings
[1:14:40] meetings
[1:14:54] we
[1:15:23] hallelujah hallelujah you say they
