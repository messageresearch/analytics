[30:54] [Music]
[31:05] Shall we
[31:07] pray? Lord Jesus, we sing this because
[31:10] we know you are
[31:13] faithful. You're worthy of our
[31:16] [Music]
[31:18] praise. Lord, you are worthy of our
[31:21] time. And we have come, Lord, in this
[31:24] place to gather together.
[31:26] [Music]
[31:28] because we want to honor
[31:31] you. We know that you are the source of
[31:34] our
[31:36] being and we live to you and for you
[31:41] Lord and we are asking oh God that you
[31:44] come and bless us this evening by your

[32:00] heart that we may hear from

[32:19] Amen. Amen. God bless you church.
[32:24] I want to greet you in the name of Jesus
[32:26] Christ.
[32:28] Amen.
[32:30] Shall we open our Bibles to the book of
[32:32] Numbers, chapter 11?
[32:47] And uh we'll just carry on try to carry
[32:50] on from where we stopped on
[32:55] Sunday. It's always a blessing and an
[32:58] honor to speak to the children of
[33:03] God and I trust that um God will
[33:06] minister to our hearts.
[33:11] We are beginning. We will just read that
[33:13] portion just to remind ourselves of the
[33:15] portion we
[33:17] [Music]
[33:19] read 11 in numbers
[33:28] 11:10. Then Moses had the people weep
[33:32] throughout the their families, every man
[33:34] in the in the door of his tent. And the
[33:37] anger of the Lord was kindled greatly.
[33:39] Moses also was displeased. And Moses
[33:43] said unto the the thy unto the Lord,
[33:46] "Wherefore has thou afflicted thy
[33:48] servant, and wherefore have I not found
[33:50] favor in thy sight, that thou layst the
[33:54] burden of all these people upon me? Have
[33:56] I conceived all these people? Have I
[33:59] begotten them that thou shouldest say
[34:01] unto me, Carry them in thy bosom? As a
[34:04] nursing father beareth the sacking child
[34:07] um unto the land which thou soest unto
[34:11] their fathers? Whence should I have
[34:14] flesh to give unto all these people? For
[34:17] they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh
[34:20] that we may eat. I am not able to bear
[34:23] all these people alone because it is too
[34:25] heavy for me. And if thou deal thus with
[34:28] me, kill me, I pray thee, out of out of
[34:31] hand, if I have found favor in thy
[34:34] sight, and let me not see my
[34:46] wretchedness.
[34:55] [Music]
[34:57] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign
[35:07] speech.
[35:26] Fore speech.
[35:44] [Music]
[36:00] Amen. You may be seated at
[36:03] church. I just want to uh appreciate all
[36:07] the brothers, the sisters that are here
[36:11] today and especially, you know, we
[36:15] usually have uh the brothers that
[36:21] minister every
[36:23] service, the
[36:25] musicians. Brother Marvin is always very
[36:28] faithful there.
[36:31] And uh by the way there is um one one
[36:34] service here that you know brother Maven
[36:36] has had a dead laptop for a while for
[36:38] years
[36:42] actually which was giving a lot of
[36:45] trouble and when we wanted to project
[36:47] some things it was really
[36:52] disturbing but um one day we mentioned
[36:55] here
[36:59] um And there was someone
[37:03] streaming, a sister who is not even a
[37:06] member of this
[37:08] church, but uh she was
[37:11] moved. I think she occasionally streams
[37:14] our
[37:17] services and she brought a brand new
[37:21] laptop over that for the for the for
[37:24] that uh projection.
[37:28] uh that sister may God bless
[37:31] her and certainly she will see the
[37:33] blessing of God in what she does.
[37:37] Amen. You know sometimes a need is
[37:40] spoken and you know I believe that
[37:42] that's how you know God should
[37:46] provide. Amen. And we appreciate all the
[37:50] media
[37:52] department that work on the
[37:55] camera, the
[37:56] deacons, the music
[37:59] department.
[38:01] Uh I I've also realized we don't usually
[38:03] appreciate our
[38:06] interpreter. How many appreciate our
[38:10] interpreter? Amen. God bless you. And
[38:14] and song leaders
[38:15] and these people are doing a good job.
[38:19] And we really appreciate you know
[38:21] ministry cannot be done
[38:24] u
[38:27] single-handedly you know be it a huge
[38:29] church or small
[38:32] church you need um people that really
[38:36] are committed to the
[38:39] word with ministry it's all about
[38:44] commitment and consistence
[38:49] Because you know the sisters that sing
[38:51] here, God bless
[38:53] you. You know, sometimes you you you
[38:55] don't know uh if someone does something
[38:58] very well and they do it only one
[39:03] time, it doesn't really mean
[39:05] much. But if someone consistently does
[39:12] something then they they are really
[39:15] making
[39:17] impact. Not all the times we come to
[39:19] preach here we feel like
[39:23] preaching. It's a post of
[39:26] duty and we know it's a responsibility
[39:29] that the Lord places on
[39:32] you and it must be accomplished.
[39:37] Not every time you you you come to
[39:39] church, you really feel like coming to
[39:43] church. When you see ah it's service
[39:46] time.
[39:48] You know even when you feel weak and
[39:50] maybe tired or whatever you somehow push
[39:54] yourself. You know why some feel that
[39:57] way is because we are wearing this
[40:01] body. Our soul has the hunger and the
[40:03] thirst and the desire.
[40:07] But our body usually has other
[40:10] plans. But we have to put this flesh
[40:12] under
[40:14] subjection. This evening I'm dealing
[40:16] with I am but a man part
[40:22] two. Uh on a man under divine
[40:28] assignment. We remind oursel of Numbers
[40:31] 11 where God where Moses was speaking
[40:34] with God.
[40:39] You see when when God when when God
[40:41] calls a
[40:43] man as I showed you and demonstrated for
[40:46] you on
[40:47] Sunday, it's not always the man has the
[40:51] ability to do what God has called him to
[40:52] do.
[40:57] It's not always that that man is um
[41:00] fitting the
[41:03] job. Many times that man has no uh
[41:08] [Music]
[41:10] requirements you know or what on Sunday
[41:12] we called
[41:15] qualification. But you see, if God calls
[41:19] you into doing
[41:21] something, you know, God himself will
[41:24] qualify
[41:26] you. And we saw that there are many
[41:28] different
[41:30] ministries callings and you know
[41:33] different
[41:35] gifts
[41:38] administrations you know I've mentioned
[41:39] a few
[41:40] already you know we also went to homes
[41:43] and
[41:44] families being a father being a mother
[41:47] being you know um uh Sunday
[41:51] school Sunday school or media
[41:57] apartment. It's a a responsibility that
[42:00] God has called you to
[42:02] do. Even to be a
[42:05] Christian, to be a
[42:07] believer is a responsibility that God
[42:10] has called you to
[42:11] do. But you see um many times we feel
[42:14] that God has called us to to to dress
[42:17] something that is too big for
[42:22] us. Even being a pastor,
[42:25] I never in my life ever thought I would
[42:27] ever be a
[42:29] pastor. At least I thought that I will
[42:32] be a traveling
[42:35] evangelist, you know, and you know cuz I
[42:37] enjoyed going
[42:39] around and you know starting new things
[42:41] and going here, going
[42:43] there. But when I became a pastor for
[42:45] the first time in
[42:48] Ethiopia, God surprised me and I
[42:51] actually thought I was not qualified for
[42:52] that.
[42:55] people who knew me when they came later
[42:56] in
[42:59] this what you mean you you you've
[43:04] been you've done this
[43:06] you and then you would not even want to
[43:08] say yes because you know surely you do
[43:12] not qualify to
[43:14] accomplish anything you would know that
[43:17] it is you were just there when God was
[43:19] doing
[43:21] it let me tell you When God sets to use
[43:26] you, if it is God using
[43:29] you, you will know it is not you who did
[43:32] it. You were just there when God was
[43:35] doing
[43:37] it. But when you see a man or a woman
[43:40] saying it's me that did
[43:43] it, there is a problem with his
[43:47] calling. They say that God never used
[43:51] him or this man just used, you know,
[43:54] went about trying to exercise his own
[43:57] [Music]
[43:59] abilities. But man's abilities will
[44:02] always
[44:03] fail. But God God is ability in you
[44:06] cannot
[44:10] fail. If he has called you for
[44:13] something to be a father to be a husband
[44:16] to be a wife that cannot fail there are
[44:20] many things that can come about around
[44:22] it to make to look like as if it's going
[44:24] to
[44:27] fail. But Jesus said on this rock I'll
[44:31] be with my
[44:32] child and the gates of hell shall not
[44:34] prevail
[44:35] against. So that simply means the gates
[44:38] of hell will be against you.
[44:42] If you are the church, the gates of hell
[44:45] will be against
[44:46] you. If you are called to do what you're
[44:49] doing to if you want to know you are
[44:51] called
[44:53] by you will see by how the enemy or the
[44:56] gates of hell will open up to try and
[44:58] swallow you and make you go away from
[45:00] your
[45:05] calling. But you see the Bible gave us a
[45:08] promise.
[45:10] Jesus, he say the gates of
[45:12] hell will not prevail
[45:15] against. You see, so whatever
[45:19] responsibility, however difficult it is,
[45:22] whatever
[45:24] assignment, however difficult it is, if
[45:27] it is God who has given it to
[45:29] you, the gates of hell cannot prevail
[45:33] against. And so Moses
[45:36] here found the people weeping.
[45:39] and all their
[45:41] families. Here is a man that God had
[45:43] spoken
[45:45] to. And this man, God told him, "Go to
[45:48] the land of
[45:49] Egypt. I want you to bring my people to
[45:51] a land that I promised
[45:54] Moses. You Moses will do it. I will
[45:58] anoint you to do
[45:59] it. You alone, you are the one who is
[46:02] able to do it." And Moses felt he did
[46:05] not qualify.
[46:07] He gave many
[46:08] excuses. He said I don't have the
[46:11] ability. I I
[46:13] stammer. I I I I am old. I really really
[46:19] really even my training is evaporated
[46:24] and you know my youth is
[46:26] gone. I can't even talk
[46:29] where you can't send me to go and and
[46:32] face an entire army.
[46:35] But you know, God did not mind about the
[46:37] excuses of
[46:40] Moses. God minded about what he
[46:44] thought, not about what Moses
[46:48] thought. So it's not about what you
[46:51] think about
[46:53] yourself. Amen. It's about what God
[46:56] thinks
[46:58] about. He has given you and me a divine
[47:01] assignment.
[47:04] And that divine assignment whether man
[47:07] thinks you can't
[47:08] accomplish whether you think you can
[47:12] accomplish. You see God thinks you can
[47:15] accomplish and you will accomplish it.
[47:19] In the way God has seen
[47:23] fit in the way man has swed
[47:27] fit. The Bible says such are the ways of
[47:31] man. And he says, "Your ways are not my
[47:34] ways. Your thoughts are not my
[47:36] thoughts." He says, "Repent of your
[47:38] ways." So it's not about our
[47:41] ways. It's about his
[47:43] way. And Moses
[47:46] accepted. So when Moses went, God of
[47:49] course told him, I will be with you and
[47:51] I will demonstrate this and I'll do
[47:54] this. So Moses had that
[47:58] confidence. He believed that God would
[48:00] perform miracles.
[48:02] He believed that supernatural things
[48:04] will
[48:06] happen that will qualify his
[48:10] ministry. God has promised
[48:13] preachers and all servants of God in
[48:16] different ministries and
[48:18] calling signs following
[48:22] them. The believer, he says, "All these
[48:25] signs shall follow
[48:28] them. They shall cast out devils. They
[48:31] they shall lay their hands on us and the
[48:33] sick shall recover. They shall you know
[48:36] you know trump serpent. They shall not
[48:39] hurt them. They shall drink poison and
[48:42] it will not hurt them. You know these
[48:44] are supernatural
[48:46] things. But I want you to see something
[48:50] that not all the
[48:51] time these things will happen in our
[48:56] ministry. Not all the time. You know,
[48:59] sometimes God allows there to be
[49:01] [Applause]
[49:03] silence until you sincerely see that I
[49:06] cannot go
[49:09] anywhere that I have
[49:11] stolen. I cannot
[49:14] continue. God promised he will provide.
[49:17] There is no provision. God promised that
[49:20] there will be miracles than one. I don't
[49:23] see them. That's the
[49:25] moment for God to prove his
[49:29] word. You should always aim and rejoice
[49:32] in your heart. Whenever you see things
[49:34] are
[49:35] difficult, whenever you see you don't
[49:37] have an answer, whenever you see you are
[49:40] confused about your calling, that's the
[49:43] moment to say, I am rejoicing in my
[49:46] heart because I know this one thing. God
[49:49] called me. He must come and prove his
[49:53] word.
[49:55] Amen. Because I am under divine
[49:57] assist. I have no ability of my own. I
[50:01] am but a
[50:03] man. I'm just a man. God himself must
[50:07] prove he is God. And that he sent me and
[50:12] he cannot
[50:13] ashame. So Moses came to a point where
[50:17] the children of Israel started you know
[50:20] weeping not crying
[50:24] weeping. Why were they weeping? They
[50:27] were weeping throughout their
[50:29] families young and old and
[50:32] everybody men in their doors and tents
[50:36] and they were weeping because they
[50:38] didn't have
[50:40] meat. They had eaten beans and and
[50:44] whatever so long
[50:46] and well they didn't even have
[50:48] beans. They they had eaten you know
[50:52] these kind of things. I don't know how
[50:53] they call them
[50:55] mana so long
[50:58] and you know like what you would call
[51:00] today
[51:03] beans. You are saying God called you but
[51:06] your children are all eating beans and
[51:10] pork every day every day. every day.
[51:13] Every day until now they all begin
[51:16] complaining until the whole house goes
[51:18] on
[51:19] fire. Now that if you say that God
[51:21] called
[51:24] you, why are we eating beans?
[51:27] Unfortunately, can we have some meat?
[51:30] And and when Moses came and saw what was
[51:33] going on, you know, he realized the
[51:35] Bible says that the God the anger of the
[51:37] Lord was kind.
[51:41] So God was angry. Meaning God does not
[51:44] like his children
[51:49] murmuring. God doesn't want you to
[51:52] mama. He wants you to
[51:55] believe. Even when you have no
[51:58] answer. A believer believes even when
[52:01] they have no
[52:04] answer. That's the difference between an
[52:07] unbeliever and a believer.
[52:10] You know a believer if you want to know
[52:12] whether you a believer or
[52:15] not be in a situation where you have no
[52:19] answer where you can't answer the
[52:22] unbeliever where you can't prove what
[52:24] you believe where you are
[52:27] confused where things are
[52:30] difficult but it is it's loose like your
[52:32] life is going aside you you believe the
[52:35] word but it's not happening.
[52:39] If you are in that
[52:40] situation,
[52:42] congratulations. You can now prove
[52:44] whether you're a believer or
[52:46] not. The believer will stand
[52:49] still no matter
[52:52] what. You
[52:55] remember they said whether whether we
[52:58] die or we live we will not bow. We will
[53:03] not bend. But we know he's more than
[53:06] able to deliver us from the fire. But
[53:10] even if he does not deliver us, we will
[53:12] not bow. We will
[53:15] not. That's how every believer in every
[53:19] age stood. And that's how we are
[53:22] standing
[53:24] today. When things are
[53:26] tough, good, easy,
[53:29] difficult, we
[53:31] stand, we are believers. Tell your
[53:34] neighbor we are believers.
[53:37] Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[53:41] Yes. That's the true
[53:44] gospel. And so we see that Moses was a
[53:48] believer and the people were believers.
[53:51] But the people murmured. And because
[53:54] they murmured, God was angry. And when
[53:58] God became
[53:59] angry, Moses also was displeased.
[54:03] So, so Moses was
[54:06] displeased. He was displeased because
[54:08] people were
[54:09] murmuring, but he was displeased also
[54:11] because God did not come through for
[54:17] him. And he was wondering, why should I
[54:20] be the one to
[54:23] worry? Why should I be worried yet I'm
[54:25] just a
[54:28] servant? Why is God afflicting me with
[54:30] this worry?
[54:34] If I found favor in his
[54:36] sight, why is he laying the burden of
[54:39] all these people upon me? Me
[54:43] only did I conceive them in my
[54:46] womb? Did I give birth to
[54:49] them? Why should I carry them?
[54:53] How should I nurse them all by myself as
[54:57] if I'm the one to suck to give them
[54:59] sucking as a sucking child rather
[55:03] and he was
[55:05] displeased and and then he he came to
[55:08] God and he he began speaking to
[55:11] God. He said, "God, where do you want me
[55:14] to get
[55:15] meat to give all these
[55:18] people? Why do you want me to?" He was
[55:20] praying, but he was angry.
[55:25] You should know your
[55:27] God. You know when if you know
[55:30] God, it doesn't matter how you approach
[55:33] him. He just wants a contrite
[55:36] heart, a broken heart and a contrite
[55:40] spirit. That's what Moses had, but he
[55:44] was
[55:45] displeased. So you can pray when you are
[55:49] displeased and God will hear your
[55:51] prayer.
[55:55] Amen. He came to God and he said, "These
[56:00] people are coming to me. They're
[56:02] weeping. They're saying give us flesh
[56:05] that we may eat. Where will I get it
[56:09] from? I am in a desert. You found me up
[56:12] there doing my own thing. I was a little
[56:16] shepherd. I was satisfied. But you
[56:20] called me. told me, "Go for these
[56:22] people. Now I am here trapped in a
[56:26] desert with them. Where should I take
[56:29] the meat
[56:31] from?" He was he was
[56:33] displeased. And he says, "Okay, if
[56:35] you're dealing with me like
[56:37] this, kill
[56:41] me." He was just a
[56:43] man. You are just a
[56:46] human. You are just a man. But I want to
[56:49] tell you something.
[56:51] God is
[56:52] God. You are just a man, but God is
[56:57] God. Moses had to know one
[57:00] thing. I wish there was
[57:03] someone that reminded him. Moses, you
[57:07] are a man. Yes. But you are a man under
[57:10] divine assignment. Amen.
[57:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Moses
[57:18] didn't have anyone to remind him.
[57:20] But you have someone to remind you
[57:22] today. And I'm here to remind you,
[57:24] brother, sister, you are a man under
[57:26] divine
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:30] assignment. Cheer up, my brother. Cheer
[57:33] up, my sister. You are under divine
[57:36] assignment. There is the unseen one
[57:38] close to
[57:39] you. There is amen. Hallelujah. power
[57:42] around you that will steer you through
[57:45] the hard
[57:48] times. Only believe
[57:53] and God is
[57:55] God because God is God. He can do what
[57:59] no man can
[58:01] do. So when he had the prayer of
[58:03] Moses, he dispatched
[58:08] help. But all the help you need
[58:12] is still within the realm of your divine
[58:18] assignment. There is no help coming from
[58:22] heaven. There is no angels going to be
[58:24] sent your
[58:25] way. All the help you need is within
[58:28] your divine
[58:30] ascend. All the anointing you need to go
[58:32] through your
[58:34] situation has been blessed upon you. Has
[58:38] been blessed upon you. Oh my you want to
[58:41] know how you see when God came down to
[58:44] Moses and then he said and the Lord said
[58:46] to
[58:47] Moses gather unto me 70 men of the
[58:51] elders of
[58:53] Israel whom thou knowest to be the
[58:55] elders of the
[58:56] people and officers over them and bring
[59:00] them unto the tabernacle of the
[59:01] congregation that they may stand there
[59:03] with
[59:06] you.
[59:08] Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, never
[59:12] alone. Never alone. He promised never to
[59:16] leave me, you never to leave you
[59:23] alone. Never
[59:25] alone. The person you are standing with
[59:28] in this
[59:30] life is there for a
[59:33] purpose. Amen. God has said,
[59:37] Amen. stand there with him.
[59:40] Oh my let me tell you God told you know
[59:44] Elijah I have go to Zapas
[59:48] I have commanded a widow
[59:50] woman to take care of you. The widow did
[59:54] not even know
[59:56] anything. At the moment Elijah reached
[59:59] there, he was a man under a divine
[1:00:03] assignment and he was standing with
[1:00:06] somebody that was there for a
[1:00:10] purpose. The person you are standing
[1:00:12] with in your
[1:00:14] life or it could be your wife, it could
[1:00:17] be your husband. It could be your
[1:00:19] pastor. It could be your friend. It
[1:00:21] could be your brother, your sister.
[1:00:23] Amen. Let me tell you brother, you could
[1:00:25] even meet just a
[1:00:27] friend. These are all blessed there in
[1:00:30] the realm of your
[1:00:33] influence by divine
[1:00:37] assignment. You are not here by
[1:00:39] accident. You are not here by accident.
[1:00:43] You are not here by accident. You are
[1:00:45] not here by accident. Every one of you,
[1:00:48] you have been blessed here.
[1:00:51] Amen. Because there's something
[1:00:54] Amen. That God is doing it is
[1:00:57] invisible with the eyes of man. But you
[1:01:00] have to enter into the realm of the
[1:01:04] spirit. Then you're going to begin to
[1:01:06] see what no man can
[1:01:10] see. Hallelujah. Amen. I say you are not
[1:01:16] alone. Tell your neighbor. Make sure
[1:01:19] they hear you. Tell them you are not
[1:01:22] alone.
[1:01:26] [Applause]
[1:01:30] You are not alone.
[1:01:32] You are not alone. Tell them this. I am
[1:01:36] right here with you. I am blessed here
[1:01:39] by God to stand with you this hour. You
[1:01:44] don't need to be
[1:01:45] depressed. You don't need to
[1:01:47] worry. Why? Because God has anointed
[1:01:51] you.
[1:01:53] But there are people around
[1:01:55] you that are too
[1:01:59] to be your
[1:02:01] helpers. But the
[1:02:03] anointing to help you is going to come
[1:02:07] from right from
[1:02:10] you. Thou anointest my head with
[1:02:15] oil. My cup runth
[1:02:18] over. My cup runth over. Let me tell you
[1:02:22] by the virtue of the this message of the
[1:02:24] hour we are
[1:02:27] anointed. Help my brother give him good
[1:02:29] sound. We are
[1:02:31] anointed. We are anointed. We are
[1:02:34] anointed with a
[1:02:35] message. Amen. And our cup is running
[1:02:38] over. The anointing with which we are
[1:02:41] anointed is running over. Running over.
[1:02:46] Going where? To our brother next to us.
[1:02:50] You are next to us and these are our
[1:02:53] divine
[1:02:58] helpers and our divine
[1:03:02] assignment. But he said you will not
[1:03:04] work
[1:03:05] alone. God sending angels from
[1:03:08] heaven. The angels are right
[1:03:10] here. You are my angel. You are my
[1:03:14] angel. I am your
[1:03:17] angel. Amen.
[1:03:20] Glory. Moses was weeping. But when God
[1:03:23] came down, he told him, "Okay, you are
[1:03:26] saying me alone. Me alone, I will help
[1:03:30] you." But here is the
[1:03:32] help to 70
[1:03:35] men, 70
[1:03:37] elders, and then he said, "Now when God
[1:03:40] when he chose them, he brought them. It
[1:03:44] is not going to be
[1:03:46] you to pass the
[1:03:49] anointing. Listen. Listen. And I will
[1:03:52] come
[1:03:53] down and talk with you there. And I will
[1:03:56] take of the
[1:03:58] spirit which is upon
[1:04:00] you, and I will put it upon
[1:04:03] them, and they shall bear the burden of
[1:04:06] the
[1:04:07] people with you. And you will bear not
[1:04:12] thyself alone.
[1:04:15] You will no longer bear it
[1:04:17] alone. And you will say to the people,
[1:04:20] "Sanctify yourselves, and you shall eat
[1:04:23] flesh, for he have wept in the ears of
[1:04:26] the
[1:04:28] Lord. Who shall give us the flesh to
[1:04:31] eat? For it was well with us in
[1:04:34] Egypt." Therefore, the Lord will give
[1:04:37] you
[1:04:38] flesh, and he shall
[1:04:40] eat. Amen.
[1:04:44] Hallelujah. The the scripture continues,
[1:04:47] but let me first stop there. The Lord
[1:04:49] shall give you
[1:04:51] flesh and you shall
[1:04:53] eat. And you shall
[1:04:56] eat. Amen. I believe that for
[1:04:59] myself. I believe that for my brother. I
[1:05:02] believe that for
[1:05:03] you. You know, when God gave them
[1:05:06] flesh, God said, "I'll give it to you.
[1:05:10] You will eat it and you will get tired
[1:05:12] of it. He said actually it will even go
[1:05:16] through your
[1:05:18] nostrils. It will be too
[1:05:21] much an overflowing
[1:05:25] blessing. But there's something I want
[1:05:27] you to
[1:05:28] see that these
[1:05:30] people were
[1:05:32] dispatched. But the anointing was not
[1:05:36] dispatched from heaven. It will disperse
[1:05:38] from Moses
[1:05:42] himself. There is a special
[1:05:45] anointing in me for my people around
[1:05:48] me. There is a special
[1:05:51] anointing in you for the people around
[1:05:54] me. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God.
[1:05:57] Amen. And God dispatches
[1:05:59] that. Amen. Over to them. For what
[1:06:03] purpose? That they may help
[1:06:06] you. bear the
[1:06:09] burden that you will not bear the burden
[1:06:13] alone.
[1:06:15] Amen. Thank you, Lord. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:19] Psalms 121. I will lift up my
[1:06:23] eyes. From where cometh my help, my help
[1:06:27] cometh from the Lord. He made the
[1:06:30] heavens and the
[1:06:31] earth. Amen. He will not suffer thy foot
[1:06:34] to be moved.
[1:06:36] that keepeth thee will not slumber.
[1:06:40] Hallelujah.
[1:06:42] Hallelujah. Amen. My help did not come
[1:06:45] from the west. My help did not come from
[1:06:48] the south. Not come from the north. It
[1:06:51] not come from the east. My help did not
[1:06:55] come from man. My help come from a black
[1:06:58] man. From a white man, from a red man.
[1:07:02] My help will come from the Lord.
[1:07:05] If God be
[1:07:07] God, if God be God, he proved
[1:07:11] himself in generations before us. He
[1:07:14] proved himself with Moses. He proved
[1:07:17] himself with William Brana. He must
[1:07:20] prove
[1:07:21] himself in our
[1:07:24] lives. He must prove
[1:07:26] himself to be a faithful God.
[1:07:30] And that's why David cried out, "I will
[1:07:32] lift my eyes out of the hills." Where
[1:07:36] does my help come from? Where does my
[1:07:39] help come from? My help cometh from the
[1:07:42] Lord. And I want to speak to you, my
[1:07:44] brother, my sister. God will help you.
[1:07:48] God will help you. Have faith in
[1:07:52] God. Have faith in God.
[1:07:56] You better receive than say
[1:07:58] I have faith in
[1:08:02] God.
[1:08:05] Hallelujah. That widow woman had to
[1:08:08] believe. Why? She was under divine
[1:08:13] commandment. When God sends you, you are
[1:08:16] under divine
[1:08:18] assignment. The person around you. other
[1:08:22] divine
[1:08:24] commandments to help
[1:08:26] you. That's how God helps
[1:08:29] you. Help comes from the
[1:08:32] Lord. I will take the spirit which is
[1:08:34] upon
[1:08:35] you and I'll put it upon
[1:08:38] them who helped Moses not the
[1:08:45] elders. There were others around
[1:08:49] him and
[1:08:52] But these were not helping him. They
[1:08:55] were interrupting him. They were
[1:08:57] disturbing him. They thought they were
[1:09:00] anointed. But they were anointed with a
[1:09:03] different spirit of interruption of
[1:09:07] disturbing confusing. Let me tell you
[1:09:10] brother when God anoints
[1:09:13] somebody around you to support you and
[1:09:18] encourage you so that you can continue
[1:09:20] pressing
[1:09:22] on. We are in a journey my brother. We
[1:09:26] are pressing
[1:09:29] on. Encourage your brother. Encourage
[1:09:32] your
[1:09:33] sister. Don't be a
[1:09:36] disruptor. Don't be a discourager.
[1:09:39] Someone is weak. Lift them up. Encourage
[1:09:43] them. Pray for them. Encourage them.
[1:09:47] Pray for them. Invite them to church.
[1:09:50] There is something you and I can
[1:09:54] do. Amen. I am but a man. But not just a
[1:09:59] man
[1:10:04] divine. Hallelujah.
[1:10:07] Thank you Lord. And brother Bam says
[1:10:10] in the message Lord show us the father
[1:10:12] and it suffices us.
[1:10:15] Don't ever worry if God sends you you
[1:10:20] just go
[1:10:21] ahead. You just go
[1:10:23] ahead. Don't ever
[1:10:26] worry. Amen. I don't know how I can
[1:10:30] overemphasize. Don't ever
[1:10:33] worry. If God sends
[1:10:36] you, you just go
[1:10:38] ahead. God will take care of all the
[1:10:42] rest of
[1:10:44] you. Maybe you are here
[1:10:47] tonight and you don't feel like as if
[1:10:49] you're in
[1:10:50] church. But I'm telling you, open your
[1:10:53] spirit. God has a word for you.
[1:10:59] Don't ever worry.
[1:11:01] Is God sending you? Did God lead you
[1:11:04] here? Did God send you here? Where is
[1:11:07] the message of the hour? Amen. Where
[1:11:11] might be DVF? But it's more than DVF. It
[1:11:15] is the message which we are
[1:11:16] preaching. Did God send you? Did God
[1:11:19] lead you? Where? Into the ministry that
[1:11:23] you are doing for the Lord, into that
[1:11:26] marriage. Amen.
[1:11:29] into that home where you are there as a
[1:11:34] child. into that
[1:11:37] workplace where you are working into
[1:11:40] that business which you are doing into
[1:11:43] the interpretation ministry in the music
[1:11:46] ministry in the preaching ministry
[1:11:49] whatever God sent you to if God sent you
[1:11:53] don't you ever worry he will take care
[1:11:55] of all of
[1:11:57] you seek first the kingdom of
[1:12:00] God and his
[1:12:02] righteousness all other
[1:12:06] Tell your
[1:12:10] neighbor all other things.
[1:12:14] What is included there, brother? What is
[1:12:16] inside there? All other
[1:12:20] things. Everything you need, you might
[1:12:23] be needing a car. My Amen. Or you might
[1:12:26] need
[1:12:27] land. Amen. Like we need land in the
[1:12:29] church. Maybe you need to buy land for
[1:12:31] your
[1:12:32] own. Or maybe you need something else.
[1:12:36] All other
[1:12:37] things. It might be healing for your
[1:12:40] body. Maybe you need a
[1:12:43] husband and children. All other
[1:12:47] things will be
[1:12:49] added. I am reading this because I
[1:12:52] believe
[1:12:53] it. All other
[1:12:55] things will be
[1:12:57] added. Don't have to
[1:13:00] worry. God has everything.
[1:13:04] Come on believers, believe
[1:13:06] this. I said God has
[1:13:10] everything. God has
[1:13:12] everything. God has
[1:13:14] everything. As I'm preaching to you, I'm
[1:13:16] preaching to
[1:13:17] myself. God has
[1:13:19] everything. I don't have to
[1:13:22] worry. Amen. He led you. He sent
[1:13:25] you. He will take care of
[1:13:29] me. Glory. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. And
[1:13:33] brother Bam, I read this for you on in
[1:13:35] the God who is rich in
[1:13:38] mercy. He says, "I'm not much of a
[1:13:41] preacher. I don't have
[1:13:43] education enough to be qualified as a
[1:13:46] preacher. What is called a preacher in
[1:13:48] these
[1:13:49] days when experiences must be a
[1:13:51] theological
[1:13:54] experience? It must have a certain
[1:13:56] doctor's
[1:13:57] degree. I can't qualify for that." But
[1:14:00] God seeing my heart
[1:14:02] I know that I want to do something for
[1:14:05] him. I want to appreciate
[1:14:07] it. God seeing my
[1:14:11] heart seeing your
[1:14:13] heart. He knows you want to do something
[1:14:16] for
[1:14:18] me. Amen. That's why he called
[1:14:25] you. Now, questions and answers of the
[1:14:28] Holy
[1:14:29] Ghost. And this is listen I I said I
[1:14:32] think
[1:14:33] this God sent me on the
[1:14:35] field and I've seen the time where I
[1:14:38] looked like and I don't have money at
[1:14:42] all where I did have money at
[1:14:45] all. Amen. Amen. Our prophet didn't have
[1:14:48] money at
[1:14:50] all who is like
[1:14:55] brother didn't have money at
[1:14:57] all. Didn't have money at all.
[1:15:02] Let's not be
[1:15:04] quiet as if it is a sin not to have
[1:15:08] money at all.
[1:15:12] He came to that
[1:15:14] moment and I would
[1:15:16] say just pass the collection
[1:15:23] plate and the manager will come to me
[1:15:25] and
[1:15:26] say look here Billy we have $5,000 in
[1:15:30] the red
[1:15:32] tonight in the
[1:15:36] red. Have you got the money in
[1:15:38] Jeffersonville to pay
[1:15:40] it? And I would say it's all right. God
[1:15:44] sent me
[1:15:45] here or I wouldn't have to
[1:15:49] come just pass the collection.
[1:15:55] And before the meeting is
[1:15:58] over, somebody say, you know, the Lord
[1:16:02] put on my
[1:16:03] hand to give
[1:16:06] $5,000 to
[1:16:08] this
[1:16:10] first, be led to do
[1:16:16] it. Whatever you are doing, are you
[1:16:19] hearing?
[1:16:22] Whatever you are doing, be led to do
[1:16:25] it. If you are pushed into it by
[1:16:29] man, I can assure you, you will regret
[1:16:32] and
[1:16:34] cry. I assure you, but whatever God
[1:16:37] leads you
[1:16:39] to, you can never
[1:16:43] regret. You can never
[1:16:46] cry. Amen. Amen. Amen. I do not believe
[1:16:50] in pulling and begging and bombing
[1:16:56] money. I think it is wrong a wrong
[1:17:01] thing. Right. Even you, our team
[1:17:06] leaders, you don't need to beg and b and
[1:17:10] and pull for
[1:17:13] money for our land
[1:17:15] fund. You see, let these people be
[1:17:19] led. Just remind them, give them a
[1:17:22] gentle
[1:17:23] reminder. Oh, we are collecting for
[1:17:26] this. Praying that God will enable you
[1:17:29] something. You just pass the collection
[1:17:32] plate. You don't need to pull and if you
[1:17:36] don't give, I'm going to remove you from
[1:17:37] the group. If you don't do
[1:17:41] that, you're begging and
[1:17:45] pulling. And a prophet says, "I think it
[1:17:47] is a wrong
[1:17:49] thing." Even here in church, we don't
[1:17:53] say, "If you don't give
[1:17:56] him, we just pass the
[1:17:59] plane right now. Brother, if you do it,
[1:18:04] don't let me hurt your feelings.
[1:18:08] You might have the right of way from God
[1:18:10] to do
[1:18:12] it, but I'm speaking just for
[1:18:15] myself. I do not believe in
[1:18:18] it. Now, I've even known of ministers
[1:18:21] going and this will make you
[1:18:23] laugh. Says uh it says these churches,
[1:18:27] it was a big camp
[1:18:33] meeting and they took the wall
[1:18:35] afternoon.
[1:18:38] at a famous
[1:18:40] denomination, two or three of them
[1:18:43] together. That's the regular churches
[1:18:45] like our modern churches here in the
[1:18:46] city or so
[1:18:48] forth at a big
[1:18:51] convention and they took the whole
[1:18:55] afternoon standing on the
[1:18:58] platform
[1:19:00] threatening that God will destroy your
[1:19:04] crops.
[1:19:07] God will give your children
[1:19:11] pium and things like that. If you don't
[1:19:15] put money into
[1:19:20] this with this Bible before
[1:19:23] me, I said it is blasphemy to God and to
[1:19:26] his
[1:19:28] followers. If God sends
[1:19:31] you, he will take care of you.
[1:19:36] If he hasn't sent
[1:19:37] you, then let the denomination take care
[1:19:40] of
[1:19:42] it. Amen. Amen. I am so glad I can say
[1:19:46] tonight I am standing here free of
[1:19:49] denomination. I am standing here free of
[1:19:53] any. God has sent us with this message
[1:19:57] of a message restoration. And we are
[1:20:00] here to say come out of my people.
[1:20:05] This is a messenger of grace. We are not
[1:20:09] sent by
[1:20:10] denomination. We are not controlled by
[1:20:12] denomination. We are controlled by God.
[1:20:15] And he said if God sent
[1:20:17] you, he would take care of
[1:20:20] you. But if God did not send you, let
[1:20:24] the denomination take care of
[1:20:26] you. But if God sends you, he will take
[1:20:30] care of you.
[1:20:33] Whatever you are doing for the Lord, if
[1:20:35] God sent you, I don't want you to
[1:20:40] worry. God will take care of
[1:20:44] you. You may not feel qualified for the
[1:20:47] job. Moses was also felt
[1:20:50] unqualified. But this is the place that
[1:20:52] God wanted Moses to be
[1:20:55] in order for God to use him. God wanted
[1:20:59] to be the one to qualify Moses.
[1:21:02] God will qualify you my
[1:21:04] brother. God will qualify you my
[1:21:06] brother, my sister. Whatever he has
[1:21:09] purposed for
[1:21:11] you, he will qualify
[1:21:14] you. Always remember you are man or
[1:21:18] woman under
[1:21:22] divine. Praise
[1:21:24] God. Amen. And I want to uh in this 10
[1:21:27] minutes to finish
[1:21:29] now that will make it 1
[1:21:31] hour in Judges
[1:21:34] 6 we read of Gideon
[1:21:37] and and I will read quickly. And Israel
[1:21:40] was greatly impoverished because of the
[1:21:41] Medidianites. You can just read
[1:21:44] it. Israel was greatly impoverished
[1:21:46] because of the Midian.
[1:21:50] And the children of Israel cried unto
[1:21:51] the Lord. And it came to pass when the
[1:21:55] children of Israel cried unto the
[1:21:57] Lord because of the Medidionites that
[1:22:00] the Lord sent a prophet unto the
[1:22:03] children of
[1:22:04] Israel, which said unto them, thus saith
[1:22:07] the Lord God of
[1:22:08] Israel, and brought you up from
[1:22:11] Egypt, and brought you up from the house
[1:22:14] of
[1:22:14] bondage, and delivered you out of the
[1:22:17] hand of
[1:22:18] Egypt, and out of the hand of
[1:22:21] oppression, and drove them out from
[1:22:23] before you, and I gave you their land.
[1:22:27] And I said unto you, I am the Lord your
[1:22:30] God, fear not the God of the
[1:22:32] land, in whose land you dwell, but ye
[1:22:36] have not obeyed my
[1:22:37] voice because they did not obey God's
[1:22:41] voice. The Medidianites impoverished
[1:22:45] them. You know God has also
[1:22:48] come and he sent us a prophet but people
[1:22:52] have not
[1:22:54] obeyed and because they have not obeyed
[1:22:57] the
[1:22:58] voice you know medianites have overtaken
[1:23:01] their
[1:23:03] life their
[1:23:05] families their
[1:23:06] churches their
[1:23:09] spaces and you know this is what God
[1:23:13] does is that when he's going to move and
[1:23:16] do
[1:23:17] something. He comes to an individual who
[1:23:20] is
[1:23:22] [Music]
[1:23:23] unqualified. And so, and there came an
[1:23:26] angel of the
[1:23:28] Lord. Amen. May God send angels in your
[1:23:33] life. If you want angels to appear to
[1:23:37] you, put good music in your
[1:23:40] home.
[1:23:42] Pray and wait upon the Lord.
[1:23:46] Read the word med upon
[1:23:48] it. Angels will show
[1:23:51] up. And there came an angel of the Lord.
[1:23:54] And he sat on an
[1:23:59] oak that pertained unto Josh the Abzite.
[1:24:07] And his son Gideon threshed wheat by the
[1:24:12] white to hide it.
[1:24:15] under the wine uh the the the wine press
[1:24:18] tried from the medianite.
[1:24:21] And the angel of the Lord appeared unto
[1:24:23] him and he said unto him, "The
[1:24:27] Lord is with thee." Now, I want you to
[1:24:31] listen to these words. And when you hear
[1:24:33] them, ascribe it to you
[1:24:37] personally. The Lord is with
[1:24:40] thee. Hear them and see if you can
[1:24:42] believe it.
[1:24:44] The Lord is with me. Thou mighty man
[1:24:50] of Gideon said unto him, "Oh my
[1:24:54] Lord, if the Lord be with
[1:24:57] us, why then is all this befallen
[1:25:01] us? Where have we
[1:25:04] lost? And where be all his
[1:25:08] miracles which our fathers told us
[1:25:11] of? Did not the Lord bring us from
[1:25:15] Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us
[1:25:18] and delivered us into the hand of the
[1:25:20] Midian. I want to tell you this
[1:25:23] evening, God has not
[1:25:25] forsaken. That's why he's speaking to
[1:25:27] you
[1:25:28] tonight. You are not here by
[1:25:31] accident. Amen. He has not forsaken you.
[1:25:35] God left you alone. God is still
[1:25:37] interested in you. God is still
[1:25:42] concerned. God is still on your
[1:25:46] case. Stop Amen.
[1:25:48] crying. Quit
[1:25:50] weeping. Start hearing what the angel is
[1:25:55] saying. When is the angel speaking? The
[1:25:58] angel speaking right
[1:26:00] now. Hallelujah. And the Lord looked
[1:26:04] upon him and
[1:26:06] said,
[1:26:08] "Goon, go in thy
[1:26:10] might, go in this thy
[1:26:13] mind. This this thy mind might do you
[1:26:16] feel the might." You feel weak. But the
[1:26:20] angel is saying, "This thy
[1:26:23] might, oh your weakness will be made
[1:26:28] strain, says the spirit of
[1:26:31] God. and thou shalt save
[1:26:34] Israel from the hand of the
[1:26:37] Medionite. Have I not sent
[1:26:40] thee? Have I? The angel says, "Have I
[1:26:43] not
[1:26:44] saved?" And he said unto him, "Oh my
[1:26:47] Lord, wherewith shall I serve
[1:26:50] Israel? Behold, my family is
[1:26:53] poor in Manasse, and I am the least in
[1:26:57] my father's
[1:26:59] house." You think you are poor? You
[1:27:02] think you are the least of you think you
[1:27:04] have nothing in your life. You can
[1:27:07] accomplish nothing in this
[1:27:10] life. Open your ears of
[1:27:13] understanding and listen to what the
[1:27:14] Lord has
[1:27:16] said. And the Lord said unto him, Surely
[1:27:20] I will be with thee, and thou shalt
[1:27:24] smite thou shalt smite the Medidionites
[1:27:28] as one man.
[1:27:33] Yes sir. You will smite Israel, the
[1:27:36] Medidionites as one
[1:27:38] man. You the one who thinks you are
[1:27:42] weak. You the one who thinks you are
[1:27:45] despised. You see no power. You see no
[1:27:48] future
[1:27:49] in God is saying to you tonight. I am
[1:27:53] not preaching. I'm prophesying.
[1:27:55] God is saying to you tonight, he will
[1:27:58] use you to smite your enemies. The
[1:28:03] enemies that have afflicted your
[1:28:06] family, the enemies that have afflicted
[1:28:09] your
[1:28:09] home, your clan, you as one man, you as
[1:28:15] one woman, God is able to use
[1:28:18] you. You smite them. You smite them. You
[1:28:23] smite
[1:28:26] them. You're going to smite them. You're
[1:28:29] going to destroy them.
[1:28:31] You already have the
[1:28:33] anointing. Believe it in the name of our
[1:28:35] Lord Jesus. I am
[1:28:37] anointed to slay my enemy, to slay my
[1:28:40] sickness, to slay my
[1:28:43] poverty. The man said is poor. You may
[1:28:46] be poor. It doesn't matter whether you
[1:28:49] are
[1:28:51] poor. Hallelujah. God is
[1:28:54] faithful. God is
[1:28:56] faithful. Stand up and begin to say your
[1:28:59] name.
[1:29:00] Stand up and begin to slay your
[1:29:03] enemies. Amen. Close your eyes and
[1:29:07] see. Slay your enemies of
[1:29:10] fear. Slay your enemies of sickness.
[1:29:14] Slay your enemies of poverty. Slay your
[1:29:16] enemies of
[1:29:17] unbelief. Believe in the word of
[1:29:19] God. Believe in the words of the
[1:29:22] enemy. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:29:25] yesterday, today and forever. The
[1:29:28] enemies you see today, you will not see
[1:29:31] them here.
[1:29:32] For the Lord is rising up. The Lord is
[1:29:35] rising
[1:29:36] upon you in great power, in great grace,
[1:29:42] to give you your enemies. He's anointing
[1:29:45] you to smite your enemies. He's
[1:29:48] anointing you to overcome this year.
[1:29:51] He's anointing
[1:29:53] you to live as an overcomer.
[1:29:57] It doesn't matter how weak you
[1:29:59] feel. It doesn't matter how sluggish you
[1:30:02] feel. You may be powerless you
[1:30:06] think. You may be weak. You think you
[1:30:09] may be sinful. You think you may be
[1:30:12] feeble and
[1:30:13] sick. But listen, listen.
[1:30:17] God has allowed for you to feel
[1:30:21] unequalified because he wants to qualify
[1:30:28] you. He can give you back your strength.
[1:30:32] He can restore you when you are
[1:30:34] weak. He can anoint you when you are
[1:30:36] feeble.
[1:30:38] He is faithful.
[1:30:41] He is faithful.
[1:30:43] He is loving.
[1:30:45] He is kind. He's compassionate.
[1:30:48] He understands.
[1:30:50] And he's here tonight.
[1:30:52] Receive him in your heart, will you?
[1:30:58] Thank you, Lord.

[1:43:43] man, but we are under a divine
[1:43:48] assignment. Impress that revelation upon
[1:43:51] each of
[1:43:52] us as
[1:43:54] individuals. You've sent us
[1:43:58] help just around about us.
[1:44:01] Father Lord, as we dismiss
[1:44:04] tonight, dismiss us with your
[1:44:06] love and also bless the givers that are
