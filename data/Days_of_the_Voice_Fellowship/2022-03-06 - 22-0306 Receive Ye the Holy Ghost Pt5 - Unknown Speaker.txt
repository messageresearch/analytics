lifting up our hands this morning where are you done [Music] [Music] and we are going to the book of genesis once again this is part 5 of the series that we've been speaking on receiving the holy ghost and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slapped and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in instead they arrove and the re which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now one of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she has been taken out of the man then [Music] [Music] is and uh then here we see that she was taken out of the man one two 11 this man in the image of god her name was woman meaning he says and the lord god formed man out of the dust of the ground breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became [Music] i want to greet you all in the precious name of jesus christ my name is christian blessing and a privilege to be in the house of the lord this morning the different ones that are coming to fellowship that have come to fellowship with us this morning um my brother i i missed your name michael brother yesterday i believe you should be the brother to brother caleb i can see the resemblance on the face it's wonderful you know you've been away for a long time fortunately was your first time this other one to be here yeah that sunday the other sunday was it not his first time sunday with this okay it wasn't your first time okay well welcome back again yeah everybody come out amen today is a special day i don't know but uh as always i always want to just approach the world immediately directly and then we can always do the rest of the announcements and everything later every second to recording that it is brother amos amen i mean i'm happy to see you this morning now if i said something new that maybe perhaps you may not follow me well uh this is part five and all the other parts are on there online if you feel so desire the desire to go and follow up every time amen i mean praise the name of the lord come and give us the word i said praise the name of god come and give us away how many have come to have churches i've kept on reading over and over whenever we read it we have a little more inspiration and so uh on wednesday i was dealing with the blood then then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you you can islamic 2019. yes amen i mean and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side now while we are still reading john 20 and that's i hope i hope i don't lose any of you i want you to follow me close this is a very sensitive scripture everyone requires and my prayers that you will receive a revelation now i want you to open your hearts as we are still reading here not just someone i want us to look at what we have read now i i know you you can have you if you have a bible you can open it back both ways well i want us to look at john 20 and look at genesis and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall on adam adam i don't know about that brother you can be able to put those scriptures together two different windows and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall on adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs and closed up up the flesh instead they wrote and out of that sleep god took out a rib out of his skull he made a woman are you following me and here the lord comes from the resurrection [Music] after the suppose someone is about to have a wife why do you want again the fool of machado peace be unto you someone is about to have a wife adam peacefully went to sleep and the lord god calls the deep sleep and then after that he says he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead they're wrong [Music] hallelujah and so in the strength he says and and when he had so said when he had so sad peace be unto you i might as well say when adam had it was very identical to the side of adam why when god created the adam please follow me here and i would say bring this foundation here for cattle that we are turned adam he spoke a word are you following me oh my there many revelations going through my mind right now i pray that you will open your mind to receive it stories in the bible [Music] is m so in genesis 1 god coming down and he creates man by the spoken word so where was man before he was created you could not see him physically because he was in the image of god commanded him god is a spirit on the moon was the spirit guard he told them never come back go and murder amen he came down and he breathed nassar on the nose on the nostrils of his mouth yes my mind immediately was running to john chapter 20. yes verse 19. he says he says peace be still peace be unto you and then he says save you the holy ghost all right all right let's take it a little slow here then he says then jesus said unto them again yes after he had showed them [Music] then jesus said to them again yes peace be unto you as my father sent me next time even so send are you manga remember and then when he had said this when he had saved me so wasn't something they were going to struggle for the challenge it was a must for them to receive the holy ghost and this is what i want to learn you're still following me all right now we notice that jesus yes [Music] in genesis chapter 2 he says to this man he had molded out of the dust of the creature he actually says to that man the same thing jesus said to me when he rose from the crowd yesterday want you to understand here that by the time jesus breathed his breath jesus yes would not breathe on the people resurrection they could not receive it the ad can only be received when he when it is before the fall in other words you can only be in that image explaining it to yourself achieving them before the fall you can only be in the image of god who shall deliver [Applause] yesterday [Music] oh that has not maybe manifested in you in a greater way you find the thief they are beating oh sorry you are born that way now i shall reward you we were the fifth on the cross [Music] all of us were saved because of the way we were born you have to work on this i wanted to look at genesis 2 once again of the lord and the lord and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man original gamba mukamaka their body was compromised and their blood was compromised they needed a correction they needed a correction some they needed to have a correction and the only way that there could be a correction it was for a sinless man hallelujah you and i probably several times that the reason why jesus came was to die on the cross and the reason why he died was because he wanted to redeem it and only there are some souls in this world that are not redeemable because they do not have the seed of god no matter what you do they can never and that means his children also were in his image meaning in the image of god a child of god is um i always speak for an hour i hope that that would be to about 12. so by one i'll be done hallelujah i mean so i wanted to follow me with all your chickens and so adam adam was then his nature was perverted and all his children were perverted by chiama oh does not redemption of your soul oh more enemies if you are truly redeemed must follow your life hallelujah amen and we see here from grace jesus and jesus yes would not breathe on them before they are redeemed they were jews they had done their works and you do [Music] it's so fast to judge him and when he passed that man he said all right it's not only that there is more why don't oh amen i mean all the prophets but not people now they're just there by the way to stand in the garden where the real deal was coming through amen i mean all the other prophets actually pointing [Music] i have found it who my soul has longed for you jesus was the one all the prophets spoke about yes jesus is the center of the bible yes who [Music] he was born without see his harry potter tv he was born perfect who was it he had childhood the first man adam baby soul yeti [Music] is to make it functional hallelujah amen and so when jesus yes you went oh glory to god he went on the cross when he was talking on the cross that blood i want no messiah and that what am i saying that came out the amazon came as a price it was the payments that was required and when he killed all of them down the line and i would never take away your batter he thought he had resisted the seed of god that god is a creator and he can create [Music] he was the manifestation of god yes amen amen that would stand between death and mankind when i say mankind one day [Music] every the water in tibet for woody chicago that one must change the chicago chile if they are the seed let me tell you the spirit of god it is not a maybe synthesizer it is a mask hallelujah amen jesus yes did not look at the disciples and tell them let [Music] but revelations oh that you believe in him who killed his son that man on the throne he was more than a man yeah to take us out [Music] [Music] because i'm having fun [Music] for something hallelujah amen we don't need to be the traitors are created by baptism christians and we have made this message look as if it is another religion that the only thing that separates us from the other about what [Music] apostolic without having you know excitement yes [Music] [Music] from all amen the things that were amen are hipped upon us because of sin and then what does this redemption do he has always been sending redemption the revelation of the redemption are you following me hallelujah amen they received a prophet i thought i should [Music] many people end there about they only eat the flesh of the world but they forget that it's also the blood evidence why do you know messiah eat it all eat it all teaching establishes us in christ but then teaching doesn't make us cross the jordan we need teaching and a little more no question are you following me now we find that these people around you they were eating the bloody word of the son of man by anybody or moving you can never receive the holy ghost [Music] give me that one [Music] and then when that happens a lot of what sucks oh my gosh it's a bigger temptation as a young man you needed to think whether goku was on how to buy a paper and get your own popular other paper and you this social media younger than two it's the end of the day going over you know you know the uh homes of people and i told you now that homosexuality is [Applause] hallelujah [Music] [Applause] we have heard the message shalom and all this way [Applause] you believe that don't you [Music] [Applause] little bright [Applause] m okay [Music] let glory amen that will receive the redemption praise the name of the lord hallelujah hallelujah but i'm saying in the message is running so fast by the believers they went out and entered into the promised land hallelujah amen they went under the anointed message of the message they went [Music] there [Music] amen that was moving in there but they had the land but death was moving over the house of israel hallelujah amen it will save what you the bottles that's why we do not sell oil that's why we don't sell water they don't ruin them that's why we don't sell nothing because you have the power like i do what is the ministry of reconciliation must receive the word he told us substances many more things god revealed will andy said check it out with the world now listen to good and repent oh and be baptized in the name oh the lord jesus christ he shall receive the holy ghost note many these hands and his signs his signs for all of them you know when there is a true revelation manifestation of the power of the world when they received the pumpkin on their doors changed their life they could not die anymore when i received that amen why right because they obeyed the revelation they received the revelation of the mystery all the others did not know what was going on unless they were without receiving the message of the addict there's only one way to receive the token by accepting the message [Music] [Music] when we can display the token of the holy spirit it shows that we have been accepted in christ and that is i am not reading an obituary holy spirit over when we display it it shows that we have been accepted in christ how do you join the true church of the lord jesus christ join it by being baptized only in water come on now by one word by one oh no people are not sure you you you become a member of that church oh who can remember what can you say by one spirit one token a commander will come one spirit hallelujah amen and that is our talking

decision made why didn't you not breathe make up your mind then you are either going to serve god or mom and dad you take your choice but the decision has to be [Music] we will chase things like that the decision is made son of a quarterback then the engagement comes and the engagement you find it at the altar all that as when you want to be married or to get married we make our things in the light in the corridors excuse is find oh [Music] after that when you you are you are sure she's the one it's wise and good you come to the place and discuss it over here talk it over check them and

down and deliver her already sister agnes is his first child for those of you who don't know sister agnes to my young brother but also my daughter and uh we were with her in ethiopia for several years then later on they came back and got married now come on they were fun but their first child you know they had an issue with the doctors had an issue they said they would not be able to deliver normally [Music] they need an operation and she started labor last night i think the other night yeah nico neville so she went in doing it the hospital hospital ago and they have the doctors when they did the scan they said this the chances are 50 50 for how to deliver normal yoga [Music] and uh so they then finally checked her and they said well she's already in labor but it's been i it is faith and we want to stand with her believing that the lord will give her a number and before we go to pray for her to name it i would like us to pray for here [Music] you say all things are possible completely destroyed in the name of jesus give us salvation and may she deliver normally amen may that be a deliverance maybe may that be a great deliverance for the glory of your holiness to return in the name of jesus christ thank you jesus amen amen amen may the lord bless you so much [Music] before i dismiss you i would like to uh let you know but again that uh we are still at it cheating uh we are still collecting our church land fund [Music] [Music] reason that it is wrong why your name should not be watched in a better way don't fear how much you are giving everybody americans do whatever you do if it is one thousand never seen you call me 2 000. you can send as little as that on the on that number there never seem antonos just where does it be using your mobile money some mobile money and it will go straight to the bank account so but those who have given them about this and those who are planning on giving never take why [Music] [Music] so we want to give an opportunity to get a woman to all those who don't give at the time and those who also give neither are you but they also want to give the little change check out everything and then uh let us use that bug to collect check for me and every service like we agreed on the other side every service will be collecting for the service to being something toward the church amen whatever you give to not your wife to the lord him come you lend to the lord oh oh come on i told someone don't say i don't have nagas now what i as as your passing take your time give them the bag let them pass it slowly by saying unless you don't have but if you have put something forward the nature only never would you come what was i saying that do not say program well i i have only a little i have so little that i can't you lend to the lord oh hold up amen this man is not going to build a pastor his home and senators he's going to build a sanctuary and the moment we get our land take maybe we shall begin to
