[48:30] all israel and beginning from vast age
[48:32] amen
[48:34] and when the philistines heard that
[48:36] david was anointed
[48:37] king over all israel all the philistines
[48:40] went up to sick david
[48:42] and david heard of it and went out
[48:44] against them
[48:46] brother shem and the philistines came
[48:49] and spread themselves in the valley of
[48:51] refine
[48:52] and david inquired of god saying
[48:55] shall i go up against the philistines
[48:59] and without deliver them into my hand
[49:02] and the lord said
[49:03] unto him go up for i will deliver them
[49:06] into the in hand
[49:07] so they came up to bow perism
[49:10] and david smote them there then david
[49:14] said
[49:14] god has broken in upon my enemies by my
[49:18] hand like the breaking forth of waters
[49:22] therefore they call the name of that
[49:24] place
[49:25] baal perezm and when they had left
[49:28] their god there david gave a commandment
[49:32] and they were banned with fire

[50:47] and the philistines yet again spread
[50:49] themselves abroad in the valley
[50:52] i have a philosophy
[50:56] therefore david inquired again of god
[50:58] and god and god said unto him
[51:00] go not up after them turn away from them
[51:04] and come up pawn them over against the
[51:07] mulberry trees
[51:08] and it shall be when thou
[51:11] it shall be when thou shalt uh all right
[51:15] go ahead verse 14.
[51:39] all right verse 15 and it shall be
[51:42] when thou shalt hear a sound of going
[51:46] in the tops of the multavi trees then
[51:49] thou
[51:49] shalt go out of battle for god is gone
[51:53] forth before thee to smite the host of
[51:54] the philistines
[51:57] amen
[52:12] [Music]
[52:16] 16 commanded him
[52:19] and they smote the host of the
[52:21] philistines from gibeon
[52:22] even to gaza and the fame of david went
[52:26] out into all the lands and the lord
[52:27] brought the fear of him
[52:29] upon all
[52:52] now what i'm speaking on this morning

[57:18] [Applause]
[57:27] [Applause]
[57:37] because remember saturn is
[58:07] just the feedback but first we need to
[58:09] know who we are
[58:12] we need to know what we stand for
[58:15] our values somewhere else
[58:20] here's
[58:39] [Applause]
[58:49] we found out that the philistines came
[58:52] went out to seek david
[58:55] but david had a witch
[58:59] hallelujah and went out against them
[59:16] immediately
[59:19] he prepared himself to go
[59:22] ok but look at verse 9
[59:26] and the philistines came and spread
[59:29] themselves in the valley of the fame
[59:31] another philosophy never seen that h1
[59:35] virtually fighting you know they always
[59:36] love
[59:37] fighting in the valleys
[59:40] so they went and spread themselves
[59:43] strategically
[59:45] in the valley of the frame back in an
[59:47] eraser name of a foreign and
[59:50] and david knowing that
[59:53] his enemies are out against him
[59:57] he knew i also have to be strategic
[1:00:03] to be a strategic fighter
[1:00:07] not just to be a fighter but i have to
[1:00:10] be
[1:00:11] strategic
[1:00:14] [Applause]
[1:00:40] how many
[1:00:45] [Applause]
[1:00:52] [Applause]
[1:01:00] because the general is the one that
[1:01:02] struck
[1:01:03] strategizes the art of war
[1:01:36] that's all
[1:01:50] connections to overcome
[1:01:54] angular you don't need to be super
[1:01:56] spiritual
[1:01:58] to overcome something the only thing you
[1:02:01] need
[1:02:02] amen is the commander
[1:02:19] uh your general i need generally
[1:02:22] who is your world captain i know
[1:02:26] you don't just go to fight because you
[1:02:29] you have a spear oh because you have a
[1:02:32] gun
[1:02:41] so we have a lot of soldiers physically
[1:02:44] speaking in our nation and in every
[1:02:45] nation
[1:02:47] [Music]
[1:03:00] they have to apply those guns
[1:03:01] strategically a
[1:03:03] moon was because of some magazines
[1:03:05] hallelujah
[1:03:06] you have to apply their guns
[1:03:07] strategically
[1:03:10] they have to wait for a commander indeed
[1:03:18] [Applause]
[1:03:40] it's not much about who is shooting
[1:04:02] [Music]
[1:04:08] he was the king
[1:04:12] anointed as the king yes
[1:04:15] remember the bible says we are kings and
[1:04:17] priests
[1:04:20] so we too we are anointed
[1:04:24] we are anointed to the name of god and
[1:04:27] inspired by our god
[1:04:31] who is the original lord
[1:04:34] amen amen so the bride of jesus christ
[1:04:37] is anointed i'm glad he is christian
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:44] [Applause]
[1:04:50] we must be anointed by the word of god
[1:04:57] [Applause]
[1:05:02] just like david was anointed to take his
[1:05:06] place
[1:05:20] the devil comes out again i was standing
[1:05:23] at you
[1:05:24] when they heard that david was anointed
[1:05:34] against david
[1:06:15] going through problems
[1:06:28] amen the devil is out against you
[1:06:30] because
[1:07:24] amen do not fear this disease
[1:07:40] if it comes to you but you already who
[1:07:42] said that coffee 19 will not come to
[1:07:44] believers
[1:07:48] it will attack even the believers more
[1:07:50] than the unbelievers
[1:07:53] but god promised don't understand he
[1:07:55] will take those
[1:07:56] sicknesses of the egyptians away from us
[1:08:01] but how can he take it away from you
[1:08:03] when you're not fighting
[1:08:05] you have to be in the battle are you not
[1:08:07] bad i'm going to tell you to be
[1:08:10] [Applause]
[1:08:31] you see some people are preaching the
[1:08:33] gospel
[1:08:36] a kind of gospel that says that uh you
[1:08:39] know
[1:08:40] god loves you so much
[1:08:44] and when you become saved you
[1:08:47] you only prosper there is no problems
[1:08:50] among

[1:09:46] i was
[1:09:54] [Applause]
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:42] david
[1:10:56] he knew as a good fighter yeah
[1:11:01] you don't move until you inquire of your
[1:11:04] commands
[1:11:08] even if you feel your enemies about to
[1:11:10] finish you up
[1:11:24] is
[1:11:40] see why is it that many christians fail
[1:11:42] to live a christian life
[1:11:47] you know because we we think that faith
[1:11:50] means that you
[1:11:50] you just have to work yourself up to do
[1:11:52] something
[1:11:57] you know faith means if i don't have a
[1:11:59] car i must fight and i must do this and
[1:12:01] i must
[1:12:02] ensure that i have a kind in one day
[1:12:20] is inquiring
[1:12:48] brains they the understanding
[1:12:56] hallelujah so we know this if it goes
[1:13:00] to god and inquires of him
[1:13:13] when a problem comes to you and your
[1:13:14] family in your home in your marriage
[1:13:19] [Applause]

[1:13:46] philistines
[1:13:50] and will will you deliver them into my
[1:13:53] hands
[1:13:55] the lord said unto him hallelujah
[1:14:11] but god answered him
[1:14:15] hallelujah amen and the lord said unto
[1:14:17] him
[1:14:19] when you say
[1:14:22] he will say we'll get up when you speak
[1:14:26] he will speak
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:21] you can just feel that you pray again
[1:15:27] so that you can people you you know you
[1:15:29] will be able to say i
[1:15:30] i prayed
[1:15:34] don't do it as a customer
[1:16:00] it is impossible to please god
[1:16:46] upon revelation

[1:17:29] little longer
[1:17:35] maybe you want to go to your enemy with
[1:17:37] all the spears and the machetes and the
[1:17:39] and the guns but god wants you to go

[1:19:56] right
[1:19:58] something because you're so talkative
[1:20:01] do something because somebody else has
[1:20:03] done it
