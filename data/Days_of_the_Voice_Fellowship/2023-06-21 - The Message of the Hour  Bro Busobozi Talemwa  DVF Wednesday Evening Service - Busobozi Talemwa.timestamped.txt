[33:55] Bible is not a new book how many Bible
[33:58] is the Bible is an old book
[34:02] of very many years
[34:05] but you see whenever you take this Bible
[34:07] and you read out of it
[34:10] you see something new
[34:13] but it doesn't mean that the Bible in
[34:15] itself is
[34:18] and I'm going to tell you this there is
[34:21] no truth after the Bible was written um
[34:26] there will be no further truth
[34:33] than the truth that is in the Bible
[34:36] are you hearing me the Bible is
[34:42] a
[34:44] book of
[35:42] and so it is taken to be a holy book
[36:04] [Music]
[36:10] will always have his faith and basis of
[36:14] teaching on the Bible
[36:19] we are not listen we are not going to
[36:21] have further truth or more truth beyond
[36:24] the Bible
[36:27] for this is the absolute
[36:32] yes there is no father there is no more
[36:36] Truth
[36:37] for the Bible is the ultimate and
[36:40] absolute truth
[36:46] God will continue to send prophets
[36:50] in every generation every time he will
[36:55] send prophets he will send preachers he
[36:58] will send men women who will have father
[37:01] revelation
[37:02] of God to their people
[37:05] he's a false teachings and I want to say
[37:09] God loved the world
[37:12] Hallelujah
[37:48] [Music]
[38:45] [Music]
[38:52] to restore the church foreign
[40:24] Apostolic Church
[40:27] foreign
[41:42] the foundation foreign
[41:59] one time someone came to brother Branham
[42:02] and he said
[42:05] the way of senior Ministry
[42:09] you have a deeper understanding
[42:12] of the Bible
[42:15] and also the angel of the Lord has
[42:19] visited
[42:20] and also you have a lot of Revelations
[42:28] and so you have all the qualifications
[42:31] [Music]
[42:43] that you should now write a third
[42:45] Testament
[42:47] again
[42:49] so that we can complement this one but
[42:54] what did
[43:20] [Music]
[43:43] and if I can accomplish just one thing
[43:47] I will be satisfied
[43:50] that one thing is to see established a
[43:53] true spiritual relationship foreign
[44:45] [Music]
[45:15] foreign
[46:15] foreign
[47:31] [Music]
[47:52] not be
[47:55] to take back his people
[47:57] through the foundations of the Bible
[48:00] that's why we quote his message
[48:04] that's why we keep saying that the
[48:06] prophet says
[48:10] because if he's a prophet he cannot say
[48:14] anything against the Bible
[48:18] I mean hallelujah amen he will always
[48:22] say yeah yeah what the Bible says
[48:29] what the other side
[48:32] when Paul came on the scene
[48:34] I never preach something different
[48:38] he preached what Peter prayer Paul was
[48:43] not there
[48:44] when Jesus was on Earth
[48:46] Paul was not a Believer at that time
[48:52] but when Peter
[48:54] Pentacles
[49:04] in the name of Jesus Christ
[49:11] a long long time
[49:14] Jesus Christ yes the same truth
[49:53] and what did he tell them
[50:03] he said
[50:07] John yokana
[50:09] baptized unto repentance
[50:12] introducing Jesus Christ and the Bible
[50:16] says
[50:20] they wanted to know what name is
[50:26] the same spirit that Peter was
[50:31] to shout out said repentance
[50:36] the Bible says
[50:44] in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:59] Same Spirit If any man today um
[51:20] foreign
[51:27] [Applause]
[52:27] of restoration
[52:30] [Applause]
[52:40] is going to come out of all the
[52:43] religions
[53:07] those ones are more about Sweden than
[53:09] the Catholics
[53:14] why because this message
[53:17] the preaching of the Bible
[53:20] and what does the bible tell us
[53:23] some demons there are some things which
[53:28] cannot go away yes
[53:32] so if your new message
[53:45] because they have received so much
[53:47] knowledge of the message
[53:50] they can now not
[53:52] Kathy pray for the sick
[53:56] baby religion
[53:59] let me tell you they have missed it
[54:04] in the teaching of the Bible is in the
[54:07] Bible that our Prophet told us he told
[54:10] us Divine heal yeah
[54:20] foreign I had my I have my daughter here
[54:27] she she come on
[54:30] come run quickly
[54:33] or without shoes just come around here
[54:35] where is she I can't see oh she's
[54:36] sleeping okay
[54:43] for animals
[54:46] [Music]
[54:47] and her sister
[54:50] Elizabeth
[54:52] they love dogs
[54:55] and so they wanted a dog
[54:59] and so they got a dog
[55:03] that dog you see a German shepherd
[55:06] friendly dog
[55:10] um
[55:15] but we prayed for her
[55:18] she now plays with the dog
[56:19] set you free
[57:20] they shall speak
[58:19] in the chat
[58:21] foreign
[58:46] amen
[58:47] but what do we have something else
[58:51] something else that is not what we see
[58:54] in the scriptures
[58:59] a man or anything with two heads
[59:03] he doesn't know how to go
[59:06] God never did have two heads of to his
[59:09] church
[59:14] he always dealt in every generation as
[59:17] we've studied through the scriptures
[59:21] there is always
[59:27] because you get two men
[59:30] you got two opinions
[59:33] and it's got to come to one final
[59:36] absolute
[59:38] and our Prophet says
[59:42] is the word is the Bible the Bible
[59:47] Crystal
[1:00:26] foreign
[1:01:12] foreign
[1:01:54] foreign
[1:02:02] praise the name of the Lord I said
[1:02:04] praise the name of the Lord
[1:02:06] that's the prophet I want to believe
[1:02:09] not a prophet who claims
[1:02:12] that his words
[1:02:20] are checked by the Bible because
[1:02:24] in other words he's taking you back
[1:02:30] I am not a Vindicated Prophet over
[1:02:34] generation and sometimes they find
[1:02:36] people who claim to take a scripture and
[1:02:42] take the the quotes
[1:02:48] because the Bible says this year
[1:03:01] was not giving his
[1:03:34] you find people who say women should not
[1:03:38] play their hair
[1:03:41] in the Bible
[1:03:43] and when you stood up but here's what
[1:03:45] I'm saying
[1:03:47] on the matter
[1:03:50] and he gave Divine interpretation to
[1:03:52] that scripture
[1:03:55] we are talking what the Bible says if
[1:03:58] you're taking the what the Bible says
[1:03:59] without Revelation
[1:04:02] the Bible said
[1:04:05] to all of us believe
[1:04:08] let him be baptized
[1:04:15] somebody who is baptizing people like
[1:04:16] that
[1:04:18] things what the Bible says
[1:04:22] here comes
[1:04:26] yes it is
[1:04:35] the name of the Father
[1:04:37] the same name of the sun
[1:04:42] it is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:46] he just gave you divine interpretation
[1:04:49] not his opinions I'm not following an
[1:04:53] opinion demand
[1:04:58] I'm following a man that is
[1:05:06] the Revelation
[1:05:10] I find them you know restricting sisters
[1:05:21] [Applause]
[1:05:31] and that's exactly what the Bible says
[1:05:42] and even when it comes to men
[1:05:56] foreign foreign
[1:06:01] [Applause]
[1:07:54] it's going to be a problem for them
