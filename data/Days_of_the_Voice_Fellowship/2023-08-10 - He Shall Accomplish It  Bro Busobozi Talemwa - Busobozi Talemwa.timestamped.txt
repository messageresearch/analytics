[0:00] so uh we are looking at verses three to
[0:02] six between the summer boxes I thank my
[0:05] God upon every remembrance of you
[0:08] always in
[0:10] in every prayer of mine for you or
[0:13] making requests with joy
[0:16] Neighbors
[0:27] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[0:31] the first day until now
[0:36] um
[0:47] being confident of this very thing that
[0:51] he which has begun a good work in you
[0:54] will perform it until the day of Jesus
[0:56] Christ
[0:59] you know
[1:00] [Music]
[1:03] um
[1:11] so I'm speaking to you tonight when I
[1:14] thought he shall accomplish it
[1:17] foreign
[1:23] on verses 6 in the Amplified he says
[1:27] convinced and confident of this very
[1:30] thing
[1:30] [Music]
[1:44] [Music]
[1:52] okay
[1:54] he says I'm convinced and confident of
[1:56] this very thing
[1:59] but he who has begun a good work in you
[2:04] will continue to perfect
[2:09] and complete it
[2:12] will continue to perfect and complete it
[2:16] is a
[2:18] h
[2:20] yeah that's a big trick in luganda
[2:22] Perfection you will continue to perfect
[2:24] and complete it
[2:27] is
[2:29] yes until the day of Jesus Christ
[2:35] the time of his return
[2:39] so I'm talking about he
[2:42] shall accomplish it
[2:45] is
[2:48] that whatever God begins
[2:54] finish it it does not leave it in the
[2:57] middle
[2:58] go through with it again
[3:03] but many times we as human beings can
[3:07] begin our work
[3:08] and because of one reason or the other
[3:12] questions we may not be able to
[3:15] accomplish
[3:16] so because of unforeseeable uh facts
[3:20] [Applause]
[3:22] you may start to build a house
[3:25] when you have a good salary
[3:28] when everything is going well
[3:31] and then you reach the middle somewhere
[3:34] and you realize you no longer have a job
[3:40] you cannot continue
[3:43] [Applause]
[4:07] and so is life
[4:10] many things in our life
[4:13] we don't get to complete many things
[4:18] you wake up one morning and say today
[4:20] I'm going to do
[4:22] ABCDEFG Channel
[4:26] and then by evening you realize you have
[4:29] only accomplished the two okay
[5:01] [Applause]
[5:27] maybe you put something for two years or
[5:29] three years or four years or five years
[5:32] [Applause]
[5:33] and they've been pushing it ahead ever
[5:36] since
[5:38] foreign
[6:14] foreign
[6:21] some of you are very powerful and very
[6:23] energetic and evangelism
[6:30] [Applause]
[6:33] somewhere you feel you begin to feel
[6:35] cold
[6:37] no longer want to do what you want doing
[6:40] before
[6:43] you know it is in every area of our life
[6:48] that we as human beings it is within us
[6:53] to give up
[6:54] it is within us to failure many times
[6:58] you've not come to church not because
[7:00] you could have or you were not it was
[7:02] not impossible for you to come and be
[7:04] said everything
[7:06] because of one thing you say well I'll
[7:08] go tomorrow
[7:10] maybe you wanted to go and take the
[7:13] message to someone and then you say well
[7:15] maybe I'll
[7:23] some brothers they said why do you push
[7:26] to tomorrow what you can do today
[7:33] it is always good to wait upon the Lord
[7:37] if you're praying and waiting upon the
[7:39] Lord for something
[7:41] that is all right but I believe for
[7:45] things that you are sure
[7:48] this is the mind of God
[7:51] the will of God the word of God I don't
[7:56] believe to pushing it for tomorrow
[7:59] when you can do it today
[8:03] is always the best
[8:05] [Applause]
[8:07] but now in us we fail many times
[8:11] we will accomplish our desires
[8:15] and we have been failures
[8:19] how many have not been failures
[8:22] have always accomplished everything they
[8:25] wanted everybody
[8:28] raise up your hands no one he has raised
[8:32] up their hands
[8:33] because you have accomplished a few
[8:35] command and many you found that you felt
[8:39] shot
[8:41] and even now you're beginning maybe to
[8:44] regret
[8:45] I wish I had done that
[8:49] I would have been here
[8:54] and that is the way of man we regret
[8:57] yourself when we failure we don't
[9:00] accomplish and we feel bad about it
[9:05] but I'll tell you why because as human
[9:09] beings we don't know tomorrow
[9:11] as human beings
[9:14] we see in a
[9:38] [Applause]
[10:13] in our image
[10:36] the devil
[11:09] [Applause]
[11:13] because God faulted
[11:52] don't think that when
[11:55] when the devil came in the garden
[11:58] and they lured the woman
[12:02] that God was shocked
[12:08] tell me am I saying cleared
[12:13] is that the devil doing that
[12:17] Michael what should we do no that's not
[12:20] good
[12:22] that's not our God
[12:24] our God saw it before it happens
[12:31] I said when it happened
[12:33] all the angels we are shocked
[12:38] was not moved
[12:41] because he knew what would happen
[12:44] and because they knew what would happen
[12:47] is
[14:16] foreign
[15:16] foreign hey
[15:26] he says my thoughts
[15:54] what are you thinking about yourself
[15:58] that's not what God is thinking
[16:01] [Laughter]
[16:03] hallelujah amen so I'm like this foreign
[16:45] oh praise the name of the Lord I
[16:55] [Music]
[16:56] value themselves
[16:58] depending on the value people put on
[17:01] them
[17:04] if people think you were a fool our
[17:07] children you begin to feel so bad
[17:11] and they begin to feel like we're a fool
[17:17] if people think of you as a bad person
[17:22] you start to feel that you're bad
[17:25] and that's why we always defend
[17:27] ourselves
[17:29] when someone imagine if you're walking
[17:31] on the road
[17:33] and someone says
[17:36] sister brother be sincere
[17:47] how can you say that I am not a
[17:51] fooling yourself
[18:01] but that is his thoughts
[18:05] it's not the thoughts of God
[18:08] you understand amen don't think of
[18:11] yourself
[18:16] the value people put on you foreignty
[18:37] that their thoughts are not God's souls
[18:39] and those are Services
[18:42] the thoughts of God are very different
[18:45] from you
[18:49] neither are you always my ways
[18:52] for as the heavens are higher than the
[18:55] Earth
[19:03] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[19:08] what are your thoughts about your life
[19:12] what are your thoughts about your
[19:14] success
[19:16] what about your success who are not your
[19:20] Victory but your success
[19:23] somebody throw the word to him if you
[19:25] get it if you don't get it just say it
[19:27] in English let us move on your thoughts
[19:29] are about your success
[19:31] you your thoughts about your children
[19:34] you see when we talk about success we're
[19:37] talking about success we are talking
[19:39] about you know moving from one level to
[19:42] another Texas
[19:45] but spiritually and physically
[19:51] according to the world
[19:52] if you're not highly educated remember
[19:55] there was someone new you don't have a
[19:57] very good paying job
[19:58] students
[20:02] you are not successful
[20:07] that's not the thoughts of God
[20:11] so the thoughts now because people think
[20:14] like that
[20:15] so you begin to think the way they think
[20:19] and you attribute your success to what
[20:23] people think success is
[20:31] always yearning for what people think
[20:46] they decided to
[20:49] um they decided to think they decided to
[20:51] say well their success was on was on the
[20:55] best of how many people they had how how

[21:32] 000.1 and they said oh we have been
[21:34] successful
