They shall be filled." Lord, we have come tonight desiring that we might be filled, filled with your spirit, filled with your word, with your presence, and that you let all our problems fade away. That's our desire, Lord. Grant it tonight, as we go into your word, open your word of life. That's our desire. &gt;&gt; Maybe if only the pianist can play just a moment, I'd like us to sing this song together. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus draw me closeer [Music] to you, Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let the world around me &gt;&gt; fade away. Tell him now Jesus draw me close [Music] along to thee. [Music] Let the world around me fade away. Is it your prayer tonight? &gt;&gt; Would you just sing those words with me now? Jesus draw me close to you. [Music] Let thy world around me f away. [Music] Hallelujah. For I desire to wash it and oy hallelujah. Amen. Shall we please go to our Bibles tonight? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are reading in the book of Luke chapter 16. verses one tonight. We read this on Sunday &gt;&gt; and so I do not expect to take along. Nice to see you, brother. God bless you. But for the sake of those who are not with us on Sunday, let's just read it again. And he said also unto his disciples, we just take it verse by verse. Unto his disciples, there was a certain rich man which had a steward, and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. [Music] And he called him and said unto him, "How is it that I hear this of thee? Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer a steward. Then the steward said with within himself, "What shall I do? For my lord taketh away from me the stewardship I cannot dig to beg. I am ashamed. [Music] I am resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship they may receive me into their houses. Now, now remember that the ones that he wants the the ones that he is desiring that will receive him are the people that were being he was being he was serving the dattors of his master. So he called everyone, this is verse five, of his glorious datas unto him, and said unto the first, "How much ost thou unto my lord?" And he said, "An 100 measures of oil." And he said unto him, "Take thy bill and sit down quickly and write 50. Then said he to another, "And how much to another, and how much, oh thou?" And he said, "Anunded measures of wheat." And he said unto him, "Take thy bill and write for for score. [Music] And and the Lord commended the unjust steward because he had done wisely. For the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light. [Music] And I say unto you, make to yourselves friends of the m of unrighteousness, that when ye fail, they may receive you into everlasting habitation. Now tonight I want us to take maybe three more verses. He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much. And he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. Can we say amen to that? If therefore ye cannot be cannot if ye therefore um excuse me if therefore ye have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who will commit to you trust the true riches. Praise God. And if ye have not been faithful in that which is another man is, who shall give you that which is your own? 13. &gt;&gt; No servant can serve two monsters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will hold to the one and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mmon. Amen. You may be seated. This is a a very good um a a very good exhortation from the Lord. [Music] And um I'd like you where you are seated to really be attentive and listen and you know whenever you are hearing the word you should always try to personalize it to yourself. Own it. So don't say they preaching to somebody else or to someone who did not come or to someone who is streaming. The Lord is speaking to me. How many came to hear from the Lord? Amen. And so I I also came to hear from the Lord. I believe that he would speak to each of us. Praise God. It's always wonderful to see those who make it on Wednesday. And sometimes there's more, sometimes there's less. But it's always a honor if you can be able to squeeze in time and be in church. Amen. &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, you realize that you have been a good steward because you see you've been given time. How are you using your time? Are you using it to serve the Lord? You cannot serve two masters. They used to read this scripture back in the in the days in the Anglican church. But what the reason why I appreciate the message of the hour is it goes way deeper into these things, these scriptures and opens a lot more for us. And so you cannot serve God and M. You are here in this dimension to serve the Lord. You are here to live for the Lord. Whatever you have Whatever you you he allows you to possess in your hand is not for you to own. It is for his glory. And um remember our title is a sacred trust and we found that the meaning of a word of the word sacred trust or a trust rather is a trust is a legal arrangement where a person or entity that who is the trustee holds assets for the benefit of another person. Uh, you know, I I remember when we were still young, you know, you would take your bread and maybe you give it to your elder brother and you tell them, "Keep for me." But you know sometimes you you come back and you find that they have eaten a piece of it and then you you will begin crying out loud and you will say now I don't want it. Now I don't even want it again. I I want you to to buy me a new one. Why? Because they were not a good trustee. And that's how many Christians are that God has given to us something. And we found, we went through a lot of them on Sunday and found that each of us has something that God has entrusted us with. We are trustees. We are holding certain assets. in each of us. There are certain assets. Sometimes there are natural gifts embedded in you [Music] that you can do certain things different from anybody else. It means you are people call it in the world talented. You find that someone maybe is talented to uh to do works of art. Maybe someone is talented to sing or maybe another is talented to you know do something that in in a in a very extraordinary way [Music] and and so those are abilities given to us by God. All of us we have it. You have yours. I have mine. Each of us is born special. Praise God. But you know, we were not given those things so that we might be able to own them. Sometimes it may not be a talent or a gift. Sometimes it might be certain breakthroughs in life. Maybe a good job. Maybe a good car, maybe a bicycle or maybe a motorcycle or maybe a house or maybe you know um a good business and you have um a very good income and you know those things are not really yours. If you thought it was yours, you were mistaken. It was given to you as a sacred trust from God. You know, a sac trust is not just something given to you to own. It is something uh entrusted for to you for divine purpose. divine purpose. You know now I know we read that scripture many times which says for all things work together for good to them that love the Lord. And he doesn't stop there. He says to them that are called according to his purpose. So there is a purpose of God in each of our life. And if you've not found your purpose in life, you have not started living. Until you find your life's purpose, then you have started to live because you will be remembered for the purpose God placed you here for you know you can do a lot of things but when they are completely out of your purpose or rather should I say God's purpose for your life. That's why it is always important for us as believers to know the perfect will of God for our life in important matters. In every important matter. And how do you know? Through prayer. Through communication. You have to talk to the Lord. But how many of us pray? How many of us spend some time with the Lord in prayer? You find that the less you pray, the more problems you're going to have in your life because you'll be confused. You know the word, but you're living out of purpose. But when you when you live a life of prayer, you know, each time you consult with God, you know, you are is helping you to live according to your life's purpose. I don't know about you, but I desire I have this desire that I I be found each time in God's purpose for my life. You know, when you know you are doing God's purpose for your life, you don't fear anything. Hallelujah. Whatever you do, you don't fear no man. You don't fear what they will say. You know many times people fear what will they say? If I know I am walking in God's purpose for me, I don't fear what they will say because I am not here to do according to what they will say. But I'm here to live according to what he will think about me. After I'm done with this life, I want to walk into the other dimension. And I want to hear him say, "Well done, thou good and faithful servant." I want to be a good steward. But how can you be a good steward? If you don't even know what has been entrusted you with, you don't know what you have. And that's why Jesus said the children of this world in their generation they are wiser than the children of light. They know what they are entrusted with. They know how to utilize it and how to use it so that it will prepare for their future. Brethren, let us wake up. Let us begin planning and preparing for our future. And the future I'm talking about is not of this world because our Lord said, "My kingdom is not of this world." Amen. And you know all the old saints, we are looking for for for that kingdom, for that city whose builder and maker is God. And it is not of this world is in another dimension. Rather, I believe we are being prepared to walk into another dimension. That is the purpose of the word. The purpose of the word is to prepare you to make you ready. And here this man, praise God, he was a bad steward, he was a bad steward because &gt;&gt; or we can call him the an unjust steward because the master gave him, you know, this job. But according to uh the reporters that he had wasted his the master's goods. [Music] And when he learned that he was going to be uh fired, he quickly now began to think about his future. [Music] He started thinking about his future. How shall I live? He said, I cannot dig. I don't know how to dig. I I I I am I'm ashamed to beg. &gt;&gt; Where will I have a living? So now he said I am resolved what I'm going to do. He quickly began calling one by one. And you know the first one he called. He was owing um something like uh 100 measures of oil and he said okay as for you quickly get a pen write 50 that's what you will pay. So he forgave him 50 and the second one it was 100 he told him now write 80 quickly quickly. So he forgave him 20 and he went on and on and on and I want you to imagine if how many were the debtors were there. We don't want to have an idea but he must have forgave them a lot of money and he was planning his life after being fired said because he knew that if I forgive these people some money I have made them my friends when I am fired from them they will receive me in their home because I I I they know how much I forgave them when I was still in the position of authority when I could tell them write this man write this man and you know the way he was doing it do it quickly quickly quickly quickly before he's fired because he knew what was coming but he wanted to secure his future and he did it so well so cunningly and Jesus commanded him Amen. He commanded that unjust steward. He say he said he had done wisely. And what's the wisdom that he used? He was able to use the resources that he had been entrusted with though unjustly. But he he he used it wisely. to secure his future. Brother, that is a wise man. I'm sure after he was fired, he did not beg and also he did not dig. But he was being helped by these people. He would go from one to one. You remember how much you were owed but you remember you remember what I did for you. You know you was like the politicians these days. Praise God. And now Jesus is telling us we should also make ourselves friends of the m of unrighteousness that when we fail they will they shall receive that we may they may receive us in into everlasting habitation. Now friends and that we can talk about it in many different directions but I wanted to talk about that and say it's not only money it's the resources that we are given while we are on earth we should use them wisely. Whatever you have, if you use it wisely, it will help you to receive eternal life. Amen. &gt;&gt; We find people in the Bible who just, you know, helped others to have some clothing. We find others who just visited, you know, those who were in in prison. Maybe they gave a cup of water or or drink or food or something and they were able to get eternal life like that just like that. They used what the substance that they have and when they failed they were received into eternal life. Now friends, we also have resources. We have assets that God has entrusted us with. Amen. And if we use it wisely, if we are faithful with there, we will never fail. The Bible says that he that is faithful in little is also faithful in much. But he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much. What makes you think that God will increase your level? He will bless you if you are not faithful in the little that you have. [Music] What you have today? I have a question for you. This is real. How are you serving God? Please don't only put money in your mind. put money and much more. How are you serving the Lord with your time? With your money, with your mouth, with your body, with your ears, with your eyes, with your children, with your wife and husband and family and friends that you have. the the church family and whatever God has allowed you to have that you have in your hand, how have you utilized it? Have you been faithful in that? Because if you're faithful in that, I can almost tell you prepare for promotion. Do not look for promotion if you're not faithful in what you have. But if you're faithful in what you have, it is a must for you to be promoted. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our Lord is a faithful master. He can never make you serve him for nothing. [Music] He can never fail you or forsake you. That's why if you are faithful in the little that you have, he will promote you. He will promote you. You know what did he tell the disciples? They came to him and he said, "What about us who are forsaken mothers, fathers and houses and the things and what whatever more? What shall we get?" You know, he said you'll get 100fold here and over there. He even said they'll get houses and lands. So whatever whatever you do to serve the Lord, there is a promotion. That's one thing I love about the Lord. Amen. He always promotes you on on the basis of merit. You can never bribe him. Some people want to bribe God with their prayers. Yet you are not faithful, but you are trying to bribe him with prayers. Let me tell you, pray after doing the right thing. There are principles of of the word in every matter in marriage, in family, in in finances, in you know jobs and work and everything. There are principles. Seek to know those principles. Be faithful at them. Amen. And then pray. But if you are not faithful and you're very busy praying, expect no promotion. You find in the book of Acts. There was a man called Cornelius. Praise God. Cornelius was a good man. The Bible says he he loved to do alms. He always wanted to help others. He had a heart of helping others. And are you following me? Are you following me? He always loved to help others. And so and also he was a soldier. But also the Bible says he he he loved prayer. So they so he did not only pray, he always helped and he gathered people and his house and everybody did whatever he could do. And he had a desire for the truth, but he did not know how to get, but he only did what he could do. You don't know how you will get what you want, but what you want, the ability to get it is already deposed in you. Just be faithful. Be faithful with the principles of the word and then God will also be faithful. Amen. To to be able to promote you. And then this man, you know, as as he was praying, he he did not know any person who was Christian. But somehow God who was rich in mercy, he sent an angel. He sent an angel. God will always send angels. Amen. We know we have we have angels with wings and angels without wings. And this evening, right now, You are listening to an angel without wings. God has sent you an angel tonight. If you have ears to hear, what he says, let him that has ears to hear, let him hear what the spirit say unto the church. Amen. And he sent an angel and he told him, "Amen, go and call Peter somewhere." I think it was some other place. and and um this man sent an um a company you know people to go and pick up Peter. We know that the Lord had also spoken to Peter. You know you know the vision that he got of the sheet and with all the animals and he told him kill and eat. He said no Lord I can listen listen follow me I cannot eat that which is unclean. You know what? This man Cornelius was a Roman, meaning he was a gentile. But you see, people like Peter did not believe in preaching the gospel to the Gentiles. They only thought that the gospel was for the Jews because, you know, he was a Jew. And so he refused. Of course, the gospel was not for the Gentiles. It was for the Jews. But also, you know, according to the Jewish rules, the laws, there were animals they were not supposed to eat. Of course, even the Old Testament. And the Jews believed in the Old Testament. And so they were not supposed to eat the unclean animals. And they were supposed to eat the ones which were clean. But in that also it also meant that the the Gentiles were unclean before God and they had not been accepted by God. Because remember when he came, he came into the house of Israel. Are you following me? But by grace. Amen. According to Romans chapter 11, the Gentiles were grafted in You know, we were the wild. The Bible says we were the wild branch. But you see, by grace, he cut us from the wild and he grafted us onto the olive tree. So now we are receiving the life of the olive tree. The olive tree which is Christ. We are now receiving the life of it. And the Jews were cut off because of unbelief. So right now it is the dispensation of the Gentiles and the Gentiles cannot be cut off until the fullness comes and the fullness of the Gentiles listen is coming in at the end of the seven church ages. Revelation 1, 2, and 3 speaks of the seven church ages from from the first one, Ephesian. [Applause] And you know, in every age, there is a bride. There is a message with a message to call out the bride. In Ephesus, there was a message with a message. His name was Paul. and he was the very first one. All the other messengers must have the same message like the first one and you know all through the seven churches. You know God kept on sending his word and sending his word and sending his word and why there were people there to receive that word. Are you following me? And we have arrived at the very last age. This is the last age by the way. Can you imagine that brother? This is the last generation. There is no more time. There is no more ages. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 after seven eight. Number seven in the counting of God is a number of completion. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Number eight is a number of eternity. Praise God. Even in mathematics they write it like that. Eight. What's that? Is it called better? Infinity. &gt;&gt; Oh yes, I think that's right. I'm not really sure, but I think that's it. Yeah, but it's the number of eternity. Eight. Go and find out. So now when you count from 1 to seven is completion. And then when you go when you continue, you now enter into eternity. A new beginning. You continue a new beginning. A new beginning. Now listen. After the seventh church age, the then comes the rapture. When we walk into that dimension, there is no growing old anymore. We will be younger forever. We will no more get sick. We will have overcome the world completely. But only the good stewards will enter in there. Praise God. And so this man, Apostle Rather Peter, when he heard the voice, the voice spoke to him and said, "Kill and eat." He said, "I can't eat that which is unholy." That is true. &gt;&gt; It was unholy. But something happened. Amen. The blood was shed. The savior died. You remember revelation 5? Amen. When the voice said, "Who is worthy?" And there was no one worthy. And John wept. But then he had a voice weep not John. The lion of the tribe of Judah has prevailed. Protect the boot. and to lose the seven thereof. Amen. And who is that one? He turned to see. And when he turned to see, he saw a lamb which was slain before the foundation of the world. A lamb slain before the foundation of the world. Yes, the Gentiles were unclean. But in the mind of God, there was never a time when they were unclean. All those that had the DNA of God, the identity of God in them, they have never been unclean. They have never been sinners. They have never been an forsaken. Do you know that's what you wear in the mind of God? Do you know you have actually never been a sinner? Do you know you have always been perfect? in the mind of God. And why are you here? You are here to be manifested. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To be manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. As a child of God, a son of God. But you see, what does he do to prove who you are? He gives you a trust. Amen. He gives you a trust and he says, "Keep it. Use it well. Prove the devil who you are. Prove the devil. You are a good trust. Hallelujah. Amen. There are others who are unjust. But we are just stewards because what we have been entrusted with he cannot trust us. If he did not know us, he knew us before the foundation of the world and he cannot give us this sacriice, not knowing we shall overcome or knowing that we fail. Listen, he cannot save you to lose you. He saved you knowing he can never. Even when you fail him, he can never fail you. Why? Because you have always been a gene of God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is this sac trust? He has given us the sac trust of his word. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know in the beginning he gave it to Adam. Adam this sacred trust and he told him this is the word keep it the day you eat there you shall die the day the day you disobey me you will die the day you a bad steward you will die take this word keep it do what I said never eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but Adam you know he lost it &gt;&gt; you know he lost that title did. But I'm so glad the title did. Amen. Has been taken because there has been one that is worth it to take it to lose it and open the mystery. Hallelujah. Do you know the mystery has opened? Do you know the mystery of the book? I'm asking you a question. Do you know the mystery of that book? The mystery of that book. I have always pointed you to Colossians 1. is that even the mystery which was hid from generation but now it has been revealed has been made manifest which is what is Christ in you Christ in you hope of glory without Christ being in you there is no hope of glory The Bible says all have sinned and have come short of the glory. Through Adam, we all died. Through Adam, we all sinned. Through Adam, we all fell. Through Adam, we all lost the glory. But thank God for a second. Thank God for the oil. Hallelujah. Amen. Listen, all the church agents, all the church agents, they have been taking a portion of that book. Passion, portion, portion, portion, portion. But listen, the full mystery of that book would not be revealed. It it would not be revealed until the last day until the end time. Hallelujah. Are you following me? Until the last day bride is until the seventh age has come. Revelation 10:7. That's why we are called days of the voice of the voice because it says in the day of the voice of the seven. Hallelujah. You know, Revelation 10:1, you know, the mighty angel descends down with an open book. Amen. And uh the Bible says as he began to sound, as he began to speak, seven thunders uttered their voice. And when seven thunders uttered their voice, John was about to write. But the voice told him, "No, no, no, John, do not write down. Leave this stuff. Leave it sealed." You remember even Daniel It was the same thing said it's not for it's not the time no mighty prophet no all with all those great prophets were able to know the mystery but that mystery would be revealed in the last days but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. Not the first angel, not the second angel, not the third angel, not the fourth angel. Where's my picture, my brother? Not the fifth angel. Not the sixth angel. But he said in the day of the what? Of the what? Come on now. Of the what? Of the voice. He did not say the days of the seventh angel. He did not say in the days of the seventh angel. No, he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to serve. Hallelujah. The mystery of God should be finished. Hallelujah. When brother Bam was baptizing in Ohio River 1933, the voice spoke out of fire came and a voice came out and spoke these words as John the Baptist was sent to for my first coming. Your message will for my second coming. your what message. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Not you. Your message. And God gave him an instruction. Record all these messages you're preaching. It will be food for my bride in the end time. What is it? is a voice of the seventh angel in the days of the voice of the seventh angel. when he begins to sound that's why we listen to those text that's why we read those books let me tell you if you are not you have to begin because the more you listen to it the more you realize who you are the more you see your name the more you you begin overcoming hallelujah amen the bride loves the world the bride is the word. The bride enjoys the word. That's who we are. Hallelujah. Amen. When it begins to sound, the mystery of God is finished. Hallelujah. So I said the mystery is finished. I say it is finished. No more revelation. It's all here. What is it? &gt;&gt; Christ in you. What is the mystery? The mystery is not coming. The mystery is here. The mystery is Christ in you. The hope of glory. What do you say pastor? Even the others say that's true. No, &gt;&gt; there's a big difference. They think when they speak in tongues and when the anointing comes on them they fall. They think that that's the Holy Spirit. But that's why they missed it. They think it's the Holy Ghost. Yes, it is the Holy Ghost. The anointing of the Holy Ghost on their on their spirit. Are you following me? But you can have all the anointing you want but remain a seed. Remain an unjust source. When you have the anointing, you can preach, you can do miracles, signs and wonders and all the things, but you still believe in women preaching. You still paint yourself like Jezebel. And yet you have all the anointing. You you can you can have the anointing and still dress skimpy clothes. We see it. It's the truth. Still marry more than one woman. And you say it doesn't matter what I do. It is what is in me. No, what you are doing is because of what is in you. So it is true what you do doesn't matter. But what you do is not done by you. That's why it doesn't matter. It is done by what is in you. Jesus said what enters into a man doesn't defile him. But what comes out of you that defiles him. So what a person does, how you speak, how you relate with others, how you dress, how you you which songs you listen to, the appetite you have. It shows what is in you. It is either Christ or Satan. [Music] It's either the world or the Lord. And let me tell you my brother and my sister. Amen. It's only the word which can regenerate you. Amen. And Christ is the word. Christ cannot go against his own word. You cannot receive the true genuine Holy Ghost and you refuse water baptism in the name of Jesus. It shows what is in you is not the word. And so my friend, that's the difference. Christ in you will always agree with the word. Show me a people. Show me a people that believe the word. The whole world with a life following with a life following. And I will show you the bride. Hallelujah. Amen. A bride that is in the image. that was lost but now restored. Do you know we are walking in a new image? The image which Adam lost because whatever Adam lost has been restored back again to us. We are not a normal people. We are supernatural. We are walking in in the image of the first man before the fall. Amen. Before Genesis uh you know two, we are walking in Genesis 1. We are walking in Genesis 1 which is a man when God said let there be a man in my own image in our own image. And the Bible says so God created man in his own image in his own image. Created he him male and female. Listen church. That man was not a fleshy man. That man was a spirit man. That man, his will was aligned with the will of the father. That man, Amen, could never break the word. That man could keep, amen, the trust that was given to him. We are not just restored to Genesis 2 because in Genesis 2 we can fall again. The man who lost it was Genesis 2 and he lost the sacred trust. But the man of Genesis 1 cannot cannot. Why? because he's in a perfect image of God. Hallelujah. He's aligned. His will is aligned with the will of God. Let me tell you, brother, you may not feel it right now. Because you are in this flesh, but we are not feeding the flesh. The word we have received. The revealed word, the spoken word is feed in the soul. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that soul &gt;&gt; has been restored &gt;&gt; back again into the original image. And soon you're doubting that you just wait soon and very soon we shall drop this place and we will walk into our Why are we so happy now? Because this word unites us with our theophony. Each of us has a theopha. And when we hear the word, we are hearing a portion of the other body. We are getting connected. We are getting connected. Amen. Amen. And the Bible says, "If that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead, who are in you, he shall quicken your mortal body." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Soon and very soon, our bodies are going to be quickened. Right now, they can be quickened until we speak a new language and we speak in tongues. Amen. It can be quickened and we prophesy and we interpret. But there is a higher picking, a real one which will make us drop these robes of flesh and we put on immortality. I am waiting for that moment. It might as well be the next minute. Rather, let us feed on the water and enjoy. Because the more we receive, Amen, we are changing, changing, changing, changing. This word is our sacred trust. Hallelujah. Adam was given this sac trust. Adam lost it. But I tell you brother, after the opening of the seat, we cannot lose this sacrifice. Hallelujah. We cannot fall. But the Bible says she cannot fall. The first Eve fell. But this Eve cannot fall. Why? Because we have been restored. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see, she has been given this secret trust that she cannot must not break and brother Bam then begins to talk about a woman and you know we are spiritually we are the woman and and he says she has been given a a circuit trust of womanhood. um to act her character to raise her children to be honorable to her husband. What a secret trust. What a responsibility to a woman. Now she she see why she's a type of the church which is the same responsibility as a woman has a sacred responsibility to her motherhood. to have virtues to her husband. The church has a sacred responsibility, to prayer, to the word, and to Christ. Just the same as the woman has. I want to make three things here that she must not get away from. Now, I'm speaking. can keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this to the natural woman. She has a secret trust of virtue committed to her by her lord, [Music] a certain virtue. Nothing else holds it but a woman. It's committed to her by God. She must not defile that virtue. If she even does something wrong, she must confess that to her husband before she he takes her and make it right. The same as the church that was married to the law, it has to come also before Christ before the second marriage. She has to confess that if she doesn't and she lives with her husband for 10 years and then confess it, he has a right to put her away and marry another woman. If a woman is not yet married and she goes and do bad things, she doesn't tell the husband who's after 10 years later and tells him they forgive me. I lied to you because I was fearing. I thought you will leave me but I was not. I lied. I had even done abortion. I had even done this and that brother even if it is 10 years the man can chase that woman and marry another one. Now why? Because it's only a woman that has been given that virtue. She can say no or yes. If she doesn't and she lives with husband for 10 years and confess it, he has a right to marry another woman. That's the scripture. Fornication is living. She had a sacred trust of the virtue that's been given her trusted to her by the Lord. God gave her that virtue just as it was in the garden of Eden. She can say yes or no. You know when she got this baby, she said, "I've gotten a man from the Lord." But she knew where the child came from, from the serpent. She mad has a virtue. The Bible says, "So, so is the way of an adulterous woman. She eatth and wipeth her mouth and says, "I've done no evil." But we know the evil was adultery. [Music] She has a circle trust of womanh who committed to her that she must not break. The woman I'm speaking of here is her conduct. [Music] her character around men. Amen. Looks you know look look on these screens and see these movie stars kissing and hugging and slopping and around over these women. A woman does that is of a bad character. She might be virtuous otherwise but see in her heart when those sex glands and in the lips the man kisses a woman's actually potentially committed adultery. [Music] Sex glands are in the in in a woman's lips and in a man's lips. He could kiss her on the hand. It would be it wouldn't mix with that sex grants. But the sex grants is in the lips and see all this nonsense and the Hollywood today of all this flopping and laughing around with women and so forth and little girls looking at all that. No wonder our morals are rotten and decayed and filthy because it is put before the children. It has to be that way for the last day. Now keep the church in mind. The church is kissing and slopping and mixing around in everything else but the word. Look at the way they dress. Hear the songs they sing. But they call themselves the church of Christ. mixing and slapping with the world but not the word. You see they led the devil and education and scientific searches and so forth. She has this secret womanhood. No wonder that men act around women the way they do. Is because women act around men the way they do. She characters herself out here with a pair of shorts on and skirt tight and men's clothes and things out on the street twisting around no matter what she says. She might be as virtuous to her husband as she can be, but in the sight of God, she is an adulteress. Whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already and she presented herself to be that and that's exactly what the church has done with the world that's committed to her three things virtue s womanhood and then s motherhood to honor her husband. But the women of these days don't have those virtues. They have lost those sacred virtues. Just like the church has lost those, the church of England has voted a woman to be the archbishop of Canterbury. Even the Catholic church knows better. They know better. That's why you see the Pentecostals, they do things which even the Catholic church cannot do. [Music] The Pentecostal pastors and churches are doing things that even the Anglicans are suppressed. And the anglicans are doing things that even the Catholics say why the more revelation but without the life the worse they become. That's why I'm not surprised if they can even be in the message believe the message and and and and be worse than even the Pentecost. Let me tell you church, the message we believe is a real message. Is a true message is a true word. But let me tell you the truth. If you It doesn't change you to be the best. You will become the worst. So choose. Which direction will you take? As for me, I want to be the best. I want to receive this word. Amen. I don't want the devil to dilute me in any way. I want to stand with the word. As long as the word says something, I want to say amen. I believe it. I want to live by it. I don't want to live half-hazardly. I I don't want to live as uh somebody who doesn't know where I am going. I want to say I know who I am. I know where I stand and I know where I am going. I have this secret virtue of the word which the Lord has entrusted me with. I want to believe it with all my heart. I don't want to shift it or or compromise here, compromise there. It's a a sacred virtue that we have been given. Praise God. We cannot replace it with manmade creatures and wisdom and denominations and it is either the word or it is nothing. Praise God. Praise God. We we should not compromise. Let us stay with the word. Let us believe the word even when the situation becomes tough. Brothers, stay with the word. Sisters, stay with the word because it's a sacred virtue. The trust which has been given to you, if you hold this word faithfully, the Lord will bless you. He will increase you. Amen. Don't compromise it. Don't compromise it for anything. Whatever you need, if you are faithful with the principles of the word, you will receive it. Hallelujah. It's not a doubt. There's no doubt. If you want to be married, it's a desire. The word says he will give you whatsoever things you desire. So if you have a desire, check yourself. How are you standing with the word? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're standing like that, correct yourself. Put yourself in tune and then request your desire. He said, I will give you whatever you desire. If you want a job, if you want promotion, whatever you desire, everything is in the word. No compromise. We stand with the word and we will see his blessing. If you have not tested, some have tested and we have seen that the Lord is good and he will give you everything. Tell your neighbor, he will give you everything. He will give you everything. God bless you. You can stand up on your feet. Hallelujah. Let's give him a clap of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's not enough for the Lord now. Come on, give him a cup of praise. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. There is a way. Well, I sought the Lord and he answered me. Give us the words, brother. &gt;&gt; And delivered me from Mary. Those who look on him, [Music] they'll never be ashamed. &gt;&gt; Come on. There'll never be &gt;&gt; will this poor man cry. &gt;&gt; And the Lord and me. and save me from my enemy.

Just water the word. Water the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat.
