[58:02] The Bible says
[58:09] uh let me start on verse 14. Acts
[58:12] 14:14-17
[58:15] uh which when the apostles Barnabas and
[58:18] Paul heard of they rent their clothes
[58:21] and ran in among the people crying out
[58:24] and saying
[58:26] why do you these things? We also are men
[58:29] of like passions
[58:32] with you. And you preach unto you that
[58:35] you should turn from these vanities unto
[58:37] the living God, which made heaven and
[58:40] earth uh and the sea and all things that
[58:46] are therein. Who in times past suffered
[58:49] all nations to walk in their own ways.
[58:52] Nevertheless, he left not himself
[58:55] without witness. In that he did good and
[58:59] gave us rain from heaven and fruitful
[59:03] seasons, filling our hearts with food
[59:06] and gladness. Amen.
[59:09] [Music]

[1:00:36] whatever you are giving away,
[1:00:40] whatever you are losing,
[1:00:45] you are not losing it. If you give it,
[1:00:47] you are giving.
[1:00:50] If it is time, he gives it back to you
[1:00:53] more.
[1:00:55] Double double. If it is money, he gives
[1:00:59] it back. Double double.
[1:01:03] If it is your life, he gives it back.
[1:01:07] Eternal.
[1:01:09] Just whatever you give to him. If it is
[1:01:12] children,
[1:01:14] Anna gave him gave him samson.
[1:01:20] God multiplied
[1:01:23] gave her more children like it is

[1:01:29] Amen.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; So your your sleep
[1:01:34] that you have sacrificed
[1:01:37] it will come back to you.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amina.
[1:01:48] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:01:50] today I want to talk about
[1:01:53] my subject is but there was a believer.
[1:02:00] But there was a believer.
[1:02:09] But there was a believer.
[1:02:14] As I was coming in the taxi,
[1:02:17] &gt;&gt; I happened, you know, I didn't intend
[1:02:19] it.
[1:02:21] &gt;&gt; I just I looked in front
[1:02:25] and there was this young lady,
[1:02:28] not lady, young woman.
[1:02:30] Because a lady is different from a
[1:02:32] woman,
[1:02:35] young woman. And she was on her phone
[1:02:39] scrolling, scrolling
[1:02:41] [Music]
[1:02:43] endless scrolling.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; So she had nothing to do, no nothing
[1:02:49] sensible.
[1:02:52] And she went maybe on some group.
[1:02:56] Hello, is anyone here?
[1:03:00] I feel like vibing.
[1:03:04] I said, "Oh,
[1:03:06] if you don't have what to to to if you
[1:03:09] do not have something to do,
[1:03:14] the devil will give you something.
[1:03:17] If you are scrolling,
[1:03:20] you know these are days of endless
[1:03:22] scrolling.
[1:03:25] get your phone and you go on YouTube
[1:03:29] and you start scrolling
[1:03:32] and scrolling
[1:03:34] you don't you don't have anything you
[1:03:36] are searching
[1:03:38] then YouTube will give you an option
[1:03:42] then you stop a moment you look you
[1:03:45] watch for some few minutes it will drop
[1:03:48] you of that same kind another
[1:03:53] something to look at
[1:03:56] It will give you what to look at.
[1:03:59] You you don't have a purpose
[1:04:02] for what you are doing.
[1:04:04] If you do not have a burden for
[1:04:07] something,
[1:04:10] the devil will give you a burden.
[1:04:12] You know,
[1:04:14] if you have a vineyard
[1:04:19] or a garden and you dig it, you clear
[1:04:23] everything
[1:04:26] and you leave it blame
[1:04:28] and don't put there any seed.
[1:04:33] Trust me,
[1:04:36] something has got to grow in that.
[1:04:43] &gt;&gt; You just watch after a short time,
[1:04:47] you find it fully planted
[1:04:51] by with
[1:04:55] because you didn't have what to plant.
[1:04:58] But you plowed
[1:05:02] So if you don't have something to die
[1:05:04] for,
[1:05:06] the devil gives you something to die
[1:05:08] for.
[1:05:10] &gt;&gt; So that's what happens in the world. The
[1:05:14] people have no program.
[1:05:17] So the devil gives them a program.
[1:05:21] So when we if God has given you a chance
[1:05:24] and an opportunity like this
[1:05:28] and a program like this
[1:05:30] and you have come
[1:05:33] then you are moving with God's program
[1:05:36] if you don't have something to support
[1:05:40] the devil gives you something
[1:05:43] that's what always what happens
[1:05:49] you cannot just be there
[1:05:53] When when you have nothing to talk
[1:05:55] about,
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; he gives you what to talk about.
[1:06:00] &gt;&gt; You have nothing in the heart.
[1:06:03] Satan puts there something.
[1:06:08] So
[1:06:09] you have to put something there.
[1:06:12] You have to do something. If you don't
[1:06:14] have something to think about,
[1:06:16] it will give you a thought.
[1:06:19] So you have got to meditate upon the
[1:06:21] word.
[1:06:26] But there was a believer.
[1:06:30] The Bible said that when Paul and and
[1:06:35] Barnabas
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; went into Lististra
[1:06:39] to preach the gospel, these people when
[1:06:42] they saw the miracle
[1:06:44] that Paul and Barnabas had done, a
[1:06:48] certain man imported in his feet
[1:06:51] being a from his mother's womb
[1:06:55] who never had walked.
[1:06:57] But when Paul was preaching the word
[1:07:01] and he who steadfast beholding him
[1:07:05] when the word is being preached and you
[1:07:08] steady first behold the preacher
[1:07:11] it's not about the preacher it's about
[1:07:13] the one that he looks at the preacher
[1:07:16] when he looks beyond the preacher I look
[1:07:19] at the preacher but
[1:07:26] so the important
[1:07:28] looked beyond the preacher
[1:07:31] beyond the preacher. The preacher looked
[1:07:34] beyond the evil.
[1:07:37] The scripture said and perceiving that
[1:07:40] he had faith to be healed.
[1:07:45] When the man looked beyond
[1:07:48] beyond Paul looked beyond
[1:07:52] contacted faith
[1:07:55] something.
[1:08:00] Listen brother because there was a
[1:08:03] believer that was preaching the word of
[1:08:06] faith
[1:08:08] unto a believer
[1:08:10] and something happened
[1:08:12] for something to happen.
[1:08:15] For something to happen where the word
[1:08:17] is preached, there has got to be two
[1:08:20] believers
[1:08:22] for where two or three
[1:08:25] gather together in my name. I'll be in
[1:08:28] there.
[1:08:30] There has got to be faith with faith.
[1:08:35] The contact of faith.
[1:08:37] Something has got to happen.
[1:08:40] Friction
[1:08:42] friction
[1:08:43] brings a fire. So faith contacts.
[1:08:48] There has got to be something.
[1:08:51] And when that happened, the Bible said,
[1:08:55] when the people saw what Paul had done,
[1:08:59] they lifted up their voices,
[1:09:01] saying in the speech of Leona,
[1:09:05] the gods are come down to us in the
[1:09:08] likeness of men
[1:09:13] like the witch of end
[1:09:17] went to and said, "Call
[1:09:23] somewhere
[1:09:25] and she called and said, "Oh my, the
[1:09:29] gods are coming from there."
[1:09:32] So tell me how does he look like?
[1:09:35] So it says that they said the gods are
[1:09:39] come down
[1:09:42] and they called Barnabas Jupiter.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; They called Barnabas Jupiter Jupiter.
[1:09:49] Oh, murious.
[1:09:52] That was Paul
[1:09:54] because he was the chief speaker.
[1:09:57] Then the priest of Jupiter
[1:09:59] which was before their city
[1:10:02] brought oxen and gallons
[1:10:07] and to the gates and would have done
[1:10:10] sacrifice with the people
[1:10:13] to sacrifice to Paul and Barnabas.
[1:10:17] And when Paul saw this,
[1:10:20] he wrapped his clothing
[1:10:23] and said, "Sir,
[1:10:25] why do you do this thing?
[1:10:28] We also
[1:10:31] are men of like person
[1:10:38] with you and preach unto you that you
[1:10:41] should turn from this valley
[1:10:46] and to the living God
[1:10:49] which made heaven and earth
[1:10:52] and the sea
[1:10:54] and the things that are bear ring.
[1:10:57] [Music]
[1:10:58] Then he say who in times past suffered
[1:11:01] all nation
[1:11:04] to walk in their own way
[1:11:08] in times past. God left all nations
[1:11:14] to walk in their own way.
[1:11:17] Every man do whatever they want.
[1:11:19] The Bible says God wked
[1:11:24] at the sins of the people,
[1:11:27] but that winking is no more.
[1:11:31] But then he did it,
[1:11:33] but not now. And Peter Paul says,
[1:11:37] "Nevertheless,
[1:11:39] he left not himself without witness.
[1:11:47] God can't leave himself without a
[1:11:49] witness.
[1:11:52] He has got to have a witness
[1:11:55] in every place at any time. He has got
[1:11:59] to have a witness.
[1:12:01] It says in that he did good
[1:12:07] and gave us rain from heaven
[1:12:12] and fruitful season,
[1:12:16] filling our hearts with food and
[1:12:18] gladness.
[1:12:21] See, he's not talking about the natural.
[1:12:26] He's talking about the spiritual.
[1:12:29] He gave us rain from heaven
[1:12:32] and beautiful seasons,
[1:12:36] filling our hearts with food and
[1:12:39] gladness.
[1:12:42] He's talking about the word. He's
[1:12:44] talking about showers of blessings.
[1:12:48] He's talking about the blessings of the
[1:12:50] Holy Spirit.
[1:12:52] He's talking about the season of the
[1:12:54] Holy Spirit.
[1:12:56] You talk about the joy of the Lord.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; My subject is
[1:13:03] but there was a believer.
[1:13:07] It says God can't leave himself without
[1:13:10] a witness.
[1:13:13] How I came to this
[1:13:17] I was uh following the dedication of the
[1:13:19] church building in where pastor went.
[1:13:22] [Music]
[1:13:27] I'm not going to talk about church
[1:13:28] beauty.
[1:13:32] I'm going to talk about church building.
[1:13:35] But when you are dedicating the church,
[1:13:39] Bible believers,
[1:13:43] I was listening to the testimonies of
[1:13:45] the treasurer
[1:13:48] as he was giving the account how they
[1:13:50] went through.
[1:13:53] And it showed that at every point there
[1:13:56] came points or times
[1:14:00] it looked like they didn't know what to
[1:14:02] do
[1:14:05] at some point.
[1:14:08] But when those times came and the
[1:14:10] testimony was he was saying but there
[1:14:15] was a believer
[1:14:17] I said oh my
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; I like that
[1:14:21] but there was a
[1:14:33] good
[1:14:35] believer
[1:14:37] he
[1:14:38] There is a time we had 30%
[1:14:42] deposit
[1:14:46] and he said some believers
[1:14:49] their possession
[1:14:51] even cars
[1:14:53] to to to
[1:14:57] somebody
[1:14:59] on the land. And then he said challenges
[1:15:03] came at their rental area
[1:15:06] and they decided to put a temporary
[1:15:08] structure.
[1:15:11] And he said when they made that decision
[1:15:14] to put a temporary structure at the land
[1:15:17] which they had bought so that they
[1:15:19] renting.
[1:15:21] He said that was a believer
[1:15:24] who felt
[1:15:27] a lump sum of money.
[1:15:29] I said
[1:15:31] there was a believer
[1:15:33] every time there was a believer
[1:15:36] and he said we needed a scaffold
[1:15:38] scaffolding
[1:15:44] to surround the entire building
[1:15:46] so that they can build up. They needed
[1:15:48] much
[1:15:53] from another church. They gave us all
[1:15:56] the scapula.
[1:15:57] I said I was a believer. Then he said we
[1:16:02] come to roofing
[1:16:05] we needed quite a great amount of money
[1:16:08] but we had only 50%
[1:16:11] and they were stuck.
[1:16:14] He said there was a believer from
[1:16:16] another church. He gave us the 50%
[1:16:20] which was remaining. I said there is
[1:16:23] something here.
[1:16:25] I said I'm enjoying this one.
[1:16:28] Then he said there's a time after we had
[1:16:32] constructed
[1:16:34] there was a believer gave us trees and
[1:16:38] trees and flowers
[1:16:41] said trees and flowers
[1:16:45] said then we needed
[1:16:48] but they didn't have money. There was a
[1:16:51] believer
[1:16:54] what God was doing.
[1:16:57] Give them a desire.
[1:16:59] Then you provide a believing
[1:17:06] a desire become a believer.
[1:17:10] There is a believer.
[1:17:14] God wants to do something.
[1:17:17] God comes to a believer.
[1:17:19] And when he comes to unbeliever,
[1:17:22] he makes them do something to the
[1:17:26] something for a believer.
[1:17:28] God works with the believer.
[1:17:31] Only a believer.
[1:17:33] It's only a believer who will stop
[1:17:38] who will stop
[1:17:42] hear God's voice
[1:17:46] out the task
[1:17:48] no matter the cost.
[1:17:51] It's only the believer
[1:17:53] that will be willing
[1:17:56] to submit
[1:18:00] because a lot of people
[1:18:02] I'm moving to and fro
[1:18:05] to about
[1:18:08] believer is not just a confession to
[1:18:10] other
[1:18:12] believer is a believer.
[1:18:15] someone that God has confidence.
[1:18:20] God said, "I know Abraham.
[1:18:25] I know Abraham."
[1:18:28] That was a believer
[1:18:31] that God stood and said, "I know Abraham
[1:18:35] that he will command his seat.
[1:18:40] This one, I know
[1:18:43] that was a believer. A believer is
[1:18:47] someone that knows God.
[1:18:50] God knows him.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; It is I 1961.
[1:18:58] &gt;&gt; He says he has no voice
[1:19:02] tonight
[1:19:03] but our voice.
[1:19:06] He has no hands
[1:19:08] but our hands.
[1:19:11] He has your hands.
[1:19:15] God has no feet, brother.
[1:19:17] your feet. He has no lips but your lips.
[1:19:22] But for him,
[1:19:24] your body become his temple.
[1:19:29] Be a believer.
[1:19:32] Be a believer.
[1:19:34] A believer
[1:19:37] and always there is a believer.
[1:19:42] It was in the days of Noah brother. The
[1:19:45] Bible says every man was moving
[1:19:48] according to the imagination.
[1:19:52] Evil filled the earth.
[1:19:55] Everyone took women whenever they
[1:19:56] decided
[1:19:59] even in the midst of those days.
[1:20:02] There was still a believer.
[1:20:05] Noah was a believer that drove amongst
[1:20:08] unbelievers
[1:20:10] and he was a witness and a living
[1:20:13] testimony.
[1:20:14] When God decided to save a few souls,
[1:20:18] he had to come to believe
[1:20:21] someone that would believe
[1:20:24] something that is unbelievable.
[1:20:27] Oh brother, it was beyond
[1:20:30] human mind could contain
[1:20:34] to take a believer
[1:20:36] that does not take God by the mind.
[1:20:40] A believer
[1:20:42] that does not take God by the mind
[1:20:47] but by faith.
[1:20:51] Your mind is too small to contain God.
[1:20:58] So God came to Noah
[1:21:00] who was a believer
[1:21:04] and he said you know brother let us
[1:21:06] build
[1:21:09] because God
[1:21:10] could not come down himself.
[1:21:14] Yes, he can. But his principles,
[1:21:18] he cannot go against
[1:21:21] a prisoner to his own what
[1:21:26] he's a prisoner to his own.
[1:21:29] He cannot bypass his word.
[1:21:32] That's why when you come to God,
[1:21:35] don't come with emotions.
[1:21:38] We appreciate emotions.
[1:21:41] Emotions are part of
[1:21:44] religion without emotions is dead.
[1:21:48] But when you come to talk to God,
[1:21:53] just emotions.
[1:21:55] Come with the word, you put it before
[1:21:57] God.
[1:22:00] He is a prisoner to his own.
[1:22:04] He said the word and he put it before
[1:22:06] God.
[1:22:08] He says,
[1:22:10] "Let us make
[1:22:13] and because he was a believer, he obeyed
[1:22:16] the voice of God." He stopped a moment,
[1:22:19] brother.
[1:22:22] And he said, "You know what?
[1:22:25] We are going to save cows.
[1:22:29] We save some goats.
[1:22:31] We save some
[1:22:35] lions.
[1:22:40] No, I would have said
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; why would you all
[1:22:46] the lions will eat me?
[1:22:49] I didn't ask that.
[1:22:51] I don't see it in the Bible.
[1:22:54] He just
[1:22:57] and he stood at the door and the lion
[1:23:00] came in. I said, "Oh,
[1:23:05] [Music]
[1:23:08] So brother when was those days
[1:23:11] was those days before the fall
[1:23:16] after the fall
[1:23:20] but because this was a believer
[1:23:24] he could not he knew that God is what
[1:23:29] turn against him.
[1:23:31] No brother. So in the days of Enoch,
[1:23:35] there's no man that was talking about
[1:23:37] the rapture,
[1:23:39] no man that could think about it,
[1:23:42] no man that could was calling upon it.
[1:23:45] But there was a believer. His name was
[1:23:50] no man was thinking about pleasing God
[1:23:54] or doing something for God. And the
[1:23:57] Bible says that Enoch had a testimony
[1:24:02] that he had pleased the Lord.
[1:24:06] Which Bible did he read?
[1:24:08] All the stars he read.
[1:24:11] How did God communicate to him?
[1:24:14] Did he live to hear
[1:24:18] other way? But he was able to stop a
[1:24:21] moment
[1:24:23] and hear the voice of God.
[1:24:25] Stop a moment because there was a
[1:24:28] tinkling in his head
[1:24:31] in him calling
[1:24:34] a deep calling to the deep
[1:24:36] because he was a believer
[1:24:40] and he lived in those days
[1:24:42] until he was raptured
[1:24:45] that he but before the translation
[1:24:49] he had pleased God.
[1:24:51] Brother, sister, a believer is God is a
[1:24:55] type
[1:24:57] is God is a type
[1:25:01] of what God is going to do.
[1:25:06] Sometime a believer
[1:25:08] is someone that God does with what he
[1:25:11] has to do.
[1:25:18] He has nothing else but a believer.
[1:25:22] Not just a man, a woman. Once a believer
[1:25:31] &gt;&gt; in the days of Abraham and in the days
[1:25:34] of Lot, the days of Sodom, the the city
[1:25:38] of Sodom
[1:25:40] had so much corrupted itself
[1:25:44] that the Bible say when God came down,
[1:25:49] it said that the cry of it
[1:25:53] has come to me.
[1:25:56] The cry of Sodom.
[1:25:59] But who was crying?
[1:26:04] Who was crying for the sinner?
[1:26:08] Was it Lord?
[1:26:10] Could it be?
[1:26:12] Was it Abra?
[1:26:14] Who was he? But look, brother. He said
[1:26:18] the cry of it
[1:26:20] as he reached unto him.
[1:26:24] And when God came down,
[1:26:27] he said, "Shall I hide this from
[1:26:30] Abraham,
[1:26:33] seeing he's going to be a father
[1:26:38] of many nations,
[1:26:40] he said, I come to die." Then he says,
[1:26:44] Abraham, I'm going down there
[1:26:48] in
[1:26:52] the cry of the
[1:26:54] a lot of wickedness there.
[1:26:57] I'm going there to destroy
[1:27:02] Abraham did not say but that's the
[1:27:05] scripture
[1:27:08] wicked the wicked repent.
[1:27:12] Abraham was a believer.
[1:27:16] He didn't say well.
[1:27:18] That's the word of God.
[1:27:21] God has said it's going to destroy us.
[1:27:24] Oh sir
[1:27:26] say oh come
[1:27:28] a moment
[1:27:30] what 50
[1:27:35] will you destroy the right
[1:27:39] because he was delivered
[1:27:44] but if there be some
[1:27:50] but
[1:27:55] As long as it is well with my soul,
[1:27:59] you are not a believer.
[1:28:04] I don't think there is any hopes for
[1:28:06] them.
[1:28:08] You are not a believer.
[1:28:13] Well, we are the only people.
[1:28:19] You are not a believer.
[1:28:22] Abraham said, "What if
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; I don't know, but
[1:28:28] there is a probability.
[1:28:32] There is a probability.
[1:28:35] Isn't that really a believer
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:38] in the whole city?" Because God can't be
[1:28:43] without a witness.
[1:28:45] He said I believe I not
[1:28:50] and God said if there be 100
[1:28:53] I won't distress
[1:28:55] but Abraham said
[1:28:59] 100
[1:29:02] God has come down
[1:29:06] what
[1:29:10] I want
[1:29:13] God is saying quickly
[1:29:16] What if
[1:29:20] I won't destroy you?
[1:29:24] Okay Lord, since you have permitted me
[1:29:26] to speak,
[1:29:28] let me speak.
[1:29:31] F10
[1:29:34] say even
[1:29:39] stop today.
[1:29:42] He was interceding
[1:29:46] for the for that righteous man
[1:29:50] that might be in
[1:29:53] there.
[1:29:56] And there was a believer
[1:30:00] And God went for that gift
[1:30:04] to out the believer.
[1:30:07] Always God will choose out.
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:11] You receive blessings.
[1:30:13] People will testify after the service.
[1:30:18] What's wrong with me?
[1:30:21] thing is to believe
[1:30:27] not because you came to church
[1:30:31] because you believe.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, that's hard to take in.
[1:30:39] saying that the blessing is to believe
[1:30:46] and there has got to be a believer
[1:30:50] because God cannot do anything
[1:30:54] except
[1:30:56] there is a believer.
[1:30:58] Anytime you see God doing something,
[1:31:02] you know where there is God, there is a
[1:31:06] believer.
[1:31:08] Hallelujah.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; And where there is a devil,
[1:31:15] there is an unbeliever.
[1:31:17] Where there is flies,
[1:31:20] there is something.
[1:31:25] You can chase away the flies,
[1:31:29] but if that thing is still there,
[1:31:32] they will come back.
[1:31:36] So it's not about most times the devil.
[1:31:40] It's not about the demon.
[1:31:42] There's something behind.
[1:31:46] That's why would say
[1:31:49] don't just cast out demon.
[1:31:52] Let's find out
[1:32:00] why.
[1:32:06] Probably that place is dirty.
[1:32:10] Why were the Why are you slumbering?
[1:32:13] Something is wrong.
[1:32:18] A believer is awake.
[1:32:23] For there was a famine that was
[1:32:26] determined
[1:32:28] upon the land of Egypt
[1:32:31] for about seven years. And God looked
[1:32:34] ahead
[1:32:36] and he saw that famine was to come upon
[1:32:39] the land of Egypt.
[1:32:42] And there was no one that he could talk
[1:32:45] to
[1:32:46] in the land of Egypt.
[1:32:49] Hallelujah. And understand
[1:32:53] [Music]
[1:32:55] that the famine is coming.
[1:32:57] So God went to Israel. Hallelujah. And
[1:33:00] he picked the building.
[1:33:04] Glory to God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, it doesn't matter. No
[1:33:11] matter how far God has to go,
[1:33:14] he will pass this city.
[1:33:17] pass this and he passed this and he
[1:33:20] passed this and he passed this city and
[1:33:24] he come to Uganda and he big
[1:33:28] and take him to Ethiopia
[1:33:30] and he said preach the word
[1:33:34] God
[1:33:37] brother sister he left and he went all
[1:33:40] the way to Israel
[1:33:43] and he brought a believer
[1:33:47] And he walked with him
[1:33:49] and they threw him. They hit him
[1:33:53] and he knew this one is a believer.
[1:33:56] They met him at this one. This is a
[1:33:59] believer.
[1:34:01] They threw him in the pit. But in the
[1:34:04] pit there, God went down there to be
[1:34:08] with his believer.
[1:34:10] Hallelujah.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; And he picked him up from the
[1:34:17] And they had planned brother
[1:34:20] maybe to kill him and he saw that
[1:34:24] and they could not
[1:34:28] destroy a believer
[1:34:31] from the pit. They sold him into
[1:34:35] slavery. God went into slavery
[1:34:39] with his believer.
[1:34:42] Brother I would rather be in the pit.
[1:34:46] But with Jesus,
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; but with Jesus,
[1:34:53] they took him into seven.
[1:34:56] Jesus went
[1:34:59] and to be with his.
[1:35:04] Oh my God.
[1:35:08] And
[1:35:10] what is God do trying to do?
[1:35:14] He wants someone
[1:35:16] that he can talk to in Egypt.
[1:35:21] Hallelujah.
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; So he takes him
[1:35:24] there. From there, they sell him. They
[1:35:27] they throw him into prison. God went to
[1:35:30] prison
[1:35:32] and he was there in prison. He
[1:35:35] disbelieve.
[1:35:41] Brother,
[1:35:42] you can be there
[1:35:45] is where
[1:35:48] Jesus,
[1:35:56] without Jesus,
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; actually a church without trials,
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; it is not, it will never be consecrated.
[1:36:09] It will never be deeply rooted in God
[1:36:13] in prison. God follows
[1:36:19] take sides with Jesus.
[1:36:24] He takes sides with you
[1:36:29] with this believer.
[1:36:33] I'm from prison
[1:36:36] there. I lifted him.
[1:36:38] And he said now let us go to the throne
[1:36:42] sat with his people
[1:36:45] ruled the inter
[1:36:48] then that's when he started to talk you
[1:36:50] know
[1:36:52] he inter he told the dreams came to
[1:36:59] then his believer inter
[1:37:07] It doesn't matter where God has to get
[1:37:09] him,
[1:37:13] but he wants a believer.
[1:37:16] If he has a son of God here,
[1:37:19] a real brother like brother Dixon
[1:37:23] sister,
[1:37:26] if you're okay, I'm not saying you
[1:37:29] say that
[1:37:31] guy is all right.
[1:37:36] you are not a good sister, God will move
[1:37:40] and go somewhere
[1:37:42] and pick a believer
[1:37:44] and give this brother.
[1:37:49] But we we have been friends.
[1:37:58] God wants a believer
[1:38:01] to have a believer.
[1:38:07] He was a dreamer of dreams
[1:38:11] and an interpreter of them
[1:38:15] and a prophet.
[1:38:17] So the word of God could come to him
[1:38:23] so that God could preserve the life of
[1:38:25] the people.
[1:38:30] save them from their calamities.
[1:38:35] So God can pick you
[1:38:38] in your entire family
[1:38:40] to take you somewhere
[1:38:44] just to redeem that
[1:38:49] you are head
[1:38:51] to preserve life.
[1:38:56] But you have got to be a believer.
[1:39:00] First a believer.
[1:39:02] I've said first a.
[1:39:06] And when I say a believer,
[1:39:09] I mean a believer,
[1:39:12] I'm saying a believer.
[1:39:18] He wants that. When brother is talking
[1:39:20] about the squirrels,
[1:39:23] God wants that when this testimony
[1:39:27] is being told
[1:39:30] that the squirrels appreciated,
[1:39:34] God wanted someone
[1:39:38] who can believe that
[1:39:42] while the testimony was being
[1:39:49] There was no believer to say amen.
[1:39:52] But that is impossible.
[1:39:56] Amen.
[1:39:58] As the testimony is being told,
[1:40:02] brothers are not sing
[1:40:06] but there was a believer
[1:40:10] sister there.
[1:40:13] He said a man nothing but the truth
[1:40:16] and God say
[1:40:19] I want a believer.
[1:40:22] Then God came down.
[1:40:25] When God recognizes a believer,
[1:40:29] then he comes down. He said here
[1:40:33] faith
[1:40:35] the believer
[1:40:36] said now this one is a believer.
[1:40:42] When I say ask whatever you want
[1:40:47] this sister,
[1:40:51] she will believe it.
[1:40:54] Brother, if you they could not believe
[1:40:58] the spirit testimony
[1:41:03] neither believe to ask whatever.
[1:41:12] But this one, she believed when he said
[1:41:15] they were created
[1:41:19] and this believer
[1:41:21] said, "Amen. There's nothing but the
[1:41:24] truth. God is saying I the believer I
[1:41:28] want to do it again. What I did with
[1:41:31] you, I want to do it with this other
[1:41:33] people.
[1:41:35] was the faith that was with you to speak
[1:41:39] the spirit
[1:41:42] faith with this
[1:41:46] sister
[1:41:48] ask you what you want
[1:41:50] and sister
[1:41:52] at the salvation of
[1:41:55] there was a believer
[1:41:57] was a believer and she was there when
[1:42:01] the testimonies
[1:42:03] are being God and this is the testimony
[1:42:07] of Jesus.
[1:42:09] He demands
[1:42:11] or he desires or he wants and it is a
[1:42:15] must.
[1:42:17] ought to be a believer and when a
[1:42:19] believer believes
[1:42:21] something has got
[1:42:24] listen brother
[1:42:28] I believe sister would have asked for
[1:42:29] more
[1:42:33] like the salvation of my two boys
[1:42:41] she was poor
[1:42:44] some billionaire
[1:42:52] would have said
[1:42:54] to live. I want to live till the Lord
[1:42:56] Jesus comes.
[1:43:01] God would have
[1:43:04] and keeps asking.
[1:43:09] God was not afraid.
[1:43:15] God was not afraid.
[1:43:18] Listen brother, when God comes into
[1:43:21] contact with the people,
[1:43:24] he pours out himself,
[1:43:30] he gives out himself.
[1:43:32] That is where he puts his body. When he
[1:43:34] meets a believer,
[1:43:40] now ask what you want. You have defeated
[1:43:42] me. Jesus
[1:43:45] said such faith I've never seen
[1:43:51] there is a believer
[1:44:00] why is the plan stopping
[1:44:05] I don't understand this
[1:44:08] I'm just walking Lord
[1:44:11] what's the matter what's the
[1:44:14] Keep walking.
[1:44:19] Lord, the plan is leaving me.
[1:44:23] [Music]
[1:44:26] Oh Lord, they leaving me. I'm too
[1:44:33] God has a good time
[1:44:36] when he meets a believer.
[1:44:40] Brother,
[1:44:42] let us keep
[1:44:50] no sight. No, sir.
[1:44:55] I can't miss the opportunity of taking a
[1:44:57] flight. This is the devil stopping you
[1:45:00] from going to the airport.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; All right, keep walking.
[1:45:09] And before you know,
[1:45:12] there was someone waiting.
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; How are you?
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; How did you know I'm a pastor?
[1:45:25] There was a believer
[1:45:28] that stopped the plane.
[1:45:32] There was a believer
[1:45:34] that believed that the God of the woman
[1:45:39] is not today that is alive and if he's
[1:45:43] alive where is Elijah
[1:45:46] where is Elijah brother sister because
[1:45:50] there was a believer
[1:45:53] the plan is stopped
[1:45:55] and before you know there is my son
[1:46:00] And the son says
[1:46:05] as they pray the son says mama
[1:46:14] faith
[1:46:16] faith
[1:46:18] of the mother
[1:46:19] of the
[1:46:21] pollution
[1:46:23] supernatural friction
[1:46:26] fire came out
[1:46:30] It's right here
[1:46:37] to be
[1:46:39] &gt;&gt; Johnny today.
[1:46:42] Billionaires
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; in the church brotherion.
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; As long as there is a believer,
[1:46:49] God can do it again
[1:46:51] and again and again. There is no reason
[1:46:54] to doubt.
[1:46:57] [Music]
[1:46:58] Let there be a believer
[1:47:01] and meet God.
[1:47:06] Oh brother,
[1:47:09] just be a believer.
[1:47:12] Be a believer.
[1:47:14] See how you attract God.
[1:47:20] But God being attracted
[1:47:24] M
[1:47:27] brother rock
[1:47:31] let us go down there.
[1:47:34] Let us go down. God is attractive.
[1:47:38] He sees the children are praying.
[1:47:41] The mother is praying.
[1:47:43] The husband is praying.
[1:47:46] He loves his wife. She respects her
[1:47:49] message.
[1:47:51] just a good atmosphere.
[1:47:54] They reading the word. They keep
[1:47:56] themselves in that atmosphere.
[1:47:59] And God says,
[1:48:02] "Have you noticed
[1:48:05] there is a believer?
[1:48:11] Where have you been?
[1:48:14] Have you noticed?
[1:48:17] Did you pass the land of
[1:48:20] you see what is?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; What did you see?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; You know politics
[1:48:29] politician.
[1:48:33] Didn't you see?
[1:48:36] You know what I saw?
[1:48:38] I saw
[1:48:40] a lot of denominations
[1:48:42] work there.
[1:48:44] I'm taking over there.
[1:48:47] A lot of religious men
[1:48:49] [Music]
[1:48:51] gatherings in the chap
[1:48:54] ritualistic for
[1:48:58] there it's a good I'm having a good time
[1:49:00] in the land of
[1:49:08] my
[1:49:13] Oh,
[1:49:16] &gt;&gt; that one.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; Do you think he
[1:49:25] &gt;&gt; God said
[1:49:27] don't brag
[1:49:30] there is a believer?
[1:49:34] Have you noticed that?
[1:49:37] This is what the devil does.
[1:49:40] He comes and tells you
[1:49:43] have you seen that sister
[1:49:45] I won't point in anyone
[1:49:48] in this
[1:49:50] but I always sit there
[1:49:54] so
[1:49:56] tell you there is a sister that sister
[1:50:00] look
[1:50:02] did you see what she did when you out
[1:50:04] there
[1:50:07] what do you These people have anything
[1:50:09] around them
[1:50:12] just
[1:50:19] see what brother Julius did the other
[1:50:21] time.
[1:50:24] Come on. You are too forgetful.
[1:50:30] So can you convince me?
[1:50:36] But he won't tell you.
[1:50:40] Did you see what that sister how she
[1:50:43] shouted?
[1:50:47] Do you see how she dresses lady?
[1:50:51] Do you see how that brother is kind?
[1:50:55] &gt;&gt; He doesn't show you that.
[1:50:59] He will just always point you to the
[1:51:01] negative
[1:51:03] because he is the accuser of the
[1:51:09] so just keep pointing to you negatives
[1:51:15] until you stand to be the only
[1:51:17] righteous.
[1:51:24] When I look at these people,
[1:51:27] it seems I'm the only holy person here.
[1:51:30] I pray much. I really give a lot. I am
[1:51:35] the best caretaker. I am the happiest
[1:51:37] person here. I am the friend to
[1:51:40] everybody here.
[1:51:42] These people others have a problem.
[1:51:46] You are the one who has got problem.
[1:51:49] But I'm saying
[1:51:53] there is a believer.
[1:51:56] So what do I talk about here? That it
[1:51:59] has got to be that way. like in the days
[1:52:03] of the judges.
[1:52:05] There come a time that the Philistines
[1:52:08] were taking everything
[1:52:12] the people had
[1:52:15] and God is coming down and is saying
[1:52:21] you might
[1:52:29] wait a bit.
[1:52:32] If God be with us,
[1:52:37] well then be all his miracles.
[1:52:41] In other words, if you say, "I'm a
[1:52:44] believer."
[1:52:46] Where are the miracles of believer?
[1:52:50] The one we believe.
[1:52:53] This one was a believer.
[1:52:56] He wasn't a skeptic.
[1:53:00] Asking a question doesn't make you an
[1:53:01] unbeliever.
[1:53:07] If a brother or sister is asking
[1:53:08] something,
[1:53:10] &gt;&gt; it doesn't mean that they're
[1:53:11] unbelievers.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; He wants to know.
[1:53:14] So he says, "Where are the miracles of
[1:53:17] God?"
[1:53:20] He says, "You go, you will deliver
[1:53:22] Israel."
[1:53:26] Maybe he was a little skinny young.
[1:53:29] Oh, a man but just small slings.
[1:53:34] God said you a mighty man
[1:53:37] because he saw that this one is a
[1:53:41] believer.
[1:53:44] Can you imagine
[1:53:46] God was attracted?
[1:53:52] You left all the way from there and
[1:53:54] came. Say it. Now your mom.
[1:53:59] You are here doing your work.
[1:54:02] Your friends and brothers are crying.
[1:54:05] You are just here grinding your wheat.
[1:54:08] You are real believer.
[1:54:11] Others are crying. It's good to cry.
[1:54:15] You break down and cry and cry and cry.
[1:54:20] But
[1:54:24] after crying
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; and strengthen yourself in God
[1:54:36] don't remain in crying you know in the
[1:54:39] book of
[1:54:41] the Bible says
[1:54:46] when David returned with his
[1:54:49] they found Their city was besieged
[1:54:53] and they took all the children, the
[1:54:54] women and everything.
[1:54:57] And the men cried, they all weeped until
[1:55:01] they could cry no more.
[1:55:07] Now, if you can't cry no more, the next
[1:55:11] thing
[1:55:14] if you cry and you can't cry no more,
[1:55:16] what you do?
[1:55:18] I'm tired, sick, and tired.
[1:55:27] Even if he's not a believer now. Now
[1:55:33] after Christ,
[1:55:38] you are a problem to me.
[1:55:41] Now,
[1:55:43] after all that crying and tears have
[1:55:46] dried, we want to see what you're doing
[1:55:49] next.
[1:55:51] Are you really a believer?
[1:55:53] A believer can cry. After crying,
[1:55:58] the next thing after crying,
[1:56:01] my brother, it is another thing. When
[1:56:04] the weakest of Christians
[1:56:07] go to their knees to pray, all of her
[1:56:12] trembles.
[1:56:14] Why? There is no wicked believer.
[1:56:17] Hallelujah.
[1:56:20] Is as can be.
[1:56:25] Hallelujah.
[1:56:27] Oh brother,
[1:56:29] there has got to be a believer
[1:56:31] because there was a believer
[1:56:34] and there will be a believer
[1:56:36] and you are a believer.
[1:56:39] I want you to turn around and look at
[1:56:41] your neighbor
[1:56:43] of them. You are a believer.
[1:56:47] You are a believer.
[1:56:54] Amen. You are a believer. You are a
[1:56:57] believer
[1:56:59] because God says
[1:57:03] sister. God only needs but a man.
[1:57:08] A man
[1:57:10] that is a believer.
[1:57:13] A woman that's a believer. A preacher,
[1:57:18] that's a believer. A wife, that's a
[1:57:21] believer. A husband, that's a believer.
[1:57:25] Children, that believer, workers that
[1:57:29] are believer,
[1:57:31] leaders,
[1:57:33] believers,
[1:57:35] then God
[1:57:37] can have a good time.
[1:57:40] The children of Israel
[1:57:43] just coming to an end here.
[1:57:45] were in bondage in Egypt. There it all
[1:57:50] seemed all hope is gone.
[1:57:53] But the Bible says that Amra
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; perhaps one of the only ones of the
[1:57:58] nation would climb up a little stairs.
[1:58:05] He would go up the stairs.
[1:58:13] They have beaten me so much. I'm really
[1:58:15] so tired.
[1:58:17] But let me go up the stairs.
[1:58:21] Up the stairs.
[1:58:23] Up the stairs. Up the stairs.
[1:58:27] I'm tired. I keep climbing. I keep
[1:58:31] climbing from glory to glory.
[1:58:37] I keep going higher and higher. And he
[1:58:40] says, "Then I get down.
[1:58:44] and he prayed and he prayed until one
[1:58:48] day
[1:58:50] God came down
[1:58:53] because he was a believer.
[1:58:57] Maybe he called for years,
[1:59:00] years and years
[1:59:02] and there was no answer.
[1:59:05] But something told him
[1:59:07] if he was God in that day,
[1:59:11] he is God today.
[1:59:14] If he come from that day,
[1:59:18] he will come today.
[1:59:21] If he had the other day,
[1:59:24] he will hear today.
[1:59:26] There has got to come be times.
[1:59:30] You say, "But
[1:59:32] if
[1:59:35] He did what he did.
[1:59:39] He will do this also today
[1:59:42] because he was a believer
[1:59:46] day after day,
[1:59:48] night after night.
[1:59:53] Amra,
[1:59:55] why don't you let
[1:59:58] all these young men
[2:00:02] all these others to pray through
[2:00:06] all these young men
[2:00:09] they can pray through.
[2:00:11] He says, "I'm not so sure
[2:00:14] whether Julius is praying.
[2:00:16] I'm not so sure. Let me pray.
[2:00:21] I'm not so sure.
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; I'm not so sure whether he's doing it.
[2:00:27] Let me do it. Brother,
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; a believer.
[2:00:36] When the children of Israel
[2:00:39] were fighting the battles of the Lord,
[2:00:43] fighting after the enemies of the Lord,
[2:00:46] fighting the battles of the king
[2:00:50] and it came that the sun started going
[2:00:53] down
[2:00:55] and darkness was setting.
[2:01:00] There was a believer.
[2:01:02] [Music]
[2:01:03] When he said the sun is going
[2:01:06] Yet we are fighting the battles of the
[2:01:08] Lord.
[2:01:10] And this believer by the names of Joshua
[2:01:14] said, "Oh,
[2:01:16] son, stand still upon
[2:01:22] and moon in the valley of
[2:01:26] stand."
[2:01:30] This was a believer.
[2:01:35] When you're fighting the battles of the
[2:01:37] Lord
[2:01:38] and you see darkness is setting,
[2:01:41] finances going down, yet you are
[2:01:44] fighting for God.
[2:01:46] This is not going right
[2:01:49] and you're studying
[2:01:51] your family. Your home is
[2:01:55] everything is going upside down. Yet
[2:01:57] you're fighting the battles
[2:02:00] justice.
[2:02:02] Jesus.
[2:02:03] Stand still.
[2:02:05] Stand still.
[2:02:07] Stand still.
[2:02:10] The Lord. Stand still.
[2:02:13] Then Jesus will stand still
[2:02:17] and say, "What would you have me do for
[2:02:18] you?
[2:02:20] What would you have me to do for you?"
[2:02:22] Lord, I'm fighting your battles
[2:02:25] and your finances are going low.
[2:02:28] The family is going
[2:02:31] your children are going astray.
[2:02:33] The church I don't understand
[2:02:36] the Lord stand still
[2:02:42] then God is stand
[2:02:50] your battle.
[2:02:52] The Lord stand
[2:02:56] still. When he stands, when he says, "Be
[2:03:00] still. Be still and know that I am God."
[2:03:06] Brother, sister, he can stand his still
[2:03:10] in your finances. He can stand his in
[2:03:13] your marriage. He can stand in your
[2:03:17] ministry. He can stand when you pray. He
[2:03:21] can stand still and give you that
[2:03:23] question.
[2:03:26] He can stand still
[2:03:29] when you call upon his name.
[2:03:32] There is a man, brother.
[2:03:35] Darkness comes in. There is a man that
[2:03:38] can turn on the light.
[2:03:41] Jesus, the light of the world.
[2:03:44] So you don't have to remain
[2:03:46] in the shadows of dark movies.
[2:03:54] You don't have to be that.
[2:03:57] Be a believer.
[2:04:00] He says just be a believer.
[2:04:04] Just be a believer. And if there was
[2:04:07] believers then
[2:04:09] in the days of brother
[2:04:11] when he spoke the word is coming a
[2:04:14] church coming a people and he will speak
[2:04:17] the word and it will flash like
[2:04:19] lightning.
[2:04:22] It will flash like lightning.
[2:04:25] If your word is the word of God, I will
[2:04:29] call for a meeting
[2:04:31] to perform your word. And then he says,
[2:04:35] it shall come to pass in the last day
[2:04:38] that a brother shall say to a brother, I
[2:04:43] give you rain. And a brother, if you are
[2:04:46] here, you want the rain, I give you
[2:04:49] rain, in the name of Jesus, I give you
[2:04:52] showers.
[2:04:55] blessing in the name of Jesus because
[2:04:59] the commandment that God gives a
[2:05:01] believer is to bless a believer.
[2:05:05] You brother, he says, I am under
[2:05:09] instruction.
[2:05:10] I am inspired
[2:05:13] to to speak the word and see it perform
[2:05:18] you speak
[2:05:20] and what you speak
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; shall be established.
[2:05:25] Oh brother,
[2:05:26] &gt;&gt; you turn this way. You turn that way,
[2:05:29] you go that way.
[2:05:32] Go to a believer,
[2:05:34] you need another rank.
[2:05:37] I had one believer.
[2:05:39] I had a believer.
[2:05:42] I had a believer
[2:05:44] saying he told another believer
[2:05:48] you need a rank.
[2:05:51] I give you that rank and I saw the
[2:05:54] testimony of the rank.
[2:05:57] What do you need brother?
[2:06:08] by a believer and bless the believer.
[2:06:12] Hallelujah. Amen. And today just right
[2:06:15] now in the name of Jesus, I don't care.
[2:06:20] If it is marriage, I give it to you. In
[2:06:23] the name of Jesus, if it is healing, let
[2:06:26] it come to you in the name of Jesus. All
[2:06:29] things are possible.
[2:06:32] You have waited, waited too long, gosh,
[2:06:38] God, you don't have a job. I give you
[2:06:40] the job and go
[2:06:44] in the name of Jesus. I'm under
[2:06:46] instruction.
[2:06:48] I'm under instruction by the word of
[2:06:50] God, by the spirit of God to give you
[2:06:54] what I've received.
[2:06:58] Receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. You
[2:07:02] are empty. And you are empty. Empty
[2:07:05] here. Give the spirit in the name of
[2:07:08] Jesus. Open your heart. Open your heart

[2:08:17] promote you to take you where you want
[2:08:22] they say you are connected I'm connected
[2:08:27] but right now
[2:08:29] right now we are connected
[2:08:32] to the spiritual whatever company
[2:08:36] whatever company that you don't have a
[2:08:38] connection

[2:09:07] If I perish, I perish. I'm a believer. I
[2:09:11] don't care. Whatever comes my way, my
[2:09:15] life is in the hands of God." A
[2:09:18] believer, he stands and he says,
[2:09:22] me yet.
[2:09:27] Even if God doesn't come, but I trust
[2:09:30] him. Even if he doesn't come today, I'll
[2:09:33] call on him. Even if they don't believe,
[2:09:37] I will testify.

[2:10:02] brother through the everything through
[2:10:05] the trials through the fires through the
[2:10:09] waters. He says, "I'll be with you." And
[2:10:13] in Isaiah,
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; he says, "I will help you." And again,
[2:10:19] he says, "This poor man,
[2:10:22] this poor man cried out to the Lord."
[2:10:25] And God prayless
[2:10:34] cries out to the Lord.
[2:10:38] at their cry
[2:10:40] them
[2:10:43] blessing in the name of Jesus. Brother,

[2:11:29] and I know that if I do all the things
[2:11:34] he will send me to hell at the end I
[2:11:38] will still go to hell talking of the
[2:11:41] love of Jesus
[2:11:43] of the love of Jesus
[2:11:45] if it satisfies him to send me to hell

[2:12:09] sister, as we approach the throne of
[2:12:12] God,
[2:12:13] brother, you have got to have a button
[2:12:15] for

[2:12:27] God came down and he got an unbeliever
[2:12:30] and he said, "Look, give Nemiah what he

[2:13:10] word meet a believer. As the musicians
[2:13:13] place glory,
