tonight to have a Vista from Nairobi Nairobi [Music] amen Amina so I told you it will be you who will get tired but I will bring them all foreign [Music] good to know him some years ago and some of you have been on our chat website you you have seen his picture and that of his wife because they were with us when we first started in the home Village and so while we are standing we see one chorus and then we invite him just usually on Wednesday we have a short time three minutes [Music] so we want to make use of it amen at first that you kept grade up and executives but I'm telling you it's uh it was a wonderful time the same Jesus who came to us visit us on Sunday yes I'm walking right under the block I'm walking right under the blood I'm walking right under the blood I've been walking right I'm not a block where the devil will do me though [Applause] [Music] I'm Gonna Leave [Music] I greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ sorry I've got a short the song but I believe it's because we have a short time today [Music] we just want to put some emphasis on the world because that is what propels us to go to that land where we can sing forever it is okay for us to sing here and we should sing and sing and sing and sing but the only thing that is going to take us there foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] this is a wonderful structure So speaking in the physical point of view category I am happy to be associated with you today but most importantly to be associated with the one God chapter 4. we will also pick a portion from The Book of Proverbs but we shall see it as we continue just for the short time that we shall be here I believe that the Lord is going to speak to us trusting that you have prayed up I solicit your prayers as well let us read in the name of our Lord Jesus in The Book of Malachi chapter 4 this this is uh this will be I believe us and them you know there are things [Music] foreign all right you're here that is the spirit of football and all those kind of things if there is a lineup we should know where two Bankers because these are the things that we identify with let us get in the spirit today I am not bringing anything new this is and most importantly this message of Grace that we've received in this house I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse is foreign [Music] may you restore those that need restoration reignite the fire of the Holy Ghost in those that has gone to him foreign [Music] uh the rest of the days we shall continue but just to sort of play a foundation I'll be speaking about I'll be speaking about tuned let us read in the Book of Proverbs 17 verse 6. it is here children's children are the crown of old men and the glory of children are their fathers [Music] catch those words are the crown of old men in this place it is speaking about grandchildren these grandchildren they are crowns to their grandfathers and we all know the relationship between our grandfather and the grandchildren yeah is the father of the mother about to spank the child they're usually like no no no no no I I believe I'm speaking I'm not speaking something strange this is something that this is something that is real yeah you know it is because these grandchildren yes it really it really they have a certain connection and it is you cannot get a crown out of nothing so this grant this grandparents they raised their children and I want to believe they raised them right so when the grandchildren come on there's some more enjoying to see the work they did in their children and that is why we see here and the glory of the children and [Music] foreign Allah because they are very strong words here that the glory of the children are their fathers favorite someone the Bible tells us that a good man is he who lives an inheritance for his children so the glory of the children is their father I want you to look at the normal world today a child that has grown in a stable family I would say um there is a certain security that this child has the certain confidence that this child has and I believe that is what the Bible is the glory of the children these are children even as they are playing with other children [Music] they will go and tell their children you know my father has all the money what is happening the father is the glory of this child that is right you may not have anything but that is why it is so important especially to us as parents to realize that we are the people responsible for imparting Glory to our families because you see according to them according to these children is even more powerful than the president meet some children please for the glory of the children let us talk to the scripture because we've read in the Book of Malachi there is a promise but I want us to see something here anything to do with the children of God I want us to come up here I want us to come up here and about all these things I want you to put yourself in the scripture I want you to put yourself in the scripture because you want to get to a place we can see ourselves identification he says that when you fail to see yourself [Music] want to see ourselves in Proverbs today we want to see ourselves in Malachi chapter 4 today not tomorrow today because if you do not see yourself in the scripture today do not see yourself in the scripture every time you read the Bible oh brother sister then we are the most I don't know how to think you need we we need to be pretty oh well most of my Bible did not tell them we are the most beautiful people what was the purpose of sin that we received our message the whole Bible blame to us such a Bible you're not judges for you to see yourself in the Bible where on somebody else [Music] don't worry I'll be I'll be you know just moving from place to place I believe that it is important that these things can stick did not make it come to pass and the title of my sermon is like two sentences foreign yeah that was the message that was the message we might try to complicate it foreign we are no longer preaching Mysteries [Music] oh we are no longer preaching Mysteries because the greatest Mysteries when you find a preacher that is trying to make the Bible a mystery foreign foreign I don't know if you're catching somebody the fact that you believe this message and getting towards the fact that you believe this message you even come before Elijah if we were so Canadian Daddy there will not be no need for Elijah you want me but they won't wake up without Mary Mary the angel will not have come down so see yourself there cut the weight I mean Lord I will send you so you are that important to God [Music] Amina foreign I really love Bible language not hearts and he shall turn their hearts and then they choose all the fathers to the children and their hearts no mutima we know now the part A of the scriptures but this is our part now and the Heart of the children [Music] remember don't forget Proverbs the glory of the children is the glory of their children hallelujah hallelujah was to turn the heart of the children I want us to go it slowly because I believe there's some important things here that's I I really fear I really hear the ministry of teaching you can actually when the Bible itself warns against each other and teachers are the ones but I'm finding myself just going in that direction I believe it's for the benefit of someone somewhere I just pray that the Lord shall help me do not say anything wrong I believe there's a Ministry [Music] towards the building of the house of the Lord now we're talking about tuned students now I want to maybe just to break down the word a little bit to tune something is to make certain adjustments oh it is with a certain intention there is some tuning that has been done adjustments that have been made the purpose of the adjustments is that you may hear the sound through the musicians we have things like guitars that need to be tuned they have to be adjusted so they hit the right key right at the rights that is the meaning of the word opportunity that is to make an adjustments it means to move or change directions from one way to another Obama we are talking about tuned to town it is just a thought that the Lord placed on my heart because we've read about the Turning of the hearts Is Not Just Happening like that there is something that is going to happen and to enable them to come now we know our turning is not directionless foreign foreign ERS [Music] but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets [Music] Jesus Christ himself blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus so this is where this is where katiwano or rather this is a this is the foundation on which we are being built upon frequency I just want to also quote something in the church series I know these are things that we know but my desire is that today they shall just become a reality we can remind ourselves of these things [Music] according to Malachi 4. the hearts of the children to the fathers and we agree that we are the children not and we agree on that says and that their fathers are the apostles he will reveal the mysteries of the Thunder of the seven thunders in Revelation 10. which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be this divinely revealed Mrs that literally turned the heart of the children to the Pentecostals Amina so there's going to be a substance Kathy why do you not far away Chilli what will cause the tanning what is the substance divinely revealed mystery truth [Music] it is this divinely revealed mystery truth [Music] there is a reason why you could not stay with your trousers then what the throne I'm I'm failing to get one word yes because you are tuned in the wrong baptism that you are baptized because this divinely revealed mystery truth is amen hallelujah I'll catch this before we get to Malachi chapter 4 verse the Bible tells us up there to remember you know who that is [Music] Institute [Music] foreign [Music] is [Music] he will put them in foreign [Music] I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things [Music] up though you know them and be established in the present truth yeah I think it meets as long as I am in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance so the problem that God had cartoon you can just read something in Deuteronomy chapter 10 verse 16. now today money of your cut it is you know we all have ever seen someone who is foreign [Music] foreign not tell you foreign foreign foreign foreign you can just maybe quickly who shall Ascend into the hill of the law or who shall stand in his holy place the presence of the Lord but the question is who is going to do that is he that have clean hands foreign strangers in a foreign that it is God is under had in the hearts of Faith he is not the one that hardened the heart of the Israelites the Israelites had a choice to make [Music] God hardened the heart of pharaoh God can have a chance to display his powerful and by displaying his power it was supposed to tune the hearts of the Israelites to remind the children of Israel about the promises of God when they are frogs in Egypt well why didn't they they tell them mystery when there is darkness is everything was okay foreign [Music] Amina let us not be the people together me who become victims of circumstances let us realize things are happening the area happening because it is what does the Bible say when we see these things what is happening what killing you got to understand to realize again that you can operate the power of that fool no cause things are so expensive there's no hunger in the house not to call the pastor not to call a brother or a sister it is time for you to lock yourself in the closet she said okay I am like that Widow Lord Jesus I have received my Elijah for the day yes we are people coming today and saying that we should remove the fivefold ministry we do not need to return to other plan I'm here amen that's right we cannot bring something that is I know I am in the message when things are happening like that you said I have received my Elijah I have given him my time I listen to the table I read the Bible dear God you know I am friends we have accepted the prophet that way according to his riches things are happening like that so that you realize your economy is not determined by the Ministry of Finance there was no witch in Israel yeah there was no witch in Israel movies there was no oil in Israel Israel where was that flower coming from him where was that flower coming from where was that oil coming from brother sister you've got to doctors you've gone to the hospital according foreign foreign you're stunning yeah yeah true he was standing Yeah Yeah from his actions you come with a very good message foreign I mean when someone says foreign but now yeah yeah that's [Music] great and I love you hey [Music] Hallelujah you see now I don't know my time is up by one okay amen the promise of the Holy ghosts and all your prayers I mean I'm actually preparing this Americano song [Music] hallelujah hallelujah it's time to start changing our statements Church you know I'm a Christian Style [Music] [Music] that is thank you you could be struggling in life foreign now perfect amen that is that [Music] [Music] the promise of God amen Hallelujah amen look at two people that really love each other a man and a woman and they're married they're staying together there will be squabbles but if they really love one another they have joining love in them they will just find themselves all right but somewhere in the middle of the knife foreign [Music] when he's speaking about done one of the messages he says Peter was preaching victory means [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] it's not that he's not preaching about repentance in Acts chapter 2. Jesus [Music] and we had the sound of the voice now directed towards of the cockroach himself [Music] foreign and I've compounded so many things there whatever I trust that the Lord shall just take it plain 19 degrees because the promises of God is [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and since [Music] maybe but you can just go and get hope you'll find that only the children has been putting capital letter is because it's only the children whose Hearts will be done it is only the children [Music] it is only the children so you are leaving this message is because you are among the children I mean the children who identify with the glory negative of the father what is the promise of Acts chapter 2. in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of sin foreign foreign and to them that are foreign preach this message we don't have the time but we would have gone through the truly never they're trying to be the same by the message of Jones when John the Baptist was preaching his work normal Jesus Christ Amina of Jesus Christ they had a certain privilege because in the message of John [Music] there are nuggets that identifies the coming of Jesus Christ foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] that identified Jesus The Book of John chapter one all right let's start from Fast bridge and they asked him and say unto him why baptize this now then oh what is thou be not that Christ foreign foreign it is oh yeah who is coming who or who coming after me is I am not worthy to unloose behold the Lamb of God um so when Jesus in his ministry fix that woman's sister when there was that paralyzed man that was brought down from the room is there had been caught in the very uh foreign [Music] but simply because they did not receive [Music] simply because their hearts have been done [Music] that is the reason why there will be against it this is that is Jesus don't just seem the way he is [Music] simply because they didn't take to his message when Jesus comes and sinks before Abraham um foreign [Music] take us back foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] subscribe thank you why don't you just reach out to him I don't know your situations [Music] foreign [Music] touch below
