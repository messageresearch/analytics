[15:11] Times praise the Lord if the devil
[15:13] thinks he will do something to upset
[15:16] us will instead ruin
[15:19] himself you know in the last year
[15:22] brother Mel brother Michel R was
[15:27] preaching
[15:31] everybody it's like the
[15:34] devil I think he must have
[15:38] regreted how many of you remember that
[15:41] you know everybody went into worship
[15:48] and even when I'm in darkness the Lord
[15:50] shall be a light unto
[15:54] me we had we had a video day that
[15:57] day the came back just screamed it all
[16:00] the Lord had done

[16:06] us and so a lot of things to coordinate
[16:09] with the with the people
[16:11] here so whatever else is not going
[16:15] well our desire and prayer is that God
[16:19] will give us our permanent place for
[16:20] these youth
[16:24] meetings I've told some a few Brothers a
[16:26] few of our close friends
[16:30] and sometimes you know some people have
[16:32] told me no that's being over
[16:36] ambitious it's not about being
[16:40] ambitious you canot be over ambitious
[16:42] about the work
[16:45] of all the men of God that went before
[16:47] us and did great things that have made
[16:49] us who we are
[16:53] today you know they had to do things
[16:56] that were was greater than them

[22:25] in
[22:26] common
[22:29] atmosphere when the people of God
[22:32] gather the Saints start to
[22:35] praise we create the

[23:06] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[23:08] be thou removed and be thou cast into
[23:10] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[23:13] but shall believe that those things
[23:14] which he had said shall come to pass he
[23:17] shall have whatsoever he
[23:26] said

[25:14] kingdom to
[25:16] [Music]
[25:21] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[25:24] for you to know the times nor the
[25:25] seasons which the father had put in his
[25:28] own
[25:34] power but ye shall receive power after
[25:38] that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and

[26:59] because we serve a living
[27:01] God we want to be a personal

[34:19] you me the
[34:21] real the real

[34:28] and if your
[34:30] experience is not the same as you as
[34:32] they had in the upper
[34:34] room new
[34:37] experience brother brandham says it this
[34:40] way I don't know if they play a lot of
[34:42] basketball
[34:44] hereas not really we bring it to
[34:51] soccer he says when people see a
[34:53] football
[34:54] game they cheer up they cheer
[34:58] but now he says if our
[35:00] Master is winning the
[35:04] fight can we can sure could do a little
[35:08] cutting up once in a while we can we can
[35:11] sure could do a little cutting up once a
[35:14] [Music]
[35:16] while you know let him
[35:21] know how we appreciate the
[35:25] victory what
[35:27] Victory the victory that he gave
[35:31] us that's right so we don't want it to
[35:34] be a dead meeting this
[35:36] afternoon that
[35:38] church we wanted to be
[35:41] alive we are not cheering our national
[35:45] team we are giving
[35:47] praise to our father to our
[35:51] god oh and as he has already won the
[35:55] victory Shout the victory victory
[35:59] is victory is mine I called Satan to get
[36:04] the
[36:10] behind hu
[36:13] amen that's the way we must think says
[36:16] the
[36:18] prophet he says we see somebody here
[36:20] being
[36:22] healed and others miss
[36:25] it saints of
[36:28] God don't miss
[36:30] it these are not just ordinary
[36:35] meetings receive your
[36:41] portion then for those who misses he
[36:43] said what what is
[36:45] it lack of
[36:47] faith because God doesn't treat his
[36:53] children one
[36:55] way and another way for somebody
[36:58] [Music]
[37:00] else God blesses the same
[37:04] way for the
[37:06] youngest to the oldest no matter where
[37:10] we come from we heard it this morning he
[37:14] love me he love
[37:17] you
[37:20] amen but we have to think his
[37:24] thoughts for the sake of time
[37:27] you can read it back home Romans
[37:32] 122 we have to be
[37:36] renewed and the prophet says when you
[37:39] begin to think his
[37:42] thoughts you will begin to live his
[37:45] life and do the things that he did you
[37:49] see what I mean not because it's it's
[37:52] not

[50:24] Bible
[50:26] that one off so we forget about
[50:31] time we're creatures of
[50:34] [Music]
[50:39] Eternity hey the Bible tells us when
[50:42] Jesus was speaking when the apostles
[50:44] were speaking you know where the power
[50:46] of God
[50:48] is you lose
[50:52] time when they came out of Egypt
[50:56] amen the power of God was there with
[50:59] them their clothes didn't wear

[51:28] never h
[51:29] [Applause]
[51:32] again amen let's take Joshua an
[51:35] example Joshua meaning
[51:38] savior he says see brother PR says in
[51:42] Victory
[51:45] Day he had the enemy all
[51:48] [Music]
[51:50] rooted
[51:52] everywhere but he had to hunt them down
[51:56] to kill
[51:58] them that's all there was to
[52:01] it because that was his
[52:07] commission so the enemy was
[52:11] everywhere but Joshua was
[52:14] commissioned just like you heard
[52:16] yesterday we are
[52:24] commissioned and the prophet
[52:26] says you better destroy your
[52:30] enemy before your enemy
[52:34] destroys you better get rid of your bad
[52:38] habits by surrendering to
[52:41] God in meetings like
[52:44] this where I surrender
[52:49] all amen Joshua
[52:51] says amen he said he knew if it was
[52:55] going to be night
[52:57] time they would have
[53:00] time to mobilize
[53:08] again to get organized
[53:11] again don't leave any chance to
[53:15] Satan
[53:18] organized brother Bram was in a
[53:21] meeting amen and he was saying because
[53:25] people were here Bound by
[53:28] demons this demon was crying to another
[53:31] person there was
[53:40] possess that in the presence of God
[53:43] nothing can
[53:45] stand your faith before
[53:51] prayer don't get let them get
[53:54] organized
[53:57] so Joshua
[53:58] said I need
[54:02] [Music]
[54:05] light what do you need Miss Jesus
[54:11] [Music]
[54:17] Christ Hallelujah
[54:19] am I need
[54:22] light son stand still
[54:26] and God listened to a man's
[54:29] word stopped the
[54:33] Sun what a paradox what a
[54:37] paradox God did it
[54:40] anyhow how by a
[54:43] man not a great angel coming down from
[54:47] heaven but a
[54:49] man with
[54:51] faith in the mission that he was
[54:54] given
[54:56] to take and possess the
[54:58] land and the word of God was behind
[55:02] it I give you this
[55:05] land I give you the open
[55:08] book that's the land of
[55:11] promise amen amen am the sun Stood
[55:16] Still the moon over
[55:22] aelon because a man a human
[55:27] being was in line of
[55:31] duty he commanded the son to stand
[55:37] still and if we are
[55:40] Christians okay let me bring it to your
[55:43] front door
[55:45] now how many confess to be real true
[55:51] Born Again
[55:54] Christians
[56:01] so if we are real
[56:04] Christians we have to
[56:09] believe the word of
[56:12] God the infallible word of
[56:16] God he stopped the
[56:19] world he stopped the
[56:22] son brother BR says ever he
[56:26] did the son stood still for 24
[56:30] [Music]
[56:31] hours and Mark 11:22
[56:36] says we read it if you say to this
[56:43] mountain said it will come to
[56:48] pass
[56:51] amen Joshua stopped the sun Joshua IM
[56:55] does that make a Superman out of
[57:00] him I'm asking you the question you know
[57:03] people like to raise up
[57:07] people brother Bram created
[57:12] squirrels does make a Superman out of
[57:15] it no sir because God chose
[57:20] vessels amen amen his work for brother
[57:23] of Malachi 4 is done here
[57:25] here but we have to continue the
[57:29] commission we have to utterly
[57:32] destroy Satan's
[57:36] kingdom by God's
[57:39] word fa in God's
[57:43] word me all things are possible With
[57:51] God all things are possible to you also
[57:55] nothing impossible to them
[57:58] that listen to what the prophet
[58:01] says I'm
[58:03] afraid that the church doesn't know
[58:06] their
[58:10] Authority I'm
[58:12] afraid that the Holy Ghost born
[58:16] man don't realize their
[58:20] Authority The Authority that God has
[58:23] permitted in his church
[58:27] that's why God came
[58:30] down to break the
[58:33] seals so we know our position in Christ
[58:37] Jesus so exercise your
[58:42] faith God have his
[58:47] way Joshua was
[58:50] promised the whole
[58:53] land
[58:56] my but here comes some big walls in
[58:59] front of
[59:05] him some big
[59:08] chains some
[59:11] big
[59:13] [Music]
[59:14] fortresses but we need to destroy
[59:18] them look at
[59:21] joshuaa before one
[59:23] rock
[59:26] ever came out of the
[59:29] building of the walls of
[59:34] Jero what was Joshua's
[59:37] [Music]
[59:43] attitude good I have your
[59:46] [Music]
[59:48] attention you know Joshua and Caleb when
[59:50] they heard you know the spies were sent
[59:53] out
[59:57] they were the only
[1:00:00] ones that didn't have a pity
[1:00:06] party they didn't have the attitude of
[1:00:12] defeat well they saw the
[1:00:15] Giants they saw the same thing as the
[1:00:18] others
[1:00:20] did but they said we are more than able
[1:00:25] because God has already spoken the
[1:00:28] word Joshua
[1:00:31] said how how can I destroy these
[1:00:37] walls you gave me the
[1:00:40] land but there's got to be a
[1:00:43] way that the land becomes
[1:00:47] mine I'm bringing up to us
[1:00:50] now there has to be a way
[1:00:55] that the seals come
[1:00:58] open the seals don't come
[1:01:02] open see our full
[1:01:08] possession our true
[1:01:10] [Music]
[1:01:14] identity while Joshua seeks the the Lord
[1:01:17] in
[1:01:20] prayer the Lord comes
[1:01:22] down he sees a man and he draws the
[1:01:27] sword are you for me or against
[1:01:31] me that's a real
[1:01:34] Soldier are you with me or against
[1:01:38] me the
[1:01:41] battlefield I'm going to destroy every
[1:01:48] demon but here he
[1:01:50] says I am the captain here
[1:01:55] I am in charge
[1:01:57] here I am going to lead
[1:02:00] you so we don't need another
[1:02:07] leader we don't need an eight
[1:02:11] person Holy Ghost will lead you in all
[1:02:14] truth the Holy Ghost will lead
[1:02:19] you
[1:02:23] amen
[1:02:25] even brother
[1:02:26] Bram needed the angel of the
[1:02:29] Lord to come
[1:02:32] down and to reveal the
[1:02:36] seals he says I would have made a
[1:02:39] horrible
[1:02:42] mistake no one is worthy to take the
[1:02:48] book only the lamb is
[1:02:53] Worthy Revelation is not brother
[1:02:55] branham's intellectual
[1:02:59] property
[1:03:03] property so many men try to point to
[1:03:08] themselves I have to follow up what
[1:03:10] brother Bram
[1:03:12] said no no no the only one we can point
[1:03:19] toist amen the original
[1:03:22] word God's Property
[1:03:26] and he Reveals His Own
[1:03:29] word God chose His
[1:03:32] Bride and he is in
[1:03:35] charge no manade
[1:03:38] system will ever make
[1:03:40] it so
[1:03:42] now we see
[1:03:45] Joshua seven Church
[1:03:48] ages walks around the walls in
[1:03:53] silence
[1:03:57] now in the seven Church
[1:04:00] age yes in
