[27:57] back home I know they're streaming the
[27:59] service and uh I believe you're going to
[28:02] have a blessed time in the book of 2
[28:04] Kings chapter 6 2 Kings chapter 6 verse
[28:09] 13-1
[28:10] 17 a very common and familiar scripture
[28:13] that we all
[28:15] know and I'm just trusting God to get
[28:19] something to speak
[28:21] on as he leads us by his
[28:23] grace 2 Kings chapter 6
[28:28] verse 13-1
[28:30] 17 and this is what the Bible says
[28:33] trusting that we are all
[28:35] there and he said go and spy where he is
[28:40] that I may send and fetch him and it was
[28:43] told him saying behold he's in Dothan
[28:49] therefore sent he Thee the horses and
[28:52] chariots and a great host and they came
[28:55] by night and compassed the city about
[28:59] and when the servant of the man of God
[29:01] was risen early and gone forth behold
[29:05] and host Compass the city both with
[29:08] horses and chariots and his servant said
[29:11] unto him alas my master how shall we do
[29:17] and he said and he answered fear not for
[29:21] they that be with us are more than they
[29:24] that be with
[29:25] them and elishah prayed and said Lord I
[29:30] pray thee open his eyes that he may see
[29:35] and the Lord opened the eyes of the
[29:37] young man and he saw and behold the
[29:40] mountain was
[29:42] full Hallelujah it was not quarter it
[29:45] was not halfway but it was full of
[29:49] horses and Chariots of Fire round about
[29:53] Elisha father in the mighty name of
[29:55] Jesus Christ you've read your word Lord
[29:57] we believe this to be your word Lord
[30:00] that proceeded out of your mouth and
[30:02] Lord here we are as little eaglets Lord
[30:05] and expectation that Lord Jesus Christ
[30:08] you will feed us your word tonight that
[30:10] Heavenly Father even as we go into
[30:12] prayer we shall rise in the Realms of
[30:14] the heavenlies oh God into that place
[30:17] where the impossible becomes possible
[30:19] father we pray that Lord you may St our
[30:21] faith tonight the Lord you shall edify
[30:23] us oh God you shall Quicken Lord Jesus
[30:26] Christ the faith of God in us that Lord
[30:28] Jesus Christ each and every one of us
[30:30] even as we go into prayer we shall be
[30:32] able father to have access even into the
[30:34] holy of holies like Esther heavenly
[30:37] father have that identification oh God
[30:40] that the scepter of the King has been
[30:42] extended unto us oh God and now we can
[30:45] approach you father we thank you and we
[30:46] appreciate you Lord by the ministration
[30:48] of your word we pray that Lord you shall
[30:50] make these things a reality and Lord
[30:52] Jesus Christ like the servant of this
[30:54] Prophet that we've just read about may
[30:56] you open our eyes to to see the Lord
[30:58] Jesus Christ on our side tonight for
[31:00] this is our prayer and we ask it in
[31:02] Jesus mighty name amen amen amen you may
[31:06] have your
[31:07] seats
[31:09] uh as I invite your
[31:12] attention to the book of Isaiah chapter
[31:16] 59: 19 to 20 and then we shall also read
[31:20] first John chapter 4:4 praise the name
[31:23] of the Lord Jesus Christ now I really
[31:25] want to ensure that I utilize and make
[31:29] uh maximum use of my time and tonight
[31:32] I'll be speaking about uh in the form of
[31:34] asking a question I want to ask you what
[31:38] do you see when you look praise the name
[31:41] of our Lord Jesus Christ what do you see
[31:44] when you
[31:45] look praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[31:48] when I
[31:49] say it is off praise the
[31:54] Lord amen now I want to speak about what
[31:56] do you you see when you look praise the
[31:59] name of the Lord Jesus Christ and I want
[32:01] to draw a distinction between looking
[32:04] and seeing praise the name of our Lord
[32:07] Jesus you can look at something and fail
[32:09] to see praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:12] Christ you can have I remember uh back
[32:15] in school there's this story book that
[32:18] we used to have and there was H someone
[32:21] that that had a pen I don't know if
[32:23] someone has a pen uh maybe someone has a
[32:26] pen quickly just just pass it to me
[32:28] kindly someone has a pen and it's
[32:30] plugged in right there in their ear and
[32:33] they're asking all around the place
[32:34] where's my pen where is my pen they're
[32:36] looking for the pen Hallelujah where is
[32:39] my pen where is my pen they're looking
[32:41] for it praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[32:43] Christ but they cannot see that they
[32:45] have the
[32:47] pen I'll be saying quite a lot so let's
[32:51] get used to it praise the Lord so have
[32:53] you ever been in a situation where
[32:55] you're looking for something
[32:57] and you're not seeing it but in real
[33:00] sense that thing is with
[33:03] you I know sometime this happen to
[33:05] mothers you can be looking for a spoon
[33:08] maybe you want to Star a pot or
[33:10] something like that and you're wondering
[33:11] where did I put that spoon why did I put
[33:13] that wooden stick and all that where
[33:15] else it's all been in your hand the
[33:17] whole time praise the name of the Lord
[33:19] Jesus so I want to show you having eyes
[33:23] does not mean that you
[33:24] see you can look at something and fail
[33:27] to see it assuming this room as we are
[33:31] in right now and all the lights are out
[33:35] your eyes can be open but in reality
[33:38] you're looking but you can't
[33:40] see praise God why can't you see simply
[33:44] because you have nothing that can enable
[33:46] you to see praise the name of our Lord
[33:48] Jesus Christ and I just want to
[33:50] draw a few illustrations here from the
[33:53] story that we've read about Elisha and
[33:55] his servant and the Bible is so clear to
[33:58] tell us that Elisha prayed to God and
[34:02] and Elisha prayed and said Lord I pray
[34:05] thee open his eyes that he may
[34:09] see the servant had his eyes open so and
[34:14] it is the opening of his eyes that made
[34:16] him realize that actually we've been
[34:19] encompassed round
[34:21] about so this man it's not that he had
[34:25] his eyes closed this man was not
[34:30] blind his eyes were actually working
[34:33] quite well his eyes were open but the
[34:36] problem is the opening of his eyes were
[34:39] only showing him that the enemies were
[34:42] round about
[34:44] him praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:46] Christ and it takes the prophet of the
[34:48] Lord to pray once again that Lord open
[34:51] his eyes that he may see so there's
[34:55] something else that had been hidden from
[34:58] the vision of this servant that when the
[35:00] prophet of God prayed this servant was
[35:03] now able to see amen praise the name of
[35:06] the Lord Jesus and I want to ask you as
[35:09] we continue when you look what do you
[35:12] see because each and every time you look
[35:15] at something there has to be something
[35:16] that you see praise the name of our Lord
[35:19] Jesus Christ maybe you've been looking
[35:21] at your life and seeing problems maybe
[35:24] you've been looking at your life and
[35:25] seeing issues you've been looking at
[35:27] your life and seeing unanswered prayers
[35:30] you've been looking at your life and
[35:32] seeing as if God has been
[35:34] delaying praise the name of our Lord
[35:36] Jesus Christ but now I pray to God that
[35:39] tonight I can pray the same prayer that
[35:43] Elisha prayed Lord may you open their
[35:46] eyes that they may
[35:50] see say because there's something else
[35:54] there's something else that you need to
[35:55] see Hallelujah it is not that what
[35:58] you're seeing is wrong as a matter of
[36:01] fact what you are seeing is actually
[36:03] true but there's another Vision that you
[36:06] need to open your eyes to
[36:10] see praise God I see Jonah one time
[36:13] having received a call from God and he
[36:16] runs away and we know the story and he's
[36:18] swallowed by a fish B when he opened his
[36:22] eyes to look what did he see on this
[36:25] side where El better
[36:27] on this side west belly right left and
[36:30] Center North South East and West all
[36:33] that he could see was nothing but W's
[36:36] belly
[36:38] Hallelujah now what I'm talking about is
[36:41] not ignorance I'm not trying to say that
[36:43] we become ignorant of what is happening
[36:45] no
[36:46] sir we are not becoming ignorant we are
[36:50] actually acknowledging that yes The Well
[36:53] of the the belly of the wh is right here
[36:56] I'm right in darkness I'm right in my
[36:59] problem I'm right in my situation but I
[37:02] want to see
[37:04] beyond the belly of the whale I want to
[37:07] see beyond my sickness I want to see
[37:09] beyond this circumstance I want to see
[37:11] beyond the problem what do I want to see
[37:14] the promise of
[37:17] God praise the name of our Lord Jesus
[37:19] Christ and Jonah was able to remember
[37:22] something that there's a Temple
[37:24] somewhere Hallelujah and as he was
[37:27] remembering his vision started changing
[37:31] Hallelujah the belly of the whale
[37:33] started
[37:34] fading this side started fading and a
[37:38] vision was being created and it was the
[37:41] vision of the
[37:42] temple Hallelujah and now you see as the
[37:46] vision of the temple is being created
[37:48] there are certain words that were coming
[37:50] to his mind oh
[37:53] my that is what we need Saints amen
[37:56] remember habakuk chapter 2 write down
[37:59] the vision at the appointed time the
[38:02] vision shall
[38:06] speak Hallelujah so he started hearing
[38:10] certain words what was it it was the
[38:12] prayer of
[38:14] Solomon that oh God if there be a child
[38:18] of thine regardless of the situation
[38:23] woo regardless of the circumstance if
[38:26] they pray to you oh God looking towards
[38:30] this Holy Temple oh God may you
[38:34] hear and you know what happened John has
[38:37] he wred in now as he was looking yes the
[38:41] belly of the H was there but he could
[38:43] see beyond the belly of the wh praise
[38:46] the name of the Lord Jesus and that is
[38:48] what I want to speak on
[38:50] tonight what do you see when you
[38:53] look look at your situation look at your
[38:56] life
[38:57] life look at your walk with God look at
[39:00] your family look at your business look
[39:03] at your
[39:04] job what do you see when you
[39:08] look Isaiah 59: 19- 20 says this so
[39:14] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[39:15] from the West and his glory from the
[39:19] rising of the Sun and when the enemy
[39:22] shall come in like a flood the spirit of
[39:25] the Lord shall shall Rift up a standard
[39:27] against
[39:29] him what do you see when you look the
[39:32] enemy coming like a flood yes I can see
[39:35] that but brother sister let me ask you
[39:38] look
[39:40] again what do you see when you look the
[39:43] Bible tells me that the spirit of God
[39:45] shall raise a
[39:47] standard are you in a situation where
[39:50] you look round about your life all you
[39:52] can see is the devil all you can see is
[39:55] the flood I want you to
[39:57] look I want you to look once again
[40:01] because the promise of God stands sure
[40:03] that the spirit of
[40:05] God shall raise up a standard and he
[40:08] says this and the spirit of God shall
[40:10] lift up a standard against him verse 20
[40:13] says and the Redeemer shall come to
[40:19] Zion how is a spirit going to be able to
[40:23] raise a standard by the Redeemer coming
[40:26] into Zion Hallelujah let's go to 1 John
[40:34] 4:4 1 John 4:4 this is what the Bible
[40:39] says ye are of God little
[40:42] children and have overcome them he's
[40:44] talking about having victory over the
[40:46] world and the things of the world and
[40:47] all those kind of things and he says ye
[40:49] are of God little children and have
[40:51] overcome them because greater is he that
[40:55] is in you than he that is in the
[41:00] world greater is he that is in you than
[41:04] he that is in the world you believe this
[41:07] thing Saints all right let's start
[41:10] preaching
[41:11] now what do you see when you look
[41:14] brother Bram tells us in several
[41:17] messages that the Gate of the soul is
[41:20] the eyes praise God many times during
[41:24] the prayer line he will tell the people
[41:26] people to ensure that they've closed
[41:28] their eyes and not look up until brother
[41:31] Bram will tell them that it's okay to
[41:33] look up praise God and he says he
[41:35] somewhere and each one of you you're
[41:37] looking your eye is the gate to your
[41:41] soul you can look at it it almost
[41:44] governs the other senses you look at it
[41:47] before you taste it you look at it
[41:50] before you smell it you look at it
[41:52] before you feel it and so forth it is
[41:55] usually the eye that is the gate to the
[41:57] soul and he says this and if you could
[42:00] only let that be a blessing to you when
[42:04] you see with your own eyes and you hear
[42:07] with your own ears the Lord Jesus moving
[42:10] among the people and doing things that
[42:13] he has been doing it should make you
[42:16] have real Faith
[42:19] then praise God you see brother branam
[42:22] is getting us to a place where we know
[42:25] these things
[42:26] that we have the body we have the spirit
[42:28] and we have the soul we know that the
[42:31] body has five inlets inlets rather has
[42:34] five senses we know the spirit has five
[42:36] as well and in the soul there's only one
[42:39] thing that can be able to stay there
[42:41] either Faith or doubt praise God and it
[42:44] tells us and these are things that we
[42:46] know that the things that happen in the
[42:48] outward have a certain impact and an
[42:52] influence and what is on the inside
[42:55] praise the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[42:56] Christ so we get to a place where we get
[42:59] to understand that it
[43:01] matters the things that we look at
[43:04] really matter it matters what we are
[43:07] watching Praise the name of the Lord
[43:09] Jesus Christ it matters the things that
[43:12] we see with our own
[43:14] eyes Brothers if all you keep on seeing
[43:16] in the office time and time again is
[43:19] half naked women you know what's going
[43:21] to
[43:22] happen sisters if all you keep on seeing
[43:25] time and time again office or at school
[43:27] women or your friends are as cantly
[43:29] dressed you know what's going to happen
[43:31] all these kind of things they rub off on
[43:33] you amen praise the name of the Lord
[43:35] Jesus no wonder brother Bram preached a
[43:38] message
[43:43] influence are we following are we
[43:47] sleepy all right so what we look at what
[43:51] we see with our own eyes matters a lot
[43:55] if you spent too much much time looking
[43:57] at M and is it called UTV and you nbtv
[44:01] or something the the television stations
[44:03] of the
[44:04] country you'll be
[44:07] influenced you'll be influenced by the
[44:09] order of the day because whatever it is
[44:11] that you're watching and seeing how this
[44:13] is happening here how this is happening
[44:15] here it influences your
[44:18] thinking praise the name of the Lord
[44:20] Jesus that is why in Philippians the
[44:22] Bible tells us if there be any praise if
[44:25] there be any VT you if there be any of
[44:27] these things think on these
[44:29] things because the things that you
[44:32] expose yourself to they influence what
[44:35] saturates your
[44:37] mind as a young person if all that you
[44:39] do from morning to evening till late in
[44:41] the night is WhatsApp and movies and
[44:45] social media and Tik toks and all these
[44:46] kind of things it influences the way you
[44:49] think it influences the way you see the
[44:52] Bible it influences the attitude that
[44:55] you have when you come to to the service
[44:57] praise the name of the Lord Jesus we can
[44:59] never really
[45:00] overemphasize on those things but it
[45:02] really matters the things that we look
[45:05] at and you see we get to a place where
[45:08] we need to realize that as an individual
[45:12] the way we are tuned as human beings
[45:15] with our physical eyes there's nothing
[45:18] good that we can be able to see praise
[45:22] God I'll tell you a story one time that
[45:24] brother Bram gave about this little boy
[45:26] boy he went to the mother and told the
[45:29] mother you know uh we've heard so much
[45:32] about God we always read about God
[45:34] during the family altar in Sunday school
[45:36] we sing songs about God I would really
[45:39] want to see this God how can I see God
[45:42] and the mother told the young boy you
[45:44] know what son that's a very hard
[45:46] question why don't you ask it to the
[45:49] Sunday school teacher that Sunday first
[45:52] thing goes to the Sunday school teacher
[45:54] Sunday school teachers you have a lot of
[45:55] of
[45:57] work because if the parents do not know
[45:59] the questions are going to come to you
[46:01] and then the Sunday school teacher says
[46:03] unfortunately I also do not know the the
[46:05] answer to that question so why don't you
[46:07] go ask the pastor so the little boy as
[46:10] faithful as he is as innocent as he is
[46:13] he goes to the pastor pastor this God
[46:16] that we keep on hearing time and time
[46:18] again you've preached about him service
[46:20] after
[46:21] service maybe even today you also
[46:23] mentioned about this God how can I see
[46:25] is
[46:26] God and then the pastor tells the young
[46:29] boy young man
[46:31] unfortunately nobody can be able to see
[46:34] God and this didn't really settle so
[46:36] well in the young boy's mind because
[46:38] it's like if this God is able to create
[46:41] the Earth the moon the stars the Sun and
[46:44] all these kind of things everything that
[46:46] we see the trees the animals he even
[46:49] created me how is it that he cannot be
[46:53] seen I hope you understand the the the
[46:55] insiration of this young boy and then
[46:58] one time as they had gone fishing with a
[47:00] little old fisherman and there was a
[47:02] rainbow that appeared somewhere I'll try
[47:04] to paraphrase the
[47:06] story and he the the the the young man
[47:10] asked the fisherman that question and
[47:12] the fisherman turned to the young boy
[47:13] with tears in his eyes and told him
[47:16] young boy all I've been seeing my entire
[47:20] life has been nothing but God
[47:24] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[47:26] Jesus he says when I look at the rainbow
[47:29] I see God when I look at the ocean I see
[47:32] God when I look at the birds I see God
[47:35] and brother Bram says the thing that
[47:37] happened with this old fisherman was
[47:40] simply because he had more of God in him
[47:43] until he could be able to see God on the
[47:48] outside praise the name of the Lord
[47:50] Jesus and that is a place where we
[47:52] really make a mistake many of times we
[47:54] don't have more of of God on the inside
[47:57] and you expect to see God on the outside
[47:59] Young Brother young sister it doesn't
[48:02] work that
[48:03] way if you want to see God on the
[48:05] outside you need to have God on the
[48:07] inside so that the God on the inside can
[48:10] be able to look at things using your
[48:13] eyes remember what brother Brenham says
[48:16] he has no hands but your hands he has no
[48:19] feet but your feet he has no mouth but
[48:22] your mouth he has no eyes but your eyes
[48:27] praise God and you know one thing about
[48:29] God if God is using your eyes the only
[48:34] thing that God is going to see is just
[48:36] one thing he's going to see his
[48:40] word praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[48:42] we have a message God has not changed
[48:44] his mind about his word praise the name
[48:48] of the Lord Jesus and you know that this
[48:50] word is the only thing that is going to
[48:52] stand the test of time Heaven and Earth
[48:56] will pass away praise the name of the
[48:58] Lord Jesus Christ but the word of God
[49:01] will remain I want to ask your a
[49:03] question brother sister are you a part
[49:06] of that word yes sir
[49:09] Hallelujah we might be so quick to say
[49:12] that heaven and earth will pass away but
[49:15] do you know that scripture also applies
[49:18] to
[49:19] you because you are a part of that word
[49:23] so sickness will pass away sorrow will
[49:26] pass away Peril will pass away but I
[49:30] will remain why I am a part of that
[49:37] word but how can you be able to see
[49:39] these things if God is looking at these
[49:42] things from in
[49:45] us we miss out a lot of things simply
[49:48] because when we look we do not
[49:51] see praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[49:53] Christ but I want to thank God for
[49:55] something here because you see in this
[49:59] last age there is something that was
[50:03] connected between sight and the ludian
[50:07] churches praise the name of the Lord
[50:08] Jesus Revelation 3:1 17-18 says this
[50:12] because thou sayest I am rich and
[50:14] increased with goods and have need of
[50:16] nothing and knowest not that thou art
[50:20] wretched and miserable and poor and
[50:24] blind and naked
[50:26] yeah for sure we have some the naked
[50:28] part they've really fulfilled it so
[50:30] well in the spiritual and in the
[50:33] physical but in the physical in terms of
[50:37] blindness not so much isn't that
[50:39] true I mean how many are there in
[50:42] churches today but are not physically
[50:44] blind but they're spiritually blind
[50:47] right but you see the Bible identifies
[50:51] that those in the ludian church age are
[50:53] going to be blind and he continues to
[50:56] say Verse 18 I canel Thee to buy of me
[51:00] gold tried in the fire that thou may be
[51:03] rich and white rment that thou may be
[51:06] clothed and that the shame of thy
[51:08] nakedness do not appear and anoint thine
[51:12] eyes with eyes s that thou mayest
[51:17] see hallelujah praise God so the promise
[51:22] for this last Church age is that there
[51:25] shall people that will receive eyes
[51:27] myself when others are walking in
[51:30] blindness there are some that will
[51:32] receive their
[51:34] sight Hallelujah why are we receiving
[51:37] our sight let me ask that why are we
[51:39] receiving our sight you see we are
[51:42] receiving our sight simply
[51:44] because God and the way God does things
[51:48] remember we want to see God right amen
[51:51] and the only way we can see God Is by
[51:54] having him on the inside
[51:56] so if our eyesight needs to be corrected
[52:00] so that we can have God on the inside
[52:02] then God also needs to work on the
[52:05] inside and that's the reason why God was
[52:08] very very particular in that in this
[52:11] last Church age he sent us a messenger
[52:14] to the
[52:15] heart praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[52:17] Christ Malachi 4: 5 and six this is a
[52:21] messenger that is there to deal with the
[52:25] heart
[52:27] specifically and he shall turn the heart
[52:30] of the children back to the fathers so
[52:34] why is it that there's a messenger who
[52:37] is dealing with the heart Matthew
[52:39] chapter
[52:43] 5:8 Matthew
[52:50] 5:8 we see one of the things that
[52:53] happened when Jesus came in the first
[52:55] coming
[52:56] they missed him so much in that Jesus
[52:59] was standing right before them but when
[53:02] they looked at Jesus they were seeing
[53:04] the son of a
[53:06] carpenter they were seeing just a young
[53:08] boy who's unrule in the
[53:11] society praise the name of the Lord
[53:13] Jesus Christ that was born out of
[53:15] wedlock but this was the Messiah so what
[53:18] was the problem the problem was John the
[53:21] Baptist came with a message to their
[53:24] heart but their heart was not
[53:26] turned but to them that their hearts
[53:29] were turned Hallelujah when Jesus came
[53:34] and John the Baptist said Behold the
[53:36] Lamb of God because their heart was
[53:39] turned when they turned they saw
[53:42] Jesus praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[53:45] Matthew 5:8 blessed are the pure in
[53:50] heart
[53:53] for I want you to say H for they shall
[53:56] do
[53:58] what blessed are the pure in heart so
[54:01] that's why God had to send a messenger
[54:04] to the heart to deal with your heart to
[54:07] deal with my heart to condition us and
[54:10] put us in a place where you and I shall
[54:13] see
[54:15] God
[54:17] hallelujah remember we are not being
[54:19] ignorant we are not being oblivious of
[54:22] challenges we are not being oblivious of
[54:24] problems
[54:25] we are not being oblivious of situations
[54:28] that will arise no sir yes we understand
[54:31] all these things are there but at the
[54:34] end of the day I want to see something
[54:36] beyond my problems I want to see
[54:39] something beyond my issues I want to see
[54:41] something beyond my failures I want to
[54:43] see something beyond all these things
[54:46] what do I want to see I want to see
[54:49] Jesus praise the name of our Lord Jesus
[54:52] Christ so remember now we want to get
[54:55] him on the inside right and brother Bram
[54:58] says something here gives an analogy
[55:01] this is the message looking at the
[55:03] Unseen and says paragraph
[55:08] 62 says here and when you people here
[55:11] tonight that is sinful in your heart I
[55:15] don't mean that you live in adultery I
[55:17] don't mean that you get drunk I mean sin
[55:20] is unbelief and with unbelief in your
[55:23] heart if you just open up your heart
[55:27] once again he's dealing with the heart
[55:29] so the issue is with the heart if you
[55:32] just open up your heart and close your
[55:34] eyes and look at the chief Captain who's
[55:37] only presentent tonight the world will
[55:40] lay at your feet and it will shake every
[55:43] F of sin away from you and the doubting
[55:46] days will be over oh blessed be the name
[55:50] of the Lord and he says this I'm told
[55:52] that a snake can catch the Earth eye of
[55:55] a
[55:57] bir and charm that bir with its
[56:00] enchantment it eyes until such a way if
[56:04] that bir will give the snake its
[56:07] attention for just a few
[56:13] minutes that bird will flatter and
[56:16] completely become
[56:19] paralyzed Hallelujah and the snake will
[56:23] take the B
[56:26] so let's pause right there then I can
[56:28] ask another question again what are you
[56:30] giving your attention
[56:32] to because what you're giving your
[56:34] attention to blessed be the name of the
[56:37] Lord Jesus is charming you praise the
[56:41] name of the Lord Jesus and you see all
[56:44] this is a trap and he says and I can
[56:45] believe that because that I know of
[56:48] another serent the devil that if he can
[56:51] ever catch the eye with his enchantments
[56:55] with your modern rock and
[56:57] roll and all your fangles of the world
[57:01] if he can ever catch you young lady or
[57:04] young man just long enough to get his
[57:08] charm in on you you will flatter but you
[57:11] can't get
[57:14] loose this is the reason why we cannot
[57:16] be able to press through even in prayer
[57:20] you get to a place you're supposed to
[57:21] pray for 1 hour you pray for 2 3 minutes
[57:24] you your prayers are already over you
[57:26] start listening to your neighbor's
[57:30] prayer why because your attention is
[57:34] elsewhere you've given yourself to
[57:36] something else praise the name of the
[57:38] Lord Jesus but we need to get to a place
[57:41] where you should be pushing the pastors
[57:44] and the trustees so that you can get
[57:46] your own permanent place because you do
[57:48] not want to come off the
[57:52] altar you get to a place youve only
[57:55] prayed for 5 minutes the neighbor you
[57:57] the person you're seated next to you
[57:59] start saying Amen to their
[58:05] prayer your attention
[58:09] is because he stands staring but if he
[58:13] will take his eyes from the
[58:16] serpent you know let me tell you
[58:18] something Sint our Prophet was
[58:21] inspired he did not say if he takes his
[58:23] eyes from the SA
[58:25] and look sideways woo he says and look
[58:29] upward why are you looking upward
[58:32] because you're looking away to
[58:34] Jesus David said I look up to the
[58:37] heavens where does my help come from my
[58:41] help come from the
[58:44] Lord and maybe there could be something
[58:46] that you might have gotten yourself
[58:48] entangled into in the course of the week
[58:50] or since the year started and he says
[58:53] but if he will take his eyes from the
[58:55] serpent but if you will take your eyes
[58:57] off of that thing and look upward and
[59:01] flatter his wings he will fly Plum out
[59:04] of the reach of the
[59:07] snake praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[59:10] and if you ever got the charm of the
[59:11] world and the things of the world and
[59:14] unbelief Charming around your heart that
[59:17] tells you oh live more
[59:21] than oh live like this
[59:25] you can live like your friends it's okay
[59:27] you can live like your you know you can
[59:28] live like your buddies that's the
[59:31] Charming voice of the
[59:33] serent shake your head
[59:35] tonight and look up to the Unseen one
[59:38] the Lord Jesus Christ and flatter your
[59:40] wings of
[59:43] prayer I believe that is why we here to
[59:46] flatter our wings of prayer you remember
[59:49] the story of the little iglet as he was
[59:52] stretching his his little wings
[59:55] remember this Eagle canot flown for such
[59:58] a long time and remember when you stay
[1:00:01] without exercising yourself in prayer
[1:00:04] the muscles cramp up when you fail to
[1:00:07] exercise yourself in the spiritual walk
[1:00:10] your spiritual muscles get cramped up
[1:00:14] praise the name of the Lord Jesus but
[1:00:16] why do we come to services such as this
[1:00:17] one so that we can flat our wings in
[1:00:20] prayer so that like eagles you can
[1:00:23] stretch this wing
[1:00:25] you can stretch this wing and by faith
[1:00:28] as you're looking up oh my how does
[1:00:32] brother Branham say it that what happens
[1:00:35] when the storm comes Hallelujah are you
[1:00:38] facing storms in your life are you
[1:00:41] facing problems in your life that does
[1:00:43] not deter the ego from
[1:00:46] flying Hallelujah it actually acts as an
[1:00:50] opportunity because the ego knows I was
[1:00:53] made for this
[1:00:56] I was made for this brother sister that
[1:01:00] is why the Bible tells us that you
[1:01:02] should rejoice when you're going through
[1:01:04] trials and
[1:01:07] temptations it is simply because my amen
[1:01:11] we've got to
[1:01:12] prove we've got to prove right we've got
[1:01:16] to prove that we came from God and are
[1:01:19] going back to God we've got to prove
[1:01:22] that we've got the blood of our father
[1:01:25] us who's ever done a blood test
[1:01:30] here there's a reason why it is called a
[1:01:34] blood
[1:01:36] test and after the test you get
[1:01:39] results in this walk of Faith you must
[1:01:43] also go through a
[1:01:45] test so that you can prove that your
[1:01:48] blood is that of
[1:01:50] God and after the test you get results
[1:01:54] and the results that you get Faith of
[1:01:57] his faith virtue of his virtue knowledge
[1:02:00] of his knowledge Temperance of his
[1:02:02] Temperance all the
[1:02:05] way praise
[1:02:08] God since this is a time it's not time
[1:02:11] to Slumber but it's time to rise on the
[1:02:15] wings of Faith regardless of the
[1:02:17] challenge regardless of the trial
[1:02:20] regardless of the storm it is time for
[1:02:23] you now to stretch your wing the Old
[1:02:26] Testament the New Testament and tell God
[1:02:30] I am taking you at your
[1:02:32] word
[1:02:34] hallelujah and you see when that storm
[1:02:36] comes all that ego needs to do is just
[1:02:40] let lose its wings and there's a song
[1:02:42] that says set your wings to The Winds of
[1:02:47] Faith amen
[1:02:49] hallelujah Saints this is a walk of
[1:02:52] Faith this site that we talking about
[1:02:54] about we could have read it by because
[1:02:56] of time allow me to paraphrase it is a
[1:02:58] walk of Faith why because the just shall
[1:03:02] live by faith we do not walk by sight
[1:03:06] but we walk by faith because it's only
[1:03:10] faith that overcomes the world praise

[1:05:44] Hallelujah if God could just get a hold
[1:05:46] of you long enough brother don't you

[1:05:49] worldliness out of you don't you think

[1:05:53] power

[1:05:55] you perfect Faith don't you think he can
[1:05:58] be able to give you perfect love don't
[1:06:00] you think he can be able to give you
[1:06:01] they deserve your
[1:06:04] heart oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:06:07] Jesus and he says
[1:06:09] this remember this time that
[1:06:12] Peter Jesus was working on on water this
[1:06:16] time and they saw him from the boat and
[1:06:20] they were getting afraid and Jesus spoke
[1:06:22] unto them the same words that we saw
[1:06:25] Elisha speaking here fear not be Not
[1:06:28] Afraid in his eye and then Peter tells
[1:06:31] the Lord that if it is you let me come
[1:06:33] on the water and Peter stepped on the
[1:06:36] water and he came out of the sheep and
[1:06:38] stepped on the water and for quite some
[1:06:40] time he's able to walk well but then
[1:06:43] says in Matthew 14:29 and he said come
[1:06:47] and when Peter was come down out of the
[1:06:48] ship he walked on the water to go to
[1:06:52] Jesus but when he saw the wind
[1:06:57] boisterous when he came out of the ship
[1:07:00] he was looking at
[1:07:01] Jesus when he came out of the ship his
[1:07:04] eyes were on Jesus but somewhere along
[1:07:07] the way he saw what was happening on the
[1:07:10] other side he saw that the winds were so
[1:07:14] strong you'd guard your eyes on that
[1:07:16] promise for so long you'd had your eyes
[1:07:19] on a certain scripture for so long and
[1:07:21] you praying that God May fulfill it in
[1:07:23] your life but there came a point in time
[1:07:25] and you looked at this side and maybe
[1:07:27] you looked at that side you stopped
[1:07:29] looking at the promise of
[1:07:31] God this is what happened to Peter and
[1:07:34] he said he was
[1:07:36] afraid and beginning to sink he cried
[1:07:41] saying Lord save
[1:07:44] me one thing I love about Peter
[1:07:47] is when he looked away and he started
[1:07:50] sinking he realized something and I can
[1:07:54] imagine maybe his
[1:07:56] mind went back a couple of months ago
[1:07:59] when they were somewhere on a ship and
[1:08:00] they were all about to sink and the
[1:08:02] storms were so much and they had tried
[1:08:05] everything that they could you know they
[1:08:06] were professional fishermen trying to
[1:08:08] get the water out of the boat all their
[1:08:10] life skills and uh how they called maybe
[1:08:13] they they had been trained uh to to to
[1:08:15] to survive on the sea during the storm
[1:08:17] and all those things and they had done
[1:08:19] all that they could but suddenly they
[1:08:22] remembered Jesus is on the
[1:08:24] ship and maybe at this time Peter
[1:08:27] happened to remember you see right now
[1:08:29] I'm sinking and I've looked away and
[1:08:32] maybe I can try and struggle and see if
[1:08:34] I can swim but he happen to remember all
[1:08:37] my toiling is in vain all my labor is in
[1:08:41] vain why all I need to do is call unto
[1:08:46] Jesus give me a man give me a woman that
[1:08:50] has had
[1:08:51] experience that when they call on Jesus
[1:08:54] Jesus always comes give me a sister that
[1:08:58] one time the child was sick maybe the
[1:09:01] husband was not there or maybe the
[1:09:02] husband was fast asleep and they called
[1:09:04] on Jesus Oh
[1:09:06] myall and Jesus answered the prayer give
[1:09:10] me a brother give me a young man that
[1:09:13] faced a certain situation there was
[1:09:15] nobody around there was no Deacon to
[1:09:18] watch but they called on Jesus and Jesus
[1:09:21] came regardless of whatever happened
[1:09:24] Jesus is always there but many of times
[1:09:28] we toil we struggle we try to do this we
[1:09:32] try to do this without realizing all
[1:09:35] that we need to do is awaken Jesus
[1:09:40] hallu praise God praise
[1:09:43] God and you see this is what the message
[1:09:45] is doing for our Saints it's opening our
[1:09:48] eyes so that we can be able to see that
[1:09:51] Jesus is right here with us
[1:09:55] praise the name of the Lord Jesus that
[1:09:57] that same Angel of the Lord that was
[1:09:59] with Moses and came to Joshua and told
[1:10:02] Joshua as I was with Moses so shall I be
[1:10:06] as I was with brother Bram so am I with
[1:10:09] you here
[1:10:12] tonight if only you can see brother if
[1:10:16] only you can see sister he is
[1:10:22] here what is the purpose of brother
[1:10:25] brandham coming it was to declare that
[1:10:28] he is here that's right yes sir but you
[1:10:34] see many times we fail to realize that
[1:10:37] he's here we end up struggling we end up
[1:10:41] toiling we end up coming to a prayer
[1:10:43] service as this and we feel that it's
[1:10:45] just a formality brother sister go
[1:10:48] beyond that formality
[1:10:51] prayer go beyond that Casual Friday
[1:10:55] evening service kind of prayer
[1:10:57] setup and me it with God tonight because
[1:11:00] God is right here to meet with your need
[1:11:03] hallelujah praise the name of the Lord
[1:11:05] Jesus and here they are Jesus had died
[1:11:09] he had resurrected as the scriptures had
[1:11:12] foretold and the Bible tells us I
[1:11:15] believe it should be somewhere in
[1:11:20] Luke this was cleopas and his friends
[1:11:24] Luke chapter
[1:11:26] 24 and the Bible says this and it came
[1:11:29] to pass that while they communed
[1:11:32] together and
[1:11:33] reasoned Jesus
[1:11:39] himself oh that scripture is not up
[1:11:41] there Luke 24:15 and it came to pass
[1:11:44] that while they commune together and
[1:11:46] reason the Bible says Jesus himself Drew
[1:11:52] near
[1:11:54] not another Jesus but Jesus himself and
[1:11:56] he says
[1:11:57] this but their eyes were Holden that
[1:12:01] they should not know him if you continue
[1:12:05] reading somewhere down there they even
[1:12:07] say that one of them responded to Jesus
[1:12:10] asking Jesus where are you the only
[1:12:12] Stranger in
[1:12:16] Jerusalem but who is this who is this
[1:12:19] Jesus
[1:12:22] himself
[1:12:25] see this these little broken words that
[1:12:28] you're hearing tonight do you know who
[1:12:30] it is Jesus
[1:12:35] himself praise the name of the Lord
[1:12:38] Jesus but you see we get to a place
[1:12:40] where and as the Bible says Their Eyes
[1:12:44] Were Holden that they may not see him
[1:12:47] but then the scriptures continue to tell
[1:12:49] us they got to this place they got to
[1:12:51] the house and Jesus broke the bread
[1:12:54] amen
[1:12:55] hallelujah and the Bible says that when
[1:12:58] he broke the bread their eyes were
[1:13:00] opened and they knew him I want to ask
[1:13:03] you something do you know how it is that
[1:13:07] they knew
[1:13:09] him it's not that Jesus snapped his
[1:13:12] fingers no
[1:13:14] sir Jesus did something that they had
[1:13:18] seen him doing
[1:13:22] beforeall
[1:13:24] says this is what we need to get to be a
[1:13:27] people that have experiences with
[1:13:33] God in a certain situation in a prayer
[1:13:37] service such as
[1:13:38] this you can be seated as you're
[1:13:41] seated and you can feel something in
[1:13:44] your body some or rather something in
[1:13:45] your spirit and you'll say the presence
[1:13:48] of the Lord is right here with me right
[1:13:51] and this is going Beyond motion now this
[1:13:55] is going to a specific way that God
[1:13:58] deals with you as an
[1:14:00] individual praise the name of the Lord
[1:14:02] Jesus because remember they had been
[1:14:05] with Jesus before he was crucified and
[1:14:09] the way Jesus broke bread at that time
[1:14:11] they knew so when they met with Jesus
[1:14:15] and oh my
[1:14:17] Hallelujah we sing this song that uh you
[1:14:21] know uh God came in uh God condescended
[1:14:24] in flesh I can't remember the the the
[1:14:26] lyrics of the song but I know some of
[1:14:28] you know it and there's a place that
[1:14:29] says and the bride
[1:14:32] herself takes the word itself and
[1:14:35] reveals herself in the Bible right but
[1:14:38] at this particular place the word
[1:14:41] himself took the word and revealed
[1:14:45] himself in the very
[1:14:48] scriptures hallelujah praise the name of
[1:14:50] the Lord Jesus the word himself taking
[1:14:53] the word itself and revealing himself in
[1:14:57] itself because the Bible says he went
[1:15:00] back to the prophets he went back to
[1:15:02] Moses and spoke to them what they have
[1:15:05] spoken concerning
[1:15:07] him what was Jesus doing he was giving
[1:15:11] them the word so that they can be able
[1:15:13] to identify who Jesus
[1:15:18] is walk with me now we get to another
[1:15:21] place where we see Fe Philip Hallelujah
[1:15:25] writing together with that Ethiopian
[1:15:26] unoch and the Ethiopian unoch is reading
[1:15:29] the
[1:15:30] Bible Hallelujah and the Ethiopian un
[1:15:33] asks of whom speaketh the prophetes of
[1:15:38] himself or another praise the name of
[1:15:41] the Lord Jesus so the man didn't know
[1:15:43] but the Bible says that philli a man
[1:15:46] full of the Holy Ghost open his mouth
[1:15:50] and right there preach Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] praise the name of the Lord Jesus but
[1:15:56] now we getting to a place where we want
[1:15:58] to look in the Bible and see Jesus but
[1:16:01] we see the only way we can see Jesus is
[1:16:05] if Jesus is on the inside of
[1:16:08] us because if Jesus is not on the inside
[1:16:11] of us we will not be able to identify
[1:16:15] him let me give this quot as we get
[1:16:18] ready to stand up on our feet in
[1:16:22] prayer and he says
[1:16:29] this and
[1:16:31] tonight uh what was

[1:22:11] believe uh to believe his word and
[1:22:14] that's the way God arms let's go up
[1:22:17] that's what he gave Eve to arm herself
[1:22:19] with and she broke her armor down
[1:22:23] how did she do it by opening up her mind
[1:22:27] to
[1:22:28] reason you see how the devil come Saints
[1:22:32] he came to
[1:22:33] Jesus the same way he came to Eve he
[1:22:37] came to Eve and told Eve
[1:22:40] if you know the reason why you were told
[1:22:42] not to eat this fruit is because God
[1:22:45] knows you will become like him but you
[1:22:49] know something Eve could have just given
[1:22:52] a very simple
[1:22:53] answer but Mr serpent I am already like
[1:22:59] God the devil does something and you
[1:23:02] need to understand this he plants a seed
[1:23:04] of doubt he wants you to doubt who you
[1:23:07] are and that is why he came to Jesus and
[1:23:09] said if you are the Son of
[1:23:13] God but Jesus does not have anything to
[1:23:16] do to prove to the devil and the bride
[1:23:19] tonight has nothing to prove to the
[1:23:21] devil amen if if you are the bride you
[1:23:25] will be doing this if you are the bride
[1:23:28] devil I'm already the
[1:23:31] bride it's not about what you're going
[1:23:33] to tell me it is what about he has
[1:23:36] already told me and according to what
[1:23:39] he's already told me he has told me that
[1:23:42] greater is he that is in me than he who
[1:23:45] is in the
[1:23:46] world he's already told me that when you
[1:23:49] come in like a flood his spirit shall
[1:23:52] raise up a
[1:23:55] standard Saints we do not need anything
[1:23:57] else we already have all what we
[1:24:01] need all we need is to ask God to open
[1:24:03] our
[1:24:04] eyes Hallelujah to see what he sees us
[1:24:08] in his word and the moment we receive
[1:24:11] that Revelation oh let's finish this and
