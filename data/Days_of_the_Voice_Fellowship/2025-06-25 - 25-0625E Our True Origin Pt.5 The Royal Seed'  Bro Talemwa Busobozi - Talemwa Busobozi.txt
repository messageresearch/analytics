You've not come here for somebody else. You come here for him and for you, Lord Jesus. Oh, here I am to worship you, Lord. Here I am to say that you are wonderful to me, Lord. Lord Jesus, I come to you, Lord, through the door of the blood. Lord, a blood which is worthy, oh God, to wash and cleanse us of every sin. Lord, we desire that you will come down this evening. Lord, and speak to each individual, Lord Jesus. Bring us into a place, oh God, where we can say that we are in fellowship with you. [Music] We worship you, Jesus. We glorify your holy name, Lord. Here we are, Lord. to say you are lovely, you are wonderful. We glorify your holy name. We thank you so much because of your love that you have bestowed towards us, Father. Lord, even as we will go in your word this evening, Lord, we ask that you'll come and take the pages of this holy word as we read in the Bible. Give us inspiration, Lord God. Speak to each of us through the these holy words, Lord, these words that have been long preserved over many, many ages, Lord, and Lord, I know that they will cause life even to us. May it be so upon us, Father, as we give the service now to you, the preaching of the word to you and the souls, Lord, that are all connected to this service, both here physically and online, Lord, whosoever that will hear what we are going to share tonight. Father, I pray that you will impact their life. We bless your name as we ask these uh blessings in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you saints. Uh we just want to go to our Bibles. Uh I I know that many are used. I noticed that uh we have been used to I was just speaking with the song leaders on our Wednesday service was being dragged to almost uh the preaching beginning almost 10 minutes past 7 or so. And you can see that uh even those that used to really rush and come on time, they thought that uh they can always come later. So we just want to go back to our normal times so that by eight sharp we just dismissing you. That's our desire. Amen. So don't come late next Wednesday thinking the service will begin late. We'll begin on time and end on time. Amen. Amen. All right. So, um just wanted to first of all greet the saints at uh evening light brighter evening brighter. We are also streaming this on Zoom tonight with them. So uh while while it is our evening service here at DVF. So just pray for me that whatever you need here and even those on YouTube whatever they need and the saints at evening light on Zoom evening that the Lord will supply. Amen. So we are reading uh thank you musicians. God bless you. Genesis chapter 22 22. Since we have 1 hour, I just want us to delve in right quick. [Music] Um, vers 15. Really, we always say 1 hour, but with interpretation, it is like 40 minutes or less. [Music] Yeah. Yes. All right. So, vers 15 to vers 18. How many love the Lord this evening? Amen. Amen. And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, sayaeth the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thy only son, that in blessing I'll bless thee, and in multiplying I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the seashore, and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice. [Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. You may be seated. So this evening we're just going to part five of our true origin. I don't know media department is it part five but we are speaking on the subject of the royal seed this evening the royal seed so here we we all know this promise that God gave to Abraham and if you give me your undivided attention because we're just going to go straight into the word He says that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven. Amen. Now this is God's promise to Abraham. So he says, "I will bless you and I'll multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the seashore." And then he continues and says, "And thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed. Now I want you to notice that here he was not referring to the natural seed Isaac. He was referring to the spiritual seed Jesus. Jesus supernatural seed, the spiritual seed in Jehovah Gyra Bam says, "Now Abraham, the promise was made to Abraham. [Music] and his seed after him. Not only Abraham, but his seed. Amen. But his seed. Now the seed, natural seed of Abraham was Isaac. The natural seed of Abraham was Isaac. But the spiritual seed of Abraham's faith was Christ. So not through Isaac all the world was blessed. But through Christ the royal seed all the world was for he died for all people. He died for all nations and all peoples. Have you got it? So the seed that he's talking of here when he says that uh and your seed shall possess the gate of his enemy and in your seed shall the nations of the earth be blessed. He's not talking about the natural seed. He's talking about the royal seed, the spiritual seed. The whole earth was not blessed through Isaac, but the whole earth was blessed through Christ. So Christ is that royal seed of Abraham. Christ is the spiritual seed of Abraham. So that's why when Jesus came to earth when he was born the Pharisees did not understand who he was because the Pharisees you remember when we were studying this study um this subject we we we read scripture in John and we we saw that discourse between Jesus and the Pharisees how they kept on exchanging words and the Pharisees kept on the Jews, they kept on claiming that they were the seed of Abraham. And Jesus said, "No, Abraham cannot be your father." Because if Abraham was your father, you would have received me because Abraham received me and Abraham rejoice to see my day. And he was glad. And he said before Abraham was before Abraham was I am. And they were offended when he spoke those words because they failed to understand that this Jesus was not talking about the natural his natural lineage. Actually his natural lineage did not matter. His natural lineage did not matter. What mattered was his spiritual lineage. Friends, I want to tell you your natural lineage also does not matter. What matters is your spiritual lineage. What is your connection with your father? I'm not talking about the natural father. Amen. The natural father, you know, may be from one tribe and have, you know, many things out of that tribe. You might have a lot of problems through that tribe. But I tell you, we have another lineage. It's a spiritual lineage. Every child of God that came from God is a part of that lineage. And our true origin is not from our physical natural lineage. Our true origin is not from an island in or somewhere in somewhere in somewhere in Toro. Are you following me? That's not where our true lineage is from. Naturally, we came from there. But really, our natural lineage does not matter because it dies and ends. It has a a beginning and it has an end. But our spiritual image, it has no beginning. It has no end. And that's why Jesus said, "Do not fear those who can kill the flesh, but fear him who has power over your flesh and over your soul." But and you know where we came from. We have no beginning of days. We have no end of days. And so was Jesus. He was promised that he would come. He was a promised seed and he came for a specific duty and he had to fulfill that duty. The devil by the way when you think about these things you feel encouraged. The devil could not stop the duty which he had come to a fight him. But there was a promise that he would possess every game of his enemies. So the devil could try but he could not hinder him. He could not defeat him. He could not stop him. That was our savior Jesus Christ. He was the spiritual royal seed of Abra. Now let's let's take um a scripture here in Matthew. Matthew chapter 1 vers 1. Um there are many verses we can look at there. I just want you to focus here with me and and and let's follow this book of the generation of Jesus Christ. Amen. Are you following here? Now, Matthew is beginning by uh you know with this term the the book of the generation of Jesus Christ. You know in Uganda when they tell you walk like a Uganda it means you you have to give your generations you. Who is your father? Who was his father? Who was his father? Who was his father? Until we reach the last last one. So now here when we begin looking at the generations of Jesus Christ, the Bible now begins, he says Jesus, he begins wi with David and he says the son of David, the son of Abraham. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. Now you you there are many things we can talk about but when you see that now from there he goes on to say Abraham begott Isaac and Isaac begot Jacob and Jacob begot Judas and his brethren and then from there he will go from Judas to Farz to Zah to to to and and you know he will go to Es to to Aram and and you will all the generations and I want us to just because of time to go down um on vers uh 15. Okay, I hope you're following me and I would begot [Music] and begott and m begot Jacob and Jacob begot Joseph. Amen. Jacob begot Joseph and Joseph the husband of Mary. Now when we oh praise the name of the Lord when he's just about to reach where or how Jesus comes into view all those other ones up. He was mentioning a man a man from whom the seed came from. you know so and so begott so and so so and so beg and so and so but now when he reached on the portion which speaks of Christ then he says and Jacob begot Joseph Joseph the husband of Mary whom of whom was born Jesus [Music] who is called Christ. So who begott who there Can we say it is Joseph? No. Is not Joseph. Jesus here was the seed of the woman but not of Joseph. Follow me closely. You see in the book of of Genesis there was also another promise which was given. You see this is the one when when we talk about Christ being the royal seed of Abraham. It was of him that the prophecies were fulfilled. A prophecy which said the seed of the woman will brea the head of the serpent. So who was that one? That was Jesus. Who was he? He was the seed of the woman. We know that a woman has no seed. So what does this mean? It simply means a child that is born by a woman without the help of a man. Are you following me now? Praise the name of the Lord. Go to Genesis and get get let's let's get it there right now. Praise the name of the Lord. You know the Bible is very amazing and if you get a mystery of the word you just love studying the scriptures. Look at Genesis 3 vers one. Now the serpent was uh where we can read go down on to um all right this is chapter 3 uh okay and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou okay uhhuh vers uh 15 can begin from vers 14 together and the Lord God said unto the serpent Because thou hast done this, thou at cast above all cattle, and above every beast of the field, and upon thy bail shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life, and I'll put enemity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed, and her seed. So the serpent had a sin and a woman had a would have a sin. This here was prophetic. Are you following me? He was speaking of the future. And he says, I will put enemity between thee and the woman and thy seed. Meaning the serpent seed, which means the serpent had a seed. Even today we still have serpent seed the world those who deny that they just don't understand the scripture and between her seed and between thy seed and it shall bruise thy head who the seed of the woman will bruise the serpent's Hallelujah. And thou shalt bruise his heel. So the serpet will bruise the heel of of the seed of the woman. But the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the serpent. This was a prophecy. It had to come to pass. Praise the name of the Lord. So now we see the seed of Abraham that was promised to come. Amen. According to prophecy, it would possess the gut of his enemies. Amen. And also all the nations of the earth would be blessed through the sea. Are you following me now? But now when we track down to find out where is this seed, that amen of Abraham that the whole world has been blessed through. We found out it is not Isaac. No, that is a natural seed of God. But Abraham had another seed, a spiritual seed. Amen. Amen. How was the Oh, praise the name of the Lord. How was the spiritual seed of Abraham born? by faith. Be it unto me according to your word. You remember when Mary said those words. Amen. And Abraham. We know we not see the Bible says in the book of generation of Jesus Christ the son of David. The son of Abraham. So the Bible actually calls Jesus the son of Abra. Are you following me? So we see that the seed of Abraham would possess the gate of of the enemy and the seed of the woman would bruise the head of the son. That's the same same thing he's speaking about. Jesus was the seed of the woman without a man. He did not need the instrumentality of a man for him to be born. When he reached the birth of Jesus, he said, "Jacob begott Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ." So, who was the father of Jesus? Certainly not Joseph. So, who is your father? Certainly not your biological father. Your biological father gives birth to this. But you see you yourself, you are not flesh and blood. You are more than flesh and blood. Amen. And your father, Amen, is the same father that begot Jesus. If that same spirit, Amen. The Lord's Christ from today dwell in you, it will quicken your mortal body. Amen. How? By the word. Amen. When we hear the word and the spirit of God comes upon us and begins to quicken us. And I tell you friends, one of these days, amen, we're going to be so quickened that we will drop these bodies and put on another body. Amen. That's what the rapture is. Amen. We have to go beyond the revelation we have now and walk into another dimension. Amen. Now let us look at this natural seed versus a supernatural seed. in a message the super sign since I have limited time I'll just do the quoting right away he says remember there was a natural seed of Abraham and a supernatural seed of Abraham the natural seed of Abraham according to Genesis 22 where we have actually read it he says thy seed shall possess the gate of Israel The natural seed of Abraham was Isaac. So through the seed of Isaac, we find that they also did possess the gates of their enemies. One time they had three of them down in Babylon. Remember, they came out of that lineage in that great big city there. that was built a super city. But they had a supernatural and they throwed them into a super fire seven times hotter than it was ever here. And there was a supernatural sign of a supernatural God standing in the fire, supernaturally saving them. What did they do? They possessed the gates of the furnace. There was another one down there named Daniel, Abraham's seed. What happened? He stayed true to God. He know that he was the seed of Abraham. He know he was doing right. They throw him into the lion's a supernatural light. An animal is afraid of light. So a supernatural light, a supernatural angel came down by a man that believed in supernatural and delivered him and he stayed all night in the lion's den and was supernaturally brought out the next morning because he believed and trusted in a supernatural God and he possessed the gates of the lionist. Oh hallelujah. Amen. But then he says, "But one day, one day they come on the supernatural scene. All these over possess the gates of their enemy because they they they believed in a supernatural God." Are you following me? But they were the natural seed of Abraham. They possessed the the gates of heaven because they believed in the supernatural. But he says, "But one day there came a supernatural seed which was born by a supernatural birth." Amen. There is something that I want us to see. You can overcome even when you are natural seed by believing in a supernatural God. How much more when you are a supernatural seed. Amen. Having born by a supernatural power there the devil can defeat you. Amen. Amen. They that are born of God, overcome the world. We are going to overcome the world. Not because we so much believe in God, but because we are born of God. They that are born of God overcome the world. So Jesus was another seed that came what? a supernatural seed which was born by a supernatural birth. Born not by a natural birth, but by a supernatural birth, by the supernatural faith which Abraham had, not according to the sexual desire of Abra and what God did to him that way, but through a supernatural faith. that he had and faith is supernatural. It does supernatural things and through Abraham's faith as he was here hundreds of years later come the supernatural seed that he believed in. And when the supernatural seed come on earth, he did a supernatural sign of a supernatural prophet. Are you following me? He was greater than a prophet. [Music] He was a God prophet to give a natural people a supernatural birth. What did he do? He went before us and died, but they couldn't hold him. Abraham's grave is still there. Isaac grave is still there, but there is an empty tomb on the supernatural scene. A supernatural work had a supernatural resurrection. We better begin to believe in something supernatural. By the way, when I see myself in a natural way, I don't see how I can be saved in any way. But when I see the supernatural God and the supernatural work he has done in me, I don't see how I can be Lord. We need to begin looking at the supernatural God in us. Let me tell you something. The purpose of this message is to make us identify who we really are, which kind of seed we are. I just pray as I labor this evening that the Lord will reveal it to you. He says what what did he do in doing it? He conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave and he possessed its gates. He rose on the third day in a supernatural resurrection. He said, "I have the keys of death and hell. I was he who was once dead and now I am alive forever more." Because I live. The seed of Abraham shall live also. There you are. So I am with you always. Even in the end of the world and the works that I do shall you also. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So who was Jesus? Can you follow me now? We have seen the natural lineage of Abraham and there are many on that natural lineage of Abraham that knowing their true origin. They possess the gates of their enemies from Daniel to the three Hebrew children to David to many of all these ones. They were part of that natural image. They kept possessing the gifts of their enemies. We also see the Jews who claimed to be part of the natural. But when the word came before them, they rejected him. Jesus said because you have done this you are lying. Your father is not Abra. He cannot be. You cannot be of that natural unit because everybody from that natural lineage believes in the word. So Jesus said you are lying you are of your father that you works of your father you do. And then he said but I came and he says I know who I am. That's what he was trying to say. I know who I am. I am from God. I go back to God. Jesus knew who he was. He knew he was the spiritual supernatural seed of Abraham. And he had a claim on. And in the same way, Amen. The natural seed of Abraham Excuse me continuous even today we can find them in Israel natural seed of Abraham [Music] in the same way even oh the supernatural seed of Abraham the supernatural seed of Abraham is also continuous Hallelujah. Hallelujah. How do you know? You can trace it all the way back from at the beginning. When you see how the first one behave, then you will see all the others. They will behave the same way. They will have the same character. They will have the same life. They will have the same supernatural effect in their life. Are you following me, church? Amen. So, who was the first in this lineage? Jesus. And that's what the Bible said. He's the beginning of the new creation. Amen. Now, after him, Amen. How was he born? He was born of the word. He himself was the word made manifest. Amen. And when he was born, he was born of the word. And he came down here on earth with a purpose because he knew his true origin. He knew he came from God. He would go about to be God. He knew he was born in a supernatural way. The natural things were below him. Nothing of the word controlling. He suffered the things we suffer but he never looked at it as if it was the final verdict. He never saw anything in this world as if it spoke of his destiny. Amen. He saw the supernatural thing because that is what actually spoke of his true origin. The answer is in the seed. Hallelujah. And when he came down, he knew who he was. And because he knew who he was, he conquered death. He conquered sin. He conquered the flesh. He conquered everything. After conquering everything on earth, then there was one another enemy that was always conquering everybody. That's called death. He said, "I will go and I will die and I will conquer death so that everyone that is born in the same way that I was born will be able to conquer death." And when he conquered death, now another one, Amen, who was born of God, Apostle Paul, he writes and says, "Death, where is your sting? How could he be able to save us? Because Jesus had conquered them. Amen. A believer does not fear death. Hallelujah. If the devil scares to kill you, you tell him, "Bring it on." Let me tell you, brethren, me, I don't fear death. Whether you shoot me or you kick me or you bang on me or whatever it is, I only fear for my little children. When I go, they may suffer. But personally, when I die, I know where I am going. I don't fear death because death lost. Amen. Jesus died. Hallelujah. Amen. Death lost his sting. Amen. And after he conquered death, he conquered hell also. He conquered the grave also. So let me tell you tonight, can I preach to you a little bit? There's hell and the grave have no power over a believer who is born again of the same supernatural spirit. Amen. Amen. and he possesses gates. He rose on the third day in a supernatural resurrection. We who were dead but are now many through Christ. You see, we have also resurrected. Hallelujah. I have the keys of death and holiness. Amen. I was he who was once paid. And now I am alive forever more. And because I live the seed of Abraham shall live also. Who is the seed of Abraham? They that are born of God. They that are born of the Holy Ghost. Amen. They that are born again. Born of the word shall live also. Amen. There you are. He says I am with you always even to the end of the world. and the works that I do. Oh, may God reveal this one to us. Amen. Before we go to the rapture, each of us, you want to see this portion, the works that I do, shall you also. The works that I do, the same works he did, we can do also. Amen. Talk about the life he lived. Talk about the miracles he did. Talk about the signs and wonders. Talk about the life of God. It must be made manifest in the royal seed. Amen. So this he rose again. And that's why we read Revelation 5 on Sunday because he alone is worthy. If you look again right there at Revelation 5 because of time I'll read only in Luganda in English rather and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and lose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to lose the neither to look their own. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look there on. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold the line of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne, and the and the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a lamb, as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book and and the four beasts and the four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them haps and golden vials full of orders which are the prayers of the saints and they sang a new song saying thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals. I want you to notice those words. Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals there. For thou was slain and has redeemed us to God by the blood out of every kindred and nation and tongue and people and has made us unto our God kings and priest and we shall do what? Reign on the earth. He alone is worthy. He took the book and opened the seven seals. And all those whose identity was lost is now restored is now redeemed. So why did he die? Amen. in order to restore to bring back the identity of every part. Amen. Of the body of every one of those that were of the seed, the royal seed, he has restored it. And these are the ones that cannot sin. These are the ones who cannot die. These are the ones who will go in the rapture. These are the ones who are blood and perfect without spot without wrinkle wash in the blood of this lamb because the lamb was worthy of you see friends the issue was to restore the identity. Amen. I'll quickly take this portion in the bridge where the prophet says now what is this book of redemption this title did abstract title did you say abstract what does an abstract means it is searched all the way back to its beginning like that Little drop of ink this morning. When it struck that bridge bleach, it went all the way back. You remember we talked about that little drop of ink when you put in a bleach. How it completely is is disappears. And when sin has been confessed and fallen in the blood of Jesus, oh my gives an abstract Rise straight back to the creator again. And now here's the part I wanted. You become a son of God. Abstract title deed is held in the hands of the almighty. His redemption means you want to hear this portion. The redemption of this title did means all legal possession of all that was lost by Adam and Eve. Again Christian is legal possession. It is legal possession to that abstract deed title deed of eternal life. It means you possess everything that Adam and Eve lost. uh the possession of that deed. It means you possess everything that Adam and Eve are. It means you possess life. It means you possess joy. It means you possess everything you desire. Why? Because all the authority that Adam and Eve lost. You know there was a promise that the seed of the woman will come and who breathe the head of the serpent. What was it for? This seed of the woman is the royal seed of Abra. The seed of of the royal seed of Abraham we see was Jesus Christ. And we see the same lamb that was worthy to take the book out of the hand of him. on the throne and he took the book and he was worthy to open the seal. Now let me tell you something and the prophet asks a question. What does that mean? He says it means that the book of redemption. Amen. He he he alone was worth to take it and open it. And then he continues on to say what is it is the abstract title to everything that Adam lost. Hallelujah. Everything that Adam lost. What did Adam lose? Adam lost everything from power to ownership. sickness is coming and we get sick every day. We struggle every day. We we we struggle with life and things in life. Adam was not that way. Adam was perfect. Adam was in the image of God. His word could create. He could direct animals. He had power over animals. That's why the Bible says all of it, all the nature is groaning, they groaning, waiting for the sons of God to be manifested. Because when the sons of God are manifested again, then they will no longer suffer. Also when Adam lost when Adam fell he fell every everything in the human rather everything in the on the earth also became disintegrated animals like lions we were not running out from human beings but even now a hair and a chicken will run away when you try to cut You see how everything is messed up? These creatures, we are supposed to have the preeminence over them. But we don't cuz we are fallen from from our first estate. But because the lamb came and took the book of what is it? He has redeemed back and he has brought back the title deed. What is it? is the authority to everything that Adam lost. Now when we speak these things, the world thinks it's a joke. And some believers think it is a joke. But I tell you, brother, it cannot be made manifest until you personally receive a revelation of it. It is not going to be restored to a group or else even a message believer would have received it. It is going to be re amen brought back to every adopted child of God as individuals because God works with us as individuals. And this must must be even before the rapture. We have already seen it happen in the life of brother and this is how each of us must walk power and authority controlling life on earth controlling events around our life not allowing situations and events to control us. Amen. Because I will tell you something in the millennium we are going to be just like that. And everything we are going to have we potentially have now and even what has not yet manifested. It means we have not grown to that level yet but everything is already here. There is no more revelation coming. We only need to feed on the water and throw. It's just like if you tell a child, a little boy and and then you tell him, "Oh, you know what? Little boy, you have very many children." He just laugh at you. Say, "You have many children." Where do you mean that? He just doesn't know. He's young. [Music] Amen. and feed him with food every day. Every day. Every day. Amen. And soon he will become an adulant. And when he becomes an adult, the body will begin striking. He'll begin to feel certain things. Why? Because something wants to come up. Amen. Something wants to be manifested. And then soon or later, he gets married. Amen. Many children begin to brother had to tell his son. We are not the only one supposed to populate the whole. So go slow. Are you following me? But if you told a little bitty Paul that you have many children, he would have laughed. So listen to me, church. The things I'm speaking about true. If it is not yet manifested in your individual life, it doesn't mean it's not true. Just keep eating the word. Keep eating the word. And one of these glorious mornings. Amen. Without even thinking about it, you you will be in a hard situation. You will be in a tight corner. And then something will happen. Amen. whereby you realize you have some supernatural authority over situations in your life. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Who could tell brother that can stop a very big stubborn bull with just a word? Who could tell him? If they told him, would he believe it? Hallelujah. Brother Bam himself says when he walked into that place, he had forgotten to read that there is a a very angry bull here and he knew about it but he had forgotten all about it. So he found himself in a fix in a tight corner. His back against the wall and he says nowhere could he tried to run but he realized everywhere around him he could not climb over before the bull arrived where he was. So what did he do? He stood his ground and then in a moment Amen. What is it? It is a sense of a son of God. Call it godly instinct under pressure. That godly instinct, every born again son of God has it. But many times it cannot manifest until you yourself are found in a pressure. When you're in a pressure zone, you will even be surprised. Was I the one who did it? And then brother Bam in a moment he stood his ground and then a bull came and bam stood his ground and all of a sudden he felt something in his heart. A love for this animal. What was that? The Bible says God is love. Talk about a son of God that is adopted. God is love. And then out of him and he felt love for this animal. And he began to speak to Eve. Doesn't that look like Adam before the for? I'm sorry, bull. I'm really so sorry. I didn't I didn't I didn't mean to disturb you. I had forgotten everything about please do not harm me. I'm God servant and was like all right brother tell me what that is tell me what that is when a man filled with demon powers comes at brother Brham on the pull pit and he comes to to break every bone in his body in his body. That maniac he said I'll break every bone in your body and the deacons rush. I can I can right now imagine brother But as an adopted son of God, redeemed, restored, perfect said, "Leave him alone. Let him come. In a moment, he will be at my feet." How did he know? He never saw a vision. All these circumstances I'm giving you, it was not by vision. So it's not by gift. It is by identity. It is by authority and power of who you are. God reveal this to us. Hallelujah. And the man came. I break every bonding. M [Music] fell down. What happened there? What happened? What is it? It was just a moment. Brother never prayed about it. Brother never saw a vision about it. But he swung into action under that pressure as a son of God. Let me tell you brothers, sisters, the things we are preaching about, excuse me, the things we are preaching about may look sometimes as if it it is not reality. But if you receive what we're talking about, oh brother, sister, when you in a moment of a squeeze, yourself personally, pressure builds up. You will realize certain abilities you possess. Before before you could not turn down a boy, do you not turn down a guy, you don't know how to do it. But after speaking and eating the word, all of a sudden you have an experience with the Holy Ghost. Then you realize there is certain power and authority that you now possess and you wield over others, over nature. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. So these are the things I'm preaching about. The redemption means all legal possession [Music] to all that was lost by Adam. It means is restored back again. It is restored to us the church. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Adam could not meet the requirements of redemption after he found he was lost. He sinned and he had separated himself from God. He was on this side of the cousin. So he could not redeem it. He just couldn't. He needed redemption. But the grace of God made this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ. Lord required it. Grace made it requirements. Oh amazing grace as sweet as God's law required an innocent substitute in a message and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies. Now remember thy seed shall possess the gates of his enemies. The seed shall possess. Tell your neighbor the seed shall possess. Now he's talking now of Abraham's seed. And how do we become Abraham's seed? By being dead in Christ. Colossians chapter 3. We when we were dead in Christ, we become Abraham seed also. We are dead. Oh hallelujah. Amen. Say hallelujah somebody. Hallelujah. We are dead to the things of the world and we begin a new creation in Christ Jesus. Then the Holy Spirit that was in Christ is in us and that makes us Abraham's seed and it gives us Abraham's faith. We are Abraham's seed. That means we too must possess the gates of our heaven. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why Jesus said to Peter, Amen, for thou art Peter and upon this rock, I will build my church and the gates of my hallelujah. The gates of heaven shall not prevail. And I will give unto thee the key. of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever thou shall be bound in heaven, whatever thou shalt lose shall be loo. We possess that same power to possess every gate. You see why? Why does Jesus say this? Because he knows we too like him are the seed of Abraham. So we can possess every gift. We can possess gifts. I have some people here as I'm finishing that feel like possessing some gifts. Amen. By the way, this thing is revealed to you as an individual as an individual and then you receive a revelation. There's a brother here who was sick on Sunday having joints in the in in the pain in the leg. He couldn't stand. He was sitting. But as he was hearing the word, revelation struck him. Suddenly, hey, you're a son of God, you have authority over your body. And then you know what? He he began saying, "Amen." And the pain was gone instantly. Now, let me tell you, brother, you may doubt that testimony. Don't worry, you are a doubter. But you will not doubt it if it is you experiencing a testimony. If God reveals to you that you can possess certain gifts and you you begin to bind and to lose and bind and lose, those things only happen by supernatural power that comes by supernatural revelation of who you are. Let us stand our feet. Hallelujah. We can possess the gates of our enemy. We can possess the gates of sickness. We can possess the gates of doubt. We can possess the gates of witchcraft. We can possess the gates of cancer. Amen. That has kept on coming to me. The gifts of cancer. Maybe someone who has cancer is missing. But I tell you, we have the power to possess the gifts of cancer. We can possess the gifts of fear. You know, we have the power. It has to be revealed to you as an individual. Oh hallelujah. Amen. Begin to possess now in time. Oh hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Let me pray for those on Zoom. Maybe you are somewhere in your home or work struggling with something. There's nobody coming to pray for you. You not realize who you are now. This is later than we think. Come to a place, come to realization of who you are now, and you'll be free. And you'll be free. For they that are sons of God are born of God. And they that are born of God are free indeed. For he that a son sets free are free indeed. May God make you free right now in the name of Jesus Christ. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you Jesus. Oh, I bless your name and magnify your name Lord because of your goodness and your mercies and your love is everlasting Lord. Hallelujah.
