now listen to me church all of you said the true truth whenever you get there some of you say the deeper truth [Applause] jesus was slain yes before the foundation of the world hallelujah amen behold the lamb of god that was slain before the foundation [Applause] the word now you'll get a chicken now do you remember when uh when john saw jesus he said behold the lamb of god of the world the am i preaching to someone here tonight hallelujah the lamb when was the lamb slain the lamb was not saying two thousand years ago the lamb was not slain when you sinned the and he says god in the beginning he says and jesus was laying before the foundation of the world yes every person was that was saved was saved dialogue according to the bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of god yeah [Music] and naive how do i know that i'm cold because i was predestinated how do i know that i was pretty surprised because i was in his mind you were included in salvation then hallelujah amen we ought to be shouting because of that [Music] the devil can i some of you will get some good revelations please tayanukura it is all nothing so you see that's why when we receive the calls we have to answer questions oh my name foreign but this man went to hell [Music] i shall not be moved i shall not be i shall not be moving [Music] just like a tree ninja motif that's planted [Applause] running after you check yourself away because if the devil is not fighting you it means he has already won the devil already disappeared from you it means there is a problem it means you are not used to it is a situation of the devil it means you are the friend of the devil but i am so glad tonight send him a sentence [Music] the devil is after me the devil is fighting the side of me because he knows he is secretary [Music] amen hallelujah help me to to to bring this up you help me by saying amen by me now so that i don't lose the inspiration christians hallelujah that those that were in his mind away and when you come [Applause] is when they come into this world somebody jammu says you will be born in the midst of all this spirit you are making a god no god they are born in sin assad mutually come

praise the name of [Music] by the mercies of god always such a catholic present your bodies present your bodies a living sacrifice we are not giving blocks anymore we are not giving sheep anymore said that we can destroy ourselves as a living sacrifice a holy sacrifice attacking an acceptable success unto god that is our reasonable services [Music] he says not all together the fornicators of the world but those who are fornicators yet calling themselves believers don't even accompany [Music] [Applause] yet they apostle paul says don't even accompany me why what because of sure someone has decided financial manager things must drop off because there is a power in the world set free armenia the power of the liberates [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen i said hallelujah amen that's why we should not do church mechanism if you're dodging church that's the devil making you to dodge fellowship today but then that very moment of god control the faith in that person and the the gift of god in the man of god when the demons are living why because of the power of the world and that's why the devil doesn't want us to fellowship [Music] and this happens by our transformation that [Music] and then you continue coming in the fellowship here in the world of god the word of god begins to purify you a holy sacrifice unto the lord our mind has to be renewed by the world in the words of the faith some people they are hard not to crack [Music] oh he has grown they don't accept the word to renew them but let me tell you if you want to go far with the lord you must yield or you know where you are you know you must sacrifice into another image other 11 29 the scripture says for the gifts and calling of god are without repentance way the gifts of god and the calling of god no queen queen are without repentance [Music] i with that they come to you without repentance because you are called because you have been designated not because [Music] now what is our calling we are called to manifest the true character and nature of christ [Music] you're you forget that you are supposed to manifest the nature and character of christ how do we forget hallelujah

treat them like the other man is treating their woman oh [Music] [Music] hallelujah amen if she's beautiful that's good that's okay whatever she is is [Music] if you find someone in here [Music] amen that we should be called the sons of god faith amen that the father has done be stolen from we are called to be sons of god it is called justification [Applause] to hallelujah amen glory we are going to the rapture because you have been glorified hallelujah amen because you're being justified are we the sons of god [Applause] i i am now happy not only is christ but i am also his brother jesus is not only my ass yes it is what does that to the image of his son jesus and i come after him [Music] now has received him them gave him power to be calm today we get back to become hallelujah amen
