[Music] Lord Jesus we want to come before you tonight [Music] we ask Lord that you will come and use us tonight for the blessing of your children help us run in this restaurant [Music] in Jesus Christ amen amen Hallelujah he was diagnosed with malaria is the second day of my treatment maybe throw up anytime everything [Music] is pray for me I don't throw up on the cool kids pray for me that God will give you strength support says [Music] foreign can we say I mean if we believe amen you may have your seats so this evening I'm speaking on the 60th sense what we spoke on Sunday it's really a continuation and I'm speaking today on I am if you have your book by button to the book of Hebrews the word in a Bible you again to Hebrews 11. and let us read from verse 1 and we will read most of the chapter all of the chapter and I want you to be attentive tonight that's what the holy spirit will have for us away now he says now Faith is the substance of things for the evidence of Things Not Seen obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen we are not made of things which do appears [Music] so whatever was made was not made out of the things that we see it was made of things which do not appeared by faith offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain by which you obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speaking of God of things not not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became hair of the righteousness which is by faith is notice that all these people were able to please God by faith God warned him of things which had not yet come down to the saving of his heart [Music] by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went away foreign [Music] has foundations whose Builder and Mecca is God through faith also Sarah has self-received strength to conceive sin and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised there are for sprung sprung there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in the in the in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea show innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them are far off and were persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country where from which they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desire that better country that is our Heavenly Hallelujah wherever God is not ashamed to be called their God for he has prepared for them a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he had received the promises um offered up he's only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come by faith Jacob when he was dying uh blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship and Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and worship leaning upon the tops of his staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of them at The Parting of the children of Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones Listen by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to yes refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ great and riches and the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the river are you listening Church by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endure that seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the past over and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do we're drawn by faith the words of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith they had Raha perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I must say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and a Barack and of Samson and of Jefferson of David also and Samuel and all the prophets who through faith subdue kingdoms not righteousness obtained promises stop the mouths of lions quite the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness we are met strong Works Valiant in fight time to flight the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised to life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance they might obtain a better resurrection and others had tried your cruel mockings and scoldings yeah moreover of Bones and imprisonment they were stoned they were sold asunder were attempted were slain with sword they were they wandered about in sheep's skin and got skin being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the word was not worthy they wanted in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect when you read this Hebrews 11 years see The Chronicles of Faith before who had faith and he even ended by saying that all of them died having not obtained a promise you know somewhere in the Bible it says that I think also is in the book of Hebrews it says that uh if Joshua had given them rest is that now there remaineth thereof arrest for the people of God and now the seventh day Adventists take that scripture to mean that that's rest that was remaining was the Sabbath race because actually in the book in the KJV says for if Jesus had given them rest then he wouldn't have talked of another day but but you see there he was meaning Joshua Joshua did not give these people rest yes when Moses brought them out of Egypt Joshua took them into the promised land yes and they believed on God through us to their souls after fighting for years and years we are going to finally go to our promised land and rest yeah Joshua [Music] by faith they did what they did Faith they never obtained a promise say today under the dispensation of faith in Christ amen we have obtained the true promise of the Holy ghosts of the change of our bodies and these men and women were men and women of Faith surely none of us has reached any of them talk about Moses they never let go they believed God foreign did you realize that Abraham was ready to give his son Abraham believed in the resurrection I believe it even if I give my son God is able to raise him up again had never requested for child sacrifice God had never requested for human sacrifice you read your Bible That's the only sacrifice God has never asked question my Bible yes not for you to die but because Jesus Christ died in your state yes the only human that has ever died we may be able to surrender ourselves not just die because he was a human like any of us died because he was the I am yeah and we are supposed to believe in him our faith must be built on something and today in the service I will take one example here they another in chapter 11 of John and I'd like you to look at it tonight our faith must have a basis notice that it is not I'm not saying he was Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and foreign [Music] [Music] remember when Peter was you know when he when they saw Jesus coming walking oh they realized I am is coming yeah but if you are the one let me also walk on the water like you now Jesus said you can come so I started walking but he was so happy yeah he removed his eyes on Jesus and he put his eyes on his brothers and sisters he started sinking the world will be around you prayers of the world and temptations of the world all Troubles of the world let me tell you what keeps a believer Hallelujah Amina now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister Martha um is the brother to marry and mother right you remember this Mary is the same woman that bowed to the feet of Jesus and washed Jesus's feet with your own kids so Jesus has a long connection with his with his family I love it when Jesus is not in connection with only me but with my family amen then he has a more reason to come to your rescue [Music] look at verse 3 says it was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick remember we talked about this woman sometimes with Jesus Christ but from that experience has never been the same again his sister sent unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick now Jesus was not only friends with Mary and Martha but it was also a friend with Lazarus yes and when they were sending for Jesus listen friends of Jesus we are telling Jesus about his friends okay when you when you pray such a prayer foreign if you are a friend of Jesus telling Jesus about his friends oh Jesus yes your friend a baby is in trouble Jesus is your friend yes you must always show up take a joke Amina so the way they wrote the letter words when Jesus had that he said this sickness is not unto death yes [Applause] for the glory of God might be glorified thereby Jesus love that he was sick he Abode two days still in the same place where he was think about it [Music] he did not go to them he never sent anybody to them because he loved them isn't it amazing what do we believe it today oh that Jesus loved you so much yes but when you were in trouble oh what a love no we are talking about faith and we are talking about Let Me Tell Lazarus [Music] he is trying to tell them in your situation you may not see me but I am foreign foreign I'm so happy to preach this when I'm feeling like puking then you say okay because I feel the way I've seen that doesn't mean God disapproves of me because you are going through what you are going through it doesn't mean God disapproves of you neither are the bright skies and still want the signs of his love and approvala every day oh because everything is good and candy his approval of any of us foreign [Music] Uganda he loves us amen Hallelujah yes sir I said hallelujah hallelujah he loves you hallelujah amen he loves you whether you are they are saying to be his son he called us hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen the devil is going to be in trouble after this so do we are going to doubt God is love because of what we are going through together three Hebrew children he's able to save us or not look what they wanted that we know we love him and he loves us if it is for his name was sake we are ready we know for Too Many Loves Us we shall die that he loves us that is in all the times the only thing that is and tomorrow the same things I will not cry because I know he loves you I will say oh Lord Jesus thank you for loving me I receive it in your name again knowing whether things change or they do not change and that's why we cannot leave him because we were in him before foreign [Music] trials to come your way in his wisdom he saw that the Destroyer will be good for my daughter he thought surely my son can enjoy this is [Music] you're not proving that God that you love God how do you prove that you love God number one number two by conducting yourself [Music] of you need wisdom allowed to come to you where is hallelujah in your wisdom you thought even at 27 I should not be married yet thank you for your grace [Music] even when all my other fellows have gone ahead of me in his wisdom he thought I should be at this stage I'm joyful from my house no matter what they go through a Believer is not expected at any time so brother what is it be quiet when I'm in this situation I can be dangerous do you understand Omani who you are sorry if only you knew who you were under my literally you would not behave that to a brother the one days that were sisters [Applause] [Music] foreign foreign how about your day your mother body so you want to go back to those people they wanted to kill you those Jews are not easy after two days now this is the third day so he wants to go back because he has to go cubanga foreign [Music] which will make the devil thing I didn't understand your clothes Jesus can never come back again so that he's coming will be a great Victory not only for you Amina even our God is wise he doesn't want to do anything which doesn't also give him glory so you want him to give you something quickly how does it benefit you see he allows things to happen for his glory okay so everybody's fearing to go back so Jesus answered yes because he sees the light of this world Jesus was trying to show them something yes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever yes we need to understand things happened when we come to him we must believe he is we must believe he does not change hallelujah amen but if a man walk in the line in the night is tumbling yes if I walk without Christ you stumble because there is no light in him this thing said he and after that he says unto them I foreign [Music] [Music] he shall do well how about Jesus speak unto he of his death yes but they thought that he had spoken of taking rest inside then said Jesus unto them plainly yes Lazarus is dead you know many times God speaks to us but we don't understand because our mind is so narrowing into others we need to have faith is Revelations ye may believe already say nevertheless let us go unto him all these verses are so rich which is called this is the guy who doubts so some have said his fellow disciples laughs he knew that Jesus was hunted there yeah we knew if we go there we are gone we are finished so let's just go and die together you see sometimes we need to have the faith like that on someone we should be like we should be like that woman Esther they said I'm going before the king yeah hallelujah amen said let's go with him so that you can die with him [Applause] follow Jesus have faith in here everybody should die with him die with him if people call you a fanatic Republic Missouri then when Jesus came and he found that he had laid in the grave four days already yes we have to Karnataka come on now Bethany was night now unto Jerusalem Bethany uh off and many of the Jews came to Martha and married to comfort them concerning their brothers [Music] as soon as she had that Jesus was coming yesterday went and met him at Mary sat still in the house it doesn't matter whether you've run to go meet him or whether you're in the house he is since you don't know what to say this is quite amazing for me it doesn't matter where they were Jesus was yes he did not change praise the Lord praise the Lord let's follow still here now it's a very good story and many of the Jews all right now then said Master unto Jesus not even now Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today if you hadn't been here that is all right it would have been good but now the woman I realize [Music] things will change then my brother was alive the difference things might have changed once he comes in the equation let me let me skip here so I can get to that quote for you and Matt around to find Jesus I'm reading from uh uh from the super sense praise the Lord when must I run to find Jesus Lord I wish you were here situations what people thought could not be changed Jesus put himself together this is the resurrection all right let's go back to our scriptures going to across all right Nina praise the Lord come help us away okay so brother says there is I know even now whatsoever that will ask of God God will give it to me thy Brothers now at that moment I would like to say that Martha actually believes in Jesus but her last words there foreign she lacked Faith she lacked a revelation yes of that moment promises that God has made to us but we always push them in the future we believe them you can believe something and not have faith about it okay let me let me prove that to you Mark chapter 9 verse 23. if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believe yes and straight away the father of the child Cried Out say it with tears Lord I believe help thou my unbelief okay Lord I believe yeah foreign [Music] right yeah okay but the man says you are able to believe it is believing it is one thing but faith is something else but he realized now the Bible says that you don't need even much Faith some of these things you had Faith Like a seed of a mustard mustard you can tell a mountain to be removed from here so now we believe all these things I believe my brother but she lacked face how can it be possible but in the resurrection it will be but in the resurrection that's how we believe God many times but that's not what God is requiring God requires us to have faith foreign [Music] religious God expects you to have faith God wants to do amen he wants to give you that Revelation I remember one day I was going to uh I was going to go to God God gave me a vision a place where I was supposed to go I did not know the place but uh you know supposed to help me guide me to go there I did not have money enough to go now with the vision already I knew I had to go but now I didn't have money but God help me help me Vision built up my face I told my wife just helped me get back here I didn't even ask nobody she said not yourself you know exercise when you you become old 90 years promise in your life foreign yeah and said the resurrection I am in sexy life a life not a resurrection but I am the resurrection in the morning meaning without me there is no Resurrection there is no life anymore and if he was declaring I am the resurrection no matter how sick you are no matter how much need you I'm here to tell you foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] but if if you see somebody you know they're in charge but but you don't even know who their friends are drag nobody to charge it's a bit questionable I remember when I believe the message and some of them are preachers today you two need to do the same thing put your friends to church you are not going to give them the revelations to hear this yeah foreign she loves the feet so much whenever she saw Jesus why don't you love Mary Maria I love Mary Mary she was so humble yeah oh my God then when Mary was come and when I meet I will ask her Mary tell me anyway laughs then Mary was come where Jesus and she said that to him and she was on the feet down I think she was kissing the feet when Jesus saw how weeping yes and the Jews also weeping which came with us he grown in the spirit and said where have you ladies let me tell you yes the Bible says the height s amen he feels and he actually shares it with you he feels the pain and so he says Where have you later he said unto you unto him Lord of you and Jesus asked you what's going on he can be passed acquired by the spirit Oh What A Savior hallelujah amen Oh What A Savior what a manner of man is this if you're going through pain or suffering through it with you if you need this together with you the Jews some of them said he could not this man which opened the eyes that even this man should not have died that's what Jesus wanted he wanted to get this man so the Lamb of sin the glory of God if this man opened the eyes of the blind so he not have stopped this man from dying Jesus but nobody came late he had a plan he didn't take the car if Jesus comes late in your life be happy my brother that you can be true before I'm here to prophesy you believe this he has a plan for your life it is on purpose if he comes to the grave of my life [Music] what do you think is going to happen something in me One Direction tomorrow is going to rise up yes Lord I need you in my life it was a cave yeah yeah this time yeah for he has been dead for days [Applause] I don't care your situation church this is for you to change I don't care how far you've gone you may be dead but God wanted you to be in that conditions that if thou would disbelief thou should see the glory of God oh my God how many feet are tingling that moment when everything seems to have faith when he even that it was supposed to be a savior is weeping and crying begins to talk like no one has ever talked wait I go you'll get it he begins to talk like no one else I believe the others began to be confused Jesus had spoken to Martha Mary yes let me tell you believe who is here today if you believe you're going to see the glory of God Amen so they took away the stop father daughter Hallelujah and he began to say father I thank thee that thou has to hurt me and I knew that thou herest me always but because of the people which stand by I said it that they may believe that thou has sent me it is had spoken he cried with a loud voice foreign where are you hallelujah amen and and he that was dead came first he was born and foot with gray clothing and his face was bound about with a napkin again I
