[1:16:40] traveled early in the morning uh was it
[1:16:42] last night
[1:16:46] and a show
[1:16:53] i know some have been asking he told me
[1:16:54] that his mom was sick and so he had he
[1:16:56] had an appointment with the doctor for
[1:16:58] to operate on the eyes
[1:17:15] uh
[1:17:16] brother polly kept giving a prayer
[1:17:18] request
[1:17:23] say try your best
[1:17:27] to come to church on sundays
[1:17:43] never cook but for kids no one was
[1:17:44] telling me that some students at school
[1:17:46] what were you a young man
[1:17:50] i feel bad i just feel like going home
[1:17:54] what what's the word they use bacon is
[1:17:56] that the gambot
[1:18:04] i believe a child of god should also be
[1:18:06] under stress if they refuse to go to
[1:18:08] church
[1:18:39] so this morning by the grace of god
[1:18:42] already
[1:18:43] i have a subject i want to take from
[1:18:45] what we have read
[1:18:49] and i want you to follow me closely
[1:19:13] the same god who uses them is the same
[1:19:15] god that uses it
[1:19:20] and his word is the same it is
[1:19:23] a church praise the lord come here so we
[1:19:25] don't boss over any ability the true
[1:19:27] enemy is
[1:19:28] supposed to be the best in the ability
[1:19:30] of the word of god
[1:19:33] to transform our lives and give us what
[1:19:35] we need
[1:19:37] to watch
[1:19:39] so i have a very funny subject
[1:19:45] do not go very fast
[1:19:48] negative
[1:20:00] these words were not spoken by me but by
[1:20:02] pharaoh if you can't move in the caesar
[1:20:06] and pharaoh is uh was a man who thought
[1:20:10] he was god falafel
[1:20:14] just like we had a man here in uganda
[1:20:29] and he was able to convince people to
[1:20:31] believe him
[1:20:37] and instantly is a man out of my own
[1:20:39] tribe
[1:20:42] so in our tribe we had a god
[1:20:52] so sometimes when i tell people my name
[1:20:54] is they asked me are you also part of
[1:20:56] osaka's religious
[1:21:03] that is because he comes from the same
[1:21:05] tribe like i do that name is meant to
[1:21:07] say he is the one with all authority
[1:21:26] because god has no beginning and god has
[1:21:28] not ended
[1:21:30] until he had been coming and that's why
[1:21:32] when jesus died he rose again
[1:21:38] when jesus died he rose again yes
[1:21:44] [Music]
[1:22:09] egypt
[1:22:10] and they missed it it was through their
[1:22:12] great grandparents
[1:22:16] and you remember how joseph was so
[1:22:18] blessed
[1:22:21] and how he was favored
[1:22:24] even among the foreigners the egyptians
[1:22:29] and how god used him in a mighty way
[1:22:33] and how they received him and all his
[1:22:35] people
[1:22:36] able now and they gave them a place
[1:22:39] for and that place was called gossip
[1:22:44] so they lived in goshen for most of
[1:22:45] their lives
[1:22:49] you have to understand many died and
[1:22:50] many were born casually
[1:22:55] others died and others were born
[1:23:00] but all of them were born into becoming
[1:23:03] servants of pharaoh
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] who has experienced in those things to
[1:24:04] help us

[2:00:53] ordinary iraq coming in here and
[2:00:55] deceiveth them that dwell on the earth
[2:00:57] by the means of those miracles which you
[2:00:59] had power to do
[2:01:00] in the sight of the beast saying to them
[2:01:02] that dwell on the earth that they should
[2:01:04] make an image to the beast which had the
[2:01:06] wound by a sword and did leave and he
[2:01:09] had power to give life unto the image of
[2:01:11] the beast that the image of the beast
[2:01:13] should both speak and cause
[2:01:15] and cause that as many
[2:01:18] as would worship the image of the beast
[2:01:21] should be killed
[2:01:22] and it causes
[2:01:24] all both small and great rich and poor
[2:01:26] free and bound to receive a mark in
[2:01:28] their right hand or in their foreheads
[2:02:18] some people have been saying that this
[2:02:20] mark of the beast is going to be
[2:02:22] received through vaccinations
[2:02:30] and they have told and scared people to
[2:02:34] resist or disease from being vaccinated
[2:02:40] i want to say
[2:02:42] that it's just not true
[2:02:45] however much i would like to believe it
[2:02:46] but it's not true
[2:02:48] i got the chick it is an institute
[2:02:50] because you have already been given a
[2:02:51] shower the profession
[2:02:55] we know the mark of the beast is real
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:52] what is this image which will be made
[2:03:54] like under the beast
[2:03:58] it's going to be the union of all
[2:04:01] denominations together
[2:04:06] we already sing it for me
[2:04:08] to cheer
[2:04:27] [Music]
[2:06:00] of the
[2:06:02] [Music]
[2:06:14] under
[2:06:22] [Music]
[2:06:28] and
[2:06:32] as many as you would not worship the
[2:06:34] image of the beast should be killed
[2:06:36] ejaculated i will never touch since the
[2:06:39] cabinet
[2:06:40] when we talk about one world religion
[2:06:42] but together could be me and see your
[2:06:45] name it's a reality
[2:06:47] and it's already for me
[2:06:54] if you are not a member
[2:07:52] what do you think i mean are you not
[2:07:55] that is true
[2:07:56] that is true
[2:07:58] i don't have time to get into this
[2:08:01] and so we find
[2:08:03] that this one world religion an opinion
[2:08:06] will
[2:08:24] [Music]
[2:08:33] we know that those will be the foolish
[2:08:48] so when
[2:09:01] they'll be king
[2:09:16] that's why the bride of christ
[2:09:18] will not go through the tribulation
[2:09:23] the main nominal church will go through
[2:09:25] the tribulations
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:58] and
[2:10:30] amen there are people almost everywhere
[2:10:33] whose hearts are oh help me now with the
[2:10:36] father faith

[2:12:31] another gospel he says
[2:13:00] he knows he
[2:13:14] in
[2:13:29] of christ
[2:13:31] such a crystal to another gospel
[2:13:35] let me ask you a question
[2:13:37] who is he talking to here anyone
[2:14:09] [Music]
[2:14:24] move with them which is such a crisis
[2:14:38] the gospel

[2:15:23] holiness

[2:16:18] bumble and buddy
[2:16:20] and to make matters worse
[2:16:22] they are telling me
[2:16:26] if they find a sister like this one
[2:16:27] wearing a very good dress
[2:17:41] what which fandom of
[2:17:43] the police officers a java city carry
[2:17:49] checking how
[2:17:52] how long
[2:17:53] their dresses chino charity
[2:18:12] give me a moment i'll show you this
[2:18:13] picture this is how serious it is
[2:18:17] but we noticed today
[2:18:19] ah
[2:18:21] it's not no longer the story uh
[2:18:24] what makes it so bad
[2:18:27] at the church
[2:18:28] has connived with the devil
[2:18:36] about the gospel of christ
[2:18:39] thank god
[2:18:41] for you
[2:18:46] hallelujah
[2:18:48] i want to show you this picture
[2:19:46] what happened
[2:19:49] everything can change
[2:19:51] you i understand that times change
[2:19:54] i understand all that even
[2:19:57] change
[2:19:58] one thing i know
[2:20:00] that you know does
[2:20:41] out of the outside
[2:20:48] [Music]
[2:21:24] and then he will begin
[2:21:39] you see
[2:21:43] our generation
[2:21:44] has been perverted we challenge it to
[2:21:47] the gospel
[2:21:50] and the preachers perverting it
[2:21:52] is
[2:22:07] a somebody who has to answer for the
[2:22:09] little baby
[2:22:11] he's a big person
[2:22:14] where do you find that in the bible
[2:22:23] [Music]
[2:22:55] [Music]
[2:23:02] what has gone wrong
[2:23:06] what has gone wrong oh is it
[2:23:08] he's not supposed to be that way baby
[2:23:10] take it
[2:23:11] when you speak about what it's supposed
[2:23:13] to be
[2:23:16] you are called a first preacher
[2:23:22] because
[2:23:24] the people themselves don't don't want
[2:23:25] to hear that
[2:23:30] pastor
[2:23:53] [Music]
[2:24:37] catholicism
[2:24:56] they say you're not spiritual
[2:24:58] where do you find that in the bible
[2:25:02] you all speak in tongues
[2:25:08] do all speak
[2:26:05] today
[2:26:07] and then no
[2:26:09] there is no interpretation
[2:26:13] you will not understand what i'm saying
[2:26:16] but then he says if someone speaks
[2:26:20] [Applause]
[2:26:38] [Music]
[2:26:47] angelia charm is the one
[2:26:51] but there'll be some who pervert the
[2:26:53] gospel of christ
[2:26:57] so the next time you hear a preacher a
[2:26:59] pastor a prophet or whatever
[2:27:34] [Music]
[2:27:46] [Music]
[2:27:57] today there is a perimeter to know with
[2:27:58] the authority to change
[2:28:00] [Music]
[2:28:01] that
[2:28:08] what has been given is enough
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:38] but people choose to believe they are
[2:28:40] preachers rather than the word
[2:28:45] that's why the prophet said if you want
[2:28:47] to get deeper in christ
[2:29:20] when the
[2:29:48] may
[2:30:15] god
[2:30:21] and then he says in the book of god
[2:30:23] 1 6
[2:30:28] that he has soon removed from him that
[2:30:29] called you into the grace of christ
[2:30:31] another i think we've read that then in
[2:30:33] jude 1 we read jude 1 4 he says for
[2:30:36] there are certain men crept in unawares

[2:31:16] the training of the holy ghost
[2:31:21] wants to use you
[2:31:23] now
[2:31:24] he doesn't want the support of man
[2:31:38] that is what he has used from the very
[2:31:47] [Music]
[2:31:53] amen but these men never said about
[2:31:55] where did they come from
[2:32:02] the next thing you know
[2:32:04] they are on the pulpit
