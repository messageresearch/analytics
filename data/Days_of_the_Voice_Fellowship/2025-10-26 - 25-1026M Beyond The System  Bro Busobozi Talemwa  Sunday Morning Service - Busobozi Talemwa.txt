[cheering] &gt;&gt; This is not always an easy moment for the brothers. When [music] he begins to preach is roaring like a lion. that this moment humbled here. Let us pray a blessing upon them. Our kind heavenly father, we have been privileged to witness the betroal of this couple. Lord, I want to to thank you for the life of brother Julius and the life of Sister Faith and how you have led them this way. We know Lord, you are the one that u orders the footsteps of the righteous. Lord, it's been his desire. It's been his prayer. And Lord, for you to bring them to this moment today. It is a victory and we appreciate you Lord. We now ask your blessing upon them for protection for provision and will witness yet again. Brother Joseph and sister Mariam don't forget to pray for them. Their wedding is coming up when coming up when it 22nd November. Yes. &gt;&gt; So, uh this is next month. &gt;&gt; Then brother Enoch I think is also not here. He went to Sister Mass's church where they would also announce their engagement there. Um and so we also remember that couple. And so today, brother Julius and sister Faith, [cheering] &gt;&gt; we say congratulations to you. [applause] &gt;&gt; Uh when do you have uh dates for us yet 23rd March that is the wedding introduction and then you have the dates for the wedding? Not yet. Okay. We please remember those uh those couples in prayer. Amen. And we have more in the pipeline. So there's still a lot of work to do. Praise the Lord. So we need to continue praying for for for that. And you know, of course, you know, the church having a lot of young people. When a church has young people, it is a good thing. It has its own dynamics, but you know, uh, they're always vibrant and on fire and focused, right? But then when they get married, so it's also a good thing, but it has also its own dynamics. So then they become more busy and sometimes you know um then they again you go into having children and so I just don't want you to lose your fire. Tell your neighbor don't lose your fire especially he that is engaged or married and I think I left out one couple sister Monica and brother Sadat. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and so there there do you know your debts yet? No, not yet. Okay. But uh we we are also praying for you. Sister Monica, you were just right here. You should have raised up your hand and reminded me. Amen. I just felt I had forgotten somebody. So and um you know I realize that u of course we we are getting into a different dynamics as a church. Um you know a lot of uh a lot of people getting married. We do not need to lose the focus. You know the Bible says that you know they were giving in marriage and then and then sudden destruction. So So I would like you not to disconnect from the purpose and the purpose is the coming of the Lord, the rapture. do whatever you are doing. But let us focus on the coming of the Lord. Is that amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Sister Stella, we want to welcome you back. God bless you. We pray for you. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to congratulate brother Emmanuel on for his graduation. God bless you. Congratulations, brother Emanuel. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Polap asked me to greet you this morning. Shall we stand? Now we just change the order of the service. We want to go to the word this morning. We are opening from in the book of revelation chapter 3. [clears throat] Revelation 3 14-22. We are reading you know all the message for Ladys here. And unto the angel of the church of the ladians, write these things, sayeth them, amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God. I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would I would thou w. So then, because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich and increase with goods, and have need of nothing. and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked. I counseel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white men that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of th nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and chestn therefore and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as oh I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne. He that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. I mean, Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. foreignch. foreign. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Just as we were praying, just ask the Lord to minister to you this morning. My heavenly father, &gt;&gt; Lord, I I come here to speak to you because I have before me the purchase of your blood. I do not take it lightly to be in a service like this where many come not to hear from a man but to hear from heaven. Lord, may may you take this moment and minister your word of life to us. May you speak to each and every one of us. me out of the way and may you speak to your children. Father, I commit everyone into your heart, preaching of your word into your heart in Jesus name I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please be seated. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just also wanted to say that uh please remember me in prayers. I'm going to um I'm going to be away. about two weekends to North America. There is one of the major things that uh really I'm going to accomplish there. the Lord willing, one of the brothers, I don't know how many how many did you get got a chance to see the articles that we have on the website on the church, &gt;&gt; the missions reports, &gt;&gt; mission report, several of them. Yeah, you can see just a few. So many of you perhaps have not got it. Um but um you need to go read it. There is one article that was speaking about uh a brother that one of the first believers in Ethiopia and you know he moved to to Canada now actually he's one of the very first he's the very first couple he and and and um brother Habtom and his wife sister Misra were the very first to be uh wedded &gt;&gt; in the country of Ethiopia in our ministry. Of course, not the other denominations I'm talking about. So, uh so he he now moved to to North America and we got in touch recently and he has this burden and he's already trying to reach out to uh some of the of the other Ethiopian pastors. and introducing the message to them. So he has requested he requested me to come and maybe to help him and talk to them and you know evangelize them with this message. So I need you to remember that in prayer. Maybe we'll meet a few of his friends and ministers whoever, but we will also be going in several other churches. And so, please remember that in prayer. Amen. Are we ready for the word this morning? Are we ready for the word this morning? Amen. I I appreciate if you can sit still. It doesn't mean that you should not say amen. But sist still. If you want to go out, this is the right moment to do it. So that now you can be able to come back and sit through the suns. So this message we have read um from revelation 3 is speaking of the lad ra's a message to the ladian church age. to the angel of the L of the Lian churches. Brother, if you could give me that picture of the church ages. Um, so we have seven church ages. And if you look at Revelation and please I want you to please take. If you look at uh Revelation chapter 1, chapter 2 and chapter 3, these chapters [snorts] are talking about the seven gentile dispensation. You know this the gentile dispensation. The Bible speaks of it in Romans chapter 11. Romans chapter 11. He says that the Gentiles they were the wild olive branch. But you know the Jews were the original branch on the vine. The vine is Christ. The vine is the word. But I want you to follow this that the Jews did not be receive Christ. They rejected him. And we know that they are the ones who actually sold him to the Romans and the Romans crucified him. You remember when Pontius Pilate said, "Uh, but I find no cause. The man is not guilty." But then the Jews said, "No, don't worry about his blood. Let it be upon us." and our children. And so the man said, "Okay." And he washed his hands and he gave it he gave him to them and they crucified him. So by that single act, the Jews rejected Christ. Yet they were the original branch. They were given the initial opportunity to receive him. Like the scripture says, he came among his own but his own received him well. You know they rejected him and even later on we see the apostles are preaching among the Jews and the Jews rejected them. And you know Paul said it was good that the gospel be preached among you first seeing that you have rejected him. Lord we turn to the Gentiles. And from that moment on God be God changed his focus and his focus has been on the Gentiles and the Jews. They were left in the in the darkness. The Bible says they were blinded until today. Brother Shalom, the Jews do not receive Christ. The Jews cannot, you know, they cannot receive the revelation that we have today. But the the Gentiles are receiving it and enjoying it. He is a perfect type of Joseph of the Old Testament. how his brethren rejected him. But the the the Gentiles, the Egyptians, they received him. And the scripture says to as many as received him to them, he gave power to for them to become the sons of God. And so today I'm sharing with you on beyond the system. The reason why they rejected Christ was because of the system that they had at the time. They are Jewish systems, they are denominations. We will get into it as we continue. But then we see that the Bible in Romans 11, if you write it down please and you go and read the whole Romans 11, the Bible says that but blindness that has happened to Israel has happened in part. They are not going to be blind permanently. It is for a season. And the Bible say they will be blind until the fullness of the Gentiles come in. Praise God. Uh please open Romans with me. I know there are others who have never read about this. And it is important you see what I'm talking about. Brother, first give me Romans 11. And I just want that portion that speaks of that. Praise God. vers uh 20 25 the whole of it is good but we just for our thought we'll just take verses 25 brother Marvin you have to employ some speed now for I would not brethren that ye should be ignorant of this mystery Okay, look on the screen here because I want us to get to get it together. For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own concept. That blindness part is happen to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. Get back to the picture. So now you see when he says the fullness of the Gentiles, the fullness of the Gentiles comes through a generation of seven phases, seven ages, seven period of the of the church of Jesus Christ. So these are the ages that you see here. And you know Jesus has how many churches? 2 3 4 5 6 7. Come on, answer me now. One church. Jesus has one church. You remember which he told the disciples upon this rock upon what? The revelation. The rock here is not Jesus. The Catholics say that the rock is Peter and that's why they bu they buried they killed Peter. &gt;&gt; The Romans killed Peter and they buried him in in Vatican and they built a big building on top of it and they called it St. Peter's Basilica. &gt;&gt; This is in history. Go read it. And then they said Peter is the first pope. And because Jesus said Peter, &gt;&gt; you know, because his name was Simon. So you said that Peter meaning small stone and upon this rock, I will build my church. So they said because Peter means small stone, he is the rock that Jesus would build his church. And so they build that big building and they said, "So this is the church ecclesia &gt;&gt; which means the worldwide churches and that's why they killed in the dark ages many believers because they refuse to bow to this church system because this church system different from what Jesus had introduced. They said Peter was the first pope. But Peter was a married man. So I am more of a Catholic then than the pope. Said Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my father in heaven has revealed this to you. and upon this rock, meaning upon this revelation that you Peter have received of who I am, I will build my church. So the true church of Jesus is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ. Praise God. And so that was the church and that church would you know go through seven ages. &gt;&gt; It started at Pentecost and then the disciples came and uh and preached this message. Paul was the messenger the first church age. If you go to Revelation chapter one you will see the church ages. You know, he mentions them these where Listen now, now this is like a teaching, but I'm not a teacher. So, I just want you to follow. I just want you to follow through this. You know, these were cities historically. There were cities in Asia Minor. These are ancient cities. But when you see what the Bible said in the book of Revelation before he mentioned them, he told the angel spoke to uh John and told him [clears throat] the things which I'm about to tell you write. Okay. Praise God. Can we go to Revelation one and then we will come back to our subject. Praise God. Amen. Revelation chapter one. Um let me just see the verse that I wanted to read for you. Verses one. the revelation of Jesus Christ, which gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass. And he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant John. These are things which must shortly come to pass. So it was not it was in the future. And then he says vers three, blessed is he that readeth and they that bear hear the words of this prophecy. And keep those things which are written therein, for the time is at hand. John to the church seven churches which are in Asia. I told you these seven churches were seven churches in seven places in Asia. But the angel here is using these seven churches as symbols to the seven future church ages. Grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne. And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead, the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins and in his own blood. Praise God. Now I John N &gt;&gt; who was who also am your brother &gt;&gt; and companion in the in tribulation and in the kingdom of patience of Jesus Christ. I was in the island that is called Patimos for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. And I was in the spirit on the Lord's day, and he had behind me a great voice as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the be the first and the last, and that which thou seeest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches, which are in Asia, unto Ephesas, and Mannon, Pgamos, Theat Theura, Sadis, Philadelphia, and unto Ludicia. Could you read that portion, please? Praise the name of the Lord. And I just wish we could read the whole of it, but we don't have the time to do that. These are the seven church churches which were in Asia and uh you know like I said the these are all gentile places and of course chapter two and chapter three they now deals with the details of each church. But as you will quickly see each church was symbolizing a future age. another future or what you can say a future period of the same church. That's why you see those years there right from AD53 up to today 2025. Time has been moving. But you see, God has a timeline. God has seasons. God has times that he has predetermined before the foundation of the world. And for the times and the seasons of the Jewish church, we already know it by the 70 weeks of Daniel. You know, We've talked about that before and we know that the Jews in God's season and time they are remaining with three years and a half for God to deal with them. When Jesus was killed, the first portion of the seven years was finished when the Messiah was cut off. But after Jesus, follow me closely. After Jesus, &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in the book of Daniel that the Messiah was cut off, meaning killed, meaning removed. And he said not for himself. So he wasn't killed for himself. He was not guilty. He was killed for you and I. [screaming] So he was removed. He was cut off. But after he was cut off, the times of the Jews was paused. Now this why? Because they had rejected him. You know, he's a gentleman. Jesus can never force himself on you. He is a gentleman. He says, "I am on the door and I know. He that will open for me, I will come in. Would you open for Jesus this morning? Amen. Whatever prepare to speak right now, Jesus wants to speak to you. But he won't force you to hear it. Only if you can open your heart and be willing to hear and be willing to eat, I say he will feed you this morning. But then we see after he was cut off then the seasons of the Jews was paused. Not stopped but paused but there was remaining another season of three years and a half. Are you understanding what I'm saying? But also that three years and a half that God will deal with the Jews also he will deal with the Gentiles during the time that is called the great tribulation that will be after the rapture of the bride. Those churches that remained in the systems of man You know they will be left out. They will be left behind. And Christ will rapture his bride that has been made a word bride. But the other denominations they will remain behind. They will stay behind. We are not of those that are of Satan's age. [screaming] We will not remain behind. We will be changed in a twinkling of an eye. This motor shall put on immortality. But then we see the the the three years and a half will be the time of the tribulation. But also the Jews will receive their prophecy. They will receive their two prophets. One Moses, two Elijah. So they receive their Elijah that will restore back the word. And they receive the same word you are receiving today. They will believe the same Jesus you are believing today. They will receive the same Holy Ghost you are receiving today. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. But you see before that time, &gt;&gt; Amen. and after Jesus was cut off, up to the time when the decisions of the Jews will re will be restarted. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; You need to first enter into the revelation that I am in and then interpretation will become very easy. From the time the Messiah was cut off up to the time when the Jews received their prophecy because remember their time was Paul after Jesus died and then the time will be restarted after you know the the rapture their time the times of the Jews. will be restarted. So between this time and that time there is a space and that space what do you think he is doing? He is gathering a bride and that space the denominations cannot know anything about it. They don't know anything about it. People think we're just worshiping God. No, we are walking in the seasons and in the times. Part of the purpose of this message of the hour is to tell us what time we are living in, what season we are living in. We are not walking believing presumptuously. We know where we are. We know who we are. &gt;&gt; We know what is coming. We know where we are standing because the word [screaming] has has been open to us. Praise God. And now we know about the seven church ages. God gave this revelation to our prophet brother and he was able to see by the spirit of God the seven churches what they mean when they were [screaming] you know when brother wanted to draw this picture here as he was drawing it on the board you may never have heard of this the presence of God came and the Holy Spirit with his own pain he finished this image here. This is a supernatural image. You may think it is theology. This is not theology. [screaming] It is talking about our season, our times, where we are standing, what is coming. Where are we standing? We are right at the end of it all. Praise God. Amen. Brother Dixon, &gt;&gt; come and sit over here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Right be mama. I don't want you to miss anything. Praise God. Amen. And so here &gt;&gt; you see Paul Iranian Martin Luther and then the last one Elijah &gt;&gt; who actually happens brother Bham never said I'm the one but we know the last one is brother William who is the messenger of the last church age you know the first church age messenger he said let me remove this court so I can bring this properly. Praise God. The first church age messenger, he laid the first doctrines of the church. Paul the apostle, he preached to one God. He preached water baptism in Jesus name. He said no women preachers. He said the order in the church. He said everyone cannot speak tongues at the same time. He said one speak one interpret maximum three times in the church. And you know he taught all these foundational teachings what you call the principles of the doctrine of Christ. He laid it out and that was the basis of the teaching of the Christian church. But over the ages, you know, the devil came to eat it out and introduced system. And in each generation, God sent a message with a message to help the people to go beyond the system. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, in the beginning, God sent [screaming] Paul, he let the people beyond the in the second age. But let me tell you, in our age, I won't delay you with other ages. Let me talk to you about our age. God in our age, he has sent a messenger that would lead us with a revelation of the word, the last messenger to the last church age would also have the spirit of Elijah in you. The spirit of Elijah restores you back to the world. And when you are restored, [screaming] I will tell you what happens. When you are restored back to the word, you go beyond the systems. [screaming] You go beyond a denomination. What is your religious denomination? We are beyond all that. We are not a denomination because we have gone beyond a system. But for the systems of denomination, you know the Bible speaks of them in Ladyia in Revelation to the message 8 on vers 16. Oh, help me this morning so we can get this church. So then because thou art lukewarm now he's talking to the the system the church which was supposed to speak on behalf of Jesus. I may God help you church to first focus on the word this morning. Amen. Forget about anything else. Leave here as if this is the only moment you have. Amen. And so see this, you know, they they were to speak on behalf of God, but they became lukewarm. They could not stand on the word anymore. I'm talking about the denomination, the big religious systems. So they could not they were no longer hot. They were not not cold. So he said because you are not cold or hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth because you say I am rich and increased with good and have need of nothing. So this church system they are spewed out of the mouth of Jesus. There has been a change of administration. In this last age, the authority through which God once spoke shifted, he no longer speaks through the organized church systems of Amen. You know all these denominational walls, you know, once used to be the vessels of light. You know when you oh I wish I had the time but if I take the time then I will not be able to go through this. If you look at all these church agents when God sent these messengers when they died the people that were following their message they organized and they formed a religion. you know they they formed the Methodists, the Lutherans, the Anglicans that came out of it later and all these others and Presbyterians and you know they form organizations organizations organizations but at one point they were not an organization. They were the vessels [screaming] of light in their age. But you see they organized he spewed them out of his And you see now they have become barriers of the revelation of his word. God no longer uses the organized church. He no longer uses them as his voice to the nations. The same way the word moved from the Pharisees temple system You know, at first the the Pharisees, they were the ones with the word. They were the keepers of the law. But when Jesus came, they were no longer the ones. There was something that had come to take people beyond the system. So the same way the word moved from the Pharisees temple system, the word has once again in our day. It has changed its dwelling place. The word is no longer in creed. from creed to revelation. From systems of man to the spirit of the living God, from organization to the people called by his name. Let me tell you, we have been called out of systems. We have been called out of creeds. There used to be a time when we stand in the church and we begin to rehearse the creeds. Some of you maybe didn't but let me tell you God has changed administration. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we say here we have no creed but Christ. Christ has spewed them out of his mouth. They no longer carry his voice. They have their own voice but not his voice. But God has not been left without a voice in this thing. He has a voice. [screaming] We are now living in a time when the voice has moved from the church system to the [screaming] bride. The voice of God is not in a church system. The voice of God is in me. The voice of God is now in you. That voice now speaks through the bride of Jesus, &gt;&gt; the wordborn [screaming] church. &gt;&gt; You know, Revelation 22:17 says the the spirit and the bride says come. The voice of the spirit and the voice of the bride are now one. And the same for Christ is being revealed through his bride. That's why church I was telling you that the greatest mystery that has been finished in our day as is Christ in you. He's now ministering through you. That's why we have gone beyond the seasons of one man ministry. But you're still you're still here. in Africa and many other continents for people saying, "Oh, man of God, who are this ministry to do this?" You know, they still go to the man of God, they give all their money, they give all so he can prophesy to them and give them something so he can heal them so he can break their curses. People's hopes are still in a manner. We have gone beyond that church. The bride has gone beyond that. And that's why this message is equipping you to realize your place in Christ, to realize your position in the world. But not all who claim the name of Christ are of the bride. In every age, the word of the Lord address two groups. But only the elect receive the revelation and are transformed by that revelation. I want to show you something here in in in uh in the church age book a regime to the ages. Brother if you can put the quote up that's nice. From our studies, we have already learned that much of the revelation is totally misunderstood because we have not formally known that the the church spoken of and spoken to in this book does not refer to the pure ecclesia, the elect, the body of Christ, the bride. You know when I read here to the church of the ladian right. You remember reading that to the church of the church. So there is a church spoken to and a church spoken about. So he says, "The church spoken of and the church spoken to in this book refer to the pure ecclesia, the elect, the body of Christ, the bride. But it speaks to the entire body of people who are called Christians. whether they be true or merely nominal. As all Israel is not Israel, so all Christians are not Christians. So we learn that the church is made up of two vines. The true and the false. The two vines are motivated by two kinds of spirits. One has the Holy Spirit while the other is endued with the spirit of antichrist. But both claim to know God. Both prop to speak for God. Both believe certain very basic truths and differ on others. But we further learn that these two vines would grow side by side. Time shows what is in you. Time shows what is in you. That's why never be too quick to judge anyone because they have not matured to your level of revelation. Let us always show grace to everybody. Some people are quick to judge. Oh, those ones are chicken. We are the bride. Oh, those ones said they are not going to the rapture. We are going You don't know. Oh, papa, wait. Don't at [screaming] the time of the harvest you. Everybody's going to show their true colors. Amen. Because as long as the word is preached, it will show who you are. The word will reveal your identity. Praise God. Amen. And that's why in the denominations they are using the word. They may not have the full revelation of it but it will reveal who they are. So the false vine would not overcome and would not destroy the true vine. But then neither would the true vine be able to bring the false vine into a saving relationship with Jesus. Let us first pause here. I want us to get it. Two things here. The false vine has always one purpose to destroy the true vine. Not so when the why do you remove weeds in the garden? because it will reduce yield. It will the garden that's why we remove wheat. But Jesus in his garden he said there is no weedy. Let it grow together. [screaming] Why? because he has put something in his sin that he knows they [laughter] can never be destroyed by the false vine. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; But then hear this. Also the false vine, the true vine rather, the true vine. Even if she wanted, [screaming] she cannot bring the false vine. into a saving relationship with Jesus. As much as you have the whole truth, you can never change anyone who is not meant to say it. I've seen many times you fall down and you preach to somebody, you preach to them, you preach them. Have you ever preached to someone until you want to box their head? Get it, but they still try to go off. If someone is a false vine, you can never make them see. Why do you see it? Because you are the true vine. Why don't they see it? Because they are revealing who they are. But [screaming] we thank God. We can never be destroyed by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We learn the most amazing truth that the Holy Spirit could and would fall upon the ungenerated false vine Christians and manifested powerfully in various signs and wonders. Even as Judas had a definite ministry in the Holy Ghost, though he himself was pronounced to be a devil. And so with these principles in mind, we start to trust the church through various churches. Praise God. Just follow closely here. &gt;&gt; The birth of the church was at Pentecost. &gt;&gt; As the first Adam was given a bride fresh from the hand of God and was undeiled for a brief span. So was Christ. The last Adam given a bride pure and fresh at Pentecost. And she remained separate and undeiled for some time. How long this continued, we don't know. But one day, even as if was tempted and seduced by Satan. So the church, now remember, the church was was supposed to be the bride of Christ. The church was birthed at Pentecost. Are you following me? And it was supposed to be the wife of Christ, just as Adam also had a wife called Eve, the woman. But you see, she was virtuous for a space of time until the serpent came and her. In the same way when the church of Jesus was b. Oh my. May you may you get this. You see the birth the church of the the the wife of Adam was was birthed out of the ribs the side of Adam. In the same way the church of Jesus was also birthed out of the side of Jesus. on the cross. When they pierced him, blood and water came out that birthed the church. And we see that church at Pentecost. You see, when the life came in, when the life came in, that became the church. But now this was the supposed to be the wife of Jesus. If you get it, say amen. But in the same way, we don't know how long he would stay when he is not contaminated by the entrance of the antichrist spirit. And this is the spirit of the antichrist. Where ye have heard that it should come even now is already in the world. That's first John 4:3. And Jesus said concerning his bride in the first age. I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast left thy first love. Remember therefore from whence thou had fallen and repent. Now Revelation two, remember thou where thou hast fallen and repent. &gt;&gt; The church was in that first age already a fallen woman. I don't know whether you missed it or whether you got it. It was a perfect church. But we are reading in Revelation 2:4 where he is now saying remember where thou has fallen and repent. Who is he talking about? to the church in Ephesus, the very first age. The church was already a fallen woman. Like Eve, she fell. As Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam, even now had Satan seduced the church at that time, the bride of Christ before the marriage supper of the Lamb. Give me that picture again, brother. You see, the marriage supper of the lamb does not take place in the in Ephesians. The marriage supper takes place after Lord this year. But now we are reading in Revelation two when he's referring to the church in Ephesians and he's saying you are fallen. Remember where you fail and repent. So he has already spewed that church out of his mouth. Just like just like the church, the woman, Eve, the serpent came to her just before Adam would come to take her in the same way. The church in Ephesians fell before the marriage supper of the Lord. Hallelujah. And what specifically was in our midst that caused the fall? Revelation 2:6. Everybody say the deeds of the Nicolantes. Already that first age had turned from following the pure word of God. They turned from God's demand of a church absolutely dependent upon him depending entirely upon God to fulfill his word from start to finish apart from human government and they turn to Nicolantism. By the way, is organizing a human government within the church, which is all governments do, legislate for the people. That's Nicolantinism. They have boards that lead the church. Have you heard of something called senote? They're the ones that lead the church. the curer that kind of hierarchy. They did exactly what Israel did. They took the expediency of human government instead of the word and the spirit. Now here God is addressing both vines. He's addressing the true vine and the false vine. The wheat and the tears, the wise and the foolish virgins, both growing together in the same field. They bear the same name. They claim the same relationship, but their fruits tell the difference. Therefore, when we speak of going beyond the system, we mean that the voice of divine leadership has moved. from these systems of manmade religion to the bride of the world. Let me tell you church to those of you especially those of you who are new to the message this message is not a system of religion. God has called us from all the man-made systems of We are not part of any denomination. We are the bride of the word. [clears throat] Tell your neighbor, the bride of the word. God is not using the big denominations of our to bring forth his word. He is using the word born pride. Amen. And you know she has this pride has taken his name. This bride has taken his nature. That's why if you don't have his nature yet be born again. Receive his nature. [screaming] Before you get the Holy Spirit, you can never be the bride. May God help us. The organized church they just carry his name but they have rejected his word. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible you know you know we have we hear them saying well I'm full gospel but when you see the full gospel it doesn't reflect what is here. But the bride, though she has been rejected by the world, has received his voice. And as it was in every age, the elect bride becomes the living oracle of God. I am the living oracle of God. through whom God speaks today. Do you know God is no longer speaking through a one-man ministry? Now, let me wake you up a little bit. God is no longer using one prophet all over the world. There has been change over administration. It's now a many membered body. God is using each of us the same. Because we are the bride. You know when you come to adoption, you are not talking about one person over the others. You are talking about everyone, every member of the body. Praise God. Theian systems, they have rejected the word. They are spewed out. That means they no longer speak for God. They have become their own voice. But God's voice has not been silenced in this day. It has just changed its channel. The voice of Christ now speaks through me, through you, through every individual. [screaming] For the bride and the spirit are saying the same thing. The shift is not from from Christ to the bride. No, no. But but you see it is Christ revealed [screaming] in his bride is revealed through the bride. It is through the bride that Christ is speak &gt;&gt; the authority of Christ. and anointing are now manifested through his bride. Christ is sealed ahead. Hallelujah. The bride is the his body on earth works under his direction and anointing as my father has sent me. He says even so send I you through the the Holy Spirit the power of the Holy Ghost. The bride continues his work. What is the work of Christ? What was he doing on earth? He was saving the lost, healing the sick, interceding for souls, declaring the word. I have a question for you. Are you the voice of Christ today? What are you doing to show that you are that voice? What was Christ doing? He was healing the sick, extending mercy to the lost, interceding for souls, declaring the word, speaking the word. And this means we are supposed to do the same same thing. is the head. We are the body. We are his representatives on us today. We are walking in hisstead. &gt;&gt; You know what the pope says he is? The pope says he is the one instead of the son of God. But he's taking the bless of the bride. We are here to offer mercy. We are here to lead souls to salvation. We are here to lay hands on the sick. and to continue the work of the ministry of Christ which is the work of redemption. We must remember he said all power is given to me on earth and in heaven and the Holy Spirit was not sent to replace Christ but the Holy Spirit was sent to continue his work. Now I want to take this to a certain corner. Go to the book of Colossians chapter 2. Chapter 2 8. Look at look at that. It says, "Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power." Amen. Can you please read that again from verses 8 to 10? The Bible says we are complete in him. Christ came in word form through prophetic messages in our generation. to restore our faith back again. We have witnessed Christ's coming in word form. Listen, people are believing for him to come. We believe he will come. By the way, we believe the corporate body will come back. He has already come. Hallelujah. 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 says that he will descend with a shout and a voice to descend with a shout and a voice and a trumpet and that shout is the message the word. Christ has already come in word formal through the prophetic ministry and has manifested his bride. Let me say this. He has manifested me &gt;&gt; in me rather. &gt;&gt; If you look at Romans 8:19, very wonderful scripture. He says, "For the earnest expectation of the creature waitth for the manifestation of the sons of God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't need to turn to it, brother. For the for the honest expectation of the creature. waits for the manifestation of the sons of God. Did you hear that? &gt;&gt; Let us read it together. Brother, do we have it here? It says, "For the unex expectation of the creature, when we talk about creatures, &gt;&gt; we talk about anything that was created. When we talk about creatures, we talk about anything that was created. Be it thrones, be it powers, be it you know uh you know all the creation, all creation fell from glory. That's why today animals eat human beings. Animals were not supposed to eat human beings. Eat human beings. That's why you know people get demons in them. Those demons are not supposed to enter people. That's why people suffer. That's why you know people become very poor and they have they have nothing to eat and they're suffering. That's not the purpose and the intent of God. The purpose and the intent of God is that we are sons and we are here to show forth his glory and I want to finish with this thought. So just stay with me now. So the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation. I was just looking up this word in Greek. The creature is waiting for the manifestation. What is manifestation? In Greek they call it apocalyppsis apocalypsis which means to unveil to reveal to unveil. &gt;&gt; Where is little David? I saw you David somewhere. Come up here. I want to demonstrate this for you. So I want you to understand. I want to show you the purpose of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Stand right here, brother. You You want to squat down? Scroll down. Yes. So yeah. Yeah. I know you're physically fit. &gt;&gt; So this is what is happening. The sons of God before the revelation of the word they are veiled in defeat and because they they are still veiled. They don't know who they are. The creatures are suffering. The people are suffering in sin, in troubles, in sickness, in problems. Their solution is you but you cannot help them if you are still veiled. Many believe many sons of God are still veiled. The purpose of the message of Yahweh is to unveil the bride to unveil you. The earnest expectation of the creature is for the manifestation is for the unveil of the sons of God. But you are still veiled now and the denomination is still veiled. God bless you. Until the message come. Are you following me now? Before the message comes, there is no unveiling to take place. We don't even know who we are. But after unveiling, after the word has come, you know what the word has said as emphasize this these words in 1 Peter chapter 2. It says, "But ye are a chosen generation. We [screaming] are a royal priesthood. We are holy nation, a peculiar people." By the way, whenever I read this, I I just receive it in my spirit myself. that ye should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness, out of denominationalism, out of the systems of man into his marvelous [screaming] light which in times past we are not a people, but now we are a people of God which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. At first I used to think that I was a son of my father whatever my family was going through I thought I have to go through whatever defeated them I thought it has to defeat me and you know sometimes I've seen people many times they begin to console themselves because of what they going through in their family you find them you know you know, then you begin consoling yourself according to where you came from. But the purpose of the message of Yahweh is to unveil you to reveal you. You have been hidden all this while, but now you have been unveiled. The word has revealed who you are. The the victory of the believer is realizing her true potential is realizing her true identity. that my identity &gt;&gt; is not in the failures or the circumstances that are negative around me or what people have spoken about them. There are so many people who are always offended at what people speak about them. You are too short. You are too ugly. You are too small. You are too far. So when people hear those comments, you can maybe be one of them here. You can hold something against somebody for years. Why? Because they said, "I'm too small. I'm too tiny. I'm too dark. I'm too bright. I'm too this." What you're seeing is not me. What you are seeing is this piece of flesh. which is not a part of me really. This came from the ground is going to go back to the ground. But I [screaming] who am I? I am a son of God and I actually came from God and I go back to God. That's my identity in Christ. So what defines me is what the word says. So I am a chosen generation. I am a royal priesthood. I am a holy nation. I am special. Can you imagine says you are special? Peculiar means you are different. You're not like everybody [screaming] else. So I I want to re ree it to you tonight. You are not like everybody else. When I mean you, I am talking to the bride. We are not like the Catholics. We are not like the Anglicans. We are not like the Muslims. We are not like any denomination. We have been called out of all that system [screaming] to come out of her my people. Where are we right now? The Bible says we are seated in heavenly blessings with Jesus Christ. Praise God. The unveiling of who you are &gt;&gt; automatically connects you to the revelation &gt;&gt; and understanding that brings you to the to your personal divine purpose. I want to show you a scripture here that really interested me. Acts 194 And there were seven sons of onekever, a Jew, and chief and chief of the priests, which did so. And the and the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus, I know, and Paul, I know, but who are you? and a man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on the in was leaped on them and overcame them. This is very significant and prevailed against them so that they fled out of [screaming] the house naked and wounded. &gt;&gt; Praise God. When let let me tell you something first. When a son of [screaming] God speaks, &gt;&gt; all creatures know they must obey. They must respond. But these spirits, these creatures in this man could not recognize the authority of these vagabond Jews. So and many believers today who are either not who they claim to be or they just have not been they are still veiled and therefore they are overcome by faith. Look at this scenario which we have read. When this man when this man when this man came and begin be began to cast out this demons by these demons are creatures. Did you know that they were angels before they fallen angels? But you see creatures are meant to recognize authority and a son I'm I'm giving you a key here. A son once he's adopted he speaks on behalf of the father whether it is the father the son who has spoken or the father it is almost like the son that's why when Jesus was being baptized the voice from heaven spoke this is my beloved Here ye him sir, not here ye God, but hear ye because he's a son. Now listen to me. When you feed on the word and you grow, you recognize who you are. You are a son of God. Bible says, "Beloved, now are we the sons of God. It does not yet appear what we shall be. But when he comes, we shall be like him. When you recognize you are a [screaming] son, all the authority of the father is in you as a son. You can speak just like the father can. You can command just like the [screaming] father can. You can create like the father can create. You can change like the father can change. You can close. you can open. [screaming] That's why he said you I've given you power to bind and power to lose. And in every generation, in every church ages, throughout the seven church ages, in every one of them, he says to the overcomers, to him that overcometh, I will give him to eat of tree of life. To him that will overcome, I I will sit with him on my throne. Now listen. Amen. They are overcomers. You cannot overcome without fighting. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are fighting in our age? We are fighting soft living. We are fighting coldness. We are fighting lukewarmness because this age is a age of people who want to live softly. That's why they don't even find time to pray even when it comes to church before the preacher begins to preach very busy looking at the time. It is a generation of people who have pity on themselves &gt;&gt; always you want to consult yourself. You want things easy. This is the age we are living in. And the devil has really taken over our generation through AI through technology through social media. Young people are swept out of their feet. And to overcome in this generation is difficult. But remember these are our demons to fight and overcome. But there are those who are going to be overcome. But there are those who have predestinated that will never be overcome with all the immoral demons that have been sent out in our generation. I mean you can mention them one by one. They are killing younger people by thousands and millions. It is almost very rare to find now a virgin and the devil begins to deceive you and to tell you it is not possible. But you don't know what you're talking about. God still [screaming] has the 7,000 somewhere. God has sealed the elect. God has seed that he [screaming] will always preserve. Amen. And even those that he takes, &gt;&gt; even those the devil takes, he thinks I will finish them, he has already taken them in the web of his system. You know, like all these universities. When young people go there, it's like they have gone to Brussels. The devil takes them to his system and he and and he entangles them, cumbers them with a with a with a with a with a with a with a you know those immoral living and the younger people think everybody else is like this. So I'm not special. You are special. You have come here for for me to tell you you are special. You are not like those from Saturn's age. [screaming] God has a bride. I am laboring this morning to show you that there is a bride that God has that out of this [screaming] generation, he will preserve her for himself. Hallelujah. No matter what the devil [screaming] does, there will be that one. that will have [screaming] amen voice of God in our generation. Their voice [screaming] will be the voice of God. Their nature will be the nature of God. Their life will be the life of God. You know what? They are brought here not to be defeated. They are brought [screaming] here to defeat every spirit of Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But you see these uh people we see in in Acts chapter 19 just came and were trying to speak and trying to cast out these creatures and the creatures said you're saying in the name of Jesus whom Paul speaks about all right I recognize Jesus I recognize Paul but for you I Don't I don't I don't know you. Imagine when demons don't recognize him. That's what happens. Let me tell you, brother. When they did not recognize them, they quickly leaped on them. And the Bible says overame [screaming] them. Brother, come on. You see, let me tell you, demons are overcoming you because they don't recognize who you are. &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome, you need to recognize who you argue yourself. Who are you? You have to know I am a son of God. I am born of God. Yes, I am in this body of flesh. He's pulling me here, pulling me there, pulling me there. [screaming] But that does not define me. What defines me is what the word says about me. If the word says I'm an overcomer, I must overcome. If the word said I'm I'm a peculiar person, then I'm a peculiar people. I am not a commoner. I am different. I'm special. I am here to show the devil. I must overcome. I must overcome. What are you wrestling with, my brethren? Just recognize who you are. Get the true identity of who you are. When you speak to Satan and then devil [screaming] leave right now, he will not question, he will not question. He'll just say, "Okay, all right, sir." And he will take his name. But but but these boys as they're trying to exercise their authority said, "But who are you? &gt;&gt; We don't know you." They leaped on them. overcame them, prevailed against them, and they fled out naked and wounded. Don't think about casting out demons. I'm talking about you overcoming because those demons, don't think about them being in someone. They are looking after you every day. every single day of your life. You have to overcome them. Now we are called unto manifestation. Uh apocalypsis that is manifestation and unveiling revealing of who we are so that we can live our divine purpose. to to do what? [screaming] What's our purpose? To destroy the works of the devil. We who the bride [screaming] not the system. The bride the systems already are broken. But the bride is being built up. The bride is realizing who she is. Let me tell you, brother, feed on the word. I can ask you how many here read the message how many read the message how many listen to the message if you don't you are not feeding on the word and you're wasting time you have no different with the Catholic who is saying hail Mary mother of god bless no difference feed on the word because if you feed on the word, you will realize who [screaming] you are. And when you realize who you are, then you are going to live a life of purpose. You see, 1 John 3:8 says, "He that committeth sin is of the devil. For the devil sinnth from the beginning, for this purpose the son of God was manifest. This is now to make manifest The Greek word here is fenuro that he might destroy the works of the devil. [screaming] &gt;&gt; He Amen. He was made manifest. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; When you [screaming] are unveiled, you will be made manifest to the world whereby wherever you go, demons will recognize [screaming] who you are. They will take off at the mere mention of who you are. Because remember when you mention the father hallelujah demons know but if the son is really a son and the mention of the name of the son [screaming] demons will recognize that that's why the bible says he has given him a name above every name that the mention of the name of Jesus every knee [screaming] shall every should confess that Jesus Christ is lord But remember, it's not only about the person Jesus. Jesus is the head. &gt;&gt; You are the [screaming] body. So wherever you go, the devil should recognize who you are. You are the representation of [screaming] him. Hallelujah on earth. As long as you are out of the system. Amen. You are in a system of the world. Hallelujah. Praise God. In a message adoption, let me try to bring it to a close. He says this goes to all the world and I'm reading it now. It was spoken in 1960. So listen, I ask any historian to come and bring to me any text of scripture or any history, any vers of history that ever showed that any Protestant anybody was ever baptized in the name of the father, son, holy ghost until the Catholic Church ordained it in the sin council. Praise God. Father, Son, Holy Ghost is a false, bogus Catholic dogma and not a Christian baptism. [screaming] Luther brought it out from the Catholic church with catechism. We adopted it and come on. But then he says, "But [screaming] this day is a day of manifestation of the sons of God." When the mystery, you see how manifestation now comes in? When the mystery that has been hid since the foundation of the [screaming] world is to be made known. So when those mysteries be made known, &gt;&gt; the sons of God will come will be made manifest. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So now the message is not a bunch of doctrines. It's not legalism. Some people are still there. Let me tell you, we've moved on. The message is not a set of rules. Don't do this. Don't do that. You receive the message with mechanical faith, intellectual faith, then you cannot even be unveiled. You have to understand the this message of the hour is the revelation of the mysteries. Which mysteries? Actually, Revelation 10:7 says, "The mystery, what mystery of God, all those mysteries are in that mystery." &gt;&gt; Are you following me? Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the voice of the seventh day, when he begins to sound, &gt;&gt; everybody say it with me, &gt;&gt; the mystery of God will be fixed. So the seventh angel message comes to finish the mystery. &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27 Even the mystery [screaming] which has been hid from ages, generations, but now has been made [screaming] manifest. Unto who? To his saints? To the bride. Not the church system, but to the bride [screaming] which is Christ in you. the hope of glory. The hope of glory. [screaming] So that's where the glory is. That's where we can make manifest. Amen. After the mystery has been revealed. So now we know. Let me put it let me break it down. The mystery of God is a revelation of Jesus Christ. So you know when you know him then you realize you are a part of him. You understand? He's the head. You are the body. So now you realize it's no more just about doctrine. It's the unveiling of the bride. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Go right back to Genesis to the original. What is it? Now the world and nature is groaning, crying, everything is moving. word for the manifestation of the sons of God. When true sons of God, born sons, filled sons speak and their word is backed. that is 1960. So I can today say it is here. Hallelujah. Set this [screaming] mountain. Let it be so. Brother, I desire so and so. A certain thing that be done. I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. And then you say, I give it to you in the name of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And then he says there is a manifestation. Oh brother, my crops are burning up out yonder. I don't have any rain. And then I say I send you rain [screaming] in the name of the Lord. There she will come. Hallelujah. The creature is waiting for growing all nature waiting for the manifestation of the sons [screaming] of God. God ordained it at the beginning. Amen. He gave man the domain on earth. The domain on earth is yours. Is mine is yours. Is [screaming] yours is yours. So what am I saying? You have to be unveiled. &gt;&gt; The purpose of preaching is so you can know who you are. It's so you can be unveiled. So the veil can be removed. The veil can be removed. Amen. And the more it is removed, then you realize, hey, you mean I have that much [screaming] power? You mean I have that much authority? Oh, then a brother will come to you. Brother, I'm struggling with this spirit. I don't want it. And then you'll say for sure yes. He said okay you spirit I command you to leave him now and it will go. Hallelujah. A brother came here and he told me gave me this testimony. He said pastor you you you know I think it's from somewhere. He said you you know last time he came in the camp and he came specifically to me for prayer. He said I need prayer. I need a job. I said when do you want a job? &gt;&gt; Amen. Because pastor Miranda and just preach to us who we are right. Amen. We a part of God. The logos has a part. So I told the brother, "So which job do you want? How much do you want to earn and when do you need it?" He listed everything. I said, "In the name of Jesus Christ, I give it to you." [laughter] At the he asked for it, how much he wanted to ask, when he wanted to get it, it worked out 100%. and he came back here I think in one of the meetings here to give me the testimony where we don't run testimony shows and everything but you know he came and gave me the testimony and he said now pastor there is a problem in that job now I need to be h promoted I told him when [laughter] he said when I said I give it to you in Jesus Just one or two days he called me he said I've been promoted look we all have that why if you're a son of God if you're a son of God I remember there was a season here you know the presence of God came down and we're asking you know the spirit of God asked many of us whatever you need you shall have it if you need clothes, you'll have them. So, how many need clothes? Everybody raise up your hands. All right, receive the clothes. I I received testimonies until I got tired. Clothes after clothes after clothes. If you shall say to this mountain, be removed from this place and be planted out yonder. It shall happen. Why? Not because you are presuming or thinking, but you are just speaking by authority. &gt;&gt; As a son of God, [screaming] praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that? Amen. Praise God. Let us stand on our feet. I'm I'm going to speak a part part two of this on Wednesday, the Lord willing, and take you on another phase of that. Show you how being bound by the system can make you fail to understand who you are. And the spirit of God in this end time is calling on us. Come out [screaming] of h people. Be not partakers of our sins. Praise God. Amen. I'd like us to sing He Made a Way. If the musicians can come. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You made a way to make room. You made a way.

So let's just bow our heads right [music] now and pray. Lord Jesus, we commit our brother Andrew as he's going to be traveling today, Lord, to take that long journey tomorrow. We commit him into your hands. Lord, not only for traveling masses, but also for protection while therement and put grace around him, Father. and and as you've kept him the rest of the week months and continue to [music] keep him there fast for the glory of God and also while he's away you may keep his family bless him Lord and his in Jesus name amen there is a a request here um for [music] and I'm happy whenever I get things like this &gt;&gt; that means you're listening Uh there's someone who is saying pastor you spoke about the death of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and he said that there was an end of the Jews life and he is looking for the bride. If I may ask for the Jews their life is not counted by God. till when he will come back. Please help me and explain more about it. First of all, you misunderstood me. I did not say that when Jesus Christ died, it marked the end of Jewish life. I said that after the death of Jesus, the times the seasons of the Jews was over meaning for God to work with them. He blind them. That's why they did not recognize that Jesus was the Messiah. So as far as God is concerned and as far as faith is concerned, God no longer works with the Jews from that time. Because remember with the Jews, he always deals with them as a nation with us as individuals. And so the Bible says in Romans 11 that they were blinded for your sake. until the fullness of the Gentiles become the fullness of the Gentiles will be coming and it will be marked. I already here actually but it will be marked the end of it will be marked by the rapture. After the rapture, then the two witnesses will go to the Jews. Now God will begin to work with them again. You know, they will be they will go there for the calling of the 144,000 years. The Bible talks about those Jews who will be saved and and the number is 144,000 Jews. 12,000 out of each tribe. Is that 12,000? Yes. So uh that will be the one that will be saved because remember there 12 tribes but out of each tribe will come 12,000 but you see they will they will come to the knowledge of the truth by the witness of those two witness. Right now generally God is no longer dealing with it. I've quite a few Jews myself. They are just most of them areists even a few are you know following the Judaism. Yeah. So but because they're blinded they're really blinded. So that's that's what I meant. I hope that it explains it. Well, God bless you. We'll be here once again on uh on on Wednesday. Please come on time, 6 p.m. Wednesday. And we are we are we scheduled to have a coup's meeting at 4, but with some traveling and all that. Let's just have 30 minutes of resting and then at 2:30 whoever will be here at 2:30 I'll start. If you know you you a couple please come or if you are married but your husband is at home please come.
