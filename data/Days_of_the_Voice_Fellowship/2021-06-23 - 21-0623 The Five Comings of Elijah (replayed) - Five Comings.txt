Description:
Most Christians realize it is of utmost necessity for Jesus Christ to return, but why would Elijah need to come first? John the Baptist foreran the first coming of Jesus. If it were necessary for Elijah to come to prepare the hearts of the people to receive the 
Messiah when He came 2,000 years ago, would it be necessary for Elijah to come again before Jesus returns the second time? If so, what is the “spirit of Elijah” and how many times will God use this specific anointing? This topic is of vital importance because if there is an Elijah promised, then his ministry and Message must be recognized and embraced

to listen to america a bit later greetings to you in the name of our lord jesus christ we are happy to be able to speak to you today and we are coming to bring to you the message of the hour yes as many of you already know we are living in the end time where most of the signs that the bible speaks of have already come to pass [Music] at a time when coronavirus has already gone all over the world and many people are dying yeah corona virus i don't know surely we cannot doubt that we are living at the time that was promised to be the end salah jesus christ is about to come back the second time and rupture his bride yes waiting right away jesus christ according to faster than chapter four and yet there will be a catching away of the bride we are at that time he's coming back anytime soon and the question is to look with the yaki again we are bringing to you the end time message the message that would prepare the bride of jesus christ for the coming of the lord and if you you take your time and follow us closely i believe that the lord will reveal this to you to your heart we're gonna take isaiah chapter 61 verse one to two yeah the spirit of the lord god is upon me because the lord has anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind up the broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to the captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god to comfort all that morn [Music] now this was a prophecy by prophet isaiah speaking of the coming of the lord if you notice when jesus christ came the the he was given the book uh the prophet isaiah's in the temple and this is the exact scripture he went through a baby i want us to first compare this prophecy of isaiah with the place that is is written in the book of luke chapter four where jesus the bible records that he took the book and read and we want to see what he read compared to what was written in the book of isaiah and there was delivered unto him the book of prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written the spirit of the lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and the recovering of sight to the uh the blind to set a liberty to them that are breezed to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it to again to the minister and sat down and all the eyes of all of them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say unto them listen to what he said this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and capitalism if there was something that jesus knew how to do was to allocate his place in the scripture you notice when they took the prophecy of isaiah he was able to read the exact path that was speaking about his first coming at that time and he left out the other part that was speaking about he's coming but this time the second coming albertan [Music] if you look at verse 2 of isaiah where we read he says to proclaim the acceptable year of the lord and the day of vengeance of our god and to comfort all that morning yes but jesus did not finish this verse [Music] in luke 14 in luke chapter 4 rather verse 19 he says to preach the acceptability of the lord and he puts a full stop ow lukas miranda and then he said he crossed the book he said this that you have had in your ears is the first coming of jesus was to declare the acceptable year of the lord it was to preach the good tidings to the make and letter and of course we were all slaves being that we were born in sin so the death of jesus christ on the cross declared the year of freedom for all the human race as long as they would believe and we noticed that that was all that he did the first coming he died for us on the cross and that was the the reason why he came back and so he left out that other part which says and the day of vengeance the coming of the lord that prophecy is fulfilled but in part he never wants anyone to miss his coming uh jesus man memphis disaster and that is why before he comes he sends elijah the prophet celestino commenter and so we want to talk to you about the coming of elijah in connection to the coming of the lord and we'll just go straight away to the prophecy of the coming of elijah in malachi chapter four he says behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord and they shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest i come and smite their earth with the curse elijah is going to come before the before the coming of the great and dreadful day christianity today believes this verse but they believe it only in the past that your it is already fulfilled through the ministry of john the baptist and you know how he wrestled and fought jezebel had the spirit of elijah on him so we can say that elisha was a man with the spirit of elijah memphis something i should also notice after elijah the dish bite the rest of them is really the spirit of elijah on a man this prophecy in malacca and those will be the two witnesses that will uh awaken or their message will call out the 144 thousand jews we know the one that is going to come we know that the last one the fifth one will go to the jews it says behold i'll send you elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the lord so these two elijahs are going to come each one is going to come before the dreadful day of the lord and the other is going to come before the the great day of the lord now we can say that the first coming of jesus was great but we cannot call it dreadful jesus christ it was a day of joy destiny of 3 verse 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life that was a great day yeah it would be two women i would like us to track it down to luke chapter 1 verse 13. okay in the mighty fella says but the angel said unto me to him fear not the carriers for thy prayer is hard and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a son and thou shalt call his name john and thou shalt have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the lord and shall drink neither wine no strong drink and it shall be filled with the holy ghost even from his mother's womb and many of the children of israel shall he now listen to this shall he turn to the lord their god and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of elias to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready our people prepared for the lord foreign it says when he comes elijah is going to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children number one and then number two he says the hearts of the children to the fathers memphis and then he says now let's read it this way that i'll send you elijah before the great day of the lord and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children uh can we now read when you read verse five do not mention dreadful day for them to understand he says that i'll send you elijah before the coming of the great day of the lord yes and if you notice in the book of luke and not lucas marath like dominic no the bible says that john's ministry was going to turn the children of israel's hearts to the lord their god is ministry was to the jews the fathers of the law to to turn their hearts or to introduce jesus christ to them according to the bible it only prepared the coming of the messiah the people's hearts for the coming of the lord whenever we talk about john remember the word prepare actually even in isaiah 4 4 40 verse 3 says the voice of him that christ in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god is when john introduced jesus christ behold the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world his ministry stopped there foreign and therefore what we are trying to say is that the prophecy of malachi speaks of john but in part isaiah called it the day of vengeance of our god. i called it the dreadful day of the lord in other places it says the day that shall ban us as an oven [Music] you see so that is not the first coming of jesus christ and notice on verse six he also says and the heart of the children to their fathers so this one that would come before the uh the the dreadful of the lord would turn the hearts of the of the children to their fathers and by the way when he says fathers to children or children to fathers this is not meaning father-son relationships the first fathers to children only is indicating the fathers of the law the jews the pharisees and the disease who were under the law that john's ministry would turn them uh or would introduce jesus christ to them now yeah about [Music] and the heart of the children to their fathers this one is indicating the children of god those who have received the holy ghost from the day of pentecost they are called children you are the child of god the bible says when we receive the spirit of christ in our hearts we cry our father another coming of elijah before the second coming of jesus christ remember the coming of elijah is always connected to the coming of the lord yes if you notice the people who received uh elijah's ministry as john they also and his disciples asked him saying why then say the scribes that elias must first come and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come and restore all things but i say unto you that elias has come already and they knew him not but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the son of man suffer of them then the disciples understood that he spoke unto them of john the baptist [Music] the disciples had watched jesus at the moment of transfiguration and they saw him transfigured with moses and with elijah now how moses was representing those that were dead in christ and elijah was representing those that are alive and remain [Music] s as i mentioned to you a while a while ago uh chapter four he says that um at the at the sounding of the last trump of god the dead in christ shall rise fast then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together and we meet the lord in the air [Music] when the disciples saw jesus transfigured in that cloud with moses and so the disciples received the revelation that this was the messiah that was standing right before them elijah to come before you and here you are where is elijah according to the prophecy and now uh [Music] elijah had come and that was john but they had missed him he had come and gone and they had missed him but when he says and jesus answered and said unto them elias truly shall first come together [Music] and so he was speaking of the elijah that was going to come before his second coming before the messiah's second coming the dreadful day of the lord and you remember that the elijah that came before the great day of the lord who was john did not restore he only prepared them okay but here we see a new word this man upon whom the spirit of elijah would be will not uh will do more than what john did he will restore all things means to bring back something and so this elijah coming before the second coming of jesus christ his ministry will be concentrating on restoring all things and what are those things that are going to be restored for restoring those things this is what i want us to talk about the purpose [Music] exactly what he has promised he must fulfill you born with me and remember he said he's going to come and take a church or rapture a church without sport or wrinkle washed in the blood of the lamb a spotless church yeah the bible says let us be glad and rejoice for the marriage of the lamb is come and his wife has made herself ready there is only one there's only one thing that would make that bride ready it's going to be a special ministry but it's not best in any denomination that's not going to start any denominations but that ministry will speak nothing but the word of god yeah yes god has always worked that way from the days of noah but canosa when he said no he didn't send him out of any of the established denominations of that time but noah had that saved the lord do you know the day you are living my friends it's later than you think the coming of the lord is here yeah the message of restoration is already here yes elijah is come elias method remember is coming to the church to restore the hearts of the children back to their fathers listen we are the children of god and yeah exactly we the church christian i'm not talking about denominations i'm talking about the church the body of jesus christ all over the world every denomination has its own doctrine don't drink it the way for us to know that he is that who was spoken of again because the bible says that in the end time there shall be many false prophets they shall perform many signs many wonders many miracles lying wonders this elijah in the end time will be a word prophet and his ministry will be restoring us yes you have many instructors in christ but you don't have [Music] [Music] just like as you know in taipei israel left egypt but not all those that left egypt went to the promised land [Music] many died in the desert so they were you know the word church means they're called out ones to be the christians so we are all called out of the world believe jesus christ god has the today is he that will hear the message of this anytime elijah yes this message will prepare them for the coming of our lord jesus christ this message will uh you know cut off every man-made dogma creed all traditions and restore them back again to the foundations and the principles of the word of god yet there is no ministry that has has been spoken of in this generation and in the generations before us than the ministry of william marion branham and many have said whatever they had to say about the ministry [Music] but we've been convinced that that is the ministry that fits the scripture according to the prophecy of malachi 4. [Music] [Music] um if you want to know more about the ministry of the man you can write to us or let us know we will be sure to send you books or to answer your questions um but i'd like to go ahead and show you those things that this ministry [Music] b well praise the lord uh i just believe that that was a blessing to you uh if you can switch on your videos that would be wonderful that would be nice uh now we are planning to by the grace of god of course we recorded a few videos after that if you want to uh get to them we had a video on water baptism also one on uh the uh modesty and women preachers and several other videos as well as [Music] uh the one on godhead now uh you might not have watched that and if you want to watch it just type in on youtube the message site without leaving a space the message site and then it will come up and you'll be able to get those videos but uh now for our fellowship here uh i know that there might be some with questions on this subject or on this specific subject maybe something that has been said now or something that has say has been said uh previously in the fellowship in the church here uh or the church that you attended before on this subject of of uh elijah or the coming of a legend or generation uh i think this is a good opportunity for us to have a few minutes uh a few minutes i know that there might be some people with patients even those that are already believers and maybe it's something that you want to ask maybe not for you but for someone else i think this is a good opportunity for us to be able to do that um and before you do that before you ask your questions something that i want to make to make uh you know known to us is that when we talk about the coming of elijah we are not really the purpose is not for us to talk about the man elijah or the man who will have a spirit of elijah upon him but the purpose is to talk about a ministry which is going to come to prepare the people for the coming of the lord because everybody in the church world knows about the coming of jesus they all talk about the coming of jesus christ and they believe in the coming of our lord jesus christ but they do not know that he will come and they will know nothing about it and he is coming is imperative he has to come he must come even according to the prophecy the the lord jesus christ is going to come back again but he is not going to come again before a ministry that is going to prepare the people's hearts for his coming comes and this ministry is that which was promised it has already come we have received that elijah we have received that ministry and our hearts are being prepared already and uh any time we believe that the lord jesus christ is coming to rupture he's waiting bride away praise the name of the lord amen now i i i think i'll be ready for to take questions i see several of you uh here on youtube uh is a few i've also been on on on youtube those of you here on zoom uh i think i'll take one by one as as it comes before we we get disconnected maybe i'll begin from you here or whoever is if those of you who are not on zoom and you love to switch on your video i think i would so much appreciate that okay so if you want to unmute yourself you can go ahead and undo that okay do we have anyone with a question yes okay i'm waiting with someone with a question i know that many people

be doing that from tomorrow the lord willing we'll be doing several shoots so that we can be able to send it out we've had quite a lot of responses from the previous videos that we we did and met a
