Lord, we humble ourselves, Lord Jesus, before you for your word tells us that wherever two or three gathers in your name, you will come, Lord, and be in our midst. And Lord, that is our confidence this morning. Lord, that the creator of heavens and earth is in our midst. Father, we are mortal being. We are insufficient, Lord. [Music] But Lord your word is divine. We are depending upon your word today. I'm glad to know that there is a land beyond the land. [Music] That's why we are here Lord Jes. That's why we are moving on every day. That's why we are not giving up Lord Jesus because there is a land before us. Father this morning Jesus we pray that you forgive us from our sins where we have strayed during the course of the world where we have let you down where we have committed sins of commission and omission. Forgive us this morning. Release the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and cleanse each and every soul Lord. May the blood of Jesus stand between us and our sins. That when you look in our midst this morning, he will see us through the blood. Lord, may the great Holy Spirit move. May you take the full preeminence. Come and glorify your word, Lord. Take me out of the way and come and speak to your bride. Father, cleanse my lips, Lord Jesus. You sanctify the congregation. You told Moses to gather the people.

We rebuke you in the name of Jes Lord Jesus. May you touch them from the crown of their head, the soul of their feet. In the most precious name of the Lord, we commit the word at your hands. Bless your reading of the word. And may the Holy Spirit come and give us inspiration in Christ Jesus name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless you this morning. &gt;&gt; Yeah, brother.

[Music] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I trust everyone is okay. I want us to go straight to the reading of the word. You pray for me this morning that the Lord will use me to speak to you. I know it is quite some time I taken some more time but the Lord knew that I would stand here this morning. Amen. Our pastor is not with us. Uh we know where he is. Shall we turn to Deuteronomy chapter one? We're reading from uh vers 18. And I commanded you at the time all things which you should do. And when we depart from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of Amorite, as the Lord our God commanded us. And we come uh and and we came to Kadeshban. And I said unto you, you uh unto you, come, you are come unto the mountain of Amorite, which the Lord our God doth give unto us. Behold the uh behold the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee. Go up and possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee, Fear not, neither be discouraged. And you and ye came near unto unto me, everyone of you, and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us. There shall search us out of uh out of the land and bring us word again. By which by what way we must go up and into what city we shall come. for [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! [Music] [Music] Amen. Precious Lord, we thank you for the reading of the word. We ask you that you add your blessings upon it in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may take your seats. Yeah, this morning I have something that I want us to share. &gt;&gt; And I will call my title this morning. There is a land. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Tell your neighbor there is a land. Praise the Lord. And where we have read in Deuteronomy, we are seeing uh we know the journey of Israelites from the bondage from the land of bondage [Music] to the promised land. Praise the Lord. The prophet tells us that when they were in Egypt, they were the people of God. Amen. But when God sent them the liberator, to bring them out of that land. And when there went to the promised land, they became the church of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And this morning, I have something that I want us to share. Uh and we are calling it there is a land. Praise be to God. How many believe there is a land? We are spiritual Israelites, physical Israelites. They had the land which God had promised to them. God promised their father Abraham that he would give them that land and time came for them to leave Egypt and go to that land. Blessed be the name of the Lord. We are in another exodus and this is called the third exodus. Praise be to God. Every time there's an exodus, there is something God is fixing to say every time when God moves it means something. Whenever God moves, there's something fixing to happen. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. And this morning, I want us to move as God is moving. Praise be to God. And here where we have read in Deuteronomy, we are seeing God telling them of the land. But I want us also to read in Joshua chapter one where God spoke to Joshua and told him. Joshua chapter one say that now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord. It came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Non Moses my minister saying Moses my servant is dead now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou an older people and to the land which I do give to them. Amen. even the children of Israel. Every step that the soul of your foot shall troll upon that have I given unto you. And as I said unto Moses, from the wilderness and this Lebanon, even to the great river Ephes, all the land of the Hittite, and unto the great sea, toward the going down of the sun shall be your cause. There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God was telling them of a land where they had never been there before. Praise be to God. And God was instructing them. God sent them a prophet to lead them to that land because they did not know the land. God knew that land. Amen. But still them being human, when they reached Jordan, God commanded Joshua to choose amongst them every tribe, one person, one man to go and spy them. Blessed be the name of God. Praise be to God. God knows that we are human being. There are some things which are very hard for us to believe. So we'll always make a way. That's why in every generation God sends a prophet because the word of God comes to the prophet. Amen. And the prophet sees deep in the mind of God and comes and tells us that indeed there is a land. Praise be to God. Amen. That's why God chose told Joshua to choose one man amongst every tribe. Those were 12 men. Go and spy the land. And as if that was not enough, when they went by the land, they came with evidence. &gt;&gt; Still for the lady, still for the congregation, not only to hear the what the spies say, but to see the evidence that the land is real. It flows milk and honey. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. This man came with a uh with a report. They came with a fruit. Amen. That was enough evidence, their words meant nothing. Their evidence, it was the most important thing. Not what they are saying. Okay. You are saying the land is there. They are anx evidence. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That was the proof. Amen. And remember this was physical Israel. But even the spiritual Israel, we have a land to possess. And I'm here to tell you that there is a land. &gt;&gt; The land is real. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Says in the message what shall we do with G uh sorry in the proving his word. He says that see they see they will have the evidence that God said it is good land. and it and it is filled with milk and honey. It's a it's a it's a grand land. It's a good land. Now you all all the old uh old garlic leak and whatever you got here in Egypt. [Music] Now we are taking you to a land with milk and honey. You probably never tasted either one milk or honey down there in Egypt. And all these years, praise be to God. They just give you the slaves uh riot rioting but now you are going to this land just at the time they got in about one day's journey. Blessed be the name of the praise the Lord. You know when God say there is a land, God means it. He meant it. Amen. When God told us that there is rapture, brother, rapture is coming. Amen. We know that rapture is in the message of our day when we still out there. We thought that will just happen after. But we are glad that through the uh by the eyes of the prophet, amen, he breaks us these things down. We know that it moves in stages. Blessed be the name of the Lord and you are very sure that you already in that process. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. So we have a land to possess. And Jesus himself said, "I'm going to prepare a place and where I am, there you will also be. I will come. I praise the Lord." Jesus our Joshua, the Holy Ghost. He went to spy the Lord. And he died on the cross. Praise be to God. He went to hell and conquered hell. And from there he went to heaven and he came down in the form of the Holy Ghost with a proof with an evidence that this land I'm talking about is real. Blessed be the name. Amen. Amen. That makes us to know where we are, where we are standing, what we believe, and where we are going. Amen. Because in our DNA, in God's DNA, in his DNA, we were the foundation of God. And that blood line flowing through us. Praise be to God. Amen. And God knew very well Joshua and they are not going to be undisputed. Praise the Lord. Amen. I'm glad to know and I believe that I'm in God's DNA. And that's why many things have come our way. We have been beaten down and up. We have been tried and shaken. Amen. But we have not given up. We are still moving on. And we are not here to give up. Every time we come to church, we are coming to tell the devil, we are not giving up. It is not yet over. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Amen. When you are down in the spirit and then you come to church sometime even myself, there's a point where you just have to force yourself down. Amen. The devil will give you 100 reasons of not coming to church. You see you are tired. You see you are weak. You even have headache. What if you collapse on the way? You don't even have transport. Maybe sometime now you're going to sacrifice that. Will you eat the word? You are even hungry. And indeed when you are hungry and you will not play that tongue like 100 times and you be joining like after now. [Music] Praise be to God. But every time I remember that there is a land beyond the river. That is what matters. Amen. Amen. I have the evidence because I received the Holy Ghost. That is the harness of my salvation. Praise be to God. And that is what keeps us moving. Blessed be the name of the Lord. God knew that they would not believe their report. So he told he told Joshua take the evidence. Yes sir. When they see those evidence somehow they will believe. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Sometime even when you don't want to believe there is something in your heart to tell you this is the word of God. Amen. You are familiar with it. Amen. Because that is the language which we spoke before the foundation. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. Joshua knew that the land was there. He went first and found out that that uh he found out that he could come back as a witness. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was a witness. He had an evidence and he was skunk sure that they are taking the land even in this gen. What is going to keep us moving? It is to know that we are on the right track and we are fighting the right battle and we are in the right place that there is a that heaven is real and hell is real. Not until you reach that point where you know that heaven is real and hell is real. You have not started. Blessed be the name of Amen. We must have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The land where we are going is a land is a different land. It's a spanial land. It's a spiritual land. &gt;&gt; Amen. And you can only go there. by faith in God's word. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And because God knew that, that's why he has given us the portion of his spirit. That will always remind us the reason was as to why we are here on earth. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Joshua went there and came back with a report even today in the message of the hour, we have the 12. We have the 10 spies. They are there to discourage you. They are there to contend with the word, contend with a message. Blessed be the name of the Lord. They're the one who will tell you thunder is not revealed. They're the one who will tell you this and that. Blessed be the name of God. Whose report are you taking? Praise be to God. Those are the men who have not even been there. Yes. Praise be to God. In fact, for them, &gt;&gt; they just believed the report, [Music] but they never went there. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But we have a prophet who went there and came as a witness. He came with a report. He was the true witness. Praise be to God. Whose report are you believing? Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Is it for this man? Or you believing the prophet's report. Praise the Lord. He came and preached the message. the ficial home of the heavenly bride and the earth of the earthly bride and heaven bride. Blessed be the name of the lord Jesus. So even today we are going to have those uh people who will reason with the word. They are putting their theology in the word. They are explaining this and that. They want to prove how vindicated they are. For us, we know and we believe that the message is already vindicated. Praise be to God. And every time even when they are ministering, they want always people to take pictures. Then after You find them watching. Do you see that thing? Praise be to God. They want to prove that they are vindicated. The message is vindicated. We don't want any man's vindication. Praise be to God. Give us the message. That is all we need. It is the message telling us that there is a land. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Our prophet went there. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And he came back and told us that there is a land. And Jesus gave a promise. I will send you the Holy Ghost. Not another comforter, but the very one who is with you. When he will come. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will never leave you comfortless, but I will send your comforter. The Holy Ghost when he comes. Amen. It is the Holy Ghost telling us about where we are. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You know the blood of Jesus when it's only the blood of Jesus that separates the bride of Christ and the ordinary church member. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. You'll find two people struggling. One is contending with the word. Another one is just believing. Praise be to God. But there are others you find them fasting. It can't be. It did not meant this before the creation. There were some being there. Praise be to God. There are men in this world. Every time they hold the Bible like this, You find them looking for mistakes. Give them the message. They claim to be message believers. There are those even who are in the message. Every time they hold a message book, they're looking for the prophet. They're looking for mistake. Those are the 10 spies. They are the 10 spies. Praise be to God. But those who are in God before the foundation of the world. Amen. You see, God allowed even science to break in his lap. Yeah, they can take a samp of your blood and they test your DNA. In fact, they can tracement up to your third grandfather. Praise be to God. And you and there is sometimes there's what they call the bad blood. Yes. the blood of those people. The third grandfather there was a very good night dancer. They can get the samp of your blood and they take it to the lab and they check and they can even discover some of the heart that your grandparents all the diseases your God allows that. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; That is not just science. So when the Bible tells you that we were in God before the foundation of the world, why do you doubt that? Amen. Get a lab of faith. Amen. Take your blood by the word. Look at your character. Look at your likes. Look at things that attract to you. Amen. Then get the word. Compare and contrast. You will know that I was in God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise be to God. I'm here to tell you this morning that in your blood vein flows the royal blood. The same blood that flows from the vein of Emmanuel where sin has belonged. Amen. Praise be to God. That is the blood of God. And that is what tells you even when you are discouraged brother there is a land. There is a land. This time is not physical land. This time is not physical. Praise be to God. But inside your blood, deep in your heart, there is something telling you. So we look like them. We behave like we do. We work with them. But deep inside there is something that they cannot have. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's what Abraham had. Old man of 80 years, 90 years, he's in the supermarket buying diaper, buying baby soul. So, father, grandpa Abraham, and do you have a son? You are buying for. &gt;&gt; Yes, I'm buying for my son. Oh, but we know you don't have a child. It's now 90 years. It's 100 years. Yes. The Lord promised me and he gave me a child. Even his name is be called Isaac. Praise be to God. Maybe if Abraham was in this day, he would go to those who are doing embroidery. If you go to brother Emma, those who are doing graphic, I tell him, put the name Isaac on this plant. God is going to give my child. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. God's word cannot fail. When God promises, I don't care how long it will take. Praise be to God. Don't think that Joshua was not discouraged. Joshua was human being like you and I. Only the difference was that in Joshua he had something special. Amen. This man was there. People were dying because of unbelief. Maybe was there in the night they knock at his door. Neighbor is gone. Oh God, maybe immediate neighbor, my relative is gone. He might have been discouraged. Praise be to God because he's a man like you and me. Praise the Lord. He was not a superman. But he was a believer of the word. Praise the Lord. He knew that God who studied that good work. There's no way he can stop. Amen. There's no way Joshua went to the promised land. Came back with positive report. Still the congregation telling them We are more than able. He never looked at his age. He looked at the promise. He never looked at his neighbor. He looked at the promise. Praise be to God. Amen. This message all about me. It's not even about my wife or my neighbor or my children. high and high alone. That's how we supposed to take the word. That's how we supposed to take the word. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Remember when it was revealed to Job. Job knew where what he was talking about. Even his wife tried discouraged. But inside job there is something There was something speaking to him. Amen. Job knew that God cannot just leave him. That's why David say, "I was young and now I'm old. I've never seen righteous person." Not his children or seed begging. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Our God is a rich God. He has everything we need. Amen. He's more than able to take us to the rapture. He would have not mentioned it. But because he know that he's more than able. Yes sir. And because when he saw us there praise be to God. Sometime I just think God there in glory. Maybe every evening because he used to visit Adam in the in the cool of the evening. He walks through the corridors of heaven. He comes to that to that great dining hall. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Angels are prepared. Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Decoration is going on over there. Chairs are being worked on ground. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Precious stones of silver and gold rubies is being laid all over. Praise be to God. And maybe every evening God comes around like this &gt;&gt; turn like this. &gt;&gt; The one who will miss heaven. You rather miss going for Independence Day &gt;&gt; than missing heaven. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. We are not just comforting ourselves. We mean it. That's why we have forsaken everything. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. preparing every single day. That's why he has given us the blood that cannot expire until rapture. It will never expire. As long as the ransom church is here, Amen. Amen. It will never fall. I don't care how many time you fall. As long as you fall and rise, the blood is there. Every time the blood is boiling, go deep yourself in the blood because there is a land somewhere where we are going. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; On the day of Pentecost, he told them, you know, many time when you are preaching, maybe even outside or in here, then they ask you, but we want an evidence. Praise be to God. But on the day of Pentecost, when they were charged, 100% charge. Praise be to God. Then Peter preached without a microphone. But God amplified his voice, "Hallelujah." Amen. &gt;&gt; And the congregation scream, "What shall we do &gt;&gt; to have that?" &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. Peter told them, "You want evidence in the message question and answer. If you want evidence of it, repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift, the Holy Ghost." That is the evidence that raised us up. He said I will give you the earnest of your inheritance. And what happened on the day of Pentecost? &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit came upon believer. God saw things. God saw things we were going to face. Oh, God. Oh, amen. God saw things we're going to face in the world. And he say let me give the earest of my spirit. There is nothing we face in this earth which you cannot overcome. Hallelujah. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. In fact, God is children. They can never be defeated. Every time you lose, you lose &gt;&gt; because you have accepted your opponent to win you. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. If you look at boxing matches like those who are popular sometime there is a tendency where they meet in the back at the back door. And then they say, "I'm going to give you this much." Yeah. You allow me to. I have to keep my standard. Let me give you some money so that now you fight. You You allow him &gt;&gt; to beat you. the the the punch that will put you down. Amen. &gt;&gt; When they beat you that that you can &gt;&gt; when they give you KO knock out you knock out. They knock you and you get out of your cell. But to the children of God, brother, sister, Jesus took your KO. That's why he came on the cross. Praise be to God. Before Jesus came, the prophet were not the devil's march. When Jesus came on the cross, the prophets, they could not manage to overcome the devil and overcome that spirit of death. That is why all of them died. Praise be to God. Amen. But the amazing thing, even though they died, they remained when Elisha died and they brought back a dead man. &gt;&gt; When when there was a dead man who fell onto the bones, &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; of the dead prophet. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That dead man came back to life. &gt;&gt; When a believer died, fully charged. &gt;&gt; You die with power. What you need to do, the only thing you need to do is for God to give you the the the &gt;&gt; earnest of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. So before Jesus came, the devil knew the point of doing it. And that's why all of them feared death after Elijah consuming the 400 prophets. And he had that Jezebel had sworn by that today you are head to my prophet is what is coming to you. The Bible says the man took off. He ran for his life. We forgot that. They even forgot where the fire came from. The fire never came from Elijah. The fire came from heaven. [Music] Amen. He was supposed to stand and call that same God and consume that this wicked woman. But the man of God forgot and he thought came from him. So he took off running for his life. Amen. Then one day it was declared in heaven. The champion of the champion was born, the king of kings and the lord of lords. His name is Jesus. Praise be to God. Amen. He started going through a training when he was 12. He invaded the temple. That was part of his training. He started preaching, telling them about where he came from, telling them about the land. Yeah, there is a land where he came from. And I'm telling that land, you don't even grow old. That's why he told them before Abraham I was he was speaking the heaven language which they could not understand. They only understood theology language where they say Moses never crossed the Red Sea. But the children of Israel they cross by the sea. That is theology. Here comes man from heaven, the pillar of fire in flesh. Now, the one who led them, he was speaking of what he did. Yes sir. Jesus was speaking of himself. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. That is the difference. between the bride of Christ and the nominal church believer. Praise be to God. When they speaking of the message, they know what they are speaking about. They know why the message came and they know where the message got them. Praise be to God. They don't fuss around with it because they know the land is real. Amen. Through this message, we have received the Holy Ghost and then you are coming with your own kind of stuff. And you're telling us the message is not true. Some need psychiatrist. Spiritual psych. Praise be to God. You have used the boat and you cross the river and after you have reached the banks of the river, you are criticizing the boat. You have a problem. Praise be to God. But not to those people who know that there was a land because they had an evidence. Blessed be the name of him. They know that the blood cell of God is in their life. And that's what brings separation. It's only the blood of Christ. When we find that you have not separated, you are still reasoning with the word because your bloodline has problem. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; You need to go to the doctor, Dr. Jesus and check your lineage, you realize through the the prophet's preaching, do you know that in most of all if if not all his sermons also far the one I have read, you will find brother He always bring these two groups of people in every message he preach. &gt;&gt; He could not forget the serpent. Praise be to God because that's how it was from Genesis to Revelation. In heaven there was Mike and Lucifer. In Eden there was Cain. There was Esau and Jacob. There was Jesus and Judah. Praise be to God. So those two they walking together. So when you find yourself things are not go back and trace your blood. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But we thank God. And we know where we are going by the grace of God. The world we are living in is not fit for us. There is a land where we are going. Amen. And we are conure and we are pulled by that land. Praise be to God. Many time we are so cautious about our bosses. Why have you not come? My boss has refused me. But those the same bosses of yours. You'll be surprised one of these days. They will tell you tomorrow. They will tell you that your boss passed on the night and where will you go? He knew me better. Promotion promised a promotion. But now he's gone. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm done. &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; our promotion comes from God. Let us trust God. Amen. Let us wait on him. Let us do his will. Praise be to God. Even when our earthly bosses are gone, they will still keep us. Praise be to God. Amen. I was telling you something that a Christian &gt;&gt; we are overcome because we allow to be overcome. Jesus took all our punches. He rubbed all our delicate part. Praise be to God. Human beings had delicate part and fighters always look for that part. Praise be to God. Medical doctors knows there's where someone can squeeze you and and you faint. Jesus knew very well. Amen. and all those parts he covered by going to the cross dying and rising. And today the devil bribes you and you take easy bribery fornication [Music] of lies. Amen. Of bitterness of hatred. The moment you receive that you are gone. You have bleached through your you have bleached into your uh your h. Blessed be the name of the lord. It's not god who is failed. That is you are failing. It's you who have failed your soul. Blessed be the name of the lord. Amen. But when we know that there is something we are fighting, you will hardly give up. You will fight to the last moment. Amen. You'll trust God regardless of what happened. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because we know we'll be having a reason to live. Daniel by the word. He was reading the prophets scroll. Their time for going back was near. The Bible says he passed in his heart. Why? Because there was a land was going back. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And here God himself speaking to Joshua and telling him, I will never leave you. No man will be able to stand before you. God can't start something and stop it in the middle. &gt;&gt; You never believe the message stop on the way. How many remain in the Catholics? How many remain in the denomination came out because God pulled you out? Many times alongside the way when we reach in the way we are distracted. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; These men who are perverting the children of God who are doing it now is because of their own selfishness ambitions. Praise be to God. They know the word is true. They know the message is the Bible is the absolute. They know the message not contradict with the Bible. But because somebody may promise them something because they want to make a big namely. They drift from the word and they force the native to believe in their gain saying blessed be the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Brother says God is looking for a man and women who are going to stand like Daniel. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Are you here? Are you ready to stand like Daniel? Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's what God is looking for. Praise the Lord. There's a land where we are going [Music] and Jesus is there. The lamp is the light there. That's why we give you the word. We don't give you our own word. The word of him who is there who has a witness. Praise be to God who was on earth same time in heaven. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that's why we are giving the word every day. We are telling that brethren there is a land and the land is real. Praise be to God. Righteousness reign. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. But when &gt;&gt; we're going to all right. Yeah. He said here that there there is a witness called Joshua which means Jehovah's Savior crossed over Jordan into the land and we turned back into the turn back with the evidence that the land was just exactly what the prophet said it was with the word of God. They had a bunch of grapes taken two men pack and they called and they could taste the original fruit from the land. Nobody know the land. They just believed it. They walked out by faith. Now when they inherited the when they inhed their land, how happy they was. Each one could live in peace, have his little garden, have his children and everything. But yet the old old age finally got him and death cornered him. and took him. Then down from the corners of heaven through a woman came another great warrior, the greatest of all them called himself made flesh in the flesh Jesus Christ. And he told Israel what a great people they had been. But death faced them. He say, "But I'm telling you of another land. In my father's house are many. If it wasn't so, I would have not told you. You are happy in your land. You have your homes. You have your children. But you are buying each one of each one out yonder." and and it seems it it seems to be the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. Here I say that now remember none of them had never been there and they never know there was even a land. just by faith went went by what was told to them. Amen. Amen. God had a place for them and there was going to that place just by faith. Now think of that, left Egypt and God brought them out and now they are nearing the land. And when they got near the land, Joshua goes over into the land, brings back the evidence, crosses Jordan, goes over into Palestine, bring back the evidence, great bunch of grapes, that taken two men to pack. Amen. And they could eat those grapes and say, "The land is just Notice then the preparation for his promised land. Notice what he's saying. First he had the people that he had made a land for them. He had prepared a land for them. And now he send them down there a preparation for it. For the promised land people, it was only for those who were predestinated to that promised land. He said bride day and how and how he done it. He sent a prophet with a message identified by the pillar of fire. ever talking that they could rest assure that it was right. That is right. It was her consolation. This is what God has done in our day. He has sent a prophet with a message vindicated the pillar of fire. Amen. To prepare the bride. Prepare for what? For a land. Brother, there is a land. We're not here just to become another human being. Just bunch of nice people, smart people. We are here for a cause. We are going somewhere. Amen. Amen.

We are preparing for something. You are preparing for a land. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your crying is not in vain. But sometimes because your theophan is close to you and you look back and see what God has done, others help you fighting your battles. You would be out there in B. But you are here with a clear conscience. You know the kind of person you are. You know that you are part of God. You are spial being flesh. Praise be to God. There is a land brother where we are going. Hallelujah. We have a proof of his salvation. If the reason why you're objecting the world, it is because you have not received the earnest of your spirit. Tells us that without the Holy Spirit, you've not even become the worshipper. You not even started worshiping God. Just in the process, If you are making chapati, you are still in the in the process of making the wheat. &gt;&gt; You are not yet a chapati. But the master is interested in chapati.

And the prophet says the Holy Ghost. And here says that there was another kadesh called Calvary. Hallelujah. The judgment seat of God. Blessed be the name of the Lord. He saying I came to Calvary the judgment seat again where the penalty of sin that cause men to die. It was met at judgment. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That was another judgment seat. And Jesus went there. &gt;&gt; He crossed over. &gt;&gt; He went to the promised land. He came with the evidence and tells us in my father's house, "Oh brother, are many mansions [Music] and that's where we are going. There is a land. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There is a land. There is a land, brother. There's a land. Sister Jesus went to prepare a place said and then on the day of Pentecost he sits by he sends back the earnest of this place the assurance the evidence that the land is real like Joshua brought back the evidence Jesus brought back the evidence of the Holy Ghost. Now record our we record ourselves dead. We are buried with him in baptism after his death and we rise with him in the resurrection and now we are in. We are in not we are going. We are already raised. &gt;&gt; Oh my We are now not we will be &gt;&gt; we are now tonight sitting &gt;&gt; in heaven places. How in Christ Jesus not we will not we will be some other time we are now the church don't realize who you are. [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; When Jesus came, &gt;&gt; see we don't get to only to die of old age again. There are those who will be raptured. I just pray that rapture comes in my time. Blessed be the name of we have a reason why we are still pushing on. You must have a reason. All of us have challenges but let us read the right notes. &gt;&gt; Message believer is reading book. Yes. Believer, &gt;&gt; you listen to worldly music. [Music] Praise the Lord. But I'm here to tell you, never forget that there is a land where we are born. And that land Abraham purchas it with his money. That was the land of resurrection where he buried his people. Even Joseph said, "Take me back in that land, the promised land. Blessed be the name of God. But I'm telling you of another land which was purchased by Jesus Christ. He purchased by his own blood. Hallelujah. And that's why today you are supposed to be buried in Christ. [Music] Be buried in Christ. Whosoever believes and baptized they shall be saved. &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ is the land of resurrection. Be buried. Die of your own soul. Rose to your soul. Be buried in Christ. Not there, brother. Rise in the Holy Ghost. Rise the newness of life. And you will see that land. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That land where they went, the prophet tells us, it has a good fruit. I thought it was a fatile land, flowing milk and honey. But there is another land, brother, sister. The land is Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. It is flowing with gifts, those with healings, eternal life, wisdom, &gt;&gt; victory, &gt;&gt; blessed be the name of Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I am summarizing. I want to finish say that that but he crossed also the Jordan. In the message confirmation and the evidence and said the judgment seat was kadesh bane to kadesh bane calvary upon him bore all the sins of the world at Calvary. Amen. And it say that he went over into the land into other land and was dead for three days and night. He died till the sun quit shining. And he died till the earth had nervous breakdown. He shook the rocks out of the mountain. He died and on the third day he rose back again with the evidence that there is a land where a man can live and not die. He returned back from the land. There is life after death. And you hear people say, "How can you prove that when you die there is another life?" Which proof do you have? &gt;&gt; The proof you have Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why even the young rich ruler when he wanted to go back requested to go preach to his house to believe Abraham told him you have the prophets the prophets were preaching Jesus Ask Jesus is the only proof that there is life after tear. You don't need any other proof. Muhammad says even where I'm going, I don't know. But ask the son of ask is praise be to God. They were not sure the Muhammad the Buddhas. Praise be to God. All of them. All of them died not knowing their destination. But there's a man who knew the land where he came from. He spoke with authority because he had an evidence. He told the Pharisees Hey, break this temple and I assure you in just 3 days within 3 days the temple is going to be up again. He knew what he was potential of doing. Brother, sister, there is something that your potential of doing. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a connection from that land. That's why when you face the devil, he will start to tremble. Why? He's seeing a stranger from the fra land. Why will the devil tremble? He was kicked out of that land. And when he sees ambassadors of that land, he knows they are kicking me up again. That's where we came from. &gt;&gt; The land, the glory land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why the Bible say we shall lay our hands on the sick and they shall recover. Amen. Amen. When we have patience, when we have patient, patient, when we approach patient, &gt;&gt; praise be to God because we didn't we are not from this land and the sicknesses of this land, we are infected sometime by them sickness. Blessed be the name of the Lord. But when we come Amen. After we have known who we are, where we came from, when we meet this fellow, hallelujah, because it's part of us, this strange sickness, these demons will tremble. Hallelujah. Brother said sometime when he was praying for the sick, other demons could call for enforcement. Praise be to God. When you confront the sick person and the sick person believes in the world, hallelujah, the devil will have to go because you have two things in common. There is a connection between you and his patient. Praise be to God. So believers, we know what we are talking about. We know that the message is true that God is real. We are sure that this word cast the devil. Hallelujah. That's what we need to sink in our heart. [Music] Blessed be the name of God. The only way God has shallowed to send his word to us and through preaching is you to believe and the word will work for you. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. So when the Bible say that we are Christ ambassador, brother we ambassadors of heaven, &gt;&gt; we are representing another country. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus was so sure. Do you know why even when like it sound like he was even bragging break this temple in three days my father will raise it up. didn't say no sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is the chief engineer. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. He said break this temple in just three days. Indeed they broke it to prove. Let him prove. And when they came on the cross breaking the legs of this when they reach on this one you don't need to break his leg. This is the one who say we break yesterday even these thieves are stronger than him. &gt;&gt; It was it was a tactic. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Because the Bible say none of his born was supposed to. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus still warn blessed be the name of the Lord. So for them they thought it was that temple they are looking at. But on the third day, there and there, by the way, when he died, when he gave up the ghost, there was an earthquake. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jesus, what was he doing? Hallelujah. He was raising the foundation of that temple. Amen. He was shaking them. On the third day, he proved to them [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; 40 days after Jesus resurrected, he walked with them &gt;&gt; on the streets. What were they doing? &gt;&gt; They were a witness. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the promised land. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Like Joshua cross and came with evidence when Jesus rose who was our Joshua. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He came with a proof. &gt;&gt; 40 days they saw Abraham. Amen. They saw the shame. They knew that was bitter. Hallelujah. 40 days. &gt;&gt; Then after Jesus went away, &gt;&gt; praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Now we know what we're talking about. Spiritual land is real. One time brother Shem was teaching us. He was showing us the dimensions. It's just here. Death is just switching of dimension. Blessed be the name of the Lord. That's why the prophet tells us, "Oh, brother Bos when he was going he saw him greeting brother so and so him greeting so it's like us here the brother's been down and is going through the Lord and you see him greeting brother God bless you then greets my mother you know God bless you God bless is switching is phasing from this dimension to another one. Praise be to God. That's why the prophet tells us Christians should not fear death. Hallelujah. Amen. You start seeing the things you have been working on. Hallelujah. You start hearing that angel song because there is a land you have been longing for. Praise be to God. And every now and then it's getting too close. Never allow anything stand between you and your God. I believe that's how Enoch was. After he had lived his life, he had done whatever he was supposed to do. I believe he must have even set his family in order. He started walking with God. He started walking with God. And one day the man switched the dimension and he was not there's grave is not on earth. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Went to that land. &gt;&gt; Enoch is not even in the land of Palestine. &gt;&gt; He's in glory. Some here will tell you there is a land brother. Let us press on. Let us not give up. Amen. know that the blood of Christ is running through your veins. &gt;&gt; Brother, you are going to make it. I don't care what the devil is. We are making it. That one is signed. That one is forever settled in heaven. Whether the devil want it, whether the government want it, whether hell want it or not, hell, we are going to make it to glory. Amen. We are fighting every day. We are fighting day by day. We are overcoming day by day. Yes sir. And we are not ready to give up because there is a land. Jesus convinced. Jesus proved &gt;&gt; and even he went ahead and told us if it wasn't so sincerely I would have not told what else do you need more than that if the Hollywood they're trying to play heaven where do they get inspiration from they don't even read the Bible, but the devil gives them inspiration and then they do something familiar and make people think that it's just a drama. Yes, that's what the devil does. A woman wakes up in the morning. He walks uh puts on a short, moves in the street and people give birth tomorrow, one week they start speaking some funny funny words. &gt;&gt; The woman looks good already. They are forgotten. So the devil makes them get used to sin until they think it is normal to sin until until this homosexuals they fight for their right. You see &gt;&gt; but Christian &gt;&gt; let us not get used to take God's thing just ordinary. Never give up until you are sure that you are connected to that. [Music] know in your heart whether you are offended whether you are rejected but in your heart per in your heart that I have somewhere where I'm going even students at school a teacher can become a problem you always tell you to come and go and bring me water, do this, do that. The teacher can be on you, but that that one cannot mean that you are wrong student. Even if you didn't go to school and they do something wrong, they say you were not even present and that one does not take you off track. We have a target. There is somewhere where we are going. That is the main main goal. It's not what brother Martin say. What is God saying? What's God saying about you? It's not how and so discouraging. But what's God speaking about? He says, "I know the things I have. What is God speaking about your life? But sometime you forget. &gt;&gt; We are men pleasers. Let us be God pleasers. Yes. If God is happy, just know you are winning because the joy of the Lord is your strength. Go. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Joshua never even wanted to please the congregation. &gt;&gt; He knew what he was talking about. Yes, sir. Let us stand on our feet. Amen. May God help us &gt;&gt; this journey to Calvary. You go alone. Everything is already finished. What you have to do? You just have to look at Christ. is the only example. That's why we're saying that uh to be like Jesus, the only thing you ought to long on earth is to walk like Jesus, talk like Jesus. Hallelujah. Believe like Jesus. Jesus was not that kind who just gives up. Remember one time pastor was preaching and told us that Jesus never overcame as God but he was man. [Music] Every time Christian we give up so easily. But if we know that there is a land [Music] when I just look at myself more than 20 years down the road, the things I've forsaken [Music] they are quite a lot and the things which I'm still fighting with, which I'm still forsaking every Now they also still there. But when I look back and where I am today, I know the journey ahead of me is less. [Music] We have got many discouragement along the way. We have been disappointed by even our own loved ones. But that not gave us reason to give up because we came to follow Christ. We decided we said no turning back and we are not ready to turn back. [Music] Shalom. You give us the song they are nailed to the cross. [Music] will give us the lyrics to join our forces and we sing that song. [Music] &gt;&gt; Precious father, in the name of Jesus Christ, Lord, we thank you for the word you have sent. It's our desire always to stay connected. We need you to help us. We send a prophet with a message of restoration. Restore us back to the original land. Position that blessing our position in Christ in heaven. [Music] Lord Jesus, help me know how weak I am. But we are leaning on you. &gt;&gt; We are just clinging to the cross [Music] for what you did for us.

Lord Lord we know the sound through the fire through the water through the blood but all through the blood that is sufficient. We know there is a crimson stream of father Lord. There is a talk and Lord red flag in our hearts. Oh hallelujah Lord Jesus we cannot do without you. &gt;&gt; That when you are in us we are overcome Lord. We surrender our being to this day. We must open our eyes, eyes of our understanding to know that there is a land. There is a place somewhere Lord where green grass blows. Oh Lord Jesus, [Music] where we'll never grow old. where we'll never buy clothes, &gt;&gt; where we'll never build houses. Father, we thank the Martians &gt;&gt; over the hilltop, Lord. Oh Jesus, we thank you. Maybe you have a need this morning. You want the Lord to meet at your just your brother. But I'm leaning on that word. If his word faith, not my word, faith. [Music] If he leaves you to faith, it is God faith. But [Music] we're going to pray a prayer of faith. Maybe you have a need or you are sick in the body. We are going to pray and we are going to believe God for your healing. I believe God will grant you a need. I've been having a need in my life for over a year, a huge debt and I looked east, west, south, north and for sure I could not get out of it. But I just believed God and leave it for him. By the time when I was not expected me and I believe that same God, he can surprise you with he can surprise you by meeting your need. And when that happened, I mean when it happened to me, I remember the sermon that pastor preacher said when the devil thought he had won. [Music] That's when God came in. your hands. We pray together. [Music] What you do? Put your hands on your neighbor. [Music] Pray for his needs and let him or her pray for your needs. And let's pray together. The Bible says a prayer of faith much. Whoever comes to God must believe. It's not your brother who's going to give you a need but God who is going to answer your name and we believe we are praying our prayer of faith and we are waiting for that testimony. &gt;&gt; Precious father in the name of Jesus. Lord I pray for my brother here. We pray for Jesus Christ. Heavenly Father, King of glory, the only thing we know is to come to you in prayer.
