[58:24] received
[58:26] as I speak
[58:28] now she she already her sister already
[58:30] has a land
[58:33] title of that piece of
[58:36] land and she did not pay for
[58:44] it uh I understand it is something
[58:47] connected to the government and all that
[58:49] I do not know the
[58:51] details God granted their
[58:54] desire and so she's also believing that
[58:56] God is also going to Grant her
[59:00] desire there is a sister in one of the
[59:05] services swollen swollen
[59:09] legs you know God healed instantly in
[59:13] the
[59:16] meeting after you ministered uh Pastor
[59:20] Sean after you
[59:24] ministered you left some kind of fire
[59:28] here and
[59:31] uh you know there's a young man that was
[59:36] sick and here is the test I just read it
[59:39] say God bless you Saints I GRE you all
[59:41] in the name of of the most high God I
[59:44] thank God who has Set Me Free from the
[59:47] sto I even failed to take my
[59:50] lunch because the pain was too
[59:53] severe but during this praise and
[59:56] dancing unto the
[59:58] Lord after the word was preached by
[1:00:01] Pastor
[1:00:03] Sean I realized that I wasn't feeling
[1:00:06] the pain
[1:00:11] anymore amen and and he says hallelujah
[1:00:14] praise be the Lord Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ God bless you all it's not just
[1:00:20] this is not like the dancing they do in
[1:00:22] the
[1:00:24] club where demon enter
[1:00:27] them remember that little talked
[1:00:31] about you know just said let me let me
[1:00:34] go and here let me she was passing let
[1:00:35] me hear what I used to do and before she
[1:00:39] realized it she was in the arms of a
[1:00:43] man and demons had entered
[1:00:46] her and she she went out
[1:00:49] quickly went woke up brother
[1:00:51] Bram and you know when they met with
[1:00:54] Brother Bram
[1:00:56] try to fight and brother cast them out
[1:01:00] they came out to attack
[1:01:02] brother and the part that was so funny
[1:01:05] for
[1:01:06] me there was another person there you
[1:01:10] know the demons who went at him so he
[1:01:13] took
[1:01:14] off demons are real and the Holy Spirit
[1:01:18] is
[1:01:19] real so so when we are when we are
[1:01:23] dancing praising worshiping
[1:01:26] it's not just singing and feelings and
[1:01:29] emotions Anyway said anything religion
[1:01:33] without emotion
[1:01:35] is and I'm so glad our religion has
[1:01:41] emotion and the Holy Spirit is not
[1:01:44] emotional but he is
[1:01:47] emotional amen praise the name of the
[1:01:50] Lord amen and there's this prayer
[1:01:53] request that I will share as we prepare

[1:22:04] it's not just an American
[1:22:07] message it's not just an African message
[1:22:10] or european message amen but it's a
[1:22:13] Heavenly message and since it's a
[1:22:16] Heavenly message amen we receive the
[1:22:19] benefits of
[1:22:20] Heaven no one gets more benefits than
[1:22:22] the other
[1:22:24] we are beneficiaries of the message of
[1:22:26] the
[1:22:28] hour now I want to speak to you tonight
[1:22:30] on this
[1:22:31] thought peculiarity of light the
[1:22:34] believer walks in can you repeat it
[1:22:36] brother The Peculiar
[1:22:39] light the believer walks
[1:22:43] in when you read 1 John chapter
[1:22:49] 1 the Bible will say in first John
[1:22:51] chapter
[1:22:52] 1 the Bible says this then is the
[1:22:55] message which we have heard of him and
[1:22:58] declare unto you that God is
[1:23:02] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:23:06] if we say that we have fellowship with
[1:23:09] him and we walk in darkness then we lie
[1:23:13] and do not the
[1:23:14] truth but if we walk in the light as in
[1:23:19] the life we have Fellowship one with the
[1:23:22] other and the blood of Jesus Christ his
[1:23:25] son cleanseth us from all
[1:23:28] sin now when you read in the Amplified
[1:23:31] Bible says but if we really walk in the
[1:23:34] life that is we live each and every day
[1:23:39] in the Conformity with the precepts of
[1:23:41] God as he himself is in the L we have
[1:23:46] true unbroken
[1:23:47] fellowship with one another he with us
[1:23:51] and we with him and the blood of Jesus
[1:23:55] his son cleanses us from all sin by
[1:23:59] erasing the stain of sin and keeping
[1:24:03] cleansed from sin in all its forms and
[1:24:09] manifestations you all are very well
[1:24:11] aware we have just come out of an old
[1:24:14] year and we have come into a new year we
[1:24:18] have come out of
[1:24:19] 2024 and we have come into
[1:24:22] 2025 in 195 6 brother Rand preaches a
[1:24:27] sermon on New Year's Day and he entitles
[1:24:31] it why are people why are people so
[1:24:35] tossed
[1:24:37] about now not that in this the new year
[1:24:41] but it's the new turn of
[1:24:43] time he says I believe we are living in
[1:24:45] a very wonderful glorious
[1:24:48] State it's a wonderful glorious day of
[1:24:52] opportunity when the people of this they
[1:24:55] are living to see the Shadows of the
[1:24:59] coming of the Son of God he said I
[1:25:01] believe with all of my heart that the
[1:25:04] world is going to burst now into the
[1:25:07] greatest Revival that was ever known or
[1:25:11] it's going into the darkest chaos that's
[1:25:14] ever been known in history now you all
[1:25:17] know that
[1:25:18] 1956 was a very significant year in the
[1:25:23] ministry of William
[1:25:25] very significant year in the history of
[1:25:28] the world because it was the year the
[1:25:32] world would accept the gospel or they
[1:25:35] would reject the gospel and the prophet
[1:25:37] of God said it's a wonderful day he said
[1:25:41] now this is your time to make a decision
[1:25:45] on what you're going to do now how many
[1:25:48] knows that the world decided to turn
[1:25:52] down the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:25:55] America rejected a prophet's Ministry
[1:25:58] but what I love about what a prophet is
[1:26:00] saying is that the world's decision has
[1:26:04] nothing to do with the believer's
[1:26:06] decision see the world turned the
[1:26:08] message down the world rejected the
[1:26:11] gospel he said but if there happens to
[1:26:13] be someone here today who hasn't made
[1:26:16] the decision right for Christ he said I
[1:26:19] trust this morning you say yes Lord this
[1:26:23] is the day
[1:26:25] I my decision to serve you the rest of
[1:26:28] my life it's a wonderful day I'm sure
[1:26:32] that our eyes has been just even
[1:26:35] Believers even Believers we can see
[1:26:38] what's going on around us and many times
[1:26:42] spiritual L people are
[1:26:46] misunderstood to the people of the world
[1:26:49] because it's such a strange and in our
[1:26:52] life to live a full surrender life to
[1:26:55] the Lord Jesus if you are a Believer you
[1:26:59] have been called by God out of the
[1:27:02] darkness into this marvelous line as
[1:27:06] Believers we have to accept this fact we
[1:27:10] are going to be peculiar we are going to
[1:27:13] be oddballs we are going to be strange
[1:27:17] all said I am become a fool glor he has
[1:27:22] compelled me for have been commended of
[1:27:25] you for nothing am I behind the very
[1:27:29] Chief
[1:27:30] Apostles the very Chief
[1:27:33] Apostles amen though I be nothing now
[1:27:37] here Paul is saying that I am a fool I
[1:27:41] am a fool to the world because I do not
[1:27:44] use the
[1:27:45] world can I say something to you the
[1:27:49] wisdom of the world is foolishness to
[1:27:52] the believer
[1:27:54] wisdom of God is foolishness to the
[1:27:57] world see then I'll say this tonight I
[1:28:00] am not ashamed to be called an oddball
[1:28:04] an oddball is a fool it is a person that
[1:28:09] really has lost their
[1:28:11] mind so you have to be somebody's fool I
[1:28:15] would rather be a fool for Christ
[1:28:17] because God said that his people were a
[1:28:20] peculiar people they were odd they were
[1:28:24] peculiar they were odd they were chosen
[1:28:28] they are elected they are royal
[1:28:31] priesthood they are offering spiritual
[1:28:33] sacrifices to God that is the fruit of
[1:28:37] their lips giving praise to his name see
[1:28:41] I have not forgot that I am a gentile
[1:28:44] who was called by Grace the lineage of
[1:28:48] Jesus Christ therefore I have got to
[1:28:52] give God praise
[1:28:54] without him I would not be here in
[1:28:58] sermon why our people so tossed about
[1:29:02] prophet of God says he says I want you
[1:29:04] to notice another thing about this it is
[1:29:08] the peculiar light of the believer that
[1:29:13] walks in the peculiar of the
[1:29:16] light the believer walks in when he is
[1:29:20] in Christ the peculiarity of it
[1:29:25] amen I'm
[1:29:32] lost the believer
[1:29:34] Walks In A peculiar
[1:29:37] life I'll say this not only is a
[1:29:40] Believer
[1:29:42] peculiar but the food that a Believer
[1:29:44] eats is
[1:29:46] peculiar and the light that they walk in
[1:29:49] is PE now I'll say this we have come out
[1:29:52] of different walks of
[1:29:55] life every individual sitting here has
[1:29:59] come out of a different Walk of Life
[1:30:02] maybe some of you were raised in church
[1:30:05] maybe some of you were raised in the
[1:30:06] message maybe some of you come out of
[1:30:08] the world some of you come from another
[1:30:11] country we're all gathered here and we
[1:30:15] all come out of different walks of life
[1:30:18] the prophet of God said Lord you have
[1:30:21] taken alcoholics
[1:30:24] prostitutes you have taken drug ad and
[1:30:27] you have brought them out of every Walk
[1:30:31] of Life and made ladies and gentlemen
[1:30:34] out of
[1:30:35] them now you know why you came out it's
[1:30:38] because you're a part of EX and exodus
[1:30:42] means called out called out means the
[1:30:46] church and now God is calling his people
[1:30:50] out of every Walk of Life to come and
[1:30:53] receive
[1:30:55] and to believe on him now let me say
[1:30:58] this there is a difference in a
[1:31:00] Christian
[1:31:01] walk modern Christian walk is difference
[1:31:05] in the Walk of the believer and the walk
[1:31:08] of a modern Christian you know the Walk
[1:31:11] of a modern Christian is Dreadful in the
[1:31:14] eyes of God but we ought to alter
[1:31:18] ourselves to walk with God thisen that
[1:31:21] word peculiar
[1:31:25] odd
[1:31:26] usual an feat you have
[1:31:31] anage characteristic or a quality that
[1:31:35] is
[1:31:36] distinctive of a particular person or
[1:31:40] place it is the quality or the state of
[1:31:44] being peculiar so if you are
[1:31:48] oddc that means you have strange habits
[1:31:52] you have strange features
[1:31:54] see the world has a religious habit they
[1:31:58] go to church they sing a song they hear
[1:32:01] a sermon and they go out the door and
[1:32:04] they live the same way that they did
[1:32:07] before they went but they
[1:32:09] believer into Christ and he receives
[1:32:13] Christ and then he begins to
[1:32:15] walk Christ he has received Christ this
[1:32:20] is more than a youth this is more than a
[1:32:23] f service or a Sunday morning service
[1:32:26] this is a walk amen I'm talking to you
[1:32:30] we're getting ready to leave this Camp
[1:32:33] it's more than it's got to be more than
[1:32:35] just shouting at the altar it's got to
[1:32:37] be more than just dancing in the spirit
[1:32:40] it's got to be more than just screaming
[1:32:42] there has got to come a walk there has
[1:32:45] got to come A Walk to this there is got
[1:32:47] to come a progression there is a feature
[1:32:50] in your life listen the world has habits
[1:32:54] the world has features but the world's
[1:32:56] habits are not the habits of the
[1:32:59] believer the world's features are not
[1:33:01] the features of the believer I have some
[1:33:04] habits can I tell you about my habits I

[1:33:29] I praise God when I'm on the mountain I
[1:33:32] praise God when I'm in the valley I
[1:33:35] praise God because I'm not a modern
[1:33:38] Christian I am a believer who has been
[1:33:41] called out of Darkness Into The

[1:45:04] but we are
[1:45:05] progressing to Perfection we are going
[1:45:09] on to
[1:45:11] Perfection this when brother preach
[1:45:14] why why are people so tossed about he
[1:45:18] said there's two phases of
[1:45:20] Christianity he said there is a he said
[1:45:23] an intellectual
[1:45:25] conception you know what he said he said
[1:45:28] there's an experimental
[1:45:31] experience he said there's an
[1:45:32] intellectual
[1:45:34] conception then there's an experimental
[1:45:37] experience you know what I find I find
[1:45:40] that there is a mind and there is a soul
[1:45:43] and the prophet of God said are very
[1:45:46] much in
[1:45:47] disagreement with each other many
[1:45:50] times the prophet of God so beautifully
[1:45:54] he took time to break this and what he
[1:45:57] did was he brought a view of the Old
[1:45:59] Testament the
[1:46:02] church the children of
[1:46:04] Israel how many knows that there are
[1:46:07] three courts and then there's an outer
[1:46:10] Court there's an inner court and then
[1:46:13] there's a Hol of holies you know in the
[1:46:15] outer Court in the inner court and in
[1:46:19] the holies of holies there was light
[1:46:23] each one was different types but said in
[1:46:26] the outer Court he said the Justified
[1:46:29] man he walks by daylight he said you're
[1:46:32] his child what kind of life for you live
[1:46:36] he said what kind of life is he walking
[1:46:39] in walk according
[1:46:44] to
[1:46:46] outside the gloy and the poy the halfway
[1:46:50] amen a bright day
[1:46:53] day the cloud comes over the side he
[1:46:56] said he's walking but he's walking
[1:46:59] underneath the control of weather light
[1:47:03] so can I say this he wakes up on Sunday
[1:47:06] morning and he opens the shades and he
[1:47:10] sees the sun shining and he sees no
[1:47:13] clouds in the sky and he says praise God
[1:47:16] we're going to have
[1:47:18] chch there's no clouds there's no rain
[1:47:22] there's no there's nothing we're going
[1:47:24] to have church today and he starts to
[1:47:26] church but the next Sunday he wakes up
[1:47:31] it opens the wi and it's cloudy and it's
[1:47:34] rainy and it's foggy and there's no
[1:47:38] sunshine and he says well I'm going to
[1:47:41] go to church and I don't know what I'm
[1:47:43] going to get out of can I tell you what
[1:47:46] that is that is walking by the lck of
[1:47:50] the can move to amen then you can move
[1:47:54] into another Court still not in my ear
[1:47:56] then you can move into another Court in
[1:47:59] the other court there is a different
[1:48:01] kind of life so you move from the
[1:48:04] weather and you move to the Candlestick
[1:48:07] which means there's got to be a priest
[1:48:09] who present to light the candle if
[1:48:12] you're going to have light you got to
[1:48:14] have somebody present to light the
[1:48:17] candle so you move from weather life
[1:48:20] into man control of the life
[1:48:23] so you know what that means that means
[1:48:25] if your favorite preachers in
[1:48:27] town you can have a good service but if
[1:48:31] your favorite preacher is not in town
[1:48:33] then you can't have church because
[1:48:35] you're living by the control of the wi
[1:48:39] of a man there is an outer court that is
[1:48:42] controlled by the weather there is an
[1:48:44] inner court that is controlled by man
[1:48:47] but then there is the holies of
[1:48:50] holies and in the holies of holies
[1:48:53] brother B said it's
[1:48:55] the he said if the neighbor about you it
[1:48:58] don't matter what Happ you will trust in

[1:58:00] outcome outcome now I got to studying
[1:58:04] that word one
[1:58:05] day and I looked up in the
[1:58:07] dictionary and I found a real good
[1:58:10] definition for the word
[1:58:13] outcome but for once in my life I was
[1:58:16] smarter than Webster

[1:58:50] you're coming out of this Kingdom are
[1:58:52] going into the rapture we are going into
[1:58:59] the I'm just going to say it as plain as
[1:59:01] I know how we are walking in truth do
[1:59:05] you know the spoken word is the Original
[1:59:09] Seed you know there were three kinds of
[1:59:13] seeds you know there was a
[1:59:14] denominational seed and it was sown by
[1:59:19] Billy Graham Billy Graham there was a
[1:59:21] Pentecostal seed
[1:59:23] that was swn by or Roberts which led
[1:59:26] into a
[1:59:27] charismatic Prosperity
[1:59:29] movement but then there was a spoken
[1:59:33] word
[1:59:34] seed which was the entire seed of the
[1:59:37] Bible that was to be
[1:59:40] sown The Believer by the message
[1:59:44] of therefore we are not denominational
[1:59:48] seed we are not Pentecostal seed we are
[1:59:52] not charismatic seed we are not a bun of
[1:59:55] prosperity preacher seed we are the seed
[1:59:59] of the
[2:00:00] word spoken word of God has been spoken
[2:00:04] in this age been spoken this generation
[2:00:07] what are you saying I'm saying the seed
[2:00:10] was spoken the word seed was spoken to
[2:00:13] bring the church out ofal
[2:00:17] age
[2:00:19] adoption it's it's a it's a powerful
[2:00:23] shouting is not the
[2:00:25] adoption can I say it to
[2:00:30] youm the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[2:00:34] not the
[2:00:36] adoption I cannot help what men think
[2:00:38] about it what men teach about it there
[2:00:41] was a message of Malachi 4 which was the
[2:00:44] fourth
[2:00:46] light so a Believer walks in life and
[2:00:50] the only a True Believer
[2:00:52] walk they to walk in the propes lot of
[2:00:56] the
[2:00:57] age the of this age was an
[2:01:02] adoption say something to you and the
[2:01:05] adoption is the word some say well just
[2:01:08] get born again and get the Holy Ghost
[2:01:09] that fix
[2:01:11] everything I believe in a new birth but
[2:01:14] I believe in an adoption he said well
[2:01:17] preacher you can't preach that brother
[2:01:20] Brandon preaches a sermon because you
[2:01:22] must be born
[2:01:24] again he reads St John 3 and Ephesians 4
[2:01:29] brother buzi for a long time I wondered
[2:01:34] why did he read John 3 and then
[2:01:37] Ephesians 4 but he gives us a he gives
[2:01:40] us a term he says spiritual
[2:01:44] growth so there's a birth and there's a
[2:01:47] growth into an adoption there is a
[2:01:51] growth
[2:01:52] into an adoption I canot tell you what
[2:01:54] this adoption does this adoption brings
[2:01:57] a
[2:01:58] character oh my this adoption brings a
[2:02:02] character this adoption does not just
[2:02:04] bring a power it brings a character
[2:02:08] because power apart from character is
[2:02:13] satanic come on church that's how come
[2:02:15] the Pentecostals can have the power they
[2:02:19] can prophesy things they can speak
[2:02:21] things in
[2:02:23] and it never comes to pass because it's
[2:02:25] a
[2:02:27] satanic can I preach can I preach am it
[2:02:31] may get Cloud but stay with me can I
[2:02:34] prach brother brandom says if a man says
[2:02:38] something's coming to pass in the name
[2:02:40] of the Lord and it does not happen he
[2:02:43] said that man has Spirit
[2:02:47] on he's got a devil on him and needs to
[2:02:50] be cast out
[2:02:52] do you know how that
[2:02:54] Pentecostal charismatic preachers can
[2:02:57] make false prophecies it's because they
[2:02:59] got the power got no character because
[2:03:03] the only thing that brings character is
[2:03:06] the word and the word is the
[2:03:09] adoption I say we have seen the
[2:03:12] manifestation of a birth and adoption in
[2:03:17] Willam Mary and
[2:03:18] BR we seen a manifestation
[2:03:22] the power of a birth and the power of an
[2:03:25] adoption son God can I tell you what
[2:03:29] brother never he never used the spoken
[2:03:33] word for personal
[2:03:36] game he never used the
[2:03:39] sced the light he was walking in
[2:03:42] personal game you realize he could have
[2:03:45] called oh God it's getting tight can I
[2:03:48] preach brother Sean amen amen can I say
[2:03:50] something to you
[2:03:52] he could have called White House he
[2:03:55] could have called the government of
[2:03:56] America because the power of the gift
[2:04:00] that was in his life and tell them who
[2:04:03] the next president was going to
[2:04:05] be but he never done it you know why
[2:04:09] because he said it would not benefit the
[2:04:11] kingdom of
[2:04:13] God he never used his adoption character
[2:04:17] to a name for
[2:04:19] himself he never used
[2:04:22] his adoption character to build his
[2:04:24] ministry up as a matter of fact in one
[2:04:28] of the most powerful sermons we have on
[2:04:31] the subject of the third pool is a tape
[2:04:35] called humble
[2:04:37] thyself my goodness brother humble
[2:04:42] thyself you really mean the third pull
[2:04:45] if that's the real third pool it's going
[2:04:48] to bring a
[2:04:49] humility can I say this
[2:04:52] we seen the third pull and it was
[2:04:55] manifested in a prophet's Ministry can I

[2:05:26] prophet done he preached the Seven
[2:05:28] Seals trust he stood on a platform and
[2:05:32] said maybe I'm just feeling this way but
[2:05:35] if he will the L come and take the book
[2:05:39] and open the seals he stood on a
[2:05:43] platform as a human being torn in sin by
[2:05:47] sexual desire but he had a birth he had
[2:05:50] a birth the water and the blood and the
[2:05:54] spirit but he didn't stop walking the

[2:06:20] manifestation of the
[2:06:22] adoption character of the word in his
[2:06:26] life he comes to the end of his ministry
[2:06:29] and you know what he says he says these
[2:06:32] words he said Lord it wasn't me that

[2:58:14] move
[2:58:20] God is calling his bride out of
[2:58:23] [Music]
[2:58:25] denominations out of the
[2:58:29] world through the message of the Prophet
[2:58:31] that God has sent us in this last
[2:58:35] days a fulfillment of
[2:58:40] scriptures God promised that he would
[2:58:42] send Elijah in the last
[2:58:45] days and his ministry
[2:58:49] restore us back
[2:58:50] again to the hearts of our
[2:58:56] [Music]
[2:58:57] Pentecostal we have been
[2:59:00] restored away from denominational
[2:59:05] ideas from thoughts of man and words of
[2:59:09] men away from the leadership of
[2:59:13] man back again to the leadership of the
[2:59:15] word
[2:59:18] back again to what Paul preached Peter
[2:59:20] [Music]
[2:59:22] preached back again to the foundations
[2:59:24] of our
[2:59:27] faith this is what this message
[2:59:30] is it is not another
[2:59:33] church this is what this Youth Camp is
[2:59:36] about to raise another
[2:59:40] generation which will stand for this
[2:59:43] message a
[2:59:46] generation which will fear it
[2:59:48] [Music]
[2:59:50] be ready to
[2:59:52] stand this message no matter
[2:59:56] what we have been called in this
[2:59:59] hour and we have been given a
[3:00:04] mandate to tell
[3:00:07] people that they are lost without this
[3:00:12] truth the word is Jesus and Jesus is the
[3:00:15] word
[3:00:18] and what is this message that we
[3:00:21] preach is the revelation of Jesus
[3:00:24] Christ to walk away from it is to walk
[3:00:27] away from
[3:00:29] God this is not just something that is
[3:00:32] lifting up a
[3:00:35] man this is not
[3:00:39] a this is not a
[3:00:41] denomination it is way above
[3:00:46] denomination it is way the Pentecostal
[3:00:50] move this is not a Prosperity kind of
[3:00:55] gospel it is more than
[3:01:00] that is God coming
[3:01:04] again and restoring the light of his
[3:01:09] word back again to the
[3:01:12] church our hearts have been restored by
[3:01:15] this message
[3:01:18] and we have been put in a Rapture
[3:01:22] condition and day
[3:01:24] soon we are waiting for the resurrection
[3:01:28] morning because we have believed this
[3:01:31] truth because we have believed this
[3:01:34] word because we have accepted to walk
[3:01:37] with
[3:01:38] him we will be in the
