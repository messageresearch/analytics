========================================

[Music] I'm going to speak on something which affects most of us especially the younger generation the younger people the younger people really most of my summons if you've been following me really can help a lot of young people and I'm not saying it does not help the other ones but I trust that you to be of help now I want to speak on the spirit of delusion you see the spirit of delusion is a very cunning spirit is a very stubborn Spirit you see if I try to look into the dictionary to try and find the meaning of the word delusion foreign [Music] foreign Ty held despite the encode providable evidence to the contrary occurring especially in mental conditions a beliefs that someone holds and is convinced this is truth despite here he says they incontrovertible you know they despite the the uh explanations you tell him this is what he thinks is right you will show him evidence you will show him evidence infallible evidence you will prove to him Beyond reasonable what you are telling him is what I know is what is Right Church truth now that is the spirit and it's uh called delusion and mostly it is in mental cases conditions whereby someone is mentally challenged whereby they even here we take we call them Botanical cases and whereby they believe there's something and you know they believe maybe they are the president and you know those who started psychology they try to learn how to deal with such people questions you find different conditions some people who believe there's something you can just say I am Obama's Obama oh I am Trump who runs that Donald Trump Joy Biden Obama said Joy Biden I'm the president of America and you can't convince him otherwise jump for you to talk to him you need to salute to him respect to him now it's a condition it's a mental condition you know according to um medicine according to the Bible Bible is a spirit it's a spirit for you and it's called delusion not everyone gets this listen listen church not everyone gets the spirit of delusions but those who get the spirit of the illusion get it this way but God gives you the truth hallelujah man but when you say the truth you do not get to appreciate it so it comes only after rejecting the truth and that's why Believers of the word all over the world I love us of the truth you must always be a lover of the truth and I say what is the truth Jesus Christ is the true yes he said I am the way I am the truth no man can come to the father Jesus yes he's not here physically where is Jesus this is not a textbook kind of seek we have a lot of books that people call us textbooks or reference books or something like that those of you who have gone to University a lot of reference books this one here is more than just a reference this one is the book foreign [Applause] and Beyond this one there is no law praise the name of the Lord Hallelujah now this word much you know is what we believe us believe and anyone who doesn't believe this I think you need to bring it down a little bit it's vibrating I don't know who doesn't bring anyone who doesn't believe this word God will accept certain spirits to come and attack them and this spirits will be very strong that you can almost not break them it's called illusion people will start believing lies and to attend next single movie they will not actually know that they are believing lies that's what I want to prove to you this morning but the devil has tried to bring and you will see actually by the end of the service so many people deceived foreign therefore is now working in the children of disobedience [Music] at the beginning they are disobedient to the true word of God that's right they're disobedient to the true word of God the word of God is the Bible says when any man comes to God first you must believe that he is a rewarder of all those are diligently Seekers to follow whatever he tells you believe whatever he tells us don't come to go to the bed don't come to God to give him your opinion you don't come to God to suggest to him so what do you think you should do what do you think he should have done but when you come to God he wants you to submit whatever [Music] just cause a disbelief and their questions meant to desire knowledge but whoever needs knowledge or wisdom I guess the Bible says God gives it if you have a clean heart if you have an opinion God will answer all your questions but when you come and you don't understand a few things together [Music] am I talking to someone else you are going to heaven again on the blessings that you believe the whole world I may not understand everything here I tell you this I believe everything is a problem there's a there's a question I heard I have believed it As I Grew I grew the message I came to land that you see it was difficult for me to understand in my early years the first two years and I was preaching but I wasn't understanding I never preached about it because it wasn't coming it wasn't like coming to me I would I would preach it sometimes I see it but then when I go back and I read when I'm sharing with other people they begin to challenge me I can't understand so someone would come and tell you if God is who what was that voice yeah and yet Jesus is God yes of the father okay okay if Jesus was there was God why was he praying wasn't praying to he to the father that means there's another fact this is again the sin which cannot be forgiveness refusing to believe the world but the Bible says they that are born of God now soon I want to say that God is someone came out of a question that my daughter asked me Elizabeth came I don't know where she got the question from Elizabeth but she came and asked me why do some people use tattoos on their bodies [Music] some of these people are deluded and I want you to say that God is a master artist God loves arts and you see he made many creatures he met every creature in their own kinds and every creature was supposed to bring forth of its own kinds see some of the scriptures I have them on the screen God also made man in his own image the man was supposed to live or to be above all these creatures foreign [Music] then you foreign [Music] it is it is very fearful brother give me give me pleasure let us show the people a few things here because our nature our nature issue bring forth the image foreign [Music] people saw me with an elephant and I said are you sure it is a wild animals that elephant was not termed and we are supposed to be like putting a bed and a zoo we are supposed to live above all the Creations all these creatures why is it like the way it is and he has deceived the human race instead of believing the word of God give me this ladies brother hallelujah amen I hope everybody can see that now let

doubting so in the beginning God he created heaven and therefore for us we are just a little bit Katie fatally cartoon of the creation of God everything in heaven is just a part of God is much more than what foreign go to the previous look at those eyes look at the Blue Eyes the White Face very beautiful God was intentional I don't know how much time hallelujah amen oh my glory to God that's why the greatest artists we have in the world today most of them were actually inspired by God I'm saying you're gonna bring me a gun that gentleman what was this 33. [Music] that is so foreign watch it and that doesn't mean that you're not going to Prosperity some people think that if you're a Believer you sit on your gifts that's why I believe even if you have a gift of singing I sincerely believe you can actually record your music war and let it Bless the people if you have a gift don't just be there and everybody write your songs what is wrong with that foreign foreign are you looking at it look at all those spots wherever I am did you know that those sports are rhyming actually look at it again God knows how many sports because foreign and and and and you cannot reproduce it is and when that animal looks at you his eyes detailed you're not able to see at night it has night vision it's ears it can run and someone who could do faster than any other okay so fast eduka is Beauty is [Music] chameleon now God created this thing with all his understanding knowledge these things has abilities no man can replicate when it wants to eat and pull it's uh whatever but yet now you can see how long his tongue is all in that small creature this creature strongly is able to change its color choose a color depending on its environment it is what it needs foreign it is he ended up by saying and it is a beautiful one this is a beautiful piece now let me help you to appreciate it look at its eyes the way it is [Music] [Music] if you get it look at the next one what is this horse huh very beautiful it has a very nice hoof by the way it wasn't showed there but it has a very nice all right next slide hallelujah amen look at this chip very beautiful in the sight of God look at his lips [Music] very amazing about the eyes [Music] give me the next slide look at these birds oh my God I've seen people trying to mimic this Birds going on those wrong things and they try to work some of them they fall down but see God we put it in nature yeah give me the next slide Bridge Financial you didn't call that a flower foreign [Music] I've got it foreign [Music] give me that next Slide Man is in the image of God almost Genesis 1 25. Our God made the Beast of the earth yes after his kind the animals and cattle after their kind name and everything that creepeth upon the Earth after his comments and God so that it was good um everything I've shown and then when God finished then the Bible says let us make money in our image after our likeness what's going to be in the image music man moment will be the best designer and where it is going to be designed after the image of God for the likeness of God so God created man in his own image in the image but see this Hallelujah man hallelujah hallelujah I said hallelujah

Humanity foreign foreign some people people and I've been asked this question many times is there at a fashion that every believer should do [Music] no I don't believe there is a uniform fashion is telling us we should appreciate nature together [Music] now the question is a young man I was within Zimbabwe I thought he had put some stuff I was like wow it's beautiful to you for you to go to Saloon and begin wasting money and time no you're not understanding over there you want to look like feminists for you to go in someone and begin to do this is [Music] mine should be like yours nowhere in the scriptures keep your hair like yours yes be yourself you understand what I'm saying be yourself better if you like Shaolin as a Doctrine it is and it's okay some people naturally they they have a bald head body foreign they want to be like the past foreign there's a balance you have to strike give me the next slide please see this one now what do you see God has naturally created a monkey with its own lipstick cartoon is [Music] to go and want to be like monkeys get their lips I even don't know the men that matter these kind of words how they think yeah foreign now you might not like it but if the word says it if the word shows us the way and we are following the World Series God has gathered nature let me put it this way there are even some things what do you need to we don't need the word the Bible the words to tell us what I'm preaching today that's why I'm not even reading too much scriptures the Bible says doesn't even nature itself teach you foreign [Music] go back to the last one go back to it go back together yes now see this one and you find boys rushing to love girls and then you expect a woman with those kind of things to raise your children in the fear of God you are also deceived the woman that does it is whatever is inspiring she's trying to copy this and you will find that the spirit of this it might even be the one ruling foreign you say what is that pasta just shoes it is not just shoes whoever made it and whoever buys it has a at the speed of delusions to try and copy the other one is not good enough you should have feet like like the hoofs over of a horse so they will buy these ones and they will begin walking foreign [Music] foreign I I had to put this picture so you can be confused let me ask what is that what is this you see others yeah this is a snake right actually this is a man with a tattoo that's why the Bible does not allow people to use tattoos but the Devils rejecting the truth and then they go for this they are not happy with what God has made them okay buddy Elizabeth that's your answer that's why they do tattoos because they are deluded Satan to want what they are not and you find out everywhere you are in charge like here you may not have tattoos foreign hmm and then the devil will give you all up standing now but if you take God this way there's something that the father has not planted in you come he will approach it out I bet you could jump if it's a sickness that is making you tiny God and God Alone even the sickness making you fat and then you go and see yourself this is so black yeah I will not get tired who told you that the white are the one who are beautiful actually a good man will look for character not skin color amen Brothers a a good man will look for character not skin color or massage Pastor when you're preaching to us you are telling us that we should not look for beauty [Laughter] lies in the hands of the beholders [Music] sister and when they come for you when the white ones because you want to be the one their soul was longing [Applause] forever hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord give me the next slide next slide have you seen that what's the difference is the similarities you find a woman trying to mimic an ego you find them with all those longer nails like what you see there see God gave an eagle such Nails in order for it to get its place you don't need actually sister with those kind of nails you can't even eat if you eat you can easily become sick I wonder how they even keep hygiene with us and the devil is destroying a generation I say we as Believers of this world let us stay above the spirits live Above This is for we cannot be overtaken by them praise the name of the Lord living a life you can now decide what gender they want to be somebody it comes from what we have been saying how can a good understanding man or massage and you find them because I'm reaching my climax when we get done with this getting posters foreign are beginning to persecute those who say anything against them when I was in South Africa I told the people you see because in South Africa they're like almost in the US but in Uganda we think yeah we are still okay but let me tell you we are not okay to believe in life they themselves will control the world because this is their Heritage before the bread comes down they're going to take the take over the whole world um they are the ones with the money sister foreign think about it now you are saying that is so bad and the first things I was showing you were saying that's okay hey you are joking the devil is at it he has been at it from the beginning [Music] to pervert their minds even in school children their mind will become perverted in our society that's why you told women to wear trousers so that they can think their men you thought him in the beginning it was a style because now you know better because there is a wrong speed behind it they started by saying women have rights and then finally they said is the spirit of delusion and it's the Looting the whole generation listen to me no one will survive the mark of Christ the spirit of delusion mankind you can now decide whether they are a cow a monkey a donkey a lizard or something um someone saying for me I've discovered that since I was born I'm feeling uh like a monkey [Music] I feel pretty from beginning with today I am registering in the government as a man no [Music] you think I'm joking it is already in the world is a strong religion is imagine terrorism I'm going to nail this properly Generations as long as they have consented so whether we are married or not we can do whatever we like because the spirit of the illusion you have no rights kissing a man a woman who is not your husband or wife you have no rights sleeping with someone else's wife because whoever is not yet married for a husband someone else is there and if you are the one don't marry them the Bible says to you young men and women if you born what's up that is the Bible solution that's why Rwanda married foreign [Music] no brother this is the word so you find a pasta that's why you hear the stories that's why here days of the voice sisters alone you have no business we believe in Holiness it is a beautiful thing tomorrow you will build our society [Music] think about marriage who are very serious they said on these things when a young man comes past them brother you have a spirit of life I don't believe that I don't believe that but Pastor you're not married you also have a spirit of life I believe that we should take the word the way it is [Music] I don't believe that kind of thing too mature adults can decide to do anything tell somebody that's alive you see they say anybody can believe whatever they like as long as they believe it they are right no that's a lie baptism baptizing babies he's alive no matter how many people do it baptizing babies I say this is only one baptism of water um that the Bible says any other thing is a lie of the devil Guru all right I have two more slides now okay of two scriptures Romans 1 21. because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither we are thankful but became vain in their own imaginations and their foolish Hearts heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools [Music] [Music] the professor they profess to be wise and the Bible says they became fools brother foreign and they begin you know you know it's all right to have those nails they profess to be wise but they became full Neighbors you see why am I preaching this because we have a responsibility to tell you these things it's a it's a responsibility given to us by God the spirit of delusion over an entire generation and and people are becoming fools and it says their foolish Hearts were stuck imaginations [Music] here is what it is Lord we have sinned all night and taken nothing nevertheless at Thy word there you are taking God at his word and I'm saying take God at his word church it is taking God at his word not what you taste what this says that all that says I'm taking God at his words I don't know how they're going to be there but if there wasn't any there and Peter let down the net with faith believing that God would fulfill his word faith would put some there singer yeah I want to finish with this church Hallelujah man we are believers we are like Peter during a pet I said we are believers tell somebody Hallelujah if we believe I tell your neighbor I'm a Believer don't worry anymore Peter had what Jesus said he said we have been casting we've not found any fish but he said [Music] I believe it is I am fearful commander and wonderfully made not only one and Ken peace I'm challenging some of you now I don't know how many will catch it how many will believe it how many will accept it do you know you can start your company million dollar company a company and you know if there is no job it's for you God can make you create some jobs even for others did you know God our God the God of this message he specializes he is not looking for possibilities [Applause] while I'm speaking that I'm having many Revelations which I can't remember it is time rather begin playing something come on musicians which is time search it you know our vision of course welcome to be accomplished if you stick in the world I will bring those that word which I said in beginning if you stick in the naturals is going to be natural enough because the God of this message what he has done for others he can do for you what is impossible that man cannot do it that's why we are believers amen even what what is so complicated in your family in your life can make it Hallelujah something that you never expected because our God Church situations he takes ugly situations and he makes them nice ones nice food and known she makes them nice ones that's why we believe the word if your situation is ugly I want you to believe with me right now I want you to believe with me right now God is able to take it because you believe the truth he will not bring the spirit of delusion to you the Bible says what will the truth do what will the truth do brother said you free foreign [Music] don't whisper to God speak the words pray away your problems pray away your problems let the spirit of Truth set you free
