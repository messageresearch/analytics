[49:36] morning before we change the order of
[49:38] the

[49:42] presence of our Elder who is
[49:46] [Music]
[49:52] here let us give a mighty hand of Praise
[49:55] amen amen
[49:57] you
[49:58] know uh I know we are
[50:02] young and uh we we like saying we are
[50:06] the
[50:09] generation they
[50:10] failed we are going to make
[50:14] it
[50:16] well we can be excited with
[50:20] that and actually we could prosper in
[50:22] many ways that they failed
[50:27] and you know if you don't Prosper more
[50:29] than your father your father did not do
[50:30] a good
[50:33] job but because you
[50:35] prosper more than him it means he did a
[50:40] good
[50:43] job I would want to say
[50:45] this
[50:47] uh I'm 33 years
[50:52] old are you okay to speak your age
[50:56] brother Glover is 28 years
[51:01] old many of you are like really come
[51:04] [Music]
[51:06] on yes is the
[51:09] TR and many of you here are below
[51:15] 40 a few older
[51:17] ones and so I want to
[51:33] so don't D my
[51:35] point and so there's something I'm
[51:37] trying to say
[51:40] here there is nothing we can
[51:44] be without a solid
[51:49] foundation how many agree with
[51:52] me without a solid
[51:54] foundation we cannot become
[51:59] and if we do not appreciate the men of
[52:03] God used before
[52:06] us we cannot amount to
[52:10] anything right and so this
[52:14] morning I want us to stand up because
[52:18] Pastor
[52:20] Steven is um one of the first generation
[52:23] Elders in Uganda
[52:28] personally I did not come to the message
[52:30] through his
[52:33] ministry but the people that I came
[52:37] through the message the message
[52:40] through you find that they were touched
[52:43] by his
[52:45] ministry and so are
[52:47] yours you may not even know him maybe
[52:51] where you come from but back there you
[52:55] realize that these Elders were
[53:00] interconnected and because of
[53:02] them we can have what we are
[53:06] having so let us stand up clap our hands
[53:11] receive
[53:12] Pastor to come and us
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:18] for usap Hees here
[53:26] [Music]
[53:31] [Applause]
[53:34] God God bless
[53:37] you God bless you amen you may be
[53:42] seated ah I'm
[53:48] humbled and
[53:50] uh thank you for those rare
[53:55] words amen
[54:00] um I don't know where to start
[54:04] from but I want to bring
[54:08] greetings from the Saints back
[54:15] home they knew that both I and my wife
[54:19] Sarah would be here this
[54:23] morning and they are praying for this
[54:25] meeting
[54:28] I'm
[54:28] happy to have gathered
[54:31] together with the new wine
[54:37] bottles it can
[54:39] bubble it can
[54:43] bubble it can
[54:45] swell it cannot
[54:49] break I'm happy to have come among young
[54:54] people
[54:56] amen it's the change of
[54:59] [Music]
[55:01] order but each time we came to a
[55:04] junction
[55:08] of there was an
[55:12] overlap so the former
[55:16] age flew into the new
[55:20] age and the new
[55:22] age flows back into the old age
[55:27] so I want to
[55:28] say there will be something you
[55:32] need for the new
[55:35] age from this old
[55:41] wine that's the way God
[55:43] works that's the way God
[55:46] works and I'm really
[55:49] thankful that I've been part of the
[55:52] David
[55:54] generation fight to build the
[55:58] [Music]
[55:59] kingdom but when Solomon
[56:02] comes the kingdom of
[56:05] Peace must be seen speaking
[56:09] peace let the days of battle
[56:13] cease and let the Solomon
[56:17] Kingdom prove to be the kingdom of
[56:21] [Music]
[56:22] Sol that's the way we can
[56:25] go so I really want to appreciate you
[56:28] young
[56:29] people the generation of the
[56:33] upright that are fighting
[56:36] on to bring down the coming of the
[56:41] Kingdom I certainly appreciate
[56:44] you knowing we carry one
[56:48] anointing the anointing of the
[56:51] ego remember the ego never gets old
[56:57] as as young as you
[57:00] are I'm young as you
[57:04] are I know how to renew my
[57:08] anointing there is something about
[57:11] anego it always carries this brotherly
[57:16] love when it sees the older
[57:20] eego it doesn't pick it
[57:23] out but it comes feeds it
[57:27] we've got something
[57:28] new and then this old
[57:31] eag we eat on the new thing and become
[57:35] young
[57:36] again let me tell you we are an
[57:40] everlasting youthful
[57:44] age youth is an
[57:47] attitude the attitude of Cal that takes
[57:50] the so I appreciate you greet you young
[57:54] people Keep Holding On fight on to the
[57:59] coming of the
[58:01] Lord don't be

[58:54] you brother app
[58:56] Shalom God
[58:59] [Applause]
[59:02] bless now listen to me there is
[59:04] something I want to
[59:06] say one time in our
[59:10] church I preached a sermon titled sowing
[59:14] honor and reaping access
[59:26] problem that our generation
[59:29] has we do not
[59:32] H older people whether they men of
[59:37] God or our
[59:39] parents some of you are here you you you
[59:42] look down on your
[59:44] parents respect them and you know it you
[59:49] know it while you're looking at me
[59:53] you but it blocks access to many things
[59:57] in your
[1:00:02] life is a Biblical
[1:00:05] principle trust I finish this in two
[1:00:10] minutes
[1:00:13] listen God revealed this to
[1:00:16] me when I was starting out on
[1:00:19] Ministry and it has helped me a
[1:00:23] lot you know Pentecostal
[1:00:26] they know how to honor their men of
[1:00:30] God better than message
[1:00:33] belever in the message if a pastor is
[1:00:37] not your
[1:00:39] pastor even when you meet him on the
[1:00:42] road say how are
[1:00:45] you when you meet your
[1:00:50] pastor if God has called a man to be a
[1:00:54] pastor not a pastor to his local
[1:00:57] assembly he's a pastor to the entire
[1:01:00] body of
[1:01:03] Christ if if a man is a Deon same
[1:01:07] thing if a man is a singer a
[1:01:11] woman I
[1:01:12] mean could be Ministry Administration
[1:01:17] gift into the entire body of Jesus
[1:01:20] [Music]
[1:01:22] Christ and if our
[1:01:24] generation can learn to give
[1:01:27] honor we are going to have a limitless
[1:01:33] access and I will seal those words with
[1:01:35] the
[1:01:38] testimony um I spent very many
[1:01:42] years brother Ed I know this is
[1:01:45] public and I know Pastor Sten you do not
[1:01:48] know
[1:01:50] this um the testimony you know what
[1:01:52] happened but you don't know the
[1:01:54] testimony I spent many
[1:01:56] years but the Edis first invited me to
[1:01:59] Canada in
[1:02:02] 2012 and I applied for
[1:02:05] Visa I was
[1:02:07] young um you know still in school my
[1:02:11] Visa was turned
[1:02:14] down I I was invited again and
[1:02:19] again maybe three or four five
[1:02:22] times and my Visa kept on being rejected
[1:02:27] now don't there's a reason why I'm
[1:02:28] sharing this
[1:02:32] Tes I was only applying for a visa to go
[1:02:35] and
[1:02:38] Minister I was not going to do
[1:02:42] jobs but my Visa was turned
[1:02:47] down but one day something
[1:02:52] happened Pastor I has been traveling you
[1:02:55] know in Ministry around the world since
[1:02:57] the
[1:03:02] 80s and he has wor out many passports
[1:03:08] and and so now he had a new passport and
[1:03:11] he needed a
[1:03:14] Visa so he called me up at that time I'm
[1:03:17] a
[1:03:19] pastor of my own church you know we like
[1:03:23] saying uh when you the of the local
[1:03:31] church so he called me
[1:03:35] up and he told me brother
[1:03:38] bus I'd like you to help
[1:03:40] me uh apply for a new
[1:03:44] Visa these things are
[1:03:46] complicated online and all that I want
[1:03:49] you to come and help me do
[1:03:53] that so when he told me that
[1:03:56] because of what I just told
[1:03:58] you I told my wife I don't know what God
[1:04:01] is
[1:04:02] up but if Pastor has asked me to come
[1:04:05] and
[1:04:07] help there must be something God is
[1:04:11] cooking I didn't even tell him right
[1:04:13] away I put fuel in my
[1:04:16] car I
[1:04:21] didn't aor why are you calling me
[1:04:25] don't you know that I'm also an
[1:04:30] elder I know I'm trying to kill some
[1:04:32] demons
[1:04:35] here
[1:04:37] listen I put Fel I didn't ask him for
[1:04:40] fuel I put
[1:04:42] fuel in my own
[1:04:45] car and I drove to
[1:04:48] Ginger and we were there the whole
[1:04:51] day and she he was planning to travel
[1:04:55] with
[1:04:56] mama and so we sorted all those
[1:05:00] things and um he we we placed in the um
[1:05:06] the application
[1:05:08] for now his Visa took so long I think a
[1:05:12] year two
[1:05:15] years before it you know he received a
[1:05:20] feedback and so he kept on asking me to
[1:05:23] check and I kept on ask
[1:05:26] to see whether his Visa
[1:05:28] came and there was no
[1:05:31] response and one day when he when he
[1:05:33] told me to
[1:05:34] check and I checked I Heard a Voice
[1:05:37] speak to
[1:05:38] me he said it's the it's the time I had
[1:05:42] been sent the last
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:45] invitation I had it in my
[1:05:47] file and I I I felt I will not apply for
[1:05:51] this thing again is heartbreaking you
[1:05:53] know
[1:05:55] you put in your time and then they say
[1:06:00] rejected I said no Uganda is the best
[1:06:03] country on Earth after
[1:06:05] all I don't need to travel anywhere to
[1:06:09] be important I can be important in my
[1:06:13] own I said I will not apply for
[1:06:16] this so I kept the letter but while I
[1:06:20] checked his
[1:06:22] Visa the a voice spoke to me he said the
[1:06:27] time apply your
[1:06:29] Visa because of what you have
[1:06:32] done you are going to get a
[1:06:34] Visa now it just a voice that I
[1:06:38] had so I told my wife about it she said
[1:06:42] go ahead and so I
[1:06:44] applied three months I had my Visa 3
[1:06:49] months now remember he took two
[1:06:52] years in three months I got Visa until
[1:06:57] my passport
[1:07:01] expires I can TR as much as I want as
[1:07:04] long as I
[1:07:06] want now some of you are very rightous
[1:07:10] you are saying pastor you're giving a
[1:07:12] Visa
[1:07:16] testimony every testimony is a
[1:07:19] testimony but right now I'm giving you a

[1:13:56] country praise the Lord
[1:13:59] amen yes and thanks for the words that
[1:14:02] you have said about respect to the
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:09] elders and I also want to thank
[1:14:13] the for his words of
[1:14:21] wisdom amen May the name of the Lord be
[1:14:23] blessed
[1:14:25] and uh I know that I have no time
[1:14:27] because the time is
[1:14:31] gone but I just want them to read the
[1:14:37] scripture and read a few
[1:14:41] quotes and
[1:14:43] close if you can stand upon your feet we
[1:14:46] can read together the scripture I want
[1:14:48] us to open to the Book of John 1 verse
[1:14:51] one
[1:14:56] a very familiar
[1:15:00] scripture a very loaded
[1:15:04] scripture but I not going to unpack it I
[1:15:08] am not going to unpack
[1:15:11] it I would just mention
[1:15:19] it to verse three in the beginning was
[1:15:23] the word and the word was with God and
[1:15:26] the Word was God the same was in the
[1:15:29] beginning with God all things were made
[1:15:32] by him and without him was not anything
[1:15:35] made that was made
[1:15:55] pray that we read John 14 again John
[1:15:59] 14 verse
[1:16:02] 20 amen it says here um at that day you
[1:16:07] shall know that I am in my father and in
[1:16:12] me and I in you
[1:16:30] [Music]
[1:16:33] I want to speak
[1:16:36] on the the title the logos has a
[1:16:46] [Music]
[1:16:50] part
[1:16:52] amen yes the logos has a part
[1:16:56] Theos
[1:17:06] a blessed be the name of the Lorden so
[1:17:10] uh the prophet um has taught us many
[1:17:15] things in fact the entire
[1:17:18] Bible because we are living in the days
[1:17:21] of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:17:27] and that seventh angel is the Angel also
[1:17:30] or is the prophet of Malachi
[1:17:35] 4 God was going to send just before that
[1:17:38] great and Dreadful day of the
[1:17:42] Lord amen so Mal is a prophet to the end
[1:17:46] time
[1:17:50] generation just before the
[1:17:53] rapture but according to Revelation
[1:17:57] 10 he shall also finish the mysteries of
[1:18:02] God and the prophet says it is this
[1:18:05] divinely revealed mystery
[1:18:11] truths that will literally T the hearts
[1:18:13] of the children back to the
[1:18:20] fathers amen the prophet says this this
[1:18:23] this this
[1:18:25] prophet of Mal will do two
[1:18:31] things number one he will turn the
[1:18:33] hearts of the
[1:18:35] people of
[1:18:37] children back to the
[1:18:39] fathers number two he will finish the
[1:18:44] Mysteries then it is this divinely
[1:18:47] revealed mystery
[1:18:51] truths that will be the vehicle for
[1:18:53] turning us back to the
[1:18:59] fathers so the revelation of the
[1:19:01] word the opening of the
[1:19:04] book is the means by which our hearts
[1:19:07] attend to the
[1:19:11] fathers so he is a
[1:19:14] prophet that we
[1:19:17] received amen and he occupied so many
[1:19:19] spaces in the
[1:19:22] Bible because the prophet was supposed
[1:19:24] to be the word to
[1:19:29] us he was a son of
[1:19:31] men revealing the son of
[1:19:34] man and with the gift that God gave
[1:19:38] him which was the sign of the
[1:19:41] Messiah which was the word of Hebrews
[1:19:45] 4:12 which will the hearts of the
[1:19:49] people he was the
[1:19:52] Messiah who came in John 4
[1:19:57] well and saw that
[1:19:59] woman of
[1:20:01] Samaria and he began to talk to
[1:20:04] her the woman spoke to him and he spoke
[1:20:08] to the
[1:20:09] woman and he said woman give me
[1:20:13] drink the woman said we have no
[1:20:16] relationship Samaritans and Jews don't
[1:20:19] have
[1:20:20] relationship but Jesus began to converse
[1:20:22] with her
[1:20:25] and the woman had said you are a
[1:20:27] Jew and I am a
[1:20:30] Samaritan but when they began to speak
[1:20:32] to each other the woman changed her
[1:20:35] attitude she began not to say you are a
[1:20:39] Jew but she
[1:20:41] said he was now
[1:20:44] a then they went on he said I
[1:20:47] perceive you are not just a but you are
[1:20:50] a
[1:20:51] prophet because the word of God
[1:20:55] come to a
[1:20:57] prophet and she went on to say not only
[1:21:01] are you a
[1:21:02] prophet not only are you a prophet but
[1:21:05] we know that when Messiah
[1:21:07] cometh he will show us these things
[1:21:10] because Jesus Christ was the
[1:21:14] prophet spoken about by
[1:21:16] Moses in
[1:21:18] Deuteronomy mes say the Lord your God
[1:21:22] shall raise up a prophet
[1:21:25] like unto me so this woman knew that
[1:21:30] this
[1:21:30] man was a prophet and she went beyond
[1:21:34] that when Messiah would come he will
[1:21:38] show us the sign of the
[1:21:39] Messiah and that was the sign of the
[1:21:42] Messiah to the
[1:21:44] Samaritan but Jesus Christ had
[1:21:48] demonstrated the sign of the Messiah to
[1:21:51] the
[1:21:52] Jew first of all
[1:21:55] demonstrated it to the Jew Philip find
[1:22:01] Nathaniel we have found him who MOS
[1:22:04] speaks about in the law we have found
[1:22:08] him the Messiah and Nathaniel said who
[1:22:12] is this Messiah where does he come from
[1:22:16] because we know nothing good comes out
[1:22:20] of Nazareth and Philip said come and see
[1:22:25] come and see the prophet says that is
[1:22:28] the best
[1:22:29] answer you can give to a man come and
[1:22:34] see Jesus did it one day John sent two
[1:22:40] disciples go and ask him are you the one
[1:22:44] to come or shall we look for another
[1:22:48] Jesus did not answer them he said come
[1:22:51] to my
[1:22:52] service come to church
[1:22:55] come to church come and see it says go
[1:22:59] and tell
[1:23:00] John what you hear and what you see I
[1:23:05] have
[1:23:06] heard with the hearing of the ear but
[1:23:10] now I
[1:23:12] see and Jesus began to
[1:23:15] demonstrate the spoken word says in
[1:23:18] Isaiah
[1:23:21] 61 the sick
[1:23:24] being healed the BL eyes they are being
[1:23:28] opened the dead they are being raised
[1:23:32] and Jesus Christ stopped he said go
[1:23:37] tell the SI are being healed the gopel
[1:23:41] is being preached to the poor the eyes
[1:23:43] of the blind are being
[1:23:46] opened and he said blessed is he that is
[1:23:49] not offended in me you know the Bible is
[1:23:52] so precise
[1:23:55] when Jesus demonstrated what he
[1:23:58] demonstrated that was written in
[1:24:01] Isaiah omitted one thing in Isaiah the
[1:24:05] Bible goes on to
[1:24:06] say and the
[1:24:09] prisoners are being brought out of
[1:24:11] prison so Jesus did not talk about that
[1:24:15] because John was in prison and John to
[1:24:18] say why am I not coming out if the
[1:24:21] prisoners are coming out
[1:24:26] and Jesus not touch that because John
[1:24:29] was in prison it was not the
[1:24:32] time that time for the prison door to
[1:24:35] open so Jesus was very
[1:24:39] precise he did did the same thing in in
[1:24:42] chapter 4 of The Book of
[1:24:46] Luke when he came from the Wilderness he
[1:24:49] was given a book of Isaiah and he went
[1:24:53] to the scripture
[1:24:55] the spirit of the Lord is upon me he has
[1:24:58] anointed me to preach the gospel to
[1:25:02] preach Liberty to open blind eyes and to
[1:25:05] help those that are
[1:25:08] oppressed and to preach the acceptable
[1:25:11] year of the
[1:25:12] Lord he put a full
[1:25:15] stop where he put a full
[1:25:18] stop where there were supposed to be a
[1:25:21] coma in the book of Isaiah
[1:25:24] he pred acceptable
[1:25:26] year and he not say the year of
[1:25:31] venance the first coming of Jesus Christ
[1:25:35] was the sound of the trumpet of
[1:25:39] Jubilee and the prophet says in chapter
[1:25:43] 4 of The Book of Luke he was announcing
[1:25:47] a coming
[1:25:50] Jubilee and when did the Jubilee come
[1:25:54] he says it came on the day of
[1:25:57] Pentecost 50 days from the DAT of
[1:26:02] Ascension from the 50 days from the de
[1:26:06] of
[1:26:07] resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus
[1:26:11] rose from the dead he spent 40
[1:26:14] days on the earth here showing by
[1:26:18] infallible
[1:26:19] [Music]
[1:26:21] proofs from the dead
[1:26:24] the 40th Day he
[1:26:27] ascended but he said in
[1:26:30] Jerusalem until we endured with
[1:26:33] power so they Ted for 10
[1:26:36] days after the
[1:26:39] Ascension to make it 50
[1:26:42] days after the
[1:26:44] resurrection so the day of Pentecost was
[1:26:47] the day of the Jubilee
[1:26:50] trumpet it was the day of the 50th
[1:26:55] it was the 50th day which was the day of
[1:26:58] Pentecost and the Holy Ghost came to
[1:27:02] give him a
[1:27:03] Jubilee May the name of the Lord be
[1:27:05] blessed and when the gospel is
[1:27:08] sounded that is the Jubilee
[1:27:12] trumpet now you don't have to wait for
[1:27:14] 50 days now you don't have to wait for
[1:27:17] 50 years every day when the scripture is
[1:27:22] preached that is the
[1:27:24] in of the T of
[1:27:27] Jubilee every scripture you read you
[1:27:30] have got a right on wrting it to drop
[1:27:34] down the
[1:27:35] hole and say Satan you can't touch me
[1:27:39] anymore I have heard the written and God
[1:27:45] has spoken to me this is the hour of my
[1:27:50] departure when the word is
[1:27:52] preached that is the hour
[1:27:55] of your departure from possession or
[1:27:59] oppression or
[1:28:03] oppression blessed be the name of the
[1:28:06] Lord and we
[1:28:08] know we know when a man went into Decay
[1:28:13] as the Bible says if you were
[1:28:15] poor and you lost your
[1:28:17] inheritance you had two
[1:28:20] options one of them if you could pay if
[1:28:24] you had a relative if you had if you had
[1:28:27] a close Redeemer if you had a close
[1:28:31] Kinsman who was rich he could pay for
[1:28:35] you he could redeem the thing not for
[1:28:39] himself but back to you you are not able
[1:28:44] to get back your property but a kidsman
[1:28:47] comes he gets it
[1:28:50] back not for himself but for you
[1:28:54] [Music]
[1:28:55] do you hear that that was number one way
[1:28:59] of redeeming your
[1:29:01] property then number two you were
[1:29:04] supposed to look at the
[1:29:06] calendar simply look at the calendar
[1:29:09] count the number of years count the 10th
[1:29:12] day of the seventh month there was a
[1:29:16] priest who go into every
[1:29:19] village every
[1:29:21] settlement with a trumpet he will Trum
[1:29:24] he will sound it when you heard it your
[1:29:29] freedom was because you have heard it
[1:29:32] your freedom was because you hat it not
[1:29:36] because you paid because there was a
[1:29:38] sounding of the
[1:29:40] Trum and when the tri
[1:29:43] sounded if the task
[1:29:45] master had told you to go up and
[1:29:48] tree to Pi a m of fruit for
[1:29:52] him take a m
[1:29:55] and when you were like stretching your
[1:29:56] head like this and you heard the trumpet
[1:30:01] it was now your grace to continue to
[1:30:04] pick it otherwise you could just come
[1:30:08] down the tree and say did you not hear
[1:30:11] that it sounded I'm no longer a slave
[1:30:15] from the sounding of the trumpet I'm no
[1:30:18] longer a
[1:30:20] slave and the Bible says when they will
[1:30:23] to return
[1:30:24] they would not go empty away because a
[1:30:27] 7th year it was a release of the
[1:30:31] Lord and the prophet says the jubile
[1:30:35] trumpet amen the return the return the
[1:30:40] return was not because of you it was not
[1:30:44] because of the man because it was
[1:30:47] according it says it was a Act of
[1:30:50] God it was a Act of God
[1:30:54] it was the act of God it was the act of
[1:30:58] God and you are going to go out not
[1:31:02] because you are righteous not because
[1:31:04] you are holy not because you can but
[1:31:08] it's an act of God that one is an
[1:31:14] amnesty every president has got the
[1:31:18] powers to issue a clency
[1:31:22] order amesty
[1:31:24] to say those that were
[1:31:26] convicted of such a crime and such a
[1:31:29] crime those that were sentenced to so
[1:31:31] many
[1:31:33] years the courts were
[1:31:36] right to find you
[1:31:38] guilty the evidence was right to prove
[1:31:42] you guilty and the sentence against you
[1:31:45] was
[1:31:46] correct but by the powers rested in me
[1:31:51] as the Commander in Chief
[1:31:54] I write a
[1:31:56] pattern and when a pattern is
[1:31:59] written whether you are
[1:32:01] guilty I not guilty it's time to go
[1:32:07] away
[1:32:09] amen yet there was evidence against
[1:32:12] you you were properly
[1:32:14] convicted you properly found guilty but
[1:32:17] the president has
[1:32:19] powers to say I paron
[1:32:22] you and
[1:32:24] pardon is not a pardon unless it is
[1:32:28] received and
[1:32:30] accepted as a pardon the triet of
[1:32:35] Jubilee is not a tri of Jubilee unless
[1:32:38] it is accepted as a tret of
[1:32:42] Jubilee behold I sent you
[1:32:46] Elijah behold I sent you the
[1:32:49] trumpet if you accept the trumpet you
[1:32:53] Exempted from
[1:32:57] Amon byass
[1:33:00] Amon because you have listened to a
[1:33:04] trumpet this Redemption Now by a
[1:33:08] Kingsman Redeemer was not for the
[1:33:11] Kinsman it was for the man who was
[1:33:15] poor that's why when Adam lost the
[1:33:18] book when he lost the
[1:33:21] book he went into destitution
[1:33:25] but one day a man
[1:33:28] came born of a v woman and died on the
[1:33:32] cross and he said it is finished he was
[1:33:36] paying the price the price of
[1:33:40] redemption that is not where we were
[1:33:43] redeemed that is not where the claims
[1:33:46] were
[1:33:48] made I want you to follow me amen he
[1:33:51] paid the price
[1:33:54] but you know if you go to a
[1:33:56] shop and you pay for your
[1:33:58] furniture it can remain there unless you
[1:34:02] come to take it to claim it but he paid
[1:34:05] the price to free the
[1:34:09] commodity to free the
[1:34:12] item but in chapter five of The Book of
[1:34:16] Revelation John was weeping and yet the
[1:34:20] price was paid already why was he
[1:34:22] weeping
[1:34:24] because what was redeemed had not yet
[1:34:27] been claimed it had just been paid
[1:34:30] for I want you to know when Jesus died
[1:34:34] on the cross yes he paid the
[1:34:37] price but he did not redeem the
[1:34:40] world because the book was not yet
[1:34:43] opened where he was going to claim the
[1:34:46] things for which he had paid the
[1:34:49] price John was
[1:34:52] weeping why he weeping and already died
[1:34:57] but there was need for a
[1:34:59] man to come and
[1:35:01] claim the contents of the book there was
[1:35:04] need for a man to come and open the book
[1:35:08] in order for you to see your
[1:35:10] inheritance your inheritance is not in
[1:35:13] the first pool it's not in the second
[1:35:15] pool it's in the fullness of the
[1:35:18] world and when you see your name you see
[1:35:21] your name of
[1:35:24] written in the book and the prophet says
[1:35:28] no man was Worthy open the book but yet
[1:35:32] Jesus Christ was busy
[1:35:34] interceding in the background he was
[1:35:37] interceding in the background clearing
[1:35:40] the
[1:35:42] names in the book your name was being
[1:35:47] cleared
[1:35:49] intercessor and John who was
[1:35:52] weeping he stopped
[1:35:55] not because the has
[1:35:59] prevailed not just to die on the cross
[1:36:02] but to
[1:36:03] claim has prevailed to open the book to
[1:36:08] lose the C there of then in chapter 10
[1:36:13] what was closed in chapter
[1:36:14] 5 is now cut
[1:36:17] open in chapter
[1:36:20] 10 do you
[1:36:22] hear when Jesus Christ was in the
[1:36:25] temple and he opened the book he closed
[1:36:29] it and gave it back to the minister he
[1:36:32] closed it and gave it back to the
[1:36:33] minister but in chapter 10 when the book
[1:36:36] was opened it never went back to being
[1:36:39] closed it came down as an open book
[1:36:44] where you and I can see our names
[1:36:46] clearly and we now know that we are the
[1:36:49] sons and daughters of God not because we
[1:36:52] wanted
[1:36:54] but he chose us he elected us he prested
[1:36:58] us before the foundation of the world
[1:37:00] and what are we today we are an
[1:37:03] attribute of God being made manifest you
[1:37:07] are a part of God you were there before
[1:37:11] the foundation of the world you were
[1:37:14] shouting in the mind of God and you came
[1:37:18] down here to manifest him and what are
[1:37:21] we doing now we fellowshipping with the
[1:37:25] father we are fellowshipping with the
[1:37:28] father amen the bride is the
[1:37:32] part of
[1:37:36] Theos we are different from the
[1:37:40] Pentecostals they just believe in the
[1:37:43] blood but we have the
[1:37:45] token the life of the blood the b word
[1:37:51] is what saves us is what puts us in the
[1:37:57] Rapture glory to God the bleeding word
[1:38:01] is the Jesus of the message Jesus is not
[1:38:04] just a name Jesus is the word and we are
[1:38:10] the
[1:38:11] word made
[1:38:12] manifest because the word is a thought
[1:38:17] expressed the thought of God being
[1:38:21] expressed here
[1:38:23] cannot lose you without losing his
[1:38:26] thoughts because you are the thought of
[1:38:29] God you are the mind of God God can not
[1:38:33] lose you without losing his mind but the
[1:38:37] thoughts of God are
[1:38:39] Eternal is eternal as God is
[1:38:44] eternal you are can't be
[1:38:46] lost you can't be lost you came back you
[1:38:50] came from God you go back to God
[1:38:54] you have got the
[1:38:55] glory of the Father which you had with
[1:38:59] him before the foundation of the world
[1:39:02] you were in the logos you were in the
[1:39:05] mind of God as Jesus
[1:39:08] condescended you also
[1:39:10] condescended but you bypassed
[1:39:14] your you came from God you came from
[1:39:19] thought to flesh Jesus came from thought
[1:39:23] to Lo and to flesh but you came from God
[1:39:29] to to flesh but Jesus Christ came

[2:02:23] Adam the church is is is a part of Jesus
[2:02:27] Christ and you are an attribute of your
[2:02:33] grandfather so that is now being
[2:02:37] manifested amen blessed be the name of
[2:02:40] the Lord so then he says all these
[2:02:43] things the prophet he is doing this to
[2:02:45] build our
[2:02:47] faith to know that we are
[2:02:49] God who are manifested of God are the
[2:02:53] children of God he says your life was
[2:02:56] pre-planned pre-planned
[2:03:01] nothing happens by
[2:03:04] chance you are here because of the
[2:03:06] Eternal thoughts of
[2:03:12] God knew you were going to be
[2:03:16] here actually attached your name to the
[2:03:19] seventh angel message
[2:03:24] message in this
[2:03:25] generation so you are Malachi
[2:03:28] 4 a part
[2:03:31] of he says I sent
[2:03:34] you you Elijah so Elijah and you are
[2:03:40] Mal because you could not have accepted
[2:03:43] the word if you not attached to
[2:03:47] Mal Prophet says Elijah went to the
[2:03:50] Widow's house
[2:03:52] because that was of the caliber of
[2:03:57] Elijah you the C of
[2:04:00] Elijah that's why Elijah came to your
[2:04:04] house that's why you are eating
[2:04:05] spiritual
[2:04:09] food that's right amen now the prophet
[2:04:12] now I want you to see this uh just to to
[2:04:15] minister to your needs
[2:04:17] [Music]
[2:04:19] now by what the prophet has done done to
[2:04:22] other
[2:04:23] people you know when I was coming
[2:04:27] here I was issue that
[2:04:32] [Music]
[2:04:35] I issue was
[2:04:40] complicated and one of those issues was
[2:04:43] there was a need of some
[2:04:46] fig us
[2:04:53] so I I I just woke up in the
[2:04:55] morning went to my
[2:04:58] bookshelf I did not switch the lights
[2:05:01] on I just went and picked a
[2:05:05] book took it to the living
[2:05:08] room where I wanted to read and to
[2:05:11] pray when I go to the living room and
[2:05:13] the lights were
[2:05:15] on it was be certain of God
[2:05:22] then I opened the
[2:05:24] book
[2:05:27] randomly without reading the pages
[2:05:31] as then as I opened
[2:05:34] it then it fell my eyes fell on this
[2:05:38] quotation
[2:05:40] here I I I thought it was to minister to
[2:05:42] my needs at that
[2:05:47] time when the pastor yesterday mentioned
[2:05:50] something to do with the need for others
[2:05:52] to be assisted by God in that line I

[2:18:27] you're guilty I justy you in Jesus
[2:18:34] name now I'm not reading this I'm just
[2:18:37] quoting it to you there was a brother
[2:18:39] called double I'm not reading
[2:18:41] it this double was a
[2:18:45] businessman and he was a
[2:18:47] contractor cont cont build things for
[2:18:53] government so he came to the prophet he
[2:18:56] says he wanted to build a post
[2:18:59] office but there was a man of
[2:19:02] God who told him don't take that
[2:19:06] contract because the Russians will come
[2:19:08] and run over
[2:19:10] it they will come through
[2:19:13] Canada to the US but and will clean the
[2:19:17] whole British Colombia out as they come
[2:19:19] down so don't take that
[2:19:24] contract the prophet says the prophet
[2:19:26] says I went and
[2:19:29] prayed and the brother had said oh
[2:19:32] brother
[2:19:33] Bram brother I needed that
[2:19:36] contract because I have no job he says
[2:19:40] what do I do
[2:19:42] now he says I am out of
[2:19:45] work but it was such a wonderful
[2:19:48] job this man went to the
[2:19:52] he had a contract that he wanted to to
[2:19:55] perform but he was told by another man
[2:19:59] don't take that contract but he came to
[2:20:02] Mal he says I am out of
[2:20:05] work so if I lose that contract it means
[2:20:08] I'm in trouble the prophet says I went
[2:20:11] out to
[2:20:13] pray and when I went to pray the angel
[2:20:16] of the Lord came and said go tell him
[2:20:21] say the Lord go
[2:20:23] on there because the
[2:20:26] men is
[2:20:28] wrong who told you not to take that
[2:20:30] contract the man is
[2:20:32] wrong and he
[2:20:34] said also speak to him this to tell his
[2:20:39] wife not Not To
[2:20:42] Doubt about having that
[2:20:45] baby the prophet had prophesied over
[2:20:48] this the man's wife years before to say
[2:20:52] you're going to have a child she was
[2:20:54] about 43 or so years old and she was
[2:20:57] told you're going to have a
[2:20:59] child and and many years passed about 8
[2:21:02] years before many years passed and the
[2:21:06] brother was also out of a job it was a
[2:21:09] parness in his wife and a
[2:21:12] parness in the finances but the prophet
[2:21:16] spoke to the wife you shall have a child
[2:21:18] eight years later tell the man go and do
[2:21:22] that work and tell your wife not
[2:21:26] doubt that
[2:21:28] prophecy and the man went to have a job

[2:21:38] give you a
[2:21:39] child if your husband is out of a job I
[2:21:44] give him a contract on the basis of the

[2:46:37] that are here with us
[2:46:40] today just get
[2:46:44] ready these young people are going to be
[2:46:46] one of the great financiers of the
[2:46:50] [Music]
[2:46:57] project Elijah said it and it
[2:47:01] [Music]
[2:47:03] happened
[2:47:06] amen and I remember you know talking
[2:47:09] about speaking the
[2:47:13] word a sister when Pastor was giving a
[2:47:16] testimony of a sister who was following
[2:47:18] him
[2:47:21] in Ethiopia this was there was a very
[2:47:23] faithful
[2:47:25] sister and I know she might actually be
[2:47:29] streaming she did not have a job for a
[2:47:31] long
[2:47:33] time the Pentecostal ministers by the
[2:47:35] time we found her they had cheated all
[2:47:37] our
[2:47:41] money and she was
[2:47:44] bankrupt she didn't have anything but
[2:47:46] she she loved God
[2:47:49] so one day she came to my office
[2:47:52] crying said pastor this message is
[2:47:55] true surely God want me to live like
[2:47:59] this I am tired of this I want something
[2:48:03] to
[2:48:04] happen What can I do and in that
[2:48:07] atmosphere I do not know what to tell
[2:48:10] her do you just speak words of
[2:48:12] encouragement what do you
[2:48:14] do do you speak presumptuously
[2:48:18] is going to do something no
[2:48:20] you because it was a real moment for
[2:48:25] her and so I desire to know the mind of
[2:48:30] God and the Holy Spirit led me to that
[2:48:33] scripture can these Dry Bones live
[2:48:37] again son of speak can
[2:48:41] again and you know as as I was sharing
[2:48:43] that scripture with
[2:48:44] her faith rose up and when Faith rose up
[2:48:48] in the place where
[2:48:50] we I told her now let us pray she had
[2:48:53] stopped by this time crying
[2:48:56] and believing that God is going
[2:48:58] to and as we were praying right
[2:49:03] there Inspire to speak to her I said
[2:49:07] sister you are going to get a job it's
[2:49:10] going to be a big job in a good
[2:49:17] company and as as soon as I say those
[2:49:20] words I told her I do not know how long
[2:49:22] it will
[2:49:24] take but I know it is going to happen
[2:49:27] because it was spoken
[2:49:29] under of course as a man I doubted
[2:49:33] also like was that
[2:49:37] God but we've been
[2:49:43] told so don't
[2:49:45] doubt it took two weeks
[2:49:48] two weeks you know
[2:49:51] what a job came
[2:49:53] up um from America and they needed uh
[2:49:57] the head of a financial um it is like
[2:50:01] Western
[2:50:06] Union and uh there was no one qualified
[2:50:10] because you see they wanted someone who
[2:50:13] um has a financial background at least a
[2:50:17] degree also speak good
[2:50:20] English and so they tried to okay they
[2:50:23] brought it through other people in the
[2:50:25] church I did not know of it they even
[2:50:29] sent some
[2:50:30] CVS and those people were turned
[2:50:33] down I learned that they couldn't
[2:50:36] Express themselves well in
[2:50:39] English they turned them down and then
[2:50:42] the sister was still you know
[2:50:46] believing but as soon as I heard of that
[2:50:49] I told the brother who was handling
[2:50:50] this I said brother I can almost tell
[2:50:54] you right now that job I mentioned the
[2:50:58] name of
[2:51:00] the he said but the sister
[2:51:03] not she didn't have a degree she didn't
[2:51:06] have a
[2:51:07] diploma I think also she didn't have a
[2:51:12] certificate but she had been in
[2:51:15] Dubai and interacted with you know
[2:51:18] different people and out of that she had
[2:51:20] learned to speak
[2:51:22] English and she had quite a good spoken
[2:51:26] English and so that's all she
[2:51:30] had and then so the brother said okay
[2:51:34] I'll try and send her
[2:51:36] CV so they sent her CV and when they the
[2:51:40] first
[2:51:41] call they met to
[2:51:44] her they told her oh you are good
[2:51:49] welcome to the
[2:51:51] team the first
[2:51:53] [Music]
[2:51:54] interview and in the second
[2:51:57] interview so she the after the first
[2:51:59] interview she came back to be very
[2:52:03] excited God is doing it I said change
[2:52:06] change God has done it she said amen and
[2:52:11] you know Ethiopian people don't say Amen
[2:52:18] [Music]
[2:52:19] and
[2:52:21] so um you know after the second
[2:52:24] interview on the second
[2:52:27] interview this
[2:52:29] question how much do you want
[2:52:34] to the biggest amount she could think of
[2:52:37] in that
[2:52:39] moment she said
[2:52:42] it that I want to ear I think it was
[2:52:44] 10,000 b or something
[2:52:47] like about at that time maybe about
[2:52:49] three something million
[2:52:52] shs for someone who has no college
[2:52:58] degree and you know what they
[2:53:02] said no
[2:53:04] negotiation whatever she wanted to
[2:53:07] ear
[2:53:08] done and she got that job and supported
[2:53:14] financially the work
