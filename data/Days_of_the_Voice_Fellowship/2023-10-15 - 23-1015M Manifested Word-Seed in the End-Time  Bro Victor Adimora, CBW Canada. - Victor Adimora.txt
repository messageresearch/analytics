a [Music] moment God bless you it's a such a blessing to be [Music] here we flew from Canada um we flew in on Friday it was a long flight but it was worth it I'm I was actually born in Nigeria Nigeria I was born in yes yes in Nigeria I was born in in Nigeria so when I came to Uganda I felt like I was home again amen amen my father moved us to Vancouver Canada in in 2002 so I've lived there for the past 20 years I was sharing with brother bus that my dialect is kind of mixed kind of mixed and so sometimes S I have the Canadian accent mixed with a heavy tongue from Nigeria and my wife's also from South Carolina so in the United States and so sometimes I have a mixed dialect so I'll try and speak as clearly as possible so you can understand amen I bring greetings from Cloverdale Bible Way in Vancouver BC Vancouver BC from our pastor Tom Ray Pastor Ed bisc and the ministry over there amen [Applause] amen amen um so I'll share a little bit of my testimony before we go into the word so I'm 27 years old God got a hold of my heart God got a hold of my heart when I was 17 it was a supernatural experience when I was 15 16 I was in the world I was just in high school or board in school and I was partying and drinking and smoking but one day Jesus came by my way amen he came by my way in my bedroom I began to cry out to God and say Lord why does it have to be this way I didn't hear a response but I started to see a change a desire began growing in my heart which begin to push out the desires of the world and it begin to change me from the inside out the drinking went the smoking went the running around went the swearing went and I've never been the same ever since that's the transforming power of the word when Jesus comes into a life and changes them from the inside out they can never be the same power of God Amen let's stand to our feet amen amen amen amen let's turn our Bibles to First John chapter 3 First John 3 verse 1 and this morning by the grace of God we want to minister on manifested word seed uh manifested or expressed amen manifested word seed in the end time we know according to scripture we are in the final age there's not another age coming the final age which means Rapture where now this Mortal will be changed immortality where now it's the manifestation of the sons and the daughters of God and that's why God's calling out of denominations God's calling out of organization calling all Methodist Baptist uh Pentecostal and calling them into the Bride of Jesus Christ calling out of the world come into Christ to fulfill the mind of God in this last AG as a prophet would say from the back part of the mind of God God had a purpose and his purpose was to have the preeminence in the people to express his attributes and that's what we're here to do our purpose goes beyond working our purpose goes beyond making money our purpose goes beyond eating our purpose goes beyond even coming to church it goes into the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God where now you begin to bring forth the very promised word of God for today amen let's read first John chapter 3 first okay [Music] am and I'll read here behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not verse two belov beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure you may have your seats the prophet of God would say here in the message God rich in Mercy he said God is the word and it was made flesh and dwelt amongst us that he might bring forth the other attributes of God the body of Jesus was the very body of God Moses seen him pass the back part of him no man had seen his face but now we see him we have beheld him see him as the sacrifice he was an attribute of God displayed the word and when any believer comes to God he become God's attribute of his word he is used to manifest that Word of Promise for this day so when God's called you whether you're born in the message whether you come into the message God's called you to manifest his attributes all that God was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he's poured into you and I he's poured every attribute he's poured his power he's poured his anointing he's poured Faith he's poured love into you that you might manifest who he is the Unseen God is here amongst us he's here manifesting through your flesh we not looking for a corporate body to come we're not looking for the second coming of brother Bram but we're looking for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God we're looking for the expression of Jesus Christ again today as he was in his corporate body he said um he said more Works than these will you do it's not that we're going to do more Works than ourselves so that we're going to do Greater Works but that more Works shall we do because it's a many membered body and so God's purpose is to bring Sons and Daughters of God to maturity to manifest his life to the [Applause] world and to find the last elected seat of God that we can go on a Rapture and remember the Rapture is a body of Believers so I'm dependent on you we're dependent on one another we're family I'm from Canada you're from Uganda but we're both from heaven and we're going back to where we come from so the same God that purposed in you has purposed in me and when that last elected seed comes to the revelation of who they are the Rapture will take place amen the denominations of tus Rapture is an event yes it is an event but this message this Prophet this word has taught us that it's a body of Believers which is a born again experience which is the revelation of Jesus Christ in you amen so what is the proof of a manifested seed the elect of God will hear his voice amen we cash the elect of God will hear his voice amen the Bible says here in John chapter 10 my sheep hear my voice and I know [Music] them of the message of the hour so it's more than coming to church it's more than just listening to tap but now it goes into understanding what the prophet is saying it goes into a divine revelation of what this Prophet taught my sheep hear my voice the Sheep of God hear the word expressed the Sheep of God hear the word expressed so they it goes beyond the sound of the message it goes beyond a feeling it goes beyond emotion it goes beyond coming to the altar it goes beyond reading your Bible and praying every day but it goes now to where those things bring forth a life brings forth the life of Jesus Christ where it's not I that lives anymore but it's Christ that lives your friends ask what happened to you your wife asked what happened to you your children ask what happened to you said I met God I've never been the same I've been changed from the inside out Chang and my nature change my emotions aren't the same my desires aren't the same the things I used to do I do them no more because I've Been Changed by the renewing of my mind because it's God's transforming power of the SE seed of God has been there before the foundation of the world put inside of you a desire and so you come through the muck and the mud like that little Li the Lily comes through the mud and it fights its way through the Li and it fights through the mud and then it expresses its beauty and that's who how you and I are amen the prophet said that we bypassed our theophany to come into the world to be tempted amen that we might be tried to express the gold of God which is a Christlike character try do the fiery furnace of affli God allowed us to bypass that we might Express him as a Healer that he can express himself as a savior he can express himself as a deliverer he can express himself as a Transformer what is it is God expressing his attribute that's the purpose of God my sheep hear my voice amen the Sheep of God are the only ones that have the ability to understand the word when it's expressed oh my the Sheep of God are the only ones with the ability to understand the mind of God this last day so we are the most privileged people on the face of the entire world it don't matter what your bank account say it don't matter what house you live in it doesn't matter what clothes you wear it's about the seed and in that seed has power to Break Forth of its own kind that seed word of God lays in the presence of the Sun be ripened and the reain of God the spirit of God begins to fall upon the sea week goes by sorry a day goes by a month goes by a year goes by something starts to happen you begin to be changed you find out you didn't understand that a week ago but now you understand something you read a year ago but all of a sudden you grasp the Revelation something he read five years ago now you understand because the seed of God in your life as you come to church as you listen to the message as you feed upon the word as you stay in the presence of the sh glory to manifest the life of Jesus Christ you begin to bring forth the very life of God is not in heaven it's in you amen am because we are the attributes of God we were in the mind of God before world and he's allowed us to come into the Earth to be expressed Amen to show forth his glory amen give God a hand clap of Praise amen amen listen now so my sheep are the only ones with the ability to understand his voice and as a result they manifest that word which has been expressed to them so the bride of Christ is the only one that has the ability to hear and manifest to hear and manifest other seed can only hear but you can hear and manifest you can hear and live you can hear and manifest Christ amen amen hallelujah hallelujah brother Ram goes on to say here those Apostles of that of that day who was ordained to life he know it said all the father that given me come to me only thing you have to do is just make the voice known they know it for my sheep know my voice and brother says the voice is the word expressed the voice of God is the word expressed they believe it they don't have to scientifically Pro it or ask any sadu or Pharisee or anything else for my sheep hear my voice and this is the voice of God in letter form this is almighty God in letter form this word is God's promised word in letter form is God expressed in letter form so they'll try and tell you what about the Quran Quran Quran they'll try and tell you what about the Quran the say what about the other books but this Bible is God's life expressed in letter for and the Bible says the letter kills but the spirit of the Living God brings this word to life brings this word that's letter form again walking on the earth talking on the earth living on the earth what is it it's the word expressed again amen so what's the next thing to do when you've come into this body you begin to express God's glory so number one my sheep hear my voice and my sheep manifest my voice and the voice is the word express number two they express his [Applause] glory they express his presence they express the Shak Glory they express his his wealth they express his attribute they express his glory amen the word Glory means Splendor it means wealth it means honor it means also weight so God you are his glory and that means he's actually put you on on the scale with him even you're not down here but you and God through the sacrifice of Calvary been made equal once again through the blood of Jesus Christ you are sinless you are spotless and the prophet said sin has once been confessed your sin has been confessed he said it drops in the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ and it goes back on the accuser sat Hallelujah so your sinless you're spotless you stand holy in the presence of God Amen you're free to worship free to dance free to run free to run hallelujah amen because you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you've been called for this hour You' been called to manifest his life from the youngest to the oldest you are the expression of God today Hallelujah am hallelujah amen amen the Bible says here in Zechariah 2:5 I'll turn the Bible said that God said I will be a wall of fire around you I'll be a wall of fire around you and the Bible says he will be the glory in the midst of her Christ is the glory in the midst of his bride Christ is the Splendor Christ is our wealth Christ is our honor Christ is our weight Christ is our riches Christ is our joy Christ is our everything and Christ in you see the revelation of the whole thing Hallelujah Christ in you makes you the revelation of the entire Bible this glorious bride I I I I wish I could express it the way it's in my mind right now this bride of Jesus Christ Satan over the ages Satan over the ages has tried to stop this bride he's thrown denominations he's thrown Creeds and dark he's thrown Temptations he's thrown economic struggle he's thrown Warfare he's thrown uh politics and and and governments to try and stop the bride but you can't stop this because this pride is the word expressed and the Bible says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but the word of God will never pass away and this is the word which has formed you amen glory be to God Amen the Bible says here in s of Solomon Chapter 2 it says oh my Dove Thou Art in the Clift of the Rock in the secret places of the stairs let me see thy countenance let me hear thy voice for sweet is thy voice and thy countenance is comely take us the foxes take us the foxes the little foxes that spoil the Vines for our Vines have tender grapes my beloved is mine and I am his he Feth among the lies until the day break and the Shadows flee away turn my beloved and be thou like a r or a young heart upon the mountains of bether so if you look at that scripture hears Song of Solomon wri the Bible brother Brown say that the Song of Solomon is speaking of [Applause] Christ and here it is the she the bride she's saying oh come down my beloved let me look upon your face let me see your countenance your face is beautiful your face is lovely like a like a like the wife speaking to the husband or the husband speaking to the wife and he's saying take us my beloved I am yours and you are mine and brother B would say it's Christ speaking to his bride you're saying I am yours Lord and you and I I am yours and you are mine because now now you begin to express his glory now you begin to express his appearance the Bible says that husband and wife they become one flesh and Christ and the bride become one when you become the word when you hear the word you become the word and you and the word become one you begin to walk the word you begin to talk the word begin to think the word and any other thought that's against the word you kick it out any thought that's against this word it out when Satan comes against you like a he will raise up the standard and he raises up the standard in you he raises up the word oh my Hallelujah glory be to God what you say it's dark out there it's evil out there there's so many Temptations there's so many devices amen but uh but the prophet said I'm trying to remember it said that that I can't remember but with every every my voice but with every thank you with every age God will rais the standard so whenever Satan comes like a flood when Satan devices starts to seem to get greater God will send a word blast the power of the enemy he will send the word to drive his people back he will the word to bring healing he will send the word to bring Revelation he will send the word to express his power he will send the word to break the power of the enemy he will send the word to Quicken the young people he will send the word to Quicken the young L he will send the word to place the bride in their position place them in Heavenly places in Christ he will send the word because he will feed his sheep Church of God the Sheep will never go hungry God's sheep will never go hungry God's bride will always be f for seven Church ages Satan has tried to cause famine he tried to starve the God said I will restore all the years the canum and the and the locus has eaten I will restore back and in this day in this age God has restored back all the word Church Hallelujah God didn't bring back a portion God didn't bring back a little bit God didn't bring back a little Crown he brought back the fullness he brought back the full brought back all that he was all that he was in the back part of before he was God he was Elohim the self-existence and the self-existent one is expressing himself showing forth who he is if you can crash this message is the very thoughts of God not thoughts of a man not thoughts of a man it's not thoughts of an organization come from God has come to capture you to grab the bride grab this one grab that one and say come on we're going to heaven amen come and follow me Jesus said my sheep know my voice anyone anyone that's not willing to leave father or mother Jesus said is not worthy of the Gospel if you don't leave father mother job

R would say God will be indebted to no man God will not be de in debt to any man amen God is not going to owe any man whatever you've done for God he's going to pour back seven you poured out for God you will pour back in what you say I had to leave my family say I had to leave my job you say I had to leave my friends amen church God will restore all that you've sacrificed all that you've given God is going to restore it back he restore back your home he will restore back your marriage there will store back your wife there will store back your husband there will store back the church WIll store back everything amen hallelujah and that's why Paul would say that this gospel is the power of Jesus Christ amen it's the very power of God this gospel not a gospel of another day but this gospel this message is the power of God this message is the very power of God to overcome the devil this is the very power of God heal cancer this message is the very power of God set the captive free this message is the very power of God to turn the life around this message is the very power of God to deliver young men from pornography this message is the very power of God to deliver young ladies from from any fashion of the world this message is the very power of God change your desire the music of the world the Holy Ghost filled music this message is the power of God turn you around you are running towards the world you're trying to find an opportunity to go to the world waited for the doors to open but this message when it comes into your life it's the very power of God transform this message hallelujah hallelujah amen I mean hallelujah hallelujah amen before the foundation of the world God predestinated a bride amen he predestinated a prde for whom he did for no he also did predestin to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren amen moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justifi whom me Justified then he also glorified amen God for ordained a plan that would Express his for all that God was church all that God was the creator of the heavens and the Earth all that he was before he was God brother would say that before God was God he was eloh the self-existent one amen amen because God is an object of worship brother would say that he created angels to Angels begin to worship and then he became God Amen but before that El amen so before God was gone amen out of him come the logos the Loos was the light the word that went out from God the word that went out at the beginning that went out amen which was the first begotten of the father Jesus Christ amen the logos went out from God the and it came down and took on flesh amen manifesting the fullness and the glory of God so I want you to follow me follow me stay with me for a few more minutes I won't be too long but I want you to understand that almighty God the Bible says God is a spirit so that Spirit God When sin came into the garden when there was a fall in the garden when the serpent beguiled Eve God had a plan for Redemption and that plan for Redemption God cannot die as a spirit the spirit cannot die and so God had to come in the flesh to die to be kolk kinsman redeemer with man he couldn't die as an angel because an angel is in kin with man let me put it this way you understand Angelic seed can't bring forth human seed right so if you understand what I'm saying so a there there's no there's no seed of angels but Angelic seed can't bring forth human seed human seed can only bring forth human SE and angels are angels okay so God had to come into the flesh you had to become a human in order to bring back back to God again amen so when we saw Christ when we saw the fullness of God in flesh we saw God Amen for Jesus was the very expression of God was the very Heart Of God Jesus was the very love of God Jesus was the very power of God all that God was he poured into Christ so when Christ was upon the Earth the Bible says he was he was he was right he was comly that nobody his cess wasn't nice he wasn't good to look upon he wasn't Rich he wasn't wealthy he didn't have a place to lay his head but he walked amongst us the creator of heavens and earth walking in flesh to do what the Bible says Jesus came to seek and save those who were lost now not all will be saved John chapter 3 says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now listen that whosoever believes so sometimes people take that scripture and say oh how can you sa the whole world so be saved but the Bible says is whosoever believes shall be saved so that's the key you must believe the word amen this message you must believe the word only believe all things are possible only believe this word will take you amen I want amen he is the Shak [Applause] Glory he is the logos that went out from God God therefore Christ who is our life he cannot be a denomination amen catch this very closely so when you go out to work or to school or wherever you go and someone says to you what's wrong with denominations what's wrong with organizations what's wrong with creeds because Christ is not a denomination Christ is not an organization the word is eternal so if it come from Heaven it's got to go back to heaven and you come from heaven and you're going back to heaven but denominations are Earthbound amen dominations increase are Earthbound they're Earthbound it doesn't have the power to take you in a Rapture doesn't have the substance to change your body amen what you say what you say how is that so because the Bible remember the fullness of the word has to be expressed in this day all that God is has to be expressed today and so if you take a part of God and you leave the rest it becomes the denomination if you take a part of God and you leave the rest it becomes an organization and it stop moving on with God so that's why it's important so we must eat all the message eat all the words if it hurts you say out if you bless it you say Amen take the word into your mortal body into your spirit and into your soul and it will bring this body into subjection to the word amen hallelujah hallelujah remember it's the word that makes the difference amen Moses goes on and says here he said I beseech thee Show Me Your Glory he said I will make all my goodness pass over thee amen I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious I will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou can't see my face for no man has seen my face and this church listen to the scripture here and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock amen there's a place by Jesus Christ there's a place for you in the world that places upon it's upon the rock of Revelation Amen Let the storms blow let men say what they want to say but this word is the revelation of God and when you stand on the word there's not enough gates of hell that can prevail amen hallelujah amen God's glory was veiled in the pillar of fire he was veiled when he came down and spoke to Moses bur a bush he failed when he went from before the uh Israelites went behind them and stood between them and the Egyptians God was veiled in the pillar of fire the Bible said that God looked from the pillar he looked out from the pillar fire that pillar fire veiled God Amen God was veiled in his Prophet God was veiled in Moses God was veiled in Elijah God was veiled in William BR God was veiled but he was veiled expressing himself to the believer only the believer had the ability to see beyond flesh only the believer had the ability to look Beyond Humanity see only the believer oh my church I'm coming to something here his glory was veiled in Jesus Christ the Bible says here Jesus saith unto them I am the way the truth and the life amen no man cometh to me except sorry no man cometh unto the father but by me oh my if he had known me you should have known my father and from hence forth oh my Hallelujah forth you know him and have seen him so when they saw Christ they saw God Amen when when uh when philli said show us the father he said show us the father suff us Jesus said have I been so long with you you haven't seen me oh my Saints do you see what God's been doing down Through the Ages he's been expressing himself he's been hiding behind a mask hallelujah amen he's been hiding behind a Mas he's been hiding behind a veil he just heard his voice you didn't see his face but in this last day Tak off the veil and show himself and showed his power show who he is Amen in this last day he's ripped the veil and so in Jesus Christ same yesterday today and forever amen showing forth his glory amen Church That Glory now is not in a corporal body called Jesus Christ That Glory is not in the pillar of fire that glory is not in William Bram he's gone off the scene but that glory is now in the Bri hallelujah hallelujah amen That Glory is now in you glory is now in you that Glory now in you hallelujah praise the Lord give God a handup of Praise amen That Glory is in you Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the Bible says here amen I love this B said accept you become one of these little children you shall in no wi see the kingdom of you shall in no wi see Ken you shall in no wise understand the Kingdom of Heaven except you become like one because they have a heart to receive the word they have a heart no matter if they don't understand they have a heart to receive if their mommy says something if their daddy says something they love them so much they love their parents so much they love their mother they love their father that no matter how they feel they believe what they're saying and the Bible says accept you become except you humble yourself as one of these Little Children You shall know why see the kingdom and God has putting you a heart not a Heart of Stone but a heart of Flesh to be molded to be shaped into his image that you can receive the word for your this Glory his Splendor his honor his wealth all that God is according to this bride Hallelujah all that God is poured to you and I amen that's why Satan fights you so hard that's why he attacks your mind he attacks your body he attacks this attacks that bombards you at your job you on the road because he's trying to fight the seene but in that seene power to break the power of Satan amen hallelujah the Bible says the Lord is our shield and our exceeding great reward will you say brother Victor a promise was given to Abraham do you realize where Abraham SE every promise that was given to abah your spiritual every land that was given to Abraham every possession that was given is your spiritually so rise up and amen don't let Satan squat on your land don't let him sit on your land it's time that you break forth take a hold of your possession amen amen we say brother Victor I'm single I need a wife I need a husband the Bible says that blessed is the man amen who has a wife amen blessed is the man Quivers full the prophet said that a wife is the best next best thing outside of Salvation where are the young men that are going to rise up and take their god-given possession Hallelujah that was free don't blame the sisters it's the brothers that have to make the move the sisters are waiting they're waiting on men to rise up in this generation and be men hallelujah amen amen it's come too long we have so many weak men so many men without backbones that don't know how to stand they don't know how to believe the word know how to pray they don't know how to pull they don't know how to believe right amen so if you don't how to do those things how are you going to take care of a family how you going to believe for God to provide but I want you to understand something amen it's part of your god-given inheritance amen the sisters of waiting but listen it's not by emotion it's not by feeling it's by prayer amen the prophet said Pags on your knees you ought to pray because the Bible says the twain shall become one flesh so your marriage was made in heaven but it takes work on Earth so you've got to pray you've got to fight you got to seek God's face for who your soulmate was amen because it's a type of Christ in the bride it's a type of Christ in the bride the marriage on the earth Paul said a reflection of Heaven that's why the prophet would say it's the next best thing outside so the same burden you have when God got a hold of your life that's the same burden need to have for a wife that's free I leave [Applause] amen amen remember the whole Bible is a love story it's a love letter to his wife amen this whole entire scripture is God's love letter to God's love letter to me amen and that's why he's come down and showing himself in the Shak Glory the sh Glory was that light was that light that hung between the CH the wings of the Cherub over the ark over the Ark of the Covenant and the prophet would say that when that sh Glory begin to shine God's presence was there the Shak Glory the personal and Vindicated presence of Jesus Christ the Bible says here in 2 Chronicles chapter 7 now when Solomon had made made an end of praying the fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices and the glory of the Lord build the house and the priest could not enter into the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord had filled the house and when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came down and the glory of the Lord upon the house amen they bowed themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement and worshiped and praised the Lord for he is good and his Mercy end forever see when this kind of Glory came when they saw God's Vindicated presence when they felt his presence they began to worship they began to praise and it came from prayer when Solomon had made an end of praying God's presence came down the people began to worship amen Church when the word comes your way and the presence of God Falls begins to bring a worship bring a praise bring a glory out of the Church of the Living God Amen so when you become Born Again number one is you hear his voice number two is you express his glory and number three you begin to express his power church here we go you begin to become expressions of the power of God when you walk out and Satan comes by your way say Satan in the name of Jesus chist I bind you for the Bible has said what s of things you bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven you walk with Authority because you are an expression of his power amen you begin to speak and God honors pray lay hands on the sick and they shall recover because you are you expressing the power of the Living God Amen the Bible says here Isaiah 9 the people that walked in darkness have seen great light they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death upon them ha the light shine what's the light the light is when this word is made manifest was saying who there's a man here could turn the light brings life he said light is life and so when that light comes into you it is the very life of God the very life of Jesus Christ amen the prophet will go on and say here and until you come from behind the badger skin so the badger skin or or you can just say flesh that hung in front of the the the Tabernacle it was animal flesh but now brother I'm saying here they've got to go beyond the bad skin to come into the holiest of holies if you stay out from the batter skin all you see is flesh but you've got to go past the B to see the very Mind Of God got to go past the bad to touch the H of his you got to go past the B to lay hold of God's promise because you begin to express his power his church is himself revealed amen and expressed by the word itself that he is God Amen God's church is himself revealed and expressed that he is God Amen Matthew chapter 28 says here and Jesus came and spoke unto them oh my church hallu all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth amen so of all power is given unto Jesus all that God was he pour into Christ all that Christ was he pour into the church so of all power was given to Christ where's the power now the power is in the church the power is in the bride the power the Bible says to walk and be bitten by Serpent and it won't harm you power of the supernatural the power to pray drive out the enemy the power of lay hands on the sick and they recover amen the power to to preach the gospel and lives are turned around amen amen amen just coming down to a close here the Revelation is the power of God loosed to you so this Revelation is God's power loosed to you Amen brother goes on says here oh my church he knows Satan knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible if they get the true revelation of the two Spirits working within the framework of the CHR and by God's spirit discern and withstand discern and uh and and oppose the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless he he will be as thwarted today is when Christ with stood his effort power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with true Revelation in our [Applause] lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail but we but we will prevail over the church it's not we will we have take it's now we're going to Prevail we are now Overcomers Jesus Christ it's not we're going to overcome now we are the sons of God manifested power of God overc every devil now we are the sons of God now we are the daughters of God now we're overcoming amen hallelujah hallelujah just a few more minutes just a few more minutes hallelujah amen hallelujah Church Hallelujah this is Rich amen amen so I'm going to skip one here but you become expressed image of his Vindicated headship so when you're born again when you've come into the body you begin to EXP Express his headship amen his headship so let me explain what headship is so brother R says here when the head unites with the body The Head and the body become one and this message has United the head with the body the purpose of this message is to unite the head with the body and that's why brother Bram said he said my message is to show the people that Jesus Christ is here he's not a far off he's right and church if you can see with eyes of Faith you will see the living savior here so the head shall which is the word is united with the body which is the word so the word meets the word and the prophet said when the word meets the word takes place amen the power of God is on display when the word meets the word the Earthly bride United with the Heavenly GR so now you begin to express his head begin to express his mind you begin to express the word hallelujah hallelujah let me lay something in here quickly here amen the prophet of God said here I read a scripture first just beareth me for a little bit here for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man and I'm sure we all understand why Paul's saying this but Paul is basically saying pulling back from to Genesis he saying that the man was in the original Creation The Very image of God but the woman came out of the man Eve came out of the side of so that's what that's what Paul's saying here that's why he's saying the woman is the glory of the man the man is the image of the glory of God man should not cover his head but the woman should have her hair covered for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the man so I'm getting into something here for this cause ought the woman to have power over on her head because of the Angels nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man NE nevertheless neither is The Man Without The Woman neither the woman without the man in the Lord for as the woman is of the man even so is the man also by the woman but all things are of God Amen judge in yourselves is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered not nature itself teach you that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him but if woman have long hair it is a glory to her for her hair is her covering so their sisters who have hair down to their heels and their sisters who have hair down to their ears but the prophet said don't cut it because when you cut your hair you are showing you're out of headship when you cut your hair sisters you are showing you're not under headship and when the brothers have long hair they're showing they're not under headship and that's what Paul is saying here he's saying that the woman should have her hair long and the man should cut his hair amen so brother would say now that long hair was a Nazarite vow it was showing that you're separated it was showing that you're consecrated unto God it was showing that you've given your life to Christ and that's what happens that the sister or the woman or the wife under the headship of the word and the man in his position the sister is in her position the man is is not without the woman and the woman is not without the man so it's not saying that that the man should push aside the woman and it's not saying that the woman should push aside the I don't know how it is here but in America the woman like to run the man and in other cases you have the men pushing down the women but in the mind of God that's not what God father in the mind of God that's not what he envisioned he envisioned that the twain shall be one the husband and the wife the man and the woman in their god-given positions in their god-given place sering God so they've come under headship of the word amen I'll just close with this here I've been long sorry I'll close with this so when you come into this body you begin to pulsate a life from another kingom so when I say Paul that means you have a heartbeat that means you're alive and when you begin to pulsate this life from another kingdom it shows that you're not of this world but you're from another world and the life inside of you is pulsating a life from another kingdom where Jesus Christ is King and that kingdom is the word and I'll close with this here that Kingdom the Bible says the Kingdom of Heaven is within you and that kingdom is the word of God spirit and life in your own life stand to our feet Hallelujah Lord amen amen amen how many come you with a need how many have a need doesn't matter what it is Jesus Christ is pres his word has been preached now it's your turn now it's your turn to receive the blessing amen
