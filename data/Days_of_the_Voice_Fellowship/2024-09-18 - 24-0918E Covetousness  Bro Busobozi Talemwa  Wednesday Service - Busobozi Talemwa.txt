tonight who are here that have made it to the church and those that are streaming whoever else may Lord be a part of this service gr it Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen I'd like to uh greet everyone today in the name of our cryst thank you musicians today we are just um going also to speak to evening light briac so that means I'll be doing one hour um I would like to have us go to the book of Hebrews chapter 13 vers 5 to six we are reading in the name of Jesus Christ let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as ye have for he has said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me so is that verse six yes he says so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me no you can just interpret it directly bro okay so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper I will not fear what man shall do unto me amen amen you may be seated so this evening I want to speak to you on a very important subject I'm requesting after the service you kindly send this link to all those members who are not here request them to listen to this service and and um because I feel that this will change many things in our lives um I'm going to speak to you on an unusual subject I don't usually give such subjects just one word cous praise the Lord cous and pray for my interpreters so that we may be in the same spirit amen uh if I find it is is getting hard time I will tell him to sit and then I just preach with that in an interpreter so this evening I am just speaking on covetousness cous tell your neighbor cous we have a lot of problems in life and um we have a lot of Mur that happens every day for example in our country we've suffered what we call corruption and um you know people who are not faithful and we have things we suffer theft many homes have gats brother sh it was perfect in the beginning and then he made it worse so uh you know know uh we have many people who have Gs and um you know they the reason why people have Gs is because they're fearing thieves we at my home we did not we had we had a a perimeter wall fence but we did not have the bued wires on top and then someone and then some thieves broke in and vandalized our car so you see we we had to find someone to put those B and you know people put electricity on top so that when someone tries to go over it electricity just shock them students at school they have their boxes where they keep their things and they put a padlock on it because of theft someone else will come and steal it money when you have money you never want to count it before everyone because of many reasons maybe someone may want to steal it from you maybe someone will desire to come and you know borrow some from you and maybe someone may just come and tell you to give them some so no one among all of you among all of us counts money in the open you always count it secretly because you fear what someone else will do with your money and you know we we have many people that um uh go into um you know uh things like fornication and and things like adultery we have people who you know have en envy and and um things like last greed now these things that I just spoke about and many many others I asked one young man today a question which I think is very important which we should ask ourselves the question is why do people steal so well he said people steal because they don't have but I said no I don't believe that why why would someone steal because they don't have you know because to begin with maybe I don't have but have not gone out to steal maybe you don't have you've not gone out to steal but why does someone else who doesn't have like you feels they should Ste it is someone who doesn't have like you you see because for them you know they they have something else disturbing them it is not because of lack we don't steal because of lack but people still because of one thing and that is called cous cous now cous is a spirit that has killed many Believers while they are in the church many of them are dead spiritually dead yet they are believers you see this Spirit seeks to undermine it seeks to undermine the Providence of of Jehovah God you know it has you know it has you know it is responsible for broken homes the spirit of covetousness is responsible for for the lives of younger people that are not serving God you know their life is broken up in pieces they're not serving God because of the spirit of cous you know covetousness has separated Brotherhood you find that someone doesn't feel good about the other it is not for any reason is because of the spirit of cous now cous does not operate alone it has many cousins and many brothers and and those are the ones which I have already mentioned lastor Bor people that we know the Bible calls them extortioners you know cormen MERS how can someone just kill you find someone you know we've seen it here in someone on a and someone else comes and hits them and takes away what they have she doesn't even know what is inside but you see he feels what the other person has should be there it is a bad bad Spirit you even find actually it is a it is prevalent among Believers it is so much sin prevalent you know you find that you know sometimes even you know it comes to things as simple as what somebody else owns you know someone can literally H you because of the good thing you have not because you know you did anything but simp because you have something they don't have and then they will get envy and then they will become jealous but jealous is not the problem the problem is cious you know jealous just simply came because of cous you know someone you know you you have maybe a good suit dress some people would even go an extra mile of saying please can you borrow it to me so I can use it one time you know such people they will even take it and they will never want to give it back again to you you see Brethren you should say Amen on this thing because it is many people suffering because I seen it with my Naked Eyes believe suffering because someone come says borrow me your cloth and they will never return it to you because they being tormented with the spirit of they never desire to borrow it their desire was not to borrow but to have it and so he says please can I use your shoes and then he will take it just for one service another service another service and he always see him at church God bless you bless you he never talks about the shoes and until the shoes even you know become old and he does and he doesn't mention about and you say any he's a brother he a sister it's all right I'll not talk about it's a spirit of cous you know it is because people are not contented with what they have they feel what someone else has even houses you find someone who is living in a good house living in a neighborhood that has very poor houses and all those people will hurt him because they would say that man is proud that man is bad simply because he owns a good house not because he did anything bad to people are cous what the person has because someone is driving a car and you you are walking and then when they pass you and other times when you are in a car you won't see people walking and then when you pass a brother can you imagine that brother is so proud he just passed me like that he couldn't even wave to me but they just that's not the issue deep in their heart they know you might don't have SE them but because they cious they feel it shouldn't be you driving it should be them driving that you see you know when some when you receive something others f it should be their they will even change their prayers they will go before God you have given the other one the other what about me and the Bible says you pray and you don't receive things you pray for because you pray a Miss God can't answer such a prayer because it is coming out of a heart of cous a cous heart you feel you don't even have Vision you don't know where your life is going but you you keep comparing your life with others you are not contented with what God has given you and what God has made you but you feel what God has made others should be you when someone marri sister phbe where when someone marri sister phib you feel no no no no no no oh we have a phib in the church sister Sandra or whoever it is you know you find oh no that sister should have been mine I could feel it in my heart even we were matching even the way I was you see it is cous it is nothing else it is cous this is what makes people in the world be others this is what makes others actually when people are traveling you know many times they don't tell others they're traveling especially here in Africa when someone is flying they don't tell others do you know why because of cous they fear what the other person will do to them some people are very good at going around and trying to frustrate people's lives the moment they hear that something is happening in someone's life they begin getting a headache how can I frustrate it how can I stop it how can I make make it not happen you know why do they do that it is because of cous I'm telling you covetousness in English means a strong wish to have something especially something that belongs to someone else to have something a strong wish to have something to have something especially that thing which belongs to someone else is not yours it is somebody else's but you feel you wish strongly it was yours that whenever I put on this suit you feel a strong wish to have it as yours some of you would even go an extra mile coming to ask that person how much do you buy this suit how much do you buy and then the person will tell you I bought it 500,000 you say I wish the Lord gives me that money oh my brother this is a very good but what are you looking for you want the person to say can I give it to you it is a spirit of conciousness by the way it's a very dangerous Spirit it has broken homes it has broken relationships even churches and Ministries today I want us to learn about it and first of all I want us to go into the book of Kings excuse me those of you with luganda Bibles I'm going to request you to read slowly with me because is very many verses and to save time we will just read in English and follow in your luganda Bible First Kings chapter 21: 1 and brother you can just follow as well in Yanda Bible so that you can be in the same Spirit afterwards to know how to interpret some words okay look at verse one we will begin from verse one and it came to pass after these things that nabo the Israelite had a vineard which was in jezrael had by the Palace of Ahab king of Samaria and haab spake unto nabo saying give me your vineard that I may have it for a garden of hubs because it is near unto my house and I will give thee for it a better Vineyard than it or if it seem Good To Thee I will give Thee the worth of it in money and nabo said to Ahab the Lord forbid it me that I should give the inheritance of my fathers unto thee and Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of the word which nabo the jite had spoken to him for he had said I will not give Thee the inheritance of my fathers and he laid him down upon his bed and turned away his face and would not eat bread I want you to hear these things this is a man a king think about it a king a man who had the whole Kingdom a man who people PID taxes to a man who almost had everything he desired to have who ate what he needed who had a big house who had huge lands who had a lot of money but there was another poor man and this man had a a field a which was closed to this man's house so King Ahab came and told him please he sat you know down with him in peace it doesn't matter whether you want to take that thing in peace if it is not yours you are not contented that's the reason why you are looking or eyeing something which doesn't belong to you God loves you and whatever he wants to give you he will give you God made only you you you world there is no one like whatever is yours is yours no else can can take your place if each of us can understand that we are going to grow Spirit to know that no man can take my place I am special I am wonderfully made powerfully in the hands of God whatever I need father knows what I need he is able to provide and what he has done for others he can do for me amen it's a revelation it's an understanding so it is wrong for you to think cous is only with poor people oh it's because they don't have that's why they cous here is an example for you man who was rich I mean we're talking about a king but here this King had a lot of wealth but when he saw a certain beautiful piece of land that a poor man had inherited from his father you know he felt even this should be mine I should Annex it to my land and he oh my God he began seeing a vision amen with something which is not his when you see someone's money you begin to see what it will buy you if I can only get what that one has I I can do this and this and that if I can only get that c I can use it for this and that if I can have those shoes if I can have that suit or that the way I will serve god with it you are seeing a vision with someone else's blessings and that is wrong you should see a vision with the blessing God promised you in the word hallelujah whatever is mine is mine and I see a vision of my life with what God has blessed me with if people saw this people had a revelation of this we would have few Beggars have few thieves people can't see it and here you see NAB he knew this is mine this is my inheritance from my fathers and when this King came to him he said now I have a proposition please give me this land you know I am rich I will give you even another land I even give you money whatever it is you want simply give me your small land here so I can make it mine but in his mind he was seeing vegetables there vegetables and the way he was envisioning it it look so nice near his house he knew his bless he knew his Blessing he said I will not give it [Applause] away brother sister you must fight for your inher whatever God has given you don't allow any come and Rob it from you they come and Rob away your virtues they they come and Rob away your innocence the Devil comes and robs away all the things you know comes and robs away what God has given you by his word amen amen you know women the Devil comes and tries to rob away from them Womanhood girls theil wants to R away their virt their virt boys want to Rob away their manhood and their desire to work their desire their ability to work to provide for their home and the devil wants to rob it away and give you something easy in in place of but you see knew what to He said Come Rain Come Sunshine no one will take this from me this is my inheritance and theous man he was he felt so down he became so sick and this man Ahab went in his bed and he turned away his face and he will not even eat how many times have you gone to fasting and prayer because you want something else that belongs to somebody else may God have mercy let me continue reading verse 5 but Jezebel his wife came to him and said unto him why is your spirit so sad that thou eatest not bread and he said unto her because I spake unto na of the Israelite and said unto him give me thy vineard for money or else if it pleases Thee I will give thee another Vineyard for it and he answered I will not give thee my Vineyard and Jezebel his wife said unto him D thou now govern the Kingdom of Israel arise and eat bread and let thine heart be Mary I will give Thee the vineard of nabo theelite so she wrote letters in H's name and sealed them with with his seal and sent the letters unto the elders and to the Nobles that were in his City dwelling with nabo praise the name of the Lord amen hallelujah amen friends I want you to follow me closely here you see this man you know was a king he couldn't get this land he wanted to get it peacefully but he failed he wanted to get it in the right way right but he failed and therefore what did he decide to do his wife met him said why are you like this come on be happy I will give you this and how many times have we seen such shortcuts let me tell you to begin with it was not the will of God for this man to have this and so he was already fighting against God secondly he has now gone to a shortcut to acquire what he wants there is no shortcut with God and your blessing if it is oh Hallelujah if it is a blessing from God it will never have any shortcut the blessing of God is a blessing of God the Bible says the blessing of God make a few rich and God adds no sorrow the blessings he gives here is a woman saying I will give you don't worry I will give you what you want I give you what no man no woman can give you what you want if you want joy no one if you want happiness no if you want peace no wonder only God will give it to you whatever you desire in your life let it be money let it be houses Let It Be buildings rather listen businesses or a wife or woman a man or whatever it is or children no one can give it to you only God Only God Only God can give us the blessings of today I'm sharing a very important principle hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord amen as I was studying these things today from the beginning to the end my heart was just bubbling in from beginning to the end and as I was writing these things you know I I believe God wants to you know speak to someone today with these words so listen and we continue with this reading and so she wrote the letter saying proclaim a fast and set NAB on high among the people and set two men sons of Bia before him to Bear witness against him saying thou did blashe God and the king and then carry him out and stone him that he may die and the men of his City even the elders and the Nobles who were the the inhabitants in his city did as Jezebel had sent unto them and as it was written in the letters which he had sent unto them they proclaimed a fast and set nabo on high among the people and there came in two men children of beral beral and and sat before him and the men of Bia witnessed saying NAB both did blashe God and the King Then They Carried him forth out of the city and stoned him with the stones that he died then they sent to Jezebel saying nabo is stoned and is dead and it came to pass when Jezebel heard that nabo was stoned and was dead that Jezebel said to Ahab arise take possession of thy Vineyard of the vineyard of nabo the jite which he refused to give thee for money for nabo is not alive but dead and it came to pass when Ahab heard that naboth was dead that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineard of nabo the jite to take possession of it now you see friends You' heard the story now when they killed him he thought he can now possess let me now tell you s whatever is yours that God purposed for you the devil cannot take it no one don't even compete I see people with doing competition people compete everywhere they compete in business they comp at place of work in Ministry in preaching Ministry in music Ministry in church people compete no need for competition just to know who you are what God has made you is you and you are the only one that God made like that you don't need to conver what somebody else is hallelujah amen and so here is a man his wife Jezebel and by the way that also warns us why we should Mar Believers if you marry an unbeliever you will increase your ungodliness [Applause] amen yes but if you marry a Believer amen a woman that fears go will always bring amen this man to the understanding of the word check your Bible properly you will see that it has always women who have been subm minded it was the wife of Pontius pilot I think it was who came and told him I saw in the night that this man is innocent don't kill him God spoke through that woman it has always been women who are so minded you know it was the wife of of the mother of the of the Mano who came down and said to him the angel came and spoke to I met him you know and yet this man had not even seen the angel are you following me it was it was this same woman who trained Samson about the word of God about the vision for his ministry and his it was Elizabeth that even had a vision for the name of John it was Mary amen who God used in this world to bring forth a life that redeemed this entire world it has always been woman women women women that God uses in a family that is why it is not a man that breaks a family it is a woman who breaks a family and that is why it is not a woman that breaks H builds a family not a man that build did you know that chur it is the woman that builds the the Bible says the foolish one with own hands but the wise one with so you see a woman is a very important thing in every important home you see in the beginning it was a woman you know that brought deception and and and she said oh God has given me a child that's why they said it's women who give children not men why because the woman knows what happened in the garden she knows when the seed was planted know what kind of seed is planted because she knows she Waters the seed properly and in America today in America today you have the Democrats who will say that it's okay for woman to pull out a child it is it is her decision what she does with her but as the woman of America that but that's the woman of America but there is another woman amen there is a woman of God there is a woman of virtue a woman of the word who only obeys the word of God she is the backbone of Family Church Society even say you if you want to know how that church is look at the women in the church how they dress how they behave how they speak that is how spiritual that church is how they make their hair you see you will know if you want to know the man don't look at him look at his wife know that man is spiritual so we can now know was a very kind man because he had a woman that brought more Mischief the man was was mischievous but the woman was more mischievous the woman is always a comforter but she Comforts your nature there's a deep reation there I hope you Hallelujah am you see here you know Jezebel was only there she my my husband that's what they have done to you oh don't worry I will give you that l just be happy Rejoice they will see that I am Jezebel in this and then she wrote letters kill that man M why cious mothers come out Envy has come out all things are come why cious and the word of the Lord hallelujah am friends I will tell you what I love about this word that children of God are never alone if you're a child of God you can Oh Glory you can never be left alone if you humble will always fight for you God will always speak for you God will always fight your Hallelujah you don't have to fight with anyone you have to stress and get headache the only thing you need to do brother is to submit yourself to the word of God and let God fight your battles and na was killed it doesn't matter whether he was killed God was still on his side and God is always on the side of believers who hold fast the word of faith Hallelujah it doesn't matter what the devil will do to you will always be on your side if you are a believer on his side and the word of the Lord came to Elijah saying arise go down to meet King go and meet him saying is in Samaria behold he is in the vineard of where was according toab was dead and the vineard was but according to God was alive and this was still his inheritance hallelujah amen whe is gone down to possess it and he has gone to possess the the vineyard and thou sht speak unto him saying th sayth the Lord th killed and has th taken possession and thou shall speak unto him saying say the Lord oh my god did you say God started tell him you have killed you have taken possession no one can kill what belongs to you no one can kill your future no one can kill your life no one can take possession what belongs to you if you know who you are amen and so you have killed you have taken possession okay tell him that say the Lord he said in the place where dogs leak the blood of Na shall dogs leak th blood even your blood and I have said to Elijah hast thou Found Me Oh My Enemy and he answered I have found the God will always find you your enemies somebody help me say hallelujah will always find your en amen and he answered I have found thee because thou has sold thyself to work evil in the sight of the Lord behold I bring evil upon you and I will take away thy posterity and I will cut off from Ahab him that pieth against the wall and him that is shut up and left in Israel meaning he'll cut everything off of him and I will make thine house like the house of jeroboam the son of and like the house of bash the son of aij for the provocation where thou has provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin and of Jezebel also the Lord [Music] saying dog shall eat Jezebel by the war him that dieth of in the city of the dogs the city the dog shall also

and you happy because of it you walking in the coun of the ungodly I became bitter and because ofous envied vineard because ofous because ofous can make you do anything rather let it be far from you the Bible in the book of 2 Timothy 3:1 it says this know also that in the last days per time shall come for men shall be lovers of their own and then says blasphemers disobedient to parents and thankful and holy this is prophesied to come in our time people will be people are so listen to what says in the message Investments That is the picture that we see today that many of us people see God moving in these last days we see the Holy Spirit coming Among Us and viting the Very Promises of the Bible that will take place and yet with our denominational differences and our Creed and our social [Applause] standing as that young man heard down the opportunity like he did there's something I wanted to say here they were afraid to make the investment they were afraid they fear to make the investment to make the investment he would rather hold onto to the things that he had popular money cous instead of putting his investment you know to invest is like when you you start a business to invest money or invest something into it the opportunity knocked at his door but turn down and I want to say also to the people are afraid of making the invest people don't want to invest people fear to begin things they would rather take they would rather C what other people have made popularity money listen they would rather hold hold on to shifting Sons rather than the real investment of trusting God for their lives did you know brother you can trust God with your life to take you from point A to point B you can trust God with your life God has Oh Glory he has never failed anyone no if you read this Bible cannot read and say this one trusted God and God failed him there is no one who has ever trusted [Applause] God and I am willing to invest my life in Christ I want to invest my life there I don't want to hold on to the shifting sign of man's Wisdom come we do this we get big money oh we go do loty we do this young people want a quick return but they are not willing to work for it they want money you know this man came to Jesus he wanted eternal life was not willing to do the investment they want money but they are not willing to build a business from scratch they are not willing to settle on a job they're not willing to work listen to me you young people if you don't want to work the spirit of cous will overtake you have to be willing to work to soil your hands and your feet to labor all great people have not started great they started simple but you look at what the great house and You Begin counting yourself as if you're one of them yet you not willing to do what it takes to be good you give them some small job they want a fortune out of it that's why we have corruption and EMAs they want children but they are not willing to settle down in marriage they want get family but they are not willing to get married they want good life but they are not willing to to for it oh I want chips and Chicken all the time but I want someone else to buy it for me rather sell their body so that somebody can give them chips and chicken cous you are conting those things but you are not willing to toil they want joy but they are not willing to sacrifice everything else for it did you know we have many Believers of Christians who are looking for the Holy Spirit but they are not willing to seek it they're not waiting to seek him when you tell them go pray first they can even hardly pray for one hour they can hardly do that they will do is to you know when the presence of God comes in the church to have a few tears and after that it's over brother let me tell you you have to learn to go into the presence Yourself by yourself begins with having a hunger and having a thirst doesn't just come by osmosis you have to be willing to seek for him but where you just come halfhazard there is nothing comes easy you see people who are celebrating 50 years in marriage don't you think it was a Bed of Roses it wasn't years of struggle and toiling PA understanding forgiveness love suffering but you see people would not go for those that is difficult for them they want is a life you see they think everything will come on a silver platter they touch other people's cars and they begin to claim them as and they call that faith that is liness cars do not come by you touching someone else's and say I claim it Lord no that is not faith that is lack of faith and if you have faith you will go and have a vision to start a business from nothing say Lord I believe you will take what I have and you will magnify you multiply you can build with what I have you can make it large lar is God able to do it beable don't desire to receive free things someone says I'm going to give you a car God does that sometimes but that's not the way God has promised to give God has promised to bless the work of our hands go and work if you can't find a job start a business if you have no Capital go and sweep the roads and accumulate Capital even 10,000 is capital you can build from that 10,000 you make 50 50 you make 100 you make 1 million As Long as You Follow the financial princip of the Bible he promised to bless the work of your hands they see people's daughters and and they want to have them they want to have them without marriage you see they see people's wives and they desire them for themselves they see beautiful churches and they want to be a part of oh that's a big church I want to go there you want to go there it is a sign that you are cacious if you want a beautiful Church believe that God can use you to make that big beautiful church I remember when we first started you know everything this trying this and that you see it's not easy to start it is not easy to start anything even the great started humble the Bible said who has despised the small so you see always when you see somebody despising you tell them I'm bigger than you see what you see is not Hallelujah is not what I am what I am you are yet to see that is how my good Lord that's how God makes greatness he doesn't make Greatness by conting big things build you struggle you go through the process you go through the system Hallelujah some people even fear to marry oh marriage is not good so so I don't care how many people they are not me you ought to say Amen they are not me if they they fail and I believe because they fa I would fail that means I have cous I'm comparing myself on their basis I am comparing myself the promises of God because God can never fail hallelujah amen hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord glory amen come on give him a clap of Praise [Applause] hallelujah amen I'll just continue on here for maybe 30 more minutes or so I and then I uh uh for the for the zoom we will'll be able to give them the other second part as well later on Amen so we see here that uh in the book of 2 Samuel if you can turn there 2 Samuel chter 11 ver 2 and it came to pass in un evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof of the from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said is not this BBA the daughter of Aram the wife of UA the hittite and David sent Messengers and took her and she came in unto him and they lay with her for she was purified from her uncleanness and she returned unto her house now I want to see friends what cous can do is a sickness if you're not careful it doesn't matter who you are you can actually have cous and you don't know and you think no it's all right you see David was a king he was a man after God his own hand and David was on top of the roof of his house you know she didn't close her curtain sister always close your curtain dress properly stay away from being a problem you are the one presenting yourself that way so she presented that way and when the man saw her he converted her she was not his wife she was the wife of another but this maned her he desired her and he told the boys go get her and the Bible says she lay with her he lay with her and afterward she was pried and then she was sent back to her house and a woman conceived and sent and told David and said I am with child and David sent to Jo saying me I want you to see cious will bring many sins cious adultery and now other sins are going to come and so David said to Ura go down to the house and wash your feet and U departed out of the King's house and there followed him a mess of meat from the King and so and then they also sent a mess of meat let me just read in English but Ur slept at the door of the King's house with all the Servants of his Lord and went not down to his house and when they had told David saying UA went not down unto his house David said unto UA CEST thou not from thy Journey why then did this not go down unto thy house and Ura said unto David the ark and Israel and Judah abide in tents and my Lord joab and the Servants of my Lord are encamped in the Open Fields shall I then go into my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife as thou livest and as thy soul leaveth I will not do this thing and David said unto Ura T here today also and tomorrow I will let thee depart so Ura in Jerusalem that day and and the tomorrow and when David had called him he did eat and drink before him and he made him drank and at evening he went out to lie on his bed with the Servants of his Lord but went not down to his own house and it came to pass in the morning that David wrote a letter to joab and sent it by the hand of Ura and he wrote it in the letter saying set you rear in the Forefront of the hottest battle and retire you from him leave him there that he may be smen and die and it came to pass when joab observed the city that he assigned Ura unto a place where he knew that Valiant men were and the men of the city went out and fought with joab and they F some of the people of the Servants of David and the he died also now friends I want I know most of you know the story already David you know he was committed adul with bash 's wife tried to cover up the story by bribing U now Braes has come he wanted to cover up the sin forever if you're a child of God you can never cover up a sin forever made him be content with things such as ye have first Timothy 6 says perverse disputings men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness these men they think that gain is godliness from such withdraw yourself from such men who think Gaines godliness what did he say withdraw yourself tell your neighbor withdraw yourself but godliness with content man is great gain hallelujah amen can everybody say these words what is mine is mine you believe it brother Marin shout it what is mine is mine what is meant to be mine will mine what is not mine is not mine what is never mine will never be mine how many understand that amen glory to God Amen contentment with godliness is great riches and I just want to read you a few things here before I conclude listen tasting for Life brother bam says now notice he says the perverted life the devil inspiring it do you know it's the devil who inspires perverted life that life becomes miserable I've oh my good Lord he says I've never seen it in all stages from the rich to the get into the spirit of this and listen to this he says I've had the privilege of being in King's palaces from that to the lowest on the SK Ro and I've never seen a contented sinner in my life from the richest to the poorest our Prophet says I've never seen a contented sinner in my [Applause] life that's right there is no happiness or contentment outside of Jesus Christ I've seen them so rich till they have bodys with them and I've also seen them so poor Till They begged for a drink of whiskey and from the one to the other he say say there is no satisfaction I want everyone here or anyone here who has ever saw sinned and said I sinned and I became satisfi but he says then what do they call that life how could you call it life when you want to take it when you want to take yourself it's not life and in the influence of another he says it takes the power of the resurrection of Christ among the people amongst the people that they see that Christ is not a statue hanging in a building but is's a living being in the form of the Holy Spirit living in men and women Glory bringing peace bringing contentment and bringing happiness hallelujah amen Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost is the power in us that brings us peace that brings us satisfaction that brings us am and contentment it brings us happiness that's why we sing song like I've been happy since the Lord brought me out you know if you want to see someone who is delivered if you want to see someone filled with the Holy Ghost someone who is always happy always happy in the bedroom happen at home on the road in the church Happ when someone is s it is clear they don't have the Holy Ghost you can never have the Holy Ghost and be sad but if you have the Holy Ghost even if you have no money even if you have no CR even if you no cars even if you have no house even if you have no church you will be happy the Holy Ghost brings happiness that's why we sing songs Jo is mine Jo is mine can you look at me with happiness now Jo today that's why when a preacher preaches by the of the holy ghost He will always be happy have you wondered why because the Holy Ghost put an effect of of drunkenness you can never see a drunken s if you are drun all of them are happy the moment they begin drinking drinking several bottles when they were s then happen will begin what is happening with him he's drunk he dry they know them those ones who are not drunk will be sober and there and this one will not care whether it's falling on people or not just he's happy because he drunk don't I'm drunk right now when you take a seep of the Holy Ghost it just makes you happy that's why Pentecost they asked them a question why are you drunk at this early hour and Peter defended them he said let me tell you they are not drunk with wine drun with the Holy Ghost when you drink the Holy Ghost you become peaceful you become happy you become contented in your life if you have your one Shir you will wear that one to church the first week the second week the third week and people will be wondering this one never changes clothes but he's always happy what is wrong with him he's always happy and always clean but having one the Holy Spirit does that but someone who does not have the Holy Spirit will do two things one they will be dirty he may have 20 shirts but he will always be dirty he can't was any of them the spirit of darkness is on them and then when they come to church they will be so sad even on top of what they have they will always want to borrow what others have but brother that Shir is good can I use it can I use it next service can I use it can I use it can I use it no contentment but godliness with contentment is a great gain I remember we used to have me and Brother Martin and the others those days we we didn't even we couldn't afford a suit so if you see me wearing a good suit leave me alone you don't know where we from we came from there the Holy Ghost gave us this good one we used for us we used to we used to be given by the by a miracle someone gives you a c and you cannot even go and reduce it because you have no money to reduce [Applause] it we have those pictures if if you want you can come and we were proud and happy you say a small man and the coat was wearing and you are there SM Bible now when I see those pictures like oh God the Holy Spirit really made the fo out of us but that was good that was good because we we we didn't have a brain of our own is not long ago our friends at that time they were stying having and shorts you know those shops how do they call flipping up you don't know those Styles we we used also to wear them before and then you know you put on that and then you put on something and then you know here you do like we used to have those things but when we came to Christ we changed our life we changed our Channel we changed our desires and appetites and we were contented with what God gave us and with those few things we served God faithfully and you would just wear that Shir that Shir that Shir and that tie that sh and that but always clean and because you were was you was washing it many times you can clearly see it was getting breathed by ironing and but we loved God and we were happy God lifts you and takes you from Glory Glory but theous Spirit want you to have the greatness in a minute many young people these days they want to go to Forex Trading Forex Trading is it a sin
