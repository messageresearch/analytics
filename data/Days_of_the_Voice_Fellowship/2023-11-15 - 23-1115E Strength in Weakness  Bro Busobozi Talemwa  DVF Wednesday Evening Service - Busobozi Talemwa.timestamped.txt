[32:53] tonight so why don't we turn to our
[32:56] Bibles
[33:00] in the book of First
[33:07] Peter chapter
[33:11] 3 we are beginning to read from verses
[33:18] one and we shall read up to verse
[33:25] S
[33:29] likewise ye wives be in subjection to
[33:32] your own husbands that if any obey not
[33:36] the word they also May without the word
[33:41] be worn by the conversation of the
[33:51] [Music]
[33:55] wives
[34:00] while they behold your chest
[34:02] conversation coupled with
[34:07] fear who adoring let it not be the
[34:11] outward adorning of plating the hair and
[34:14] of wearing of gold or putting on of
[34:22] [Music]
[34:25] apparel
[34:29] but let it be the hidden man of the
[34:32] heart in that which is not corruptible
[34:35] even the ornament of a Meek and a quiet
[34:39] Spirit which is in the sight of God of
[34:42] great
[34:50] [Music]
[34:55] price for after this manner in the old
[34:59] time the holy women also who trusted in
[35:02] God adorned themselves being in
[35:05] subjection unto their own
[35:17] husbands for even as
[35:21] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him Lord
[35:26] whose short as ye are as long as ye do
[35:29] well and are not afraid with any
[35:34] amazement likewise ye
[35:37] husbands dwell with them according to
[35:40] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[35:43] unto the weaker vessel and as being
[35:46] hairs together of the grace of life that
[35:49] your prayers be not
[35:55] hindered
[36:24] amen you may be seated
[36:27] [Music]
[36:28] you can greet your neighbor and tell
[36:29] them God bless you welcome to the house
[36:31] of
[36:33] God
[36:38] Amen is the Lord
[36:41] good good to
[36:44] you so this evening I'm speaking on
[36:48] strength in
[36:53] weakness strength in
[36:55] weakness
[36:58] so we notice
[37:00] here Peter starts writing these
[37:05] things and is mainly speaking about the
[37:09] character of a
[37:13] woman um being saying that let their
[37:20] adorning not be the outward
[37:24] daing but we see that weing living in a
[37:27] generation or a
[37:30] time where the woman's strength is in is
[37:35] in her outside
[37:40] appearance I'm happy to see you sister
[37:41] Esther we prayed for you so that that
[37:45] her strength is on the
[37:47] outside uh
[37:52] looks the a typical woman in our
[37:55] generation would not dare go outside
[37:57] without without putting on
[38:03] makeup because her strength to her is in
[38:06] her
[38:10] makeup but you see the Bible speaks of a
[38:13] woman of character
[38:16] here and it says that her ading should
[38:19] not be the outward
[38:22] [Music]
[38:24] daing you see of plating the
[38:27] hair of wearing of
[38:30] gold of putting on of
[38:33] apparel and we know he is not saying
[38:36] that these are
[38:40] wrong is is not saying that if a woman
[38:43] plated her hair it's
[38:47] wrong or if a husband gave her necklace
[38:50] it's
[38:51] [Music]
[38:54] wrong oh that if she dressed good
[38:56] clothes it is
[38:59] wrong we know that that's what Paul is
[39:01] that's not what Paul is
[39:04] saying but Paul is saying that her Adon
[39:07] should go beyond
[39:10] [Music]
[39:13] this it should not be the outside things
[39:17] that everybody
[39:19] [Music]
[39:20] sees it should be the hidden man of the
[39:25] heart
[39:28] and I know that we are living in a time
[39:30] where
[39:32] ornaments women love
[39:37] ornaments you know you find them using
[39:39] ornaments all over well I've not never
[39:41] seen a Believer who uses earrings at
[39:45] least because we all know that earring
[39:48] is a sign or symbol of
[39:53] slav that's what in the Old Testament
[39:56] that's what they War when um they they
[39:59] were going to be a slave
[40:00] [Music]
[40:05] forever when the the trumpet of Jubilee
[40:10] sounded and they
[40:12] refused to be set
[40:15] free then they would be given a uh what
[40:18] you would call a an hearing they would
[40:21] be put on the door post and then they
[40:23] would hit their their ear with a hole
[40:25] and then put that ring
[40:29] [Music]
[40:33] there like you see a cow when it is
[40:38] tagged and the women today are tagged
[40:41] all over wherever you are
[40:45] going it's a sign that the devil has
[40:47] hold them
[40:50] hostage and that's why Believers don't
[40:52] go for
[40:54] those and so we find that the Bible says
[40:57] the ornament of a of a
[41:01] Believer should be the ornament of a me
[41:04] and acquired
[41:08] Spirit you will not you see the women
[41:10] are always after the things that of high
[41:15] value oh you know the boys out there or
[41:18] the men that marry them are really
[41:24] strained because they have to keep up
[41:26] with the with the with a with with the
[41:31] value to buy an expensive
[41:34] earring an expensive
[41:37] necklace an expensive nose
[41:42] Jewel and unexpensive fake
[41:47] eyelashes and and things and then makeup
[41:50] and all those
[41:51] things but you see the Bible says for
[41:54] this woman
[41:57] The Virtuous
[41:58] Woman her ornament will be of a Meek and
[42:01] AC quiet
[42:05] spirit that is why as much as Believers
[42:08] we know your husband can give you a
[42:15] necklace we really know that believers
[42:17] who are really Holy Ghost
[42:21] filled women that really seek after
[42:25] God time for for those
[42:28] things you know their time is really to
[42:31] seek after Holiness to seek after
[42:33] pleasing
[42:36] God their time their time is spent in in
[42:41] prayer in making their
[42:43] home in teaching their
[42:46] children praying for their
[42:48] husbands you see this is uh what a a
[42:52] virtuous woman
[42:55] does and you know the Bible continues on
[42:58] here to
[43:00] say after this manner in this way the
[43:03] all time in the old time the the holy
[43:06] women also who trusted in God they did
[43:08] like
[43:13] this this is how they adored
[43:16] themselves being in subjection unto
[43:19] their own
[43:21] husbands even as Sarah obeyed
[43:25] Abraham
[43:26] calling him
[43:28] Lord praise the name of the Lord I I'm
[43:31] just so thankful for this message of the
[43:34] hour that this message has liberated the
[43:39] men by setting free the
[43:43] women I'm so thankful that I can walk to
[43:46] a shop
[43:49] somewhere maybe to a jewelry
[43:52] shop Desiring to buy a ring for my wife
[43:58] and I'm so thankful for this
[44:00] message that our eyes will not be all
[44:02] over every jewelry
[44:06] in oh buy me this oh buy me that oh buy
[44:10] me this by the time they walks out she
[44:12] has several kilograms on her
[44:17] body you will find that even if the
[44:19] woman is
[44:21] rich as long as she has Christ in her
[44:25] heart those things will not take our
[44:29] heart and the Bible says the old women
[44:32] did the same
[44:34] way they Adorn themselves that
[44:38] way being in subjection to their own
[44:42] husbands now even as Sarah obeyed
[44:47] Abraham calling him Lord now now we
[44:51] realize that in a
[44:53] marriage is not part ship the way we we
[44:57] think it
[45:03] is we are
[45:06] Partners that's not really the teaching
[45:08] of the
[45:10] Bible in
[45:12] marriage the man is the
[45:15] Lord and the woman is supposed to sub to
[45:18] submit to her
[45:21] Lord that's why sister you should not
[45:23] get married or you should not get
[45:25] married to a man you cannot submit
[45:29] to what is the kind of woman that you
[45:32] are going to
[45:33] marry the what kind of woman I'm talking
[45:36] to the woman what kind of man are you
[45:38] going to
[45:40] marry you're going to marry the kind of
[45:42] man that has the Lord Jesus as his
[45:48] headship if Jesus is is his
[45:51] head then he's not going to you are not
[45:54] going to submit to the devil
[45:57] but if Jesus is not the headship of the
[46:00] man you will never submit to
[46:04] Christ and that's why you should marry
[46:06] Believers all the
[46:09] time never marry an
[46:11] unbeliever because when that
[46:14] happens it breaks the entire
[46:19] chain I'm trying to build something here
[46:23] now if you can follow me so even as
[46:26] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him
[46:30] Lord whose daughters ye
[46:34] are amen sisters you are the daughters
[46:38] of
[46:40] Sarah as long as you do
[46:43] well and are not afraid with any
[46:47] amazement likewise ye
[46:51] husbands dwell with them according to
[46:54] knowledge
[46:57] giving hon unto the
[47:00] wife as unto the weaker
[47:04] vessel everybody say we
[47:10] Vel weaker
[47:14] vessel weaker
[47:16] vessel oh the brothers love that
[47:20] part whenever we say sister is a weaker
[47:24] vessel think that she means it means
[47:27] that she's weak and she's good for
[47:30] nothing but today I want us to look at
[47:34] that I want us to see strength in this
[47:40] weakness amen and especially Brothers
[47:42] pay a lot of
[47:45] attention and sisters listen
[47:50] carefully the Bible says if a woman is
[47:54] in subjection to her
[47:59] husband if your husband does not believe
[48:02] the
[48:04] word that him without the
[48:09] word but because of your
[48:12] character because of your obedience and
[48:14] submission to the
[48:17] word it will win him to
[48:23] Jesus now in marriage
[48:26] the Woman's Place is
[48:31] submission the Woman's Place is
[48:35] submission the man's
[48:37] place is love and cherishing of the
[48:42] wife the woman must submit herself to
[48:44] her
[48:47] husband and the man must love his
[48:52] wife now if one of them lives their
[48:58] the whole marriage will be
[49:01] broken because if the woman do not
[49:05] submit the man will
[49:08] not and if the man
[49:11] does the woman will not
[49:13] submit so you see each of you have to
[49:16] stay in your
[49:19] place if you say your wife doesn't obey
[49:23] you your wife my wife doesn't submit to
[49:27] me there is a problem with you to begin
[49:31] with if you say oh my husband doesn't
[49:34] love me
[49:35] enough that means there's a problem to
[49:37] begin with
[49:39] you the the problem is right there
[49:41] because you see this is
[49:45] intertwined if you think the Lord Jesus
[49:47] does not love
[49:49] you there is a problem with your
[49:52] faith there is a problem with your
[49:54] submission
[49:57] but if you submit to every word of
[49:59] God he will love you with all the
[50:03] love amen and he loves you even
[50:08] unconditionally but if you submit to him
[50:11] you obey his word you do according to
[50:14] his
[50:16] ways you will always see his
[50:21] love and then on down we go I'd like us
[50:24] to see the symbol of
[50:28] submission praise
[50:32] God maybe if you want to help me with
[50:35] that uh 1 Corinthians
[50:43] [Music]
[50:48] 11:3 there is a foundation I'm trying to
[50:50] build so you can see something
[50:54] here listen but I would have you know
[50:57] that the head of every man is Christ and
[50:59] the head of the woman is the man and the
[51:02] head of Christ is
[51:12] God every man praying or prophesying
[51:16] having his head covered Dison his
[51:24] head
[51:28] but every woman that prays or prophesies
[51:31] with her head uncovered dishonors her
[51:41] head for that is even all one as if she
[51:45] were
[51:48] sheven for if the woman be not covered
[51:51] let her also be shown but if it be
[51:53] ashame for a woman to be shown or seven
[51:55] let her
[52:08] covered did we all understand that part
[52:12] please listen carefully here he says if
[52:14] the he says every that the head of every
[52:18] man is
[52:21] Christ and the head of the woman is the
[52:24] man
[52:25] [Music]
[52:26] so now and the head of Christ is
[52:29] God so in other words the head of the
[52:33] man is
[52:35] Christ the head of the
[52:39] woman is the man if you're following me
[52:42] say
[52:43] Amen every man praying or prophesying
[52:46] having his head covered this horn as his
[52:54] head understood that
[52:58] part no one a few of you if a man
[53:04] praise or
[53:06] prophesies having his head
[53:09] covered this hor as his
[53:13] head who is the head of the
[53:17] man Christ so if the man
[53:20] prays or
[53:22] prophesies meaning if a man worships God
[53:26] with his head
[53:27] covered with the physical head
[53:30] covered he's dishonoring
[53:33] Christ that's why we don't put
[53:38] hearts in church when we are praying men
[53:42] we remove our
[53:45] hearts that's why we also do not uh grow
[53:50] our hair
[53:54] long you will see it
[53:56] soon verse 5 but every woman that prays
[54:00] or prophesies with her head and covered
[54:02] dishonors
[54:08] her Len every woman that prays or
[54:15] prophesies her head her physical head
[54:19] covered she dis
[54:24] who
[54:26] if a woman
[54:28] prays or
[54:31] prophesies with her head
[54:35] uncovered meaning she has not covered
[54:37] her
[54:38] head she dishonors her
[54:42] head who is her
[54:45] head her
[54:47] husband so that means if a man if a
[54:51] woman prays or
[54:54] prophesies
[54:56] with her head
[54:58] uncovered she dishonors her
[55:02] husband are we all there
[55:05] now and then he continues on if she
[55:08] doesn't cover her
[55:10] head it is the same as if she should
[55:14] shave off
[55:23] everything if she doesn't come her
[55:26] head she should remove all the
[55:32] hair but then he says but if it is a
[55:36] shame for a woman to shave
[55:40] everything then she should cover her
[55:45] head so the question is what kind of
[55:47] covering is he talking
[55:51] about read verse 13 here now
[55:55] judge in
[55:56] yourselves is it comonly that a woman
[55:59] pray unto God un
[56:06] covered does not even nature itself
[56:09] teach you that if a man have long hair
[56:12] it is a shame unto
[56:19] him praise God my sound today I don't
[56:23] understand it very well so listen he
[56:25] says judging
[56:27] yourself is it cly that a woman pray
[56:29] unto God
[56:36] uncovered is it good is it right for a
[56:40] woman to pray unto God
[56:43] uncovered does not nature itself teach
[56:45] you that if a man has long hair it is a
[56:47] shame unto
[56:53] him if a woman have long
[56:59] hair it is a glory to
[57:03] her for her
[57:06] hair is given
[57:09] her for a
[57:12] cover praise God so what does this
[57:17] imply the Bible has told
[57:20] us the woman if the woman prays with her
[57:24] head uncovered
[57:27] she's dishonoring her
[57:30] husband and then down here on verse 15
[57:33] years told us her hair is her
[57:39] [Music]
[57:41] cover and then up there he had already
[57:44] said if she is
[57:48] uncovered let her shave
[57:52] everything what does that mean it means
[57:55] if the woman cuts her
[57:59] hair or if she trims her
[58:03] hair then it is better for her to wipe
[58:05] out
[58:09] everything but because it is a
[58:12] shame for a woman to to be
[58:18] baldheaded let her not cut her
[58:23] hair because her hair is given her for
[58:29] coverage in other words if a woman cuts
[58:31] her
[58:33] hair she dishonors her
[58:38] husband hair is a sign of
[58:43] submission hair is hair is a symbol of
[58:47] submission hair is a symbol of
[58:51] Glory Hair is a symbol of power
[58:55] somewhere there he said that you see she
[58:57] she has power on her
[59:01] head do you remember
[59:03] Samson the power was in his
[59:08] hair the woman has
[59:11] power on our head because of our hair
[59:16] can you imagine that why because hair is
[59:21] a sign of is a symbol of
[59:23] submission
[59:25] and I want to show you here there is
[59:28] power in
[59:30] submission as long as the woman stays in
[59:33] her
[59:35] place there is a power that she
[59:39] wields you know she is the glory to her
[59:43] husband what is the place of a woman in
[59:47] marriage submission what is the place of
[59:50] a
[59:51] man love and if the the woman stays in
[59:55] her
[59:57] place she has a lot of
[1:00:00] power let me tell you sister you can
[1:00:04] actually control your husband if you
[1:00:06] submit to
[1:00:09] him control
[1:00:12] him you have the power to control
[1:00:15] him if it's your god-given
[1:00:18] husband you don't need witchcraft to
[1:00:20] control
[1:00:21] you you have the power with you
[1:00:25] to a sword of
[1:00:28] power but you just need to realize
[1:00:31] it praise God praise God something I
[1:00:36] want you to see
[1:00:37] today now remember as we are speaking
[1:00:41] everything this is the type of the
[1:00:45] church let us first read John John
[1:00:53] 156
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] I hope you understood that Foundation
[1:00:58] because the foundation everything talk
[1:01:03] about if a man abide not in me he is
[1:01:06] cast forth as a branch and is withered
[1:01:08] and Men gather them and cast them into
[1:01:11] the fire and they AB
[1:01:20] bur if ye abide in me and my words abide
[1:01:24] in you ye shall ask what you will and it
[1:01:27] shall be done unto
[1:01:36] you amen hallelujah amen here is the
[1:01:40] spiritual application of what I just
[1:01:44] said if the bride is in her right place
[1:01:48] of
[1:01:49] [Applause]
[1:01:51] submission submission to every spoken
[1:01:54] word
[1:01:56] she has the
[1:01:58] power the Bible says Jesus himself said
[1:02:01] she can ask whatever she
[1:02:04] will she has the
[1:02:07] right to wield the the
[1:02:11] power a lot of power some power a lot of
[1:02:16] power there is power in
[1:02:19] submission as long as a woman submits
[1:02:22] herself to her
[1:02:23] husband
[1:02:25] in this case our husband is Jesus
[1:02:27] [Music]
[1:02:28] Christ please listen to me here now our
[1:02:31] husband is Jesus
[1:02:33] Christ and and and and and now Jesus
[1:02:35] himself our
[1:02:37] husband has said If any man abide in
[1:02:41] me and I abide in him he can ask for
[1:02:45] whatever he
[1:02:46] wants anything he wants he will have it
[1:02:51] what does that mean you cannot abide in
[1:02:54] Christ
[1:02:55] Christ unless you submit to
[1:02:58] him unless you obey every word unless
[1:03:02] you believe every word you have to do
[1:03:05] that in order for you to receive
[1:03:08] whatsoever you
[1:03:10] need if you are in your right place as a
[1:03:13] Christian if you are in your right place
[1:03:15] as a
[1:03:16] Believer whatever you
[1:03:19] desire am you have commanded
[1:03:22] it whatever
[1:03:25] the say whatsoever you
[1:03:27] desire ask and you shall receive how
[1:03:31] because you are in
[1:03:32] Christ if my people that are called by
[1:03:35] my
[1:03:36] name humble themselves and
[1:03:39] pray hear them you see so now the things
[1:03:44] that we
[1:03:45] desire it's not about Jesus doing
[1:03:50] them many things that we want him to do
[1:03:55] is in the power and control of the
[1:04:00] Bride he's waiting for you to come in
[1:04:02] your right
[1:04:04] place imagine
[1:04:07] sister if your husband tells you
[1:04:10] something and you don't obey
[1:04:13] him and then you tell him you know dear
[1:04:15] I need a new
[1:04:19] dress he'll just behave as if he'd never
[1:04:23] had
[1:04:25] I said I want a new
[1:04:27] dress he would just pass by I said I
[1:04:30] want a new
[1:04:31] dress and now you have become even a bad
[1:04:34] woman he will even not look at you at he
[1:04:38] will not hear you
[1:04:39] anymore but cook him some good
[1:04:42] food place the food on the
[1:04:45] table talk well to him talk
[1:04:48] nicely you know when he arrives at home
[1:04:52] create that atmosphere
[1:04:55] did you know that the power to build a
[1:04:58] home is in the woman's
[1:05:04] hand power is not in the man's hand is
[1:05:08] in the woman's
[1:05:09] hand listen church when you see women
[1:05:12] that are children that are
[1:05:15] spoiled in most cases it is their
[1:05:20] mother when you see good children who
[1:05:22] are good
[1:05:25] people appreciate the fathers but it is
[1:05:26] their
[1:05:29] mother even the words you speaking it's
[1:05:32] not because of your father it is not
[1:05:35] father
[1:05:36] tongue it is mother
[1:05:39] tongue the character you have is a is a
[1:05:43] is a transfer of the character of your
[1:05:46] mother the life the way of life you are
[1:05:49] living it came from your mother if you
[1:05:52] back a lot your mother was back a
[1:05:56] lot if you abuse your mother was
[1:05:59] abusing if you shout your mother was
[1:06:02] Shou if you're calm your mother was calm
[1:06:06] if you talk well your mother was that
[1:06:08] way so that character of a mother is
[1:06:11] always amen controlling the entire
[1:06:17] household and notti is here the woman
[1:06:19] has a certain
[1:06:21] power given to her but that power is not
[1:06:25] given us
[1:06:27] power that that power is engraved in
[1:06:33] weakness that strength is engraved in
[1:06:37] weakness by the woman amen submitting
[1:06:42] herself it seems as if she has come to a
[1:06:45] place of
[1:06:47] weakness but don't think it is a place
[1:06:51] of
[1:06:53] weakness place of power strength and
[1:06:57] Authority people see us following
[1:07:00] Jesus believeing everything the word
[1:07:03] says and they call us fools they call us
[1:07:07] holy rollers because we Shou in chch
[1:07:11] when the spirit comes upon us because we
[1:07:13] rejoice when the spirit comes upon us
[1:07:16] then they say we are fooled we have lost
[1:07:19] our mind but they don't know that is a
[1:07:22] position of power Str and
[1:07:27] Authority people even some some of them
[1:07:29] fear to cry in the
[1:07:31] church they fear to manifest
[1:07:34] emotion when they feel they're going to
[1:07:36] be
[1:07:37] emotional they try to control
[1:07:40] it come on come
[1:07:43] on don't be emotional let me tell you if
[1:07:47] you be like that oh you are not in a
[1:07:51] place of authority at
[1:07:52] all
[1:07:54] but brother sister if you can accept to
[1:07:57] be in a place of
[1:07:59] [Music]
[1:08:02] weakness crying many times is shown as a
[1:08:06] as a as somebody who is crying is is in
[1:08:08] a place of
[1:08:13] weakness and the one who is looking on
[1:08:15] is the one who is
[1:08:18] strong but brother sister strength is
[1:08:21] revealed in
[1:08:22] weakness
[1:08:24] strength is in
[1:08:26] weakness that person there who shattered
[1:08:30] who praying who crying is wielding a lot
[1:08:34] of strength that you don't even have an
[1:08:36] idea what it
[1:08:40] is you remember the woman
[1:08:43] called the the mother of
[1:08:46] Samuel she was just there at the
[1:08:49] altar praying
[1:08:52] crying
[1:08:54] and then when the priest came it looked
[1:08:57] as if the priest was the one who was
[1:09:00] strong and the woman was weak said what
[1:09:03] is wrong with you woman who told you to
[1:09:05] drink this ear
[1:09:09] hours and then you know he was a priest
[1:09:13] he was occupying an
[1:09:15] office the spirit of God Came
[1:09:20] Upon why what was that
[1:09:24] it was the power and the strength of the
[1:09:29] woman actually driving and controlling
[1:09:32] the
[1:09:34] priest when when the priest came he came
[1:09:37] with another
[1:09:39] attitude but when he arrived there the
[1:09:42] strength the woman
[1:09:44] had in her tears began controlling
[1:09:48] him and he that was saying why are you
[1:09:51] drunk why are you
[1:09:52] Dr it it was as if he was
[1:09:58] Bewitched what you want you shall have
[1:10:02] it God has given it to you where did
[1:10:05] those words come from it came from the
[1:10:08] tears of the
[1:10:10] woman strength is in
[1:10:13] weakness never never underestimate
[1:10:17] weakness whenever you are weak there is
[1:10:20] some strength
[1:10:22] somewhere there is strength that is why
[1:10:26] I want to make a
[1:10:27] statement there is nothing strong like a
[1:10:30] woman on
[1:10:35] earth a few amens because you have no
[1:10:38] revelation of what I'm talking
[1:10:41] about there is nothing strong on earth
[1:10:44] like a
[1:10:47] woman you you say Amen later on you will
[1:10:52] understand say Amen because you have
[1:10:54] understood you say Amen because you
[1:10:56] believe what I'm
[1:10:59] saying the woman is the strongest
[1:11:01] creature in the
[1:11:04] world praise the name of the
[1:11:06] Lord why because the Bible says she's a
[1:11:09] weaker
[1:11:11] vessel which means in her
[1:11:14] weakness she wields the power that
[1:11:16] controls the
[1:11:20] world look sin the devil could not bring
[1:11:25] sin without the
[1:11:30] woman not only that God could not bring
[1:11:34] Salvation without the woman so in other
[1:11:38] words the woman is on both
[1:11:42] ends she wields her strength she wields
[1:11:46] her
[1:11:48] power the man actually will listen to me
[1:11:52] the a man can never attain his
[1:11:58] potential his full
[1:12:03] potential to fulfill
[1:12:05] it without a
[1:12:12] woman that's why when God created
[1:12:15] everything he said it is good it's good
[1:12:17] it's good but when he saw the man he
[1:12:21] said it's not good it's not good why
[1:12:23] because a woman was
[1:12:25] missing the woman had to come in
[1:12:29] view for God to say it is good
[1:12:36] now

[1:12:41] now praise
[1:12:43] God Without
[1:12:45] You Christ is not
[1:12:50] complete he's the head but you are the
[1:12:52] body
[1:12:54] what is the head without the
[1:12:57] body it's
[1:13:02] nothing the head needs the body to
[1:13:06] function
[1:13:08] strength is in
[1:13:14] weakness I'm coming I'm coming to you
[1:13:15] I'm coming to
[1:13:17] you first Peter chapter
[1:13:21] 3 likewise he has dwell with them
[1:13:24] according to knowledge giving honor unto
[1:13:25] the wife as unto the weaker
[1:13:36] vessel now the Bible calls a woman the
[1:13:39] weaker
[1:13:41] vessel meaning if the woman is the
[1:13:43] weaker
[1:13:45] vessel she must be placed in a
[1:13:49] place where she has an opportunity to
[1:13:52] wield a certain strength
[1:13:56] strength that no one else can
[1:13:59] wield brother the message a greater
[1:14:04] witness a greater
[1:14:06] witness he says and you and when you you
[1:14:10] being when you can become nothing in
[1:14:13] your own
[1:14:19] sight you are becoming something in
[1:14:21] God's s
[1:14:25] and always remember this
[1:14:27] friends the Way Up Is
[1:14:30] Down tell your neighbor the Way Up Is
[1:14:34] Down brother Solomon tell your neighbor
[1:14:36] the way up is
[1:14:39] down if you want to go
[1:14:42] up go down if you want to be strong you
[1:14:46] have to be weak you cannot be strong
[1:14:50] when you are
[1:14:52] strong you have to be weak in order to
[1:14:55] be
[1:14:57] strong if you are proud you will be
[1:14:59] brought
[1:15:01] down if you are humble you will be
[1:15:04] lifted
[1:15:06] up and always remember these friends the
[1:15:08] Way Up Is
[1:15:11] Down he that EXs himself shall be a
[1:15:15] best but he that Humes himself shall be
[1:15:19] exalted whenever God speaks to you you
[1:15:23] should humble
[1:15:25] yourselves the reason why people don't
[1:15:27] experience
[1:15:29] God because they are
[1:15:32] proud what is a proud
[1:15:36] heart he that doesn't believe he that
[1:15:39] believes he has everything he
[1:15:42] needs like says we are
[1:15:45] rich we increased with goods and we have
[1:15:48] need of
[1:15:50] nothing because they thought like that
[1:15:53] God said you don't know you are poor you
[1:15:57] are blind you are naked and you don't
[1:16:00] know
[1:16:01] it why because they think they are
[1:16:04] something God said you are nothing and
[1:16:07] I'm telling you church if you think you
[1:16:10] are something you are nothing before
[1:16:13] God but if you think you are
[1:16:16] nothing here to tell you you are going
[1:16:18] to be something before
[1:16:21] God he says just love him with all your
[1:16:24] heart and forget all you ever know about
[1:16:28] all other things but Jesus
[1:16:33] Christ just go ahead and love him and
[1:16:37] work for him serve him like the woman
[1:16:41] loves the
[1:16:42] husband works for the husband you know
[1:16:46] in the Book of Proverbs it speaks about
[1:16:47] a a woman a virtuous
[1:16:51] woman how she wakes up
[1:16:53] ear books for the house work for the
[1:16:58] house why because she's a servant she
[1:17:00] like a servant serve him why it's a
[1:17:04] place of weakness it
[1:17:06] seems if he wants you to be the
[1:17:12] door just be the
[1:17:14] door it's whatever he wants you to
[1:17:18] do you do
[1:17:20] it God will bless
[1:17:25] you what if God wants you to be a be
[1:17:30] a lose your
[1:17:33] identity and receive his
[1:17:36] identity Lose
[1:17:38] Yourself and receive him don't look at
[1:17:42] me as if you're not hearing what I'm
[1:17:43] saying say
[1:17:46] am Amen in John
[1:17:50] 15:5 I am Divine he said
[1:17:54] and you are the
[1:17:55] branches he that abides in me and I in
[1:17:59] him the same bring forth
[1:18:02] much but for without
[1:18:06] me you can do
[1:18:09] nothing think about
[1:18:12] that God is saying you
[1:18:17] I we can do nothing without
[1:18:20] you if a man abide not in me
[1:18:24] he is cast forth as a
[1:18:27] branch and is
[1:18:29] withered and Men gather
[1:18:32] them and cast them into the
[1:18:35] fire and they AB
[1:18:38] bur without God you are
[1:18:43] nothing let me tell you whatever you
[1:18:46] want to accomplish
[1:18:48] life you can never accomplish anything
[1:18:51] without him
[1:18:54] what if you don't put God in your
[1:18:59] life you a
[1:19:02] loser Philippians 4:13 says I can do all
[1:19:07] things through Christ which strengthen
[1:19:10] me so in other words through him we can
[1:19:14] do all things without him we can do
[1:19:18] nothing so in other words he wants us to
[1:19:22] be to submit to
[1:19:25] him if we can submit to
[1:19:28] him there will be nothing
[1:19:32] impossible but without him we can
[1:19:36] accomplish
[1:19:37] nothing but with him there will be
[1:19:41] nothing
[1:19:44] impossible I am telling you even in your
[1:19:46] life if you can listen to the word we
[1:19:49] are preaching to you
[1:19:51] here every wedes every Friday every
[1:19:54] Sunday and you believe it and you do it
[1:19:59] there will be nothing impossible with
[1:20:03] you all things shall be made
[1:20:06] possible why because you have accepted
[1:20:08] to come to a place of
[1:20:13] weakness when you are in a place of
[1:20:16] weakness you are very
[1:20:18] strong you can do all
[1:20:21] things amen Amen Let Me Now give you a
[1:20:26] few examples now
[1:20:27] here in Luke 1:
[1:20:32] 38 Mary
[1:20:34] said behold the handmade of the
[1:20:38] Lord be it unto
[1:20:41] me according to Thy
[1:20:43] word and the angel departed
[1:20:46] from did you hear what Mary called
[1:20:51] herself
[1:20:53] made meaning a
[1:20:58] servant a
[1:21:01] nothing this is the Angel of the Lord
[1:21:03] Angel Gabriel when he
[1:21:05] came and he spoke to her the word of
[1:21:08] God Mary never
[1:21:12] doubted Mary
[1:21:15] submitted Mary listen
[1:21:18] submission does not mean
[1:21:21] agreement
[1:21:24] you know many times you know women think
[1:21:27] that they have to agree with their
[1:21:32] husband no submission does not mean
[1:21:36] agreement you may not understand what
[1:21:39] he's
[1:21:40] saying you may not even believe
[1:21:43] it you you can't make your mind agree to
[1:21:49] it but in your
[1:21:51] heart submit to it with all your
[1:21:54] heart you don't know how it can happen
[1:21:57] you don't know how it will
[1:21:59] be but you submit
[1:22:01] yourself you say you've said
[1:22:04] it I believe it that settles
[1:22:08] it that is
[1:22:10] submission now
[1:22:12] Mary when the angel
[1:22:15] came she was
[1:22:17] confused how will these things happen
[1:22:20] and and the angel told her the spirit of
[1:22:22] God will overshadow
[1:22:25] you and then Mary said the moment she
[1:22:29] heard let me ask you a question do you
[1:22:32] think that Mary knew how the spirit
[1:22:34] would
[1:22:37] overshadow did she have all
[1:22:40] answers she didn't have all
[1:22:43] answers but Mary
[1:22:45] believed and decided to
[1:22:49] submit now she was strong
[1:22:53] when she had her
[1:22:56] will but when she humbled
[1:22:59] herself his
[1:23:02] will she was no longer
[1:23:05] strong she was not
[1:23:07] vulnerable to his
[1:23:10] will be it unto
[1:23:12] me according to your
[1:23:15] word she was I'm the hand I'm I'm a
[1:23:19] handman I'm just as I'm nothing
[1:23:23] I'm just humbling myself here I don't
[1:23:26] know how it's going to be I don't I've
[1:23:28] never seen the spirit of a shadow
[1:23:30] anybody and they they become
[1:23:33] pregnant I've never seen how it happens
[1:23:36] I don't know how it is done all I know
[1:23:40] is you have said it and all I know is
[1:23:43] you are my Lord so I am saying let it be
[1:23:48] according to what you
[1:23:49] say and then she humbled herself
[1:23:53] that was
[1:23:54] submission did you realize that Mary at
[1:23:58] that time at that
[1:24:00] place she was put in a
[1:24:03] position of
[1:24:06] strength Mary accomplish something no
[1:24:09] man has ever
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:15] accomplished now tell me who is greater
[1:24:18] than a woman in the
[1:24:19] world Mary accomplish something
[1:24:23] Mary brought forth the
[1:24:27] Messiah the Bible tells
[1:24:29] us to Mary says you are
[1:24:33] blessed among all
[1:24:35] women you are
[1:24:38] blessed the blessing of God it maketh
[1:24:41] rich and he adds no
[1:24:43] soul Mary was blessed that means that
[1:24:47] she was the richest woman
[1:24:51] ever why because she submitted herself
[1:24:54] to the
[1:24:55] word
[1:24:56] submission is power and because she
[1:25:00] submitted she brought forth the
[1:25:03] Messiah none else could do
[1:25:07] it but the but a woman under
[1:25:12] submission a man could not do
[1:25:16] it a man cannot do it a priest could not
[1:25:20] do it an angel could not do it
[1:25:22] I don't know whether you understand what
[1:25:23] I'm talking about no one could do it not
[1:25:27] even the angels of God not even the
[1:25:29] biggest priest or the biggest
[1:25:32] Prophet but a
[1:25:34] woman I imagine that why because God
[1:25:39] wanted to show that strength is in
[1:25:44] weakness and the savior of the world
[1:25:47] came through a woman not just a woman
[1:25:52] but a woman who was nothing and
[1:25:55] nobody
[1:25:57] despised from a despised
[1:26:00] town she didn't even have a place to go
[1:26:02] to bring forth
[1:26:06] him he he came in a a very despised
[1:26:11] way powerful things come
[1:26:15] small small but the problem with our
[1:26:20] generation we all want big things
[1:26:24] when we see Small Things We despise them
[1:26:28] we want big things and we want them
[1:26:31] fast so we we leave what would have
[1:26:34] taken us to
[1:26:38] Greatness and we rush for the big things
[1:26:40] which will evaporate like
[1:26:44] Vapor but here is Mary she was humble
[1:26:48] she was down there and then when when
[1:26:50] the angel of the Lord came
[1:26:53] you know the Angels Came among the
[1:26:56] Shepherds who are the Shepherds they
[1:26:59] were the weakest they were the most
[1:27:02] despised and and and the angels of God
[1:27:05] did not come to the
[1:27:09] [Music]
[1:27:10] Palace there is something I'm coming
[1:27:13] to if you want God to speak to
[1:27:16] you if you want angels of God to come to
[1:27:20] you if you want to receive the holy
[1:27:24] SP humble
[1:27:27] yourself come down submit yourself to
[1:27:32] the the Way Up Is
[1:27:35] Down and the Prest were just the
[1:27:38] Shepherds were just you know uh watching
[1:27:40] over ship at
[1:27:43] night and then the angel showed her and
[1:27:46] they began singing they began telling
[1:27:49] them the
[1:27:50] news he's born
[1:27:52] the savior of the
[1:27:54] world
[1:27:56] born why preached a message why it had
[1:27:59] to be
[1:28:03] sheer God is revealed in
[1:28:07] Simplicity not in great big
[1:28:09] things not in standers and
[1:28:13] aspect but in a still Small
[1:28:16] Voice and many people Miss God because
[1:28:19] they're waiting for him to speak in a
[1:28:21] thunder
[1:28:24] they're waiting him to roar like a
[1:28:26] lion God speaks in
[1:28:29] Simplicity you may have a problem right
[1:28:32] now in your life and you are here
[1:28:34] listening to me but in this Simplicity
[1:28:38] God may be giving you
[1:28:40] Solutions but you may miss it if you
[1:28:42] don't see
[1:28:46] God God works in
[1:28:49] Simplicity he doesn't work in great
[1:28:51] stands and great big
[1:28:53] things he works in simple
[1:28:57] ways that's how he was
[1:28:59] born in our generation he spoke to us
[1:29:02] through a seventh
[1:29:07] grader he didn't have a degree in
[1:29:10] theology brother Bram was very
[1:29:13] humble he he claimed to know
[1:29:18] nothing and then God made him speak
[1:29:20] things
[1:29:22] bring
[1:29:23] Revelations that you could not even find
[1:29:25] with a PhD
[1:29:28] holder what was that strength in
[1:29:34] weakness and I tell you a
[1:29:37] woman is a weaker vessel and because a
[1:29:41] woman is a weaker
[1:29:43] vessel all through
[1:29:47] centuries God has used women
[1:29:50] mightly in ways he has never used men
[1:29:56] before if you study your Bible you will
[1:30:01] Marvel I've just shown you one example
[1:30:03] here of Mary of
[1:30:06] Mary the angel did not come to to assist
[1:30:13] him there was a a
[1:30:16] church there was a high priest there
[1:30:19] were ministers there were other prophets
[1:30:23] but God byass all of them there were
[1:30:26] Kings God byass all of them there was
[1:30:29] even a high priest who believed God
[1:30:33] cannot speak in his
[1:30:36] time not through
[1:30:38] him he thought God will only speak
[1:30:41] through
[1:30:42] him so I believe they had
[1:30:45] rumors that the angel came to a certain
[1:30:49] woman and said that you will have a
[1:30:51] child
[1:30:53] and the spirit will overshadow
[1:30:54] you and when the high priest maybe heard
[1:30:59] that just ignore
[1:31:01] ignore if it is God Why didn't it speak
[1:31:05] to me listen if you are still proud if
[1:31:09] you still think you are
[1:31:11] somebody God can never speak to
[1:31:15] you God does not deal with
[1:31:19] pride God deals with humility
[1:31:23] God deals with a soft
[1:31:25] heart a broken
[1:31:27] Spirit a contrite
[1:31:31] heart
[1:31:33] soul God deals with
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:37] such says he has left all the the big
[1:31:40] things of the
[1:31:42] world and he revealed himself to
[1:31:48] babes and he said the kingdom of God is
[1:31:51] likened unto a little
[1:31:54] child for God and angels to visit
[1:31:59] you you need to be
[1:32:01] helpless you need to be in a place of
[1:32:06] weakness and here is Elizabeth and
[1:32:11] Zariah let us look at it in the Book of
[1:32:13] Luke chapter
[1:32:16] 1 I'll just read in English
[1:32:20] listen verse 12 12 and when Zacharias
[1:32:23] saw him he was troubled and fear fell
[1:32:26] upon him but the angel said unto him
[1:32:28] fear not
[1:32:30] Zacharias Zacharias for thy prayer is
[1:32:33] heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear
[1:32:35] thee a son and thou shalt call his name
[1:32:37] John and thou shall have joy and
[1:32:40] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:32:42] birth for he shall be great in the sight
[1:32:45] of the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:32:48] nor strong drink and it shall be filled
[1:32:51] with the Holy Ghost even from his
[1:32:52] mother's womb and many of the children
[1:32:55] of Israel shall eat unto the Lord their
[1:32:56] God and shall go before him in the
[1:32:58] spirit and power of Elias to turn the
[1:33:00] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:33:02] and a disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:33:03] just to make ready a people prepared for
[1:33:06] the Lord and Zacharias said unto the
[1:33:11] angel whereby shall I know this for I am
[1:33:14] an old man and my wife well stricken in
[1:33:16] years what are you talking about angel
[1:33:19] huh in other words zakarias is telling

[1:33:40] God and I am sent to speak unto thee and
[1:33:42] to show thee these th GL Tidings and
[1:33:45] behold thou shal be dump and not able to
[1:33:48] speak until the day that these things
[1:33:50] shall be performed because thou

[1:33:54] words which shall be fulfilled in this
[1:33:57] season this is so touching to
[1:34:02] me here is an angel of the Lord that
[1:34:04] comes down to speak to a
[1:34:09] priest and the priest you would say is
[1:34:13] the best person to hear from
[1:34:18] God but when the priest when the angel
[1:34:20] of the Lord the angel of the Lord
[1:34:21] explained
[1:34:25] everything listen the angel of the Lord

[1:38:54] nonsense because of this you are going
[1:38:57] to be
[1:38:59] Dum oh
[1:39:01] God may God help
[1:39:04] us so that when the word comes we learn

[1:39:41] afterwards he says you are going to be
[1:39:43] dump you not speak a word you will not
[1:39:47] say anything do you know why because God
[1:39:51] did not want this man who doubted to go

[1:40:13] vessel I am going to go to my weaker
[1:40:16] vessel where I will show my strength
[1:40:19] Hallelujah

[1:40:29] 24 after those
[1:40:32] days his wife
[1:40:34] Elizabeth listen please
[1:40:39] conceived and he
[1:40:42] herself five months

[1:40:48] in the days wherein he looked on me
[1:40:53] to take away my repr among
[1:40:55] men I have a question for the church
[1:40:58] where did Elizabeth get these things
[1:41:01] from how did she not God dealt with
[1:41:04] her maybe God may not have said
[1:41:08] something but Elizabeth could sense the
[1:41:11] presence
[1:41:14] of women sense the presence of God
[1:41:17] better than
[1:41:19] men
[1:41:21] oh God make all the men like
[1:41:25] that
[1:41:27] Hallelujah one one one day young man
[1:41:29] came to say Pastor can you imagine today
[1:41:30] I cried in the church I said what are
[1:41:32] you talking about you should cry every
[1:41:39] service every
[1:41:41] service whenever you have an
[1:41:43] opportunity to be weak and
[1:41:47] vulnerable
[1:41:49] Hallelujah h
[1:41:52] Elizabeth she
[1:41:54] conceived and she began to give a
[1:41:58] testimony she wasn't there when the
[1:42:00] angel was
[1:42:01] speaking but that's just the
[1:42:04] beginning listen there is more
[1:42:06] sistera verse 59 and it came to pass
[1:42:11] that on the eighth day they came to
[1:42:13] circumcise the child and they and and
[1:42:17] they called him
[1:42:19] zacharius after the name of his
[1:42:29] father the child shall be called
[1:42:38] Zacharias Elizabeth was
[1:42:41] around and Elizabeth
[1:42:44] said what did you
[1:42:49] say he shall He Shall be Called
[1:42:55] John
[1:42:57] what Mary what did you say Elizabeth
[1:43:01] what did you
[1:43:03] say were you there when
[1:43:06] Gabriel where did you get the
[1:43:08] name you remember that was the first
[1:43:11] point the second point the
[1:43:14] Ang your wife shall have a boy and his
[1:43:16] name shall be
[1:43:19] John let me tell you a mystery the angel
[1:43:23] must have gone and told Elizabeth about
[1:43:26] this
[1:43:28] [Applause]
[1:43:32] news and he made sure he made zachar
[1:43:38] Dum the one who shall declare the good
[1:43:41] news will be a
[1:43:44] believer the one God will speak
[1:43:46] to will be a
[1:43:49] believer the one who the angels will
[1:43:51] appear
[1:43:52] to will be a weak
[1:43:55] person a real genuine believer of the
[1:44:02] supernatural hallelujah hallelujah so no
[1:44:05] my name is
[1:44:07] John and they said unto her what are you
[1:44:10] talking about
[1:44:12] woman there is no one in your among your
[1:44:15] family that are called by that
[1:44:19] name
[1:44:22] I love this
[1:44:24] church verse
[1:44:26] 62 and they made signs to his
[1:44:31] father so so they went to
[1:44:34] zakaras we want to know the name of the
[1:44:42] boy which means he couldn't even here he
[1:44:45] couldn't
[1:44:47] talk if you refuse to hear God he will
[1:44:50] make you Dum and
[1:44:54] death spiritually
[1:44:57] speaking and that you will no longer
[1:44:59] hear
[1:45:00] him friends I want to always hear
[1:45:04] God when God speaks I want to
[1:45:07] hear I don't want to hear him the second
[1:45:09] time I want to hear him the first
[1:45:14] time and he made signs to his father
[1:45:17] tell us the
[1:45:19] name bring me that
[1:45:23] table and I bought the table and he gave
[1:45:26] them the pen and he started
[1:45:32] writing
[1:45:35] John because he already had heard it
[1:45:37] from the angel you
[1:45:38] remember he already knew but because of
[1:45:41] unbelief God allow him to say it
[1:45:45] fast so God made him dump and when they
[1:45:50] brought a piece of paper and he wrote
[1:45:53] John everybody was
[1:45:57] like name same name like Elizabeth say
[1:46:02] and immediately when he wrote it down
[1:46:06] that is a sign of faith it is a sign of
[1:46:09] faith God opened him
[1:46:11] up he said now you can speak now you can
[1:46:15] speak because you have accepted to be in
[1:46:18] a place of
[1:46:19] weakness
[1:46:21] if you don't accept to be in a place of
[1:46:23] weakness God will never speak to
[1:46:27] you God speaks to you if you decide and
[1:46:30] accept to be a weak
[1:46:35] vessel that's why our sisters in that
[1:46:37] regard are better than
[1:46:41] us God has always spoke to women better
[1:46:44] than
[1:46:46] men even in a home God speaks to the man
[1:46:50] more than he speaks to the
[1:46:53] man that's why you should love your
[1:46:57] wife love her so much because the more
[1:47:00] you love her the more she will tell you
[1:47:03] about her secret talks with the Lord
[1:47:09] Jesus my good Lord that is if you
[1:47:12] married a
[1:47:15] Believer hallelujah oh my this is so
[1:47:18] wonderful let me give you one one last
[1:47:20] example and then we
[1:47:22] close you will just read directly from
[1:47:24] me Judges 13
[1:47:27] ver1 and the children of Israel did Evil
[1:47:30] again in the sight of the
[1:47:32] Lord and the Lord delivered them into
[1:47:35] the hand of the
[1:47:38] Philistines and there was a certain man
[1:47:41] called a certain man of
[1:47:44] Zora of the family of the
[1:47:47] danites whose name was man and his wife

[1:47:56] not another story are you
[1:48:00] interested would you like to hear all
[1:48:03] right and the angel of the Lord appeared
[1:48:05] unto the
[1:48:07] woman and said to her behold now you are
[1:48:12] bar and you bear not but you shall

[1:48:45] God from the womb and he shall begin to
[1:48:49] deliver Israel out of the hand of the
[1:48:54] Philistines how many points so many
[1:48:58] points God the woman was
[1:49:04] listening was
[1:49:05] amen then the woman came and told her
[1:49:10] husband saying my darling my dear
[1:49:14] husband a man of God came unto
[1:49:18] me and he continence was like the
[1:49:21] continence of an
[1:49:23] Angel very
[1:49:26] terrible but I asked him not when he
[1:49:30] was neither he told me his
[1:49:34] name but he said unto me behold thou sh
[1:49:38] conceive and bear a son and now now
[1:49:43] drink no wine no strong drink neither
[1:49:49] eat an unclean thing
[1:49:50] for the child shall be a
[1:49:53] Nazarite to God from the womb to the day
[1:49:55] of his
[1:49:59] death have you heard I wanted you to see
[1:50:02] a point there before we
[1:50:04] continue the woman did not ask
[1:50:08] anything everything the angel said she
[1:50:10] just said amen amen amen amen amen she
[1:50:13] even forgot to ask the name of the
[1:50:17] Ang and where you came from she just
[1:50:21] believed if it was the man let us
[1:50:25] see and her husband
[1:50:29] now when he had those things he went to
[1:50:32] prayer he said Lord let let the man of
[1:50:36] God which thou did send come again unto
[1:50:41] us and teach us what we shall do unto
[1:50:44] the child that shall be
[1:50:47] born and Goden to the voice of
[1:50:52] so you would think God would come and
[1:50:53] speak to
[1:50:59] man let us
[1:51:01] continue but the angel of God came
[1:51:05] again unto the
[1:51:08] woman as she sat in the
[1:51:12] field but manand was not even with her
[1:51:18] oh oh my God
[1:51:21] and the woman made
[1:51:23] Hast the moment she saw the angel she
[1:51:27] ran and she showed her husband and said
[1:51:30] unto him behold the man has come back he
[1:51:34] has appeared to me again the one came
[1:51:36] the other day and man arose and he went
[1:51:40] after his wife so the wife was
[1:51:44] running and and the man was
[1:51:46] following in spiritual things in
[1:51:50] spiritual
[1:51:53] things you need to work with your wife
[1:51:56] my
[1:51:59] dear because in because she's the weaker
[1:52:02] vessel God uses them so
[1:52:05] much in here she's
[1:52:08] leading Mana is
[1:52:10] following why because she can see what
[1:52:13] Mana
[1:52:14] cannot she can hear
[1:52:18] what what
[1:52:21] let me take you take me
[1:52:25] my now you you are very busy you want to
[1:52:27] marry a sex
[1:52:30] Queen how will she lead you to
[1:52:33] theel she will lead you to hell that's
[1:52:36] why when married
[1:52:38] Jezebel jeel led her
[1:52:41] to
[1:52:43] to the woman with the spiritual
[1:52:46] things the woman is the one to build
[1:52:48] your home
[1:52:52] that's why it says a foolish woman will
[1:52:54] te home with
[1:52:58] own sister if you allow that Bo music in
[1:53:01] your
[1:53:03] home you allow your children to sleep
[1:53:06] without
[1:53:07] praying you allow your home not to have
[1:53:10] a
[1:53:12] family because you not cooking in
[1:53:15] time and you're so tired and you're just
[1:53:18] sleeping without teaching your children
[1:53:21] how to
[1:53:22] pray your home is
[1:53:25] broken you have to lead the
[1:53:28] way as much as the man is the priest of
[1:53:30] the
[1:53:31] home the
[1:53:33] woman God has blessed her there to help
[1:53:37] build that
[1:53:40] home and so we see
[1:53:42] here many times God loves speaking to
[1:53:44] women
[1:53:47] fast even my wife God spoke to her about
[1:53:50] me before I knew that I was supposed to
[1:53:52] marry
[1:53:55] her my wife always
[1:53:58] shy when I say
[1:54:01] that like people
[1:54:07] think but it is
[1:54:10] biblical God works that
[1:54:15] way listen notice here so she leades the
[1:54:22] way and uh and uh man said unto the
[1:54:26] angel now they have
[1:54:30] arrived okay which verse were we
[1:54:36] on verse 11 and manah
[1:54:40] said now let thy words come to
[1:54:45] pass first of all he asked he went after
[1:54:48] his wife he came to the man and he said
[1:54:51] unto him Mr Angel tell me are you the
[1:54:55] man that spoke to the
[1:54:58] woman and the angel said I
[1:55:01] am and said now let thy words come to
[1:55:08] pass how shall we order the
[1:55:11] child and how shall we do un
[1:55:14] him imagine the man is asking many
[1:55:18] questions that's why God always comes to
[1:55:20] the woman because the woman doesn't have
[1:55:22] ask all questions the woman just
[1:55:23] believes be it unto me according to what
[1:55:29] say in one second the man has already
[1:55:31] asked two
[1:55:33] questions and the angel of the Lord said
[1:55:36] unto
[1:55:36] man of all that I said unto the woman
[1:55:39] let her be
[1:55:43] aware you man what are you talking about
[1:55:46] I've already spoken to your
[1:55:48] wife so whatever have said to her let I
[1:55:51] just be aware
[1:55:55] of praise God she may not eat of
[1:55:59] anything that cometh of the
[1:56:03] vine and blah blah blah and verse 15 and
[1:56:05] man said unto the
[1:56:07] angel I pray thee let us detain you
[1:56:12] here until we shall have made ready a
[1:56:15] kid for
[1:56:18] thee and the angel of the Lord said unto
[1:56:21] man though thou detain
[1:56:23] me I will not eat of thy bread and if
[1:56:28] thou offer a bur
[1:56:29] offering th must offer it unto the Lord
[1:56:33] for man knew not that he was an angel of
[1:56:35] the
[1:56:37] Lord and said the of the
[1:56:40] Lord knew
[1:56:43] not I wonder whether the woman knew
[1:56:47] not who told the woman that this was was
[1:56:49] a man of the
[1:56:52] Lord
[1:56:54] Revelation said unto the Ang of the Lord
[1:56:57] what is thy
[1:56:58] name that when thy sayings come to
[1:57:02] pass we may do thee
[1:57:04] honor the woman never asked the
[1:57:07] name this man is very busy tell us what
[1:57:09] is your
[1:57:11] name and the angel of the Lord said to
[1:57:14] him why do you ask my
[1:57:17] name why what is wrong with
[1:57:21] you it is a secret I will not tell
[1:57:26] you the angel could not disclose nothing
[1:57:29] to the
[1:57:30] man everything the angel told the man is
[1:57:33] what he had already told the
[1:57:36] woman and he told the woman he told the
[1:57:39] man when the woman was
[1:57:44] there are you following me now but the
[1:57:47] angel of the Lord did not
[1:57:50] praise
[1:57:51] God so man took a kid with a meat
[1:57:55] offering and offered it upon a rock unto
[1:57:58] the Lord and the angel did
[1:58:02] wondrously and manoah and his wife
[1:58:04] looked
[1:58:06] on it came to pass when the flame went
[1:58:09] up toward
[1:58:11] Heaven from off the altar that the angel
[1:58:14] of the Lord ascended in the
[1:58:17] flame and man and wife looked on
[1:58:21] it and fell on their face the
[1:58:24] ground but the angel of the Lord did no
[1:58:27] more appear to manoah and to his
[1:58:32] wife then manoah knew that he was an
[1:58:34] angel of the
[1:58:37] Lord said unto his
[1:58:41] wife we shall surely
[1:58:43] die because we have seen God oh man man
[1:58:48] what is wrong with men
[1:58:51] but his wife she said unto him if the
[1:58:55] Lord were pleased to kill
[1:58:58] us he would not have received a burn
[1:59:00] offering and meat offering at
[1:59:03] our a
[1:59:06] we receiving
[1:59:09] Revelation that is strength
[1:59:12] Church my God my God strength that a man
[1:59:17] did not have

[1:59:22] have received this offering from
[1:59:24] our neither would he have showed us all
[1:59:27] these
[1:59:28] things no would would would us at this
[1:59:32] time have told us such things as
[1:59:37] these and the woman not the man the

[2:18:08] me pastor preached last Wednesday I was
[2:18:11] not
[2:18:13] here I was watching

[2:18:27] movie he was preaching but when he was
[2:18:30] speaking he was speaking to
[2:18:33] me because that
[2:18:37] day I had just watched a brand new movie
[2:18:41] just
[2:18:43] out I was just from watching the movie
[2:18:46] but when I watched it
[2:18:50] when I saw the pastor
[2:18:53] preach he spoke it as he was
[2:18:56] concluding it touched my
[2:19:01] heart the spirit Came Upon me told me
[2:19:04] that this has been binding you at that
[2:19:07] time I felt power come
[2:19:13] down Lord forgive me forgive me

[2:19:40] rings I just switch it
[2:19:42] off
[2:19:44] amen and I would sleep again
[2:19:49] by the time I wake up at
[2:19:50] 6 it rings again I keep it keep
[2:19:57] it I would pray in the
[2:20:03] morning but when I heard
[2:20:16] that
[2:20:18] [Music]
[2:20:20] by the
[2:20:22] time even
[2:20:26] at when I'm
[2:20:34] already I didn't know in the past days
[2:20:37] when I was in the
[2:20:38] village I was
[2:20:41] young I would just come to the
[2:20:46] message I went back into the world you
[2:20:48] know the young man but when I was still
[2:20:51] in the
[2:20:53] village I left home I was so
[2:20:57] sick I was going to the hospital I used
[2:21:01] the taxi and I went when I
[2:21:09] reached I was by
[2:21:13] motyle most people think that when you
[2:21:15] fall when you fall and hit the forhead
[2:21:18] down you can not come
[2:21:20] back but I came up I just
[2:21:24] walked they went back
[2:21:27] home said they knocked
[2:21:30] me and they said you cannot put the
[2:21:36] down just
[2:21:46] knew you who are watching me
[2:21:49] here let us allow the holy spirit is
[2:21:55] real when you come into this message
[2:21:58] without
[2:22:07] faith that is
[2:22:14] how even in the movie in the phone I had
[2:22:18] told him that I deleted them I deleted
[2:22:21] them from the
[2:22:23] phone even now there
[2:22:27] is
[2:22:29] that when I remove
[2:22:35] them even when

[2:22:49] and joy I know why that the Holy Spirit
[2:22:54] us believe
[2:22:56] God when the man of God is
[2:23:02] preaching look at the man of God
[2:23:07] only theor saying

[2:24:07] process it wasn't
[2:24:10] easy but I want to thank God for
[2:24:14] that
[2:24:15] prayer I didn't want to involve
[2:24:20] anyone because I felt like people were
[2:24:24] tired every year giving
[2:24:28] birth so I wanted to do this
[2:24:34] time it's funny but that's how I
[2:24:39] feel so my mom could tell me tell me the

[2:24:50] they wanted to really support
[2:24:53] me and whenever they would call me I
[2:24:55] would rubbish
[2:24:58] them reached a time where everyone at
[2:25:01] work was so annoyed with
[2:25:04] me because they wanted to support me but
[2:25:06] I wasn't
[2:25:09] accepting I blocked
[2:25:12] myself and also the due dat was due but

[2:25:23] previous

[2:25:38] you and you could call me I would Dodge
[2:25:42] him so one day I was in the
