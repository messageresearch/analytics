[Music] Brother Joseph, Sister Mariam, and Lord, you knew them before the foundation of the world. And you saw this day coming to them. And Lord, they've gone through a a process, Lord, to get to this place. I ask, oh God, you bless them. And Lord, as brother Joseph has given these promises on this day of engagement, engage sister Marian, I pray that you will you will bless their union. Lord, they anticipate to have it in the coming days. Lord, Lord, their desires, dear father, but no doubt they need a lot of financial provision. They need a lot of protection, Father. Lord, we know the enemy is not happy when this happens. But Lord, we commit them into your hands, Lord. Father, that you will preserve them, Lord Jesus, until that day of their wedding, Lord, Father, and Lord, now in the name of our Lord Jesus, we pronounce them engaged in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. While they are still standing, um, we have a few pictures to show you. They have a few pictures to show you here. An announcement to give brother Marvin if you could get it. Okay, these are a few pictures. They already visited the home and um, I don't know everybody there, but I know sister was one of the people that represented us there. All right. Could you give me the next picture? Okay, you can see uh is there anybody we know there? Oh, Sam over there. And I think this is brother. Can Can you go back? Uh uh there's brother there, a friend of ours from that's brother Joseph who's brother right there as well. Brother Joseph. Okay, give us the next picture. Okay, continue. All right. So, that was on June 6th, 2025. Amen. And I love the way they did their their ceremony. They did the the and introduction at the same time. It saves them a lot of money and I think it was a good thing that the parents agreed to. You can copy that style. I really loved it. Continue. That's brother Joseph and his brother there. All right. That's them. Have you seen them? Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Right over there. Yeah. I don't know whether he took all those drinks by himself. [Laughter] So, brother represented us and his wife and uh we we we want to thank them. So, God bless you. God bless you, brother Joseph. Before they go. So, he's saying that introduction was 6th. Of course, I've already announced that. So, the wedding is slated for 22nd November. Uno um the wedding since since I think I don't know why you are putting the venue since you have a few other details here. I think I'll not read the venue for that purpose. So he has a note here. It says that the church wedding ceremony is open for everyone to attend but for reception one is required to have an invitation card. [Music] You can come invited at church. So the card will be distributed towards the wedding. I think they will distribute to those that they want to be at but I should presume maybe those who will support them or their friends and family. [Music] Uh that's self-explanatory and they're saying contribution to support the wedding is on a free week. So if you want, give. If you don't want, it's all right. That's what free will means. [Music] Anyways, that that is when you say directly. But but when you say politely, when you say it politely, they're trying to say all support is welcome. Every wedding, every marriage, we need to support them. Do we believe that they are ours? Let us stand with them. But they have their own arrangement. I heard they are not going to do meetings. They also not going to do WhatsApp groups. They they are ready to receive all your support. Free will. Is that is that understood? Brother Joseph, is that announced properly? God bless you all. Let us clap for them as they go back. Amen. [Applause] Amen. We happy to see when we see you know the young people getting married. We believe in marriage in the right way. Not just uh you know something you someone you find on the road and then you you you go get start a family. [Music] It has to be done advisably and in the fear of God. Shall we stand on our feet? Um before I forget, we have a meeting um after the service. Uh the people who should not miss in that meeting are group team leaders [Music] and those people who have been uh also on the committee for the youth meetings and church members who really feel that they they part of what we are doing. [Music] Please stay so we can discuss those. Shall we have the song redeemed how I love? have to proclaim it. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. For redeemed through his infinite mercy, his child forever. I am redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Glory, redeemed. Oh yes, his child and forever I am redeemed and so happy indeed. For yes, no language, my rapture continue. and know that the light of his pray with me that continual way. I'm redeemed. Oh, redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed. [Music] Redeemed. Where is forever am? I think of my blessed redee. Amen. I think of him all the day long. I sing for I cannot be s his love is the theme of my Amen. I'm redeemed. I'm redeemed. Redeemed. Redeemed by the blood of the lamb. Redeemed. Oh, redeemed his child and forever I am. Well, I know I shall see. It is bey [Music] king in whose law I delight. Amen.

[Music] redeemed this child and forever I am. Let's give the Lord a clap of praise. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Shall we please open our Bibles to the book of Revelations, chapter 5? Amen. I'm redeemed. And are you redeemed? Amen. This is what Christianity is all about. It's about redemption. Amen. We are reading uh we we we read last Sunday we read up to verses seven and I think we are going to read up to verses 10. There are many many things. Yes. I I I that I never really got to touch on on Sunday and by God's grace I hope that today we will be able to get into some and I saw I'm reading from verses one and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to lose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look their own. and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book, to read the book, neither to look their own. And one of the elders said unto me, weep not. Amen. I love this part. Weep not. Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David has prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven seals thereof. Amen. Tell your neighbor, don't cry. Amen. Amen. And I beheld and lo in in the midst of the throne and in the and in and and of the four beasts. And in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. [Music] And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. He alone was worthy. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them haps and golden vials full of orders, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof. And for thou was slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of the every kindred and tongue and people and nation. and has made us unto our God, kings and priests. And we shall reign on earth and we shall reign on the earth. How many believe that? Say amen. Amen. Please be seated. Um this morning I am dealing with uh really the title has not changed our true origin but I'm dealing with the grace met the requirement of the law. Grace met the requirement of the law or the law's requirement. The Bible says, "The soul that sinnth, [Music] that soul shall die." What is death? Death is total separation with God. Amen. Death is total separation with God. So now the soul that sinnth is the soul that that refuses to take God at his word. when God created Adam and and Eve. The Bible says he created them in his image in his image created he them male and female created he them. So now Adam, Adam was in the image of God, was in the likeness of God. Adam was like God. Because you see, God was a spirit. [Music] God is a spirit. John 4 24. The Bible says, "God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him in spirit. and in truth. So you cannot worship God in the flesh. That's why in in in chapter four, God tells John, come up hither. There is a certain level of revelation you have to be at to be able to worship God, to be able to understand God. Otherwise, if you are in the flesh, you can never understand God. You need to enter into the spirit. Things of the spirit are understood in the spirit. That's why in John chapter 3, you know Jesus told Nicodemus. You must be born again. It is a must for you to be born again. He says that which is born of flesh is flesh and that which is born of spirit is why do you marvel that I tell unto you that you must be born again because to be able to understand God and you cannot worship God unless you understand him but the kind of understanding I'm talking about I'm talking about the uh knowing who he is and you receive that understanding by the revelation which comes from God. [Music] So you cannot have that fellowship with God unless you are in the spirit. You should you should not know Jesus after the flesh. You should know him after the spirit. The problem we have with Christianity, many people know God after the flesh, but you must know him after the spirit. There are many people that were with Jesus and they touched him. They fell, but they did not understand who Jesus was. They did not have a revelation of who Jesus was. Amen. And you know even Jesus himself asked them who the people say that I the son of man are and then they began to say some say you are Elijah or you are Moses or you are you know one of the prophets but then he said what about you? So even I ask you this morning what about you? Who do you say that this Jesus is? Who do you say this message is? You know, and Peter was in the flesh and he was seeing Jesus. Maybe he was close with you, but something happened to him in that moment. Something struck you and revelation hit you. Hallelujah. You know, when revelation hits you, you receive, you get stimulated. These things that I'm getting into are really very delicious. So, you have to be appetized to hear them. Amen. So when revelation hits you, you get stimulated and the stimulation you receive becomes like the stimulation that a drunkard has. When someone drinks alcohol, even when they were humble, it hits them and then they begin to feel very happy. Are you drunk? something happened to them. They they stimulated from the inside and it comes on their flesh. That's that's a natural drunk command. But it is the same same thing. You are spiritual drunk man. When revelation hits you, you will behave like a naturally drunk man. You get excited. You begin shouting. You begin rejoicing, you begin, they say, "What's wrong with you?" That's why on the day of Pentecost, when they were drunk, they began speaking in tong. They began getting excited. They jumped up and down. And they said, "What is wrong with these people? Are they drunk at this early hour in the morning?" And then Peter jumped up. He said, "Hallelujah." Hallelujah. Amen. Let me tell you people these people are not drunk with even as he supposed but they are drunk with the spirit. So which means when you drink in the spirit when you come when you enter into the realm of the spirit where you begin to understand God there is no way you can remain sober. You become spiritually drunk. You become excited in your soul that it will even show on your body. That's why sometimes people begin to shake. You begin to shout. People begin to run around. Sometimes they fall. What's happening? They drown. And let me tell you, you need to understand that. You need to come into that realm. But if you are in the flesh, even if you're sitting around a table where men are drinking, but if you are in the flesh and you are seeing the drink, but you are not touching the drink, let me tell you, you will be in the flesh. You won't understand why they're behaving the way they behave. But let me tell you, brother, sister, touch, they drink, they drink. you will behave the same way. That's what happened. So let us now begin to soar up into the realm of the spirit this morning and we see what can happen in our own individual lives. Praise the name of the Lord. So God is a spirit. You need to enter into the spirit to understand God. And we see uh you know this man called Peter. You know as Jesus asked him what about you? What do you say about me? And Peter entered into that room and then maybe he must have Jack. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thou art at Christ the son of the living God. No natural man could say that. For Peter to say that he meant that Jesus is God in flesh. Who could say that? Everybody saw him as a prophet. Everybody saw him as a son of Mary. Everybody saw him as a son of Joseph. Others saw him as B. Other saw him as a confer. We talked we talked about that already. Others said you have a demon. Others they said you are even the head of God. Others they said you you deserve to die. And the best of them, they saw him only as a prophet. But Peter drunk of the spirit of revelation. He said, "You are Jesus Christ, the son of the living, not the son of man." Notice Jesus asked them, "Who do they say that I the son of man am?" Son of man and son of God are different. Son of man means a prophetic ministry. A man, a prophet can only be a human being, a man. But son of God is higher than son of man. Son of God is God himself in human flesh. So now Jesus asked them, "What about you? Who do you say that I the son of man are?" So Peter entered another realm, another dimension. And he saw what others could not see. And he said, "Haha, you are Jesus Christ, the son of God." And Peter said, and Jesus answered them. He said, Peter, flesh and blood has not revealed this, my father in heaven. Where is heaven? Heaven is a dimension. Peter was on earth, but he had entered into that dimension right on earth. And he said, "My father in heaven has revealed me." Hallelujah. Open your eyes. And now you know who I am. And he said, "Therefore, I will tell you, Peter, upon this rock, upon this revelation, the revelation that only if you enter into the realm of God, you can receive upon this revelation who I am." Amen. I will build my church. And the church of Jesus is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus is not a man only. He was more than a man. Jesus was not only a prophet. He was more than a prophet. Who is Jesus? Jesus is God himself in human flesh. Hallelujah. Amen. Can we go a step higher? Can we go a step higher? Jesus spoke to them and he said, "Ye are gods." Now the Bible says, "Amen. Now are we the sons of God, not the sons of men, but the sons of God." And he says, "It does not yet appear what we shall be, how we shall look, but where he come, we we we are sons of God. shall be like him. So in the same way today I can say the same thing that who are the sons of God? Those who have received the revelation of who they are. Amen. Now if you receive the revelation that you are a son of God, you cannot walk in this world as a defeated person. Are you hearing Sister Grace? Grace, even if things are hard, even if you know the tr the what you call facts, you know, let me tell you, a son of God does not rely on facts, a son of God does not speak facts, a son of God does not look at facts. A son of God looks at truth, speaks truth, Jesus said, "Who among you here can condemn me of sin? was no longer allowed. Look at you. Christ in me. That is my only hope. That's my only hope of glory. Christ revealed in me. So when brother Bam preaches Christ is the mystery of God revealed, he's not talking about Jesus of 2,000 years ago. He's talking about Amen. that Christ today revealed in you. When he's in you, God is revealed. Meaning you a God today when you are redeemed. Hallelujah. Amen. How was Adam before the fall? Before he went onto the other side of the castle. When he was on this side of the castle before the fall, he was just like God. Same power, same authority. You understand? in the image, in the power. His word was as good as God. So he was the mystery of God revealed. He was God on earth. And when Jesus came, he confirmed the same thing. He told the Jews doesn't the Bible say that ye are God. Now when the fall came that mystery was he no man [Music] came even close to that glory. The Bible says we have all sinned and come short of the glory of God. Why? Because we are born in sin. Not because we did something bad. Who is a sinner? is not the person who has done something bad. That's why sin is not adultery, fornication, smoking, drinking and all these things because even the person who has never done those things as long as born by a woman is a sinner. So what is sin? Sin, amen, is if you are born of a woman, you came to the world speaking lies, you are you came short of the glory because you did not believe. Adam did not believe by and Eve did not believe by obeying what Satan said and living what God said. And from that day Adam and all his lineage were sinners. We were not there physically but we were there in Adam. So because of that we were all born on the other side of the castle in sin clouded with sin come short of the glory of God filled with ammonia not knowing who we are filled with regrets filled with problems poverty sickness suffering trouble that's what this other died introduced to us so bad that man that is supposed to be God on earth was born and we begin to think that this is who we are. When the devil tells you go and fornicate the body agrees you say it's all right. You think that's what you are? Go to the disco. You just go willingly. Go and put on makeup. Dress skimpy clothes. Do this and that. Young man and then he Why? Because you're born confused. you you forgot who you are. Amen. Legalism cannot remind you who you are. It takes you deeper in jail. And then you come to church fearing they may see me and they will judge me. They will see me and condemn. We are not condemners. We are not here to judge you. We are here to remind you where you are. Hallelujah. We are here to remind you who you are. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are here to remind you. You have not always been that way. There is a better life. Where is that better life? That life is in a place where you were supposed to be. But sin separated you. But thank God through Jesus Christ, we have been redeemed. We have been redeemed back. Redemption is not forgiveness. You did nothing to begin with. Redemption is to remind you who you are. What were you in the mind of God? You were perfect. In the mind of God, you have never sinned in the in the mind of God. You have been in the image of God. Your word is as good as it was. In the mind of God, you had the glory. But sin blocked you. But after Jesus died, I will tell you what happened. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. by the bleach of the blood removed everything and now an entrance has been ministered. So you cannot be denied. You cannot be denied entrance. If you if you want to leave to live holy, you can't be denied anymore. If you want to break out of that, you cannot be denied. Amen. If you want to live for, if you want to overcome the world, if you want to overcome the world, if you want to be like a child of God, you cannot be denied today. Anyone enter the Holy of Holies and test of the grace. Grace met me. grace met what the Lord desired. Hallelujah. Amen. That this is the message of the hour. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. He is just so lovely. Very very lovely. And they sang a new song. I will not go back in in from vers five we from verses one we talked about on Sunday but maybe I can rehearse a little bit for those who are not here and here was a book from the moment Adam sinned the moment Adam sinned listen carefully the authority that he had amen that he had the glory that he had is the The Bible calls it a sevensealed book. A title did the book of redemption. When Adam sinned, all those things he fored it. And Satan was watching while Adam was losing his title. did. But suddenly his hands were filthy. So he could not take the book. He could not put his hands that hands on the book. Therefore, Satan does not possess the book. He possesses what belongs to you, but he doesn't have the authority. [Music] Okay, let me put it this way. He has your land, but he doesn't have the title deed. He has your joy, but he doesn't have your the title to heal. He has your healing. He's cap capturing you in chains of sickness. is capturing you, you know, in chains of defeat until you get into certain kinds of addictions and the devil tells you you you better accept you are like this and then you also begin to agree for us we are poor accepted we are poor in our home we cannot get rich in our home we can probably They me that is what people are involved in. No wonder they move around all churches to break curses. What is what are they seeking for? They are seeking for the lost glory. But no church has your lost glory. [Music] that only one is worthy and that the lamb, the lamb of God, his name is Jesus. Amen. He was only one worthy. Amen. They go here to try and restore the glory. But no one can restore the glory. And others in the process decide to accept they are born that way. There is nothing they can do about it. I am here in the name of the Lord to tell you. There is something you can do about it. Do not accept defeat. Amen. Hallelujah. No retreat. No surrender. I say no retreat. No surrender. You better say, "I will fight until the last drop of my blood." But I can assure the devil, he will never see the last drop of my blood. Meaning he cannot finish me because he has already seen the last drop of the blood of my savior. [Applause] Amen. Don't accept defeat. Amen. You run away. Run away from that evil, that burden that easily beset you. Well, if you can't run, someone said, "If you can't run, you can at least walk and walk in the right direction. If you can't walk, when are you going to die? You going to give up? Don't give up, brother. At least grow. Do something. but go to the right direction. Amen. Amen. And the book could not go in the dirt hands of Satan. Satan may have what belongs to you, but he doesn't have the authority to eat. So now the book could not go to Satan. He couldn't return to Adam because Adam was now a sinner. So the book went back to the original owner, the giver of it, God himself. And now the Bible says, "And I saw in the right hand of heaven sat on the throne. I saw a book written within on the back side filled with seven seals." And I I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy?" And you know that challenges to to everybody in heaven and everybody on earth. Who is worthy to open the book or to lose the seals there? No man in heaven, nor in earth made under the earth was able to open that loop thereon. And John wept much because he understood the human race was dumped. There is nobody able to redeem him from the fallen race to the fallen side back again into the glory. Amen. And John wept much because there was no one found worthy to read a book neither to God. But you see as he was weeping we found this on Sunday voice spoke to him from one of the elders. And we noticed that this elder was actually John himself. So you see it was a revelation he received and I said John spoke to John right and said weep not weep not you see it's not an angel going to come and tell you even as I'm preaching to you you yourself amen if you a son of God in the mind of God the When you hear the word, something in you is quickened. It begins leaping. It begins jumping. You begin to feel excitement. You begin to feel something. Yes. That's why you are here. That's why you keep coming. That's why you keep coming regardless of the things that distract you. Because there is something in you that is saying yes. Amen. And something in John said weep not I can almost hear something in me saying weep not weep not. Oh can I preach to you for a moment? It doesn't matter what you're going through. That voice of God speaking to you. It's not a time of weeping. It's not a time of crying. It's a time of you realizing who you are. Don't feel sorry for yourself. Stop being in that condition. Come to a place of realizing you know what I am not born to be this. I am born to be a child of God. Like that little eagle, you know the story of the little eagle. She was born under a hen. A farmer went and picked an egg and put the egg under the the chicken. And when the chicken hatched the eggs, all of them were cheeks apart from one which look different. He kept wondering. Everybody was scratching. But for for for it she couldn't scratch. She felt different. It's like as if there is something inside you that told it you are not born to scratch. You are born to fly high and you are born to take a fresh but he did not know how because it never never understood why it was born this way. But one day, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The mother eagle came. And as mother eagle came squaring the whole place, and began calling, calling all the other chicks. They heard the cry of the mother hand, hide, hide for your life. Hide for your life. Because in the in the chicken family, ego is an enemy. Hide for your life. So every chick if you have ever seen them, they will hide in a split of a second and mother will be there trying to make himself even when he's nothing. Denominations are nothing. They have nothing for you. The vitamins you have. Mother ego has them. Hallelujah. I'm so glad you brought me out. I cannot go back there. I have realized who I am. I am not a chick anymore. I am an eagle. I am born to fly. Amen. Amen. And as mother eagle was coming, he said, "Hey, hey, Junior, what are you doing there?" And and at the same time, Junior was just there, Junior Eagle, and Mother Chicken was saying, "My boy, [Music] I can't understand that. Why do I have to hide from a voice that sounds familiar? Hallelujah. Yes, sir. When you heard the message, it sounded familiar to you. Something in you told you that is the truth. Hallelujah. I mean in your denomination, they were telling you, "Run away. That's false. Run away. Run away. That's a cult. False religion. They are worshiping men. But something in you told you no. I can feel the connection. I don't see a cow here. I see the worship of the Holy True Lord Jesus Christ. And mother ego kept calling. I know mother ego will keep calling. The Bible says I am at the door and I know he that hears and open for me. I will come in. I will feast with him and he with me. Father Eagle is calling on your heart and he called on us. I don't know where you are. But I'll tell you where I was in my denomination. Amen. I was only 15 years when I had mother ego call and I felt that was something like I know And I came out of Anglicanism. I can never go back. Even you, brother Sadat. You may be hearing new things, wondering what is this. You may not understand a thing. But if you're sick, something in your heart is telling you, there's something about this. I want to put my hands on him. If you a seed, it doesn't matter where you are born. You may be born in a Muslim family. You may be born under the Buddhist. You may be born under the Anglican Catholic, the Roman Catholic state, the it doesn't matter. When you hear the cry of the mother, you'll begin to spread your wings. So little Junior began spreading her wings. Mother Hen couldn't understand. I c you children. Look at your brother from today. I c him. He will die. How can he defy my orders? Mother Ed couldn't understand. And nobody could cast that mother that little ego. Chicken cannot kill an eagle. [Applause] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. And and and you know, little junior began spreading the wings and then felt strength coming. Faith is in you. Faith is a revelation. You may not know how but something in you will reveal to you who you are. You say you know what you can overcome this situation. You are a child of God. You are a daughter of God. Somebody who may help you. God can help you. And then you begin to feed on that. You begin to hear the word and help you. Strength begins to build up. And mother was saying, "Junior, you can do it. You can do it. You can do it." And then eventually Junior never understood what happened. But the moment she was airborne, she she realized the power that makes her rise is already in the sky. Hallelujah. The power that will make you overcome the world is in the Pentecostal sky. Begin flying. Begin flying in revelation. Begin flying in the baption of the Holy Ghost. Begin flying in one go. Begin flying in the opening of the spirit. Begin fly. Begin flying by saying amen to every word. When you eat the message, you realize you are flying. You're flying. And little ego said, "I can never go back." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. This joy that I have, the devil never gave it. Something happened on the ego. This joy that I have, the devil never gave it. All this joy that I have. Meanwhile, mother never gave it to me. Mother never gave it. all over me. He's keeping me alive. What is it? It's the Holy Ghost and flying. And let me tell you, we are flying in revelation in our day. [Music] It's not one man with revelation collective body of Christ. Amen. Amen. Let me tell you something. We have gone beyond one man ministry. That is why even when God heals you, a miracle is done. We don't give testimonies like the Pentecost. I was dying. And then the man of God We are beyond that. You know who you are. The power that makes you know where it comes from. We are no longer seeking for anointed ones because we we know we ourselves are anointed. Hallelujah. You get the point. It's no longer one man's ministry. That's why we rest. Stop going from hiking from church to church. We are looking for anointed ministry. In this message, there is no one man that is anointed more than others. It is an anointed message. Hallelujah. Are you following what I'm saying? So what I'm saying when you receive the anointed message, you will begin to respect and honor every ministry that is preaching the revealed word and you will be stable where God has placed you and you will serve God and love you and grow in the stage of Christ. That's why we are no longer preaching ourselves. No. Whenever you see a minister s up on the pulpit and begin to everything, there's a problem. I tell you, run away. The day I become like that, all of you run away. I'm warning you now. It's not me speaking. Is God speaking? Run away. It's not about a man. It's about the word. We're not preaching to you to to to be uh to to pay allegiance to a man. To hang on to a man. Hang on to the word. Hang on to Christ. The revealed word of the earth. His word will take you over into Amen. And there was nobody able to open the book and to lose the seals there. What is this book? It's the book of redemption. It's back into the hands of the original owner. But you know what? He came right down to the book and he lose the sins. Amen. Hallelujah. And then the Bible says, "And they sang a new song." Amen. Saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals there. For thou was slain, and you are redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kind right now, people and nation. This seven sealed book is not some kind of mysterious thing. I was telling the brother the other day it is a sevensealed book but you see the Bible said uh it was written don't miss this now and on the back side say amen if you on the back side what do we see Whenever a seal is open, we see a symbol. What do we see? First horse rider, white horse rider. Then after the white horse rider, we see the red horse. Then we see the black horse rider rider, you know, sold under the altar. These are symbols and all these symbols are on the back side of the book. There is something else within the sales. And let me say allow me to say this. This is the real opening of the seal. What is within? Remember this is the book of redemption. Redemption. It is pointing to something. Somebody has to be redeemed. So what is it about? The one on the inside. It's about that one. I don't know what you understand by that. But I'll tell you, I am the one on the inside. This is all about you, the bride, and about the lamb taking the book to redeem the blood. That's why after the opening of the script there was a new song s you are slain and you have redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred out of every kind out of All tribes all over the world. It doesn't matter your tribe. He has redeemed out of each tree. This is not the redemption of Jews. The redemption of Gentiles. Open your eyes and see. This is about you. Even the mystery nature which has been healed. Hallelujah. Revelation 10 as the seventh angel as the as the angel as the angel came down with a cloud around his head with a rainbow around his head. Follow me now. I'm going ahead out of my my not here but it's all right. A third angel came down. Revelation 10:1 can put it up on the screen. And in his hand was a what? A little book open. Are you following me? Are you enjoying this? A little book open. In his hand was a little book. Connect with me now. Amen. As that angel came down, he had in his hand a little book open. And the Bible says, he set his right foot upon the sea. And and and his left foot on the earth. And all right, continue. And he had in his Okay, give me three, brother. And he cried with a loud voice as when a lion roarth. And when he had cried, seven what? Seven thundersed there. Okay, remember thunder is a voice of God and it is saying something four. And when thunder that voices, John was about to write But I he said I heard a voice from heaven saying, "These are the seals that were within not which the seven and write them not." Oh my I wish I'd continue on that but for later. But I wanted to say this. Brother Bham says you if you you're baptized in the Holy Ghost born again and changed you come to a place where you you become a thunder to the devil whereby he doesn't know what to do. anymore. The thunders is not something coming or a revelation. I am a thunder to the devil. The book of redemption is about you and Christ. You and the lamb. And you have redeemed us to God. It was about the bleach, the bleach of the blood. There was nothing could could cleanse us or or wash take away our sin. We were in sin. We are defeated. But he says like a drop of ink falls into a bleach. What happened immediately? The black stain is gone. You couldn't find it again if you had. It's gone. You will never see it no more. What happened now? You don't see some nothing come come from it. Why don't you? Because it's broke up. And now science says it has turned back into its original. What did the acids come from? Where come from? It come from certain things. All right. Say for instance like fumes made acids made acids fumes made acids. I I will call a science teacher to come and interpret this part. Where did fumes come from? Well, it was we will say fumes was made of molecules. Where did molecules come from? From atoms. Where did the atoms come from? From electrons. [Music] This one is a seventh grader speaking this thing. Where did they come from? Cosmic light your plan back again past finding chemist now. And if it it's a substance and a creation, it has to come from a creator. So you are not sitting here by chance. There is reason for you to believe. there is some reason for you not to believe also just like with that ink. When a man sinned, he separated himself from God and crossed the great chasm and put himself in death on this side. There is no way back. There's no way for him to go back. But when he did, God accepted a substitute which was a lamb, something for blood, which Adam spoke or rather spoke on the other side of the castle on that side on the other side of the castle. He's a son of God. He's an offspring from God. He is an inheritance of the earth. He can control nature. He's not talking about somebody. He's talking about you. What you can do. You are a son of God, an offspring from God. You have the inheritance of the earth. You can control nature. He can speak into existence. Have you not seen people who say that they can stop rain with witchcraft? Have you not seen? Answer if you have seen. Now that authority doesn't belong to them. They are impersonators. It belongs to a son of God. We are the ones with that kind of authority. Have you not seen people who uh they say that they are snake whispers, whisperers or something like that? Like I mean they calm down them down and they talk to them and they others they t lions. Some of them like here in Africa they use witchcraft to do that even when they become so big. Witchcraft is only a perversion of the power of God. It only comes to show original somewhere. So these things are telling us if you see fake money, it means there is original money. Except when I tell you what I'm telling you, if you are when you become a son of God, you have realized who you are, you can control nature. You can speak into existence. You are a creator yourself an offspring of God. Many times we want to say let there be this. And we want to close our eyes and open. But remember God said let there be man in my image. It must have t it might have taken billions of years. We don't know how long it took. It took so long. But when God speaks a word, it can't fall to the ground. It comes back again and it will always be fulfilled. Whatever he says. It may not happen like but it will always happen. But when he crossed he separated his sunship. He's a sinner by nature. He's under the hands and dominion of Satan. And God took a sacrifice, a chemical of the blood. But the blood of bulls and God did not divorce sin. It only covers sin. And I've got a red spot on my hand and and cover it with white. And red spot is still there. It's still there. But God sent down from heaven. A bleach. A bleach. Everybody say a bleach. For sin. It was the blood of his own son that when our confess sins drops into God's bleach, [Applause] try to find it again. The coloring of sin, it goes back through the mediators down through time until it hits the accuser, Satan and lays on him till the day of judgment. What happens to the son? He becomes in perfect fellowship with the father again. standing on the other side of the no remembrance of sin against him no more. There is no more stain of bleach can be seen anywhere. He is free. That ink can never be ink no more because he's broke up and sent back again. And when confessed sin is confessed and being dipped into a man or a woman that's been dipped in the blood of Jesus Christ, it kills all symptoms. never to come in remembrance no more. And a man, now stay with me here, and a man stands justified as a son of God. Praise God. Praise God. Now, I want you to listen to this part. The for the fortified title deed, the for title deed rather is now in the hands of the original owner. The title deed is to the earth and to eternal life. When Adam fulfeated it, then Satan's hands could not take it. He went back to God. We are going to find it just in a minute. There he sits on the throne with it in his hand. Oh, that makes me feel religious. If they had stolen your title deed, found it. Somebody holding it. How do you feel? You have gotten the title again. People killed each other because of landing. But for us, we are ready to kill Satan and all his demons. We must get our hands to this title. Hallelujah. Amen. When you get your hands to the title, you can no longer live the way you've been living in it. You realize there's a better life. That's what this message is all about, friends. The title D to eternal life. And he calls it the abstract title D to eternal life. When Adam forfeated it for wisdom instead of faith, it went back to the hands of the owner, the almighty God. What is it doing in the hands of God? Listen now. I I want to try and climax for this service tonight. What is it doing in the hands of God? Why does God have He's waiting for redemption claims. He's waiting for someone to claim it. Someone who has claimed redemption, it has to either be Adam or his brother. Hallelujah. Are you following me? Adam, that's the law of Adam. But Adam was not worthy. None of his natural brothers was worthy. So God being God, he said, "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I will become." [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. And then he came Amen. As a lamb. That's why when John turned to see, he saw a lamb, a slain from before the foundation, he made a way of redemption. He made a way back. And someday the redeemer is to take it back. You see where we are going to get now? We will watch this fellow sitting upon the throne waiting for redemption claims. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise the name of the Lord. I have many things to read for you. But let me try to sum up the service. He says, "But God is law received a substitute. What if God had not offered to take a substitute? What if God had not offered a substance? Do you want to see what he says next? But love, tell your neighbor, love. Love constrained him to do. That man was without a way back. And there is no way for him to get back. He was gone. Yes, he's talking about me. But the grace of God made this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Lord required death. Lord required to claim this book. And you cannot claim the book without paying the price. And the price was dead. But God became man. Forget about the trinity teaching. They teach three gods instead of one. We don't believe in no three gods. We believe in one god. And that god is a spirit. But God became man. And he came, he became man to do what? To pay the price. So that he can bring Oh mama, listen to me in our church. So that he can bring forth the bleach. the bleach of the blood which will make Adam and his entire race free which would give Adam and access to go back into the holy of holies to go back in the garden. So now take me into the holy take me in by the blood of the someone receiving this revelation tonight. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. I said hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That man was without a way back and there's no way for him to get back. He was gone. But the grace of God met this kinsman redeemer in the person of Jesus Christ. The law. The law required it. And grace met its requirement. Hallelujah sons of Yahu. Grace met the requirements of the law. How amazing grace how sweet a sound. God's law required an innocent substitute. And God himself said no angel will do it. No man is worthy. I am going to do it. God himself came down and he died that he may make a way for you to your true origin. Some of you who receive this revelation, you will begin to tell the devil. Amen. Not here even there. When he begins to torment you, tell him, "I am not what you think I am." begin to practice that. You are going to see what will happen. Amen. If you are poor, begin to say, "I am rich." If you are bound by sin, you begin to say, "I am not a sinner. I am holy. I am righteously forgiven. I'm redeemed." Grace met the Lord's requirement. Tell me, what did the thief on the cross do? Nothing. He accepted grace. For because grace had already met the requirements of the Lord. How do you receive grace? How do you accept it? By accepting the word of your day, if you walk away from it, no more forgiveness, no more redemption for you because the word is Christ. And the word at that moment was right there on the cross with them. The other one was laughing. He had no revelation. Save us and yourself. If you are saying you are who you say you are, look at this fool. No revelation. The Bible says a fool has said in his heart is not God. And here is a fool who could stand before God and say if you say you are save us and yourself. One of man who had revelation what you fear God who told him this is God revelation grace opened don't you fear God and then he turned to Jesus he said remember me when you come into [Music] I am that thief I am that dying thief. Remember me. Bring me to your kingdom. Our father who art in heaven. Be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Thy kingdom come. His kingdom is here in the form of the word. When they reject the word, they have rejected the king. When you accept the word, you have accepted. And as I finish, I'm done. Actually, stand on your feet. That man, when he died, he died. All right. Both of them died. All right. But one of them went into the kingdom. There were two places and they were kept in. The ones who refuse to believe were always going in a in in in the in a place of of torment and the others would go to paradise under the blood of bulls and goats. But the but the fresh one was this thief on the cross. When Jesus went into hell things I want to tell you he opened the other door and the others oh save us open for us. You open the door. Said, "Why didn't you believe and he banged the door, walked away?" Remember, he had already gone. After that, he went right to hell and he took the keys from there. That that devil, Jesus has the keys, the authority. He has it all. That's why he's our redeemer. That's why he he he can speak. And when you receive him in your heart, you two can now speak. As musicians come and at that moment, you know, he walked by and this is the part I love most. He he entered the other place and he started. He was not dead. He never died. He was very busy in hell. When he says he preached to the souls in prison, those are the ones who never believe and he did not preach to them to be saved. He preached to condemn them. But he went over to his friends, the ones that had believed and Sarah said, "Darling, darling, you know Abraham, who is that one knocking? Go and check." You know, Abraham is the father of the faith. Must have been the one that kicking the door. She went to check and after she opened the door, she began screaming, "Come and see. He's the one finally. Are you sure?" While he was still shouting, Job also said, "Hey, I know him. I know him. I experience him. I know him. Everyone, my friends, my friends, move away. This one is the one. Everyone had an experience with him over the ages. They saw him because grace had made the require. And finally, this is my favorite part. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
