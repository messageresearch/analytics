[0:01] And uh
[0:04] we're doing Romans chapter 3
[0:09] vers 23.
[0:14] I was supposed to preach this on on on
[0:16] Wednesday but I didn't go through
[0:17] through it all. So I thought I should
[0:18] just uh with everybody here just go
[0:21] through this again.
[0:28] So we are speaking on trophies of his
[0:30] grace.
[0:34] Uh no boasting.
[0:44] Okay, it's not one word but if you want
[0:45] to make it one sentence that's all
[0:47] right. But in brackets you can say no
[0:48] boasting
[0:50] verses. We are beginning from verses 23
[0:52] to 28.
[0:56] sixth chapter chapter 3 rather of
[0:58] Romans.
[1:03] Um vers 23.
[1:11] Are we all there? If you're there, say
[1:12] amen.
[1:17] Okay.
[1:18] Okay. We are going to read. Let us first
[1:20] pray.
[1:22] Loving Jesus, we ask your inspiration
[1:24] now as we go into your word.
[1:29] Let your spirit cover us.
[1:32] Fill us with your presence.
[1:35] And by the end of this service,
[1:39] we be sin. May you be sin and we
[1:43] disappear.
[1:45] Father Lord, I'm going to speak to your
[1:46] children,
[1:48] but I realize I'm not worthy, Lord.
[1:51] So come and take me out of the way and
[1:54] use these lips of mine to speak.
[1:58] Words of eternal life.
[2:00] Words which can change destiny.
[2:03] Words which can encourage them.
[2:07] Whatever it is that the enemy has
[2:08] desired to do in the people's life,
[2:13] bring us a deliverance by your word
[2:17] in Jesus name.
[2:20] Amen.
[2:20] For all have sinned and have come short
[2:22] of glor of the glory of God.
[2:25] Okay.
[2:30] being justified freely by his grace
[2:32] through the redemption that is in Christ
[2:34] Jesus,
[2:42] whom God has set forth to be a prop a
[2:45] propitiation through faith in in his
[2:48] blood to declare his righteousness for
[2:51] the remission of sins that are passed
[2:54] through the forbearance of God.
[3:09] [Music]
[3:11] to declare I say at this time his
[3:14] righteousness that he might be just and
[3:17] a justifier of him which believeth in
[3:19] Jesus.
[3:28] So where is boasting then
[3:31] is excluded?
[3:33] By what law?
[3:35] Of works? Nay, but by the law of faith.
[3:40] Therefore, we conclude that a man is
[3:43] justified by faith without the deeds of
[3:45] the law.
[4:03] So we have a lot of students back from
[4:05] school in
[4:09] so God bless you all. I won't mention
[4:11] names because I might I might leave out
[4:13] someone and they might say that I do not
[4:15] recognize them.
[4:18] But uh
[4:20] [Music]
[4:22] nice to be with you today
[4:25] and um it's our visitors who are
[4:27] visiting us. I saw sister Kajumba. I
[4:29] think you've come with your friend.
[4:34] God bless you. You're welcome.
[4:37] Uh we have here no law but love,
[4:41] no book but the Bible,
[4:44] no membership but fellowship.
[4:47] The blood of Jesus Christ washes us from
[4:48] all sin.
[4:51] Uh I forgot your name. Your name I
[4:54] remember the words but it's difficult to
[4:56] mention.
[4:59] I will not try it. I'll mess it up. But
[5:00] you're welcome. God bless you. He's
[5:03] another student from the aviation
[5:04] college
[5:08] and uh he's been I think he's Are you
[5:10] from South Africa?
[5:12] Yes.
[5:14] uh he's been in some of our meetings
[5:15] there.
[5:18] So they came uh with uh sister favor
[5:21] this morning.
[5:24] So this morning I'd like to speak on the
[5:26] subject I've told you of
[5:30] but I've already spoken about this here
[5:32] in church in in the previous services.
[5:37] So I hope that today I will hit notes
[5:38] that I did not hit
[5:42] and we will see what the Lord has for
[5:44] you this morning.
[5:47] So just in case you are new here and you
[5:49] don't know how we take things. I don't
[5:51] I'm not a very long preacher
[5:57] but some what is sure to us some to some
[6:00] it is very long.
[6:05] You know, we usually speak for about an
[6:06] hour and a half or so,
[6:10] but usually I do 1 hour.
[6:13] I pray that you just stay put and uh let
[6:15] us um together be bound together and see
[6:18] what the Holy Spirit will speak to us.
[6:24] Try to avoid movement as much as
[6:26] possible.
[6:29] Amen.
[6:31] So, I'm speaking on trophies this
[6:33] morning.
[6:36] We we saw what a trophy is.
[6:39] A trophy
[6:41] is um we defined it as a could be a gift
[6:50] for a victory or success.
[6:55] And then we also defined it in then in
[6:58] the ancient times the Greece uh the
[7:01] Greeks and the Romans
[7:06] when they would go to attack an army,
[7:09] [Music]
[7:11] you know, and then that army was
[7:12] defeated.
[7:15] So, as a re as a show of their victory,
[7:19] [Music]
[7:20] they would set up the things the ruins
[7:23] from the war.
[7:29] Whatever those people gave up because
[7:31] they were worn,
[7:36] it could be swords,
[7:38] shields,
[7:41] spears.
[7:43] Today you can say guns or grenades and
[7:45] things,
[7:47] spoils of war
[7:50] and especially those that they were
[7:52] using to fight them with.
[7:56] weapons.
[7:58] So they would take those weapons
[8:01] and they would array them in a place
[8:05] and and in that place
[8:08] they would uh uh use those weapons
[8:12] as a show and a remembrance
[8:17] a memorial of their victory.
[8:21] Well, that over there is a cut.
[8:26] You don't know it.
[8:28] Let it not distract your attention to
[8:30] the word.
[8:32] Amen. Amen.
[8:33] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[8:38] Brother Biscal was preaching one day
[8:42] in Canada
[8:43] and a cat came in the church.
[8:46] So walked through
[8:48] and then he told the people everybody
[8:51] started looking back.
[8:54] So he told them it's a cat
[8:57] and every one of them felt embarrassed
[9:00] that they left the word in preference
[9:02] for a cat.
[9:05] So the devil has a way of taking your
[9:06] attention from the word.
[9:10] But can we focus here church?
[9:14] So now you will take those memorials of
[9:16] victory
[9:20] over a defeated army
[9:22] and they would arrange it in a place
[9:26] and everybody would know
[9:28] that this army has defeated the other
[9:30] army.
[9:33] So those weapons
[9:35] would be called trophies.
[9:39] Trophies of victory.
[9:41] trophies that they have won that show
[9:43] that they have won the victory.
[9:47] Anybody that had such a trophy,
[9:51] it shows he's a victor.
[9:53] It shows he has he has won the battle.
[9:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the
[10:00] name of the Lord. And so we also notice
[10:04] that it could be a prize.
[10:09] Now, if we had two people here,
[10:13] I love demonstrating, but I will not
[10:14] demonstrate that to you.
[10:18] Picked up two people and we told them
[10:19] fight.
[10:22] The one who wins
[10:24] will get a gift of this man.
[10:28] Even a calm person,
[10:31] you will see them stretching themselves
[10:32] to fight.
[10:37] will hit you and you will beat him but
[10:39] after he has tried
[10:42] in order to get the trophy.
[10:44] So trophies are precious things
[10:48] but here when it comes to salvation
[10:52] there is one who fought the battle.
[10:54] So we spoke about the battle that we are
[10:56] fighting
[10:58] and this battle is not really ours.
[11:02] The battle we are fighting on earth,
[11:05] the battle of sin
[11:08] is started really in heaven.
[11:12] That's where Satan
[11:14] fought against God.
[11:17] Bible says Lucifer had his u his angels
[11:22] and also Michael had his angels
[11:26] and the the battle line was drawn.
[11:29] They started fighting and fold and fold.
[11:33] But that's Lucifer the dragon
[11:36] was defeated and he was cast down here
[11:39] on earth
[11:41] and all his angels
[11:43] today we call them demons
[11:45] and we call Lucifer Satan.
[11:49] But you know Jesus after winning that
[11:51] battle
[11:53] he did not have any trophy to show for
[11:55] it.
[11:58] So when he the devil came down, he
[12:01] thought he will come and destroy the
[12:03] creation of God.
[12:07] But you see, like I told you, God had a
[12:09] plan.
[12:10] God was looking for a trophy
[12:14] to show for his victory,
[12:17] whereby he can boast of grace,
[12:20] whereby he can boast of victory.
[12:23] Can I have more sound on my monitor? I
[12:25] just straight my voice.
[12:29] And so the devil came down in the garden
[12:32] and he defeated um he defeated Adam and
[12:34] Eve.
[12:37] And after they were defeated,
[12:41] the devil thought I have won.
[12:45] The victory. The devil for the first
[12:47] time sang a song.
[12:50] Victory is mine.
[12:53] Victory is mine. Victory today.
[12:58] I tell God
[13:03] today
[13:05] I have won the victory. Victory today
[13:11] dominion is mine. Power is mine. And
[13:15] when Jesus came down on earth,
[13:18] Jesus reminded the devil reminded
[13:20] Satans. The devil reminded Jesus.
[13:24] You remember you see all the earth and
[13:28] the fullness thereof.
[13:30] It is mine
[13:32] and I give it to whoever I desire.
[13:35] So bow down and worship him and I'll
[13:38] give it all to you. He knew he thought
[13:41] it was his.
[13:44] But the one he was speaking to
[13:47] was the one who had come to possess it
[13:49] back.
[13:51] And I say he possesses it back.
[13:54] He would be able to arrange trophies
[13:59] of his victory.
[14:01] But there's one thing he would use
[14:05] to possess back everything the devil
[14:07] stole.
[14:09] That thing is called grace.
[14:13] He came with one commodity
[14:17] called grace.
[14:19] Can you imagine God defeating the devil
[14:22] using grace?
[14:26] because the devil knew what God said in
[14:29] his word.
[14:32] The soul that sins
[14:34] [Music]
[14:35] that soul shall
[14:37] die.
[14:38] So the devil knew under no circumstance
[14:43] will God forgive Adam?
[14:46] Will God forgive Eve?
[14:49] Because they have sinned
[14:51] the way I sinned.
[14:53] when I was in heaven because I remember
[14:56] when I sinned
[14:58] and all my
[15:16] life
[15:18] Satan knew
[15:20] but his knowledge It sloped only,
[15:38] unmmerited favor,
[15:43] something you receive when you are not
[15:44] worthy of it.
[15:47] For Satan to think
[15:50] that God can take back Adam,
[15:55] it was impossible.
[15:57] But that is exactly what God had come to
[15:59] do.
[16:02] He had come to take back Adam
[16:06] on the basis of what Adam did. Right?
[16:14] Are you following me?
[16:16] He came to take back Adam
[16:18] because Adam was a good man.
[16:24] He came back to take Adam
[16:27] because Adam was very holy.
[16:31] Am I preaching to someone here?
[16:35] Was Adam a sinner?
[16:38] Had he fallen from God's grace?
[16:42] He had fallen from the first estate.
[16:46] There was nothing good on him.
[16:50] When God looked at him, everything in
[16:53] the written books
[16:55] was excluding him.
[16:58] As far as what he did,
[17:00] she was a sinner that that deserved
[17:04] death.
[17:06] But when God came down, he came to took
[17:09] back to take back Adam
[17:12] on the basis of God's grace.
[17:19] when Adam did not deserve it.
[17:23] And so God decided to take him back.
[17:26] And that was not all. After taking back
[17:29] Adam,
[17:30] of course, you cannot say he has taken
[17:32] back Adam and all his estate
[17:37] without defeating the enemy of Adam.
[17:42] I I'll take it a little bit slow here.
[17:44] This is where
[17:46] because this is the major point.
[17:47] Hear me now. Hear me. For Adam to come
[17:51] back in the good graces of God.
[17:57] He had to fight this battle of sin
[18:01] and overcome it.
[18:04] But the penalty of sin
[18:08] was death.
[18:10] And if you die a sinner,
[18:13] you are a sinner where you have gone.
[18:17] Death doesn't change a man.
[18:20] It only changes his dwelling place.
[18:23] So now if Adam was to die as a sinner,
[18:28] there was no more hope.
[18:31] It was done and the devil thought that
[18:34] is how it is going to be. So the devil
[18:37] knew Adam could never win this battle.
[18:42] So that's why the devil was so happy.
[18:46] He knew he had won. But when the devil
[18:50] thinks he has won,
[18:53] that is when God does come down.
[18:57] Let me tell you even in your life
[18:59] personally
[19:01] if you are a son of God if you're a
[19:04] daughter of God when the devil thinks he
[19:07] has won in your life
[19:11] that is the moment
[19:13] God is about to do something.
[19:17] Remember Samson? Remember this man here?
[19:20] What was his name? The Samson I believe
[19:22] it was
[19:24] Samson that moment
[19:27] when they had made him play sport for
[19:29] them.
[19:31] They had made him a display a trophy of
[19:34] the devil's victory
[19:39] and they were laughing all over the
[19:41] place.
[19:42] That is the moment where they had
[19:45] thought they have completely won him.
[19:49] God was fixing to do something.
[19:52] Why? Because the seed of God in a child
[19:55] of God does not die.
[19:59] Amen. You can do a lot of bad things in
[20:01] your flesh.
[20:03] The devil can use your mind
[20:06] to think evil things. And I tell you, if
[20:09] you're a seed jam of God,
[20:12] Amen. you can never completely perish
[20:14] away,
[20:17] you have to come out of the ground where
[20:20] the devil's buried you.
[20:23] I'm talking about the ground of sin.
[20:26] Amen. The tombs of sin, the tombs of
[20:29] immorality, the tombs of the desires of
[20:32] the flesh,
[20:34] the pride of life, and all that is in
[20:37] the world.
[20:38] The devil buried us there and he thought
[20:41] that we were completely defeated.
[20:44] But let me tell you what happens
[20:47] to a seed.
[20:49] When you plant a seed,
[20:51] a seed germinate.
[20:55] When the devil us
[20:58] know we were a seed
[21:01] and we cannot die
[21:03] to remain dead.
[21:06] When we die,
[21:07] We resurrect because we are sick. There
[21:12] is that seed jam of God in our soul.
[21:15] And the Bible says we cannot sin.
[21:20] Meaning we shall always believe
[21:23] when the word let me let me tell you
[21:25] this. When seed meets seed,
[21:29] the word of God is a seed.
[21:32] And in your soul there is also a seed.
[21:36] When seed meets seed.
[21:41] Hallelujah.
[21:42] Hallelujah. Because the seed comes in
[21:45] form of light
[21:48] and the seed in your soul
[21:51] needs the light
[21:54] and also the seed comes in form of the
[21:57] water.
[21:59] So the seed in your heart is both light
[22:03] and water.
[22:06] And now I can say the seed is shining on
[22:10] you.
[22:12] This word is shining on you when you
[22:14] were dead in your sin and your
[22:17] trespasses.
[22:19] Amen. He shined his great light
[22:24] and the devil could not hold you.
[22:27] Sin could not hold you.
[22:30] And some of you who are still in them,
[22:33] I am here as a servant of God
[22:36] give you a declaration.
[22:39] If you are a seed of God, you cannot be
[22:42] buried there for him.
[22:44] You have to come out.
[22:46] As long as you hear the right truth,
[22:50] the right word of the hour,
[22:53] it will quicken your soul
[22:56] and you will resurrect.
[22:58] Samson was almost gone.
[23:02] And at that moment when the devil
[23:04] thought he had won,
[23:07] God was fixing to do.
[23:10] God came down.
[23:12] You know, it only takes a seat to
[23:14] realize who they are.
[23:22] As long as Samson li down there,
[23:26] I was like, I'm defeated.
[23:28] Sincerely, last
[23:31] one. I think it will never go.
[23:35] It is very hard. It is very difficult.
[23:38] How can I even overcome it? I did not
[23:41] even go to church. I'm defeated.
[23:44] No, I'm a thief.
[23:46] And you think you are that?
[23:51] I'm a very bad person.
[23:54] I also know myself and I fear myself.
[23:58] How many of you fear yourselves?
[24:01] I fear myself. When I see my actions, I
[24:05] fear myself.
[24:08] I even wonder am I the one who has done
[24:10] it?
[24:11] When I feel the pastor preaching, I say
[24:14] my
[24:17] it is good pastor but me I fear myself.
[24:20] It seems these things cannot work on me.
[24:23] The pastor doesn't understand what he's
[24:25] saying. I know myself and I fear myself.
[24:28] That is how Samson works
[24:32] down there. But one morning when he rose
[24:36] up, he came to himself, he said, "No,
[24:39] I'm a son of God. I was born for a
[24:42] purpose. I'm here to defeat the
[24:44] Philistines.
[24:46] I'm here to cut off the heads of the
[24:47] Philistines.
[24:49] I'm here to defeat the devil. I am here
[24:52] for a purpose. I'm here to overcome
[24:54] lust. I'm here to overcome immorality.
[24:58] I'm here to overcome the pride of life.
[25:00] I am here to live as a son and as a
[25:03] daughter of God. I am not a trophy.
[25:06] I am not a trophy of the devil's
[25:08] victory.
[25:11] I am a trophy of God's victory.
[25:15] I am a trophy of grace. I don't deserve
[25:19] it. I know that this woman has taken me
[25:24] away
[25:26] from God. I I don't deserve
[25:30] the love of God that I know that is
[25:32] grace
[25:34] and I want to say it has come to my
[25:37] senses
[25:38] I am a trophy of God's grace the moment
[25:43] you come to that moment
[25:46] the devil thinks he has won the moment
[25:48] you know who you are
[25:50] that is the moment the devil will
[25:53] realize
[25:55] who is a champion
[25:58] hallelujah Amen.
[26:00] Amen.
[26:00] The devil will realize
[26:03] that Jesus Christ is a champion in your
[26:06] life.
[26:08] Hallelujah.
[26:08] Hallelujah.
[26:09] I tell you what, we are we are we are
[26:12] trophies of his grace.
[26:15] Tell two people you are trophy of his
[26:17] grace.
[26:20] At that moment,
[26:22] oh listen, don't you worry about the
[26:24] excitement.
[26:25] If it doesn't happen, I can't preach.
[26:30] If the word doesn't do that,
[26:33] then I don't know what the word can do.
[26:37] If the word makes people run crazy,
[26:40] it's a proof it can make sinners get
[26:42] sick.
[26:46] Are you hearing me? Hallelujah. Amen.
[26:50] What makes us running crazy is not
[26:52] football.
[26:54] It is the word.
[26:57] What makes us run crazy
[26:59] is not football. It is the word.
[27:04] Hallelujah. We are trophies of his
[27:06] grace. I said we are trophies of his
[27:09] grace. Samson at that moment. He
[27:13] realized now I know who I am. And the
[27:18] devil is not going to play around with
[27:20] me. The devil is not going to make me
[27:23] feel I am what I know I am not.
[27:32] And at that moment, he called a little
[27:34] boy. He said, "Come on, little boy. Show
[27:38] me the pillars.
[27:40] I was born. He killed a filister.
[27:44] If I have to die, I am going to die
[27:49] right in my purpose.
[27:53] Paul said, "For me to live is Christ.
[27:58] To die is gain."
[28:01] If you're going to live,
[28:03] live for Jesus.
[28:05] If you're going to die, die for Jesus.
[28:10] Die for a right cause.
[28:14] Die for a right purpose.
[28:17] why you were born.
[28:19] And Samson at that moment
[28:22] he he went and pulled up the he got his
[28:24] hands on the on the Peters
[28:27] and he began pulling they began laughing
[28:30] at him
[28:32] or else they if they knew.
[28:35] If only they had known
[28:38] they would have taken him from those
[28:39] spirits.
[28:42] Hallelujah.
[28:44] If only the devil had known.
[28:47] he would have taken me away from the
[28:49] word.
[28:51] But now that the devil
[28:54] did not hinder me from hearing the word,
[28:58] he did the biggest mistake ever.
[29:03] The biggest mistake
[29:06] is for the devil to let you hear the
[29:08] word.
[29:10] Because when you hear the word, the word
[29:13] must accomplish.
[29:16] the purpose why it is sent.
[29:20] [Applause]
[29:25] That is the biggest mistake the devil
[29:26] has made
[29:29] to let you come here. Amen.
[29:33] That is the only mistake.
[29:35] That is why he fought so much that he
[29:38] don't come under the word.
[29:41] But even tonight, he has fought you not
[29:42] to come to church. But because you're
[29:45] here, he has allowed you to come. That
[29:49] is the mistake he has made. As long as
[29:51] you are here,
[29:53] you the word must bring forth
[29:56] that nature of Christ out.
[30:01] Samson began pulling.
[30:03] It may take a while, but it must happen.
[30:09] Hallelujah.
[30:10] Started pushing.
[30:12] pulling on that pillar
[30:15] and in a moment
[30:17] everything started breaking away.
[30:22] Where there is God
[30:25] where there is grace
[30:27] where there is God there must be a
[30:30] shaking.
[30:35] I will show you that in a moment.
[30:38] And so here the scripture clearly now
[30:41] tells us
[30:43] that God
[30:45] has justified us
[30:47] freely by his grace
[30:50] through the redemption
[30:53] that is in Christ Jesus.
[30:55] So the the devil thought we are going to
[30:58] fight him.
[31:00] He did not know that was not the design.
[31:07] You have to help me to preach this to
[31:08] you.
[31:12] It's like I'm walking on water right
[31:13] now.
[31:15] The anointing of the world that is upon
[31:17] me right now.
[31:19] Listen.
[31:21] Listen carefully.
[31:23] The devil thought
[31:26] that we are going to fight him.
[31:29] Have you ever thought about that
[31:30] scenario whereby your enemy thinks
[31:32] you're going to fight him?
[31:35] Especially
[31:37] these children who are bullied at
[31:39] school.
[31:43] And then your bully waits for you.
[31:47] And then he thinks you're going to fight
[31:48] him.
[31:50] And then you plan on a day.
[31:55] Let us meet here. Let us fight. And then
[31:58] on that day, you go to meet there and
[32:02] your enemy prepares. Your bully
[32:04] prepares.
[32:06] This one I'll just eat him with one
[32:07] finger
[32:09] and before they know it, your big
[32:11] brother is the one showing up.
[32:14] [Music]
[32:17] It will be the worst day for your enemy.
[32:21] Your brother will beat him until all the
[32:23] teeth is out.
[32:27] That is exactly what happened.
[32:31] Jesus is our big brother.
[32:34] The Bible says he is the beginning of
[32:37] the creation of God
[32:41] and we are sons
[32:43] like him.
[32:46] Are you following me?
[32:48] Are you following me sisters?
[32:50] We are sons like Jesus was a son.
[32:57] And when he came down in the ring
[33:01] of sin,
[33:03] who was our enemy?
[33:05] Satan.
[33:07] What were we fighting?
[33:09] Sin. Who was supposed to fight?
[33:13] Me versus Satan.
[33:16] And the devil came in the ring fast.
[33:20] He waited for me to jump in,
[33:22] but I did not.
[33:24] Grace took over.
[33:27] Hallelujah.
[33:28] Someone else,
[33:30] my brother, my big brother,
[33:34] we have the same DNA.
[33:38] He came in the ring for me.
[33:41] He took my place.
[33:44] The Bible says that he took he become
[33:47] sin
[33:48] that we Oh, hallelujah.
[33:50] Hallelujah. we might become the
[33:52] righteousness of God.
[33:55] He became sin.
[33:59] He took the place
[34:01] that I was supposed to take in that ring
[34:04] game.
[34:06] He jumped in. When did he do that? When
[34:10] he was on the cross,
[34:14] when he went to that place,
[34:16] he took my place
[34:19] and the devil in this other man was
[34:23] speaking to him,
[34:25] bullying him.
[34:27] Save yourself and save us.
[34:30] If they say you are who you are,
[34:33] he didn't have to do anything or to say
[34:35] anything to him.
[34:38] He did not come to speak.
[34:41] When someone is a good fighter,
[34:44] he doesn't talk much.
[34:47] Empty tins make noise.
[34:51] But when Jesus came, he didn't come to
[34:54] make noise. He came.
[34:58] He came to do something.
[35:02] That is why for me to be saved. I don't
[35:05] have to do anything.
[35:11] Some of you didn't get that, did you?
[35:14] He came to do something
[35:19] that I may be a beneficiary
[35:24] of his action.
[35:28] And when he came and he he was killed
[35:31] there,
[35:32] he was beaten. He was pierced on the
[35:35] side. All those were actions
[35:40] that were bing me.
[35:45] Where did the wife of Adam come from?
[35:49] From the rib,
[35:51] the side of Adam.
[35:54] As much as he's our brother,
[35:57] he's also our husband.
[36:00] Speaking of Jesus Christ,
[36:04] When they pierced his side,
[36:06] there came out blood and water.
[36:10] What was that?
[36:13] We are saved by blood and water.
[36:18] The blood and the water is his word.
[36:22] When it came out
[36:25] that bust another Eve,
[36:30] another woman.
[36:32] The first Eve fell,
[36:35] but the second Eve
[36:37] will never fall.
[36:40] Hallelujah.
[36:44] The things I'm speaking to you this
[36:46] morning,
[36:48] I'm receiving it direct from him. And I
[36:51] want you to hear carefully.
[36:53] The second Eve
[36:55] cannot fall.
[36:57] Why? She's mad
[37:01] not of the flesh,
[37:04] but of the spirit.
[37:08] The life that went out of him
[37:11] through his blood and water
[37:15] was applied upon us
[37:18] and it is called grace.
[37:22] whereby you do not deserve it.
[37:25] You are a sinner.
[37:28] But here comes somebody and he comes
[37:30] into the ring and he hits the devil. He
[37:34] gave him one knock out.
[37:36] One knock out
[37:39] and Satan passed out.
[37:46] The prophet says
[37:50] Satan
[37:53] has no stinger.
[37:56] You know like a bee
[37:59] a bee can only bite you or or or how do
[38:01] they call it? Stingy once
[38:05] after that
[38:08] death.
[38:11] So the sting remains in you.
[38:17] Jesus on the cross
[38:19] was stung by Satan
[38:22] and that stinger remained in him.
[38:26] And Satan is a blast.
[38:30] He has no power
[38:32] to take anyone to hell.
[38:35] He has no victory.
[38:37] But because Jesus
[38:40] was more than a man
[38:43] when he died, certain thought, I have
[38:46] finished here. I hit him on the cross
[38:49] real good.
[38:51] He's going to die. But before the devil
[38:54] knew it, the same Jesus showed up in
[38:58] hell.
[39:02] He showed up in hell. And when he showed
[39:05] up in here, he came there to make sure
[39:10] he enforces the victory.
[39:15] He is not only a redeemer.
[39:18] He's also our kinsman enforcer.
[39:23] To enforce everything the word has said.
[39:28] Are you hearing me now? To enforce every
[39:30] promise.
[39:32] And when he went down to hell, he gave
[39:35] him another knock cut blow.
[39:39] You know, brother Bham dramatizes that.
[39:42] And he says when he went to hell,
[39:45] he knocked the gate of hell.
[39:48] And Lucifer was surprised.
[39:51] He said, but who is that?
[39:54] Everyone is here. So he did a roll call
[39:57] of all the demons in hell.
[40:00] All of them were present.
[40:03] Demon of lust
[40:06] present.
[40:07] Fornication
[40:09] present. Adultery present.
[40:13] What about the demons of lies? Present.
[40:17] Murder.
[40:20] Envy present. Witchcraft.
[40:24] [Music]
[40:27] Rumor mongering
[40:29] present. All the demons were there.
[40:33] So the devil was surprised.
[40:36] Which other demon is this one? This was
[40:39] not a demon.
[40:42] This was the creator of all.
[40:45] He that was on the ring. He that was on
[40:48] the cross
[40:50] come down. Oh. Hallelujah. If you love
[40:54] watching those kind of the kickboxing
[40:56] games,
[41:00] you know, brother Bam was a he like
[41:02] kickboxing.
[41:06] And so if you watch those games
[41:08] sometimes,
[41:09] there are these people who are so
[41:10] ruthless.
[41:13] They will kick you, box you, box you in
[41:18] the ring.
[41:20] And when they will box you and sometimes
[41:22] they throw you out of the ring.
[41:25] They follow you there.
[41:32] They play in the game and out of the
[41:33] game.
[41:37] When it comes to Satan,
[41:39] Jesus is ruthless.
[41:45] He's ruthless.
[41:47] He knew what he was doing.
[41:50] He kicked him on the cross
[41:52] in the ring and he followed him even to
[41:56] hell. And when he reached there,
[42:00] knocking on the gates of hell,
[42:03] where do you get these things from where
[42:05] the Bible says he was in in in hell in
[42:07] prison?
[42:09] When he died, where do you think Jesus
[42:10] was?
[42:12] He was right there in hell and he
[42:15] knocked on the doors and the door swung
[42:18] the the devil was like there behind the
[42:20] door, you know, uh shaking
[42:24] and Jesus banged the door and he swung
[42:27] open
[42:29] and the devil was almost wetting his
[42:31] pants
[42:35] if at all he had any.
[42:39] and right there.
[42:43] So, you are the one. Jesus said, "Yes,
[42:45] I'm the one."
[42:47] What did he mean?
[42:48] In the book of Genesis, the Bible says,
[42:51] "The seed of the serpent
[42:54] will breathe the heel of the seed of the
[42:56] woman,
[42:59] the heel. And the seed of the s of the
[43:02] woman
[43:04] will breathe the s. the seed of the serp
[43:08] the serpent.
[43:11] Jesus in prophecy was the seed of the
[43:15] woman.
[43:19] Meaning
[43:21] a a child born
[43:24] by a woman without a man.
[43:29] Jesus was born by Mary
[43:33] without the help of Joseph.
[43:36] Jesus was not the seed of Joseph.
[43:39] He was the seed of God
[43:44] through the woman
[43:46] only. And when he came down, he came to
[43:49] fulfill that prophecy.
[43:51] And right there in hell, you saw you are
[43:54] the one. Say, "Yes, I'm the one."
[43:57] I thought when I killed Moses, I had
[43:59] you.
[44:01] I thought when I killed Adam, I had
[44:05] I feel when I killed all the prophets, I
[44:07] had you.
[44:09] I I thought when I had so and so, I had
[44:11] you.
[44:13] I thought when I I finished Job, I had
[44:15] you.
[44:18] All of the prophets
[44:21] did not come to the glory of God.
[44:26] They died
[44:28] having not attained.
[44:30] So the devil thought he had him.
[44:34] that one promised
[44:36] when he killed all the others.
[44:40] But Jesus said,
[44:42] wait a moment. Remember that when Jesus
[44:46] was on earth,
[44:49] the devil saw him
[44:51] and he wondered whether he was the sea
[44:56] or not. So many times he would ask him
[45:00] especially one time he asked him
[45:03] if you are the son of God
[45:05] do this
[45:07] if you are the son. So he was not too
[45:09] sure
[45:11] could he be the one or because if he's
[45:13] the one my kingdom is going to fall
[45:17] so I have to make sure I finish him.
[45:21] This is was a battle going on. What am I
[45:23] trying to do? I'm trying to show you the
[45:27] real battle
[45:29] has already happened.
[45:31] You don't have to fight no nothing.
[45:36] You are a trophy.
[45:42] So Lucifer Lucifer was trying to wonder
[45:45] whether he was the one
[45:48] and fully he got to learn
[45:52] maybe is the one. So I have to finish
[45:54] him. So he finished him on the cross.
[45:57] But that was the biggest mistake he did
[46:01] because after that Jesus followed him
[46:04] right there.
[46:06] And when Jesus arrived in hell,
[46:09] he did not go for negotiations.
[46:13] Sister peace, Jesus does not negotiate
[46:16] with terrorists.
[46:20] Satan is a terrorist.
[46:23] How many of you here have been
[46:25] terrorized by the devil
[46:28] in your private lives?
[46:31] He terrorizes your mind.
[46:34] Some people even get depression.
[46:38] Some people feel like, "Oh, I want to
[46:40] die."
[46:42] In this generation, the devil is
[46:44] terrorizing people's minds.
[46:49] Oh, the devil is a terrorist.
[46:52] And I'm here to announce to you
[46:54] Jesus
[46:56] does not
[46:58] negotiate with terrorists
[47:03] right there in hell.
[47:06] He did not negotiate with the devil. He
[47:08] said, "Are you the one?
[47:10] Please, can we have an understanding?
[47:14] Can we discuss if there is nothing to
[47:17] talk about? Give me the keys. He kicked
[47:21] him. He gave him a knock. And he took
[47:24] the keys.
[47:26] The keys of hell
[47:28] of death, of the grave. Satan has no
[47:32] authority.
[47:35] The keys of salvation.
[47:38] Jesus gave them to Peter when he was 12.
[47:41] So tell me, which keys does the
[47:43] Southern?
[47:45] He has no keys on your life.
[47:49] I'm angry with the devil today.
[47:53] And I'm here to tell you, church,
[47:55] because the devil did that,
[47:58] Jesus did not negotiate with him.
[48:01] He went to win.
[48:03] Jesus is here today
[48:05] to win in your life.
[48:08] Yes. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[48:11] He's here to win in my life.
[48:14] He cannot go through all this.
[48:17] Jesus cannot go through all this
[48:20] for nothing. He went through it. He
[48:24] suffered. He died. He fought with the
[48:27] devil in his mind. He fought and fought
[48:32] he struggled with him until finally.
[48:36] Hallelujah. He rose again.
[48:40] He rose from the grave.
[48:43] Why did he rise? It was a sign
[48:47] that he has defeated
[48:49] death,
[48:51] hell, the grave
[48:57] and all the power of darkness.
[49:01] [Music]
[49:03] Jesus
[49:05] has already defeated anything you are
[49:06] fighting.
[49:09] Whatever you are fighting,
[49:11] whatever your demons are,
[49:14] he fought it and over it
[49:19] and that's why he rose again.
[49:22] If this is not true,
[49:24] he should have not rose again.
[49:28] Everybody was waiting.
[49:31] Will he come out? Will he come out? The
[49:35] Romans, they even sent men to God.
[49:39] the
[49:41] guarding arrived.
[49:43] The Bible says there came a mighty
[49:46] light.
[49:48] Oh, glory to God.
[49:52] And the stone
[49:54] with a seal there.
[49:59] They broke open
[50:01] and the stone was rolled away
[50:05] by a great mighty angel.
[50:10] There came out light.
[50:17] Hallelujah.
[50:18] Oh, this is a very emotional moment.
[50:23] And at that moment,
[50:26] the King of Kings,
[50:28] the Lord of Lords,
[50:30] the Master,
[50:32] the Victor,
[50:34] the mighty in battle,
[50:37] the Lord of hosts. I say, he stepped out
[50:41] in his glory.
[50:43] He stepped out. He stepped out.
[50:48] I'm here to announce to you
[50:50] Jesus rose again
[50:53] from the grave. There is no grave can
[50:56] hide any of those that believe in Jesus.
[51:02] No grave of sin,
[51:06] no grave of pornography. You young men,
[51:09] no grave of immorality
[51:12] can hold you anymore.
[51:15] When the light of the word shines,
[51:19] hallelujah.
[51:20] Hallelujah.
[51:21] You must come out of grace.
[51:25] Hear me.
[51:27] When Jesus rose,
[51:29] he has nothing to show for it.
[51:36] But
[51:38] what was the first place he went to?
[51:43] the room where his disciples work
[51:48] in fear.
[51:50] Why did he go there?
[51:52] That's the reason why he died and rose.
[51:58] The disciples
[52:00] I'm a disciple.
[52:03] You can say that too. I'm a disciple.
[52:07] I'm a disciple.
[52:10] I am a follower of Jesus.
[52:12] I am the reason.
[52:14] I am the reason.
[52:17] The only thing the devil that that Jesus
[52:19] has to show for
[52:22] his victory is me. I am the trophy.
[52:28] I am the trophy of his grace.
[52:32] What did I do? Nothing but the blood of
[52:36] Jesus.
[52:41] Hallelujah.
[52:42] Nothing but the blood.
[52:46] Not my works of righteousness.
[52:50] Some sometimes we think
[52:53] the things we do can make us attain
[52:55] salvation.
[52:58] And sometimes we think that what we do
[53:01] doesn't matter.
[53:03] Because those thoughts
[53:06] prove you don't know what grace is.
[53:12] But grace
[53:14] will make you understand. It is not what
[53:16] you did.
[53:18] It is not what you are doing. It is not
[53:21] what you will do
[53:23] that can make him
[53:26] make you a trophy.
[53:29] It is what he did.
[53:33] And when you realize who you are,
[53:36] you can't be the same anymore.
[53:40] They were in fear,
[53:42] shaking.
[53:44] Day he came.
[53:46] The day he came, he ate with them. He
[53:50] sapped with them. They saw him. Thomas
[53:54] said, "I want to be sure.
[53:56] I want to touch. Feel here." said here I
[54:00] am Thomas
[54:03] if you want to know him personally
[54:07] better than others
[54:09] in a deeper way you can
[54:14] you can he said Thomas it's all right
[54:18] you can touch me
[54:23] you are
[54:25] the one he revealed himself
[54:29] to the disciples
[54:31] and after this happened
[54:33] the the ones who were shaky the one who
[54:36] were fearful they began singing a
[54:38] different song
[54:40] I'm no longer
[54:43] fear
[54:46] [Music]
[54:49] from that moment they realized I am no
[54:52] longer a slave to sin
[54:58] I
[54:58] [Music]
[55:03] The things they used to do, they could
[55:06] do them no more. They could no longer
[55:08] shake, no longer fear. They no longer go
[55:11] back to that. They have had one
[55:13] commission
[55:15] to go and tell why
[55:18] near and far that Jesus rose again.
[55:25] There were trophies who had to be
[55:27] displayed.
[55:29] the life and the nature of Christ
[55:33] was supposed to be revealed through
[55:34] them.
[55:36] That's what grace is.
[55:40] Victory. He rose with victory.
[55:43] He rose with victory.
[55:46] The realization
[55:48] that he fought my battle.
[55:51] Praise the Lord. That that revelation
[55:56] is the only thing I need. Acts
[56:02] 16:23.
[56:06] If you can turn there with me.
[56:10] Praise the Lord.
[56:16] And when they had laid many stripes upon
[56:18] them, they cast them into prison,
[56:21] charging the jailer to keep them safely.
[56:23] Yeah, that's okay.
[56:31] These are the same people that met Jesus
[56:33] when he rose again.
[56:38] So when they had laid many stripes upon
[56:39] them, they caught them and they took
[56:40] them to jail. And so they had beaten
[56:42] them
[56:45] and they told the jailer, "Keep them
[56:46] safe."
[56:50] Who, having received such a charge,
[56:53] thrust them into the inner prison.
[56:59] and made their feet fast in the stalks.
[57:05] These people were cast not only in a
[57:07] prison
[57:09] but in the inner prison.
[57:13] Listen listen please listen carefully.
[57:16] These are not just stories.
[57:18] We are reading this for our example
[57:22] which means we are going through the
[57:23] same same thing.
[57:26] When the devil realizes who you are,
[57:29] his number one purpose
[57:31] is to cast you into a prison.
[57:34] Not just a prison, but an an inner
[57:35] prison
[57:37] in a prison.
[57:40] Let me tell you this.
[57:43] This this Saturn is already defeated,
[57:47] but is a bluff.
[57:49] It's just like those of you who have
[57:51] grown or who grew up in villages.
[57:55] You knew that if you are growing some
[57:56] crops,
[57:59] there are some animals who which come
[58:01] and eat them
[58:04] birds and others.
[58:06] So you make some kind of scarecrow
[58:09] that will hinder those birds to eat
[58:11] them.
[58:14] And so what happens?
[58:17] The birds come and fly away.
[58:20] Monkeys come and run away because they
[58:23] think that's a real person.
[58:25] That's what the devil has done to many
[58:27] of us
[58:29] from the m from the day of the cross.
[58:33] This is what the devil is doing,
[58:35] scaring us.
[58:38] He's a he's a scarecrow. He's a bluff.
[58:42] So here he's taking these disciples
[58:46] and he took them and cast them into
[58:47] prison.
[58:49] Not just a prison like everybody
[58:52] but an inner prison.
[58:54] When you when you come to the knowledge
[58:56] of grace
[58:58] and you accept Christ as your savior,
[59:01] you believe the message of
[59:03] that day, the devil will begin to fight
[59:06] you differently.
[59:08] You will realize you're fighting battles
[59:10] you had never fought before.
[59:14] You you realize it's harder now.
[59:17] And then sometimes you will wonder why
[59:19] do I have to suffer?
[59:21] Why do I struggle?
[59:23] Listen, you're just in a prison.
[59:26] The devil imprisons your mind.
[59:29] The devil imprisons your body
[59:32] and to make you think
[59:35] out of the contents the contents of the
[59:38] word
[59:41] to make you think you are not free.
[59:44] make you think that you cannot you know
[59:46] express yourself
[59:50] if you are in Christ. I've met people
[59:54] who have been in prison
[59:57] in deep prisons
[1:00:00] where even when they want to come out
[1:00:02] they feel they can't.
[1:00:06] And there is no prison
[1:00:09] like the prison of lust and sin.
[1:00:14] We even sing a song.
[1:00:17] Brother, if you can give us that song, I
[1:00:20] don't remember this, but it says if men
[1:00:22] today,
[1:00:25] oh my, let's quickly get that song. I I
[1:00:28] want to sing it.
[1:00:30] Brother, you have you know the title.
[1:00:32] Yeah. When Jesus comes
[1:00:34] quickly,
[1:00:36] give us that song. Let the people see
[1:00:37] these words.
[1:00:41] Hallelujah.
[1:00:42] Hallelujah.
[1:00:45] Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] Amen.
[1:00:48] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:00:50] Have you got the words, brother Marvin?
[1:00:51] If you have the words, it says when
[1:00:54] Jesus comes,
[1:00:56] the tempter's power is broken.
[1:01:00] When Jesus comes, the tears are wiped
[1:01:03] away.
[1:01:05] He takes the gloom
[1:01:07] and fills the life with glory.
[1:01:11] For all is changed
[1:01:14] when Jesus comes to stay.
[1:01:17] And then he says,
[1:01:20] there was one that sat alone
[1:01:24] beside on the highway. He was begging.
[1:01:28] His eyes were blind.
[1:01:31] The light he could not see.
[1:01:34] He clashed his rags
[1:01:38] and shivered in the shadows.
[1:01:41] Then Jesus came
[1:01:44] and he beg the darkness to flee
[1:01:47] from home and friends.
[1:01:50] The evil spirits drove him
[1:01:54] among the tombs
[1:01:56] and dwelt in misery.
[1:01:59] He cut himself
[1:02:01] as demon powers possessed him.
[1:02:05] Then Jesus came
[1:02:08] and he set the captives
[1:02:12] unclean uncle and clean.
[1:02:14] The leer cried in torment.
[1:02:17] The death, the dumb
[1:02:20] in helplessness,
[1:02:23] the fever raged
[1:02:26] disease and had gripped its victim.
[1:02:30] Then Jesus came and he cast out every
[1:02:34] fear.
[1:02:35] So men today,
[1:02:38] oh I love this one. Men today, they have
[1:02:42] found
[1:02:44] we have found.
[1:02:46] I have found
[1:02:48] the savior able.
[1:02:52] I could not conquer.
[1:02:55] Passion,
[1:02:57] passion,
[1:02:59] lust,
[1:03:01] sin,
[1:03:03] their broken hearts.
[1:03:06] My broken heart.
[1:03:09] Why are they broken?
[1:03:11] Because you want to conquer this.
[1:03:14] But there is nothing in you to conquer.
[1:03:17] and you in prison.
[1:03:21] They go to church and still in prison.
[1:03:24] They pray but still in prison.
[1:03:27] They read the Bible but still in prison.
[1:03:30] They preach but still in prison.
[1:03:32] Let me tell you, it knows no bounds.
[1:03:36] Prison. That's what the devil desires to
[1:03:40] take us and captivate us and put us in a
[1:03:42] prison.
[1:03:44] prison of passion, lust and fear.
[1:03:48] So they have broken hearts.
[1:03:51] They had left them sad and lonely.
[1:03:55] That's what the devil does. The moment
[1:03:58] he comes and begins to tempt you with
[1:04:00] these things
[1:04:02] and then you become a victim.
[1:04:05] The next thing is you become sad. You
[1:04:09] become lonely. There is one thing sin
[1:04:12] will do. Sin will always bring sad
[1:04:14] sadness and loneliness.
[1:04:18] And that's why the people that engage
[1:04:20] into these things,
[1:04:22] they often want to get some something to
[1:04:25] soothe their spirit.
[1:04:29] You know, they want to get some alcohol
[1:04:32] and be happy. The moment alcohol wears
[1:04:36] off
[1:04:37] then they are sad again
[1:04:40] to get some smoke. They want to get some
[1:04:43] weed or they want to get some you know
[1:04:46] marijuana whatever you call it
[1:04:48] you know so that they can soo theirirel
[1:04:52] and be happy. The moment it wears off
[1:04:55] they become sad again they become
[1:04:58] depressed. They become lonely. It is a
[1:05:01] prison.
[1:05:04] But here the song says,
[1:05:07] "Amen." It had left them sad and lonely.
[1:05:11] Some of those were asked,
[1:05:13] but these are the gamechanging words
[1:05:15] here. Then Jesus came.
[1:05:21] Tell two people. Then Jesus came. Then
[1:05:24] Jesus came. Then Jesus came.
[1:05:29] and he dwelt himself within.
[1:05:32] When Jesus comes,
[1:05:34] he comes to dwell inside.
[1:05:37] He comes to dwell in
[1:05:39] in my life,
[1:05:41] in my soul.
[1:05:42] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:05:44] Hallelujah.
[1:05:45] Hallelujah.
[1:05:49] Oh my God.
[1:05:50] So they were thrust into the inner
[1:05:52] prison
[1:05:54] and were made they made their feet fast
[1:05:56] in the stalks.
[1:06:00] So they were there prison prisoners,
[1:06:03] prisoners of sin in the sensei.
[1:06:08] But friend, don't you worry. You are not
[1:06:11] here to prove how powerful you are.
[1:06:15] You are here to prove how powerful your
[1:06:17] savior is.
[1:06:22] Hallelujah. All my life I've gone
[1:06:25] through things but everything I've gone
[1:06:27] through you know even as a young person
[1:06:30] I became saved at 13
[1:06:33] around
[1:06:35] as I grew up going through you know the
[1:06:38] you know the trials of life and
[1:06:41] I would always tell myself
[1:06:44] you can make it you are greater than you
[1:06:47] know
[1:06:49] I always ask myself what is that desire
[1:06:53] in my heart
[1:06:55] for holiness, for righteousness, for
[1:06:58] more of God.
[1:07:00] Hallelujah. Come on, brother Peter. What
[1:07:01] is that in me that was not my own
[1:07:07] abilities?
[1:07:10] It was something in me,
[1:07:13] desiring
[1:07:14] for something greater.
[1:07:17] You might be here today. It doesn't
[1:07:20] matter how you are.
[1:07:22] You don't need to be a hypocrite.
[1:07:26] I'm preaching this to tell you, you
[1:07:30] don't need to be a hypocrite.
[1:07:34] I don't need to be a pastor of
[1:07:35] hypocrites.
[1:07:38] Because hypocrite will not go to heaven.
[1:07:42] You don't need to be a hypocrite.
[1:07:45] You need to admit
[1:07:47] and say, "Lord, I'm struggling with
[1:07:48] this.
[1:07:50] I can't do it on my own. He knows you
[1:07:53] can't do it on your own.
[1:07:55] That's why he sent Jesus. That's why he
[1:07:58] sent this message on the earth.
[1:08:00] While God sent William Branham,
[1:08:03] the prophet of our generation,
[1:08:05] he didn't come to bring another
[1:08:07] religion.
[1:08:09] He came to bring a message which will
[1:08:11] take us back to our relationship
[1:08:15] with Jesus Christ. So when if you're
[1:08:18] struggling
[1:08:20] Come to that place
[1:08:22] where you know
[1:08:24] I know
[1:08:26] my redeemer.
[1:08:30] But the problem we have many Christians
[1:08:35] are hypocrites.
[1:08:37] How are you?
[1:08:39] I'm fine.
[1:08:42] But you know what you're
[1:08:43] [Music]
[1:08:47] a sinner.
[1:08:48] [Music]
[1:08:50] You know you need deliverance.
[1:08:53] You know you need to press further
[1:08:55] deeper in Christ.
[1:08:58] You know you need the Holy Spirit.
[1:09:01] But the devil makes you comfortable
[1:09:03] in your prison.
[1:09:06] Listen to me. Admit you in a prison.
[1:09:10] No you are in a prison. But also know
[1:09:15] you are not alone.
[1:09:17] Know that you have a redeemer.
[1:09:22] Know that you are a trophy
[1:09:25] of grace,
[1:09:26] not your works, grace. He that
[1:09:30] Hallelujah. He that fought a battle on
[1:09:32] the cross
[1:09:34] and won that battle can actually take
[1:09:37] you out of that prison
[1:09:41] without you having to do anything.
[1:09:47] So what must I do? Let us follow the
[1:09:50] scripture. So they had they were in an
[1:09:54] inner prison.
[1:09:56] And at midnight, Paul and Silas prayed.
[1:10:01] Point number one, pray.
[1:10:03] If you are hurting, pray.
[1:10:06] If you are confused, pray.
[1:10:09] Pray in every situation. If you are in
[1:10:12] temptation,
[1:10:14] pray. If you have sinned, pray. If you
[1:10:18] feel bad, pray. If you're depressed,
[1:10:21] pray. If your mind is losing it, pray.
[1:10:27] Pray sincerely.
[1:10:29] Pray with all your heart. Don't say
[1:10:32] prayers.
[1:10:34] Pray in the spirit.
[1:10:37] Pray in the spirit.
[1:10:39] Pray deeply.
[1:10:41] Enter into the revelations.
[1:10:43] I spoke about prayer last Friday. You
[1:10:46] can pray until visions begin to bust in
[1:10:49] your sight.
[1:10:52] You begin to see yourself a well man.
[1:10:55] You begin to see yourself delivered.
[1:10:58] You begin to see yourself above and
[1:10:59] beyond your problem.
[1:11:02] You begin to see yourself victorious.
[1:11:05] Then you begin to pray as a victorious
[1:11:08] man or woman. Prayer is a weapon.
[1:11:13] is the greatest weapon
[1:11:15] God has ever blessed in the human
[1:11:20] prayer. Paul and Silas,
[1:11:24] they prayed, they prayed
[1:11:27] and sang a praises.
[1:11:33] Hallelujah.
[1:11:34] If you pray and you hear the word and
[1:11:37] you don't sing praises,
[1:11:39] you will never be delivered.
[1:11:44] There was a man called Saul.
[1:11:47] He was a child of God. But evil spirits
[1:11:50] came onto
[1:11:51] repeatedly,
[1:11:53] spirits of depression
[1:11:55] and oppression.
[1:11:57] But the solution was they were supposed
[1:12:01] to find a man who was gifted
[1:12:07] to play
[1:12:09] a stringed instrument.
[1:12:12] And as he was playing,
[1:12:16] the demons will begin to live one by
[1:12:17] one.
[1:12:20] One by one. There is power. Power
[1:12:26] in the blood
[1:12:28] of the lamb. Let me tell you, there is
[1:12:30] something that praise does.
[1:12:35] Don't think it's about the dance.
[1:12:38] It's more than the dance.
[1:12:42] If you praise
[1:12:44] and you dance and you jump and you leap
[1:12:48] and you clap your hands,
[1:12:51] what is that? It's welcoming your
[1:12:54] victory.
[1:12:58] This is biblical.
[1:13:00] It's many places in the Bible.
[1:13:03] When the children of Israel came to take
[1:13:06] Jericho, God told them, "All you need to
[1:13:09] do
[1:13:12] is to shout and go around the general.
[1:13:16] Shout. Shouting.
[1:13:19] Shout and go around the walls of
[1:13:23] shout." What is shouting?
[1:13:28] The the reason the the the reason behind
[1:13:31] what you're doing
[1:13:35] As you shout, as you rejoice, as you
[1:13:38] dance, you do it not cannally but in the
[1:13:40] spirit.
[1:13:43] Victory comes back
[1:13:47] and God will take you out of your
[1:13:48] prison.
[1:13:51] Some people come in the church
[1:13:54] and they only hear when the preacher
[1:13:55] finishes, amen,
[1:13:58] they go.
[1:14:00] That's why it is difficult for you to
[1:14:01] come to your victory.
[1:14:05] Stay.
[1:14:07] Get into the praise. Get into the
[1:14:09] worship. Let the let the spirit of God
[1:14:11] so
[1:14:13] while you worship him and you praise
[1:14:15] him. You are being delivered. Spirits
[1:14:17] are leaving.
[1:14:19] The time I've seen in most of the
[1:14:22] services I've ever been in,
[1:14:25] people being delivered,
[1:14:27] it's either when the word is going on
[1:14:31] mostly after the word has been preached
[1:14:35] and the people are praising
[1:14:37] or worshiping God. That's when victory
[1:14:39] comes.
[1:14:42] So they were praying and singing praise
[1:14:47] unto God
[1:14:49] and the prisoners heard them
[1:14:53] and suddenly
[1:14:57] suddenly
[1:14:59] when God is going to show up
[1:15:02] he come and announce
[1:15:05] just do the right thing.
[1:15:08] He will show up suddenly
[1:15:10] in your situation.
[1:15:12] in your prison,
[1:15:14] he must show up. He must come and take
[1:15:17] you out of your prison.
[1:15:20] If you praise him and worship him the
[1:15:21] right way,
[1:15:24] even if your marriage is in shambles,
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:28] praise and worship him, pray, he will
[1:15:31] show up.
[1:15:35] Suddenly there was a great earthquake
[1:15:38] so that the foundations of the prison
[1:15:40] were sh
[1:15:45] It doesn't sound like quiet church
[1:15:52] that God came in quietness
[1:15:55] that nobody even heard him
[1:15:59] as we were in those religions
[1:16:02] sit and sat down we in God's house
[1:16:07] to do this and that shout fall
[1:16:11] be stable.
[1:16:13] Even when you're praying, pray in your
[1:16:14] heart.
[1:16:16] That is what the religion says.
[1:16:19] But this is not what I see here
[1:16:22] when he came down suddenly.
[1:16:26] The Bible says the very the very
[1:16:28] foundations
[1:16:31] of the prison
[1:16:33] were shaken.
[1:16:35] Shaken.
[1:16:37] Imagine if there was a spirit on you.
[1:16:41] The Bible says the very foundations
[1:16:43] of that spirit
[1:16:46] begin to shake.
[1:16:49] That is why many times when people are
[1:16:52] being delivered from things
[1:16:54] many times you find them jumping up and
[1:16:57] falling
[1:16:59] many times. Yeah. Sometimes it's just an
[1:17:02] influence of the Holy Ghost
[1:17:05] and you know you're just someone is just
[1:17:07] drunk.
[1:17:08] But sometimes it is people being
[1:17:10] delivered from spirits.
[1:17:14] Spirit the Holy Spirit comes on you and
[1:17:17] it shakes the very foundations of that
[1:17:19] prison
[1:17:23] to the extent that you fall down
[1:17:26] without anyone touching you.
[1:17:29] What is that? The very foundations of
[1:17:32] the prison
[1:17:34] they were shaken
[1:17:36] and immediately
[1:17:38] all the doors were open
[1:17:41] and everyone was burned.
[1:17:49] Hallelujah.
[1:17:50] When the spirit of God came down, why
[1:17:53] did he come down? Because there was a
[1:17:56] trophy there.
[1:18:01] Hallelujah.
[1:18:03] If this is yours, brother.
[1:18:07] Hallelujah.
[1:18:08] The Bible on your phone
[1:18:11] and someone takes it from you
[1:18:15] and gives it to another.
[1:18:17] What do you do, brother? You just sit
[1:18:20] and leave it there.
[1:18:23] What do you do? Tell us or show us what
[1:18:26] you should do.
[1:18:28] Come on now. Or else your phone is gone
[1:18:31] forever.
[1:18:34] Give me my Bible. The Bible is mine.
[1:18:36] The phone is not mine.
[1:18:44] The devil takes what belongs to you
[1:18:47] and takes it away from you. Do you just
[1:18:50] sit and relax?
[1:18:52] So show us what you do then.
[1:18:56] Come on.
[1:19:02] God bless you. That's what you do. You
[1:19:05] pos, you repossess what belongs to you.
[1:19:09] It is yours.
[1:19:11] The moment you receive the Holy Spirit.
[1:19:15] You are no longer of your own.
[1:19:17] You are his.
[1:19:20] You are his trophy.
[1:19:22] You are the proof of his victory.
[1:19:25] You are the proof of his grace.
[1:19:28] He cannot sit there.
[1:19:31] He cannot sit there
[1:19:33] and watch the devil taking you away from
[1:19:36] him.
[1:19:38] He comes to enforce
[1:19:41] his victory.
[1:19:45] And when it what why does he do that?
[1:19:48] The prison
[1:19:50] shook the very foundation.
[1:19:53] Then he came down. Why did he come down?
[1:19:57] Because Paul and Silas were in there.
[1:20:01] Why will Jesus come to you?
[1:20:04] Oh my. Now I'm prophesying to you now.
[1:20:08] Why will Jesus come to you?
[1:20:11] Because you are his.
[1:20:13] The devil has no right and authority.
[1:20:17] He has no power over your body, over
[1:20:20] your soul, over your life. whatever
[1:20:24] prison
[1:20:25] that the devil has taken you in, he will
[1:20:28] come down and shed the very foundation
[1:20:33] and take you out of there.
[1:20:37] Hallelujah. That's why I can say
[1:20:40] by authority
[1:20:42] because I know it every one of you that
[1:20:46] are a seed of God, you must be able to
[1:20:50] come to perfection.
[1:20:54] The devil cannot stop it.
[1:20:57] He cannot hinder.
[1:21:00] Why? Because grace
[1:21:03] called us out of the world. Grace
[1:21:06] redeemed us. Grace delivered us.
[1:21:11] Don't you worry. If there is any spirit
[1:21:14] on your life
[1:21:16] trying to control your life, grace is
[1:21:20] coming down to res you out of your
[1:21:24] prison,
[1:21:26] take you out.
[1:21:28] It must happen.
[1:21:31] I said it must happen.
[1:21:34] Nothing can stop it.
[1:21:37] Nothing can stop it.
[1:21:40] I always told myself
[1:21:42] As I was growing up, nothing can hinder
[1:21:46] me from getting married. Nothing can
[1:21:49] hinder me even from living these worldly
[1:21:53] things. Nothing can hinder me from being
[1:21:56] a preacher. Nothing can hinder me from
[1:21:59] serving God all my life. Nothing can
[1:22:02] hinder me.
[1:22:03] Not poverty, not lust, not the desires
[1:22:07] of the things of the world.
[1:22:12] Why? Because I am a trophy.
[1:22:15] I am a trophy of his grace. If you are
[1:22:19] comfortable
[1:22:21] in your prison, suit yourself. But as
[1:22:25] far as I'm concerned, I am not
[1:22:27] comfortable
[1:22:29] in any prison that the devil has put me
[1:22:32] in.
[1:22:34] And I'm going to come out. Paul and
[1:22:37] Silas were there. When the angel of the
[1:22:39] Lord came down, he redeemed them out of
[1:22:42] there. The Bible says the doors were
[1:22:44] open.
[1:22:46] The chains which had bound them, they
[1:22:49] opened up on their own. They fell off.
[1:22:54] What was that? The power of God.
[1:22:59] The power of grace.
[1:23:02] Hallelujah.
[1:23:04] They did nothing.
[1:23:06] He did everything.
[1:23:09] What they did was to recognize his
[1:23:12] presence.
[1:23:15] Keep serving God.
[1:23:18] Your body will submit.
[1:23:22] Keep serving God.
[1:23:24] Your spirit must submit.
[1:23:27] Keep coming to church. Keep hearing the
[1:23:30] word. Keep reading the word.
[1:23:33] Your body must submit.
[1:23:36] We must come to subjection
[1:23:39] of the power of God
[1:23:41] and then the prison.
[1:23:44] Let me just finish up these verses.
[1:23:48] I think I'm going to continue with this
[1:23:49] subject on Sunday because my time is up
[1:23:51] and I want to continue.
[1:23:54] Just a few more verses here.
[1:23:56] And suddenly there was a great
[1:23:57] earthquake.
[1:24:00] So that the foundations of the prison
[1:24:01] were shaken
[1:24:03] and immediately all the doors were
[1:24:04] opened
[1:24:06] and everyone whose bands were loosed.
[1:24:10] Everyone
[1:24:13] everyone
[1:24:16] his bands were loosed.
[1:24:21] Oh my God.
[1:24:23] Praise God.
[1:24:26] When Jesus comes,
[1:24:29] the tempter's power is born.
[1:24:33] When he came at the tomb of Lazarus,
[1:24:36] he called Lazarus by name.
[1:24:41] And Lazarus came out
[1:24:44] and Jesus said,
[1:24:47] "Lose him
[1:24:50] and let him go." That's the reason why
[1:24:52] Jesus came on us to lose us from the
[1:24:55] bands of sleep.
[1:24:58] And the keeper of the prison awake
[1:25:00] awaking out of his sleep
[1:25:04] and seeing the prison door was open.
[1:25:07] He drew out his sword
[1:25:10] and he would have killed himself.
[1:25:12] Supposing the prisoners had been fled.
[1:25:16] But Paul cried with a loud voice,
[1:25:18] saying,
[1:25:20] "Do thyself no harm,
[1:25:22] for we are all here."
[1:25:25] Then he called for a light
[1:25:29] and sprang in and came trembling
[1:25:33] and fell down before Paul.
[1:25:36] [Music]
[1:25:40] If the devil has been chaining you
[1:25:44] and using some of these people to chain
[1:25:46] you
[1:25:48] in sin,
[1:25:50] here's what is going to happen.
[1:25:53] God is going to deliver you.
[1:25:56] That is sure.
[1:25:59] Those people that the devil was using,
[1:26:02] they will either disappear
[1:26:04] or be saved.
[1:26:08] And here this prison guard
[1:26:10] As he falls down at Paul and feet,
[1:26:14] he asked a question,
[1:26:16] a million dollar question.
[1:26:19] Sir,
[1:26:21] what must I do?
[1:26:26] [Music]
[1:26:29] And they said,
[1:26:32] first of all, come and register on the
[1:26:35] church book.
[1:26:39] You have to dress this way.
[1:26:42] You have to talk this way.
[1:26:45] Uh also you have to do this and that.
[1:26:49] And um when you you get done with that,
[1:26:53] then we shall baptize you.
[1:26:56] After we baptize you,
[1:26:58] the pastor will meet you.
[1:27:01] After that you will come and talk to the
[1:27:04] church
[1:27:06] confess your sins.
[1:27:08] after that.
[1:27:12] Oh, did I tell them
[1:27:15] that? Oh, no, you need to do
[1:27:18] confirmance.
[1:27:27] Or maybe did he they tell him,
[1:27:30] you know, you have to do penitence.
[1:27:35] [Music]
[1:27:37] You have to tell come to tell the holy
[1:27:39] father everything you have done since
[1:27:40] you were a child.
[1:27:45] Father I have sinned.
[1:27:50] Come on now.
[1:27:52] Did I have to do that?
[1:27:56] Oh. Oh. You have to pray three times a
[1:27:58] day
[1:28:00] and you have to do
[1:28:05] Are you hearing me now?
[1:28:07] Religions
[1:28:09] have reduced Jesus Christ
[1:28:13] to to do least.
[1:28:20] If you go to the Adventists,
[1:28:23] don't eat pork.
[1:28:28] If you eat pork, you'll go to hell.
[1:28:34] As long as you don't eat it, you you
[1:28:36] will
[1:28:39] then you go. Every religion will tell.
[1:28:44] Thank God.
[1:28:46] He has called us out all.
[1:28:51] We are not part of any religious system.
[1:28:55] We are not a religion.
[1:28:59] In this fellowship,
[1:29:01] we are not a religion.
[1:29:04] Are you hearing me? Let me emphasize it.
[1:29:08] We came out of religion.
[1:29:10] I can prove that right now.
[1:29:13] How many here came from Catholic?
[1:29:15] Catholics. Raise up your hand.
[1:29:19] Raise up high. High.
[1:29:22] How many came from Anglicans?
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:26] No, no, Let let me change. Let me
[1:29:27] change. How many Anglicans? Because now
[1:29:29] they may feel that I am refusing them.
[1:29:32] How many Anglicans? Raise up your hand.
[1:29:35] Mine is up. Mine is up.
[1:29:38] Uhhuh.
[1:29:39] How many uh came from Islam?
[1:29:43] Raise up your hand.
[1:29:46] How many came from Adventist?
[1:29:50] How many came from uh uh uh um what
[1:29:53] else?
[1:29:54] Pentecostals.
[1:29:57] right there. Okay. Uh, the rest of you
[1:30:01] came from where?
[1:30:05] How many came from witchcraft? Raise up
[1:30:06] your hand.
[1:30:15] How many were Jehovah witnesses?
[1:30:24] All those religions
[1:30:26] we came out of them. This fellowship
[1:30:30] is a combination of all religions.
[1:30:34] We don't separate or divide any religion
[1:30:38] because religion is not our goal.
[1:30:43] This word is not about religion.
[1:30:46] It's about the grace of Jesus.
[1:30:49] That's all. Anyone is welcome to finish.
[1:30:54] We are only drunk
[1:30:57] with the word
[1:30:59] and the Holy Spirit.
[1:31:01] We love the word. Anything away from the
[1:31:04] word is not the word.
[1:31:07] What we do, what we want to do, what we
[1:31:10] endeavor to do is what the word tells
[1:31:13] us. And the only goal we have
[1:31:17] is the rapture, the coming of the Lord.
[1:31:20] Anything is else is secondary.
[1:31:24] So now listen to me. Does it mean the
[1:31:27] religions are bad?
[1:31:29] Well, I'll ask you, is it bad for you to
[1:31:31] take a shower?
[1:31:35] [Music]
[1:31:37] You do it. You don't do it. You are a
[1:31:38] human being.
[1:31:40] [Music]
[1:31:41] But while you should take a shower, it
[1:31:43] is recommended.
[1:31:45] It is recommended you be a part of a
[1:31:47] religion.
[1:31:50] It is recommended you be a part of it.
[1:31:52] They will they will teach you culture.
[1:31:54] They will teach you behaviors. They will
[1:31:55] teach you how to be a good man, how to
[1:31:57] be
[1:31:58] but it will not take you to heaven.
[1:32:03] God in every age sends a message which
[1:32:07] will prepare his people to go to heaven
[1:32:11] and that message will be according to
[1:32:14] the Bible.
[1:32:16] And we among those people.
[1:32:19] that have been called to prepare
[1:32:22] ourselves
[1:32:23] to go to heaven and I say praise God for
[1:32:26] that. We are not the only ones. There
[1:32:30] are many others like us. They are almost
[1:32:32] everywhere around the world. So we are
[1:32:35] not the only ones. So it's not our
[1:32:37] church. This is what we stand for.
[1:32:41] Are you hearing me? So friends, this man
[1:32:46] was not called to follow any religion.
[1:32:49] But here is one thing he was talking.
[1:32:53] Believe
[1:32:55] on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:32:58] and you shall be saved
[1:33:00] and thy house.
[1:33:04] What? Nothing else. Nothing else.
[1:33:09] Believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:33:12] and thou shalt be saved. Why? because he
[1:33:16] has done all the fighting.
[1:33:19] He has done all the actions, all the
[1:33:22] works, all the battle. And he has won
[1:33:25] the victory.
[1:33:27] And he is here in the form of his work
[1:33:31] to claim every trophy
[1:33:35] of his victory.
[1:33:38] I am one of them. I was claimed.
[1:33:41] [Music]
[1:33:42] I came out where I was. I came out of a
[1:33:45] life of sin. I came out of my
[1:33:48] denomination. I came out where I was and
[1:33:51] here I am. I believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:33:54] Christ.
[1:33:57] And what shows you believe on him, you
[1:33:59] will do everything he tells you to do.
[1:34:03] That's why we get baptized in much water
[1:34:07] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:34:10] If you continue reading down there, this
[1:34:13] man was baptized that very
[1:34:17] past midnight.
[1:34:22] Trophies of his grace.
[1:34:26] If you want to hear more, you
[1:34:28] can come on stream on Wednesday.
[1:34:33] We'll take it farther. God bless you.
[1:34:34] You can stand on your feet.
[1:34:42] Hallelujah.
[1:34:43] Hallelujah.
[1:34:45] Praise the Lord.
[1:34:47] I want us to send this little light of
[1:34:49] mine.
[1:34:54] I want to let it shine.
[1:34:56] I want the world to know.
[1:34:59] I want to display myself before the
[1:35:00] world
[1:35:02] as a trophy of his grace.
[1:35:05] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:07] By the way, I'm happy to see brother
[1:35:08] Samuel.
[1:35:12] Amen. So, if you've never given your
[1:35:13] life to Jesus,
[1:35:18] you can be a trophy, too.
[1:35:21] Or you've not been baptized in the name
[1:35:22] of Jesus Christ.
[1:35:26] As we sing, I'll just invite you to come
[1:35:28] only those are here
[1:35:32] to come and we lead you to him.
[1:35:35] Hallelujah.
[1:35:37] He's just wonderful.

[2:18:01] read this announcement to you. Sister
[2:18:03] Ruth has sent greetings to the church.
[2:18:05] Sister Ruth is a sister. She's one of us
[2:18:08] uh that gave birth recently to a baby,
[2:18:11] brother Martin. Was it a baby girl? Baby
[2:18:13] boy, I don't remember.
[2:18:15] A baby girl. Yes. So, she's been away
[2:18:18] being taken care of by one of our
[2:18:20] sisters. So, she has sent greetings. I
[2:18:22] think she'll be here next uh next
[2:18:25] weekend. So, uh we thank God for that
[2:18:29] baby and the safe delivery of that baby.
[2:18:33] Amen. And also uh some of you may not
[2:18:36] know already we have the budget for our
[2:18:39] youth meetings already it is out. I
[2:18:42] would like this interpreted for some
[2:18:44] people who are here and others who are
[2:18:46] streaming and cannot understand English.
[2:18:48] So brother Martin you want to take the
[2:18:50] microphone and and help interpret
[2:18:52] please.
[2:18:54] So we already have our budget out uh for
[2:18:58] our January youth meetings.
[2:19:02] [Music]
[2:19:25] Youth meetings.
[2:19:27] Our meetings are going to take place
[2:19:29] 12th to 14th January.
[2:19:35] It's a grand time.
[2:19:38] uh last year. By the way, I always said
[2:19:40] last year, but we had it January this
[2:19:42] year
[2:19:46] meeting.
[2:19:49] So, our next is January 2024.
[2:19:55] So, the last time was a wonderful time.
[2:19:58] We had brother Isaac from Nairobi
[2:20:00] ministering
[2:20:03] and also brother
[2:20:06] Michael from Canada also ministering
[2:20:11] uh but this uh this one we are going to
[2:20:13] have um other min ministry to come
[2:20:20] invited brother Timothy PR and Timothy
[2:20:25] from the USA and also Brother David
[2:20:28] Mayor from from uh France
[2:20:33] France.
[2:20:34] There there's also other brothers coming
[2:20:37] and um we we are looking forward to this
[2:20:41] time because we know these ministers
[2:20:43] that are coming that I failed to invite.
[2:20:51] We have not invited them because they
[2:20:53] coming from Canada and France.
[2:21:01] But we've invited them because their
[2:21:03] ministry has widely blessed the young
[2:21:07] people over the years.
[2:21:15] We've been preaching many youth camps
[2:21:20] and I've watched those services myself.
[2:21:26] Some of you might have already watched
[2:21:28] brother Timothy
[2:21:30] preaching
[2:21:34] and you might have already been blessed
[2:21:35] by their ministry.
[2:21:40] I believe their ministry will bless the
[2:21:41] young people in Uganda.
[2:21:45] I'm not inviting them for our
[2:21:46] fellowship.
[2:21:51] inviting them for the country
[2:21:56] because we are going to have young
[2:21:58] people coming from many churches
[2:22:04] from as far as
[2:22:08] um in the south
[2:22:12] in the east
[2:22:15] and um others are going to be coming
[2:22:17] from Kala
[2:22:20] the churches we are going to invite to
[2:22:21] all the churches.
[2:22:24] We are not inviting all the people. We
[2:22:25] inviting only the younger people from
[2:22:27] the churches.
[2:22:33] And I know not all of them will come
[2:22:36] because one reason or the other.
[2:22:40] So I understand that others will not be
[2:22:43] able to come. So we shall also be
[2:22:45] streaming those services.
[2:22:51] So, uh it's going to be
[2:22:55] um a very a grand time if I may say.
[2:23:01] We also have um fellowships from Kenya,
[2:23:04] churches from Kenya who want to be a
[2:23:06] part of us.
[2:23:09] Also from Ethiopia
[2:23:12] also from Zimbabwe Zimbabwe. So let's
[2:23:15] look forward to that and be in prayer
[2:23:18] youth meetings.
[2:23:22] The young people in this church, I
[2:23:23] expect you to participate 100%.
[2:23:30] So our budget is out.
[2:23:33] We going to need not less than 30
[2:23:34] millions
[2:23:38] uh to to to be able to host the
[2:23:40] meetings.
[2:23:43] It's going to be three days Friday
[2:23:45] night. It will begin Friday night and
[2:23:46] then throughout Saturday then Sunday.
[2:23:52] So um we have we we have already
[2:23:56] announced and asked people coming in
[2:23:58] from other churches to contribute.
[2:24:05] every individual will at least
[2:24:06] contribute 50,000
[2:24:12] at least 50 50,000.
[2:24:15] So which means they can contribute more.
[2:24:20] Last year we had um close to 300 people.
[2:24:27] So this year we expect to have um
[2:24:31] 100 or 200 more
[2:24:38] that will make it in the regions of 4
[2:24:40] 500.
[2:24:44] It could be more or less.
[2:24:50] So uh with that number you you can
[2:24:52] understand that even if everybody
[2:24:53] contributed 50,000
[2:25:02] It will not fully finance the whole
[2:25:04] budget.
[2:25:07] We are the ones hosting the meetings.
[2:25:11] So we ought to contribute more.
[2:25:14] So uh on that note I already we agreed
[2:25:17] with with our team
[2:25:22] but at least each member member each
[2:25:25] young person each adult member whoever
[2:25:28] fellowships here
[2:25:31] [Music]
[2:25:34] should contribute at least a 100,000
[2:25:40] to make that possible.
[2:25:43] You can contribute that money
[2:25:44] immediately right now after the service
[2:25:46] on your website.
