[24:08] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[24:10] &gt;&gt; We are so happy to be here today.
[24:16] I remember it was about two years ago
[24:23] when I first came.
[24:29] I used to hear about ever since I was
[24:31] young.
[24:36] But when I came here,
[24:39] I fell in love with the people.
[24:43] And I remember I was standing with
[24:45] pastor uh pastor Peter Al.
[24:53] And pastor I promise you
[24:58] that will not be the last time
[25:02] but we will keep coming
[25:06] to he and the other pastors.
[25:10] So
[25:15] he and the other pastors questioned me
[25:20] that if the Lord makes a way
[25:25] that if it is possible
[25:29] we keep coming
[25:32] but that also we bring good ministers of
[25:35] the message.
[25:41] So
[25:43] I am simply here to fulfill that
[25:45] commitment.
[25:58] How many here believe in the in the Lord
[26:01] Jesus Christ?
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[26:07] All right.
[26:10] How [snorts] many here
[26:13] we are baptized in much water in the
[26:16] name of the Lord Jesus Christ?
[26:24] All right. Amen. We are believers.
[26:28] How many here
[26:31] believe that God has sent us a prophet
[26:38] with a message of restoration.
[26:45] Amen. Amen. And because of this,
[26:50] we have come here
[26:53] &gt;&gt; not just walking aimlessly.
[26:59] But because we are believers of this
[27:01] message
[27:07] whenever we are with brother Guma.
[27:12] He tells us of how God used our precious
[27:16] brother John Mark.
[27:26] And
[27:28] and when the Lord called him,
[27:34] God has raised an army of ministers
[27:43] that uh that have stood with this
[27:46] message.
[27:51] And they have continued to preach it.
[28:09] uh printing this message. Uh printing
[28:13] this message.
[28:29] How many appreciate reading the message
[28:31] of the hour?
[28:37] Okay.
[28:40] If you don't get those books
[28:46] and uh brother Michael Ray was here from
[28:50] Canada
[28:56] by the way he has sent you greetings
[29:03] and uh they're helping us
[29:11] to work on the Bible.
[29:24] And uh this Bible is going to have the
[29:27] Old Testament, the very first one, the
[29:29] good one.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:32] Hallelujah.
[29:36] So
[29:55] and
[29:58] and very soon
[30:02] it will be printed and brought
[30:11] You say brother Michael received that
[30:15] burden to do that for when he came.
[30:38] Okay.
[30:45] So, how many here have a Bible? Put up
[30:47] your Bible.
[31:02] So you see many don't have Bibles
[31:09] but
[31:11] very soon everyone will have a Bible.
[31:22] Friends,
[31:24] &gt;&gt; we are not coming here to Karamoja
[31:29] because we have a special doctrine.
[31:39] We are coming here
[31:41] just five minutes. We are coming here
[31:44] because we believe the same message
[31:46] which you believe.
[31:59] And we are coming here to stand behind a
[32:02] ministry.
[32:11] And we appreciate all the pastors, the
[32:13] men of God.
[32:20] And the only reason why we are coming
[32:22] here,
[32:25] we are not coming.
[32:28] We are not coming to cause division.
[32:35] We are coming to hold their hands,
[32:39] the ministers,
[32:41] PASTORS,
[32:49] so that listen so that together
[32:57] we can be able to edify the body OF
[32:59] CHRIST IN CANADA.
[33:06] Now
[33:08] before I sit down,
[33:10] listen carefully.
[33:13] It's not easy to come here.
[33:18] That's why there are many who had never
[33:21] come.
[33:30] No one can only come here because they
[33:32] are burdened for you.
[33:43] Because
[33:45] because
[33:48] remember the bride is not going in the
[33:51] rapture until she's perfected.
[34:03] Believing is one thing, but the church
[34:07] must go on unto perfection.
[34:18] And the only thing going to do that is
[34:20] the message, THE WORD. [screaming]
[34:29] SO what we need is the word.
[34:37] Tell your neighbor we need the word.
[34:44] And we need God to send us men of the
[34:47] word.
[34:54] Not another MESSAGE
[34:58] but the same MESSAGE
[35:01] WHICH BROTHER BHAM PREACHED.
[35:07] THE SAME MESSAGE
[35:09] which brother John Mark introduced in
[35:11] this in this region.
[35:15] THE SAME MESSAGE
[35:17] WHICH THE pastors have been preaching to
[35:19] you in your local church.
[35:26] SO WHEN YOU COME TO A CONFESSION LIKE
[35:28] THIS,
[35:31] put all your MIND
[35:35] on hearing the word.
[35:39] HAVE A DESIRE. HAVE THE HUNGER.
[35:43] HAVE THE APPETITE.
[35:47] HOW MANY are hungry to hear the word?
[35:51] Now I have good news for you this
[35:55] morning, this afternoon. Hallelujah.
[35:57] Listen. Hallelujah.
[36:06] And the good news are
[36:10] God has sent us another man of the word.
[36:14] Listen,
[36:24] the minister going to speak to you this
[36:25] morning, this afternoon
[36:31] was supposed to be preaching in
[36:36] convention.
[36:46] There are many other places he's invited
[36:48] to go.
[36:53] He's very busy.
[36:58] He's not from near
[37:02] all the way from a place called New
[37:04] York, USA.
[37:15] It took him It took him two three days
[37:18] to arrive in Enlight.
[37:36] And when he arrived, his luggage was
[37:38] lost.
[37:46] Several times
[37:49] the devil was trying to hinder him from
[37:51] arriving here.
[37:59] There must be something
[38:04] THAT YOU THAT GOD KNOWS THAT YOU need
[38:11] and the devil was trying to hinder it.
[38:18] There is something
[38:21] that God blessed in this ministry
[38:28] that the Lord knew
[38:32] you will need today.
[38:36] And in this convention
[38:40] and uh quite frankly I can tell you
[38:42] this.
[38:45] I met Pastor Simon in Zimbabwe.
[38:51] He was preaching for
[38:57] and I heard him preach
[39:01] and I was blessed
[39:05] beyond measure.
[39:09] Which food do you like eating here? What
[39:11] is it? The food.
[39:14] What is the name of the food?
[39:16] What's the name of the food in Kamoja?
[39:18] &gt;&gt; Angadish.
[39:19] &gt;&gt; Angadish.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Angadish.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Angish.
[39:22] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; Angish.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; Angadish.
[39:25] &gt;&gt; If you have if you have ever eaten
[39:26] angish
[39:29] very tasty in the mouth,
[39:32] you want to eat more.
[39:35] THAT IS HOW I WAS FEELING WHEN he was
[39:37] preaching.
[39:43] So when the pastors ASKED ME TO INVITE
[39:46] someone to come,
[39:53] they told me pastor you come and preach
[39:55] but if you have someone also bring them
[40:02] but I said even if I don't preach
[40:06] I know someone who will serve us angish
[40:15] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. And so
[40:20] why AM I SAYING THAT?
[40:23] I WANT YOU to have an expectation.
[40:30] I know you love the Lord.
[40:34] Otherwise, you could not sit under this
[40:37] sun.
[40:43] So
[40:45] I say God is going to bless you.
[40:53] God is going to speak to you.
[40:58] Amen. Amen.
[40:59] &gt;&gt; So his name is Pastor Simon Peterson say
[41:06] from New York, USA.
[41:09] York, USA.
[41:10] &gt;&gt; And you know, one time
[41:13] one man said,
[41:16] "To whom shall we go
[41:20] that has the words of eternal life?
[41:26] They came to JESUS
[41:29] because of fish.
[41:33] They came TO JESUS
[41:36] BECAUSE OF BREAD.
[41:38] THEY CAME TO Jesus
[41:41] because he was healing them and doing
[41:44] things.
[41:49] BUT
[41:50] WHEN HE BROUGHT OUT THE WORD,
[41:56] they left.
[41:58] They walked away.
[42:00] Why? because they did not have the
[42:03] hunger for the word.
[42:07] But Simon Peter said,
[42:11] "AND I HOPE THERE IS SOMEONE HERE
[42:15] who is like Simon Peter."
[42:19] HE SAID, JESUS SAID, "DO YOU ALSO WANT
[42:22] TO GO?"
[42:26] He said, "TO WHOM SHALL WE GO?
[42:30] WHO HAS THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE.
[42:34] So the people were hungry.
[42:38] Simon Peter was hungry
[42:42] for THE WORD. AND THIS AFTERNOON,
[42:46] God has sent us another Simon Peter.
[42:52] And he will give us nothing but the word
[42:54] which he had already.
[43:02] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[43:04] AMEN.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; CAN we say amen?
[43:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:06] &gt;&gt; CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; ALL RIGHT.
[43:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[43:10] &gt;&gt; SO, can I usher in Pastor Simon, if you
[43:12] can please come, let us believe the Lord
[43:15] is going to speak to us this morning.
[43:19] Let's put our hands together for the man
[43:21] of God.
[43:32] Praise the Lord.
[43:35] &gt;&gt; Like to greet you all in the name of our
[43:37] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[43:45] It is
[43:47] it is an honor for me to be here.
[43:54] It was very difficult for me to come.
[44:00] I want to say one thing to you
[44:08] really have a burden and love for you
[44:10] people.
[44:26] We met in Zimbabwe. As he said,
[44:33] I did not know that God had a plan for
[44:36] me to be here.
[44:56] We talk about the mission work over
[44:57] there.
[45:03] When I went back, we stay connected.
[45:12] I almost did not come,
[45:21] &gt;&gt; but uh God wanted me to be here.
[45:28] Brother came to him in
[45:40] I was I was sleeping because of time
[45:43] difference. It was 200 a.m. in the
[45:45] morning.
[45:57] The the phone rang.
[46:04] I I don't shut my phone off.
[46:11] I I picked the phone.
[46:13] I heard then behold it was him.
[46:21] He said, "I have a brother here.
[46:27] I want to greet you and speak to you.
[46:32] So he put brother um John Mark
[46:40] and brother John Mark spoke to me about
[46:41] the meetings
[46:47] we spoke
[46:49] and that changed everything finally.
[47:01] I I I told my wife
[47:05] and she said she said I think you should
[47:07] go.
[47:12] So and by the grace of God we are here.
[47:20] May God bless you.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. May God bless the ministers.
[47:29] If if you are here today
[47:33] is it is because of their labors
[47:40] and may God bless all of you servants of
[47:42] God.
[47:48] The reason why we are here
[47:53] is because God sent a prophet
[47:59] is this message of the hour
[48:04] that has gathered us together.
[48:09] The United Nations.
[48:16] They have tried to bring nations
[48:17] together
[48:22] but they have never succeeded.
[48:28] What they failed to do
[48:33] this message have succeeded to do
[48:46] When I go anywhere,
[48:51] I meet believers.
[48:54] When you don't know them, you meet them
[48:56] for the first time.
[49:04] You feel at home.
[49:08] No suspicion.
[49:11] We are one body.
[49:14] We are the children of God.
[49:17] We [snorts] came from God.
[49:19] WE ARE GOING BACK TO GOD.
[49:22] BLESSED be the name of the Lord.
[49:25] It doesn't matter where YOU ARE.
[49:29] It doesn't matter what you have.
[49:32] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT you don't have.
[49:36] Praise the NAME OF THE LORD.
[49:39] THERE'S SOMETHING in you
[49:42] THAT IS GREATER THAN ALL THE RICHES OF
[49:45] THE WORLD.
[49:48] HALLELUJAH.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[49:49] &gt;&gt; And I believe that is why the message
[49:51] came to this region.
[49:59] We are here because of the message of
[50:02] the hour.
[50:07] May the name of the Lord be praised.
[50:12] We we have no agenda
[50:17] but to bring to preach Christ
[50:24] said
[50:26] this message is Christ.
[50:32] So I trust that I will say something
[50:34] that will be of a help to us.
[50:43] God bless you.
[50:47] Let us stand to our feet as we read.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[51:00] &gt;&gt; Heaven Father,
[51:03] We thank you
[51:07] for this wonderful opportunity you've
[51:09] given unto us
[51:13] to come among your children.
[51:18] We humbly ask that you help us.
[51:23] Give us grace to see something that will
[51:25] help your people.
[51:31] We don't want to come to the place where
[51:33] we feel we know it all
[51:39] because there is always a more of you.
[51:46] Open our understanding.
[51:50] Bind every spirit
[51:54] that is contrary to the spirit of God.
[51:59] We spell it in the name of Jesus Christ.
[52:04] We take authority over every foul devil,
[52:10] many powers
[52:13] that is ruling in this environment
[52:16] in the mighty name of Jesus Christ.
[52:20] MAY the pillar of fire
[52:23] move among us Lord.
[52:26] THE angel of the Lord
[52:29] minister to every need.
[52:32] HEAL the sick Lord
[52:35] baptize with the Holy Ghost.
[52:39] In Jesus name we pray.
[52:41] Amen.
[52:44] Amen. If you have your Bibles with you,
[52:50] &gt;&gt; I would like to read from Genesis 15
[52:53] verse 13.
[53:04] Genesis 15:13,
[53:18] the Bible says,
[53:21] "And he said unto Abraham,
[53:27] No opportunity
[53:32] that thy seed shall be a stranger in a
[53:35] land that is not theirs, and shall serve
[53:38] them, and they shall afflict them 400
[53:41] years.
[53:45] And also that nation
[53:48] serve
[53:49] will I judge, and afterward
[53:53] they shall come out with great
[53:55] substance.
[54:45] Thank
[54:48] Scripture
[54:52] Revelation 18 verse4
[55:01] and I heard another voice from heaven
[55:03] saying come out of her my people that
[55:06] you be not partakers of our sin that you
[55:09] receive not our Please.
[55:39] Amen. Amen.
[55:41] God bless the reading of his word.
[55:46] You can please take your seat.
[55:50] I want to speak to you this afternoon.
[55:57] And the message I entitled the calling
[55:59] out of God's people.
[56:11] Amen.
[56:13] God
[56:15] made a covenant with Abraham.
[56:22] God gave a promise.
[56:28] This promise was not only to Abraham,
[56:36] but God extended that promise to his
[56:39] seed.
[56:46] God knows the future.
[56:51] He told his friend Abraham,
[56:56] "Your seed
[56:59] will be in a strange land.
[57:04] THEY WILL BE THERE FOR 400 YEARS.
[57:11] And at THE END OF THE 400 years,
[57:16] God said,
[57:18] I God will bring them out.
[57:26] Amen. Amen. When the hour came,
[57:31] God remembered his promise.
[57:38] Amen. Amen. God raised a prophet
[57:46] by the name of Moses
[57:51] who was born born in a peculiar way.
[57:58] God
[58:00] allowed the enemy to even raise Moses
[58:03] up.
[58:10] Amen. AMEN. WHEN THE HOUR OF deliverance
[58:12] came,
[58:16] GOD APPEARED to the prophet Moses.
[58:24] God in this Bible
[58:28] when whenever he wants to speak,
[58:34] he chooses a prophet.
[58:40] HE SAID, "I GOD will do nothing
[58:47] EXCEPT I REVEAL MY secret
[58:55] to my servant the prophet."
[59:01] Amen. Amen.
[59:02] &gt;&gt; When God was about to destroy THIS
[59:05] WORLD,
[59:10] GOD REVEALED THAT SECRET TO NOAH.
[59:19] When God was about to to h to bring
[59:22] Israel out of Egypt,
[59:28] GOD REVEALED THAT SECRET TO MOSES.
[59:35] If you want to know the secret of God,
[59:43] you must come to a prophet.
[59:48] HALLELUJAH.
[59:49] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; TO SERVE God
[59:53] in every generation,
[59:57] you must come to a prophet.
[1:00:01] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:00:04] JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS A PROPHET.
[1:00:10] PROPHETS ARE NOT TAUGHT by men.
[1:00:17] PROPHETS ARE TAUGHT by God himself.
[1:00:25] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:00:30] IT IS VERY IMPORTANT
[1:00:36] if you want to serve God
[1:00:40] correctly
[1:00:44] in any generation.
[1:00:48] You must come to a a prophet.
[1:00:53] I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FALSE PROPHETS.
[1:00:59] BUT A MAN SENT [screaming] FROM GOD.
[1:01:06] HALLELUJAH.
[1:01:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT PROPHET COMES,
[1:01:12] GOD WILL VINDICATE THAT THIS is my
[1:01:15] prophet.
[1:01:22] God said I am God and I CHANGE NOT.
[1:01:29] DO YOU KNOW THAT IN THE DAYS OF NOAH
[1:01:31] there were many preachers?
[1:01:38] THE BIBLE SAYS THAT NOAH WAS A PREACHER
[1:01:41] of righteousness.
[1:01:50] That means they were preachers of
[1:01:52] unrighteousness.
[1:01:58] Hallelujah. AMEN. THAT IS WHY WE CAN
[1:02:00] READ ABOUT the Elijah,
[1:02:04] THE JEREMIAH,
[1:02:07] the Isaiah.
[1:02:09] GOD WILL SEND THIS MAN at different
[1:02:11] generations
[1:02:16] TO REVEAL HIS PLAN OF REDEMPTION FOR
[1:02:20] THAT GENERATION.
[1:02:27] WAY [screaming]
[1:02:30] THAT YOU CAN ESCAPE THE JUDGMENT OF GOD.
[1:02:37] So come to that prophet.
[1:02:40] Can we say amen? Amen.
[1:02:43] AMEN. THOSE WHO ESCAPED THE JUDGMENT
[1:02:46] DURING THE DAYS OF NOAH WERE THOSE WHO
[1:02:49] BELIEVE THE MESSAGE OF LAW.
[1:03:00] HALLELUJAH.
[1:03:01] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A PROPHET HAS THE MIND OF GOD.
[1:03:10] WE NEVER KNEW HOW TO WORSHIP GOD.
[1:03:18] BUT GOD SENT US A PROPHET.
[1:03:22] TO SHOW US how to approach God.
[1:03:32] THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,
[1:03:36] they went to Egypt.
[1:03:41] EGYPT
[1:03:42] IS LIKE the world.
[1:03:46] They were there in Egypt.
[1:03:49] Egypt was a PLACE WHERE YOU HAVE A LOT
[1:03:51] OF IDOLS
[1:03:56] PEOPLE WERE WORSHIPING THE GOD OF THE
[1:03:59] NILE
[1:04:03] many many different gods.
[1:04:06] Praise the Lord.
[1:04:08] GOD SENT A PROPHET
[1:04:12] with the word of the Lord
[1:04:16] AND GOD FOR HIM TO PROVE THAT HE'S GOD
[1:04:22] OVER ALL [screaming] THE GODS
[1:04:26] FOR ALL OTHER GODS ARE IDOLS.
[1:04:31] GOD BROUGHT JUDGMENT OVER THE GOD OF THE
[1:04:34] NILE.
[1:04:38] TURN THE water into blood.
[1:04:43] Praise the NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS GOD DOING?
[1:04:48] God was SHOWING
[1:04:52] THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF MOSES
[1:04:57] that is a living God.
[1:05:01] MOSES DID SIGNS AND WONDERS.
[1:05:06] TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF GOD'S
[1:05:09] PEOPLE.
[1:05:15] HALLELUJAH.
[1:05:17] God is now going to bring them out of
[1:05:20] Egypt
[1:05:24] to take them to a place
[1:05:28] WHERE THEY WILL WORSHIP GOD.
[1:05:35] Can we say amen?
[1:05:37] WE WERE CHILDREN OF GOD.
[1:05:41] WE WERE IN DIFFERENT areas
[1:05:45] worshiping IDOLS
[1:05:48] WORSHIPING THE GOD OF OUR FATHERS.
[1:05:53] FOR GOD'S [screaming] GRACE CAME DOWN TO
[1:05:55] EARTH.
[1:05:59] GOD SENT A PROPHET.
[1:06:03] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; AND ONE OF YOUR SONS
[1:06:09] GOT A HOLD OF THIS MESSAGE
[1:06:14] AND BROUGHT IT TO THIS REGION.
[1:06:20] WHY?
[1:06:21] BECAUSE YOU WERE HERE.
[1:06:25] The message came because of you.
[1:06:31] AMEN. PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; AND THIS message
[1:06:37] brought [screaming] US
[1:06:40] out of our tribes,
[1:06:45] our idols.
[1:06:48] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. And he brought us
[1:06:52] to worship God.
[1:06:58] THIS MESSAGE HAS COME TO SHOW US HOW TO
[1:07:02] WORSHIP GOD.
[1:07:08] AMEN.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And amen.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. SO WE SEE THAT MOSES BROUGHT
[1:07:14] THE PEOPLE OUT
[1:07:19] AND LED THEM OUT OF EGYPT.
[1:07:23] WHEN HE WENT TO PHARAOH,
[1:07:28] GOD TOLD HIM,
[1:07:30] "WHEN YOU GO TO PHARAOH,
[1:07:33] tell Pharaoh
[1:07:36] that thus say the Lord,
[1:07:40] let my people go
[1:07:44] SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP ME."
[1:07:50] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:07:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN. GOD WANTED HIS PEOPLE TO WORSHIP
[1:07:54] HIM.
[1:08:01] WE ARE NOT HERE TO WORSHIP WILLIAM BRHAM
[1:08:09] [screaming]
[1:08:10] BROUGHT US TO JESUS CHRIST.
[1:08:17] The prophet OF GOD
[1:08:20] CAME TO SHOW US HOW TO WORSHIP GOD.
[1:08:30] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:08:33] God never wanted them to be in Egypt.
[1:08:40] GOD NEVER WANTED THE INFLUENCE OF EGYPT.
[1:08:47] GOD NEVER WANTED THEM to copy the
[1:08:50] denominations.
[1:08:57] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. HE BROUGHT THEM
[1:09:00] [screaming] OUT
[1:09:04] SO THAT THEY CAN WORSHIP HIM
[1:09:08] ACCORDING TO THE WAY
[1:09:12] HE WANT THEM TO BE. WE WANT HIM TO BE
[1:09:14] WORSHIPED.
[1:09:20] PRAY THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:09:24] THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED WHEN GOD SENDS A
[1:09:26] PROPHET.
[1:09:32] HE COME TO SHOW [screaming] YOU HOW TO
[1:09:34] WORSHIP THE TRUE AND LIVING GOD.
[1:09:41] A prophet ALWAYS COME TO MAKE GOD KNOWN
[1:09:43] to the people.
[1:09:51] IN THE ABSENCE OF A PROPHET,
[1:09:58] he will start worshiping idols.
[1:10:06] Amen. After the fall, after the fall,
[1:10:15] when man became blind spiritually,
[1:10:24] a man will look at the tree
[1:10:27] and say, "This look like God."
[1:10:32] They make an idol out of a tree.
[1:10:39] They make idol out of a stone.
[1:10:44] Can we say amen? AMEN. SO THAT IS WHY
[1:10:48] [screaming]
[1:10:49] GOD WAS TELLING THEM.
[1:10:52] THOU SHALT HAVE NO OTHER GOD BESIDES ME.
[1:11:02] Praise the Lord.
[1:11:09] these people,
[1:11:12] Israel
[1:11:15] under Moses ministry,
[1:11:21] THEY BEGAN TO WORSHIP GOD.
[1:11:26] BUT AS TIME WENT BY,
[1:11:30] they begin to bring THE IDEAS OF EGYPT.
[1:11:39] ARE WE TOGETHER? YES.
[1:11:45] They began to do things.
[1:11:49] THEY WANTED TO BE LIKE THE OTHER
[1:11:51] NATIONS.
[1:11:56] They wanted TO BE LIKE THE OTHER
[1:11:58] CHURCHES.
[1:12:02] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; BUT REMEMBER,
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT TO BE LIKE THE DENOMINATIONS.
[1:12:12] THERE
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; IS A REASON WHY WE CALL OURSEL MESSAGE
[1:12:15] BELIEVERS.
[1:12:24] THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR [screaming]
[1:12:28] HAS COME TO SHOW US
[1:12:32] how to worship.
[1:12:38] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHEN MOSES
[1:12:41] BROUGHT THEM OUT OF EGYPT,
[1:12:46] GOD EVEN SHOWED MOSES
[1:12:50] HOW THE WOMEN and men should dress.
[1:13:00] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT DRESS LIKE THE EGYPTIANS.
[1:13:10] GOD REVEALED TO MOSES.
[1:13:14] AMEN. AMEN. the honor of the priesthood.
[1:13:24] IF YOU WANT TO BE A PRIEST,
[1:13:28] YOU HAVE TO BE BORN OUT OF A CERTAIN
[1:13:30] LINEAGE.
[1:13:35] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:13:38] GOD SHOW THEM
[1:13:42] THE SACRIFICES THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE.
[1:13:49] GOD [screaming] SHOW MOSES.
[1:13:53] ARE YOU WITH ME?
[1:13:56] GOD SHOWED PROPHET MOSES
[1:14:00] HOW TO BUILD THE TABERNACLE.
[1:14:06] God showed [screaming] Moses,
[1:14:10] how the priest MUST REST.
[1:14:15] GOD SHOWED MOSES
[1:14:18] WHEN THE PRIEST ENTER INTO THE
[1:14:20] TABERNACLE,
[1:14:24] THERE'S A WAY THE PRIEST MUST WALK.
[1:14:30] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. BECAUSE MOSES
[1:14:36] &gt;&gt; WAS [screaming] A PROPHET
[1:14:38] THAT CAME AND BROUGHT THE MIND OF God
[1:14:44] to the people.
[1:14:48] AMEN. IN ORDER FOR YOU TO WORSHIP GOD
[1:14:51] CORRECTLY,
[1:14:56] you have to come to Moses.
[1:15:00] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. ANY WORSHIP
[1:15:05] OUTSIDE [screaming] OF WHAT MOSES SAID
[1:15:11] is not of God. [screaming]
[1:15:14] ANY SACRIFICE
[1:15:17] that anybody BRING
[1:15:20] OUTSIDE OF THE ORDER OF MOSES,
[1:15:25] GOD WILL NOT ACCEPT IT.
[1:15:28] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; IT IS ONLY A PROPHET
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; THAT [screaming] SHOWS YOU HOW TO
[1:15:35] WORSHIP GOD.
[1:15:39] HALLELUJAH.
[1:15:40] AMEN.
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; NO MATTER THE SACRIFICES
[1:15:45] THAT WE TRY TO PRESENT TO GOD,
[1:15:48] IF IT IS CONTRARY
[1:15:51] TO THE [screaming] WORD OF THE LORD,
[1:15:56] GOD WILL NEVER RECEIVE IT.
[1:16:00] TOGETHER.
[1:16:03] Say amen. Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; When Jesus came,
[1:16:08] they were saying to Jesus,
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; WE BELIEVE IN MOSES
[1:16:13] AND WE ARE CHILDREN OF MOSES. MOSES SAID
[1:16:16] THIS. MOSES SAID THAT
[1:16:19] JESUS LOOK AT THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE
[1:16:22] LEFT FROM THE ORDER OF MOSES.
[1:16:27] He said, "Let me tell you, my friends,
[1:16:31] in vain you worship God,
[1:16:35] because you are teaching for doctrines
[1:16:40] the commandments of men.
[1:16:47] Are we together?"
[1:16:52] One day,
[1:16:54] Jesus went to the temple.
[1:16:59] Why did he meet in the church?
[1:17:03] They've made shops in the house of
[1:17:08] Yeah.
[1:17:11] There was a Baptist market,
[1:17:18] a Pentecostal market.
[1:17:22] METHODISTS HAVE THEIR OWN MARKET.
[1:17:27] OH, COME TO OUR DENOMINATION.
[1:17:32] WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY OF SALVATION.
[1:17:36] THE BAPTIST SAY, "COME TO OUR CHURCH.
[1:17:40] WE WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY OF GOD
[1:17:43] FOR WHAT THEY NEVER KNEW.
[1:17:46] THEY WERE SELLING LAMBS."
[1:17:50] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; JESUS, LOOK AT THE WAY THEY WERE
[1:17:53] WORSHIPING.
[1:17:56] HE LOOK AT THE LAW OF MOSES.
[1:18:00] HE KNEW THAT THEY HAVE DEVIATED FROM THE
[1:18:02] WORSHIP OF GOD.
[1:18:07] HE SAID YOUR WORSHIP IS REJECTED.
[1:18:12] If you have an UNDERSTANDING
[1:18:16] OF WHAT MOSES WAS PREACHING,
[1:18:19] YOU WILL COME [screaming] TO THE
[1:18:20] REALIZATION
[1:18:23] THAT I AM THE LAMB OF GOD.
[1:18:29] CAN I SAY AMEN? AMEN. WHEN YOU TAKE YOUR
[1:18:32] EYES
[1:18:35] off of the message,
[1:18:39] YOU WILL PRODUCE A FALSE WORSHIP
[1:18:45] THAT GOD WILL REJECT AT THE END.
[1:18:50] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:18:52] THAT IS WHY [screaming]
[1:18:54] FOR YOU AND ME WILL MAKE IT TO this
[1:18:56] generation.
[1:18:59] Come to the message of the hour.
[1:19:00] [screaming]
[1:19:03] READ THE MESSAGE.
[1:19:06] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:19:08] IF I SAY SOMETHING,
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; THE ONLY WAY THAT YOU KNOW IS THE TRUTH.
[1:19:16] IS WHEN YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROPHET SAID,
[1:19:22] TODAY
[1:19:24] WE ARE MADE IDOLS OF MEN.
[1:19:31] ALL THESE BIG PREACHERS FROM AMERICA.
[1:19:35] ALL THIS ONE FROM AUSTRALIA.
[1:19:37] THERE'S only one prophet.
[1:19:41] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:19:43] HE IS THE ONE. [screaming]
[1:19:45] WE MUST LISTEN TO
[1:19:51] AMEN. MAY GOD HELP US.
[1:19:55] JESUS CHRIST.
[1:19:58] REJECTED THEIR WORSHIP.
[1:20:03] John the Baptist,
[1:20:06] his daddy was a priest.
[1:20:11] He was a theologian.
[1:20:15] John
[1:20:17] John's uh ministry was so important.
[1:20:25] God never allow John to go to his
[1:20:28] daddy's Bible school.
[1:20:36] At the age of nine,
[1:20:40] God sent him to the wilderness.
[1:20:44] Can we say amen? Amen. When John CAME ON
[1:20:47] THE SCENE, LOOK AT HIS PREACHING.
[1:20:52] when was in the wilderness
[1:20:55] saw how tricky the serpents are.
[1:21:05] He look at the RELIGIOUS PEOPLE.
[1:21:08] HE SAY YOU ARE GENERATION OF VIPERS.
[1:21:14] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. YOU DON'T NEED
[1:21:17] TO GO TO BIBLE SCHOOL.
[1:21:21] to get the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:24] CAN WE SAY AMEN TO TEACH YOU the word?
[1:21:32] YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN.
[1:21:35] CAN I SAY AMEN? GOD IS NOT A RESPECTCTOR
[1:21:39] OF PERSONS.
[1:21:43] GOD IS INTERESTED IN HIS WORD.
[1:21:50] AMEN.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; WHY?
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; There were many things they have changed
[1:21:56] in the message of
[1:22:02] if you go to the original message of
[1:22:04] Moses.
[1:22:09] Moses told them
[1:22:12] when you want to bring a sacrifice
[1:22:18] Go and take the lamb, a lamb, an animal
[1:22:24] from your own fold.
[1:22:29] Are we together?
[1:22:33] Because this animal that you are taking
[1:22:35] care of
[1:22:38] there is a connection.
[1:22:41] SO THAT WHEN YOU ARE BRINGING THE
[1:22:43] ANIMAL,
[1:22:46] YOU ARE BRINGING IT TO GOD WITH FEELING.
[1:22:53] Are we together?
[1:22:55] But as time progress,
[1:22:59] the people, the ministers begin to
[1:23:01] change things here and there and here.
[1:23:08] They said we will make it easy for the
[1:23:10] people
[1:23:15] because God has blessed them with money.
[1:23:20] You don't need to go to your farm
[1:23:21] anymore.
[1:23:25] Just come
[1:23:27] in our shop,
[1:23:31] pay money.
[1:23:34] You see the gospel must not be about
[1:23:37] money BUSINESS
[1:23:46] right for money.
[1:23:51] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; IF GOD CALLS YOU, HE WILL TAKE CARE OF
[1:23:55] YOU.
[1:23:59] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:24:01] &gt;&gt; WE MUST STAND FOR THE WORD OF GOD
[1:24:07] SO THAT WE CAN HELP OUR [screaming]
[1:24:08] PEOPLE.
[1:24:13] It became a money-m business.
[1:24:19] AND ANYBODY THAT HAVE A LOT OF MONEY
[1:24:21] FROM SOMEWHERE, THEY WILL COME AND BUY
[1:24:23] YOU WITH THEIR DOCTRINE.
[1:24:31] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. THEY BEGIN TO
[1:24:34] TEACH things
[1:24:38] that was CONTRARY TO WHAT MOSES taught
[1:24:40] them.
[1:24:46] They became blind.
[1:24:48] They became very blind.
[1:24:53] There is nothing you could tell them.
[1:24:58] BECAUSE THAT SPIRIT HAS BLINDING THEM.
[1:25:04] THEY CRUCIFY
[1:25:07] THE VERY MESSIAH
[1:25:11] THAT THEY WERE SINGING ABOUT IN THE IN
[1:25:12] IN IN THE TEMPLE.
[1:25:17] David under inspiration.
[1:25:22] HE WAS WRITING
[1:25:24] A SONG.
[1:25:26] MY GOD, MY GOD, WHY HAST THOU FORSAKEN
[1:25:29] ME?
[1:25:35] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; I BELIEVE THEY WERE SINGING THOSE SONGS.
[1:25:39] [screaming]
[1:25:42] JOHN THE BAPTIST
[1:25:44] SAID, "BEHOLD [screaming] THE LAMB OF
[1:25:45] GOD."
[1:25:49] JOHN THE BAPTIST
[1:25:51] WAS a prophet.
[1:25:54] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; IS ONLY A PROPHET
[1:25:59] THAT IS ABLE TO IDENTIFY
[1:26:03] THE MESSIAH FOR YOUR DAY.
[1:26:09] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:26:12] Prophets are born different.
[1:26:18] PROPHETS ARE DESIGNED DIFFERENT.
[1:26:23] THEY HAVE [screaming]
[1:26:24] THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO HEAR FROM GOD.
[1:26:31] In a way
[1:26:33] that none of us have.
[1:26:37] Maybe in the next service I I will go
[1:26:39] deeper into that if God will lead me
[1:26:40] that way.
[1:26:45] When
[1:26:47] God was speaking when God was speaking
[1:26:50] to Moses,
[1:26:52] the people were under the mountain. They
[1:26:55] were down the mountain. The church
[1:26:58] AS GOD WAS SPEAKING,
[1:27:01] "THOU SHALT NOT COMMIT ADULTERY.
[1:27:06] THOU SHALT NOT LIE. [screaming]
[1:27:09] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE.
[1:27:12] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE DOWN THERE,
[1:27:15] ALL [screaming] THEY WERE HEARING
[1:27:18] WAS THUNDER AND LIGHTNINGS.
[1:27:23] THE VOICE OF GOD [screaming]
[1:27:26] IS THE VOICE OF A THUNDER.
[1:27:30] CAN WE SAY AMEN? [screaming]
[1:27:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN. A PROPHET
[1:27:34] IS DESIGNED
[1:27:36] TO ENTER INTO THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[1:27:40] AND [screaming] HEAR THE ORIGINAL VOICE
[1:27:43] OF GOD.
[1:27:46] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? [screaming]
[1:27:48] HE COMES DOWN TO THE PEOPLE
[1:27:51] AND HE BEGIN TO INTERPRET WHAT GOD WAS
[1:27:53] SAYING.
[1:27:58] AMEN.
[1:28:00] Don't take this prophet like any of this
[1:28:01] evangelist.
[1:28:03] Don't take William Brham like this other
[1:28:05] evangelist
[1:28:10] is a prophet
[1:28:12] sent to this generation.
[1:28:19] You see
[1:28:21] God's ways are past [music] finding out.
[1:28:24] God's ways is difficult to understand.
[1:28:32] When they went to Egypt,
[1:28:36] you know, Joseph went there.
[1:28:39] Is that right?
[1:28:41] &gt;&gt; Jacob was in Palestine.
[1:28:46] When they were going to Egypt,
[1:28:50] they never cross a sea.
[1:28:57] That mean there was another route to go
[1:28:58] to Egypt.
[1:29:04] But God wanted to prove his
[1:29:11] GOD [screaming]
[1:29:12] CAME DOWN
[1:29:15] and he began to lead the prophet.
[1:29:20] DON'T DOUBT A PROPHET.
[1:29:26] DON'T QUESTION [screaming] A PROPHET.
[1:29:30] CAN WE SAY AMEN? [screaming]
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; DON'T QUESTION THIS MESSAGE.
[1:29:37] IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THINGS,
[1:29:41] DON'T PUT YOUR IDEAS INTO IT.
[1:29:45] Don't put your opinion to it.
[1:29:48] ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:29:51] BECAUSE GOD [screaming]
[1:29:53] WILL TEACH US
[1:29:55] GOD GOD WILL REQUIRE THE BLOOD OF THE
[1:29:57] PEOPLE
[1:29:59] FROM OUR HANDS.
[1:30:02] WE BETTER BE SURE [screaming]
[1:30:06] THAT WHAT WE ARE PREACHING
[1:30:09] AND WE ARE TELLING THE PEOPLE
[1:30:11] IS WHAT THE PROPHET HALLELUJAH
[1:30:15] HAS SPOKEN IN THIS GENERATION.
[1:30:22] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:30:26] We are people that were called out.
[1:30:33] Now
[1:30:35] God told Abraham,
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; God also told Moses,
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; when you go to Pharaoh,
[1:30:48] Pharaoh have held the people in bondage.
[1:30:51] So
[1:30:56] are we together?
[1:30:58] PHARAOH HAD MADE SLAVE OUT OF THEM.
[1:31:01] make he made them slaves.
[1:31:08] They were too much busy
[1:31:12] improving the economy of Egypt,
[1:31:19] no time to pray,
[1:31:22] no time for church,
[1:31:24] no time for worship.
[1:31:27] Their businesses became more important.
[1:31:31] GOD NEVER WANTED HIS PEOPLE TO be in
[1:31:33] bondage.
[1:31:37] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:31:38] &gt;&gt; DON'T LET YOUR CATTLE BUSINESS STOP YOU
[1:31:41] FROM COMING TO CHURCH.
[1:31:46] SEEKING FIRST THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN.
[1:31:51] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHEN YOU PUT GOD FIRST
[1:31:54] IN YOUR LIFE,
[1:31:58] GOD WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU.
[1:32:03] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:32:05] MAY THE NAME OF THE Lord be praised. So,
[1:32:09] you know,
[1:32:12] Moses even showed them how to marry.
[1:32:19] Yes. You see those unbelievers
[1:32:25] Don't go and pick a woman from there.
[1:32:33] God said,
[1:32:35] Moses told them, if you do that,
[1:32:42] if they if you marry from a woman that
[1:32:45] is an idol worship, who is not a
[1:32:47] believer,
[1:32:54] He will turn your heart.
[1:32:58] Are we together?
[1:33:01] Wasn't that what Ahab did?
[1:33:10] AHAB [screaming]
[1:33:12] NEGLECTED INSTRUCTION OF MOSES.
[1:33:15] He neglected THE INSTRUCTIONS OF MOSES.
[1:33:22] HE WENT AND HE MARRIED JEZEBEL.
[1:33:29] CAN WE SAY AMEN CONTRARY TO WHAT MOSES
[1:33:32] SAID?
[1:33:36] HE BROUGHT IDOLATRY IN IN IN IN THE
[1:33:38] CHURCH.
[1:33:43] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:33:45] I'M SAYING THIS
[1:33:47] TO SHOW YOU [screaming]
[1:33:50] THE IMPORTANCE
[1:33:52] of a God send prophet.
[1:34:00] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE NEED TO DROP OUR
[1:34:04] OWN IDEAS
[1:34:10] AND GO INTO THE MESSAGE.
[1:34:14] TRANSLATOR.
[1:34:17] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO DROP OUR ideas
[1:34:23] and check the message.
[1:34:26] Check the Bible.
[1:34:29] Brother,
[1:34:32] HIS MESSAGE
[1:34:34] BROUGHT US BACK to the Bible.
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:42] Amen.
[1:34:43] IF WE FAIL TO FOLLOW THE PROPHET
[1:34:45] CORRECTLY,
[1:34:50] all our effort will be in vain.
[1:34:58] When Moses
[1:35:01] left the church
[1:35:04] just for a short period
[1:35:09] to go up to the mountain
[1:35:12] to receive the law of God.
[1:35:17] In the absence of the prophet,
[1:35:21] the people put pressure on the ministry
[1:35:28] TO TO BUILD a golden calf.
[1:35:36] Are we together?
[1:35:38] Let's be careful so we will not build
[1:35:40] golden calf around.
[1:35:47] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:35:50] WE ARE NOT POINTING THE PEOPLE TO
[1:35:51] OURSELVES.
[1:35:54] WE MUST POINT THEM TO JESUS CHRIST.
[1:36:00] CHRIST [screaming] IS YOUR SAVIOR.
[1:36:05] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN. [screaming]
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; CHRIST DIED FOR YOU.
[1:36:09] WHATEVER SAID,
[1:36:12] MY MINISTRY
[1:36:14] IS TO CONNECT YOU
[1:36:17] TO CHRIST.
[1:36:20] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:36:24] I'm not talking about the Pentecostal
[1:36:26] Christ.
[1:36:29] Pentecost have their own Jesus.
[1:36:33] METHODIST HAVE THEIR OWN JESUS.
[1:36:36] METHODIST HAVE THEIR OWN JESUS.
[1:36:38] THERE IS A WAY THEY BAPTIZE.
[1:36:41] THERE'S A WAY THEY TAKE THEIR COMMUNION.
[1:36:44] CAN WE SAY AMEN? THERE WAS A WAY THEY
[1:36:47] RUN THE CHURCH.
[1:36:51] William Brandham
[1:36:53] has come in this generation
[1:36:57] to show us how to worship God.
[1:37:06] Let me say this without fear,
[1:37:10] any preacher,
[1:37:13] any preacher
[1:37:16] in this generation
[1:37:18] that that try to the office of a prophet
[1:37:22] make themsel that equal with a prophet.
[1:37:24] They are false.
[1:37:31] THERE WAS NOBODY LIKE MOSES.
[1:37:35] CAN I SAY AMEN?
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; THERE WAS NO ONE LIKE MOSES.
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; THERE IS NO ONE LIKE WILLIAM BRANDON IN
[1:37:43] THIS GENERATION.
[1:37:47] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:37:49] HE KNOWS THE WAY.
[1:37:52] WILLIAM BRHAM KNOWS [screaming] THE WAY.
[1:37:55] WILLIAM BRHAM KNOWS THE WAY.
[1:37:59] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. IF YOU WANT TO KNOW GOD,
[1:38:03] IF YOU REJECT, WILL EMBRACE
[1:38:22] for the effort of printing the books in
[1:38:25] your own language.
[1:38:28] Listen,
[1:38:31] it's it's very important
[1:38:37] said
[1:38:39] the people in the days of Paul,
[1:38:43] they knew the message
[1:38:46] the way Paul preached it.
[1:38:51] He said, "Oh,
[1:38:53] the believers in
[1:38:59] he said they are noble
[1:39:06] because whatever.
[1:39:10] They go back and check it
[1:39:14] whether it is so or not."
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. LET ME TELL YOU
[1:39:20] FRIENDS,
[1:39:22] THERE IS NOTHING HIGHER THAN THE WORD OF
[1:39:24] GOD,
[1:39:27] THERE'S NOTHING GREATER THAN THIS
[1:39:29] MESSAGE.
[1:39:32] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. READ THE
[1:39:35] MESSAGE.
[1:39:37] LISTEN TO THE TEXT.
[1:39:40] GOD WILL REVEAL HIMSELF TO YOU.
[1:39:45] When the first apostles came in the days
[1:39:47] of Paul,
[1:39:51] They begin to change things
[1:39:57] said
[1:39:58] it was not the pastors. It was not the
[1:40:01] pastors that challen those false
[1:40:02] preachers.
[1:40:05] It was the congregation
[1:40:08] because they were taught.
[1:40:12] THEY KNEW THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:40:14] THEY KNEW THE MESSAGE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:40:18] AMEN.
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; AND THEY LOOK THEM TO THE [screaming]
[1:40:20] EYE.
[1:40:21] IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM.
[1:40:24] IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU ARE BLACK OR
[1:40:26] WHITE.
[1:40:28] THEY SAY YOU ARE NOT SAYING WHAT PAUL
[1:40:30] SAY.
[1:40:32] THEREFORE, YOU ARE FALSE.
[1:40:34] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WE MUST KNOW WHAT THIS
[1:40:38] MESSAGE IS ALL ABOUT. [screaming]
[1:40:49] May God help us.
[1:40:54] I don't know when to close.
[1:40:58] Maybe I'll close in a moment and maybe
[1:41:00] when we come back later we
[1:41:09] say
[1:41:11] Paul was saying brethren
[1:41:14] I don't want you to be ignorant.
[1:41:19] Your fathers,
[1:41:22] they were all under the cloud.
[1:41:29] They passed through the sea.
[1:41:35] They were baptized
[1:41:38] unto Moses.
[1:41:42] He said they drunk from that rock.
[1:41:50] Let me tell you, don't be deceived.
[1:41:54] These people
[1:41:56] enjoy the signs and the wonders.
[1:42:03] WHEN GOD OPENED THE RED SEA,
[1:42:08] THEY SAW IT.
[1:42:11] THEY WALKED THROUGH.
[1:42:13] They went OVER ON THE OTHER SIDE.
[1:42:16] THEY SAW THEIR ENEMIES DYING.
[1:42:20] THEY SAW PHARAOH DEFEATED.
[1:42:23] CAN WE SAY AMEN? THEY WERE THERE IN
[1:42:26] EGYPT.
[1:42:28] WHEN THERE WAS DARKNESS IN EGYPT
[1:42:31] IN THERE WAS LIGHT,
[1:42:36] THEY ENJOYED THE BENEFIT OF THE EXODUS.
[1:42:43] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? WHEN MOSES STRUCK THE
[1:42:46] ROCK,
[1:42:48] THEY DRANK FROM THE WATER. [screaming]
[1:42:52] THEY ATE THE MANA THAT CAME FROM HEAVEN.
[1:42:57] THEY WERE REJOICING OVER THE MANA.
[1:43:00] THEY WERE HAPPY. HALLELUJAH.
[1:43:03] OH, MOSES HAVE SENT US A PROPHET.
[1:43:06] OH, [screaming] I MEAN GOD HAVE SENT US
[1:43:08] MOSES.
[1:43:10] WE LOVE THE PROPHET. WE ARE THE
[1:43:13] BELIEVERS OF THE MESSAGE.
[1:43:18] But let's see what Paul says.
[1:43:22] THE BIBLE SAYS
[1:43:25] MANY OF them
[1:43:28] God not well pleased.
[1:43:36] They were overthrown in the wilderness.
[1:43:42] Why would God
[1:43:46] not be happy with the people
[1:43:49] for whom he killed Pharaoh and his army?
[1:43:56] Why will he not be pleased with the
[1:43:57] people
[1:44:01] to whom he gave mana from heaven? The
[1:44:02] Bible say he gave them angels.
[1:44:09] They were no more. They were no more in
[1:44:12] Egypt.
[1:44:14] They were message believers FOLLOWING
[1:44:16] THE MESSAGE
[1:44:17] ENJOYING THE BENEFITS OF THE MESSAGE.
[1:44:22] Why was God not pleased with him?
[1:44:27] Because
[1:44:29] the reason God brought them out
[1:44:33] is for them to worship him.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:44:39] And what did God do?
[1:44:43] God opened the seals
[1:44:51] out of the law.
[1:44:55] brought the Lord to them
[1:44:58] so that by the word of God,
[1:45:02] they know how to come to church,
[1:45:06] the husbands
[1:45:09] will know how to treat their wives.
[1:45:14] Are we together?
[1:45:18] Husband, love your wives.
[1:45:23] Your wife is a daughter of God.
[1:45:27] Treat her like a slave.
[1:45:32] Are we together?
[1:45:35] WIVES
[1:45:37] BE OBEDIENT TO YOUR HUSBANDS.
[1:45:40] CHILDREN, OBEY YOUR PARENTS.
[1:45:45] WHEN THEY BELIEVE THE TEACHINGS OF
[1:45:47] MOSES,
[1:45:49] IT MAKE THEM A PECULIAR PEOPLE.
[1:45:53] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; THE REASON WHY YOU ARE DIFFERENT.
[1:45:59] CAN WE SAY AMEN? THIS MESSAGE OF THE
[1:46:01] HOUR
[1:46:03] TOLD YOU TO LOVE one another.
[1:46:07] THIS MESSAGE OF THE HOUR
[1:46:10] IS ABOVE TRY.
[1:46:13] Is above tribe.
[1:46:16] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? IF A MAN IS BORN
[1:46:20] AGAIN,
[1:46:22] God will DELIVER HIM FROM TRIBAL SPIRIT.
[1:46:28] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:46:30] WE DELIVER THEM FROM NATIONAL SPIRIT.
[1:46:34] ONE WILL COME FOR JESUS CHRIST.
[1:46:39] We are we are Amen. WE HAVE ONE NATIONAL
[1:46:43] SPIRIT. OUR
[1:46:47] NATIONAL SPIRIT IS THE HOLY GHOST.
[1:46:52] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; SAID
[1:46:56] the Holy Ghost will not BEHAVE IN ONE
[1:46:58] PERSON IN one brother.
[1:47:02] Misbehave in another brother.
[1:47:06] Can I say amen? IF YOU MISBEHAVE,
[1:47:10] YOU met a ghost.
[1:47:13] have a ghost
[1:47:15] but that is a devil ghost.
[1:47:18] CAN WE SAY AMEN? THE HOLY GHOST IS HOLY.
[1:47:23] CAN WE SAY AMEN? THE HOLY GHOST WILL
[1:47:25] MAKE YOU RESPECT YOUR ELDERS.
[1:47:31] That is why.
[1:47:33] When we come here, we have not come to
[1:47:36] try to make our bosses
[1:47:39] COME TO SUPPORT WHAT YOU ARE DOING.
[1:47:43] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; WHAT GOOD WILL it do us?
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; I can't begin to condemn all these
[1:47:50] brothers
[1:47:52] and then Jesus. I'm gone.
[1:47:56] It's not wise.
[1:48:01] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:48:06] May use me
[1:48:08] to help you. God might use you.
[1:48:12] God might use you to help me.
[1:48:16] AMEN.
[1:48:17] &gt;&gt; SAID THERE'S NO BIG ONE AMONG US.
[1:48:21] THERE'S NO SMALL ONE AMONG US. JESUS
[1:48:25] CHRIST
[1:48:26] IS A GREATER PERSON. HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:30] HE SAID LITTLE CHILDREN
[1:48:32] LOVE ONE ANOTHER.
[1:48:35] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN. BAM WAS THE MOST
[1:48:39] HUMBLE MAN IN YOUR GENERATION.
[1:48:44] Came to Africa.
[1:48:47] HALLELUJAH. HE NEVER TAKE HIMSELF ABOVE
[1:48:50] THE PEOPLE.
[1:48:52] MAY GOD GIVE US GRACE.
[1:48:55] May the Lord help us.
[1:48:59] This message
[1:49:02] we must know what it is.
[1:49:06] It's not just saying, "Oh yeah, I
[1:49:07] believe I go a prophet.
[1:49:12] The voice came
[1:49:15] to show you even how to run your
[1:49:17] church." YOU KNOW, BROTHER SHOWS US HOW
[1:49:18] to run the church
[1:49:21] IS THERE JUST LIKE MOSES.
[1:49:24] The order of worship,
[1:49:27] how how we should enter church,
[1:49:30] what we should do and what we should not
[1:49:31] do.
[1:49:33] Can we say amen?
[1:49:35] how we should preach.
[1:49:37] The qualification of a ministry
[1:49:42] change the word of God.
[1:49:45] God say I am God I change not.
[1:49:50] Are you with me church? May God help us.
[1:49:54] May God help us to understand the
[1:49:57] ministry of a prophet.
[1:50:01] If you know the message,
[1:50:04] I can't come here and deceive you
[1:50:08] because you know the message and that is
[1:50:10] why we encouraging you
[1:50:13] the message.
[1:50:17] Belove him today
[1:50:20] as I close this session
[1:50:23] I want you to see the importance
[1:50:26] of a prophet.
[1:50:31] Why God send Will?
[1:50:36] Why? What did he bring to us?
[1:50:42] Let me tell you something.
[1:50:45] When Moses
[1:50:47] went to Egypt,
[1:50:49] I'm closing here. When Moses went to
[1:50:51] Egypt,
[1:50:54] he did a sign.
[1:50:56] He did a wonder.
[1:51:04] This this thing that you are doing
[1:51:08] is a cheap magic.
[1:51:13] Pharaoh
[1:51:16] magicians
[1:51:19] could do the same things that Moses
[1:51:25] when he throw the stick and he turn to a
[1:51:27] serpent.
[1:51:30] He also did a miracle and brought
[1:51:32] serpents on the sea.
[1:51:37] In other words, Moses Pharaoh was said,
[1:51:39] "This thing that you come to do is not
[1:51:41] new.
[1:51:46] The men can do the same thing."
[1:51:53] But what was the difference?
[1:51:59] friends was the word
[1:52:04] God's desire
[1:52:08] to worship him.
[1:52:11] And if we are going to worship him,
[1:52:14] we have to worship him the way he want
[1:52:16] us to worship him.
[1:52:22] And the only way to find out
[1:52:26] is to go to the books of Moses.
[1:52:31] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:52:33] There's an understanding
[1:52:36] that comes to you.
[1:52:38] When you are reading the books of the
[1:52:40] prophet,
[1:52:44] Amen. When the children of Israel were
[1:52:45] in bondage,
[1:52:48] they were to go to Babylon.
[1:52:50] When you go back from Babylon
[1:52:53] back home,
[1:52:55] Daniel
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; was reading the books of the prophet.
[1:53:04] Daniel,
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; he said, "As I was reading, I understood
[1:53:08] by books
[1:53:10] OF PROPHET JEREMIAH
[1:53:13] THAT IT IS TIME FOR US TO RETURN HOME."
[1:53:17] CAN WE SAY AMEN? AMEN.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE HOUR,
[1:53:23] YOU MUST READ THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR.
[1:53:26] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME?
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; 71 YEARS AGO,
[1:53:33] WILLIAM SAID
[1:53:36] ONE DAY A POPE WILL COME OUT OF THE
[1:53:38] UNITED STATES.
[1:53:41] HALLELUJAH.
[1:53:43] JUST FEW MONTHS AGO OR MAYBE ABOUT A
[1:53:45] YEAR NOW,
[1:53:47] IT WAS FULFILLED.
[1:53:50] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[1:53:51] THE END TIME IS HERE.
[1:53:54] THE RAPTURE IS COMING CLOSER.
[1:53:57] BUT IN ORDER FOR YOU TO BE IN THE
[1:53:59] RAPTURE,
[1:54:01] YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE MESSAGE OF THE
[1:54:02] HOUR.

[1:54:12] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU WITH ME, CHURCH? MAY GOD HELP

[1:54:58] WILLIAM'S MESSAGE
[1:55:01] IS THE ONE and only message
[1:55:05] that will take you IN THE RAPTURE.
[1:55:08] MAY GOD BLESS YOU. May God give you
[1:55:11] grace.
[1:55:13] May God help us to have an understanding
[1:55:16] of what this message is all about.
[1:55:20] It's not another denomination.
[1:55:24] We are called out.
[1:55:26] God be with you.
[1:55:28] God bless you. Let's bow heads as I
[1:55:31] pray.

[1:59:24] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; YOU KNOW WHAT?
[1:59:30] Father was an Anglican priest
[1:59:37] and I I had this Bible
[1:59:41] but I was blind
[1:59:43] and I did not know.
[1:59:46] BUT THEN
[1:59:48] SOMEONE TOLD ME God sent a prophet.
[1:59:55] AND WHEN I STARTED READING THIS MESSAGE
[1:59:57] of this prophet,
[2:00:01] I started understanding my Bible.
[2:00:07] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY we are so
[2:00:12] happy that God has sent us a message.
[2:00:19] Because now we know who we are.
[2:00:23] THIS IS A CALLING
[2:00:26] of God FOR US TO COME OUT
[2:00:32] and then come back to the word.
[2:00:35] How many appreciate what we have heard
[2:00:37] today?
[2:00:40] Amen. Amen. Amen. That's just a
[2:00:44] beginning.
[2:00:48] You know
[2:00:50] there is one thing that pastor say that
[2:00:52] really made me so so happy and I saw
[2:00:55] other pastors they are very excited.
[2:01:02] He said
[2:01:05] if uh you know when when God sent Paul
[2:01:08] with a message
[2:01:14] later he
[2:01:19] know of COURSE OTHER PREACHERS CAME
[2:01:20] other ministers came
[2:01:26] and then they listen to them.
[2:01:32] What they saw
[2:01:36] what they were saying was not exactly
[2:01:38] what Paul said.
[2:01:45] They called them false teachers.
[2:01:51] So the question is,
[2:01:54] do you know THE
[2:01:58] FALSE TEACHER AND A TRUE TEACHER.
[2:02:04] You can only KNOW IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT
[2:02:06] Paul said.
[2:02:12] BUT REMEMBER
[2:02:15] Paul
[2:02:17] was the FIRST CHURCH AGE MESSENGER.
[2:02:24] How many ages DO WE HAVE?
[2:02:30] SEVEN AGE.
[2:02:33] WE HAVE NO EIGHTH AGE.
[2:02:37] We only have seven ages.
[2:02:41] And how many messengers?
[2:02:45] Seven messengers.
[2:02:48] AND PAUL WAS THE FIRST ONE.
[2:02:52] And do you know the age we are living
[2:02:53] in?
[2:02:56] Ask your neighbor, do you know the age
[2:02:58] we are living in?
[2:03:03] Do you know that we are living in?
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, I know.
[2:03:06] &gt;&gt; Do you know?
[2:03:07] &gt;&gt; I know.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; What did they say? Which age are we
[2:03:10] living in?
[2:03:15] Which age are we living in?
[2:03:20] What? What did she say?
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; The seventh age. How do you say that in
[2:03:33] Amen?
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; WE ARE IN THE SEVENTH AGE.
[2:03:38] LISTEN, THE SEVENTH AGE IS THE LAST AGE.
[2:03:46] AFTER THIS AGE,
[2:03:49] the rapture
[2:03:53] Amen.
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; YOU CANNOT GO IN A RAPTURE [screaming]
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; unless if you are PREPARED
[2:04:08] in every AGE
[2:04:12] messenger
[2:04:14] with a message to prepare the bride.
[2:04:20] NOW THE MESSENGER IS NOT THE MESSAGE.
[2:04:26] THE MESSENGER IS NOT A MESSAGE
[2:04:31] BUT IN EVERY AGE
[2:04:34] THE message is Christ.
[2:04:39] NOW
[2:04:41] IN OUR LAST AGE
[2:04:45] GOD HAS SENT US A MESSENGER. HIS
[2:04:51] name is William Brham.
[2:04:56] THAT'S HIS MESSAGE. THAT'S HIS NAME. AND
[2:04:59] YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD GAVE HIM A MESSAGE.
[2:05:04] AND THIS MESSAGE IS TO CALL A BRIDE,
[2:05:09] OUT OF RELIGION,
[2:05:11] OUT OF THE SYSTEMS of man,
[2:05:15] out of uh you know some of you were
[2:05:16] warriors.
[2:05:19] ONE MAN
[2:05:21] CALLED JOHN MARKOUS
[2:05:25] WHEN HIS EYES WERE OPEN TO THIS PERSON.
[2:05:29] LISTEN
[2:05:31] WHERE HIS EYES WERE OPENED.
[2:05:35] He ran to this REGION
[2:05:39] HAVING A FIRE IN HIS HEART.
[2:05:43] EVERY SEED OF GOD HERE MUST COME OUT.
[2:05:51] And we are here.
[2:05:54] [screaming]
[2:05:56] God had you on mind.
[2:06:02] NOW
[2:06:05] THE DECEIVERS ARE STILL there in the
[2:06:07] world
[2:06:11] because the devil IS NOT YET FINISHED
[2:06:12] his job.
[2:06:18] In every season,
[2:06:20] EVERY
[2:06:23] TIME THERE WILL BE those who will TRY TO
[2:06:26] CREEP IN.
[2:06:32] HOW CAN WE KNOW THEM
[2:06:36] when they creep in?
[2:06:39] WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT OUR MESSENGER SAY.
[2:06:47] HOW CAN WE KNOW?
[2:06:50] By reading and hearing the message OF
[2:06:53] OUR DAY.
[2:07:00] YOU SEE, WHEN THE PASTORS READ THE
[2:07:02] message
[2:07:05] and they listen to it
[2:07:08] and the people listen to the message
[2:07:11] and they read it,
[2:07:13] I cannot deceive you.
[2:07:16] The pastor cannot deceive you.
[2:07:19] WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE A solid foundation.
[2:07:28] So what we have had this uh morning
[2:07:33] just to encourage us.
[2:07:37] We have been called out.
[2:07:42] We are not any denomination.

[2:08:38] GOD TOLD YOU OUT.

[2:09:01] RELIGION,
[2:09:05] but we were blind.
[2:09:08] WE HAD A BIBLE,
[2:09:10] BUT WE WERE BAPTIZING
[2:09:16] We didn't even know
[2:09:19] that we are supposed to be baptized in
[2:09:21] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:09:27] We thought God is three.
[2:09:33] BUT
[2:09:34] GOD sent a prophet with a message.
[2:09:40] NOW WHEN WE READ OUR BIBLES,
[2:09:45] WE UNDERSTAND WHAT WE ARE READY.

[2:18:22] So I believe that this very sermon that
[2:18:25] has let us go
[2:18:30] will still come back.
[2:18:33] He will be given his time.
[2:18:37] because of chasing time.
[2:18:41] So he was supposed to have preached for
[2:18:44] two hours.
[2:18:49] So okay though he came late to the pal
[2:18:52] here but he used this two hours fully.
[2:18:57] So there is nothing that has been broken
[2:18:59] in that arrangement. So,
[2:19:03] so there is the report coming from the
[2:19:06] kitchen.
