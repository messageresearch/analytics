too we are going to fight the devil the end blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen amen I'm not joking I mean what I'm saying and the devil knows what I'm speaking about blessed be the name of the Lord we shall hit the devil and we shall drag him back to hell that's where he belongs the devil does not belong here he has no portion in our life he has no in our he belongs to hell he belongs to

receive this word Lord you laid it in my heart and I know that there's somebody Lord who will not remain the same to come and speak to us Lord Jes May the same anointing which was upon you Lord that same Holy Spirit may he move in in Jesus name amen he said the spirit of the Lord Lord is upon me because the Lord ha anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he have sent me to bind up brokenhearted to Proclaim Liberty to the captive and and the opening of the prison to them that abound Amen to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of Vengeance of our God to comfort all that man blessed be the name of the Lord [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord praise be to God you may have your seats as I told you we are here to undress the devil don't let the devil deceive you this evening let that guy go blessed be the name of Jesus declared our Liberty when he died on the cross he said it is finished amen he meant that amen amen the devil has no right to make you live in sin he has no right to sment your body because your body is the Temple of the Living God where the Holy Ghost dwells not where the devil dwells amen one day the devil had the temple but when Jesus met that man the man of Gana amen demons knew that the master of that Temple had come they had to give way and they told Jesus why have you come this to us before our time praise be to God Demon said sonto us so they requested Jesus at least let us go and those those speak no we shall not be the Temple of demons we rather go and commit suicide amen amen if pigs which have no soul would not accommodate demons but rather ch to commit suicide who are you to allow the in your life amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's why I was telling you we are sending him to Heaven that's where he belongs blessed be the name of the Lord I'm going to take my inspiration tonight in the message the Year of Jubilee and I'm here to declare your Jubilee you are free to accept your Jubilee or to reject blessed be the name of the Lord amen you know when Jesus was on Earth the Pharisees the SES amen they were lowke Keepers they were observing it to the door and they could preach in the temple amen they could get the scripture and read the scripture unto us the child is born to us the son is given name will be called wonderful Prince of Peace the Mighty God and then the service but that same son on Earth amen performing Miracles setting the captive free and they knew him not blessed be the name of the Lord amen so one day after sometime Jesus came to the temple that changed everything that was the turning point and I'm here to tell you if you can believe the Lord Jesus tonight is going to be the turning point in your life amen then he read these words the spirit of the Lord is upon me the spirit of the Lord is the Lord God is upon me because he ha anointed me to preach Good Tidings unto the meek he has sent me to bind the Broken Heart the Lord has send me also tonight find the broken heart Amen to proclaim the Liberty to the captive are you in captivity tonight I am here in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to Proclaim your Liberty living here when you free amen and the opening of the prison to them that abound which prison are you inight which prison do you think that God cannot open it blessed be the I'm here to tell you the Lord can open any person there is no prison which he cannot open he does not need the key amen but when the angel of the Lord comes down he will stand before the door and the door will open blessed be the name of the Lord I don't care whether your prison door is analog whether it is analog door it just open by itself which don't open by themselves blessed be the name of the Lord the angel of the Lord comes down amen the doors will have to open that angel is not very far he is already here he has come he's opening them doors blessed be the name of the Lord amen if you want to see the pillar of fire is already here praise be to God amen amen the Jubilee and here Jesus is speaking about the same year which is the accepted of the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and according to scriptures Leviticus 25 Leviticus 25 the Bible about Jubilee amen and Jubilee Ever After Jubilee there was something that happened blessed be the name of the Lord the lord gave them the law concerning how they supposed to use their land and other things and he told them how they would cultivate the but on the seventh year they had to leave it amen blessed be the name of the Lord praise be to God and year we are seeing in Israel every after seven years was the year of Liberty the year of the release of those who are in prison blessed be the name of the Lord amen just follow me closely praise be to the Lord I told you my inspiration is from this message the jubile and say that that every seven year it was the law of God that there was a jubilee and when the Jubilee come when come by the priest Rod the the uh Rod the land and sounding the trumpet blessed be the name of the Lord and that trumpet was the trumpet of Le of release blessed be the name of the Lord amen God has never left us without a refuge even in the Old Testament there was a city of and when you commit offense accidentally and maybe you kill somebody you had to run brother you had to run as fast as you can until you enter in that City when you you enter that City brother feel free now amen that was in the Old Testament the Bible tells me the name of the Lord is strong and mighty power where the right just run and they are saved and what is the name of the Lord there's no Any Other Name Us in heaven on Earth underneath by the name of Jesus Christ and that name every tongue shall confess every knee bow blessed be the name of the Lord that was just a shadow that was the shadow talking about Jesus Christ being a refuge for sinner blessed be the name of the Lord and I could just imagine maybe you are cutting the tree and according to calculation it was that the will fall on the left then accidentally the thing goes and fell on the right and then you kill somebody remember the law according to the law shedding in shedding innocent blood nobody was allowed to kill anybody amen then the moment search incidents happen brother you have to run you have to run as fast as you can I can just imagine such a person it's when your enemy they running 150 km per hour that was the Old Testament but when it comes to the New Testament Believers the Lord has given us the city of and is calling us to run in that City and for them they don't care Gods I your enemy they after you they are chasing you coming after your life and enter in Christ tonight amen blessed be the name of the Lord but when I'm saying this very message praise be to God that maybe were sold in slavery you could not serve forever be there counting Counting weeks counting months Counting yes amen amen a day will come every day come every day which go it's gone praise the Lord let me tell you church every day gone by that day will never come back that day is getting us close to rapture praise be to God Amen I believe this they even reached a point like years and with blessed be the name of the Lord that is how it ought to be amen praise be to God they were there busy serving maybe digging maybe making bricks maybe maybe cleaning people who go to us to clean people go to America to clean old people and the job they gave you to bathe old people blessed be the name of they did all that in their mind they knew that one day that will be the end blessed be the name of Amen how long have you been in your bondage I'm here to tell you it's going to take your faith if you believe tonight not tomorrow tonight amen when the angel was passing where Jacob was Jacob never told the angel see you tomorrow man tomorrow he was not even sure whether he was an angel but theep there was deeping jaob told him if you let that

testimony it's very interesting testimony of a man who whose leg one was shorter than the other blessed be the name of the Lord but when he came in the meeting like this Hallelujah he went and bought new shoes new pair of shoes I think I've ever seen those people this man had faith when he saw what God was doing he went to B of them days I believe he bought bought very expensive shoes and then

God can do he had his Jubilee blessed be the name of the Lord he was born for some time but that day was the day of his Jubilee amen blessed be the name of the Lord because the preacher was was

change in our lives prepare yourself always when you are coming for a service have enough time with God and watch and see what will what will take place but I'm says there is something interested in

Begin to Fall until businessmen would go to work and sit down at their desk and weep like babies and close their meat their businesses for farmers in the field would be sitting on their plows or

blowing and everything and there was a Revival on brother bam says here what we need tonight is the holy ghost moving amongst the people claiming the year of Freedom blessed be the name of the Lord I

Spirit help and the word of God provided it that the Seal of God is the baptism of the Holy Ghost without the Holy Spirit you are not sealed but the holy spirit is God's seal and then that all that was not sealed by the Holy Spirit was uh was okay they took on the mark of the beast and the mark of the beast is the mark of apostasy which is the which is the the the which is rejecting the Holy Spirit what is the holy spirit the word you reject the word you reject the holy spirit amen and he said that is the mark of Apostles rejecting the Holy Spirit the word not only in written form amen but the Bible says when the spirit that raise Christ from the dwelleth in us he Quicken our mortal bodies we shall not struggle with things when that Spirit comes and dwell in our soul blessed be the name of the Lord but you see then when the Year of Jubilee all the blast comes and the people receive the Holy Spirit and you Del you deliberately willfully turn it down God has no more oh not under any more obligation to ever speak to you more then you will be mark off and the old type of the Old Testament that is the type and the shadow of the new to reject Christ and to turn him down that he that he's kicked at your door you are on Danger on a danger life of being bored bored the ear faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God are you seeing how terrible it is every time the word is preached you are taught to receive the Holy Ghost you don't care say they will preach tomorrow again I will hear it brother you may not have that chance again but abam says you deliberately refuse you chose to stay in the borderline and God will put a will put blind over your ears God himself will put it over your ears you'll be a good church member you'll be a religious person when God himself has put that in your ears not to hear anymore blessed be the name of the Lord God will put that in your ears that you will never be able to understand no more you will do more than criticize the gospel as as long as you live and die and be lost forever what a terrible thing you will just be a message believer putting on long dresses and criticizing every word that is preached he was too redh it's too much also just putting on lip bmms what's wrong with lip balms brother bham says it is a warning God himself will put it on your ears that you'll never hear anymore and you will never be able to understand no more and you will do no more than criticize the gospel as long as you live and die and be lost forever what a time while the Jubilee time while the doors are still open do you realize that the same B of the Holy Ghost have been oh Hallelujah the same B of the Holy ghost is what you are talking about is hearing the voice of the Jubilee gospel being preached to you and say Here I Am Lord seal me Lord help me Lord Hold Me Lord forgive me Lord the first thing I had to do with Divine gift was within the heart of the people the B of the Holy Spirit fell the first time since Pentecost in Russia so it tells us what happened in Russia they turned down the Holy Spirit and they were sealed to Doom they Embrace communist up to today says the prophet in this message if you want listen to God he will give you over to to Spirit that condemns you my brother let us listen to God drop your ideas drop your weaknesses embrace the word of God tell God just give me this chance today you be turned over to reprobate mind to believe lie and be damed by it the devil will take out of the message Church you go and believe believe and cost us lie you'll even allow your woman to go to preach and you are sealed forever because it failed because they fail to receive that Jubilee message of the baptism of the Holy Spirit brother bam says the Jubilee message of our time is the baptism of the Holy Spirit they were turn over to reprobate mind and they believe a lie and are damed amen Catholics rejected the word and God gave them toate mind and they believe dogmas and some of them are irredeemable today another rev took place in Turkey he said they rejected the Lord they even hung those people and up to today where are they but brother God don't look to denomination he looks to individuals are keep standing here Christianity is at denomination Christian is life and that is an individual life amen he says here someday thus says the Holy Spirit out of the word of God that America is in whole turning God down and will receive the mark of the beast according to Revelation 13 God is not a respect of a Nation it's not a respect of a people he want whatsoever will if one nation will Bloom and do all that is that and stand that Empire will last forever but every World Empire will be broken down at the coming of the lord The Rock heed out of the mountain Hallelujah he say but all the rest of the world will be broke and short to Pieces friends when you walk around here and these things that you get we wear good clothes best clothes okay was talking about but now listen except a man be born again of the spirit of God he will not see the kingdom of God and that was the warning subject of the Lord Jesus Christ but what I'm saying to you tonight be warned of the Gospel flee to Christ lay aside everything don't wait for Miss Jones don't wait for it to start in the church start in yourself right now for the time might come when God would point you to be a slave the rest of your life blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus this is what God is doing the most vital thing come to Jesus Christ every one of you know that someday you will be as SC and a pile of bones laying underneath some of this clay around here just as sure as you are sitting or as you are standing here tonight you are you are headed toward that that is right how sincere should you be then what you should get what I mean maybe you might start in an hour from now the next the next next year there may not be a piece of a flesh on your bone in the next 12 months that may not be a piece of h a peck of life in your body in the next 25 minutes and then from that time until endless age ceas to be will never be that state that you go in so if you are L one brother listen to me L one brother if you a look one brother if you're a look one sister that is dangerous place you could stand in a look condition Jesus said either be hot or cold either be for me with all your heart or be against me if you just live a pretty good life that will never count your self-righteousness is like filth rugs never stand in the day of judgment blessed be the name of the Lord you must get Christ here fast then them things will take place but you can do that without having Christ Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord the Jubilee trumpet has sounded it's up to us to embrace it I told you the devil has no right to hold you in any way he has no right brother the right which the devil has is because you have given him that right but this is the time to strive the devil naked blessed be the name of the Lord take every small right in this very message you need to read it yourself he say that the the thing for you to take is to know when Christ is in your heart when great trials and trouble comes on he is still sweet to you you will walk just the same if everything is going wrong everybody turned against you and everything turns against your way you will still still sweet and lovely and you you are Spirit bearing record with his spirit that you are Sons and Daughters of God blessed be the name of the Lord the Holy Spirit puts his Holiness in here it is his Holiness not mine I am a sinner but

birth Jesus gave it to you it's up you to receive blessed be the name of the Lord I was reading this and something came in my mind I was thinking about my sister uh sister seated there uh there is a sister who went to the meeting of brother Branham and brother Bram prayed for her and she believed for her healing she was blind girl and uh she started jubilating I'm Healed very happy and excited Jesus has Set Me Free why and when I'm say she was still blind as a bat but she had heard the sound of Jubilee my brother when the Jubilee sounded the sister had the trumpet amen these people around her never knew that she had had the trumpet when they still in the car she started screaming more say I can see the light there is someone who and pray for and told the person you will be well in 30 days blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah that caring God is here tonight in this very message one girl she was a blind girl and she went to the prophet no she she got lost I God lost from her so she was just moving anyhow people were gathering in thousands and they had called brother bam to go and pray for somebody who was in the ambulance and but when I'm say that person was dying of cancer and prayed for her and God brought her back to life so from there as he was trying to Doge find his way back to the pulpit he saw a girl coming like moving amidst the people let me tell you my brother deep cth unto the Deep when there is a deep calling unto the Deep there are no n forces in hell that can quench that thirst the only person who can quench that thirst is the Lord Jesus Christ the Fountain of Life oh there is how the Holy Spirit can work the Holy Spirit Led this girl to the right person whom she was looking for but I'm say when I look at her she had cataracts in her eyes and so brother bam started speaking to her and asking how can you see say I cannot see anything and then this girl then B I'm told ask her how did you come here then she say that when I heard all the news of a blind man who was healed I say I'm going here to be healed this girl had over the news and she told her dad take me there I'm going to receive my sight from there blessed be the name of the
