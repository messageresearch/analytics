looking for and the prophet jesus was slain yes she [Applause] uh when john saw jesus he said behold the lamb of god of the world hallelujah amen even before john had been praised jesus are you okay he had already proclaimed him as a lamb and when was the lamb slain in the book of revelations [Music] hallelujah he says and jesus was laying before the foundation of the world yes every person was that was saved was saved according to the bible when the lamb was slain in the mind of god you didn't get it did you get it hallelujah amen when was i saved be renault i was saved when the lamb was slain and when was the lamb slain yes before the foundation of the world i am not sad how do i know that i'm cold you were included in salvation hallelujah amen we ought to be shouting because of that today [Music] you were included in salvation so what are you going to do about it you got to teach you again the chick-fil-a because of his full knowledge needed to receive this life while what it is
