we go you can never lose any of us the Bible says that you have inscribed Us in the palm of your hand and also that you will lose no one father Lord even we understand those who are in sin and in the world Lord when they your children you can never lose them and they can never become the devil's children they are still your children and you will call each and every one of them and we ask oh God that if there is somebody here that has gone a little far away from you may you draw them to you tonight because you are the Father the loving father Lord even myself and my brother we are unworthy and we are just servants Lord we ask that you will come and use this body use these lips Lord cleans them and may you use them lord to bless your bride father what you would say may we say and what you don't say may we be silent give us inspiration and in the at the end that your children will be edified I pray for these who are here and those who are online Reach Out unto them Lord and lift them into your presence each one them Grant every need tonight we ask your blessings now as we are reading your word in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen uh I'd like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ um and good evening is it a good a good evening amen shall we turn to our Bibles um we are reading out of second Peter chapter one we are reading only one verse and then we shall be seated amen amen we are reading ver 10 wherefor the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things ye shall never fall [Music] [Music] amen you may be seated may the Lord bless us all tonight in his word amen uh we are so delighted once again to be in the presence of God being in his presence is more than being in the presence uh of the of the king or the president how many believe that and so I would like you to uh not only be here physically but I would like you to also be here your spirit soul and mind and um that way then the meeting and will be a blessing to us about what a preacher has organized to talk about it is also not about your coming but it is about his coming so when he comes then we are edified but you see he cannot come unless we are ready and willing to open up our hearts and receive [Music] him and the ministers also you know yield them so for God to use them that is how it happens and then it is a good service so our men are ready to open their hearts for speak them um I've preached on this subject here before yes um I'm not sure if it is years but I know many months ago but I've been speaking to a lot of young [Music] ministers and they kept on asking me things on this line and I thought maybe I should do the subject again the pattern of every true Ministry the pattern of every true Ministry it's all right if you have a better word you'll find it in the process but I think that is good enough so um we uh the scripture also says that um whosoever that shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved can you imagine whoever will call upon the name of the Lord but then he says how shall They Call On Him whom they have not believed and how shall they believe on him without a preacher and how shall the preacher preach except he be sent you understand so it's a sequence God sends a preacher you know and this preacher goes with a message from God and that message goes to edify the people the people believe the message and the people call on the name of the Lord and then they are saved um there is um last night I think it was last night I don't usually do that but uh somehow I was led to just click on on the summon that um uh pastor Ste preached and cuz I think I was attracted by the title and it was titled the body speaks and I listened to it and it was a masterpiece from the beginning to the end and I posted it on our church for him WhatsApp for him some people are very when they see two three [Music] hours but once again I had to say it here because I want to encourage everybody to go and listen to there's a lot of things that were said in there about the ministry about the the the gifts how God uses the gifts about how God speaks and uses people and about how people respond to that word and how they react towards the word and it was really so so good please go and listen to it and if you notice I've been talking so much about the soul um in the I just I was looking on the titles sometimes you know you give the titles subconsciously rather unconsciously so I first I was speaking on the bishop of our souls and then I spoke on concern for lost souls and then on Sunday Gathering Souls not building a denomination so it kind of feels that uh uh I noticed that there was a trend there that the holy spirit is trying to speak to us about the value of a soul and how to win souls so this evening because we have found out that you cannot win a soul unless you are sin so then how can we know a true Ministry how can you know that you are sent how can you know that what you are doing God is in it yes much of the Courts I'm going to read and the Scriptures it might seem that I'm only speaking on the preaching Ministry this applies to every single Ministry it might be the music Ministry and you are playing a certain instrument how can you be sure it is the will of God for you to play that instrument and also you might be singing you might be a special singer you might be a song leader you might be a deacon you might be a mother you might be a father you might be a preacher an evangelist a pastor or an apostle or whatever it is now some things if God has called you to know it is obvious you understand it you believe it but some other you you know gifts are even not so believable even for those that God has called them to fulfill them you know you will find someone and ask them what even for preachers like what is your what is your ministry and they don't know they're not too sure because but you see they believe they're called and because maybe they are also not some of them there I've seen a few Brothers I'm not too sure if I'm called into the ministry and then also some sometimes you attend in a church or in a service somewhere and you want to understand what is it a true Ministry is is it a true church for me to be a member of how can I know the kind of ministry to sit under so all those things is what we intend to answer in this uh sharing tonight now we started with this scripture which says give diligence to make your calling and election sure later on we will find out that the calling of God is without repentance if there is a gift upon your life or the calling of God upon your life he does you don't have to be a Christian first for you to realize you have it it is you born with it you called into it but you see in second Timothy 4:5 he says but watch thou in all things endure afflictions do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry so Paul was speaking to Timothy to prove his ministry now before I even continue I want to say this no man can call another into Ministry no man can give another a gift only God can give you that gift and only God can call you into the ministry but you see what man does God can actually use another man to help you mature into your ministry and he can use another man to Mentor you like God used Paul for Timothy and and you know they kept that's the pattern that's the way God works you can't just come from nowhere you know wherever you are you know God will put you under somebody do you know that even David himself having been anointed by God and called by God to be a king of Israel God somehow brought him under I I might say the word tutorship of soul [Music] he put him under soul and he was there for a long time and in he served in different capacities at one time he served as um a flute or whatever player instrument you know and whenever he did it demons left so you know at another time he was a general was a soldier you know at another time you know he served in different capacities when you find a man like Samuel Samuel served under El or but you see each of these was called by God the same God who called Ellie also called Samuel and they were both anointed by the same God just like the calling of Jeremiah when God calls you into Ministry he doesn't call you because he has see now you are born and you look so nice and he says this one may be a very good Minister and then he calls you into Ministry no God doesn't just look at you and say this one can make a good wife when she gets married not everybody is a mother at least not everyone has had that chance to be a mother or the opportunity but you see we are called into the Ministries when before the foundation of the world we are manifested here on Earth to show forth the glory of God through our lives you know and you know jermiah when he he he he rose up in the ranks and you know God called him he was still a little young of course and he said I am young and how can I go out and speak I am afraid of them and how they will not listen to me but when when God came down to speak to Jeremiah he said before you were in your mother's womb I called you I knew you I Sanctified you I anointed you do you understand what I'm talking about whatever you were meant to be whatever Ministry God wanted you to be in God already sanctioned you before you were even in your your mother's wom he only sets you under some people or some man or some woman or whatever it is to be able to mold your character that is why me I don't believe that these ministers who say I am the one who made him who who he is there is no Minister who can make you who you are Minister who can make me who I am it is only God who made me who I am it's only God who made you who you are but you see he uses a man in your life to mold your character praise the name of the Lord so that you can be able to step into your God called or God ordained Ministry and that is why humility is ke if you are not humble you cannot you cannot be able to walk into that Ministry to the extent that the Bible says if you are ordaining a minister or deacons he says it should not be someone it should not be a novice a noice it should not be young in the faith yes because if he's a novice you know the Bible says he will be puffed up with pride because you see he has not his character is not yet molded if you find that all great men a humble men all great people are humble people when you see someone trying to show or trying to fight to show that is somebody or something that just shows he's still you know young in whatever he's [Music] doing it shows he's still a nervous praise the name of the Lord okay I just did not prepare to read this I have a lot of scriptures to read but let us also read this in 1 Timothy chter 3 you know the word of God is so amazing friends vers six okay we can begin from um from verse one this is a truth saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desires a good work a bishop then must must be blameless a husband of one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality able to teach not given to Wine no strier not greedy of f laer but patient not a Brer not cous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity for if a man know know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God not a noice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil for you see the the Bible says not a noice not greedy filthy ler not cous one that knows how to rule his house and having his children under subjection having good behavior so a man a husband of one wife blameless patient not AER you see all these things are giving us a picture of how a bishop should be how a pastor should be how a preacher and Elder should be not someone you know you've done something and then automatically you know he wants to fight you you know because you know you've Hur him or done something you know you should be humble you should be uh calm but also he says you should not be a novice you see does God use novices yes but at a certain degree you see when God called David David stayed under that anointing before even he was anointed David was child trained by God in the bush [Music] and during that time you know a lion came to eat the sheep and you know he he got it and he killed it a bear came to eat the Sheep killed you see you might say well David was not someone asked me the question this evening why is it when Jess was asked by the prophet to bring out his children he did not bring David he brought all the other Sons but not David he left out David because David was the most unlikely candidate to be a king if God will ever make you anything big you will have to start small if if God will ever make anything big will have to start small small and despised Hallelujah never C amen what you see that others have their story is not your story my story is different my story is my story and what God is making out of me only God knows there it calls for me to be humble and grow through the process amen David was out there in the bush trying to raise the animals if someone came and told you that this young boy is going to be a king you couldn't believe it but God was molding character by the things that he suff out there and you know patience and resilience and longsuffering you know and and you know he was the character was molded in him and then time came for the anointing that was another now level and you see when the prophet came and told Jess one of your sons is going to be a king bring all of them here and Jess was did not even try even try to call David because David was unlikely to become a king did not know how to shave his hair even he he was smelling sheep he was just from the bush there and and you know he was you know rugged a rugged man but you see in him where the gifts of God him was the calling of God but it was just do waiting for manifestation Hallelujah when the time of God has come and when the time arrived for the anointing he wasn't even called it doesn't matter how man sees you it doesn't matter how man sees me it doesn't matter how they see our little church do you understand what I'm trying to say greatness comes from Small Things praise the name of the Lord you see we have a proverb in luganda that the things which become so booming the end of it all can come down you know whatever you want to H happen so fast will go so fast but if God is working in you a work you have to accept to go step by step grow one level from one level to another when all others are giving big testimonies don't be intimidated don't be intimidated because God is molding a great work in you and we see David AR at that time you know and they didn't even call him it doesn't matter whether they did not call to the table God himself by a Divine decree amen will bring you to the table it is not man to lift you brother it is not man or woman organization to lift it is God to lift you it is God to establish you it is God to call you to anoint you because he's the one who gifted you and anointed you and so we notice you know the prophet tried every one of them but God said no and until he went to the to ask Jesse don't you have another he said well I have a little another little one but he's a Bushman he's just a small small he said as long as is your child bring hallelujah hallelujah am I don't it doesn't matter how you are looked up but as long as you are amen a son a daughter of your father that blood is flowing through your veins Hallelujah there is something great in store for you every child of God is great because God is great Hallelujah and he was brought up and they anointed him now you would think after they anointed him immediately he will become a no God was still molding more character and you know they said you know they anointed him as a king but he was not yet a king you may not be a king yet but if you anointed as a king I say you are potentially a king and the Bible says you are Kings and Priests so I want to say this evening we are Kings also hallelujah amen your meal may be beans every day your meal may be potatoes and mushroom and vegetables why because you have no money in your pocket you may not have money right now hallelujah amen oh my enjoyed that sermon of brother Pastor he said you see New Testament Pro preacher is a prophet so right now I am prophesying to you I enjoyed that so much and I and I I identified with that because many times when preaching is going on literally it is the same anointing of a prophet because God gives you the knowledge to not and design the people's hearts until the preacher will preach exactly about you you be like what someone tell him no it is a prophetic utterance towards your life praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord hallelujah amen and so we see the life of David is a very good example for our ministry today and they anointed him to become a king you would think he would jump up he said I'm a king from today give me a p give me a p let me go and cut soul and remove him from my but he had patience he had patience he knew I am going to take that throne and I'm going to take that throne and the Bible says we are Kings and we are so right now your pockets may be empty am I preaching to someone am I prophesying to someone right now you may have nothing on your bank account and people may be laughing at you right now now you may not even have enough tution money you may not have anything to your name but if God said you are a king it is going to come to pass it is going to come to pass it may not happen immediately because God is preparing you for the throne you are about to assure Hallelujah and a person who has faith in God will not see his pocket right now but will see the anointing upon his head David could feel it I don't see the throne I don't see the Throne of a king but there is something I can see I see the anointing I see the word because the anointing is the same as the word and therefore in knew I am a king he behaved as a king he he was Brave even when it came to that giant he did not fear because he knew he is a king hallelujah amen some of you you need to start seeing the the the the the the the the things that God is taking you to that are given to you by the word of Prophecy Hallelujah am praise the name of the Lord you must begin to see your ministry you must begin to see your family you must begin to see your your job you must begin to see your business you must begin to see these things you see your multi million dollar Corporation I'm speaking for he that has seen it that knows is Anointed for it you must begin to see your children some of you are mothers you know God has anointed you to be a mother but no one has even said they're interested in you to marry you let me tell you we don't walk by sight we walk by faith I am one person who works by faith I usually plan things I have no idea on how I will accomplish it but I tell you what my brother my sister whatever God has ever told me will happen and I plan and I announce it I plan I announce I work towards it money comes in the process that is faith that is vision and it comes when you have an anointing upon your life hallelujah amen he has anointed my head with oil my cup run over you have to understand children of God are not like the rest in the world don't cry because you are no money don't cry because you are seeing no house no husband no wife no don't get depressed don't give up if you want a car just let God anoint you for it whatever you desire when the moment is right no one can stop it Hallelujah and David was anointed as a king but it took him more than 15 years for him to sit in that throne and he never killed soul to become a king some people have envy and greed when you know God has showed you something God told me I buy a car now this one has bought a car like the one I wanted I must bring them down I must bring them down because they taking my my place no one can take your blessing no one can take your place when God has called you into the work of ministry or any part of ministry no one can take your place you don't have to bring anybody down for you to go up brother bring up everybody lift up your brothers lift up your sisters respect each other honor each other because when you honor somebody God will bless you with what they have God will give you access to what they have David HED soul even when sa wanted to kill David but David still HED him he honed him but D but sa wanted to kill him but each time Saul tried to kill David David honed him he did not know every time every time David honored him the anointing upon it sa was coming upon David the anointing of the throne until God gave David favor even the son of Soul himself went on David's side Jonathan and he told him listen my father plans to kill you run for your life David did not want to run because he still wanted to serve do you know what I'm talking about if God will make you great you will serve regardless of what others are trying to do against you I don't serve because of man I don't Ser because of horor I serve because I have an anointing upon my life David served because of the anointing and God took Saul in battle and and and David took the throne gracefully can I prophesy to you tonight you sit on your throne gracefully Hallelujah am you will sit on your throne I said he will sit on your Thro no hell shall abound part of Darkness why because you are anointed for the ministry the ministry of a mother the ministry of a musician the ministry of a song leader the ministry of a deacon the ministry of a Preacher whatever God has called you to do even if it is serving man the B said do it as unto the Lord you have a job you serve God it's a Ministry make full proof of th Ministry Hallelujah if we knew these things we will not fight against other people who are doing things similar to ours I don't care how many people are doing things which look like what I'm they have their place in the economy of and if I honor them I lose nothing but I benefit everything Romans 124 for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in Christ and every one member of another having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us where the prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of Faith or Ministry let us wait on our ministering oh he that teacheth on teaching or he that exalteth on exaltation he that giveth let him do it with Simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness fore [Music] [Music] so you see the says we have members in one body all members had don't have the same office I'm a member of the body you are a member of the body none of us is greater than the other but each of us is important so we being many are one body in Christ and everyone members of one another you see sometimes when people hear a great testimony something that God did in some other person's Life Ministry they can't talk about it but when it is in their life they will talk about it everywhere you don't understand if the leg has one Victory the hand has won Victory if a testimony has happened in another church that believes this truth it is still my testimony if God has used another preacher in someone's life to do a great miracle to cause some good things to happen I can talk about it as as if I'm talking about my own Ministry because we are the same body but different members of the body and he says we have gifts def finding according to the grace according to the Grace that God has given to us where the prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith our ministry let us wait on our ministry and that includes you know music Ministry don't just come and say I'm just a musician you a minister you are a singer you a minister Sunday school teacher you a minister you a minister let us wait on our ministry let us wait on our ministering you don't have to just enter into your ministry without waiting upon the [Music] Lord if you're going to song Le go and pray wait upon just like a preacher praise and waits upon God you the med Department you don't have to just wait on the last minute and then begin running where is the camera you're bringing wrong spirits in the [Applause] church wait on your ministry it is a Ministry if you're going to play an instrument wait on your ministry don't just come on it with all the wrong Spirits you have been abusing yourselves with someone out there and then you come even un prayed you have not even forgiven them whenever you are playing you are put in those spirits of anger that's why noce even they broke something somewhere some in Anger a speed of anger and then if you're playing the guitar you just you remember what they said to you the string is bre what is it you have not waited upon your minist you are not in the spirit whether it is a piano or whatever instrument wait on your ministering whether you a Deon come and wait on it do you know as a Deon you can say one word to someone they may never come back to church but if you have been waiting upon God every word you speak God will give you favor with the people God will anoint your be a mother be a wife of somebody husband wait on your ministry we can expand that so big oh he that teaches let him wait let him wait on teaching he that EX on EX he that give even there are some who have a Ministry of help a Ministry give with Simplicity all right now we are going to help this person we helping him he did not have clothes now we about take we are not giv to him there is no simplic in your giving giving simplicity he that ruleth with diligence he that showeth Mercy with cheerfulness with cheerfulness now friends i' would like to having expanded that I want to show you in the message the Ephesian Church how God um showed us how to identify a true [Music] Ministry cuz we have many ministers doing the same thing but how can we know he that is true like God ordained uhhuh that's what I want us to go through now how can you know that what you're doing God is in it how can you know God is blessing your ministry threefold quality of a true [Music] Ministry quality okay now he says I'll just read for you it says Paul founded the church at Ephesus about the middle of the first century this en has to set the date of the beginning of the Ephesian Church age to about 53 ad his manner of ministering set the pattern that all future Messengers were to Aspire and actually it says the pattern for every true minister of God the pattern that Paul was ministering in it helped brother bam actually to understand the other Church Messengers after Paul they had to follow the same pattern and also he says not only in the generations the ages also to every true Minister though he would not attain to such Heights in the prophetic realm as did Paul but they would actually have to be in that same pattern's Ministry had a three-fold quality and was as follows number one first of all Paul was absolutely true to the word tell your neighbor he was true to the word he never deviated from it no matter what the cost if you want to know whether what you're doing God is with you whether it's a true Ministry you will have to be true to the word you will not deviate from this word you will not have some practices that are antib to be antib is to be against Christ and to be against Christ is to be Antichrist actually by the way this is what sets us apart from all denominations because for us as Believers of this message we are pro Bible we word if something God never said it we don't believe it and but if God said it we believe it and that settles it that those are message Believers and every true Minister will be absolutely not somehow hey not somehow true to the word he will be absolutely true to the world don't follow someone because there is the miraculous in their Ministry that is not the only Vindication true of God don't follow someone because because they have a big church that is not the Vindication only what vindicates someone to be a true Minister he will be true to the word how he teaches what he teaches how he behaves he will be according to the word now he may be having a huge charge 10,000 people and they all listening to him but if he accepts women preachers he believes in three Gods instead of one he's a false preacher simply put if he he rejects the Holy Spirit he refuses he he rejects tongues interation of and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost he's a false preacher you identify a preacher by him being true to the word he never deviated Paul never deviated from the word no matter he will be ready to die for the word by the way let me tell you a preacher who is not ready to die for what is stands for is not a [Music] preacher I am ready to die for this truth I am ready and I'm not trying to make you radical I'm telling you the truth the disciples all died for this truth I remember when I was in China to cature their preaching is a death sentence and I was preaching in an underground church somewhere on a floor high high high think it was about 15 something and someone just came and knocked the Brethren said they have called us everybody in one in just about 3 seconds they HIIT their Bibles it is only me who was left with M and I'm a foreigner everybody freezed I talked to my interor I said what is wrong he said if the are the law enforcers then they going to arrest you I said what happens usually said this sentence I sweated that's the truth but as I was wondering what I should do in that moment should I also hide my my Bible should I run can you run off in a 15 15 story building I was desperate and then a thought just came to me now I knew why the Believers accepted to die for this truth a thought came to me preach if the interpr refuses to interet continue preaching let them find find you and catch you preaching and at least you would have died for the truth so I told the brother can we Contin preaching he said yes we can he also became so ragged I love that brother and and someone went to open with were preaching and the g increased I was ready to die and then when he opened the door he opened went out and then came back the the brother was doing like this he said like this so we contined preaching time I thought someone is coming at the end of it all I was told that they found nobody outside they don't know what happened but brother that was a test of my faith what you believe if you can't be ready to die for it you don't believe it you're just kidding we must be ready to give our neck for this why because Jesus gave his name for us hallelujah hallelujah we must be true to the word we must never compromise the word regardless we don't want to be the kind of preacher that comes and says I apologize I no longer believe this I apologize I made mistakes here no wonder Paul said to Timothy study don't just preach stud fast even to you brothers who are going in homes of Believers preaching don't just go there to speak your mind eat the word eat the message don't talk about something until you are sure about it what does the Bible say what does the prophet say if you don't know you ask your pastor and if he doesn't know you will ask the prophet hallelujah hallelujah Paul said though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than which we have preached unto you let him be a cast said before so I said now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received let him be a cast Paul was true to the word he was saying even if an angel comes from Heaven he cannot remove this message he cannot change the word the word we are preaching is unchangeable unchangeable No Angel can change it no man can change it Galatians 2:1 says but when Peter was come to Antioch I with him to the face because he was to be blamed but when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the Gospel I say to Peter before them all if thou being a Jew live in the manner of the Gentiles and not as the Jews why do you compare the Gentiles to live as the Jews you see the words of Paul he was true to the world he was a bold man he was not a ass somebody who cified having no strength and boldness to stand for the truth we must be able to stand for the I met this Pentecostal preacher he just stored my house yesterday and um an old friend and so I he told me these things I gave this magazine you gave me to some of my fellow Bishops and they know better than I he's a theologian you know so he said they would maybe want you to come and explain to them better many times they think these Bishops actually the higher Bishops usually do that to to to they send them say okay now tell them to come and meet us we shall we so I told him they think they are going to correct us this is what I'm thinking now but actually we are going to show them the truth to us it is an opportunity it is an opportunity so I said wow I am waiting I'm ready I'm available when you want us to go he was so shocked and I was so happy to go I then added my brother the words I'm speaking to you I did not learn them from a Bible colle the message we are preaching to you is not a theological message it is taugh by the Holy Ghost God sent a prophet with a message which is the direct to the Bible and he has confirmed it to us by the Holy Ghost this is the Holy Ghost message Hallelujah the end time message is not another idea it's not a somebody's Doctrine this is more than a church doctrine it is more than religion this is that say the Lord and when God confirms it to somebody's you are going to be on fire they will tell you we want to meet you we want you to meet our Arch Bishop take me take me I tell them take me one time someone sent me sent one someone sent me a picture you know in the in the don't remember which year but he preached on salmon and it are greater than Solomon is here and there's another salmon there he preached the queen of shba so now brother preached those sermons in the 60s I believe and so we know it we've read it we've heard it talks about the wisdom of Solomon and everything and then Christ and the queen of cand things and and the types so so Apostle Grace put up a sign post and if you ask me I'll send it you I'll look for it and it was having an invitation for the people like the the ones they met greater than Solomon is here and you know there was another title there the Queen of Sheba inv inviting the people to come that message his message I was so full of jealous I said these men they read the message that is a good thing but they are reading it with aeve they pick some things and they leave others and even what they have picked they claim it is their personal re they don't refer to where the source is because they afraid the people will leave them when they realize where the truth is the person who sent me that picture was a member of that church who believed the message when they had Apostle Grace talking about brother Bram and they went and searched who William and they saw the message and finally they were led to us we baptized them and that's how now they desired the message simply because of one a man mentioned they think they're mentioning the name and they end up saying he ended up being a false prophet but the seed can't be deceived when they get into it and they read for themselves and they hear for themselves they say this is the word now this is the truth this is the word so I was so full of jealous for the word I said let me go and face this man sometimes I can behave a bit unruly let me go I took the church age book I took the message I took the queen of she I said I'm going to him so I drove to his office not so far from here and uh unfortunately when I reached there I was thought oh he has gone for holiday but I was welcomed properly and you know given place and I said I'll come back I never failed to go back they know the truth but they rejected it they replaced they take the truth and apply their their Theology and apply other things regardless of how well they soft or well spoken it doesn't make them to preachers why because they are not true to the word where someone comes and explains to you that a woman can be a preacher that you know we are no longer in the Old Testament the Bible did not say that we preachers women should not preach because of the law this is something that came before the law you read in the Book of Genesis you and you'll also find it again in the book of First Timothy what was the reason the woman was having the opportunity and ability also to teach the word and she was a Bible teacher and she taught the word to The Serpent and word came out of it she added on the word and because of adding on the word the devil took away the woman said God said you should not eat or touch it God never said don't touch it God said don't eat it because she added that part the devil became excited he also said in that yes God knew you will become wise like him but don't worry you will not die that was an addition when the devil added the Eve's heart was worn she was deceived and in the book of second Timothy before we go to I mean before we go to First Timothy right there in Genesis when God came down he said now woman because of what you have done two things were added to her number one that you will be ruled over your desire shall be upon your husband he shall rule over you and you will you will have pain in child birth even the grace of Jesus and the death of Jesus on the cross does not take away that that's why even Believers women who are believers and filled with the Holy Ghost they have pain in child even sah who was a holy ghost fed woman she called her husband my Lord she knows he's ruling over me that did not change it is the word and the word of God cannot be changed you cannot do it and that's why in the New Testament When God Says women should not be allowed to teach author over man I want you to watch the reason he gave in the book of second rather 1 Timothy chter 2: 11 let the woman learn in Silence with all subjection but I suffer not a woman to teach nor to ass Ser authority over the man but to be in [Music] [Music] silence and he gives the reasons now for Adam was first formed than Eve second reason and Adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so you see the Bible cannot contradict itself this is the new test this is the New Testament and it was not because of the law that a woman was stopped from [Music] preaching no it was not it was the word of God before the law and the word of God is forever settled where in is the same yesterday today and forever but our sisters who are saved the Bible says they shall be saved in childbearing if they continue in faith God has promised that they will not die or suffer or you know have all these complications in child birth but because they don't believe they don't continue many soal Christian women they don't continue in faith they go for this kind of you know modern civilized bath control stuff they have the complications but if they were to continue in faith to believe the God given way they will give birth like Hebrew women it is the promise of the world praise the name of the Lord and so you cannot make the word contradict of course women can teach older women can teach younger women and they can also preach to Sunday school children that because the Bible allows them to teach children and I always say if a sister feels she has a calling upon her life we want her to come and a preacher to the Sunday School just like you teach your children at home and and you younger sisters if the older sisters come to teach you don't begin becoming proud the Bible says they are teachers of good they teach you how to love your husbands they teach how to to love your children how to to be a home maker this is in the book of Titus Chapter one which means you don't know you have to be taught and you older sisters that's your responsibility all these weddings we have since that's not a pastor's job you you older sisters it is your job to go to this new and You Begin teaching them how to love their husbands how to be hakers how to love their children how to do all these things what the Bible says praise the name of the Lord can we read it praise the name of the Lord uhuh chapter two of Titus it says aged women verse three likewise that they be in Behavior as becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good [Music] things so you see they aged how are they aged I may not think that in age like in many years I would think aged in the Lord and also of course in age that they may teach the young women to be sober to love their husbands so you younger women you don't know how to love your husbands they should teach you yes the B says they should teach you okay they are not here God bless you Sister I know you watch sister f we have one here who recently got married you should accept they teach you how to love your you don't know you don't know it's not my words it's the words of the bible let them teach you how to be sober so which means you're not sober many times because you are young and un learned you young sister hey I had forgotten this is about to get married they should teach you how to be sober when they come and teach you don't begin pulling your no who you should to tell me no humble yourself and accept to be T to love their husbands you don't even know how to do it to love their children you see when sisters are young sometimes they don't even know how to love their children how cuz a child how can a child be loved not that the mother doesn't have the motherly love talking about the care because you do not know how to do it you find because the mother has children everywhere so the older sisters have to come sister can't you see you SM and you sisters when you you come to this younger sister don't be sweet be direct sister you're [Applause] smelling you have to use diapers so if I I don't have diapers I don't have I don't know how to okay I'll show you how to you understand it's a work not of a pastor it's a work of a older sister this is the work SS you see now the child is crying now child is crying in the church this sister just what is wrong with you sister this child is crying because it is hungry don't just slap slap no no stubborn child the child is angry always serve the child before the preaching so that they can be calm in the child thank you you just told her how to love her children teach them to be discreet vers five what does it say to be discreet to be just you see some of these young married sisters they don't know they are married you find them behaving as if they are not married brother pull her aside sister you have to be discret you are now married you are someone's wife you represent something you old sisters don't see those things and walk away teach them teach them to be chest not just to allow people to touch touch them out in immorality and things like that they should be told to be Church keepers at home some of these younger sisters don't want to stay at home me when I was at my father's house I was moving around the way I wanted mother come to this sister teacher you are now married you must be a keeper at home is it my thoughts is the thoughts of the word you must be Tau to stay put to be good to be obedient to your own husbands all these things have to be told you obedient to your husbands and also that the word of God may not be Blas praise the name of the Lord so you see we believe in women preachers of that kind they shouldn't be allowed to come in the church on the pull pit and begin to teach men that is not allowed in all churches of the Saints if a church is allowing it that is not a church or a Ministry that is true to the word regardless of how many things are happening or how big they are they have to be true to the word praise the name of the Lord I think I have to stop here because if I continue I I cannot finish because I have about one hour suon to talk about this is a a good subject it's a good subject I think we have to stop that because our time is I'm sorry God bless you the pattern of every true Ministry I would see when next God to give me Grace to continue on that subject praise the Lord are not so happy because of this precious message it has open our eyes not to be deceived to
