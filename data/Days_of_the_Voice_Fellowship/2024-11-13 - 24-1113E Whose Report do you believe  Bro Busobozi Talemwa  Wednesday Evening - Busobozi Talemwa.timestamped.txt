[43:20] the land after 40 days and they went and
[43:23] came to Moses and to Aaron and to all
[43:25] the congregation of the children of
[43:26] Israel
[43:27] andto the Wilderness of Paran to Kadesh
[43:31] and brought back word unto them and unto
[43:33] all the congregation and showed them the
[43:35] fruit of their land and they told him
[43:38] and and and they
[43:41] said we came unto the land with thou
[43:44] sentest us and surely
[43:46] it floweth with milk and honey and there
[43:50] is the fruit of it sorry and this is the
[43:53] fruit of it nevertheless the people be
[43:55] strong that dwell in the land and the
[43:58] cities are W and very great and moreover
[44:01] we saw the children of anak there the
[44:04] aites dwell in the land of the South and
[44:07] the Hittites and the jeites and the
[44:09] amorites dwell in the mountains and the
[44:11] Canaanites dwell by the Sea and by the
[44:13] coast of Jordan and calb stealed the
[44:16] people before Moses and said let us go
[44:20] up at once and possess it for we are
[44:23] well able to overcome it but the men
[44:26] that went up with him said we be not
[44:28] able to go up against the the people for
[44:31] they are stronger than we and and they
[44:33] brought up an evil report of the land
[44:36] which they had searched unto the
[44:38] children of Israel saying the land
[44:40] through which we have gone to search it
[44:43] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[44:45] thereof and all the people that as that
[44:48] we saw in it are men of a great stature
[44:53] and there were and there we saw the
[44:56] Giant
[44:58] the son of anak which come of the Giants
[45:02] and were in our own sight as
[45:05] Grasshoppers and we were in our own
[45:08] sight as gr hopers and so we were in
[45:11] their
[45:25] sight
[45:46] [Music]

[46:25] for fore
[46:59] [Music]
[47:05] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[47:07] bless
[47:11] them I I usually on Wednesday
[47:16] evenings since we are not covering the
[47:18] whole
[47:21] place I always appreciate Brethren if we
[47:24] could use these two rows
[47:30] uh so that we can be able to um see each
[47:33] other
[47:37] properly thank
[47:43] you uh receive greetings from

[47:48] chair over over
[47:51] here I don't know some of these single
[47:53] Brothers they fear to sit in front
[47:59] you should always I don't know why
[48:01] people always fear front
[48:04] seats and they take their back
[48:07] seats where do you want to be in
[48:10] heaven in the back or in the
[48:13] front I think you should begin
[48:15] practicing
[48:18] When Praise the Lord please receive
[48:21] greetings from sister uh uh Dina
[48:28] many times I forget to bring her
[48:31] greetings I know she probably is online
[48:34] as
[48:35] well so we send her our greetings as
[48:40] well amen this
[48:43] Sunday this past Sunday we had two
[48:48] baptisms and the first um the one is a
[48:53] sister sister that lives with the the
[49:00] theondes she's her parents are
[49:03] Muslims she was
[49:05] afraid um initially she
[49:08] decided and then later on she came and
[49:10] said uh mother has threatened
[49:14] me and said I cannot leave
[49:18] Islam gave a few
[49:20] threats and uh so she came Pastor said
[49:23] pastor what can I
[49:25] do I said well this is a personal
[49:29] decision and if you still want to make a
[49:32] decision no amount of
[49:35] [Music]
[49:37] threats be accomplished in your life
[49:41] because once you have received Jesus
[49:43] Christ he is there to protect
[49:46] you and um so she said it's all right
[49:49] I'm going to make up my
[49:51] mind so this
[49:53] Sunday she again said now I'm feeling a
[49:56] lot of fear

[50:06] witness through throughout the whole
[50:09] process if you gather enough strength

[50:50] them go there and go with your
[50:53] friends take your neighbor

[51:05] neighborhood do we say Amen to that so
[51:08] please don't give up on your home
[51:11] sales it is a must for every believer to

[51:29] concerned about taking someone
[51:33] else can I hear an Amen on
[51:36] that amen and so um our sister then was

[51:50] lady when this sister came
[51:52] out this young lady also said I'm also
[51:56] ready
[51:59] I've gathered enough
[52:01] strength and boldness and she was also
[52:04] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[52:07] Christ and we say glory to
[52:10] God Amen and so uh this
[52:14] evening by the grace of God I'd like to
[52:16] speak to you on a
[52:20] question whose report do you
[52:24] believe ask your neighbor whose report
[52:26] do you
[52:29] believe whose report do you
[52:32] believe that I have started my
[52:35] business and it's not um according to
[52:38] what everybody is
[52:40] saying it is not going to work
[52:43] out whose report do you
[52:47] believe that we are collecting our land
[52:50] fund and it's going to be impossible for
[52:52] us to buy the
[52:54] land whose report do you believe
[52:58] that these days it is impossible to find
[53:00] a
[53:01] job whose report do you
[53:04] believe that I am sick and the doctor is
[53:07] saying my situation is
[53:11] impossible the question is still the
[53:13] same whose report do you
[53:16] believe so that's the question I want us
[53:18] to talk about
[53:19] tonight no matter what situation we are
[53:21] going
[53:22] through you know they are saying that
[53:25] you know inflation and the economy
[53:29] and things are
[53:32] difficult things can't work out whose
[53:35] report do we
[53:38] believe I want to say I want to believe
[53:41] the report of the
[53:44] Lord and um so this evening I'd like to
[53:47] take it as of we've read out of the book
[53:50] of
[53:53] numbers and um here this this is when
[53:57] the the the the spies have come back to
[54:01] to Israel to uh back to the
[54:08] desert back to the camp of
[54:12] Israelites and they they searched they
[54:15] had searched the land for 40
[54:20] days because as you know God had
[54:22] promised them a
[54:24] land flowing with milk and
[54:28] honey and you know when God gives a
[54:30] promise his promise is always something
[54:33] that will come to
[54:38] pass the promises of God cannot
[54:42] change time
[54:44] changes seasons change people change but
[54:48] the promises of God do not
[54:51] change but many times we get discouraged
[54:54] and disappointed
[54:57] when things change and we think because
[55:00] things have
[55:01] changed there also God is promises have
[55:06] changed God's promises concerning our
[55:10] life now I believe that this word of
[55:14] God is for an
[55:16] individual it is for everyone but it is
[55:20] supposed to be received for by an
[55:23] individual and it's supposed to be
[55:25] applied to each life
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] individually and if God is in
[55:32] heaven then every promise has given in
[55:34] his
[55:36] word concerning my
[55:38] situation concerning my life must be
[55:43] accomplished whether it is by word of
[55:46] Prophecy whether it is by
[55:48] scripture whether it is by you know the
[55:51] spoken
[55:52] word every promise of God is true
[55:56] and he says his word is forever settled
[56:00] in
[56:02] heaven let me tell you a little thing
[56:04] about God when God thinks
[56:08] something and he says
[56:10] it that thing is already
[56:13] done no matter how long it will
[56:16] take no matter how difficult it will
[56:20] seem you know seasons will change times
[56:24] will change
[56:26] word of God it was fulfilled the moment
[56:30] it was
[56:32] spoken even before we have seen
[56:35] it if God says if you are
[56:38] baren and God says you will have a
[56:41] child you know it is as good as
[56:44] done you know if God says I'll give you
[56:47] a job it is as good as done the moment
[56:51] he promises it you should begin
[56:54] rejoicing
[56:57] not when it has been
[56:59] accom but the moment he says it that is
[57:03] why when we come to church we Rejoice at
[57:06] the hearing of the
[57:08] word because as we are hearing the word
[57:11] and it becomes the r words to
[57:15] us it becomes
[57:17] personal it is revealed to
[57:22] you yes you know you get excited and it
[57:26] becomes
[57:27] personal it hits you
[57:30] hard you know that's why sometimes
[57:32] people fall
[57:33] down by hearing the word why because it
[57:36] has become personal
[57:38] to you know that moment it has become
[57:42] personal to you it is
[57:48] fulfilled that's why you should always
[57:50] receive it and excuse me punctuate it
[57:53] with an amen
[57:56] the moment it is
[57:58] spoken and so tonight we are going to
[58:01] hear the word of
[58:03] God not my words the word of God I want
[58:07] to hear the word of the Lord for
[58:09] me amen and so when you hear it don't
[58:13] hear it as some pre
[58:16] money hear it as a personal word from
[58:19] God to
[58:22] you and when it comes it comes to
[58:27] it comes to do a work it cannot return
[58:31] unto him
[58:33] void it it fulfills the purpose it has
[58:36] been sent to
[58:39] do now I believe those things with all
[58:41] my
[58:44] heart and so now we see the word of God
[58:48] is the perfect
[58:51] report and that is what a Believer
[58:54] believes
[58:56] who are we we are believers Believers of
[59:00] what Believers of God's
[59:04] report how many to hear his
[59:08] report we are now
[59:10] set we want to hear the
[59:13] report of the Holy Spirit concerning our
[59:17] lives praise the name of the Lord amen
[59:21] amen imagine if someone told you that
[59:24] here is a letter
[59:26] God has sent you some
[59:29] words how do you feel even before you
[59:33] open it you already smiling so I don't
[59:36] want to see any gloomy face
[59:38] tonight I want to see you happy I don't
[59:42] want to see you sitting and
[59:43] relaxing I want you to sit on the edge
[59:46] of your
[59:47] seat be ready to hear the
[59:50] report concerning your
[59:52] life from the Lord I already feel happy
[59:57] hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and so
[1:00:02] God spoke to
[1:00:04] Israel as we will see later on and he
[1:00:08] gives them um a
[1:00:10] promise and he says I'll give you a
[1:00:13] land and this land will flow with will
[1:00:16] be is Flowing with milk
[1:00:19] and and so Moses sends them out these
[1:00:23] people to go and spy on the land
[1:00:28] and um you know these men go out and spy
[1:00:30] the
[1:00:31] land and after spying the land for 40
[1:00:35] days they came back to Moses and to
[1:00:38] Aaron and to the congregation of the
[1:00:40] children of Israel and they found them
[1:00:42] in the
[1:00:43] wilderness or
[1:00:45] par and so they brought back the
[1:00:48] word they brought back
[1:00:50] report concerning the land who promised
[1:00:54] the land
[1:00:56] God
[1:00:57] promised now I want you to I want to say

[1:01:15] reporting good
[1:01:17] things about the land good things about
[1:01:22] the
[1:01:23] promises you know this word is filled
[1:01:25] with good
[1:01:27] things that God is going to do for
[1:01:30] us this is not a set of rules and don't

[1:01:47] promises of
[1:01:48] God concerning what he said he will do
[1:01:51] for
[1:01:54] us and so beware
[1:01:56] of men who bring a false
[1:01:59] report but tonight we want to see to
[1:02:02] hear a good
[1:02:04] report and the children of Israel they
[1:02:07] were ready and waiting to hear the word
[1:02:09] that these people
[1:02:11] brought and these men they saw the land
[1:02:16] and they even brought the fruit of the
[1:02:18] land and they told him to Moses we came
[1:02:23] to the land where you sent us
[1:02:27] surely surely it is Flowing with milk
[1:02:31] and
[1:02:34] honey it is Flowing with milk and

[1:03:27] purpose let me tell you the
[1:03:30] purpose amen the land is Flowing with
[1:03:34] milk and
[1:03:35] honey the purpose of God is to take you
[1:03:38] to that land the promises of God are
[1:03:42] good God has no Grievous promise for any
[1:03:45] of his
[1:03:48] children
[1:03:52] they us to to snakes and all
[1:03:56] Scorpion and such there is nothing like
[1:03:58] that we say scorpions will eat you by
[1:04:00] the
[1:04:02] day and the snakes will eat you by the
[1:04:05] night no there is no promise like that
[1:04:08] but those things will come in the
[1:04:11] process but when they come do not look
[1:04:14] on them and forget the
[1:04:18] promise do not look on your
[1:04:21] situation and judge
[1:04:23] yourself on the basis of your situ
[1:04:30] there is no permanent
[1:04:33] situation every situation must change
[1:04:37] but it will change according to your
[1:04:41] faith and we will see here two groups of
[1:04:45] people you know if you have no faith
[1:04:49] even if you are in the middle of God's
[1:04:52] promises you will fail to receive it
[1:04:56] rather it is very sad for you to be in
[1:04:59] the middle of the
[1:05:01] promises and you fail to receive it
[1:05:04] because of lack of
[1:05:06] faith these men went the Bible says they
[1:05:09] even PL the
[1:05:11] fruits I am sure they ate some of
[1:05:14] it and They
[1:05:16] Carried some of these fruits back again
[1:05:19] to the
[1:05:21] people so they said the land where you
[1:05:24] sent us to
[1:05:26] sure it is there sure it is Flowing with
[1:05:29] milk and
[1:05:30] honey and here is the

[1:10:15] something that God takes care
[1:10:18] of and I tell you what it takes care of
[1:10:21] God takes care of his seed

[1:10:58] saying hear the words of the holy spirit
[1:11:01] that to you God has given you a certain
[1:11:05] land but on that Land There is a
[1:11:09] site there is
[1:11:11] aite there is a
[1:11:13] perite there is an
[1:11:15] Amorite there is a are you
[1:11:18] hearing the place the land that God has
[1:11:21] given
[1:11:22] you is already occupied
[1:11:26] they is still needing some battle
[1:11:29] battling to
[1:11:31] do that's why we battle as
[1:11:34] Believers we are not going to receive
[1:11:36] our breakthrough without
[1:11:39] fighting you have to fight to
[1:11:43] win whatever God has promised to you
[1:11:47] will surely come to you but you need to
[1:11:50] hold your
[1:11:51] ground you need to have a back bone to
[1:11:54] say God said it I believe it it must
[1:12:00] happen nothing can stop
[1:12:03] it let me tell you that Believers have
[1:12:06] no
[1:12:08] backone many times to stand for what the
[1:12:11] word of God
[1:12:13] says stand for what the word of God
[1:12:17] says God is somebody that fulfills his
[1:12:22] word we have not come to him
[1:12:26] to check whether or not he will fail us
[1:12:30] he says in his word I will never fail
[1:12:33] you I will never forsake you his word
[1:12:37] cannot
[1:12:39] fail just like there is a
[1:12:42] heaven just like it is you that's how
[1:12:45] God's word is whatever he has said he
[1:12:49] will accomplish it it will not come
[1:12:52] easy you have to fight for what belongs
[1:12:59] amen Israel was
[1:13:02] promised alar by the Lord the creator of
[1:13:05] Heaven and
[1:13:08] Earth amen as I speak of Israel I wanted
[1:13:11] to be thinking of
[1:13:13] yourself they did not fully possess that
[1:13:18] land I want you to imagine until today
[1:13:22] that land they don't geographically
[1:13:25] cover it
[1:13:28] all they only have fractions of
[1:13:31] it that's how you are many times you are
[1:13:35] living under
[1:13:38] privileged to to be able for them to
[1:13:40] occupy all the
[1:13:43] land they cannot do it without
[1:13:47] War they need to
[1:13:49] fight in order to possess every
[1:13:52] inch even if they went not to
[1:13:56] Lebanon and they said we want one
[1:13:59] kilm there will be a huge
[1:14:02] wall but you see Israel has always
[1:14:06] fought for their
[1:14:09] plan but even until now they don't have
[1:14:12] the whole
[1:14:13] land they don't control the whole land
[1:14:17] oh it is so
[1:14:18] sad many Believers also don't have all
[1:14:22] the promises that God promised in his
[1:14:24] word
[1:14:26] in the time of Joshua they possessed a
[1:14:29] big chunk of
[1:14:30] it in the time of David and
[1:14:32] Solomon they controlled all the
[1:14:35] land but for a small
[1:14:38] time and then soon they were
[1:14:41] exiled and and you know they've been
[1:14:44] exiled I wanted to get you some maps but
[1:14:46] I didn't have the enough time to gather
[1:14:48] those
[1:14:50] Maps since they have been exiled
[1:14:53] multiple times
[1:14:57] and and each time they have been
[1:15:01] exiled they always came back to their
[1:15:04] land they claimed their
[1:15:07] land they never let their land go
[1:15:11] permanently Israel is the only country
[1:15:13] on
[1:15:15] Earth they the only people on
[1:15:18] Earth who sees to be a
[1:15:23] nation and they were dispers from their
[1:15:26] land and they
[1:15:28] reappeared because of what God
[1:15:31] promised God said I've given you this
[1:15:34] life it will be yours forever and ever
[1:15:37] and ever and
[1:15:39] ever no one will ever take it from you
[1:15:42] in
[1:15:44] 1903 the Jews rejected a
[1:15:48] proposal which was given by Joseph
[1:15:52] chamberline chamberline a British you
[1:15:55] know this proposal was given and it was
[1:15:58] told them that they should actually make
[1:16:02] Uganda
[1:16:10] Homeland they were given
[1:16:12] Uganda and you know Uganda is
[1:16:15] beautiful I would say it is Flowing with
[1:16:17] milk and
[1:16:19] honey it is in the great
[1:16:23] region this is where you have rivers and
[1:16:25] lakes
[1:16:27] and it's green all through the
[1:16:30] year actually when you drive out the
[1:16:33] other time I was in h and I was driving
[1:16:34] throughout I was like
[1:16:36] my Uganda is really
[1:16:39] beautiful you go to the north you go to
[1:16:42] the east to the South Uganda is
[1:16:45] beautiful honestly speaking I have
[1:16:48] personally not seen in all the countries
[1:16:50] of been around the
[1:16:52] world and I'm saying this truthfully
[1:16:55] I've not seen a country as beautiful as
[1:16:58] Uganda fuits
[1:17:01] everywhere you know the temperature
[1:17:04] here is not very hot not very cold so
[1:17:09] it's really moderate it's acceptable so
[1:17:13] you find that um you don't need to you
[1:17:15] don't need to you can live without
[1:17:19] SC some countries you can't leave
[1:17:24] if you have no air
[1:17:26] conditioning you
[1:17:29] die in China you can basically you
[1:17:33] cannot you will
[1:17:35] faint they have all these air
[1:17:38] conditioning
[1:17:38] in because it can really beot
[1:17:42] them but you see
[1:17:44] Uganda in in in Germany and all these
[1:17:47] European countries they have to
[1:17:51] insulate when you are building a house
[1:17:54] you have to insulate it on the on the
[1:17:56] ground in the
[1:18:01] walls
[1:18:03] heat because when it's cold it's really
[1:18:07] cold and you can't live in the house
[1:18:09] without that
[1:18:11] woman and even you need to have those
[1:18:14] jackets but in Uganda you just go and
[1:18:17] get your
[1:18:22] reads and you get you you just get your
[1:18:25] water and soil and
[1:18:28] mix and you put it you get all banana
[1:18:31] fibers you tie on
[1:18:33] the and you get that mixed you know
[1:18:37] soil and clay and whatever you make a
[1:18:42] house and you
[1:18:44] sleep Uganda is beautiful tell your
[1:18:47] neighbor Uganda is
[1:18:50] beautiful praise the Lord that's the
[1:18:53] truth that's the truth
[1:18:55] and so you notice that you know
[1:18:57] chamberline wanted to give the Jewish um
[1:19:01] State the land of
[1:19:05] Uganda you know these people they had
[1:19:07] colonized
[1:19:09] us and so they they they thought they
[1:19:12] can always give this land to the other
[1:19:16] one because they colonized
[1:19:19] us but the Jews refused they said we
[1:19:23] want our Liv
[1:19:26] in
[1:19:28] 1948 Israel returned again to their
[1:19:34] homeland in
[1:19:36] Palestine and they have had many
[1:19:39] wars but each of them has been a war for
[1:19:45] survival Israel has never waged a war on
[1:19:48] any
[1:19:51] country just without uh uh any
[1:19:56] reason and the reason has always been
[1:19:59] for their
[1:20:02] surviv it has been a war for their
[1:20:05] land you talk about land
[1:20:07] Grabbers and people who fight for land
[1:20:10] and kill each
[1:20:11] other the real for our land is in
[1:20:15] Israel even now as I'm
[1:20:18] speaking the war for their land is going
[1:20:20] on now now
[1:20:22] now their war with Iran and
[1:20:26] H leanon the in and all it is all
[1:20:32] because of their
[1:20:34] land to them the promise of God for
[1:20:39] their land is n
[1:20:44] debatable they believe only one
[1:20:48] report they believe only God is
[1:20:52] report hallelujah amen many times their
[1:20:56] fought Wars on many fronts at the same
[1:21:02] time imagine Uganda being attacked by
[1:21:06] Sudan and Kenya con and
[1:21:10] Randa Bui and all at the same time if we
[1:21:15] were attack I don't know whether we
[1:21:16] would
[1:21:18] survive but Israel has been at even now
[1:21:21] as I speak on seven fronts
[1:21:28] here they sending
[1:21:31] InterContinental sending these the
[1:21:33] S but you see Israel has breast for all
[1:21:37] of
[1:21:38] them and they saying we are not leaving
[1:21:41] this
[1:21:42] ground we die we die but we are not

[1:21:51] life we shall not be moved
[1:21:55] we are going to stay here and we shall
[1:21:58] win all these battles and their claim is
[1:22:01] one because God
[1:22:04] promised that's their only
[1:22:07] claim that's their only
[1:22:09] report they holding on to they saying
[1:22:13] because God
[1:22:15] promised Our Land
[1:22:18] Title is in the
[1:22:21] Bible that is what they saying
[1:22:25] title is with God he gave it to Abraham
[1:22:30] our and here we stay here we die but we
[1:22:35] shall not be
[1:22:37] moved oh I love that kind of
[1:22:40] thing believing the report of

[1:27:08] Kamal Harris did not become a
[1:27:12] president because if she had become one
[1:27:15] she would have fastened all these

[1:27:27] Rapture tell someone about the Lord
[1:27:29] about this message we have a short

[1:27:43] ephus Amen to the
[1:27:45] sea that is your
[1:27:48] cost I want you to hear the words that
[1:27:50] president nanyu or prime minister

[1:27:56] to the US Congress on July
[1:28:01] 24 this
[1:28:03] year listen to these words and I'll read
[1:28:06] it to you he was speaking about these
[1:28:11] protesters and he said these protesters
[1:28:16] chant from The River To The
[1:28:19] Sea and then he he pauses and then he
[1:28:23] tells the people
[1:28:25] the lawmakers in America and all those
[1:28:27] government
[1:28:28] people he tells them this but many don't
[1:28:32] have a
[1:28:34] clue what river and what sea they
[1:28:37] talking
[1:28:38] about they not only get an F in
[1:28:45] geography they also get an F in
[1:28:52] history they call Israel a colonialist
[1:28:58] state and listen to these words they
[1:29:00] struck my
[1:29:01] heart he said don't they
[1:29:04] know that the land of Israel is where
[1:29:10] Abraham
[1:29:11] Isaac and Jacob
[1:29:14] pray where
[1:29:16] Isaiah and Jeremiah
[1:29:18] pre where David and Solomon
[1:29:22] rulle for nearly th000
[1:29:25] years the land of Israel has been in the
[1:29:28] home has been the homeland of the Jewish
[1:29:32] people it has always been our
[1:29:35] home it will always be our
[1:29:40] home I say amen I love that a man who
[1:29:45] knows amen what belongs to
[1:29:49] them a man who knows which report to
[1:29:52] take
[1:29:54] you said this is
[1:29:55] politics I said this is more than
[1:29:59] politics this is amen God confirming his
[1:30:03] word in the 21st
[1:30:07] century standing with a
[1:30:09] nation God gave them the land and here
[1:30:13] is a modern day filthy
[1:30:16] leader coming up and he is able to you
[1:30:20] know he may be political and filth and
[1:30:22] all that
[1:30:25] but he is able to stand up and quote the
[1:30:29] word of God and say this is our life
[1:30:33] this is where Abraham was Isaac jaob
[1:30:37] isah Jeremiah
[1:30:39] davom the man is quoting the
[1:30:43] Bible the man is pointing to the
[1:30:46] word and the man is saying this has
[1:30:49] always been our
[1:30:51] home that's why they rejected Uganda
[1:30:55] because they knew their
[1:30:59] home and by the way the brother of n is
[1:31:01] the one who died here at
[1:31:05] airport during the reign of

[1:33:02] they are the church
[1:33:04] natural we are the church
[1:33:09] spiritual it is they he said it's been
[1:33:12] our
[1:33:15] home it has been the homeland of the
[1:33:17] Jewish
[1:33:19] people it's always been our home and it
[1:33:22] will always be our
[1:33:25] and I also say Amen every promise of the
[1:33:29] world has always been our
[1:33:32] homeland it shall always be our
[1:33:35] homeland no one can take it away from us
[1:33:39] take this whole
[1:33:41] world but leave me with the
[1:33:45] word and the 10 spies
[1:33:48] came and they brought an evil
[1:33:51] report numbers 13:32
[1:33:55] and they brought up an evil report of
[1:33:57] the
[1:33:58] land which they had searched unto the
[1:34:01] children of
[1:34:02] Israel saying the land though which the
[1:34:06] land through which we have gone to
[1:34:08] search it is a land that eth up its
[1:34:15] inhab and um and all the people that we
[1:34:19] saw in it are men of great sture
[1:34:24] pay attention there's something there's
[1:34:25] a con I'm going to take and you'll be
[1:34:26] amazed listen and there we saw the
[1:34:31] Giants did you hear
[1:34:33] that what
[1:34:37] Giants the sons of anak which come of
[1:34:40] the Giants and we were in in their our
[1:34:44] own site as
[1:34:48] grasshoppers so we were in their sight
[1:34:53] I want you to
[1:34:57] imagine
[1:34:58] this is a natural physical
[1:35:03] church God deals with them as a
[1:35:06] nation and everything about them is
[1:35:10] physical okay and so here their
[1:35:14] enemy was a physical
[1:35:17] enemy but the
[1:35:19] enemy were
[1:35:21] giants Giants
[1:35:24] and the Israelites remember these were
[1:35:26] spies they had
[1:35:28] sent if you are sending a spy you don't
[1:35:31] send the
[1:35:34] weing they must have sent the the strong
[1:35:39] ones like the brother emuel
[1:35:42] there strong like big
[1:35:45] man Mar
[1:35:48] tall you know so they must have sent the
[1:35:52] best you know not small
[1:35:55] people
[1:35:57] like no they didn't do
[1:36:01] that and you see when they reached there
[1:36:05] these people the best of the
[1:36:08] Jews before
[1:36:10] them they were like
[1:36:12] grasshoppers I want you to now
[1:36:15] imagine standing like a man like Brother
[1:36:18] Martin standing before these sons of
[1:36:22] anak
[1:36:24] and he's like
[1:36:26] [Music]
[1:36:29] here and he's
[1:36:32] there is like this looks like te like a
[1:36:35] grasshopper
[1:36:38] grasshopper that is how they
[1:36:42] appeared and these men they saw the
[1:36:45] fuits they saw everything it is as what
[1:36:49] God
[1:36:50] Said but when they saw the Giants
[1:36:54] they were
[1:36:56] disappointed they were disappointed with
[1:36:59] God so when they came back they came
[1:37:02] with an evil
[1:37:04] report because of their of the of the of
[1:37:07] the way their enemy looked
[1:37:10] like brother sister it is the same thing
[1:37:15] today we have our enemy but you see
[1:37:19] don't look at your
[1:37:21] enemy until you forget your promise
[1:37:26] you are seeing
[1:37:28] poverty as a huge giant before
[1:37:32] you and when the word of God says you a
[1:37:36] head not a
[1:37:37] tail then you begin to look down surely
[1:37:41] this is
[1:37:42] impossible you will Lear to the
[1:37:49] Nations it is a good
[1:37:52] scripture sounds good the fruits are
[1:37:55] here some people have tested it but for
[1:38:00] me it looks impossible let me tell you
[1:38:03] brother whatever looks impossible to
[1:38:06] you is impossible to
[1:38:10] God whose report do you
[1:38:15] believe hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:38:19] to you brother you may be seeing all the

[1:38:32] [Music]
[1:38:35] money I don't know whether it will be
[1:38:37] possible stop professing like
[1:38:40] that people we should begin to trust
[1:38:46] God we should begin to look to
[1:38:49] God we should put good God to a test
[1:38:54] because when you put it to a
[1:38:56] test amen he comes down and he says who
[1:39:01] is that believes me who is that believes
[1:39:04] me do you dare to believe
[1:39:07] God when you dare
[1:39:09] him he shows up he shows up there was
[1:39:14] one once a
[1:39:16] woman amen and this woman was called
[1:39:18] Hana she was Buren she didn't have a
[1:39:22] baby but you know she became
[1:39:25] desperate she went before God and she
[1:39:28] said surely no where is my baby God I
[1:39:32] want my baby I don't know where she
[1:39:35] learned
[1:39:36] that maybe maybe the priest preach that
[1:39:39] I don't but this woman became
[1:39:42] desperate she believed there was a God
[1:39:45] in
[1:39:46] heaven a God who was beyond her
[1:39:51] barness and she approached that God
[1:39:55] that God came
[1:39:56] down Hallelujah is the same
[1:40:01] today he can do the
[1:40:04] impossible he does impossible
[1:40:08] mathematics he does not need a
[1:40:11] degree to give you a powerful
[1:40:13] job are you hearing me he does not need
[1:40:17] experience to take you in good
[1:40:20] places he does not need connection

[1:40:26] supposed to be he will take you where he
[1:40:28] wants you to be he will make you
[1:40:33] move in a swift way more than you

[1:40:44] you need
[1:40:45] God you need to believe his
[1:40:48] report because his report is
[1:40:51] true his report has been proved over and
[1:40:54] over and over
[1:40:58] again Hallelujah when you start a
[1:41:01] business
[1:41:03] believe amen when you say my business is
[1:41:06] going down my things are dying then the
[1:41:10] devil begins to come
[1:41:11] more don't be discouraged when something
[1:41:15] happens begin to prophesy right there
[1:41:19] and say devil you have done this but
[1:41:23] because because of this you have made a
[1:41:25] big
[1:41:26] mistake because of this that you have
[1:41:29] stolen from me God is going to give me
[1:41:32] thousands
[1:41:35] more you know these are people who
[1:41:38] believe the report of
[1:41:43] God Amen if you are a TI
[1:41:47] payer you cannot suffer
[1:41:51] loss if you suffer loss
[1:41:54] the devil has tampered with somebody he
[1:41:56] was not supposed to tamper
[1:42:00] with are you hearing me he will try but
[1:42:04] when he tries tell him devil you have
[1:42:06] made AIG a very big
[1:42:11] mistake we need to own our
[1:42:15] life by believing the report of
[1:42:19] God hallelujah and the devil would say
[1:42:22] huh
[1:42:23] you've made a big
[1:42:26] mistake watch me sudden because of what
[1:42:30] you have done God is going to raise much
[1:42:34] more out of this by the way those things
[1:42:37] are not Idol
[1:42:42] prophesy God will give you an
[1:42:45] inspiration you know sometimes you need
[1:42:48] to be angered by those
[1:42:51] demons for
[1:42:56] inspiration that woman kept on following
[1:42:59] Paul you are the man of God that gives
[1:43:02] us the you are the man of God and Paul
[1:43:05] was suffering long with this
[1:43:07] demon and you see one time he was
[1:43:16] angered from that
[1:43:18] moment the demons
[1:43:20] left and the people we are making money
[1:43:22] out of
[1:43:24] they became angry they made a big
[1:43:27] mistake to make that Spirit Fall
[1:43:31] upon hallu if those evil spirits follow
[1:43:34] you the devil is making a big
[1:43:37] mistake you need to begin Amen in your
[1:43:41] prayer get
[1:43:43] anointed and begin to prophesy over
[1:43:46] yourself over your
[1:43:48] situation and then you begin to see
[1:43:51] change why because if you believe the
[1:43:54] report of
[1:43:55] God it shall be
[1:43:58] done even as it
[1:44:00] said and so these Giants the sons of
[1:44:04] anak they were there and these people
[1:44:06] were fearful of
[1:44:09] them and I'll tell you this who are
[1:44:12] these
[1:44:13] Giants can you now go back to Genesis
[1:44:15] because now remember here in the Book of
[1:44:19] Numbers we are looking at a time after
[1:44:21] the flood
[1:44:24] are you following me but now when you go
[1:44:27] before the
[1:44:29] flag Genesis 64 the Bible says these
[1:44:33] there were giants in the earth in those
[1:44:37] days and also so after that when the
[1:44:41] sons of God came in unto the daughters
[1:44:43] of
[1:44:44] men and they bear children to
[1:44:48] them the same became Mighty Men
[1:44:54] which were of old men of
[1:44:58] rown
[1:45:02] giants how which which which which men
[1:45:05] are
[1:45:06] these the theologians
[1:45:10] say that these were out of
[1:45:16] angels but we have a prophet who has
[1:45:20] come and told us exactly what it was
[1:45:24] these were the out of the mixture of the
[1:45:27] daughters of
[1:45:30] men and the sons of God and the prophet
[1:45:33] says it was from the lineage of Cain and
[1:45:35] the lineage
[1:45:38] of because we know the we know Cain was
[1:45:42] a seed of the
[1:45:45] serpent in plain language Kan was a son
[1:45:48] of
[1:45:50] Satan but we see these two just
[1:45:54] mixed and brought forth
[1:45:57] Giants so now this is going to blow your
[1:46:01] mind here in the Book of Numbers we see
[1:46:04] Giants
[1:46:06] again remember these Giants in the old
[1:46:09] times they all died in the in the
[1:46:12] flag so then how come that we have
[1:46:14] Giants after the
[1:46:17] flag you know someone will debate with
[1:46:19] you and say well these were all children
[1:46:22] they were Canan which means they were
[1:46:24] really coming out of
[1:46:28] Noah because they came out of the son of
[1:46:30] Noah called
[1:46:33] H and so then you wonder you say well
[1:46:36] how come that you have serpent SE
[1:46:38] through
[1:46:42] the but one thing I want to say I love
[1:46:44] this
[1:46:45] message hallelujah amen listen to what
[1:46:48] the prophet says in the message the
[1:46:49] serpent
[1:46:51] seat now and his sons which come out H
[1:46:55] shame and
[1:46:58] Jeff they come out in the rightous
[1:47:03] line how did the seed ever get over the
[1:47:07] seed of the
[1:47:10] serpent the seed come over in the
[1:47:15] ark just like it did in the
[1:47:18] beginning through the
[1:47:21] woman their wife
[1:47:26] They Carried the seed of
[1:47:28] Satan through the
[1:47:31] ark just as Eve packed the seed of
[1:47:35] Satan to give birth to
[1:47:38] Cain through the
[1:47:40] woman
[1:47:42] okay okay I say Amen to
[1:47:46] that now that is not written anywhere in
[1:47:49] the Bible
[1:47:55] but if you
[1:47:56] can't read this
[1:47:59] quote if you can't read
[1:48:02] this if you can't read this
[1:48:05] quot then you can't
[1:48:08] understand why
[1:48:11] God gave
[1:48:13] Israelites the land of
[1:48:15] Canan and he kicked them
[1:48:18] out
[1:48:21] mercilessly I'm giving you the land of
[1:48:24] the hites of the jeites of the god
[1:48:29] possess
[1:48:32] what and he says questions and answers
[1:48:35] so the Giants never come from pressing
[1:48:38] themselves
[1:48:41] in these Giants were the sons of
[1:48:45] K we are now talking about the Giants
[1:48:48] that were in the promised
[1:48:51] land and jumps over and he takes it back
[1:48:55] again in the beginning he skips Noah he
[1:48:59] skips H he goes all the way to
[1:49:02] Cain and he says these were sons of
[1:49:07] Cain whose father was the
[1:49:11] serpent who looked in every respect
[1:49:14] exactly like a
[1:49:17] man but was a great huge fellow bigger
[1:49:20] than a man
[1:49:24] and that's where those Sons came
[1:49:27] from because they were the sons of
[1:49:30] Cain because they were
[1:49:33] Canaanites in the land of Canaan where
[1:49:36] they come from and that's where Cain
[1:49:38] went
[1:49:40] to and that also proves the serpent
[1:49:44] SE it was a different R of people all
[1:49:49] together that was serpent seed
[1:49:53] now that serpent seed question in in
[1:49:55] there so we are going to get to
[1:49:58] eat and I want you to bear this in your
[1:50:01] mind now just to give this
[1:50:04] backround they were
[1:50:06] canites these Giants they were the sons
[1:50:09] of Cain which was the son of The
[1:50:12] Serpent and the serpent was a giant
[1:50:16] man great monstrous sort of a
[1:50:20] fellow not a reptile
[1:50:24] at all beautiful he was the most subtle
[1:50:28] of all the beasts of the
[1:50:32] field the jeans from an animal into a
[1:50:36] woman will not breed at
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:44] all they tried it over and
[1:50:48] over unfertile to the woman's seed
[1:50:55] and now they can't find
[1:50:59] it it's the closest thing they can find
[1:51:02] to
[1:51:04] man or
[1:51:06] the or some of these close up to the
[1:51:09] man as God in his great Evolution begins
[1:51:12] to make
[1:51:15] fish then he made Birds listen now and
[1:51:19] then he made other things animals and
[1:51:22] they kept on coming up till one out of
[1:51:27] till one come out a
[1:51:30] chimpanzee a
[1:51:32] monkey
[1:51:33] a and then into a form of The
[1:51:38] Serpent and then from the
[1:51:41] serpent to a
[1:51:43] man serpent was not a
[1:51:47] snake it was a
[1:51:50] beast like creature
[1:51:55] Giant and Mankind has tried to search
[1:51:57] science tries to find
[1:52:01] bondes what this animal was that was
[1:52:04] next to the human
[1:52:07] being and and human is an
[1:52:11] animal the man the flesh part is an
[1:52:13] animal
[1:52:16] flesh we know that we are
[1:52:19] M which is warm blood animal
[1:52:24] we know that but what makes the
[1:52:26] difference the animal does not have the
[1:52:29] inward
[1:52:31] [Music]
[1:52:33] soul but the human being
[1:52:36] does he don't Beast the animal doesn't
[1:52:39] know right from
[1:52:41] wrong but the animal does the human
[1:52:44] being
[1:52:46] does now with
[1:52:48] that mindblowing revelation
[1:52:53] the children of
[1:52:55] Israel the children of the
[1:52:58] promise my good Lord they stood
[1:53:02] before the physical seed of
[1:53:07] Satan have you ever heard
[1:53:16] itally they stood
[1:53:19] before the seed of Satan
[1:53:23] they had the upper
[1:53:27] hand why because they had a bigger
[1:53:32] go they had to
[1:53:34] overcome because they had a
[1:53:38] promise amen hallu I want you to imagine
[1:53:43] these children of Israel stood before
[1:53:46] physical children of sat
[1:53:52] but yet they were not
[1:53:55] overcome they were like
[1:53:58] grasshoppers but yet they overcame the
[1:54:01] Giants they drove them one by
[1:54:04] one out of the land
