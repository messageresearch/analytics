speak to me Lord Jesus heavenly father I'm just waiting upon you Lord oh king of Father may you bring out all that you put on my heart that your children may be blessed I pray Lord through your might name Jesus CHR hallelujah hallelujah uh let's go straight to the word in John 9 verse 1-4 let us read and as Jesus passed by he saw a man which was blind from his birth and his deciples asked him saying this man or his parents that he was born blind Jesus answered neither has this man sinned nor his parents but that but but that the works of God should be manifested in him amen I must work the works of him that sent me while it is day the night cometh when no man can work Hallelujah [Music] amen you can have your seats uh today I have some sensitive uh title that I want to talk about and someon because even when I was studying it was so hard for me I was feeling a lot of fear because of what I was reading so I I hope we are going to be blessed Hallelujah so my my my topic today it will be flaws of Life flows of life no flows are like like [Music] weaknesses many of us not even many of us all of us have Flows In Our Lives all of us have Flows In Our Lives weaknesses we have imperfections in us we have faults in us that we also don't desire that's how God created us hallelujah hallelujah because he had a reason to why we are born like that why that is happening and he knows why you may ask yourself why what did I do to God like this the disciples were asking Jesus why did did this man sin did the par sin why is he born blind some crooked have like maybe have one leg short or one leg tall some are very many people are born with weird things but the Bible is telling us that is all for the glory of God hallelujah hallelujah everything that happens to us it is for the glory of God and to to uh as in Romans chter 8 verse 28 it says we and we know that all things happen together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose Hallelujah so God has placed flows in your lives to glorify his name sometimes you you isolate yourself from people because of the flaws you have in life because people have mocked you some have mocked from childhood because of what they were they didn't decide about it but they were born like that some things we adopt them in life the flaws of Life some we adopt them because of the situations all the families we are born in some are born in broken families why their parents are always quing and the child grows up hating marriage like nothing because he had no good example from me that is also FL his life some are born in poor families all those are flaws some are born uh and their parents just uh they they tell them stories that hey we found you on the the garbage Gage no the ones that adopted them that will found you here some grow up without knowing their parents they squee my dad you don't they don't know and those things follow us those things hinder us some of us like maybe some uh some people cannot speak maybe in public because maybe of how they grew up how maybe they cannot speak well maybe they're not learned they fear speaking people they fear people are going to laugh at my and they hinder them in life some others are born with dark skins and people they most people know that people like brown people and it becomes a flow and feel as if you're not worthy some very I can talk about very [Music] many amen but we know God uses every flow don't accept to be behind your flaws and hinder you to do what you're supposed to do because God has a work for you Hallelujah in whatever situation you're in or in whatever flow you in you have God knew all of it God knew everything something what did I do to God to become poor like this what did I do to God for my parents not to have school but God has a reason to why it is happen you just have to trust God and you'll see him moving in your life use your flow to glorify the name of God there's a lady I was reading about brother Bram talked about him very many times he a fancy uh let me let me let me let me remember the second name fancy cross CR cross cross fancy fancy cross this lady was born I think she was not born blind but at 6 weeks due to medical issues she became BL but but when you reading the history when you read about her life now and you see how she glorified you'll wonder she was blind she she is recognized of writing 8,000 hymns we have already sung this song some of you you been singing her songs when even you don't know she always wrote those songs even after being mocked the song that we previously s pass me yeah uh Blessed Assurance very many songs that we have been singing have been written by this but what if she had sat on her FL and she said that God created me like this created me I can't do this it is up to him he has written songs that have touched very B safe In the Arms of Jesus to God be the glory the songs that have really [Music] bless I hope all of you have been blessed by those generation after generation we have been blessed she wrote this song pass me pass me they ask you what does Jesus mean to you it's when she wrote this song So when they ask you when you in New FL what does God mean to you hallelujah amen I think we have been asked that question very many times but my friends I want you this our God is faithful he knew everything that would happen in your life hallu we are very many of us are mocked because of the things that are in our lives because of the imperfections in our lives but I want to tell you this that our God is faithful he knew it all Hallelujah he knew that this would happen in your life but it's is up to you now how you going to use your flow are you going to use it to to glorify God or to just go behind it and be tormented all your life my friends the advice I would give you use it for the glory of God you see the hand of God in your life like this lady even now now they still speak about her because of what she did the thief at the cross if she had overlooked her his flow that I cannot be saved like the other who was on the cross he would not be saved and would not about him right now so all the flaws that come in our lives God knows them hallelujah amen I want to read you this quote hallelujah hallelujah here questions and answers uh 59 he says what about brother Mike isn't that wonderful he loved you he loved you before there was a world he knew he knew your nature he knew your weakness he knew your habits he knew all about you what what what you you was you are going to be and then and then what you are going to be and then M when he looked all over the great universe as it was he said I chose you Hallelujah and when he did that before there was a spark of light then you you you are internal with God when you receive the Holy Spirit the Holy Ghost then you become internal because you are with God you are a part of God can you see what I mean you are etal as God is you because he chose you with all your flaws he chose you with all your weaknesses that you may think will let you down that think that will not no one has an account of you no one has account of you only God someone may love at you today and tomorrow you're the going to help them someone may help you today and them more tomorrow because they see you in need but they don't know even what God has for you they don't know your tomorrow hallelujah amen many have sat on your floors and have made you a poor Christian and I made you give a wrong testimony about your God many have fallen very many times and I've said I cannot why do you get the guts of saying you cannot be Sav hallelujah amen we see Samson he had his own flows in life brother says all the prophets had flows in life all the people you read about all had flows in life but what did they do with them what did Samson do just for once small and was granted to him you may be at the end point at the end of the road saying my Christianity is now gone but there's a one smallen you may think that God maybe I may not go back school but there's God you may think that I don't have what to eat in the morning but there God who knew the Widow and imagine this Elijah when he came to the Widow he said you give me bread and eat I can I'm going with my baby and die but she used her flow and and God to give her and multip use your flow to serve God use your FL to glorify God see how he's going to pay you because brother says there's no service to do to God that shall not be paid Amina serve God with all your life and you'll see how he's going to bless am don't look on your weaknesses many people have not lived their life that God has prepared for [Music] them because of focusing on their flaws focusing on minor things and leaving out the major all opportunities they do not come easily being a great person in life there's a joury but people just want to fly and go and they skip the process is that FL that can make whatever you want to be in life you may say I don't know English I cannot H I don't I don't have a good voice I cannot sing H my my family is not even known in church so they cannot even allow me to minister don't let your flow overrule you Hallelujah because we have a God that cares he knew us he chose us he chose me and you he chose all the men that you admire the Bible he chose all the women you admire the Bible sometimes you look at Ruth in the Bible you said Lord I want to be like that one you look at Daniel in the Bible you said I want to be like that one you look at Jacob in the Bible you want to be like that one but do you know what Jacob went through he wrestled the angel until God bless him but for you seated on on your on your Flor hallelujah hallelujah what is your flow ask yourself what can I do your lamb you cannot preach but many have done it through their flows they become great they become that you're reading about look at Jesus he was born in a mang in a very poor condition that no man even can recognize him but did he not confess that he's a Son of God and think about it how can a Son of God be born in sometimes things are hidden in your weaknesses that God May reveal them to people that they will see that there's God here in the Book of John we have read about that man who was born blind but he was healed and when you Contin with the down verses the FES they started asking that who healed you but were you you born even blind they even called the parents they said was this man born blind but they had said if they say yes they're going to chase them away from the synagogue some of you even fear to give your testimony where God has brought you from so that you can edify the bride of Christ because you fear people are going to look at Amina the parents said ah he's the old man can you can ask him you can ask him and he confessed he said Jesus has saved me they CH him and he went and followed Jesus CHR they will laugh at you they will mock you go and Jesus Christ all will be well amen many have been chased from your jobs because of what you stand for continue following God is more than able he's going to use that people that what people look at as a flow in your life and change life amen sometimes it's not necess it is not necessary that what you're praying for like it is not necessary whatever you're praying for that is what you're going to receive sometimes you have to wait upon God and ask God what do you want me to do what do you want to do and God he will lead you like now this lady F CR if they ask her they her that you're blind but you're serving God but she said when you read the relics of the songs she said I see him I will see him hallelujah amen sometimes your situation may not change but if you continue with that test there's a result after that Hallelujah and I'm telling you it will be positive you testify can you liveing a Christian Life something good will come out that no man can give that passes uh that that passes all understanding of men that passes all understanding of men am look at Job the flows he had in life God had given him out that he he had allowed the devil to go and tempt him and during that situation he was in he stood with his fls invite God his friends used to come and discourage him the wife used to discourage him even your close family members can discourage you even your mom can discourage you your father can discourage you but continue standing with God you see what will come out hallelujah amen he said only one thing in job 19: 256 for I know that my redeemer liveth he shall stand at the later day upon the Earth and though after my skin my my skin warms my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall shall I see God sometimes situations eat you up but tell that situation that after this situation I will see God and as you have read we shall be with him Eternal and as he us just you confessing one day that no man knows knows no Prophet knows God is going to come and take his bride am one day he will find you with when you you are in your flaws but still holding on and turn your life here brother Bram says in why Christ speak now though his mother had told him these things he was meaning the mother of Moses and he know this yet he needed another touch no expl let me read it again you now though his mother had told him that him these things and he know this yet needed another touch the teaching was the teaching was fine but he needed a personal contact that's what the world needs today that's what the church needs today that's uh that's what everyone needs that sons and daughters of God in order to be that you need a personal contact see something no matter you know the word is true you know it is right but then when it contacts and then you see the thing done then you know you are on the right Road see and what and watch it's always it always be scripture it it it will will stand right with the scripture hallelujah amen it's okay amen H everyone needs a personal contact no one is going to always console you that is there will help you preachers will come here say don't don't worry but I have a point of contact with God and I have a personal a personal contact with God will be motivated because he will give us the holy spirit that will teach us in everything that will teach us to live in every situation Amina no matter what your situation is Our God will never forsake many may but our God will never forsake us stand on your feet and say I know my redeemer I know my redeemer living though these situations rage I know my red amen hallelujah hallelujah here we see Moses and why Christ speakes said oh Lord looking No Moses say oh Lord look coming luk coming he was meaning far like let me complete the statement he said Moses say oh L Lord coming here comes far the people are all what the people are all he didn't complete the statement he said the people are all he mean he was worried what must I do what must I do see there's that see there isn't that just human beings begin to cry what must I do here we see Moses extremely fully human he said here we see Moses expressing fully human nature always wants go to get back always wants go to get to get to get back to you and push you in into something will push you now that's us today you want God after we have seen all we have seen yet you want God to push you to do something Moses has just reled or relaxed around said God I'll go ask you see what you say see what uh see what you say yeah yeah you say it well all all right I'll say it too but here God has ordained him for the job proved that he was he was with him and he is and and here he is the circumstance come up and then he begins to cry What Can I Do Lord what can I do it is the same situation we are in God has promised that he will not forsake us he has chosen us do you think he just chose us to to suffer and then we die and then we we rebuke God all we need has put in us use your flows to serve God use your FL to glorify God God has put everything you need like Moses he said I'm with you when he made the burning bush he said I be with you so he says you now he is with you why C speak amen Amina we always cry we go around God has forsaken me now see my children as see now see and this but everything he has put in us we see the three Hebrews when they were going into the fire everyone knows fire BS even when they tell you to put your finger but they believed even without and they took they T them and they took them sometimes the devil paints fire and he scares you you say if I reach that will that was like pointed fire to them no that was painted fire to them the Hebrews because you didn't bur them because they had God in their Liv so also have God in our situation whatever circumstance you go through whatever situation we have god with us because he will never forsake us because he chose us hallelujah amen we are his bright ask yourself like now brother martin he has to toil for his wife my friend he has to do whatever he can so can be up whose bride are you we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and take care of us in whatever [Applause] situation hallelujah hallelujah why could I speak say God I want this Amina our God is so faithful he loved us he knew us he knew us in our weaknesses even there some weaknesses that you know you yourself that you can never even tell someone some are battling with addictions some are battling with things in life that even their parents do not know some are battling with things that even their husbands or their wives do not know but our God knows everything I mean amen Our God knows everything he and the message the Masterpiece says all the prophets had flaws all the ones was all the ones was abortion all the ones was a portion all the ones was a portion but here at last uh coming up through that finally comes the Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in him at all so perfect reflected of the Builder himself his own image was reflected in in his work God and Christ were one so much until he put his own Spirit into him and then even the image of the Builder became one God and His sculpture work his Masterpiece where Moses was in the work of uh Michael Angelo sculpture work that was dead but because it had been made out of stone but here the master builder when he got this handw handw workk perfected he stepped into it so perfected a redeemer of man so perfect so Godly yet there was no Beauty we should desire in him when this virgin born son of the Living God uh became so perfect and humble and in the image of God the great the master who had brought his life up through the prophets he was the fulfilling of all the prophets he was so until God seeing this is me him and cried speak as Michel Angel did hallelujah amen God is perfecting us also God is perfecting our bright your weaknesses Amina amen he's going to perfect Us in everything and because he said in his word he will take a bride without any wrinkle or until you go through because God promised that all promises are yours Amina I think my time is also getting up but I had a lot to tell you because God had put a lot on my heart Aina but I think we shall just cut them no we shall just cut them like as we conclude in like 10 minutes here in the Masterpiece again brother brother says to me the flow was what it made the the Masterpiece to me the flow was what made it the masterpie he was meaning Michel Angelo when he struck the the the sculpture on the knee so that it can speak that's what brought out the meaning of a a Amina in your weaknesses it's how God is going to mold you up and you become a masterpiece because he's a savior do you save something that is already saved you save something that is lost and you will strike you and you become Aina amen because he said he will try us more than gold in that is pass through fire even now in our weaknesses sometimes you feel like giving up because of the burden on you but God is faithful and he will stand with you if you keep standing Amina amen friends I want to tell you this brother said here notice notice this how beautiful oh I love this you know finally said go get out God just pledged him like pled him with the voice of Moses he struck everything done everything there there was there he done everything there was to be done am in the middle of the day he done everything else he blacken the days frogs BL freeze R everything else fire fire smoke and death to his families and everything he done everything till finally far had to say get out take all you go go oh my praise godina look at this H he again says here I'm so glad that a that a man can be so completely uh that can so completely serve God till he the devil don't know what to do with him that's right justy God so completely the devil says oh get away Allelujah am say get away because complicated hallelujah amen hallelujah the devil will say get away you'll overcome the devil and you say ah like when Jesus came to the knocked on the door the devil hallelujah amen one day is coming when the devil say get [Music] away because you have become a problem to the devil Amina amen I want us to reach that point that the devil can say get away I cannot deal with you Hallelujah amen now listen to this as we are closing uh here brother Bram say then when any little thing comes up why you act like a baby you ought to be a man speak to the people amen the move then move forward amen there you are don't cry speak amen oh I like that why you crying to me about just speak to the people and go forward and go for to your objectives whatever it is if it is sickness or whatever it is toise the dead to rise the dead or whatever it is speak I have proved it speak to the people what a lesson what a lesson oh my at this stage of the journey where no he was meaning now at this stage of the journey where we are standing look where at now look where you are now sir at the third pool notice we are right here at the door of the coming of the Lord am amen here he was anointed for the job was meaning Moses and still waiting for thus says the Lord God must just have got enough of it he said Don't Cry Anymore speak I sent you he has chosen us sometimes we fail to do what we supposed to do that I'm waiting for that says the Lord the word has already proved it am I'm waiting uh waiting for an angel to come and no I mean I waiting for an angel to fall and give me my my message from godina we are waiting for that say the Lord Moses was given everything he was proved you are also proved to be the Sons and Daughters of God but you crying that I'm waiting for that says the Lord that I'm the Son of God Amina amen we always there crying crying but he has chosen us am amen
