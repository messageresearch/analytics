[28:19] again
[28:21] hallelujah amen now I want you to listen
[28:23] here in the Book of
[28:25] Genesis let us see where we get this
[28:28] idea
[28:29] from in Genesis 22
[28:34] verse1 I am going to read it only in
[28:36] English so if you you are if you want it
[28:39] in luganda read it in your
[28:44] Bible so listen to me because there are
[28:47] quite several verses and I want to keep
[28:49] time there are 18 verses so I want to
[28:52] read and you you follow
[28:54] me if you have the scripture you can put
[28:56] it up there
[29:00] and it came to pass after these things
[29:03] that
[29:04] God did tempt Abraham and said unto him
[29:07] Abraham and he said behold here I am and
[29:10] he said take now thy son thy only son
[29:12] Isaac whom thou lovest and uh get thee
[29:15] into the land of Moria and offer him
[29:18] here for there for a b offering upon uh
[29:21] one of the mountains which I will tell
[29:23] thee of and Abraham rose up early in the
[29:26] morning and said saddled his ass and
[29:28] took two of his younger men with him and
[29:31] Isaac his son and caved the wood uh for
[29:34] the burnt offering and Rose up and went
[29:36] unto the place which God had told him
[29:40] then on the third day Abraham lifted up
[29:43] his eyes and saw the place a far off and
[29:47] and Abraham said unto his young man
[29:50] abide ye here with the US and I and the
[29:53] Lord will go Yonder and worship and come
[29:56] again to you and Abraham took the wood
[29:58] of the BT offering and laid it upon
[30:01] Isaac his son and he took the fire in
[30:04] his hand and a knife and they went uh
[30:06] both of them together and Isaac uh spake
[30:10] unto Abraham his father and said my
[30:13] father and he said here am I my son and
[30:16] he said behold the fire and the wood but
[30:20] where is the Lamb for a burnt offering
[30:23] and Abraham said my son God will provide
[30:27] him s a larm for a burnt
[30:30] offering so they went both of them
[30:32] together and they came to a place which
[30:34] God had told him off and Abraham built
[30:37] an altar there and laid the wood in
[30:39] order and bound Isaac his son and laid
[30:42] him on the altar upon the wood and
[30:44] Abraham stretched forth his hand and
[30:46] took the knife to slay his son and the
[30:50] angel of the Lord called unto him out of
[30:52] heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he
[30:55] said here mine and he said l lay not thy
[30:58] hand upon the Lord neither do thou
[31:00] anything unto him for now I know that
[31:03] thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast
[31:06] not withheld thy son thy only son from
[31:09] me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and
[31:12] looked and behold behind him a ram CAU
[31:15] in a Thicket by his thorns and Abraham
[31:17] went and took the RAM and offered him up
[31:20] for B offering in the stad of his son
[31:23] and Abraham called the name of the Lord
[31:25] uh of that place Je
[31:28] praise God as it is said to this day in
[31:32] the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen
[31:34] and the angel of the Lord called unto
[31:36] Abraham Out of Heaven the second time
[31:38] and said by myself I have sworn sayith
[31:42] the Lord for because thou Hast done this
[31:44] thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy
[31:47] only son that in blessing I Will Bless
[31:51] thee and in multiplying but I want to
[31:54] show you here that Israel is a nation
[31:57] that came out of
[31:59] Abraham and they also came out of
[32:03] Isaac you see so they are they have a
[32:05] covenant this is the Covenant that God
[32:07] gave
[32:09] them that convenant of the blessing of
[32:11] God flows through that
[32:15] L you see they were blessed by God no
[32:19] man can cast them right now as I'm
[32:22] speaking to you Israel is being
[32:25] attacked from many corners
[32:28] from Lebanon is
[32:30] attacking Hamas from Gaza is
[32:33] attacking and other
[32:36] terrorists other nations that hate
[32:39] Israel and everybody is fighting against
[32:42] Israel people are going to the streets
[32:44] all over the world by thousands and
[32:47] thousands demonstrating that we want you
[32:50] know Israel to seize the
[32:53] fire but do you realize that the target
[32:56] of these people
[32:58] is to kill
[33:00] Israel and wipe it out of the
[33:04] M their plan is not for them to live in
[33:07] peace their plan is for Israel to be
[33:10] wiped
[33:11] away but Israel is saying This Is Our
[33:15] Land God gave it to
[33:17] us we will not live we can live with the
[33:21] rest of the
[33:22] tribes as long as you allow us to live
[33:25] in peace with you
[33:27] but the others are saying no we will
[33:30] wipe you
[33:31] away Iran for example heah they're
[33:34] saying
[33:35] the they saying the same Israel must be
[33:39] wiped away they Israel with a
[33:44] passion but do you know what there is
[33:47] nothing they can do to destroy
[33:50] Israel and the Bible says pray for the
[33:54] Peace of
[33:55] Jerusalem every Bible
[33:58] lover every Jesus Lover must not only
[34:02] love
[34:03] Israel they must pray for
[34:07] Israel and I tell you what Israel has a
[34:10] covenant with
[34:12] God and that Covenant cannot be
[34:15] removed it is a covenant that started
[34:18] with with
[34:19] Abraham and it was given to Abraham and
[34:23] that it would follow through Isaac his
[34:25] son
[34:27] do you know where all these others
[34:30] came they came from
[34:33] Hagar Hagar was a mistress of
[34:38] Abraham
[34:39] and got a son and that son was called
[34:44] is and he the he's the father great
[34:50] grandfather those Hamas
[34:54] andah that is true is historical
[34:59] isical but Israel comes from the
[35:03] linage of
[35:05] Isaac and God had given Abraham a
[35:10] promise and you know out of what
[35:13] happened because he told him listen to
[35:16] me he said now Abraham you remember
[35:21] Abraham at first never had a
[35:24] child and God promised him
[35:27] I will give you a son I will give you a
[35:30] son trust me believe me Abraham and SAR
[35:35] believed
[35:37] God and God gave them a son and when
[35:40] Abra when when when ISAC
[35:43] AR the child of the
[35:46] promise then God came back again and he
[35:49] said Abraham I know you believe me so
[35:54] here I have one more thing to say to you
[35:57] give me your
[35:58] son your only
[36:01] son give him to me many times when we
[36:05] hold
[36:06] something we don't want to let
[36:09] go whatever you
[36:11] have whatever you have if it's not
[36:15] Jesus it is
[36:17] nothing it is
[36:19] nothing if you think you have
[36:22] knowledge it is nothing if you think you
[36:25] have wisdom is nothing if you think you
[36:27] have money it is nothing it's all
[36:30] nothing without
[36:31] him all nothing without
[36:34] him and I can prove that to you by the
[36:37] Bible he is a rich man who came to Jesus
[36:41] and spoke to him and said good Master
[36:45] what can I do to inherit etal life Jesus
[36:49] told him go and do the
[36:51] law he said I have fulfilled The Works
[36:54] of the law from the time I was a child
[37:00] ah Jesus told him you have done well but
[37:03] there is one more
[37:04] thing go sell all your
[37:07] riches give it to the poor come follow
[37:12] me the rich man was sad he went away sad
[37:17] in
[37:18] his if you don't believe
[37:21] Jesus you will go our
[37:23] side I always say body that hears the
[37:27] gospel being
[37:30] preached and you don't believe it
[37:33] whether you believe it or
[37:35] not you can never be the same
[37:39] again if you if you don't believe it
[37:42] will
[37:44] go but if you believe it you will be
[37:48] happy you will be happy you will not
[37:51] only be happy you will also be
[37:55] rich now this Young
[37:58] Ruler he went side because he did not
[38:02] have
[38:03] Jesus the only thing you needed to do is
[38:07] what Jesus
[38:08] said sell
[38:10] everything and take and follow me oh are
[38:14] we ready to do that to sell
[38:18] everything and follow him we cannot
[38:21] trust anything else we only trust
[38:24] him s everything and follow me
[38:27] and here then comes we go back to
[38:30] Abraham so then God comes back to
[38:33] Abraham and says now
[38:36] Abraham my friend I want your son give
[38:40] me your son your only
[38:43] son you must be willing to give up he
[38:46] said I will do whatever God
[38:48] says You must be willing to say I will
[38:52] do whatever God
[38:54] say as long as it is his
[38:57] I will do whatever he say and Abraham
[39:00] said son come follow me he took some of
[39:04] his servants and together they went and
[39:07] the Bible tells me when Abraham reached
[39:10] a place he saw the place that God told
[39:16] him
[39:18] on and he knew to he thought to himself
[39:22] there is no way he can go to that
[39:24] place with with people who are not in
[39:27] the
[39:29] convenant so he looked back and he told
[39:32] all his
[39:33] servants please stay
[39:35] here with the
[39:37] donkeys me and my son are going up on
[39:41] the
[39:42] hill
[39:45] toship the Bible says he that will not
[39:49] leave his mother and father and brother
[39:50] sister blah blah blah blah
[39:53] blah not worthy of me sometimes people
[39:56] want to believe the
[39:58] message they want be baptized in the
[39:59] name of our Lord Jesus Christ but they
[40:02] fear what mama will say what Papa would
[40:05] say me my mother was my mother disowned
[40:09] me because of this
[40:11] truth but after some
[40:14] years right now as I'm speaking to you I
[40:17] am her
[40:20] pastor for three years for three years
[40:25] she couldn't look at me I couldn't look
[40:26] at
[40:28] because of this truth if you lose if you
[40:31] save your life you lose
[40:32] it but if you lose your life you will
[40:34] save
[40:36] it and Abraham looked at the servants
[40:40] and told them stay with
[40:42] the oh I love my mom I believe in
[40:45] obeying a
[40:46] parent but when it comes to the word I
[40:49] believe in obeying the
[40:51] word so even me at that time I show my
[40:55] mama I told my brothers I told my
[40:58] sisters stay with the
[41:01] donkeys as for me I am going up on the
[41:05] mountain I am going to worship God I'm
[41:09] going to believe every word of
[41:11] God maybe if you have a friend who
[41:15] doesn't want you to believe the world
[41:18] you have a
[41:19] girlfriend boyfriend who is nagging you
[41:22] all the time doesn't want you to believe
[41:24] the word must be able to tell them stay
[41:28] with the
[41:29] donkeys stay with the donkeys as for me
[41:34] I am going on the
[41:35] mountain I am going on the mountain to
[41:38] Worship the
[41:40] Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then we
[41:44] find you know that they stayed with the
[41:46] donkeys they didn't know what was going
[41:48] to take place on the
[41:50] mountain but guess what Abraham went on
[41:53] the mountain with his son Isaac
[41:56] and when they arrived there Abraham ISAC
[42:00] realized there is something missing his
[42:03] father had told
[42:06] him that we cannot
[42:10] worship without an
[42:12] offering so if you come to
[42:15] church come with an
[42:18] offering don't come
[42:20] empty-handed come with an
[42:23] offering are you hearing me is a way of
[42:29] worship and the first offering is your
[42:32] broken
[42:33] heart contrite
[42:36] spirit you must be willing to submit
[42:39] yourself to the word of
[42:41] God whatever he says I will believe it
[42:45] and then now you can talk about the
[42:47] money now here they didn't have an
[42:50] offering he knew somehow God is able to
[42:54] provide a sacrifice
[42:57] do what God is word
[42:59] saying God will do the
[43:02] rest God will do the
[43:05] rest will do the
[43:07] rest
[43:09] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise
[43:13] God praise God will show
[43:18] up will show
[43:20] up and when they arrived there you
[43:24] know Abraham put in his
[43:27] eort fear
[43:29] not don't fear anything at all don't
[43:33] fear anything at all because the
[43:36] blessing of God gives wisdom the
[43:40] blessing of God brings Rememberance the
