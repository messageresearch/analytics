[32:04] [Music]
[32:14] foreign
[32:17] [Music]
[32:46] father Lord we thank you so much for the
[32:48] victory in Jesus
[32:51] foreign
[33:07] [Music]
[33:25] I mean
[33:27] amen
[33:28] [Applause]
[33:31] I would like to greet you once again in
[33:32] the name of Jesus
[33:35] Christ
[33:39] that the Lord is giving you Grace
[33:43] to move on in this journey
[33:51] there's the devil will throw whatever he
[33:54] wants to throw in the middle of the road
[33:59] Gala
[34:00] but did you realize
[34:02] that the Bible says to them that
[34:05] overcome
[34:08] and it says that in every generation
[34:13] so which means in every generation it is
[34:20] and there were many excuses of those who
[34:23] did not overcome
[34:24] [Music]
[34:27] we would have overcome but because of
[34:29] this
[34:31] in our generation it was very difficult
[34:33] in this area
[34:36] but you see in every age
[34:39] despite those things that discourage
[34:43] there shall be those who shall overcome
[34:46] it what about
[34:48] and so whenever a morning comes and you
[34:52] are finding yourself in your Christian
[34:53] Journey still walking in this journey
[34:55] you are unovercome
[34:59] [Music]
[35:02] and so God bless you overcome us
[35:07] amen and may we continue to overcome
[35:09] every day
[35:13] uh and we shall render the power of
[35:15] certain powers
[35:20] we are reading out of second Peter
[35:22] chapter 2 chapter one
[35:31] and we shall read verses um
[35:34] second Peter 1 12.
[35:41] [Music]
[35:45] um I'd like you to remember brother
[35:47] shame in prayers
[35:49] [Music]
[35:53] the people there they actually they had
[35:57] I forgot to tell you on Sunday but they
[35:58] had their first uh service last last
[36:02] Saturday
[36:08] and they told me that it was attended by
[36:11] 16 students
[36:15] and he told me what he preached to them
[36:18] it was a very good subject
[36:22] and so in that meeting they agreed to me
[36:25] twice uh actually some one of them was
[36:28] suggesting every evening
[36:33] but they agree that they would be
[36:35] meeting twice a week
[36:39] and by God is Grace I'm planning to be
[36:42] taking the second day it is
[36:47] I don't know what they agreed on maybe
[36:51] uh Friday and Saturday or Wednesday and
[36:53] Saturday Thursday and Saturday
[36:56] [Music]
[36:58] so I'll be going there every Saturday
[37:02] and we'll share the message with those
[37:04] students
[37:06] I think that is a very good way for this
[37:09] message to go into the aviation industry
[37:15] really I believe that each of us
[37:20] whichever area we are in one hour
[37:24] can penetrate that area with this
[37:27] message
[37:30] if indeed you are truly burdened for
[37:33] this truth
[37:37] you want everyone to hear the message
[37:40] you want everyone to go to heaven
[37:44] so I mean you might be a student
[37:46] somewhere
[37:48] you might be going to work somewhere
[37:52] whatever you are doing
[37:54] please remember the Lord
[37:59] amen
[38:01] so we are reading verses 12.
[38:15] I hope everybody's there now is
[38:28] wherefore I will not be negligent to put
[38:31] you always in remembrance of these
[38:33] things though you know them and be
[38:36] established in the present truth
[38:39] in Japan
[38:47] [Music]
[38:52] amen amen may be seated
[38:57] so my subject to you this evening
[39:02] it's part two of what I shared with you
[39:04] last Wednesday
[39:10] how many remember what I shared on on
[39:12] Wednesdays
[39:14] [Music]
[39:15] what was that
[39:20] the message of the hour
[39:24] and so I usually speak for one hour on
[39:27] Wednesday
[39:30] and I'm asking for your undivided
[39:33] attention as we try to see what the Lord
[39:34] has for us tonight
[39:39] so Peter here writes and talks about
[39:42] what he calls the present truth
[39:48] it is impossible for there to be more
[39:51] than one truth in a generation
[39:56] there has never been more than one truth
[40:01] there has always been one truth
[40:05] and when Jesus came on Earth he said I
[40:08] am the way I am the truth
[40:10] [Music]
[40:13] he did not say I am a truth
[40:19] but he said I am the truth
[40:24] meaning outside of me
[40:27] you cannot find truth
[40:30] there is no truth anywhere else
[40:33] actually Jesus said that all the others
[40:36] that came before me yes
[40:39] they were thieves and robots
[40:45] I am lowly and meek
[40:48] and then he said I am the truth
[40:51] not only the truth he also said I am the
[40:54] way
[41:04] there is only one truth
[41:06] and that truth will be the same in every
[41:10] generation
[41:12] it can never change
[41:15] it can never change its form there is
[41:19] [Applause]
[41:23] time will change
[41:25] seasons will change
[41:28] the truth will always remain the same
[41:32] people even change the people that are
[41:35] on Earth today
[41:37] exactly in one thousand years if the
[41:40] lottery
[41:42] you will not have any of them on this
[41:45] Earth
[41:47] and that has happened several times
[41:51] since the days of Jesus Christ
[41:54] because you've had Generations Disappear
[41:57] Completely to write the name is
[41:59] other Generations
[42:02] but the truth has remained the same
[42:05] and no man can change the truth
[42:08] man will deceive man
[42:10] and they will appear to follow things or
[42:14] Traditions which appear like truth
[42:18] but regardless of what the devil tries
[42:21] to do
[42:23] the truth cannot be changed
[42:26] the truth cannot be exchanged
[42:28] the truth cannot be debated
[42:32] the truth Remains the truth
[42:36] and nothing but the truth
[42:40] and so God in his wisdom
[42:44] he gave his word
[42:47] the Bible says he gave you his word
[42:50] and he said great was the company of
[42:53] those that published it
[42:59] there are very many
[43:01] you find there were many preachers
[43:09] for example the book of Acts of the
[43:12] Apostles foreign
[43:19] [Music]
[44:13] the word of God cannot be changed or
[44:15] exchanged
[44:19] there have been many other people that
[44:21] have come with ideas
[44:24] they have been like Buddha for example
[44:27] Buddha like Muhammad for example and
[44:30] John Smith your kind of Smith the one
[44:33] who came with the with the idea that he
[44:35] met angels
[44:37] and they gave him a book which he called
[44:41] the the the third Testament
[44:44] and he says the Bible is true like a
[44:47] Bible in truth but God gave him a sad
[44:49] Testament
[44:51] in addition to the Bible
[44:53] and there is a big denomination
[44:57] that follows that a Doctrine
[45:01] and they believe they have the third
[45:03] Testament because
[45:05] things that are not in the Bible
[45:08] but it is in addition to the Bible
[45:12] you find one
[45:14] he said that what he heard
[45:17] he was given to him
[45:20] by administration of angels
[45:25] Mountain there in the Middle East
[45:28] and it's spoken that the Quran
[45:33] is Holy because the Quran has holy
[45:37] scriptures
[45:38] which came by the administration of
[45:41] angels
[45:42] and you have many other books
[45:45] there is a this other book I forgotten
[45:47] its name there's several other books
[45:49] that are considered to be holy books
[45:53] and many people believe in them in the
[45:55] world
[45:56] but all those books came after the Bible
[46:02] there is no books there is no
[46:07] inspiration
[46:09] that will be more than the Bible
[46:13] that will be true
[46:17] we've got that
[46:23] [Music]
[46:43] which we have received
[46:49] are you following me
[46:51] I'm a preacher so I'm preaching this to
[46:53] you but really I'm teaching
[46:57] sometimes I think I said to myself let
[47:00] me just go and be a quiet teacher and I
[47:02] teach this thing really well and I fail
[47:04] because I'm meant difference
[47:11] now I want you to look at Galatians
[47:14] chapter one
[47:18] praise the name of the Lord
[47:22] I want to bring perspective to you
[47:25] regarding this message
[47:26] [Music]
[47:31] verses six I mother that ye are soon
[47:33] removed from him that called you into
[47:35] the grace of Christ and to another
[47:37] gospel
[47:48] which is not another but there be some
[47:51] that trouble you and would pervert the
[47:54] gospel of Christ
[48:02] so in other words when Paul writes to
[48:04] the Galatians
[48:06] he's telling them something very
[48:08] important
[48:09] he's saying that I'm so surprised
[48:13] when you came to the knowledge of the
[48:15] grace of Christ through the gospel
[48:19] but that you've been called into another
[48:22] gospel
[48:24] to be removed from this goes and he went
[48:29] to another gospel
[48:30] all these others have been telling you
[48:33] are also gospels
[48:36] all these other books are gospels
[48:39] but then he says it is not another
[48:42] gospel
[48:45] but there are some that trouble you
[48:49] and pervert the gospel of Christ
[48:55] this other so-called gospels
[48:59] all these new traditions and ideas
[49:04] it is not another gospel
[49:08] the Quran is not another gospel Quran
[49:12] John Smith is Mormon teaching is not
[49:14] another gospel John Smith says
[49:21] there are many there are many more now
[49:23] where do you mean it's not entirely
[49:26] something new every trivia but what is
[49:30] it it is a perversion of the true gospel
[49:37] there have been those that have made big
[49:39] denominations
[49:42] and there have been those that have come
[49:44] and preached privately
[49:47] and they say God sent to them
[49:50] but when we see what they are preaching
[49:53] it is
[49:56] it is not founded in the scriptures
[49:59] that is how we are able to know
[50:02] that is the perversion of the truth
[50:06] and it is not the original foreign
[50:28] [Music]
[50:45] foreign
[50:52] [Applause]
[51:30] remember I'm talking about the message
[51:33] we have had a confusion
[51:36] people
[51:38] have thought
[51:42] something new
[51:44] with Watchers
[51:48] cannot be something new
[51:53] it cannot be something different from
[51:56] what was given in the beginning
[52:00] it cannot be a new revelation more than
[52:03] what is in the Bible
[52:07] if it is
[52:13] but I want to tell you this is
[52:20] God sends the prophet God says
[52:28] he doesn't come with a new message
[52:33] he comes with the message
[52:38] listen to what I said the message
[52:42] way you what is the message of the hour
[52:46] is the present truth
[52:51] what is the present truth
[52:55] there is only one truth
[52:58] that is Jesus Christ
[53:01] that is God himself
[53:04] he's the only truth I am the way I am
[53:08] the truth
[53:09] I am the life in every generation when a
[53:15] man comes on the scene
[53:17] do you know what he comes with you he
[53:21] comes with Jesus Christ Alone
[53:24] he points to Jesus
[53:27] not to an organization not to himself
[53:36] he points you to Jesus
[53:39] and that's how I'm able to know foreign
[53:59] Jesus Christ yes Christo is the same Yom
[54:04] help me finish it
[54:06] yesterday Joe and today and forever
[54:13] what is he trying to say
[54:16] the truth is the same
[54:19] yesterday John today and forever
[54:24] the truth can never change
[54:28] the truth will always be the same
[54:31] that's why when William Burnham came
[54:34] he said I preached what Paul preached
[54:41] the message
[54:44] is not a new truth
[54:53] but what our religions have done
[54:56] they have perverted that truth
[54:59] foreign
[55:14] but today you know the theologians
[55:19] they look into that Truth uh
[55:27] this one is no longer working
[55:31] let us change
[55:37] the place
[55:38] where it says talking is talking about
[55:40] the deacons
[55:45] wives
[55:47] for them they said let us write let us
[55:50] not read another Bible
[55:53] let us not do another Bible
[55:56] people will realize
[55:58] let us do another version like a Bible
[56:01] yes
[56:04] and then in our version
[56:07] Let Us remove a few scriptures
[56:19] to suit our teachings
[56:23] you know even the homosexuals have made
[56:26] a new Bible
[56:29] did you know the Bible which supports
[56:32] them
[56:35] that's the same way the women preachers
[56:42] just the same with those who don't
[56:44] believe in the Holy Ghost their own
[56:46] Bible versions
[56:50] foreign
[57:22] foreign
[57:50] [Music]
[57:54] foreign but you can even use father son
[57:57] Holy Spirit
[57:59] instead of Jesus Christ
[58:02] and now why does God need to send a
[58:05] prophets
[58:18] this message is not a new idea
[58:22] that's why I keep telling you it's not a
[58:24] new church
[58:35] and we who received it we are still
[58:38] contending for it now
[58:41] hallelujah amen the Bible says content
[58:45] for that Faith
[58:47] which was first given to the Saints
[58:51] we are contending for it
[58:54] by believing
[59:08] [Music]
[59:23] to restore us
[59:31] never not be
[59:33] hallelujah hallelujah so it's not a new
[59:37] idea
[59:39] they are the ones with a new idea
[59:42] it's not a new idea and I ask you a
[59:45] question now
[59:47] can there be more than one truth
[59:53] [Music]
[1:00:06] what we believe
[1:00:10] we cannot say it's always going to go on
[1:00:13] the rapture
[1:00:14] are going to be a part of our child
[1:00:21] cannot be denominated
[1:00:25] the message for example was like the uh
[1:00:28] Seventh-Day Adventists
[1:00:33] what does it mean it means for you to go
[1:00:36] to heaven
[1:00:37] you must join that nomination
[1:00:43] and you're a member of that denomination
[1:00:46] when Jesus comes you Rapture the members
[1:00:50] of that denomination
[1:01:01] he said my truth will remain
[1:01:04] I am going to send someone
[1:01:07] who is completely out of all their
[1:01:09] systems
[1:01:13] someone they can't understand
[1:01:16] someone is that is not loyal to them
[1:01:20] someone that is only loyal to me
[1:01:24] and I'm going to be bring my present
[1:01:26] truth to him
[1:01:28] and I will tell him to go to all of them
[1:01:33] and give them the presence
[1:01:37] my children who among them when they
[1:01:41] hear this present truth
[1:01:43] what will they here come out of her my
[1:01:47] people
[1:01:50] come out of denomination come out of the
[1:01:54] region come out of the systems
[1:01:57] come into the truth into Jesus Christ
[1:02:02] and this message has called us out
[1:02:06] this message has been sent to all the
[1:02:09] nominations
[1:02:11] and who are those going in the Rapture
[1:02:14] it doesn't matter whether
[1:02:17] they will hear this truth and they will
[1:02:20] believe it
[1:02:21] some of them may be in the mosque right
[1:02:23] now
[1:03:02] [Music]
[1:03:15] what do you tell them
[1:03:19] foreign
[1:03:36] you may be on the road
[1:03:40] but if you're fully convinced
[1:03:44] if you're fully convinced you are going
[1:03:48] to be concerned
[1:03:52] you're going to tell them you're going
[1:03:55] to tell them you're going to push them
[1:03:57] over Syndicate you're going to squeeze
[1:03:59] them over and you get you're going to do
[1:04:01] everything you can or connect your
[1:04:03] natural to bring in everybody you can
[1:04:30] but I'm presenting them to Jesus Christ
[1:04:35] are you not so happy to know that you
[1:04:38] are not members of this church
[1:04:41] but you are members of the body of Jesus
[1:04:43] Christ remember
[1:04:46] and how do you become a member of the
[1:04:48] body
[1:04:49] I believe in Jesus as your personal
[1:04:51] Savior
[1:04:53] by being baptized in much water I don't
[1:04:56] know that is and then he fills you with
[1:04:59] the Holy Ghost
[1:05:01] that one makes you a member
[1:05:05] of the body of Jesus Christ
[1:05:11] he will burn out those fleshly desires
[1:05:17] he will take you away from the world
[1:05:20] she will separate you from the world
[1:05:24] she will put you in love with him
[1:05:28] you will be reading the Bible
[1:05:35] foreign
[1:05:54] [Music]
[1:06:12] foreign
[1:06:28] I I read for you last time this quote I
[1:06:31] failed to read it again
[1:06:34] said not for one moment do I bring a
[1:06:37] message to the people that they may
[1:06:38] follow me again
[1:06:44] oh join my church
[1:06:46] so even you people who go to preach on
[1:06:49] the streets
[1:06:51] what is the target
[1:06:55] but the one that goes to so to do what
[1:06:57] they call witnessing
[1:07:01] I'm going to bring church members
[1:07:05] [Music]
[1:07:08] isn't it
[1:07:12] [Applause]
[1:07:24] but let me tell you
[1:07:27] the true bride of Jesus Christ
[1:07:30] is not going to do it that way yet again
[1:07:33] why do we evangelize
[1:07:36] why do we preach to the laws
[1:07:39] we have only one purpose it's not for
[1:07:43] them to join our church
[1:07:46] that is nothing
[1:07:48] you can join my church and still not go
[1:07:51] to the rapture
[1:07:54] we are going to preach to them
[1:07:56] so that we can introduce to them the
[1:07:59] present truth
[1:08:02] so that we can show them Jesus Christ
[1:08:07] according to his word
[1:08:09] so that we can tell them the Rapture is
[1:08:13] very soon
[1:08:14] the coming of the Lord is very soon
[1:08:17] so that we can tell them receive the
[1:08:21] Holy Ghost
[1:08:22] are you hearing me Church
[1:08:26] if they join our church
[1:08:28] it should only be for the purpose of
[1:08:31] them being continuing on on that road
[1:08:34] path of being encouraged to pursue that
[1:08:38] is
[1:08:43] so I I even wonder let us not just be
[1:08:46] church members
[1:08:48] let us be people here
[1:08:51] who have a purpose
[1:08:53] you know why we are here we are not here
[1:08:57] to field the church
[1:08:59] I don't care whether I'm preaching to
[1:09:01] two people or 100 people
[1:09:03] what I care about is the people who have
[1:09:06] a burden and the desire to go to the
[1:09:07] Rapture
[1:09:12] if I have five of them
[1:09:15] oh I'm very satisfied
[1:09:18] but I know they are not only five in
[1:09:21] this city
[1:09:22] they're more than 100. they're more than
[1:09:25] 200 foreign
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:52] Hallelujah man

[1:11:07] that choice instruments they have drums

[1:11:19] I said you church
[1:11:26] I've been purchased by anyone outside
[1:11:35] foreign
[1:11:53] but I'm trying to encourage you
[1:11:55] don't let your motive
[1:11:58] don't let your attitude
[1:12:00] don't let yourself
[1:12:10] we are not here for money
[1:12:13] because we have the truth to the
[1:12:15] generation
[1:12:18] are you hearing me chat you young men

[1:13:23] our generation
[1:13:27] you see
[1:13:29] when you talk about Abram we're gonna
[1:13:32] quit blame Abraham at his time
[1:13:35] he was the only reason yeah
[1:13:41] Hallelujah man
[1:13:44] that God did not destroyed
[1:13:54] he had already sent down the angels
[1:13:56] to go and destroy the city
[1:14:11] he couldn't find them
[1:14:13] foreign
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:55] [Music]
[1:15:22] tree and his family
[1:15:25] God told Abraham it's all right I'm not
[1:15:30] going to destroy them
[1:15:32] I'll send these angels take them out
[1:15:39] did you know there is something similar
[1:15:41] between Sodom and Gomorrah and today
[1:15:47] in the days
[1:15:54] straight with fire it is
[1:16:08] and you know as they were coming to the
[1:16:10] to the House of Lords
[1:16:12] some young men and old men saw them
[1:16:21] and they say and they ran into the into
[1:16:24] the house of lots and the Man Came oh we
[1:16:29] want to know the Lord said these are my
[1:16:32] guests
[1:16:33] you can't do this you know we want to
[1:16:36] know
[1:16:37] and so one angel or both of them I don't
[1:16:40] know they blinded them and of course
[1:16:42] brother speaks of this and he says this
[1:16:45] has already happened in our time
[1:16:48] there were three Angels one remained
[1:16:52] with a bride
[1:16:53] and two remained went to the solomona
[1:16:58] and we find that these ones who went to
[1:17:01] Sodom and come around
[1:17:02] they blinded these people
[1:17:06] by their message they blinded them they
[1:17:09] could do Miracles
[1:17:14] their signs and one that blinded them
[1:17:21] okay this is
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:49] [Music]
[1:18:13] [Music]
[1:18:21] what happened foreign
[1:18:42] would leave Catholicism
[1:18:48] saying that they're following the
[1:18:49] message
[1:18:52] no God is here among us
[1:18:58] and this is what has happened in our
[1:19:01] generation
[1:19:06] what did he do he designed Sarah's
[1:19:10] Hearts
[1:19:12] he called the new name of Abraham
[1:19:18] and what did he do there right there and
[1:19:21] then they had their body changes
[1:19:25] because of this Angel's message
[1:19:28] let me tell you we do in our generation
[1:19:31] we have received an end-time message
[1:19:35] no one has sent to us that Angels
[1:19:39] an angel means a messenger
[1:19:42] with a message
[1:20:08] Amen to prepare us for the coming of the
[1:20:11] Lord
[1:20:44] do we have anybody at all
[1:20:49] foreign
[1:21:00] [Music]
[1:21:02] foreign
[1:21:34] [Music]
[1:21:38] when Abraham received that message
[1:21:46] please come please
[1:22:23] the only thing I want to know about it
[1:22:27] is my messenger
[1:22:31] and I want to know the message
[1:22:34] because this is the message of my house
[1:22:41] I may never get it again
[1:22:43] brethren we have the message
[1:22:50] let us seize the moment
[1:22:53] and be serious
[1:22:58] I don't know if you are getting
[1:22:59] something
[1:23:02] so he said I'm not making a church
[1:23:07] some fellowship organization
[1:23:12] I have never done that and I will never
[1:23:14] do that
[1:23:16] I have no interest in those things
[1:23:18] but I do have an interest in the things
[1:23:21] of God and the people
[1:23:23] and if I can accomplish just one thing I
[1:23:26] would be satisfied
[1:23:29] that one thing is to see established a
[1:23:32] true spiritual relationship between God
[1:23:34] and Men
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:13] to establish a true spiritual
[1:24:16] relationship
[1:24:20] between God and Men
[1:24:23] where men become New Creations
[1:24:28] filled with the spirit
[1:24:30] and live according to the world
[1:24:34] so if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:24:37] you are not a part of those
[1:24:40] that have attained his purpose
[1:24:50] let me tell you if you don't have the
[1:24:52] Holy Spirit
[1:24:55] you need to know that you
[1:25:04] [Music]
[1:25:13] you
[1:25:16] will be
[1:25:20] okay
[1:25:22] forgive me for speaking please
[1:25:26] but I'm telling you the truth
[1:25:30] I believe you will love me better when I
[1:25:32] tell you the truth whether you're my
[1:25:35] brother whether my friends I'm telling
[1:25:38] you the truth
[1:25:46] don't just come to church for the sake
[1:25:49] of some
[1:25:50] of some associations
[1:25:56] to get a relationship with yourself
[1:25:59] whatever we do that is
[1:26:04] when we invite youth conferences that is
[1:26:07] the aim is
[1:26:10] we have free services in the week that
[1:26:12] is
[1:26:15] if we learn to pray that is
[1:26:20] to get a relationship with God
[1:26:23] to be filled with the Holy Spirit man
[1:26:30] the
[1:26:41] the Genesis chapter 6 verse 13 with
[1:26:44] Genesis chapter 6 and verses 13.
[1:26:50] and God said unto Noah the end of All
[1:26:53] Flesh has come before me for the Earth
[1:26:55] is filled with violence through them and
[1:26:57] be behold I will destroy them with the
[1:26:59] Earth make thee an arc of gopher wood
[1:27:01] rooms shall thou make in the ark and
[1:27:04] Shout preach it with within and without
[1:27:07] with Peach and this is the fashion which
[1:27:10] Thou shalt make it off the length of the
[1:27:13] ACT shall be 300 cubits the breadth of
[1:27:15] the Ark 50 qubits and the height of its
[1:27:18] uh of it 30 cubits a window shut down
[1:27:22] make to the ark and in a cubit shall
[1:27:25] thou finish it above and the door of the
[1:27:28] Ark shalt thou set in the side of
[1:27:30] thereof with lower second and third
[1:27:33] stories short thou make it and I be and
[1:27:36] behold I even I do bring a flood of
[1:27:39] waters upon the Earth To Destroy All
[1:27:42] Flesh water in is the Breath of Life
[1:27:44] from under heaven and everything that is
[1:27:47] in the Earth shall die
[1:27:49] but with thee will I establish my
[1:27:51] Covenant and thou shalt come into the
[1:27:54] ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and
[1:27:57] thy son his wives with thee
[1:27:59] and over there and of every living thing
[1:28:01] of All Flesh two of every thought shalt
[1:28:05] thou bring into the ark to keep them
[1:28:07] alive with thee they shall make they
[1:28:10] shall be mere and female or false after
[1:28:12] they are kind and of cut after they are
[1:28:14] kind and of every creeping thing of the
[1:28:16] earth after his kind two of every
[1:28:18] thought shall come unto thee to keep
[1:28:20] them alive and take thou unto thee of
[1:28:24] all food that is eaten and thou shalt
[1:28:27] gather it to thee and it shall be for
[1:28:29] food for thee and for them thus did Noah
[1:28:32] according to all that God commanded him
[1:28:34] so did he I see you've been reading
[1:28:39] now I want you to see that Noah had
[1:28:42] Specific Instructions
[1:28:48] when God told Noah to make the ark
[1:28:52] this was not a usual Act
[1:28:57] it was an arc with the instructions from
[1:29:01] God
[1:29:04] did not mind who agreed with him
[1:29:10] oh who disagree
[1:29:12] no I was only following one voice
[1:29:16] the voice of God
[1:29:18] instructed him and told him how the ACT
[1:29:21] should be
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:23] the type of wood
[1:29:26] type of Windows and everything is
[1:29:32] God had told him how it should be
[1:29:36] and why did God tell him to do this
[1:29:39] because God was telling Noah to prepare
[1:29:43] people because it was going to rain
[1:29:49] so what was the message of the hour at
[1:29:52] that time
[1:29:54] it is going to rain
[1:29:57] that was the message
[1:29:59] now many people do not believe it
[1:30:02] then everybody did not accept it
[1:30:04] one of the reasons why is because it had
[1:30:07] never happened before
[1:30:09] [Music]
[1:30:10] but with God there is no new thing under
[1:30:12] the Earth
[1:30:14] to God this was not true because it was
[1:30:17] out of the mouth of God
[1:30:21] it wasn't new
[1:30:23] because it was out of the mouth of God
[1:30:26] but it was true whatever God speaks is
[1:30:31] true
[1:30:33] there was no proof at the time that it
[1:30:35] could happen
[1:30:38] but building the ark was the only
[1:30:41] provided way in that day
[1:30:45] yeah
[1:30:48] and I want to say in every generation
[1:30:52] God has a provided
[1:30:55] he sends them the message
[1:31:08] that is very far away from their reality
[1:31:14] now the things that the Bible says
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:23] and real real woman
[1:31:29] says
[1:31:35] many of you think it is teaching
[1:31:41] can I tell you today
[1:31:43] it is it has nothing to do with William
[1:31:45] Brothers
[1:31:51] I've discussed this with some of you
[1:31:55] where he said under no circumstances
[1:32:23] that is not here
[1:32:58] because we know that the Israel was
[1:33:01] natural but for us we Are Spiritual
[1:33:03] Church
[1:33:30] did you hear that
[1:33:33] who are they barely bound to church they
[1:33:36] were Canaanites
[1:33:38] they were not of their
[1:33:40] [Music]
[1:33:41] um
[1:33:42] of their tribe of their lineage
[1:33:45] and he wanted to marry from a manga he
[1:33:48] is
[1:33:51] and it was a very important thing
[1:33:56] he said to Elias
[1:34:02] but it was a very difficult thing
[1:34:06] the place where he was going to go look
[1:34:08] for a wife
[1:34:18] because he gave his word
[1:34:20] he believed in God
[1:34:24] foreign
[1:34:47] was it what he did
[1:34:50] he went in one corner I know we again
[1:34:54] and he prayed he said God
[1:34:58] have mercy on me
[1:35:01] I asked for a sign
[1:35:04] that one sister
[1:35:08] that will come
[1:35:11] and I will ask her
[1:35:14] to water my camels to give me water to
[1:35:18] drink
[1:35:18] [Music]
[1:35:19] and she also Waters my camels
[1:35:28] ah that will be a sign Lord
[1:35:31] is the one you have given me for my
[1:35:34] masters
[1:35:42] the Bible doesn't say that she tried
[1:35:44] very many
[1:35:45] again
[1:35:48] he just stood there yeah
[1:35:51] and was looking
[1:35:57] and when her his heart move
[1:36:00] um
[1:36:11] foreign
[1:36:51] from the beginning
[1:36:53] is the same
[1:36:55] who gave wives
[1:37:03] if we follow the same way
[1:37:07] the same conditions
[1:37:10] that somebody else
[1:37:13] we need the same conditions
[1:37:18] God will do the same thing
[1:37:22] that he did for them
[1:37:25] oh if he doesn't do it he did the
[1:37:29] mistake in the beginning
[1:37:33] do you know you have a right to tell him
[1:37:35] um
[1:37:40] I'm like so and so in the Bible
[1:37:44] I don't have a child on my own and yet
[1:37:48] I'm married
[1:37:49] now let me go to church and pray
[1:37:52] come and pray and pray and then you say
[1:37:55] God I've made the same condition
[1:37:58] um
[1:38:00] and you take that from your heart
[1:38:04] yourself
[1:38:08] if God doesn't give you a child
[1:38:10] like he gave to Hannah
[1:38:13] either you've not met the same condition
[1:38:18] oh God did the mistake
[1:38:23] that's got the mistakes
[1:38:26] is it the same
[1:38:28] um
[1:38:28] he will do the same thing over and over
[1:38:30] he will never get gathered because of
[1:38:32] the same God
[1:38:33] College in the church
[1:38:36] meet the conditions
[1:38:39] and then see if God will not
[1:38:41] do the same thing
[1:38:44] that's the good thing about our God
[1:38:47] by the way let me tell you church as I'm
[1:38:49] finishing our God is very predictable
[1:38:52] cartoon
[1:38:56] very predictive
[1:39:00] foreign
[1:39:25] what
[1:39:32] are you hearing me
[1:39:34] don't it's only you is unpredictable
[1:39:38] God is only counting on you all your
[1:39:42] choices and decisions
[1:39:46] why am I saying You can predict God
[1:39:50] go in the Bible
[1:39:52] read character after character
[1:39:57] this one did this okay
[1:40:03] and God has always done the same thing
[1:40:07] no new things
[1:40:10] so friends even in marriage
[1:40:14] You can predict God
[1:40:17] before you are disappointed with God
[1:40:20] to the scriptures
[1:40:23] all those people who got married
[1:40:45] [Music]
[1:41:17] but like I say this is just the
[1:41:19] beginning I I trust that God will help
[1:41:21] us to get deeper and deeper into the
[1:41:23] subject and see of course as much as he
[1:41:25] wants you to get you will get let us
