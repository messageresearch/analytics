[1:22:34] well and I really found that they are
[1:22:37] True Believers of this
[1:22:38] [Music]
[1:22:40] message so I I I
[1:22:43] discovered that they are as lovely as
[1:22:46] they as they are
[1:22:50] anointed and I I thought it would be
[1:22:54] wonderful for Brother David to come and
[1:22:57] minister to the young people
[1:22:59] here and I know many are not yet
[1:23:02] here but I also am aware that many are

[1:33:46] something the government can call it the
[1:33:49] pearl of
[1:33:50] Africa
[1:33:52] but what they miss to
[1:33:54] see is that by God's
[1:33:57] grace I am standing before a portion of
