[35:06] [Music]
[35:13] let us go to our scriptures now
[35:18] in the book of second Corinthians
[35:20] chapter 5.
[35:39] we are reading from verses we're just
[35:42] reading one verse and then we shall
[35:43] visited verse 20.
[35:58] now then we are ambassadors for Christ
[36:02] as though God did beseech You by us
[36:07] we pray you in Christ's state
[36:10] be ye reconciled
[36:13] to God
[36:15] let's pray father Lord we just want to
[36:17] commit this reading of the word into
[36:20] your hands Lord the scripture we have
[36:21] read and more that we shall read in this
[36:24] service we commit them into your hands
[36:27] Lord may may tonight be a blessing
[36:29] father as it has already been now as we
[36:32] are going to share a little portion of
[36:34] scripture and I thought your people I
[36:36] pray that you anoint me and that you
[36:38] will make it a blessing to each and
[36:40] every one of us in Jesus name
[36:42] amen you may be seated
[36:50] so
[36:51] I'm speaking to you today on a thought
[36:54] ambassadors of the Kingdom
[36:57] anybody that does not understand English
[37:00] if you can lift up your hand
[37:03] well I trust we are good to go
[37:06] so uh tonight I just want to have a
[37:09] little thought with you something that
[37:12] the Holy Spirit made real to me
[37:15] today and I want to share it with you
[37:18] just to encourage you more especially in
[37:22] in our prayer meeting and then I know by
[37:24] the time I'm done we might not have much
[37:26] time of prayer but at least we will have
[37:28] a little time to
[37:29] once again speak to the Lord we've
[37:31] already worshiped him and a meeting is
[37:34] not done without the word being shared
[37:37] amen
[37:39] So speaking about an ambassador
[37:43] an ambassador is someone that
[37:47] is representing a country or a state in
[37:52] a foreign land
[37:53] if you go to the American Embassy you
[37:56] will find an ambassador there is the
[37:58] American ambassador is representing the
[38:00] president of America
[38:02] and
[38:05] are you the one I think you are
[38:07] God bless you yes you're welcome back
[38:11] from school actually both of you you're
[38:14] welcome God bless you so
[38:17] um uh talking about an ambassador an
[38:19] ambassador is someone that
[38:21] represents as
[38:24] a government
[38:26] and is speaking or rather doing whatever
[38:30] is doing on behalf of that government or
[38:32] a kingdom in that matter in the in the
[38:35] past used to be kingdoms not governments
[38:38] like it is today but of course our
[38:39] kingdom is a government so now the Bible
[38:41] says now then we are ambassadors brother
[38:44] if you can project those verses we are
[38:46] ambassadors for Christ we are
[38:49] ambassadors for Christ can we all say we
[38:52] are ambassadors for Christ
[38:55] so that's what I'm speaking on tonight
[38:57] ambassadors of the kingdom of course the
[38:59] kingdom of Christ is not the kingdom of
[39:01] the world but the kingdom of of God the
[39:04] Kingdom of Heaven in Proverbs 13 17
[39:08] up to 18 it says a wicked messenger
[39:11] falleth into mischief but a faithful
[39:14] Ambassador is health
[39:17] poverty and shame shall be to him that
[39:20] refuses instruction but he that regards
[39:24] reproof shall be honored now the
[39:27] scripture here speaks about a wicked
[39:29] messenger
[39:30] falling into mischief
[39:33] and a faithful Ambassador is the health
[39:36] now we need to understand about an
[39:38] ambassador in one sense is also a
[39:40] messenger
[39:42] amen
[39:43] an ambassador is also a messenger a
[39:47] messenger that has been sent like I told
[39:50] you he's been sent by his government to
[39:52] represent his government in another
[39:54] kingdom or in another government so now
[39:56] the Bible here calls him a messenger in
[39:59] Proverbs and he says but a wicked
[40:01] messenger falls into Mischief so meaning
[40:03] you can be an ambassador but a wicked
[40:05] one
[40:06] you can be a messenger but a wicked one
[40:09] meaning not doing exactly not
[40:10] representing your country well not
[40:12] representing your kingdom in the right
[40:15] way
[40:16] and then he says but a faithful
[40:18] Ambassador is Health now this is where
[40:20] the health here
[40:22] I know the Bible uses it in many other
[40:24] verses but one of it that the Bible uses
[40:27] it is where he says that God wants us to
[40:31] be uh to prosper a also in health so
[40:36] when when it comes to health here he's
[40:37] talking about Prosperity he's talking
[40:40] about uh increase he's talking about a
[40:44] good life he's talking about blessings
[40:46] he's talking about success
[40:48] so a faithful Ambassador is going to be
[40:51] successful as success a faithful
[40:53] Ambassador is going to progress a
[40:56] faithful Ambassador is going to increase
[40:59] our faithful Ambassador is going to be
[41:01] blessed a faithful Ambassador is going
[41:04] to not be poor okay and faithful
[41:07] Ambassador is going to be blessed amen
[41:09] so now here the Bible says Verse 18
[41:11] poverty and shame shall be to him that
[41:16] refuses instruction
[41:18] straight away after he talks about our
[41:20] faithful Ambassador being rich or
[41:22] successful all Progressive he talks
[41:26] about now poverty and shame
[41:28] coming to him that refuses instruction
[41:31] now you need to understand that an
[41:33] ambassador does not act on his own
[41:36] behalf an ambassador acts on the behalf
[41:39] of his president he represents his
[41:41] president to act on his behalf so an
[41:45] ambassador really executes
[41:48] the duties that he is instructed by his
[41:51] president to do are you following me so
[41:53] if his president gives him an
[41:55] instruction and he tells him do ABCD and
[41:58] for him he doesn't hear instruction he
[42:00] doesn't follow what is president or what
[42:03] his leader told him
[42:05] according to the Bible poverty and shame
[42:07] shall be to him
[42:10] now you don't want to have poverty and
[42:12] shame
[42:13] you want to have increase and blessings
[42:16] praise the name of the Lord you want to
[42:18] have what
[42:20] and
[42:21] blessings you want to have the riches
[42:24] that Christ gives you want to increase
[42:27] in everything that you do you want to
[42:30] prosper in everything that you do
[42:32] you want to see the hand of God being
[42:36] open to you the blessing of God being
[42:39] open to you but that cannot happen
[42:41] unless you are a faithful ambassador now
[42:45] we in the same way we have a kingdom our
[42:48] kingdom is not of this world our kingdom
[42:51] is of above and Jesus Christ is our
[42:55] leader is our president he has sent us
[42:58] on a mission down here on the earth to
[43:00] be ambassadors of the Kingdom so we are
[43:03] representing him here did you know that
[43:05] wherever you are wherever you are you
[43:08] are representing the body of Jesus
[43:11] Christ
[43:12] whatever you are it doesn't matter where
[43:14] you are it might be at school it might
[43:17] be at your place of work it might be
[43:20] on the road it might no matter where you
[43:23] are today remember where you have been
[43:25] the whole of today wherever you have
[43:27] been wherever you have been you've been
[43:30] a representative of the body of Jesus
[43:32] Christ
[43:33] now if the things that you did was not
[43:37] according to his instruction he that
[43:40] sent us down here represented him you
[43:42] are not a faithful ambassador
[43:45] that's bad news isn't it
[43:48] but may God help you if you've not been
[43:50] a faithful ambassador from today from
[43:52] the service tonight that you will walk
[43:54] away and say I want to be a faithful
[43:56] ambassador
[43:58] praise the name of the Lord
[44:00] because you don't want to shove to
[44:02] suffer poverty and shame but you want to
[44:04] suffer Faith increase and success
[44:08] now I have the rest of the things that I
[44:11] have to read for you those are the two
[44:13] scriptures I wanted to read for you but
[44:14] I I have almost three or four pages
[44:18] from the message influence influences
[44:21] I've already lost my voice so I pray
[44:22] that you'll be able I will be able to
[44:24] speak well or through for about 50
[44:26] minutes or so now
[44:29] from the message influences 1964 I'm
[44:32] going to recommend you to go and listen
[44:33] to that message or to go and read it
[44:36] I hope that we are message readers
[44:40] if you don't read the message or you
[44:42] don't listen to the message you cannot
[44:43] grow
[44:44] if you don't read the Bible you cannot
[44:46] grow
[44:48] as a Christian you need to read your
[44:49] Bible and listen to the message at least
[44:52] every day that will help you to have
[44:54] your spiritual masses to grow in the
[44:58] things of God you need to keep plugged
[45:00] in amen
[45:03] speaks about many things but uh I want
[45:06] to read for you a few
[45:08] um a few paragraphs like I said it's
[45:10] about four pages but that will be all I
[45:13] will share tonight and then we shall go
[45:14] in prayer
[45:15] so
[45:18] um brother if you can give me this quote
[45:19] on the screen so that the people can
[45:21] follow me now is first of all he talks
[45:23] about the President Abraham Lincoln this
[45:26] was the president of America he says now
[45:28] I think the greatest president though
[45:31] that we
[45:33] that we talking about the Americans ever
[45:35] had was Abraham Lincoln
[45:38] not because he was a Kentucky and two
[45:40] because brother Banner was at a Kentucky
[45:42] and
[45:44] would say that the greatest person to
[45:47] have ever had is a Young Southern Man
[45:50] Who was a minion called so brother is
[45:52] saying not because he was not because he
[45:53] was a Kentucky and but he listened to
[45:56] how he gauges him
[45:58] but it was because that the man come up
[46:02] from nothing
[46:04] and all the books that man that that man
[46:07] ever owned from the time he was a
[46:10] younger boy until he was of age
[46:13] God bless you I needed this so badly
[46:16] excuse me
[46:21] and he says and all the books that a man
[46:23] ever owned
[46:25] from the time he was a young boy until
[46:27] he was of age almost was the Bible and
[46:30] the bunion is Pilgrims Progress now he's
[46:34] talking about the former or one of the
[46:37] first presidents if not the first
[46:39] of the US United States
[46:42] and he says
[46:45] the man came up from nothing and he
[46:47] talks about the books that this man ever
[46:50] owned the books that this man read the
[46:52] books that this man had were two books
[46:55] from the time he was a little baby
[46:57] one was the Bible
[46:59] and another one was this book called
[47:01] Pilgrim's Progress
[47:03] how men have read that book or how many
[47:05] have watched the film Pilgrim's Progress
[47:09] now you young men and ladies that have
[47:12] not watched this and have not read this
[47:14] I don't know what you use your free time
[47:15] for
[47:16] these are some of the books that you
[47:18] ought to have already known because as a
[47:19] Believer I expect if you want to watch a
[47:21] movie or something or a film
[47:24] or a video you should you should want to
[47:26] watch things that are
[47:28] okay for your eyes as a Believer so you
[47:31] as a young person I remember when I
[47:33] first came into the message when I
[47:34] wanted to watch I wanted to know what
[47:36] can I watch as I believe and these are
[47:37] this is one of the things I watched so
[47:40] you should find it
[47:42] Pilgrims Progress
[47:44] it is a very good book it was a book but
[47:46] then they acted a movie out of it very
[47:48] good book
[47:49] I will not give the story of the book if
[47:51] you want to to know it those who have
[47:54] watched it raise up your hand so that
[47:55] you can see them and then ask them the
[47:57] details raise up your hand up high so
[47:59] look around look around those of you who
[48:01] have not watched it then after the
[48:02] service meet them and ask them where can
[48:05] I find it now see he says that he
[48:08] watched he read the Bible and he he read
[48:10] that book also and he says you see
[48:13] that molded into him
[48:17] what you read what you do modes your
[48:21] character
[48:23] what you'd read molds your character
[48:26] tell someone what you read about your
[48:28] character
[48:30] and that's the truth
[48:32] it molds your character it tells what
[48:34] you are
[48:36] and now you see you see that's why
[48:39] sincerely as Believers when you before
[48:42] you believed you were reading some of
[48:43] those magazines brother when I'm talking
[48:44] please put this off so before you
[48:47] believe you were reading some of those
[48:50] magazines we call it data magazines like
[48:53] red pepper and reading some of those old
[48:56] data novels and things like that these
[49:01] days people don't like reading they
[49:02] watch more than reading but whatever it
[49:03] is whether reading or watching
[49:06] you're up that should change the things
[49:08] that you were doing remember you were an
[49:09] ambassador the things that you were
[49:11] doing then should not be what exactly
[49:12] what you're doing now what is the
[49:14] problem with reading or watching there
[49:16] is no problem with reading or watching
[49:17] but the question is what are you reading
[49:19] and watching what you're reading and
[49:20] watching is molding your character if
[49:23] it's not molding your character towards
[49:24] loving God more and representing the
[49:26] kingdom of God more it is molding your
[49:28] character into loving the world more and
[49:30] representing the devil more so may God
[49:32] help us
[49:34] and he says
[49:36] it tells you what you are and now you
[49:38] see he read where if you did wrong you
[49:40] paid for it if you did right God would
[49:43] honor it and that modeled him what he
[49:46] was and his mother a Godly woman too he
[49:49] said if there is any credit given
[49:51] anybody it was a Godly mother
[49:54] that raised him right now that made I
[49:58] think I would say at least one if not
[50:01] the greatest president that we had he
[50:04] come up from nothing and God made him
[50:05] president because he was an honest man
[50:08] and a good man
[50:11] do you want to be blessed by God you
[50:14] should be honest and good
[50:17] you should represent the kingdom of God
[50:18] where
[50:20] you should not do what the world does
[50:22] you should be different
[50:25] I hope that this message is arriving
[50:26] home I have very little voice to tonight
[50:28] but I hope it's arriving well
[50:30] at home in your heart so this man became
[50:33] a president actually God can make you
[50:34] anything you want to be
[50:36] anything in this world but it is it
[50:39] should be and it must be on the basis
[50:41] that you are unharnessed and a good man
[50:45] and now he says now we find that this
[50:47] boy was the same having these Godly
[50:49] Parents he did that which was right when
[50:53] he was made the king and when he was 16
[50:56] years old he ignored all the politics
[50:58] and the popular opinions of his day and
[51:01] served god with reverence oh may God
[51:04] help us I I love these things I love
[51:07] this quote as I was reading I said to
[51:08] myself I'm going to read it all to you
[51:10] Sister Sister Lisa sent this to me a
[51:12] little portion not this one but a little
[51:14] bit below and it had quite a lot of
[51:19] a substance and I thought I should share
[51:21] it with you tonight in our prayer
[51:22] meeting so please listen to that I'm
[51:24] sure it will be a blessing to you
[51:26] and he says when he was a meta King and
[51:29] he was 16 years old he ignored all the
[51:33] politics and the popular opinions of his
[51:34] days talking about here king a king who
[51:36] was called uzia in the Bible
[51:39] he ignored all the politics and the
[51:41] popular opinions of his day and he
[51:43] served god with reverence that made him
[51:45] a real king to ignore the politics and
[51:48] the modern opinion and served god with
[51:51] reverence that was very good his kingdom
[51:54] God blessed it it was so great till it
[51:58] was the next to solomonies and Saul and
[52:01] Solomon had the greatest that there was
[52:03] but this boy was next to Solomon in his
[52:06] kingdom it was a great help to the young
[52:09] prophet Isaiah and him being a younger
[52:12] chap at that time just coming on being
[52:15] born a prophet he was the influence that
[52:17] this man had upon the people and seen
[52:20] where his influence come from because he
[52:22] trusted God emphatically
[52:25] emphatically please follow me here now
[52:28] many people would say even they've come
[52:31] to me many in my life time not very long
[52:35] but in my lifetime many have come to me
[52:37] and said
[52:39] I like the way God has blessed you I
[52:41] like the way you are I like your life
[52:43] I'd like to be like you what can I do to
[52:45] be like you and then I've told them I've
[52:48] showed them the way of of God and the
[52:50] way of the word but not very many are
[52:52] interested on that part
[52:54] but here we find that Isaiah
[52:57] um Isaiah
[53:00] looked at he was here and he said he
[53:03] watched the influence that this man had
[53:05] upon the people and he seen where his
[53:07] influence come from because he trusted
[53:10] God emphatically
[53:11] if you see all of us have role models in
[53:14] this life of course apart from Jesus
[53:15] Jesus should be our main role model if
[53:18] you see a man or a woman if you're a
[53:20] sister that accept God or has lived for
[53:23] God and God has blessed them you should
[53:25] want to be maybe if you want to be like
[53:26] them
[53:27] that's not the thing you can be like
[53:29] them or even better but the question is
[53:31] are you ready
[53:34] to do
[53:35] what they did
[53:37] because he trusted God
[53:39] this was he had trusted God you are you
[53:43] ready to trust God ask yourself that
[53:45] question am I ready to trust to God are
[53:47] you ready to trust God in everything
[53:48] that you are doing or you want to trust
[53:50] man
[53:52] and he noticed again Isaiah did how that
[53:55] God will bless them that will be true to
[53:58] God this word God must bless those that
[54:00] are true to God is what it is a must for
[54:03] God to bless them let me tell you if you
[54:05] are true to God this word and God
[54:07] doesn't blessed you hey
[54:10] then I'm going to give you a right to
[54:12] question him
[54:13] tell me one man in the Bible that was
[54:15] true to God this word and God did not
[54:16] bless them every man and woman that was
[54:19] true to God is what God blessed them God
[54:21] blessed them God keeps his word God
[54:24] keeps his appointments it is people that
[54:26] don't but God is faithful God keeps his
[54:29] word if all of us were true to God this
[54:31] word I we should we will be walking in
[54:34] blessings we will be walking in power we
[54:36] will be working in Victory
[54:39] and he says now we realize that this
[54:41] younger fellow wanted to stay with the
[54:43] principles of what God Said
[54:46] he kept his laws uziya wouldn't turn
[54:49] right or left he stayed right with what
[54:52] the word of God said and God honored him
[54:54] and blessed him in everything he done he
[54:58] prospered he went right on hmm what an
[55:01] example that it is for any young person
[55:05] now let me tell you this is the way you
[55:08] see many people today of course as the
[55:10] modern Trends every day has its own
[55:12] modern Trends as modern Trends come up
[55:15] and you know you know civilization
[55:18] increase people always think that the
[55:20] ones in the past were backward and they
[55:24] think that the ones who are updated so
[55:27] when you talk about something when you
[55:28] talk about something that is in God is
[55:29] what people laugh at you and when people
[55:32] laugh at you feel bad and shame and then
[55:34] you stop talking about God's word
[55:37] are you hearing me are you hearing me if
[55:41] you're hearing me say Amen
[55:43] that happens many times especially the
[55:45] young people of course then you stop
[55:47] talking about God is word and then the
[55:49] word is called assimilate then you begin
[55:51] to assimilate
[55:57] you know
[55:59] you begin to assimilate you begin to
[56:01] look like them you begin to do what they
[56:03] do in order to pick their attention
[56:06] see if someone is dressing if they're
[56:08] dressing a skirt which is skimpy above
[56:12] the knee then you will also begin to do
[56:14] that because you need to assimilate to
[56:15] look like them so you don't feel ashamed
[56:19] but give me one younger man a young
[56:22] person or give me any person any
[56:24] Christian that will stand for God's word
[56:27] and see if God will not bless them in
[56:29] everything they will do
[56:31] they will prosper oh my God if I if I I
[56:34] was you sitting there I would say Amen
[56:36] I will prosper
[56:38] that's how I'm saying this they went
[56:41] right on he said what an example it is
[56:43] for any young person if you want
[56:44] Prosperity that's prosperity for you
[56:45] follow the word of God follow what the
[56:47] word of God says even if it is not
[56:48] acceptable before others if it's
[56:50] acceptable before God God will bless you
[56:52] for doing that and he says I think if we
[56:55] had we had people today
[56:57] our churches who claim to be Christians
[56:59] if they would abstain from the things of
[57:02] the world and live that kind of a life
[57:05] it would influence the younger
[57:07] Christians to do so do you know we have
[57:09] all these people who are joining this
[57:10] church
[57:12] let me tell you do you know that people
[57:13] who join the church
[57:15] younger believers
[57:16] I'm not talking about younger in age I'm
[57:18] talking about young because they've just
[57:19] believed if they join the church they
[57:22] are going to watch or look at you who
[57:24] has already been here did you know that
[57:29] what I'm saying
[57:31] they're going to look at you sister said
[57:33] I'm happy to see you they're going to
[57:34] look at you they're going to look at you
[57:36] brother they're going to look at you
[57:39] and you see let me tell you the gospel
[57:41] we preach it is not much about what we
[57:44] talk about on the pulpit it's about your
[57:47] life
[57:49] the life that you live the life that you
[57:51] keep in your everyday day-to-day life
[57:55] is what is going to tell people what we
[57:56] are preaching here
[57:59] now
[58:00] if your life is wish you worship if you
[58:04] are doing things the way that you have
[58:05] even they who are just coming you're not
[58:07] doing they're not going to see the
[58:08] difference and do you know you have
[58:10] influenced them the wrong way and do you
[58:12] know you're going to be answerable for
[58:13] that
[58:15] do you know you're going to be
[58:16] answerable for that
[58:21] they would abstain
[58:22] from the things of the world and live
[58:24] that kind of a life it will it would
[58:26] influence the younger Christian to do so
[58:29] but today when they let down and drink
[58:31] and smoke and carry on meaning the
[58:34] Christians and they still try to hold
[58:36] their confession as Christianity
[58:38] that puts a bad stumbling block in other
[58:41] people's way and it makes it very hard
[58:44] you see how we should hold ourselves how
[58:48] we should behave what what kind of life
[58:50] we should live
[58:51] and then he says remember the Bible said
[58:53] you are leaving you are written a piece
[58:56] as read of all man now many people want
[58:58] to read the Bible but God has made you a
[59:01] living representative a living
[59:03] Ambassador many people will not read the
[59:05] Bible but you are the Bible they will
[59:06] ever read did you know that
[59:08] you were their Bible
[59:10] as you are working you are the working
[59:12] Bible
[59:13] you see you are the working Bible
[59:16] that people will ever read
[59:18] they were from the way you trim your
[59:21] hair
[59:22] to the way you dream you dream your
[59:23] fingernails
[59:25] to the way you dress to the way you talk
[59:29] to the way you do everything
[59:35] you do people are going to look at you
[59:38] and they're going to be the president
[59:40] you're going to represent the kingdom
[59:42] now I want you to ask yourself a
[59:44] question have you been a good
[59:45] representative
[59:48] you are walking yeah let us continue you
[59:50] are working late I'm just reading this
[59:52] quote for you
[59:53] you are working letter but I want to
[59:55] read it slowly so it can end up properly
[59:57] he says you are working later
[1:00:02] should be a working Bible
[1:00:05] Christ in you you should be a walking
[1:00:08] Bible Christ in you
[1:00:11] someone may never take this Bible and
[1:00:13] open it read what is there but let them
[1:00:16] look at your life and let it be enough
[1:00:18] for them to know I believe in Jesus
[1:00:20] Christ
[1:00:21] you should be the working word of God
[1:00:23] and if you profess to be a Christian and
[1:00:26] not that
[1:00:28] your influence what's your what are you
[1:00:31] influencing
[1:00:32] will make you have to answer for many
[1:00:36] Souls that you've turned aside
[1:00:38] that you've turned away from Christ in
[1:00:41] that day of the Judgment did you know
[1:00:43] that did you know can you believe it
[1:00:45] the things that you do of course of
[1:00:47] course if I do this it doesn't take me
[1:00:49] to Hell let me tell you
[1:00:50] if you do things that will influence
[1:00:52] others from Living God and they go to
[1:00:54] hell where do you think you will go you
[1:00:56] will follow them and you will be
[1:00:57] together with them why because you'll
[1:00:58] have to answer for those Souls that you
[1:01:00] turned aside
[1:01:04] and he says I think it behooves us
[1:01:06] tonight to think about that for every
[1:01:09] man woman boy God knows that you are
[1:01:13] coming to the Judgment every one of us
[1:01:15] you're going to come to the judgment you
[1:01:18] might escape this that or the other and
[1:01:21] he says you might be beat at the income
[1:01:22] tax you might use
[1:01:26] you might escape the entire Revenue you
[1:01:28] might do this or another you might have
[1:01:30] run over the speed limit and the cops
[1:01:33] never catch you
[1:01:35] um
[1:01:38] you know
[1:01:40] or you can you can do your own zigzags
[1:01:43] in the church and the pastor and the
[1:01:44] deacons may never catch you
[1:01:46] and you are still one of us and you're a
[1:01:48] Believer no problem he says that's all
[1:01:50] right but one day judgment is going to
[1:01:53] catch you that is Saturn
[1:01:58] and we know that man must die and after
[1:02:02] that there
[1:02:05] let me read this again can we read it
[1:02:07] together and we know that man must die
[1:02:11] and after that
[1:02:13] the Judgment now the problem is not
[1:02:15] dying everyone is going to die but the
[1:02:17] problem is that judgment part
[1:02:20] everyone must come to that place of
[1:02:22] judgment oh my God have mercy
[1:02:27] he says it's the Judgment after death
[1:02:30] that is the blood is the bad part
[1:02:32] and there
[1:02:33] what you've done on on life and how
[1:02:37] you've influenced others you'll have to
[1:02:39] answer for it at that day now let me
[1:02:41] tell you let me tell you listen
[1:02:44] that is why if you're a child of God and
[1:02:46] God wants you to go to the rapture
[1:02:48] and you do wrong with things he will not
[1:02:51] leave you to die before you correct them
[1:02:56] if you have ever been corrected either
[1:02:58] by someone seeing a vision about you or
[1:03:00] you've done something wrong and it comes
[1:03:02] up or you know you know or you spill
[1:03:05] some milk and someone understands or you
[1:03:07] stole this and someone or you did this
[1:03:09] and someone finds out and then you know
[1:03:10] you know the the pastor finds out that
[1:03:13] Deacon finds out and this and that and
[1:03:15] then you are corrected and here on Earth
[1:03:17] brother rejoice
[1:03:19] because you are a seed of God
[1:03:22] doesn't want you to go to hell that's
[1:03:24] why he's exposing you so you can be
[1:03:27] corrected here because he says judgment
[1:03:29] begins where
[1:03:31] what's up God
[1:03:32] but let me take this and I don't want to
[1:03:34] preach I want to read this quote to you
[1:03:36] he says
[1:03:41] and we know that man must die and after
[1:03:45] that the Judgment death is not a hard
[1:03:47] thing it's the Judgment after the death
[1:03:49] that's the bad part they had the bad
[1:03:51] part and there what you've done on life
[1:03:53] and how you have influenced others you
[1:03:56] will have to answer for it at that day
[1:03:58] brother sister when you find a brother
[1:04:01] or a sister in the wrong don't be quiet
[1:04:04] go and tell them
[1:04:08] no you're going to answer
[1:04:11] if you see someone doing something wrong
[1:04:13] and you let them continue you're going
[1:04:15] to also answer for it did you know the
[1:04:17] Bible says you will answer because their
[1:04:18] blood is upon you you've seen them doing
[1:04:20] something wrong and you didn't correct
[1:04:21] them
[1:04:22] but if someone is doing something wrong
[1:04:24] and you go straight to them not to
[1:04:27] another person again that's what the
[1:04:28] Mystic people do don't go to another
[1:04:30] person if you have seen a praise here
[1:04:33] doing something don't run to Peter or
[1:04:35] don't want to Marvin come to praise tell
[1:04:37] him praise what you are doing is not
[1:04:39] according to the word
[1:04:40] of course you may be proud oh well
[1:04:43] don't worry about his pride show him the
[1:04:46] scripture if he doesn't see it walk away
[1:04:48] you've done your part
[1:04:50] you're not going to serve people we are
[1:04:52] not people's savior we we are we are
[1:04:55] preaching we are telling them we are
[1:04:57] living our life before them and that's
[1:04:58] all we can do God must serve them if
[1:05:01] they're savable
[1:05:02] are you hearing me
[1:05:04] now if you are corrected if you are on
[1:05:06] the other side and you are corrected
[1:05:07] don't begin to have pride that's why
[1:05:10] even God doesn't answer your prayers
[1:05:11] because of Pride as we shall sit down
[1:05:13] here because of Pride you think oh I
[1:05:15] have arrived I'm a Christian I am not
[1:05:17] I'm going to hell that is already
[1:05:19] approved I'm a seed of God I'm
[1:05:21] predestinated or before the foundation
[1:05:22] of the world God knew me therefore and
[1:05:25] someone comes and tells you brother
[1:05:26] sister you have done this wrong
[1:05:28] you think that that would take me to
[1:05:30] help to Hell people are so much worried
[1:05:32] about going to hell they think even when
[1:05:34] they do things and they it won't take
[1:05:36] them to hell they think that that is
[1:05:39] okay
[1:05:39] listen a mature Christian a mature
[1:05:42] believer must reach a level whereby it's
[1:05:45] not about hell that you are fearing
[1:05:47] I'm not doing things so I don't have to
[1:05:49] go to hell or Heaven
[1:05:51] Heaven is already assured but here the
[1:05:54] things I am doing I am worried about
[1:05:56] being a good ambassador
[1:05:58] and why because I don't want to run poor
[1:06:01] I don't want to become poor I don't want
[1:06:03] to to be ashamed I want like we have
[1:06:06] seen I want to prosper I want to have
[1:06:08] success are you following me so so in
[1:06:11] other words I'm going to be so much
[1:06:13] concerned about pleasing the Lord and
[1:06:16] being a good Ambassador and following
[1:06:18] every instruction he has given me even I
[1:06:20] want to do more above and beyond more
[1:06:23] than what he has told me in the line of
[1:06:25] what he has told me so that when he
[1:06:27] meets me he will say Well done good and
[1:06:30] faithful servant
[1:06:32] are you hearing me Church
[1:06:34] so
[1:06:35] we don't do things because of fear of
[1:06:38] hell we do things because of the love of
[1:06:41] Jesus in our hearts
[1:06:43] now then here he continues on to say
[1:06:46] where where are we
[1:06:49] how much more out we should set aside
[1:06:51] every weight and the sin
[1:06:54] does that does so easily beset us that
[1:06:57] we might run with the patience this rest
[1:06:59] that is set before us looking not to the
[1:07:02] Creed
[1:07:03] but today or to the domination to some
[1:07:05] other person but to Jesus Christ who is
[1:07:09] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:07:11] that is our president we are the
[1:07:12] ambassadors hallelujah how we should
[1:07:15] think them things friends stunnally and
[1:07:19] reverently as we see this day
[1:07:22] approaching
[1:07:23] and knowing that anytime your life's
[1:07:25] Pages the book may be closed tonight
[1:07:28] this when I read it
[1:07:31] I first held my peace for a moment and I
[1:07:35] read it again about three times
[1:07:38] it was just very real let me read it
[1:07:40] again
[1:07:41] how we should think them things friends
[1:07:44] stunnally and reverently again
[1:07:50] as we see this day approaching and
[1:07:53] knowing that any time your life's Pages
[1:07:56] the book may be closed
[1:08:01] night
[1:08:03] and tomorrow will be too late for you to
[1:08:07] do it
[1:08:09] don't put off what you can do today for
[1:08:12] tomorrow for tomorrow may never come
[1:08:16] you see
[1:08:18] another thing that has made Christians
[1:08:20] not be good Christians they always say I
[1:08:22] will do it tomorrow
[1:08:23] I'll pray tomorrow
[1:08:26] I I I will serve God tomorrow
[1:08:29] I will go to church tomorrow
[1:08:32] what if tomorrow does not come he says
[1:08:33] or tomorrow may never work
[1:08:35] tomorrow may never come men and women
[1:08:38] boys and girls may be sitting here
[1:08:40] tonight
[1:08:41] they may be in the MOG before daylight
[1:08:43] oh my God oh my God
[1:08:46] I hope it doesn't happen
[1:08:48] but we say it and it happens sometimes
[1:08:52] we've had stories of people living
[1:08:53] overnight
[1:08:55] and before they reach home they have
[1:08:56] already crossed over where have you gone
[1:08:58] that's the question
[1:08:59] would it be a shame for you to live a
[1:09:01] night service going back at home
[1:09:05] and then you don't arrive home and also
[1:09:07] you don't arrive home
[1:09:11] you understand what I'm talking about
[1:09:14] it would be a shame
[1:09:16] it would rather at least be that you
[1:09:18] don't arrive home but you arrive home
[1:09:20] you don't arrive home but you arrive in
[1:09:21] heaven that's what I'm talking about
[1:09:23] but imagine leaving the church in the
[1:09:25] night
[1:09:26] between now and the morning and then you
[1:09:28] go and you die on the way and you don't
[1:09:31] arrive home in heaven
[1:09:33] it would be a shame that's why it was it
[1:09:35] said it would be a shame for you not to
[1:09:37] hear instructions he said I'll put that
[1:09:39] right tomorrow or the next day or the
[1:09:41] other day friends I think it all to
[1:09:43] bring to us that conclusion in our
[1:09:45] hearts that love for God that desire to
[1:09:48] please God saying oh God I don't want to
[1:09:50] be tomorrow I want it to be today I want
[1:09:53] to live for you today I want to be a
[1:09:55] better Christian today I want to be
[1:09:56] written episode today I want to be you
[1:09:58] know the best I can today not tomorrow
[1:10:01] but today
[1:10:02] you see that's why even in prayer
[1:10:05] services you find people are not praying
[1:10:06] not because they cannot pray sometimes
[1:10:08] people think that you are praying
[1:10:09] because you have too many need someone
[1:10:11] to say oh no they pray so much because
[1:10:14] they have so many needs you think so we
[1:10:16] don't pray because we have so many needs
[1:10:18] praying is having fellowship with God
[1:10:24] have mercy on us listen you cannot have
[1:10:27] fellowship with God if you don't pray if
[1:10:30] you don't pray you cannot have
[1:10:31] fellowship with God even Jesus himself
[1:10:33] to stay in connection and fellowship
[1:10:35] with God he had to pray
[1:10:37] actually Jesus had constant prayer
[1:10:40] constant prayer every day Jesus was
[1:10:42] spending time in prayer you know not
[1:10:45] spending time in prayer is having
[1:10:47] fellowship with God we don't pray for
[1:10:49] what you need but you pray for
[1:10:50] fellowship with God
[1:10:52] to you people who are married do we know
[1:10:54] even sometimes if your connection with
[1:10:57] your wife if your fellowship with your
[1:10:59] wife or your husband is not good
[1:11:01] the home is not at peace you see but if
[1:11:04] you are communicating properly if you're
[1:11:05] talking properly if you are at talking
[1:11:07] levels huh yeah Brothers if you are
[1:11:10] talking whatever sometimes you are not a
[1:11:11] talking level sisters if you're not a
[1:11:13] talking levels with your husband the
[1:11:15] home is going in chaos
[1:11:17] but if you are talking levels and you're
[1:11:19] talking properly everybody's smiling and
[1:11:22] the home is at peace
[1:11:24] the home is at peace in the same way in
[1:11:27] the same way if you're talking with your
[1:11:29] husband properly
[1:11:31] just to know everything has been
[1:11:33] planning for you he will tell you about
[1:11:35] it
[1:11:36] but husbands have or men not naturally
[1:11:39] naturally men keep their Visions in
[1:11:41] their head and they only download them
[1:11:43] to people they can trust and have
[1:11:45] confidence in and when the atmosphere is
[1:11:47] right are you hearing me now the same
[1:11:49] way God you know we're in the we are
[1:11:52] created in the image of God in the same
[1:11:53] way God as our husband God as the
[1:11:56] husband to the church he keeps his
[1:11:58] vision in his mind he has he says I have
[1:12:00] good plans for you he said I have he
[1:12:02] himself I have good plans for you but he
[1:12:05] won't tell you the plans unless you are
[1:12:06] in a talking relationship
[1:12:08] unless you're in Fellowship brother are
[1:12:10] you hearing me brother unless you're in
[1:12:12] a talking relationship you must be in a
[1:12:14] talking relationship with God and what
[1:12:17] is that prayer when you are praying and
[1:12:19] you are communicating back and forth you
[1:12:21] see just like the fellowship we had a
[1:12:23] little bit before we went into the world
[1:12:24] that let me tell you Brethren that
[1:12:27] presence never trade that presence for
[1:12:29] anything never let it live your life
[1:12:31] because if it lives your life you're
[1:12:33] going to be dry if it lives your life if
[1:12:35] you come and pray until you feel the
[1:12:37] presence of God brother run you are in
[1:12:39] danger you're in trouble you are in
[1:12:42] trouble every Christian you should never
[1:12:44] have dry prayers if you have a prayer
[1:12:47] that is dry if you sing songs and you
[1:12:50] you are dry and you pray and you you are
[1:12:53] dry brother sister you are in danger let
[1:12:55] me tell you you are in danger if you die
[1:12:58] I'm not too sure whether you're going to
[1:12:59] heaven because you are not in a talking
[1:13:01] Communication in relationship with God
[1:13:03] you must be connected with the
[1:13:06] supernatural whereby you sing a song and
[1:13:08] you feel like your soul is is just no no
[1:13:11] longer here you are connecting with him
[1:13:13] whereby you are praying and you feel
[1:13:15] like it's no longer you praying it is
[1:13:16] him praying in you interceding for you
[1:13:19] and for other Brethren what is that it
[1:13:21] is you in connection with God
[1:13:24] but what is so sad many believers who
[1:13:26] are called Believers are not talking
[1:13:28] relationship with God they are not they
[1:13:30] are not and and because of that you find
[1:13:33] us having a lot of burdens and needs
[1:13:35] which are not answered
[1:13:36] oh God have mercy on us right you can
[1:13:39] change your prayer life tonight
[1:13:41] you see
[1:13:43] you see if you're not in a talking
[1:13:44] relationship for you to pray you you
[1:13:46] will say Allah let us pray and then at
[1:13:49] at home at the family altar you do it
[1:13:51] because they have said it let us pray
[1:13:54] amen there you go praying for food bless
[1:13:58] it amen you go
[1:14:00] any church
[1:14:02] even our you know prayer night is up to
[1:14:05] midnight so it's not a long time it's
[1:14:07] not a long time even if it was a long
[1:14:09] time you just come and sleep or even if
[1:14:11] it's not a long time you just come
[1:14:12] others are praying and then you're like
[1:14:13] you're following them
[1:14:16] oh man my words are finished I'm no
[1:14:19] longer have what to pray you just sit
[1:14:21] and begin dozing of
[1:14:25] praying what is wrong with you I don't
[1:14:27] have what to pray
[1:14:28] you have a problem let us admit it you
[1:14:31] have a problem
[1:14:33] first of all admit your problem here if
[1:14:35] you don't admit your problem you cannot
[1:14:37] receive a solution you cannot it doesn't
[1:14:40] matter whether you are white black red
[1:14:42] or yellow you must speak in a talking
[1:14:44] relationship with God
[1:14:47] your prayer your relationship with God
[1:14:49] should be not dry it should be wet full
[1:14:52] of his presence full of your tears you
[1:14:55] remember that woman who was on his feet
[1:14:57] you see even at your family out at your
[1:14:59] home you man you woman at your home the
[1:15:03] presence of God should come down oh we
[1:15:05] miss such times
[1:15:06] when you are at the family out and God
[1:15:08] gives Inspirations and God gives
[1:15:10] Revelations and oh my things are coming
[1:15:13] down from above what is that it's God
[1:15:15] people being in a relationship with God
[1:15:18] but what is it happening it is now just
[1:15:20] having a church a connections and the
[1:15:24] church church services church service ah
[1:15:28] we are just doing a prayer for everybody
[1:15:29] and everybody says Ah man now we are
[1:15:31] becoming slowly We are Becoming like the
[1:15:33] Catholics
[1:15:34] the priest is the one who says the
[1:15:35] prayer they don't pray they say prayers
[1:15:39] so I say the prayer and I pray the
[1:15:40] prayer are different things
[1:15:42] I say the prayer is only following words
[1:15:45] which are written somewhere
[1:15:47] Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be
[1:15:51] your name thy kingdom come thy will be
[1:15:53] done on others it is done in heaven amen
[1:15:57] amen and everybody goes home
[1:16:00] you see Believers are now beginning to
[1:16:02] be like Catholics
[1:16:04] we say let us pray if you want to know a
[1:16:07] congregation that is a church which is
[1:16:09] really vibrant a church which is really
[1:16:11] a church
[1:16:13] it is in their prayer life
[1:16:15] you see when you say everybody should go
[1:16:17] in prayer let the musician stop playing
[1:16:19] and hear
[1:16:22] if you hear
[1:16:24] one person amen
[1:16:26] another one yeah
[1:16:29] uh
[1:16:31] brother
[1:16:33] we not only need spiritual thermometer
[1:16:35] but we also need a we need spiritual
[1:16:39] blood transfusion
[1:16:41] we are dying it means we are dying it
[1:16:43] means we are on a blink of death it
[1:16:45] means we are so bad it off Brethren this
[1:16:48] is not a laughing matter this is a
[1:16:50] serious matter it is as serious I'm
[1:16:52] telling you it is a serious matter
[1:16:55] if your prayer life is dying and you
[1:16:57] don't have to let it die you have to
[1:17:00] fight and do everything you can to make
[1:17:02] it bring come back again to life whereby
[1:17:05] when they say let everybody pray don't
[1:17:07] worry some people even can imagine they
[1:17:09] want they don't I don't want my voice to
[1:17:10] be hard can you imagine
[1:17:12] we still have such a a a stupid excuses
[1:17:16] I don't want my voice to be hard I don't
[1:17:18] want to be hard as if I'm the one who
[1:17:20] knows how to pray better than others
[1:17:22] hey you're in prayer and you're fearing
[1:17:25] your voice to be heard so what did you
[1:17:26] come to do
[1:17:27] you were talking to your husband and
[1:17:29] you're fear and your voice to be hard is
[1:17:30] your husband is not anybody's husband
[1:17:32] it's yours if you're talking to him you
[1:17:34] don't care what others say it's your
[1:17:36] husband and you care about how he takes
[1:17:38] you how he receives you how he loves you
[1:17:40] so when you come talk to him you don't
[1:17:42] care what others are saying you lift up
[1:17:44] your voice you will cry out you will
[1:17:46] tear your tears will come down you will
[1:17:48] cry you'll you will shout you'll fall
[1:17:50] you'll do whatever you have to do as
[1:17:51] long as it brings the presence of God to
[1:17:53] you as long as you it can make your
[1:17:56] heart be connected that those moments
[1:17:58] when you are praying and you feel you
[1:18:00] are connected you feel you are seeing
[1:18:02] him you you you you you you feel he's
[1:18:04] hearing you you feel is near you you can
[1:18:06] almost see him by eyes of Faith that's
[1:18:09] what we call a Praying relationship with
[1:18:12] God Brethren let me tell you in that
[1:18:14] kind of prayer even Visions begin to
[1:18:16] burst out many times many many times
[1:18:18] when I'm in such kind of prayers you
[1:18:20] know others are praying and quickly I
[1:18:22] begin to to receive Revelations and
[1:18:24] because others are praying I can't begin
[1:18:25] to prophesy I quickly go pick up my
[1:18:27] paper and the pain and the I have my
[1:18:30] iPad but I cannot use my iPad to do that
[1:18:32] because it is usually fast it comes so
[1:18:34] fast I have to pick a pen and a paper
[1:18:36] and I scribble down those words and I
[1:18:38] write it quickly before that anointing
[1:18:40] leaves why because it is coming through
[1:18:42] prayer it is a connection with the
[1:18:44] supernatural you see that's where
[1:18:46] tongues also come at people you know
[1:18:47] with the gifts of tongues come out
[1:18:49] people with the you know Gifts of you
[1:18:51] know interpretation of tongues and
[1:18:52] prophecies and Revelations the Bible
[1:18:55] says when one person when you all have
[1:18:57] come together one person with the
[1:18:58] Revelation speak out and another one if
[1:19:00] something be revealed to another also
[1:19:03] now he or this one keeps quiet and the
[1:19:05] other one comes out how does that happen
[1:19:06] it happens in prayer some people even
[1:19:09] don't understand these things anymore
[1:19:11] because they don't know what prayer is
[1:19:12] prayer is not saying what prayer is
[1:19:15] connection a deep connection with the
[1:19:17] supernatural prayer is when you come
[1:19:19] before God and you talk to him and you
[1:19:21] you hear him speak back to you and you
[1:19:24] can hear him and he you you can he can
[1:19:26] hear you in other words it is a two-way
[1:19:28] traffic you talk to him and he talks
[1:19:30] back to you so now when you talk to him
[1:19:32] he talks back to you you now pray
[1:19:34] according to what he has told you so
[1:19:36] it's no longer now you speaking brother
[1:19:38] Ivan it is now him speaking through you
[1:19:40] when you begin to talk the first time
[1:19:42] you pray maybe you are speaking your
[1:19:43] words and what you feel and now when he
[1:19:45] speaks to you oh my God you even feel
[1:19:48] excited already amen you feel the fire
[1:19:50] burning on your heart and you begin to
[1:19:52] speak to him back according to what he
[1:19:54] has revealed to you in your soul you see
[1:19:57] but what happens people's hearts for
[1:20:00] prayer and desire for the things of God
[1:20:02] is dwindling down completely dying off
[1:20:05] completely dying of may God give Grace
[1:20:09] but I tell you what we need it it's the
[1:20:11] all-time Revival we need it
[1:20:13] Revival should never die the moment
[1:20:15] Revival dies in a church
[1:20:19] and there cannot be Revival without
[1:20:20] prayer
[1:20:22] there cannot be limited they cannot be
[1:20:23] Revival without prayer time time should
[1:20:25] come
[1:20:26] when we say the service is dismissed and
[1:20:29] people will be here praying until
[1:20:30] morning
[1:20:32] I'm telling you
[1:20:34] time should come if that time doesn't
[1:20:37] come we are not ready for the rapture
[1:20:40] okay you as a younger person who doesn't
[1:20:41] even have a job tomorrow you are rushing
[1:20:44] quickly to go you are the one who came
[1:20:45] in almost at 10 he said okay what time
[1:20:47] is it I don't want to go you know those
[1:20:49] things are still singing and praying let
[1:20:50] me just you're going to hear the one and
[1:20:52] then I go home it is because your prayer
[1:20:54] life has died and you you know yourself
[1:20:55] you're not at peace with God you're not
[1:20:57] very well spiritually speaking
[1:20:59] you must be the one to come and leave
[1:21:01] the fire in prayer in worship as you are
[1:21:04] worshiping God and you are singing that
[1:21:06] song even people who are some leading
[1:21:08] here always be sensitive to the spirit
[1:21:10] of God don't just sing a song and leave
[1:21:12] it and go to another one sing a song to
[1:21:15] get the people into the spirit of
[1:21:17] worship and the spirit of prayer what is
[1:21:19] the worship Worship Is glorifying God
[1:21:21] and God coming down to accept your
[1:21:23] worship it's not just a song it's not
[1:21:26] just a prayer we are not here to say
[1:21:29] prayers we're not here to sing songs we
[1:21:31] are here to worship and we are here to
[1:21:34] fellowship with God In Prayer
[1:21:36] that's what believers do and that's what
[1:21:39] makes the difference that's the
[1:21:40] difference between us and the
[1:21:41] denominations you see that's why many
[1:21:44] message churches no longer have prayer
[1:21:45] night services because it's a thing of
[1:21:48] the past we have the word why do we need
[1:21:50] prayer and you cannot have prayer you
[1:21:53] cannot have fellowship if you don't have
[1:21:54] prayer
[1:21:58] may God help us so that we don't die out
[1:22:01] because he's coming is very soon
[1:22:03] can you put up that court again so I can
[1:22:05] continue a little bit here down
[1:22:08] he says men and boys
[1:22:11] men and women boys and girls may be
[1:22:12] sitting here tonight will be in the MOG
[1:22:14] before daylight it is true
[1:22:17] and then you
[1:22:18] your book is closed
[1:22:20] and you'll never have another chance
[1:22:22] never
[1:22:23] this may be the last chance that you
[1:22:27] will ever have
[1:22:28] think of it seriously
[1:22:31] you say Well it probably isn't it
[1:22:34] probably isn't but it could be
[1:22:36] but remember someday the book is going
[1:22:39] to be crossed
[1:22:41] and what you are doing now you see
[1:22:44] that's why even I appreciate you who are
[1:22:48] standing because you are feeling sleepy
[1:22:50] I believe even
[1:22:53] sleep that comes when you are going to
[1:22:56] pray or when you are hearing the word
[1:22:57] it's demonic sleep
[1:23:00] I'm telling you it's not a real sleep
[1:23:02] it's demonic sleep huh who is that young
[1:23:06] man going out can you come back in here
[1:23:10] listen
[1:23:13] tonight I'm not only spiritually angry I
[1:23:17] believe the holy spirit is telling us
[1:23:18] things here
[1:23:19] what are the deacons doing
[1:23:22] I'm addressing especially him that was
[1:23:26] dozing and the other brother just come
[1:23:28] in let them come in you see when when
[1:23:31] you were when you were praying not only
[1:23:33] here in the church even when you were at
[1:23:35] home and you are praying what happens
[1:23:38] before prayer everybody's Lively
[1:23:41] everybody's jumping up and down
[1:23:44] now when we say it's time for family
[1:23:46] altar then you begin to see those
[1:23:48] sleeping demons coming
[1:23:50] and you automatically feel a lot of
[1:23:52] sleep and heaviness how many have ever
[1:23:54] felt that before
[1:23:56] you see and then after the family altar
[1:24:00] after prayer
[1:24:03] those demons live immediately
[1:24:05] am I correct
[1:24:07] so you can agree with me these demons it
[1:24:10] is sleeping demons the devil uses them
[1:24:12] to take away your desire and your
[1:24:13] strength for prayer
[1:24:15] or for the word the devil knows when is
[1:24:18] the moment the world has been spoken it
[1:24:21] let us now hear the word sleeping demons
[1:24:23] come let us now pray you automatically
[1:24:26] feel happy because it is a demon on you
[1:24:29] and the moment you go in prayer brother
[1:24:31] don't accept that demon to overcome you
[1:24:34] when you are hearing the word don't
[1:24:36] accept that demon to overcome you you
[1:24:37] better stand up in the church you feel
[1:24:39] yourself don't worry you're fighting
[1:24:41] that demon
[1:24:42] if you're going to prayer and we say let
[1:24:44] us now all go to prayer don't say oh now
[1:24:46] me I I am heavy I am tired it is because
[1:24:50] you have a demon on you it is trying to
[1:24:52] tuck you and be happy and put a lot of
[1:24:54] heaviness on you to make you not pray
[1:24:56] fight it until you overcome it how do
[1:24:58] you find it do what it wants you not to
[1:25:00] do
[1:25:01] if that sleeping demon comes on you and
[1:25:03] tells you don't pray then Brother begin
[1:25:06] to pray immediately fight it until you
[1:25:09] overcome it
[1:25:10] when you feel you can't open your mouth
[1:25:13] to pray what you do open your mouth and
[1:25:15] begin to pray amen because if you don't
[1:25:18] do that the moment you don't do at the
[1:25:19] moment you accept the devil will clap
[1:25:21] his hands and the moment the prayer time
[1:25:23] where you will sleep sleep and then
[1:25:25] maybe for one hour he will make sure you
[1:25:27] have slept and slept and then you even
[1:25:29] see Visions false Reasons from him and
[1:25:32] then you wake up after you wake up the
[1:25:34] devil will tell you by the way you have
[1:25:35] finished pray after all you have even
[1:25:36] seen visions
[1:25:37] and now from there you will now go and
[1:25:41] begin watching a video or something and
[1:25:43] you'll be very sober because the demon
[1:25:44] has already overcome you you see and
[1:25:47] your prayer life has gone down and you
[1:25:49] are spiritually low you are spiritually
[1:25:50] dry
[1:25:57] dry there must be something in the
[1:25:59] presence of God the devil knows and
[1:26:01] there's a hindering the people of God to
[1:26:03] come into that presence but let me tell
[1:26:06] you we have found out
[1:26:07] we have discovered him and he has been
[1:26:10] exposed next time we are in prayer
[1:26:13] brother break those demons those are
[1:26:15] religious demons is
[1:26:17] you are hearing the word they are
[1:26:18] bringing you a lot of sleep and when
[1:26:20] after the war then the Sleep goes away
[1:26:22] because it is a spirit on you
[1:26:25] resisted the devil the Bible says and he
[1:26:27] will do what
[1:26:28] he will flee from you Hallelujah
[1:26:32] if the devil tells you you can't hear
[1:26:33] the word your daughter I tell him I will
[1:26:35] hear it and I'm going to stand up
[1:26:38] and I'm going to wash my face and I'm
[1:26:40] going to hear it and the devil I'll tell
[1:26:42] you I'll even say Amen every minute I
[1:26:45] would say amen and I'll make sure I
[1:26:46] don't sleep
[1:26:48] Hallelujah you need to be strategical
[1:26:51] when you are fighting with the devil you
[1:26:52] need to be intentional you don't let you
[1:26:54] don't need to submit to him you need to
[1:26:57] fight him and you need to know your
[1:26:58] enemy you need to know that he that you
[1:27:00] are fighting is also wise he's very
[1:27:03] subtle you need to know him and you need
[1:27:04] to also approach him in that way that's
[1:27:07] why the devil heads these Services of
[1:27:09] overnight and prayer services the devil
[1:27:12] hates prayer time because he knows
[1:27:14] that's the only chance that the people
[1:27:16] of God have time to use this word they
[1:27:19] have in their hands the only time the
[1:27:22] only chance we have is when we can pull
[1:27:24] out our swords of prayer but I'm saying
[1:27:26] this is the weapon the greatest weapon
[1:27:28] that God has ever placed in the hands of
[1:27:30] mankind
[1:27:31] prayer when we wield the sort of prayer
[1:27:34] let me tell you demons disappear in
[1:27:36] prayer so spirits leave you in prayer
[1:27:39] deliverances are God In Prayer power
[1:27:42] comes upon your life in prayer the Holy
[1:27:45] Ghost comes upon you in prayer the Bible
[1:27:48] says they were all together in one
[1:27:49] according they were doing what playing
[1:27:52] cards watching a movie they were praying
[1:27:55] and then the horror goes he came down
[1:27:58] amen like a rushing Mighty Wind and Came
[1:28:01] Upon them
[1:28:02] the devil knows that that's why he will
[1:28:05] make he wants to make our worship dry he
[1:28:07] wants to make our prayer dry he wants to
[1:28:09] make our services so powerless and less
[1:28:12] of power you know whereby our preacher
[1:28:14] just preaches and then we became
[1:28:15] Baptists we just hear
[1:28:17] you know we're just here
[1:28:20] and we just shake our head that's a
[1:28:23] Baptist spirit
[1:28:24] but God has given us the spirit of Jesus
[1:28:27] Christ the spirit of this message to
[1:28:29] overcome those Spirits those religious
[1:28:31] spirits and those demons that come to
[1:28:34] take us out of the presence of God
[1:28:37] you see he even wants to calm down he
[1:28:40] fights preachers let me tell you that's
[1:28:41] why you should pray for your preachers
[1:28:43] pray for them
[1:28:45] pray I'm telling you pray the devil
[1:28:47] tries his best I don't know how many
[1:28:50] times and how many ways the devil's
[1:28:52] fault me that I know there are others I
[1:28:53] don't know of that God didn't tell me
[1:28:55] and yet he overcame for me
[1:28:58] but I'm telling you the ones I know of
[1:29:00] there are countless times I can tell you
[1:29:03] this and this and these are the devil
[1:29:04] used to take me out of the anointing he
[1:29:07] would try his best to capture a preacher
[1:29:09] and put him under his anointing instead
[1:29:11] of God is anointing and the pressure
[1:29:12] will come already a defeated preacher
[1:29:14] you think he's preaching but actually
[1:29:16] when he's under the power of the devil
[1:29:18] and these are the places who will tell
[1:29:20] you don't need to pray you don't need
[1:29:21] the Holy Ghost you just need to sit down
[1:29:22] and hear the word and everything like
[1:29:23] that because they themselves are
[1:29:25] powerless they don't even know the last
[1:29:26] time they went to pray they don't even
[1:29:28] know the last time when they sought God
[1:29:29] the last time when they felt the power
[1:29:30] of the Holy Ghost upon them and the
[1:29:32] devil tries that because he knows yes
[1:29:34] he's trying his best he will come from
[1:29:36] the pulpit all through the congregation
[1:29:38] to try and make us powerless oh church
[1:29:40] let us not be a powerless Church it must
[1:29:43] not be a powerless people you see you
[1:29:45] will try to bring sins there is nothing
[1:29:46] that takes away the spiritual app that
[1:29:48] for prayer like sexual sins
[1:29:51] those sins can make someone so powers
[1:29:55] that don't even have power to say Amen
[1:29:58] in the church
[1:29:59] you see no wonder brother one quote
[1:30:02] somewhere where he says that you see
[1:30:03] when you go and search some of those
[1:30:05] quiet quiet
[1:30:07] congregations of places or churches most
[1:30:10] of the Baptists kind of you know it says
[1:30:12] that they they they they are the Devils
[1:30:17] hang out
[1:30:18] the Devils hang out you see when you see
[1:30:20] those people very quiet like God on
[1:30:22] others dosing on others what nobody can
[1:30:24] shout amen nobody it is a devil's

[1:30:27] if you want a quote you will come I will
[1:30:28] give it to you a Devils the devil's
[1:30:31] hangout why because the devil has
[1:30:33] already overcame all of them the other
[1:30:35] one was in fornication the other one was
[1:30:37] in in this sort of immorality the other
[1:30:39] one was in there the other one was not
[1:30:40] the other so now all of the letter of
[1:30:42] the scripture what they have is the
[1:30:44] quote so we can quote you can read the
[1:30:47] scripture
[1:30:48] and we can quote for you brethren we are
[1:30:51] predestinated
[1:30:52] we are going to heaven
[1:30:54] we are going in the rapture
[1:30:56] even the prophet said this in this court
[1:30:59] and also Apostle Paul said this many
[1:31:03] believe that
[1:31:04] everybody says amen they just behaved so
[1:31:08] well just like you behaved now you kept
[1:31:09] quiet and then they said you can now go
[1:31:11] home

[1:31:55] church and someone is having demons on
[1:31:57] them and they will pull you into their

[1:32:24] the Holy Ghost is here amen has to
[1:32:26] deliver the bound
[1:32:28] and they themselves will begin to say
[1:32:30] amen and certain amen and they will go
[1:32:32] out of here liberated those are the kind
[1:32:34] of services we want but the balam says
[1:32:36] if people can't shout I can't preach if
[1:32:38] people can't shout I can't preach why
[1:32:40] because they are not liberated there is
[1:32:42] spiritual no spiritual you know
[1:32:44] environment for him to do things for him
[1:32:47] to speak
[1:32:48] people can shout oh it brings down the
[1:32:51] presence of God if people can cheer the
[1:32:53] word and accept the one and receive the
[1:32:54] word let me tell you if you're bound by
[1:32:56] something you know by not by being quiet
[1:33:04] God help me I'm feeling yesterday
[1:33:08] Hallelujah
[1:33:10] the spiritual understanding listen if
[1:33:13] you you you you come in the church I'm
[1:33:16] telling you if you come in the church
[1:33:17] and you feel you are so quiet today I'm
[1:33:20] so quiet
[1:33:21] don't let the devil deceive you that
[1:33:23] you're just humble you have a demon on
[1:33:26] you
[1:33:27] charging you
[1:33:29] even say
[1:33:33] amen get it on you and remember what you
[1:33:35] did repent and come before God cry
[1:33:37] before him come early if you can before
[1:33:39] the service begins and pray set yourself
[1:33:41] free so that when the story that comes
[1:33:43] you will not say ah what is happening
[1:33:45] with you today no he himself have prayed
[1:33:47] you have prayed you musicians don't just
[1:33:49] come here with your dirty hands and
[1:33:50] begin playing the instruments if you
[1:33:52] come here come pray it up
[1:33:54] come pray that pray before you come to
[1:33:57] pray the instruments and when you touch
[1:33:59] it you'll be amen you'll be a touch of
[1:34:01] the Holy Ghost and he will come down you
[1:34:03] you cannot go on the instrument before
[1:34:06] praying I'm telling I'm warning you the
[1:34:08] only God knows the instruments before
[1:34:09] praying don't do that have some time at
[1:34:11] least 30 minutes in prayer communicate
[1:34:13] with him have fellowship with God don't
[1:34:16] come on the pulpit before your prayer
[1:34:18] that brother even said you should not
[1:34:19] stand on the pulpit unless you have
[1:34:21] received the Holy Ghost why because what
[1:34:23] you are going to tell us is yourself if
[1:34:25] you don't have the Holy Spirit speaking
[1:34:27] through you you see how much we want the
[1:34:30] Holy Spirit friends
[1:34:31] we want him to come down because any
[1:34:33] time it might be today he said it might
[1:34:36] be you see the chance is gone for you to
[1:34:38] to to change if if he you just
[1:34:42] die before you prepare yourself
[1:34:48] this may be the last chance that you
[1:34:49] will ever have think of it seriously you
[1:34:51] say Well it probably isn't and I said it
[1:34:53] probably isn't but it could be
[1:34:55] but remember somebody
[1:34:57] the book is going to be closed and what
[1:34:59] you are doing now
[1:35:01] and especially you people who are
[1:35:03] claiming to be Christians separate
[1:35:05] yourself from the things of the world
[1:35:07] have nothing to do with the world shut
[1:35:10] it share it
[1:35:12] all those evil conversations
[1:35:15] conversations I'll call them shine it
[1:35:17] don't be a part of them don't be a part
[1:35:20] of those that nonsense you see we left
[1:35:22] the world we can't be back again to eat
[1:35:24] any kind of talk that is not giving God
[1:35:27] glory even if it is from Believers shut
[1:35:28] it you have no part to do with it for
[1:35:31] some person is watching you what you're
[1:35:33] doing somebody's watching you and you
[1:35:35] are going to not only send yourself
[1:35:36] their meaning to hell but you're going
[1:35:38] to take them today to that bad place and
[1:35:41] you are going to have to answer for your
[1:35:43] influence
[1:35:45] how this Prophet watched this young man
[1:35:47] and seeing that God blessed him and how
[1:35:49] what an influence that was how that man
[1:35:51] prospered what God did for him he lived
[1:35:54] a life that was wonderful blessed of God
[1:35:57] and he wouldn't turn right or left now
[1:35:59] here we find another example here in
[1:36:01] this man this man who's here a great
[1:36:04] king who once worked with God the Bible
[1:36:06] said when the king left
[1:36:08] that he was secured well sorry when he
[1:36:10] felt that he was secured he felt that he
[1:36:13] was all right then he was lifted up in
[1:36:16] his heart with the pride May God allow
[1:36:18] with that none of you will be like that
[1:36:21] he now lifted himself up in Pride
[1:36:23] because now I'm secure yeah that first
[1:36:25] he started the spiritual now he became
[1:36:28] Canon
[1:36:29] he said with fire now you are kind of
[1:36:31] where is your fire where did it go you
[1:36:33] think you have arrived
[1:36:36] let me stop here to say this solemnly my
[1:36:38] brother my sister God has made you my
[1:36:40] audience tonight I must be dead honest
[1:36:43] in what I'm saying and you must listen
[1:36:45] to
[1:36:46] you must listen with dead honesty
[1:36:49] that's what the trouble with many people
[1:36:51] today we have some of our ministering
[1:36:54] Brothers some of them gets to a spot
[1:36:56] maybe big Ministries until they feel
[1:36:59] secure and we have a lot of this not
[1:37:01] only independent questions but also in
[1:37:03] the message
[1:37:04] we've had this not this to be true many
[1:37:07] ministers in the land they begin to
[1:37:09] drink some of them even think do you
[1:37:11] know even in the message they begin to
[1:37:13] drink
[1:37:14] when I've Got My Little Kingdom built
[1:37:16] around me there is no reason for me then
[1:37:18] people who love me so much until they
[1:37:20] will never pay attention to or if I do
[1:37:23] this or that or do that let me tell you
[1:37:25] brother there is one who is looking and
[1:37:28] that is God no man is secure the outside
[1:37:30] of God sometimes then we get to a place
[1:37:33] we think God blesses us he give me a
[1:37:36] Cadillac oh he give me a better job oh
[1:37:38] he give me this that's no sign that you
[1:37:40] can't turn his Blessing from you
[1:37:42] when you get lifted up and you feel well
[1:37:45] I was laid all night and prayed I once
[1:37:48] did this and I do that but I don't do it
[1:37:50] anymore you are on a dangerous ground
[1:37:52] see those days when you used to pray
[1:37:55] maybe all night or or you will go out in
[1:37:58] the tickets or somewhere you just go in
[1:38:00] the prince of God let me tell you each
[1:38:02] of you we must have an anger that hunger
[1:38:05] should never leave us the moment that
[1:38:06] hunger to pray leaves you brother you
[1:38:08] want dangerous
[1:38:10] that anger should always be there
[1:38:12] sometimes you just feel to have time
[1:38:14] alone with God
[1:38:16] whereby your time with WhatsApp can wait
[1:38:19] your time with your friends can wait
[1:38:20] your time at work and wait whereby you
[1:38:23] want to have time alone with God it
[1:38:26] doesn't have to be in a church it can be
[1:38:28] somewhere in a bush somewhere it can be
[1:38:30] on a mountain somewhere it can be
[1:38:32] anywhere even in a place in your home
[1:38:34] somewhere you just go and have time in
[1:38:36] prayer
[1:38:38] that hunger that hunger friends should
[1:38:41] not leave us we should not quench it
[1:38:42] with other things
[1:38:51] or something we should not quench to
[1:38:53] those things
[1:38:55] when you get lifted up and you feel well
[1:38:57] I once laid all night and prayed I was
[1:39:00] did this and I do that but I wouldn't do
[1:39:02] it anymore you're on Dangerous Ground
[1:39:06] that's what the matter with our
[1:39:08] Pentecostal people
[1:39:09] while back Yonder either time ago when
[1:39:12] we had little admissions down on the
[1:39:13] corner somewhere and the women with no
[1:39:15] stockings on and beating a tambourine
[1:39:18] down there I had to pray all night and
[1:39:21] everything cops locked you up and stayed
[1:39:23] in jail and so forth you prayed
[1:39:26] the churches all the nominations laughed
[1:39:29] at you and made fun of you but now God
[1:39:31] Has Lifted you up till God some of the
[1:39:33] best
[1:39:35] a great powerful denominations you begin
[1:39:37] to feel secure be careful that's when
[1:39:39] you get lifted up
[1:39:41] then when God sends something you can't
[1:39:43] accept it anymore because you've already
[1:39:45] witnessed this thing then you begin to
[1:39:48] feel secured that's the time that you
[1:39:50] are on your road to your far
[1:39:52] that's for the nominations
[1:39:54] that's for Nations
[1:39:56] may God help us that we don't get there
[1:40:00] that we will be good ambassadors that
[1:40:02] will be prayer warriors a prayer Warrior
[1:40:04] is someone who is always in touch with
[1:40:06] God not someone who shouts so much in
