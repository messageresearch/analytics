[1:36:46] on if you had something on the stove at
[1:36:50] home
[1:36:52] let it
[1:36:53] burn at least for
[1:36:56] today let all your mind your thoughts be
[1:37:00] here be in the service
[1:37:03] 100% is that
[1:37:05] amen amen ah I'm happy to see my
[1:37:08] daughter over
[1:37:11] here
[1:37:13] sister so uh we speaking on pointing
[1:37:15] people to
[1:37:18] Christ pointing people to Christ
[1:37:22] and this is part three of
[1:37:24] that now we have read a scripture where
[1:37:27] Paul was writing to the Corinthians
[1:37:29] telling them be ye followers of
[1:37:35] me many Christians and especially
[1:37:40] preachers or men of God or prophets or
[1:37:44] pastors they read this scripture but
[1:37:46] they end on those
[1:37:48] words be ye followers of me
[1:37:52] who doesn't like a
[1:37:54] following especially in the generation
[1:37:56] in the digital generation that we are in
[1:38:01] now even those that are actually shy and
[1:38:06] are in a maybe in a room somewhere
[1:38:08] closed uh closed
[1:38:12] up they still want to
[1:38:16] following and actually we realize if
[1:38:19] that many people in this generation
[1:38:24] living a shadow a life of a
[1:38:27] shadow and even you who are sited here
[1:38:31] today you are following many
[1:38:34] people that you don't actually have an
[1:38:37] idea of who they
[1:38:39] are when you go on their social media
[1:38:43] handle they speak powerful
[1:38:46] things they post powerful things and you
[1:38:49] begin to convert their life
[1:38:52] but wait until you meet
[1:38:54] them you will realize the whole thing
[1:38:56] was a
[1:38:58] shadow it was not a reality many people
[1:39:02] put up what they really are
[1:39:06] not and you find that the ones that draw
[1:39:10] the bigger follower
[1:39:13] following are the ones who have little
[1:39:16] or nothing to
[1:39:19] offer and so we are in a whereby
[1:39:22] everyone wants a
[1:39:24] following and some have even made it a
[1:39:28] job they they drop out of school they
[1:39:31] they leave the job the work the jobs and
[1:39:35] they go on social
[1:39:37] media to try and get a
[1:39:39] following so that they can pay them
[1:39:42] money and so they will post anything and
[1:39:45] everything that people want to
[1:39:47] watch all the nonsense as long as it
[1:39:51] will attract people towards
[1:39:53] them and you will see people will really
[1:39:57] follow and maybe you are one of those
[1:39:59] that
[1:40:00] follow and and then you know you just
[1:40:02] click follow click follow and when
[1:40:04] someone has a following of of 1K 2K 3
[1:40:08] four four
[1:40:12] 5K you feel that that you are no longer
[1:40:14] down
[1:40:16] here you feel you are now up here and
[1:40:19] that you feel that you are of another
[1:40:22] and and you know on YouTube people have
[1:40:27] channels and and you know they begin
[1:40:29] competing who has a better
[1:40:31] Channel who has a better
[1:40:34] following and of course the more the
[1:40:36] following the more you will be
[1:40:39] paid and so it's a
[1:40:42] generation of people who want to be
[1:40:45] followed and um we notice here Paul says
[1:40:48] be followers of me
[1:40:52] so like I said many preachers
[1:40:55] also they stop there and they want
[1:40:58] people to follow
[1:40:59] them they make sign posts of their
[1:41:03] churches and then put it somewhere where
[1:41:05] it is
[1:41:06] visible and then they put the picture of
[1:41:09] the pastor or the bishop or the
[1:41:11] whatever and they put another one of his
[1:41:14] wife when they like that you know she's
[1:41:18] painted as
[1:41:19] Jezebel and then you know they look so
[1:41:22] presentable and so
[1:41:24] powerful so that they showing you come
[1:41:26] and follow
[1:41:28] us and now when you go to that church
[1:41:31] the testimonies you'll be hearing oh I
[1:41:34] thank God for the man of God the man of
[1:41:36] God has done that for me the man of God
[1:41:38] the man of God the man of God the man of
[1:41:40] God it will be little or less of Christ
[1:41:43] and more of the man of
[1:41:47] God people will be telling you come and
[1:41:49] see our man of God
[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:53] he's anointed he can do
[1:41:55] Miracles you know SS and wonders
[1:41:58] are it's a generation of people
[1:42:00] following
[1:42:01] others and people wanting to be
[1:42:04] followed what is
[1:42:08] Christianity what is
[1:42:10] Christianity Christianity is not
[1:42:12] following
[1:42:14] people Christianity is pointing people
[1:42:17] to Jesus
[1:42:19] Christ chistian is is following
[1:42:23] Christ not even following a
[1:42:26] religion or a set of religious
[1:42:30] beliefs you know come in our church we
[1:42:33] believe a BC d e
[1:42:35] f and and they put a full stop at the
[1:42:39] end everything that is out of what we
[1:42:44] believe is wrong and when they do that
[1:42:48] they form what you call a denomination
[1:42:52] and and and you know they they believe
[1:42:54] that all the other denominations are
[1:42:55] wrong their is the only right
[1:42:59] one that's what the Catholic Church did
[1:43:02] that's what the Anglican Church did
[1:43:04] that's what you know all these you know
[1:43:07] other
[1:43:09] denominations the morons they the
[1:43:11] Jehovah Witness you know you know the
[1:43:14] formed
[1:43:15] religions whereby they have church
[1:43:19] manuals they have you know a set of
[1:43:24] beliefs no more
[1:43:28] Revelation understanding nothing more at
[1:43:32] all whatever is more than what they
[1:43:36] believe even if it is in the
[1:43:39] Bible to them you have gone
[1:43:43] astray and you are wrong and you are
[1:43:46] going to hell and as long as you are not
[1:43:48] a member of their Church
[1:43:51] you are going to hell and what do you
[1:43:54] need to do to to be a member of their
[1:43:57] Church a set of beliefs that they
[1:44:01] believe no matter where it is
[1:44:04] from as long as they believe
[1:44:07] it so you subscribe to it and in some of
[1:44:11] them you even say your name
[1:44:13] somewhere as a sign that you are a
[1:44:16] member they even give you a membership
[1:44:19] card
[1:44:21] as a sign that you are a
[1:44:23] member so it's it's really what is going
[1:44:25] on in the religious world
[1:44:28] today what does the bible teach
[1:44:31] us about true
[1:44:34] Christianity true
[1:44:36] Christianity is not subscribing as a
[1:44:38] member of a circle or a religion or an
[1:44:46] organization true
[1:44:48] Christianity is following Christ
[1:44:52] what is
[1:44:53] Christianity it means to be
[1:44:56] Christlike be like Jesus
[1:44:59] Christ who is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:45:03] is God who came down on Earth and put on
[1:45:08] flesh and was in the likeness of sinful
[1:45:12] flesh and he died on the cross for us so
[1:45:16] that we might become the righteousness
[1:45:18] of
[1:45:19] God
[1:45:21] the Bible says he became
[1:45:23] sin that we might become the
[1:45:25] righteousness of
[1:45:27] God and so now following him believing
[1:45:32] in what he
[1:45:33] told following those who follow
[1:45:37] him is
[1:45:39] Christianity and why are we here today
[1:45:42] we are not here because you're following
[1:45:45] me we are not here because we are saying
[1:45:47] our church is the only right
[1:45:49] Church
[1:45:51] we are not saying that D for days of the
[1:45:53] voice Fellowship is the only
[1:45:56] religion what we are saying is we are
[1:45:59] preaching a living Christ
[1:46:01] here and you can follow
[1:46:04] anybody as long as they following
[1:46:08] Christ and if you're following
[1:46:10] anyone and they not following
[1:46:13] Christ then you are on your way to
[1:46:16] hell we find that all the disciples
[1:46:21] they thought like Paul here said be ye
[1:46:23] followers of
[1:46:25] me even as
[1:46:28] I also am of
[1:46:31] Christ he said that you see these
[1:46:33] teachers that are
[1:46:36] blind meaning those that are not
[1:46:37] following
[1:46:38] Christ he says when the blind follow
[1:46:43] them they all follow into the
[1:46:45] dit they all go to hell but if you
[1:46:49] follow a leader
[1:46:51] if you follow a man make sure he's
[1:46:55] following
[1:46:56] Christ whoever you are following whoever
[1:46:59] you are making your role
[1:47:01] model who is his role
[1:47:05] model Hallelujah if I am your role
[1:47:09] model make sure you find out who is my
[1:47:12] role
[1:47:13] model if my role model is not
[1:47:17] Christ and you follow me you are on your
[1:47:20] way to
[1:47:22] hell but if my role model is
[1:47:25] Christ if I'm following Christ and you
[1:47:28] follow me you are on your way to hell to
[1:47:31] the rure you on your way to heaven as
[1:47:34] long as I'm following
[1:47:36] Christ and you also follow me you are
[1:47:40] sorted
[1:47:40] brother you are sorted sister but the
[1:47:44] problem people are
[1:47:46] blind and they following blind leaders
[1:47:52] if the person you're following on social
[1:47:54] media is not following
[1:47:57] Christ you in a very Sor
[1:48:00] State because whoever you
[1:48:02] following has an
[1:48:06] inspiration if that
[1:48:08] inspiration is not Jesus Christ if it is
[1:48:12] not the
[1:48:13] word then you are in
[1:48:16] geopy you putting your life in
[1:48:19] danger thank God that in this end time
[1:48:23] God has sent us a
[1:48:25] Propet amen William BR never pointed
[1:48:30] people to
[1:48:32] himself he never pointed people to his
[1:48:35] church come on church he pointed people
[1:48:40] to
[1:48:41] the and that's why we are following
[1:48:45] William every true
[1:48:47] Messenger is a star every two messenger
[1:48:51] is a
[1:48:52] star a star can only lead you to a
[1:48:57] destination in the Bible we find when
[1:49:00] Jesus was
[1:49:01] born there was a
[1:49:03] star the North Star and when it appeared
[1:49:08] the Wise Men followed the star if you
[1:49:12] are wise you will follow a
[1:49:15] star amen but the world follows every
[1:49:19] other star
[1:49:21] they have their own stars but the wise
[1:49:24] one will follow the North
[1:49:28] [Music]
[1:49:29] Star it's only one star and whenever it
[1:49:33] appears it is announcing
[1:49:37] something and here we find out that the
[1:49:40] wise men the star and when they were to
[1:49:46] Jerusalem they they realized they start
[1:49:49] disappeared
[1:49:50] and they were
[1:49:51] confused they were confused and they
[1:49:54] realized they needed to get out of this
[1:49:57] place and they find the
[1:49:59] star when they reach the
[1:50:02] palace the star
[1:50:04] disappear the star the true star is not
[1:50:09] going to be found in
[1:50:11] Palace is not going to be found in
[1:50:15] cath the true star is going to be found
[1:50:20] out there in the
[1:50:22] open the true star will not be under a
[1:50:26] denomination under a system TR star
[1:50:30] cannot be bound by organizations of Man
[1:50:34] by religions of man the true star will
[1:50:38] be out there in the
[1:50:40] open out of all
[1:50:43] denominations Leading the People to
[1:50:47] Christ not to one religion to one
[1:50:50] denomination but leading people to Jesus
[1:50:54] Christ and when that star
[1:50:57] appeared they followed it reappeared
[1:51:00] again and the Bible say they were so
[1:51:02] happy they danced they were so happy
[1:51:05] because the star appear That's why we
[1:51:08] should be so happy that we have found
[1:51:10] our
[1:51:11] star in this same time we should be so
[1:51:15] happy we have our
[1:51:17] star hallelujah amen in the Book of
[1:51:21] Revelation chapter one The Bible says
[1:51:25] and there were seven
[1:51:27] stars in the right
[1:51:29] hand amen of Jesus Christ that upon
[1:51:33] the Seven Stars in his right hand what
[1:51:37] are the Seven Stars the Seven Stars Are
[1:51:41] Stars to the seven
[1:51:44] churches what are the seven churches
[1:51:47] Gentile
[1:51:48] dispensation from the days of the
[1:51:52] Apostle up to the end
[1:51:54] time there will be seven
[1:51:57] churches but in each Church
[1:52:00] age there will be one
[1:52:02] star leading
[1:52:05] people to Jesus
[1:52:07] Christ and and then we find out that
[1:52:11] when they followed the
[1:52:13] star they start them to
[1:52:16] Jesus and when they found
[1:52:18] him
[1:52:20] disappear the work of a star
[1:52:23] ends the moment you find
[1:52:27] Christ are you following me the work of
[1:52:30] a St comes to an
[1:52:33] end the moment you find
[1:52:36] Christ there have been seven
[1:52:39] Messengers from Paul Paul was the first
[1:52:41] one you know to to
[1:52:44] Irani and then on on up to
[1:52:48] William Bram is the last star to the
[1:52:52] last Church
[1:52:55] age and when this star
[1:52:57] appear he found people when they are in
[1:53:01] confusion religions and
[1:53:04] denominations and his message was come
[1:53:07] out of her my
[1:53:08] people I have somewhere I am
[1:53:11] taking and someone asked William
[1:53:14] brother he said what should we do should
[1:53:17] we come and gather in Jefferson VI
[1:53:21] should we all come to your
[1:53:23] church he said no he said what about
[1:53:28] Arizona where you started another church
[1:53:31] did we all come there he said no wait it
[1:53:36] has been revealed to me where all of you
[1:53:39] should
[1:53:40] gather there is a place you remember
[1:53:43] there was a place called
[1:53:47] aella I believe it was
[1:53:50] and and that was the
[1:53:52] place where
[1:53:54] everybody of the Old Testament
[1:53:58] Saints had been
[1:54:00] buried how many remember that we talked
[1:54:02] about it one one time here all of them
[1:54:05] were buried in that place and so when
[1:54:08] the resurrection
[1:54:10] happened all of them because they were
[1:54:12] in that
[1:54:13] place they all rose again these are the
[1:54:17] people that the Bible says
[1:54:20] that people saw
[1:54:22] them for 40 days walking on the streets
[1:54:27] of when Jesus Christ died rose again he
[1:54:31] rose with them 40 days they were on
[1:54:36] Earth but they were all bued in one
[1:54:39] place so now people asked a question to
[1:54:42] our
[1:54:43] Prophet should we all
[1:54:45] Gather in your
[1:54:48] church so that
[1:54:50] we be sure of the
[1:54:53] Rapture should we all be have one
[1:54:55] universal denomination where you our
[1:55:00] leader he said
[1:55:02] no but has been revealed to
[1:55:05] me where you should
[1:55:07] gather you want that
[1:55:09] Revelation there is a place where we
[1:55:11] should
[1:55:12] gather there is a place where we
[1:55:15] should it is
[1:55:17] not it is not Jefferson
[1:55:20] it is not America it's not Uganda that
[1:55:24] place is called
[1:55:26] Christ Christ I said Christ is Enough
[1:55:30] For
[1:55:32] Me hallelujah amen we have been given a
[1:55:36] place where we should gather and as long
[1:55:39] as you are there you are going in
[1:55:42] Rapture long as you in that place you
[1:55:45] are going in rure when the trumpet of
[1:55:48] God sounds
[1:55:50] you will be found
[1:55:52] ready for the
[1:55:54] Rapture that's the place where we should
[1:55:57] go and for the first time in the end
[1:56:01] time we had one
[1:56:03] man a star who came and pointed us to
[1:56:08] [Music]
[1:56:09] Christ he never did point us to our
[1:56:13] denomination that is why this message is
[1:56:16] not a
[1:56:18] denomination can be
[1:56:20] denominated Hallelujah people come and
[1:56:23] they ask
[1:56:24] us so where where where where else are

[2:11:13] faith our faith is built upon Jesus
[2:11:17] Christ
[2:11:19] not on any man our faith is buil upon
[2:11:23] the
[2:11:24] author is built upon the
[2:11:30] Finish glory to
[2:11:32] God that's why we point people to
[2:11:37] Christ and any man or woman who is not
[2:11:41] in this
[2:11:43] message and he's telling you he's
[2:11:46] pointing people to Christ is a
[2:11:51] liar why is he a
[2:11:55] liar is's pointing
[2:11:57] people to his
[2:12:00] organization to
[2:12:04] himself to his
[2:12:06] religion and that's why one one big
[2:12:12] Mega this is the truth women should not
[2:12:16] wear
[2:12:17] trousers
[2:12:18] they should not
[2:12:20] preach they should even use
[2:12:24] makeup baptism in the
[2:12:27] of it's the truth but if you preach this
[2:12:31] you become
[2:12:34] poor so they don't preach it they look
[2:12:38] at people like
[2:12:39] us they say you are
[2:12:43] losers but wait a moment time is coming
[2:12:47] when they know who will be the
[2:12:50] loser I will preach this even if I
[2:12:54] remain poor I will preach this even if I
[2:12:57] have only 100 people for 10 I will pre
[2:13:00] this even if No One Believes I will pre
[2:13:04] the
[2:13:05] word hallelujah and we know they are
[2:13:10] following other men who are leading them
[2:13:14] to
[2:13:15] themselves the Bible says they have
[2:13:17] itching ears
[2:13:20] you know these preachers they come to
[2:13:23] scratch their
[2:13:25] ears you know let me scratch

[2:13:38] hear he told you sister Dr the way you
[2:13:42] feel
[2:13:45] like I had recently another one saying

[2:13:49] Christian but if God bless
[2:13:52] you with your body Let It Be SE show the
[2:13:57] glory of
[2:14:00] God these are the same men who use these
[2:14:04] women they areful
[2:14:08] themselves and they are calling
[2:14:09] themselves
[2:14:10] preachers thank God for this
[2:14:13] message because the message has taken us
[2:14:16] out of confusion
[2:14:19] we are in a place of
[2:14:22] understanding we know what we are
[2:14:24] talking
[2:14:25] about don't come here and you find 100
[2:14:29] people and you think we are a younger
[2:14:32] child we are a mature child we know what
[2:14:35] we are talking about we are leading
[2:14:37] people to
[2:14:38] heaven we know the word this is what we
[2:14:42] are pointing people
[2:14:45] to
[2:14:46] praise
[2:14:48] if you don't like it you in the wrong
[2:14:50] place you might as well live right
[2:14:54] now but I'm glad I'm preaching to people
[2:14:57] who love
[2:15:00] it
[2:15:03] Hallelujah the devil must be shaking
[2:15:05] whatever he
[2:15:08] is hallelujah hallelujah in the message
[2:15:11] Be not
[2:15:12] Afraid amen the prophet says and
[2:15:15] mothers just take more time
[2:15:19] talk to their children about God and
[2:15:21] pray for
[2:15:26] them we would have less juvenile
[2:15:31] delinquency first of all it is parent
[2:15:36] delinquency before we have juvenile
[2:15:40] delen when you have when you see a
[2:15:42] generation of spoiled people young
[2:15:45] people it means the parents themselves
[2:15:47] of the
[2:15:50] SP if you see a generation of prayerless
[2:15:53] young
[2:15:54] people it means the parents are
[2:15:58] prayerless you look at how they
[2:16:00] dress and when you look at their mothers
[2:16:03] you will not be surprised it is coming
[2:16:06] from
[2:16:07] somewhere that's why you young
[2:16:10] men women of
[2:16:13] virt gods are
[2:16:15] virtuous who know how to dress
[2:16:19] coveries who dress as
[2:16:22] Saints because we are
[2:16:24] Saints we are Heaven bound but if you
[2:16:27] don't do that you get a
[2:16:30] generation of
[2:16:33] delence if mothers would take their
[2:16:36] place in the
[2:16:38] house and the
[2:16:40] Bible and pray for their
[2:16:43] children and lead them to
[2:16:46] Christ that's your
[2:16:49] job your job is not in a job
[2:16:52] somewhere in a public place
[2:16:55] somewhere no it is all
[2:16:58] right I did not say it is
[2:17:01] wrong for women to
[2:17:03] work I said you are God given
[2:17:08] role is to take care of your
[2:17:10] children is to teach them the ways of
[2:17:13] God but because the women have abandoned
[2:17:17] their
[2:17:19] the family is are
[2:17:23] broken M even if you're
[2:17:25] working find time for your
[2:17:28] children teach them instruct them pray
[2:17:33] for them lead them to Christ we have
[2:17:37] homes without a
[2:17:40] backone when a man in the house cannot
[2:17:44] pray cannot call a family altar
[2:17:49] if you are here and you are listening to
[2:17:50] me and you are a man in your house and
[2:17:54] you can't call your wife and your
[2:17:55] children together for a
[2:17:58] family you are a man without
[2:18:01] a because you are leading a
[2:18:04] home pointing them to yourself and not
[2:18:07] to
[2:18:08] CHR we should Point our
[2:18:11] home our family to
[2:18:13] Christ even you husbands Point your
[2:18:16] wives to Christ
[2:18:19] don't show them I'm your lord I tell you
[2:18:22] what to do you
[2:18:23] do lead them to the
[2:18:26] world teach them the ways of
[2:18:29] God become yourself as if you a God in
[2:18:31] your
[2:18:33] home you are not a God in your home God
[2:18:36] is a God in
[2:18:38] your that's why marriage is not marriage
[2:18:40] without
[2:18:43] God three God wife husband
[2:18:49] but fathers have abandoned their
[2:18:53] duties they have left their god-given
[2:18:56] Ro you should be able to lead your
[2:18:59] wife and teach her the way of
[2:19:02] God take care of her and and and pray
[2:19:06] for her pray with her if you don't do
[2:19:09] that she won't do it for the
[2:19:12] children it comes from up Christ did it
[2:19:16] for us so the men can do it for their
[2:19:19] wiv and the can do it for the
[2:19:24] children praise God I'm sorry if you
[2:19:27] think this is hard
[2:19:30] preaching I'm so sorry I I don't know
[2:19:34] how to preach
[2:19:37] better you
[2:19:39] see pray for them and lead them to
[2:19:43] Christ instead of going out to some
[2:19:46] stitch stitch and so party and play
[2:19:51] cards and drink and Carry On
[2:19:57] Smoke praise God in the message oness
[2:20:02] not only that but the Oneness between
[2:20:05] husband and wife was
[2:20:08] broken I don't believe there is any
[2:20:10] marriage can be what it ought to be
[2:20:13] without a union between husband and wife
[2:20:16] and God
[2:20:23] if you are believers please say
[2:20:25] Amen because even if you don't say Amen
[2:20:28] I'm preaching it
[2:20:30] any he says I don't believe any marriage
[2:20:32] can stand without that relationship
[2:20:35] Union between husband and wife and
[2:20:43] God they will bring up
[2:20:46] children in the
[2:20:48] world and make them illegitimates
[2:20:52] give them
[2:20:54] cigarettes give them Whiskey play cards
[2:20:58] in their
[2:21:01] s drink liquor before
[2:21:04] them no matter how loyal they are to
[2:21:07] their marriage
[2:21:10] vows that is just sexually that's
[2:21:13] flesh they are loyal there like that
[2:21:17] but there is a spirit in
[2:21:20] there that Spirit of a sinner Papa and
[2:21:25] Mama no matter how loyal to their
[2:21:29] children it will come
[2:21:33] wrong when you say I know men and women
[2:21:37] that didn't teach their children that
[2:21:38] and wasn't
[2:21:43] Christian the very thing of not leading
[2:21:46] them to Christ
[2:21:50] they may have raised their children
[2:21:52] well but without leading them to
[2:21:54] Christ the very thing of not leading
[2:21:59] them to
[2:22:00] Christ was the wrongest thing they could
[2:22:04] ever do
[2:22:06] [Music]
[2:22:07] besides they may not it is wrong to to
[2:22:10] drink before
[2:22:13] them it is wrong to to smoke and to play
[2:22:16] cards before
[2:22:19] but it is
[2:22:23] wronger to not bring them to
[2:22:26] Christ you must lead them to
[2:22:30] Christ come on Papa and Mama hearing me
[2:22:32] to you must lead your children to
[2:22:36] Christ you can't have a correct Union
[2:22:38] without
[2:22:41] it while you are
[2:22:43] beginning make a resolution I am an army
[2:22:47] of the Lord I am going to fight for my
[2:22:50] children I'm going to lead them to
[2:22:52] Christ I am going to show them Christ
[2:22:55] I'm going to pray with them I'm going to
[2:22:58] fight until I win this
[2:23:02] batt if you don't do that you can't have
[2:23:06] a correct
[2:23:07] Union the fellowship is
[2:23:10] broken then as soon as the fellowship
[2:23:12] was broken between Adam and
[2:23:15] Eve as soon as Fellowship was broke
[2:23:18] between God and
[2:23:21] them then their Fellowship between each
[2:23:23] other
[2:23:26] was first it was the relationship
[2:23:28] between Adam Eve and
[2:23:31] God as long as that was
[2:23:34] intact their family was
[2:23:36] in but when that broke see what became
[2:23:40] of the
[2:23:42] family friends some of you I understand
[2:23:46] you may come from broken home
[2:23:52] but what I'm saying here is that leave
[2:23:54] the
[2:23:55] past begin a new
[2:23:58] generation it begins with
[2:24:00] you some of you it begins with your
[2:24:04] children say they will serve the
[2:24:07] Lord no membership but Fellowship
[2:24:10] we appointing people to
[2:24:13] Christ not to our
[2:24:15] church not to who
[2:24:18] yeah not my husband my
[2:24:21] wife we are pointing people to
[2:24:25] Christ and you people that's this is
[2:24:28] identified with Christ and you people
[2:24:30] that's around here in the
[2:24:32] city or neighboring
[2:24:34] around that doesn't have a home yet a
[2:24:36] church
[2:24:38] home you're welcome here this is what a
[2:24:41] prophet said in his own
[2:24:43] church come any
[2:24:45] time make this your
[2:24:48] home
[2:24:51] remember so when he says that he says
[2:24:55] remember we don't have no membership
[2:24:59] here just Fellowship for
[2:25:02] all everybody say Fellowship for
[2:25:05] all welcome everybody and
[2:25:09] anybody some people they say I fear to
[2:25:12] go to your church because your church
[2:25:13] dresses so
[2:25:15] well
[2:25:17] everybody there looks so
[2:25:20] holy ah the very reason they have that
[2:25:24] attitude is because you g them that
[2:25:29] attitude don't give people that
[2:25:32] attitude that you are the best Church in
[2:25:34] the
[2:25:35] world you are the lowest Church in the
[2:25:38] world because without Christ what are
[2:25:42] you so Point people to
[2:25:44] Christ not to how good your church is
[2:25:48] I've seen people who
[2:25:50] say we here are going to heaven and
[2:25:54] everybody here going to heaven and
[2:25:56] everybody who is around here and does
[2:25:59] not come here he going to hell what an
[2:26:04] attitude some people have keys for
[2:26:07] heaven no one has keys for
[2:26:09] heaven that you will lock out someone
[2:26:11] and lock lock yourself
[2:26:14] in some people will come and say please
[2:26:16] open for me
[2:26:18] go you ref to
[2:26:24] of Heaven Is Not
[2:26:27] That Heaven is for
[2:26:30] all that in
[2:26:34] Christ in
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:38] Christ and we know who
[2:26:45] Christ you may be a preacher for years
[2:26:50] but if what you preach is not in the
[2:26:52] word you are not leading people to
[2:26:55] Christ but to
[2:26:58] yourself so remember we don't have
[2:27:00] Fellow
[2:27:03] membership we don't have as as Howard
[2:27:06] say used to
[2:27:09] say no but
[2:27:12] love your
[2:27:15] neighbor no Creed but
[2:27:19] Christ I love this I'm this no Creed but
[2:27:24] Christ come on tell your neighbor not
[2:27:26] but
[2:27:27] Christ you can preach with me for a few
[2:27:29] moments now there no book but the
[2:27:33] Bible
[2:27:35] Hallelujah and so you are always
[2:27:39] welcome this little Tabernacle he
[2:27:41] say which we are expecting if the Lord
[2:27:43] willing
[2:27:45] soon we can to build a better
[2:27:51] church I believe even here at DF we
[2:27:53] shall build a better
[2:27:55] church he says I'm more substantial
[2:27:59] place you see if you have the
[2:28:02] truth you believe to have the
[2:28:07] best not some
[2:28:10] some we are children of the king and we
[2:28:14] expect to have the
[2:28:15] best so we should have Vision we should
[2:28:19] be men and women of
[2:28:21] vision all right a few more moments now
[2:28:24] here 1 Corinthians 12
[2:28:27] 12 for the body is one and has me and
[2:28:29] has many members and all the members of
[2:28:31] the of that one body being many are one
[2:28:33] body so also is Christ for by one Spirit
[2:28:36] are we all baptized into one body
[2:28:37] whether we be Jews or Gentile whether we
[2:28:39] be born of free and have been all me to
[2:28:41] drink into one
[2:28:45] spirit
[2:29:09] so we have all been made to drink of one
[2:29:12] Spirit there is only one body how do we
[2:29:15] become part of the body
[2:29:19] by being born
[2:29:20] again don't join it we born into
[2:29:25] it by being filled with the Holy Spirit
[2:29:28] and if you're not filled with the Holy
[2:29:30] Spirit I don't it doesn't matter how
[2:29:32] much you are loved in the
[2:29:34] church how much you do for God you're
[2:29:37] not going to the
[2:29:38] rupture you're not a part of that
[2:29:41] body you don't join that body by being
[2:29:43] baptized in
[2:29:45] water that's what the church does to
[2:29:49] have fellowship with
[2:29:50] you but for you to be a part of the body
[2:29:53] of
[2:29:53] Christ you must be born
[2:29:57] again by the Holy Spirit Hallelujah
[2:30:01] where the spirit of God comes in your
[2:30:04] soul and he burns all the world
[2:30:08] out are you hearing me he burns all the
[2:30:11] world
[2:30:13] out he burns all the lust of the world
[2:30:16] of
[2:30:18] life and all the lust of the
[2:30:21] eyes gives you his spirit gives you his
[2:30:25] life that's what makes you a member of
[2:30:28] the
[2:30:30] body and if you filled with the Holy
[2:30:33] Ghost you are part of the
[2:30:36] body and there are many almost
[2:30:39] everywhere they are not only in this
[2:30:41] Fellowship there many fellowships all
[2:30:43] over the
[2:30:45] world long as they are filled with the
[2:30:47] Holy
[2:30:48] Ghost they are my brother they are my
[2:30:53] sister and if you're filled with with
[2:30:55] the Holy
[2:30:57] Spirit you will have
[2:30:59] love for your brother and for your
[2:31:02] sister no matter how they wrong you no
[2:31:05] matter how much they do bad to
[2:31:07] you you know you will have love because
[2:31:11] that love I'm talking about is the love
[2:31:12] of
[2:31:13] God it does not fail it is permanent say
[2:31:18] Amen if you believe
[2:31:19] that God has no
[2:31:22] grandchildren he only has Sons and
[2:31:24] Daughters children who are usually born
[2:31:27] by
[2:31:31] experience 1 Corinthians 12:14 for the
[2:31:35] body is not one member but
[2:31:38] many if the food shall say because I am
[2:31:41] not the hand I am not the body is it
[2:31:43] there for not of the
[2:31:45] body
[2:31:48] and if the ear shall say because I am
[2:31:50] not the eye am not of the body is it
[2:31:52] there not of the
[2:31:56] body if the whole body were an
[2:32:00] eye where were the
[2:32:02] hearing the whole were
[2:32:06] hearing where were they
[2:32:08] smelling but now has God set the members
[2:32:11] every one of them in the body as it has
[2:32:12] pleased
[2:32:15] him
[2:32:17] and if they were all one one member
[2:32:19] where were the
[2:32:22] body but now are the many but now are
[2:32:25] there many
[2:32:27] members yet but one
[2:32:30] body that's why I said we have very many
[2:32:36] Fellowship you see but
[2:32:40] the each of us are different
[2:32:43] members you cannot say why don't you
[2:32:45] bring all the message churches
[2:32:50] brother and make a
[2:32:53] cathedral and you make brother Dixon
[2:32:55] your
[2:32:57] pastor no we don't function that
[2:33:02] way our headquarters in
[2:33:05] heaven and down here on Earth we are
[2:33:08] different
[2:33:09] members out of the same
[2:33:12] body you cannot begin to say our church
[2:33:15] is the best
[2:33:18] that means you have not been raised
[2:33:20] properly you don't know what it is it's
[2:33:23] not about your
[2:33:25] fellow just a little
[2:33:29] in and every member is
[2:33:32] important every Fellowship is
[2:33:35] important just like in the church you
[2:33:38] know the church has many different
[2:33:42] members everybody is
[2:33:44] important tell your nebor you are
[2:33:47] important say for us for us we don't
[2:33:50] have a
[2:33:52] car at least those ones are on another
[2:33:55] class those ones are better than us you
[2:33:58] don't know what you're talking
[2:33:59] about whether you drive or you don't
[2:34:02] drive whether you have a motorcycle or
[2:34:04] you don't whether you have a bicycle or
[2:34:06] you don't God takes each of us as
[2:34:10] individuals and he begins to mold a
[2:34:12] character within
[2:34:14] us when your has been
[2:34:17] molded to a level where God now can
[2:34:20] trust you with a
[2:34:24] car he will give you a
[2:34:26] car actually God is willing to give you
[2:34:28] a car like
[2:34:30] yesterday but the problem is you are not
[2:34:34] growing you are in the same same
[2:34:38] place you look at others and you C them
[2:34:42] you look at others and you look down on
[2:34:45] yourself
[2:34:47] that's why you are the way you are now
[2:34:50] I'm giving you a secret to come out of
[2:34:52] that place begin saying positive things
[2:34:54] about
[2:34:55] yourself I am rich I I I am better than
[2:34:59] this I am driving I am I am I am I am
[2:35:04] you confess it it will happen to you

[2:39:56] Andrew has a reason
[2:39:58] for but you are
[2:40:00] there you fearing
[2:40:02] responsibility and you want good things
[2:40:04] from from the Father the father will
[2:40:07] give it to those that deserve
[2:40:09] it he's a righteous
[2:40:12] judge and whatever you need chge you
[2:40:15] have to learn to believe for
[2:40:17] it you have to learn to prophesy it into
[2:40:22] existence and then don't be
[2:40:24] L begin working by faith beli for big
[2:40:29] things if you say believe it say
[2:40:32] Amen so everyone in the church is
[2:40:36] important you are important you may be a
[2:40:40] stripper you are important you may have
[2:40:42] nothing you are
[2:40:43] important because if the the little
[2:40:46] finger
[2:40:48] said because I'm not a thumb I am not
[2:40:51] part of the body he is just
[2:40:54] joking because you are
[2:40:58] needed the whole body is need every
[2:41:01] every part of the
[2:41:03] body every one of us is important
[2:41:08] valuable here we are not in a
[2:41:10] denomination where someone
[2:41:14] brings one milli
[2:41:18] and then the
[2:41:19] pastor
[2:41:22] fire the powerful
[2:41:24] blessing God shake
[2:41:28] heaven and then my brother
[2:41:33] brings God bless
[2:41:36] you here we believe every one of us is
[2:41:41] an important part of the
[2:41:44] body be faithful to God the little you
[2:41:48] have and the big you have and notice God
[2:41:53] will take you from glory to glory to
[2:41:55] glory to glory
[2:41:58] glory we are all a part of one
[2:42:02] another and we all need one
[2:42:05] another no one is more important than
[2:42:07] the
[2:42:08] other you may just be coming to church
[2:42:11] and sit
[2:42:12] down you are important you you may never
[2:42:16] do anything in the
[2:42:17] church that's your presence that makes
[2:42:21] you
[2:42:24] important I hope that nobody in this
[2:42:26] Fellowship ever feels little or
[2:42:28] ridiculed or look down
[2:42:33] on every one of us should walk as a son
[2:42:37] of Hallelujah Hallelujah and that's why
[2:42:41] there should be no competition in the
[2:42:44] body
[2:42:46] competion the ey cannot say unto the
[2:42:49] hand I have
[2:42:52] no again the head to the feet I don't
[2:42:55] need you I have no need of
[2:42:58] you much more those members of the body
[2:43:01] which seem to be more Fe
[2:43:04] [Music]
[2:43:06] unnecessary tell your neighbor you
[2:43:10] necessary and those members of the body
[2:43:12] which which we think to be less
[2:43:14] honorable
[2:43:17] upon this we best more abundant
[2:43:21] H and our UNC Parts have more abundant
[2:43:24] cess our uncomely parts have more
[2:43:27] abundant
[2:43:32] C our parts have no
[2:43:36] need but God has tempered the body
[2:43:44] together having given more abundant
[2:43:46] honor to that part which
[2:43:53] lacked which
[2:43:56] lacked yes that there should be noism in
[2:43:59] the
[2:44:02] body but that the members should have
[2:44:04] the same care one for
[2:44:06] [Music]
[2:44:08] another and whether one member suffer
[2:44:11] all the members
[2:44:14] suffer
[2:44:16] someone rise up says you know what I'm
[2:44:19] doing a wedding support me
[2:44:21] help and
[2:44:24] like it's not my
[2:44:28] wedding hey you don't know what we are
[2:44:32] we are a body when something happens
[2:44:35] here and happens in another
[2:44:37] church we together even if it's a
[2:44:41] convention if invited to a convention
[2:44:44] maybe maybe which is being organized by
[2:44:46] evening
[2:44:49] light church we are
[2:44:52] members of that church as
[2:44:55] well we are members in the fellowship
[2:44:57] here members of the bigger
[2:45:00] church when you go there let me leave
[2:45:04] these people to
[2:45:08] suffer you don't know what you're
[2:45:10] talking
[2:45:13] about we are members
[2:45:16] of one
[2:45:17] body when one
[2:45:20] M all of
[2:45:22] us one member will be
[2:45:24] honored all members Rejoice
[2:45:28] with hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[2:45:31] name of the
[2:45:32] Lord I'm trying to find a place now to
[2:45:35] bring it to a
[2:45:37] close one body different
[2:45:40] gifts but they all poined to
[2:45:43] Christ but if he has a gift of God and
[2:45:46] he's trying to edify the body of Christ
[2:45:47] then I don't care what what he belongs
[2:45:54] to you are not Discerning the man you
[2:45:57] are Discerning the spirit the life
[2:45:58] that's in the
[2:46:01] [Music]
[2:46:03] man are you hearing me amen don't now be
[2:46:06] quiet on me yet and that's what God told
[2:46:09] us to
[2:46:10] do not one time was ever commissioned to
[2:46:13] design the man's group
[2:46:18] but we was constrained and commanded by
[2:46:19] God to design the spirit in the
[2:46:24] mind what he's trying to do what the
[2:46:28] spit in his life is trying
[2:46:31] to and then if we can find out that he's
[2:46:34] trying to lead the people not to break
[2:46:36] them up to bring them
[2:46:41] together and to bring the Church of the
[2:46:43] Living God not all to one
[2:46:48] denomination to
[2:46:52] understanding a
[2:46:54] fellowship a Unity of
[2:46:56] spirit then if he's a former Reign or
[2:46:59] lat Reign or whatever he
[2:47:01] is days of the voice fellow of
[2:47:07] the what his name is whatever it is his
[2:47:12] spirit and his purpose is is
[2:47:17] right and the spirit that's in him no
[2:47:20] matter what move he belongs
[2:47:26] to the spirit that's in him is trying to
[2:47:28] point the people to
[2:47:33] Calvary away from
[2:47:35] himself away from anything
[2:47:38] else but his only achievement he has is
[2:47:41] to point them to
[2:47:43] Calvary he doesn't care whether he's
[2:47:46] even known or
[2:47:48] not listen Church days of the voice
[2:47:52] Fellowship listen to me now that is why
[2:47:55] we do not believe in this press play
[2:48:02] movement why because they're pointing us
[2:48:05] to
[2:48:09] William they making a
[2:48:12] denomination pointing us to one man
[2:48:16] but what did William Bram
[2:48:18] do or
[2:48:20] preacher he pointed people to
[2:48:24] Christ and that's why we don't follow
[2:48:27] any
[2:48:28] move we don't attend any Fellowship that
[2:48:32] points us to a
[2:48:34] man to a man but we are followings such
[2:48:40] like Paul said follow me as I follow
[2:48:44] Christ
[2:48:46] in other words if anybody's pointing you
[2:48:49] to
[2:48:50] him follow
[2:48:53] him because he's pointing you to
[2:48:55] Christ but if he's pointing you to
[2:48:58] himself run away as hard as you
[2:49:01] can it doesn't matter what his name the
[2:49:04] name of his church
[2:49:05] is whether in the message or out of the
[2:49:08] message as long as he's pointing to
[2:49:11] himself his system run
[2:49:15] and I'm going to finish with this story
[2:49:17] in second Samuel everybody turn to
[2:49:20] second Samuel
[2:49:23] 15 praise the name of the
[2:49:26] Lord 15
[2:49:33] verse and it came to pass after 40 years
[2:49:35] that absolom said unto the king I pray
[2:49:38] thee let me go and pay my vow which I
[2:49:40] have vowed unto the Lord in in Hebron
[2:49:43] for thy servant Ved a V while I at
[2:49:46] gesu in Syria saying if the Lord shall
[2:49:49] bring me again indeed to Jerusalem then
[2:49:51] I will serve the Lord and the King said
[2:49:53] unto him go in peace so he arose and
[2:49:56] went to hibron but absolum sent spies
[2:49:59] throughout all the tribes of Israel
[2:50:01] saying as soon as you hear the sound of
[2:50:02] the trumpet then ye shall say absolum
[2:50:05] reth in heon and with Absalom went 200
[2:50:09] men out of Jerusalem that were called
[2:50:12] and they went in their Simplicity and
[2:50:14] they knew not anything and absum sent
[2:50:16] for AEL gilonite David's counselor from
[2:50:20] his City even from gilo while he offered
[2:50:23] sacrifices and the conspiracy was strong
[2:50:25] for the people increased continually
[2:50:27] with absolum and there came a messenger
[2:50:29] to David saying the hearts of the men of
[2:50:31] Israel are after Absalom now I want you
[2:50:34] to follow this story
[2:50:35] here last time we talked about a little
[2:50:37] bit about
[2:50:38] Absalom AB was the son of the
[2:50:42] king but you see ABS designed to make
[2:50:45] himself the
[2:50:47] King instead of his father and we see
[2:50:51] here that at first he was standing by
[2:50:53] the
[2:50:55] gate you know speaking to the people and
[2:50:58] speaking about himself and what he can
[2:51:00] do for
[2:51:01] [Music]
[2:51:03] them and people began he began to steal
[2:51:06] people's
[2:51:07] hearts and now we see here and we have a
[2:51:10] lot of preachers like
[2:51:12] that and I gave you an example of one
[2:51:14] preacher
[2:51:16] the student said wherever I stand
[2:51:20] miracles happen I'm telling you God
[2:51:23] anointed me God empowered me I'm a
[2:51:26] powerful man and when whenever I stand
[2:51:30] back the heal the sick are healed the
[2:51:33] eyes of the blind are open the dead are
[2:51:36] raised and to die it's going to be fire
[2:51:40] and that was the beginning the opening
[2:51:43] statements so everybody was ready
[2:51:47] for and by the time he finished
[2:51:50] preaching he wanted the pulpit to
[2:51:52] swallow
[2:51:55] him he went away very
[2:51:58] humble how I wish he had come to the
[2:52:03] pit it's not about what you have you are
[2:52:07] nothing there's no healer God is the
[2:52:11] Healer there's no savior God is the saor
[2:52:15] and so as a minister you a servant I am
[2:52:18] a
[2:52:19] servant and I have nothing God does not
[2:52:22] use me I have nothing of myself and so
[2:52:28] ABS made himself so
[2:52:33] high I don't know
[2:52:35] why people want
[2:52:37] people themselves it's as if like girls
[2:52:42] want to get married
[2:52:45] you see a young man talking about
[2:52:48] himself and you also taken
[2:52:51] up
[2:52:54] me me I am on free land what do you want
[2:52:59] tell me what you want speak speak the
[2:53:03] word me me in this
[2:53:06] nation I shake this I shake this some
[2:53:11] people
[2:53:13] say

[2:53:17] minutes you don't even know how I have
[2:53:19] done it me I have
[2:53:22] authority look at somebody talking about
[2:53:26] themselves and then somebody's heart is
[2:53:28] taken up you really have something wrong
[2:53:31] with you let me tell you people who
[2:53:34] speak about
[2:53:36] themselves they
[2:53:38] are
[2:53:41] they they empty anty
[2:53:45] makes a lot of
[2:53:49] noise many times when people talk about
[2:53:51] who they are everything they speak are
[2:53:55] lies rich people don't advertise
[2:53:59] themselves I don't need to come and say
[2:54:02] that I'm
[2:54:03] rich I look
[2:54:07] poor know bread is
[2:54:13] there is the one who did
[2:54:16] that when somebody drives high class you
[2:54:20] don't need to

[2:55:02] your head a rich person they don't need
[2:55:05] to show off they even hide their key and
[2:55:10] when you you humble

[2:58:55] times after the wedding before anyone
[2:59:00] told she had also received the
[2:59:06] reation
[2:59:08] so that was
[2:59:10] free
[2:59:12] now servant V now I want to I want to
[2:59:17] finish my sermon
[2:59:19] today
[2:59:21] ABS there a speed I want to hammer on
[2:59:25] him here is
[2:59:27] ABS he comes to the king and tells
[2:59:31] him now you know
[2:59:37] your while I was still in in
[2:59:41] syri saying if the Lord will bring me
[2:59:44] again here to
[2:59:47] Jerusalem then I will serve the
[2:59:50] Lord and so the king said
[2:59:53] him oh you want to go to
[2:59:59] toon I don't know which place did you
[3:00:01] want to go
[3:00:02] to is it
[3:00:04] Syria wait absam said unto the king I
[3:00:07] pray let me go and pay my V which I
[3:00:09] vowed unto the Lord in Hebron yes in
[3:00:11] heon so let me go to he
[3:00:14] because I vow
[3:00:16] a that if God will bring me
[3:00:19] again to Jerusalem then I
[3:00:22] Ser I have
[3:00:24] a in my heart to do something for the
[3:00:29] Lord please let me
[3:00:31] go the king told him go
[3:00:36] inace but was was it
[3:00:40] true was it what was in his heart
[3:00:44] answer me we read the scripture
[3:00:48] together so he arose and went to
[3:00:52] hebon but ABS sent
[3:00:56] SP instead of going to serve the
[3:01:00] Lord he began planning and
[3:01:03] plotting how to take over
[3:01:07] theing and this is how sometimes people
[3:01:10] serve God
[3:01:12] mechanically
[3:01:15] if God has told you to do
[3:01:18] anything be genuine in
[3:01:20] your be
[3:01:23] sincere and do just that but the problem
[3:01:26] of it people are not
[3:01:29] sincere I have
[3:01:31] a go to
[3:01:36] where the truth is there is other things
[3:01:40] you have seen
[3:01:42] there your
[3:01:45] and you are lying to
[3:01:47] us we should be
[3:01:49] sincere God loves sincere
[3:01:53] heart this man reached there and began
[3:01:58] plotting calling others in other
[3:02:02] places we are taking over and soon
[3:02:06] everybody began
[3:02:10] AB he told the king is going to serve
[3:02:14] but now he's taking over the
[3:02:16] kingdom and and and and and so the Bible
[3:02:19] here's the part I wanted with AB went
[3:02:23] men out of
[3:02:28] Jerusalem that were
[3:02:30] called they went in their
[3:02:34] Simplicity and they knew not
[3:02:37] anything that's the part I
[3:02:39] wanted abom was very intelligent
[3:02:44] he knew how to approach the
[3:02:48] king he knew if I tell the king I'm
[3:02:53] going in heon to
[3:02:54] Ser he will not stop me and also he will
[3:02:58] give me some of his
[3:03:00] people so the king allowed him to
[3:03:03] go and Abed
[3:03:06] 200 in their
[3:03:09] Simplicity who knew not
[3:03:12] anything now this is the
[3:03:14] condition of many
[3:03:19] Believers preachers are very busy
[3:03:22] playing their
[3:03:24] politics but the people are in
[3:03:28] Simplicity they don't know anything and
[3:03:32] they found in such a
[3:03:34] sck why because of men who are pointing
[3:03:38] to
[3:03:40] themselves they will lead many people in
[3:03:43] simp and lead them to
[3:03:48] destruction AB did not Point people to
[3:03:50] the
[3:03:52] king to
[3:03:54] himself imagine 200 people following
[3:03:57] him
[3:03:59] simp today many people follow others
[3:04:01] knowing
[3:04:04] nothing may God help
[3:04:07] you that I will not follow people
[3:04:12] blindly
[3:04:14] let me tell you you people that are in
[3:04:16] this
[3:04:17] Fellowship I'm I'm
[3:04:19] encouraging by the love of
[3:04:21] God what this message
[3:04:25] is get the spoken word books read
[3:04:29] them know what you
[3:04:31] believe know what someone will ask what
[3:04:33] is the
[3:04:36] message but many people are just
[3:04:39] following
[3:04:41] Simplicity the only thing they know
