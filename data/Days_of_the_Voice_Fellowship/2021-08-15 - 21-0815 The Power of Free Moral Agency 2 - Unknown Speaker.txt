make that decision to now do the thing immediately so we also had the three souls that believed yesterday one when they met mr exactly and myself and brother martin no organometallic we put two teams twice i went with brother joelle and brother marvin he's the knackers brother martin went with brother [Music] um and uh so we went in two teams and the purpose for the working out yesterday was not to reach new contact but it was to reach to the contracts which they we have believe as the young people had already reached out to in the first outreach met several times and these they had already had brother joel speak the first time they they loved it the second time someone tried to confuse them and then the third time you know brother joel felt like i will not manage them anymore so i need to bring the somewhere else can you take baptized before with their baptism they they have other people also that are desiring to hear this message brother gave one of the ladies a church edge book and she gave it to one of her brothers is it a brother yeah i think a brother and a i think he's a minister so no somewhere he's also interested in this message i'm told that he has always been coming to visit them during this locker down but after he got discharged he was not he is no longer visiting them he's very busy reading the messages some of the tribes men who were speaking his language i'm told he preached it for the whole of the evening and then also brother martin met some people who speak his language and oh my gosh that's wonderful i'm telling you people we can cause a revival to because this message is [Music] [Music] [Music] so we have to do [Music] you [Music] which says [Music] [Music] is [Music] without faith my life would be worthless who knows [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] he knows all my faith foreign [Music] is oh [Music] is [Music] is [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] if [Music] [Music] scripture in genesis chapter 4 verse 7. [Music] today we will be proceeding with a part two of the power of free moral agents [Music] father we are going to read your word we ask that the holy spirit will come and give us utterance this morning we are going to speak to the patches of the blood those that you purchased your church they cannot you bless them now speak to them in jesus name genesis chapter 4 verse 7 if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted yes if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted but and if thou doest not well see lieth at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou [Music] [Music] h may the lord bless you and bless the reading of his word [Music] i'm going to proceed or continue with the sharing i started last sunday because of the short time we usually have we are not able to always con complete the thought that god has given to us so that's why we have to have a part two or a part three or a part four because we have a short time in one service service so we want to bring it also in another service so we can be able to receive the whole benefit of it amen and that's the reason why i don't always want to hold you for so long two hours three hours we cannot read and understand the whole bible in one service but a bible so as usual take perhaps one hour or up to one hour i'm gonna join the twilight star one game if i delay maybe it will be about one hour and a half but i just pray that you give me your undivided attention seven way to call anyone uh listen we need that i know many things might sound new but i'm not going to have any doctrine today just start wishing money and we found out that there is a power that god has given man and this power which he has given man he has not given it to any other creature the bible does not say that the serpent came and beguiled the serpent that was in the oh the beast let me say that the serpent came and beguiled the beast a bible which is devil 27 that came down in the garden of eden and beguiled the serpent which we know is the beast that we don't believe that it was a snake speaking to it now we'll go get on a coward because it was not a snake commander the bible describes that god cast it afterwards and that's when it became a snake but at first it was a beast the bible says of all the peace that the lord god had made it was the most subtle baby [Applause] that serpent was more subject it was more intelligent than even the chimpanzees that is the only difference between us and that beast which was a which tempted eve of eden understanding where it comes he came straight to this place and he borrowed his body he entered into the body of that beast but you cannot get a seed of animals and mingle into the seed of a human being to bring forth or mingle into the egg of a woman or human being to bring forth life what happens [Music] theory of evolution [Music] they said that man was an animal he went on changing changing changing until he looks like he [Music] and his seed had the ability of mingling with that of the human race and bringing forth life [Music] [Music] [Music] the beast had no choice over their bodies as soon as [Music] [Music] and then all of a sudden my mom they felt something and killed themselves hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord someone said because of that we don't eat breeds oh one way again so if you don't eat the pigs because they they have demons also shouldn't eat water because it also had those demons go let us proceed with our teaching category so we find out to china that animals have no choice over what happens amen they are only like a proxy whatever happens it's all right tonight they have no power there are themselves and he knocked the choice was the choice the choice that she made to accept to each of the fruit of the tree [Music] because in genesis they were the ones in that transgression [Music] and also um it was not the man that sinned it was the woman that sinned shall be upon your husband [Music] you know someone some people think that when they go in marriage they are partners people working together on the same level and the bible says that the women must submit to their husbands in all things and so we go back to eve can you get today so because eve made a choice because of all the sicknesses because of that choice and what does this call the death because of that choice oh he has brought life the first one was a living soul a assault remaining but the second one is a awakening spirit hallelujah so now from that can you we are able it is called the power of free moral agencies each of you that is under the sound of my voice that do not try at any time to blame anyone for whatever happens in your life whatever happens in your life is your own making your whatever happens to you we are never going to say our own makings you have power to change the world around you [Music] amen i mean amen if you were born in a poor family for instance [Music] amen if you are born like the bible says we are all born in sin bible naturalism we have the power what would happen in your mind even within us muslims to make a choice we were born in sin but we shall not [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] no i'm here to tell you the name of our lord jesus christ those [Applause] and then god comes down and preaches his first summoner [Music] was rejected i want you to understand that cain is a seed of the [Applause] [Music] did you hear that oh god himself comes to stop and see me as preachers we only go out and preach we saw the next one we don't know who will come here we don't know who will be coming [Music] [Music] some people think that serpent syrup are only those who are born in the arab countries or those who are born in this place no serpent cities everywhere is we don't know as long making that choice even if you might [Music] [Music] no human being is meant to go to hell [Music] let me ask you a question [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] but here is my teach you know i can still accept you it you you just wanna cook it if you use the power which is in you single for the salmon that's power ammonia is the power as a free model agent [Music] [Music] waiting for [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] he says but thou shalt rule over him [Music] in other words sin deserves to have you hey you can rule over it you have power to conquer [Music] i will not be a to god until i get married [Music] [Music] [Music] and you can drive it but it depends which key you are using to drive it you can drive it with the reason or you can drive it with faith okay give me the quote he says in the garden of eden they never chose a man is hate it isn't a message fasting for life the devil chose a man around god took his heart cattle diana my brother don't trust your head don't trust your reasoning the way i'm against the god is the devil's area uh [Music] the devil tries to show him what he can see with his eyes god in his heart makes him believe things by faith that he cannot see katia told because god in our heart makes us believe things that we cannot see [Music] [Music] [Applause] you believe god by faith it let us read romans 6 12 it says let not sin that are for reign in your mother body that you should obey it in the lust thereof neither you would ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness and to sin but you yield yourselves unto god as those that

verses 12. he says oh we're in romans 2 we're supposed to be in romans 6. he says therefore do not let sin reign in your motor body so that you obey its last and passions [Music] [Music] he says but offer yourselves to god in a decisive act [Music] i have decided it's not god deciding for you gotta understand how excited you are but offer yourselves to god in a decisive act [Music] [Music] you know what it means to die it means you you you no longer exist how can you keep your friends and hang out with the same people you used to hang out with when you were alive [Music] wow [Music] [Music]
