[1:08:17] service
[1:08:18] that uh Pastor I'm sorry we've turned
[1:08:21] this into a Revival meeting
[1:08:25] because after the the little preaching
[1:08:28] you know we had a prayer line of more
[1:08:30] than 30 minutes
[1:08:34] it was a good time young people had a
[1:08:38] good time in worship
[1:08:43] I think it was a wonderful
[1:08:46] amen Amina so after the service
[1:08:49] yesterday
[1:08:54] of course as you know we are we've been
[1:08:57] reaching out there for some time now
[1:09:02] the Hashem being there as a student
[1:09:07] um
[1:09:10] so they can kind of came up with an idea
[1:09:14] there could be meeting
[1:09:33] so I don't know maybe this was the
[1:09:36] fourth time
[1:09:42] for yeah fourth time for me to go
[1:09:45] and uh this time
[1:09:47] we shared with them on the original
[1:09:50] scene
[1:09:54] it was a very good experience
[1:09:57] you know these young people just love
[1:09:59] the Lord
[1:10:00] you know and we were able to get to sit
[1:10:03] down I thought we'll do it for 30 or 40
[1:10:05] minutes but we did for more maybe two
[1:10:08] hours and a half or more
[1:10:13] and they were just receptive
[1:10:17] and had many questions
[1:10:20] it was a really nice thing please pray
[1:10:23] for the I call it the Revival in
[1:10:25] entirely pray for that Reviving
[1:10:28] we never know what the Lord would do
[1:10:32] was telling me we need to start a
[1:10:34] fellowship there
[1:10:36] but who knows what the Lord
[1:10:45] she told me that she was or is a
[1:10:49] preacher
[1:10:52] and so uh we've been sharing the message
[1:10:56] among the students
[1:11:03] [Music]
[1:11:05] than the others
[1:11:12] and that this is our second time to come
[1:11:13] and be with us in the service
[1:11:18] you know and yesterday was it yesterday
[1:11:22] or the other day she told me she's ready
[1:11:23] for baptism today
[1:11:30] just right over here
[1:11:33] can you come and tell us whether you're
[1:11:35] ready for water baptism
[1:11:48] um my first time to be baptized I was
[1:11:51] baptized in the
[1:11:52] the name of the Father the Son and the
[1:11:55] Holy Spirit
[1:12:01] and I was baptized after me knowing that
[1:12:04] it is one of the acts that we should do
[1:12:07] as Christians
[1:12:12] but then last weekend when I shared with
[1:12:14] pasta
[1:12:17] I got to know that this is not the right
[1:12:20] way
[1:12:23] and then I chose to be baptized again
[1:12:27] thank you
[1:12:31] again
[1:12:37] well the right way is for one to be
[1:12:41] immersed in water ingredients
[1:12:45] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:12:52] so much so um you know she listened in
[1:12:56] last weekend when she was here yeah
[1:13:01] and I love the way she said he said this
[1:13:03] is too much let me digest it for a while
[1:13:08] [Music]
[1:13:10] after the weekend she told me now I'm
[1:13:12] ready
[1:13:15] I will come to that moment
[1:13:19] it's a wonderful thing to have the word
[1:13:21] bath
[1:13:23] to be born of the word
[1:13:26] it's a nice nice
[1:13:31] and so today after the service
[1:13:34] today
[1:13:36] and pray that God will fill her with the
[1:13:39] Holy Ghost
[1:13:41] I just told her she's ready to continue
[1:13:43] justifying she should be ready
[1:13:48] as much as a woman cannot be a preacher
[1:13:51] or a pastor or you know any of those
[1:13:53] things
[1:13:56] but it doesn't mean she cannot justify
[1:13:58] about what she has received
[1:14:02] amen amen and so
[1:14:06] um we also I wanted to let you know that
[1:14:08] in next month I'm traveling to Ethiopia

[1:19:15] that this will not be able to
[1:19:18] fully Finance the whole budget well what
[1:19:21] it is
[1:19:29] and I know others probably stream this
[1:19:32] much later or from other churches we
[1:19:34] want to I want to let them know
[1:20:03] both on YouTube and also whatever so
[1:20:06] tell them you know we need we need you

[1:20:16] when you're sending your contribution we
[1:20:18] just capture your details and we put it
[1:20:20] in our registered

[1:20:27] paying
[1:20:28] um maybe part of it or all of it or even
[1:20:31] more than that whatever you can be able
[1:20:33] to contribute
[1:20:36] but
[1:20:38] you can do that by mobile management
[1:20:42] mechanism
[1:20:52] but for us here now yes
[1:20:54] the members here the members are
[1:20:57] requesting each of us
[1:21:00] to contribute at least a hundred
[1:21:03] thousand
[1:21:06] the minimum you can do more
[1:21:13] if at least if 50 people gave a hundred
[1:21:18] thousand each that is five million Urban
[1:21:20] to attended
[1:21:23] that means we're going somewhere
