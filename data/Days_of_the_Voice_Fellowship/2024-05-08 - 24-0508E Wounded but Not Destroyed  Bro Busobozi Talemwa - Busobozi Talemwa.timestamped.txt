[31:03] the life also of Jesus might be made
[31:06] manifest in our body amen amen you may
[31:10] be
[31:12] seated this evening I'm speaking uh to
[31:15] you on the subject wounded but not
[31:26] destroyed wounded
[31:29] wounded say what I said not what you are
[31:32] reading okay
[31:35] wounded but not
[31:38] destroyed one time I did not prepare to
[31:41] give this story but it it just came to
[31:43] my memory years ago I read
[31:49] it I think I think brother bam talked
[31:53] about it in the message when love is
[31:54] projected
[31:59] and he was speaking about mother
[32:06] Oppam and so it was
[32:09] wounded and you know but you see God has
[32:12] a
[32:13] way that he led it from the
[32:18] wild and it came all the way to the
[32:21] house of the
[32:24] Prophet there were many people who were
[32:26] always going to the house of banam for
[32:27] prayers
[32:31] many of them of course we are
[32:33] wounded wounded because of
[32:37] sickness sometimes you know other
[32:39] spiritual
[32:41] conditions and you know others were
[32:44] dying you know the the world is wounded
[32:47] for the mo for the to the for the most
[32:50] [Music]
[32:52] part and so they are looking for a
[32:56] savior and and um and many of them get
[33:00] destroyed we find that many people today
[33:03] even today are committing
[33:07] suicide uh many of which are young
[33:11] people and they're losing their life
[33:13] because they they cannot find
[33:17] Solace they cannot find peace of
[33:20] mind when they are
[33:22] disappointed or when they let you know
[33:25] it is as if you have no savior
[33:30] went went was
[33:35] wounded
[33:38] and and you know the prophet gave back
[33:41] its
[33:43] life so I was thinking how much more the
[33:47] Sons and Daughters of
[33:50] God you know who are wounded when they
[33:53] are
[33:54] wounded doesn't God have a balm for us
[33:59] doesn't he have medicine for
[34:01] us does he have a solution for us well
[34:05] of course some of well of course some of
[34:07] you might say yes he has my problem is
[34:11] bigger well of
[34:13] course and their
[34:16] speciality and they will tell you
[34:17] whether they can be able to handle that
[34:19] wound or
[34:22] not I remember some years ago not even
[34:25] years months ago when General was
[34:32] short and you know they were in the car
[34:34] and he was
[34:36] short and you know his daughter died as
[34:40] a
[34:41] result but then he
[34:43] himself was shot as well but not killed
[34:47] he was not destroyed but he was
[34:51] wounded and and so they took him at a
[34:53] small and where I think I don't remember
[34:56] the name where they could
[34:59] him and later on when he came out of the
[35:02] hospital he said he had been
[35:04] wounded and he had been shot
[35:07] at but the bullet couldn't be taken
[35:11] out so but they treated him you remove
[35:15] it you may lose the
[35:18] patient and and so he was
[35:23] wounded and I'm going to deal with that
[35:25] and then I I I he became a soldier of
[35:28] the army of the
[35:30] Lord and I believe he's my
[35:33] brother so I am a soldier also of the
[35:35] army of the
[35:37] Lord I am
[35:39] recruited Hallelujah do I have some
[35:42] people here who are
[35:44] recruited we are recruited to this
[35:47] Army this is an overcoming
[35:49] Army amen this is an army which is
[35:56] indestructible seen an army which is
[36:00] invisible where you can say that that is
[36:03] an
[36:04] army which cannot be
[36:07] destroyed no matter what you do to that
[36:10] Army you cannot
[36:12] destroy you had many armies
[36:15] before many men who fought and they won
[36:20] battles but you see I can talk I can
[36:22] take time to speak about each
[36:25] of but tonight I want ask speak about
[36:28] the army of the
[36:30] Lord Christians when we are recruited to
[36:33] this
[36:36] Army we are
[36:38] equipped with the necessary
[36:42] weapons to overcome our
[36:46] enemy each of us is in a
[36:50] battle Christianity is the hardest thing
[36:52] in the
[36:55] world it is not as easy as something
[36:58] things Christianity is not a Bed of
[37:02] Roses it is a battle we fight every day
[37:07] we fight
[37:08] daily we struggle daily don't you think
[37:12] because we say we are
[37:15] believer that you know we can be able to
[37:17] do everything the Bible
[37:20] says who who does that with
[37:24] EAS 100% with EAS
[37:28] even a man who came to
[37:30] Jesus and he said I have done I've lived
[37:33] according to the law
[37:36] everything all my life Jesus looked at
[37:40] him and he said it's all right you are
[37:43] fine you have fulfilled the law but
[37:46] there is one more thing he said go sell
[37:49] everything you
[37:50] have give it to the poor come follow me
[37:54] and the Bible says he went away
[37:58] so it was not easy for him to walk that
[38:02] road it is not easy for anyone to walk
[38:05] the Christian
[38:09] Journey but I tell you what at the end
[38:12] of it all it will pay off for all the
[38:16] things you
[38:18] sacrifice for all the things you
[38:22] fought for the
[38:24] perseverance for the long suffering for
[38:27] the
[38:28] patience for the fighting for the
[38:31] praying at the end of the
[38:34] day when we leave these
[38:37] bodies it will all become
[38:40] clear it will all mean
[38:43] something but right now it seems as if
[38:46] it is
[38:47] impossible but I tell you what the army
[38:50] of the
[38:51] Lord cannot be
[38:53] destroyed and Apostle Paul was one of
[38:55] those in that army
[39:00] and uh in Acts 14 verse
[39:05] 19 he said and there came th certain
[39:08] Jews from Antioch and ionium who
[39:11] persuaded the people and having ston
[39:12] Paul Drew him out of the city supposing
[39:15] he had been dead
[39:33] something I want you to see
[39:35] today hallelujah hallelujah if you open
[39:38] your spiritual
[39:40] ears God will speak to you in a special
[39:42] way
[39:43] today how to
[39:46] open all right now I want you to see
[39:50] here is a man of
[39:51] God that was
[39:53] called in a powerful
[39:56] calling do you know how he was called a
[39:59] pillar of light
[40:01] came and shined where he was and a voice
[40:05] came out of it and he said so so why do
[40:09] you persecute and he said who are you my
[40:12] lord then he said I am Jesus it is hard
[40:16] for the to kick against the
[40:18] priest let me tell you if you were
[40:20] called by
[40:22] God you can try to
[40:24] run but you can never run away from this
[40:29] you can never run away from this
[40:31] voice others may try to discourage
[40:34] you but you can never run away from this
[40:37] voice many things may happen in your
[40:40] life in my life to try to discourage you
[40:45] but even if I wanted to I cannot run
[40:48] away from this voice because why my
[40:52] soul is
[40:55] Anchor whereby whenever whatever I
[40:58] run I still come back here whever you
[41:02] run you may run in your thoughts you may
[41:05] run in your actions you may run in your
[41:07] mind but you will still come
[41:10] back because you are
[41:13] anchored amen and we we find that there
[41:15] are others who will run
[41:17] away we are not afraid about those
[41:21] because they are not
[41:22] anchored but when the ship is
[41:25] anchored no matter where the waves beat
[41:28] and
[41:31] pushed the Sheep will remain
[41:35] un there's something I'm coming to
[41:37] here and there came so now here Paul
[41:41] having received a great calling in his
[41:45] life he started to go out with
[41:48] Zeal with the power of the Holy
[41:51] Ghost
[41:52] preaching and and and you know and and
[41:56] working miracles
[41:58] and now we
[41:59] see some when he reached this this place
[42:01] called I think it was called listra
[42:03] something like
[42:05] that and um and uh the people the
[42:11] Jews they connived among each
[42:15] other let us kill
[42:17] him so they got stones and start
[42:21] stoning imagine they stoned
[42:26] him and they drew him out of the
[42:30] city they stoned
[42:33] him and they pulled
[42:35] him after stoning
[42:38] him and they pulled him out of the city
[42:43] thre him out
[42:44] there and they thought
[42:48] he Hallelujah hallu someone has not
[42:52] received
[42:53] Revelation while I'm talking about these
[42:55] things I want you to look at your life
[43:00] when they pulled
[43:02] Paul after stoning him they thought he
[43:06] was dead I have a question for you why
[43:09] did they do that to
[43:11] him it was because of what he stood
[43:15] for now when I tell it is the devil who
[43:18] did it you will say no it is the people
[43:22] no it was the
[43:24] devil because the devil knows
[43:28] those that have a mark of God on
[43:32] them and the devil is interested in only
[43:36] one to kill to destroy to completely
[43:41] remove
[43:42] you that's the purpose of the devil
[43:45] that's the purpose of the devil in my
[43:46] life in your
[43:48] life as an individual he wants you to
[43:52] quit he wants you to go away he wants
[43:56] you to be disced
[43:58] he doesn't want you to serve God he will
[44:01] do everything he
[44:02] can he will bring up
[44:05] something he will bring a sin in your
[44:07] life which will discourage you he will
[44:10] bring people in your life who will
[44:13] discourage you he will bring things in
[44:15] your life which will discourage you by
[44:18] wounding
[44:19] you but the purpose of the devil is to
[44:23] kill you is to destroy you and here he
[44:27] had thought he had killed and destroyed
[44:31] Paul and Drew him out of the
[44:33] city him out out of the place where he
[44:36] was supposed to
[44:38] be and he thought they thought he had
[44:41] died one of these days I need to preach
[44:44] on
[44:45] that when the devil thought I had
[44:50] died there is a time when the devil does
[44:53] something in your
[44:54] life and he begins to think
[44:58] he's dead this one he will not come
[45:02] back you know when the devil gives you a
[45:04] knock
[45:05] out he thinks ah this one is gone there
[45:09] is not coming back there is no
[45:11] resurrecting but I tell you what brother
[45:14] there is a bride there is a church even
[45:18] she may be
[45:19] wounded she can never be
[45:23] destroyed hallelujah amen and this is
[45:26] exactly what happened
[45:29] was
[45:30] wounded the devil thought he
[45:32] had there was a time theil thought you
[45:36] die amen bu you in things and thought
[45:39] you are
[45:41] die you in desires and thought you will
[45:44] die am I preaching to someone here today
[45:48] bu you into
[45:50] actions things that you amen that made
[45:52] you go away from your place
[45:57] that made you even lose your desire of
[45:59] going to
[46:01] church that made you lose your desire of
[46:03] the love of the
[46:05] world whereby even when you lift up your
[46:08] hand you don't feel like worshiping
[46:11] anymore because the devil removed you
[46:13] from your
[46:14] place and whenever he saw you in that
[46:17] condition he was always
[46:20] rejoicing this time she's dead this time
[46:27] let me tell you
[46:28] brother even if the devil says that you
[46:31] are dead today is
[46:35] dead
[46:36] tell I'm not
[46:38] dead not
[46:40] dead I will not die I'm not going to die
[46:44] Hallelujah I am not going to die I'm
[46:47] going to remain
[46:49] living I'm going to be a Christian I'm
[46:52] going to serve God whether the devil
[46:55] likes it or not
[46:57] amen hallelujah that's why when you
[47:01] discouraged do what the devil tells you
[47:04] not to
[47:07] do when the Devil Makes You
[47:10] doubt doubt your
[47:13] doubts am I preaching to someone today
[47:16] when a Devil Makes You doubt the word of
[47:19] God doubt his that
[47:23] doubt doubt it amen because he wants you
[47:26] to he wants to make you
[47:29] doubt the ability of God to deliver
[47:33] youil I doubt
[47:36] that I doubt that are you not going to
[47:40] quit
[47:41] Christianity devil I doubt
[47:43] that are you not are you not really
[47:47] overcome devil I doubt that do you think
[47:50] you will make it devil I doubt that I'm
[47:54] only going to believe
[47:57] what the word of God has intended for
[48:00] me and when they St Paul they thought he
[48:04] had died and they drew him out of the
[48:08] city supposing he had been
[48:12] dead hallelujah hallelujah how bit as
[48:17] the disciples stood round about him he
[48:20] rose
[48:25] upu was standing around
[48:28] him come on now answer
[48:32] me the
[48:34] disciples not
[48:37] drunkers not
[48:40] smokers not
[48:41] adter not fornicators are you hearing me
[48:46] these are the things the devil wants to
[48:48] kill us
[48:52] with and these are the people who are
[48:54] beating him
[48:58] but when they threw him
[49:00] away the
[49:02] disciples stood around

[49:38] for you who will encourage you amen and
[49:42] do you know what it's going to happen

[49:52] week or four times of

[49:57] every
[49:58] day so that I can be

[1:10:49] be
[1:10:52] destroyed hallelujah amen the prophet of
[1:10:55] God says now we would
[1:10:57] think also today upon
[1:11:02] destructions trying to
[1:11:05] destroy we have Christ's
[1:11:12] promise we think of the Hebrew children
[1:11:14] when God had a purpose for
[1:11:18] them when they were down in
[1:11:21] Babylon and the furnace was hit seven
[1:11:24] times
[1:11:26] hotter than it ever
[1:11:31] was to try and destroy the purpose of
[1:11:34] God and all Babylon was on a
[1:11:38] ra they were
[1:11:41] determined Satan was to destroy the
[1:11:44] purpose of
[1:11:46] God for he knew those children was going
[1:11:49] to into the
[1:11:51] furnace hallelujah hallelujah so he made
[1:11:54] the furnace
[1:11:56] when they heed it seven times
[1:12:00] old to be sure that the program of God
[1:12:03] would be
[1:12:06] destroy but God wanted to
[1:12:10] display his
[1:12:13] power and all
[1:12:16] Babylon and Hell could not defeat that
[1:12:23] purpose amen yes
[1:12:26] sir oh it's unfortunate my wife is not
[1:12:28] here I don't know whether streaming is
[1:12:29] back
[1:12:31] or when we're leaving
[1:12:35] Ethiopia you know God spoke to my
[1:12:38] wife by the way I've never give another
[1:12:41] interpretation of usually God gives me
[1:12:43] interpretation of these
[1:12:45] things I had never got this one but just
[1:12:49] came to me now God spoke to her and and
[1:12:53] showed her you know were happening in
[1:12:57] Uganda at first God took her to
[1:13:01] hell and he showed a
[1:13:05] meeting in hell and it was demons that
[1:13:09] we had sat they had called for a meeting
[1:13:13] and what was the agenda the agenda was
[1:13:17] to destroy the Young
[1:13:19] Generation to destroy all the young
[1:13:22] people with Immortal living and
[1:13:28] life of
[1:13:32] God and and then when he showed her
[1:13:37] that he brought her back to
[1:13:41] us well the other part of it I won't say
[1:13:44] but I thought it meant
[1:13:47] something which need it was brother bam
[1:13:49] said that every word of God is has um um
[1:13:52] a compound meaning
[1:13:58] but now it comes to me God was trying to
[1:14:00] speak to
[1:14:02] us he's showing us the purpose of
[1:14:07] Satan the plan of the
[1:14:10] devil to destroy the young
[1:14:13] people in the message destroy
[1:14:16] them why because he was giving us a
[1:14:21] mandate to come down
[1:14:23] here and be part
[1:14:26] of the eort of the Holy
[1:14:28] Ghost to take them out of the
[1:14:31] bond of
[1:14:34] darkness and I tell you what God has
[1:14:37] fought this ministry the devil has
[1:14:39] fought this
[1:14:41] ministry he will fight continue to
[1:14:44] fight that's why we need to
[1:14:48] pray I don't know how many people pray
[1:14:50] for me in the
[1:14:52] church but you need to pray for me
[1:14:55] because when the devil sees
[1:14:57] something that is going to hinder his
[1:15:01] plan then he will try his
[1:15:04] best he will hit the
[1:15:06] furnace seven times to
