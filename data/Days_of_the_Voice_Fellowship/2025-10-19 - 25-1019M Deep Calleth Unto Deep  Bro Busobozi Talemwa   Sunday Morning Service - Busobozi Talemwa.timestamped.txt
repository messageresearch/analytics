[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; I'm so happy this morning.
[1:39:32] because I have found her.
[1:39:36] It has not been easy.
[1:39:41] I've been trying there and there
[1:39:44] trying to look for her.
[1:39:48] Uh I've been moving in different
[1:39:52] churches.
[1:39:55] I'm not seeing her.
[1:39:58] But one day
[1:40:00] It was in our youth meeting.
[1:40:04] She passed.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; I was like, "Oh my god."
[1:40:12] I was like, "Finally, I found her."
[1:40:17] Since then,
[1:40:20] my heart has not been the same.
[1:40:28] My darling,
[1:40:31] as Christ loved the church,
[1:40:34] as I I love you,
[1:40:37] I going to love you,
[1:40:40] support you,
[1:40:42] cherish you
[1:40:44] as long as I live
[1:40:47] in bad moment
[1:40:49] and good moment,
[1:40:52] I will love you.
[1:40:54] You made me a complete man.
[1:40:58] and you have brought joy in my heart.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; I love you so much.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; I'm a man of few.
[1:41:12] I have much to say
[1:41:15] but because of time
[1:41:18] I'll speak that for now.
[1:41:22] I have something to request you
[1:41:25] in presence of these brethren.
[1:41:30] But since this word is heavy,
[1:41:34] since this word is heavy,
[1:41:38] I can't speak it while I'm on my
[1:41:49] beautiful sweetheart,
[1:41:56] will you please marry me?
[1:42:02] Yes.
[1:42:14] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much.
[1:42:16] &gt;&gt; That's all, pastor.
[1:42:29] Sorry,
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; I have forgotten something.

[1:42:50] Oh,
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; I have something for you. My dear,
[1:43:01] love is beautiful.
[1:43:08] Um, just a disclaimer,
[1:43:11] I do not tell these young people what to
[1:43:13] do, what not to do.
[1:43:17] There are some people have jealousy
[1:43:21] Sometimes
[1:43:24] they come and say, "Pastor, why do you
[1:43:26] let them splash the love to us like
[1:43:28] that?"
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; I believe love is part of life.
[1:43:33] And if it's not built in church,
[1:43:37] you want it to be built in the bar,
[1:43:40] this is the right place.
[1:43:43] Amen. and and so personally
[1:43:46] I have no problem with the young people
[1:43:48] expressing themselves
[1:43:52] as long as it is genuine from

[1:44:30] with you
[1:44:33] because you are the author of it.
[1:44:36] You yourself, you are love. For the
[1:44:39] Bible says, God is love.

[1:44:45] in the book of Genesis in the in the
[1:44:46] Garden of Eden.
[1:44:53] And he that does not love
[1:44:56] does not have God. And Father, Lord,
[1:44:59] you've given love to these two
[1:45:03] each other. And as they desire to start
[1:45:06] this life's journey together,
[1:45:09] you commit them into your heart.
[1:45:12] And Lord as even they have announced
[1:45:14] their engagement today

[1:45:30] them until their wedding day.
[1:45:34] We give you thanks and pronounce them
[1:45:37] engaged.
[1:45:42] Amen. God bless you.

[1:47:59] I was not joking when I said last time
[1:48:00] that if we have a few in the pipeline,
[1:48:07] but we've been busy.
[1:48:10] You know when you see a person getting
[1:48:11] married it's not been easy
[1:48:16] a lot of time with them to do counseling
[1:48:19] and
[1:48:22] so um we just pray that God will bless
[1:48:26] and provide for everyone that is
[1:48:28] planning to get married
[1:48:31] and uh it's hard as a little church but
[1:48:34] you have to support each of them
[1:48:39] really try your best and support each
[1:48:41] other.
[1:48:44] Is that a myth?
[1:48:46] Amen. So, there's more coming.
[1:48:49] Let's just keep it in prayer. Also, I
[1:48:52] just came back from evening light right
[1:48:54] now.
[1:48:57] We usually have their morning service a
[1:48:58] little earlier.
[1:49:01] So, we minister to them this morning.
[1:49:04] Pastor brother Gava sent you greetings
[1:49:08] and the whole church there. Shall we
[1:49:10] stand on our feet? We go to Psalms 42.
[1:49:17] And as uh we are going into the word,
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; I just wanted to um let you know that on
[1:49:26] t on Tuesday.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; Uh I received pastor Tom, the pastor of
[1:49:35] Bible way

[1:49:47] uh we received them and we were with
[1:49:49] them on uh on on Thursday
[1:49:53] and on on on uh Friday

[1:50:28] started a little earlier
[1:50:32] and that will be about 5:00 p.m.
[1:50:36] So if you could try and come earlier,
[1:50:39] these are people who have traveled more
[1:50:41] than 27 hours.
[1:50:47] many places they can be around the
[1:50:49] world.
[1:50:51] But being that we are going to have them
[1:50:53] in this little place,
[1:50:56] it's a honor.
[1:50:58] So uh come and be here
[1:51:02] and all of you come
[1:51:05] and those who have not come today inform
[1:51:09] them to come.

[1:51:13] regions of Uganda
[1:51:18] and so you don't you want to come and
[1:51:20] help me host them.
[1:51:24] Uh this church has been very supportive
[1:51:27] in the mission work
[1:51:32] really I can say that they made me
[1:51:37] what I am today

[1:51:56] years.

[1:52:07] Wednesday.
[1:52:10] Come and be here and let us see what the
[1:52:13] Lord will do for us.
[1:52:15] Psalms 42
[1:52:19] vers 1 to7.
[1:52:27] As the heart panteth after the water
[1:52:29] brook, so pantth my soul after thee, oh
[1:52:32] God. My soul thirsteth for God, for the
[1:52:34] living God. When shall I come and appear
[1:52:37] before God? My tears have been my meat
[1:52:39] and day and night. While they
[1:52:42] continually say unto me, "Where is thy
[1:52:44] God?" When I remember these things, I
[1:52:47] pour out my soul in me. I pour out my
[1:52:49] soul in me. For I had gone with the
[1:52:51] multitude. I went with them to the house
[1:52:53] of God with a voice of joy and praise
[1:52:57] with a multitude that kept holy day.
[1:53:01] Why art thou cast down, oh my soul, and
[1:53:05] why art thou disquened in me? Hope thou
[1:53:08] in God, for I shall yet praise him for
[1:53:11] the help of his countenance,
[1:53:14] oh my God, my soul is cast down within
[1:53:17] me. Therefore will I remember thee from
[1:53:20] the land of Jordan and and and of the
[1:53:23] Hmonites, from the hill of Misar. Deep
[1:53:27] calleth unto deep at a no at the noise
[1:53:31] of thy water spouts. All thy waves and
[1:53:34] thy billows are gone over me.
[1:54:38] Foreign
[1:54:47] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:55:18] Amen.
[1:55:21] Let us pray. Loving Jesus,
[1:55:25] we would like to commit uh this moment
[1:55:27] now in your hands.
[1:55:31] Lord, may you cause us to have divine
[1:55:35] inspiration
[1:55:39] in preaching,
[1:55:41] receiving also.

[1:55:45] my voice today.

[1:55:52] and may we not leave this place the
[1:55:53] same.

[1:56:09] calleth unto the deep.
[1:56:16] Nice to see uh brother.
[1:56:21] He's been away for a while.
[1:56:26] Our prophet brother Bham preached on
[1:56:27] this subject. The deep calleth unto the
[1:56:29] deep.
[1:56:34] Brother, are you able to show our
[1:56:36] website here? You you know it. Can you
[1:56:39] try if you have? Do you have internet?
[1:56:43] Um, so if you go on our website,
[1:56:49] one of the pages there,
[1:56:52] I think I'll take as one of the days on
[1:56:55] a Sunday and I show you because many of
[1:56:57] you don't know.
[1:57:01] We now have a new website
[1:57:05] and uh quite a lot of information is
[1:57:08] there.
[1:57:10] We are even trying to uh put a lot of
[1:57:13] subjects and you know on on the on what
[1:57:16] we believe
[1:57:21] for you to be able to um to to to to
[1:57:26] read that and maybe share it with your
[1:57:28] friends.
[1:57:34] Um
[1:57:36] so there is this page called the
[1:57:38] messenger
[1:57:44] and on that page
[1:57:47] you will find that sermon the deep call
[1:57:50] it through the deep
[1:57:55] you have it no okay so I will show you
[1:57:58] I'll prepare and show you it to you in
[1:57:59] one of the services
[1:58:02] and Um you know
[1:58:05] u to those of you who don't know the
[1:58:08] website is called dvf fellowship.org
[1:58:12] dvf fellowship dot
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; dv
[1:58:17] fellowship dvf fellowship.org
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Yes. So if you go there and then you go
[1:58:24] to the page called the messenger
[1:58:30] begin with a question who was William
[1:58:33] Marian Brham
[1:58:39] to talk about the pill of fire
[1:58:43] to talk about you know that give you
[1:58:45] that 57 minute sermon
[1:58:50] called the deep calleth to
[1:58:54] And we'll also give you the interview.
[1:58:57] Some people interviewed him
[1:59:03] uh regarding his ministry
[1:59:06] and it's called a 20th century prophet.
[1:59:12] The title of that video is called a 20th
[1:59:15] century.
[1:59:19] And these people who did this uh video
[1:59:21] interview were not even believers of
[1:59:22] this message.
[1:59:27] But somehow they wanted they called him
[1:59:30] the 20th century prophet
[1:59:34] because they noticed his ministry was
[1:59:36] extraordinary.
[1:59:38] And there's also some eyewitness
[1:59:40] accounts there
[1:59:45] on that page.
[1:59:47] Yeah. So there's a lot there.
[1:59:51] So but um I'm not exactly going to speak
[1:59:53] what he spoke but maybe
[1:59:57] uh but I just pray that the Holy Spirit
[1:59:59] will lead us today.
[2:00:02] Are you ready for the what?
[2:00:05] Ask your neighbor, are you ready for the
[2:00:10] what did they say?
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; They ready.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Okay. So if you are ready, I want to
[2:00:16] hear your amen.
[2:00:19] So these words were written by David.
[2:00:24] See, David was expressing a spiritual
[2:00:26] experience,
[2:00:30] not just an emotion,
[2:00:34] but a yearning,
[2:00:37] you know, a deep within him for God.
[2:00:43] He said, "As the heart panteth after the
[2:00:46] water brooks,
[2:00:49] so pantth my soul after thee, oh God.
[2:00:53] My soul thirsteth for God,
[2:00:58] for the living God."
[2:01:01] There was something inside him crying.
[2:01:05] Something in him was crying for
[2:01:07] something that was outside.
[2:01:12] And that thing outside was the presence
[2:01:14] of the living God.
[2:01:18] If you are like David, a real son of
[2:01:21] God, a real daughter of God, you are
[2:01:24] going to have a punting, a desire within
[2:01:26] you.
[2:01:29] Not just for religion,
[2:01:31] but for a living God.
[2:01:35] A God that does miracles.
[2:01:37] A God that makes impossible things
[2:01:39] possible.
[2:01:42] A God that can provide you a job.
[2:01:46] A God that can give you the desire of
[2:01:48] your heart.
[2:01:51] A God that can fill your thirst or your
[2:01:53] hunger in your heart.
[2:01:57] You see um in the message expectation
[2:02:02] the prophet of God says I believe David
[2:02:04] said when the deep callth to the deep
[2:02:10] If there is a deep calling
[2:02:14] uh there is a deep to respond to
[2:02:16] somewhere.
[2:02:19] If there is a deep in you calling
[2:02:23] there is a deep somewhere
[2:02:26] to respond to that deep.
[2:02:30] You have heard a brother Enoch
[2:02:33] saying he had a deep in him calling
[2:02:37] and he went everywhere looking.
[2:02:40] Why did he go looking?
[2:02:43] Because there was someone somewhere
[2:02:45] waiting.
[2:02:49] So if there is a deep in you calling for
[2:02:51] something,
[2:02:53] there is something somewhere to satisfy
[2:02:56] that longing you have in your life.
[2:03:02] Amen. In other words, I've said now, oh,
[2:03:04] my sound is awful today. if you can help
[2:03:06] me brothers. You see um and by the way
[2:03:09] we are trying to uh I just wanted to say
[2:03:11] this we we need to buy a new mixer
[2:03:16] try to look at you know we need several
[2:03:18] millions for those things.
[2:03:21] So if you want to support work with us
[2:03:23] on that please
[2:03:27] all right now let's continue here.
[2:03:30] Praise God.
[2:03:32] Praise God.
[2:03:34] So, in other words,
[2:03:36] as I've often said, before there was a
[2:03:39] fin on a fish's back,
[2:03:45] there had to be a water first for him to
[2:03:48] use that fin in
[2:03:55] or he wouldn't have the fin.
[2:04:00] If there is a a tree to grow on the
[2:04:02] earth,
[2:04:06] there has to be an earth for it to grow
[2:04:12] or there would be no tree.
[2:04:16] So if there is something in you that
[2:04:18] calls out,
[2:04:22] I'm now in another message. as the ego
[2:04:23] stirs up on us. If there is something in
[2:04:26] you that calls out,
[2:04:29] there is something in you that longs for
[2:04:31] God.
[2:04:34] You know, you can be living in a life
[2:04:35] that is not right.
[2:04:38] You can be doing something that you know
[2:04:39] is wrong.
[2:04:42] But you feel there is a yearning in you
[2:04:43] to be better.
[2:04:47] So something in you that calls for God
[2:04:52] and you try to satisfy that thirst
[2:04:54] that's in you.
[2:04:56] You know as David said as the heart
[2:04:58] thirst after the water brook
[2:05:03] so my soul thirst after thee.
[2:05:06] Oh God
[2:05:09] and brother Bham says and you try to
[2:05:11] satisfy that blessed holy thirst.
[2:05:17] that God put in you
[2:05:20] to thirst after him
[2:05:24] and you try to satisfy it with the
[2:05:26] things of the world.
[2:05:33] But the difference we satisfy that
[2:05:36] thirst differently.
[2:05:39] You try to satisfy,
[2:05:42] you know, when you're thirsty, you try
[2:05:44] and and and find water.
[2:05:49] Imagine if you're so thirsty
[2:05:51] and they give you soda.
[2:05:53] You drink, but you don't feel
[2:05:56] they give you,
[2:05:59] they give you porridge.
[2:06:01] I'm looking for something.
[2:06:04] That thing must be there.
[2:06:08] The original must be there.
[2:06:11] If there are many things to try and help
[2:06:13] you quench that thirst,
[2:06:17] but they're not helping you, then that
[2:06:19] real thing must be there.
[2:06:22] The real water must be there.
[2:06:26] So if you're thirsting for God,
[2:06:28] don't settle for anything else.
[2:06:32] Keep looking.
[2:06:34] Keep searching because there is a living
[2:06:38] God
[2:06:40] that satisfies our thirst. Praise God.
[2:06:45] Amen. He says the devil is trying to
[2:06:46] make you quench that thirst by serving
[2:06:48] him.
[2:06:53] When you are a eagle,
[2:06:56] you was born to be an eagle
[2:07:00] and you have no right to quench that
[2:07:01] thirst with the things of the world.
[2:07:06] God gave you that thirst to thirst after
[2:07:09] him.
[2:07:13] Blessed are they that do hunger and
[2:07:17] thirst.
[2:07:20] For righteousness,
[2:07:22] for they shall be.
[2:07:26] So if you have a thirst,
[2:07:28] there is something to feel.
[2:07:31] Hallelujah. Every spiritual longing
[2:07:36] in the soul of a believer
[2:07:39] is an echo for God is called.
[2:07:46] If you have any longing in your heart,
[2:07:51] there is a call.
[2:07:55] That thirst is trying to respond to that
[2:07:57] call.
[2:08:01] How do you know your body needs water?
[2:08:06] God naturally
[2:08:08] put in you something
[2:08:12] that will make you understand
[2:08:15] that the body system needs um water
[2:08:21] and it is called thirst.
[2:08:25] If you do not give your body water,
[2:08:28] you will get constipation.
[2:08:33] Constipation.
[2:08:35] And when you get constipation,
[2:08:38] you can even get a surgery.
[2:08:41] It is serious. It's not small. It's a
[2:08:44] big thing.
[2:08:46] Thirst.
[2:08:48] You have to respond to that.
[2:08:51] If you get thirst and say well I must
[2:08:55] not drink water I am okay then you are
[2:09:00] ignoring the very thing that is going to
[2:09:02] help you.
[2:09:06] We have seen that even science tells us
[2:09:10] you are supposed to drink water before
[2:09:12] you become thirsty.
[2:09:16] The body needs water naturally.
[2:09:20] Praise God. So you must drink water
[2:09:22] regularly
[2:09:25] in certain amounts
[2:09:27] at certain times.
[2:09:29] But if you don't and you ignore other
[2:09:34] will give you a call
[2:09:37] and tell you hey
[2:09:39] you need water.
[2:09:42] But if you don't drink that water then
[2:09:45] you'll become sick.
[2:09:48] So now what is that fast?
[2:09:51] It's a call
[2:09:54] is to tell you hey there is something
[2:09:56] needed down here.
[2:09:59] But you see you cannot thirst for
[2:10:01] something that does not exist.
[2:10:06] You thirst for something that is already
[2:10:08] provided.
[2:10:13] So you see the deep in you
[2:10:17] responds to the deep in God.
[2:10:21] Hallelujah. Whatever God wants to give
[2:10:24] you. By the way, how do you know? By the
[2:10:28] end of this sermon, you will know this.
[2:10:30] How do you know that God wants to give
[2:10:32] you something?
[2:10:34] He gives you a thirst.
[2:10:38] When the deep calls,
[2:10:41] it's not mere religion.
[2:10:45] It's destiny. answering to its source.
[2:10:51] Why are you here this morning? You may
[2:10:54] some of you came even when you don't
[2:10:55] want.
[2:10:57] Some of you felt like I didn't charge
[2:11:01] but still you are here. Why? Can you
[2:11:04] answer me? Come on, answer me. Why are
[2:11:06] you here? Even to some of you who were
[2:11:09] forced by somebody,
[2:11:12] but you came. I didn't call you. I
[2:11:15] didn't talk to you. I didn't beg you to
[2:11:17] come. But you came because there is a
[2:11:20] thirst in your heart.
[2:11:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. You are hungering for something.
[2:11:27] Praise God.
[2:11:30] &gt;&gt; Brother, look, I audio is not good
[2:11:32] today.
[2:11:33] &gt;&gt; But I have decided to abandon to like
[2:11:35] ignore that
[2:11:36] &gt;&gt; because there's something I want to
[2:11:37] deliver.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; I don't want anything to stand in the
[2:11:40] way of that.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; Listen.
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; Why am I here? Why am I seeking after
[2:11:45] God? Because I there's a deep calling.
[2:11:50] There must be a deep somewhere to
[2:11:52] respond.
[2:11:54] And let me tell you, you can never force
[2:11:58] someone to receive God.
[2:12:02] You can never do that. I can never force
[2:12:05] you to believe.
[2:12:07] You believe because you have a thirst.
[2:12:13] If someone doesn't have hunger,
[2:12:16] you can cook them fish and and and and
[2:12:18] rice and everything.
[2:12:22] It will not it will be like I'm not
[2:12:25] interested. No appetite,
[2:12:28] no appetite is a sign of sickness.
[2:12:32] If you've been treating someone and they
[2:12:35] begin to become well,
[2:12:37] tell me what is the first thing they ask
[2:12:39] for?
[2:12:42] Then you know ah they're becoming better
[2:12:45] because you see the hunger
[2:12:47] is showing the system is going back to
[2:12:50] normal
[2:12:53] and when they don't want anything
[2:12:56] is a sign of sickness.
[2:12:59] Now spiritually speaking it is the same
[2:13:00] thing
[2:13:02] we have. If you have a hunger for God,
[2:13:06] if you have a thirst after the things of
[2:13:07] God,
[2:13:09] brother, that's the God's way of calling
[2:13:11] you,
[2:13:14] of telling you, you are my son. You are
[2:13:16] my child. I want to feel you. If you
[2:13:20] have a thirst for prayer, how many have
[2:13:23] ever had a thirst for prayer?
[2:13:25] Okay, you see how many have never had be
[2:13:30] sincere. Amen.
[2:13:33] Okay. No one has never or some of you
[2:13:36] don't know actually what it is.
[2:13:40] Can someone who knows come and tell us
[2:13:45] what is the thirst for prayer?
[2:13:49] How many have ever had it?
[2:13:52] I want to call someone. Come brother
[2:13:54] come. Have you ever heard it?
[2:13:58] How how is the Have you ever had thirst
[2:13:59] for water?
[2:14:01] How is the thirst for water?
[2:14:05] &gt;&gt; Give him the microphone.
[2:14:07] &gt;&gt; You find your throat is like drying.
[2:14:12] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And you feel like
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; You feel like you need to take water.
[2:14:15] &gt;&gt; You feel like you need to take water.
[2:14:18] How do you know it is water you want and
[2:14:20] not soda?
[2:14:22] Because even if you take any other
[2:14:24] things, it can't make it.
[2:14:33] You will try to take soda
[2:14:35] you you can't even take it but he has
[2:14:38] said you will feel you are not satisfied
[2:14:42] right what about the for prayer
[2:14:46] of prayer for me always when some
[2:14:49] situation is has come my way just come
[2:14:52] pray pray when you pray something happen
[2:14:54] immediately
[2:15:01] You see now many people when the thirst
[2:15:06] godly divine thirst comes
[2:15:10] they do not mind about satisfying that
[2:15:14] thirst.
[2:15:17] They let it pass.
[2:15:20] They let it pass. And that's why you are
[2:15:22] getting spiritual.
[2:15:27] The the call comes
[2:15:29] pray. You don't pray.
[2:15:33] You don't pray. Read the word. Read the
[2:15:35] word. You ignore it. You don't read the
[2:15:38] word. It's a call. If if if there is
[2:15:42] something, you know, you you don't know
[2:15:43] but you feel a hunger.
[2:15:46] Go to church. Fast. Do this. you know,
[2:15:50] seek after after righteous,
[2:15:52] repent, seek more of God, read the word,
[2:15:57] desire for the things of God. And you
[2:15:59] know, we always receive that call,
[2:16:03] but we dismiss it.
[2:16:05] And whenever you dismiss it, you have
[2:16:08] just dismissed the uh provision from
[2:16:11] God.
[2:16:15] When God wants to give you something,
[2:16:18] he will put that desire in you.
[2:16:22] When God created man,
[2:16:25] he breathed into him his own life.
[2:16:29] Now, Zoe is the nature of God.
[2:16:33] Now, we lost this life.
[2:16:36] But when we are born again,
[2:16:39] we have that very nature of God again
[2:16:42] right in us.
[2:16:45] So inside the elect is not just human
[2:16:48] desire
[2:16:53] is a seed gene of God
[2:16:56] that longs to return to his origin.
[2:17:03] Have you ever seen a man that has thirst
[2:17:05] for cigarette?
[2:17:09] You know if a person has a thirst for
[2:17:11] cigarette
[2:17:13] you cannot try to stop them
[2:17:17] you can't tell them to quit
[2:17:20] no man can quit cigarette
[2:17:23] except with the help of God
[2:17:26] and so is any other addiction
[2:17:30] you know someone will be there but when
[2:17:31] they become nervous
[2:17:35] and then you'll get a cigarette
[2:17:42] Why? Because it's a thirst
[2:17:45] within them is a nature
[2:17:49] that longs for it.
[2:17:52] So you see
[2:17:55] the real nature
[2:17:58] of God in the child in the in the heart
[2:18:00] of a child of God
[2:18:04] is to long for the things of God.
[2:18:08] And what what the devil does,
[2:18:11] he replaces that longing
[2:18:16] and he tries to make us thirst after the
[2:18:18] things of the world.
[2:18:22] But the thirst is genuine.
[2:18:26] But the devil perverts the thirst.
[2:18:30] And I'm not talking about something that
[2:18:32] is from another planet.
[2:18:34] I'm talking about the realistic things
[2:18:38] because each of us thus and that's why
[2:18:41] you find someone addicted to something
[2:18:45] that they do it.
[2:18:47] What are they looking for? They are
[2:18:49] looking for satisfaction.
[2:18:53] But after they do it, they are not
[2:18:56] satisfied.
[2:18:59] There is still a void.
[2:19:02] Why? Because that's not the real thing.
[2:19:08] You drink soda, you drink, you drink,
[2:19:10] you drink all this, it cannot help
[2:19:13] until you find a real water.
[2:19:18] That's why a true son or daughter of God
[2:19:22] cannot be satisfied with church programs
[2:19:25] only.
[2:19:28] you know just getting a position in
[2:19:30] church
[2:19:32] or just religion
[2:19:34] there is something deeper in our heart
[2:19:39] that is crying out
[2:19:42] that's why we are not in the Catholic
[2:19:43] church this morning
[2:19:47] we are not in some of these you know uh
[2:19:49] churches
[2:19:51] we have come in this little place not
[2:19:54] because it's more beautiful than all the
[2:19:55] others
[2:19:57] but there is something here that
[2:20:00] satisfies us differently than what the
[2:20:02] other things can satisfy us.
[2:20:07] Whenever we come and hear the word,
[2:20:11] you know, we feel satisfied.
[2:20:13] Amen. Praise God. I remember my mama
[2:20:16] told me last time
[2:20:19] because uh one of her fathers was um a a
[2:20:23] priest
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; in the Catholic church.
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And so she went there
[2:20:32] in in the you know when when he died and
[2:20:35] you know there were just you know very
[2:20:38] many fathers and brothers and more
[2:20:41] people would come and so now they this
[2:20:44] was like how do they call the mass.
[2:20:48] So now they started he started they
[2:20:49] started preaching
[2:20:51] but she told me as she heard them talk
[2:20:56] she could feel that no one is satisfied
[2:20:58] not even herself
[2:21:03] and surely those people are suffering
[2:21:06] there's a lot of famine of the word
[2:21:10] and that's why we should thank God for
[2:21:12] this precious end time message
[2:21:16] because when you hear the word. You feel
[2:21:19] satisfied.
[2:21:22] Lord, I want more of you. Something
[2:21:24] cries out.
[2:21:26] Not more of the word, not more
[2:21:29] entertainment,
[2:21:31] more of your presence,
[2:21:34] more of your word, more of your power.
[2:21:38] You know, David said, "I fast, my heart
[2:21:40] thirst for a living God."
[2:21:46] I want you to see here in Ecclesiastes 3
[2:21:49] 11
[2:21:51] says he has made everything beautiful in
[2:21:54] his time
[2:21:57] also he has set the world in their heart
[2:22:02] and that is now KJV
[2:22:06] I want you to hear it in the amplified
[2:22:10] he has made everything beautiful and
[2:22:11] appropriate in his time in his
[2:22:17] He has also planted. Now, now listen,
[2:22:19] listen. There's a season.
[2:22:22] Now, please listen to me with one heart.
[2:22:25] Now, you see everything God makes it
[2:22:29] beautiful
[2:22:32] in its time.
[2:22:34] There's time for everything.
[2:22:37] So when it's time for something,
[2:22:42] you will know it's the time.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; He has also planted eternity
[2:22:52] which you said a sense of divine purpose
[2:23:02] in the human eye.
[2:23:07] You see a mysterious longing
[2:23:12] which nothing under the sun can satisfy
[2:23:22] except God.
[2:23:25] We've seen them over the years.
[2:23:28] They worship trees. I come from a place
[2:23:32] in Muendi where there is a tree
[2:23:36] called
[2:23:38] which people literally go to worship.
[2:23:43] How many know about it?
[2:23:46] Oh, there are many people who don't
[2:23:47] know. Go and research it. Many people
[2:23:50] have made documentaries out of it.
[2:23:53] People go there to ask for a fruit of
[2:23:55] the womb.
[2:23:57] People
[2:23:59] go there to ask for promotion many
[2:24:02] things
[2:24:03] and you know because they're thirsting
[2:24:06] for those things and then they think
[2:24:09] that you know a tree will help them.
[2:24:13] I've seen in Ethiopia
[2:24:16] in some place where they go to a river
[2:24:21] is a very big group of people.
[2:24:24] They believe that that river
[2:24:28] There are some spirits there
[2:24:31] that will give them what they need.
[2:24:34] So they go there every once a year to
[2:24:36] worship
[2:24:39] and and um you know in many other
[2:24:41] traditions in Africa and also out of
[2:24:43] Africa.
[2:24:45] When I was in Australia,
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; they showed me a mountain
[2:24:50] where they say the Aboriginal people,
[2:24:52] the the natives there,
[2:24:55] you know, they go there, they believe
[2:24:57] that, you know, they will get the fruit
[2:24:59] of the womb.
[2:25:03] And today is a tourist attraction.
[2:25:07] But people still go and and to ask for
[2:25:08] children.
[2:25:11] Why do people do this thing? Because
[2:25:13] they have a thirst in their heart.
[2:25:16] But you see this thirst no nothing else
[2:25:20] can satisfy.
[2:25:22] Only God can.
[2:25:24] In Romans 8:23,
[2:25:27] he says that not only they but ourselves
[2:25:29] also which have the first fruits of the
[2:25:31] spirit,
[2:25:35] Even we ourselves grown within
[2:25:37] ourselves.
[2:25:40] What the scripture say? What do we do?
[2:25:43] We grown
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; grown
[2:25:47] within ourselves
[2:25:50] waiting for the adoption to the
[2:25:52] redemption of our bodies.
[2:25:57] That groaning is the deep calling.
[2:26:01] the adoption, the change of our bodies.
[2:26:05] Last time I talked about the theophony
[2:26:07] bodies.
[2:26:09] Each of us has one.
[2:26:12] And you see there is something within
[2:26:14] us.
[2:26:17] Longing for a body change,
[2:26:20] longing for our full adoption.
[2:26:26] That's why we come to hear the word.
[2:26:29] That's why we love to sing.
[2:26:31] That's why we love to worship.
[2:26:34] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you worship and you don't want
[2:26:36] to stop.
[2:26:38] Why? Sometimes you cry.
[2:26:41] You You didn't say, "Let me sing so I
[2:26:43] can cry."
[2:26:45] But as you are singing and then you feel
[2:26:48] like crying, you begin crying. You begin
[2:26:52] like feeling like throwing your hand up
[2:26:55] and woring. And when you hear the word,
[2:26:57] you feel good.
[2:26:59] What is it? It's a longing in our within
[2:27:03] us.
[2:27:06] You know, it is a groaning within every
[2:27:08] believer
[2:27:11] waiting for the adoption.
[2:27:14] Amen. The redemption of our body.
[2:27:18] Praise God.
[2:27:20] Now, that's the deep in us.
[2:27:24] But also, there is a deep in God.
[2:27:27] When a deep in man calls,
[2:27:30] it is because the deep in God first
[2:27:33] called
[2:27:41] in John 6:44.
[2:27:43] The scripture says, "No man can come to
[2:27:45] me
[2:27:47] except my father draw."
[2:27:52] How does how does he draw you?
[2:27:56] I've seen I've been in services
[2:27:59] where people have been baptized with the
[2:28:01] Holy Spirit.
[2:28:03] But you see, you find that one is
[2:28:06] baptized with the Holy Spirit,
[2:28:09] but another one on the side
[2:28:11] is just wondering what's happening
[2:28:16] like looking around as if it is a funny
[2:28:19] thing happening.
[2:28:23] Why? Because there is a deep calling in
[2:28:26] this person.
[2:28:29] And therefore when the deep in God calls
[2:28:34] it, this person will quickly respond.
[2:28:40] Let me tell you something.
[2:28:42] That's why you should never come to
[2:28:44] church before prayer.
[2:28:48] If you want God to do something for you,
[2:28:52] come prayed up.
[2:28:55] I wonder how many here doing.
[2:28:59] Come to church, pray down.
[2:29:02] You must have a desire.
[2:29:05] Don't just come. Have a desire. I
[2:29:09] remember there was, you know, when I had
[2:29:10] just first believed
[2:29:13] and I would, you know, before I got
[2:29:14] church, I would read my Bible.
[2:29:17] and pray say God speak to me as I'm
[2:29:19] going to your house may you minister to
[2:29:21] me may you make the preacher just
[2:29:24] address my needs
[2:29:27] and whenever that would happen
[2:29:30] and this happened multiple times
[2:29:34] this preacher would always start with a
[2:29:37] scripture that I was reading
[2:29:41] and the moment that would happen
[2:29:44] I would just be in heaven places.
[2:29:48] So people in church would see me
[2:29:50] excited
[2:29:52] shouting and rejoicing
[2:29:56] what's happening because they they are
[2:29:58] not where I am. So they can't understand
[2:30:02] has it ever happened to you? Yes. But if
[2:30:06] you come to church when you just let me
[2:30:09] go and see what is there
[2:30:11] whatever you were expecting
[2:30:14] you will get
[2:30:18] your expectation will be met.
[2:30:23] Tell your neighbor your expectation will
[2:30:25] be met.
[2:30:29] Your expectation will be met.
[2:30:33] Praise God. my expectation will be met.
[2:30:37] Brother Bham talked about expectation
[2:30:41] and he said whatever you expect
[2:30:45] when you come into the house of God
[2:30:49] you will get it
[2:30:53] focus here
[2:30:55] whatever you expect
[2:30:57] when you go in the house of God you will
[2:31:00] get he said if you expect to find a
[2:31:03] mistake
[2:31:05] or something wrong,
[2:31:07] you will find it.
[2:31:09] If you expect to find people who are not
[2:31:11] serious,
[2:31:13] you will find it. And I've often seen
[2:31:16] people who always concentrate on the
[2:31:19] negative things
[2:31:22] and they always want to spread it across
[2:31:24] the congregation
[2:31:28] and they will always come around and
[2:31:30] say, "Brother, are you not are you not
[2:31:32] seeing what's happening in the church
[2:31:33] these days? People
[2:31:36] are cold.
[2:31:38] There is no fire.
[2:31:40] There is no you know even I think people
[2:31:43] living in sin.
[2:31:45] Yeah. I think you are right.
[2:31:49] And then but I had not seen it
[2:31:53] but you when you come when you come this
[2:31:55] time
[2:31:58] you will see what I was saying. You see
[2:32:00] like sister nani brothers especially
[2:32:03] those ones you watch them and the person
[2:32:06] will come to church you think they have
[2:32:09] come expecting to hear from God they
[2:32:12] have come because of the of their gossip
[2:32:16] while while the world is going on they
[2:32:19] are very busy yeah brother this is
[2:32:20] better now they are very busy looking on
[2:32:22] the side
[2:32:24] told me to see brother
[2:32:27] is
[2:32:29] He's not dozing.
[2:32:33] Let me look. Yeah. This is what
[2:32:35] happening to sister Charity.
[2:32:40] Look at where she's.
[2:32:43] She's no longer serious.
[2:32:49] Now, of course, I'm not saying she is,
[2:32:50] but you get the point. So, now this
[2:32:54] person will become more
[2:33:00] And they also talk to another one.
[2:33:02] Brother, are you seeing what's happening
[2:33:04] in the church?
[2:33:06] That is a demon spirit moving in those
[2:33:08] people.
[2:33:11] Destroy the hearts of the expectant.
[2:33:17] That's why the prophet said when when
[2:33:20] we're going to have a service,
[2:33:23] don't come in late,
[2:33:26] come early.
[2:33:29] 30 minutes early.
[2:33:32] There's a a church I appreciated
[2:33:35] several, but I'll just mention
[2:33:38] church in Melbourne Melbourne.
[2:33:40] &gt;&gt; You know, I I saw that really happen
[2:33:47] what the prophet told and in other
[2:33:50] places, but I'll just mention that
[2:33:52] because it's what I felt when I entered
[2:33:54] in.
[2:33:56] You know these people arrive quite early
[2:34:03] 20 10 minutes before the service 20 they
[2:34:07] begin coming
[2:34:09] and 10 minutes before the service
[2:34:11] preaching
[2:34:13] rather before the song reading
[2:34:16] I'm already in the church
[2:34:20] fully seated
[2:34:22] no one moving
[2:34:24] no one talking to anybody
[2:34:26] Everybody is in meditation,
[2:34:29] praying,
[2:34:30] waiting upon God,
[2:34:33] having an expectation,
[2:34:35] maybe reading their Bible or reading a
[2:34:37] message book, waiting upon God, and I
[2:34:41] tell you what,
[2:34:43] song leader comes,
[2:34:46] people have been waiting for 30 minutes.
[2:34:50] The musicians have been on their
[2:34:53] planes.
[2:34:57] And when the song leader stepped up,
[2:35:01] oh, I loved that brother.
[2:35:03] You know, he sings like heaven has come
[2:35:05] down.
[2:35:07] He He sings, you can sing with all his
[2:35:08] heart.
[2:35:11] He's not singing to entertain anybody.
[2:35:14] He He was singing just to worship God.
[2:35:19] And the people too would join in.
[2:35:22] You will not see anybody looking around.
[2:35:25] You just see people closing their eyes
[2:35:28] worshiping God. You know I saw that
[2:35:30] brother you song leading you know oh God
[2:35:34] and you just do like this and worship
[2:35:36] God with all his heart
[2:35:40] and as soon as I walked in
[2:35:44] the presence of God came over me. I just
[2:35:47] felt like crying. I don't know what
[2:35:49] happens to me when the presence comes.
[2:35:51] feel
[2:35:54] so good and loved. I just love
[2:36:00] I just felt I wanted to be here.
[2:36:03] And when it came time to preach, I
[2:36:05] preached like I was going to die.
[2:36:08] I tell you friend, that is what brings
[2:36:11] the presence of the Holy Spirit.
[2:36:15] It's not a good preacher.
[2:36:18] It's not a good people.
[2:36:20] It is the people that have been
[2:36:22] expectant.
[2:36:24] If there is a deep within you calling,
[2:36:28] there will be a deep response.
[2:36:31] You have a need, you come with it to
[2:36:34] church in prayer praying, oh God, may
[2:36:38] you provide, may you speak to me through
[2:36:40] the so everything, you can't even move
[2:36:43] out because you don't want to miss
[2:36:45] anything.
[2:36:47] But this business of people going out,
[2:36:49] this one coming in
[2:36:51] shows there is no deep calling,
[2:36:55] it shows you're just pulling and
[2:36:56] pushing.
[2:36:58] It's like taking a child who is sick
[2:37:01] and you're forcing them to eat.
[2:37:04] Food will just, you know, litter all
[2:37:06] over the floor.
[2:37:08] Get a spoon and fast them. Eat it.
[2:37:15] Eat it.
[2:37:17] It comes in the nose. It comes in the
[2:37:18] back. It goes all over you.
[2:37:22] &gt;&gt; That's a kind of a service
[2:37:25] where you feel that there is a kind of
[2:37:26] hardiness
[2:37:29] in the people. It's like the word is
[2:37:32] coming but it cannot penetrate.
[2:37:36] Why? Because you have not prayed out.
[2:37:39] You are not expectant.
[2:37:42] It's not a pastor that makes a service.
[2:37:45] It is all of us together
[2:37:48] that bring the presence of God.
[2:37:51] I tell you, we have to grow up.
[2:37:54] We as a congregation here at Divia, we
[2:37:57] have to grow up. You know, we have to
[2:38:00] stop this business of coming late.
[2:38:03] Just run a church and then you come and
[2:38:06] sing. You're like yawning and and then
[2:38:10] you go out and the pastors begin to
[2:38:12] preach. You will go out three four
[2:38:15] times.
[2:38:17] If you don't have a deep calling, don't
[2:38:19] come.
[2:38:22] Brother, preach to 10 people
[2:38:25] and the presence of God will come.
[2:38:28] I'm telling you, that's what we need.
[2:38:31] That's what the bride needs in this
[2:38:33] world.
[2:38:35] The people that are hungering
[2:38:37] for God, hungering for the word in
[2:38:41] prayer before they come.
[2:38:43] early pray.
[2:38:45] But if you're not here, the song leader
[2:38:48] will come on the platform
[2:38:50] and he will be singing with chairs.
[2:38:55] You think that God will move in your
[2:38:56] heart after the song leader.
[2:39:02] The song leader doesn't come to take
[2:39:05] time
[2:39:08] as we wait for the preacher.
[2:39:11] This is a pastoral sermon this morning.
[2:39:15] A song leader
[2:39:17] comes to help prepare our hearts
[2:39:22] for the word to come.
[2:39:26] If there is a deep in us,
[2:39:29] you know God will surely come through
[2:39:32] the preacher
[2:39:34] and he will speak exactly what your need
[2:39:37] was.
[2:39:40] And I can tell you, we can see the lamb
[2:39:42] walking,
[2:39:44] the blind seeing.
[2:39:47] We can see miracles happening.
[2:39:51] And we have seen it before in this
[2:39:52] church.
[2:39:54] Several times. Why? Because people were
[2:39:57] expectant.
[2:40:00] In the youth comes when we go,
[2:40:03] people come and they expect
[2:40:05] God is going to do something. And indeed
[2:40:08] God does things.
[2:40:10] But you see if you come halfhazardly
[2:40:14] just to go just to be
[2:40:17] you are coming to be a stumbling block.
[2:40:21] May God help you.
[2:40:24] May God help each of us that brother.
[2:40:27] You will grow up
[2:40:29] sister. You will grow up.
[2:40:31] You will be a conductor
[2:40:35] of of the anointing.
[2:40:39] Amen. That when you come, you not come.
[2:40:42] Oh, I didn't sleep last night.
[2:40:45] I didn't sleep well. So, God
[2:40:47] understands.
[2:40:48] Why didn't you sleep well? The Bible
[2:40:51] says God gives his beloved sleep.
[2:40:56] You know you have service Sunday
[2:40:57] morning.
[2:40:58] If you know you have a flight
[2:41:01] or you have an appointment for a job
[2:41:04] application,
[2:41:08] At 8:00 a.m. in the morning,
[2:41:11] what time do you sleep?
[2:41:16] Answer me, church.
[2:41:23] Answer me. You sleep past midnight.
[2:41:29] You sleep early.
[2:41:33] Let me sleep early. So I wake up early.
[2:41:36] I don't want to miss that interview.
[2:41:40] There are very few people who miss
[2:41:41] flights.
[2:41:45] There are few who miss flight
[2:41:48] because they prepare.
[2:41:51] They prepare early. They do everything
[2:41:53] early. But you find them rushing at the
[2:41:56] end. They are rushing but they have
[2:41:58] three hours before the fight.
[2:42:02] But because they know there's a
[2:42:04] procedure, I have to be checked. My card
[2:42:06] bags have to be checked. I have to check
[2:42:08] in my do this. I have to pass and
[2:42:11] everything.
[2:42:13] But for us, we we are preparing to come
[2:42:15] Sunday morning.
[2:42:18] So the living God,
[2:42:20] can minister to our needs
[2:42:23] and we decide to sleep 3:00 a.m. in the
[2:42:25] night
[2:42:28] and you wake up too late, too tired.
[2:42:32] And then I will I even go to church
[2:42:34] today.
[2:42:37] Let me try anyway.
[2:42:40] What will they say? Maybe I'm preaching
[2:42:42] about you
[2:42:46] and then you come yawning.
[2:42:49] Well, you you shower also
[2:42:52] because you don't want people to say
[2:42:53] anyway, you come dress up
[2:42:56] then you come. But you come yawning
[2:43:00] and you arrive here. You're yawning. You
[2:43:03] sit in the chair. The song say, "Let us
[2:43:06] lift up our hands."
[2:43:12] But song leader, God understand, let let
[2:43:14] me and as soon as the preacher begins,
[2:43:18] it's like a la for you.
[2:43:24] Amen. Amen. When a deacon wakes you up,
[2:43:28] I was not sleeping.
[2:43:31] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, we need to change. We
[2:43:32] need to grow.
[2:43:34] We need to grow.
[2:43:37] If you have Sunday morning service
[2:43:39] and I have a reason why I'm preaching
[2:43:41] this
[2:43:43] because as a pastor, I can discern the
[2:43:45] spiritual climate
[2:43:48] of the people. I know the difference
[2:43:52] between Wednesday services here
[2:43:54] and morning services on Sunday.
[2:43:58] for the past few services.
[2:44:02] You are not expectant.
[2:44:07] You come here,
[2:44:10] not ready.
[2:44:12] If you are not ready,
[2:44:14] then you will not hear from him.
[2:44:18] But if you come pray,
[2:44:20] you come ready to hear from God. You
[2:44:23] come and sit and be in prayer and wait
[2:44:25] upon God. And physicians also you're
[2:44:27] serious
[2:44:30] these days. They're running up and
[2:44:32] running.
[2:44:34] We don't even pray. Begin to pray.
[2:44:39] There's no anointing.
[2:44:42] You're flowing in the flesh
[2:44:44] and you're bringing it as a blanket of
[2:44:46] anointing.
[2:44:48] Let me tell you, we need to change
[2:44:51] because this place here is a hospital
[2:44:55] for God to deliver the sick and the
[2:44:56] bound.
[2:44:59] But we need to create the atmosphere for
[2:45:02] real,
[2:45:04] the atmosphere for revival,
[2:45:07] the atmosphere for miracles,
[2:45:10] the atmosphere for the supernatural.
[2:45:13] Let us make ourselves ready.
[2:45:16] Come on. Musicians be on time. Be really
[2:45:19] serious.
[2:45:22] By the way, I've always seen these
[2:45:23] people out in the Pentecostals.
[2:45:27] Not I'm not here like
[2:45:31] you know these these ones are not
[2:45:34] serious.
[2:45:35] But I'm talking about the serious
[2:45:37] Pentecostals.
[2:45:39] And I'm I'm being sincere with you.
[2:45:42] Amen.
[2:45:43] &gt;&gt; A typical Pentecostal church,
[2:45:49] the full Saturday
[2:45:53] will be rehearsals and preparation.
[2:45:59] Am I saying the truth?
[2:46:01] Rehearsals and preparation.
[2:46:05] The prayer team is in their section.
[2:46:10] They don't need to be told to pray.
[2:46:14] They have a burden to pray for the
[2:46:16] service, to pray for the pastor, pray
[2:46:18] for the, you know, the musicians and
[2:46:19] everybody. And then the musicians,
[2:46:23] they know it as a duty,
[2:46:27] they come, they are practicing
[2:46:30] the whole day, morning to evening. Those
[2:46:34] who work, they come in the afternoon.
[2:46:38] And then
[2:46:39] The those who want to sing special
[2:46:41] songs,
[2:46:43] they also come that same
[2:46:46] and practice.
[2:46:48] But here when they said no one should
[2:46:51] sing
[2:46:53] unless they have practiced
[2:46:56] special songs reduced.
[2:47:01] What is the indication?
[2:47:03] You are singing for a show
[2:47:06] not as a minister.
[2:47:10] I'm going to be real with you today.
[2:47:14] Every sermon you see me preaching.
[2:47:18] I prepare.
[2:47:20] I don't just speak a scripture, let me
[2:47:23] read for them this way. I wait upon God.
[2:47:27] I wait. I pray. I read. I study.
[2:47:31] Sometimes hours and days.
[2:47:34] and sometimes even the whole night and
[2:47:37] come here when I've not slept the whole
[2:47:38] night.
[2:47:40] Not because I wanted to, I didn't,
[2:47:44] but because I felt like consecrating
[2:47:45] myself more.
[2:47:49] But you see, it's not the pastor's job
[2:47:51] alone.
[2:47:53] Everyone must wait upon the Lord
[2:47:56] for his ministry.
[2:47:59] The musicians too. Even if you want to
[2:48:01] sing a special song,
[2:48:04] now I pay money on Sunday, I pay money
[2:48:06] on on Saturday to go. No, no, I I will
[2:48:08] not sing.
[2:48:12] It is ministry.
[2:48:14] If God has given you a voice to sing,
[2:48:17] come on Saturday,
[2:48:19] practice your song, sing it, make sure
[2:48:23] it is well.
[2:48:25] Then you come on Sunday morning
[2:48:28] prayed up ready to minister.
[2:48:33] A special song is not just a song.
[2:48:37] It's a ministry.
[2:48:40] You are ministering to the saint. The
[2:48:43] Bible says someone has a sound.
[2:48:45] Someone has a a dream or someone has
[2:48:48] prophecy or someone has this or someone
[2:48:50] has an expectation. We bring it to be
[2:48:53] able to edify the
[2:48:57] Amen.
[2:48:59] &gt;&gt; Those who are growing are growing.
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; So before there was a creation,
[2:49:08] before you were born,
[2:49:10] there was a call
[2:49:13] from God's deep for you.
[2:49:16] That's why you could never rest in sin
[2:49:19] in the world.
[2:49:22] That's why you turned away from the
[2:49:24] world.
[2:49:26] Something from eternity began calling
[2:49:28] you home.
[2:49:31] Why am I here? I'm I'm not here because
[2:49:34] I I just wanted to.
[2:49:37] I was here because the father drew me.
[2:49:41] The Bible says as we read before, no one
[2:49:43] can come to the father unless he draws
[2:49:45] you.
[2:49:47] Draws you. Draws you. Rosie, rose. I
[2:49:53] remember brother Baka when he first came
[2:49:55] to church.
[2:49:57] I mean, you know, never been even these
[2:49:59] other churches,
[2:50:02] but somehow when he came the first time,
[2:50:04] there was a deep already calling.
[2:50:08] The deep in you was just responding to
[2:50:10] the call.
[2:50:13] Let me tell you, each of you is here
[2:50:15] because you're responding to the calling
[2:50:17] of the father. Hallelujah.
[2:50:23] If there is a a deep calling in you for
[2:50:25] healing,
[2:50:28] if you are sick, there is another deep
[2:50:30] response.
[2:50:33] You cannot be healed.
[2:50:35] Unless you have expectation for healing,
[2:50:42] but you see there has to be healing
[2:50:43] somewhere.
[2:50:46] If you hunger for more of God,
[2:50:50] There is bound to be more of God to
[2:50:52] respond to it somewhere.
[2:50:58] If you've only been justified by faith
[2:51:00] and know nothing about the baptism of
[2:51:02] the Holy Ghost
[2:51:06] and you hunger for the Holy Spirit,
[2:51:09] there's got to be a Holy Ghost somewhere
[2:51:11] to fill that hunger.
[2:51:16] Listen, the problem we have these days
[2:51:18] People
[2:51:19] know I don't have the Holy Spirit
[2:51:23] and they don't hunger for him.
[2:51:28] Let me tell you, you will never receive
[2:51:29] him.
[2:51:32] You have to hunger
[2:51:34] and hunger until you find.
[2:51:38] It's like someone saying, "I'm hungering
[2:51:40] for water,
[2:51:42] but because all I've got is porridge, is
[2:51:46] some soda, some this, some that
[2:51:53] I feel water doesn't exist,
[2:51:58] that person will die
[2:52:01] and he will never get water because he
[2:52:03] has given up too early, too soon.
[2:52:06] If you need the Holy Spirit,
[2:52:09] I'm talking about you who needs the
[2:52:11] baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[2:52:15] God still fills people with the baptism.
[2:52:19] Because you see, that's the power to
[2:52:22] overcome the world.
[2:52:25] If you feel that your addiction is
[2:52:27] stronger than than you,
[2:52:31] it means you don't have the baptism of
[2:52:33] the Holy Spirit.
[2:52:35] The devil is trying to bring addictions
[2:52:37] and these other things you
[2:52:40] so don't give up and say, "I prayed. I
[2:52:44] prayed. I fasted but I didn't find." Why
[2:52:48] did you pray and fast? Because there was
[2:52:50] a hunger in you. And because there is a
[2:52:53] hunger in you, there is a Holy Ghost
[2:52:55] somewhere to fill your heart and change
[2:52:59] you.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you believe you are you you are
[2:53:04] hungering for a change,
[2:53:08] I tell you don't give up. Keep
[2:53:10] searching, keep seeking, keep desiring
[2:53:12] pain.
[2:53:15] God will fill you. And if you believe
[2:53:18] today that there is a God who heals,
[2:53:22] there's got to be a fountain open
[2:53:24] somewhere
[2:53:26] for healing.
[2:53:29] Oh, that desire wouldn't be there.
[2:53:34] Amen. I just remembered Sister Diana
[2:53:36] right here.
[2:53:38] I think they might be online streaming
[2:53:39] this.
[2:53:41] You see, sister Diana has believed
[2:53:44] that God will open her eyes
[2:53:48] because you see, you have to understand
[2:53:51] that this is a sister who did not who
[2:53:53] had lost a sense of feeling.
[2:53:57] She had lost the sense of uh of smell.
[2:54:01] She had lost hearing.
[2:54:03] She had lost all the five senses.
[2:54:06] But you see, she believed together with
[2:54:09] her mother, sister, mother that God
[2:54:11] would heal her. And you know, God began
[2:54:13] restoring one by one by one by one.
[2:54:19] And now what is remaining is the eyes.
[2:54:23] And you know what they've told her? It
[2:54:26] is impossible for her to see again
[2:54:29] unless it is a miracle. But she believes
[2:54:31] she will see again. And here is I have a
[2:54:34] message for you sister. If you believe
[2:54:36] there is healing for you somewhere
[2:54:40] and you have that hunger and ask for it.
[2:54:44] Don't let anything put down your faith.
[2:54:49] Hunger alone.
[2:54:52] So there's a brand new eyes for you.
[2:54:55] Amen.
[2:54:57] Hallelujah.
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; Whatever you hung for
[2:55:00] sure it is somewhere.
[2:55:03] The brother was hungering and looking
[2:55:04] for a wife.
[2:55:07] Going here, meeting this one, meeting
[2:55:08] that one, going to his church. One time
[2:55:11] I called him. And I said, "Brother,
[2:55:15] stop moving around.
[2:55:17] Stay put."
[2:55:19] Said, "I'm looking. I'm looking. I'm
[2:55:20] looking." And that's how many of us are.
[2:55:23] We don't stay in God's provided place of
[2:55:27] worship.
[2:55:29] We are going here. We are going there.
[2:55:30] We are going. We are going there.
[2:55:32] &gt;&gt; But what is making you look for help?
[2:55:36] Because you have a deep calling within.
[2:55:40] You feel there is a something.
[2:55:44] Amen. And the brother said I found her
[2:55:46] in the youth meeting
[2:55:50] right in your church. God brought her to
[2:55:53] you.
[2:55:55] Hallelujah. If you are in the will of
[2:55:57] God, brother,
[2:56:00] stay in the word. Stay in the word.
[2:56:03] Don't let anything take you out.
[2:56:06] Because if there is a deep calling with
[2:56:08] you, there is a deep somewhere
[2:56:12] to respond to that thing.
[2:56:15] Hallelujah. Amen. the way of God
[2:56:17] providing you with something
[2:56:21] and giving you a desire for it.
[2:56:27] And if you have a hunger and a desire to
[2:56:32] receive the Holy Ghost, it means God has
[2:56:35] already given you the Holy Ghost.
[2:56:38] Now just keep hungering. Keep trusting.
[2:56:42] You shall find. You shall be filled. The
[2:56:46] Bible says, "Amen, blessed are they that
[2:56:49] hunger and thirst
[2:56:51] after righteousness,
[2:56:53] they shall be filled."
[2:56:58] Hallelujah.
[2:57:00] Yes, sir. God can never lie.
[2:57:03] In other words, like this before there
[2:57:06] was a creation,
[2:57:08] there had to be a creator to build that
[2:57:10] creation.
[2:57:12] Let me go up a little bit. And if you
[2:57:15] believe today there is a God who heals,
[2:57:18] there's got to be a fountain open
[2:57:20] somewhere for you
[2:57:23] or that desire wouldn't be there.
[2:57:29] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. If
[2:57:32] you desire God to heal you,
[2:57:35] some of those sicknesses that you get
[2:57:37] and you believe God can heal, I believe
[2:57:40] God can heal you. Then if you have that
[2:57:43] faith, brother,
[2:57:44] If you have a desire for divine healing,
[2:57:48] don't let anything talk you out of it.
[2:57:54] Our God opens the blinded eye.
[2:57:58] He heals HIV.
[2:58:01] By the way, he does these things. There
[2:58:04] are many, too many with testimonies.
[2:58:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I've witnessed personally
[2:58:11] God healing a man who was almost dead
[2:58:17] and God delivered him and healed him
[2:58:19] from tuberculosis
[2:58:22] and raised him up and until today is
[2:58:26] testifying of the grace of God.
[2:58:29] Amen. I prayed for the demon possessed
[2:58:33] and you know people who people thought
[2:58:36] they would never be delivered.
[2:58:38] Someone demonp possessed
[2:58:40] you know those stubborn demons.
[2:58:43] Brother Martin, where are you? He's
[2:58:45] dealt with them sometimes. He knows what
[2:58:47] I'm talking about. Very stubborn demon
[2:58:51] on a few occasions here and there.
[2:58:54] Several occasion we've cast out those
[2:58:56] demons. But you see one thing with it.
[2:59:00] If there is a desire
[2:59:04] for someone to be delivered from those
[2:59:06] kind of demon oppression,
[2:59:11] it means there is something that can
[2:59:15] deliver them.
[2:59:17] You remember that man who was lying on
[2:59:19] the pallet
[2:59:21] for 38 years.
[2:59:24] 38 years. Lying on the pallet.
[2:59:28] and and and you know when he saw Jesus
[2:59:31] of course Jesus passed I don't have
[2:59:34] anybody I can run others have run
[2:59:39] but you know what Jesus told him stand
[2:59:42] up on your feet carry your bed and walk
[2:59:47] 38 years
[2:59:51] delay is not denial
[2:59:56] 38 years.
[3:00:00] This man
[3:00:02] he stayed there.
[3:00:04] But the problem with us, we want
[3:00:07] something rush quick fast.
[3:00:11] God wants you to exercise faith
[3:00:15] and faith is unmovable.
[3:00:18] When things are happening in the wrong
[3:00:20] way, you stay there. Stay in the word.
[3:00:24] Stay at your place of you. You are a
[3:00:26] wife. Things are not going well. Stay in
[3:00:29] your home. Amen. A man, stay with your
[3:00:32] responsibility
[3:00:34] and keep believing, keep praying, if
[3:00:37] there is a desire in you that things
[3:00:40] will go well, then I'm telling you this
[3:00:43] morning, things must go well.
[3:00:47] Desire
[3:00:49] is the way God communicates
[3:00:53] to say I am here to give you what you
[3:00:56] need. I am here to provide. But the
[3:01:00] problem many don't believe long enough.
[3:01:06] When God is about to come through for
[3:01:08] you,
[3:01:10] he doesn't find you in a place where he
[3:01:13] expected you 38 years. Hallelujah.
[3:01:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:01:19] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:01:21] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:01:23] &gt;&gt; He waited first year, second year, third
[3:01:26] year, fourth year, sixth year until the
[3:01:28] Messiah came.
[3:01:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; And the creator is the first before the
[3:01:38] creation.
[3:01:40] And there is a creation in your heart
[3:01:42] here to hunger and thirst for divine
[3:01:44] healing.
[3:01:47] a God that will have mercy on you.
[3:01:50] There's got to be a God somewhere to
[3:01:51] have mercy on you and that creates that
[3:01:53] creation.
[3:01:55] The one who created you. Now that's
[3:01:58] true.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; It is something you are hungry for. Now
[3:02:02] when a deep in you
[3:02:04] meets the deep in God,
[3:02:08] something supernatural happens.
[3:02:12] Amen. A union happens.
[3:02:15] like Isaac and Rebecca,
[3:02:17] &gt;&gt; you know, Isaac, she was uh, you know,
[3:02:18] Rebecca was walking before she even met
[3:02:21] him.
[3:02:24] But when she saw him in a distance,
[3:02:27] something within
[3:02:30] said, "That is him.
[3:02:33] That is Isaac. That's your husband." And
[3:02:37] she asked somebody, "Is that him?" And
[3:02:41] they said, "Yes."
[3:02:43] She quickly recover herself and she ran
[3:02:47] a rider horse or something and she went
[3:02:50] to meet him. Let me tell you the deep
[3:02:54] was calling the deep.
[3:03:00] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me build it for you here.
[3:03:02] Genesis 24:14
[3:03:04] and let it come to pass.
[3:03:07] M
[3:03:07] &gt;&gt; I want to show you how God works
[3:03:10] that this is now the um the man that has
[3:03:13] gone to look for a wife Isaac
[3:03:19] and he prays listen to the prayer and
[3:03:22] let it come to pass that the dams to
[3:03:24] whom I shall say
[3:03:27] let down thy picture
[3:03:30] I pray thee that I may drink and she
[3:03:33] shall say drink please follow me closer
[3:03:38] and I will give thy camels also.
[3:03:44] Let the same be she
[3:03:47] that has that thou hast appointed
[3:03:50] for thy servant Isaac.
[3:03:52] Do you see how how he prayed? Appointed
[3:03:56] here means predestinated
[3:04:00] chosen before Rebecca ever knew Isaac.
[3:04:04] She was appointed
[3:04:07] She was predestinated.
[3:04:09] She was chosen to be the real wife of
[3:04:13] Isaac.
[3:04:16] And God blesses within this man
[3:04:20] to pray a prayer.
[3:04:22] What you would call an impossible
[3:04:24] prayer.
[3:04:27] Amen. Oh my.
[3:04:31] receive what I'm telling you right now
[3:04:34] because I'm now downloading things from
[3:04:36] the divine world.
[3:04:39] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. How
[3:04:41] many are connected here?
[3:04:44] Amen. Yes. Maybe the people begin
[3:04:45] calling you now.
[3:04:48] Here, you know, she wanted to be
[3:04:50] married. She didn't but she could not
[3:04:53] talk to any man.
[3:04:55] It was time for her to get married.
[3:04:58] But I but she was a good woman.
[3:05:01] And now God leads this man
[3:05:05] to pray a prayer
[3:05:08] that is according to the heart and life
[3:05:10] of this woman.
[3:05:15] The deep calling unto the deep.
[3:05:18] This woman was naturally kind.
[3:05:22] She was a good woman. She was raised
[3:05:25] well.
[3:05:26] Not any woman can do what she did.
[3:05:30] These camels were so many
[3:05:34] going back and forth. I don't know how
[3:05:35] many times
[3:05:37] to look for water to feed these camels.
[3:05:41] But you see as soon as she came, the
[3:05:44] Bible says before he even finished
[3:05:46] praying,
[3:05:48] this woman came and and and you know he
[3:05:51] said, "Oh yeah, water." Said, "Oh, sure.
[3:05:55] I I will also get for the
[3:05:58] who put that in.
[3:06:03] It was the prayer
[3:06:06] prayed
[3:06:08] when Rebecca was not there.
[3:06:11] But now Rebecca had she had a desire
[3:06:18] to be helpful,
[3:06:20] to be kind. But that same desire
[3:06:25] was the deep responding to the deep.
[3:06:30] That desire in her was what God blessed
[3:06:33] in her
[3:06:36] to help
[3:06:38] so she can be able to get a husband.
[3:06:41] Hallelujah. Amen. That's how God works.
[3:06:44] He tells Elijah, "Go, I've commanded a
[3:06:48] woman to feed you."
[3:06:53] Sister Rose, how was that woman
[3:06:55] commanded?
[3:06:58] How was that woman commanded?
[3:07:01] Did God command her? Of course, we know
[3:07:04] when Elijah arrived, this woman did not
[3:07:07] know anything.
[3:07:11] Did she know? Because the prophet said,
[3:07:14] "Give me to drink." She was going to
[3:07:16] bring and then he said, "Bring me also
[3:07:19] something to eat."
[3:07:20] She said, "No, man of God. You have
[3:07:24] asked for too much.
[3:07:26] What I have is for me and my son and
[3:07:29] then we shall die." But you know,
[3:07:32] because God had commanded her. How does
[3:07:35] God command?
[3:07:37] God convicts your heart.
[3:07:40] God moves in your heart.
[3:07:43] You desire
[3:07:46] to do something.
[3:07:48] So now this woman
[3:07:50] who made her heart softer
[3:07:53] to surrender everything she had knowing
[3:07:56] she would die. It was God.
[3:07:59] It was God. You who has done things that
[3:08:02] you never even knew why you were doing
[3:08:03] them.
[3:08:06] For the work of God, brother, always be
[3:08:08] in obedience.
[3:08:12] Be in obedience.
[3:08:14] Be in obedience.
[3:08:16] Be in obedience. God can move on your
[3:08:19] heart
[3:08:20] and say, "You know what? That brother
[3:08:22] doesn't have shoes. Buy him brand new."
[3:08:26] You be like, "Ah, huh."
[3:08:28] &gt;&gt; But you see that desire you have, it's
[3:08:31] not you. It is God moving.
[3:08:34] If you don't do it, you have disobeyed.
[3:08:40] You heard the pastor talking about
[3:08:42] whatever machines. You need millions of
[3:08:45] money. Well, I have 2 millions on my
[3:08:48] account. It is my saving and God has
[3:08:52] told me you you are now going to give
[3:08:54] all of it.
[3:08:57] Of course, that was a thought.
[3:09:00] It was not God. It was me.
[3:09:02] It has happened here before
[3:09:05] is just right there.
[3:09:07] She had a small savings.
[3:09:09] When we starting to collect land fund
[3:09:11] many years ago,
[3:09:13] she gave all of it.
[3:09:16] She came to me and she was saying,
[3:09:18] "Pastor, this is God. I'm going to give
[3:09:21] all of you." I said, "Sometimes as a
[3:09:24] pastor, you feel bad for
[3:09:27] sister. Are you sure?"
[3:09:29] Yeah. God has moved on my heart to do
[3:09:31] it.
[3:09:33] All right. If it is God
[3:09:37] and you know what she got, I think
[3:09:39] triple. Is it triple or four times?
[3:09:44] God speaks to you by desire.
[3:09:52] And that woman, that widow desired, he
[3:09:55] said, "Okay, I'll do it." That was God
[3:09:58] commanded.
[3:10:00] Many people have done things for you
[3:10:02] when they didn't even know why. It was
[3:10:05] God who had commanded
[3:10:08] to do it for you. Amen. So, she was
[3:10:11] chosen before. Amen. Genesis 24:57 and
[3:10:16] they said we will call the dam.
[3:10:20] &gt;&gt; This is after everything.
[3:10:22] Now the he wants to marry her.
[3:10:26] And the parents are saying we will call
[3:10:28] the dam and inquire at her mouth and
[3:10:32] they called Rebecca. And they said unto
[3:10:34] Rebecca, will you go with this man?
[3:10:38] And she say I will go.
[3:10:45] When they when you know when they called
[3:10:47] her name
[3:10:50] something inside her responded
[3:10:54] she recognized her place
[3:10:58] in the promised.
[3:11:01] Oh hallelujah. Remember the calling was
[3:11:04] upon Abraham and his city.
[3:11:08] But you see, Rebecca had a place in
[3:11:11] that.
[3:11:14] She had to be God knew before the
[3:11:15] foundation of the world.
[3:11:17] She had to be the wife of Isaac.
[3:11:21] And here she was. Will you go? He said,
[3:11:25] "I will go." That's why marriage is not
[3:11:28] by force.
[3:11:30] It has to be the deep calling into the
[3:11:32] deep.
[3:11:34] Stop saying, "I'm waiting for a dream.
[3:11:36] I'm waiting for this. I'm waiting for
[3:11:38] that. The deep calling unto the deep.
[3:11:43] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you who are looking for
[3:11:47] marriage, whatever you desire, God is
[3:11:51] going to give it to you. Now remember I
[3:11:53] said whatever you desire.
[3:11:57] Your husband is exactly the way you want
[3:12:00] him.
[3:12:04] Your wife is exactly the way you want
[3:12:07] her.
[3:12:10] Brother Grace, are you getting my point?
[3:12:13] Exactly the way you want her.
[3:12:16] But you see, many of us settle for less.
[3:12:23] That's the mistake. And then later he
[3:12:25] begins. I wish I knew.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; I really dropped a step.
[3:12:33] Don't settle for less.
[3:12:38] Your desire is the way God communicates
[3:12:41] to you.
[3:12:45] She said, "I'll go." And Rebecca lifted
[3:12:47] up her eyes. When she saw Isa, she
[3:12:51] lighted off the camel.
[3:12:54] Therefore, she took a veil.
[3:12:57] and later uncovered herself. When she
[3:13:00] saw him, there was an inner witness.
[3:13:03] She knew him by revelation.
[3:13:07] Not introduction.
[3:13:09] Revelation.
[3:13:11] Not introduction.
[3:13:13] I don't believe in matchmaking.
[3:13:18] That's not the way of God.
[3:13:20] Don't marry someone else because you've
[3:13:22] been introduced.
[3:13:25] Make sure it's a revelation. She's the
[3:13:28] one. He's the one. Then it's an there is
[3:13:31] an inner witness in you.
[3:13:34] That's the deep calling to the deep.
[3:13:37] In the same way, spiritually speaking,
[3:13:40] the bride of Christ today, when she
[3:13:42] hears the voice of the bridegroom
[3:13:46] through the revealed word of God,
[3:13:49] something cries out,
[3:13:51] "This is what I need.
[3:13:54] This is what I believe.
[3:13:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:00] &gt;&gt; My sister here was telling me
[3:14:02] they were dying in the denomination.
[3:14:05] &gt;&gt; Why? Why? How did she answer that or
[3:14:08] rather what was she answering? When she
[3:14:11] asked me, "Who is brother?" I always get
[3:14:14] to talking about him.
[3:14:16] And then I began explaining to her who
[3:14:18] brother is being the messenger of our
[3:14:20] generation and how he has led us back
[3:14:23] again to the apostolic faith and things
[3:14:25] like that.
[3:14:28] You know what others would say? I don't
[3:14:32] want to believe. But because she was an
[3:14:35] ill
[3:14:37] before the foundation of the world, she
[3:14:40] said, I recognize that
[3:14:43] your heart cries out.
[3:14:46] That's what I want. That's the deep
[3:14:48] calling to the deep.
[3:14:50] The word recognizing the word
[3:14:55] recognizing
[3:15:00] You see, Paul connects this same mystery
[3:15:01] to the bride of Christ.
[3:15:04] When he says, "For whom he did for one
[3:15:06] know, he also did predestin
[3:15:09] according as he has chosen us in him
[3:15:11] before the foundation of the world.
[3:15:14] My sheep hear my voice
[3:15:16] and I know them and they follow me." You
[3:15:20] see the bride like the bride of Christ
[3:15:22] like Rebecca
[3:15:24] like Rebecca there was chosen before
[3:15:29] they met him.
[3:15:32] Give us that that chorus.
[3:15:36] We used to sing it many years ago. It
[3:15:38] says victory sing with me in Jesus
[3:15:42] my savior
[3:15:44] forever.
[3:15:45] He sold me
[3:15:49] with his redeeming blood. He said, "You
[3:15:52] are not singing. He loved me
[3:15:57] and all my love.
[3:16:00] He plunged me to victory
[3:16:05] the
[3:16:08] he loved me." that that what there is
[3:16:11] before I knew him
[3:16:14] and all my life
[3:16:16] is due him. He planned me to victory
[3:16:21] beneath the blazing. Give me the next
[3:16:25] listen. I had a no. Give me give me give
[3:16:28] me the the next stanza. All right. I
[3:16:30] heard about his healing
[3:16:33] of his cleansing power revealed,
[3:16:37] how he made the lamb to walk again and
[3:16:40] cause the blind to see.
[3:16:44] And then I cried, "Dear Jesus,
[3:16:48] come and heal my broken."
[3:16:51] And somehow Jesus came and brought to me
[3:16:56] the victory.
[3:16:59] You see friends, we were fornown,
[3:17:02] predestinated and called.
[3:17:05] But you see when the word Christ is
[3:17:07] revealed in your day,
[3:17:09] something within you responds
[3:17:12] recognizing that word.
[3:17:16] Every true call
[3:17:19] will always be answered.
[3:17:22] A baby cries, there must be milk
[3:17:24] somewhere.
[3:17:27] A fish has fins
[3:17:31] that there must be water somewhere.
[3:17:35] A bird has wings. There must be air to
[3:17:37] fly in.
[3:17:40] There is something in you crying for
[3:17:41] God.
[3:17:43] There is a Holy Ghost somewhere
[3:17:46] to satisfy that cry. That's why the
[3:17:49] message of the hour comes
[3:17:51] not to give us a new religion or a new
[3:17:54] theology.
[3:17:56] By the way, let me tell you this message
[3:17:58] is here to satisfy
[3:18:02] the deep cry in our heart.
[3:18:06] We are crying out for the original word,
[3:18:08] the truth,
[3:18:11] the same life that was in Jesus.
[3:18:15] And then when we hear it,
[3:18:17] &gt;&gt; we say amen. Amen.
[3:18:21] &gt;&gt; You know, I was an Anglican boy
[3:18:24] and I was a very dedicated one.
[3:18:27] But I had too many questions.
[3:18:30] And my priests could not answer them.
[3:18:34] If you ask them too much,
[3:18:36] they tell you you don't have to ask too
[3:18:39] much.
[3:18:41] Just believe.
[3:18:44] But my heart was still punching
[3:18:48] for more for more. And then I met this
[3:18:52] truth.
[3:18:54] Oh, it answered every one of my prayers.
[3:18:59] Hallelujah.
[3:19:00] Let me tell you, it put me on fire.
[3:19:04] And I started telling everybody about
[3:19:05] it. If you are on fire, you are going to
[3:19:09] witness to other people
[3:19:12] about this message. I be I I got on
[3:19:15] fire, put up a website and started
[3:19:18] telling everybody and whoever I meet
[3:19:20] even when I go to the banks wherever I
[3:19:22] go.
[3:19:24] I remember there was one time I was in
[3:19:26] Nairobi and I I I had this usually
[3:19:29] walked with my tracks
[3:19:32] but I don't know whether you're printing
[3:19:33] those these days. I know and we were I
[3:19:36] was with those trucks
[3:19:38] and I usually leave it wherever I go.
[3:19:41] So when I was in this went to a bank
[3:19:43] with a brother
[3:19:45] and I was we were waiting somewhere and
[3:19:47] I gave to the teller and some other
[3:19:49] person
[3:19:52] read this meanwhile
[3:19:56] and this brother told me this I've never
[3:19:58] seen it this way but it's a good idea by
[3:20:01] the way of outreach.
[3:20:05] Do you know you can do outreach
[3:20:07] everywhere and anywhere?
[3:20:11] everywhere and everywhere.
[3:20:14] Every person you see is a potential
[3:20:16] believer.
[3:20:19] Give them the message.
[3:20:21] Take some tracks. Come to brother M.
[3:20:24] You'll give it to them. Take some books
[3:20:27] and give it to them.
[3:20:30] Don't worry about who will believe, who
[3:20:32] will not.
[3:20:34] There is a deep calling
[3:20:37] in them. this message will respond.
[3:20:43] Praise God. I believe when I was coming
[3:20:45] from the other church, I was online and
[3:20:47] I saw brother Okai online
[3:20:53] just about 100 kilometers from the Red
[3:20:54] Sea
[3:20:57] in northern Ethiopia. You see this is a
[3:21:00] he was an elder in one of the churches,
[3:21:03] the denominations. I have never seen the
[3:21:06] message truth strike somebody like it
[3:21:08] did him.
[3:21:13] He read the church age book and finished
[3:21:14] it and he called me to come and discuss
[3:21:17] it. So I traveled there. It's 2 hours
[3:21:20] flight from Addis 1 hour and a half. So
[3:21:23] I arrived there and we in this hotel
[3:21:26] room and we begin sharing with him. I
[3:21:29] was with another brother and friends
[3:21:33] this is beyond what a man can do.
[3:21:36] This was God. The deep was responding to
[3:21:39] me.
[3:21:40] And he looked down and shaking voice and
[3:21:45] he spoke his words. He said this is the
[3:21:47] truth.
[3:21:50] I have believed it and I would like
[3:21:56] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:22:00] Christ
[3:22:01] 50 something years old
[3:22:06] and we baptized him. But I tell you
[3:22:08] what, God has used that brother and his
[3:22:12] son to now translate this message
[3:22:16] into the local language of that region.
[3:22:20] You think it was me who brought you to
[3:22:21] the Lord? No. No one brings anyone to
[3:22:25] the Lord.
[3:22:26] It is a deep in them responding.
[3:22:29] Hallelujah.
[3:22:32] &gt;&gt; Why are you here? Because the deep in
[3:22:34] you responding.
[3:22:37] That's why I say hallelujah. I cannot
[3:22:39] back.
[3:22:42] I cannot fall. I cannot be destroyed.
[3:22:46] The devil cannot manage me because I
[3:22:49] came here responding to something.
[3:22:54] I was responding to the deep in God.
[3:22:57] So I am here to stay.
[3:23:00] The devil might as well get used to me
[3:23:06] loving my Jesus because listen I cannot
[3:23:09] fall away.
[3:23:13] I would have finished but give me a few
[3:23:15] more minutes. It is raining. So listen,
[3:23:18] I cannot fall away.
[3:23:21] There is something we need to
[3:23:21] understand. He said all that you have
[3:23:24] given me are in my hands. None of them
[3:23:28] can be lost.
[3:23:30] So there is eternal security.
[3:23:39] You can never fall away.
[3:23:41] Let me tell you a few things that cannot
[3:23:43] happen to you. Let me tell you a few
[3:23:45] things which cannot happen to you. You
[3:23:48] cannot fall away.
[3:23:50] &gt;&gt; You cannot go to hell.
[3:23:53] You cannot be destroyed by your trial or
[3:23:54] temptation. Hallelujah.
[3:23:58] You are indestructible.
[3:24:02] You are supernatural.
[3:24:05] You are divine.
[3:24:08] Why? Because you were in the mind of God
[3:24:10] before
[3:24:12] but you were lost here in time.
[3:24:15] But the word came and called you. How
[3:24:19] did you respond when you had a deep
[3:24:22] within you?
[3:24:24] By the time the word came or you had a
[3:24:27] desire in you said
[3:24:32] that's how it was.
[3:24:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:24:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the devil was giving you other
[3:24:38] things to satisfy
[3:24:40] the thirst you had
[3:24:42] but one by one you begin throwing them
[3:24:46] away
[3:24:47] alcohol
[3:24:49] doesn't satisfy
[3:24:53] cigarettes
[3:24:56] women adultery fornication men doesn't
[3:25:00] satisfy
[3:25:02] did you throw away
[3:25:04] my appreciation to people who threw Hey.
[3:25:09] Hallelujah. Witchcraft. Some of you we
[3:25:12] are doing witchcraft.
[3:25:15] You remember? You remember you say it
[3:25:17] doesn't satisfy
[3:25:20] one by one. Last doesn't satisfy. You
[3:25:24] threw away. You threw away. You threw
[3:25:27] away. And since then you have been
[3:25:30] drinking from a real fountain.
[3:25:35] And the devil thinks that you will not
[3:25:38] be changed.
[3:25:39] But it's too late now.
[3:25:42] You already changing.
[3:25:44] Even if you can't see it, it is
[3:25:47] happening inside.
[3:25:49] And on the inside, it's going to be
[3:25:52] manifest on the outside.
[3:25:55] Soon and very soon, we are going to walk
[3:25:57] into our
[3:26:00] will know as we are known.
[3:26:04] as we are known.
[3:26:09] &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. Amen.
[3:26:10] &gt;&gt; When we get over there, then we can look
[3:26:13] at one another. You made it. I made it.
[3:26:16] You made it. You made it. You made it.
[3:26:19] No more worries, no more fears, no more
[3:26:23] sickness, no more temptation.
[3:26:26] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:26:27] &gt;&gt; We would have overcome.
[3:26:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:26:31] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I believe brother Sad and
[3:26:33] brother
[3:26:35] are saying pastor wait for that part.
[3:26:42] We want our wedding before the rapture.
[3:26:47] But I tell you brothers, that one is
[3:26:50] better than anything else.
[3:26:55] Hallelujah. When we get over there, we
[3:26:59] will not need anything
[3:27:01] because we shall have received
[3:27:03] everything.
[3:27:05] Jesus is everything.
[3:27:08] &gt;&gt; The word is everything.
[3:27:11] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:27:13] &gt;&gt; All right. Let me try to conclude now.
[3:27:16] You see that's why now I want to show
[3:27:17] you here in Isaiah 65.
[3:27:21] And it shall come to pass
[3:27:23] that before they call
[3:27:26] I will answer
[3:27:30] and while they are yet speaking
[3:27:36] I will hear. This is God speaking.
[3:27:43] Before they call I will answer.
[3:27:47] While they yet speaking,
[3:27:49] I will hear. This is going to happen in
[3:27:51] the millennium.
[3:27:54] But even before then, God blesses a
[3:27:57] desire
[3:27:59] in the elect
[3:28:01] because he has already made provision to
[3:28:04] fulfill it.
[3:28:08] Show that every two spiritual hunger
[3:28:12] is evidence a divine answer is already
[3:28:15] existing.
[3:28:21] When God begins to deal with a soul
[3:28:24] deeply,
[3:28:27] worldly ambition is fed.
[3:28:31] You begin to hunger for prayer.
[3:28:33] You begin to hunger for the word and
[3:28:36] fellowship with God.
[3:28:39] That's why revival doesn't start in the
[3:28:40] crowd.
[3:28:43] It begins in the deep places of the
[3:28:46] heart.
[3:28:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Men desiring God,
[3:28:52] hungering for God, wanting to see a
[3:28:55] revival, wanting to see miracles,
[3:28:58] wanting to see things happen
[3:29:01] and then a revival breaks out.
[3:29:06] Amen. You see, in deep into the deep, it
[3:29:09] says when Lutherans had their revival,
[3:29:13] There's a group called Methodist.
[3:29:15] They called for God, the deep calling to
[3:29:17] the deep. God rose up a little old
[3:29:20] fellow over in England by the name of
[3:29:21] John Wiz
[3:29:24] and Whitefield and them. And where they
[3:29:27] went with a message of sanctification.
[3:29:30] They found more grace,
[3:29:34] found more of God.
[3:29:37] They was craving for more.
[3:29:40] When it went on for a while,
[3:29:42] And after a while the method begin to
[3:29:45] organize and get a cold formal
[3:29:51] then people begin to cry more.
[3:29:54] So if you see coldness beginning to
[3:29:56] happen
[3:29:58] there will be someone hungering.
[3:30:03] Never feel like I need to pray for the
[3:30:04] church.
[3:30:07] Don't let others do it. Some people they
[3:30:10] feel it. And they want to first organize
[3:30:12] everybody.
[3:30:16] They want everybody to join.
[3:30:18] Do you know you can come here
[3:30:21] by yourself
[3:30:23] and begin to pray for the church?
[3:30:26] Begin to pray for the family. Begin to
[3:30:28] pray for everyone, for the ministry, for
[3:30:31] the needs. And you know it has happened
[3:30:34] before where you will find several
[3:30:36] people in the church
[3:30:38] and they all coming to pray on a day
[3:30:41] that is not a day of prayer
[3:30:44] just on their own and then when you ask
[3:30:47] they ask each other so they can carry
[3:30:50] each other's burdens
[3:30:52] what's your burdens I'm praying for the
[3:30:54] ministry
[3:30:55] it's the same need that's how revival
[3:30:58] starts till God moves on you as an
[3:31:01] individual
[3:31:03] not as an organization.
[3:31:05] You see they found more of God and you
[3:31:07] know revival started out.
[3:31:10] Then along came Pentecost deep to the
[3:31:13] deep. Now this Pentecostal people begin
[3:31:16] to just get a a a form a spirit ritual
[3:31:19] as the rest of them.
[3:31:25] Before you know it deep
[3:31:29] there came you and me.
[3:31:31] desiring for more than just
[3:31:33] Pentecostalism.
[3:31:36] Desiring for the restoration of the
[3:31:37] world.
[3:31:39] &gt;&gt; What is it? Deep calling to the deep.
[3:31:43] Amen. In this final hour, friends. There
[3:31:46] is a deep in God calling his bride out
[3:31:48] of denominational system,
[3:31:52] out of formality, out of this year, back
[3:31:55] to the original one. And there is a deep
[3:31:58] in the bride
[3:32:00] responding to that call.
[3:32:03] Revelation 18:4
[3:32:05] come out of her people. What is it?
[3:32:08] That's the deep in God calling
[3:32:12] come out of her people.
[3:32:14] But you see Revelation 22:20
[3:32:17] and the bride says even so come Lord
[3:32:22] Jesus.
[3:32:24] What is it? As the deep in the bride
[3:32:26] responding,
[3:32:29] God calling him come out of our people.
[3:32:33] Even so come Lord Jesus.
[3:32:36] When the deep in God calls,
[3:32:38] there's a deep response.
[3:32:41] Hallelujah. Amen. And I finish with Mark
[3:32:44] 11.
[3:32:46] Therefore I say unto you
[3:32:48] what things
[3:32:50] you desire.
[3:32:54] &gt;&gt; Oh people did not hear it by the Lord.
[3:32:58] My my my my hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:33:01] &gt;&gt; Did you receive all your desires Monica?
[3:33:04] Let me tell you whatever else you
[3:33:06] desire.
[3:33:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:33:10] &gt;&gt; Don't just say Sister Alan I'm done.
[3:33:13] I've got married. There is more in God,
[3:33:16] there is more blessings.
[3:33:18] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:33:20] &gt;&gt; God bless you my sister.
[3:33:22] What thingsever you desire.
[3:33:27] &gt;&gt; What do you desire?
[3:33:29] &gt;&gt; What do you desire?
[3:33:31] Do you know the Bible said what? What?
[3:33:34] Let me no more no more language.
[3:33:37] Whatever you desire,
[3:33:40] whatever thing you desire.
[3:33:44] Now, how the desire come? First of all,
[3:33:48] be born again. Be filled with the Holy
[3:33:50] Ghost. Now, I'm talking to those ones.
[3:33:52] Okay? Don't misunderstand me.
[3:33:55] This scripture, this scripture applies
[3:33:58] to the Holy Ghost filled,
[3:34:01] the born again. The ones who are like
[3:34:04] sister
[3:34:08] because remember, God cannot try even to
[3:34:11] ask a person who is not born again to do
[3:34:13] this.
[3:34:18] What if the person says I want them to
[3:34:20] be
[3:34:25] You understand the point? So God will
[3:34:27] tell you if he knows you are
[3:34:30] regenerated.
[3:34:34] Your desire is his desire.
[3:34:38] Now if you're born again when you have a
[3:34:41] desire,
[3:34:43] it is the way of God communicating to
[3:34:45] you
[3:34:47] to tell you that thing is somewhere.
[3:34:52] Hallelujah. Let me emphasize
[3:34:55] if you're born again,
[3:34:57] okay?
[3:34:59] Let's talk to you. Whatever you desire,
[3:35:04] I'm not saying think about something.
[3:35:07] I'm talking about the desire you already
[3:35:09] have.
[3:35:12] Some of you say, "Oh, God,
[3:35:15] all I need is a little job."
[3:35:19] No. Is that your real desire?
[3:35:23] What's your desire?
[3:35:26] If you were sister right now and God
[3:35:29] asked you, ask what you desire. You will
[3:35:33] have it.
[3:35:35] Even if it's a million dollar,
[3:35:38] it will be right there.
[3:35:41] It happened before.
[3:35:43] Some people don't know the story I'm
[3:35:44] talking about.
[3:35:46] Brother
[3:35:48] in America,
[3:35:50] sister
[3:35:52] and and he was giving her a testimony
[3:35:55] and sister said amen
[3:35:58] because it was a supernatural testimony
[3:36:00] of what he had done
[3:36:03] and she believed it she accepted it.
[3:36:06] Then brother Bham was was moved like
[3:36:11] he was moved for
[3:36:13] and he said okay ask whatever you desire
[3:36:17] whatever you desire now.
[3:36:21] you will have it. Do you notice by
[3:36:23] revelation as I'm speaking as I'm
[3:36:26] closing some two three people will get
[3:36:28] revelation
[3:36:30] and something supernatural
[3:36:32] will be done
[3:36:35] and by the
[3:36:37] whatever you need and he gave her
[3:36:39] examples. You can ask for
[3:36:44] ask, not for tomorrow, not for next
[3:36:47] year, not for later, but now now.

[3:36:55] to be saved.
[3:36:57] They were very, very, very rugged,
[3:37:00] nonbelievers.
[3:37:02] You know who can save a heart of an
[3:37:04] unsaidable person?
[3:37:06] They came and knocked down by the Holy
[3:37:08] Ghost
[3:37:09] and gave their life to Jesus
[3:37:12] right away.
[3:37:16] Now, can I speak to you? Born again son
[3:37:19] of God, daughter of God.

[3:37:44] pray, believe you shall receive them and
[3:37:47] ye shall have them."
[3:37:50] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[3:37:55] Come on now. You have a deep within you.
