[1:02:24] the contracts which they we have
[1:02:28] believe as the young people had already
[1:02:30] reached out to in the first
[1:02:32] outreach

[1:02:52] and these they had already had brother
[1:02:54] joel speak the first time they they
[1:02:56] loved it the second time someone tried
[1:02:58] to confuse them and then the third time
[1:03:00] you know brother joel felt like i will
[1:03:02] not manage them anymore so i need to
[1:03:04] bring the somewhere else

[1:12:15] [Music]
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:48] scripture in genesis chapter 4 verse 7.
[1:12:53] [Music]
[1:12:58] today we will be proceeding with a part
[1:13:00] two of the power of free moral agents
[1:13:05] [Music]
[1:13:12] father we are going to read your word we
[1:13:14] ask that the holy spirit will come and
[1:13:16] give us utterance this morning
[1:13:23] we are going to speak to the patches of
[1:13:24] the blood those that you purchased
[1:13:29] your church they cannot you bless them
[1:13:32] now
[1:13:33] speak to them
[1:13:34] in jesus name
[1:13:44] genesis chapter 4 verse 7 if thou doest
[1:13:46] well shalt thou not be accepted
[1:13:52] yes

[1:14:02] shalt thou not be accepted
[1:14:06] but and if thou doest not well see lieth
[1:14:09] at the door and unto thee shall be his
[1:14:11] desire and thou
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:19] [Music]
[1:14:26] h
[1:14:36] may the lord bless you and bless the
[1:14:38] reading of his word
[1:14:45] [Music]
[1:14:52] i'm going to proceed or continue with
[1:14:54] the sharing i started last sunday
[1:15:00] because of the short time we usually
[1:15:01] have we are not able to always con
[1:15:04] complete the thought that god has given
[1:15:06] to us
[1:15:12] so that's why we have to have a part two
[1:15:14] or a part three or a part four because
[1:15:16] we have a short time in one service
[1:15:22] service
[1:15:37] so we want to bring it also in another
[1:15:39] service so we can be able to
[1:15:41] receive the whole benefit of it
[1:15:51] amen and that's the reason why i don't
[1:15:53] always want to hold you for so long two
[1:15:55] hours three hours
[1:16:00] we cannot read and understand the whole
[1:16:03] bible in one service but a bible
[1:16:17] so
[1:16:18] as usual take perhaps one hour or up to
[1:16:21] one hour i'm gonna join the twilight
[1:16:23] star one game if i delay maybe it will
[1:16:25] be about one hour and a half but i just
[1:16:27] pray that you give me your undivided
[1:16:29] attention
[1:16:47] seven way to call anyone uh listen we
[1:16:50] need that i know many things might sound
[1:16:52] new but i'm not going to have any
[1:16:54] doctrine today just start wishing
[1:16:58] money
[1:17:29] and we found out that there is a power
[1:17:31] that god has given man
[1:17:37] and this power which he has given man he
[1:17:39] has not given it to any other creature
[1:17:45] the bible does not say that the serpent
[1:17:48] came and beguiled
[1:17:50] the serpent that was in the oh the beast
[1:17:53] let me say that the serpent came and
[1:17:55] beguiled the beast
[1:17:56] a bible
[1:18:10] which is devil 27
[1:18:14] that came down in the garden of eden
[1:18:18] and beguiled
[1:18:20] the serpent which we know is the beast
[1:18:40] that we don't believe
[1:18:42] that it was a snake speaking to it
[1:18:48] now we'll go get on a coward because it
[1:18:50] was not a snake
[1:18:52] commander the bible describes that god
[1:18:56] cast it afterwards and that's when it
[1:18:58] became a snake
[1:19:05] but at first it was a beast
[1:19:27] the bible says of all the peace that the
[1:19:29] lord god had made it was the most subtle
[1:19:32] baby
[1:19:45] [Applause]
[1:19:55] that serpent was more subject it was
[1:19:57] more intelligent than even the
[1:19:59] chimpanzees
[1:20:38] that is the only difference between us
[1:20:40] and that beast which was a which tempted
[1:20:42] eve
[1:20:59] of eden understanding where it comes
[1:21:01] he came straight to this place
[1:21:05] and he borrowed his body
[1:21:09] he entered into the body of that beast
[1:21:36] but you cannot get a seed of animals and
[1:21:39] mingle into the seed of a human being to
[1:21:42] bring forth or mingle into the egg of a
[1:21:44] woman or human being to bring forth life
[1:21:46] what happens
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:22:23] theory of evolution
[1:22:27] [Music]
[1:22:32] they said that man was an animal he went
[1:22:34] on changing changing changing until he
[1:22:36] looks like he
[1:22:56] [Music]
[1:23:05] and his seed had the ability of mingling
[1:23:09] with that of the human race and bringing
[1:23:11] forth life
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:42] [Music]
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:57] the beast had no choice over their
[1:23:59] bodies as soon as
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:41] and then all of a sudden my mom they
[1:24:43] felt something
[1:24:48] and killed themselves
[1:24:51] hallelujah amen praise the name of the
[1:24:53] lord
[1:24:54] someone said because of that we don't
[1:24:55] eat breeds oh one way again
[1:25:11] so if you don't eat the pigs because
[1:25:13] they they have demons also shouldn't eat
[1:25:15] water because it also had those demons
[1:25:25] go let us proceed with our teaching
[1:25:26] category
[1:25:27] so we find out to china that
[1:25:30] animals have no
[1:25:32] choice over what happens
[1:25:37] amen they are only like a proxy
[1:25:43] whatever happens it's all right tonight
[1:25:48] they have no power
[1:25:50] there
[1:25:51] are themselves
[1:26:22] and he knocked the choice was the choice
[1:26:28] the choice that she made
[1:26:31] to accept to each of the fruit of the
[1:26:34] tree
[1:26:54] [Music]
[1:27:16] because in genesis they were the ones in
[1:27:19] that transgression
[1:27:21] [Music]
[1:27:22] and also
[1:27:24] um
[1:27:24] it was not the man that sinned it was
[1:27:27] the woman that sinned
[1:27:42] shall be upon your husband
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:28:08] you know someone some people think that
[1:28:09] when they go in marriage they are
[1:28:10] partners
[1:28:12] people working together on the same
[1:28:14] level
[1:28:26] and the bible says that the women must
[1:28:28] submit to their husbands in all things
[1:28:36] and so we go back to eve can you get
[1:28:38] today so because eve made a choice
[1:28:49] because of all the sicknesses because of
[1:28:51] that choice and what does this
[1:28:53] call the death because of that choice
[1:29:07] oh
[1:29:22] he has brought life
[1:29:24] the first one was a living soul a
[1:29:27] assault remaining but the second one is
[1:29:30] a awakening spirit
[1:29:33] hallelujah so now from that can you we
[1:29:36] are able
[1:29:44] it is called the power of free moral
[1:29:48] agencies
[1:30:02] each of you that is under the sound of
[1:30:04] my voice
[1:30:32] that do not try at any time to blame
[1:30:35] anyone for whatever happens in your life
[1:30:44] whatever happens in your life is your
[1:30:46] own making your
[1:30:59] whatever happens to you we are never
[1:31:01] going to say our own makings
[1:31:05] you have power to change the world
[1:31:07] around you

[1:31:30] we are all born in sin bible
[1:31:32] naturalism
[1:31:33] we have the power what would happen in
[1:31:35] your mind even within us muslims to make
[1:31:38] a choice
[1:31:40] we were born in sin
[1:31:42] but we shall not

[1:37:49] only those who are born in the arab
[1:37:50] countries or those who are born in this
[1:37:52] place no
[1:37:53] serpent cities everywhere
