[4:12] Praise the Lord.
[4:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; If you're really free, we ought to
[4:18] praise his name.
[4:20] &gt;&gt; We give glory and honor to the name of
[4:22] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[4:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; For giving us such a wonderful
[4:27] opportunity again.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:29] &gt;&gt; To come before his presence.
[4:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we thank God certainly for
[4:34] this time
[4:36] because it is a wonderful thing for us
[4:38] to be in the presence of God.
[4:42] Praise the Lord. We are going to share
[4:45] something as the Lord will lead.
[4:50] Pastor requested me to stand in
[4:54] because he's not around with us.
[4:57] But we surely thank God for everything.
[5:01] continue praying for him wherever he is
[5:05] that the Lord will use him wherever he
[5:06] is.
[5:08] Praise the Lord. We don't open from the
[5:11] Bible
[5:13] the book of John chapter 8 verse 36.
[5:18] Praise the Lord. Uh John chapter 8 verse
[5:23] 36.
[5:26] I pray the Lord helps us.
[5:29] Praise the Lord.
[5:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:37] &gt;&gt; We're just going to read only verse one.
[5:41] If the son therefore
[5:44] shall make you free, he shall be free
[5:47] indeed.
[5:57] Hallelujah.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Dear heaven, most precious
[6:01] loving God,
[6:04] as we approach the throne of mercy,
[6:08] I pray the Lord Jesus
[6:10] that you come and take over, Lord,
[6:13] use this lips, oh, Father,
[6:16] take away everything in it, Lord,
[6:20] that may hinder your word to come out.
[6:23] that your children may be blessed
[6:26] &gt;&gt; that we may return out of this place
[6:29] with a change heart desire to be with
[6:32] you in the service
[6:34] and be with our pastor as well Lord
[6:36] Jesus
[6:37] we commit those who are following online
[6:39] Jesus
[6:41] may please be with them anoint them
[6:45] receive their portion in this service
[6:47] I pray let thy presence come and take
[6:49] over in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus
[6:52] Christ.
[6:53] Let us sit.
[6:56] Praise the Lord. So we are going to
[6:58] share something here brief
[7:01] as the Lord will lead us.
[7:04] Uh we have read from the book of uh John
[7:07] 8:36.
[7:10] The Bible says that if the son therefore
[7:13] shall make you free,
[7:17] yes shall be free indeed.
[7:22] And we are sharing our heading that we
[7:24] are sharing a topic whatever you may
[7:25] call it.
[7:28] A season of freedom.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:33] &gt;&gt; The season of freedom
[7:36] usually comes after you have gone
[7:38] through a a life of bondage.
[7:42] Meaning there's something which should
[7:43] have tied you.
[7:46] But you would have been desiring to have
[7:47] freedom.
[7:50] But the Bible tells us here, "If the son
[7:53] therefore shall make you free,
[7:56] it is indeed that you're free."
[7:59] It is not a joke. It is not a play as
[8:03] long as you believe it. I say amen to
[8:06] the word of God.
[8:08] Indeed, you'll be free. Praise the Lord.
[8:12] There are there are yolks of bondage
[8:16] that we may share a few of them today.
[8:20] Maybe you can read some of them. A
[8:22] common scripture in the book of
[8:23] Galatians
[8:27] chapter 5.
[8:29] &gt;&gt; Galatians chapter 5
[8:32] and verses
[8:34] uh 19 to 21
[8:37] something that we commonly read.
[8:40] But I want us read also now.
[8:43] Praise the Lord. Now the works of the
[8:46] flesh are manifest
[8:49] which are this adultery,
[8:52] &gt;&gt; fornication,
[8:53] uncleanness,
[8:55] lasness,
[8:58] idolatry,
[8:59] witchcraft,
[9:01] hatred, variance, emulations,
[9:06] wrath, strife,
[9:09] sed seditions,
[9:12] heresies,
[9:13] uh envy,
[9:15] M mur
[9:19] drunkardness,
[9:21] revilings,
[9:23] and such like
[9:25] of which I tell you before,
[9:29] as also I told you in time past,
[9:33] that they which do such things
[9:38] shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
[9:41] It simply means that when you do these
[9:44] things here, you are still in bondage.
[9:48] Therefore, you need freedom. Freedom
[9:51] from all these things that the Bible has
[9:53] counted.
[9:55] You need freedom from fornication.
[9:57] You need freedom from uncleanness.
[10:00] You need freedom from living a life of
[10:02] hatred,
[10:04] living a life of strife.
[10:07] You need freedom from murder
[10:09] or drunkenness
[10:11] and many more other things of such
[10:14] because for you to get freedom
[10:17] there must be bondage. And after bondage
[10:21] when you desire if the Lord when you
[10:23] desire
[10:24] freedom,
[10:26] God will come and set you free.
[10:29] Reverend,
[10:30] &gt;&gt; there's need for you to know
[10:34] what your your true freedom is.
[10:39] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we live like we are
[10:40] free
[10:43] yet we are not free.
[10:45] Each one of us can tell
[10:48] that indeed I'm not free from this point
[10:50] here.
[10:53] There's need for you to know the true
[10:54] freedom that we are talking about
[10:58] which the Bible tells tells I yielded
[11:00] your members servants to uncleanness
[11:06] and to iniquity
[11:09] and to iniquity.
[11:11] Praise the Lord. EVEN SO NOW YIELD YOUR
[11:14] MEMBERS SERVANTS TO RIGHTEOUSNESS AND TO
[11:16] HOLINESS.
[11:21] For here were the servants of sin.
[11:25] Here were here were free from
[11:28] righteousness.
[11:31] MEANING THAT IN THE OLD OLD man
[11:34] we lived a life of sin
[11:37] without any righteousness.
[11:40] We are not free at all.
[11:43] Every time we lived a life of guilt.
[11:47] Meaning the only man was having
[11:48] dominion.
[11:50] HE WAS having control over you.
[11:53] HE WAS CONTROLLING each and every ONE OF
[11:55] US. WE NEVER HAD A FREEDOM. EVEN
[11:59] SOMETIME WHEN WE SEEMED FREE
[12:02] for sure we're NOT FREE UNTIL CHRIST
[12:04] DIED ON THE CROSS
[12:07] THAT YOU ARE SET FREE UNTIL THAT TIME
[12:11] WHEN YOU ARE TOLD THAT CHRIST DIED on
[12:12] the cross for your sins
[12:15] and you believed him. YOU GAVE YOUR LIFE
[12:17] to Christ. YOU ARE BAPTIZED. NOW YOU ARE
[12:21] SET FREE. BROTHER YOU NEED TO BE FREE
[12:24] INDEED.
[12:26] THAT IDENTITY OF FREEDOM MUST BE
[12:28] IDENTIFIED WITH YOU,
[12:30] MEANING THAT it's no longer struggling
[12:34] to be free, but you're free indeed.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[12:39] &gt;&gt; For when you ARE SERVANTS OF SERVANTS OF
[12:41] SIN, you have free from righteousness.
[12:46] Verse
[12:49] 21 says that what fruits hast then in
[12:53] those things whereof here are now
[12:55] ashamed
[13:02] for the end for the end of those things
[13:04] death
[13:07] but now being made free from sin
[13:12] and become servants of God to God.
[13:16] Yeah. Have your fruit unto holiness
[13:21] and the everlasting life.
[13:24] I mean and the end everlasting life.
[13:28] It simply means that you have passed
[13:30] from sin to life.
[13:33] Now you are just living this life on
[13:34] this world
[13:36] simply to serve God in freedom.
[13:39] But even after this life
[13:42] there must be freedom IN CHRIST.
[13:46] WHERE GOD WILL WELCOME YOU AND SAY WELL
[13:49] done my servant
[13:51] then you have done all that which is
[13:53] right
[13:54] when you are here on earth Christ will
[13:57] no longer count that which you committed
[14:00] by mistake Christ will not count that
[14:03] which you committed
[14:06] which you committed by mistake
[14:10] it was all it was all put under grace
[14:14] and Christ set you free.
[14:17] Praise the Lord. Now, what is true
[14:19] freedom?
[14:21] True freedom is ability to say no to the
[14:23] works of the devil.
[14:26] When the DEVIL WHEN THE DEVIL TELLS YOU
[14:30] do this, you have a right to say no.
[14:33] That is a true freedom we are talking
[14:34] about.
[14:36] It is also ability to exercise
[14:40] that which you have received from
[14:42] Christ.
[14:44] and obey him all the time.
[14:48] Praise the Lord. The ability to exercise
[14:52] that which YOU HAVE RECEIVED
[14:54] THAT YOU HAVE FREEDOM, you have power,
[14:57] YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO SPEAK TO EVERY
[15:00] SPIRIT
[15:01] which may come lingering AND NEAR YOU
[15:04] AND TELL IT BEHIND ME SATAN. SATAN DOES
[15:09] NOT HAVE AUTHORITY OVER YOU
[15:11] TO GO BEFORE YOU. THE SPIRIT OF THE
[15:14] DEVIL MUST ALWAYS GO BEHIND YOU TRYING
[15:18] TO PEEP WHAT TO DO. BUT BECAUSE YOU ARE
[15:20] ROOTED in Christ, you have ability to
[15:23] speak. YOU HAVE AUTHORITY TO SPEAK AND
[15:27] EVERY SPIRIT WILL BOW DOWN AND SAY YES
[15:30] SIR AND YOU CONTINUE YOUR HEAD. Praise
[15:32] God. Praise the Lord. WHEN THE LORD
[15:35] JESUS CHRIST was tempted after his
[15:38] prayer and fasting,
[15:40] he had authority of the word.
[15:43] He had the ability to exercise the WORD
[15:46] BECAUSE IT WAS in him. NOW THAT CHRIST
[15:49] is in you,
[15:51] you too has AN ABILITY TO EXERCISE the
[15:54] freedom that Christ has GIVEN YOU. THAT
[15:58] FREEDOM IS YOU AS BROTHERS.
[16:00] RECEIVE IT EVEN NOW AND GO out there AND
[16:03] EXERCISE IT.
[16:05] PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; WHAT is true freedom?
[16:08] &gt;&gt; IS HAVING TRUE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR
[16:11] TRUE potential in Christ.
[16:16] MEANING THAT EVERYTHING IN YOU FUNCTIONS
[16:19] LIKE CHRIST IS IN YOU.
[16:22] The members OF YOUR BODY ARE BEING USED
[16:24] TO SERVE GOD, NOT TO EXERCISE EVIL. NOW
[16:28] THEY ARE FUNCTIONING
[16:30] to serve GOD TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
[16:34] TO DO WHAT IS THE WILL OF GOD. THEY ALL
[16:37] FUNCTIONING
[16:39] towards serving God.
[16:42] Brethren, whatever we do, whether I go
[16:45] to school, whether I go to home, whether
[16:48] I'm with friends, whe I'm at the
[16:50] workplace, THE FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR
[16:53] TRUE FREEDOM must be exercised.
[16:57] You should not exercise only when you're
[16:59] in church.
[17:00] YOU SHOULD EXERCISE EVEN WHEN YOU'RE
[17:02] OUTSIDE.
[17:03] WHERE YOU TELL A FRIEND
[17:06] IN ME are of Christ
[17:08] these things are just easier to deal
[17:10] with AND EVERYTHING WILL BE SORTED.
[17:14] PRAISE THE LORD. MEANING THAT THE
[17:16] FUNCTIONALITY OF YOUR TRUE POTENTIAL in
[17:18] Christ
[17:20] is now working and that is true freedom.
[17:23] I'm talking about
[17:25] what IS TRUE FREEDOM. TRUE FREEDOM IS TO
[17:28] HAVE AN opportunity
[17:31] ask whatsoever you desire
[17:34] whereby WHEN YOU HAVE FREEDOM. YOU HAVE
[17:37] AN OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO CHRIST. TELL
[17:40] CHRIST YOUR SERVANT is
[17:44] I need a job BECAUSE YOU HAVE TRUE
[17:47] FREEDOM IN YOU. YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SIN
[17:50] WHICH IS LINGERING AROUND YOU. THAT TRUE
[17:53] FREEDOM GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET
[17:56] WHATSOEVER you desire from God
[17:59] because you are free. Ask whatsoever you
[18:02] want and it shall be given. Knock and it
[18:07] will be OPEN FOR YOU. SEEK AND YOU'LL
[18:10] FIND IT. PRAISE THE LORD simply because
[18:14] one day Christ came to you. He was
[18:18] knocking your heart
[18:20] and YOU OPENED IT.
[18:22] NOW CHRIST IS IN YOU. YOU HAVE TRUE
[18:24] FREEDOM TO GO AND GET WHATSOEVER YOU
[18:27] DESIRE FROM HIM.
[18:29] BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT FREEDOM.
[18:32] It is now you TO GO TO HIM AND TELL HIM,
[18:34] "FATHER, I need a job. Father, I need
[18:38] this AND THAT." BECAUSE YOU ALLOWED HIM
[18:41] IN YOU.
[18:42] NOW THAT IS IN YOU AND YOU HAVE THE TRUE
[18:45] FREEDOM. YOU HAVE ALSO OPPORTUNITY AS A
[18:49] CHILD OF GOD TO GO AND GET WHATSOEVER
[18:51] YOU DESIRE.
[18:53] PRAISE THE LORD. JESUS KNOCKED AT YOUR
[18:56] door and you are able to open FOR HIM.
[18:59] NOW IS LIVING IN YOUR heart your true
[19:03] freedom.
[19:04] Leave us for Christ not as children of
[19:07] the world. Exercise your freedom sister
[19:10] brother.
[19:12] Wherever you go, DO NOT LIMIT THE
[19:14] FREEDOM THAT CHRIST HAS GIVEN to us.
[19:18] Christ has given us freedom without any
[19:21] PRICE TO PAY. WE SIMPLY SUBMIT ourselves
[19:24] to him.
[19:26] Praise the Lord and he will BE WITH US.
[19:30] NOW IF YOU know if you have you have
[19:32] known a true freedom
[19:35] then you own it all.
[19:38] Galatians chapter 5 and verse one.
[19:42] Praise the Lord. Are we together? That
[19:45] is great. Galatians chapter 5. Just
[19:49] verse one. Here the Bible says that
[19:53] stand first therefore
[19:56] in the liberty wherewith Christ has made
[19:58] us free and be not entangled again with
[20:02] the yoke of bondage.
[20:14] Paul says here, "Stand fast, therefore."
[20:20] And he says that in the liberty
[20:23] WHEREWITH CHRIST HAS MADE US FREE.
[20:27] That is the kind of liberty that Christ
[20:29] has given you.
[20:32] PAUL IS JUST TRYING TO ENCOURAGE US here
[20:35] that we need to stand fast in that
[20:37] liberty, not hiding our freedom.
[20:42] Praise the Lord. Praise God. That is a
[20:46] freedom that God has given unto us
[20:49] that we need to stand in there for.
[20:52] PRAISE THE LORD. USE YOUR FREEDOM to
[20:54] love God,
[20:57] to love others,
[20:59] not to hate people.
[21:01] not to backbite people, not to be
[21:04] against your brother.
[21:06] Let that freedom be to serve God.
[21:10] Colossians chapter 5
[21:13] verse 13. The Bible says
[21:17] for brethren,
[21:19] ye have been called unto liberty
[21:22] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[21:26] the flesh.
[21:31] But by love serve one another.
[21:37] Don't use your liberty that you have
[21:40] to speak against your brother who's
[21:41] weak,
[21:43] but instead use that liberty THAT YOU
[21:46] HAVE, THAT FREEDOM that you have to pray
[21:50] for your brother.
[21:52] Not because you're not you're not
[21:53] committing adultery
[21:55] and you're seeing the other IS
[21:56] COMMITTING ADULTERY. SO YOU USE THAT
[21:59] FREEDOM TO SPEAK AGAINST THE OTHER. No
[22:01] brother, that is not the way to do it.
[22:23] Whether he's a believer, you have to
[22:25] love them. BECAUSE THAT FREEDOM that you
[22:28] have, when you really exercise it
[22:31] freely,
[22:33] it will identify Christ to those
[22:34] neighbors of yours.
[22:38] If they hate you, they will come to
[22:41] understand that the person this person
[22:43] has
[22:45] inside him seems like there's something
[22:47] different.
[22:50] You see the way he behaves,
[22:52] even when we talk about against him,
[22:56] even when we talk about against him.
[22:59] Yesterday we beat the other day we beat
[23:01] his child
[23:03] but he didn't act roughly.
[23:07] The person was just gentle
[23:09] because you have the true freedom in
[23:11] Christ.
[23:13] use it to love others,
[23:17] not to hate people.
[23:19] Verse 15 says that, "But if bite and
[23:23] devour one another,
[23:26] take heed that he be not consumed of one
[23:29] another,
[23:34] I say then,
[23:36] walk in the spirit,
[23:39] and he shall not fulfill the lust of the
[23:41] flesh, lust of the flesh,
[23:45] Brother, sister,
[23:47] true freedom is connected to having a
[23:49] spirit of God in you
[23:54] that you may not fulfill the lust of the
[23:56] flesh.
[23:59] Because if you come this freedom,
[24:03] there will come a point when you cannot
[24:05] exercise it.
[24:08] When you're squeezed,
[24:10] when you're tried,
[24:12] when people catch you when they desire
[24:14] to do whatever they want,
[24:17] you can't exercise that freedom.
[24:20] But let that freedom be exercised
[24:23] in a way of Steven.
[24:26] When he was being stoned, HE DID NOT
[24:28] SAY, "YOU FOOLS, WHY ARE YOU STONING
[24:30] ME?"
[24:31] BUT HE WAS JUST PRAYING for them. He was
[24:34] exercising the freedom
[24:36] that he had IN CHRIST. HE WAS NOT USING
[24:39] IT AGAINST PEOPLE.
[24:42] PRAISE THE LORD. BUT IF YOU HAVE A
[24:44] FREEDOM WHICH IS CREATED BY YOU,
[24:47] WHEN SUCH TIME COMES,
[24:50] brother sister, you cannot stand it.
[24:53] You'll simply fall away.
[24:55] FOR THE FLESH lusteth against the
[24:57] spirit,
[25:00] AND EVEN THE SPIRIT VICE vers
[25:05] to the one to the other,
[25:08] so that he cannot do the things that you
[25:11] would.
[25:13] All this true freedom you have tal we
[25:15] have talked about
[25:17] you cannot exercise them
[25:20] because if you live in the flesh
[25:23] and you lust after the things of the
[25:24] flesh YOU ARE AGAINST THE SPIRIT.
[25:28] Therefore brother you have NO AUTHORITY
[25:31] TO EXERCISE this true freedom
[25:34] and it needs you to yield to the spirit
[25:37] and when the spirit has control over
[25:38] you'll
[25:40] be therefore to be against the flesh.
[25:44] AND A FLESH WILL NEVER HAVE CONTROL over
[25:45] you.
[25:47] Praise the Lord. That is a true identity
[25:50] of true freedom.
[25:52] Praise the Lord. We are sharing the
[25:55] season of freedom.
[25:57] I hope this season of freedom
[26:00] will come upon you
[26:02] that indeed come upon you that you may
[26:06] find Christ.
[26:08] Rise aloud. We want to see something
[26:10] here
[26:12] in verse chapter 2 of uh 2 Corinthians.
[26:18] Chapter 3 verse 17.
[26:22] Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Are we
[26:26] alive?
[26:28] Are we together?
[26:29] Are we free in Christ?
[26:32] IF WE ARE FREE, LET'S THANK the Lord.
[26:35] Praise the Lord. AND IF YOU'RE
[26:36] [screaming] NOT FREE, GOD WILL SET YOU
[26:39] FREE BECAUSE FREEDOM IS YOURS BY YOU
[26:43] COMING TO CHURCH, YOU DESIRE FREEDOM.
[26:47] THEREFORE, YOU MUST GO BACK FREE.
[26:50] EVERY SPIRIT MUST BE bound and must
[26:54] remain
[26:56] wherever it goes. But for you, you must
[27:00] go back free.
[27:02] Praise the Lord. 1 Corinthians
[27:06] chapter 3:1 17
[27:08] that freedom brother sister
[27:11] must be identical in the children of God
[27:15] you must exercise it with it is fullness
[27:20] do not limit God
[27:22] when sickness comes
[27:25] all the time you want to identify
[27:26] yourself with the hospital
[27:30] but there must be a time Should I then
[27:33] exercise your freedom
[27:36] and speak TO THE SPIRIT OVER ANY KIND OF
[27:39] SICKNESS
[27:40] that you have no RIGHT OVER ME?
[27:44] THEREFORE, depart away from my body.
[27:47] FOR THIS BODY IS A TEMPLE OF GOD.
[27:49] I AM FREE. Praise the Lord. That is the
[27:53] kind of freedom we desire, brethren.
[27:57] Not freedom of camouflage.
[27:59] Should be a reality.
[28:02] True freedom
[28:05] in Christ.
[28:07] Praise the Lord.
[28:13] 2 Corinthians 3:1 17.
[28:17] &gt;&gt; Now the Lord is a is that spirit.
[28:22] And where the spirit and where the
[28:25] spirit of the Lord is,
[28:29] there is liberty.
[28:32] Amen.
[28:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[28:34] &gt;&gt; Where the spirit of the Lord is,
[28:38] there is liberty.
[28:40] In the Bible, Jesus moved to different
[28:43] places.
[28:45] &gt;&gt; But wherever Christ reached,
[28:48] liberty must come TO THAT PLACE. FREEDOM
[28:51] MUST COME TO THAT PLACE. HEALING MUST
[28:54] COME TO THAT PLACE.
[28:56] Rising people from the dead must COME TO
[28:58] THAT PLACE.
[29:00] NO problem must come TO THAT PLACE
[29:03] BECAUSE CHRIST HAS REACHED THAT PLACE.
[29:06] Everyone is supposed to be set free
[29:09] except maybe the Pharisees
[29:12] &gt;&gt; who had a different idea
[29:16] who followed after Jesus
[29:19] with their own ideas as human beings.
[29:23] For them they never desired for that
[29:24] freedom.
[29:27] They desire just to look for a way of
[29:30] putting him down.
[29:33] But as long as Christ stepped in every
[29:35] place,
[29:38] there was liberty.
[29:40] Mark 5 verse1.
[29:43] Mark 5:1.
[29:46] We are just going to read something here
[29:50] that will let us know
[29:53] that wherever Christ reaches
[29:57] there is freedom.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Every demon trembles
[30:02] and they run away.
[30:05] Praise the Lord. We are going to share
[30:07] something about the mad man here.
[30:13] Praise the Lord.
[30:15] uh from verse one.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says that
[30:20] &gt;&gt; and they came uh over to the other side
[30:23] of the sea
[30:26] &gt;&gt; into the country of the Gadenness.
[30:33] And when he was come out of the ship,
[30:36] immediately there met him out of the
[30:39] tomb a man with unclean spirit.
[30:45] Just immediately the Lord Jesus Christ
[30:47] came out of the ship.
[30:49] After they crossed the water, there was
[30:52] a man, the Bible tells us that
[30:55] immediately he met him out of the tombs,
[30:58] a man with unclean spirit,
[31:04] WHO HAD HIS DWELLING among the tombs,
[31:07] and no man could bind him.
[31:10] No, not with chains.
[31:13] because that he had been often bound
[31:17] with feathers and chains
[31:20] and the chains HAD BEEN PLUGGED AS SAND
[31:22] BY him
[31:25] and fets broken in pieces.
[31:28] NEITHER COULD ANY MAN HIM.
[31:31] [clears throat]
[31:33] THIS MAN WAS SO DANGEROUS.
[31:36] NO MAN COULD TRY HIM. PRAISE THE LORD.
[31:40] and always
[31:42] night and day. He was in the mountains
[31:47] and in the tombs
[31:49] crying and cutting himself with stones.
[31:53] He was simply a man who was living with
[31:54] no freedom.
[31:56] His work was just crying,
[31:59] cutting himself with stones. That was
[32:02] simply a duty that he was doing
[32:05] because his body was being tormented.
[32:09] demons had possessed him.
[32:12] He was no longer having freedom as a
[32:13] human being.
[32:15] He was taken away by certain spirits
[32:19] and he was no longer living among
[32:20] people. This man was just isolated
[32:23] there.
[32:25] He found himself
[32:27] loving to be alone and even people also
[32:30] on the other hand.
[32:33] He said that he stayed away from them
[32:36] because he had a spirit. The Bible says
[32:39] unclean spirits
[32:41] and but when HE HE SAW JESUS A far off.
[32:46] He ran and worshiped him
[32:49] and cried with a loud voice
[32:51] and said, "What have I to do with thee,
[32:55] JESUS, THE SON OF the most high God?
[33:02] I adje by God
[33:05] that thou torment me not?
[33:08] For he said unto him,
[33:11] come out of man, no unclean spirit.
[33:15] THIS IS A STORY of a man.
[33:18] Who could have lived the way we live
[33:19] today?
[33:21] With freedom, you can go to the shop. No
[33:25] one can chase you. You can go to school.
[33:29] No one will send you away. You can go
[33:31] wherever you desire. Everyone will
[33:33] WELCOME YOU. BUT THIS MAN HERE, THE
[33:37] SPIRIT THAT POSSESSED HIM,
[33:39] the unclean spirit, he never had freedom
[33:42] anywhere.
[33:44] HE WAS HATED even by his own people.
[33:47] BECAUSE AT FIRST THE PEOPLE SAID THEY
[33:50] could manage.
[33:52] I TRIED USING CHAINS. LET US TIE THIS
[33:55] MAN AS WE TRY TO LOOK for a solution for
[33:57] him. BUT A MAN COULD JUST STARE DOWN HIS
[34:00] chains
[34:01] and go again after people.
[34:04] Praise the Lord. He was not a man who
[34:06] was living under freedom.
[34:09] He was being tormented by demons
[34:12] and demons were waiting for that moment.
[34:16] When this man would be alone,
[34:19] when he's just alone without people
[34:22] that I could START MAKING HIM CUT HIS
[34:24] BODY,
[34:26] maybe the body was itching.
[34:28] He thought maybe by scratching it
[34:31] could find freedom
[34:33] and there was no freedom. At least maybe
[34:36] when he was with people
[34:39] maybe people could rescue him from
[34:40] cutting himself.
[34:43] He had a bit of freedom,
[34:45] but it wasn't full.
[34:47] BECAUSE THE DEMONS IN him
[34:50] had AUTHORITY
[34:52] OVER HIS BODY. They could command HIS
[34:54] BODY, CUT THE CHAINS, run away and that
[34:59] would happen. Praise the Lord. You see
[35:02] how unclean spirit possess a man
[35:05] and remove all the freedom from you.
[35:08] Praise be name to the name of the Lord.
[35:11] Praise God.
[35:12] This man lived under the tombs.
[35:16] He just lived THERE IN THE MOUNTAINS.
[35:18] JUST A place of ISOLATION
[35:22] WHERE he had no hopes.
[35:24] He had no hopes that no one could ever
[35:26] come before him.
[35:28] NO ONE COULD have set him free BECAUSE
[35:31] THE UNCLEAN SPIRIT had possessed him.
[35:34] I don't know how the unclean spirit
[35:36] possessed him.
[35:38] What he has done, I don't know. But
[35:41] surely We are interested HERE TO KNOW
[35:45] HOW HIS FREEDOM CAME ABOUT.
[35:48] PRAISE THE LORD. AMEN.
[35:49] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN YOU'RE GETTING YOUR
[35:50] FREEDOM, BROTHER,
[35:52] SOMETIMES it doesn't MATTER OF WHAT
[35:55] YOU'VE DONE. YOU SIMPLY NEED TO APPLY.
[35:58] You simply need to apply
[36:01] the FORMULA OF THE FORMULA OF THE HOLY
[36:04] SPIRIT
[36:06] and you get your freedom. Praise the
[36:08] Lord. And it doesn't matter.
[36:11] Whether you get that bondage
[36:14] when you are still in the world before
[36:16] you gave your life to Christ, it doesn't
[36:19] matter. BUT ALL IT MATTERS, HAVE YOU
[36:22] FOUND CHRIST?
[36:23] &gt;&gt; HAVE YOU TAKEN YOUR LIFE TO HIM? HAVE
[36:26] YOU FULLY SUBMITTED YOUR LIFE TO HIM?
[36:28] ALL THE MEMBERS OF YOUR BODY and you set
[36:31] free. Praise the Lord.
[36:35] That is the kind of man this man was
[36:39] just in the tomb alone.
[36:42] Whether his children were eating, he
[36:43] doesn't know.
[36:46] Whether his family was okay, he doesn't
[36:48] know.
[36:49] He was just crying for himself
[36:52] because demons were disturbing him. HE
[36:55] WAS HAVING NO PEACE. He couldn't have it
[36:58] at all.
[37:00] Just demons around him,
[37:03] unclean spirits,
[37:05] just dancing around him,
[37:07] celebrating to see him CUT HIS BODY.
[37:11] DEMONS JUST CELEBRATING TO HIM. SEE him
[37:13] crying.
[37:15] BROTHER, SISTER,
[37:17] NEVER ALLOWS DEMONS TO CRY TO TO BE
[37:20] happy
[37:22] over every situation that you go through
[37:24] life.
[37:26] When a situation comes,
[37:29] you become gloomy.
[37:32] Don't want to talk to anybody.
[37:34] You want just to make sure everyone
[37:37] knows that you have problems.
[37:39] You're just annoyed.
[37:43] You hunt YOUR FREEDOM AND THAT freedom
[37:46] will be a dominion OVER. IT WILL
[37:48] DOMINATE YOUR LIFE
[37:50] AND EVERY TIME
[37:53] YOU HAVE FREEDOM. Even when poverty
[37:55] comes, YOU SEE WHAT IS POVERTY. CHRIST
[37:59] HAS SET ME FREE. I JUST HAVE TO GO TO
[38:02] HIM. GOD, I NEED what to eat. AND
[38:05] THEREFORE HE GIVES YOU AND HE BLESSES
[38:07] YOU WITH THE WORK OF YOUR HANDS and you
[38:10] get it in abundance.
[38:12] PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN SICKNESS COMES by
[38:16] the demon of sickness, Christ let me
[38:18] first pass by
[38:21] to the family of brother.
[38:23] Perhaps I may put him down.
[38:26] GETTING BROTHER
[38:28] WELL CHARGED IN HIS HOME.
[38:30] PRAISE THE LORD. HE HAS FREEDOM ALL OVER
[38:33] HIS HOME. I WANT YOU DEMONS WILL RUN
[38:35] AWAY BEFORE REACHING YOU BECAUSE I KNOW
[38:38] shame is a DIFFERENT PERSON ALTOGETHER.
[38:42] THAT IS THE KIND OF FREEDOM WE NEED,
[38:43] BRETHREN.
[38:45] WHERE SPIRITS cannot take you anywhere.
[38:49] Just dangling you. Just dangling you.
[38:54] Spirit's coming to tell you.
[38:57] You see, you don't have money.
[39:01] Go and gamble, you get money.
[39:04] And then you also say, "Yes, sir."
[39:06] And then you go and do it. YOU SEE THIS
[39:09] MAD MAN here in this place in the He had
[39:12] to obey whatever the spirit say
[39:17] the chains. He said yes sir. And he
[39:20] tears THE CHAIN. WHEN HE SAYS GO AND
[39:23] BEAT PEOPLE, HE SAYS YES SIR.
[39:27] YOU HAVE seen many people around.
[39:30] They can decide to chase you.
[39:33] That is a SPIRIT TELLING HIM. CHASE THAT
[39:36] ONE. CATCH HIM. PRAISE THE LORD. A DEMON
[39:40] TELLING YOU PICK PAPERS
[39:42] PUT ON YOUR BODY. THAT'S HOW MAD MEN
[39:45] BEHAVE. THEY DISOBEY EVERY SPIRIT.
[39:49] BRETHREN, we should not do that. WE
[39:51] SHOULD BE CHILDREN OF FREEDOM. WHEREBY
[39:54] WE HAVE AUTHORITY
[39:56] TO TELL THE DEVIL. You a liar. You can't
[39:59] have opportunity over me.
[40:02] I'M A CHILD OF GOD. I've been set free.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[40:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN. NOW THIS MAN HERE WHO LIVED UNDER
[40:09] THE tombs
[40:12] day after day the Bible say day and
[40:14] night he had no freedom just crying
[40:19] having no no hopes whether tomorrow will
[40:23] wake up well
[40:25] maybe the demons could give him small
[40:27] freedom to sleep
[40:31] and when he's sleeping
[40:34] maybe if I wake up I'll be fine
[40:37] So he wakes up. The body is still need
[40:40] to be cut.
[40:42] No freedom at all.
[40:45] This man had no freedom.
[40:48] He desired freedom.
[40:50] But he COULDN'T GET IT
[40:52] UNTIL there was one
[40:55] who came from the ship
[40:58] by the name the Lord Jesus Christ.
[41:01] WHEN HE CAME INTO the place,
[41:03] tell your brother, no spirit could
[41:06] stand.
[41:09] All the unclean spirits
[41:12] had to tremble
[41:14] because the princess was no longer the
[41:16] same.
[41:19] The atmosphere was different.
[41:21] Sins were no LONGER THE SAME. DEMONS
[41:24] WERE HAVING FREEDOM TO TORMENT THIS MAN.
[41:28] AND KNOW JESUS CHRIST
[41:30] AND COME INTO the place. The devil has
[41:33] no authority.
[41:35] The devil was just trembling
[41:37] and he was trembling speaking to him
[41:43] and he said,
[41:45] &gt;&gt; but when HE SAW JESUS A FAR OFF,
[41:50] he ran and worship worshiped him
[41:53] and cried with a loud voice
[41:56] &gt;&gt; and said, "What I what have I to do with
[42:00] thee,
[42:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus?" Yes, those son of the most high
[42:06] God.
[42:08] The demons were just NOW BEGGING
[42:10] SOMEONE WHO have authority as a child of
[42:12] God.
[42:15] The demons are just saying
[42:17] those hand out of God.
[42:21] I deserve thee by God
[42:24] that thou torment me not.
[42:27] Then you TELL THE DEMON, "GET GET OUT OF
[42:30] ME, THEREFORE,
[42:32] GET OUT OF my way
[42:34] and let me continue."
[42:37] Jesus Christ
[42:38] &gt;&gt; had a mission somewhere.
[42:41] BUT ALONG THE WAY, DEMONS WERE opposing
[42:44] the area.
[42:46] But where Jesus HAD TO PASS,
[42:49] EVERY SPIRIT HAD TO CLEAN AWAY. ALL OF
[42:52] THEM HAD TO RUN AWAY BECAUSE TRUE
[42:54] HOLINESS WAS PASSING THEM.
[42:57] TRUE FREEDOM WAS PASSING BY AND NO DEMON
[43:00] COULD STAND IT. PRAISE THE LORD. Because
[43:03] the atmosphere
[43:05] was no longer the same. When you HAVE
[43:07] TRUE FREEDOM, THE ATMOSPHERE
[43:11] IS NOT THE SAME AS YOU DO NOT HAVE
[43:13] FREEDOM.
[43:18] Praise the Lord. You walk as in Christ,
[43:22] not as a person who has fallen.
[43:25] Praise the Lord.
[43:27] That is how the demons cried.
[43:31] Son of the most high God, I rejected by
[43:34] the by God.
[43:36] Though torment me not, FOR HE'S SIDE
[43:39] UNTO HIM,
[43:41] COME OUT OF HIM, UNCLEAN SPIRIT. JESUS,
[43:45] YES,
[43:46] &gt;&gt; never had time to play with a demon and
[43:50] tell him, "How did you come to me?
[43:53] When did you come to heal?
[43:56] How did you access him?
[43:59] BY which what MEANS HE COME?
[44:02] JESUS NEVER HAD A TIME.
[44:05] He only had a time to say
[44:08] come out of him. Do not negotiate with
[44:10] demons.
[44:12] The moment YOU GIVE THE DEVIL
[44:13] OPPORTUNITY,
[44:15] SMALL OPPORTUNITY like this to negotiate
[44:18] with him,
[44:20] I do it or I don't do it.
[44:22] The prophet says, "Do not waste your
[44:25] time to debate." If something is not
[44:28] right,
[44:29] just leave it and continue.
[44:33] Cut it out of you that you may have
[44:36] freedom. Praise the Lord. This demon
[44:41] tried to torment this man. A man who
[44:44] also live desired a life like ours.
[44:48] But the devils were trying to come to
[44:50] him.
[44:51] But Jesus came and said, "Come out, come
[44:54] out of the man, th unclean spirit." And
[44:58] he answered him, "What is thy name?" And
[45:02] he answered, saying, "My name is Legion,
[45:06] for we are many."
[45:09] And being, he besought him much that he
[45:13] would not send them away out of the
[45:15] country.
[45:19] Praise the Lord. It was now demons that
[45:21] were trying to struggle.
[45:24] But at least even if you want to send us
[45:27] out
[45:29] this country here,
[45:31] we still need it to send us out out of
[45:34] this country.
[45:37] It means brother
[45:40] as much as they cast away spirit from a
[45:42] person
[45:44] from one district
[45:47] does not mean that
[45:49] demons have left all people.
[45:52] Demons will continue living around
[45:56] simply cast away from one person.
[46:00] For them they continue operating for
[46:02] others.
[46:03] Now this man was alone. He's the only
[46:06] one who desired freedom at that moment
[46:10] because his LIFE WAS IN TORMENT.
[46:13] HE NEEDED TRUE FREEDOM. BUT CHRIST CAME
[46:15] AND set him free and he was free indeed.
[46:20] Praise the Lord. You need your life to
[46:22] be free. My brother, my sister,
[46:25] when you're free,
[46:28] Christ will always dwell in you and you
[46:31] have authority over everything.
[46:34] Sorry, my phone is going off. Let me
[46:36] open from here.
[46:40] Mark 5, we end verse
[46:50] verse 11
[46:53] because in verse 10
[46:56] it says that
[47:00] he besought him
[47:04] much that he would not send them away
[47:07] out of the country.
[47:10] Now there was there is nine
[47:13] unto the mountains
[47:17] a great herd of swine feeding swine
[47:20] feeding.
[47:22] Those are the pigs.
[47:24] AND ALL THE DEVILS BESOUGHT HIM,
[47:27] SAYING, "Send us unto the strength
[47:31] that we may enter into them."
[47:34] And for we Jesus gave them leave
[47:39] and the unclean spirit went out.
[47:42] Remember in the beginning the Bible
[47:45] talks about unclean spirit.
[47:48] But now here we are seeing unclean
[47:50] spirits.
[47:52] Meaning these demons were many.
[47:56] They were all possessing this man.
[47:58] They were all HAVING CONTROL OVER HIM.
[48:01] THAT'S WHY WE SAID EARLIER on every
[48:04] demon HAD A RIGHT TO SAY DO this and a
[48:07] man could do that was a different demon.
[48:10] When a demon say go and kill that person
[48:14] and he was able to obey, that was a
[48:16] demon of murder. WHEN THE DEMON SAID GO
[48:19] AND CHASE THOSE PEOPLE THAT WAS A DEMON
[48:22] OF the demon which you could NOT BE
[48:23] RULED.
[48:25] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. These demons were many.
[48:28] Praise the Lord. Brother, SISTER, WHEN
[48:31] YOU ALLOW ACCESS OF one demon to your
[48:33] life,
[48:35] just know that THERE'S A POSSIBILITY OF
[48:37] MANY DEMONS COMING AFTER YOU.
[48:41] Let me give an example of a drunk PERSON
[48:44] STAGGERING AROUND the Lord. He thinks
[48:46] that the road all is.
[48:49] EVEN WHEN A car comes, HE WILL TELL A
[48:51] CAR PASS THERE BECAUSE HE THINKS IN HIS
[48:54] MIND ALL THE ROAD IS HIS. IN THE
[48:58] BEGINNING, it was A SPIRIT OF
[49:00] DRUNKARDNESS.
[49:02] NOW, THE SPIRITS ARE NOW MANIFESTING
[49:04] THEMSELVES.
[49:06] THE ARROGANT SPIRIT IS SAYING
[49:08] pass there, destroy his mind. WHEN A
[49:12] WOMAN PASSES, YOU COME HERE. THAT IS NOT
[49:15] A SPIRIT SPEAKING IN HIM. THAT IS NOT A
[49:18] SPIRIT OF ADULTERY OR FORNICATION.
[49:21] THAT IS HOW SPIRIT CAN ACCESS YOUR LIFE.
[49:24] TRY TO have dominion over you. THEY TRY
[49:27] TO HAVE CONTROL OVER YOU, TRY TO
[49:30] DOMINATE YOU and they want CONTROL OF
[49:33] YOU, TELL YOU WHATSOEVER THEY DESIRE.
[49:37] WHEN ONE SPIRIT COMES UPON YOU,
[49:40] UNCLEAN SPIRIT, many many more spirits
[49:43] come
[49:45] because the house is theirs.
[49:48] The spirit over that will say, "Let me
[49:51] first go and pick a spirit of
[49:52] drunkenness.
[49:55] That might be my visa today."
[49:58] And the spirit of drunkenness comes.
[50:00] Then he said, "No, we need even the
[50:03] spirit of safety or stealing.
[50:05] LET'S GO AND INVITE HIM ALSO. IT IS OUR
[50:08] HOUSE. They having dominion. They have a
[50:11] right TO INVITE EVERY SPIRIT TO COME
[50:14] OVER YOU. BROTHER, SISTER, you must
[50:17] identify yourself
[50:19] &gt;&gt; to be with Christ. Don't allow spirits
[50:21] to dominate you. Praise the Lord. Now
[50:27] &gt;&gt; the spirits
[50:29] after having control over this man,
[50:32] &gt;&gt; Jesus cast them out and they went out
[50:36] and entered into the pigs AND VIOLENTLY
[50:39] DOWN A STEEP AND THOSE RAN violently
[50:43] down a steep place into the sea.
[50:49] I wonder about this part which we are
[50:50] going to read.
[50:53] There were about 2,000
[50:55] pigs
[51:01] &gt;&gt; and were chocked in the sea.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; 2,000 pigs.
[51:07] [clears throat] How many demons were in
[51:08] this man?
[51:13] If they were all cast away,
[51:16] how many were they?
[51:20] We have seen 2,000.
[51:22] ALL OF THEM THEY RAN
[51:25] ONE AFTER THE OTHER PIG. ALL THE SPIRITS
[51:29] THAT WERE INVITED in they were all
[51:32] coming out.
[51:34] All the spirits of uncleanness,
[51:37] they were all coming out,
[51:40] the works of the flesh, they were not
[51:42] running away because Christ had come to
[51:45] set him free.
[51:48] Demons were very many. ALL THE PIGS HAD
[51:50] TO SUFFER the pain.
[51:54] And they that fed the swing FLED
[51:57] AND TOLD it in the city.
[52:03] And they went out to see what was that
[52:06] was done.
[52:08] Now listen here. And they come to Jesus
[52:12] and see that was AND AND SEE HIM THAT
[52:15] WAS POSSESSED with the devil
[52:19] and had a legion
[52:22] sitting and closed
[52:24] &gt;&gt; and in his right mind
[52:26] and they were afraid. Praise the Lord.
[52:30] People of the world don't care
[52:33] whether you've given your life to
[52:35] Christ. They are still afraid of you.
[52:39] There's anything that you can steal
[52:42] if Christ saved you from safety.
[52:46] They still THINK THAT YOU'RE THE SAME
[52:48] OLD man
[52:51] who likes things of the world.
[52:54] They will still be afraid.
[52:56] Has he really given his life to Christ?
[52:59] Is it really true? He will go to the
[53:02] neighbor. I hear Emma has given his life
[53:04] to Christ
[53:07] according to you. Is it true?
[53:09] We should be careful. They just not
[53:12] allow him anyhow in yet
[53:15] because anything can happen. Man might
[53:18] CHANGE AGAIN. THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT
[53:20] BELIEVING
[53:22] WHAT CHRIST HAD DONE. PRAISE THE LORD.
[53:26] BUT IT ONLY TAKES a true identity of
[53:29] freedom.
[53:31] Only in you who has been set free.
[53:34] Only you. YOU, YOU, BROTHER, SISTER. IT
[53:37] IS ONLY YOU WHO KNOWS, I'VE BEEN
[53:40] LIBERATED FROM SIN. I'M NO LONGER a
[53:42] slave of sin. IT IS YOU WHO KNOWS CHRIST
[53:46] HAS SET ME FREE. WHEN WE CONTINUE
[53:48] READING ABOUT THIS MAN, HE WENT ON
[53:50] TELLING PEOPLE, IT IS CHRIST WHO SET ME
[53:53] FREE. PRAISE THE LORD. HE WAS NOW
[53:56] PREACHING THE GOOD NEWS, TELLING THE
[53:58] PEOPLE, THE ONE WHO SET HIM FREE.
[54:01] Has other people were still murmuring.
[54:04] Who is this man here? Our pigs. See our
[54:08] pigs have gone to the sea.
[54:10] THIS MAN HAS DONE IT BAD. THEY WERE
[54:13] HATING the Lord Jesus Christ. They were
[54:15] not happy for what HAS HAPPENED BECAUSE
[54:18] THE SAME DEMONS THAT WERE IN THIS MAN
[54:21] WERE NOW SCATTERED AROUND THE COUNTRY.
[54:24] THEY NOW DOMINATED the men around. They
[54:26] had now possessed those people and those
[54:29] people were now having those demons.
[54:31] Each one identifying this demon in him.
[54:35] Some are saying THIS MAN HERE LET HIM GO
[54:37] OUT OF OUR COUNTRY ARE FAR OUT FROM OUR
[54:40] COUNTRY IS THEY SAID IT from the Bible
[54:42] here. HE SHOULD BE HE SHOULD GO OUT FROM
[54:46] THIS COUNTRY.
[54:47] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CAUSED TROUBLE. All our pigs are
[54:51] gone.
[54:53] They were no longer people who were
[54:55] living a life of happiness.
[55:00] You see that one of their own has been
[55:01] set free.
[55:04] Instead, they were sending away the one
[55:06] who set that man free away.
[55:10] The Bible says, "And they come to Jesus
[55:13] and see HIM THAT WAS POSSESSED WITH THE
[55:15] devil
[55:17] and had a legion
[55:21] and he had a legion
[55:24] sitting and clothed."
[55:26] This man was given also nice clothes to
[55:28] put on. Perhaps maybe the the the
[55:31] apostles gave him
[55:33] after he was set free because all demon
[55:36] possessed people.
[55:38] I mean physically demons possess people.
[55:41] There are people many people are demon
[55:43] possessed.
[55:46] Though they are not manifesting as other
[55:48] people manifest
[55:51] but people are possessed with demons.
[55:54] Don't assume. Don't assume
[55:58] my friend so and so doesn't do this
[56:02] so I can go with him.
[56:05] For him, he doesn't like these things of
[56:06] fornication.
[56:08] He doesn't like the things of doesn't
[56:10] like these things of God.
[56:12] So I can GO WITH HIM.
[56:15] BUT AS YOU MOVE WITH HIM, THE
[56:17] MANIFESTATION OF those spirits,
[56:20] unclean spirits will begin to manifest.
[56:25] If he doesn't like girls,
[56:27] he will take you into direction of
[56:29] things that he likes.
[56:32] Brother, they even like calling you
[56:34] brother SO AND SO. YOU ALSO TAKE A
[56:37] little
[56:38] just a little
[56:40] here. Just a little doesn't make you
[56:43] even like us.
[56:47] Now for you who who knew
[56:51] only one thing that your friend does not
[56:53] do
[56:54] has now fallen into a trap.
[56:57] Praise the Lord. Demons can try people
[57:01] and can take people very far. Sin can
[57:05] TAKE YOU FAR THAN YOU EXPECT.
[57:09] AND THEY THAT saw it told them how it
[57:13] befell to him that was possessed with
[57:15] the devil. and also concerning the
[57:17] swing.
[57:25] This is verse 17 of the Bible says, "And
[57:28] they began to pray to him
[57:32] to depart out of their cost.
[57:36] They no longer wanted Jesus to be there
[57:40] because their spirits were not matching.
[57:43] Jesus was on the mission
[57:46] had finished to do his work.
[57:49] It was now time to continue ahead.
[57:52] Whether men accept Christ,
[57:54] whether they don't accept Christ,
[57:57] brother, sister, continue ahead, move on
[58:00] with your salvation.
[58:03] You don't need to be gloomy
[58:06] that even so and so has refused. My good
[58:09] friend has refused.
[58:11] How can I continue living without him
[58:14] or without her? When Christ finished the
[58:17] work there, he had to continue.
[58:21] Praise the Lord has led by the spirit
[58:24] of God in him. AND WHEN HE WAS COME INTO
[58:28] the the ship
[58:31] that HE HAD, HE THAT HAD BEEN POSSESSED
[58:34] WITH THE DEVIL prayed him that he might
[58:36] be with him.
[58:44] How be Jesus suffered him not
[58:48] but saith unto him.
[58:51] &gt;&gt; Go home to thy friends.
[58:55] And tell THEM HOW GREAT THINGS THE LORD
[58:58] HAS done for thee
[59:02] and has had compassion on you.
[59:06] Even when no one had compassion over
[59:08] this man,
[59:11] Jesus had compassion over him. Jesus had
[59:14] freedom over for him. EVERYTHING WAS IN
[59:17] HIM. JESUS CHRIST CAME WITH A FULL
[59:19] PACKAGE. And even his apostles were
[59:22] carrying a spare clothes.
[59:25] They gave him. He was now a clean man.
[59:29] Now going outside there preaching the
[59:32] gospel of good news. Now that you given
[59:35] YOUR LIFE TO CHRIST,
[59:36] YOU OUGHT TO TELL SOMEBODY ABOUT THE
[59:39] FREEDOM THAT YOU HAVE. THE TRUE FREEDOM
[59:42] THAT YOU HAVE MUST BE KNOWN TO EACH AND
[59:44] everyone that they may either be set
[59:47] free
[59:49] or fall into bondage because IF THEY
[59:52] ACCEPT IT, THEY WILL BE SET FREE AND
[59:55] THEY'LL BE FREE INDEED. and he DEPARTED
[59:59] &gt;&gt; AND BEGAN TO PUBLISH IN THE IN the And
[1:00:03] he began to publish in the police HOW
[1:00:07] GREAT THINGS JESUS HAD DONE for him.
[1:00:12] It was now publishing.
[1:00:16] It was now to publish. Praise the Lord.
[1:00:20] I do printing.
[1:00:22] And when we talk about publishing,
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; it means a lot.
[1:00:27] It goes very far
[1:00:30] to publish a newspaper.
[1:00:33] It goes all over Uganda.
[1:00:35] This man was working tirelessly
[1:00:39] to publish the great things that Jesus
[1:00:40] had done for him
[1:00:43] and all men did marvel.
[1:00:46] AND WHEN JESUS WAS PASSED OVER AGAIN BY
[1:00:49] the sheep in unto the other side,
[1:00:53] much people gathered unto him.
[1:00:58] AND IT WAS NIGH unto unto the sea.
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Now Jesus
[1:01:06] setting men free.
[1:01:08] He went even over the other side. The
[1:01:11] Bible says immediately reached there.
[1:01:14] There was a one ruler of the synagogue,
[1:01:17] Gyrus by name. And when he saw him, he
[1:01:21] fell at his feet and besought to him
[1:01:24] greatly,
[1:01:25] saying, My little daughter life at the
[1:01:27] point of death,
[1:01:29] I pray thee, come and lay thy hands on
[1:01:31] her,
[1:01:33] that she may be healed,
[1:01:36] and she shall live." And Jesus went to
[1:01:39] him, and went and and much people
[1:01:41] followed him
[1:01:43] and thrown him. and a certain woman
[1:01:48] which had an issue of blood. SO THINGS
[1:01:50] WERE JUST CONTINUOUSLY HAPPENING.
[1:01:54] Freedom after freedom.
[1:01:56] Praise the Lord. Jesus Christ
[1:02:00] who is in you is now moving in you
[1:02:04] setting men free
[1:02:06] and making THEM FREE.
[1:02:08] JESUS WAS ON mission to set everyone
[1:02:11] free
[1:02:13] to obtain true freedom. Praise the Lord.
[1:02:17] Now, true freedom cannot be imagined.
[1:02:21] True freedom
[1:02:24] &gt;&gt; cannot be imagined.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; I want us read some quotes here as we
[1:02:28] close.
[1:02:30] I pray that my power will help me. Amen.
[1:02:35] The Bible I mean we are going to read
[1:02:36] from mean this quote here.
[1:02:41] Allow me get it.
[1:02:49] Praise the Lord.
[1:02:52] uh we are getting from uh that book uh I
[1:02:56] mean from that ceremony the believer's
[1:02:58] position in Christ
[1:03:02] we just going to narrate something
[1:03:03] little about Moses
[1:03:06] that the prophet talked about
[1:03:09] and that verse seven paragraph seven I
[1:03:12] mean
[1:03:16] then Moses lost all the hope
[1:03:21] and the power that he had.
[1:03:23] &gt;&gt; Thinking that
[1:03:25] freedom wasn't for the children of
[1:03:27] Israel,
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; he had lost all the souls of freedom
[1:03:33] till God met met one day met him one day
[1:03:38] in a burning bush.
[1:03:42] And then when God's season came along
[1:03:45] just exactly
[1:03:49] He revealed his plans to Moses.
[1:03:53] What I what the prophet here is speaking
[1:03:56] was Moses in his own way trying to
[1:04:00] create freedom and liberty to the
[1:04:02] children of Israel.
[1:04:05] When things got hot,
[1:04:08] he had to flee and he lost holy hope.
[1:04:12] Now the reason that Moses had forgotten
[1:04:14] about the freedom
[1:04:18] God promised that he would free them.
[1:04:24] But God hasn't forgotten his promise.
[1:04:28] Moses tried in himself
[1:04:32] and failed.
[1:04:34] That is what the church has done many
[1:04:35] times.
[1:04:38] We have tried
[1:04:41] in ourselves to do things
[1:04:45] when we fail to find God's element of
[1:04:47] time.
[1:04:50] Brother, sister, freedom has an element
[1:04:53] of time.
[1:04:56] You cannot forge things out.
[1:04:59] You cannot camouflage.
[1:05:02] You cannot try them on your own
[1:05:04] just like Moses tried.
[1:05:07] It takes God's time,
[1:05:09] God's appointed time
[1:05:12] to come and set you free.
[1:05:14] If there be any bondage,
[1:05:17] either your family member or your friend
[1:05:21] or yourself is going through, wait on
[1:05:25] God. He will set you free. Praise the
[1:05:29] Lord. Don't fudge it out yourself.
[1:05:36] Paragraph 10 says, "So then when Moses
[1:05:41] find out now
[1:05:43] the real direct will OF GOD
[1:05:46] AND THE TIME of God and the revelation
[1:05:50] of everything to do
[1:05:52] now to TRY TO KEEP HIM OUT OF EGYPT."
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; Now
[1:06:01] try to keep him out of Egypt.
[1:06:07] Right back to Egypt.
[1:06:09] Right back to Egypt.
[1:06:14] He went just as hard as he could to go
[1:06:20] for he knew that God had promised
[1:06:22] deliverance
[1:06:24] and the time had come for deliverance
[1:06:28] for it was directly.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:06:33] When it is God's time,
[1:06:37] you go with liberty.
[1:06:39] If there be an opposed person in your
[1:06:41] family
[1:06:43] and you really true that you have
[1:06:45] freedom,
[1:06:47] you will match that person
[1:06:49] with true identity of Christ in you
[1:06:52] with THE FULL AUTHORITY
[1:06:55] WITH ALL THE FREEDOM AND YOU GO AND
[1:06:57] SPEAK TO THAT demon in your relative IN
[1:07:01] YOUR FRIEND'S LIFE.
[1:07:03] BE CAST OUT IN THE NAME of the Lord
[1:07:06] JESUS CHRIST. YOU'LL WALK WITH
[1:07:08] CONFIDENCE.
[1:07:10] Not with fear.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord because you KNOW WHO YOU
[1:07:14] ARE, YOUR position in Christ. Praise the
[1:07:17] Lord. Now Moses was looking first at the
[1:07:20] word.
[1:07:22] The word of God HAD PROMISED THEM
[1:07:25] DELIVERANCE.
[1:07:27] MOSES WENT TO search scriptures.
[1:07:30] God promised the children of Israel
[1:07:32] freedom. AT ONE POINT THEY WOULD COME
[1:07:34] BACK TO THEIR PROMISED LAND. MOSES WAS
[1:07:37] SEARCHING SCRIPTURES.
[1:07:39] AND HE FOUND IT RIGHT THERE. HE KNEW
[1:07:42] THAT WAS GOD'S STAYING
[1:07:44] AND HE COULDN'T MOVE ANY INCH TO REFUSE
[1:07:47] TO GO there to set the children of
[1:07:49] Israel freedom.
[1:07:51] Praise the Lord. He had known it was a
[1:07:54] promised it WAS PRO GOD HAD promised
[1:07:58] them deliverance.
[1:08:01] He knew the TIME WAS NIGH.
[1:08:04] Now he had to have a direct CONTACT WITH
[1:08:07] GOD.
[1:08:12] AND WHEN TO DO IT. WHEN YOU HAVE
[1:08:15] FREEDOM,
[1:08:16] you know how and when to do it. You
[1:08:20] don't just you don't gamble. You don't
[1:08:23] just gamble.
[1:08:25] Today these demons let me come over you.
[1:08:28] Demons will will beat you. I mean they
[1:08:31] will kick you because you don't know
[1:08:33] your position.
[1:08:35] Praise the Lord. Now that WAS A TIME IT
[1:08:39] HAD come
[1:08:41] and I think of Moses how that Moses
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; standing up there on the mount by the
[1:08:50] side of this burning bush.
[1:08:54] He had lost all hopes of freedom.
[1:08:58] It didn't seem like that the freedom
[1:09:01] that it didn't seem that the freedom
[1:09:03] that the people he so gallantly stood
[1:09:08] for stood for one time was ever going to
[1:09:13] happen.
[1:09:20] But in the light of God
[1:09:23] standing by the by that burning bush,
[1:09:28] everything in him changed.
[1:09:30] All the attitude changed,
[1:09:33] the behavior changed, the mindset
[1:09:35] changed, everything in Moses
[1:09:39] was working out itself.
[1:09:43] Not by Moses himself,
[1:09:46] but God in the mountain there
[1:09:48] before the burning bush.
[1:09:51] was speaking to Moses. God was
[1:09:53] relocating his his body. HE WAS PUTTING
[1:09:56] HIS MIND into a right state
[1:09:59] to accept freedom for the children of
[1:10:02] Israel.
[1:10:04] Moses had to believe freedom first
[1:10:10] before he could go and proclaim freedom.
[1:10:14] You cannot go and tell the people of the
[1:10:15] world freedom
[1:10:18] when you yourself does not have freedom.
[1:10:20] It is practically impossible.
[1:10:23] PRAISE THE LORD. YOU must have an
[1:10:25] identity in you.
[1:10:28] Christ working in you and then
[1:10:30] afterwards you have freedom to go out to
[1:10:34] speak to them THAT YOU ARE FREE INDEED.
[1:10:39] PRAISE THE LORD. THAT IS WHAT WAS
[1:10:41] HAPPENING TO MOSES HERE.
[1:10:43] MOSES WAS now understanding
[1:10:46] that this was the time and was need the
[1:10:49] time for them to go and and bring the
[1:10:51] children out of bondage.
[1:10:54] If the sinner could only see that
[1:10:58] if the sinner would only hear the true
[1:11:00] gospel,
[1:11:03] not the joining of the churches,
[1:11:06] but the preaching of the gospel
[1:11:08] that you can be free from sin.
[1:11:12] PRAISE THE LORD THAT YOU CAN BE FREE
[1:11:15] FROM YOUR SICKNESS.
[1:11:18] AT A CERTAIN TIME
[1:11:20] THAT is a time you believe.
[1:11:25] You know those slaves were so excited.
[1:11:30] THOSE SLAVES WERE SO EXCITE WERE SO
[1:11:32] excited
[1:11:35] and such anticipation
[1:11:39] waiting for our that they would be free.
[1:11:45] The prophet was trying to narrate a
[1:11:46] story here
[1:11:48] about the slaves who were waiting for
[1:11:51] freedom
[1:11:53] because freedom was allocated for them
[1:11:55] at second time.
[1:11:59] Praise the Lord that they will gather at
[1:12:01] the bottom of the of the hill.
[1:12:06] Mothers and little children
[1:12:09] all gathered and some of them the old
[1:12:13] and they were climbed UP TO THE TOP OF
[1:12:15] THE HILL
[1:12:17] AROUND MIDNIGHT.
[1:12:20] They known when THE DAY BREAK AND THE
[1:12:22] SUN COME up
[1:12:27] that THEY WOULD BE FREE.
[1:12:30] IT WOULDN'T TAKE OVER ONE half of the
[1:12:33] minute to shine the sun from the top of
[1:12:35] the hill.
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; They were JUST WAITING FOR THE SUN TO
[1:12:46] come
[1:12:48] and then they would be free until they
[1:12:51] couldn't wait any longer.
[1:12:53] Some people had to climb on top of the
[1:12:55] mountain
[1:12:56] to wait to see the sun.
[1:12:58] Is it coming? Is it? Where has it
[1:13:01] reached? AND THEN THEY SHOUT FREEDOM.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. And then even people
[1:13:07] down THE HILL THERE WOULD SHOUT FREEDOM
[1:13:11] BECAUSE FREEDOM HAD COME UPON THEM. This
[1:13:14] was a story of the the the slaves.
[1:13:18] PRAISE THE LORD. That was so for those
[1:13:21] people. They were so excited
[1:13:25] to see freedom. But when the sun rises
[1:13:28] one of these days
[1:13:31] and the sun rose some 1900 years ago,
[1:13:38] he broke every slave, every slave belt.
[1:13:44] He set every captive free.
[1:13:48] He heal EVERY SICKNESS.
[1:13:50] HE GAVE FREEDOM TO THOSE WHO ARE IN
[1:13:53] BONDAGE.
[1:13:55] HOW WE OUGHT to climb
[1:13:59] and watch
[1:14:01] and see our freedom coming.
[1:14:03] The freedom whereby we shall no longer
[1:14:06] see the things of this world.
[1:14:09] How much glad shall we be? Brethren
[1:14:12] when THE FREEDOM COMES WHERE THERE WILL
[1:14:14] BE NO MORE SIN.
[1:14:16] THERE WILL BE NO more no more sorrow.
[1:14:20] Nothing more to worry. We shall be in
[1:14:22] glory just serving God and praising our
[1:14:26] father. RIGHT NOW WE ARE PEEPING.
[1:14:30] WE ARE WAITING FOR THE COMING OF THE
[1:14:32] LORD. WE ARE PRAYING. WE ARE WATCHING
[1:14:36] and we are gladly expecting HIM TO COME.
[1:14:39] WHEN HE COMES BROTHER, SISTER, FREEDOM
[1:14:42] WILL BE IN ITS FULLNESS.
[1:14:44] THERE WILL BE NO TEMPTATION,
[1:14:47] NO SIN,
[1:14:49] NOTHING ANYMORE. YOU RECEIVE ALL YOUR
[1:14:51] TRUE IDENTITY
[1:14:53] AND God will say
[1:14:56] well done my servant.
[1:14:59] God will not say again. How did you
[1:15:02] overcome the other?
[1:15:05] That will be our testimony TO SPEAK. THE
[1:15:07] FIRST THING JESUS WILL SAY WELL DONE MY
[1:15:10] SERVANT. YOU FAITHFUL SERVANT BECAUSE
[1:15:14] YOU HAVE DONE IT RIGHT. This is your
[1:15:16] sight to be in glory WITH THE FATHER.
[1:15:20] THERE WILL BE LIBERTY. There will be
[1:15:22] FULL FREEDOM. NO SIN ANYMORE. NOT AGAIN
[1:15:26] wondering if I wake up tomorrow. Will I
[1:15:30] manage to get transport to go to school?
[1:15:33] School days will be done. Brother
[1:15:36] going to the clinic will be no more.
[1:15:40] seeking for the sins of the world will
[1:15:42] be no more
[1:15:44] because you would have passed from this
[1:15:46] life to the other life
[1:15:48] where Christ himself is our king.
[1:15:52] We shall be just worshiping him right
[1:15:55] now. We may not have enough time to
[1:15:56] worship God
[1:15:58] as much as we are seeking for that time
[1:16:01] because many things around the world
[1:16:04] are occupying our time.
[1:16:07] But brother, sister
[1:16:09] When you stay on the Lord, wait on God,
[1:16:12] there will come a time when you will not
[1:16:15] be doing anything
[1:16:17] serving God only,
[1:16:20] just giving him glory,
[1:16:22] just serving God in his fullness
[1:16:25] and God will be with you. May the Lord
[1:16:28] bless you as we stand up. Praise the
[1:16:31] Lord. I request brother Shalom to come
[1:16:34] and sing the same song that we were
[1:16:37] singing when we began the sermon.
[1:16:40] Shalom. I hope we are blessed.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:16:44] &gt;&gt; By the way, I have a testimony.
[1:16:47] Before [clears throat] we can sing.
[1:16:49] Standing in the pp is not easy.
[1:16:53] The preachers know it
[1:16:55] and especially we young people. standing
[1:16:58] before a new people that you have not
[1:17:00] been standing before.
[1:17:03] You have that kind of fear.
[1:17:05] You feel like maybe they know it all.
[1:17:09] Maybe I'm preaching what they know
[1:17:10] already.
[1:17:11] You asking yourselves. But I want to
[1:17:14] tell you brother when I was preparing
[1:17:16] this sermon.
[1:17:18] I said there's freedom. These are my
[1:17:21] brethren. I must have freedom. I must
[1:17:24] preach with freedom.
[1:17:26] Pastor even one time came to me. I said,
[1:17:29] "Brother Emma, your inspirations are
[1:17:31] good, but you fear people. You don't
[1:17:34] want to see people." I said, "Pastor,
[1:17:36] pray for me." Now God found me in this
[1:17:40] sermon. When I was searching about it, I
[1:17:44] found freedom. Now I can speak with
[1:17:47] liberty because Christ has taken over.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; May the Lord bless you,
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; brother. They sing that song. Amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, he set me free. Yes, he set me free.
[1:18:04] He broke the bond [singing]
[1:18:07] of prison for me.
[1:18:10] Glory.
[1:18:12] Oh my [singing and music]
[1:18:13] Jesus to see it. Glory to God.
[1:18:18] He set me free. Oh, he set me free.
[1:18:22] [singing and music] Yes.
