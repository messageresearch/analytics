[1:56:28] that
[1:56:31] here we have to pause the moment and go

[1:56:46] Matthew 16 verse 13.
[1:56:50] all right so we're reading

[1:56:55] Jesus came into the the cost of
[1:56:57] caisseria Philippi he asked his
[1:56:59] disciples saying whom do men say that I
[1:57:01] the son of man arm and they say some say
[1:57:03] that thou art John the Baptist some
[1:57:05] Elias and others Jeremiah saw one of the
[1:57:07] prophets he saith unto them but whom say
[1:57:09] he that I am and Simon Peter answered
[1:57:12] and said Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:57:14] the Living God and Jesus answered and
[1:57:16] said unto him blessed that thou Simon by
[1:57:18] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[1:57:20] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[1:57:22] which is in heaven and I say also unto
[1:57:25] thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I
[1:57:27] will build my church and the Gates of
[1:57:29] Hell shall not Prevail against it
[1:57:32] and I give unto thee the kids of the
[1:57:34] kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou
[1:57:36] shalt Bine on Earth shall be born in
[1:57:37] heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on
[1:57:40] Earth shall be loosed in heaven just
[1:57:42] read up to verses 19.
[1:57:48] children
[1:58:24] [Music]
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:48] foreign
[1:59:01] so this morning I'm speaking on part two
[1:59:03] of what I spoke on I think it was
[1:59:05] Wednesday or Sunday
[1:59:11] on the power of Revelation
[1:59:15] tell someone the power of Revelation
[1:59:20] I hear I will not take long again this
[1:59:24] morning maybe I'll speak for about an
[1:59:25] hour we usually here can preach even up
[1:59:28] to two hours the people here can take it
[1:59:29] in some Churches can not even go 30
[1:59:31] minutes
[1:59:34] foreign
[2:00:28] the power of Revelation
[2:00:32] Jesus comes and asks and actually this
[2:00:35] in this scripture where we read
[2:00:38] this is where the whole foundation of
[2:00:40] the church is
[2:00:42] when I say the church I don't mean the
[2:00:46] denominations
[2:00:50] this is a thing that has really confused
[2:00:52] the people in our generation
[2:00:55] they have thought that you need to be a
[2:00:58] member of a religion in order to go to
[2:01:00] heaven
[2:01:03] again but come to think of it Jesus did
[2:01:07] not begin any of this religion yes
[2:01:12] he's not the founder of the religion
[2:01:15] but Jesus when he came he came with one
[2:01:19] purpose
[2:01:28] sin is unbelief
[2:01:31] of the truth when God gives his wife
[2:01:35] and the people refuse to believe
[2:01:44] it's not small
[2:01:47] attributes
[2:01:48] of sin a river when you refuse to
[2:01:52] believe what God says in his words
[2:01:59] judge you not because of the things you
[2:02:01] did yeah
[2:02:04] because of what you refuse to believe
[2:02:09] why we are not going to heaven
[2:02:12] like the works we do already the Bible
[2:02:15] says the works of the righteousness
[2:02:26] I am not going to make it because of my
[2:02:30] works of righteousness
[2:02:44] Jesus comes in my hallway yes
[2:02:52] do the works of righteousness
[2:03:52] and so here he comes with the disciples
[2:03:55] and they ask them a very important
[2:03:58] questions
[2:04:31] Jesus Yeshua was asking the disciples
[2:04:36] for them to tell him what the people
[2:04:39] think that he is
[2:04:42] a child now please understand that Jesus
[2:04:45] was Flesh and Blood yes
[2:04:48] just like me standing before you today
[2:04:52] he was born by somebody yes
[2:04:55] they even knew their mother
[2:04:57] and he was just like foreign
[2:05:20] [Music]
[2:05:29] [Music]
[2:06:45] foreign because God is the same way
[2:06:49] God is a spirit you can't count God
[2:06:53] you cannot see his beginning
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:17] and that is
[2:08:04] through throughout the generations
[2:08:16] the Bible even says we are born in sin
[2:08:20] even if your mother and father we are
[2:08:23] married
[2:08:27] we are all Bonds in sins we are born
[2:08:30] Sinners why does the Bible say we are
[2:08:33] born inside
[2:08:41] we were shaped in the womb to come to
[2:08:44] the world
[2:08:53] we were born according to the last of
[2:08:55] the flesh
[2:08:59] we were born the way we were not
[2:09:02] supposed to be born
[2:09:05] children of God
[2:09:07] born the way we are born physically
[2:09:09] speaking
[2:09:12] who is God God is the spirit
[2:09:17] God is going to give birth to any son
[2:09:22] that son must be a word child
[2:09:27] not a flesh child secretary
[2:09:32] that is why all of us
[2:09:35] no matter what our title is
[2:09:41] born in
[2:09:43] China
[2:09:49] that is why we have to be born again
[2:09:53] born again
[2:09:59] Guru
[2:10:33] Lucifer Lucifer
[2:10:36] fought now one with Mike
[2:10:40] and Lucifer Was Defeated Lucy was thrown
[2:10:43] down to there
[2:10:45] so the bat of angels
[2:10:47] became the Battle of men
[2:10:50] when Lucifer came on Earth
[2:11:04] [Applause]
[2:11:16] what happened good Sota
[2:11:20] now it was not crawling
[2:11:23] it was like I am Charlie Charlie and the
[2:11:27] devil came in that creation
[2:11:29] then that creature came to Eve and she
[2:11:31] turned in the city another inspiration
[2:11:34] of Saturn
[2:11:37] did God say
[2:11:39] you should not eat of every tree
[2:11:53] of knowledge
[2:11:58] and she was excited
[2:12:10] so he said now you will not die
[2:12:14] and Eve ate from that tree
[2:12:18] did she
[2:12:40] what's that
[2:12:42] what did she eat yeah
[2:12:48] by the time she walked away from that
[2:12:50] creature again
[2:12:53] she had a seat
[2:12:56] the devil had introduced to her a new
[2:12:58] way
[2:13:05] that's why Cain is
[2:13:19] [Music]
[2:13:26] Jesus was the seed of the woman
[2:14:25] [Music]
[2:14:28] let me paint this to

[2:15:56] one is
[2:16:00] both of them
[2:16:03] just like my sisters
[2:16:15] when when in the in the beginning
[2:16:18] when the devil came to one of them
[2:16:22] remember this creature was working
[2:16:26] but by the time you've left
[2:16:29] she was pregnant so the question is
[2:16:37] foreign
[2:17:21] so one woman became pregnant um

[2:28:12] nowhere
[2:28:14] in the genealogies
[2:28:20] it begins with says
[2:28:23] and also in the New Testament again
[2:28:33] foreign
[2:28:35] [Music]
[2:28:48] [Music]
[2:29:14] he has revealed himself
[2:29:17] in three uh uh dispensations
[2:29:23] [Music]
[2:29:41] that is all three offices is it a set of
[2:29:45] the same God
[2:29:48] when was the son of man
[2:29:51] um
[2:29:54] one who died on Calvary oh yeah
[2:29:58] all the way
[2:30:00] and when he died he concluded his office
[2:30:10] but Jesus who was the son of man
[2:30:12] was also Son of God
[2:30:16] he's the son of God
[2:30:19] Son of God is the holy spirit
[2:30:21] dispensation
[2:31:11] you wait
[2:31:13] you when I Jesus Christ's greatest
[2:31:16] Christian Son omana of God
[2:31:21] that was a higher Revelation
[2:31:26] Peter literally said
[2:31:28] you are more than a prophet
[2:31:31] himself
[2:31:33] and then Jesus was moved yesterday you
[2:31:37] were shocked he said
[2:31:40] he said Peter Rabbit let me tell you
[2:31:42] something
[2:31:44] flesh and blood has not revealed this
[2:31:48] but my Father in Heaven
[2:31:53] Peter burn this
[2:31:57] is
[2:32:00] not Peter The Rock You know the the
[2:32:04] Catholics say
[2:32:06] The Rock was Peter always
[2:32:17] this is Saint Peter's Basilica
[2:33:13] and upon this
[2:33:16] yes
[2:33:31] himself
[2:33:44] [Music]
[2:34:44] I mean
[2:34:46] praise the name of the Lord
[2:34:49] in a few minutes I'm going to be
[2:34:51] finished
[2:34:52] it doesn't mean I'll be done I'm just
[2:34:54] going to be finished
[2:34:58] now listen
[2:35:00] the power of Revelation
[2:35:03] the true charge
[2:35:16] the true church that knows the true
[2:35:18] Revelations
[2:35:21] will know what what the Bible says
[2:35:29] Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ yes
[2:35:33] tell your neighbor Jesus Christi
[2:36:31] and everything the Bible says
[2:36:39] Bible when the Bible says a woman will
[2:36:42] not be a pastor
[2:36:44] um
[2:36:49] but why do we have women preachers today
[2:36:52] we have women preachers today
[2:36:55] because they have rejected the
[2:36:58] absolutely
[2:37:00] because we cannot debate with the Bible
[2:37:05] the women in the churches
[2:37:10] why do they wear trousers
[2:37:14] when the Bible is very clear
[2:37:18] because they have rejected
[2:37:22] why do men marry more than one women
[2:37:29] the Bible says
[2:37:39] foreign
[2:38:23] foreign
[2:38:37] why do they use father-son holy spirit
[2:38:42] that he bless the teaching of the
[2:38:44] Trinity
[2:38:48] instead of the teaching of the one true
[2:38:50] God
[2:38:52] listen they call the one true God
[2:38:56] they call him the one tree in God
