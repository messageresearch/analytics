very far uh from my second home in Ethiopia amen hallelujah so join me this morning to greet our sister ban amen if you could stand up and then you know just receive her greet her amen God bless you so much um can we just have you say God bless you to the people you can use English you very good in English Okay God bless you church I love you I came from Ethiopia I'm preacher I plan the church today I'm very happy to see you thank you so much uh as you heard she's a minister she's a preacher of the Gospel and uh she's a church planter actually her right name is apostle biran from Ethiopia and um so uh um uh one of ours uh Pastor Ephraim introduced her to me and she's been visiting Uganda I don't know for how long um so she was supposed to travel back I think a few days or weeks ago but somehow today uh the Lord has willed that she be with us here this morning amen and um brother ephra told me he's not yet shared the message with her but sister I want to tell you something and mil it we we we have a message and um by and by will be able to share that with you I'm sure this connection is not for nothing there is for something God has more in store for you for your life for your family amen expect great things amen and so uh there's a brother called Moses is he here he contacted me when he was coming oh you're the one God bless you brother mes thank you for being with us today amen and uh so uh I understand sister and brother Alex are here amen you're welcome we love you and we are so happy to I do not know why you did not give your own testimony with your P you know the custom here but all the same we receive the testimony and we are so happy that you are able to come and greet us today and I hope you um sister py used to be one of the uh uh leaders for the uh land fund team groups I hope you handed over properly to someone else but that does not mean you hand over giving as a matter of fact now that you are married to brother Al you should be uh more able to now uh be an ambassador for us and and and tell him about the vision of the church where you are from what we are doing and perhaps he can join you and and supporting us and together with the entire spe family where you now you know I was telling someone uh a man leaves his father and mother not the woman read your Bible very so you see the man who marries the woman he becomes the new father the one with responsibility but the old father is not dead he only has responsibility as shifted so I no longer have spiritual responsibility over sister PE but brother Alex you do you are accountable before godet tells us that of course along with your pastor but you see you are still our child sister peace and you need to participate in in the growth of your home as a matter of fact when young ladies get married always warm up and for things coming so we want the things to come do you all agree with me we want to see the fruits amen am but certainly we were so happy to have you marry your brother Alex join our sister church we respect them and I we know that you're well taken care of that is how it has to be when a woman marries she follows her husband tell your neighbor when a woman gets married she follows her husband that's what we believe tell your neighbor that's what we believe God bless you just I was just I just wanted to clear some air just in case PE was I just wanted to clear the a that is what we believe amen and I know I'm on the internet everybody's viewing that amen amen and so uh also I just wanted to give you one or two announcements and then we shall go to the word this morning um uh the when on this coming Wednesday we have a special uh Service uh with a guest Minister uh brother Tim do uh from Canada so I'm going to ask all of you to please come and be here the way you are now and also bring you friend this is a special service I'm sure you can sacrifice time and your transport and come don't stream come of course if you're from AR you can stream but you who are here Ina please please tell your neighbor come and be there the service will begin at 5:30 so that we can give enough time for Preparation and by six we shall be having the minister on the pit so it's a special service special Arrangement so come and be available when God sends a minister from a father which means he has prepared something special for so don't miss it come and be here amen and then on the this as I as as I announced this this uh month is going to be a blessed month a very blessed man whereby God will move and do great things for us and um

a several Brethren that follow our services from northern Ethiopia uh so the brothers who are streaming you know there's quite many people who follow the services and also I know I know of um several brothers who are in h in West n so we just send our greetings to all of you and everyone else who met joining um so this is part five part six of this subject that I've been speaking about the pattern for every true Ministry so we dealing with Matthew 24 again but we will begin reading from vers 23 ver 28 and then we shall be seated then if any man shall say unto you la here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the ver elect behold I have told you before wherefor if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret Chambers believe it [Applause] not for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth up unto the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for whatsoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered I want you to change those two words to let us read it again forever the cus of the body is there will the Eagles be gathered together amen do I have some EOS this morning God bless you you may be seated I'm just I want you to pray for me that the Lord will use me to speak to you this morning thank you uh brother for for the good sound now um for an inspiration the little subtitle will be the elect cannot be [Music] deceived you believe that but I'm speaking on the pattern for every true meaning so if you are here for your first time please feel at home relax we are uh we are called days of the voice Fellowship of The Voice or DF we have no book but the Bible we have no law but love we have no membership but Fellowship we have no Creed but Christ and we believe the blood of Jesus Christ wases us from all sin so everyone is welcome here is where we just study the word preach the word and we do not have any kind of denominational we don't have a denomination we are just Bible lovers and we are just Christians amen so tell your neighbor feel at home amen relax in the presence of the holy spirit this morning so um this morning this our subject is going to be divided or subdivided into two three parts so so that you can know where I we are headed and able to follow through so first we'll be speaking a little bit about the false anointed ones that is from vers 23 to uh about vers uh 24 where he speaks of the the the Christ and the many false Christ that shall arise and the false prophets which will s or show Great Signs that if it is possible they would even have deceived the elect but before we even continue the elect cannot be deceived because the Bible says here if it were possible and that the word if there shows that it is impossible to deceive the and then the second part will speak about the coming of the son of man and then the third part we will talk about wheresoever the carcass is body and what that signifies to us because we are the eaget that gather around the body the body word of the son of man so these are some of um some kind of deep scriptural things and terms but I want you to open your heart and so I'm going to begin quoting a certain quote in 1965 by William Bram from the message leadership and he said false prophets the Bible said in the last days there would be false prophets now Jesus said there shall arise false christs and he says not false Jesus's now nobody stands for that no nobody stand still for that but false Christ I mean here in um in in Uganda we have had some men who have come up and they said I am Jesus how many saw those videos and someone asked are you sure are you the real real one yes I am the real one I mean you just see the delusion the spirit of delusion I mean even the denominational people can't believe that they just look at someone who is czy so brother bam says here nobody stands still for that kind of false Jesus of someone else calling himself Jesus so the Bible is not saying there shall be false jesuses but is saying there shall be false Christ because Christ as we shall see means the anointed one they are anointed with the right anointing but they are false they can do signs and wonders they can do Miracles they can raise the Dead they can speak in tongues they can do miraculous things Open the Eyes of the blind the lamb can walk but the people who have that anointing are F that's what Jesus is saying here that in the end time there shall arise first Christ are you with me this morning Christ means the anointed ones tell your neighbor of Christ means the anointed on amen falely anointed falsely anointed they are anointed but they are false at the bottom of it are you following me now they will do great signs and wonders speak in times they will dance in the spirit they will preach the gospel the anointing is good we need it let me tell you I don't need to be in a church or under a Ministry which has no anointing I want to be under a Ministry or under a church that has anointing because we need it it is good but let us never Focus only on that this is not the right way for determining the false and the true Christ in our generation everyone is looking for anointing where is the anointed one where is the prophet where is the Apostle where is the man of God oh prophesy Papa where there are those things the people will go because they are looking for numbers but we are not looking for numbers we are looking for the Bride of Jesus Christ we are looking for the one that is interested in the seed of the world praise the name of the Lord so they will go and he say he gives you examples here he says Judas esar did it now has prophesied you know bam the hypocrite done all the signs every all the religious moves I want you to imagine a man let us just have a moment and rehear a little bit do you know the Bible says that Judas was the Devil Himself in John 67 71 Jesus spoke and he said I call you 12 and one of you devil brother Alan I want to imagine Judas was a devil was he called answer me was he called called right now follow me don't lose it was it called okay was he anointed if you doubt go to Matthew 10 and I can read it right Matthew 10 there are many scriptures I wanted to read today but as usual when I feel the spirit is done I get finished and when he had called unto him his 12 disciples this is Jesus he gave them power against unlean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease Hallelujah now the names of the 12 apostles are these Simon who is called Peter Andrew his brother James the son of Ze his brother Philip bolom Thomas Matthew the Publican James the son of alas whose ver four Simon the canite can you now read with me and Judas isar who also betrayed him Judas was among the 12 that were given power were given anointing to cast out demons to heal the sick all man of sickness they they were given the anointing this man was called this man had anointing so what are you talking about he was called he had anointing but he was a false preacher he was a Devil Himself and the only thing that made him be that is because he denied Jesus who is Jesus Jesus is the revealed word but because he denied the word he was a false pre but Anointed with the right Spirit called by God doesn't the Bible say many are called come on but few are chosen I ask you a question this morning are you chosen are you chosen don't be D on me now are you chosen if you are chosen you are chosen for what you are chosen to believe everywhere that comes out of the mouth of God Judas was a devil himself think about cfas kaas prophesied but yet is the one who crucified Jesus he gave him up balam you remember how balam the Bible say the spirit of God Came Upon Bal and spoke to talk about anointed people was anointed to the extent that a man a king would give him a lot of money a lot of clothes and promises for power if only he can help him to go and cast the Israelites now you can you can tell me maybe was not a true Prophet because he was not you know hearing from God I said no bam was actually hearing from God God spoke to him he would come and say God spoke to me and God told me not to cast them but you know when he goes back again because of the money because of the power because of of all these promises of the world he goes and he tries to bribe God because he was bried he thought God can be Bri false preachers will always be Bri when you give me money I will get enter the spirit and I will prophesy to you even if your business is even if your business is immoral business even if you a thief pastor you know I'm a boy I am a thief but God blessed me and I have been able to get 5 billion so I want to pay 5 million is it 5 million much more than 5 million please pray a blessing for me how many Pastors in our generation can rebuke that person and say you a sinner you need to repent or perish go with your money how many will do that now brother what kind of stealing did you kill oh you just used wisdom no Pastor I did not k no blood oh not blood that was no problem he's bribed a bribed preacher that is how was a bribed preacher he preaches what people want to hear he teaches what people are interested in but he knows what the Bible says but if he preaches what the Bible says the people will walk away from him that is a false Ministry that a true Ministry will stay with the word a true ministry will stay with the word at night during their time whether they have money or whether they are poor but I tell you brother a true ministry will stay with the word hallelujah amen I don't say the first Minister doesn't hear from God God is so generous with his anointing are you following me this morning God is very generous with his anointing you remember right in the Book of Esther there was many girls that were coming to the king and each girl as long as she came in the presence of the king she was given gifts and the King didn't like her so they took her to another house she would stay there and she would be spoiled with gifts they they are they they whatever she want but there was one woman and her name was es for her when they asked her what else do you need she said I want nothing else nothing more nothing less I only want to see the King give me the king oh give me nothing else became the bride had everything the king had es had access to the throne until the king one day he said to eser eser I will give you everything you need even to half of my I will rule with you just say what you want because es chose the King instead of the blessings and the gifts of the king we love gifts we love anointing that's good but brother when you believe the word the gifts will come when you believe the world the signs and wonders will come the true bride of Jesus Christ is not going to follow signs and wonders the true of Christ will follow the word and the signs and the Wonders will follow the bride and these signs shall follow them Mark 16 these signs shall follow not go before them praise the name of the Lord when you first start out you may not see any sign and wonder you know the first miracle I saw in my life myself I was the first miracle when I believed the devil thought he had worn over my life but when I believed and I was changed and I overcame the world and I was filled with the Holy Spirit I was the first sign to the devil the first Wonder to the devil the first Stander to the devil to prove the devil God has power I was the first miracle that I saw in my life and since then I have seen many more miral I've seen them following I've seen the sick healed I've seen the dead raed Hallelujah I have seen the sick heer what are you talking about I am saying signs and wonders will follow But first you have to follow the word you see balam was a hypocrite he had the anointing through anointing and yet he was a false preacher and we have many of those in our generation but you see you put a CA seed you put a seed it's the thing that sticks when you walk in the forest that kind of plant so if you take the seed of that plant and you also take the wheat seed and in the same bed and you power water down and anoint them they will both Rejoice they will both grow by it the same water the same Sun Shines on the just and on the unjust and the rain folds on the just and the unjust by their fruits oh my good Lord you shall know that you cannot know is it weed wheat is it cocar when it is still young that's why Jesus said don't uproot it you know the seeds of the bad s don't uproot it wait until the time of the Harvest when is the Harvest Time the Harvest time is the end time the end of the Gentile [Music] dispensation on Sunday we looked at the seven Church ages you know seven churches you know someone was asking me what does it mean was still confused if you're one of us Revelation 1:3 speak about seven churches and he he says these are seven churches in Asia and he mentions their name mentions Ephesus mentions mention mention s phia and all these seven churches they were in Asia now remember it was physically there these were cities physically there in Asia Minor here present tury those churches were there physic but God used it it wasn't meaning only those physical churches he said to John in the vision these things which are revealed to you are the things which are and which shall be here after so it was prophetic churches it was speaking about the future Church ages let me put it this way you were speaking about the ages of the future Church of Jesus Christ from the time of the Apostles to the end of time and when I say the end of time you still have that picture of the church and when I say the end of time I mean the end of the gentle churches the Rapture of the Bride I mean the time when amen the tribulation will begin because when the Rapture happens the tribulation begins God Lives the Gentiles and he goes to the Jews but I am so glad I am not hated for the tribulation I am so glad I am thinking and waiting on the rapture I am waiting on the coming of the Lord the Gentile Church ages have now finished where are we in God's timeline we are right there at L we are in the last Church the Bible says L is a church which is lukew it is not cold not hot it is in the middle Believers of our generation are in the middle they are not called they are not they are not true believers they are not false believers they in the midle but what did Jesus say because you are not cold and you are not I will spew out of my I'll SP the out of my mouth because I want you to be either cold or to be hot but the bride in the last age is hot hallelujah amen we are hallelujah oh my am may God give us red hot Christi red hot Christians who don't play around with sin and red hot Christians you don't praise the name of the Lord and so we notice we are right there at the end of the gender dispensation and the church is coming to a close and God is just collecting the wheat amen by the last Angel's message by the last day preachers after Elijah the prophet has come people talk about Elijah the prophet let me tell you in just a minute Elijah comes five times tell your neighbor Elijah comes five times Elijah came in the Old Testament Elijah the then the second time he came was in the ministry of elishah then the third time he came was in the ministry of John the then the fourth time he comes is to the Gentile church that's the fourth time he comes that last age messenger there seven stars but the last star be the Elijah to our time according to Malachi 45-6 and many other scriptures and so that Elijah when he comes amen then we see there will be another one who will come back to the Jews that will be after the rupture of the church do you understand my saying so we are no longer waiting for any message to come we have received the last message we have received the last warning from God our hearts have been turned back again to the word we are now waiting for one thing I am thinking of the Rapture sing with me in a blessed home on high when theed come on Church gathering in uhhuh oh my sing the one I Gathering it wash like snow wash like snow come on sing it with life free from sin oh I will shout I will shout hallelujah I will see when red Gathering the redeemed are going to gather the whe is going to be gathered and I know I am one of them hallelujah amen there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all flame with the father that fail at Pentecost which cleansed and made them clean it is burning now within my heart glory to his name I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of give us the words brother oh one of the come on sing it now one of oh I'm so glad I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of are you one of oh Hallelujah one of oh are you so glad I'm so glad I can say one of I am one of them I am not the only one there are people almost everywhere give me the first answer they are almost everywhere with hearts all on fire with a fire that fell at Pentecost which cleans and made them clean it is burning now within my heart Oh Glory to his name I am so glad I can say one give me the next one he says though these people may not Le no of worldly faith we don't we are not seeking to be famous no we already believe in a famous word it is the old Holy Spirit they have all received their Pentecost they baptized in Jesus name amen telling now both far and [Applause] wide that the power of Jesus is still the same today I am so glad I can say I am one of them the wheat is being gathered amen into the barn the last you know seed is being gathered and God is calling his last SE Jesus said they will come to me in that day they say Lord Lord have I not cast out Devils have not I done prophesied have not I done great things in your name he would say you workers of iniquity depart from me I never knew you God go into eternal hell that's been prepared for the devil and his angels you see what a word they are falsely anointed yes they worship in vain striving in vain why do you do that when you don't have to do it why take a substitute When Heaven is full with the genuine you don't have to do that you know they even teach people how to speak tongues that is the fults when you believe the true gospel the Bible say the son shall follow them and they shall speak in new tongues it's a gift from God you don't have to guess it you don't have to think it when God gives it to you you just speak in a new language praise the name of the Lord but we notice here speaking of false Christ now follow me closely the Bible says they will be where in the desert they will be where in the saet CH now now now today I want to go a little deep these anointed false anointed people there will be in many places one of them he mentioned is a desert and we've seen them tell people oh you know come somewhere in a desert oh Prayer Mountain we go fast for 40 days and 4 night and the power of God and then he also says there will be in secret Chambers people come Laden with problems and the man of God will tell them you need to meet me in my secret chamber so that I can deliver you the women who go for deliverance they come back pregnant what happened in the secret chamber false prophets I am so glad we don't have our man of God who is in a secret chamber who is in a desert who is in a Prayer Mountain somewhere no our message is somewhere a true man of God a true ministry will show you where truly Christ is he said I will tell you go in the desert Christ is there but don't go they will tell you go in a secret chamb but don't go but you know he continues on and it tells us where Christ is praise the name of the Lord if you have been following let me go ahead of myself a little bit on vers 28 he says whatsoever the body is the word whereever word whever the word is that is where the Eagles are gathered together where will the bride go oh my I don't know whether you understanding what I'm talking about we are not going in a desert because it's a Holy Mountain because it's a holy desert because secret chamber you know the Muslims go in in Mecca they holy place the Catholics go wrong kiss the holy man a great anointed man and others go to several other places you know some Pentecostals they know of some sacred holy mountains where they go to meet God and I'm not saying going to a lonely place to pray is bad that's okay speaking about the religious spirit of people thinking when I go to this place then I will find God I'm bringing it to your understanding that God is in one place the word the word brother asked a question where shall We Gather where is the rapture going to take place will it be in Arizona or will it be in Jefferson where should we go should we call all the people and tell them to come to days of the voice fellow is this the boat like that of Noah should we tell them to come to our headquarters and I'm sorry we have no headquarters where shall they gather there is only one place where people can gather and be sure they will be in the rapture and that place is in the word in the word of God as long as you are buried in the world then you will be in the resurrection hallelujah amen that is our above this is our above when you believe the word you will receive the spirit and you'll be born again surely you will overcome the work the problem why people don't get born again they don't get changed they reject the word when you hear the word which is the solution to your problem you don't believe it you you come and ask me Pastor how can I overcome this I am failing and I tell you go in prayer and F and ask fill with the Holy Spirit and you refuse to do it you remain the same but you see if you did what the word told you you will be changed but people reject the word now I want you to look at the second part here of Matthew 2427 for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even unto the West some sterio there so shall also the coming of the Sun be praise the name of the Lord I'd like us to look at this coming of the son of man in just a moment in Isaiah 30: 30 he says and the Lord shall cause his glorious voice to be heard and he will show the lightning down of his arm the liting down of his arm with the indignation of his anger and with the flame of a devouring [Music] fire with scattering and Tempest and hailstones now when you continue reading the Bible you will find that he speaks about two days of the Lord one was the great day of the Lord another was the Dreadful day of the Lord the great day of the Lord is when he came to die for us on the cross and in Isaiah chapter 61 he calls it the acceptable year of the Lord which is the Year of Jubilee now that that was fulfilled when Jesus came and died on the cross he declared the Year of Jubilee the year of Freedom the year of healing it was a wonderful day and there is another day coming give me the song was says a great day coming a great day that Dreadful day which is coming is going to be a sad day he's talking about hail Stones indignation of the anger of the Lord the flaming fire and you know did you get a song yes I wanted to some someone said there's a great day coming a great day coming there's a great day coming by and by when the siners when the Saints and the Sinners shall be parted right and left are you ready for the day to come give me the are you ready are you ready are you ready for the Jud are you ready are you ready are you ready for the Judgment Day there's a bright day coming a day coming there's a bright day coming by and by but it brightness shall only come to them that love the Lord are you ready for the day to come give me the next next Stan there's a sad day coming a sad day coming there's a sad day coming by when the Sina shall hear I know you know are you ready for the day to come now that day is coming it's going to be a sad day theer of the Lord the indignation of the Lord fire and fury but he says before that day comes there is going to be a glorious voice the Glorious voice of the Lord hallelujah how many have heard his voice in our generation he has spoken to us oh hallelujah hallelujah the lion has Ro the lion has Ro who is the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah his name is Jesus and he has roed in our generation through his messenger and he has given to us the message of restoration us back again to the principles of the word to the teachings of the Apostles I said the lion has who shall but prophesy praise the name of the Lord and we see the Bible also in the Book of Malachi chapter chapter one chapter five rather he he says these words chapter four excuse me verse one he says for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sa the Lord of that shall leave them nether root no branch that day is coming don't be deceived when I tell you Christ is here Christ is there Christ is coming and it's going to be a dreadful day but before he comes here what he says but unto you oh glory god sister Joan that is me you should be able to say that is me unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings the son of righteousness has already shown upon us is the old time Holy Spirit and the devil go near oh my today I'm full of songs and the devil that's why the devil fear come on give it to me brother but it's good enough for me give me that old time religion give me that old time religion give me that oh give me the first answer it's the old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near that's the reason people fear but it's good enough unto you that fear my name shall the son of righteousness arise with healing oh brother I tell you I was sick give me the next answer hallelujah oh my I was sick with lying I was sick with fear I was sick with sin I was sick but you know what the son of righteousness the message of the hour when it arose upon my life all my immorality all my life amen the devil flew away because the son of righteousness has arisen upon my life with healing in his wings hallelujah amen and how did that happen bys five and vers amen yes why does it say everybody one 2 3 go oh no that is very weak that's a religious reading huh let us read like real Pentecostal 1 2 3 go Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord pause now the great day has already happened and John the Baptist was the angel the messenger that came to prepare the first coming of Jesus but the Dreadful day shall burn as an oven which will be the day of fire the day of Vengeance Is Yet To Come it is coming Jesus is coming back again we believe that Jesus is coming back again the word will not continue the way that's why brother our major concern is not our denominations it's not the church you belong to it is the word you believe and we see it coming back again and verse six says amen it shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children come on read it with me 1 2 3 go and he shall turn fathers to the children that is finished it was John who turn the hearts of the fathers of the law to the wisdom of the jti from the law to Grace but we see there's another part before the Dreadful day comes he shall come on and the Heart uhuh of the children to their father that part is happening now that part has happened in our generation this Elijah the prophet has come and his message oh has been like healing in the wings amen it has stand our hearts our faith back again to our fathers it has turned it away from Catholicism it has turned it away from Orthodox religion it has turn it away from anglica from Pentecostal from Baptist from all these denominations has turned it away from that and turned it back again to the world back to the right understanding the church must be restored and we are the restored church and these people are not only here oh come on are you one of them they are not only here they almost everywhere and their hearts are on fire they have been changed they have been filled with the Holy Ghost they baptized in Jesus name and God is moving in their lives praise the name of the Lord first Thessalonians 5 verse one it says but of the times and of the seasons Brethren you don't need that I write unto you you don't need me right to you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night is coming as a thief in the night someone was saying when the Rapture happens struggle now when I see brother Brian going I will jump and I catch him brother Bri don't leave me don't leave and brother ban will be fighting with me brother if you planning to do that better receive the Holy Spirit now because the day will come as a thief in the night you won't even know by the time you wake up if if you were a husband who was not serious and your wife was serious so you will wake up one day in the morning honey honey are you in the B are you in the kitchen please in the house what's happening please stop playing you think it is gam and then before you know it it Dons on you the Rapture and you knew it you were always heing the P talk but for you were very busy and you remember the day used to hear the pastor preaching about the Rapture it would be painful because you remember clearly you were doing that you remember you even remember in your you woke up when he said the Rapture the word will come back against you Rapture it has happened it is not a story oh God and one brother said I told you about that preacher he was telling his people that listen to me when you have missed the Rapture please save all the food you can because you won't be able to buy anything please go in a cave if you find the nearest because you don't need to get the mark of the and it's a good advice I hope no one needs it here I hope we will all go but I'm sure if you don't go you remember the words I've spoken and you will be the among ones looking for a cave and you can't find a cave in your village and you'll be ready to die and you can't die you have to be persecuted and you be wondering why don't I kill myself and die you cannot Breen that day is coming we don't want to know what is there we can only imagine according to what is written in the scriptures but not everything is written so we don't know what will be there we also don't know what everything will be in heaven all I want is I want to be there and I know Heaven is not a story I know Heaven is a reality and and we are going to go there because we have received eternal life here so I want to be serious with my God I want to be on fire for my God because I want to be there praise the name of the Lord now Luke chapter 17 talks about the son of man being revealed this is a very special scripture I want you to please pay attention vers 26 and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man you know we began in Matthew 24 where it speaks about the coming of the son of man and now here in Luke listen he's explaining how the coming of the son of man will be now remember here is the interesting part Jesus he is the son of man when he is on Earth as a prophet are you following me but right now he's a Son of God that is the dispensation he's operating in for the record let me just rehearse this a little bit for you he he comes first as a son of man that happened if you can't write it down that happened from uh Bethlehem or from um then to Calvary his ministry on Earth that he was a son of man Prophet who ended up dying and then Jesus also comes as a Son of God now as a Son of God that is the not a prophetic Ministry it's the Holy Spirit Ministry it started on the day of Pentecost up to when [Music] up to the Rapture now he's also going to come again a son of David a son of David it is going to be in the millennial range we will be with him in the millenum and he will rule all through the white Throne judgment all through the tribulation son of David he has no mercy towards the Gentiles his heart is only with the Jews and with his bride but we see here the Bible is talking about as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man they did itat I want you to be pay attention because there's something I want to bring to your understanding they did itat they drun they married wi they were given marriage amen until the that Noah entered into the Earth and the flood came and destroyed them all likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat they drank they br they s they planted they builded by the same day the lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all now listen carefully even thus shall it be in the day listen carefully when the son of man is revealed now Church pay attention he's not talking about the coming of the son of man he's talking about the revelation of the son the son of man already came and his ministry ended on the cross but this is the prophecy he's saying the son of man ministry will be the son of man will be revealed again through a prophet if you got it say am okay listen the revelation of the Son of God how do we know that so and so is revealing the son of man through the sign of the Messiah because the sign of the the son of man is the Messiah you're following me the son of man is the Messiah so now when do we see the sign of the Messiah the first time we see the sign of the Messiah is when he was speaking to Peter he called your name is Peter Simon son he revealed and then Peter was a man and he followed Jesus all his life and another time he designed a man called Nath he told him when you were under a tree I saw you behold an Israelite a man with no gu how did he know be how did you know when saw that and he asked how did you know he said when you were still under the tree I saw you he wasn't there physic but he designed and he could tell everything about believe this is the Messiah every one that Jesus revealed to himself like that they did not ask anything else they believed he was the Messiah are you following me oh my God there's some Revelations here L listen carefully now that was among the Jews Jews but there was another group called The Samaritan and there's another group called the Gentiles who are the Gentiles we who are the Samaritans it is a group of mixture of Jews and Gentiles there so they considered like Gentiles but not real Gentiles now Jesus told all his 12 disciples go and buy meat imagine telling 12 men to go and buy meat maybe a or two kilog of meat there was something Jesus was doing the Bible says he had to go through Samaria oh Hallelujah am he was going to go to Samaria to reveal himself to someone there so when he reached all the men were away he Mets a woman that loves lovely story we know the woman at the well he begins talking to her he said give me to drink she then she begins saying for us we are Samaritans we don't give water we don't have any connection with the Jew Jesus said if you knew who was asking you give me to drink you would know the the can give you you will never thirst again she said give me to drink give me to drink oh someone should say this morning give me to drink there is more Revelation oh hallelujah amen and now Jesus continued he said go bring me your husband then she said I have no husband Jesus said you have spoken well because you have had five husband and the one you're living is also not yours the woman was shocked she had a water picture she threw it down and she ran the and she told everybody come listen to this words come see this man who has spoken everything about me and she said isn't this why did recognize him because he revealed the sign of the Messiah the Messianic sign amen the mic is a designment of the heart oh my God Church please don't miss this don't miss this the designment of the heart is different from the gift which the Bible calls the designment of spirits the designment of the heart is like the scripture which says the of God is sharper than it can cut through Soul and Spirit diving SHP it designs the heart everything about a person know the name of of a person you remember once one time the first time it happened was with Abraham and Sarah is someone following me when when M came that night he was with three two other angels and they were walking they were they had that Dusty and Abraham saw them Abraham had Revelation tell your neighbor Abraham had re Abraham did not say my lords Abraham saw him and it was revealed to him there something about this Hallelujah he said my Lord please come my and the says he gave him oh my godu who do weay to who to the Lord Abraham had Revelation that this was more than a man this is God revealed him revealing himself to me but people always miss it and some of you will miss it today but many of you will get it and don't miss it and so when the Messiah came WR to him at that moment he he spoke to Abraham he said according to the time of life next year your wife s shall be with child Sarah had that she was in the tent cooking and Abraham was and while she was cooking and she had that in her heart she laughed this man doesn't know how long in heart and said why did your wife and S said I did laugh because she had not laughed but she did in her but this one could be able to design what's in the heart of this one you get it is the same Jesus who came on Earth and spoke to Peter and also designed that woman of Samaria and the woman went and said come see a man who has spoken everything about me this the very Messiah and he said you know the Bible talks about the gift of of the discernment of spirits but sometimes that one can hit a Miss you've seen it happening among Min it can fail and it can happen sometimes but the one that Jesus had it was the word [Music] revealing it cannot fail because it is God it's the revelation of the son of man now among the Gentiles it had never happened until the ministry of a man called William William Bram listen carefully many preachers International preachers all over the world talk about William and his ministry has been going on for more than 50 years since he died but there are people who follow his message all over the world but these people um uh who who don't believe in his ministry have been able from time to time they have said when brother Bram was Discerning this is how his meeting was done come line up all of you three people would line up here look at me you're lining up for me to talk to you yeah so line up good now the people would line up they would give them prayer cards and they would line up and he would begin talking from one person to the other and he would say I I am your brother I am nobody I cannot help you but if he who the son of man Jesus Christ if he will come just now I he will talk to you he will use my mouth and he will talk to let's see let's wait sincerely he would wait the things are on table and he would wait and then there would be a silence and then he would say he's here the Holy Spirit now I put every spirit in under my control for the glory of God and then he would say is this the patient I mean he would be in Two Worlds there is this physical world and he's also seeing spiritual things so he would is this the yes then he would look at the man and say your name is Brian Bri you come from he would mention the village you come he would mention the problem he would say I see you in the hospital the doctor you know yeah yeah it is this disease he would mention the disease and he would say if you believe with all you have go away from you and then you would say you are healed just like that and another person and another person and each of these people you can go back thank each of these people he would tell details sometimes in the congregation he would say it's not me I'm not reading their mind it is him he's here and then he would turn to the congregation and say over there your name is so and so stand up on your feet you've been praying that if that is God let talk about me stand up on your feet now thousands of times details and details it never failed even once not even one time said that Rob that that and many other preachers who were there physically they told you not once [Applause] not once they didn't ever fail they confirmed that it was not William Bram doing that it was Jesus Christ revealing himself to the Gentiles through a prophet to fulfill the prophecy that says even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed Jesus say the things I do shall you do also the things I do shall you do also because I go to the father now everything that was in the ministry of Jesus is supposed to repeat itself in the bride but we saw this scripture fulfilling the ministry of William BR and you know what he revealed Jesus he showed how did he reveal him you reveal him in two ways by the restoration of the word and by the signs the Wonders the Miracles the power of God and people who come and debate and say oh no this is a false prophet they cannot be able to do what he did they cannot be able they cannot be able to disbelieve what he told I tell you church we have a true message that has been Vindicated by God we don't follow a man we are following Jesus Christ he has been revealed in our generation praise the name of the Lord but you see says when they say peace and safety then destruction will come upon them travail upon as a woman with a child and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren you are not in darkness that the day should overtake you as a thief hallelujah sister Monica Hallelujah he says he shall come as a thief in the night but to you Brethren the day will not overtake you to me he will not come as a thief in the night do you know why because we have heard the voice of the bridegroom when you hear his voice you cannot be overtaken hallelujah amen you know what it feels to receive a visit at home when you are not ready for them you feel so bad you not ready you even feel like escaping and hiding are you around you just hide but when you are ready he has told you I'm coming the only way you can be ready is he will tell you he's coming he will come to he will come to them as a thief in the night will not be ready they will hide away from the Wrath but to you who fear his name the son of righteousness will arise with healing in his wng to us we shall know we shall know even as we are known of him we cannot be overtaken but when you in a bar when you're missing around with a girl laughing when you are there doing your own things we've had this football games people are going almost naked and they're living in the wild and sing and laughing and you a Believer join that kind of thing we have a better thing let me tell you we have a better thing and and you know I sent a mess in the group this morning which I want to read out to you because it really moved me praise the name of the Lord let me just use another illustration he says have you ever noticed how the world gets into the spirits of things that are in the world they go to their ball games they are sporting even they daners they enter into the spirit of it you know if you a Believer and you go to a nightclub if you're true a Believer you will run out your spirit won't like it I will not ask you to raise up your hand but I would have asked you who and you tell me how you felt but I hope there is no one who was tried that is maybe if you have not yet believed maybe if you have not yet you know you go there I remember when I was still in school in high school you they have that party after exams when they about to do exams end of end of level so um they called for I don't know how they call it these days they call it so they they do party and they call everybody come and dance they tell you dress the way you want do whatever you want come and enjoy so people came day I was in Hostel I said to myself let me go and enjoy with them at least this once can know what happens so I was an Anglican then and um so I went and as I was entering the Sten just hit me I ran away as hard as I could I'm sure if anyone found me there they would have said you a s and you're quiet but I tell you friends that is we are not of the world we are not of the world that's the closest I've ever gone to a dance party and he says there sporting events and ball games you find them with their energy he saying but oh how they hate Christians you know for getting into the spirit of God is word when we dance when we are happy when we are shouting when we are clapping our hands they call us Fanatics they call us holy rollers there is nothing they want do to show their hatred and disapprove of us but I say ignore that you can expect it knowing knowing where it is coming from just go on and get in the spirit of worship Hallelujah am and he said our spirit is [Music] clean it is fresh it is real it is sober and serious full of the joy of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah the Christian ought to be just as exuberant as and full of his of of his uh pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it servers and delights in its both Christians and the world are human both have emotions the difference is the Christian is hearts and emotion purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh I'm not going to go there and satisfy the flesh like they're doing let me tell you Church don't worry I'm not off my subject I'm talking about the pattern of the true every true minut if you are in the spirit you will always satisfy the spirit in you never feel shy to dance for the Lord if you're telling us for you you are emotionless you are lying it means your are emotion is touched by other things maybe you are one of those that go go to the CL and then you dance so when you come here you are ashamed maybe you go in those football games even remove their shs Mania but Brethren the spirit of Christ is another is a clean clear fresh Spirit when we are dancing for the Lord we are not ashamed of this am Oh Glory I said Glory we are not ashamed of shouting we are not ashamed of saying amen who cares only the devil and his people for us we are we are not ashamed of it why because we have our emotion on the things of God but when they said peace peace peace then sudden destruction shall come upon them like a travail of a woman with child they shall not Escape but for you Brethren you are not in darkness tell yourself I am not in darkness that day will not overtake me a in the night he says you are all children of light come on put up the scripture brother first thians 5 says the children of life and the children of the day we are not of the night we are not of Darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night oh hallelujah hallelujah they sleep in the night but for us we are not of the night they that be drunken they Drunken In the Night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love and forment the hope of [Music] salvation for God has not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen we have been appointed for salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ but how can you if you have never been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are among those that will say sorry I never knew you I preached I made Miracles I brought many I never knew why you were not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus chist I didn't know because you believe that believe in the word the word is very clear praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah uh usually I don't want to take you for so long and so I will not talk about the third part for tonight and and I'm sorry sometimes I have to just finish like that when the spirit tells me stop I stop so God bless you stand up on your
