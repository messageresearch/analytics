[24:25] maybe one of the brother in that meeting
[24:30] he has been down
[24:45] that it may Minister Grace

[29:26] blessed with the name of the Lord
[29:28] we are living in that time today when
[29:32] people does not care about it
[29:35] preachers have preached about the Holy
[29:38] Spirit
[29:40] until

[32:48] five years ago
[32:50] ten years ago
[32:54] men and women
[32:55] used to spend time on their knees
[32:59] they go on the islands to pray they go
[33:02] in the forest
[33:06] amen but today
[33:10] you'll hardly find one Soul at the
[33:13] altario
[33:19] I know what I'm talking about
[33:22] blessed be the name of the Lord
[33:25] where young men would spend their night
[33:27] at church
[33:46] hearing the message
[33:51] I mean gospel song
[33:54] Amen they come early to church
[33:57] and by the time you come the church is

[34:12] a promise save us going to
[34:15] go
[34:16] what's going to help you and me
[34:19] it is the token it is the Seal of God
[34:24] because the holy spirit is on the word
[34:27] of God
[34:33] Amen what places the Holy Ghost is
[34:36] prayer
[34:39] blessed be the name of the Lord you say
[34:42] that when he the Holy Ghost is come on
[34:45] he will bring this thing into your
[34:48] remembrance
[34:50] said with the name of the Lord Jesus was
[34:54] with the disciples
[34:55] and remember when they went to pray
[34:59] he came like three times
[35:08] I know that spirit is willing but the
[35:11] body is weakness
[35:17] Jesus was with the disciples yes
[35:21] amen the Holy Ghost shall not come
[35:24] inside them
[35:27] but many the same man after the day of
[35:31] Pentacles amen
[35:40] you not even need to wake them up
[35:45] it was now the Holy Spirit living in
[35:47] there
[35:49] blessed be the name of the Lord
[35:53] we must be sealed
[35:58] and we must know why we need the holy
[36:00] spirit
[36:03] amen Amina you are looking for money
[36:07] but you are not looking for the Holy
[36:10] Spirit
[36:14] blessed in the name of the Lord
[36:16] we are seeking for food
[36:20] the Holy Spirit
[36:23] the Holy Spirit wants to be sold um
[36:30] amen and that's what God demands from
[36:33] USA
[36:36] is going to get worse
[36:39] if the world will stand another 50 years
[36:41] the whole world would be totally insane
[36:47] again
[36:49] the prophet spoke this verse in 1964.
[36:53] today
[37:01] men and women they are marrying dogs
[37:04] they are marrying pigs the other day
[37:08] I saw
[37:10] among a clip of a man who were the
[37:13] crocodile
[37:15] was some more busy
[37:21] um
[37:24] can you imagine
[37:26] blessed in the name of the Lord
[37:32] now what this is what the prophet spoke
[37:34] about nothing
[37:43] the bridegroom with a solid wire
[37:48] oh goodness
[37:56] you don't want it to have open mouth
[38:00] that is insanity
[38:07] foreign
[38:27] and it is okay
[38:30] it is okay according to the world system
[38:33] in Singapore but when you arise and
[38:36] preach against that
[38:38] against homosexuality against those
[38:42] things
[38:52] they are crazy
[38:54] [Music]
[38:55] blessed be the name of the Lord
[38:59] supposed to Roman 8 38 says that for I
[39:02] am persuaded um
[39:27] to separate us
[39:30] amen when we are sealed we are still in
[39:34] Christ Jesus
[39:43] blessed with the name of the Lord as we
[39:46] are looking for money
[39:47] as we are working as you're educating
[39:50] our children
[39:54] let us not forget let us not forget that
[39:58] God send the Holy Ghost
[40:03] blessed in the name of the Lord
[40:07] but when I'm in the message Resurrection
[40:09] it says
[40:12] he say that I believe that
[40:15] that every
[40:21] everything is
[40:27] blessed in the name of the Lord we
[40:30] cannot believe the word without the Holy
[40:32] Spirit
[40:33] we cannot keep this word without him
[40:37] this word cannot work without him
[40:41] because the Bible says that when he the
[40:45] Holy Ghost you say that that when the
[40:48] spirit
[40:49] that raises
[40:55] he will Quicken our motor bodies
[41:15] that's why we must be sealed

[41:53] you may be a good preacher you may be a
[41:57] good singer you may be a good housewife
[42:00] a good businessman
[42:04] all those things are good
[42:07] but you need the holy spirit
[42:10] because all those things will end
[42:13] the Bible says gift will assist
[42:23] but what is going to keep you going is
[42:25] the holy spirit
[42:28] blessed with the name of the Lord amen
[42:41] why schools are sealed air into
[42:43] everybody
[42:44] it's up to it's his destination
[42:49] and when God gives us this uh the holy
[42:52] spirit
[42:53] that is a down payment
[42:58] remain with another Peace
[43:05] you are presenting the Holy Ghost
[43:09] amen when the other peace comes
[43:13] you must have another Peace in you God
[43:16] is
[43:23] this you are eating the world you are
[43:27] increasing the rate of magnetism in you
[43:30] and that is the holy spirit

[43:43] you already have the same element in you
[43:47] here we are in the end time
[43:50] coming from the East and the west and
[43:53] North and the South
[43:55] what are we doing getting ready for the
[43:59] Rapture
