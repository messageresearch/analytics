[44:05] the brothers.
[44:10] When [music] he begins to preach is
[44:11] roaring like a lion.
[44:15] that this moment humbled here.
[44:18] Let us pray a blessing upon them.
[44:23] Our kind heavenly father, we have been
[44:25] privileged to witness the betroal of
[44:29] this couple.
[44:34] Lord, I want to to thank you for the
[44:37] life of brother Julius
[44:41] and the life of Sister Faith
[44:44] and how you have led them this way.
[44:48] We know Lord, you are the one that u
[44:52] orders the footsteps of the righteous.
[44:56] Lord, it's been his desire. It's been
[44:58] his prayer.
[45:01] And Lord, for you to bring them to this
[45:02] moment today.
[45:05] It is a victory and we appreciate you
[45:08] Lord. We now ask your blessing upon them
[45:12] for protection for provision and will
[45:16] witness yet again.
[45:19] Brother Joseph and sister Mariam
[45:23] don't forget to pray for them. Their
[45:24] wedding is coming up when
[45:28] coming up when
[45:31] it 22nd November.
[45:34] Yes.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; So, uh this is next month.
[45:39] &gt;&gt; Then brother Enoch
[45:43] I think is also not here. He went to
[45:45] Sister Mass's church
[45:49] where they would also announce their
[45:51] engagement there.
[45:56] Um and so we also remember that couple.
[46:01] And so today, brother Julius
[46:05] and sister Faith, [cheering]
[46:07] &gt;&gt; we say congratulations to you.
[46:10] [applause]
[46:10] &gt;&gt; Uh when do you have uh dates for us yet
[46:17] 23rd March
[46:20] that is the wedding introduction
[46:25] and then you have the dates for the
[46:26] wedding? Not yet. Okay.
[46:30] We please remember those uh those
[46:32] couples in prayer.
[46:35] Amen.
[46:37] And we have more in the pipeline.
[46:40] So there's still a lot of work to do.
[46:44] Praise the Lord.
[46:46] So we need to continue praying for for
[46:48] for that. And
[46:50] you know, of course, you know, the
[46:52] church having a lot of young people.
[46:56] When a church has young people,
[46:59] it is a good thing. It has its own
[47:00] dynamics,
[47:04] but you know, uh, they're always vibrant
[47:07] and on fire and focused, right?
[47:12] But then when they get married,
[47:17] so it's also a good thing,
[47:19] but it has also its own dynamics.
[47:24] So then they become more busy and
[47:27] sometimes you know um then they again
[47:30] you go into having children and
[47:34] so I just don't want you to lose your
[47:35] fire.
[47:37] Tell your neighbor don't lose your fire
[47:41] especially he that is engaged
[47:45] or married and I think I left out one
[47:48] couple
[47:51] sister Monica
[47:53] and brother Sadat.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. And and and so there there do you
[48:00] know your debts yet? No, not yet. Okay.
[48:05] But uh we we are also praying for you.
[48:09] Sister Monica, you were just right here.
[48:11] You should have raised up your hand and
[48:13] reminded me.
[48:17] Amen. I just felt I had forgotten
[48:19] somebody. So
[48:21] and um you know I realize that u of
[48:24] course we we are getting into a
[48:25] different dynamics as a church.
[48:30] Um you know a lot of uh a lot of people
[48:34] getting married.
[48:37] We do not need to lose the focus.
[48:42] You know the Bible says that you know
[48:44] they were giving in marriage and then
[48:47] and then sudden destruction.
[48:56] So So I would like you not to disconnect
[49:00] from the purpose
[49:04] and the purpose is the coming of the
[49:06] Lord,
[49:08] the rapture.
[49:10] do whatever you are doing. But let us
[49:12] focus on the coming of the Lord.
[49:16] Is that amen?
[49:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, Sister Stella, we want to
[49:20] welcome you back. God bless you. We pray
[49:22] for you.
[49:24] &gt;&gt; And I'd like to congratulate brother
[49:26] Emmanuel on for his graduation.
[49:30] God bless you. Congratulations, brother
[49:32] Emanuel.
[49:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Polap asked me to
[49:36] greet you this morning.
[49:41] Shall we stand? Now we just change the
[49:42] order of the service.
[49:46] We want to go to the word this morning.
[49:50] We are opening from in the book of
[49:52] revelation
[49:57] chapter 3.
[50:05] [clears throat]
[50:09] Revelation 3 14-22.
[50:24] We are reading you know all the message
[50:27] for Ladys here.
[50:30] And unto the angel of the church of the
[50:32] ladians, write these things, sayeth
[50:34] them, amen, the faithful and true
[50:35] witness, the beginning of the creation
[50:38] of God. I know thy works, that thou art
[50:40] neither cold nor hot, I would I would
[50:43] thou w.
[50:45] So then, because thou art lukewarm, and
[50:47] neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee
[50:49] out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I
[50:51] am rich and increase with goods, and
[50:53] have need of nothing. and knowest not
[50:56] that thou art wretched and miserable and
[50:59] poor and blind and naked. I counseel
[51:01] thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire
[51:04] that thou mayest be rich and white men
[51:06] that thou mayest be clothed and that the
[51:08] shame of th nakedness do not appear and
[51:11] anoint thine eyes with thyself that thou
[51:13] mayest see as many as I love I rebuke
[51:15] and chestn therefore and repent. Behold,
[51:18] I stand at the door and knock. If any
[51:21] man hear my voice and open the door, I
[51:24] will come into him and will s with him
[51:26] and he with me. To him that overcomemeth
[51:29] will I grant to sit with me in my
[51:30] throne, even as oh I also overcame and
[51:34] I'm set down with my father in his
[51:36] throne. He that has an ear, let him hear
[51:39] what the spirit saith unto the churches.
[51:54] I mean,
[52:03] Foreign
[52:10] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[52:30] foreignch.
[52:59] foreign.
[53:29] Amen. Amen.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Just as we were praying,
[53:34] just ask the Lord to minister to you
[53:35] this morning.
[53:39] My heavenly father,
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Lord, I I come here to speak to you
[53:43] because I have before me the purchase of
[53:46] your blood.
[53:50] I do not take it lightly
[53:54] to be in a service like this
[53:57] where many come not to hear from a man
[54:00] but to hear from heaven.
[54:05] Lord, may may you take this moment and
[54:07] minister your word of life to us.
[54:13] May you speak to each and every one of
[54:14] us.
[54:16] me out of the way
[54:19] and may you speak to your children.
[54:22] Father, I commit everyone into your
[54:23] heart, preaching of your word into your
[54:25] heart in Jesus name I pray.
[54:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:30] &gt;&gt; Please be seated.
[54:34] Amen.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; I just also wanted to say that uh please
[54:38] remember me in prayers.
[54:42] I'm going to um I'm going to be away.
[54:46] about two weekends
[54:50] to North America.
[54:55] There is one of the major things that uh
[54:58] really I'm going to accomplish there.
[54:59] the Lord willing,
[55:03] one of the brothers, I don't know how
[55:04] many how many did you get got a chance
[55:06] to see the articles that we have on the
[55:08] website on the church,
[55:11] &gt;&gt; the missions reports,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; mission report,
[55:16] several of them. Yeah, you can see just
[55:19] a few. So many of you perhaps have not
[55:23] got it.
[55:26] Um but um you need to go read it.
[55:31] There is one article that was speaking
[55:34] about uh a brother that one of the first
[55:37] believers in Ethiopia
[55:42] and you know he moved to to Canada now
[55:47] actually he's one of the very first he's
[55:49] the very first couple he and and and um
[55:52] brother Habtom and his wife sister Misra
[55:55] were the very first to be uh wedded
[55:59] &gt;&gt; in the country of Ethiopia
[56:04] in our ministry. Of course, not the
[56:06] other denominations I'm talking about.
[56:10] So, uh so he he now moved to to North
[56:14] America
[56:17] and we got in touch recently
[56:20] and he has this burden and he's already
[56:22] trying to reach out to uh some of the of
[56:26] the other Ethiopian pastors.
[56:31] and introducing the message to them.
[56:34] So he has requested he requested me to
[56:37] come and maybe to help him and talk to
[56:40] them and you know evangelize them with
[56:43] this message.
[56:47] So I need you to remember that in
[56:49] prayer.
[56:51] Maybe we'll meet a few of his friends
[56:53] and ministers whoever,
[56:56] but we will also be going in several
[56:58] other churches.
[57:00] And so, please remember that in prayer.
[57:04] Amen.
[57:07] Are we ready for the word this morning?
[57:10] Are we ready for the word this morning?
[57:13] Amen. I I appreciate if you can sit
[57:16] still.
[57:18] It doesn't mean that you should not say
[57:20] amen.
[57:22] But sist still.
[57:25] If you want to go out,
[57:27] this is the right moment to do it.
[57:30] So that now you can be able to come back
[57:32] and sit through the suns.
[57:36] So this message we have read um from
[57:39] revelation 3
[57:42] is speaking of the lad ra's a message to
[57:47] the ladian church age.
[57:51] to the angel of the L of the Lian
[57:54] churches.
[57:57] Brother, if you could give me that
[57:59] picture of the church ages.
[58:02] Um, so we have seven church ages.
[58:07] And if you look at Revelation and please
[58:09] I want you to please take. If you look
[58:12] at uh Revelation chapter 1,
[58:17] chapter 2
[58:19] and chapter 3, these chapters [snorts]
[58:22] are talking about the seven gentile
[58:26] dispensation.
[58:32] You know this the gentile dispensation.
[58:34] The Bible speaks of it in Romans chapter
[58:38] 11.
[58:42] Romans chapter 11.
[58:45] He says that the Gentiles
[58:50] they were the wild olive branch.
[58:56] But you know the Jews were the original
[59:00] branch
[59:04] on the vine.
[59:06] The vine is Christ.
[59:09] The vine is the word.
[59:12] But I want you to follow this
[59:14] that the Jews
[59:16] did not be receive Christ.
[59:20] They rejected him.
[59:23] And we know that they are the ones who
[59:25] actually sold him to the Romans
[59:29] and the Romans crucified him.
[59:33] You remember when Pontius Pilate said,
[59:35] "Uh, but I find no cause.
[59:39] The man is not guilty."
[59:42] But then the Jews said, "No,
[59:46] don't worry about his blood.
[59:49] Let it be upon us."
[59:52] and our children.
[59:54] And so the man said, "Okay."
[59:56] And he washed his hands
[59:59] and he gave it he gave him to them and
[1:00:03] they crucified him. So by that single
[1:00:06] act,
[1:00:08] the Jews rejected Christ.
[1:00:12] Yet they were the original branch.
[1:00:16] They were given the initial opportunity
[1:00:19] to receive him.
[1:00:21] Like the scripture says, he came among
[1:00:24] his own
[1:00:26] but his own received him well.
[1:00:30] You know they rejected him and even
[1:00:34] later on we see the apostles are
[1:00:36] preaching among the Jews
[1:00:40] and the Jews rejected them.
[1:00:43] And you know Paul said it was good that
[1:00:46] the gospel be preached among you first
[1:00:49] seeing that you have rejected him.
[1:00:52] Lord we turn to the Gentiles.
[1:00:56] And from that moment on
[1:00:59] God be God changed his focus
[1:01:03] and his focus has been on the Gentiles
[1:01:08] and the Jews. They were left in the in
[1:01:12] the darkness.
[1:01:14] The Bible says they were blinded
[1:01:17] until today. Brother Shalom, the Jews do
[1:01:20] not receive Christ.
[1:01:23] The Jews cannot, you know, they cannot
[1:01:25] receive the revelation that we have
[1:01:27] today.
[1:01:30] But the the Gentiles
[1:01:33] are receiving it and enjoying it.
[1:01:37] He is a perfect type of Joseph of the
[1:01:38] Old Testament.
[1:01:42] how his brethren rejected him.
[1:01:44] But the the the Gentiles, the Egyptians,
[1:01:48] they received him. And the scripture
[1:01:51] says to as many as received him
[1:01:55] to them, he gave power to for them to
[1:01:58] become the sons of God.
[1:02:01] And so today I'm sharing with you on
[1:02:03] beyond the system.
[1:02:11] The reason why they rejected Christ
[1:02:14] was because of the system that they had
[1:02:16] at the time.
[1:02:21] They are Jewish systems,
[1:02:24] they are denominations.
[1:02:27] We will get into it as we continue.
[1:02:30] But then we see that the Bible in Romans
[1:02:33] 11,
[1:02:35] if you write it down please and you go
[1:02:37] and read the whole Romans 11,
[1:02:42] the Bible says that but blindness
[1:02:48] that has happened to Israel
[1:02:50] has happened in part.
[1:02:54] They are not going to be blind
[1:02:55] permanently.
[1:02:58] It is for a season.
[1:03:02] And the Bible say they will be blind
[1:03:06] until the fullness of the Gentiles come
[1:03:11] in.
[1:03:17] Praise God.
[1:03:19] Uh please open Romans with me.
[1:03:24] I know there are others who have never
[1:03:25] read about this.
[1:03:28] And it is important you see what I'm
[1:03:30] talking about.
[1:03:32] Brother, first give me Romans 11.
[1:03:37] And I just want that portion
[1:03:40] that speaks of that.
[1:03:43] Praise God.
[1:03:50] vers uh 20
[1:03:56] 25
[1:03:58] the whole of it is good but we just for
[1:04:00] our thought we'll just take verses 25
[1:04:06] brother Marvin you have to employ some
[1:04:09] speed now for I would not brethren that
[1:04:12] ye should be ignorant of this mystery
[1:04:19] Okay, look on the screen here because I
[1:04:21] want us to get to get it together. For I
[1:04:24] would not, brethren, that ye should be
[1:04:26] ignorant of this mystery,
[1:04:29] lest ye should be wise in your own
[1:04:31] concept.
[1:04:34] That blindness
[1:04:38] part
[1:04:41] is happen to Israel
[1:04:45] until the fullness of the Gentiles be
[1:04:48] come in.
[1:04:53] Get back to the picture. So now you see
[1:04:55] when he says the fullness of the
[1:04:57] Gentiles,
[1:05:01] the fullness of the Gentiles
[1:05:05] comes through a generation
[1:05:11] of seven phases,
[1:05:15] seven ages,
[1:05:18] seven period
[1:05:22] of the of the church of Jesus Christ.
[1:05:28] So these are the ages that you see here.
[1:05:31] And you know Jesus has how many
[1:05:34] churches?
[1:05:37] 2 3 4 5 6 7.
[1:05:40] Come on, answer me now.
[1:05:43] One church.
[1:05:45] Jesus has one church. You remember which
[1:05:48] he told the disciples upon this rock
[1:05:52] upon what? The revelation.
[1:05:55] The rock here is not Jesus.
[1:05:58] The Catholics say
[1:06:00] that the rock is Peter
[1:06:03] and that's why they bu they buried they
[1:06:05] killed Peter.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; The Romans killed Peter
[1:06:09] and they buried him in in Vatican
[1:06:13] and they built a big building on top of
[1:06:15] it
[1:06:17] and they called it St. Peter's Basilica.
[1:06:22] &gt;&gt; This is in history. Go read it.
[1:06:24] And then they said Peter is the first
[1:06:28] pope.
[1:06:30] And because Jesus said Peter,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; you know, because his name was Simon. So
[1:06:36] you said that Peter meaning small stone
[1:06:40] and upon this rock, I will build my
[1:06:42] church. So they said because Peter means
[1:06:45] small stone,
[1:06:48] he is the rock that Jesus would build
[1:06:51] his church.
[1:06:53] And so they build that big building
[1:06:57] and they said, "So this is the church
[1:07:01] ecclesia
[1:07:04] &gt;&gt; which means the worldwide churches
[1:07:08] and that's why they killed in the dark
[1:07:10] ages
[1:07:13] many believers because they refuse to
[1:07:15] bow to this church system
[1:07:20] because this church system
[1:07:22] different from what Jesus had
[1:07:24] introduced.
[1:07:26] They said Peter was the first pope.
[1:07:29] But Peter was a married man.
[1:07:34] So I am more of a Catholic then than the
[1:07:36] pope.
[1:07:39] Said Peter flesh and blood has not
[1:07:44] revealed this to you,
[1:07:47] but my father in heaven has revealed
[1:07:50] this to you. and upon this rock,
[1:07:55] meaning upon this revelation
[1:07:59] that you Peter have received
[1:08:02] of who I am, I will build my church.
[1:08:07] So the true church of Jesus is built
[1:08:10] upon the revelation of Jesus Christ.
[1:08:16] Praise God.
[1:08:18] And so that was the church
[1:08:20] and that church would you know go
[1:08:24] through seven ages.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; It started at Pentecost
[1:08:30] and then the disciples came and uh and
[1:08:33] preached this message.
[1:08:36] Paul was the messenger
[1:08:39] the first church age.
[1:08:41] If you go to Revelation chapter one you
[1:08:43] will see the church ages.
[1:08:46] You know, he mentions them
[1:08:53] these where Listen now, now this is like
[1:08:56] a teaching, but I'm not a teacher. So, I
[1:08:58] just want you to follow.
[1:09:01] I just want you to follow through this.
[1:09:03] You know, these were cities
[1:09:07] historically.
[1:09:09] There were cities
[1:09:11] in Asia Minor.
[1:09:13] These are ancient cities.
[1:09:16] But when you see what the Bible said in
[1:09:19] the book of Revelation before he
[1:09:21] mentioned them,
[1:09:25] he told the angel spoke to uh John
[1:09:29] and told him [clears throat] the things
[1:09:31] which I'm about to tell you
[1:09:34] write.
[1:09:35] Okay. Praise God. Can we go to
[1:09:38] Revelation one
[1:09:40] and then we will come back to our
[1:09:42] subject.
[1:09:45] Praise God.
[1:09:50] Amen. Revelation chapter one.
[1:09:55] Um let me just see the verse that I
[1:09:58] wanted to read for you.
[1:10:03] Verses one.
[1:10:05] the revelation of Jesus Christ, which
[1:10:07] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:10:09] things which must shortly come to pass.
[1:10:17] And he sent and signified it by his
[1:10:19] angel unto his servant John.
[1:10:25] These are things which must shortly come
[1:10:26] to pass.
[1:10:28] So it was not it was in the future.
[1:10:33] And then he says vers three, blessed is
[1:10:35] he that readeth and they that bear hear
[1:10:37] the words of this prophecy.
[1:10:42] And keep those things which are written
[1:10:43] therein, for the time is at hand.
[1:10:49] John to the church seven churches
[1:10:53] which are in Asia.
[1:10:56] I told you these seven churches were
[1:10:58] seven churches in seven places in Asia.
[1:11:06] But the angel here is using these seven
[1:11:09] churches
[1:11:11] as symbols
[1:11:13] to the seven future church ages.
[1:11:19] Grace be unto you and peace from him
[1:11:21] which is and which was and which is to
[1:11:23] come and from the seven spirits which
[1:11:24] are before his throne.
[1:11:32] And from Jesus Christ, who is the
[1:11:33] faithful witness
[1:11:37] and the first begotten of the dead,
[1:11:40] the prince of the kings of the earth,
[1:11:42] unto him that loved us and washed us
[1:11:44] from our sins and in his own blood.
[1:11:50] Praise God.
[1:11:52] Now I John
[1:11:55] N
[1:11:56] &gt;&gt; who was who also am your brother
[1:12:00] &gt;&gt; and companion in the in tribulation and
[1:12:02] in the kingdom of patience of Jesus
[1:12:04] Christ. I was in the island that is
[1:12:06] called Patimos for the word of God and
[1:12:07] for the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[1:12:10] And I was in the spirit on the Lord's
[1:12:12] day, and he had behind me a great voice
[1:12:14] as of a trumpet, saying, I am Alpha and
[1:12:17] Omega, the be the first and the last,
[1:12:20] and that which thou seeest, write in a
[1:12:23] book, and send it unto the seven
[1:12:26] churches, which are in Asia, unto
[1:12:28] Ephesas, and Mannon, Pgamos, Theat
[1:12:31] Theura, Sadis, Philadelphia, and unto
[1:12:34] Ludicia. Could you read that portion,
[1:12:37] please?
[1:12:53] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:12:55] And I just wish we could read the whole
[1:12:57] of it, but we don't have the time to do
[1:12:59] that.
[1:13:01] These are the seven church churches
[1:13:03] which were in Asia
[1:13:07] and uh you know like I said the these
[1:13:10] are all gentile places
[1:13:14] and of course chapter two and chapter
[1:13:16] three
[1:13:18] they now deals with the details of each
[1:13:20] church.
[1:13:23] But as you will quickly see
[1:13:26] each church was symbolizing a future
[1:13:28] age.
[1:13:32] another future or what you can say a
[1:13:34] future period of the same church.
[1:13:42] That's why you see those years there
[1:13:45] right from AD53
[1:13:49] up to today 2025.
[1:13:55] Time has been moving.
[1:13:57] But you see, God has a timeline.
[1:14:03] God has seasons.
[1:14:06] God has times that he has predetermined
[1:14:10] before the foundation of the world.
[1:14:15] And for the times and the seasons of the
[1:14:17] Jewish church,
[1:14:20] we already know it by the 70 weeks of
[1:14:22] Daniel.
[1:14:26] You know,
[1:14:28] We've talked about that before
[1:14:31] and we know that the Jews
[1:14:34] in God's season and time
[1:14:37] they are remaining with three years and
[1:14:40] a half for God to deal with them.
[1:14:45] When Jesus was killed,
[1:14:48] the first portion of the seven years was
[1:14:50] finished
[1:14:53] when the Messiah was cut off. But after
[1:14:56] Jesus,
[1:14:58] follow me closely. After Jesus,
[1:15:02] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says in the book of
[1:15:03] Daniel that the Messiah was cut off,
[1:15:08] meaning killed, meaning removed.
[1:15:10] And he said not for himself.
[1:15:14] So he wasn't killed for himself.
[1:15:17] He was not guilty.
[1:15:20] He was killed for you and I. [screaming]
[1:15:23] So he was removed. He was cut off. But
[1:15:27] after he was cut off, the times of the
[1:15:30] Jews was paused.
[1:15:35] Now this why? Because they had rejected
[1:15:37] him.
[1:15:39] You know, he's a gentleman.
[1:15:42] Jesus can never force himself on you.
[1:15:46] He is a gentleman.
[1:15:48] He says, "I am on the door and I know.
[1:15:52] He that will open for me, I will come
[1:15:55] in. Would you open for Jesus this
[1:15:57] morning?
[1:15:59] Amen. Whatever prepare to speak right
[1:16:01] now,
[1:16:02] Jesus wants to speak to you. But he
[1:16:05] won't force you to hear it.
[1:16:08] Only if you can open your heart
[1:16:11] and be willing to hear
[1:16:13] and be willing to eat,
[1:16:16] I say he will feed you this morning.
[1:16:19] But then we see after he was cut off
[1:16:22] then the seasons of the Jews
[1:16:26] was paused.
[1:16:28] Not stopped but paused
[1:16:34] but there was remaining another season
[1:16:38] of three years and a half.
[1:16:41] Are you understanding what I'm saying?
[1:16:43] But also that three years and a half
[1:16:47] that God will deal with the Jews
[1:16:51] also he will deal with the Gentiles
[1:16:56] during the time that is called the great
[1:16:58] tribulation
[1:17:00] that will be after the rapture of the
[1:17:03] bride.
[1:17:07] Those churches that remained in the
[1:17:09] systems of man
[1:17:13] You know they will be left out. They
[1:17:16] will be left behind. And Christ will
[1:17:19] rapture his bride
[1:17:22] that has been made a word bride.
[1:17:28] But the other denominations
[1:17:30] they will remain behind.
[1:17:32] They will stay behind. We are not of
[1:17:35] those that are of Satan's age.
[1:17:38] [screaming]
[1:17:40] We will not remain behind.
[1:17:43] We will be changed in a twinkling of an
[1:17:46] eye.
[1:17:47] This motor shall put on immortality.
[1:17:52] But then we see the the the three years
[1:17:55] and a half
[1:17:57] will be the time of the tribulation.
[1:18:00] But also the Jews will receive their
[1:18:04] prophecy.
[1:18:07] They will receive their two prophets.
[1:18:11] One Moses, two Elijah. So they receive
[1:18:15] their Elijah
[1:18:17] that will restore back the word.
[1:18:20] And they receive the same word you are
[1:18:22] receiving today.
[1:18:25] They will believe the same Jesus you are
[1:18:26] believing today.
[1:18:28] They will receive the same Holy Ghost
[1:18:30] you are receiving today.
[1:18:32] Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. But
[1:18:35] you see before that time,
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. and after Jesus was cut off,
[1:18:43] up to the time when the decisions of the
[1:18:45] Jews will re will be restarted.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; You need to first enter into the
[1:18:55] revelation that I am in and then
[1:18:56] interpretation will become very easy.
[1:18:58] From the time the Messiah was cut off
[1:19:03] up to the time when the Jews received
[1:19:06] their prophecy
[1:19:10] because remember their time was Paul
[1:19:14] after Jesus died
[1:19:17] and then the time will be restarted
[1:19:22] after you know the the rapture
[1:19:26] their time the times of the Jews.
[1:19:28] will be restarted.
[1:19:30] So between this time and that time there
[1:19:34] is a space
[1:19:37] and that space what do you think he is
[1:19:40] doing?
[1:19:42] He is gathering a bride
[1:19:46] and that space
[1:19:49] the denominations cannot know anything
[1:19:51] about it.
[1:19:54] They don't know anything about it.
[1:19:56] People think we're just worshiping God.
[1:20:01] No, we are walking in the seasons and in
[1:20:04] the times.
[1:20:08] Part of the purpose of this message of
[1:20:10] the hour
[1:20:12] is to tell us what time we are living
[1:20:14] in,
[1:20:17] what season we are living in.
[1:20:20] We are not walking believing
[1:20:22] presumptuously.
[1:20:25] We know where we are. We know who we
[1:20:28] are.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; We know what is coming. We know where we
[1:20:33] are standing because the word
[1:20:35] [screaming] has has been open to us.
[1:20:38] Praise God. And now we know about the
[1:20:41] seven church ages.
[1:20:44] God gave this revelation
[1:20:47] to our prophet brother
[1:20:50] and he was able to see by the spirit of
[1:20:52] God
[1:20:54] the seven churches
[1:20:56] what they mean when they were
[1:20:59] [screaming]
[1:21:00] you know when brother wanted to draw
[1:21:02] this picture here
[1:21:04] as he was drawing it on the board
[1:21:09] you may never have heard of this
[1:21:12] the presence of God came
[1:21:16] and the Holy Spirit with his own pain
[1:21:21] he finished this image here.
[1:21:24] This is a supernatural image.
[1:21:28] You may think it is theology.
[1:21:31] This is not theology. [screaming]
[1:21:33] It is talking about our season, our
[1:21:36] times, where we are standing, what is
[1:21:39] coming.
[1:21:41] Where are we standing? We are right at
[1:21:44] the end of it all.
[1:21:47] Praise God.
[1:21:50] Amen. Brother Dixon,
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; come and sit over here.
[1:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right be mama. I don't want you to
[1:21:56] miss anything.
[1:22:00] Praise God.
[1:22:01] Amen. And so here
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; you see Paul Iranian Martin Luther
[1:22:08] and then the last one Elijah
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; who actually happens brother Bham never
[1:22:13] said I'm the one
[1:22:15] but we know the last one is brother
[1:22:18] William
[1:22:21] who is the messenger of the last church
[1:22:23] age
[1:22:25] you know the first church age messenger
[1:22:29] he said let me remove this court so I
[1:22:32] can bring this properly.
[1:22:37] Praise God.
[1:22:39] The first church age messenger,
[1:22:42] he laid the first doctrines of the
[1:22:44] church.
[1:22:47] Paul the apostle, he preached to one
[1:22:50] God. He preached water baptism in Jesus
[1:22:53] name.
[1:22:54] He said no women preachers.
[1:22:57] He said the order in the church.
[1:23:01] He said everyone cannot speak tongues at
[1:23:03] the same time.
[1:23:06] He said one speak one interpret
[1:23:09] maximum three times in the church.
[1:23:12] And you know he taught all these
[1:23:13] foundational teachings
[1:23:17] what you call the principles of the
[1:23:19] doctrine of Christ.
[1:23:22] He laid it out
[1:23:25] and that was the basis
[1:23:28] of the teaching of the Christian church.
[1:23:32] But over the ages,
[1:23:34] you know, the devil came to eat it out
[1:23:38] and introduced system.
[1:23:42] And in each generation,
[1:23:44] God sent a message
[1:23:47] with a message to help the people to go
[1:23:51] beyond the system.
[1:23:54] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; You know, in the beginning, God sent
[1:23:57] [screaming] Paul, he let the people
[1:23:59] beyond the
[1:24:02] in the second age.
[1:24:05] But let me tell you, in our age, I won't
[1:24:09] delay you with other ages.
[1:24:12] Let me talk to you about our age.
[1:24:15] God in our age, he has sent a messenger
[1:24:20] that would lead us with a revelation of
[1:24:22] the word,
[1:24:24] the last messenger to the last church
[1:24:26] age
[1:24:28] would also have the spirit of Elijah in
[1:24:31] you.
[1:24:33] The spirit of Elijah restores you back
[1:24:36] to the world.
[1:24:39] And when you are restored, [screaming]
[1:24:41] I will tell you what happens. When you
[1:24:43] are restored back to the word,
[1:24:46] you go beyond the systems.
[1:24:52] [screaming] You go beyond a
[1:24:53] denomination.
[1:24:57] What is your religious denomination? We
[1:24:59] are beyond all that.
[1:25:02] We are not a denomination
[1:25:04] because we have gone beyond a system.
[1:25:08] But for the systems of denomination,
[1:25:12] you know the Bible speaks of them in
[1:25:14] Ladyia in Revelation to the message 8
[1:25:22] on vers 16. Oh, help me this morning so
[1:25:26] we can get this church.
[1:25:28] So then because thou art lukewarm
[1:25:32] now he's talking to the the system
[1:25:36] the church which was supposed to speak
[1:25:39] on behalf of Jesus.
[1:25:42] I may God help you church
[1:25:45] to first focus on the word this morning.
[1:25:49] Amen. Forget about anything else.
[1:25:53] Leave here as if this is the only moment
[1:25:54] you have.
[1:25:57] Amen. And so see this, you know, they
[1:26:01] they were to speak on behalf of God,
[1:26:06] but
[1:26:08] they became lukewarm.
[1:26:11] They could not stand on the word
[1:26:13] anymore.
[1:26:15] I'm talking about the denomination,
[1:26:18] the big religious systems.
[1:26:21] So they could not they were no longer
[1:26:23] hot.
[1:26:25] They were not not cold.
[1:26:27] So he said because you are not cold or
[1:26:31] hot,
[1:26:32] I will spew thee out of my mouth
[1:26:36] because you say I am rich
[1:26:39] and increased with good
[1:26:41] and have need of nothing. So this church
[1:26:45] system
[1:26:48] they are spewed out of the mouth of
[1:26:50] Jesus.
[1:26:54] There has been a change of
[1:26:55] administration.
[1:26:58] In this last age,
[1:27:01] the authority through which God once
[1:27:03] spoke
[1:27:05] shifted,
[1:27:08] he no longer speaks through the
[1:27:09] organized church systems of
[1:27:15] Amen. You know all these denominational
[1:27:18] walls,
[1:27:21] you know, once used to be the vessels of
[1:27:24] light.
[1:27:27] You know when you oh I wish I had the
[1:27:29] time but if I take the time then I will
[1:27:32] not be able to go through this.
[1:27:36] If you look at all these church agents
[1:27:39] when God sent these messengers
[1:27:42] when they died the people that were
[1:27:45] following their message
[1:27:47] they organized
[1:27:50] and they formed a religion.
[1:27:53] you know they they formed the
[1:27:55] Methodists,
[1:27:56] the Lutherans, the Anglicans that came
[1:27:59] out of it later and all these others and
[1:28:02] Presbyterians and you know they form
[1:28:05] organizations organizations
[1:28:07] organizations but at one point they were
[1:28:10] not an organization.
[1:28:12] They were the vessels [screaming] of
[1:28:14] light in their age.
[1:28:17] But you see they organized
[1:28:20] he spewed them out of his
[1:28:24] And you see now they have become
[1:28:26] barriers
[1:28:29] of the revelation of his word.
[1:28:33] God no longer uses the organized church.
[1:28:40] He no longer uses them as his voice to
[1:28:43] the nations.
[1:28:45] The same way the word moved from the
[1:28:47] Pharisees temple system
[1:28:55] You know, at first the the Pharisees,
[1:29:00] they were the ones with the word.
[1:29:03] They were the keepers of the law.
[1:29:06] But when Jesus came, they were no longer
[1:29:09] the ones.
[1:29:13] There was something that had come to
[1:29:15] take people beyond the system.
[1:29:20] So the same way the word moved from the
[1:29:22] Pharisees temple system,
[1:29:28] the word has once again in our day.
[1:29:32] It has changed its dwelling place.
[1:29:35] The word is no longer in creed.
[1:29:38] from creed to revelation.
[1:29:41] From systems of man
[1:29:44] to the spirit of the living God,
[1:29:47] from organization
[1:29:50] to the people called by his name.
[1:29:54] Let me tell you, we have been called out
[1:29:55] of systems.
[1:29:58] We have been called out of creeds.
[1:30:00] There used to be a time when we stand in
[1:30:02] the church and we begin to rehearse the
[1:30:03] creeds.
[1:30:08] Some of you maybe didn't but let me tell
[1:30:10] you God has changed administration.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why we say here we have no
[1:30:17] creed but Christ.
[1:30:20] Christ has spewed them out of his mouth.
[1:30:23] They no longer carry his voice.
[1:30:28] They have their own voice but not his
[1:30:31] voice. But God has not been left without
[1:30:34] a voice in this thing.
[1:30:39] He has a voice. [screaming]
[1:30:41] We are now living in a time when the
[1:30:44] voice has moved from the church system
[1:30:49] to the [screaming] bride.
[1:30:53] The voice of God is not in a church
[1:30:55] system.
[1:30:57] The voice of God is in me. The voice of
[1:31:00] God is now in you.
[1:31:03] That voice now speaks through the bride
[1:31:04] of Jesus,
[1:31:08] &gt;&gt; the wordborn [screaming] church.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; You know, Revelation 22:17 says
[1:31:15] the the spirit and the bride says come.
[1:31:20] The voice of the spirit and the voice of
[1:31:21] the bride are now one.
[1:31:25] And the same for Christ is being
[1:31:26] revealed
[1:31:30] through his bride.
[1:31:32] That's why church I was telling you
[1:31:35] that the greatest mystery
[1:31:38] that has been finished in our day
[1:31:42] as is Christ in you.
[1:31:45] He's now ministering through you.
[1:31:50] That's why we have gone beyond the
[1:31:52] seasons
[1:31:55] of one man ministry.
[1:31:59] But you're still you're still here.
[1:32:02] in Africa and many other continents
[1:32:05] for people saying, "Oh,
[1:32:07] man of God, who are this ministry to do
[1:32:10] this?"
[1:32:12] You know, they still go to the man of
[1:32:14] God, they give all their money, they
[1:32:15] give all
[1:32:17] so he can prophesy to them and give them
[1:32:20] something so he can heal them so he can
[1:32:23] break their curses.
[1:32:25] People's hopes are still in a manner.
[1:32:29] We have gone beyond that church.
[1:32:32] The bride has gone beyond that.
[1:32:35] And that's why this message is equipping
[1:32:36] you
[1:32:39] to realize your place in Christ,
[1:32:44] to realize your position in the world.
[1:32:48] But not all who claim the name of Christ
[1:32:51] are of the bride.
[1:32:55] In every age, the word of the Lord
[1:32:56] address two groups.
[1:33:02] But only the elect receive the
[1:33:03] revelation and are transformed by that
[1:33:05] revelation.
[1:33:10] I want to show you something here in in
[1:33:12] in uh in the church age book a regime to
[1:33:14] the ages.
[1:33:17] Brother if you can put the quote up
[1:33:19] that's nice.
[1:33:21] From our studies, we have already
[1:33:22] learned that much of the revelation is
[1:33:24] totally misunderstood because we have
[1:33:25] not formally known that the the church
[1:33:28] spoken of and spoken to in this book
[1:33:32] does not refer to the pure ecclesia, the
[1:33:34] elect, the body of Christ, the bride.
[1:33:38] You know when I read here to the church
[1:33:44] of the ladian right. You remember
[1:33:47] reading that to the church of the
[1:33:51] church. So there is a church spoken to
[1:33:56] and a church spoken about.
[1:34:01] So he says, "The church spoken of
[1:34:05] and the church spoken to in this book
[1:34:09] refer to the pure ecclesia,
[1:34:12] the elect,
[1:34:17] the body of Christ, the bride. But it
[1:34:21] speaks to the entire body of people who
[1:34:23] are called Christians.
[1:34:30] whether they be true or merely nominal.
[1:34:33] As all Israel is not Israel,
[1:34:36] so all Christians are not Christians.
[1:34:40] So we learn that the church is made up
[1:34:41] of two vines.
[1:34:44] The true and the false.
[1:34:46] The two vines are motivated by two kinds
[1:34:49] of spirits.
[1:34:54] One has the Holy Spirit
[1:34:57] while the other is endued with the
[1:34:58] spirit of antichrist.
[1:35:01] But both claim to know God.
[1:35:06] Both prop to speak for God.
[1:35:09] Both believe certain very basic truths
[1:35:11] and differ on others.
[1:35:15] But we further learn that these two
[1:35:18] vines would grow side by side.
[1:35:22] Time shows what is in you.
[1:35:26] Time shows what is in you.
[1:35:31] That's why never be too quick to judge
[1:35:32] anyone
[1:35:36] because they have not matured to your
[1:35:37] level of revelation.
[1:35:42] Let us always show grace to everybody.
[1:35:46] Some people are quick to judge.
[1:35:48] Oh, those ones are chicken. We are the
[1:35:50] bride. Oh, those ones said they are not
[1:35:52] going to the rapture. We are going
[1:35:55] You don't know. Oh, papa, wait. Don't
[1:36:00] at [screaming] the time of the harvest
[1:36:03] you. Everybody's going to show their
[1:36:05] true colors.
[1:36:08] Amen. Because as long as the word is
[1:36:10] preached,
[1:36:12] it will show who you are. The word will
[1:36:15] reveal your identity.
[1:36:18] Praise God. Amen. And that's why in the
[1:36:20] denominations
[1:36:22] they are using the word. They may not
[1:36:25] have the full revelation of it but it
[1:36:27] will reveal who they are.
[1:36:31] So the false vine would not overcome and
[1:36:34] would not destroy the true vine.
[1:36:39] But then neither would the true vine be
[1:36:41] able to bring the false vine into a
[1:36:42] saving relationship with Jesus.
[1:36:50] Let us first pause here. I want us to
[1:36:54] get it.
[1:36:55] Two things here. The false vine
[1:36:59] has always one purpose
[1:37:03] to destroy the true vine.
[1:37:07] Not so
[1:37:09] when the why do you remove weeds in the
[1:37:12] garden?
[1:37:15] because it will reduce yield.
[1:37:21] It will the garden that's why we remove
[1:37:23] wheat.
[1:37:26] But Jesus in his garden
[1:37:29] he said there is no weedy.
[1:37:33] Let it grow together.
[1:37:36] [screaming] Why? because he has put
[1:37:40] something in his sin
[1:37:44] that he knows they [laughter] can never
[1:37:46] be destroyed
[1:37:48] by the false vine.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; But then hear this.
[1:37:55] Also the false vine,
[1:37:58] the true vine rather, the true vine.
[1:38:01] Even if she wanted,
[1:38:04] [screaming] she cannot bring the false
[1:38:06] vine.
[1:38:09] into a saving relationship with Jesus.
[1:38:15] As much as you have the whole truth,
[1:38:19] you can never change anyone
[1:38:22] who is not meant to say it.
[1:38:28] I've seen many times
[1:38:30] you fall down and you preach to
[1:38:32] somebody, you preach to them, you preach
[1:38:33] them.
[1:38:35] Have you ever preached to someone until
[1:38:37] you want to box their head?
[1:38:41] Get it,
[1:38:44] but they still try to go off.
[1:38:48] If someone is a false vine,
[1:38:51] you can never make them see.
[1:38:55] Why do you see it? Because you are the
[1:38:58] true vine.
[1:39:00] Why don't they see it? Because they are
[1:39:02] revealing who they are.
[1:39:05] But [screaming] we thank God. We can
[1:39:07] never be destroyed by him.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We learn the most amazing
[1:39:12] truth
[1:39:14] that the Holy Spirit could and would
[1:39:16] fall upon the ungenerated false vine
[1:39:19] Christians
[1:39:29] and manifested powerfully in various
[1:39:32] signs and wonders.
[1:39:39] Even as Judas had a definite ministry in
[1:39:42] the Holy Ghost,
[1:39:45] though he himself was pronounced to be a
[1:39:47] devil.
[1:39:50] And so with these principles in mind,
[1:39:53] we start to trust the church through
[1:39:56] various churches.
[1:40:01] Praise God.
[1:40:03] Just follow closely here.
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; The birth of the church was at
[1:40:06] Pentecost.
[1:40:09] &gt;&gt; As the first Adam was given a bride
[1:40:12] fresh from the hand of God
[1:40:18] and was undeiled for a brief span.
[1:40:24] So was Christ. The last Adam given a
[1:40:27] bride pure and fresh at Pentecost.
[1:40:33] And she remained separate and undeiled
[1:40:36] for some time.
[1:40:41] How long this continued, we don't know.
[1:40:44] But one day, even as if was tempted and
[1:40:47] seduced by Satan.
[1:40:51] So the church, now remember, the church
[1:40:54] was was supposed to be the bride of
[1:40:56] Christ.
[1:41:00] The church was birthed at Pentecost.
[1:41:04] Are you following me? And it was
[1:41:07] supposed to be the wife of Christ,
[1:41:10] just as Adam also had a wife
[1:41:15] called Eve, the woman. But you see, she
[1:41:19] was virtuous for a space of time
[1:41:23] until the serpent came and her.
[1:41:27] In the same way when the church of Jesus
[1:41:30] was b.
[1:41:32] Oh my. May you may you get this.
[1:41:36] You see the birth the church of the the
[1:41:38] the wife of Adam
[1:41:41] was was birthed out of the ribs the side
[1:41:44] of Adam.
[1:41:47] In the same way the church of Jesus
[1:41:50] was also birthed out of the side of
[1:41:53] Jesus.
[1:41:57] on the cross. When they pierced him,
[1:42:01] blood and water came out that birthed
[1:42:04] the church.
[1:42:06] And we see that church at Pentecost.
[1:42:10] You see, when the life came in,
[1:42:13] when the life came in, that became the
[1:42:15] church. But now this was the supposed to
[1:42:19] be the wife of Jesus.
[1:42:23] If you get it, say amen.
[1:42:26] But in the same way, we don't know how
[1:42:28] long he would stay when he is not
[1:42:31] contaminated
[1:42:36] by the entrance of the antichrist
[1:42:38] spirit.
[1:42:41] And this is the spirit of the
[1:42:43] antichrist.
[1:42:44] Where ye have heard that it should come
[1:42:51] even now is already in the world.
[1:42:55] That's first John 4:3. And Jesus said
[1:42:58] concerning his bride in the first age.
[1:43:02] I have somewhat against thee,
[1:43:05] because thou hast left thy first love.
[1:43:08] Remember therefore from whence thou had
[1:43:10] fallen and repent.
[1:43:13] Now Revelation two,
[1:43:16] remember thou where thou hast fallen
[1:43:19] and repent.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; The church was in that first age already
[1:43:22] a fallen woman.
[1:43:27] I don't know whether you missed it or
[1:43:28] whether you got it.
[1:43:30] It was a perfect church.
[1:43:33] But we are reading in Revelation 2:4
[1:43:37] where he is now saying
[1:43:40] remember where thou has fallen
[1:43:43] and repent. Who is he talking about?
[1:43:48] to the church in Ephesus,
[1:43:51] the very first age.
[1:43:54] The church was already a fallen woman.
[1:43:58] Like Eve, she fell.
[1:44:03] As Satan had gotten to Eve before Adam,
[1:44:07] even now had Satan seduced the church
[1:44:11] at that time,
[1:44:14] the bride of Christ
[1:44:16] before the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[1:44:20] Give me that picture again, brother.
[1:44:23] You see, the marriage supper of the lamb
[1:44:27] does not take place in the in Ephesians.
[1:44:33] The marriage supper
[1:44:35] takes place after Lord this year.
[1:44:40] But now we are reading in Revelation two
[1:44:43] when he's referring to the church in
[1:44:44] Ephesians
[1:44:46] and he's saying you are fallen.
[1:44:50] Remember where you fail and repent.
[1:44:53] So he has already spewed that church out
[1:44:55] of his mouth.
[1:44:58] Just like just like the church, the
[1:45:02] woman,
[1:45:04] Eve, the serpent came to her
[1:45:09] just before Adam would come to take her
[1:45:13] in the same way. The church in Ephesians
[1:45:18] fell before the marriage supper of the
[1:45:20] Lord.
[1:45:23] Hallelujah. And what specifically was in
[1:45:25] our midst that caused the fall?
[1:45:31] Revelation 2:6.
[1:45:33] Everybody say the deeds of the
[1:45:35] Nicolantes.
[1:45:38] Already that first age had turned from
[1:45:41] following the pure word of God.
[1:45:47] They turned from God's demand of a
[1:45:49] church absolutely dependent upon him
[1:45:56] depending entirely upon God to fulfill
[1:46:00] his word
[1:46:03] from start to finish
[1:46:06] apart from human government
[1:46:10] and they turn to Nicolantism.
[1:46:16] By the way, is organizing a human
[1:46:18] government
[1:46:21] within the church,
[1:46:24] which is all governments do, legislate
[1:46:26] for the people.
[1:46:30] That's Nicolantinism.
[1:46:33] They have boards that lead the church.
[1:46:37] Have you heard of something called
[1:46:38] senote?
[1:46:41] They're the ones that lead the church.
[1:46:44] the curer
[1:46:47] that kind of hierarchy.
[1:46:51] They did exactly what Israel did.
[1:46:56] They took the expediency of human
[1:46:58] government instead of the word and the
[1:47:00] spirit.
[1:47:05] Now here God is addressing both vines.
[1:47:09] He's addressing the true vine and the
[1:47:11] false vine.
[1:47:13] The wheat and the tears, the wise and
[1:47:15] the foolish virgins,
[1:47:18] both growing together in the same field.
[1:47:22] They bear the same name.
[1:47:25] They claim the same relationship,
[1:47:28] but their fruits tell the difference.
[1:47:32] Therefore, when we speak of going beyond
[1:47:35] the system,
[1:47:38] we mean that the voice of divine
[1:47:40] leadership has moved.
[1:47:45] from these systems of manmade religion
[1:47:52] to the bride of the world.
[1:47:56] Let me tell you church to those of you
[1:47:59] especially those of you who are new to
[1:48:00] the message
[1:48:02] this message is not a system of
[1:48:04] religion.
[1:48:07] God has called us from all the man-made
[1:48:10] systems of
[1:48:14] We are not part of any denomination.
[1:48:18] We are the bride of the word.
[1:48:21] [clears throat] Tell your neighbor, the
[1:48:22] bride of the word.
[1:48:25] God is not using the big denominations
[1:48:27] of our
[1:48:30] to bring forth his word. He is using the
[1:48:34] word born pride.
[1:48:38] Amen. And you know she has this pride
[1:48:40] has taken his name.
[1:48:42] This bride has taken his nature.
[1:48:46] That's why if you don't have his nature
[1:48:48] yet
[1:48:50] be born again. Receive his nature.
[1:48:55] [screaming]
[1:49:00] Before you get the Holy Spirit, you can
[1:49:02] never be the bride. May God help us.
[1:49:06] The organized church
[1:49:08] they just carry his name
[1:49:12] but they have rejected his word.
[1:49:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible you know you know we
[1:49:20] have we hear them saying well I'm full
[1:49:22] gospel
[1:49:25] but when you see the full gospel
[1:49:30] it doesn't reflect what is here.
[1:49:34] But the bride, though she has been
[1:49:35] rejected by the world,
[1:49:38] has received his voice.
[1:49:42] And as it was in every age, the elect
[1:49:44] bride becomes the living oracle of God.
[1:49:55] I am the living oracle of God.
[1:49:59] through whom God speaks today.
[1:50:02] Do you know God is no longer speaking
[1:50:04] through a one-man ministry? Now,
[1:50:08] let me wake you up a little bit. God is
[1:50:11] no longer using one prophet all over the
[1:50:13] world.
[1:50:16] There has been change over
[1:50:17] administration.
[1:50:20] It's now a many membered body.
[1:50:23] God is using each of us the same.
[1:50:28] Because we are the bride.
[1:50:30] You know when you come to adoption,
[1:50:33] you are not talking about one person
[1:50:35] over the others.
[1:50:41] You are talking about everyone,
[1:50:44] every member of the body.
[1:50:48] Praise God. Theian systems,
[1:50:52] they have rejected the word.
[1:50:55] They are spewed out.
[1:50:58] That means they no longer speak for God.
[1:51:01] They have become their own voice. But
[1:51:04] God's voice has not been silenced in
[1:51:06] this day.
[1:51:08] It has just changed its channel.
[1:51:12] The voice of Christ now speaks through
[1:51:14] me, through you, through every
[1:51:15] individual.
[1:51:17] [screaming] For the bride and the spirit
[1:51:18] are saying the same thing.
[1:51:22] The shift is not from from Christ to the
[1:51:24] bride. No, no.
[1:51:29] But but you see it is Christ
[1:51:32] revealed [screaming]
[1:51:34] in his bride
[1:51:44] is revealed through the bride. It is
[1:51:47] through the bride that Christ is speak
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; the authority of Christ.
[1:51:51] and anointing are now manifested through
[1:51:53] his bride.
[1:51:57] Christ is sealed ahead.
[1:52:00] Hallelujah. The bride is the his body on
[1:52:03] earth
[1:52:06] works under his direction and anointing
[1:52:10] as my father has sent me. He says even
[1:52:13] so send I you
[1:52:16] through the the Holy Spirit the power of
[1:52:18] the Holy Ghost. The bride continues his
[1:52:21] work.
[1:52:24] What is the work of Christ?
[1:52:26] What was he doing on earth?
[1:52:29] He was
[1:52:31] saving the lost,
[1:52:34] healing the sick,
[1:52:36] interceding for souls,
[1:52:39] declaring the word.
[1:52:42] I have a question for you.
[1:52:44] Are you the voice of Christ today?
[1:52:49] What are you doing
[1:52:51] to show that you are that voice?
[1:52:56] What was Christ doing?
[1:52:58] He was healing the sick, extending mercy
[1:53:02] to the lost,
[1:53:05] interceding for souls,
[1:53:08] declaring the word, speaking the word.
[1:53:11] And this means we are supposed to do the
[1:53:14] same same thing.
[1:53:17] is the head. We are the body.
[1:53:19] We are his representatives on us today.
[1:53:24] We are walking in hisstead.
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; You know what the pope says he is? The
[1:53:29] pope says he is the one instead of the
[1:53:31] son of God.
[1:53:34] But he's taking the bless of the bride.
[1:53:38] We are here to offer mercy.
[1:53:41] We are here to lead souls to salvation.
[1:53:44] We are here to lay hands on the sick.
[1:53:47] and to continue the work of the ministry
[1:53:50] of Christ which is the work of
[1:53:52] redemption.
[1:53:56] We must remember he said all power is
[1:53:58] given to me on earth and in heaven
[1:54:02] and the Holy Spirit was not sent to
[1:54:03] replace Christ
[1:54:07] but the Holy Spirit was sent to continue
[1:54:09] his work.
[1:54:12] Now I want to take this to a certain
[1:54:14] corner. Go to the book of Colossians
[1:54:15] chapter 2.
[1:54:24] Chapter 2 8. Look at look at that. It
[1:54:26] says, "Beware lest any man spoil you
[1:54:28] through philosophy and vain deceit after
[1:54:30] the tradition of men, after the
[1:54:32] rudiments of the world, and not after
[1:54:34] Christ. For in him dwelleth all the
[1:54:36] fullness of the Godhead bodily, and ye
[1:54:39] are complete in him, which is the head
[1:54:41] of all principality and power." Amen.
[1:55:01] Can you please read that again from
[1:55:02] verses 8 to 10?
[1:55:21] The Bible says we are complete in him.
[1:55:25] Christ came in word form through
[1:55:27] prophetic messages in our generation.
[1:55:34] to restore our faith back again.
[1:55:39] We have witnessed Christ's coming
[1:55:43] in word form.
[1:55:46] Listen, people are believing for him to
[1:55:48] come.
[1:55:50] We believe he will come. By the way, we
[1:55:53] believe the corporate body will come
[1:55:54] back.
[1:55:57] He has already come. Hallelujah. 1
[1:56:00] Thessalonians chapter 4 says that he
[1:56:05] will descend with a shout and a voice to
[1:56:08] descend with a shout and a voice and a
[1:56:11] trumpet and that shout is the message
[1:56:13] the word.
[1:56:16] Christ has already come in word formal
[1:56:21] through the prophetic ministry
[1:56:24] and has manifested his bride.
[1:56:30] Let me say this. He has manifested me
[1:56:35] &gt;&gt; in me rather.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; If you look at Romans 8:19, very
[1:56:39] wonderful scripture. He says, "For the
[1:56:42] earnest expectation of the creature
[1:56:44] waitth for the manifestation of the sons
[1:56:47] of God."
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; You don't need to turn to it, brother.
[1:56:54] For the for the honest expectation of
[1:56:56] the creature.
[1:57:01] waits for the manifestation
[1:57:05] of the sons of God.
[1:57:09] Did you hear that?
[1:57:11] &gt;&gt; Let us read it together. Brother, do we
[1:57:13] have it here? It says, "For the unex
[1:57:16] expectation of the creature,
[1:57:23] when we talk about creatures,
[1:57:25] &gt;&gt; we talk about anything that was created.
[1:57:30] When we talk about creatures,
[1:57:32] we talk about anything that was created.
[1:57:39] Be it thrones,
[1:57:42] be it powers,
[1:57:44] be it you know uh you know all the
[1:57:46] creation,
[1:57:49] all creation fell
[1:57:51] from glory.
[1:57:54] That's why today animals eat human
[1:57:56] beings.
[1:57:58] Animals were not supposed to eat human
[1:58:00] beings.
[1:58:01] Eat human beings.
[1:58:04] That's why you know people get demons in
[1:58:07] them.
[1:58:08] Those demons are not supposed to enter
[1:58:10] people.
[1:58:12] That's why people suffer.
[1:58:14] That's why you know people become very
[1:58:17] poor and they have they have nothing to
[1:58:19] eat and they're suffering.
[1:58:22] That's not the purpose and the intent of
[1:58:24] God.
[1:58:26] The purpose and the intent of God
[1:58:29] is that we are sons and we are here to
[1:58:32] show forth his glory
[1:58:35] and I want to finish with this thought.
[1:58:36] So just stay with me now.
[1:58:40] So the earnest expectation of the
[1:58:42] creature
[1:58:44] waits for the manifestation.
[1:58:50] I was just looking up this word in
[1:58:52] Greek.
[1:58:55] The creature is waiting for the
[1:58:56] manifestation.
[1:59:00] What is manifestation?
[1:59:03] In Greek they call it apocalyppsis
[1:59:07] apocalypsis which means
[1:59:10] to unveil
[1:59:15] to reveal
[1:59:18] to unveil.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Where is little David? I saw you David
[1:59:23] somewhere.
[1:59:24] Come up here. I want to demonstrate this
[1:59:27] for you. So I want you to understand.
[1:59:29] I want to show you the purpose of the
[1:59:32] gospel.
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; Stand right here, brother.
[1:59:38] You You want to squat down? Scroll down.
[1:59:41] Yes. So yeah. Yeah. I know you're
[1:59:45] physically fit.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; So this is what is happening.
[1:59:51] The sons of God
[1:59:54] before the revelation of the word
[1:59:58] they are veiled
[2:00:01] in defeat
[2:00:02] and because they they are still veiled.
[2:00:06] They don't know who they are. The
[2:00:08] creatures are suffering.
[2:00:11] The people are suffering
[2:00:14] in sin, in troubles, in sickness, in
[2:00:18] problems. Their solution
[2:00:22] is you
[2:00:24] but you cannot help them if you are
[2:00:28] still veiled.
[2:00:30] Many believe many sons of God
[2:00:34] are still veiled.
[2:00:37] The purpose of the message of Yahweh
[2:00:41] is to unveil
[2:00:44] the bride to unveil you. The earnest
[2:00:49] expectation of the creature
[2:00:52] is for the manifestation
[2:00:56] is for the unveil
[2:01:00] of the sons of God. But you are still
[2:01:03] veiled now
[2:01:05] and the denomination is still veiled.
[2:01:08] God bless you. Until the message come.
[2:01:12] Are you following me now?
[2:01:15] Before the message comes, there is no
[2:01:17] unveiling to take place.
[2:01:22] We don't even know who we are.
[2:01:25] But after unveiling,
[2:01:28] after the word has come,
[2:01:31] you know what the word has said as
[2:01:32] emphasize this these words in 1 Peter
[2:01:34] chapter 2.
[2:01:36] It says, "But ye are a chosen
[2:01:38] generation.
[2:01:40] We [screaming] are a royal priesthood.
[2:01:43] We are holy nation, a peculiar people."
[2:01:46] By the way, whenever I read this, I I
[2:01:49] just receive it in my spirit myself.
[2:01:54] that ye should show forth the praises of
[2:01:57] him who has called you
[2:02:01] out of darkness, out of
[2:02:03] denominationalism, out of the systems of
[2:02:05] man into his marvelous [screaming] light
[2:02:11] which in times past we are not a people,
[2:02:14] but now we are a people of God
[2:02:17] which had not obtained mercy, but now
[2:02:20] have obtained mercy.
[2:02:24] At first I used to think that I was a
[2:02:27] son of my father
[2:02:30] whatever my family was going through
[2:02:33] I thought I have to go through whatever
[2:02:36] defeated them I thought it has to defeat
[2:02:38] me and you know sometimes I've seen
[2:02:41] people many times
[2:02:43] they begin to console themselves
[2:02:46] because of what they going through in
[2:02:47] their family
[2:02:50] you find them you know
[2:02:56] you know, then you begin consoling
[2:02:58] yourself
[2:03:00] according to where you came from.
[2:03:03] But the purpose of the message of Yahweh
[2:03:07] is to unveil you
[2:03:11] to reveal you. You have been hidden all
[2:03:14] this while,
[2:03:17] but now you have been unveiled.
[2:03:20] The word has revealed who you are.
[2:03:23] The the victory of the believer
[2:03:27] is realizing her true potential
[2:03:31] is
[2:03:32] realizing her true identity.
[2:03:35] that my identity
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; is not in the failures or the
[2:03:41] circumstances that are negative around
[2:03:43] me
[2:03:48] or what people have spoken about them.
[2:03:52] There are so many people who are always
[2:03:53] offended
[2:03:55] at what people speak about them.
[2:04:00] You are too short.
[2:04:04] You are too ugly.
[2:04:06] You are too small.
[2:04:08] You are too far.
[2:04:11] So when people hear those comments,
[2:04:14] you can maybe be one of them here. You
[2:04:16] can hold something against somebody for
[2:04:18] years.
[2:04:21] Why? Because they said, "I'm too small.
[2:04:23] I'm too tiny.
[2:04:25] I'm too dark. I'm too bright. I'm too
[2:04:26] this."
[2:04:28] What you're seeing is not me.
[2:04:32] What you are seeing is this piece of
[2:04:33] flesh.
[2:04:35] which is not a part of me really.
[2:04:38] This came from the ground is going to go
[2:04:40] back to the ground.
[2:04:42] But I [screaming] who am I? I am a son
[2:04:45] of God and I actually came from God
[2:04:49] and I go back to God.
[2:04:52] That's my identity in Christ.
[2:04:56] So what defines me is what the word
[2:04:59] says.
[2:05:02] So I am a chosen generation. I am a
[2:05:05] royal priesthood. I am a holy nation. I
[2:05:07] am special.
[2:05:10] Can you imagine says you are special?
[2:05:13] Peculiar means you are different. You're
[2:05:15] not like everybody [screaming] else.
[2:05:18] So I I want to re ree it to you tonight.
[2:05:22] You are not like everybody else.
[2:05:26] When I mean you, I am talking to the
[2:05:28] bride. We are not like the Catholics. We
[2:05:32] are not like the Anglicans. We are not
[2:05:34] like the Muslims. We are not like any
[2:05:36] denomination. We have been called out of
[2:05:38] all that system [screaming]
[2:05:41] to come out of her my people. Where are
[2:05:43] we right now? The Bible says we are
[2:05:46] seated in heavenly blessings
[2:05:50] with Jesus Christ.
[2:05:52] Praise God. The unveiling of who you are
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; automatically connects you to the
[2:06:00] revelation
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; and understanding
[2:06:08] that brings you to the to your personal
[2:06:11] divine purpose.
[2:06:18] I want to show you a scripture here that
[2:06:19] really interested me. Acts 194
[2:06:24] And there were seven sons of onekever,
[2:06:29] a Jew, and chief and chief of the
[2:06:33] priests,
[2:06:35] which did so.
[2:06:37] And the and the evil spirit answered and
[2:06:39] said,
[2:06:42] Jesus, I know,
[2:06:45] and Paul, I know, but who are you?
[2:06:50] and a man in whom the evil spirit was
[2:06:52] leaped on the in was leaped on them
[2:06:58] and overcame them.
[2:07:01] This is very significant and prevailed
[2:07:04] against them
[2:07:06] so that they fled out of [screaming] the
[2:07:07] house naked
[2:07:09] and wounded.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[2:07:17] When let let me tell you something
[2:07:19] first. When a son of [screaming] God
[2:07:21] speaks,
[2:07:24] &gt;&gt; all creatures know
[2:07:26] they must obey.
[2:07:29] They must respond.
[2:07:31] But these spirits, these creatures in
[2:07:33] this man
[2:07:36] could not recognize the authority
[2:07:40] of these vagabond Jews.
[2:07:45] So and many believers today
[2:07:48] who are either not who they claim to be
[2:07:53] or they just have not been they are
[2:07:55] still veiled
[2:07:57] and therefore they are overcome by
[2:07:59] faith.
[2:08:05] Look at this scenario which we have
[2:08:07] read.
[2:08:10] When this man when this man when this
[2:08:12] man came and begin be began to cast out
[2:08:14] this demons
[2:08:16] by these demons are creatures.
[2:08:19] Did you know that
[2:08:22] they were angels before they fallen
[2:08:24] angels?
[2:08:26] But you see creatures are meant to
[2:08:29] recognize authority
[2:08:35] and a son
[2:08:37] I'm I'm giving you a key here.
[2:08:40] A son
[2:08:42] once he's adopted
[2:08:45] he speaks on behalf of the father
[2:08:50] whether it is the father the son who has
[2:08:52] spoken or the father it is almost like
[2:08:55] the son
[2:08:59] that's why when Jesus was being baptized
[2:09:02] the voice from heaven spoke this is my
[2:09:05] beloved
[2:09:08] Here ye
[2:09:11] him sir, not here ye God,
[2:09:16] but hear ye
[2:09:20] because he's a son.
[2:09:24] Now listen to me. When you feed on the
[2:09:26] word and you grow, you recognize who you
[2:09:29] are. You are a son of God. Bible says,
[2:09:32] "Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[2:09:35] It does not yet appear what we shall be.
[2:09:37] But when he comes, we shall be like him.
[2:09:41] When you recognize you are a [screaming]
[2:09:42] son,
[2:09:44] all the authority of the father
[2:09:47] is in you as a son.
[2:09:50] You can speak just like the father can.
[2:09:54] You can command just like the
[2:09:55] [screaming] father can.
[2:09:57] You can create like the father can
[2:09:58] create.
[2:10:00] You can change like the father can
[2:10:01] change. You can close. you can open.
[2:10:04] [screaming]
[2:10:05] That's why he said you I've given you
[2:10:06] power to bind and power to lose.
[2:10:11] And in every generation,
[2:10:13] in every church ages,
[2:10:16] throughout the seven church ages, in
[2:10:18] every one of them, he says to the
[2:10:20] overcomers,
[2:10:22] to him that overcometh, I will give him
[2:10:25] to eat of tree of life. To him that will
[2:10:27] overcome, I I will sit with him on my
[2:10:30] throne. Now listen. Amen. They are
[2:10:34] overcomers.
[2:10:36] You cannot overcome
[2:10:38] without fighting.
[2:10:41] Hallelujah.
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; Do you know what we are fighting in our
[2:10:44] age?
[2:10:46] We are fighting soft living.
[2:10:51] We are fighting
[2:10:54] coldness.
[2:10:57] We are fighting lukewarmness
[2:11:01] because this age is a age of people who
[2:11:04] want to live softly.
[2:11:08] That's why they don't even find time to
[2:11:09] pray
[2:11:12] even when it comes to church before the
[2:11:15] preacher begins to preach very busy
[2:11:17] looking at the time.
[2:11:21] It is a generation of people who have
[2:11:23] pity on themselves
[2:11:24] &gt;&gt; always you want to consult yourself.
[2:11:27] You want things easy.
[2:11:31] This is the age we are living in. And
[2:11:33] the devil has really taken over our
[2:11:36] generation
[2:11:38] through AI
[2:11:41] through technology through social media.
[2:11:44] Young people are swept
[2:11:47] out of their feet.
[2:11:50] And to overcome in this generation
[2:11:53] is difficult.
[2:11:55] But remember these are our demons to
[2:11:58] fight
[2:12:01] and overcome.
[2:12:04] But there are those who are going to be
[2:12:05] overcome.
[2:12:07] But there are those who have
[2:12:08] predestinated
[2:12:11] that will never be overcome
[2:12:14] with all the immoral demons
[2:12:18] that have been sent out in our
[2:12:20] generation.
[2:12:21] I mean you can mention them one by one.
[2:12:25] They are killing younger people by
[2:12:27] thousands and millions.
[2:12:31] It is almost very rare
[2:12:33] to find now a virgin
[2:12:39] and the devil begins to deceive you and
[2:12:42] to tell you it is not possible.
[2:12:45] But you don't know what you're talking
[2:12:46] about. God still [screaming] has the
[2:12:48] 7,000 somewhere.
[2:12:51] God has sealed the elect.
[2:12:54] God has seed
[2:12:56] that he [screaming] will always
[2:12:57] preserve.
[2:12:59] Amen. And even those that he takes,
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; even those the devil takes,
[2:13:05] he thinks I will finish them, he has
[2:13:07] already taken them in the web of his
[2:13:10] system.
[2:13:12] You know, like all these universities.
[2:13:14] When young people go there, it's like
[2:13:17] they have gone to Brussels.
[2:13:20] The devil takes them to his system
[2:13:24] and he and and he entangles them,
[2:13:28] cumbers them
[2:13:30] with a with a with a with a with a with
[2:13:32] a with a you know those immoral living
[2:13:37] and the younger people think everybody
[2:13:40] else is like this.
[2:13:42] So I'm not special. You are special. You
[2:13:46] have come here for for me to tell you
[2:13:48] you are special.
[2:13:52] You are not like those from Saturn's
[2:13:54] age.
[2:13:56] [screaming] God has a bride.
[2:14:00] I am laboring this morning to show you
[2:14:02] that there is a bride
[2:14:05] that God has that out of this
[2:14:08] [screaming] generation, he will preserve
[2:14:10] her for himself.
[2:14:13] Hallelujah. No matter what the devil
[2:14:15] [screaming] does,
[2:14:17] there will be that one. that will have
[2:14:20] [screaming] amen voice of God
[2:14:23] in our generation.
[2:14:26] Their voice [screaming] will be the
[2:14:27] voice of God.
[2:14:28] Their nature will be the nature of God.
[2:14:31] Their life will be the life of God.
[2:14:34] You know what? They are brought here not
[2:14:38] to be defeated. They are brought
[2:14:40] [screaming] here to defeat every spirit
[2:14:43] of
[2:14:45] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But you see
[2:14:49] these uh people we see in in Acts
[2:14:53] chapter 19
[2:14:56] just came and were trying to speak
[2:15:00] and trying to cast out these creatures
[2:15:03] and the creatures said you're saying in
[2:15:06] the name of Jesus whom Paul speaks about
[2:15:10] all right I recognize Jesus
[2:15:13] I recognize Paul but for you I Don't I
[2:15:18] don't I don't know you.
[2:15:20] Imagine when demons don't recognize him.
[2:15:24] That's what happens. Let me tell you,
[2:15:27] brother. When they did not recognize
[2:15:29] them,
[2:15:31] they quickly leaped on them.
[2:15:35] And the Bible says overame [screaming]
[2:15:37] them.
[2:15:40] Brother, come on. You see, let me tell
[2:15:42] you, demons are overcoming you
[2:15:45] because they don't recognize who you
[2:15:47] are.
[2:15:53] &gt;&gt; If you want to overcome,
[2:15:56] you need to recognize who you argue
[2:15:59] yourself.
[2:16:01] Who are you?
[2:16:03] You have to know I am a son of God.
[2:16:06] I am born of God.
[2:16:09] Yes, I am in this body of flesh.
[2:16:13] He's pulling me here, pulling me there,
[2:16:15] pulling me there. [screaming] But that
[2:16:17] does not define me.
[2:16:20] What defines me is what the word says
[2:16:22] about me.
[2:16:26] If the word says I'm an overcomer,
[2:16:28] I must overcome.
[2:16:30] If the word said I'm I'm a peculiar
[2:16:32] person,
[2:16:34] then I'm a peculiar people. I am not a
[2:16:37] commoner. I am different. I'm special. I
[2:16:41] am here to show the devil. I must
[2:16:45] overcome.
[2:16:47] I must overcome. What are you wrestling
[2:16:49] with, my brethren?
[2:16:51] Just recognize who you are.
[2:16:55] Get the true identity of who you are.
[2:16:59] When you speak to Satan
[2:17:02] and then devil [screaming]
[2:17:04] leave right now,
[2:17:06] he will not question,
[2:17:09] he will not question. He'll just say,
[2:17:12] "Okay,
[2:17:13] all right, sir." And he will take his
[2:17:16] name.
[2:17:18] But but but these boys as they're trying
[2:17:21] to exercise their authority
[2:17:24] said, "But who are you?
[2:17:26] &gt;&gt; We don't know you." They leaped on them.
[2:17:30] overcame them, prevailed against them,
[2:17:35] and they fled out
[2:17:38] naked
[2:17:40] and wounded.
[2:17:44] Don't think about casting out demons.
[2:17:49] I'm talking about you overcoming
[2:17:53] because those demons, don't think about
[2:17:55] them being in someone. They are looking
[2:17:57] after you every day.
[2:18:02] every single day of your life.
[2:18:05] You have to overcome them. Now we are
[2:18:07] called unto manifestation.
[2:18:11] Uh apocalypsis
[2:18:15] that is manifestation
[2:18:17] and unveiling
[2:18:19] revealing of who we are so that we can
[2:18:23] live our divine purpose.
[2:18:29] to to do what? [screaming] What's our
[2:18:31] purpose? To destroy the works of the
[2:18:34] devil.
[2:18:36] We who the bride [screaming]
[2:18:39] not the system. The bride
[2:18:42] the systems already are broken.
[2:18:46] But the bride is being built up. The
[2:18:49] bride is realizing who she is.
[2:18:52] Let me tell you, brother, feed on the
[2:18:53] word.
[2:18:56] I can ask you how many here read the
[2:18:58] message
[2:19:00] how many read the message
[2:19:03] how many listen to the message
[2:19:07] if you don't you are not feeding on the
[2:19:10] word and you're wasting time
[2:19:14] you have no different with the Catholic
[2:19:17] who is saying hail Mary mother of god
[2:19:19] bless
[2:19:22] no difference feed on the word because
[2:19:25] if you feed on the word, you will
[2:19:27] realize who [screaming] you are. And
[2:19:29] when you realize who you are, then you
[2:19:31] are going to live a life of purpose.
[2:19:35] You see, 1 John 3:8 says, "He that
[2:19:39] committeth sin is of the devil.
[2:19:42] For the devil sinnth from the beginning,
[2:19:45] for this purpose
[2:19:49] the son of God was manifest.
[2:19:53] This is now to make manifest
[2:19:57] The Greek word here is fenuro that he
[2:20:00] might destroy the works of the devil.
[2:20:02] [screaming]
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; He Amen. He was made manifest.
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; When you [screaming] are unveiled,
[2:20:12] you will be made manifest to the world
[2:20:14] whereby wherever you go, demons will
[2:20:16] recognize [screaming] who you are. They
[2:20:19] will take off at the mere mention of who
[2:20:22] you are.
[2:20:24] Because remember when you mention the
[2:20:26] father hallelujah demons know but if the
[2:20:31] son is really a son and the mention of
[2:20:34] the name of the son [screaming]
[2:20:36] demons will recognize that
[2:20:38] that's why the bible says he has given
[2:20:41] him a name above every name that the
[2:20:44] mention of the name of Jesus
[2:20:47] every knee [screaming] shall every
[2:20:50] should confess that Jesus Christ is lord
[2:20:54] But remember, it's not only about the
[2:20:57] person Jesus.
[2:21:00] Jesus is the head.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; You are the [screaming] body. So
[2:21:04] wherever you go, the devil should
[2:21:06] recognize who you are. You are the
[2:21:09] representation of [screaming] him.
[2:21:11] Hallelujah on earth.
[2:21:14] As long as you are out of the system.
[2:21:17] Amen. You are in a system of the world.
[2:21:22] Hallelujah. Praise God.
[2:21:26] In a message adoption,
[2:21:28] let me try to bring it to a close.
[2:21:32] He says this goes to all the world
[2:21:37] and I'm reading it now. It was spoken in
[2:21:39] 1960.
[2:21:42] So listen, I ask any historian to come
[2:21:44] and bring to me any text of scripture
[2:21:49] or any history, any vers of history that
[2:21:53] ever showed that any Protestant
[2:21:58] anybody was ever baptized in the name of
[2:22:01] the father, son, holy ghost
[2:22:05] until the Catholic Church ordained it in
[2:22:07] the sin council.
[2:22:12] Praise God.
[2:22:15] Father, Son, Holy Ghost is a false,
[2:22:17] bogus Catholic dogma
[2:22:23] and not a Christian baptism.
[2:22:27] [screaming] Luther brought it out from
[2:22:29] the Catholic church
[2:22:32] with catechism.
[2:22:35] We adopted it and come on.
[2:22:39] But then he says, "But [screaming] this
[2:22:40] day
[2:22:42] is a day of manifestation
[2:22:45] of the sons of God."
[2:22:47] When the mystery,
[2:22:49] you see how manifestation now comes in?
[2:22:52] When the mystery
[2:22:55] that has been hid since the foundation
[2:22:57] of the [screaming] world
[2:23:00] is to be made known.
[2:23:02] So when those mysteries be made known,
[2:23:06] &gt;&gt; the sons of God will come will be made
[2:23:08] manifest.
[2:23:12] Hallelujah.
[2:23:13] Hallelujah. [laughter]
[2:23:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. So now the message is
[2:23:20] not a bunch of doctrines.
[2:23:25] It's not legalism.
[2:23:29] Some people are still there.
[2:23:32] Let me tell you, we've moved on.
[2:23:36] The message is not a set of rules.
[2:23:42] Don't do this. Don't do that.
[2:23:52] You receive the message with mechanical
[2:23:55] faith, intellectual faith,
[2:23:59] then you cannot even be unveiled.
[2:24:04] You have to understand the this message
[2:24:06] of the hour is the revelation of the
[2:24:09] mysteries.
[2:24:14] Which mysteries?
[2:24:16] Actually, Revelation 10:7
[2:24:19] says, "The mystery, what mystery
[2:24:23] of God, all those mysteries
[2:24:27] are in that mystery."
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; Are you following me?
[2:24:31] Revelation 10:7. But in the days of the
[2:24:35] voice
[2:24:37] of the seventh day,
[2:24:40] when he begins to sound,
[2:24:43] &gt;&gt; everybody say it with me,
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; the mystery
[2:24:47] of God
[2:24:49] will be fixed.
[2:24:53] So the seventh angel message
[2:24:56] comes to finish the mystery.
[2:25:01] &gt;&gt; Colossians 1:27
[2:25:03] Even the mystery
[2:25:06] [screaming]
[2:25:07] which has been hid
[2:25:10] from ages, generations,
[2:25:12] but now has been made [screaming]
[2:25:14] manifest.
[2:25:18] Unto who? To his saints?
[2:25:22] To the bride. Not the church system, but
[2:25:25] to the bride [screaming]
[2:25:28] which is Christ in you.
[2:25:32] the hope of glory.
[2:25:34] The hope of glory. [screaming]
[2:25:36] So that's where the glory is. That's
[2:25:39] where we can make manifest.
[2:25:42] Amen. After the mystery has been
[2:25:44] revealed.
[2:25:46] So now we know.
[2:25:48] Let me put it let me break it down. The
[2:25:51] mystery of God
[2:25:54] is a revelation of Jesus Christ.
[2:25:57] So you know when you know him
[2:26:01] then you realize
[2:26:04] you are a part of him.
[2:26:07] You understand? He's the head. You are
[2:26:11] the body. So now you realize it's no
[2:26:14] more just about doctrine.
[2:26:19] It's the unveiling of the bride.
[2:26:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Go right back to Genesis
[2:26:31] to the original. What is it?
[2:26:33] Now the world and nature is groaning,
[2:26:35] crying,
[2:26:37] everything is moving. word for the
[2:26:40] manifestation of the sons of God.
[2:26:44] When true sons of God, born sons, filled
[2:26:46] sons speak and their word is backed.
[2:27:00] that is 1960.
[2:27:03] So I can today say it is here.
[2:27:08] Hallelujah. Set this [screaming]
[2:27:09] mountain.
[2:27:11] Let it be so.
[2:27:14] Brother, I desire so and so.
[2:27:17] A certain thing that be done. I'm a
[2:27:20] believer in Jesus Christ. And then you
[2:27:22] say, I give it to you in the name of
[2:27:24] Jesus Christ. Hallelujah.
[2:27:29] And then he says there is a
[2:27:30] manifestation.
[2:27:33] Oh brother, my crops are burning up out
[2:27:36] yonder.
[2:27:38] I don't have any rain. And then I say I
[2:27:41] send you rain [screaming]
[2:27:44] in the name of the Lord.
[2:27:46] There she will come. Hallelujah.
[2:27:50] The creature is waiting for growing
[2:27:54] all nature waiting for the manifestation
[2:27:58] of the sons [screaming] of God. God
[2:28:01] ordained it at the beginning.
[2:28:04] Amen. He gave man the domain on earth.
[2:28:07] The domain on earth is yours. Is mine is
[2:28:09] yours. Is [screaming] yours is yours. So
[2:28:13] what am I saying? You have to be
[2:28:15] unveiled.
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; The purpose of preaching
[2:28:20] is so you can know who you are. It's so
[2:28:23] you can be unveiled.
[2:28:25] So the veil can be removed.
[2:28:29] The veil can be removed.
[2:28:32] Amen. And the more it is removed, then
[2:28:36] you realize, hey, you mean I have that
[2:28:39] much [screaming] power?
[2:28:41] You mean I have that much authority?
[2:28:44] Oh, then a brother will come to you.
[2:28:48] Brother, I'm struggling with this
[2:28:49] spirit.
[2:28:51] I don't want it. And then you'll say for
[2:28:54] sure yes. He said okay you spirit I
[2:28:58] command you to leave him now
[2:29:01] and it will go.
[2:29:03] Hallelujah. A brother came here and he
[2:29:07] told me gave me this testimony. He said
[2:29:09] pastor you you you know I think it's
[2:29:12] from somewhere. He said you you know
[2:29:14] last time he came in the camp and he
[2:29:17] came specifically to me for prayer. He
[2:29:20] said I need prayer. I need a job.
[2:29:23] I said when do you want a job?
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because pastor Miranda and just
[2:29:29] preach to us who we are right.
[2:29:34] Amen. We a part of God.
[2:29:37] The logos has a part.
[2:29:42] So I told the brother, "So which job do
[2:29:44] you want? How much do you want to earn
[2:29:47] and when do you need it?" He listed
[2:29:50] everything. I said, "In the name of
[2:29:52] Jesus Christ, I give it to you."
[2:29:56] [laughter]
[2:29:57] At the he asked for it, how much he
[2:30:00] wanted to ask, when he wanted to get it,
[2:30:04] it worked out 100%.
[2:30:08] and he came back here I think in one of
[2:30:10] the meetings here to give me the
[2:30:12] testimony where we don't run testimony
[2:30:15] shows and everything but you know he
[2:30:17] came and gave me the testimony
[2:30:21] and he said now pastor there is a
[2:30:24] problem in that job
[2:30:27] now I need to be h promoted
[2:30:31] I told him when [laughter] he said when
[2:30:35] I said I give it to you in Jesus
[2:30:38] Just one or two days he called me he
[2:30:40] said I've been promoted
[2:30:44] look we all have that
[2:30:48] why if you're a son of God
[2:30:51] if you're a son of God I remember there
[2:30:54] was a season here you know the presence
[2:30:57] of God came down and we're asking you
[2:31:00] know the spirit of God asked many of us
[2:31:03] whatever you need you shall have it if
[2:31:06] you need clothes, you'll have them. So,
[2:31:08] how many need clothes? Everybody raise
[2:31:11] up your hands. All right, receive the
[2:31:12] clothes. I I received testimonies until
[2:31:15] I got tired.
[2:31:18] Clothes after clothes after clothes. If
[2:31:20] you shall say to this mountain, be
[2:31:22] removed from this place and be planted
[2:31:25] out yonder. It shall happen. Why? Not
[2:31:29] because you are presuming or thinking,
[2:31:33] but you are just speaking
[2:31:35] by authority.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; As a son of God, [screaming]
[2:31:41] praise God.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How many believe that?
[2:31:46] Amen.
[2:31:48] Praise God. Let us stand on our feet.
[2:32:00] I'm I'm going to speak a part part two
[2:32:02] of this on Wednesday, the Lord willing,
[2:32:07] and take you on another phase of that.
[2:32:10] Show you how being bound by the system
[2:32:15] can make you fail to understand who you
[2:32:17] are.
[2:32:22] And the spirit of God in this end time
[2:32:26] is calling on us. Come out [screaming]
[2:32:28] of h people. Be not partakers of our
[2:32:31] sins.
[2:32:33] Praise God.
[2:32:36] Amen. I'd like us to sing He Made a Way.
[2:32:40] If the musicians can come.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[2:58:26] Brother Bal needs us to remember him.
[2:58:28] He'll be traveling back today to Morto.
[2:58:34] So let's just bow our heads right
[2:58:35] [music] now and pray.
[2:58:38] Lord Jesus, we commit our brother Andrew
[2:58:40] as he's going to be traveling today,
[2:58:45] Lord, to take that long journey
[2:58:47] tomorrow.
[2:58:50] We commit him into your hands.
[2:58:52] Lord, not only for traveling masses,
[2:58:56] but also for protection while therement
[2:58:59] and put grace around him, Father. and
[2:59:03] and as you've kept him the rest of the
[2:59:05] week months
[2:59:08] and continue to [music] keep him there
[2:59:09] fast for the glory of God and also while
[2:59:13] he's away you may keep his family
[2:59:16] bless him Lord and his in Jesus name
[2:59:20] amen
[2:59:22] there is a a request here um for [music]
[2:59:26] and I'm happy whenever I get things like
[2:59:28] this
[2:59:31] &gt;&gt; that means you're listening
[2:59:33] Uh there's someone who is saying pastor
[2:59:36] you spoke about the death of Jesus
[2:59:38] Christ
[2:59:41] &gt;&gt; and he said that there was an end of the
[2:59:44] Jews life
[2:59:49] and he is looking for the bride.
[2:59:54] If I may ask
[2:59:57] for the Jews their life is not counted
[2:59:59] by God.
[3:00:02] till when he will come back.
[3:00:05] Please help me and explain more about
[3:00:07] it.
[3:00:09] First of all, you misunderstood me.
[3:00:12] I did not say that when Jesus Christ
[3:00:15] died, it marked the end of Jewish life.
[3:00:22] I said that after the death of Jesus,
[3:00:27] the times the seasons of the Jews was
[3:00:30] over
[3:00:34] meaning for God to work with them.
[3:00:40] He blind them. That's why they did not
[3:00:44] recognize that Jesus was the Messiah.
[3:00:48] So as far as God is concerned
[3:00:51] and as far as faith is concerned,
[3:00:54] God no longer works with the Jews from
[3:00:56] that time.
[3:01:00] Because remember with the Jews, he
[3:01:02] always deals with them as a nation
[3:01:07] with us as individuals.
[3:01:12] And so the Bible says in Romans 11 that
[3:01:14] they were blinded for your sake.
[3:01:18] until the fullness of the Gentiles
[3:01:20] become
[3:01:23] the fullness of the Gentiles will be
[3:01:25] coming
[3:01:27] and it will be marked. I already here
[3:01:30] actually
[3:01:33] but it will be marked the end of it will
[3:01:35] be marked by the rapture.
[3:01:40] After the rapture,
[3:01:43] then the two witnesses will go to the
[3:01:45] Jews.
[3:01:48] Now God will begin to work with them
[3:01:50] again.
[3:01:53] You know, they will be they will go
[3:01:54] there for the calling of the 144,000
[3:01:57] years.
[3:02:03] The Bible talks about those Jews who
[3:02:05] will be saved
[3:02:08] and and the number is 144,000 Jews.
[3:02:15] 12,000 out of each tribe.
[3:02:19] Is that 12,000?
[3:02:23] Yes. So uh that will be the one that
[3:02:25] will be saved
[3:02:28] because remember there 12 tribes
[3:02:32] but out of each tribe will come 12,000
[3:02:37] but you see they will they will come to
[3:02:39] the knowledge of the truth
[3:02:43] by the witness of those two witness.
[3:02:50] Right now generally God is no longer
[3:02:54] dealing with it.
[3:02:58] I've quite a few Jews myself.
[3:03:02] They are just most of them areists even
[3:03:07] a few are you know following the
[3:03:09] Judaism.
[3:03:13] Yeah. So but because they're blinded
[3:03:16] they're really blinded. So that's that's
[3:03:19] what I meant.
[3:03:20] I hope that it explains it.
[3:03:25] Well, God bless you. We'll be here once
[3:03:28] again on uh on on Wednesday.
[3:03:31] Please come on time,
[3:03:34] 6 p.m. Wednesday.
