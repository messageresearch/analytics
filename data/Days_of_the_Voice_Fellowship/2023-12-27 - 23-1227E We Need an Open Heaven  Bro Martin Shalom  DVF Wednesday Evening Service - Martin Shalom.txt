on the way they are coming back so hopefully they'll reach in the evening maybe in the late evening Genesis 28: 11 if you are there say Amen uh and he and he lighted upon a certain place and Ted there all night because the sun was set and he took of the stone of the place and put them for his pillow and lay down in that place to sleep and it dreamed and behold the lad set up on the earth and the top of the the top of it reaches to heaven and behold the angel of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac the land where there on thou liest to thee will I give it unto thy seed and they and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shall spread shall spread abroad to the west and to the East and to the north and to the South and in thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed Lord Jesus we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read we ask you Lord Jesus that may you come Lord and just speak to that Soul speak to my soul as well take me out of the way just come Lord and Whisper the word of encouragement to us Lord Jesus father we thank you in Christ Jesus we pray amen men may have your seats Christmas yeah what you say cras uh this evening I just have some uh thought that I want us to share in maybe like one hour and you pray for me as I told you now that's my consolation that God knew amen yeah so I want us to I'm going to call my text tonight that you need an open Heaven amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's all that we need in this life when a Believer prays or goes before God and Heavens open brother sister that's all we need amen and even as we coming to the end of this year what's going to keep us moving what's going to push us through the year is that open heaven blessed be the name of the Lord you know when Heaven opens something happens praise the Lord When Heaven opens it's not just opening for the sake of opening but when God opens Heaven he opens when he want to say something and when God speaks something happens blessed be the name of the Lord and where we have read in Genesis this is the uh it is the story of Jacob and this is what happened amen this is not the story of it's not a fable stories blessed be the name of the Lord but when we are talking about what is written in the Bible this is the sure word of Prophecy and whatever is written here it is not just a story but this is what happened amen when God spoke in the beginning that the prophet say that God believed his word and the world came into existence that's why without faith it is impossible to please God Amen so when we come before God we have to come believing that God is going to speak and when God speaks to us we have to take it as a serious thing amen praise the Lord so yeah where we have read you remember the the story of Jacob and Esau how Jacob stole his brother's Birthright but we know that how God had per passed before the foundation of the world that before Jacob was born the Bible says that God hated Esau and loved Jacob for his reasons amen not Jacob's reason but God's reason God loved Jacob and hated Esau and the sacred was with her mother Rebecca praise be to God Amen because you remember that she had battle in her womb until she had no peace the bible say that she went to the temple to ask God of what was happening in her womb and the Lord spoke to her and told her that in your womb you have two Nations and say that but the Elder Shall Serve the younger amen so she came back when she had already gotten the answer what do we see from there that when we have a troubl situation around us amen the right place to go is in the house of God is to go in the temple of God and inquire from the Lord blessed be the name of the Lord and God always want us to inquire from him you remember in the Bible when God rejected soul and so when to the witch of endo to inquire about what the Lord was speaking about him can you imagine blessed be the name of the Lord and God no I think it was I believe it was Ahab Saul yes it was Saul he went to inquire and the same thing happened to Ahab when Ahab sent his servants to go and consult and the Bible says God spoke to Elijah and told him to go and meet those Servants of Ahab and when he met them he asked them is there no God in Israel that you're are going to consult blessed be the name of the Lord so God always want us to consult from him praise be to God back to our sharing here we're seeing and uh time came for Jacob he had run home he sto his brother's Birthright and he went to laban's place where he was he stole from Laban by using his tricks and he had gathered a lot and not only that he had worn now two daughters of leban blessed be the name of the Lord and time had come for him to go back praise the Lord but remember where he was coming from so and where he was supposed to go he had issues to set out from the other side so he was in the middle there blessed be the name of the Lord but remember God had spoken to the mother that the Elder Shall Serve the younger and when month when Rebecca knew when he heard that Jacob wanted to bless he son he you know all the trick she played the role she played blessed be the name of the Lord and then Jacob things were just okay with him so he went to Le so from there he used this tricks and things were just okay but God wanted to meet Jacob blessed be the name of the Lord God wanted to have time with Jacob and they talk about this promise amen each one of us God want to meet us at a certain point and discuss with us about this promise brother Peter try to I need more voice I feel like I'm using a lot of energy amen blessed be the name of the Lord and here where we have read if you come up here see then went Esau unto Ishmael and took unto the wives which he had mahalala the daughter of ishma Abraham's son the sister of of neba to be his wife and Jacob went out from BBA and went toward Haron and he lighted up a certain place and Ted there all night because the sun was set and he took off a stone of a place and put them for his pillow and laid down in that place to sleep and he dreamed remember you need an open Heaven Jacob reached a point when deals could no longer serve him Jacob loved God inside his heart but things were not working out for him why he had not taken his time to do inventory in his life and that's what God wanted amen so time came brother we have the promise and our Prophet tells us that we have to fight for every inch of these promises but not until we understand that we do have them and they are for R and we must do something toward it blessed be the name of the Lord am so Jacob reached that point he wanted to go back he was chased from where he was and fin enough when they were living the daughters told their father's Gods amen he raised problem from either side but as long as you still have a mind brother time will come time is going to come when God will block all those Avenues why because he want us to look unto him he said look unto me all the ends of the world and the prophet says in that message that every time when the world is coming to an end there is a voice calling us to look unto Jesus amen he tells us to lay aside every weight and every sin that do easily beset us that to run this rest with patience looking unto Jesus praise me to God so that evening Jacob was troubled and Jacob had no other option but inside Jacob's heart there was a seed of God there was a voice speaking to him many times before we go deep into things that we are deep into maybe it is sin maybe it is trouble there is a voice which always warns us before we go deeper but most time we realize when we are already far amen and that's where the devil want you when you look back you see it's very far to come out of thetion you are in blessed be the name of the Lord but each one of us we have that voice at a certain point in the message from that time the prophet says that everything has a point when it started in our life whether good or bad he said you can still remember the first lie you have ever told and when you told when you spoke that lie you added you kept on lying and lying and lying today today you can even sit and cook a talk of habits in our lives talk of fornication for those who do fornicate there's a point when it started and you disobeyed The Voice amen the prophet calls it that red flag the conviction in our heart is God's red flag which you put in our heart but when you disobeyed that you found you realize oh found s like it's no longer bothering you you fornicate every time you want to fornicate blessed be the name of the Lord but there is a point you reach and you feel uhuh this is not a Christian Life something must happen What can I do that is the point I'm talking about right now amen and the only solution is you need an open Heaven that is where your answer is you need to encounter God you can call it personal experience with God blessed be the name of the Lord and when you need when you encounter that open Heaven brother that changes the whole story that changes each and everything in your life blessed be the name of the Lord and he dreamed and behold a light set upon on earth and the top of it reached heaven and behold the angel of God ascending and descending on it there is a point we must reach amen where the angels of God ascending and descending that is where God want us to reach because the prophet say that angels are ministering Spirits they are here to minister to Us beside the preaches stand on the pulpit but God's angels they are to serve as the bride and God want us to reach somewhere amen where are the angels are descending and ascending 20 and behold the Lord stood above it on the top of the ladder God was standing above it amen and said I the Lord God of Abraham thy father in the god of Isaac in the land where thou liest to thee will I give it andto thy seed this man was thinking about about the The Inheritance which he told from his brother but God is revealing it to him now amen when he encountered the open Heaven God started to reveal to him things he did not know amen that this was not only about the inheritance but even the land where thou liest right now amen I have given it to thee amen when God reveals himself to us he start to reveal to manifest to us the things we did not know blessed be the name of the Lord amen there on to thee will I give it to will I give it and to thy seed not only to him and to his seed blessed be the name of the Lord you remember John the Baptist when Jesus appeared on the scene when John was baptizing in Matthew uh is Matthew 3:4 we shall read there can you go to Matthew chapter 3: 14 Matthew 3:14 no I think I'm missing it three oh sorry I I was reading I was wondering I was in another scripture Matthew 3:14 we can start from that he says and then cometh Jesus From Galilee to Jordan and to John to be baptized of him but John forbid him saying I have need to be baptized of thee and come th thou to me and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were open unto him amen after all the scripture was fulfilled because John he tried to refuse say you're the one who is greater than me but Jesus told him suffer it to be so because it be cometh us to fulfill all the righteousness of God and after the righteousness of God was fulfilled something happened and John baptized him and Jesus when he was baptized went out straight away out of the water and lo all Heaven were open unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dve and lighten upon him blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus to continue with his ministry something had to happen amen and when Jesus was baptized coming out of the water heaven was open he engaged another gear in other words blessed be the name of the Lord Even in our Christian walk brother sister we need heaven to open for us we need that experience that is what is going to keep us going because after Jesus was baptized the Bible says he was led in the wilderness to be tempted of the devil he had already had what was more than enough to defeat the enemy blessed be the name of the Lord the same thing happened to Jacob when he got that dream amen something happened in his life that fear went amen and from that time Jacob was the changed man blessed be the name of the Lord what caused that it was open Heaven praise be to God and I'm telling you my brothers my sister as we approaching the end of this year we need open Heaven that is what we are that's what we need tonight amen every home need open Heaven every brother need open Heaven every sister need open Heaven amen because when Heaven opens Supernaturals will start taking place amen When Heaven opens healing will take over when Heaven opens Vision will burst in our midst When Heaven open tongues and interpretation will happen in our midst amen Heaven does not just open for excitement but God most time he comes to vindicate himself to us because the Bible says in HEB in Romans that it's not God of the dead but is God of the living and some of the characteristics of the living beings you know them amen we must have Christians who are sure that their God is living God want to speak to us lips to ear he want to speak to us in many ways amen we must have that Upper Room experience which is the open Heaven blessed be the name of the Lord and God has always worked like that even during the time of Elijah after he stopped the rain for three and a half years amen and when he open the rain again blessed be the name of the Lord something happened in the sky amen praise be to God Heaven hard to open why because heaven had opened amen and rain was going to rain on the earth after three and a half years and what the church need tonight we need the open heaven we need the outpouring of Pentecost not only on the out being amen but we need the life changing experience in our soul which comes with open Heaven blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah amen when Jesus came out of the water brother sister Heaven open and the voice spoke this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well placed to to dwell in he him amen When Heaven opens there is a voice saying he him because he my beloved Son whom I'm well pleased to dwell into blessed be the name of the Lord so what do we need tonight we need open Heaven each one of us that's what you need brother sister our young students you need to open heaven to push you at school to protect you amen every time you feel like the heaven is closed you need to go somewhere kneel before God intercede amen and when Heaven opens you'll come out there when you are charged blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah and Jesus answering said unto him suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all the righteousness then he suffered him blessed be the name of the Lord and John chapter 1: 51 says and he says unto him very ver unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the son of man amen When Heaven opens brother sister When Heaven opens to a sister or to a brother you will see nothing other than Angels descending and ascending upon you amen this is Jesus's word in John chapter 1 vers 15 Jesus himself speaking to them that when Heaven open that and he says unto them John chapter 1 ver 51 this was Jesus encounter with nathel and he told him when Jesus discerned him and said behold an Israelite indeed in whom there's no gu NE said unto him West thou knowest thou me and Jesus answered and said unto him before that Philip called thee when thou was under the fig tree I saw thee and nathel answered and said unto him rabi Thou Art the Son of God and thou are the king of Israel and Jesus answered and said unto him behold because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree believeth thou believest though thou shallal see greater things than this and he said unto him really really I say unto you the greater things Jesus is now trying is expanding to him amen after he after he was discerned by the word after you are discerned by the word and now you believe that it was not man but the word of God Discerning your heart and Jesus told him if you believe this greater thing are yet to happen blessed be the name of the Lord when you believe the message greater things are yet to happen amen Jesus was the voice in that time and nathel came he got an encounter with the word of his time and Jesus told him if you believe amen greater things are yet to happen and what are those great things really very really he was putting emphasis here I said unto you Hereafter you shall see Heaven open brother sister it has not stop with only believing the word and putting on long skirts and putting on long hair amen there are things which are more than that heaven will have to open amen and God's blessings will have to rain Upon Us blessed be the name of the Lord and the angel of God sending and ascending upon the son of man praise the Lord in the message the unchangeable word of God the prophet says see what kind of a home an angel comes to a home that keeps the Commandments of God A Home of a people that walked upright before God and if you want the horor of the Angel visiting your homes amen angels can visit our homes literal angels angels have visited Believers home you know we have to reach we have to reach to a point whereby these things are not imagination because angels are real being they are real amen but why are we not seeing them because we have not set our heart we have not asked God to see them amen but if we do the needful the prophet tells us we shall get the very result they got so he say that an angel comes to a home that keeps the Commandment number we must keep the Commandment of God in our homes of home of people walks upright before God and if you want the Horn of the Angel visiting your home having home ready for him to visit prepare amen prepared and ready under the blood of the Lamb you want God to visit that home let us prepare be sure that you are under the blood of the lamp the angels will Vis that home brother have you ever seen an angel yes are you talking of the minister not the minister but the real angels blessed be the name of the Lord they are real and they're the one who God us every now and then even when we are walking multiple times sometime you're walking on the road and you're listening to the message do you think that the devil is happy no it is the Angel of the Lord protecting you against accident and other attacks very many times the devil has tried to destroy you but the angel of the Lord has been there for you the blood of Jesus has always been there for you very many time the devil speaks bad words against us but the Bible says the blood of Jesus speaks of good words the devil is a Chooser of Brethren he was before God choosing Jacob amen and God was listening he did not know that God had another plan that very evening maybe in the morning the devil was there buing like a green fly God you see Jacob you said you see Jacob you know the devil does not know what your thought is not until you speak it out but in God's mind God already had a preparation for Jacob I believe that day Jacob had the most trouble day but later did he know that in the evening time glory amen something was going to happen there shall be light in the evening time so Jacob was troubled but sometime something in Jacob's heart was telling him the Victor is just knocking at the door and the prophet says before the dead Dawn there is that gross Darkness amen but whenever you see that cross cross Darkness it is a sign that the light is coming somewhere just wait a minute when the light sprangs out the darkness will have to flee amen so Jacob was in that L time I think I believe he was now repenting oh God I toldo my brother's Birthright oh god I've cheated from Laban oh God even I don't know and the Wes that had another problem they had stolen the strange God their father's R so the man did not even know and when realized that the Bible says he came running after them and this girl the devil can anoint somebody the devil can when the father of this girl came one girl refused to come out of the earth she was Seated on the like this you see but when Jacob met when the heaven was open amen and they saw the Angels brother that settled everything Jacob knew and from that time started singing because he had encountered his maker he had an encounter with God Amen and the devil could not hold him any longer he was now a changed man he had courage to confront his brother amen after he said his family all his well and all failed God knew that Jacob needed open Heaven talk of Anna in the Bible she was troubled for years every time the the the call maybe she was giving birth every year it is possible women can give birth every year and she was giving birth every year maybe and Anna was there traed and erana was trying his best to play his part by giving her the bigger portion of each and everything that he gets but that could not satisfy Anna blessed be the name of the Lord her Joy was in a child praise be to God and Anna knew that something has to happen something must to be done many time when we look at our situation and take them for granted it will hold longer amen because you realize in your Christian Life that most time when you come out to react against Str that's when God comes down but when you just seated and it's okay with you brother even God will sit not until you realize that I have a promise holy life belong to me amen and when that comes in your soul you will start to work toward it say God I'm going to do my part and I leave the rest to you and that's when the spachos will start to happen because you have set your heart to understand or to walk in the way of God Amen so time came and Anna could not B it any longer he said upon us something must happen and God was watching amen our unseriousness will keep us longer out of the promised land because the promise is ours God has given us each and everything he has given us potential to live a holy life he has given us ability authority over demons to tr over a serpent to take on the deadly things to cast out demons amen but you will be troubled by demons not until you know that uhuh enough is enough and when you react upon that God will honor your action she went to the temple and most time there when we are praying for something and it's like the prayer is not going beyond the ceiling but brother let me tell you let us keep on let us keep on pushing amen it's just like a little chick in the egg taking over that shell egg shell amen it back from the inside and you may you may think that there's nothing happening but when in actual sense it happens the mother Chek mother hen will never help the chick to come out of the egg blessed be the name of the Lord never what will the mother chiek do it will provide the right atmosphere because the hand Knows by Nature that inside that egg that chick has a potential in it to break out of that egg amen so God knows very well brother sister that inside your soul you have got enough potential to come out of that situation if you can only believe in the word and he will wait for you until you are fed up of thetion and say no come and that is the resolution that is the determination we have to make as we approaching this year not only enjoying because God knows very well that inside us he has given us his sure word amen that cannot fail and he knows you and me we can come out of it blessed be the name of the Lord God knows very well so time came for Hanah to go in the temple and I believe that when the time of the prophecy is nearing something happen amen unusual thing will happen even the day you got that Holy Ghost that day you had that experience you can tell I woke up that day oh my brother it was like I knew today something is going to happen you will have that that Glimpse blessed be the name of the Lord and that's why the prophet said that we shall know when the Rapture is nearing we are going to see those Saints amen because in his com first coming they walked for 40 days and they saw them and they knew that those were them and amen am praise the Lord he talks of the ducks that when the winter is coming they blessed be the name of the Lord when the Rapture is nearing amen maybe that last week brother sister something will happen heaven will open wider amen the spachos they are happening right now yes the healings are taking place yes but when that time is here it will be different story brother sister you will realize that all along God has been building you every time you come in the presence of God Amen it is a flight to remember every time you come God is parking you he shakes you and tighten the loose area amen preparing you for the flight I believe that morning the pain was so much the agony was so much in her heart said my husband just feel I'm going to have some time at the temple alone and then they kind of say okay may God bless you be unto you and then she went in the temple she came and knelt like here started praying she prayed amen for all El she was baring she was hitting un something and a barrier and she did not know that that prayer was going through amen the cracks was coming she kept on hitting amen she kept from hammering through prayer and fasting through worshiping and one day Hallelujah God used a priest oh [Applause] brother when God is to answer your prayers God has his ways of doing it it may come from the person you did not like in your life and tell his brother that saves the Lord your problem is settled when the priest came in the temple this man knew the agony the sorrow of this woman for so long because she was a member of that Fellowship but when he came instead of sympathizing with her the devil will test to to your last minute that was a test to her when the man came the servant of God came in the temple and asked her the devil had to maybe Satan was trying to tell God that but even now you try hand see blessed be the name of the Lord that was the last bullet she was going to shoot the Lord spoke to her through the priest and told her that next year this time you are going to have a son praise be to God Amen When Heaven opens Supernatural took place praise the Lord and she left there believing I believe the burden was off lording and then she came back Hallelujah maybe she was singing Hallelujah I have found him oh my soul so long hey and maybe the husband was coming you know being that he loved our so much I trust maybe he had prepared some nice

through through the priest and told Anna that you're going to give birth and Anna had voted with God that if you give a son I will give him back to you no devil could tamper with that prance neither with that womb amen because there is an angel of the Lord who was following that child every time someone changed in the womb the angel was there observing and watching amen you know being that she had taken long without giving her birth she was Barren the devil will preach all the sermons to you I was talking this evening with my sister Fiona there and she was saying how the devil after she has listened to the word most times she listen to the message she enjoys it and she say always my expectation is high and after she has listened to the word the Devil comes and tell uhhuh now uh-huh is

prayer was answered many time our prayers already answered but the devil is still trying to hold it but I want to tell you brother sister let us strike the opening heaven and you see amen and when that young man was in the womb of the mother the Bible says we were predestinated before the foundation of the world Amen there is that blood line the family we are coming from amen the devil could not even PL just a mere leave because the angel of the Lord was watching and the pr say that when God heals us from one disease we cannot suffer of that same disease again so count how many diseases

thing God did when he came down when the omnipotent speaks the miraculous take place when the OM poent speak brother sister the miraculous take place I was out on the side of the Hill one day when a man 80 years and uh whiskers who had disobeyed God and God came down in the likeness in the power of the Angel and spoke to him in the burning bush what was it it was the time for the prophet to appear it was the time for the angel to appear it was at the end time the junction of the road guess what what time are we living in amen we are living in the same time we're in the Third Exodus God met Moses in the burning bush When Heaven opens Moses saw the bush burning blessed be the name of the Lord on the other Hill of Yonder he said God see that God came down in a likeness and the power of the Angel and spoke to him in the burning bush God came down the same likeness in these last days through Malachi 4 and spoke to us amen what was it the time for the prophet to appear it was the time for angels to appear this is the time for the angel to appear again amen the word has been preached for all the years it is the time ever since the message came we receive the message now is the time

black as the as the smart walls of Hell says the prophet pretending as the smarty walls as the smarty walls of Hell there's many pastoring today that should be out yonder cutting corn or something better off but thank God he gave us a good pastor he says Jemiah I will give you pastors after my own heart amen and they will feed you with the right word but there are men outside there in the
