[1:32:17] we are gathered together in the sight of
[1:32:18] God today
[1:32:22] and in the presence of these witnesses
[1:32:25] to join together Joseph Mary and Mariam
[1:32:34] in the bonds of holy matrimony.
[1:32:37] according to the ordinance of God,
[1:32:41] the custom of the Christian church,
[1:32:45] the laws of this nation,
[1:32:48] and to implore on their behalf the
[1:32:50] blessing of God.
[1:32:54] Now, before we proceed, I just maybe ask
[1:32:56] brother Joseph to slowly move. Maybe you
[1:32:59] can give us a song.
[1:33:04] Just bring his bride up so that
[1:33:05] everybody can see properly.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; Can we have a song please?
[1:33:17] Maybe they just the singers can sing.
[1:33:19] Brother Shalom.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; me
[1:33:32] [singing]
[1:33:35] [music]
[1:33:37] and then nothing
[1:33:40] [music]
[1:33:41] else would [singing]
[1:33:44] you. You know, love
[1:33:48] me. [music and singing]
[1:33:49] Heat. Heat. Heat.
[1:33:58] [music and singing]
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; [music]
[1:34:06] &gt;&gt; Nothing [singing]
[1:34:07] else would do you know [music] love
[1:34:14] me.
[1:34:16] [music]
[1:34:19] Amen. Praise the Lord.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Except the uh the Lord build the house.
[1:34:30] the labor in vain that build it.
[1:34:34] So we are here
[1:34:36] to implore the blessing of God because
[1:34:38] it is God who builds a house.
[1:34:44] Marriage is honorable and holy asset
[1:34:47] instituted by God in the garden of Eden.
[1:34:52] It was there that the Lord God said,
[1:34:56] "It is not good that man should be
[1:34:59] alone."
[1:35:02] Eve was then fashioned from the rib of
[1:35:04] Adam.
[1:35:08] and give unto him for a wife.
[1:35:11] And then it was recorded that therefore
[1:35:13] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:35:19] and shall cleave unto his wife,
[1:35:22] and they shall be one flesh.
[1:35:25] It is sanctioned and honored by Jesus
[1:35:27] Christ's presence at the marriage in
[1:35:28] Cana,
[1:35:33] which is really a type of Christ and his
[1:35:35] church.
[1:35:38] So God ordains it as the foundation and
[1:35:41] bond of family life
[1:35:49] for the mutual help and comfort of a
[1:35:51] husband and wife
[1:35:54] and for the welfare of the state.
[1:35:58] Marriage therefore
[1:36:00] is not to be entered in unadvisably
[1:36:06] lightly,
[1:36:08] but it should be entered into
[1:36:09] reverently,
[1:36:12] discreetly,
[1:36:14] soberly,
[1:36:16] and in the fear of God.
[1:36:18] So into this holy estate these two
[1:36:20] people uh these two persons now desire
[1:36:22] to enter
[1:36:26] by being joined together as one.
[1:36:29] Therefore if any man can show any just
[1:36:32] cause
[1:36:35] why they may not lawfully be joined
[1:36:37] together.
[1:36:40] Please declare it now.
[1:36:44] Just look around in the room to make
[1:36:45] sure that there's no one there.
[1:36:51] Now,
[1:36:53] if you're not there now
[1:36:56] and say forever, hold your peace.
[1:37:02] Amen. Moreover, I charge you both
[1:37:06] before God in search of all hearts
[1:37:10] that if either of you know of any
[1:37:12] impediment why you may not lawfully be
[1:37:14] united in marriage.
[1:37:21] Now you confess
[1:37:28] be sure that you will surely answer the
[1:37:30] day of judgment.
[1:37:33] when the secrets of all heart shall be
[1:37:35] disclosed.
[1:37:38] If there is either of you that know of
[1:37:39] any impendment,
[1:37:42] why you should not be lawfully joined
[1:37:44] together in this.
[1:37:47] You also are sure that so many as are
[1:37:49] joined together otherwise and God's word
[1:37:51] does allow.
[1:37:57] They are not united by the Lord.
[1:38:01] Neither is their marriage blessed by
[1:38:07] I'd like us to pray before you are
[1:38:08] seated
[1:38:11] and then usually I just take it to the
[1:38:13] word first but uh you know the couple
[1:38:16] today has desired that I do the wedding
[1:38:18] first the
[1:38:25] so let us humble ourselves and pray
[1:38:28] a loving Jesus author
[1:38:31] of life.
[1:38:33] Lord, we are here this morning
[1:38:36] in honor of your word.
[1:38:39] We have heard you know that marriage
[1:38:40] started with you
[1:38:43] for you started this institution.
[1:38:48] Lord, for the mutual comfort of husband
[1:38:50] and wife,
[1:38:53] for them to be able to have a unit, a
[1:38:56] family unit where they can Lord serve
[1:38:58] you.
[1:39:01] the ambassadors of the kingdom of God.
[1:39:05] Raise up, Lord, a family that will
[1:39:07] worship you and live for you.
[1:39:12] Lord, we are so thankful this morning,
[1:39:15] for brother Joseph, and for sister
[1:39:17] Mariam and for their decision that they
[1:39:21] have made
[1:39:23] to enter into this holiest day.
[1:39:26] I ask Lord your blessing upon this
[1:39:28] ceremony today,
[1:39:31] your grace
[1:39:32] and Lord upon the people that are

[1:41:39] the same reverently discreetly
[1:41:44] soberly
[1:41:48] in the fear of God.
[1:41:51] I'd like to propose to you the marriage
[1:41:53] concept.
[1:41:57] Our Lord Jesus Christ has given us his
[1:41:58] promise to always be with us.

[1:42:13] that you will now make.
[1:42:17] And so at this moment, I'd like to turn
[1:42:19] to you, brother Joseph,
[1:42:22] and to ask you a question.
[1:42:26] And yeah, I don't know if I can get an
[1:42:28] extra microphone.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; Joseph,
[1:42:39] do you take Mariam
[1:42:44] to be your wife to live together
[1:42:46] according to God's ordinance in holy
[1:42:48] state of matrimony?
[1:42:52] Will you love her?
[1:42:55] I just don't. I know it's a ceremony,
[1:42:56] but I want you to listen to these words
[1:42:59] carefully.
[1:43:02] No stress,
[1:43:06] internalize everything.
[1:43:11] Will you love her?
[1:43:13] Will you comfort her? Will you honor and
[1:43:16] keep her
[1:43:19] in sickness and in health
[1:43:22] and forsaking all others
[1:43:25] faithfully keeping yourself to her
[1:43:27] alone?
[1:43:29] As long as both of you shall leave,
[1:43:37] did you hear?
[1:43:41] Oh, praise God.
[1:43:45] Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Well, then maybe you can pass the
[1:43:48] microphone to
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; Sister Mariam.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Do you accept Joseph Mary to be your
[1:43:57] husband? Joseph
[1:44:00] to live together according to God's
[1:44:02] ordinance
[1:44:04] in the holy set of matrimony.
[1:44:07] Will you love him,
[1:44:10] comfort him,
[1:44:12] honor and keep him
[1:44:16] in sickness [snorts]
[1:44:18] and in health
[1:44:20] and forsaking all others
[1:44:23] faithfully faithfully keep yourself to
[1:44:27] him alone
[1:44:31] as long as you both shall live?
[1:44:35] Yes, I will.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; All right. She said she will.
[1:44:40] [applause]
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. And
[1:44:43] &gt;&gt; well, there's different ways of doing
[1:44:45] it,
[1:44:48] but I'd like, you know, for them to take
[1:44:50] their vows when Joseph is seeing her
[1:44:54] clearly.
[1:44:58] So, if you can step forward and slowly
[1:45:01] take off the veil,
[1:45:05] unveil your bride
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; and then you can give her your promises

[1:57:25] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:34] Hallelujah.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; You know, it's a joy of the parents
[1:57:43] and the pastors
[1:57:45] whenever young people, you know, get to
[1:57:47] get to this level of their life
[1:57:52] and um, you know, time is already fast
[1:57:54] spent according to their program.
[1:57:57] for maybe 20 or 30 minutes.
[1:58:00] I just want to you to give me your
[1:58:02] undivided attention.
[1:58:04] I've never done it this way before
[1:58:08] to you know I always first give the word
[1:58:12] but I think this is better
[1:58:14] because then they are relaxed
[1:58:18] and they can hear the word.
[1:58:20] So let us now get into the scriptures
[1:58:24] and I just want to to share just a
[1:58:25] little thought on giving in love.
[1:58:32] John 3:16.
[1:58:35] For God so loved the world
[1:58:39] that he gave
[1:58:41] his only begotten son
[1:58:45] that whosoever believeth in him
[1:58:48] should not perish but have everlasting
[1:58:51] life.
[1:58:53] Now you cannot love.
[1:58:55] Now I'm meant to speak to them.
[1:58:58] So let me change my position.
[1:59:04] so that I can be in a place where they
[1:59:07] can see me well.
[1:59:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. So where I can see you well I'm
[1:59:15] addressing you although they are
[1:59:16] witnesses.
[1:59:18] So you cannot love and I I think you
[1:59:21] chose a very good song.
[1:59:24] have lifted me. But you cannot love
[1:59:28] and and without giving. You cannot love
[1:59:32] and not give.
[1:59:35] Or you cannot give
[1:59:37] if you do not love.
[1:59:39] For God so loved the world.
[1:59:42] When he loved the world, what did he
[1:59:43] give? He gave his only begotten son. So
[1:59:48] love and giving is embedded together.
[1:59:53] Now God expressed his love for us in
[1:59:55] Christ.
[1:59:58] And then in Romans 8, he says, "What
[2:00:00] shall we say to these things?
[2:00:04] If God be for us, who can be against
[2:00:07] us?" I believe Mariam can say this
[2:00:10] morning,
[2:00:11] "If Joseph be for me, who can be against
[2:00:15] me?" Why? Because he knows that Joseph
[2:00:17] loves him loves her. So he that he that
[2:00:21] spared not his own son,
[2:00:25] but delivered him up for us all.
[2:00:30] How shall he not with him also freely
[2:00:34] GIVE US ALL THINGS?
[2:00:42] Shall lay anything to the charge of
[2:00:43] God's.
[2:00:47] It is God that justify
[2:00:50] Because of the love God had for his ill,
[2:00:54] he could not hold back.
[2:00:57] He could not spare HIS SON.
[2:01:00] HE willingly delivered him for us all.
[2:01:05] His son was an expression of his
[2:01:07] thoughts
[2:01:11] and character.
[2:01:13] It was God himself made manifest in the
[2:01:16] flesh.
[2:01:19] You know in John uh John John 1 it says
[2:01:21] in the beginning was the word.
[2:01:24] The word was with God and the word was
[2:01:26] God. The same was in the beginning with
[2:01:29] God.
[2:01:31] All things were made by him and without
[2:01:34] him was not anything made that.
[2:01:39] And now listen. He says and the word was
[2:01:41] made flesh
[2:01:44] and dwelt among us. And we beheld his
[2:01:47] glory,
[2:01:48] the glory of as of only begotten of the
[2:01:50] father
[2:01:53] full of grace and truth.
[2:01:56] I want you to see brother Joseph
[2:01:59] Mariam. First it was a thought then
[2:02:04] became the word
[2:02:06] and then came into manifestation.
[2:02:10] And 1 John 3:5 it says, "And ye know
[2:02:12] that he was manifested
[2:02:17] to take away our sins,
[2:02:21] and in him
[2:02:23] is no sin." Now the scripture says that
[2:02:25] he gave HIMSELF
[2:02:28] AS a ransom for all.
[2:02:32] Think about it. God himself coming in
[2:02:34] the likeness of sinful flesh.
[2:02:40] JESUS WAS NOT just a second person of
[2:02:42] the trinity.
[2:02:44] IT WAS GOD HIMSELF
[2:02:47] COMING in the likeness of sinful flesh
[2:02:51] so that he would condemn sin.
[2:02:55] What was it? It was love. It was love
[2:03:00] that brought him down to the earth.
[2:03:04] It was love that put him on the cross.
[2:03:07] IT WAS LOVE THAT TOOK HIM to the grave.
[2:03:11] It was love that took HIM TO THE LOWEST
[2:03:13] HELL.
[2:03:16] You know this kind of love never fails.
[2:03:20] He rose up triumphant
[2:03:23] and HE IS ALIVE TODAY
[2:03:25] and his love has drawn ALL OF US TO him
[2:03:30] and we can never fall away.
[2:03:34] SO BECAUSE HE LOVED US, [screaming] HE
[2:03:36] GAVE EVERYTHING.
[2:03:38] HE GAVE himself he gave everything.
[2:03:42] So when we say he gave he gave
[2:03:46] for God so loved the world that he gave
[2:03:49] his only begotten son. People think here
[2:03:52] was God and he gave someone else.
[2:03:58] He said, "Oh, I love those people so
[2:03:59] much. My child, go and die for me."
[2:04:03] That's not the way it was.
[2:04:07] Remember, it was a thought, then a word,
[2:04:12] then it came into manifestation.
[2:04:14] So Jesus was the thought of God
[2:04:17] expressed.
[2:04:20] That's why he's called the word OF GOD.
[2:04:24] SO IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS WAS GOD MADE
[2:04:27] MANIFEST in flesh.
[2:04:30] So in other words, God gave HIMSELF
[2:04:34] TO COME and die for the ones he loved.
[2:04:38] AND THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US
[2:04:40] TO be lost.
[2:04:44] It is even impossible for us, THOSE WHO
[2:04:46] HE DIED FOR,
[2:04:48] to be deceived.
[2:04:51] It is IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DECEIVED.
[2:04:54] WHY? Because of love.
[2:04:57] IMAGINE GOD HIMSELF COMING DOWN FROM
[2:05:01] glory
[2:05:03] living. You know in Philippians 2 he
[2:05:04] says let this mind be in you as it was
[2:05:09] in Christ Jesus who was in the form of
[2:05:11] God but told no rather to be evil than
[2:05:15] God
[2:05:16] but took upon himself
[2:05:19] the form of a servant
[2:05:22] and because he WAS FOUND IN A FASHION AS
[2:05:24] A MAN.
[2:05:27] HE was God but he was found in a fashion
[2:05:30] AS A MAN. SO WHAT did he do? He humbled
[2:05:33] himself
[2:05:35] and he died on the cross. What was that?
[2:05:39] That is what we call the love of God
[2:05:43] because he loved us. HE COULD NOT
[2:05:46] DELEGATE THIS WORK to an angel.
[2:05:50] You could not delegate this work to you
[2:05:52] know to a any human being
[2:05:56] because the Bible SAYS FOR ALL HAVE
[2:05:58] SINNED
[2:05:59] AND ALL HAVE come short of the glory OF
[2:06:01] GOD.
[2:06:03] SO there was no human being
[2:06:06] that could save us from sin.
[2:06:09] THERE WAS NO ANGEL.
[2:06:11] I want you to imagine
[2:06:14] when Adam and Eve sinned.
[2:06:16] I'm sure you know the all the angels
[2:06:19] must have wanted to come and save the
[2:06:20] day.
[2:06:22] BUT God told them, "This is mine to do.
[2:06:26] All of you hold your peace. You cannot
[2:06:29] go down there." THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT
[2:06:32] HE WAS GOING TO DO. GOD HAD A PLAN.
[2:06:36] And I will tell you WHAT THE PLAN WAS.
[2:06:39] THE PLAN WAS THAT HE HIMSELF WILL COME
[2:06:43] DOWN AND CONCERN AND HUMBLE HIMSELF IN
[2:06:46] HUMAN FLESH.
[2:06:49] THAT IS HOW MUCH HE LOVED. [screaming]
[2:06:53] HE GAVE HIMSELF.
[2:06:56] SO WHEN Jesus died, it was GOD DYING.
[2:07:01] NOW WE KNOW GOD CANNOT DIE. GOD CANNOT
[2:07:04] BELIEVE. SO THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO CREATE
[2:07:06] THAT FLESH.
[2:07:09] IN THE womb of Mary in order to bleed
[2:07:12] and die.
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; He gave himself.
[2:07:16] And here is another part
[2:07:19] when Adam, you know, the Bible says in
[2:07:21] Phil in first Timothy,
[2:07:24] it says chapter two that the woman
[2:07:29] listen was in the transgression
[2:07:33] not the man but the woman
[2:07:38] because when the serpent came, the
[2:07:41] serpent came to the woman and deceived
[2:07:44] her. And when the woman was deceived,
[2:07:48] then she came to her husband
[2:07:51] and told her about what happened.
[2:07:54] You see, Adam had a a choice
[2:07:58] to say, "No, I will not be a part of
[2:08:00] this."
[2:08:02] But you know what? Adam knew one thing.
[2:08:05] IF I PARTAKE OF WHAT MY WIFE HAS DONE,
[2:08:11] she will not die because I am her
[2:08:14] redeemer.
[2:08:16] But the reason why she cannot die
[2:08:19] because I also have a redeemer.
[2:08:22] REMEMBER ADAM WAS A PART of God.
[2:08:26] You know, GOD SPOKE HIM INTO EXISTENCE.
[2:08:29] HE WAS A PART OF GOD. He came from the
[2:08:31] thought and the mind of God.
[2:08:34] He was in the image and the likeness of
[2:08:36] God.
[2:08:38] SO NOW HE KNEW BECAUSE I'M A PART OF GOD
[2:08:41] FOR ME TO BE DESTROYED,
[2:08:44] IT MEANS GOD must be destroyed.
[2:08:47] BUT if I leave my woman, my wife to be
[2:08:49] destroyed.
[2:08:52] Well, she can be destroyed, but I cannot
[2:08:54] let her be DESTROYED BECAUSE ADAM
[2:08:57] [screaming] loved his wife.
[2:09:00] So what did HE DO? HE DECIDED, OH MY, HE
[2:09:03] DECIDED to give HIMSELF
[2:09:07] FOR HIS WIFE. ADAM KNEW WHAT HE WAS
[2:09:10] DOING.
[2:09:12] THAT [screaming] ACT WAS THE ACT OF
[2:09:14] REDEMPTION.
[2:09:16] He was redeeming her because he became a
[2:09:19] part of what she was.
[2:09:23] And when Adam fell,
[2:09:26] the entire human race FALL
[2:09:30] that's why you are born
[2:09:32] in sin
[2:09:35] without doing any wrong OR GOOD.
[2:09:38] YOU ARE a sinner.
[2:09:40] Can you IMAGINE THAT? BUT WHEN GOD SAW
[2:09:43] THAT HE SAID I CANNOT LEAVE MY PART,
[2:09:48] I CANNOT LEAVE MY SON TO DIE JUST LIKE
[2:09:51] THAT. AND THIS ACT CANNOT BE DONE BY AN
[2:09:53] ANGEL
[2:09:56] MYSELF. [screaming]
[2:09:57] I HAVE TO GO DOWN AND GIVE myself and
[2:10:01] and and REDEEM HIM. SO THAT'S WHY JESUS
[2:10:04] CHRIST IS GOD HIMSELF
[2:10:08] MANIFESTED IN FLESH TO REDEEM FALLEN
[2:10:11] MAN.
[2:10:13] THERE IS no love without giving.
[2:10:17] So what is love then?
[2:10:20] First John 4:16. We have known and
[2:10:22] believed that the love we have known and
[2:10:25] believed
[2:10:27] the the love that God has to us.
[2:10:31] Have you known and believed it?
[2:10:35] God is love.
[2:10:37] Tell your neighbor, God is love.
[2:10:40] And he that dwelleth in love
[2:10:43] DWELLETH IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM. THE
[2:10:48] PUREST FORM OF LOVE.
[2:10:51] IS GOD'S LOVE CALLED?
[2:10:56] That is God is love.
[2:10:58] THEN WE KNOW ALL THE OTHER FORMS THAT WE
[2:11:00] call love
[2:11:03] which is really at a much lower level.
[2:11:08] I want I want to quote for you
[2:11:09] something.
[2:11:11] William Brandham the prophet of God
[2:11:14] in 1958
[2:11:16] very outstanding.
[2:11:18] He said in 1958
[2:11:20] in a message he was preaching called Ye
[2:11:22] must be born again.
[2:11:25] I want you to listen. He says anything
[2:11:27] that had a beginning
[2:11:31] has an end.
[2:11:33] It is those things which have not a
[2:11:35] beginning.
[2:11:38] It has no end. Did you ever think of
[2:11:40] that
[2:11:42] PERFECT LOVE? AFTER THAT PERFECT love
[2:11:47] then comes love
[2:11:51] from
[2:11:54] love.
[2:11:56] That's the love that you have for your
[2:11:58] wife.
[2:12:01] IF SOME MAN WOULD INSULT HER.
[2:12:05] If you had a gun, YOU WOULD SHOOT HIS
[2:12:07] BRAINS OUT.
[2:12:12] HE'S VERY JEALOUS. [screaming]
[2:12:14] VERY SELFISH
[2:12:16] BECAUSE IT CREATES A JEALOUSY
[2:12:19] BUT THAT'S FA
[2:12:22] SECONDARY LOVE
[2:12:24] THEN AFTER file
[2:12:28] follow me the first one the pure one
[2:12:32] the one I've been talking about isapola
[2:12:36] then comes
[2:12:38] but then on down after that
[2:12:41] comes last
[2:12:44] but people call it love.
[2:12:47] He's married but HE'S LUSTING AFTER
[2:12:50] ANOTHER MAN
[2:12:52] AND HE says I love you. Don't they use
[2:12:55] the same words? SO IS IT LOVE? IT IS
[2:12:59] LAST [screaming]
[2:13:00] AND THEN AFTER that
[2:13:02] comes
[2:13:06] comes filth.
[2:13:09] Then you find people you know having you
[2:13:12] know you know samesex relationship
[2:13:16] you know and THEY CALL IT LOVE BUT IT'S
[2:13:20] FILTH. THEN OF COURSE PROSTITUTION AND
[2:13:23] ALL
[2:13:25] IT JUST BECOMES PERVERTED.
[2:13:28] BUT ALL OF THIS KIND OF A LOVE HAD a
[2:13:30] beginning.
[2:13:33] BUT WHEN THE REAL [screaming] GENUINE
[2:13:35] LOVE OF GOD
[2:13:38] THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COMES INTO
[2:13:41] THE HUMAN BEING
[2:13:44] BY THE NEW BIRTH
[2:13:46] BY BEING BORN AGAIN
[2:13:48] HAD NO BEGINNING AND YOU WILL HAVE NO
[2:13:51] END.
[2:13:53] YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD, MAN, and a
[2:13:56] daughter of God.
[2:13:58] And your affections are certain things
[2:14:00] ABOUT
[2:14:03] love will make you shoot a man
[2:14:07] for insulting your MARRIER
[2:14:13] WOULD MAKE YOU PRAY FOR HIS LOST SOUL.
[2:14:17] That's the difference.
[2:14:19] Amen. And that's WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR
[2:14:22] A BELIEVER TO MARRY A BELIEVER
[2:14:26] BECAUSE A BELIEVER [screaming] HAS THE
[2:14:28] LOVE OF GOD IN THEIR HEART.
[2:14:31] THAT IS
[2:14:34] BEYOND FEELINGS
[2:14:36] AND THAT CANNOT FAIL.
[2:14:39] THAT IS PERMANENT. IT HAS NO BEGINNING.
[2:14:43] IT HAS NO END. IT WILL KEEP A MARRIAGE
[2:14:46] STABLE THE WHOLE TIME.
[2:14:51] HALLELUJAH. THIS KIND OF A LOVE NEVER
[2:14:52] ENDS.
[2:14:54] IT IS PERMANENT. AMEN. SEE WHAT THE
[2:14:57] SCRIPTURE says about it in first
[2:14:59] Corinthians 13.
[2:15:02] Though I speak with tongues of men and
[2:15:03] of angels.
[2:15:05] I have not charity.
[2:15:08] What love is he talking about? He's not
[2:15:11] talking about love. uh uh he's not
[2:15:12] talking about uh you know fellow love
[2:15:17] or whatever he's talking about the love
[2:15:19] of God
[2:15:21] and he's saying even if I speak in tong
[2:15:22] with men of angels
[2:15:25] and have not charity I am become a
[2:15:28] sounding brass
[2:15:30] or a TINKLING SYMBOL AND THOUGH I HAVE
[2:15:33] GIFTS OF PROPHECY
[2:15:35] AND ALL AND UNDERSTAND ALL MYSTERIES AND
[2:15:38] ALL KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGH I HAVE ALL
[2:15:40] FAITH
[2:15:42] SO THAT I COULD REMOVE MOUNTAINS.
[2:15:45] BUT I DON'T HAVE THIS LOVE.
[2:15:48] I AM NOTHING. AND THOUGH I BESTOW ALL MY
[2:15:50] GOODS TO FEED THE POOR
[2:15:53] and though I give my body to be burned
[2:15:57] and I DON'T HAVE THIS LOVE,
[2:16:00] IT PROFITS ME NOTHING. THIS KIND OF LOVE
[2:16:04] SUFFERETH LONG.
[2:16:07] If you have that, this is what is going
[2:16:10] to happen in your marriage.
[2:16:12] It sufferth long,
[2:16:14] is kind, IT ENVIOUS NOT, FAITH NOT
[2:16:19] ITSELF,
[2:16:20] IT IS NOT PASTOR,
[2:16:23] DOES NOT BEHAVE itself unseemly,
[2:16:27] seeketh not her own,
[2:16:31] is not easily provoked,
[2:16:34] thinkketh no evil,
[2:16:36] does not rejoice in iniquity,
[2:16:40] but rejoices In the truth, IT BEARETH
[2:16:43] ALL THINGS, BELIEVETH ALL THINGS, ALL
[2:16:46] THINGS, ENDURETH ALL THINGS. THIS LOVE
[2:16:51] DOES NOT FAIL.
[2:16:53] But whether there be prophecies, it
[2:16:56] shall fail. Where there be tongues, they
[2:16:58] shall cease. Where there be knowledge,
[2:17:01] it shall vanish away. True love
[2:17:05] that does not seek her own
[2:17:08] is not selfish.
[2:17:12] So which means if you have this true
[2:17:14] love
[2:17:17] you will you will be able to give
[2:17:19] yourself
[2:17:22] in marriage for your partner for your
[2:17:25] wife.
[2:17:27] Joseph and Mariam I want you to remember
[2:17:31] you are coming together to start a home
[2:17:35] a place where you would have to learn to
[2:17:37] live for each other.
[2:17:42] for the joy, self-sacrifice,
[2:17:47] happiness of each other.
[2:17:50] You know, you you you are not little
[2:17:53] children.
[2:17:55] You've lived on this earth for some
[2:17:58] years,
[2:18:00] which means you are bent each of you in
[2:18:02] your own way.
[2:18:05] And you you are used to doing things
[2:18:07] your own way.
[2:18:10] But marriage is not a wedding.
[2:18:16] Marriage is not a wedding ceremony.
[2:18:20] You see, when you get into the real life
[2:18:23] now,
[2:18:25] you're going to realize you're with
[2:18:26] someone that has grown in some other
[2:18:28] place and you some other place.
[2:18:31] You're used to doing things differently,
[2:18:34] you know. And those of you who are
[2:18:36] married here, you know what I'm talking
[2:18:38] about, you can have differences
[2:18:42] even as something as small as how you
[2:18:45] use your toothpaste.
[2:18:49] And you find that you squeeze it
[2:18:50] differently.
[2:18:53] So and and you you just have to adapt
[2:18:56] and learn each other's ways
[2:18:59] and always be willing to give yourself
[2:19:03] for the happiness and joy of the other
[2:19:07] self-sacrifice.
[2:19:09] You want your your other partner to be
[2:19:12] happy.
[2:19:14] You know, one one time I was, you know,
[2:19:16] counseling a couple years ago
[2:19:21] and uh these were young people wanted to
[2:19:24] get married
[2:19:26] and then a a young lady,
[2:19:29] this young man wanted to marry this
[2:19:31] young lady
[2:19:33] and then you know she was interested and
[2:19:37] then later changed her mind
[2:19:40] and wanted to go with someone
[2:19:44] And then so he said, "Pastor, what can I
[2:19:46] do? I already GIVEN HER MY WHOLE HEART."
[2:19:50] I said, "Well, let's find out what the
[2:19:53] prophet of of God says about
[2:19:56] if you love her,
[2:19:59] you want her to be happy."
[2:20:02] So if she says she will be happier with
[2:20:03] another man
[2:20:07] since you want her to be happy
[2:20:10] you will tell her it's all right go with
[2:20:12] him you have my support and blessing
[2:20:16] and you not do it
[2:20:19] you do it willingly
[2:20:21] you're willing to give yourself
[2:20:23] sacrifice your desire sacrifice your
[2:20:26] feelings so that she can be happy so is
[2:20:29] it in marriage
[2:20:32] Please look at me. That's how it is
[2:20:34] going to be. Sister Mario,
[2:20:37] you have to learn to sacrifice each
[2:20:38] other's feelings and desires
[2:20:42] so the other can be happy. Give me give
[2:20:45] me five more minutes here. Ephesians 5
[2:20:49] says, "Husbands,
[2:20:50] love your wives. Even as Christ also
[2:20:53] loved the church,
[2:20:55] here is the part.
[2:20:57] And gave himself
[2:21:01] for it that he might sanctify and
[2:21:04] cleanse it with the washing of the water
[2:21:05] by the word
[2:21:08] that he might present it to himself a
[2:21:11] glorious church
[2:21:14] not having spot or wrinkle or any such
[2:21:16] thing
[2:21:17] but it should be holy and without
[2:21:19] blemish.
[2:21:22] And then he says so ought men to love
[2:21:24] their wives
[2:21:27] as their own bodies.
[2:21:29] He that loveth his wife loveth himself.
[2:21:33] For no man can yet hat or rather ever
[2:21:36] yet hated his own flesh
[2:21:40] but
[2:21:42] nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as
[2:21:46] the Lord the church.
[2:21:49] Brother Joseph be willing to nourish
[2:21:54] to cherish Mariam
[2:21:57] mind about her spiritual welfare,
[2:22:02] her physical and emotional and financial
[2:22:05] welfare.
[2:22:09] That is the way you can give yourself
[2:22:12] for her.
[2:22:15] Let Christ be your headship.
[2:22:18] Let him that is love
[2:22:22] be the driving force [screaming]
[2:22:25] to express his character
[2:22:29] through you to your wife
[2:22:32] and sister Mariam. The scripture says
[2:22:35] wives submit yourselves unto your own
[2:22:36] husband
[2:22:39] as unto the Lord.
[2:22:42] For the husband is the head of the wife.
[2:22:45] And as Christ is the head of the church,
[2:22:49] he is the savior of THE BODY. THEREFORE,
[2:22:52] the church is subject to Christ. So let
[2:22:55] the wives be to their own husbands.
[2:22:58] Sister Mariam, be willing to submit
[2:23:01] yourself to them
[2:23:03] as unto the Lord.
[2:23:05] REMEMBER, you should be willing to give
[2:23:08] and forsake all others.
[2:23:15] and give yourself only unto him.
[2:23:18] This is the type of the bride of Christ.
[2:23:22] You know, she forsook all the other
[2:23:25] lovers
[2:23:28] and only GAVE
[2:23:31] herself to him and him alone.
[2:23:35] You know, we have a bride in this last
[2:23:39] God is calling a bride out of the
[2:23:41] church.
[2:23:43] The church has gave herself to many
[2:23:46] others.
[2:23:49] The Bible talks about this woman with a
[2:23:51] cup of the wine of our fornication
[2:23:55] and has made many to drink of it.
[2:23:59] But there's a bride that has refused to
[2:24:01] drink from that.
[2:24:05] You know, you look at the screens today,
[2:24:08] you see the movie stars kissing,
[2:24:11] hugging and slopping up around all these
[2:24:14] women.
[2:24:15] A WOMAN THAT DOES THAT IS OF A BAD
[2:24:17] CHARACTER.
[2:24:20] She might be virtuous otherwise,
[2:24:23] but in her heart,
[2:24:25] when you know those sex glands meet in
[2:24:28] in the lips of a man kissing a woman and
[2:24:30] is actually potentially committed
[2:24:31] adultery,
[2:24:35] Now keep the church in mind.
[2:24:39] The denominational church
[2:24:41] is kissing and sloping and mixing around
[2:24:43] and everything
[2:24:45] in everything
[2:24:47] but the word.
[2:24:51] To believe in one God,
[2:24:56] you are giving yourself to the world.
[2:24:59] You are refusing to mix yourself
[2:25:02] with the things of the world. To be
[2:25:04] baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus
[2:25:05] Christ,
[2:25:07] you're refusing yourself to mix up with
[2:25:09] the things.
[2:25:11] You are like a bride
[2:25:14] that is submitting herself
[2:25:17] to her Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:25:21] When both of you decide to cast
[2:25:22] selfishness aside
[2:25:27] and you give yourself
[2:25:29] When you let this love govern your home,
[2:25:34] a home where you will raise children
[2:25:37] trained in the ways of the world.
[2:25:41] I want to say this as I finish.
[2:25:43] If you do that,
[2:25:46] your union
[2:25:48] will never fail.
[2:25:52] I've had many times
[2:25:54] where people say when people marry get
[2:25:58] married young
[2:26:00] those marriages will fail.
[2:26:03] I've been a part of many marriages
[2:26:06] ceremonies
[2:26:08] of young people who are giving
[2:26:10] themselves to the Lord and
