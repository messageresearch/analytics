Unbelieving becomes my [Music] victory. It's not hard to believe where things are going. There is sky for sunny. [Music] When you feel you're making progress, doing good. Living in the time of plenty. But if all of that should change, would you still keep the faith? That's the question. [Music] Don't believe when the living isn't easy. That is the testing. [Music] And I need faith for the time. When the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory. When there's no time to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the one of God alone, I must cling and I need strength for the day. When troubles come my way and I just don't understand what it means. That's when nothing else we do. Then we long we see food. I believe becomes my victory. And I need faith all the time. When the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory. When there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the one of God alone I must cling and I need strength for the day when troubles come my way and I just don't understand what it means. That's when nothing else we do. Faith alone will see me through. I believe becomes my victory. That's when nothing else will do. The world alone will see me through.

Let it be a day of reviving, restoring, blessing your people, giving them breakthroughs, granting their hearts desires, discerning the secrets of the heart. For you said in your word that the word is a discerner. Father, we may not have a gift that the prophet of the age, but you said the word is a discerner of the secrets and of the hearts. Reach out everyone. Address their need. Touch them. Lord, even as who are standing here, Lord, take us out of the way. Let it not be that man is sick but the Lord Jesus the power of the Almighty come to confirm the word. Father we can speak we can do all that but it's only you that can make this word alive.

We thank God for this morning and for this time, for this hour that he has granted us. It's always a good thing, a joyous moment when we come to the house of God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Abraham said we come to church to be better. Why we come to church is to be better. He said to become better Christians, to become better citizens, to become better neighbors, to become better. That's why we come to church. After every service as we're opening numbers 35, I read verse 26 to 28. Always ask yourself, what has been added to me? Am I becoming better or not? Have I lost something? Have I lost something which wasn't good? And I'm becoming better. If you can get something small that can draw you a step closer to Christ, it's good enough. I want to use one hour only. I was looking whether there is a watch day. Maybe we shall get one. I will use only one hour. If I go beyond I if it knocks 1 hour it's it's now 11:40 41 past midday 01 I have to be off of preaching the Bible says numbers 35:26 to 28 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whether he was fled, and the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood killed the slayer, he shall not be guilty of blood because he should have remained in the city of his refuge. I want to stop there and not continue with that verse because that's what I want. [Music] Amen. Shall we pray? Father, add a blessing to your word. Open it. Speak it out. Reveal it to your people. Open their hearts. Open their minds. Make them ready to become better Christian. In Jesus Christ name I pray. Amen. Please take your seats. Amen. Amen. God bless each one of you. Our guests, you are most welcome. This is days of the voice fellowship. Days of the voice fellowship. No law but love. No membership but no book but the Bible and the blood of Jesus Christ. Amen. Our pastor is not with us. We all know he's in Australia. He called me on Saturday and he said, "I'm praying for you. It always encourages us. He always calls us.

Amen. My subject today is stay within the borders. Stay within the borders of the city of refuge. Stay within the borders of the city of refuge. Don't go beyond the borders. Stay within there. In the Old Testament when God called the children of Israel, he said when he said after I've given you the victory and you have conquered the land, taken possession of it, you shall appoint six [Music] cities. And these cities belong to the Levites. And these six cities were to be taken. A city, the rest of the tribes had to surrender a portion of their inheritance and to the Levites and to the Levites no inheritance because the Levites had to receive an inheritance from the inheritance of their president. Then he says then you appoint six cities and these six cities this is Jordan before crossing Jordan appointed three cities and after Jordan appointed three cities that had a And then he said that he that kills a [Music] man and aware by mistake. He should flee to one of the cities that he may not be slain by the avenger of blood. Take note the avenger of [Music] blood. If he avenged, he was not guilty. Amen. Because it was an iPhone. So there was an avenge of blood. You slay a man, the avenge of blood comes to you also and he is not guilty. Therefore, God says, "There are people that do these things, kill one another unaware. Such a one is innocent. He needs to be forgiven, but there was no forgiveness. Then God said such a one. It is a blessing where they can flee and the avenge of blood I have no permission to go in there and kill them. Amen. Then he says only those that do it by mist they did it but they didn't mean to do it. They don't want to do it. It's not in their hearts to do it. They didn't plan to do it. They had to do it. It's not a part of them. They don't want it. But they did it. It says for make them a city of rest six of them. But if any man premeditates, plans I hate him. I don't know I can poison him. Kill him. And you plan this how I will do it. Get him a Jewish brother minister take this. Oh God bless you. And he takes it and he dies and you have committed murder. God says, "Such one shall not be allowed to go into the seat of God. He should surely be killed by the avenge of blood in Numbers 35 and in Joshua 20, Joshua did it and he put those cities. A man that runs to that city was supposed to stay within the borders that city until the high priest of that time ties then you are free can go. And also this man had to stand before the congregation for judgment but is innocent is is okay in the seat of ref. But if this man dares to get out and goes beyond the borders of that city and the high priest is not yet dead of that time, that man and the avenger of blood comes and he finds him beyond the borders of God. He he will surely seal him and he is not guilty because he went out of the seat of refuge. But if he goes in the seat of refuge to to to avenge kill the other one, it it's not granted. We are together stay within the borders. There are so many things and people today count for a place of refuge. Some it's their money, others it's music. To some it's their phones. As long as I have a smartphone and it has data. Well, I feel safe. I feel good to others. It's their as long as I'm a Catholic. As long as I'm a Muslim, as long as I'm a Jehovah witness, as long as I'm I go to a message church, as long as I'm this or that, I know I am safe. You are not safe, to some it's their fellow church members, to some it's the pastor, but they count him for a refuge. To some it's television. They feel safe with it. They just can't do without it. And programs they feel comforted. Tik Tok. They feel comforted. When they laugh, they feel they're happy. But it is just a noise. It's just a noise. Not happiness to others. It's social media. Social media. They feel they can run into it on their status and express their feelings. Social media cannot be touched the feeling of there was a sister in courtship with the brother when the brother cheated. She she said he cheated. His strength went away and he posted it on her status crying. The sister went strong. He cheated. Then all of us who commented, "Sorry, sorry. God bless you. God will comfort you." She posted to feel comforted. But that can't comfort. That can't be a refuge. No brother. It cannot be that the people count certain things for a place of refuge which don't work. They run church to church place to place seeking [Music] rest about running different cities. If I run to campa pressure rises, pressure increases. They run from go to pressure. They run from go back to the village. Pressurize. There is no refuge on to others. It's their position. Possession. Like the rich man that had a lot, he had plenty of harvest and he said, "Rest my soul. You have bread. Rest my soul. You have bread." But when God come down, he said, "Thou poor." And when the pharaoh died, he didn't get rest. He perished in hell. He wept. The possession couldn't give him refuge. Brother, sister, others, they count their husbands or their wives for a blessed breakfast. One will say, I will just run over to my husband and all all will be well. I will just run over to my wife. I'll just feel safe as safe can be. And another said the children, they will say, "My mommy, my daddy. I can just run to them any time. I'm just safe." But we find out in the old testament in the days of Moses when they were in Egypt and the death angel was passing in the land of Egypt to sele at the festival. Maybe these children would say, "Oh, mama, look. There is Oh, papa. There is there is a darkness. There it is." And mama, papa, I'm not seeing it, sir. I'm not seeing it, sir. There it is. There it is. Amen. Hallelujah. They couldn't help it was the same days of L in the days of Lord. The people cried ran to different places. Maybe they climbed trees. Maybe they had built caves. Maybe they had got mushrooms. Maybe they had got a lot of things. But when the flood came the place of refuge was the knew what met always one place of refuge but maybe they try maybe they had a titanic of their day but it couldn't work because A refuge must be ordained of God. Hallelujah. You cannot ordain a refuge as a man. This is where I run to when the trouble comes. This is where I will run to. It will pick you up. It will go there. Trouble will go there. It will pick you out. and destroy you. Brother, in the days of Lot, some had strong houses. The kings in their palaces, but the fire that came could not see the strength of those marches. Oh brother, the roof which was run, flee to the mountain. It was an emergency and in the times of emergency, God provides a those to those that are innocent. Hallelujah. Man has always run somewhere, somewhere where they can find refuge. These cities of refugee, they were for all the strangers, the sjaners, children of Israel, all of these ones, six of them, three decided typing, you know, across Jordan is the baptism of the Holy Ghost. Before Jordan, You are still you are still there in sanctification church. But even there God says these people that have not yet received the Holy Spirit and they have accepted the Lord. If they do anything wrong, they can come to the city of refuge. Even these ones that have the Holy Ghost shall do mistakes. But they can have refuge. Never ever think because the brother, a sister's done a mission, does not have the Holy Ghost. That's wrong. That's not right. That was the type. And you notice that when God always provides and makes a way of escape for all men, but men reject it. They refuse to enter in. Some stop at the door. Some just talk about it. Can you imagine? Some look at it. And say, "Well, it's pretty good. It's a fine good sermon." They won't get in. Some say it's the devil and they burst him and perish. Some point others to it and themselves never go in. Some stop others from getting it. Like the Pharisees in those days, the innocent one, someone that has done harm, but they didn't mean to do harm. They had to flee to the place of refuge. I want you to notice a man had to flee, not to walk, push themselves [Applause] around, should I go? And then they go, should I return? He had to flee. [Music] Hallelujah. Not to be as if going as if not but disappear quickly in haste. You flee for your life because the avenger. If he finds you, he will slay you. Flee. You run as fast as you don't look back. You just run for Hallelujah. Or else you are guilty. You the avenger will slay you. There was a man sent from God. He was Reverend William Maron. Reverend William. He was a prophet of the entire end time age, the last church age. He preached a message letting off the pressure in 1962. And he said, "Now in the Old Testament, God is saying in some of this trouble was accidentally done." So if you are innocent and not guilty, God makes a way for you. Now if a man killed a man just deliberately premeditated, he was lost. He could not come to this place. But if he did, he didn't mean to do it. Then there was a city. Amen. He says now the people could come to this city if accidentally he done something wrong. He didn't mean to he would come to the situation and go to the gate. The gatekeeper would ask him why he was coming. The gatekeeper would ask him, "Why have you come?" What was his idea of coming? Then his case was pleaded. And when his case was pleaded at the gate and the man be formed found innocent, he did it not willfully. Then the man was taken into the city as a place of refuge. Then the enemy could not get him. And if he lied and done wrong and he come into the city of though he was holding on the horns of the altar, his enemy had the privilege and the right to drag him on that altar. kill him. That's what happens in the church. Come to God sincerely. Yes, sir. Because he was guilty, premeditated and he had to be punished. You see the avenger is a punisher. He puts the pain upon the wrongdoer. There was something went with dad because that man would be nervous. He would be nervous. My he says maybe a dozen of men behind it somewhere every rock every hill every bush the enemy was there the avenger was there because straight is the gate and narrow is the way somebody was standing ready for him. He was nervous. And then when he once got into the city, he would let off the pressure. He was safe. He was all right because there was a provided place made for him. Oh brother, sister, maybe you look on the side. Land road is knocking and you turn this side the electricity is over. When you look this side when you look the other side the wife is sick. As you're there, the Lord's office, as you're there, the children are hungry. Rest rises up. You can run somewhere. You can run somewhere. Don't let the pressure rise. Run into the borders. He says, "There was a provided place for him. God has provided way that innocent man not to be slain. Amen. But he could be exempted from slaying because he did it accidentally if he didn't mean to do it. But if he meant to do it, he had to stand the circumstance. Brother, sister, sin, believer or not believer will never go unpunished. That's hard to swallow, but you have to swallow it. Believe or not, believe sin has to be punished, there is no chance for him if he did it willfully. Brother, sister, in those days, God gave them six cities. But when you see there are 60 there's one missing to complete the number. They have got to be seven. They have to be seven cities. But the seventh is always a mystery. [Music] The seventh is a man. Hallelujah. I'm saying the servant is a man. God the servant. The Bible says Psalms 9:9-10, the Lord also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble. The 70 city of refuge is the Lord himself where people can flee where people can run too and find rest. You are getting it here. It says, "Whosoever will he that is heavy laddened and weak, come and have rest." If you are tired of sin, you have walked in impunity. You have you are worn out. You are tired of sickness. You are tired of jealous. You are tired of anger. You are tired of lust. You are tired of bitterness. You are tired of rumors and it is eating you up and it eats like a c. But if you don't want it, there is a refuge where you can be set free if you want it. If you want it, that is sin that grips your soul and it doesn't grieve you, you will perish with it. But if you don't want it out, I don't want this weakness. It has beaten me down. You know, I don't want it. Come for rest. Christianity, he says, I will give you rest because my yoke is light. My burden is light. Learn of me. I am meek and lowly in [Music] me. Seline and holy, obedient to lord. I long to be like him. It says you shall find rest unto your soul. Christianity is about rest. Hallelujah. [Music] Rest. If you are in Christ, it's about rest. Let off the pressure. Stay within the borders. All is well. All is well. All is well. All is well. Stay within the borders. She said, "It is well. It is well. It is well. It is well. It is well. It is [Music] well." Some say What if someone would say in those days, well, the city is too far, I will just run over here to my neighbor that can hide it there. I will run over here to my friends and hide it there. It's so hard to get the Holy Ghost. It's not hard. Is it receive the Holy Ghost? They that hunger and thirsty after righteousness, they shall be filled. Oh God, how can I overcome? Faith is the victory and overcomes the world. Oh Lord, how can I defeat this? I'm so heavily burdened with the Lord of so defeated. I need a breakthrough. Lord, it is easy. Stay within the border. Hallelujah. I am weak. Perhaps they would say I will run over to my friend and hide there because I am weak because I'm tired. I can't pray. I can do this. I can do that. You will perish. This pharaoh had no choice. The man has no choice. Sin has no choice. You have no choice. You have no choice but to run. What can I do? Lord, you have no choice to run. I am tired. I just can't go through all that running in Christianity. Full of desperation. It's full of it's hard. Yeah, it's hard. But you are not alone. God bless you, brother Martin. You are not alone. He helps you to run in the race. I just can't make it. Let me go over here. To my in-laws, to my relative, let me do this or that. When the avenger comes, we shall talk it over. I've heard he can be merciful. He will understand. He will not understand. Poor little soul, brother, sister. He will not understand. The Lord understands. He understands now later. He won't [Music] understand. He won't understand your cry. Seek the Lord. But he can still be run. When there is still time to repent, when there is still mercy, when the rapture is gone, there's no baptism of the Holy Ghost. The rapture goes with the Holy Ghost. The rapture goes with the blood. Stay within the border. run to the borders. Look brother, this fellow he had no say whatsoever. He is a subject after he has entered this city. He has no say. He is a subject under the government of that city, under the laws of that city, he is under the control of that city. Whatever the city offers, he must be satisful because he has only fled for refuge. You can't flee to my home or refuge and you start giving order remove that chair. Put it there. I will take it there turn it like this. I'll turn it and it will look that side when you come back. I'm not happy with this. If you don't hear me say pastor, this brother has a problem. What am I saying? You don't flee for refuge to put orders. You must abide by the Lord. Amen. Now, now someone will say, "When you get married, won't you stay in pastor's office all the time?" Because if you tell the wife like that, you're saying, "Brother Julius, if you get a wife and you treat her like that, won't you always be in pastor's office? If she says turn the bed like this and you turn it there and then you say what is wrong with you? Not the wife. Not the wife. I'm saying a stranger that has spread to the world is under a curse. So you have to stay within the borders of the message because the message is the cast. Hallelujah. Stay within the borders the world has been cast and in the message the message stays the stay within the borders of the word. Stay within the borders of the cross and it shall be well. Just stay within the border. Amen. Just within there. It is well. Imagine this fellow could run. But then he looks back. He had no rest until he said. Hallelujah. There is two classes of people today. May I say this? There's men and women in the world today. Then he says that really don't want to do these things they are doing in the church here. They don't want to do the things they want. There is men and women in the world today that don't want to sin. I feel sorry for them. They don't want to do anything wrong, but they do [Music] it. They are drove to it. Something drives them. After doing it, they cried. I remember when I was a Pentecost, I tried to overcome the world, I tried and I tried, I fasted and I prayed, but the next day I go back into the same thing. I wake up at night. I cried. Lord forgive me. Lord help me. What can I do? I failed. But when I came to the message just to come to the message rather I don't know I overcame and I overcame. Hallelujah. Yes sir. There is the power in the message. He says there is a place for that person that wants to do right. There is a place let off that person. It's true. But there is some that don't care. They come to the church. Listen. Every time you come to church, you either go back better or worse whether I like it or not. Big-headed, highminded, stubborn. I don't care. Brother, this is not a home where we have to say Jesus is not for stubborn people. The gospel is not your mother's teaching. It's not your mother's stick. Like what? What? The gospel ought to change you. Hallelujah. What is something said and do [Music] right nature nature pull them pull them pull them that stubbornness cannot take you anywhere brother sister you ought to come to without no one pushing you. Do what is right. Think right. Be right. Do right. Become right. Respect God. God is not respect person. How will God be respected? God is not respect person. Ah, God has tough today. I I'm I'm trying to cast that demon out. He will never bow to any man. He cannot put difference. You just they just don't care. He says, "You see, some people don't care. They don't want at all. It does nothing to them. You preach it does nothing to them. Pastor talks to them, it does [Music] nothing. He talks this and it does that. tap on anyhow just carry on brother sister they just love to walk in sing just like a pig loves to play in the m eating vomit such a fellow has no blessing has no part Christ says the prophet. Hallelujah. Beat preacher, beat song leader, beat musician, beat teacher, beat prophet, pastor, evangelist with that kind, husband or wife, you have no part in Christ. He come for the weary. Those that are tired to walk [Music] in. If you love it, listen, just carry on. But the end there is dead. If you want to do right, I'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a city A city of love, a city of mercy that is Jesus Christ. If you don't want to do wrong and the enemy is after you say, "Brother Julius, understand me, I don't want it. It is you that I want. There is a way of escape. That escape is Jesus. There is a place where you can come and let off the steam. Hallelujah. But if you love to sin and you don't want God, then the enemy is going to overtake you somewhere. Listen, you can't come to Christ. You can't come to Christ because you don't want [Music] to see. You love sin, so you can't come to Christ. For it is written, John 3:19, this is the condemnation that light is coming to the world. And men loved darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil. For everyone that does evil hates the light, neither comes to the light. Lest is it did should be reproved. Reprove them. Reprove them. Try to reprove them. See how they respond. You will know. But he that does truth comes to the light that his deeds may be manifest. that they are wrought in God. Amen. When this man comes to Christ, a place of refuge, when a a man come in the Old Testament, the first thing he had he had to come upon his own free will. And that's the way you have to come to Christ. Now you say, "Brother Julius, I came many years ago." [Music] All right. Another thing you must be satisfied. while you are there. You can't hang around every day crying. I would like to get out of here. I like to get out of here. They would put you out. You must willfully want to stay. comes don't go please wait may not do that not all of us have patience like I may tell one time or two time says if you try to reprove somebody twice and they refuse. That one is an heretic. Leave them alone and I'm not guilty. Come to church. Where are you today? Leave that [Music] girl. Don't get married. I'm begging. Why making the pastor kneel? Brother, you must want to stay. It must be that you must want to stay in that city. Show love so that you love Christ that you don't want to leave him. Show that where you enter the best. Show that what you have. It is a power of great price. Show love. Express your love to the city you entered in. Brother, sometimes I'm beaten here and there. Yeah, I am talking about you. You are the one I'm talking about. I love these things. I love these things. But now when you leave here today, we have completed you. We have finished it. Don't start telling us. We have given you the t. Don't take it. It is up to you. And this preacher is not caring. The preacher is caring. That is why he has brought the message. God cares. The message is a refuge. When you come to Christ, you can't look back to the world. The Bible says, "He that puts a hand to the plow and turns to look back is not worthy of the plowing. Luke 962 there is where so many soal Christians make their mistake. They act like they are going to blow but the first little thing comes along they blow [Music] up about it. Walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. Just walk with God. He says you must count the cost first. You have start the race. Are you ready to start on until when you enter the city of refuge? And are you ready if you reach the city to stay there? Cuz if you enter this city, you must know that you are covered. You are protected. You have boundaries. You shouldn't go beyond now. Don't tell us. You know me. I'm waiting. The brothers in the church are not doing anything. I'm old. We shall not listen to that. You are not old. You are still a younger girl. And you look beautiful now. Don't be on pressure. Rest now. That is why I met Tony. You know this Tony will change. Why Tony won't change? Tony wants you after getting you. He will regret. Amen. Brother say youth like me I don't refuse. I am not refusing. But it is not [Music] right. I'm only human. I'm just a man. I also believe it. But what you want to do, you're going to go beyond the boundary. This avenger will attract you. The avenger of blood will destroy you. That's why I've brought a and says if you cross here and you leave Christ and you go in the world you want to test you may not return it is not the world alone don't yield to a wrong spirit You must count the cost first. You act like as if you are going to testify, as if you are going to give, as if you're going to help, as if you're going to pray, as if you're going to fast. You act like as if something you are going to do something. Then you start something comes up and you blow up and you begin like a chicken. You shout, "You must count the cost first. I'm just getting done here just in my time there." He says, "The man must want to stay. in the refuge. Now listen, he can't go in there complaining. These things of the messaging they are no things. We are not free. You are the one who is not. You are the one who is not free. Hallelujah. be free for us. We are free and free indeed. Hallelujah. Brother, brother, how do you do it? It's the grace of God. But you have failed to love it. He says, he says just fall in love with God. He must want to stay. He says no complainings about it even outside he dies inside he is safe and that is it today. If your aim is to complain about the word of God, complain about the Bible, complain about the message, complain about this. I am afraid, you may blow [Music] up. The pressure will pump up and then you will blow up. and begin going astray, going mad. Hey, you get the hand and you throw it up in the air in the sky. Probably you in the release it and release it in the space. It has wings. It has feathers. It can even fly. where you have thrown it up, it will complain and then it will blow up because it is not an eagle and the territory where you have put it. It is a territory for eagles. Therefore the hand will complain. Take me back. You cannot manage evil things. If somebody will perish, even if you drag them to church and employ them to lure them and you visit them and give them gifts, if they will never get saved, you will bring them to church and they will complain because he is not that. You are the one tying yourself to them. Many people they in the message they in the church but we are just tying them in brother. Forgive me for saying that. But the truth is you will forgive me for saying this because after all you will go back if this person is guilty and you bring them in the state of refuge because he's guilty at the end of it all will cross the boundary and look for girls and take them to their home. But he's there. He's a preacher. He's preter a musician. And then after this another person, he was just dragged. It is like forcing somebody into marriage, even though they are a Christian, even if it is me, we may not separate, but I may I may leave you alone. I said, "Let me go. Let me go and look for another place, but I will never marry again. I would rather go and be somewhere alone than staying with this woman because you don't love them. They just dragged you into her. I want to say something the people here if you are not a Christian I came to this city of Russia. He says about 30 years ago. I've never wanted to go out. I came into Christ. Everything that I longed for was in here. Hallelujah. I don't want to go [Music] out. I pray daily. Oh God, I'm so happy here. Just let me stay. I never want to leave. And I know he will never leave me. I know he will never leave you. He will never leave you. And the pressure gets great. If it does, then he is our outlet. So we don't have to worry about it. Hallelujah. If you are all pressured up and you don't know where you are going, you don't know what's going to happen to you after death and you know you are going to die. You have got to do too. You have got to die. And the thing to come is come to Christ the refuge and let off the [Music] pressure. Brother and brother I need something. It says we can let off the pressure, settle it once for all. No matter what takes place, listen. No matter what takes place, Christ is our refuge. Amen. And when we come to him, we can let off the pressure. You can quit worrying about it. [Music] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir. He says, "Well, if I die, you say, well, if I die, what's going to happen to me? What's going to happen to my wife? What's going to happen to the husband? What's going to happen to the children?" Just come to Christ and let off the pressure. Oh, he gives us all things. Hallelujah. Amen. Glory. Christianity. The message it was given. Shalom. He preached the message shalom. It is rest. He says he gives us all things to one. He gives us all things. All things are ours by Christ. So just let the pressure off. That's the only one way you can do it. Bring it to Christ. I assure you, by the time you rise up, you will be in the rest. Amen. Hallelujah. I don't care what it is. that has brought pressure in your life. Stay in Christ. You might join a church. It will still build up pressure because the Methodist church will tell you that they are right. The Baptist is wrong. The Baptist will say they are wrong, we are right. It just builds up pressure because you don't know where you are standing or you say I will join a message church. Maybe you have a gift. Maybe you know too much about the message. That's good to keep it up. But that's not what we are talking about. that will still build up pressure and you will blow up. Enter in Christ by the Holy Ghost. And if you ever come to Christ, just let off the pressure. It's all over. Settle it down. It's God's provided place of service. The name of the Lord is a mighty tower. The righteous run and is safe in time of sickness. When sickness strikes, the doctor says nothing else can be done. Don't build up pressure. Let off the pressure. Call your pastor. Let him anoint you with oil. Pray over you. The prayer of faith shall save the sick. That is what lets off the pressure. While you are in the refuge, you've got a right to anything that's in the refuge. And Christ is our refuge. Everything you have need of is in him. You say I wonder brother. He says you don't have to wonder. Just let off the pressure. Commit your guest to God on as if it was all over. [Music] Don't build up pressure. Let off the pressure. Cast your cares on him for he cares for you. Shall we stand on our feet? There was a sister. Abraham talked about meating off the pressure. This sister, she looked young about 30 years. But this sister was 60 years. He said, "How do you sister?" You look 30. She said, "I have sons which are of your age." He said, "How do you do sister? say, "Brother, when I came to Christ, I asked myself if something is too big for me and it is too big for God, why do I have to worry about it? If it's already too big for me, I just give it to him. if it is too big for him. I don't know. So I just quit worrying and I cast all my cares upon [Music] you. But we have brother [Applause] [Music] sister. You have got old because you are young but you are getting wrinkles. You're a younger man. You want us to beat you? No. You are worrying for no good. Let off the pressure. Let off the pressure. Let off the pressure. Because you are in Christ. It is rest. Just stay within the boundaries. Amen. I have fin my soul in Christ alone knowing him in quietness. Hallelujah. When the o rise and th I will sow with you above the stor. Father, you are king. [Music] Oh, I will be still. I know [Music] you still when the [Music] ocean does I will s you above the stor you are king Oh [Music] man, I will be still you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] God. Heat.

Take over Jesus. Let our lives be set free [Music] of all the trouble you [Music] [Music] Just lay down your burden to him. Casting it all to Christ. Tell him, "Lord, I don't want to go. Lord, I don't want to go out of Christ." The enemy is dragging you, but the devil is pulling you out. The sin that is besetting you something that is taking me say Lord touch me cleanse me Lord take it away let me stay in Christ Lord Jesus Christ you hear your people Lord as they are crying to you father as they are calling upon your name as they are desiring to stay they want to be free Lord They want you, Father.

Before we close with a word of prayer, request brother Marvin, you project that song. Jesus is a refuge of our [Music] soul. You said Jesus is lover of our soul. Shall sing then give closing prayer. As you're meditating upon what we've heard this day, I believe the Lord has spoken to us. He has spoken to me. And just as the minister was saying that either you become better or you go in your works, but I trust each one of us. It's our desire always to see God speaking to us. Because the Bible say that those whom he love he correct, he rebuke and he chasten. So when the Lord comes and rebukes you is in fact you're on the better side because God is always and only concern about his children. God will never rebuke the neighbor's child. That is none of his business. And I believe that all of us are children of God. And personally always when the word comes and the Lord does not speak to me I go back say God indeed I'm bad off but when he comes and correct you brother what you have to do you say that this day when you hear my voice hard not your heart like our fathers did in the wilderness. So brethren, I believe that was the masterpiece. It was evangelctic sermon, but the Lord has spoken to us and we appreciate the Lord for that. Shalom. Yes sir. Jesus love. Oh my soul, lead me to thy borderless [Music] in his [Music] heart. Behold my sior high till the storm of life. Save to the heaven. Lord receive my soul. Brother, we have no other refuge. My helpless soul [Music] me and comfort me. All my trust on me each day. All my help from thee I [Music] bring the sh [Music] Thou, oh Christ, are all I want, all I want. Praise the fall and share the fame. He [Music] seek just thy name. I am L. Ious and full of sing of truth and grace. Jesus [Music] love my soul. Tell me to thy [Music] balance wrong by the tempest. [Music] Guide me home my savior till the storm of life is [Music] burning the heart or receive my soul. Oh, [Music] oh rock of ages for us. Lord, let us hide ourselves in thee. Lay thy water and thy blood from thy wounded side. Precious Jesus, we come before the throne of grace tonight. We thank you for the word that has gone forth, Lord. Lord, we are weighed on high and we are found Lord wanting but Lord Jesus. We have nowhere to run. You're the only hope that we have Lord. You're the hope of the hopeless. Lord the father of the fatherless. You say that you are the husband of the widows. You are our redeemer. Lord Jesus remember even one time when we are going the downward way. Thy grace found us. It's you who found us Lord Jesus. We thank you for the words of rebuke and correction. Lord, it's because you saw us straying, Lord. But Father, this day you have sent your word and you say that when you send your word, it will never go back to fighting, but thy word will accomplish its purpose. And you gave us a good example, Lord, just the way when you send the rain on the surface of the earth, that do not go back the same. It waters the earth for the soul to have a seed. Even this day, may the great Holy Spirit water this word in our soul. May you make us a better Christian. Prepare us first when coming Lord Jesus. You have showed us there's no way Lord we can play around and make it Lord. But this day Lord we are making a resolution Jesus. And Lord, we are deciding Lord. We having a purpose like Daniel of old who father who perhaps father perassed in his heart Lord Jesus not to defile himself with a king's meat where we have fallen short of your glory. We ask you to forgive us. We accept our faults that Lord we are wrong. Forgive our errors of omission and of commission. Forgive our iniquity and our sin. Forgive our father our backsliding this day. You said in Jeremiah that return all backsliding children for I'm married unto you. Lord Jesus, make us a better Christian. Revive us, Lord. Revive our moral values. Renew our strength. Father, you say it in your word that let those who lip lips no more Lord, but let them get healed. Father, Lord Jesus, may you heal each and every soul tonight. We thank you for the vessel you have used. We ask you that Lord revive his strength. May you continue using him in a mighty way, Lord. Father, may your anointing be great upon his life. Precious father, remember our pastor. We pray for him. Thank you that Lord you're using him even for all the service ahead of him. We pray that you continue using him. We pray for his family. Oh God, may you abide with him even as we leaving this place going back to our homes. We pray that we go with each one of us Lord.

You enlighten their territories, loving master, that our children will have what is enough for father take them to school and keep them until they come back. Precious father, you promise us and we are depending on that that thou shall supply our needs according to riches in glory. We know that glory is packed and Jesus we claim those riches for our children in the name of Jesus Christ. For the Bible say that our children are your heritage Lord. Father you promise that you will provide loving master. provide for each one of us. For every parent, Lord, every single Lord, each and everybody, Lord Jesus, according to your word, because we are living in the time where the Bible says that the child shall live by faith. Our faith is in thee, Lord. If you don't provide for us, Lord, we are gone. If you don't help us, Lord, we are finished, Lord. But you promise us that Lord, you will never leave us alone. You will come and be with us even in us Lord Jesus unto the ends of the world. Father we bless your lovely name. We give you praise. I commit father ministers at your hands.
