to us here is something good so when jesus had risen from the dead yes on the first day of the week the disciples were gathered in one place the people the the the the believers were fearing the jews the other people that would come in trouble again but jesus stood in the midst of them hallelujah hallelujah jesus does not need the doors the physical doors to be opened for him to come good two cannot move together seven or two it can reach the lowest health whosoever two come again he was saying that he can reach to the heavens you see the love of god is unquenchable god so we see here he was the disciples were closed in a room i believe it might have been as small as probably this room is music you know 12 men were let me tell you and walk because you have not yet where by people have bibles on their ipads on their phones they feel that they can go to that to the church with that attorney and you will walk with it on the road you will even go to eat with it to work if you are seated in an office you will put your bible by your side bible because you are not ashamed of jesus christ and so you are not ashamed of this gospel questions amen i mean let me tell you at the moment young men will be filled with the holy ghost you will the revelation when jesus was with them for three and a half years yes he was revealing himself to them why because he was the one [Music] he was revealing himself to the disciples the revelation of the world brings christ when christ comes christian what does he do he fills you with himself i'll quit i'll put you down hallelujah i mean when jesus christ rose again from the dead yesterday he didn't tell them i'll go and preach the gospel you are ready for because you are the revelation of the world amen hallelujah amen he breathed on them and he said unto them never come back receive you the holy ghost i'd like you to turn to the book of revelation chapter 10. we can begin from revelation chapter five and i saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with seven seals and i saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and these seals thereof no man in in earth heaven under the earth was able to open the book neither to look their own guru now or and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the lion of the tribe of judah has prevailed the root of david has prevailed to open the book and lose the seven seals thereof turn of the and of the forbids and in the midst of the elders stood as alarm as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look their own today and i beheld a law in the midst of the throne and of the phobias and in the midst of the um the elder student alarm as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of god sent forth into all the earth [Music] means jesus christ is christian do you believe that is the lamb is jesus christ and when was he slain for our sins he was slain for our sins before the foundation of the world meaning uh the penalty for sin was paid before even the foundation of the world why because god had his children jesus was not just a body or just a son of god yes the bible says god was in christ reconciling the world to himself and this is the lamb we see in the hallelujah he had a plan to hallelujah and when his father wanted to bless them you know his heart's crossed and while jacob was there yeah joseph was confused what are you doing and as it were it was trying to show the miracle of the cross this old man did not do it in his own accord it was by nature is the gentiles were able to be [Music] i don't want to offend [Music] and we see in the book of revelation praise and we know that it's jesus christ and in revelation 10. and i saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven close with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the sun under his feet as the pillars of fire okay so [Music] okay and he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot on the earth and he cried with a lot of voices and i had a voice from heaven saying unto me away hallelujah but verse 7 says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angels praise the name of the lord when jesus christ yes christ who is the lamb the day he died on the cross he paid the price yeah [Music] and he finished it now we are children of adam faith to rebound about them because of the way we were born and we were yes he said it is finished you can't but you were dead why right was finished the work of the temple hallelujah was supposed to be redeemed by them the devil should not overcome us santorina [Music] praise the name of the lord if the true church will know who she is the devil will not overcome it i want you to think about that for a moment think about that for a moment if you know who you are oh i'm not redeemed just i'm redeemed all the way back before the fall oh is way christian is all about claiming our rights when jesus christ died yesterday i want to announce to you that you paid the price and there are for now we are redeemed [Music] and jesus yes you when he rose from the dead what was the first words he came to them i said peace [Applause] he was announcing to them is there a time for them to arise and shine that which you redeemed to go free children and when does that happen but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when it shall begin to sound full finishes that way do you believe that he says you will finish the mission not open the book secretly [Music] that which when he meets another one shalom other words good go with you good morning how do you do it it's a breaking day look at the canister it's darkness upon the people but it's good morning to the church is appearing [Music] we have reached a season of rejoicing [Music] hallelujah if it is revealed to you it isn't new to you hallelujah amen and when jesus christ state that yes in a few days sometimes you say something you feel like you want to go back to it and get into its depth the words we have already had at full obedience with the full word of god and titles asked for the token [Music] that you're not and they waited everybody in the leader faithfully no way him you remember the question i read for you last time before i went someone asked a brother he said how do i receive the holy spirit in the name of jesus christ it was a promise it was a promise that was to them and for their children and to them that we are far away as men as [Music] these people we are asking of how to receive the holy spirit they had already been convinced it was an experience that they wanted faith plays a huge part because when you come to god you must believe that he is oh cook oh you know not that he was oh he might be someday you must believe you cannot receive anything from god except it is by faith hallelujah amen how many believe that you are saved you are saved how many believe that jesus said as if it's the same question but it's a difference do you believe that jesus can save for cooking [Music] it's not the same as you believing that he is your savior but it is believing that he is your savior and that he will save you don't just believe god fills people with the holy ghost you know you can talk about others but you should believe or you know that jesus can fill you with the holy spirit bring it personal to you and you must believe it is god calling you i don't take it for you that he will reward you all that they will give you hallelujah if you intelligently seek him he will reward those who intelligently sick he will give you the holy ghost for he said blessed are they that hang and thus for righteousness for they shall be filled [Music] [Applause] i think those are that that would be the greatest prayer yeah can god fill the children with the holocaust can if you then look 11-3 it says if you then who know how to give gold gifts your children how much more will your heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask [Music] [Music] god cannot feel a vessel still filled with sin catholic [Music] he will not dwell in you when you are still filled with your habits are you hearing me he will not dwell in you when you are still filled with your habits go check your name habits are evil spirits they're demons museum evil spirits museum emir maybe so they must be laid on the altar and you must die out to your sins and they see nature they must die on the out of south sacrifices is important that you not only repent but you accept god's pattern of your sins you must realize that no sin is too great that god's blood will not cleanse hallelujah how can i receive the holy ghost i'm telling and be get a sign oh god if you're forgiving me do this you don't need to put god to a test attitude stands in your way of receiving the holy ghost i want you to know that the moment you come to the lord it can never be to accept what he has done for you okay that no sin is too great if any children know that god's blood will not clean him up you don't you don't understand this i don't know how much of that roman idiot i don't know how much sin i've tell what [Applause] is would go come to him you accept his forgiveness with a true revelation of god his willingness now listen listen some people don't know that they have the holy ghost because they are thought wrong they don't have the holy ghost because they're told that [Applause] [Music] you think because you did it you are part of it and it is a part of you oh there was a comment and you could even stay in church but when you have never forgiven yourself name that away even when you go to prayer never get no server instead of praying people think you're praying but you're really talking to yourself you even think that god can hear my prayers hallelujah amen so i'm here today to preach to you you are not enough in that journey and to tell you you don't need to preach yourself no more don't tell me if you have repented of something into your name of jesus [Music] christ set you on a new course hallelujah he will not withhold the holy spirit from you do it and say what you could be hallelujah yielding to the spirit is now so important surrendering all that you are to god and then accept no why you have your nabi all ye ricardo no kid is that the gift of the holy spirit around all the thirsty soils where the seed is in singapore the seed is in you insecure when it comes down to what you see the bible calls the holy spirit reigns when he comes down hallelujah i mean he fills you with yourself yeah now that is an experience it's not a doctrine it's an experience now people will ask you have antoine is a composer how do you know oh man you have the holy spirit and i've seen many people be [Music] you see my boy here oh yeah there's the mula he's the fruit if you have the holy ghost you must have the fruit of the holy ghost hallelujah [Applause] at 11 [Music] exactly 11 [Applause] it is not and you
