Uh brother um Joel as well. for the job to see you after a very long time because they've been with school and all that. &gt;&gt; We happy to see them. &gt;&gt; Brother, you brother Calb is okay. Who is working on the sound today? Can I can you give me a little more sound please? We we are reading from uh Genesis chapter 39. And um today we are also recording for evening light bright tabernacle even on the zoom. The believers are streaming on zoom there. So uh it's not only here tonight. So we send our regards and greetings to the saints on Zoom. The precious name of our Lord Jesus. So this is going to be part two of what we shared at the church here on on Sunday, son of prosperity. Uh we take um Genesis 39. We begin from verses one. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. Because of time I will not interpret the reading but you can just read in your Bible if you are reading the Luganda Bible. And Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Portifer an officer of Pharaoh captain of the God an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishalites which had brought him down thther. And the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man. And he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. And his master saw that the Lord was with him, and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him, and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put into his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. And I just love that verse. All that he had. The Lord blessed all that he had in in the house and in the field. Amen. And he left all that all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he knew not all he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person and wellfavored. And it came to pass after these things that his master's wife um uh cast her eyes upon Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me." me. But he refused and said unto his master's wife, "Behold, my master walteth not what he is with me in the house." And he has commanded all that he has to my hand. There is none greater in this house than I, neither has he kept back anything from me but thee, because thou art his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?" And it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or to be with her. And it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do business. And there was none of the men of the house there within. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And and and she caught and she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." and he left his garment in our hand and fled and got out. Amen. And that's why we as believers whenever wherever we are, we don't we try to keep the order. You know, you don't want to be found in a house alone with you know somebody that is not your sister, your mother and and and then you say, "Well, for me, I'm okay with it." And you find that in the world they even host them in their houses. You find I a young man hosting a sister in the house. We do not believe in that kind of thing. You see, uh, it spoils the testimony and and Joseph just went in the house to see what he would, you know, to try and do some work there. And there was nobody else. And that's the opportunity that this woman got to be able to try and defile his testimony. But we thank God that if you are a true child of God and you are sincere in your heart, no one can defile your testimony. And I will continue here. And it came to pass when he when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and was fled forth, that she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto them, saying, See, he has brought him in Hebrew unto he unto us to mock us. He came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice. And it came to pass when he had when he heard that I I lifted up my voice and cried and that he left his garment with me and fled and got him out. And she laid up his garment by her until his lord came home. And she came and she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The Hebrew servant which thou hast brought unto us came in unto me to mock me. And it came to pass as I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled out. And it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife which she spake unto him, saying, "After this manner did thy servant to me, that his wrath was kind old." And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were bound. And he was there in the prison. And the Lord was with Joseph. And the Lord was with Joseph. Everybody, everybody say that. And the Lord was with Joseph. &gt;&gt; And the Lord was with Joseph. &gt;&gt; All right. Now listen to this. And showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison. And whatsoever they did there, he was the doer of it. And the the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper. Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be seated tonight. Now I want you to see that um when he arrived in in the hand in the house of uh of Potifer, &gt;&gt; there is nothing that was under or in his hand that Pifer touched that it looked like it seemed as though actually it was that whatever he touched was his. that no one else touched. And in this case we find that he was given to take care of the entire household of Portifer. And so Portifer it came to a place whereby even Portifer did not know what he had. And when he when he went to prison, even in prison, no one uh the prison guard, the one who was supposed to be responsible for those duties, he handed over to Joseph. He said, "Now, since you are here, Joseph, I I resigned my duties. Take over." Joseph was never a prisoner. He was sent to prison for a purpose. And that's how our seed of God is. The seed of God will always prosper. No matter which place, no matter what situation, no matter what condition, no matter what problem, if you a seed, no matter where you go, you have to prosper. Praise the name of the Lord. Why? Because you have received the son of prosecutority. Amen. He that has the son also has the father. Jesus is the son of prosperity. And Jesus today is not here physically but he's here in the form of his word. When a child of God receives the word. Amen. He has to live in prosperity. He has to walk in prosperity. He has to bask in prosperity. Every place, everything he touches, we must prosper. But the problem that we have, we do not receive the son of prosperity. And that's the problem. That is the problem. That is the main issue. The Bible says, "Seek ye the kingdom of God and all his righteousness and all the rest." What are the rest? Not some of the rest, but everything else. Name it. What do you have need of? Just think about it. Can you now begin to name it? Whatever you have need of, you might be needing a scholarship. You might be needing a job. You might be needing a wife. You might be needing a a a husband. You might be needing a child. Am I preaching to someone here tonight? Whatever you have need of, you might be needing a piece of land. You might be needing a house of your own or maybe a car. You know, am I mentioning things that some of you need? Where if I mention something you need, you better say, "Amen." You might be needing, you know, a bicycle or maybe you need a motorcycle or maybe you need, you know, an air ticket to go somewhere or maybe you need a visa. Now all those things he said in his word shall be addicted one after the other. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So when we talk about prosperity now listen to me carefully church. I have only one hour because of the limitation of Zoom. But if I don't get done I'll continue on Sunday. But for now I want you to just stay with me tonight. Praise the Lord. The brethren who attend midweek service are usually the ones on fire for God. So I want to hear more. Amen. I want to hear more. I receive it. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. We we want to have a hot church, not a cold one, not a lukewarm one. Amen. And so you talk about all these other things according to the promise of the word he promised he will add them. Tell your neighbor he will add them. He will add them. He will add them. Are you telling your neighbor he will add them? Turn around and tell your neighbor he will add them. He will add them. We should be believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; We should be believers and that is why we should not believe for small things. We should believe for big things you know things of substance and see and other things otherwise. It might even be healing. Whatever it is that you have in life, he promise he will add. Maybe you want your business to boom. He will do it. You have to have faith. Maybe you want to succeed in your exams. He promise he will do it. Do you know? Do you know? We have very many testimonies of people who did not even read properly but you know they trusted God so much and when they went in the paper you know before they could go in the paper. They would dream the whole paper and then go to the paper and pass it find everything they saw in the night was what? So God helped them cheat. I'm not saying you should be lazy to study and think that God will help you cheat. But I believe if you are a son of God who has received the word in your heart and you are a genuine believer, you cannot fail exam. Hallelujah. You should pass and be one of the best. You should not be a tail. You should be ahead in everything you do. You must seek to excel. But the problem that we have many chase after this thing, many chase after money, many ch after visa, many chess after a building, many chess after this and that and wife, husband and you know friend and you know building and car and which God promised he will but he promised he will add. He never said he will give. He said he will add. Are you following me? Add to what? If you seek the right thing, if you seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things he will add. The word is prosperity. Prosperity. Amen. Is you cannot claim to have it. only if you have the son of prosperity. We found on Sunday that prosperity means where is is from the Hebrew which means shalak which means to rush to advance to push forward to make progress to succeed be profitable. So the problem is many people want to go forward. Many want people they want to pro progress succeed in their academics, succeed in the in in their this and their job, succeed in their marriage, succeed but they do not have the ingredient to succeed. That is why it is so sad that in our generation in our age that is called the people of this age actually think that they are prosperous according to them they think they're prosperous but according to God he doesn't think so. So in other words, someone can acquire all the wealth of the world but not be prosperous. Someone may have nothing of this world but actually be prosperous. All right. Now let let us proceed here. If you follow me, I'm sure you'll be blessed. If you look at Revelation 3, we read it on Sunday which he says this is the message the angel of the church of the Ladyians. [Music] He says these things say the amen faithful and a true witness. Amen. The beginning of the creation of God. The amen. The so be it. Amen. And and he and he says I know thy works. I know you are neither cold nor hot. I would thou art what cold or hot. So then because thou at lukewarm and neither cold nor hot, I will spew thee out of my mouth. Because thou sayest, I am rich. I am increased with goods and have need of nothing. And you know not that you are rich, miserable, poor, blind, naked. I want you to imagine this is the worst case scenario [Music] of someone who is actually in this situation, but they don't know they in this situation. I hope you are not one of them. Imagine being wretched, being miserable, being poor, poor, blind, naked, but you don't know. So you don't behave as if you are. So the people we are talking about here are not the people who are necessarily aware of their condition. Is the spirit of the age. They think they are rich. They think they increased with good and and but yet they have nothing. But they think they have need of nothing. And I wanted to quote for you out of the Leadian church 8. And I want you to follow closely. He says, "Now anybody knows that it is um lukewarm water that makes you sick at the stomach. Lukewarm water is about the best thing to drink. If you want to vote, church has made sick, God sick, and he has declared he will spew it out. Oh, it reminds us how God felt before the flood. Oh, would to God the church were cold or hot. You know, before the flood, the church thought they were prosperous. The world thought that we has prospered. Do you know in the days of Noah that the earth had prospered naturally speaking even more than our generation. [Music] You see, you think that we are developed but the development of the days of Noah is actually much more than ours today. We have not reached where they had reached. You remember in the days of Noah before the flood there were buildings like the great pyramid of Giza which until today but no one has been able to replicate. Not even the great USA, you know, they have not been able to redo it, you know. And the prophet says, "Nobody knows who built it." And then he says, "Well, I know it's is um and then he says it is Enoch that built it." Why? Because he was a prophet. Everything was perfect and accurate, you know, and and you know, he goes to in the geometry and he begins to talk about it and try and show how it was God's second Bible. Those of you who have been reading the message, you know we have three Bibles. &gt;&gt; God has had three Bibles. The first Bible is is the stars. The the the the the moon and the sun and you know talk about astronomy and you know then the second is the this great pyramid. And the third one is right here. And then he quotes and he says, "You remember the three wise men? They were reading the first Bible and the first Bible led them to Christ." Praise the name of the Lord. And and you see uh the second Bible was also pointing none to none nothing else but Christ. It was built like all the other pyramids, but it's the only pyramid that did not actually have the capstone. And you know when you come to the third Bible, it also talks about the same thing. How the how Jesus was rejected, how Christ was rejected. And you know it says the stone which was rejected it became the chief cornerstone. So we see that those three Bibles are interrelated interconnected. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And so well we'll continue right here. So then he says best of all she would be fant. She is not. Sentence has been passed. And maybe what I wanted to say right there is that uh in the days of the flood these people had the world it had arrived at a great civilization. But after the flood we noticed that you know where everything went down and then they started building again. They thought they were progressing before the flood. Listen, you cannot progress if you reject the word of the hour. You can only progress if you are walking in the word of the hour. They rejected the word of the hour. The word of the hour can only come through a prophet. According to Amos 3:7, the Bible says God will do nothing but he will reveal his secrets to his servants the prophet. So in every generation before anything major happens, God will send a prophet and this prophet will have thus sayeth the Lord. Whatever he says is not up for debate. God has a very a big sense of humor. He will always bypass the paved way, the beaten path. &gt;&gt; He lives it. He bypasses and then he comes to a way or through a way that no one knew. Imagine in the days of Noah there were the big religions like we have today. But God bypassed all and used a man called Noah. The Bible says Noah found grace in the sight of God. There is something about Noah in connection with Joseph that both Noah and Joseph found grace in the sight of God. There is something in connection to other people. Abraham found grace. Mary found grace. And all these people that actually found grace They had received something that nobody else had received. They had received a message. Amen. From God. And I tell you something that we have found grace. We bride in this last day. Amen. We are not like other birds. We are a different kind of bird. Oh, we are not vultures. We are not any kind of bird. A vulture that eats good and bad. We are a kind of bird that feeds on specific food. We cannot eat rotten food. We eat fresh kill. That's why we are eagles. &gt;&gt; An eagle will only eat a fresh kill. Amen. The Bible says wherever the carcass is, there the eagle's gone. Fresh killed. They will gather around it. What are they needing? They want to be fed. They are favored. I say like Mary, Mary received a word from the angel of the Lord. Nobody else understood what was going on. But Mary was favored. Do you know you are favored? Do you know you are not a denomination? And because you are not part of any denomination, you are highly favored. You are favored. &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say I am favored? Amen. If you are favored, &gt;&gt; hear this now. If you are favored, it means you must be prosperous every step of the way. Hallelujah. Amen. It means you must progress. Whatever you do, you must progress. You must go forward. You cannot go back from glory to glory to glory because you are blessed. If you're favored, it means you are blessed. The angel told Mary and I say we too are highly favored. We are highly favored. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. We have received something that this world knows nothing about. the the self that we can see you know is is our garment. Let's follow let's follow this. He says oh talks about a lukewarm church. Oh God still has a voice for the people of the world even as he has given a voice to the bride. That voice is in the bride. as we have said and we will talk about that later. Look at the first phrase of this verse. Because thou sayest, see they were speaking. I'm He talking about the other birds now. He's talking about the other denominations. He's talking about you know the rest of the world. They were talking saying that they are rich. So God so they were talking as the mouthpiece of God. This proves exactly what I said. He says but though they say it does not make it right. The Catholic church says that she speaks for God. Saying she is the assured voice of the Lord. How many people can be so spiritually wicked is more than I know. But they produce according to the seed which is in them. And we know where the seed their seed came from. And we know where our seed come from. The spoken word is the original seed. We have received an original seed, not a hybrid. The original what preached. We speak what the Bible say. That makes us the original. Follow me closely. That that was her self-esteem. &gt;&gt; The Laian church is saying I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing. She looked at herself and that is what she saw. She said I am rich. Which means that she is wealthy in the things of this world. [Music] She is boasting in the face of James 2:5. &gt;&gt; What does James 2:5 say? It says, "Harken, my beloved, brethren, has not God chosen the poor of this world, rich in hes of the kingdom, which he has promised to them that love him. But ye have despised the poor. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why they preach the kind of the way they preach. They say, "Well, if you don't have money, you you are cast." To them, money is equals to God. Money is equals to the blessing. But in this case, we see that's not so. They have all but they are poor and they do not know. Do not I would rather be called poor when I am rich than calling myself rich when I am poor and I don't know. Do not rich men oppress you and draw you before the judgment seats. Do not they blasphem that worthy name by which ye are called? Now I do not suggest that a rich person cannot be spiritual. But we all know that the word says very few are. It is the poor that predominate uh in the body of the true church. Most of the believers in the world are actually poor. Not only in our generation but even the generations before us. You see now then if the church becomes full of wealth we know only one thing which means the glory is departed. It has been written over her portals. We can't deny that for that is the word. And we see it even in countries, nations where when before they became wealthy, they received God and God was moving in their country and they took the gospel all over the world. But when now they received the wealth of the world, they kicked Jesus Christ out. They received the God of the world. You've seen it even when they have their games. They're bringing back the idolatry which was there in the 1600s. And now here in Africa, many of us are poor. And you will find because of that, you have a lot of believers in our churches. And even when these go to Europe and other countries and they make a little bit of money, they walk away, they go back again to the world. And I hope you don't serve God because you are poor. Don't come here because you want God to give you some money. Church is not a place to make money. No. Church is a place to find God. Church is a place to find something the world cannot gain. If you want to make money, you go make money in the business place. You know he promised. Amen. If you have received the word, there is a promise. You will be prosperous. You will succeed in everything you do. You might have a little business when you go out there. God will make you to succeed. When you are in school, God will make you to succeed. You know what? That's true prosperity. Talk about wealth in the church. Why they never there has never been such a show of wealth like today. The beautiful sanctuaries They are multiplied in number as never before. The various groups v with each other to see who can build the biggest and loveliest and they build education centers worth unimated millions and those buildings are used only an hour or two a week. Now that would not be uh such a terrible thing but they expect this little time spent by the children in the education plant to take the place of the hours of training supposed to be given in the home. That's why parents must train their children. We must not expect that it the the schools can train our children. Schools can never take a place of a mother or a father. Do we believe that money has powered into the church until different denominations own stocks and bonds and factories, oils and and insurance companies. They have powered money into welfare. and retirement funds. Now, this sounds good, but it has become a snare to the ministers. For if they decide to leave their group for more light or the love of God, their tensions are lost to them. Most can't even say and can't can't even stand and and stay with their pressure groups. They can't stand this and stay with their pressure groups. Now listen, I would love to talk about all that but I have limited time. So let's continue. Now don't forget that this is the last age. We know that this is the last age because Israel has gone back to Palestine. If we believe that he is really coming, then there must be something wrong with those who are building so vastly. It makes one thing that these people plan on staying here forever. Oh, that the coming of Jesus is hundreds of years old. You see the what this the quote that I'm reading right here. is one of the reasons why in our in our rooms many believers did not even go ahead to build churches or big churches because they they like okay for us we believe it's coming quickly but the ones who are building don't believe [Music] but you need to understand the spirit within which brother was saying these things you know he's talking about the denominations who do not have the son of prosperity. He's not talking about believers who have received the word. Do do you know that religion today is known as a big business? It is an absolute fact that they are placing business managers in the churches to take care of finances. Is this what God desires? Did not his word teach us in the book of Acts that seven men full of the Holy Ghost and faith serve the Lord in the in business matters. You can surely see why God said you are you you say you are wealthy. I never said so. You see, there are radio programs, &gt;&gt; television programs, &gt;&gt; numerous church endeavors that are costing millions and millions of dollars. Uhhuh. Now, right here again, they said, you see, we don't believe in having TV. We don't believe in having radio program because it will cost a lot of money. Brother talked about it. You need to understand the spirit within which he say these things. You need to to read between the lines. Praise the name of the Lord. Who is he speaking about the big denomination? The ones who have rejected the word. The moment any church rejects the word, they become because they have rejected God. They have rejected a son of prosperity. They can never prosper. regardless of how much money they have, regardless of how much wealth they have. Look, prosperity means succeeding, means going forward. So, where are they going? They are going nowhere because they can't go to the rapture. The body of the bride, the body of Christ, the word body is going forward because we are going in a rapture soon and very soon. We are going to see the king. Listen, it's not about our church. That's why we are not preaching our church. We are not preaching our prophet. We are not preaching our bastards. Our message is about Christ. We are talking about him. The one who died for us. Listen Christ is the word. Don't be deceived. Christ is the word. But when they reject the word, they have rejected the Christ. And he said, "Be aware lest any man spoil you through philosophy, through vain deceit, after the traditions of men, the rudiments of the world, but not after Christ." So you see friends, this is about Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are preaching Christ, preach it on the television. preach on the radio. Amen. It's okay to have a big program to do that as long as you are not fathering your church. [Music] We are furthering the the gospel. We are fathering Christ. Amen. So wealth powers and powers into the church. The membership increases along with the money. Yet this is the sad story. Yet the work is not being done. That's why I say they're not prospering. The work is not being done as it was done when there was no money. But men rested solely on the ability given them by the Holy Ghost. I fear that even us as believers of this message have not come to a place where we have made so much money that we have forgotten why we should make money. He's trying to show Listen, don't miss this. He's trying to show you that in the the church of the last days made so much money the membership of the church has increased. They boast of hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, you know. They bust of having big membership. Talk about having mega churches. Of course, the money has also increased in offerings and in what has the church accomplished. He says it has accomplished so little. It has done so little compared to what they did when they had so little money. What happened? They think they're rich and increase with good and have need of nothing. But because of their condition, God has said they are poor, wretched, blind, naked, and they don't know why. They took the wealth of the world and they enriched themselves. They forgot about the work of God. They forgot why they are here on earth. Listen, you are not here to build big buildings. You are here so that you may live the purpose that God has placed you here. The purpose of this church is to find souls. That's the purpose of the ministry. That's even your life's purpose. Whatever you do, the law that I might find one more soul. What can I do to find one more soul? That is the purpose of the home. That's the purpose of the church. Is the purpose of the word. He sent his word for what? For what? &gt;&gt; For building buildings. Answer me, church. For what? He sent his word to bring the last one. &gt;&gt; Forgotten the purpose of the work. Everybody cares about David never had a smartphone. David could not communicate with the whole world in one minute. as I'm speaking right now. Australia is hearing me. &gt;&gt; America is hearing me. German is hearing. &gt;&gt; Can you actually believe it? David never had that ability. We in our generation have that ability. What are you using it for? I say we have a cause. We have a reason to be here. Let us do it. Let us do more for the Lord. Let us be burdened for los. May God help us to understand this because we are here to go forward. The denominations are going behind. But you see the bride is moving on. The bride is moving on. Oh, brother Dan sung the song with brother Joel. Amen. I believe it. The church is moving on. The bride is moving on. Are you the bride? Where are we going? We are going to the rapture. That's what we being prepared for. We're being prepared for body change. Catch the vision. Tell your neighbor. Catch the vision. This is what it's all about. Whatever we are going to do, let's do it for that purpose. And then he says there are paid preachers, paid preachers, he's talking about this denomination and system that paid assistance, paid ministers of music. paid education and uh paid choirs, paid custodians, programs, entertainment, all costing great sums. But for all that, the power is decreasing. Yes, the church is rich but the power is not there. How can you say the power is there when sinners are not repenting? How can you say the power is there when sinners are increasing? When sin is increasing in the church says the power is gone. The glory is departed because God moves by his spirit not by the amount of money or talent in the church. I said God moves by his spirit. Let me tell you when God calls a man he gives him an assignment to go out and bring them in. go out to the streets to the byways and bring them in. It used to be young men on fire going on the street, going out to the hospital, going everywhere they could go in the school, evangelizing. They were in prayer. They were hungering. They wereing to see the move of God. But where is that? Churches big money, but you only have gossip in the church. Preachers are paid, pastors are paid, ministers are paid, there's more money, but so little accomplished. And people have come to a place, I'm afraid, the church has come to a place where there can be almost no one ministering without being paid. It is so sad. It's very sad, I tell you. But the spirit of the edge, but the bride is yet to break in this message. We still have men who will preach with or without a paycheck who are called to preach because of a burden who are doing what they are doing for the Lord because they have a calling of God upon their life whereby no man can stop them. I remember when one day in Ethiopia I drove 16 hours to go from &gt;&gt; all the way to Ben Shangulang. That's a place near Sudan. &gt;&gt; And I drove that distance because I had I I got in contact with some young men at a university. I think about one or two that felt showed interest in the word and that's a long journey. That's a lot of money. But I told the church that I was pastoring in Adis that look I have to go there and until today I wonder how did I do that 15 hours nonstop must have been something more than physical power can do more than more than money can do. Something else was driving me. I remember we drove about 10 hours reach somewhere and you know I was so dizzy I was almost passing out because it is a small car bad road. I tell you we we when we came out right there we had a revival. We had a group I still have those pictures. We had a group of young people who came about 10 or 15 and we preached this message to them. We preached this message to them. We actually baptized some of them. Let me tell you, Amen. Those who refuse to hear that day, Amen. We will bear them witness. They will bear us witness. We preached. Let me tell you brother, there has to be something driving the church. Something unseen. Something more than money. Something that is so rich. Something that is so rich in our hearts. Amen. Something pushing us. Something making us to go forward. It can only be Christ. It can only be Jesus. He's a son of prosperity. He will keep us going forward. Moving forward cannot fail. There will be others who will give their substance their money to the work of God. Many times we want to do this, do that, do that. And people think when they give to the work of God, they helping the pastor. They're moving the pastor's idea. Oh, I feel so sorry for such a person. Let me tell you, brother, sister, we have a cause. You have to catch the vision. We are here for a reason. Mine might be to speak to you. Maybe yours is to pray. Maybe yours is to give money. Maybe yours is to do something. Do whatever you have to do. Let us go forward. Amen. Because this is a work of God. It has to move. It can only move by the spirit, &gt;&gt; not by money. So whether you give or you do not give, the work of God can never fail. We need to have that understanding. As a church, as a body of believers in this end time, we have something to do. If you're a musician, that's your post of duty. Do it like you're going to die. If you're a preacher, preach like you are going to die. If they don't hear, you have done your job. Witness your neighbor like as if you're going to die. If you're an interpreter, interpret as if you're going to die. Do something and do it with all your might. If you're a singer, sing knowing you're not singing for people to hear your voice. You know the church is moving on. And he says, "Now I want to show you how diabolical this urge for money has become. The churches have gone all out to get a membership, especially of the wealthy. Churches in Africa are even beginning to start churches in in in in Europe and other places. What are they looking for? They're looking for the wealthy so that they can support their scheme. But I tell you friend, the church of Jesus is moving on. And it's not moving on by money. It's moving on by his spirit. The churches have gone all out to get a membership, especially for the wealthy. We are not we are not competing for membership. We have no law but love, no membership but fellowship, no but Christ. And I thank God for this message of the hour because we have been set loose. We have been loosened. We have been set free from all those churches that were so hungry for membership. We are not here so we can get a big membership. Whether you are 100, I'll preach. Whether you're 1,000, I will preach. When you become 10,000, I'll preach. If you are two, I'll still preach. And let me tell you, I will not change what I'm preaching. I'll preach it the way the word say. And I am not the only one. There are many like me all over the world that are anointed by God to preach this message of the hour to many of you. Praise God. My time is up. Let me try to finish now. Everywhere there is a cry to make a religion so attractive and appealing that the rich and cultured and all rather appealing that the rich and cultured and all who have worldly prestige will come in and and be active in the church. You know try to have a good media presence. This one copying this one and this one copying that one. This one saying I'm done. I'm doing the best and everything. May God help us. May we never do anything out of pressure. Let's do things out of the leadership of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not seeking to be like somebody else. seeking to be like Christ. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Can they understand that if the if wealth is the criterion of spirituality, [Music] then the world already has God, has all of God, and the church has nothing. Because the world has more money than you. &gt;&gt; So it's not money that measures how much of God you have. Thou say some increased with diamonds. This literally means I have spiritual riches. This sounds like the millennium with the with the with the streets of God and the presence of God. But I wonder if this is so. Is the church truly rich in the spiritual things of God? Let us examine this 20th century book in the light of the world. And we're going to do that examination on Sunday. But I tell you, friend, there's something you have to do. Be active in the work of God. If I was to die, I would want to be remembered as somebody who invested my time, my resources, my money, my family, my substance, everything that I had in the work of God would be a good legacy. What about you? Let's bow our heads tonight. Father Lord. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for this word that you've given to us. Lord help us that we may not stray away Lord. But we will run in this race that we will not bring you disgrace. Lord, help us that we will please you in all that we do. In all that we do. Lord Jesus, bless the people that have been listening in tonight, those live and those on Zoom and Father, just pray that your grace will abound in our hearts. Grant I pray in the name of Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you, sir. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I have brother Amram come up? And we just want to if you can stand on your feet and Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Praise God. I just want us to sing a few songs as we are giving our offerings and worshiping the Lord a little bit. Amen.

And Lord, we thank you because victory belongs to you. You are the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. You are high and lifted up. Father Lord, as we want to leave this place tonight, I pray that these words that have been spoken tonight, you will impress it upon the hearts of the people. that they will they will have meaning in their hearts that you will convict us Lord that you will help us to please you in everything that we do. Granted, Lord, be with us now as we dismiss and bless everyone that has given Lord as we have given our offerings and may you prosper us Lord that we may continue serving you in Jesus mighty name we pray. Amen. [Music] The Lord bless you saints. Uh just wanted to um you can have your seat for just a minute or two. I just wanted to uh give an announcement or two. Um cuz I know that u there there could be those that are streaming or those who are here but we are not here on Sunday. We shall announce it again on Sunday. and also those who were here on Sunday. Some of you have misunderstood um regarding our land uh fund project. We thank God for the far he has brought us. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a he's a faithful God. And so to those who do not know, we we already found the land. We raised up to 100 million shillings. [Music] and I've already paid it. Now, um the land total sum is a total sum of 220 million and 500,000. So now we are remaining with 120 and 500,000. So now we are supposed to pay this money. We have an allowance of 12 months. But we as a church are targeting to pay it in 6 months. To those who are wondering whether that is possible or not, I want to tell you it is possible. It's it's very possible only if we can work together. You know, united we stand, divided we fall. So let us stand together. Nothing is small. &gt;&gt; You enter into this inspiration and tell them don't interpret me. Just tell them and you will see the words coming. Nothing is small. &gt;&gt; Nothing. &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. I'm teaching him how to interpret. And and he's a very good interpreter, isn't he? &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing is small. &gt;&gt; Nothing. and and do not undermine your giving because it is making a difference. Don't say 120 I mean million I've even never touched one million in my hand. We shall make it together. It is possible. So the plan is we want to as a church to pledge out all this money completely to pledge that completely so that we know it is fully pledged out. We know that if it was like a goat, if we went to out to hunt and we've brought out a god and now we we say here is a god everybody take a piece then you you see those who are taking big pieces small pieces Others will take a little leg but at the end everybody will take some and in a minute all of it will be divided across the whole congregation. That's the way that's the strategy we have. Let us pledge it out completely and then we begin collecting slowly. Already we have been collecting per week. So the confusion was people thought they're going to give per week and again pledge what you pledged whenever you pay per week. We have developed a system on the computer. Whatever and we are still in the process of finalizing it. Whatever you pay will automatically be reduced from your pledge. So um let's see whatever you have given this two past two weeks because we started this system these past two weeks. This is the third week. So, um, whatever you've given this past two weeks has already paid off from your total pledge. You understand? So, we have a total of about 75 million pledged for now. Quickly, someone count how much are we remaining with? 45 &gt;&gt; and the individuals who have pledged out the 75 are like about 50 or less. The rest of the 50 can really pledge out that very easily. Brother Steven, you pledged nothing. Brother Joel, you pledged nothing. My brother here, sister Rachel, you have pledged nothing. There are many who have pledged nothing here. And let me tell you, I was talking to my young people and I told them, you younger people, we are doing this for you, for your children. Those who think this is not possible. Pledge by faith and begin paying slowly. People will be surprised at an adult or 40 years will be surprised to see a child of 17 years that after one year they have paid 1 million. You'll be surprised and it is going to happen. You wait and see. But how we're going to do it is uh every week you give &gt;&gt; as you are able. And in this case we are not competing. We this past 78 weeks we were looking at how many have given. Okay 7. Okay let me give 10. But now we are competing with our pledge. If I've pledged 10 million every week I can give 1 million 500,000 200,000. I don't care how much others I've given. So we are going to begin hearing here every week. Maybe you will find that every week 5 million 10 million out of the collections. Why? Because people are paying their pledges. Let's do this friends and you'll be surprised. We will get this done within no time. Within no time. It is very much possible. A brother told me today pastor after we have finished this and it has worked people's eyes are going to open. Even those who have never saved 1 million they will say ah in six months I've given 1 million to the work of God. It means I'm able also to do it and you will find them doing it for their own property. Amen. That's what we believe. So I just want to clarify that I will do that again on Sunday. First thing pledge through a group. If you're not a member of any group, join a group. Yeah. Join a group. We have seven groups. Join one of those groups and pledge in one of those groups. And some people have been saying, "Oh, now me I don't want to pledge." I'm fearing pledge. Fear is of the devil. Don't fear. Don't fear. One of these days, I don't know if if I'll see how I'm feeling on Sunday. There is something I want to share with you regarding the revelation of giving. I'll see. Just pray for me. Then we'll see how the Lord will lead me on Sunday. We need to just cash the revenge. So don't fear. Someone said, "I I don't want to give but yet every they don't want to pledge. Yet every week they've been given 20,000 and above and it was possible for 78 weeks. You understand? And uh so it is possible don't fear to pledge out 2 million 1 million 1.5 you just take it and multiply it by weeks divides it in six months you will see it is possible very much possible you just have to be consistent and um God is training us for something there is more in the store for us more in store for us God bless you saints you're dismissed in Jesus Come that love the Lord and let our joys be known. Join in a song with sweet. Join in a song with sweet. and down around the throne and dance around the throne. Oh, we're maring to Zion. Beautiful, beautiful. [Music] will maring power to Zion. A beautiful city of Lord. [Music] Oh my lord refuse to sing. Oh my God. Oh my children of the heavenly king. My children all by
