[0:00] after the questions we will take in um
[0:03] some questions from the few people that
[0:05] will be here as well
[0:28] as
[0:58] for
[1:16] uh welcome to the bench I am pastori
[1:19] your host now today on the bench we are
[1:23] s uh sitting down with a man who despite
[1:26] a very hard and rough background he
[1:30] turned 200 naira that is about $400 into
[1:33] a multi-million dollar conglomerate one
[1:36] of the top most successful Africans in
[1:38] Africa and notice I said Africans in
[1:41] Africa I will pick more on that later is
[1:45] a believer of the enti message and a
[1:47] preacher of the
[1:49] Gospel now sir it's a honor to have you
[1:52] today and thousands of young people
[1:55] follow this program and will be impacted
[1:57] by your words of wisdom would would you
[2:00] please greet uh our
[2:06] audience God bless you Shalom bride of
[2:10] Christ around the world wherever you are
[2:13] in Africa listening to us we welcome you
[2:17] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[2:21] Christ now everyone is interested in
[2:24] knowing who is Dr kosmas maduka and how
[2:27] did you arrive at your success I thought
[2:29] we should be begin with
[2:31] that well
[2:33] um brother cosas Med the way I usually
[2:38] would like to be
[2:40] addressed um I'm a
[2:43] Christian um a lot of people want
[2:47] to address me as
[2:50] um um a rich man or a wealthy man
[2:55] different form subject to where they met
[2:59] me and the way they know me but I love
[3:02] to be addressed as brother cosmas M and
[3:06] that's who I am I'm a Christian my
[3:10] Christian principles and value means so
[3:14] much to
[3:15] me um it's something that amazes a lot
[3:19] of people
[3:21] sometime they wonder and said oh brother
[3:26] you are too humble how do you get down
[3:30] to do things as I said please don't
[3:32] speak don't talk like that just
[3:35] understand that there is a
[3:38] different
[3:40] between a Christian that God bless with
[3:45] money and a rich man who became a
[3:48] Christian so I am a Christian who God
[3:52] blessed with money I am not a rich man
[3:55] who become a Christian amen amen well uh
[3:59] that is very very interesting because
[4:01] notable for Africa not
[4:03] only uh the Africans that have been
[4:05] successful here but also those who live
[4:08] abroad I've met quite a few and you will
[4:10] notice that even the other brothers will
[4:12] say Well when black people get money
[4:14] they kind of behave in a indifferent and
[4:18] so to find someone that God has blessed
[4:20] and he recognizes that they a Christian
[4:22] before they a successful person to me I
[4:26] think that is something of not uh that
[4:28] many uh of young people can learn from
[4:31] thank you um then the other question the
[4:33] other part of the question was uh maybe
[4:36] we can give you a little time to you
[4:38] know narrate and not only narrate but
[4:40] also tell our young people how you
[4:42] arrived here because the reason why I
[4:45] ask this question is we have a lot of
[4:48] get rich quick schemes sure and brother
[4:50] bam talked about that and many young
[4:52] people think that they can arrive at
[4:53] wealth in just a blink of an eye you
[4:55] know invest you know one you know one
[4:58] naira or one sh Shillings and get 500
[5:00] million in in an overnight yeah so how
[5:04] how was this possible for you okay you
[5:06] know um my story sometime I thought it
[5:10] could have been balling to a lot of
[5:13] people because I have just simple one
[5:16] story that I've repeatedly you know tell
[5:19] around the world um but as an individual
[5:23] I believe our story is somewhat unique
[5:27] unique in the sense that um um um I am a
[5:34] manifestation of the grace of God as an
[5:37] individual MH uh because
[5:40] um um when you people sing that
[5:46] hymn from grass to riches he took a
[5:50] beggar and make him a king I've never
[5:53] listen to that song without breaking
[5:56] down tears coming from my eyes MH
[5:59] because that song Tell My Story
[6:03] absolutely my
[6:05] story
[6:07] um I live to in my generation I just
[6:12] think God raised me up to show
[6:16] people that there is no mountain that is
[6:21] insurmountable there's no hair that is
[6:24] too high to Crime William Braham the
[6:28] prophet of this age
[6:30] let us know that it is our attitude yes
[6:34] that brings the result
[6:36] mhm um and he said that from experience
[6:41] he didn't just said that off his head
[6:44] mhm but was gifted he was a messenger
[6:48] and a prophet for a
[6:50] generation but he never closed his leg
[6:54] and sit back and said because I am a
[6:56] messenger I am called for this uh
[7:00] uh generation God will just download all
[7:04] informations from my head but you could
[7:07] still see him really
[7:10] committed to his call yes what I try to
[7:15] tell young people is to pursue purpose
[7:19] and life yes if you pursue
[7:23] purpose every other 10 will add to it m
[7:27] and what is purpose M purpose is the
[7:31] reason why purpose is why you exist
[7:37] purpose
[7:38] is why things is
[7:41] made and the things that are made 90%
[7:45] Almost 100% of the time don't know its
[7:49] purpose the purpose is only in the mind
[7:53] of the mea the manufacturer if you ask
[7:56] this bottle of water why were you made
[7:58] he will not answer you he didn't know
[8:00] yeah but if you ask the person who made
[8:02] it he will tell you this is made for
[8:07] refreshment you can drink it is water if
[8:10] you ask this chair this where were you
[8:13] made he did not know so if you want to
[8:17] know you ask the maker mhm so who is the
[8:21] maker of human being God God so if you
[8:24] don't understand your purpose of
[8:28] existence that's the reason why you need
[8:30] to go to God exactly because the
[8:34] manufacturer build success in everything
[8:38] that is
[8:39] made but a lot of people try
[8:43] to approach Life by presuming MH if you
[8:48] do not understand purpose M abuse will
[8:54] be
[8:55] inevitable if I don't know that this was
[8:59] made as a table M to hold laptop to hold
[9:02] water I can decide to stand on it I may
[9:05] think it's uh um I I think that uh it's
[9:09] a standing uh I can sit on it if I'm
[9:12] sitting on this or standing on it I'm
[9:14] abusing it exactly and why am I abusing
[9:17] it because I did not know the purpose
[9:19] for which it is made yeah so if it
[9:23] doesn't serve his purpose M then abuse
[9:27] will become inevitable m many people
[9:30] abused their life because they did not
[9:32] know the purpose of their
[9:35] existence now let me back up I was born
[9:38] to one
[9:40] loin that's my mother's name and my
[9:43] father's name is
[9:44] Peter
[9:46] maduk uh 65 years
[9:49] ago um within the four years of my
[9:53] existence onto the Earth my father went
[9:56] to be with the
[9:58] Lord I was a young man who do not know
[10:01] my left or right put your eyes in the
[10:04] mind of a four years baby mhm um the
[10:09] generation I grew up with those days you
[10:12] have to fake sickness to be able to eat
[10:15] rice rice used to be a delicacy a
[10:18] special food and uh only you can only
[10:21] get it if not for a festival you need to
[10:26] really be sick and refuse to eat other
[10:28] food and they ask you can't we find you
[10:31] something to eat what will you eat then
[10:33] you say rice but there was this
[10:36] particular day that everybody was kind
[10:39] to me I ate rice more than five times or
[10:43] eight times anybody pass what you eat
[10:45] rice and I was saying oh my God what a
[10:48] wonderful day this kind of day should
[10:50] never end and uh I I you know some
[10:53] people are come trooping into our house
[10:56] it was like a festival you know and uh
[10:59] um maset were coming people were beating
[11:02] music and things but I saw my mother
[11:06] unlike the rest of everybody feeling
[11:08] happy on the one corner of the wall her
[11:11] hair scattered she was crying and I was
[11:14] asking I was making her angry everybody
[11:16] is Happy why is she uh
[11:19] unhappy L little did I know that that
[11:23] was the funeral of my father but I saw
[11:26] my father in a black suit with a white
[11:29] on a bow tie lying on a bed so I
[11:33] thought he was taking a nap H I didn't
[11:36] know what it is but letter in my life
[11:40] that's the best I can say I knew my
[11:42] father so life was rough uh gave me no
[11:46] opportunity to survive or become
[11:49] anything in life um it was really really
[11:53] difficult but I still respect a lot of
[11:57] Godly women
[11:59] uh William Braham the prophet of this
[12:01] age told us that a Godly mother is the
[12:04] first pastor of the house yes and that
[12:07] the New Testament has four book and the
[12:10] mother is the Fifth Gospel oh um I can
[12:14] truly say I experienced that with my
[12:16] mother my mother was not a Pentecostal
[12:19] or a message person but was a devoted
[12:22] Catholic and really you know she was
[12:26] committed to her belief mhm
[12:29] and
[12:30] um if you ask me to say I would say
[12:33] created the hunger of God in Me because
[12:36] she wakes us up when I was in that age
[12:40] early morning by 5:00 for morning
[12:44] devotion and we had to pray Catholic
[12:46] Rosary you know in Our Father who is in
[12:49] heaven you know after that we say hell
[12:51] Mary full of grace 10 times
[12:55] repeatedly and that was where initially
[12:59] it was difficult but like everything in
[13:03] life practice makes perfect yes and the
[13:06] more you do things the more you get
[13:09] accustomed to it and you love it I saw
[13:12] my mother pray all night
[13:15] really Desiring for God because life was
[13:20] unfair to her she was at tender age her
[13:24] husband went to be with the Lord and he
[13:26] has four kids to take care of so she
[13:29] doesn't have anybody but God and
[13:33] introduce try to introduce this God to
[13:36] us when I was too young so many time we
[13:40] wake up and we feeling sleepy sometime
[13:43] he will use her five pums on our botom
[13:46] to wake us up or any of us feeling
[13:49] sleepy if you that sleep never left you
[13:52] she has a cup of water she emptied it in
[13:54] your head that was the worst that I
[13:57] almost hate God for that one I just said
[13:59] what kind of God is this that this cold
[14:01] water come on your head ear in the
[14:03] morning then sleep will disappear but
[14:06] that was how she knew that's the best
[14:09] she knew she has good
[14:11] intention so from then when I started
[14:14] growing up I wasn't waiting for my
[14:16] mother again to lead me for prayer I
[14:19] started praying on my own you know
[14:21] started having hunger and desire for god
[14:25] um we were Catholics that's our
[14:27] background um um I became an alter boy
[14:31] yes I was an alter boy you know I was a
[14:33] mass servant you know try everything I
[14:35] can but
[14:39] again if the way to live a life is to be
[14:44] honest yes if there's anything even till
[14:47] today when I talk to Believers I said if
[14:50] there's one thing God want us to bring
[14:53] on the table yes it's our honest of
[14:55] purpose forget your mistake forget about
[14:58] anything because you are human being but
[15:01] will you be honest to own up not looking
[15:05] for anybody to hold you in your Adam's
[15:07] ample to get you to accept when you are
[15:10] wrong exactly God required that depth of
[15:13] sincerity sinc and if there's anything
[15:15] that set William Braham has apart from
[15:18] his contemporary was that level of depth
[15:21] of sincerity in approach to God
[15:24] yeah because he knew you can't fool God
[15:27] you can fool a man but you can't fool
[15:29] God so if you can approach god with that
[15:32] attitude of depth of
[15:35] sincerity the sky is your limit yeah in
[15:38] fact you won't have limit because what
[15:41] William BL told us that a man or a woman
[15:44] that completely surrender his heart to
[15:47] God is an omin poent when God can get
[15:50] you to a point you have no reservation
[15:53] you truly want to empty out and let him
[15:56] come in then he can use you you because
[16:00] the the number one enemy you have is not
[16:03] your husband it's not your wife it's not
[16:05] your uncle it's not your children it's
[16:07] not your father he yourself exactly so
[16:10] if you can get yourself out of the way
[16:12] mhm then God will have his way in your
[16:14] life yeah so while you continue sorry to
[16:17] interrupt you you spoke of of your
[16:20] mother so it all whenever I hear you
[16:22] tell this story it really reminds me of
[16:25] my mother and you know most of the
[16:28] people that are listening to us a young
[16:29] people as I told you of this and we see
[16:32] that uh the younger generation the women
[16:35] no longer want to uh be women and they
[16:37] no longer want to be wives and take care
[16:40] of children and train them and raise
[16:41] them in the fear of God but if um a
[16:44] Catholic mother can be able to do that
[16:46] and instill the fear of God in you how
[16:49] much more a believing woman can do well
[16:52] I think a believing woman should do much
[16:55] better uh in every sense because we were
[16:59] once like half spiritual Amia but when
[17:04] we came into this message this end time
[17:08] message God sent William Braham to
[17:11] reveal the heart of God to us yeah so we
[17:14] we are like having an open book we are
[17:17] not gazing Stars anymore we are not
[17:19] supposed to be speculating we are not
[17:21] nois we should know better nobody I've
[17:25] never heard it from anybody that mother
[17:27] is the first pastor of the house I never
[17:29] heard it from anybody that that the
[17:33] gospel had fif gospel and mother should
[17:36] occupy that place so B had used
[17:39] different words to show us how important
[17:42] a mother is exactly because most of the
[17:45] problem we have today Frankly Speaking
[17:48] is not child delinquent many parent are
[17:52] delc it's parent deliquency that we are
[17:55] going through there is no authority
[17:58] figure go in the house anymore people
[18:01] are not properly guided how they should
[18:05] live and the love the the parents need
[18:08] to show to their children to be able to
[18:11] you know take them on but let me say
[18:14] that many people can use this as excuse
[18:18] to their life why they are not important
[18:21] but if you think that is
[18:23] excuse I can also have good excuse
[18:27] because part of the excuse is that I
[18:28] didn't have father care Over Me growing
[18:33] up so at the end of the day we are
[18:38] individually responsible for the choices
[18:42] we
[18:43] made many time we don't like it because
[18:47] we like to abrigate responsibility
[18:51] looking for who to blame why we are not
[18:54] who we are supposed to be MH but heart
[18:59] statement the truth is that every one of
[19:02] us is a sum total of choices we have
[19:06] made in life that's right that's right
[19:07] okay many time we don't acknowledge or
[19:11] appreciate it one wrong
[19:14] choice doesn't make
[19:17] you a failure MH one right choice
[19:21] doesn't make you successful M it's
[19:26] a it's a constant
[19:28] some total M of wrong choices you made
[19:32] over a period of time yeah you become a
[19:36] failure it's a su total of right choices
[19:40] you made over a period of time that make
[19:44] you successful yeah because nobody would
[19:47] say he had never made a mistake so the
[19:49] choices we make really matter exactly
[19:52] the choices we met in life make at the
[19:55] end of the day we are some total of the
[19:58] church choices we made and but a lot of
[20:04] people wonder how can I be successful
[20:09] yeah I
[20:12] believe this is my personal belief that
[20:15] success is predictable yeah okay and
[20:19] failure is also predictable okay
[20:25] because everything a manufacturer build
[20:29] he build success into it mhm so there is
[20:33] a
[20:34] law our
[20:37] success as human beings is good for God
[20:41] MH God want us to succeed every one of
[20:44] us God never build any of us to be a
[20:48] failure that's right but whether we
[20:52] succeed or fail m is up to us mhm I have
[20:57] had I've discussed with some young
[20:59] people and quite a number of times some
[21:02] of them told me where is the place of
[21:04] Grace in this thing I'm saying that I am
[21:06] too hard on them where is the place of
[21:09] Grace I said please listen carefully so
[21:12] that you can understand and appreciate
[21:14] it and they're listening and they
[21:16] listening I said Grace is an enablement
[21:21] but Grace is not disgrace
[21:25] okay if you read the scripture
[21:29] God told Joshua in Joshua Chapter
[21:34] 1:7 this book of
[21:37] law shall not depart from your mouth you
[21:42] shall meditate in it not only in the
[21:45] night not only in the day day and
[21:49] night then he say for D shall thou
[21:54] be
[21:57] successful there are conditions that is
[21:59] tied to it you don't just only meditate
[22:04] on the book but you you
[22:06] said that you should observe to do
[22:09] according to all that is written therein
[22:13] for then shall thou then shall th make
[22:17] thyself not your uncle not your brother
[22:20] not your sister not then shall thou make
[22:23] thyself prosperous
[22:26] so I then explained to some young people
[22:30] I said look many of you don't understand
[22:33] Destiny mhm I go to different church and
[22:37] I hear them sing a song Destiny changer
[22:41] come and change my destiny destiny today
[22:46] come and change my destiny destiny today
[22:50] I said when they get to that Destiny
[22:52] changer I keep
[22:54] quiet they asked me why did I keep quiet
[22:56] I said I don't want my change I love my
[22:59] destiny why am I
[23:01] CH you need your own change pray for it
[23:05] to be changed I don't want my own change
[23:07] I said let me tell you my understanding
[23:11] a little way for you to appreciate
[23:13] Destiny Okay I said if you are born in a
[23:18] rich man family
[23:21] yeah and you want to be a doctor M if
[23:26] that's your desire mm M and your father
[23:29] can pay your school fees to be a doctor
[23:33] you are destined to be a doctor a doctor
[23:36] but whether in real life you become a
[23:40] doctor or not is up to you
[23:43] mhm they say how I said because if you
[23:47] want to be a doctor this is a a a
[23:51] discussion you need to have by yourself
[23:54] you can't be a doctor because you say I
[23:57] want to I want to mhm you need to have
[24:01] self conversation MH I want to be a
[24:07] doctor you ask your you you you have
[24:11] discussion with yourself how mhm nobody
[24:14] become a doctor by mouth I want to
[24:17] that's right I want to doesn't make you
[24:19] a
[24:19] doctor so when you make that discussion
[24:23] self
[24:25] conversation I want to be a doctor you
[24:28] ask yourself how you answer the question
[24:31] it's a conversation you're having with
[24:33] yourself to be a doctor I need to be
[24:36] good in five science subject MH you are
[24:40] beginning okay I need to be good in math
[24:44] MH extra math English biology
[24:49] chemistry beautiful you are not good at
[24:53] it but you have identified them you are
[24:55] making progress exactly the the next
[24:58] thing is that can I get a doctor can I
[25:01] get a teacher who will teach me marks
[25:05] who will teach me English MH and you
[25:08] find out that these subjects are
[25:10] sometime things that frightens you but
[25:12] there's no fear in it if you get a good
[25:15] coach he will Coach you and before you
[25:18] know it you start exploiting this
[25:19] subject they become very easy for you
[25:22] mhm 6 years or eight from that day you
[25:25] become a doctor mhm if you are willing
[25:27] to learn and your father has the money
[25:29] to pay for your school exactly but if
[25:32] your father PID for your school and you
[25:35] went go to school and become a rain gate
[25:38] run around with boys or girls in 6 years
[25:42] you will not graduate exactly and if
[25:45] your father go and bribe the teacher to
[25:50] graduate you for you to begin to kill
[25:53] human being as a doctor is the worst
[25:57] thing he could do to you and to do to
[25:59] his other fellow human being so if you
[26:02] don't agraduate you need to rewrite that
[26:04] class again and there as time it will
[26:08] reach they will expire you from that
[26:10] school if because if you feel you you
[26:12] don't have ability
[26:14] to to to retain what you are learning to
[26:18] put it into practice M so so the choices
[26:22] you make really matter really matter
[26:24] they make you they make you so I told
[26:26] the man I said look
[26:30] there are two smart young people who
[26:32] thought they were very crev and they
[26:34] know
[26:35] everything and in their Village there
[26:37] was an elderly man who is very
[26:40] intelligent highly respected because he
[26:44] can decode anything for you and these
[26:46] two smart smart young man decided we're
[26:49] going to make full out of this man we're
[26:51] going to he think he's smart will show
[26:54] him so they went and got a small B
[26:58] and hid it behind them and get to the
[27:00] Ancient Man and said there is a mystery
[27:03] we want you to decode to us the man said
[27:06] go ahead he said we had a small bed in
[27:10] our back and we want you to tell us
[27:14] whether this bed is alive or dead dead
[27:18] they've already decided if the man said
[27:20] the bed is alive they will squeeze the
[27:23] bed and die die then they will show him
[27:25] a dead bed if the man said the bed is a
[27:28] de he a dead they will show him the bed
[27:30] that he's
[27:31] alive so they met the anent man and said
[27:34] can you please explain I told them I
[27:35] said this is what Destiny is up about
[27:38] can you explain whether this bird is
[27:40] life or dead the ancient man said it's
[27:42] not a problem whether this bird is alive
[27:45] or dead is up to you uhhuh that was the
[27:48] question in other words if you like kill
[27:51] the bird or you like keep it alive the
[27:54] question he gave them he said you want
[27:56] to know whether this bir is alive or
[27:58] dead my answer is that it's up to you
[28:02] it's your choice it's your choice you
[28:04] decide whether you want to keep him
[28:06] alive or kill him so this is what
[28:09] Destiny is all about God had made a
[28:12] provision for every one of us because
[28:17] when he write his vision statement
[28:19] pering human being in Genesis
[28:23] 1:26 he was not under any illusion he
[28:27] said let me make a man mhm in my own
[28:32] likeness after my own kind the way he
[28:36] was is what he wanted to make man mhm so
[28:39] God created a man from beginning to be a
[28:41] Creator MH that's why he didn't even put
[28:45] on that wear for the man when he created
[28:47] him he didn't give him a table he didn't
[28:50] give him a she he didn't give him a
[28:53] cow why because God wanted man to create
[28:57] it to to be part of his creation M he
[29:00] took this table and H it on the
[29:03] tree he took this year kept it on the
[29:07] tree he took automobile keep it on the
[29:11] the team o and the in the mountain the
[29:14] only thing God gave his children which
[29:17] is still what we are fighting for God
[29:21] never gave a man car he didn't give him
[29:23] a shoe mhm he HD it on the cow MH but he
[29:27] gave it sense to be able to get the
[29:29] things out of what is created to be able
[29:31] to recreate the only thing God gave man
[29:34] is land mhm is That's Why They Call
[29:38] property real estate is the only estate
[29:41] that is real yeah that's why that's why
[29:45] they are still fighting in pistan today
[29:47] over land over every problem of the
[29:50] world is land property that is the only
[29:52] thing God gave to his children yeah and
[29:55] I told some of the young believers who
[29:58] once they get the first money the first
[29:59] thing he bought a car the next one is's
[30:01] looking for I said car is not wealth
[30:05] Bible say a righteous man liveth wealth
[30:09] for his children children children if
[30:13] you can't put money in a property and
[30:15] die your child cannot herit your car if
[30:18] you don't have land you have not left
[30:20] any you because if you want to be a
[30:22] righteous man you follow God's principle
[30:24] MH a righteous man liveth weal for his
[30:27] children so the only estate that is real
[30:29] is property so when you start making
[30:32] money invest in property MH so that you
[30:35] can live inheritance for your children
[30:37] don't just buy car buy nice suit and
[30:39] these are not inheritance for anybody so
[30:42] God didn't give a man a cloth but he
[30:45] left the cloth on the wool it's a man's
[30:49] responsibility to think outside of the
[30:51] boss to activate his blame to take the
[30:55] wool and be able to make a clo but the
[30:58] land you cannot make M God gave that to
[31:01] you m but every other thing it is given
[31:04] in your own power to be able to make so
[31:08] let me continue with my
[31:10] story when I grew up as a young man I
[31:13] have an inquisitive mind m i i
[31:18] because so were you at a place when you
[31:20] an alter boy and yes an Al Boy you know
[31:24] God gave
[31:26] us 5 billion cells in our
[31:31] brain average human being use 10% of it
[31:35] if you get to 12% of it you will become
[31:38] a
[31:39] genius there are every that's why
[31:43] William Braham said everything we
[31:46] require to the resurrection is already
[31:49] in us it's not coming it's already there
[31:52] that's right we only need people who can
[31:55] teach us Faith to ATT activate those
[31:58] things and be able to get to our
[32:01] advancement M because my mother had
[32:04] taught me how to
[32:06] pray I heard that Mary visited three
[32:10] children at Fatima they told us this
[32:12] story in Catholic M I went to the bush
[32:16] to pray at the age of seven and I was
[32:20] talking to Mary I said I Le you going to
[32:22] Fatima you can come to n you can come to
[32:25] my Village I want to see you you know P
[32:29] told us about that little child that
[32:33] when the Thunder were um blasing the
[32:37] child was crying and the mother came to
[32:40] the child and said don't worry you know
[32:42] God is with you he said Mom I want god
[32:45] with
[32:46] flesh so I want god with flesh I need I
[32:50] needed I didn't want historical God I
[32:53] wanted to feel God I went to the bush I
[32:56] prayed I didn't see Mary but that didn't
[32:59] stop that hunger of God in Me yeah
[33:02] because if there's a deep calling in
[33:05] your heart there is a deep somewhere to
[33:08] respond for it there's nothing you are
[33:10] taxing for that God has not provided M
[33:15] but the things start from Hunger mhm you
[33:19] can never feed a man a woman who is
[33:23] hungry and you can never teach anybody
[33:25] to be hungry hunger is something that
[33:28] comes naturally naturally so if you
[33:31] don't if somebody is not hungry you are
[33:34] giving him food you are wasting time he
[33:36] had to show that he's hungry and that's
[33:39] how it is so that's why I'm saying
[33:41] everything about us M it's about choices
[33:45] M as I I think um in a message I think
[33:49] it's as I was with Moses B said that 10
[33:51] years from today you can be an asset to
[33:55] the society but 10 years to today you
[33:57] may be cleaning bathroom because of the
[34:00] choices you make today so our choices
[34:03] matters at the end of the day we are
[34:05] some
[34:06] total life never gave me opportunity but
[34:10] I
[34:11] choose that I will be different I choose
[34:14] I will not be like the rest of the other
[34:17] boys I choose I will not go the popular
[34:22] way every other person is going this was
[34:24] my choice MH we were my had us we are
[34:28] three boys and a girl the girl is my
[34:31] senior brother senior me and they had a
[34:34] we had a we are first three boys and
[34:36] then a girl MH but I was different from
[34:39] all of them not because I have better
[34:42] sense of them but I this my
[34:46] inquisitiveness of trying to know was
[34:49] what led me to my Christian fith
[34:53] because I have this desire
[34:57] my mother had had taught me that there
[35:00] is God and when I was 4 years old she
[35:06] looked me into the eyes and told me to
[35:08] believe in myself mhm and to believe in
[35:11] God MH and that I will go places in life
[35:15] and that it would be difficult for
[35:16] people to say no to me
[35:20] MH at that innocent mind I believe
[35:24] everything my mother told me mhm and I I
[35:28] I practice it in my life MH that's why
[35:32] in Genesis the first thing God did to
[35:34] his son is that he blessed them and then
[35:38] after he blessed them he gave them five
[35:42] strategic means to be able to be like
[35:46] him mhm dominate subdue control you know
[35:51] so rule this Earth for him when you
[35:54] apply those
[35:55] principle the there is nothing that
[35:57] could stop you because so there is a a a
[36:01] a a law of success built on every
[36:05] product M once you obey that success you
[36:11] will get the result take for instance
[36:13] I'm speaking with Dynamic phone uh mic
[36:17] okay this mic that I'm speaking has a
[36:21] battery inside yeah so this microphone
[36:25] do not want battery
[36:27] battery it needs
[36:30] battery to be able to function to be
[36:32] able to function so so battery is not a
[36:36] want but if you remove battery from this
[36:40] microphone and you decide to speak in
[36:42] tongue so that you can start speaking
[36:44] you can fast for 40 days days nothing
[36:48] will happen it will not work so you need
[36:51] to obey the law of the manufacturer
[36:53] first of all and the law of manufacturer
[36:56] is to give it battery yeah if you give
[36:59] it battery it will function yeah if you
[37:01] take put battery on it if you like to
[37:03] pray pray that's if you don't like to
[37:05] pray that's up to you but don't do any
[37:08] other thing without giving it battery
[37:10] because battery is a that makes it
[37:14] function so the need for battery is
[37:17] built on it by the manufacturer and so
[37:19] you find a lot of young people they are
[37:21] not willing to do what they they ought
[37:23] to do actually what they advised to do
[37:26] but they think that prayer is going to
[37:28] make it like magical that's that is what
[37:31] religious religion has done to people
[37:35] okay because that's not Christianity
[37:37] yeah Christianity also teach you
[37:41] that uh ecclesiastic 9 whatever you find
[37:45] yourself to do do it with all your might
[37:49] with all your soul with all your ability
[37:52] and that's why our Prophet also taught
[37:55] us yes what whatever you want to do be
[37:58] the best out of it even if you make up
[38:00] your mind to be a criminal be the best
[38:03] criminal not a mediocre don't don't come
[38:06] halfway on it that's that's the attitude
[38:10] so and if you want to be a Christian be
[38:13] a good kind of Christian don't be
[38:15] Halfway Christian you know become an
[38:17] incubator chicken Christian people must
[38:19] follow you up call you every time to
[38:22] come to church chur throw yourself into
[38:24] it yeah amen that's right when BR prayed
[38:30] about his sick situation and was asking
[38:34] God he said
[38:35] God if I die I will come to heaven and I
[38:40] will tell you I trusted you and I died
[38:42] MH so what does that mean he believed
[38:46] God with all his heart with no
[38:49] reservation M
[38:52] so I had it attitude why I why I make
[38:56] this story is that so you can we can go
[38:59] back to the prophet word when John just
[39:02] speak he speak by inspiration yes that
[39:05] is our attitude that bring result
[39:08] exactly but many of us is that we are
[39:11] living in a generation of
[39:14] irresponsibility where people want
[39:19] to um nobody want to accept
[39:21] responsibility people just want to
[39:23] abortion blame transfer responsibility
[39:27] to other people you don't have good
[39:29] reason to explain why they didn't do
[39:32] anything believing that that reason is
[39:35] enough no reason actually people don't
[39:40] know the war the word
[39:43] poor is not about people who lack mhm
[39:47] check your W poor means unproductive MH
[39:53] the word poor is not about people who
[39:55] lack things
[39:56] people that are referred to poor people
[39:59] and people who are not productive when
[40:01] you are not productive then the word
[40:05] poor is refer is is referred to you
[40:08] exactly so God created a man to be a
[40:12] manager mhm God created a man to work MH
[40:17] if you read your Bible Genesis
[40:21] 1 after Genesis 1 to the end then
[40:24] Genesis 2 was application of Genesis 1
[40:27] Genesis 2:4 said the eight was filled
[40:31] with rock no Beauty nothing nothing is
[40:35] functional MH because why there was no
[40:38] human being MH man was the motivation of
[40:41] beauty MH until God created man then
[40:45] water came from the ground then Garden
[40:48] was developed so the first thing God did
[40:51] is he took a man he made him Genesis
[40:53] 2:15 and put him in the garden and said
[40:57] cultivate
[40:58] it dress it make it beautiful protect it
[41:03] m so man was made to walk this is before
[41:08] fall this is before the fall so walk is
[41:11] not a c yeah but many of us do not know
[41:17] the difference between work and a job M
[41:22] because I believe they look like the
[41:24] same but they are not exactly the same
[41:26] yeah M okay your
[41:29] job is what they pay you for what you do
[41:33] M but your work is what you are born to
[41:38] do MH your job can never make you
[41:42] wealthy MH it has limitation in making
[41:45] you wealthy what makes you wealthy is
[41:48] your work MH you go to your job to learn
[41:54] your work mhm when you go to your job in
[41:56] the morning you come back in the evening
[41:59] and start practicing your job your your
[42:02] work M because
[42:06] job in job they pay you salary M salary
[42:11] is a medicine for
[42:14] poverty but it doesn't cure
[42:17] it so is there a connection between work
[42:20] and
[42:21] purpose that is a work is actually
[42:24] purpose exactly work is actually purpose
[42:28] the reason actually you can call it
[42:31] devotion the reason why you were born if
[42:35] you find it that is
[42:38] purpose a natural
[42:41] word even
[42:43] establishments that are purposely driven
[42:46] are much more successful than the ones
[42:49] that are profit driven if you pursue
[42:52] purpose M you will achieve
[42:57] success because when you fulfill purpose
[43:00] this is the reason why you are created
[43:02] and that's why people everybody must not
[43:05] be a doctor everybody must not be a
[43:06] lawyer every if God call you to to to
[43:10] sink just go there and sing like and
[43:15] actually you stop walking when you find
[43:17] your purpose
[43:19] yeah when you operate in your purpose
[43:23] you don't do it with any stress yeah
[43:26] because it's like fish to water yeah yes
[43:30] when fish is swimming it's walking but
[43:33] it's wind doesn't pain him when bed is
[43:37] flying he's walking but his wind also
[43:41] never pain him so when you find your
[43:45] purpose of existence you stop working
[43:49] you is something you love to do and by
[43:52] doing it the result will be so evident
[43:56] because you are in your purpose of life
[43:59] yeah it just comes natural it come
[44:00] natural so when
[44:03] I tried all of those things it was life
[44:08] was rough and hard tough
[44:12] difficult because this was before
[44:14] Nigerian civil war which year are we
[44:16] talking about here we are talking about
[44:18] like 19 uh Nigerian civil war broke
[44:22] out uh I think
[44:25] 196 62 or 63 I'm not very sure but
[44:28] Nigeria had this independent in 1960 it
[44:31] wasn't long soon after that I think by
[44:33] 65 or the the the civil war broke out
[44:36] okay and I was still a young man you
[44:39] know little boy uh you know you it's
[44:43] something you don't wish for anybody to
[44:44] see where you see jet fighter come
[44:47] dropping bomb in people's house we run
[44:50] under the bunker people could not go to
[44:53] farm to fish we have to it's about
[44:55] survival we at every anything that is
[44:57] moving to be able to to leave but I have
[45:01] sheer
[45:02] determination that if there's one person
[45:05] that will be alive and survive so it's
[45:08] all about determination we made in
[45:10] ourself that's why when I teach
[45:13] principle I tell people the first thing
[45:15] you need to bring on the table with God
[45:17] is desire MH you must have desire
[45:20] mhm because your desire is like your egg
[45:24] mhm the jam the seed come from God but
[45:28] that seed will not fall on
[45:31] anything if a woman make love with her
[45:35] husband if she doesn't drop egg she can
[45:37] make love as many time as possible
[45:39] nothing thing will germinate those egg
[45:41] will die so the egg has to be there for
[45:44] the seed to come into it and you see
[45:46] life is created so that desire will be
[45:49] there so and that's why Jesus in Mark
[45:54] 11:24 say whatever you
[46:00] desire you believe you receive it and
[46:04] you will have it so desire it come
[46:09] first then the the promise come on it so
[46:13] you need to have that and that desire is
[46:16] what I call hunger and we have a we have
[46:19] an issue here uh I've seen it myself and
[46:21] many have actually even told to me
[46:23] directly when young people desire things
[46:27] let's say big things or they want to
[46:29] achieve certain things in life our
[46:31] society you know we just people would
[46:33] take will talk words to you they say
[46:35] well you're over ambitious you're overly
[46:37] ambitious you're proud you know instead
[46:40] of encouraging and many young people
[46:42] just then just stay back and you know
[46:45] and leave everything to Fed okay so that
[46:48] is the um that is um very important uh
[46:53] point you have made there but I would
[46:54] like us to
[46:56] balance it and what do I mean by I want
[46:59] us to balance it the reality is that the
[47:02] way God want us to live even though we
[47:05] are adult is to live like little
[47:10] children a little child do not know
[47:14] fear God want us to live a Fearless
[47:20] life we are not born with
[47:23] fear we learn fear fear is something we
[47:26] learn as we grow
[47:27] up if you find a
[47:30] child in his innocent
[47:35] level and I I actually tell
[47:38] parents today I teach people if you
[47:41] really want to know naturally who your
[47:44] child is wash him from the age of two to
[47:50] five if that child is a born
[47:53] Chef he will go to the sand I'm putting
[47:56] sand together to make like he's cooking
[47:58] if he's a
[48:00] born um doctor you will see him taking
[48:03] something putting in Pur because what he
[48:07] is is manifesting naturally because
[48:10] that's what he was born to
[48:12] be by the time he's getting to the age
[48:15] of8 or nine his father is a lawyer his
[48:19] father said go to school and learn law
[48:22] you can make money from law all these
[48:24] things doesn't make money
[48:26] then the boy the father decided to live
[48:29] his life through his own
[48:34] child the boy will go and learn law
[48:38] law but he will never win any case in
[48:40] the
[48:43] court because anytime they say something
[48:46] he's looking for
[48:48] book he never get inspiration nothing
[48:50] speak back to him only
[48:53] book he s forc him to become a a doctor
[48:56] because his father is a doctor because
[48:58] you're a doctor your son must be a
[48:59] doctor it doesn't work like that yeah
[49:02] you fish can never climb a tree
[49:06] yeah are you feel what I'm saying yes so
[49:09] allow the children to grow naturally
[49:12] parents many time are dream Killers we
[49:15] parents kill the dreams of our children
[49:19] but the truth also is that if you many
[49:22] time it's a diff a it's really a
[49:26] difficult thing to explain but I told
[49:29] people problem many times is opportunity
[49:32] in life because the word crisis in
[49:36] Chinese language actually means
[49:39] opportunity when you talk about crisis
[49:42] in China m not
[49:45] like in the direct interpretation of
[49:48] crisis in China is opportunity okay you
[49:52] can Google it aming you can Google it so
[49:56] anything you think is an obstacle m is
[50:00] an opportunity
[50:02] mhm if my father is
[50:06] alive I did not believe my father could
[50:10] have allowed me to do some of the things
[50:12] I did MH at my te age that brought me to
[50:17] where I am M so my father's death
[50:22] supposed to be a
[50:23] hindrance but I turned it into
[50:26] opportunity opportunity I knew there are
[50:29] things my children wanted to do that I
[50:31] stopped them my last boy wanted to drive
[50:35] motorbike I said please stop that you
[50:38] break your leg you you cannot do that
[50:40] what stop stop but I drove motorbike at
[50:43] the age of 11 I was not 12 when I drove
[50:47] motorbike yeah my only son who drive
[50:51] motorbike out of my four boy is the one
[50:54] who disobeyed me
[50:55] [Laughter]
[51:00] are you get are you get what is yes but
[51:03] today both of us go out to go and ride
[51:06] bike and you enjoy together yeah we we
[51:10] I'm a biker I have BMW 1,600 so he has
[51:13] Suzuki uh 1,300 we go out now and rode
[51:17] bike and we are the only two people that
[51:19] rode bike in my family but he's able to
[51:22] ride back by disobedient
[51:25] many time you will never find Road
[51:28] without missing road yeah that's
[51:31] right if you keep on following a road
[51:34] that has been taught to you you will not
[51:36] discover new road that's right so you
[51:40] need sometime you need to miss road
[51:43] yeah you may get to the end and you find
[51:46] out there's no Road there you come back
[51:48] it's experience yeah you've gained
[51:51] experience and people ask me why do you
[51:52] say this thing don't you know this thing
[51:54] will confuse young people I said life is
[51:56] not about what all that you are taught
[52:00] you must have inspiration
[52:03] mhm if my father was alive he would
[52:06] never allow me to marry under 20 years H
[52:11] because it's it's not in our tradition
[52:13] so I break tradition for you to do
[52:16] something new you break tradition
[52:20] mhm William
[52:22] Braham did not force himself to see he
[52:26] was born a SE
[52:28] mhm and his brethren in Baptist Church
[52:32] said this is
[52:33] devil you can't what do you say you see
[52:37] because we don't see here what do you
[52:39] say you are seeing we don't believe any
[52:40] such thing you don't believe such thing
[52:42] stop
[52:43] it and he kned down start praying God I
[52:45] don't want evil spirit please take this
[52:47] away from me but the gift and calling of
[52:49] God is without repentance so he couldn't
[52:52] do anything about it so if you are I'm
[52:55] too guided micromanaging people you
[52:59] don't get to see the people fully
[53:01] actualize themselves so sometime we must
[53:03] also allow our young people to make
[53:06] their mistakes because that's part of
[53:08] learning nobody get up one day and say
[53:11] I'm working the way to get to work is
[53:14] you fall how many times no what your
[53:17] daddy is interested is that you are
[53:19] making a to stand up it's not counting
[53:21] you have fall first you have fall the
[53:23] second one you have fall at the thir
[53:25] time no what you are seeing is that that
[53:26] baby is making every effort to cor you
[53:29] never challenge him why did he fall
[53:32] provided he keep on making effort to get
[53:34] up one day his leg will become strong
[53:37] yeah but any baby that were born he said
[53:39] I'm going to sit here I don't want
[53:41] anybody to laugh at me the day my leg is
[53:44] strong I get up to walk he will become a
[53:47] a l person will never walk yeah the
[53:50] process of walking is buil in in rising
[53:53] and falling yeah so people who are so
[53:56] conscious of making mistake never amount
[53:59] to anything in life that's right that's
[54:01] very powerful yeah the prophet supported
[54:04] it he said anybody who do not want have
[54:09] IR Reser the man said I want to work for
[54:11] you but he said why you said don't make
[54:13] mistake but said that person you you
[54:15] don't need him because you will be too
[54:18] careful mhm you will never dare anything
[54:21] in life
[54:23] yeah the correct thing is to have desire
[54:26] to be right your desire was not be to
[54:29] make a mistake but will you make a
[54:31] mistake you must make a mistake that
[54:34] because that's how you learn the
[54:36] development and processes of learning
[54:39] come from mistake M so if you go one way
[54:43] and find that there's no Road there you
[54:45] won't go there again but if you want to
[54:48] be very careful so when that child is
[54:50] growing
[54:51] up the child is so
[54:54] innocent he believes in anything is
[54:57] possible he has no
[55:00] fear if you have a little socket here he
[55:03] will put his hand
[55:05] inside you say it's childish yes it's
[55:07] childish but that is fear that that is
[55:10] that is expression of Freedom how God
[55:13] want us to live if you if a if a serpent
[55:15] is here he doesn't know serpent he go he
[55:18] grab the
[55:19] serpent and St it into his mouth if you
[55:22] leave the baby you have no erter here
[55:25] he's clamming this tap before this boy
[55:28] will
[55:29] follow the angel of God is guiding that
[55:32] child yeah it's not you God has a
[55:36] protection if parents see the things
[55:39] their children did when they were trying
[55:40] to you see the child start to walk it's
[55:42] going like Bree is blowing him you know
[55:45] you almost break his head but through
[55:47] all of those things his leg start
[55:49] getting strong at that tenter age the
[55:53] boy said that buy me something when you
[55:55] are coming back he said what do you want
[55:57] I want a plane the boy said that will
[56:01] buy me a plane he go to his friend and
[56:04] said Daddy is buying me a plane tomorrow
[56:06] I'll show you he go to the person buy
[56:09] got and if the daddy came come
[56:12] back he will go and ask his daddy
[56:14] where's my Aeroplane you know why asking
[56:16] because he believe that his daddy will
[56:19] buy him a plane yeah Jesus said we
[56:22] should be like those children many of us
[56:24] don't believe God and we never go back
[56:27] to go and ask we don't pray with
[56:30] sincerity because we because only expect
[56:33] if you are looking for anything you have
[56:35] to be under expectation yeah that's
[56:36] right and brother BR say you will never
[56:38] live above your confession confession
[56:40] when you believe things you begin to
[56:42] confess
[56:43] it people say many things about me
[56:47] before I have
[56:49] $1,000 before I knew what $500 was on my
[56:53] honor I told people I would with the US
[56:55] dollar millionaire H and people were
[56:57] laughing at
[56:58] me we are too
[57:01] conscious what what happen if I say this
[57:04] thing and it doesn't happen what happen
[57:07] if I say it it doesn't happen because we
[57:10] our s ego is cheating us because we
[57:14] don't want to be laughed at they want we
[57:17] want to be look like we're very
[57:18] responsible but that's where we expose
[57:21] oursel in our
[57:23] foolishness to trust c
[57:26] means I've told them yesterday some
[57:28] people ask me is your head correct I
[57:31] told them I don't know about my head I
[57:33] know about my heart my heart is correct
[57:36] what my head I don't know about it but I
[57:39] meant well my desire is correct that I
[57:42] know because I never desire to do
[57:44] anything wrong wrong yeah can I do wrong
[57:46] yes I can because I'm human being yeah
[57:49] but it's not in my desire to do wrong
[57:51] that's right so I'm not I don't worry
[57:53] about my head I worry about my my heart
[57:55] it's what my heart is telling me is what
[57:58] is matter to me but in my head I can
[58:00] make mistake and that's why you you need
[58:03] to watch me over a period of the time
[58:07] and see how I'm threat telling to know
[58:11] whether I'm consistent in the things I'm
[58:13] doing then you know truly whether you
[58:16] can bet on this person or you can trust
[58:18] this person so that way those little
[58:21] children live is the way we're supposed
[58:23] to live
[58:25] and that's why the prophet said don't
[58:27] promise your child something you will
[58:29] not do
[58:31] because the children will think this is
[58:34] how God is that he make empty promises
[58:37] so he wanted us to learn in teaching
[58:40] children because that innocent heart
[58:42] those children have is what we are
[58:44] supposed to have and that is how we are
[58:46] supposed to live in life to be under
[58:49] expectation that whatever God promised
[58:51] us will happen and then we walk towards
[58:54] it
[58:55] now at certain age your dad will said
[58:59] I'm going to buy you
[59:01] Aeroplane but before I come back I want
[59:03] to make sure you have finished your
[59:04] homework mhm you see engagement has
[59:07] become he's teaching that child now how
[59:10] to take responsibility yes now you will
[59:13] not expect that you will not do your
[59:15] homework and expect me to give you the
[59:16] rlan is that correct because when God
[59:20] took the children of Israel he gave
[59:23] their their true never wore out yeah in
[59:27] the wilderness yeah their cloth never
[59:29] wore out they have breakfast they have
[59:32] dinner and God tell them I have a place
[59:35] I'm taking you Kenna Promised Land M
[59:38] where there is honey where there is this
[59:43] once they enter
[59:45] Canan man
[59:47] hased God said this is the time for
[59:49] management M no free food m h this is
[59:54] it's time for management yeah take your
[59:57] sword
[59:59] War Drive out all these Anarchist in
[1:00:03] your mountains oh the people said is
[1:00:06] this one chance uh promise we thought
[1:00:08] when we enter here everything is already
[1:00:11] done for us we pick them on the street
[1:00:13] the land is Flowing with milk and honey
[1:00:15] honey but that is the training so
[1:00:18] withness was was was God what God does
[1:00:22] for you in real life there are a
[1:00:24] situation where of
[1:00:27] Independence independency where you are
[1:00:29] depending on people to do everything to
[1:00:32] you there are about three or four faces
[1:00:34] of your life you get to the point now
[1:00:37] where nobody makes decisions for you you
[1:00:39] begin to make that decision so that's
[1:00:41] people need to grow and follow that
[1:00:43] process because that's how God put
[1:00:45] everything in life so if we follow that
[1:00:49] God guarantee he built in every one of
[1:00:52] us success M but that success will come
[1:00:56] by obedience let me give you one final
[1:00:59] analogy then we go to another
[1:01:02] point the man that makes this
[1:01:07] phone buil success on this phone
[1:01:11] M but he didn't give you this phone
[1:01:14] without
[1:01:16] manual when you buy
[1:01:20] phone you see a
[1:01:22] packet before you get to the phone there
[1:01:25] are about three or four books one is a
[1:01:29] diagram which is image you will see
[1:01:32] first the second thing is a book called
[1:01:35] warranty the third thing is a manual
[1:01:38] they hit this phone before you reach to
[1:01:40] the phone they have expected you to have
[1:01:42] gone through all of those things before
[1:01:44] you pick phone before you open it up if
[1:01:46] you have gone through all of them by the
[1:01:48] time you have this phone you know how to
[1:01:52] command this phone to deliver to you the
[1:01:56] success the man built on the phone MH do
[1:02:00] you know that I've carried this Apple
[1:02:01] phone for years I didn't know I can be
[1:02:05] speaking and this phone will be typing
[1:02:08] the things that I'm saying because I
[1:02:10] didn't read the man read the manual what
[1:02:12] I knew is that this phone can I can
[1:02:15] receive call and they can send call I
[1:02:17] can receive email I was in I was in
[1:02:21] tunisha last last year I was doing
[1:02:23] something with the man said what is this
[1:02:25] you are doing I said I'm trying to send
[1:02:27] me to the children said you are taking
[1:02:28] too much time he said can I have your
[1:02:30] phone I open my phone he play something
[1:02:32] okay say what you are saying I said
[1:02:33] Junior I've been trying to reach you
[1:02:35] this my
[1:02:36] phone started tying I scream put
[1:02:40] my by the time I say you finish I said
[1:02:42] send I press button the thing go I said
[1:02:45] is this what my children are doing
[1:02:47] before I finish sending the mail they
[1:02:49] they and I'm wondering how they doing
[1:02:51] this thing so the next time now my son
[1:02:54] had just sent mail I play the I said
[1:02:55] junior thank you very much I understand
[1:02:57] the things you said God bless you P the
[1:02:59] thing don't go this phone can recognize
[1:03:02] your voice and type not
[1:03:05] voicemail typing but I've carried this
[1:03:07] phone for 15 years I didn't have never
[1:03:10] used that function because you did not
[1:03:12] read the because I did not read the
[1:03:14] manual and I couldn't make the command
[1:03:17] on the phone the phone has the potential
[1:03:20] the ability MH but I need to command the
[1:03:23] phone mhm so even in the New Age we are
[1:03:26] going into the AI age mhm what is most
[1:03:31] important today MH in artificial
[1:03:33] intelligence MH the colc colum in school
[1:03:37] has to change because you need if you
[1:03:39] don't ask the right question MH that
[1:03:42] human machine will not give you the
[1:03:44] right correct answer mhm you must know
[1:03:47] the right command by answering the right
[1:03:50] question for it to respond to you
[1:03:52] appropriately so the manual for life is
[1:03:57] Bible the word of God many of us don't
[1:04:00] read it and we want to result and that's
[1:04:02] why we never get result and that's a big
[1:04:05] problem most of the unbelievers that are
[1:04:07] successful follow laws that are in the
[1:04:11] Bible they don't give credit to God they
[1:04:14] said the universe the universe said this
[1:04:16] they said they call it Universe they
[1:04:18] give it any other name so you don't tag
[1:04:20] them religion all those principle they
[1:04:22] have used to survive back the origin of
[1:04:25] it is from the word of God yeah but they
[1:04:27] don't give credit to God they call it
[1:04:30] universe so that they don't call them F
[1:04:32] religious Fanatics yes when they want to
[1:04:35] talk about Jesus they tell you the wise
[1:04:37] man they don't say
[1:04:39] Jesus certainly the wise man give Talent
[1:04:43] he would say Jesus so that people don't
[1:04:45] quarrel them yeah they are ashamed but
[1:04:48] they take those principles and they use
[1:04:50] them apply them they they apply them and
[1:04:52] get result so one of the things that
[1:04:55] helped
[1:04:56] me is that I became a Christian very
[1:04:59] early in my life and I think that's what
[1:05:02] set me apart from my contemporaries MH
[1:05:06] before I turned 15 I made a commitment
[1:05:08] to Christ M and I read Bible back to
[1:05:11] back I follow every principle that I
[1:05:15] find in the word of God and I apply them
[1:05:17] in my life and people look at me like
[1:05:22] I'm a and that I'm a ex extraordinary
[1:05:24] I'm ordinary person like every one of
[1:05:27] them because I am not the person that
[1:05:29] brings result if you
[1:05:31] follow Jesus in Matthew chapter 16 say I
[1:05:34] will give you the keys m not one key
[1:05:38] plural Keys of the Kingdom of
[1:05:41] [Music]
[1:05:44] God you guys are located in area of
[1:05:47] hotel if somebody give you the bunch of
[1:05:49] the keys of this place and don't show
[1:05:52] you the very key for this door you can
[1:05:54] there in this door for 2 hours yeah
[1:05:56] looking for the right key even you have
[1:05:58] the key sometime you app it you me small
[1:06:01] resistance you remove it and you are
[1:06:02] going around the circle but the man that
[1:06:04] knows the key just turned the key around
[1:06:07] he took the right key he put it if the
[1:06:10] if he push it a little bit the door open
[1:06:13] and you ask yourself is it the same key
[1:06:14] that I'm using that this man Ed he
[1:06:17] applied it with confidence because you
[1:06:18] know this is the right key by the time
[1:06:21] you are figing with the key so it makes
[1:06:23] you feel like this person is
[1:06:25] extraordinary no he's not because it's
[1:06:28] the keys that are opening the door so
[1:06:32] the keys are in the word of God for
[1:06:34] everything we do many of us want
[1:06:37] Prosperity M but we do not know the key
[1:06:41] for Prosperity is not only prayer mhm
[1:06:44] and many of us fast for 40 days 40 night
[1:06:47] doing nothing praying mhm nothing will
[1:06:50] happen M if you do not take a step of
[1:06:53] faith
[1:06:54] exactly God asks Moses what is that
[1:06:58] thing that is in your hand mhm you need
[1:07:01] to follow this principle
[1:07:03] because a
[1:07:05] seed have a law built in a seed
[1:07:09] mhm if you put a seed on this table if
[1:07:13] it's not hybrid seed it's an in
[1:07:16] seed the life that is in that seed is
[1:07:22] Perpetual but he need the condition to
[1:07:25] function if you leave it on this table
[1:07:28] you speak in tongue you pray you fast
[1:07:32] nothing will happen nothing happens but
[1:07:35] if you follow the law and get a a land
[1:07:39] where there is
[1:07:40] must where there is
[1:07:42] sun and you prepare the ground you put
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:46] seed if you like pray if you don't like
[1:07:50] don't pray that seed will grow exactly
[1:07:54] because the law that is in the seed
[1:07:56] become effective when you get to the
[1:07:58] ground but if you take the same seed and
[1:08:01] get hot sand and put it inside the hot
[1:08:04] sand you circumvent the life that is in
[1:08:07] the seed it will not grow because you
[1:08:09] did not follow the law so obedience to
[1:08:12] law guarantees success
[1:08:15] success so then you have taken us on the
[1:08:19] on your journey and of course you did
[1:08:21] speak about uh what your mother did and
[1:08:25] her contribution towards that uh but
[1:08:28] then again you've been talking about
[1:08:30] life choices and and the choices really
[1:08:33] make make us what we will become in the
[1:08:35] future and one of the most important
[1:08:37] choices you've made that you've been
[1:08:39] speaking of for the past few minutes is
[1:08:41] that you decided to be a Christian
[1:08:43] that's correct and that uh this can we
[1:08:46] then say that this has been the basis of
[1:08:50] what you are today
[1:08:52] absolutely I was 15 living like I am
[1:08:56] 1550 I was 14 living 140 Christianity
[1:09:00] gets you to level of
[1:09:03] maturity beyond your contemporary
[1:09:06] because the word of God opens to you you
[1:09:09] see your full potentials you see all
[1:09:13] that is
[1:09:15] possible because if you make that
[1:09:17] decision yourself but if you follow your
[1:09:19] daddy to church you don't that doesn't
[1:09:23] mean you a
[1:09:24] because you've not made a commitment I'm
[1:09:26] talking about you making a commitment
[1:09:28] and decision that I'm following Christ
[1:09:32] it become your own choice that even your
[1:09:35] father say I don't follow anymore you
[1:09:37] you don't follow your father you now
[1:09:39] follow so because St John 1 verse 12
[1:09:44] said as many as receive Christ are given
[1:09:47] power to become the children of God
[1:09:51] which were born not after the will of
[1:09:53] man man not after the will of Flesh this
[1:09:55] born the the born your father or mother
[1:09:58] born you has been cancelled you are now
[1:10:01] regenerated you have a new father and
[1:10:04] you begin to live for him at that point
[1:10:07] if your natural father said this thing
[1:10:09] doesn't make sense you say God bless you
[1:10:11] but because it makes sense to me and so
[1:10:14] then you had many friends who were your
[1:10:15] age at the time but then because you of
[1:10:18] the decision you had taken to follow
[1:10:20] Jesus Christ it rearranged everything
[1:10:22] that you were doing started doing it
[1:10:24] different because when you become a
[1:10:25] Christian the first thing it does to you
[1:10:28] is it gives you Vision yeah vision is an
[1:10:32] Insight yeah you can be in this room
[1:10:35] four corner wall but you can see beyond
[1:10:38] this room Yeah by your by your eye mind
[1:10:44] yeah your inner mind it's not just your
[1:10:46] physical side that controls you anymore
[1:10:49] yeah so that
[1:10:51] Vision create a picture in your mind of
[1:10:55] your destination yeah it's a journey of
[1:10:58] a voyage yeah you may not know all the
[1:11:00] route that will take you there but the
[1:11:03] end of it you must see it yeah because
[1:11:05] that will be the motivation that makes
[1:11:06] you wake up every morning Christian
[1:11:08] gives you Vision this is where I am
[1:11:10] going and that thing drives you in
[1:11:14] everything you do yeah
[1:11:16] so and that tender age before I turned
[1:11:20] 15 nobody told me to do that but I've
[1:11:23] learned Prin disciples from the word of
[1:11:25] God habakuk 220 if you have a vision
[1:11:28] write it down
[1:11:30] yeah don't just say it's a vision many
[1:11:34] people tell you they have a vision ask
[1:11:36] them what is the vision they don't
[1:11:39] know did you see Jesus Christ asking
[1:11:43] people what would you that I do for
[1:11:47] you even a blind man he ask him the
[1:11:51] question the BL man would have said are
[1:11:53] you blind
[1:11:56] also but it's
[1:11:58] assumption you may think a blind man
[1:12:01] want to see it's assumption for some
[1:12:03] people it's a virtue yeah it's
[1:12:04] opportunity to beg yeah that is their
[1:12:07] [Laughter]
[1:12:09] business not all of them are blind as we
[1:12:12] suppose they
[1:12:13] are even the ones that are really blind
[1:12:16] there are some of them who think this
[1:12:19] has God gave me this
[1:12:22] to be with who I am they are content
[1:12:25] with it because that's a source of
[1:12:28] income yeah so Jesus will ask the blind
[1:12:30] man what will you that I do for you then
[1:12:34] the blind man said that I might receive
[1:12:37] my sight and Jesus said your eyes open
[1:12:41] he never Force anything on anybody yeah
[1:12:44] so he asks you that's why I'm talking
[1:12:46] about desire yeah you must desire that
[1:12:50] thing you desire is what God will do for
[1:12:54] you because you bring your desire under
[1:12:57] subjection to his will but so when you
[1:13:01] have
[1:13:03] Vision which is plan write it
[1:13:07] down so I was 15 when I wrote five
[1:13:11] things I want to accomplish before
[1:13:13] 25 Yeah by 18 I want to live in three
[1:13:17] bedrooms apartment of my own number one
[1:13:20] by 20 I want to take a lady to altar a
[1:13:23] wife get married number two by 21 I want
[1:13:26] to have a son not a child a son I wrote
[1:13:29] a song by 23 I want to have my UNC
[1:13:32] number four my 25 I want to be a mirian
[1:13:35] wow I didn't just I wrote them down
[1:13:40] wrote it in a boat and put it in the
[1:13:42] wall of my
[1:13:45] bed so in the morning I go out when I
[1:13:49] come back I come back here after I pray
[1:13:52] I look at this from beginning to the end
[1:13:55] internalize it into my system then I go
[1:13:58] to my bed I
[1:14:00] sleep when I'm sleeping I'm dreaming
[1:14:03] about those things because these are the
[1:14:05] things that dominate my spirit Romans
[1:14:08] chapter 6 said know you not that to whom
[1:14:10] you y yourself servant to oby his
[1:14:12] servant you are whether of sin unto
[1:14:14] death or obedience unto righteousness
[1:14:17] yeah in the morning I pray after I pray
[1:14:20] before I step out I go back there I look
[1:14:23] at all of those five things so when I am
[1:14:26] walking in the street you are talking to
[1:14:27] me you don't know the way my head is
[1:14:29] walking MH I'm listening to you looking
[1:14:33] at you and what my head is telling me is
[1:14:36] there anything this guy can offer me is
[1:14:39] there a way he can help me reach this
[1:14:41] place if there is no if I see from
[1:14:44] everything you are doing you cannot
[1:14:45] support this dream I cut you off yeah
[1:14:49] because you are a distraction you chose
[1:14:52] the people you relate with you have a
[1:14:53] vision you choose your friends yeah you
[1:14:56] don't even get to the Bookshop and
[1:14:58] looking for book to before you get to
[1:15:00] the book you know exactly the book
[1:15:02] because you are looking for everything
[1:15:04] that support yeah that thing where you
[1:15:06] are going that's why vision is the first
[1:15:10] thing that happen in the life of people
[1:15:13] for them to get the result MH when you
[1:15:16] write your vision then you write your
[1:15:17] mission yeah how to be able to so this
[1:15:20] thing was my driving force people
[1:15:23] criticize me people say I'm too proud
[1:15:25] some people say I'm too arrogant people
[1:15:27] qualify me with all kind of
[1:15:30] qualification I know I have a good heart
[1:15:34] but I have a purpose something is
[1:15:35] driving me that I want to accomplish and
[1:15:38] I didn't want a distraction MH if you're
[1:15:41] a young girl and I'm moving with you you
[1:15:43] ask me for sex I cut you off because un
[1:15:45] wanted child cannot take me to this
[1:15:48] place so I was possessed almost like a
[1:15:51] mad person because this is where I'm
[1:15:53] going and each year I can come back and
[1:15:56] ask myself where am I to where I want to
[1:15:59] be this is part of the reason of writing
[1:16:01] this down because it drives you it help
[1:16:04] you hold yourself accountable every year
[1:16:08] and see what have I done to move me from
[1:16:12] point A to
[1:16:13] B you know this thing is so serious that
[1:16:16] some people don't understand
[1:16:19] it by 18 years I was living in three
[1:16:21] bedrooms apartment of my own my senior
[1:16:23] brother is still living with my mother
[1:16:25] MH I left home I had my own house
[1:16:28] because I have
[1:16:31] plans by
[1:16:33] 19 18 I started talking to a girl in
[1:16:38] church to marry mhm and I took her to
[1:16:42] alar on September 23rd 1978 I would turn
[1:16:46] 20 on December 24th that year I beat it
[1:16:49] with by four months I was married at 19
[1:16:52] years years plus
[1:16:54] MH of course I made love to my wife
[1:16:57] expecting a baby in 21 because that's
[1:17:00] what I expect to have but God knew that
[1:17:02] these two baby cannot be making baby
[1:17:04] shut the wom so that they can get their
[1:17:05] ass together I pursue my other dream
[1:17:09] yeah I wanted a car by 23 I got it at 22
[1:17:13] yes I wanted to be a millioner by 25 I
[1:17:17] got it by 24 I made my first $2 million
[1:17:21] at 24 years not naira not naira dollars
[1:17:25] dollars at 24 24 years huh 24 years yes
[1:17:30] till today where I am living that is my
[1:17:34] home that I still live is a house I
[1:17:37] built when I was 25 years there is a
[1:17:40] part that you left out and I know that
[1:17:42] it might impact some people here uh that
[1:17:45] are listening to us uh you got the 400
[1:17:48] your first income I'll come I'll come
[1:17:50] back to it that's that's really my that
[1:17:52] that's I'll come back to it I didn't
[1:17:54] forget it but I'm I'm building the story
[1:17:56] because that was my beginning because of
[1:18:00] the death of my father my mother
[1:18:02] couldn't support me he was supporting my
[1:18:04] senior brother so I went to live with
[1:18:07] his parents my grandparents mhm so I
[1:18:11] learn industrial I became industrious at
[1:18:13] very tender age of my life
[1:18:17] mhm before I turned 8 years I already
[1:18:20] start criming pal Tre h yes my life is
[1:18:24] way out of this word that you think you
[1:18:26] can make a movie out of it and it is
[1:18:29] comparing and it will sell anywhere in
[1:18:31] the world so I became a braid winner
[1:18:34] before when you see some of the small
[1:18:37] children haing in the street you said
[1:18:39] their parents abused them I used to be
[1:18:41] one of them but if that is what abuse is
[1:18:45] all about all of us should be abused but
[1:18:49] that was a training point for me because
[1:18:52] my my mother had convinced me that I'm a
[1:18:55] likable person and that I can go places
[1:18:58] and nobody can say no to me don't worry
[1:19:01] one of the things you require in life to
[1:19:04] succeed is confidence that actually
[1:19:07] there are three DS that you must not
[1:19:09] miss in your life
[1:19:11] MH desire is Number One MH decision to
[1:19:16] pursue your desire is number two
[1:19:19] determination to go through all the OD
[1:19:23] that will stop you yeah three DS mhm the
[1:19:26] liation of these three DS are three
[1:19:29] other things you need to do MH one is
[1:19:33] Vision second is Faith to Believe in
[1:19:36] Your Vision mhm third is courage to act
[1:19:40] in Your Vision courage is not an absence
[1:19:44] of fear It's ability to act in the face
[1:19:47] of danger and that means if I perish I
[1:19:50] perish but this is where I'm going I
[1:19:53] have sense of direction so because there
[1:19:55] are things that are going to come and
[1:19:57] challenge you anything you believe has
[1:20:00] to be subjected to test yeah for citizen
[1:20:03] mhm it is at that testing point that
[1:20:06] many people give up they think this test
[1:20:09] is to destroy you no this test is to
[1:20:11] make your root to get more deeper on the
[1:20:14] ground MH like the prophet told us when
[1:20:17] the breeze come is not to T of the tree
[1:20:19] that was when it checks the ground for
[1:20:21] it to get de rooted so all those Trials
[1:20:25] Come is not is to adversity is nothing
[1:20:29] in our life but a refining fire that
[1:20:33] burns out impurities in our life that's
[1:20:36] why job said when I am try I shall come
[1:20:39] forth like gold purify it so trials will
[1:20:42] come your way things will shake you up
[1:20:45] but these are school this life is school
[1:20:50] many times people tell me I am not
[1:20:52] educated but I told them I went through
[1:20:54] the School of Life yeah and I graduated
[1:20:58] with distinction yeah and if you don't
[1:21:01] believe I am educated you cannot call
[1:21:04] with my result yeah because they ask
[1:21:07] Henley Ford who is educated man the man
[1:21:11] that buil for mobile he said educated
[1:21:13] man or a woman is a person who organizes
[1:21:18] thought into productivity H if you can
[1:21:22] organize your thought organize your
[1:21:24] thoughts into productivity into
[1:21:25] productivity you educated but there are
[1:21:28] many intellectuals with PhD M but they
[1:21:33] cannot organize that thought to be
[1:21:36] productive but they can speak good
[1:21:38] grammar but they have no substance to
[1:21:41] substate that grammar but they speak
[1:21:44] impecable English but this impecable
[1:21:47] cannot put water on the cannot refine
[1:21:50] water and put it in a bottle what is of
[1:21:53] that English at the end of the day you
[1:21:55] find out that many core entrepreneurs
[1:21:59] and people who drop out of college I
[1:22:01] don't know whether there's anything
[1:22:02] assciated with it whether it is B
[1:22:04] whether it's so many other people they
[1:22:06] because school is trying to hinder them
[1:22:09] they ahead of school
[1:22:13] yeah that's right school is pulling them
[1:22:15] back they ahead of school after they
[1:22:17] make money they go back to school yeah
[1:22:19] because they they have something that
[1:22:22] makes them wake up every day that they
[1:22:25] want to accomplish and that that is the
[1:22:28] internal motivation God put in every
[1:22:31] human being yeah every one of us have a
[1:22:35] a a nature a depth of God in us yeah
[1:22:38] calling for it is called Deep that call
[1:22:41] after a deep that's right but are you
[1:22:43] willing to respond to that call and that
[1:22:46] willing to respond to the call is to
[1:22:48] show the hunger that this is who you
[1:22:51] want to show up
[1:22:53] the if that hunger is in you God is
[1:22:55] there to be able to uh bless that hunger
[1:22:58] and make it happen I worked for my uncle
[1:23:01] for 5 and a half years MH almost 6 years
[1:23:05] that's our system where I H from we EO
[1:23:08] people we call it apprenticeship M at
[1:23:11] what age was that I was about seven when
[1:23:15] I joined him mhm um because um uh um I
[1:23:21] should be a a about 8 I should be about
[1:23:24] 8 because uh that was why when he
[1:23:28] settled me I was 14 years plus so I
[1:23:30] should be either s and a half years when
[1:23:33] when when I join him and I work for him
[1:23:35] for 5 years 5 years plus usually in our
[1:23:38] custom mhm after the time of
[1:23:42] apprenticeship your uncle will give you
[1:23:44] some
[1:23:46] Capital but before give you Capital he
[1:23:48] has to pay for a shop for you it's part
[1:23:51] of the thing he said to you in fact that
[1:23:53] he will locate a place pay for one year
[1:23:55] rent or two years rent give you some
[1:23:58] merchandise and then give you some
[1:24:00] capital
[1:24:02] okay um this is what I expected that's a
[1:24:05] common practice among common practice
[1:24:07] but there's nothing contractual nothing
[1:24:09] is written anywhere okay and it is it
[1:24:11] didn't say it must be this amount it
[1:24:13] depends on the ability of your boss how
[1:24:16] wealthy he is on because both of you are
[1:24:19] supposed to work together to to build
[1:24:21] something for him to
[1:24:23] and I worked very hard while I was
[1:24:26] working for my uncle we started in Legos
[1:24:29] where his men shop start we made
[1:24:32] progress he open a branch in J I managed
[1:24:35] his branch in J from J he opened a
[1:24:37] branch in sokoto I managed the branch in
[1:24:39] Soo from Soo it brought me to Legos I
[1:24:42] was managing the third branch at okay at
[1:24:45] the age of 15 when I became a Christian
[1:24:50] okay um when I became a Christian before
[1:24:53] the age of
[1:24:54] 15 we have camp meeting where we go for
[1:24:58] fasting and prayer
[1:25:00] mhm the truth is that there's something
[1:25:03] wrong in the generation we have today
[1:25:06] compared to the my own generation mhm
[1:25:09] before I turned 15 I could stay without
[1:25:13] food for 3
[1:25:15] days we go for camping meeting fasting
[1:25:18] and prayer it was in this camping
[1:25:21] meeting that we are on the second day
[1:25:24] and my boss came looking for me and
[1:25:27] understood I have lock up his shop and I
[1:25:30] was in church
[1:25:32] fasting people from my area business is
[1:25:36] religion we don't play with our
[1:25:40] business and my boss could not
[1:25:43] understand on a Monday morning working
[1:25:45] day I I was in church praying he was a
[1:25:49] Catholic and I used to be a Catholic for
[1:25:52] him this is this is
[1:25:53] fanaticism yeah so he he he sent for me
[1:25:57] they came to call me that he wanted to
[1:25:59] see me that evening and I should come
[1:26:01] with my senior
[1:26:02] brother and I went to see him he asked
[1:26:05] me where have I been I told him I went
[1:26:07] to church and we have a prayer meeting
[1:26:10] and we are
[1:26:12] fasting he
[1:26:14] said fasting he told me what do I repeat
[1:26:18] the word again I said we're fasting he
[1:26:20] said I'm starving you didn't have money
[1:26:23] to eat I said no we are fasting I'm
[1:26:25] praying for the business to grow so that
[1:26:28] we can make more progress yeah it's okay
[1:26:32] he counted 200 naira and gave me so I
[1:26:36] asked him what is it for he said that is
[1:26:38] my settlement so I can go back to church
[1:26:41] and
[1:26:43] fast it was like a
[1:26:46] punishment so I went with my senior
[1:26:48] brother so I said I said Uncle I don't
[1:26:53] understand if you have decided to settle
[1:26:55] me there is a custom you need to get me
[1:26:58] a store put merchandise do I buy one
[1:27:01] carton of plug we are not selling bread
[1:27:03] to put it in my head and H it and say
[1:27:06] buy plug oh I said this has never done
[1:27:09] so whatever I want to do I should do
[1:27:11] with it but he doesn't want me to come
[1:27:15] to a shop from tomorrow I should go face
[1:27:18] My
[1:27:19] Religion you know the word of God gives
[1:27:22] you confidence yeah I've learned Bal
[1:27:25] principle like I said I was 15 living
[1:27:28] like I was 15 it was my mother's Junior
[1:27:31] brother quite senior to me but I look
[1:27:34] him eyeball to eyeball because one of
[1:27:37] the things the word of God does to you
[1:27:38] if you live right is that he give you
[1:27:40] confidence yeah that's
[1:27:42] right yeah because you actually you
[1:27:45] become Fearless yeah obedience to law
[1:27:50] make you Fearless h
[1:27:53] I never stole his money I have nothing
[1:27:56] to fear I looked him straight into the
[1:27:58] eye I said
[1:28:00] Uncle I asked you again what do you want
[1:28:02] me to do with this 200 na I said I told
[1:28:05] you whatever you like to do with it you
[1:28:08] do I said
[1:28:10] Uncle are you listening to me 5 years
[1:28:14] from today you can make a note if you
[1:28:17] had who I am your head will be spinning
[1:28:20] you shook him there are something you
[1:28:22] don't expect 15 years boy to say when I
[1:28:25] said that he move on he said he said
[1:28:27] well I don't care I know you will be
[1:28:29] successful I said thank
[1:28:31] you that's what I wanted to hear I
[1:28:33] wanted to hear that blessing from him he
[1:28:35] said I know you be I said thank
[1:28:38] you my senior brother got angry he said
[1:28:41] leave that thing let us go I turn I said
[1:28:43] did you have anyone to give me when we
[1:28:45] get home he says no because I've also
[1:28:48] learned the principle in the word of God
[1:28:50] do not negr the beginning of a small
[1:28:53] thing yeah amen because that's also
[1:28:56] where many Christians make mistake weize
[1:28:58] things and say this it's not what that
[1:29:00] thing is it's what that thing can be in
[1:29:02] the hand of God that's right it's not
[1:29:05] who you are yeah it's what if that thing
[1:29:08] come to the hand two fishes and five
[1:29:11] rows of bread fed
[1:29:13] 5,000 when God's Dynamic power come into
[1:29:17] that thing so it's not what that thing
[1:29:18] is but what it can be in the hand of God
[1:29:21] of God yeah
[1:29:23] so I said if you don't have any why are
[1:29:24] you asking me to leave this one but I've
[1:29:27] told my Uncle to watch what happened
[1:29:29] when we went back so I team up with my
[1:29:32] senior brother we form a company called
[1:29:34] Mica Brothers M within 3 months we
[1:29:37] differ in
[1:29:39] ideology if if I next time you can read
[1:29:42] my book there's a book written on me my
[1:29:44] biography written by ambassad from the
[1:29:47] the what created the problem between me
[1:29:50] and my senior brother was that if I'm
[1:29:52] going to church I take one naira it's
[1:29:54] like $2 $188 for offering my brother
[1:29:57] told me you cannot be taking one naira
[1:29:59] in our business money for
[1:30:01] offering that in Catholic we give 10 C
[1:30:04] one1 of that I said P you drink beer I
[1:30:08] drank coke the offering I gave
[1:30:10] compensate for the beer you drink he say
[1:30:12] he's not ready for my Logic Let us part
[1:30:15] and we parted where God's word call for
[1:30:17] total separation from every unbelief
[1:30:19] amen from every unbelief from every
[1:30:21] unbelief that's how we part it's in the
[1:30:23] book and my he confirmed it this is true
[1:30:26] on this principle we parted well but you
[1:30:29] see if you follow principle you will
[1:30:32] never go wrong
[1:30:35] yeah prayer alone cannot make you
[1:30:37] Welling you need to learn the principle
[1:30:40] of giving yeah you also need to
[1:30:42] principle of praying you also need the
[1:30:44] principle of hard work exactly all of
[1:30:46] this need to come together
[1:30:48] mhm it's like it's like a car
[1:30:52] your engine alone cannot move your car
[1:30:54] but say mechanics without Dynamics is no
[1:30:57] good neither Dynamics without mechanics
[1:30:59] need to come together need to come
[1:31:01] together yeah he say if you take all the
[1:31:03] boat and not in the car you haven't
[1:31:06] gotten nothing but a junk MH the engine
[1:31:09] is there the body is there but if the n
[1:31:12] and screws are not there you'll have a
[1:31:14] junk because it can't move it cannot
[1:31:16] move so you need to bring all this
[1:31:19] component together then you get whole
[1:31:22] thing so this Keys all has to come
[1:31:25] together for things to do but we take
[1:31:27] one and run with it and left the others
[1:31:30] and then we keep on worrying that the
[1:31:32] other things are not happening every
[1:31:34] other thing has to come you cannot do
[1:31:36] prayer alone morning you pray oh till
[1:31:38] evening and play play and then he said
[1:31:41] somebody say I throw money you expect a
[1:31:46] lotac money I've been praying opening
[1:31:49] cupboard I haven't seen money I learn
[1:31:52] you walk for money God ask Moses what is
[1:31:55] that is in your hand is the thing that
[1:31:57] is in your hand that God can take and
[1:32:01] take and Jesus said what do they have
[1:32:03] said two fishes he said bring it yeah
[1:32:06] then the dynamic power come on it for
[1:32:09] you know atomic energy come on it for
[1:32:11] multiplication yeah so you can't come
[1:32:14] with
[1:32:15] nothing in future I will give you a
[1:32:19] testimony how God turn
[1:32:23] 2 billion NAA worth of an investment in
[1:32:26] one
[1:32:28] day to become 14 billion Nair in one day
[1:32:32] 24 hour one day in 24 hours but there's
[1:32:35] going to be something for him to turn
[1:32:37] around
[1:32:39] nothing I've seen it I've seen things
[1:32:41] happen but you got to do something you
[1:32:44] got to start somewhere so and so when
[1:32:47] you separated with your brother I
[1:32:49] separated from my brother and then how
[1:32:51] did you start up and then I somebody a
[1:32:53] friend of mine gave me um one quarter of
[1:32:57] his store something like between where
[1:32:59] you are staying in there and ask me to
[1:33:01] keep my merchandise for 6 months because
[1:33:03] I I didn't even have Capital to pay for
[1:33:06] a shop you know so and I kept the my
[1:33:09] goods here work hard you know struggle
[1:33:13] you know everything I know the first
[1:33:15] money I got I bought a hor speaker for
[1:33:18] my morning evangelism that was my first
[1:33:20] EV that was my my first investment yeah
[1:33:23] I've been on this road for a long time
[1:33:25] and I've been consistent by the grace of
[1:33:27] God yeah people look at me some of them
[1:33:29] laugh and say Jesus the millionaire
[1:33:32] because I keep on telling them I will be
[1:33:33] millionaire but they use it as a mocker
[1:33:35] to me but they call me the name anyhow
[1:33:38] but there's something about them as they
[1:33:40] calling me they are they they are
[1:33:41] multiplying they bringing progress on it
[1:33:44] and ultimately they live many of them
[1:33:47] live today to see all of the things I
[1:33:49] told them to become a reality it wasn't
[1:33:52] because I am more intelligent to than
[1:33:56] them it wasn't because I work harder
[1:33:58] than because many of them work harder
[1:33:59] than me yeah but God blesses that effort
[1:34:03] that we put yeah but you can't stay and
[1:34:06] say God will bless you without making
[1:34:08] any effort you got to go there give your
[1:34:11] best there and let me tell you many
[1:34:15] people I don't agree with definition
[1:34:17] many of us have for
[1:34:19] success success is not be another person
[1:34:22] in the game mhm success is doing what
[1:34:25] you are giving bir to do yeah so if I'm
[1:34:28] not doing exactly what God gave me back
[1:34:31] to do I can be doing better than brother
[1:34:34] a or brother B but I'm still not
[1:34:36] successful is when you are you are
[1:34:39] operating in your gift mhm that's when
[1:34:42] you can say you are successful exactly
[1:34:44] because he give Talent one 2 3
[1:34:49] 4 the prerogative
[1:34:52] of that number of talent is is depending
[1:34:56] on God yeah but one other thing I
[1:34:59] believe is that God only give you based
[1:35:02] on your ability to manage and that's
[1:35:05] another problem that many people when
[1:35:06] they see someone being successful in one
[1:35:09] area they want to do that exact thing
[1:35:11] and um many of them also feel like oh uh
[1:35:15] the other one is going ahead of me I
[1:35:16] need to do what they are doing so I can
[1:35:18] be successful like they are and they
[1:35:20] don't believe in the and what they can
[1:35:22] be able to accomplish sure we all can
[1:35:25] never do one thing you just got to find
[1:35:28] that because when we were small children
[1:35:31] we used to go to Mango
[1:35:33] three even with some ant on it biting us
[1:35:37] what attract Us in that mango tree it's
[1:35:39] not the it's not the trong it's not the
[1:35:40] leaf it's the fruit yeah when you supply
[1:35:44] your gift to people mhm
[1:35:48] then the reward they give you for that
[1:35:51] that gift you give them is success is
[1:35:53] money so you need to look for service
[1:35:56] Gap you need to look for opportunity
[1:35:58] success is like opportunity for service
[1:36:02] when you see where there are problem if
[1:36:06] you solve that problem money is the
[1:36:09] reward that comes to you so your your
[1:36:13] motive and driving forces can I find
[1:36:16] problem I can provide solution so you
[1:36:18] keep on thinking when you see problem
[1:36:20] don't run away from the problem because
[1:36:22] that problem is your opportunity yeah to
[1:36:25] become successful yeah but people say no
[1:36:27] no this thing is difficult no this thing
[1:36:29] is difficult if you are running away
[1:36:30] from difficult thing then how do you
[1:36:32] become successful it's difficult things
[1:36:34] that you you provide solution now bate
[1:36:38] used to work for IBM
[1:36:41] okay big gate got an idea of a of a
[1:36:46] software mhm and going to the management
[1:36:50] board and tell them I saw a laptop on
[1:36:54] every table they say in some table
[1:36:56] because IBM idea about computer is some
[1:37:00] big thing that is look like big door
[1:37:03] here they didn't believe in all of this
[1:37:06] and the fire bate you cannot fire a man
[1:37:09] with a gift because his gift goes with
[1:37:11] him yeah that's right and he go and
[1:37:14] develop software today all
[1:37:17] IBM things have biget product on it and
[1:37:21] brigate become bigger than IBM so you
[1:37:25] know if you have your
[1:37:27] gift nobody can fire you m because they
[1:37:31] didn't put the gift in you that's right
[1:37:33] n gift goes with you but you go to work
[1:37:37] for somebody to learn to develop and
[1:37:40] refine that your gift yeah but you
[1:37:43] create wealth when you operate in your
[1:37:45] gift when that gift become functional
[1:37:48] and being functional because of the
[1:37:50] product you supply app to people in
[1:37:52] Africa God said in his word in Genesis
[1:37:57] multiply the word
[1:38:00] seed was first mentioned in Genesis
[1:38:04] 1:1 if you follow the principle of first
[1:38:07] mentioning
[1:38:09] M the seed SE is not about making baby
[1:38:13] but there's African concept about seed
[1:38:16] of making baby
[1:38:18] mhm Bible say everything whose seed is
[1:38:22] in it will bring forth after his own
[1:38:24] kind MH that thing you have is
[1:38:27] somebody's seed somebody's brain sh this
[1:38:31] thing I have is somebody's seed
[1:38:32] somebody's brain child that's right this
[1:38:34] is somebody's seed yeah somebody's brain
[1:38:37] sh the thing is inside okay so for you
[1:38:40] to understand this the father of all of
[1:38:44] this is Apple yeah so each of them he
[1:38:48] born he give him the last name his
[1:38:49] father's name Apple then this one is
[1:38:52] Apple 7 this is his first name this one
[1:38:54] is Apple 12 there's Apple 15 as his
[1:38:57] borning children it's giving now the
[1:39:00] owner of this is Living in America but
[1:39:01] his children is around the whole world
[1:39:03] bringing money to him so we need to ask
[1:39:06] our where is our brain child yeah
[1:39:10] because God gave us a child in our brain
[1:39:14] to born when you provide that solution
[1:39:17] when you find problem you will solve to
[1:39:20] the world
[1:39:21] the reward that comes to you is money MH
[1:39:24] so and we see people
[1:39:28] creating things different apps different
[1:39:31] things when you Pro when you see when
[1:39:34] what you need to do any day you wake up
[1:39:36] is can I find a problem I can solve for
[1:39:38] people yeah a manager is not a somebody
[1:39:42] who identify this is problem this is
[1:39:44] problem no we didn't call you to come
[1:39:45] and show us problem because we know
[1:39:47] there's problem we call you to come and
[1:39:49] help us provide solution Sol that's
[1:39:52] where you become valuable to us
[1:39:56] yes when Joseph went to
[1:40:00] Egypt and provided solution for food
[1:40:06] crisis and wrote his own job
[1:40:09] manual and tell fellow look for somebody
[1:40:12] who will do this for you fellow said who
[1:40:14] is better person to do this job than
[1:40:18] yourself you go take the job
[1:40:21] and Joseph became a prime minister yeah
[1:40:24] but fellow
[1:40:26] knew that this knowledge did not come
[1:40:29] from University of Egypt yeah this culum
[1:40:33] University of Egypt don't have it what
[1:40:35] God does for you God don't give you cash
[1:40:37] he gives you knowledge he gives you
[1:40:39] information he gives you idea that idea
[1:40:42] create wealth this idea gives you money
[1:40:46] MH but you must show
[1:40:48] up by telling God I am hungry yes I I
[1:40:53] believe I was not born for nothing and
[1:40:56] let me tell you young people that are
[1:40:59] listening to me no human being that is
[1:41:05] Ungifted even with a person with
[1:41:07] impediment of sight there's a gift in
[1:41:11] him that he need to offer the word
[1:41:13] exactly once you find that gift you find
[1:41:16] your wealth yeah and uh maybe I'll just
[1:41:20] speak to the viewers for just a few
[1:41:23] moments uh that uh what we are listening
[1:41:26] I can say personally have uh been
[1:41:29] listening to a lot of speeches by Dr
[1:41:32] kosmas is a fountain of wisdom when it
[1:41:35] comes to uh you know principles
[1:41:39] Christian principles and being able to
[1:41:41] uh to make the money and and being able
[1:41:43] to serve God and become successful and
[1:41:47] the things you are hearing I know in the
[1:41:49] next few moments we'll ask you to say
[1:41:50] send in your questions maybe some I've
[1:41:52] already sent we'll check it out and uh
[1:41:55] since there are very many people so we
[1:41:56] will not take all the questions but uh
[1:41:59] we'll see how we go on time uh but
[1:42:02] there's this thing that I wanted to talk
[1:42:04] about uh that I wanted you to
[1:42:07] address uh today we have a mass Exodus
[1:42:11] of people from East Africa and many
[1:42:13] African countries as a whole you know
[1:42:15] people going for greener pastures to
[1:42:17] Arab Nations here in Uganda one of our
[1:42:19] biggest exports
[1:42:21] is the is the people going the girls
[1:42:23] especially going to Arab countries to
[1:42:25] work as housemid and things like that
[1:42:27] and others go to Europe and other
[1:42:29] countries so the reason is they say we
[1:42:32] can't make it here it's dry it's you
[1:42:34] know we are poor Africa is poor but yet
[1:42:37] you made all the money uh I mean the
[1:42:39] last I checked was uh uh you know you
[1:42:43] were one of the top most richest men in
[1:42:45] Africa and you made all your money here
[1:42:48] in Africa not in you know living in
[1:42:51] Europe but here part of the testimony
[1:42:53] that you said you said that some people
[1:42:56] wanted you to stay in in in Europe or
[1:42:57] was it in the USA but you couldn't stay
[1:42:59] there okay so the question is what would
[1:43:02] you advise these young
[1:43:05] people that's where mindset is
[1:43:10] important what did I say mindset the way
[1:43:14] you think MH nothing is as important as
[1:43:18] the way you think mhm
[1:43:21] I actually somehow believe that somebody
[1:43:25] never die until the person accept to die
[1:43:28] when you take the last
[1:43:31] bread I've seen people accident happen
[1:43:34] their legs are caught and the doctors
[1:43:37] have checked with every scientific means
[1:43:40] why the person will not leave and the
[1:43:42] person is alive and some people say it's
[1:43:44] a wish it's a state of
[1:43:47] mind you need you are never defeated
[1:43:50] until they give up
[1:43:55] so let me say clearly from Bible
[1:44:01] perspective
[1:44:02] that Migra migration did not start today
[1:44:07] M it's as origin as the Bible MH but
[1:44:11] what I tell people to
[1:44:13] do is to be sure you had from God that
[1:44:18] God is telling you before you migrate
[1:44:21] location okay because we have read in
[1:44:24] the Bible we've seen people who left
[1:44:27] full and came empty-handed back in the
[1:44:31] case of Nomi yeah we've seen the angel
[1:44:34] tell Joseph take this child and mother
[1:44:37] migrate to Egypt migration has always
[1:44:40] been there all the time from IM
[1:44:44] Memorial but if God asks you to
[1:44:47] go you will never have regret but if you
[1:44:51] go by yourself without hearing from God
[1:44:55] you may be selling yourself to slavery
[1:44:58] yeah at the end of the
[1:45:00] day and you come back empty I have
[1:45:02] opportunity myself to go to America the
[1:45:06] first time in my life about over 40
[1:45:09] years ago 19180
[1:45:11] M and everybody did everything to talk
[1:45:15] me to stay back in America mhm so when
[1:45:20] people are talking about Exodus it's not
[1:45:22] today people have been running away in
[1:45:25] the'80s was it not hard for you then to
[1:45:27] get the visa it was hard it was
[1:45:30] difficult in fact we're talking about
[1:45:31] which year 1960 70 19 19 1980 80 80 I
[1:45:36] think I went to 1979 was my first time
[1:45:39] 79 79 was my first time to
[1:45:43] us um it was difficult but like like I
[1:45:46] said I I've always been a man of Faith
[1:45:49] who believe because when I went to
[1:45:51] American Embassy the first ever overseas
[1:45:54] trip I made and the guy that interviewed
[1:45:57] me look at me I was a young man he said
[1:46:00] young man I'm afraid I'm not going to
[1:46:02] give you
[1:46:04] Visa I laughed I look at the man I said
[1:46:07] what is scaring you you give you give me
[1:46:09] Vis I go to America and come back to
[1:46:11] Nigeria I'm sure nobody have asked him
[1:46:13] that kind of question I left US Embassy
[1:46:16] with 5 years Visa first time I ever went
[1:46:19] to Embassy and I went to us and I meant
[1:46:20] to come back and I came back and he came
[1:46:22] back yeah people try to convince me to
[1:46:25] stay back that I'm not educated and I
[1:46:28] can get a scholarship I go to school
[1:46:31] those days America was much better yeah
[1:46:34] once you I came to I have um what do you
[1:46:37] call Social Security I just came back
[1:46:39] and I register and the Social Security
[1:46:41] then doesn't say valid for work or not
[1:46:44] valid for work so if you have social
[1:46:46] security you can have driving license
[1:46:48] you already integrated in the system
[1:46:50] because anywhere you going to work what
[1:46:52] they ask is your Social Security and you
[1:46:54] would have given a social security that
[1:46:56] have uh you could have given a driver's
[1:47:00] license I have social security nobody
[1:47:02] asks you are you an alien once you have
[1:47:04] it you are already in the system I have
[1:47:06] them but I decided to go back to Nigeria
[1:47:11] MH I am a proud African say that again I
[1:47:15] am a proud Nigerian yeah and I rent from
[1:47:19] William Bram message yes to be a true
[1:47:22] America you have to be identified yeah
[1:47:25] you share in her shame and her glory
[1:47:27] glory whatever she is is what you are
[1:47:32] yeah I'm so proud of my
[1:47:35] country that I want to prove to people
[1:47:38] that we are not just an idiots yes and
[1:47:41] that so dust is not in our brain yes
[1:47:43] there's nothing a white man
[1:47:46] had that make him Superior than me m we
[1:47:51] all have common sense yeah nothing like
[1:47:54] a spirit nothing nothing it's because I
[1:47:56] am born in Africa where there is hor son
[1:47:59] that make my skin dark that doesn't make
[1:48:02] me inferior to anybody yes I my mother
[1:48:06] help me to build this self-confidence M
[1:48:11] actually if you want to
[1:48:14] start war with me is when you think you
[1:48:17] are better than me then we draw a line
[1:48:22] before then I respect you we are
[1:48:24] colleagues but any day you begin to talk
[1:48:26] to me and talk me down like like I am a
[1:48:30] black man from Africa therefore my head
[1:48:32] is not correct then we draw a line I'll
[1:48:34] tell you you don't nobody gives you that
[1:48:37] Authority yeah that's right I never feel
[1:48:40] in in to any fellow human being no
[1:48:42] matter who you are yeah even even you
[1:48:44] are Donald Trump I'll talk because what
[1:48:47] is that I have the Holy Spirit who what
[1:48:48] did you have yeah
[1:48:51] I have confidence in my Christian faith
[1:48:53] exactly that I never look down I respect
[1:48:56] people but I so much believe on the
[1:49:00] power of God in my life
[1:49:02] so if you treat me fairly I respect you
[1:49:07] I believe all men are born equal equal
[1:49:11] so amen that's my belief so I deal with
[1:49:14] you I don't once you are come I don't
[1:49:17] look at your skin and my body begin to
[1:49:19] change no anything at all I'll tell you
[1:49:21] I will employ you and I have quite a
[1:49:23] number of them working for
[1:49:26] me he has a lot of white people working
[1:49:28] for him so it's not about rest yeah no
[1:49:31] okay so what that does is that um when
[1:49:35] the the um uh
[1:49:38] um when um we got to that
[1:49:41] situation um um um I went to America
[1:49:46] they did everything to me to stay back I
[1:49:49] remember in the airp Port one lady
[1:49:51] asking me what is my
[1:49:53] frustration I told him I visited here I
[1:49:56] didn't come here to
[1:49:58] stay I'm I'm going back to
[1:50:02] Nigeria they couldn't understand it and
[1:50:04] I went back to
[1:50:06] Nigeria let me tell you Africa is where
[1:50:10] opportunity for development is that's
[1:50:13] right the growth of the world is going
[1:50:15] to come from Africa you can still
[1:50:18] register a construction company today in
[1:50:21] in in Uganda and become one of the
[1:50:23] biggest construction company that it is
[1:50:25] because Africa is still a bush it's a
[1:50:30] place to organize yeah if you go to
[1:50:32] Japan if you go to America growth level
[1:50:36] is very poor the only thing is that they
[1:50:38] have a system that is balanced that if
[1:50:41] you succeed it can give you a repo but
[1:50:45] they are actually living for maintenance
[1:50:48] but they are not living for development
[1:50:51] maintain old building maintain this
[1:50:53] maintenance everything has already been
[1:50:55] built but here it's a forest it's a dark
[1:50:59] world we can create things so you can go
[1:51:02] into Agriculture and create a wealth
[1:51:04] that people will never believe you can
[1:51:07] go into mining there are people here
[1:51:10] don't see the opportunity why is Chinese
[1:51:13] all running to come to Africa why are
[1:51:16] they doing everything to come for Africa
[1:51:19] while us Aman people are running away
[1:51:21] and tell you this place is useless I
[1:51:23] tell young people in Nigeria the things
[1:51:26] you cost never bless you mhm don't say
[1:51:30] this place is useless mhm because you
[1:51:33] are taken to captivity by the words of
[1:51:35] your mouth useless thing canot become
[1:51:37] useful to you because you already
[1:51:39] condemn it you need to believe that if
[1:51:43] God kept me here there is reason why God
[1:51:46] kept me here and I'm going to make the
[1:51:48] difference in this place where I am
[1:51:51] where I am and because opportunity is
[1:51:54] here yeah you only need to see there are
[1:51:57] many people who can look but they cannot
[1:51:59] see but there are very few eyes that can
[1:52:02] that can see so if God can open your
[1:52:05] eyes and you see the opportunities here
[1:52:08] then you see the reason why they are all
[1:52:10] doing everything to come here because
[1:52:12] that's where the the opportunity for
[1:52:15] growth is okay so I saw that and I
[1:52:20] decided to come
[1:52:21] back I came
[1:52:24] back to
[1:52:26] Nigeria it's not like I was a rich man
[1:52:29] MH I didn't have $200,000 at this time
[1:52:32] so you can say I am
[1:52:34] comfortable I do not but I believe
[1:52:37] there's opportunity for me here to make
[1:52:40] it in Africa M and through to it all the
[1:52:44] people that advis me not to come back to
[1:52:47] Nigeria the only way they are better
[1:52:50] than me is that they have
[1:52:53] 24 uninterruptable power supply because
[1:52:56] I also have it that when take their own
[1:52:59] I put my generator so they have
[1:53:02] uninterruptable that's why I said not
[1:53:04] that they have more because I say I
[1:53:06] start the time they interrupt me I put
[1:53:08] my generator so I have power supply also
[1:53:11] but my own is interrupted the own is
[1:53:14] interrupt is interrupted yeah the second
[1:53:16] thing is because of that they are refug
[1:53:19] to have a bottle of milk and orange
[1:53:21] juice on it 24 hours which I may not be
[1:53:24] able to keep because sometime the light
[1:53:26] goes off so other than that there's no
[1:53:29] way they are better than myself yeah and
[1:53:32] I made it in Africa yeah changing a
[1:53:35] location does not change you that's a
[1:53:38] good point yeah you change a location
[1:53:40] but you have not changed yeah when
[1:53:43] Adam disobeyed God God came down and
[1:53:47] said Adam Adam where are thou
[1:53:50] is it that God do not see God cannot
[1:53:54] know where Adam is no God is asking Adam
[1:53:57] are you out of position yeah he's not
[1:53:59] asking him about location it's about
[1:54:01] disposition yeah are you out of order
[1:54:04] yeah I knew where I place you you
[1:54:07] mismanage your home yeah and Adam was
[1:54:10] replying God I saw you and I saw I was
[1:54:13] naked and was closing myself as if God
[1:54:15] didn't know you are naked when you he
[1:54:17] you saw already what happened but it's
[1:54:19] not about location is about disposition
[1:54:21] so many people change location but
[1:54:24] nothing has changed and that's why you
[1:54:26] see some of them living in her blood
[1:54:28] they still working in a f attendant
[1:54:31] because if you don't know the secret for
[1:54:32] Success changing a location does not
[1:54:35] change you does not change you so I
[1:54:37] think you would agree with me if if we
[1:54:39] say that uh this generation needs a
[1:54:41] mindset change mindset I started with
[1:54:45] you that it's a mindset it's a mindset
[1:54:47] shift yeah that this place is not that
[1:54:51] useless yeah and the opportunities is
[1:54:54] here to make it yeah but you need to
[1:54:56] dear life yeah you need to stop being
[1:54:59] afraid for nothing yeah and dear life
[1:55:02] yeah and that what it means is that
[1:55:04] that's why I encourage young people I
[1:55:06] said the time to make mistake is between
[1:55:10] 15 and 2528 yeah go if you need to break
[1:55:14] your leg break your leg if you break
[1:55:16] your leg it will heal again yeah don't
[1:55:18] go and break your leg when you are 60
[1:55:20] years because it will be difficult to
[1:55:22] heal if you break your r at 18 or 17 3
[1:55:25] months you are you are working again
[1:55:27] yeah there
[1:55:28] are years you are given in life that
[1:55:32] early stage of Life brother Braham said
[1:55:36] 86% of successful people made it between
[1:55:39] age of 15 and 28 yeah even statistic
[1:55:42] prove it including salvation yeah many
[1:55:45] people that stay through are people who
[1:55:47] are sa at 14 15 16 16 17 when you get to
[1:55:51] 30 40 you already being molded do they
[1:55:55] make it at 60 70 say yes they did but
[1:55:58] like in pyramid is very rare small the
[1:56:02] base is on the on the
[1:56:04] bottom so the time to really de life
[1:56:08] yeah to have conversation with yourself
[1:56:11] is that critical age of tender age you
[1:56:14] are more bended if you want to Som
[1:56:16] assault try to Som assault before 20
[1:56:19] don't Le to some assault at 28 because
[1:56:21] you have spinal col iny yeah you will be
[1:56:23] on a wish year so speaking on on mindset
[1:56:26] change and of course you spoke about
[1:56:28] Christianity and how it changed your
[1:56:30] mind and you know to set you apart to be
[1:56:32] different from your peers uh then that
[1:56:35] brings another question is does being a
[1:56:37] Christian or and more so a message
[1:56:39] believer put one to an advantage of
[1:56:42] prosperity or success
[1:56:44] absolutely
[1:56:45] absolutely because you
[1:56:48] know when we talk about success of
[1:56:51] people have really don't get the correct
[1:56:54] concept of success frankly I do I am one
[1:56:57] person do not do not believe that money
[1:56:59] is Success what's your definition of
[1:57:01] success my definition of success is um
[1:57:05] my defition of success is um success is
[1:57:11] pursuing a what a while goal that's why
[1:57:15] I say life is about purposeful ding m
[1:57:19] reaching a goal or a destination does
[1:57:22] not make you successful yeah money does
[1:57:25] not mean you are successful because
[1:57:27] Bible say the prosperity of a fool will
[1:57:30] destroy him yeah as a matter of fact if
[1:57:32] you're a Christian yeah if you don't
[1:57:35] have a solid foundation yeah and have
[1:57:38] the baptism of the Holy
[1:57:40] Spirit money is the fastest way that can
[1:57:43] take you to hell yeah because you can
[1:57:45] Finance your sin and use your money to
[1:57:47] jam a lag in anybody mouth that ever
[1:57:50] question you yeah because Bible say
[1:57:52] money open it every door yeah so there
[1:57:56] are many people who are wealthy that I
[1:57:59] had no regard or respect for
[1:58:02] yeah I'm not picking on CH PRI CH PRI
[1:58:06] now is a king of England because he was
[1:58:10] born into a loyer family he doesn't need
[1:58:12] to work whatever he has was provided for
[1:58:16] him I would rather go to de
[1:58:20] lunch with a young boy that lost his
[1:58:22] father at the age of four and walk
[1:58:25] himself through college and be able to
[1:58:26] put food on the table because he has
[1:58:28] something to show for it you you can
[1:58:30] inherit wealth it doesn't make you
[1:58:32] successful what did you contribute to it
[1:58:35] to that so you need to work hard that
[1:58:39] shows your
[1:58:40] Ingenuity bring out that gift God if
[1:58:43] you're doing something your mother tell
[1:58:45] you to do and everything is provided for
[1:58:47] you that doesn't make you successful so
[1:58:49] success is pursuing a worthwhile goal
[1:58:53] that God gave to you it's not about
[1:58:56] destination you reach that's why beauty
[1:58:58] is not success power is not self success
[1:59:02] if you want to talk about it a of
[1:59:03] Nigeria has power your former president
[1:59:05] IND mean has power Alexander the Great
[1:59:08] has power yeah but then at
[1:59:12] 33 H okay so those things doesn't make
[1:59:16] you wealthy yeah so we want to you what
[1:59:21] actually how do we know how successful
[1:59:23] you
[1:59:24] are is we want to see how you impact
[1:59:29] nature life life is about impartation
[1:59:33] William Braham say my life will be worth
[1:59:35] living yeah when I can touch somebody in
[1:59:38] a positive way yeah life is not about
[1:59:41] duration it's about donation how long
[1:59:44] you live has no meaning if you go to
[1:59:47] look at your Bible we say
[1:59:50] said mem Liv 965 years and they died
[1:59:54] that's the only thing that we said about
[1:59:56] him Jesus died at 33 we can never stop
[1:59:59] talking about him Peter died most you
[2:00:02] because that's why where many of us make
[2:00:03] mistake you know God promise me 70 life
[2:00:07] is not duration it's about donation
[2:00:09] exactly most of the Apostles none of
[2:00:11] them live 70 yeah did you impact your
[2:00:16] generation how do we call you a leader
[2:00:18] is what happened after you left yeah if
[2:00:22] what you stood for all fell in your
[2:00:25] presence after you are there you are not
[2:00:26] you have not imparted
[2:00:28] anybody Jesus set up a
[2:00:32] company that we call
[2:00:34] Christianity at a tender age MH died
[2:00:38] 2,000 years ago his company is growing
[2:00:41] getting more client every day and I'm
[2:00:44] one of his client now people are
[2:00:46] subscribing to him people are
[2:00:47] subscribing to his IND every day yeah
[2:00:51] that's why grobal 500 compan studying
[2:00:54] the secret of this man servant
[2:00:57] leadership that 2,000 years ago after he
[2:01:01] died M he has over two billion client
[2:01:04] and this his and his compan is still
[2:01:07] growing every day yeah it become they
[2:01:11] want to build the company that will last
[2:01:15] like that they are now studing his son
[2:01:19] leadership quality that Mak him this
[2:01:22] successful MH because when you get
[2:01:25] people committed to your organization in
[2:01:27] that way then you stop working then
[2:01:29] everything will be able to do so so his
[2:01:33] quality of
[2:01:34] leadership was found in his exit because
[2:01:38] he built the foundation of it so success
[2:01:41] is not about making money your dollar in
[2:01:44] your bank account and all about that how
[2:01:46] many people do you impart what's sense
[2:01:49] of direction do you give people what
[2:01:51] problem did you solve for Humanity yeah
[2:01:54] that you can be remembered for how did
[2:01:57] you impact people in a very positive
[2:02:02] way I consider myself a successful
[2:02:04] person M and one of the my mindset of
[2:02:09] this is that life never gave me
[2:02:11] opportunity for anything
[2:02:15] yes I wasn't I didn't have any
[2:02:19] certificate of any form because I
[2:02:21] stopped in a third grade
[2:02:24] education but I believe in God's giving
[2:02:28] common
[2:02:29] sense and the I challenge status quote
[2:02:32] from the things that I was brought up
[2:02:35] from I went through school of life when
[2:02:39] I was doing apprenticeship for my
[2:02:44] uncle I could look around and I see some
[2:02:47] of these things that are being done can
[2:02:49] be done better many of us hear this word
[2:02:53] Innovation we think we must go to
[2:02:55] university to be Innovative Innovation
[2:02:58] is doing things in a different way
[2:03:01] finding a better way to do things to get
[2:03:05] a maximum result which is part of the
[2:03:07] things God said dominate this eight be
[2:03:10] in control of it yeah so I begin to say
[2:03:13] this thing my uncle is doing you know he
[2:03:15] can be done better so the problem I have
[2:03:19] with apprenticeship is that it
[2:03:20] micromanage you it doesn't give you
[2:03:22] opportunity to exhibit your Ingenuity so
[2:03:26] everybody must tell you this is what you
[2:03:27] need to do so when my uncle settled me
[2:03:31] my
[2:03:31] excitement was not on 200 na my
[2:03:34] excitement is that oh
[2:03:37] finally I can do with my life what I
[2:03:40] want to do I have the freedom I can now
[2:03:42] paint the picture on the board of my
[2:03:45] life where what I wanted and I started
[2:03:48] painting those picture so it excit me
[2:03:52] that I'm not under anybody's tutorage
[2:03:55] anymore but I have my total freedom Amen
[2:03:59] to Define my future and my destiny and
[2:04:03] from that day I begin to say this is
[2:04:05] where I'm going to be this is where is
[2:04:07] going to happen and so and and let let
[2:04:09] me finish this story you know I I told
[2:04:11] the story yesterday in
[2:04:14] church because when you are Dam even by
[2:04:19] purpose and vision you keep on knowing
[2:04:24] where you are to where you are supposed
[2:04:26] to
[2:04:28] be after I bought my car my mother was
[2:04:32] in the back of my car and my wife was in
[2:04:34] the FL in the seat and we are
[2:04:37] traveling when this thing come on me I
[2:04:39] speak like a DEA and dumb person I just
[2:04:42] spoke to myself because if you led by
[2:04:45] the spirit I said hey time is running
[2:04:47] out on me two more years I was 23 I had
[2:04:52] to be a millionaire but time is running
[2:04:54] out on me I mean I didn't speak him I
[2:04:56] spoke out oh yeah you did my mother said
[2:05:01] can we go this journey in peace I said
[2:05:04] Mom I never insulted you I just told you
[2:05:07] what I'm going to do he said please you
[2:05:09] know this your billion million million
[2:05:12] make me go to toy please stop talking
[2:05:15] like that because you don't have 50,000
[2:05:17] you are talking about milliion when you
[2:05:19] drop me you continue with your
[2:05:22] million my I was pregnant with my vision
[2:05:26] and my mother wanted me to commit
[2:05:29] abortion ask women that are pregnant how
[2:05:32] they protect the baby in their womb I
[2:05:35] fought back I said mom two more years I
[2:05:40] will be he said if you said that again I
[2:05:43] get out of the car and I know my mother
[2:05:45] very strong woman I stopped the car Wind
[2:05:49] the glass down I get close to I said mom
[2:05:52] look at me two more years did you hear I
[2:05:55] said two I will be a millionaire you
[2:05:57] want to get down say yes of course I
[2:05:59] open the car she got down I bang the
[2:06:02] door start the car my wife said are you
[2:06:05] out of your mind that is your mother I
[2:06:07] said if you want I also drop you I drop
[2:06:10] away I left my mother on the
[2:06:13] road it was my vision it was not her
[2:06:16] vision yeah but she to see it happen
[2:06:19] because two years from that time I was a
[2:06:21] Miran and I bought her message is
[2:06:24] 198 she was a good driver so she chop
[2:06:26] out of the
[2:06:29] money so well the question was then does
[2:06:32] being a believer of the message P
[2:06:34] especially put you at an advantage
[2:06:36] absolutely because you now know
[2:06:38] principle yeah you now know principle
[2:06:41] you know I tell
[2:06:43] people forget about your
[2:06:46] logic logic is School way of
[2:06:51] reasoning your logic will take you from
[2:06:54] point A to
[2:06:56] B but it cannot take you beyond
[2:06:59] that after your point A to B your
[2:07:03] imagination start mhm imagination you
[2:07:07] can describe as Faith MH Ephesians
[2:07:11] 3:20 unto him who is able to do
[2:07:15] abundantly all that you can think or
[2:07:18] imagine
[2:07:19] when that things they T you in school
[2:07:21] end that imag that's that's why Napoleon
[2:07:26] said imagination will conquer the world
[2:07:29] MH Albert Essen said knowledge is
[2:07:33] limited to everything that is
[2:07:36] known but
[2:07:40] imagination can take you beyond what is
[2:07:43] known and that is
[2:07:46] fith did you get it it mhm that is faith
[2:07:50] faith yeah so takes you beyond what is
[2:07:52] known take you beyond that you
[2:07:54] know go and check the man called
[2:07:58] Tesla Tesla was one of the greatest gift
[2:08:02] God gave us in in technology and
[2:08:05] information development in our own age
[2:08:07] he said people are wondering how I knew
[2:08:10] all of these things that I did go and
[2:08:12] Google
[2:08:13] it he said many night I go by my bedside
[2:08:19] I take a book and I keep a paper
[2:08:21] inspiration no school will teach you
[2:08:24] that comes up I make note people see me
[2:08:28] every day get to the lab begin to do
[2:08:30] something he said sometime I keep the
[2:08:32] note in the morning I see something
[2:08:35] written there I take it to the lab it
[2:08:38] was the one of the greatest gift
[2:08:40] inspiration is like imagination it's
[2:08:43] beyond the four corner wall school what
[2:08:46] it will teach you and any body who is a
[2:08:49] Christian understand this because
[2:08:53] anybody
[2:08:54] else the thing the natural people call
[2:08:59] intuition is what we call inspiration
[2:09:02] insiration intuition is unau knowledge
[2:09:05] yes you get to a point where a situation
[2:09:09] arise you never read it from any book
[2:09:12] the holy spirit will said go left go
[2:09:15] right this is the way to do it you know
[2:09:17] this is not a man teaching you anything

[2:13:36] from there's no poverty there so I never
[2:13:40] pursue money I pursue purpose and in
[2:13:43] pursuing purpose all of these things
[2:13:45] were made available to me me our King
[2:13:49] listen this is not democracy
[2:13:51] Christianity is not democracy
[2:13:53] Christianity is theocracy a king over
[2:13:57] his
[2:13:57] subject in democracy mhm people vote
[2:14:02] their president M the president chooses
[2:14:06] ministers his ministers gives him advice
[2:14:09] MH if he didn't do well his ministers
[2:14:11] impeach him mhm in the country where I
[2:14:13] came from yes there is only one king who
[2:14:16] choose his subject yes the subject
[2:14:19] didn't choose the king the king choose
[2:14:21] the subject
[2:14:23] yes St John chapter 15 16 ver 13 you
[2:14:28] have not choos me but I have choosen you
[2:14:32] past and end you that you should go and
[2:14:35] bring forth more fruit so the will of
[2:14:39] the king is our Command yes so if you
[2:14:43] want to live in this country you have no
[2:14:46] opinion what ever the king says oh King
[2:14:50] live forever you do the will of the king
[2:14:52] amen then the king take care of you take

[2:14:58] family provide you everything you
[2:15:01] need this is Kingdom citizenship it's
[2:15:05] not not democracy people confuse it with
[2:15:09] democracy amen Jesus is not a president
[2:15:12] he's a king that's right and that's why
[2:15:15] and he got problem because
[2:15:18] they think he's come to over because
[2:15:20] they think there's no they ask him are
[2:15:22] you a king he told Pate you have said it
[2:15:25] by
[2:15:26] yourself he's a he was a king yes he's

[2:15:33] you don't if you know this I will call
[2:15:36] regions of angels from my kingdom and
[2:15:38] they take care of all of this things so
[2:15:40] we must understand that we are Kingdom
[2:15:44] citizens and leave kingom way of of life
[2:15:48] that's why we cannot follow the natural
[2:15:50] people to pursue money to pursue wealth
[2:15:54] we should pursue purpose Amen to stay in
[2:15:57] the will of God for our life every other
[2:16:00] thing will add to it man I've never had
[2:16:02] such an answer to uh to that question
[2:16:05] I've been blessed by that myself now uh
[2:16:08] I'm going to I've never I've had a lot
[2:16:10] of your interviews sure uh but I've
[2:16:12] never had anybody ask you this question
[2:16:15] specifically maybe because you are not
[2:16:16] Believers of the message but I I think I
[2:16:19] want to put you on record sure um you
[2:16:22] were a Catholic Roman Catholic that's
[2:16:24] correct and then you became a
[2:16:26] Pentecostal that's right what spark you
[2:16:28] to believe this message of the hour okay
[2:16:30] good very beautiful
[2:16:33] question you know God makes no mistake I
[2:16:37] told a
[2:16:38] story uh yesterday when I was uh
[2:16:41] beginning uh two days ago I told people
[2:16:43] there was a king who has a servant and
[2:16:47] the servant will always tell the
[2:16:49] king God never make mistake
[2:16:53] yes the king say it's okay until the
[2:16:56] King has an accident and cut his finger
[2:16:59] mhm and the servant tell him don't worry
[2:17:03] God never make any mistake M the king
[2:17:06] get
[2:17:07] angry God never made a mistake you see
[2:17:09] my finger cut you ask me to praise God
[2:17:12] that he never made a mistake the lock is
[2:17:14] subject to the prison H because you
[2:17:17] think he has taken it
[2:17:19] overboard usually the king go and hunt
[2:17:23] with this
[2:17:24] servant and because this servant has
[2:17:27] been imprisoned the king went to haunt
[2:17:31] alone in the process of Haunting the
[2:17:34] King was captured by the r mhm and they
[2:17:37] decided to use him for sacrifice MH but
[2:17:41] their God demand that they think they
[2:17:43] would any human being they are going to
[2:17:45] use would be perfect MH and in process
[2:17:48] of examining the king they find out his
[2:17:50] finger was cut so he's not good for the
[2:17:54] sacrifice and they have to release the
[2:17:57] king and the King came back and had aink
[2:18:01] and went to call his servant and said
[2:18:03] this thing you are saying appear to be
[2:18:05] truth but one thing I do not understand
[2:18:09] is why did this God allow me to put you
[2:18:11] in prison mhm the king said the the
[2:18:14] servant said everything God does it does
[2:18:17] it beautiful God know he said can you
[2:18:20] explain he said oh King if you did not
[2:18:23] put me in prison both of us would have G
[2:18:27] and hunt and perhaps if they have
[2:18:30] captured us and examined you and find
[2:18:33] you and you are deficient for it they
[2:18:35] would have used me for the sacrifice so
[2:18:37] God allow you to put me in prison so
[2:18:39] that I do not go and hunt with you so
[2:18:42] God never make a mistake yeah
[2:18:46] okay
[2:18:48] I became successful frankly before 25 I
[2:18:53] made my I made 2 million dollars yeah
[2:18:56] and
[2:18:58] um um success is like wifire when ignite
[2:19:03] ignite here so I decided to build a
[2:19:07] manufacturing motorcycle L chain you
[2:19:09] know you have a lot of bike I used to
[2:19:11] manufactured the chain the driving chain
[2:19:13] of
[2:19:14] motorbike I have before that
[2:19:20] by 25 some of the boys working for me
[2:19:24] some you know Nigeria were are very
[2:19:25] clever people some people met them and
[2:19:28] uh the people working for me in the
[2:19:30] eastern part of Nigeria and they tell
[2:19:33] them that uh they can help them make the
[2:19:37] double money so the boy sold goods from
[2:19:40] my store collected money from Traders
[2:19:43] and gave to these criminals M and those
[2:19:46] criminal locked them them up and this
[2:19:48] become a big thing in the process I had
[2:19:51] a problem because they are working for
[2:19:53] me this time my company was not
[2:19:55] Incorporated mhm 65 threaders sued me
[2:19:59] under vicarious liability so I have to
[2:20:03] be hiring lawyers every day you know
[2:20:05] that's why I say when you have problem
[2:20:08] don't think that problem is kill you God
[2:20:10] is working there are things you cannot
[2:20:13] see you don't know where it is
[2:20:16] leading so I have about six or seven
[2:20:20] lawyers working for me in the process of
[2:20:22] this I hired one of the lawyer who is a
[2:20:26] Believer an end time message he's late
[2:20:29] now
[2:20:30] by I always see this man carry bible and
[2:20:35] carry another black
[2:20:37] book and I was wondering this black book
[2:20:39] is carrying what is it all about you
[2:20:42] have Bible why do you need this black
[2:20:44] book I was a
[2:20:46] Pentecostal the first thing that
[2:20:48] happened is that I observed this guy I
[2:20:51] knew he had the life that I didn't have
[2:20:54] MH are you following what I'm saying I'm
[2:20:56] following and he was different he was
[2:21:00] different and I keep on saying
[2:21:04] H I hope this guy is not mix up you know
[2:21:10] it's not like I I don't know how to
[2:21:12] describe him but I could see a gentle
[2:21:16] quietness in him in every
[2:21:19] angle by this
[2:21:21] time I was becoming successful MH and
[2:21:26] and I find out even in my
[2:21:30] Pentecostal life I was having a diminish
[2:21:33] return uhhuh the more I worked hard to
[2:21:37] live right the more I see myself
[2:21:40] struggling yeah like at a time I almost
[2:21:44] more concluding is this thing not an AB
[2:21:47] doll story only men will see the good
[2:21:50] only good men will see the angel I been
[2:21:53] I I started questioning my belief MH in
[2:21:58] Pentecost
[2:22:00] so I became a Christian at the tend that
[2:22:03] age I never fool around but I'm
[2:22:06] beginning to see myself lusting after
[2:22:09] women and things like that and uh this
[2:22:15] brother love me stay around with
[2:22:18] me so so many time we talk and he wanted
[2:22:21] to talk he said the prophet I tell him
[2:22:23] please forget about this Prophet Bible
[2:22:25] is there why are we talking about
[2:22:26] Prophet when there's Bible Bible said
[2:22:28] that there's a word of God is clear in
[2:22:30] the Bible so he keep on telling me that
[2:22:35] this is a message for the end time God
[2:22:37] sent for his children mhm no matter what
[2:22:41] I struggle the only way I can become a
[2:22:44] normal human being is to eat seven
[2:22:47] spiritual seven C meal and if I don't
[2:22:50] have it that spiritual seven C Cal that
[2:22:52] I'll be having some deficiency in my
[2:22:55] life it got to a point that any slim
[2:22:59] sliek lady pass is hard for my head to
[2:23:02] stay straight and I I will turn like
[2:23:05] this he told me brother you are
[2:23:08] suffering from Wom
[2:23:16] womes
[2:23:20] I he said brother youed you are
[2:23:24] suffering from womes
[2:23:26] womes I said what is that he said
[2:23:29] because your head cannot stay
[2:23:31] straight so when he around I W out I
[2:23:34] said my head is going to St before you
[2:23:37] know it I don't know when my head has
[2:23:38] turn again said you see I told you I
[2:23:42] told
[2:23:43] you but I see because the if if you come
[2:23:47] to his house you see the picture of
[2:23:49] brother Braham you see this is so I I
[2:23:52] said this book we Are carrying is six
[2:23:53] and seven books of Moses m so we became
[2:23:58] friends after this court case MH I
[2:24:01] return return him now as our compan
[2:24:03] lawyer okay because you know there are
[2:24:05] some Christians who said you cannot
[2:24:07] believe the end time message and become
[2:24:09] a Christian or become a lawyer so many
[2:24:12] theories but God does everything
[2:24:15] beautiful that's right so I had this
[2:24:18] lawyer and when I wanted to build this
[2:24:20] chain Factory I asked him to travel with
[2:24:23] me to go and do the agreement so he flew
[2:24:26] with me to
[2:24:28] Taiwan I think this would be 81 or 82 or
[2:24:31] 83 from thaan we went to Japan we were
[2:24:35] in Osaka Plaza okay I rented a suit and
[2:24:38] both of us was in the suit okay and in

[2:26:11] when a Christian and then he said if you
[2:26:14] get a brid of a bucket and drum a ink in
[2:26:18] it that the the bridge of the that
[2:26:21] bridge has a power to disintegrate the
[2:26:24] ink that by no chemical form you can
[2:26:28] bring the ink back back when you

[2:29:58] quite something yeah I'm a Christian and
[2:29:59] I believe the message and I wanted them
[2:30:01] to know this is who I am this is what I
[2:30:04] believe and uh I don't compromise it in
[2:30:07] fact uh I used to have this badge Jesus

[2:30:57] we we have a lot of opportunities here
[2:30:59] in Africa but working with I've worked
[2:31:02] with young people and I work with young
[2:31:03] people a lot here our church here is uh
[2:31:05] really youth oriented I might say I
[2:31:08] realize that the greatest hindrance is
[2:31:10] capital uh you know uh Banks borrowing
[2:31:13] rates here not only in Uganda I also
[2:31:15] believe in n and most of the African
[2:31:17] country uh countries are very high if at
[2:31:20] all the young people can uh qualify for
[2:31:24] one and I'm talking about business
[2:31:26] oriented uh young people so what to you
[2:31:29] would be the best way for young people
[2:31:31] to raise capital okay let me say you
[2:31:34] know I also work hard to Mentor young
[2:31:39] people and um try to talk to
[2:31:42] them uh we do have question and answers
[2:31:45] also that I take them in one of the
[2:31:47] occasion where I was talking to young
[2:31:50] people one of the young man said look we
[2:31:52] have been over mentored but we have been
[2:31:55] under
[2:31:57] capitalized I tell him to shut
[2:32:00] up
[2:32:02] because he may not like it but the truth
[2:32:06] is that the first skill for you if you
[2:32:10] an enterpreneur his ability to create
[2:32:14] Capital you a creator
[2:32:17] Capital doesn't fall from
[2:32:19] Heaven I said you get a job whether you
[2:32:23] are carrying smant or block let's see
[2:32:26] your skill in managing and saving money
[2:32:31] because you know I talk with a lot of
[2:32:34] people sometime somebody tell me you
[2:32:35] know if you give me 100 million by next
[2:32:38] year I will be this you I tell him
[2:32:40] forget about that if you want to know
[2:32:42] the truth based on my experience Capital
[2:32:45] please you equation of only 20 to 25% in
[2:32:49] your success in business mhm the
[2:32:51] knowledge you have in that business PR
[2:32:54] more than 50%
[2:32:56] MH there are other things that is
[2:32:59] required to all come to place MH but
[2:33:02] capital is not the most important thing
[2:33:05] and that's why people who do not know
[2:33:08] have capital and when they lose the
[2:33:10] capital in business terminology we say
[2:33:14] you have learned in a hard way
[2:33:16] and what are we saying your school fees
[2:33:18] is more expensive there are things you
[2:33:21] needed to have learned before you get
[2:33:23] Capital yeah but you refuse to learn it
[2:33:25] and that's why you lose the capital and
[2:33:27] the capital you lose now become your
[2:33:29] school fees because there are things you
[2:33:31] have learned from that time that you
[2:33:33] need to go back to the drawing board to
[2:33:35] do so your face skill as an entrepreneur
[2:33:40] is to understand Resource Management M
[2:33:45] God cre create a man to be a manager
[2:33:48] there are three characteristic of
[2:33:52] resources that resources is not in
[2:33:54] plenty Supply is depletable in nature
[2:33:57] and can easily be used up so your
[2:34:00] ability to save and conserve money
[2:34:04] MH is your first skill to show you are
[2:34:07] born entrepreneur or that you are really
[2:34:10] an enterpreneur you must manage and
[2:34:13] deploy resources in a very appropriate
[2:34:17] way mhm Jesus met those five people he
[2:34:21] gave different talent and questioned the
[2:34:24] last person who buried it and said you
[2:34:26] mismanage the money you could have the
[2:34:29] wor you could have done the wor would
[2:34:32] have been to put it in a financial
[2:34:34] investment where it will yield back
[2:34:36] something you went to bury it that means
[2:34:39] you did not manage that resources to
[2:34:42] yield something you must separate
[2:34:45] yourself from your business if you are a
[2:34:48] business person M and know that this
[2:34:51] business need to grow generate income
[2:34:55] for its continuity so your ability to
[2:34:58] manage will will determine what more
[2:35:02] that will come to you or you are going
[2:35:04] nowhere MH
[2:35:07] so I've told a lot of
[2:35:10] people that you need to learn financial
[2:35:14] management as number number one scale if
[2:35:17] you are going into business in fact even
[2:35:19] running a church or any organization you
[2:35:22] need to learn financial management if
[2:35:24] you do not understand it you will it
[2:35:26] will be very difficult for you to make
[2:35:28] progress that's true and if you want to
[2:35:32] know I learned these principles from the
[2:35:35] word of
[2:35:36] God Jesus told us he was a
[2:35:40] businessman M he knew how to manage and
[2:35:44] deploy resources m one
[2:35:48] time I think it's in either John chapter
[2:35:51] 6 or Matthew he had a
[2:35:54] campaign and they had so many
[2:35:58] clients after the day was over he
[2:36:03] started a seminar a business seminar
[2:36:07] told his disciples give them to
[2:36:10] eat his disciples are natural people I
[2:36:14] said what do you mean give them to eat
[2:36:15] this is a desert did you keep any buet
[2:36:17] here how do we give them to eat in this
[2:36:20] difficult
[2:36:21] place but Jesus speak Faith he belied in
[2:36:26] his anointing he said we can't leave
[2:36:29] these people to go like this these are
[2:36:31] our cry entertain them until one of the
[2:36:34] disciples came back and said look you
[2:36:37] know what you're asking us to do are
[2:36:39] things that are impossible God never
[2:36:40] believed there's anything impossible but
[2:36:42] if you want to know there's a young boy
[2:36:43] here that has his launch box M two fces
[2:36:47] of fish and R said go and get it they
[2:36:50] get it they blessed it showed it to the
[2:36:52] owner the dynamic power come into it
[2:36:56] Atomic power yeah he took a back seat
[2:37:00] because he wanted to train these
[2:37:02] disciples these are clued men 11 clued
[2:37:07] people two of them are professionals the
[2:37:10] rest know nothing and started refining
[2:37:13] them for transformation leadership m M
[2:37:17] many pastors don't know how to dedicate
[2:37:20] to grow their people you want to do
[2:37:23] everything because you're a pastor you
[2:37:26] can't let people to learn from you to
[2:37:28] grow Jesus gave them and said give them
[2:37:31] to eat he took a back seat he could have
[2:37:33] been doing it but he wanted to show them
[2:37:37] the power of God and the people are
[2:37:39] giving if you give this man a fish
[2:37:40] another fish grow up give another bread
[2:37:42] bread grow up and they fed 5,000 men and
[2:37:47] women 5,000 they didn't count women and
[2:37:50] children after they have fed with that
[2:37:53] number five five two two two pieces of
[2:37:57] fish and five roofs of
[2:37:59] bread Bible recorded and they were
[2:38:03] filled what is that meaning customer
[2:38:07] satisfaction these customers were
[2:38:09] satisfied I I love that yeah it's a
[2:38:13] business skill yeah it's a campaign
[2:38:16] then Jesus went into financial
[2:38:18] management he said pick the crops on the
[2:38:22] ground let nothing be
[2:38:25] wasted God of creation who took two
[2:38:29] fishes and five pieces of bread to fed
[2:38:31] 5,000 what is he looking for the crop
[2:38:34] that fell on the
[2:38:36] ground Christians are wful yeah we do
[2:38:40] not manage things well we do not manage
[2:38:44] resources you go to to buet you eat
[2:38:46] carry food that you cannot eat and mess
[2:38:49] up the plate and all of those things you
[2:38:51] have One Life to Live I am wondering
[2:38:54] that the sisters who entertain me in the
[2:38:56] last two days will be saying what kind
[2:38:58] of human being is this because after I
[2:38:59] eat the plate with it I eat you will not
[2:39:01] see anything on top of
[2:39:03] it my wife say it's poverty I said
[2:39:07] no I said I say it's no it's not poverty
[2:39:11] it's Bible skill let nothing be wasted
[2:39:14] yeah pick the crops on the ground why is
[2:39:17] God asking them he's teaching them
[2:39:19] Financial skill now after they pick
[2:39:22] those crops on the
[2:39:23] ground the customers were
[2:39:26] satisfied if you satisfy your customer
[2:39:29] you don't look for them the following
[2:39:31] day they will be looking for you the
[2:39:33] following day Jesus left the people jump
[2:39:35] inside boat jump inside this one looking
[2:39:38] for him everywhere he is they finally
[2:39:40] met him oh master master what a
[2:39:43] wonderful that who have we been looking
[2:39:44] for you Jesus say why are you looking
[2:39:46] for me why are you looking for me they
[2:39:49] said Master hey that yester that
[2:39:52] yesterday message was wonderful oh Jesus
[2:39:56] said what is the title they said my oh
[2:39:59] my my oh my oh it was wonderful why why
[2:40:03] are you looking for me I want to know
[2:40:06] the people were hesitating say let me
[2:40:07] tell
[2:40:08] you you are not looking for bread you
[2:40:11] are looking for you are not looking it's
[2:40:12] not the thing that I said that attracted
[2:40:14] you you are looking for hand out this
[2:40:17] ministry is not for a hand out it's for
[2:40:19] transformation leaders is to make you a
[2:40:23] leader to change people's life amen from
[2:40:27] today you don't eat bread and you don't
[2:40:31] drink mineral water you drink my blood
[2:40:35] you eat my flesh ah they said this man
[2:40:39] is too tough he want us to depend on him
[2:40:42] completely his demand is too high but
[2:40:45] Bible say his church cut down from 17 to
[2:40:49] 12 a leader is not motivated by crowd
[2:40:53] that's why Jesus said B said if there's
[2:40:56] one person that don't want to leave the
[2:40:58] church is the holy spirit any other
[2:40:59] person can leave any other can leave you
[2:41:02] the natural people will jump up oh
[2:41:04] there's Revival look at our church is
[2:41:07] growing because that's what why many
[2:41:10] people have church member yeah and few
[2:41:13] Christians that's right
[2:41:16] if Christianity is what it is Nigeria
[2:41:18] would have changed do you know how many
[2:41:20] million people that are Christians in
[2:41:22] Nigeria but there are church members
[2:41:24] they are not Christians because they
[2:41:26] don't stand for any principle yeah they
[2:41:29] none of them can stand for any principle
[2:41:31] because it's a popular it's a Prosperity
[2:41:34] Gospel is not based on Christian
[2:41:37] principle living MH people are giving
[2:41:40] and taking bribe what Pastor judge
[2:41:43] churches how much tith come that's how
[2:41:45] people are giving it those things are
[2:41:47] not Bible principle that's
[2:41:50] right
[2:41:52] so the church dropped 12 he look at the
[2:41:56] 12 and said wouldn't you go away
[2:42:01] H the Peter make that memorable
[2:42:04] statement Lord to whom shall we
[2:42:07] go we are not in an
[2:42:10] enting we we had some
[2:42:12] business I used to be a Fisher man we a
[2:42:15] fishing company me and my brother James
[2:42:18] but since we met you you've not just
[2:42:20] taught us how to catch fish we are now
[2:42:22] catching human being our business has
[2:42:24] even improved only you have the word of
[2:42:27] eternal life where shall we go there's
[2:42:31] nothing like this in the face of the
[2:42:33] Earth Jesus say have I not chose you
[2:42:36] 12 one of you is a
[2:42:40] devil all of them say is it me is it I
[2:42:43] but the says things I said on purpose he
[2:42:46] put them on their toes to live quality
[2:42:49] life and things he let her lost one
[2:42:52] which is Judas but he used the other 12
[2:42:55] to create a transformation leadership
[2:42:58] some of them so committed to him that
[2:43:01] when they wanted to kill them he said I
[2:43:03] can't die the way you cruy my RO put me
[2:43:05] opposite down and they all see their
[2:43:08] testimony in their blood that is a
[2:43:11] quality leadership that came from him
[2:43:14] amen now what am I saying to run a
[2:43:17] business capital is important but not
[2:43:20] the most important thing you need skill
[2:43:24] I am a great believer in apprenticeship
[2:43:27] apprenticeship is one of the best
[2:43:28] university any young man can go what do
[2:43:31] I mean by that where you Ser under
[2:43:34] somebody to learn yeah every rudiment to
[2:43:38] run business is taught in apprenticeship
[2:43:41] we learn purchase we learn accountancy
[2:43:44] because your book must balance every day
[2:43:46] in informal way we learn Administration
[2:43:50] we we keep books everything they teach
[2:43:53] people in a formal way in we do research
[2:43:57] yeah in informal way that's the
[2:43:59] university I went MH so 200 naira was
[2:44:03] not a problem because I have the
[2:44:05] rudiment everything that require to run
[2:44:07] business so this skill when you put
[2:44:10] small capital on it you can see it grow
[2:44:13] many time people who if in my country I
[2:44:16] can tell you a young man that went to
[2:44:19] University and a young man that did the
[2:44:21] apprenticeship if you give an
[2:44:23] apprenticing boy 100,000 and give a
[2:44:25] university person 1 million give them 5
[2:44:28] years the 100,000 will pass the other
[2:44:30] man and take a lead because he knew
[2:44:33] every rudiment how to run business so
[2:44:36] people need to study MH and I tell young
[2:44:40] people don't tell me if I give you 1
[2:44:43] billion you you would change the word m
[2:44:46] show
[2:44:47] me what you do one business you have
[2:44:50] taken from point A to point B how you've
[2:44:54] been able to manage this and then what
[2:44:58] is holding you now to move to C is
[2:45:00] capital but I can see you took this
[2:45:03] thing from $1,000 and you made it to
[2:45:06] become $5,000 and what needed this to
[2:45:09] grow is
[2:45:10] capital the money will make itself
[2:45:13] available I tell you yeah you don't need
[2:45:16] to go to bank yeah you can borrow from
[2:45:19] bank but borrowing from bank I advise
[2:45:21] people who are starting business not to
[2:45:24] borrow more than 20% maximum 10% of
[2:45:27] their Capital because bank money have
[2:45:31] interest Saturday Sunday public or a day
[2:45:35] and they ask you to corize it with
[2:45:37] everything you have if you make me some
[2:45:40] people have had
[2:45:41] 20,000 which they could have managed and
[2:45:43] lived their life and and went to borrow
[2:45:45] 80,000 from bank this 80,000
[2:45:49] Bank chop interest finished took their
[2:45:52] 20,000 they are left with nothing so
[2:45:56] it's better you have one thing that you
[2:45:57] have successfully managed and keep it so
[2:46:00] you can borrow from to expand your
[2:46:03] business when you are starting a
[2:46:05] business when you want to borrow borrow
[2:46:08] don't B to speculate yeah B to do
[2:46:13] already mastered business so it is a
[2:46:16] shortterm borrowing continue to do
[2:46:20] business and plow back Capital into your
[2:46:23] business so when I started my business
[2:46:26] anything I do not have in my office I do
[2:46:29] not have it in the
[2:46:30] home before I have air condition in the
[2:46:33] house I have it in the office because
[2:46:35] that's where I'm making the money I grow
[2:46:37] the business the need of it when I
[2:46:41] decided to expand my business and
[2:46:43] started hiring people
[2:46:45] I paid my staff higher salary than I
[2:46:49] paid myself because I the skill I'm
[2:46:52] looking for if I pay them what I'm
[2:46:54] paying myself I will not get them but I
[2:46:58] knew I need them therefore I take less
[2:47:01] salary because I am the owner and
[2:47:03] whatever that business grow become is my
[2:47:05] own business I have traveled with some
[2:47:08] of my stuff they enter into a a shop I'm
[2:47:12] buying shoe $300 I'm I'm thinking is the
[2:47:14] head correct I look for TR for $50 25
[2:47:18] that will fit me because I need money to
[2:47:20] put Capital so I'm not competing with my
[2:47:23] staff because I own the business yeah so
[2:47:25] I knew the need to rain Capital into the
[2:47:29] business to be able to grow it because
[2:47:31] the business will continue to grow with
[2:47:33] more return Capital but if you fire the
[2:47:37] staff you take a certificate you look
[2:47:38] for another job so but some people their
[2:47:42] ego is what they serve so so they
[2:47:45] started competing with their staff and
[2:47:47] therefore making that if you have to do
[2:47:50] this I have to do this you are not a
[2:47:52] leader at that point you a leader you as
[2:47:55] a leader you know this guy is working
[2:47:57] for you you also providing him
[2:47:59] leadership so you are not competing with
[2:48:02] him but you are want that institution to
[2:48:04] grow yeah this is my
[2:48:06] mentality until you get the person where
[2:48:08] you begin to also train him to think
[2:48:11] like entrepreneur so to run business the
[2:48:14] first ability you have is to manage and
[2:48:17] deploy resources once you can do that
[2:48:20] well the limit will the sky will be your
[2:48:22] limit today my company
[2:48:26] borrow in every Nigerian Bank including
[2:48:29] standard chattered on a negative PL I
[2:48:33] didn't pick it on the street it's a live
[2:48:35] dream it's part of those things I'm
[2:48:37] telling you I asked God he said ask me
[2:48:39] for big
[2:48:40] thing no Bank ask me for Cora to learn
[2:48:44] money in Nigeria
[2:48:46] M Central Bank of Nigeria knew I lent
[2:48:49] money on a negative pled even including
[2:48:52] from them they borrow me on a negative
[2:48:55] pledge means I do not pledge to anybody
[2:48:58] and I cannot pledge to you it's a
[2:49:01] position of strength it doesn't come
[2:49:04] easy and because I have these resources
[2:49:08] available to me does not make me dance
[2:49:11] naked because if I if I mismanage it
[2:49:15] I will go back to where other people is
[2:49:18] but when you have unlimited resources in
[2:49:22] that way you can take on any business
[2:49:25] with a position of strength but it is a
[2:49:28] life dream that I have that I prayed for
[2:49:33] and somebody thought my head was not
[2:49:36] correct because when you are saying you
[2:49:38] don't want to see a business you want to
[2:49:41] do and you don't have money to do it
[2:49:42] it's like we are saying you want to be
[2:49:44] God because because Bible say answer it
[2:49:46] everything you have unlimited resources
[2:49:48] but I did I I pray for something some
[2:49:53] people cannot under you your imagination
[2:49:55] will break your head when you think
[2:49:57] about it but God give me Grace to have
[2:50:00] that kind of faith and he had helped me
[2:50:03] today we run business in Nigeria we run
[2:50:06] business in Ghana in Koda in um in uh in
[2:50:11] in Gabon we opened seron 3 years ago go
[2:50:15] I just registered Zimbabwe last year and
[2:50:18] then we bought a company in Japan so we
[2:50:21] are we we created Nigerian multinational
[2:50:24] brand just by 200 NAA the grace of God
[2:50:28] and hard working God has shown his might
[2:50:31] in the little things we are doing and
[2:50:33] that's why I'm confident to tell any
[2:50:35] young boy no mountain is too high no
[2:50:38] dream is too extreme you got to have
[2:50:41] faith in your God and be willing to dear
[2:50:43] life amen amen amen now the last
[2:50:47] question that will come from me uh here
[2:50:50] a lot of people when they get into
[2:50:52] business and then they prosper in bus in
[2:50:55] business uh they get this temptation to
[2:50:57] enter politics uh especially here in in
[2:51:01] Africa that happens quite often money is
[2:51:03] synonymous with politics I know yourself
[2:51:06] perhaps you've uh you might have been
[2:51:10] asked to join politics what kept you
[2:51:12] away and were you asked at any time well
[2:51:15] I'm a Christian um uh I would like to
[2:51:18] manage my family first of all um I'm not
[2:51:22] a politicians I it's it's actually
[2:51:25] difficult to be a politician because um
[2:51:28] what Drive politics is um popularity
[2:51:32] yeah and to be a
[2:51:35] politician and to be po to to be a a
[2:51:39] politicians and to create
[2:51:42] that popularity M you will not have
[2:51:46] character yeah and um for me um when you
[2:51:53] cannot keep your word when when you
[2:51:58] cannot when you compromise when you want
[2:52:01] to compromise you have to lose cap
[2:52:05] character yeah to compromise yeah so and
[2:52:08] my greatest asset is my character amen
[2:52:12] um so I cannot be a politician there
[2:52:14] nothing because politics is about
[2:52:17] compromise a little here a little here
[2:52:20] and the whole thing is diluted so a
[2:52:22] Christian I do not believe truly that
[2:52:24] anybody who is a true Christian can fit
[2:52:26] into politics you must make room for
[2:52:30] compromise to be a politician I think
[2:52:31] that says it all because principle is
[2:52:33] not what drives it thank you now I have
[2:52:37] uh someone called Joseph um I don't know
[2:52:40] where you are from if you ask sending a
[2:52:42] question please tell us where you are
[2:52:43] from uh the question is uh how should I
[2:52:47] leave this satday job should just leave
[2:52:49] and start with
[2:52:52] anything I will advise if you have a
[2:52:55] family don't jump out that's why we
[2:52:58] advise people to be able to find their
[2:53:02] feet before they get a wife because once
[2:53:05] you have a wife and have a children you
[2:53:07] have a responsibility and there are some
[2:53:09] speed you cannot run we have an adage in
[2:53:12] our vernacular that the hand
[2:53:14] that has a young chicken does not sleep
[2:53:17] on top of a tree yeah must come down so
[2:53:20] once you start making family you have
[2:53:23] responsibility to sustain and to support
[2:53:26] your family but when you are single you
[2:53:29] can take more risk if you need to sleep
[2:53:31] under a car you sleep under the car
[2:53:33] that's the time to struggle to be able
[2:53:35] to make it so that's why it's important
[2:53:38] you are not the first thing God Gave To
[2:53:41] A man was not a wife he gave him a job
[2:53:43] it's okay a work so you need to get a
[2:53:46] work before you take a wife but if you
[2:53:48] already have a a wife what I will advise
[2:53:51] you keep that job but don't totally
[2:53:55] depend on that job that's why if you
[2:53:58] understand this you will not have time
[2:54:01] to reply every text I have males here
[2:54:05] when they become 1,000 that's how I read
[2:54:08] them I delete it that's how I read it m
[2:54:10] in fact if you are not on my profile I
[2:54:13] will not mhm take your calls because
[2:54:15] it's a distraction but there are people
[2:54:17] whose job is make sure they WhatsApp and
[2:54:19] forward every message nobody has come to
[2:54:22] Guinness book of Le because you are the
[2:54:24] first person that forward or Whatsapp
[2:54:26] mail these things are distractions yeah
[2:54:29] um for a lot of people who do not know
[2:54:32] from the age of 25 till
[2:54:34] today I don't watch television I have no
[2:54:38] television in my house wow and what this
[2:54:40] has done to me and I be I'm a Christian
[2:54:43] and I be honest I travel I stay in a
[2:54:46] hotel for one month I don't know where
[2:54:48] the remote control is so I shut myself
[2:54:51] off from distraction
[2:54:53] MH because there are too many things
[2:54:56] competing for your
[2:54:58] attention there's too many things
[2:55:00] competing for your
[2:55:03] attention for you to be successful you
[2:55:06] have to have a single mind what do I
[2:55:08] mean by a single
[2:55:10] mind every one of us is a power station
[2:55:15] if you
[2:55:16] can if you brother said it go and check
[2:55:20] if you can channel the energy of your
[2:55:25] thought in One
[2:55:26] Direction the power of focus can break a
[2:55:29] bottle yeah H there
[2:55:34] electricity actually you are generating
[2:55:36] electricity that generating
[2:55:39] electricity in this room where we are
[2:55:42] there are voices that are going around
[2:55:44] here moving you don't see it I don't see
[2:55:47] it there's a power station but we are
[2:55:50] irradiating things from our thought
[2:55:52] process if I radiate doubt there are
[2:55:56] doubts that are going on I will attract
[2:55:58] them into my life if I radiate faith and
[2:56:01] positive thing I will track them into my
[2:56:03] life so signals are moving in here
[2:56:06] that's why said you are a receiving
[2:56:09] station and you are a transmission
[2:56:11] station
[2:56:12] MH but it depends on what you are
[2:56:15] transmitting depend on what you are
[2:56:17] going to receive so the first thing you
[2:56:19] need to do is your thought process how
[2:56:21] do you think because as a man think it
[2:56:24] in his heart so he is the first thing
[2:56:27] you need to work on is your thought
[2:56:29] process to make sure your thought is
[2:56:33] correct and bible teach us how to think
[2:56:37] whatever is pure whatever is honest
[2:56:40] whatever is of good report guide your
[2:56:44] thought process if you can get it right
[2:56:46] from your thought process every other
[2:56:48] thing will fit in that's right so the
[2:56:51] first thing this young man need to do is
[2:56:53] to said I want to own my own
[2:56:59] business desire that and determined to
[2:57:04] do it first of
[2:57:05] all
[2:57:07] therefore you need to find a way to
[2:57:09] support your wife to find a small
[2:57:13] resources if you want to go and take a
[2:57:15] risk when you come back go to your job
[2:57:18] in the morning then come back in your
[2:57:21] home to start practicing your work see
[2:57:24] what you are need to do and begin to do
[2:57:27] it by the side of the way as God
[2:57:29] continue to bless you over it there's
[2:57:31] got to be a place where you're going to
[2:57:33] take a Quon R and take a decision and
[2:57:35] move but don't be Reckless and leave
[2:57:38] everything and move if you are single I
[2:57:40] will tell you quit tomorrow M but if you
[2:57:42] already if you already have a family
[2:57:44] don't do that because you cannot uh jeze
[2:57:48] the life of those children well there
[2:57:50] you have it Joseph thank you brother
[2:57:52] cosmas now this uh this one is Alias Ina
[2:57:57] says uh God bless you Pastor and the
[2:57:59] guest is it possible or good to start
[2:58:02] different projects with small small
[2:58:03] capital or it's better you start one and
[2:58:05] specialize in it start one make success
[2:58:08] of that one then move into another one
[2:58:11] don't take three four five project
[2:58:14] that's this what what works for me the
[2:58:17] success you make in one will ignite to
[2:58:19] the second one and it's a reference
[2:58:21] point then you become a reference to
[2:58:23] success every other thing works well I
[2:58:27] had a young man here uh Daniel he told
[2:58:29] me before we started that he had the
[2:58:31] question I'd like to give you an
[2:58:32] opportunity if you can take a microphone
[2:58:34] quickly you you have another
[2:58:38] microphone we can give him this one if
[2:58:40] he doesn't
[2:58:42] have and this one
[2:58:49] yeah God bless you all God bless you
[2:58:51] yeah my question is what does Plan B
[2:58:56] come to be executed when run
[2:59:00] when when you're running out to your
[2:59:02] vision and how do you make it correspond
[2:59:05] with your faith in
[2:59:08] God I want to make sure that I get your
[2:59:11] questions to be able to answer it
[2:59:13] problem properly when does Plan B come
[2:59:17] into place yes that's your question yes
[2:59:20] when do when does Plan B kickoff in your
[2:59:23] life Journey yes
[2:59:27] okay
[2:59:29] um mean
[2:59:31] business yeah like
[2:59:33] in business like in business all your
[2:59:36] life the passion that you want or
[2:59:39] something that you want to get in life
[2:59:41] okay fine I can answer that question
[2:59:46] um you
[2:59:49] know when do you really think you are
[2:59:52] running out of
[2:59:54] vision because you you are never going
[2:59:56] to run out of vision if that vision is a
[2:59:58] true
[3:00:01] Vision will your vision be tested yes
[3:00:05] will your vision be subjected to try yes
[3:00:09] but a man or a woman with a vision you
[3:00:12] cannot talk him of it if it is a true
[3:00:16] Vision it may take time it may waste
[3:00:19] time but that Vision will obviously
[3:00:22] going to come to
[3:00:23] pass Plan B is important but Plan B many
[3:00:28] time show doubt in your plan
[3:00:32] a but there are situations where you
[3:00:35] need to have plan
[3:00:36] B but a many time the way people made it
[3:00:42] in life is that you close the bridge you
[3:00:45] break the bridge and that is to say I'm
[3:00:47] not coming back
[3:00:49] here once you know there's a link to
[3:00:52] take you back you can easily Retreat
[3:00:55] because you want to quickly run back to
[3:00:58] that nobody make
[3:01:00] success that did not Frank Chris
[3:01:03] speaking got to a position like I should
[3:01:06] throw in Towell people listen to my
[3:01:09] success story they just thought from the
[3:01:12] time my uncle said settle me I keep on
[3:01:15] making money life start coming Rosy no
[3:01:18] it's not
[3:01:19] true the person talking to you I've been
[3:01:22] bankrupt three
[3:01:24] times but when we talk success story
[3:01:27] nobody I don't bring that
[3:01:30] up we talk success
[3:01:33] story
[3:01:35] but all of those things that happen is a
[3:01:39] training
[3:01:40] ground I actually don't call it f fail
[3:01:44] failure failure I call it mistakes why I
[3:01:47] call it mistake is that it's a learning
[3:01:50] curve that's why I encourage people to
[3:01:55] determine in what they want to do and
[3:01:58] wait for it at that time you feel like
[3:02:01] throwing in toell there are many times
[3:02:04] you feel in throwing in
[3:02:07] toell I made success before
[3:02:12] 23 actually by 21 I was already
[3:02:16] successful but in between 21 and
[3:02:20] 22 I lost all my Capital I lost my
[3:02:25] Capital that I owe my landlord so if you
[3:02:29] are ow your landlord today the person
[3:02:31] speaking to you had owe landlord 6
[3:02:34] months I couldn't pay for my shop my
[3:02:37] working
[3:02:38] Place 6 months I couldn't pay one year
[3:02:41] for where I was living
[3:02:44] actually one day I was in this I was in
[3:02:47] the shop my landlord jti IED him coming
[3:02:53] there's something we call show grass
[3:02:55] people thread there's a show glass the
[3:02:57] count there I hid
[3:03:00] under because the most embarrassing
[3:03:03] thing to go through is to meet an angry
[3:03:05] around Lord I he I didn't want to see
[3:03:09] the man say where is he where is he my
[3:03:13] boy I said no day he said okay come out
[3:03:16] come out let me lock the door I still
[3:03:18] stay where I am when I hear the door I
[3:03:20] said here he said please come
[3:03:23] out I thought he would change his mind I
[3:03:27] have gone through that embarrassment he
[3:03:28] locked me out and take the sh key of his
[3:03:31] shop he said if you get my money come to
[3:03:33] meet
[3:03:34] me but we don't tell this story that man
[3:03:38] was alive when I became a billionaire he
[3:03:40] did he just di few years ago that locked
[3:03:43] me out
[3:03:44] so I've gone through things but is it
[3:03:47] the time to give up things were so
[3:03:51] bad I've married have a wife to take
[3:03:54] care
[3:03:55] of and there were no food somebody came
[3:03:58] for my wedding he has given me a waying
[3:04:02] scale I believe in Dignity of Labor I
[3:04:06] never give up on myself I took the way
[3:04:10] scale to the market I Dro it on the
[3:04:12] ground I CR I said 68 kg line up
[3:04:18] yourself make you check your weight the
[3:04:20] people line up the first person want to
[3:04:21] CL I said wait where's your money 10 C
[3:04:24] everything is
[3:04:26] business I created business I started
[3:04:29] collecting money and people were cling
[3:04:31] taking the Mone and I took all the money
[3:04:34] I went back home my wife asked me what
[3:04:35] did you do I said I took this scale to
[3:04:38] the market and people were criming on it
[3:04:40] she cried like a little baby because
[3:04:43] because for her it was so humiliating is
[3:04:45] it too bad that this is what you have to
[3:04:48] do my are you follow what I'm saying
[3:04:51] yeah my wife does her certificate and
[3:04:53] went to get a job to support me
[3:04:58] financially God give you a wife if you
[3:05:01] are married to support you but he did
[3:05:04] not give you a wife for the wife to take
[3:05:06] the responsibility of your home that's
[3:05:08] why a good wife brother abam said after
[3:05:11] the baptism of the Holy Spirit the best
[3:05:13] thing God can give to a man is a good
[3:05:15] wife that woman is a help mate a help
[3:05:19] that is meant for you so a woman shows
[3:05:22] up in a man's life to help him but for
[3:05:24] him to help you you have to be doing
[3:05:26] something so when my wife saw that I was
[3:05:28] serious and I wanted to support her by
[3:05:32] the the thing I did she took up a job
[3:05:35] and was supporting me that's why the
[3:05:39] company I build you call C charies is a
[3:05:42] combination of my name and my wife name
[3:05:44] I am Cous my wife was name is Charity I
[3:05:47] didn't want to call it C charity so he
[3:05:49] look local so I call it CIS it look
[3:05:52] Greek some people thought it was a Greek
[3:05:55] company it's my name and my wife name
[3:05:57] that I combined so I never gave up on
[3:06:03] myself if I gave up on myself I would
[3:06:06] have stayed back in America like I told
[3:06:07] you when I get opportunity to travel to
[3:06:10] America but I believe I will succeed
[3:06:14] your belief to succeed must be greater
[3:06:17] than your fear to fail for you to
[3:06:20] succeed so once you keep on keeping that
[3:06:22] plan B as an exit way many time you want
[3:06:26] to run back there you want to run back
[3:06:28] there the correcting is burn the
[3:06:31] bridge I told you brother Abraham said I
[3:06:35] told God if I
[3:06:38] die eating this food I will come to
[3:06:41] heaven and I tell you I trusted you and
[3:06:43] and I
[3:06:44] die that means when you put Faith to
[3:06:48] work you are close to a mad person
[3:06:52] because only you can see the things you
[3:06:54] are doing is contrary to whatever
[3:06:57] everybody is saying but your inner man
[3:07:01] continued to speak back to you and said
[3:07:03] tomorrow will be better than today this
[3:07:05] is not the time to give up you become
[3:07:08] less rest you knock at every door until
[3:07:11] it open not he but not he that knock and
[3:07:14] went away but he that knock it you
[3:07:16] continue to knock
[3:07:20] consistently no success come easy if
[3:07:23] success come easy everybody will be
[3:07:25] successful whether spiritual and natural
[3:07:29] there are many people who are Christians
[3:07:31] even in their Christian Life they still
[3:07:33] struggling with one thing or the other
[3:07:36] it doesn't come easy but if you desire
[3:07:39] it if you are hungry for it there is a
[3:07:42] promise is blessed are they that thirst
[3:07:45] and hunger for they shall be filed that
[3:07:48] second part of it if you truly hunger
[3:07:52] that second part of it feel will come
[3:07:55] because it's also a promise and that is
[3:07:57] not completely depending in your hand so
[3:08:00] uh I don't know when point B comes in
[3:08:03] place each individual need to decide
[3:08:06] where his point B come from but many
[3:08:09] time I don't have point
[3:08:11] B I had one option that I'm going to
[3:08:14] succeed and I pursued it and God helped
[3:08:17] me and I became
[3:08:21] successful but I have I have situations
[3:08:24] frankly that made me like forget about
[3:08:28] this I've had situations that make me
[3:08:31] like do you want to continue to try
[3:08:34] this and God did the same thing to all
[3:08:36] his
[3:08:38] children Abraham Isaac didn't come at 9
[3:08:43] 9 years that he become a laughing M
[3:08:46] matter to
[3:08:47] Abraham Abraham laugh also sah laughed
[3:08:52] because like can we continue to tell
[3:08:54] this joke 100 years old but the angel
[3:08:59] said according to the time of Life by
[3:09:02] this time next year for everything under
[3:09:05] the AG there is a time and there is a
[3:09:07] purpose when that time come Paul say
[3:09:10] flesh and blood will not confir it will
[3:09:13] happen but you need to be there to to
[3:09:17] prove to Satan that you truly believe
[3:09:21] that this promise over you will be there
[3:09:23] and you will be making effort and acting
[3:09:26] like it's going to happen and if you are
[3:09:30] consistent you never doubt Jesus said if
[3:09:34] you say to this three be thou remove and
[3:09:37] shall not
[3:09:40] doubt in other words if you doubt he
[3:09:43] will not remove and shall not doubt what
[3:09:47] will make it remove is that you shall
[3:09:48] not doubt that's why prop said if you
[3:09:50] say to a mountain be removed and a grain
[3:09:53] of
[3:09:54] sand move that day tomorrow a cup of
[3:09:59] sand move if you are consistent and stay
[3:10:02] like that that mountain will come down
[3:10:05] any mountain in your life Financial
[3:10:08] Mountain whatever opposition that it is
[3:10:11] to come down but sometime we have more
[3:10:13] faith in the negative than in the in the
[3:10:16] positive and they still faith and
[3:10:19] because God honor Faith he works that
[3:10:21] way take for instance a lady goes to
[3:10:24] hospital and the doctor check him and
[3:10:25] say oh there's a um um there's a a RS in
[3:10:30] your breast without her saying the devil
[3:10:33] will say
[3:10:35] cancer she said cancer then the next
[3:10:38] thing the devil tell her dead then in
[3:10:40] her subconscious he registered dead
[3:10:43] whatever you are telling her she's a
[3:10:45] dead dead I'm going to die children dead
[3:10:48] dead dead she will die if you continue
[3:10:52] like that know there are people who have
[3:10:55] been
[3:10:57] diagonised
[3:10:59] wronging and they started believing it
[3:11:02] and that disease shows into their life
[3:11:04] this is
[3:11:05] scientific there are people who have
[3:11:07] dioniz rightly and they refuse they
[3:11:09] reject it and refuse it and that never
[3:11:12] become a
[3:11:14] reality so there are Faith works every
[3:11:18] time very consistent but that Faith must
[3:11:22] be held with no turning back and that's
[3:11:26] why it's like a
[3:11:28] risk but brother Abraham said I was I
[3:11:31] wanted to pray the man the man said no
[3:11:33] no we don't said the man said why do you
[3:11:35] rob me the only hope I
[3:11:39] have
[3:11:41] faith or hope
[3:11:43] is the only reason for existence when a
[3:11:47] life has no hope it will submit to
[3:11:50] Suicide hope is the reason of
[3:11:54] existence the hope we have is not a
[3:11:56] hopeless hope the hope we have as
[3:11:59] Believers are guaranteed hope am
[3:12:03] amen Romans chap
[3:12:05] 5:3 for we glory in
[3:12:08] Tribulation why do you glory glory means
[3:12:11] something that makes you have we glory
[3:12:13] in Tribulation tribulation means
[3:12:15] trial why because tribulation work it
[3:12:18] patience God is training you for patient
[3:12:21] wait on me patience experience
[3:12:24] experience hope hope make it not ashamed
[3:12:28] God is the Galant of your hope he's the
[3:12:31] under liigh this hope is not you are not
[3:12:34] hoping on on on
[3:12:37] emptiness if it is on God it's guarantee
[3:12:40] that it will bring something so the need
[3:12:43] to be stubborn with your faith I read a
[3:12:46] place to the church yesterday where
[3:12:47] brother
[3:12:49] said just one when he knew he had the
[3:12:53] word of God for it he became
[3:12:57] Reckless to be Reckless means to throw
[3:13:00] caution on the Wind you don't care
[3:13:02] anymore he said can the Church of God be
[3:13:06] Reckless with their
[3:13:08] faith that's a topic I taught on
[3:13:11] yesterday how to live in
[3:13:14] 2024 is to be Reckless with your faith
[3:13:18] if you find it in the word of God don't
[3:13:20] doubt it throw caution on the wing if
[3:13:23] God cannot keep his word can I keep it
[3:13:26] mhm you didn't hear me if God cannot
[3:13:29] keep his word can I keep it no no I have
[3:13:33] somebody's word for it Jehovah said this
[3:13:36] I read it and I believe it I put all my
[3:13:39] faith in it if I die trusting God that's
[3:13:42] the best place is to die that's the amen
[3:13:45] there was one Ronald uh I I think um you
[3:13:49] might have answered him in the in the
[3:13:50] answer you gave to him as well but I do
[3:13:52] not know I'll just read it and see if
[3:13:54] you have any addition to put um curious
[3:13:57] why do you think most inspiring young
[3:14:00] entrepreneurs give up on their
[3:14:01] entrepreneurship aspirations and settle
[3:14:03] for salary jobs what can keep them
[3:14:06] motivated the only thing that can keep
[3:14:09] them motivated is hunger in their heart
[3:14:11] if they give up on their dream fank
[3:14:13] speaking they never believed it at all
[3:14:15] it's like saying somebody is a Christian
[3:14:17] today and tomorrow he's not a Christian
[3:14:19] he had never had experience in his
[3:14:21] belief once you have experience in your
[3:14:23] belief nothing takes you out of
[3:14:25] it that's my belief you know you you the
[3:14:29] the you know you know when life make no
[3:14:32] sense is When Faith makes
[3:14:35] sense s faith is not something you see
[3:14:38] it's not because it happened it's
[3:14:41] something that
[3:14:43] and people keep on
[3:14:45] saying you know when Jesus said
[3:14:49] whatsoever means anything at all people
[3:14:52] there are new things people are
[3:14:54] discovering but so many people think
[3:14:57] faith has a limit where it stopped the
[3:15:00] woman with the issue of the blood she
[3:15:02] she introduced a Fai that were no record
[3:15:06] in the Bible before then there's nobody
[3:15:08] that has touched the Hem of a garment of
[3:15:11] a man and his blood issue stop any
[3:15:14] Christians can create his own faith
[3:15:16] today
[3:15:19] by taking risk to die to say on this I
[3:15:23] believe God
[3:15:25] amen
[3:15:28] amen sure uh I think we'll just uh we'll
[3:15:33] just come back pause and then come back
[3:15:35] after a while for a little
[3:15:37] break

[3:25:25] Prince Zimbabwe right yes sir just when
[3:25:27] you come introduce yourself your names
[3:25:29] and then you just ask you a question
[3:25:31] okay I am brother Prince from Zimbabwe I
[3:25:33] am a brother prince prince okay from
[3:25:36] Zimbabwe I am a young Minister still
[3:25:37] growing up um I have a question pastor
[3:25:41] you know the ministry on its own is a
[3:25:44] very like time take in terms of time
[3:25:46] sure it takes a lot of your time just
[3:25:48] Ministry on its own and it has a lot of
[3:25:51] requirements then business as well on
[3:25:54] its own takes a lot of time and there's
[3:25:56] a lot of requirements that are attached
[3:25:57] to it then uh like you uh I've seen this
[3:26:01] video of you preaching in the streets
[3:26:03] which is where I started preaching in
[3:26:05] the streets you know it takes a lot of
[3:26:07] your energy and a lot of your time how
[3:26:09] do you get to manage you know these
[3:26:11] three paradigms of going in the streets
[3:26:14] and preaching at the same time managing
[3:26:17] the ministry at the same time managing
[3:26:19] your your your growing business because
[3:26:22] if as it is it's a very big business it
[3:26:25] needs you to be there hands on although
[3:26:27] you might have some people who take care
[3:26:29] of your day-to-day business but they
[3:26:31] will definitely come to you with you
[3:26:33] know very complex and uh situations how
[3:26:36] do you get to manage such a thing and
[3:26:38] how can it how can I manage it as as
[3:26:41] well as a young person who is still
[3:26:44] growing and once has a vision of someday
[3:26:48] you know in the nearest of the Futures
[3:26:50] uh by faith to get to exactly where you
[3:26:53] are okay let's be very sincere about
[3:26:59] it something has to
[3:27:03] suffer we always hear about finding a
[3:27:06] balance there's no perfect
[3:27:08] [Music]
[3:27:10] balance
[3:27:11] today where I am if I look
[3:27:16] back I wish I could have done better
[3:27:19] than I did especially with the attention
[3:27:24] I should have given to my children than
[3:27:27] the time I spend with too many things
[3:27:30] that were competing for my
[3:27:33] attention so
[3:27:37] um the same thing happened in brother
[3:27:40] Brown's life in in most of the ministers
[3:27:42] life sometime we devote so much time try
[3:27:48] to help and Mentor other people we
[3:27:51] mismanage our home finding a balance is
[3:27:55] usually very
[3:27:57] challenging uh something I'm not very
[3:28:01] proud to say but really embarrassing to
[3:28:05] me I really look for a child when I had
[3:28:09] my first son I was too busy with so many
[3:28:14] things that this boy don't see
[3:28:18] me until he grew up understanding
[3:28:21] everybody is calling me aa aa means boss
[3:28:25] so he what he called me is AA he doesn't
[3:28:27] call me
[3:28:29] Daddy I say it's embarrassing to me but
[3:28:32] I had to own
[3:28:34] up and why because I didn't stay home
[3:28:38] too often for him to see me and and play
[3:28:41] the part of a dad but because he only
[3:28:46] see me maybe once in a week or sometime
[3:28:50] two times in a month or three because I
[3:28:53] am here I am here I am other places it
[3:28:56] affected my friendship with them we are
[3:28:59] much better today but not young children
[3:29:03] so that's why I'm saying something must
[3:29:06] give up something must give way I I I I
[3:29:09] don't know if what I'm saying is making
[3:29:11] sense and I'm not saying my own was the
[3:29:15] best I I'm admitting in public because
[3:29:18] I'm speaking public that I made a
[3:29:20] mistake so there's no perfect human
[3:29:23] being no perfect
[3:29:27] life if I knew what I knew today I would
[3:29:31] have let some other 10 suffer more but
[3:29:34] give my family more attention than I did
[3:29:38] so that is a mistake I made the question
[3:29:41] you ask me is how did you find the
[3:29:45] balance um if I knew I would tell you
[3:29:49] you need to convince yourself based on
[3:29:53] your PRI
[3:29:54] priorities things are much better for me
[3:29:57] today because if you want to know the
[3:30:00] truth in the last 30 years of my life I
[3:30:03] don't sign check I never sign check in
[3:30:05] CoStar so if I can delegate check
[3:30:07] signing there's nothing I cannot
[3:30:10] delegate many self-made people like to
[3:30:13] sign all the checks to make sure nobody
[3:30:16] takes the money but I'm saying in the
[3:30:18] last 30 years I don't sign check in in
[3:30:20] my company there we have more than five
[3:30:23] signatories to account but two people
[3:30:26] must must sign okay so I've delegated
[3:30:29] that job and if I can delegate that I
[3:30:31] can delegate others that's why I can be
[3:30:34] here today I've never called office you
[3:30:37] know in the last one week but things are
[3:30:40] working and running in aut autop parot
[3:30:43] but it's not easy to get there because
[3:30:45] it takes a lot of energy it is part of
[3:30:48] those things I build I did that affected
[3:30:51] my family and some of the things that
[3:30:53] grew up this institution today that I I
[3:30:56] don't need to be there for it to run so
[3:30:59] I have more time today to go for
[3:31:02] evangelism but I never stopped
[3:31:04] evangelising from beginning because it
[3:31:07] was my beginning of my life so but a lot
[3:31:11] of people were actually were
[3:31:14] surprised are you not
[3:31:16] afraid Lagos of 22 million people that
[3:31:20] somebody could put a gun in your head in
[3:31:22] that street that is the least thing that
[3:31:25] c in my mind if God asked me to go to
[3:31:29] Afghanistan today to go and preach
[3:31:31] that's the best place I need to be in
[3:31:33] the face of the Earth amen when I am in
[3:31:36] the mission field in the course of work
[3:31:38] of God no fear pass passed through my
[3:31:41] mind
[3:31:42] nothing I do a whole lot of things to
[3:31:45] get people's attention sometime I'm
[3:31:48] going out on Saturday to go and preach I
[3:31:50] ride on my
[3:31:52] motorbike
[3:31:54] usually government officially attach two
[3:31:57] senior police officers with me I have
[3:31:59] about four police people that work with
[3:32:02] me or guide me when I'm traveling but
[3:32:05] when I'm going evangelism I'm not going
[3:32:06] with any police I go on my own actually
[3:32:12] where I was where they took my my video
[3:32:15] I didn't know who spotted me I was in a
[3:32:16] fish
[3:32:17] market I was in a fish market in in some
[3:32:21] ruler area and I come with my bike
[3:32:24] sometime because I I used to do
[3:32:26] acrobatic I have big bike then I use
[3:32:29] that bike to gather crowd people come to
[3:32:32] watch my crown I set up my equipment
[3:32:35] gospel has started and I preach to the
[3:32:38] people pray for them tell take some
[3:32:41] people who made their commitment to
[3:32:43] church and baptized them on the weekend
[3:32:46] and some of them have become you know
[3:32:47] Christians and still remain in faith so
[3:32:50] I still go for my evangelism so it's not
[3:32:53] a classroom walk actually any s of day
[3:32:57] that I am in Legos and I have no
[3:32:59] speaking engagement is my evangelism
[3:33:02] time so we have an evangelism group in
[3:33:05] our church we go to prison to preach we
[3:33:07] go to different places you know to to do
[3:33:10] that and then we We join one person will
[3:33:14] speak this weekend the other person we
[3:33:15] do we do that almost every Saturday
[3:33:18] because that's how to not only grow the
[3:33:21] church evangelism is like also
[3:33:23] systematic prospecting but Braham say if
[3:33:26] advertisement works in the natural it
[3:33:29] also will work in the spiritual and we
[3:33:31] are God's advertisement agents so but
[3:33:34] what we need to tell people is not to
[3:33:36] oversell the product is to let them test
[3:33:40] the product because a good product will
[3:33:42] sell itself tell him take this and put
[3:33:45] it and see whether it
[3:33:46] work so if the person can believe and
[3:33:50] put this into he will find out that it
[3:33:52] works because one is that I am the man
[3:33:54] Advertiser because I tell you it works
[3:33:56] for me and if this work for me I believe
[3:33:59] it will work for you so uh I would tell
[3:34:03] a young man to totally sell sold out to
[3:34:07] the word of God that's the advice I will
[3:34:09] give don't come to this thing with
[3:34:12] double mind let me give it a try if it
[3:34:15] doesn't work I go you've seen it work
[3:34:18] for many other people you will tell
[3:34:20] yourself I am the only person he going
[3:34:22] to work for if it doesn't work for
[3:34:24] another person I will be the next person
[3:34:26] it work for this stories we had about
[3:34:29] brother Braham is not a tell they are
[3:34:32] testimonies of it we found people who
[3:34:35] met Christ and God transformed their
[3:34:37] life if you are still doubting whether
[3:34:40] God can take a beggar and make him a
[3:34:43] king there's one standing before you so
[3:34:46] you can say if God can do this with
[3:34:48] cosmas he can do that with you there's
[3:34:50] nothing that make me
[3:34:53] extraordinary I only believe God and he
[3:34:56] see God saw he could trust me with money
[3:35:00] it's it's not so much of my hard work my
[3:35:02] hard work is important but if you can
[3:35:05] walk as many hard as you can walk unless
[3:35:08] God bless that effort it's intility
[3:35:12] whatever effort you are making so we
[3:35:14] must you do the hard work but your faith
[3:35:18] is in the god of Miracle who can take
[3:35:22] five rows of bread and fed 5,000 so for
[3:35:27] me that thing that happened in the Bible
[3:35:29] days is not a story anymore because I've
[3:35:32] seen God use the same Quantum power
[3:35:37] to change the things I'm doing on on a
[3:35:40] daily basis and see the thing grow like
[3:35:44] like at like
[3:35:46] instantly but many time it has been
[3:35:50] gradually so when a miracle happen you
[3:35:53] know this is something you cannot
[3:35:56] explain you know sometime I don't I I I
[3:36:00] I I hesitate to give some certain
[3:36:04] testimonies and the reason why he said
[3:36:06] to give it
[3:36:08] is will that become s exaltation how
[3:36:12] would the people look at it can they
[3:36:14] contend it because even Jesus said I
[3:36:16] have many things to say unto you but you
[3:36:19] cannot bear them now so you wait for the
[3:36:21] season and
[3:36:23] opportunity but I've seen God do things
[3:36:28] that only make me
[3:36:32] cry but all of those things is training
[3:36:36] like I told people brother BR used to go
[3:36:38] and hunt and people thought that that
[3:36:40] hunting was just for for casual movement
[3:36:44] God also trained him during hunting
[3:36:47] because he will hear a voice I said
[3:36:50] there's a squirrel you shut that
[3:36:52] squirrel at the right eye he will shut
[3:36:54] that squirrel at the right eye you know
[3:36:56] how tiny small squ is so when he's in
[3:36:59] the P pit the same voice spoke to him no
[3:37:02] matter how bad that disease is that to
[3:37:06] is he will he will say it because it's a
[3:37:08] training God used it things to train you
[3:37:12] before he will exhibit you so when you
[3:37:14] talk about that thing you talk from an
[3:37:16] informed position because you have
[3:37:19] experience Christianity is nothing if
[3:37:22] you don't have experience it's about
[3:37:25] experience with the reising Jesus Christ
[3:37:29] so you are not talking intellectually
[3:37:31] you are not telling people this person
[3:37:33] say this story this person said this
[3:37:35] story you talk like a child that tell
[3:37:39] their mother I want God with fresh you
[3:37:42] know you have experienced
[3:37:44] this nobody can talk me out of this
[3:37:48] thing because there are things I have
[3:37:51] seen and I
[3:37:53] knew no human being could have done that
[3:37:58] and it's not an effort of any human
[3:38:00] being a miracle are things that are
[3:38:03] incredible because there's no scientific
[3:38:06] proof how leg will grow there's no
[3:38:09] injection you give somebody for the leg
[3:38:11] to grow if you have seen a short leg
[3:38:14] grow instantly in your friend you can't
[3:38:18] the only way you can explain it is to
[3:38:19] say it's a miracle is that correct okay
[3:38:25] so if you can
[3:38:28] take a product that's like say what
[3:38:32] $10,000 and sell it in one day for
[3:38:37] $100,000 you will know it's a miracle
[3:38:42] it's not it's not that that product has
[3:38:45] higher value than it is but there is
[3:38:47] something that make that happen and you
[3:38:50] collect the cash it become real cash not
[3:38:53] fake money real money so you when you
[3:38:57] talk about Miracle you say you know it
[3:39:00] but you know we many of us talk about
[3:39:05] wealth transfer the wealth of the
[3:39:07] Gentiles to the hand of the Believers is
[3:39:10] a tell to a lot of people but people
[3:39:12] like me have witnessed it have witnessed
[3:39:15] well transfer because it's instantly
[3:39:17] it's not that one is not about working
[3:39:20] hard and money coming one day God just
[3:39:23] closed one door and move the thing here
[3:39:25] and the door close I witness it but as
[3:39:27] time progress I'll give those testimony
[3:39:30] in a very plain way where people can
[3:39:32] appreciate it thank you thank you
[3:39:34] brother gmas can I have
[3:39:37] another question
[3:39:43] ask
[3:39:47] ask we see we see what the time looks
[3:39:51] like all right can I have another
[3:39:53] person please if you could stand
[3:40:03] here
[3:40:08] welome what is your question
[3:40:10] I am is this microphone
[3:40:13] on okay okay my name is Andrew Baka and
[3:40:16] I Fellowship from this
[3:40:18] church I am an economics student okay
[3:40:22] economics teaches us principles of
[3:40:26] financial management yes tells us
[3:40:31] to to delay to pay
[3:40:34] vendors V again the last statement it
[3:40:37] teaches us to delay pay vendors that's
[3:40:42] correct or workers that's correct but
[3:40:46] the Bible teaches
[3:40:48] us to pay
[3:40:50] workers before the the sweat dries
[3:40:54] that's correct
[3:40:56] M another thing is that you talked
[3:41:01] about
[3:41:03] you paying yourself last and less that's
[3:41:08] right and paying less and paying well
[3:41:12] the workers that's
[3:41:14] correct I am impressed by that thank you
[3:41:17] and yesterday and the other day when I
[3:41:19] was in the meetings I took the
[3:41:22] principles of God that I'm going to
[3:41:24] follow them in my businesses thank you
[3:41:27] the one I'm going to
[3:41:29] start and those ones I'm transacting now
[3:41:32] yeah my question
[3:41:36] is how how will drive by balance these
[3:41:41] principles economic principles and godly
[3:41:44] principles because keeping money with me
[3:41:47] for some time before I pay it sure is
[3:41:49] also good sure God bless you thank you
[3:41:52] very much very valid question I like
[3:41:55] questions like this that means people
[3:41:57] are
[3:41:59] thinking like I said there's no middle
[3:42:03] way something has to give way something
[3:42:06] has to pay the
[3:42:08] price I have quarrel with my financial
[3:42:13] controller and I told
[3:42:20] him you have gone to
[3:42:24] school you we hire you to manage
[3:42:28] finances for
[3:42:30] us and I know they've taught you certain
[3:42:32] things in
[3:42:34] school but the principle that rule in my
[3:42:37] company is Bible principle
[3:42:42] you have to pay our
[3:42:45] vendors on agreed date if you want to
[3:42:49] negotiate you must negotiate up front
[3:42:54] not
[3:42:55] letter you can't and if you tell
[3:42:58] somebody you will pay him on the 30th of
[3:43:01] every month please pay him on the 25th
[3:43:05] or on the 28th if you pay on the 31st if
[3:43:10] you pay on the first or second I'll fire
[3:43:15] you I told him to commit in writing for
[3:43:21] me that we will not miss payment debt by
[3:43:26] one day because my understanding based
[3:43:30] on
[3:43:31] Bible is to exceed people's
[3:43:37] expectation and it work like a magic if
[3:43:40] you understand it the Bible Way is the
[3:43:42] only way the life to go people think the
[3:43:46] natural things that taught in the school
[3:43:49] is the way to go I follow Bible
[3:43:53] principle so a lot of people cannot
[3:44:00] understand our campign is a Nigerian
[3:44:05] company is not owned by Japanese it's
[3:44:08] not owned by
[3:44:10] America and the I don't know how many
[3:44:14] multinational organization borrow money
[3:44:18] on a negative
[3:44:19] pled I don't know how many people in my
[3:44:23] country that Standard chattered Bank can
[3:44:26] Lear money without
[3:44:28] corer I didn't pick it on the street
[3:44:31] it's a life it's a prayer point that I
[3:44:34] made and I walk towards it you know the
[3:44:37] Magic The Magic is that
[3:44:40] I will tell
[3:44:41] you listen you better take my word for
[3:44:46] it we are the best people you can do
[3:44:49] business
[3:44:50] with forget about
[3:44:53] agreement if we shake hands my shaking
[3:44:56] hands with you is greater than anything
[3:44:59] and I started applying that
[3:45:02] principle that even when I am sure I
[3:45:06] will be able to pay
[3:45:08] you on 30th of the month I would on the
[3:45:13] 15th of the month I will tell you the
[3:45:15] only time I can be able to pay you is on
[3:45:17] the
[3:45:19] 31st in
[3:45:21] agreement so that if I pay you by 17th
[3:45:24] you are happy if I pay you by 25 you are
[3:45:26] happy if I pay you by 28 you are happy
[3:45:29] because it's an improvement but nothing
[3:45:31] will make it exceed so when people want
[3:45:35] to do business with me I tell you I do
[3:45:39] business with all my business partner on
[3:45:42] open account because the best credit you
[3:45:45] will get is not bank loan the best
[3:45:48] credit you will get is what we call
[3:45:50] suppliers credit because it's without
[3:45:54] Interest Bank money has interest
[3:45:57] Saturday Sunday when I give you this
[3:46:00] water to
[3:46:01] sell without collecting money it's money
[3:46:04] that I give you but it's in a
[3:46:07] value are you following what I'm saying
[3:46:10] if this water is selling maybe $1 and I
[3:46:14] gave it to you I've given you $1 credit
[3:46:16] it's money that I gave you so if I give
[3:46:19] you 10 of it I've given you $10 if I
[3:46:21] give you 1,000 of it I've given you
[3:46:23] $1,000 and because I trust you so
[3:46:27] suppliers credit is the best credit you
[3:46:29] can get if Bank give me money to buy
[3:46:32] this 1,000 there's interest on it every
[3:46:34] day counting on a month and in a year
[3:46:37] but when a supplier give it to you he
[3:46:40] didn't tach value to it but he need to
[3:46:42] agree when to pay him nothing should
[3:46:44] make you not to pay on that
[3:46:46] day so when people now want to do
[3:46:50] business with me I I give them reference
[3:46:53] get a reference from this person get
[3:46:55] reference from this person one of the
[3:46:57] person wrote a Japanese to take a
[3:47:00] reference of our company the Japanese
[3:47:02] replied and said c charish money payment
[3:47:05] arrive like Japanese Express train
[3:47:08] called shin caner
[3:47:10] the shank shansen train means one minute
[3:47:14] to the time you will not find it but
[3:47:16] exactly to the time is there on dot you
[3:47:18] never miss one
[3:47:20] minute and people we have established
[3:47:23] this
[3:47:24] reputation so companies that are 200
[3:47:27] years old give me credit people say
[3:47:30] Chinese doesn't give anybody credit
[3:47:32] anybody that do business with Chinese
[3:47:33] you pay
[3:47:35] 30% uh deposit for production when it
[3:47:38] finish you pay back balance I enjoy 120
[3:47:41] days payment t with Chinese I don't make
[3:47:45] deposit they produce Goods cheap it and
[3:47:47] wait for 120 days to get their money but
[3:47:50] it cannot
[3:47:52] be5 days rather it can be 110 days or it
[3:47:56] can be 90 days but it will never exceed
[3:47:59] so we keep this record on a consistent
[3:48:01] basis and I have use this record to work
[3:48:05] with BMW they ship me cash on open
[3:48:08] account Ford Moto company ship me car on
[3:48:11] open account I used this to break all my
[3:48:15] suppliers before we start I tell you
[3:48:17] this is our conditions of payment and
[3:48:20] you can take reference so we have a pool
[3:48:22] of resources and
[3:48:25] people what is important is that we
[3:48:28] manage these resources to make sure
[3:48:30] every obligations are made on the due
[3:48:35] date no compromising and the person in
[3:48:39] charge I tell him if you fail to meet
[3:48:42] obligation on a due days you give me
[3:48:44] your resignation that's the system we
[3:48:46] run in cies and we have worked with this
[3:48:49] and the pays off so we
[3:48:52] bank if if we're working with you as a
[3:48:55] bank if you make us angry we write you
[3:48:57] one check and we will not work with you
[3:48:59] we pay you before we start checking
[3:49:01] whether you overcharge us interest we
[3:49:03] pay you Bank asked me why do you do that
[3:49:05] I said because different people will
[3:49:08] start quaring the bank become a goose to
[3:49:12] to delay their payment no I learned some
[3:49:16] of these principles this principle that
[3:49:18] I now from
[3:49:20] Japanese even before I rent it from the
[3:49:23] the Japanese make commitment with you
[3:49:26] before the fundamentalist start
[3:49:28] committing suicide if they come keep
[3:49:32] obligation they take their life a man I
[3:49:35] met his name is machita he has gone to
[3:49:38] dinner with me he wrote a note and tell
[3:49:41] the people he so sorry that he
[3:49:43] disappointed them and that he a failure
[3:49:46] put their
[3:49:48] life kill kill himself the Japanese have
[3:49:51] been committing suicide before fundament
[3:49:54] you know religious fundamentalist start
[3:49:57] killing themselves if they make a
[3:49:59] promise to you that's why religion is
[3:50:02] too strong difficult to penetrate in
[3:50:04] Japan because everything you are
[3:50:05] teaching in religion is like their
[3:50:07] normal standard life so they ask you
[3:50:10] what more are you the only thing that
[3:50:12] they drink their beer in the evening so
[3:50:14] what more are you teaching that they are
[3:50:15] not doing so they all this Christianity
[3:50:18] that is based on do this you become a
[3:50:20] Christian is being a way of living they
[3:50:22] teach people politeness they teach
[3:50:24] people hard work they teach people you
[3:50:27] know um courtesy you know you you don't
[3:50:31] go to toilet and mess it up you need to
[3:50:33] clean it after you did so that another
[3:50:35] person going there will see it in
[3:50:36] perfect condition they don't go to
[3:50:38] National s and eat things and throw away
[3:50:40] they pick it up anywhere they are it's a
[3:50:43] culture so the this culture make it
[3:50:46] difficult that many religion cannot
[3:50:48] because things religion teaches people
[3:50:50] what to
[3:50:52] do to make you qualify but those things
[3:50:55] you want to teach theman is already
[3:50:57] doing so they felt there's no need for
[3:51:00] your
[3:51:01] religion the point I'm trying to make is
[3:51:03] that Christians should live beyond what
[3:51:06] the natural law did
[3:51:10] many people didn't know the meaning of
[3:51:13] the word
[3:51:15] holy if you ask any Jewish laby the word
[3:51:21] holy means
[3:51:23] one
[3:51:25] people don't have a revelation but
[3:51:28] Abraham teaches that there's only one
[3:51:32] God why we call God holy is because he's
[3:51:36] authentic and is one the word holy means
[3:51:40] one I am God there's no other one beside
[3:51:44] me that's why you cannot tell any Jew
[3:51:47] about three persons in one God so the
[3:51:52] correct thing is that you must
[3:51:54] understand that 2:00 is
[3:51:58] 2:00 anywhere in the world there's no
[3:52:01] Nigerian 2:00 and and Uganda 2:00 it is
[3:52:06] 2:00 if you made a promise keep it and
[3:52:09] don't ever oversell your
[3:52:12] compan but overd deliver if you can and
[3:52:15] that's what the prophet taught us on the
[3:52:19] message let your life so shine
[3:52:24] 1961 September 3rd find it there let us
[3:52:29] not oversell Christ but let us be the
[3:52:33] advertisement board of him amen by the
[3:52:36] things we do yes amen uh another
[3:52:39] question
[3:52:43] please yes I want to thank you so much
[3:52:46] for coming my name is
[3:52:49] Ivan I have two main questions which I
[3:52:51] want to be so brief about my first
[3:52:54] question is about uh
[3:52:55] procrastination I'm sure everyone is a
[3:52:58] victim of procrastination that's correct
[3:53:00] people have procrastinated in the past
[3:53:02] others are procrastinating even today
[3:53:04] and there are few people who are going
[3:53:06] to procrastinate a few things they're
[3:53:08] supposed to do
[3:53:09] both in the things of God and in
[3:53:11] business sure and so uh I would want you
[3:53:15] to help us CU it looks like you have
[3:53:17] conquered that
[3:53:19] procrastination and you would also want
[3:53:21] to overcome it it's possible to overcome
[3:53:25] it
[3:53:27] psychologists have
[3:53:30] discovered that one of the greatest
[3:53:33] problem of human being like you are
[3:53:34] saying is
[3:53:37] procrastination um
[3:53:42] procrastination comes from
[3:53:45] Fear you keep
[3:53:47] on
[3:53:49] thinking I am not
[3:53:52] qualified is not yet the
[3:53:55] time I'll be taking a risk let me get
[3:53:59] everything right before I start and you
[3:54:02] never
[3:54:03] start is the coping
[3:54:06] mechanism that create that problem
[3:54:09] and that's why I said desire decision
[3:54:13] and
[3:54:15] determination this determination many
[3:54:18] time
[3:54:19] is like brother Braham
[3:54:22] said josua when he had the word of God
[3:54:26] for it he became
[3:54:29] less shake the word less to be less is
[3:54:33] to throw caution on the wind that means
[3:54:36] I don't care anymore whatever happened
[3:54:38] from this point point
[3:54:39] on if you continue to procrastinate you
[3:54:42] never amount to anything in life because
[3:54:44] there are good reason why you keep on
[3:54:47] saying I will do it tomorrow and by the
[3:54:49] time you are getting tomorrow you will
[3:54:51] do it next tomorrow and you never get it
[3:54:53] done and that is where you need to take
[3:54:57] a step of faith if I perish I perish you
[3:55:01] need to get to that point to said I
[3:55:03] think I we have been in this mountain
[3:55:05] too long look at it
[3:55:10] uh those
[3:55:13] rappers who got to that point to make
[3:55:17] that decision there were famine it was
[3:55:20] such a famine that was so
[3:55:23] horrible that people begin to eat their
[3:55:26] children you bring your children today
[3:55:28] we cook and eat tomorrow you bring I
[3:55:29] bring your own a head of an axe was
[3:55:33] selling for 3,600 sa just ahead of an
[3:55:37] ass till the people met the king the
[3:55:39] king said am I God because a woman they
[3:55:42] have eat his own child The Other Woman
[3:55:43] refused to bring his own child then he
[3:55:45] has to report to the king it was the
[3:55:47] terrible F but three lepers or four
[3:55:51] lepers made up their
[3:55:54] mind why do we stay here and
[3:55:58] die we have a judgment delay is a
[3:56:01] Justice delay if we stay here if we
[3:56:04] don't die today we die tomorrow so why
[3:56:06] do we stay here and die will go to the
[3:56:09] enemy's Camp it's only one dead that is
[3:56:11] going to fess us we don't have two Life
[3:56:13] to Live
[3:56:14] oh then theonomy 111 came to
[3:56:19] pass the Lord God of your
[3:56:26] father make you a thousand time than you
[3:56:29] are four lepers were
[3:56:31] walking each St they moving people were
[3:56:34] hearing 4,000 Horsemen
[3:56:37] coming there are Le but God multiplied
[3:56:41] their foot to 4,000 and the people
[3:56:45] ran left all the gold left all the food
[3:56:49] everything and the word of the Lord that
[3:56:53] again show you when a true Prophet gave
[3:56:57] a prophecy you hang your soul on it
[3:57:01] amen so I encourage Christians to stop
[3:57:05] procrastination it's not godly
[3:57:07] procrastination
[3:57:09] is expression of fear entertaining fear
[3:57:13] because people are going to laugh at me
[3:57:17] actually if you want to be successful
[3:57:19] you must be willing to be laughed at
[3:57:21] it's part of the it's part of the secret
[3:57:23] of being
[3:57:24] successful I think I'm going to allow
[3:57:26] two two more people any two more people
[3:57:29] no okay so you can bring your question
[3:57:32] and then lastly this question it's more
[3:57:34] of a it's more of a simple story that it
[3:57:37] changed the way I view very many things
[3:57:40] there was a father and a son who went
[3:57:42] for camping then when they raised their
[3:57:45] tent they slept so in the middle of the
[3:57:48] night the father woke up the son and
[3:57:51] said wake up so he told him to look up
[3:57:53] when he looked up the father asked him
[3:57:56] what do you see he said I sister stars
[3:57:59] then the father asked him what does that
[3:58:01] mean he started to explain astrology
[3:58:04] astronomy space and the father slapped
[3:58:07] him
[3:58:09] and I know many people could be
[3:58:11] wondering why why did the father slap
[3:58:13] him yet he was right sure so the father
[3:58:15] told him I slapped you because this if
[3:58:20] you're seeing the Stars that's true it
[3:58:22] means they have stolen our
[3:58:24] tent that it means what they have stolen
[3:58:27] the tent okay sure because when they
[3:58:29] slept down they raised their tent they
[3:58:32] were not seeing the Stars that's correct
[3:58:34] so when the father woke him up in the
[3:58:36] middle of the night and asked him what
[3:58:37] do you see he said saw the stars then
[3:58:39] when the father asked him what does it
[3:58:41] mean the father expected him to be as
[3:58:43] simple as they have stolen our tent
[3:58:46] because when we slept we were not seeing
[3:58:48] the Stars the tent had covered us that's
[3:58:50] correct and so it changed the way I view
[3:58:54] very many things because I try to relate
[3:58:57] it in like the things School have school
[3:59:00] has taught us and very many things we
[3:59:03] have gone through in this life that are
[3:59:06] too many and then we fail to use the
[3:59:10] basic knowledge the basic understanding
[3:59:12] sure now I believe like me there are
[3:59:15] many things that I studied in school
[3:59:17] that I believe are not so necessary
[3:59:20] absolutely if you have read if you read
[3:59:22] the book of Rich Dad Poor Dad the one of
[3:59:25] the the guy asked the the teacher theer
[3:59:28] this things you are teaching me will I
[3:59:29] use it the man said said so why are you
[3:59:32] teaching it to me he says in government
[3:59:33] uh collect columns there are many things
[3:59:36] they taught you in school that is
[3:59:38] absolutely unnecessary but they spend
[3:59:41] time and and somebody look at it and
[3:59:43] tell you you above average who dare him
[3:59:45] say you above you are below or above
[3:59:47] average so my main question was if
[3:59:50] someone has accumulated all this
[3:59:52] information that is not necessary mixed
[3:59:55] together with the information that is
[3:59:57] necessary how can you get to sa the
[3:59:59] important things then you leave the ones
[4:00:02] that are not
[4:00:03] important okay so that's the reason why
[4:00:06] we are here the reason why we are here
[4:00:09] is to focus on the things that are
[4:00:11] important and leave those things that
[4:00:14] are not important because there are too
[4:00:15] many things so many knowledge they gave
[4:00:18] us in school pump all of those things in
[4:00:21] our mind that are not really useful for
[4:00:24] us so the most important thing is
[4:00:27] important in life is to
[4:00:31] um know who your God is and live a life
[4:00:36] that is impactful for people people if
[4:00:39] you focus on those things you will help
[4:00:42] you to that's why ask me today who is
[4:00:46] the the best soccer player in the world
[4:00:49] I don't know how there are children you
[4:00:52] ask now they will tell you how much l
[4:00:54] earn tell you how
[4:00:55] much how how does those things
[4:00:57] contribute to my to my
[4:01:01] value when I was young my mother told me
[4:01:06] people who watch television never appear
[4:01:08] in
[4:01:10] television I should appear in television
[4:01:13] I should not watch television and I
[4:01:15] followed my mother instruction today
[4:01:18] people go to television to watch me but
[4:01:20] I don't watch the things that is in the
[4:01:22] television so please these are things
[4:01:25] that are value if you continue to watch
[4:01:27] television if you continue to read with
[4:01:29] all these things they not to catch your
[4:01:30] attention you need say don't go away
[4:01:32] another one is coming you spend all your
[4:01:35] time in it is it important how has there
[4:01:38] contributed to your life to take you
[4:01:40] from point A to point B and that's why I
[4:01:43] say something is going to give
[4:01:45] way a brother that's here just left what
[4:01:48] do they teach you in economics
[4:01:50] opportunity
[4:01:52] C what do you thread off what is most
[4:01:56] important for you what do you want to
[4:01:58] leave for the other things that means
[4:02:01] something to you is the thread off that
[4:02:03] is the price you pay for the real thing
[4:02:05] that you want I didn't go to University
[4:02:08] to learn economics but I learn home
[4:02:10] economics in that little way it helped
[4:02:13] me to guide my thought so that's why I
[4:02:17] tell you when somebody is talking to me
[4:02:20] he doesn't know the way my mind is
[4:02:21] working everything is saying I'm taking
[4:02:24] him to put him in those five things I
[4:02:26] wrote and see whether there's a way he
[4:02:29] can help me get there if I can't find
[4:02:31] him collaborating with any of those
[4:02:33] things is a distraction I cut him off
[4:02:36] did you see how my mind work so as a man
[4:02:39] think it in his own heart that's how he
[4:02:41] eat so I I grew up
[4:02:45] believing that I don't have competition
[4:02:49] people are afraid about competition but
[4:02:51] my philosophy is that the only person
[4:02:54] that can compete with me is a man who
[4:02:56] think exactly the way I'm thinking so if
[4:02:58] you can't think like me we are not
[4:03:00] competing for anything
[4:03:02] yeah well thank you thank you brother
[4:03:05] Ivan thank you uh Dr cosmas I uh
[4:03:08] I'll just say there's one person here uh
[4:03:12] called

[4:05:59] you bring it to
[4:06:00] me you went out the mother said don't

[4:07:02] you follow the money into the

[4:07:12] god did you see about
[4:07:16] management all the others money that he

[4:07:25] money I said you can't destroy my asset
[4:07:28] the father said you made this
[4:07:30] money nothing is given to you until you
[4:07:34] learn how to
[4:07:35] manage start small
[4:07:39] build small once you can have something
[4:07:43] substantial that is tangible you can
[4:07:46] show the door and opportunities are open
[4:07:50] amen but you need to make that sacrifice
[4:07:53] of early beginning to create something
[4:07:56] from nothing because God make you a
[4:07:59] Creator and you have power to create
[4:08:03] amen but if you like to get everything
[4:08:06] we Christians
[4:08:09] God give us so many things in credit but
[4:08:14] he still want us to end it you are not
[4:08:17] holy because you say You Are Holy but
[4:08:19] God credited Holiness to you but he
[4:08:22] wants you to earn it that's why I said
[4:08:24] walk out your salvation with fear and
[4:08:27] trembling but some people want to just
[4:08:30] say I am a righteous man I am a
[4:08:31] righteous man and you live in your
[4:08:32] fornication you live in all your this no
[4:08:35] you need to hold yourself accountable to
[4:08:38] become that thing you are confessing
[4:08:42] amen God trusted you and put it in
[4:08:45] credit before you and I ask you ear it m
[4:08:49] he didn't say when you end it I'll give
[4:08:51] it to you but he said I put it on credit
[4:08:54] for you but ear it yes so you need to
[4:08:56] that's why you need to break your human
[4:08:58] Spirit go all the way you know you can't
[4:09:02] just sit back and said God make me
[4:09:04] righteous and you live like the rest of
[4:09:06] the world like sinner no that means you
[4:09:09] have taken a higher responsibility
[4:09:12] you've started where you used to go you
[4:09:15] stop going there things you need to do
[4:09:17] you stop doing them and then you see
[4:09:19] that reality that promise become a
[4:09:21] reality in your life let us pray Amen in
