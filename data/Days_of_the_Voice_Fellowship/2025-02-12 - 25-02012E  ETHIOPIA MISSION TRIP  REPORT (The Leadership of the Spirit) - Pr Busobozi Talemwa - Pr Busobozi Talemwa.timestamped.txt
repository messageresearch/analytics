[55:41] our greetings to you from here at
[55:44] dvf amen um brother if you can give me
[55:47] the next
[55:49] slide okay uh all right now here this
[55:52] first picture here uh brother Isaac you
[55:55] you you you have that you got that okay
[55:58] that first picture there is um maybe you
[56:01] would need to switch off these lights
[56:02] here uh I don't know can they be
[56:04] switched off for now and then you can
[56:06] put them on
[56:09] afterwards okay and then this
[56:13] one ah okay it's now it's now good so uh
[56:18] this picture here I know it's not very
[56:19] clear there for you who are here in the
[56:22] church uh but um if you see there are
[56:25] four gentlemen there this is 7 years ago
[56:27] this is 7 years ago on the extreme left
[56:30] is brother Ephraim that is me and then
[56:33] this is Brother K mesan and that is
[56:36] brother Timothy brother Timothy was at
[56:38] the time a brother from Kenya um and who
[56:42] had come to Ethiopia to work as an
[56:44] expatriate and he was um um at at the
[56:47] time 7 years ago uh managing or rather
[56:52] do I say managing
[56:54] or um for for lack of better word I can
[56:57] use that he was managing one of the
[56:59] factories there he was the engineer uh
[57:01] he was in charge of that factory a
[57:03] multinational uh company and he happened
[57:07] to to you know be working with this
[57:09] brother tesan that brother in the middle
[57:12] or rather on the other side 1 two three
[57:16] that brother tesan his name is tesan so
[57:18] he was working with him at the time and
[57:20] that brother uh was under him he was
[57:23] working with him in the same company but
[57:24] he was under him so that brother tesan
[57:26] believed the message um through the
[57:29] testimony of brother Tim and brother Tim
[57:31] over there brought him to to add Ababa
[57:34] where at the time I was the pastor of
[57:36] the church which was just starting out I
[57:38] think by that time we were about um 3
[57:40] four 5 years I can I cannot recall so um
[57:45] so brother team would you know from aasa
[57:47] to Addis it's about 4 hours so brother
[57:49] team would travel all the way from Addis
[57:52] from aasa to come to Addis and he did
[57:54] that for a long time
[57:56] and he brought brother tesan we baptized
[57:59] brother tesan in in Adis Ababa um so but
[58:05] that was the only believer apart from
[58:07] the family of brother Tim brother tesan
[58:10] was the only believer in aasa at that
[58:12] time in the city of aasa at that time of
[58:15] this message I want you to imagine that
[58:18] so um so but you know when after a while
[58:23] but the team invited us he told me if
[58:24] you could come and visit us so so we
[58:26] went to visit them I would go many times
[58:28] with different Brothers but on this
[58:30] particular picture I had gone with
[58:32] brother brother ephra and of course to
[58:34] help me interpret when when whenever we
[58:36] are ministering with other people I see
[58:39] brother Ephraim was very young there I
[58:41] don't know about myself of course 7
[58:42] years ago I was also younger than I am
[58:44] now can I have the next
[58:47] picture okay all right so if you just
[58:50] keep the pictures on and then just keep
[58:52] giving me the next one so right there
[58:54] you have this is 7 years ago and this
[58:57] picture here in particular I thought I
[58:59] should share this because on this trip 7
[59:02] years later I traveled with Brother Gary
[59:04] Walker but on this picture seven years
[59:07] ago you see right there brother Gary
[59:10] Walker and his wife can you see that
[59:13] Brother Gary walk and his wife had
[59:14] visited Us in in the church in Adis
[59:17] Ababa having heard for a few years about
[59:19] what the Lord was doing in Ethiopia so
[59:21] he had come to visit us on the extreme
[59:24] left the here is Sister Bo
[59:26] carrying the baby of Sister Sister yodit
[59:29] at that time sister bues was
[59:31] just staying with sister yodit but now
[59:34] she's also a married a married sister
[59:36] these all people are now bigger and of
[59:38] course more more mature and married and
[59:41] so right there sister Deborah Walker the
[59:43] one who wrote that book uh that we were
[59:45] reading in the interview Brother Gary
[59:47] Walker brother gir there is the wife
[59:49] husband to Sister yodit then that is
[59:52] myself with the blue coat on and then
[59:54] brother Ephraim I don't know whether you
[59:55] can see him back there and then brother
[59:59] ased and then brother morgus so now
[1:00:01] these are are some of the brothers the
[1:00:04] ministering brothers that we had at the
[1:00:06] time um when we the church was just
[1:00:08] beginning at that time I I I think as I
[1:00:11] said 7 years ago the church was about I
[1:00:13] think three or 4 years old so this
[1:00:17] picture is so significant because 7
[1:00:19] years after this I now went you can see
[1:00:23] all these brothers are preaching now all
[1:00:25] of them are preaching this message all
[1:00:26] of them are preaching this message and
[1:00:29] uh brother Ephraim back there he was the
[1:00:31] youngest of all of them as you can see
[1:00:32] it's even in the back he was the
[1:00:35] youngest of all of them but as you are
[1:00:36] going to see in the pictures I'm going
[1:00:38] to show you God has really really used
[1:00:40] him in such a special way can I have the
[1:00:42] the next
[1:00:43] picture Okay so that is uh now myself
[1:00:46] and brother Ephraim this is still seven
[1:00:48] years ago um um you know with his family
[1:00:53] right in the middle there is brother
[1:00:55] brother Salam who married the that
[1:00:57] sister next sister Betty who is the wife
[1:01:01] of B Salam the the the the sister to
[1:01:05] brother Ephraim I don't know whether I
[1:01:06] said that right so then over there the
[1:01:09] extreme right is the mother of U brother
[1:01:12] Ephraim so here we were at their home
[1:01:13] you know we're like family you know so
[1:01:15] we used many times to go visit them
[1:01:18] after they had received the message and
[1:01:19] we used to have a lot of fellowship at
[1:01:21] that time I think they were already
[1:01:22] married uh sister Betty and brother
[1:01:24] Salam can I have the the next
[1:01:27] picture okay now through the years this
[1:01:29] is
[1:01:30] 2019 um you see at this time I remember
[1:01:33] I I I had taken a picture and I I was
[1:01:35] holding my Bible so Aphra uh sent me
[1:01:38] this this picture or I don't remember
[1:01:40] was it that he sent it to me or he took
[1:01:42] it when I was there so he held his Bible
[1:01:45] and so I looked at him I don't know
[1:01:47] whether he remembers that and I told him
[1:01:49] ephra you look just like me in that
[1:01:51] picture you are going to preach this
[1:01:52] message he said amen and I wanted to see
[1:01:56] 2025 I don't know how many years later

[1:05:57] listened and and they received the word
[1:05:59] gladly and you know uh Pastor ephra was
[1:06:01] telling me you know many of them were
[1:06:02] fearing and but U having received these
[1:06:06] meetings and these Services you know
[1:06:08] they received boldness they received
[1:06:10] boldness actually I heard from him was
[1:06:12] it today he said many of them are now
[1:06:15] going out to preach with
[1:06:17] fire let me have the next picture that's
[1:06:19] that's Pastor ephra interpreting for me
[1:06:21] okay he interpreted for us all the
[1:06:22] services uh let us have the next picture
[1:06:25] so this this is brother brother Gary he
[1:06:27] preached the next three services uh and
[1:06:30] he preached really very wonderful uh God
[1:06:32] led him in such a way that he exactly
[1:06:34] touched what the people the problem of
[1:06:36] the people you remember the service he
[1:06:38] preached for us here on Wednesday about
[1:06:39] confidence that's what he preached and
[1:06:41] the people were lacking especially the
[1:06:42] ministers and the people themselves they
[1:06:44] were lacking confidence talking about
[1:06:46] this message many of them were saying
[1:06:47] you know people are calling them a c and
[1:06:49] so now how can you evangelize when
[1:06:50] people are calling you a c they even
[1:06:52] fear to express themselves to go out but
[1:06:54] you know after he preached those sermon
[1:06:56] especially that about confidence ah you
[1:06:58] know all the fear left all the fear left
[1:07:01] praise the name of the Lord give us the
[1:07:02] next one and uh this is now the the okay
[1:07:06] just the pulpit area that's brother
[1:07:08] Ephraim on the pulpit give us the next
[1:07:10] one okay now this picture is the picture
[1:07:13] for all the ministers all the ministers
[1:07:17] now uh uh that I don't know whether all
[1:07:20] but I think most of them that are
[1:07:22] working under the ministry of brother
[1:07:25] Ephraim or I should say working with
[1:07:26] brother Ephraim they but they all I
[1:07:28] should say they all these ministers who
[1:07:30] are here they came to the message
[1:07:32] through the ministry of our brother
[1:07:34] there in aasa you can imagine the kind
[1:07:36] of labors that have gone into that uh so
[1:07:40] the these are all from of course the
[1:07:42] southern parts of Ethiopia in aasa area
[1:07:44] or or surrounding the city of aasa in
[1:07:47] different I I had written a few names
[1:07:49] here but I think I don't have them ready
[1:07:52] but uh uh a few of the towns surrounding
[1:07:56] our uh I could tell a few names a few
[1:07:59] names I can't remember so I'll just
[1:08:02] leave leave the names for that but all
[1:08:04] these are ministers or rather should say
[1:08:05] preachers of this
[1:08:07] message let us have the next
[1:08:10] picture okay now this is a few other
[1:08:13] ministers with their wives I think two
[1:08:15] sisters there are married to some of
[1:08:17] those ministers um some of them I think
[1:08:20] like this brother here he works with
[1:08:22] brother Ephraim in the church there I
[1:08:24] think as a deacon and
[1:08:26] um uh I don't want to mess their names
[1:08:28] up and all that let's have the next
[1:08:31] picture okay that's now us the ones who
[1:08:34] had visited together with the pastor of
[1:08:37] the church we we thought we should take
[1:08:38] a picture together okay let us have
[1:08:40] another one um so now this you know when
[1:08:44] I saw the the the the the magnitude of
[1:08:47] how God had used um the magnitude of the
[1:08:50] work and how God had used brother
[1:08:52] Ephraim you know you cannot rush to
[1:08:54] ordain a man unless God has ordained him
[1:08:58] we do not call God calls we do not
[1:09:01] ordain God ordains we do not establish
[1:09:04] God establishes we do not equip God
[1:09:06] equips so when God we don't even bless
[1:09:09] God blesses okay so when God blesses
[1:09:12] somebody what do you do you bless what
[1:09:14] God has blessed and so um you know we we
[1:09:18] thought we should uh uh ordain him in
[1:09:22] the ministry there with to before his
[1:09:24] people as a pastor of the work and you
[1:09:27] know all the people there unanimously
[1:09:29] said he has been and he is a blessing to
[1:09:32] us his ministry has been a blessing to
[1:09:34] us they all agreed and we really had a
[1:09:36] uh a very good atmosphere as we were
[1:09:38] praying there with him I think brother
[1:09:41] Gary is over the other side but we we D
[1:09:43] him together okay um can I have the next
[1:09:48] picture that is uh Pastor ephra now uh
[1:09:52] with his wife and little baby over there
[1:09:55] sister Emmanuela and uh you know we we
[1:09:58] had a very good really good quality time
[1:10:01] we spent together in Fellowship um not
[1:10:04] only during the services but after the
[1:10:05] services especially I had some really
[1:10:08] really uh quality time with ephra and
[1:10:11] his his family we really had a good time
[1:10:14] we thank God for that you can see those
[1:10:15] sign post which he calls his church the
[1:10:18] message of Grace tanaco and uh it's it's
[1:10:22] really uh a beautiful uh thing to see
[1:10:25] the message going out into into you know
[1:10:27] the interior of Ethiopia with the
[1:10:30] Ethiopians having the Ethiopians having
[1:10:32] the vision this is not a vision of
[1:10:34] another man this is the vision of an
[1:10:36] Ethiopian in Ethiopia preaching to
[1:10:39] Ethiopians praise the name of the Lord
[1:10:42] amen let's see another picture okay okay
[1:10:45] I think we already saw that if you can
[1:10:47] get to another one all right so now this
[1:10:49] is the farewell we just had a little
[1:10:52] breakfast there with Brother Gary
[1:10:53] brother Tim and this Brothers really I
[1:10:55] appreciate them because they are I I
[1:10:58] told them I said Brothers you did not
[1:11:01] only preach when you were on the pull
[1:11:04] pit you preached through your life these
[1:11:06] brothers are true true Christians and we
[1:11:08] had a very wonderful experience with
[1:11:11] them serving to uh God together there in
[1:11:14] Ethiopia do we have another one I think
[1:11:17] we have a few more ah is that is that
[1:11:18] all okay thank you God bless you do you
[1:11:22] do you appreciate that little report
[1:11:25] amen and um I think I should say this um
[1:11:30] and I think I should we should we can
[1:11:32] first read the scripture and then I'll
[1:11:33] give I'm still I think this whole
[1:11:36] service is all about a report I'm still
[1:11:37] giving the report it's Ethiopian mission
[1:11:39] report it's still in my mind in my heart
[1:11:42] we can stand together read Hebrews
[1:11:44] chapter 11 and then we can continue from
[1:11:46] where we
[1:11:48] stopped Hebrews 11:
[1:11:53] 24 and since uh I'm not being
[1:11:55] interpreted I hope I will be very quick
[1:11:57] so I will not I'll not keep you waiting
[1:12:00] Hebrews 11:
[1:12:06] 24 let us pray father Lord as we now
[1:12:09] face uh your holy word and to just read
[1:12:12] out of portions out of the Bible I pray
[1:12:14] that you would give me inspiration Lord
[1:12:16] give me utterance may I speak only
[1:12:19] according to the Oracles of God this
[1:12:20] evening in Jesus name I pray amen
[1:12:25] by faith Moses when he was born was heed
[1:12:28] three months of his parents because they
[1:12:31] saw he was a proper child and they were
[1:12:33] not afraid of the king's commandment by
[1:12:36] faith Moses when he was come to years
[1:12:38] refused to be called the son of
[1:12:40] Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to
[1:12:42] suffer Affliction with the people of God
[1:12:45] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[1:12:48] season esteeming the reproach of Christ
[1:12:50] greater riches than the than the
[1:12:52] treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:12:56] respect unto the
[1:12:58] recompense of
[1:13:00] reward by faith he forsook Egypt not
[1:13:03] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:13:06] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:13:10] amen amen may the Lord add the blessing
[1:13:12] upon the reading of his word you may
[1:13:13] have your
[1:13:14] seats I think I should also say that uh
[1:13:17] uh we spent I I I I was able by God's
[1:13:20] grace also to meet a few Brothers in
[1:13:22] Adis Ababa who were able to make it to
[1:13:24] come and have some a little fellowship
[1:13:26] with us being that we only there for a
[1:13:28] few hours at the hotel and um every uh
[1:13:31] believer and Al all the brethren in aasa
[1:13:35] that we met sent you a warm greetings in
[1:13:38] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and um
[1:13:40] reading this scripture I'm thinking
[1:13:42] about um brother Ephraim and his
[1:13:45] ministry there in aasa and what I have
[1:13:47] seen you know God do in the last three
[1:13:49] years in his life and Ministry to me
[1:13:52] when I saw what I saw I saw a miracle I
[1:13:55] saw a miracle I saw a miracle I saw what
[1:13:58] God can do uh with a man who has
[1:14:01] followed the leadership of the spirit
[1:14:03] and this evening I'm speaking on if you
[1:14:05] want to call my title the leadership of
[1:14:07] the spirit and you know uh some years
[1:14:10] ago I do not remember how many my wife I
[1:14:13] think she stepped out she could have
[1:14:15] reminded me uh when we first met brother
[1:14:17] Ephraim we went to their house his
[1:14:19] mother was there and sister and uh when
[1:14:21] he came out he was the first one to come
[1:14:23] and receive us and and uh I saw him
[1:14:26] coming in a distance and as I saw him
[1:14:29] the moment my eyes looked at him like
[1:14:31] this you know the Holy Spirit ministered
[1:14:33] to me that he would believe the message
[1:14:36] and he would be a preacher of it I mean
[1:14:38] this is a younger boy so you could not
[1:14:41] tell what the future would be it's only
[1:14:42] God who knows our future by the way it's
[1:14:45] not only God it's only God who can tell
[1:14:47] what your future would be it has nothing
[1:14:49] to do with a man unless the man unless
[1:14:51] God can reveal to a man so when I saw
[1:14:53] him like this I turned to my wife wife
[1:14:55] and I told her that this young man is
[1:14:58] going to believe the message and he will
[1:15:00] preach this message around this country
[1:15:02] and my wife you know believes in my
[1:15:04] Ministry so she thought that that was a
[1:15:06] prophetic utterance she said amen and
[1:15:09] the young man received us and the rest
[1:15:11] is history and so it reminds me you know
[1:15:14] he was the youngest of all the brothers
[1:15:15] when we we first reached out in a when
[1:15:18] we had the church there by the time we
[1:15:20] left he was the youngest of the brothers
[1:15:22] and he was still you know he was a
[1:15:24] basket B and you know getting into those
[1:15:26] things and then he left it when he came
[1:15:28] to the message and he desired to go and
[1:15:30] I'm sharing this testimony not only for
[1:15:32] for a testimony but also for an
[1:15:33] encouragement to especially the younger
[1:15:35] brothers who are here and who are doing
[1:15:37] nothing for the Lord you know he was a
[1:15:40] basketballer and with a lot of vibrancy
[1:15:42] and a lot of life and he was a very
[1:15:45] good he was very good in in basketball
[1:15:48] really but um you know when this message
[1:15:50] got a hold of him he left it all he he
[1:15:53] dropped it not to say that baset
[1:15:55] basketball is sin or sinful but you know
[1:15:58] when you get the revelation of the word
[1:16:00] everything else seems as nothing you
[1:16:03] want to surrender your life completely
[1:16:04] especially if you have a calling of God
[1:16:06] upon your life you want to surrender
[1:16:07] your life completely to that and forsake
[1:16:10] everything else just like I forsook
[1:16:11] everything else and decided I said I'm
[1:16:13] going to give my life to the Lord that
[1:16:16] he will use me as he desires as he wills
[1:16:19] and um later on of course he would get
[1:16:21] to be baptized and his family followed
[1:16:23] him um the were all baptized and now
[1:16:26] when we left Ethiopia because and the
[1:16:28] reason why we left Ethiopia is because
[1:16:30] uh they brought up a law a new rule when
[1:16:32] they say that now uh no one can no
[1:16:35] preacher foreign preacher can live in
[1:16:37] Ethiopia because to live in Ethiopia you
[1:16:39] have to to have a residence perit and
[1:16:41] all that and you have to you know renew
[1:16:43] it every year so they say to to be able
[1:16:45] to live in Ethiopia you need to have a a
[1:16:48] theology uh certificate or or seminary
[1:16:51] training for at least a year and then I
[1:16:54] I told my wife if I said um you know
[1:16:57] when God sent us to Ethiopia we do not
[1:16:58] have he did not send us in to Ethiopia
[1:17:01] on the basis of a theological uh uh
[1:17:04] College license Seminary how come that
[1:17:07] we want to stay here on this basis I
[1:17:10] told my wife it seems the door for us to
[1:17:13] stay here has come to an end it's
[1:17:16] closing may not necessarily mean our
[1:17:18] ministry in Ethiopia was closing but I
[1:17:19] felt strongly in my heart our time for
[1:17:23] staying cuz we when we went to Ethiopia
[1:17:25] we thought we would stay permanently at
[1:17:27] one point I even went to the immigration
[1:17:29] and I told them I am ready because they
[1:17:31] don't accept dual citizenship um I think
[1:17:34] uh if I'm not mistaken so they told us
[1:17:37] um I I told them rather that if you
[1:17:40] would like for me to change my
[1:17:41] citizenship I am ready to do that I was
[1:17:44] ready to even surrender my Ugandan
[1:17:46] citizenship so that I can become a
[1:17:48] citizen in Ethiopia and stay there not
[1:17:50] that Ethiopia was easy it was we to us
[1:17:53] and my wife it was one one of the
[1:17:55] hardest countries for us to ever live in
[1:17:57] not because the people were bad but
[1:17:59] because the the the culture the food the
[1:18:02] the like basically everything is almost
[1:18:05] the opposite of what we have here
[1:18:06] because here we have been westernized by
[1:18:08] colonization and everything so there
[1:18:10] it's a little bit different with with
[1:18:12] here so we thought we would stay there
[1:18:14] for forever and and at one point but
[1:18:17] then when this came after we had stayed
[1:18:19] there for about 6 seven years you know I
[1:18:22] um told my wife I think our time for
[1:18:24] staying here has come to an end and um
[1:18:27] and um you know we we we I I I spoke to
[1:18:30] a few Brothers they said no well some
[1:18:31] some some of them were saying well you
[1:18:33] can get you can even buy this paper from
[1:18:35] one of the Seminary Seminary or colleges
[1:18:38] and then you just tell them you are a
[1:18:40] theologian and you know they all they
[1:18:41] need is a paper but I thought that is
[1:18:43] forgery if I Forge that in order to
[1:18:46] preach I wouldn't even have the
[1:18:49] conscience to preach out of my heart I
[1:18:51] said I not do this in my clear mind I
[1:18:54] will not do this I am going to go back
[1:18:56] to
[1:18:57] Uganda I said I'm going to go back to
[1:18:59] Uganda and so I came back to Uganda and
[1:19:02] at that time um you know brother Ephraim
[1:19:05] was still in In Living with his parents
[1:19:08] in in in
[1:19:10] Addis um but then time came when he uh
[1:19:14] felt led and this is sovereignly I never
[1:19:16] had anything to do with it no one else
[1:19:18] had to do even his family never had
[1:19:20] anything to do with it he said I I feel
[1:19:22] led of the Lord to go and do a work a
[1:19:24] walk in aasa to just go in aasa and and
[1:19:26] and preach of course we were starting a
[1:19:28] little Fellowship there so maybe he
[1:19:29] thought he would um go and help them I
[1:19:32] don't know what he thought felt led of
[1:19:35] the Lord he told me I feel led to go to
[1:19:37] aasa so no one agreed with him because
[1:19:40] among many reasons one of the reasons
[1:19:42] was his age he was young okay so no one
[1:19:46] really agreed with him so he obeyed but
[1:19:49] he obeyed the leadership of God he
[1:19:51] obeyed the leadership of the spirit and
[1:19:53] he went to aasa and you know when he
[1:19:55] reached in aasa he was all by himself
[1:19:58] and you know having nobody having
[1:20:00] nothing and you know he meets this woman
[1:20:03] and of course he told this testimony
[1:20:04] here at the bench he meets this woman
[1:20:06] and this woman would come to him and
[1:20:08] tell him prophesy give him a false
[1:20:10] prophecy he said you going to die in a
[1:20:12] few days gave him even the number of
[1:20:14] days said you're going to die in so many
[1:20:16] days if you stay in aasa but uh he
[1:20:19] obeyed still the leadership of the
[1:20:21] spirit Brethren if the Holy Spirit
[1:20:23] ministers to you obey the leadership of
[1:20:26] the Holy Spirit even if you have to
[1:20:28] disagree with mother with father with
[1:20:30] with the uncle with with the pastor even
[1:20:33] with the with friend with the family it
[1:20:35] doesn't matter as long as you are
[1:20:37] obeying the leadership of the Holy
[1:20:39] Spirit there is something about the
[1:20:41] leadership of the spirit that I want to
[1:20:42] share with you
[1:20:44] tonight never he never had money he
[1:20:46] never had any resources he just simply
[1:20:49] went by faith he packed a few clothes he
[1:20:52] had and he went to AA now you have seen
[1:20:55] the fruit that came out what is that
[1:20:58] that is the fruit of a man obeying the
[1:21:00] leadership of the spirit praise the name
[1:21:04] of the Lord it reminds me when we first
[1:21:06] went to Ethiopia no one agreed with us
[1:21:08] no one you know uh even there was a man
[1:21:11] you know I I wouldn't want to say his
[1:21:13] name but you know he uh he told he told
[1:21:16] me you cannot come here you are very
[1:21:18] young you are not experienced you have
[1:21:20] been only preaching for a few years you
[1:21:21] cannot I cannot allow you here so I fa
[1:21:24] so broken but friends I still obey the
[1:21:27] the Holy Spirit leadership and when we
[1:21:28] went there you can now see what the Lord
[1:21:30] has done it's not about a man it's about
[1:21:33] the spirit when the Holy Spirit leads a
[1:21:36] man it is because he wants to use that
[1:21:38] man for him not for the man but for the
[1:21:40] for him to do something through that man
[1:21:43] and and so I asked today I asked brother
[1:21:46] Ephraim do you have can you give me some
[1:21:48] testimony of course he had been giving
[1:21:50] them for to me for a while so I needed
[1:21:52] to hear some of these testimonies of
[1:21:54] what the Lord had been doing over the
[1:21:56] years um or since he went there for for
[1:21:59] for about these three years and I have
[1:22:01] about four outstanding testimonies here
[1:22:03] that I would like to share with you and
[1:22:05] this really really moved my heart and
[1:22:07] one of them says he told me brother
[1:22:09] taera his name is was um his age was 120
[1:22:13] 120 a man of 120 years so his son his
[1:22:18] son his age is 70 years so this man came
[1:22:22] and was baptized this man of 70 years
[1:22:24] was bapti baptized and after he got
[1:22:26] baptized you know he reached out to his
[1:22:28] father of 120 years and this man of 120
[1:22:32] years believed the message and and he
[1:22:35] after he had believed the message six
[1:22:37] months later he slept he slept believing
[1:22:40] well I don't know about you but I've
[1:22:41] never baptized a man of 120 years to me
[1:22:44] I thought that is a miracle because
[1:22:46] usually they believe when they are young
[1:22:48] not when they are old praise the name of
[1:22:50] the Lord and then he says here a man who
[1:22:52] works in the government office and
[1:22:54] alcoholic for 16 years un alcoholic for
[1:22:56] 16 years causing financial and emotional
[1:22:59] stress to his family brother ephra says
[1:23:02] I never prayed for him no one prayed for
[1:23:04] him but one day after a beautiful sermon
[1:23:07] he called it a beautiful sermon he said
[1:23:09] one day after a beautiful sermon on
[1:23:11] Sunday afternoon he came and told me he
[1:23:14] has a testimony he got out to the pull
[1:23:16] pit and exposed he exposed his problem
[1:23:18] of addiction and he said after coming to
[1:23:21] this church for one year regularly now I
[1:23:24] have not been taking alcohol for 2
[1:23:26] months
[1:23:27] straight
[1:23:29] hallelujah amen yes that's a miracle and
[1:23:32] he gave me another testimony here and
[1:23:34] this is a powerful one it says there was
[1:23:35] a mother who had two boys and both of
[1:23:38] them were born ill I don't know I do not
[1:23:40] know what kind of illness but probably
[1:23:41] some of those who are born without maybe
[1:23:44] cerebral palcy I'm not too sure what the
[1:23:46] sickness was he says they can't they
[1:23:48] couldn't think straight I believe it is
[1:23:50] so he says we prayed for both of the
[1:23:52] boys for 9 months so they prayed for
[1:23:55] both of the boys for nine months uh that
[1:23:58] is an exercise of faith and and one and
[1:24:01] one boy was 18 years old so he got
[1:24:04] healed and now he's in
[1:24:07] school Hallelujah and he said they still
[1:24:10] praying for the other boy amen and and
[1:24:13] this other testimony says this is an
[1:24:15] outstanding testimony it says there's a
[1:24:17] doctor in aasa University his name is Dr
[1:24:21] ABA he says d director of a university
[1:24:25] so he has been against the student
[1:24:27] Fellowship in the university for many
[1:24:29] months but as the fellowship was going
[1:24:31] on one of the young brothers gave him
[1:24:33] the church age book after reading that
[1:24:36] he contacted him me he says and wanted
[1:24:39] to know more after receiving the message
[1:24:41] he told me he wanted to be baptized as
[1:24:43] he got baptized as he got baptized he
[1:24:46] says this man had a sight problem his
[1:24:48] eyes could not see well but as this man
[1:24:51] got baptized God gave him a Clear Sight
[1:24:56] after that amen and since that time he
[1:24:59] has since supported the student
[1:25:01] Fellowship in the university and you
[1:25:03] know the some of the student Believers
[1:25:06] were actually even at at the convention
[1:25:08] you know and he contributed in that in
[1:25:10] that convention this man this doctor he
[1:25:12] contributed the whole sound system and
[1:25:14] all the chairs of the
[1:25:17] convention
[1:25:18] Hallelujah now you're talking about the
[1:25:20] God of this message praise the name of
[1:25:23] the Lord when God calls you he equips
[1:25:26] you praise the name of the Lord and I
[1:25:28] want to read just tonight I just want to
[1:25:30] preach by reading a few quotes out of
[1:25:31] the message and I trust that it will be
[1:25:33] a blessing to you in the Ephesian Church
[1:25:35] age brother bam says something and
[1:25:36] tonight remember I'm speaking on the
[1:25:38] leadership of the spirit the leadership
[1:25:41] of the spirit tell your neighbor the
[1:25:42] leadership of the
[1:25:44] spirit and I had a reason why I shared
[1:25:46] those testimonies because we we are
[1:25:48] taking an example of someone that God
[1:25:50] has led by the by the spirit to go into
[1:25:52] some place and then see what God has
[1:25:54] done and now he says now now what was
[1:25:57] the spiritual climate brother bham asks
[1:25:59] the question this is I'm now quoting
[1:26:01] what was the spiritual climate of that
[1:26:02] church it had left its first love living
[1:26:06] its first love of the word of God was
[1:26:08] revealed to us as having fallen from its
[1:26:10] origin which was Pentecost meaning the
[1:26:13] origin of every church or the origin of
[1:26:15] the church is Pentecost but this church
[1:26:18] had fallen from its origin in plain
[1:26:21] English that means this church was in
[1:26:23] danger of being away from the leading of
[1:26:25] the Holy Spirit when the church is no
[1:26:28] longer under the leading of the holy
[1:26:30] spirit that church has already been uh
[1:26:32] or rather I should say is already in
[1:26:34] danger of being taken away from the
[1:26:35] original when the church is not
[1:26:37] following the leading of the Holy Ghost
[1:26:39] it is no longer under the control of the
[1:26:41] Holy Ghost but then he says this was
[1:26:43] exactly what took place after Moses LED
[1:26:45] Israel out of Egypt the way of God was
[1:26:48] to lead them by The Cloud of fire listen
[1:26:51] carefully the way of God now there is
[1:26:53] remember there is a way of God and a way
[1:26:56] of man the the things I'm going to share
[1:26:59] today are very very important especially
[1:27:02] for people who want to serve God you
[1:27:04] need to know how do I have to go what do
[1:27:07] I have to do it doesn't matter who you
[1:27:08] are you a woman man you know young and
[1:27:10] old listen he says the way of God was to
[1:27:12] lead them by The Cloud of fire this if
[1:27:15] it was it is and it will always be this
[1:27:18] is always the way of God the way of God
[1:27:20] was to lead them by The Cloud of fire
[1:27:22] uhhuh that's number one number two by
[1:27:24] prophetic utterance I wish I would get a
[1:27:26] quote here so that everybody of us can
[1:27:27] read it together brother this is in the
[1:27:29] church age book in particular the
[1:27:31] Ephesian Church age so he says the way
[1:27:33] of God was to lead them by The Cloud of
[1:27:36] Fire by prophetic utterance how many
[1:27:38] believe in the cloud of fire how many
[1:27:40] believe in prophetic utterances how many
[1:27:43] believe in miracles and signs amen he
[1:27:46] says the way of God and that I want to
[1:27:49] say has always been the way of God it
[1:27:51] will always be the way of God it will
[1:27:53] never change
[1:27:55] God's way is always to lead his church
[1:27:57] with a pillar of fire with a cloud of
[1:27:59] fire with prophetic utterance with
[1:28:01] Miracles and signs he says and God given
[1:28:04] Wonders that is the way of God to lead
[1:28:06] his
[1:28:07] church god- given wonders this was to be
[1:28:10] accomplished amen that's how God leads
[1:28:12] his church but how does he accomplish it
[1:28:15] he accomplishes it by what by God
[1:28:18] selected and God ordained and God
[1:28:21] equipped and God sent men
[1:28:25] amen not men listen he did not say men
[1:28:29] ordained God men selected go men
[1:28:33] equipped and Men sent no you know
[1:28:35] brother B in one of the quotes and many
[1:28:37] quotes he says if if man sent you let
[1:28:39] man do what support you are you message
[1:28:42] readers if man sent you let man do what
[1:28:46] if your church sent you let your church
[1:28:48] do what but if God sent you let God do
[1:28:52] what amen it means a church can send
[1:28:55] someone out right and it is okay it is
[1:28:57] okay we can say we want to send brother
[1:28:59] amam to go and and uh you know in
[1:29:05] where in paa we can say brother am we
[1:29:08] going to send you to paa if we send you
[1:29:10] to paa if we as a church send you to paa
[1:29:12] we have to support you we have to pay
[1:29:14] your way we have to uh you know pay all
[1:29:16] the needs that you you have there
[1:29:18] because the church has sent you all
[1:29:20] right and that's okay it's okay the
[1:29:22] church has sent you the church should
[1:29:24] take care of you but if God sends you
[1:29:27] then God should take care of
[1:29:29] you amen we have so many Church sent men
[1:29:33] but I am looking for God sent men I
[1:29:36] believe the church needs God sent men
[1:29:40] amen because these men are going to be
[1:29:42] God selected them amen God given them
[1:29:45] God ordained God equipped God sent
[1:29:49] man he says you know with the whole Camp
[1:29:52] amen the whole Camp the whole church
[1:29:53] being dominated by the Holy Ghost
[1:29:58] move the church should be dominated by
[1:30:00] the Holy Ghost move not by
[1:30:03] man move but by the Holy Ghost move I am
[1:30:09] showing you here today the difference
[1:30:11] between the
[1:30:13] denominations and The Message Church the
[1:30:16] message church or a message church is
[1:30:19] different from
[1:30:21] denominations The Message Church is the
[1:30:24] church that is Le or LED rather by God
[1:30:28] selected God ordained God equipped and
[1:30:31] God sent
[1:30:32] men and is dominated by a holy ghost
[1:30:38] move they rebelled what did they do they
[1:30:41] rebelled and wanted a set of rules these
[1:30:43] people the Jew the Israelites for them
[1:30:45] they wanted a set of rules they wanted
[1:30:48] the Creed to go by so they wanted a
[1:30:51] king then they wanted to be exactly like
[1:30:54] the world and they went into apostasy
[1:30:57] and Oblivion the prophet says that is
[1:30:59] exactly how the first church age started
[1:31:01] and it it will get listen this is a
[1:31:03] prophecy brother says it will get worse
[1:31:06] and worse until the holy spirit is
[1:31:10] completely rejected and God Must Destroy
[1:31:13] the
[1:31:15] people this is what he said this is what
[1:31:18] is say it will get worse and worse until
[1:31:21] the Holy Ghost is what completely
[1:31:23] rejected
[1:31:26] how many will believe if a man stands up
[1:31:28] and says God is leading me to go and do
[1:31:30] something how many will believe even
[1:31:33] Among Us the message Believers many
[1:31:36] times we simply want to play
[1:31:39] politics we simply want to pull people
[1:31:41] to our churches we simply want people to
[1:31:44] follow us or or be under us or control
[1:31:47] them but let me tell you brother sister
[1:31:49] amen that will destroy the people and
[1:31:51] that has always destroyed the people but
[1:31:53] brother bam here gives a prophecy and he
[1:31:55] says it will get worse and worse until
[1:32:00] the Holy Ghost completely is what
[1:32:04] rejected the church in the out there in
[1:32:07] the denominational world what did they
[1:32:09] do they rejected the Holy Ghost because
[1:32:12] they said God revealed to us and we
[1:32:14] believe a b CDE e f g z and that's all
[1:32:18] we believe and they have church manuals
[1:32:20] that's why in the message we have no
[1:32:21] church manual we are not let by Church
[1:32:24] manual we are not led by Constitution we
[1:32:27] are not led by by laws we are led by the
[1:32:29] Holy Ghost and the
[1:32:31] word we are not LED and ruled over by
[1:32:34] just men we are ruled over by the Holy
[1:32:36] Ghost I don't care what a man says if a
[1:32:39] man does not say what the Bible says
[1:32:41] then I don't want to hear it because if
[1:32:44] a man is led by the holy ghost He will
[1:32:46] always say what the word
[1:32:49] says see he says see how it started out
[1:32:52] in the early church it was called Deeds
[1:32:56] then it became a Doctrine it became the
[1:32:58] standard it became the unbelieving word
[1:33:01] the unbending way rather it finally took
[1:33:04] over and God was pushed
[1:33:08] aside oh it started so small so quietly
[1:33:13] so inoffensively it looked so good it
[1:33:16] seemed so sound then it caught a hold
[1:33:19] and like a
[1:33:21] Pyon like a Pyon it squeezed out every
[1:33:25] breath and killed all the spirituality
[1:33:27] there was in the
[1:33:29] church any the church that rejects the
[1:33:33] moving and the leadership of the Holy
[1:33:35] Spirit has rejected
[1:33:40] God praise God oh he says that false
[1:33:44] Vine is subtle it is like an angel of
[1:33:47] Light until it gets a hold on you now I
[1:33:51] want to say that I believe in leadership
[1:33:54] but it is not oh my God I wish Believers
[1:33:57] would say Amen to this brother bam says
[1:33:59] I believe in leadership everybody say I
[1:34:01] believe in
[1:34:02] leadership but he says it is not the
[1:34:05] leadership of men I believe in am I
[1:34:09] preaching to believer tonight I don't
[1:34:11] believe in the leadership of men ah I
[1:34:14] just told you I preached a man sent from
[1:34:16] God so are you now saying changing your
[1:34:17] mind that you no longer believe in the
[1:34:19] leadership of men yes I'm not changing
[1:34:21] my mind that's what I've always believed
[1:34:26] and that's what the prophet has always
[1:34:28] taught so does God use men oh yes he
[1:34:31] does so listen that's not all don't
[1:34:33] don't just walk away from from me right
[1:34:35] now listen to the to the rest of it it
[1:34:38] is not a leadership of men I believe in
[1:34:40] I believe in the leadership of the Holy
[1:34:43] Ghost coming through the
[1:34:45] word amen oh you ought to shout Amen to
[1:34:50] that I believe also that God God has set
[1:34:54] men in the church men who are gifted by
[1:34:58] the
[1:34:59] spirit and they will keep the church in
[1:35:01] order I believe that I believe also that
[1:35:05] the church is ruled over by men that God
[1:35:09] sends to take
[1:35:11] charge God still sends men God still
[1:35:15] anoints men God still sends out his
[1:35:17] servants that will take charge of the
[1:35:20] church no man has a right to preach the
[1:35:23] gospel unless God has sent him out no
[1:35:26] man has a right to say he's preaching or
[1:35:28] to say he's setting a church or to say
[1:35:30] he's going somewhere unless he has had
[1:35:33] that say the
[1:35:34] Lord unless he has had an experience
[1:35:37] with God because God still sends
[1:35:40] men you see he says I believe that I
[1:35:43] believe also that the church is ruled
[1:35:45] over by men that God sends to take
[1:35:47] church but that rule everybody say that
[1:35:51] rule that rule is by what
[1:35:54] by the word not saying not I am your
[1:35:57] pastor do this no no no no no no no we
[1:35:59] are let me tell you we are above that we
[1:36:02] are we are way above that we don't
[1:36:05] follow men blindly no more amen we have
[1:36:08] been say oh my God we are being
[1:36:10] liberated by this message we are been
[1:36:12] set free by this message we are no
[1:36:14] longer following men blindly We are
[1:36:17] following men who are ruling Us by the
[1:36:19] word and by the Holy Ghost not by their
[1:36:22] ego not by their feelings not by their
[1:36:25] educational theology we are being led by
[1:36:27] the Holy
[1:36:28] Ghost Hallelujah that's what this entire
[1:36:32] message is that rule is by the word so
[1:36:37] that it is not men really ruling but the
[1:36:41] spirit of God for the word and the
[1:36:44] spirit are
[1:36:46] one
[1:36:48] amen some of you came from those
[1:36:50] denominations where they threatened to
[1:36:52] take your name out of the book H where
[1:36:55] they threaten that you will go to hell
[1:36:56] if you leave where they said if you
[1:36:58] leave this church your blessings are
[1:37:00] remaining here but I am so glad no man
[1:37:03] has a key to my blessing I am so glad I
[1:37:06] have believed a message that is a super
[1:37:10] message amen how can they say that your
[1:37:13] blessing is with us no man has your
[1:37:15] blessing your blessing is with God
[1:37:17] actually your blessing is with the word
[1:37:19] if you leave the word you have left the
[1:37:21] blessing of God but if you stay with the
[1:37:23] word but the blessing of God can never
[1:37:25] leave
[1:37:27] you amen and so in Hebrews 13:7 it says
[1:37:31] remember them which have the rule over
[1:37:33] you they have the rule over you he's
[1:37:35] talking about the ministers the pastors
[1:37:36] the preachers right who have spoken unto
[1:37:38] you the word of God who Faith follow who
[1:37:41] Faith follow considering the end of
[1:37:43] their conversation so you see consider
[1:37:45] them respect them he means you know they
[1:37:48] have the rule over you honor them I
[1:37:50] believe in honoring men of God I believe
[1:37:51] in honoring pastors if a man come out
[1:37:53] even if he's not your pastor even if
[1:37:55] he's just a pastor in the body of Christ
[1:37:56] but not directly your pastor you have to
[1:37:58] honor him you have to respect him you
[1:38:01] don't have to you know people go back
[1:38:02] biting their Pastor they're get getting
[1:38:04] curses not because the man is big but
[1:38:07] because the man is is a servant of God
[1:38:10] even when your pastor does a mistake
[1:38:12] brother let God be the one to you know
[1:38:14] work on him you know God always wants to
[1:38:16] be the one to you know discipline his
[1:38:19] own servants you know this man this man
[1:38:21] of God comes up and his name was U you
[1:38:23] know Elisha and Elisha you know was
[1:38:25] having a bald head and these children
[1:38:26] are laughing at him oh bald head bald
[1:38:28] head he called the Sheep bearers to come
[1:38:30] out of the forest they ate all of them I
[1:38:32] think they were more than 80 right all
[1:38:34] of them they died what the man was angry
[1:38:38] yes it was the anger of a man of God but
[1:38:40] remember not a man a man of God so God
[1:38:43] honors the words of a man of God that's
[1:38:46] why we honor the men of God because we
[1:38:48] are fearing God Amen when when Moses
[1:38:50] broke the word did he not break the word
[1:38:52] he indeed broke the word word he went
[1:38:54] and married out of the word imagine he
[1:38:57] married you know a it's just like a
[1:38:59] pastor marrying out of another race you
[1:39:01] know our Prophet advises us to marry
[1:39:04] within our race do we believe that I
[1:39:07] take the prophet's advis as that say the
[1:39:09] Lord this is my opinion it's up to you
[1:39:11] to take it as what you want but me I
[1:39:14] took it as serious you know some many
[1:39:17] many young people they always like uh
[1:39:19] taking it as a as a joke say well we
[1:39:22] have only one rest as the rest of
[1:39:24] Believers yeah that's all right that's
[1:39:25] true it's doctrinally correct but
[1:39:27] brother bham gave an opinion and his
[1:39:29] opinion to me I would rather take his
[1:39:30] opinion than take my opinion I'd rather
[1:39:33] take his opinion than take your opinion
[1:39:35] so to you who wants to marry white you
[1:39:38] know a prophet gave us uh the advice
[1:39:41] what did he say he said God has a flower
[1:39:43] garden and it has red black yellow blue
[1:39:46] but they are all beautiful in his sight
[1:39:48] and and he said what would make a a
[1:39:50] black girl want to marry a white man for
[1:39:52] ance vers you would get a mixed a mixed
[1:39:55] rest which cannot reproduce itself so he
[1:39:57] says stay within your what stay within
[1:39:59] your race and it's an advice of a
[1:40:01] prophet and I take it and you find that
[1:40:03] if you mix the reses you find that this
[1:40:05] has a different culture this has a
[1:40:06] different culture and you know it is
[1:40:07] very difficult to reconcile so stay with
[1:40:09] us say the Lord when God sends a man
[1:40:11] honor him and listen to what he has to
[1:40:13] say are you hearing what I'm saying and
[1:40:16] so friends we believe in honoring
[1:40:18] Servants of God but make no mistake we
[1:40:19] don't believe in man manhandling the
[1:40:22] body of Christ
[1:40:24] man if man is is is is sent by God He
[1:40:28] will always respect by the way the only
[1:40:30] way one of the ways you can actually
[1:40:31] know that a man is sent by God he's a
[1:40:34] preacher he's a minister he's called by
[1:40:36] God He will always honor the body of
[1:40:38] Christ he will always honor the children
[1:40:39] of God he will never manhandle them he
[1:40:42] will never manhandle them and you know
[1:40:45] when we understand that then we can know
[1:40:47] look yes we are under this ministry but
[1:40:49] we are not having a rope in our
[1:40:53] neck all of us including our pastor is
[1:40:56] led by what by the spirit the spirit
[1:41:00] still leads God still leads God still
[1:41:03] speaks God is true can you say Amen to
[1:41:07] that now I told you I'm going to read a
[1:41:10] a few quotes and many out of the church
[1:41:12] age book but also other messages now
[1:41:13] listen to this one is out of the message
[1:41:14] leadership he says and Moses was a rich
[1:41:18] young ruler to become a
[1:41:20] pharaoh he was Pharaoh's son and was
[1:41:23] hair to the throne and he looked out to
[1:41:26] the impossible a bunch of m ders a bunch
[1:41:30] of slaves but by faith he saw the
[1:41:33] promise of God through the
[1:41:36] word that his people would s in a
[1:41:39] Strange Land for 400 years but would be
[1:41:43] brought out by a mighty
[1:41:46] hand he esteemed that he esteemed that
[1:41:49] Hallelujah he esteemed greater riches
[1:41:52] that greater riches than all the
[1:41:54] treasures of Egypt for he forsook Egypt
[1:41:56] not knowing where he was going he was
[1:41:59] led by Christ he forsook Egypt he was
[1:42:02] led by
[1:42:03] Christ I remember I was going to be a
[1:42:06] priest in the Anglican church right now
[1:42:07] I would have been having robes but when
[1:42:09] this revelation of this message came to
[1:42:12] me I forsook everything else I became
[1:42:15] crazy I said I want to be live this
[1:42:17] message I even want to become a preacher
[1:42:19] of this message I don't care where I am
[1:42:21] going friends if you forsake everything
[1:42:24] else for the cause of Christ you can
[1:42:26] never
[1:42:29] regret he was led by Christ amen it's
[1:42:34] very interesting and very wonderful for
[1:42:35] you to know that you are led by Christ
[1:42:38] and he said and he had his foot on the
[1:42:40] throne he could have been the next
[1:42:42] Pharaoh in Egypt you know oh my um I was
[1:42:48] just inspired by by this thought seeing
[1:42:51] what God did through the life of brother
[1:42:52] Ephraim and knowing very well that he he
[1:42:55] could have accomplished a lot of things
[1:42:57] if he had gone the other way
[1:42:59] around you know he got married here in
[1:43:02] Uganda probably his mother-in-law and
[1:43:03] the family and the the the wife and all
[1:43:06] others could probably be following or
[1:43:07] hear this later you know he he got
[1:43:10] married in Uganda and uh you know from
[1:43:13] from a family that is is um you know
[1:43:16] could be able to sustain him here and
[1:43:18] maybe get him to start life on and I
[1:43:20] tried to convince him and I know I said
[1:43:22] this public and that's okay I tried to
[1:43:24] convince him to come to Uganda cuz I
[1:43:25] knew I would be happy if he's close to
[1:43:27] me I said come on come here in Uganda
[1:43:29] and and you know and you know you can
[1:43:31] even go preach among the Ethiopian
[1:43:32] people and here who are in Uganda and
[1:43:35] stay here and live here and have a nice
[1:43:37] living and have a comfortable life you
[1:43:39] know he looked at me and I knew in
[1:43:41] Ethiopia it was going to be a little
[1:43:43] tough if he would decide to leave there
[1:43:45] with his family but you know he looked
[1:43:47] at me and he said I have a
[1:43:50] calling in my country among my
[1:43:53] people I looked at him I couldn't
[1:43:56] believe my eyes I couldn't believe my
[1:43:58] ears but you know as a a man I couldn't
[1:44:01] understand it but when I heard I have a
[1:44:04] leadership of the spirit to go and be
[1:44:07] among my people and Minister among them
[1:44:09] I said that's enough you don't need to
[1:44:10] tell me more if that's what you are
[1:44:12] giving me as a reason to live there then
[1:44:15] you have my support and I want to tell
[1:44:17] you Church always honor always respect
[1:44:20] always stand behind anybody that says
[1:44:23] God is leading them to do something you
[1:44:25] would rather support that and be wrong
[1:44:28] than to be found fighting against
[1:44:31] God you know Moses he had his foot on
[1:44:36] the throne he could have been the next
[1:44:37] Pharaoh in Egypt but he esteemed the
[1:44:40] reproach of Christ the reproach to be
[1:44:43] called the old one Amen to be called a
[1:44:46] fanatic to take the place with the
[1:44:48] maders and the Fanatics because he seen
[1:44:51] that how the scripture was promis to be
[1:44:53] fulfilled he saw what God was going to
[1:44:56] do you know when God calls you into
[1:44:58] doing something you see what others
[1:45:00] can't see it is made made real to you it
[1:45:03] is open to you you can understand it
[1:45:05] it's like you know it's an understanding
[1:45:06] you know the Bible says to know the
[1:45:08] kingdom of God to know is to understand
[1:45:10] to to
[1:45:11] see and the church he says wake up
[1:45:15] Church wake up can you see the same
[1:45:17] thing tonight the how that has been
[1:45:19] promised is on us esteem the reproach of
[1:45:22] Jesus Christ esteem it Greater riches
[1:45:25] esteem it he's talking to you now you
[1:45:27] have to esteem the reproach of Jesus
[1:45:30] Christ greater riches than all the
[1:45:32] fellowship of
[1:45:37] anything I had a man from the north of
[1:45:40] Ethiopia his name is brother okba I'm
[1:45:42] sure he might also be following I'm not
[1:45:45] I I think so and so this brother you
[1:45:48] know he was a deacon in in in in m in a
[1:45:52] full church one of the elders there but
[1:45:55] he had this message he got baptized God
[1:45:58] filled him with the Holy Ghost and he
[1:45:59] looked at me and said I cannot stay in
[1:46:01] this church I said brother if it's your
[1:46:03] decision and God is leading you to do it
[1:46:04] then do
[1:46:05] it he left he left the denomination and
[1:46:09] he has been fellowshipping you know with
[1:46:11] his family the rest of the family also
[1:46:13] believe the message and I believe God is
[1:46:14] going to call many more in that part of
[1:46:16] the of the country and he says esteem
[1:46:18] the reproach of Jesus Christ greater
[1:46:20] riches than all the fellowship of
[1:46:21] anything than all the fellowship of the
[1:46:23] denominations we left the beautiful
[1:46:24] churches we left the beautiful carpets
[1:46:27] we left the big buildings we left why we
[1:46:30] left the associations we left the the
[1:46:32] money we left everything why amen
[1:46:34] because we can esteem the reproach of
[1:46:37] Jesus greater than any other
[1:46:40] thing if it takes further now this is
[1:46:44] not my words this is Brother Bam's our
[1:46:46] prophet's words listen it says if it TT
[1:46:48] father if it TT mother if it TT Church
[1:46:51] anything else follow the leadership of
[1:46:55] the
[1:46:57] spirit may God help us Amen to follow
[1:47:01] always the leadership of the spirit you
[1:47:04] know you come to a place where it is
[1:47:05] tough and you say Lord what would you
[1:47:07] have me to do and you are sure you are
[1:47:10] being led by the spirit everything you
[1:47:12] do by the way you have to be led by the
[1:47:13] spirit if you're not led by the spirit
[1:47:15] you are led by something else and that's
[1:47:17] not God of course amen and you know
[1:47:21] someone may say God has told me to for
[1:47:23] you to do this don't just go and do it
[1:47:24] because God told them God has to tell
[1:47:26] you you have to be led by the spirit too
[1:47:29] you know and brother bam told us how to
[1:47:31] know the will of God how to be led by
[1:47:32] the spirit he said you pray over the
[1:47:34] matter you pray over the matter you say
[1:47:35] God what would you have me to do and
[1:47:37] sometimes when you pray you know you
[1:47:40] know you may not see a dream or or or
[1:47:42] see a vision or hear anything but you
[1:47:45] know you feel led to go a certain way
[1:47:48] just go right ahead if if you are wrong
[1:47:52] and the matter is in prayer God will
[1:47:54] correct you he will make sure you are
[1:47:56] not wrong as long as you prayed over it
[1:48:00] Hallelujah and in the pamon church age
[1:48:02] brother bam says something here he says
[1:48:04] so balam got Israel to for to commit
[1:48:06] fornication do you know that physical
[1:48:09] fornication is the very same spirit that
[1:48:12] lies in organized
[1:48:16] religion let me remove my court so that
[1:48:18] I can show you this properly if the holy
[1:48:21] spirit will help me tonight amen I'll be
[1:48:23] able to paint you a picture of what the
[1:48:26] message is hallelujah he said do you
[1:48:30] know that physical fornication physical
[1:48:33] fornication is the very same spirit that
[1:48:36] lies in organized
[1:48:39] religion now what is organized religion
[1:48:42] organized religion is what we call
[1:48:44] denomination and I'll tell you right
[1:48:46] here before I continue organized
[1:48:47] religion is what is led by man-made
[1:48:50] systems
[1:48:53] organized religion is what is led by man
[1:48:56] but not the word and the Holy Ghost but
[1:48:58] this message is not organized religion
[1:49:01] this message is beyond organized
[1:49:03] religion a pastor can backslide a
[1:49:06] preacher can backslide but we stay firm
[1:49:09] planted in Christ why because we are not
[1:49:11] under organized religion we are led by
[1:49:14] the word we are led by the Holy
[1:49:16] Ghost and then here he says so bam got
[1:49:20] Israel to commit fornication do you know
[1:49:23] that physical fornication is the very
[1:49:24] same spirit that lies in organized
[1:49:26] religion I said that the spirit of
[1:49:28] fornication is the spirit of
[1:49:32] organization and all fornicators will
[1:49:35] have their place in the Lake of Fire
[1:49:38] that includes the spiritual fornicators
[1:49:40] and we are going to see the spiritual
[1:49:41] fornicators tonight that is what God
[1:49:44] thinks of organization yes sir the whole
[1:49:47] malayah the whole and her daughters will
[1:49:50] be in the Lake of Fire and then he says
[1:49:53] denominations are not of God and let me
[1:49:55] ask you a question what is a
[1:49:57] denomination a denomination is oh God
[1:50:00] help us a denomination is a system that
[1:50:02] you know draws boundaries and it says if
[1:50:05] you are not a part of us if you are not
[1:50:07] a part of this group you are wrong that
[1:50:10] is a
[1:50:12] denomination that is a denomination that
[1:50:15] says everybody else is wrong we are the
[1:50:17] right ones oh God help us that that kind
[1:50:20] of spirit doesn't enter into the message
[1:50:23] you see they see other groups as
[1:50:25] backsliders because they don't see it
[1:50:26] the way their Pastor preaches it they
[1:50:28] see other groups as if they're wrong
[1:50:30] because they are not part of their group
[1:50:32] sometimes not even because they're
[1:50:33] preaching wrong Doctrine but because
[1:50:34] they're not part of their
[1:50:37] group andam says that is a denomination
[1:50:40] it's a spirit of organization but we
[1:50:43] have been liberated from that why
[1:50:46] because we are a nation under God we are
[1:50:48] not a nation under man look the if you
[1:50:51] want one if you want want to be a True
[1:50:53] Believer of the message you should take
[1:50:54] your eyes Beyond a man and look at what
[1:50:58] God is doing in your life in this
[1:51:01] hour this message amen is God being
[1:51:04] personalized in you it's not about a a
[1:51:08] denominational idea Doctrine or even
[1:51:11] understanding or Revelation no it is it
[1:51:13] is more than that it is Christ being
[1:51:16] personalized in your life it's not just
[1:51:18] some good teaching or some good ideas no
[1:51:20] it is God being made person in your life
[1:51:23] whereby you can be sure whatever you
[1:51:25] doing you are confident because you know
[1:51:26] God is leading
[1:51:30] you brother bam said I think it was in
[1:51:34] the second Church age he said that this
[1:51:36] man I think it was is was polyup said
[1:51:39] the polyup was supposed to be the church
[1:51:41] age messenger of that age but Iran as
[1:51:44] his
[1:51:45] student became the church age messenger
[1:51:48] why because polyup leaned towards
[1:51:51] organiz organized religion you see God
[1:51:53] hates it God hates it you see God hates
[1:52:01] it listen they never have been and never
[1:52:04] will be denominations are not of God
[1:52:06] they never have been and never will be
[1:52:09] when you get that attitude of saying we
[1:52:10] are the only ones and everybody's wrong
[1:52:12] listen dvf is not the only one there are
[1:52:15] many others we just a little PE on the
[1:52:18] beach your preacher is not the only one
[1:52:20] there are many other preachers who
[1:52:21] actually preaching the truth
[1:52:23] even the denominations the people who
[1:52:25] are in the denominations we don't hate
[1:52:27] them the denominations we hate that is
[1:52:29] not of God but the people who are there
[1:52:30] we love we love we want them to come and
[1:52:34] hear the
[1:52:35] truth it is a wrong spirit that
[1:52:39] denomination is a wrong spirit that
[1:52:41] separates the people of God into a
[1:52:44] hierarchy and ly okay it divides the
[1:52:48] church into hierarchy and ladyy
[1:52:52] and and it is therefore a wrong spirit
[1:52:56] that separates the people from the
[1:52:59] people okay so the other church and the
[1:53:02] other church and the other church and
[1:53:03] the other
[1:53:04] church is a wrong spirit separates the
[1:53:07] people from the
[1:53:11] people it's a spirit of
[1:53:13] denominationalism it's a Spirit uh of
[1:53:16] organized religion I'm so glad that God
[1:53:20] Set Me Free from that that God set you
[1:53:22] free from that because this message came
[1:53:24] to liberate Us by the way I don't know
[1:53:26] this denomination people wrote that song
[1:53:28] we have been liberated but we are the
[1:53:30] right people who were supposed to sing
[1:53:32] it we have been liberated from our
[1:53:36] bondage woo let our sons and our
[1:53:39] daughters let us sing our
[1:53:43] freedom why because we have being
[1:53:45] liberated from the chains of religion we
[1:53:48] can look over Amen to a brother who
[1:53:50] believes this message no matter which
[1:53:52] church they come from and we say that is
[1:53:54] my brother that is my
[1:53:57] sister we are the only system of
[1:53:59] religion in the world that operates amen
[1:54:03] under different kind of church
[1:54:04] leadership but we are the same body and
[1:54:07] we agree all over the world worldwide
[1:54:09] worldwide someone could come from as far
[1:54:12] as Australia come here and preach
[1:54:14] something that we all can say Amen what
[1:54:17] do you think that is and we are not
[1:54:19] controlled by a man-made system we don't
[1:54:22] a hierarchy we have no headquarter we
[1:54:24] are oh my God God himself disciplines
[1:54:27] his preachers he sends them he equips
[1:54:29] them he corrects them let me tell you
[1:54:33] this is what you call the message of the
[1:54:37] hour the message of the hour is not
[1:54:39] organized religion someone was telling
[1:54:42] me if you are saying that you don't have
[1:54:43] hierarchy you know one level level Lev
[1:54:47] up up to the upper level if you don't
[1:54:49] have that how do you correct pastors and
[1:54:51] preachers who go wrong we say we don't
[1:54:53] need we don't need hierarchy to correct
[1:54:55] them we have above we have
[1:55:00] above amen the only thing we have is the
[1:55:04] word is the Holy Ghost and as long as
[1:55:07] that man ve off the people will leave
[1:55:13] him in this message we are not followers
[1:55:18] of men and a man we are followers of God
[1:55:21] and the word and the Holy Ghost our
[1:55:25] Prophet brother bam set the precedent he
[1:55:28] said if I ever say anything that is not
[1:55:30] in the word leave it
[1:55:35] alone I tell you friends I'm so glad
[1:55:38] here we are not men
[1:55:44] loyalists there are people who worship
[1:55:46] they pastors more than Jesus we are you
[1:55:49] you did not leave your denomination to
[1:55:50] come here and worship your pastor I
[1:55:52] don't want you to worship me I want you
[1:55:54] to worship this word I want you to
[1:55:56] worship Jesus who died for you who rose
[1:55:59] again who is alive today and can
[1:56:02] actually change your
[1:56:03] life are you hearing me be a Jesus loyal
[1:56:10] man if I'm loyal to him and you are
[1:56:13] loyal to him then we are going to be
[1:56:14] loyal to each other
[1:56:16] Hallelujah H you can call me crazy but I
[1:56:19] know what I'm talking about I know where
[1:56:21] I am standing
[1:56:23] listen let me read you a little more
[1:56:25] here he says denominations are not of
[1:56:28] God they never have been and never will
[1:56:30] be it is a wrong spirit that separates
[1:56:32] the people from of God into hierarchy
[1:56:34] and ly and it is there a wrong spirit
[1:56:37] that separates the people from the
[1:56:38] people that is what organization and
[1:56:40] denominations do in organizing they
[1:56:43] separate themselves from the word of God
[1:56:45] and bring themselves into spiritual
[1:56:49] adultery my God
[1:56:53] whereby they think they the husbands of
[1:56:55] the church ah if you want to quot the
[1:57:00] message and preach a wrong doctr it is
[1:57:01] possible you can even take this Bible
[1:57:02] and and quote and preach a wrong
[1:57:04] Doctrine you see you've had those they
[1:57:06] want to qu the pastor is the husband of
[1:57:08] the church no no is the husband in such
[1:57:11] a way that he is the carrier of the seed
[1:57:15] he doesn't have the seed of his own seed
[1:57:17] but he has the seed of the word okay so
[1:57:20] it's not that it's not that when you
[1:57:23] when you have to bow to the man you have
[1:57:25] to bow to the god in the
[1:57:27] man so we we always have to see beyond
[1:57:31] you see you can easily miss it you have
[1:57:33] to see beyond there are some others who
[1:57:35] devalue pastors and step on them and say
[1:57:37] he's just like me no he's not like you
[1:57:39] he different it's called by God is
[1:57:41] special butam say is a special man right
[1:57:44] every preacher is a special man he not
[1:57:46] he's not he's not a common right but
[1:57:50] look it's not about him it's about he
[1:57:52] who is in
[1:57:55] him now I'll read for you from the saman
[1:57:59] church age here what it says consider
[1:58:01] the thought of blasphemy these of
[1:58:04] Saturn's synagogue we are not
[1:58:07] blaspheming God in this instance though
[1:58:10] that goes without saying but they were
[1:58:12] blaspheming the true
[1:58:14] church so there was certain synagogue in
[1:58:17] thean church age and brother bam says
[1:58:20] this in this in the in this synagogue
[1:58:23] meaning it was also a church but the
[1:58:25] false Church system so they were now
[1:58:27] blaspheming the true church that those
[1:58:29] two Church systems will always be
[1:58:30] together those two seed lines the false
[1:58:32] Vine and the True Vine they will always
[1:58:33] move
[1:58:35] together that's what you're going to see
[1:58:37] working now when they talk about um the
[1:58:40] World Council of churches and they will
[1:58:41] try to divide Us by that the false
[1:58:43] Church system will be the majority they
[1:58:46] would say if these other ones don't join
[1:58:48] us they are the they the cult we should
[1:58:50] kill them we should remove the license
[1:58:52] we should do this and now the church
[1:58:53] shall be persecuted but I am not going
[1:58:55] to wait until that time happens because
[1:58:57] I will be up in up yonder I'll have to
[1:58:59] go in the Rapture I won't wait for that
[1:59:01] because that will happen the tribulation
[1:59:03] I'll not be here my my my so that's why
[1:59:06] we are preaching the way we we can we
[1:59:08] cannot allow anything or anyone to stop
[1:59:11] us we are the
[1:59:14] Unstoppable by don't let anyone or a
[1:59:17] condition stop you from witnessing about
[1:59:19] Christ you only have a short time
[1:59:21] brother Ivan soon you will be dead or
[1:59:23] you'll be long gone but while you have
[1:59:25] the time go and preach go and witness go
[1:59:28] and live the word be a witness however
[1:59:31] way you can
[1:59:33] be allow the Holy Spirit to lead you you
[1:59:36] see here it says you
[1:59:38] know but they were blaspheming the true
[1:59:41] church suddenly as Cain persecuted and
[1:59:44] killed Abel because he came was of that
[1:59:47] Wicked one and as the dead former judaic
[1:59:50] followers Jesus said they were of their
[1:59:53] father the devil they tried to destroy
[1:59:56] the Christians in the first few years of
[1:59:59] the first age now this same group the
[2:00:03] first Vine is even more strongly
[2:00:05] attempting to
[2:00:07] destroy the True Believer in the second
[2:00:09] age and I want to say even in our age
[2:00:12] this Antichrist system will try to
[2:00:13] destroy the True Believer and in every
[2:00:16] age in every place this Antichrist
[2:00:18] spirit will be there following the right
[2:00:21] move of God to try and Destroy them and
[2:00:24] squeeze life out of them but that and he
[2:00:26] says that Antichrist spirit is growing
[2:00:30] and now I I can say it has grown now it
[2:00:32] is ripe listen listen the group that
[2:00:36] inched its way ever so slowly into the
[2:00:39] church by its Deeds do you remember the
[2:00:41] Deeds the Deeds of the what of the
[2:00:44] nicolan do you remember what nicolan
[2:00:46] means nicolan is a spirit that wants to
[2:00:50] control the people man controlling the
[2:00:54] don't go there don't do that don't
[2:00:55] believe that don't accept that don't do
[2:00:56] that don't don't don't don't don't so
[2:00:59] you see man is fearing
[2:01:01] oh my pastor oh my church oh my my
[2:01:05] Reverend oh my Bishop oh my so you see
[2:01:08] they suppressed and they told dogmas and
[2:01:10] Creeds that are not in the bible let me
[2:01:13] tell you don't believe what I'm telling
[2:01:15] you because I'm your pastor believe it
[2:01:16] because is in the word or else you'll be
[2:01:18] found to be under the spirit of nicolan
[2:01:21] you see it's a it became a de so now it
[2:01:24] was at this time no longer fearing
[2:01:27] exposure but it openly organized in a
[2:01:29] group of its own assembling and is
[2:01:32] coming against the true church in un
[2:01:35] undisguised hostility now when I said
[2:01:39] this was unorganized Antichrist church I
[2:01:42] am giving you the truth from the
[2:01:44] authentic history authenticated history
[2:01:46] listen this is I'm quoting for you are
[2:01:47] you hearing what I'm saying the first
[2:01:50] church founded in Rome we will tress its
[2:01:53] history in the pamman church age it had
[2:01:56] already turned the truth of God into a
[2:01:58] Lie by introducing a Pagan religion with
[2:02:01] Christian names and meaning by the
[2:02:03] second age it was so Pagan though
[2:02:06] claiming to be the true church that
[2:02:09] polyup came about
[2:02:11] 1,500 years and 100 miles at a very old
[2:02:15] age this guy was a very old man at this
[2:02:18] time he walked and moved for 1,500 miles
[2:02:22] you know and he came to plead with them
[2:02:25] to turn back to the original they would
[2:02:27] not do
[2:02:29] it they had a solid
[2:02:32] hierarchy it's just like going to the
[2:02:34] Catholic church now or the Anglican
[2:02:35] church or one of those denominations and
[2:02:37] tell them to break their hierarchies and
[2:02:39] hear the word brother G told me a
[2:02:41] testimony that moved me he said he
[2:02:44] almost baptized a Catholic
[2:02:48] priest and the way it happened was you
[2:02:51] know he preached to this guy and this
[2:02:52] guy was like ah is that in the Bible
[2:02:55] I've never seen it
[2:02:57] ah and then uh the next thing was like
[2:03:01] yeah yeah sure I can do it this the one
[2:03:03] and then he was like oh
[2:03:06] wait and then the man said no we can't
[2:03:08] question the
[2:03:09] church and that's how he missed it
[2:03:12] that's how he missed it you see he they
[2:03:15] would not do turn back to the original
[2:03:18] they had they had a solid hierarchy and
[2:03:21] a solid organ ization and a complete
[2:03:23] departure from the
[2:03:24] word this then is Saturn's synagogue
[2:03:28] full of blasphemy in which we in which
[2:03:31] we already the seeds of the doctrine of
[2:03:33] the
[2:03:34] nanism that's why you cannot you cannot
[2:03:36] change a denomination but you can change
[2:03:38] the people in the denominations we are
[2:03:40] not called to go and preach the
[2:03:42] denominations but we are called to go
[2:03:44] and tell the people who are there come
[2:03:45] out of all my people don't be partakers
[2:03:48] of our sins Hallelujah and then it says
[2:03:52] in which were already the seeds of the
[2:03:54] of and which would shortly be the actual
[2:03:58] seed or the power of satanic
[2:04:01] religion and this is exactly right for
[2:04:03] Revelation 22:9 B he says does not say
[2:04:07] these people of certain synagogue but it
[2:04:09] says it says
[2:04:11] they it says but it says they are they
[2:04:15] are not the people of but they are sat
[2:04:18] synagogue
[2:04:20] itself now let me continue here it says
[2:04:23] this Spirit of antichrist is not
[2:04:26] new this is not something that just came
[2:04:29] in the church ages it has been here all
[2:04:32] along to get a clear understanding of
[2:04:34] how it works how it it goes against God
[2:04:37] and taxes and sorry and takes over in
[2:04:39] the church you know it can take over
[2:04:40] even in a message church or even in any
[2:04:42] church if they're not
[2:04:45] careful how it takes over in the church
[2:04:47] look if you want to know look at the Old
[2:04:49] Testament and see it there let us exam
[2:04:51] in this Spirit as it was manifested in
[2:04:54] Israel as she came out of Egypt to the
[2:04:57] church to be the church in the
[2:05:00] wilderness and whenever the church is
[2:05:02] coming out of Egypt that Spirit also
[2:05:06] comes whenever that church is coming out
[2:05:09] of Egypt Whenever there is a beginning
[2:05:11] of a church that Spirit comes so
[2:05:14] ministers have to watch churches have to
[2:05:18] watch pastors have to watch
[2:05:22] just as the early church started out
[2:05:24] under the pure Ministry of the holy
[2:05:26] spirit with signs and wonders and
[2:05:28] manifestations such as prophecy tongues
[2:05:31] interpretation wisdom knowledge and
[2:05:33] healing so in the days of Israel when
[2:05:36] they left Egypt they were under the
[2:05:38] leadership of what of the spirit of God
[2:05:41] manifesting in the
[2:05:43] gifts I want the same spirit of God
[2:05:47] manifesting in the gifts signs and
[2:05:50] wonders in our midst
[2:05:54] God was the leader of the people
[2:05:55] everybody say God was the
[2:05:57] leader and he says actually he was their
[2:06:00] King he was a father King he took care
[2:06:03] of Israel like a man cares for his
[2:06:05] family he fed them F their battles
[2:06:08] smooth away their difficulties and
[2:06:11] settled their problems he will do the
[2:06:12] same for
[2:06:16] you a church that trusts in God that
[2:06:19] believes in God God will the same for
[2:06:25] them
[2:06:28] Hallelujah they are preachers who cannot
[2:06:30] preach unless they have
[2:06:32] financial
[2:06:37] support they can't preach unless someone
[2:06:40] gives them money to start a church I've
[2:06:43] just showed you the pictures here this
[2:06:45] is a work that started not because this
[2:06:47] man or this young man was pumped up with
[2:06:49] money but because he was oby the
[2:06:52] leadership of the spirit and let me tell
[2:06:54] you even our church here has started the
[2:06:56] same
[2:06:58] way it's the same Holy Ghost it's the
[2:07:01] same fire some of you are sited here are
[2:07:04] preachers and will go start churches but
[2:07:06] you know it should start the same
[2:07:08] way God should be behind you to
[2:07:10] vindicate himself to prove I am the Lord
[2:07:13] and I fail not to prove is the same
[2:07:16] yester done
[2:07:19] forever he just busy himself over them
[2:07:22] they were the only oh my God oh my God
[2:07:25] God bused himself over them I want God
[2:07:27] to busy himself over us woo they were
[2:07:32] the only nation to which he was truly
[2:07:34] God we the message Believers are the
[2:07:36] only nation are the only church to which
[2:07:39] God is truly
[2:07:42] God but you see one day Israel the
[2:07:45] Israel the church Israel they got
[2:07:47] looking around and they saw the
[2:07:49] Philistines and other nations with Kings
[2:07:52] over them so it caught their eyes and
[2:07:55] they decided that they ought to humanize
[2:07:57] their
[2:07:59] leadership so they wanted a king now God
[2:08:02] was going to humanize the leadership
[2:08:03] himself in the person of the Lord Jesus
[2:08:06] Christ but they got ahead of him Satan
[2:08:09] knew the plan of God so he puts it in
[2:08:12] the hearts of the people to get ahead of
[2:08:14] God the word you see even in a family
[2:08:18] you the man you are not the leader you
[2:08:20] are not the ruler ah if you do that you
[2:08:23] as a man you have a spirit of nanism on
[2:08:26] you now that's I I've taken to another
[2:08:28] level
[2:08:29] now you the husband you must be inspired
[2:08:33] by the Holy Ghost to lead your wife to
[2:08:35] lead your family you must be under the
[2:08:37] unction of the power of the Holy Ghost
[2:08:39] because you see like the pastor is not
[2:08:41] the man the leader himself right he must
[2:08:43] be under the power of the Holy Ghost and
[2:08:45] the what and the word same way Same
[2:08:49] Spirit but when you say when you get to
[2:08:51] say me I am your husband I have said not
[2:08:54] going to church today okay let me ask
[2:08:57] you where is it in the Bible that your
[2:09:00] wife should not go to church when you
[2:09:01] have saved the Bible says that all
[2:09:04] Saints should what should attend church
[2:09:06] without forsaking it right now you you
[2:09:08] have a spirited of nianis that's why you
[2:09:09] are stopping your wife from going to
[2:09:10] church you see you are conquering her
[2:09:13] you are conquering her we are not
[2:09:15] conquerors of our wives amen the Holy
[2:09:17] Ghost in us should lead us Amen to rule
[2:09:21] over our families with
[2:09:25] love amen as Christ cherishes and loves
[2:09:29] his wife we too should love our wives
[2:09:30] and cherish them because they a part of
[2:09:33] us you see it's the same thing you you
[2:09:36] find also women sometimes they have a
[2:09:38] spirit of Jezebel on them a spirit of
[2:09:40] Jezebel is that one which does not
[2:09:41] listen to the husband you know it wants
[2:09:43] to control and sit you know it was
[2:09:46] seated upon many Waters Spirit of
[2:09:48] Jezebel spirit of denominationalism and
[2:09:51] Rel
[2:09:52] comes upon a woman and she can't listen
[2:09:53] to her to her husband and she says I
[2:09:56] have my own my own money my own this my
[2:09:58] own spia Spirit ofia it has taken over
[2:10:03] you see I have my own this my own my you
[2:10:06] as a sister as a woman you don't have
[2:10:08] anything of your own you have your lord
[2:10:10] and your lord is your husband you must
[2:10:11] submit 100% not 99 but
[2:10:15] 100% just like the church submits to
[2:10:18] Christ 100%
[2:10:21] the church have nothing of its own the
[2:10:24] church is at the mercies of Jesus Christ
[2:10:27] the husband the head the church is the
[2:10:30] body and he is the savior of the body so
[2:10:34] you see it says when they approached oh
[2:10:37] my I did not notice that it is 8:37 just
[2:10:39] give me a few more minutes and try to
[2:10:41] wrap this up and when they approach
[2:10:43] Samuel ask and asked I must have missed
[2:10:46] you H I'm preaching
[2:10:49] endlessly ah let me try to to see how to
[2:10:53] are you enjoying this tonight
[2:10:55] church when they approached Samuel and
[2:10:57] asked for a King Samuel was so dismay
[2:10:59] that his heart almost failed him God had
[2:11:03] been leading his people through this
[2:11:05] consecrated scripture Vindicated prophet
[2:11:07] and he felt that he had been rejected so
[2:11:10] he gathered the people and pleaded with
[2:11:12] them not to turn away from The God Who
[2:11:15] had carried them like children and
[2:11:17] prospered them and blessed them but they
[2:11:19] persisted so they say to Samuel you have
[2:11:21] never been wrong in your leading you
[2:11:23] have never been dishonest in your
[2:11:24] financial dealings you have not done
[2:11:26] your best to keep us in line with the
[2:11:28] word of God we appreciate the Miracles
[2:11:30] wisdom provision and protection of God
[2:11:32] we believe in it we like it and
[2:11:33] furthermore we don't want to be without
[2:11:35] it but it's just what we want a king to
[2:11:39] lead us to battle now of course when we
[2:11:42] go out to battle it is still Our
[2:11:44] intention to have the priests go with
[2:11:47] Judah with Judah following and and we
[2:11:49] will blow the trumpets and shout and
[2:11:51] sing We don't intend to stop any of that
[2:11:54] but but we want a king who is one of us
[2:11:58] to lead us and God said to Samuel see
[2:12:02] they have not rejected you but they have
[2:12:05] rejected me from ruling over
[2:12:07] them God wants to be the ruler over his
[2:12:10] own church can you say
[2:12:12] amen God Wants to Rule you brother God
[2:12:15] Wants to Rule you sister can you say
[2:12:17] Amen to that you should submit yourself
[2:12:20] to the rulers of God he wants to be the
[2:12:23] leader of your life how tragic that was
[2:12:27] L did they realize that when they were
[2:12:29] asking God to let them be like the rest
[2:12:30] of the world they were rejecting him
[2:12:32] because God had ordained that his people
[2:12:35] act different from the world they are
[2:12:37] not of the world and they don't like
[2:12:39] look like the world we are not of the
[2:12:40] world don't even look like the world
[2:12:42] they don't act like the world can you
[2:12:43] say Amen to that if you believe it they
[2:12:45] are crucified unto the world and the
[2:12:48] world is crucified unto them amen you
[2:12:52] see the one difference between Israel
[2:12:54] now I'm trying to bring it to a close
[2:12:58] can you follow me as we trying to landar
[2:12:59] this plane tonight you see the one
[2:13:02] difference between Israel and the rest
[2:13:03] of the Nations was what
[2:13:06] God put God to one side and Israel was
[2:13:09] like any other Nation when Samson cut
[2:13:12] off his hair he was like any other man
[2:13:15] put the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[2:13:16] aside and the church is nothing but the
[2:13:19] world with God is name attached to it
[2:13:22] you see now if you put the leadership of
[2:13:24] the Holy Spirit aside you are nothing
[2:13:26] but an organized
[2:13:30] religion the world and the church are
[2:13:33] all of the same lamp just like Jacob and
[2:13:36] Esau were of the same parents but the
[2:13:39] spirit of God makes the
[2:13:41] difference
[2:13:43] woo it doesn't matter if you call
[2:13:46] yourself a Christian anyone can do that
[2:13:49] the point is where all not you have the
[2:13:51] spirit of God in you for without that
[2:13:54] Spirit you are a
[2:13:57] Repro without that SP your
[2:14:00] what it's not my
[2:14:02] words you are none of his H and he says
[2:14:07] now not too long ago I asked a lady if
[2:14:11] she you know let me tell you this this
[2:14:13] just came to me right now the church is
[2:14:14] not led by
[2:14:15] program the church is not by even even
[2:14:18] if me as your pastor I will call you I
[2:14:20] say s come now what we going to do here
[2:14:23] you have to sing only one song you
[2:14:24] invite one special song and then now we
[2:14:27] do this and then the song the special
[2:14:30] singers tell them not to also sing for
[2:14:32] more than a minute and then now you come
[2:14:35] you see you are led by the word by the
[2:14:38] pastor so the pastor has given you
[2:14:40] program program is good oh I'm not
[2:14:42] saying it's not good it's good oh if you
[2:14:44] not have program you're going to be
[2:14:46] unprogrammed and if you don't have
[2:14:47] program you're going to be confused
[2:14:49] right so you need program but we are not
[2:14:51] led by
[2:14:52] program we are led by the spirit so you
[2:14:55] will come and a sister will sing a song
[2:14:57] and people will go in prayer people will
[2:14:59] and then you you would say sister it's
[2:15:01] more than a minute it's more than a
[2:15:02] minute give me the microphone ah brother
[2:15:05] you are not led by the spirit you Le by
[2:15:07] your pastor you see so the song Lead has
[2:15:10] to be lad by the Holy Spirit Pastor has
[2:15:12] to be lad by the Holy Spirit musicians
[2:15:13] have to be led by the Holy Spirit
[2:15:15] everybody has to be le by the Holy
[2:15:16] Spirit you see because you know you have
[2:15:18] to to do d d d do three times and then
[2:15:21] you you you do it and the Holy Spirit
[2:15:23] leaves no you have to flow you if you're
[2:15:27] playing flow with the spirit know what
[2:15:29] you are doing let the Holy Spirit lead
[2:15:34] you if you a wife be leid by the spirit

[2:15:38] your preacher a pastor be led by the
[2:15:41] spirit may God help us Church to be Leed
[2:15:43] by the Holy
[2:15:44] Spirit hallelujah oh my oh my I want to
[2:15:49] try and finish I want to try and finish
[2:15:52] I have about a paragraph or so let me
[2:15:54] let me bring it to a close if the plan
[2:15:56] doesn't Lear properly some of you may
[2:15:57] suffocate let me just finish this
[2:15:59] properly says not too long ago I asked a
[2:16:01] lady if she was a Christian she said to
[2:16:03] me I will have you know sir that I burn
[2:16:06] a candle every
[2:16:07] night and then he said what in the world
[2:16:10] has it got to do with
[2:16:12] it he says I'm a Methodist I'm a Baptist
[2:16:16] I'm a Pentecostal I'm a I'm a dvf
[2:16:19] member so what that hasn't a thing to do
[2:16:23] with it it is the holy ghost or
[2:16:27] Parish well starting way back there in
[2:16:30] the first church the people got to
[2:16:32] thinking and reasoning how to improve on
[2:16:34] God the Deeds of the nians began showing
[2:16:37] themselves then a group formed they
[2:16:40] drifted away from the pattern of the
[2:16:41] word and all it takes is just one word
[2:16:44] changed and all that little even then
[2:16:47] livens the whole lamb he that he that
[2:16:49] offends e in one point of the law is
[2:16:51] guilty of all Eve just changed one word
[2:16:54] that will do it and when that certain
[2:16:56] centered group was formed it began to
[2:16:58] Hur and fight through
[2:17:00] Believers insisting they were aliens
[2:17:04] that they were the yet they were the
[2:17:05] church of god notice how organization
[2:17:08] breeds hatred did you hear that
[2:17:11] organization does what the way you know
[2:17:14] people are coming from a church where
[2:17:16] they're being fed on the word when they
[2:17:18] meet you who is coming from another
[2:17:19] church they will have so much love for
[2:17:21] you as if they come from the same
[2:17:25] church whereby you meet a brother from
[2:17:27] evening light and you see him as your
[2:17:29] brother from the same church whereby you
[2:17:32] meet a brother from whatever church and
[2:17:33] you love him and see him as your brother
[2:17:35] but you see where you H
[2:17:38] someone there is a wrong Spirit of
[2:17:40] organized religion on you and you need
[2:17:42] to repent you see you must always have
[2:17:46] love the says if you have love one for
[2:17:48] another then the world will know you are
[2:17:50] mighty disciples my God give us love
[2:17:53] love for one another love for our
[2:17:55] brothers love for our sisters no matter
[2:17:57] which church they attain I don't want to
[2:17:59] know about their Church even if their
[2:18:01] Doctrine is a little bit different from
[2:18:02] ours I don't care as long as they
[2:18:04] believe this word they are my
[2:18:08] brothers that's why our Prophet told us
[2:18:10] the only bis of this Fellowship is Anan
[2:18:14] living it is not even wrong Doctrine a
[2:18:17] person can believe some wrong Doctrine
[2:18:19] but as long as they're your brother they
[2:18:20] your brother brother leave that long
[2:18:22] doct alone and still love them even if
[2:18:25] they are in the denominations love them
[2:18:27] don't just say this one is from Miracle
[2:18:29] Center no if he claims to believe Jesus
[2:18:31] receive him warmly and love him even if
[2:18:33] he has she has earings on whatever love
[2:18:36] her anyhow and the love of Christ in you
[2:18:38] will attract her to know about your God
[2:18:41] and she will believe she'll be baptized
[2:18:43] in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and
[2:18:44] the earrings will get
[2:18:46] lost but you see we have got our self
[2:18:49] righteous religion thinking we have it
[2:18:52] all and we are the best and nobody else
[2:18:54] has it like us that is the spirit of
[2:18:56] organized religion it is not the spirit
[2:18:58] of Jesus Christ you see friends we have
[2:19:02] to love one another now love does not
[2:19:04] mean you do what they do no brother bam
[2:19:07] said the only basis of excommunication
[2:19:09] or disfellowship is someone who is
[2:19:11] living unclean life and refusing to
[2:19:17] repent not even even if he lives unclean
[2:19:19] life and he depents his right but we're
[2:19:21] talking about the person who lives anle
[2:19:23] life and is CAU and is refusing to
[2:19:26] accept it is refusing to repent and he's
[2:19:27] continuing to live that kind of life
[2:19:28] that one he he should be excommunicated
[2:19:31] like in a lightening because he's going
[2:19:34] to bring a wrong speed among us but you
[2:19:36] see wrong Doctrine is not a basis for
[2:19:39] disfellowship is not a basis for
[2:19:40] excommunication we must always love our
[2:19:42] brother even if they believe something
[2:19:44] that we don't believe oh dvf may you
[2:19:47] receive this in your hearts see you
[2:19:49] should love your brother love your
[2:19:51] sister because you see if they see us
[2:19:52] that we have love for one another they
[2:19:54] will know we are his
[2:19:56] disciples you see not is how
[2:19:58] organization breeds hatred organization
[2:20:00] is the one which what brings hatred it
[2:20:03] destroys
[2:20:04] Fellowship it makes bitterness it makes
[2:20:07] bitterness these are things are in the
[2:20:09] message they're not my inventions that
[2:20:11] is what m means this is what smana was
[2:20:14] full of bitterness a root of bitterness
[2:20:18] defiles many so more and more defilement
[2:20:24] was coming in as musicians
[2:20:27] come every age would feel the
[2:20:33] scars of
[2:20:35] bitterness and even our age even our
[2:20:38] generation is feeling the scars of
[2:20:40] bitterness you find people having
[2:20:42] bitterness against each other may God
[2:20:45] help us Brethren to love one
[2:20:47] another from our
[2:20:49] hearts whether I I understand what the
[2:20:52] brother understands or whether I
[2:20:53] disagree with him or whether he comes
[2:20:54] from another fellowship I don't agree
[2:20:55] it's all right it's all right it's all
[2:20:59] right Christ died for them he died for
[2:21:01] me too I know what I believe you see
[2:21:03] some people hate others and they are
[2:21:04] bitter and they they u a lot why because
[2:21:06] they are not confident but the G told us
[2:21:09] confidence without ego you love each
[2:21:13] other and you're confident where you are
[2:21:15] you're
[2:21:17] like he believes to LS he believes for
[2:21:21] he believes oh he's going to change me
[2:21:23] oh come on be confident in what you are
[2:21:25] and what you believe right yes doesn't
[2:21:29] mean that oh I love my brother who is a
[2:21:31] Catholic until I I go to attend this
[2:21:33] Catholic Church there is a problem with
[2:21:35] you that's not love because love covers
[2:21:39] a multitude of sins but it does not
[2:21:41] rejoice in iniquity see see so when you
[2:21:45] see someone who you know believe in the
[2:21:47] wrong stuff you will love them to
[2:21:49] correct them love is correct corve you
[2:21:51] not love them to deal with what they
[2:21:53] doing but you to to agree with them but
[2:21:56] you love them to correct them and
[2:21:59] friends the leadership of the Holy
[2:22:00] Spirit pays
[2:22:02] off when I saw what God has done in aasa
[2:22:05] and what God is doing in
[2:22:07] that young man's life I marveled I
[2:22:11] marveled I marveled because I saw I said
[2:22:14] truly these things is what brother abam
[2:22:17] said it
[2:22:18] works he went to aasa when no no one
[2:22:20] believed in
[2:22:23] him I quite frankly I told him I'm
[2:22:27] behind you I support you
[2:22:29] but I also had my
[2:22:32] questions but you see it was God's
[2:22:35] leadership and God stood behind that and
[2:22:37] you've seen those
[2:22:39] pictures and now we can stand with what
[2:22:41] God is standing with because it is out
[2:22:45] of the leadership of the Holy Spirit and
[2:22:47] that's what we need to do we need to be
[2:22:49] led by the spirit
[2:22:51] we need to be led by the spirit we were
[2:22:53] led by the spirit to start a fellowship
[2:22:54] in an but you see I was led by the
[2:22:57] spirit to start that Fellowship to open
[2:22:59] the door there I do not know how many
[2:23:01] will come there but you can be led by
[2:23:03] the Holy Spirit to always come there and
[2:23:05] support to send money and to do whatever
[2:23:07] even if you're giving an offering be
[2:23:08] laid by the spirit don't just give four
[2:23:10] you just say this one 50 is much let me
[2:23:13] give 20 you see you being led by flesh
[2:23:16] but if you led by the spirit you will
[2:23:17] pray say God what would you have me give
[2:23:20] sometimes we talk about needs here oh
[2:23:21] there is a need to there's a need but
[2:23:23] you pray say oh God what would you have
[2:23:25] me to give right now this church needs a
[2:23:27] lot of things the church in in in haasa
[2:23:29] they need a lot of things they need a
[2:23:31] church building of their own they need
[2:23:33] even before they get there they need
[2:23:35] rent of a good place a good building and
[2:23:38] they you know they need a lot of a lot
[2:23:40] of
[2:23:41] resources but you see if you hear things
[2:23:43] like that you say oh God what would you
[2:23:45] have me to do it might be just something
[2:23:47] very little but if the Holy Spirit has
[2:23:49] led you to do it he knows where exactly
[2:23:51] it is going to
[2:23:52] go praise
[2:23:56] God
[2:23:57] hallelujah let us stand on our
[2:24:03] feet just
[2:24:04] feel our presence of the Holy Spirit
[2:24:07] here with us

[2:24:16] [Music]

[2:24:25] egos or our own ideas or our own
[2:24:29] Ambitions many times we make wrong
[2:24:31] decisions based on our
[2:24:34] feelings but we understand it has
[2:24:36] nothing to do with us
