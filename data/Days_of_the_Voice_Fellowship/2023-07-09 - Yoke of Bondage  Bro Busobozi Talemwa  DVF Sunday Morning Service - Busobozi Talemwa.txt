know that I'll be away for a few days in Nairobi um that is a beginning with this this Tuesday the Lord willing [Music] for meetings scheduled there by the grace of God Isaac our last year Camp speaker in Nairobi and so uh they want they they would like me to speak for them so the Lord willing I'll be with them this coming week it is if I go by Road it will be my first time to drive to Nairobi um I've driven to kaimosi which is a bit closer I've also driven to kericho where we also had the meetings there but this would be the first to Nairobi is very ready to receive us there brother Ken also Kenny so remember me in prayers um so I'd like us to now stand and go to the reading of the world before after we we read this scripture I'd like us to sing A Chorus of a certain song I wanted to sing the whole song but I'm not quite I'm not so sure whether I'm prepared to sing the whole song so uh but I love the song and it is on the theme of what I want to speak to you and um Brother Joseph Brother Joseph will try to back me up he also doesn't know it very well so I don't know is there anybody here who knows the song and writes possess your inheritance very well and you can sing it on remember what is she outside she has not a reason upper hand which means also she doesn't know it well so we will just try to sing it it's just the words it's not um the the vocals but it's the word that matters so we are reading out of Matthew 11 28. Mateo is it's a very common scripture I'm reading in the name of the Lord come unto me all ye that labor and a heavy laden and I will give you rest take up take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls I think brother these are are just the monitors you need to want to manage the echo coming from the monitors take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am make and lowly in heart and he shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light Mateo is [Music] um okay brother show me if you can get to the piano if you can please I'd like um brother Peter was supposed to be here also much earlier last night but he had issues on the road so we're all worried thinking that he had a uh it's not by the way if you're driving it's not good for you to travel to drive at night we want you alive um there was a portal a very big pothole actually said it's not very big but it's very sharp around after or between um close to mabida worldwide so it so [Music] after him well here with the brothers and he kept on telling me too I mean by the time I finished talking with him it was about 20 more cars and let him fill them with oil you are free you are free so when the Creditor comes to take away your land show him your account tell him it was said long ago now I can tell the world I have heard the trumpet sounds amen freedom from all body Liberty by which Christ has set you today amen [Music] hallelujah thank you Jesus for you set us free rise possession heritance if you can sing along this season if you believe arise [Music] by which Christ set you free oh arise for this is you believe he arise [Music] by which Christ set you free that I am free I have had a trumpet sound to believe [Music] has given me peace [Music] eyes possessed you inheritance which Christ set you free everybody now arise to believe they arise which Christ said can you now join me for the last time possession inheritance hallelujah oh this is set you free give the club a praise for the Lord who set us free and died for us hallelujah bondage but you already know that someone has said to you there is a song We singed which says he set me free from the chains I thank Jesus I thank God for he set me free I don't know whether you have ever seen a free man a free woman will be happy a free man a free woman foreign between the two natures each of us have those two Natures praise the Lord so we are going to Romans 7. Brother Sam I need my real sound Romans 7 14. if you can take your Bible and open there with me if you have a Bible at all those with Bible say Amen as your opening without Bibles you can hold your peace no problem foreign so we're reading out of Romans chapter 7 verse 14 and we are going to read a few verses out of there so we can be able to see how he explains these two natures [Music] so we're beginning from 14. for we know that the law is spiritual but I am Kano sold under sin TV Hallelujah for that which I do allow not for what I would that do I not but what I hate that do I change if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that it is just trying to bring me back to do what is good he began by saying the law is spiritual attention so you see on Wednesday I spoke on legalism [Applause] because what I want to do I don't find myself doing so I can concern that the law is good but he says now then it is no more I that do it but sin that do anything since meaning within me I have a desire to do well but I find myself doing this because it always keeps me away from doing that but then he says it is not I that do those bad things [Music] for I know that in me that is in my flesh there is no good thing oh my God I don't know whether you knew that is I want to say to you there is no good things foreign he says there is no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find notes I'll not ask you to raise up your hands but I'll ask you how many have ever felt that way you you have a desire loving you which has been tied up and put somewhere in a glass and then it rains and the water begins to flow when it sees outside and says the wallow I really really want to do that [Music] you can try to keep it inside you can try to keep it inside but actually you can never change its nature does because it has been a peak to begin with foreign foreign foreign it is no more either do it but sin that do anything [Music] Cola they say Hallelujah man hallelujah hallelujah someone asked me is it possible for a seat of a baptized son or daughter of God to make a mistake um oh yes because the body you're wearing is not baptized with the Holy ghosts look you see then who is the judge of that it's God who looks at the internet this is someone who is a child of God you cannot utterly say Let Me Go and sing God will forgive me you can never do that because within your heart something will tell you you cannot do that you may try please find yourself in an era where Sangamon Soviet was taken not one Guru and a Mr in an area well then of course if that happens what is going to happen afterwards shows which seed is in you is you have two people here one is Cain and another is you see you can see what they did after dinner could not repent look at look at Peter and look at uh what is the name of this Judas you know when when when when Judas both of them did the same scene and Peter was a seed of God that's what the Bible says actually Jesus said that Judas maybe was the Devil Himself of God is God and therefore that's why he called Judas of the Devil Himself so when when when Peter sinned over you know now how did his sin he rejected Christ Jesus Christ foreign then he came before some people who say that there is no repentance in a message because everything is done the price Redemption has been paid we don't repentance yes yes let me tell you we still repent we still repent to change that's the old time Holy Spirit equipment they know that God is real who don't know how to manage money they have little wisdom too so you see you that's new he had wisdom I guess and with wisdom he used reasonings see I know you're powerful so let me betray you so that we can also get the money I wanted to remember this is the same man who once told Jesus let us sell the oil and and have money to use it um and so at this time Judas Judah knew what he was doing he didn't do it out of an era okay he planned sin yeah but he knew also he had a way out they said let me get this money can't finish sentencing so that when I betray you when you reuse your device and so he watched when he came they agreed with the other man he was going to kiss that one I and Judas was there now you know what he must have shot them I know you can do this Jesus went down yes I don't know how Judas felt your master felt the anointing over him over here the tingling in his foreign foreign Jose and at that moment Judas Jesus gave himself yes to the Pharisees what is happening something must have gone wrong with my calculations that he was a real sinner he didn't mean to sing and at that moment foreign all humans can sin but the seed of God can never plan sinning foreign hallelujah amen and at that moment he says that when I would do good evil is present with me verse for the light in the law of God after the inward man but I see another law in my members worrying against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members and he says who shall deliver me from the body of this day yes you know what Psalms 51 says behold I was sharpened in iniquity and then send it my mother conceive me foreign [Applause] foreign you can have the Holy Spirit in you in that new nature of yours but let me ask you which one do you think will be stronger money the one you feed most the white one because it's white and many Christians are like that because God is powerful but if you don't feed that word if you don't feed you're a white dog you will live in a defeated life you will live just live in sin but the purpose of the world is to come this nature this York it's you know you know it has yoked us we keep us in bondage you see the law could not Deliver Us from this York the anime I had a picture of a York but I forgot to give it to the brothers um but brother Isaac if you can find one put it up for the people who are online now the York like we don't know it much yet because we don't use them a lot can I have two brothers who are ready to act like a cow here good actors I'll not make a full of sisters oh Brothers God bless you come about this is a very difficult we want someone who is like a cow foreign [Applause] so all you do category I don't have anything else and begin to whip the cows they begin moving but these ones are not moving you this is my seemingly foreign [Music] [Music] Chicago and if it's binding you let me tell you my cry like Paul cry or cows they are people who can lie to you do we have a good liar here of course we are in church many of you may not raise your hands when they start to learn even the dust will will move even those things which you don't need to lie where you find them hey thank you for getting the best ones because Summer you find yourself in your bedroom or somewhere you sit and think about yourself the Yoke of theft hey do you know let me tell you this is a York the moment you steal the first time one time there's a robust came in my house I was not married to them and robbed all my phones [Music] I used police and we caught this this month I didn't know how he entered so when I found the man at the police rather whipped him and so they were asking him questions it wasn't his first time you know I had this kind of you know I was really hurting oh how could he have entered my room but when I saw him in that conditions people do these things because they're Underpants because I I asked him a question why do you do this is a better life and you looked at me and you look down of course he was saying you don't know what you're talking about I also don't want to do this let me tell you the children of God when they sing they detest sin baby they don't want to do it but they find themselves because of that other nature the the Yoke of mother is you see and for them they feel nothing they murdered and blood Spirits the Yoke of conversations are you hearing me I'm coming down to our address this morning and in the next few minutes before I get done I wanted to just stay put and listen to this is a desire or rather having or showing a great desire to possess something belonging to someone else [Music] India [Applause] hey why do you think we have the get rich quick position some brothers are falling victims because it shows they also had that confessions in them hmm you see you're fine whatever that someone tells you you bring this manner you bring this money just bring fifty thousand let him turn it down in one month you're going to have

me tell you this there's more to it there's actually a lot more to immorality a lot more to eat that's what the Bible says it should never you [Music] foreign stop do you know what Brother Joseph did possessive you know what he went through well maybe I come do you know what someone need to own a building or friends witchcraft [Music] such time said they are believers who even do witchcraft they're intellectual Believers their intellectual Believers but they have not received what I want to show you here the Yoke of hypocrisy oh my you are very quiet some of you might might I don't say

you know foreign [Music] every day of my life foreign and you will find rest for yourself [Applause] he says thus humidity and Sunday in the ways and see and ask for the Old Paths not the new part he wants you to search for the old Empire this is the old path foreign foreign not these things of if you have received a message and someone said one way again you can receive the Holy Spirit slowly slowly every day you come again let me tell you this old path tells us that when God came down he filled them yeah something happened you cannot have the Holy Ghost without an experience our experience you know God visited me I was under a tree I was in my room I was in charge hallelujah hallelujah we don't receive the Holy Ghost to endorses when you received the Holy Spirit you've absolutely respond rest for yourself now you have to have the desire Angela friend listen to me if you don't have that hunger it is a clear sign that you might be dead while living if you find a man that has no hunger for food yeah for one day two days three not set for a week week that man is on his way to the grace of people try doctors if someone is not eating even if he has no anger they force them food they put tubes for them to have food in there by force foreign [Applause] you're hungry for God it means you are dead receive that hunger foreign [Music] says Lord mukama I want I want more reviews you see when we sing the song I don't even want it to end again sometimes when I sing a song and it says that the song is not about how many songs sister don't sing a song you may come and sing a song and then we just said oh yeah fine and seek his face sometimes I fear sometimes that we have become a very good religion we do things religiously I go to church we need to go higher than that for God the Bible says filled with what with the Holy Spirit I just have two minutes to close but I want us to get to the the point I wanted to bring in Jeremiah here he says Those Old Paths get them if they're in and he shall find rest for your souls here's what the people say we will not walk there also I said Watchmen over you which means the preachers he came to the sound of the trumpet but they said we were not here this thing does not please God when God presents a preaching of the words how are you receiving it mothers both of you were mothers you know what it feels like if your child is not eating um Italian until she's sure sometimes she will tell me if maybe the child is sick especially Elizabeth can you stand up immediately look at how big she has become now friends I am now thinking spiritual things because she was our first baby and she did not she was always fussing she didn't want to eat you know and and so she was becoming so my mother said you see

say oh a good old someone no brother sister come and receive the word to a place where you will have an experience where you will come to church [Music] from your place this message is not to make us religious sometimes we don't talk about this because we think we're in a Believers that's a good joke it goes with cigarettes and pork name these are Yorks but I believe taking a lot of pork is also a yolk this is Pastor where is that in the Bible alcohol it sounds funny but it's the truth oh God help us and break us off of those yolks you see friends I eat pork but I'm not going to go poke joint and begin taking it like no man's business touched by this so much and then you come home um friends let me tell you a Christian ah it's not supposed to be like that you say no no no you're not

to be closer you see we need to be closer to God praise the name of the Lord my time is up but I've not yet um reached this verse it's just two or three verses down let's just read along kindly but they said we will not walk there in also I set Watchmen over you saying okay I think I had done done that then verse 19 I think or 18 therefore here [Applause] I will lay stumbling blocks before these
