[33:49] i love this last
[33:51] now
[33:52] are we
[33:53] the sons of god
[33:56] amen
[33:57] now
[33:58] away the sons of god
[34:01] my sister liz is asking but me and my
[34:03] sister yes you're also among this the
[34:06] man
[34:08] we are the sons of god and it does not
[34:11] yet appear
[34:13] what we shall be
[34:16] but we
[34:18] know
[34:18] we know what we
[34:21] know
[34:22] that when he shall appear
[34:25] we shall be like
[34:27] him amen
[34:29] for we shall see him
[34:31] as he
[34:38] whosoever is born of god
[34:41] does not commit sin
[34:44] for his seed
[34:46] remains in him
[34:50] and he cannot sin
[34:53] because he is born of god god amen may
[34:58] the lord
[35:00] bless the reading of this world
[35:02] you may be silent
[35:06] amen
[35:08] we have read
[35:09] the first verse
[35:11] in the bible when god first created
[35:15] the bible says that when he created
[35:17] everything
[35:19] he commanded it to produce
[35:22] its
[35:23] kind
[35:24] amen
[35:26] and in everything that god created he
[35:30] put a seed
[35:32] and it was that seed oh it is that seed
[35:36] which has the power and the capacity to
[35:40] produce its own yes
[35:44] and even as we are tonight a jackfruit
[35:46] tree is still producing jackfruits
[35:51] a pineapple is still producing pineapple
[35:56] it would be a mystery if you were
[35:59] working in your garden one morning and
[36:02] you find a banana plant
[36:04] bringing casaba my brother you will make
[36:07] the longest love
[36:09] amen it will be so bad so weird you
[36:12] don't even fear it
[36:14] when you meet a banana plant producing
[36:18] cassava
[36:19] why
[36:20] it would have gone against
[36:23] the
[36:24] original command it was given
[36:27] amen
[36:28] how many believe you are the seed of god
[36:32] oh hallelujah
[36:33] you believe it
[36:34] my sister you believe it my brother
[36:38] if you are the seed of god
[36:41] then it means even you you must produce
[36:46] what
[36:47] you must produce of your kind what is
[36:50] your kind if you see you are a seed of
[36:53] god it means they're all so
[36:55] good
[36:57] all right
[36:58] it means you should produce
[37:01] things which pertain to
[37:03] god
[37:04] amen
[37:06] amen we are just getting started we
[37:09] shall get it there
[37:11] now when we
[37:13] went to the first book of john
[37:16] brother john here said
[37:19] that a beloved
[37:21] and the today brother held me
[37:23] by the help of the holy spirit is saying
[37:25] that beloved
[37:27] now
[37:28] we
[37:29] are the sons of god
[37:31] not tomorrow not yesterday not in the
[37:34] future now amen why are we sons of god
[37:38] because in the verse we have read the
[37:41] bible has confirmed that every plant
[37:44] will produce of its
[37:47] kind
[37:49] god produces
[37:50] god
[37:52] a cow produces
[37:55] amen
[37:57] now he says now we are the sons of god
[38:02] and then he saying
[38:06] and it does not yet appear
[38:11] a little bit confused
[38:14] a liar
[38:16] sometimes you do this sometimes you do
[38:19] the other sometimes
[38:21] but he says here
[38:24] it does not yet appear
[38:29] when you look at yourself and you read
[38:32] this verse
[38:33] it does not yet appear
[38:37] isn't it brothership
[38:39] when you look at yourself and the bible
[38:41] says now you're the son of god it does
[38:44] not yet happen but let me tell you what
[38:46] the bible says
[38:51] we but we know
[38:54] when he shall appear yes we shall be
[38:58] like
[39:04] i am just trying we're just going to
[39:06] remind ourselves something very small
[39:09] you know the world right now is shouting
[39:12] too much
[39:14] things are shouting too much
[39:18] politics poverty coronavirus
[39:22] education
[39:24] very many things are shouting
[39:26] that it is very possible
[39:29] to forget
[39:32] the instance
[39:34] the reason
[39:35] the meaning
[39:37] as to why
[39:39] we are living in this place that's right
[39:43] the bible says where he shall appear we
[39:48] shall be like him
[39:51] that is solely solely the reason as to
[39:55] why we're here
[39:58] when adam and eve sinned in the garden
[40:00] of eden and the god chest them out now
[40:03] this is what god did when he had started
[40:06] the garden of eden he had created a home
[40:09] for him and his children that's right
[40:10] but then when it was disturbed and
[40:14] it is not that it came to him by my
[40:16] question no
[40:18] but when things happen what he did the
[40:20] prophet of the state says that he
[40:22] created a loop of time
[40:25] and then this garden of eden
[40:28] he removed it here and then he shifted
[40:32] somewhere where we called the millennium
[40:35] are we together
[40:37] so
[40:38] in the middle here
[40:40] we are just people who are just actually
[40:43] i love these words i'm a pilgrim and
[40:47] that stranger
[40:49] my brother my sister wherever you are
[40:52] whatever you're doing whatsoever is
[40:55] making you cry whatsoever is
[40:57] discouraging you whatsoever is really
[41:00] strangling your life
[41:02] you are a pilgrim and a stranger
[41:05] but in this journey
[41:08] our goal
[41:09] is to be
[41:11] like him in him amen
[41:14] amen
[41:16] why because if we are the seed of god
[41:21] we must produce of our
[41:24] that's true okay amen
[41:26] yes that is why the bible says that even
[41:30] nature now
[41:31] grows
[41:32] why does it groan
[41:35] it was created to bring forth a life
[41:38] it was created to do this it was great
[41:40] to do that but when it looks around oh i
[41:44] am a geographer to challenge me to some
[41:46] geography
[41:48] when the mangoes when the jackfruit when
[41:52] the banana when they look around at what
[41:55] they are supposed to produce it is
[41:58] distorted
[41:59] it is not good man talking it is not
[42:02] good jack food it is not good pineapple
[42:05] why because the world has been polluted
[42:09] that's right
[42:12] there has been a soil election
[42:15] there has been so long exhaustion
[42:18] so
[42:20] bringing forth of the kind
[42:22] it's as if it is becoming a night man
[42:27] you knew down and said lord
[42:30] i shall be like you bad
[42:33] i am still so weak
[42:35] i can't even pray
[42:38] i carry
[42:40] am i speaking to somebody amen
[42:46] that is not my sermon
[42:48] we were just introducing men it is going
[42:51] to be very brief
[42:54] when it shall appear
[42:56] nature is groaning
[42:58] what is making nature groaning it is
[43:01] also making children grow that's right
[43:04] and because of this groaning right now
[43:06] in the world
[43:08] oh
[43:10] nature
[43:11] some nature is forgetting
[43:14] the inspiration
[43:16] the reality the reason as to why you see
[43:19] it
[43:21] when you look here you're groaning when
[43:23] you look here you're groaning when you
[43:25] looking southwest
[43:27] i remember the scripture where the man
[43:30] of the prophet of god went to the valley
[43:32] and it was all full of dry
[43:35] bones
[43:37] oh if this is not a time where life
[43:40] itself
[43:42] has become god
[43:44] amen
[43:45] but we have come to remind ourselves yes
[43:48] sir
[43:49] as things are making us grown in the
[43:52] spirit in the physical as the world is
[43:55] quitting us
[43:57] we should not forget that's right amen
[44:03] hallelujah
[44:04] i'm going to talk about a man called job
[44:08] for if you want to write
[44:10] my heading
[44:12] the expression
[44:14] of god is confidence in the seed
[44:18] amen the expression of god's confidence
[44:23] in the sea
[44:28] when god created these seeds
[44:32] and he told them to produce of their
[44:35] kind
[44:37] he meant it and he finished it amen
[44:40] and god trusts every plant
[44:44] god trusts every seed
[44:47] that it must
[45:00] amen
[45:03] god has confidence
[45:05] in his seed that they will produce that
[45:08] life yes yes
[45:11] when he shall appear we shall be like
[45:14] him but when we look at us when we look
[45:17] at the world when we look at what is
[45:19] making growing we
[45:21] fall down
[45:23] paul said i'm we are beaten down and
[45:26] actually i don't know how he said
[45:28] beaten but not destroyed
[45:30] struck down
[45:35] god has confidence in his sin
[45:39] am i talking to the seed of god in this
[45:41] world
[45:42] if you are a seed of god
[45:45] god has confidence in you amen
[45:48] hallelujah
[45:51] don't be like these people who say if
[45:53] god is god why did he kill
[45:55] satan so that we live on this earth just
[45:59] he did not kill him because he knew that
[46:03] nothing you will bear just fruit

[1:20:24] within the wilderness
[1:20:26] underneath mountains

[1:20:34] is the god of the valley
[1:20:38] when things go wrong
[1:20:42] he will make them
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:20:59] this is where
[1:21:01] the seed
[1:21:03] was moving
[1:21:04] in the mountains
[1:21:07] in the dams
[1:21:10] brotherhood i don't like the elsewhere

[1:21:27] the foreign
[1:21:28] it means they live in this world
[1:21:32] jesus said
[1:21:34] that the priest
[1:21:36] of this world is coming
[1:21:38] he's coming
[1:21:40] but he has
[1:21:42] nothing in me
[1:21:44] amen amen

[1:21:51] he has nothing in
[1:21:52] me
[1:21:55] that's the prince of this world has
[1:21:57] anything in you no is there a yak fruit
[1:22:00] tree starting to bring apart
[1:22:02] [Music]
[1:22:04] oh it is bringing totally nothing
[1:22:06] because if it is bringing totally
[1:22:08] nothing let me give you something news
[1:22:10] the bible says every tree that bear is
[1:22:13] not fruit oh my god
[1:22:18] you must be
[1:22:21] of your kind
[1:22:25] the world is sustaining
[1:22:28] unfortunately the fasting world is
[1:22:31] fasting with you
[1:22:35] oh god
[1:22:49] my brother my sister
[1:22:53] god was not confused
[1:22:56] no
[1:22:57] i think he made a mistake to create in
[1:22:59] this evil age
[1:23:03] now
[1:23:10] the problem is this
[1:23:12] some of you people when you got saved
[1:23:14] when you received this message you
[1:23:16] thought you're going to to sleep for the
[1:23:19] bed of roses
[1:23:23] you're going to eat from silver crackers
[1:23:30] oh yes you will sleep on bed
[1:23:35] you will eat on the silver platters
[1:23:38] but
[1:23:41] sometimes the devil
[1:23:43] tells me
[1:23:47] when jesus was nailed on the cross
[1:23:52] this man came say is this man dead is he
[1:23:55] really dead
[1:23:57] is he dead
[1:23:58] so they came with
[1:24:00] a spear javelin
[1:24:04] let me tell you
[1:24:05] one of these days my sister not a
[1:24:07] prophet
[1:24:08] one of these days my brother
[1:24:11] their pharisees
[1:24:13] they services
[1:24:17] yes the roman officials will come and
[1:24:20] see whether jesus is dead
[1:24:24] they will come and pierce you
[1:24:28] to see are you dead
[1:24:31] oh is the jesus in you alive
[1:24:35] you know this man who played that movie
[1:24:37] played it well
[1:24:38] the water and blood came out
[1:24:41] that's true
[1:24:44] when the devil pierces you to see are
[1:24:46] you dead oh you are living again
[1:24:52] the bible said that when the devil gets
[1:24:54] out of his person it goes and it wanders
[1:24:56] and then it comes back to church
[1:25:02] [Laughter]
[1:25:05] he gave us a testimony
[1:25:08] but you know my brother brother
[1:25:19] praying so much in the spirit all the
[1:25:21] time in the market he's asking for
[1:25:29] [Laughter]
[1:25:36] [Laughter]
