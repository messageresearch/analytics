Esther is not around this morning um and but she sent greetings I think there some issue and also sister Joan she has a paper this morning I know there are some students I don't know why these days um um universities are trying to take sunds also I understand brother Peter only can attend weekdays I think for the rest of this year but on Sundays they usually are at school uh they have papers and

comfortable this is called days of the voice Fellowship where we have no book but the Bible no love but love and we have no Creed but Christ and we believe that the blood of our Lord Jesus Christ cleanses us from all sin of course we have no Fellowship we have no denomination membership but we only have fell amen amen um also I have a cheat here from a brother and I think the message has been passed To Us by Sister Ruth um from uh regarding our husband brother Emma uh brother Emma is one of us the husband to Sister Ruth but you aware he has he doesn't regularly attend Services physically I hope he streams because is a serving um officer and um is usually um at different deployments and so he's in the Air Force and so he has been currently deployed to Somalia and he request for your prayers um he will be there for a one year period so he was supposed to be here but again his daughter Shilo got a bit sick and so I think he's in the hospital but the Lord is good amen the Lord good with you has it been with good with you amen amen I want to when I look at you I want you to smile don't scare me when I look at you and you smile I feel happy musicians I also want to preach while looking at you I see some free chairs so you can and if musicians can always take the front seats I would appreciate I have three there and one there that's good wonderful praise the Lord amen oh these ones want to remain here shall We Stand we would like to just right away go to the I have a meeting with the musicians right after the service amen um I have an announcement which is not yet ready um we we we received communication from Bethany High School that they are going to be marking is going to be marking at their Center Unfortunately they received communication from a bit late and so they will not be able to uh host us for this year for this coming year but also the good news is and for those of you who have not been attending services or even streaming you're hearing this for the first time but I announced this on Friday yes I thought you didn't hear interpret everything you hear not what you understand but what I say thank you so um on um on on Friday I talked about it and um uh the good news is we have a new place and a better place that night I I I was just in prayer and praying for uh the the Youth Camp youth meetings and then I received those news in the morning I said Lord it can't be I was praying God provide provide for the Youth meetings and communicate in the morning oh we no long have the place God is this the way you provide and you know we were having a deficit of 13 million apart from what you have pledged and what we expect the young people to bring when they come so we having a deficit of about 13 million but um so when we go to the new place that God provided it is just right here on road not far from UNS uh you know the they we we are still in these discussions but it is likely that they are going to charge us an overall of 4 Millions for the three days and this place which we we had was requesting for 9 million so it means if we have this place mil God would have given us 5 million so that means it was the hand of provision of the Lord so sometimes you pray a prayer and God answers in a way you never expected but always trust God trust God so let's keep trusting God behind this vision of these youth meetings and we believe that it will be a success the devil is not happy and so he's fighting it but let us also keep fighting the devil and believe in God amen amen let us go to the Book of Romans chapter 11 I I want all the musicians here because I'm having even a meeting with them afterwards and I see one of them there and I have some free chairs right here come and sit with your daughter God bless you brother Peter you know musicians sometimes they play very well and then they go behind there and they begin dozing throughout and afterwards they want to come back and play we want to be sober throughout I'm not saying you do I'm saying sometimes let us go to the Book of Romans chapter 11 ver 29 for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance amen let us pray Lord we have just read one verse out of the book of Romans but there are many things in our heart that we want to today may you inspire us Lord and help us today that whatever will be say will edify your children but we ask this blessing in Jesus you may have your seats please so to you who are coming to dvf the first time I'm saying um feel relaxed here we just love the message we are free and uh just feel at home I spoke on this um the last time I spoke the last time I preached I believe it was on Wednesday but there is a lot on this subject but I feel that we all need to to learn the pattern for every true Ministry I know I preached on this sometime um sometime maybe a year ago so maybe this will be a part three the pattern for every true Ministry so here the scripture tells us and we're just going to get right in I'll not be long this morning I don't plan on being long but how many have a hunger for the word amen we have come that we may be filled so I'm requesting that your heart will be here your mind will be here your spirit will be here like your body is here so avoid moving out unnecessarily um I believe every adult can really sit for the one hour or one hour and a half that without going out I have understood from the Deacon some people just go out to pick phone calls I think that is Unbecoming for a Believer it's a shame actually you know for you to come into the church and then you keep your phone on vibration so that when they call you you go out it's not right it doesn't it means if you do that you are not here 100% but I believe we should be here 100% mind soul Spirit or I should say Body Soul spirit yeah and we should focus on what God is speaking to us and even even now as I speak check your phone if it's not in silence or airplane mode please do put it in Airplane modee uh so that you can focus how many are going to focus ask your neighbor you going to focus are you going to focus okay what did your neighbor say amen I love preaching to a focus congregation because then God does many wonderful things forg and and calling of God are without repentance now I think amen you know God just gives you the gifts and he calls you and you don't need to repent repentance is not a necessity for you to have gifts or to be called by God and because you know this is a very uh important subject many people think because someone has a gift automatically this person is filled with the Holy Spirit someone can actually have a gift and may even not be a believer some someone may speak tongues when he an adter someone may interpret tongues someone may preach when they have never met God and this has been a stumbling block to many Christians because we thought that when someone if someone can serve God it is automatic that they are man or a woman of God but that is not true and that is why today I wanted us to look at the pattern for every true Ministry so that means not all that have a Ministry is a true Ministry there is a true Ministry and a false Ministry but how can we know the true Ministry there is a pattern that we can find in the scripture that if that kind of ministry has that pattern within it then that is a true Ministry and when I talk about a Ministry I mean a minister okay now Ministry is different Ministries you may be a minister but not a preacher but I'm also speaking about preachers I'm speaking about churches I'm speaking about um you know other kind of Ministries as well I'm talking about you know a father it's a Ministry mother it's a Ministry wife is a Ministry husband is a Ministry you know we have other you know Ministries singing Min you know and all these other gifts that we have in our Min they're all ministering musical instruments uh players they all ministers deons and ministers and you know older mothers older men mothers you know Minister supposed to be ministering to the younger women and I spoke about that on on Wednesday um we have Sunday school teachers those are ministers as well some of them are sisters others are brothers and other you know media department and all these departments brother here works on the projector so that you can be able to see the songs so that you can sing where is ministering someone comes to s sweep and clean and he is a minister you're minister so there are many ways to minister so when I am talking about Ministry don't only think about the preaching ministry as much as that is the main so now we will get into the details so now I want us to First deal with Matthew 7 if you can turn with me to your Bibles in the Book of Matthew 7 uh vers 18 amen amen and I know there are some uh brothers from the north of Ethiopia that usually follow our services I send my greetings our greetings to them we are looking at Matthew 7: 18 and I want you to listen a okay can you read with with me brother a good tree bringeth not forth good fruit okay let me read again I was reading verses 19 I'm reading vers 18 a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit um every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is H down and cast Into the [Music] Fire and you know on verses 15 he had told us to be aware of false prophets they come in ship's clothing but inwardly they are ring walls so and he said we shall know them by their fruits and then he begins to explain the tree and he says every tree that brings not good fruit that one is corrup every tree sorry every every so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt one brings evil fruit and he said that good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not this is verse 19 not fourth good fruit is H down and cast Into the Fire wherefor by their fuits you shall know them not everyone that saith unto me now he progresses from speaking about a tree and he begins to talk about people ministers Believers so he's saying they are like a tree and by the way the word tree in the Bible language means person or people that is why in The Book of Psalms chapter 1 verse one it speaks about a man that walks not in the councel of the unod and then he says it shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water so you remember the Genesis was also speaking about a tree the Tree of Life the tree of life is not a physical tree person a man the person of Life the man of life and he came on Earth and he said I am the life that was Jesus he came and declared that he is the life so we know the tree of life is a man then also in the Book of Revelation he says to him that shall overcome I will give him to eat of the tree of life so the Tree of Life can be eaten and Jesus when he was on Earth he said this words he said he that cannot eat my flesh or drink my blood is not worthy of me so you mean you can eat Jesus and drink Jesus they were offended and they moved away but they did understand that he was not meaning physical eating how do you eat from a tree you eat by hearing Jesus said my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed so he meant we should eat his flesh but his flesh is the word and his his blood is the spirit so you see when you eat the word right now all of us we are eating the word now so pull out your FKS brother pull out your spiritual knife pull out the spoons let us begin eating the word amen amen so you should be on your nerves ready there are those who fight for food outside they want big they want to be in front but when we come to church they don't want to be in front you have to be in front you to be on deep to to eat big big pieces Hallelujah I want a big pce hallelujah amen his flesh is meat indeed so as you are hearing you are eating the word and then he fills you with the spirit you drinking hallelujah amen so we realize here that's why also the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil was also a person and we realize who it was it was Satan and eve took took a piece out of it the Bible says she ate the fruit out of it and until today until today we are suffering because of that now the devil is so cunning that even today he is having pictures that he has made the angels of light this is one of the most important summons and I want you to be attentive the devil knows if he comes to you as Satan and he says I am Satan believe me all of you will run away so he can't come to you as SAT but the Bible says and give us the scripture brother that he has made himself the angel of Light Amen in second Corinth 11 14 for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of Light tell your neighbor Satan has transformed an Ang of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers transformed as the Ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works and give us verse 13 it says for such a false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the Apostles of Christ so we realize here child of God listen Satan is not coming as Satan Satan is coming to you as a preacher of the Bible we should fear more than anything is the preachers of the Bible because if you don't have the right discernment you can go to Hell by sitting under a wrong Ministry but the Bible say we shall know them by their works and Jesus in The Book of Matthew he talked about a tree first of all he says be aware of false Propet they come in ship's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves and then he begins talking about a tree you know I love Jesus the way Jesus Tau was so simple but so powerful but it takes Revelation for you to understand one day he looks at his disciples and he asked them a question who do you say I am I the son of man and they began fting they said people say where the first question was what people say that I am and then said people say you you Isaiah you are Jeremiah oh you are one of the prophets you are just a prophet so people understood that Jesus is just a prophet until today the Muslims think Jesus is just a prophet he's just a prophet he's more than a prophet he is the god of the prophets Hallelujah amen and then he said what do you say that I the son of and he answered Peter answered to him he said you Jesus Christ the son of the Living God that meant if he a Son of God it means he is God a son of a God is God a child of a bir is a a child of a snake is a snake what about a Son of God is God are you getting the point amen that's why the Bible says you also are Gods we are Gods tell your neighbor I am a God why because the Bible says beloved now are we the sons of God it does not yet appear how we shall be but when he comes we shall be like we are sons of God and our works our life should show who we are and so we notice he Jesus is a simple teacher and when he spoke those words Jesus told Peter flesh and blood has not revealed this to you but my Father in Heaven has revealed this and even today understand who Jesus is understand the word flesh and blood cannot reveal it to you you have to enter the spirit in the realm of the spirit you understand the supernatural in the real of the spirit you understand the spiritual things when you enter into that real brother you begin Flying high in Revelation in understanding that is why we see sometimes when we are in the church some people get crazy they begin shouting they begin you come on they cannot something is burning up why because they have entered into the real of the spirit brother when we are hearing the word come out of the flesh enter into the realm of the when you enter the spirit then you can see what others are not seeing then you can hear more than what is saying then the word will be open to you and you will begin shouting and you'll begin receiving it amen you will stand up and say that is mine but when you begin dozing I can tell you are in the flesh praise the name of the Lord am I want to be in the SP slap your neighbor and tell them I want to the spirit Oh Glory to God and so Jesus says be aware of false prophets and then he goes to the teaching of the tree again and he says a good tree cannot bear bad fruit but corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit every tree that brings not forth good fruit is H down and cast into the fire but I want you to remember he said you will know them by their fruits and Jesus said Apostle Paul told us from the scripture we read in Corinthians that these are transform themselves into Ministers of righteous so let me announce to you this morning today as I speak to you sat also has preachers standing on the pulit there is a Pulpit this Sunday morning where Satan himself is preaching he's using his ministers sat has ambassadors just like God has ambassadors now we are we are getting confused Pastor you are confusing us Pastor what are you trying to say so should we not come to church no keep coming but mind the church you go to amen and it does not matter what they say they believe because Satan has his ministers everywhere hallelujah amen but how shall we know them oh we are so happy we have Jesus and his word and he has warned us before and he has said to us you shall know them by their amen and now let us now go into the explanation of the fruit not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he oh my God but he that doeth the will of the Father which is in heaven how many remember the service on Friday what was the title the will of God you keep coming to services and when you miss a service go and listen to it because you're missing a lot you can't be the same with someone who is charging every time a preacher came from Zambia and he preached to us on the subject of the will of God the will of God I can't repeat what he preached listen to it but we find out here he says not everyone that says Lord Lord Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom but only he that do do the will of my father so how can you do the will of the father go and listen to Friday service but I will tell you this the will of the father is believing the truth and receiving the Holy Ghost not every preacher has the Holy Ghost not every T speaker has the Holy Ghost not every pianist has the Holy Ghost not every Minister has the Holy Ghost there are many who will Minister who will serve but when they have never been filled with the Holy Ghost they may even believe the message but believing the message does not give you the Holy Ghost it is only the [Music] beginning having the right mental attitude to the word will give you the Holy Ghost buing yourself will give you the Holy Ghost confessing and repenting your sins will give you the Holy Ghost as long as you still desire your s you want to protect your lifestyle you have hidden secrets your heart is not open to God you have not reached to that place God surrender there are some demons you are keeping and other demons you are leaving you can never receive the Holy Ghost you have to accept to expose yourself before God and then God will fill you with the Holy Ghost you have to confess your sins don't hide your sins the Bible says that he that conce his sin cannot Prosper even in this life you will make money and money will disappear even in the spiritual real it will be as if you're tied and then you'll begin saying I'm Bewitched you are bewitching yourself by not confessing your sins by living a the life you are going to bars you are still amen addicted to alcohol listen you can't receive the Holy Ghost you are still flatting with girls you flatting with boys and you are calling yourself a Believer you cannot receive the Holy Ghost you need to decide I am tired of this life I am tired of sin I am tired of straying Lord now I'm coming home when you come home brother when you come home sister God fills you with the Holy Ghost but you have to first make a decision don't deceive yourself you cannot be filled if you've not surrendered everything and if you are not sealed you are not going in the Rapture even if you in a message church if you are not sealed you are being prepared for the tribulation and the tribulation is real and it will be much Fierce to those of you I Brother Martin sent me a clip of a preacher and and he was speaking in a very cunning way and he was telling the people listen to me church if you you miss the rapture if you miss the Rapture now don't panic don't panic but I'll tell you what you should do pack up as much supplies as you can find as much food and as much water because you will need it and find a rock if you have to find a rock find a rock hide there because it's going to be terrible but do everything you have to do don't receive that Mark of the Beast and I was like man is preparing the people for the tribulation but it was a good advice H it was a good advice because the Believers who will miss the Rapture it will be terrible for them that's what they will have to do you can't go receiving the mark of the beast you will have to do all those things cuz you can't buy you can't sell so you have to gather whatever you can and you hide well they're coming they're coming they're coming you can't Fellowship normally there will be churches but it will be the ones that are Distributing the mark of the beast the message churches will not be in existence the message believers who were there medoc and they do not receive the seal they will be hiding and running for their life there is a sad day coming there's a sad day coming there's a sad day coming by you know the song Some of these songs we no longer sing them but a very good song there's a terrible day coming but I don't want that day I'm preparing myself for the Rapture Express amen how about you are you preparing yourself and the Bible says not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter therein but the one that doeth the will of my father the will of the father is the word and the Holy Spirit many will say unto me in that day listen Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in your name have we not cast out devils and iny name have we not done many wonderful works and then I Jesus Will profess going to word has a good word Jesus will come profess to them you know he will profess them he will confess themto them and he will tell them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity my good Lord I want you to follow me closely now I want you to see these people they come to Jesus with some things they were holding they're like well me I'll make it to Heaven well then they have made it to Heaven they have made it there are now before him and this one is with the Miracles he did he has a bag of Miracles how many miracles have you ever made this man has made many there's a bunch of them when he was on Earth he was a miracle worker powerful man of God they used to call call him Papa powerful Papa anointed the most Reverend the prophet of the most high Apostle powerful Prophet pastor rever [Music] has many a bunch of Miracles and he will walk before him and he will tell him father allow me to enter see the bunch of miracles in your name he did this mirac and Jesus will look at him let me see sure it is true Jesus will not deny the miracle he will not refuse the mirac it is true the man did them in the name of Jesus so but he will tell him my friend the truth is I never knew you the problem is not the Miracles the problem is that me and you we never had a relationship amen you had a Rel ship with my gift but you never had a relationship with me I never knew you get out before me go away and another one will come and he will tell him oh in your name I went to the people and I cast out a bunch of demons me I was a very powerful preach I kicked all these demons I I was a I was having a Deliverance Ministry Jesus said let me see you did in my name yes Hallelujah it was in your name I remember this girl she came demon possessed and I simply looked at her and I said in the name of Jesus get out and this demon began sing screaming and went out Jesus I can tell you many testimonies I have a lot of them we even have proof on Earth we are recording our ministry it was called fire Ministry Deliverance Min we delivered many people the blind saw the dead were raised I was a Deliverance preacher Jesus will say it is true that is that is true but you and me we never knew each other I never knew you get out from from I want you to to I want you to First think about that think about that brother sister what is heaven going to be like is heaven going to be filled with miracle workers and signs and is that the basis upon which you see a true Ministry and would say I had many people following me many Souls believe I prophesied in your name I did many wonderful Works Jesus not one time did he those works because listen church as we shall see later where the name of Jesus is called it is powerful his word shall accomplish the Bible says his word cannot return unto him voice it shall accomplish that which it has been sent to whether it is a woman preacher she can cast that demon in the name of Jesus and the demons will obey do you know that the Bible did not say only the men will cast Dem the Bible says all those who believe they can cast out demons so she may be a woman preacher even he may be a man he may be a little boy and they will indeed cast that demon they will have powerful anointed Ministries but that is not the basis for the Rapture they may have been great singers they may have been great people to be anointed women anointed men but listen Church that is not the only basis anyone let me tell you this the word of God has rules if you apply the rule the rule will work amen praise the name of the Lord you see Nature has rules and the rule is what is up comes down it's called a law of gravity why it is up and it's coming down what is happening it's a law which one physician discovered what was his name H Ian Newton Isaac Newton Newton thew gravity we have many University students looking at come on tell me is it Isaac newon I was thought it was Isaac Newton me I was very poor in my in physics Isaac Newton discovered it but it was already there by God he created it the law of gravity now in the Bible there are other laws if you give you receive if you want to be rich you don't become rich by working hard according to the Bible working is right the Bible says You must work if you are L he says you will be poor so you have to work but getting blessed and becoming rich and richer actually does not come by prayer God make me Rich oh God I see myself I'm a milli I attract money by prayer come to me in the name of Jesus and you are praying every day you remain poor we have some of those Brothers I saw one in Ethiopia somewhere always on The Prayer Mountain he does not want to work you give him something to do he refuses I feel I should be in prayer God is going to give me this God is going to do great things money is coming and this brother was a very poor brother money does not come by prayer you see the law is if you plant a seed you will the seed will grow and it will have many other seeds like so what you saw that shall ye also re that is the law of sewing and harvest is that correct Farmers know it very well but Believers don't know it that's why they don't give but if you give the Bible says give and he shall receive overflowing it is the word of God but if you give sparing you will receive sping give bountifully give generously and he shall receive the same that's the right thing we believe we believe in sowing that those kind of seeds if you s kindness you shall reap kindness if you saw you shall receive brother saw the right SE if you s hon you shall reap access praise the name of the Lord amen that is the law of the word but we have another law that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow every tongue shall conf that Jesus is Lord the name of Jesus is the powerful name which is given to us for deliverance of out of demons for salvation of the sick for healing of the sick the name of Jesus is above every name do you believe that a name above every name the Bible did not say if the Believers only they mention the name it is for every man when they use that name it will bring the results so you will find a false prophet using the name of Jesus and it will work I say it will work amen why is he FSE because he's preaching a wrong Doctrine the name of Jesus works but Believers don't even know how to use the And when they see others using it and it is working then they say those ones went under the water no we don't need to go under the water to get power power is in the name of Jesus there is power in the name of Jesus sing with me now there is power in the name of Jesus what does it do Break Every Chain Break Every Chain it breaks Every Chain Break Every Chain Break Every it breaks so you see it's the name how is in the name so they receive the name in casting out demons they receive the name in Deliverance they receive the names in prophesying but when it came to Salvation of their soul they rejected the amen the Bible says in book of Acts there is no other name whereby we can be saved by the name of Jesus and that name is what we should be baptized into in The Book of Mark 16 ver1 15 he says going preach the gospel to every he that believes and is baptized shall be saved in the book of Acts 2:38 it says repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus in the name of Jesus Christ what for the remission of your sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost is the promise if you are planted in in the likeness of his death Romans chapter 6 if you planted in the likeness of his death you shall be in the likeness of his resurrection amen hallelujah amen now that's where the power of the name is that's the power of the name and we Believers of this message we believe in signs and wonders and miracles and all those things plus water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ what they rejected is what will make them not enter there someone may be a bishop I don't care if they were not baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ they have to Humble themselves and go back again in the water and be baptized again praise the name of the Lord amen and then he says your sin shall be forgiven and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so if you have been baptized in that way having repented correctly let me say this also I've seen many people that I have baptized and have received the Holy Spirit immediately and I've also seen many that are baptized and never did so why the answer can only be one repentance is an act done by the individual baptism is an act done by the preacher filling with the Holy Ghost is an act done by God are you following me now if I do my job as a preacher correctly and I bapti you in the name of the Lord Jesus CHR having be repented correctly you you have repented correctly God has to fill you with the but the issue is many people don't repent correctly repentance is not confession repentance is living sin if you have been having a boyfriend you tell from today no more before you are baptized you have to confess that to him tell him I've changed my ways I have decided no more if I've been drinking alcohol you throw it away you from today no more remember you should have the desire for those things but you have made it up your mind and you want God to fill you so the desire can die so you have to repent repentance is turning around if you're going a certain direction you decide to turn around and go another direction that is true repentance amen amen now if you have truly repented you will even be in bitter tears before we even go to the water and those kind of people when I baptize them God comes right away and he baptizes them into the Holy Ghost and many of them speak tongues others don't but they will have a certain gift that will manifest in their life what I'm saying God must fill you with the Holy Ghost if you been baptized correctly having repented correctly are you following me church but many they can repent correctly they can repent correctly and they baptized wrongly so God can feel them others can may not repent correctly and bapti correctly and they will never receive the holy so you see you have a part to play what is your part if you're still living in sin you have not repented you are still a sinner because you have not repented but you have to repent of your sin change your ways make up your mind I will follow Jesus when you make up your mind like that and I baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you must receive the Holy Ghost but these preachers and ministers they were not working in that pattern they rejected the correct baptism in the name of Jesus Christ Grace will make you to repent of your sins he will call you bring it to fear fear and and you make you love God and then when you you've been baptized in water God will come right quick and he will seal you and some of you believers who are who who are baptized already but you have not received the Holy Ghost the area of repentance there is the problem clean up everything in your life and let me tell you God will fill you with the baptism of the Holy Ghost he is Duty bound to do it he promised it amen hallelujah amen now the false Ministry may have the manifestation of the gifts but the wrong Doctrine I want to read for you this quote out of the anointed ones at the end time the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them the desire to save Souls that gives them the power to perform Miracles it listen listen it is the same spirit that falls on the Sinners and the righteous the unjust and the just did you hear that ask your neighbor did you hear that correctly the very same Spirit now you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 244 he said there shall arise false Christ not false Jesus but false Christ a Christ is UN anointed one so he's anointed all right by the right anointing but he is false because there has a false teaching a false Doctrine a false Church system a pattern of the ministry and he says um Anointed with a genuine thing but be false prophets of it FAL teachers of it de when someone is performing miracle just believe in him anyhow that area of teaching what is teaching is if he believes in women preachers you better run for your life say Amen if you believe in he believes in women putting on throws a tight don't waste your time is Among Us the false prophet because the Bible forbid women to put on TR he believes in children INF baptism run for your life bapti Father Son and the Holy Ghost and they refused Jesus Christ and refuse that name in bapm run take off sister take off those are the false prophets the one prom the prophet will tell you what the Bible says true Minister the of the word he will not compromise anywhere he will not compromise but when he begins to compromise let us twist that a little that Wasing the time of the the world also make some Amendment and correction here and there this Bible thou shall not touch it or amend it this is our constitution am I preaching to believers this is our it is ourti tou it brother this is our constitution it's our constitution what it says we say Amen the Bible say the word of God is forever seted in heaven if God said it I believe it that settles it the word of God is not up for debate we cannot debate the word that's why God sent us a prophet brother Bram was not like these false prophets Bram listen listen listen he was a word prophet he never preached anything that is not in the Bible did you know that the message is not a new teaching the enti message is not a new revelation it is the same old teachings of the Apostles that's why we sing give me that give me that oh give me that time religion is good oh my you better sing it like Pentecostal real Pentecostal Now give me that whole time rep oh give me that whole time oh give me that whole time religion is good this religion we have is the old religion the oldest religion on Earth that God to the disciples and that's the work of William Bram brother bham came with a work to restore [Applause] give me an teaching that Tau I will show you the Bible everything he told is in the Bible it is not William Bram that came up with a serpent it was the Bible the apostles Tau it it's not William Bram that refused women to preach Apostle Paul as a matter of fact is the one who T it and hey did you know he wasn't the first old soul he wasn't the first old soul you know that God was the first where in the Book of Genesis we don't know who even wrote that book we believe it was Moses but whoever God revealed it to he said your husband shall rule over you and from that day two things were added a woman will give birth in pain and a man a husband will rule over her therefore she will no longer teach from that day that was instituted even when God was sending prophets he never sent teaching prophetesses the brother was a prophet she was sitting at her house under a tree people would come and she would tell them the word of God she never started a church when she went out what did she do Gideon was you know speaking to the people and leading people to war but de what did she do she L them in a song mam a prophet what did she do she L people in her song praise God when Jesus came he never had a woman among the 12 and when Judas became the devil and he had 11 none of them was a sister oh are you saying God doesn't use women ah I'm not saying that I am saying God uses women but not in a capacity as a Bible teacher to men Bible says a woman is should not accept authority over the man or teach a man but to be in silence first of the two the reason he gives it Genesis issue not the law those people who tell you women are not allowed to preach because of the law no they're wrong no the law found it and the left it so you understand we are Bible Believers we don't we just believe what is given to us we don't we are not theologians we are just Believers amen oh our sisters can serve in many capacities our sisters can sing can they can play the musical instruments they can sing special songs they can prophesy they can give tongues they can interpret times the sisters they can um teach Sunday school we have several here who do those things already you know the sisters have a lot of work the older sisters they teachers also to younger sisters to teach them how to love their husbands how to be keepers at home how to love their children and all those things it's in the book of Titus Chapter one so you see all these things the Bible has clear stated it brother Bram only came to restore these teachings because the denominations had robbed it away with a false Ministry so brother Bram came with one job to restore the teachings of the Bible Hallelujah amen woo my God I wish you people can become crazy like me and Sh like I'm sh let me tell you Church any preacher that rejects the teachings of William Bram he is not a full gospel [Applause] preacher I dare you show me one preacher who rejects William bram's teaching and I will show you a preacher who rejects the Bible they claim they believe William Bram as a prophet the word of God comes to a prophet for them they think they want to accept him only in the prophetic the the manifestations but listen that is where they go wrong the manifestations can even be fed the ultimate sign that someone is a true Prophet that will teach the Bible in its entirety praise the name of the Lord now Saints I want to try and um I'm I'm just getting started really because I was going to show you the threefold quality I just maybe the threefold quality of a true Ministry what is the three quality of a true Ministry number one Paul was absolutely true to the world he never deviated from it no matter what no matter what the cost Paul was willing to pay the cost to stay with the word and that's what I've been emphasizing since I started notice that Paul was unorganized notice Paul was unorganized Paul was unorganized was not organized but Spirit Led as when God moved upon Moses to lead Israel out [Applause] of now you have to understand the power of these words now I'm quoting the church age book and I want you to follow me closely now Paul was an organized he was Spirit L every man of God every Minister every ministry will be Spirit L even our Sunday school teachers we have sisters here who have been ministering to Sunday school we don't give them a curriculum sister go and preach this no they are Spirit Le God speaks to them and they go into the scripture they take the word and they bring it to the children and they preach it to them why they are Spirit Le every Minister every Pastor must be Spirit Le the musicians must be the deacons the mothers when was the last time you knel down and prayed for your children and prayed for Lord to give you INSP and guidance how to make your home you must be Spirit Le We Are Holy Ghost Le people you as a woman you go cook food for your husband you pray over it you pray for him you as a man you pray for your home you lead your children by example praise God Amen but if you you have a lot of problems and that's when you remember to kneel down and pray your child will come and Daddy are you okay are you fine because he doesn't know that you pray but when you pray every day your child will just come and join you because he knows it's time to pray now listen Jerusalem's Council never sent Paul out nor did it have any power or jurisdiction over him Hallelujah amen Paul was led by the Holy Spirit the C of Jerusalem was not the one that sent him out God and God Alone he did the sending and the leading Paul was not of men but of God he was not of men but of God you see denominations they send a man somewhere you see when you are somewhere in a place where there is no Fellowship where there is no Fellowship you know God can speak to you start evangelizing you don't need to wait for a letter from the church the church does not send a preacher we always see people coming up to minister let me tell you a little bit of how we make preachers or we encourage preachers are you hearing me amen there is no man who can make another one a preacher no it doesn't happen number one number two a preacher is called by God and gifted now a gift will open way for him the scripture says here a man's gift maketh room for him Proverbs 18:16 a man's gift maketh room for him and bringeth him before great you remember how David started singing and playing for how many remember that he was A Gifted Man so whenever he would play s would enter the spirit would leave him so he hired him you'll be here to play for me all the time it wasn't a councel that sanctioned David it was a gift you find people fighting and fasting they want to be the ones to minister they want to God never allow that in Dev it's a wrong Spirit a gift should make room for you who gives you the gift God Almighty and then when you stand up to minister people will oh I'm blessed oh I'm blessed I was going through this situation but something you will see that brother coming back again to me maybe in the cell group somewhere but where someone stands up and ministers and people begin crying that brother he really hurt me there's a problem there's no gift in there there's no Ministry in there and on one is I'm continuing with this but you will see the three uh uh um you know patterns three qualities and and in a nutshell I'll tell you this man must be true to the word this ministry must be true to the word secondly that Ministry will be in the power of the spirit thereby demonstrating the spoken word of God and the written word of God it will be demonstrating not just talking about but demonstrating praise the name of the Lord amen and and lastly that Ministry will bear FR will bear fruit there has to be fruit otherwise if you have no fruit someone saying God sent me to preach in when you go he has immorality with the people he came to there is one person there two people here and they also living in [Music] sin and this person has been there for 5 years saying God sent me there did God send them no there is no fruit there must be fruit you must bear fruit in your ministry I see your concentration has come down so I I wouldn't want to continue after here because this is a teaching that I must teach you when you're very sober and I'm one person who doesn't believe in I have to preach everything I wanted to preach no to preach you

University so always remember me in prayers I'm taking a few students there can say about 10 of them coming consistently so I want you to remember that in prayer for the Lord to reveal to them the mystery of this message and also you pray for sister PE uh who is really doing good mobilization there a student there so pray for her that God will also continue to establish her because if he does then she becomes a good Ambassador there also pray for brother nille he's also at the same school I think sister you're doing is it a business course and he's doing a law course so but they're both there I think about two other students from little so they usually come and be part of that Fellowship let's pray for that fellowship at Ting that great things will come out also on Thursdays I'm always at in in there with brother and at first it was like a home sale then last this this week it was like a crusade so someone came up with an idea I don't know who came why do we hide ourselves here we could even go that's a good idea and uh so this week speakers disturbed us and power went off but we are believing we are going to get good loud speakers yes that area so we we are going to seriously evangelize them with this message which we have rece amen I believe each of you should be on fire to evangelize every Sunday come with someone don't come alone it is a shame people the pcal they their friends they like at least three or five you are confident you come alone it is a shame it is a big shame you to come to church your neighbor someone go to the streets and buyways the to the many of you say to every brother there is amen that should be our custom every Sunday think who will I take to never know what God will use some of my friends when I was going in school believe this message and some of them are even preaching it now so especially to you young people bring your friends to amen amen and sister gud and um and I don't know who else they usually also sister Angela they've been coming to that so also the where you live there's a cell there find out there's a sister brother Marin has been ministering there good Tes good testimonies um new people are coming to hear the message um and brother Marin God is using him in a special way getting good testimonies um I think you meet there everyone every Monday yes um then in brother Martin's Place there is aell there the Believers who go around there please go my home here on Friday brother shalom is the one taking care of that cell and I did not know he's a preacher he preached to us the first time he spoke about prayer I want I don't know if it is possible if they do it can you preach that sermon again it would be good the whole church I was inspired so much and it changed me there's a lot of of young people brother Dan is preaching at at another brother's place there and yeah I think I've forgotten a few but there sales everywhere find where you belong and participate in those Services every week those should not hold if there is no New Soul so in your C you brothers who are ministering there's no new soul I don't know I don't know what you're doing you see the soul encourage people to bring new Souls did a good thing he put it up he said let everybody here in my area every Thursday we preach about how many do you think this message is this gospel the Bible was talking about it should be preached every year must hear it this is the generation that God is going to come back again andure his church if we really believe it we should do evangelism if you really believe it you yourself should do evangelism we are not just here to start another church denomination we here to tell our generation that the Rapture is about to happen so God bless you Saints have a wonderful week and to our land F please do as much as you can and um also they ctions for the pledges for the Youth Camp where brother again back there and also brother Jo is back there don't wait for the people to come to you if you see someone never pled call them team leaders you are beginning to sleep for the sometimes new people come and you don't even approach them approach them encourage them but let them know what we are doing first brother Jo these days you are no longer informing the people what we are doing you just the numbers you have to resume informing the people what we doing because every Sunday we have new people who don't know seven groups we have our [Music] vision and so uh you team leaders when you are approaching a new person tell them our vision first let them have the burden to join your group and support of course we are going to have people who will come and say oh you just minding money those will always be there one thing I noticed friends if you do is and inspired by God going to bring fruits you will have criticism you will have it so if you don't if you want to fear criticism do nothing but whatever we are doing should be sure the Lord is behind it he will bless it
