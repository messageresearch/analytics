Amina and where we are prayed Apostle Paul is telling us he says that being confident of this better thing the direction to Chino amen I mean that he which has begun a good work in you will perform it foreign but as long as there is something good in us that's what God will keep until that is the name of the Lord we are talking of of our faith we have the FED 29 to go where each one of us is going to end blessed with the name of the Lord but I'm glad to tell you that somebody prepared our faith One Way attack from the beginning [Music] there are no forces because your faith is in the hands of the Lord Jesus Christ blessed with the name of the Lord you cannot change your faith to someone I choose because your do you believe that church amen I mean we cannot change our faith say to somebody because only God and God Alone blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen and the Bible tells us in Romans that therefore that therefore God being okay let us read Romans chapter 8. read is okay let me read amen and amen [Music] there is something that I want from this scripture [Music] praise the Lord come here that's the way amen Amina this is very interesting uh chapter therefore now there are for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who worked not out of the flesh but after the spirit [Music] Amina now if you if you come to verses 18. amen we are going to read 18 and then we shall jump and read 28. for every conduct the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US a for the honest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of God is amen Amina and out an essay that and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the call according to his purpose [Music] for whom it did before no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son is that he might be the firstborn among many brethrens moreover whom he did predestinate then he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified [Music] what shall we then say to these things if God before us who can be against us blessed with the name of the Lord there are people whom God for our soul he predestinated them he worked on their issues those are the people whom the Bible says who shall separate us from the love of God which is in Christ blessed be the name of the Lord the word for knowledge is predestination looks back to foreign knowledge foreign foreign but just wake up one morning one night when the sky is clear and see them stars but God says he knows each one of them so God knows everything about you blessed be the name of the Lord but God not making God set in order a little Hall that you have to go through and nobody else can go that way amen I mean God finished before we started yes sir blessed be the name of the Lord so our friends see [Applause] [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord but we are on our way to heaven we have no right to fail here we have no right to keep up from here we are a journey and whatever we are going through God foreign [Applause] again that is not our God [Applause] told me foreign [Music] the hell was not married for us look at him in his eyes and tell him hell was made for you yeah I think if we if they could put us in Hell the fires will be quenched it will stop burning yes sir what you did blessed be the name of the Lord but when the devil is cast in hell so I'm here to tell you this is talking about focusing uh removing our eyes from control the wind together amen I mean and today still I'm reminding you and me that our faith is much much greater than our setbacks many times we go through things God this is just too much my brother's sister it was quite a tough year on myself got an accident knocked somebody the lady got fractures at that moment there was no money Bill was in millions blessed be the name of the Lord amen the message go tell my disciples it says I think of this great prophet job when he sat there at that time and he knew he was growing he spoke the great summon there yeah the one we get from job 14. how he watched flowers how they die and rose again tears down yet it lives again blessed be the name of the Lord that's why it's better to be sealed because Jesus said yes when the Holy Ghost will come remind us of these promises when you are going in trouble I love the spirit of Christ in you he will remind you of this promises amen he was smitten with wounds and yet it was the righteous man he was a just man amen Amina and job was very stranded foreign and God was just there God was there listening and the prophet says many times when God seems to be silent God is there he is listening he says God we want to try you the Holy Ghost want to see what you will do blessed with the name of the Lord one evening when they were sailing on the sea um because they had left Jesus with a congregation yes yes praise the Lord amen foreign [Music] he is the one who copies and even writes the name on his paper amen I mean they give him a paper and they also give you when he sees your answers before him he would have finished writing his name the second name is that is the second name the money the first name the second name is lasting now when he looks at your paper could you call Jesus Is My Savior there is yes and then he tells the invigilator I've made a mistake give me another paper away Jesus is forgetting that in him he cannot believe because he's the father of a lion he's a doctor from the beginning foreign [Music] foreign foreign and it really see these are angels blessed with the name of it amen but here man come putting on suits just like amen but Jesus sitting in that table yes and Jesus says yes they teach them to all the doctrines of men tradition of man he refer the verse Jesus painted Graves yet it's full of maggots blessed be the name of the Lord when they hear the gospel that's why when you add the gospel maybe we're with your friends amen Amina you try to ignore him blessed with the name of the Lord my friend brother Frank when they heard the word he was with his friends and one of his friends it was really is good but some friends the first time I met them I thought they were twins foreign [Applause] when it's doing something maybe the way he moves his hands as if they are remote controlled they do the same thing at the same time blessed in the name of the Lord when the other one is talking you may think it is this one and we are not the twins we can get so close to Jesus if man can get so addicted to his friends how about Jesus foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord amen Nina so no matter what happens around us those setbacks they are nothing the sickness you're going through I'm here to tell you this morning it is not even part of you um the sandbox of habits you are struggling with this you're battling with that until you reach a point I think maybe you're not safe amen we are served by faith as long as you are still confessing Jesus Christ blessed with the name of the Lord amen amen when job was done he said back amen then he was striked by Revelation he looked at a plan like this one the flower the flower becomes yellow it fell down another one comes amen Amina I believe that today maybe job might have shouted I even forgot about his disease you say that all along amen have I been in a situation and you're kind of expecting something to happen but you don't you are not sure what exactly is going to happen and when it happens it may be good or bad Jesus when job was going through his suffering yeah amen blessed be the name of the Lord I'm not concerned about tomorrow neither yesterday is none of your business it's none of your business your concern is today amen the prophet says the devil always refer to us things which are passed and things which are going to be married amen but I'm here today to uh to differ from him that your constant is supposed to be about today amen forget about tomorrow forget about yesterday what failed yesterday what you've been battling with it for years how about this amen and this morning will send you this message blessed with the name of the Lord therefore God being positioned before the foundation of the world uh knew that we would be saved and who would not yeah sometimes we battle with the people [Music] this boy doesn't want to get saved movies [Music] [Music] because you don't know what kind of seed you are dealing with him hmm it is like preaching to pharaohs after God had in his heart what did you expect to receive from him God told Moses for your sake God can destroy the holy nation God can finish the holy Village amen for his child is God can do anything Amina blessed be the name of the Lord sometimes people rise against you just when you're innocent and they fight against you but they just watch them I remember when I got uh when I got an accident there's a man who was on my neck he came to the hospital we are taking the patience happens to pick the second number please that was the behind one so they found him struggling with it then they ask him what are you doing I see this guy's uh this man has knocked something and they asked him where is your point of concerned the patients then where's your problem and then it was called and he was asked how I took the number place that was not answering the questions but for me in there I had no time to fight with him I had people who could help me with him but if we can fight our battles God does not fight for us so I Shield I rested my case even when I came to the traffic office at the scene he came without with uh license I don't need to move to prove to him that I have a license at least I made it in my soul that I will never drive somebody's car without having a license [Music] [Music] Egypt upside down because of his children among all the eggs I believe even in Birds it was indeed it was quite expensive every day they call you you better go without you you rather go without food but satisfying them blessed with the name of the Lord those were set back but my faith is still great few months down the road one morning I was going walk then there is foreign amen man he even told somebody hey that man one day almost knocked me I've never even met him on the road so I knew this is the devil but I said God I will not fight my battles but when time for paying back him it was so bad he bought a car yeah he's a driver he's driving someone who works with the u.nz so he thought that that when a goat sleeps in a crowd it becomes a cough he thought is his yes it is the masses of the Lord Brethren God even take care of us then one day was going to travel and uh oh okay yeah they're traveling they are rich somewhere but when he came out of the bus he realized the bus was running with only one screw again that is the grace of God blessed in the name of the Lord told me why you paid for man about the prayers got an accident and he told me I don't know whether three or four people died or whatever so that's why when you're dealing with the children of God you need to be careful again there is together [Music] addressing the solution yeah Hallelujah I wish you could do grasp with that amen amen God knows you will be attacked by 1 000 demons he knows the summer he looks strong that may put you down but that will not be the end of you that's why there is this scripture it's just not my enemy foreign [Applause] and you want to entertain those who who have come to be entertained because this fight is between the mighty warrior Jesus and the Ghetto Boys foreign [Music] foreign amen man that is where God puts the devil that situation is not winning amen may look hard right now but I'm telling we are going to acquire our church please God is for the foundation of the world when we are going to make it blessed with the name of the Lord amen that is what the devil does not know when he says he doesn't know your next move the devil does not know what you think who knows unless if the thought is of the Devils but they understand what I'm going to do the next day he does not know that I was going to move my foot in front blessed with the name of the Lord when Jesus was here yesterday when the devil was tempting him started he told him if you're a Son of God Jesus was the son of God yes all the same way all the scriptures were showing them but this guy was not sure sit down blessed in the name of the Lord know you are next to move sisters [Music] he does not know that you have forgives blessed with the name of the Lord hallelujah my bed is great turn my setbacks I may be hustling today a lot of Peace [Music] yes sir wow amen amen is a portion of what God has in store for you and to Korea what God has in store for you is you afraid Amina amen I mean as I said before as long as there is something good in you because he said he will keep that thing I am persuaded amen he is persuaded but what he has given him he will keep it until that is that even when he reached his death Point brother Paul never give up he never gave up taiwanika they use the how they call it yeah I don't know where it's what we call for forgotten Timbers kind of way yes but even when they brought that many amen Amina yes you are on the right one even when they brought that this man in your way where is your string where is your faith is what God has for you in store yes sir and that is Victory when we talk about healing talk about Rapture amen amen and you must reach there oh thank God brother sister you will receive the holy ghosts are receiving but foreign foreign you know our horses are tempted you can tame them and they understand they all they they do understand you can communicate with it so this man he looked back and then the dog was the horse was just looking at it says that was tail it was like he was telling him [Music] [Applause] [Music] why yeah foreign each one of us will receive the holy ghosts from receiving the Holy Spirit whatever God has instructors so the devil cannot stop you that is amen you are going through those setbacks we are swimming in this world we are pushing the world behind us how to swim you swim like this amen because you're not going backwards foreign [Music] [Music] foreign because I am giving away who gave him you said because I I stole but because the religious is he was he was amen Satan messed with him Jesus was there yes Amen brother yes yes give me the proof John chapter 1 verses one in the beginning the world was with God and the word who was with Adam in the beginning and the Bible says Jesus was working in it yes we are not okay I'm not bowing down to the devil he will say that it was given to him okay Jesus said Okay if that is the case oh my goodness blessed in the name of the Lord something has just striked me one which intermediate the devil told Jesus it was given to him because we are the setbacks Jesus knows where the end of the story was you don't know what I'm bringing to you amen we are coming in the battle amen man we are coming for rematch God you put him down but man I'm coming the train I'm coming now oh blessed in the name of it but therefore God is he got his March every skills he was bringing it was just dodging amen Amina to make him think that he's winning the name of the Lord he was in the desert he's the one who created the desert quiet foreign issue Jesus was telling the devil yes this is not all about my Hunger this is Jesus saw Redemption sit yes was about to pray when the when the magic came to him I told him [Music] Jesus say that now today I have to I have to mix I have to remove the sugar coating yes because of eating we should n't be my wife it is a drought time yes Jesus Will manufacture food and that's why some ministers come to Jesus everything is going to be okay it's going to give your husband who is going to give you a man who who own a boat again everything is going to be okay we're a little bit different indeed Jesus will give you our husband is a Pilots always a driver but that is just part of the package that's not the main thing then Jesus changed he pulled that he makes that day he mixed very well that the injection was well mixed then he told them unless you eat my flesh my wife have you had that I don't know I don't know I don't know it was not clear ly just unless you eat my flesh My Flesh okay they even forgot the bread yesterday which Jesus made amen Amina but Jesus was driving them to something so many times whatever brings bread before using ministers not Jesus Jesus because he wanted to eat blessed with the name of the Lord and when it comes your way from somebody's broken or maybe the man pulls out the hanky Academy you have not eaten for two days amen when the devil shows you that tell him come on my way to Glory I'm looking at the rupture you have dropped your money Montana [Music] [Applause] do you see where your bats live you will never find a tree on the lights go to the dungeons yeah blessed with the name of the Lord he makes his plans to the under the dungeons God makes his plan up and one day the king of uh the enemy of Israel planning to attack Israeli and they are making their plans and Elijah was enjoying Elijah was enjoying the vision oh God may God lived us somewhere you are going to see what your enemies are planning unless they'll be the name of the Lord where that lady will come where you are selling your stuffs I wanted to keep this money and then you will look there you will look into our eyes you go to this money from which doctor say this and this before you finish that's where God would want to put it the Bible tells us God goes ahead of us amen every time we are moving God went ahead of us all the plants of the devil yes sir maybe you're thriving they want to finish because Jesus is in that question let us read here [Music] he says verses 38 of Romans 8 38. you must be persuaded whosoever comes to God believes that he is [Music] presence things to come weapons five Lords whether to seek the Lords seven Lords three Lord four Lord five Lord six Lord I mean the doctrine looks how the Buddha guy who brought me this morning and he was preaching to me and I was preaching to him Jesus Christ Jesus Christ everything you see our apostles foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] Christ Jesus our lord amen Amina Abraham had hindrances when God gave him the promise he never gave up the Bible says Abraham believed the gods amen he was mocked those were hindrances foreign Hallelujah blessed with the name of the Lord so that was by foreign amen Mina does it mean that we're going to just live carelessly because God foreign everybody [Music] blessed be the name of the Lord God has prepared us a place amen Amina you are not something because you desire to be something you are not something because you desire to be something you are something you are what you are by the will of God see God has set in the church see God God has said in the church don't get in flesh it will never work out abide where God puts you foreign knowledge of God God he did not just set uh in uh okay ironical rule that you would you would or you wouldn't but by his foreign knowledge he uh let him be able to predestinate by the foreign knowledge oh what is amen and as I'm finishing he said the predestination looks back to foreign they were not predestinated to eat so if God put us nearly to believe this message God will pave you away until you reach yourself amen hallelujah no matter what comes our way no matter how the devil fights we are going to make it together not by our own strengths [Applause] by the grace of God's new eyes shall we stand on our feet before the foundation of the world amen before the foundation of the world news how many times you will sleep amen man so let us fight until the end blessed
