[34:02] who are here
[34:03] god bless you i just want to take a
[34:06] moment this evening
[34:07] and deal with the uh i want to deal with
[34:11] a few questions that were brought in
[34:14] uh from the bible study that we had
[34:17] on on tuesday
[34:20] uh i see that since the sisters are not
[34:23] here
[34:23] the sister stop is they are not here
[34:27] but i hope that they will be able either
[34:30] to stream this or to watch this later
[34:32] because some of these questions were
[34:34] from some of them
[34:36] uh i believe that the holy spirit will
[34:38] be able to take and direct these
[34:40] questions to the hearts of those that
[34:41] need it
[34:42] praise the name of the lord certainly i
[34:45] mean the answers to these questions
[34:47] now i've had i'll just go straight to
[34:50] this
[34:50] because uh i wanted to cover like at
[34:53] least two
[34:54] or two or three uh
[34:59] on tuesday one question was asked did
[35:02] john write everything in the book of
[35:03] revelation and we answered that
[35:05] then the other one is god eternal
[35:07] actually that was speaking with the
[35:08] godhead
[35:09] we also handled that then there is
[35:12] another question that
[35:13] that came up as well and
[35:17] this one says why does
[35:20] the devil hate genesis and revelation
[35:22] did we deal with that
[35:25] did we did we oh yeah we didn't why does
[35:28] the devil hate genesis
[35:32] and revelation okay now
[35:35] i'm going to begin with this and then
[35:38] i'll not dwell on this match
[35:39] but to those of you at home uh even
[35:42] those who are here i'm expecting that
[35:44] at least you should have a pen and paper
[35:45] where you can scribble down something
[35:47] with scripture
[35:48] that's something i might say and you
[35:49] want to uh to build on it later
[35:52] so that you can be able to study on it
[35:54] later it's always very important when
[35:56] you come for a service
[35:58] or for uh you know a session in the
[36:01] world
[36:01] to always have a parent paper by the way
[36:03] it's always very important
[36:05] so that you can always uh be able to
[36:08] follow very well
[36:09] now uh i want us to read genesis chapter
[36:13] 2
[36:14] verse 17.
[36:21] if you wish to stand that's okay since
[36:25] since my uh gadget is down i'll remain
[36:28] seated so that you can be able to see me
[36:31] uh it says but of the fruit
[36:34] but of the tree of knowledge of good and
[36:36] evil
[36:37] thou shalt not eat of it for in the day
[36:41] that thou it is thereof
[36:43] thou shalt surely die
[36:46] amen praise the name of the lord
[36:52] now i will begin with this this evening
[36:54] as uh
[36:55] you take your seats and uh it says but
[36:57] of the tree
[36:58] of the knowledge of good and evil thou
[37:01] shalt not eat of it for in the day that
[37:04] thou eatest
[37:04] thereof thou shall surely
[37:08] die and the question was why does the
[37:12] devil hate genesis
[37:13] and revelation and of course in the
[37:16] message the revelation of jesus christ
[37:19] which is part of the church edge book
[37:22] i want to presume that most of you have
[37:24] already read that part
[37:27] i'm going to read the quote but the
[37:29] banham says have you ever noticed
[37:31] how saturn hates two books of the bible
[37:33] more than all others
[37:35] through liberal theologians and
[37:39] pseudo-scientists
[37:40] he is always attacking the book of
[37:42] genesis he's always attacking the book
[37:44] of genesis
[37:46] and the book of revelation in both of
[37:49] these books
[37:50] he says we find saturn his origin
[37:54] his awful ways and his destruction
[37:59] that is why he attacks them he has to be
[38:02] exposed
[38:03] and in those books he is exposed
[38:06] for exactly what he is
[38:10] in those books he is exposed
[38:13] for exactly what
[38:17] he is praise the name of the lord
[38:20] now i want you to to to look at this he
[38:24] says
[38:24] have you ever noticed how certain he
[38:25] hates two books in the in the bible more
[38:27] than all the others
[38:28] now that is not to me that all the other
[38:30] books are not inspired
[38:32] okay of course we have different bibles
[38:35] in the world today
[38:36] let me begin by talking about the bible
[38:38] we have different
[38:40] bibles in the world and when i say
[38:42] different bibles i mean
[38:43] both the versions
[38:47] as well as the types
[38:51] the major two different bibles one is
[38:54] the book the bible of six
[38:56] six books and another is the one of the
[38:58] 81 books
[39:00] maybe some of you did not even know that
[39:02] the bible of 81 books exists
[39:05] but the bible of the 81 books is the
[39:09] what we would call here in uganda the
[39:11] catholic bible
[39:13] or in the theater they would call it the
[39:14] orthodox bible
[39:16] and this is what they consider to be the
[39:19] true bible
[39:20] according to them but you see god
[39:23] by inspiration he was able to lead men
[39:27] during the time of the reformation of
[39:29] the church
[39:30] and inspired them for them to be able to
[39:33] know
[39:34] what is scripture and what was not
[39:37] inspired
[39:38] and just like he inspired men to write
[39:41] most of these books
[39:42] he would certainly inspire men to know
[39:44] which version or which
[39:46] scripture is inspired you understand
[39:48] what i'm talking about
[39:49] so now this they canonized this bible
[39:52] this
[39:53] the 66 book bible which we have
[39:56] which we read from and
[39:59] it too many they call it the protestant
[40:01] bible
[40:03] but it is a bible with six to six books
[40:05] and today we are not talking about that
[40:06] but
[40:07] what i wanted to say is that there are
[40:09] many proofs infallible proofs
[40:12] that prove that this 66 book bible is
[40:15] the authentic bible
[40:17] but also the 66 book bible
[40:21] the devil has also gone ahead to
[40:23] infiltrate it
[40:25] how has he done that the devil has tried
[40:28] to infiltrate
[40:29] the 66 book bible by
[40:32] causing it to be uh
[40:36] watered down and
[40:39] this bible has been watered down through
[40:41] the edges
[40:43] you know by the many different versions
[40:45] that the men have been making
[40:47] you know we have very many versions
[40:49] today the other day
[40:51] with you isaac we were trying to go
[40:53] through
[40:54] uh the differences between niv and kjv
[40:57] and i should say before i even continue
[40:59] to write bible that we would consider to
[41:01] be the right bible
[41:02] and would recommend for you to be able
[41:04] to read is the kjv
[41:06] king james version why
[41:09] because the kjv is the oldest
[41:12] 66 book bible that we know of and
[41:16] and also it is more clear
[41:20] than any other bible it's uh
[41:23] well they say it has the old elizabethan
[41:26] english
[41:27] of the thy the thou thee and things like
[41:31] that and so many people
[41:33] they say well it is hard to read it is
[41:35] hard to understand
[41:36] but what i want to tell you is it is not
[41:38] hard to read and it is not hard to
[41:40] understand
[41:41] as long as you give your heart to
[41:43] understanding it into reading it
[41:45] now what is more easier for you to under
[41:48] to try to read and see what it means
[41:51] or for you to take the watered-down
[41:52] versions and see the scriptures
[41:55] that are not even in the bible that some
[41:57] of them that are in the bible they are
[41:58] taken out
[41:59] and some of them that are not in the
[42:00] bible they are added in
[42:02] so as the children of god we must be
[42:05] able to know
[42:06] that the only right versions that we
[42:09] should read
[42:10] are those versions such as would agree
[42:13] with the major principles of scripture
[42:16] now if you have the niv
[42:17] or if you have one of those versions uh
[42:19] you can just i can give you one simple
[42:21] example
[42:22] and the other day we found very many
[42:24] certainly there are very many you can
[42:25] google it on the internet you'll find
[42:26] there are many differences between the
[42:28] kjv and many versions
[42:30] now these versions most of them are done
[42:32] by the denomination of people the
[42:34] theologians
[42:35] who try to disagree with many of the
[42:37] bible
[42:38] teachings and they try to incorporate
[42:40] their bible teachings into
[42:42] their theological teachings into the
[42:44] bible and many people are taken
[42:46] they're gullible and they're taken over
[42:47] they're overtaken by such a
[42:50] different versions that are not right
[42:52] now
[42:53] i wanted to look at one of them and that
[42:55] one of the verses that
[42:56] you can look at is a 1st john chapter 5
[43:01] verse 7 first john chapter 5
[43:04] verse 7. do you have another version
[43:07] does anyone have another version which
[43:08] is not kjv here
[43:11] any other version here in this house
[43:14] we had another version the other day do
[43:16] you have which version do you have
[43:20] huh someone has taken it
[43:24] can you please try to stop any movement
[43:26] around this area
[43:28] now uh let me ask to those of you who
[43:31] are online
[43:32] how many have a bible that is not kjv
[43:35] please raise up your hand so i can allow
[43:36] you to read for me this verse
[43:40] do you have a version of the bible that
[43:41] is not kjv
[43:46] no no okay okay no one has
[43:49] okay now maybe you can try to do that on
[43:52] your phone
[43:53] someone who has
[43:56] this bible on their phone
[43:59] just try to search first john
[44:06] 5 seven
[44:13] first john 5 7.
[44:23] first john 5 7
[44:29] okay now i have first john
[44:32] 5 7 and i have it in both of the
[44:35] many versions here on my phone and i'm
[44:38] going to try
[44:39] and read it for you first in the kjv
[44:42] okay
[44:42] all right can you give it to me quickly
[44:44] first john 5
[44:45] 7 says do you have it can you read it
[44:48] for us
[44:53] for there are three that bear record in
[44:55] heaven the father
[44:57] the father the one the word
[45:00] and the holy ghost and these three and
[45:03] these three
[45:04] are one now that is we are waiting for
[45:05] you brother please that that is a
[45:08] first john first john 5
[45:11] 7. can you please help us brother you
[45:14] can sit there
[45:14] and try to do this first john
[45:18] 5 7. okay
[45:21] you have to try and be fast so that you
[45:23] can be able to uh
[45:25] be a blessing to the people that are
[45:26] streaming because if
[45:28] it's quite slow it doesn't help much
[45:30] okay
[45:31] now we have uh the verse there it says
[45:34] for there are three
[45:36] that bear record in heaven the father
[45:39] the word and the holy ghost and these
[45:41] three are one can you give us verse
[45:44] eight and there are three
[45:46] that bear record on earth
[45:49] in earth bear witness in earth the
[45:51] spirit
[45:52] and the water and the blood and these
[45:54] three agree in one
[45:56] now can you give us both those verses
[45:58] seven and eight
[46:00] now verse seven the difference between
[46:03] verse seven
[46:04] and verse eight is that verse seven says
[46:08] that uh i need both of them on the
[46:10] screen at the same time
[46:13] so that we can be able to uh
[46:16] we can be able to compare
[46:19] verse seven is saying that there are
[46:22] three that bear
[46:23] witness rather record in heaven okay
[46:26] the ones in verse seven are in heaven
[46:29] and the ones
[46:30] in verse eight are on earth
[46:33] and then it says the ones in heaven they
[46:36] are one
[46:37] father son and holy spirit are
[46:40] one you you know you can't have the
[46:43] father without having the son
[46:45] and you can't have the son without
[46:46] having the holy ghost because these are
[46:48] one it's the same person
[46:50] but on verse eight it says that these
[46:52] three agree
[46:54] in one can you highlight that please
[46:56] these three agree
[46:57] in one now why does the bible say these
[47:00] three agree in one
[47:01] because they agree in one
[47:05] because they are not the same thing the
[47:08] the spirit
[47:09] and the water and the blood each of them
[47:12] are
[47:12] different a distinct and therefore
[47:14] that's why the bible says
[47:16] these three agree in one why because
[47:19] they are distinct they are different
[47:21] are you getting the idea here do you
[47:24] understand what i'm talking about
[47:25] those of you who are online you
[47:27] understand what i'm talking about
[47:28] it says that these three agree in one so
[47:31] now verse eight
[47:33] is talking about the word the spirit
[47:36] the water and the blood the spirit the
[47:38] water and the blood
[47:40] is actually talking about the sancti
[47:43] just
[47:44] justification sanctification and baptism
[47:47] of the holy spirit
[47:49] now water here symbolizes
[47:52] justification blood symbolizes
[47:56] sanctification and spirits in blood
[47:59] baptism of the holy spirit now this is
[48:01] these three
[48:03] were the three stages these are the
[48:06] three stages of grace and they all agree
[48:09] in one salvation now you are saved if
[48:12] you go through all that but now
[48:14] we see that verse seven is actually
[48:16] speaking on
[48:18] the uh the godhead
[48:21] okay the father the son and the holy
[48:24] spirit these are one okay they're not
[48:25] agreeing in one
[48:27] but they are actually one are you
[48:28] following that
[48:30] but when you look at niv verse seven for
[48:33] them is
[48:34] for there are three that testify full
[48:36] stop
[48:39] they stop there it doesn't bring out the
[48:41] whole point
[48:42] he doesn't even talk about anything
[48:45] verse seven is chopped off
[48:47] so if you're reading niv you literally
[48:49] have no
[48:50] understanding of the scripture you don't
[48:51] have that scripture at all
[48:53] so some of these bibles which are called
[48:56] bibles are
[48:57] as are school textbooks and theologia
[48:59] theological textbooks
[49:00] they are not really bibles that you can
[49:02] say their bibles and so that's why we
[49:04] really want to encourage our people
[49:06] to buy the kjv at least there you are
[49:10] certainly sure that you are going to
[49:11] have
[49:12] a proper expression of scripture
[49:16] and the question was about genesis and
[49:19] revelation and i wanted to first show
[49:20] you what bible to read
[49:22] which bible should you read which bible
[49:24] should you consider as the
[49:26] as the right bible and i wanted to say
[49:28] that please the right version of the
[49:29] bible
[49:30] is the 66 book version of the bi of the
[49:32] kjv bible
[49:33] and i'm sure that that will be a
[49:35] blessing to you if you can buy it and
[49:36] read it
[49:37] now of course even our luganda bible and
[49:40] many other languages
[49:41] it is not the correct translation many
[49:44] of the scriptures are chopped out
[49:45] they are following after the niv and
[49:46] other versions but nonetheless the word
[49:48] of god is the same
[49:49] and the word of god cannot be they can
[49:52] try to chop it out from their books but
[49:54] the word of god cannot be chopped out
[49:56] it is always the child of god will
[49:58] always find it
[50:00] praise the name of the lord so now we
[50:02] find out that uh
[50:06] the book of revelation and the book of
[50:08] genesis the devil hates it much
[50:11] and the reason why the devil hates it
[50:12] much the prophet has given us a reason
[50:14] if you can
[50:15] project that once again he said have you
[50:16] ever noticed how saturn has
[50:18] two books in the bible more than all
[50:20] others
[50:22] and it says he says that uh
[50:25] in it says the book of genesis and the
[50:28] book of revelation
[50:29] in both of these books we find saturn
[50:33] we we find saturn his origin
[50:38] his awful ways and his destruction three
[50:41] things
[50:43] saturn is origin his awful ways
[50:48] and his destruction it is all
[50:52] the other books are inspired but
[50:55] in these two books genesis shows the
[50:58] beginning
[50:59] the origin of saturn
[51:03] and revelation shows
[51:07] his end or his destruction
[51:10] and and the scripture which i read in
[51:11] the book of genesis chapter 2
[51:14] verse 17 shows us the origins
[51:19] it shows that saturn has that tree of
[51:21] knowledge
[51:22] of good and evil one person one day told
[51:25] me oh there we are true
[51:26] three trees in the middle of the garden
[51:28] and i told him what were those trees he
[51:30] said
[51:31] the first tree was the tree of knowledge
[51:35] the second tree was a tree of evil
[51:39] and the third tree was the tree of life
[51:42] i said no
[51:43] you need to read the scripture again
[51:46] what does it read
[51:47] give it to us again brother verse 17 but
[51:50] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[51:51] evil
[51:53] thou shalt not eat of it
[51:56] for in a day that thou eat is thereof
[52:00] thou shalt surely die now
[52:03] can you give us that verse before the
[52:06] verse
[52:08] 17 come on scroll down to verse 16
[52:13] and the lord god said commanded man the
[52:15] man
[52:16] saying of every tree of the god and thou
[52:18] may freely eat
[52:21] so how many trees were they
[52:26] all right now he says wait and the lord
[52:29] commanded man the man
[52:30] saying of every tree of the garden thou
[52:33] mayest freely eat now
[52:35] verse 16 is talking about the trees
[52:40] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[52:43] freely
[52:44] eat now this here is talking about
[52:48] many trees including papaya
[52:51] including jackfruit including
[52:55] passion juices and everything that you
[52:57] know of the trees that you know of that
[52:59] bear those fruits
[53:00] now he says the trees
[53:03] from the fruits of those trees you can
[53:06] go ahead and eat
[53:08] okay can you give me verse 15.
[53:15] okay okay now i'm looking for another
[53:18] pass go down go down go down
[53:24] okay no no no no no i'm not looking for
[53:27] that can you find the tree of life
[53:29] uh let let's uh let's look at that
[53:31] closely
[53:35] not not not not right there genesis
[53:39] chapter 2
[53:41] uh if you can open in your bibles
[53:48] genesis chapter 2 verse 8
[53:51] verse 8
[53:55] 8 shows us all the trees very well
[53:59] and the lord god planted a garden
[54:02] eastward in eden
[54:03] and there he put the man whom he had
[54:06] formed
[54:07] and out of the ground may the lord go to
[54:10] grow every tree that is pleasant to the
[54:12] sight
[54:14] and oh what are you doing
[54:17] can you verse
[54:28] okay verse eight and the lord god
[54:30] planted a garden eastward in eden
[54:32] and there he put the man whom he had
[54:35] formed
[54:36] verse nine now here is a garden okay he
[54:38] has put man all right
[54:39] and verse nine and out of the ground
[54:41] made them lord
[54:43] god to grow every tree that is pleasant
[54:49] every tree that is pleasant to the site
[54:53] and good for food okay
[54:56] now did you see that full color in there
[54:58] please highlight that part
[55:01] the everett tree that is pleasing to the
[55:05] and good for food now that part
[55:09] which is talking of every tree that is
[55:12] pleasing to the site and
[55:13] good for food that's the part where he's
[55:16] talking about
[55:17] all the rest of the trees that we know
[55:18] today you can mention them can you give
[55:20] me some examples
[55:22] purple tree uh-huh mango tree huh
[55:26] orange tree uh-huh apple tree huh all
[55:28] those trees
[55:30] that are good and pleasing to the side
[55:31] and good for food okay
[55:33] now and he continues and he says the
[55:35] tree of life also
[55:36] in the midst of the garden
[55:40] now highlight this one the tree of life
[55:42] also in the midst of the garden now the
[55:44] tree of life
[55:46] is not a tree
[55:49] like purple tree this one now
[55:52] is talking about a person and this
[55:55] person
[55:56] because this one is used figuratively
[55:59] according to
[56:00] we will not go there but you can write
[56:01] the scripture down
[56:03] psalms chapter 1 he says that blessed is
[56:06] the man who walks not in the cast of the
[56:08] ungodly shall be like a tree planted by
[56:09] the waters
[56:10] but by the waters now we see that uh
[56:14] the tree usually in the scripture
[56:17] means person so the tree of life here is
[56:21] a person
[56:22] and this person is the person of christ
[56:24] it's god himself
[56:26] who was the tree of life and where was
[56:28] he
[56:29] in the middles of the garden now we
[56:31] continue on and he says
[56:32] and the tree so now this is the third
[56:35] tree
[56:36] this is the third category and a tree of
[56:39] knowledge
[56:40] of good and evil now the tree of
[56:43] knowledge was one tree
[56:44] but this tree of knowledge had two
[56:46] elements in it
[56:48] the first thing was good and the last
[56:52] words
[56:52] evil so what was that okay now of course
[56:56] i'm not
[56:56] dwelling much on this and i just wanted
[56:58] to just show you an idea here but maybe
[57:00] when we are talking on the serpent seed
[57:02] we shall be able to go in details and
[57:03] talk about it but
[57:05] i wanted to give you a little
[57:07] understanding here
[57:08] that there are three categories of trees
[57:12] that were in the garden of eden the
[57:15] first category
[57:16] of the trees that was in the garden of
[57:18] eden was the first category
[57:20] was the trees that were good for food
[57:23] number one
[57:24] the second category was the trees that
[57:27] was
[57:28] called the tree of life that was one
[57:30] tree and that i told you means god
[57:33] and the third category was the tree of
[57:37] knowledge now the tree of knowledge and
[57:39] the tree of life were both in the middle
[57:41] of the garden now the tree of knowledge
[57:43] that was the devil the serpent
[57:49] and uh of course there are many
[57:50] scriptures we support this but like i
[57:52] said i'm not going into the
[57:54] depth of the study for that one for
[57:56] today if you have any further questions
[57:58] about this
[57:59] you can send them on and we shall take
[58:01] it on later
[58:02] but i wanted to show you that
[58:06] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[58:09] is the devil that the bible also says
[58:12] maybe you can search out that quickly
[58:14] and get it for me it says that thou
[58:17] were what perfect in his ways he was
[58:19] perfect in his ways
[58:21] until iniquity was found
[58:25] in him okay let me let me try to find i
[58:28] think it is in the book of ezekiel
[58:30] okay uh if you can open it up together
[58:33] with me
[58:34] ezekiel chapter
[58:38] 28 get there quickly
[58:41] ezekiel ezekiel chapter 28
[58:45] okay now i want i will read just a few
[58:48] verses
[58:49] to emphasize on this point
[58:56] it's it's a very long reading so allow
[58:58] me to read only from verse seven
[59:01] okay ezekiel chapter 28
[59:04] verse 7 behold there i therefore i will
[59:08] bring
[59:08] strangers upon thee the terrible
[59:12] of the nations and they shall drown
[59:13] their swords against the beauty of thy
[59:15] wisdom
[59:16] and they shall defile thy brightness
[59:19] they shall bring
[59:20] forth verse 8
[59:24] they shall bring thee down to the pit
[59:26] and
[59:27] thou shalt die the death of them that
[59:29] are slain in the midst of the sins verse
[59:32] 9
[59:33] wilt thou yet say before him that saith
[59:35] thee i am god
[59:37] but thou shalt be a man and no god in
[59:40] the
[59:40] mind of of him that slave thee
[59:43] thou shalt die the deaths of the
[59:45] uncircumcised
[59:47] by the hand of the strangers for i have
[59:48] spoken it saith the lord
[59:50] god moreover the word of god the lord
[59:53] came unto me saying
[59:55] son of of man take up
[59:58] a lamentation upon the king of tyrus now
[1:00:00] the king of tyra's probably
[1:00:02] this could have been existed but also
[1:00:05] the king of terrorists is figurative
[1:00:06] here
[1:00:07] to talk uh or to refresh the devil
[1:00:09] lucifer
[1:00:11] and as he continues to describe the king
[1:00:13] of terrors
[1:00:14] you will notice he's not a man okay
[1:00:16] you'll notice that this is
[1:00:17] more than a man he was an angel he was a
[1:00:19] carob in heaven but then
[1:00:21] of course because of uh uh of
[1:00:24] backsliding
[1:00:25] you know he was he became the devil
[1:00:30] take up a lamentation upon the king of
[1:00:31] terrorists and say unto him that saith
[1:00:33] the lord god thou seriously have the son
[1:00:35] full of wisdom and perfect in beauty
[1:00:37] perfect in beauty not that one thou has
[1:00:40] been in head in the garden of god he has
[1:00:42] also been in eden right
[1:00:44] every preacher stone was thy covering
[1:00:46] the sardia stoppers and diamond and
[1:00:48] burial and honks and jasper and saffron
[1:00:50] emerald and the cabana
[1:00:51] and god the workmanship of thy tablets
[1:00:54] and
[1:00:54] the pipes was prepared in the in the day
[1:00:56] that thou was created so now
[1:00:58] we notice here that this was not born
[1:01:01] he's not a man who was born but this
[1:01:03] was something that was in the garden of
[1:01:04] eden number one number two he was
[1:01:06] perfect in beauty
[1:01:08] number three he was created okay now
[1:01:10] number 14
[1:01:12] verse 14 he says thou art the anointed
[1:01:15] cherub that covers okay now he continues
[1:01:17] on to also say
[1:01:18] he is not only created he was not only
[1:01:21] perfect in beauty
[1:01:22] he is not only in the garden of eden but
[1:01:25] also
[1:01:27] he was the anointed angel kero
[1:01:31] of course we know there are many types
[1:01:32] of angels there there are caribs there
[1:01:34] are
[1:01:35] there are some suffers and they are also
[1:01:38] the
[1:01:39] the normal angels the main types of
[1:01:40] angels but for him
[1:01:42] he was not just any type he was a kid he
[1:01:45] was a general
[1:01:46] in this angelic angelica real
[1:01:51] my mind we can just go ahead and study
[1:01:52] all through but um i wanted you to see
[1:01:55] verse 15 thou
[1:01:58] was perfect in thy ways from the day
[1:02:02] that that was created
[1:02:04] till iniquity was found in thee
[1:02:09] now okay we don't have it here by the
[1:02:11] shame
[1:02:13] now the bible here is saying that
[1:02:16] this carob was perfect
[1:02:21] perfect can you say perfect
[1:02:27] and then what else was there apart from
[1:02:30] perfection
[1:02:31] iniquity can you say iniquity
[1:02:35] so here is something that is perfect but
[1:02:38] also having iniquity
[1:02:41] it has good and evil
[1:02:45] and who is he that has good and evil in
[1:02:48] him it is a tree of
[1:02:50] knowledge where was the tree of
[1:02:52] knowledge in the middle of the garden
[1:02:54] and we find out
[1:02:55] that the devil lucifer according to
[1:02:58] ezekiel 28 he was also
[1:03:00] in the garden of eden so we have no
[1:03:03] question at all
[1:03:04] whatsoever that this lucifer was
[1:03:07] actually
[1:03:08] the devil himself that this tree of
[1:03:10] knowledge was actually
[1:03:12] the devil himself right that is his
[1:03:14] origin
[1:03:15] and if you go in the in the depth of
[1:03:17] that teaching you understand
[1:03:19] that the devil was able to infiltrate
[1:03:23] the serpent and the serpent was able to
[1:03:27] bring forth its seed in into the human
[1:03:30] and mingle it
[1:03:31] with a human race and from that time
[1:03:33] things went wrong
[1:03:35] and from that time sin came in and we
[1:03:38] cannot know that
[1:03:39] unless we know what the bible says in
[1:03:41] the book of genesis
[1:03:43] it is genesis that reveals the
[1:03:45] beginnings and the origin
[1:03:47] of saturn but also
[1:03:50] revelation reveals and shows the
[1:03:53] end of saturn and these two books
[1:03:57] they never hates it to the extent that
[1:04:00] many people today
[1:04:01] in the churches do not read these books
[1:04:04] why
[1:04:04] because they have no understanding of
[1:04:06] them these two books cannot be
[1:04:08] understood
[1:04:09] fully without a prophet you would need
[1:04:13] because look these two books were not
[1:04:16] written without a prophet
[1:04:20] but these two books were written
[1:04:23] we got out to use prophets for example
[1:04:26] genesis let me ask you a question
[1:04:28] who wrote the book of genesis
[1:05:49] god bless you praise the lord now we
[1:05:52] just
[1:05:53] got interrupted here but we're back on
[1:05:55] now
[1:05:57] so i was trying to explain the point
[1:05:59] here
[1:06:00] that uh in the beginning
[1:06:03] at the first time it was actually
[1:06:07] in genesis that it reveals the origin of
[1:06:10] saturn
[1:06:11] and genesis actually
[1:06:16] is
[1:06:18] the the book that many people
[1:06:21] do not read and the reason they don't
[1:06:24] read it is simply because
[1:06:26] they don't have the understanding of it
[1:06:27] even when they really they read really
[1:06:29] a few things of course they haven't they
[1:06:31] they can try to explain
[1:06:33] and some of them like they read like
[1:06:35] poems but
[1:06:37] the understanding of of the book of
[1:06:39] genesis
[1:06:40] like god brought it through our prophet
[1:06:42] who was not even there
[1:06:44] in the same way god would bring the
[1:06:47] understanding
[1:06:48] or the revelation of it by the holy
[1:06:50] spirit through
[1:06:51] uh oh by the by a prophet through the
[1:06:54] holy spirit the help of the holy spirit
[1:06:56] and so we see that uh the book of
[1:06:58] revelation same thing
[1:07:00] god has to send a a man uh
[1:07:03] to the isle of patamus john for him to
[1:07:06] be able to see things
[1:07:08] to hear things and then to be able to
[1:07:10] write it down
[1:07:11] jesus christ himself wrote the book of j
[1:07:13] of of j
[1:07:14] of revelation uh using
[1:07:18] john and john was a prophet
[1:07:22] so we see that in the same way we will
[1:07:24] need a prophet to be able to understand
[1:07:26] the book of revelation amen amen
[1:07:30] now let us look at a
[1:07:35] a few things here
[1:07:41] i'll just read you one more quote about
[1:07:43] this i think what i've explained
[1:07:44] in this question is enough but let me
[1:07:46] read for you one quote here it says the
[1:07:48] roman catholics say it's from the church
[1:07:50] 8 book
[1:07:51] the roman catholics say that the church
[1:07:53] is built upon peter
[1:07:57] oh am i in another question
[1:08:01] i think i'm in another question excuse
[1:08:03] me
[1:08:05] okay i was supposed to read something
[1:08:07] else here
[1:08:08] yes yeah here we are uh i'll take this
[1:08:11] from the ephesian church age
[1:08:13] he says if the tree of life is a person
[1:08:16] then the tree of knowledge
[1:08:18] of good and evil is also a person
[1:08:21] it can't it can't
[1:08:24] be otherwise thus the righteous one and
[1:08:27] the wicked one
[1:08:28] stood side by side there in the midst of
[1:08:31] the garden of
[1:08:32] eden you know it is amazing
[1:08:35] the righteous one and the evil one
[1:08:39] stood what side by side
[1:08:42] and even today also in the same church
[1:08:45] there should be
[1:08:46] those two seats i've mentioned on that
[1:08:50] before
[1:08:54] therefore even in exactly what we've
[1:08:57] already read ezekiel 28 13 where he says
[1:08:59] thou saten
[1:09:00] thou which means satan has been in the
[1:09:02] garden
[1:09:03] in eden the garden of god and he says
[1:09:06] here is where we receive the true
[1:09:08] revelation of the serpent's seat
[1:09:10] here is what really happened in the
[1:09:12] garden of aden
[1:09:13] the word says that eve was be grieved by
[1:09:16] the serpent she was actually seduced
[1:09:20] the serpent so we can be able to get
[1:09:23] into that in more detail later but
[1:09:24] now we realize from these
[1:09:28] two books genesis and revelation that
[1:09:31] genesis shows the origin
[1:09:33] of saturn and revelation shows its end
[1:09:36] of course it is in the book of
[1:09:37] revelation
[1:09:38] chapter 20 verse 10 that says and the
[1:09:41] devil that deceived
[1:09:42] them that was cast into the lake of that
[1:09:45] and the devil that deceived them was
[1:09:46] cast into the lake of fire
[1:09:48] and brimstone where the beast and the
[1:09:50] false prophet
[1:09:51] are and shall be tormented day and night
[1:09:54] forever
[1:09:55] and ever so the devil was cast into the
[1:09:59] lake of fire we see his
[1:10:00] end right there in the book of
[1:10:02] revelation but
[1:10:03] how can we uh uh receive this
[1:10:06] revelation of what really happens and
[1:10:08] takes place even in the book of
[1:10:09] revelation
[1:10:10] what the devil is trying to do through
[1:10:12] the ages you know through
[1:10:13] the the horse riders the bible speaks of
[1:10:15] the horse riders the false writers
[1:10:17] how the devil you know the devil
[1:10:19] ascended the same devil
[1:10:21] you know by changing colors coming over
[1:10:23] on on and on to persecute the church
[1:10:26] the depth the book of revelation reveals
[1:10:28] that
[1:10:29] and of course you can't understand that
[1:10:31] without a god
[1:10:32] sent prophet and that's why we should
[1:10:34] thank god for
[1:10:36] answer for loving this generation and
[1:10:39] sending us
[1:10:40] a message praise the lord amen
[1:10:45] okay now we have another question here
[1:10:48] uh
[1:10:48] and this question says somebody asked
[1:10:51] and said
[1:10:55] okay i don't know if we should deal with
[1:10:56] this
[1:10:59] i think we can
[1:11:00] [Music]
[1:11:03] okay it's just brief we'll deal with it
[1:11:05] it says
[1:11:06] why does the rock stand for revelation
[1:11:10] why does the rock stand for revelation
[1:11:13] and i wanted to answer this
[1:11:16] by approaching it from matthew 17
[1:11:19] matthew 16 17 which says and jesus
[1:11:23] answered and said unto him
[1:11:25] blessed are thou simon but jonah for
[1:11:27] flesh and blood
[1:11:29] has not revealed it unto thee but my
[1:11:32] father which is in heaven
[1:11:34] and i say also unto thee that thou art
[1:11:36] peter and upon this rock i will
[1:11:39] build what
[1:11:43] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[1:11:46] against it
[1:11:47] so we notice that there is a church
[1:11:51] that christ said he will build but
[1:11:55] after he had asked who he was and
[1:11:57] everybody was giving an answer on
[1:11:59] who he was then simon peter said
[1:12:03] thou art christ the son of the living
[1:12:05] god
[1:12:06] of course we talked about that so we
[1:12:08] know that some of the living word means
[1:12:09] god in flesh right
[1:12:11] so now once peter received that
[1:12:13] revelation
[1:12:15] jesus definitely knew where he had
[1:12:17] picked the revelation from
[1:12:20] he says for flesh and blood has not done
[1:12:22] what
[1:12:24] revealed these things unto you but my
[1:12:27] father in heaven
[1:12:28] has revealed it
[1:12:32] can you convert that together for flesh
[1:12:34] and blood
[1:12:36] has not read that again
[1:12:39] has not no no you're reading it very
[1:12:42] lazily has not
[1:12:44] revealed it unto thee
[1:12:48] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[1:12:52] thee now
[1:12:52] remember he's talking about a revelation
[1:12:56] in other words peter what of course
[1:12:58] peter the word peter means a little rock
[1:13:00] so now many people many people think
[1:13:02] that
[1:13:02] the the church was built on peter
[1:13:05] but no he says thou art peter
[1:13:09] and upon this rock he's not saying that
[1:13:11] peter
[1:13:12] this rock you peter no but he's trying
[1:13:14] to say
[1:13:15] flesh and blood has not revealed it unto
[1:13:18] thee
[1:13:18] but my father in heaven has revealed it
[1:13:21] and upon this
[1:13:23] rock and brother banamiya gives the
[1:13:26] answer
[1:13:26] and he says the roman catholic said that
[1:13:28] the church is built upon peter
[1:13:31] but now that is really canon how could
[1:13:34] god build the church upon a man so
[1:13:36] unstable
[1:13:36] that he denied the lord jesus and cast
[1:13:38] while doing it
[1:13:40] god can't do this church upon any man
[1:13:42] born in sin
[1:13:44] and it wasn't some rock lying there as
[1:13:47] though
[1:13:47] god had hollowed the ground at that spot
[1:13:52] yes and it isn't
[1:13:55] as the pentecostals the protestants say
[1:13:57] that the church is built upon jesus
[1:14:03] jesus is not even here today so if the
[1:14:05] church was built upon jesus
[1:14:06] you know what they did they they went
[1:14:09] and took
[1:14:10] the the body of peter batted it under do
[1:14:13] the big church call it
[1:14:14] saint peter's basilica so now this is
[1:14:16] the church the only teacher
[1:14:19] he's not talking about the body of jesus
[1:14:23] he's not even talking about peter but he
[1:14:26] says it was
[1:14:27] the revelation
[1:14:30] read it the way it is written
[1:14:33] flesh and blood has not revealed it but
[1:14:36] my father has revealed it and upon this
[1:14:39] rock meaning upon this revelation
[1:14:44] ask yourself what revelation upon the
[1:14:47] revelation that you peter have
[1:14:52] of who jesus christ is upon
[1:14:56] the revelation of jesus christ peter
[1:14:58] heard of him
[1:15:01] hallelujah the church of jesus christ is
[1:15:04] built upon the revelation of jesus
[1:15:07] christ
[1:15:08] the church of jesus christ is built upon
[1:15:11] a revelation
[1:15:12] that peter had of jesus
[1:15:15] and what was that revelation that god
[1:15:18] himself
[1:15:19] has come in place
[1:15:22] hallelujah god has come in flesh
[1:15:26] that is the revelation god is as put on
[1:15:30] flesh and is dwelling among us
[1:15:32] that is the revelation so now what is
[1:15:36] the rock the rock is a revelation
[1:15:38] of who jesus christ is no man can go
[1:15:41] into the rapture unless they have
[1:15:43] understood or
[1:15:44] received the revelation of who jesus
[1:15:47] christ
[1:15:48] is and upon this revelation
[1:15:52] upon this rock i will build my church
[1:15:55] the church is built on the revelation on
[1:15:57] the thus saith the lord
[1:16:00] the church is built on who jesus christ
[1:16:02] is and jesus christ
[1:16:03] who is he he is hebrews 13 8
[1:16:07] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:16:09] and forever
[1:16:10] which means it has not changed but if he
[1:16:12] just said the church was built upon
[1:16:14] jesus hallelujah
[1:16:15] hey wait a moment jesus does not
[1:16:18] live in the world today physically
[1:16:20] speaking so does it mean the church is
[1:16:22] dead
[1:16:22] no the church is continuing but the
[1:16:25] church is
[1:16:26] built upon the revelation
[1:16:29] of jesus christ the revelation
[1:16:33] of jesus christ the revelation that
[1:16:36] peter had
[1:16:37] and you two must receive that revelation
[1:16:39] no one is going to go in the rapture
[1:16:40] unless you receive that revelation of
[1:16:42] jesus christ being
[1:16:44] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:16:48] praise the name of the lord amen i think
[1:16:51] that answers that question
[1:16:52] okay now there is one question i was
[1:16:55] really
[1:16:55] trying to get was trying bad to get to
[1:16:58] eat
[1:17:00] and uh because this question is going to
[1:17:03] answer three questions in one
[1:17:04] and people asked this question some
[1:17:07] sisters they asked this question
[1:17:09] um and they said one question says can
[1:17:12] one have the holy ghost when he
[1:17:14] is not baptized
[1:17:18] can one have the holy spirit when he is
[1:17:20] not baptized
[1:17:23] some people are saying here no are there
[1:17:24] anyone saying yes
[1:17:30] can you have the holy spirit when you're
[1:17:32] not baptized or before you are baptized
[1:17:35] some people are saying yes others are
[1:17:36] saying no okay
[1:17:39] some people are saying yes now even
[1:17:40] those who are saying no are saying yes
[1:17:42] so i don't know you don't know you do
[1:17:44] not know what to believe okay
[1:17:46] then the other question which i want to
[1:17:48] ask
[1:17:49] here which i want to also say because it
[1:17:52] rhymes with the others there are two
[1:17:53] more
[1:17:54] one said the books mainly tell us
[1:17:58] to receive the holy ghost so that we can
[1:18:01] understand something
[1:18:02] some things can be revealed to us but
[1:18:04] now
[1:18:05] how does the holy ghost get to us how
[1:18:07] does the holy ghost get to you
[1:18:09] how do you receive the holy spirit okay
[1:18:13] now question numbers uh well i have it
[1:18:16] here as number seven
[1:18:17] now but it is still the same uh uh on
[1:18:20] the same line he said
[1:18:22] are there any other reason
[1:18:27] is there i think are there any other
[1:18:29] reasons why we are immersed in water
[1:18:31] during baptism apart from
[1:18:35] it being for a good conscience toward
[1:18:37] god of course
[1:18:39] this sister might have read or must have
[1:18:40] read this
[1:18:42] from the church edge book uh
[1:18:45] actually she might have quoted for me
[1:18:47] the place
[1:18:48] where she read it let me pick up a
[1:18:50] question quickly here in a moment
[1:18:55] well uh she quotes that being from
[1:18:59] uh can you pick it up for me someone see
[1:19:01] you with it
[1:19:02] read for me uh page
[1:19:05] uh page paragraph two
[1:19:09] page 28 paragraph two that's where she
[1:19:11] gets that
[1:19:12] uh she gets that portion and i think i
[1:19:14] also might have put it somewhere around
[1:19:17] here
[1:19:17] okay uh i think i'll read it later
[1:19:20] because i have that portion of it but
[1:19:21] maybe those of you want to underline it
[1:19:23] and see so remember those questions are
[1:19:26] three
[1:19:27] because you don't have a microphone
[1:19:28] there right so now the the
[1:19:30] the questions are three the first
[1:19:31] question is can one
[1:19:33] have the holy ghost when he is not
[1:19:35] baptized
[1:19:37] or i should even add one is not baptized
[1:19:39] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:19:41] because someone can be baptized
[1:19:43] but wrongly and what are the examples of
[1:19:46] wrong baptism
[1:19:48] the examples of wrong water baptisms
[1:19:52] are the following one
[1:19:55] you might be baptized in water but you
[1:19:58] were baptized against your will
[1:20:02] that's not considered as baptism
[1:20:05] number two you might be baptizing water
[1:20:08] but when you are
[1:20:09] when you are when you do not know what
[1:20:11] was happening
[1:20:12] you you were you were baptized but you
[1:20:15] did not know what was happening you did
[1:20:16] not make your own decision someone else
[1:20:18] made it
[1:20:18] the decision for you that too is not
[1:20:21] water baptism
[1:20:23] number three you might be baptized in
[1:20:25] much water even in the name of jesus
[1:20:27] christ but actually
[1:20:30] you uh uh did not these two things have
[1:20:33] said
[1:20:34] you didn't make the decision you didn't
[1:20:35] know what was happening uh maybe you're
[1:20:37] too young to understand
[1:20:38] or maybe you do not uh you know so you
[1:20:41] you you really wanted you didn't know
[1:20:42] what
[1:20:43] what you believed then and uh you didn't
[1:20:45] practically make the decision by
[1:20:47] yourself you you did not repent of your
[1:20:48] sins
[1:20:49] therefore that does not concern as a as
[1:20:51] baptism because it has to be something
[1:20:53] that you have
[1:20:54] made up your own choice now
[1:20:57] the other wrong example of baptism is
[1:20:59] when someone is baptized in much water
[1:21:03] but they are not baptized in the name of
[1:21:07] our lord jesus christ
[1:21:09] that too is not considered to be true
[1:21:12] water baptism now
[1:21:13] also there are those who have placed
[1:21:14] babies that too is not considered as a
[1:21:17] right or whatever baptism so the
[1:21:19] question is
[1:21:20] regardless of whether you are baptized
[1:21:23] in the right name
[1:21:24] or in the wrong way the question is i
[1:21:26] don't want to look at the wrong way i
[1:21:27] want to look at the right way
[1:21:30] before you are baptized in the name of
[1:21:32] our lord jesus christ
[1:21:33] can you receive the holy ghost that's
[1:21:35] the question i believe
[1:21:38] and some people said no another said yes
[1:21:41] and the other question says now how can
[1:21:44] the holy spirit get to you
[1:21:46] the other question was like uh is there
[1:21:49] any other reason for baptism
[1:21:51] apart from being it being an answer to
[1:21:53] good conscience before god
[1:21:54] now i thought these are very interesting
[1:21:56] questions and i think we should deal
[1:21:58] with them as well
[1:22:00] now i'm going to begin by reading acts
[1:22:03] chapter 2
[1:22:04] verse 37 try it again now it says now
[1:22:07] when they had this
[1:22:09] i'm reading verse 37 now when they had
[1:22:12] this they were pricked in their heart
[1:22:14] and said unto peter
[1:22:15] and to the rest of the apostles men and
[1:22:18] brethren
[1:22:18] what shall we do then peter said unto
[1:22:21] them repent and be baptized every one of
[1:22:24] you in the name of jesus christ
[1:22:26] for the remission of what sins
[1:22:29] and he shall do what receive the holy
[1:22:32] ghost
[1:22:34] the gift to the holy ghost for the
[1:22:36] promise is unto you and
[1:22:37] your children and to all that are far
[1:22:38] off even as many as the lord our god
[1:22:40] shall call now
[1:22:41] the conclusion that everybody will have
[1:22:44] will be
[1:22:45] you know you see the bible says repent
[1:22:48] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:22:50] christ
[1:22:50] for your sins to be washed away and
[1:22:52] fully receive the spirit
[1:22:53] the holy spirit so can you receive the
[1:22:56] holy spirit before you baptized
[1:22:58] no how come because he said repent
[1:23:02] then be baptized then your sins are
[1:23:04] washed away then you receive the holy
[1:23:06] ghost
[1:23:06] but i do not want you to look at it that
[1:23:09] way
[1:23:10] i want you to look at it this way the
[1:23:13] bible did not say
[1:23:17] that they should receive baptism
[1:23:21] first it wasn't baptism
[1:23:24] in itself with a baptism in itself that
[1:23:27] gave them the holy ghost
[1:23:29] are you following me what does the bible
[1:23:32] say
[1:23:33] the bible says rep because nana you need
[1:23:36] to understand this
[1:23:37] and i need to give it as a disclaimer
[1:23:38] now because we do water baptism and many
[1:23:41] people think
[1:23:43] oh i am being baptized to be saved
[1:23:47] water baptism does not wash away your
[1:23:50] sins
[1:23:54] scripture has said it and we will quote
[1:23:57] it
[1:23:58] if you have your bible if you have a pen
[1:24:00] and paper and you want to write it down
[1:24:02] and you read it later please do
[1:24:07] in the book of uh
[1:24:11] first peter chapter three verses
[1:24:16] uh 21
[1:24:21] the like figure we're unto even baptism
[1:24:24] does also save
[1:24:25] now save us so peter says
[1:24:28] baptism now does what serves us
[1:24:32] but does it really literally mean that
[1:24:34] the water that you are baptized in
[1:24:36] is going to wash your sins away no no
[1:24:39] way
[1:24:41] he is trying to say baptism serves
[1:24:44] us how by the he says not the putting
[1:24:48] away of the field of the flesh
[1:24:51] it doesn't wash away your sins like you
[1:24:52] go to wash because you are nothing no
[1:24:55] do not have the old testament concept of
[1:24:57] naman
[1:24:58] going to watch his reprocessing
[1:25:01] but he says it's not washing away of the
[1:25:04] putting away the filter of the flesh
[1:25:06] but it says it is the answer of a good
[1:25:09] conscious toward god
[1:25:11] by the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:25:14] so baptism in itself does not
[1:25:17] save us it doesn't give us the holy
[1:25:21] ghost in itself now
[1:25:22] notice i'd not say but we cannot we can
[1:25:26] receive the holy ghost without baptism
[1:25:28] but i said baptism as the act in
[1:25:31] itself does not wash the person's sins
[1:25:35] and does not give the person the holy
[1:25:38] ghost
[1:25:39] but what does follow me closely
[1:25:45] the bible says repent tell them
[1:25:48] what it is what should we do he didn't
[1:25:51] say
[1:25:51] baptize yourselves and you'll see the
[1:25:53] holy ghost but it says repent
[1:25:55] that's the very first thing so the first
[1:25:59] thing to do for
[1:26:00] everyone that wants to receive the holy
[1:26:02] ghost
[1:26:04] is to do what to repent
[1:26:08] but now the question then comes what is
[1:26:10] repentance
[1:26:14] can someone who has not believed
[1:26:18] repent no
[1:26:21] can you repent without believing no you
[1:26:24] repent of your sins
[1:26:25] after hearing the gospel
[1:26:28] believing the gospel then you repent
[1:26:34] so what comes fast is faith
[1:26:40] after faith comes repentance after
[1:26:42] repentance then comes
[1:26:43] the works of faith
[1:26:48] and then after the works of faith then
[1:26:50] comes
[1:26:51] the holy ghost okay now but here the
[1:26:54] best is here
[1:26:54] is faith let us uh
[1:26:58] look at mark 16 as we examine this a
[1:27:00] little further
[1:27:03] verse 15 and he said unto them
[1:27:06] go into all the world and preach the
[1:27:09] gospel to every
[1:27:11] christian he that does what
[1:27:14] he that is baptized shall be saved does
[1:27:17] it say that
[1:27:18] come on now answer me what does it say
[1:27:22] he that does what believeth
[1:27:26] fast believing never forget that
[1:27:29] or else if it was baptism that is giving
[1:27:32] people the holy ghost and salvation will
[1:27:33] just simply be going
[1:27:34] and collecting every people on the roads
[1:27:36] and you tell them let's go for water
[1:27:38] baptism
[1:27:39] we push them some of them we kick them
[1:27:41] like like noah kicked
[1:27:42] easy people to go in the act
[1:27:46] we are not going to kick anyone to go
[1:27:48] for water baptism
[1:27:51] if you were kicked to go for a baptism
[1:27:53] you have to do it over again if you
[1:27:54] really feel that you should do it if you
[1:27:55] really believe
[1:27:57] the very first thing that you must do my
[1:27:59] brother is to believe
[1:28:04] if you have not believed you are not a
[1:28:07] candidate for what a baptism
[1:28:10] if you are not a believer you are not a
[1:28:12] candidate for baptism
[1:28:15] okay so believing fast and then is
[1:28:18] baptized then shall be
[1:28:19] saved okay let us go on on to another
[1:28:22] verse
[1:28:22] romans chapter 10 because how do you
[1:28:24] believe that that's another question
[1:28:26] okay
[1:28:26] how do you believe them do you believe
[1:28:29] because your parents are believers or do
[1:28:30] you believe because your mother
[1:28:32] or friend or sister whatever is a
[1:28:33] believer no romans 10
[1:28:36] verse 13 please follow me please follow
[1:28:39] me closely now
[1:28:41] these are very very good points for
[1:28:44] whosoever
[1:28:44] shall toll i wish i had somebody who was
[1:28:46] reading for me the scriptures now
[1:28:49] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:28:54] the lord shall be saved
[1:28:57] hallelujah
[1:29:02] whosoever shall call upon the name of
[1:29:04] the lord
[1:29:05] the bible says the scripture says shall
[1:29:07] be
[1:29:08] the same oh i thought the bible said
[1:29:12] that he was whoever believeth and his
[1:29:13] baptism shall be saved
[1:29:15] so then how come that you only need to
[1:29:17] call upon the name of the lord and you
[1:29:19] will be saved
[1:29:20] no wait a moment can you call on the one
[1:29:23] that you do not know
[1:29:24] he even continues to say how then shall
[1:29:26] they call on him
[1:29:27] in whom they have not believed so you
[1:29:29] cannot recall on the name of the lord
[1:29:31] unless you are believed so it's not like
[1:29:33] saying
[1:29:33] i don't believe but i just built i just
[1:29:36] i just love jesus
[1:29:37] i love jesus jesus save me
[1:29:40] because i sing and i have a nice voice
[1:29:42] and i can jump up and down and speak in
[1:29:44] tongues
[1:29:45] i i will go on with my persecution and
[1:29:47] everything but just save me because i've
[1:29:48] called upon your name no
[1:29:51] when he's saying calling upon the name
[1:29:53] of the lord he is saying calling upon
[1:29:55] the name of the lord with the
[1:29:56] understanding also
[1:29:59] with the faith also you understand
[1:30:02] yes the bible says that at the mention
[1:30:05] of the name of jesus every knee shall
[1:30:08] bow
[1:30:08] every tongue shall confess that jesus
[1:30:11] christ is lord
[1:30:12] and now his name is the name above every
[1:30:15] name and
[1:30:16] everybody shall now listen
[1:30:19] does it mean that everybody even if they
[1:30:21] don't believe they just mention
[1:30:22] jesus and then they are healed no no way
[1:30:26] it is accompanied with faith okay
[1:30:30] you don't just say jesus serve me jesus
[1:30:32] human then it just happens because you
[1:30:34] mentioned the name of jesus
[1:30:35] jesus must be mentioned with faith
[1:30:41] like that man came to jesus and he told
[1:30:45] him please i believe you go
[1:30:48] and uh just mention the word and my
[1:30:51] child will be well
[1:30:52] just mention the word and my child will
[1:30:54] be well that man believed
[1:30:56] and because he believed he had faith
[1:31:00] when he mentioned the name jesus
[1:31:03] it did something for him so it's all
[1:31:05] about faith it's not about
[1:31:07] just speaking i don't want
[1:31:11] okay you know how shall they call in
[1:31:14] whom
[1:31:15] on him in whom they have not believed
[1:31:17] and how shall they believe in
[1:31:19] him of whom they have not had and how
[1:31:21] shall they hear
[1:31:22] without a preacher how shall they hear
[1:31:24] without a preacher
[1:31:26] and how shall they preach except they be
[1:31:28] sent you see
[1:31:29] as it is written how beautiful are the
[1:31:31] feet of them that preach the gospel of
[1:31:32] peace
[1:31:33] and bring glad tidings of good things
[1:31:35] but they have not all obeyed the gospel
[1:31:37] for it
[1:31:37] said that this was our report so then
[1:31:40] faith comes by what
[1:31:41] by hearing and hearing by what the word
[1:31:44] of god
[1:31:45] okay now i see you brother somewhere i
[1:31:48] think the family
[1:31:50] there you are struggling with the zoom
[1:31:52] if zoom is not working for you to have
[1:31:54] continuity of thought
[1:31:55] it's very good for you to go to youtube
[1:31:57] so you can be able to follow along well
[1:31:59] and you don't miss out on this because
[1:32:02] the people who ask that question
[1:32:04] might want to hear the answers to this
[1:32:06] we don't want to
[1:32:07] just cut cut the thought you want to be
[1:32:09] able to follow
[1:32:10] now are you seeing
[1:32:14] the progression of this first is calling
[1:32:17] upon the name of the lord
[1:32:18] number one if you call in the name of
[1:32:20] the lord you are what
[1:32:21] you will be saved number one number two
[1:32:25] how can you call on him unless you
[1:32:27] believe so then you must believe before
[1:32:29] you call in the name of the lord
[1:32:30] but then how can you believe without
[1:32:32] hearing the gospel of being pretty fast
[1:32:33] so then before you believe you have
[1:32:35] first hear someone preaching but then
[1:32:37] how can you hear someone preaching
[1:32:39] unless someone has been sent to you
[1:32:41] all right so then you must hear someone
[1:32:43] who is sent not just
[1:32:45] anyone that i had a drunkard speaking
[1:32:47] and then i believe no
[1:32:48] it must be someone sent but then how can
[1:32:50] he be sent how can he preach except he
[1:32:52] be sent
[1:32:53] to understand so now you need to sit
[1:32:56] under
[1:32:57] a ministry of the preaching of the word
[1:33:01] by someone that has been sent by god
[1:33:05] and then when you hear the word being
[1:33:07] preached and you believe it
[1:33:09] and you accept it then and only then
[1:33:13] can you say i have believed it all right
[1:33:16] after believing it and making your
[1:33:18] decision
[1:33:20] then and only then can you call on the
[1:33:21] name of the lord
[1:33:23] and how do you call in the name of the
[1:33:25] lord you call in the name of the lord
[1:33:27] by confessing your sins how do you
[1:33:30] confess your sins
[1:33:31] you say i accept i'm a sinner i accept
[1:33:34] the lord as my lord and savior
[1:33:36] and from today i have decided to follow
[1:33:39] him and accept
[1:33:40] him as lord and savior of my life
[1:33:43] and when the moment you do that
[1:33:46] the moment you do that is the moment
[1:33:49] that you are ready now for water baptism
[1:33:52] you are not ready for water baptism
[1:33:54] until that time
[1:33:56] if you were baptized before you made
[1:33:59] that decision
[1:34:00] oh let me tell you you are not baptized
[1:34:03] you have to be baptized over again
[1:34:06] because
[1:34:07] water baptism in itself people think oh
[1:34:10] let me just go in the water so i i can
[1:34:12] be saved
[1:34:12] no water doesn't wash away your sins
[1:34:15] water doesn't give you the holy ghost
[1:34:17] but water is only an answer to for a
[1:34:20] good conscience
[1:34:21] before god it is
[1:34:24] something to identify you with christ
[1:34:27] in his death body and resurrection
[1:34:30] water is something
[1:34:34] that uh that activates your faith or
[1:34:37] rather that
[1:34:38] proves your faith
[1:34:42] so first the important thing for you
[1:34:46] before you receive the holy ghost is
[1:34:50] having faith in god and how can you
[1:34:52] faith in god how can you have faith in
[1:34:53] god unless you have had the gospel being
[1:34:55] preached
[1:34:56] and how can you hear the gospel being
[1:34:57] preached with unless you sit under
[1:34:59] someone preaching it you can't say i'll
[1:35:01] just read it myself and then i
[1:35:02] understand no
[1:35:03] you have to sit under the preaching of
[1:35:05] the word and after sitting under the
[1:35:06] preaching of the word and you make a
[1:35:08] decision then that preacher
[1:35:09] baptizes you all right okay now
[1:35:12] let us take this even a little bit
[1:35:14] further
[1:35:16] james chapter 2 verse 17 says james
[1:35:19] chapter 2
[1:35:22] 17
[1:35:25] okay just a moment here we have a
[1:35:28] problem
[1:35:29] uh with uh with someone coming on
[1:35:33] who is not muted
[1:35:36] okay now let us uh
[1:35:39] look at this scripture in gems
[1:35:42] it says even so faith if it has not
[1:35:46] worked
[1:35:46] is dead being alone yeah a man may say
[1:35:50] thou has faith and i have words show me
[1:35:52] thy faith without thy words and i will
[1:35:54] show thee my faith by my
[1:35:56] words hallelujah amen thou believers
[1:35:59] that there is one god and that was where
[1:36:01] the devils also they believe
[1:36:03] and they tremble but without all
[1:36:06] knowing man that faith without works is
[1:36:11] they never too can can speak jesus
[1:36:15] they never talk and believe that there
[1:36:17] is one god
[1:36:18] so everybody says i believe there is god
[1:36:20] in heaven yeah ever even they never
[1:36:21] believe that is good in heaven
[1:36:23] but you your faith must go to an
[1:36:27] extent whereby you do something to prove
[1:36:30] that you have faith
[1:36:31] in god you must put it to work
[1:36:36] you must put your faith to work
[1:36:39] and how do you put your faith to work by
[1:36:41] water baptism
[1:36:43] you are you can read romans 6 1 and 6
[1:36:46] from one on down to six and you will say
[1:36:49] that indeed faith uh
[1:36:53] shows you are uh
[1:36:56] that you believe but you must show it by
[1:36:58] your watch now i want to see
[1:37:01] a scenario here and before i do let us
[1:37:04] first try to make
[1:37:05] a reconstruction of this so the question
[1:37:08] was
[1:37:09] can i receive the holy ghost before i'm
[1:37:12] baptized
[1:37:13] and the answer is yes you can receive
[1:37:16] the holy ghost
[1:37:17] the moment you believe the moment you
[1:37:20] have faith in god
[1:37:22] what gives you faith in god rather what
[1:37:26] gives you
[1:37:26] the holy ghost is faith and what gives
[1:37:30] you faith is the word of god
[1:37:32] and what what is the word of god the
[1:37:34] word of god is that which we preach you
[1:37:36] must believe it
[1:37:38] and part of it is that is baptism
[1:37:42] in water in the name of our lord jesus
[1:37:43] christ okay
[1:37:45] but the action
[1:37:48] whether you have done or not yet done it
[1:37:51] where you might be baptizing water
[1:37:55] in the name of our lord jesus christ
[1:37:56] when you don't really believe with all
[1:37:58] your heart
[1:37:59] can you agree many people get baptized
[1:38:02] and by the balance says they are like
[1:38:03] dry sinners going getting into dry and
[1:38:05] coming out wet but they are still
[1:38:07] sinners
[1:38:08] it didn't change a bit it isn't the
[1:38:11] water that serves people can be baptized
[1:38:13] and still go to hell
[1:38:15] so really it is your faith there are
[1:38:18] some people who will be baptized
[1:38:20] they get the holy ghost immediately and
[1:38:22] those who will be baptized and they
[1:38:23] don't get it
[1:38:24] and there are those who will get it even
[1:38:26] before they go in the water
[1:38:28] so it is to do with the condition of
[1:38:30] your heart it is to do
[1:38:32] with whether god it is only god who
[1:38:34] decides whether to give you the holy
[1:38:35] ghost or not
[1:38:36] and what touches god is only one thing
[1:38:39] faith in god
[1:38:43] and now does that certainly mean that
[1:38:46] well
[1:38:47] as long as you have faith in god you've
[1:38:49] got heaven even if you are not baptized
[1:38:51] in water in the name of our lord jesus
[1:38:52] christ
[1:38:54] oh the very reason why you ask that
[1:38:56] question is because you don't have faith
[1:38:58] yet
[1:38:59] because anybody with the holy ghost will
[1:39:03] never ask such a question
[1:39:05] anybody with the holy ghost will never
[1:39:07] ask whether or not they need to be
[1:39:08] baptized after hearing that they need to
[1:39:10] be blessed
[1:39:12] i'll show you an example here coronarius
[1:39:16] acts chapter 10 verse 44. stand there
[1:39:19] with me
[1:39:21] why peter yet speak these words peter
[1:39:23] was still preaching hallelujah
[1:39:25] peter was still talking like i'm talking
[1:39:27] right now and the holy ghost
[1:39:29] fell on all them which had the word the
[1:39:32] holy ghost
[1:39:34] it fell on them
[1:39:38] were they baptized that's my question
[1:39:40] but the political were they baptized
[1:39:43] yet were they baptized
[1:39:50] sister john tell us
[1:39:53] maybe you know this better these people
[1:39:54] may not know where these people baptize
[1:39:57] where is john is she's somewhere
[1:39:58] around there
[1:40:02] we're looking at acts chapter 10 where
[1:40:05] these people baptized
[1:40:06] yet or not
[1:40:13] we didn't hear your answer
[1:40:23] what whatever it is that you answered we
[1:40:26] need to hear
[1:40:27] brother peter mother peter where are
[1:40:30] these people baptized yet
[1:40:32] because the bible says that as peter was
[1:40:34] still speaking these words
[1:40:36] the holy ghost came on them so the
[1:40:38] question is were they baptized yet
[1:40:41] no they were not yet they were not
[1:40:44] yet baptized okay god bless you all
[1:40:47] right now
[1:40:47] if the holy ghost came on them and they
[1:40:49] will not get baptized
[1:40:51] now does it doesn't go against acts
[1:40:54] chapter 2
[1:40:55] the formula because the formula should
[1:40:58] be
[1:40:58] you you you you are baptized then you
[1:41:00] receive the holy ghost
[1:41:02] so my point i was trying to show you is
[1:41:05] baptism in itself doesn't give you the
[1:41:07] holy ghost
[1:41:08] what gives you the holy ghost is your
[1:41:10] faith in god
[1:41:12] and that faith comes by hearing the word
[1:41:14] the right word
[1:41:16] that is why before someone is baptized
[1:41:19] they must first
[1:41:20] hear they must first hear and they must
[1:41:23] believe
[1:41:25] after believing and only and only then
[1:41:28] can they be baptized
[1:41:30] if someone is baptized before believing
[1:41:34] they are not baptized rightly and they
[1:41:36] must get back in the water
[1:41:38] and be baptized in the right way so
[1:41:41] peter was still speaking and he was
[1:41:43] under the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:41:45] and he was speaking and the holy ghost
[1:41:47] came upon all of them
[1:41:50] which had what the word which had the
[1:41:53] word
[1:41:54] and the they of the circumcision which
[1:41:57] believed were astonished
[1:42:00] the brothers and sisters were astonished
[1:42:03] even the holy spirit can come on
[1:42:04] drunkards
[1:42:08] as many as came with peter because that
[1:42:10] on
[1:42:11] the gentiles also was powered out the
[1:42:13] gift of the holy ghost
[1:42:14] for they had them speak with the tanks
[1:42:17] and magnify
[1:42:18] god then answered peter
[1:42:22] hey peter was peter was challenged he
[1:42:24] said ah
[1:42:25] these people they had never seen it
[1:42:28] on any believers the holy ghost coming
[1:42:30] one day this is challenging
[1:42:32] it's quite challenging and what did
[1:42:34] peter do peter did what no disciple has
[1:42:37] ever done
[1:42:37] read your bible over and over again in
[1:42:40] the bible there is no one who has ever
[1:42:41] asked anyone to be baptized
[1:42:45] it was always the one who is hearing the
[1:42:47] gospel who asked
[1:42:49] can i be baptized please can you take me
[1:42:52] to be baptized
[1:42:53] there is no pastor in the bible who has
[1:42:55] ever asked anyone come i baptize you no
[1:42:58] one
[1:42:59] only apostle peter and
[1:43:02] peter has quite a character on him
[1:43:06] quite a nature you remember even on the
[1:43:08] day of pentecost
[1:43:09] it was him who told them but that
[1:43:21] was after they asked him
[1:43:24] can any man forbid water
[1:43:28] that this should also should not be
[1:43:30] baptized
[1:43:31] we shall receive the holy ghost as we
[1:43:33] have
[1:43:35] can anyone any man forbid water from
[1:43:38] them
[1:43:39] can any man say they shouldn't be
[1:43:40] baptized
[1:43:43] can anybody say they shouldn't be
[1:43:45] baptized
[1:43:46] can any sister say they shouldn't be
[1:43:48] baptized like us
[1:43:50] because they'll see the holy ghost like
[1:43:51] us
[1:43:53] then listen verse 48
[1:43:58] and he commanded them he did not request
[1:44:01] them he did not ask them he did not
[1:44:04] compel them he commanded everybody to
[1:44:07] say he commanded he commanded
[1:44:10] come on now you can serve much better
[1:44:12] than that
[1:44:14] he commanded them to be what
[1:44:18] never
[1:44:23] he commanded them to be baptized
[1:44:26] in the name of the lord then prayed him
[1:44:30] then they they asked him to wait for to
[1:44:32] be there for some days now listen
[1:44:34] friends paul told them oh you have
[1:44:36] received the holy ghost
[1:44:43] he told him hey wait wait wait come come
[1:44:47] here
[1:44:47] first get into this water i love that
[1:44:50] hallelujah
[1:44:52] oh man i just feel like preaching now he
[1:44:55] told them yes
[1:44:56] you are speaking tongues you are filled
[1:44:59] with the holy ghost
[1:45:00] you are anointed but come and get into
[1:45:02] the water
[1:45:03] we shall know by this whether you are
[1:45:05] believers or not you see
[1:45:08] so whether someone claims to have the
[1:45:10] holy ghost or not
[1:45:12] if they reject the word it is a clear
[1:45:14] sign they never had the holy ghost to
[1:45:15] begin with
[1:45:17] it's like
[1:45:27] a clear sign ghost
[1:45:30] and there are for my friends we must
[1:45:33] always taste every spirit
[1:45:36] and by the bottom gave us a good way of
[1:45:38] testing every spirit is by the word
[1:45:40] you give it a word test a word test when
[1:45:44] you give anything a wordy test
[1:45:46] then and only then can you know whether
[1:45:49] that thing
[1:45:50] is right with god whether that thing is
[1:45:52] of the holy ghost hallelujah
[1:45:54] now i'll give you a few quotes to
[1:45:57] confirm what i've been telling you
[1:45:59] and then i think i'll close with this
[1:46:01] because uh
[1:46:03] we have covered enough i think for today
[1:46:05] i think about four questions
[1:46:06] if you have not seen the first ones
[1:46:08] please you after the this you will just
[1:46:10] go back to youtube and watch it off if
[1:46:12] you want to share it with a friend
[1:46:14] you can go ahead and do that now and how
[1:46:17] can they claim to be a prophet now of
[1:46:19] course i'm reading from the way of a
[1:46:21] true prophet
[1:46:22] how can they claim to be a prophet of
[1:46:23] the lord and deny the very word of god
[1:46:25] how can a man baptize in the name of the
[1:46:27] father son and holy ghost them titles
[1:46:29] and deny the very name of jesus christ
[1:46:31] when it is not a scripture in the bible
[1:46:32] not to support their theory
[1:46:34] i may be hard and critical but it's the
[1:46:36] time to get that way
[1:46:38] it's the truth how can the people claim
[1:46:40] themselves to be christians today
[1:46:42] and running out here to everything and
[1:46:45] women and
[1:46:45] with bobby hair and wearing shorts and
[1:46:48] smoking cigarettes and running to
[1:46:50] uh the picture shows he means the movies
[1:46:52] there to everybody any kind of an old
[1:46:55] show and coming on
[1:46:56] tell me that that's the holy ghost tell
[1:46:58] me is that the holocaust
[1:47:01] am i talking to people or am i talking
[1:47:03] to no no
[1:47:06] don't you never tell me that you
[1:47:09] make god sick at his stomach if there
[1:47:12] was such a thing could be done
[1:47:14] yeah i'm sure you understand call
[1:47:15] yourself such as that how can there be
[1:47:17] such a thing
[1:47:18] but they are fruits you shall know them
[1:47:19] by their fruits you are now let me tell
[1:47:21] you even in these pentecostal churches
[1:47:26] which say they have the holy ghost with
[1:47:29] these things they are doing which grieve
[1:47:30] the holy ghost
[1:47:31] women in trousers in many clothes
[1:47:35] with all they are carrying on the way
[1:47:38] they were dressing in the nightclubs is
[1:47:40] the way they are dressing when they come
[1:47:41] in the church with their mini skirts
[1:47:43] with their lipsticks and they
[1:47:45] all they how many kilograms of of
[1:47:48] of painting on their face and everywhere
[1:47:50] you see you think god doesn't mind
[1:47:52] god minds about every word he puts in
[1:47:55] his bible
[1:47:56] and therefore they come in their
[1:47:57] churches and all these them
[1:47:59] a certified man of god why do they why
[1:48:02] do i call them 65 because they do
[1:48:04] not hold the word of god the way it is
[1:48:07] they hold it with the gloves
[1:48:08] you try to preach the bible calls them
[1:48:11] many pleasers
[1:48:13] you know and then they come in with
[1:48:15] their dances and they
[1:48:16] they pull the stops of the world and
[1:48:18] they begin dancing to please people you
[1:48:20] know
[1:48:20] worship these days is no longer
[1:48:22] worshipping the churches it is
[1:48:24] entertainment
[1:48:25] it is entertainment they are singing to
[1:48:27] entertainer
[1:48:28] to entertain and that kind of thing let
[1:48:31] me tell you even
[1:48:32] in the pentecostals a child of god
[1:48:34] filled with the holy ghost there cannot
[1:48:36] be happy with such a thing as that
[1:48:40] i was in hawasa i preached the message
[1:48:43] to a brother
[1:48:47] and this brother is the one who recorded
[1:48:49] those videos that you saw us posting
[1:48:52] and he was in this big big church
[1:48:54] prophetic church
[1:48:55] kind of called and he said he was
[1:48:58] this is his testimony he told me he was
[1:49:01] always telling them
[1:49:03] how can you claim that this is a church
[1:49:07] when you are doing what you are doing
[1:49:09] and this is a man
[1:49:10] who was before he received the christ he
[1:49:13] was going in a bar
[1:49:15] every night in these nightclubs he was
[1:49:18] all painted he has even the tattoos and
[1:49:19] everything
[1:49:20] on his body he has enjoyed life
[1:49:22] so-called
[1:49:24] so he came out from there and he said i
[1:49:27] was shocked
[1:49:28] when i came to the church the way the
[1:49:29] women who are being we're addressing
[1:49:31] there is the way they were dressing in
[1:49:33] the church
[1:49:33] and to make matters worse the same women
[1:49:36] that i would i would be
[1:49:38] i i was seeing that there are customers
[1:49:40] in the nightclubs because i know them
[1:49:42] i was there i was serving them they are
[1:49:44] the same women coming in the church and
[1:49:45] dressed the same way
[1:49:48] dancing the same dances so night clubs
[1:49:51] have become churches
[1:49:52] you see and they still claim to be tango
[1:49:55] talking
[1:49:56] and the demon chasing and having the
[1:49:57] holy ghost so judge by yourself
[1:50:00] is that the holy ghost no it is not
[1:50:04] that young a man he was among them his
[1:50:06] heart was not happy
[1:50:08] why because he was having the holy ghost
[1:50:11] even before being baptized in the name
[1:50:12] of our lord jesus christ
[1:50:14] and when he came to us the holy ghost
[1:50:16] let him look
[1:50:17] the bible says when he the spirit of
[1:50:19] truth shall come
[1:50:21] what will he do tell me somebody he said
[1:50:23] when he
[1:50:24] the spirit of truth shall come he will
[1:50:26] guide you
[1:50:28] into all truth
[1:50:31] so the holy ghost guided this brother
[1:50:34] he was hungering he was crying he was
[1:50:36] desiring for the holy ghost to come and
[1:50:38] speak to him
[1:50:39] but you see the holy ghost even led him
[1:50:42] to somebody that can give him the word
[1:50:45] hallelujah
[1:50:46] and when he received it he immediately
[1:50:49] told them i want to be baptized and we
[1:50:51] took him in the lake and he baptized him
[1:50:53] immediately
[1:50:54] he ran he went to his home he preached
[1:50:57] to his sister he preached to his mother
[1:50:58] they also came they said we wanted to
[1:51:02] and they are baptized what is it many of
[1:51:05] these
[1:51:06] were already filled with the holy ghost
[1:51:08] many of these were tank talking and
[1:51:09] demon chasing
[1:51:11] but they were among those churches which
[1:51:12] were not teaching the right truth
[1:51:15] so you see if you have the holy ghost
[1:51:19] no matter you can receive the holy ghost
[1:51:20] no matter where you are
[1:51:22] but the holy ghost is not sin because
[1:51:25] you're talking tongues
[1:51:26] the holy ghost is sin if you are bearing
[1:51:29] the feuds of the world
[1:51:31] that's how you you know that somebody's
[1:51:32] fueled the holy ghost
[1:51:34] if they bear the fruits of the world and
[1:51:37] and
[1:51:38] you cannot have the holy ghost and deny
[1:51:40] the truth
[1:51:42] never you can never die because the
[1:51:44] holocaust in you
[1:51:45] is that truth it's the same thing so how
[1:51:48] can he deny his own one
[1:51:49] can he he can't
[1:51:53] and and uh and then let me try to read
[1:51:55] this quote uh
[1:51:56] finish up this quote now this is another
[1:51:58] quote actually uh
[1:52:00] from the message uh god is provided away
[1:52:03] i'll read that and one more two quotes
[1:52:05] and then i i'm going to close with that
[1:52:07] i have to say this but i'm going to have
[1:52:09] to look
[1:52:12] and when you take women i'll i'll save
[1:52:14] it for one thing that's visible can see
[1:52:17] that claim to have the holy ghost and
[1:52:20] not decent enough to leave their hair
[1:52:22] grow can you imagine
[1:52:24] women claiming up the holy ghost and
[1:52:25] they're cutting their hair when the
[1:52:27] bible clearly states that
[1:52:28] if a sister cut or if a woman cuts her
[1:52:31] hair she shouldn't even come before the
[1:52:32] lord in prayer imagine
[1:52:34] very clear in the scriptures that she
[1:52:37] don't even listen enough to grow
[1:52:40] their hair there is something wrong
[1:52:42] somewhere a woman that will put on a
[1:52:43] garment that pertains to a man
[1:52:47] and wear it when the bible says it's an
[1:52:50] abomination to god
[1:52:51] for a woman to wear a garment pertains
[1:52:53] to a man and then you claim to have the
[1:52:55] holy ghost and do that
[1:53:00] he continues on actually that was from
[1:53:01] the message and i said shall possess the
[1:53:03] gate of their enemy
[1:53:04] i i joined it together here so i did not
[1:53:06] notice but then i'll continue here with
[1:53:07] god this provided way
[1:53:08] he says now remember you are just you
[1:53:11] are just
[1:53:12] accepted christ
[1:53:15] now god will give you the holy ghost in
[1:53:18] confirmation of your
[1:53:20] faith can everyone say that god will
[1:53:23] give you the holy ghost in confirmation
[1:53:25] of your
[1:53:26] faith you see it it's your faith that
[1:53:28] god gives you the holy ghost to
[1:53:30] on that basis now you get to some good
[1:53:33] full gospel church and be baptized right
[1:53:36] away you see
[1:53:37] after he is telling them after you've
[1:53:39] got the holy ghost
[1:53:41] according to your faith then run it away
[1:53:44] run and go
[1:53:44] and get baptized sometimes by the battle
[1:53:47] would say raise up your hands how many
[1:53:48] one they wanna go scare raise up your
[1:53:50] hand you pray for them
[1:53:51] they receive the holy ghost now run go
[1:53:53] to a church that baptizes
[1:53:54] in the right way in the name of our lord
[1:53:55] jesus christ and get baptized
[1:53:58] so you see it it is it's all the same
[1:54:01] thing
[1:54:03] and god is under obligation to give you
[1:54:05] the baptism of the holy ghost the moment
[1:54:06] you're baptized again it says
[1:54:08] well now the moment you are baptized god
[1:54:10] is under obligation to give you the holy
[1:54:12] ghost
[1:54:19] you cannot receive the holy ghost unless
[1:54:22] you
[1:54:22] are you are his and what confirms you
[1:54:25] that you are his is when you have a
[1:54:27] praise in his name
[1:54:28] and then now you can you can demand for
[1:54:31] it you can ask for it because then it is
[1:54:33] yours
[1:54:34] because it is a promise but even then it
[1:54:36] is him who gives he can give it to you
[1:54:38] at
[1:54:38] any time as long as you believe and have
[1:54:39] faith enough to receive it
[1:54:41] and and is under obligation to give it
[1:54:43] to you once you're baptized
[1:54:45] if you come with a true heart believing
[1:54:47] peter said just repent and be baptized
[1:54:49] and he shall receive the gift of the
[1:54:50] holy ghost
[1:54:51] god promised it now he would make
[1:54:53] everything
[1:54:54] right praise the name of the lord amen
[1:54:58] hallelujah so saints
[1:55:01] god still gives people the holy ghost
[1:55:03] and if you have baptized in a wrong way
[1:55:04] and we found out what are the wrong ways
[1:55:07] when you were
[1:55:08] if you were forced if you were asked
[1:55:11] if you were coerced into it and it
[1:55:14] wasn't your decision
[1:55:16] it wasn't your decision you did not know
[1:55:18] what you believed you never repented of
[1:55:20] your
[1:55:20] sins then you need to do it the right
[1:55:23] way that's what
[1:55:24] we have seen and found out in the
[1:55:25] scripture and i think i've answered all
[1:55:27] the other questions with that one
[1:55:29] that's how the first one was saying uh
[1:55:31] can you receive the holy ghost before
[1:55:32] baptism
[1:55:33] yes sure you can but if you have the
[1:55:35] true holy ghost
[1:55:36] then that word was must push you to go
[1:55:39] and be baptized
[1:55:40] in the in the right way in the name of
[1:55:42] our lord jesus christ
[1:55:43] praise the lord then then the other
[1:55:45] question was saying what
[1:55:47] i was saying what i want to try it or or
[1:55:50] just to give a basic answer
[1:55:52] for each of them then the other question
[1:55:54] was saying how
[1:55:55] does the word goes to get to you the oil
[1:55:57] goes against you as soon as you have
[1:55:59] faith and how does he come
[1:56:01] he can come in any way he chooses to but
[1:56:03] you see the way
[1:56:04] when he comes in your heart you do not
[1:56:06] say yeah that's the holy ghost
[1:56:08] all right but because i shouted you know
[1:56:11] he comes in and how
[1:56:12] you know when the child is being born
[1:56:14] does anyone see that ah
[1:56:16] there it is the life is coming the life
[1:56:18] is coming
[1:56:20] right there it has come it has now come
[1:56:23] in do you really see it
[1:56:24] you don't get to see the life coming but
[1:56:26] you know you only see the reaction of
[1:56:28] the life after just come
[1:56:30] so you see someone can shout dance be
[1:56:32] happy
[1:56:33] feel joy of the lord and all that kind
[1:56:34] of thing or think that it must happen
[1:56:36] it should happen to someone who has
[1:56:37] received life but you see that comes
[1:56:40] only because
[1:56:41] you have received the life but also we
[1:56:43] know the devil can impersonate it really
[1:56:45] so we cannot put the holy ghost on their
[1:56:47] breasts because someone spoke
[1:56:49] in tongues or was happy or shouted and
[1:56:50] danced that then we know that they are
[1:56:52] filled no
[1:56:54] it must be that their life agrees with
[1:56:56] the word of god
[1:56:58] they have the fruit that they have and
[1:57:00] then the other question was saying and
[1:57:02] are there any other reason why we are
[1:57:04] immersed in water
[1:57:05] during the baptism apart from being for
[1:57:07] a good yes yes there are many reasons
[1:57:09] one it identifies you in the death and
[1:57:11] barrier of our lord jesus christ
[1:57:14] according to
[1:57:15] romans chapter six and then also uh
[1:57:18] it says for the remission of your sins
[1:57:20] you see
[1:57:21] you share your faith by your works and
[1:57:23] if you believe and have faith in god
[1:57:25] then your sins will be forgiven but you
[1:57:26] say how do you have faith in god
[1:57:29] how do you know you have faith in god by
[1:57:31] by by your works
[1:57:32] by your works you show your faith in god
[1:57:35] and when you're baptized in water the
[1:57:36] bible says your sins are forgiven
[1:57:38] are washed away by what not by the water
[1:57:40] but by the blood
[1:57:41] of our lord jesus christ by that action
[1:57:43] you have done because that action
[1:57:45] symbolizes when you're baptized in that
[1:57:47] name it is the name which has the power
[1:57:49] to connect you with the blood and then
[1:57:51] your sins are remitted or washed away
[1:57:53] then also
[1:57:56] the baptism uh indeed uh
[1:58:00] is a show of our faith and the bible
[1:58:02] says he that be
[1:58:04] is baptized shall be saved so yes
[1:58:06] baptism
[1:58:07] now that save us as an answer to a good
[1:58:10] question
