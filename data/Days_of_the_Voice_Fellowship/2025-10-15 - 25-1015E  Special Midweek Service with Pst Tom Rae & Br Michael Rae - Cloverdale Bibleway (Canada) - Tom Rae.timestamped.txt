[48:50] Thank you pastors for coming. God bless
[48:52] you.
[48:54] Amen. You know I told them I told
[48:56] brother Guma who's brother Guma
[49:00] very good friend of mine I told him look
[49:04] the pastors from Canada
[49:06] are sacrificing all all the to come all
[49:09] the way
[49:11] more than 27 hours
[49:15] of flight to just come here
[49:18] and so they have sacrifice on their
[49:21] part.
[49:22] I said if you pastors are also willing
[49:25] to sacrifice
[49:28] then I'm also willing to sacrifice. If
[49:31] you are willing to sacrifice and pay
[49:32] your transportation
[49:36] then I'm willing to sacrifice
[49:38] and take care of you.
[49:41] And so um I hope that all of you are
[49:45] happy
[49:47] and and we try to do our best in our
[49:49] little way.
[49:52] And um we are so happy to be with you
[49:58] and um also um 11 pastors from West
[50:01] Nile.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you so much. Men of God
[50:08] and 13 pastors from Tesso.
[50:12] Was I told another group was coming?
[50:14] Pastor Chance, was I told that another
[50:16] group was coming?
[50:18] Was there another group of pastors
[50:20] coming from Tessa?
[50:23] Two two more who who have joined. Okay.
[50:27] So that makes it 15. We really
[50:28] appreciate you.
[50:31] Thank you so much for coming all the
[50:32] way.
[50:34] The pastors from West Nile that is I've
[50:36] been there at pastor Nimong's place.
[50:39] It's almost Congo the other side of
[50:43] so God bless you so much making the
[50:45] effort to come
[50:48] you know we have been here in the
[50:49] morning and you know discussing with
[50:50] pastor Tom regarding the uh you know the
[50:53] work of translation and the printing of
[50:54] the message and the brothers we were
[50:56] speaking of their burden
[51:03] that was really very outstanding
[51:07] and uh we thank the Lord for
[51:10] for that moment.
[51:13] Also, I understand my pastor is here,
[51:14] brother.
[51:19] Where is he? Over there.
[51:22] God bless you so much, sir. Thank you
[51:23] for that.
[51:26] Amen. He knows how much um Cloal
[51:29] impacted my life and ministry.
[51:36] You know when I I I started I was very
[51:38] young.
[51:40] I believe the message at 15 years.
[51:44] I was preaching from when I was 13 years
[51:45] old.
[51:48] Then I believed the message three years
[51:49] later
[51:51] and and um um so then I started
[51:54] researching to try and find out are
[51:56] there believers of this message in the
[51:57] rest of the world
[52:01] because my mother had told me don't
[52:03] don't follow those people because they
[52:05] um believe they in a cult they believe a
[52:07] man called William Brown
[52:15] and find out it was not a cult.
[52:18] I found out they were not believing in
[52:20] brother
[52:24] but believing in Jesus Christ.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; And I tell you what, my mother also
[52:29] believed.
[52:32] I don't know if she's here.
[52:34] Oh, mom, stand please. God bless you.
[52:39] And she was baptized in the name of our
[52:40] Lord.
[52:43] And so I mean I wish I had the time I
[52:45] would go through the whole story but I
[52:46] don't
[52:48] and so um at at that very young age
[52:53] I had too many questions and I wanted to
[52:56] research and find out more
[52:58] that's when I came across Bible
[53:03] and um tried to contact brother Edis
[53:07] tried and for a while didn't work
[53:11] but after a while of
[53:13] you know, he responded to me and um the
[53:16] rest is history.
[53:18] That man, brother Ed, really mentored me
[53:23] and I am what I am today
[53:26] in the ministry because of that man's
[53:28] testimony
[53:31] and uh he recently went to be with the
[53:33] Lord
[53:36] and brother Tom has stood with him in
[53:39] the ministry for over 50 years.
[53:44] and and um you know ministered with him
[53:46] and
[53:48] and I really was watching all their
[53:50] services. Brother services, brother Tom
[53:53] over there
[53:56] and they always did youth camps
[54:00] and the youth camps was all about
[54:02] preaching the word.
[54:05] I was so much touched by that
[54:08] and that is why I you know failed to
[54:11] also start doing youth camp
[54:15] and on our very first youth camp here
[54:20] Michael was the main speaker
[54:22] oh my he really blessed us really
[54:26] and um you know we've done it faithfully
[54:29] every year
[54:32] it's been a blessing to the region
[54:35] And we are so honored today
[54:38] to have pastor Tom Ray here
[54:42] to to me and to the church here is a
[54:44] blessing
[54:46] and being that you know they have stood
[54:48] behind the work of translation the work
[54:50] of printing the message.
[54:54] I was telling with the pastors, we are
[54:56] currently actually working on the on the
[54:57] Bible in Kama as well.
[55:02] And these are the brothers that have
[55:04] stood behind that
[55:07] because their burden and vision is
[55:11] not to just you know make men think you
[55:14] know like support people
[55:20] to support this message to God.
[55:24] And that's my burden and
[55:28] they supported me in Ethiopia
[55:31] and now in Ethiopia we have thousands of
[55:33] believers.
[55:36] So it's my honor and privilege this
[55:39] evening
[55:43] to introduce to you Pastor Tom,
[55:46] brother Michael. They're going to
[55:48] minister to us this evening.
[55:51] You can see I'm already on tension
[55:52] because I don't want to take much more
[55:53] time.
[55:56] I want us to hear the word.
[55:59] How many expectants?
[56:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:04] &gt;&gt; I'd like us to stand on our feet at this
[56:05] time.
[56:07] We'll invite brother Michael
[56:10] uh who um uh will
[56:16] just talking. I said, "Well, you'll be a
[56:17] John the Baptist.
[56:21] And um he will invite his father.
[56:27] [Music]
[56:28] These brothers
[56:30] just love the message. I love them
[56:34] because they love the message
[56:36] and I love you because you love them. If
[56:40] it was not the message of brother,
[56:43] we would not all be here.
[56:46] We thank God for the message.
[56:49] Praise God.
[56:52] Let us sing onlyly believe

[58:56] Lord
[58:58] I
[59:03] heavenly father tonight
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Lord there's a reason why you your
[59:09] prophet sang this song so many times
[59:12] [Music]
[59:15] Lord because you loved this song
[59:18] and you drew near Lord
[59:21] because it brought an atmosphere that
[59:23] you so much enjoyed to be in.
[59:27] So, Lord, how appropriate to sing the
[59:29] song tonight,
[59:32] because there's a group of believers
[59:33] here, Lord
[59:35] that are inviting you and desiring
[59:38] that you would be in our midst here
[59:40] tonight.
[59:41] So, Lord, we're wanting to tell you, we
[59:43] are believers.
[59:46] We believe your word tonight.
[59:49] That's what we come to feed on.
[59:52] So Lord, would your presence so just
[59:54] blanket over even
[59:57] feed our hungry souls.
[1:00:00] That we could leave tonight.
[1:00:02] We would say, "I know that my God is
[1:00:07] present among you."
[1:00:09] Lord, that's all we desire.
[1:00:12] Whatever word you want to say, we just
[1:00:14] come like Mary, sit at your feet
[1:00:17] tonight.
[1:00:19] Speak your word in Jesus Christ.
[1:00:23] Amen.
[1:00:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:27] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; It's good to be back.

[1:00:54] &gt;&gt; I'm just so just so happy to see the
[1:00:56] brothers and the pastors that have come.
[1:01:00] We had just a special moment this this
[1:01:02] earlier today.
[1:01:05] Brother Tom and I went back to the
[1:01:06] hotel.
[1:01:10] It was hard to really put into words
[1:01:11] just what how you blessed us.
[1:01:16] [Music]
[1:01:18] You came all this way and you poured
[1:01:19] into us.
[1:01:23] I thank you from the depths of our
[1:01:25] heart.
[1:01:28] I I made the journey up to Kamoa and I
[1:01:32] know how long that is.
[1:01:36] And so I I can I just from my heart
[1:01:40] one of you that traveled from every
[1:01:41] distance,
[1:01:43] God bless you. God bless you.
[1:01:47] &gt;&gt; I think one brother said he said you
[1:01:49] know we brother Brandham said about you
[1:01:50] know coming to the jungles of Africa.
[1:01:55] It's a privilege
[1:01:58] and an honor
[1:02:00] to come here.
[1:02:02] I I just don't even know how to put it
[1:02:04] in.
[1:02:06] how special it is
[1:02:09] and it makes us feel so small.
[1:02:13] We are one body.
[1:02:16] One body.
[1:02:18] I'm so thankful I'm connected
[1:02:21] with people like you. Amen. Amen.
[1:02:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:26] &gt;&gt; So I'm not going to take too much time.
[1:02:30] I'm going to try. Is anybody Are we Are
[1:02:33] we okay? But Arguma the brothers are
[1:02:35] going to get it in Kamoja too. Are we
[1:02:38] okay?
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Let's have the interpretation in
[1:02:42] Karamong. Yeah.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; The Luganda brethren, we have sacrificed
[1:02:47] you tonight.
[1:02:51] Oh my
[1:02:55] buddy. All right. Well,
[1:02:59] may the Lord open up heaven and help
[1:03:01] everyone understand tonight.
[1:03:06] And we'll we'll try and go slower,
[1:03:11] &gt;&gt; but no promises.
[1:03:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; All right. Cuz I have some ground to
[1:03:17] cover
[1:03:20] very quickly.
[1:03:22] &gt;&gt; And just give brother Tom a little
[1:03:24] jumping board maybe.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn on to our Bibles.
[1:03:33] to Matthew 7.
[1:03:37] &gt;&gt; I know brother Tom will greet you from
[1:03:39] home.
[1:03:42] But in in Uganda, you greet each other
[1:03:45] twice.
[1:03:49] Greet one side, we greet the other.
[1:03:57] So I have to give you a double greeting
[1:03:58] from home.
[1:04:02] I'll greet you from one side and say,
[1:04:04] "Everybody back in Cloverdale, greet
[1:04:05] you.
[1:04:09] We love you. We're supporting you."
[1:04:13] And brother Tom's going to come and say
[1:04:15] the say the same words.
[1:04:19] &gt;&gt; And that'll just be the other side.
[1:04:23] Amen. Amen. Matthew 7
[1:04:28] and verse 14.
[1:04:36] Because straight is the gate,
[1:04:39] and narrow is the way.
[1:04:45] Way, which leadth unto life, and few
[1:04:47] there be that find it.
[1:04:55] It says, "Beware of false prophets which
[1:04:57] come to you in sheep's clothing, but
[1:04:59] inwardly they are ravening wolves."
[1:05:10] Jesus said, "Ye shall know them
[1:05:16] by their fruits."
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; Very critical scripture. very important
[1:05:21] scripture.
[1:05:24] &gt;&gt; He says, "Do men gather grapes of
[1:05:26] thorns?
[1:05:29] &gt;&gt; Do men gather grapes of thorns or
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; or figs of thistles?"
[1:05:41] He said in verse 18, "A good tree cannot
[1:05:43] bring forth evil,
[1:05:50] neither can a corrupt tree bring forth
[1:05:52] good fruit."
[1:05:58] Verse 20 says, "Then wherefore by their
[1:06:00] fruits,
[1:06:01] [Music]
[1:06:06] or if I could say it this way, by the
[1:06:08] life that is made manifest,
[1:06:15] ye shall know them."
[1:06:18] Amen. By their fruits, by what is
[1:06:20] manifested
[1:06:24] is proof on what's inside.
[1:06:28] Amen. Do you believe that? Amen. Amen.
[1:06:31] You may have your seats tonight. God
[1:06:32] bless you.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; You don't have to turn to it just for
[1:06:38] for time, but in Matthew 24.
[1:06:43] It says a very familiar scripture.
[1:06:46] For there shall arise false Christs and
[1:06:48] false prophets,
[1:06:51] and they shall
[1:06:53] shall show great signs and wonders.
[1:07:00] In that if it was possible,
[1:07:04] if it was possible,
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; they shall deceive the very elect.
[1:07:12] [Music]
[1:07:13] That's this day.
[1:07:16] We live in a very deceptive age.
[1:07:22] I don't know about Uganda, but back home
[1:07:24] we get a lot of actually I have got them
[1:07:26] while I'm still here. So,
[1:07:32] do you get a lot of texts to your phone
[1:07:34] that are just scams?

[1:07:42] into something.

[1:08:10] There's something you need and you know
[1:08:11] on the other side of it it's not true.
[1:08:18] But they try and make it look so
[1:08:21] correct.
[1:08:23] [Music]
[1:08:27] They're trying to deceive you.
[1:08:33] To draw you in.
[1:08:36] They say, "Hey, our fruit is good."
[1:08:42] [Music]
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; You know, they just want you to click
[1:08:44] the link.
[1:08:48] But unfortunately,
[1:08:50] those that have clicked the links,
[1:08:54] they find out that the fruit's terrible,
[1:08:59] [Music]
[1:09:00] they go to their bank account
[1:09:04] and they find out the money's all gone.

[1:09:39] to somehow improve
[1:09:42] your life in some way.

[1:10:12] that you could produce something better.
[1:10:16] But you know what happens too often is
[1:10:18] that it just never produces the fruit
[1:10:20] you're looking for.
[1:10:27] And I don't think we've been in a in in
[1:10:29] a we're in the most critical time
[1:10:47] where God's people
[1:10:50] need to be so full of discernment.
[1:10:53] [Music]
[1:10:57] to know the intent,
[1:11:01] to know the spirit behind,
[1:11:06] to know the motive,
[1:11:10] the objective.
[1:11:13] We need to be able to see through.
[1:11:16] [Music]
[1:11:18] But to be able to see through,
[1:11:22] you need to have eyes that can see.
[1:11:27] Because on your own,
[1:11:30] you can't discern
[1:11:34] the deception of this age. Because
[1:11:35] scripture says,
[1:11:39] "If it were possible,
[1:11:42] it would deceive the elect."
[1:11:45] But something the elect has
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; there's a difference between
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; that gives you
[1:11:56] the ability
[1:11:58] to discern
[1:12:00] whether it's false
[1:12:03] or whether it's true.
[1:12:06] And without those eyes
[1:12:09] of this word,
[1:12:12] &gt;&gt; you will be deceived.
[1:12:18] Period.
[1:12:21] Period.
[1:12:22] There's no there's no middle ground.
[1:12:27] You're either deceived
[1:12:29] or you're not deceived.
[1:12:32] You either have something.
[1:12:34] You either have eyesight
[1:12:36] or you don't.
[1:12:38] There's not 18 flavors of eyesight.
[1:12:42] There's one eye.
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; That's God's eye
[1:12:47] given through a prophet
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; to give you the ability
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; to see the deception
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; and to see truth.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; It sounds like we're on the same page.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says,
[1:13:06] &gt;&gt; he says the two spirits will be real
[1:13:10] close together.
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:17] He said it will be closer
[1:13:21] at this end time. He says,
[1:13:28] think about this. At this last day,
[1:13:33] it will be so real.
[1:13:36] The spirit, the anointing of the age
[1:13:41] [Music]
[1:13:42] could be so close.
[1:13:45] You could walk into a church down the
[1:13:47] street
[1:13:49] and the anointing of the agent could be
[1:13:51] so close
[1:13:54] that it could deceive the elect.
[1:14:00] He said, "Brother Brando says, now how
[1:14:02] do you go?
[1:14:05] How how do we tell it in them days?
[1:14:09] [Music]
[1:14:12] How you're going to tell the difference
[1:14:14] today?"
[1:14:18] He says, "The same way.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word.
[1:14:28] It's not It's not complicated. It's not
[1:14:31] complicated.
[1:14:34] Stay with the word.
[1:14:38] That's why a prophet would come in this
[1:14:39] hour.
[1:14:42] Not pointing you to some other man or
[1:14:44] some other idea.
[1:14:46] But you know it's a true prophet when he
[1:14:49] points you always back to the word.
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; So, we're dead. We're It's no secret.
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; It's that we're in a very unique age.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; And I and I I mentioned this to the the
[1:15:08] people back home.
[1:15:11] [Music]
[1:15:12] If you've read the message, sir, is this
[1:15:14] the time?
[1:15:16] [Music]
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; You would you would see how brother
[1:15:19] Brandon was kind of probing. He could
[1:15:21] see that something was changing.
[1:15:23] Something was coming to to be ahead of
[1:15:25] him.
[1:15:27] [Music]
[1:15:32] And I feel I told the people back home,
[1:15:34] I feel like we're almost at that type of
[1:15:36] place right now
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:41] that something just lays just ahead of
[1:15:44] us.
[1:15:47] And when brother brother
[1:15:50] mentioned brother Bisco passing away
[1:15:55] [Music]
[1:15:58] brother Bisco preached the message like
[1:16:00] nobody else.
[1:16:04] If I can say bloodisco stayed with the
[1:16:06] word
[1:16:11] and that was very vital because all
[1:16:13] through the ages
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:18] every time people got off the word
[1:16:22] they would fall into sin.
[1:16:26] And you can go back through the judges
[1:16:29] and you can see with Ehood and Shamgar
[1:16:31] and Deborah,
[1:16:34] Gideon or Samson,
[1:16:37] God would bring and raise up somebody to
[1:16:39] point them back to the word.
[1:16:43] But then there would be these in between
[1:16:45] times and they'd fall away.
[1:16:49] And then I think about either Peter,
[1:16:51] James, and John.
[1:16:52] [Music]
[1:16:55] You know, imagine those days if you
[1:16:57] could talk with Peter.
[1:17:00] &gt;&gt; You say, "Peter,
[1:17:02] what was it like to to sit with Jesus?"
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; John,
[1:17:09] what was it like to to lay on his bosom
[1:17:11] and speak to him?
[1:17:17] And John would say, "Gather around."
[1:17:21] I want to tell you a little bit about
[1:17:22] what it was like.
[1:17:25] And he sit down and he start to tell
[1:17:26] them
[1:17:30] when we were at the last supper.
[1:17:35] And he started to tell us
[1:17:38] and during that time, that precious
[1:17:40] moment, he says, "I'm going to send you
[1:17:41] a comforter.
[1:17:46] &gt;&gt; I need to go, but I'm going to send you
[1:17:47] a comforter.
[1:17:50] I'm not going to leave you or forsake
[1:17:51] you. And he started to minister. Oh,
[1:17:54] John, what was that like? Oh my.
[1:17:59] The atmosphere was,
[1:18:01] how could I even express it?
[1:18:05] But you know what happened?
[1:18:08] John passed away.
[1:18:11] Peter passed away.
[1:18:14] Paul passed away.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; What now? What
[1:18:19] what do we do?
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; The these ones that you know that were
[1:18:23] that were here but now now they're gone.
[1:18:24] What what now? Who's going to lead us?
[1:18:26] Who's going to guide us?
[1:18:28] [Music]
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; I just wonder even in this hour
[1:18:37] [Music]
[1:18:40] at that time not when all that all
[1:18:43] passed away that had been there with
[1:18:44] Christ.
[1:18:50] What now?
[1:18:52] When all passes away that was been with
[1:18:54] the prophet
[1:18:58] when all the witnesses that were here
[1:18:59] when brother Brandham was here have all
[1:19:01] passed away. What happened?
[1:19:05] [Music]
[1:19:07] What do we do?
[1:19:09] You know we can't go we can't but is not
[1:19:11] going to speak and talk about when he
[1:19:13] was there on the log. What now?
[1:19:20] Do you think God was ever concerned?
[1:19:35] &gt;&gt; God was never concerned.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; God's never been worried
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; that his life would not continue forth.
[1:19:45] God's never been nervous,
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; whether his seed would continue onward.
[1:19:53] If there was a Samson
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; or an Ehood or a Shamgar or a Peter or a
[1:20:00] Paul or a or an Iranius
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; or a brother Brandham or a brother
[1:20:06] Biscll
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; or a you
[1:20:10] [Applause]
[1:20:12] God's never been wondering.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:19] Brother Brandham says, "Every spoken
[1:20:22] word of God is a seed."
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; And so all those men through the ages
[1:20:32] spoke God's word
[1:20:35] as a seed
[1:20:37] that would be deposited into his people
[1:20:41] because God knew who would receive it.
[1:20:45] And so when a prophet spoke
[1:20:48] and the word was dropped into their soul
[1:20:52] and they responded,
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; it brought life.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:01] &gt;&gt; Moses spoke seedword
[1:21:06] and it launched in the hearts of Israel
[1:21:09] [Music]
[1:21:10] which put Israel into action.
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:15] They put the blood on the doorpost.
[1:21:18] &gt;&gt; They went and got a lamb from the
[1:21:19] backyard.
[1:21:21] They followed the word of the hour.
[1:21:24] [Music]
[1:21:26] It wasn't just in the mind.
[1:21:29] It wasn't just in the thoughts.
[1:21:31] But it was action life.
[1:21:34] They lived it.
[1:21:36] [Music]
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; What did it produce?
[1:21:42] It produced a power
[1:21:44] &gt;&gt; by following the word
[1:21:47] that put power in a blood that could put
[1:21:50] the on the doorpost of their home and
[1:21:53] would stave off. It would hold back
[1:21:57] death in the hour. It's the same in this
[1:22:00] hour.
[1:22:01] The same word
[1:22:04] has been spoken
[1:22:06] and you need to live it. Cuz in the
[1:22:09] living of it, it puts blood across your
[1:22:13] doorpost
[1:22:15] to stop death in this hour.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; But Brandham said,
[1:22:28] &gt;&gt; speaking about a child that was needing
[1:22:29] to be healed,
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; she was going to die from cancer. I
[1:22:36] believe it was.
[1:22:38] And he said, "I never touched the
[1:22:41] child."
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:44] He said, "I just went to the pulpit."
[1:22:48] He just came to the pulpit
[1:22:50] with the word.
[1:22:53] He said, "And the word
[1:22:56] healed her so instantly
[1:22:59] until she got up
[1:23:02] and walked away."
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Why? Because there's power
[1:23:08] in the word.
[1:23:10] That's where it lies. Stay with the
[1:23:13] word.
[1:23:16] He said the word went forth.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; She believed the word. The word is God's
[1:23:21] life.
[1:23:22] and God's power and what and the word is
[1:23:26] what it does. It heals the sick.
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:33] &gt;&gt; Elijah
[1:23:35] was God's word in that hour,
[1:23:39] held on to that word
[1:23:41] that Elijah spoke and out from that came
[1:23:45] life.
[1:23:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:48] Out of Elijah
[1:23:50] came the word and raised a dead boy to
[1:23:54] life.
[1:23:55] [Applause]
[1:23:56] Samuel had the word
[1:23:59] and brought a nation to life.
[1:24:02] Puted David on a throne.
[1:24:06] Jeremiah had the word.
[1:24:09] Preached a warning
[1:24:11] and said, "Repent.
[1:24:14] Get back to the word of God.
[1:24:18] to try to keep a people
[1:24:21] from destruction.
[1:24:24] But over and over and over,
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:29] the words rejected.
[1:24:31] Rejected.
[1:24:33] Rejected.
[1:24:35] Samuel's word was discounted and set
[1:24:37] aside.
[1:24:38] [Music]
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; And they put a Saul on the throne.
[1:24:44] Jeremiah was scorned and thrown aside.
[1:24:49] &gt;&gt; Elijah was rejected at Mount Carmel.
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; But I'll ask you,
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; did it stop the life?
[1:25:01] [Music]
[1:25:02] Did it ever stop the life moving
[1:25:04] through?
[1:25:07] It can't ever stop
[1:25:12] because even there was Elijah
[1:25:16] down in the dumps after Mount Carmel.
[1:25:20] But oh God,
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; it's just me.
[1:25:24] I just need to go. Take me off the
[1:25:26] scene.
[1:25:28] It's It's over. No one else believes
[1:25:30] this word.
[1:25:31] Are we the only church in Uganda? Am I
[1:25:35] the only believer in my village?
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; Oh, God.
[1:25:40] No. God said Elijah.
[1:25:44] You might feel alone.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; You might feel alone in Karamoja.
[1:25:50] You might feel alone here in Uganda.
[1:25:53] You might feel alone up by the West
[1:25:55] Nile.
[1:25:56] But God's here telling you tonight,
[1:26:00] I've got 7,000.
[1:26:02] I've got some other ones set aside.
[1:26:05] &gt;&gt; I got believers there in Cloverdale,
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; in Europe, in China,
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; all through Africa
[1:26:15] I've reserved unto me. My bride
[1:26:20] because my life has been deposited.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. You're not alone, Elijah. You're
[1:26:28] not alone.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a few more.
[1:26:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why? Because Jesus.
[1:26:39] [Music]
[1:26:41] &gt;&gt; The lifegiver himself.
[1:26:45] He said, "I am the bread of life.
[1:26:51] He that cometh to me
[1:26:54] shall never hunger.
[1:26:56] He that believeth on me shall never
[1:26:58] thirst."
[1:27:00] Can you imagine standing there
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; listening to those words?
[1:27:07] &gt;&gt; Oh my.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; You think you'd just be like, "Well, I'd
[1:27:10] be just be revelated right there."
[1:27:15] &gt;&gt; Yeah. But if you go back to the
[1:27:16] scripture, some people heard that
[1:27:21] and in that same chapter,
[1:27:25] God breaks the natural bread and
[1:27:27] multiplies it.
[1:27:32] before their very eyes. He broke the
[1:27:34] bread
[1:27:37] and fed 5,000 people.
[1:27:41] He says, "I am the bread of life."
[1:27:45] And the creator is breaking the bread,
[1:27:47] showing them, vindicating behind it that
[1:27:51] I am the creator.
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; I'm the bread.
[1:27:55] &gt;&gt; I'm the one that can sustain you.
[1:27:58] [Music]
[1:27:58] [Applause]
[1:28:00] But many of them said, "Well, give us a
[1:28:02] sign."
[1:28:03] [Music]
[1:28:05] He'd already given them a sign.
[1:28:09] And he continued through John 6, if you
[1:28:11] want to read it
[1:28:12] [Music]
[1:28:14] at some other moment.
[1:28:17] He continues to say through that chapter
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:21] that he is he go he says, "I am the
[1:28:23] bread of life in 48.
[1:28:27] I'm the living I'm the living bread that
[1:28:30] came down from heaven.
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:33] If any man eat of this bread,
[1:28:37] if any man eat of this bread,
[1:28:40] he was trying to get them to see
[1:28:41] something different.
[1:28:43] Not the barley bread in front of you,
[1:28:46] not the little flat bread in front of
[1:28:48] you. But me, him, he was the word. If
[1:28:53] you can partake of my word,
[1:28:56] you will have life.
[1:28:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you, what did it do to
[1:29:01] those that caught it?
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; What did it do to those that grabbed a
[1:29:06] hold of that?
[1:29:08] [Applause]
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Just a minority.
[1:29:11] Just very, very, very few.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; But God don't care how many few.
[1:29:20] All he cares is that the life continues.
[1:29:25] [Music]
[1:29:28] Amen. It just needs to continue.
[1:29:32] And the word
[1:29:34] ignited
[1:29:36] and birthed sons and daughters
[1:29:42] in the early church.
[1:29:45] Can you imagine?
[1:29:49] One man said, "The twel apostles
[1:29:54] were just ordinary men."
[1:29:59] &gt;&gt; He says, "But Jesus,
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; the word
[1:30:04] formed them into the backbone of the
[1:30:07] church."
[1:30:11] Amen. Why? Why did they have such
[1:30:14] backbone?
[1:30:17] Not because it was something of the
[1:30:18] mind,
[1:30:20] not some idea that, "Oh, those sound
[1:30:22] like good words. Those sound like good
[1:30:24] words.
[1:30:26] It was more than good words.
[1:30:29] More than just a, oh, that's a lovely
[1:30:30] doctrine."
[1:30:34] No, it's more than that.
[1:30:36] It was a word that was deposited
[1:30:40] into a predestinated seed.
[1:30:44] Amen. igniting inside of them.
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; A life.
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; I'll tell you what kind of life it was.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; If it was just man's life,
[1:31:00] Peter would have not walked to a cross
[1:31:04] and said, "I'm not even worthy to be
[1:31:05] crucified like my Lord.
[1:31:11] You can kill me, but upside down.
[1:31:15] You think that was just natural life
[1:31:19] that Andrew,
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; John or sorry not John, Andrew, James,
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; Thomas,
[1:31:28] Matthew,
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; Philillip, Bartholomew,
[1:31:33] all of these disciples
[1:31:37] because they had partaken of the word.
[1:31:42] It didn't matter the circumstance.
[1:31:46] It didn't matter how difficult life was.
[1:31:50] Didn't matter how difficult and poor you
[1:31:52] are.
[1:31:53] The situations you're in.
[1:31:56] Peter was looking at a cross.
[1:31:59] They were looking at spears.
[1:32:01] They were looking at lions.
[1:32:04] They're looking at a burning stake.
[1:32:07] But something inside
[1:32:09] that had a life of its own. was the word
[1:32:13] that was placed inside of them. It
[1:32:16] didn't matter what came.
[1:32:19] It don't matter what comes
[1:32:22] if you have this word, this message.
[1:32:26] Why do you think we're so passionate
[1:32:28] about the message? Because if that's
[1:32:30] inside of you,
[1:32:33] it don't matter what Leoa can give you.
[1:32:36] I don't care how dark it is.
[1:32:39] You young people, I don't care how bad
[1:32:41] your school is.
[1:32:43] With this word, this life,
[1:32:46] you can run through the troop.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; You can leap over the wall.
[1:32:51] &gt;&gt; You can walk through and say,
[1:32:52] "Hallelujah."
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:04] &gt;&gt; Did it end at Peter?
[1:33:08] All the disciples are gone now.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:33:15] no. Cuz the word, the bread of life,
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; doesn't rely on you and me.
[1:33:25] It's not dependent upon our ability.
[1:33:28] [Music]
[1:33:31] You aren't having to try and figure out
[1:33:32] how to well, how do I live this life?
[1:33:34] It's so difficult. He doesn't rely on
[1:33:36] your ability.
[1:33:40] I just don't know if I can. You can't.
[1:33:45] He can.
[1:33:46] You I I can't do it by my merit.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a good boy. I've been raised in
[1:33:53] the church.
[1:33:55] Good for you. You're still a wretched
[1:33:57] sinner
[1:34:01] because your life is nothing.
[1:34:04] But his life is everything.
[1:34:07] You better not be dependent upon your
[1:34:09] church. You can't be dependent upon just
[1:34:12] somebody or mom and daddy beside you.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; Well, they're a good mom and dad, so
[1:34:16] I'll just go on that.
[1:34:20] You need your own life.
[1:34:24] Brother Brandham said, Brother Brandham
[1:34:26] says we rely
[1:34:31] upon him.
[1:34:36] I'm quoting,
[1:34:38] not upon culture,
[1:34:41] not upon education,
[1:34:44] not upon the things of this world.
[1:34:47] Scripture says, not by power,
[1:34:50] not by might, but by my spirit, sayeth
[1:34:54] the Lord.
[1:34:57] So then if you can't do it
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; and I can't do it and I can't stand
[1:35:02] against the darkness,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; you can't stand against the darkness,
[1:35:06] then what does God have to do?
[1:35:09] What does he need to do
[1:35:12] to ensure that there's a bride in this
[1:35:14] age?
[1:35:17] He has to deposit his life into you and
[1:35:21] into me.
[1:35:24] And how will he do that?
[1:35:27] Through an Elijah.
[1:35:31] Because the word comes through a prophet
[1:35:34] and the prophet brings it to the people.
[1:35:36] And if you believe the words of a
[1:35:38] prophet,
[1:35:40] you are certain to have life.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:49] He said
[1:35:52] &gt;&gt; he will be the strength of him.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit will be the strength of
[1:35:58] him.
[1:36:00] Not his theological background,
[1:36:03] not his denomination,
[1:36:05] but the Holy Ghost will be his strength.
[1:36:09] [Music]
[1:36:11] He'll rely upon the strength of the Holy
[1:36:14] Spirit to turn the alien away.
[1:36:18] He says don't rely upon no speaking in
[1:36:20] tongues.
[1:36:23] He says but let the token itself be
[1:36:26] there.
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:31] &gt;&gt; Like I said earlier
[1:36:35] God like I said
[1:36:39] has never bit his nails
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; nervously. Oh dear goodness.
[1:36:48] you know, am I going to have a bride out
[1:36:51] of Leodysia?
[1:36:55] You know, is there actually going to be
[1:36:56] somebody there at the end time?
[1:37:00] Can can they really take the heat?
[1:37:06] Amen. Oh, Lord. as it came to maybe it's
[1:37:10] the seven church ages through the ages
[1:37:11] of time
[1:37:15] and he looked at the Catholic Church.
[1:37:19] He says, "Oh my goodness.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Oh my, that's a really big foe right
[1:37:23] there. Can Martin Luther stand against
[1:37:26] it? You know, have I have I done enough
[1:37:29] to make sure Luther can stand at the
[1:37:31] door?"
[1:37:35] You know, wait, was God wiping his brow?
[1:37:38] Oh dear.
[1:37:40] Is Is Martin Luther going to make it?
[1:37:43] No. God never wiped his brow.
[1:37:47] God stood there
[1:37:50] waiting because he knew that Luther
[1:37:53] already had inside of him. And when the
[1:37:56] word activated at that hour,
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Martin Luther could walk to the gate and
[1:38:03] hammer the door.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And say, "I stand against the Catholic
[1:38:07] Church.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; This just, the just
[1:38:11] shall live by faith.
[1:38:16] In God wasn't wiping his brow.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; He was saying, "Well, look there.
[1:38:24] That's my boy.
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; That's my son.
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; That's my daughter.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Look at them.
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; Watch them stand in this age.
[1:38:36] &gt;&gt; Oh, he must have a little jubilee in
[1:38:37] heaven. When he watches you as you
[1:38:41] partake of the word, he watch you
[1:38:43] translators, as you scribble out the
[1:38:46] message,
[1:38:48] God starts to jump up and down to glory
[1:38:51] to God.
[1:38:54] My life has been activated.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:09] &gt;&gt; I'm just going to stop cold turkey here
[1:39:11] pretty quick and then it's over to you,
[1:39:12] Dad.
[1:39:15] [Music]
[1:39:20] So, brother Brandham says, "Your name is
[1:39:24] Simon. You're the son of Jonas."
[1:39:28] Speaking to Peter,
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; he says, "Who did he prove it to?"
[1:39:34] He says, "Why didn't he prove that word
[1:39:37] to Caiaphas?"
[1:39:43] But Ram says, "He was God.
[1:39:46] He knew Caiaphas would never believe it.
[1:39:53] [Music]
[1:39:55] But Peter
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; was ordained to life
[1:40:02] and God knew it.
[1:40:05] So he couldn't reveal it to Caiaphas
[1:40:09] because he wasn't ordained to it.
[1:40:12] But you
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; who are ordained to it.
[1:40:17] [Applause]
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; You say, "Wow, brother Michael, I just
[1:40:21] don't really feel the joy and the peace
[1:40:22] and the patience.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; I've never had a dream or I've never
[1:40:27] spoke in tongues.
[1:40:31] I'm going to read a quote for you."
[1:40:35] But Brandham says, "Oh, this is why the
[1:40:38] word is so important in this hour.
[1:40:43] Somebody gets a thought in their mind
[1:40:46] of what they feel the manifestation of
[1:40:47] God is
[1:40:50] and they go off this way
[1:40:52] and confuse so many people.
[1:40:55] But a prophet comes in this hour
[1:40:59] and says, "What is the fruit of the
[1:41:00] spirit?"
[1:41:03] The manifestation
[1:41:05] of the promised word.
[1:41:12] like, "Oh, it's it's uh it's not me
[1:41:14] jumping and shouting
[1:41:20] &gt;&gt; cuz brother brother Brandon was talking
[1:41:21] about Jesus
[1:41:23] [Music]
[1:41:24] and he was there with the whip and he
[1:41:26] was clearing out everything.
[1:41:30] Brother Brandon pointed to all the good
[1:41:32] rabbis
[1:41:34] [Music]
[1:41:36] and a good rabbi
[1:41:39] Good rabbi
[1:41:42] never said a bad thing in his life.
[1:41:46] The best of the best.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; My dear child, how can I help you today?
[1:41:55] Meanwhile, Jesus the word
[1:41:59] is clearing out the temple.
[1:42:02] &gt;&gt; Oh, he's violent.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Well, I mean, he's destroying
[1:42:07] everything.
[1:42:09] How can we believe that?
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; But he was revealing and manifesting the
[1:42:14] word in his hour.
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; He was the word in the hour.
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; And so people get so confused sometimes
[1:42:25] because they're missing actually the
[1:42:27] revealing of God in that hour.
[1:42:32] says, "Unless you accept the word of the
[1:42:34] hour
[1:42:36] when it's manifested before you,
[1:42:40] you're in you're in the same
[1:42:42] predicament."
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; But Abraham says, "You can't rely on the
[1:42:50] shouting and this the tongues and all of
[1:42:51] this.
[1:43:00] The token is the word identified in you
[1:43:13] living itself
[1:43:15] out
[1:43:21] by their fruits.
[1:43:25] Know them.
[1:43:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; That's why in this hour when things get
[1:43:33] so deceived, just look at the fruits.
[1:43:39] Look at the life that's lived
[1:43:45] and in this in this hour
[1:43:48] in this age when every there's when the
[1:43:51] false and every demon
[1:43:56] it's the hour I could say of
[1:43:57] manifestation of both evil
[1:44:04] Darkness is is is pressing itself,
[1:44:12] but so is the hour for the wheat
[1:44:21] to be on full display.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:35] If there's ever an hour
[1:44:39] when seeds are going to manifest,
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; it's now.
[1:44:48] Don't you be surprised.
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; Judas
[1:44:54] manifested
[1:44:56] who he was
[1:44:59] right at the cross.
[1:45:03] He held on all the way.
[1:45:08] But when the word was now to completely
[1:45:11] come to full effect,
[1:45:19] everyone manifested who they were.
[1:45:25] So don't be surprised when it's like,
[1:45:26] "Oh my goodness, what are they doing?
[1:45:29] How did they how could they make that
[1:45:30] decision? or how could they go here?
[1:45:35] I don't understand it.
[1:45:39] Peter and James and John, Judas,
[1:45:47] how could this be?
[1:45:50] But the fruit
[1:45:53] now was manifesting.
[1:45:57] But so
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; is a John.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; So is a Peter.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; So is an Andrew.
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; It's a key. And here we are now. God's
[1:46:12] waiting. Can you
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Can you imagine
[1:46:17] if if God standing on the banisters of
[1:46:19] heaven looking down right now
[1:46:23] and he's been I've been waiting.
[1:46:27] He's waited all this time
[1:46:31] for the culmination
[1:46:35] of you.
[1:46:37] He's waited.
[1:46:40] He's excited
[1:46:43] to be able to prove
[1:46:46] to the word to the world I should say
[1:46:49] that his life
[1:46:51] that burst forth at Calvary
[1:46:55] to tear a bride out.
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; He's been waiting for you.
[1:47:01] Can you imagine how excited he must be
[1:47:05] to see Uganda believers?
[1:47:07] Catch the word.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, I've been waiting.
[1:47:12] I've been waiting for a kamoja.
[1:47:15] I've been waiting for the alert.
[1:47:18] I've been waiting for everybody in this
[1:47:20] world.
[1:47:22] He must do a little joy dance.
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; It's time.
[1:47:27] &gt;&gt; Angels,
[1:47:29] step aside.
[1:47:30] It's time. This is the hour that my life
[1:47:36] will vindicate
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; that my message.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Oh, is true
[1:47:43] all through the ages.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming.
[1:47:53] &gt;&gt; There's a rapture coming.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Oh, we've heard it before.
[1:47:58] Yeah. Yeah. That life isn't really real.
[1:48:00] But there's a people
[1:48:03] that the seed has moved through time.
[1:48:06] It stayed steadfast,
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; pure,
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; virgin to come to this hour.
[1:48:14] this age
[1:48:16] where you actually prove God's word
[1:48:18] correct,
[1:48:23] God is able to take you
[1:48:26] and stand you before the world
[1:48:29] and say, "My life
[1:48:32] has always
[1:48:34] and will always
[1:48:37] have power
[1:48:38] to bring my bride back to my side.
[1:48:45] Amen.
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; That's why Tamar,
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; you know Tamar? Yeah.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; That's why Tamar,
[1:48:56] &gt;&gt; you know the story of Tamar.
[1:49:00] Tamar
[1:49:01] had Judah's seed placed in her.
[1:49:08] You read that story
[1:49:11] like
[1:49:12] that's a pretty intense story.
[1:49:18] &gt;&gt; And Tamar,
[1:49:20] &gt;&gt; get over here, Tamar.
[1:49:23] You're a prostitute.
[1:49:26] Stand here.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; You're going to be stoned.
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; Burning.
[1:49:32] Tamar doing wasn't holding her head in.
[1:49:36] No, don't do it.
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't mean to.
[1:49:40] &gt;&gt; That wasn't Tamar.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Tamar walked with confidence.
[1:49:48] She stood there and she looked at
[1:49:50] everybody.
[1:49:53] As they're getting ready to light a
[1:49:54] fire,
[1:49:58] the heat around her started to get hot.
[1:50:02] The world is starting to get right in
[1:50:04] her face.
[1:50:09] Whose seat is this?
[1:50:13] And she brings out the signate
[1:50:17] and the staff
[1:50:20] to prove who it was.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; But you know why she could walk with
[1:50:26] confidence?
[1:50:30] because inside of her
[1:50:33] &gt;&gt; was Judah's life
[1:50:37] and she knew
[1:50:39] they couldn't touch her.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; If it was anybody else, she was dead.
[1:50:48] Anybody
[1:50:49] else, any other man, any other religion,
[1:50:55] any other hybrid idea,
[1:50:59] any other seed in the womb of your soul,
[1:51:05] you're dead.
[1:51:07] But Tamar
[1:51:09] held Judah's seed.
[1:51:12] And Tamar
[1:51:14] was then untouchable.
[1:51:18] You're untouchable
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; because you carry the life of the land
[1:51:23] of the tribe of Judah
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; by his word in this hour.
[1:51:28] &gt;&gt; You can walk confidently in this age.
[1:51:32] You can step forth in all darkness
[1:51:35] and you can say, "I know in whom I have
[1:51:38] believed and am persuaded."
[1:51:42] For he is able
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; to carry me through no matter how dark,
[1:51:47] no matter how difficult. Because this
[1:51:50] message,
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; this word of this hour
[1:51:54] has a life of its own to bring you and
[1:51:58] me to rapture.
[1:52:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:52:03] &gt;&gt; Stay with the word.
[1:52:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother Tom. Amen.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Pick up your sword. It's your turn to
[1:52:14] swing.
[1:52:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:17] &gt;&gt; Accept the challenge.
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; The seeds in you
[1:52:28] to meet the challenge
[1:52:30] &gt;&gt; of this age.
[1:52:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:52:34] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; God be with you.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. Hallelujah. God
[1:52:41] bless you.
[1:52:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:52:47] Praise God.
[1:52:48] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; You believe this? Did you believe this?
[1:52:57] &gt;&gt; We should be able to rejoice.
[1:53:01] When John saw his name in the book,
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; all in heaven,
[1:53:07] &gt;&gt; all under heaven,
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; he turn and say, "Glory,
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; Praise our King."
[1:53:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; You think we're excited?
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; We are a people of passion.
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; Passion.
[1:53:27] The Bible says that the God,
[1:53:31] &gt;&gt; the mighty God, the prince of peace,
[1:53:36] the counselor,
[1:53:39] he's still mighty.
[1:53:42] And the Bible says the zeal of the Lord
[1:53:46] was in him.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; So if it was in the father,
[1:53:50] &gt;&gt; it's in his seat.
[1:53:55] God has a zeal,
[1:53:57] &gt;&gt; the passion.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; So, we have a zeal tonight.
[1:54:12] It's not put on.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; It's a reality
[1:54:16] because it's not your life. It's God
[1:54:19] life in you.
[1:54:22] Who saved you? Who delivered you? Who
[1:54:26] brought this message by your way? God
[1:54:28] brought this message by your way.
[1:54:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:32] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said, "It was the
[1:54:34] resurrection
[1:54:36] coming to you."
[1:54:38] No different than Elohim coming to
[1:54:41] Abraham's.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; God coming to Abraham's death. God has
[1:54:47] come to your test.
[1:54:49] The resurrection has come to your test.
[1:54:52] zealous,
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; passionate,
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; glory,
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; I've got something worth shouting about.
[1:55:10] &gt;&gt; It makes me sing and it makes me shout.
[1:55:14] &gt;&gt; It's not me.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; It's God in me.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; It's not you. that is God in you.
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; Glory
[1:55:26] now.
[1:55:27] &gt;&gt; We are the sons of God.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; Not we will be.
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; But we are because of the life in the
[1:55:35] sea.
[1:55:38] Hallelujah.
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Oh my. Oh my.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:55:48] Michael got me all stimulated.
[1:55:52] Same life.
[1:55:54] Same life, brother Michael. Same life.
[1:55:58] Same life.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; It's got a life of its own. God life.
[1:56:06] Paul said, "It's no longer I that live,
[1:56:10] but Christ live in me."
[1:56:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Christ live in you.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; You don't have a little seed of God. You
[1:56:17] have God.
[1:56:21] He's He doesn't diminish
[1:56:24] by just coming to Uganda
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; and leaving Canada out of it.
[1:56:30] Leaving Canada bye-bye.
[1:56:35] God does not diminish.
[1:56:38] So what he does in Canada, what he does
[1:56:41] in America, he does in Uganda.
[1:56:46] Glory.
[1:56:48] He comes from the east, west, north,
[1:56:52] south.
[1:56:56] Hallelujah.
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; Only this message makes this Bible
[1:57:01] alive.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; Your children don't need a dead gospel.
[1:57:08] Your children need a living God living
[1:57:11] in you that they can see you.
[1:57:16] That's the kind of God I want.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; A God in flesh.
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; A God in flesh.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; A God in flesh.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; Let this mind.
[1:57:31] at this mind
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; that was in Christ be in you
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; who thought it was not robbery to become
[1:57:40] the sons of God.
[1:57:43] All creation groanth waiting for the
[1:57:46] manifestation
[1:57:50] this day. This scripture is being
[1:57:54] fulfilled
[1:57:57] now.
[1:57:58] We are the sons of God.
[1:58:02] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:58:05] This message is not another doctrine.
[1:58:11] Do you understand that?
[1:58:13] This message is not another doctrine.
[1:58:17] I cause another church.
[1:58:21] Church is in the building.
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; Church.
[1:58:26] Church. Church. Church.
[1:58:30] That's where God dwells. He dwells in
[1:58:33] your temple.
[1:58:35] Amen. When Michael was whipping, kicking
[1:58:38] over those benches in the temple, God
[1:58:42] came into your life,
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; took all unbelief,
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; whipped it out by the word of God.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Clean the temple out so that God
[1:58:51] can come down and live in your temple.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; It's not just for the young men. It's
[1:59:04] not for just young men.
[1:59:08] But the same life that's in the young,
[1:59:11] the same life that's in the old,
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; what can I say? The same life that was
[1:59:18] in the old is in the new.
[1:59:21] Glory. Amen. Amen. This revelation, this
[1:59:26] wine of stimulation.
[1:59:28] It's not a thought. It's the opening of
[1:59:31] the word.
[1:59:33] It's not the oil or the wine.
[1:59:37] Touch it not. Touch it not, devil.
[1:59:41] That's a stimulation
[1:59:43] from revelation. Take the book.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Take the book.
[1:59:49] Give me the book.
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; That's what I heard this morning. Give
[1:59:53] me the message.
[1:59:55] Take the message.
[1:59:58] And when that message came by our way,
[2:00:02] eat it.
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; And what you eat is what you want.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; You don't take a little theology of past
[2:00:11] years
[2:00:13] and use then this message theology.
[2:00:20] Every time that life went up to stock,
[2:00:25] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. No, we doing good.
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; Good. Yes. Okay.
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; Can you give me five more minutes?
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; So, as the life comes up, the sock
[2:00:37] stalk
[2:00:39] tassel
[2:00:41] shuck
[2:00:43] seat. So, as the life was going up, it
[2:00:47] was dying behind them.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; We don't want anything that was behind
[2:00:51] us. We want the cross before us. The
[2:00:54] world behind this.
[2:00:57] Give me this whole world. No. Give me
[2:01:00] Jesus.
[2:01:02] This message is Jesus Christ.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; He said, "Now when he comes down,
[2:01:14] &gt;&gt; I am his voice."
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't William Random.
[2:01:22] It was the microphone as we said this
[2:01:24] morning.
[2:01:26] Brother Brand was the microphone.
[2:01:29] That's why when he took the lady by the
[2:01:30] hand
[2:01:32] or discern their heart,
[2:01:35] he said whatever he said. Is that right?
[2:01:38] What was he doing? Removing himself and
[2:01:42] let it God come in and give him a
[2:01:45] temporal resurrection.
[2:01:47] Because it wasn't William Brham, it was
[2:01:49] the resurrection in William Brandom.
[2:01:53] &gt;&gt; You have to look around the room
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; and say, "It's not brother Michael or
[2:01:58] brother Charles,
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; brother Buzz. It's God himself
[2:02:04] living in the people once again. We're
[2:02:07] not in the stock. We're not in the
[2:02:09] tassel.
[2:02:10] We're not in a shock."
[2:02:12] As brother Michael said,
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; you'll know it by the fruit.
[2:02:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, this message is so wonderful.
[2:02:22] It's just really stimulating.
[2:02:26] You haven't got it yet.
[2:02:29] You might have it here,
[2:02:32] but let the Holy Spirit bring it.
[2:02:37] Hallelujah.
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; Remember when brother Brown
[2:02:40] he came into the meeting and came into
[2:02:42] the Pentecostals
[2:02:44] and he saw this old man come up
[2:02:52] and brother Brown thought, "Oh my." I
[2:02:55] mean, how is he going to do this?
[2:02:58] But he said all of a sudden the Holy
[2:03:00] Ghost descended. He says, "Look out of
[2:03:03] the way.
[2:03:05] platform isn't big enough.
[2:03:10] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; So, it's not your life as you heard
[2:03:13] tonight.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; It's God life in you.
[2:03:21] All this message is doing is confirming
[2:03:23] you always had eternal life.
[2:03:30] He said you never got eternal life and
[2:03:32] that you got saved.
[2:03:35] He said when Jesus came by
[2:03:38] &gt;&gt; and you said that's Jesus,
[2:03:41] &gt;&gt; it was proving
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; you came from his thoughts.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; So if you came from his thoughts, you're
[2:03:47] going to go back to his thoughts.
[2:03:50] To God be the glory,
[2:03:54] passionate,
[2:03:56] zealous.
[2:03:58] &gt;&gt; You brothers, this message tonight came
[2:04:01] from you this morning. Amen.
[2:04:08] When you brothers brought the
[2:04:10] translations from in language when they
[2:04:15] smile.
[2:04:17] Huh. When you we I felt blood paper
[2:04:21] and I saw the pencil
[2:04:24] transcript.
[2:04:27] My heart started to burn.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then I want to say to you,
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; take the book
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; and you say,
[2:04:36] &gt;&gt; "Give me the book."
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:40] &gt;&gt; And you'll prophesy again.
[2:04:43] &gt;&gt; What is he saying there? The one that
[2:04:45] was in William Brandon prophesied.
[2:04:48] But the bride is going to prophesy
[2:04:49] again.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; We're going to say what he said.
[2:04:53] &gt;&gt; We're going to do what he did.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:59] Ah,
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[2:05:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; Shall we stand as we read the word?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Now, when you've had enough,
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; if you had enough, you just go like
[2:05:14] this.
[2:05:18] Stop. Stop. Stop.
[2:05:20] Let my people go.
[2:05:29] Can we turn to Romans 8?
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; We'll read at verse 15.
[2:05:43] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 8.
[2:05:48] &gt;&gt; Verse 15.
[2:05:50] The Bible says, "For we have not
[2:05:53] received the spirit of bondage
[2:05:57] &gt;&gt; again to fear,
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; but we have except we have received the
[2:06:02] spirit of adoption,
[2:06:05] whereby we cry, Abba, Father,
[2:06:09] my father, my father."
[2:06:12] That's what your cry has been.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; God heard your cry in the East Nile. I
[2:06:18] preached. I told Michael as we were
[2:06:20] going back home at the hotel,
[2:06:24] I said, "Those brothers didn't know what
[2:06:25] they did to me today
[2:06:28] because I just preached on crying out."
[2:06:34] And brother Brandham preached on birth
[2:06:35] pains.
[2:06:37] Is that correct? Birth pains. And in
[2:06:40] birth pains, he said, "For a baby to
[2:06:42] know that needs something, it has to
[2:06:43] cry.
[2:06:48] So there's something in you crying out.
[2:06:51] We need to get the message in our
[2:06:53] language.
[2:06:55] And I say we're going to get the message
[2:06:57] to you in your language by the grace of
[2:07:00] almighty God. There's no more waiting,
[2:07:02] but it'll take time to get it to you.
[2:07:06] And if we're children,
[2:07:10] are you reading it with me, please?
[2:07:13] Verse 17.
[2:07:16] And if we're children,
[2:07:19] &gt;&gt; we're hes
[2:07:24] of God.
[2:07:26] &gt;&gt; Join hes with Christ.
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; If so be that we suffer with him,
[2:07:34] that we may also be glorified together.
[2:07:38] For I reckon that the suffering of this
[2:07:41] present time
[2:07:44] are not worthy to be compared with the
[2:07:46] glory which shall be revealed.
[2:07:52] Where's the revealing?
[2:07:55] What does your Bible say is revealed in
[2:08:00] how do you say us?
[2:08:05] The words being mu
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; in us
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; in us
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; in you.
[2:08:12] &gt;&gt; M
[2:08:14] &gt;&gt; in us.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:08:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; In us in it.
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:25] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; We're hes
[2:08:29] like servants.
[2:08:32] &gt;&gt; Live like sons.
[2:08:34] Amen.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; Joint hes with the anointed almighty
[2:08:40] God.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; That's why he says in the message,
[2:08:49] if God be with us, where's all his
[2:08:50] miracles?
[2:08:53] If God's with us, where's his miracles?
[2:08:56] If I'm air, where's the miracles that
[2:08:59] follow?
[2:09:01] I want you to look around the room.
[2:09:04] Go ahead. Turn around the room. Turn
[2:09:06] around. Turn around. Turn around. Look
[2:09:07] at Look at each other.
[2:09:10] Go. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You're
[2:09:12] going to dwell with them in heaven.
[2:09:18] &gt;&gt; Huh? Oh, I can't look. I can't look.
[2:09:24] Each one here is a miracle.
[2:09:28] Come. I I I want you to see this.
[2:09:32] Brother Brham said you've got to become
[2:09:34] a miracle before you can see a miracle.
[2:09:39] Right? So then if if God has become a
[2:09:41] miracle in your life,
[2:09:44] then I can look at you and see the
[2:09:46] miracle. People say, "I want to raise
[2:09:49] them out of a a wheelchair. I want to
[2:09:51] raise them up.
[2:09:55] I I want the blind to see.
[2:09:58] I was blind.
[2:10:00] I was blind in sin and trespasses,
[2:10:04] but God rich in mercy put eyes on my
[2:10:08] eyes and the blind is now seeing.
[2:10:12] You're seeing it's not your ability,
[2:10:15] it's the ability of God in you.
[2:10:19] Joint hes with Christ.
[2:10:23] Amen.
[2:10:27] Verse
[2:10:31] 19.
[2:10:33] &gt;&gt; For the earnest expectation of the
[2:10:36] creature waitth for the manifestation of
[2:10:39] the sons of God.
[2:10:45] Now since Paul wrote that to the Romans,
[2:10:49] that was a prophecy. As Michael was
[2:10:51] saying,
[2:10:53] brother Bram said, "In things that are
[2:10:54] to be." When Isaiah When Isaiah
[2:10:58] &gt;&gt; said, "A virgin shall conceive."
[2:11:01] That was the word of God. Traveling,
[2:11:04] traveling, traveling, traveling. But
[2:11:07] finally, it found the womb of Mary
[2:11:11] and brought forth the Christ.
[2:11:14] The prophecy was
[2:11:17] there will be a bride victorious
[2:11:20] without spot
[2:11:23] without wrinkle
[2:11:25] without sin
[2:11:27] without blemish.
[2:11:29] You're the spotless virgin bride of
[2:11:32] Jesus Christ.
[2:11:37] &gt;&gt; You may have your seats.
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; You okay?
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:11:44] I I was so enjoying brother Michael
[2:11:48] I was thinking keep on keep on
[2:11:53] it's getting real good
[2:11:56] you the mentality is this
[2:11:59] and I don't mean this disrespectful
[2:12:00] because I'm an old man
[2:12:04] all these young preachers
[2:12:06] I'm I'm an old man well let me ask you
[2:12:09] is the Holy Spirit old
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; or is it young. Let me ask you, it it's
[2:12:17] your body that's getting old,
[2:12:19] but the spirit in you is young.
[2:12:24] So, we don't put the youth down and say,
[2:12:27] "What does he know?" It's God in the
[2:12:30] man.
[2:12:32] Is God in you?
[2:12:35] Recognizing God in one another.
[2:12:38] Hallelujah.
[2:12:44] So what brother Ram said,
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; he said the greatest miracle is not
[2:12:49] bringing them out of wheelchairs or
[2:12:51] seeing the blind see or the deaf hear.
[2:12:55] He said the greatest miracle is for the
[2:12:57] word to come by your way and change you,
[2:13:01] change you from a sinner to a saint.
[2:13:07] Glory.
[2:13:09] Take that devil.
[2:13:12] Come on, take it, devil.
[2:13:19] Oh,
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; brother, brother Tom, where are you
[2:13:21] getting this?
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:13:27] Christ is a mystery God revealed.
[2:13:30] Then what was the theme of the song,
[2:13:34] right? What was the theme of the message
[2:13:36] theme?
[2:13:38] &gt;&gt; Christ in you.
[2:13:40] All that was in God,
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; he poured into Christ.
[2:13:46] &gt;&gt; All that was in Christ,
[2:13:48] &gt;&gt; he's poured into you
[2:13:50] today,
[2:13:52] this day, the sons of God are to be
[2:13:54] manifested.
[2:13:56] That's why the devil's trying to stop
[2:13:58] you from getting the message.
[2:14:00] We say, "Get behind us, Satan."
[2:14:07] Brother says in page n uh 86,
[2:14:12] he said, "Oh, the devil's howling about
[2:14:14] this,
[2:14:16] the manifested truth
[2:14:19] of the promised word
[2:14:23] in her alone."
[2:14:27] Not not in a serpent seed.
[2:14:31] in you.
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's helling mode.
[2:14:36] Because if you get this, you will always
[2:14:39] live in the victory of Christ.
[2:14:46] Brother Brandham says in this message
[2:14:47] book,
[2:14:49] the church, the bride is his victory.
[2:14:54] Hallelujah.
[2:14:57] Victory is mine.
[2:15:00] Victory is mine.
[2:15:02] &gt;&gt; Victory today is mine.
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; I told Satan, get behind,
[2:15:09] &gt;&gt; victory today, tomorrow, the next day,
[2:15:13] the next day.
[2:15:20] Glory.
[2:15:21] &gt;&gt; I'm feeling mighty fine.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; I've got heaven on my mind.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:29] He said when Jesus said
[2:15:32] he said if I cast out devils by the
[2:15:34] finger of God,
[2:15:36] who do you cast among?
[2:15:40] He stood alone and his church stands
[2:15:43] alone.
[2:15:48] The denominations are going to turn on
[2:15:50] her.
[2:15:52] Christ is in her alone.
[2:15:56] Don't worry. Greater is he that's in you
[2:16:00] than he that's in the world. I've got
[2:16:03] the life of God in me. I got the life of
[2:16:06] God in me.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. I've got his life, his nature,
[2:16:11] his ability.
[2:16:13] I got the life of God in me. Amen. She
[2:16:18] is now risen.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; Come on, church. She is now risen
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; by the vindicated word.
[2:16:30] Amen.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; I was in the old days
[2:16:37] a long-haired dope smoking hippie.
[2:16:45] But when Jesus came,
[2:16:48] he changed me.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; All I was seeing
[2:16:54] was the life in me.
[2:16:57] calling out to him.
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; And when he came to me,
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't go to him.
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus found you.
[2:17:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus finds his seed.
[2:17:11] &gt;&gt; That's why he said Jehovah eagle.
[2:17:15] It's flying over.
[2:17:17] &gt;&gt; Not looking for chickens.
[2:17:19] He's looking for that last gene that was
[2:17:22] in that nest.
[2:17:24] &gt;&gt; It's me, mama.
[2:17:26] It's me.
[2:17:28] He heard the cry.
[2:17:30] He was stuck in the chicken coop.
[2:17:33] He looked
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; He looked at the chickens.
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; He looked at the denominations.
[2:17:39] He said, "They're nothing but eagle's
[2:17:40] food.
[2:17:46] Huh?
[2:17:47] &gt;&gt; Don't worry about the denominations.
[2:17:50] Don't worry about it whatsoever
[2:17:53] because the life has already gone out of
[2:17:55] it.
[2:17:57] The life of Christ is in you.
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; So, we just laid a little foundation.
[2:18:14] &gt;&gt; Now, we get it to the the meat of the
[2:18:17] matter.
[2:18:20] Please turn in the Bible
[2:18:24] to Isaiah 9:6.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 9:6.
[2:18:32] as that seed was spoken by Isaiah.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; For it says, "Unto us a child is born,
[2:18:41] and unto us a son is given,
[2:18:48] and the government shall be upon his
[2:18:49] shoulder,
[2:18:51] and his name shall be called wonderful
[2:18:54] counselor,
[2:18:56] a mighty God." No, no, no, no. Say no,
[2:19:01] no, no, no.
[2:19:03] &gt;&gt; Yeah. No, no, no. It does not say a
[2:19:05] mighty God.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; It says the mighty God,
[2:19:13] &gt;&gt; not a trinity.
[2:19:15] The mighty God
[2:19:18] and to us a child is born. Unto us a son
[2:19:20] is given. It was God in flesh.
[2:19:25] He Jehovah
[2:19:27] redeeming fallen man.
[2:19:30] Glory. Hallelujah.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; You heard it tonight. He redeemed Andrew
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; and Peter.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; And I always wondered
[2:19:39] when John the Baptist was at the river
[2:19:41] Jordan
[2:19:43] and the Bible says that there were
[2:19:47] lining the banks heresies, Sadducees.
[2:19:52] But John said, "Behold
[2:19:56] the lamb of God that taketh away the
[2:19:59] sins of the world." How many left?
[2:20:03] &gt;&gt; I want to ask you,
[2:20:05] &gt;&gt; your Bible said,
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; Andrew, Andrew, and another disciple,
[2:20:11] two out of the multitudes,
[2:20:14] Brother Ram said, one in a million.
[2:20:17] It's not many. And it's not everyone
[2:20:20] that says Lord Lord Lord will enter in.
[2:20:23] He says be gone for me. I never knew
[2:20:25] you.
[2:20:26] That new that new means epigenosco
[2:20:31] in the Greek it actually means a sexual
[2:20:33] relationship.
[2:20:36] As Michael was talking about Tamar,
[2:20:45] I never had relationship.
[2:20:49] I never knew you. I never communed with
[2:20:53] you. I never had relationship with you.
[2:20:57] But I've only had relationship
[2:21:00] with the elect of God,
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; chosen in him before the foundation of
[2:21:06] the world.
[2:21:08] You were chosen,
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; not by your pastor.
[2:21:12] &gt;&gt; You weren't chosen by me.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; You weren't chosen by any man,
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; but Jesus Christ himself.
[2:21:21] What did brother say? Take your hands
[2:21:26] off of God's property.
[2:21:29] Satan, take your hands off of God's
[2:21:33] property.
[2:21:34] You're God's property.
[2:21:37] So God's watching over you.
[2:21:40] Be passionate.
[2:21:43] God's in my life.
[2:21:45] God's in your life.
[2:21:48] Hallelujah.
[2:21:54] unto us shall be called wonderful
[2:21:55] counselor, the mighty God.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; I want you to take a look at that word
[2:22:01] mighty God.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; That means algabon.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; That means the all powerful,
[2:22:11] no loss of power.
[2:22:14] It is perpetual life.
[2:22:17] God has just been dealing with me on
[2:22:18] perpetual life.
[2:22:21] Man is always looking for perpetual
[2:22:22] life.
[2:22:25] There's only one that has perpetual life
[2:22:27] and that is God life. And you've got
[2:22:30] perpetual life. You were just planted in
[2:22:33] the garden of the seven church. At the
[2:22:36] end of the seven church age,
[2:22:39] at the rising of the sun,
[2:22:42] that light was shining at harvest time.
[2:22:45] He says, "Can't you hear the combines
[2:22:47] coming?"
[2:22:48] the combine. Sorry. Can't you hear the
[2:22:51] combines coming
[2:22:54] tractor
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; at harvest time
[2:22:58] gathering the grain?
[2:23:00] Can't you hear that?
[2:23:03] So, let me ask you a question. If the
[2:23:06] mighty God
[2:23:09] is in you,
[2:23:11] what's your problem?
[2:23:21] What's your problem?
[2:23:24] I got God in me.
[2:23:26] I'm passionate for the word of the Lord.
[2:23:30] Open the door. I just had a bad day
[2:23:33] today.
[2:23:36] Bad day. You got God in you. You can
[2:23:40] never have a bad day.
[2:23:45] Hallelujah.
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; When she realizes,
[2:23:52] when she realizes
[2:23:55] who she is, then the rapture takes
[2:23:58] place.
[2:24:00] Amen. Amen. So God had at harvest time
[2:24:04] one who came to maturity.
[2:24:07] And so God waved that sheath
[2:24:12] over you.
[2:24:14] So the life that was in William Brham,
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; which was Christ, that same life is now
[2:24:20] in you.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:23] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram says, he says, "Face the
[2:24:26] challenge.
[2:24:28] That's why that's why David never ran
[2:24:30] away from it."
[2:24:32] He faced the challenge. He ran to his
[2:24:35] problem.
[2:24:37] He didn't run away from his problem. He
[2:24:39] ran to his problem
[2:24:41] and say, "Goliath
[2:24:44] today, I'll have your head."
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; What was he doing? Prophesying again.
[2:24:51] Amen. He prophesied.
[2:24:55] He spoke it. And God came behind him and
[2:24:59] confirmed what he said.
[2:25:01] Brother said, "You speak it. You speak
[2:25:04] it. You speak it.
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; I am God's victory.
[2:25:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; Brother Bram said,
[2:25:15] &gt;&gt; he said, "The high priest
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; cannot move until first you confess it.
[2:25:25] I want you to say in your language,
[2:25:28] I am
[2:25:30] &gt;&gt; his
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; victory.
[2:25:37] You say it, you watch the high priest
[2:25:39] come behind it.
[2:25:43] You want to speak doubt,
[2:25:45] the devil will come behind you.
[2:25:48] You speak truth and God comes behind it.
[2:25:54] I know in whom I have believed and I am
[2:25:58] persuaded
[2:26:00] that he is able to keep that
[2:26:04] which he's committed unto me.
[2:26:07] Why? We have relationship with God. That
[2:26:11] seed as you heard is in you.
[2:26:16] I love it. It's not a doctrine. It's
[2:26:20] life.
[2:26:24] Hallelujah.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; So now we know that Jesus is the mighty
[2:26:28] God.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the mighty God.
[2:26:33] &gt;&gt; He's the algabon.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; He never diminishes in power. All that
[2:26:38] was in God, he poured into Christ.
[2:26:42] All that was in Christ, he now has
[2:26:45] poured into Christ.
[2:26:48] I am his victory.
[2:26:55] You say, "Brother Tom, where are you
[2:26:56] getting?"
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; Well, Brother Michael, he he read out of
[2:27:01] Hebrews there where
[2:27:03] he talked about Samson and Gideon,
[2:27:08] the hall of heroes of faith.
[2:27:13] So, our hero Gideon
[2:27:17] was hiding behind
[2:27:23] Why? Because the Medionites,
[2:27:25] the Amalachites,
[2:27:27] the Amorites,
[2:27:30] children of the east,
[2:27:32] they were coming to destroy them at
[2:27:33] harvest time.
[2:27:36] When was it, brother Tom? When the life
[2:27:39] is back into the seed,
[2:27:41] that's when the devil wants to steal
[2:27:43] your life.
[2:27:45] But now we see in shadow form in the Old
[2:27:47] Testament.
[2:27:50] that Gideon was our type
[2:27:53] and God called him
[2:27:56] the mighty man of valor.
[2:27:59] &gt;&gt; What am I saying to you tonight?
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; You're the mighty bride of valor.
[2:28:05] That was the masculine. We are the
[2:28:07] feminine,
[2:28:09] the Old Testament.
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; He's the husband
[2:28:16] and we're the bride.
[2:28:19] Amen.
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; So, here was Gideon hiding behind the
[2:28:22] wine press.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; And God didn't see his hiding.
[2:28:28] He saw what was in him.
[2:28:31] It's white.
[2:28:33] So, the Bible says
[2:28:36] in Judges, you can read it because we're
[2:28:37] trying to save time.
[2:28:40] In Judges chapter 7, the Bible says that
[2:28:44] God sent a prophet. God sent a prophet.
[2:28:48] He said, "The God that parted the Red
[2:28:49] Sea,
[2:28:51] &gt;&gt; the God that rained down mana, the God
[2:28:54] that brought you here into the land,
[2:28:57] he's the God of glory."
[2:28:59] But they had gotten away from God.
[2:29:03] But God's only interested in his seed.
[2:29:08] Do you get that? He's not interested in
[2:29:11] serpent seed.
[2:29:14] He's only interested in his own.
[2:29:19] He knew where Gideon would be
[2:29:23] and he planted himself at a tree
[2:29:30] after the prophet's message.
[2:29:35] Lord, the Bible says
[2:29:38] Revelation 10:1
[2:29:41] after Revelation 10:7
[2:29:45] was calling him the mighty man of valor.
[2:29:49] After the prophets gone off the scene,
[2:29:52] you might have thought, "I'm a little
[2:29:53] weak.
[2:29:55] I just got enough to feed myself."
[2:29:59] God looked past his flesh.
[2:30:04] He said, "You're not a weakling.
[2:30:07] You're a mighty man.
[2:30:10] Something was stirring in him.
[2:30:14] You wait here. You wait here." And he
[2:30:16] got himself a kid. And he made some
[2:30:18] rocks and he found a rock.
[2:30:23] He found the revelation
[2:30:25] of what the word said he was.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; And God said to him, "Drive out.
[2:30:33] drive out the enemy.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah, I'll do that.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says that there's 135,000
[2:30:43] innumerable
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; coming into Israel.
[2:30:48] So Gideon mastered upon 32,000
[2:30:53] 500, you know, give or take 100.
[2:30:58] God said, "No way.
[2:31:00] If I let 32,000 let go,
[2:31:04] you'll say you drove them out.
[2:31:07] So, I'm going to divide the right from
[2:31:08] the wrong.
[2:31:10] That's what he's been doing for a long
[2:31:12] time now.
[2:31:14] Those that bowed down and lapped up
[2:31:16] their water,
[2:31:20] let them go home, they've been bowing to
[2:31:22] idols.
[2:31:25] But those that took the water up with
[2:31:26] their
[2:31:28] drank,
[2:31:30] He says those are the ones getting
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; and there was only 300 out of 35,000
[2:31:38] 001%
[2:31:43] 01%
[2:31:46] one you got 1%
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; 1% of 100
[2:31:53] &gt;&gt; is
[2:31:56] 0.1
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; yeah that's good that's good they'll
[2:31:59] figure it out.
[2:32:01] A very small number
[2:32:04] &gt;&gt; because God wanted the glory,
[2:32:08] &gt;&gt; not you
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; and not me.
[2:32:16] &gt;&gt; So Gideon goes
[2:32:18] and as now he's called the mighty man of
[2:32:20] valor.
[2:32:22] Okay, I need a sword like David. I need
[2:32:25] a sling.
[2:32:27] No, Gideon.
[2:32:29] No, no. Get yourself a clay pot.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; Get yourself a light.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; Put it in the pot.
[2:32:43] What are you going to do?
[2:32:45] No spear,
[2:32:48] no sword?
[2:32:49] No. But the revelation came
[2:32:52] the sword of the Lord
[2:32:56] and of Gideon.
[2:32:58] It wasn't a sword natural.
[2:33:01] The word of God is quick and powerful
[2:33:04] more than any other sword.
[2:33:07] Gideon had to believe the light in his
[2:33:10] vessel
[2:33:12] was enough to drive the devil out.
[2:33:15] And they gave a shout and a trump
[2:33:18] and it drove the enemy away. I say to
[2:33:22] you church in Uganda,
[2:33:24] rise up you mighty man.
[2:33:27] Be passionate,
[2:33:29] be zealous.
[2:33:32] The Bible goes on to say he went after
[2:33:35] Zorbin
[2:33:37] and he went after another king
[2:33:40] and he got him on the run.
[2:33:43] The Bible says he was weary,
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; but he kept pursuing.
[2:33:51] You might be a little weary, but I want
[2:33:54] to encourage you tonight. Keep pressing
[2:33:56] on, Brian. Keep pressing on. You might
[2:33:59] be a little weary, but we're running the
[2:34:02] last lap. I see heaven
[2:34:05] just before us. I see a rapture change.
[2:34:09] I see a new body. and I'm passionate
[2:34:12] about it.
[2:34:16] Glory.
[2:34:18] So I say Uganda,
[2:34:20] put the light in your vessel.
[2:34:23] Put the light in your vessel and let the
[2:34:26] light shine for the glory of God. The
[2:34:29] enemy, we're on the run.
[2:34:33] May your lives in Christ
[2:34:37] put the devil on the run.
[2:34:39] God bless you.
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; We're just beginning.
[2:34:52] &gt;&gt; Come on, let's give the Lord another big
[2:34:55] hand clap of praise.
[2:34:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:35:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; Oh my. That was just too soon.
[2:35:10] We were just still enjoying
[2:35:13] or maybe they rest a bit and then we
[2:35:14] continue.
[2:35:17] Praise God,
[2:35:19] friends. You know, I I just love this
[2:35:21] message.
[2:35:23] This is not about, you know, any man.
[2:35:28] It's about Christ in us in you.
[2:35:32] And by the way, that's the message of
[2:35:34] the hour.
[2:35:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's the essence of the message.
[2:35:39] It's Christ revealed in us.
[2:35:42] Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[2:35:46] The bride is the mystery of Christ
[2:35:47] revealed.
[2:35:49] And we are so thankful for what we have
[2:35:51] had today.
[2:35:53] Amen. Let us give him a clap of praise.
[2:35:58] Oh, praise God.
[2:36:01] Amen.
[2:36:03] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Thank
[2:36:06] you so much, brother Tom. Thank you,
[2:36:08] brother Michael. We really, really
[2:36:09] appreciate
[2:36:11] the word this evening and all the
[2:36:14] different ones that have come. Brother
[2:36:16] Steven, God bless you so much.
[2:36:19] I see sister Jesse over there.
[2:36:22] Amen. God bless you. Is your husband
[2:36:25] here as well? Oh, he always hides
[2:36:28] himself over there. God bless you. God
[2:36:32] bless you so much. Thank you for coming.
[2:36:34] I see brother Ken Vianga there.
[2:36:37] God bless you sir. Thank you so much for
[2:36:38] coming. I'm telling you all of you that
[2:36:41] have come from other fellowships.
[2:36:43] I know Wednesday evening is not easy
[2:36:47] but how many can say it's been worth it.
[2:36:52] It's been worth it.
[2:36:54] Amen. And after what we have heard,
[2:36:57] we can say this. Though the way may be
[2:37:00] funny,
[2:37:02] I will praise the Lord.
[2:37:04] Pastor Bate, I'm so happy to see you
[2:37:06] tonight and your wife over here. God
[2:37:08] bless you so much. Actually, um um there
[2:37:11] are several churches that have been

[2:37:15] service
[2:37:17] and his is one of them. And uh so he's
[2:37:21] here. He told them, I'm not preaching
[2:37:22] this Wednesday evening.
[2:37:25] I want you to stream at DVA.
[2:37:28] So thank you so much, Pastor. God bless
[2:37:30] you. I know there are others from other

[3:04:03] and accommodation
[3:04:05] and the rest of the things. But if young
[3:04:07] people cannot do 100%
[3:04:12] encourage them to get in touch with us.
