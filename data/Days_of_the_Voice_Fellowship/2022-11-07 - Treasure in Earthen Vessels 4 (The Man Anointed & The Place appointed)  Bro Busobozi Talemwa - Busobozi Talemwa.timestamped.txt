[1:42] brothers students
[1:53] so so if you cannot raise in the morning
[2:00] but I think it's something we should
[2:02] have a discussion on
[2:05] the service is very early in the morning
[2:08] and you know we our concentration is
[2:10] still up before the sun comes
[2:15] [Music]
[2:16] foreign
[2:34] [Music]

[3:13] [Music]
[3:26] foreign
[3:30] [Music]
[3:34] [Applause]
[3:35] [Music]
[3:47] [Applause]
[3:49] [Music]
[3:58] [Music]
[4:19] [Applause]
[4:24] [Music]
[4:28] [Applause]
[4:28] [Music]
[4:32] [Applause]
[4:35] [Music]
[4:43] he is
[4:45] [Music]
[4:52] keeping me
[4:54] Jesus keeping me
[4:57] he is keeping me he is the Holy Ghost on
[5:02] Fire
[5:03] [Music]
[5:06] Jesus is keeping me alive
[5:12] or praise this morning
[5:15] hallelujah thank you Jesus
[5:19] you are keeping us alive this morning
[5:26] oh thank you Jesus
[5:29] Lord we are happy this morning
[5:57] [Music]
[6:02] chapter 7.
[6:06] [Music]
[6:11] Judges chapter seven
[6:14] is
[6:31] just right after Joshua but okay what is
[6:34] how
[6:48] we are going to read a
[6:50] people read only one verse and then we
[6:52] you know
[6:54] to the currency
[6:59] versus uh 21.
[7:07] and they stood every man in his place
[7:10] round about the camp and all the host
[7:12] rain and cried and fled
[7:15] foreign
[8:17] foreign
[8:57] [Music]
[9:32] uh keep his treasures in a vessel of of
[9:35] of of metal or in a vessel of something
[9:40] like like aluminum or something like
[9:41] that yeah
[9:47] because his confidence is not in the
[9:50] first so where he is keeping the
[9:52] treasure because
[9:57] his confidence is in the Treasure itself
[10:02] so The Treasure of God is
[10:05] not the flesh your flesh The Treasure of
[10:10] God is what he has deposited
[10:13] and what he has deposited in you is the
[10:16] word of God
[10:18] of God is a light that is shining in
[10:21] your life
[10:22] and the more it shines it goes on
[10:25] growing bigger and bigger and bigger
[10:30] the more you hear the word the more
[10:33] light just strikes you don't come away
[10:38] it becomes bigger and bigger
[10:42] and you know that when the light strikes
[10:46] there is one thing that happened without
[10:49] Darkness please
[10:51] Darkness and Light cannot be in the same
[10:54] place at the same time
[10:59] when when life comes Darkness please
[11:03] rather God said in the beginning
[11:12] and I want to say that when we hear the
[11:14] word of God in our life
[11:20] you believe that church
[11:23] praise the name of the Lord
[11:25] amen so you have to get out what is out
[11:28] of me this morning by saying amen
[11:32] about me now
[11:34] you helped me preach this morning
[11:36] so we can see what the Holy Spirit has
[11:38] for us now
[11:42] whenever God sends a light Captain
[11:46] there is a man anointed to received
[11:50] there is a place
[11:56] what I'm saying is
[11:59] you have your place in the body of
[12:01] Christ
[12:05] and that blessed Rich French cannot be
[12:08] replaced by another woman alive that
[12:10] cheat them you know people sometimes
[12:12] around why do we have a lot of fights
[12:15] and a lot of battles
[12:18] because people are afraid of others
[12:21] taking their pictures
[12:32] you know you find that if a Man Loves a
[12:35] Woman
[12:36] especially in Africa here where we have
[12:39] polygamy
[12:41] you find that uh you know a man has more
[12:45] than one woman
[12:47] and you know polygamy is almost legally
[12:49] accepted in our country
[12:53] so you will find that all these women
[12:55] will be fighting
[12:57] for their place
[13:02] and in the same way even when a man is
[13:04] married
[13:20] [Music]
[13:52] [Music]
[14:03] that he can represent foreign
[15:05] and there is a place anointed our place
[15:08] appointed I told which friendship for
[15:11] God to bless you he wants to bless you
[15:14] there
[15:16] so that he can anoint you come after and
[15:19] use you in my dreams
[15:25] praise the name of the Lord I want to
[15:27] look at verse Psalms 105 13.
[15:33] when they went from one nation to
[15:36] another from one Kingdom to another he
[15:38] suffered no man to do them wrong yeah he
[15:40] reproved the Kings for their sex saying
[15:42] that's not my anointed and do my
[15:44] prophets know how to
[15:49] foreign
[15:53] 105 13.
[15:55] 105 13 yes
[16:06] [Music]
[16:14] praise the name of the Lord saying
[16:17] that's not my anointed
[16:23] foreign
[17:04] okay
[17:09] I'm so glad that I can say um
[17:26] God always wants to correct his own
[17:28] cartoon
[17:30] just like children parents who are here
[17:34] how many of you would like somebody to
[17:36] spank your child
[17:41] many of you would not want that
[17:44] even when your child has done something
[17:47] wrong
[17:48] you don't want anybody
[17:51] we want to be the one
[17:54] to spank your child
[17:57] because you can't hurt him
[18:00] somebody else
[18:06] is Anointed
[18:09] God never wants his prophets you'll be
[18:13] touched by anyone
[18:15] amen you notice in the Bible there was a
[18:19] Man Called Moses and Moses had given one
[18:23] of the laws
[18:24] no Israelite was supposed to marry out
[18:27] of Israelites
[18:30] Moses went and married an Ethiopians
[18:36] and he was supposed to be the prophet of
[18:39] God
[18:41] and when his sister and the other
[18:43] prophets and other brothers
[18:50] he said who are you to do that how come
[18:54] you do that and and
[18:57] you know the sister of Moses became sick
[19:01] and and and you know they could not get
[19:04] any remedies
[19:06] unless the man of God prayed and we've
[19:11] seen that over and over
[19:12] you know even at one place one of the
[19:15] men of God lied
[19:18] and you know this man took the woman in
[19:21] his in the Integrity of his heart
[19:22] without knowing what happened
[19:26] when God came down he was going to kill
[19:30] the kids he said how can you take the
[19:33] wife of my Prophet
[19:36] how dare you do that
[19:39] and he said now restore the man his wife
[19:44] and we find it over and over in
[19:47] scripture
[19:50] Elisha was walking on the road
[19:53] you know these little children who were
[19:55] not told well by their parents
[19:58] and they came scorning and laughing
[20:02] maybe they were laughing at his boat
[20:06] children can be on the villages
[21:47] you know he was seated you know you know
[21:50] he was signing all these papers which
[21:52] were declaring him as a king and giving
[21:53] middle authorities
[21:56] but maybe he was frustrated
[22:01] you know he was just on the table Yeah
[22:04] he was you know cigaretting some of his
[22:06] people to come on
[22:13] so these people went on the news
[22:17] they put it all over
[22:19] you know you know I think is this I
[22:22] think
[22:23] I mean this is a human being
[22:26] because he is
[22:36] not a normal human beings
[22:54] if you speak glasses on yourself
[22:56] finished
[23:10] foreign
[24:10] sometimes you can even reach a moment
[24:12] yeah
[24:15] when you are not going to pray but you
[24:19] just think
[24:20] and things will happen
[24:23] amenities
[24:34] we need to recognize our places
[24:37] [Music]
[24:56] the day you come to that realization
[24:59] that God is not going to give you
[25:02] breakthroughs because of your ability
[25:06] then my brother you will achievement
[25:12] and and really this subject that I'm
[25:14] speaking on is something about our day
[25:17] today living I'm talking again
[25:23] lives because of what we think of
[25:25] ourselves
[25:31] you know you always think law of
[25:34] yourself because
[25:35] people can't even stop God because I
[25:38] think law of themselves
[26:16] of Herod
[26:17] so that the horse of the midianites were
[26:20] on the north side of them by the hill of
[26:22] Murray in the valley and the Lord said
[26:24] unto Gideon the people that are with
[26:26] thee are too far many for me to give the
[26:29] midianites into their hands lest Israel
[26:31] want themselves against me saying mine
[26:33] owner understand and accept me
[26:36] Nicola
[26:39] [Music]
[27:19] maybe it wasn't the place appointed
[27:22] Charlie she said and they were not yet
[27:25] anointed
[27:26] so here Israel was suffering at the hand
[27:30] of the media night for years when he is
[27:56] let me tell you sometimes God
[28:10] but sometimes it doesn't get to do it
[28:14] because of the place where we are
[28:17] already poetry
[28:19] because if he does it at that place
[28:22] you will think it was your own strength
[28:26] you will think it was your own energy
[28:30] it was your ability
[28:32] and now God blesses you in a place
[28:37] for weakness
[28:40] it is at the place of weakness
[28:46] that God wants to anoint that much
[28:55] raise the name of the Lord and so we see
[28:59] here that these people 32 number one
[29:01] around to one the middle were always
[29:03] fighting against
[29:08] the Lord came to him
[29:11] he told him look I want you to go take a
[29:15] look and I've given the Middle East
[29:48] there are very many
[29:51] actually there were 22 000 people
[29:55] he said God these people are so many
[29:58] countries
[30:00] for me to give the immediates into their
[30:02] house
[30:11] the moment you think we can store the
[30:14] walls
[30:15] that you were so holy
[30:22] God will make sure
[30:25] you don't defeat your enemies
[30:30] the moment you think we can store the
[30:32] words you are so rich
[30:35] God Will Make sure
[30:37] you do not attain your goals
[30:41] the moment you think we cast all the
[30:44] words you have accumulated a lot of
[30:46] wisdom and knowledge
[30:52] and if you read this Bible very well it
[30:55] has happened over and over again
[31:00] God always confounds the wisdom of the
[31:03] wise
[31:06] am I preaching to someone
[31:09] God always confounds the wisdom of the
[31:11] world
[31:16] thank you for the amen those people
[31:19] sought for two minutes
[31:24] God is not in big crowds
[31:30] have you ever thought about it
[31:33] God is never in a big crowded
[31:36] and then someone will say hey Jesus had
[31:39] five thousand years wait a moment those
[31:44] five thousand were there for as long as
[31:46] they prayed and the fish was dead
[31:52] but even when the fish and the bread was
[31:55] there now you were at the middle name
[31:56] they could not stand the word
[32:00] when Jesus began to open the scroll yes
[32:04] we are single room is single they said
[32:07] these things are so hard for us
[32:08] how can he tell us to eat him and drink
[32:11] his blood
[32:14] we have to leave
[32:17] again and the Bible says the end shall
[32:21] not come until there is a falling away
[32:24] fast
[32:29] so don't fear if you hear some who said
[32:32] they have left a message
[32:35] that has to happen foreign
[33:37] [Applause]
[34:27] hallelujah amen those who hate me they
[34:29] go again and those who love me
[34:32] and they don't love me because they love
[34:34] me but I love me because they love the
[34:35] world
[34:38] those are the ones
[34:41] amen and every Pastor that preaches the
[34:44] word
[34:46] that conviction
[34:49] you know you don't want people to love
[34:51] you because you're a superstar
[34:56] foreign
[35:30] Jesus yes remained only with a few yes
[35:39] one of them was still uh
[35:42] the Devil Himself
[35:47] Jesus Christ
[36:03] let me tell you we don't cut down our
[36:06] army by chasing our people
[36:08] um
[36:12] by giving people wrong and bad attitude
[36:18] foreign
[36:36] in the ears of the people saying
[36:38] whatsoever is fearful and Afraid let him
[36:41] return and depart Ali from the ma from
[36:43] Mount Gilead and they returned of the
[36:46] people 20 and 2000 and there remain ten
[36:49] thousand
[36:50] foreign
[36:58] [Music]
[37:14] that's why you sit in churches
[37:19] every Church
[37:25] but people will keep coming whatever and
[37:29] people will keep going again and then
[37:31] you ask yourself who chased them
[37:33] and who kept those ones who stayed
[37:37] out at any time
[37:43] I think we have something wrong
[37:45] people who love to do that
[37:49] you know make you know puts them in that
[37:52] kind of uh spiral
[37:56] oh I think there's something wrong
[37:59] you know maybe our music has a problem
[38:07] let me tell you these things could all
[38:09] be true
[38:10] but the true seed of God now he is
[38:37] that is being preached
[38:40] and here 22 000 people left in between
[38:47] and over the years that I've been
[38:49] preaching this message
[38:53] on average 15 years but I've noticed
[38:57] that and you know God has also allowed
[39:00] me to be in the beginning assemblies
[39:05] I've never in all my life uh uh been or
[39:10] attended uh a mega church
[39:14] I've preached to some of them
[39:17] but on occasions all my life I've dealt
[39:22] with small groups
[39:28] but you know you watch a church grow
[39:30] from 50 people
[39:36] by the time you get 10 people but why is
[39:39] it coming you have in and out you have
[39:42] had about 50 people
[39:45] um
[39:47] and all those take a piece of your life
[39:51] as a minister
[39:55] you pray with each of them preach to
[39:59] them you pray with them
[40:02] and only for them to leave again
[40:07] foreign
[40:17] foreign
[41:06] hallelujah amen there is always a chance
[41:08] until the chance is not there what
[41:10] happened
[41:12] let me tell you that the very last
[41:16] person that was saved when Jesus was on
[41:18] earth
[41:23] when Jesus died on the cross yesterday
[41:25] he died on the very last minute it was
[41:29] seven last minute
[41:32] imagine there were many people who were
[41:35] in Paradise for years and years and
[41:37] years
[41:43] and they were all waiting for the
[41:46] Messiah to come and redeem because there
[41:49] was a
[41:50] prophecya and he will take them all out
[41:53] of the grace just like we have a promise
[41:56] also our Christ Jesus is going to come
[42:00] the crystal again and it will take us
[42:02] out of the grace
[42:03] my brother died with Jesus foreign
[42:51] what if he was sad
[42:54] I don't even want to preach anymore
[42:59] how can the father let me suffer like
[43:02] this
[43:03] how can I go through this
[43:05] time for them I am sad now I am hungry
[43:11] that Soul would have been lost
[43:15] even at that better moment remember to
[43:18] say it ain't true these were two Pips
[43:23] that one of them
[43:27] [Music]
[43:29] Serve Yourself
[43:32] not foreign
[43:43] you never say that there you'll get it
[43:46] but Jesus
[43:51] he was full of grace
[43:56] and full of Truth
[44:00] oh Hallelujah some Believers are so full
[44:03] of truth that they have no Grace at all
[44:06] right
[44:12] hey
[44:14] Jesus was full of grace and truth
[44:18] he saw this man
[44:20] he did not comment
[44:23] but because Jesus was full of grace
[44:27] this man was touched
[44:36] thank you
[44:42] [Music]
[44:44] what about the man who has died for no
[44:47] reason foreign
[45:01] [Applause]

[45:37] hallelujah hallelujah and that moment
[45:42] you will be in Paradise
[45:48] hallelujah amen in less than 24 hours

[46:31] brother
[46:32] want to even think you're better than
[46:34] others

[46:40] approach to this message
[46:48] foreign
[47:28] hahaha

[49:32] because
[49:42] sometimes
[49:55] and then at the end of the days
[50:30] [Music]
[50:34] I want to use you
[50:38] Hallelujah
[50:40] without your weakness
[50:44] yes yes with all your insufficience

[51:02] and then the Army becomes very small
[51:06] the Lesser you become
[51:09] the more happy God is
[51:17] the money
[51:21] praise the Lord come and give us the way
[51:24] so we go to verse 4.

[52:24] City dip
[52:30] How can I cannot live like that um
[52:34] they are afraid
[52:38] but yeah because they think they can't
[52:41] do it
[52:43] the plastic is so great
[52:45] that's when God says let them go away
[52:49] so I ask you are you afraid

[52:56] okay
[53:08] [Music]
[53:21] [Music]
[53:34] is not in yourself
[53:38] it is in the light
[53:44] it is

[54:58] amen without you without you
[55:03] um
[55:10] we have a a proverb in Uganda
[55:13] which says
[55:16] those that are together they can bite
[55:20] the meat
[55:22] foreign
[55:49] [Music]
[55:59] God looks at the weakness
[56:03] and the ability to accept that weakness
[56:07] if you can accept your weakness
[56:10] you can accept history
[56:15] and so they remained only 20 only 10
[56:20] 000.
[56:22] as if that is not enough
[56:28] foreign
[56:35] the people are yet too many
[56:38] bring them down onto the water
[56:41] and I will try them for thee there
[56:46] and it shall be that of whom I say unto
[56:50] thee this shall go with thee the same
[56:52] shall go with this
[56:57] unto thee this shall not go with thee
[57:00] the same shall not okay
[57:08] so he brought down the people onto the
[57:10] water
[57:12] and the Lord
[57:14] everyone
