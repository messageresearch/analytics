[1:15:12] thank you
[1:15:13] brother Murphy and I met him at campus
[1:15:16] in my first semester University
[1:15:24] What attracted me to brother Marvin
[1:15:28] uh
[1:15:29] he was a very humble brother
[1:15:34] and he was always moving with these
[1:15:37] people
[1:15:40] Whenever there is no lecture in class I
[1:15:43] could see him opening the Bible
[1:15:48] and he was not ashamed of his baby
[1:15:52] so for me I was attracted to share with
[1:15:55] him
[1:15:58] so when I shared it with him the message
[1:16:02] he believed
[1:16:05] amen Amina
[1:16:08] and that this time we are together

[1:19:01] yeah
[1:19:08] foreign
[1:19:23] [Laughter]
[1:19:51] [Music]
[1:20:01] uh Joel is uh my wife's younger brother
[1:20:07] but for the time we have been with him
[1:20:12] and I've been with him as a son as a
[1:20:15] child
[1:20:20] I gave him cancer and he listens
[1:20:24] you know when you were young
[1:20:27] you think you know everything
[1:20:29] but it's always good to take counselors
[1:20:33] and to see him graduating
[1:20:42] [Music]
[1:20:55] he graduated with a testimony
[1:21:00] with a soul
[1:21:02] and not just a song
[1:21:06] [Music]
[1:21:08] Let me let me invite him to come and you
[1:21:11] will know why I'm saying is
[1:21:20] laughs Hallelujah
[1:21:28] amen Amina
[1:21:32] I don't know what to say
[1:21:36] but um just thanking God
[1:21:41] because
[1:21:44] for sure
[1:21:46] it is God was
[1:21:48] enabled me to graduate
[1:21:54] because anger I met you all at
[1:21:57] University
[1:22:03] before meeting Joel
[1:22:06] I pray to God that
[1:22:10] I need uh friends who are
[1:22:14] who built my life
[1:22:20] because
[1:22:24] I had friends but after
[1:22:28] a level we separated and I asked myself
[1:22:32] what I benefited much and there was
[1:22:34] nothing now the name is
[1:22:43] so I pray to God as I was joining
[1:22:47] Universe
[1:22:50] give me a friend's rule for sure help me
[1:22:54] in my life because
[1:22:59] universities they told us in a level
[1:23:02] that University is a stake what is the
[1:23:05] last stage where you are leaving home
[1:23:07] and you are entering in the world
[1:23:09] University
[1:23:14] and you need
[1:23:17] to go when you are prepared
[1:23:19] away
[1:23:22] you need people who will be with you
[1:23:24] throughout
[1:23:28] so I prayed and uh God brought Joy
[1:23:32] cartoon
[1:23:36] I know it's God who brought Joel
[1:23:39] so when he came he introduced the
[1:23:42] message
[1:23:47] so good for me ways
[1:23:53] uh I came to this Fellowship
[1:23:57] I met pastor
[1:24:01] before I was coming from sofa at home
[1:24:07] University
[1:24:09] but when I when I believe the message
[1:24:15] I saw God working
[1:24:18] uh for me in various ways
[1:24:27] there was work
[1:24:31] in there in the office for picking and
[1:24:34] printing
[1:24:38] and I used to work in my heart I knew
[1:24:40] that this is good
[1:24:44] I used to remember how the distance I
[1:24:48] used to move
[1:24:51] but here it was near
[1:24:54] and the other thing I I could come to
[1:24:57] church
[1:24:59] so it was good for me
[1:25:02] and I met very many people
[1:25:07] have become part of mechanism
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:26] the for sure being there for me
[1:25:31] so
[1:25:35] Pastor said that a powerful man but uh
[1:25:40] I'm a simple man
[1:25:43] God's grace was brought me here
[1:25:54] we Face challenges in school fees
[1:26:01] God has been using pasta
[1:26:07] Martini
[1:26:09] remember brother Isaac sometimes you get
[1:26:13] discouraged you feel weak reading books
[1:26:18] [Music]
[1:26:20] but we are living together and used to
[1:26:23] encourage me
[1:26:27] so
[1:26:28] for sure they are part of me now um
[1:26:33] so I just want to thank God
[1:26:36] and you people for praying for us I
[1:26:39] remember

[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:14] I have not seen God disappoint me or
[1:30:17] cheat me at any time

[2:37:31] you
[2:37:32] know
[2:37:34] because all right now you did not do it
[2:37:38] not because you did not want to do it
[2:37:41] [Music]
[2:37:44] um
[2:37:44] I'm just requesting not to be
[2:37:46] interrupted
[2:37:48] you did not do it not because you do not
[2:37:50] want to do it
[2:37:52] because the secret language but maybe
[2:37:55] because time run out
[2:38:00] we just have
[2:38:02] 46 44 minutes
[2:38:06] I think 54 minutes
[2:38:10] and in those minutes
[2:38:14] uh
[2:38:16] and I'm waiting for you while speaking
[2:38:17] to finish because
[2:38:25] our deacons you did not time this
[2:38:27] properly I mean
[2:38:30] you're supposed to do that earlier
[2:38:32] usually when we are getting into the
[2:38:34] preaching of the world
[2:38:37] we should not we should always ensure
[2:38:39] that the preacher is not interrupted
[2:38:43] because it spoils the atmosphere
[2:38:49] and we say Amen to that mean
[2:38:53] so are we all in the same speed 100
[2:38:55] percentage
[2:38:57] of your neighbor are you in the same
[2:38:59] space

[2:39:05] of the world
[2:39:16] because I'll be a few minutes
[2:39:39] praise the name of the Lord
[2:39:42] so time run out on you or would they say
[2:39:47] in 52 minutes
[2:39:51] it will now no longer be 2022.
[2:39:57] [Music]
[2:40:11] to accomplish your goals

[2:40:19] failures have been this past year
[2:40:22] foreign
[2:40:40] [Music]
[2:41:02] and so he wanted to drink away his
[2:41:04] problems
[2:41:12] but for the children of God
[2:41:14] the way we see things is not the way the
[2:41:17] world
[2:41:21] now
[2:41:22] for the year that is coming
[2:41:27] I want I want to just give you one
[2:41:30] phrase
[2:41:32] do the best you can college is
[2:41:53] but I want to tell you something
[2:41:56] if you've not attained Christ
[2:42:00] you have lost your God
[2:42:04] because you can gain the whole world
[2:42:08] if you don't have Christ
[2:42:11] you have lost it all your numbers that
[2:42:15] is why it is important
[2:42:18] to always have and spend time with God
[2:42:23] many many people who were thought to be
[2:42:26] Mighty
[2:42:29] very last minute of their life
[2:42:33] we asked for time alone with God
[2:42:40] just one minute or two along with God
[2:42:45] what do you think that would change
[2:42:49] do you think that the Rapture
[2:42:52] is going to just happen on people and
[2:42:54] take them by surprise
[2:42:56] [Music]
[2:43:03] forget about that if you're waiting you
[2:43:07] know some of us love surprises

[2:43:12] from Ethiopia and I surprised my family
[2:43:13] and they saw me at church

[2:43:26] my wife knew that I was coming
[2:43:29] I'm not even my children they were
[2:43:33] surprised
[2:43:40] but that's not how it is
[2:43:48] Jesus is not going to surprise anyone
[2:43:52] agenda
[2:43:54] Nissan
[2:43:56] the ones who are going to be surprised
[2:44:01] but the ones who are going
[2:44:04] are already being raptured now
[2:44:08] they are being changed slowly
[2:44:14] and and The Virgins the five foolish and
[2:44:18] the five ways
[2:44:21] all of them were virgins but the other
[2:44:25] one who did not have the oil
