[48:11] pastor brother basabi has been working
[48:14] with us for many
[48:18] years anytime that we've had a
[48:23] burden whether it be translation
[48:26] printing
[48:27] books he has jumped into the Gap to
[48:30] carry on the
[48:31] [Music]
[48:33] process I say God bless you
[48:37] abundant
[48:39] amen I know him to be very diligent and
[48:42] very um
[48:46] [Music]
[48:48] resourceful and I'm sure you love him
[48:50] very
[48:52] much I want to bring you greetings from
[48:54] Canada
[48:57] our pastor brother Tom
[48:59] Ray Tom Ray and the the rest of the
[49:02] ministry at Cloverdale Bible
[49:06] Way and the church over there in
[49:10] Canada they send their greetings and
[49:12] their love to the bride in
[49:14] [Music]
[49:18] Uganda our love is not measured by the
[49:21] amount of money we spend in Uganda
[49:28] it is much greater than
[49:32] that when we get on the other
[49:35] side brother Bram said what's over
[49:39] there it is perfect
[49:44] love and there's no money over
[49:48] there praise the Lord so love is not
[49:51] measured by
[49:54] money even if we spend money to print
[49:58] books to do
[50:00] translation to carry on the work of
[50:03] God that's not what love
[50:06] is love is when the word of God is
[50:09] revealed to
[50:12] you and that's the reason that we do all
[50:15] those
[50:17] things well I don't want to spend too
[50:19] much time on
[50:22] [Music]
[50:23] introductions if you have your Bibles
[50:25] let's turn to the book of Ephesians
[50:38] your pastor wanted me to come on a
[50:43] weekend as they did in
[50:47] Ethiopia South
[50:49] Africa and
[50:51] Angola and I had to make a decision
[50:58] I only I only had one weekend to
[51:03] spare and I spent it in
[51:06] Ethiopia so then we came
[51:09] here and I said if if it's okay with
[51:12] your people I'll give you Wednesday
[51:17] night is that okay with
[51:20] you amen amen and then I'm heading up
[51:23] into the interior to visit quite a
[51:26] number
[51:30] places
[51:32] amen now as we look in the book of
[51:37] Ephesians I want to speak a subject
[51:40] tonight we'll just see how uh how the
[51:42] Lord leads
[51:46] us um we are late because of the
[51:53] traffic but let's just let the Lord have
[51:56] his way
[51:59] let's bow our heads and ask
[52:02] him Heavenly
[52:04] Father we're gathered together on this
[52:06] Wednesday
[52:09] even because we love
[52:11] you we love your
[52:13] word we need your
[52:16] revelation we want to meet with you
[52:19] tonight and Lord we didn't come to hear
[52:22] a
[52:23] man we want you to have the preeminent
[52:28] we want you to take complete
[52:31] control because you are the word that
[52:33] discerns every
[52:36] heart there is no secret that is hidden
[52:39] from
[52:40] you you know everyone
[52:45] individually there is no great one or
[52:47] little one amongst
[52:50] us but Lord you are the great one and we
[52:54] are the Sheep of your pastor
[52:58] so have your way this evening send your
[53:01] word to the hearts of your
[53:04] children for man shall not live by bread
[53:08] alone but by every word that proceeds
[53:11] out of the mouth of
[53:13] God we commit ourselves to you bless the
[53:17] speaker and the
[53:19] hearer Jesus
[53:21] Christ amen and may God visit those that
[53:24] are listening online
[53:28] amen Ephesians chapter 1 and verse
[53:32] one Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by
[53:35] the will of God to the Saints which are
[53:37] at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[53:47] Jesus all right so he's writing to those
[53:50] in
[53:52] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[53:54] Jesus
[53:57] put your name
[53:59] there he's writing to
[54:02] you Grace be to you and peace from God
[54:06] our Father and from the Lord Jesus
[54:13] Christ blessed be the God and father of
[54:16] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[54:18] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[54:21] places in Christ
[54:31] according as he has chosen Us in him
[54:34] before the foundation of the world that
[54:36] we should be holy and Without Blame
[54:38] before him in
[54:48] love when did he choose
[54:51] you was it when you
[54:55] prayed was it when you got
[54:57] baptized no before the foundation of the
[55:01] world and that's why he sent this
[55:04] message to
[55:06] you cuz he chose
[55:09] you amen next verse having predestinated
[55:13] us unto the adoption of children by
[55:16] Jesus Christ to himself according to the
[55:18] good pleasure of his will
[55:27] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[55:30] wherein he has made us accepted in the
[55:34] [Music]
[55:39] Beloved Lord add his Blessing to the
[55:41] word you may
[55:44] have now many things jump out at us here
[55:46] in the
[55:48] scripture and you'll notice verse four
[55:51] it says he chose
[55:55] us for the foundation of the
[55:58] world and verse five says predestinated
[56:01] us unto the adoption of
[56:06] children now that's the same thought
[56:08] that he he wrote in chapter eight of
[56:13] Romans those who he
[56:16] forew
[56:18] forew before the foundation of
[56:21] the who he fornew he predestinated
[56:26] to what it says here to
[56:30] adoption in Romans it says to be
[56:32] conformed to the image of his
[56:37] son so he predestinated you to
[56:41] sunship moreover whom he predestinated
[56:44] he
[56:46] called are you with
[56:48] me and whom he called he
[56:52] justified and whom he justified he has
[56:54] glorified
[56:57] and then the scripture in Romans 8
[57:00] says what sh shall we say to these
[57:04] things if God before us who can be
[57:08] against
[57:10] us amen did he choose you before the
[57:14] foundation of the
[57:16] world if God before
[57:19] you who can be against
[57:23] you and and verse six says
[57:27] to the praise of the glory of his
[57:32] [Music]
[57:35] grace I want to speak about the glory of
[57:37] his
[57:39] grace Glory when we talk about
[57:43] Glory what do we think
[57:46] about you know the Bible says Solomon in
[57:49] his
[57:51] glory you know Jesus spoke about
[57:54] Solomon and in Matthew 6 he said
[57:58] consider the lies of the
[58:02] field he says but even Solomon in all of
[58:05] his glory is not AR raay like one
[58:11] of the beauty of the
[58:14] lies he says they don't
[58:16] toil they don't
[58:19] struggle they just rest in the provision
[58:21] of
[58:23] God but they have more Glory than
[58:28] Solon see sometimes we like to
[58:32] struggle we like to
[58:34] labor rather than rest in what God has
[58:37] called us to
[58:41] be all of the glory Belongs to the
[58:46] Lord we know that no flesh will glory in
[58:48] his
[58:51] presence and even he commanded us when
[58:54] we pray
[58:56] he says Le When you pray say lead us not
[58:59] into
[59:01] temptation but Deliver Us from
[59:05] Evil for thine is the
[59:07] kingdom and the power and the glory amen
[59:12] who is the
[59:13] kingdom it's his who is the power it's
[59:18] his and whose is the
[59:20] glory it's his if there be anything good
[59:24] accomplished in our lives
[59:27] if there be anything good accomplished
[59:29] in
[59:31] Uganda if there be anything good
[59:33] accomplished in this
[59:35] church it's all to the glory of
[59:39] God we have nothing but what he has
[59:42] given
[59:44] us without him we are
[59:48] nothing and if he takes his hand off of
[59:51] us we would fall in a
[59:54] moment even brother brother Bram said
[59:57] that if he took his hand off of
[1:00:00] us he we would just
[1:00:04] fall you know John describes
[1:00:08] him in John chapter 1 he says the word
[1:00:12] was made
[1:00:13] [Music]
[1:00:15] flesh and dwelt among
[1:00:18] us and we beheld his
[1:00:22] glory now the Bible says there was no
[1:00:24] Beauty in him that we should
[1:00:29] desire so the glory was not in
[1:00:33] Beauty but
[1:00:36] character the power of
[1:00:39] God says we beheld his
[1:00:41] glory the glory as of the only begotten
[1:00:44] of the
[1:00:47] father full of grace and
[1:00:51] truth the glory of his grace
[1:00:59] amen what is
[1:01:04] Glory Glory isn't winning the World
[1:01:11] Cup I know Uganda likes uh what do you
[1:01:14] call it here
[1:01:18] football what do they call them the
[1:01:20] stars or
[1:01:22] something is that what it's called what
[1:01:24] do they call it what's the name of your
[1:01:25] your national team Uganda CR what Uganda
[1:01:29] CR okay Uganda CR all right now if they
[1:01:33] were to win the World
[1:01:36] Cup the country would be dancing in the
[1:01:42] streets come
[1:01:44] on you don't tell me you young men don't
[1:01:46] know what I'm talking
[1:01:50] about they be all
[1:01:53] rejoicing oh to the glory the soccer or
[1:01:56] the football
[1:01:59] players all the country would have a
[1:02:04] parade they would be so
[1:02:06] happy come on don't be over
[1:02:12] spiritual but that's not the glory we're
[1:02:14] talking
[1:02:17] about we're talking about the glory of
[1:02:19] the grace of
[1:02:20] [Applause]
[1:02:22] God and you are sitting here this
[1:02:25] evening
[1:02:27] in the glory of his
[1:02:30] grace you have been chosen to the glory
[1:02:33] of his
[1:02:35] grace his grace is to be
[1:02:40] glorified I'm not here because of my
[1:02:44] efforts you're not here because of your
[1:02:47] efforts you are not saved through your
[1:02:50] repentance you are saved through
[1:02:54] faith faith is a revelation from
[1:02:58] God and Christ revealed himself to
[1:03:02] you according to the glory of his
[1:03:05] grace he came to
[1:03:08] you he the Mighty God revealed himself
[1:03:13] to
[1:03:13] you he did not come down from heaven in
[1:03:16] great shining
[1:03:19] Roes but John describes
[1:03:22] him the word in the beginning was the
[1:03:27] and the word became
[1:03:29] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[1:03:32] his
[1:03:33] glory his glory was revealed to
[1:03:38] us the world couldn't see his
[1:03:41] glory the Pharisees couldn't see his
[1:03:44] glory pilate couldn't see his
[1:03:47] glory but we see his
[1:03:51] glory his glory is that he came to you
[1:03:57] that's the glory of his
[1:04:00] grace you were
[1:04:02] nobody you were born in sin you were
[1:04:05] shaped in
[1:04:07] iniquity you come into this world
[1:04:09] speaking
[1:04:10] life you had nothing to offer
[1:04:14] him but he came to
[1:04:16] you Amen to the glory of his
[1:04:20] gra you're not adding to
[1:04:23] him he's adding to you
[1:04:27] he redeemed
[1:04:28] you he has clothed you with his
[1:04:32] word not to make himself any
[1:04:35] greater he's
[1:04:37] infinite he's
[1:04:39] Eternal it's to the glory of his
[1:04:45] grace you know the devil had
[1:04:49] ideas Lucifer in heaven he had ideas of
[1:04:54] what God's glory Rec
[1:04:59] constituted brother Brown says it this
[1:05:02] way message God of this evil
[1:05:05] age he thought God dwell in worldly
[1:05:12] Beauty he did that in
[1:05:14] Heaven Sin never begin in the Garden of
[1:05:19] Eden it began in
[1:05:22] heaven when Lucifer Luci the son of the
[1:05:25] morning
[1:05:27] exalted himself in
[1:05:30] Beauty and wanted a more beautiful
[1:05:32] kingdom than that of
[1:05:36] Michel he thought that God dwell in
[1:05:41] Beauty see he thought that's where the
[1:05:44] glory
[1:05:47] was see Lucifer started a
[1:05:52] fight he thought there was glory in
[1:05:55] Conquest
[1:05:59] he tried to conquer
[1:06:00] Michael and the angels that remain
[1:06:05] steadfast he thought a battle was needed
[1:06:07] to settle the
[1:06:10] issue to him God dwelt in
[1:06:14] Beauty not in the humility that Michael
[1:06:19] expressed and there was a
[1:06:21] fight and he thought he could
[1:06:24] conquer you see he could not see any
[1:06:27] glory in humbling
[1:06:31] himself to him glory belonged in the
[1:06:35] preeminent
[1:06:39] position he had a wrong idea of God's
[1:06:45] glory he thought to be like
[1:06:49] God isn't that what Isaiah says about
[1:06:52] him he says I will sit on the sides of
[1:06:55] the North
[1:06:58] I will be worshiped like
[1:07:00] God he had a great
[1:07:03] ambition he wanted to be
[1:07:06] glorified he wanted to be lifted
[1:07:08] up but he couldn't see that the God the
[1:07:12] Eternal God Of
[1:07:14] Heaven could humble
[1:07:17] himself and make for himself a
[1:07:20] body to be born of a
[1:07:23] virgin laying in a Manger
[1:07:26] and we beheld his
[1:07:29] glory the glory of the Eternal
[1:07:33] God the word
[1:07:41] became James chapter 4
[1:07:45] says 4 and verse
[1:07:51] 6 James
[1:07:56] and it says but he giveth more grace
[1:07:59] wherefore he saith God resist the proud
[1:08:01] but giveth Grace unto
[1:08:10] the submit yourselves therefore to God
[1:08:13] resist the devil and he'll flee from
[1:08:21] you draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh
[1:08:24] to you cleanse your hands you Sinners
[1:08:26] and purify your hearts you
[1:08:40] double-minded Afflicted and mourn and
[1:08:43] weep let your laughter be turned to
[1:08:45] mourning and your joy to
[1:08:53] heaviness humble yourself the sight of
[1:08:56] the
[1:08:57] Lord and He Shall lift you
[1:09:01] up see that's the opposite of what
[1:09:03] Lucifer
[1:09:06] thought he said I will
[1:09:09] Ascend I will exalt
[1:09:12] myself I will sit upon the
[1:09:15] mountain I will be like the most
[1:09:18] high he exalted himself and he became
[1:09:23] humble and the script says humble
[1:09:27] yourself and God will lift you
[1:09:30] up amen Lucifer had the direct
[1:09:37] opposite why am I talking about
[1:09:40] Lucifer in the glory of God's
[1:09:44] grace I want you to understand that
[1:09:47] Lucifer did not understand
[1:09:50] [Music]
[1:09:52] Grace matter of fact he could not see
[1:09:54] grace
[1:09:56] even though he was going to be
[1:09:58] instrumental in the expression of God's
[1:10:04] grace see no angel can understand God's
[1:10:10] grace when we get to the marriage supper
[1:10:12] of the
[1:10:14] Lamb I think we'll all sing together
[1:10:17] Amazing
[1:10:20] Grace that saved a wetch
[1:10:26] when we sing that
[1:10:27] song brother Braham says the angels will
[1:10:30] bow their
[1:10:33] heads because they won't know what we're
[1:10:36] singing
[1:10:38] about right because the Angels don't
[1:10:40] know
[1:10:42] grace to the angels that stayed
[1:10:47] true they they didn't need
[1:10:51] grace to the angels that fell
[1:10:55] did not receive
[1:10:57] Grace see angels are ministering
[1:11:01] Spirits they're not
[1:11:04] Sons Sons are the recipient of
[1:11:09] Grace pred Grace is predestinated
[1:11:12] unmerited
[1:11:19] favor but and to God's
[1:11:22] Sons to his attributes
[1:11:26] there is Grace in the fall in the Garden
[1:11:29] of
[1:11:30] Eden we realize that there the world saw
[1:11:34] Grace for the first
[1:11:37] time when Adam and Eve
[1:11:40] sin God by Grace provided a
[1:11:45] sacrifice to come back into fellowship
[1:11:48] with
[1:11:49] them why because they had predestinated
[1:11:53] unmerited favor
[1:11:57] they were a thought in the mind of
[1:12:01] God God had chosen them before the
[1:12:03] foundation of
[1:12:05] world there was a provided way for
[1:12:09] them through Grace that's why it comes
[1:12:13] to you that
[1:12:14] way no matter where you came from no
[1:12:18] matter what happens in your life if
[1:12:21] you're a Son of God a thought of God
[1:12:24] before the foundation
[1:12:28] by Grace you are
[1:12:30] saved and that by
[1:12:33] faith not of
[1:12:35] yourselves it is the gift of
[1:12:39] God hallelujah he came to
[1:12:43] me he found
[1:12:45] me I didn't find
[1:12:47] him I didn't do anything to deserve
[1:12:51] him came by my way
[1:12:55] so it's all to the glory of his
[1:13:00] grace sometimes we we feel like we we
[1:13:03] deserve credit from
[1:13:06] [Music]
[1:13:07] God like Paul in 2 Corinthians
[1:13:11] 11 turn to it he says if I need to
[1:13:17] Glory I will glory in the things which
[1:13:20] concern my infirmities
[1:13:25] you see he says I will not glory in
[1:13:30] myself but in my
[1:13:33] infirmities now listen Paul is like many
[1:13:36] of us he says I besought the Lord
[1:13:41] Thrice take this from
[1:13:43] me Paul was a
[1:13:45] Believer he was a prophet he was full of
[1:13:49] the Holy Ghost he was the Apostle of the
[1:13:53] Gentiles he was the messenger the first
[1:13:56] age he was the example
[1:13:59] messenger he the example
[1:14:02] preacher Paul says I besought the
[1:14:06] Lord take this away from
[1:14:08] me God I Believe You're My
[1:14:13] Healer amen here's a
[1:14:16] prophet God You're My
[1:14:19] Healer my
[1:14:21] eyes bring me a
[1:14:24] Deliverance I'm going to overcome this
[1:14:26] thing I will be
[1:14:28] victorious I besought the Lord three
[1:14:31] times he
[1:14:32] said take it away from
[1:14:35] me but he said unto
[1:14:38] me my grace is sufficient
[1:14:42] for for my strength is made perfect in
[1:14:49] weakness most gladly therefore will I
[1:14:51] rather glory in my infirmity
[1:14:58] that the power of Christ May rest upon
[1:15:03] me hallelujah
[1:15:07] hallelujah the dimension that we live
[1:15:13] in
[1:15:16] time
[1:15:18] matter
[1:15:20] light was made to
[1:15:23] manifest God's grace
[1:15:29] it's different than
[1:15:32] eternity there's no Grace in
[1:15:37] heaven this is the dimension of
[1:15:43] Grace while there's no Grace in
[1:15:47] heaven Grace come from God
[1:15:51] himself to his sons his attributes
[1:15:56] expressed in their season in this
[1:16:00] Dimension so now in heaven there's no
[1:16:04] Grace this is the realm of
[1:16:07] Grace so let me ask you a
[1:16:10] question which would you rather
[1:16:13] be a perfect
[1:16:16] angel in
[1:16:18] heaven or a son of God
[1:16:25] or a son of God with all your
[1:16:32] imperfection which would you rather
[1:16:35] be you want to be an
[1:16:38] angel see sometimes on this this Earth
[1:16:41] we want to be an
[1:16:44] angel maybe I'll turn this way and
[1:16:47] pre just I'm getting just as much
[1:16:50] response
[1:17:00] which would you rather
[1:17:02] be put your name
[1:17:04] there you're an attribute of
[1:17:09] God from Mind Of God before the
[1:17:12] foundation of the
[1:17:14] world and in the mind of God for you in
[1:17:19] this realm is predestinated unmerited
[1:17:23] Grace
[1:17:28] amen give me the grace of
[1:17:31] God rather than the Perfection of an
[1:17:35] Angel let me say it again give me the
[1:17:39] grace of
[1:17:40] God rather than the Perfection of
[1:17:44] an the Apostle Paul wanted his eyes to
[1:17:49] be but God said my grace is sufficient
[1:17:52] for
[1:17:53] you give me the the grace of God give me
[1:17:57] all of his grace I want to glorify his
[1:18:01] grace that's why Paul says I will glory
[1:18:04] in my
[1:18:06] infirm Hallelujah he was caught up into
[1:18:09] heaven he saw the angels He Saw things
[1:18:13] he wasn't even allowed to
[1:18:16] speak but yet in the midst of all that
[1:18:19] says if I
[1:18:22] Glory I won't Glory about that
[1:18:25] I'll glory in my
[1:18:28] weakness hallelujah hallelujah that
[1:18:30] God's strength might rest
[1:18:36] upon now in the church age
[1:18:40] book The the message to the lateran
[1:18:45] age are you in that
[1:18:48] age you were born in that age you're
[1:18:52] called into a bride age
[1:18:55] but you were born in
[1:18:57] Le all right and it says unto the angel
[1:19:00] of the Church of the
[1:19:03] Le these things sayith the
[1:19:06] amen the faithful and true
[1:19:09] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:19:14] God oh if I could I could preach on that
[1:19:16] last statement for the next three
[1:19:21] hours the beginning of the creation of
[1:19:24] God
[1:19:26] but brother Bram takes it in the church
[1:19:28] age
[1:19:32] book Jesus is giving us this description
[1:19:35] of
[1:19:38] himself in relationship to the last
[1:19:43] age the days of grace are winding
[1:19:50] up Grace is coming to an end
[1:19:55] when the last member of the Bride Comes
[1:20:00] in these mortal bodies will be
[1:20:04] changed they'll become
[1:20:07] immortal we'll be United with our
[1:20:09] heavenly
[1:20:10] bodies and then there's no more need for
[1:20:14] Grace he says he has looked from the
[1:20:18] first century right through to the 20th
[1:20:20] century
[1:20:25] and has told us things concerning the
[1:20:29] ages before he reveals the
[1:20:31] characteristics of the last
[1:20:36] age you know the
[1:20:39] characteristics I am rich increase
[1:20:43] with that's this
[1:20:46] age he gives us one final look at his
[1:20:49] own gracious and supreme deity
[1:20:58] this is the Capstone revelation of
[1:21:07] himself that's his message to the
[1:21:10] lastage a final
[1:21:13] look at
[1:21:17] Grace a full
[1:21:20] revelation of Grace and supreme deity
[1:21:26] or if I can say it this way the grace
[1:21:29] and the sovereignty of
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:34] God he will not lose
[1:21:37] one he chose you it's his
[1:21:41] choosing it's not our choosing it's his
[1:21:45] Cho he will ensure that you make
[1:21:49] it blessed is the man to whom God will
[1:21:51] not impute iniquity
[1:21:56] God has a plan of redemption in his
[1:22:01] thoughts and remember this Plan of
[1:22:05] Redemption is to the glory of his
[1:22:10] grace he chose you he predestinated you
[1:22:14] to
[1:22:15] sunship to the glory of
[1:22:19] his are you with
[1:22:21] me unseen By Angels
[1:22:25] manifested in Son of God sons of
[1:22:30] God
[1:22:32] Amen Let me let me take you a little bit
[1:22:34] further
[1:22:36] here I'm going to try and hold restrain
[1:22:39] myself here
[1:22:44] tonight I know what it's like in Africa
[1:22:46] you all have to make your way home in
[1:22:48] the
[1:22:52] dark so let's just focus ourselves
[1:22:56] stay with me I'm going to shift
[1:22:59] gears I'm going to move into a higher
[1:23:02] gear all right so let's let's go Ephesus
[1:23:06] Church
[1:23:08] AG there were two trees in the Garden of
[1:23:12] Eden both of these trees had a
[1:23:14] relationship to
[1:23:17] man or they never would have been placed
[1:23:21] there they must have had a part in the
[1:23:23] sovereign plan and purpose of
[1:23:29] God or we could never impute omniscience
[1:23:33] to
[1:23:36] God in other words God put two trees in
[1:23:39] the
[1:23:40] garden a
[1:23:43] purpose amen he
[1:23:48] says that life could not and would not
[1:23:52] be shared in any other way than the way
[1:23:55] of God manifested In the
[1:24:03] Flesh all right I'm getting ahead of
[1:24:06] myself
[1:24:08] here but this is on page 102 of the
[1:24:12] church age
[1:24:15] book you read it when you go
[1:24:18] home brother Bram takes the scripture
[1:24:21] that we read in Ephesians
[1:24:25] and then he takes Revelation
[1:24:27] 133 and he says all on the Earth shall
[1:24:30] worship
[1:24:32] Satan whose names are not written in the
[1:24:34] Book of
[1:24:37] Life of the lamb slain before the
[1:24:39] foundation of the
[1:24:42] world then he says that
[1:24:45] life what life the life of the
[1:24:49] Lamb could not be shared any other way
[1:24:55] that God manifested in
[1:24:59] flesh that was part of his eternal and
[1:25:02] predestinated
[1:25:07] purpose then he says this
[1:25:10] plan is to the praise of the glory of
[1:25:13] his
[1:25:15] [Music]
[1:25:17] grace it's a Plan of
[1:25:20] Redemption it's a Plan of Salvation
[1:25:25] and then he then he says right in the
[1:25:27] book he says now listen
[1:25:31] closely God being a
[1:25:34] savior it was necessary that he
[1:25:37] predestinate a
[1:25:40] man predestinate a
[1:25:44] man to that would require
[1:25:51] salvation in order to give himself
[1:25:56] reason and purpose of
[1:26:01] being let me let me sum it up for
[1:26:05] you you needing
[1:26:09] salvation is the purpose of his
[1:26:14] being
[1:26:19] Hallelujah he says thus what God worked
[1:26:22] out here in the garden was his pred
[1:26:24] destinated
[1:26:30] plan and when Satan had brought about
[1:26:33] that which was
[1:26:37] necessary to the purpose of
[1:26:41] God then man could not get to the Tree
[1:26:44] of Life In The
[1:26:48] Garden then there would come a
[1:26:52] day when God would appear in the
[1:26:57] flesh and by means of his
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:03] humiliation see that's what the devil
[1:27:05] couldn't
[1:27:06] understand he thought the way to
[1:27:08] overcome was to
[1:27:11] conquer
[1:27:13] battle fight that's why a church fight
[1:27:17] is never to the glory
[1:27:21] of are you with me
[1:27:24] but the devil thought
[1:27:26] that but he couldn't understand
[1:27:29] that but brother Ram says God would
[1:27:31] appear in the
[1:27:33] flesh and by means of his
[1:27:38] humiliation the most humiliating
[1:27:42] death treated in the most humiliating
[1:27:47] Way by means of his
[1:27:51] humiliation he would restore Fallen
[1:27:55] man and make him a partaker of that life
[1:28:03] eternal hallelujah
[1:28:05] hallelujah we we say that he's a savior
[1:28:08] and there therefore something needed to
[1:28:10] be
[1:28:13] saved but let me put it to you another
[1:28:16] way you couldn't even be lost if he
[1:28:19] wasn't a
[1:28:22] savior let me me say it again you
[1:28:25] couldn't even be lost if he wasn't a
[1:28:30] sa the reason you were
[1:28:33] lost is because he's a
[1:28:37] savior and that gives him purpose of
[1:28:41] being to the glory of his
[1:28:45] grace so let me take it
[1:28:49] further you couldn't even be sick unless
[1:28:51] he was a Healer hey
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:58] Glory now now we want to
[1:29:02] shout that's why Paul said I will glory
[1:29:04] in my
[1:29:08] infirmity it's to the glory of his
[1:29:12] grace so next time you're
[1:29:16] sick or those of you that are homesick
[1:29:20] tonight your your pastor spent a good
[1:29:22] part of the day in bed today
[1:29:26] because he was sick but let me just say
[1:29:30] that when you're laying there
[1:29:32] sick you just say Lord this is because
[1:29:35] you're a
[1:29:42] Healer Hallelujah that's the true
[1:29:45] revelation of the word of
[1:29:48] God to the glory of his grace
[1:29:54] amen
[1:29:55] amen the first time Grace was expressed
[1:29:58] as I said was in the Garden of
[1:30:03] Eden in
[1:30:05] Eden God's
[1:30:07] attributes had to come to their full
[1:30:13] expression it might seem like Creation
[1:30:16] in its
[1:30:19] Perfection the Garden of Eden Adam and
[1:30:23] Eve communicating with the
[1:30:26] animals an amateur God on the
[1:30:29] earth that might seem like that's
[1:30:33] glorious but there was a hidden Glory
[1:30:35] that was not yet
[1:30:39] expressed the Redemptive purpose of
[1:30:44] God to the glory of his
[1:30:47] grace hallelujah hallelujah God had laid
[1:30:51] the plan out
[1:30:55] and when Satan accomplished what God
[1:30:57] wanted him
[1:31:00] to bring about the
[1:31:03] fall because only through the
[1:31:06] fall could God Express his
[1:31:11] grace Hallelujah Abel had a revelation
[1:31:14] of
[1:31:17] that he had a greater Revelation than
[1:31:20] Cain
[1:31:22] did it was to the glory of the grace of
[1:31:27] God it wasn't fig
[1:31:30] leaves it wasn't man's
[1:31:33] effort see Cain thought he could worship
[1:31:35] God by
[1:31:36] [Music]
[1:31:38] effort a beautiful
[1:31:40] altar a beautiful Church a beautiful
[1:31:44] form of
[1:31:45] worship but Abel
[1:31:47] knew it's his
[1:31:49] grace a god provided a blood sacrifice
[1:31:53] by
[1:31:56] and Abel worshiped
[1:31:59] God by the
[1:32:02] Revelation to the glory of his
[1:32:05] [Music]
[1:32:08] grace man Liv then for 2,000
[1:32:14] years and then they arrive at the time
[1:32:16] of
[1:32:18] Noah and it it uh repented the Lord that
[1:32:21] he made man on the Earth
[1:32:25] it grieved him at his
[1:32:27] [Music]
[1:32:28] heart and God said he would destroy the
[1:32:33] Earth we've come to just before another
[1:32:40] destruction I'm not a political
[1:32:43] man but they just had an election in the
[1:32:46] United
[1:32:48] States I thought if that woman gets
[1:32:52] elected we're headed to World War
[1:32:56] I but it seems like God's will was that
[1:32:59] Trump would get
[1:33:03] elected so maybe he spared us a little
[1:33:06] bit more
[1:33:08] time why there's more work to be
[1:33:13] done there's more seed to come
[1:33:16] in there's more bride to be
[1:33:20] mature it's not about politics
[1:33:24] it's about God's Redemptive
[1:33:28] purpose there's more grace to be poured
[1:33:33] out and Noah when he lived in his
[1:33:38] day the time finally came for
[1:33:43] Destruction but Noah found Grace in the
[1:33:46] eyes of
[1:33:48] Lord hallelujah hallelujah when is we
[1:33:51] living this last day
[1:33:53] when the world is heading into a
[1:33:56] tribulation I don't want
[1:33:59] works I don't want to present anything
[1:34:01] I've
[1:34:02] done I just want to find Grace
[1:34:10] in it was Grace of God that provided the
[1:34:15] ark Noah that preacher of
[1:34:20] righteousness he preached the
[1:34:22] flood he preached
[1:34:25] destruction he preached
[1:34:27] rain but the same Reign that destroyed
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:32] world saved eight
[1:34:36] Souls amen the Bible says that in First
[1:34:39] Peter
[1:34:41] 3 eight Souls were saved by
[1:34:45] water it was the grace of
[1:34:49] God hallelujah hallelujah brother bradam
[1:34:53] says
[1:34:54] every time the messengers went
[1:34:57] forth brought a
[1:35:00] message of Love Grace and
[1:35:05] deliverance God's message has always
[1:35:08] been a message of
[1:35:11] Deliverance before
[1:35:14] judgment this message to the last
[1:35:17] days is rapturing
[1:35:20] Faith what is that Deliverance Before
[1:35:26] Destruction there's coming a destruction
[1:35:28] on the
[1:35:31] Earth but God sends a
[1:35:34] message to build you up into rapturing
[1:35:39] faith that will be caught up together
[1:35:41] with the resurrected
[1:35:44] Saints to meet the Lord in the
[1:35:49] air he says Noah had a deliver had
[1:35:52] Deliverance
[1:35:56] lot had
[1:35:58] Deliverance though it was a message of
[1:36:02] Deliverance people turn it
[1:36:05] down it's mercy and
[1:36:08] deliverance and people turn it
[1:36:10] down you know don't turn down this
[1:36:14] message this is the final message to the
[1:36:16] final
[1:36:19] age I don't know if somebody tonight is
[1:36:21] hearing this message for the first time
[1:36:26] we're coming to the finishing the final
[1:36:29] time of God's
[1:36:33] grace don't turn down God's
[1:36:38] grace it's God's grace that he sent us a
[1:36:41] message of
[1:36:44] Deliverance like Abraham in the city of
[1:36:48] Earth who is
[1:36:50] Abraham
[1:36:51] nobody just a normal
[1:36:55] doing a normal
[1:36:56] job but God sent a message of Grace
[1:37:00] to and by faith we are the children of
[1:37:05] Abraham his life was a story of
[1:37:09] Grace God chose him to the glory of his
[1:37:15] grace God spared Sarah to the glory of
[1:37:21] his God had a plan
[1:37:24] Sarah will have a
[1:37:26] son and Abraham was ready to to give her
[1:37:32] up imagine sisters if you had a husband
[1:37:34] like
[1:37:37] Abraham the King was interested in his
[1:37:41] wife so what's Abraham's
[1:37:44] response I'll fight to my
[1:37:47] death no he said just say you're my
[1:37:51] sister
[1:37:55] I don't think there's any sister wants a
[1:37:57] husband like
[1:38:02] that amen
[1:38:05] sisters he wouldn't even protect
[1:38:09] her what kind of a man was he he was
[1:38:13] God's chosen
[1:38:15] man the glory of
[1:38:19] Abraham but to the glory of God's Gra
[1:38:24] hallelujah
[1:38:26] hallelujah Grace sent Israel a
[1:38:31] deliverer Grace provided them a
[1:38:34] prophet when they needed a
[1:38:37] Deliverance God sent them
[1:38:39] Moses it was his
[1:38:41] grace he didn't ask them to figure out
[1:38:44] how to get
[1:38:48] delivered
[1:38:50] Propet he said a deliverer
[1:38:53] God didn't ask you to figure out the
[1:38:59] Rapture he sent you a
[1:39:01] prophet he sent a
[1:39:04] deliverer God sent Israel a rock when
[1:39:07] they needed
[1:39:10] water God sent them Mana when they
[1:39:12] needed
[1:39:14] food by Grace but still they wanted a
[1:39:19] law where there's no Grace in the law
[1:39:24] the law brings you into
[1:39:28] captivity but Grace sets you
[1:39:33] free why would people choose a
[1:39:37] la choose God's
[1:39:41] grace why would people choose dos and
[1:39:45] don'ts in the
[1:39:51] message exctly
[1:39:54] that's exactly the way you say
[1:39:56] it do this don't do
[1:40:01] that when God is offering you
[1:40:07] his you want to know how to get free of
[1:40:09] the
[1:40:11] world get more of
[1:40:13] Christ get more of his
[1:40:16] gra more of him in
[1:40:19] you less of the world
[1:40:25] because he has chosen
[1:40:28] you to the glory of his
[1:40:32] grace he chose you not to the glory of
[1:40:36] your
[1:40:38] efforts not to the glory of your
[1:40:41] pastor not to the glory of your
[1:40:44] church but to the glory of his
[1:40:51] grace Hallelujah
[1:40:55] Grace provided us a
[1:40:59] savior to redeem the attributes of
[1:41:04] God he paid the price 2,000 years
[1:41:10] ago and ascended to his father's
[1:41:14] throne and then when John saw him in
[1:41:17] Revelation
[1:41:19] 5 he was called The Lion of the tribe of
[1:41:22] Judah
[1:41:25] the
[1:41:25] ruler the King the lion of the tribe of
[1:41:30] Judah and John says I turned to see the
[1:41:35] lion and I saw the grace of
[1:41:39] God I saw a lamb as it had been
[1:41:44] SL he is the
[1:41:46] lion is the
[1:41:48] ruler he's come forth in our
[1:41:51] day with the book
[1:41:53] open to bring you back to your
[1:41:57] right but what do you
[1:41:59] see do you see a
[1:42:02] lion or do you see a
[1:42:04] lamb John saw a lamb as it had
[1:42:08] been lamb took the
[1:42:10] book The Lamb Loos the
[1:42:14] seals the lamb brought us back to our
[1:42:19] in to the glory of his grace
[1:42:24] no wonder John fell
[1:42:26] down and worshiped the
[1:42:28] lamb and the elders fell
[1:42:31] down and worshiped the
[1:42:33] lamb and the four beasts fell
[1:42:37] down think about it the four beasts fell
[1:42:41] down and worshiped the
[1:42:43] lamb not the
[1:42:45] lion the
[1:42:48] lamb hallelujah hallelujah they
[1:42:51] rejoice and they they they sang a new
[1:42:56] song Thou Art
[1:42:58] Worthy to take the book and open the
[1:43:02] seat all right I'm going I'm going in
[1:43:05] seven different directions here we
[1:43:08] go why did John
[1:43:11] Rejoice because it was the opposite of
[1:43:13] the reason that he cried I didn't get it
[1:43:16] it was the opposite of the reason that
[1:43:17] he
[1:43:22] cried wept because no man in earth or
[1:43:25] under the Earth or in heaven was found
[1:43:30] worthy brother Brown said why did he
[1:43:33] weep his name was on that
[1:43:36] book your name was on that
[1:43:39] book if it remained
[1:43:42] sealed Redemption couldn't be
[1:43:47] finished if it remained
[1:43:49] sealed you'd never know who you were
[1:43:53] there had to be a revelation of what's
[1:43:55] on the
[1:43:57] book what's on the book the sons of God
[1:44:01] the attributes of God chosen before the
[1:44:04] foundation of the
[1:44:06] world to the glory of his
[1:44:09] grace now Romans 8
[1:44:12] says that all of
[1:44:14] creation even this
[1:44:17] creation
[1:44:18] groans waiting
[1:44:20] for the King James says
[1:44:23] manifestation of the sons of
[1:44:29] God but the word manifestation isn't
[1:44:31] actually
[1:44:35] manifestation because it's in the Greek
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:44] apocalypsis in Revelation 1 and
[1:44:47] one says the revelation of Jesus Christ
[1:44:53] the apocalypsis of Jesus
[1:44:58] Christ so the revelation of the
[1:45:01] sons or the manifestation of the
[1:45:04] son is actually the revelation of the
[1:45:12] sons so then what is the revelation of
[1:45:14] the
[1:45:15] sons where is the
[1:45:17] mystery of the sons of God it's on the
[1:45:21] Lamb's Book of Life
[1:45:24] when is it
[1:45:25] revealed in this
[1:45:27] day all of
[1:45:29] creation has been groaning for this
[1:45:33] message
[1:45:35] Hallelujah this is the revelation of the
[1:45:38] sons of
[1:45:42] God Revelation one says the revelation
[1:45:45] of Jesus
[1:45:47] Christ stay with me whom he did
[1:45:51] predestinate he whom he forew he did
[1:45:56] predestinate all right whose name was on
[1:46:00] the
[1:46:03] book what
[1:46:05] book you mean God has a book in
[1:46:08] heaven how many pages does it
[1:46:11] have what's it made out
[1:46:14] of is it
[1:46:16] paper is it
[1:46:18] parchment is it lamb
[1:46:20] skin what's it made out of
[1:46:24] no book is a
[1:46:26] symbol Book of Revelation is a book is a
[1:46:29] book of
[1:46:32] symbol so what is written on the
[1:46:34] book the attributes of
[1:46:37] God not just a minute where are the
[1:46:40] attributes of God they're in the
[1:46:43] thoughts of
[1:46:44] God so the thoughts of God were sealed
[1:46:50] up the thoughts of God were sealed with
[1:46:52] Seven
[1:46:55] Seals but the lamb paid the
[1:46:58] price to unseal the thoughts of
[1:47:03] God that the thoughts of
[1:47:06] God the attributes of
[1:47:08] God you and I could be
[1:47:13] revealed because whom he
[1:47:16] fornew those in the book those in his
[1:47:20] thoughts he did predestinate
[1:47:23] to be conformed to the image of his
[1:47:27] son but what is the image of his
[1:47:30] son it's the revelation of Jesus
[1:47:34] Christ and that Revelation is
[1:47:37] here seals are off the
[1:47:40] book to reveal who you always
[1:47:47] were because you got to come to the
[1:47:51] revelation of Who You Are
[1:47:53] are it's got to be revealed to you
[1:47:58] personally so God opened the
[1:48:01] book to the glory of his
[1:48:03] grace that you might see
[1:48:06] yourself that you might see
[1:48:09] yourself the way that God sees
[1:48:13] you not the way the devil sees
[1:48:17] you the devil says you're a
[1:48:20] nobody the devil says you're you make
[1:48:23] too many
[1:48:24] mistakes the devil says you got all
[1:48:26] kinds of
[1:48:28] troubles the devil says there that
[1:48:30] there's nothing good
[1:48:33] about just like he did about
[1:48:35] Job God said Satan have you considered
[1:48:38] my servant
[1:48:41] job and the devil says take your hand
[1:48:44] off him I'll make him curse
[1:48:48] you but God saw job for what he was
[1:48:54] God sees you for what you
[1:48:58] are the trials he sends
[1:49:02] you the things that you go through is to
[1:49:06] prove his thinking about
[1:49:16] you correct
[1:49:19] thinking
[1:49:21] Hallelujah those who he
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:24] forew he knew you
[1:49:27] before and God's thoughts cannot
[1:49:31] change his thoughts are
[1:49:34] Eternal it always
[1:49:36] were and he has his Perfect
[1:49:40] Bride without spot or
[1:49:43] wrinkle
[1:49:45] orish or any such
[1:49:47] thing are you that
[1:49:49] bride if you're that bride now
[1:49:53] you always were that briide and you
[1:49:56] always will be
[1:49:58] that and nothing the devil can do can
[1:50:01] stop
[1:50:03] it so God sends his
[1:50:06] message to wash you in the water of the
[1:50:11] world you always were a perfect
[1:50:15] brde sends his
[1:50:18] message to wash your
[1:50:21] thoughts and let put in you the thoughts
[1:50:24] of
[1:50:27] God hallelujah
[1:50:30] [Applause]
[1:50:35] amen it's
[1:50:38] Grace oh let me just go a step further
[1:50:41] are we
[1:50:44] okay says to the praise of the glory of
[1:50:46] his
[1:50:49] grace then it says wherein he has made
[1:50:52] us accepted in the
[1:50:58] Beloved but beloved is not actually the
[1:51:00] right word in
[1:51:03] English all right it's it's a form of
[1:51:10] Agape all right there's three forms of
[1:51:15] agap love love
[1:51:18] projected and the recipient of the love
[1:51:31] all
[1:51:32] right but but this word is not agapetos
[1:51:35] which is
[1:51:39] actually this word is
[1:51:43] AAP love
[1:51:46] projected all right so he has made us
[1:51:50] accepted in the projected love
[1:51:53] [Music]
[1:51:59] but now go step
[1:52:02] further and say accepted is not the
[1:52:05] right
[1:52:07] word this is
[1:52:10] amazing because the words what they
[1:52:12] meant when they were translated mean
[1:52:14] different things
[1:52:19] today if we did a literal translation
[1:52:26] that would this word accepted would be
[1:52:32] graced all right to the praise of the
[1:52:35] glory of his
[1:52:39] grace wherein he has graced you with
[1:52:42] projected
[1:52:48] love what is Grace predestinated
[1:52:51] unmerited
[1:52:56] favor now here it is man's
[1:53:00] thinking denominational
[1:53:03] thinking is if you believe you will be
[1:53:10] accepted but the truth of the word of
[1:53:13] God is you are already accept
[1:53:19] Hallelujah and therefore you believe
[1:53:26] hallelujah amen hallelujah wherein he
[1:53:29] has made his
[1:53:30] acceptance
[1:53:40] hallelujah amen brother Bram says you're
[1:53:43] going to the wedding in the
[1:53:47] sky you're wearing the wedding band of
[1:53:49] predestinated unmar Grace
[1:53:57] a wedding band of
[1:53:59] Grace unmerited of your
[1:54:03] own God did it
[1:54:05] himself he knew you before the
[1:54:09] foundation so he slipped the wedding
[1:54:12] band on you
[1:54:19] there not here
[1:54:22] before the foundation of the
[1:54:27] world brother Adam says a wedding
[1:54:30] band represents
[1:54:33] something it's it's round and it has no
[1:54:38] ending because it represents
[1:54:42] eternity an eternal
[1:54:46] Union and this is the message invisible
[1:54:49] Union
[1:54:52] slip the wedding band on you before the
[1:54:55] foundation of the
[1:54:59] world then he says he put your name on
[1:55:03] the
[1:55:05] book The Wedding Band of predestinated
[1:55:08] unmerited
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:14] Grace so then when the book is
[1:55:17] open it's to the glory of his grace
[1:55:23] hallelujah
[1:55:25] hallelujah I'll bring you one more quote
[1:55:27] and then we'll
[1:55:31] close from this is out of the paman
[1:55:34] church
[1:55:37] age from a little group of the true seed
[1:55:42] of the
[1:55:44] word God will present Christ with a
[1:55:48] beloved bride
[1:55:52] she is a virgin to his
[1:55:56] word she's a virgin because she knows no
[1:55:59] man-made Creeds or
[1:56:05] dogmas by and through the members of the
[1:56:11] Bride will be the fulfilled all that was
[1:56:17] promised by God to be manifested in the
[1:56:21] virgin
[1:56:24] The Word of Promise came to the Virgin
[1:56:29] Mary but that Word of Promise was he
[1:56:34] himself to be
[1:56:37] manifested God was made
[1:56:40] manifest he himself acted at that
[1:56:44] time and fulfilled his own
[1:56:48] word in the
[1:56:50] Virgin it was an angel that brought her
[1:56:53] the
[1:56:55] message but the Angel's message was the
[1:56:57] word of
[1:57:00] God all right then he goes on I skip a
[1:57:04] little bit he goes on here is the secret
[1:57:06] of
[1:57:07] this the word is in the bride as it was
[1:57:11] in
[1:57:15] Mary the bride has the mind of Christ
[1:57:22] sometimes we just think that's
[1:57:26] Doctrine no it's God's thinking of
[1:57:32] you you are that
[1:57:35] virgin if you know if you're a virgin it
[1:57:38] means you're not tied up with man's
[1:57:40] Creeds and
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:44] dogas you've been brought to the perfect
[1:57:48] word and you believed it showing you
[1:57:51] where the
[1:57:53] virgin the one with the ring on your
[1:57:56] finger a predestinated unmar
[1:58:01] Grace and that word being revealed to
[1:58:04] you shows you who you
[1:58:07] are and that eliminates Creeds and
[1:58:12] dogmas it does a away with man's
[1:58:15] thinking it does a away with the devil's
[1:58:18] thinking cuz the devil thought he could
[1:58:21] cause job to
[1:58:27] stumble the devil doesn't believe you're
[1:58:30] the
[1:58:31] bride but God knows you're the
[1:58:36] bride because he sent his word that can
[1:58:39] only be received by the
[1:58:43] bride the word is in the bride as it was
[1:58:47] in
[1:58:50] Mary Mary said
[1:58:53] it unto me according to Thy
[1:59:02] word not my will but thy will be
[1:59:07] done that
[1:59:10] sunship that's what Jesus prayed in the
[1:59:15] garden Mary didn't ask for
[1:59:18] the for the word or the manifestation of
[1:59:21] the word in her
[1:59:27] ideas could you just wait till Joseph
[1:59:30] and I are
[1:59:32] married could it just come at a
[1:59:34] different
[1:59:36] season no the word came to
[1:59:39] her and she said be it unto me according
[1:59:42] to your
[1:59:45] word she didn't know
[1:59:47] how she didn't understand the mechanics
[1:59:49] of
[1:59:50] it but she met an
[1:59:53] angel God said his Angel to
[1:59:56] you with a message a Vindicated Prophet
[2:00:01] to tell you what God thinks about
[2:00:03] you I say be it unto me according to Thy
[2:00:09] word all right last
[2:00:12] quote when God made the first
[2:00:15] man he made the heavens and the
[2:00:18] Earth and God St back stood back on the
[2:00:22] old creation and looked upon
[2:00:25] it he didn't look upon it to judge
[2:00:29] it he looked upon it and said how good
[2:00:31] it
[2:00:33] is he admired
[2:00:35] it all right that was the first
[2:00:40] creation he says but now Satan perverted
[2:00:45] that but if God could not condemn his
[2:00:48] first creation
[2:00:54] how much more is it impossible to
[2:00:56] condemn his second
[2:01:03] creation when you are created a new in
[2:01:06] Christ
[2:01:09] Jesus what's the message to the latest
[2:01:12] in
[2:01:14] age this is from he the beginning of the
[2:01:17] creation of God
[2:01:22] you are the creation of God in Bride
[2:01:28] form amen when you are created a new in
[2:01:32] Christ
[2:01:34] Jesus you can't do it
[2:01:37] yourself no matter how much you want
[2:01:40] to you can't do it it's a gift of
[2:01:46] God no man can come to me except my
[2:01:49] father draws
[2:01:53] and all that comes to me I'll give him
[2:01:55] everlasting
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:58] life and raise him up at the last
[2:02:02] day now
[2:02:04] listen when God has borne you a new by
[2:02:08] the Holy
[2:02:12] Spirit that's the new
[2:02:15] creation so now here's what he says he
[2:02:19] can only look upon you as a perfect work
[2:02:28] am because he did it
[2:02:33] himself amen that's why
[2:02:36] religion with works the law of D
[2:02:41] ands all of those man-made dogmas and
[2:02:45] Creeds will never be considered a
[2:02:48] perfect
[2:02:50] work adding something to the New
[2:02:54] Birth when God gives you the New
[2:02:58] Birth by the Holy Spirit he can only
[2:03:01] look upon you as a perfect
[2:03:06] word because he did it
[2:03:10] himself he can't condemn
[2:03:14] you that ought to make you
[2:03:18] jump he can't condemn you
[2:03:21] are his
[2:03:24] workmanship cuz then brother brandham
[2:03:27] said I feel like shouting like a
[2:03:31] Methodist Hallelujah think of
[2:03:34] it you are God's
[2:03:37] workmanship he did it by
[2:03:40] how Sovereign
[2:03:43] Grace not because you
[2:03:46] jumped not because you went to
[2:03:49] church not because you turned a new page
[2:03:53] but because God in his
[2:03:56] Mercy brought you into
[2:04:00] Christ and to
[2:04:02] fellowship and looks upon you as a
[2:04:04] perfect work of his
[2:04:10] own you are God's
[2:04:16] [Music]
[2:04:17] workmanship so let me say in closing
[2:04:22] quit believing the devil's
[2:04:26] Lies when God looks at
[2:04:29] you he sees the
