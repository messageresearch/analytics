TRANSCRIPT
========================================
so you find a lot of young people they are not willing to do what they they ought to do actually what they advised to do but they think that prayer is going to make it like magical that's that is what religious religion has done to people okay because that's not Christianity yeah Christianity also teach you that uh ecclesiastic n whatever you find yourself to do do it with all your might all your soul with all your ability and that's why our Prophet also taught us yes whatever you want to do be the best out of it yeah even if you make up your mind to be a criminal be the best criminal criminal not a mediocre don't come halfway on it that's that's the attitude so and if you want to be a Christian be a good kind of Christian don't be Halfway Christian you know become an incubator chicken Christian people must follow you up call you every time to come to church chur throw yourself into it yeah that's right when w Braham prayed about his sick situation and was asking God he said God if I die I will come to heaven and I will tell you I trusted you and I died M so what does that mean he believed God with all his heart with no reservation M so I had a attitude why I why I make this story is that so you can we can go back to the prophet word when John just speak he speak by inspiration yes that is our attitude that bring result exactly but many of us is that we are living in a generation of irresponsibility where people want to um nobody want to accept responsibility people just want to abortion blame transfer responsibility to other people you don't have good reason to explain why they didn't do anything believing that that reason is enough no reason actually people don't know the war the word poor MH it's not about people who lack mhm check your West po po means unproductive the word poor is not about people who lack things people that are refer to poor people and people who are not productive when you are not productive then the word poor is refer is is referred to you exactly so God created a man to be a manager mhm God created a man to work mhm if you read your Bible gen Genesis 1 after Genesis 1 to the end then Genesis 2 was the application of Genesis 1 Genesis 2:4 said the eight was filled with rock no Beauty nothing nothing is functional MH because why there was no human being mhm man was the motivation of beauty mhm until God created man then water came from the ground then Garden was developed so the first thing God did is he took a man he made Genesis 2:15 and put him in the garden and said cultivate it dress it make it beautiful protect it m so man was made to walk this is before fall this is before the fall so walk is not a cause but many of us do not know the difference between work and a job because I believe they look like the same but they are not exactly the same yeah okay your job is what they pay you for what you do but your work is what you are born to do MH your job can never make you weldy MH it has limitation in making you wealthy what makes you wealthy is your work mhm you go to your job to learn your work mhm when you go to your job in the morning you come back in the evening and start practicing your job your your work M because job in job they pay you salary M salary is a medicine for poverty but it doesn't cure it so is there connection between work and purpose there is a work is actually purpose exactly work is actually purpose the reason actually you can call it devotion the reason why you were born if you find it that is purpose a natural word even establishment that are purposely driven are much more successful than the ones that profit driven MH if you pursue purpose mhm you will achieve success because when you fulfill purpose this is the reason why you are created and that's why people everybody must not be a doctor everybody must not be a lawyer every if God call you to to to sing just go there and sing like and actually you stop working when you find your purpose yeah when you operate in your purpose you don't do it with any stress yeah because it's like fish to water yeah just swis when fish is swimming he walking but his wing doesn't pain him when bir is flying he's walking but his wind also never pays him so when you find your purpose of existence you stop working you is something you love to do and by doing it the result will be so evident because you are in your purpose of life yeah it just comes natural it come natural so when I tried all of those things it was life was rough and hard tough difficult because this was before Nigeria Civil War which year are we talking about here we are talking about like 19 uh Nigeria civil war broke out uh I think 1960 either 62 or 63 I'm not very sure but Nigeria had this independent in 1960 it wasn't long soon after that I think by 65 or the the the civil war broke out okay and I was still a young man you know little boy uh you know you it's something you don't wish for anybody to see where you see J fighter come dropping bomb in people house we ran under the bunker people could not go to farm to fish we have to it's about survival we ate every anything that is moving to be able to to leave but I have sheer determination that if there's one person that will be alive and survive so it's all about determination we made in ourself that's why when I teach principle I tell people the first thing you need to bring on the table with God is desire mhm you must have desire mhm because your desire is like your egg mhm the jam the seed come from God but that seed will not fall on anything if a woman make love with her husband if she doesn't drop egg she can make love as many time as possible no thing will germinate those egg will die so the egg has to be there for the seed to come into it and you see life is created so that desire will be there so and that's why Jesus in mark 11:24 say whatever you desire you believe you receive it and you will have it so desire it come first then the the promise come on it so you need to have that and that desire is what I call hunger and we have a we have an issue here uh I've seen it myself and many have actually even told to me directly when young people desire things let's say big things or they want to achieve certain things in life our society you know will just people will will talk words to you say well you're over ambitious you're overly ambitious you are proud you know instead of encouraging and many young people just then just stay back and you know and leave everything to fet okay so that is the um that is um very important uh point you have made there but I would like us to balance it and what do I mean by I want us to balance it the reality is that the way God want us to live even though we adult is to live like little children a little child do not know fear God want us to live a Fearless life we are not born with fear we learn fear fear is something we learn as we grow up if you find a child in his innocent level and I I actually tell parents today I teach people if you really want to know naturally who your child is wash him from the age of two to five if that child is a born Chef he will go to the sand and putting sand together to make like he's cooking if he's a born um doctor you see him taking something putting in Pap because what he is is manifesting naturally because that's what he was born to be by the time he's getting to the age of8 or nine his father is a lawyer father said go to school and learn law you can make money from law all these things doesn't make money then the boy the father decided to live his life through his own child the boy will go and learn law law but he will never win any case in the court because anytime they say something he's looking for book he never get inspiration nothing speak back to him the only book his father forc him to become a doctor because his father is a doctor because you're a doctor your son must be a doctor it doesn't work like that yeah you fish can never climb a tree yeah are you feel what I'm saying yes so allow the children to grow naturally parents many time are dream Killers we parents kill the dreams of our children but the truth also is that if you many time it's a diff a it's really a difficult thing to explain but I told people problem many times is opportunity in life MH because the word crisis in Chinese language actually means opportunity M when you talk about crisis in China not like in the direct interpretation ofr in China is opportunity okay you can goog you can Google it so anything you think is an obstacle m is an opportunity MH if my father is alive I did not believe my father could have allowed me to do some of the things I did mhm at my teenage that brought me to where I am mm so my father's de supposed to be a hindrance but I turned it into opportunity I knew there are things my children wanted to do that I stopped them my last boy wanted to drive motor bike I said please stop that you break your leg you cannot do that what stop stop but I drove motorbike at the age of 11 I was not 12 when I drove motorbike yeah my only son who drive motorbike out of my four boy is the one who disobeyed [Laughter] me are you get are you get what I'm yes but today both of us go out to go and ride bike and you enjoy together yeah we we I'm a biker I have BMW 1,600 so he has Suzuki uh 1,300 we go out now and rad back and we are the only two people road bike in my family but he's able to ride back by disobedient many time you will never find Road without missing road yeah that's right if you keep on following a road that has been taught to you you will not discover new road that's right so you need sometime you need to miss road yeah you may get to the end and you find out there's no Road there you come back it's a experience yeah you've gained experience and people ask me why do you say this thing don't you know this thing will confuse young people I said life is not about what all that you are taught you must have inspiration M if my father was alive he will never allow me to marry under 20 years H because it's it's not in our tradition so I break tradition for you to do something new you break tradition mhm William Braham did not force himself to see he was born a SE MH and his brethren in Baptist Church said this is devil you can what do you say you see because we don't see here what do you say you are seeing we don't believe any such thing you don't believe such thing stop it and he kned down start praying God I don't want evil spirit please take this away from me but the gift and calling of God is without repentance so he couldn't do anything about it so if you are too guided micromanaging people you don't get to see the people fully actualize themselves so sometime we must also allow our young people to make their mistakes because that's part of learning
