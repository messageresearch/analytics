[54:32] verse 15.
[54:36] is
[54:51] come here let's do it
[54:56] love not the world
[54:59] neither the things that are in the world
[55:03] if any man love the world the love
[55:06] of the father is not in him
[55:16] a month
[55:24] for all that is in the world the last of
[55:27] the flesh
[55:28] the lust of the eyes and the pride of
[55:31] life
[55:31] is not of the father but he is of the
[55:34] world
[55:45] to be very
[55:49] and the world passes away
[55:53] and the last they arrow but hey
[55:57] that do with the will of god abides
[56:00] forever
[56:12] but i wanted to look at it again it says
[56:14] and the world
[56:16] passes away
[56:27] did you hear that is your maturity can
[56:30] every one of you tell your neighbor the
[56:31] world passes

[57:52] three
[58:00] [Applause]
[58:07] so i would like to uh request for your
[58:10] undivided attention
[58:15] i know it is quite difficult for us to
[58:18] have online chats
[58:23] because when you are in the church here
[58:25] there are deacons or people who usher
[58:27] you and
[58:27] they kind of watch you your behavior and
[58:30] so they make sure that everything is
[58:31] is is going well come on
[58:45] it is usually quite difficult for you to
[58:47] be attentive
[59:31] second thing through h.o.k
[59:34] and while i am speaking on these
[59:35] subjects i have the young people
[59:37] at heart
[59:42] but also the older ones alike
[59:47] these things are affecting not only the
[59:50] younger ones
[59:51] but both the old and the young alike
[59:58] these three
[1:00:06] [Applause]
[1:00:27] in these three things
[1:00:31] that's why my subject is these three
[1:00:34] things
[1:00:38] and on sunday last we spoke on the last
[1:00:41] of the flesh
[1:00:45] this sunday of this morning i'd like us
[1:00:48] to speak on the last
[1:00:49] of the eyes
[1:01:00] he emphasizes and he says the things
[1:01:02] that he says love not the world
[1:01:04] again neither the things that are in the
[1:01:08] world no one converted
[1:01:10] into every demon so there are many
[1:01:11] things in the world and again someone
[1:01:13] will simulate injuries
[1:01:17] are the things that are in the world
[1:01:22] so which means that there are people who
[1:01:25] can be in charge
[1:01:26] but having the love of the world
[1:01:32] they can be in church but they are
[1:01:35] loving the things that
[1:02:16] [Music]
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:23] what are the things that are in the
[1:02:24] world the lust of the flesh
[1:02:28] will be the last of the eyes and the
[1:02:31] pride of life

[1:03:51] [Applause]
[1:03:52] because i know i will abide forever
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:24] but
[1:04:37] is that thing which you last after but
[1:04:39] when the origin of that last is from
[1:04:41] your body from your flesh
[1:04:52] and now
[1:05:09] by the end of the service you may
[1:05:11] realize that many of you might have been
[1:05:13] somehow
[1:05:14] somewhere at one point in your life or
[1:05:16] maybe even now
[1:05:17] overtaken by the last of the eyes
[1:05:28] some people think the last of the eyes
[1:05:30] is only
[1:05:32] only the fornicators have it
[1:05:48] and i'll begin reading the with a
[1:05:52] i'll begin with this uh quote from the
