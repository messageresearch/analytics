[music] How long are you as long [singing] as I am? [music] I will always worship [singing and music] you. [music] Hallelujah. Thank you. Worship him with your lifted up hand and [music] speak to him tonight. It's a night of worship. It's a night of prayer. How many just need the Lord to just come and minister to them tonight? [music] Would you please just now begin to enter into my presence? Nothing else matters but his presence. If only we can be able to enter into that presence, then all things become possible. Our desires committing them to him. Our needs committing them to him. You know, the most dangerous thing is to to have religion but have no Christ. You can be able to go to church. The devil can let you do that. You can be able to sing. The devil may not hinder you. But entering into his presence is one thing. the devil would try his best to hinder you to stop you. So whenever you have a moment like this when you are not at your home, you've not come, we've not come here to see one another. We have come because we have a hunger and a thirst for to hear from a living God. have contact with him that he may speak to us and we may hear from him and we may tell him our hearts and so when you come in his presence walk into that shakina glor [snorts] and the reason why we sing is to draw his presence that he may come. See when his presence [music] comes down then we are bound to hear from him. When the word comes in such a presence in such an atmosphere there's nothing that is impossible because he has come down. Would you now close your eyes for just a moment and begin to connect with him, the Holy Spirit, let him draw nigh unto thee as you draw nigh unto him. Brother Shalom, I wonder if you can help us sing that song, draw me, Lord. Draw me, Lord. There's a run after thee. &gt;&gt; Draw me Lord. &gt;&gt; Let us sing this song from our hearts if we can. &gt;&gt; Oh, draw [singing and music] me Lord. Oh, draw me [music] Lord and I after [singing and music] you. Yes. Around &gt;&gt; and I run after you. [music] &gt;&gt; after [singing] you. &gt;&gt; Yes. Draw me. Oh, [music] draw [singing] me. Draw me. Oh, [singing] draw me Lord. Oh, draw [music] [singing] me, Lord. And around after [music and singing] Yes. Around [music] you, [singing] Lord. Around [music] [singing] I [music] tell you, Lord, draw me. Oh, draw [singing] me [music] Lord. Hallelujah. [singing] [music] Lord, as you well Jesus, [singing and music] [music] [singing] after [music] you [singing] die. [music] Oh, after you, Lord. &gt;&gt; [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Sing one last time. [singing] Oh, just tell him now. Close your eyes. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; God daddy [singing] [music] [music] [singing] after you. After [music and singing] you. Now, [singing] oh [music] you I'm running Lord. [singing] &gt;&gt; I'm desperate for you, [music] Lord. I run [singing] [music] after [singing] you. Welcome, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; We [singing] are in your presence. Feel us tonight, Lord. &gt;&gt; Feel us. [singing] Help us, Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; In these few moments in your presence tonight, Lord, feel us, Lord. [music] &gt;&gt; Feel us, Lord. Feel us, Lord.

[singing] Help us, Lord. &gt;&gt; Fill [music] us with your power. Power [music] your power [singing] live inside [music] of me. Sing one more time. Welcome Holy Spirit.

Come into my heart, Lord Jesus. [music] Come in today. coming to stay [music] to [singing] my heart. Lord Jesus, [music] let us pray. Father, in the name of Jesus, we have come to you tonight. Lord, we have no other desire. But Lord, our desire is that you may come into our heart. Father, you may not only come to visit us, but you will come to stay. You come to accomplish your work which you have started in our lives. We are not here by accident, but we are here by design. You knew us and chose us in you before the foundation of the world. And Lord, we are here to be made manifest. We are here, Lord, to be unveiled to the world and to overcome whatsoever the enemy brings our way. Now Lord as we yield ourselves to you tonight Lord yet again for another moment another session where you'll come and bring your word of life father Lord may you touch each and every part of our lives tonight. May your word oh God of glory be a revival in our soul that at the end of this service we will say into our hearts burn within us as he ministered as he spoke to us. Grant it father it's our desire prayer in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. The Lord bless you saints good evening. Amen. Amen. Tell your neighbor good evening. Nice to see those of you who uh have finally made it tonight. It's usually a blessing to be in his presence. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. I don't want you to be absent minded. When I'm speaking, I'm speaking to you each of you, not you as a group. The Lord is speaking to you. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. Let us turn to the book of Numbers, chapter 13. We'll read from verses 26. To those in the media department, this is just a continuation of what we've been talking about. Just pay attention to the verses. We're reading from 26 to 33. &gt;&gt; Uh brother, maybe we'll try to read verse by verse. We see how it will go. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they went and came to Moses and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Peron, to Kadesh, and brought back word unto them, and unto all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. And they told him and said, "We we came unto the land whether thou sentest sentest us, and surely it flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. Nevertheless, the people be strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are w and very great. And moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. The Amalachites dwell in the land of the south, and the Hittites, and the Jebsites, and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. And steal the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are able to overcome it. But the men that went up with him said, "We be not able to go up against the people, for they are stronger than we." And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel, saying, "The land through which we have been uh we have gone to search it is a land that eatth up the inhabitants thereof, and all the people that we saw in it, a man of a great stature. Baby, And there we saw giants, the son of an sons of Anch which come of the giants and were in our own sight as grasshoppers. And so we were in their sight. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Father, we have read a portion of your word tonight. We ask your grace once again as we take a few moments to speak Lord on this word. reveal it to us. May your Holy Spirit come and help us that these will not just be words written but your spirit will be applied upon them and that you will accomplish your work in our lives for myself to everyone here Lord and the interpreter as well. Help each of us Lord that are streaming by the way of the internet. May you just minister to each one Lord in Jesus mighty name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you saints. You may be seated. &gt;&gt; Um to those of you streaming and you're supposed to be here. Just want to always encourage you to come to church whenever you can. And those of you who are here, tell your neighbor, God bless you. Thank you for coming to church. Amen. Some people are not hearing what I'm saying. Touch your neighbor and just tell them, you know, don't be timid. Where the spirit of God is, there is liberty. Yes. So uh before we go into the word tonight, I just wanted to say pastor Simon Cay is arriving tonight. Um he he he must be still flying as I I'm speaking to you now. And uh you know this is someone who has really sacrificed a lot to come all the way from New York. He's a pastor there. And so he's mainly coming for Karamoj as I told you on Sunday. So he's arriving tonight and then tomorrow early in the morning. We will be uh starting the the road trip for this convention is in Cot this year. And so uh we are trying to make it try to see if we will make it possible to stream the service. So brother is is going with us as well and you so pray it will be possible. Sometimes you want to do it but it depends on the equipment that they have there and all that. But uh those of you who if we if it is possible to stream then you will you try to tune in because I want you to hear for yourself because I told you oh brother sister has a good ministry. So when if you hear then you will know what I was saying. So after we're going to be there throughout the weekend. Um, and then we'll be here. So before he flies away, I think on could be on the same day we'll try to have him on on a Wednesday, the Lord willing. So would you remember that in prayer? Amen. And there are many traveling as well and many traveling back and others traveling back. So we should also remember brother uh brother Brian Sometimes the names keep my mind. Brother Brian is going to be traveling to his in-laws. Brian, &gt;&gt; I just thought I should I should make that public. So, as a church, I'd like us to remember him in prayer that God will give him traveling masses and also give him favor before their eyes. Amen. And also we we have this convention that has been always organized in the in in the uh Buganda Masaka sub region and I um I don't so they called me up and wanted us to send one of our ministers here and they specifically wanted brother brother Julius to go and and help. You know they usually just invite young ministers to minister to young people. They thought that brother brother Julius would bless them. So we as a church want to stand behind that and send him down there willing he might go with brother shalom. Shalom. &gt;&gt; So it will be on the 18th. Uh no I think is it 29th through the new year. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So that is going to be uh 29, 30th, 31st through the new year fast. They'll be back on on the second and then of course that following Sunday we have brother Michael here. It's a busy season but we are going to be enjoying a lot of ministry. Let us try to not miss any service. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So tonight we are just going to continue and I I promised that I would speak a little bit on Kadesh Beradesh. How many know what Kadesh ban is? All right. So now we've been following the story. Very interesting story. For a while now we've been talking about the journey of of the Israelites. as you know going to the promised land and mainly our subject has been talking about vision and when we talk about vision you know we've been trying to take vision and connect it to the will of God season and the time because when God wants to you know do something I remember when we first talked about this subject, we read Amos 3:7 that surely the Lord will do nothing but he reveals his secrets to his servants, the prophets. If God wants to do something in any age or season, what he does is he picks a man and then he gives him a mission. He sends him out. But this man is only going to carry out the vision. His mission or his assignment would be to accomplish the vision. So in other words, we can call him the vision bearer. So the vision bearer is the one that has the understanding of the will of God for that season. Not meaning that the spirit of God cannot come upon others. He can, but in a specific way. He gives this man that he has chosen or picked up the woman or whatever it is. And then he anoints them with the word of the hour. He anoints them with the word of the season. And he this man or this woman would be would then be the vision bearer. OF THE VISION OF God for that season for that group of people and if anyone comes against them they will be out of the will of God and so we've taken it in different directions and we talked about a church a local church like this one how God lifts up a man called a pastor and you know we've talked about you know as each of us as individuals how we must choose which church we attend. We are given the liberty to do that. And how when you have chosen a church where you're going to be uh um uh as your home church, then you must 100%, let me put it this way, 200% believe in the vision of that pastor OF THAT CHURCH. AND WE SAID IF you don't it's time to find another church because that pastor if you don't believe in him he cannot do anything for you spiritually and also you cannot be helped. So then you must have confidence in that man and then God will use him for your spiritual life. And I read you a quote where brother Bham said he is ordained of God to lead you through. Now it does not mean that that man will be perfect. But you still leave his imperfections to God. And if you believe he's a man of God for you then you believe in his leadership. You believe in his guidance. You believe in his teaching. And in this life, God will use him to lead you. Praise the name of the Lord. This is the message of the hour. And now we also talked about the man of God for a generation. Because you see a pastor, we have many pastors. And every pastor is sent to a local assembly. And every pastor must have an assignment. You must have a vision for that local work, for that local vision, for that local area, you know. And and and and so God does that. You know you cannot assign somebody. God cannot assign somebody to go out without giving him a vision. But in the same way we also realize thank you brother Enoch. So we also realize that God will send a prophet in a generation. In the same way you know you cannot raise up two people three or four in the church and he gives them the vision for the church. That's why brother Bham completely asserts that the church is not led by a board of directors or it's not even led by a board of deacons but it is led by the Holy Spirit and the word and God places that man there and he inspires him. He he he guides him using the word and the Holy Spirit and then he uses that lead us as a congregation. I'm not amazed how God does things. But then also in a generation, God has not raised up a a a A A BOARD OF pastors or a school of prophets that each of them will bring their opinion and the body of Christ will be led. The vision OF A GENERATION, GOD GIVES it to one man called a prophet, the prophet. of the age. And the prophet of the age is a vision bearer. Listen, you need to understand this and I I'll continue with this subject until we all catch it. Just like IN THE LOCAL CHURCH WHERE the pastor is the vision bearer, BUT HE'S NOT the only minister. You see, in the local church, YOU WILL HAVE THE five-fold ministry. All of it may not be in one local church but it's in the body of Christ anyway. What I'm saying in a local church you have teachers you have you know apostles you have you know evangelists you have but also you have the nine spiritual gifts and all these are ministering to the body. But in a local body like here like DVA for example, you have one pastor that God has chosen and given the vision for that local body and and and and you know but there are also other ministers. But you see those ministers should not come in another spirit or in another vision. Do you understand? They have to MINISTER IN THE SAME SAME VISION. That's why you must never if you're a preacher, you must never submit yourself to a ministry, to a local MINISTRY WHERE YOU DON'T understand the vision of that man. You see, that's why we have a lot of political maneuvers IN CHURCHES. YOU FIND THEM, YOU KNOW, FIGHTING AND one will come and put will say this, another one will come and say this, ANOTHER ONE WILL SAY THIS. So they leading the church INTO LIKE 10 DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. And that kind OF CHURCH WILL ALWAYS BE CONFUSED. PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS FIGHT. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE DISAGREEMENTS. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE GOSSIP. THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MISUNDERSTANDINGS. BUT THEN THE VISION IS LOST. BUT YOU SEE A CHURCH THAT IS GROWING that is proceeding in the vision OF THE AGE OR IN THE VISION THAT God has given them. YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY WILL ALL DESIRE TO KNOW WHAT IS the vision that God has given to our pastor. WHAT IS HE TEACHING? WHAT YOU MUST KNOW WHAT your pastor believes on every subject. What does he believe on women hair? Does he is he okay with women cutting THEIR HAIR? WHAT DOES he believe on dressing? WHAT DOES HE BELIEVE ON WATER BAPTISM? WHAT DOES HE BELIEVE ON THE GOHEAD? WHAT does he believe ON THE SEVEN? WHAT DOES HE BELIEVE? YOU MUST KNOW. YOU MUST KNOW. DON'T FOLLOW BLINDLY. THE PROBLEM PEOPLE ARE ARE replacing the word with religion, the spirit with RELIGION AND THEY GET STUCK. THAT'S WHY PEOPLE CAN FOLLOW ANYTHING. DON'T FOLLOW ANYTHING. KNOW WHAT YOU BELIEVE. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE YOU ARE STANDING WITH. KNOW WHAT YOU'RE STANDING BEHIND. Because if he that is leading you IS BLIND. Even you even if you think you are seeing you are blind. The Bible says the BLIND LEADING THE BLIND THEY ALL BOTH fall where? Into the deep. And then you have a problem in our generation. The people who don't want to be led. You find they don't HAVE A HOME CHURCH. believers but they don't have a home church. They keep brother says they keep floating from pillar to post every Sunday IN ANOTHER CHURCH. YOU ASK HIM WHAT IS YOUR CHURCH? WHERE DO YOU PAY YOUR TITHE? WHERE DO YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE? THE CAUSE, THE VISION WHERE THEY DON'T KNOW BUT YOU KNOW THEY ARE BELIEVERS. SUCH PEOPLE ARE VERY DANGEROUS. YOU SEE AND you can you should never marry SOMEONE LIKE THAT. GETTING MARRIED to someone, YOU MUST KNOW WHERE THEIR CHURCH, they must have a local body of believers, where they call their home. Because let me tell you, I'VE SEEN IT, YOUNG PEOPLE GETTING MARRIED. AND AFTER A WHILE, they have problems, but there is no one you can go to talk to about that person. HE WILL LISTEN TO NOBODY ANYMORE. HE WILL ONLY SAY, "WELL, I LISTEN ONLY TO GOD." So then what are you going to do? YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONFUSED. YOU MUST have a pastor. You must be led. You must submit to authority. Amen. That's what we believe. You have a believer, you should say, "Amen." BUT THEN IN A GENERATION, we also HAVE A PASTOR. I CALL HIM A PASTOR. BECAUSE IT'S A VISION bearer for the entire AGE ALL OVER THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; THAT you know these things are very hard to swallow for some but it is Bible order. You see God calls one man AND HE INSPIRES HIM AND HE GIVES HIM A THE VISION FOR THE ENTIRE GENERATION. WHAT IS IT IS THE WILL OF GOD FOR THE PEOPLE LIVING IN THAT AGE. We have seven ages. Amen. The last one is Ladyia. NOW THIS ONE GOD SENT A PROPHET AND HIS NAME IS WILLIAM BRAN. NOW HIS MESSAGE amen reveals THE VISION OUR VISION IN THIS AGE. WHAT IS THE VISION of our age? IS THE COMING OF THE LORD. WHAT'S THE VISION OF THIS AGE? IS VAIN IN THE BRIDE. BUT YOU SEE, YOU CANNOT KNOW THIS MESSAGE FROM ANYWHERE ELSE. OR ROBERT WAS A SERVANT OF GOD. BILLY GRAHAM IS A SERVANT OF GOD. BUT THEY CAN NEVER SHOW YOU THE VISION OF THIS AGE. is only with a vision BEARER of the age. So you should KNOW WHO YOU ARE FOLLOWING. AMEN. And thank God we have received the message of this age. Amen. To say brother Bam is the prophet OF THIS AGE DOES NOT MEAN THERE ARE NO OTHER PREACHERS. THAT'S A MISUNDERSTANDING. THERE ARE ALSO OTHER PREACHERS. I am one of them. There are many others. There have been many others. You know, for for now 50 years. And if the Lord tries, WE HAVE MANY MORE. GOD IS STILL CALLING. HE'S STILL ANOINTING. HE'S STILL SENDING OUT MEN TO TAKE THIS MESSAGE. But you see, if God calls you in this dispersion, amen, to preach this message, you will not preach another message. You will stay in the vision. That's what brother Bam said meant WHEN HE SAID STAY IN THE LINE. STAY IN THE LINE. MEANING STAY WITH THE VISION OF THIS AGE. What is the VISION OF THIS AGE? IT'S NOT ONLY HEALINGS of the people. No, NO, IT'S NOT ONLY MIRACLES AND SEVEN. NO, the vision of this age IS THE RAPTURE IS THE CALLING OF A BRIDE, IS THE UNVEILING OF THE BRIDE, IS THE UNVEILING OF THE BRIDEGROOM AND THE BRIDE, YOU KNOW. SO, WHAT IT WHAT IS IT DOING? IT IS GATHERING THE BRIDE UNTO THE BRIDEGROOM. IT'S A UNITING TIME. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MESSAGE IS FOR OUR BODIES TO BE CHANGED. IS FOR US TO BE REDEEMED TO WHERE WE CAME FROM. THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE MESSAGE. IN OTHER WORDS, THAT'S THE VISION of our generation. The rest is all details. So if you are a preacher and you are called to preach in this dispensation, if you are staying in the vision, you will stay, you'll preach that. Now we see Israel for the next few moments we can try to use it and go through it a little bit. Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan. And they said unto them, "Get you up this way, southward, and go up to the mountain." You see, he's the man with a vision. Now he's telling them, you know, you cannot just walk into the promised land. I want to send 12 men. They didn't sit down as a committee to decide. Moses was led of the Lord and he said, "You know what? I'm sending 12 men." and and Moses sent him out. He said, "Now go." AND AND HE EVEN TOLD HIM WHERE TO GO. HOW DID HE KNOW? GOD WAS SHOWING HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YOU KNOW, YOUR PASTOR always has hidden manner. Amen. THE PROPHET OF THE AGE HAS HIDDEN [screaming] MANNER FOR OUR GENERATION. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You see, and see the land, AND SEE WHAT IT IS, AND THE PEOPLE THAT DWELLETH THERE IN, WHETHER THEY BE STRONG OR WEAK, FEW OR MANY, AND WHAT THE LAND is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad, and what cities they beh that they dwell in, whether in tents or in strongholds. Amen. Brother Calib, I I I don't want my voice to get bad again. I'm going to a conversion. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And so then now what what is he trying to say? Someone who has issues may come and begin quoting Moses and we saw them. You see, BECAUSE MOSES TOLD THEM, GOD HAS TOLD ME THAT I'M TAKING ALL OF YOU TO A LAND THAT IS GOOD FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY. AND AT THE SAME TIME HE SAYS GO SEARCH OUT THE LAND. See if it is good or bad. If it is evil or good WHETHER PEOPLE ARE GIANTS or they are many or they SMALLER THAN YOU. SO SOMEONE CAN QUOTE HIM AND SAY YOU EVEN SEE MOSES WAS NOT [screaming] SURE. MOSES WAS THINKING MAYBE THEY THE LAND IS BAD. [screaming] AND THAT'S WHY WHEN THE 10 SPIES CAME BACK, THEY ALL HAD BAD TESTIMONY. They might even have called Moses. So God ALLOWS THE MESSENGER TO SAY SOMETHING TO [screaming] KNOCK OFF SOME PEOPLE. AMEN. SO EVERYTHING IN THE MESSAGE IS SAID [screaming] OF THE LORD FOR OUR GENERATION. AMEN. AND SOME THINGS WHICH WERE SAID, THEY WERE SAY FOR SOME OTHERS TO STUMBLE. AMEN. BUT BLESSED ARE YE. IF YOU CANNOT STUMBLE, BLESSED ARE YE WHO WILL RECEIVE EVERY WORD OF GOD FOR your generation. And he will receive it as thus sayith THE LORD. And what the land is, whether it be fat or clean, where there be wood there in be of good courage and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first uh first first ripe grapes. And so they go there and as they went they you know they come back and the Bible says and uh they went and came to Moses and to Aaron at all the congregation of the children of Israel. Amen. into the wilderness of par to Kadesh &gt;&gt; and brought back word unto them and unto the congregation and showed them the FRUIT OF THE LAND. THIS IS CHURCH REMEMBER WHERE ARE THEY NOW? They are very few meters or kilometers to enter canon. They just You can call the gate of can. This is where Kadesh was, you know, and and they were JUST ABOUT TO ENTER. BUT YOU SEE, THEY JUST WANTED TO BE SURE WHERE THEY WERE GOING. How was it? And Moses sent the spies. And the spies came back and they told him with all the people there, you know, we have always we have very many people like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. Anything. LISTEN CHURCH PASTOR. WHAT IS WHAT do you mean by political maneuver? ANYTHING ANYWHERE [screaming] ANY ACTION THAT IS DONE OR SAID BEING DIFFERENT FROM THE vision is a political maneuver BECAUSE IT DID NOT COME FROM GOD. IT originated from men. That's why CHURCH WE MUST NEVER ALLOW ourselves to be led by our own feelings, BY OUR OWN IDEAS. BY OUR OWN THOUGHTS. THE CHURCH IS NOT LED BY MEN. THE CHURCH IS LED BY THE HOLY GHOST AND BY THE WORD. EVERY MAN. THE PASTOR MUST HEAR FROM GOD. THE PEOPLE MUST HEAR FROM GOD. ALL OF US TOGETHER AS A CONGREGATION. WE MUST BE LED BY GOD. GOD HAS A WAY. HE LEADS. GOD HAS A CHANNEL. HE USES A MAN WHO CARRIES THE VISION. HE USES A PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THE VISION AND THEN THEY RUN WITH IT. So you see here these people they came back. They were trusted. They were sent and then they went into this promised land and they came back and they said we came to the land where you sent us. And surely it flows flowth with milk and honey. AND THIS IS THE FRUIT. NEVERTHELESS, whenever you see that thing, just know now political maneuvers are beginning. Yes, I know the WORD SAYS THIS, but always run away from that kind of spirit. I KNOW THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, BUT CLOSE YOUR EARS. I KNOW BROTHER BAM THE PROPHET SAID THIS BUT [screaming] CLOSE YOUR EARS. AM I PREACHING TO SOMEONE TONIGHT? I KNOW THE PASTOR PREACHED LIKE THIS. [screaming] BUT WHAT ARE YOU SAYING? JUST SAY AMEN. THE PASTOR SAID THIS IN THE WORD. AMEN. THE WORD SAY THIS. AMEN. THE PROPHET SAY THIS. AMEN. DON'T DOUBT. DON'T QUESTION. AMEN. &gt;&gt; But these ones they said, "Yes, &gt;&gt; we have seen the land. It is strong with me. Here's the fruit to prove it. Nevertheless, the people they are strong and the [clears throat] cities world and the very great. MOREOVER, WE SAW the children of Anarch, the Amalachites, they dwell in the land of the south. The Hittites, THE THE JEBITES, THE AMORITES, THEY DWELL IN THE MOUNTAINS. AND THE CANONITES, THEY DWELL BY the sea and by the coast of Jordan. They were still talking about this gibberish, gibberish, gibberish. Let me tell you, brothers and sisters, when God SPEAKS TO YOU, AMEN. IT MEANS he's ready and he is able to accomplish the promise he has given. Amen. If God says through through the prophet messenger under no circumstance should I BELIEVE. DON'T say it is impossible. BUT I KNOW BROTHER SAID THIS. WHY ARE YOU SAYING B? LEAVE THE B. SAY IT IS HARD. I SAY AMEN TO YOU. THERE IS NO B. AMEN. But these people here, they are saying but a LOT OF BATS. THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT THE AMERICAN LAND IS GOOD. But the LAND IS GOOD. THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT THE AMORITES, THE LAND IS GOOD. AND LASTING. THE LAND IS GOOD, BUT HATRED. THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT MY DESIRES, THE LAND IS GOOD. BUT MY NEIGHBORS, THE LAND IS GOOD. DON'T YOU THINK BEFORE [screaming] GOD TOLD YOU ABOUT THE LAND, HE KNEW ABOUT THE JEBUSITES, THE AMERICANS, THE AMORITES. HE KNEW ALL OF THEM, BUT HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT THEM BECAUSE THEY SO INSIGNIFICANT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] &gt;&gt; GOD KNEW YOUR WEAKNESSES. GOD KNEW THE SINS THAT EASILY BESET YOU. [screaming] BUT HE NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT. HE TALKED ABOUT THE LIE. HE TALKED ABOUT THE PROMISE. WHY? [screaming] BECAUSE HE KNEW ALL THESE OTHER THINGS ARE REALLY INSIGNIFICANT. THE PROMISE MUST ALWAYS COME TO PASS. WHAT [screaming] GOD SAYS MUST HAPPEN. WHAT GOD PROMISES MUST BE FULFILLED. [screaming] STOP LOOKING AT YOUR GENOCIDES, AT YOUR RIGHT. AMEN. BECAUSE THEY ARE SO INSIGNIFICANT. THEY DON'T MATTER. HALLELUJAH. LET ME HAVE SOMEONE SHOUT. AMEN. [screaming] YES, SIR. the Anakites, the Hittites, THE CANONITES, IT DOESN'T MEAN a thing. And here is a man that had caught the vision. Amen. Tell your neighbor, catch the vision, brother. Catch the vision, brother. Catch the vision, BROTHER. [screaming] OH, God bless you, brother. Amen. We have over here and over there. Praise God. AND STILL THE PEOPLE before Moses and said, "Oh, let us go together and possess it." I love said, "Let us go up at once. Let us go up at once. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether I'm talking to Calbs &gt;&gt; or I'm talking to the 10 spies. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, brother. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let us go up at once. Amen. You people, you better BE ON FIRE. STOP BEING COLD. CATCH THE VISION. LET US GO UP AT ONCE. [screaming] LET US GO UP AT ONCE. AMEN. But they said we CAN'T TAKE THE LAND. THE LAND IS OURS. THE PROMISE CAME THROUGH OUR PROPHET MESSENGER. &gt;&gt; OH MY. &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL ANOINTED to say right now? GOD PROMISED US LAND EVEN AS A CHURCH. AMEN. AMEN. YOU REMEMBER THE VISION I CAME AND TOLD YOU HERE SAID WE SHALL GET IT. LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS, WE ARE HALFWAY THERE. WE ARE GETTING THE LAND. LET THOSE WHO DOUBT DOUBT. BUT GOD SAID IT, GOD WILL ACCOMPLISH IT. THERE IS ANOTHER PART. I SAID THERE'S ANOTHER PART. THOSE ONES WHO HAD THE REVELATION AND THEY BEGAN POWERING HIM, POWERING IT LITTLE BY LITTLE. ARE YOU HERE? LITTLE BY LITTLE. I SAY THIS AS YOUR PASTOR NOW. AS YOUR PASTOR I AM ANOINTED TO TELL YOU PREPARE FOR YOUR OWN BLESSING. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I AM NOT JUST EXCITED. I AM STANDING IN [screaming] THE WORLD. I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. PREPARE FOR YOUR OWN WAY. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. YOU CAN'T FAKE THIS. YOU CAN'T MAKE THIS. YOU DON'T PRAY FOR A BLESSING. YOU [screaming] DO WHAT GOD SAID DO AND THEN WATCH WHAT WHETHER HE WAS FULFILLED OR NOT. CALB STEAL THE PEOPLE BEFORE MOSES AND HE SAID, "LET US GO UP AT ONCE AND POSSESS HIM, FOR WE ARE WELL AABLE, WE ARE WELL ABLE TO OVERCOME." HALLELUJAH. BUT THE MEN THAT WENT UP WITH HIM, they said, "We be not able to go against the people for they are stronger than we. Don't you think KNEW THAT? &gt;&gt; DON'T YOU THINK JOSHUA KNEW THAT? BUT THE BIBLE SAYS THEY BROUGHT UP AN EVIL REPORT of the land which THEY HAD SEARCHED UNTO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL, SAYING, "The land through which we HAVE GONE TO SEARCH, IT IS THE land that Edth in Pharaoh and all the people THAT THAT WE SAW IN IT ARE MEN OF GOD. AND THERE WE SAW GIANTS AS SONS OF ANARCH WHICH COME OF THE giants and were in our we WERE AS GRASSHOPPERS IN THE SIGHT. &gt;&gt; Let me TELL YOU DON'T DESPISE YOURSELF. HALLELUJAH. They were thinking THEY WERE TOO SMALL. THEY WERE THINKING THEY CANNOT ACHIEVE THIS PURPOSE. THEY WERE THINKING THE VISION IS TOO GREAT FOR THEM. BUT REMEMBER, IT WAS NOT THEIR VISION. IT WAS GOD'S VISION. MAN HAS A VISION. GOD HAS A VISION. MAN HAS A PROGRAM. BUT ALSO [screaming] GOD HAS A PROBLEM. AND THE PROGRAM OF MAN WILL ALWAYS FAIL. BUT [screaming] GOD IS PROGRAM NEVER FAIL. LET ME TELL SOME OF YOU. I AM A PROJECT OF GOD. YOU ARE A PROJECT [screaming] OF GOD. GOD IS BUILDING YOU. GOD IS MAKING A GIANT OUT OF YOU. YOU MAY NOT SEE IT NOW, BUT RATHER YOU ARE BIGGER THAN YOU KNOW. GOD HAS GIVEN YOU A VISION THAT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN YOU ARE BECAUSE HE THAT IS IN YOU IS GREATER THAN HE [screaming] THAT IS IN THE WORLD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LET ME SAY THIS ALSO. GOD DOES NOT WORK WITH MONEY. GOD COMMANDS MONEY TO WORK FOR YOU WHEN HE NEEDS IT. BUT GOD DOES NOT NEED MONEY TO WORK. THAT'S WHY I TOLD YOU ON SUNDAY AND I MEANT IT AS FAR AS THE MINISTRY is concerned. AMEN. WHATEVER GOD INSPIRES ME TO DO, I START ON IT. I ANNOUNCE IT. I I PLAN ON IT WHETHER I HAVE THE MONEY TO DO IT OR NOT. AND LOOKING BACK YEARS, NONE OF IT HAS EVER FAILED. As long as I did it by inspiration IN THE MIDDLE, MANY TIMES I HAVE QUESTIONS MYSELF. WAS THAT GOD? IS IT THE WILL OF GOD? SHOULD I STOP? SHOULD I QUIT? YOU SEE, WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS, YOU KNOW. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BROTHER. IF GOD INSPIRES YOU, GOD SPEAKS TO YOU, NEVER DOUBT HIM. BECAUSE IT'S A GOD THAT NEVER FAILS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. HE TOLD THEM, "GO AND TAKE THE LAND." BUT THESE OTHER 10 SPIES, THEY SAID, "THESE men are so greater than we are. WE ARE SMALL AND THEY'RE BIG. WE WERE LIKE GRASSHOPPERS. IT DOES NOT MATTER. You may be like a grasshopper. Amen. When you compare yourself on THE VISION, BUT BROTHER, SISTER, BROTHER, SISTER, HAVE FAITH IN GOD. HAVE FAITH IN GOD. DO NOT let anything obscure the vision from yourself. DON'T LET PEOPLE TALK YOU OUT OF THE VISION. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I TELL YOU WHAT, THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE THAT LIKE TALKING AND TALKING AND TALKING AND THEY TALK AGAINST YOU. BUT DO YOU KNOW WHAT? THE MORE THEY TALK ABOUT YOU, THE MORE GOD LIFTS YOU. I HAVE SEEN THAT IN MY OWN LIFE. PEOPLE WHO LIKE TALKING. YOU REMEMBER HOW THEY TALKED AGAINST JOB. PEOPLE CAN TALK BROTHER BUT DON'T LET THE PEOPLE'S words to make YOUR THE VISION BEFORE YOU BLIND. THEY MAY SEE US HERE SITTING MAXIMUM MAYBE 200 PEOPLE 150 AND THEY THINK IT'S A SMALL MESSAGE WE ARE CARRYING. THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT WE ARE CARRYING. BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. CALB AND JOSHUA THAT TIME THE FIRE THEY WERE FEELING MAYBE THEY WERE SAYING IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME. EVERYBODY WILL SEE [screaming] EVERYBODY WILL KNOW IT WAS NOT OUR VISION. IT WAS THE VISION OF THE LORD. HE ANOINTED US UNDER THE MESSAGE OF A OF A VISION BEARER MOSES OUR PROPHET AND HE SENT US TO GO INTO the promised land. The denominations may think that we are some little little toms and some little susies on the on the back side. Brother, sister, we need to arise and catch the video and know what we are trying to do. We have a message, brothers. We're not just running aimlessly. We not even building an organization. Forget about that. We are not even trying TO BUILD A CHURCH. FORGET ABOUT THAT. WE HAVE A VISION. MY voice I feel right now is so small. I WISH THE HOLY GHOST CAN MAGNIFY IN YOUR HEART. WE HAVE A VISION AND WE ARE RUNNING BEHIND THAT VISION. DO YOU KNOW THE VISION WE HAVE? GOD HAS SENT US A MESSAGE. IT IS A THUS SAYETH THE [screaming] LORD. IT'S A MESSAGE TO RUN AWAY FROM NATIONS. AMEN. TO WHERE TO TO WHERE TO THE RAPTURE. I TELL YOU WHAT, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE DEVIL TRIES TO DO TO HINDER US, HE CANNOT STOP US. BROTHER SAMUEL, WE [screaming] ARE THE UNSTOPPABLE BRIDE. I SAID HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHERE WE ARE GOING. WE ARE GOING IN A RAPTURE. WE ARE NOT HERE FOR POLITICAL MANEUVERS TO FIGHT POLITICS. THAT'S ALL NONSENSE. WE HAVE A MESSAGE. WE ARE RUNNING AWAY. WE HAVE A VISION THAT WE ARE CARRYING IN THIS end time. I just pray and and wish everybody could could get that. Let me tell you, if we understand that EVF, &gt;&gt; we are going to begin sponsoring missionaries to go all over the world. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; At this point, you may think now I'm running crazy. I know what I'm talking about. We are going to begin financially supporting missionaries, sending preachers into the field, This church we're trying to build, IT WILL BE SOMETHING VERY SMALL. IF YOU CAN CATCH THE VISION, YOU WILL REALIZE THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE PASTOR. THIS IS NOT ABOUT THE CHURCH. IT'S ABOUT THE WORD. GOD HAS GIVEN TO US IN OUR GENERATION AND then you will RISE ABOVE your small little ideas and say we let us stand behind you. Yesterday on our family altar, I I just uh was speaking with my children and we read a scripture which Jesus was saying, you know, because the disciples were saying stay with us. He said, "No, for this reason I was born and I will go and preach the gospel to all over the world." And I told him that's why I go all over the world. That's why I travel and leave you. And I got to preach because I have a calling. This is the purpose reason why I was born. And then I asked each of them if you were to die right now and you reach in the presence of God and you are asked what did you do with the life God gave you? What will you answer? What did you do? What what will you say? Would you say I lived ate a lot of food, slept, worked for my boss? What would you say? What would you do? You see? Each of them began taking inventory. You know, the only thing that will matter is what you have done for the Lord. All the other things you did will not matter that I was a businessman running up and down and selling my products that you know I was educated. So I I was just going around and trying to to study and and work and and make some money. &gt;&gt; So what did you do with the money? You know I had to eat I had to buy clothes. You know, I also got children and so I had to take care of them. You can't even say that in his presence. &gt;&gt; You remember the man. I think it was Hezekiah that you know the king and you know he had to ask God please remember the good things I did for your work, for your kingdom. He began listing them. And then God was touched and he said, "Okay, 15 more years." Now if it was you, what would you tell the Lord that you have done even coming to church? You can't even come to church. I can't say that because that was helping myself. You will think what did I do? They play church instrument. But then the pastor forced me that day. It was not from my heart. So what did I do? I remember they begged me to go and no no. They begged me to sweep the ch. So I did not do it for my So what what did I do? Nothing. Ask yourselves, what have you done for the Lord? If you haven't, then you've not caught the vision. We need to catch the vision. We need to catch the vision, saints. Now, uh this is um a point that uh I want to talk about redemption by judgment. Brother Bam says, "Now Israel come up to Kadesh Banana." &gt;&gt; And here they come come back and Joshua and Calb, they were really all fired up. They must have had a prayer meeting over there. A real revival of some sort among themselves. AND WHEN THEY COME BACK, THEY SAID, "YES, WE CAN TAKE HER. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; BUT THE other 10 said no, we can't do that. Is that too much for us? Lack of faith. NOW LISTEN, CHRISTIANS, EVERYTHING IS BASED ON FAITH. AND FAITH CANNOT be right UNLESS IT'S GOT SOMETHING TO BE BASED ON. YOU CAN'T HAVE FAITH. SAY WELL I BELIEVE THAT I BELIEVE THIS IS MY BELIEF. MY BELIEF IS NO good if it is contrary to God's belief. You see WHY WE NEED VISION? BECAUSE YOU SEE WHEN GOD SENDS A MAN, ANOINTS HIM AND HE TELLS YOU GOD IS BELIEF. GOD HIS BELIEF WAS YOU WILL TAKE THE LAND FLOWING WITH MILK AND HONEY THAT WAS SPOKEN BY A GOD VINDICATED MAN. SO THEY HAD TO BASE THEIR FAITH ON THAT. AMEN. Do you know you can be sick in your body? You you walk right here at THE ALTAR &gt;&gt; AND I JUST TELL YOU YOU ARE HEALED and you say amen AND YOU GET HEALED. WHY? HOW? WHAT HAPPENED? WHAT CHEMISTRY? IT WAS FAITH BASED ON WHAT THE MAN OF GOD SAYING. HALLELUJAH. THAT'S why when YOU'RE HEARING THE WORD, DON'T JUST BE QUIET. SAY AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE YOUR FAITH IS BASED ON HEARING AND RECEIVING AND BELIEVING. But my belief is no good if it's contrary to God's belief. But if my belief with his ties with his then I GOT A FOUNDATION SONG. NO MATTER WHAT TAKES PLACE. WE ARE JUST GOING TO GO ANY because God said so. Amen. Now, that's the type of faith that Calb and Joshua have. Amen. That's the kind of faith I want to have because God said something. I believe it. That settles it. Amen. In a message presuming 1962, now Israel had sinned and had been grumbling and complaining and they come to a place called Kadesh and that was really the judgment seat. For out of there where went judgment and the days where Israel was judged KADESH BAN. WE ARE TOLD IT'S A LITTLE PLACE IN THE DESERT THE OTHER SIDE of Jordan that's got a few palm trees and in there there is one great spring of water and several small springs which MEANS A BEAUTIFUL TYPE WE COULD get of God's throne being the HOUSE OF JUDGMENT. AND THE LITTLE JUDGMENT PLACES COMING up because kadesh ban means judgment. This is a little judgment place where we are right now. And there is where Israel was judged because of their chiding, you know, like like uh uh resisting the word and and disobedience [clears throat] and interruption of the program of God. Are you hearing that? They are chiding. They are disobedience. They interruption of THE PROGRAM OF GOD. GOD HAS a program for every individual. God has a program for every local church. GOD HAS A PROGRAM FOR every generation. GOD HAS A PROGRAM FOR EVERY SEASON. You see never interrupt the program of God. A very TYPE OF TODAY THE CHURCH IN ITS DIFFERENCE differences interrupts the program OF GOD. GOD WANTS US TO GATHER AS ONE HEART, ONE SOUL, ONE MIND, [screaming] A RE repeat of Pentecost. Praise God. Now in the Smanian church age, he says only two were true believers, true believers. That is correct because the word tells us that the rest died because of unbelief. And because of unbelief they could not enter in. Then since that is so and only two entered then the rest were not true believers. Can you imagine that? What made the difference? It's a question. two stayed with the one when the hearts of the 10 spies failed at Kadesh. JOSHUA AND KAB DID NOT STAGGER FOR THEY BELIEVED THE WORD [screaming] and they SAID WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE TO TAKE THE LAND. THEY KNEW THAT they could be they could because God had said I have given you the land. After all those Israelites saw of the power and goodness and the deliverance of God, THEY DID NOT ENTER INTO REST. AND BROTHER BANHAM GOES AHEAD. ARE YOU LISTENING? Can you say amen? Brother Bham GOES AHEAD TO TELL US WHAT THIS REST WAS. He says they didn't they they didn't enter into THE REST WHICH IS A TYPE OF THE HOLY GHOST. SO YOU CAN SEE RIGHT NOW THAT VERY FEW WILL BELIEVE ALL THE WAY [screaming] TO RECEIVE IN THE SPIRIT OF GOD. HELLO. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; This is shocking. Imagine these people had come all the way. Oh my. I just quit around here and then I finish later. But listen, talking of their journey came a long way. Talk about their departure from Egypt. Talk about their crossing of the Red Sea. Talk about the wideness of shoe and the days they had WITHOUT WITHOUT WATER. HOW WHAT Moses did for them turn the bitter water into sweet the wilderness of sin the quills and the the meat that was provided there Mount Si and then all the THINGS THEY WENT THROUGH. NOW THEY HAVE ARRIVED AT KADESH WHICH IS THE LAST LAST STOP. THE LAST [screaming] PLACE THEY HAVE COME THROUGH ALL THE STAGES. THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE WORD. THEY HAVE BEEN JUSTIFIED. THEY HAVE BEEN SANCTIFIED. [screaming] AMEN. BUT THEN THEY REACH KADESH AND THEY SAID WE WILL NOT ENTER IN. &gt;&gt; [gasps] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE LAND WE HAVE HEARD, WE HAVE HEARD BY OUR OWN EARS. THE LAND IS EVIL. THE LAND SWALLOWS its own inhabitants. THE LAND HAS GIANTS. THE LAND IS TERRIBLE. WE WILL NOT ENTER. ARE YOU HEARING ME, CHURCH? WHAT IS THIS [screaming] LAND? WELL, IT WAS a land for them physically. THEY FAILED TO ENTER IT. BAM SAYS TODAY IS A TYPE OF THE [screaming] HOLY GHOST AND THE BRIDE THE CHURCH HAS REACHED KADESH YOU KNOW BELIEVED ALL THE MYSTERIES ACCEPTED ALL THE WORD AND DID YOU KNOW MANY SO-CALLED BELIEVERS MANY OF THEM THINK BY RECEIVING THE WORD THEY HAVE THE HOLY Ghost and MANY OF THEM REJECT THE HOLY GHOST. DID YOU KNOW THAT &gt;&gt; [screaming] &gt;&gt; THEY REFUSE TO ENTER THE REST. THEY REFUSE TO ENTER THE LAND. AND THEY ONLY STOP AT KADESH. BUT LET ME TELL YOU CHURCH, WE HAVE A PEOPLE IN THIS GENERATION THAT ARE NOT GOING TO STOP AT NOTHING. IT MAY NOT BE EASY FOR YOU TO CROSS OVER, AMEN, AND OVERCOME AND RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BROTHER, IF YOU BELIEVE, BELIEVE WHAT I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE GOD PROMISED ME, GOD SAID IT, I MUST RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. I MUST ENTER INTO THE LAND. I MUST BE BORN AGAIN. SOMETHING MUST HAPPEN. WHY? BECAUSE GOD SAID SO. [screaming] REPENT AND BE BAPTIZED EVERY ONE OF YOU AND RECEIVE REMISSION OF SINS AND THEN RECEIVE THE GIFT OF THE HOLY GHOST. IT IS A PROMISE. TELL YOUR NEIGHBOR, IT IS A PROMISE. IT IS A PROMISE. HE SAID HE SHALL THE PROMISE IS UNTO YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN. AMEN. IT'S A PROMISE GIVEN. IT MUST BE A PROMISE kept in our generation. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But there are some who refuse it. They would say we will not enter. We will not enter. We are okay here at Kadesh. We'd rather go back to Egypt. But here at Kadesh is a very good let us stay here. We have our prophet. We have the message. THAT'S ENOUGH. IT'S NOT [screaming] ENOUGH. YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL, ME AS AN INDIVIDUAL, YOU MUST BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY [screaming] GHOST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Whether you like me or you don't like me, what I'm saying is the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Pastor, you are now taking us deeper. I said, pastor, YOU'RE NOW CONFUSING US. I THOUGHT YOU HAVE ALREADY COME OUT OF EGYPT. YES, THAT [screaming] WAS THE FIRST STAGE. I THOUGHT I WAS EXCITED AND THINGS HAPPENED. &gt;&gt; YES, THAT WAS ANOTHER STAGE.
