with praise be to God come on how do you know that this person is the first preacher oh man you change your mind by the kind of fruits away amen Amina and in the message the proverb shows us he goes deep in that again when he was talking about the true friend and the false phrase I say these two trees that are intertwined that is praise be to God they are the same way it is when you look at passion fruits there are some trees which resemble passion fruit but not until you look at the fruits so Jesus told us Prophet will come like we are hearing today see that you'll be not trouble for

many false prophets shall rise and they shall deceive many and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall work called Jim [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] because iniquity shall abounding [Music] everywhere you see iniquity the whole world is flooded with iniquity and see your native double gem until it has now entered the churches where you can hardly separate the Christian church and

thought we are serving God dancing in the church like the world living like the world Amen [Applause] the love of many praise be to God in the message Criterion in the church age the problem is that I want to give you a warning right here it is concerning the last days but because of abounding iniquity the love of many will work [Music] and love for materials we are living in the time where people they love themselves every good thing they want it to be belonging to them praise be to God foreign [Applause] look at the churches today you find the pastors that are exploiting the church from the Widow to the richest [Music] the Bible tells us to feed that to help the winners [Music] but the judges of today they are exploiting rather than Windows because the lovers of them [Music] and the

the hearts are hard there is a spirit working around people today and it's like you're pouring the water on the back of the darker praise you to God it is the spirit of the age and The Same Spirit has
