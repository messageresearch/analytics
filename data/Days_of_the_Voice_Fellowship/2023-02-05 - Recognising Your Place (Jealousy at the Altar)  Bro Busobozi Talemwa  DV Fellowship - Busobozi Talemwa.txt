I want to greet every one of you in the precious name of our Lord Jesus. I don't know the deacons. Can you help me make sure there is no seat in front? If you have a seat in front of you, please take it. Anyone who has a seat in front of him, you are in the wrong place. All right. God bless you. Please, please don't don't fear to be near the fire. Have we come to hear from the Lord this morning? So we are not afraid to be close. Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them God bless you. Are you ready to hear from the Lord? While we are still standing, I'll just ask you to go to the book of Mark, chapter 9. Most of our students have gone back to school. So, schools have resumed. But I was glad that at least we had a youth convention before the schools started. It was a a good timing. So we are going to take Mark chapter 9 verse 38. We are going to read only two um three verses and then we shall sit and then read the rest later. Okay. So I'll read. And John answered and answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he followth not us. And we forbid him because he followeth not us. And Jesus said, "Forbid him not, for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that can lightly speak evil of me. For he that is not against us is on our part. Amen. Let us uh first pray again. Lord Jesus, We just humbly ask you to come at this time Lord and honor this meeting Lord by your presence. Lord we are unworthy in ourselves. We just depending on you to come and speak to us. You know what your people need, Lord. You know what you've laid on my heart. Take it Lord and divide it to each heart here as according to the need Lord. Even whoever that might see or be streaming or see this later Lord that you will speak to them. We just need your presence Lord. Father we ask this in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. You may be seated. So to our friends uh brethren who are joining us for the first time we want to say you are welcome feel free to feel feel at home. Is that brother Ivan to see you. God bless you. Amen. You're welcome back. You're welcome back to your home. Amen. brother here I think. Are you with your family? Oh yes. God bless you. We happy to fellowship with you today. Amen. Amen. And our sister you said you are not a visa. I think your face is also not very new but so this morning I'm speaking on uh uh something that the Lord has laid on my heart. And I pray that God will be able to take it, divide it, and put it into each of our hearts. So I'm going to speak on recognizing your place. But the my inspiration is jealousy at the altar. So I'm going to request little movement as much as possible. You try to be in that seat at least until the end of the preaching. Amen. So that the Lord will speak to you. How many are expecting from the Lord? Amen. So jealousy at the altar. Now here we know that in this church in this church is that hard to interpret? No. I've said many times that we are not a church. I've said many times that we are a fellowship of a main church. Jesus does not have two, three, four, five churches. And so really what I'm going to preach today is more of instructional and maybe a little bit more putting a few things in order. It's not one of those uh sermons I've been preaching in the past. So I want you to listen carefully. So that this church that Jesus has is one church. How many believe that Jesus does not have two, three, four, five churches? Jesus has only one church and that is the church we we sing about called the church triumphant and that church is what Jesus said he has built on the rock that is the revelation of himself that church is built upon the revelation of who Jesus is and that is one church. It is a worldwide church. There is members of that church in every part of the world. Wherever you go, you will find members of that church. We don't join that church by water baptism. We don't join that church by shaking of the hand of the pastor. We don't join that church by registering on a church book. We don't join that church by paying our tithe to that church. Actually, we are members of that church not by joining it. We are members of that church by being born into it. JUST LIKE YOU WERE born into your family by a birth. In the same way, we are born into that family by a birth, BY A SPIRITUAL BIRTH OF THE HOLY SPIRIT. The moment you receive the Holy Spirit in your soul, you are a member of that church. Now, WHEN THE WHEN JESUS CHRIST COMES, He is going to come and rapture members of that church. ONLY MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH. AMEN. AMEN. Now the members of that church remember ARE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE WORLD. They in every place on earth. And the MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH CAN RECEIVE THE FULL WORD OF GOD. THE MEMBERS OF OUR CHURCH WILL BE HOLY GHOST filled and holy ghost led. THEY WILL HAVE OVERCOME SIN. THEY WILL HAVE THE CHARACTER OF JESUS CHRIST. But so YOU SEE THAT CHURCH IS A UNIVERSAL CHURCH. It's a universal church of Jesus Christ. And now we know that WE HAVE THE CATHOLIC CHURCH. The Catholic church calls itself that church because the word Catholic means universal. AND SO THE ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH HAS CLAIMED to be that church. And they say they are the mother church. And they said everyone who is going to heaven should be a PART OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SYSTEM. But according to the word, we have found THAT THE CATHOLIC CHURCH SYSTEM DOES NOT meet the qualification of being that church because they are a CHURCH DENOMINATION. THEY ARE a religious system. THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT A RELIGIOUS SYSTEM. THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS NOT LOCATED IN ONE PLACE. It is not even a local church. The church of Jesus CHRIST IS A UNIVERSAL CHURCH all over the world. AND MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH ARE BORN into it by being filled with the Holy Ghost, believing the word of the hour by accepting everything THE WORD OF GOD says by receiving the Holy Ghost. Now we realize that that church is a many membered body. your attention this morning. That church IS A MANY MEMBERED BODY. You will find some members of it in one location. Like I told you, we went to Kamoja. There was even no road to go there. And when we reached there, we found actually by the on the last day we in the last service there were 700 people. Did you know that in the bush there 700 people 700 people they were members of that body. One day I went to Ethiopia in a very rural area where there was even no road. We parked somewhere and we had to to to take the rest of the journey by on horseback. It was my first time to use a horse. So I had to learn how to guide it. And and you know it was a very interesting journey. And you see when we reached there there was that a few members of that church. They were baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and they received the Holy Spirit. and we've been in many places and you know one time a brother went to Germany and he asked me if there is any church where he is I told him yes there's a local assembly there and so it was just next door to where he was that he didn't even know so he just walked there and he found some believers there and they were telling him God bless That church has the same spirit all over the world. Wherever you go, you'll find members of that church. They have the same spirit. Amen. Whether they are white or red or yellow or black. They have the same same spirit. You will find the sisters. They are wearing modestly. They are dressing in dresses and in skirts. You will not find one member of that body IN A TROUSER. YOU cannot because the members of that church are all guided by the same word you will find even if you go to America, MEMBERS OF THAT CHURCH BODY, YOU WILL FIND THEM WHEN they hear the word, they will rejoice. SHOUT GLORY, HALLELUJAH, GLORY. The same way we do here, you will find them dancing the same way we do here. Even when THAT COUNTRY IS SO cold and the MANNERISM OF THAT COUNTRY IS SO different when they when they when they are members of the church of Christ in that country, you will find them behaving the same same way that everybody else is behaving as members of that church body. Are you following me? THEY WILL BEHAVE the same way. THEY WILL BELIEVE THE SAME THING. THEY WILL PREACH THE SAME GOSPEL. THEY WILL FOLLOW THE SAME characteristics as the very first church in the book of acts. Now in some place you may find there are thousands. In some place you may find two. In some place you may find 80 50. In some place you may find 2,000. I remember one time I spoke to a local church of 3,000. For my first time, I was overwhelmed. And they all believed what I believe. They all preached the same Bible the way I preached it. They all believed in the baptism in Jesus name. They all believed God has sent a prophet in our generation baptized with the Holy Ghost. Let me tell you, they are members of that church. And now we have what we call local assemblies. Local assemblies. Local assemblies. Wherever they gather. Some could be under a tree like in Kamoja. It could be in a building like this. Others it will be in a better building. Others will be in a bigger building. But really it is the same church. Those are just members. They are fellowships of the same church. Are you following me this morning? Now when Jesus Christ is coming to rapture the bride, he doesn't know days of the voice fellowship. Days of the voice. He doesn't know evening light bright tabernacle. Evening light bride. He doesn't know what what are the names. Only believe. Only believe. He doesn't know any of those names you've mentioned. He doesn't know nothing. The only thing he knows, my bride and that is the one he is coming to. When he comes to rapture his bride, he is NOT GOING TO FIRST ASK YOU WHO WAS YOUR PASTOR. But what is he going to do? Did you believe my word? Did you receive the token? DO YOU HAVE THE TOKEN? THE MOMENT HE FINDS THE TOKEN THERE, YOU are members. HE WILL RAPTURE YOU NOW. PRAISE the name of the Lord. Amen. Now, we appreciate local fellowships because in local fellowships like this one here, DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP, this is where we are FED FROM THE WORD OF GOD MATURES US INTO INTO THE FULL STATURE OF CHRIST. AND EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP HAS A PART TO PLAY. BUT NOW MANY TIMES WE FIND THAT EVEN WITHIN LOCAL FELLOWSHIP SOME PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT EACH OF THEM HAS A PART TO PLAY. SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THEY ARE THE ONLY ONES WHO ARE TO PLAY THE ONLY ROLE. You see even within the local church you have the song leader, you have the the musicians, you have the interpreters, you have the ushers, you have the cleaners, you have the deacons. What else do we have? We have the singers. You see, you clap your hands. You rejoice at the word. You know me, if you're just looking at me, I can't preach to you. You have to rejoice at the word. When you rejoice at the word, then God will bring more. When you rejoice, God brings more. So you also have a part to play. Amen. This is more than a stadium. You don't just in a stadium they rejoice and shout at the holler. What about in the house of God? We do the same SAME WAY EVEN MUCH MORE. We rejoice at the word. WE SAY GLORY HALLELUJAH. GLORY HALLELUJAH. And then God brings more to you. And then God brings more for you. So each of US HAS A PART TO PLAY even in the local body. Each of you has your place. Each of us has our place. Tell your neighbor, you have your place. You have your place. Let me tell you, each of you has to find YOUR PLACE IN THE BODY. IF YOU'VE NOT FOUND YOUR PLACE IN THE BODY OF CHRIST, YOU are an inactive member. YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT IS [screaming] YOUR PLACE. GOD HAS BROUGHT YOU INTO THIS BODY. WHAT IS YOUR PLACE? ARE YOU THE EYE? Are you the ear? Are you the feet? ARE YOU THE HANDS? WHAT ARE YOU? YOU MUST BE A PART OF THE BODY WHEN YOU ARE ACTIVE. Praise the name of the Lord. NOW, AS IT IS IN THE LOCAL CHURCH BODY, so is IT IN THE UNIVERSAL CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST, EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP, WHEREVER THEY ARE, THEY HAVE THEIR [screaming] PLACE. WE HEAR DAYS OF THE VOICE. WE HAVE OUR PLACE. AMEN. ONLY BELIEVER HAS THEIR PLACE. ONLY BELIEVE. EVENING LIGHT HAS THEIR PLACE. EVERY CHURCH HAS THEIR PLACE. AND LISTEN, NO CHURCH FELLOWSHIP CAN TAKE THE OTHER'S PLACE. NO MINISTER CAN TAKE ANY OTHER'S PLACE. NOBODY IN THE CHURCH CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. EACH INDIVIDUAL IS DIFFERENT. Each ministry IS DIFFERENT. WE DO NOT NEED TO COPY OR TO IMPERSONATE ONE ANOTHER. SAYS, "OH, I SAW PASTOR PREACHING WHEN DANCING AROUND. Let me do IT THE WAY YOU ARE DOING IT. IF YOU DO IT, YOU'LL ONLY BE ME. BUT YOU CANNOT BE ME. IF I TRY TO PREACH LIKE BROTHER MARTIN, I CANNOT. If I try TO PREACH LIKE ANOTHER PREACHER, I CANNOT BE MYSELF. AND IF ANOTHER PREACHER TRIES TO IMPERSONATE ME, THEY CANNOT MAKE it anymore. But why DO WE HAVE THOSE THINGS EVERYWHERE? BECAUSE WE HAVE NOT RECOGNIZE OUR PLACE. the day BEFORE WE FAILED. WE HAD TO BE WHAT GOD CALLED US TO BE AND WE MOVE ON. IF ALL OF US, EACH OF YOU, if we realize this, we could actually advance the kingdom of God more. There would be no room for jealousy. THERE would be no room for envy. NO ONE WOULD BE INTIMIDATED. OH, NO ONE WOULD FEEL INFERIOR. Are you following me? I'm dealing with some stuff this morning which I believe will help us to shape this fellowship into knowing our place. When when Jesus preaches to the disciples He calls the disciples. He He sends them out and they GO PREACHING, DOING MIRACLES, SIGNS AND WONDERS. Jesus himself was the one who groomed these men. JESUS HIMSELF CALLED THESE MEN. HE SANCTIONED THEM. And then they went out to preach. They went casting out devils in the name of Jesus. And one time they even came back to Jesus AND THEY SAID ALL DEMONS TREMBLE. WHEN THEY SEE US THEY TREMBLE AND SHOUT. And Jesus said that shouldn't make you excited. What should excite you is because your names are on the book of life. You should know your place. If you know your place, that should be enough to excite you. Do you know your place in the book? That should excite you. Amen. BUT THE DISCIPLES CAME. ONE time they came back. I believe one time as they were going out to preach, THEY SAW SOME OTHER PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE THAT WERE NOT PART OR MEMBERS OF THEIR LOCAL FELLOWSHIP. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT A PART OF WHERE THEY COME FROM. THE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT PASTORED BY THEIR PASTOR. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE OF ANOTHER FELLOWSHIP SOMEWHERE ELSE AND WHEN THEY SAW THEM THEY CAME RUNNING. THEY CAME BACK TO THEIR PASTOR AND THEY SAID, "PASTOR JESUS, CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT WE FOUND? WE FOUND ONE PERSON OUT THERE. HE WAS CASTING OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME AND WE TOLD HIM YOU SHOULD STOP. AND THE REASON WE GAVE [screaming] HIM WAS NOT BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH. HOW CAN HE CH OUT DEMONS IN YOUR NAME WHEN HE'S NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH? HE HAS TO BE A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH. MIRACLES ARE ONLY COPYRIGHTED TO OUR CHURCH. THE POWER OF GOD IS ONLY IN OUR FELLOWSHIP. GOD IS ONLY MOVING HERE. AND WE TOLD THOSE PEOPLE, YOU ARE EITHER IN OUR CHURCH OR YOU ARE LOST. AND WE TOLD THEM, "SHUT UP. YOU HAVE NOTHING TO SAY AS LONG AS YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH." BUT JESUS LOOKED AT THE DISCIPLES AND HE TOLD THEM, "WHAT HAVE YOU DONE, THEY THAT ARE NOT AGAINST US? THEY ARE FOR US." HALLELUJAH. LET ME TELL YOU, LET ME TELL YOU, ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING IN THE RAPTURE, THEY ARE NOT ONLY HERE, THEY ARE NOT ONLY IN ONE LOCAL FELLOWSHIP, THEY ARE ALL [screaming] OVER. THEY EVERYWHERE AND I AM NOT THEIR PASTOR. I AM ONLY A PASTOR OF A FEW. IF EVERY LOCAL FELLOWSHIP WAS ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WOULD HAVE LESS JEALOUSY. WE WOULD HAVE LESS ENVY. WE WOULD NOT feel inferior. God look at the other church. They have more people. Oh God, me. Oh God, what am I going to do? Look at look at when I look at my church. God, I only have 50 people. Oh God. Oh God, why don't you make my church like the other? Oh God, look at the other church. They have instruments. Goodness, Lord. when they begin playing. Oh God, I don't even want to look at them because I feel bad. Oh, I wish mine was also like that. Oh god, THAT PREACHER. I even wish he was my pastor. When he begins preach, look at my pastor. This is what you have everywhere. Even in the message circles you have people envious you have people feeling you you have feeling inferior and others feel INTIMIDATED ministry is going to overwhelm my ministry and you fight you find pastors fighting against pastors you find churches fighting against churches you find even people saying my pastor is better than yours ministry is THE BEST IN THE NO, [screaming] YOUR MINISTRY IS NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD. YOU HAVE ONLY HAD ONE MINISTRY IN OUR GENERATION and the BEST IN THE WORLD. THAT'S THE MINISTRY OF JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. AND HE HAS SENT HIS PROPHET WITH A MESSAGE OF THE END TIME, THE SECOND BEST MINISTRY IN THE WORLD. WE ALL ARE [screaming] FELLOWSHIP MEMBERS. REALLY, WE ARE ALL MEMBERS OF THE SAME ONE UNIVERSAL CHURCH. Praise the name of the Lord. And so Jesus told the disciples. You couldn't HAVE STOPPED THEM. GOD FORBID THEM. THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD A COPYRIGHT ON JESUS. No one has a copyright on Jesus to THE EXTENT SOME CHURCHES WILL EVEN IN THE message even in the message they WILL FEEL AS IF THAT THEY HAVE [screaming] THEY HAVE THE THE FINAL SAY THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY ON SOMEBODY. IF YOU WENT TO ANOTHER CHURCH, THEY WOULD TELL YOU YOU ARE [screaming] LOST. LET ME TELL YOU, YOU THAT FELLOWSHIP IN THIS CHURCH, I HAVE NO [screaming] OR COPYRIGHT OVER YOU. I DON'T OWN YOU. JESUS OWNS YOU. NOT DAYS OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP. DAYS OF THE VOICE. HALLELUJAH. WHAT DO WE BELIEVE? NO BOOK, NO BOOK, BUT THE BIBLE. MEMBERSHIP BUT FELLOWSHIP. WE DON'T COME HERE TO BE MEMBERS. WE HAVE WE COME HERE TO HAVE FELLOWSHIP. FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WORD OF GOD. FELLOWSHIP WITH THE HOLY GHOST, FELLOWSHIP WITH THE WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES US MEMBERS OF THE FULL UNTIL EVEN SOME WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR FELLOWSHIP WHERE YOU WERE ATTENDING. MAYBE YOU WERE COMING FROM FAR AND YOU WENT TO ANOTHER PLACE. THEN YOUR PASTOR WILL TELL YOU YOU MUST TRAVEL BACK HERE. If you don't YOU HAVE LEFT YOUR BLESSING HERE. THAT IS A LIE FROM THE DEVIL. YOUR BLESSING IS IN THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR. NOT IN A LOCAL CHURCH BODY. YES, we believe IN A LOCAL CHURCH. WE BELIEVE IN HAVING A PASTOR. WE BELIEVE IN ATTENDING A CHURCH WHERE YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE. A CHURCH WHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHE. A CHURCH WHERE YOU MUST BE AMEN. YOU MUST ATTEND EVERY SERVICE. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO THAT CHURCH. That's what THE PROPHET SAYS. YOU HAVE A DUTY TO THAT CHURCH TO GO AND BE THERE WITH YOUR PRESENCE AND SUPPORT WITH YOUR MONEY. IT IS YOUR LOCAL CHURCH. YOU ARE A PLAY. YOU ARE A PART IN THAT BODY. AND WE believe in that in the message. LISTEN, THAT IN ITSELF DOES NOT REMOVE THE FACT THAT THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST IS UNIVERSAL. If you were LIVING IN A LOCAL PLACE AND YOU MOVE TO ANOTHER LOCAL PLACE AND FOR SOME REASON OR ANOTHER YOU CAN'T GO BACK THERE, IT IS YOUR RIGHT TO CHANGE TO ANOTHER LOCAL CHURCH. AS A MATTER OF FACT, THE PROPHET SAYS, YOU ALL HAVE TO MAKE A CHOICE WHICH LOCAL CHURCH TO ATTEND. NO PASTOR CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOU. JUST LIKE YOU MAKE YOUR OWN CHOICE ON WHO TO MARRY, NO PASTOR CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR YOU. IN THE SAME SAME WAY, YOU MAKE A CHOICE OF WHICH CHURCH, LOCAL CHURCH BODY TO ATTEND. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And so we notice here that the DISCIPLES CAME RUNNING. I SAID JESUS THESE MEN WHERE DID THEY GET A RIGHT TO CAST OUT DEMONS where they get a right where they are not a member of our church for Jesus looked at the poor disciples what are you talking ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT CHURCH MEMBERSHIP it's not about AFFILIATION about the HOLY GHOST IT'S ABOUT THE POWER OF MY NAME. ANYBODY THAT BELIEVES IN ME AND USES MY NAME, NO MATTER WHICH LOCAL CHURCH FELLOWSHIP, THEN MY NAME WILL WORK MIRACLES. The only one who has no right is the one who really is not a true believer. And even then it is not your part to tell them you're not a true believer. God himself does that part. And I'll show you here some people who actually thought they were part of the church and God proved them otherwise. You go to Acts 19:3. I'm dealing with some spirits here and I really want you to cuz I'm laying a foundation for our fellowship here and I want you to really listen carefully. Acts chapter 19 verse 13. Then certain of the vagabon Jews exist took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord JESUS SAYING WE ADARE YOU BY JESUS WHOM PAUL PREACHETH. And there were seven sons ofKeva, a Jew and a chief of the priests which did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus, I know and Paul I KNOW, BUT WHO ARE YE?" AND THE MAN IN WHOM the evil spirit was leaped on them and overcame them and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at at Ephesus. And fear fell on them all. And the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified. Now listen to me. In this portion which we have read very interesting these Jews sons of seven sons of they came to some people and they also wanted to use the name of Jesus but they themselves were not genuine believers. Are you hearing me? And they began. WE HAVE STARTED OUR CHURCH HERE. We are more than three because a church is more than two. Two and above is a church. According to the Bible, he says where two or three are gathered, I will be in their midst. church, meaning a local body, a local fellow. So these were seven already and I BELIEVE THEY HAD SOME MEMBERS WHOM THEY WERE CASTING out demons from. Praise the name of the Lord. And as they begin praying, WE HAVE OUR CHURCH HERE. We have our FELLOWSHIP HERE. GOD HAS MOVED ON us to start a fellowship. Let me tell you, let me let me tell you. Let me tell you. If God ever let someone cut you and start another fellowship, you have my support 100%. Amen. Brother Solomon, if God led you to start a fellowship in one away from here, you have my support 100%. Do you believe God still leads? God leads. Why did I say that? If it is God, he proves it. If it is not God, he proves it. AND THESE ONES WENT OUT SAID WE HAVE A BURDEN TO START a ministry. I start a ministry. So they started and ONE OF THEM STARTED PREACHING. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND HE CAME TO SOMEWHERE DEMONP POSSESSED SAID I CAST YOU OUT IN THE NAME OF [screaming] JESUS WHOM PAUL IS PREACHING ABOUT. And these demons looked at this. They said what the NAME OF JESUS. WE KNOW PAUL WE KNOW YOU. WE DON'T KNOW. WHO ARE YOU? THIS ONE SAID, "Come here." And the demons and those people unrest them and unrest them. And so they WERE ALL SCRATCHED ALL OVER, scratched everywhere. And even they had they had only a few pieces of cloth on them. and they went out ashamed. SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT HAPPENED THERE? DID THEY USE THE NAME OF JESUS? YES. SO WHAT WENT WRONG? THEY WERE NOT INDEED CALLED. [screaming] THEY WERE NOT PART OF THE BODY TO BEGIN WITH. THEIR MOTIVES WAS WRONG. THEY WERE NOT FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST THEMSELVES. THEY DID HAVE NO BURDEN FROM THE Lord and the demons didn't fear them and their work NEVER PROSPERED. IF GOD SENDS YOU, YOUR WORK WILL PROSPER ALWAYS. IF GOD, AMEN, ANOINTS YOU TO DO SOMETHING. What you're doing WILL SEE THE BLESSING OF THE LORD. It could be in the local body, but every time you're singing a special song, you are causing confusion. Rather sit down. It's not your rightful place. EVERY TIME you go TO PLAY THE PIANO, CONFUSION, just leave the thing. IF WHAT? IF GOD IS SENDING YOU TO DO SOMETHING, IT WILL SEE HIS BLESSING. Praise the name of the Lord. AND SO WHEN GOD CALLED US HERE as an example to start days OF THE VOICE FELLOWSHIP, I CAN NOW SAY, IT WAS GOD. WHY SOULS ARE SAVED? THE DEMON POSSESSED A DELIVER. PEOPLE HAVE BEEN FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THE POWER OF GOD HAS BEEN MOVING. GOD HAS BEEN MOVING IN OUR LIVES. HAS HE BEEN MOVING? THAT IS A PROOF TO THE DEVIL THAT GOD IS WITH US. AND NOW WE ARE NOT THE ONLY ONES, GOD WILL keep sending more. If 10 people rose up around me to start up another fellowship, I wouldn't worry a bit. Why? If God sent them, it will prosper their way. If it's not God, it will show itself. Secondly, I can never be them. They can never be me. I am not intimidated by them. You should never be intimidated by somebody else. Oh, that sister is singing a better special. Oh God. Now when I sing, nobody would even be blessed. That's the devil lying to you. You are you and nobody is like you. You are the only one in the world like you. Always be confident. Always know your place. There is a blessing in recognizing your place. So in Luke 9:49, the Bible says, "And John answered AND SAID, MASTER, WE SAW ONE CASTING OUT DEVILS IN THY NAME, and we forbid him because he followth not with us." And Jesus said unto him, "Forbid him not, for he that is not against us is for us. for he that is not against us is for us. Can we say amen? The disciples became jealous when they saw someone doing what they were doing. And many pastors even in the message are like these disciples. They became jealousy when they saw someone doing what they were doing. SO OUR MASTER we stopped them because what they were doing they were not following us. Who told you I have to follow you in order to do what you're doing? I don't have to follow anybody. I have to follow Jesus Christ. But these disciples thought if YOU ARE NOT A MEMBER OF OUR CHURCH OR IF YOU ARE NOT FOLLOWING US, you are against us. And that's how denominations have been formed. One day I went to Nairobi and I was so flabbergasted. I met this sister and I was in a certain local fellowship and they were having the Lord's supper and this sister she was from another local fellowship just like me. We [clears throat] were in that local fellowship and the sister, she didn't go to take the Lord's supper and she was a message believer. So I said, "Why?" She said, "Because this is not my church." I said, "What? You mean if it's not your local fellowship, you can't have the Lord supper here? I'm sorry. Someone has to correct me. I thought that was wrong. We take the Lord's supper as members of the church of Jesus Christ, not as members of a local fellowship. I think it HAS COME TO A PLACE WHERE WE HAVE MADE OURSELVES DENOMINATIONS. ORGANIZED RELIGION IN THE message and YET IN THE MESSAGE LISTEN IN THE MESSAGE WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FREE FLYING BIRDS. [screaming] WE HAVE RECEIVED THE ANOINTING OF A FLYING [screaming] EAGLE. WHERE WE ARE NOT BOUND BY RELIGIOUS BOUNDARIES. HALLELUJAH. WHERE TWO THINGS ARE LEADING US. THE WORD OF [screaming] GOD. EVERYBODY SAY THE WORD OF GOD. THE WORD OF GOD to the Holy Spirit. COME ON, SAY THE HOLY GHOST. IN THE MESSAGE. WE ARE NOT A DENOMINATION WHICH LEAD US TO THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE WORD not the laws of our churches WHERE WE FELLOWSHIP. EVEN IF me your PASTOR I TELL YOU LET US DO THIS OR DO YOU DO THAT AND IT CONTRADICTS THE WORD YOU CAN REJECT WHAT I TELL YOU OBEY WHAT THE WORD SAYS FOLLOW ME AS I FOLLOW CHRIST SO WE FOLLOW YOU AS LONG AS YOU'RE FOLLOWING JESUS CHRIST IF YOU FOLLOW SOMETHING ELSE I I'M SORRY I CAN'T FOLLOW YOU NO MORE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE NOT IN THE DENOMINATION. THAT'S WHY WE LEFT THE DENOMINATION. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. TO BE FREE PEOPLE. TO BE FREE PEOPLE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOLY GHOST TO BE FREE PEOPLE. THEY WILL FOLLOW EVERY WORD OF GOD. So these disciples they became jealous when someone was doing what they were doing. They thought that they had a copyright on the name Jesus. They thought that they were the only one that were called and anointed and favored. I'm telling you if you're not going to days of the voice fellowship days of the voice you missing the rapture. Who told you? I never wanted to come to that place where I tell people that if you're not coming to my church, you're not going to the right. It is God who has a copyright for them. The Bible says the secret is he knows those that are his. You know what made denominations? Do you know what made them? The Catholics [clears throat] said, "We are the only church. As long as you are not a member, you are lost." The Anglicans also say, "WE ARE THE ONLY CHURCH. IF YOU'RE NOT A MEMBER, YOU ARE LOST." The Pentecostal groups, the holiness, we are the only church. We are the only church assemblies of God. We are the only church apostolic. We are the only church and now in the message it has gotten to that extent. WE ARE THE ONLY CHURCH. IF YOU'RE NOT COMING OF THE FAVOR FELLOWSHIP, YOU ARE LOST TO THE EXTENT THAT SOMEONE WILL TRAVEL 100 kilometers to GO TO A CHURCH WHEN THERE ARE 50 CHURCHES IN THAT DISTANCE. AND HE'S NOT TRAVELING THAT DISTANCE BECAUSE THE HOLY GHOST LED HIM. BUT HE'S TRAVELING THAT DISTANCE BECAUSE HE KNOWS IF YOU'RE NOT FOLLOWING US, YOU ARE LOST. That's a denominational spirit. That's a religious spirit. But we are no longer OF RELIGION OR RELIGIOUS LEAD SPIRIT. GOD HAS CALLED US OUT OF DENOMINATIONAL BARRIERS. HE SAID, "COME UP. COME UP, [screaming] MY EGOS. COME AND GO BEYOND THAT. COME IN a place where I'm going to prepare you for the rapture." And I'm not saying that we do also like the religious people do that we go to the nearest church. No. We are not religions. We don't go to the nearest church. We have some people here who have traveled 50 kilometers to me. You go to a church that is preaching the full word of God and believes the moving of the Holy Ghost. Number three, a church that your spirit is happy with where you are growing in the spirit. A church where you feel that you you you have the liberty of the Holy Ghost for you to grow for you to expand in the realm of the Holy Spirit. A church where where you are growing uh by being fed on the true word of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Not because I told you, oh now if you leave here you are lost. GOD HELP US. GOD HELP US THAT WE WILL recognize our praise. They forgot that they had to mind their calling. You see, actually to them calling on the name of Jesus was right and as long as it was done by them. Listen to what Bam says here in a messenger greater than Solomon is here. And actually he says, brother Bham says, notice now how petty these people can be. These disciples just like other men. Two or three days later, they found a man casting out devils and he was getting the job done. Amen. Amen. He was doing a real job. And the disciples found him. And just like the men of our day, of our day, they said, they said, "You come and join our denomination. You are casting a demon and you're doing the job. How can it be? Let me tell you, let me listen. I found called church to be interpreted apostolic church of Ethiopia. And this church if you don't know the foundations of the message properly, you will actually think you have arrived in that church. They believe what? What do you What do you believe here? Tell me what do you believe? Decency. They believe in decency. Be specific. Be specific. Women not cutting off their hair. They believe that. What else? Baptism in Jesus name. They believe that one God. They believe that the Holy Spirit. They believe that they speak in tong. Women don't preach. They believe that. Sometimes they may let them preach but it is very rare. So if you are gone there the first time you may not know that they interpret tongues rapture they believe they are the only ones going in the rapture. Sisters, don't put on makeup. Oh, yeah. Now, some of you are saying yes. No, they don't. They don't even know that God sent a prophet. Now, we are beginning the difference. Did you hear what I said? Now, if you don't know what you believe, among these [clears throat] people actually I met this one of their elders. He told me brother the only church of Jesus Christ is the apostolic church. They are calling apostolic because they believe everything the apostles taugh and they say if you're not a part of the religious denomination you are lost. They have members, I mean they have their branches all over the world, even here in Uganda. And those people have genuine love. Genuine love, but they are the greatest denomination I've ever seen. So they do not know that denomination is even going to be the one to bring the mark of that beast. There have to come a time where they have to give the right hand of fellowship according to the prophecy. They don't know that God sent a prophet. They don't know about the revelation of the seven seals. They don't know about the serpent seed. I'm telling you, there are many things they don't know. And yet, these are the things that are going to perfect the bride for the rapture. So now, HOW are you going to meet such people? If you thought YOU WERE THE ONLY one that knows what you know, as a matter of fact, for them, they don't even wear rings. because they say it is worldly. But in the message we even use actually it is getting more worldly indeed in the message. But those people they they are cleaned up from those things. But we know it also gets to a place where they go legalism. I'm telling you this so you can know. You are not the only ones who believe the basics that you believe. There are many others WHO BELIEVE IT AND PART of your system. I would not be shocked if some believers who would go in the rapture are even a part of those You see, you kept quiet because you also believing like the disciples. THEY ARE NOT A [screaming] PART OF US. WE STOPPED THEM. You don't you don't have the key for the rapture. You don't have the key to open and close the DOOR FOR THE RAPTURE. THAT IF SOMEONE DOES NOT come to your church, he's going to hell. NO, IT IS GOD WHO HAS KEPT THAT FOR HIMSELF. THE BIBLE SAYS HE KNOWS THEM THAT ARE HIS. If I was this disciples, I may NOT UNDERSTAND. SINCERELY, I want you, brother, to try and understand them. these men. They know Jesus is the Messiah. They know he's the one who called them and trained them. How many did he call? 12. So where did these other where did they get the money? HOW HOW COME? THAT'S WHY THEY DIDN'T even ask BEFORE THEY STOPPED THIS. THEY JUST SHUT UP. PLEASE don't defame the name of our Lord. Shut up. But Jesus told them, I understand you. You were not there when I was calling those. They are not even a part of our members of our church. if they are not against us. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WE SHOULD HAVE THAT OPEN MIND TO KNOW THAT GOD IS USING ALL THOSE MESSAGE CHURCHES THAT ARE NOT US. And God has POTENTIAL OF CALLING HIS BRIDE WHEREVER SHE IS. HALLELUJAH. SHE MIGHT BE IN A CATHOLIC CHURCH. YES, SIR. YES. SHE MIGHT BE IN AN ANGLICAN CHURCH SOMEWHERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE WILL BELIEVE THAT. SOMEBODY WILL CALL HER OUT OF THERE. SHE'LL BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. YOU DON'T HAVE A [screaming] COPYRIGHT ON THE RAPTURE. MUST MIND YOUR CALLING OR YOU [screaming] ARE BLESSED. MANY PEOPLE HAVE COME TO ME AND asked if you preach against women preachers. Are you saying all women preachers are going to hell? I said that is not mine to say but here's what the Bible says. My mandate is to preach what THE BIBLE SAYS. MY MAND HALLELUJAH IS TO TELL YOU THE RAPTURE IS COMING. MY MANDATE, AMEN, IS TO PREACH TO YOU THE HOLY GHOST. MY MANDATE IS TO TELL YOU THAT JESUS IS ALIVE. ANYBODY ELSE DOING ANYTHING THEY WANT TO DO, IT IS NONE OF MY BUSINESS AND I AM NOT GOING TO FIGHT THEM. THAT'S why I don't believe in THE GOSPEL PREACHING AGAINST OTHERS. NO, THAT IS NOT THE GOSPEL. LET ME ASK you a question, church. What is the gospel? But what is the gospel? The word gospel means what? God bless you. The gospel is good news. So if I come here and I begin fighting against fighting against I'm sorry that is not the gospel and some preachers even mentioned these names and nailed those. What about if you found in the rapture? Now you are feeling like the disciples. How come that they come here? I'm telling you the apostolic church believe they're the only ones going in the rapture. I don't know about I know about the mandate that I have that I'm preaching the message preparing the bride and so brother Bham here then continues to say and the disciples found him just like the men of our day they said you come and join our actually just remember this this man is a is a fat man with fat big eyes. And so he told me when he SAID WHEN THE MOMENT THEY MEET YOU, he ask you, "Do you believe in one God?" I said, "Yes." Yeah. Do you believe in what about Christian? Yes. He opened his mouth and then he thought of something else to ask. They have some differences there. The difference they have, they have two groups. Apostolic Church and the United Pentecostal Church. United Pentecostal Church. The difference they have, one says the body of Jesus was divine and others say the body was a human. But they both believe he was God. So now he asked me. So when we went into that, I told him The seed of Jesus was not from Joseph. It was from God. Therefore, I believe he was 100% man. 100% God. He opened his mouth and his eyes. Then why don't he join us? According to him, I believed everything they believe. I'm supposed to be a part of them. I I told him, "My brother, all those things I believe, but there is more." He said, "How come THERE IS MORE? THERE CAN'T BE MORE." I SAID, "BROTHER, THERE IS MORE." I TELL YOU IN THE MESSAGE, THERE IS MORE. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. THAT'S WHY GOD KEEP SENDING PREACHERS BECAUSE THERE IS MORE. IN EVERY GENERATION AT EVERY TIME. THERE IS MORE THAT GOD WANTS TO REVEAL. OTHERWISE, he would have only used one man, but there is more. Praise the name of the Lord. Oh my, I might be a little bit longer than usual, but are you are you are you listening? All right. So, let's let's carry on a little bit here. He says, "You you come and do so you you can't you come hook up with us because you can't do this unless you go with us." But they were just a little bit too late. God was already proving he was doing it with this man. He heard Jesus SAY, "WHOMSOEVER WILL, LET HIM COME. THE MAN WAS CHASING DEMON. THE one the disciples never understood. HE HAD JESUS WHO LET him come. He had the will and he came and started the job. Oh my goodness. Amen. Hallelujah. They were jealous because that this man was getting the job done. JEALOUS AT THE ALTAR [screaming] and they could not do it. This man was done doing getting the job done. And that's the way it is today. Who starts a jealousy? Is men in great prestige sometimes? Who starts it? Many times it's a man. He says it is great prestige. Men in great prestige sometimes who because of different denominational barriers also so prestige they are afraid to come out and tell their church that the Holy Spirit lives today to make intercessions [snorts] and and will heal our sickness today just the same as he did then. Listen listen, are you listening? And is jealousy because it's not in their denomination, not in their social ranks. God, listen, are you hearing me now? But God can deal in any rank that he wants to deal in. Amen. Amen. God can deal in any round. That is his own sovereign will. Oh, how little that we can be sometimes on those things and it does nothing but stand in the way of a real believer. Yeah, those things, you know, stand in the way of a real believer. The other brother is playing better than me. God bless you, brother. Brilliant. That brother is playing better than trying. I can't even play. I can't play again. But brother, jealousy, just know your place. You are you and you are you alone. Nobody like you. Some preachers are even afraid of inviting some preachers on their pullpit. because I'm talking about the altar. I can talk about that. Ah, how come I invite brother Seawa to come and preach yet I know his ministry. Let me protect my sheep. Listen, this message is not like the Pentecostal denomination. It does not come as to connect us around one man, two men or three men. It has come to connect us with Jesus Christ. Who is Jesus Christ? Is the bishop of our soul. Amen. Hallelujah. God gives us pastors in every local assembly. BROTHER SAYS, "GIVE THEM RESPECTS." But if you BELIEVE IN YOUR PASTOR AND YOU GIVE HIM RESPECT, GOD WILL USE him to take you through. But if YOU DON'T GIVE THAT MAN RESP HERE, that Sunday, the other Sunday they are there. The other Sunday they are there. I don't believe that either. That is wrong. It's wrong. We are all members of one church, but each of us has a home fellowship. where we are supposed to be and and and support the cause and then if there's a convention or gathering and everybody's gathering so right don't even wait to ask me by the way members of days of the voice don't even wait to ask me pastor should I go unless we have our own program Please go. We are free. Why? Because we are not a denomination. I'll deal with a little more here then I'll put it to a pause. Now in Genesis 4 vers 3. And in the and in process of time it came to pass that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord. And Abel he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof. And the Lord had respect unto Abel unto his offering. But unto Cain unto his offering, he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell. And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? And why is thy countenance fallen? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted. And if thou doest not well, sin lith at the door. And unto thee shall be his desire, and I shall rule over him. And Cain talked with Abel his brother. And it came to pass when they were in the field that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and slew him. And the Lord said unto Cain, "Where is thy brother Abel?" And he said, "I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?" And he said, "What hast thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cereth unto me from the ground, and now at thou cast from the earth, which has opened her mouth to um to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand." Praise the name of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord. Cain kills his brother. What was the reason? Jealousy. Where was the jealousy started from? Where was it exactly? At the altar. At the altar. God have mercy. But says, "Now we find out that because that Cain listened to the enemy, then what happened? He become the first murderer. He become the first one that had jealousy on earth. Tell me where that pure line from God to Adam. That's only that's the only connection. Adam was the son of God. The Bible said. So then where did that jealousy come from? Ask your neighbor, where did that jealousy, did it come from Adam? It couldn't have. It come from Satan. It's exactly where it come from. Now, we find out that he was the first murderer and he was the first one to have jealousy. He was the very first one to have jealous and Lucifer got jealous of Michael. Please listen. Please listen. He brought it down to the earth and transferred it into man. Kain by taking on this evil took the first mark. God marked him. No one was no one was to kill him. You know that mark I remember there was some people singing. He said uh then one pastor was praying. He said oh God give these people the mark of Cain so that nobody will touch them so that they will be untouchable. Lack of revelation is a very dangerous thing. The mark of the of Kane is the mark of the beast. The Bible says in the tribulation, those who shall receive the mark that they will not be touched. Why? They will leave. They will not be persecuted because they will already be in the system. But the ones who will not have the mark, they will be persecuted. They will be killed. But those will be the foolish virgins. So they will have eternal life and they will have to pay it with their own. But here we see the first time this marker was given the mark of the beast. It was given to Cain. Praise the name of the Lord. It was given to Kane. Excuse me. And Cain received the mark of the beast. Why did he receive the mark of the beast? Kane received the mark of the beast. Because he was a son of the serpent. Number one. Number two. He refused to repent. And that's the very first man that had jealousy. Jealousy is a bad thing. Never entertain jealousy in your heart. A man that knows his place cannot have jealousy. A woman who knows her place can entertain jealousy. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sisters who are married here. Jealousies of the devil. If you know your place, never entertain jealous in your heart. And marriage is built on trust. If you trust that your husband truly loves you, that is all that matters. Love him back. Some women are so jealous. The husband will pick a phone call. Who are you talking to? Who are you? What is that? Jealousy. Jealousy. And that breaks families, that breaks home. But if you know your husband loves you, all right. Hello. Yeah. I love you, too. You won't even come. WHO IS THAT ONE? You know, he will tell me anyway. No problem. He will tell me. And then soon soon sooner or later you say by the dinner I was talking to my mom is she talking to the morning but if you had been jealousy and maybe a SEED THERE IS closed and then he also ANGER YOU AND HE SLAPS you and then you meeting you saying I'm going home and then he's marrying another girl. Jealousy. Let me tell you this same jealousy is also at the altar. It's a bad thing. JEALOUSY [screaming] AT THE ALTAR IS THE WORST CASE. BOTH THESE BROTHERS CAME TO GIVE AN OFFERING TO THE LORD. I WISH KNEW HIS PLACE. YOU WOULD NOT EVEN HAVE FELT bad because sometimes the person you're having jealousy over is not even meant to be in your future. Sincerely, think about Kane and Abel. Kane could never take place no matter what Kane did. Was it possible? Completely impossible. Kane was of another seat. Abel was of another seat. No matter what Kane would do, he can never take Abel's place. So they give an offering brought the beautiful fruit. Kane brought the beautiful fruit. Wonderful smelling nice. You know fruits they can so look so nice. and he put it at the altar. Which song do you think he was singing that morning as he was giving his offering? Bringing in the sheep. Bringing in the sheep. Bringing in the sheep. Me, my son Kane. Your son Kane, Lord. Oh, bringing in. And he put everything. He was putting the upjuities shall come and then at the end of the day he brought the fire the fire. What does say send your power just now? Oh Lord, send your power and baptize all these fruits. And at that moment when he put the fire, of course he had to sing another song. Now the smoke was going before the praise. Praise the name of the Lord. And as the as as the smoke was going up, oh, he was so happy and overjoyed. I feel the and and and as it was going up, it reached somewhere and God was choking said back and Kane was like what said okay let me first calm myself maybe I did a mistake let me see what my brother will do and the same same way I bear he went in his flock Bringing in the sea. Bringing in the as he brought it to the altar. He brought a stone and then he he got the sheep, put at the altar and put up the neck and cut the throat. OH, IT shall come rejoicing, ringing. And at that moment, the song changed when blood came over him. Oh, the blood of Jes. What's that? Oh, that is so disgusting. Look at the blood. Even the song I don't like it. What kind of song is that with the blood all over him? Mine is better. I'm sure God is pleased with me more. But we shall see. We shall see because we have brought very clean offerings. And by the end of the offering at the altar, Cain also brought the fire. Say, "OH LORD, SEND YOUR POWER JUST NOW. LORD, send your power just now. [screaming] ALL THE SAME same way and the smoke began as it reached before the throne of God was I believe he called one of the angels give me THE NEWS WHAT IS THAT SMELLING SO NICE [screaming] bring it on [groaning] who is that YOUR SON I KNEW TAKE A DAY AND AND WHEN THAT happened Kane was like what I'm sure these brothers we are both spiritual so they must have seen what was going on they were seeing WHAT WAS GOING ON AND CAME SAID WHAT I OFFERED THE BEST SACRIFICE GOD NEVER ACCEPTED IT from that moment wow The word jealousy was formed for he began feeling bad about his brother. And let me tell you, brother, sister, if you're here and you have jealousy, just know it doesn't come from God. Jealousy is of the devil. AND CAIN WAS THE FIRST TO HAVE JEALOUSY. So it MEANS HE LOVES MORE THAN HE LOVES ME. IT MEANS HE LOVED HIS SACRIFICE BETTER THAN MINE. [gasps] How could he be so ruthless? And at that moment, God saw what was going on. So he told Gabriel, "Prepare my chariot, we are going down, let me see my boy, and I will talk to him." And in a moment in a then God came on the earth and he met Kane SAID HELLO ANYBODY HOME. HE SAYS YES FATHER I'M HERE and and GOD TOLD KANE YES MY SON WHY ART thou what is happening? You know some people they like being angry sad. If you're always like that is a wrong spirit on you times that spirit is not brought it doesn't come on itself. It comes with other spirits behind it. It comes with anger, jealousy, envy. SO NOW CAIN WAS ANGRY. HE WAS SAD. his coldness had fallen. SO GOD TOLD HIM, "WHY ARE YOU LIKE THAT?" HE SAID, "I don't even know." And God said, "If you do well, won't I receive you also and accept your offering?" came in at that moment God thought he was preaching a powerful sermon and at that moment he was just firing up that jealousy in Cain. WHAT IS HE TRYING TO SAY THAT I DID NOT DO WELL the way I I brought those fruits the way I handled them? The way I the way I wash him, he wants me to go and do that thing that Abel was saying. Cain was jealous. And that moment God told him, "Go and do that. I'll receive you." And Kane was like, "Okay, okay, okay." But in his heart, He knows he had that jealousy. He didn't know his place. If he had known his place, by the way, he would have repented and done well. So even when you're bad, if you know your place, it will help you. At that moment when God left, he told his brother, "Brother, my brother, my dear brother, come I take you somewhere." So they went somewhere. Brother, you know, God came and that someone really touched me. So I'd like to go and see how you're doing in your field. Brother Abel was having clean heart. told me it's all right. Let's go my brother. As they were there in the field of he looked here, no angel, no God, no deacon, no. got the neck of got a stone squeezed his neck and the man died. He said, "Now we shall see. We shall see which offering he will receive buried him in the sand and and he cleaned himself. He came back." HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. And I'm ready for the service today and God came down. The service started who song that day. He was even very spiritual. OH [screaming] LORD SEND POWER JUST HALLELUJAH. YES SIR. AMEN. But he knew what he had done. He knew what he had done. Brother, let me tell you, jealousy is a bad demon. And at that time, when God came, he said, I'm cursing you. But before he did that, he told him, "Where is your brother? Where is your brother?" Elizabeth, come back. I want you to hear this part. And at that moment, he God and I'm about to finish. God looked at Cain and he asked him a question. He said, "Where is your brother?" The man who was spiritual turned, "Am I my brother's keeper? When did you make him keep We should be our brother's keeper. You should always check on them. If you don't see somebody in church, call them. Is everything all right? We should be our brother's keep. And and at that moment, things happened. And then God told Cain because you didn't do well. Now I'm placing a cast on you and I'm putting a mark. Whoever sees you will not kill you. And God and and Kane knew what this man. [screaming] You have given me a very strong punishment. And God said, you know, at that moment Kane would have repented. But he did not. Jealousy. Friends, jealousy at the altar is the worst thing. If you if God has given you your place, maintain your place. In Romans 12:4 it says, "For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office, so we being many are one body in Christ, and everyone members of one another. Having then gifts, listen, if you have a Bible, read as I I read because of time the brother will not read this. Having then gifts deferring according to the grace that is given to us. Where the prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith. Or ministry, let us wait on min on our ministering. Oh, he that teacheth on teaching. Or he that exhortth on exhortation. He that giveth, let him do it with simplicity. He that ruleth with diligence. He that showeth mercy with cheerfulness. And here is what I wanted to say. Each of us is special. Tell somebody, no one can take an No one can take your place. So we need one another to be a fully functional body. No one can take another's place even in the church. That's why you need to be here at the services. Don't say well I'm a little nobody. Nobody. You have your place in the flesh. Joseph, another believer. He couldn't help being what he was. Joseph, he was a prophet. God made him a prophet. He didn't want to be different from his brother. But he was different. God made him what he is. Nobody else could take HIS PLACE. NOBODY ELSE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. GOD HAS MADE YOU WHAT YOU ARE. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. EVEN IN YOUR FAMILY, even in your church, even in your place of work, EVEN AT YOUR COMMUNITY, NO [screaming] ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. Nobody can take your place. NO MATTER HOW LITTLE YOU ARE. SO WHY HAVE JEALOUSY? WHY HAVE ENVY? YOU ARE SPECIAL. NO ONE CAN EVER TAKE YOUR PLACE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. You say I'm just a housewife. NOBODY CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. GOD IN HIS GREAT ECONOMY. He has SAID SO THE BODY OF CHRIST IN ORDER. [screaming] AMEN. IN ORDER TILL THERE IS NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. THIS IS YOUR PROPHET SAYING THAT. I say believe it in the NAME OF JESUS CHRIST. NO ONE CAN TAKE YOUR PLACE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AND BROTHER BAMIR SAYS, "OH, HOW I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE BROTHER BILLY GRAHAM'S PLACE, any of us ministers, BUT WE CANNOT DO IT. BUT REMEMBER, BILLY CAN'T TAKE OUR PLACE. BILLY, WE ALL HAVE A PLACE. ONE PASTOR SOMEWHERE ELSE HAVE HIS PLACE. Another pastor has his place. AS HERE MYSELF, I HAVE MY PLACE. AND WHEN I'M MINISTERING, I DON'T LOOK AT OTHERS AND HAVE JEALOUSY. I don't look at OTHERS AND HAVE ENVY. I KNOW MY PLACE IN CHRIST. AND I KNOW NOBODY can take my place. Nobody can take your place. Also, we all have pastors. Whatever we are, brother says, our housewives, some mechanics, some farmers, whatever it is, God has set you in your place. Praise the name of the Lord. There's a lot I had. I I I thought I would not finish it. But let me before we close, let us look a little bit about John the Baptist. And we shall close with that. Now John had baptized Jesus. And from there Jesus's ministry started. Now listen very closely now. And this caused more people. This caused more people to follow Jesus more than John. What do you think it made John's disciples feel? Let us see how they felt. John chapter 3:27. John answered and said, let us begin from 26. And they came unto John, and they said unto him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou beest witness. BEHOLD, THE SAME BAPTIZES, and all men come to him, PASTOR, YOU REMEMBER the brother who was fellowshipping here? The one you baptized? The one you groomed? Yes, I remember. He started a church there and he has more people than ours. If you were that pastor, what would you do? Let us see what Pastor John said to his. John answered and said, "A man can receive nothing except it be given him from above." He's saying we can only be what God HAS CALLED US TO BE. NO MAN CAN MAKE ANYTHING OF HIMSELF. IF HE DOES, IT WILL CRUMBLE. TRUE MEN OF GOD ARE GOD MADE, NOT SELFMADE. AND JOHN KNEW THAT. SO HE SAID, "WHATEVER HE IS, GOD HAS MADE HIM. DON'T BOTHER HIM WITH DON'T BOTHER ME WITH JESUS'S MINISTRY. HIS MINISTRIES OF GOD, LET HIM BE WHAT GOD HAS DONE. I HAVE NOTHING TO do with it. I ALSO HAVE MY OWN MINISTRY. AND WHEN HIS MINISTRY WAS FINISHED, his head was cut off. No man can make him himself anything. cannot make himself an interpreter. If he makes himself, it will crumble. Brother Martin can't make himself a preacher. IF AT ALL THAT GIFT IS THERE, it means it is GIVEN TO HIM BY GOD THAT CANNOT CRUMBLE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BROTHERS ON THE MUSIC TEAM. WHATEVER YOU ARE, YOU DID NOT MAKE YOURSELF GOD HAS MADE YOU THAT. AND IF IT IS NOT GOD, IT WILL SURE CRUMBLE. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHATEVER GOD HAS MADE YOU, it will never crumble. Hallelujah. Amen. And I even say in this little fellowship here sometimes things happen like the other one left the church is going to crumble. I have never had those thoughts. There was a time when we were alone in the house here four five of us. The other place you became 10, 15, 25, 40. Some would go, some would come, some would go, some and people who are very good at coming to criticize, they be behind there talking. Brother, what do you feel these days in the church? The spirit is no longer there. The anointing is really even people, even people are dozing dozing. I think the speed has left us. Yeah. Yeah. And they begin moving those rumors. And then even the person who was active when they begin hearing that they will also say, "Yeah, but by the way, so when he comes to church, he will say, you will also be the anointing.
