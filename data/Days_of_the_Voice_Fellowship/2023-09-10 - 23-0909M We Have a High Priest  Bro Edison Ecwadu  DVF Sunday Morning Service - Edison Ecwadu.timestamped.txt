[1:21:32] presence of the
[1:21:35] Lord hallelujah hallelujah now from
[1:21:38] where we've read in the book of
[1:21:42] Hebrews the Bible tells us that we have
[1:21:44] a great high
[1:21:47] priest that is p
[1:21:51] heavens and that is Jesus the son of
[1:21:54] God now let us hold first our
[1:21:59] profession for we have not a high priest
[1:22:02] which cannot be touched with the feeling
[1:22:04] of
[1:22:07] infirmities Hallelujah but was in all
[1:22:09] points tempted like we
[1:22:13] are and yet he was found without
[1:22:17] sin Hallelujah
[1:22:19] Hallelujah Jesus said yes
[1:22:23] oh the Bible
[1:22:25] says that be ye
[1:22:29] perfect as your father in Heaven is
[1:22:33] perfect now one may
[1:22:36] ask how can one be
[1:22:39] perfect when you are still in the
[1:22:42] flesh Hallelujah now all things are
[1:22:45] possible to them that
[1:22:49] believe the Bible says I can do all
[1:22:51] things
[1:22:54] through him who strengthens
[1:22:57] me now as human beings we are
[1:23:00] limited as flesh and blood is where we
[1:23:04] end is where we reach and we say we
[1:23:08] cannot I can't
[1:23:11] continue enough is
[1:23:13] enough Hallelujah but Christ does not
[1:23:16] reach where he says I can give up now I
[1:23:18] can't hold it
[1:23:21] anymore
[1:23:23] praise the Lord and that is why the
[1:23:25] Bible says we have a high
[1:23:28] priest so if you want to
[1:23:31] overcome then cling to
[1:23:33] Christ praise the Lord because it is
[1:23:37] Christ to overcome for
[1:23:39] you now when you try to overcome by
[1:23:42] yourself you
[1:23:45] can't he says we have a high priest
[1:23:47] which can be touched by the feeling of
[1:23:51] INF I do not know which infirmity you
[1:23:55] have I do not know which weakness you
[1:23:57] have as a as a
[1:24:01] Believer but one thing I know each one
[1:24:04] of us has a point where you
[1:24:07] fail you may be perfect in all
[1:24:11] things you may observe everything and
[1:24:13] all is
[1:24:16] well but there's somewhere you reach
[1:24:18] that you also fail as a human
[1:24:21] being now we as human beings as
[1:24:26] Christians we have different
[1:24:29] weaknesses my weakness may not be the
[1:24:31] one brother
[1:24:34] has Hallelujah so one can
[1:24:37] say look at that
[1:24:40] brother he's taken 10 years in the
[1:24:43] message he's been a Christian for 10
[1:24:45] years
[1:24:46] now but look he still tells
[1:24:49] lies I have never told the lie since I
[1:24:51] believed
[1:24:54] but I wonder that brother is still
[1:24:55] struggling with a spirit of telling
[1:24:58] lies now telling Li is the simplest
[1:25:01] demon to
[1:25:04] overcome and I overcame it long time
[1:25:07] ago now I wonder what that brother is
[1:25:11] doing he can't just overcome a simple
[1:25:14] Spirit of telling a
[1:25:16] lie hallelujah hallelujah now brother
[1:25:20] hold your
[1:25:21] peace
[1:25:23] praise the Lord I may be struggling with
[1:25:26] a spirit of telling
[1:25:29] lies which you overcame years
[1:25:34] back praise the
[1:25:36] Lord don't criticize
[1:25:39] me because you may be struggling with a
[1:25:41] spirit of
[1:25:44] last which I also overcame long time
[1:25:51] ago praise the Lord then I look at you
[1:25:54] and
[1:25:55] say this one is still
[1:25:58] lasting and he says he's a
[1:26:01] Christian how can you last when you're a
[1:26:05] Christian I overcame that Spirit long
[1:26:07] long
[1:26:10] time praise the Lord I believe each one
[1:26:13] of us has a go a
[1:26:17] weakness something that fails
[1:26:20] you and you know that it's not
[1:26:23] good you know that as a Christian I
[1:26:25] shouldn't do
[1:26:27] this Hallelujah now you stop for a while
[1:26:30] and you try to avoid
[1:26:33] it now take for example you're F of
[1:26:36] telling
[1:26:38] lies and you know it's bad to tell
[1:26:41] lies the Bible does not allow us to tell
[1:26:44] lies so but you want to be a
[1:26:46] Christian you love the Lord with all
[1:26:48] your heart and you wouldn't want to hurt
[1:26:51] him by telling a lie
[1:26:53] praise the Lord and then you wake up one
[1:26:55] day and say from this day I don't want
[1:26:59] to tell a lie I'm not going to tell a
[1:27:02] lie anymore I'm going to try to speak
[1:27:04] the truth I'm going to try to be honest
[1:27:07] in everything that I do why because I've
[1:27:09] known that the spirit has taken me so
[1:27:12] long and I want to end it
[1:27:16] today praise the Lord you'll try that
[1:27:20] day you may be successful
[1:27:24] Hallelujah the second day you may also
[1:27:27] be successful up to
[1:27:30] midday but I want to tell you this
[1:27:32] before you know it you've told a
[1:27:37] lie praise be to God now yesterday you
[1:27:41] committed yourself not to tell a
[1:27:43] lie and you promised God but I'm not
[1:27:47] going to speak
[1:27:49] lies but you've broken your promise
[1:27:53] what am I telling us
[1:27:55] Church on your own you cannot
[1:27:59] stop and that's why we have a high
[1:28:03] priest and that's why Christ went to
[1:28:07] Calvary
[1:28:08] this church brother sister Jesus went to
[1:28:14] Calvary because he
[1:28:16] knew that you were going to be telling
[1:28:19] lies praise the Lord Jesus came and went
[1:28:23] to
[1:28:24] Calvary because he knew you were going
[1:28:26] to
[1:28:28] last Hallelujah there's silence in the
[1:28:33] house now if you are not going to be
[1:28:38] lasting if you are not going to be
[1:28:40] telling
[1:28:41] lies if you are not going to be
[1:28:43] qusome if you not going to be
[1:28:47] abused then Christ wouldn't have
[1:28:51] come praise the Lord now according to
[1:28:54] God's for
[1:28:57] knowledge he saw from the
[1:29:01] beginning before even the
[1:29:04] beginning praise the Lord before he said
[1:29:07] let there be
[1:29:08] [Music]
[1:29:09] light he had seen
[1:29:12] you praise the Lord and he had seen all
[1:29:15] through your
[1:29:18] life right from the time before your
[1:29:21] parents met
[1:29:21] [Music]
[1:29:24] and before you were even
[1:29:26] conceived and before you were born into
[1:29:28] this
[1:29:29] world God had seen your
[1:29:32] life and he had seen what you were going
[1:29:35] to go
[1:29:36] through he had prepared a program for
[1:29:39] you Hallelujah and he
[1:29:43] knew that you were going to stray
[1:29:48] off now uh God does not make mistakes
[1:29:53] you may
[1:29:54] say now brother you're saying God knew
[1:29:59] everything how did he fail to know that
[1:30:01] the devil was going to
[1:30:05] come and sin would
[1:30:09] rain praise the Lord now hear
[1:30:13] this God had a
[1:30:16] plan now the devil thought he had
[1:30:19] won praise the Lord little did he know
[1:30:24] that Christ had seen
[1:30:27] everything and he came with a Plan of
[1:30:31] Salvation he had a Plan of Salvation
[1:30:34] before he could say let there be
[1:30:37] light God knew he was going to create a
[1:30:40] body for himself to dwell in that he may
[1:30:42] bring
[1:30:46] Salvation before he said let there
[1:30:50] be so God in his forign
[1:30:54] knowledge had everything in
[1:30:57] place before there was one single
[1:31:02] demon god had prepared a
[1:31:05] plan even for that
[1:31:10] weakness blessed be the name of the
[1:31:14] Lord he's a high
[1:31:17] priest we have a high
[1:31:19] priest which can be touched
[1:31:22] by the feeling of our
[1:31:25] infirmities the Bible says Christ was
[1:31:27] tempted in all things and yet without
[1:31:33] sin what are you going through
[1:31:36] today I don't know which Spirit disturbs
[1:31:40] you Hallelujah I want to tell you it
[1:31:43] Disturbed
[1:31:45] Christ praise the Lord and hear this
[1:31:50] when it Disturbed Christ
[1:31:53] Christ overcame
[1:31:54] it and then he gave us the method of
[1:31:57] overcoming he said resist the devil and
[1:32:00] shall flee from
[1:32:04] you now brother
[1:32:06] says Jesus
[1:32:11] conquered what did he
[1:32:13] conquer he conquered every gate of the
[1:32:17] en and then he told
[1:32:20] us to go
[1:32:23] possess the gates of the
[1:32:25] enemy now ours is not to conquer
[1:32:30] anymore because Christ has already
[1:32:34] conquered now ours is to
[1:32:37] possess brother possess that
[1:32:41] blessing possess that blessing
[1:32:44] sister why because Christ went
[1:32:48] before he's a high
[1:32:50] priest went to Calvary in your
[1:32:53] place now we are not going to Calvary
[1:32:57] again why because Christ finished
[1:33:00] Calvary ours is to
[1:33:03] possess
[1:33:05] Hallelujah I pray that God reveals it to
[1:33:07] you
[1:33:09] tonight that yours is not normal to
[1:33:13] conquer because Christ
[1:33:16] conquer your is to possess the
[1:33:19] blessings which Christ
[1:33:23] for hallelujah hallelujah what is that
[1:33:26] that you desire from
[1:33:28] God do you want
[1:33:30] victory over the spirit of
[1:33:33] last there are so many promises in the
[1:33:37] Bible that we have been
[1:33:40] given and we are supposed to possess
[1:33:45] them and because they belong to
[1:33:48] us and that's why the Bible tells us
[1:33:52] that we have a high
[1:33:53] priest who which which can be touched by
[1:33:56] the feeling of our
[1:33:57] family now he says come with
[1:34:03] boldness hallelujah hallelujah now I
[1:34:06] want to ask you a
[1:34:07] question what makes you to come with
[1:34:12] boldness Hallelujah you have a
[1:34:17] weakness you you are doing things that
[1:34:19] you know they don't please God
[1:34:23] and then where do you gather where do
[1:34:24] you sumon the
[1:34:28] courage where do you get the boldness to
[1:34:32] come seeing that you have a
[1:34:36] weakness Paul said for the thing I be
[1:34:39] the Lord
[1:34:42] th that it may depart from
[1:34:44] me and then he said my grace is
[1:34:47] sufficient for
[1:34:50] you why did he go to seek
[1:34:54] God it was because he had a weakness
[1:34:56] that he could not
[1:34:59] overcome he had something that he could
[1:35:01] not
[1:35:03] help Hallelujah the Bible says come now
[1:35:06] with
[1:35:07] boldness what makes you
[1:35:11] bold
[1:35:12] Hallelujah it is
[1:35:15] because it is
[1:35:18] because he said
[1:35:20] come
[1:35:22] praise the
[1:35:23] Lord and once he said once he says
[1:35:27] come it means it belongs to
[1:35:31] you I want to give an
[1:35:34] example if you are if there's a function
[1:35:37] that has been
[1:35:41] organized and you've been
[1:35:44] invited you have an invitation
[1:35:48] card that means you a guest you are

[1:36:11] you

[1:36:54] somewhere and wait for the invited guest
[1:36:56] to First
[1:36:58] enter and then when they after they
[1:37:01] enter and then you will try to find your
[1:37:03] way
[1:37:04] in and then you will make sure there's
[1:37:06] no one at the gate before you
[1:37:08] enter why because you are not sure that
[1:37:10] you you'll be allowed
[1:37:13] in you fear that you may be thrown
[1:37:16] out why because you know that you don't
[1:37:19] have an invitation card

[1:37:24] function Hallelujah but when you are
[1:37:26] expected to come that means even if

[1:37:43] if you are
[1:37:44] sure now that the Bible has given us an
[1:37:48] invitation and it tells us that we have
[1:37:50] a high priest
[1:37:51] and the one calling on us he says come
[1:37:54] with boldness to the throne of
[1:37:57] grace and we come with that boldness not
[1:38:00] for
[1:38:02] sure we don't just come to to to

[1:38:24] have that weakness that spirit that has
[1:38:26] bothered you for long then you do not

[1:41:56] saint why the blood of
[1:41:59] Christ has power to
[1:42:03] transform Hallelujah and that's why the
[1:42:06] devil cannot accuse you
[1:42:09] anymore why because the devil cannot
[1:42:12] cannot find
[1:42:15] proof that you committed
[1:42:19] it as long as the blood has been
[1:42:22] shed you know the devil tries to go and
[1:42:24] accuse
[1:42:25] you and says see the one you call your
[1:42:29] son yesterday he did this this afternoon
[1:42:33] he again did

[1:43:21] that's not enough today again he has
[1:43:24] quar with the
[1:43:25] neighbor then Christ will

[2:21:42] blood the Indians could not help
[2:21:44] you Hallelujah
[2:21:49] now hear
[2:21:50] this now she had been pledged with a
[2:21:53] hemorrhage for years and
[2:21:56] years she spent all her money to the
[2:22:00] doctors and the doctors do her any
[2:22:03] good now she heard Jesus was down there
[2:22:06] at the

[2:22:26] the crowd and touched His
[2:22:29] Garment hallelujah amen and she turned
[2:22:32] around and went back into the
[2:22:34] audience Jesus stopped now remember when
[2:22:38] we are talking about this the Bible
[2:22:40] tells us we have a high
[2:22:42] priest which can be
[2:22:45] touched by the feeling of infirmities
[2:22:48] now this one touched
[2:22:49] Jesus and disappeared into the
[2:22:52] crowd Jesus said Jesus stopped and who
[2:22:55] touched
[2:22:57] meu felt
[2:22:59] it hallelujah amen Jesus felt inity of
[2:23:03] this
[2:23:05] woman no
[2:23:07] wonder everybody denied it Jes said but
[2:23:12] I perceive that virtue is gone out of
[2:23:15] me strength I got weak Somebody Touched
[2:23:19] Me Apostle said but why do you say
[2:23:22] somebody touched everybody is touching
[2:23:25] me Hallelujah he says now that is what

[2:23:29] today now with your education your
[2:23:33] imagination you might do all kinds of
[2:23:37] touching Hallelujah but that's not the
[2:23:39] touch that
[2:23:43] will it a thatou we are talking about
[2:23:47] we are talking about the touch that
[2:23:49] brings a
[2:23:52] result the touch that picks virtue out
[2:23:55] of
[2:23:58] Christ
[2:24:01] not we need
[2:24:03] touch that is able to stop
[2:24:06] him from doing
[2:24:09] everything and turns back to address
[2:24:12] your
[2:24:14] case hallelujah hallelujah a touch Jesus
[2:24:18] said I perceived strength has come out
[2:24:21] of
[2:24:22] me that's why the Bible says he became
[2:24:25] us that we may become
[2:24:27] him Jesus got weak why because this
[2:24:32] woman took away the
[2:24:35] strength and give weakness in exchange
[2:24:38] of the strength oh
[2:24:45] Hallelujah
[2:24:50] hallelujah amen that's what
[2:24:54] church go with your
[2:24:57] weakness with that weakness make Christ
[2:25:02] weak Hallelujah and then you become
[2:25:05] strong Hallelujah am it is doable
[2:25:10] church that's why Christ is saying
[2:25:13] come come to the throne of grace that I
[2:25:16] may become weak and you become
[2:25:19] stronger he's willing to become weak for
[2:25:23] you because he loves
[2:25:26] you love conquers
[2:25:28] [Applause]
[2:25:29] everything blessed be the name of the
[2:25:31] Lord Christ is more than
[2:25:34] willing to become
[2:25:36] weak and you take his
[2:25:38] strength amen hallelujah so we need a
[2:25:42] touch that picks virtue out
[2:25:45] of
[2:25:48] now listen this what says if he could be
[2:25:51] touched that day with the feeling of
[2:25:53] their
[2:25:57] infirmities the Bible tells us in
[2:25:59] Hebrews that he could be touched today
[2:26:01] with a feeling
[2:26:04] of he a high
[2:26:06] priest that can be touched by the
[2:26:08] feeling of
[2:26:09] infirmities is that right church then if
[2:26:13] you can touch him
[2:26:15] today hear this if you can only touch
[2:26:18] him
[2:26:18] today you are bound to get the same
[2:26:21] results that

[2:26:31] weakness and she became strong and
[2:26:34] Christ got weak you can also touch him
[2:26:37] today that weakness and Christ will get
[2:26:41] weak you will get strong Jesus Christ

[2:26:56] weakness and you will get
[2:26:57] weak praise the Lord am and you will get
[2:27:02] strong if he's risen
[2:27:05] tonight among the people

[2:27:13] things has got to take place
[2:27:15] today
