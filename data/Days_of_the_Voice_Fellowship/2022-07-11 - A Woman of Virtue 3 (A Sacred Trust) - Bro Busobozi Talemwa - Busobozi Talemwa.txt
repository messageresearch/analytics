========================================

the lord i will fly away i will not die tell your brother your sister i will not die i will fly away hallelujah this morning i want to greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ christopher thank you for coming in the house of the lord this morning coming you have your bibles we go to genesis chapter two bible you have a virginia [Music] i'm happy to see my brother here the saint proclaimed was baptized on sunday yeah that is sandy also the other brother who was baptized on sunday i think his name is brother and the lord god took the man and put him in the into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it underneath the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slept and he took one of the of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead they wrote down [Music] and the rib which the lord god had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man [Music] and flesh of my flesh she shall be called a woman because she was taken out of man um shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh to know that even as adam was taken even as eve was taken out of adams we have also been taken out of you now the man i'm such a we are the female part in that fetching rich because we are the church veganism we are the bride of god and we have come here this morning so that you can fashion us into your image that we will be pleasing to you took a sentence even my sincere prayer this morning you always see my childhood pleasing to you that whatsoever we do move your nadia we will be pleasing to you bless everyone lord why would your mum say brother every sister some workers have a long ways to be here unless they're heartbroken may this service be a blessing to everyone who foreign a woman of virtue part 3. can you get a better word and then but this morning i'm specifically speaking on a sacred trust i'm requesting that you uh put your undivided attention to the word movements as much as we can see because trust is a wonderful thing and then a trust uh is something that is given to someone checking to achieve when now the person who has received the trust is can be called a trustee and the trustee does not necessarily benefit directly from the trust but listen that trust is given to him for the benefit of others what would i take one more way but before we talk about the sacred trust that god has given please let's look at um at adam adam the bible says that the lord god formed man and if you look at verse 16 of chapter two he says and the lord god formed the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the god and thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that you eat there shall surely die now this was a sacred track the lord who had entrusted to adam catherine adams god had given his word to his son and which comes to mind which is the tree of knowledge of good and evil of the gods but there was also the tree of knowledge of good and evil this was the second category also in the middle of the night now the tree of good of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life we are only figurative trees it meant something more than just trees [Music] the image of god furniture why because he was eating from the tree of life the lord of glory this morning come away praise the name of the lord and so he told this man he came on earth and he told us we could eat him and he told us you could drink him because his brother was food and his blood was drinking which happened and he [Music] i am but within it has good and evil that was the man of sin he was the devil himself the bible says he was found in the garden of god praise the name of the lord [Music] [Music] that was and adam's saying now this is one of my bones and flesh of my flesh you shall be called a woman because she was taken out of it but then what happened after that night god has entrusted me with keeping this word for me we should never eat of this when the suffering came down he guided the woman said the serpent beguiled me and i did it praise the name of the lord my misery i'm keeping quiet for a moment because i wanted to imagine god himself trusting you if he trusts you well i'm so happy to see mr john trust you it means he has confidence in him it means he has decided to treat you as a trustee he believes that you will keep the trust always he believes in you um adam was the image of god himself [Music] [Music] [Music] listen now but the woman being deceived was in the transgression so the woman was deceived [Music] and because she was the one who was deceived [Music] she was in the transgression in genesis as you say this happened because [Music] [Music] when's the churchy all of you know what i doubt you my nobody's the movement so the scripture says that the woman was committed adultery she says after she has done it [Music] the first woman she was not able to keep the sacred tracks there are so many ways but god being gone and jesus christ yes christians the second half amen because the first one through him as long as we were born by the life of the first adam adam you may think you are alive but you are actually dead hallelujah you are dead even before let me tell you the moment you were born what you begin to die did you know that what do you mean the moment you are born you begin to die giving testimony oh my body was like oh but god healed me because we are is you are the second woman the church the canister you will not fall don't just walk let me let me prove it to you here the country is was actually in the body of jesus christ oh there is only one card hallelujah amen and that god is the spirit that's under your mouth john chapter four twenty twenty one twenty five believe your god god is the spirit hallelujah my father jesus was the body of god and christ christo in his body the bride someone didn't get it god [Music] the hope of my glory and christ is manifesting himself and she failed now then god has taken from the body of christ he has taken his flesh in his body which is his wife oh i cannot believe it is why i have been taken out of the body of christ christo but she is coming back with a pure undoubtedly word of [Music] hallelujah [Music] this message [Music] [Music] that was my decoration declaration my hope is not in the church my hope is in christ in christ there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus christ yes who walk not after the flesh for the spirit getting crushed one time you ain't gonna come across the world hallelujah that's why i can't understand that in this message so much and talk about their pastors in their mouth more than oh oh some great heritage that belongs to us over scrubbing our friends that those if you know what the word of god says don't compromise thinking god will help you follow us to achieve your purpose the moment you begin to compromise on the world botanical quake the moment you have lost it don't compromise don't compromise dress you act like the world wait gamble even if you don't feel like it never act like it goes don't move chibago that's what we must do to take care of us what god is looking for [Applause] hallelujah amen i remember when we were coming down [Music] yes god said you should suckle go around wait i'm gonna go around again go around i don't feel like it situation do it i shout i believe once we are going out close some little foolish people seriously good for nothing people going around our city they have uh [Music] hallelujah [Music] something [Applause] and he says here let's go back just a few minutes and find those men who kept god's great sacrifice that was his words amen oh glory to god hallelujah [Music] [Music] the word of god [Music] when which way are covered by all the spirits of egypt all day spiritually with your now all the demons [Music] [Applause] it is only jesus that we need yesterday we don't jesus he came with one road don't worry which we can't [Music] in a sacred trust he had a sacred trust the idea where it was that was given to him god himself he told him what did he come back i've given you my word requests i've trusted you to me i've sent you again the mystery go to egypt i will stand before you what you will speak it will be as good point put it down we're going to focus it is going to become a snake yes stand on 20 minutes we know what we are talking about that's why we cannot be fired to our father we can't be quiet because we have a cause we have a message we know what we are talking about because they know what they're talking about i'm giving you only three months ago and hallelujah amen let them give us one month look at that [Applause] we oh the serpents of egypt that had all the ghosts and powers of egypt was now in the road of power that moses has anything praise the lord amen praise the lord and before i conclude it never come out elisa i'm going to look at it in the physical as well but this is also meant to talk about the spiritual eh brother speaks of the three sacred virtues a woman has can you give me that this is a woman is then trusted with certain characters omokazee arena [Music] not amen right hallelujah i mean praise the lord i'm ambassador and there is not a creature on earth like a woman there is no female dog there is no female of any kind they worry you chickazi movie cave you're not entrusted with the character that a woman is hey no name oh my god she must a woman was not even in the beginning of creation [Music] because god knew that she would fall down all other females could not commit adultery have been this complementary to god's great wisdom but because she was cast over in that side [Music] [Applause] she's got characters that she must not be fired praise the lord even god himself look at tonight and you just think about this moment when he came to it to mary maria he didn't come commanding around some of you men who think you just command the women around but your mother wasn't your doctor honoring her yesterday because it one of the reasons why you're a blessed sister because god has given you this church sacred trust bring life listen there are three sacred virtues and the prophet says if she would murder him [Music] she is defiled for [Music] but she cannot be justified in this life always with her name not just now she is being given this yeah watching she may be forgiven but not justified in god never because it was given to bring forth life into underground god himself among a man he needed a body now here is where you may disagree he's saying when you go what can you do many of you theologians and i'm happy you have nothing religion in the muslims that's what defiled the whole human race for those twins to children such descriptions we find that our body is the bedding you know uh women cannot vote it is their rights even almost up to 9 months [Music] [Music] watch these things on the internet movie never internet it's everywhere in the movies it's everywhere i will film with you the devil has reduced the woman to nothing and yet she's the most precious now i'm speaking now bringing this to an illustration to show you where the church stands i am not speaking of you women whatever you are naturally that's between you and god [Music] is given to bring forth life that god only god himself can give uh [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now this is given to bring forth the life that god only himself can keep programming her husband might be the jumper but god has to produce the life it has to come all life has to come from god oblivion will never very catholic and a life come from god remember very catholic is perverted and that's what makes it sinful but life has to come from god is keep the church in mind while i'm speaking this natural this to a natural woman said in the seventh chapter of romans she has a sacred trust of virtue oh forward if she even does something wrong never correct jump she must confess that to her husband before he takes her i know and make it right now this kind of trust of virtue always that boy who wants marriage are you a vagina are you virtuous he has [Music] the same as the church that was married to if she doesn't then she sleeps with her husband for 10 years and then confess it he has a right to put her away that is scripture and i always told the brethren uganda if you married your wife as a virtuous woman really yeah really but now yeah the problem is with the man well you're about to listen to this there them right behind the pastor brother cool down and then afterwards i'll ask you of adultery that's not scripture only it is allowed if she committed fornication all right let's skip a bit here notice now she has a sacred trust [Music] just as it was in the just as it was in the garden of eden she can say yes oh no she had a sacred trust i don't know where of look on this screen look on the screen and see this movie starts kissing and hugging and sloping around with women a woman does that is of a bad character oh my god but see when those six glands are in the lips he says the money kisses a woman he's actually potentially committed adultery homosexuals it wouldn't mix through their sex glands but the sex glance is in the lips but what kind of generation we are having we're truly no wonder our morals are rotten and decayed and filthy because it is put before the children [Music] womanhood for where she can see whereby she shouldn't allow men to touch her body did you know that even the government sister allows you to go and see a man that has touched your body anyhow did you know that the government [Music] [Applause] as an immoral object engaged into the away and so that's why even the devil has gone to women standing against the weather told them to undress their [Music] [Music] let me tell you it's because [Applause] [Music] [Music] then you're fine i want to worry about you [Music] [Music] in a way that shows you all from a different [Music] the lowest and the immortalist and most filthy fit on earth is a woman when she's back at them the lowest yeah right and low and immortalists and the most precious jewel attaching jericho since the omundo that is to a man a real message besides his salvation because jacob is a good woman if i tell you my wife is sick and i didn't come to church don't blame me if i tell you i couldn't preach because i was there taking my wife to the hospital to deliver a child you can't blame me my first priority [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you need another [Applause] is hallelujah praise the name of the lord amen hallelujah and listen to this last quote here the god of america is a woman catholic american and i want to say that god of the world is a woman catholic that's right it's a true french strip one of these little women off my mother and

name which looks like a zip stand that has gone anger yeah yeah you say where you can kind of see and they have their brothers down and they're jumping where is the narrow way another way is the way of the watch [Music] gamble is the way of holiness the way of righteousness is that's the reason he chose the woman the table because the woman is redeemed the woman is redeemed and she can be a sister ungodly but brother what we need today is some more good old-fashioned thing holy ghost mother strange children right they don't even think about what type of what type of children will this
