[40:59] in the name of jesus christ amen amen
[41:04] amen so we are speaking
[41:08] on these three things once again this
[41:10] morning
[41:11] [Music]
[41:14] and uh i once again would like to
[41:17] request you to be very very attentive
[41:23] be very attentive so that you can be
[41:26] able to hear and not miss
[41:28] anything that they always have for you
[41:29] this morning
[41:40] [Music]
[41:46] he is this the one that has been
[41:48] attending our bible studies brother
[41:50] cello
[41:50] brother you can just have your hands if
[41:52] that's okay yeah
[41:53] all right yeah god bless you god bless
[41:55] you brother
[41:57] it's good to have you once again
[42:01] brothers over there from kenya uganda
[42:03] kenya
[42:04] amen i mean all right now this morning
[42:08] i just want to continue on with the
[42:10] subject that we have been dealing with
[42:12] for
[42:13] two weeks now
[42:23] and as i said i would like it to be very
[42:26] attractive
[42:28] you got so that you will be able to take
[42:31] out something from the service this
[42:33] morning
[42:36] pray for me and my brother henry i'm
[42:38] gonna be angry
[42:39] that the holy spirit will be able to use
[42:41] us to bless you
[42:55] and avoid movements as much as you can
[42:58] [Music]
[43:00] amen now
[43:04] in the first instance we dealt with
[43:07] the lust of the flesh
[43:10] why and i know i had many people
[43:14] who would say ah is this even also the
[43:17] last of the flesh even this one even
[43:18] that one
[43:33] [Music]
[43:58] [Music]
[44:04] but also do not love the things that are
[44:06] in the world
[44:15] [Music]
[44:21] and summarizes them in this next verse
[44:30] for all that is in the world the last of
[44:32] the flesh
[44:33] the last of the eyes and the pride of
[44:35] life he says is not of the father but is
[44:38] of the world
[44:47] to be very
[44:50] so we notice that these things are not
[44:53] of the father they are not of god but
[44:54] they are of the world
[44:58] so the last of the flesh is not of god
[45:01] the last of the pride of the
[45:15] these three things are the source of
[45:17] your temptation
[45:19] yes these are the three doors the devil
[45:22] tempts
[45:23] anyone
[45:27] and for the last two weeks we have been
[45:30] looking
[45:44] we are
[45:57] there is no christianity
[46:00] if people have been overcome by these
[46:03] three things
[46:05] if christians get overcome by these
[46:07] three things there is no christianity
[46:12] it
[46:26] does not come as a devil he introduces
[46:29] himself and says hello
[46:30] i am the devil can you open for me
[46:33] [Music]
[46:37] that doesn't happen he only comes
[46:48] and so we already found out how we can
[46:50] overcome the last of the flesh
[47:08] and i will begin again as the past two
[47:11] services with this quote because
[47:12] really i wanted to understand this
[47:20] give it to me in matthew 4
[47:24] wherein jesus is tempted of the devil
[47:26] our yes
[47:28] he overcame the personal temptations of
[47:31] satan by the word
[47:36] he overcame the personal temptations
[47:40] of the devil by the way and he came
[47:43] in everyone was achieved by the word and
[47:48] by the word
[47:48] only everyone was a chicago
[48:04] way that we can defeat the devil just so
[48:07] when i sit anymore and with the chicken
[48:09] only by the water and he says in each of
[48:12] these three major triads that
[48:13] corresponded exactly to the temptation
[48:15] of the garden of eden
[48:46] disobedience to the world
[48:52] but jesus is overcame by the word
[48:57] hallelujah amen and right now let me say
[49:01] this
[49:02] is the only way to be an overcomer
[49:08] also it is the only way that you can
[49:09] know if you are overcoming
[49:14] because
[49:41] it is because of these three things
[50:06] [Music]
[50:09] the world cannot fail
[50:13] the church can fail manny can face your
[50:16] parents can fail
[50:17] everybody will fail the bible says let
[50:20] every man be a liar but god be
[50:24] true
[50:37] and i tell you whatever situation it is
[50:39] that you are fighting against in your
[50:40] life
[50:42] [Music]
[50:44] i have a solution for you and that
[50:46] solution is right here in the word of
[50:48] god
[50:50] because that world cannot fail
[51:04] [Applause]
[51:06] is
[51:17] [Applause]
[51:20] for christian facts almost christian
[51:24] it is a match for a christian to sing
[51:27] for a christian to pray
[51:31] for all these things but while we are
[51:34] still on this world today
[51:37] the greatest thing that will help us
[51:42] is the word of god
[51:45] because the world is god himself
[51:59] it will always accomplish its purpose
[52:12] you are able to overcome
[52:16] by
[52:25] [Music]
[52:28] he as god cannot overcome with anything
[52:31] else but
[52:32] his word
[52:36] and that is why he is our mighty
[52:38] conqueror
[52:42] there is no prophet there is no pope
[52:58] no it is our lord jesus christ
[53:02] that is why even when it comes to water
[53:04] baptism
[53:06] we baptize in the name of our lord jesus
[53:09] christ
[53:11] because that name
[53:26] of the
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:52] [Music]
[54:02] the devil was you know capturing all the
[54:05] believers who were dying
[54:08] satanic
[54:36] captivity
[54:49] [Applause]
[55:05] the world and you
[55:08] now can overcome by the same one
[55:13] hallelujah can you say it
[55:16] on your mouth in your home
[55:29] amen genesis
[55:40] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[55:42] good for food
[55:43] and that it was pleasant to the eyes and
[55:46] a pretty big desire to make one wise
[55:48] she took of the fruit thereof and did it
[55:50] and gave also
[55:51] and to her husband with her and he did
[55:54] it
[56:08] [Music]
[56:15] sister eve the bible says the reason why
[56:21] she desired the truth
[56:25] because of three things are you
[56:28] following me
[56:29] because of three things number one
[56:33] because the tree was good for food
[56:39] what does it mean it was appealing to
[56:41] her flesh
[56:50] [Applause]
[56:54] [Music]
[56:56] that is the last of the flesh
[57:00] and also the second reason was because
[57:02] it was pleasant to the eyes
[57:08] hey you know her eyes felt like am i so
[57:11] good oh if i can
[57:12] get that singing and finish if i can i i
[57:15] i
[57:15] receive that thank you it will satisfy
[57:18] me
[57:19] for our eyes what was lasting after that
[57:24] that is of the eyes and then the tree
[57:28] was to be desired to make one wise
[57:31] normal treat
[57:37] these three
[57:53] [Music]

[58:50] know go in adultery
[58:53] that's the reason why people got
[58:54] fornication
[58:56] because the world makes you feel
[59:00] separate if you do not do what they are
[59:03] doing

[1:05:52] three times the devil came to jesus
[1:05:55] three times
[1:05:58] three times and each time
[1:06:01] he tempted him with something
[1:06:05] the first time he tempted him with the
[1:06:07] last of the flesh
[1:06:10] the bread of life and then the last of
[1:06:11] the eyes
[1:06:15] now we see

[1:06:44] city
[1:06:57] he took him to the place of the
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:12] you may
[1:07:25] he suddenly also doubts
[1:07:42] [Music]
[1:07:52] in his mind
[1:08:08] in the mind of jesus
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:12] and he told him let us go so jesus
[1:08:16] was tempted yes i said jesus was tempted
[1:08:22] and he went on
[1:08:36] in
[1:08:46] the devil tried to make jesus without
[1:08:48] who he was
[1:08:57] [Music]
[1:09:04] because
[1:09:18] if you
[1:09:28] [Music]
[1:09:31] [Applause]
[1:09:33] yes i am are you a son of god my sister
[1:09:37] yes you are but does that never believe
[1:09:40] it
[1:09:43] but here i am to remind you as
[1:10:14] if the true church of god shall know who
[1:10:15] she is and what she stands for she will
[1:10:17] be an invisible army
[1:10:27] amen and jesus yes right at the pinnacle
[1:10:32] of the temple and the devil said to him
[1:10:35] if thou be the son of god
[1:10:39] cast myself down where was the devil
[1:10:43] standing are you
[1:10:44] in his mind whatever by the way but now
[1:10:47] if julia i'm a son of god i can't hold
[1:10:50] that aside
[1:10:50] and i test it so that can try to throw
[1:10:52] myself down oh sorry
[1:10:54] i love it in your life
[1:11:10] when the devil comes to him standing
[1:11:12] with jesus he quotes a scripture
[1:11:16] the devil knows who you are my children
[1:11:19] but the only doubt
[1:11:20] i actually was having so when it comes
[1:11:23] to you
[1:11:24] he knows how to approach
[1:11:40] that you will give a charge of angels
[1:11:42] concerning me
[1:11:46] so if i'm a son of god but now we're not
[1:11:47] going to talk about the angels are here
[1:11:50] their hands they shall bear me upon
[1:12:05] this scripture was exciting the mind of
[1:12:08] jesus
[1:12:09] christ is the way he said the truth
[1:12:13] he said it true if i'm a child of god
[1:12:15] come on i got to wonder does that
[1:12:17] work over me i am predestinated
[1:12:20] even if i
[1:12:29] he said it is after all even in the
[1:12:30] message the prophet said that it is not
[1:12:32] you who is holding yourself
[1:12:33] is his love that is holding
[1:12:49] and he sent me in this in this message
[1:12:53] and now
[1:12:53] i'm one of his own individuals
[1:13:00] he brought me out of the marriage
[1:13:10] [Music]
[1:13:15] so even if i i go this one time
[1:13:22] [Applause]
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:14:01] and jesus said unto him yesterday it is
[1:14:03] written again
[1:14:04] shall we create thou shalt not take the
[1:14:07] lord thy
[1:14:08] god take him come again thou
[1:14:11] shalt not tell the lord thy god
[1:14:15] and i tell you my sister my brother
[1:14:19] might want to do with you like how we
[1:14:21] did with jesus
[1:14:25] on a pinnacle
[1:14:40] oh
[1:15:00] [Music]
[1:15:02] no we should not own this world in its
[1:15:05] presence in full conditioning is going
[1:15:10] to be
[1:15:10] hours after the kingdoms of men are
[1:15:13] destroyed
[1:15:17] when the kingdoms of the world become
[1:15:18] the kingdom of our god
[1:15:22] and
[1:15:33] will become the kingdom of our god
[1:15:50] do not allow the devil give you this
[1:15:53] world around in his spiritual condition
[1:15:57] he may give you everything but he will
[1:16:00] ruin your entire life
[1:16:03] and jesus knew this whole world is his
[1:16:07] name but not in the present condition
[1:16:11] he therefore rejected the offer
[1:16:14] remember the devil wanted jesus
[1:16:18] only
[1:16:32] he will give you everything
[1:16:35] the pride of life but he wants to
[1:16:38] capture yourself
[1:16:41] as for me i say no i refuse
[1:16:45] do i have someone who will join me

[1:31:56] we've was tempted by the serpent to
[1:32:00] disobey god
[1:32:01] and eat the forbidden fruit of the tree
[1:32:04] of knowledge of good and evil

[1:34:44] have girlfriend boyfriend
[1:34:46] only a few months to marriage
[1:34:54] but you find younger people in the
[1:34:56] church
[1:34:58] preparing themselves
[1:35:26] desire
[1:35:40] know the
[1:35:50] which you see and then you desire to own
[1:35:53] open systems
[1:35:57] [Music]
[1:36:08] somehow perceived that the fruit would
[1:36:11] make her

[1:37:16] would make her like a god
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:44] do you know where you will be in two
[1:37:46] years
[1:37:48] [Music]
[1:37:58] i can be bigger than i am
[1:38:35] [Applause]

[1:38:52] station and offers the illusion
[1:38:54] of god like of god-like qualities
[1:39:00] [Music]
[1:39:05] in arrogance and worldly wisdom
[1:39:10] acquaintances

[1:39:39] [Music]
[1:39:41] not all of them maybe some maybe want to
[1:39:44] serve humanity
[1:39:46] but very few of course and even then
[1:39:49] even them soon they are corrupted
[1:39:53] that's why the prophet tells us politics
[1:39:55] is of the devil
[1:39:58] why because it seeks to lift you from
[1:40:01] your station and offers you
[1:40:02] an illusion of god-like qualities oh and
[1:40:05] our arrogance and worldly
[1:40:20] and i found
[1:40:26] [Applause]
[1:40:33] so this one
[1:40:45] was driving a big car a huge gap
[1:41:02] and he continued to go

[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:24] even if god ever blesses you with a lot
[1:42:26] of money
[1:43:06] if a snake or something would come this
[1:43:08] way
[1:43:48] the pride of life is anything that will
[1:43:50] make you feel you are boosting yourself
[1:43:52] and
[1:43:53] in arrogance and worldly wisdom
[1:43:57] [Music]
[1:44:04] not content to live in a perfect world
[1:44:07] under
[1:44:07] his perfect grace and chaos
[1:44:12] [Music]
[1:44:15] the devil tempts us to the last of the
[1:44:16] flesh
[1:44:26] [Music]
[1:44:32] someone eats and eats but they don't
[1:44:34] even want to work
[1:44:36] [Music]
[1:44:39] excessive alcohol consumption
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:44] and drugs
[1:45:04] [Music]
[1:45:28] drunkenness
[1:45:33] [Music]
[1:45:37] i'm reminding you this because this is
[1:45:38] the concluding a part of this
[1:45:42] series
[1:46:35] [Music]
[1:46:38] our
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:50] the very same that resulted in suddenly
[1:47:03] did you hear that if you see the
[1:47:06] preachers and the prophet
[1:47:07] the preachers of our generation
[1:47:10] many of them have desired to be god
[1:47:14] many of them one day there is one here
[1:47:15] in kampala who was even being worshipped

[1:47:44] phd pastor
[1:47:48] apostle

[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:30] was the biggest title that you could
[1:48:32] ever give him
[1:48:37] and sometimes when you call pastor
[1:48:38] brother he may not even answer
[1:48:42] he feels the believer in him
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:58] because these are the three things
[1:49:01] that overcome all the tempt the young

[1:49:48] you talk to me like that
[1:49:51] or you're getting angry oh

[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:21] let me preach this please
[1:50:55] [Music]
[1:51:02] oh let it never enter the message
[1:51:17] his wife
[1:51:33] jesus christ is the head of us
[1:51:38] hallelujah you know the the men
[1:51:42] we are very good at reminding our wives
[1:51:44] we are the head
[1:51:45] dragons
[1:51:59] i just have to drive you everywhere
[1:52:28] you this is the same reason why there
[1:52:31] are
[1:52:32] many desires there are many stripes in
[1:52:35] in churches
[1:52:36] [Music]
[1:52:41] in churches
[1:52:56] why
[1:53:09] what is the cause
[1:53:10] [Music]
[1:53:24] because
[1:53:29] [Music]
[1:53:39] it is everywhere the whole thing is
[1:53:42] rotten
[1:53:43] oh god children with the holy ghost
[1:53:48] so that you may make us ready for your
[1:53:50] coming
[1:53:58] [Music]
[1:54:06] see it's an instrument of death
[1:54:09] shi no chap why is it
[1:54:13] to exalt yourself in direct
[1:54:16] contradiction to jesus's statements
[1:54:20] he
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:55:02] the pride of life stands in our way
[1:55:09] whenever we try to stop the law
[1:55:12] and i'll finish with this quote
[1:55:15] from the message how the engine came to
[1:55:18] me and his commission
[1:55:22] of work brother please give it to me on
[1:55:25] the screen so that the people can follow
[1:55:26] me
[1:55:30] about
[1:55:32] you see saturn uses a man his head
[1:55:38] he chose that in the garden of eden
[1:55:43] to take a man's head
[1:55:47] to take a man is thinking
[1:55:50] the devil does not use your heart he
[1:55:53] uses your head
[1:55:58] and he has brought that down even to the
[1:56:00] church
[1:56:01] [Music]
[1:56:05] see the devil takes a man
[1:56:11] so he can use his eyes
[1:56:14] and if he will notice even the man isn't
[1:56:16] genuinely
[1:56:17] if the man isn't generally born again
[1:56:19] spiritual
[1:56:24] he will he will take what he can
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:52] because man wants to do something bigger
[1:56:56] he wants to make a big name for himself
[1:57:01] this thing is even coming in a message
[1:57:06] some people wanting to be bishops over
[1:57:08] the others
[1:57:10] [Music]
[1:57:16] [Music]
[1:57:18] i always hold one thing do things tight
[1:57:21] put it
[1:57:22] into the ability
[1:57:36] support the goals
[1:57:41] that's what the message tells us but
[1:57:44] the bible and the message
[1:57:48] in the church book i didn't prepare that
[1:57:50] quote here but
[1:57:52] the prophet insists not be a gambler but
[1:57:55] every man
[1:57:56] must be led by the holy ghost
[1:58:00] even the preachers even the
[1:58:04] people the pastors control the church
[1:58:07] by the world and the holy ghost
[1:58:12] [Music]
[1:58:15] not by their own ideas in the same
[1:58:28] [Applause]
[1:58:31] where god leads you you are free to move
[1:58:36] you're free to go but i want you to see
[1:58:38] this
[1:58:39] even the denominations they started
[1:58:42] small
[1:58:44] when becoming big and big and full
[1:58:50] [Applause]
[1:58:59] to even see this man of god
[1:59:03] you need to build your money
[1:59:06] you need to make an appointment
[1:59:10] [Music]
[1:59:13] until the man of god
[1:59:17] but i thank god that this message
[1:59:20] can never be a denomination
[1:59:24] okay let's read on here he wants to be
[1:59:27] religious
[1:59:52] [Music]
[1:59:57] what good does it do
[2:00:00] but he thinks he's achieving something
[2:00:03] because he's adding more
[2:00:04] now i never had to come
[2:00:07] and then he says i believe it was some
[2:00:09] years ago in 1944
[2:00:11] that the baptist had a slogan out a
[2:00:13] million more in
[2:00:14] 44. iran
[2:00:31] [Music]
[2:00:36] if they wasn't genuine born again
[2:00:37] disciples of christ they were just
[2:00:38] baptist by names
[2:00:46] look at the other denominations
[2:00:50] there was material the pentecostals
[2:00:53] all the other denominations they are the
[2:00:55] same
[2:00:56] they are trying to achieve something
[2:01:00] they want to do something great
[2:01:03] because it is his eyes he is looking at
[2:01:10] he's looking at what his eyes are saying
[2:01:14] he thinks with his eyes and many times
[2:01:17] he doesn't understand that
[2:01:18] that's the thing that he ought to not do
[2:01:22] [Music]
[2:01:26] but the devil takes the man his eye he
[2:01:28] shows him something pretty
[2:01:29] he opens his eyes to look at it and he's
[2:01:31] got that into the church
[2:01:42] [Music]
[2:01:48] and this message i was reading is from
[2:01:50] the unity of one god in one church
[2:01:56] and here's what i wanted to say
[2:02:00] in many churches today
[2:02:15] but we thank god for this message
[2:02:19] it's not about how many people we are
[2:02:22] now it's about how many souls
[2:02:26] are ready
[2:02:44] in this message of god
[2:02:48] it will be the same way our purpose is
[2:02:51] for us to find the last one
[2:02:54] but what do we have in the generation
[2:02:57] the pride of life oh
[2:03:06] [Music]
[2:03:09] our drive is to find the last source
[2:03:24] must have that burden to find that last
[2:03:26] shot
[2:03:30] and i finished with this quote as i
[2:03:32] promised how the angel came to me and
[2:03:33] his commission that's a very
[2:03:34] short quote he says just like a preacher
[2:03:38] a good faceful preacher
[2:04:06] try to make some big prestige or a big
[2:04:09] name for some church
[2:04:13] or a big name for himself
[2:04:17] friends we are not preaching this
[2:04:19] message
[2:04:20] because we are seeking a big name
[2:04:36] but why is it this way never actually
[2:04:38] it's the pride of life taking over
[2:04:43] and then he says i would rather have two
[2:04:45] or three nice meetings
[2:04:46] and praise on someone somewhere else and
[2:04:49] be humble
[2:04:50] again
[2:05:03] for money
[2:05:18] request for all nations i think it's
[2:05:20] christ for all nations
[2:05:23] she was money from brothers
[2:05:28] and others
[2:05:33] but he says i would rather preach a
[2:05:35] small meeting
[2:05:37] and be humble and straight down
[2:05:40] and you know what i mean yes sir
[2:05:44] always keep your place
[2:06:09] [Applause]
[2:06:42] out
[2:07:10] until
[2:07:23] i am blessed already
[2:07:27] indeed they are blessed already and
[2:07:30] their blessing is remaining
[2:07:31] here as for me
[2:07:35] and all those on their way to heaven we
[2:07:38] still need more blessings
[2:07:40] we still need to be blessed to be able
[2:07:43] to make it for heaven someday
[2:07:46] and we know we will make it amen
[2:07:49] amen i know i will make it you will make
[2:07:52] it my brother you will make it my sister
[2:07:55] as long as you stay in your flesh where
[2:07:58] god can find it
[2:07:59] where you can overcome the pride of life
[2:08:03] where you can say no nothing between two
[2:08:06] workers
