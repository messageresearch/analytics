[Music] are you happy to be in the house of the lord god is good god is good all the time and you say that you're not god is good i would love to say many things but just to save our time we uh would love to directly pass through out the word of god scripture so you are with me yes we shall read from exodus chapter 12. verse 12 and 13 i read it in the name of jesus christ i for i will pass through the lands of egypt this night and will smite all the first born in the lands of egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of egypt i will execute judgment i am the lord and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when i smite the lands of egypt hallelujah exodus chapter 12 verse 12 and 13. [Music] [Music] i want to to say something about how i came here and also i have bring greetings from all across ethiopia from the bible church church yeah greetings from pastor mogus greetings from my wife and all other brothers and sisters who are ministering now in addis ababa so you receive the greetings or not hallelujah well i want to testify also when i come to this message god has been using sister yodit it was maybe before five or six years ago she has come to that internet cafe to do her works and i was the one who has been doing the jobs of the internet because that internet cafe is my best uh i had a question which is a biblical question and she was just simply showed me uh a scripture or maybe i can say it was from the table or up or from the message hub she showed me a quotes which directly answers my question [Music] [Music] there are some brothers there what do i have if you come and join us any day you are able to cop i believe even if you have many questions by biblical questions those brothers will help you and based on that little information i have come to visit that church and we met with brother talema i can't say that he's my spiritual father today i will testify julia that pastor talema has almost impacted my life and has converted into another dimension you see this message has the power what you need to know about ethiopia many preachers many ministers from the message [Music] have been tried uganda what i'm preaching it will die together with these others it doesn't mean that teaching uh is not i didn't say that teaching is bad we have different professions [Music] yes we have to do our best is another dimension so i am thankful for for good neighbors has given me this chance and to come across from myself here in my beloved pastor talema's fellowship it is a big deal for me i know this place it doesn't uh you are limited in this place today i prophesy you shall amen we receive it hallelujah amen i proclaim because every word that comes out from the message believers that is just what happened on our prophet's life ministry he has been able to create by his mouth on the web out yeah you cannot get into and it comes through hallelujah amen may god give you that grace give you that faith [Music] you found that the prophet so when we start about defining from defining what the token means a sign of a paid price for example if you want to go uh by airplane they because they they cost you the same amount of money so when you give them that amount of money they will give you the same amount of uh money uh tickets tickets or an accounting uh we say it is receipt italy if you don't go with that invoice or receipt or ticket to the airplane they will not serve you even if you paid if you don't have that ticket so when we see from exodus chapter as we have read the scripture if you want to show me in this exodus the time was the beginnings of exodus which means god bringing israel all out of egypt but for uh israelis or for the children of abraham for them to reach on that promised land forest zenith to come out from their darkness they have been in bondage they have lost their hopes for many years as if someone like that who doesn't have good [Music] they have lost everything the yoke on their shoulder was too much but one day when god decides to uh bring them out from that bondage he sent them a prophet we know the prophet moses through prophet moses god has arranged and able to bring them out but while there they were in that situations of bondage you see what just happened to us goes to these two nations the nations of israel and the nations of egypt they were under the same authority you know the place where the silent has been gathered together yes so god wants us to execute judgment on the peoples of egypt and the gods of egypt even all the beasts of egypt he decided to execute judgment but before that judgment so he just instructed them to uh to prepare a lamb to kill that lamb and to put or to apply the bloods of that lamp on the door hallelujah that was the requirement because when the days ended or the angels of days comes to smite every firstborn if that end this angel does not see or look that blood he will just kill the first bird of even the animals even the pupils that was the token for them what is the token for us today we are under the bondage of this world but before god executes his judgment on this world this message [Music] this message is a token for each and every one of us it is just like a blood that we need to apply on each and every one of us and the blood shall do you for a token upon the houses where you are and when i see the blood i will pass over you. [Music] when i see the blood i will pass over your but those people who doesn't have this message if they don't have that revelation of the judgment shall not you hallelujah amen the bride of jesus christ christian is the place where jesus christ is living you hallelujah amen there are many churches there are many number of denominations if they don't apply in their life this message these people reject this message of this blood hallelujah amen they have the bible bible and they know that the bible allows baptism but the way they baptize people is another man made a that's why this message has come to restore us back to the original truth knowing what the knowing that uh the bible or the scripture allow us to baptize it doesn't help us these are the most important issues when the bible uh told us to baptize those who are able to repent so this is why we need to have the token [Music] so the same way this message is talking will help us not to be judged not to be uh not to be one of the one of uh those people or those denominations that this plague will come and destroy them today [Music] god is going which can be tomorrow there is hallelujah amen so the token was the thing that made the difference between egypt and israel [Applause] all god created and those who call themselves church or some kind of denomination all kinds of organizations hallelujah that bride oh my god has been calling out yay okay from days to life not only from uganda uganda that pride has come even from ethiopia today that pride has come from across america she is everywhere that is what makes it different from other churches or denominations not being controlled by any head office jesus christ hallelujah he is our leader jesus christ is the one who makes us a bride of himself yes hallelujah amen let me tell you the truth today even you no way you didn't even choose or uh yourself to be a bride of jesus christ it is hallelujah amen you have been someone who received jesus christ as personal savior going from one church to another time has come for you to recognize who you are you have now come to the revelation that who you are hallelujah amen this message is our that makes us the bride of jesus christ who is that bride back to the original this message there is several of them that if you judge it by the baptist church then the rest of them is and jesus is so then it comes back to the bible again he will judge the word by the bible jesus christ the penalty of doing it yes adding order taken from it's the penalty of it your name out of the book of life just stay who gave us this message even if god uses only man another man but the caller [Applause] [Music] we don't care if that prophet comes from ethiopia we don't care whether that prophet comes from china china we don't care that prophet comes uh from maybe i needed to be far hope but what we care about is what is that message what is it all about is it all about the bible he is not going to uh god is not going to judge the whole earth by this 1200 messages or sermons by william romero catholic so god is going to judge the whole artist and the word by the bible the messenger told us to baptize in the name of our lord jesus christ by calling upon the name of our lord jesus no one has been baptized by literally calling the father in the holy ghost father is just a tithe if you want to give me one billion check though unless you write my name instead of writing my name on that check if you called or if you write my my father name and said like uh if you write my father name is niku so if you write on that check by saying this no gamba for the son of negocia [Applause] angel gabriel has uh has told for uh mary maria maria he shall be called jesus hallelujah amen god himself manifested in flesh his name [Applause] whatever the prophet had said in [Music] god is going to judge the world by the anyone not all about the prophets hallelujah amen it's all about the message that man has bring for us [Applause] [Applause] of the first links of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect unto a bear and to his offering but until cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very rose and his countenance failed hallelujah say [Music] you see in this scenario what just happened was that there were two brothers called abba and kane [Music] the seed that comes out from adam and single about adam which is abel he office spirit is from god himself so he knows how to please his god and get your son away because when you are a seed of god you don't need to be told how to please god in this scenario abel and kane have been in accounting they are about to give offerings god himself but what makes the difference between their offering is the revelation you see he brings us as an offering a bloody uh a shedding blood from a lamp [Music] he brings all the best fruits that can be found in eden he was about the beauties all those who seems like beautiful something that seems like attractive so he thought he would be accepted by the lord he was pleased by the offerings of ebay when we see abel i'm sure he was you know there is so much blood around him that thing that seems like i'm pleasant for in the eyes of the mask is going to accept it by the [Music] that happened without shedding the blood [Music] of sin because seen by [Music] it that how a blood has a relationship with the first scene that's why god has already ordained for a man to be saved [Music] god ordained or god has been instructed specifically for the children of israel for them to be saved they need to apply [Music] that's why god has obligated to put himself a flesh he could have come as an angel yes he has the potential [Music] uh saying you see the ultimate price that has been paid for the elected ones is not just a million dollars amen amen that is also the only paid price for us to be saved we are so happy to have this message we shall not have any uh coffee or uh any uh anything with these uh denominations hallelujah amen because there is something that is repeating for us we have received the token we have received the blood we have received a message are you happy to be found in the message are you happy to be elected as a bride of jesus christ if you can uh we uh rise up and we shall praise our lord jesus christ there is a song uh called the moonlight of susan it's all about the blood of jesus christ hallelujah i will invite pastor here may god bless you until we meet another day [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] because they received and then [Music] i i know brother asked us to sing another song but there is this song that just talks about what he was preaching about him now we might not have sang it before but it's a very good song amen i mean i'd like you to come back again on on friday we will be having a night service we still have our brother the lord willing we shall squeeze him again friday night all men are saying we should do that amen so please come on friday night the lord spoke to [Music] and told him what to say to the children of slay [Music] oh oh [Music] life that we could be safe sing with me [Music] [Music] the sweet holy
