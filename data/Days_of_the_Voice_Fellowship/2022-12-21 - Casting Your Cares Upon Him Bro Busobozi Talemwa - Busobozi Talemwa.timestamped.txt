[0:00] yes I have a note here there's a lot of
[0:02] cares
[0:05] and so uh the spirit of the Lord led me
[0:09] to speak on this today
[0:12] casting your cares upon Him
[0:18] welcome back sisters
[0:26] amen Amina
[0:29] um
[0:30] casting your cares upon Him
[0:37] a friend in the time
[0:48] I will not belong as usual on Wednesday
[0:53] but I've been so much burdened
[0:56] to speak on this subject
[1:01] and I'm going to begin with a quote
[1:03] which I sent one of us and it was at a
[1:06] time that was uh a bit difficult for
[1:09] them
[1:23] but tonight I'd like us to talk about
[1:27] casting our cares upon the Lord
[1:32] why you
[1:33] Traders
[1:34] all of us here have cares for nobody
[1:38] wants at one point or the other in our
[1:41] life
[1:41] [Music]
[1:43] all of us have problems
[1:46] we go through things
[1:48] but here the prophet says in the message
[1:52] the mighty conqueror
[1:57] under pressure is what he is
[2:03] when he is under pressure
[2:07] have you ever been under pressure raise
[2:09] up your hand can you go
[2:11] now
[2:13] we can see you now smiling
[2:16] we can see you speaking with your
[2:18] friends
[2:19] we can see you laughing but that's not
[2:23] really you now yes
[2:25] the real you or your yeah when you are
[2:29] under pressure
[2:30] is when you are going through a tough
[2:32] time
[2:33] is when things are not going as you
[2:36] expected to go
[2:38] is when you don't have any money in your
[2:41] pocket
[2:42] when you you you have undergone a
[2:46] certain difficult situation
[2:48] [Music]
[2:49] is when you are going through problems
[2:52] is when you are down in the valley
[2:55] that is when we know who really you are
[3:01] a man is under pressure when a man we
[3:06] know a man when he is under pressure
[3:10] his real true characteristics
[3:21] [Music]
[3:54] to see whether there is any flaws in
[3:57] them
[3:59] I remember when we used to be in school
[4:03] especially high school and also the
[4:07] elementary
[4:09] primary you know you people would be
[4:12] there some of them they don't want to
[4:25] [Music]
[4:36] those who behaved as if they knew
[4:38] everything better than everybody else
[4:40] [Music]
[4:48] and you know before the government
[4:51] intervened to say that we shouldn't be
[4:53] children government
[4:56] I remember that we had a teacher his
[4:58] name was Mr walakira
[5:02] to come after the exams have been given
[5:07] and the results are out
[5:10] so he would come with a big Road in the
[5:12] class
[5:13] [Music]
[5:15] Hallelujah and I think brother we
[5:18] understand you need someone needs to
[5:20] help him listen to to make it a very
[5:22] good sound okay so and he would come
[5:24] with this road
[5:26] and then he would say
[5:29] anyone who is below below 60.
[5:37] you're facing it rough today
[5:40] I'm going to give you 10 of them
[5:44] and he would even tell you a day before
[5:48] [Music]
[5:50] I tell you I'm marking your exams
[5:55] and I'm coming back soon
[5:59] I'm bringing your results
[6:02] anyone who is below
[6:06] and not none of you have even from the
[6:09] what I've marked so far
[6:11] none of you is even above 40.
[6:15] anyone who is below
[6:22] and so
[6:23] pressures would begin to go up
[6:27] precious will begin to go up
[6:30] everybody was worried because we did not
[6:33] actually know
[6:36] how many you scored
[6:39] but those of you who knew that I tried
[6:42] my best
[6:44] you know they were a bit calm
[6:47] and those of us who trusted in God
[6:51] said anyway that they will come and they
[6:54] will go
[6:56] so we will not get worried
[6:59] praise the name of the Lord I'm sure
[7:01] that most of you went through that
[7:04] but you see in life
[7:09] because when you grow then you begin to
[7:12] see life differently
[7:15] you don't see life anymore as a child
[7:19] but you see life now as an adult
[7:22] and of course you come from being a
[7:25] younger adult to being an adult
[7:30] you take different pressures in life
[7:34] and then when you get married you get
[7:36] different pressures
[7:39] and then you know when you get jobs or
[7:42] you get different pressures
[7:46] I have to wake up very early in the
[7:49] morning
[7:50] oh I have to find food for my family
[7:57] so now our life really human life is
[8:01] full of a lot of pressure
[8:04] but here what
[8:07] tonight
[8:08] what I'd like to talk about
[8:11] how should a child of God behave under
[8:15] pressure
[8:18] when you find yourself when your back is
[8:21] against the wall
[8:25] you know when you find that you have no
[8:27] hope
[8:29] what are you going to do teach again to
[8:32] cause a child of God
[8:33] praise the name of the Lord during times
[8:37] of distress
[8:39] times
[8:47] when you have wants and needs
[8:51] you don't see anyhow you're going to
[8:54] meet them
[8:56] you need money and you clearly do not
[8:58] know how you're going to get it wait
[9:00] again
[9:02] and maybe your business is no longer
[9:05] working well
[9:07] maybe you've lost a job
[9:12] you know or maybe your parents can no
[9:15] longer take care of you
[9:19] know maybe some people going to
[9:21] loneliness
[9:24] you know there is nothing as bad as
[9:26] loneliness
[9:28] because if you are lonely
[9:31] it can easily get into depression
[9:37] depression and when you go into
[9:38] depression
[9:40] you feel disillusions
[9:47] you feel confused in your heart
[9:51] and you know others get into situations
[9:54] of heartbreak
[9:56] when you had confidence in somebody or
[9:59] something and then you were just let
[10:01] down
[10:03] you know hopelessness
[10:05] there is a lot of situations we can talk
[10:08] about
[10:22] during those hard times in your life
[10:26] and I hope I'm communicating to each of
[10:28] us tonight
[10:31] how do you behave
[10:33] when your back is against the walls
[10:39] when you can't think no more for a
[10:42] solution
[10:44] when somebody has disappointed you
[10:48] when you are in trouble
[10:53] when you feel your heart is ripped in
[10:56] pieces in many ways
[11:00] those are sad times
[11:03] those are hard times
[11:05] and I tell you people often do a lot of
[11:08] things
[11:15] you see
[11:16] you see it in Uganda we have a word
[11:26] you need to find
[11:29] campus
[11:34] but you are confused foreign
[11:56] right all of us here for normal you have
[11:58] been there before
[12:00] praise the name of the Lord people what
[12:03] did you do
[12:05] when you were in such times
[12:09] all of you can speak what you did but
[12:12] your mind
[12:13] mostly people cry
[12:21] what is wrong with you
[12:29] what if I can express what I'm feeling
[12:33] but I can't express
[12:38] when someone asks you what is wrong
[12:47] because we are going through a tough
[12:48] times
[12:58] as if someone has put them on a steroids
[13:04] how does they get angry you know you
[13:07] just talk to them
[13:10] they just sit back at you
[13:13] then you know I think he's distressed
[13:19] right I mean others they disappear
[13:23] or they forsake their responsibility
[13:27] we will find a father because he has no
[13:29] money
[13:31] we have many of us in our generation
[13:34] they leave the family there
[13:37] they disappear interesting
[13:45] because of what they're they're going
[13:48] through
[13:49] in their life they disappear my father
[13:54] was one that did that
[13:56] a lot of things that this distressed and
[13:59] depressed him one word interview
[14:02] and he collected all of us in the home
[14:05] I am the fourth of five children
[14:09] and he said wherever I've taken you in
[14:12] school
[14:12] [Music]
[14:15] that's the best I can do
[14:18] [Music]
[14:19] now all of you when now you need to fend
[14:23] for yourselves
[14:24] and he disappointed us he left us with
[14:29] our mother nature

[14:37] our home when I was 13 years old
