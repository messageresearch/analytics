don't we check our Bibles this morning I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ yeah the house of the Lord this morning you have your Bibles we go to Genesis chapter 2. Genesis chapter 2. verses 15. yeah I'm happy to see my brother here the message was baptized on Sunday also the other brother who was baptized on son I think his name is he said you will not make it because he was given some responsibility at home I'll happen to see my sister over there as well God bless you amen I mean we read Genesis chapter 2 verse 15. and the Lord God took the man and put him in the into the Garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it um the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of their knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatst thereof Thou shalt surely die said [Music] and we read verse 21. a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of the of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead they Arrow [Music] which the Lord God had taken from the man made he a woman and brought her unto the man massage amen mean and Adam said this is now one of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called a woman because she was taken out of man a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh um and they were both naked the man and his wife and we are not ashamed um Amina katsabi a precious love in Jesus we're so grateful this morning to know that even as Adam was taken even as Eve was taken out of Adam we have also been taken out of you the man from such we are the female parts we are the church and we have come here this morning so that you can fashion us into your image that we will be pleasing to you even my sincere prayer this morning Lord foreign a woman of virtue part three um can you get a better word of virtue oh um no but we have already dealt with these two services so you know what we're talking about because I'm wrong that's the right word um all right and then but this morning I'm specifically speaking on a sacred trust which is how many here have asked the appetite of the word this morning amen I mean some I'm requesting that you put your undivided attention avoid movements as much as we can today is something that is given to someone when now the person who has received the trust is can be called a trustee Monica and the trustee does not necessarily benefit directly from the trust but listen that trust is given to him for the benefit of others and so we want to look at that this morning that God has given to us but before we talk about the sacred trust that God has given please let's look at at Adam the Bible says that the Lord God formed man in his own image and man was in the image and likeness of God he gave him Eden the Garden of Eden to dress and keep it and if you look at verse 16 of chapter 2 is and the Lord God formed the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat is but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that you eat thereof that shall surely die now this was a sacred trust The God Who had entrusted to Adam God had given his word to his son and which comes trusted him you see a good Trustee of that word but of this one which is the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil surely not eat of it now there are three categories of trees and this we can just look at it briefly there is the Tree of Life which was in the middle foreign why because he was eating from the Tree of Life and so you don't come on told us we could eat him and he told us we could drink because his brother was food and he said I am the life foreign [Music] foreign was cast down on Earth and and he be he became the devil now focused on praise the name of the Lord but before we see this scenario of knowledge was there um not to eat of [Music] don't tell us that God let the devil come on us why didn't you want Adam foreign and then on down verse 21. God causes a sleep to fall on him and he out of his ribs Hallelujah man and he met a woman [Music] and Adam's saying now this is one of my bones and Flesh of My Flesh you shall be called a woman because she was taken out of this but then what happened after that Genesis [Music] when the woman came out of the moon is a part of the man um he can now be able to access by using the woman and when the devil did that she beguiled the woman foreign and I did it praise the name of the Lord I'm keeping quiet for a moment because I wanted to imagine this is God himself trusting you if he trusts you I'm so happy sister John name it means he has confidence it means he has decided to treat you as a prostitution against us he believed you will keep the trust sayakuma always he believes in you God believed in Adam why why because Adam was born of his own flesh of his flesh the image of God himself but when the woman came out of Adam the woman had those virtues but she was not able to keep it yeah Adam um he says let the woman learn in Silence with all subjections but I serve another woman to teach [Music] authority over the man to be in silence and Adam was not deceived listen now but the woman being deceived was in the translation so the woman was deceived [Music] and because she was the one who was deceived she was in the transgression yeah in Genesis as you say the serpent beguard me um the scripture says so is the way of an adult she eats and wipes her mouth and says what exactly did Eve put up that verse from me so it's the way of and now that is ready what's adultery all of you know what I doubting I know where is the movement so the scripture says the woman who has committed adultery she says after she has done it after she eats eating here means the act that she has died and the Bible says here the serpent the woman says the sun happened and she received to sit now foreign [Music] possible foreign now who is that Eve the second is you yeah Hallelujah Amina the first Eve fell away you will not fall please in Genesis foreign and Jesus Christ yes this is the second act through him all that life foreign you are dead even before let me tell you the moment you are born you begin to die did you know the moment you are born you begin to die oh my body was like oh but God healed to be bad news but let me tell you this is the best house and it will keep on getting bad and bad and bad it is objectives [Music] foreign you are the second woman you will not fall let me let me prove it to you here the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed the prophet of God says God in his body Christ Christian where was God in Christchurch reconciling the word for himself the god of Heaven and Earth was actually in the body of Jesus Christ if you understand it Jesus Christ yes Christmas or the second person of the Trinity is a Doctrine from Hell Doctrine [Music] but the word is [Applause] hallelujah amen glory to God in his body see that's what the body of God yes tell someone Jesus was the body yes God in his body Christo and Christo in his body the bride God in his body Christo and Christ after Christ the right oh my goodie where was God in Christ why is Christ right now you are Christ in me the hope of my glory [Applause] hallelujah amen God made manifest in Christ in Christ man manifest in the church God manifested himself do you see why you cannot fall forever amen and as God took from the body of Adam he took the woman and she fell then God has taken from the body of Christ [Music] that is foreign but she is coming back with a pure and I doubt there is the word of God being manifested I hope every man that hears this step and every woman will understand she is the second Eve did someone understand that we ought to be shouting because we know they cannot watch no I ought to be starting you know Hallelujah she is the second Eve community the woman a woman I say she is the second is but she is not breaking no yes and she's not spoiling her score I am not going to spoil my scars with four doctrines of Trinity that are not in the Bible you know praying for the day through the day I'm not going to spoil my scars regardless of what anybody says regardless of what anybody says [Music] I will not fall away from this message there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus Christ one time Hallelujah that's why I can't understand this message so much and talk about their Pastors in their mouths more than even Christ if you have been called out of the denomination the purpose of this message there is no condemnation that are in Jesus Christ foreign it's our privilege it is the sacred trust foreign foreign foreign we have modern houses [Applause] you're cutting this out or you know yourself to suit your own tests that but but to preach the full word the whole gospel that's what we are given to do it's a gift of God to me we are not going to compromise but when we know I'm passing something some great heritage that belongs to us because our church said they don't believe in this today that's not for us today it is Miracles used to be in the past those tongues you know these gifts for those ones yeah buddy Miracles giving every one of our promises to others I say it is mine it belongs to me they are our promises it is our Our Heritage we claim it we shouldn't bypass it because if we do foreign [Music] foreign but how can you say you believe it but you can't even say Amen in the church you have to act like you believe it is amen so I don't feel Faith yet just act like you'd believe it is foreign and then I began working that's what you feel but you believe the word I have medicine for you with the trousers um even if you don't feel like it act like it go away saying that joke don't move that's what we must do to take a look at what God is looking forward hallelujah amen I remember when we're coming down and they were told to go and circle I think it was seven times what do you think they were thinking could you tell us [Music] these people they are in a very big world and for us our work is to just suck foreign but yeah shouting itself was Victory and sometimes [Music] um foreign Hallelujah [Laughter] [Music] they shouted [Music] a space of time amen hallelujah amen God is what happens [Applause] speak amen I cannot wait for that nature and he says here let's go about just a few minutes and find those men who kept going to start with trust me that was his word that's what we inheritance foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] okay let me say this is the other three men they had three Roots which were covered by all the spirits of Egypt in person it is he had one stick one road if you have understood they had the trinity Musa that Moses we have one of the road who came with one road special power when Monsters the men were speaking with the King Allah the spirits of the Dead they are going to fight for us you went there it is finished we have seen them it is finished but they had the air because so they did people I will stand before you what am I going to do yeah they started laughing laughs I don't know whether we have anybody who has ever gone to a witches they also dropped his rod when he dropped to the road humble yourself America we can't be quiet because we have a message let me tell you we have determination we will preach it on radius know what we are talking about um we have young ladies foreign I'm getting into my 10th yeah and I'm just starting hallelujah amen let them give us one month let them give us one year let them give us five years [Applause] and by the end of swallowing it became a road again what do you no do you know what I'm talking about oh this happens [Music] in the hand of this world is at your masses foreign you are the one holding the wrath of God it's the truth of God hallelujah amen we have this sacred virtue of a sacred trust woman that we must keep praise the Lord amen praise the Lord and before I concluded I'm going to look at it in the physical as well but this is also meant to talk about the spiritualism speaks of the three sacred virtues a woman has a group and in a message Christ is the mission of God revealed Hallelujah but Isaac can you come here moment but brother can you give me that this is a woman is then trusted with certain characters that she must not Define not a man right okay there is not a creature on us like a woman there is no female dog has he's not female of any kind they worry you guys entrusted with a character that a woman is that she must be precious special um a woman was not even in the beginning of creation because God knew that she would fall all other females could not commit adultery she's the only one that could and can't commitment like the original that would be that would have been discomplemented to God it's great wisdom was made a byproduct of a man because she was cast over that side [Music] it's also been given a sacred charge for Redemption God has given a woman church and God wanted to begin Redemption and he spoke to a woman [Applause] God needed a woman got to give to entrust I'm going to get to give a sacred chat I'm aware of redemption she's got characters [Music] praise the Lord foreign Maria blessed among women praise the Name of Love Maybe from here Brothers oh my precious wife you are blessed among the women one of the reasons why you're a blessed sister because God has given you this child listen there are three sacred virtues and the prophet says if she would murder them [Music] she is defiled for Lifetime no matter how much is Forgiven if she must be second she cannot be testified I will strike that in a little bit she can be forgiven for our defilement but she cannot be justified in this life always with her foreign is trying to make men pregnant but that is not how it is God never put it that way that's why the body of a man is different from the body of a woman the body of a woman is so precious because it was given to bring forth life foreign now here is where you may disagree he says many of you theologians that's what defile the whole human race [Music] descriptions we find that our body is depending grounds and therefore it's a sacred trust um [Music] you find many women are voting and today in the most developed countries they're saying that uh you know women can abort it is even almost up to nine months foreign foreign and let me tell you foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] you see their dances and boys foreign [Music] the pastor's wife Zuma she's dressed with all these skimpy clothes which is meant to make men go to hell oh we're going already guys [Music] what are we praising Cartoon Network I'm showing you Malaga the type of thing we are facing in our days now this is given to bring forth the life that God only himself concrete but God has to produce the life it has to come whole life has to come from God obviously come from God is perverted and that's what makes it sinful but life has to come from God he's the author of life I want to name three things here that she must not get away from um now I'm speaking keep the church in mind while I'm speaking this natural this to a natural woman said in seventh chapter of Romans foreign you see even that's something wrong she must confess that to her husband before he takes up and make it right now this kind of trust of virtue always are you a virgin are you virtuous if she says yes she better be right foreign [Music] foreign [Music] really yeah really but now yeah the problem is with the man well um to divorce a woman because and then afterwards I'll ask you tell me what happened no it is such a Bible very well lost their wives because of of adults that's not scripture only it is allowed if she committed fornication that's before marriage um all right let's skip a bit here no notice now people don't go for giving her Obama trusted to have by the Lord God gave her that virtue foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Applause] what kind of generation we are having more energy Metrolina no wonder our models are rotten and decayed and filthy festivals because it is put before the children it has to be the way it has to be that way for the last day now keep the church in mind she is did you know that even the government sister allows you to go and see a man that will start your body anyhow government um you know these women who work in this public places even those who don't when they go to a public place animal foreign sorrow get him foreign foreign good camera you are not naked then you're fine Hallelujah I mean if you want to really dress sweeping the ground if you want to cover yourself like Muslims foreign [Music] foreign and then sacred motherhood to honor her husband says the lowest and immoralist and most filthy thing um and the most precious Jewel I think Ginger Richardson that is to a man a real massage Japanese salvation Jacob is a good woman if I tell you my wife is sick and I didn't come to church doesn't blame me if I tell you I couldn't preach because I was there taking my wife to the hospital to deliver child you can't blame me my my first priority is to my God the Savior My Soul um that's the order but you find some pastors putting Ministry [Music] that's not right that is your truth that's why many bastards have broken marriages your salvation your your your relationship with God your second is not your children it is may God feel alive am I preaching to someone else is your blessing from the Lord man foreign [Applause] you already have a good day can you see a woman because she is on both extreme zombie many times it's because of a woman Batman praise the name of the Lord mean brother if you have a good woman God bless and I believe I'm blessed also hallelujah amen pray the name of the Lord amen hallelujah and listen to this last squat here from the message the faith that was once delivered to the Saints now you are my sister but Luke there is only one place in the world Universe why do you wage that he gives a man his credit that's God gives it to him the god of America is a woman and I want to say that God Of The World Is A Woman cartoon that's right the true future strip one of these little women off ER and set them down here on the beach somewhere with their bathing suits on cuanto Lucas and she will send more men to hell they put leg joints you got in the city they never know that is the reason he chose the woman yes that's the reason today when I'm talking about half the spiritual mindset [Music] that will take people to Hell than churches they reach into children in our generation bars are not taking more people to hold on charges Brussels prostitute places houses they are not tracking more people to hell every planet today I take more people to Hell than any other place they are naked but he was from the Bible says in the Book of Revelation chapter 3.7 and they don't know if they unless themselves by refusing the lordship of Christ by refusing the sacred Trust of the word compromise or whatever scripture foreign you can you can stay the way you answers and the boys that's the reason he chose the woman the devil because the woman is redeemed the woman is redeemed and she can be a sister and godly but brother what we need today is some more good old-fashioned [Music] amen amen may God give us more God sent God very fast amen that will raise the children right that the children are our sacred trust God has given them to you my sister to show you what people believe okay when they go think about marriage they don't even think about children I think about their happiness they don't even think about what type of what type of children will this woman race people just go to churches they don't even think twice and you know they have swag but in a Swagger oh yes this is the church to attack boys look at that type of women oh she's so

will help me raise my children okay she's beautiful on the outside praise the Lord if she's educated in my mind I'm looking for a virtuous this is all type between Christ and the church I have the sacred version this is the type of message that not all pastors are excited to preach about it but these are things that people also don't usually want to hear foreign [Music] no no is this really wrong no okay we'll remember him in Praise anybody here who needs prayer please at this time I'd like you to raise up your hands foreign brother just played for us Reach Out And Touch the Lord as he passes by maybe you're one of those after hearing the word today I want to be found faithful at the end of the day have been kept and call me all my sacred trusts a woman keeps us not for herself but

give you a little update here I know I have people here who are the given and we are not read [Music] Uganda brunette myself my wife brother hashems Peter umale of Ginger yeah and he surprised me yesterday when he sent us 255 pounds and they said it is a lot good who are you it increases what you're looking for is being but our God and as of today what we as the church has contributed including the PVP fans DV3 is 22 million billionaire minimum Billy 700.00 now that only includes about 7 million to all and a little extra of the other funds there's a political Million numbers which is meant for another project this is allowed to get you one so that you can accumulate quickly um Now 23 Millions in uh how many months um okay I do not have the whole in front of me but you can count when did we start contributing anybody remember all right was it October last year so you can now count the ones who are good in Matthew can quickly and tell us how many months about 10 months now I believe you would have been far more than this because but I think some people who started in fire they reduce the fire if God provided for you then why not now security so I believe it's the fire we need more fire better come on how many agreement I don't care how much you're giving you Sister Martin even if it's 200 Shillings from the tomatoes give something account using that uh code yeah yeah 100 shillings every day those people refuse to declare who they were yeah but your giving is recorded one on earth and in heaven I don't say you gave for a few days and you stopped it was 100 shillings and it came on the account so all of you can do it you don't need to send if you are sending money too small you don't need to send to me auto brother Joel but what is the center neighborhood send it directly and then kindly that me or brother Joe will know so we can check the returns yes we appreciate that make note of that number and also there was brother brother Caleb I don't know whether it's on now but usually streams is in a place where there is no charge us so so he was telling me thing number that he would also like to contribute months and I I don't know about that Joel if you sent him the details yes you can all have those details about the job please post it on there for you again just pick those details and be putting one using your mobile money 100 shillings every day even if a student can now never every time how many believe they can do that you see the hands so I believe you can do it because I'm sorry the business people you can do it our consonants it cannot bring down your business business amen by the end of the year something can happen I've been thinking of a lot of solutions but like I said I'm still waiting on God I do not want to make any random decisions I went to the bank they told me they can give me money they told me they cannot give us money as a church because we we have been only running the account for uh about six or seven months this whether we have a brother giving us alone or not or at the bank or not We are continuing to contribute until we have all the fans the only problem is if we take a loan to the bank our button will increase if we take a loan from an individual foreign you remain on the bank account who are you and the lotteries we will hit the target no matter how long it takes you only needs us to have the right visions and frankly speaking this place is becoming more uncomfortable especially on Sundays the other Sunday I noticed people who were in the tents and sometimes very uncomfortable we need to have a better place singers or really pray about this and not only pray but contribute and also those who follow our services online because I know we have many people who follow ourselves otherwise God bless you come over brother Edison I'm so happy to see you today organisms assistant pastor to Pastor Charles we are always privileged to have you with us Amen Let us give another clap of praise for that amen and that someone is well recorded anybody can go back and listen again it was a blessing to us I had it many times but when you preached it it stuck with me God bless you all come on you are all dismissed we will be here on Wednesday at five a community those who can't be here at least connect by way of the internet God bless you all
