[56:03] Steven uh

[56:23] Side
[56:26] but now they conquered Theo
[56:30] region when I first came to the

[56:36] Pastor sand
[56:37] Steven is one of the people that kept on
[56:40] preaching to
[56:43] me and he's a
[56:45] teacher uh he is not that much
[56:50] educated but he knows a lot of this
[56:53] message
[56:55] and uh I I usually feel in my heart is a
[56:59] walking dictionary of this
[57:02] [Music]
[57:04] message and yet he never went to school
[57:07] that
[57:07] much but watch what the spirit of God
[57:10] can
[57:11] do and uh he impacted my
[57:15] life God used him with others and they
[57:20] really minister to me and I am what I'm
[57:23] partly what I am because of like
[57:27] him and so uh I've been to his church
[57:30] and I preached there I think a few
[57:34] services and met some ministers in the
[57:38] region he uh he kind of works Associates
[57:42] with several pastors there more than 20
[57:45] I
[57:47] think and they most of all of them look

[1:11:43] P it is because this
[1:11:48] pit it is for the
[1:11:50] pastor he
[1:11:52] knows who to bring
[1:11:55] here and what he's going to give to the
[1:11:59] for he is the
[1:12:01] pastor he
[1:12:05] spoken
[1:12:08] small He Has Lifted Me So
[1:12:11] High I'm very
[1:12:14] down I never went to
[1:12:17] school I don't have
[1:12:20] education I don't know anything
[1:12:26] there is nothing that I glory
[1:12:30] in Praise
[1:12:34] Jesus even the tri where I was
[1:12:38] born they never even knew
[1:12:44] God even me I grew when I was UN
[1:12:48] righteous but by
[1:12:51] Grace he called me
[1:12:55] he called me as I was he called you the
[1:12:58] way you
[1:13:00] were you didn't do
[1:13:03] anything you cannot glory in
[1:13:06] anything for all of us here whether you
[1:13:10] went to school or you never went to
[1:13:12] school whether you know or you don't
[1:13:14] know
[1:13:17] anything when you
[1:13:19] die whether you have money whether you
[1:13:22] have a car
[1:13:24] whether you have a house whether you
[1:13:26] have a
[1:13:27] wife you don't go with
[1:13:32] anything you cannot glory in such
[1:13:36] things you can't glory in
[1:13:39] these there is nothing we can glory in
[1:13:42] but there is only one thing as Paul
[1:13:47] said he said that if I have to glory in
[1:13:51] this flesh
[1:13:54] no one is better than
[1:13:56] me I'm a
[1:14:00] Jew for the Jew is the nation which God
[1:14:05] Called to be called a
[1:14:07] Jew you are such a very wonderful person
[1:14:10] special
[1:14:13] person it was so great that God chose
[1:14:16] the
[1:14:17] Jews to become his
[1:14:21] nation and he said that I'm of a tri
[1:14:24] of
[1:14:27] Benjamin you know there are two tribes
[1:14:30] in
[1:14:31] Israel those are the most powerful
[1:14:33] tribes The Tribe of Benjamin and the
[1:14:36] tribe of
[1:14:37] [Music]
[1:14:40] Judah he would have glorified himself in
[1:14:44] being of the tribe
[1:14:45] of and he said in the
[1:14:48] law I am
[1:14:51] a he went to school
[1:14:54] in the
[1:14:57] col in the
[1:15:00] of he was
[1:15:02] trained he was
[1:15:05] Tau he was supposed to be a priest or a
[1:15:10] pope
[1:15:12] Bishop he was already in school for
[1:15:17] that but when he met
[1:15:20] Christ all those things became of no
[1:15:24] [Applause]
[1:15:26] gain for when he he he realized that
[1:15:29] knowing
[1:15:30] Christ is the most important thing it is
[1:15:34] not the
[1:15:36] education it's not
[1:15:39] the it is not the
[1:15:41] clothes the
[1:15:44] robes you know in the religious real
[1:15:48] they have Rob every rob it has its Glory
[1:15:53] every Rob has it own when one
[1:15:58] person one person can put on like five
[1:16:01] Rob or
[1:16:02] six and they put on a
[1:16:05] heart so when you look at them you
[1:16:09] really see there in
[1:16:11] heaven so Paul was higher than
[1:16:15] that praise our
[1:16:18] Lord but all that they never helped him
[1:16:24] praise our
[1:16:25] Lord that when I say
[1:16:28] this I want us to look at what is far
[1:16:35] beyond people have got
[1:16:41] honors people are really
[1:16:48] high they
[1:16:51] white when the whole earth look looks at
[1:16:53] them they
[1:16:54] tremble but when sickness
[1:16:59] comes
[1:17:01] sickness when sickness or the devil
[1:17:04] come when death
[1:17:06] comes yeah I think I think is death when
[1:17:10] death
[1:17:12] comes n of them stands before
[1:17:16] it
[1:17:22] died very many popes have
[1:17:27] died praise our Lord Buddha
[1:17:31] died
[1:17:33] died of them overcame
[1:17:36] death but there is one man it is Jesus
[1:17:43] Christ you don't have anything to Glory
[1:17:47] about I don't have anything to
[1:17:50] Glory even when I put on a glittering
[1:17:55] suit if I put on a one million wor
[1:18:02] suit you drive the most expensive
[1:18:06] car but they will never bury you with
[1:18:10] it and it will not stop you from
[1:18:14] dying but we have one man who is an
[1:18:18] overcomer the one who never went to
[1:18:21] school
[1:18:24] amen he did not have any
[1:18:29] qualification praise our
[1:18:32] Lord but when he met
[1:18:35] death he overcame
[1:18:39] death when he met the grave he overcame
[1:18:43] the
[1:18:44] grave when he reached in the grave in
[1:18:47] hell he overcame hell am now that
[1:18:51] man the one we should glory
[1:18:55] in if you don't have that man you are
[1:19:03] [Music]
[1:19:05] nothing that is why I was feeling so
[1:19:08] small before God and it is good each one
[1:19:14] of us to see yourself like
[1:19:17] that
[1:19:20] because he loves them that love him him
[1:19:25] mm- he loves who he loves
[1:19:32] amen he forgives them he wants to
[1:19:35] forgive you can't command
[1:19:40] him you cannot advise
[1:19:46] him he is infinite uh-uh dictator he's a
[1:19:51] dictator
[1:19:56] amen
[1:19:59] hallu even the educated one are
[1:20:05] collected praise our
[1:20:08] Lord now that
[1:20:11] man no one is like him what he
[1:20:17] decides nobody can stop
[1:20:20] it so for you to be here he has decided
[1:20:25] you to come he has decided that you come
[1:20:29] here the one he didn't want to be here
[1:20:32] he's not
[1:20:33] here for you are here for a
[1:20:37] purpose and he's the one who brought
[1:20:42] you and you don't have anything to say
[1:20:45] about it for you have already come
[1:20:50] [Applause]
[1:20:51] here our
[1:20:54] Lord when the pastor told
[1:20:58] me as you're coming
[1:21:02] this I want you to come and visit
[1:21:06] us and said is it the way God has shown
[1:21:09] it to
[1:21:13] you he said that is it you have to
[1:21:17] come if he is the Lord he wants me to
[1:21:21] come he will make me
[1:21:27] come I don't want to
[1:21:30] do what I
[1:21:32] want I want to do what he
[1:21:38] wants because even my coming the other
[1:21:40] time I didn't bring
[1:21:45] myself and I'm not the one who brought
[1:21:47] this
[1:21:49] brother when we finish the
[1:21:51] service the
[1:21:57] brother God has met me I've seen

[1:22:06] visitor but that was his first
[1:22:09] time even me it was my first time to see
[1:22:13] but when you see the
[1:22:14] tesy you really see God had the
[1:22:17] purpose where he came from and he came
[1:22:20] in that
[1:22:21] service an evening service
[1:22:26] amen you see how God does things
[1:22:30] everything it happens as a purpose there
[1:22:34] is
[1:22:37] nothing nobody will go this side or the
[1:22:40] other
[1:22:41] side if God wants you to come in a
[1:22:44] certain
[1:22:45] place I T in church of Uganda for three
[1:22:48] years I loved God I was seeking for God
[1:22:54] I never went there to seek for a job I
[1:22:57] didn't go there to seek for
[1:22:59] Hors I went to seek
[1:23:02] God and when I reach
[1:23:05] there God wanted me to go
[1:23:11] there because God has ways through he
[1:23:15] takes through his children that they may
[1:23:17] know
[1:23:18] everything praise the
[1:23:20] Lord I spent those three
[1:23:24] years and God put me on another
[1:23:27] level and he helped me meet the
[1:23:32] Pentecost the way they came the way they
[1:23:36] came to
[1:23:37] me I I realized that the things which I
[1:23:41] knew when they were weed in the
[1:23:47] Bible I was found holding only feathers
[1:23:54] because the first question they asked me
[1:23:57] it was
[1:24:01] baptism they told me they baptized you
[1:24:04] they baptized you in the
[1:24:06] forehead where did you get that
[1:24:10] froment
[1:24:12] and when he had G to
[1:24:16] preach I looked for a scripture which
[1:24:19] says
[1:24:21] sprinkling I thought I had my
[1:24:24] Reverend for he's the one who sent
[1:24:27] me when I asked the
[1:24:30] reverend in the Bible is there
[1:24:36] imion what he told
[1:24:39] me that I told him there are
[1:24:42] people there are people who were asking
[1:24:44] me where did we get the
[1:24:47] sprinkling the re told
[1:24:49] me do what we told you
[1:24:57] show me a scripture when I meet them
[1:25:00] I'll give them
[1:25:01] proof he said I've told you one
[1:25:05] thing as we told
[1:25:08] you so do what you told if you want them
[1:25:13] go where they
[1:25:17] are but here we don't do what those men
[1:25:21] are telling you
[1:25:24] you
[1:25:25] see what would I have done
[1:25:29] sincerely there is no written
[1:25:32] evidence there is no evidence of
[1:25:36] sprinkling there was no
[1:25:39] evidence nobody has ever done it the God
[1:25:42] is
[1:25:44] Bible there are not two Bibles it is
[1:25:47] only one Bible God is one we are working
[1:25:52] for God all of
[1:25:54] us what is not in God's program now as a
[1:25:58] preacher why do you preach what is not
[1:26:00] in God's
[1:26:03] program now I found myself that the
[1:26:07] gospel I was
[1:26:08] preaching it was the Gospel of the
[1:26:11] church it was the Gospel of the Church
[1:26:13] of
[1:26:14] Uganda but it was not The Gospel
[1:26:17] according to the
[1:26:20] Bible now all you you know you see
[1:26:24] because whatever is written whatever we
[1:26:27] preach whatever we preach must come from
[1:26:29] the
[1:26:30] Bible praise our
[1:26:34] Lord if we are preaching the
[1:26:36] gospel we are not the begin the one who
[1:26:39] started the
[1:26:41] gospel the gospel was started by our
[1:26:47] Lord and it was held by the first
[1:26:51] believers
[1:26:52] and it was confirmed with Miracles and
[1:26:55] wonders and they took the gospel all
[1:26:58] over the world so Jesus said go around
[1:27:01] the
[1:27:02] world now when the gospel reached
[1:27:06] here as when it comes when it is
[1:27:09] changed how can we take what is
[1:27:12] changed we have to take the
[1:27:15] original and they made a mistake and
[1:27:19] they gave us a
[1:27:21] Bible
[1:27:23] when you go in
[1:27:25] confirmation they say buy a
[1:27:29] Bible that is why I say God bless those
[1:27:31] people for telling us to buy Bible they
[1:27:34] sh us
[1:27:36] Delight when you move in
[1:27:39] darkness it will they shown us the light
[1:27:42] if you move in darkness it is up to
[1:27:44] you for you have the testimony in your
[1:27:49] hands you have the kingdom in your hands
[1:27:54] may the Lord bless
[1:27:57] you I was just laying a
[1:28:00] foundation I was in Pentecostal for six
[1:28:03] years in those six
[1:28:07] years they lifted
[1:28:10] me and I became an
[1:28:13] overseer Overseer in P you are a
[1:28:18] bishop because you are an
[1:28:21] overseer you have churches which you
[1:28:26] oversee I was I was having three
[1:28:30] districts under me I was a bishop of
[1:28:32] three
[1:28:35] districts we ate
[1:28:40] goat we had go owners we enjoyed
[1:28:45] owners praise our
[1:28:47] Lord but when we met this
[1:28:51] message God took away all those
[1:28:56] honors praise our
[1:28:58] Lord and we remain
[1:29:01] with one honor of being a pastor when
[1:29:04] you're a pastor feel good for in the
[1:29:09] Bible pastors are there in the
[1:29:12] Bible if you're a
[1:29:14] teacher feel good because in the Bible
[1:29:18] teachers are there in the
[1:29:20] Bible if you are a preacher
[1:29:22] if
[1:29:23] EV because evangelist in the
[1:29:30] Bible if you an
[1:29:32] AP if an apost feel good for in the
[1:29:37] Bible Apostles are
[1:29:39] there your your honor is your glory it
[1:29:43] is there in the
[1:29:45] Bible
[1:29:47] but if you're a prophet still good as a
[1:29:51] prophet because you are there in the
[1:29:53] Bible but other glories and
[1:29:57] honors you were given to them by the
[1:30:01] devil because in the Bible they on
[1:30:06] titles there are titles which are
[1:30:11] put in the Bible there are not such
[1:30:14] titles
[1:30:18] amen Bishop in the Bible there is no
[1:30:22] Bishop in the Bible there is no
[1:30:27] father in the Bible there is
[1:30:31] no in the Bible there is no Arch
[1:30:35] Bishop in the
[1:30:37] Bible there is
[1:30:45] no in the Bible there is no Zone
[1:30:50] leer
[1:30:52] in the Bible there is no
[1:30:56] Pope so if they are not in the Bible
[1:30:59] they are not in the book of
[1:31:04] life now how can I be outside the Book
[1:31:07] of
[1:31:08] Life what am I doing
[1:31:11] there the Bible says in Revelation that
[1:31:14] books were open and the Book of Life was
[1:31:18] open and whoever who was not written was
[1:31:21] thrown into to the Lake of
[1:31:24] Fire now that
[1:31:26] title if God never gave it to
[1:31:38] you others are called
[1:31:46] Lords Lord if you don't call them Lord
[1:31:50] they don't feel good
[1:31:53] because he went to school to get that
[1:31:56] title but Jesus said you should never be
[1:32:03] called in the Bible it is
[1:32:06] there and it is Jesus who said that but
[1:32:10] then somebody takes it they have become
[1:32:16] Lord others are
[1:32:20] called
[1:32:22] [Laughter]
[1:32:31] brother because
[1:32:35] is the most
[1:32:37] Lord the most
[1:32:41] Lord that is that that title is for
[1:32:45] Satan is's the one who gives such he
[1:32:48] gives them to whoever he
[1:32:50] wants but but me I left all
[1:32:56] that brother Bram say if you love me
[1:33:01] call me brother
[1:33:04] Bram
[1:33:06] brother we are
[1:33:09] brothers we are brothers Jesus even
[1:33:12] Jesus is our brother say I call you my
[1:33:16] brothers are you a brother of Jesus amen
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:22] if I am a brother of Jesus I feel better
[1:33:26] because we are one
[1:33:27] blood even here we are
[1:33:31] brothers praise our
[1:33:33] Lord we have Elders we have young ones
[1:33:37] we have siblings but we are all
[1:33:41] Brethren do you like that to be
[1:33:48] brothers when you have your elder
[1:33:50] brother your elder
[1:33:52] brother praise the
[1:33:54] Lord and the younger brother they all
[1:33:58] remain
[1:33:59] Brothers but there is a
[1:34:01] father the father of all of us that is
[1:34:05] the one who loved us and called
[1:34:08] us he wants us to be one in
[1:34:12] unity praise our Lord and for that
[1:34:17] cause I have not yet started my
[1:34:20] preaching
[1:34:24] I you know Pastor have a lot of
[1:34:26] words I don't know how I'm going to
[1:34:28] reduce these
[1:34:30] words the words are so
[1:34:32] many when you spend many years you see a
[1:34:36] lot of
[1:34:38] things when you go through many places
[1:34:41] you meet a lot of
[1:34:43] things now through the p through the
[1:34:46] Church of
[1:34:47] Uganda through the message there's a lot
[1:34:51] that have met and they want they now
[1:34:56] that so God teaches us through the
[1:34:59] lifestyle we go
[1:35:01] through Praise
[1:35:05] Jesus I know that every stage you
[1:35:08] reach it has a level a level of
[1:35:11] challenge for
[1:35:12] that when I left church of
[1:35:15] Uganda I I I accepted to be
[1:35:19] abused they abused me
[1:35:22] they said that it is the devil who took

[2:01:37] Jesus answered and said this voice came
[2:01:40] not because of me but for your sakes now
[2:01:43] is the Judgment of this world now shall
[2:01:45] the prince of the of this world be cast
[2:01:48] out and and I if I be lifted up from the
[2:01:51] earth will I draw all men unto
[2:02:06] me may the Lord bless his
[2:02:09] word all of you may be
[2:02:13] seated these words are so
[2:02:16] important the man we have been talking
[2:02:18] about
[2:02:20] now he has spoken for
[2:02:22] himself the main issue why the work he
[2:02:26] was sent for to do it was
[2:02:30] finished for the work we had brought it
[2:02:33] was to declare and two people God the
[2:02:38] word for the
[2:02:40] word it had been separated from the
[2:02:45] people people had separated themselves
[2:02:47] from God
[2:02:49] praise our
[2:02:51] Lord what we are going to learn
[2:03:04] today
[2:03:06] God reuniting with his people to work
[2:03:11] with
[2:03:14] men praise the
[2:03:17] Lord this
[2:03:22] Unity
[2:03:24] yes God had the
[2:03:38] unity God bringing back his own into
[2:03:43] Unity with
[2:03:47] him
[2:03:49] praise the
[2:03:51] Lord
[2:03:54] God once God had Unity with men but
[2:03:59] men broke that
[2:04:02] Unity but to
[2:04:07] restore rest
[2:04:13] that to restore that Unity God had to
[2:04:17] find a way
[2:04:21] God had to find a way of bringing back
[2:04:24] man into that Unity
[2:04:27] again it was
[2:04:30] important for God to first
[2:04:34] come to come
[2:04:37] down because
[2:04:39] man had fell from his glory and he fell
[2:04:44] down falling
[2:04:46] means something was up and then it fell
[2:04:51] down something cannot be down and then
[2:04:54] you say it has
[2:04:56] fallen something must fall from
[2:04:58] somewhere and then it falls
[2:05:01] down we know that
[2:05:04] God is above all
[2:05:08] situations even us when he created us he
[2:05:13] created us in
[2:05:15] him we are
[2:05:17] above are
[2:05:19] above our lives are
[2:05:21] above more than all
[2:05:24] things praise our Lord
[2:05:28] now we were in the mind of God even
[2:05:32] before the foundations of The World
[2:05:36] God we were with
[2:05:39] God and we were in
[2:05:41] him praise our Lord and we are in his
[2:05:46] word now time came
[2:05:50] and God spoke
[2:05:52] us
[2:05:56] and a word is a thought
[2:06:00] manifested
[2:06:01] amen when a word is
[2:06:04] spoken it shows what is in the
[2:06:08] mind because what is in your mind is
[2:06:11] what you speak
[2:06:13] amen now
[2:06:15] God he said let us create man
[2:06:19] in our own image and in our own
[2:06:22] likeness praise the Lord now
[2:06:26] man is a part of God's
[2:06:33] thought if man is a part of God when he
[2:06:36] was
[2:06:37] spoken and he became a part of his
[2:06:43] word praise the
[2:06:47] Lord uh

[2:06:52] wife and she
[2:06:54] laughed I told

[2:09:35] for that which is in his
[2:09:38] mind praise the
[2:09:41] Lord when the person finds that he will
[2:09:45] give it a
[2:09:47] try with
[2:09:50] word is my
[2:09:52] thought if is this thought the one I'm

[2:09:58] Madame do you believe do you
[2:10:02] accept to be my
[2:10:06] wife testing the
[2:10:11] thought when the woman says

[2:10:16] now it is like
[2:10:19] [Music]
[2:10:24] now become a
[2:10:25] word the word brought the
[2:10:33] wife's wife was first in the
[2:10:36] thought now she became the word he spoke
[2:10:40] it now when the woman accepts it when
[2:10:43] the woman accepts it the woman becomes
[2:10:46] T's word
[2:10:49] when she believes that word that word
[2:10:51] lifts her and brings her into's
[2:11:00] family Hallelujah

[2:11:10] birth it gives
[2:11:15] children praise the Lord
[2:11:18] even
[2:11:20] God he wants
[2:11:23] family he wanted a
[2:11:26] family be
[2:11:28] with but the family was in his
[2:11:33] mind he wanted to speak it that it will
[2:11:36] be manifested and then he sits with it
[2:11:40] and then he feeds with
[2:11:43] it that it may look like him praise the
[2:11:48] Lord
[2:11:49] Lord I've used the example of my
[2:11:54] son now the children you
[2:11:57] see before you married you had
[2:12:02] them but you didn't have
[2:12:05] fellowship with
[2:12:09] them but to to the desire to have the
[2:12:13] children in the physical real they had
[2:12:16] to get a wife
[2:12:20] to
[2:12:21] see to in order to see his children
[2:12:25] praise the Lord that is why
[2:12:29] God he took
[2:12:32] confidence in
[2:12:34] Adam as the image of God as the likeness
[2:12:38] of God he knew that Adam will give birth
[2:12:43] children that will look like him because
[2:12:47] Adam was looking like God and even Adam
[2:12:52] he had to give birth children who look
[2:12:58] like praise the Lord now saw
[2:13:03] man he said this man it is not good
[2:13:08] for for these
[2:13:11] years for the years as God have
[2:13:15] spent God spent those years alone
[2:13:26] he was living by himself but he had a
[2:13:28] lot of attributes he was not
[2:13:32] seeing so God
[2:13:35] wanted the things which were in his plan
[2:13:38] to be
[2:13:40] manifested and even his children to be
[2:13:43] manifested now in his children that were
[2:13:47] in his thoughts
[2:13:49] to see
[2:13:50] them so he sent his word because the
[2:13:53] word is what gives us to God his
[2:14:01] children God
[2:14:03] is says that every seed must bring forth
[2:14:07] of its kind the dog gives birth to a dog
[2:14:11] a cow give to a
[2:14:13] cow after creating all things he gave
[2:14:17] them a Lo
[2:14:18] but every kind will produce of
[2:14:21] its in Genesis
[2:14:24] 1 that is God's La everything brings
[2:14:28] forth of his and even God he must give
[2:14:32] birth of his
[2:14:36] kind now let us create
[2:14:40] man Genesis
[2:14:44] 126 he was creating a man in God's image
[2:14:48] [Music]
[2:14:49] Genesis
[2:14:52] 2:7 he was manifesting the
[2:14:56] flesh he made the
[2:14:58] FLH
[2:15:01] but I'm lost
[2:15:04] Pastor I
[2:15:14] yourdon when God created man the word
[2:15:19] create it means to speak and then
[2:15:22] something happens speak and
[2:15:31] exist so God said let us create
[2:15:34] man God created man in His image and in
[2:15:39] his likeness now that man he was not
[2:15:45] created that man was not made but he was
[2:15:48] created
[2:15:51] amen The Man was
[2:15:59] created now God created a man and then
[2:16:02] he made another man for the one who was
[2:16:05] created uhuh made he made he made a man
[2:16:10] for the other one who was
[2:16:11] created
[2:16:13] amen have you got
[2:16:16] it Genesis 2
[2:16:19] that was the creation of the flesh
[2:16:23] genesis6 creation of the spiritual
[2:16:27] man now the man and the
[2:16:32] flesh they are not the
[2:16:37] same praise the
[2:16:39] Lord the man and
[2:16:42] this and the flesh are
[2:16:46] different
[2:16:49] man who was
[2:16:51] created and man who was
[2:16:55] molded they are different that's
[2:16:58] right you get
[2:17:01] it now the
[2:17:06] man a man is not
[2:17:12] made a woman and a man they make a body
[2:17:17] but they don't create the person that's
[2:17:22] right it is God who creates the
[2:17:27] person parents make the body
[2:17:31] mean that is why God says he doesn't see
[2:17:35] in the
[2:17:36] house built by
[2:17:41] men that is why
[2:17:43] man man was not worthy to be given back
[2:17:48] man was not supposed to be given birth
[2:17:50] from a union of a man and a
[2:17:53] woman you see
[2:18:00] that Adam was supposed to speak the
[2:18:04] word and then a child would be
[2:18:07] created that
[2:18:12] child would be created but not made yes
[2:18:19] that is why the
[2:18:21] devil he has no authority to
[2:18:24] create because he can't speak something
[2:18:27] into
[2:18:28] existence
[2:18:30] but he
[2:18:33] uses the instrumentality of
[2:18:36] God so he used the
[2:18:39] serpent to get a
[2:18:42] child through the
[2:18:46] woman so that he will also get a person
[2:18:50] they he works
[2:18:51] with praise the Lord but
[2:18:55] God when man
[2:18:59] fell God no longer sits in the
[2:19:03] man who was who was made by a man and a
[2:19:11] woman that is why God brought the second
[2:19:16] birth
[2:19:18] when somebody is not bornn
[2:19:20] again they will never inherit the
[2:19:22] kingdom of
[2:19:24] God because what is born of the flesh it
[2:19:27] is
[2:19:32] flesh the devil can use that in any way
[2:19:35] he want but whatever is born of God he
[2:19:38] does not
[2:19:41] sin have you seen the
[2:19:45] difference now our Glory
[2:19:48] Glory we glory in the
[2:19:51] flesh but the
[2:19:53] truth we should not glory in this
[2:19:57] flesh we supposed to glory in the in the
[2:20:03] New
[2:20:04] [Applause]
[2:20:06] Birth because Adam's
[2:20:09] Family which was supposed to be burned
[2:20:11] by the
[2:20:13] word he used the
[2:20:16] flesh
[2:20:18] and then he followed the law of the
[2:20:22] devil that the
[2:20:25] serpent had
[2:20:27] flesh
[2:20:31] amen now after the
[2:20:35] fall Eve fell from the
[2:20:39] word and then she remained
[2:20:43] can now the Flesh of The Serpent and of
[2:20:46] Eve
[2:20:48] you know when somebody moves out of the
[2:20:51] spirit what remains is to use the
[2:20:54] flesh the serpent told her God lied to
[2:20:59] you the day you will
[2:21:01] eat your eyes will open and you will be
[2:21:05] like God you will begin
[2:21:15] creating many people giving birth they
[2:21:18] think they are Gods because they give
[2:21:21] birth I am the one who created you I
[2:21:23] gave birth to you that is the
[2:21:29] devil because man cannot
[2:21:32] create it is only God who creates it is
[2:21:36] God who
[2:21:37] creates from
[2:21:40] today if somebody was not created by God
[2:21:44] they will never inherit the kingdom of
[2:21:46] God whatever is born of the flesh
[2:21:49] remains flesh and whatever is born of
[2:21:51] the spirit it is
[2:21:56] Spirit now if somebody does not have the
[2:21:58] spirit of God they have no difference
[2:22:02] with
[2:22:04] animals because what separates us it is
[2:22:08] God in
[2:22:09] us if God is not in you if God is not in
[2:22:13] me I can do whatever I want
[2:22:19] you see
[2:22:20] that now this
[2:22:23] message it brings
[2:22:28] back what brought
[2:22:31] Jesus because
[2:22:33] God when God saw Adam
[2:22:37] defeated Adam's
[2:22:39] Family
[2:22:41] fell it fell from the
[2:22:44] glory it fell from God's glory and fell
[2:22:47] down and the devil took it over and went
[2:22:50] with it now devil the same way the devil
[2:22:54] fell from
[2:22:56] heaven and he also made man to fall from
[2:22:59] God and man fell down now man and the
[2:23:03] devil they were on the same foot now he
[2:23:06] rules them what rules man is the
[2:23:10] devil because the devil fell first so
[2:23:14] and he made the man so he's going to
[2:23:17] rule the man he rules the man under the
[2:23:20] falling
[2:23:22] nature the one who
[2:23:26] fell the one who fell rules the one he
[2:23:30] made to
[2:23:31] fall you
[2:23:35] see now we are ruled by someone
[2:23:39] who when we are in this flesh and we
[2:23:42] obey the
[2:23:44] flesh we are under the rulership of the
[2:23:47] one who
[2:23:49] fell but we have a
[2:23:52] man God brought another man hallelujah
[2:23:57] [Music]
[2:23:59] amen Jesus brought a
[2:24:02] parable and he said that a mighty strong
[2:24:06] man when he ties
[2:24:08] somebody and he puts them
[2:24:12] down and another mightier person comes
[2:24:15] am amen
[2:24:19] this one was powerful he tied up this
[2:24:22] one and he made him sit
[2:24:25] down and now another more powerful
[2:24:28] person Comes Who is more powerful than
[2:24:31] the one who tied the other one and also
[2:24:34] get hold of him and put him
[2:24:38] down and he gets the one he
[2:24:42] deliv who is
[2:24:44] [Music]
[2:24:45] mighty
[2:24:50] now we and Satan who is more
[2:24:56] powerful have you got
[2:24:59] it if you understand
[2:25:01] it the
[2:25:04] devil was once powerful over me he was
[2:25:08] once powerful over you because he got
[2:25:11] old of you and he made you fall and he
[2:25:15] brought you from God
[2:25:17] and he tied you down under his
[2:25:20] prison but
[2:25:22] God he came with another
[2:25:25] man
[2:25:27] amen the most powerful man than the on
[2:25:31] who have tied
[2:25:33] you like you see
[2:25:36] Rebels rebels can come and capture
[2:25:39] someone as they ad mistreating you there
[2:25:42] the government sends the Army and the
[2:25:45] Army finds you tied up
[2:25:48] and then the Army will capture the they
[2:25:51] tie them up will they leave you
[2:25:55] tied
[2:25:57] you now the one who was bound will the
[2:26:02] oh now the rebel will be the one who
[2:26:04] will remain tied up
[2:26:07] yes you will stand why were you tying
[2:26:11] me they have got you now hallelujah
[2:26:15] amen
[2:26:18] you have to get the dev and do him like
[2:26:22] because we have a man Jesus Christ who
[2:26:25] overcame him and he put him down and he
[2:26:29] tied him and he tied him and he
[2:26:33] delivered you he took away the keys
[2:26:37] hallelujah
[2:26:41] amen whatever had put you in in his
[2:26:45] prison he he Jesus has the
[2:26:48] keys
[2:26:51] sir the devil had the keys and he
[2:26:55] was all God's children who would come he
[2:26:58] would lock them up he would lock them
[2:27:00] somewhere All God's Children he would
[2:27:04] lock be there David lock
[2:27:09] thereon think you have God be
[2:27:13] there hallelujah
[2:27:15] hallelujah and then he
[2:27:18] said Son of
[2:27:21] Man when he will be lifted from
[2:27:25] down he will bring
[2:27:28] all and bring them back to
[2:27:32] him praise the
[2:27:34] Lord he he came
[2:27:38] down he came down first from
[2:27:41] glory and became
[2:27:44] man he was born like a child
[2:27:47] he cried like a
[2:27:49] child he knew that the
[2:27:52] devil he entered and into two
[2:27:57] men the devil used all his
[2:28:03] means and he entered into the human race
[2:28:06] through the
[2:28:08] serpent but our Lord when he came in the
[2:28:12] world because he was
[2:28:15] God God used the word
[2:28:25] [Music]
[2:28:27] hallelujah
[2:28:31] amen used the word and the devil used
[2:28:35] the flesh he entered in flesh but God he
[2:28:39] used the spirit and entered
[2:28:42] into and was born Spirit he was not born
[2:28:46] in flesh
[2:28:51] the devil brought the sexual
[2:28:53] Union but our Lord his
[2:28:58] birth it was not from a sexual Union
[2:29:01] between a man and a woman because that
[2:29:05] it was the
[2:29:07] falling that is where we fell
[2:29:10] from the way which you would have
[2:29:13] taken that we would not be tempted we
[2:29:16] fell into the we came through
[2:29:19] [Music]
[2:29:22] Temptation the way we we part the
[2:29:25] falling nature from
[2:29:28] Adam all who are born by the
[2:29:31] woman they are born under the Fallen
[2:29:34] nature
[2:29:37] because we were not supposed to be born
[2:29:39] by
[2:29:40] women we are born by the
[2:29:45] word
[2:29:47] not bisexual
[2:29:49] Union when I say that there are some
[2:29:53] wise
[2:29:54] people who were by
[2:29:57] science and they
[2:30:01] thought is only the sexual Union which
[2:30:04] is
[2:30:04] there but let me show
[2:30:08] you from
[2:30:09] to that birth and
[2:30:12] existence birth and existence is not of
[2:30:14] one nature
[2:30:19] show me show me the parents of Adam the
[2:30:22] mother and the father of
[2:30:25] Adam was didam exist was he a man did he
[2:30:31] exist was was he existing from a father
[2:30:34] and a mother
[2:30:37] no if did he did she exist was she given
[2:30:42] birth to a man and a
[2:30:45] woman Eve was born by a
[2:30:49] man because God when he created man he
[2:30:54] created a man and
[2:30:58] woman so that the man will be the one to
[2:31:02] give birth because he's the one with the
[2:31:10] [Music]
[2:31:11] seed praise our Lord Brother Su brother
[2:31:15] SU
[2:31:27] men are very
[2:31:29] careful they are very very very
[2:31:31] caring praise the Lord
[2:31:36] now you're talking about how God
[2:31:45] came was born was not born by man and
[2:31:56] woman now what we
[2:31:59] saying the man had to give
[2:32:03] birth because he's the one with the
[2:32:06] seed God is the one to give birth
[2:32:10] because God is a
[2:32:12] seed a
[2:32:14] woman is a
[2:32:20] Garden a woman is the
[2:32:24] church but the seat is from the
[2:32:28] man
[2:32:33] now did not have where to his
[2:32:36] seed
[2:32:38] am himself he became a woman and he
[2:32:42] became a
[2:32:45] man yeah
[2:32:47] M that is
[2:32:50] right praise the Lord
[2:32:52] because God give him
[2:32:55] time to be with that
[2:32:58] woman the woman was in the
[2:33:03] man's wife
[2:33:05] was and that was his daughter and it was
[2:33:09] his
[2:33:11] wife praise the
[2:33:14] Lord now when the
[2:33:19] he had nowhere to give birth
[2:33:22] from so they operated
[2:33:25] him they
[2:33:27] operated
[2:33:29] amen when they operated
[2:33:32] Adam God brought the child out and
[2:33:36] brought the child to and
[2:33:41] now because first
[2:33:44] sleep when they going to
[2:33:49] you they give you
[2:33:51] chlorop and you sleep a deep
[2:33:54] sleep when you come
[2:33:57] back you come back knowing that I went
[2:33:59] to give
[2:34:02] birth you come back looking for the
[2:34:05] baby I went on that
[2:34:07] bed the reason why I was almost I was to
[2:34:11] give birth now I want my child this is
[2:34:15] my child
[2:34:16] now even
[2:34:18] Adam God took him to the bed and
[2:34:21] operated him and removed the wife and
[2:34:25] removed the
[2:34:26] baby when the baby came out he brought
[2:34:31] himam said nobody else this one is
[2:34:37] born of my B and his
[2:34:41] flesh from my
[2:34:43] flesh she will be called the woman
[2:34:46] because she was taken from
[2:34:49] [Applause]
[2:34:51] me now 's mother who is 's
[2:34:56] Mother and 's Father who is 's Father it
[2:35:01] is
[2:35:03] Adam you believe
[2:35:06] that hallelujah
[2:35:09] hallelujah that was very brand
[2:35:13] new God is very wise
[2:35:17] sence when in science when they
[2:35:22] operating the operating science started
[2:35:25] with
[2:35:26] God these men are just
[2:35:30] copying they copying
[2:35:41] what so she became a wife but before she
[2:35:44] became a wife she had to reach the state
[2:35:46] of the
[2:35:47] perfect to be a child and then grow
[2:35:51] up growing
[2:35:53] up to reach the St of giving birth to
[2:35:57] get a child and give
[2:35:59] birth you see
[2:36:05] that lived Like a Virgin
[2:36:10] girl waiting for what God
[2:36:14] say God said don't
[2:36:18] touch Adam did not even know what a
[2:36:20] woman is it was a
[2:36:27] mystery both of them had a mystery they
[2:36:30] didn't know
[2:36:34] Hallelujah God said give birth and
[2:36:37] replenish the
[2:36:39] Earth he spoke that when they were not
[2:36:42] in
[2:36:43] flesh he spoke to the spirit
[2:36:47] man so they were supposed to give birth
[2:36:49] in the spirit not in the
[2:36:52] flesh now to be the spiritual
[2:36:56] birth it is just a spoken
[2:37:01] word
[2:37:02] Mary gave birth to a child by the Holy
[2:37:09] Spirit the woman to give birth without a
[2:37:14] man
[2:37:16] there was no
[2:37:18] Union ever since the Earth ever it had
[2:37:21] never
[2:37:24] happened but God said that it will
[2:37:28] happen because when man
[2:37:30] fa God
[2:37:32] promised that the seed of a
[2:37:35] woman
[2:37:39] will will
[2:37:41] bruise the seed of a woman will
[2:37:44] bruise
[2:37:51] all these things I'm sneezing they
[2:37:54] came but we went past
[2:37:58] that those are Satan's lives we are more
[2:38:01] than
[2:38:02] conquerors praise our Lord
[2:38:06] now that is why
[2:38:11] Jesus is a very
[2:38:14] special that is why the birth of Jesus
[2:38:17] was so
[2:38:18] special because Jesus is
[2:38:22] spiritual he was born by the
[2:38:25] Spirit by the word which was
[2:38:27] spoken because
[2:38:29] man was spoken by the spirit and the
[2:38:35] word let us make
[2:38:37] man in our own
[2:38:40] image and in our own
[2:38:44] likeness is the
[2:38:46] word
[2:38:48] likeness it is the likeness of
[2:38:51] God in the
[2:38:53] beginning the spirit of God was Hing
[2:38:57] upon the
[2:38:59] waters when the whole earth was full of
[2:39:02] but when the spirit
[2:39:04] spoke
[2:39:06] amen the light came
[2:39:09] forth only the word cannot work without
[2:39:14] the spirit even the spirit cannot work
[2:39:18] alone without the
[2:39:22] word that is
[2:39:25] why
[2:39:31] man man must be born
[2:39:34] again to be given birth by the
[2:39:38] word to the nature of the word the
[2:39:43] Spirit come into that man of the
[2:39:48] word am
[2:39:52] amen are
[2:40:00] you let us go further I don't want to
[2:40:04] make you
[2:40:05] tired praise the Lord now
[2:40:09] man man is
[2:40:12] inded to come back to his or
[2:40:17] image you see
[2:40:20] that now when man
[2:40:23] fell the image and likeness of God it
[2:40:28] was it it was
[2:40:31] removed and we
[2:40:32] became in the image of the
[2:40:38] serpent this
[2:40:40] flesh it is not what looks like
[2:40:44] God
[2:40:46] this flesh is not what God
[2:40:50] created the other one was
[2:40:54] created and your was born from a man and
[2:40:58] a woman the other one was just
[2:41:00] created you see
[2:41:05] that now we want to go back into the
[2:41:09] Flesh of the third
[2:41:12] dimension this
[2:41:14] flesh
[2:41:21] [Music]
[2:41:22] that it is your original
[2:41:25] flesh but instead of coming within that
[2:41:28] flesh that devil when to Adam and they
[2:41:34] fell that flesh went back the
[2:41:39] the so we were born into the
[2:41:42] flesh not into the other spiritual Word
[2:41:47] Flesh
[2:41:48] the you get it now this flesh it is
[2:41:54] tempted but the other
[2:41:58] one it can't even do
[2:42:01] that now that
[2:42:03] flesh it is the original
[2:42:08] you if you were in the mind of
[2:42:12] God you were just get gotten
[2:42:16] copy and one copy remained here and then
[2:42:19] the original remained in heaven
[2:42:24] Hallelujah now what you see is a
[2:42:26] duplicate it is the duplicate which the
[2:42:29] devil
[2:42:30] uses but when the original comes it will
[2:42:34] no longer sin
[2:42:39] anymore praise the Lord that is why this
[2:42:42] flesh it is tempted because it was born
[2:42:46] in in in in in in
[2:42:49] last the Bible says in John chapter
[2:42:59] 1 the he said whoever is born of God
[2:43:03] does not
[2:43:07] sin he
[2:43:09] doesn't the one who is born of God it is
[2:43:13] the word you are the one the one who was
[2:43:17] with
[2:43:20] God Jesus prayed the prayer
[2:43:24] said
[2:43:26] father the children you gave to
[2:43:31] me they were
[2:43:34] yours and then you gave them to
[2:43:39] me and yours are
[2:43:42] mine and mine are yours
[2:43:46] praise the
[2:43:48] Lord I I've given them the
[2:43:54] word if you were God's child who was in
[2:43:58] eternity when you hear the
[2:44:01] word you hear
[2:44:03] yourself you hear your name say that is
[2:44:07] me that
[2:44:14] is
[2:44:15] now the other you there God creates them
[2:44:19] in the you
[2:44:21] here every word you
[2:44:24] hear it
[2:44:29] creates every word you hear it creates
[2:44:33] the other you there in you
[2:44:37] here in this body hallelujah amen
[2:44:43] hallelujah because you
[2:44:46] you are a
[2:44:47] word you were with God you in God's mind
[2:44:52] and you
[2:44:57] fell the one who was in The Go image of
[2:45:00] God went
[2:45:03] back now God made a person who looks
[2:45:06] exactly like you that is Jesus
[2:45:11] Christ
[2:45:14] you
[2:45:17] Jesus is
[2:45:20] you when you believe
[2:45:22] Jesus and he enters
[2:45:27] into you are the real Jesus who was
[2:45:30] here you can't
[2:45:33] backslide because you
[2:45:38] fa you fa but the you was not
[2:45:44] around but God got all of us hallelujah
[2:45:50] amen and he gave us a new man to come
[2:45:55] and give birth to us hallelujah
[2:45:58] [Applause]
[2:46:01] amen the one who were not born by the
[2:46:03] flesh and blood but born by
[2:46:07] [Applause]
[2:46:09] God and God he became
[2:46:14] man when he became man he becomes
[2:46:21] you because when Jesus comes in
[2:46:25] you that is the real
[2:46:28] image Jesus is the image of
[2:46:31] God that is
[2:46:33] invisible because when we
[2:46:37] fell we didn't know the image of
[2:46:40] God we look
[2:46:44] like
[2:46:48] nobody looks like
[2:46:53] God see Yow people black
[2:46:56] people is God black is God
[2:47:01] Brown is a white man or
[2:47:05] what praise the
[2:47:11] Lord God really so we are not looking
[2:47:13] like him
[2:47:15] everybody looks what they want I want to
[2:47:18] turn to your
[2:47:19] neighbor look at your neighbor and see
[2:47:21] whether they resemble
[2:47:23] you they don't
[2:47:26] resemble everybody resembles every
[2:47:29] sing which one of you resembles
[2:47:35] God praise the Lord but

[3:07:55] knew before they came into existence
[3:07:59] they the ones he chose the ones he

[3:08:20] authority to

[3:08:25] Lord hallelujah
[3:08:27] amen now what I want to
[3:08:31] say what shows that we
[3:08:34] fail I want to show you
[3:08:38] that
[3:08:39] everything which God
[3:08:42] created he created it
[3:08:47] perfect but when time
[3:08:50] came when man
[3:08:52] fell praise the
[3:08:57] Lord when man fell he became
[3:09:02] naked there was nothing God created
[3:09:05] which was
[3:09:07] naked look at the
[3:09:10] goats the goats have their clothes
[3:09:14] the God's cloth it is born with it it
[3:09:17] dies with
[3:09:18] it P
[3:09:20] Cuts they don't
[3:09:23] wash they don't
[3:09:27] wash it's clothes does not wear out all
[3:09:32] the time it looks good it doesn't have
[3:09:35] oil it doesn't have anything but God
[3:09:39] created it with that
[3:09:41] garment is see
[3:09:45] that the dog all of them they have their
[3:09:51] garments but people every
[3:09:55] Friday they want to go and buy
[3:09:59] clothes if I ask you how many clothes
[3:10:01] you have bought so far you don't even
[3:10:03] know
[3:10:05] them it means that you
[3:10:09] fail praise the Lord that is why
[3:10:29] every Saturday you will be buying new
[3:10:32] n but
[3:10:35] cows ever since it got its
[3:10:38] shoe even today the same shoe
[3:10:44] [Applause]
[3:10:47] gos everything it owns they don't
[3:10:50] wear because they are still in God's
[3:10:53] will they never
[3:10:57] fail that is why
[3:11:01] Jesus he came to clothe
[3:11:05] us because when man
[3:11:09] fell the devil told him you are now
[3:11:14] ashamed okay get some
[3:11:17] leaves put some
[3:11:20] leaves he covered himself
[3:11:22] with but as you know God is right when
[3:11:25] God came the leaves dried
[3:11:33] up why you
[3:11:36] running God I don't have clothes I'm
[3:11:40] naked what else from God that it was
[3:11:45] naked because the
[3:11:47] devil had undressed the woman when he
[3:11:51] undressed her even the woman undressed
[3:11:55] the
[3:11:58] husband they were naked
[3:12:01] now so what God had given them they were
[3:12:04] no longer seeing
[3:12:08] it the dog does not commit
[3:12:11] adultery gods don't commit
[3:12:16] adultery because it is human beings who
[3:12:18] commit adultery and
[3:12:20] fornication that is why
[3:12:26] goats goats cannot rap
[3:12:29] CS
[3:12:32] kids but people two
[3:12:36] years 20
[3:12:39] old get with five children
[3:12:43] they are more animals than real
[3:12:48] animals now what shows that
[3:12:58] many animals which are male they cannot
[3:13:02] meet
[3:13:05] together but human
[3:13:07] beings they want a law to allow him
[3:13:12] marry fellow
[3:13:15] man think
[3:13:19] about until When God says I
[3:13:23] regret I ever made
[3:13:28] man was that man still in the image of
[3:13:33] God a woman was made for one man but
[3:13:38] today a
[3:13:41] woman
[3:13:43] a woman can be married to like five to
[3:13:45] six
[3:13:47] men men can marry more than one woman
[3:13:50] and women get married more
[3:13:52] than praise the Lord but God he made one
[3:13:57] man and give them one
[3:14:01] woman praise the
[3:14:04] Lord now see the mistake all the
[3:14:07] mistakes we see they show the we as the
[3:14:11] church
[3:14:14] we want a
[3:14:16] generation that fears the
[3:14:19] Lord women that fear the lord our
[3:14:24] children who fear
[3:14:27] God praise the
[3:14:29] Lord
[3:14:32] invisible and when you go in the message

[3:14:37] Heaven bridegroom yes the Earth bride
[3:14:40] and Heaven bridegroom uhuh
[3:14:46] H the prophet talks about the major
[3:14:50] things which were given to a woman there
[3:14:52] are three major important things given
[3:14:54] to women praise the
[3:14:56] Lord number
[3:14:59] one a woman was not made like other
[3:15:03] animals she was
[3:15:05] created in her
[3:15:08] nature she has a
[3:15:11] door
[3:15:13] in the nature of women women have a
[3:15:21] door animals don't have virginity but
[3:15:23] human
[3:15:25] beings why did God do it that
[3:15:31] way she was given that to protect
[3:15:35] herself to keep that virtue of
[3:15:39] virginity praise the Lord secondly
[3:15:43] the the womb which gives
[3:15:48] birth she's supposed to keep

[3:16:09] to use it to bring forth children for
[3:16:11] the husband
[3:16:13] praise the
[3:16:17] Lord the third
[3:16:19] thing the the body of the
[3:16:24] woman there is a way God molded the
[3:16:26] woman's
[3:16:29] body all the things God put on a Woman
[3:16:34] They for only the
[3:16:37] husband not any other
[3:16:40] person amen
[3:16:43] the stomach the
[3:16:46] thighs every Beauty on a woman it is for
[3:16:49] her

[3:17:39] virginity a man who is not there
[3:17:43] husband God will not justify a woman who
[3:17:47] lost her
[3:18:06] virginity because that is so
[3:18:10] bad that is what the serpent
[3:18:16] did the woman is the one who brought
[3:18:21] polygamy because she was known by Two
[3:18:27] Men And even the first woman man was not
[3:18:30] the
[3:18:33] husband because God put that

[3:19:08] the parents to train your
[3:19:11] child
[3:19:12] never to

[3:19:21] bad if you were
[3:19:25] married and you didn't tell your husband
[3:19:28] the
[3:19:29] truth repent your husband that cause can
[3:19:34] make

[3:19:42] to be divorced by your
[3:19:44] husband whether it has been 10
[3:19:47] years or you have how many
[3:19:51] children you were in in a in a false
[3:19:58] marriage in a false relationship because
[3:20:01] you didn't tell your husband the
[3:20:04] truth but if you tell your husband and
[3:20:07] he forgives you it has no problem but if
[3:20:11] you lie to him
[3:20:14] praise the
[3:20:15] Lord on the day of
[3:20:18] judgment they will ask you
[3:20:21] that praise the
[3:20:23] Lord this is what I'm
[3:20:26] saying if made a
[3:20:29] mistake and a very bad
[3:20:31] mistake because
[3:20:35] blood every Union between with a virgin
[3:20:40] woman there is
[3:20:43] blood that blood it is the
[3:20:50] Covenant you become one
[3:20:54] blood your
[3:20:58] blood your blood will have
[3:21:01] joint will have joint will have
[3:21:06] joint God says what he has joined no man
[3:21:10] should put a s
[3:21:13] that is why that blood it is what joins
[3:21:17] you even as the blood the blood of Jesus
[3:21:21] it is what joins
[3:21:26] us that is a very crucial
[3:21:30] [Music]
[3:21:31] matter CHR Christ wants virgin
[3:21:35] women Christ is not going to marry a
[3:21:40] prostitute hey
[3:21:46] now our
[3:21:47] marriages is a a
[3:21:50] picture of Christ and the
[3:21:54] church today our marriage in
[3:21:59] religion religions
[3:22:03] married this woman Christ no today
[3:22:07] religion has married Christ's
[3:22:10] wife that is why the
[3:22:13] church the church is Christ's wife but
[3:22:19] today they have joined the church with
[3:22:22] with with
[3:22:26] priests they make you lie on the
[3:22:29] ppit and they put you there and they
[3:22:32] make you swear from
[3:22:35] there they you put on from
[3:22:40] today you are joined with the with the
[3:22:46] church what will Christ remain that is
[3:22:49] why they don't
[3:22:51] marry because their wife is the
[3:22:55] church their husband is the
[3:22:59] church they don't marry because their
[3:23:03] wife is the church is the
[3:23:06] church praise the
[3:23:09] Lord now what will Christ marry
[3:23:14] when we are joined with Christ we become
[3:23:17] his
[3:23:20] wife when we are joined with
[3:23:23] religion we become
[3:23:27] prostitutes we are
[3:23:30] in we are
[3:23:33] defiled because Jesus talked about the
[3:23:36] Virgin there are 10
[3:23:40] virgins
[3:23:42] why did he use that word of
[3:23:44] virgins because a
[3:23:47] Virgin It is a pure
[3:23:50] woman so when we are born of the world
[3:23:53] we become virgins
[3:23:58] again in the spiritual
[3:24:02] realm we are no longer children or wives
[3:24:05] of the
[3:24:07] prostitute of the harot har yes he
[3:24:14] I can't even see I've made you praise
[3:24:17] the Lord what I am
[3:24:21] meaning we need to put things back into
[3:24:24] their
[3:24:25] position because things went astray the
[3:24:30] devil made things to go
[3:24:33] astray he took things from their
[3:24:37] position that is why God he starts from
[3:24:41] family
[3:24:46] where no young
[3:24:50] man no man is allowed to marry a woman
[3:24:54] who is not a Believer right or
[3:24:59] likewise no girl is allowed to be
[3:25:02] married to a man who is not a
[3:25:05] Believer whether they have money whether
[3:25:08] they are
[3:25:10] rich
[3:25:12] it is impossible under no
[3:25:15] circum before God that is a
[3:25:19] sin because that is what brought in
[3:25:22] Noah's days the world
[3:25:25] to because God is
[3:25:28] children instead of marrying God's very
[3:25:31] children they left God's
[3:25:34] children and they made into
[3:25:36] marriage they joined kan's blood with
[3:25:39] s's children it made God
[3:25:43] angry and he said from
[3:25:46] forth I will no longer wrestle with
[3:25:50] men and then he took away his Spirit
[3:25:52] from them that is very
[3:25:59] bad you will first
[3:26:01] back and then you go in the world bring
[3:26:04] girl and bring her to
[3:26:06] church I tell you never do that
[3:26:10] brother may do
[3:26:12] it and God will never forgive
[3:26:16] you or you
[3:26:19] sister you see the man here are poor you
[3:26:23] want some rich
[3:26:25] man who is in their religion
[3:26:28] there say that one will will take care
[3:26:32] of I tell you you would have sold your
[3:26:38] life there is no any place that allows
[3:26:43] you you and there is no place anywhere
[3:26:47] where you allowed to join with kind
[3:26:51] seed the religions you see they are kind
[3:26:57] children when you marry or get married
[3:27:00] to them or when they marry
[3:27:03] you they want to make
[3:27:05] you they want to make you what they
[3:27:09] are amen
[3:27:13] amen Solomon
[3:27:17] died he died when he had
[3:27:20] back because of
[3:27:23] women every woman he would
[3:27:26] bring he would come with their Spirit
[3:27:29] evil
[3:27:32] spirit you
[3:27:37] knowel for Maring from the
[3:27:40] world

[3:27:48] beautiful he married B's
[3:27:52] daughter yes the father was a priest of
[3:28:03] B The Woman married was a priestess to
[3:28:08] in B's
[3:28:10] Temple you know what that woman did to
[3:28:13] Israel now God from that
[3:28:17] time from the times of Noah he got
[3:28:22] angry and he removed his Spirit when we
[3:28:25] do that we make God
[3:28:30] angry how can the light join up with
[3:28:37] Darkness what portion does a Believer
[3:28:40] has with an unbeliever
[3:28:44] men
[3:28:46] here we want a generation which fears
[3:28:51] God a generation that is going to meet
[3:28:58] Jesus hallelujah

[3:30:47] this that
[3:30:50] is there is a tribe in
[3:30:53] Uganda they
[3:30:56] say when you have one
[3:31:00] woman you may give birth to stupid
[3:31:02] children
[3:31:05] only in that
[3:31:08] Tri This Woman This Woman

[3:31:45] there are very many
[3:31:51] bastards and they were born by bad
[3:31:53] people and they love the devil so
[3:31:57] much
[3:32:09] Lord there are some families who kept
[3:32:13] their daughters from getting pregnant if
[3:32:16] you get
[3:32:23] pregnant if a child would get pregnant
[3:32:25] before
[3:32:28] marri they would take that girl near a
[3:32:32] river where there would be a
[3:32:34] cliff and they will push them
[3:32:39] there to die so that other people will
[3:32:42] fear that that is not supposed to be
[3:32:46] done but there are people who don't
[3:32:48] care let children
[3:32:53] play let grandchildren
[3:33:03] come kind of things they bring God's
[3:33:07] Wrath oh
[3:33:09] God
[3:33:11] in the Old
[3:33:13] Testament those kind of children were
[3:33:15] not forgiven up to the fourth
[3:33:22] generation those people could not even
[3:33:24] go to Fellowship until the fourth
[3:33:30] generation but today they have some

[3:35:58] following the Bible
[3:36:01] says don't be with such kind of

[3:53:59] up let me read
[3:54:07] this
[3:54:19] it started like
[3:54:21] this the the word
[3:54:26] molds God's character to
[3:54:32] us and
[3:54:35] anything that try to be mixed with that
[3:54:42] character breaks
[3:54:47] the you can't mix Creed with the
[3:54:54] word you can't mix the world with the
[3:55:02] word Jesus say you can't serve God and M
[3:55:13] means the
[3:55:16] world you can't be one or the
[3:55:22] other if you love the
[3:55:26] world and all the things of the
[3:55:30] world the love of God not even in
[3:55:37] you is that true
[3:55:40] then you see you can't
[3:55:44] mix you can't mix oil and
[3:55:49] water it just won't
[3:55:52] mix you

[3:58:41] so let
[3:58:42] us let us not add and let us not
[3:58:46] subtract praise the

[4:11:27] it
[4:11:29] today Christ is here is here he in the
[4:11:35] brother when I hold his hands I'm
[4:11:39] holding Jesus's
[4:11:41] hands let us not be like
[4:11:46] Pentecost a woman a
[4:11:52] song Jesus was like a mother I would
[4:11:55] have bought for him a
[4:11:58] b if Jesus was like a father I would
[4:12:01] have bought for him a
[4:12:05] carus where is he is
[4:12:08] here if you want to buy it for buy it
[4:12:11] for
[4:12:15] him like what you do for them you do for
[4:12:18] Jesus when you do this one B you have

[4:12:49] be let us not be lovers of ourselves
[4:12:53] because the spirit of this age are
[4:12:56] people but the spirit of
[4:12:58] Christ it gives you the love for the
[4:13:02] Brethren it gives you the love for God
[4:13:05] praise the Lord

[4:13:24] car because it is Jesus it is
[4:13:28] Jesus but you feel
[4:13:31] jealous your jealousy for
[4:13:35] Jesus Praise Jesus
[4:13:39] I'm saying
[4:13:40] this the unity of Christ which he prayed
[4:13:44] for on the day of
[4:13:46] pente it is the Holy Spirit who B bound
[4:13:49] it
[4:13:51] together
[4:13:53] people who were in the
[4:13:55] church each one of
[4:13:57] them saw Jesus on their friends
[4:14:03] head there are pillars of T of Fire
[4:14:10] T of clo tongues of fire were on
[4:14:13] each all of them Jesus entered
[4:14:17] them the
[4:14:18] poor the
[4:14:21] rich the ones
[4:14:24] with don't
[4:14:26] have Jesus
[4:14:28] entered but after
[4:14:30] entering the Bible
[4:14:32] says they loved each
[4:14:36] other
[4:14:37] because they were not loving this body
[4:14:39] but Jesus in them
[4:14:42] hallelujah
[4:14:44] amen let us wind up saying let each one
[4:14:50] see their friend as
[4:14:52] [Music]
[4:14:54] Jesus when you see a friend like Jesus
[4:14:58] when you do bad to
[4:14:59] them it means you have harmed
[4:15:02] Jesus when you do good to them you have

[5:05:09] problem she would just
[5:05:12] faint and disappear for many
[5:05:15] hours and she came she came in the
[5:05:18] church her mother brought her here just
[5:05:23] before actually had sent her back
[5:05:26] home because she was
[5:05:29] fainting nobody knew the problem we have

[5:05:34] the
[5:05:37] medically it started by giving
[5:05:40] blood it started by giving
[5:05:42] blood so when she gave blood she started
[5:05:46] fainting so um and then after
[5:05:50] everything she continued after the
[5:05:53] medication she
[5:05:54] continued they checked blood
[5:05:57] blood so we realized it was a devil but
[5:06:01] here is a testimony

[5:06:43] woman they thought she had
[5:06:46] died because she no
[5:06:49] response but God revealed to
[5:06:52] him she had been healed and so when our

[5:06:58] God that she's here and I called her
[5:07:00] mother to
[5:07:01] come take her away we continue
