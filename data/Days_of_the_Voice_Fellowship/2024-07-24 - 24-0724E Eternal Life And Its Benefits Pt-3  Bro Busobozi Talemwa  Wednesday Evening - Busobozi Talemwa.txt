tell them welcome to the house of Amen we trust that the Lord will minister to you and that you shall be happy to come in the house of the Lord amen amen amen how many are happy to be in the house of the amen let us give the a big of we are reading tonight from The Book of John 5 verse 24 so today I'll be speaking for an hour being that I'm also speaking to evening light so we would like to also greet the Saints evening light bright Tabernacle uh fellowshipping with us on Zoom tonight so we are taking John 5:24 this is a subject I've been speaking on now this is the third time eternal life and all its benefits you would call it part three but to the Saints on Zoom I think it won't it won't matter even if you not had the first two parts I trust that with this little sharing tonight will be a blessing amen we are reading vers 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me has everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but is passed from death and into life amen you may be seated okay so I'm uh speaking on eternal life and all its [Music] benefits so we have been on this subject for the third time now tonight and uh those who have been following I'm sure that you are being blessed by this the reason for us to share this uh is um for us to know where we belong for us to know who we are what what we are waiting for what we are expecting to happen uh because we are not just Christians we are the bride are you following me we are not just Christians or following Christ we are the bride I want to emphasize that there are many Christians in the world [Music] today people who claim to believe on the Lord Jesus and indeed they believe and some of those or many of those who claim to believe on the Lord Jesus they do not have eternal life the reason why they don't have eternal life is because they have not subjected their souls fully under the word they claim they believe they claim they understand the Bible but when it comes to living the life they do not have the ability to live the life just follow me and don't don't lose the thought now they don't have the ability to to to to uh to live the life because they they do not believe you see you can only live the life of the word if the life of the word is in you did you know you cannot actually believe the word and leave the word if the life of the word is not in you and that life is eternal it's eternal life it's a life of God it is zoy and there is only one source of life that is zoy God is own life but you see if you have that life in you it means you are filled with the spirit of God and if you're filled with the spirit of God it means you are a candidate for the so you see it can if every Christian is not going to the Rapture it can only mean that there are many who claimed they believed but they actually did not believe because we are going to go in the Rapture on the basis that we have believed the word of God our Prophet told us and he said that full obedience to the full word of God entitles you to the Token the token is the life of God the token is the holy spirit it is a seal the Bible says we are sealed by it until the day of our Redemption the moment you are sealed by the Holy Spirit you cannot be unsealed he abides with you until the day of of your Redemption it is the earnest of the life that Christ purchased for us on the cross I don't know whether you understand what I'm talking about amen if you understand what I'm saying just say Amen whever you are so you see it is a the Hest of the life and um you know the we are not going to receive the life that life we have already received it now and it comes to us in our hearts by Faith by faith in the in in the finished work and I told you that those who are going to go in the Rapture are not going to go to the Rapture by their works you know the the Believers who will go in the rure it will be because they are sealed by the spirit of God and they cannot be sealed by the spirit of God unless they have believed the word with all their heart unless they have accepted to walk in the way in the narrow way the narrow way is the word of God you know when Jesus came on Earth he met the Pharisees the Pharisees claimed to be uh to believe the word and they claimed they were they claimed they were sons of Abraham by faith and of course they said they're sons of Abraham and which means they also from God but when Jesus designed them he said ah you are saying you are sons of Abraham but you would have received me you would have accepted me you would have believed my words but because you don't you are of your father the devil so you see because Jesus was the embodiment of all the word they had believed before they claimed to have believed they had all the theology in their head but they did not have the present truth do you know people can actually believe the Revelation they have in their time but when they fail to receive the word of their day they cannot be called Believers so when I'm talking about believers who are going to go in the Rapture who have believed the word I'm talking about those who have believed the word of their day who have received the revelation of the word of their hour when Paul came he was the messenger of the hour he had the word of the of their day when Iranians came he had the word of their day when Martin came he had the word of their day when col came he had the word of their day when mtin Luther came he had the word of johnley he had the word of William Bram he has the word of our day it is not another Revelation from the Bible it is actually the true revelation of the Bible and we are living in the last days when God has brought the last final Revelation in the age of Paul they were the uh they were the alpha bride were were Alpha bride and all those who died from Paul up to our day they died in Christ and they waiting for the resurrection but now they cannot be resurrected until the Omega bride also shows up who is the Omega bride the Omega bride is the one that comes in the last age the last day the one who will also believe the word of day that's why brother bam said if he was to be asked which generation he would have been in he would say he said that it would be he would have said he would have wanted to be in the last age this is the last age thean Church age but you know God has is doing the final work we are the we are the Omega bride we are the last bride even if you don't feel like that you are you are the Omega bride you are the Omega bride because you are the one who was received the final revelation of the word of the hour after this there is no more Revelation to the Gentiles we have received a full revelation of the full word of God and therefore we are finally ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus he did not come in the first age he did not come in the second age the third fourth but he was prophesied to come in the last age the final age and we are the bride living in the final age waiting to see the the Fulfillment of that prophecy praise the name of the Lord but now speaking of the Bride the bride receives the word the bride believes the word and doesn't take any other man's word he takes only the word of God he says very I un to you he that Heth my word and believe and and and believeth on him that sent me has Everlasting life and I told you that this is present tense he's not talking about shall receive eternal life has already received eternal life tell your neighbor the word is life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord that's why when Jesus came on Earth he was the life he said I am the way the truth the light so the moment you receive the word filled with the Holy Spirit you have received life that is eternal life and the Bible says the moment you receive that eternal life you you cannot come into condemnation you can never come to the Judgment Throne praise the name of the Lord and you know speaking of life you know what is life is is the life of God is the word you know we think it is doctrines is more than doctrines baptism in Jesus name one God no women preachers modesty you know Holiness you know you know Christian Living and allach the truth and the serpent seat the church ages the Seven Seals All these Revelations what is it all of them combined together it is the word of the hour and all those that shall receive the truth he said in in in the Bible it says Thy word is truth and in another place it says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet amen his word is life when you receive that life when you receive that word you are potentially standing with eternal life you do not qualify to come before the white Throne judgment but you qualify to go in Rapture there is nothing can hinder you to go from going to the rapture when you receive the Holy Spirit of course you cannot receive the Holy Spirit without receiving the full when you receive the Holy Spirit you you you you you eternal life is right in you you are just waiting for the change of your body and the good thing about this it is not about your feeling it's not about your thought it's about what he said in his word some many people think I don't feel like I have life I don't feel like I'm going in the Rapture brother do you believe the word have you had an experience with God the only thing you should do is wait for the coming of the Lord rest little bright rest all is well that's why when the prophet preached all the sermons there Shalom rest all is well bright peace everything is done everything is finished the bride is only waiting for one thing for the rapture we are no longer waiting for another man to come we are no longer waiting for another movement to come we are no longer waiting for another Revelation to come oh the revelations which were supposed to come it has already come and we have already received it and we are candidates of the Rapture what makes us worthy what makes us Worthy is only one thing the lamb hallelujah hallelujah his blood which was shed and ours is only to believe only believe if you believe the word if you accept and receive that word the only thing that you are you are remaining with the change of your body because you have received eternal life you are not waiting for eternal life you have received eternal life and the Bible says you sh by the way do we believe the Bible sometimes you read these things they become so common and we ere explain it and we want to over understand it can we tonight take What God Says in his word he says and shall not come into condemnation you have everlasting life and you shall not come into condemnation you have everlasting life and you shall not come into condemnation but he have passed from Death un life so in other words when the white Throne judgment shall come those people that have talked about not qualified to stand before it they will not be before the white Throne judgment no why because they have passed from Death to life they will not have any need of judgment they will not be judged so when when somebody tells you we shall all go before the word thr that does not apply to me it applies to them but as far as I'm concerned I have already passed condemnation I have already passed the Judgment amen and I'm already in life how can I be J when I have life in me how can I be Jud when the life of God himself the creator of Heaven and Earth dwelling in me it is impossible I have already passed some death into life it is present tense present tense praise the name of the Lord yes I know as I told you before that Believers the ones who go in Rapture they will also have their own judgment and that's what Paul meant when he said we will all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ and that will not be judgment unto condemnation it will be it will not be that way it will be accountability maybe one of these days we will go into that subject and talk about it more we will all give an account of how we lived Our Lives how we behaved how we talk to one another how we use the money God gave us how our lives really stood for Christ or not and at the end of it all we will not be th some will w't be thrown to hell they already have all life they already all of them already have life so in other words what is the intent of that judgment that intent is to determine the glory you will have when you get over there praise the name of the Lord Mama as I said we will get into that we will not all have the same Glory will be different glories but you see this white Throne judgment judgment and condemnation [Music] so now we are going to quote from the from the church age book in sadan church age please follow me closely now we all know that John 528 and we can read 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is coming in the which all all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth they that have done good unto the resurrection of life and they that have done evil un the resurrection of the of damnation so you notice this is not the rupture now here he's talking about of course these are the two resurrections we talked about it in the first part these two resurrections one the first one is the Resurrection The Bible here is saying that um the hour is coming in the which that all that in the grave shall hear his voice and they shall they that have done good and resurrection of life and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation so the first resurrection is what we the bride is going to be a part [Music] of the Bible does speak about it in the Book of Revelation probably we get to talk about it in a moment so we see that those who will come in the first resurrection the Bible says the second death will have no power over them now the second death is a destruction of the Souls the second death is for those who will be thrown into hell after the white Throne judgment so now those who come in the first resurrection the second death won't have power over them but they that come in the second Resurrection you see when is the first resurrection the first resurrection is what we are waiting for now it could actually happen any time even any time from this moment as when will it happen it will happen when the last seed of God has come in the moment the last seed enters then the first resurrection will happen but you see that is why the Bible calls the Rapture the catching away of the Bride I am going to be a part of that but you see there is another resurrection that is when all that were dead all that were in the grav all that will be in the gra at the time they will rise up again and where will they go they will rise up to stand before the white Throne judg at that moment they will come to be judged many un condemnation and a few will be given an opportunity to receive life now you see the bride is not among those who shall receive life in the second Resurrection because the bride already has life when she's still on Earth how does she receive Life by Believing on the word by that's why we should always be Bible Believers the word Believers that's why we should never compromise the word amen let the world take away everything from you but hold on to God's unchanging word amen let all the pleasures of life go let all the money go let go hold your hand onto God's unchanging word there you know you are safe our sa is in faith faith in his word as long as he says it we don't care whether the society believes it or not praise the name of the Lord and so in the second Resurrection those will all be judged and a few as we shall see will be given life so John 5:28-29 is not the Rapture for only the dead in Christ will arise from the graves at the time along with the living bride who is still on [Music] earth that is the resurrection of the Bride are you understanding what I'm saying it is recorded in 1 Thessalonians 4: 16 it says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout and with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and then Christ shall rise fast then we which are alive and remain shall be C up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord but here in John 5 28 that all he says that all are going to come forth from the grave he says all are going to resurrect so this resurrection of John 5 is not my resurrection whose Resurrection is it those who will be who will go in the tribulation it's not ours this is the now listen this is the very same resurrection that is spoken of in Revelation 2011 to 15 wherein the dead were brought before the Lord and judged according to their works are you following me Church you know where he says that then I saw both young and and old small and great and and and they all came resurrected they rose up and they all came and stood before and I saw a great white Throne you see and all these came and stood before the and he says and books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and everybody every one of these people was judged according to their Works according to what was written in the books Hallelujah according to their work are you following me so he would judge them according to their works oh my my my he will judge those people according to what they did but the bride was never judged according to what she did that's why they they are very busy saying it doesn't matter what you do but they are not Preparing People for the Rapture but I can tell you the bride it doesn't matter what you do that is for the bride because we are oh Hallelujah we are not going in Rapture on the basis of what we have done or what we have not done are you hearing meelu we are not going in the Rapture on the basis of our failures on the best of our good works our good works are like filthy rocks before God so then how shall he take us to the take us on the basis of his good works amen what is his good work his good work on the cross the shedding of the blood which is shed if your Works can serve you Jesus died in vain but I'm so Jesus did not die in vain he died that I might have life and have life more abund he died that he may save me he died that he may bring the word and I may receive the word and I may eat and feast on the body word of the he died that I might be able to make it on the basis of the blood not on my own Works where do my Works come in my Works come in because I have a revelation of who I am when I know who I am I cannot do the evil works I cannot do the bad works the things I used to do I do them no more why because I know I'm born again because I Know Who I Am The Works I do do I do them because of the Revelation I have when you know you are a son of a king you cannot behave like a poor man the moment you know your father is a king even before you have a coin you will start walking different you will start talking different if people can go to America and they change their talking and they begin talking no no how about when you know you a son of aing oh brother sister you are talking will change your life will change your behavior will change your culture will change your dress will change come on Church everything about you it will change because you now have a revelation of what the blood has done for you have a revelation that you are a son of a king you a daughter of a king when you receive that Revelation you begin behaving different you are saying I'm a royal priesthood I am a holy nation Hallelujah I no longer I cannot reduce that you say byebye to be a you say byebye to clubs you say byebye to fornication amen why because you have a revelation of who you are but none of what we do can purchase a Salvation I am purchased already amen I am the product of the the blood purchased I am the purchase of the blood of Jes Oh Glory to God there is no power in here no power on Earth no power in the of Darkness can hinder me from being Who I Am from being who the word said be why because the word has already purchased me the word has already declared you shall be perfect you shall be in the image of God you will bring forth His Image the Bible says we don't know how we will be but we know when he comes we shall be like him why shall we be like him because we will be in His image the word of God changes us into the image of God you don't see the change happening you don't hear it happening Oh Glory you don't feel it happening but the more you sit under the preaching of the word the changes happening something is happening on the inside and one of these days you begin to see yourself difference your appetite changes a pregnant woman does not know what she wants but what she knows is she wants what she wants why because she's pregnant something on the inside of is pulling for something else something on the inside of our heart is pulling for the word is pulling for some vitamins from the revealed word of the hour that's why when we hear the word we become excited when we hear the word we become happy we become energized why because something on the inside of us is feeding on the hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord Lord and so we see we are going to resurrect we will rise up from the gra to meet the Lord in the a amen so now all those whose names were not on the Book of Life they will be cast in the Lake of Fire we are not talking about the second Resurrection someone told me what about the names of the Bride where are they well I said that in the Book of Life said do we have two books of life I said no we have one book of life but you see the the names of the Bride are in another compartment in the book of life that compartment has something on it no entrance for any non member the only requirement to enter that comp is predestination by faith by grace through the blood I'm confused how come it is the blood and yet was predestinated that is what it means to reserve or to be reserved [Music] he knew me before I even was oh Hallelujah am he planned my life he knew my destination before I even started and he began planning everything amen and he gave me a free moral agent Amen to be able to decide and he knew I will decide in the favor of entering that compartment by believing his word and so he ministered an entrance for me and for you to the others what do we see in the Bible the Bible says in the Book of Genesis the moment man sinned there was two angels I don't know how many maybe I think there were two they were blessed on the way they were blessed on on the east gate to protect the way to the tree of life the way to the tree of life but the bride through the death of Jesus Christ on the cross what does the bride do the bride hears it and believes it what is that the you believe the prophet says you have heard from your the what does that means it means these angels literally release you and the way the to the tree of life is directly ministered to you the permission is granted by a Royal Decree by a royal gr no man can stop you to walk that way Oh My My My and that way no one can walk up there but the pure in amen and when you walk that way you are sure you are going to eat from the Tree of Life and now the Bible says to they that shall overcome I will give of them to eat from the Tree of Life what does it mean we have ministered we have been ministered we have into the way oh what is the way the way is Jesus the way is the message and by receiving this message we are walking on that way we are eating of the tree amen right now we have eternal lifeu we have eternal life we cannot perish just like God cannot perish if I will perish that means God can perish but I know God cannot perish that means I cannot perish I know God is eternal that means I'm Eternal I am here on Earth to represent his attributes amen friends this these things just spark off your heart when you hear amen it just opens up well of water it opens up something you did not know that was actually in existence it oh hallelujah amen amen this young man sent me this John 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinketh of this water shall thir again the Waters of theology the Waters of denomination oh Hallelujah shall thir again that's why they hope from church to church they can never be satisfied but whosoever drink of the water I who Jesus the word shall give him shall never fast but the water that I shall give him shall be in him in him a well of water bringing up into everlasting life oh Hallelujah we have received that well of water by receiving the word we have within us this message which we have received is a well of water in US it can never run dry there is more there is more keep opening your heart God has more for you tell your neighbor God has more for you brother s praise the name of the Lord praise God so we now face the question as to why they should be given eternal life at the Judgment these people since the Epistles seem to conclusively point out that one must possess the spirit of Christ or perish though it seems th we must not discreet the words of Jesus who most pointedly set forth that there are some found in the Book of Life who will ever either receive eternal life before the general Resurrection or after ites not evade this
