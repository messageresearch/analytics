a [Applause] Time what does the end of the story tell total victory for God's seed now it reminded me why we were jumping and shouting not an emotion but a reality even the Jews up to now amen they have a feast called the purm amen and and and if if you look it up and I studied it and it's a joyous Feast it's a joyous Gathering amen and they do it in remembrance of the death of hmon and what they do just to show their position I'm bringing it to you now to show our position they write the name of hmon under their foot and they dance until the name of hmon is erased Well church Well church it's about time the Bride of Jesus Christ all starts worshiping not an emotion the Dynamics on the mechanics reality rejoicing of what Satan is finished he hates Genesis he hates Revelation I know where I come from I know where I'm coming my Bible tells me his end is near brother Timothy said it the end for who Satan but oh glory be to God I have a mansion over there I have a wedding supper waiting for me amen so these meetings we want to make sure Satan under our matter what you need may start writing it down and Hallelujah that's where he belongs well Hallelujah Hallelujah that was [Music] free hallelujah hallelujah my my my the prophet says we should never let the spirit of Revival die you know even when this day is over you will go back to your countries go back to your churches and you may tell me Brother David well you know we don't worship like this you heard the word this week let the worshippers rise they that Worship in spirit and amen so it's not a one day Revival it's not one jubile continuous jubile that's the bride's Revival opening of the word as the bride receiv the word amen so it's not just glorious today and tomorrow it's [Music] back that's not

I lay in s a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded verse six chapter one p 2 verse [Music] to you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which he dis be disobedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner and Stone of stumbling and a rock of fense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed but Uganda Kenya Ethiopia wherever you are you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him who had called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light how many are happy and thankful for the evening light there is light in this gross darkness and we give all the glory to God Amen 1 Corinthians 3 verse 11 just one verse one Corin 11 for other Foundation can no man lay than that is laid which is Jesus Christ [Music] may God God add the blessing to the reading of his word let's bow our heads for a word of prayer dear heavenly father Lord we counted such a great honor to be standing in your presence father millions of people Lord don't have the grace to be standing here Lord God you chose us we are the chosen generation you chose us for such a time as this and father Lord as we surrender now we pray father may you take full control over the service May thy will be done Lord may you take me out of the way and may you speak to us Lord God bless the speaker and bless the hearer father we pray and as these things in Jesus Christ name amen you may be seated for a title this morning I'd like to take this is the uniting [Music] time hallelujah hallelujah we saw a couple come forward here yesterday they're about to get married amen and did you see on their face there was a big smile did anybody go to a wedding where there was weeping if that is the case poor you amen so I'm not going to talk about their wedding but I'm going to talk this morning about an invisible Union that is going on right now amen and as we read the scripture in I in Zion the prophet tells us that Zion is always the bride amen and the bride has received a message amen an open book Christ coming down revealing the seals opening the seals amen what is the opening of the SE revealing Jesus Christ who is Jesus Christ our head amen he is our foundation we cannot lay another Foundation but Jesus Christ but he is also our head so many Builders reject that stone for the briide for the Believers it's all a precious stone the stone that in Daniel 2 and for the sake of time you can write it down or you can uh listen to the the the message again but the stone that is referenced in Daniel 2 ver 45 it's the same as in Romans 9 1 also in Revelation 1 amen also in Revelation 10 also in Daniel 7en Daniel 7 speaks of the Ancient of Days whose garment was white as snow ha of his head like pure wo does that sound familiar heard this is the Third Exodus the pillar of fire night amen the cloud by day amen God didn't leave us alone he made sure he made sure said I will send you spirit I will guide you all through the Ancient of Days whose hair is white as wool says I seen the Ancient of Days the same yesterday today forever see when he speaks about it it's in symol form amen his hair was wide as W 10,000 times 10, oh yes and by God's grace it's been photographed just just remind me please what magazine published it was it was it death was it the end of time you think this is just a coincidence with God there is no coincidence it was published in Life Magazine is the only life that is Jesus Christ amen amen so we have the answer to Satan God has Vindicated himself God has proved himself amen his promise in this day amen you know what the prophet says headship is here now that's why so many people many people don't want to accept th precious they reject the message they criticize the cloud they criticize the pillar of fire you know what I just just shows me you know the the Bible tells us that we are known by our [Music] fruits but to those that believe it is precious it's a reality it is life it is my head amen amen Christ the Risen Lord heing the same power of his resurrection you're not hearing me Christ the Risen Lord is here in the same power Resurrection it's God and himself coming to a place amen and he's governed by the body all the way through then the complete body is revealed in the form of a bride that was taken out of his side that's why we are a chosen a pecul with a precious people called me anall people call me a Holy Roller maybe people call me Pentecostal let me back up with the word and I'm going back to my origin the Holy Ghost and Fire reality not an emotion religion denomination experience amen that's why after the opening of the seals the prophet says Amen in the message of rapture the sight of God I took my glasses off I'm not going to ask you to take your eyes off we always look through our eyes we have senses but there's a that has to put this whole body in obedience the word of God so it doesn't matter in your eyes I don't want to know what you think about me I want to know what God thinks about so inside of God the is Justified she's never done it in the first place she's standing there married to The Virtuous Son of God never sinned in the first place she stands there virt John saw what Daniel saw Daniel 12 but he had to seal up those things until the end time John wasn't allowed to speak it in Revelation but what happened when he saw the Plan of Redemption John is a type of the Bride Revelation 10:7 you know that scripture the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he shall begin to sound the mysty of God declared to his now the Greek Lexicon finish to do just as commanded and it says generally involving a notion of time listen carefully now don't fall asleep it's the morning you rest because it's important because when the bride realizes who she is will take place there something important about the opening of the word Christ amen so it shall be finished it says to perform the last act which complet a process it is finished where are the accusers now it is finished but through the lapse of time we forgot who we were why we were here for amen but we are here he what for to manifest God's revelation 22 you know I John saw these things I heard him and when I heard him I fell down to worship before of the Angel we showed things and he said see thou do it not I am thy fellow servant the Brethren of the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God don't worship Him are you hearing me don't worship a man no matter how great God is using Brother Bram says God gives a gift to someone bless him and as soon as he starts he thinks he has something you know what happens God pulls away so if God send us a messenger in our time to reveal the word to what to be a [Music] mouthpiece but to reveal means the seals are broken the Mysteries are revealed you don't need somebody else to come and step on the platform now seven Thunders have their voes we don't need somebody to come and tell us what are about it's been revealed that's what the Thunders is about so worship God and God alone and then verse 10 seal not the sayings of the prophecy of this book The Time Is Now where the word is in the bride to do the Greater Works amen amen amen when you read Daniel or even some read Revelation it's a symbol form but glory be to God bride it's an open book brother Bram says the seven Thunders which equals seven Mysteries already been revealed you don't know it maybe it's some teaching some powerful teaching word they reveal in the Seven Seals but yet are not known to us as Thunders no they were revealed F in the seven SE that's what the Thunders is about amen you are the pure you are the pure virtuous virtuous sinless bride the son of the Living God you know brother Bram he went to visit this uh iron Factory how many remember that story he visit this Factory so the the manager presents him how everything works the and then at the end of the shift there is a big magnet coming down because while the pieces are being made made M are are are fashioned thank you Lord are shaped some pieces so this big magnet comes down to pick up all the metal now brother Bram he visits a manufacturing plant he start screaming Hallelujah glory to God brother what are you so happy [Music] about okay let's have a look at it soon and very soon we are going to see amen the Capone will cap the pyramid only steel is magnetized will be raptured amen the prophet of God tells us without the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen amen amen so that's these meetings are important not because I am here Timothy is here because God Is Here It Ain't About Us don't worship God nothing can stop the seed from being rapt nothing separate us from the love of God and you know the prophet he realized that it was there was something that wasn't magnetized those that were boled down chained down by their Traditions making the word of God of no effect but there is a bride that can Rejoice put Satan at its right place because my head Jesus Christ told me I am precious in His sight amen another thing another thing about a magnet I don't know if you tried it but you know a magnet only magnet magnetizes iron and when the is maged there's something particular happen there's something specific happening this little iron these iron parts when they're magnetized to the big magnet they have a particular specification that when they are magnetized the iron becomes a magnet hallelujah amen yes sir will the bride have a Ministry oh yes Hallelujah the ministry of Jesus Christ Earth now Glory Glory Glory that's why you can only be magnetized to the head no no Apostle no Bishop no church when you're magnetized to this head you won't be raptured but when you're magnetized to the soon very soon amen amen Rapture is certain that's the say the word of God be several raptures don't play the game where you say maybe I for next service you know when you take a bus you can say oh there's another one in the house hour if I miss my plane well maybe there's one tomorrow there's one Rapture make sure you're ready make sure you have the wedding garment watch The Wedding garments the bride has made with the revealed word hallelujah amen amen now the prophet brings the magnet to what I'm speaking about the Capstone will just come right straight together like a magnet and they will just seal right together so let's just fit ourselves to meet that Cornerstone us love and project Our Lives Christ and be sincere stay with the word stay with the word stay with the until when he comes listen how he says it we just fit right in like a glove over the [Music] hand [Music] I don't have to tell my head that he should adjust the wedding dress for uhuh the wedding dress is perfect and he wants to shape me so I can have the the pure word of God that's why the Bible says we'll all have the same [Music] clothes what a spiritual union Christ and his church now when this flesh is becoming the word and the word is becoming flesh manifested Vindicated just what the Bible said would happen in this day and it's happening day by day we are nearing the coming of Jesus amen where the word becomes the word you know we were all accused and are Accused by the but I love what the prophet said from the beginning you were predestinated Hallelujah chosen eled to be a son and a daughter now you that have all this wisdom let me ask you a question where were thou before I laid the found amen when the morning starts sh fors and where what a wonderful time say we are worshiping with Jesus The Plan of Redemption revealed to us that's why I can shout this morning I can worship this morning I am amen hallelujah hallelujah amen amen amen only the predestinated are considered in Redemption redeems means bring back to redeem anything is to bring back my original place that's not my birthplace here on this Earth it's not Uganda it's not the United States United States it's not Switzerland I come from God I go back hallelujah amen glory glory glory to bring it back to that original place that's why God had to bring in this final age bring back all the loose end R all the she can know who she is and she can know what's the original place like the prophet says you've never sinned in the first place does that mean you will never sin on you no no no because he who says that never sins is amen but we have the blood given to us through the blood Jesus oh he washes me me never done in Hallelujah oh redeemed means to be brought back or to be put in the right position come on bride many people reject that stone it's precious to me many people reject the god prous to me what that word does because that's does say the Lord not William Bram he would have made an enormous mistake if he wouldn't have come down but that's thus say the Lord and this word positions me as what as the pure virtuous bride of Jesus Christ why Satan has to be under my amen he has no dominion over me I we should be Satan's Satan's worst night [Applause] amen instead of Satan haunting you down come on bride instead of Satan coming after you you go after Satan come on here Satan let me kill you let me destroy you the pure of Jesus Christ hallelujah what does that mean when you're the bride hallelujah hallelujah when my wife when she goes to the bank when she goes somewhere she goes as Miss Mayer [Music] amen God bless you amen [Applause] hallelujah my [Applause] word word that's what the prophet say because the prophet said nothing of himself was God speaking through amen so if Satan stands in front of you you say the wedding ring is already placed on my fing from before the foundation of the world so get the behind you [Applause] finished amen amen Glory Hallelujah that's to be put in its right position hallelujah hallelujah let's continue men and women are in this earth to be sons and daughters and the Holy Spirit through the blood of Jesus redeems us back to our right position Sons and Daughters we heard preach last night about the Jubilee trumpet you know we have such a great saints that years back it was every 50th year Hallelujah we can have a daily jub why because what was lost what was closed is now being opened to the bride so she can be put back to its rightful position where we had before the foundation of the world and you know what when a slave when a slave once he's redeemed he can never be sold to anymore me [Music] so once you'll be set free you are free [Music] indeed when Satan comes just remind him his rightful position let me ask you a question since when since when the winners do winners listen to losers so not only from this time on the Rapture just put Satan his rightful position that is under my feet my feet Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah today he is standing Among Us in the person of the Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and more and more think of it we have been chosen for such a time as this where God is manifesting himself more and more and more coming into his church amen making himself known just looking for a quote here we might as well destroy utterly destroy coming into his church making himself known because him the bride and the groom will be the same and making himself known and the Word was in the beginning will go back to the beginning which is God that's why we are a word bride and at that day what day thank you Brothers what day this day you shall know that I am in the father here we are you know the prophet speaks about it rising of the Sun in the Bible we can read about the sun amen and then he links it to the s o n how many knows that the moon represents the bride in the natural the moon reflects the [Music] sun okay so let's look what the the words the moon says a prophet is the wife of the sun when the Sun goes away the Moon ref does it reflect its own light does it reflect the light of Bram Tabernacle reflect the the light of my [Applause] church it reflects the light of the s o we are the bride which is the Moon to reflect the light of the gospel and we can't reflect it until he Shines on us until he Shines on Shine On Me Lord Jesus now listen in the natural the moon has given an authority [Music] Hallelujah brother Brown says if you go to the ocean you can see those big and angry wave as they angrily push towards the shore and they would cover the whole earth if they could but God said to the Moon to watch the boundaries of the sea so when the Moon Turns its head the tie goes out when the Moon Turns its head back the tide follows when the moon goes down away goes the tide with it when the moon comes up here comes the tide what the prophet is telling us those big Angry waves of demonic power that try to take a hold of will come and try to against but God has given us an open book Authority when the Moon Turns the tie has to go when she turns back the tie fall it makes me think the Isaiah 59 so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a FL the spirit of the Lord and the redemer shall come to Zion hallelujah hallelujah and then to to them that turn from the transgression into Jacob say the Lord power of the Moon amen amen the Rapture will take place church will be taken home and when we will be taken home and the Great Tribulation will set in they asked the question I thought the church was to be raptured up before the tribulation period he says the church no not the church sorry the church but the bride only the bride is the church the bride is redeemed enemy comes in like a flood there is a bride on the earth draws a liive don't go any further it's about time the bride starts get behind me sat go any further than I claim my God given privileges my family my son my [Music] daughter even when the tie comes no matter how big the way speak to the story who is this man who is this woman amen I'm bringing now Jesus and presentent who was they said who is this man the winde big waves but now in this generation who is this brother the word of God value Let It Be me Lord let it be me Lord that's the time of the unting seven seal open there was silence many people scratched their head happening for the bride there's a real uniting as he Reveals His secrets to his bride glory be to God why should we be afraid of we heard we heard spoke we heard spoke last night of Moses he was going into my quotes I forgive you brother Tim it shows one thing Saints this ain't organization of brother Timothy and Brother David let's try to line up some quotes and this is God on the scene God came down and reot the whole sermon because we know what we have need so we shouldn't be afraid amen how big the waves are How deep the ocean may look fear speak and go for you know why because the pillar of fire and the cloud same with us you're right he's with us and in us you know when they face the Red Sea probably there were some you know there are always critics around whatever you do for God there's always so here stands Moses I've been commissioned just speak the word so now she is there what is Moses going to doing okay now one time says the prophet we t in the Bible that your people when they're in the line of duty and we are in the line of dut when they were crossing the Red Sea and the Sea got in their way on their way to the promised land on my way to canan's land I'm on my way to on my way to I'm on my way God so if there's a sea before me there's a wave before I know my position what happened as the critics were [Music] watching so many people criticize today they miss it million miles or kilometers no we're in Miles here huh kilometers okay but now let's see this Red Sea comes in front of them on their way to the promised land god look down through that Pillar of Fire with Angry Eyes and the Sea got scared to open up saints of God you are not alone he's never left us alone he gave us an open book he proved his word fire is here is still the Satan has to move Satan has to move it's about time the bride realizes brother Brenham tells us this is the uniting time we're not going to the uniting we're going to the feast goes on right tell you Saints I'm getting ready oh for a feast and getting ready doesn't mean I just sit sorry you don't see [Music] it no I heard a jubilee trumpet sound and I'm getting ready for a feast you know what that Feast will be there going to be shouts of Joy that's why I Rejoice already because you know why seen my name in the book Hallelujah my position I go to the angel take the open book I eat the little book I become the little book so I know my name is written in there I have a name written down in glory is mine at that table that table thousands of miles of the wedding supper I have a chair that has my name on it how do you know Brother David because my head me Jesus Christ and nobody can take my SE nobody can take my place God chose me we are a chosen generation we are elected vessels for his glory Oh Glory Hallelujah glory amen hallelujah hallelujah can I continue for a little while Hallelujah is this mine why didn't you give a hand up for praise I can have [Applause] a hallu hall hallelujah hallelujah we saw that John John y when he saw no one was worthy to open the book to break the seals he wept he knew it was over if nobody could but then here comes the land hallelujah amen the original owner the book of redemption in his right hand No Angel no Angelic being nothing else could take the place bloody lamb took the book out of it brother the most Sublime thing in the scripture an act an act an act that not an angel no nothing could do it only the lamb could come for from the right hand him that the now the members of his bride the names were put in the Lamb's Book of Life when was my name written here that's my chair I'll take when was my name written why am I doing this Sint so you start visualizing it that's what happened before the foundation of the world my name was written in the L Book of Life have a place I have a place amen hallelujah and now he says and now it's being revealed names were in there so when John saw that the lamb came forward took the book and not only took the book opened the book everything in heaven everything in on Earth [Music] see my Bible tells me and everything under the Earth so you cannot over people think it's just an emotion since I saw my name in the I am so glad I can but shout I can but give glory to God he has chosen me he has saved me he has redeemed me he has Justified me glorified so everything under the Earth if you find a little animal under the Earth they heard John scream they heard John sh he saw his name in the and they want to call me to Pentecostal an organization the word was restored I will restore he restore us back to the true Pentecost amen H yes we have the full word but if you cannot Rejoice something is wrong with your Revelation something is wrong with the word mechanics so much mechanics that it BEC intellectual you need the Dynamics the mechanics that will take you in the Rapture so if charm a type of the Bride Can shout that everything in heaven everything on Earth and everything under the Earth heard him Rejoice oh let me have my freedom then glory to God the prophet of God says he just really was having a great time Hallelujah now saints of God are you having a good time just for to to to shut up the mouth of the critics you know in the world they say we had such a great time you know we shouted we jum that's not what I mean John when he saw that the lamb came forward he alone was worthy to look no man was worthy so brother [Music] Bram Christ himself came to to reveal himself so then when Jo saw that the lamb opened the book he saw his name he could rejoice and have a good time so when Christ is revealed personally to you you have a good time in the of hallelujah amen that's the reason I think says the prophet trying to find a space to wind up here that's the reason I think John was doing a lot of shouting you know why he must have seen his name and that Revelation can only come from our head to have Jesus Christ as a foundation that's why so many people even in the message this precious stone has been rejected but to me he is my everything so why shouldn't we shout cuz I was lost but I am found I was lost walking in the world having plans maybe to be an actor plans for him amen we can make plans but our plans are not his plan so let's make sure we seek his will first and his will for us is to do exploits amen amen you know coming back to John Let's nail that demon one more time because I hear the sound of Freedom the sound of our Jesus Christ that is blessing his people people are receiving their Revelation position Satan under their feet John must have really had a Pentecost so you go against Pentecost I'm not talking about sou street I'm talking about the upper room experience where brothers and sisters receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the word says when the mighty rushing wind came in amen they climbed out of the windows they wanted to go out what are you brother DAV drunk of new what I have received what I have received is the message of my hand Jesus Christ is uniting right now day by day he had a Pentecost you want to talk about a happy time a happy time I tell my church back home I love to see how can you be in a [Applause] church we got the mechanics the word is so important brother BR says and they say like a dying Cal Hallelujah you call that Dynamics no sir no sir when I hear the word of God telling me my Jesus telling me I am a chosen generation I've been chosen for such a time as this to do the greater work exploit to be his wife oh yes Hallelujah I rather lose my voice worshiping Jesus Christ amen I don't want to be a dying cow want to be a stone I want to be a living Stone giving a sacrifice prise hallelujah hallelujah glory glory glory amen you know Satan those two Spirits Antichrist Spirits Spirit they will be working in the framework of the church in this end time that's why there's so much opposition and they call brother Timothy they call us Pentecostal they haven't got any Revelation and I said I will all respect I don't consider myself better but no matter who you are we're Sinners saved by grace and nobody has the right to appropriate the Revelation that God himself has given it says it's the Revelation that God has given to me come now to reveal you what the seals are Reve you what the Thunders are about no no no you come too late God s meated prophets and told me what the seals are the thund that's why the bride has a true [Applause] Jubilee with the full restoration of the word comes the full restoration of the power come on Saints these are my words are Jesus [Applause] CHR Hall so nobody has a right Christ himself and revealing this Divine reveal truth and we couldn't have a jubilee about that don't mind the noise it's a sound of Freedom those that don't like me don't mind me I have a jubilee within my the joy that nobody can take away the holy ghost that I the world didn't give it to me and the world can't take it away the joy that I have the world didn't give it but Jesus gave it to me nobody can take Hallelujah Glory Glory Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah my [Music] Lord Daniel 11i [Music] you can stay up you can shout you can do whatever [Applause] Lord really trying to find a space here to to wind up Daniel 11 and such as do wickedly against the Covenant shall he corrupt by flattery but the people that know their God they shall be strong and do exploits hallu the lexican the Greek lexican says wickedly to be condemned when he talks about the people it's troops Kindred they that do know the word no is y is to know by experience to be acquainted with to be revealed so this is ain't a man if a man can come and give you a revelation tomorrow somebody else come and give you another Revelation but when my head Jesus CHR reveal himself to me nobody can take it away I am part of his bride to be strong means to Prevail upon to grow firm to be [Applause] secure to be secure no wor his bride we are his any husband who doesn't take good care of his wife is not worthy of his precious wife oh yes we can quote I know I can hurt somebody here speaking wives must be submissive can I quote you the rest of the scriptures love your wife like Christ love so if Christ now think of it if Christ would be like this we would be all lost but he loves us so much that I have no problem submiss so to him saying Lord let it be according to thy I accept it lord I Love You Lord they will do exploits a deed or an act a heric act Heroes of the faith it didn't end in Hebrews 11 because when there will be another brch another book of Acts will be written to us now continue the book of Acts exp heroic act amen amen so that's what we have to do why because the pillar of fire and the cloud our head is with us even in us so why should I shout Brother David when brother brandham went beyond the curtain of there because otherwise I'll preach why don't we stand when brother Bram he goes beyond the curtain of time Saints we are such a blessed people we have proof that the land flowing with so let's not have the defeated attitude let's have the real bride [Music] attitude I am the chosen Jesus so when the Prophet went beyond the curtain of time are you ready he says there that morning that quickening power came and he let me look over the curtain of time you know what he says and I take that for me I seen all of you over there you don't want to believe that that's okay but I Rejoice my Prophet went there told me I've seen you all where were you before you were born when your name was written in the L Book of Life foundation of the world and now by God's grace he came down in our generation to open the Mysteries reveal these truths so we can positionally Beed to so do the exploit Saints put Satan back in it right this is the uniting time from the front to the back this is a United not just some emotion not just anary God comes down we he comes down reveals himself you may be thought weren't worthy but he said I chose you I paid the price my own blood I chose you to be my beloved to be my precious God bless you Saints God bless you Saints hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that's a time of rejoicing hu I might call you up for singing brother it ain't me that live it anymore Christ that lives I'm finishing with that one Christ Living in the individual surrendered fully surrendered then Christ speaks through those lips and things through the mind and even act through the [Music] temperament Lord have thine own way he says hallelujah and then he says how can it be anything but sweet and pleasant all the [Music] time saints of God I don't know how many days lay ahead of us and I know Satan will come on your way as soon as you go back home or even as soon as you go out of the building doors but let me remind you by the word of God you're not just anybody you are a royal priesthood a chosen generation he thought I was [Music] worthy because he chose me and that's why I want to give him all the glory because he called me he placed me and now positioned me here in Uganda wherever to do the explo by faith brother by faith brother by Faith by faith brother by they that know their God they that know their God will do exploits because our God still the same God bless you I love you with the love of the Lord if if we never see each other

Be worship worship rejoicing hallelujah hallelujah there's going to be shouting on the hills of glory amen when we will think talk about these meetings how people were changed how I met God how I delivered how God revealed himself to me that's the Rejoice time we're going to have I love you with all my heart God bless you God bless you hallelujah hallelujah Glory Glory Glory can we sing that

Kenya Benjamin Kenya my fellowship is from Mombasa married Ina most of the churches around here especially here in Cala where I used to come where my wife was but I've been doing some work around family work of God I can give a testimony I think yesterday brother was speaking about me maybe I'll give it another I'm telling him we have the last service begin with you God bless you so much anybody else we've left out we don't want to leave you out I see people pointing somewhere oh yeah where are you from no that is well represented lifebo is famous here so it's not a new thing God bless you you're just L my brother and so I'd like to take uh to to make some special appreciations um some brothers and churches lifeboard Church supported us greatly by in many ways God bless Pastor Robert Jess supported us financially whenever I prepare this meeting I have zero on account but I do it by faith something on my myet I look at the vision that God has from that I believe he supplies so when I when many had several heard about what we were planning to do sent in money and so brother sister that I've mentioned is one of them and our church we announced I do not have the figures before me here but we already announced it to our church so we really appreciate her so much brother brother sent me some money evening light God bless Brothers Jeff the first man who told me I I would he said two things i' would like to come I would like to and also I would like to support and he I think I remember yours properly so I'm I'm sorry say but he gave us $1,000 um for for these meetings and we never did ask for it but he just felt in his heart to give we should appreciate him you should appreciate him Hallelujah brother Mar as well friend and pastor and brother now brother Timothy doesn't ever want to be mentiones brother brothery my pastor brother also gave us some money and you know God has been sending this to support us and you know God has already blessed them you know whatever we have been taking out of these meetings because of these people that sacrifice and support the vision that God has given us and uh we we still have a date of 2.9 Millions I'm happy for for you that uh contributed something yesterday in the offerings and we still have a date of 2.9 must after service will provide we not we're not anxious at all and I want to say this on this note God laid it on my heart that if I'm to invite any visiting minister I should never ask them to sponsor the meetings did I ask you toor the Mee in country and I'm saying this before you before when we see a different a beautiful skin color like this one the people think loed I'm now loed how many that you know that but I want to change this mentality is a wrong mentality a satanic mentality if if God has given someone a Ministry doesn't matter where they're coming from if we want love them to come we should receive them take care of them it should go into our heads as a matter of fact we should not only take care of them we should also give them love offering say Amen so Saints I want us to the remainder of this money give love offering to our brothers listen we we are a younger generation if we don't do it this way our children will also do it the wrong way we have toct some of these things we have to correct some of these and relate with people from America from Canada from whatevers God bless you that we should not worship them I don't worship Him older than me he my Elder same to brother Timothy they all my I don't worship them they my brothers and this is how we should see and I think in of Uganda the only that does it right where the Believers stand up you see these people here let me say this theth the poorest reg in [Music] Uganda how see many of don't down here in the center we used to think there are people who don't dress but when the message went there it changed their mindset and made them dress made them change many of the were here have changed and whenever I go to when we came to I've gone there many times remember I came with a brother from Canada how much money did he give you to arrange a meeting say the truth Pastor say the truth come here on the microphone you have to say the truth I'm sorry this is very important for these youth meetings sorry this is one of the major pastors there Hallelujah for us there how much do you receive for the Youth me for the meetings we arranged how much how much did brother Michael from Canada give you for the meetings ah not yet not yet yeah are you sure yes okay tell us for you but but the other day they give me 1.3 it is me who sent it to you it is not him yeah okay yeah we also talked about that already yeah so so we were talking about um oh you thought it was the brother from Canada that gave you that money no it was not yeah yeah it's not we have that problem by the way I've helped some brethren here Loc yeah and after helping them they think a white man is the one who helped them through me that's a wrong mentality yeah we should change those things friends we are another generation we should take we should we should take the work of God into our hands and do it with all our hearts and with all our resources he wanted to say something yeah even for us in whatever we call the meeting like this one uh we contribute by ourselves yeah some somebody can can give a and then goats and so forth and money because the other time we had a meeting in in over 6,000 people we collected over 40 million and and 30 goats and then and then Bulls yeah a contribution of the Believers okay yeah God bless you yeah it's like that God bless you this is what they do in kja they gather Bulls God bless you these ones are from C it's another end of carja we had a big meeting there I think more than 500 how much money come come and testify how much money did we give you brother and the pastors there of that region you need to confess some of these things it time for confession come clean God bless you Church uh when brother Michael came there never gave us anything but we contributed one one million for that meeting the poorest of the poor collecting one million okay God bless you brother Kang what about when you are coming down here I told you we have brothers from America from Switzerland from New Zealand how much how much transport did I send you nothing nothing h God bless you friends it is the end of that Spirit of begging now I've been misunderstood before I have been misunderstood before there is nothing wrong in me blessing a gift of money to Brother David is there anything wrong with that there is nothing wrong with him gifting me a gift of money if you want we are looking for money to buy our land brother yeah if you we receive it you understand we not going to beg for anything we are sons of God and message has made them who they are and this should make us who we are who what they they are also it should change us the message must Prosper us we must have Vision ourselves we must see what God is going to do if Hees we are the one going to do the work not going to move the gospel need money to do so where will it come from we must make the money we must believe God bless the work of our heart and so I don't believe in begging you're a Begg here help you so that you will stop begging permanent but you you know why we beg here in Africa because we don't give sincerely after arranging a meeting like this tell you spending 12,000 we asking you and then also register yourself so we can know you are coming and then you don't and then you simp show up and after showing up you I have nothing what is this mentality sincer I I believe I am not out of order talk this change this mentality should believe in ourselves I love is a good example I've learned a lot from Pastor it is a village by the way the church is in a village you know why I bring people there let me I want you to see that God can bless you whether you in the city they have a huge Church brother here bu it with his hands with other people in the church I'm telling heed of course the work he did not build by himself but heis but really it was a challenge and so friends I believe we should rise to the challenge and have the burden of supporting the work of God and so I was telling our team that next time if we ask you to register and you don't register ask you that to kindly go back because we are would we be bad let us God bless you the team from Nairobi naobi people this team fromi they all registered they all paid their C fee and they all PID their transport knew that they were coming long before they came that's why we are able to take care of them properly us emulate them God bless you for them so friends I'm sorry I had to take the time to say this it was really on my heart who he is anybody's feelings but I I I'm just saying the what is in my heart Pastor morus in ethopia this is what we taught in Ethiopia and this is what you do and and I believe this this is what we should do here also God is raising a generation friends that will take the work of God forward and we need toise the challenge praise the Lord amen so let us stand our feet and close go for lunch I I had invited my team but they did not come so [Music] okay thank you brother brother Enoch is reminding me that we did not give offering and we need 2.9 Million so we are going
