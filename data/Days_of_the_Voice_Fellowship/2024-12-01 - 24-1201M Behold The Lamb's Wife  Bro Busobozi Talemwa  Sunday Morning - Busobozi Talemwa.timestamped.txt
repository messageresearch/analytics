[2:01:45] amen
[2:01:47] amen praise the
[2:01:49] Lord I think I have one or two more
[2:01:51] things say and then to
[2:01:54] the so our service will be a little
[2:01:56] extended we will not finish at one as
[2:02:00] usual I hope you will be
[2:02:04] understanding um there is um something
[2:02:07] going on
[2:02:10] in um some time
[2:02:13] back when brother shame was it all
[2:02:17] started with shame going to uh that
[2:02:19] College
[2:02:23] that institution the flying
[2:02:27] school and so um then he started some
[2:02:31] kind of
[2:02:35] fellowship and so I was always going
[2:02:39] there I think it was once a
[2:02:42] week and it was a good thing because
[2:02:46] many people had the
[2:02:48] word many loved it and I I don't
[2:02:52] remember but I I know several were
[2:02:55] baptized sister f happens to be one of
[2:02:58] them and I know some people have thought
[2:03:01] maybe shame preached to her so that he
[2:03:04] can marry
[2:03:09] her as your pastor can stand
[2:03:12] here and as a father also of
[2:03:15] sh and declare to you if I even sense or
[2:03:20] smelt it
[2:03:23] I would not have supported him in
[2:03:27] marrying her why because I would know it
[2:03:31] won't work out we don't believe that
[2:03:33] someone you should convert someone for
[2:03:35] you to marry
[2:03:39] them we believe God should convert
[2:03:41] someone for you to
[2:03:45] Mar you understand it is possible for
[2:03:48] you to reach out to someone preach to
[2:03:49] them they believe you and then later on
[2:03:51] without even you planning and then you
[2:03:52] end up
[2:03:58] marrying but these days people very
[2:04:01] wise they even they can tell now you go
[2:04:03] to
[2:04:06] DF that you know me and then you just go
[2:04:10] there
[2:04:12] Bap and then the young man maybe is
[2:04:14] going
[2:04:17] to and then later on the girl is
[2:04:19] baptized
[2:04:22] two months later the young man comes in
[2:04:24] the
[2:04:26] church there's a sister in your
[2:04:30] church that I have
[2:04:33] loved which which one of
[2:04:36] them sister so and
[2:04:38] so know the sister but she's a new
[2:04:42] believer pastor this one has finished
[2:04:45] me I know I've seen her you know that is
[2:04:50] you know it is you know like being a
[2:04:56] supper you know you are not working
[2:04:59] right you will bring by the way you
[2:05:02] think you are faking
[2:05:04] pastors but you will bring trouble to
[2:05:06] your own home and
[2:05:09] you when it comes to
[2:05:12] marriage don't
[2:05:14] play yes Brothers I think you have to
[2:05:17] tune sound is not really good so don't
[2:05:19] play with marriage
[2:05:22] let God lead you
[2:05:25] in amen and so sister Fe was one of the
[2:05:28] people that really
[2:05:30] believed and um there was another young
[2:05:33] lady I don't know where she is
[2:05:35] now um and the many more things coming
[2:05:38] out because of
[2:05:40] that so well of course they moved they
[2:05:43] got married and moved to
[2:05:46] an and uh you remember there is a sister
[2:05:49] Ruth is not here this morning
[2:05:52] but she one time here
[2:05:55] prophesied and uh to several
[2:05:59] brothers and Sham was one of them and he
[2:06:03] said that it was something about your
[2:06:07] ministry lining up yourself and hearing
[2:06:09] from God and being sure like
[2:06:12] that and so they prayed about it to see
[2:06:17] what um and the it was to do with the
[2:06:19] ministry
[2:06:22] well later on as I told you some time
[2:06:24] back the Lord would continue to show
[2:06:25] brother Shame about the place that he
[2:06:28] was supposed to go
[2:06:32] to um there was a church which he will
[2:06:37] receive and the people there will
[2:06:39] receive the
[2:06:41] message and so he came and shared with
[2:06:44] me I told him do you know the place he
[2:06:48] said yes I know the place but I don't
[2:06:50] know any church there
[2:06:53] I said well if God says
[2:06:55] something he will accomplish it if he
[2:06:58] said it is a
[2:07:00] church you keep looking maybe your eyes
[2:07:03] are not seeing proper whatever God tells
[2:07:06] you if he says you're a
[2:07:09] millionaire and you don't see yourself
[2:07:11] as a
[2:07:12] millionaire believe what God
[2:07:14] say you may not see it but it will
[2:07:17] surely come to
[2:07:18] pass and so later on one day they were
[2:07:22] driving past the
[2:07:24] place and they he called me very excited
[2:07:29] he said I've seen the
[2:07:31] place exactly the way it
[2:07:33] was and um so he walked in there and
[2:07:37] like he saw in the vision he was
[2:07:41] received so today I'd like to say that
[2:07:44] God has been doing a good
[2:07:47] work and he has been how many times have
[2:07:50] you been received there to
[2:07:55] minister they've been going there every
[2:07:57] is it every day or every
[2:08:00] Monday the full
[2:08:03] week every
[2:08:05] morning every
[2:08:07] morning is it for one one week no more
[2:08:13] than yeah so for about a
[2:08:16] month they've been going
[2:08:19] there and U so the good news
[2:08:22] is there are several people there who
[2:08:25] have decided to be
[2:08:29] baptized amen and the better news
[2:08:33] is some of them are here this
[2:08:37] morning
[2:08:38] Hallelujah I have not met them yet so
[2:08:41] can you stand if you're
[2:08:42] here if you're from that
[2:08:46] institution the Lord hallelujah God
[2:08:49] bless you
[2:08:57] amen this is not about our
[2:09:00] church about shame or about them it's
[2:09:04] about the
[2:09:06] word amen it's about Christ revealing
[2:09:09] himself to his
[2:09:11] children amen and so we will be
[2:09:14] baptizing them right after the
[2:09:17] service I know there are
[2:09:19] more and will be looking forward to have
[2:09:23] them God is doing something
[2:09:27] in something is happening
[2:09:31] there and um in the Same Same
[2:09:34] Spirit there's a
[2:09:36] brother who has been following our
[2:09:39] services here for a while
[2:09:43] now I think for about a year I'm not to
[2:09:47] sure um I did not know him
[2:09:52] but one time he contacted me and then we
[2:09:54] lost contact again but I did not know he
[2:09:55] was still following the online
[2:10:02] services and uh so um recently he came
[2:10:06] and we had some
[2:10:10] fellowship and told me that the Lord was
[2:10:13] leading
[2:10:15] him to come and be mentored by this
[2:10:19] ministry and be a part of this
[2:10:22] ministry well I I always told you I
[2:10:25] believe in the leadership of the Holy
[2:10:29] Spirit and if the Lord uh if someone
[2:10:33] tells me the Lord is leading
[2:10:35] them to do anything I want to stand
[2:10:38] behind
[2:10:39] that amen I would it is better I find
[2:10:44] out later I was
[2:10:47] wrong than to hinder the Holy Spirit
[2:10:52] and I find out I was wrong about
[2:10:55] it and so there there have been several
[2:10:57] messages and visions and
[2:11:01] dreams all I can say is that the Lord
[2:11:03] has led this young
[2:11:05] man and he's a minister of the
[2:11:09] Gospel uh and I did not I had never had
[2:11:13] him
[2:11:14] preach so I did not really know what
[2:11:17] type of person he
[2:11:19] is butth I saw met him on
[2:11:23] Friday and is the brother who ministered
[2:11:25] for us here on
[2:11:26] [Music]
[2:11:29] Friday so I I I now know most of you who
[2:11:32] are here on Friday are clapping because
[2:11:34] you
[2:11:37] know amen and so brother

[2:20:27] like I said a little kind of pastoral
[2:20:31] message um where we we get into more

[2:20:42] where you just you know uh say
[2:20:45] hallelujah
[2:20:47] amen sometimes it may be you to just sit

[2:20:54] listen and um of course rejoice as you
[2:20:57] are he
[2:20:59] the behold the Lamb's
[2:21:04] wife the scriptures I have
[2:21:07] read have a
[2:21:10] lot uh but I only want to take one
[2:21:13] portion just one
[2:21:16] line in Revelation 21 he says come he I
[2:21:19] will show thee the
[2:21:23] bride the Lamb's
[2:21:25] wife so the lamb has a
[2:21:29] wife amen before I continue I want to
[2:21:32] say I am
[2:21:37] she amen the church is the wife of the
[2:21:42] Lamb so don't try to figure out that's
[2:21:45] it that's what I'm talking
[2:21:47] about now he says let us be glad and
[2:21:51] rejoice and give honor to him for the
[2:21:55] marriage of the Lamb is
[2:21:57] come and his wife has made herself
[2:22:02] ready so when we talk about the wife of
[2:22:08] Christ the Lamb's
[2:22:10] wife we are not talking about the whole
[2:22:13] chrisan
[2:22:16] chrom all denominations
[2:22:18] no please listen
[2:22:21] not all so-call Christians are the wife
[2:22:25] of of
[2:22:28] Christ well they claim to be but that
[2:22:32] doesn't mean they
[2:22:34] are he has a wife he
[2:22:38] recognizes if you want to understand it
[2:22:40] then you you you go and study the Book
[2:22:42] of
[2:22:44] Esther there were many types of
[2:22:48] women that were prepared to go and meet
[2:22:51] the
[2:22:53] king there was only one called the
[2:22:57] wife I will talk about about that a
[2:23:00] little bit later on but maybe just to
[2:23:02] give a little bit of opening here we see
[2:23:06] that there was a group that
[2:23:09] went and this there were three different
[2:23:13] types the first the place where the
[2:23:15] women were
[2:23:17] kept those who have never met the king
[2:23:21] and there was a second
[2:23:23] group those who have never met the king
[2:23:26] would
[2:23:26] now be you know promoted or would
[2:23:29] progress and go to meet the
[2:23:34] king but before they met the
[2:23:37] king they were asked a
[2:23:39] question do you have anything else you
[2:23:44] need maybe they would say
[2:23:46] yes I need some eye pencil
[2:23:51] I need some
[2:23:52] makeup I need some earing I need some
[2:23:56] extra this because I want when I see the
[2:24:00] king I want him to fall in love with
[2:24:04] me I want to attract him I want to look
[2:24:08] so
[2:24:09] beautiful I want to look so
[2:24:12] irresistible oh one time we'll talk
[2:24:14] about that book
[2:24:15] of and then the these women would all
[2:24:19] come and go to the king one by one but
[2:24:24] you see as they came one by
[2:24:26] one they were rejected one by
[2:24:30] one but there was another
[2:24:33] woman this woman was a
[2:24:36] Jew and her name was
[2:24:40] Hada and you know she was given the name
[2:24:44] Esther but you see this woman when also
[2:24:47] hard time
[2:24:48] came and they her what else what other
[2:24:52] thing do you
[2:24:54] need she would say I want
[2:24:58] nothing all I want is the
[2:25:01] KY all I want is the
[2:25:04] KY throw away your
[2:25:06] makeup throw away your eye pencils throw
[2:25:10] away your earrings throw away your
[2:25:13] lipstick all I want is The King and I
[2:25:17] know the King when he sees me
[2:25:20] he will love me for who I
[2:25:23] am amen and I when I see him I will love
[2:25:27] him for who he
[2:25:29] is Take Me To The
[2:25:33] King and Esther came and when the king
[2:25:36] saw his oh the King was smitten in the
[2:25:42] house
[2:25:43] hallelujah oh my praise God the King was
[2:25:47] smitten the king loved her
[2:25:51] the king amen received her and
[2:25:54] immediately the king took her for a
[2:25:57] wife him and the other women when they
[2:25:59] left the
[2:26:00] king they went into another
[2:26:03] house they did not go back in the house
[2:26:06] of the
[2:26:08] virgins they now went in the house of
[2:26:11] the
[2:26:13] contant because the king had seen
[2:26:15] them but the king had rejected them he
[2:26:19] did not have
[2:26:20] desire to have a further knowledge of
[2:26:23] them so he sent them away and they went
[2:26:27] into another house where they had
[2:26:30] another
[2:26:32] chamberline who was taking care of them
[2:26:35] and you know that is the house of the
[2:26:39] con and now these women in the house of
[2:26:42] the con you know they would never ever
[2:26:46] be given a chance again
[2:26:50] in the presence of the
[2:26:52] king why because the king did not desire
[2:26:56] them amen but you see the king kept
[2:27:00] flourish you know giving them all the
[2:27:02] gifts they
[2:27:05] needed because they had met the
[2:27:07] king sound is I'm still struggling you
[2:27:10] know because they had met the
[2:27:12] king you know they did not they were
[2:27:15] they were not like the
[2:27:16] others who did not meet the king so the
[2:27:19] king gave them
[2:27:21] gifts every day so their work
[2:27:25] was listen to me now their work was to
[2:27:29] Simply wake up in the morning and open
[2:27:33] gifts open gifts gift after gifts gifts
[2:27:37] after gifts but they will never see the
[2:27:41] King
[2:27:43] again I don't want to be that kind of
[2:27:46] woman who has all gifts
[2:27:50] but I don't have the king and we have
[2:27:53] those spiritual groups
[2:27:55] today praise the Lord that's better
[2:27:58] brother sh we have many of those women
[2:28:00] now remember woman is a type of a
[2:28:05] church you know they have all gifts they
[2:28:08] can heal the sick they can you know the
[2:28:11] lamb can walk the blind can see
[2:28:15] they but they don't have the king
[2:28:20] because the king is the
[2:28:23] word Jesus is the king and the Bible in
[2:28:26] the Book of
[2:28:27] Revelation says his name is the word of
[2:28:32] God in the beginning was the word and
[2:28:36] the Word was with God and the Word was
[2:28:39] God and the Word was made
[2:28:42] flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld
[2:28:45] his glory the only Glory begotten of the
[2:28:49] father
[2:28:50] full of GRA
[2:28:52] and so who is Jesus Jesus is God in
[2:28:57] flesh Jesus is the
[2:29:00] word Jesus is the
[2:29:02] king are you hearing me now we not is
[2:29:06] that these people have the gifts of
[2:29:09] Jesus but they don't have Jesus the
[2:29:14] word amen but here was another woman and
[2:29:18] her name was Esther
[2:29:20] es received the king and Esther had full
[2:29:24] access to the king
[2:29:29] 247 and if you have access to the
[2:29:32] king you have access to all his
[2:29:37] gifts everything he has to offer you
[2:29:40] have access
[2:29:42] to listen the true bride of
[2:29:45] Christ does not go seeking for miracles
[2:29:52] 90% of church people today this
[2:29:57] morning they have gone in a
[2:30:00] church they seated in a church because
[2:30:03] they want a
[2:30:06] miracle let me tell you the true bride
[2:30:09] of
[2:30:10] Christ does not go around shopping for
[2:30:15] miracles I will tell you what she will
[2:30:17] be
[2:30:17] like in Mark 16
[2:30:21] the Bible says these signs shall follow
[2:30:25] them that
[2:30:27] believe what do they believe they
[2:30:31] believe the
[2:30:32] word they receive the opening of the
[2:30:36] word the signs and
[2:30:39] wonders the Miracles the
[2:30:41] power it has to follow
[2:30:44] them but they will not go looking for
[2:30:47] it rather just believe the word
[2:30:51] the Miracles will
[2:30:53] follow
[2:30:56] amen receive the word the word all the
[2:31:00] time every time of your life and God has
[2:31:03] to back it up with miracles signs
[2:31:07] wonders
[2:31:14] power and we see Esther was the true
[2:31:18] wife of the king
[2:31:21] amen and so the Bible now says let us be
[2:31:24] glad and rejoice amen and give honor to
[2:31:29] him for the marriage of the Lamb is
[2:31:33] come Jesus is the Lamb of God that takes
[2:31:36] the of the
[2:31:38] world but lamb also points to the
[2:31:41] sacrifice
[2:31:43] he he B his
[2:31:45] wife with a very expensive price
[2:31:49] that no one could
[2:31:51] pay and so his wife his wife which is
[2:31:54] his true church has made herself
[2:31:59] ready and to her was granted that she
[2:32:01] could be arrayed in fine linen clean and
[2:32:09] white blessed are they which are called
[2:32:11] unto the marriage supp
[2:32:15] of I want you to see here in the book of
[2:32:19] second Corinthians
[2:32:21] chapter 2 sorry chapter 11 verse
[2:32:25] 2 you know Paul says for I am jealous
[2:32:28] over you with Godly
[2:32:32] jealousy for I am I have espoused you to
[2:32:35] one
[2:32:37] husband that I may present you as a
[2:32:40] chest virgin to
[2:32:43] Christ so now Paul here under the
[2:32:46] anointing tells the
[2:32:48] Corinthians that that I have espoused
[2:32:52] you I have engaged
[2:32:55] you to one
[2:32:57] husband listen Church the gospel is all
[2:33:02] about

[2:33:38] controller he leads you everything he
[2:33:41] tells you you

[2:33:46] flesh so for you you do anything you
[2:33:48] want to do
[2:33:51] every Temptation that comes your way you
[2:33:53] are just defeated because you are under

[2:39:02] stays every day you walk it is not you
[2:39:06] that is working it is Christ
[2:39:09] working in your life you are a
[2:39:12] Christian Church in your bedroom at your
[2:39:16] school Everywhere You Are your work
[2:39:20] place you are a
[2:39:23] Christian
[2:39:25] hallelujah
[2:39:27] hallelujah today I feel I have a lot to
[2:39:30] say I just pray really sincerely I ask
[2:39:33] that you pray with
[2:39:35] me as you hearing the word be in prayer
[2:39:39] let God bring forth what he wants to
[2:39:44] be and so Paul says I have espoused you
[2:39:47] to one husband
[2:39:50] that I may present you as a chest virgin
[2:39:53] to
[2:39:55] Christ Paul wants to take
[2:39:58] us and introduce us to our
[2:40:02] husband oh my good Lord he does he
[2:40:05] doesn't want to present
[2:40:14] us are you
[2:40:16] hearing he wants to present us
[2:40:20] as
[2:40:22] virgins so you mean Jesus is not
[2:40:24] marrying an immortal
[2:40:28] girlus wants
[2:40:33] [Music]
[2:40:34] vir glory to
[2:40:37] God well if you don't agree with me then
[2:40:40] you fight with the Bible because the
[2:40:44] Bible I may present you as a
[2:40:47] chest chest virgin to
[2:40:51] Christ but I
[2:40:54] fear lest by any means as the serpent
[2:40:58] guide
[2:41:03] him through his
[2:41:06] City so your mind should be
[2:41:10] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[2:41:15] Christ are you hearing me Christ is
[2:41:18] going to marry a virtuous
[2:41:22] bride now there are two different
[2:41:26] women there is a woman of virtue that
[2:41:28] the Bible speaks of in in Proverbs
[2:41:33] 31 but you see the woman of proverbs
[2:41:37] 31 is the kind that did everything to
[2:41:40] become
[2:41:41] [Applause]
[2:41:44] virtuous she did that she W up in the
[2:41:46] morning she cooked for everybody
[2:41:49] struggles she does this she does that
[2:41:51] and because of that she's virtuous but
[2:41:55] you see that's not the kind Christ is
[2:41:58] coming
[2:42:01] for but he coming for the
[2:42:04] woman I should say of the Book of
[2:42:09] Esther es oh my praise God is a true
[2:42:14] representation of Grace
[2:42:20] unmerited
[2:42:23] favor she did not deserve it she was
[2:42:28] worthless she was not a good one
[2:42:32] even she not have any good thing on her
[2:42:36] but you see the king loved
[2:42:38] her all the other women tried to do
[2:42:42] something but eser refused it all she
[2:42:47] said the king will see me as I am
[2:42:51] just as I
[2:42:53] am I come to you the true brid it's got
[2:42:58] to be served by
[2:43:00] Grace not by
[2:43:02] works that's why our message is not the
[2:43:05] message of
[2:43:07] Works our message is the message of
[2:43:12] Grace what is
[2:43:14] Grace Hallelujah Grace is receive the
[2:43:18] Holy Ghost
[2:43:20] amen when you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:43:23] amen now you have the power to do the
[2:43:26] works of
[2:43:29] Grace the
[2:43:32] Pentecostals are preaching another type
[2:43:36] of listen
[2:43:38] carefully they are teaching that do
[2:43:41] whatever you want to
[2:43:43] do Grace will
[2:43:45] abound Grace Grace
[2:43:47] Grace uh
[2:43:49] youor
[2:43:53] don't just
[2:43:54] come with your
[2:43:58] mins it doesn't matter how you
[2:44:01] dress is
[2:44:03] available that is
[2:44:06] disgrace it is not
[2:44:08] Grace you are smoking you committing a
[2:44:11] doubt you are doing you are going to
[2:44:14] Club imagine a Christian you in CL
[2:44:19] imagine it right now you're a
[2:44:24] Christian it is a shame and then when
[2:44:27] you come to church your pastor tells you
[2:44:30] no problem will
[2:44:33] for you Christian and you're drinking
[2:44:41] alcohol and then
[2:44:44] afterwards you listen to your pastor you
[2:44:47] are drunk
[2:44:49] said don't worry is enough and then you
[2:44:52] begin
[2:44:54] is in the
[2:44:57] name yet you are
[2:44:59] drunk the Bible says
[2:45:01] drunkards will go to Hell
[2:45:04] Fire are you listening and now so the
[2:45:09] Bible does not
[2:45:11] contradict Grace does not allow us to
[2:45:15] sin but Grace picks us while yet we are
[2:45:18] s
[2:45:19] [Music]
[2:45:21] and he brings us to
[2:45:23] himself he does something that is called
[2:45:30] justification he brings us the way we
[2:45:34] are but when he brings us he begins
[2:45:37] another
[2:45:39] work hallu come on he begins the work of
[2:45:46] sanctification he begins to was
[2:45:49] he begins to cleanse he begins to kick
[2:45:52] out
[2:45:54] every he begins to remove
[2:45:56] everything and then he's not yet done
[2:46:01] while he's at it is preparing your
[2:46:05] heart Amen to remove the very root of
[2:46:10] sin because listen someone can be
[2:46:15] Sanctified no longer doing the bad
[2:46:17] things but the
[2:46:20] desire for those things still there so
[2:46:24] when he has a
[2:46:25] chance will go back again like a dog
[2:46:29] that goes back to
[2:46:30] his let me tell you that when he is
[2:46:34] finished with
[2:46:35] you listen it is
[2:46:39] impossible to go
[2:46:41] [Music]
[2:46:42] back right now be careful about the
[2:46:45] things I'm
[2:46:46] saying because I feel the presence of
[2:46:48] hope God
[2:46:50] it is the truth it is impossible to go
[2:46:54] back why I will tell you why because
[2:46:58] when he
[2:46:59] himself amen has finished to do
[2:47:02] justification
[2:47:04] sanctification then he
[2:47:07] himself he comes and dwells in
[2:47:10] the of your in you in
[2:47:15] you in the midle of your soul
[2:47:19] comes and takes the
[2:47:21] Throne of your heart
[2:47:23] and now he kills every
[2:47:28] desire your flesh will desire those
[2:47:32] things but your
[2:47:35] soul cannot desire
[2:47:37] them and that is why we live overcoming
[2:47:42] life why because the flesh is weak but
[2:47:46] there is a power
[2:47:48] in us the Bible says that is in is
[2:47:55] greater when the Holy Spirit is on the
[2:47:57] ins he
[2:47:59] overcomes he
[2:48:01] subdues the Flesh and he makes it
[2:48:05] powerless he makes it
[2:48:07] sleep and it can no longer overpower
[2:48:12] you that is
[2:48:14] Grace when you receive the Holy Ghost
[2:48:18] you re re the
[2:48:19] Grace from that time on the things you
[2:48:23] do the works you do everything is
[2:48:28] different from what you used to do why
[2:48:31] because he's the one doing
[2:48:34] them not your works
[2:48:38] anymore can you say
[2:48:41] Amen not your works anymore it is his
[2:48:44] work
[2:48:46] now in you
[2:48:50] he is coming for a virtuous
[2:48:56] bride one that has received
[2:48:59] Grace let me show you something go to
[2:49:02] Esther
[2:49:07] 5 now it came to pass on the third day
[2:49:10] that Esther put on her royal apparel and
[2:49:12] stood in the inner Court of the King's
[2:49:14] house over against the King's house and
[2:49:18] the King sat upon his Royal throne in
[2:49:20] the Royal house over against the Gate of
[2:49:23] the house and it was so when the king
[2:49:26] saw Esther the queen standing in the
[2:49:28] court that she obtained favor in his
[2:49:32] sight and the King held out to Esther
[2:49:35] the golden scepter that was in his hand
[2:49:38] so Esther Drew now and touched the top
[2:49:41] of the scepter then say the king unto
[2:49:44] her what Willl thou Queen Esther and
[2:49:48] what is thy request it shall be given
[2:49:51] thee to the half of the
[2:49:54] Kingdom praise the name of the Lord now
[2:49:57] I want you to see this is very
[2:50:00] extraordinary amen you know there was a
[2:50:05] man I think he was called was he called
[2:50:08] one who wanted to kill
[2:50:10] them yes and H wanted to kill them and
[2:50:15] there was another man called
[2:50:20] was a Jew the uncle of
[2:50:23] Esther and um you know the queen no one
[2:50:26] could see the
[2:50:27] queen because the queen was living in a
[2:50:31] chamber let me tell you and I'll write

[2:54:37] listen church we are
[2:54:39] Queens we are the Lamb's wife we should
[2:54:43] be kept away from all isms and Creeds
[2:54:46] and dogmas of man

[2:55:01] M you know started you know he dressed

[2:56:04] don't you maybe you've come to a kingdom
[2:56:07] for such a time as
[2:56:08] this for such a time as this brethren we
[2:56:12] have come to the
[2:56:13] kingdom for such a time as
[2:56:16] this when the spirits are going around
[2:56:19] the world are going around the
[2:56:22] world some people young people love
[2:56:24] saying you it was easy for
[2:56:26] you but for us it is very difficult you
[2:56:30] have come to the kingdom for such a time
[2:56:33] as this because God wants to accomplish
[2:56:37] something but he wants to use
[2:56:40] you everybody say me you have the power
[2:56:45] to overcome all the Demons of
[2:56:50] hallelujah amen
[2:56:53] hallelujah young lady when all the
[2:56:56] others are wearing
[2:56:58] lipsticks and make up and they look like
[2:57:02] Jezebel of the
[2:57:04] Bible you know what happened you know
[2:57:07] the women of that time we are not doing
[2:57:10] that thing but Jezebel was not a
[2:57:14] Believer she came from another land she
[2:57:17] was a pagan let me tell you right here
[2:57:21] makeup is not a sign of
[2:57:25] civilization makeup is a sign of
[2:57:30] paganism even here in Africa before
[2:57:34] civilization we were making
[2:57:37] up both men and
[2:57:39] women you don't know that you look at
[2:57:43] all the ancient
[2:57:45] tribes you know they would pain
[2:57:47] themselves I don't know how they would
[2:57:49] make those things maybe from plants
[2:57:52] and and then from Blood of chicken and
[2:57:54] whatever and then they begin painting
[2:57:57] themselves put things like cut
[2:58:01] sometimes you know cut
[2:58:03] cut and even cut part of the ear
[2:58:08] whatever as a sign of
[2:58:11] makeup you know but you know even in
[2:58:14] America and
[2:58:15] Europe all the ancient tribes and
[2:58:18] Australia wherever it
[2:58:20] is that where in their
[2:58:23] paganism they used to make
[2:58:26] up so was the tribe of
[2:58:30] Jezebel they were pagans they did not
[2:58:33] know God and that's why they were making
[2:58:37] up but you see when you become a
[2:58:40] Christian a of Jesus he delivers you
[2:58:44] from all
[2:58:46] paganism he takes those things away and
[2:58:50] when all others are doing it you cannot
[2:58:53] be attracted to those
[2:58:55] things why because Christ in
[2:58:58] you she just rejects
[2:59:01] it you know Jezebel painted
[2:59:04] herself and she would come in a mirror
[2:59:07] for men to see her well she was supposed
[2:59:10] to be A's
[2:59:11] wife the king but she didn't care she
[2:59:15] wanted other men to see her
[2:59:22] and it's the same Spirit
[2:59:24] today a woman canot paint herself when
[2:59:26] she's going to
[2:59:31] bed you have been shouting by
[2:59:34] now she cannot paint herself when she's
[2:59:37] going to
[2:59:38] bed she cannot paint herself when she's
[2:59:41] at
[2:59:42] home with her husband why your husband
[2:59:46] doesn't need makeup
[2:59:49] but why do you paint yourself when you
[2:59:51] are going
[2:59:53] outan immoral
[2:59:56] spirit that wants other men to be at you
[3:00:01] and you know the children of God no
[3:00:04] matter what generation they are
[3:00:07] in even before our
[3:00:09] generation they have always hated that
[3:00:14] thing why because the spirit of Christ
[3:00:20] rejected amen it's not an immoral
[3:00:24] spirit I tell you younger
[3:00:27] sisters don't worry God has given you
[3:00:30] the power you have come to the
[3:00:33] kingdom such a time as
[3:00:36] this amen we are in a generation where
[3:00:41] we have
[3:00:43] homosexuality let's
[3:00:45] bism and all the spirits are roing
[3:00:49] around they roing around let me tell you
[3:00:52] they will fear no
[3:00:54] one they will fear no
[3:00:57] place they will only fear he that is
[3:01:00] protected under the
[3:01:04] blood but can I say something
[3:01:06] tonight we have come to the
[3:01:09] kingdom for such a time
[3:01:12] as to overcome those
[3:01:15] demons come on to sh their heads
[3:01:19] off shop their legs off their hands off
[3:01:23] to live above them they cannot defeat us
[3:01:28] because we are under the
[3:01:30] token we are the Lambs
[3:01:35] wi hallelujah amen don't accept any of
[3:01:39] these demons to subdue
[3:01:43] you and you are women and you wearing
[3:01:45] trousers
[3:01:48] very soon I'm speaking on that as a
[3:01:51] subject because I've seen in the realm
[3:01:53] of the
[3:01:53] spirit there is a spirit going
[3:01:56] around within the message telling girls
[3:02:00] it is okay to wear trouser the Bible
[3:02:03] does not
[3:02:05] sayar the Bible does not say you should
[3:02:06] not
[3:02:07] wear all right we shall see we will get
[3:02:11] into that but I tell you this this
[3:02:14] morning true Daughters of God will
[3:02:18] overcome that
[3:02:23] Spirit yes sir I remember traveling um
[3:02:27] several
[3:02:29] airports with my wife you know she she
[3:02:33] sometimes has very long
[3:02:36] dresses and sometimes she has those ones
[3:02:38] which are little like what you would
[3:02:40] call a party
[3:02:42] dress and and not too
[3:02:45] short but below the is
[3:02:49] but now when we would want to
[3:02:51] travel she always tells me dear let me
[3:02:55] dress the very long
[3:02:57] one so that I will preach the
[3:03:02] gospel and one day we were at a certain
[3:03:06] airport and there was this group of

[3:03:28] children and those women could not keep
[3:03:31] their eyes off of

[3:03:37] was showing them I am the Lamb's
[3:03:44] wife I am different

[3:03:56] generation have been people the world
[3:04:00] can't
[3:04:01] understand they have done different
[3:04:04] things and because of that the world has
[3:04:07] always hated
[3:04:09] them but you know what they still
[3:04:12] stood they still overcame they still had
[3:04:16] testimony because they were the Lamb's
[3:04:20] wife and so we notice Esther

[3:09:00] Court of the King's
[3:09:03] house against the King's
[3:09:06] house and the King sat upon his Royal
[3:09:10] throne in the Roy house over against the
[3:09:13] Gate of the
[3:09:14] house and it was so when the King saw
[3:09:18] Esther the

[3:12:08] thing she had
[3:12:11] Grace unmerited
[3:12:16] favor when a man chooses you for
[3:12:20] wife you have obtained favor in his
[3:12:26] sight when the king chose
[3:12:29] her she was the
[3:12:33] embodiment
[3:12:35] Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah the
[3:12:40] embodiment of everything the King was
[3:12:48] of his
[3:12:49] character the fact that he CH
[3:12:52] her demonstrated he can never deny
[3:12:56] her she had
[3:12:58] access because she was the
[3:13:01] woman of
[3:13:03] virt but V
[3:13:06] refused now I'm going to read for you
[3:13:08] something which I've not read
[3:13:11] before this was
[3:13:13] preached in the year 1965
[3:13:19] how many were born
[3:13:22] then one
[3:13:24] two only
[3:13:33] two hallelujah amen
[3:13:38] 1965 preached a message called marriage
[3:13:41] and
[3:13:45] divorce this is a very old message but
[3:13:48] I'm going to quote from it I want this
[3:13:51] is a man of God that God used in a
[3:13:52] mighty
[3:13:54] way and listen to what he said these
[3:13:57] people they used to say the way it
[3:14:00] is without fearing how
[3:14:03] it and today I'll read you a few of his
[3:14:06] cour listen but a priest could not do
[3:14:10] that because he had touched oh got a
[3:14:14] woman to be his wife that was already he
[3:14:16] could not get a woman to be his wife
[3:14:18] that was already touched by another man
[3:14:20] because that would be another man's
[3:14:30] wife because that
[3:14:33] shows the VY of the the vcy of the
[3:14:36] Church of the Lord Jesus
[3:14:39] Christ the bride will have to be
[3:14:42] unadulterated
[3:14:48] the word not one word missing
[3:14:53] nowhere certainly could you imagine a
[3:14:56] correct
[3:14:57] bride one breast
[3:15:00] off could you imagine
[3:15:03] that how many brothers would marry a
[3:15:05] sister with
[3:15:10] one could
[3:15:13] you sister who raised up hand sister
[3:15:19] but if you were a brother you would
[3:15:22] not one bre
[3:15:24] off and the other one you know having
[3:15:27] something another
[3:15:29] wrong you know that's not going to be
[3:15:32] the bride of
[3:15:33] Christ she is
[3:15:38] perfect she is everything the
[3:15:44] word no she's everything the word
[3:15:49] my wife is everything
[3:15:52] me why to you if you take to my wife
[3:15:55] thinking she not tell me she tell me
[3:15:58] everything by the way be careful of
[3:16:00] married
[3:16:01] people whatever you tell one another
[3:16:05] will that's why brother
[3:16:07] said when God calls A man also calls his
[3:16:12] wife sometimes I'm surprised when
[3:16:14] sisters are surprised when they when
[3:16:15] they ask to meet me and they find my
[3:16:16] wife wife
[3:16:21] there but Pastor they will not say
[3:16:24] because she's there so they will look at
[3:16:26] me
[3:16:28] look in other words but I wanted to see
[3:16:30] you
[3:16:31] alone if you need me my wife will be
[3:16:34] there she's a part of
[3:16:37] me are you hearing me church when God
[3:16:40] calls a man he also calls his wife she
[3:16:44] everything the man is
[3:16:48] and you find men who talk against their
[3:16:52] wi these ones have they need to be
[3:16:55] straightened because whatever you
[3:16:58] speaking about
[3:17:00] her it is
[3:17:04] you my wife is very dirty by the way you
[3:17:07] also dir that is why she's also
[3:17:11] dir my wife is a hard woman it means
[3:17:14] even you you are very hard
[3:17:17] my wife doesn't pray are you the one who
[3:17:20] prays don't to us as a matter of
[3:17:24] fact
[3:17:26] men women who even pray more than
[3:17:32] them I told you today I would speak
[3:17:34] pastoral
[3:17:35] things if I had someone I don't mean
[3:17:39] it I just want to straighten you
[3:17:43] up that's you see she's perfect
[3:17:47] she is everything the
[3:17:49] word not one word failing
[3:17:52] anywhere are you hearing Church you have
[3:17:55] to keep getting your amens
[3:17:58] coming not one word failing
[3:18:02] anywhere notice he can put her
[3:18:07] away but she cannot put him
[3:18:12] away now here I wanted to think
[3:18:15] spiritually he did it
[3:18:17] has proved it in the days when Lu wi and
[3:18:23] Pentecost when they the denominations
[3:18:28] refused to become the father part of
[3:18:33] him having spiritual sexual fear to
[3:18:36] become pregnant with Father part of the
[3:18:45] word
[3:18:47] denominations they
[3:18:50] refused like
[3:18:53] refused the King was there and happy
[3:18:58] with his people and then he said call me
[3:19:02] my
[3:19:03] wife let me display her you see her
[3:19:08] beauty imagine me calling my
[3:19:11] wife and she
[3:19:14] said the queen said I will not come I
[3:19:18] tell the king I also have a
[3:19:22] party with my
[3:19:25] friend rebellious
[3:19:27] woman and that's how it was when the
[3:19:31] king had that she was so
[3:19:34] sad so
[3:19:37] sad
[3:19:39] sisters always don't be
[3:19:42] rebellious to your
[3:19:43] husband your husband is your lord
[3:19:49] before you think about God think about
[3:19:51] him that's what the Bible
[3:19:54] teaches
[3:19:55] now she was rebellious remember this
[3:19:59] type the church and
[3:20:02] Christ he is the word but the church
[3:20:06] today the
[3:20:08] denominations they have rejected him by
[3:20:12] rejecting the
[3:20:14] word they read in the Bible
[3:20:18] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[3:20:20] Christ they said we shall do father
[3:20:26] son baptism of someone after they have
[3:20:31] believed for us we shall use God
[3:20:36] fathers and do
[3:20:40] babies and then you bring women are not
[3:20:43] supposed to be pastors
[3:20:46] but what are the churches to they
[3:20:49] say for us our women are
[3:20:51] called they are
[3:20:54] anointed they turn down the
[3:20:56] word they refuse to accept the
[3:20:59] word and they take their
[3:21:02] dogmas they their churches are their own
[3:21:08] parties I want to be on a party where
[3:21:11] the king is
[3:21:14] present hallelujah amen when the word is
[3:21:17] preached the king is in the
[3:21:20] car the king is
[3:21:23] present but when the woman the church is
[3:21:27] rebellious the King was so sad and he
[3:21:30] told his
[3:21:32] chamberline what can I do they said Oh
[3:21:36] Long leave the
[3:21:37] king this woman has been
[3:21:40] rebellious therefore what you should do
[3:21:43] chase her away divorce her and marry
[3:21:47] another one so what the king said why I
[3:21:51] love her said no if you keep her all the
[3:21:55] other
[3:21:56] women will do the
[3:21:59] same that's why go to a church where you
[3:22:03] find a pastor's wife
[3:22:08] rebellious which look like if she if she
[3:22:10] pierces your eyes will come
[3:22:17] wearing the
[3:22:19] Min when she sits you just see
[3:22:24] everything and then you know she comes
[3:22:26] on the praise God who is she first
[3:22:30] lady pastor's wife the pastor is the
[3:22:34] bishop this one is the woman
[3:22:38] Bishop yes I don't see any in the Bible
[3:22:42] by the
[3:22:43] way and just in case you don't know
[3:22:46] First Timothy 3 the Bible gives the
[3:22:49] qualifications of a
[3:22:51] bishop he a husband of one
[3:22:55] wife so Bishop is not a
[3:22:58] woman there's nothing like a woman
[3:23:00] bishop and Bishop means
[3:23:03] Pastor nothing like a woman pastor and
[3:23:06] the Bible says he must have his house
[3:23:09] under
[3:23:11] subjection he must rule his house
[3:23:14] well even his wife
[3:23:17] she should be an example but where you
[3:23:19] have a
[3:23:20] church like in that situation whereby
[3:23:24] the woman well she doesn't say she has
[3:23:27] rebelled but by taking and assuming a
[3:23:31] position that is not given to her by the
[3:23:33] word she's a rebellious
[3:23:36] woman and you know she comes and praise
[3:23:39] the Lord
[3:23:40] church and one brother told me there is
[3:23:43] a day they came to church and you know
[3:23:46] the P had gone to visit
[3:23:48] somewhere so that day it was the sister
[3:23:51] preaching but you know these brothers
[3:23:54] the brothers now those
[3:23:58] Andrews all these others the brothers
[3:24:00] who minister in the church when the P
[3:24:02] was not around the sister took over as
[3:24:06] usual so now she was so angered and
[3:24:09] because they came
[3:24:11] late she was Spitting Fire she descended
[3:24:15] on them
[3:24:17] on the ppit you are stupid you don't
[3:24:20] have any knowledge you are not
[3:24:21] respecting the
[3:24:23] anointing because she's in the wrong
[3:24:27] place one brother told me those when I
[3:24:30] told him a woman is not supposed to be a
[3:24:33] pastor I will take you even a
[3:24:37] scenario you see this woman she's
[3:24:40] rebellious because she has refused to
[3:24:42] take her god-given place
[3:24:46] and she has assumed
[3:24:48] responsibility and a position that is
[3:24:51] not given to her by the
[3:24:53] word that is how the church in general
[3:24:56] has
[3:24:57] done they have rejected the word and
[3:25:01] they have taken their Creed
[3:25:04] dogmas and touch mans and
[3:25:07] things but the ran Church
[3:25:10] refused Christ to have any more Desire
[3:25:14] with her
[3:25:16] and let me say this you're going to call
[3:25:19] me something
[3:25:21] anyhow so is it
[3:25:23] today every one of them they fail to
[3:25:26] make that word take that
[3:25:30] word they refuse
[3:25:32] Christ when they refuse that word they
[3:25:36] refuse
[3:25:40] who the Bible is not up for
[3:25:43] debate this Bible is not up for ED
[3:25:48] this Bible is not up for
[3:25:51] revision it's a perfect word of
[3:25:57] God if it says something you don't
[3:26:01] like Drop what you
[3:26:04] had take what it
[3:26:07] say and any woman that refuses a man is
[3:26:13] child he has no right to be a wife to
[3:26:15] him
[3:26:18] I'm quoting remember you remember in the
[3:26:22] Bible when the King married
[3:26:25] Esther because the queen had
[3:26:28] refused he just got him another
[3:26:31] one what happened when she refused to
[3:26:33] come out with the King and Obey
[3:26:36] him the same thing it is with a woman
[3:26:38] that refuses to be wife to a
[3:26:42] husband and so is it today with the
[3:26:45] church
[3:26:47] that refuses to become pregnant in the
[3:26:50] age that we now live
[3:26:58] in words are deeper but I want you to
[3:27:01] understand them in the
[3:27:04] spiritual do I have spiritual Elders
[3:27:08] here all right a church should accept to
[3:27:13] be pred by the word
[3:27:17] meaning you accept the seed
[3:27:20] of the word of your
[3:27:23] day to bring forth children of this
[3:27:27] age let me bring it this way we have had
[3:27:30] many
[3:27:31] generations and many
[3:27:33] ages from
[3:27:37] Ephesus to you know
[3:27:39] pamos and all these Generations the
[3:27:42] church ages the bride is not only coming
[3:27:45] in our generation
[3:27:48] are you hearing me now she she's coming
[3:27:50] from the very first generations of the
[3:27:55] Apostles in every age that bride has to
[3:27:59] accept the word of that
[3:28:03] age but if she rejects it she refuses it
[3:28:08] she is refused by
[3:28:11] the how does that word come in a
[3:28:14] generation
[3:28:16] comes by the
[3:28:18] prophet of that
[3:28:22] age he's the
[3:28:24] chamberline that gives it to
[3:28:26] her we are not
[3:28:29] lutherans we are not
[3:28:31] Wiz neither are we
[3:28:34] Pentecostal we've got to be the children
[3:28:36] of this
[3:28:38] age the
[3:28:46] are supposed to make you feel good I
[3:28:48] hope you
[3:28:49] understand we couldn't be pregnant no so
[3:28:53] what did he do he put her
[3:29:00] away in divorcement but she Dar not put
[3:29:04] him
[3:29:05] away she put her
[3:29:08] away there is no church which can
[3:29:10] divorce
[3:29:13] Christ they cannot but Christ will
[3:29:16] divorce one by
[3:29:18] one and he will marry the one who
[3:29:22] submits to
[3:29:23] him only he went right on revealing his
[3:29:27] word to the
[3:29:30] body and vindicating
[3:29:33] him by
[3:29:35] himself his children begin to kind of
[3:29:37] look more like
[3:29:40] him because it is fully
[3:29:43] mature oh listen become children of the
[3:29:49] word not oh listen to this one now not

[3:35:05] bridegroom to be his bride you must be a
[3:35:09] part of
[3:35:10] him not a part of the cre not a part of
[3:35:14] the church
[3:35:15] are happy if you're a part of us
[3:35:18] here you a part of the
[3:35:20] church but let me tell you when we do
[3:35:24] evangelism we don't evangelize for
[3:35:26] people to become a part of our
[3:35:29] church the denominations do
[3:35:32] that and then they begin
[3:35:34] boasting now we have 2,000
[3:35:37] members
[3:35:38] 10,000 why because they see the
[3:35:42] people no we are evangelizing
[3:35:45] for people to become a part of the
[3:35:50] world if we wanted 20,000 people in one
[3:35:53] year it is
[3:35:56] possible but it is it depends on the way
[3:35:58] you
[3:35:59] Evangel and also the way you preach you
[3:36:02] can't preach the way we
[3:36:04] preach and get those
[3:36:07] masses in the speed at which they
[3:36:11] get can I talk to you as a
[3:36:13] pastor it is impossible
[3:36:16] why because look at the ministry of
[3:36:19] Jesus he had them by great
[3:36:23] thousands and they were all in his
[3:36:25] church and what happened he began
[3:36:28] preaching deep
[3:36:30] things you have to drink me and eat me
[3:36:34] they said ah they all walked
[3:36:38] out and Jesus
[3:36:42] was where would I get the money he
[3:36:45] didn't need the
[3:36:47] people to preach the gospel that's why
[3:36:50] when it's time for
[3:36:51] giving we have a
[3:36:54] project give it is for your
[3:36:58] good if you don't give it's up to
[3:37:01] you but the program of God will
[3:37:05] continue here we don't beg and fast for
[3:37:09] money no right Church begs and FES for
[3:37:12] money
[3:37:15] and spends more time talking about money
[3:37:18] and
[3:37:19] offerings more than time the
[3:37:23] word listen God doesn't need your
[3:37:27] money to run his
[3:37:29] kingdom no God do enough
[3:37:33] power did he need money to multiply the
[3:37:37] fish he need Mone to multiply the
[3:37:41] bread he didn't need those people to do
[3:37:43] that
[3:37:45] does things for the
[3:37:48] people God will do Miracles and
[3:37:52] wonders not for himself for
[3:37:55] you so whatever we do whether it is
[3:37:59] giving whether it is praying whe is
[3:38:02] dressing properly we are doing it for
[3:38:04] the glory of
[3:38:07] God for
[3:38:09] us so that the world can
[3:38:12] know that our God is God
[3:38:16] so we don't evangelize people into our
[3:38:19] church we evangelize them into the body
[3:38:22] of
[3:38:24] Christ yes I know we have fellowship and
[3:38:26] church and all
[3:38:27] that but I'm saying it is more than
[3:38:31] that not part of the
[3:38:33] denomination but the part of
[3:38:37] him that's why when we
[3:38:39] baptize we don't give baptism
[3:38:43] certificate because
[3:38:45] we are not baptizing you into our
[3:38:49] church I know I know some
[3:38:51] denominations they even make you
[3:38:56] say from today I'm a member of Adventist
[3:39:01] Church we don't want you to sign
[3:39:04] anywh do we have a book here that is for
[3:39:07] members no
[3:39:10] members
[3:39:12] fellow hallelujah amen but let me tell
[3:39:16] you you need after baptism to be filled
[3:39:19] with the Holy
[3:39:21] Ghost when you filled with the Holy
[3:39:23] Ghost then that is the
[3:39:27] certificate that you a member of the
[3:39:29] body of
[3:39:34] Christ hallelujah hallelujah we are by
[3:39:38] one
[3:39:40] Spirit are we all
[3:39:43] baptized so we are held we are cut out
[3:39:46] of any other kind of a
[3:39:50] form you've got to be held from the
[3:40:01] word the world cut off of
[3:40:04] you and you just leave the word only
[3:40:08] leave in
[3:40:12] you praise the name of the Lord
[3:40:16] now before I finish I want to talk a
[3:40:18] little bit about the first and the
[3:40:19] second
[3:40:23] Eve and um I want your full attention on
[3:40:27] this 1 Corinthians chapter
[3:40:33] 15
[3:40:40] 45 and so it is written the first Adam
[3:40:43] was made a living Soul the last Adam was
[3:40:45] made a quickening spirit how bit that
[3:40:47] was not first which is spiritual but
[3:40:49] that which is natural and afterward that
[3:40:51] which is spiritual the first man is of
[3:40:52] the earth a the second man is the Lord
[3:40:55] From
[3:40:57] Heaven did you read that do you have
[3:40:59] that yes
[3:41:18] [Music]
[3:41:21] now in the message Christ is the mystery
[3:41:24] of God
[3:41:26] revealed how many love more of the word
[3:41:30] t amen now the complete the complete
[3:41:34] fullness of the godhead
[3:41:37] bods in the
[3:41:41] church in his church
[3:41:48] the
[3:41:51] pinenes all that
[3:41:54] God he powered into
[3:41:56] Christ all Christ words powered into the
[3:42:01] church the
[3:42:03] Believers not
[3:42:05] denomination we will get that in a few
[3:42:08] minutes what is his purpose
[3:42:10] now to now listen church I'm not going
[3:42:14] to just finish I want you to get the
[3:42:16] point of this summon
[3:42:18] today what is his purpose
[3:42:21] now is to express
[3:42:25] himself as a son and now that in him
[3:42:29] might dwell the fullness of the godhead
[3:42:34] Bly that all through the scripture
[3:42:37] that's what God's purpose
[3:42:38] [Music]
[3:42:40] was to express
[3:42:42] himself then through the through
[3:42:46] this life of this
[3:42:49] son his cross the blood it says here of
[3:42:54] his cross that he might reconcile
[3:42:56] himself a
[3:43:02] body
[3:43:03] aght he died so he can get a
[3:43:07] bright which is
[3:43:10] who the second
[3:43:13] Eve you
[3:43:17] and God give it in a
[3:43:19] type as he did Moses and all of them the
[3:43:22] same thing he did in Adam and
[3:43:26] Eve giving a
[3:43:28] type that they were Christ and the
[3:43:33] bride he is the second
[3:43:36] Adam the church is the second
[3:43:40] Eve and as long as the second Eve
[3:43:43] compromises against the word
[3:43:48] now here's the question isn't she doing
[3:43:50] the same thing the first Eve
[3:43:56] did tell your neighbor I will not
[3:44:01] compromise praise the name of the
[3:44:04] Lord and God has hid this
[3:44:07] word from the wise and
[3:44:09] PR decided to reveal to the
[3:44:13] babies hello babies Jesus
[3:44:16] Christ such as would
[3:44:18] Le no
[3:44:20] reasoning I believe the word that's
[3:44:25] all praise the name of the Lord we are
[3:44:28] not going to compromise on the
[3:44:30] word let me tell you what it does to
[3:44:33] compromise on the
[3:44:39] word and then you say God will have
[3:44:41] mercy on me will have and you
[3:44:45] and you do what you do what you know
[3:44:47] you're not supposed to do here is what
[3:44:49] it does in the message time he says the
[3:44:52] serpent
[3:44:53] seed was produced by the first
[3:44:58] Eve by her getting away from the
[3:45:03] world when the first Eve left the
[3:45:06] word It produced
[3:45:10] what what was the name of that serpent
[3:45:13] seed
[3:45:18] because she
[3:45:20] compromised and what has she
[3:45:23] got now she's got a bunch of
[3:45:25] denomination of
[3:45:29] children morally
[3:45:31] good but what about it they dead through
[3:45:34] their
[3:45:37] Creeds Creeds anything which is not in
[3:45:39] the Bible is a Creed which is not
[3:45:43] here that's why we Bible
[3:45:47] Believers and we are alive through
[3:45:50] Christ we are not dead we are
[3:45:53] alive and that's why we should not be
[3:45:56] compromisers of the
[3:46:00] word
[3:46:02] hallelujah and the first Eve
[3:46:05] failed this second Eve she cannot
[3:46:10] fail oh my she's not touched by
[3:46:13] denomination
[3:46:16] no nothing and I want to show you
[3:46:20] here about this bride John 15
[3:46:24] says and I love this verse when I read
[3:46:26] it it says just just read it after me it
[3:46:29] says you have not chosen
[3:46:32] me but I have chosen
[3:46:35] you and ordained you that you should go
[3:46:40] and bring forth
[3:46:42] fruit and that your fruit should
[3:46:46] remain that whatsoever he shall ask of
[3:46:49] the father in my
[3:46:52] name he may give it to you I loved that
[3:46:56] I thought about Esther and I said
[3:46:59] he that's why Esther could not be
[3:47:04] denied because she did not choose
[3:47:06] herself the king chose her and you know
[3:47:10] what the choice this Choice meant one
[3:47:13] thing
[3:47:15] that the king cannot deny
[3:47:18] her the king knew very well what he was
[3:47:21] looking
[3:47:22] for and because the king knew what he
[3:47:24] was looking
[3:47:26] for he knew eser will bring it
[3:47:30] forth let me tell you what the King was
[3:47:32] looking for the King was looking for his
[3:47:37] character in a
[3:47:40] woman so now when he saw
[3:47:43] eser he knew you are the one and he
[3:47:46] chose her so Esther had no
[3:47:50] choice to bring
[3:47:53] forth the character of The
[3:47:57] King and that's why here he says you
[3:47:59] have not chosen
[3:48:01] me God now speaks to our church as
[3:48:05] me this is now I read it for
[3:48:08] me you have not chosen
[3:48:10] me but I have chosen you
[3:48:14] ordained you that you should go forth
[3:48:19] and bring forth
[3:48:23] fruit brother Andre whether you like it
[3:48:26] or
[3:48:27] not if he chose you you are going to
[3:48:31] bring
[3:48:33] the whatever God
[3:48:36] Envision did he choose you you must
[3:48:39] bring the
[3:48:42] FR if you am a
[3:48:46] fornicator he chose
[3:48:48] you who who believes that God chose you
[3:48:51] if God chose you you are
[3:48:55] joking fruits must come
[3:48:58] forth not because you will
[3:49:02] struggle he has said he chose you to
[3:49:05] bring
[3:49:07] Force I don't know how many have
[3:49:09] understood that Ephesians 1:4 says he
[3:49:12] has chosen us
[3:49:14] did he choose us by the way he says in
[3:49:18] him
[3:49:21] Hallelujah first thr I went I'm tired
[3:49:24] that's is an excuse leave it and listen
[3:49:26] what I'm
[3:49:28] saying I'm about to finish you know I'm
[3:49:31] not a very long
[3:49:33] preacher I preach long if I feel is
[3:49:38] necessary so usually I would finish by
[3:49:40] now but give me more minutes
[3:49:45] through
[3:49:46] that now listen you two give me 20 more
[3:49:49] minutes don't
[3:49:51] switch praise the name of the Lord what
[3:49:54] does he say here this is the
[3:49:56] disadvantage of a pastor being a short
[3:50:00] preacher people get used to
[3:50:13] [Music]
[3:50:17] Hallelujah when I was in
[3:50:19] Ethiopia I used to have a sister called
[3:50:22] yod I love that lady she used to fire up
[3:50:25] the whole
[3:50:27] CH even if she sits
[3:50:29] behind she will be a
[3:50:36] firecracker I want I want someone like
[3:50:40] that sister
[3:50:42] preferably Hallelujah it's a
[3:50:47] Ministry oh my all right let's go back
[3:50:50] to this and see how we
[3:50:51] can so he says when did he choose us he
[3:50:55] says he has chosen Us in
[3:50:57] him before the foundation of the
[3:51:02] world that we should be
[3:51:05] holy and without
[3:51:08] blame him in
[3:51:10] love his choice of
[3:51:13] us oh no no no let me bring it down his
[3:51:16] choice of me
[3:51:17] me meant that I must bring forth
[3:51:22] fruit his choice in in his choice of
[3:51:27] me he chose me not just now when I
[3:51:32] accepted not on the day of my
[3:51:35] baptism not on the day I said I am done
[3:51:37] with
[3:51:39] sin but it chose me before the
[3:51:42] foundation of the world
[3:51:46] before listen before there was any
[3:51:48] sin before there was any
[3:51:51] wrongdoing before there was
[3:51:53] anything he saw me and chose me and
[3:51:58] therefore I am here let me declare now I
[3:52:02] am here Amen to do what to bring
[3:52:07] forth to
[3:52:09] reflect his unfailing character
[3:52:14] [Applause]
[3:52:15] I must reflect his power and His
[3:52:21] glory there is no he's not going to send
[3:52:24] angels to reflect his power and
[3:52:27] Glory he's going to send us
[3:52:30] you the one he chose before the
[3:52:33] found amen I am here oh someone tell the
[3:52:39] devil I have
[3:52:41] arrived I am here I was born
[3:52:45] I am here and because I'm here sat be
[3:52:50] careful be careful because I am here to
[3:52:55] reflect his power his
[3:52:59] glory everything God
[3:53:02] is everything he
[3:53:04] represents I am here to reflect
[3:53:07] it the devil can't stop
[3:53:10] that he has hindered
[3:53:13] many has killed many but when Jesus came
[3:53:18] what was he he was the Lamb of
[3:53:22] God why he came to
[3:53:27] reconcile a body for
[3:53:31] himself to bring forth his
[3:53:34] bride to bring
[3:53:37] back his dead
[3:53:39] Church his dead wife so that the the
[3:53:44] Lord can be able to tell
[3:53:49] sat behold the Lamb's
[3:53:53] wife meaning Hallelujah you killed all
[3:53:56] the
[3:53:57] others but you could not even you killed
[3:54:02] me even you killed me on the
[3:54:05] cross but you cannot kill this
[3:54:08] one it was for her that I
[3:54:11] di for her I suffer
[3:54:14] she cannot die
[3:54:17] twice that's why the Bible says we live
[3:54:20] in
[3:54:21] Christ through Christ we
[3:54:24] live we are dead to to
[3:54:27] sin and we are
[3:54:29] alive through
[3:54:32] Christ why because we are the Lamb's
[3:54:36] wife and when we come in the world we
[3:54:39] come to reflect his
[3:54:42] glory don't worry your life May look
[3:54:44] like the glory of God is Not
[3:54:47] Seen but the glory is
[3:54:51] coming glory is
[3:54:53] coming we should begin believing in
[3:54:58] Miracles these Miracles will be
[3:55:02] different from those of the House of
[3:55:07] the these ones will come from the
[3:55:09] knowledge of
[3:55:12] Christ from the relationship with Christ
[3:55:15] don't joke with a gift that comes out of
[3:55:23] loveah when you give a gift to your
[3:55:26] wife even if it's just a
[3:55:29] flower but because she knows you love
[3:55:31] her she will cherish it and use it for
[3:55:34] the glory of
[3:55:36] God in the same way God is going to
[3:55:39] raise gifts Among
[3:55:42] Us Supernatural gifts
[3:55:45] we should believe in those
[3:55:47] things things which will show the power
[3:55:49] of
[3:55:50] God Miracles will
[3:55:53] happen in such ways and
[3:55:57] magnitude that no one can be able to you
[3:56:00] know
[3:56:01] def no one can even you know go back and
[3:56:05] say let me do it
[3:56:07] again talking about things that God will
[3:56:09] do through his
[3:56:13] bride I don't know how many but I I am
[3:56:16] looking for those that are getting ready
[3:56:20] to say I am the Lamb's wife I want him
[3:56:23] to reflect his
[3:56:24] character through my
[3:56:28] life hallelujah
[3:56:30] amen hallelujah
[3:56:34] hallelujah and I'll finish with this
[3:56:36] message the choosing of a
[3:56:39] bride I could not have finished without
[3:56:41] reading this quotes
[3:56:45] again the kind of a
[3:56:47] woman that a man would
[3:56:50] choose will reflect his
[3:56:54] ambition his
[3:56:59] character understanding
[3:57:02] man can they choose a woman who will not
[3:57:05] give birth to
[3:57:07] Children is it possible answer
[3:57:11] Meen it is impossible
[3:57:14] even Christ is wi if he's choosing a
[3:57:17] wife a wife he chooses a wife that will
[3:57:22] bear fruit he wants
[3:57:25] fruits what are his
[3:57:27] fruits it is to show for
[3:57:30] his his

[3:58:50] this my
[3:58:52] business is not going to perish like
[3:58:54] this it is
[3:58:57] impossible because I am the bride of
[3:58:59] Christ hallelujah hallelujah he chose us
[3:59:04] to reflect his
[3:59:05] character even a man when he chooses a
[3:59:09] woman he will reflect his
[3:59:13] character if a man chooses the wrong
[3:59:16] woman it reflects his
[3:59:19] character and what he ties himself
[3:59:21] to it shows truly what is in
[3:59:25] him the brothers can you shout
[3:59:30] amen a woman reflects what is in the
[3:59:36] man when he chooses
[3:59:40] for it shows what is done in him

[4:00:03] man until you watch what he
[4:00:08] has when you see his wife if you want to
[4:00:12] know me look at my
[4:00:14] wife no she's a different type of
[4:00:17] person she is
[4:00:20] me I looked at all women in the
[4:00:23] world and I said she's the best that can
[4:00:26] reflect who I
[4:00:30] am when I see her I see
[4:00:33] myself she's a
[4:00:36] reflection of my
[4:00:38] character I
[4:00:40] am I choose her
[4:00:44] in the same way today if you want to
[4:00:47] know a man see know him by the woman he
[4:00:50] has
[4:00:52] married that's why fear a younger man
[4:00:54] who goes around sleeping with
[4:01:01] nonbelievers he is a
[4:01:06] nonbeliever that's the
[4:01:08] truth watch what a man
[4:01:11] married I go to a man's office
[4:01:14] and he says he's a
[4:01:16] Christian around the
[4:01:18] world and a buy WGY music going
[4:01:22] on you know some of you want to listen
[4:01:24] to that kind of
[4:01:26] music you are
[4:01:28] rotten you need a savior because those
[4:01:31] things you're feeding on are
[4:01:33] rotten you eating on it I don't care
[4:01:37] what he saying I don't believe his
[4:01:40] testimony because his spirit
[4:01:43] feeding on on those things of the
[4:01:51] world those kind of things of the world
[4:01:54] music that's what works for
[4:01:57] you young man when you begin listen to
[4:02:00] eat now begin to feel different you even
[4:02:04] want to pull down
[4:02:07] your because it's a feing
[4:02:11] on you you begin to put on those
[4:02:16] and then you begin walking in
[4:02:19] a because you're feeding on those things
[4:02:23] so it is now leading
[4:02:25] you the character of that
[4:02:28] SP in you even you begin to tune your
[4:02:31] hair in
[4:02:36] that mean you mean
[4:02:39] even connected to the
[4:02:42] music is the spirit you're feeding on
[4:02:46] and that Spirit has
[4:02:47] character it has a
[4:02:49] nature just like the spirit of Christ
[4:02:52] has
[4:02:52] character it has a nature so when you
[4:02:56] feed on it it molds
[4:02:59] you you know we dance here many
[4:03:02] times but watch The Way We Dance is a
[4:03:06] spiritual
[4:03:09] danceing but you go in the dance
[4:03:12] hall actually me I can listen to loud
[4:03:17] music if only it is
[4:03:20] woring my head can't take Wordly loud
[4:03:26] music I can pass
[4:03:29] out I just feel a lot
[4:03:31] of but when it is worshiping God it's
[4:03:35] good Christian music I feel so good
[4:03:38] sometimes I drive and I put on a music
[4:03:42] and I want to increase
[4:03:44] easy so it can blow me
[4:03:47] up as long as it is worshiping my God I
[4:03:52] feel so good and one time I was in the
[4:03:55] car driving and listening to this and I
[4:03:58] was singing
[4:03:59] along I don't remember the St I was
[4:04:02] enjoying it and I did not know sometimes
[4:04:05] it goes
[4:04:06] through so when we were in traffic there
[4:04:10] this man on the side looked at me and he
[4:04:12] had his mou
[4:04:17] he couldn't believe that someone could
[4:04:19] be
[4:04:20] crazy with the music that worships
[4:04:23] God but brother younger brother and
[4:04:26] younger sister be crazy with that kind
[4:04:28] of
[4:04:30] music Let it feed your
[4:04:33] soul so the woman you
[4:04:35] choose you young man shows your
[4:04:40] character all right what you say if you
[4:04:44] would marry a chorus
[4:04:46] girl or if he would marry a sex
[4:04:50] queen or just a pretty mod
[4:05:00] recor it
[4:05:05] reflects it shows what he has in his
[4:05:11] mind what his future home is going to
[4:05:16] be because he has taken this woman to
[4:05:19] raise his children
[4:05:22] by and whatever my good Lord whatever
[4:05:27] she
[4:05:29] is that's the way she will raise those
[4:05:33] children I wish I had a bigger
[4:05:37] voice whatever she
[4:05:41] is the way she dresses the way she talks
[4:05:45] the way she behaves the way she treats
[4:05:47] around with is the way she would raise
[4:05:50] those
[4:05:51] children don't expect don't marry a sex
[4:05:56] Queen
[4:05:59] children I remember many time many years
[4:06:02] ago in
[4:06:03] M we used to have a neighbor and this
[4:06:06] neighbor was a
[4:06:09] drunen I think she was these expensive
[4:06:12] prostitutes you know
[4:06:15] so she somehow got a baby out of
[4:06:18] that and so she would keep going back to
[4:06:21] the club every
[4:06:23] night but you see she used to go with
[4:06:25] that
[4:06:26] child so sad I used to be young but I
[4:06:31] would still feel sad about it and this
[4:06:34] child learned how to drink at a
[4:06:37] very and she was also a
[4:06:40] girl like her mother so you would find
[4:06:43] them at home in the morning a child of
[4:06:47] three years and a mother both having
[4:06:52] hung they were in the club at
[4:06:55] night and you find them
[4:06:58] dancing with all the girl knows how to
[4:07:04] pull the woman you
[4:07:06] marry the way she is is the way she will
[4:07:10] raise your
[4:07:12] children so when you Maring
[4:07:14] brother don't think about
[4:07:19] yourself think about your
[4:07:22] children you are not marrying for
[4:07:24] you you are marrying for your next
[4:07:29] generation and that's why I remember
[4:07:32] when we see these churches and we call
[4:07:34] them Churches of
[4:07:37] Christ you see the Church of Christ by
[4:07:40] the character of Christ in that church
[4:07:47] how they dress how they behave how they
[4:07:50] dance they do their music even our music
[4:07:53] is
[4:07:55] different praise the name of the
[4:07:57] Lord so it
[4:07:59] reflects what is in the man a man takes
[4:08:02] a woman like
[4:08:04] that it shows just what is thinking of
[4:08:06] the
[4:08:08] future 90% of young people
[4:08:13] to get married they think about
[4:08:16] beauty how your children care about
[4:08:20] beauty that my mother is
[4:08:23] beautiful well they won't care about it
[4:08:25] so
[4:08:27] much if they they also in the world
[4:08:32] and and you know these days with
[4:08:36] makeup there is no ugly
[4:08:41] woman there a man who married a woman
[4:08:46] recently later on he took her to
[4:08:49] court and the reason was that he was
[4:08:55] fed you know why because they got had a
[4:08:58] wonderful
[4:08:59] wedding always seeing her but never
[4:09:03] seeing her in the
[4:09:05] morning so when they reached at home
[4:09:07] this time around after
[4:09:09] theed the woman removed the
[4:09:12] eyelids she removed the
[4:09:15] eyebrows she removed the mouth she
[4:09:18] removed the
[4:09:20] ears she removed the
[4:09:22] makeup and before you know
[4:09:25] it when the guy woke up in the
[4:09:28] morning and the
[4:09:30] wig she removed the wig
[4:09:36] also this is a true
[4:09:39] story when the man woke up
[4:09:46] what is it my daddy who is your
[4:09:49] daddy who are
[4:10:00] you and went to went to
[4:10:02] court filing for
[4:10:05] divorce this is not the woman
[4:10:08] I when he saw said what
[4:10:12] she but thank God that in this message
[4:10:16] we don't have sisters who fake
[4:10:19] right we believe in sisters who are
[4:10:24] original be
[4:10:27] natural and brother don't look for
[4:10:30] beauty if you look for a bey
[4:10:33] Queen you will find her but you
[4:10:37] regret find that area of
[4:10:40] character does you have the character
[4:10:42] that you want
[4:10:44] the character of Christ the character of
[4:10:46] the world can could you imagine a
[4:10:49] Christian doing a thing like
[4:10:51] that no sir I could not a true Christian
[4:10:54] will not look for such b
[4:11:00] Queens accus girl Queens he will look
[4:11:04] for Christian
[4:11:06] character you know the way she dress how
[4:11:08] does she
[4:11:09] look let me tell you now the sad news
[4:11:13] to you younger people it doesn't
[4:11:16] matter who you marry they are going to
[4:11:25] change I'm speaking about the physical
[4:11:30] appearance that is going to
[4:11:32] change some of you have showed you the
[4:11:34] picture of my
[4:11:37] wife I don't know if you've not I wish I
[4:11:39] had given
[4:11:41] it Mom you remember how she
[4:11:45] she was who is small
[4:11:47] here I'm seeing all of you are
[4:11:49] big she was really
[4:11:52] tiny all of them are
[4:11:55] big I was even going to call her
[4:11:57] daughter but even as she's
[4:11:59] big she would be nice and small and
[4:12:06] slender that's the truth I'm not I'm not
[4:12:09] trying to Hype it it's the truth it's
[4:12:12] the reality I'm being a pastor this
[4:12:16] morning telling
[4:12:18] reality and I did not no one told me she
[4:12:22] change we had the first child second
[4:12:25] child third child
[4:12:28] fourth and before I knew it before he
[4:12:31] knew it she had added on weight she had
[4:12:34] and there some women who say I won't
[4:12:36] even
[4:12:38] bre why they don't want their breasts to
[4:12:41] sag
[4:12:45] they they don't want their body to
[4:12:47] change they don't want to push child or
[4:12:49] whatever they want even to at seven
[4:12:51] eight
[4:12:56] months so they can go back
[4:13:00] again let me tell you it's a spirited of
[4:13:03] the
[4:13:04] age and when you're
[4:13:06] marrying don't look at physical
[4:13:09] appearance whether she's big or small
[4:13:13] she will
[4:13:14] change hello brother
[4:13:16] sh that's the
[4:13:18] truth brother Andrew I'm not joking it's
[4:13:21] the
[4:13:22] truth is hiding
[4:13:24] himself she would
[4:13:27] change it's the truth so if you're
[4:13:30] marrying a
[4:13:32] woman this one is
[4:13:34] slender look at her
[4:13:36] nails everything is going to
[4:13:39] change look for
[4:13:42] character the other time I was talking
[4:13:43] with my
[4:13:44] wife she told me I should not bring it
[4:13:46] on the
[4:13:48] PO now I've just said it already I'll
[4:13:51] just say a little bit you know I was
[4:13:54] telling
[4:13:56] her that's the problem with
[4:14:00] pastors you know she was wondering
[4:14:03] whether I still love her the way I
[4:14:06] did and I I I said I have to I have to
[4:14:09] be truthful to
[4:14:10] you let me say the truth because you see
[4:14:14] let me tell you the truth when you marry
[4:14:17] and get
[4:14:19] children things begin
[4:14:22] changing people have come in
[4:14:25] between and so she's busy with them time
[4:14:29] you used to give me begins reducing the
[4:14:32] time he used to give you begins reducing
[4:14:35] and many times in marriage you might
[4:14:38] feel like maybe Love Has Changed
[4:14:43] not it has
[4:14:45] changed it has become more
[4:14:50] busy now sometimes I would want to take
[4:14:52] out my wife for ice
[4:14:54] cream one day we wanted to escape from
[4:14:58] home because and then when one child
[4:15:02] had everything was daddy mommy you are
[4:15:06] going
[4:15:07] without I said now we are not so we we
[4:15:12] could not do anything
[4:15:13] but to go with
[4:15:15] everyone it was not fun for me and
[4:15:19] her it was not fun as it used to
[4:15:23] be you see that's why it is good you you
[4:15:25] marry get children quickly take it out
[4:15:27] of the way and begin enjoying life
[4:15:34] together I've heard people who say oh
[4:15:38] you are supporting people to marry
[4:15:40] young I believe in marrying Young
[4:15:45] it
[4:15:48] is when you a sister don't wait to get
[4:15:51] the PHD and
[4:15:53] Mar when a brother comes don't
[4:15:57] keep when you become
[4:16:00] 35 the truth you become
[4:16:03] difficult you have to pray a lot of
[4:16:06] prayers and fast a lot of
[4:16:09] fasting and we shall join you but it is
[4:16:13] more
[4:16:14] difficult no I'm telling you the truth
[4:16:17] you young
[4:16:18] ladies find
[4:16:20] husbands on your knees and believe for
[4:16:23] them when you are
[4:16:26] young 20 to
[4:16:32] 25 that is the
[4:16:35] age of you a woman getting
[4:16:38] married but when when you become
[4:16:41] 2021 you
[4:16:43] them this one has a big
[4:16:46] nose this one is looking bad this one
[4:16:48] has no
[4:16:50] money and then when you become
[4:16:54] 30 I wish the other brother
[4:16:58] the and then he can't come back he has
[4:17:02] already moved on with another sister and

[4:17:33] not a very serious
[4:17:37] believer sister don't wait for that
[4:17:41] time be more serious
[4:17:44] to desire a
[4:17:46] man at the right
[4:17:49] age praise the name of the Lord I have
[4:17:52] to finish somewhere here now I have to
[4:17:54] finish somewhere here and see
[4:17:57] Friends character is what you should be
[4:18:00] looking
[4:18:01] for could you imagine a
[4:18:03] man you know look doing something like
[4:18:06] that but you see the story I was giving
[4:18:09] you just to not leave it hanging and so
[4:18:13] I was telling my
[4:18:14] wife that dear I have to be honest with
[4:18:17] you I I used to love
[4:18:20] you very much but at that time when we
[4:18:25] were starting out I have something to
[4:18:28] confess she said what is it I used to
[4:18:32] think I told her that even if maybe not
[4:18:36] to say that I wanted you to
[4:18:38] die but even if God would have taken you
[4:18:44] I would do I used look at it as an
[4:18:47] opportunity I will have now
[4:18:53] more you're Now
[4:18:56] Quiet that's the truth are used to
[4:18:59] see brother bam had a wife and the wife
[4:19:03] died and I was so foolish in my thoughts
[4:19:05] at that time say ah he was
[4:19:08] blessed he had more than one
[4:19:14] I used to think it's a
[4:19:15] blessing and I was wondering was crying
[4:19:18] and you know saying oh God I will never
[4:19:21] marry again I said what's wrong with
[4:19:23] brother
[4:19:24] bham it's a blessing take it you know
[4:19:28] and so I told my
[4:19:29] wife brother inter you better interpret
[4:19:32] don't think about what I'm saying so I
[4:19:34] told my
[4:19:35] wife that the truth is I I I used to
[4:19:39] think about it that way
[4:19:43] the Bible says be happy with those who
[4:19:45] are happy maybe you can laugh for a
[4:19:46] little
[4:19:51] bit but now I told her I used to be so
[4:19:57] foolish I I told I'll tell you this
[4:20:00] now right
[4:20:02] now I don't know whether she noticed it
[4:20:05] but when I said this I felt even
[4:20:09] tears I told her but now
[4:20:13] I became emotional when I was saying
[4:20:15] that I said I can't even think about
[4:20:20] life
[4:20:23] without this is a woman that prays for
[4:20:27] me a woman that takes care of the
[4:20:30] children prays with the children reads
[4:20:33] the Bible for them teaches them the ways
[4:20:36] of teach them how to be real
[4:20:41] women for me when I go on
[4:20:44] Mission I mean when I come back home I
[4:20:46] get food find hous ready
[4:20:51] andren can you imagine life without
[4:20:54] imagine life
[4:20:57] without so at first my priorities were
[4:21:01] different but after spending 12 years
[4:21:04] with I'm realizing she is
[4:21:08] me life has grown
[4:21:11] Deeper Life has G more
[4:21:13] serious it's no longer
[4:21:23] about no it's no longer it is that and
[4:21:27] much
[4:21:29] more it's that much more it is much more
[4:21:32] than that it is more than physical
[4:21:36] appearance it is it is more than how
[4:21:38] will my children look
[4:21:40] like physically it is it is much more I
[4:21:44] don't know how I can
[4:21:45] explain it's like we've become
[4:21:48] one life without her is
[4:21:51] impossible and that is what happens when
[4:21:53] you marry in
[4:21:56] Christ when you marry character and not
[4:22:00] Beauty when you Mar character and not a
[4:22:03] sex queen or whatever it
[4:22:06] is you see and the prophet says you
[4:22:08] can't have all
[4:22:11] things have old
[4:22:14] things there might be one girl that's
[4:22:16] really
[4:22:18] pretty and the other girl maybe she's a
[4:22:20] St looks like better than this
[4:22:22] one and you might have to sacrifice one
[4:22:25] for the
[4:22:27] other but if she's not the St of a
[4:22:32] lady a woman I don't care whether she's
[4:22:36] pretty or not you better look at her
[4:22:40] character
[4:22:43] whether she's pretty or
[4:22:49] not Brethren there is more I can say but
[4:22:53] I don't want this to be a three hour
[4:22:55] long
[4:22:56] summer but I want to finish saying
[4:22:59] this Christ
[4:23:02] Jesus wants to marry a
[4:23:07] church a
[4:23:08] bride and is called her the Lamb's wife
[4:23:14] he wants to look at her and say she's
[4:23:17] life of my life character of
[4:23:21] my nature of my
[4:23:24] nature she's my
[4:23:26] wife not someone you're always
[4:23:30] fighting let me tell you when you marry
[4:23:34] someone Tri won't even mean a lot
[4:23:37] [Music]
[4:23:41] after won't mean
[4:23:44] much it
[4:23:45] won't how much education she
[4:23:49] has what will it will come down to one
[4:23:53] thing real mother someone who can take
[4:23:57] care of your children someone who will
[4:23:59] love you for who you are someone who you
[4:24:02] will love for who she
[4:24:03] is and that's the way it is with
[4:24:06] Christ it has come down to one
[4:24:09] thing he's saying you are my wife
[4:24:13] because your character is like my
[4:24:16] character you are life of my
[4:24:19] life character of my character nature of
[4:24:22] my nature you are my
[4:24:25] bride that's what Christ looks
[4:24:27] at not how we look but who we
[4:24:32] are and that's why he molds Us in his
[4:24:36] character when we come to him and he
[4:24:39] wants to be able to say at the end of it
[4:24:41] all
[4:24:44] behold the Lamb's
[4:24:48] wife we may stand on our
[4:24:56] feet let us
[4:25:00] pray our heavenly
[4:25:03] father there are many things that have
[4:25:05] been said
[4:25:06] today perhaps a little longer sermon
[4:25:08] than
[4:25:10] usual but these are things that have
