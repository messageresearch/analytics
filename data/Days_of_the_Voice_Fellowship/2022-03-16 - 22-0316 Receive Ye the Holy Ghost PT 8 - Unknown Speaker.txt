[Music] [Music] amen i mean i'm going to invite you at this time to the world before we see it i'm so so happy to see sister [Music] [Music] [Music] um let us read matthew chapter nine matteo and we read verse 27 to verses um 29 mata is i read in the name of the lord and when jesus departed dance two blind men followed him crying and saying thou son of david have mercy on us and when he was come into the house the blind man came to him and jesus said unto them believe ye that i am able to do this they said unto him yeah lord then touched he their eyes saying according to your faith be it unto you yes sir amen hallelujah hallelujah uh hebrews chapter 11 verse 5 to 6. we read it also but we can go through the two verses again by faith enough was translated that he should not see death and was not found because god had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased god but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to god must believe that he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him in lord jesus we ask that you come and take over amen so as usual on wednesday i speak for one hour in gabriel and i intend to do that tonight hallelujah i mean how many we are blessed on sunday sunday amen i believe that every service is a blessing to us something is happening on the inside you always was encouraging me and i appreciate that he ran himself he said uh uh speak as many parts on this subject as the lord will lead you to see again [Music] so and all and i i i hope that somebody here is catching that vision there is actually a brother a fellow minister who was streaming the service from new zealand uh he was streaming us here yeah and so he sent me a testimony afterwards and he said that he was blessed by those comments he was inspired they themselves in their church they don't have a place yet i said he was inspired doesn't that encourage you you know sometimes we stream these services they go you do not know who will listen services has to be a word or two change that much more but you can impact someone competing on another continent uh uh we have already improved from last sunday we're twirling sunday he's sick at the sewage little ginseng commercial i've been looking for the latest one brother joel but i think i can't find him but then [Music] we can do this just trouble let you know and we will do it enough to get you cola and uh i believe before the end of this month we should have passed the 10 our target is to hit and pass the 10 million mark we are pressing on to gain the mass we believe our lord is coming for and we do we are doing all that we can to prepare ourselves to correct your nature to attack yourself together i believe he's calling many more in this area is then the same day at the evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and said unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side then where the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so said are you and when he also said this he breathed on them and he said unto them receive you the holy ghost and whosoever since you remedy they are remitted unto them and whose so ever since ye retained they are retained our um the scriptures which we have read tonight if you want the question and then read a few quotes i believe that would be enough for tonight yet tomorrow so in matthew 9 when jesus came and find um two blind men yes these men were blind maybe they were blind from the time they were children they were blind because of sickness we do not know but these men were blind as jesus departed yes they followed jesus and they were crying unto him nobody cannot son of david have mercy on us today and when he came to stood to them the bible says he when he was coming to the house [Music] there is a little effort that you have to put now according to him some people think it's all about god you see the prophet says he's more willing to give you the holocaust than you are willing but the question is why don't you have it naturally because there is a little effort on your pathway and then jesus said unto them yes believe ye that i am able to do this hallelujah all right i wanted us to realize tonight we have to [Music] there was a time when the children of israel were going to take the promised land while walker said that whenever i sharing go back into trouble and they had to believe they were able foreign march forward to the promised land because they believed for it is a difference so that we are going to attain it against the gift and they cross jordan have to believe for it believing does not end with confessing jesus as your personal savior believing only begins by hearing [Music] they crossed across jordan abandoned and when they they reached the other side the first city they were to take was called jericho how many remember the jericho story jericho must fall yet you know what but i'm going to tell you what you're going to do and you must do it i'm going to take a good chance he said you are going to go around jericho seven times sam there were specific instructions from the lord on how jericho was going to fall hallelujah i mean praise the name of the lord let you know again hallelujah are you following me so far amen now let's get back to jericho and so when the saints reached in jericho about to come here god told them never give up to go around now i wanted to imagine that in warfare like right now russia is attacking ukraine ukraine imagine if the president of russia put in stabilization the only thing you are going to do to take ukraine you have to go around it all day and then the last time you shout out but the way god fights his battles and the way men fight their battles [Music] so the people who went around jericho and they went around jericho and i believe when those people in jericho were seeing them started to laugh at them how strong this city is [Music] amen who are stronger than all those armies and the words of jericho you are your singer [Music] amen can you imagine coming from if the believers all the angels we are there will never yeah they are blessed before we are because none of the jews command already at the normal crisis actually went and literally pulled down the words of jesus in order for you to get the wisdom of god they become fools around jericho they went around jericho they went around it was but they believed it never had to kill them don't think they were going around the building now we are going to imagine going around for example a place like the whole of kampala there is no way going around it they must have spent days and days and days that's why no one touched them as why because something is suddenly happening amazing whatever chicken the man so and these people know as they moved the last round they did what god's word said back to god did you see the quote i sent you on the group today you know but the banham says right with what is in your hands if it is singing sing the gospel if you can't do nothing but we so we suggest as loud as you can for the glory of god hallelujah if you can't do no more than put your hands part them conquer with whatever you got in your hand collapse them in such a way that all the neighbors will love you [Applause] and maybe i want you to understand this evening but when as jesus was departing again [Applause] i don't know [Applause] and these people came to jesus christ side secular not by what they saw but they came to him by faith they believed they were where he was but kids are worried they believed they were aware he was antibiotic and then jesus said unto them yes look at look at this question believe me that i am able to do this and jesus knew that yes situation but these blind men never said that i was very much they had shouted because look it was jesus who went after the disciples and called them yes we are again a night but you get israel and they accept it never kills them but is the blind man never and then jesus came yesterday and when jesus arrived in the house they do so i want to ask you a question did this man believe i was saying did i believe that they believe money that kid is there but god jesus yes she wanted an assurance from me believe me that i am able to do this hallelujah that's why i told you [Music] okay i'm not only abiding in your heart some of us need to learn how to praise how to worship the lord our praise has to come on our lips [Applause] and that kind satisfied with their crying and shouting that is good they are crying and shouting brought to him that has its place you believe you expect to receive the holy ghost when you have never even asked the lord all you do is say he knows i need it because he knows my heart put it on your mouth and then you expect god to give you the holy jesus wanted to hear the words yes yes what do you want tell me so you need to learn how to pray you go don't pray like them out there in the denominations that you have to go in the house tell him he can hear the word and when they spoke then touched e in his eyes and he said he is what i want and their eyes were opened among sugar when they gave it cooker the bible did not say and we don't know what happened to them afterwards and their eyes were opened vibrio don't [Applause] then ask [Applause] oh my we are on the principles of receiving the holy ghost and so we know this that these people had to speak about but nobody knows jesus yes ascribe um this is the principle no no no no and so here one in hebrews he goes ahead and speaks about many many giants of faith verse everything is i know that he is that he is you are tell somebody that he is i wanted to look at uh i want to release something here for marijuana hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord come here i want you to look at uh i i there's a brother who sent me but brother tim fruit sent me something that i i thought was uh quite good for me to read for you organ team and i want to read it for you uh it says i was asked the question agamantee bamboozled how do i receive the baptism of the holy ghost and he says can you add anything to this to help an individual who is seeking the holy spirit to know how to receive him again and he says here is my response repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost then he stated it he said it was a promise that was to them and for their children and to them are far off nagam and charlie sweeps the child never never will never believe our body be wearing you and as many as the lord our god shall be already convinced of their need for reach again they themselves they realized they were in need but again you will not go to the hospital he doesn't run after you to fill you with the holy spirit don't cook over put yourself on him you must have the desire now when you come to church mechanism but no one says that your expectation come of god and these people who were asking of how to receive the holy spirit were already convinced of [Music] you you receive your provisions you are [Music] [Music] when you come to god you must believe that he is well jericho you know christianity hallelujah amen let me go and pray and maybe god will will give me my desires let me go and pray maybe god will he will i believe he will heal me one day let me go and pray i will see what he will do in the future how many believe god will do something in the future wow how many believers you don't believe you will work in the future no no be yourself [Music] amen he must believe that he is and that he is he will reward the diligent seeker [Music] and i'm still reading this text he says you cannot receive anything from god except by this is maybe what i see that many of some have not seen yet i believe this is available to us give me a reason even if it is one why god should that give it to us but i have many reasons in the word of god and which shows us it is you cannot receive anything from god except by and it is for god and it is for god is calling you and it is for god is calling you that way it says god wants you to receive but it is something you must ask for that's why many people don't do believe but they don't have the holy spirit luke 11 13 says if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your heavenly father give the holy spirit to those who ask him what nobody oh lord fill me with your spirit you know my knee what kind of atmosphere is that me that you can't see you but you see these men disciplined men when they came to jesus [Applause] [Music] ask what you want to see if i will not give it to you my way hallelujah amen and then hallelujah amen they say that we believe the lord is [Music] of course the signs and everything these yes amen came to them and he blessed his hand nothing can recover again how long he took it what i know and then i when you thought his eyes open and while hallelujah and if you then say so it begins with a sincere prayer category god cannot feel god cannot nor will he feel a vessel still filled with sin katrina baby he simply will not dwell together with the devils that's sober i paid our money i believe that for sure god cannot work together with devils that the spirit of god is coming here they do not want to sleep alone so they started sharing their breath so but they have a problem yeah i know that when they go they want they they want to share a bed bag they also want to share a blanket never anything but yeah they when they get there they have to come blind you know they get over themselves and i mean you know they start pulling the blankets this one is saying bring blankets [Music] to the exit when sharon goes when we when it is happened to pray and we tell our prayer shadow and she says oh lord i gotta come help us she but you know they are still in the flesh you know and and so that the flesh is usually having those kind of things [Music] and you know things like that the works of the flesh shows that truly the devil is still happening in you the holy spirit is a gentleman amen brother solomon the holy ghost does not compete for species how many believe that you don't want to go to for prayers the things of god don't trust you i mean that of you you are not moved by them [Applause] you always you you you you always pray oh god give me the horse he simply will not dwell together with devils see omar you're just over a better museum habits and music are evil spirits maybe habits i evil spirits maybe i thought i believed that you have to keep them up or not you go back they must be laid on the altar do you not take ever quarterly and you must die out negative to your sins you must die out your sin no area and you must [Music] sacrifice those habits sacrifice those things that give you temporary joy sacrifices that make you happy but for a little while you have to repent and confess your sins but you're not queening hallelujah how many think that that is a good thing they are hearing tonight hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord nearly i'm coming there's something i want to read for you tonight as i finish what are you saying is that the message about the six uh the threefold purpose of the sixth seal [Music] was that the sleeping virgins had to go through the tribulation period for purification she had to be purged over sins of unbelief and rejecting the message over here in revelation 17 between the sixth and seventh chapter here that she had been purged and she'd been given her room but it's the chat the pure people that did have the opportunity maybe to receive a message life they are not in the pride world and they are not in the rapture whatever they receive and they get purified through the you hear the foolish virgin they made it in jesus don't get a chance there's a funny opportunity to hear the message the way you are here hallelujah if you think you are going to be [Applause] and he says you notice that another patching time again is um give them a chance [Music] [Music] purged during the sixth season so the purpose of a sixth seal against what do you think the nuclear warheads are foreign oh now god spoke they took the breast of denominationalists they were given to the they were given the open world by way named is receiving a word about ah zaribani gamble a word burst gamble which is giving them the nature of christ that is amen changing their nature which is in the word of god is the true evidence of the holy spirit and you know there are many evidences of the spirit of god speaking in tongues is one of [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh thank you jesus hallelujah thank you jesus [Music] [Music] yes [Music] baby [Music] me [Music] is [Music] foreign [Music] oh [Music] [Laughter] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] [Applause]
