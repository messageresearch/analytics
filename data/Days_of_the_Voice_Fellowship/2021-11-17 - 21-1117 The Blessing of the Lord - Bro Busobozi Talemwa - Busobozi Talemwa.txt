will close when they close as you do now it will happen amen yes every time we come in the presence of god it is such an opportunity it is such a great honor and even tonight i want you to be expectant to receive from the lord for the bible says he said in his word that where two or three shall be gathered he promised that he will be in their midst amen but as the prophet of the hour preached the message expectation when you come to his presence what are you expecting what is that on your heart did you come to church because every wednesday we come did you come to church because you had nothing to do or you came to church like that woman who had the issue of blood who said i must go where that man is when i reach there and i touch him my life will not be will not remain the same amen let me hope you like that woman and tonight have come to hear from your father amen we are at a time when when humanity is being placed on each side storms of life are so hard on us hallelujah but i remember that day when the disciples were in the boat and the storms on the sea were beating the boat on all the sides but i want to thank god for the disciples knew the secret they went and woke him up and said master oh hallelujah no matter how the storms were so much the bible says that when the master woke up he just raised his hand and he said to the sick come and be still and as we are going to sing these hippo chorus i want you to to take all your eyes away to whatever storm might be in your life whatsoever thunder whatsoever trouble whatsoever tears i don't know my brother my sister whatsoever it is and i want you to focus your eyes on jesus [Music] oh i'm telling jesus i need you to wake up the storms are so hard on me i promise you my brother my sister when god's children call upon him surely he wakes up and comes the seas and comes the storm as the song has said that he paid for hallelujah hallelujah why don't you worship him in your heart just in your heart just in your heart tell him lord i love you tell him lord i thank you tell him lord you are my strength tell him lord you are my anchor tell him lord your all i need hallelujah [Music] oh we love you jesus we love you father we love you father we give you praise lord for there is no other god but you we give you all alone why don't you worship the lord at this moment worshiping don't look at the situation don't look don't look at what is around you my brother don't look at what is making you cry this evening but look at the heavenly father he is the author he is the finisher of our faith father we bless you just as i am [Music] [Music] me [Music] i'm [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] oh [Music] why don't you sing it twice are you raising your hand to him tell him lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] yes [Music] oh [Music] don't [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] god i come [Music] uh [Music] we see [Music] i [Music] oh [Music] i come just cause i am [Music] now we received [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] we know that you will always receive us [Music] and we love you too and i pray that you will be able to speak to us tonight [Music] in the name of jesus christ amen i want to greet you all in the precious name of our lord jesus christ um i would like to [Music] invite you to the word this evening we are reading proverbs 10. foreign the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and he added no sorrow with it so father we want to thank you for the blessing [Music] yesterday by god's grace i traveled to eastern uganda eastern uganda in the first quarter [Music] since last week i've been very [Music] and uh i know we i do not know if you remember i do not know if we are announced i don't remember did we announce that sister sister stella was sick is now well she's recovering yeah so we believe for her for recovering so this evening i have something on my heart that i would like to share with the church so i'd like you to uh i know on wednesday we have very short time shimano rocks so we should make every minute count category so this evening i'm speaking on the blessing of the lord the blessing of the lord now we have read in proverbs 10 2 which says the blessing of the lord it maketh rich [Music] you have some kind of echo you need to work on that now i know there are many ways we can be able to approach scripture we can approach it in many ways [Music] i believe that the holy spirit has a way that he brings the word which is the common scriptures and makes it applies it in your situation and i'm sure that uh if you have come here desiring to hear from him you will hear from him [Music] the blessing of the lord it makes rich and he adds no sorrow with it if you have it there can we read it together one more time no okay it's right here on the screen for you if you do not have it taste one everybody together the blessing of the lord it maketh rich and people think that if you have many cars you are rich and sometimes maybe even us we have fought like that sometimes these people say they are rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing here and then he says god says that they are poor they are wretched and they do not know it now of course physically speaking the people of our generation are very rich if you look at uh some of your phones you have a phone that even king david never had what to [Music] uh you know knowledge has increased and so very many new things are now uh are now here that did not used to be here orero why do we have intuitive ebitda they think they have a lot and increase with goods and have need of nothing because of the uh many material goods that they have already into every quarter cave people chase after these material goods maybe you know we don't even have time for prayer because we are chasing after the material boots sometimes people don't even come to church because they are chasing after the material goods ask them where are you when i was at work why because they are trying to find something some money so you realize that everybody almost everyone that works on the road they are looking for money [Applause] if you have a nice phone and you see someone with another phone you want to get what they have you know there is that confessions there is that spirit of love of loving the world and the things of the world to be honest if we were speaking on sunday that is walking in the flesh if we have we love the world and the things of the world then the love of god is not even in us even if you have all the world you can never be satisfied no matter how many houses you own that fast in your heart can never be quenched no matter how many clothes you own and how many closets you feel [Music] did you know that the more money you get the more money you really need [Music] these things of the world can never satisfy us all erin to the end say no to him that is why a true child of god amen will keep their eyes on jesus amen for the blessing of god what would i have known that's the blessing of god it makes you rich with the riches that will always make you happy and i would like us to look at genesis 12. [Music] here now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house and to a land that i will chose thee and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing [Music] shall all families of the ass be blessed [Music] praise the name of the lord amen now now i want you to look at somebody here come on that was a sinner like all the rest of us but he found grace and favor in the sight of the lord they have finished us from massachusetts something very good find favor and grace in the sight of the lord and when he found that faith in grace [Music] a christian and the lord never speaks to you then you need to check you need to check your christianity maybe you are not giving him enough time to speak to you oh yeah get out of your country from your people from your father's house and to the land which i will show you again and i will make you so that you can be blessed you don't need to meet rich people for you to be blessed you don't need any of that [Music] amen because when abraham met god when you hear the voice of god calling on you no blessing has to come on his way am i preaching to someone this is i want you to follow me very very attentively these words that i have on my heart every gamble you know will have an effect on your life you should connect with me so you can connect with the holy spirit amen it says i said it will have an effect on your life if only you can receive it in the right way singapore is a hungarian truth abraham ibrahim god speaks to him and tells him to go out of his father's house [Music] [Music] so that he can make our name great food near the affair today tells us to bow down to him so that he can make us a great nation at fully gwanga dinner but that is a lie oh the devil cannot make you anything satanic amen i mean you're finding our generation that we are living in oh never mind not very many people are homeless the holy spirit wants to find a place where he can rest we think we can we can mock god and get away with it you know we think he doesn't know our hearts do you realize god knows your heart more than you know yourselves that's national amen if you know amen what you believe i need your kids and if you hear the call of the lord nor will he look for you follow his leadership no community close your ears from whatever voices that come galawa you remember when abram got when he had to make a choice to go in the desert it was a bad choice it said why did amen [Music] and here abraham god abraham only to think about yourself identify yourself with it [Music] i believe i was predestinated for the blessing of the lord if you believe it can use food on your lips i am predestinated for the blessing of the lord before the foundation of the world sing against the united st [Music] the moment i want i want to demonstrate this for you very well here abram was with his father he was with his wife and he was with his cousin a lot i i i i i preached on on a person of god some time back and i dealt with that so much they were in a place called haran and you remember the father of abraham he was dreaming of a land called cannon do you know he wanted terra the father of abraham he wanted to take abram but by that time terah was with lord his um grandson and he was also with the abram and his wife garina so there was no blessing in that journey because that journey was not inspired by god it was an inspiration from and we have found out also that whatever abram did during that journey in going to canon was out of his own efforts according to the inspiration of his father god do you know many times when you make moves and movements and and steps in your life if you are not inspired by god you can never have between working in the spirit and working in the flesh [Music] but if you walk in the flesh everything you do can never have the blessing of god upon it if you are walking in the spirit whatever you are doing is to please the the lord and sisters [Music] he left the presence of the lord amen he never no longer had the blessing and so he now phoned sorrow for them the bible god himself said to him he said you will [Applause] [Music] and whatever you are doing you cannot find peace and love those who have joined us later i'm speaking on the blessing of the lord and i'm reading i read from proverbs 10 22 and right now we're reading from genesis he was a when you [Music] and you see the calling of god is usually followed with a blessing amen when you heard that when you hear that call well why would you don't quit and you respond now we know just [Music] that's why i can't understand these people who have always to break cusses from believers and these people pay a lot of money but after i mean that's why when god called abraham he said to him this way he said i will make you a great nation not a prophet or an anointed man who makes you great the blessing of god makes you great amen and he says i will bless thee the word of god already has blessed you [Applause] [Music] abraham had previously you know been living in haran but that decision was made by his father you have to change this place yeah you don't choose you have to change his dwelling place amen he had even the status quo had to change around him as long as what he was now doing was agreeing with god's vision he had to change how can a person that believes the word of god is under the blessing of god walk with them that do not believe the word of god that is why sometimes when the lord calls us and we believe his wife and we walk under the blessing of the lord for us to retain this grace upon us we have jesus change certain things in our life why do we have been traveling we are truly not true someone would have been so some covenant why do we win again we have to separate from some people when you have entered actually corinthian empire to move from haran aiming to go to canada again abraham had to separate even from his good friend and his brother and his cousin lord you would have the blessing of the lord you commando quiet talking in heaven to our channel because you are in the wrong place you have wrong friendships oh the name is one tomato which is bad and decayed and rotten in your you cannot it is thing to have the blessing of the lord to be rich to be happy but if you do what the word of god hallelujah the blessing of the lord would always follow when you make the right decision i want to show you in the scriptures lords some of you have lots that you need to break out they may not even be physical maybe certain things you love doing gps is one of the worst of its kinds [Music] i will show you by the way genesis 13. [Music] we will read from uh we might read the 13 verses out of genesis 13 so but let's see how it will go let us begin from verse 1. and abram went up out of egypt he and his wife and all that he had and a lot with him into the south again by this time the calling of the lord upon his life had given him the blessing of the lord and he had already made him rich and he went on his journeys from the south even to bethel and to the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethel and high now and under the place of the altar which he had met there at the first and there abraham called the name of the lord much foreign bible where that goes from bible when uh when eve gave birth to king cowan she said i have gotten a man from the lord from that moment she her name was changed from woman meaning a part of the man to eve mother of all living area does that mean it means was mother of both cain and abel but adam was father and when that here's what she said eve gives a distinction between the two seeds the seed of said struck a bell and the seed of cane [Music] get out not at third seed he was simply a replacement of abel's seed when seth was born that says where is his lineage the bible says i believe then men began to call upon the name of the lord [Applause] [Music] yes we have a command amen why right because that is the name of the lord [Music] in the name of jesus the devil doesn't like it from the moment jesus died and rose again hated that name they were hunting everyone who believed in it and sometimes when they arrested some disciples all over the world lord had all these riches because of his brother abram but the biggest mistake that abraham made was to keep lord around him yes the land of [Applause] and so that was the blessing overflowing [Music] and there was a strife between the hard men of abraham's cattle and the hard men of lords cattle and the canaanites and the parasite 12 10 in the land you you also have your riches the bible says that moses musa he did not esteem the riches of egypt yesterday human being with his brethren in their poverty more than the riches of egypt [Music] and whenever [Music] the word of god is house as a matter of fact we should leave rich amazing god the riches the world gives what will happen the blessing that lord gives brings its own riches lord let there be no strength i pray between me and thee and between my heart men and thy heart men for we are brothers and now [Music] then i will go to the right or without the part to the right and then i will go to the left [Applause] the blessing of the lord will be on you forever [Music] inheritance may be caught in history at the beginning but the end they wrote shall not be blessed praise the lord even as a church we are not looking for we believe that the lord has blessed us that nothing can satisfy them come out and we believe you will give us a tabernacle that is if the lord is but we don't want to give will not be blessed [Music] amen amina we know where we are standing situation as a church get cancer all these little contributions we are making [Music] [Applause] you should believe for big things my kid is your way into having any believing big things does that mean you just go and touch people's things and say claim it that is not faith if you find that woman who met elijah he told us whatever packets foreign so we can understand we have [Music] you can do that actually what am i talking about tonight i'm talking about the blessing of god god gives his blessing to those that answer the call not the way it has been told that you know you go to a man he anoints you with oil you do this you do that that's all that is an inheritance may be good and history at the beginning but the end thereof shall not be blessed 82. that poverty shall come upon him oh god i don't know let us not be quick let us not look at riches you know what jesus told my neighbor what he told it made some people to believe that all the things that god wants us to be poor so yeah i remember gonna say not necessarily seated in the church not only to those who don't have it seriously [Music] amen when he blesses you he makes you rich praise the name of the lord hallelujah i would like to request you to allow me to read you a quote he says now he gives a story of some young having this good godly parent when his daddy died when he was only 16 years old and the people took and made him king chita away we have okay you can put that for the paper as well all right um yeah a little bit up there okay and he come on the throne of power when he was only 16 years old and if you will read his life he wasn't influenced by politics of his country he didn't take the popular opinion that's what was made uh him such a good example to this young prophet at the same time together stayed at the palace and he leaned upon the arm of the king yesterday and we find out that this young fellow's influence influenced isaiah he became a hero to isaiah oh no yes what's i told you that if you walk with god god will be with you and god will bless you never give me antibiotics and god and you know some kings usually allied with other kingdoms to be blessed [Music] wonders [Music] most of the technology today is coming from israel to technology because of the blessing of the lord and then king uh the king's kingdom spread our i guess he was next to solomon in his kingdom because of his influence it reached all the way down into egypt mystery so he says it was a great help to isaiah the young prophet to see that any man that would take a stand for god and regardless of politics or anything else he would stay straight with the words [Music] god will bless you if you stay true to the world now we find that this king all did did like like so many christians of today when he got everything secure then he became lifted up in his own self and then he was on his road out now that is so it is today it's always being that when men feel that they have become sufficient that they don't have to pray anymore they don't have to wait upon god for their ministry cheering [Music] he says i agree with a certain writer that that's what has caused many of these men that has been in this latter day revivals all this last day revival to fly to pieces [Music] some of them found they've been claimed to be drunk in their pulpit and some of them has done wrong it's because that they have such an influence on the people till they begin to feel that they are self-sufficient and that their little kingdom and that they can and god people so that their grief on the people that they can just do anything they want to and the people don't notice that they drink yes i mean they drink alcohol burn your mind and they come on the pool whether this is happening they tell lies god not says it and if you want to finish up this quote i want you to take this message influence and read it where's brother marvin yeah raise up your hand that brother can print it out for you and give it to you but friends what you're talking about tonight is a very important thing hallelujah hallelujah let us stand on our feet god bless you
