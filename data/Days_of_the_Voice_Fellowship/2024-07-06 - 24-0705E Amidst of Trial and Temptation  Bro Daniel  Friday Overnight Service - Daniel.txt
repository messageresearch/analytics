and take over lord King of Kings father we thank you Lord for everything Lord Jesus we pray through your mighty name Jesus Christ amen God bless you you can sit yeah this evening I really have a short message for us it has really been corresponding with the situation I've been in through this week and when Brother Martin was singing here it was again becoming more corresponding with with the message that I want to speak about this evening amen the message today it will be Aid this the trial and temptation as we read in the scriptures uh here in Matthew chapter 18 verse 9 he said if thine eye offend thee black it out and cast it out from thee it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye rather than having two eyes to be cast into Hell Fire so it means when when when we read this scripture it means there some there are some things that will offend us that will offend our eyes that will offend not even our eyes only but other things our eyes is just standing for sensitive things in our lives there are very many sensitive things in our lives that we look at our our living um our families our church all the things that are really so close to us the eyes just standing for that but the the Bible is saying if that thing will will will make let me read again and if thine eye offend thee black it out it means that some things that are some sensitive things in life that you look at but when you see they're going to offend you or or remove or or remove you in the presence of the Lord you better cut out that thing it may be so sensitive may be so big but the Bible is saying if your eye is going to offend you pluck it out so it is really a hard moment when such a situation comes in life but God gives us Grace amen is only God's grace that keeps us moving amid such things here when we we we try to look at the difference between a a trial and a Temptation here trial is a trial is something that you are meant to overcome to succeed against the goal of a trial is to help us grow stronger and closer to our values then a Temptation a temptation is something that you are made to fail the difference in the intention of the source the difference is in the intention of the source the difference between a trial and a temptation is between the intention of the source but the Bible tells us that God does not tempt us so who tempts us the devil is tempting us and here the Bible is saying a temptation is something that you are remain to fail the devil has never wanted you to succeed in anything the devil has never been uh in support of you every time the devil is fighting Us in all corners of our lives in everything we do in our lives the devil is always fighting us but the trials that come to our lives it may it may be the same thing that the devil will use and God will use it it may may be a sickness that will come to you sometimes we may think ah why did this come but that it may be at at the same time it is a Temptation the devil is trying to make you sick that you can die but the Lord wants to manifest himself through that sickness Amen to show you that he can heal if there was no sickness there was not going to be a Healer and a Healer is only God so everything happens for good to those that love God sometimes you go through some difficult things that really no one can understand no one can explain at times you look at a person but you don't know what they're going through but it's only God who knows why that is happening we remember Jesus Christ when he was taken to the top of the temple he was told to to fall from to fall from the from the top of the temple to up to fall down to take the seat to be the king he was hungry and he was sold to change bread into he was sold to change Stone into bread that is the circumstance that everyone is saying you say I'm hungry and I really need something to eat it is what is happening to us even right now at times you're tempted the Devil comes in a way through that need that you want he comes through he comes behind that you may be lacking something to eat and through that he's going to bring another thing that will make is going to make your way to eat you may say you may steal so through that through that Temptation you may find yourself falling but everything happens for good when you lack something to eat you you run to the Lord if you're right with him you really going to run to him for help but the devil brings that so that he can fail us so that he can really compromise with our faith but he's only standing standing with the word am because here the Bible says the youth will fail we know the youth are the most the strongest when a person is in his youthful stage he feels energetic he can do anything but here the Bible is saying that going to fail you'll work and to day and night you're going to fail but until you wait upon the Lord because look at the birds look at uh different things uh in the in our universe who feeds the birds think about you look at even wild animals they they get sick and get healed who heals them sometimes it's not the game Rangers who go there and and and try to give them medication but is the creator Hallelujah is only the Creator that is responsible of Our Lives am so through the trials and The Temptations really that is a moment that fixes someone to a point where you can even not breathe you're lacking something you're thinking here and there to see a solution out but things are not meeting but it is only waiting upon the Lord calling upon the Lord we look at very many examples in the Bible everything happens for good to those that love God look at job job he was rich he was he had everything and the devil came to God and the devil told God that ah your servant is well he is Rich he has everything but God said you go you go and and and try him you go and tempt but do not don't touch his life sometimes those things that come to our lives are not coming to to destroy us but really bring out the strength of God hallelujah really bring out to see the behind part the the strength of God everything that we see it has a reason to why it is happening you canot don't know how how hunger that's before you get hungry or before you lack food but when you lack food it's when you know the importance of that food and when you're hungry but you want to eat so that is that is the the the the the Temptation the the trials that come to our lives don't we we we everyone here has a lot of Trials has a lot of things that are going through their lives everyone at each level even a young child you will be complaining he says Ah these books are disturbing me the things but you as a old person you'll say ah this kid is just here joking but at at the level of that child it is the level of the temptation all the the level of the try now like right now the the our parents you'll find him crying asking my children have no school fees have no this and this but for us we shall not understand them because we do not experience them but the moment you go through them it's when you you'll feel the burden of that thing but God tells us carry your burdens and bring them to him he will give us rest it is you carrying them you carry your burdens and take them to God yeah here also see Hanah at times things happen and you ask yourself why is this happening why is this happening you find a righteous person there some examples in church you may look at and say ah but why is this happening to this brother why is it happening to this sister and yet they are good Brothers good sisters but it is the will of God it is the will of God he has something he wants to you to understand as you see the Bible God set us examples very many examples I think no one when we reach to Heaven even on the Judgment Day no one will say ah I failed this because of this and this they will bring another human being who went through the same thing even more tougher than yours as an example to you to they will say was this one an angel or a God so that is the purpose of the triy when you the in the am this am this like we are here in the church we are in the church now think about when you on the trial amid that trial some sometimes we just think about it say I like like now the students you may say ah I have a paper next week you don't feel the pressure until that day until that day comes it's when you'll feel how how the how pressure is so that's the trial but what are you going to do am that trial what are you going to do when you're in that trial here brother Bram tells us in a message Israel and the church When Trials around you gather breathe that holy name in prayer Devils will scatter like rles on a flow from the lights from the light is turned on breathe that name in prayer Pray even if you don't feel it pray because prayer it is the only weapon that we have that God gave us but we do not use that weapon we claim to be soldiers of the Cross but when we are told to go to the battlefield then you say ah for me I will not manage yet you call yourself a a soldier of the Cross so in those trials in it's when you you really face the real thing sometimes we just talk about them sometimes we just talk when someone says Ah I lost my dad I lost my mom you may not feel it but the time you you go through it it's when you will feel the burden but what do you do what do you do in that circumstance is only leaning upon God Hallelujah the devil has tried so much but when we stand on the Lord I know you will not forsake us we see a lot of examples sadrach M and is the fire when they were told you going to be burned the most part I like about that verse is saying if God has not come to save us let me die we shall die what brings that in our hearts being con conviced and concerned you have to be conviced and concerned of what you're holding it's why you're going to get the Zeal of pressing on you cannot press on for something that will has no value it can never happen can you press on for AA without anything just a black Vera there but if there's something so precious you're going to even fall down and stand and do everything that you can take that thing if you to take it if there's a million dollar like a like 1 million like ugan Shillings you'll Fight Hard see we have been there to the store of loading some books I was looking at men of loading books because of money the exchange of that the thing that you're going You're exchanging your energy with the money because the they correspond do you think God being born of a human do you think he just he wanted to be in that scheme of coming to die and suffer there's something precious that he was trying to redeem Hallelujah something precious you may not understand how precious you are to God right now you may not see it right now but when you pressing the bible promises us there's a law that God has prepared for us that our eyes have not seen our ears have not heard the trials will go through sometimes are very heavy but think of of what you fighting for what convinced you really to to follow this this path there's something you ought to fight for there's something everyone also fight for we see Joshua when God told them that you're going to take this land they fought for each step that they are going to take that's when you you know the value of what you're fighting for that's when you'll see your trial and tempation as something so small to what you're looking at you have to be convinced and concerned of your destination we're not just here to live and die but there's something that we we we are looking at right now but that thing you just have to be convinced what convinced you to be a Christian what convinced you to go through all these trials because here the Bible says in uh here in uh Peter the Bible tells us in First Peter 1 verse 6- 9 we can read there 1 Peter chapter 1 verse verse 6 it says wherein thy greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manold Temptations the try that that that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perishes amen though it be tried with fire may it be founded on two May might be might be found onto praise and honor and glory to the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen ye love in whom whom though now you see him not he believe him you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory our faith is tried more than the gold tried in fire how many have ever been burnt like burnt with fire I think everyone knows the pain when fire burns you now the Bible is telling us our faith is more precious than gold tried in fire so why aren't you concerned of what you you looking at of what you you're Desiring of what is bringing you always here we should always be concerned we not just here just in a honeymoon or in just wasting time here think of your precious time the Bible says in Revelations that in the last days in this laian age that we are we are hot and cold why waste your time brother Bram tells us that you should if you are to be a like if you to to be like uh to do to be a sinner be the best do everything for me I I at times I look at things I say if I was going to do that thing I'll do it with passion I'll do it and say I did it but then why do you mix things you're losing out one when you try to bring out this and this you're losing out one at least take one do it the best if you serve God serve him with all your heart with everything in you with all that is in you amen if you are to be a sinner do it do it the best not just being there because you all you're going to waste your time because you're not going to enjoy the side very well and yet you're going again to hell at least do your B in one of those if you to be a sin be that real Sina that they will say ah this one yeah he knows how to do it Hallelujah yeah do it with passion if you serve God serve him with passion amen hallu here brother bam says uh in uh in the message Divine Healing let's have the rough way to I must fight if I must reain I must get some of the rough Parts I want to take off that helmet of salvation lay it on the bank stick the the old sword of the word here back in the the the shelf of Eternity and scream to the top of my voice father push out a Lifeboat I'm coming over home this morning I believe he will be there to meet me that's right that's my faith that builds on nothing less than Jesus's blood and righteousness and all around my soul gives way is all my trust and stay for on Jesus the so rock we stand all other grounds seeking son sir if you must reain if you no it says if you must fight you must if you have you if you must Reign you have to fight even the kingdom of God it is not a walk over it is not a walk over we look at people that lost their lives at times we sing here songs without knowing the meanings of them a plag Allegiance those people were just like making a no like you you in the court and you you you're making a no you're saying I this and this and this those people we are making it I pledge allegiancy amen when I think of that I really feel we need to fight for what we we we are looking at we need to press soon I this everything if it is to serve god let's Ser God with all our hearts at times the Devil Comes [Music] really coming to distract us fully but it's only the grace of God that he promised us that he will always give us a MST every Temptation and trial that we shall overcome it is not by our Mighty is not that we have a lot of tactics that we know a lot of tax tactics of fighting the devil but is the grace of God am that he has always given us amen look at job's story when I I was reading this job's story it was really hard it was really hard for job job had everything he had everything but the devil came and took almost everything they children his livestock his everything and we're also going through some things at times we lose out the big the things that we at times like jobs you will go to a job and the job will make you compromise with God but you'll just leave it you leave the money is a painful thing for everyone because we need the money but what makes you leave it it means there's something worth it look at Job his wife came and told him can't you cast God and die and job asked the wife why why do you talk like a fool because he knew what he was holding knowing what you're holding amidst the Temptation it will make it so little for you to go through because you know what you're holding you know what you're holding even in life we have losers in life that will make you demoralize will try to bring the the negative side looking at your situation they'll see H you're a failure you this and this there were three men who came to job giving him advice do this and this so job when he started thinking about it he saw things were really tough and he started complaining to God say why this why this and this because of the people that we listen to in some of the things we go through find ourselves going astray job went astray and sometimes you also go astray because of the people because of the words of people you'll do something because of peer pressure say ah someone is looking at me someone will say this and this but job went astray but there was young man called elu when he came to job he found those men there there he said you may be old in age but I've come to tell you this and this he rebuked them of what they were telling job El in the uh the Bible means a representative of God am the representative of God is the holy spirit his word it will represent him in all our situations all that we go through El who stood and when he was speaking job CAU the Revelation CAU a vision he said I know my redeemer liveth Hallelujah when those people come to discourage you our friends discourage us they look at us and say you cannot do this and this but just tell them I know my redeemer liveth that's what helped job and repented to God so it does not even it gives us an example even the ones that you see as strong the strong Christians they also cry they also feel the pain even Jesus Christ cried the pain was too much even the things we are going through they bring that pain and if you decide to take one path if something becomes more valuable to you it may either bring life or death to you that's what we are all about in life here so at times tell the devil that is not th but tell him that is not my portion through that that's how we keep on overcoming day by day day by day you you come and you meet something so so big but you go through it even tomorrow like that in job 14:1 it says a man born of a human is a few days and full of trouble so you cannot avoid the troubles in life but what do you do do you just obey them but we have a redeemer Jesus Christ even when things are so tough for times I reach at a point where I feel like let let me let me let me just leave everything to because I my heart always tells me that there's God who can redeem you who can help you I just hold on that even if I I I don't see any result I hold on that I find myself going through that and again something else comes again you hold on that you hold on that you find yourself going through but what brings that being co convinced and concerned it's what helps us to really keep on moving convin about your destination and concerned where am I going the only two places that we are going to after here is hell and heaven so you have to be concerned where am I going but you you are you you are you do your Deeds the ones that will really bring out what you where you will go let's read this quote here brother Bram says and uh Redemption by judgment then brother something is going on is going to take place CU you have got a real foundation for God will not wise cast you out Temptations come there will never be a Temptation unless unless he gives you Grace to Bear it amen and he his promised to meet you on every Battlefront right there and stand in your place so then that's where your hope is at is at you get to the place you say well brother Bill they I have so many Temptations tell me one Christian that does not have Temptation we never come to a picnic we we we've come to a Battle Ground we are out here to fight the enemy why sure we do not put on our armor just to be looked at if you become a Christian just to be looked at then you are yeah why am I afraid you got in the wrong place Christian sometimes is looked down upon or made fun of but we come as Warrior amen and sprinkled in the blood the old ragged cross going before us the Morning Star lighting up the way why we are on our road on our road somewhere every Christian you look at our pastor our deacons our trustees our elders here all go through Temptations everyone here goes through Temptations but then through that Temptation you will decide where to go what is in you will take one side so we should always pray God to help us make a stand amidst everything you you press everything comes with a Temptation comes with a trial love comes with a trial faith comes with a trial Our Hope comes with a trial everything comes with a trial but it is you to make out something good through that because Trials come to as we read the purpose of a the purpose of a trial the trial the goal of a trial is to help us grow strong and close to our values what is your value that is what will make you grow stronger to eat even amid is everything amid is the opposition what is your values at times we have to do all we can to flee everything every Temptation every everything we have like Joseph when faroh's wife came to him Joseph do you know what he did if Leah way sometimes you have to run for your life you have to run to to do an action is not just speaking words to do some actions about the evil as you have had here if your eye makes you offending remove it if you you look at something so obscene turn your head until you reach where you're going don't look back on it at times you have to run for your life Joseph rain you also have to run all those are examples no one will give an excuse in heaven no one people have done a lot to to really see they can make that destination making their calling sure they done everything people do you not risking yourself they they're telling you they're going to to put you in fire they're going to throw in the den of lions ah then you you put on a test you say something heavy but in everything you have to know your values to know everything hallelujah amen we should always know where we are falling Joseph had to run away we should also run sometimes you have to really run run sometimes you have to behave crazy even to the world they will say this man maybe he has something he has a problem some things we take them lightly and by the time you understand ah you cannot even overcome it if Joseph had remained there maybe he would sin our bodies are not changed our bodies are not baptized with the Holy Spirit our bodies are still tempted even up to now our our bodies get angry our bodies even we get angry about people but what does the Bible say I is all those things you may have a lot of reasons to to satisfy what you're going through but what does the word of God say amid is that trial amid is that thing that is very heavy for you you just have to know the values of what you you're fighting for just have to keep racing on amid is everything you have to press on because trials groom out a character that's why you see you sometimes you look at people like Let me Give an example like is not good everyone to grow up poor but some poor people most of them they're different you know why they go through a lot they will respect people because they know if you don't respect someone you may not get something you'll know the value of that thing but is not the guarantee that every poor person is is a has a good character but some things tough things come to our lives just bring out that good thing in you because you'll not know it before you go through it that's why I have given an example poor people most of them are well behaved because they know they value things if this food are going to Value it if it is money they're going to Value it because they know they sweated for it like that young man who was the dad told him I don't remember well the story but when the dad told him to he was going to work to get some money he told him to bring money he used to then the mom used to give him money and Rings to the dad and the dad will throw it in Fire and again the the boy goes back he says go and and do this then the boy again goes and to the mom he says oh you get some money from somewhere he again brings it to the dad the Dad throws it again in the fire but when he went and worked for the money H when the dad was about to throw the money in the fire the boy jumped save his money because he knows the value of that so we should we should not just live a life live and die you know your value you know what you're looking for you know what we were created for even am this great trials a it's everything we should have to make a stand you cannot stop birds from coming to a tree but you can stop them from building a nest there trials will always come that is that you cannot remove that but if you leave them to build a nest there they will become something heavy for you but even when they come see something good through them see some life through them Hallelujah here as we read about El when he came to job here brother Bram says in a message Israel and the church so in the distress a righteous man go dealing with a sa he sent a man by the name of elu and elu did not accuse him only over choosing God but El told him said now job you have watched all these things he said now there is there is coming a just one who is going to stand in the Bleach between a sinful man and a holy God and then that man that they will go to the Grave to M for and you you you you perceive you perceive it not then will he rise then when job heard that he stood on his feet my the lightning flashed the Thunders rolled what was it the prophet got back into the channel of God again by his eyes by by by his eyes come open he said I know my redeemer liveth when we are going through hard hard things when you see even a brother going through some hard things try to confort them at times they may they may not be that good through the trials but confort them don't rebuke them so much at times you may think someone is going through something because maybe he's a sinner times those things just come to prove that God is our provider God is our everything in all the situation we are going through but at times when we look at people going through some difficult situations you say that person is a sinner that's why God is punishing him instead of conforting a brother confort a sister don't always rebuke them at times confort them and say no don't look at yourself sometimes you they look at themselves as as great Sinners as if the ones that have done a lot of sins but when you convert a brother at times that word will save your brother at times even bad things happen in life just to be an example to us Samson failed very many times he he disobeyed God but at the at at the the last moment God remembered him he did not give up at times we we should also not give up on our brothers even when they they they annoy sweeten that anger with prayer and love when you love someone they will they will they will look at you as something as someone so different even when they are doing bad to you so amidst all those things amidst the troubles you go through it has upon God because he says those that wait upon thee because he says those that wait upon the Lord he shall renew their strength they shall Mount their wings like eagles they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint amen those that wait up on the Lord not those that wait upon man at times even we get we get angry over our brothers when he says please I cannot help you in this because you not know the reasons why they're not helping you you just get angry say that brother you cannot even help me but the Bible is telling us we should wait upon the Lord he may not use that person and he uses the other person to help you because you waited upon the Lord not waiting upon man Hallelujah yeah we should be serious of what we we are holding I mean it's everything because trials are going to come to test you whether you you're stable they will come and Shake you to see how how strong are you and what you you claim to be then your true characters are going to come come out if you're a genuine believer your characters are going to come out but if you're there there I don't know so everyone has a battle to fight here brother bam says in the message in a message acts of the Holy Spirit he says times may be hard God has not promised a flly bed of e but he has promised Grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you that's right yes indeed grace is sufficient not he is on a flower flower flowerly bed of his but he promise great CH overcome in every Temptation when a cross gets heavy Christ promis to be with you it is not a flly bed of his being a Christian is really not a joking subject because even what you're going to to to get it will be worth it Jesus Christ died for us at the cross he shed his blood because we're worth that but when we do not look at that and we look at other things I don't know here we see God was telling Joshua to be of good courage even in everything we go through at least keep encouraging your yourself ah one day one day I will make it one day I will overcome this don't make yourself say I'm a loser failed here and here say what I will make it come at me I know I will make it you have to just make that confirm it to yourself that I will make it because everything has the beginning and the end even our pains and sufferings have begins and and the end everything has a beginning and the end so we should always pray soon pray on every day every hour and we shall overcome at times as I'm concluding I always have I always have something that I always requested God to always do for me among my siblings my my elders left the message we all born in the message but as I was also growing I use ask good one thing I want to be an example to my master help everyone Lord King of Kings father to lean upon thee Lord help everyone Lord Jesus king of kings father really know you more and more
