[1:22:21] that was a big proclamation
[1:22:28] amen i mean
[1:22:30] let us continue doing that
[1:22:34] this morning i'm speaking on the

[1:23:04] yom
[1:23:18] and so this morning
[1:23:21] i believe that
[1:23:22] we shall have a wonderful time too
[1:23:28] hey man i mean
[1:23:32] this book
[1:23:33] the scripture we have read in colossians
[1:23:38] and actually incidentally by the poly
[1:23:41] cup and crushed into a little bit of
[1:23:42] what i was going to speak this morning
[1:23:44] and i was impressed
[1:23:46] with
[1:23:58] [Music]
[1:24:10] so we notice here in colossians our
[1:24:14] support speaks
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:25:01] [Applause]
[1:25:12] [Music]
[1:25:25] made it manifest for his saints
[1:25:31] and to whom the saints
[1:25:34] god has made to them known
[1:25:38] what is the richest of the glory of them
[1:25:42] of this mystery
[1:25:49] so there is something about this mystery
[1:25:57] [Music]
[1:26:08] and it is glorious
[1:26:17] we are right here
[1:26:18] i'm speaking to you
[1:26:20] he says it is rich and glorious
[1:26:24] and then he says what is this mystery
[1:26:26] because
[1:26:27] a german chino church this is christ in
[1:26:30] you
[1:26:32] know
[1:26:34] the hope
[1:27:27] that is vindicated in your life
[1:27:44] receiving the authority which adam lost
[1:27:50] that's the vindication
[1:27:54] if you have received a revelation of who
[1:27:57] you are
[1:28:13] book it and move forward
[1:28:16] and move forward now you'll get an
[1:28:17] argument you don't cry over something
[1:28:21] that you believe
[1:28:25] and where is the word
[1:28:55] of the ma of the messenger of malachi 4.
[1:29:04] sometimes we think that that message is
[1:29:06] restoring us only back to pentecost
[1:29:15] the message is restoring
[1:29:17] pentacles yes
[1:29:20] but it is also passing pentecost
[1:29:50] that
[1:30:32] hallelujah
[1:30:55] and christ
[1:30:56] if and he says and if christ be in you
[1:31:00] romans 8 10.
[1:31:07] the body is dead because of sin
[1:31:12] and the spirit is life because of
[1:31:13] righteousness
[1:31:33] hallelujah amen remember this is a
[1:31:35] glorious mystery
[1:31:39] if that same spirit dwell in you oh
[1:31:54] [Music]
[1:32:23] there is something secretly happening
[1:32:26] whatever the way it creates your mention
[1:32:27] in the mind i am being quickened every
[1:32:29] day
[1:32:32] every time what is she saying
[1:32:34] one of these days
[1:32:36] is
[1:32:52] the people
[1:33:06] spirit
[1:34:02] why right because adam was the life of
[1:34:05] his life
[1:34:07] the spirit of god was in heaven
[1:34:11] adam was in the image of god adam it's
[1:34:13] funny
[1:34:14] adam was a manifestation
[1:34:59] miami gustota submitted himself to
[1:35:01] others
[1:35:03] every animal in this world
[1:35:07] every creature
[1:35:11] everything that you see
[1:35:12] anymore that was created by god and he
[1:35:15] had to understand he was submitting
[1:35:17] himself to us
[1:35:19] why because adam was the king of the
[1:35:21] eyes
[1:35:23] adam was the god of the academy
[1:37:31] god is trying to push his own even those
[1:37:34] who are of his seed to go back into that
[1:37:37] atmosphere
[1:37:45] even when we are in the church like this
[1:38:02] you find them thinking about something
[1:38:03] else
[1:38:09] but when i got the chat
[1:38:11] because i want to cooperate with the
[1:38:13] holidays
[1:38:18] [Music]
[1:38:29] [Music]
[1:39:36] why right because of that
[1:39:38] atmosphere remaining you because of that
[1:39:41] nature
[1:39:42] and then he speaks now you get up
[1:39:45] hallelujah amen he was a man german too
[1:39:49] that's why he spoke to kill them
[1:39:52] but
[1:40:06] because whatever you speak commander
[1:40:08] should not show you together write that
[1:40:09] mercy
[1:40:11] you have that authority but you know we
[1:40:13] use your word it happens
[1:40:16] we must come to that realization
[1:40:20] we must
[1:40:47] is
[1:41:16] there will be
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:43] [Music]
[1:41:58] it takes you out
[1:42:13] get the contemporary on honor that's
[1:42:14] when the devil has power to tell you you
[1:42:16] can't even pray because god will not
[1:42:18] hear you
[1:42:22] because he knows
[1:42:24] you have come out of your place your
[1:42:25] voodom is fortunate
[1:42:27] [Music]
[1:42:38] and he tells me to say young
[1:42:42] [Music]
[1:42:48] and we shall come to that crimson stream
[1:42:50] of blood i will treat you too cow
[1:42:52] therefore the lord god sent him from the
[1:42:54] garden of eden
[1:43:19] [Music]
[1:43:22] where did he come from
[1:43:25] he came from god javed
[1:43:29] but when adam

[2:27:02] gamba
[2:27:03] for those who are living
[2:27:05] [Music]
[2:27:09] can you feed it to all yeah good man
[2:27:13] according to the flesh
[2:27:18] [Music]
[2:27:40] set their minds on the things of the
[2:27:42] spirit in the world
[2:27:56] now
[2:27:57] the mind of the flesh is best
[2:28:00] in the world
[2:28:03] both now and forever because it pursues
[2:28:06] sin
[2:28:10] in the world
[2:28:22] the spiritual meaning the spiritual
[2:28:25] well-being that comes from working with
[2:28:28] god
[2:28:32] [Music]
[2:28:37] but now
[2:28:38] what
[2:28:50] [Music]
[2:28:53] sinful pursuits
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:58] he is actively hostile to god
[2:29:03] and there was a movie
[2:29:05] never
[2:29:11] it does not submit itself to god's law
[2:29:15] since it cannot be
[2:29:18] gone
[2:29:24] and those who are in the flesh
[2:29:28] living a life that caters to sinful
[2:29:31] appetites and impulses
[2:29:50] you are not living in the flesh
[2:29:55] i am not in the flesh this is a silly
[2:29:57] movie
[2:30:00] controlled by sinful nature oh
[2:30:17] if in fact the spirit of god lives in
[2:30:20] you amazing
[2:30:24] directing you and guiding you
[2:30:28] the spirit of god directs and guides
[2:30:40] does not have the spirit of christ he
[2:30:43] does not belong to him and he is not a
[2:30:46] child of god oh my god
[2:30:52] [Music]
[2:30:57] and if christ lives in you
[2:31:00] era
[2:31:03] though your natural body is dead because
[2:31:06] of sin yet
[2:31:08] on the water
[2:31:10] your spirit is alive omaha
[2:31:33] christ jesus from the dead will also
[2:31:35] give life to your mother bodies through
[2:31:37] your spirit
[2:32:08] and our sinful capacity oh

[2:33:09] of having a girlfriend a boyfriend oh no

[2:33:16] gospel we have no capacity of big things
[2:33:27] now
[2:33:34] to live according to the impulses of the
[2:33:36] flesh
[2:33:43] our nature
[2:33:45] without the holy spirit that could be
[2:33:48] common
[2:33:52] for if we you i are living according to
[2:33:56] the impulses of the flesh
[2:34:00] no way
[2:34:10] [Music]
[2:34:13] when you're still living here because
[2:34:15] you have a name that you live but you're
[2:34:16] dead
[2:34:25] each of us has the capacity to live
[2:34:27] according to the nature of the flesh
[2:34:54] but if you are living
[2:34:57] by the power of the holy spirit
[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:04] you are habitually put into death the
[2:35:07] sinful deeds of the body
[2:35:24] hey
[2:35:39] hungry
[2:35:41] for all
[2:35:42] who are allowing themselves to be led by
[2:35:44] the spirit of god
[2:35:51] they are the sons of god
[2:36:01] you have not received the spirit of
[2:36:03] slavery leading against the fear of
[2:36:06] god's judgment
