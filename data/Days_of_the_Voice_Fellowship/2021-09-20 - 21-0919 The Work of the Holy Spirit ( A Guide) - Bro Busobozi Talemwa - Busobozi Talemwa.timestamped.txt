[53:20] we went to that brother
[53:23] brother uh
[53:25] joel
[53:40] in a team that that went to che guevara
[53:44] again
[53:45] and we had i tell you we had a wonderful
[53:48] time there babu leader 2016 and
[53:51] i should say that the church
[53:54] there is now strong iraq amber
[53:56] government
[54:00] the pastor there was formerly from the
[54:03] pentecostals
[54:07] and is a man who loves god sergio aguero
[54:09] catherine and uh we also held a crusade
[54:13] trillionaire
[54:15] they were meeting at a tree under a tree
[54:19] and
[54:20] [Applause]
[54:21] we went and evangelized around the area
[54:24] chicken and it took he didn't get him a
[54:25] cartoon i don't remember how many people
[54:27] do we baptize i go to others
[54:31] about ten someone said to me about ten
[54:33] between five and ten yes so i don't
[54:35] remember the number
[54:48] but i think we need to
[54:50] stand with them because now they need to
[54:51] do their church construction
[54:59] donated
[55:19] he donated land yeah
[55:22] and uh this land was his but he donated
[55:25] it to the church
[55:29] and so uh ever since
[55:32] they are believing the lord to provide
[55:34] for the construction of the church
[55:38] and there has not been a message in that
[55:40] area
[55:42] i would like us to remember that so we
[55:44] can be able to stand with them in prayer
[55:46] and also
[56:00] i would like um to say brother joel i
[56:02] don't know if you have sorted it out i'd
[56:03] like to have pastor mugisa
[56:06] for you to greet us
[56:13] brother you would have to unmute i think
[56:15] you can use the micro the camera sound
[56:17] the camera sound can be able to the
[56:19] camera audio can be able to do that
[56:22] so you can greet us
[56:25] and then by the joel you'll be
[56:26] interpreting for him
[56:28] to english
[56:39] i think i think you would need to mute
[56:41] to first remove the audio your source of
[56:44] the
[56:45] speaker so that it doesn't give an echo
[56:52] can you try now
[56:58] [Music]
[57:00] you can see him you just have to do it
[57:02] on youtube

[57:16] yes we can now hear you go ahead
[57:27] there is an echo i don't know
[57:29] can you mute your speaker can you mute
[57:31] your speaker
[57:33] can you first remove the speaker
[57:41] okay can you speak now okay can you
[57:43] speak now
[57:46] oh my god

[59:46] they were here on youtube because we do
[59:48] not have a bigger speaker here

[1:00:14] you know we do not know when the rapture
[1:00:16] is happening
[1:00:17] [Music]
[1:00:19] we don't want to look at our situation
[1:00:20] now or our condition and say we cannot
[1:00:22] do anything for the lord
[1:00:26] i mean
[1:00:41] amen amen we don't believe in just
[1:00:44] sitting back and letting others do
[1:00:45] something
[1:00:48] whether you are small
[1:00:51] you are big
[1:00:52] do something for the lord
[1:00:54] whether we are two hundred over two db
[1:00:56] for just ten over coming whether we are
[1:00:59] one family or two families over family
[1:01:00] remember let's do something for the lord
[1:01:04] let us not say when i grow up i will
[1:01:05] serve the lord program until nicolas
[1:01:08] when our church
[1:01:20] amen amen we are not building our
[1:01:22] kingdom
[1:01:33] so you may need to
[1:01:39] so i would like to
[1:01:41] tell you what happened yesterday
[1:01:46] uh we had a wonderful meeting
[1:01:50] i see that some of you are not a part of
[1:01:52] that meeting
[1:01:55] because that you were caught up like dr
[1:01:58] peter you wrote back and told me that
[1:02:00] you were caught up at work
[1:02:05] i'd like to appreciate you for doing
[1:02:07] that wherever you could
[1:02:09] to let us know you are with us and
[1:02:11] no matter what is going on
[1:02:15] um
[1:02:19] we we
[1:02:20] we had several people come over and we
[1:02:22] were a total of 19 people who attended
[1:02:25] trabajan two hours
[1:02:28] and most of them were young people
[1:02:47] but the bible says the bibliogram is
[1:02:49] despised
[1:02:52] small beginnings
[1:02:55] so we therefore believe that it's just
[1:02:57] the beginning
[1:03:00] if the lord
[1:03:24] the program for our church construction
[1:03:27] has started in texas
[1:03:31] and just started in a very very strong
[1:03:34] way attending attendance
[1:03:37] uh
[1:03:38] with young people navajo
[1:03:40] pledging to do all they can
[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:50] we had even a young child i think the
[1:03:53] youngest that was able to play something
[1:03:55] was
[1:03:57] a five five year old
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:06] and she pledged 1 000 every month
[1:04:09] [Music]
[1:04:19] [Music]
[1:04:25] get food tomorrow
[1:04:28] no one forced her
[1:04:29] to ready but she pledged by herself
[1:04:33] one thousand children sitting
[1:04:36] every month
[1:04:38] towards
[1:04:52] i think should be about 15 13 12.
[1:04:57] 11
[1:04:58] 12 11 12
[1:05:01] and she has been having her books
[1:05:04] he has been uh putting her savings there
[1:05:08] come over here
[1:05:09] but she
[1:05:11] decided
[1:05:12] when she had on what what was going on
[1:05:17] she decided
[1:05:18] that she would break that box
[1:05:28] [Music]
[1:05:33] she gave away everything she has yeah
[1:05:35] what day have you never had enough
[1:05:36] everything

[1:16:00] project run so fast

[1:16:37] all right i believe everybody is there
[1:16:39] exactly
[1:16:40] to say yo
[1:16:43] the name of jesus
[1:16:46] christ
[1:16:47] when he the spirit of truth is calm
[1:16:50] he will guide you into all truth for he
[1:16:53] shall not speak of his of himself but
[1:16:55] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:16:58] speak and he will show you things to
[1:17:00] come
[1:17:03] in
[1:17:25] amen i mean
[1:17:26] god bless you you may have your seats
[1:17:28] come along
[1:17:33] let's speak to him a moment
[1:17:36] jesus
[1:17:37] we consecrate ourselves to you this
[1:17:39] moment
[1:17:42] father i am nothing without you that has
[1:17:45] a signature in the water my brothers are
[1:17:47] nothing without you
[1:17:49] and my sisters also never engineers them
[1:17:51] coming lord they cannot be able to know
[1:17:53] what it is that you are saying unless
[1:17:55] you revealed it to them come
[1:18:29] this morning i'm speaking i'm continuing
[1:18:32] on our subject we have had on the work
[1:18:34] of the holy spirit
[1:18:42] and my subject this morning will be a
[1:18:45] guide
[1:18:54] the first two or three services on this
[1:18:56] topic of the work of the holy spirit i
[1:18:58] spoke on
[1:19:00] training of a child
[1:19:07] now you may realize that training a
[1:19:09] child some of you may think well what
[1:19:11] does it have to do with the holy spirit
[1:19:17] and you will notice that actually a
[1:19:19] parent
[1:19:20] a parent physically speaking represents
[1:19:23] god
[1:19:24] in the life of a child
[1:19:30] [Music]
[1:19:32] and respecting your father and your
[1:19:34] mother is the first
[1:19:36] commandment with promise
[1:19:42] okay
[1:19:46] that if you respect your parents you are
[1:19:48] going to receive blessings in it
[1:19:53] you are going to live long
[1:19:56] and you will not suffer
[1:19:59] many people actually physically suffer
[1:20:02] because they do not respect
[1:20:17] represent the holy spirit in a childish
[1:20:19] life
[1:20:23] when the child's ability to exercise
[1:20:26] their free moral agency has not matured
[1:20:29] well the parent is there
[1:20:44] is there to
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:19] [Applause]
[1:21:32] and now we notice that a parent only
[1:21:35] even nurtures his child until only a
[1:21:37] certain time in life
[1:22:08] every one
[1:22:36] at one point in your life to sow
[1:22:38] spiritual seeds in your life
[1:22:46] but then come the time
[1:22:48] to say that you have outgrown their
[1:22:50] leadership and you have outgrown their
[1:22:53] control over your life
[1:23:00] and you reach a time whereby you are now
[1:23:02] going to exercise your own spiritual
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:30] he was independent
[1:23:46] i want
[1:24:01] hallelujah amen then we shall not have
[1:24:03] so much trouble in the churches
[1:24:06] mechanisms i don't even have so much
[1:24:08] trouble on the pulpit
[1:24:11] that's why i'm saying that no man has a
[1:24:13] right to stand on the pulpit to preach
[1:24:15] the gospel before they are baptized into
[1:24:17] the holocaust
[1:24:24] because they still need to sit and beat
[1:24:26] up
[1:24:54] sometimes we can make notes of 10 pages
[1:24:56] five pages six pages
[1:25:02] and when i come on the pulpit i only
[1:25:03] cover a quarter of the first page
[1:25:10] what is it
[1:25:25] we have been studying it in the
[1:25:27] weekly bible studies
[1:25:33] and we have really been blessed hey
[1:25:34] that's where they doing the young people
[1:25:36] have been blessed
[1:25:38] all the meetings are on youtube
[1:25:41] and go through the phone
[1:25:43] every meeting is like three hours
[1:25:49] but while we are studying that book
[1:25:52] you see something was written in there
[1:25:53] one way i wanted one and he said
[1:25:56] that there are two identifications of
[1:25:58] the true church
[1:26:03] in every generation
[1:26:05] that is the first church
[1:26:18] it will always have the true word of god
[1:26:24] will also have the manifestation of the
[1:26:26] power of the holy ghost
[1:26:31] just talk about the holy ghost
[1:26:34] there will be manifestations
[1:27:20] [Applause]
[1:27:58] the thing
[1:28:12] and how can they be guided by the holy
[1:28:14] ghost when they don't have evidence
[1:28:20] god keeps his word in the brain
[1:28:24] he looked at me a little bit and said
[1:28:26] again
[1:28:39] god sent the holy ghost to lead the
[1:28:42] church
[1:28:48] now of course we have pastors
[1:28:51] we have a minister to another awareness
[1:28:53] and the prophet says that the pastor is
[1:28:55] the highest
[1:28:57] authority in the church
[1:29:04] how does he exercise that authority
[1:29:08] i'm
[1:30:48] [Applause]
[1:31:02] [Music]
[1:31:32] everybody make sure you mute your sound
[1:31:36] right so when sometimes you come to a
[1:31:38] meeting like this they said
[1:31:40] service again some people you know we
[1:31:42] just want to have a we don't want to
[1:31:44] have a good meal
[1:31:48] just want to have a snack
[1:31:52] for a real good meal today
[1:32:08] just make present yourself as if you're
[1:32:11] going to interpret for the whole day yes
[1:32:13] i mean
[1:32:14] hallelujah amen don't worry i'll not
[1:32:16] take you for the whole day
[1:32:17] just a few minutes amen probably 60 or
[1:32:20] so but i wanted to yield your time
[1:32:24] so you see that the holy ghost will
[1:32:25] teach the word of god again
[1:32:30] and he will stay with the word eras
[1:32:33] of things to come
[1:32:36] what does the holy ghost do
