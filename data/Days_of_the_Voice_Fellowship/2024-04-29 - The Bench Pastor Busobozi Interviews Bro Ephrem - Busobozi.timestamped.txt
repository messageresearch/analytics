[7:42] hello uh our viewers today greetings in
[7:45] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[7:47] welcome once again to the bench with
[7:50] pastori uh pastori here once again
[7:53] speaking to you from our program it's
[7:58] been a while uh uh without having uh a
[8:02] guest on the bench uh but by God's grace
[8:06] we've got somebody here to talk with
[8:08] today and I believe that our
[8:10] conversation will be a blessing to many
[8:13] young ministers as well as many young
[8:17] people to just Inspire them and even
[8:19] older ones alike just Inspire them to to
[8:22] for for us to know that God is still God
[8:25] is the same yesterday today and forever
[8:27] he still doing his works uh he's still
[8:30] calling he still sending many into the
[8:33] mission Fields until the last one comes
[8:35] in the scripture in the Book of Matthew
[8:38] 24
[8:40] says verse 14 and this Gospel of the
[8:43] Kingdom shall be preached in all the
[8:46] world for a witness unto all nations and
[8:50] then shall the End come so and to the
[8:54] uttermost parts of the Earth this gospel
[8:56] will go up to the uttermost parts of the
[8:59] earth now we know the Bible speaks of uh
[9:02] the woman the queen of Shiba and we know
[9:05] that she was the queen of Ethiopia and
[9:08] she was coming from the uttermost parts
[9:10] of the earth to go in Jerusalem and see
[9:12] the wisdom and hear the wisdom of
[9:14] Solomon and so today we have someone
[9:17] from the land of Ethiopia our brother
[9:20] Ephraim uh Abdu Dango and so we would
[9:24] like to greet you brother brother
[9:25] Ephraim God bless you maybe if you could
[9:28] just take a moment and with the
[9:30] viewers uh that'll be wonderful God
[9:34] bless everyone uh my name is brother
[9:37] Ephraim I came from uh Ethiopia uh doing
[9:40] a ministerial work there may God bless
[9:43] all the viewers and all the people that
[9:45] are here amen so uh we've had many
[9:49] people on the bench here we we've had
[9:51] pastors we've had businessmen we've had
[9:54] elders and so and even younger ones as
[9:57] well but we've not had had uh uh someone
[10:02] like you a a a young man but also a real
[10:06] dedicated gospel Minister and so before
[10:10] we get into your ministry and what the
[10:12] Lord is uh doing through your life and
[10:15] your ministry let's go back to the
[10:18] beginning uh maybe to just ask you cuz I
[10:20] see your is it your called your middle
[10:23] name is Abdu that is a Muslim name how
[10:26] did you get that
[10:27] name well
[10:30] uh from the beginning my my father was a
[10:34] Muslim M he started his journey uh with
[10:39] a Muslim family and his father is known
[10:43] in the southern part of the Ethiopian
[10:46] nation which is called s okay so he
[10:51] introduced the the the market of coffee
[10:55] the market of perfume and the market of
[10:59] seeds plant seeds in uh in SEL and he
[11:03] start to import them to to the capital
[11:05] city of Adisa that's how he's known all
[11:08] over but the main part of the impact
[11:12] will be on religious he's a very
[11:15] religious man dedicated man so my father
[11:19] will grow up under him uh in the
[11:23] religious way the same way that he
[11:25] handled it so my father grew up holding
[11:28] the the the the Muslim religion very
[11:32] seriously yes uh are you aware of the
[11:37] beginnings of his conversion and how he
[11:39] converted from Islam to the Christian
[11:41] faith yes so as he was he was doing his
[11:46] Masters there there are some white
[11:49] people Baptist white missionaries came
[11:52] from abroad and he interacted with them
[11:55] so that is how he first believe in Jesus
[11:59] Christ Christ and was baptized and was
[12:01] going to churches and become a a normal
[12:04] believer that's of the Baptist Church
[12:07] that's under the Baptist Church yes okay
[12:09] so I also understand he he would then
[12:11] come to know and be a part of several
[12:12] other denominations yes yes how old were
[12:16] you then by then I was I was three and
[12:19] four and uh my mom will also uh be in
[12:24] the Baptist Church with him and she she
[12:27] there with him also and mainly what he
[12:31] does is apart from the work he goes as a
[12:35] missionary person taking that that
[12:37] gospel out of the out of the city and he
[12:41] usually ministers there and that is how
[12:44] he become to be introduced to the
[12:46] ministry okay yes so uh you you were
[12:52] born after he converted or before he
[12:54] converted after he's converted after he
[12:56] converted into Christianity so you were
[12:58] born in to a Christian home that's right
[13:00] by a former Muslim right all right right
[13:04] uh so because people would wonder Abdu
[13:07] here it is a Muslim name that is true um
[13:10] so that that's quite an a background you
[13:13] know it goes back to predestination and
[13:16] you told me the other day you were
[13:17] preaching about predestination amen how
[13:19] God knew us before even we were here
[13:22] amen uh you were born by somebody who
[13:26] came from from Islam you know background
[13:29] but he himself would convert to
[13:32] Christianity and then now we are seated
[13:34] here with a preacher of the Gospel we'll
[13:35] be able to talk more about that amen now
[13:40] um maybe our viewers what you would also
[13:42] want to
[13:44] know before we get into a little more of
[13:47] his uh the testimony of brother Ephraim
[13:51] is that
[13:53] um uh we got connected with him a little
[13:57] later uh when of of course my wife and I
[14:00] of course many of you I believe you know
[14:01] those who do not know by God's grace God
[14:04] has sent us had sent us to Ethiopia at
[14:06] the time we were there since 2013 and we
[14:09] had been doing missionary work um you
[14:13] know baptized a few people we were
[14:14] starting a Ministry there at the time
[14:17] and just having a handful of
[14:19] Believers uh in the in the young work
[14:22] which was beginning there uh but eph you
[14:26] know we get to get to know him a little
[14:28] later uh but mainly it was the
[14:31] connection the connecting Factor was his
[14:33] father um I understand that your father
[14:36] came uh came to the message yes you know
[14:39] which year he came to the
[14:41] message um he came in 2007 mhm he by
[14:47] then after he left the Baptist Church M
[14:51] he went on to a menite church okay where
[14:54] he was a pastor in a church there okay
[14:57] so when he was working the minonite
[14:59] church uh an evangelist who came from
[15:04] Kenya with the message will come to him
[15:07] and talk to him okay in the office uh so
[15:11] this this evangelist will actually
[15:13] introduce the message to him by then
[15:16] okay so afterwards he receive the
[15:19] message he told me it was not easy
[15:22] converting you he he personally told me
[15:24] it was one of the hardest job to convert
[15:26] your father from a manite not to the
[15:29] message Believers so now he converted it
[15:33] and then now he become a believer of the
[15:35] message so he left all the position he
[15:38] had in the menite church he left his
[15:41] pastoral ship and he came now to the
[15:44] message and I would think at that time
[15:47] you were about 6 seven years old exactly
[15:50] and so your father you know starts his
[15:52] journey into the message yes and uh he
[15:56] long story short passes away that's
[15:58] that's right you remember the year he
[16:00] passed away 2011 2011 yes so uh at the
[16:05] time did you and your family had you
[16:08] followed him into the message or believe
[16:10] the message yet well uh this is a main
[16:14] point that uh my
[16:17] father
[16:18] was uh was believing this
[16:22] message in the level of a ministerial
[16:25] position he was in the level of
[16:27] ministerial position Okay so so
[16:29] now before it gets deep with my mom he
[16:34] takes me and my sister everywhere he
[16:37] goes to minister this these truths that
[16:39] he has usually what he do is he give out
[16:41] books okay to different parts of the the
[16:43] the country so he will take me and my
[16:46] sister and my mom uh throughout the the
[16:50] country to give out the books that are
[16:52] printed in vgr books to give out to the
[16:54] world so the main point will be that I
[16:59] believe it was an inspiration for him to
[17:02] pass away okay because the day that he
[17:06] passed away we had a very good time with
[17:10] him yes it was so personal so uh real to
[17:14] me as I can feel it now and the more I
[17:18] get to continue with the message journey
[17:20] I understand slowly okay what happened
[17:24] was before he
[17:25] died he takes me to a trip MH
[17:29] and told me there is something that I
[17:32] want you to to know okay but it could be
[17:35] very soon but I want you to dedicate
[17:37] your life for this one and when he's
[17:40] talking about that he came from a Muslim
[17:42] background so when Muslim dedicate
[17:45] themselves for one thing it is as real
[17:48] get so he told me seriously to take this
[17:52] very seriously MH and at night we'll go
[17:55] back home he'll he'll take out a book MH
[17:58] three books that are the church age
[18:01] books The Seven Seals and the C part one
[18:04] and part two he'll give me that and the
[18:06] other one will be the CDs that are from
[18:10] 1947 up to 1968 the old CD Park he will
[18:14] give me those he told me there is
[18:17] nothing I will inherit you m but this I
[18:21] have inherited for you this is the best
[18:23] I can give you so until the last day
[18:26] hold this one never depart from of
[18:29] course by
[18:31] then uh I I listened to him but you were
[18:35] about 11 years you couldn't make up for
[18:37] everything he was saying or fully
[18:40] understand it yes and uh
[18:44] did I also understand that your mother
[18:47] and your sister at the time had also not
[18:51] uh got the revelation of the message yet
[18:54] and uh that you were closer to your
[18:58] father and he now leaves he leaves all
[19:01] the books that he had of the message or
[19:03] the work that he has he had received of
[19:05] the message to you as an inheritance
[19:07] when you don't even know what it is that
[19:09] is true that's amazing that is true so
[19:12] sometimes actually the first day I heard
[19:15] you speak that I was really moved I
[19:18] remember you you brought all those books
[19:19] to me and told me this is the
[19:21] inheritance my father left me and I was
[19:24] really moved because sometimes maybe
[19:27] this goes to the parents and whoever
[19:29] might be listening to uh to our live
[19:32] stream or or a little
[19:34] later what we our children may be young
[19:38] they may not even make up in their mind
[19:41] what we believe or what we stand for but
[19:43] it it is our responsibility to claim
[19:46] them it is our responsibility to apply
[19:48] the token upon them upon our family you
[19:52] know the message books they may see you
[19:54] reading the message books they may hear
[19:55] you listening to the tapes they may not
[19:58] understand what it is they may say
[19:59] reading the Bible but you see what they
[20:01] see and they hear it will later on a
[20:04] seed that you're planting in their life
[20:06] and will come it will later on come back
[20:08] again and it will never leave them um if
[20:12] you're doubting that wait until you hear
[20:13] the full testimony your brother Ephraim
[20:16] and so uh he passes away and then you
[20:19] you you you pack up these books and keep
[20:22] them and you know you carry on with your
[20:24] life that is true I never knew what the
[20:28] book where mhm uh all I knew is an
[20:32] instruction of my father that this thing
[20:34] is
[20:35] important because I knew he meant it
[20:38] real but I never knew what the book were
[20:41] because he
[20:43] keeps he keeps the audio in the morning
[20:46] he listen it and at night he listen it
[20:48] and I knew that voice MH and it was
[20:51] something special for him I knew it and
[20:54] that is where after he the TS of brother
[20:57] bam that's right okay that is after he
[21:00] passed now I try to take what he really
[21:03] meant let me let me see what it really
[21:05] meant so I keep listening I keep reading
[21:08] I keep listening I keep reading so where
[21:10] that is all the journey
[21:13] starts in 2013 is when my wife and I
[21:16] went to Ethiopia and uh when we arrived
[21:19] there we were of course connected to uh
[21:23] a sister and a few other people who
[21:25] later on believed and you know we
[21:27] started a Ministry with with them a
[21:29] handful of people but before we had gone
[21:32] there there are other people that had
[21:33] come into Ethiopia before us many
[21:36] brothers especially from Kenya and from
[21:38] Malawi from Zimbabwe some of them were
[21:41] expatriates working in Ethiopia and so
[21:43] among these I think is the Evangelist
[21:46] that our brother ephra talked about that
[21:48] were was able to get to his his dad and
[21:50] introduce the message to him but also
[21:53] there was another brother from uh from
[21:56] South Africa that came to visit it uh in
[21:59] Ethiopia and was connected to your dad
[22:02] yes tell me about this man and how and
[22:04] when you met him for the first time okay
[22:07] so uh Pastor Joseph from South Africa
[22:11] and my father were very close before
[22:14] they knew each other and they both go
[22:16] out for a mission to evangelize so my
[22:19] usually my father goes out with him and
[22:20] he translate for him and help him to
[22:23] reach the souls that he needed to reach
[22:25] okay so when my father passed away way
[22:29] I'll be the one taking his his SIM card
[22:32] his phone by then okay so I was taking
[22:35] every time with me and unfortunately I
[22:39] would receive a call MH and this brother
[22:43] I knew this brother that called me
[22:45] because he was one of the Believers and
[22:48] the members that my father used to uh
[22:51] minister in those in those places okay
[22:54] those are message Believers but they
[22:56] have backs leaden already because they
[22:58] they don't have someone that can take
[23:00] care of them and things like that so
[23:02] this brother will tell me a brother from
[23:05] South Africa had come and they are a
[23:07] friend of your so already I knew Brother
[23:11] Joseph okay but I was little by them but
[23:14] his he his his uh his appearance is like
[23:19] as if I have known him a very long time
[23:21] ago so Joseph will
[23:23] come I I believe it is you who received
[23:27] uh Joseph
[23:29] while you speak about his coming cuz I
[23:30] did not know that part I'm actually
[23:32] getting to know that part right on this
[23:34] interview wonderful um and no wonder we
[23:37] have four gospels and one according to
[23:40] Luke one according to mark one according
[23:41] to Matthew because one cannot cannot
[23:43] have the whole perspective of what
[23:45] really happened very true because on my
[23:47] end we of course received Brother Joseph
[23:50] when he came to visit and you know he
[23:53] did not know where to start from he
[23:54] literally came to us and he said um I
[23:57] think some brother brother Becket and
[23:59] and and in in in South Africa and other
[24:02] brothers had connected him with us I
[24:04] think brother Tim do was in South Africa
[24:07] also and when brother Tim told him that
[24:10] there was a church in Ethiopia he was
[24:12] interested and he said I'd like to go
[24:15] because I have this family that I wanted
[24:17] to track and find and so now when he
[24:19] arrived in Ethiopia we he informed me
[24:22] where he was we picked him up and then
[24:24] he told me there is this family of my
[24:27] friend who passed away uh that I would
[24:31] like to get to I'd like to find them I'd
[24:34] like to get to know how they are
[24:36] doing do you know them I said I do not
[24:40] know them I've heard of the the the the
[24:43] brother but I had never met him I wanted
[24:45] to meet him but he passed away before I
[24:47] could meet him and
[24:49] so uh we tried to drive to the place you
[24:53] know where Brother Joseph thought that
[24:55] you people were living at the time and
[24:58] you and your family we couldn't find it
[25:00] so we found eventually after a while you
[25:04] know through a lot of searching we found
[25:05] a place and these people gave us a
[25:07] contact and I think this is the contact
[25:09] that now we called and they were able to
[25:13] direct to direct us where you were now
[25:15] living at the time I don't believe it
[25:17] was easy to find us it was not because
[25:20] by then we were having a lot of uh
[25:24] financial problems with with with my mom
[25:26] so we keep shifting yes we keep shifting
[25:29] to find the actually we went to several
[25:31] places people keep kept on directing us
[25:34] this place we go there you're not there
[25:35] go to another place we don't find we go
[25:37] another place until we arrived at this
[25:40] place where you you you living at the
[25:42] time so it will be this brother calling
[25:45] me used to be a message believer but now
[25:48] Backle he told me there is a pastor that
[25:52] has come from South Africa and he is a
[25:54] friend of your father now we need to
[25:57] come to your house M so I directed them
[26:00] to to the house where we living and it
[26:03] turns out it was not Brother Joseph only
[26:05] but you were there yes and your wife was
[26:08] there yes uh brother GMA was there and
[26:11] sister yodit was there so that's how we
[26:14] met and uh when we I think it's your
[26:19] sister that came out first then your
[26:23] mother when you came out of the room
[26:27] that's a moment I'll never forget
[26:30] because it really stuck with me I saw
[26:33] you coming out and at that moment the ho
[26:36] Spirit just began moving you know you
[26:38] could tell when the Holy Spirit begins
[26:39] moving people you know feel the Holy
[26:42] Spirit differently I know how I feel the
[26:43] Holy Spirit when he's moving and he's
[26:45] going to do something and I was my wife
[26:48] was standing by my right and then I
[26:50] started telling her these words I said
[26:52] darling she said yes I said you see that
[26:55] young man coming out she said yes I said
[26:58] he's going to believe the message and
[27:01] he's also going to be a preacher of this
[27:03] message amen and my wife you know we we
[27:06] had been married then for a few years so
[27:08] she she knew well I don't see speak such
[27:11] words in an idol way and and so she said
[27:14] amen amen amen we receive that we
[27:17] believe that so later on of course we
[27:19] came and began interacting with the
[27:21] family well what do you recollect of
[27:23] those moments well I didn't know the the
[27:28] prophecy yeah of course no we did not
[27:30] share with it yet uh that
[27:34] time uh usually I spend most of the days
[27:38] in the street playing basketball trying
[27:40] to look a away of my opportunity to
[27:43] survive what should I do what is my
[27:45] career so I was having a very big whole
[27:47] space in my heart where it doesn't fit
[27:50] yet I am very interested to know what my
[27:54] father is giving me so I read them every
[27:57] day along along the way so when you came
[28:02] I thought these are just visitors and I
[28:05] knew this person Pastor Joseph he he was
[28:07] there with my father he just came to
[28:10] visit us and they're going to leave
[28:11] somehow so we receive you as a
[28:15] guest and I
[28:17] remember uh Pastor Joseph will pick up I
[28:22] don't know if it is a tablet or a Bible
[28:24] he picks up and start to speak some few
[28:27] words MH so those words that he spoke it
[28:31] was about
[28:32] Noah and his age that he's living in and
[28:36] the message that he has received and God
[28:38] has sent him for that age so whenever he
[28:41] is speaking those words I remember he's
[28:44] speaking what my father has already
[28:46] given me and then you will come up and
[28:50] you will speak uh before you pray you'll
[28:53] speak some words and I will have another
[28:56] big question in my heart
[28:58] again now why did these people came and
[29:02] now I'm realizing these people are not
[29:04] just a guest there has to be something
[29:07] with my inheritance I receive because I
[29:10] have been reading and something that I
[29:13] read is now you're repeating the same
[29:15] thing yes so that is how I just thought
[29:18] about it by then so you sit down and for
[29:23] many of you you may not realize it for
[29:25] the visitors but me now I'm getting
[29:28] impacted like right now I think now I'm
[29:31] trying to understand what my inheritance
[29:33] is
[29:35] so that is the only thing that will
[29:38] happen uh Pastor Joseph will greet my
[29:40] mom and give us respect and try whatever
[29:43] he can and he prayed and also you you
[29:45] prayed with your wife and brother gmai
[29:47] will do the same thing with his wife
[29:49] sister yodit and that is how you left us
[29:52] yes so from that moment on there was now
[29:59] attaching the book from the visitors yes
[30:02] I am starting to attach the book from
[30:04] the visitors so I will desire to know
[30:07] more of you to understand what this book
[30:10] is yes so every time I try to call
[30:14] Joseph told me that this is a trusted
[30:16] person that you can talk to to him so I
[30:19] receive your phone call and I start
[30:21] calling you how are you what are you
[30:23] doing yes and things like that so I
[30:25] think that is how now we became very
[30:28] close and you can continue from there
[30:30] and uh you've mentioned youit and G
[30:33] husband several times maybe for a
[30:35] viewers who do not know sister yodit was
[30:39] uh the woman some of you have had a
[30:41] testimony how uh the message you know
[30:44] went to
[30:46] Ethiopia
[30:48] um the the man that we met uh in Nairobi
[30:53] gave after baptizing him uh he gave me
[30:57] this contact he said please if you would
[30:59] uh go and baptize my brother but also uh
[31:04] if he believes and also my my priest so
[31:07] he gave me the contact of his brother
[31:08] and his priest so both of them came but
[31:10] the priest had it accepted it but did
[31:13] not believe it but his brother actually
[31:17] was so impacted by it and was baptized
[31:19] that same day so when he came out of the
[31:21] water he gave me a contact of a sister
[31:24] and you know this would turn out to be
[31:25] sister yodit and it's not y his
[31:28] testimony today so we will not go in the
[31:29] details of that but youit really was a
[31:32] great pillar in the in the early uh time
[31:34] and starting out to to reach out so by
[31:37] this time I think it was a few years
[31:39] after her her conversion because she was
[31:42] already married and the church had
[31:44] already been started and so the work was
[31:46] already going on we had several
[31:48] Believers by then I think we had
[31:51] about uh 20 Believers or so at the time
[31:54] and the church had already been
[31:56] established and so
[31:58] um we now find Ephraim and his family uh
[32:02] they had had an encounter of the message
[32:05] but not the family when the dad passed
[32:07] away the family had not yet uh fully
[32:09] understood really I should say that uh
[32:12] the message in his entirety but now you
[32:14] understand this is the only uh
[32:17] inheritance that your dad had left for
[32:19] you and here are people one from South
[32:22] Africa one from uh two from I don't
[32:25] remember where they were two or one from
[32:26] Ethiopia and then myself and my wife
[32:28] from Uganda and here we are speaking
[32:31] about things that were so connected to
[32:34] your inheritance so you got interested
[32:38] amen you know when people talk about
[32:42] inheritance it sounds like a lot of
[32:44] lands houses and Estates but to you it
[32:48] was something Eternal amen something
[32:52] Eternal amen
[32:54] um I think we'll talk about about that a
[32:58] little more shortly so then
[33:01] um we depart after exchanging contacts
[33:05] and I don't remember do you remember how
[33:07] did we meet again uh did you call or how
[33:10] how did that happen uh I'll be I think
[33:12] I'm the one to call you MH uh because I
[33:16] wanted to find out if what you're saying
[33:20] is connected to the my inheritance that
[33:23] I've been holding for for the last many
[33:25] years yes so if somehow it turns out to
[33:29] be interested with the with the in
[33:31] irritance that I have so I'll continue
[33:33] with you until I found out what's the
[33:35] point of it yes that is the main reason
[33:37] I called you yes so to see whatever
[33:40] you're saying would link up with this
[33:42] yes and so you called me and we received
[33:45] you I remember we went even at home and
[33:48] we even went at church and
[33:51] um the memor is a little bit fuzzy then
[33:55] tell me of the things you recollect I me
[33:57] it's meetings actually the the guest
[34:00] that we hosted by then when you came and
[34:03] when uh Pastor Joseph came and when
[34:07] brother GMA came it was an
[34:10] international people coming to our house
[34:14] so he he insist for me to come on Sunday
[34:18] so he'll be preaching on Sunday okay so
[34:20] that is the first someone I heard him
[34:23] preaching about and it was about the
[34:26] Fifth's gospel okay who was preaching uh
[34:29] Brother Joseph oh he were we were still
[34:31] having him at church yes we were hosting
[34:33] him so he was the first to preach in the
[34:35] Fifth Gospel was the mother so he was
[34:38] speaking I still have the the memory
[34:41] what he was speaking on whatever he will
[34:44] be speaking on will make me Zeal zealous
[34:47] to understand more about my inheritance
[34:50] because he's touching some few points
[34:52] that I've known already so that is what
[34:56] will open my heart to come to you you
[34:58] and now I'll become so close to you so
[35:01] in touch to you to know more about it so
[35:04] there is one time I know and I came to
[35:07] your house and I told
[35:08] you does the message that my father
[35:12] preached and received is it the same
[35:14] with youth and I remember that I
[35:16] remember that question yes because now
[35:19] if it is not I'm not wasting my time I I
[35:21] I'll shift and do my things so when you
[35:24] tell me yes then I became more
[35:27] interested in you okay and try to
[35:29] understand more what what it is all
[35:31] about okay so when I come to your house
[35:34] Mama SAR mamaa was there the children
[35:38] two of them was there so you gave me you
[35:42] gave me uh a book yes so when I saw that
[35:47] book yes the the the message book I say
[35:50] this picture on top of this picture I
[35:52] have it at home M and I came to tell you
[35:56] that I have this book now see this book
[35:59] in those books I have underlined it I
[36:01] have things of I wrote on this I have
[36:03] question marks something like that so
[36:05] now I'll become so close to you to
[36:08] understand what it is all about and I
[36:10] will come to the office and tell you I
[36:12] have I am more interested to know about
[36:15] this now yes do you remember how many
[36:17] services you attended then before the
[36:19] decision was made uh I only attended
[36:23] Joseph's uh Pastor Joseph service and I
[36:26] left and then you left yes M yeah and
[36:29] after I left I will contact to you in
[36:33] one year MH that will be 20 2017 still
[36:37] in the end of the year so that is when I
[36:39] became so close to you and you start
[36:42] telling me what the message is all about
[36:45] yes and uh at the time you were in
[36:48] school and
[36:50] um you know I think I don't remember
[36:53] which grade you were concluding then
[36:55] yeah um and there is a time you came uh
[37:00] back to church and uh after I think you
[37:05] you you you disappeared for quite a long
[37:08] time and then you reappeared what made
[37:11] you disappear for a long time uh the
[37:13] disappear came from before I was
[37:16] baptized okay uh because someone told me
[37:20] I should be baptized and I
[37:22] said why would I be baptized and why
[37:26] would someone think of baptizing me and
[37:31] so I'll start to have these doubts of
[37:35] the message and I remember the devil was
[37:38] trying to attack with a lot of
[37:40] depression I was having a lot of
[37:43] depression trying to make me live this
[37:46] inheritance that I've been focusing all
[37:48] those years and even in the school even
[37:51] in the life everything that I was seeing
[37:53] it was putting me down and putting me
[37:55] down and putting me down so I said which
[37:58] was not the right decision I said let me
[38:01] separate myself from everything and I I
[38:03] will see how the life goes when I do
[38:06] that I couldn't do it without the books
[38:08] yeah I couldn't do it without the CDs so
[38:10] every time I have to listen to those and
[38:13] one time I said there is the thoughts
[38:17] that my father spoke the instruction
[38:20] that he gave me the the the real the
[38:22] real feeling I felt it in my heart and I
[38:24] say now if I'm going to give it my all I
[38:28] have to be baptized if I'm not going to
[38:31] leave it at all I I should stay away
[38:33] from it so it came to a point where I
[38:35] should decide so for that decision to
[38:38] happen you know decision is a process
[38:40] for that process to happen I was taking
[38:43] a long time a long time away from the
[38:46] church seeing all the opportunity I can
[38:49] take so there is a time I said
[38:52] now I will be baptized yeah there is
[38:55] nothing that will stop me so I called
[38:57] brother gmai and he's a person that I I
[39:00] shared with and then he takes me to you
[39:04] and then I'll be baptized that Sunday
[39:07] and it changed all my life after that
[39:10] and uh what do you recollect after your
[39:12] baptism uh did you come back to church
[39:15] yes so now before I baptized I said I'm
[39:19] going to dedicate myself to this message
[39:22] I didn't know nothing about Ministry I
[39:23] didn't know nothing about singing
[39:25] worship all I knew
[39:27] is there is nothing that is changed
[39:30] outside like my physical body the things
[39:33] I have look there is nothing but
[39:35] something has changed in my heart there
[39:37] is a inner peace I have found that will
[39:40] change my heart and that peace allowed
[39:44] me to settle allowed me to come down in
[39:47] one place and then listen to the
[39:50] sermon what was um what is your
[39:54] recollection of the services cuz I know
[39:58] now you had been baptized and you'd be
[40:00] coming of course me I see new people
[40:02] people come people go and you never know
[40:05] who is really feeding or who is here for
[40:08] what um but I would like to know now I'm
[40:10] getting into your mind where I wasn't
[40:13] then when you would come in the
[40:16] services what would be your perspective
[40:18] on the services how would they impact
[40:20] your life all right
[40:22] now I mean this is someone uh who is I I
[40:27] know Ethiopians you call us Africans as
[40:29] if you're not
[40:31] Africans so this is someone from Africa
[40:34] preaching and uh and uh you know he's a
[40:38] foreigner and you know he's shouting all
[40:39] over the place and and then I mean how
[40:43] were you making of what was going on
[40:46] wonderful now to make it to church was
[40:50] was very difficult for me because
[40:53] because of the transport I have to take
[40:55] four taxis to reach to to the to the to
[40:59] the service and we have service every
[41:01] Wednesday every Friday and every Sunday
[41:05] yes Sunday was not a challenge but
[41:07] making it on Wednesday and Friday was a
[41:09] challenge so the decision I made before
[41:13] baptism help me to come to the churches
[41:17] yes and whenever I I'm coming to this
[41:20] service it becames real it is becoming
[41:24] more real and more real to me every time
[41:26] I'm Fellowship there so now I believe
[41:30] that is the phase I took to dedicate
[41:33] myself for that time and I dedicated
[41:36] myself just to listen what the preacher
[41:39] is preaching of course I didn't come
[41:41] with an open heart by then I came with a
[41:44] prepared book with a prepared notes to
[41:47] see a mistake from the preacher so
[41:49] that's how I will come on the first of
[41:51] phases the second phase will be now I
[41:55] wanted to to to impact myself with those
[41:58] words and settle in my heart I want
[42:01] those words to be settled in my heart
[42:04] that was the process in the bridge I was
[42:06] having by then I think this is uh giving
[42:09] me a little inspiration to tell our
[42:11] viewers um maybe a minister or a younger
[42:14] minister or a younger Pastor might be
[42:16] watching this or watch this
[42:17] later sometimes we want people to
[42:21] believe and be changed that same
[42:23] day um it's a process it's a proc
[42:27] process because I mean imagine someone
[42:28] coming in the first time they they are
[42:32] coming to find mistakes the second time
[42:35] you know they are coming to know they're
[42:37] coming with an open heart so I think we
[42:40] also need to focus on what we are
[42:42] preaching and thank God for this message
[42:43] because in this message we're not
[42:45] preaching our ideas or our thoughts
[42:48] we're not preaching about Visa getting
[42:49] Visa or getting rich or getting this as
[42:52] much as all those things are good and
[42:53] they have their place in the Kingdom but
[42:56] we are to preach the word it is the word
[42:58] that molds a character or the character
[43:01] of God in the people because the people
[43:02] are hungry for the word but if you give
[43:05] them the word then the word will do the
[43:07] work brother bam says that the word
[43:09] corrects the error and so let's talk
[43:11] about the opposition um there was a time
[43:14] that you had opposition from your family
[43:16] about coming to church was it before
[43:18] baptism or after baptism it was uh after
[43:22] baptism because before I was baptized I
[43:25] have to inform them that I'll be going
[43:27] going to the to the to the church yes
[43:31] so my
[43:34] mother had a special gift she had a gift
[43:38] of discernment yes she don't care
[43:40] whether the the person knows about
[43:42] Genesis to Revelation or or from 1947 up
[43:46] to 65 all those things she have a
[43:49] special gift called discernment
[43:53] so she will she will have those question
[43:57] in her
[43:58] heart if this boy goes to this if I let
[44:02] him go and he is dedicated to this what
[44:05] about his his job what about his school
[44:09] what about because if I get hold of
[44:11] something I will take it as it is until
[44:14] I found what it is all about so she was
[44:17] leaning more for me to to have the
[44:21] school to focus on the school and to
[44:22] focus on the side jobs that I'm doing so
[44:26] that's real point of view of things yes
[44:30] so but there is a point she
[44:34] said right now I have seen
[44:38] something I believe that is the right
[44:40] place for you to go because she didn't
[44:43] want me to stay in the street and wait
[44:45] for some job to come and I take it she
[44:47] said that is the best thing you can do
[44:49] is go to that church I believe not do
[44:51] that I believe it is the Lord spoker to
[44:53] do that because if I'm working there and
[44:57] she's singing I'm benefited and I'm
[44:58] going to school she'll be happy for me
[45:00] to do that but the Lord spoke to her
[45:03] that she'll be happy interested if I go
[45:05] there MH so out of nowhere this happens
[45:09] but she told me she's not coming with me
[45:12] yes I remember that yeah yes so there is
[45:15] a special reason for her to say that
[45:18] which which is not necessary to speak
[45:21] but she said I will not go to that
[45:22] church specific something to do with her
[45:24] past encounters and yes because she have
[45:26] encounter the message Believers before
[45:28] yeah and she knows things that was not
[45:31] happy for her
[45:33] and after that
[45:36] now is a time where I tell her what I
[45:40] have heard in the church where I respond
[45:42] to her what I have heard in the church
[45:44] and when she see that process going on
[45:46] and going on going on she already knew
[45:48] the message she already knew what what
[45:51] it is all about but for her to join the
[45:54] fellowship it was the hard part yeah so
[45:57] slowly when she see the progress and
[45:59] slowly when she see things are changing
[46:02] and things are improving and things are
[46:04] God is doing something from the inside
[46:07] then she came up to
[46:08] me and she said on Sunday I'm going with
[46:12] you praise God so I was surprised I said
[46:16] okay we will go together and you know
[46:19] Ephraim when it comes to parents uh let
[46:22] me talk a little bit about that as well
[46:24] when it comes to parents sometimes uh
[46:27] parents want to look at things in a a
[46:30] realistic uh point of view my son has to
[46:33] go to school my daughter has to go to
[46:35] school I'm going to even take them to
[46:37] the best school I'm going to take them
[46:39] to hostel I want them to get the best
[46:42] results get the best job but the whole
[46:45] time they're not considering the
[46:47] spiritual life of this child yes you see
[46:51] it's a good thing to want your child to
[46:53] want the best for your child but also
[46:54] consider the spiritual life of this
[46:56] child as much as he is growing in the
[46:59] things of the world and in the knowledge
[47:01] of the things of the world he also needs
[47:03] to grow in the knowledge of the things
[47:04] of God because you see both of of these
[47:07] things are needed and after all it is
[47:09] God who really controls and and and and
[47:13] makes all things work out and then on
[47:15] the other part of how your mother the
[47:17] perspective she had of the former or the
[47:21] some Believers that she had received um
[47:24] been in contact with perhaps maybe three
[47:26] or five
[47:28] it also goes to show that it is not what
[47:30] we speak it is the life that we live
[47:34] because you see our Prophet
[47:36] said show me don't he said that instead
[47:40] of preaching me as someone leave me one
[47:42] the life that we live will preach to the
[47:44] people and will make them want the the
[47:47] message that we have but if our life
[47:50] says something else other than what we
[47:53] are uh are saying then people won't be
[47:55] interested they won't be interested so
[47:58] your mother I believe she I don't know
[48:01] why but I think when she let you come
[48:03] and then you started you know coming for
[48:06] a while then she also got interested and
[48:09] started coming I don't know like I said
[48:11] but I I I want to believe that it must
[48:13] have been what she had been what she had
[48:16] seen you becoming that is true I I
[48:19] believe the Lord SP to her directly by
[48:22] them because she will not make that kind
[48:25] of decision out of nowhere
[48:27] because you see my father was a minister
[48:32] and she was with him and one thing I
[48:35] know he doesn't baptize people quickly
[48:39] he want them to come to him to ask them
[48:41] for baptism because in the scripture we
[48:44] see it was not Paul it was not Peter
[48:48] instructing the people now let me
[48:50] baptize you he didn't preach to them
[48:51] about baptism sermon no he preached to
[48:54] them about Christ this Christ has made
[48:57] him both Lord and Jesus Christ for you
[49:00] now when he was speaking that word that
[49:03] word inside of
[49:04] them B the question up to him and said
[49:08] what can we do now and he instructed
[49:11] them now you can be baptized so you see
[49:15] that is what there's only one instance
[49:17] in the scripture where the apostles H
[49:21] asked the people to be baptized and that
[49:22] was in the house of Cornelius yes when
[49:24] they had received the Holy Spirit then
[49:26] Peter told told them now if you have
[49:28] received the spirit like us then be
[49:29] baptized as a proof that you have
[49:31] received the Holy Ghost otherwise all
[49:33] the other places it was the people the
[49:34] kind is asking baptize us that is true
[49:37] yeah sure so I have seen those things
[49:40] happening in the fellowship but after my
[49:43] pass my father passed away she saw a
[49:46] very wrong Spirit she saw something that
[49:49] was not appropriate so it made her leave
[49:54] the leave the leave the membership or
[49:56] the fellowship that were there and my
[49:59] sister took the same decision with her
[50:02] so now it was a very difficult process
[50:05] to let them know it is the same
[50:08] message but different it is different
[50:11] people it is a different Fellowship now
[50:14] so slowly she was able to understand it
[50:18] by God's grace and I believe the Lord
[50:21] has informed her to do this and she she
[50:24] went to church I wish she was here but
[50:27] to to answer this but you'll answer on
[50:29] her behalf when she came what was her
[50:31] comment after coming to the church she
[50:33] was still very suspicious about it yes
[50:36] even though the Lord spoke for her to go
[50:39] she was really suspicious about it but
[50:41] it was a sad service that made her
[50:46] accept now this truth and actually can
[50:49] be in this Fellowship so that is when we
[50:53] start now coming regularly to church now
[50:55] she's free she can worship and she have
[50:58] met the Lord there by herself yes amen
[51:02] and um there is a time I think I don't
[51:04] remember for after how long maybe
[51:06] shortly after baptism or before baptism
[51:07] I do not remember you can remind me then
[51:11] uh she let you come to our house was
[51:15] that after baptism or before that was
[51:17] after the fellowship after I have after
[51:19] she also started coming yes okay uh how
[51:22] did she allow you to do something like
[51:23] that um
[51:27] the same way that God has told her let
[51:30] your child go to that church I I believe
[51:33] that will resolve everything MH yes so
[51:38] uh because my wife and I you know talked
[51:41] we we in a foreign country and we had to
[51:43] really be
[51:45] careful uh and I know I had people
[51:48] around me who would always advis you
[51:50] have to be careful you know you're not
[51:53] in Uganda you have to be careful you
[51:55] know how you bring people close and and
[51:58] but you know we just decided within
[51:59] ourselves we said no we're going to
[52:01] adopt this boy we're going to make him
[52:03] our son and um we we just I don't
[52:08] remember even how we discussed but then
[52:10] you end up in our house yes uh how how
[52:14] was it was our was your stay in our
[52:16] house
[52:18] and uh as our child at the time I don't
[52:22] remember how long maybe one year or one
[52:24] year and a half or two um um did it
[52:28] bring you closer to the Lord or did it
[52:29] take you further away did you learn more
[52:32] or did you learn less yeah actually I
[52:35] stayed there for one year mhm and in
[52:38] that year is now where I knew I am
[52:43] called for something yes because my
[52:46] father used to tell my mother he is he
[52:50] is a a minister of the the gospel and I
[52:54] used to run around and play with it or
[52:56] whatever he said and my mother has
[52:58] caught up the same thing tells me I am I
[53:00] the minister of the Gospel but she knew
[53:04] if I go to that lane I will I will I
[53:07] will lose some balance so she's trying
[53:09] to keep me in both sides where I can
[53:12] so that is a time I felt like there is
[53:16] something God has called me for but I
[53:19] don't know what that calling was by then
[53:22] but I start feeling that call but I
[53:25] don't know how how to respond to that
[53:27] calling because I don't know what the
[53:29] calling is it started with a burden with
[53:32] a heavy burden to the lost souls and by
[53:36] then I don't know what the calling is I
[53:38] don't know if it is singing I don't know
[53:40] if it is uh worshiping I don't know if
[53:42] it is cleaning I don't know but I knew
[53:45] there was a calling but I cannot be
[53:47] specific on that calling so that was the
[53:50] experience I was having by then and then
[53:54] before the last uh year
[53:58] end there was a brother from Kenya
[54:01] brother Daniel who came and preached for
[54:04] us on Friday service and his sermon
[54:09] was receiving the Holy Ghost yes so on
[54:13] Friday night after I heard the sermon we
[54:17] go back home and I keep asking the Lord
[54:20] what is this Holy Ghost I felt and I
[54:22] felt a trust that I should receive this
[54:25] Holy Ghost because they keep saying Holy
[54:27] Ghost it will make you do this it will
[54:29] make you do this it will so I want to
[54:31] know what the Holy Ghost is and I cannot
[54:35] know it by my knowledge I want to feel
[54:36] it I want to experience it myself so
[54:39] after his suon that left a question mark
[54:42] in my heart to go back and seek and I
[54:45] realize The More I Seek is the more I
[54:49] pray for the Holy Ghost to come and
[54:50] change my life and those two were my two
[54:54] experience in that house for one year
[54:57] yeah and you receive the Holy Ghost can
[55:00] you tell us your experience about that
[55:02] um tell the viewers cuz I know now many
[55:05] right now are waiting to hear how did he
[55:08] receive the Holy Ghost and when and how
[55:11] good because you see this is a question
[55:13] that many have but until someone gives
[55:15] their own experience of it and testimony
[55:19] I mean yours may not be someone else's
[55:22] yes to someone it may you know be very
[55:24] simple and to another one it may be but
[55:26] God fulfills his promise amen so now uh
[55:31] what I can speak is when you receive the
[55:34] Holy Ghost it says you will know the
[55:37] date and you will never forgot that date
[55:40] yeah because it is some experience of
[55:43] your life that you never had before the
[55:46] reason we need a second birth is
[55:55] because
[56:25] e e
[57:13] exactly it cannot debate with the word
[57:16] so it has to come right that's why you
[57:17] see many
[57:19] people they have they claim to have the
[57:21] Holy Ghost but they still deny the word
[57:24] and they still have a woman preacher
[57:26] because they receive the Holy Ghost on
[57:29] their body not on their souls yes they
[57:32] could be baptized on their Spirit Room
[57:35] and in the in the in the flesh but not
[57:38] in the soul that's right so it's a must
[57:41] for every believer to receive the holy
[57:42] spirit amen you know must have that
[57:44] experience amen
[57:47] um then you went back home and after all
[57:51] this experience and we were privileged I
[57:54] I should say uh and the other time in
[57:56] the church I said I'm very proud of you
[57:58] because we were privileged to be a a
[58:00] little pit a little piece and part of
[58:02] your life and and and and and you know
[58:05] to just be a blessing and to be counted
[58:09] worthy to be a part of that because I
[58:11] know uh God has called you for a special
[58:14] purpose in our generation and you know
[58:17] comes to show as we will speak a little
[58:19] bit
[58:20] briefly uh about the work that God is
[58:22] doing through you currently now
[58:26] so uh when you went back home there's a
[58:28] brother came from uh I think Australia
[58:32] Brother Gary Walker you remember him yes
[58:35] and then he he had a burden to uh give
[58:38] everyone in the church at the time a
[58:40] library of the message of the hour and
[58:43] when you say that now your heart was
[58:45] receptive to the message I I remember
[58:46] that bit because um I came up I came
[58:50] down here at the offices of vgr and we
[58:53] were able to buy packs of books
[58:56] um and every believer was able to
[58:59] receive a pack of their own having a
[59:01] full seed library of the message that is
[59:03] true I'm sure you feed on that yes yes
[59:08] how was
[59:09] that now uh actually I want to speak on
[59:13] those things uh for the for the for the
[59:17] viewers or for the people that are
[59:20] listening um it is good to start the
[59:24] message from now
[59:27] 1947 the reason I said it because
[59:30] wherever I see the books I could just
[59:31] pick up and read it but for someone to
[59:35] know what the message is or for for him
[59:38] to preach or for him to have his own
[59:40] mystry from it it is very best to start
[59:43] from 47 until 65 that is very important
[59:48] because to understand
[59:53] Moses we have to understand josa josua
[59:57] because Jo Moses had the first pool and
[1:00:00] the second pool but Joshua is the one
[1:00:03] who had the third pool and when we see
[1:00:05] in the New Testament Jesus Christ had
[1:00:07] the first pool and the second pool but
[1:00:09] it was Paul who had the third pool so
[1:00:13] now it is very important to understand
[1:00:16] the image of the message not only
[1:00:19] pointing Joshua or not only pointing
[1:00:23] Moses so for us to understand what the
[1:00:26] message is it is best to have the
[1:00:29] library it is best to know the message
[1:00:31] from 47 up to 65 that is when we have
[1:00:36] now understood the problem is people
[1:00:38] will start from 65 and stay in 65 and
[1:00:42] don't know the approach of the
[1:00:44] 47s that's why you see why people have
[1:00:48] left the message you see they only
[1:00:51] understood the 65 they only understood
[1:00:53] the thir pull of it they didn't
[1:00:55] understand the the second pool and the
[1:00:57] first pool so that's why you see they
[1:00:59] pick up errors they do this they do this
[1:01:02] why because the the message image they
[1:01:05] have is only on 65 or based on 47 only
[1:01:09] so having the books at your homes is
[1:01:13] very essential yes listening to the
[1:01:16] tapes reading the books when you go back
[1:01:19] to the Bible it is a new book amen so
[1:01:22] that's what you did you fed amen you fed
[1:01:24] on the message and I remember if there
[1:01:26] is one thing that I can say that I or my
[1:01:28] Ministry did in Ethiopia is we
[1:01:31] encouraged the brothers the sisters
[1:01:33] everyone that was directly under our
[1:01:35] ministry to feed on the message study
[1:01:38] the message hear it read it because in
[1:01:41] there is rupturing faith we believe and
[1:01:44] um and so your mother and your sister
[1:01:49] later on believe the message and was
[1:01:51] baptized and they were baptized and so
[1:01:53] it was a full family now of believers
[1:01:55] that's true and later on your sister got
[1:01:57] married and you know your mother who was
[1:02:00] always sad she became the happiest in
[1:02:03] the church true and here is the great
[1:02:05] deal you also did not become the same
[1:02:09] after that and that now brings us to uh
[1:02:12] another phase of this testimony so then
[1:02:15] we would start
[1:02:17] to uh come with you to Uganda you know
[1:02:19] for you to visit I think you visited the
[1:02:21] first time and then the second time and
[1:02:23] then this other time you uh you visited
[1:02:28] one of uh believers who were in Ethiopia
[1:02:32] at the time and uh you know you linked
[1:02:36] up with the daughter of the sister who
[1:02:38] was they were in Ethiopia and then they
[1:02:39] were in
[1:02:41] Uganda I don't know what you saw in
[1:02:43] sister
[1:02:45] Emma
[1:02:46] um my wife so to speak is uh is a a
[1:02:52] different she have a very different and
[1:02:55] unique character in her yes and I'm sure
[1:02:57] she's listening to this I hope so I hope
[1:03:01] so you see
[1:03:04] uh the first time that we got to to see
[1:03:09] each other was I came to
[1:03:11] Uganda and after I came to Uganda uh we
[1:03:15] went to uh Mama Sara's house to pay a
[1:03:19] visit and in that visit my wife was not
[1:03:22] there but um her sister will send me an
[1:03:26] envelope to give it to someone in our
[1:03:29] church and I didn't know she was in my
[1:03:32] in our church yes but when I gave that
[1:03:34] envelope to the sister in Ethiopia that
[1:03:38] is when I saw her and that is when I see
[1:03:41] that's when the Revelation struck you
[1:03:42] that's right Hallelujah you call it a
[1:03:44] burden
[1:03:46] maybe and that goes that takes me back
[1:03:49] to a few years ago when you were still
[1:03:51] in our house and we were still in
[1:03:52] Ethiopia and I was telling you the
[1:03:54] testimony on how I got married and how
[1:03:57] at what age I was and I think I was told
[1:03:59] you I married at 21 and you said I am
[1:04:03] also going to marry at 21 do you
[1:04:05] remember those words I believe those
[1:04:07] were inspiration yes it was yes it was
[1:04:09] not just a word it inspir it was an
[1:04:11] inspiration yes because by then there is
[1:04:14] no way no way I it will not happen so um
[1:04:20] but slowly when I get to know her when I
[1:04:23] see her character it was was it was very
[1:04:26] different she was she was a very
[1:04:28] different soul she was a different
[1:04:30] unique character so that made me
[1:04:33] interested in her yeah so by then she
[1:04:36] was baptized she was a Believer you took
[1:04:38] her to to C her to baptize her in that
[1:04:41] Lake and she was studying the message
[1:04:44] and we study the message together we we
[1:04:46] get a phone call and we start talking
[1:04:48] about the message and the word so
[1:04:51] finally there was a time that we should
[1:04:54] make a decision M and uh we made that
[1:04:57] decision to stay together all I said is
[1:05:02] uh she was just sitting there and I was
[1:05:04] driving a car she was listening to what
[1:05:05] I said and I told her there is one thing
[1:05:08] I want to do and I told her I want to
[1:05:11] rest I want to spend my whole life with
[1:05:15] you wow specifically for you wow and she
[1:05:19] didn't reply she didn't speak and after
[1:05:21] two minutes of thinking she said have
[1:05:24] you prayed about it
[1:05:26] and I told her yes I've been praying
[1:05:27] about it yes so she told me let me also
[1:05:30] pray about it yeah she didn't say yes I
[1:05:33] know you had previously before that you
[1:05:34] had told me about it and I had you know
[1:05:37] we had agreed that you would pray about
[1:05:39] it and be fast that's that's right so
[1:05:42] she she goes back to her residence she
[1:05:45] prays about it and somehow I I thought
[1:05:49] she's not going to call me back I
[1:05:50] thought that is a no because she was
[1:05:52] taking longer but there is a time she
[1:05:54] called me and she said I have received
[1:05:57] your request mhm so from then is when we
[1:06:00] start to move on and the rest is history
[1:06:02] the rest is history well maybe the
[1:06:04] brother can put us uh put up a picture
[1:06:06] of you and your wife and baby you had a
[1:06:09] wonderful wedding here and and then you
[1:06:11] have a wonderful family and she's been
[1:06:13] working here and now coming to join you
[1:06:15] in Ethiopia I'm sure that it it is for
[1:06:18] it's it's a perfect timing amen
[1:06:20] especially for the work of the ministry
[1:06:22] that you're doing that is true so um uh
[1:06:26] things happen I come back to Uganda you
[1:06:28] continue on in the church in in Adis
[1:06:31] Ababa and Pastor morus uh and then
[1:06:35] things happened and you went to aasa
[1:06:37] yeah after you
[1:06:39] left uh we my mom saw a vision it it all
[1:06:46] starts with my mom uh she's a very
[1:06:48] prayerful woman and she saw a a a vision
[1:06:52] where I'm driving a bulletproof car okay
[1:06:55] and is very white and inside there was a
[1:06:58] lot of food packed so for those food to
[1:07:02] be hot it was sealed in the back the the
[1:07:05] food Corner were sealed so she was
[1:07:07] telling me you are driving this car in a
[1:07:09] very high speed to aasa and she told me
[1:07:13] that I feel the Lord is calling you to e
[1:07:16] to to aasa to go but by
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:20] then um I'm I'm I'm we are still
[1:07:23] thinking about with my wife to come to
[1:07:25] to Uganda to stay there and to do to
[1:07:27] find out what to do next or to continue
[1:07:30] with my school or to upgrade on my job
[1:07:32] things like that so it was a very hard
[1:07:35] moment for me to decide what to do and I
[1:07:37] told the Lord if you are the one calling
[1:07:39] me to aasa confirm that to me because
[1:07:43] you see in Ephesians chapter 1 verse one
[1:07:45] it says an apostle of Jesus Christ Paul
[1:07:51] called by God not by a man m or Not by a
[1:07:56] bishop because I want to go with a
[1:07:58] confirmation so I know what I am doing
[1:08:01] there so I went to a prayer and when the
[1:08:06] Lord put it in my heart for a burden for
[1:08:08] me to go there I just wrote your text
[1:08:11] yes I feel like I'm starting the
[1:08:13] ministry and I'm I was I was I was
[1:08:15] texting I remember the Lord is now
[1:08:17] guiding me to hour I don't know what he
[1:08:19] has a store for me but I just know he's
[1:08:22] the one who leading me so I told you and
[1:08:24] that is how we begin um maybe I just
[1:08:27] take a moment here to uh while you take
[1:08:30] a little race and maybe a little drink
[1:08:33] to tell the viewers about uh
[1:08:36] haasa um the ministry in haasa really
[1:08:39] did not start until uh one of us a
[1:08:43] brother who was a deacon in in the
[1:08:45] church in Adis Ababa a brother from
[1:08:47] Kenya his name is brother brother Tim we
[1:08:51] call him brother Timothy uh Timothy
[1:08:53] muhanji he
[1:08:55] um was able to get a job he had a job
[1:08:59] close to Adis but he got a job now a new
[1:09:02] job in haasa and uh there was no message
[1:09:06] Church there in that town he had gone to
[1:09:08] a a Oneness Church which is really very
[1:09:11] close to the message and you know most
[1:09:12] of their teachings and but um you know I
[1:09:15] kept on encouraging him saying that you
[1:09:18] know God sent him there for our purpose
[1:09:20] and um after a little time he had been
[1:09:24] there he was uh managing a factory there
[1:09:28] God connected him to one of the workers
[1:09:31] his co-workers at the at the at the
[1:09:33] factory uh brother tesan and brother
[1:09:36] tesan after hearing the message traveled
[1:09:39] all the way how many hours is it I think
[1:09:41] four hours four five hours yes to Adis
[1:09:45] Ababa but but the Tim at the time was
[1:09:46] traveling every weekend you know to come
[1:09:48] to the service in
[1:09:50] in in Adisa so he at that time traveled
[1:09:54] with
[1:09:56] after brother tesan had received a
[1:09:58] witness from brother Timothy and brother
[1:10:00] tesan was baptized in the church in in
[1:10:03] in Adis Ababa and so from that time we
[1:10:07] would now continue going back and forth
[1:10:09] in haasa at one time I I remember I went
[1:10:12] with pastor morgus at the time he was my
[1:10:15] associate in the ministry and then at
[1:10:18] another time and I think most of the
[1:10:20] time I went with you brother Ephraim and
[1:10:23] also with brother ased
[1:10:26] uh and uh we would just go there meet
[1:10:29] people um I even I think I I had a
[1:10:32] picture there I don't know whether you
[1:10:33] can find brother Isaac of myself and and
[1:10:35] brother Ephraim um and brother tesan and
[1:10:41] brother Timothy yes if you can put that
[1:10:42] up for the people as well so we would
[1:10:45] meet people like in in restaurants in
[1:10:47] areas just meet people talk to them uh
[1:10:50] give them the message and um uh some
[1:10:53] sometimes University students from from
[1:10:55] the University and tell them about the
[1:10:57] message and you know it it it looked a
[1:11:00] bit difficult but from time to time
[1:11:03] people would come into the message and
[1:11:05] one time you know there was like a big
[1:11:07] Revival just something happened all of
[1:11:10] the sudden and and people uh just just
[1:11:14] came
[1:11:15] up I I had returned to Uganda already
[1:11:18] but then you know I had this great
[1:11:20] burden Co time yes that that was during
[1:11:23] covid time I would never forget that
[1:11:25] brother Ephraim because at that time you
[1:11:27] know God laid a burden on me to go to
[1:11:30] haasa specifically haasa I told brother
[1:11:32] mgas I'm not even coming to Adis that
[1:11:34] much I'm going to aasa and I told the
[1:11:36] people I feel God is going to do
[1:11:38] something great this time and so um we
[1:11:42] went to
[1:11:43] aasa I contracted covid I didn't even
[1:11:46] know went with brother Ken from from
[1:11:48] Nairobi and so we were there the whole
[1:11:50] time preaching to these people but there
[1:11:52] was God used by the assed God used by
[1:11:54] the te othy God used brother Ken God
[1:11:56] used us in a way that we never imagined
[1:11:59] people just came like mushrooms we
[1:12:01] baptized brother ephra 30 people in one
[1:12:05] trip and the whole time we had covid and
[1:12:07] we didn't even know we had covid at that
[1:12:09] time I even recorded some um Outreach
[1:12:12] messages and I was coughing the whole
[1:12:14] time I didn't even know I had Co but by
[1:12:17] God's grace the church was started in
[1:12:19] the house of brother Timothy brother
[1:12:22] Timothy supported with everything that
[1:12:23] he can and he is a really really solid
[1:12:26] solid brother he did a great work in
[1:12:28] that in that City and uh whenever myself
[1:12:31] and brother Ephraim myself and brother
[1:12:33] ased or myself and another brother went
[1:12:35] there you know uh he would support he
[1:12:38] would you know um you know buy meals for
[1:12:41] the people in his house and his wife
[1:12:43] Salia would cook I mean there many
[1:12:45] people sometimes we sit with people here
[1:12:47] at the bench and talk about things but
[1:12:49] there are many other people behind the
[1:12:50] scenes that really have done and
[1:12:53] continue to do a lot of work to support
[1:12:56] what God is doing especially in Ethiopia
[1:12:58] and the work of the ministry there
[1:12:59] that's true and so uh the church was
[1:13:02] started and then we the people were now
[1:13:04] many we had to find a place uh we have
[1:13:06] some pictures there brother uh brother
[1:13:08] Isaac um of the church so we we we found
[1:13:13] a place rented it up and and U put up a
[1:13:16] structure and there was a church and and
[1:13:19] and and you know people were like 30 40
[1:13:22] at times
[1:13:23] 50 and but I was no longer in Ethiopia
[1:13:27] time came brother Timothy left aasa uh
[1:13:31] back to Kenya uh time came there was
[1:13:35] nobody uh yes of course there were other
[1:13:37] brothers um that brother tesan was there
[1:13:40] brother Tesa who was previously a pastor
[1:13:43] in the Pentecostal was also there uh but
[1:13:46] all these brothers needed help because
[1:13:47] they were all new to the message and so
[1:13:49] we did not seem to have a pastor of the
[1:13:52] place and um at that time God now moved
[1:13:56] on you and to now go to hawasa so I
[1:14:02] wanted to give the people this kind of
[1:14:05] uh little perspective on why haasa that
[1:14:07] is true there was already need and then
[1:14:09] God began moving on you I even never
[1:14:11] knew that God was moving on your heart
[1:14:12] to go to aasa amen but you went to haasa
[1:14:15] that's true against all ODS that's true
[1:14:18] so you arri in aasa so as soon as I ared
[1:14:22] in in in aasa it was just a suitcase and
[1:14:26] inside was a Bible and inside some some
[1:14:28] few Taps so as soon as I
[1:14:33] reach I am taking a coffee at one place
[1:14:36] I want to C down first I want to see
[1:14:38] what's
[1:14:39] happening
[1:14:41] um but before I go my had my wife had a
[1:14:45] very big intention in aasa she she just
[1:14:48] loves it so much and she wants to she
[1:14:50] admires it so much before so now I come
[1:14:53] down I want her to have a couple of
[1:14:55] coffee and the guy sitting in front of
[1:14:59] me told me it is very late you supposed
[1:15:03] to have a pension a guest house before
[1:15:05] you
[1:15:06] sleep and he I told him I'm just coming
[1:15:09] by the leadership of the Lord and I
[1:15:10] don't know what he's going to do and he
[1:15:12] told me I have one room for you where
[1:15:15] you can sleep yes so he provided for me
[1:15:18] a
[1:15:19] room I thought I was going to pay for
[1:15:22] that room each day but he told me this
[1:15:23] is just a rental house you can just
[1:15:26] sleep on it until you feel to move on so
[1:15:29] he opened the door for me and that time
[1:15:33] is where the Lord spoke to him for me to
[1:15:37] have my first home there mhm so that is
[1:15:41] where everything started actually it was
[1:15:43] not just for one day or two day I spent
[1:15:46] there for8 months my God yes and I
[1:15:49] remember well the only thing I I I did
[1:15:51] not know ah as God sent him there I
[1:15:54] didn't I wasn't even sure but I told you
[1:15:56] if God has sent you if you feel God is
[1:16:00] leading you to go there then I'm behind
[1:16:02] you but I didn't even know what you were
[1:16:05] going to do there I didn't even know
[1:16:07] what God would do and if God sends you
[1:16:10] then the devil has to challenge you so
[1:16:11] you can be sure God sent you that's true
[1:16:13] then you shared this testimony with me
[1:16:15] that I felt was quite moving and our
[1:16:16] viewers would want to hear that then
[1:16:18] this woman comes to you please share
[1:16:20] that testimony of that woman that came
[1:16:22] to threaten you when you arrived in aasa
[1:16:25] uh actually that one was a prophet oh
[1:16:28] she was a prophetess uh the there is two
[1:16:31] people okay the number one is a prophet
[1:16:35] he told me if you don't go out of
[1:16:38] aasa I think he gave me a week he told
[1:16:42] me in a week if you're not going out
[1:16:44] you're going to die in a very hard
[1:16:47] disease so that say the Lord you should
[1:16:50] go out so
[1:16:52] now I'm at my home Counting the
[1:16:56] days one day two days now it's going to
[1:16:59] be my last day in AA what am I going to
[1:17:01] do so that day reach and I don't even
[1:17:05] count the because I was counting all the
[1:17:08] dates but when it left me just one day I
[1:17:12] just forgot what for I was so busy I was
[1:17:15] in touch with another people and I found
[1:17:17] you very busy doing what God told you to
[1:17:18] do that that's right and I found out
[1:17:21] that that time has passed after one
[1:17:24] month I didn't to know what he was
[1:17:25] spoken about yes and I think that's
[1:17:27] where now you shared it with me that's
[1:17:29] right one month after the due Deb of the
[1:17:32] devil has passed that's right oh let me
[1:17:34] tell our viewers some of you the devil
[1:17:36] has given you a due date that's not
[1:17:38] going to happen in the name of our Lord
[1:17:39] Jesus Christ amen my my my my my my and
[1:17:42] the second thing was there is an old
[1:17:45] lady I mean she was not normal she
[1:17:48] didn't dress uh no more dress um she was
[1:17:51] having a bit of uh awkwardness and
[1:17:54] abnormal more she told me this m she
[1:17:57] just appears and told me you only you
[1:18:02] you're going to have some Vindication in
[1:18:04] your house number one she said all the
[1:18:07] things you need in the house is going to
[1:18:08] be needed that you needed the Lord will
[1:18:11] provide for you MH and number two God
[1:18:13] will give you an Open Door mhm that's
[1:18:16] right and number three God will provide
[1:18:19] for you what you needed in that compound
[1:18:22] so it turns out to be before you make a
[1:18:25] decision in your life it is so important
[1:18:28] to know the will of God I didn't I
[1:18:31] didn't just accept what you was saying I
[1:18:34] said but as soon as I went back home a
[1:18:37] connection happened where someone wants
[1:18:39] to give me his his his all his all
[1:18:42] materials in the house he put it in my
[1:18:44] house and he left just appeared let me
[1:18:48] tell you a prophet would tell us that
[1:18:50] the will of God will not take you where
[1:18:55] he will not provide for you if it's the
[1:18:57] will of God he it will take you where
[1:19:00] his grace will prevail and where he will
[1:19:03] provide that's right if he wants you to
[1:19:05] if it's the will of God how do you know
[1:19:06] it is the will of God if he sends you at
[1:19:08] at some place he will provide for you he
[1:19:11] will be with you you won't go pushing
[1:19:13] the door open that's right he will open
[1:19:15] the door and then he will go through it
[1:19:17] that's how you are able to know that God
[1:19:18] has sent you to some place that's right
[1:19:20] would you allow me to read some quotes
[1:19:22] please go ahead um in the mage is trying
[1:19:25] to do God a service without his will
[1:19:27] paragraph 55 it talks about how
[1:19:31] important this is very serious how
[1:19:34] important to know it's the will of God
[1:19:37] yes and here it says no matter how much
[1:19:41] it's needed how much everybody agrees
[1:19:45] that it's needed how much that it is
[1:19:48] true there is yet one thing to find out
[1:19:52] you know he make sure he emphasize many
[1:19:55] people could agree with it it could be
[1:19:58] very needful and people have agreed on
[1:20:01] that basis and it says here there is yet
[1:20:04] one thing to find out exactly is that
[1:20:08] the will of God yes and here it is it is
[1:20:12] showing us it is necessary for the
[1:20:15] people not only in the ministry side
[1:20:17] also in your life in your schools in the
[1:20:20] small decision you take it is so crucial
[1:20:23] to know if it is a will of God yes it is
[1:20:26] important to know the will of God and um
[1:20:29] our generation uh today has a a big
[1:20:33] weakness of not inquiring from God you
[1:20:36] know we do things because we are excited
[1:20:39] we do things because we feel like we we
[1:20:41] are the right people to do it or we feel
[1:20:42] like yeah it's the right time it's the
[1:20:44] you know but we've not inquired from the
[1:20:46] Lord that's right and this is a very
[1:20:48] sobering Court no matter how it is
[1:20:50] needed no matter how many people agree
[1:20:52] with you you must ensure it is the will
[1:20:54] of God and you did it was the will of
[1:20:56] God not not because you followed your
[1:20:58] mother or because someone came and
[1:20:59] prophesied over you we believe in
[1:21:02] prophecies yes but we also believe in
[1:21:04] making sure that it is God the will of
[1:21:06] God Amen so you you you are there 100%
[1:21:09] assured that it is the will of God Amen
[1:21:12] and so you you are you used to send me
[1:21:14] testimonies of how many people would
[1:21:16] believe almost on a weekly basis
[1:21:18] baptizing people people would be added
[1:21:19] to the church and and you are really
[1:21:22] busy you are really busy
[1:21:25] um you see things things start to happen
[1:21:29] naturally slowly at The First beginning
[1:21:32] of few few months it was very difficult
[1:21:35] you don't know people you don't know
[1:21:37] whom to talk to things like that yes but
[1:21:40] slowly it is when after two years or one
[1:21:44] years that I realize those moments I had
[1:21:48] was it is God operating in our as
[1:21:50] something because he was making sure who
[1:21:53] is going to believe who's not going to
[1:21:55] believe who's going to receive it and
[1:21:57] who's not going to receive so he was
[1:21:59] making a connection he was making a
[1:22:01] connection which are Divine connection
[1:22:04] for specific a Divine assignment
[1:22:07] Hallelujah and I was just waiting for
[1:22:09] that moment to come hallelujah amen my
[1:22:12] my my have you met that woman who gave
[1:22:15] you that prophecy again never she
[1:22:17] disappeared well that's what happens
[1:22:20] they never read about such people again
[1:22:23] but we can continue reading in the book
[1:22:26] of Acts about what God is doing through
[1:22:28] your ministry there amen because uh
[1:22:31] Prophet would say that the church we
[1:22:34] would be the continuation of the book of
[1:22:36] Acts that is true so what the Holy
[1:22:38] Spirit did then he is still doing today
[1:22:40] and he's going is's going to continue
[1:22:42] doing and so you were in you how long
[1:22:45] have you been in aasa now I have stayed
[1:22:48] for two years now two years yes um and
[1:22:52] uh during this time you were you were
[1:22:55] helping the church and yes working hand
[1:22:57] in hand with brother mores cuz I know
[1:22:59] he's also taking care of the church
[1:23:01] there together with brother Tesa brother
[1:23:04] um tesan brother tesan who recently went
[1:23:07] abroad yes and brother deesa brother
[1:23:09] Dees yes and uh the the ministry in Adis
[1:23:13] Ababa but there's been a ton of events
[1:23:15] recently that is true where God has uh
[1:23:18] giv you more open doors that is true can
[1:23:21] you please tell us about that uh you see
[1:23:25] um it is very good to be open for the
[1:23:29] leadership of the Lord because he works
[1:23:32] not in our own ways he works things that
[1:23:36] has never been done before so it is very
[1:23:41] crucial and again I want to emphasize on
[1:23:43] it it's very crucial to know again the
[1:23:45] will of God yes uh because
[1:23:48] David knows the will of God but he has a
[1:23:51] good intention he has a good burden to
[1:23:54] me minister to help the Lord to to but
[1:23:57] it was not the right will it didn't mean
[1:23:59] it's not it's not bad or he's he's a bad
[1:24:02] person he was a good person but it was
[1:24:05] out of the will of God so now it came a
[1:24:10] time where I was I was sleeping in the
[1:24:13] bed and I was looking through my phone
[1:24:17] but something
[1:24:19] appeared as if I'm somewhere in that
[1:24:23] place
[1:24:24] is a hotel and it's 10 minutes away from
[1:24:29] from aasa so that
[1:24:32] hotel I I failed to see that hotel but
[1:24:37] inside there is a lot of people
[1:24:39] worshiping but outside it's a hotel
[1:24:41] inside there are people worshiping so I
[1:24:44] I wanted to know why I saw this vision
[1:24:47] and I start praying about it and nothing
[1:24:49] happened I prayed nothing happened but
[1:24:52] in my heart there is some specific day
[1:24:55] that I was longing for to go to that
[1:24:58] place it was Tuesday at 8 8 in the
[1:25:01] morning I dressed up and I go to that
[1:25:04] place and already a person who is the
[1:25:07] owner of the hotel will go to will be
[1:25:10] waiting for me in that right time
[1:25:13] because he had a received a vision that
[1:25:16] a person will come M this day this hour
[1:25:21] in this minute and you shall hand home
[1:25:24] over you keiss to him the keys for the
[1:25:27] hotel mhm so when I stood up it was
[1:25:31] exactly what I saw I went there not
[1:25:35] knowing it's going to be 8 or 3 I just
[1:25:38] appeared to be there at 8 m a.m. I was
[1:25:42] there already so he came and he told me
[1:25:45] are you the minister are you the one and
[1:25:48] I told him what do you mean he told me
[1:25:50] are you a yes I told him I'm a please
[1:25:53] take care of the keys this is what the
[1:25:56] Lord has given you please nourish it and
[1:25:59] whatever you want to minister here do
[1:26:01] what the Lord like leads you to do so
[1:26:05] for me I have to go to another place and
[1:26:08] do my own own work so he gave me the
[1:26:10] case I was still trying to process what
[1:26:13] is still going on because it was too
[1:26:15] quick too fast and things are just
[1:26:18] happening so he told me if you need
[1:26:21] anything just call me I'll be here for
[1:26:23] you
[1:26:24] so that moment was so special to me I
[1:26:27] said Lord you have brought me to this
[1:26:29] place and inside I don't know what you
[1:26:33] wanted to do for this so I just took a
[1:26:35] knee in the hotel I told I told God if
[1:26:38] you are the one who led me here prove to
[1:26:41] me that you are here and a a widow
[1:26:45] running come up to me and she she said
[1:26:49] are you a minister and I told yes I'm a
[1:26:51] minister of the gospel and she said okay
[1:26:54] I feel the Lord guiding me here and if
[1:26:57] you start to worship what time do you
[1:26:58] worship what date and I told well I just
[1:27:01] came here
[1:27:02] today so from Wednesday and Friday and
[1:27:06] Saturday we shall Worship the Lord and
[1:27:08] she start coming from Wednesday and

[1:27:26] start bringing her her her neighbors she
[1:27:29] start bring and she told me I want you
[1:27:32] to introduce this message to my
[1:27:36] daughter so she has two daughters and
[1:27:39] one of them was about to get married and
[1:27:43] other one is in school so I witnessed to
[1:27:45] her she said I have been waiting for
[1:27:49] this truth to be revealed but I will
[1:27:51] just sit and wait upon the Lord to do

[1:28:13] hearing and at the day continues people
[1:28:16] start coming start coming and it sh it
[1:28:19] we we said let us have some ministers
[1:28:21] with us who could help us and most of
[1:28:24] the church their elders and the their
[1:28:27] their their mothers and their aged
[1:28:30] people coming now to the message of the

[1:28:40] two people got saved praise the Lord and
[1:28:42] they came to the to the message of the
[1:28:44] hour literally a church started CH of
[1:28:49] divine leadership out of divine
[1:28:52] leadership how many sords do you have
[1:28:53] there we have there over 45 people
[1:28:57] praise the Lord can can I have a picture
[1:28:59] of that brother brother Isaac I think we
[1:29:00] have several pictures of of the church
[1:29:02] in
[1:29:03] Abella um if you could share the
[1:29:05] pictures with the viewers that that
[1:29:06] would be wonderful I mean I just saw it
[1:29:08] and I was
[1:29:09] flabbergasted I was just moved there is
[1:29:13] uh
[1:29:13] this this one with the
[1:29:16] people and and a little video yeah yeah
[1:29:19] that's that's the one and then there's
[1:29:21] another one a little video as well as
[1:29:24] the one
[1:29:26] inside uh it's amazing I mean what God
[1:29:30] is doing there what and even how the
[1:29:32] whole thing started amen do you know how
[1:29:34] we came to
[1:29:35] Ethiopia I was
[1:29:37] praying for 3
[1:29:40] years because God had been showing me
[1:29:42] scriptures each time about Ethiopia and
[1:29:46] a desire was a desire progressed from a
[1:29:50] desire to a burden and then from a
[1:29:53] burden to um you know really that Zeal
[1:29:57] of wanting to go to see what the Lord
[1:29:59] wanted us to do there we didn't have any
[1:30:01] contact we didn't have any money to go
[1:30:04] um we had just gotten married with my
[1:30:06] wife um but God sent a brother who he
[1:30:10] instructed to give us money to go and
[1:30:12] then also God sent a brother who we did
[1:30:16] not know when we had the money to go all
[1:30:19] the way from Kenya called me gave me a
[1:30:22] contact uh he said that I have an
[1:30:25] Ethiopians here who would like to hear
[1:30:28] this message and I've preached to them
[1:30:30] theyve accepted but when I went to
[1:30:33] baptize them before I could baptize them
[1:30:35] I was on the website and I saw your
[1:30:37] picture meaning my picture I had a
[1:30:39] website then called the youth message
[1:30:40] site and uh he said that the Holy Spirit
[1:30:43] led him to to invite me to come and be
[1:30:46] the one to baptize those people so when
[1:30:48] we went to Nairobi with my wife baptized
[1:30:50] this Ethiopian uh man and um and then he
[1:30:55] gave me a contact this is the one I
[1:30:57] spoke about in the beginning and the
[1:31:00] rest is history and that was the
[1:31:01] beginning of the whole work divine
[1:31:04] intervention Divine leadership and and I
[1:31:08] see the same Trend
[1:31:11] continuing you know what I see in this
[1:31:13] brother Ephraim I don't even see men or
[1:31:15] vessels that God is using I see God
[1:31:19] behind this message it is hard to say I
[1:31:22] have done this it's impossible for a man
[1:31:25] to do this impossible it is impossible
[1:31:27] it is impossible I mean friends I want
[1:31:30] you to understand when we share such
[1:31:33] testimonies we are not trying to lift up
[1:31:35] a man or another man or the other we are
[1:31:38] trying to impress it upon your hearts
[1:31:41] and Upon Our Generation we need to
[1:31:43] document these things for them for the
[1:31:45] people to know that the message we hold
[1:31:48] dear the message we hold dear to ours
[1:31:49] the message we are propagating the
[1:31:51] message we are leaving for people men
[1:31:53] have deed to leave everything you know
[1:31:56] personally when I received this message
[1:31:57] I decided to leave everything and leave
[1:31:58] for this message you have done pretty
[1:32:01] much the same thing many have done the
[1:32:03] same thing men like brother Eddie Bisal
[1:32:05] who has been my mentor for many years he
[1:32:08] did the same thing he gave up everything
[1:32:10] for this message men like pedig and many
[1:32:13] more if the Lord terries for what to
[1:32:18] advertise the name William brandham to
[1:32:20] to talk about a man born in Kentucky and
[1:32:23] things like that
[1:32:24] it is about God calling a generation to
[1:32:28] a message that is going to prepare them
[1:32:30] for the coming of the Lord and these
[1:32:32] things come to show that God is behind
[1:32:34] this message it is not a work of a man
[1:32:37] it is a work of God and we are 100% sure
[1:32:41] and a man would want to be 100% sure
[1:32:43] before they even went out to preach or
[1:32:45] on the street to preach or on the behind
[1:32:47] a pull pit to preach they would want to
[1:32:48] be 100% sure God is with them amen one
[1:32:52] thing we are sure about is that this
[1:32:53] message is Vindicated we don't need to
[1:32:55] vindicate it amen I don't need to
[1:32:57] reproduce the peill of fire that the pel
[1:32:58] of fire to be on my head and show the
[1:32:59] people that look I have a peel of fire
[1:33:01] this message is already Vindicated the
[1:33:03] PE of fire was already here it is
[1:33:05] already here but you know it has already
[1:33:08] come and Vindicated the prophet of
[1:33:10] Malachi 4 and you know the the the the
[1:33:13] sign in the hand the designment of the
[1:33:16] people's hearts and all these things and
[1:33:17] the truth of the message to vindicate
[1:33:20] that this message is the truth God
[1:33:22] himself has confirmed that and I to use
[1:33:24] that word Vindication because we when we
[1:33:28] take out this Vindicator message to the
[1:33:31] souls we don't make them to be a message
[1:33:34] believers they have already a message
[1:33:37] believers they don't know it they don't
[1:33:40] so when the Vindicated truth come to it
[1:33:44] it will tell them where they were and
[1:33:46] who they are yes so this Vindicated
[1:33:48] truth will reveal to them who they are
[1:33:51] exactly and they will know they are the
[1:33:52] bride of Christ and let me tell you
[1:33:56] this ethopia will have a special bride
[1:34:01] of Christ amen she will have a special
[1:34:03] bride of Christ and I felt so much the
[1:34:06] burden of my father and makes me so
[1:34:09] responsible it will not make me proud or
[1:34:11] things like it will make me more
[1:34:13] responsible for what's happening in
[1:34:15] Ethiopia so I will tell you this ethopia
[1:34:18] will have a special and a unique bride
[1:34:21] which will manifest the spirit of God
[1:34:23] amen amen that's what we want we don't
[1:34:26] want to I mean we're tired of the
[1:34:28] politics we're tired of the church
[1:34:30] politics we are tired of uh the me I I
[1:34:34] we want to see God being made manifest
[1:34:37] in our ministry in our life in the
[1:34:40] people after all this is the only way we
[1:34:42] can people can be able to know that we
[1:34:44] are his disciples if we have love one
[1:34:46] for the other but God is love and if God
[1:34:48] is in us then he's going to manifest his
[1:34:50] power that's right yes and um
[1:34:54] I'm speechless brother brother amen yeah
[1:34:56] I'm just a little bit emotional about
[1:34:58] this whole thing you know God just
[1:34:59] coming down to vindicate and to prove
[1:35:02] that I'm here I'm leading I'm guiding
[1:35:04] I'm what more do we want to know that
[1:35:07] the message is really true that's true
[1:35:09] and so you've also continued to reach
[1:35:11] out and U I remember you sent me a
[1:35:14] picture of this church in Abella the
[1:35:16] first when you you you had gotten the
[1:35:18] place and it was empty there yeah it was
[1:35:20] empty but then these people came and
[1:35:22] brought the bench
[1:35:24] that's true by by themselves that's true
[1:35:27] my God because you see uh yes we need
[1:35:31] money for the ministry but money is not
[1:35:34] the absolute yes
[1:35:37] so when people were coming in they
[1:35:39] didn't have space to sit yes they were
[1:35:42] just sitting on the floor so yes I just
[1:35:45] failed to say this with a humility and
[1:35:47] respect I told them well if you are what
[1:35:51] you are hearing is blessing you then you
[1:35:54] can provide a chair for yourself so
[1:35:56] actually I didn't know what I meant but
[1:35:58] the next service they bought a chair
[1:36:00] from their house my God and they say we
[1:36:03] have dedicated this CH this chair for
[1:36:05] the for the Lord Brother Isaac do you
[1:36:06] have the video ready yes please play the
[1:36:09] video they just brought the chairs and
[1:36:12] everything from their houses from their
[1:36:13] house yes and it was a miracle you know
[1:36:17] and I want to say they are very
[1:36:20] prayerful people m you know the days of
[1:36:24] barrier where whatever Paul was speaking
[1:36:28] they don't accept it they go back and
[1:36:30] study it with if it is true or not yes
[1:36:34] and this these people their special
[1:36:36] weapon is
[1:36:38] prayer they able to sense the spirit of
[1:36:41] God and be so sensitive to to the things
[1:36:43] you are saying and align it with the
[1:36:45] word and I would like to say a
[1:36:49] Ministry that we work without prayer
[1:36:53] will be man's work exactly but the
[1:36:55] ministry Hallelujah that we work with
[1:36:58] prayer will be God's work Hallelujah
[1:37:01] there is nothing a man will say I have
[1:37:03] done this it will just take everything
[1:37:05] to the Lord that's right actually all
[1:37:08] the glory goes back to God Amen there is
[1:37:10] um these other places you you keep going
[1:37:12] back to the Pentecostals One Pastor
[1:37:14] leads you to another yes and uh there's
[1:37:17] this picture you shared um maybe brother
[1:37:19] Isaac can as well share it of this large
[1:37:22] uh group you were meeting uh how many
[1:37:24] did you esate to be there you see I I
[1:37:27] just didn't appear to be there I I met a
[1:37:31] person that that was a
[1:37:34] pastor and uh this pastor was not fully
[1:37:38] believing the message by then but he was
[1:37:41] led by God to tell me that I need you to
[1:37:44] go to this church there will be a
[1:37:46] conference I need you to minister to
[1:37:48] them so I'll usually go with the track
[1:37:50] and with the book after I preach I will
[1:37:52] I will give about the books and things
[1:37:54] like that so this picture was taken when
[1:37:57] I was going to the conference yes and I
[1:38:00] believe the Lord is doing a mighty a
[1:38:03] mighty work in the south in the North in
[1:38:06] the East part of Ethiopia yes amen and
[1:38:09] so you kind of now also Minister among
[1:38:12] these um if you can enlarge that a
[1:38:13] little bit brother Isaac to you reach
[1:38:16] out to these um Pentecostals as well one
[1:38:19] Pastor leading to another this is just
[1:38:22] amazing
[1:38:24] uh and then this testimony that we
[1:38:25] shared recently in church also moved me
[1:38:28] I know we we by the way few viewers we
[1:38:31] never prepare to talk this or that we we
[1:38:32] just wanted to just have a conversation
[1:38:34] cuz I mean while I was sharing with
[1:38:36] ephra he had too much and I was like no
[1:38:38] people need to hear it that to hear all
[1:38:41] these things amen and so this testimony
[1:38:43] that moved me as well of uh how did you
[1:38:46] meet that pastor Pastor H okay I was
[1:38:50] invited a conference at chashan mhm I
[1:38:54] was told there will be a a pastor a
[1:38:58] Revenant who is going to come and preach
[1:39:02] so I sat down and I listen to his someon
[1:39:05] preach that is the first time meeting
[1:39:08] him so he preach a sermon but the host
[1:39:12] will bring me to to say a Thanksgiving

[1:39:19] after I I said some few words and I I
[1:39:22] prayed and we Clos the program so they
[1:39:24] allowed me to sit next to him okay so

[1:40:11] books for him to read on the phones so
[1:40:14] he kept reading it and he said after 3
[1:40:18] months he had planned a meeting for me
[1:40:22] to sit with him and have a discussion

[1:41:13] again it tookes another two two months
[1:41:15] to come and meet this man and he gave me
[1:41:19] different ideologies that he was having
[1:41:21] he was bringing with a different
[1:41:23] question
[1:41:23] what the internet says what the other
[1:41:26] people says and things like that and I
[1:41:28] told him don't listen listen to the
[1:41:32] message mhm and what I did is I just
[1:41:34] directed him to the message so he he's
[1:41:37] good at reading he keeps reading he
[1:41:39] keeps reading and
[1:41:42] finally he came up to me and he said
[1:41:45] because I'll be here and there I need
[1:41:47] you to give me a contact of who who
[1:41:49] brought you to this message who who who

[1:41:59] me his contact No No I gave him your
[1:42:02] contact and I didn't told you by then

[1:42:09] not call you or you know he's he's at
[1:42:11] diseas
[1:42:13] so there was time that he was listening
[1:42:16] to the sermons that been preached here
[1:42:19] that I didn't know about yeah so he was
[1:42:22] keeping listening live yeah he was
[1:42:24] streaming live and I was tired at home I
[1:42:30] came home planning to rest and sleep
[1:42:32] yeah so as I was laying down he calls me
[1:42:35] and he said uh do you remember that day
[1:42:38] you told me you you you can baptize me
[1:42:41] any time any place anywhere and I said
[1:42:44] yes yes I remember that time and he said
[1:42:47] I want to be baptized now praise the
[1:42:49] Lord and I told him you see now it's
[1:42:51] it's very late and people are going to
[1:42:53] sleep and it's dark he said no no I want
[1:42:56] to be baptized now and I told him okay
[1:42:59] there is no transport now it's far from
[1:43:01] me to your home he told me I'm at your
[1:43:04] gate right now my goodness he usually
[1:43:06] comes home to take out books yes so that
[1:43:09] was Wednesday night that was Wednesday
[1:43:12] night yes it is around 40 9 you mean 10
[1:43:18] 10 10 p.m. p.m. that is where he was
[1:43:20] baptized and he went out quickly and and
[1:43:23] um he sent this message I read it for
[1:43:25] the people here in the church I mean I
[1:43:26] was amazed this just blew my mind and he
[1:43:30] said he he that service uh he was
[1:43:34] streaming he commented he didn't send
[1:43:36] this to me directly but he commented it
[1:43:38] on the YouTube so I usually receive
[1:43:40] these notifications that people comment
[1:43:42] on YouTube so he commented and said
[1:43:45] Shalom greetings to the Saints and you
[1:43:47] Pastor my name is Pastor H and he
[1:43:50] mentions the church where he comes from
[1:43:51] in aasa he say Pastor Ephraim Abdu
[1:43:54] introduced me to this present truth of
[1:43:56] the hour amen you could tell that he has
[1:43:58] really got a good grip on this and he
[1:44:00] says the last time I went to his church
[1:44:02] at Abella which is the church we've been
[1:44:04] talking about and so he mentioned you as
[1:44:08] his uh mentor and after a while I keep
[1:44:12] after a while I kept following your
[1:44:14] channel so this is my sixth time my
[1:44:18] sixth time listening to the sermons
[1:44:20] preached I have seen God in this message
[1:44:23] and you know I told the people that
[1:44:25] moved me that I have seen God in this
[1:44:28] message not I've seen how powerful you
[1:44:31] are how great you are but I've seen God
[1:44:33] in this message I just feel like crying
[1:44:35] when I see that when I hear someone
[1:44:37] testify like that because the purpose
[1:44:39] the reason why we preach Ephraim is to
[1:44:42] the for the people to have a direct
[1:44:44] relationship with Jesus Christ not for
[1:44:47] for us to front ourselves but for the
[1:44:49] people to see Christ in us and so he
[1:44:51] says I have seen God in this message and
[1:44:54] now I have given all my all to him and
[1:44:58] he says I now have decided to accept
[1:45:00] what baptism I will call Pastor Ephraim
[1:45:03] Abdu
[1:45:04] now and he says what can hinder me from
[1:45:07] water baptism fire fire come again and
[1:45:10] take my side oh my God I was just moved
[1:45:13] and by the time I sent you this you just
[1:45:16] said I'm from baptizing
[1:45:18] him oh my I think this to me it just
[1:45:21] finished me amen my God am amen so um
[1:45:26] and and I'm sure there are going to be
[1:45:28] many more cuz this is a bishop this is a
[1:45:30] bishop that's right he has many churches
[1:45:32] behind him if he has been convinced of
[1:45:34] the truth no doubt he is going to be
[1:45:37] concerned about taking this truth that
[1:45:38] is true all over this area that is true
[1:45:41] and uh tell us a little more about what
[1:45:44] is happening there are there other
[1:45:45] churches other places starting up now
[1:45:48] the Revival is going to begin H it's
[1:45:51] going to start you know the prophet says
[1:45:54] the Revival starts from the hearts yes
[1:45:57] start from out inside to the outside yes
[1:45:59] so people are dedicating their lives now
[1:46:03] to read the books yes that has been
[1:46:05] translated and to listen what and by the
[1:46:09] way people should know that you are also
[1:46:11] a translator of the message yes I
[1:46:13] remember the first time I heard you
[1:46:15] translate uh some people thought I was
[1:46:18] being um I was doing something wrong
[1:46:21] because you were young and oh he's young
[1:46:23] he doesn't know the message so deep and
[1:46:26] you know and you know but it turned out
[1:46:29] you're one of the best
[1:46:30] translators amen amen I I appreciate
[1:46:33] that have people people there are two
[1:46:38] kind of people people that see where
[1:46:41] you're going and what potential you have
[1:46:44] and the second people they will see it
[1:46:46] when you
[1:46:47] accomplish and there's people who see it
[1:46:50] before that thing happen so I I thank
[1:46:53] God for for it so right now in Ethiopia
[1:46:57] what is taking place is the ministers
[1:46:59] are are packing themselves now to give
[1:47:03] what the message is to to to to know
[1:47:05] them you you know now we are in in the
[1:47:07] phases of telling them there is a
[1:47:10] difference and they have known the
[1:47:11] difference and now it is time for them
[1:47:14] to know what the difference is yeah and
[1:47:17] to stabilize themselves in the message
[1:47:19] now that's where we're going right now
[1:47:22] well um it would not be good to finish
[1:47:26] this interview without making a comment
[1:47:28] about the efforts of our brothers in
[1:47:30] clal and message hub for supporting
[1:47:33] translation uh because they have also uh
[1:47:36] supported the translation of the message
[1:47:39] uh in Amharic in in um also oromia and
[1:47:45] uh I think the church Ed book is
[1:47:47] concluded also Somali in inar is that is
[1:47:50] that started yet Somali has started oh
[1:47:52] wonderful yes so you can see that this
[1:47:54] they've really dedicated themselves to
[1:47:56] do that and that is really the vision of
[1:47:57] brother bisco amen and uh they've done a
[1:48:00] good work in that and regarding your
[1:48:02] ministry of course our viewers you need
[1:48:05] to understand that brother Ephraim is
[1:48:08] not a theologian is someone as you heard
[1:48:11] called of God and he's educated you are
[1:48:14] educated you you have a bachelor's
[1:48:15] degree but he decided to fully go into
[1:48:17] Ministry I never asked him to God asked
[1:48:20] him to it was a personal revelation
[1:48:23] um yes I always want young people to go
[1:48:26] into Ministry but I never push anybody
[1:48:27] into Ministry or ask anybody to go into
[1:48:29] Ministry uh it has to be a calling they
[1:48:32] have to be sure and as you can hear him
[1:48:34] speak he's mature he knows what he's
[1:48:36] talking about he's fed on the message
[1:48:38] and I know God has been supplying buten
[1:48:41] somebody could be listening and they
[1:48:43] just all of the sudden receive a burden
[1:48:46] to support the work there I think
[1:48:47] they're welcome to do that because
[1:48:49] there's much to do there's much needed
[1:48:52] there's much to do but the resources uh
[1:48:55] are from as many as God gives a burden
[1:48:58] uh to to uh to support the work of God
[1:49:00] in the ministry and uh I know that the
[1:49:04] god that has been supplying and the god
[1:49:06] that sent you there will continue to
[1:49:09] supply he he's always faithful he's
[1:49:11] always more than able he has he's
[1:49:13] unquenchable he he's he's more than
[1:49:16] enough and so uh um how is the the
[1:49:20] church in aasa the the main Church now
[1:49:23] Ina it's been it's been a blessing
[1:49:26] because we have uh now a new Minister
[1:49:29] there he's uh called uh brother Elias
[1:49:34] okay uh ACC compined with brother Dera
[1:49:38] and brother Tes yes they are doing a
[1:49:40] marvelous job there right now they are
[1:49:42] found in building the church yes so they
[1:49:45] are constructing and making sure we have
[1:49:47] the next conference set and ready
[1:49:50] wonderful yes um we have
[1:49:54] uh the message in our country has come
[1:49:58] in the late 70s early 80s so that's
[1:50:02] quite very many years uh in Ethiopia if
[1:50:05] we count from 2013 it's just
[1:50:08] barely uh about 11 years yeah 11 years
[1:50:13] 12 years yes and so you can see that the
[1:50:16] message in Ethiopia is quite new and the
[1:50:21] seeds of the message were sold myself
[1:50:25] brother Paul in Nairobi came brother
[1:50:27] Gideon who actually spoke to yesterday
[1:50:28] and is leaving the country he's been
[1:50:30] there for about 13 years and other
[1:50:32] brothers they've really helped and the
[1:50:34] work of God has you know the seed of the
[1:50:36] message has been sold in the country
[1:50:37] true uh but now I think in most of the
[1:50:40] regions where that that seed was planted
[1:50:42] they're sprouting out and you were on
[1:50:47] another phase now like you said a
[1:50:48] Revival is breaking out and and so some
[1:50:51] of us would just continue to come come
[1:50:52] and encourage uh we are also trying to
[1:50:55] go in the North in in TIG there is a new
[1:50:58] work there but I think the work is still
[1:51:01] a lot we talking about how many million
[1:51:03] people are in Ethiopia 120 million 120
[1:51:06] million plus plus um we have only
[1:51:10] 40 something 45 Millions here for sure
[1:51:13] and we have many Believers for sure so
[1:51:15] in Ethiopia there's still a lot of work
[1:51:18] to do you know what I believe this is my
[1:51:21] private Revelation EOP is one of the
[1:51:23] last countries that will receive the
[1:51:25] message before the Rapture this is my
[1:51:27] private Revelation so so like you said
[1:51:31] that Ethiopia will have a special bride
[1:51:33] I believe that I believe that amen so
[1:51:36] because it's one of the last countries
[1:51:37] to receive this message before the
[1:51:39] Rapture amen and uh it's God is doing it
[1:51:42] is God is doing amen and um so uh is
[1:51:46] there something before we conclude this
[1:51:48] that you would want to maybe tell our
[1:51:51] viewers maybe you look over to that
[1:51:52] camera and say something preach
[1:51:54] something say something whatever it is
[1:51:56] maybe to the younger generation the
[1:51:58] younger ministers whatever you feel to
[1:52:00] say
[1:52:02] um you
[1:52:05] see um God has a
[1:52:10] special uh calling in everyone and
[1:52:14] actually the prophet calls it everyone
[1:52:16] is a
[1:52:17] minister uh we may not turn out to
[1:52:20] preach we may not turn out to stand in
[1:52:22] in the Pulpit we may turn out to be
[1:52:24] behind the pulpit but every person has a
[1:52:28] diff different calling in their lives
[1:52:31] and I want us to to to take that burden
[1:52:35] and to ask the Lord what have you putten
[1:52:37] inside of me what do you want me to
[1:52:40] manifest in the age that you have put in
[1:52:42] me that is very critical and that is
[1:52:45] very blessing thing to know that you are
[1:52:47] set for this so you aside yourself from
[1:52:50] different things and you know where you
[1:52:53] are heading and you know what you're
[1:52:55] doing so I will ask the youth if they
[1:52:58] could find out the biggest problem to is
[1:53:01] to know who we are to understand who we
[1:53:05] are to know what we are working for so
[1:53:08] if they found out yes if they found out
[1:53:11] their purpose and God's plan in their
[1:53:14] life
[1:53:15] yeah that's it yeah amen that that's
[1:53:20] powerful amen that's powerful many
[1:53:22] people are just going to and fro now
[1:53:25] like in Uganda where you have many
[1:53:27] churches they're jumping from one Church
[1:53:28] to the other they never rest never
[1:53:30] settle never sit under a Ministry to
[1:53:32] grow and and how can they find purpose
[1:53:35] that is true but I think to find purpose
[1:53:36] is a very important thing and usually
[1:53:38] when you do not everyone will agree with
[1:53:40] you many people will disapprove of what
[1:53:43] you're doing that is true someone when I
[1:53:45] was coming to a theer the first time
[1:53:47] they told me uh you're just going to
[1:53:49] fail you're wasting your time but you
[1:53:52] see see uh if it is God it cannot fail
[1:53:55] because God is the one who reveals your
[1:53:58] purpose and when he does reveal it it
[1:54:00] cannot fail that is true and and so uh
[1:54:03] uh now um after a few years of your
[1:54:07] marriage your wife is now fully going to
[1:54:09] join you I'm sure you you are going to
[1:54:12] be better prepared to go on the fields
[1:54:14] and to do whatever it is that you have
[1:54:15] to do and cuz you now have her support
[1:54:19] as a wife as well as um a prayer partner
[1:54:22] and
[1:54:23] so we are just praying God's blessings
[1:54:25] over you and over her we already prayed
