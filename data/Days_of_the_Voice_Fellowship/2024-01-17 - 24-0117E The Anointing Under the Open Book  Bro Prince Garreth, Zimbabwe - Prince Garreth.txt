not look at our sins and our errors Lord because if you would look at our sins and our errors Lord none would be here for we were all born in in sin and Sh in iniquity but Lord you provided the blood of the lamb for the remission of our sins that's why the singer of a song wrote and S that you looked beyond my fault and saw my need heavenly father now we are gathered into thy presence we are gathered as children Jehovah On th table to Feast of Thy word Jehovah for we believe in the preaching of the Gospel that casts out devils that sets the Bound free that raises the dead that heal the sick oh Heavenly Father what a privilege it is to be in your presence this evening Lord we are not worthy but you loved us anyhow Lord hide me behind the cross that I may never be seen but that you minister to your children because you will not bless my words and nothing that I can say that can change their lives but you are the father of spirits the bishop of souls you alone can minister to their hearts Lord I'm not from around here I don't know the problems that they going through but the Great Eagle is in the camp the one who sees the intense and desires of the hearts Lord Minister yourself to their hearts we thank you tonight Lord for the preaching of the word we thank you Heavenly Father for the sacrifices that have been made for every soul that is here Lord as they are under great expectation we no expectation is the breeding ground for the miraculous give unto each and everyone the desires of their hearts in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord how many are happy to be here hallelujah my brother my sister if you really knew who you were who you are in the eyes of God not in the eyes of the person sitting next to you because each and every person has got an idea that they have about another person's life but if you knew what God sees when looks at you you would give a better amen if you knew who you really were you would not be bound by chains of circumstances you would not be bound by chains of tiredness you wouldn't be bound by chains of things things that are bothering you but you would give God a better am because we have seen him as Jehovah Gyra we have seen him as Jehovah Rafa wait tonight you are going to see him as Jehovah God Great and Mighty in battle because when he revealed himself as Jehovah Mighty in battle on the children of Israel they sang a new song and M who was caught by the chains of circumstances she took a tambourine and she danced in a way that she had never danced so today when you see God as a mighty deliverer delivering you from your situation you will give a better amen hallelujah praise God how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord if you happy give me a better amen let the redeemed shout hallelujah let the redeemed say so because when you know who God has made you to be that Devils there is not enough devils in hell that can stand before you because you are a superpower because you know who God has called you to be hallelujah praise God You Cee to look at yourself just a little sister you SE to look at yourself just a little brother but you look at yourself as the true embodiment of who God really is hallelujah praise God praise God hallelujah can I have a better amen let the briide of Christ shout hallelujah oh praise God Amen it reminds me in the Book of Joshua when God wanted to deliver the children of Israel he could have told them go with your swords and fight you better sword do not win battles my brother swords of words do not win battles my brother swords of Deceit and deception they do not win battles but there is a better weapon that God G to Joshua and the children of Israel that if they would use that weapon the of Jero would fall this is the weapon that I'm asking you to use tonight when I'm saying let the redeemed say hallelujah that's the weapon of Praise that God told the children of Israel you will March around the city and on the seventh day after you have marched for the seventh time give a shout of praise and the of Jero will fall I tell you tonight if you give God a shot of praise the of Jero in your life they are going to fall hallelujah praise God if you believe it can you give me am hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God amen amen I would like to thank the pastor In Absentia you know it's a really hard thing for a pastor to leave you his pit and when is not around it really means that he really trusts you it really means that he knows that his flock is in safe hands I want to tell you this is my first time standing on the pulpit in church we are used to preaching out there in the streets in the far away places you know how there you can afford to make a mistake because the people out there do not really know what is entailed in this message but here it's a really hard thing to preach to a person who knows Malachi 4 because any simple mistake that you made they are there and they watching you they'll tell you ah brother I think you missed so there's none there's no harder thing than to preach to a Believer but I'm glad that today the Lord will make a way and I respect Pastor T along with my pastor from gu Pastor who trusted me to come here hallelujah praise God I want to tell you of a little story before we get into the word there was a man who stayed in the city he had a lot of money perhaps he was a billionaire so he was used to listening to the to the television and watching the news on the television on France 24 maybe France BBC world but then one day he had to travel to the rural areas but the problem now was that in the rural areas there was no satellite dishes there there was no bbcc there was no France 24 24 there was no CBS News CBS News there wasn't any of that but there was a small radio a very very small radio so one day he was sitting there and an announcement was made on the small radio that please indeed do not drink water from the T for the next one week because there's something there's some poison that is in those TS if you drink you will surely die but now because the men were so used to watching news on on BBC he said what can this small radio tell me a man like me I cannot listen to a small radio like this because it has got nothing to tell me my brother I want to tell you that man drank the water from the T and he surely died what is the moral of the story it's not about the device that is giving you the message it's is not about the preacher standing in the P might be a small radio and you are so used to hearing from BBC News and great and great preachers who push their belly around and I'm just a young man like me but I tell you if you look at the size of the radio and miss the message coming from the radio you will surely die it reminds me of the Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says in the book of Isaiah there was nothing in him that when we would see him we would desire him they were so used to their high priest who had beard that was sweeping the streets you know big shoulders very tall and very dark skinned that when they would speak speak terites would fall but the Lord Jesus Christ came in away like a small radio until even Nathaniel sitting under a tree said what good can come out of nazare but I want to thank God there was a Philip who said I know nael what you think but I won't say something to you the only thing that I'll say to you is come and see my brother just come and see but the Lord is good it is not about the preacher it is about the message that is coming hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah so do not look down on me I might be just a young man but I tell you I know where I've been and I tell you I know who I'm representing when I am standing here I am not afraid of demons I am not going to be afraid of witches because I know who I'm standing for that great mighty king Jehovah Hallelujah so if you're unexpect you are going to hear from theone of God hallelujah praise God without wasting much of your time may we open our Bibles in the Book of Genesis chapter 1 from verse 26 Genesis 1 ver 26 today we are going to read um many scriptures then we will get into the preaching of the word Genesis 1: 26 it says and God said if and go and God said let us make men in our image after our own likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the F of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth verse 27 says so God created men in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he [Music] [Music] them Hallelujah Hallelujah may we also open in the book of Isaiah 6 from verse one Isaiah 60 verse1 6 chapter 60 yes chapter 6 from verse one it says here I Rise and Shine for thy light is come and the glory of God is risen upon thee verse two for Behold The Darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness upon the people but the Lord shall rise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah may we also open in the Book of Revelations so we have read from Genesis which is the beginning the book of je and we have gone to the book of Isaiah which is exactly in the middle of the Bible the book of Isaiah is the Bible is the is the book that is right in the middle of the Bible and we've read from there now we are going to read in the last book of the Bible because God's word is in continuity the prophet says whatever it is that you preach is got to run from Genesis all the way to Revelations hallelujah hallelujah now we'll read in the Book of Revelations chapter 4 from verse one it says after this I looked and behold a door was opened in the heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were a trumpet talking with me which said come up thether come up thether and I will show Thee the things which must be hereafter [Music] read again this is my last scripture before we sit down again the Book of Revelations chap 10 many of us in the message we know this verse this this book we know this chapter it says from verse 1 up to 11 and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open I want you to get this this book was open and he set in his right foot upon the sea and with his left foot upon the Earth and cried with a loud voice as it were a lion Roth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices verse four and when the seven Thunders had uttered their voices I was about to write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which are in those seven Thunders with the seven Thunders uttered and read them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever who created the Heaven and the earth and the things that they're in and the earth and the things that they're in and the Seas and the sea and the things that they in that there should be time no longer verse 7 it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again say go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the face of the Earth and I went to the angel and said give me the book the little book and he said unto me take it and and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey verse 10 and I looked in the little book out of and took the little book out of the hand of the out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and hone and and in my mouth it was in my mouth as sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many peop and the Nations and tongues and Kings amen amen for [Music] [Music] for for hallelujah hallelujah may we please close our eyes and pray precious graciously father once again we come before because there is none like you every man that went to school can open and read from the book but it takes something superatural to come down and R what is written tells us that the letter K but the spirit give will you come down and breathe life this that it might be a living reality hide me behind the cross that I may never be seen just use me as an instrument Lord to speak your thought to these people at the end of this service Lord like John they might prophesy again in the might name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen hallelujah hallelujah we may now take our seats and I'm going to read again from The Book of Revelations CH 4:7 it says here and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast was like a cal and the third Beast had a face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen are you still happy to be in the house of the Lord we have read in the Book of Genesis the Book of Genesis chapter 1 where God says let us make man in our own image after our own after own likeness and I'll ask you a question what is the image of God is it big eyes and big ears is it he very tall or very darkin but the prophet tells us God that God is spirit and God does not have a St because he is a spirit but the image of God was the authority of God that's why he says now and we will give him dominion over all the things upon the face of the Earth which was the image of God that was the likeness of God that God R the heavens and men would rule upon the face of the earth that is the reason why God created men for him to have dominion then I have a question for you I begin to wonder that if God created you to have dominion how come you fail to assume dominion over the smallest of things over even in your classroom at school you do not want to assume a position of power they ask you to be a class monitor you refuse even it's your job when they want you to be uh in charge of a number of people you refuse my question is what manner of men are you from once did you come because a man that was created in the image of God was created to assume power and to take dominion over all the things of the earth when I mean all things I don't mean something I mean all things that means even your financial problems it falls under all things that means the sickness in your body it falls under all things that means a problematic work that means your empty pant home old things you were created and made in the image of God to have dominion and excise authority over all things now in the Book of Genesis chapter 2 we hear that God now created this man and formed Out of the Dust of the earth a body and put the spirit man that he had created in that body and he called them Adam now Adam standing in the image of God on the earth he was a miniature God the prophet tells us that Adam was an extension he was a part of God Adam was a God on the earth that's why Adam would stand and say River flow from the south to the north yes River the water river flow from the south to the North and the rivers would obey because he was standing in the authority that God created to stand that's why Adam would wake up on one day say C the clouds and say clouds come and cover and give us a little bit of shade and a wind from the East must blow in the garden and surely and indeed sure his light is different from the day the wind would come why because Adam was standing in the authority that God had created that was the first specimen God had created he was standing in his position hallelujah praise God but we realize and we know that after some time God took out a rib from Adam and Adam called that woman Eve you see it was in the nature of Adam to even give names to things God would come down one day with an answer sheet hiding it behind his back and God would bring a lion just to see what Adam would call Adam because he was God he was standing in the image of God he was an extension of who God was look at the lion say because when you roll terites from trees fall yes terites from trees [Music] fall because you have a big man because you have a big man you called a lion and God will check his answer sheet and God that would be the name of and God would say amen and God would bring an elephant an elephant would come and God would look at his just to see what Moses would call what what Adam would call and Adam would stand and say because you have big ears gray skin I'm going to call you elephant and God would say Amen because Adam was standing in the image that God created to he was standing in the image of God after the likeness of the Creator he himself could stand and say something God would be his amen somebody say amen hallelujah if you believe it say Amen but after a while the serpent came into the garden of and beged Eve and Adam because he knew that God was going to kill out of the love that he had Adam was not deceived Adam knew exactly what he was doing the prophet tells us that ifam hadn't partaken of the sin that Eve had done was going to die but Adam knew that Eve was an extension of so he in the sin to save his wife now because Adam had done God could not kill Adam because Adam was an extension of who God would have killed Adam God would have killed a part of could not kill hallelujah praise God so when you are sit there you have got to know that you an extension of who God was now the prophet tells us the reason why Adam could stand and say all those things and God will say Amen because Adam a titled did book Adam was given a book of authority Adam was given a secret to the the access of the authority of God after Adam fell he fitted the rights of the book and the devil because he had dirty hands could not get his hand on the book the book had only one thing left to do was to return return to his original who was the Lord Jesus Christ who had given it to Adam in the then we see Adam being chased from the and the lion that Adam would one day walk with a dog putting it on the leash started to hunt him why because he had lostt did book he had lost the right but I want to thank God that even though God had already made a way to bring men back to his former estate that's why the prophet preach the message the restoration of the bright tree now he explains to us what restoration means restoration means to put back where not to take something new but that very thing that was lost and restore it back to its original position hallelujah praise God now came Jesus Christ the second Adam upon the face of the Earth who are standing in the volume of the book that's why Christ one day when the winds and the storms would rise Christ sleeping in the boat he would stand and put his foot on the bridge of the ship and peace be still and the Seas and the winds would obey and the disciples would ask what manner of a man is I tell you the manner of a man it was the second Adam that was upon the face of the Earth it was God's plan men back to his rightful position hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah if you are grateful for the second Adam will give God a better amen now standing on the face of the Earth as a second would stand and look at and little girl rise he would look at J's daughter and say girl rise and immediately she would rise he was standing in the volume of the book he was standing in the image of God and he would say things and God would say amen I want to tell you tonight if you tonight have been put in the body of Christ the Bible says by one Spirit we are baptized into one body which is the body of Christ now if if you are there you are standing as a as a part of Adam you are an eve in this last day and you have the same Authority because the husband and the wife one flesh you and Christ are one flesh you can also stand and your dead situation in your dead situation you can also stand to a situation in your life and God will say Amen why because you have been restored praise God Amen now we read in the Book of Revelation chapter 4 or chapter 5 you hear that after all had been said and Down In Heaven There was a meeting God and His angels and all the saints in everyone else they were sitting there there was and there was one that was seated upon the throne who had a book remember in the Book of Genesis there was once a book but the book returned to it original own now in the Book of Revelations we see that original sitting upon the throne with a book in his hand that was closed the book had been closed when Adam in the book of of Eden open book that why that is why he could exercise the authority of what was in the book but after he lost it the book then was closed it return back to the owner now the owner was sitting on the throne with a closed book in his head and the question was asked who is worthy to come and take the book to look at the book and to lose the and the Bible says there was none found in heav there was none found there was none found who could take the book to look at it and to lose and to lose the SE and John said I weped much why did John weep because he knew that if the book Remain the devil would have authority of God's children and all of creation would be lost hallelujah hallelujah but praise God John says in there I beh is the voice that say we not joh not I'm saying to you tonight not let FL not give for there is one that has been found worthy to take the book The and said Lord I saw a lion the voice said the lion of the tribe of Jud has been found worthy but when he beheld he says I saw a l was slain from the foundations of the world walking in the presence of God and he took the book and when he took the book that's when we realize now in the Book of Revelations that now there was a mighty Angel who is this Mighty Angel the Bible says he had clown and a rainbow the prophet explains what a rainbow means it says a rainbow represent a covenant saw the angel with the Covenant the Tells that isone other than the Lord Jesus Christ he is the Angel of the coven now when that Mighty angel came down from heaven the book was no longer CL it says he had in his right hand an open book when you get to verse five verse you hear that there was another Mighty Angel standing upon the face of the Earth my brother there had to be another Mighty Angel standing upon the face of the Earth who is this Mighty angel now we in the Book of Revelation 1 that God is Seven Stars in his Seven Stars at the seven Messengers all the seven angels to to the seven Church Angels that's why John was told to the angel of the first church write these things to the angel of the second now in the 10th chapter there was an angel standing upon the face of the Earth hallelujah praise God who had his foot one upon the sea one upon the land and his hand was lifted up in the heavens one foot on the sea he was putting all powers that we Under the Sea Under his feet and his right foot on the land he rejecting all power under his feet remember in the Book of Genesis God created man that he should excise and Authority all things now this Mighty Angel Prophet William the seventh angel of this seventh was standing there and he was putting all pow under his foot that's why in the prayer L he would stand say I every spirit and put it under my feet for the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ and one hand was lifted up in heaven the Bible tells us we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and and spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places so why was his hand lifted up he was taking a hold of spiritual wickedness in Heavenly places and he was putting them under subjection because why he was standing in the image that God created to stand hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah if you happy say Amen if you believe this to be the truth will you shout amen oh give God a clip of Hallelujah praise God and now the prophet tells us that John represented the bride and John was told go to the angel that is upon the face of the Earth and take the book that open book remember the message of restoration was now restoring back the man that had fallen from his original state back into his position now John the bride was told go and take the book and eat of the book or study the book meditate upon the book write it upon the tables of heart and after you do that it shall be sweet in th mouth and bitter in th and after you do that prophesy again hallelujah praise God let me tell you tonight this book is not given this book is taken the Bible says from the time of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suff violence and the violence shall take it that is why I have a problem with Christians want everything to be handed down to be handed down to them it was never in the plan of God to just you things you are supposed to go and take it violently that is why when the devil has taken hold of your children you don't just sit there and are the devil to my children to go and take them back and say Satan give me back my children and say Satan give me back my you taking what is mine for so long but enough is enough I want a Believer to say enough is enough taken so much but today I'm claiming back everything that you have taken from me you have stolen my Prosperity you have stolen my peace you have stolen my sleep I'm claiming them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as John was told go and take the book go and take the book when he went there he said to the angel give me the book he wanted the book to be the angel knew better the angel no no no I'm not supposed to give you the book you are supposed to take it back hallelujah praise God that's why tonight we are stepping into the of the enemy and back every Redemptive bless that God is given us because it's our right to exercise Authority because it is our right take after John went he took the book and after he taken the he ate of the book and he was supposed to prophesy to Generations Kindred Tong and people and Kings my brother I tell you if you have eaten of this book you will prophesy again before Kings you will prophesy again before bosses you prophesy again to presidents and monarchs because after you eat of the book it has got some After Effects the side effects of this book is to make you prophesy the reason why you not prophesying is you haven't taken the that's why haven't you taken the book yet it has been given to you yet it is an open book hallelujah praise God hallelujah hallelujah praise God hallelujah are we together are we together oh if I lost you somewhere oh praise God I hadn't given you I had not given you the title of this message but don't worry in a little while it shall be made know hallel praise God I am just laying a background that you get to know who you really are that you must know what is rightfully yours that you must know that there are no devils in hell that can stand before you why because you are standing in the volume of the book hallelujah hallelujah praise God now we were told in the same Book of Revelation that there were four beasts when the seals were being opened there were four four Riders there was a black hor white hor Rider and the prophet tells us in the first seal that the first host Rider presented deception it was the spirit of the Antichrist that it come to deceive Hallelujah but when we read in the book of Isaiah the book of Isaiah hallelujah praise God CH 59 from verse it will tell you that when the enemy shall come in like a flag the spirit of the Lord shall raise a stand now in the first SE the devil came with the standard of a white horse rer but hallelujah praise God there was an anointing that was upon the face of the Earth as we have read in the Book of Revelation 4 from verse 7 that there was a beast a living creature a lion Hallelujah and in those seven Church ages and in the Seven Seals the prophet explains to us and tells us what that anointing meant the anointing of the word because it is only the word that can expose the devil that is why the devil is afraid of the word because he knows that that word is going to expose him he knows that his destination has been made known in that very that is why it tries as hard as possible to fight the word that is why all the mystery of God been L Through the Ages why that because the devil did not want to be exposed but I tell you tonight the more you eat of this book The more you put yourself together with this book that whatever devil in your life is bothering you going to be exposed I don't care if it's the spirit of where you come from okay if it's the spirit of your uncles who nothing and that's the reason maybe you cannot get a job because your uncle with devil is about to the devil is in trouble the devil is in trouble I say the devil is in trouble he's about to be exposed glory to God hallelujah hallelujah when the enemy shall come in like a flag the spirit of the Lord shall against him now we are told in the following three Church ages there was a dominating Spirit which was the red hor riter now the red rer the red rer the prophet explains that he represented death so many saints were going to be but Jesus Christ said in the Book of John I will not leave you I forsake you but I will be with you even in you until the end of the world now Christ the same was in the beginning that we see in the book of Isaiah being prophesied of the same one we see as a mighty angel coming down with an open book was in the church age and there was an anointing God raised the standard the devil came as the standard of as as the storm of a red horse rider but God rais the standard and the prophet tells us that God does not take a ruler and come with a ruler and come with a ruler and put it here and say I'm now raising a standard take and put it [Music] there God raises men standard that's why when K stood to raise a man standed against Hallelujah that is why when the was of Jer student to raise a standard to raise a Joshua to be a standard in this last day when the devil is roing like a coming to you like a flood in a stor the Lord is raising a Guess Who the standard is you are that standard tonight brother you are the stand that's why the Bible say in the book of Isaiah iise and Shine for your light has come it's time for you to arise you have been sleeping for too long you have been sleeping for too long it's time that you wake up it's time that you rise Arise My Brother arise from where you arise and shine Arise My sister arise from where you sit arise and shine for your light has come glory to God hallelujah hallelujah in the third in the third section we are told there was a black hor Rider who came what did that black represent he represented feine spiritual fine in those Church ages there was no preaching of the true words and there was the preaching of Father Son and the Holy Ghost there was preaching of the there was the the nikan spirit that had become now the Deeds that had now become prevalent that was now about to sit on the throne and the the black H Rider he came the prophet explains and says I want you to see this it is not a different writer it's the same writer that is writing on a different represents a power that's why he told us that in the book there of hos it was not different creatures it was the same creature that was showing itself in four different forms the can thec but it was the same creature in the Book of Revelations there it was the same writer the Antichrist that was writing another but praise God in that day God raised man standard heed like Lu like the intellect that could could write the ordinances against the Roman Catholic church and preach just shall live by fa what was that that was the anointing anointing of their day Hallelujah that was the anointing of their day God raised like that prise God in this last age in this last age there is another anointing that is being Reis there another anointing that is priv to face and challenge the most powerful enemy was the four the fourth seal it tells us of an enemy that was a p Rider the prophet explains it says a p Rider is a mixture of all this col now if you know the prophet one time when he was casting out Devils he says there was one demon that was calling to the other demon for reinforcement the nature of the devil when the devil sees that he being beaten on he go caes other demons and say come and help me come and help me that is why you see your enemy he does not come to you one like one this they will come as many when the enemy wants to come after you your father will rise against you at the same time your wife is rising against you at the same time at your job your boss is rising against you that's the plan of the devil that's what he does when he sees he's being defeated he goes and calls for another another power to come and support him but praise God the Bible says no weapon against shall God does not stop the devil from creating from forming weapons time and say devil go go to make powerful weapon that you think can defeat my people likes to show off God wants to show off with you that is why he let wites come and threaten you that is why he lets your boss come and give you a notice to fire you God allows that to happen why because he wants to prove to the devil that no matter what you do you cannot do anything hallelujah hallelujah no weapon formed against you shall prosper noer against the bride Prosper hallelujah hallelujah because today
