dwell in US amen when God is not when God is outside US [Music] God is weak [Music] the only way God can display his power [Music] is when God gets a body to dwell in blessed with the name of the Lord

of God things happen miracles happen celebration take place take place in the presence of God Amen one day Elizabeth and John was dead in the womb when the presence of God came down something took

[Applause] [Applause] [Music] into somewhere else presence okay [Music] of Prayer prayer is just pureed amen you pray today you pray the next two days each time you pray something is happening One Wish again imagine that is what I know with prayers we have been praying for years and years sometimes you go in the bush sometimes you go in the mountains you need to have some quiet time with the Lord because you're creating animal atmosphere between you and God blessed be the name of the Lord when I see when a Christian enter in the presence of God that's when you will know who you are how good and how bad you are [Music] [Applause] when God comes down he will show us our our Falls [Applause] [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina praise the Lord we need that presence we need that Grace in our lives we should not allow that conviction to die a Christian you must have a conviction even Sinners they have convictions blessed with the name of the Lord they all know we can keep moving in this channel amen the presence of God remember God is building a house and this house must be perfected it must be accomplished and every single day amen add a new Mortal bricks is growing house is moving onwards until we reach Perfection [Applause] you don't just sit and say God thou knows you you predestined my end and you know ABCD died [Music] [Applause] blessed with the name of the Lord [Applause] Exodus chapter 3 [Applause] [Applause] he's a king foreign [Music] and they come not Jet and they give us a good way bless the Lord there's some preachers who preach until you become uncomfortable today blessed with the name of the Lord sometimes we bring teachers blessed with the name of the Lord but all is for the Perfection of the Bride blessed the prophet say that I want his presence may God look down now and fill each one of your heart full of his presence if you are only wearing Church government you better get rid of the things amen Amina you can't go behind the holness of holy trust someone again the government that the high priests were in there had to be made out of holy hand a champion again I selected Goods ordained of God it has to be a god-selected rope do you know that God selected Rome he's the holy ghosts he destroyed it is perfect it is himself in the presence of God [Music] the thing of it is that people my brother sister and friends is to be conscious of your littleness is [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord God's presence is so sensitive that's why even we Christians we have to be very careful amen we ought to be vigilant for those who've ever been to shrines they will tell you when the judges are presence you are not even allowed to scratch that itching point of views they will beat you up foreign [Applause] [Music] are you conscious of God's presence [Music] do you know that same God oh magnitude the world is to strike people dead is the same God we are serving today amen do you know that throughout has never changed blessed with the name of the Lord the Bible says he receives Glory alone foreign why do you think people get that courageous even to be chatting when they're in charge it is because they are not conscious of the presence of God because they are not in God's presence in the name of the Lord the Bible tells us to seek the presence of God he never went somewhere else but he knew there is something about being in his presence and when he came in his presence he started praying yeah for the grace of God Amen and when the presence of God came down he was the prophet he had in a big major prophet and communicated by God Amen where the presence of God came down yeah now your Prophet has come captain today they are going to see me not with Isaiah is that vision is still real even today because the Bible tells us [Music] when they're hanging themselves not dreaming you are late Grand grandfathers diabubi but this is spiritual dreams and this is what's supposed to be happening in the church because we know what we believe no this is our problems blessed be the name of the Lord he said the young man will dream they will see Vision not television City it is also Vision negative vision it tells the vision but seeing spiritual vision my brothers my sisters [Music] blessed with the name of the Lord when Isaiah went to the temple again when he was in the presence of God and God will started revealing to Isaiah the way he was looking like but he was even dwelling amongst the people with Anakin lips in the king's palace [Music] men and women blessed with the name of the Lord foreign [Music] [Applause] that is what happened to that on the day of Pentacles what happened there when the day of Pentecost was fully counted there came a sound of a mind now watch Global tongues what was that charity that was the presence of God and when the brothers came and and possessed them they preached the gospel in another fashion and they hear us were pricked in their hearts the presence of God presence of God Amen that is what we need when the prince of God is in on me you will not struggle with people to clap their hands you will not fight with them to live right the presence of God will do the meaningful praying God is sorrow in the house of men and women yes [Music] [Applause] you cannot receive the Holy Spirit when you are busy judging your friends about nonsense you every time when you're on phone you're watching muhanji and uh and these are men and women who are abused they are possessed with demon of obesity foreign oh brother sister we will see that the Rapture is so close the reason asked why you will hardly hear the Pentecostal preaching about the coming of the Lord because the presence of God departed from them it is [Applause] to perform on their platforms to entertain their people demons in the world people entertain demons in their belief so-called Believers amen they are no longer preaching about the second coming of Christ they are preaching about worlds those things they are good but if you are not careful will end up becoming religious people also blessed with the name of the Lord if we don't listen to the world if we don't pray brother sister we are not in me without what keeps you it's only the presence of God there is an answer we don't pray for others in the seat for your brother your sister I will not ask you to raise your hands but if you know that you are not doing so please pray for me remember in your presence and then you go home you see when someone sent texts to me kindly remember me what I do not become the victims at that very moment I first pray for that person yeah brother we are going to pray you together and then they say how many prayed for me blessed of God you cannot plan you forget science blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says that the government that the high priest were in the hand okay we have read that quote we find that John humbered himself the praise of God and the theme of it is my brother my sister and Friends be conscious of your littleness don't be conscious of how big you are how little you are in our midst now that brings Holiness not my holiness foreign [Applause] that was opportunity foreign he is how bad the devil can anoint somebody and that's why the Bible says foreign that never know it's a fool satania have come after and comes tinkling shoes and they said today chameleon is going to sample us blessed be the name of the Lord amen the praise of God brings Holiness it brings seriousness [Music] it brings discernments when that presence comes down we see things differently foreign [Music] there is too much pressure in the world [Music] it's too too much a lot is happening and if the church is not careful we're taking the result we may be drifted from the truth twins blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina in a message going beyond.com the prophet says and in his campaign it was almost every day occasion that Abram met God to talk to him not only that when they went down in the great uh in the in the garage we find out earlier that God was in the camp with our marriage and today they live in their own come they haven't got nothing to do with God Has Come On which club do you live in today brother sister let us leave in the cup of God's presence stop running a man running from the presence don't get out of his presence okay just move up into his presence amen listen we have got to learn the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened how the church need to learn his presence you know and get sweet in the press in the spirit so that it can bathe foreign amen you are part of it praise be to God what do we need his presence you are because the bride the brightest part of the Bride is a part of the grooming so we find out that it's the same thing she will do just exactly what was predicted of her to do in this day um not by no means but she will be on fire oh God is the part of the group it cannot be something different it is foreign [Music] [Applause] if you are the part of the prize there is no negotiations [Applause] [Applause] if you foreign [Applause] brother matter is scaring us no but you must reach somewhere or you know and make a decision great and clear decisions do you think you will hear this word forever and ever let that one of these days praise be to God this is Life Soul Saving business where the government is trading his soldiers government will written the karmaji they don't play with them my father told me when you go where the training commanders they use live bullets because the police I think whom they use rubber bullets those are the people who go for covert operations [Applause] and when make sure they don't arrest you if you'll be arrested we don't know who are fighting with the demons and you think we are going to overcome the devil okay now I'm gonna sit down with your rubber bullets young men young women I think you're going to overcome the table by missing Church [Applause] blessed in the name of the Lord they must know what they stand before the devil is not your friends amen Amina don't be deceived the devil is just looking for the way of finishing you at once you go do your dirty things yeah and you'll be on front page the one without dust there is a young man I want to see brother true isn't this brother cute probably the result maybe they are twins it is impossible maybe his twin brother foreign [Music] [Music] full of problems don't think that when you are saved I'm not trying to get this through US hindrance in this life it is the presence of God praise be to God amen Amina let us Shake ourselves from the dust of flowers the Bible says they shall rise and shine why are we not shining when our light has gone let us arise let us live the life word of the Gospel praise be to God foreign you know sometime when you sit in church there are Corners which personally I cannot see it is you better sit in the main corners but when he's sitting to a cold brother even that little lightly praise be to God amen I mean when the Holy Spirit comes it has not only quickened our spirit weaken each and everything about it you know having the Holy Spirit it's just the same as knowing whether when you die right now where you are going oh man when we're still Catholic they told us that when you die you are going to find two roads we didn't ask whether in the sky or down the one which is dirty with thorns and Scarlets Express Highway Express and we wish to close what to console ourselves I will just take this one full of tons this is the road you can know if you die now where you are going oh you know yourself and where you are sitting remind me but if you have been speaking the word of God you are very sure that when you die in a way we are quick and up in the presence of God of it if you are a part of the pride you are because the pride is part of the grooming blessed with the name of the Lord you see the Holy Spirit has been spoken about until we think it's now normal not until you receive the holy ghosts foreign [Music] if we are going to get anywhere tonight hours if not we are going to be overwhelmed by troubles [Music] [Applause] you may be a homosexual in a church you may be selling yourself in the middle of the church you may be selling yourself while you're in the middle of the church what makes us different it is the Holy Spirit and that is the new birth forgive me I've been doing so and so so what is going to prevent us as I said we are not immune government Infinity we are making one big fireman we should never ever lose the presence of God in our lives [Music] praise be to God she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on the spirit of God um and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshing his presence God will take care of the rest on conditions amen just live for God live and pray every day God Will Take Care of the rest day I just when the church get to that place where in the presence of God listen when the church get to that place means so much to us to get in his presence each other life is giving resource life-giving resources where that cross means so much to us
