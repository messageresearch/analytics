the face of Jesus Christ and then he says but we have this treasure in Athen vessels by the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair two times persecuted but not for seconds passed down but not destroyed and here Apostle Paul writes again the same one who had written the first words to the Corinthians who he writes again to the Philippians and here he says I thank God I thank my God upon every remembrance of you always in prayer of mind for you or a knuckles for your fellowship the gospel from the first day until now being confident now here is where Paul's confidence was being confident of this very thing which has begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ you see the greatest fear that the human race has is failure you know man usually fears failure some of you who are at school and are pursuing certain degrees or diplomas or certificates you know the devil the best thing he can bring to you is to bring you fear that you will fail at it and you see the devil will tell you you know you might not pass and the devil might tell you well you know you will not get the full amount of your tuition and maybe in the middle somewhere you may not make it [Music] and you know if you are having a job you know the devil may bring you fear that you see his job of yours foreign but if you don't make Google because this gospel you keep hearing everything we keep hearing that kind of gospel every day and you know the devil likes preaching the gospel of what if so yeah you know that's what it used to preach to Jesus you tell him if you are the son of and you know one thing that is not about the devil is that he does not know he wasn't too sure about who Jesus was killing but what if you failure what if that happens and I've come here today to preach to the true ghosts I've come here this evening to just simply tell you that Jesus Christ is the author and the finisher amen he's the author of my life he's the finisher of my life it has all foreign [Music] [Music] do you really see him as somebody who is worried about his treasure he's not worried if he was worried he would have put some metallic something and then he would put his treasure in there lock it up with steel now and then he would you know put it somewhere where you cannot reach but you see do not do that because he is confidence it's not in the in the vessel his confidence confidence he's in the light pretty much as we saw is the treasure the light is the world the light is gone and that is actually Jesus Christ and he is the author and the finisher I am confident of this very thing that he which has begun a good work in you were performing everybody say he will perform it he will perform it sometimes things may happen that may try to show as if what God has started May [Music] fails but there is nothing that God starts will ever failure I I am molded out of his hands Hallelujah there is nothing nothing I am undestructible in the city Society I am permanent if the devil doesn't like me if it doesn't like me to be around I would like to tell him tonight he might as well begin to get used to me because I'm not going away anytime soon I am here to leave to fulfill the purpose of God Hallelujah Amina you know if you have your enemy he always is praying when will he or she go es it is the time the time to tell the devil that he should get used to us because we are still here we must be fulfilled God is the purpose for our life hallelujah amen when will she die when will he go when will he get sick at the beginning foreign [Music] no [Music] foreign foreign look at your age let me tell you I've come to speak to you today we encourage you to tell you to tell the devil I'm not the one who is he initiated it yeah yeah he will finish it hallelujah amen mine is to yield to him the rest is none of my business that one will make the devil crazy where were you foreign [Music] okay how many I've ever played with the clay all right now you know that there is one thing that knows how to yield where are you and that is not like a brick a boomer doesn't have too far it's not even like soil from other soils where where you put it is where it goes foreign [Music] the Bible says in Hebrews 12 2 looking unto Jesus the author at the finishes [Music] [Music] I want you to despise your trouble despite your weakness despise your sin you make sure despite your your troubles and you go through every day and look unto Jesus hallelujah amen amen hallelujah Christian is the one who brought you into that marriage relationship you didn't take yourself and you burn yourself he is the author of your family aspect of our life nobody can say no perimeters when Jesus says yes hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the Lord and he says he despised the and he sits down at the right hand of the Throne of God I want you to see something here today of our life foreign [Music] on the right hand the Bible that is and this is um symbolic something when he says in the in the Ephesians with the Seven Stars in his right hand now this is talking about uh Revelation chapter one two and three years the right hand or arm signifies the power and authority of God hallelujah tell your neighbor power and authorities those two things are similar but they're different and internet power a man and then authority authority it's like what an officer would have she didn't go Miss silicone a traffic officer stands she may be a woman has but you see as long as she she's a traffic officer she had the authority [Music] on the road and lift up our house and it doesn't matter who you are as long as you are in front of her so you will have to stop that's Authority Hallelujah I mean power our entire mind is to make things happen amen and the right hand of God or the Throne of God Jesus being on the right hand of the Throne of God yes it means he's on the right hand it means he has the power and he has the authority [Music] for Jesus to be on the right hand of the Throne of God yes it means he is the above it means he has there is no one Beyond him [Music] there is no more power no more Authority it is God who is the power and who is the authority yeah they for the Gods Not the land in possession by their own sword yeah neither did neither did their own arms save them yeah and you remember a lot of something we read in Corinthians which said we are okay says that to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and here he says [Music] because thou has had a favor unto them so now the truth of Israel he did not go into the Promised Land by their own swords they didn't get out of Egypt because of how they how well they knew how to fight they didn't receive a breakthrough because of how strong their hand was listen to me the children of Israel remember he says the light of his continent nature [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] so now about the treasure in athenics and here we are seeing that Jesus Christi and the finisher of our faith is that a man and then we see here that we are not going to overcome by our own power by our authorities foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] are you following me so this signifies that the very power and authority of God Amen happy behind the messenger to every age did you get that so where is the power and authority okay hallelujah amen so those of you who believe the message of the hour this is the power and authority of God then okay man you know when we say the word of God the revelation of the world when we say the word of God because theater there is a revelation and in our days that shines and we can be able to see clearly there is nothing in the Bible such as women preachers those who do not know that they are in darkness but those who knows they are those who have had the message of the messenger so they are not working in darkness they are working in their life and we are able to know what the original sin was that is and that was the beginning of Sorrow and we were able to know the the the horse riders [Music] confusion among the children of God but how the spirit of God has been raising in every age you see this light has shines and and and and it says these Stars they go for it's beginning in the in the fire and Power in the moment of the Holy Ghost s they are stars because they reflect light is it's a question people would um and the light of the stars come from the Sun it is seven Messengers from the days of Paul okay he was the first up to William Branham in Our Generation all these Messengers they didn't have their own life that's why they did not start their own churches or denominations reflected light from Jesus Christ that made me walk in the light of their spots it is night for that is when the stars come out or whatever it is the night of the Blackness of sin we're able to awake today for all even the whole world the Bible says the whole world all have sinned and are constantly falling short of the glory again but here is the Blessed hope Brothers [Music] I don't look at my insufficiency hallelujah amen praise the name of the Lord he said I'll give you some of the promises so I don't plan on being attacked I have no plans I'm sorry oh the plant I have is to be head head head hey hallelujah amen for he speaks in his promises that we will have a body change I don't have plans to die [Music] why because they said it he wants us to be in good healthy and he wants us to process and therefore I don't I don't plan on on being a beggar because in the city you know what he is one of my favorite scriptures let me pray unto the Lord and he said Lord come on he said make do not make me very rich that I may you know be proud but don't make me poor but guess what tonight he was one of the richest man on earth when you hear his prayer you might think that his prayer made him a mediocre always understand made him a great man on Earth [Music] some of you when you go to work you have a mind of being a slave you you have a mind of being and a subduction but let me tell you the children of God you should have a mind of being having Dominion today hallelujah amen we should have a mind what David are like what Solomon are like what all these great men and women I'll give you one more I believe his name was uh what's up to go and and be give to the land again I don't take foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] he wants to begin with him truly [Music] you stand on our ground and say no I don't believe that this is what I'm saying I don't believe this is a treasure foreign and they went and paid their taxes because they told them the reason which first is there yeah and he told them that's right so who made that money but in the moment himself was fast with paying his taxes is that he did not say again he went in the Bank of Heaven yeah and he picked out of the mouth of the fish did you hear that the mouth of the fish he told me to go and fish what do you know what to do that foreign [Music] don't know how to do business it is I mean when we put this principles in our life you see the areas of our finances will also change see we need to change our mindset to choose to change the world with few things stop accepting three things and also stop begging is he is the author yes foreign foreign foreign hey [Music] hey right now okay ask for a million dollars you think God cannot do it again [Music] he created money out of the mouth of the fish yeah foreign [Music] is [Music] hallelujah amen God God is blessing God wants to do for you God wants to do something for you God wants to feed your ass will you believers if you as a child of God and that kid is the queen woman with someone that you love foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] blah you must have that fight Hallelujah wherever you you meet at work when you're crazy when you don't have a lot of responsibilities because here and now listen to me you can be used by God any time in your life [Music] Paul was able to say but I brought my wrists he
