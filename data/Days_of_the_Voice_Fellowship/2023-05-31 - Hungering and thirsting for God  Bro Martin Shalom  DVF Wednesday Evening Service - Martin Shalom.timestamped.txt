[27:54] foreign
[28:41] I Define when
[28:42] they are just lightings
[29:02] [Music]

[30:09] after the things of the world
[30:15] [Applause]
[31:09] praise be to God
[31:13] you shall be filled
[31:15] when there is a hunger and thirst in
[31:18] your soul
[31:20] when you're hungry and fasting after God
[31:23] when there is that deep calling unto the
[31:26] day
[31:30] somewhere
[31:32] you always respond towards
[31:37] amen and when you are not fasting
[31:42] and when you are not hungry
[31:45] brother sister
[31:47] there is something wrong somewhere
[31:54] ah
[31:58] I assume you are there
[32:01] you don't get fast
[32:03] you don't get hungry
[32:06] will you just sit and relax
[32:09] and it starts bursting around
[32:13] us like I'm becoming superhuman to watch
[32:18] they no longer feel hungry
[32:21] it is
[32:27] okay probably I'm fine let me tell you
[32:30] if you are on your right mind
[32:33] when you're in right you are right
[32:36] you will go and seek for medical
[32:38] attention
[32:42] amen mean you will call Dr Peter and
[32:45] tell him
[32:46] brother I think there is something wrong
[32:50] I no longer gets thrust no hunger
[32:55] amen
[32:57] and then he will he will advise you
[33:01] blessed with the name of the Lord
[33:06] and that will be one of the clear signs
[33:08] that something is wrong with you
[33:15] and you have no time you don't eat food
[33:19] and you're not hungry
[33:28] something is not right in your life
[33:33] foreign
[34:33] water for you to be alive amen
[34:39] I'm talking about hungering and fasting
[34:42] for God
[34:46] blessed with the name of the Lord
[34:50] how many of us do online fast for God
[34:55] and if we use that discretion that anger
[34:58] is another definition
[35:27] you really feel like you should even
[35:30] just get a drop of water blessed with
[35:32] the name of the Lord because the border
[35:35] is demanding
[35:36] [Music]
[35:38] but remember
[35:43] there is another man inside
[35:48] amen
[35:49] and David says as the hard palate for
[35:54] water broke away
[35:58] to my soul fast after God
[36:04] our soul is meant with us
[36:10] and every Christian must be fast after
[36:13] God
[36:21] when your soul is thirsting after God
[36:24] [Music]
[36:27] blessed be the name of the Lord
[36:31] just like the way it is physically
[36:33] that you can't spend a day without
[36:36] taking water
[36:39] but sometimes Christians spend days
[36:43] without prayer whatever
[36:48] they don't read the word
[36:51] they don't pray they don't first some
[36:56] even claimed that the prophet first lady
[36:58] for them
[37:00] I remember
[37:03] but let me hope that that group is not
[37:05] here
[37:08] you will have to fast for yourself
[37:12] nobody will fast for you
[37:18] some claim that the groom is here
[37:22] there's no need for fasting
[37:24] [Music]
[37:36] we are living in the ends of the end
[37:39] times
[37:42] we all to be more serious than even the
[37:45] first Runners
[37:49] more serious than those who started this
[37:52] race
[37:55] because we are seeing the Finishing Line
[37:58] [Music]
[38:24] blessed in the name of the Lord now we
[38:26] are the people who have reached who are
[38:28] reaching the finishing life
[38:31] and Church of God
[38:35] either you are fasting after God all you
[38:39] are fasting after the devil
[38:41] [Music]
[38:44] you will never be neutral
[38:48] and if you don't if you're not fasting
[38:51] after God
[38:53] that is a clear sign that you are
[38:56] fasting after the devil
[39:00] the things of the world
[39:03] if you don't have time to pray
[39:07] that is
[39:10] [Music]
[39:15] hey man Nina blessed in the name of the
[39:18] Lord
[39:32] listen to this quote
[39:34] and any man that is born of the spirit
[39:37] of God
[39:38] um
[39:45] the world
[39:48] and they are separated in different life
[39:53] because they can't digest it
[40:13] are the things of God
[40:20] blessed with the name of the Lord
[40:23] you let us look to be something simple
[40:28] but fast is the drive is that driving
[40:31] force
[40:35] a Christian who does not have fast for
[40:38] God um
[40:43] you cannot get anywhere
[40:47] dust is that driving force
[40:50] you cannot receive the Holy Ghost
[40:53] without faster
[40:56] you cannot receive God in your soul
[41:01] unless she was bursting after God
[41:05] and you cannot have fast for God
[41:08] unless you are reading the word
[41:11] unless you're listening to the world
[41:14] unless you're praying and fasting
[41:17] that is the only way
[41:20] blessed with the name of the Lord
[41:24] amen Amina
[41:28] if you are if you have come hungering
[41:30] and thirsting for God
[41:35] the angels of God will direct you to
[41:38] that spot to find it
[41:47] amen Amina
[41:49] but if you don't if you're not hungry
[41:53] they will not die they will direct you
[41:55] nowhere
[41:57] you must have that thirstyness
[42:11] are you sure
[42:14] but where your heart is
[42:17] where your riches
[42:20] that is where your heart will be
[42:23] if your wishes is with God your heart
[42:27] will be where where God

[44:07] but find them in church
[44:18] we must hang to take it
[44:21] we must
[44:24] this is a must
[44:26] because if you don't have anger for God
[44:29] forget about Rapture amen
[44:35] this is the driving force
[44:39] that's how he sold fast after God
[44:43] made me away
[44:45] and he's asking God When shall I appear
[44:49] before
[44:56] every time you will ask God awareness

[1:03:39] Spirit
[1:03:41] don't explain anything
[1:03:45] this is the word there is something
[1:03:48] foreign
