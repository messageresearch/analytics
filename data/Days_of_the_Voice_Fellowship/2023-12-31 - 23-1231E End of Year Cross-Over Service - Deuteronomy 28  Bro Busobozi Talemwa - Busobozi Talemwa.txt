where there won't be time where there will not be time and there will not be numbering there will be no growing old because we would have would have arrived at a place where we desire to be where your word has promised us that we shall be and now father Lord before we reach there we are here on this other side of time and we keep growing older and older Seasons come and Seasons go times and seasons pass but Lord one thing that is permanent is your word that is what keeps us that's what has made us who we are and that's why we would want to be in your presence as we start another season yet in this counting of time we just want to dwell in your house forever Lord sometimes when your Holy Spirit comes down and you uh anointing an atmosphere of worship we don't even feel like leaving it but because of these seasons of times and Counting we just need to leave and continue on with errands we have to run here and there but Lord I understand this is where we belong this is where our hearts belong this is where our souls belong and we are so happy this this evening to be in your presence we are so happy father that this year would find us this coming year would find us in your presence hearing your word praying singing worshiping the King of Kings and the Lord of lords we are so grateful this this this morning father now we are going to share a little portion out of your holy word to just prepare us for this cross Overlord into another year I pray that you will inspire this uh these verses that we're going to read that someone here will have a reserve to serve you better we commit it into your hands in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] amen praise the Lord hallelujah amen I'm so happy to see all of you here tonight uh it's a blessing turn to your neighbor tell them God bless you so you can know and see who is close close close to you all right just tell them welcome in the house of the Lord amen do we need interpretation brother SE today you going to hear English is that okay God bless you amen so this evening I just want to is it evening or morning it is still evening uh how many enjoyed the dinner amen so uh God bless those who cooked and uh those who hosted us we are so grateful amen uh please turn to your Bibles in the book of Deuteronomy chapter 28 so uh today I'm going to do something that I've never done before I don't have a subject I don't have a title I don't have notes I have nothing I have the Bible with me and uh God inspired me to read this scripture for you and I trust that it will bless someone here today as we are crossing over into this New Year praise God so we are just maybe the brother on the streaming if you want a title just set theonomy 28 Deuteronomy 28 that's what we are dealing with I'll just read a few portions a little portion and then you will just be seated so we can talk about the rest while you are seated and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hecken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth amen do we believe that amen you may be seated and we ask God's blessings upon the word this uh this evening so as you noticed uh we have a few moments I'm sorry there are people who uh we supposed to be singing and we have also testimonies but we we are 1 hour late so uh if you must give that before we go if we want testimonies only that are burning testimonies of the things that God has done for you this this old year of 2023 which we are leaving so don't go back with those testimonies things maybe a service which was preached and helped you or something that God did for you through prayer or you know whatever you have that the Lord did for you we want to have those testimonies and so don't go with them together after the preaching we are going to go into prayer uh uh let the the New Year find us in prayer how many have their needs that they have written on their papers okay now a few have written uh needs if you you've not written your needs uh then the Bible says that write the vision it may T but it will surely come to pass so write it down writing it down is is a show and uh a show of Faith so write it down uh when we go in prayer you just commit it before God and keep it somewhere you will realize that at the end of the year uh you can bring it out and you realize that God has answered most of your prayers if not all so now this evening I just want to share um I have a burden on sharing this chapter with you I was reading it for some brethren and I noticed it is a a blessing it is a a very huge chapter but we shall cover as much as we can before we go to prayer this evening now I noticed in the morning I I shared with you on uh on crossing over crossing over into the next phase now I believe that we are at a time when we are crossing over not only the crossover of a year but we are crossing over into another phase you know we are entering into a place where others have never entered before 2024 David never saw 2024 no one has ever seen I mean all those who lived before us think about it those of you who are born in the 80s and the 70s and the 60s imagine did you ever think that you will live to 2024 2024 that's many years a many years ahead you thought but here we are 2024 is here and very soon if the L tell is we are going to be counting 2040 2050 2060 I don't believe we shall get there before the Lord Jesus Christ comes back again but if we get there here is what I want to show you that the Lord has given to me to give to you in this new year how many remember remember what we shared on last year December 31st sister Winnie huh yeah I think that was within the the year or close to the end of year but yes brother you have the subject it's the same thing ah Brethren I think we are forgotten I was just looking here I saw something like um something different I don't know why you are saying that but uh I think it was something different that's why we talked about Arnold Von winked and we were talking about uh we are talking about uh let me find it here just a moment yes yes do the best you can ah God bless you my brother do the best you can that's what we talked about but this year we are not talking about doing the best you can but let me ask how many have done the best they could this past year I believe we have done the best we could to serve God if whenever you came to the service here you have done the best you could whenever you prayed you've done the best you could but now this year we're talking about getting into the next phase now not doing the best you can but getting into the next phase getting into the next phase praise the name of the Lord now the next phase is going to be nothing but a blessing of God all right so the ones who came in the the morning and did not come here in this service they are going to miss so here we are talking about um the next phase which is the blessing of of God the blessing in the land remember these people the Jews the when they were crossing over when they crossed over from from um Egypt and they were crossing over uh the Red Sea going to the promised land H their purpose their purpose was the promised land and they were purpose to cross over into the promised land but there are conditions of blessing in the promised land now today I want to just share with you Deuteronomy 28 talking about the blessings of the promised land so get your Bible get your Bible and brother put those scriptures we are going to read verse by verse I'm just laying it out to you as it is in the Bible and I trust that we will take it serious and it will be a blessing to each of us uh this this evening amen and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hecken diligently unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day 31st December 2023 to observe and to do all his Commandments which I command thee this day that the Lord thy God will set the the on high above all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee he is saying all the the blessings which is going to tell you all these blessings shall come on thee not only that but they will overtake thee they will come on you and they will overtake you and then he says if Thou shalt hecken unto the voice of the Lord thy God and now he begins the blessings how many to hear the blessings amen now whatever blessing you say Amen to it will be a portion number one he says blessed shalt thou be in the city and blessed shalt thou be in the field Hallelujah blessed shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy ground and the fruit of thy cattle increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy sheep he continues on blessed shall be thy basket and thy store now these blessings are so many and I trust that our amen will grow stronger and stronger and stronger because the more the blessing is coming the more we should grow stronger and better praise the name of the Lord number six blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in and blessed shalt thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall cause thy enemies that rise up against thee to be smen before thy face they shall come out against thee one way and flee before the seven ways the Lord shall command the blessing upon thee in thy stor houses and in all that thou set thy hand oh my God and all set thy hand unto whatever you set yourto I'm telling you this is another phase whatever you were doing if it was not going well now he's saying whatever you will set your hand unto and he shall bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee now if you if you are crossing over into the next pH this is the blessings which are a waiting for you there Hallelujah and then he says the Lord shall establish thee and all people unto himself as he has sworn unto thee if thou shal keep the Commandments of the Lord thy God and walk in his ways and all the people of the Earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the Lord and they shall be afraid of theeen Hallelujah right there do we believe the blessings and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruit of thy body and in the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy ground in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to give Thee the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt land unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow Hallelujah someone joined me to say 2024 no more borrowing put it on your mouth no more borrowing no more borrowing 224 no more borrowing Hallelujah they will say bunch of Pentecostal yes we have Pentecostal by experience Hallelujah H these blessings I'm telling you they're touching me so much amen and the Lord shall make Thee the head and not the tail and thou sh be above [Laughter] only Hallelujah and thou shall be above only brother Peter can I hear a big amen there hallelujah oh my God and and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath if if that thou hecken unto the Commandments of the Lord thy God which I command thee this day to observe and to do them and thou shalt not go aside from any of The Words which I command the this day to the right hand or to the left to go after other gods to serve them and then it continues on here now but it shall come to pass verse 15 I pray from verse 15 it will not be your portion but nonetheless let me read a few when I I read deom 28 the curses are more than the blessings are you hearing me that's why you see when people don't follow Jesus Christ with all their heart they are they have a lot of problems and they seem that they are worse than the people who are following Jesus Christ that's why you should really serve God with all your heart I want Deuteronomy 28 from verse 1 to verse4 to be my portion in Jesus name let it be your portion in Jesus name for year 2024 but just for others who are not expecting to follow Jesus Christ with all their heart you hear from verse 15 and because the cures are so many I will not finish all of them they're just so many verse 15 but it shall come to pass if thou Willl not hecken unto the voice of the Lord thy God to observe to do all his Commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day that all these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee uhhuh now the one on who are wanting these curses they can say Amen verse 16 Cur shall thou be in the city and cast shall thou be in the field cast shall be thy basket and thy store cast shall be the fruit of thy body and the fruit of thy land the increase of thy kind and the flocks of thy of thy sheep and I pray instead of saying amen you would say God forbid cast shall thou be when thou comest in and cast sh thou be when thou goest out the Lord shall send upon thee cursing vexation and rebuke in all that thou set thy hand unto for to do until thou be destroyed and until thou perish quickly because of the wickedness of thy doings whereby thou Hast forsaken me God forbid God forbid that the Lord shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee until have until he have consumed thee from off the land with thou goest to possess it the Lord shall smite thee with a cons a a consumtion and with a fever and with a un inflammation and with un extreme burning and with a sword and with a blasting and with a mild you and they shall pursue thee until thou perish God forbid and a heaven that is over thy head shall be brass and the earth that is under thee shall be Iron the Lord shall make oh my God you better say God forbid orless this will happen to you the Lord shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust from Heaven shall it come down upon thee until thou be destroyed the Lord shall cause thee to be smen before thine enemies thou shall go out one way against them and flee seven ways before them and shall be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth and I cus shall be meat unto all folds of the air and unto all the beasts of the earth and no man shall free them away the Lord will smite thee with the with the bch of Egypt and with the emeralds and with a scab and with the is whether of thou can not be healed the Lord shall smite thee with Madness that's why they are mad out there because they under a curse if you are not under the blessing of God you are under a curse brother be under the blessing of God because here is the curse he says the Lord shall smite thee with Madness and blindness and astonishment of heart and thou shalt grow at noon day as the blind grth in darkness and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways and thou shall not shall um be only oppressed and spoiled ever ever more and no man shall save thee Thou shalt betro a wife and another man shall lie with her are you hearing Brothers brother say God forbid on this one is very serious imagine engaging a sister and another man take her God forbid Thou shalt build an house and thou shalt not dwell therein Thou shalt plant a vineard and shalt not gather the grapes thereof thy o shall be slain before thy eyes and thou shalt not eat thereof Thine Eyes shall be violently taken away from before thy face and shall not be restored to thee enemies and thou shalt have none to rescue them thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people oh my God and an eyes shall look and fail with longing for them all day long and there shall be no might in thy hand the fruit of thy land and all thy labors shall be a nation shall a nation which thou knowest not eat up and thou shalt be only oppressed and crushed always my God I God forbid that one so that thou Hast shalt be mad for the sight of thy eyes which Thou shalt see the Lord shall smite thee in the knees and in the legs with a s b that cannot be healed from the so of thy foot unto the top of thy head instead I say if you follow the word of God God will bless your feet because you'll be taking the gospel of peace and he'll bless you from the crown of your head to the swords of your feet but the cast still is for those are not following verse 36 the Lord shall bring thee and thy King and and thy King which Thou shalt set over thee unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers have known and there shalt thou serve other gods wood and stone and thou shalt become an astonishment a proverb a byword among all nations with the Lord shall lead thee God forbid that thou shalt carry much seed out into the field and shalt gather but a little in for the Locust shall consume it God forbid Thou shalt plant Vineyards and Dr them but shalt neither drink of the wine nor gather the grapes for the worms shall eat them Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy CA but Thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil for thy oil shall cast his fruit Thou shalt beget sons and daughters but Thou shalt not enjoy them for they shall go into captivity God forbid all thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the Locust consume my God I'm tired of reading curses the curses are continuous God bless you for that God bless you for that friends when you look at Deuteronomy 28 after here I'm requesting you to go and read it take your time and read it uh the Bible says the blessing of God maketh rich and he adds no sorrow meaning he adds no curse on it that's why these people who say that uh you can be in Christ and you are under a curse they are wrong you cannot be under a curse when you are filled with the Holy Spirit and when you following the ways of the word the curse comes only to you when you do not have the blessing of God you know there was a Brothers you know dozing in in the church down in Zimbabwe and and he had removed his shoes in a very comfortable place like that and he had removed his shoes and his shoes were on the side and the pastor was preaching talking about Elisha and um rather talking about Elijah going and Elisha was following on and then he said the Chariot of fire came down and The Chariot of Fire took Elijah and then the man woke up he was hearing the story while he was sleeping so he woke up and stood on his feet he said ah he has gone with my shoes he said so the brother the brother who the brother who was close by he told him brother your shoes are here Elijah did not go with them and the brother was standing looking up he has going with my shoes so even for him to sit down was a problem he never doed in church again you know so don't cross over the and say ah they have left me and they are still here so we are crossing over don't cross over with dozing in the church say amen hallelujah my my my my my you should cross over the Y when you are sober you should go to the next this next phase when you are sober so friends uh for the for a few more minutes maybe five minutes I was telling you that you know when God gives you the blessing that blessing he does not add sorrow on it so it is impossible listen this is a Doctrine it is impossible for someone to be in Christ and still be cast did you know that it is impossible number number two it is impossible for someone to be in Christ and Witchcraft to be upon them are you hearing it is impossible the moment you are in Christ they can be all they want that that witchcraft can not catch you because you are under protection you know the Bible says there is no enchantment upon Israel no witchcraft to Jacob you know it is impossible to bech you it is impossible if you are in Christ or you you confess Christ but you know what was the condition and it shall come to pass if Thou shalt hecken diligently unto the voice of the Lord goder to do all his Commandments which iand this day that the Lord thy God will set thee on high above all all nations of the earth and all these blessings shall come on thee and overtake you meaning the blessings when they come they will even overtake you wherever you go the blessing will have gone there F so it will be following you and and it will be ahead of you and following you praise the name of the Lord but if you don't do that then the Cur will be following how many want the blessing of God in 2024 Hallelujah let me tell you right now as I'm speaking to you there are many people in shrines right now now now now they in shrines getting the anointing of a they in shrines they are cutting them they are putting drugs they are you know you know doing enchantments they are you know blessing them they are you know bringing powder K shells is it called K shells and other things but all those that they are going to get their ACC curses but for you you are here going to get the blessing of God and my prayer for you for 2024 but remember this prayer has a condition so that's where we are different because the Pentecost will tell you take the blessing but you're taking the blessing from nowhere you either trust God or you don't trust him all but if you trust him then the blessing of God must come upon your life and all the blessing we have read today you know from verse one up to verse 14 I want to say let it be your portion let it be your portion in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and that is my crossover message period Hallelujah now I want those ones who have been serious who are following me that have written WR their needs to stand up only the ones who have written their needs

them we are now going to change into prayer where are the musicians you are not going to give your needs to anyone but to the Lord You're just writing it down it may not even be a need it may be a

spirit within me God bless [Music] you praise God Church praise God I thank God so much for last year I thank God so much for my life I I had a problem with my C like four years years ago and I was supposed to be operated I went to the hospital and they told me that I'm going to be operated I deposited money full money for the operation but was during covid the issues of transport and how to travel and I didn't go to hospital for that operation that's how I missed the operation and all the payment was paid what has been disturbing me before going to the hospital for the for the operation okay before going to the hospital the time they told me I'm supposed to be operated I kept going to hospital earlier on but they keep they kept giving me medicine when I take that medicine the Cod issue stops for just very few days and it comes back I go back to hospital it stops for a few days and it comes back so this time I went to a very big hospital and they told me I needed to be operated I didn't go for that operation money went like that the code kept disturbing me each time I hear someone has died and the issue started small I used to get scared but I was tired sometime I would go to hospital give me little medicine I take it it stops for a few days I got tired of medicine they told me to clean it I got tired so I said God I'm leaving this to you I can't do anything I've gone to hospital everything is still failing so I left I didn't do anything I never used to even clean it but I thank God I didn't do anything but last year God healed me my Cod is fine no longer feel any pain and I'm healthy in Jesus's name again again last year I faced a lot of challenges those challenges put me down and that's the time you start asking your faith you start that's the time I knew that I can't be safe because saved because my parents are believers I had a lot of questions in my head I had a lot of issues but I thank God that those issues have given me a step in the spiritual life and I believe like right what pastor preached in the beginning of last year he said we should do our best I as doing my best but challenges were increasing I think it was a test even though they all not done but I believe my spiritual life has increased and I believe that today the far was pushed away I'm going to the next phase amen I also want to bless God with this song I Want To Praise [Music] Him [Music] for [Music] see [Music] [Music] yes [Music] one [Music] single come one [Music] to [Music] where [Music] is [Music] God bless you Church Hallelujah we thank the Lord for that wonderful testimony and a special song you know most time if you are told that you're going to operated heals you brother Ian you come and give your testimony and then after brother Ivan sister EST and brother Peter requested to sing okay I think this one I don't know what it was for okay after brother Ivan sister Priscilla and sister Rachel you will sing your special God bless you church I I want to thank God I want to thank God for the many things he has done for me a few days ago I was in prayer and uh I felt a bit bad because God has done so much for me that I've thanked him so and so today I felt like maybe I should thank him bit more yeah it it all started when I got saved around 2019 I was in the medical school I never like medical so much but I was good at it and so when I got the message I stopped reading my medical books because I could read the message books Supernatural books and the Bible only and so my friends kept on worrying about me because they thought I would fail you cannot pass medical without reading very few people do it and so around two weeks to the paper it's when I realized that I I had very little knowledge of what you are supposed to cover and I was a bit worried my friends were a bit worried for me but I really thank go because I was in prayer and uh around two weeks to the paper I had I slept then God gave me the grace I was doing a paper and when I woke up I wrote all the questions that I was answering in the paper and so when I went for the paper it was exactly what i' had seen two weeks ago and when when the results came back I had a higher GPA than for my friends yeah so when the results came back they thought maybe I used to read but I used to lie them that I don't read but I told them I just go to church because I used to sleep in church and than good for that and when I finished my medical course over three years ago personally I've never looked for a joke and uh person personally my boss should not see this testimony they have never seen my papers even my ey7 theyve never seen it all the jobs I've worked in within these three years they just call me where you did medical when do you want to start working yeah so I I really thank God so much was all of them have never seen my papers all they know is I did some medical course but I work that's why I don't want my boss to see this testimony might he might ask me for the papers now but I believe good is the one who has been taking care of me and then this year I was in prayer and I really wanted something and it was costing a bit some money then I got something to do so I can pay it off but I was supposed to come to church again so I had to leave it then I came to church and then a few weeks after that there's a friend of mine who sent me a vure it's a supermarket vulture it was worth some good money so he told me I'm sending to you a vulture you can go to this supermarket and you get whatever you want for this am of money and so I received the vure then I went and I got whatever I wanted to get and yeah I I I really thank God for that and there are very many more things God has done for me that I would I would wish to share it some other time probably God bless [Applause] you praise the Lord oh what a testimony brother Ivan we thank God for that testimony reminded with one of one brother who gave us his testimony say that when they adverti for a job for him he had no papers what he did uh he put the Bible in the envelope and then he submitted his application so so everybody was interested to see the man who put the Bible in the envelope and ended up getting the job big job like yeah so Jesus Christ the same yesterday done forever so if we add that with brother Ivan's testimony then you can yeah our God is able uh sister Rachel and Mila you know it's like these papers have been confused because brother Peter will send a some of the song request we requested the previous Services if you still have paper there can give it the Deon and it brings it in front we still enjoying our time after this two uh sister oh sister mtha has a testimony after these two sisters they sister Matthew come and give your testimony and then sister we also have a special song and a testimony God bless you here I am to worship here I am to B here I am to say that you're my God you're all together worthy all together love all gave it

the Reas [Music] King inest [Music] you are the [Music] Reas see [Music] God bless you church happy New Year uh we are such a close team me and Diana um I want to celebrate the name of the Lord Jesus Christ when when I came here when I joined this church had already began looking for church from 2017 my getting out of church that is now the past but I came back to the message what set me running back to the message was the issue of children I have four children three girls and one boy I became desperate there were this past that going back to the world and I knew something was striking them to remove them from my heart when I came here I was desperate I was emotional I would cry and then what even spiked all this when I saw f but um I am grateful Fiona is back on track don't look theal side because it's going to come back if you had seen her three year about 2 years and N months ago I think she was clinically pronounced dead when I in she recovered all the systems recovered the brain actually had died the another system had failed she had a stroke and a paralysis and a blood clot instantly at a go so when you see her stand here she's a living [Applause] testimony then what sent me again was my first born and my second born B and my last Bor that gone was your backslide it was not beautiful at all for me as a mother but um they keep on coming for the message books at home I now see my son when he came back for holidays he knows what the message is It prepares him for the r when he told me that I knew go God is at work I was so seated in him a message player when the pastor Seated on my daughter a message player I also acted wise like a wise parent and seated on him he lives in Nigeria and um I know that God is at work now recently also my daughter came running she prays in St John Chira she said Mommy I've never seen such a lie where is the other Seven Seals I need to prove this I also gave it to her she's also reading it at a certain point even my last Bor was a pastor you people they ordained her that she was a pastor with Dominion City churches we went on our knees and she just she just walked away from church she now knows that women are not supposed to be pastors but anyway she's still out side there but that is not the pro the the concern the concern that I know is God will bring them back I've been in this church under the guidance of Pastor taloa it has been beautiful actually he's he's old like my first daughter know when I look at him I know that I'm sitting under the leadership of a son and I'm humbled as a mother uh it taught me how to pray I just I just had to to get back to where I used to be with Pastor John chakon and I just brought it forward and I'm I'm a better person today the way you see me I am no longer emotional I don't cry I am strong sometimes you know things happen around her life have learned to pray for her the days there would come maybe an attack I know I would want to see where where is the man of God to be called these days I have a solution I just lay her on my chest and we just cast out those things so it has been beautiful knowing all of you and we are here to stay until Jesus Christ comes for us God bless you so much I have a very big testimony but we are going to share it the way you've been seeing her healing slow slowly in bits that is how our testimon is going to come God bless you so much God bless you church thank you so much for all of you Pastor I love you I always tell genes I love says Mommy I think she thinks I don't know what she imagines when I say that I love the pastor so much so I love you all I wonder she imagin so um I want to yeah apologize for the sisters who who try and and reach up to me and when maybe we are greeting you know that part where they say uh greet your your neighbor and then someone is rushing very fast so my spirit fored someone wants to greet her so I just laugh about it I be like when pastor it's just a I'm decided to believe it's a phas uh it's it's nothing and that is always I tell myself that so my dear sisters I love you just reach up to my heart and hold me it's just it's it's just a matter of time and uh the testimony will be complete because I've been in prayer and surely God doesn't reveal so many things to me and uh I believe that when Pastor every time I I when I come to church and I'm very expected that it will be that day it's going today it's going be and I encourage myself so I I'm grateful this ministry ministers you you don't know what to do to me when I'm s there my chair there I get so blessed I get peace I get Jo you know Genesis always ask me mommy why do you laugh around and I told her because God has made me happy I made is everything and I believe that God allowed it to be this way so that he could receive all the glory of H to yes and um thankful for Divine Healing I eventually understood that mine is not a miracle like boom yeah yeah Holy Spirit what so I recogniz I've been recovering every day the things I couldn't do I know I like when like brother comes and say thank you for cleaning the house now move the house so I want it and I'm sure that it's clean and U and that is good for me because my nerves get better every day I recognize that the doctors took me of medication because of the strong medication and maybe once in a while I take something and I thank God so much for things that do failed to do and I I constantly get dreams when I'm being given medication and I used to wonder why I dream when dream drug so I at I never I had pain I would dream like I appreciate the power of God that passes through dreams and makes me feel by the time I wake up I'm strong and I have hope to be again yes so my testimony is that thanking God so so much for Divine Healing he has given me joy and peace and rightous God has really well us me concerning even the healing I don't want like every time so I2 because he has promised us healing yes and U thank you so

of happy New Year everyone thank God for bringing us to the new year but I fa to be unfair if I don't thank God for last year so what I have to thank God for is really a lot what has done for me a lot of things personally in me um maybe God has not used me to bless you yet but God has been working in me doing a lot of things changing a lot of things in me and helping me maybe what I can than good for is about my school so in and life wasn't easy I got tired of the school because I could not pray the whole time just all a month to be at school I struggle with my own prayers and then I get we in the middle something like that and I come back home when I'm dry then I start a fresh yeah the cycle continues like that every time from I think like from was but then I than that I finished and despite the mo I I still passed my so also uh going to a new school I'm still in a very strong Catholic school but nevertheless despite everything else um he has taught me a lot I have learned hard work I have learned um um how to be with people I've learned I've learned that when you want something you go for it so I've learned hard work and also I thank God for the friends I found there some of you saw my friend called Kagan so actually I had come for a movie but the movie found there I had already watched it at metrop so I told him to pass by but one thing about him is that he has always stuck around me I don't know why but I I could preach to him when we walking from class to back to host so tell him let's walk slowly I have something to tell you let's talk very fast I'm like take it slow so I would preach to him preach to him until reach that he like man prach that's how it was but I don't know why he he's not a Believer but he sticks around me too much he tells me all his plans what he has done like get me I don't even stick to him so I request so you should pray for him I don't know why he's sticking on Me Maybe maybe God needs to use him also I believe God can do something in his life I thank God for everyone was around me I've had people in my life who who are really blessed me thank God for shame his absence like when I'm at school I feel he's praying for me and prays everyone and also at school almost everyone knows sh like I talk about him every day when my friend came was like what shame and also Pastor sometimes so I thank God very much God bless you bless you Church good morning I want I want to thank God actually I I I I I wrote a paper I to give it so I gave it to give it gave it so it was good that wanted me to give this testimony Hallelujah I fa to give this testimony I was yearning for this day long long ago before even not yet God has really people God has been really good to me and whenever he could do something I could remember this that on that day I testify this okay I may have forgotten some because they were many but the the ones I remember I testify Hallelujah I want to thank God now me I will give because now me I consider all the past years as one year so as 2023 for the past years because actually I was baptized in 2023 so I consider all p as one so I want to thank God uh when we were entering sometime back I went to school and uh and I did my my my I did my certificate but when I no I first did my precour we were the Pioneers in the school then we started our certificates our Bunch when we finished our certificates they told us to upgrade to diplomas we didn't know what was going on because this was a new thing what what uh but then after the certific there was some issues and I didn't know okay even right now I ask why I didn't join I was giving an excuse that I don't have money so I didn't join to do my diploma they called me after to graduate what pained me that I was graduating a certificate and the friends and the people I studied with were graduating a diploma me I was graduating certificate but we start like we started in the same classes but I stopped at a moment then for them they continued and it was paining me for for some time I passed in through that year with that pain so when I entered 2020 2023 I thought yeah now I'm going to school but I had years that I'm going to school but when I don't know how am I going to school because the curriculum I'm using it's it's only this school that has it inand I can't go to any other school and it is so expensive so I was like now what what am I going to do when you look her this one is doing this the other one is doing the other one when you called the friends so I was really St and what I had in me I'm going back to school this year that 2023 so it came to uh actually we planned that I go back to AO AO came we came in the middle of the year in the middle of the like the year was ending and I was like H but you know maybe that's very I go next year so I was like canceling but I want to thank God that all in all people I went back to school and yeah even when I even when I went back to school things were not easy because this this is this was a thing that uh that had to be done in a big period of time like as I had planned to do it for that 2023 but I went almost when the year is ending so this people told me Dixon actually I was a special case at school so they impact me a lot of things because I think even them they had the vision that God has put in me that I have to finish it that very so they packed a lot of things on me they told me finishing it this year so I want to thank God that assessments were too much yes what what and you see they were giving me a lot of Assessments because I used to study with the students of a certificate and students of diploma sharing some units so you find that even when you're getting assessments these people of the diploma have two assessments even that the people of certificate have two two assessments but for you are doing all of them and they want them in the same week so and of which in the same week I I I used to come back here for every weekend so people used to to use that time of weekend to make what what but me I'm always here so things were not easy but God made them Hallelujah actually actually if I'm not if I'm not forgetting uh can I say last year yesterday at night when I was sleeping I was there and I I I remember that I Dre my that we had come back you know people you need to pray for me I dream that Mar had come back you see uh actually people thought because at school actually I was uh every time actually every time I had I used to give it for God like in the evening after classes we we uh there's some time for sports they told me Dix don't want to see you in sports for you have to be in the computer room only you actually there some moments when the school closes the computer room but for me they told me you have to be inside and do your work because me I used to have work already uh but there is this evening time after after after dinner so now that time people could use it to do some projects you know do their work uh research make researches watch videos on YouTube what what but now me I used to gather them and uh they tell me but now this is the time you could read you have to read your books now again you're using it in other things so I used to gather them get in the DH SE on a on a table and share Hallelujah so I want to thank God actually for that group of mind that I had uh they really they were really uh and I say people of God because whatever I could bring they could accept it you know sometimes when we have the message and you want to give it to someone you have that what do they accept what would they accept but whatever I could bring even sometimes I bring it out uh it all someone knocks out something that you want to bring out and then you are like oh wow so I want to thank God even for that bnch of mind that they were really touched okay um I want to thank God for for this for that first year that uh my life my life has really changed you know I was baptized by the way people me I was I was born in a Pentecostal CH my my parents were pcal yeah my parents were Pentecostal so I I was grown out in that so when I had this message and uh yeah I thought it's it's the it's the what actually when Pastor was giving a testimony about his life sometime he spoke and said when he was going to to to where he where I used to go for School in that family where he used to come from that uh his her mother told him that uh that uh where are you going those people have things they believe they believe this and this so it's the same thing that happened to me when I was coming uh when I was coming when I was coming my dad told me uh you going but those people believe this and this okay so that was my first time so when I came actually they told me the very things but now when they told me the things and the things were that message me when they told them to me I felt this is me this this is that these are the facts actually I was like the people didn't understand them well because when I went back after after getting off the body in fact even before greeting they was like you people did you understand the things then I started explaining like what I knew these [Laughter] people these people had that had the different mindset so I want to thank God that mine is again different from theirs so I'm different God bless you church happy New Year to you all I'm called Samuel and yeah I just wanted to give a a long testimony but I also don't know how long but I think it's long I want God for my life from let me sa okay I want to thank God for lot he has done in my life many protection this life that I have never know because okay me there are times when I like I can remember something that happened some time back and I'm like thank God that's why I think my testimony is going to be long because there many things you just reach a party then you remember like okay there are people who die at Young ages and me being here right now I don't know CU there are many things that have happened okay but another thing what I one than about is my school from when I started school I think they have never told me to go back home for school fees or every time when I go to school get almost every almost everything that I want and I go to school and I study and I thank God for last year yeah last year I was in form six was doing a hard combination yeah I papers of course okay I was being bi biology chemistry and math and for for math I used to like math chemistry that one you do not not very hard you do but now biology biology was natur as they had one but I want to thank God I thank God also for you people because you people prayed for me when you tached my the UN I did I did my un and papers are not that hard actually I believe in myself I perform just that I'm also still scared with the biology but I still I still have hope that yeah because what I did was okay then I want to thank God for my parents my siblings isy Mo I want to thank God for my friends my relatives and everyone the church because everyone has done something in my life they okay you can be here and you don't know what I'm thinking because I it can be here and maybe brother let me say brother did for me something like helped me I don't know how can I pay back but of course that is in my mind you cannot know so everything stays in right here then I want to God for the for the church uh we started coming here I think it was during okay that's when we joined Pastor was during and previously before we were in we used to pray with only believe and there would only

Sunday Wednesday Friday at least I I still hope for better I me I yeah I still hope for better maybe ending every time every time thank God also like when I come when I come like from school I come I feel like I'm going to church people are going to start saying this on like this like this I start feeling okay like I I don't feel okay in me but when I come here Pastor preaches every preaching like if he's talking about about me and but I thank God because he always says that he always says that the devil is tries to do what to the devil tries to make you think that the devil tries to make you
