[Music] so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so [Applause] so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so uh thank you is it uh um that's why went to the woman and seduced her someone wants to add on that read for me and rather than say that the serpent was close to human beings it was between the chimpanzees and then because it was that's how the supremacy do you have something you want to say yes by jesus ezekiel feel knowledgeable so they therefore saturn used use the serpent to bring uh to bring to bring his seed in the human race because therefore there is no way he was going to produce himself because he's also a spirit so he had to use something that is physical okay now i would like us uh to understand this part very clearly because it seems to me that people either not understand this part or their understanding of which is not food okay you need to have a full understanding of the good for you to be able to benefit to have the full benefits of it so i'd like us to look at i'd like us to look at the can you read from here is where yes how are you reading yes here is where we receive the tribulation okay now here he's explaining what exactly happened yes so can we now here the word says that he was okay so before you check this at any levels i want you to understand hey are you okay you don't seem to be you know by the way if anyone is not you you shouldn't really come to attend because you disrupt others now look uh from what it is that you are reading before we go to any explanation or deep revelations you need to first understand what took place like the brother joel was saying the first thing was to understand what the trees are yes what are the trees that were in the middle of the garden there were how many trees two trees the first tree is and the other trees of knowledge of good and evil so we have two trees one is the tree of life and then the tree of knowledge of good and evil now both these trees were in the middle of the garden but how are we able to know that of course i do not want us to go back in the bible with the old testament in the genesis and then we start reading that but i want you to understand it that uh uh just a moment for your understanding i think you might meet with that portion of genesis let's get there read chapter 2 verses 15 genesis and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree from the garden though may is freely eat but of uh once again but of the tree of the knowledge of wait a moment over every air in every tree out of the garden down my ears what trees are these and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden and dressed and keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden of that may is freely eat so now because i told you excuse me that a tree means person so someone is asking me are these also people that's a good question ain't it please open your mind now i want to bring this in a very simple way for you to understand and share this impossible so these people also know these are not people you need to understand that scripture has compounded meaning there is always the meaning that is meaning and then there is also another meaning that is more spiritual okay so many people can read the scripture and they take the meaning they are outside meaning which they see but then there is a deeper meaning there is a depth of revelation usually there is the me the other meaning that people just underlook and somehow they are not able to see it so i i expect this verse to be here because i'm still explaining so yeah it says at a tree but but of the tree of knowledge of good and hip okay and then of every tree of the garden that may is freely eat it so now this is talking or referring to the other trees which we are permissible to eat which ones are those those ones are the apples the mangoes the jackal fruit come on now bananas let us be realistic are you telling me that adam and eve were not eating they suddenly were eating okay but yes it is true they were eating those things that's what that that is what their food what their food was but then when you go to verse 17 are you following yes please that's less for us for us but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil read with me now thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou he destroyed amen but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of you so that's the only tree which he tells them do not eat the tree of the tree off yeah hey thank you some people thought that the tree of lord is one the tree of good is one the tree of evil is another the tree of knowledge is one and within it was good and if this is a tree is there one which was in the middle of the garden one of the trees which in the middle another tree which was in the middle of the garden was the tree where do we find that please [Music] just around there where he speaks about the tree of life okay i'm looking for it around probably okay let me get it from my baby [Music] the tree of life yes and out of the ground made their lord good to grow every tree that is listened to they said every tree that's the one that that's the kind of everything we're reading at first in the other part okay in chapter three where are we in chapter three verses okay uh-huh continue so this is a tree which was which the lord god made to grow the end was placed onto the site and good for food okay yes these were the ones i told you that they were brutal i'm speaking in ethiopia you know those other trees yeah those the names you mentioned those were the ones which were good for food and they were in the garden also the tree of life also individuals the tree of life also so now as he has mentioned the other trees he also goes ahead to mention the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and have you seen what i'm talking about so how many trees how many types of categories of trees one the second the third [Music] now the categories that we are looking at here are the last two categories because those ones were in the middle east of the garden it is saturday go down to verse 17. okay right there ah read verse 16. for you see yes so now it tells him this tree is not good for food don't eat it don't what and you can he says that the dead that thou shalt eat or beat that church so what is the tree now what is the street the first tree was the tree of life therefore the second tree is also a person yes if because these were the two trees in the middle of the garden the tree of life which is jesus christ and the tree of knowledge of good and evil that is the serpent all right not eve someone was telling me that that is evil no that is the tree of knowledge which has good and evil in it two things need good and bad who is that one that's the devil amen uh-huh so i want to show you now scripture to prove that amen okay go to genesis 3 1. now the serpent was more subtle than the beast than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said that to the woman yeah god said him shall not eat of every tree of the garden and the woman said that to the sabbath we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said he shall not eat of it neither shall we touch it did god say that we should not touch it but it is if who is emphasizing that we shall not even touch it but god said he should not eating period you should not you will not eat the fruit of it but you said you shall also touch it so okay so here the bible says genesis 31 says what is that genesis 3 1. can you read that yes now the subject was more subtle than any beast of the field the subject was more subject very intelligent very cunning than any beast it was also a beast people i wanted to follow me here this is a very important subject and i don't want you to misunderstand me if you understand it today you're going to explain it to your friends in a very good way that's right it will even make them really need this message okay so follow me cause if you have your opinion and you're ready it will be good for you right number one we have what are the coverage the tree of life was jesus christ was god the free of knowledge of good and evil we are trying to establish who it was now i want you to separate two things here before we even go into this tree because it sometimes may seem as if it is one but also it is different or separate two things one mr serpent who is a beast and mr serpent who is that who is the devil are two separate things who understands it raise up your hand okay good shame how many explanations are fortunate the spirit that use that one the flesh is the least yes before we even continue people please follow me this is a very critical study mr serpent the beast was not a snake he was not as a problem snake he was a beast read three one again now the serpent was muslim still than any beast of the field so god is categorizing mr and among uh beasts not reptiles that's right is not a beast that's true god is categorizing mr serpent among the beasts so mr serpent forget about that his name sounds like a snake he was not a snake he was an upright beast we have beasts like lion uh-huh abs uh-huh what are the characteristics of a beast sister rachel what are characteristics of abyss number one the mind might not have fun right i just don't have fire not all of them are fun really don't they yes yeah but not all of them are right that i want real characteristics yeah well yeah yeah this is wild because of the fall before the fall it wasn't really white uh-huh volumes yes that's the first one the first characteristics of a base is that it has four limbs what does that mean some may wonder what i read what the what do they mean by limbs it means it has some why do we call it limbs and no legs or hands because sometimes others may only use use through other hand as hands and they do like a what is this is it opposite mother of some you know the opposite they can walk with the two and sometimes they can yeah so you can see that uh it's the beast but it has two four limbs but we are not saying four legs or fronts but it can be legs all of them or it can be two legs and like you you can set walk like a car or if you want but the issue is you have four limbs okay so this beast was also having full names like all the others another characteristics wait before we go there now because that's a bit different okay i'm talking about all this uh-huh another characteristics of this they produce they can reproduce they can reproduce they met with the females and they can bring forth life okay so they have a seed if they're males or they have eggs if they are females we understand that yes uh-huh another catalyst of the of this okay then another one okay fine right now we are going into the science okay but okay but i wanted they kind of eat yes they eat and excrete huh what's another characteristic okay fine you have had all those characteristics this mr serpent was a what it means doing all these things that's the second week mr servant was a beast and there is something different on mishappen from all the other beasts that were in or in the in the garden it says that he was the most subtle he was the wisest he was the cleverest he was the most intelligent he was very kind he was very wise you understand you could even talk hallelujah today we have beasts but some of them can't talk like a chimp kind of can achieve talk actually a champ already is waiting to talk but you can do everything and everything i was watching the other day a video on youtube someone i think one day he was with a champ and then he ready to go to the wild and then he went in the wild after some years to reunite with it to like uh get back to eat and they become you know to meet you and greet it like that so when he went there they weren't safe they wanted him he said don't go there this thing they come here kill you now now it is white no it is from when it was a baby so you would not give so he went there in the wild and he found it there and the thing after a long time it came and then when it saw him it went to him and hugged him he did give you what is that this is even have affection they understand like human beings almost they they cannot talk because they cannot talk but this one mrs happened who was talking even hey this mr happened but i'm actually if you were reading here he says it was almost you know talking it had a space even for a soul but it never had a soul that's right the only thing which the pirate said from a human being is that it never had a soul but the rest of the things that human beings there are many animals that today manifest those characteristics that i'm talking separately but all those characters were on one beast and distribution was in the garden yes with even adam and everyone else so it was an animal didn't that be the problem you understand it's not a devil you know it was just around did you have an issue you get the point yeah but where the problem came from is when mr saban from heaven came down amen are you following me go to your book of revelation so that whatever we are reading you can't know we are not getting it from our own ideas we're taking it from the bible revelation chapter 20 chapter 12 verse 9. can you read someone who is there please quickly and a great job was cast out that will suffer that old world old serpent devil saturn great dragon you know all are his names he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him yes so kareena will see the old the other side that i'm talking about he came from where from heaven who is he that there but he that all happened saturn he was cast down from heaven and he did not come along he came with many of his angels and remember they were spiritual beings they were not having a body like us so tell me where do you think mr suffolk would have gone after he was cast out from heaven please can we can we take it from the bible from our idea into the earth yes which particles place in on the earth yes if whoever says that you must be sure to show it to us in the bible where did he go to in the earth sister peace when he was cast down from heaven he came to the earth where in america or in uganda iraq where can you prove to us please please prove us by the bible god bless read now come on [Music] who is he talking about here of course up there was talking about the king of china so some people will say the king of some certain place but i wanted to see the way he describes him are you following people by the way you would take notes on these things i can also you can be able to read reread them and understand them very well and also be able to share with your friends okay so we're starting some don't even know where we are put that screen for them so they can be able to see the vents okay that has been where in eden brother billy paul what is happening please read with us can we then be in the same spirit okay all of us together one two three god and then he begins to talk about all those precious stones yes sister rachel you are lost completely when ezekiel as i care chapter 20. are you there now yes are you there now hey some of you don't even have to open your bibles you are there okay can you read for us verse 13 huh that has been in eden and then he says he was created down there as you finish the workmanship of the tab rates and of that was repaired in a day in a day that thou wast so this is not psy a man on earth because this one was created he is an angel that's how we are able to know but also we find out he was also in heaven the god of god are you hearing yes but let us know what you read this is what you can be sure that he was an angel verse 14. foreign have you seen that yes so where was he also on the on in heaven in the holy mountain of god and he was the anointed you know you know there are many types of angels i care about this one over six weeks yes yes six weeks he can he asked you for flying to cover his feet and to wash me and he is always the presence of god this one was one of the generals okay that's how we were able to know that he was on the mount of god that's why he was so proud and he felt like oh my i should really go higher so that i can be good and he yeah yeah you know you people we can also make our own kingdom yeah you know selling the angels there angels angels there come on i can't believe god can't you see i am more powerful i can't even sing you know and then you know he showed up and everything ah we can make it and and when god saw that he said michael said michael can finish it go and deal with it so he came down with also his army of angels i'm imagining what was what it was like in heaven oh god was also faced with rappers one time my god he was first with the rebels who wanted to recover his kingdom this thing you are saying here on earth did not begin on he said michael yes my lord go and finish it up michael came and he flies around there and you know and then and then lucifer also name it is says very very well what was in him [Music] the anointing he was not just killed but he was anointed and i have said this so god has made him like that that was upon the old has walked up and down in the midst of the storms of fire michael you don't know what i can do he said okay you come bring it on they said i said michael you know i have almost three quarters over the whole heaven enjoy they came and they but the ground was drawn and they started hitting one another hit one another i tell you there was really war in heaven up in the dragon he goes in the dragon because you are now a kind of uh rebelled against what was the status quo in heaven you know so they said you know started rebelling and they were fighting on these angels also they kept they fought when michael you know you know yesterday now i'm going to throw you on he threw him down on the earth and he came on the earth that all happened lucifer the devil that all happened he came now he was in heaven but he came now down to the earth are you seeing now this one is unfolding yes read verse 15 thou was perfect in thy ways from the dead was created [Applause] finish it up for me [Music] so in other words lucifer was perfect and dear someone seen something if you have seen it say amen amen what have you seen tell me what you'll you see are you connecting scripture are you studying scriptures oh you're just doing each group that is benedict yes god bless you and what goodness that perfection that is good is it yes yes so how do you summarize so what do you see there two things can we go back to our servant in genesis yes not even suffering the dream hey is someone getting the revelation now the tree of knowledge follow me look at me here the tree of knowledge oh and that was perfect in his way until we have found him we have found him my friends here in ezekiel 28 yes he is now telling us which tree of knowledge was the tree of knowledge is that all the serpents not the the suffering in the garden of heaven but that all happened bro that was the tree of knowledge sister peace which one we have two seconds here from where yeah ah you mean the three of us happened i was living in heaven thank you for trying sister you see so that's happened came down from heaven and he where did he go now it's okay where we have been executing where did he go that's why i said you should have absolutely we are progressing our study one the dream of knowledge of good and evil though the dream of life the tree of life was a person which was jesus christ and the tree of knowledge of good and evil was also which was the devil himself both of them were in the midst of the garden and god told them this we should not eat this honey should not work now a serpent the devil is the one that they were not supposed to eat meaning follow me please follow me quickly look at me here now we have the tree of knowledge of good and evil but when we are not supposed to eat it but the other trees including the tree of life they were supposed to eat so now the question is how are they eating the tree of life if you know they were eating the tree of life you will be very aware how the tree of knowledge and evil was eaten [Music] that is a very good point can you expound on it how are they in the tree of life they would accept the idea and let it work what is the idea what do you mean um who is disagreeing why have you not agreed fully because hey they say that let us look at the tree of life now how can you eat this one this way and this way you must eat it the same way yes so maybe you have a wrong understanding let us first look at the way they added your life on how was it eaten because like you've got a very good point you cannot eat this one this way and the other one another way it has to be in the same way of eating uh-huh amen god bless you your idea is the same as his only the other brought in a very liberal way and you wrote in a very a religious way but it's all the same to this to accept an idea to accept what someone has presented to you and make it part of your make it control your life to believe the words you have had i love that one to believe the ones you have had right now you're very busy eating hey you didn't know you're gonna be eating now that is why someone could look at and say oh you have changed what is happening to you and you tell them these days you eat well yes i eat you well look at my chicken because you have been eating food or you have been eating so even spiritually you have been eating that's why some of you have lost appetite for your friends that you had i believe there are some of you who have lost at least even up there for the things you used to do why are you losing appetite you know if you were poor and you were eating only in vineyards then when you become rich in the guillotine chicken and the salsa is the pod chicken when begin eating he sponsor faster food you lose the appetite of the ava you gotta pray these people what happens yeah these days kfc you understand because you think you have money you understand yes so when you eat something you become something yes what you we are what we eat the way we look is because of what we eat i remember when i was too young i was really tiny like this i wasn't married sometimes i would go up to school meals i won't eat you know i was like very tiny like this but when i got married my wife cooks me for me breakfast lunch have a breakfast lunch and suffer sometimes i even have to strike and stop eating so i can you know you understand so you we are what we eat yes a very fat man with a better protruding stomach and then you tell him brother are you sick no it is what he's eating you get a point so friends eating what is eating that's a very good one now brother even if we finish what do we eat how do we eat when the three of us came on the earth did he ever tell us to eat it yes yes yes yes yes you are remembering now you're seeing now when the tree of life came in the earth what did you say no no don't just say show us in the bible you know you need to you need to know where these things are so what you can what did you say no not look at this what is talking about know where these scriptures are or else they never will ever come yeah please can someone read for me john 6 51 quickly now this is i am amen he himself the tree of life shouts and proclaims i am the living brain amen this is the brother of heaven where am i before my evil may not die i am the bread of life hallelujah i am the living bread something really brother if any man eat of this bread if any man eat of this bread you shall live forever he shall be foreign oh my jesus christ and the bread that i will give is my flesh oh is my flesh is my what which i will give for the life of the world don't eat me my flesh i don't drink my blood you are dead you don't have even healing life in you why because i'm the tree of life whosoever eats my flesh and it drinks my blood has life and i will raise him up at the last day for my flesh read with me verse 25. for my flesh is made indeed and my blood see that it's my flesh and drinks my blood in me friends if you have seen it you would be rejoicing right now crap with your hands and shouted hallelujah have you seen it who is the flesh christ he is flesh and his blood he says he's drink his bacon food but the question is some people are cracking their eyes wide in their mind they remember jesus who was walking on the streets of jerusalem if that's what you grabbed your hands before please first wait to trap until you hear and receive the perfect reservation the flesh we are talking about they may be talking about is not the meat you know you know walking in jerusalem and you know his blood which was going through the veins which by now is very very dry when spilled on the cross it dried up didn't it yes so what what's life where is life in that brother somewhere where is life in that you may say brother sister the flesh the flesh is talking about is here in the form of the word [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah he shall have a balancing life in the bible say that he doesn't hear him my words and he believes given the scripture he and the believers he shall have everlasting life who said that the tree of life and remember the spirit the blood is talking about he's talking about the spirit that's right hallelujah when you receive the word of god you are saved until the day of your redemption so in other words it's talking about receiving the word believing the word and receiving the baptism of the holy ghost when you believe the word and if you see them so the holy ghost you are already eating and enjoying the tree of life ada was kicked out after they ate from the other wrong tree he was kicked out of heaven and they were they were chest out of the garden that was the atmosphere of friends please listen to me now you don't miss this point yes why were they chased out they were just out so that they don't have access to the trio right so that if they eat it they will have eternal life so therefore they were supposed to be chased out because that means everyone has sinned and there is no one who can have it in life anymore so from that time their life was cut off from the people but when jesus came hallelujah his blood restored everything his blood restored the access in the tree of life hallelujah he has now come as i am from heaven even when the peace of me shall and what is that is the what so we are yet no wonder sometimes you will hear the word you can feel street and feel happy why because you are eating yes hallelujah because you are eating i don't know if you hear this while you get bored let me tell you there is a wrong wrong problem with you there's a very very big problem with you if you ever hear the word there is a big problem on you as a matter of fact you might even be i don't want to say what but in the sin of god amen the word should make you happy the world should make you excited the world should even make you talk tongues the wife should make you shout they want to make you amen there's a stop button you know when you receive this one you hear it and you enjoy you know you can't have a stop button someone even if they try to stop you will say me at all let me rejoice hallelujah when jesus was here on earth they tested some people tested of that bread of life some were healed from their sicknesses eyes were delivered from there whatever that's what the view of life does when you hear the word you believe it when you receive the word of god you will be sealed tree of life and it therefore it must change your life from inside out let me tell you you can never lie to me that someone can hear this one and they remain the same after two months three months four months six there is no change that one forget it don't even reach them leave them around this one it must change you you must be able to say all of you at your level that i am no longer what i used to be if you can't say that then there is a big problem with you if the things that you should overcome between the uh i'll not say 20 years outside five years ago if they feel that you should have become five years ago overcoming you there is a big problem so you better believe it and begin to be changed now you see yes what is it is the tree of life so [Applause] hallelujah in the evening time it shall be light how she was coming down who is the light jesus the light of the world he was coming down every evening and pushing preaching to them and they were better there in the garden of amen amen amen then he goes back he comes back again next evening amen every evening he was coming to check on them and whenever he was coming he was speaking revealing himself to them and they were saying amen what is it the truth of eating it by the saving amen you eat by receiving an idea you keep by believing what someone else is telling you amen so if you eat bad stuff if you eat lots of stuff if you eat practice if you eat that that's why the things that you you you watch on your whatever you are eating my sister oh people don't give this thing i don't want to go i would be end up being preaching now but i'm telling you that this thing you know you're going there in the on youtube on this and nearly beginning what you're watching those things and then you know what i'm gonna do but i'm just seeing what you should not eat those things if you you eat those you know if you eat those women bouncing bouncing themselves like that you also begin because if the bible says there in somewhere he says they have a name that they leave but yet they are dead amen the church many of them are calling themselves christians you think they are their christians because of the outlook but actually inside they are dead muslims what happened am i eating so friends eating the hearing believing hearing organizing and acting hallelujah so if you hear the things of the world and you organize it and you actually you will become like the world and if you hear the word of god you recognize it you will act like a child of god like a son of god hallelujah eating his acting yes my brother is not eating his wife that is eating don't try to confuse people that is eating eating is hearing and acting everything else comes out of that hallelujah because you're eating the word of god it's your life you really stop doing that why because you have heard yes hallelujah why would a woman become you know what why would they say a woman is expecting because she is she have she recognized she acted you got a point three things hearing recognizing acting are you understanding now yes so when you hear the word of god you recognize it you will act upon it is when she had the suffering now here is our place now there was two serpents the suffering on earth and the serpent frog this happened on earth and the serpent in heaven connived they agreed actually it was even more of an argument it was more of a hijack i've ever seen someone like that with someone hey you know someone when you find someone going before they get to their sister before they are married it means that that person is attacked by the devil the same way they never adapted that's happened when you come out of are eating doing don't you see any of them what was it that made you believe it's the devil right because they don't want them to be cast out and they never confused to be their friend and they never connected you see the devil spirit the devil is not afresh and blood you understand yes so the subject which came from heaven he comes down and enters into this serpent which was on earth it was a very gentle man by the way it was a gentle manner if you allow me to use that one there was no beast or any more closest to the human beings like it yes it would talk reason you understand i'm also more importantly he had a seat the goddess brothers he harvested going to select all of you brothers here have a seat sister does not have a seat brother when love made the seat you plant it in the garden what happened so this is uh that the subject had they never knew that and here now this the mystery is here the world thing is here they never knew i record the other surface the dev one this one i will call himself okay the devil knew yes are you following me yes the devil knew saturn that devil that what's happened he knew that would be mr serpent they never knew some of you have even gone away i have not gone now it isn't good you're following me look the devil knew that that this serpent's seat yeah can be able to mingle to unite with this with the egg of the woman to bring forth a child he never knew that there was very strategic in his attack that's why he came that happened first before he came to anyone he didn't want to scare him away because he was a spiritual if he hadn't even be achieved and even in any case if not he cannot enter evil adam because even adam had something which was protecting them does anyone know it that thing i'm going to talk about it on sunday what gives me grace and i'm prepared for it i'll talk about it on sunday anyone knows it so what okay now let me be hanging there as a question i'm going to deal with it on sunday so i want to be you all right i'm going to talk about it the whole service understanding what they had that affected them from the devil not incarnating them because they were not engaged even you today because of that all right leave that aside now eve follow me now eve this surprise was just there and the devil came here that is like they never entered those places and then they went straight in whatever you understand itself yeah you know how men do when they're going to attack you know so yeah you understand say arrived this happened realized that he has now gotten even new ideas which he had never gotten before you get a point yes so the servant realized he had been educated by something in evernote's troops something a story that can do this you know those ones those people who date women they realize they have got a new idea which they have not thought of before so this happened they never came in it and don't leave something you know what actually this eventually you can say okay fine so when something became sappet was not acting on its own accord that's why i feel sorry for something because serpent was a victim of circumstances you know something was not a problem this snake you see today it wasn't a problem that's why snake doesn't usually bite children but if you are double it will bite you you know children he knows this one i don't know what happened but this big one they know and they wouldn't even kill you on the scene but you can find a snake playing the child today and it is not biting these things no it is nature what happened here is what happened i'm telling you what happened so this servant now realizes that you can talk to eve talks so the ability object was already there that bit of reasoning was already there it was very kind of very wise then the devil came and connected it and gave it a mind a mindset so to come and be queen that's the one that the bible used big will do what you know what they really mean yes but do you understand yes yes what is the greedy i don't want to use that one yeah presenting a manifesto to something you are not making it again whether it is dramatic do you know what it is you know sister someone looks and he says hey you know you're beautiful [Music] then you begin you get something you begin to do it you know you know i love you you know when you hear that you're like you had war then you begin getting those filthy ideas in your age when that begins then it says no he said no i will not do it no please if you do it no i'll be comfortable even if you do not please leave me alone you know that kind of thinking that kind of ideas this is exactly what happened with the serpent now what was the eating that if that is the point of coming to when the serpent came to eat he was very naive and some of you now are running into some other words he was very happy that is the it is the truth it was very nice she did not know anything because she was just told don't do that it is bad just like you tell children don't do that it's what you train a child and you know that's it so god told them don't do that don't go that age because it's bad so they never for her maybe she even added not not to touch in a guru spirit you know that area not even you know meaning it is not um but because she was too excited to defend what god said she was she added on the world which is the reason why god said that women should no longer preach that's the reason by the way even when you check in the new testament in second timothy the first time of the chapter 2 where i said women should not preach he brings that issue do you want to check it yes that's right yeah check it out someone said i want to be only for you to continue the other story i'm coming back yes let the woman learn in some read why have you seen it now so that is the reason because he was deceived with a big wheel yes you know that's why you guys you know these boys of the world come to you again this man used the word who was there that one [Music] [Music] now you agree they begin saying baby data was vibing me how can you sell you such ones those are worldly words they should not even enter your mouth i've used it for the sake of people here here but that is not right you know you begin saying i am what do you say instead of what should they say what dating dating brothers also please please give some of these rewards leave them alone leave them to those who own them be a christian even in your mouth okay let your mouth be creased by the word by the word and the word the holy spirit also by fire enters your mouth you cannot say some of these words amen so listen what was i saying so sister some of those men they come around you they begin now speaking such a bad words you know they bring an idea and then you know it's the wrong idea and you don't believe in it don't even give them time to discuss don't give it attention at all that's right because if you do you already created the away they will know even if you just ah leave me alone they will know hey no problem tomorrow you will say ah leave me alone the next day they will do the same thing they did because they will know that this man happened if they don't have the holy ghost they all know hi she will come to dance then he would begin promising you you can't do this then another day when they promise more things that leave me nowhere did you notice that's right facility was very high there he went on going down going down and teaching you know don't give them your time eh don't give them your time sister not allow these boys to you know we talked about the virtues there to disintegrate your virtues actually touching your body that's not right your body is not what your body is not a toy where everyone goes and you know some evil god they mess up everywhere your body is the temple of the lord amen it should be cherished hallelujah even you brother but the sisters god is special more than yours so if you're not allowed it's not a garbage you can't wear someone just comes in there you don't know their hands are having devils or not not levels they just you accept it that you also feel you know don't allow that kind of thing because you are a child but you have daughter of god amen you are going to heaven and your body is for you and the lord amen and when you get a husband for you and your husband hallelujah and before then it's for you and lord only a girl who allows a boy or a woman who allows a man to touch them or not they are husbands it means they themselves have problems okay actually that's why in the old testament i will take these things off one of these days in the old testament the bible tells us if a girl was arrested and she did not make an alarm they would stone her and the one was ripped they would watch the mission today because even now why did she make an alarm that you overcame you overcame me how could you ever why didn't you allow which means you were also part of what was happening you you you are enjoying the moment you understand so you should not you must always defend what is right and fight for what is right amen am i making sense in what i'm saying yes okay now this assad i hope you're following very well i just have prince i don't know someone called prince here i don't know if you're a real prince and then it's the priest and then sister alinda i hope you're also following because this is a very very sensitive subject now please can can you let not let this student stopped are you following me yes yes here we are the devil comes the devil because i'm saying that but really it's not the devil in in and it begins throwing those words uh if uh uh says uh mrs adam because she was woman which it means mrs other man part of a woman did god say that you shall not eat of all the kids in the garden what did she say what did she answer don't read we already what did she answer yes god said we should do it but he what does he mean his meaning god said we can eat everything but we should what he said we should now in this case let me rephrase this word what god said we should be here recognize and believe anything else but i mean believe every hear recognize and believe everything else but from him alone what he has told us he said we should believe it and nothing else and he told us not to believe anything yeah [Music] this tree they were eating the freeze the fruit of the tree what is it what is fornication what is about what is theft what is lies what are these things fruits of sea fruits of unbelief so the sin is unbelievable so what the god taught them not to do is not to unbelieve the word god told them to believe everything you're saying and not to believe anything else you understand so what did they do if she started hearing and trying to believe what someone else was saying that is the mistake she did so everything that came was as a result of that so what was the forbidden what the what is the forbidden fruit the forbidden fruit was hearing recognizing and acting on something that would be originated from god hearing another that was even called himself after he preached he said may i preach to you christ but if you read another come and preach another gospel that to you then whatever you let him be a cast that god said if you eat of it you are cast you're going to die okay so that is exactly the forbidden fruit the forbidden fruit is hearing another gospel are you hearing me now yes now another gospel can make you do anything and therefore the other gospel made her eventually entangle herself in adultery okay so adultery came as a result of her eating the wrong thing from the wrong tree eating from the wrong tree so the adult she was afraid from the wrong tree so she took the fruit and ate she accepted to commit adultery that's what it means she took the fruit and ate that's why the bible says that soul is the way of an adulteress woman she is and website and says i've done no evil but what is the eating of another woman it is committing adultery not sin it's committing what's adultery yes of course we have children here so i'll just keep it at that okay so adultery is engaging with another man that's not your husband oh and and then you um you ma your fat your father you understand so eve from that very moment she might have a sacred but you remember as venezuela has not even touched her yet so she might have version first with the suffering and when adam came the father says that she ate associated also listen to this now we ha he ate also with her so it wasn't something that was done by an individual it was done by two people at the same time together so here it also shows you that what she did with the devil she repeats with her husband but in this case it was her like treating the husband so what i want to say is the the the scripture is very very clear that the eating is hearing recognizing and acting yes and after she ate that idea the wrong ideas would go back to the first point after she had the wrong ideas she was so full of it that she partook over the use of those wrong ideas and practiced it hearing recognizing and acting she had a wrong opinion she asked she said she she had her opinion she recognized that it is good it is good for food and prison for the eyes and then she also did what she acted by committing adultery so that about today we always call it the original sin the original meaning the sin which was done first and belief was unbelievable refusing to believe the word right but that refused to believe the word resulted into a boundary so the the sea that is there in the world is only one but the man of warrior says that he's unbelievable why do you do the bad things that you do because you have the you know the truth not that you don't know but you refuse to believe it you decide what you just haven't you do it i will repent you do it i will do that and you do it you still you you fornicate you do that do that that is the original scene we're going to see is because you have refused to believe the word of god how many have seen it when next you are preaching this to somebody do not make a whole lot about the act make a whole lot about refusal to believe the world that is where the point lies then the act is the one that brings forth cain now the act is not bringing forth cain and he is lying of unbelievers yes because that is the sacristy now that's where it comes from are you seeing it yes hallelujah amen what was officially asked yes tree of life that is the point i'm coming in remember the way you eat the tree of life is doing with the tree of knowledge same way hearing believing recognizing and acting same way but the results differ you get a point now i'm going to show you two images it is even here where i'm talking about what is already here talk about it here let us continue let us continue we are going to get the answer uh yeah pick it quickly now everybody get me that brother i want us to conclude this protein reading again from here yeah man is smart that's one of the mysteries of god that he that has remained given by his will have you seen it now man and animal did mingle now why did no man and the devil please if they shouldn't interrupt him test them out i want you to follow okay why did the prophet here say that man did he say man and a certain mingle because i cannot have children because saturn is an angel it's a spirit yes the sea was of the serpent you understand the seed was a physical sea of a physical animal which was there when god because it's a physical animal they never remain his time is coming his time is not yet you remember when jesus met that demon in kadara they told him our team is not yet for you to understand this message you need to know the bible you read the bible don't just keep it as a textbook you have encouraging us read excuse me get to know the bible respect the bible you know get to know you don't find it you put it under them you buy more other books on top of it let me be on top of everything even islam in islam i want to put something above the quran am i not right yes you cannot do that but you find christians some i found someone reading their bible there and they're sending someone drinking for me in the house how can you be so careless please if look this one is putting his bible down on the floor is doing that how can you feel such so careless like that put in the back of the phone you can do that even your money you can put on the floor if you are if you have the thunder here can you put you on the floor you cannot because you expect someone may check the room so please hold those bibles with value with much regard your phone you can throw the floor in the sound of you when i drop you you just go and keep your phone and you you you because you cherish it what's your bible huh yes friends i'm sorry i'm not just trying to embarrass but i'm hungry spiritually angry it's not acceptable you take your body you leave it somewhere it's like carry for me go on the binder it goes back to our values what we hold dear please respect the word of god respect the bible don't get it and then you put you know things in it put your pain inside you put this inside hold it dear to your heart and also read them every day and meditate a point every day so that when we come to things like this it's easy for us to just cross and we go so now i'm reminding you something you don't even know okay what is that some of you behave as if you know yet you have never even heard of it okay there is that man who was a demon possessed in the garden in the tombs and then jesus came and those demons shouted from him he said please don't kill us it's not our timeline so that therefore knew is what he's doing yet so in the garden the god did not cast the suffering but he the devil but he cast the serpent he cast mr serpent on the earth that guy there he had his arms and his legs all disappeared and he became a snake now as we know it but before that happened he's a seed and they and the human being they mingled together and they formed a child so there's a connection between animals and the people and people don't know that's why they also form the teaching of evolution which states that man has was an animal but he went on evolving changing into a human being that he was like this you down if that is the case why are we not still changing what happened why not still changing so that is completely filthy through the doctrine filthy teaching filthy science and finding and it's only because they they have not been revealed what we know this teaching is only in the message i had this question before i did the message and when i received this teaching in the message it settled me i always ask my what was the original scene they don't know i wanna please told me they hate and happen let me tell you and yes yet yet these things the the scientists and the you know the movie stars the hollywood keeps making movies out of it the devil knows you got a point yes the devil knows what happened but people don't know the religious men don't he said it's shocking the bible says that the devil knows that there is one god do you believe this one god right yes and he never believes it too and even trembles our teeth you tell him there is one god in heaven his name is jesus he believes but the pistol today they don't that is how deception is the devil has deceived them so much that they give something that the devil himself doesn't believe they believe something that they never himself doesn't what now the devil believes serpent seed the the people the the the christians they don't they don't even have an idea the man and animal mingle together only in this message thank god for this message hallelujah that is one of the mystery of god that has been has remained hidden but here it is revealed it happened right back up there in the middle of the head and when you've turned away from the life to accept f hallelujah you saw where it happened yes all right notice what god said to them in the garden of eden genesis 3 15. i need someone to help me read please i will put an enmity where it's in the church edible so you might as well just continue with it someone if you can help me read if i read as well as explain i'll get some time and i will put an enemy between thee and between the sea i can see you see yes between the woman is the man is said and her of course we know that the woman herself doesn't have seed okay he's talking about that that's it which will come out of a woman without the help of a man there would be a woman that would rather see without manny's intervention that is talking about okay it shall breathe bruise thy head and though shall we put with his feet if we give credit to the world that the woman did have the seed then the serpent must have surely had a sea ocean if the seed of the woman was a manchester apart from the man oh then the seed of the sabbath please please if god can show you this one i'm going to be happy all these labors will be not in pain is the core point here all of us will let us read it together one two three go [Music] okay others we are sleeping have you seen where we are one two three go if the seed of the woman was wait what does it mean one clever student yes what does it mean it means that it's the devil okay leave the if talk about the statement leave this if talk about the statement what was the seeded woman the seed of eve the seed of the woman that the bible speaks of in the book of genesis it's jesus but i wanted to explain this fact anyone who can do that what does it mean that the city of the woman was a man checked apart from the man what does it mean it means you see how you know people are born you know you have to have a daddy and mommy it's the same way we have children but it's not the seed of the woman will not be without would be without a physical meaning there would not be that there would be a child beautiful come here quickly huh come with the book give me the book there will be a woman you're not a woman you're a man of course but i'm just explaining that one time there would be a woman that would become pregnant with a child yet this child does not have a father from earth that is what it means the seed of the woman the seed of the woman would mean a child born without a man touching that is what it means a man child apart from meaning among child without money's innovation without sex then the seed of the serpent will have to be the same pattern what does it mean the seed of the serpent will also have to be without the let's dress the slope let's go slow you have to be a woman giving birth to a child but in this case also without a human male or father same pattern you're following me now yes are you telling me that cain was fathered by adam that means that cain for that father but not from this earth or i would rather say not a human male okay yes let us take it slower now and that is another male must be born apart from the human male instrumentality there is no student who does not know that the seed of the woman was the christ who came by the instrumentality of god okay apart from the human intercourse that is jesus came apart from without human intercourse it is also just as well known that they predicted the reason of the serpent is head was in the actuality of was an actuality a prophecy concerning what christ would accomplish against the cross when jesus went on the cross and by his death he bruised the head of the serpent there at the cross christ would grease the head of the saturn while saturn will break the hill you remember how he was pierced how they put even a nail in his legs and nailing his hands you know how they breached him but in the same way he also breached the head they raised the heel on him but he breathed he finished him once and for us now follow me god would have a baby without touching a woman okay yes you only spoke if i shout please take care don't worry i'm just feeling fire now in my heart i'll speak this mary had a baby in the stomach but the thing that gave her this baby was god how and she said what she said what he said what brother be it unto me according according to your word that is how it was supposed to be even in the beginning woman yes i just feel like having a baby brown eyes [Music] that's how we were supposed to be born but eventually we were born about it because of what the devil the serpent introduced the intercourse in the garden of eden but here god came to correct everything by jesus when he saw mary he spoke and his word created of the seed and his word created the egg in the womb of mary following now there was another woman hallelujah rather standard there was another woman i wish you'd be able to capture this you're not very active my hand right so this one is very fast i don't want to stand because i i i want people to see me and what i'm doing here and can you look this side can't decide yes thank you bro don't worry i don't want your face i don't want your stomach there was another another woman and this woman please can you follow me yes this one he only spoke a while and it happened when it came to another one this one was speaking who was speaking who was speaking it was god or the age of god it was god speaking let us say it was god because it came god came by the end right yes now so we noticed that this one god spoke and she became pregnant and and and she did not have a baby without a man ever touching her she just touched herself and realized that the baby was being formed but this one eve in the old testament at first was called a woman being a part of a man when the serpent came to her the serpent spoke like god spoke not so yes they suffered convinced eve the woman like god confessed like god wants to marry are you following me but here is the difference when god finished convincing me because she said i will need i will let it be then going to convince her more and he said the holy spirit will overshadow you she said amen are you following yes but when it came to men to eve when she said god said we should say don't worry and she was eventually there convinced excuse me if you tell me that mary i mean that if had a baby of the serpent like eve had a baby of mary it means that the serpent can create because remember only god is the word kind of creates he could only speak the word and and mary become pregnant but the devil could not speak only the word he spoke the word but his word was as powerless as the word of a eunuch amen do you know who are you not peace is a man who doesn't have sea who can have children so the devil's word is as far as as powerless as a word of a unit that's why never allow the devil to deceive you never allow the devil to deceive you because you see when it saves you you will die i'm telling you even your sisters don't allow those many without christ to deceive you and put you in shambles to put you in trouble they will deceive you but their words don't have life it's only the word of a son of god which has life are you hearing me let me tell you when a woman hears a word she is changed we have a linda agnes here i wonder if you can put on your video can you put on your video if you can i don't know whether she's at home what what but if you can put on your video i'll be happy because people will be able to see you hallelujah sister alinda was a you know a young a young maybe she may be waiting to hear what i'm going to say and then she will switch on her video but i know she's being a mother that she she might also be a bit busy with a baby i understand that but here's what i wanted to say uh whether or not she puts on a video i would still give a testimony sister alinda you know was in my house for years and years we even went to theater together for years and years yes i know you were hearing but i wanted the people to see you also and uh and so sister alinda eventually my little brother comes and speaks to her words of love what the what and when he spoke words of love to her is because the world will change change so sister so sister so sister so don't give don't give your ears ears gears to someone who has who has this gift let this be off okay so don't allow someone to give you words which are not coming from the right inspiration so we find that uh this brother here the devil comes to eve who is representing if the devil comes to eve and he gives her also want and she was changed meaning her mindset was changed and when her mind said god changed what happened she was ready to do whatever it is that she was she had to do just like mary mary was also ready but what did she act upon all was to do is to believe but if all was she was to do was to believe plus act plus do something if you love me why can't you do this see if you like my country ah you know those kind of things it is satanic right until you get the right man for you and your marriage now eve accepted her body to be touched yes and then she was able to yield to the desire of the devil and that's how she was able to get a child are you following me that is the difference between evil's story and mary's story both of them were virgins both of them when the word came to them and so i tell you the devil cannot be able to accomplish something in your life without ruining your life but god can accomplish something in your life without ruining it hallelujah you want god to accomplish something in your life you to him just accept believe it it will be done okay can we proceed and we see where to finish because it is almost six and tomorrow we have uh tomorrow we have a crusade we i need to be a ready their bodies okay oh hey me know let me know let me know with your audience okay this okay okay okay okay okay okay i i hope can i have a quad actually is that is actually a revolutionary revolution relational relation literally through c c or c or c or series favorite great and i thought okay is simply the if that's would think that it is not what is not what is not what is not what is not possible well the the prophets the prophets the prophets prophet said lord take the lord the lord with the lord with the lord oh what's up my wrist on my wrist on my wrist my wrist on my wrist but not my right essential characteristic characteristics or characteristics or subjects so that's happening so that's happening don't happen to what's happening that's only spirit speech save it save it save it say which themselves yourselves yourselves yourselves yourselves so and is right to the right takes place that accidents accidents acceptance acceptance accept those cells and puts them in in exactly that right straight place the infinity but but that will incoming mingling england did it take place so of chemical epidemic affinity within which still exists for back in eden that's the center was an upright picture right creature she was he was cute she was human he was he was now that we have come here let's apply to crystal crystalline christianize your thinkings your thinkings your thinkings your thinking so you can so you can see you can see and see see see so you can so you can white now the white most most definitely sitting in it sits for before i found a different foundation there's your foundation patient changed what's to change by jesus christ and himself himself according according to the pleasure of his of his will his will to to the to the tutorial the glory of his glory his glory of his glory of his grace wherein he had made us accept accept accept accept accepted in the love and their beloved beloved in whom we have redemption without his turn through his plan through his blood through his blood the forgivingness of sins his grace his grace his grace his grace and i purpose the it was planned over the planet with the planet with redemption it had planned the plan of the plan of the plan of islam of salaam observance requires salvation in order to give itself freedom and purpose of being that is one hundred percent correct announcements of scripture bear it out as does the very verse of romans 11 6 36 of him and through him and to give all things to whom be glory but before god could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and said man had to fall the whole which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make fall saturn had to come through flesh also but satan would not come through my flesh to make the fall as christ coming human flesh to others but the other animal there's something so close to a man that certainly could get to that peace have you seen that part that saturn could not come in human flesh like jesus did to come and make the fall because it's not god it's only god who can do that but there was an animal something so close to man that certainly could get even as jesus would one day come and get himself to the human race human bodies even to the extent of the resurrection where we would have bodies like and choose that's what would work to the tree of life and i mean certainly not because in time but then anyway animal had caused the fall and it's not let's animalize the shade [Music] when god would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore a fallen man and make him a particular of that life once you see this you can understand the stuff and see i know that it was no apple event no it was a degradation of humanity by international industry all right now i would like us to go to uh you can finish up that last beach the most important we have covered but i would like us to go a little bit down there and see and say and what did that reproduce the tree of knowledge produced death cain killed his brother aber the wicked killed the righteous it set a pattern it will keep that pattern until the restoration of all things are spoken by the prophets so the tree of knowledge produced clever men men of renown but their ways are the ways of death god's people are simple but spiritual minded leading to what god and nature calmly treating the soil caring the the the truth for the truth rather than wealth are you hearing the seed of the serpent has brought tremendous cameras wonderful intentions inventions rather but with it all comes death with it all comes death their gun power the atomic bombs this is the stuff that brought forth all these things and in peace time there are mechanical inventions such as the car they are killed even more in a time of peace than the the other invasions of war destroyed in times of trouble death and destruction are the fruits of halibuts but they are religious they believe in god they they are like their father the devil and their ancestor cain both of them believe in god they go to church they mingle with the righteous as do they tears mingle with the wheat in so doing they corrupt and produce a nicolaitan religion you see where it comes from they spread their poison in every effort to destroy the seed of god even as king killed abel there is no fear of god before their eyes but god loses none of his own i love that he keeps them even in death and has promised that in the last day he will raise them up hallelujah oh my praise the name of the lord amen he promised that in the last day he will raise them up you believe that hallelujah now i would like us to go to our conclusion and we bring this to our close i hope that you are not waiting oh when are we finishing this i just hope you are enjoying all through hallelujah to him that rava cometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god now what a thrilling thought as is this the tree of life is the garden of eden of course you have already seen the tree of life in the garden of eden which could not be approached andrew because of the fall of adam is now given to the over karma you remember i talked about that now we have access to the tree of life the flaming sort of the gardening cherubim has been sheathed uh but it was not stretched before its blade was bloody with the blood of the lamb you know meaning that that's what was out there waiting who it will destroy but now it has been shift it has been put back it has been kept meaning we shall not die or be killed if we access the tree of life we now have free access to the tree of life let us meditate upon this truth a while as we consider why the tree was denied of adam and his descendants but now allowed again and so we can now see that the tree of life which was rejected in the beginning we remember adam and eve was cast out now it is accepted and now it is not that we will die we shall actually leave even for a space of a thousand years a millennium why do you think we can be able to live for a millennium one thousand days when even adam never made it when even methuselah never made it it is because the the sword has been shift has been kept away we now have access amen you know uh that is the most interesting thing why we are believing this message right now what are you doing you are eating the tree of life you are eating until the body becomes so tired but the spirit still eats and one of these days when we are going to our reward others will be like what can i do also so i can also get what you have but there's nothing you can do i've been eating for many years how can you eat for all those years in one day it can't happen so those who have been missing this it is it is going to be they're going to be so sorry they missed it you is receiving it now you will be so happy that you spent your time everything else does not have value the only thing that holds value is christ and his word christ and is what i tell you when you begin to see the the things of the world in the light of the world you are like come to think of it what what really holds value what really is important nothing but christ because whatever it is that you are getting that is spiritual for your spirit for your soul is what you will leave this world with and the way you leave the world is the way you will you remain don't ever think that when you go there because there's another world though together you will now be chained and be a good man no if you are bad here you are bad there if you're good here you're about if you're a politician here you are petitioned there if you're a mother right here you are mother if you're a footballer your footballer there whatever you were yeah here you were there so now don't even think that you will die and you'll become a better man if he was up and said yeah you're supposed to sit there if you're a seed of god here you're a seed of god there if you are stabbed here yourself there if you are changing the year you are changed there if you are reasoning here you are reasoning there if you love god here you
