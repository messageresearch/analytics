[3:57] Hangover are

[4:05] meetings I'm happy to see

[4:17] little bit out of the
[4:21] meetings we have brother Pastor morus
[4:25] from Ethiopia with us
[4:28] today amen and we have brother Prince
[4:32] from Zimbabwe with us
[4:36] today praise the
[4:37] Lord so uh uh the program is this
[4:42] way in a few
[4:45] moments myself and pastoras and his
[4:47] family will be headed to
[4:52] Z where he will be ministering this
[4:56] evening those who missed his ministry
[4:59] and desire to hear him
[5:03] preach just to go and stream the service
[5:05] he preached at the Youth
[5:10] Camp you will be blessed by
[5:13] that but for now I will ask him to come
[5:15] and greet Us in about five
[5:19] minutes so that we can now make way for
[5:22] the
[5:27] Min us
[5:39] God bless you
[5:44] Brethren hallelujah hallelujah always
[5:48] good to be in the house of God and in
[5:51] his
[5:54] presence always to come to this
[5:58] place
[6:01] but God will make it the appoint
[6:07] time from the other side of
[6:11] Ethiopia we've been always heing
[6:16] testimonies God has really been
[6:19] increasing
[6:22] you expanding you and being with
[6:27] you and that is now the sign that God is
[6:37] you fear not little the
[6:44] Bible because God intention is to give
[6:47] us his
[6:49] kingdom so we are so grateful
[6:54] foror you see sometimes it's so
[6:57] difficult you know I've not said this
[6:58] before maybe let me me say it in one
[7:00] minute let me say say it in one
[7:03] minute you know he was with us
[7:07] there you know you would sometimes think
[7:10] that I'm setting in this country and I'm
[7:13] Contin with the ministry and
[7:19] uh establishing Ministry and expanding
[7:26] and setting out up your family members
[7:30] you you decide to live
[7:34] there but now God comes and speaks
[7:39] otherwise speaking it is very difficult
[7:42] toate
[7:46] again has been so hard
[7:50] time remember we were
[7:53] together but if God is in
[7:56] something he always makes a way
[8:00] so it was God's
[8:03] leadership this is the fruit that God is
[8:05] with
[8:08] you and this little children with a
[8:12] mother and all of
[8:15] them I can say we grew together in the
[8:25] [Music]
[8:28] faith those ones we were they were on
[8:31] our
[8:33] hands they were already
[8:37] Ethiopians because we thought they would
[8:40] grow and maybe they would establish a
[8:42] family also
[8:45] that they even started you know adopting
[8:47] the food
[8:50] that even was at
[8:55] school looks like
[8:58] ethopian
[9:00] because she she ate Ethiopian
[9:03] food so that time when those that
[9:06] situation
[9:09] happened all of us we were broken in our
[9:13] hearts I remember Pastor coming and
[9:15] telling me I am going to go back to my
[9:19] Country and this ministry is looking up
[9:22] to
[9:23] you I remember telling
[9:28] him find any other possible
[9:31] way for you to stay
[9:34] here but he kept
[9:37] [Music]
[9:39] saying like I said on the
[9:43] convention our mother
[9:49] Sister Sister re
[9:55] call so she the first person that saw
[9:59] in
[10:03] me so all those
[10:05] times were precious in the sight of
[10:08] God and God connected us for a greater
[10:13] purpose we are from one another right
[10:17] now physically speaking but spiritually
[10:21] speaking we were
[10:22] one we are one
[10:24] family that I say with all my heart we
[10:26] are one
[10:28] family
[10:30] and days ahead of
[10:32] us God Will Make A Way That We Shall
[10:36] Have a joint
[10:39] meetings will make a way for you to come
[10:41] the other
[10:43] side
[10:45] come is just a
[10:48] family if a child gets married to
[10:51] another man away from
[10:53] home you will always find a way to come
[10:58] home so don't worry we are
[11:01] one we are only in the business of the
[11:04] kingdom of
[11:06] God so we are laboring that side you are
[11:11] labing all for the same
[11:14] purpose that is to expand the word of
[11:18] God so we are so
[11:20] grateful with a
[11:23] testimony actually me as personally not
[11:26] as a church or a Ministry now

[29:12] our errors
[29:14] Lord because if you would look at our
[29:16] sins and our errors
[29:18] Lord none would be
[29:20] here for we were all born in in sin and
[29:24] Sh in
[29:26] iniquity but Lord you provided the blood
[29:28] of the
[29:30] lamb for the remission of our
[29:33] sins that's why the singer of a song
[29:35] wrote and
[29:37] S that you looked beyond my fault and
[29:39] saw my
[29:40] need heavenly father now we are gathered
[29:43] into thy
[29:44] presence we are gathered as children
[29:47] Jehovah On th table to Feast of Thy word
[29:51] Jehovah for we believe in the preaching
[29:53] of the
[29:54] Gospel that casts out devils
[29:58] that sets the Bound free that raises the
[30:02] dead that heal the sick oh Heavenly
[30:05] Father what a privilege it is to be in
[30:08] your presence this evening Lord we are
[30:11] not
[30:12] worthy but you loved us anyhow Lord hide
[30:16] me behind the
[30:17] cross that I may never be
[30:20] seen but that you minister to your
[30:23] children because you will not bless my
[30:25] words and nothing that I can say that
[30:28] can change their lives but you are the
[30:31] father of spirits the bishop of
[30:32] souls you alone can minister to their
[30:35] hearts Lord I'm not from around here I
[30:39] don't know the problems that they going
[30:41] through but the Great Eagle is in the
[30:44] camp the one who sees the intense and
[30:46] desires of the hearts Lord Minister
[30:49] yourself to their hearts we thank you
[30:52] tonight Lord for the preaching of the
[30:55] word we thank you Heavenly Father
[30:58] for the sacrifices that have been made
[31:00] for every soul that is here Lord as they
[31:03] are under great
[31:04] expectation we no expectation is the
[31:06] breeding ground for the
[31:09] miraculous give unto each and everyone
[31:11] the desires of their hearts in the
[31:13] mighty name of the Lord Jesus
[31:15] Christ amen and
[31:17] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[31:21] praise God how many are happy to be in
[31:24] the house of the
[31:25] Lord how many are happy to be
[31:28] here
[31:30] hallelujah my brother my
[31:32] sister if you really
[31:35] knew who you were who you are in the
[31:40] eyes of God not in the eyes of the
[31:42] person sitting next to you because each
[31:45] and every person has got an idea that
[31:48] they have about another person's life
[31:52] but if you knew what God
[31:55] sees when looks at you you would give a
[31:59] better amen if you knew who you really
[32:02] were you would not be bound by chains of
[32:05] circumstances you would not be bound by
[32:07] chains of
[32:08] tiredness you wouldn't be bound by
[32:11] chains of
[32:13] things things that are bothering you but
[32:16] you would give God a better am because
[32:19] we have seen him as Jehovah Gyra we have
[32:23] seen him as Jehovah
[32:25] Rafa wait tonight
[32:28] you are going to see him as
[32:29] Jehovah God Great and Mighty in battle
[32:33] because when he revealed himself as
[32:35] Jehovah Mighty in battle on the children
[32:38] of Israel they sang a new song and M who
[32:43] was caught by the chains of
[32:47] circumstances she took a
[32:49] tambourine and she danced in a way that
[32:53] she had never
[32:54] danced so today when you see God
[32:57] as a mighty deliverer delivering you
[33:00] from your situation you will give a
[33:03] better amen hallelujah praise God how
[33:06] many are happy to be in the house of the
[33:08] Lord if you happy give me a better amen
[33:12] let the redeemed shout hallelujah let
[33:14] the redeemed say so because when you
[33:17] know who God has made you to be that
[33:21] Devils there is not enough devils in
[33:24] hell that can stand before you
[33:27] because you are a
[33:28] superpower because you know who God has
[33:30] called you to be hallelujah praise God
[33:34] You Cee to look at
[33:36] yourself just a little sister you SE to
[33:39] look at yourself just a little brother
[33:42] but you look at yourself as the true
[33:46] embodiment of who God really is
[33:49] hallelujah praise God praise God
[33:52] hallelujah can I have a better
[33:55] amen let the briide of Christ shout
[33:58] hallelujah oh praise God Amen it reminds
[34:02] me in the Book of Joshua when God wanted
[34:06] to deliver the children of
[34:08] Israel he could have told them go with
[34:10] your swords and
[34:12] fight you
[34:14] better sword do not win
[34:17] battles my brother swords of words do
[34:19] not win
[34:20] battles my brother swords of Deceit and
[34:24] deception they do not win battles but
[34:27] there is a better weapon that God G to
[34:30] Joshua and the children of Israel that
[34:32] if they would use that weapon the of
[34:35] Jero would fall this is the weapon that
[34:39] I'm asking you to use tonight when I'm
[34:41] saying let the redeemed say hallelujah
[34:44] that's the weapon of Praise that God
[34:47] told the children of Israel you will
[34:49] March around the city and on the seventh
[34:52] day after you have marched for the
[34:54] seventh time give a shout of praise and
[34:57] the of Jero will fall I tell you tonight
[35:01] if you give God a shot of praise the of
[35:04] Jero in your life they are going to fall
[35:07] hallelujah praise God if you believe it
[35:10] can you give me
[35:11] am hallelujah hallelujah oh praise God
[35:16] amen amen I would like to thank the
[35:20] pastor In
[35:22] Absentia you know it's a really hard
[35:24] thing for a pastor to leave you his pit
[35:26] and when is not
[35:29] around it really means that he really
[35:31] trusts
[35:32] you it really means that he knows that
[35:35] his flock is in safe
[35:38] hands I want to tell you this is my
[35:42] first
[35:43] time standing on the pulpit in
[35:46] church we are used to preaching out
[35:48] there in the
[35:50] streets in the far away
[35:52] places you know how there you can afford
[35:54] to make a mistake
[35:57] because the people out there do not
[35:59] really
[36:00] know what is entailed in this
[36:03] message but here it's a really hard
[36:07] thing to preach to a person who knows
[36:11] Malachi 4 because any simple mistake
[36:14] that you
[36:15] made they are there and they watching
[36:17] you they'll tell you ah brother I think
[36:20] you
[36:22] missed so there's none there's no harder
[36:25] thing
[36:27] than to preach to a
[36:28] Believer but I'm glad that today the
[36:31] Lord will make a
[36:32] way and I respect Pastor
[36:35] T along with my pastor from
[36:39] gu Pastor who trusted me to come
[36:42] here hallelujah praise God I want to
[36:46] tell you of a little story before we get
[36:47] into the
[36:49] word there was a man who stayed in the
[36:53] city he had a lot of money perhaps he
[36:57] was a
[36:58] billionaire so he was used to listening
[37:01] to the to the
[37:03] television and watching the news on the
[37:06] television on France 24 maybe
[37:08] France BBC
[37:11] world but then one day he had to travel
[37:13] to the rural
[37:14] areas but the problem now was that in
[37:17] the rural
[37:18] areas there was no satellite dishes
[37:21] there there was no
[37:23] bbcc there was no France 24
[37:27] 24 there was no CBS News CBS News there
[37:31] wasn't any of
[37:32] that but there was a small
[37:35] radio a very very small radio so one day
[37:38] he was sitting there and an announcement
[37:41] was made on the small
[37:43] radio that please
[37:45] indeed do not drink water from the T for
[37:49] the next one
[37:51] week because there's something there's
[37:53] some poison that is in those
[37:55] TS
[37:57] if you drink you will surely
[38:00] die but now because the men were so
[38:03] used to watching news on on
[38:06] BBC he said what can this small radio
[38:08] tell
[38:10] me a man like
[38:12] me I cannot listen to a small radio like
[38:15] this because it has got nothing to tell
[38:18] me my brother I want to tell you that
[38:21] man drank the water from the T and he
[38:24] surely died what is the moral of the
[38:27] story it's not about the device that is
[38:30] giving you the
[38:31] message it's is not about the preacher
[38:33] standing in the
[38:34] P might be a small radio and you are so
[38:38] used to hearing from BBC News and great
[38:42] and great
[38:43] preachers who push their belly
[38:45] around and I'm just a young man like
[38:48] me but I tell you if you look at the
[38:52] size of the radio and miss the message
[38:55] coming from the radio you will surely
[38:57] die it reminds me of the Lord Jesus
[39:00] Christ the Bible says in the book of
[39:02] Isaiah there was nothing in him that
[39:06] when we would see him we would desire
[39:08] him they were so used to their high
[39:11] priest who had beard that was sweeping
[39:14] the
[39:15] streets you know big
[39:17] shoulders very tall and very dark
[39:20] skinned that when they would speak speak
[39:24] terites would fall but the Lord Jesus
[39:26] Christ came in away like a small radio
[39:30] until even
[39:31] Nathaniel sitting under a tree said what
[39:35] good can come out of
[39:36] nazare but I want to thank God there was
[39:38] a Philip who said I know nael what you
[39:42] think but I won't say something to you
[39:45] the only thing that I'll say to you is
[39:47] come and see my brother just come and
[39:50] see but the Lord is good it is not about
[39:53] the
[39:54] preacher it is about the message that is
[39:57] coming hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[40:01] hallelujah so do not look down on me I
[40:04] might be just a young man but I tell you
[40:08] I know where I've been and I tell you I
[40:10] know who I'm
[40:12] representing when I am standing here I
[40:15] am not afraid of demons I am not going
[40:17] to be afraid of witches because I know
[40:20] who I'm standing for that great mighty
[40:23] king
[40:24] Jehovah Hallelujah so if you're unexpect

[49:53] Jesus
[49:54] Christ we pray
[49:58] amen hallelujah hallelujah we may now
[50:01] take our
[50:03] seats and I'm going to read again from
[50:05] The Book of Revelations CH
[50:09] 4:7 it says
[50:11] here and the first Beast was like a lion
[50:16] and the second beast was like a cal and
[50:18] the third Beast had a face as a man and
[50:21] the fourth Beast was like a flying
[50:24] eagle
[50:41] hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen
[50:44] are you still happy to be in the house
[50:45] of the Lord we have read in the Book of
[50:49] Genesis the Book of Genesis chapter
[50:51] 1 where God says let us make man in our
[50:55] own image after our own after own
[50:59] likeness and I'll ask you a question
[51:02] what is the image of God is it big eyes
[51:05] and big
[51:06] ears is it he very tall or very
[51:10] darkin but the prophet tells us God that
[51:13] God is
[51:14] spirit and God does not have a
[51:17] St because he is a spirit but the image
[51:21] of
[51:21] God was the authority of God that's why
[51:26] he says now and we will give him
[51:29] dominion over all the things upon the
[51:32] face of the Earth which was the image of
[51:35] God that was the likeness of
[51:38] God that God R the
[51:40] heavens and men would rule upon the face
[51:43] of the
[51:43] earth that is the reason why God created
[51:46] men for him to have
[51:49] dominion then I have a question for you
[51:52] I begin to wonder that if God created
[51:55] you to have
[51:57] dominion how come you fail to assume
[52:00] dominion over the smallest of things
[52:04] over even in your classroom at
[52:07] school you do not want to assume a
[52:09] position of
[52:10] power they ask you to be a class monitor
[52:12] you refuse even it's your job when they
[52:16] want you to be uh in charge of a number
[52:19] of
[52:20] people you refuse my question is what
[52:23] manner of men are you from once did you
[52:27] come because a man that was created in
[52:29] the image of God was created to assume
[52:33] power and to take
[52:35] dominion over all the things of the
[52:37] earth when I mean all things I don't
[52:40] mean something I mean all things that
[52:44] means even your financial
[52:46] problems it falls under all things that
[52:49] means the sickness in your body it falls
[52:52] under all things that means a
[52:54] problematic
[52:58] work that means your empty pant
[53:02] home old things you were created and
[53:06] made in the image of God to have
[53:09] dominion and excise
[53:12] authority over all things now in the
[53:15] Book of Genesis chapter 2 we hear that
[53:18] God now created this man and formed Out
[53:21] of the Dust of the earth a body
[53:25] and put the spirit man that he had
[53:27] created in that body and he called them
[53:31] Adam now Adam standing in the image of
[53:34] God on the
[53:36] earth he was a miniature
[53:39] God the prophet tells
[53:41] us that Adam was an
[53:44] extension he was a part of God Adam was
[53:48] a God on the earth that's why Adam would
[53:50] stand and say River flow from the south
[53:53] to the north yes River the water river
[53:58] flow from the south to the North and the
[54:01] rivers would obey because he was
[54:03] standing in the
[54:05] authority that God created to stand
[54:08] that's why Adam would wake up on one
[54:11] day say C the clouds and say
[54:13] clouds come and cover and give us a
[54:16] little bit of
[54:17] shade and a wind from the East must blow
[54:21] in the garden and surely and indeed sure
[54:25] his light is different from the
[54:27] day the wind would
[54:30] come why because Adam was standing in
[54:34] the
[54:35] authority that God had
[54:37] created that was the first
[54:41] specimen God had created he was standing
[54:44] in his position hallelujah praise God
[54:48] but we realize and we know that after
[54:52] some time God took out a rib from Adam
[54:56] and Adam called that woman Eve you see
[54:59] it was in the nature of Adam to even
[55:02] give names to things God would come down
[55:05] one day with an answer
[55:08] sheet hiding it behind his back and God
[55:12] would bring a
[55:13] lion just to see what Adam would
[55:16] call Adam because he was God he was
[55:19] standing in the image of God he was an
[55:22] extension of who God
[55:24] was look at the lion say because when
[55:27] you
[55:28] roll terites from trees fall yes terites
[55:32] from trees
[55:34] [Music]
[55:36] fall because you have a big
[55:42] man because you have a big man you
[55:44] called a lion and God will check his
[55:46] answer sheet and God that would be the
[55:49] name of and God would say amen and God
[55:53] would bring an elephant an elephant
[55:55] would come and God would look at his
[55:59] just to see what Moses would call what
[56:00] what Adam would call and Adam would
[56:03] stand and say because you have big
[56:09] ears gray
[56:11] skin I'm going to call you
[56:13] elephant and God would say Amen because
[56:17] Adam was standing in the image that God
[56:20] created to he was standing in the image
[56:23] of God after the likeness of the
[56:26] Creator he himself could stand and say
[56:29] something God would be his
[56:31] amen somebody say amen hallelujah if you
[56:35] believe it say
[56:36] Amen but after a while the serpent came
[56:40] into the garden
[56:42] of and beged Eve and Adam because he
[56:47] knew that God was going to
[56:49] kill out of the love that he had Adam
[56:53] was not deceived Adam knew exactly what
[56:56] he was doing the prophet tells us that
[56:59] ifam hadn't partaken of the sin that Eve
[57:01] had
[57:02] done was going to die but Adam knew that
[57:06] Eve was an extension
[57:08] of so he in the sin to save his wife now
[57:13] because Adam had
[57:15] done God could not kill Adam because
[57:18] Adam was an extension of
[57:20] who God would have killed Adam God would
[57:24] have killed a part of
[57:26] could not kill hallelujah praise God so
[57:30] when you are sit there you have got to
[57:33] know that you an
[57:35] extension of who God was now the prophet
[57:38] tells us the reason why Adam could stand
[57:42] and say all those things and God will
[57:45] say Amen because Adam a titled did
[57:49] book Adam was given a book of
[57:52] authority Adam was given a secret to the
[57:54] the
[57:55] access of the authority of
[57:58] God after Adam fell he fitted the rights
[58:02] of the
[58:03] book and the devil because he had dirty
[58:07] hands could not get his hand on the book
[58:10] the book had only one thing left to do
[58:13] was to return return to his
[58:14] original who was the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:17] who had given it to Adam in the then we
[58:20] see Adam being chased from the and the
[58:23] lion that Adam would one day walk
[58:25] with a dog putting it on the
[58:28] leash started to hunt him why because he
[58:33] had
[58:34] lostt did book he had lost the right but
[58:38] I want to thank God that even though God
[58:42] had already made a way to bring men back
[58:46] to his former estate that's why the
[58:49] prophet preach the message the
[58:51] restoration of the bright tree now he
[58:55] explains to us what restoration means
[58:59] restoration means to put back
[59:03] where not to take something new but that
[59:06] very thing that was lost and restore it
[59:09] back to its original
[59:11] position hallelujah praise God now came
[59:14] Jesus Christ the second Adam upon the
[59:18] face of the Earth who are
[59:21] standing in the volume of the book
[59:24] that's why Christ one day when the winds
[59:27] and the storms would
[59:29] rise Christ sleeping in the boat he
[59:32] would stand and put his foot on the
[59:34] bridge of the ship and peace be still
[59:37] and the Seas and the winds would obey
[59:40] and the disciples would ask what manner
[59:43] of a man is I tell you the manner of a
[59:47] man it was the second Adam that was upon
[59:50] the face of the Earth it was God's plan
[59:55] men back to his rightful position
[59:58] hallelujah praise God hallelujah
[1:00:01] hallelujah hallelujah praise God
[1:00:03] hallelujah if you are grateful for the
[1:00:04] second
[1:00:06] Adam will give God a better
[1:00:08] amen now standing on the face of the
[1:00:11] Earth as a second would stand and look
[1:00:15] at
[1:00:20] and little girl rise he would look at
[1:00:24] J's daughter
[1:00:27] and say girl
[1:00:28] rise and immediately she would
[1:00:31] rise he was standing in the volume of
[1:00:33] the book he was standing in the image of
[1:00:36] God and he would say things and God
[1:00:39] would say amen I want to tell you
[1:00:42] tonight if you tonight have been put in
[1:00:45] the body of Christ the Bible says by one
[1:00:48] Spirit we are baptized into one body
[1:00:52] which is the body of Christ now if if
[1:00:54] you are there you are standing as a as a
[1:00:58] part of Adam you are an eve in this last
[1:01:02] day and you have the same Authority
[1:01:06] because the husband and the
[1:01:08] wife one flesh you and Christ are one
[1:01:12] flesh you can also stand and your dead
[1:01:16] situation in your dead
[1:01:18] situation you can also stand to a
[1:01:22] situation in your life and God will say
[1:01:25] Amen why because you have been
[1:01:29] restored praise God Amen now we read in
[1:01:33] the Book of
[1:01:34] Revelation chapter 4 or chapter 5 you
[1:01:38] hear that after all had been said and
[1:01:41] Down In
[1:01:42] Heaven There was a
[1:01:44] meeting God and His angels and all the
[1:01:47] saints in everyone else they were
[1:01:49] sitting there there
[1:01:50] was and there was one that was seated
[1:01:53] upon the throne who had a book remember
[1:01:56] in the Book of Genesis there was once a
[1:01:59] book but the book returned to it
[1:02:01] original
[1:02:02] own now in the Book of Revelations we
[1:02:05] see that
[1:02:06] original sitting upon the throne with a
[1:02:09] book in his hand that was
[1:02:12] closed the book had been
[1:02:15] closed when Adam in the book of of
[1:02:19] Eden open book that why that is why he
[1:02:23] could exercise
[1:02:25] the authority of what was in the book
[1:02:27] but after he lost it the book then was
[1:02:29] closed it return back to the owner now
[1:02:33] the owner was sitting on the throne with
[1:02:35] a closed book in his head and the
[1:02:37] question was asked who is worthy to come
[1:02:41] and take the book to look at the book
[1:02:45] and to lose the and the Bible says there
[1:02:48] was none found in heav there was none
[1:02:51] found there was none found who could
[1:02:54] take the book to look at it and to
[1:02:59] lose and to lose the SE and John said I
[1:03:04] weped
[1:03:05] much why did John weep because he knew
[1:03:09] that if the book
[1:03:11] Remain the devil would have authority of
[1:03:14] God's children and all of creation would
[1:03:17] be lost hallelujah hallelujah but praise
[1:03:21] God John says in there I beh is the
[1:03:24] voice that say we not
[1:03:27] joh not I'm saying to you
[1:03:31] tonight not let FL not give for there is
[1:03:36] one that has been found worthy to take
[1:03:39] the book The and said
[1:03:44] Lord I saw a
[1:03:46] lion the voice said the lion of the
[1:03:49] tribe of Jud has been found worthy but
[1:03:52] when he beheld he says I saw a
[1:03:55] l was slain from the foundations of the
[1:03:59] world walking in the presence of God and
[1:04:03] he took the
[1:04:04] book and when he took the book that's
[1:04:07] when we realize now in the Book of
[1:04:10] Revelations that now there was a mighty
[1:04:13] Angel who is this Mighty Angel the Bible
[1:04:17] says he had clown and a
[1:04:19] rainbow the prophet explains what a
[1:04:21] rainbow means it says a rainbow
[1:04:23] represent
[1:04:25] a covenant saw the angel with the
[1:04:28] Covenant the Tells that isone other than
[1:04:31] the Lord Jesus Christ he is the Angel of
[1:04:33] the coven now when that Mighty angel
[1:04:37] came down from heaven the book was no
[1:04:40] longer CL it says he had in his right
[1:04:43] hand an open book when you get to verse
[1:04:47] five verse you hear that there was
[1:04:51] another Mighty
[1:04:52] Angel standing upon the face of the
[1:04:55] Earth my brother there had to be another
[1:04:58] Mighty Angel standing upon the face of
[1:05:01] the Earth who is this Mighty angel now
[1:05:04] we in the Book of Revelation 1 that God
[1:05:07] is Seven Stars in
[1:05:09] his Seven Stars at the seven Messengers
[1:05:12] all the seven angels to to the seven
[1:05:15] Church Angels that's why John was told
[1:05:19] to the angel of the first church write
[1:05:22] these things to the angel of the second
[1:05:26] now in the 10th chapter there was an
[1:05:29] angel standing upon the face of the
[1:05:31] Earth hallelujah praise God who had his
[1:05:35] foot one upon the
[1:05:37] sea one upon the land and his hand was
[1:05:41] lifted up in the heavens one foot on the
[1:05:44] sea he was putting all powers that we
[1:05:48] Under the Sea Under his feet and his
[1:05:52] right foot on the land he rejecting all
[1:05:54] power under his feet remember in the
[1:05:57] Book of Genesis God created man that he
[1:06:01] should
[1:06:02] excise and
[1:06:04] Authority all things now this Mighty
[1:06:09] Angel Prophet William the seventh angel
[1:06:13] of this
[1:06:14] seventh was standing there and he was
[1:06:17] putting all pow under his foot that's
[1:06:21] why in the prayer
[1:06:22] L he would stand say I every spirit and
[1:06:27] put it under my feet for the glory of
[1:06:29] the Lord Jesus Christ and one hand was
[1:06:32] lifted up in heaven the Bible tells us
[1:06:35] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:06:37] but against principalities and and
[1:06:40] spiritual
[1:06:41] wickedness in Heavenly places so why was
[1:06:45] his hand lifted up he was taking a hold
[1:06:48] of spiritual wickedness in Heavenly
[1:06:52] places and he was putting them
[1:06:54] under subjection because why he was
[1:06:58] standing in the image that God created
[1:07:02] to stand hallelujah hallelujah praise
[1:07:05] God hallelujah hallelujah if you
[1:07:09] happy say Amen if you believe this to be
[1:07:12] the truth will you shout amen oh give
[1:07:16] God a clip
[1:07:17] of Hallelujah praise God and now the
[1:07:20] prophet tells us that John
[1:07:24] represented the bride and John was told
[1:07:28] go to the angel that is upon the face of
[1:07:31] the Earth and take the book that open
[1:07:36] book remember the message of
[1:07:39] restoration was now restoring back the
[1:07:42] man that had
[1:07:44] fallen from his original
[1:07:46] state back into his
[1:07:48] position now John the
[1:07:51] bride was told go and take the book and
[1:07:56] eat of the book or study the book
[1:07:59] meditate upon the book write it upon the
[1:08:02] tables of heart and after you do that it
[1:08:06] shall be sweet in th mouth and bitter in
[1:08:09] th and after you do that prophesy again
[1:08:13] hallelujah praise God let me tell you
[1:08:16] tonight this book is not given this book
[1:08:19] is taken the Bible says from the time of
[1:08:23] John the Baptist
[1:08:24] until now the Kingdom of Heaven suff
[1:08:28] violence and the violence shall take it
[1:08:33] that is why I have a problem with
[1:08:36] Christians want everything to be handed
[1:08:39] down to be handed down to them it was
[1:08:42] never in the plan of God to just you
[1:08:45] things you are supposed to go and take
[1:08:50] it violently that is why when the devil
[1:08:55] has taken hold of your children you
[1:08:57] don't just sit there and are the devil
[1:09:00] to my
[1:09:00] children to go and take them back and
[1:09:04] say Satan give me back my children and
[1:09:08] say Satan give me back my you taking
[1:09:11] what is
[1:09:12] mine for so long but enough is enough I
[1:09:17] want a Believer to say enough is
[1:09:20] enough taken so much but today I'm
[1:09:24] claiming back everything that you have
[1:09:26] taken from me you have stolen my
[1:09:28] Prosperity you have stolen my peace you
[1:09:32] have stolen my sleep I'm claiming them
[1:09:35] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ as
[1:09:37] John was told go and take the book go
[1:09:41] and take the book when he went there he
[1:09:44] said to the angel give me the book he
[1:09:47] wanted the book to be the angel knew
[1:09:50] better the angel no no no
[1:09:54] I'm not supposed to give you the book
[1:09:56] you are supposed to take it back
[1:09:59] hallelujah praise God that's why tonight
[1:10:02] we are stepping into the of the enemy
[1:10:04] and back every Redemptive
[1:10:08] bless that God is given us because it's
[1:10:11] our right to exercise
[1:10:14] Authority because it is our
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:18] take after John went he took the book
[1:10:23] and after he taken the
[1:10:25] he ate of the book and he was

[1:10:58] got some After Effects the side effects
[1:11:01] of this book is to make you prophesy the
[1:11:04] reason why you not prophesying is you

[1:11:38] know hallel praise God I am just laying
[1:11:41] a
[1:11:42] background that you get to know who you
[1:11:46] really are that you must know what is
[1:11:49] rightfully yours that you must know that
[1:11:52] there are no devils in hell that can
[1:11:55] stand before you why because you are
[1:11:58] standing in the volume of the
[1:12:01] book hallelujah hallelujah praise
[1:12:04] God now we were told in the same Book of
[1:12:08] Revelation that there were four
[1:12:12] beasts when the seals were being
[1:12:14] opened there were four four
[1:12:17] Riders there was a black hor white hor
[1:12:20] Rider and the prophet tells us in the
[1:12:23] first seal that the first host Rider
[1:12:27] presented
[1:12:28] deception it was the spirit of the
[1:12:31] Antichrist that it come to deceive
[1:12:34] Hallelujah but when we read in the book
[1:12:37] of Isaiah the book of
[1:12:40] Isaiah hallelujah praise God CH
[1:12:44] 59 from verse it will tell you that when
[1:12:48] the enemy shall come in like a flag the
[1:12:51] spirit of the Lord shall raise a stand
[1:12:55] now in the first
[1:12:56] SE the devil came with the standard of a
[1:12:59] white horse
[1:13:00] rer but hallelujah praise God there was
[1:13:04] an anointing that was upon the face of
[1:13:07] the Earth as we have read in the Book of
[1:13:10] Revelation 4 from verse 7 that there was
[1:13:14] a beast a living creature a lion
[1:13:19] Hallelujah and in those seven Church
[1:13:21] ages and in the Seven Seals
[1:13:24] the prophet explains to us and tells us
[1:13:26] what that anointing meant the anointing
[1:13:29] of the word because it is only the word
[1:13:32] that can expose the devil that is why
[1:13:35] the devil is afraid of the word because
[1:13:38] he knows that that word is going to
[1:13:41] expose him he knows that his destination
[1:13:46] has been made
[1:13:47] known in that very that is why it tries
[1:13:52] as hard as possible to fight the word
[1:13:55] that is why all the mystery of God been
[1:13:58] L Through the Ages why that because the
[1:14:03] devil did not want to be
[1:14:04] exposed but I tell you tonight the more
[1:14:07] you eat of this book The more you put
[1:14:09] yourself together with this book that
[1:14:11] whatever devil in your life is bothering
[1:14:14] you going to be exposed I don't care if
[1:14:19] it's the spirit of where you come from
[1:14:23] okay if it's the spirit of your uncles
[1:14:26] who nothing and that's the reason maybe
[1:14:29] you cannot get a job because your uncle
[1:14:32] with devil is about
[1:14:35] to the devil is in trouble the devil is
[1:14:38] in trouble I say the devil is in trouble
[1:14:41] he's about to be exposed glory to
[1:14:44] God hallelujah hallelujah when the
[1:14:48] enemy shall come in like a flag the
[1:14:51] spirit of the Lord shall
[1:14:54] against him now we are told in the
[1:14:58] following three Church
[1:14:59] ages there was a dominating
[1:15:02] Spirit which was the red hor
[1:15:06] riter now the red rer the red rer the
[1:15:11] prophet explains that he
[1:15:14] represented death so many saints were
[1:15:17] going to be but Jesus Christ said in the
[1:15:19] Book of John I will not leave you I
[1:15:23] forsake you but I will be with you even
[1:15:26] in you until the end of the world now
[1:15:29] Christ the same was in the
[1:15:33] beginning that we see in the book of
[1:15:36] Isaiah being prophesied of the same one
[1:15:39] we see as a mighty angel coming down
[1:15:44] with an open book was in the church age
[1:15:47] and there was an anointing God raised
[1:15:49] the standard the devil came as the
[1:15:52] standard of
[1:15:54] as as the storm of a red horse
[1:15:56] rider but God rais the standard and the
[1:16:00] prophet tells us that God does not take
[1:16:02] a
[1:16:03] ruler and come with a ruler and come
[1:16:06] with a
[1:16:07] ruler and put it here and say I'm now

[1:16:12] standard take and put it
[1:16:14] [Music]

[1:17:35] Rider who came what did that black
[1:17:40] represent he represented
[1:17:44] feine spiritual
[1:17:46] fine in those Church
[1:17:48] ages there was no preaching of the true
[1:17:52] words
[1:17:53] and there was the preaching of Father
[1:17:54] Son and the Holy
[1:17:56] Ghost there was preaching of the there
[1:17:59] was the the nikan
[1:18:00] spirit that had become now the

[1:18:05] prevalent that was now about to sit on
[1:18:07] the
[1:18:09] throne and the the black H
[1:18:12] Rider he came the prophet explains and
[1:18:16] says I want you to see this it is not a
[1:18:19] different
[1:18:20] writer it's the same writer
[1:18:23] that is writing on a
[1:18:25] different represents a
[1:18:27] power that's why he told us that in the
[1:18:30] book there of hos it was not different
[1:18:34] creatures it was the same creature that
[1:18:38] was showing itself in four different
[1:18:41] forms the can
[1:18:44] thec but it was the same creature in the
[1:18:47] Book of Revelations there it was the
[1:18:50] same writer the Antichrist
[1:18:53] that was writing
[1:18:55] another but praise God in that day God
[1:19:00] raised man standard heed like
[1:19:04] Lu
[1:19:05] like the intellect that could could
[1:19:10] write the
[1:19:13] ordinances against the Roman Catholic
[1:19:16] church and preach just shall live by fa
[1:19:20] what was that that was the anointing
[1:19:23] anointing of their day Hallelujah that

[1:19:47] powerful
[1:19:48] enemy was the four the fourth seal it
[1:19:52] tells us of an enemy that was a p
[1:19:55] Rider the prophet explains it says a p
[1:20:00] Rider is a mixture of all this
[1:20:05] col now if you know the prophet one time
[1:20:09] when he was casting out Devils he says
[1:20:11] there was one demon that was calling to
[1:20:14] the other demon for
[1:20:15] reinforcement the nature of the devil
[1:20:19] when the devil sees that he being beaten
[1:20:21] on he go caes other demons and say come
[1:20:25] and help me come and help me that is why
[1:20:28] you see your enemy he does not come to
[1:20:30] you one like one this they will come as
[1:20:34] many when the enemy wants to come after
[1:20:36] you your father will rise against you at
[1:20:39] the same time your wife is rising
[1:20:41] against you at the same time at your job
[1:20:43] your boss is rising against you that's
[1:20:45] the plan of the devil that's what he
[1:20:47] does when he sees he's being defeated he
[1:20:51] goes and calls for
[1:20:53] another another power to come and
[1:20:56] support him but praise God the Bible
[1:21:00] says no
