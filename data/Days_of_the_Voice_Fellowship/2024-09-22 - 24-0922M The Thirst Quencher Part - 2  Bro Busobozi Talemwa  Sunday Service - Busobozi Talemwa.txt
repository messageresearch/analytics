go to the word afterwards um I see many are not here this morning but I know over a few uh like um a brother Brian who traveled to a beam he sent his greetings to the church there is a contract he got there he be there for a few days and also we should remember brother Roland he away in the East is they lost their grandmother I think so they he needs us to remember him he tried to be here but he couldn't make it and uh also sister Ruth um on Sunday last Sunday she she was something you know U spoke to me Saturday last last week I wouldn't say something I would say the Holy Spirit and uh so like unus I felt uneasy I don't not know what was going to happen I started to go in fasting and prayer I felt something was a little off last last weekend that would do the devil had certain things he had planned on and so um and then that morning when brother Enoch here was coming with his father on on the motorcycle they had an accident and uh but you see God protected them and no bone was broken amen I believe it was because of prayer and right here uh sister Ruth had come with her children and uh she she on the stairs outside there she she had a misstep and you know she she's expecting and also had a child she was caring and if she had fallen the which was going to fall it would have been very big catastrophe uh but God was gracious and there happened to be the two deacons back there they had to be around and they tried to hold her one was holding the baby was holding and and so the leg her leg got an feet got an injury and um so uh she's under medication currently so we pray for her quick recovery amen so God was gracious if he would if it wasn't for the prayers the devil was planning was but the devil is always on the losing side amen and um so sister m is also in ginger with her family you know she's doing the final goodbyes to her family the remain of the time I know that you'll be streaming afterwards amen and also before I forget receive greetings from Sister Dina uh Boston she's really part of this assembly she streams every service Pray when you are praying sings When you are singing listens to the word receives it you know she contributes to the land fund and pay that so she's really a part of this CH and so we uh she sent she asked me last week to send you greetings and I forgot so I told her this Sunday I'll remember amen this place looks beautiful can we put our hands together for Sister Rose who flowers God bless she said God blessed her with something and so she it was an answered prayer she wanted to give I think it's a good to emulate when God blesses you you give back to him amen praise the Lord since several people are not here deacons if you could help me and fill these chairs right here from this side maybe the could help the deacons amen and uh uh also there is um one thing I wanted to announce today uh uh I'm going to surprise my wife uh today is her birthdayall I'm sure she thought I had forgotten we did not talk about it but I want to say sweetheart happy birthday yeah she's really been a real wife and a real mother to our children and she's been also a support in the ministry and for I do not regret the past 11 years we've been together and it's just a few months to make 12 uh marriage is good amen those of you who have not got to eat you should clap your hands because I'm already in the land and I'm telling you the land is good and when you arri there you will know that I amen praise God the deacons have not done a good job yet I trust that you will do a better job amen while we are also standing if you could stand on our um I preached on this before um brother Tim preached on this several times if it was possible I would have brought him here to preach this um but um just praying he took most of the notes from the message thirsting for life and I trust that you are thirsting today and believing that the Lord will minister to you let us go to the Book of Psalms thank you musicians God bless you chapter 42 our visitors we are so happy and um I almost forgot there's um a brother here right you can raise up your hand by the Judah not Peter this uh brother we he was here on Wednesday I was talking about those days when we did not even have what clothes to wear and I did not notice he was here so he's a witness to what I was saying I I met him I think about 15 or 16 years I don't know long time and uh he's um and then we met again in Nairobi when he was studying theology so he's um he's a preacher of the Gospel from uh the one of I think is it the Full Gospel Church which church is it Pentecostal church we are so happy to have you today thank you for com you and they trust that we shall have more Fellowship we are reading from verses 1 to two if you there Say Amen as the heart pth after the water Brook so pth my soul after thee Oh God my soul thirth for God for the Living God When shall I come and appear before God amen shall we also read Isaiah 55 verses 1 to 3 oh everyone that thirth come to the waters and he that has no money Come Ye buy and eat yeah come buy wine and make milk sorry buy wine and milk without money and without price and we read um the second vers as well wherefor do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfieth not hecken diligently unto me and eat ye that that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fatness incline your ear and come unto me here and your soul shall leave and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mes of David Amen Let us first talk to the Lord Lord Jesus we reverence your presence here this morning and father as we are going now to turn into your word may you be the chief guest this morning put words in my mouth take control of our minds and may we UT those things such as you want us to speak and may may it affect us in such a way that you have desired Grant it that each individ will have a portion and each person will drink from this water that you give freely in Jesus name we pray amen I'm going to speak on uh the first question this is the second part uh really I just want us to have a conversation not so much of a preaching David was longing and wanting the new birth that new [Music] birth here where we read in the Book of Psalms 42 he said I am thirsty for the Living God and I want to say like I spoke in the first part each of us have a thirst and that thirst was placed within us by God and then we begin to thirst for things that do not satisfy but you will never satisfy the thirsting heart with a dead God you know we can preach dress and cod and rules of the church the do and the don't that can never satisfy the which is in your heart the only thing that will will satisfy the thir in your heart he's a living God that is why we as a church must not offer a bunch of geds and and rules regulations you know ideas Creeds but we must offer a living God that's why we must always preach and believe in a living God a God that changes lives a God that saves you from sin a God that delivers you when you are sick a God that can change you and turn your appetite and make you you know walk away from your addictions in Zechariah 13:1 he says in that day there shall be a fountain open to the house of David for sin and for unclean David spoke of the waters in the message tting for for life I read a lot out of that and then again David being a man who dealt into the woods he learned a lot about wild life and in one of the Psalms he cried as we read As the deer thirst for the waters broke so my soul thirth after thee Oh God so in the wilderness places in Israel they had wolves and dogs and these used to attack the deers because these deers were an easy pray for them and you as aie you were that dear chest by the HS of hell you know they swore the devil swore to destroy you you were running we've been running for a long time many of you are still running even now but you see you're running when you run you just run into a deep trap and you find someone trapped by addictions by you know Habits by sin and they trapped you know you they run sometimes they run to total exhaustion until the horns of of of hell until that dog or whatever would come and capture and for every sinner the horns of hell are on your Trail they are yapping at you they won't let you sleep at night sometimes I've been speaking with young people sometimes they will tell you I don't even have sleep at all do you know when you SE so far away from God you even lose sleep and many people would tell you I can't sleep some they even have to take medication in order to sleep you see why because those hounds of Hell cannot let you sleep you see the devil will take you in sin and then he will take your rest away your bed becomes hard your P so becomes so hard you cannot sleep and you don't have rest and there is no peace because you hear you know that trail coming maybe sometimes it is even something that you hear they're just sneaking up in the [Music] shadows I've spoken to young people who have been going through these things something you feel like something ready to come and pounce on you and then you feel very vulnerable so helpless friends I want to tell you this morning I want us to enter into a hospital room let us examine Our Lives as individual outside of Christ we are vulnerable without the Holy Spirit you are vulnerable this deer would be attacked by the walles because they were uneasy pray without the Holy Ghost we also we are uneasy pray is a pray for sin and is a pray for addictions and is a pray for the attack of the devil Upon Our Lives and many of you have even promised and say Lord I will be tomorrow from today you make vows and you make promises to God and I said that can never work if you you are here and it has worked for you raise up your hand you will make vows and Promises only to break them because why your adversary the devil is after you he is there in the shadows he's over there on the next Hill he's around the next C waiting on you everywhere you look he's waiting on and in the message that I told you I'm reading from he says and that's a very good type of the devil you take a beautiful woman or a handsome young man that's a very easy prayer the very prayer for the sins of this world just to pray a little innocent boy of 16 or 17 a little girl just pray to the devil to Feast on when the devil sees you he sees you as an easy pray if you are not filled with the Holy Spirit these wild dogs lay in Ambush you know the Can sin crouches at your door he said I seen it in Africa and other countries and they jump on this little deer the very first thing they do is to try to break this string behind their legs the first thing they do is to try to break that string and they they they they can't run we call it an Hunter's Voice or they call it hamstring and then if he cannot grab them there he grabs them by the throat the devil finds for the weak the devil looks for the weak spot he jacks the jugg vein [Music] lose and it BS to death just in a moment then there is a flank in the deer and he will run and Jack his teeth into that when you know it has been done like that and maybe a vein has been removed or maybe it cannot run then it will start running for his life you know if he's a very big heavy dog and a small deer he can throw that deer on the ground from the flank he's got him in the mid Center and he swings the deer off his feet as the dog grabs it and throws himself over he throws the deer to the ground and they go right in and just tear that little fellow to Pieces I'm showing you how the devil attacks the you are that little dear the devil doesn't want to do anything to you but to destroy I want to ask you a question this morning especially to you that are still living in a life of sin what do you think that sin has to offer sin has never offered anything good sin offers broken homes sin offers ruined lives of children imagine if you as a mother or you as a father lives in sin it will offer you a broken family last time I preached on the generation of Overcomers the power of the Next Generation and I told you that the power of the next generation is in you you have the power to stop from coming to your children but whatever you do not overcome whatever you don't get over it will go through you and come to the Next Generation a life of sin will only off ruin children when you get down to the end of the road well maybe you are now or 60 or 70 you might have a great big house you might even become a great person in this life but really I want to ask you a question what does that offer you one day you are coming to the end of it all all of us one day we are going to come to the end of this and the end actually is closer than we think because there is a Rapture promised we still believe in the Rapture the Rapture is going to happen and all the wrath of God will now be powered to the world after [Music] the he says many times the mouth of the flesh pulls [Music] out going back to the deer and the deer is so quick and the deer can maneuver his little body so fast that sometimes he can get a away then when the dogs are rolling before before he can get up the deer can get away but if there is any Hunters here well I know there is no Hunter here if but if there is a hunter that knows that a wounded deer there is one thing a wounded deer will try to do it will only to try to find water right away and I could imagine seeing the little deer with the blood running out of him he's watching he's looking for the water BR if that deer can get the water he will live that is how the deer is there is only one thing that serves a deer a de that has been attacked a de that is shedding blood one thing that saves that deer is water if only you could get to the water sometimes when you shoot a deer it is so wounded that it will never make it to the water and then sometimes he will just run and fall into the water and too badly wounded but some of them maybe they are wounded and wound and would die from the wounds but when they run and go into that water then they begin to drink and drink and drink and drink you know that water saes that amen praise the name of the Lord I'm continuing that quot he says I've trailed them many times when they cross the creek and drink run down the creek a little piece run up on the hill they cross back and get some more water he will just keep on running as as long as he can get water but if he doesn't get water he will perish that is what David said my soul is thirsty after you like the deer I must have you I must have God or I perish David discovered 500 women could not satisfy 500 women cannot satisfy even if you said I'm going to go in a life of sin you can never have so many that you will be satisfied he had to go and take somebody else's wife even with 500 women David could make all the plages and the promises but those also could not stop him from that there is also one thing only one thing that can hold you from a life of sin it is when this thir quen comes inside of your soul hallelujah amen amen all these appetites that you have could be for Al it could be for smoking it could be for women or men addictions or that let me tell you you can even if you were in the world and you said I will do it until I'm satisfied you can never be satisfied that thir that is placed in your heart was put there by God and it is only God who can satisfy that but you see the devil to bring in all these things to try and satisfy you but you cannot be satisfied and listen to me closely we continue that brother and tonight to this sinful World who's been beaten by The Mad Dogs of hell with all this modern jazz music talking about the Rock and the rap you know you young people you you like that you know the Rock and the rap and you know yeah yeah yeah what what what music you see and that television programs I don't believe that a Believer should have a TV in their house and begin watching those TV program TVs jokes and so forth like that maybe some of you have been watching those things you you know these people who do comedy brother when I'm not reading this you please switch it offing the people you know how do they call them the names of those comedians yes Maria and who else come on you know you've been watching those people you you imagine a Believer watching those things because you have an appetite you have a thir but those things can't satisfy you see they are cracking jokes and so forth like that you who is watching that kind of fil you listen to that kind of music you are beat by that Mad Dog you were trying to quench that thirst with stagnated Waters of the devil he says may your heart become so thirsty that you must find Christ or Die the deer as he thirst for the water Brook so my soul thirst after thee oh God just take a drink from there you will never have to hear another sermon on morals how to dress how to act how to conduct yourself how to make your hair you don't need to hear me to teach you on those things if only you can find this squ I'm speaking about Amen in the message the 6 C it says and what makes a man do wrong or he says and what makes a man do man do wrong or a woman do wrong what makes you do wrong when you don't want but you find yourself doing wrong what makes him drink and carry on is because there is something in her thirsting and something in him thirsting and they are trying to quench that Holy thirst with the things of the world when God ought to be that quencher he made you that to thirst that's the reason you thir for something God made you that way so you would turn that ho thir to him but when you try to quench that s how dare anybody do that you have no right to do that you have no right to try to quench that Holy thirst that you thirst for something and you turn it into the world you try to satisfy it with the world you cannot do that there is only one thing that will fill that up and that is God and he made you that way to thirst and to thirst so that you can be able to quench your thirst and sometimes we look at people who have done awful s and we look at them and exclaim oh the big Sinners oh even this all she's an awful sinner she's an awful sinner but if you could look at it and see it is a thirsting human being doesn't matter what you have done in your life you've done it because you were thirsting a thirsting human being if you look at them like that then you would look at them as a thirsting human being having a thirst but if you know one who can quench that you will want to give them a drink if you see someone pting and you have water you can offer them water I have some drink I want to offer you this morning he didn't come to call the righteous to repentance but Jesus came to call the Sinners and the ungodly he came to save the Sinners he came to save the worst Sinners he came to redeem the worst he came to clean up the worst that is who he came for he came to you who is a deep worst sinner because you have a thir in you it is you that he wants to quench in Isaiah 55 we read it he said oh everyone that thir he's calling out he says oh everyone that thir is this his word how many believe it this his word he's calling out your name he says hey who is thir he's calling out he's saying stop everyone who is fasting he says Come Ye to the waters he that has no money come come and buy without money without price come and buy wine oh hallelujah hallelujah what is this wine this is cumulation of Revelation amen come and buy milk come and buy money without money without price why do you spend money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which does not satisfy you spend your time you spend your labors for worldly music for women for girls for boys for for for videos that don't satisfy he says hacken diligently unto me and eat ye that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in fness Incline your ear come unto me here and your soul shall and I will make an Everlasting Covenant with you I say here my Lord amen this is a great opportunity the word is calling out from the Bible amen you say well I wish I would God would speak to me just look at the scripture he's very busy speaking to you and many of you be I wish God care for he came all the way down from Glory because of your sin because he knew you were thirsting and he was was a first quencher no one ever cared for you like Jesus no one else would ever give his life for you it is only Jesus that cares for you it is only Jesus that can quench that and you say well I don't believe that Jesus can save me but I tell you if you don't believe that I will tell you what you can believe you can sure believe that the devil will send you to hell you can believe that the life you're living will destroy you and it's destroying you so why don't you turn around and believe in something good in something better in something that can satisfy your in the message without money without price he said there is so many entertaining things of our days there is much to entice the people and that's the truth the the time and the age we are living in there are many things that would entertain people videos game uh even the video games themselves you have the games on the phone you know you you have a lot of things music of the world that would entertain you pornography is just right on you just you have these smartphones you can access it any time all these things of the world that the devil has to offer you would which will entice you and this to what we it will entice you to what we would call pleasures and it's for All Peoples and all [Music] ages you cannot say that only for this age [Music] group these things I'm talking about cut across regardless of your age whether you are married or you are single the devil has all these offerings out there for us the there are the enticements for the young people the modern dances the rock and roll parties the rap you find all these things all over social media and all these boys and girls are dressed a certain way and they're behaving a certain way and you you feed on that and feed on that and feed on that and if feel if I do what this one is doing I'll be satisfied but soon you realize that cannot satisfy and the music that they have that goes with it and it's all enticing for the entertainment don't think it is it is not enticing these things are enticing it will call you it wants to destroy you when we in church with that's it is enticing you begin listening and you what's wrong with it West Life hey West Life and all this other music which you know the rap music and other kind of music it wants to destroy you you think that is harmless it is not that's not true it wants to take you to a life of self-pity and depression you hear a man who was who was singing about sadness how they forsook them you hear someone who's singing about you know how people are not trustworthy how people are animals how people are bad and you know how you can only believe in yourself and in your heart and you know these things are from hell and they have come to destroy your soul it wants to take you to a life of self to a life of depression to a life of anxiety to a life of pain it wants to take you where your little children if you have little children will be rugged where your marital life will be red and your little wife your little husband will be broken and your home will be broken up and we have seen so many hes that's what the devil wants to do to you those kind of things glorify sin the rap you get so into that kind of rap music where you begin shaking and you're dancing your way to H it is jacking you and pulling you to and not knowing is actually pulling you every step of the way pulling you to hell you think you are dancing or you think you just break dancing but you are dancing your way to Hellen this is what the devil is doing in this generation to try and satisfy The Thirst in our hearts but none of these things can satisfy Hallelujah I don't care how good a home a child you know has been brought up in and how he been told to do right if that child hasn't accepted the experience if that child has not accepted the experience of the new rock and roll music will catch his attention as quick as he hears it I've seen it with my children you go out there and you know the moment they put on a song right quick you find this little child who has been raised in a good home where no worldly music has where he has even never heard a song but he he has this worldly song and soon you begin feeling this church what is it you know because him in him is Born By Nature a spirit in your nature you're born with a caral spirit and the power of the devil is so great today till it catches that Spirit of that little child and you find the child Jack even in the way by the way if you put on a Christian song they cannot sing like that when you put on a Christian s you will see them entering the spirit you know even a little child of one year you'll see them lifting up their hands and just worshiping something there is a thirst in us friends that thirst is in us we are born with it can only be qued by God by the Holy Ghost even a little child amen when you put on a song that worships God you begin to see them lifting up their hands and beginning to worship but he put on worldly music they cannot do that jacking and a little child as long as that child has not been filled with the Holy Spirit that's why we you all need the Holy Spirit regardless of your age John receive the holy spirit in his mother's womb if you can hear the voice of my sound this morning I'm telling you you need the first quench hallelujah amen when you quenches your thirst you can never desire that kind of filthy music and how much more will it do to the old then if it can do to a child like that that what will it do to the old that has rejected the new bir because only as your life is changed and you've been converted and born a new into the kingdom of God your nature will still be of the things of the world no matter how religious you are unless that has been changed in you you may be in church you may sing you may playay your ti you may dance to the music of the church but you go out there your nature will still be the nature of a crw because we are born with that nature listen to me church we all are born with the nature of sin we are all born with the nature of the world with wrong appetites it doesn't matter which family you're born in that nature is there and the only way that nature can be changed is by being filled with the Holy Ghost amen because your heart is tasting and you need to be quenched you could worship and be religious but still that will have some kind of a drawing power to you but once once once let Christ take the throne in your heart those things don't bother him it is so much greater when you receive the Holy Ghost those things don't bother him it is not you it is him because it will be he will be in you if he's on the throne of your heart we cannot be bothered by worldly music by sexy kind of dressing by by all these addictions of the world it won't bother him it can bother you it won't bother him and if he's on the throne of your heart it won't bother him anymore you will hear preaching you'll come to church and then you go and listen to the music and you will be like that Samaritan these are people the Samaritans that were placed in in places that they were taken out of their their country and be placed in captivity somewhere and when they reach that land where they are they have their own Gods but to appease the people of the land where they're living they have to to also learn the ways of their [Music] God they would worship the gods of that land and also worship their gods and so you become a Samaritan if you you don't receive the holy spirit because you will come in the church you will hear the preaching you will love it you will accept it you will worship you cry and all that will happen and then you go outside there and you listen to the music of the world and you watch all those filthy movies and you will be attracted by those things not because you w but because there is an issue with your nature there is still a thirst in you you've not Oh Glory Hallelujah you've not found [Music] you will pay homage to this God and then God pay homage to other praise the name of the Lord in Jeremiah 2 verse 13 it says for my people have committed two evils they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters and hor them out [Music] system broken system Hallelujah that can hold no [Music] water praise the name of the Lord Prophet says that there are people sitting here as church members you want to do right but you drinking from a tank speaking to people this morning you want to do right but you're drinking water from a tongue you are glued to those things of the world you are going to the religions religions imagine God we even sing songs that God took us out of religions so glad that he brought me out we have nothing good in there we were in those denominations those are tanks we cannot be quenched if we drink from the tong they will never tell you this truth you just accept you just accept whatever you want to accept and go on and think that is good enough this has got to quench all of your thirst the only thing to come is to take the promise of God the only thing is to come is to take the promise of God and to come to that Fountain then he will quench The Thirst he that drinks from this Fountain oh you remember that woman Jesus told her amen he that drinks from the water that I shall never thir again hallelujah hallelujah amen some of the things I'm speaking about I had thirst for them as well but it is because I was still thirsty but Brethren once I drank from this Fountain thirst and I tell you brother if you can take a seep from this Fountain you will never fast again in the book of in the Book of John 7:37 he says in the last day that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him come to me and let him drink he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water but this SP he of the spirit Hallelujah am what is the Holy Ghost is rivers of Living Water begin bubbling in your heart out of you is a River of Life if you drink from this water your will beu he says but this of the spirit amen which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah I want to say this message what we are preaching to you it is more than keeping rules of the message it is more than that because we've seen many you know you can come and and dress properly in the church and go out there and dress as a a prostitute why because you've not yet been quenched you still are thirsting you you don't just have to come here and say well I believe God sent a prophet I believe in the mess it is more than just believing tell your neighbor it is more than just believing and I want to ask you have you received the Holy Spirit since you believed can you believe hallelujah amen because many of us many message Believers have believed but they have never received believing and receiving is two different things believing and receiving are two different things if you believe you must receive if you believe you must receive never say I didn't preach it I'm here to preach it now if you believe what I'm preaching you can receive if you receive it is more than believing but if you believe you can still go to hell if you don't receive Devils believe and tremble because they have never received I can tell you how you can know whether you have received or not because if you have received then out of your innermost being shall flow Rivers gashing out you cannot stop that River you cannot Dam it up you cannot make it quick that river is going to Bubble Up every day in your life sister when you in trials that River will bubble when you in Temptation that River will bubble amen when the hes of Hell come chasing after you that River will Bubble Up that is a river that comes from a fountain and it shall never run dry in Jeremiah 23 it says they have forsaken me the Fountain of Living Waters oh Lord the hope of Israel all that forsake thee shall be ashamed they have departed from me and they that have departed from me shall be written in the Earth because they have forsaken the the Fountain of Living Waters and he says Heal Me Oh Lord and I shall be healed serve me and I shall be saved for thou art my praise tell your neighbor if you're going to be healed it will have to be that God will heal you so he say serve me and I will be saved heal me and I shall be healed he is the Fountain of Living Water he is the only thing that can heal those scars of your life he can heal the scars of your life and wounds of your life that the hounds of Hell have torn you and destroy you they have wrecked and ruined your life and to some they have even them mentally and spiritually the devil will disgrace you and bring you down to the very bits of Hell to the lowest of humanity but guess what when he the Savior come he can save you he can redeem you out of hallelujah amen you cannot go so far amen where he cannot reach you cannot reach further down to what he can be able to look up his arm is not short that he cannot reach you where you are you cannot s so far away that his grace cannot save you you canot be so bad that he cannot make you go that's why is called a savior he is the savior of the body you cannot sin so much that he cannot change you again all it takes is to drink someone will say me I am damaged it doesn't matter brother sister you cannot be so damaged that he cannot repair you there is nothing he cannot do because he's the savior of the Soul amen that's why he came down he came down as a Savor he came down to change the situation hallelujah amen he said Heal Me Oh Lord and I will be healed save me and I'll be saved for thou are my praise hallelujah amen glory to God about him doing it and then it shall happen upon my life John 653 he says then Jesus said unto them very verily I say unto you except ye eat the Flesh of the son of man that is the word and drink his blood that is his Spirit ye have no life in you whosoever eats my flesh and drink my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is meat indeed and my blood is meat drink he that eateth my flesh the word and drinketh my blood the dwelleth in me and I in him my flesh which is his word his strength it is the nutrient of the soul and my blood is saying my blood is the spirit and it is the water that brings nourishment to your soul Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 123 for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one Body by one What Spirit whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be born of free and we have all been made oh my God he say that I've been made to drink into one Spirit we are been made to drink who has made us to drink Jesus has made you to drink we know we know what it means by drinking the blood it is taking his life the spirit into our lives he is the drink that your soul is thirsting for once you take the a drink of this water nothing else will satisfy hallelujah what she drink of this water nothing else will Su all the other appetites you will wonder what happened to you everybody will wonder what happened to you the people you used to chat with and you were so active when they send you a message they will ask you what is wrong with you you are so cold on me why I wish I had a voice to shout why because you drank from this dream and your was you are no longer thirsty after the things of the world Hallelujah and the spirit and the bride say come Revelation come the spirit and the B say come and let him that Hearth come let him that is at first come and whosoever will it doesn't matter who you are if you want it he says come let him take the Water of Life freely John 635 andto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never praise the name of the Lord amen in the book of Isaiah 422 44: it says thus say the Lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb friends are you not so happy that he formed you he made you in the womb he called you and he ordained you you are not just some coincidence you are no accident it doesn't matter how you were born you are not an accident you might have been a surprise to your mother your parents you might have been a surprise to them but you are not a surprise to God he knew you were coming he knew I was coming he knew you were coming he joined this one and that one this one and that one to get you because he wanted you to be made up like a bear he wanted to make you like a bell that is made up with all kinds of different metal until that Bell will give a certain sound a certain thing God made you that way because he wants to use that team for his glory and you have been beating you have been beaten your brains out you've been beating removing that sound and for the tinging for him and yet that was made for [Music] God why because you were thirsty he said th say the Lord that made thee and formed thee from the womb he will help you fear not and thou J whom I have chosen for I will power water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the dry ground I will power my spirit upon your SE and my blessing upon your your [Music] off these are not my words these are not my promises these are the promises of God to us hallelujah amen I would say oh God power that water upon that seed of God in Me spring up all well your land is thirsty he said he will power water not only water but floods upon the Thirsty ground praise the name of the Lord many people will accept Jesus as their and they will accept him to pay their sin debt but they will stop there I want to look at an example let's say you have an enous debt that you could not pay you have a house but the title is in the bank and you have failed to pay the loan with interest rising and it comes to a level whereby you cannot the money lenders are beginning to threaten to take your your car because you have a lot of unpaid areas so you don't own any other assets you don't have any money to your name you can hardly make ends me everything is terrible because you have a huge de and you cannot pay that debt you see that situation you know how it is when the creditors are calling maybe some of you have been there before and they hounding you and cannot answer and even when you answer the phone you you don't know is it the maners how many have ever been in that situation don't raise up your hand is it the moneyers you are so filled with anxiety and when you are in that situation goes off because the units are finished while you are there the bank sends you a letter we are taking a possessing your house because you have failed [Music] toay pay this debt or we will take this house that's how it is with our soul the the devil is like pay this debt or will take your soul into prison we will burn it like the in the Lake of Fire we are coming after your soul you know like this man is walking working himself up walking as much as he can but he cannot pay the debt because the debt is big and finally some man comes along a billionaire Rich he comes along and pays your enm and he says I want to do something for you I want to pay off your house I'm going to pay off your car I'm going to pay all theill I'm going to pay it off today when I give you this check you are going to be debt free you know what will happen to you you would have peace you will have relas you will be so emo you will cry you will shout you will just go to everybody and tell them my debt has been paid the debt I couldn't pay was paid you would feel a weight lifted from your shoulders you would go speak skipping on the streets and telling everybody hallelujah hallelujah now whenever they call you you're not you're not afraid to take a call you are not hiding somewhere you don't expect any threatening call my dat has been paid hallelujah hallelujah amen it is all paid you can now go and have a new life but you can also go and make a new debt now listen closely even though that one that one that man paid your debts and he became your savior to save you from loss you still wouldn't have his life or his nature you still wouldn't have his nature and that's where many Believers are my debt was paid I'm free I'm free from sin I'm happy Jesus saved me and you know what they do he paid my debt and they go take other debt they come back again to the church oh God this one also it is paid it is finished he paid my debt again they go take another why you you still can make more debts because you don't have the nature of the debt pay that is what is lacking in many Believers of course you feel the weight lifted you will be so happy you will shout in the Holy Spirit you will roll on the floor you will be so happy but when you go your life your nature is the same that's a clear sign you did not actually receive the holy spirit because your nature is the same but if you want to know that your Nature has changed the nature of The Debt Pay will be in you and you cannot make any more debt Jesus said he that believeth on me out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water praise the name of the Lord now all your Sensations this is the message Investments brother brother B preached this in 1963 he says now all your Sensations as we Pentecostal people like to jump and Shout he said I believe that's all right we like to speak with Tong I believe that's a gift of God the devil can impersonate that you can produce that in that line so that's not a proof that you have received this Holy Spirit I'm speaking of you may speak in tongues you may shout in the Holy you may be so happy but still that can be impersonated you will find this this kind of teaching only in the message out there they think because they can shout they have the Holy Ghost because they can speak in Tong they have the Holy but yet when you come and see their life their life is rotten their life is the same their sin nature is still sitting on the throne of the heart but he says notice then it shows that something is wrong The Life of Christ isn't flowing through the church the way it sh the body the bride is not going through there like it should it is clogged up somewhere clogged up some because if you have the spirit of God your nature will change what is wrong today in many churches across the land what is clogging up the church accepting the Theology of the blood we are accepting the teachings of the word but we are not born of the spirit the blood of Jesus Christ is more than our substitute he is also our sin offering surely paid our debts but in this Covenant there is more to eat than just receiving money from the rich man receiving the life of that rich one Jesus is our Kingsman Redeemer he was so rich to pay all the debts of the whole world then take your sins and put them in the sea of forgetfulness [Music] and make you a Son of God where the little life of Jesus Christ returns back again upon your life and changes your nature not a patched up life not turning a new Leaf when the new year begins you say I'm going to begin you change your sim card you change your friends you change your rece and then in the next two weeks you are rotten again why because you simply turned a new you never died the only way for you to be born again is to die fast if you still love the world and the things of the world there is no evidence that the life of God when he comes all the things are what passed away and behold the Bible says all things are new if you even ever go in the Rapture you are going to have that same Spirit which was in Jesus Christ you have going to have the same life that he had the only way you will ever go in the Rapture is to become born again of the Holy Ghost hallelujah hallelujah many Believers come having good intentions saying I'm going to go all the way but you go as far as accepting the pardon and and forgiveness of your sin debt but you don't go ahead to receive the divine that is why sister brother you find it very hard to stay out of debt that's why you continually have to come back again again to the altar because you have had somebody pay your debt and yes you feel better and you can even sleep very well at that night and you even have a good hope but that real faith is not there that real faith says if there is one going in the Rapture it is me going how many here have that Faith don't just raise up your hand now that you can surely say if there is one going in this church and the if Jesus was to come now and he's taking one I'm that one I can't speak for anyone else but I know friends I met God I know and that should be everyone's confession his life came into me and I'm filled with the Holy Spirit and out of me is coming rivers of Living Water that should be your testimony but people go through the church and they don't they fear to go to hell but you see you are still attracted to that little girl to that little boy who has beautiful hair and these days they like to make a bit wavy and you look at that and you're attracted to that and every little girl you see brother you are still lustful towards her you pulled that way you pulled this way then the next day you are very busy watching fil and if you love the things of the world the love of God is Not In You in you know friends this has I said I wanted us to have a conversation this is the place where you need to arrive and say I am sure I have the spirit of God in my heart and if he was to come now I'm going in the RT that's where you have to be brother but if you still love the world the things of the world the love of God is not in order to get that love of God into your heart you have to die where to the place where that love for cigarettes will die where that love for those filthy movies will die and sometimes we debate on what is filthy and what is not filthy and many of you have asked me Pastor is it wrong to watch movies and my answer is always no and so then we will see what is out of you is there a river out of you because if there is that River of living water coming out of you there are certain movies you will never put your eyes on whether they look harmless or not you're going to have a different appetite you see it's it's going to be more than Pastor can I do this or can I not do that is it okay is it okay for me to do my hair this way can I do that or can I not do that you see you going to go beyond that he that has received the spirit of God does not live under the law you are actually beyond the law you are no longer being ruled by dos and don'ts the sin has died praise the name of the Lord I'm so thankful that about 18 years ago in my life you know I met this th quencher I had a lot of th in my life if I begin listing them right now I may not finish right now but when I met that he quenched my thought nothing else is desirable you give me a beer I'll just laugh at I don't have the appetite say oh God I love the I I don't have a he died oh you've been married 11 years you are old you have no feelings for other women don't be deceived it's just that I died [Music] I died and brother you have to die sister you have to die to that desire of having sexy clothes to the extent that we will come and preach about clothes in the church we should never preach on clothes in the church you if everybody in the church has made that that will be a thing we don't even talk about but where you find in the church every service every the preacher is talking about your clothes your D your it shows there are many who have not even received the Holy Ghost and there are many who claim I have the Holy Ghost and they dress like Bel Jezebel and you have the Holy Ghost that Holy Spirit will throw away makeup will throw away all these trousers of women there is nothing like trousers of women no nothing like that in the Bible there's only trousers for men and when I say that I mean not only in church everywhere in your bedroom on the road at work anywhere a Believer is a Believer the holy spirit fs on the same same the Holy Spirit cannot feed on them things of the world those appetites will die some of these apps that you are own when you receive the Holy Ghost theti will die because the food which is there is no longer yours when you receive the Holy Ghost we shall have more people on Wednesday in the church because you are hungry for the world you are hungry for the for God you can hardly stay at home and say I will stream you just have the anger and The Thirst like that deer for the things of God and the word of God and the songs of Z before you receive the holy the Holy Ghost you are believing eternal life but you don't have eternal life until you receive the Holy Ghost hey do you know that did you know that until you receive the Holy Ghost you don't have etal life why only those who have eternal life are going the Rapture so if we say anybody who believes that Jesus died for them has received eternal life without receiving the Holy Ghost it means everybody who is called a Christian will go into but the foolish virgin stayed why because they believed in Jesus but they did not receive the Holy Spirit and so they could not make it to the Rapture so if you are wise receive the Holy Spirit you have to have the thirst for it the devil knows the church is pregnant and so he comes along to try to give a a hard Breeze to the church to breathe that church that wants to kill the child there are some of you now that are ready to receive the Holy Ghost I know you are in needing something something is missing somewhere but you are consoling yourself saying I'm all right you know I believe the message but I believe it you know even my mothers I've been in church for some years you know there is something that is lacking in your life if you know it you know it there is something lacking in your life something has to happen until you you know it doesn't matter who is there you shout out Glory Hallelujah that kind of joy that is bubbling from the soul and then you let go of the world and then you let go of sin without anybody seeing you or watching you or foring you until you become crazy to the world until you get a brand new mind until your thinking is even changed that is what needs to happen brother sisters even your behavior will change it changes your dress it changes your attitude it changes everything about you because the life of the one who paid your debt comes into your life and and and and and you will never make another date again he says that out of his Bell shall flow rivers of living and this is a good example here that I want to give you I wish we had a pipe here do we have a pipe anywhere here brother a pipe you see the prophet L did to stop stopped a pipe a stopped up a pipe that is B you know the the holy spirit is here he is trying to force himself he's pushing down he's appearing in this age even here in the recent weeks in the church we have seen he has given Saints and wonders he's pushing and pushing and pushing but you have got something that has stopped up the floor rivers of Living Waters is here of their potentially Among Us it's there it is not flowing In Your Vessel but it is here maybe it is stopped up because you are content with just a substitute that you have you are just ified with just sins forgiven and because the weight of sin is gone knowing that you are not going to hell I don't know what is in your life but you know you know the flow is not there that flow of the holy spirit is not there you know it that cannot be told to you you know and if it there you also know something has stopped it up and it is supposed to flow it is kind of like working on a pipe and you know the water is there is there a pipe here and you know the water is there and and and you know you know the pressure is there something has got it stopped up you run this little wire and you know then brother martin knows these things because it's a plumber and then you get a wire and then you you you pierce it through and then you you begin to Zig Zig Zig Z and push it there until you can feel that thing which is blocking the water I can get down to this far and I can't get any further push a little more and it just bends back some unbelief or sin has got the PIP sto now let me tell you let me stop here a moment I tell you preachers can come here or I can come your pastor any other brother preach you happy but when you are on your way to miss the Rapture what profit what profit you gain out of that you can sit in the Church of a Believer and at the end of it all you miss the Rapture the Rapture is going to happen God has sent us the the last day Prophet with a message that is preparing us we seeing that it's the old time Holy Spirit and the devil won't go near we not talking about the knowledge we talking about the life of [Applause] it when you receive that Holy Spirit it quen someh quenches all your thirst and you can never thirst for the things again but what happens is we have a lot of things that is blocking that River from flowing in our life some of you is anger some unbelief some kind of sin that doing in your life but you better get to where you don't care what people think you have got to want it more than anything else you have to put off anything else some of you maybe maybe when I finish campus I will concentrate and seek for it or when I finish school or when I when I marry finish marriage how about if you do it right now you better put it ahead of everything it has got to become first in your life I must have this or perish I'm thirsty you have got to get down to where it means more than anything to I have got to get that Flor you have heard the pastor talking about that River I want that flow to flow through me I want that life to flow through me you know if it means you know what did Peter do when he went in the upper room that's what he was doing there was something blocking you know Peter had Peter was a deceiver he was a denier you know he denied Jesus he was not he was a liar he said I'll be with you even if for so these things were there to sin sing his life blocking his life from that flow but make no mistake Peter was a preacher Peter was even casting demons did you know that but that flow was not there Peter had a calling on his but that flow was not there when it comes to the test the Temptation he that flow was not there there was nothing bubbling up in him the only thing he would run to was Canal picked up a knife said I'm ready who is going to ATT my master killed somebody Peter was so full of canal maybe many of you are still full of canal but I'm telling you I would be a liar if I don't tell you this things but if I tell it to you brothers and sisters then it is your responsibility to take something and begin push push out when Peter went into the upper room what do you think he went to do he went to push he was pushing out that deception he was pushing out that busting he was pushing out that Li he was pushing out all those kind of things and as he push and he push and he pushed woo hallelujah hallelujah that River began flowing it came with a lot of pressure you know that water which has been cloged and then then the clogging comes out it comes so much gashing pressure it began coming out and they started talking in tongues and and then the people came down he said hey what's happening here you said no you people you drunk Peter who was fearful he was no longer fearful he had found the thir question at first he had fear he could not stand for Jesus maybe some of you have friends and you can't stand for the before your friends he's coming right down to your address I want to ask you as individuals how many here have their friends and your friends know what you believe you don't need to raise up your hand just think about it all your friends know from your left and to your right they all know what you stand for they all know that God sent a prophet in your generation they all know that you believe in Jesus God they all know that you believe in water baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ they all know you going to the rupture I can tell you for sure if they don't know I'm sure you will be where they will be after during the Rapture you will be where they will be because if they don't know it is just evident you don't know you know but you have not experienced but what we are talking about we must experience it we must experience it and Peter when he reached there at first he was fearful when the girl came to him you have been with them no no no I don't know but at that moment right there when when the Holy Ghost came down Peter changed what do you think happened think about it from denying before a little girl to speaking before a crowd of 3,000 some of you young men you can't even go on the street there when they tell you Brothers we are going through Crusade you go you even fear to car your Bible some of you some of you come to your Bible with your Bible sneaking to church you know saking and some of you even put a newspaper on it no one should see me with a Bible what would they think because they know what you were doing so when they see you with a Bible they would say even you have a Bible are you a Christian so you cover the Bible in a newspaper when they ask you where are you going you're so smart today so now I'm going to visit my uncle what is that it's just some newspapers you've not got that experience brother when you get that experience you are going to stand before all when it comes to preaching publicly you will stand on the road we are going to start that we will call you young your microphone he the microphone and then he begins to see them fidgeting those ones who have not yet been quench no no I I'm requesting Pastor not in a bad way kindly ask the other brother because not a good speaker but the praise can you take a microphone and stand on the road and declare what you believe to others you I'm talking to answer that question to before I leave it can we can we conclude with this brother somewhere can you do that give your microphone tell them about can I also come to you brother NE if you are saying you can do it Brethren why are you not doing it yet you want the pastor to come and preach here you want him to preach on radio you want him to preach on the funeral you want him to preach on the street where are the younger men where is the Zeal what is happening why are the people dying when they are living what has made them busy you are very busy satisfying your thirst which will never be satisfied with the things of the worlden if you find this thiren that I'm speaking about today you will be so much bubbling in your heart you will be in in your soul what else can I do for the Lord what can I do but for you you don't even have a Bible since I receed the Holy Ghost my Bible has been my friend and I've never been ashamed to take pictures with my Bible some people when they want take pictures for me here I want to take my my my pictures with my Bible my Bible I love it I am not ashamed of It in America today they are even rejecting it in schools time will come when to be with the Bible is a shame but I tell you in heaven it is a shame not to identify with the word of God and today preachers are ashamed to identify themselves with the word of God how can you even claim to be a Bible believing Christian and you don't have a Bible or you have a Bible but you always forget that I might even decide to ask how many here have Bibles can you proudly lift up your Bible and we will know whether you read your Bible or not because when we open it we shall see it very clear then know you never read your Bible what am I trying to say you have a thirst but you're quenching it with other things come to the world come to the Fountain go back again to the original desire the things of God because this can satisfy your soul Hallelujah brother sisters when you are satisfied with this that I'm speaking about you know you receive a flow a flow of power a flow of joy a flow of love you will not have hatred in your soul you have a flow of the life of God whereby you will love everybody makes me love everybody makes me love everybody you know you will begin walking away from your sin you will you will even you yourself in your heart you will truly now know oh this is what it means to love God I surely love God with all my heart but when you say it it is through that floor that is bubbling up when we sing songs you can see people who have that FL they're singing they're flowing in the Flor they have the life but when you don't have the floor you are in the church but you feel like as if you been knocked and maybe someone has died yeah what can we do all over [Music] me keeping me alive keeping me alive keeping me alive and then you are very busy sing your friends all over keeping me Al there is no flow the thing is dry brother is that how you want it to be is that how you want it to be is that how you want to leave do you know the holy spirit is real and he feels people who desire you and when it comes upon you there will be a bubble he will be everywhere when you begin worshiping you don't even know where the tears come you don't even know you just feel something bubbling inside of you if you have what I'm talking about you know what I'm talking about but if you do not have what I'm talking about you're missing out a great deal when you are in Temptation that moments when you alone and you are tempted that flow will begin bubbling bubbling up bubbling up and you will see yourself going through that Temptation because it says lead us not into temptation Deliver Us from Evil who does that that one in you he that is in you is greater than your Temptation you will go through through what others go through but you will have what I call special Grace to overcome to live above all these things that when they come they not Smite you they not put you down and you will live a real like a real man like a real woman and then you're going to have mothers real mothers who are going to pray for their children you do not know what it feels like for children to have a real mother that calls them not just to abuse them look at this stupid head no Sandra Sandra isabeth come here and then your mother will begin to talk to you and then afterwards touch you and pray for you in the Holy Ghost that's what it will make you mothers you sisters before you are even married receive this flow because when you receive it you will be real mothers to your children and you will raise a generation of Overcomers you will raise generation that fears the word of God that loves the word of God a generation that has the power of God living through that even when your child misbehave and does something weird you will call him says come here Al and then you Alan will know immediately mommy has known how did Mommy know Mommy has a flow hallelu mommy has the flow the river is flowing in Mommy Mommy will begin to tell this boy didn't you do this this and this just say yes mommy that's oh pray God forgive me what is happening do you think these things can happen they are already happening in some women who have this flow hallelujah amen you talk about John wisley talk about all this he was his mother suzan was a woman of prayer prayer comes out of a floor if you don't have the Holy Spirit you cannot know how to pray but if you have the flow you begin praying you begin praying and it's like you put on that strong you begin bubbling up within you it's like you are swimming in water you enjoy the prayer but when you pray without the Holy Ghost your prayer is dry and cranky God have mercy on me forgive me bless me bless my friend bless my father bless everybody and keep us in Jesus name that's not a prayer but when you pray the Bible says sometimes you know the holy spirit amen praise in you with groanings that cannot even be after who is Amen in the realm of prayer who has the holy spirit amen is just even what's with time they begin they begin to is going on there something in them that I'm talking about hallelujah amen and the river it is flowing through the them oh God is just coming from your spirit is just coming from from from you the rer of Joy friends if you are a wife you be a real wife if without that River you cannot make it you cannot make it you need that that's why don't even talk to think about marriage if you've not got that desire to get it what I'm speaking about is not a story it's a reality it's a reality we've seen it many times God giving people this praise the name of the Lord I'm just wanting to read what I read again he says he that believeth on me out of his belly out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water Jesus spoke to this woman and told her you remember we talked about it last time how she was thirsting having five men and she was not yet satisfied and the sixth one and Jesus said if you knew who I was the water I give you if I give it to you you will never thir again I have a question for you did this woman drink did she drink of that water did Jesus feed her person physically It Is by What It Is by faith Jesus was talking over a well of water and the water he had the woman started by laughing what are you going to get the water the woman did not Jesus was talking of a spiritual the world I'm speaking about not a physical well not Jesus was standing with that woman that well was there the woman was not seeing it by eyes but as Jesus was having that conversation with her eyes open she said H give me to drink give me to drink of this water said the water I give you if you drink it you will never thirst again and the the moment she said give me to drink the moment she said give me to drink Jesus said go bring me your husband now I'm trying to finish here why did Jesus go to that at that moment because you cannot drink without dying to your to the old [Music] you kill all the past remove all the sinful life remove all the unbelief remove all the doubts it all die and the woman had to confess with her own mouth and she said to Jesus I have no husband Jesus said you've said it you've been living with fire and the one you are living now is also not your husband she said yes what was that Jesus revealed the secrets of her life this is what was going on in the service to if anything was spoken about that you noise in your life Jesus was doing the same thing having a conversation with you is this how your life is see this is how you are see this is how you are see this how but I have a well of if I give it to you today you will never thirst again and the woman received the Revelation and the water pot she had she just threw it down and she took off and ran to the city say to the people come see a man come see a man that told me everything I have done the word of God is a designer of the thoughts and man God knows your heart more than anybody so if he has designed your life the question is are you willing your life can be change just like that I'd like us to stand on our feet I'd like us to
