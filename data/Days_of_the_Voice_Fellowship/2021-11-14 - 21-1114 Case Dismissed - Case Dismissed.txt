be i agree with you we should get out of here but uh i i one thing i don't agree until now is for us to go and rent a bigger i feel that we should be here and feel the heat and feel this small area where you cannot dance very well for the lord until you know maybe that condition will will help to squeeze out of us resources for us to have our own sight and i can see it is working several people who are pledged and uh you know they'll fulfill their pledges [Music] we say that we shall give you a report every end of month but you have been doing it every week [Music] and their contributions bring the total amount how much did we have last sunday sunday wednesday to already know who are you in america oh my gosh in america anyone taking records miriam is said to me to harukumi yes i think that's that's true no that's true three point one million is settlement different naturally banned private but put your need aside and first fulfill this way and that's what i've done myself and uh god has been blessing us era uh my brother here joelle i'm happy to see you magana you're waiting for fuller bless you i didn't expect you i know you work on sunday with the man now we we have two people that received christ on sunday and they were they were baptized was that on tuesday and they were baptized on tuesday in the name of our lord jesus [Music] okay so we know he was supposed to be going somewhere to work he came he was at my house for some days and also another young brother andrew no organ andrew the brother and uh when he came back i could not go him on tuesday if we can stand we stand because we respect and refresh the word [Music] our national anthem b there is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so the righteousness of the law is going to be fulfilled in us who do not walk after the flesh but after the spirit i mean for they that are after the flesh do do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit amen a [Music] this morning never and probably that was really hungry i take myself out of the way and i ask that the holy spirit will come and just speak to us this morning use me and my brother here my comment and speak to each of us oh you're getting a reception i mean i have your seats um uh how many enjoyed the meeting on wednesday it was a wonderful time those who missed abbas you really missed massimo and uh brother tim dodd is still around organ a team though the child you are i think you will be traveling back on monday no zaganda could die is being hosted by other brethren amen so we thank god that they were able to pass us by and give us the words always a wonderful thing to have a visiting minister then we also had meetings we had about those brothers have wonderful testimonies many of them could not did not go to school uh actually most of them did not go to school but one of them i i said i didn't go to school but the lord told me how to read i said are you sure can you test can you test for us one two weeks [Music] and he has a very big testimony on how the lord opened his eyes to be able to reach i now know this is and uh so the the other five were the five or six came from uh tesla region and uh we hosted all of them i think sister stella to be a part of the great what god is doing across this country um you know when you translate the message or the bible and you give it to the people and print it and give it to the people it's not a small one and we have been chosen by god to be a part of it [Music] and we had what brother team was preaching here on wednesday hey that's how you organize approximately you have to prosper oh you know amen i mean stick with the wife and especially help in giving out the world the lord has to prosper amen i mean so we are blessed to be a part of that great work i mean we have brethren who coming from eastern from western from even somewhere right to me from rwanda they want messages even ethiopia and we print that in our small office there turina uganda obama [Music] so we just give all the glory to the lord http by the grace of god i want to speak on case dismissed and last sunday i spoke on this the scene case sunday and i was speaking as a um as an attorney or something like that on what yesterday i took you i mean on sunday took you in a courtroom uh and we we looked at several interpretations of the law netherlands this young man here by the joel we also did speak something about this organ isaac also and i know to all of us this uh this is the word of god chicken but which one would because we believe it is life amen i mean so i'm going to request each of you to be very attentive that that sounds so well if you were in if you had a case and the judge says dismiss no doubt we are going to incorporate law and grace [Music] for now no condemnation to them which are in christ jesus christ so it means that there is therefore now condemnation to them that are not in christ so the sin will be imputed unto them that are not in christ [Music] [Music] another person also the lord will catch him according to the past president it takes to associate [Music] [Music] and what did he do he had to pay the price of sin the accessory motivated because of course according to the law if you as a sinner can pay the price of sin you are no longer a sinner [Music] and what was the price of sin so imagine if each of you has to pay for your sin cutting no lab are you a singing body no baby you have to be crucified crucified crucified but when jesus came on the scene [Music] [Music] then the circumstances of this case have changed in song and this case cannot be judged oh judgment cannot be passed according to the past precedent oh my proof yes god bless you here is the evidence this man is not a sinner the sentence was already paid because the circumstances have changed oh yes [Music] and i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven close to the cloud and the rainbow was upon his head and his feet was as it were the sun and his feet as pillars of fire nine [Music] as a matter of fact he said that his hair his head was had a rainbow and his face was as it were the sun and his fearless spirits of fire okay i want you to see something here it should be okay okay just just a moment give me a moment here i'll get it all right aha look at revelation chapter 1 verse 14. quickly now what does it say there you can actually begin from from uh 12 and i turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned i saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like the son of man closed with a gummy down to the foot and got about with the pups with the golden goddess his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire okay so [Music] sometimes we speak things and we think everybody understands the internet until you might be taking it yet not everybody understands what we're talking about so i want to show you here in just a moment how a judge looks address where in jakarta um i will not show you everything in this entirety but at least i will show you something which you can be able to relate with all right i mean okay just a moment here can you please put that up for me okay i think everybody can see that are you with me brother aburuganda truly finna can i have that on the screen uh-huh look the judge always wears that white wig wig i am ballet he's going to give a fair again that sort of sango going so do you see that yeah how many have you ever seen that so it shows that it's a good judge it's a righteous judge [Music] and his eyes were white like wool amen as white as snow and his eyes were at the flame of fire [Music] [Applause] and be able to die on the cross he thought that was just the boy of the of the father no he was not just the son or you're whatever you want god himself is [Applause] some of them still believe they are under the law everybody wants you i'm a taker and others think they are free from the law that is without understanding everybody [Music] what was the intention of the law you need to understand that the law is righteous that the law is righteous on the way no in your nature of birth you could only be under the law oh a sad word in a bed once you were taken because you were sinners of the of the righteousness of the law i think that way everyone sees the signs of your take the lord jailed you cathy and therefore the lord became the strength the law magnified your sin for all to see so we in our natural ability you feel negative about it you feel as if it is alone women should not wear trousers those are legalized why do you feel negative to what the word the bible says [Music] [Applause] because the things you used to like to do according to the flesh you can no longer do that your flesh was pulling on you to go and fornication are they seeing me is the pasta you will the bible in verse 2 says for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death is foreign [Applause] as i used to do i do them no more it was a glad day when i was born again eventually nazareth when i was born again oh great day when i was born it was a glad day when i was born again you can't even say the stealing i used to do i do you know he's gonna take how much the fornication when i was born again [Applause] oh the things you used to do is not you do it the things you do now it's not you doing them but it is christ that lives in you every indicative some people have made christ disgrace i want [Music] the life of god himself [Applause] ministers in the old testament our word is they were told everything that how they should do it the way they should treat them you know should not should not must not must not could not cannot they not ever take it now let me show you the love spirit of life in christ christians he will achieve his purpose but in the old hallelujah the desires lord [Music] is [Music] foreign oh yes [Applause] what did he think of him the scene yeah what he says if you look at a woman you lost after her no more fun you have already committed and they can even produce their photographs and they can mess up themselves in that kind of imagination no problem pornography oh [Applause] what for we know that the law is spiritual the law is spiritual tell your neighbor the law is spiritual come on tell your neighbor once again foreign we are talking about somebody who is not filled with the holy ghost here draw but what i hate that do i why would i change and my least the law will keep you and keep you in check all the time if there is no law maybe whatever i would take you will always do whatever you for i know that in me now then it is no more i that do it but sin did you see that but seeing that in me don't you think sister you love those trousers you don't mind enough faith for the worst antibodies go back and reason with you why do you love them right you're getting padding i want to look like so-and-so what is that that wants to look sexy is it your inner man oh your moon oh your flesh it's your flash mobility it's your flash mobility your flash wants to look sexy appealing show [Music] come on [Applause] [Music] what is it the devil is working on their flesh and they are working in the flesh but a holy ghost feel [Music] will tell you and i'm sure the spirit cannot tell you to be like bob marley because the spirit which was working in both my is not a spirit that works in us today you find them on the piano with younger men what kind of times have you never jealous that cannot discern as it is that they are not in the spirit of you if you are in the spirit they already among you you will walk but [Music] i used to have a very big chain i used to have a very big name because the spirit which was in me at a time i wanted to be if you feed on justin bieber you will soon want to be like him who don't know those names if her oh god that's why believe us i will not allow you to feed on them things m them you find the younger ladies [Applause] yes spirits of the world they can't see they have attacked the church you don't need a ganesha you find bastards oh god [Music] would i choose the renewing of your mind and the ones that submit our mind should not be that of the world in the world our mind should be that of christ [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah amen listen he says if then okay okay continue but give me that verse where do we stop coming for i know that in me that is in my flesh duel is no good thing and they even cross their eyes ah god bless you [Music] and they are saying for them they are spiritual for i [Music] is present with me that's for sure i have to perform that night if you walk in your flesh you can never do good bro sometimes if you have a holy spirit and someone annoys you you feel like barking at them you feel something within you telling you come on [Music] [Music] foreign not that i do now 20. now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that belief in me now your bank and you do something wrong no kurdish god does not look at it as sin hear me it's not because you did it willingly since now if i do that which i would not it is not me that does it it is sin that dwells in this flesh mobility sick watch cause why would they create you find some people doing wrong things one after the other filled child of god cannot even be overtaken i find then i was tempted and i fought myself in about really [Music] [Applause] shall we continue in sin [Music] so some people have their bodies living in so that you can walk in the spirit all time believe me you know we are spiritual beings oh man you truly be turned in the spirits it's because your flesh is dead one day apostle paul was not married he said it doesn't mean because i don't have the strength like a woman i you know so some of these things you need to die to them category that's why even the bible comes to talk about widows he says it's better for our world but he says but the younger ones foreign we need to die to the flesh for the good that i would i do not but the evil wish i would not that i do now if i do that which i would not it is no more that more i that do it but sin that dwelleth in me i find then a law that when i would do good evil is present with me that is a law i mean that i would that that i find a law that when i would do good evil is present with me myself we have read verse 21 where you know each of us has that piece of cane and that piece of ability that cane is in the flesh this flesh never receives the holy ghost holy spirit the holy spirit will prevent you from being uh oh stop by the flesh otherwise the flesh can overtake you and control your life you find people that are completely overtaken by the flesh they decided masters bad food ganger man yeah they begin taking it and they are always up there about our guru they feel that they can control the whole world [Music] text you don't want to be in that place whereby they are always hungry where is the hungry [Music] because your senses are the ones that control the flesh the sense of seeing he will take that and cause you to seek bad things that's a gift to your spirit your spirit will be dirty you find such people but even when they just do one look like this is so full of lust that it will hit somebody into forced imagination you know if you want to overcome certain things fight those things you need to fight what is causing you to do i will amen can you imagine some believers asking is it okay for christians to listen to worldly music really how can you even ask that question let me tell you if you are here and you listen to you listen to worldly music and see you need a feeling of the holy ghost because the moment you receive the holy ghost you cannot even have appetite for worldly music again a new heart and many things i can talk about but i want to just stick with my notes here and finish in a few moments now listen to this he says right the light in the law of god give us that verse again after the inward man i mean but i delight in the law of god after the inuit man right um but i see another law in my members and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members that is bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my body i want to see what they can do you remember read the book amen amen weep not john dokkan [Applause] who shall deliver me from this body of death i nearly entered amen you can't hear that there will be here and you are your ears will stop hearing though you can't touch that if you're very quiet your hands won't pack and then come and get a giant what is that to cherish you spirit of jesus christ crystal renewing us taking over the body because of the law of sin working in our motor bodies [Music] john 1st john chapter 3 verse 1 chapter 3 verse 9. [Applause] [Music] we are born of the seed of god will mature fame in life of god to do the righteous works by simply having faith in him [Music] [Music] really what was wrong with me because you weren't recording [Music] and democracy it's my glory still watching what was wrong with me why was i looking like like a dude you're watching a live angle like a dubai oh that was a spirit of like a debate [Music] um they dressed up in trousers you find people like those what do you have anywhere but just preaching about the law and grace gets dismissed with trousers and then the moment he says hallelujah hallelujah let us attend the that's the difference we have with other pentecostals shall we continue in the sin that grace may abound how can we that are dead if you have been filled with the holy ghost that word builds happiness and gives you a new appetite i have four biological children the first indication before we even know that she's pregnant appetite will change and then i'll be like what's wrong with him who told you i even if you want something she just says get something you don't some say that i dress like this because i am all getting older i used to dress like this you're going to give me that song in a moment but let me first read for you this quote oh brother you better get to goshen while there is time to get to question that and against them questioning what don't pay any attention to this outside every and he gives a story for us he says look here again here is a little lady twisting herself down the street oh why do you want kawaii can you go to and he is whatever he is naturally teaching but the first thing you know there is no hold post in there she will say hello oh [Music] foreign don't do it first thing you know orgando lava he's trying to make a date with him can we another way they don't even sweat that type of knee are natural never knows when they are meeting like this the men don't sweat satania knows when you want to meet someone that and you you you mean business you want to marry them in my brother [Music] you have no business making a date with her when she is not a believer and when she's not meant to be a wife kawasaki young what is wrong with you my mom is there mama one great what i'm not going to mama too a little bit i want to get married i will i will i will kill you i will okay you can imagine but now when she told me that but i continued my plans without her feelings rather these feelings we have in our bodies are supposed to be used in the right way because it's certainly impossible for a red-blooded male to walk before a female like that without something taking place it is impossible for you to do that and nothing takes place what about you but when there is something on the inside been trying caster that was your name i have no idea and they will say depart from me that work in equity yes something that you know what is iniquity it is something that you know to do and you didn't do it you would
