[56:17] we are complete in you.
[56:21] Lord, we know that your blood will never

[56:25] Someone here tonight that needs your
[56:27] saving grace,
[56:31] grant it to them, Lord, because your
[56:33] blood will never lose.
[56:36] Whatever that every brother, every
[56:38] sister has needle,
[56:41] may you, Lord, prove to them that the
[56:44] blood will never lose its life.
[56:47] It is as fresh as it was on the day when
[56:51] it was powered down.
[56:55] Lord, you is as powerful.
[56:58] It's as glorious.
[57:00] And we know it's the word of the hour.
[57:03] And as we are going to listen to the
[57:05] word tonight,
[57:07] I pray oh God, you will open our hearts.
[57:10] You give us liberty to speak.
[57:13] and you will open each of our hearts
[57:16] that you may minister to us.
[57:19] Lord, a little inspiration you've given
[57:21] to me tonight.
[57:24] May May I go be taken out of the way,
[57:26] Lord,
[57:28] even the interpreter,
[57:30] every one of us, Lord, that you may be
[57:32] able to speak to us,
[57:35] we commit this service to your heart
[57:38] in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus.
[57:41] Amen. Amen.
[57:45] I'd like to greet you saints in the name
[57:47] of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[57:50] Amen. Let's quickly go to uh the book of
[57:53] Matthew chapter 7
[57:58] vers um I have a lot to speak about
[58:00] tonight.
[58:03] So just pray for us
[58:06] that we'll be able to deliver it to you.
[58:14] Matthew chapter 7.
[58:25] I'm going to read
[58:30] 2.
[58:41] If you're there, say amen.
[58:46] &gt;&gt; Beware of false prophets which come to
[58:48] you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly
[58:51] they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know
[58:53] them by their fruits. Do men gather
[58:55] grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?
[58:58] Even so, every good tree bringeth forth
[59:01] good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth
[59:03] forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot
[59:06] bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
[59:09] corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
[59:14] Uh read verses 18 again. A good tree
[59:17] cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither
[59:19] can a corrupt tree bring forth good
[59:21] fruit. Every tree that bringeth not
[59:25] forth good fruit is held down and cast
[59:28] into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits
[59:31] you shall know them.
[59:33] [Music]
[59:42] forch.
[1:00:11] [Music]
[1:00:17] Amen. God bless you. May be seated.
[1:00:21] Thank you for making an effort to come
[1:00:22] to church today.
[1:00:25] It means a lot.
[1:00:27] It means a lot to you, to me, to to
[1:00:29] every one of us.
[1:00:32] It is important for you to come to
[1:00:34] church
[1:00:36] whenever there is a service.
[1:00:39] very important.
[1:00:42] You know, people make investments
[1:00:44] uh in real estate, what they call real
[1:00:46] estate
[1:00:48] [Music]
[1:00:49] and they call it real estate.
[1:00:54] But actually real estate
[1:00:57] investment
[1:00:59] is the time we spend with the Lord.
[1:01:04] If you close down your business,
[1:01:06] you come to church, you can never lose.
[1:01:10] It is impossible. And I just I'm praying
[1:01:13] and I I'm continuing to pray that God
[1:01:15] will give us more people in this church
[1:01:17] that have that revelation.
[1:01:22] That uh everything else does not matter
[1:01:25] when there is a service at church.
[1:01:29] You heard of a brother who his business
[1:01:31] is at a level whereby he meets
[1:01:33] presidents
[1:01:34] [Music]
[1:01:37] But one time the president was trying to
[1:01:39] make an appointment with him
[1:01:43] during service time.
[1:01:46] They told his office to tell them to
[1:01:48] tell the office of the president that he
[1:01:49] was too busy
[1:01:54] engaged with another in another meeting
[1:01:58] with God and he cannot turn down.
[1:02:02] I think that's a revelation.
[1:02:05] Amen. So what what is it that you you
[1:02:08] would be doing that would be so so so
[1:02:10] important more than being in charge?
[1:02:15] Try to always come to Jesus.
[1:02:18] Amen. As I'm studying, as I'm praying,
[1:02:20] as I'm waiting upon God, I'm thinking of
[1:02:22] you.
[1:02:27] When I come here and I see you,
[1:02:31] I feel good and I know then that God is
[1:02:34] going to feed you.
[1:02:37] You know, I see several mothers with us
[1:02:39] here tonight.
[1:02:41] Mothers that cook food and the family
[1:02:44] doesn't eat,
[1:02:48] the husband doesn't eat,
[1:02:50] the wife, the children don't eat,
[1:02:54] you know, the servants don't eat.
[1:02:57] You will feel so weird, so bad.
[1:03:01] You will feel as if you should never
[1:03:04] cook again.
[1:03:06] Is that amen? Mothers, sisters,
[1:03:09] what I'm trying to say, it's the same
[1:03:12] way with a preacher.
[1:03:14] You know when you know Jesus has a table
[1:03:16] spray
[1:03:18] and you know when when we say we have a
[1:03:21] service
[1:03:23] it means Jesus himself has prepared to
[1:03:26] feed us. So if you don't show up how do
[1:03:30] you think the Holy Spirit feels
[1:03:33] being that you've not come to your post
[1:03:35] of duty
[1:03:37] and and the food that has been served
[1:03:40] for you
[1:03:42] has not been given to you.
[1:03:44] It is so bad. It is so bad. Praise God.
[1:03:50] But when you come, it makes you happy.
[1:03:54] It makes the pastor happy. It makes God
[1:03:57] happy. And therefore, everybody's happy.
[1:04:01] So, how many are happy that are here
[1:04:02] this evening?
[1:04:04] God bless you. And those few words we
[1:04:07] are for those who are alive,
[1:04:10] not wanting to come to church.
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:16] those who are live on on
[1:04:20] Yeah. So, always make an effort to come.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; So, this evening I um I have a lot of u
[1:04:27] well the English people say I have a lot
[1:04:29] of hair on my fork
[1:04:32] [Music]
[1:04:34] where I have a lot to talk about
[1:04:37] and so I pray that you will stay with
[1:04:39] me.
[1:04:41] We usually have such a short time on
[1:04:42] Wednesday nights
[1:04:45] but and many of you come tired and all
[1:04:48] that but nonetheless how many are ready
[1:04:52] to hear from the
[1:04:55] Amen. So just open your heart relax.
[1:04:58] Tell your neighbor relax.
[1:05:01] Tell them relax.
[1:05:03] All right. So now we we just tie your
[1:05:06] seat belt.
[1:05:08] &gt;&gt; Let's get into the word. the narrow way.
[1:05:11] This is part four.
[1:05:13] And today you've noticed I've read that
[1:05:16] part of Matthew where he speaks about to
[1:05:19] uh being aware of false prophets.
[1:05:25] [Music]
[1:05:26] But also um in when you look at verses
[1:05:30] 13 to 14,
[1:05:33] it's what we we have been reading for
[1:05:34] three services now.
[1:05:37] Enter ye in at the straight gate, for
[1:05:39] wide is the gate, and broad is the way
[1:05:41] that leadth to destruction,
[1:05:43] and many there be which go in their art.
[1:05:48] Because straight is the gate,
[1:05:50] and narrow is the way,
[1:05:53] which leadth unto life,
[1:05:56] and few there be that find it.
[1:06:00] This service tonight is going to be a
[1:06:02] blessing to every believer
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; and for us to know really what we are
[1:06:09] expected of from the Lord
[1:06:12] and these kind of services the things
[1:06:14] I'm I'm talking about are really what
[1:06:16] would help us to mature
[1:06:20] so that we can be mature believers
[1:06:24] not young.
[1:06:26] It's just like if you're raising a child
[1:06:27] and the child is younger forever,
[1:06:33] it disheartens you.
[1:06:36] We want to feed on the word so we can
[1:06:39] know the principles of the word
[1:06:42] so we can mature in Christ.
[1:06:45] He's not coming for a younger church.
[1:06:48] He's coming for a grown church.
[1:06:51] He's coming for a church that is
[1:06:53] perfect.
[1:06:55] Perfection can only come by growth
[1:06:59] and growth can only come by the word
[1:07:02] not part word
[1:07:04] but full word. And on Sunday I spoke
[1:07:07] about this way of balam
[1:07:10] but I really just scratched the surface
[1:07:13] and I realized I need to get deeper with
[1:07:15] that.
[1:07:17] You know it has a lot even the way of
[1:07:20] Kane really much. But let let me just
[1:07:24] try to make a foundation and then now we
[1:07:26] quickly go into uh the subject for
[1:07:28] tonight.
[1:07:31] So now here he says that um uh straight
[1:07:34] is the gate and narrow is the way that
[1:07:36] leadth unto life.
[1:07:39] And now we are talking about the narrow
[1:07:41] way.
[1:07:43] And you see uh now he warns us of uh
[1:07:46] false prophets.
[1:07:49] But these false prophets do not come as
[1:07:51] false prophets.
[1:07:54] They come in sheep's clothing
[1:07:58] but inwardly they are ravening waters.
[1:08:01] So which means every preacher
[1:08:05] of the gospel
[1:08:07] could be
[1:08:09] a false prophet.
[1:08:13] So you can now see
[1:08:16] how important it is
[1:08:19] for you to really know
[1:08:23] the narrow way because if you do not
[1:08:25] know the narrow way, you will be
[1:08:28] deceived.
[1:08:30] The church is not going to be deceived
[1:08:32] by some rappers out there
[1:08:36] or by some, you know, devil worshippers
[1:08:40] or some, you know, people that are
[1:08:42] really way.
[1:08:44] You know the bride cannot be deceived by
[1:08:47] alcohol,
[1:08:49] the pride of life and things like that.
[1:08:52] We know it is wrong. We cannot even be
[1:08:55] deceived. Listen, listen, listen. We
[1:08:57] can't even even be deceived by the lust
[1:08:59] of the flesh.
[1:09:02] We cannot be deceived by it.
[1:09:04] We cannot be deceived by those things
[1:09:07] because we know it is wrong. We have a
[1:09:09] revelation
[1:09:11] of those of of those wrong things.
[1:09:14] and we cannot follow after them and we
[1:09:17] are fighting every day to overcome.
[1:09:21] Amen. But you see the the the devil is
[1:09:25] deceiving the church
[1:09:28] in a very unsuspecting way
[1:09:32] in a way that you would expect. That's
[1:09:34] why many people no longer want to go to
[1:09:36] church
[1:09:38] because they don't feel a reason to go
[1:09:40] to church.
[1:09:42] They feel most of the churches are
[1:09:43] liars.
[1:09:46] Most of the preachers are liars. And
[1:09:48] they are right.
[1:09:51] The false prophets are so many.
[1:09:54] And and the preachers who are preaching
[1:09:55] but they are not said by God are so many
[1:10:00] because the devil knew if I can capture
[1:10:03] the church, let me go in the name of
[1:10:06] their God.
[1:10:09] So he will always try to come and
[1:10:10] deceive
[1:10:13] but we are so delighted by one fact
[1:10:18] but the elect
[1:10:20] cannot be deceived. It is impossible for
[1:10:24] the elect to be deceived and I believe I
[1:10:27] am one of the elect. I cannot be
[1:10:29] deceived.
[1:10:31] That is the place where we get our
[1:10:32] consolation.
[1:10:35] Amen. that we cannot be deceived.
[1:10:38] We will not walk in the broad way. We
[1:10:42] will walk in the narrow way.
[1:10:44] But you see, it is like walking on a
[1:10:46] razor's edge.
[1:10:49] Because deception
[1:10:51] is not only in Roman Catholicism,
[1:10:55] deception is within
[1:10:59] the framework
[1:11:02] of the church.
[1:11:05] That's why the prophet say if the true
[1:11:08] church
[1:11:10] can be able to discern
[1:11:14] the false spirit the wrong spirit.
[1:11:17] Praise the name of the Lord. I read it
[1:11:20] for you last time
[1:11:22] that that is working within the
[1:11:24] framework of the Christian church.
[1:11:30] If we can be able to discern that
[1:11:36] Praise the name of the Lord. Let me let
[1:11:38] me just read that portion for you here
[1:11:41] and then now we can carry on after that.
[1:11:43] It is in the church age book somewhere.
[1:11:48] Praise God.
[1:11:53] Okay. Here right here it says
[1:11:59] this is just very interesting.
[1:12:01] It says now now it says um
[1:12:06] but the book of revelation shows how
[1:12:07] that the antichrist spirit is talking
[1:12:09] about the spirit which is against
[1:12:10] Christ.
[1:12:13] So this is the spirit we're talking
[1:12:14] about
[1:12:16] the antichrist spirit which is um the
[1:12:19] false the spirit of pro false prophets
[1:12:24] wrong teachers.
[1:12:27] Amen. He says that um um that he that
[1:12:31] the antichrist spirit would come into
[1:12:33] the church
[1:12:36] and defile it
[1:12:39] making it lukewarm
[1:12:41] for more powerless
[1:12:45] and um you know the book of revelation
[1:12:47] reveals Saturn's works
[1:12:54] you know which is
[1:12:56] attempted destruction ction of God's
[1:12:58] people
[1:13:02] and the discrediting of God's word.
[1:13:08] M
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; you see he says he knows
[1:13:14] Satan knows that if the people
[1:13:17] get the true revelation
[1:13:22] of the true church
[1:13:24] what she is what she stands for and that
[1:13:29] she can do the greater works
[1:13:32] she will be an invisible
[1:13:35] now now listen if they get a true
[1:13:37] revelation
[1:13:39] of the two spirits
[1:13:43] within.
[1:13:45] Where are those spirits? Both of them
[1:13:48] are within
[1:13:51] the framework of the Christian church.
[1:13:55] Where is
[1:13:59] within Rebecca?
[1:14:02] Where is Abel?
[1:14:04] Abel is within
[1:14:07] the woman Eve.
[1:14:11] Just like Cain is also within
[1:14:14] same womb
[1:14:16] two different seats, right from the
[1:14:19] beginning, we see Esau and Jacob fought
[1:14:24] beginning right in the womb.
[1:14:29] Right in the womb. They were fighting.
[1:14:32] They were born fighting.
[1:14:34] Praise God. What were they fighting for?
[1:14:38] They were fighting for the birth right.
[1:14:42] And the Bible says
[1:14:44] have I hated
[1:14:46] but Jacob have I love. So which means
[1:14:49] the elect was loved even before she was
[1:14:53] born.
[1:14:55] The love of God. How do you know it? You
[1:14:59] know the love of God by election.
[1:15:04] Amen. You know when Isa was born, Isa
[1:15:09] was loved by the father.
[1:15:12] And remember the father of Esau, his
[1:15:15] name is Isaac. Isaac was a seed of
[1:15:17] Abraham.
[1:15:19] Isaac was a son of God. But Isaac could
[1:15:23] not, I don't know why, but he could not
[1:15:25] discern
[1:15:27] the city that was in in in Esau.
[1:15:32] And and yet, brother Bam said that he
[1:15:34] was a prophet.
[1:15:37] But he loved Esau
[1:15:40] more than you know Jacob. Can you
[1:15:44] imagine what kind of love was that? That
[1:15:47] was human love.
[1:15:50] Not God is love. That was the love of
[1:15:52] Isaac.
[1:15:55] So Isa looked like he was favored.
[1:15:59] We had the birthight.
[1:16:02] The father wanted to give him all the
[1:16:03] blessing.
[1:16:05] But you know what? The elect cannot be
[1:16:07] deceived.
[1:16:10] Amen. You know, no one can take away the
[1:16:13] blessing from Jacob because Jacob was
[1:16:18] loved by God. The love of God is not
[1:16:21] tested.
[1:16:23] It's not tested by how much you have.
[1:16:27] The love of God is not known by how much
[1:16:30] money you have.
[1:16:32] You may be the poorest of the poor.
[1:16:35] You may have nothing in this life. But
[1:16:37] my brother, if God loves you,
[1:16:40] That shows he elected you.
[1:16:43] His love is manifested
[1:16:46] through election.
[1:16:49] Amen. When did he elect us? The Bible
[1:16:51] says he chose us in him
[1:16:55] before the foundation of the world.
[1:16:58] Amen. We are here manifested here. We
[1:17:02] conform of God into the image of his
[1:17:06] son. The devil cannot stop that
[1:17:10] because it is by design.
[1:17:13] It is by divine blood.
[1:17:16] It is by divine foreign.
[1:17:20] He knew us when he chose us in him. We
[1:17:25] were a part of his character.
[1:17:28] But you see these two seeds are always
[1:17:32] together in the same church in the same
[1:17:35] womb. Praise God.
[1:17:39] But a shark will not be here
[1:17:43] with a sin.
[1:17:46] Hallelujah. Just like you see yourself,
[1:17:49] you have body soul spirit.
[1:17:52] Real believer, make believe unbeliever.
[1:17:56] But you know what? The shark will never
[1:17:59] be here with a seed.
[1:18:02] Amen. You, the real you will put on your
[1:18:07] real funny body
[1:18:12] and you will drop this nonbeliever body.
[1:18:17] This body which will never be saved.
[1:18:20] This body which is so lustful,
[1:18:22] this body which has made you suffer.
[1:18:26] One of this morning we will fly away.
[1:18:29] Hallelujah. We will drop this bodies.
[1:18:32] He will overcome for sure. It is a
[1:18:35] living reality.
[1:18:38] Whether the body believes it or not, it
[1:18:41] will not stay with me forever.
[1:18:43] I have another body.
[1:18:47] Praise God.
[1:18:49] You see now he says if the church will
[1:18:52] get the true revelation
[1:18:54] of the two spirits
[1:18:57] within
[1:18:59] the framework of the Christian church.
[1:19:03] within the message,
[1:19:07] within our churches,
[1:19:09] those seeds are there.
[1:19:12] If they were in Paul's church,
[1:19:17] they were they will be in Brham's
[1:19:18] church.
[1:19:21] Are you are you following? Because those
[1:19:23] two seed we see them starting right out
[1:19:27] in the beginning
[1:19:29] in the Ephesian church.
[1:19:32] They were right there made manif. But
[1:19:35] you know what the master said?
[1:19:37] He said do not uproot the wrong seed.
[1:19:42] Leave it until when
[1:19:46] the end
[1:19:48] until the time of the end.
[1:19:50] What is that time? The time of the
[1:19:52] harvest.
[1:19:54] Amen. He said when the when he comes he
[1:19:57] he will separate
[1:19:59] the right seed
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; from the wrong seed.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other one he will take
[1:20:05] into the garden
[1:20:07] and the other one he will burn it. And
[1:20:09] you know that time is now.
[1:20:13] This is harvest time.
[1:20:16] God is amen is doing a final work
[1:20:20] calling his final seed.
[1:20:23] out of the husk
[1:20:26] of denominationalism
[1:20:28] of religion
[1:20:30] of traditions of men into Christ
[1:20:34] because said it has been revealed to me
[1:20:38] the place where you should gather.
[1:20:40] Amen. Why should we gather? Because it
[1:20:43] is a time of harvest.
[1:20:46] Because it is harvest time. You can only
[1:20:48] a you can only gather the grain.
[1:20:52] during harvest time.
[1:20:55] This is harvest time.
[1:20:57] Amen. And he said, "Has been revealed to
[1:20:59] me where we should gather, where you
[1:21:03] should gather, not in Jefferson. It's
[1:21:06] not in Texas. It's not anywhere. It is
[1:21:09] in Christ."
[1:21:12] Amen. Amen. So the bride is being
[1:21:15] gathered in Christ.
[1:21:18] That's why you must be born again.
[1:21:21] you must be filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:21:25] Amen. Because that's the place where you
[1:21:28] are. You must be found.
[1:21:31] Praise God.
[1:21:33] Amen. And now we see here that you see
[1:21:36] these two seeds, these two spirits in
[1:21:40] the framework of the Christian church.
[1:21:43] But you see these two church
[1:21:46] by God spirit.
[1:21:49] this true church
[1:21:51] by God's spirit
[1:21:53] if it can discern
[1:21:57] and withand
[1:22:00] the antichrist spirit
[1:22:04] Jacob designed and withtood.
[1:22:08] But you see one thing that gave Jacob
[1:22:10] grace
[1:22:12] to overcome
[1:22:14] was the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:22:19] Amen.
[1:22:21] By by God's spirit design and withstand
[1:22:23] the antichrist spirit.
[1:22:27] Satan will be powerless before her.
[1:22:35] Amen.
[1:22:36] Amen.
[1:22:38] Amen. If God can give us the grace
[1:22:42] to discern the wrong spirit
[1:22:44] and to overcome it, to reject it, to
[1:22:48] withand it then Satan will be powerless
[1:22:55] before us
[1:22:57] because we are the church triumphant. We
[1:23:00] are the savior's bride. We are the
[1:23:03] witness. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to
[1:23:07] God. Hallelujah.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; We are the original seed
[1:23:10] which was planted in the beginning.
[1:23:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. So now you see why we need
[1:23:16] to talk about this narrow way.
[1:23:19] Because the narrow way can only be
[1:23:22] walked on those
[1:23:26] who have discerned
[1:23:28] and withtood
[1:23:30] the antichrist spirit.
[1:23:33] Praise God.
[1:23:35] Amen. And so Jude wonders
[1:23:39] in verse 11. He says, "Why are to them
[1:23:43] the false prophets?" You know, for they
[1:23:45] have gone in the way of Cain,
[1:23:48] and they ran greedly after the error of
[1:23:50] of of Bam
[1:23:56] and perished.
[1:23:58] And this is the part we're going to talk
[1:23:59] about today.
[1:24:01] And perished
[1:24:03] in the gain saying of Kora.
[1:24:09] That's the last part of verse 11.
[1:24:17] Yeah. Now, three things we looked at.
[1:24:21] Praise God. Amen. How Jude was warning
[1:24:25] us of of of these false preachers
[1:24:29] of this antichrist spirit.
[1:24:32] How he was warning us, how he was
[1:24:34] helping us to discern it so we can
[1:24:38] withstand it.
[1:24:40] And he gave us three examples. Oh,
[1:24:43] hallelujah. In the Old Testament, he
[1:24:45] said, "What? How can you know them?" We
[1:24:48] know he has said already in Matthew,
[1:24:51] "You shall know them by their fruits."
[1:24:54] So now we can see the fruits of Cain.
[1:24:58] We now know who he is. We have known his
[1:25:01] serpent seed.
[1:25:03] He tried to worship without revelation
[1:25:07] and amen. People died.
[1:25:10] The spirits don't die. The spirit of
[1:25:13] Cain is alive to die.
[1:25:17] People who will try to serve God
[1:25:19] by the way of religion but not by
[1:25:22] revelation.
[1:25:24] You know they walking in the way of
[1:25:26] care.
[1:25:28] Amen. And when the word of God comes,
[1:25:30] they don't have revelation. Nothing in
[1:25:33] their heart to reveal it to them. But
[1:25:36] the bride of Christ has revelation.
[1:25:40] Revelation
[1:25:41] sets you apart from everybody else.
[1:25:46] And we found that faith is revelation.
[1:25:50] If you want to please God,
[1:25:53] you must have faith.
[1:25:55] Without faith, it is impossible to
[1:25:58] please God. And therefore, because we
[1:26:00] have faith,
[1:26:03] Amen. We are pleasing God.
[1:26:05] Amen. Hallelujah. Right now I can say,
[1:26:09] well, praise God. I see a group of
[1:26:11] people that are walking by faith and not
[1:26:15] by sight. Amen. Who are they? They are
[1:26:18] the bride of God. They are all over the
[1:26:21] world. Walking by faith and not by
[1:26:25] sight. Why? Because we have received the
[1:26:29] revelation of the word of God for our
[1:26:33] generation.
[1:26:35] We are walking by faith. We are walking
[1:26:38] by faith. Like Enoch, one of these days
[1:26:42] we will walk and the word will see us no
[1:26:45] longer.
[1:26:46] Hallelujah.
[1:26:48] Why? We are walking by faith and not by
[1:26:51] sight. We are not going in the way of
[1:26:54] Cain.
[1:26:55] We are going in the way of sin, in the
[1:26:58] way of Adam, in the way of Adam, the
[1:27:01] second Adam.
[1:27:03] Praise God.
[1:27:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. And we we notice he warned us also
[1:27:08] of the error of Balum
[1:27:12] who was uh just running after reward.
[1:27:16] You know, and we notice the spirit of
[1:27:18] Balum works in two ways. Fornication,
[1:27:23] idolatry. And you see fornication we
[1:27:26] talked about brother was telling us that
[1:27:27] you see the spirit of fornication
[1:27:30] is is is the same same spirit
[1:27:35] of diluting the word
[1:27:39] and rejecting the truth and believing
[1:27:42] false teachings
[1:27:45] doctrines of men
[1:27:47] traditions of men instead of the word.
[1:27:51] And he said all those religions that
[1:27:53] have rejected the word are fornicating
[1:27:56] spiritually.
[1:28:01] We we read about on Sunday about the
[1:28:03] woman
[1:28:05] who the Bible says was uh you know uh
[1:28:08] having a cup
[1:28:10] filled with the wine of her fornication.
[1:28:14] And we saw that the wine of our
[1:28:16] fornication
[1:28:18] pointing to doctrines and teachings and
[1:28:20] ideas and traditions
[1:28:26] that men have received of her.
[1:28:31] The Bible would even say she she has
[1:28:33] made the kings of the world to drink of
[1:28:37] the wine of the cup.
[1:28:40] And you know you see that that's the
[1:28:42] biggest religion in the world.
[1:28:46] The richest of it all you know you know
[1:28:49] decked with the gold and pearls and
[1:28:51] precious stones.
[1:28:53] It is the richest church all over the
[1:28:55] world
[1:28:56] you know but it has false teachings
[1:28:59] of the trinity of worship through people
[1:29:02] and scapulars and and all things to
[1:29:06] replace Christ.
[1:29:10] And you know they are the mother a lot.
[1:29:15] She's the mother of all of them.
[1:29:18] And because she's a mother, we saw she
[1:29:21] has daughters.
[1:29:23] And those daughters as fornicators just
[1:29:26] like her.
[1:29:28] Why? Because they are receiving the wine
[1:29:30] and they drinking the wine. They have
[1:29:33] received the false teachings, the false
[1:29:35] ideas, the false traditions and they
[1:29:38] have drunk it. And because of that they
[1:29:42] are also uh fornicators.
[1:29:45] The Bible called her the mother hall
[1:29:48] and they are the positive daughters.
[1:29:51] Who is the mother hall? The Roman
[1:29:54] Catholic religion.
[1:29:59] Who are the who are the daughters? The
[1:30:01] Protestant denominations.
[1:30:08] That's Bible prophecy for you.
[1:30:12] And who are we? We are none of them.
[1:30:17] That is why we are not a denomination.
[1:30:21] We cannot be a denomination.
[1:30:24] We are only the bride of the world.
[1:30:28] We feed on nothing but the word.
[1:30:31] We don't feed on a man's ideas but the
[1:30:33] word.
[1:30:35] We don't feed on traditions of men but
[1:30:37] the word.
[1:30:39] We don't feed on following men but the
[1:30:41] word.
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; We are the bride of the one.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the one that is spoken of
[1:30:48] in Revelation 19.
[1:30:52] Amen. Glory to God. What does he say?
[1:30:56] She says the marriage of the lamb is
[1:30:58] come
[1:31:00] and his bride has made us separate.
[1:31:05] Amen. Amen.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We are his bride
[1:31:10] and we are ready. We are ready. I said
[1:31:14] we are ready.
[1:31:16] What? What made us ready? We are made
[1:31:18] ready by the word.
[1:31:21] Amen. And that's the third pool ministry
[1:31:26] of the prophet. You see the opening of
[1:31:29] the word.
[1:31:30] You see what it does? It makes the bride
[1:31:33] ready.
[1:31:36] Amen. For the word of God is good.
[1:31:40] Amen. And for what is given the Bible
[1:31:44] says by the every word of God is given
[1:31:47] by inspiration.
[1:31:50] every scripture by inspiration
[1:31:53] so that it can accomplish work that
[1:31:55] every man of God may be perfect,
[1:32:00] [Music]
[1:32:01] furnished
[1:32:03] unto all good works.
[1:32:07] The word of God is here to make us
[1:32:11] perfect.
[1:32:13] Amen. You're not going to become perfect
[1:32:15] by your works.
[1:32:17] You're going to become perfect by the
[1:32:18] word.
[1:32:21] Amen. Are you hearing me church? Now we
[1:32:24] see that the spirit of the era of Balam
[1:32:27] for made the people go into fornication
[1:32:30] is a spirit of religion.
[1:32:33] And the Bible says all the fornicators
[1:32:35] have their place in the lake of fire.
[1:32:38] The lake of fire
[1:32:41] both the spiritual fornicators and the
[1:32:44] physical fornicators.
[1:32:45] [Music]
[1:32:47] That is why There is nothing in the
[1:32:50] Bible that I know of
[1:32:53] that tells us to separate with anybody
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] apart from the one who is fornicating.
[1:33:03] Why? Because fornication
[1:33:06] is to God the worst of his kind.
[1:33:14] It takes away your spiritual virginity.
[1:33:20] It takes away your your your the way you
[1:33:23] look at yourself and the way you look at
[1:33:25] the world
[1:33:28] and then you become an object of lust.
[1:33:33] And that's why said Hollywood has made a
[1:33:35] woman a sex garbage kind.
[1:33:41] And with all the movies they act,
[1:33:44] you know, the way they present the
[1:33:45] woman,
[1:33:47] the way she's dressed,
[1:33:49] the way, you know, they present her is
[1:33:52] all in a filthy way
[1:33:55] that she's just there to be used.
[1:33:58] But you see that's not how God has
[1:34:00] intended for what God has intended for a
[1:34:03] woman.
[1:34:06] And he proved it when he came to Mary
[1:34:10] and he said, "You are chosen among all
[1:34:11] women, blessed among all women." Amen.
[1:34:14] When he got himself
[1:34:16] came into the world by a woman, he
[1:34:20] proved it that this is what a woman was
[1:34:24] supposed to do to bring forth Christ.
[1:34:29] And that's why there is another bride,
[1:34:32] the women of Adam who cannot fall. Why?
[1:34:37] Because she is predestined
[1:34:40] to bring forth Christ.
[1:34:43] We have a womb also, the spiritual womb.
[1:34:47] When we receive the word, the seed, the
[1:34:50] word is a seed,
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; the original seed. When we receive it in
[1:34:54] our heart, we cannot bring forth any
[1:34:57] other.
[1:34:59] We cannot bring forth an
[1:35:06] only for Christ, the second Adam who
[1:35:11] cannot die.
[1:35:13] who is like God in the image and
[1:35:15] likeness of
[1:35:18] praise God.
[1:35:20] So Balum the era of Balam
[1:35:23] will take people into denominations
[1:35:27] which is spiritual fornication
[1:35:29] and and you know idolatry
[1:35:31] which is worshiping other gods
[1:35:34] by the God of Israel
[1:35:36] and there's much I said we can talk
[1:35:38] about that but tonight I want to talk
[1:35:40] about again sayings of God
[1:35:44] and you see that um now that Jude was
[1:35:47] warning the believers
[1:35:49] not to Go in the gain sayings of Kora.
[1:35:55] Who is Kora?
[1:35:58] Amen. Represents rebellion against God's
[1:36:01] chosen leadership.
[1:36:07] So now false prophets who are lying and
[1:36:11] liars
[1:36:12] don't come only in false worship
[1:36:16] without revelation. They not only come
[1:36:19] with false teachings,
[1:36:21] they not come only with fornications and
[1:36:23] idolatry,
[1:36:24] but they also come in ways of rejecting
[1:36:29] God's chosen leadership.
[1:36:36] That's the way of Kora
[1:36:39] sayings of Kora.
[1:36:41] He challenged Moses and
[1:36:44] saying we are holy too and he was
[1:36:47] destroyed.
[1:36:49] Those who walk in corous rebellion
[1:36:51] resist God is order.
[1:36:59] They reject God's order and authority
[1:37:04] in the church. Did you know God has his
[1:37:08] own order?
[1:37:12] his own authority.
[1:37:14] The way he wants the church to be ruled,
[1:37:18] the way he wants God has a way that he
[1:37:21] wants his people to be led.
[1:37:26] And the way God leads his people
[1:37:29] has never changed from the beginning to
[1:37:32] the end. How does he does he do it? He
[1:37:36] sends a man.
[1:37:38] And when he sent that man, we have
[1:37:41] always seen that man will never be the
[1:37:43] best.
[1:37:45] He either send somebody who is young
[1:37:48] or he sent someone who is downcast
[1:37:53] or he send someone who is not educated
[1:37:56] or he send someone who doesn't know how
[1:37:57] to talk
[1:37:59] or he send someone who is insufficient
[1:38:02] or he send someone who people think is a
[1:38:04] sinner.
[1:38:06] That's somebody who, you know, is out of
[1:38:09] the ordinary.
[1:38:13] Why? Because when God chooses a man, he
[1:38:17] wants to be the preeminent one.
[1:38:21] Because God does not share his glory
[1:38:24] with anyone. So when God chooses a man,
[1:38:28] he has already looked at him and he has
[1:38:31] trained him and he has taken him through
[1:38:33] a process and he has already known his
[1:38:37] end
[1:38:38] right from the beginning and then he
[1:38:40] chooses him and then he says, "Oh, I
[1:38:43] want to use you."
[1:38:45] So now when anyone comes and goes
[1:38:48] against God's choice
[1:38:51] as the spirit of the antichrist,
[1:38:56] It's like saying that God never chose
[1:38:58] right.
[1:39:01] God chose a Moses. A man who was
[1:39:03] educated, a man who knew how to fight, a
[1:39:07] man who knew how to speak, a man who
[1:39:09] knew everything. Listen to me, church.
[1:39:12] But Moses reached a time when he thought
[1:39:15] he could do it on his own. And the whole
[1:39:17] time, God was not with him.
[1:39:22] God wasn't with him. And then you know
[1:39:24] he killed a man and because he did it
[1:39:28] without God is involved.
[1:39:30] God told him sort it on your own.
[1:39:34] But whole time his eye God's eye was on
[1:39:38] Moses. I want to tell you tonight God's
[1:39:42] eye is always on his chosen one. God is
[1:39:46] eye is always on the spiral. If God
[1:39:49] chose you for any work, no matter your
[1:39:52] failures, he's watching you. He's
[1:39:56] waiting for a time for a moment when you
[1:40:00] will yield yourself.
[1:40:03] Then he can now say, "Let us begin the
[1:40:06] work."
[1:40:07] And then Moses after 40 good years you
[1:40:11] know he failed everything but he is now
[1:40:14] a little shepherd very old 80 years old
[1:40:18] he thought I can do nothing good anymore
[1:40:22] now God said it is now time for me to
[1:40:26] call my man
[1:40:28] Amen I called him I chose him I ordained
[1:40:32] him before he was
[1:40:36] But he wasn't ready yet. But
[1:40:40] [Music]
[1:40:41] now that he feels insufficient,
[1:40:44] it is the time for me to now send him
[1:40:48] out.
[1:40:50] Oh, praise God. And then God comes down
[1:40:53] to old Moses and he tells him, Moses,
[1:40:56] it's now time.
[1:40:59] It's now time. Let me tell you brother,
[1:41:02] Moses killed people when he was working
[1:41:05] in his own ability.
[1:41:08] You may be called by God. You may be you
[1:41:10] may you may be you know sanctioned to
[1:41:13] serve God.
[1:41:15] But if you hurt people
[1:41:17] in the process of ministry,
[1:41:20] it's not your time yet.
[1:41:22] It's not God's hand on you.
[1:41:25] God can never lay his hand on a man.
[1:41:30] for him to hurt other men.
[1:41:33] Ministry is fragile.
[1:41:37] The work of God is very fragile because
[1:41:41] we are dealing with souls.
[1:41:44] And he wants his souls, his people, the
[1:41:48] words he possess with his blood
[1:41:51] to be taken so important.
[1:41:55] It is not the servant who is important.
[1:41:58] It is the people, the soul that are
[1:42:00] important. And a shepherd must be a man
[1:42:04] of the people. A man that David would
[1:42:07] talk about. And I and he would say in
[1:42:10] Psalms 23
[1:42:12] and talk about the shepherd and talk
[1:42:14] about the shepherd say he leadth me to
[1:42:18] green pastures.
[1:42:20] And in the New Testament, Jesus came and
[1:42:24] he said, "I am the good shepherd."
[1:42:28] And when he sends a man to shepherd the
[1:42:31] people, he has already trained him.
[1:42:35] But if a man begins hurting people
[1:42:39] in the lion ministry, in the days of
[1:42:42] ministry,
[1:42:44] it shows it's not the time for his
[1:42:46] ministry.
[1:42:50] And when the time was right for Moses,
[1:42:53] Moses thought he could not do anything.
[1:42:56] That's why every God called minister
[1:42:58] must never feel sufficient in himself.
[1:43:04] He must never feel sufficient in
[1:43:06] himself.
[1:43:08] He must know I can do nothing of myself.
[1:43:12] That's even how Jesus felt when he was
[1:43:15] on earth. He said I do nothing except
[1:43:20] the father shows me
[1:43:23] without him I am nothing. That's God
[1:43:28] found in a fashion as a man.
[1:43:33] So friends when Moses came to that place
[1:43:36] of vulnerability
[1:43:38] human frailty
[1:43:39] then our God said it's time to go
[1:43:43] and he sent him and Moses said I'm not
[1:43:45] able.
[1:43:46] Don't you worry, I'm with you. Go.
[1:43:49] Now, Moses went after many years of God
[1:43:53] dealing with Israel. You you remember
[1:43:55] how Moses was dealing with the people?
[1:43:58] You know, of course, Moses had his own
[1:44:00] uh you know, his own issues
[1:44:03] and there was a time that he called the
[1:44:06] people rebels
[1:44:08] and it struck the rock twice
[1:44:11] because he had a weakness of anger.
[1:44:14] He had to pay for it by not going to the
[1:44:17] promised land.
[1:44:20] Every minister, whatever you do, there
[1:44:23] is accountability.
[1:44:28] And we see that Moses as he was called
[1:44:31] by God and he went
[1:44:33] and you know God, you know, with the
[1:44:34] pill of fire, God was really with them.
[1:44:37] God was helping him. But then there came
[1:44:39] a time when there was a man, a brother,
[1:44:44] a minister, who also thought he was as
[1:44:47] anointed as Moses did.
[1:44:51] He was as cold as Moses was. And he
[1:44:54] could do it just like Moses did. That
[1:44:56] was the big mistake
[1:44:59] that Kora did. Where was he when God was
[1:45:03] sending Moses?
[1:45:09] Did God know Torah would be born? Why
[1:45:12] didn't he wait for him? Why did he wait
[1:45:15] for Moses for 40 years?
[1:45:18] Because he was
[1:45:20] he had sanctioned
[1:45:22] that Moses would be the man.
[1:45:27] Not every one of us
[1:45:30] will be used the same way
[1:45:33] to serve God. Each of you have your own
[1:45:37] calling.
[1:45:39] Find your calling.
[1:45:41] Make it sure. The Bible says, "Make your
[1:45:44] calling and election." Sure.
[1:45:47] You have it.
[1:45:50] Now in the book of numbers 161
[1:45:55] now Kora the son of Isah the son of Kth
[1:45:57] the son of Levi and Dan and Abberam the
[1:46:00] sons of Elab and on the son of Paleth
[1:46:04] the sons of Rub and took men and they
[1:46:07] rose up before Moses with certain of the
[1:46:10] children of Israel. You see now here is
[1:46:12] Moses. You will not read in Uganda. is
[1:46:14] Moses.
[1:46:16] You know, you know, Moses is just, you
[1:46:18] know, doing the work that he's called to
[1:46:19] do. He's minding his ministry. He's
[1:46:23] calling. Oh, I wish saints we had time
[1:46:26] to go through this tonight.
[1:46:29] I have only, you know, um 12 minutes,
[1:46:31] but tonight I'm going to go a little bit
[1:46:33] a little over the time. Listen, just
[1:46:36] just listen to me tonight. And here was
[1:46:39] uh this gentleman Kora, Isa, Kath and
[1:46:44] you know Dathan rather Abraham you know
[1:46:46] these men rose up
[1:46:49] and they connived among themselves and
[1:46:52] they rose up before Moses. They came not
[1:46:55] alone but they had managed to uh you
[1:46:59] know convince a section of the church
[1:47:04] and 250
[1:47:06] princes of the assembly.
[1:47:09] [Music]
[1:47:12] Not common brethren,
[1:47:17] not the poor,
[1:47:20] but those ones that were famous in the
[1:47:24] church,
[1:47:27] those ones who were paying the biggest
[1:47:29] t.
[1:47:31] Those ones who were the richest,
[1:47:34] those ones who were the renown,
[1:47:37] read it in your Bible,
[1:47:39] those are the ones they convinced.
[1:47:42] Vers three. Amen. And they gathered
[1:47:45] themselves together. I don't have time
[1:47:47] to go into the nitty-g gritties. Just
[1:47:49] follow me closely.
[1:47:51] And they gathered themselves together
[1:47:52] against Moses and against Aaron and said
[1:47:56] unto them, "Ye too much upon you, seeing
[1:48:02] all the congregation are holy."
[1:48:06] Just interpret it, brother. You take so
[1:48:08] much upon you because all the church is
[1:48:10] holy.
[1:48:19] You are doing too much work.
[1:48:21] You are the one doing this.
[1:48:25] Everyone in the church is holy.
[1:48:28] Everyone in the church is is called
[1:48:30] everyone. But they failed to understand
[1:48:34] that the calling was different.
[1:48:37] The measure was different.
[1:48:39] The anointing was different.
[1:48:42] The anointing on your pastor is not the
[1:48:44] anointing on you.
[1:48:47] The anointing on your father is not the
[1:48:48] same the one like the one you have.
[1:48:52] Are you hearing me, my sister? Your
[1:48:55] mother's anointing is not the same like
[1:48:57] yours.
[1:48:59] Every one of us is given a measure.
[1:49:02] A measure. Oh my, I wish I had time.
[1:49:06] Listen, ye take too much upon you,
[1:49:09] seeing all the congregation are holy,
[1:49:12] every one of them, and the Lord is among
[1:49:13] them.
[1:49:15] Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
[1:49:17] upon the congregation of the Lord.
[1:49:21] Moses
[1:49:23] with all these people of yours, why are
[1:49:25] you lifting yourself up and making
[1:49:28] yourself like a lord, a dictator?
[1:49:33] They had points The points were valid
[1:49:38] politically speaking.
[1:49:43] But God is not a politician.
[1:49:48] The Bible says God is a righteous
[1:49:51] church.
[1:49:54] And he
[1:49:56] is the suffering.
[1:50:00] Did you know God is not a democrat?
[1:50:07] No, God is not democrat
[1:50:11] is neither Republican.
[1:50:15] God Oh my, I wish I had time cuz I'm
[1:50:19] hearing many revelation.
[1:50:21] How does God operate?
[1:50:24] God is a theocrat.
[1:50:28] God is a king.
[1:50:30] He believes in autocracy.
[1:50:33] He believes in dictating.
[1:50:36] You don't have to agree with him.
[1:50:39] You just have to accept what he wants
[1:50:41] you to say to believe.
[1:50:43] And how does he do that? That's why he
[1:50:46] sends a prophet.
[1:50:48] A prophet doesn't come to debate.
[1:50:52] A prophet doesn't come to seek for your
[1:50:54] opinion.
[1:50:56] A prophet doesn't come to seek for your
[1:50:59] agreement.
[1:51:01] A prophet comes to tell you, "Thus
[1:51:02] sayeth the Lord,
[1:51:06] follow or die."
[1:51:09] And all men of God,
[1:51:11] God sent
[1:51:13] that say the Lord.
[1:51:16] And in a generation, God sends one major
[1:51:19] prophet with thus say the Lord. But
[1:51:22] another local assembly,
[1:51:24] God raises a little man,
[1:51:28] a little prophet who love thus say the
[1:51:31] Lord for that local church.
[1:51:36] But even then not everyone is going to
[1:51:38] be a pastor. Others are called as
[1:51:41] apostles,
[1:51:45] others evangelists, others teachers.
[1:51:48] Oh my friends, I have no time.
[1:51:51] But just follow me closely. I'll take it
[1:51:54] until until you cannot receive it
[1:51:56] anymore. Listen,
[1:51:58] vers four.
[1:52:00] And when Moses heard it, when Moses, a
[1:52:03] man called by God,
[1:52:06] when he heard what they say,
[1:52:09] he fell upon his face.
[1:52:14] Brother, sister,
[1:52:16] never do anything
[1:52:19] to a man of God which will make him fall
[1:52:22] on his face
[1:52:25] because of you.
[1:52:27] That man of God doesn't have to be your
[1:52:29] pastor.
[1:52:31] It can be any man who is called by God.
[1:52:34] Be very careful
[1:52:36] when a man of God anointed by the spirit
[1:52:39] of God falls down on his face
[1:52:42] because of you.
[1:52:46] Bad news.
[1:52:49] Moses fell upon his face. Vers five. And
[1:52:52] he spake unto Kora and unto all his
[1:52:55] company, saying, "Even tomorrow,
[1:52:59] the Lord
[1:53:02] will show who I is and who is holy, and
[1:53:06] will cause him to come near unto him.
[1:53:09] And even him whom he has chosen will he
[1:53:13] cause to come near unto him.
[1:53:19] Listen
[1:53:28] church.
[1:53:30] When a man is called by God,
[1:53:34] God has tested him.
[1:53:36] God has known this man has no ability.
[1:53:41] This man has no helper.
[1:53:44] Just like David saying, I looked onto
[1:53:46] the hill, from where cometh my help, my
[1:53:51] help cometh from the Lord. So when you
[1:53:53] fight against that man,
[1:53:56] you are fighting against his help
[1:54:00] immediately Moses.
[1:54:06] Let's go to God and let God show
[1:54:11] who is his man
[1:54:13] who is God
[1:54:18] thought
[1:54:20] it is a joking matter.
[1:54:23] He did not know who placed Moses there.
[1:54:28] Brother, when you were not there,
[1:54:31] sister, when you were not there, when
[1:54:33] God was calling that man,
[1:54:37] you better not say anything.
[1:54:41] Our prophet told us, you know what? If
[1:54:44] you you you don't understand something
[1:54:47] that a man of God does, stay away from
[1:54:50] it. Say nothing about it. say nothing
[1:54:54] against you lest you be found to be
[1:54:57] fighting against God.
[1:55:03] Praise God. Vers 28.
[1:55:07] And Moses said, "Hereby ye shall know
[1:55:10] that the Lord has sent me to do all
[1:55:13] these works, for I have not done them of
[1:55:16] my own hand.
[1:55:27] If these men die,
[1:55:30] the common death of all men or if they
[1:55:33] be visited after their the visation of
[1:55:35] all men,
[1:55:38] then the Lord has not sent me.
[1:55:43] Those are not just blessings.
[1:55:47] Those are words from a man of God's
[1:55:49] mouth.
[1:55:52] Fear man of God.
[1:55:55] Pastor, are you trying to scare us? No.
[1:55:58] I am giving you a principle
[1:56:01] which will go a long way in helping you.
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; Oh, Mr. Church. I have seen a lot of
[1:56:08] young people who have no record
[1:56:13] for the ministry
[1:56:15] all over WhatsApp.
[1:56:18] &gt;&gt; They'll speak this, they'll speak that.
[1:56:20] They will confront men of God.
[1:56:24] We here at DBF
[1:56:26] should know better.
[1:56:31] And here a man says, if these men die a
[1:56:33] natural death,
[1:56:37] then God never sent me.
[1:56:42] In other words, he declared their death.
[1:56:46] He announced their death. Vers.
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; But if the Lord make a new thing,
[1:56:55] and the earth open her mouth,
[1:56:58] and swallow them up
[1:57:02] with all that pertainth unto them,
[1:57:06] and they go down quick into the pit,
[1:57:09] then he shall understand
[1:57:13] that these men have provoked the Lord.
[1:57:16] [Applause]
[1:57:18] They provoked who
[1:57:21] not Moses?
[1:57:23] But they talked about Moses.
[1:57:27] By fighting against a man called by God,
[1:57:31] you are provoking the Lord.
[1:57:34] By speaking one negative word about a
[1:57:36] servant of God,
[1:57:40] you are provoking the Lord.
[1:57:44] Pastor, even when I've done something
[1:57:45] wrong.
[1:57:46] Yes. Shut up.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to if I have time, I'll
[1:57:52] show you. This is biblical.
[1:57:55] One of their reasons was that Moses
[1:57:57] married an unbeliever.
[1:58:00] He married an Ethiopian woman. And they
[1:58:03] were right.
[1:58:06] But they had to shut up because they did
[1:58:09] not
[1:58:11] call Moses.
[1:58:14] That weakness that Moses had
[1:58:17] kept him humble
[1:58:19] and God knew it. That's why he called
[1:58:22] you to begin with.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; Now,
[1:58:32] praise God.
[1:58:35] I have a lot to give you, but let's just
[1:58:37] take it to for 20 more minutes. Now,
[1:58:38] listen here.
[1:58:40] Let me give you another example.
[1:58:44] Before we go into the example, there's a
[1:58:46] quote I wanted to read from the spoken
[1:58:47] word is the original scene.
[1:58:52] So just follow me as I read it quickly.
[1:58:56] How different today many so-called
[1:58:57] evangelists claim they have the answer
[1:58:59] from God
[1:59:02] for the people just as Kora did denying
[1:59:07] disputing the authority of God is
[1:59:09] vindicated anointed prophet Moses
[1:59:12] claiming he had the answer
[1:59:20] vindicated anointed
[1:59:24] he denied and disputed
[1:59:27] This was a money-m scheme,
[1:59:31] a golden calf
[1:59:33] as many do today. Big buildings, big
[1:59:35] schools incubator
[1:59:38] and they bring forth the same seed
[1:59:40] and the people then as like now fell for
[1:59:42] it.
[1:59:44] And even today many people have fell for
[1:59:46] those people who are speaking against
[1:59:52] they don't know what they're doing.
[1:59:54] digging their own graves,
[1:59:56] spiritual graves after many many things
[1:59:59] brother Bham said that I may not
[2:00:01] understand
[2:00:04] but he's a man of God.
[2:00:08] Brother, what do you think about this?
[2:00:11] And your question is to ridicule the
[2:00:12] prophet
[2:00:14] question.
[2:00:17] I'll not even give you an answer. I have
[2:00:19] no time for nonsense.
[2:00:26] What do you think about our pastor?
[2:00:28] You know, he does it.
[2:00:32] I have no time for that.
[2:00:35] And then the people as like now they
[2:00:37] fell for it.
[2:00:39] If they had heard had a true word of God
[2:00:42] through an anointed prophet
[2:00:46] that was vindicated
[2:00:48] but they didn't. They fell for Kora's
[2:00:51] lie.
[2:00:55] God proven God proven prophet and God
[2:00:58] knew
[2:01:02] and he knew God had told them. Israel
[2:01:04] knew God had told them distinctly that
[2:01:06] he would even vindicate his prophets by
[2:01:08] his word. Kora was not a spiritual pro a
[2:01:10] scriptural prophet but it looked awful
[2:01:12] good to the people. Same as it does now
[2:01:15] they will know that someone is not
[2:01:17] scripturally vindicated or called by God
[2:01:22] but the things he is speaking are too
[2:01:23] realistic.
[2:01:26] So they fall for it.
[2:01:29] Never fall for reasoning.
[2:01:35] Today, today is what all people want.
[2:01:40] Oh, blood on your hands, boils of fire
[2:01:42] on the platform,
[2:01:45] oil in your fingers,
[2:01:49] emotion, things of excitement. And the
[2:01:51] same thing produces women preachers
[2:01:53] short hair bob makeup and what do you
[2:01:55] have?
[2:02:18] But you see that's the way of
[2:02:22] Brother, there is only one god
[2:02:25] vindicated prophet in our day.
[2:02:30] Forget about anyone's interpretation.
[2:02:34] People are falling for things. Oh, pit
[2:02:37] of fire here. Oh, oil on your fingers.
[2:02:41] Oh, this and that. This sign, that sign,
[2:02:43] this sign. They are not my prophet.
[2:02:49] I Moses I know him.
[2:02:52] Hallelujah.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; You see and they do the same thing and I
[2:02:57] turn away the true word for
[2:02:58] denomination.
[2:03:03] It shows what kind of cities in them.
[2:03:06] But thank God all Israel never fell for
[2:03:07] Quran.
[2:03:11] Some stayed by Moses.
[2:03:14] the anointed prophet with the word of
[2:03:16] God.
[2:03:19] Amen. We are one of those. We have
[2:03:22] stayed with our Moses
[2:03:25] with the what? The word of God.
[2:03:28] Hallelujah. Amen. A man is God. Many of
[2:03:31] God is elected.
[2:03:34] So it is with them today
[2:03:37] by his word and his spirit. God, that's
[2:03:41] how he rules his church.
[2:03:44] calls a man and when that man heeds his
[2:03:47] calling,
[2:03:49] he will lead a church
[2:03:52] using the word and the spirit.
[2:03:56] Amen.
[2:03:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. In 15 minutes now, let us go to 1
[2:04:03] Samuel
[2:04:07] um chapter 8 vers one.
[2:04:11] I want to show you an example here which
[2:04:12] will blow your mind.
[2:04:17] Um, and it came to pass when Samuel was
[2:04:19] old that he made his sons judges over
[2:04:21] Israel.
[2:04:25] Now, let me just read it as you read in
[2:04:26] your language. Now, the name of his
[2:04:28] firstborn was Joel, and the name of his
[2:04:30] second, Abia, and they were judges in
[2:04:32] Bashba. and his sons walked not in his
[2:04:35] ways, but turned aside after lockup, and
[2:04:38] took bribes, and perverted judgment.
[2:04:40] Then all the elders of Israel gathered
[2:04:42] themselves together, and came to Samuel
[2:04:43] unto Rama. And I said unto him, Behold,
[2:04:46] thou art at old, and thy sons walked not
[2:04:47] in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge
[2:04:51] us like all the nations. But a thing
[2:04:54] displeased Samuel when they said, Give
[2:04:57] us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed
[2:04:59] unto the Lord. You see, that's what they
[2:05:01] always do, men of God.
[2:05:03] And the Lord said unto Samuel, hecken
[2:05:06] unto the voice of the people in all that
[2:05:08] they have said unto thee, for they have
[2:05:10] not rejected thee, but they have
[2:05:12] rejected me, that I should not reign
[2:05:15] over them, according to all the works
[2:05:17] which they have done since the day that
[2:05:19] I brought them out from Egypt, even unto
[2:05:21] this day, wherewith they have forsaken
[2:05:23] me, and served other gods, and so do
[2:05:25] they also unto thee. Now therefore
[2:05:28] hecken unto their voice, how bait yet
[2:05:31] protestly unto them, and show them the
[2:05:33] manner of the king that shall reign over
[2:05:36] them. I want you to see Samuel.
[2:05:39] God after bringing this people by Moses
[2:05:44] and Joshua and all others, now they are
[2:05:46] in the promised land. And here is a man
[2:05:49] called by God. And his name is Samuel,
[2:05:53] the anointed man of the hour. He was a
[2:05:56] prophet.
[2:05:57] The one that said that say the Lord.
[2:06:00] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. I said hallelujah. A man
[2:06:04] that heard from God.
[2:06:06] Oh, I can even go back and remind you
[2:06:09] how Samuel was called. how his mother
[2:06:12] was barren
[2:06:14] and how she went before God
[2:06:17] and sister Hannah called upon her and
[2:06:20] she said, "Oh God, if you give me a boy,
[2:06:24] if you give me a son, I'll give him unto
[2:06:26] you."
[2:06:29] Right?
[2:06:31] But right here,
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; I want you to notice Samuel when he was
[2:06:36] born,
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; she gave him to the Lord.
[2:06:41] in the hands of prophet Eli.
[2:06:44] And God started speaking to Samuel
[2:06:48] from a very young
[2:06:53] Hallelujah.
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you notice when whenever
[2:07:00] God calls a man,
[2:07:02] he comes at him early
[2:07:07] before the devil corrupts them
[2:07:10] early before the devil brings in this
[2:07:12] and that
[2:07:15] to preserve and protect the integrity of
[2:07:18] the word.
[2:07:20] God came to Samuel at a very young age
[2:07:24] and he said Samuel Samuel Samuel ran to
[2:07:27] Ellie called a second time and Ellie was
[2:07:31] a priest and God could not speak to him
[2:07:36] because the man of the hour
[2:07:39] was Samuel
[2:07:41] because God had a covenant
[2:07:45] with Hannah about the child he would
[2:07:50] Let me tell you brother, don't play with
[2:07:52] servants of God.
[2:07:55] Many of these are under covenant with
[2:07:57] God
[2:07:59] before they are even born and they
[2:08:02] coming into the world to fulfill a
[2:08:05] purpose. They are servants of God.
[2:08:08] That's why God protects them so
[2:08:13] to the extent we see here in the
[2:08:16] situation of Moses. He killed hund
[2:08:20] because of Moses. Oh friend. It is very
[2:08:24] very serious. And then now we see that
[2:08:27] Samuel and a covenant now leads Israel
[2:08:33] and leads Israel until he grows old.
[2:08:37] And apparently it looks like Samuel had
[2:08:39] a succession plan for Israel
[2:08:45] because God had called him. But God had
[2:08:48] called no other after him.
[2:08:51] Did you know
[2:08:53] servants of God never resigned?
[2:08:57] Servants of God never retire.
[2:09:00] Can I hear a bigger man if you believe
[2:09:02] that?
[2:09:04] Praise God. They serve for life
[2:09:08] until they die. That's why brother Bam,
[2:09:11] you know, in the message, you know, not
[2:09:13] not a specific message, but all through
[2:09:14] his message,
[2:09:17] It it it shows how important it is for
[2:09:19] you to be sure of who is your pastor.
[2:09:25] Very important. This is a man who is
[2:09:27] going to lead you to your eternal
[2:09:28] destination.
[2:09:32] If he doesn't have a backbone for the
[2:09:33] word,
[2:09:35] you cannot make it, brother.
[2:09:38] God help us. We don't go to a church
[2:09:42] because it is the nearest church.
[2:09:45] We go to a church Because the man that
[2:09:47] is preaching on that book has a backbone
[2:09:51] for the world.
[2:09:53] Praise God. And notice here Samuel is
[2:09:58] now old, stricken in age. He didn't know
[2:10:01] what next. God had not called anybody
[2:10:03] else. God was silent about what next.
[2:10:09] Because when God calls a man, he owns
[2:10:12] both his mistakes
[2:10:15] and his success.
[2:10:24] That's why it is important if you're
[2:10:27] married to a man of God
[2:10:29] to know how to behave.
[2:10:33] If if you you you gave birth to a man of
[2:10:36] God,
[2:10:37] you have to know how you behave.
[2:10:40] God comes to speak to brother Bham.
[2:10:42] Brother runs to the house. What if the
[2:10:46] mother had slapped him?
[2:10:50] What if the mother had abused him?
[2:10:53] The mother. You are stupid. What are you
[2:10:57] talking about? Can't speak. But that was
[2:11:00] the angel of the Lord.
[2:11:02] The pill of fire was right at you.
[2:11:06] So parents, if you know you are raising
[2:11:09] a servant of God,
[2:11:12] do it with reverence.
[2:11:16] You can know by how you see the child
[2:11:19] growing by the confidence you made with
[2:11:21] God when the the child was born.
[2:11:24] You can know you do it with reverence.
[2:11:28] Knowing God can actually you can have
[2:11:30] trouble with God
[2:11:33] by dealing with them in a wrong way.
[2:11:38] Samuel is now old. He doesn't know what
[2:11:41] next for his family. But you see, he
[2:11:44] decided to make his sons
[2:11:49] judges. Did God tell him? I'm not sure.
[2:11:54] I didn't read it anyway.
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; But
[2:11:58] but
[2:12:00] we know the chance of Samuel did not go
[2:12:05] in the way of their father.
[2:12:08] They did not follow after the pattern of
[2:12:10] their father
[2:12:15] just like the sons of Eli.
[2:12:20] God have mercy.
[2:12:23] God have mercy.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And when I say that, I
[2:12:28] mean it.
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; It is very rare
[2:12:34] to see a David giving birth to Solomon.
[2:12:39] Usually children of servants of God go
[2:12:41] wayward.
[2:12:45] But God have mercy on our generation
[2:12:49] that they may go in the way of the
[2:12:51] world.
[2:12:53] But you see, he decided to make his
[2:12:56] sons,
[2:12:58] not that his sons were called,
[2:13:01] but he decided to make his sons
[2:13:05] judges in Israel, but they did not do
[2:13:08] the right thing. The Bible says they
[2:13:11] they went after filthy ler
[2:13:16] money
[2:13:21] to taking bribes
[2:13:23] perverting judgment.
[2:13:25] And the elders in Israel
[2:13:28] they saw that they were unhappy
[2:13:33] and they came to someone. Their reasons
[2:13:36] were justified.
[2:13:38] Their reasons were right.
[2:13:40] They came to Samuel and told him,
[2:13:43] "Prophet Samuel,
[2:13:45] you you you have served us well,
[2:13:48] but your children who are judge over us
[2:13:53] have not gone in the way that you have
[2:13:55] been going in. So we ask you of one,
[2:14:00] give us a king."
[2:14:03] That was a wrong h request at a wrong
[2:14:07] time.
[2:14:11] For as long as Samuel was alive,
[2:14:15] he was still the leader of God's people.
[2:14:19] [Applause]
[2:14:20] But they asked a wrong request.
[2:14:26] You see, maybe someone made a mistake
[2:14:30] to appoint his sons.
[2:14:33] We do not know. But God owned his
[2:14:36] mistakes too.
[2:14:40] God has a way of liking how to correct
[2:14:43] his own servants.
[2:14:48] Israel instead of inquiring from God
[2:14:52] because you ask me, "Pastor, what would
[2:14:54] they have done?
[2:14:56] In such a situation,
[2:14:59] well, instead of doing a political move,
[2:15:05] they would have gone to God in prayer.
[2:15:09] Brother, whenever you have a
[2:15:10] misunderstanding,
[2:15:13] go to God in prayer.
[2:15:16] Listen, I've never been anointed more
[2:15:18] than right now.
[2:15:20] And I'm telling you these things from
[2:15:23] the Holy Spirit. Amen. You husbands, you
[2:15:27] husbands, lead your family right.
[2:15:30] Be led of the Lord. Be guided by the
[2:15:33] Holy Spirit. But sisters, wives, be
[2:15:37] careful, your headship is not Jesus. It
[2:15:40] is your husband.
[2:15:43] Even when he is wrong,
[2:15:46] don't fight him. Don't call your father,
[2:15:49] your mother, your sister, your
[2:15:52] go to God in prayer.
[2:15:55] on your knees
[2:15:57] because if God gave you your husband,
[2:16:00] he cannot come by another way
[2:16:04] to give you leadership. It is through
[2:16:06] the God ordained leadership.
[2:16:10] Because if you go to God in prayer,
[2:16:13] the God who gave him can give another
[2:16:18] or can correct him or can take him away
[2:16:21] or can do whatever is required.
[2:16:25] And so it is even in a church.
[2:16:28] Never begin murmuring about the pastor
[2:16:30] and the leaders of the church.
[2:16:35] That is the way of kora.
[2:16:38] The moment you begin murmuring
[2:16:41] against the pastor, against the
[2:16:43] minister, against the you know your
[2:16:47] points may be justified,
[2:16:51] but it is you who will go into trouble
[2:16:52] with God.
[2:16:56] This was the way of Kora.
[2:16:59] They did they did not inquire from God.
[2:17:02] They connived and made a decision
[2:17:06] to have a new king.
[2:17:09] Was God in that decision?
[2:17:11] No. This was the way of Kora. It was not
[2:17:15] the way of God.
[2:17:18] Even when the pastor has done a mistake,
[2:17:21] even when he's guilty,
[2:17:24] there is a pattern. There is a way that
[2:17:27] God has given to us
[2:17:30] to correct the man of God.
[2:17:33] And I want you to follow me closely as I
[2:17:36] am approaching the climax here. In 1
[2:17:38] Samuel 10, Samuel went ahead and and
[2:17:42] gave them a king
[2:17:45] because God told him, "Don't you worry
[2:17:47] my man, they have not rejected you, they
[2:17:51] have rejected me."
[2:17:54] And so Samuel in verse 17,
[2:17:57] he says, Samuel called the people
[2:17:58] together unto the Lord to misbehaith
[2:18:04] the Lord God of Israel.
[2:18:07] I brought you up uh Israel out of Egypt
[2:18:12] and delivered you out of the land of
[2:18:13] Egyptians, out of the hand of the all
[2:18:15] the kingdoms and of them that oppressed
[2:18:18] you. You have this day
[2:18:23] rejected your God, who himself saved you
[2:18:26] out of all your adversities
[2:18:29] and your tribulations.
[2:18:31] And ye have said unto him, Nay, but set
[2:18:34] us a king over us.
[2:18:38] Now therefore, present yourselves before
[2:18:40] the Lord,
[2:18:43] by your tribes,
[2:18:46] and by your thousands
[2:18:48] and after that
[2:18:51] he gave them a king,
[2:18:53] anointed him turned out to be Saul. You
[2:18:57] know how Saul ended up and you know
[2:18:59] friends, God is God. He wants to be king
[2:19:03] of your life.
[2:19:05] He he wants to be your pastor.
[2:19:08] He wants to be your leader. He wants to
[2:19:10] be your shepherd.
[2:19:12] But how does he do that? He sent a man
[2:19:17] like the Bible says in the book of
[2:19:19] Jeremiah, a pastor after his own heart.
[2:19:27] Praise God.
[2:19:30] And in this generation,
[2:19:32] he sent us one in our local assemblies.
[2:19:36] sends us each one.
[2:19:38] We should always honor men of God.
[2:19:43] But he sends us 1 Timothy 5:17, "Let the
[2:19:48] elders that rule well be counted worthy
[2:19:50] of double honor,
[2:19:54] especially they who labor in the word
[2:19:56] and doctrine."
[2:19:59] When God sends you a man
[2:20:02] who said an elder is a man who is
[2:20:06] seasoned in the word
[2:20:10] in the Lord,
[2:20:15] not a new believer, not a new preacher,
[2:20:18] whatever, no matter how powerful he is,
[2:20:21] someone who is older in the Lord,
[2:20:24] you see, and is laboring in word and
[2:20:26] doctrine,
[2:20:29] he deserves loves not just honor
[2:20:32] double honor
[2:20:37] DVF.
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; I will pound this until we all receive
[2:20:40] it
[2:20:44] and then you can be an example to this
[2:20:46] generation.
[2:20:52] Isn't it what we're supposed to be
[2:20:55] to be a reason of all men?
[2:21:00] 1 Timothy 5:18.
[2:21:02] &gt;&gt; For the scripture saith, thou shalt not
[2:21:04] m the ox that treth out the corn, and
[2:21:06] the laborer is worthy of his reward.
[2:21:10] Against an elder, receive not an
[2:21:13] accusation.
[2:21:15] Come on, brother. Interpret what you
[2:21:17] remember. against an elder receive not
[2:21:20] an an accusation.
[2:21:24] &gt;&gt; Just do verse 19, leave vers 18 because
[2:21:26] it will mess you up. Against an elder,
[2:21:29] receive not an accusation.
[2:21:36] Against an elder, receive not an
[2:21:38] accusation.
[2:21:44] Water it down in Luganda and make people
[2:21:46] understand what the Bible is saying.
[2:21:51] No.
[2:22:01] Amen. Open it and read it in the in the
[2:22:04] in the Lugana Bible. Again, receive not
[2:22:06] an accusation, but before two or three
[2:22:09] witnesses, them that sin, rebuke before
[2:22:13] all that others also may fear. 1
[2:22:15] Timothy, I want to finish now. 1 Timothy
[2:22:17] 5:18. Quickly,
[2:22:44] don't receive an accusation.
[2:22:55] Did you hear what the pastor said?
[2:22:58] Maybe that be your pastor. Maybe you
[2:23:00] went to a convention
[2:23:03] and you heard rumors
[2:23:05] talking against men of God
[2:23:07] and then you also join in. Can you
[2:23:10] imagine that pastor? Are they even
[2:23:13] saved?
[2:23:15] You a believer?
[2:23:18] Watch out.
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; Never receive an accusation.
[2:23:24] Anybody who brings it to you, close your
[2:23:27] ears and walk away
[2:23:30] whether the man that is being accused is
[2:23:32] your pastor or not.
[2:23:36] But as long as he's an elder,
[2:23:38] do not receive an accusation.
[2:23:44] But if you want to, you must have two or
[2:23:47] three witnesses.
[2:23:51] And brother Bham says those must even be
[2:23:53] tried.
[2:23:55] [Music]
[2:24:00] Friends,
[2:24:03] I wanted to read you quotes in Hebrews
[2:24:05] series,
[2:24:08] but I'll give you the quote 570922E.
[2:24:11] Go and listen to it.
[2:24:14] There quite a lot in there.
[2:24:16] Quite a lot in there. But the time I've
[2:24:19] asked you is over and I need to get done
[2:24:21] now.
[2:24:23] But friends, the narrow way
[2:24:26] is not going in the way of Kora.
[2:24:33] It doesn't matter. You may not go the
[2:24:34] way of Cain.
[2:24:37] You may not go in the way of Balam.
[2:24:40] You believe the message, but in the
[2:24:43] message, you go in the way of God.
[2:24:48] Start talking against men of God.
[2:24:51] start reducing their influence,
[2:24:55] disrespecting them,
[2:24:58] rumor, spreading rumors about them.
[2:25:02] I've showed you true or false.
[2:25:05] God will deal with you thoroughly.
[2:25:11] This is a warning to us as a church.
[2:25:15] How should we keep ourel
[2:25:19] with fear and trembling
[2:25:21] knowing that this is not about a man,
[2:25:25] it's not about brother, it's not about
[2:25:28] your pastor, it's about Christ
[2:25:31] and when he wants you to be blessed,
[2:25:36] he sends you a man, but honor that man
[2:25:41] says he can't even help you if you do
[2:25:43] not honor
[2:25:46] There's nothing he can do for you. He
[2:25:49] said, "I've seen congregations run down
[2:25:50] the pastor and talk about him and do
[2:25:51] this and that.
[2:25:55] There's nothing he can do for you."
[2:25:57] See, so and I've I've been raised to do
[2:26:00] that.
[2:26:03] And and there's a quote I read says no
[2:26:05] matter what the past the man has done
[2:26:10] if you can't respect him
[2:26:13] respect the office
[2:26:17] he holds in God.
[2:26:22] If we can do that
[2:26:24] then we are walking in a narrow.
[2:26:28] May God bless you.
[2:26:30] You may stand on your feet.
[2:26:34] [Applause]
[2:26:36] [Music]
[2:26:44] Praise God.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; Do not end that is the way.
[2:26:50] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[2:26:53] I have only spoken according to how you
[2:26:55] have led me.
[2:27:02] My desire Lord is that uh
[2:27:05] people may see you Lord Jesus.
[2:27:10] They may see beyond the man and see you
[2:27:12] Lord
[2:27:16] but also understand the principles of
[2:27:17] your word.
[2:27:21] Jude warned the church told us not to go
[2:27:24] the way of Kora.
[2:27:27] &gt;&gt; Many young people
[2:27:28] in our generation
[2:27:31] have gone wayward
[2:27:34] thinking they standing but fallen long
[2:27:38] going into the way of Kora the gain
[2:27:41] sayings of Kora
[2:27:44] Lord Jesus
[2:27:46] help us to respect the ministry
[2:27:50] the pastors
[2:27:51] the teachers the evangelists
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; the apostles
[2:27:56] the prophets
[2:27:58] that you have sent to us,
[2:28:01] that we may know how to discern
[2:28:05] the right from the wrong
[2:28:08] that we may walk according to your ways
[2:28:11] that we may please you Lord.
[2:28:14] Grant it, Lord.
[2:28:17] Bless these people, Father. Even as we
[2:28:20] are going to dismiss tonight,
[2:28:22] I ask that your presence will go with
[2:28:25] us, Lord. And even Lord before we go, we
[2:28:28] want to give our offerings.
