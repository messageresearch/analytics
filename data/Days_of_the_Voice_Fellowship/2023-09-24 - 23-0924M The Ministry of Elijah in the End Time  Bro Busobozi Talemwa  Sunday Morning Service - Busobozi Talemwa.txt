blessing and may she shine with the glory of God Amen Amina let us our heads [Music] let us pray Our Kind Heavenly Father foreign while the disciples thought that that was not important and that it was more important for you to deal with the adults for such is the kingdom of it and this little baby Lord that you've given gifted to our brother Emmanuel and sister Ruth [Music] in my arms today in the representation of you Lord receiving her and Lord I know that you are the same yesterday today and foreign [Music] [Music] the Lord has given I spoke by inspiration a little a few minutes ago

Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] I remember some years ago you know in Ethiopia it's kind of special you know myself I mean even when it comes to attack with sickness in the hands of God do we believe that so we appreciate all the babies in in our fellowship God has blessed us with a lot of children I don't know how many to us [Music] we are now going to go to the scripture in the before I got a little inspiration to speak on this when I was speaking with a a relative or a cousin to brother Barker then you're gonna know which I trust it will be maybe a few services on this subject and I believe it will be a blessings let us first speak to the Lord and then we shall read this Lord we we humble ourselves just come and have your way give the service to you now you are the one that we want to to speak to us you are the one we have come to me you are the one that we desire oh sweet Spirit come and speak to us let your light shine through Us by the ministry of Your World many have come from others are streaming with us or online [Music] but I know that all these are souls of people seeking for you have a minister to them through our lips check me out of the way may your Holy Spirit granted Lord in the name of it amen Amina so we are reading verses 5. read one verse to them amen behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so what I would like to do to deal with in in this service I'm speaking on the ministry of Elijah in the end times the ministry of Elijah in the end times away has placed everything that the human race needs in the world [Music] everything is here no so this morning I'm asking you to put on your spiritual thinking tips so that we can learn a few things together and I know this subject is wide um the way I want to deal with it so I will just take a few pieces here and there and I know some of you may learn a few things today for the first time so if you have a pen and you want to write down a few scriptures or a few ideas or whatever that the whole spirit will inspire you to receive he was speaking to us on Friday on the power of the importance of inspiration the Holy Spirit inspires me um I'm speaking I'm going to speak to you by inspiration but you also Must Be Inspired while you are receiving it they don't just receive it when you are dormant receive it when you are when you are active if I bring if the Holy Spirit brings it through me brings it through me on fire that is how it ought to be praise the Lord so now we are dealing with the spirit of Elijah but today I just want to give more of the service today is really the background so whatever God knew that the human race will need he has blessed it in the Bible there is no new thing under the Earth everything that is has been your name is everything that shall be is already is so what is the work of the Bible the work of the Bible is to show us things which were things which are interested and things that is why if you do not read the Bible people you are in a lot of danger if you don't understand scriptures you will not know where you are well you know you are in Kampala Uganda but you will not know where you are in the timeline of God so you don't even know where you are in your life but if you read if you were a Bible reader Bible you will know everything about your life you will know where you have been a joke you know where you are and you will know where you are going there is nothing going to take you by surprise praise the Lord everything is going to be accounted foreign [Music] if you can give me a little more sound so then these um these people as they were preaching to them a little child one woman almost like Elijah here today and you know he came and asked this man I have one question for you they said which generation are we in he said we are in the invention of his excellence wow the child looked at the man um of about seven years TV but a little child looked at him with those eyes then that means you have nothing to say to me about the Bible the little child knew more than the preachers if you don't read the Bible you will not know you will think that is to you it should be [Music] shall be manifest [Music] they are going to receive them with miracles signs and wonders and God has promised that there will be an Elijah Minnesota which will restore everything but he also says the minister of Elijah will be the ministry of the seventh Angels praise the name of the Lord foreign right from the days of the Apostles you know I realize the message is quite a lot of information but we in this church we concentrate on the life of the message more than the information just to put the whole you know some flesh on what we believe praise the name of the Lord so now I want you to see in the Book of Daniel while Daniel was praying then idiot yes well Daniel was crying because the Jews at that time they were in captivity and Daniel was bothered [Music] what would happen for 500 years [Music] God will show me the future even about my own life we think that spirituality is just getting excited you know you know you know gifts and all those things but it is built upon the foundation of Revelations on the foundation of revelation God revealed to uh what would happen almost 500 years then I don't want to spend time with the weeks of the of the Jews the Jews God deals with them as a nation as a nation in the Bible here one of my Bible we even have a number of the Jews who are going to be safe does anybody know it is foreign foreign yes Elijah area that is the last Ministry of Elijah in the Empire where is that is not for the Gentiles for the Jews but for us we are Gentiles we must also have our own Elijah Ministries by Grace but by Design God Purpose ministry will go to the Jews one week is how many years seven years so the Jews traveled one last half are you there one first half rather of the last week when Jesus died yesterday when the Messiah was cut off from that time from City the time of the Jews were supposed God is no longer working with the Jews right now we're talking if you read your Bible The Book of Romans the Bible says the Jews they are blinded so they can't see they have eyes because God has blinded them why why because they rejected the Messiah Messiah and why did God blind them because he had another group of people who are they that is the Gentile price and I am one of them this morning that is why we are excited about this Jesus creation because the Jews [Music] foreign [Music] if you are there you say Amen [Music] okay those of you who said amen can you read it in Romans 11. praise the name of them I want to show you a portion here can someone read verse 25. for I would not oh my God it's all nice can someone come up here and read it okay got it Romance Romans chapter 11 verse 24. for if Thou Art cut out of the Olive Tree which is well by nature and word graft contrary to Nature into a good Olive Tree how much more shall these which be the natural the natural branches be gruffed into their own Olive Tree 25 for I would note Brethren that here should be ignorant of this mystery lest here should be wise in your own concerts that that blindness in part is happening to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in bless you come on praise the name of the Lord oh my appreciation like I feel like preaching this the Bible said here indeed that don't take oh my God he can't interpret Lucas said deeper deeper than he is oh my I don't know how to say that take a heart I don't know how to say that for sure but listen he says if you you the Gentiles you were the Wild Olive Tree um where they one that was supposed to be the original price the Jews refused and then he wanted to award the wild into the world of Uganda again you got the word of Kenya can you know the word of America in the word of London Square and Africa Africa the wild the Wilderness where the Gentiles were leaving and he cut off a branch and he brought it onto the Olive Tree what is the Olive Tree the olive trees Jesus himself the Jews if he was not able foreign [Music] the original [Music] but if you read revelation what is the fullness of the Gentiles the fullness of the Gentiles is spoken in Generations in a period of Ages when did it started when God called Soul captain and he told him I'm commissioning to preach my message and Paul became the Apostle to the Gentiles amen started going all over the world most of the New Testament piercing is written by Apostle Paul yeah [Music] I mean yes I'm giving you a lot of information this morning so I wanted to put on your spiritual thinking [Music] okay if you close your eyes you will miss I've met a few Jews some of them are even artists the gender dispensation is over and the gentle dispensation is over um you brothers and sisters go out and tell others time is soon and very soon Jesus is going back to the Jews will be left with their denominations but out of the Gentiles Jesus Jesus has a purpose yes out of the gentle church not everyone Among The Gents foreign you know he was the only one that did not die by being murdered all the others they killed them they caught him to kill him they couldn't catch him one time when they caught him he said this guy is very sneaky let us boil him so that we can be sure he's dead they fired up a drum of oil yeah and they want to sleep of course he's dead in the morning they found the guy there [Music] said this guy he said he's a witch we are going to banish him and they threw him to an island and when you read in the Book of Revelation one of the first words I wanted to see what it says praise the Lord he says I John is who also am your brother and companion in Tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ and he says I was in the spirit so some of us people who believe that the Lord this day is this yes it used to be before Jesus Christ but after Jesus Christ Jesus said I am the lord of the cies [Music] Legend I will give you rest for your soul meaning he said I will give you some beauty cease to just be a time period of 24 hours 12 hours it is now given by the lord of the Sabbath foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign those are the works we rest forever when we are in our Sabbath oh praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord so John was taken to the island he began to see Vision his submission Vision after vision of the whole future he saw about Israel he saw about the gentle church it's about everything and when it comes to the gentle Church seven golden candlesticks are you hearing me and there was one in the middle of the candlestics not to reveal Ed so it is still sealed Elijah's Ministers of the seven churches to the Gentiles foreign [Music] [Music] how many Churches of Christ do we have to remember foreign [Music] but now negative it is one Church while the seven churches now you actually mechanisms are just generation of the same church Ghana mechanism [Music] the first one was it yeah The Messengers [Music] and those people to be prepared for the Rapture they had to believe the message of their Messengers that is true they believe they believe Paul Paul is the messenger foreign foreign okay if Paul power is the only one but I how come we all are going to be judged by this is our generation we are facing different things that Paul never even talked about Paul never talked about TV he never talked about the internet God is orderly [Music] foreign foreign foreign and they would lay down their very lives for the sake of the revelation of the message they had received I was told that it was not safe Integra bank but if God has laid on my on my heart abandoned to God how can I stand between before John Wesley was about age people were moved around some sort of Revival Nevada foreign and that's the age we are living when God sends a messenger the star to the last age there will be no time left after his message the only thing left for God to go back again I want to announcement some of you who may not have known this messenger his message has been sounded when some of you may be streaming you don't know who he is he is Elijah that was promised to come here that's the ministry of Elijah come here the seventh angel messenger his name is William Branham William Branham we are not following a man too just like they never followed we will lose their wisely which is to take us back praise God here we are one over two two six right at the end community [Music] foreign okay if you are following this message we are going to walk with you together now as long as you are hot cast if you are not hot the conditions will be unfavorable for you that's the truth de Maxima how many people entered the Ark of North Carolina very many they even helped him back here they even helped him but how many states foreign the only thing that makes us different is we are standing for truth not numbers not ideas we are standing for the Holy Ghost not for money see me our preachers Don't Preach for money and because you don't preach for money foreign [Music] there's a big blessing and then you see people running 20 people 34. the man has already made 60 minutes and then he begins to bless now oh I feel the anointed it's not the anointing of God if you don't know it and you have never had one million in your pockets there is this money called geology he quickly went there yet he he was he has who picked it from the the the the the the the man there yes yes quickly went and told him because you know the man went to bring boat money to appreciate the man of God because of healing him again and the man of God Elijah said I Don't Preach for money I don't want you to appreciate me don't see me appreciate God see my cartoon is the pastors to tell you I believe it must affect some anointing not saying the Lord some more money she will not go without something the guy took it in his house foreign foreign all the days of his life it's just praise God the guy who was anointed even for God the power that was in the man he forgot the power of the spoken nonetheless as much as man is that way it doesn't mean that we should not forgive us to the extent that some Believers don't even pay their Titans anymore and then it is a surprise that you are surprised that things are not going well for you things are not well for me did you when when will the outside be paid your time not some of it all of it all of it for who for God he wants to understand you to understand all your blessings of all our earnings that is the only scripture where God says in Malachi 3 says and see if I will not power blessings it is foreign you see I don't play your ties everywhere nice to your local child is not a church near you where you feed from yeah where there is a pastor that you believe is the man of God that God has sent to minister to you and I don't only want your type when I cannot Pastor you I must be able to bastard I must be able to teach you you must be able to cancel because that's the way that God has ordained in the world don't send me your time when you are not coming yeah foreign [Music] so who is he to you oh he's a preacher I like what if you like him but you don't like him enough to be your pastor then you can't pay your time but if if he is your pastor you believe is your past and you are suffering you are laboring and you are not doing well financially don't you worry God is responsible for that condition so come to him he will give you guidance there is nothing that goes amiss because we we ignore this simple simple things you find some people suffering unnecessary yet there is foreign foreign do you realize even in heaven they were not actually the same the way we think we'll see this man is because is not good foreign foreign okay foreign what about the Gentiles two things happen to them who had the messengers message those who did not accept it they'll remain here what will be happening with them tribulation today with their messages [Music] that kind of gospel prepares them for the tribulation I don't know [Music] during that same time will always produce the same results some reasons every Bible hear him and those Jews already I have may not all of them will be saved but there will also be an elect among them and they will have a number 144 000. um then the Bible says you know people have been talking about it and the Biden has been talking about it but let me tell you it is not coming when I am still yes foreign foreign on a white horse and the Bible says they took all their weapons but the Bible says and destroyed all of them Jesus Christ himself because when it comes down he comes to change the world he come to bring a new civilization he comes down hallelujah amen the Bible says the kingdoms of the world will become the kingdom Jesus Christ in the city where will the bride be oh my God we shall come with him for a space of one thousands Jesus yes we'll take the Throne of David to fulfill the scripture that is of Jesus he will reign and the bride by his sons [Applause] because we oh my goodness we have been already exonerated from that moment from that moment there we shall judge with him don't worry if you think these are stories it's what the Bible says these are prophecies but I'm preaching for two reasons so that you can rejoice and prepare well for that number two if you are going to remain here when you're suffering you know for how long this will be be on fire foreign let us read first king 17.7 and the word of the Lord came unto me saying arise get thee to zeropath which belongeth to zidane to come and dwell there behold I have commanded that with a woman there to suspend it changes so he arose and went to zeropath and when he came to the gate of the city behold the widow woman was there Gatherings of their Gathering of things and he called to her and said fetch me I pray thee a little water and a vessel that I may drink and as she was going to fetch it yeah bring me I pray thee and most of bread and she said as the Lord thy God lives foreign and a little oil in a cruise and behold I am Gathering two sticks that I may go in and distress it for me and my son that we may eat and die today go and do thou as thou has said but make me thereof a little cake fast have you had that if you want blessings this is how it is [Music] sorry no blessings make me there of a little cake fast soccer and bring it to me and after for yourself even for a child last year God does things in ways the barrel of milk shall not waste except neither shall the crews of oil Faith until the day that the Lord and she went and did according to the saying of her life did he eat many days according to the word of the Lord which is back by Elijah so today I was giving you a foundation a little investor here which the Bible now says there was a handful of nails and also there was a cruise with little oil but listen to what a man of God when Elijah came here oh my I feel so good about this he has a special meaning he comes to multiply he comes to restore he comes to put in place was not there he comes with authorities when Elijah comes he is not presuming he is not guessing he has a thus saith the Lord Elijah [Music] [Music] foreign Supreme prosperity Hallelujah he told the woman go and bake me bread and again she said I'm only getting two sticks two sticks we just eat you know the little muscle of of of oil of bread you know that's it called oil a meal of he says we have a handful of of meal in a box and we also have a little a little oil in the cruise I mean I'm gathering two sticks if you want to be blessed by the minister of your life stop thinking about yourself stop talking about your family think about the word of God when God has your family and yourself taken care of already oh am I preaching to someone am I preaching to someone here today and painfully but by Revelation let me tell you something no man can believe the minister of Elijah to those to whom it is she thought she was accepting painfully foreign what is your condition let us first bring it from again this is where your inspiration helps my inspiration alone cannot do it some of you receive inspiration and it can change your life foreign [Music] foreign suffering pain heartbreaks this woman she was heartbroken but in other conditions in that situation [Music] let us lift God out of History right now foreign [Music] [Music] foreign what is God telling you to do in your life sacrifice sacrifice leave certain things if you've come to this message the Battle of meal shall not rest neither shall the crews of oil the butter of milk shall not waste I need to put it in my life oh my the battle as long as I believe the word your supply shall not well your supply shall not work if you if it is dwindling down you have a prophecy it is will shall not waste Hallelujah do you believe it is not foreign foreign [Music] it works Brothers right now I feel like I can carry the world I'm telling you it's not my power because God is here I don't know what to say but as I'm concluding this is those are the same Services we have the services he says if you pray someone will reveal to me and he will be Discerning one person at that moment the purifier moves to another moves to another one God knows but if you can pray God speak about my situation just speak about situations because he's a god of Elijah he does not fail are you hearing me do you believe it's sister winning the proof of oil shall not run that's what it says are you hearing me you shall receive school fees he will provide foreign the Bible says the Bible says Hallelujah when she went back foreign foreign [Music] do you believe in miracles do you believe in miracles we believe in miracles our God is the god of Elijah he is doing Miracles right now to those not because I said it because you are receiving language if you believe it the same God must work he must Supply Hallelujah man it doesn't matter the economy no matter what is happening in Israel or in Uganda the god of Elijah is a God who knows No Boundaries he goes over and Beyond Hallelujah wow [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] lost but I want to say God is a good arrest [Music]
