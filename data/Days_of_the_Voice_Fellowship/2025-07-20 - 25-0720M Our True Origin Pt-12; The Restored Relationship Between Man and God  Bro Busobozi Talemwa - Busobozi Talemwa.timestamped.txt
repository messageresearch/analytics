[1:06:32] We will not have been better Lord.
[1:06:37] Father Lord there many souls dying in
[1:06:39] sin today.
[1:06:43] Not because there's no savior.
[1:06:47] but because you have not revealed
[1:06:48] yourself to them
[1:06:52] or perhaps they're not predestinated to
[1:06:54] life.
[1:06:57] But Lord, we are so glad this morning
[1:07:00] that we can worship you
[1:07:03] not because we have merited energy.
[1:07:08] Lord, we would have been as sinners and
[1:07:10] as bad as everybody else
[1:07:13] for that is what we are.
[1:07:16] But your grace Lord has lifted us out of
[1:07:19] the marriage.
[1:07:21] Amen. And you have set our feet on the
[1:07:23] rock.
[1:07:26] And Lord, you have defined us by what
[1:07:28] you have done.
[1:07:32] And we are so grateful this morning
[1:07:36] that we are who you said we are,
[1:07:42] sons and daughters of God.
[1:07:46] the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:49] Nothing else matters.
[1:07:53] No amount of powers of darkness.
[1:07:57] When the devil comes in like a fly,
[1:08:00] every time you will lift us,
[1:08:04] every time you give us grace to
[1:08:05] overcome,
[1:08:07] we are relying on you this morning.
[1:08:10] Every day of our life, Lord, we ask that
[1:08:13] you come and have your way.
[1:08:16] Take complete control,
[1:08:19] complete control
[1:08:22] through each life, each soul
[1:08:24] is under the sound of my voice.
[1:08:28] Father Lord, may you come and minister
[1:08:31] the words of life to us.
[1:08:33] May it quicken us. If there is seed here
[1:08:36] this morning, may they be quickened.
[1:08:40] If there is somebody with worry, may you
[1:08:42] take away worry, Lord. If there is
[1:08:44] someone with fear, may you melt all
[1:08:47] their fear.
[1:08:49] Somebody in sin, Lord, may you pull them
[1:08:52] out of it, Father.

[1:12:41] those visiting with us this morning, we
[1:12:44] want to welcome you and just certainly
[1:12:46] say that feel at home
[1:12:50] and just uh prepare yourself for the
[1:12:52] Lord to minister to you.

[1:12:56] morning? Amen.
[1:12:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Before we we just we're going to go in
[1:13:02] the book of 1 Timothy chapter 2.
[1:13:06] and while we are opening there,
[1:13:10] I just wanted to say I certainly
[1:13:12] appreciate all those that are giving
[1:13:15] generously towards our land
[1:13:19] fund.
[1:13:24] You know, someone has to raise to the
[1:13:26] challenge.
[1:13:32] It's never easy
[1:13:35] to all those churches that have uh
[1:13:37] bought their own church land and
[1:13:44] there are always many many people and
[1:13:46] not even very many in that church but a
[1:13:48] few in that church but many people um
[1:13:50] that really sacrifice a lot.
[1:13:58] And I wanted to say this
[1:14:00] for all those that sacrifice towards the
[1:14:02] work of God.
[1:14:05] It might not only be the land fund,
[1:14:09] might as well be anything else.
[1:14:12] God can never forget your labor.
[1:14:16] Not only in heaven, but even here on
[1:14:19] earth. Even here on earth.
[1:14:24] I I was called uh by Pastor Aaron.
[1:14:28] from Ombara
[1:14:30] and he had what we were announcing here
[1:14:34] and I know he told me that they already
[1:14:36] have their church land.
[1:14:39] &gt;&gt; He was telling me one one brother in the
[1:14:42] church that sacrificed
[1:14:46] his tuition money.
[1:14:49] Now this is not a school boy
[1:14:52] is I think it was for his master's
[1:14:54] program.
[1:14:58] And uh so this is um a grown man but so
[1:15:02] he he um he sacrificed it when they
[1:15:05] started their own land project
[1:15:10] and he gave it all.
[1:15:14] And long story short, he was telling me
[1:15:16] that the Lord blessed that brother
[1:15:20] and he made millions
[1:15:25] within such a short time
[1:15:28] during COVID when most of the people
[1:15:29] were suffering.
[1:15:34] If you want to be blessed,
[1:15:36] there is no shortcut.
[1:15:39] You can fast all you want. You can pray
[1:15:42] all you want. You can even work
[1:15:46] all you want.
[1:15:49] But if you do not give,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; you cannot be blessed.
[1:15:56] Now, I'm not talking about the blessing
[1:15:57] of the Lord
[1:16:00] because that comes by the word,
[1:16:04] but I'm talking about financial
[1:16:07] uh blessing.
[1:16:10] This is something I've taught here.
[1:16:13] And I believe it to be biblical
[1:16:16] that if you want to receive,
[1:16:19] the only way is to give.
[1:16:22] That's the only way that I see now. If
[1:16:26] there's any other that the Lord shows
[1:16:27] me, I I'll tell you
[1:16:31] here is a widow woman. And I hope you
[1:16:33] don't mind standing with me for just a
[1:16:35] moment.
[1:16:37] I'm going to sit for an hour. So
[1:16:40] you might as well stand for just a short
[1:16:41] time.
[1:16:43] You know this widow woman,
[1:16:46] she was just going to eat. She had a
[1:16:48] little
[1:16:50] and she was going to eat and die with
[1:16:54] that's all she knew. But here is a man
[1:16:56] of God who says, "Give me."
[1:16:59] And she sacrificed
[1:17:02] herself and her son
[1:17:04] for the Lord.
[1:17:07] And you know what happened?
[1:17:11] She never lacked anymore.
[1:17:14] And God provided to her in a way she
[1:17:16] least expect.
[1:17:19] She didn't I think she took a while
[1:17:20] before she realized that God had
[1:17:22] provided
[1:17:24] because whenever she went back,
[1:17:27] she found she found. So God can multiply
[1:17:31] the little that you have
[1:17:34] if you mind his work.
[1:17:38] If you give towards his word,
[1:17:41] those people that you are hearing that
[1:17:42] are giving, it's not because they have a
[1:17:43] lot.
[1:17:46] It is because they're sacrificing a lot.
[1:17:50] Is that right?
[1:17:52] That's right. And I just wanted to
[1:17:56] mention a few names and appreciate them.
[1:18:00] This week, we have a sister Jess who is
[1:18:02] not even a part of our church here.
[1:18:07] uh pastor Jess's wife
[1:18:11] and you know she she gave generously in
[1:18:14] the group of William Brham this week
[1:18:18] you know this sister's always been
[1:18:20] giving towards our land
[1:18:24] we certainly appreciate her very much
[1:18:31] if you have not given at least clap for
[1:18:32] the one that has given
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; Amen And um also I wanted to
[1:18:38] um mention that sister Martha
[1:18:44] you know when we went to the land last
[1:18:45] week on Sunday
[1:18:48] you know she was so impressed
[1:18:52] I'm thrilled with the land
[1:18:54] and you know you cannot tell God oh I'm
[1:18:56] I'm good I'm excited
[1:19:00] and there's nothing you have to show for
[1:19:03] she
[1:19:05] I'm going to take on my savings,
[1:19:09] all the people's savings.
[1:19:11] And she gave $500.
[1:19:15] And we sister Martha, we really
[1:19:17] appreciate you.
[1:19:19] Your labors of love will not be
[1:19:21] forgotten.
[1:19:23] I know that is a sacrifice.
[1:19:26] I know it is a sacrifice.
[1:19:29] And um there is this brother Neville
[1:19:32] who also I told you the other day
[1:19:35] you know he um um he came to me shortly
[1:19:39] after Sunday service
[1:19:42] before he even saw the land
[1:19:44] pastor you know what I don't know how
[1:19:47] but I'm going to give 2 million
[1:19:49] shillings before the market
[1:19:53] but I was like okay I know he's not even
[1:19:56] done with
[1:19:59] I was wondering how is he going to be?
[1:20:03] But the man had faith
[1:20:05] and I don't know how he he he he he
[1:20:07] convinced his parents
[1:20:10] but um um he informed me that his dad
[1:20:13] gave 1 million and his mom gave 1
[1:20:14] million
[1:20:18] and and and so
[1:20:24] these are people who don't even attend
[1:20:26] this church
[1:20:28] because of their son who attends
[1:20:32] you or he spoke to them. It means he was
[1:20:35] burdened.
[1:20:36] So you can't say I can't give
[1:20:40] you don't have you as you.
[1:20:43] God told Moses, "What do you have in
[1:20:46] your life?"
[1:20:49] Right? You have friends, you have
[1:20:52] parents,
[1:20:54] you have family.
[1:20:56] Talk to them. Tell them, "You know what?
[1:20:59] We are trying to contribute funds for
[1:21:00] our church life.
[1:21:04] Stand with me. This is a work of God.
[1:21:07] Don't be ashamed of it."
[1:21:10] So, brother Wera and um and brother Noah
[1:21:13] Wandera and his wife, we really want to
[1:21:14] say we appreciate very very much and
[1:21:17] brother Neville, thank you for taking
[1:21:19] that. I don't know is he here? Right
[1:21:21] over there. God bless you so much. I'm
[1:21:24] sorry I mentioned your name. Usually I
[1:21:25] don't, but I just felt the church should
[1:21:27] know
[1:21:30] and this could inspire somebody else.
[1:21:34] We really thank and brother brother
[1:21:36] Neville went ahead and you know he's a
[1:21:37] lawyer. He's
[1:21:40] a lawyer. Lawyer is not a judge.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; Okay, you can send.
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; So he he helped us to also do the uh
[1:21:53] legal due diligence for the land
[1:21:59] and we did not we paid for the process
[1:22:01] but we did not pay him a a cobo.
[1:22:08] He used his own transport,
[1:22:11] used his own knowledge with
[1:22:13] Let us give him a clap just amen.
[1:22:18] And he found that the land is legal,
[1:22:23] that the land is good
[1:22:26] and flowing with milk and honey.
[1:22:29] How many believe we are going to get
[1:22:30] this?
[1:22:32] Amen. And here's the good news.
[1:22:36] We are remaining with only about um not
[1:22:38] more than 4 millions
[1:22:42] to be able to uh to get to 100 million
[1:22:47] and that would be the initial payment
[1:22:51] which we need to pay by the end of this
[1:22:52] month.
[1:22:54] That's all we need.
[1:22:57] Remember we had a time when we had zero.
[1:23:01] Now we are remaining with 4 million.
[1:23:05] One of you can give it
[1:23:07] by the end of this service
[1:23:09] will be a sacrifice. You can say pastor
[1:23:12] here's the 4 million go and pay the
[1:23:15] downpay.
[1:23:17] Amen.
[1:23:19] Amen. Well, if you say big means you're
[1:23:22] going to do that.
[1:23:25] God bless you so much. And um and um I I
[1:23:30] um then the other remaining 120
[1:23:35] We will pay it in small installments
[1:23:37] within eight months.
[1:23:42] We will talk about that after we are
[1:23:43] done with what we are doing on the
[1:23:45] initial payment.
[1:23:49] Let's just quickly now go to the word
[1:23:53] 1 Timothy chapter 2
[1:23:56] 3.
[1:23:59] You know a brother told me
[1:24:03] believers can be spiritual if you talk
[1:24:04] about anything
[1:24:08] but money.
[1:24:11] When you talk about money,
[1:24:13] that's when you know that some brothers
[1:24:15] and sisters can be cano.
[1:24:20] And that's why God says, "Try me in
[1:24:23] this.
[1:24:26] Give your 10%.
[1:24:28] Give your offering. Just me in this. See
[1:24:32] if I will not open heaven and power a
[1:24:35] blessing to you." Do you think God needs
[1:24:38] your money?
[1:24:40] He's the one who gives everything.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; But you are not actually the one testing
[1:24:45] God. He's the one testing him.
[1:24:49] Amen.
[1:24:51] May God give us that revelation.
[1:24:56] Chapter 2 3.
[1:25:01] If you're there, say amen.
[1:25:04] If you don't have a Bible,
[1:25:08] come and see see us. If you can't afford
[1:25:09] one, will help you to get one.
[1:25:14] I believe everyone should have a Bible.
[1:25:19] Amen. Happy to see uh you, Sister Fibbe.
[1:25:23] God bless you.
[1:25:25] Verse three says, "For this is good and
[1:25:27] acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:25:29] savior, who will have all men to be
[1:25:32] saved and to come unto the knowledge of
[1:25:35] the truth. For there is one God and one
[1:25:37] mediator between God and man, the man
[1:25:41] Christ Jesus, who gave himself for a
[1:25:44] rans who gave himself a ransom for all
[1:25:47] to be testified in due time.
[1:26:17] Amen.
[1:26:28] Amen. Amen. You may be seated.
[1:26:32] May the Lord bless the reading of his
[1:26:34] word.
[1:26:37] As usual, I'm requesting uh for your
[1:26:39] undivided attention.
[1:26:44] If possible, please test.
[1:26:48] Do not go out and come back.
[1:26:54] I am I don't consider myself a long
[1:26:56] preacher.
[1:26:59] I is that not so?
[1:27:03] Or maybe I should preach for you 3 hours
[1:27:05] today.
[1:27:09] I don't think I'm a long preacher.
[1:27:12] You should have said I meant to
[1:27:13] encourage you
[1:27:17] cuz I might feel that you're disagreeing
[1:27:24] brother. You you not interpreted that
[1:27:26] properly. agreeing.
[1:27:30] &gt;&gt; All right. Uh that's not proper
[1:27:32] interpretation but nonetheless we can
[1:27:34] continue. Uh I am on part 12 today.
[1:27:42] I feel we can talk about our true origin
[1:27:46] even for a year or more.
[1:27:52] It is a it keeps
[1:27:55] you know uh expanding.
[1:27:59] It keeps expanding. But this morning I'm
[1:28:01] going to speak to you on the restored
[1:28:03] relationship between man and God.
[1:28:14] The restored relationship between man
[1:28:16] and God.
[1:28:22] Amen.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; If you turn to your Bible
[1:28:28] in the book of Genesis,
[1:28:32] uh there is something that the Bible
[1:28:34] says there that is very significant
[1:28:39] right in the beginning of your Bible.
[1:28:43] Uh it says chapter
[1:28:53] All right, I'll just get it for you.
[1:28:56] I think chapter 1 vers 26.
[1:29:02] And God said,
[1:29:04] "Let us make man in our image,
[1:29:10] after our likeness,
[1:29:14] and let them have dominion over the fish
[1:29:16] of the sea, and over the f of the air,
[1:29:19] and over the cattle, and over all the
[1:29:21] earth, and over every creeping thing
[1:29:23] that creepeth upon the earth.
[1:29:40] So this man was created to do what?
[1:29:43] Everybody said to have dominion.
[1:29:47] So that man was to have dominion,
[1:29:51] not to suffer,
[1:29:54] not to go through trials and testings
[1:29:56] and sufferings.
[1:30:00] not to go through sin and failure.
[1:30:03] But the purpose that that man was
[1:30:06] created was to have dominion,
[1:30:12] to rule,
[1:30:14] that man that was created in the image
[1:30:16] of God.
[1:30:19] The purpose was
[1:30:21] that he may rule.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:26] Now
[1:30:29] if you look at vers 27,
[1:30:32] it says, "So God created man in his own
[1:30:36] image.
[1:30:42] Male and female created he them.
[1:30:48] And God blessed them. And God said unto
[1:30:52] them, Be fruitful and multiply.
[1:30:58] and replenish the earth
[1:31:01] and subdue it
[1:31:04] and have dominion
[1:31:07] over the fish of the sea, over the fowl
[1:31:10] of the air, and over the every living
[1:31:13] thing
[1:31:14] that moveth upon the earth.
[1:31:17] That was what man was supposed to
[1:31:20] accomplish.
[1:31:23] But you see,
[1:31:25] man could not accomplish that
[1:31:29] being in a fallen state.
[1:31:36] Are you following me? Man had to be in
[1:31:41] the image of God
[1:31:44] to be able to rule.
[1:31:47] Because you see, God is a king. God is a
[1:31:50] ruler. And if he's going to have
[1:31:53] anything in his image,
[1:31:58] it will have to be in the image and in
[1:32:00] the likeness of God.
[1:32:04] How many understanding what I'm saying?
[1:32:06] Because God is a ruler. Man would have
[1:32:09] to be a ruler.
[1:32:11] Because God is a subduer.
[1:32:16] Man had to subdue
[1:32:18] because man because God had dominion.
[1:32:22] over everything.
[1:32:24] His spirit that covers everywhere.
[1:32:28] Man had to be the same way. Man had to
[1:32:31] have dominion.
[1:32:33] Man had to have power.
[1:32:35] Man was given the earth.
[1:32:38] Let me put it this way. God created the
[1:32:41] earth
[1:32:43] out of nothing. Out of nothing. Out of
[1:32:47] the world.
[1:32:49] He created the earth.
[1:32:51] And then he put a little god on earth
[1:32:57] like him
[1:32:59] to rule over the earth.
[1:33:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Do you see
[1:33:06] what we call kings today?
[1:33:10] what we call emperors,
[1:33:14] what we call presidents,
[1:33:17] what we call prime ministers,
[1:33:20] queens,
[1:33:22] all these uh potent all these leaders,
[1:33:27] they are just uh let me put it this way,
[1:33:30] they
[1:33:31] they are not the original.
[1:33:38] I hope you're following me this morning.
[1:33:40] They are mimicking our authority.
[1:33:49] Are you following me? Whatever you see
[1:33:52] happening in the world
[1:33:55] of all the leaders of the world
[1:33:58] because remember
[1:34:00] it was not God's will
[1:34:04] for Israel to get a king.
[1:34:07] He wanted to be the king of Israel.
[1:34:10] But when they got a king, when they
[1:34:12] demanded for a king, God said, "You have
[1:34:16] rejected me.
[1:34:18] It's all right. You have rejected. Let
[1:34:21] them have kings. They will make them
[1:34:23] suffer.
[1:34:25] They will kill them. They will persecute
[1:34:28] them. They will steal from them. They
[1:34:30] will do this and that." And that's what
[1:34:32] happens.
[1:34:34] When you see the the rulers of today,
[1:34:37] the politicians of today,
[1:34:39] They are the ones who steal people's
[1:34:41] lands.
[1:34:42] Is that correct? They're the ones who
[1:34:44] kill people. Is that correct? They're
[1:34:48] the ones who do all sorts of injustices.
[1:34:52] And many times
[1:35:07] that the way that the leadership of the
[1:35:10] world is
[1:35:14] is not in the form that it was supposed
[1:35:18] to be in.
[1:35:23] is not controlled by the people that
[1:35:25] were intended to have it.
[1:35:31] The ones that are having the authority
[1:35:33] today,
[1:35:35] they are not the rightful hairs of that
[1:35:38] authority.
[1:35:41] That's why they're making the world go
[1:35:43] through what is going through. Why?
[1:35:45] Because brother Bham preached a message
[1:35:47] and he titled it Saturny's Eden.
[1:35:53] All politics, all governments of the
[1:35:55] world today,
[1:35:58] now tie your belt for this are all
[1:36:02] controlled by Satan.
[1:36:11] telling them
[1:36:13] he took Jesus in a high place and he
[1:36:17] told him bow before me and look at all
[1:36:22] the nations
[1:36:23] the world
[1:36:25] he said is all mine
[1:36:28] just bow before me and I will give you
[1:36:33] everything you see I'll give you Uganda
[1:36:37] I'll give you America I'll give you
[1:36:39] Russia I'll give you all mine
[1:36:41] The devil is claiming it as his.
[1:36:45] That is why the politics as we know it
[1:36:49] today
[1:36:51] most politicians
[1:36:54] I am not saying all I don't know but for
[1:36:58] what I know most politicians
[1:37:02] use witchcraft.
[1:37:06] The devil hands them power.
[1:37:11] to go and rule, to go and control the
[1:37:14] government.
[1:37:16] Right now, we in the season of election.
[1:37:19] I was seeing an article on the internet
[1:37:21] yesterday.
[1:37:23] And you know, someone was interviewing
[1:37:25] which doctors
[1:37:27] and I was saying yes, this is the
[1:37:28] season.
[1:37:30] They all coming and we are giving them
[1:37:33] power
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; to go and and and make the people just
[1:37:38] forget about the right things and and
[1:37:40] and not go against them.
[1:37:48] So you just see people
[1:37:52] we are supporting our man. Why are you
[1:37:54] supporting your
[1:37:57] support?
[1:38:00] They are under a spell.
[1:38:04] &gt;&gt; A spell.
[1:38:08] It's not because and and you know voting
[1:38:10] is okay
[1:38:12] if you don't vote someone because is
[1:38:15] your tribe met
[1:38:18] because he looks good. He talks well.
[1:38:23] You vote principles. Someone who is
[1:38:26] standing for principles that you believe
[1:38:27] in.
[1:38:33] It doesn't matter who he is. As long as
[1:38:36] what he stands for
[1:38:38] is at least closer to what we stand for.
[1:38:43] But you see the governments of this
[1:38:45] world are all representing the the the
[1:38:50] evil prince.
[1:38:53] They are controlled by the devil himself
[1:38:57] and that's why you know you've seen all
[1:38:59] the things that have been happening over
[1:39:01] there
[1:39:03] people killing each other you know you
[1:39:06] are seeing even what is happening in the
[1:39:08] Middle East in Ukraine in Russia all
[1:39:11] these countries Syria why because the
[1:39:15] world is all perverted
[1:39:19] you know the Bible says all nature is
[1:39:21] growing
[1:39:23] They're waiting for something.
[1:39:26] They're waiting for the manifestation
[1:39:31] of the sons of God.
[1:39:34] Who are the sons of God? They are the
[1:39:36] true rulers of
[1:39:39] Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:39:41] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you brothers and sisters, we
[1:39:43] shall have domains
[1:39:47] right now. We have domains spiritually.
[1:39:52] We are in heavenly places.
[1:39:54] We are exercising our authority
[1:39:57] spiritually speaking.
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; But Amen. There is coming a time when we
[1:40:03] are physically
[1:40:06] going to rule over the world.
[1:40:09] The Bible says, Amen. When the Lord
[1:40:12] rules the world with the Lord of
[1:40:15] he will not be alone.
[1:40:18] He will be with the 10,000 of his
[1:40:20] saints.
[1:40:22] You and I together
[1:40:24] with him ruling this world.
[1:40:28] Oh, praise the Lord.
[1:40:32] You know the Bible speaks about the
[1:40:35] Armageddon
[1:40:38] which will be concluding the the third
[1:40:40] world war
[1:40:43] which is actually the conclusion of the
[1:40:45] third world war.
[1:40:48] But you see, it is the Lord that stops
[1:40:49] it.
[1:40:51] It is the Lord that stops that that
[1:40:53] causes it to seize
[1:40:56] when he comes down riding on a white
[1:40:59] horse.
[1:41:01] I knew they wanted to kill him
[1:41:05] and then uh you know he consumed all of
[1:41:08] them
[1:41:10] with a sword out of his mouth.
[1:41:13] with his word he will consume all the
[1:41:15] armies of the world.
[1:41:18] Imagine when they are all going to to
[1:41:20] hit Israel
[1:41:23] and then they all of a sudden see.
[1:41:26] Now this is not spiritual.
[1:41:28] This is physical.
[1:41:31] They will see
[1:41:33] him coming down in the brightness of his
[1:41:36] glory.
[1:41:40] Aliens have come over the world. See,
[1:41:43] remember this is long after the rapture.
[1:41:49] So now the ones they're calling aliens
[1:41:54] are Jesus Christ.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; But remember the Bible says he was not
[1:41:59] coming alone.
[1:42:01] He said behind him as he was riding on a
[1:42:05] on a on a cloud
[1:42:07] on a white horse. behind him where
[1:42:14] riding along with him.
[1:42:17] Where were they going? They were coming
[1:42:20] down back again
[1:42:22] to take over.
[1:42:25] Hallelujah. What are they coming to do?
[1:42:28] They are coming down to establish a
[1:42:31] kingdom
[1:42:33] which has never existed.
[1:42:36] &gt;&gt; When Jesus was in Jerusalem,
[1:42:39] They asked him a question. Have you come
[1:42:42] to restore the kingdom?
[1:42:45] That's the one they were talking about
[1:42:48] because they know he there was supposed
[1:42:51] to come one.
[1:42:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. That would continue
[1:42:56] the the throne of David, the kingdom of
[1:42:58] David,
[1:43:01] a kingdom with no end.
[1:43:04] and they expected that he was the one
[1:43:05] they suspected
[1:43:08] the way he's talking and the authority
[1:43:10] he had. He seems to be like the one they
[1:43:14] are right. He was the one and that was
[1:43:17] not the
[1:43:20] he had not gathered a bride yet.
[1:43:23] He had not restored the relationship
[1:43:27] between man and God
[1:43:30] which would bring the bride into view.
[1:43:35] So he he he told them no but you see
[1:43:40] that time was going to come
[1:43:42] and that's the time when he will come
[1:43:45] down
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; and he will establish
[1:43:49] his headquarters
[1:43:51] in Jerusalem.
[1:43:52] Hallelujah.
[1:43:56] And there will be a a city
[1:44:00] &gt;&gt; that he will literally rule out of.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Someone one time asked me said the
[1:44:07] tribulation is going to destroy
[1:44:08] everything.
[1:44:12] So who are we ruling over?
[1:44:15] We are ruling over people.
[1:44:17] Where did they come from? There are some
[1:44:20] people
[1:44:21] who survived the tribulation.
[1:44:26] The Bible talks about them and they
[1:44:28] multiply as a sand of the sea.
[1:44:33] They will multiply
[1:44:36] and some on the North Pole and the South
[1:44:38] Pole
[1:44:41] and and and they they will come out
[1:44:45] &gt;&gt; after the the the war
[1:44:48] and they will realize
[1:44:50] the world has changed.
[1:44:55] Everything is destroyed.
[1:44:58] Some people have acted movies out of
[1:45:00] this.
[1:45:05] Some of you might have watched some of
[1:45:06] those.
[1:45:08] It's biblical
[1:45:10] and they will see the world has changed.
[1:45:13] I was thinking how will they survive? I
[1:45:16] believe some of these who will survive.
[1:45:20] We are the millionaires today
[1:45:24] because they are the ones who will
[1:45:25] afford nuclear bankers.
[1:45:32] So they will escape and hide it.
[1:45:35] So they will come out only to see the
[1:45:38] world has changed
[1:45:41] and by the time they see the world has
[1:45:43] changed
[1:45:45] and they multiply when we come down they
[1:45:48] rule over these very people.
[1:45:52] So the rich of the world today
[1:45:56] they will become the maya of the sea
[1:46:00] and we will rule over them because we
[1:46:02] are the true rulers.
[1:46:05] of this world
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; and he will establish his kingdom
[1:46:10] and um you know his reign with with no
[1:46:13] end.
[1:46:15] We know that that will be the millennium
[1:46:19] and we will be together with him. Now
[1:46:22] this is before the the the the white
[1:46:25] throne judgment.
[1:46:30] Judgement happens after
[1:46:35] after the millennia.
[1:46:38] There will be those who will who will
[1:46:40] stand before the white throne
[1:46:44] to be judged according to their works.
[1:46:49] There will be those
[1:46:52] who will not stand before the Lord
[1:46:55] because they are already judged
[1:46:59] when when they were still on earth.
[1:47:04] They were judged by the word
[1:47:07] and they received the word. They
[1:47:09] accepted they were condemned
[1:47:12] and then sovereign grace took on.
[1:47:16] So the Bible now says there is no more
[1:47:18] judgment for
[1:47:22] are already in Christ.
[1:47:24] They have already passed from death to
[1:47:26] life.
[1:47:28] I believe right now, right now, not in
[1:47:31] the future. Right now, I am one of those
[1:47:35] people.
[1:47:37] Hallelujah. These ones, their
[1:47:39] relationship with God
[1:47:42] has already been restored.
[1:47:45] They don't need to go before the
[1:47:49] Have you heard someone say all of us we
[1:47:52] shall stand before the world?
[1:47:55] No.
[1:47:57] All of us including who
[1:48:00] me will not be among them.
[1:48:03] Apostle Paul said we shall all come
[1:48:05] before the judgment seat of Christ.
[1:48:10] He's not talking about the white throne
[1:48:11] judgment.
[1:48:14] He's talking about the judgment seat
[1:48:17] that's going to happen in the rapture.
[1:48:36] You see what I I usually call that
[1:48:40] I usually call it crowning ceremony
[1:48:47] giving ranks
[1:48:49] giving it's a ranking ceremony.
[1:48:53] It's not judgment unto condemnation.
[1:48:56] It is accountability time.
[1:49:00] Even when you're a believer, you will
[1:49:01] give accountability.
[1:49:05] How you lived your life,
[1:49:07] how you used everything that came to
[1:49:08] you,
[1:49:10] how you used your money, how you used
[1:49:12] your life, how you lived in this world,
[1:49:16] how you you you you presented yourself.
[1:49:20] You see, that will determine what kind
[1:49:21] of glory you will have
[1:49:26] when you get over there. So even when we
[1:49:28] come back to earth
[1:49:30] meaning we shall have different glories
[1:49:35] maybe some will be will be bigger kings
[1:49:38] than others
[1:49:41] others counter chiefs
[1:49:48] depending on how they live.
[1:49:52] But one thing for sure, you can debate
[1:49:55] about all that. But one thing for sure,
[1:49:58] an elect of God can never be lost.
[1:50:02] Can never be lost. So I am not going to
[1:50:05] be among those who will stand before the
[1:50:07] Lord.
[1:50:10] I will stand behind with the Lord
[1:50:12] and I will be the one judging together
[1:50:14] with you.
[1:50:18] The bride will judge together with you.
[1:50:23] You will judge
[1:50:25] the angels.
[1:50:27] You will judge all the other people
[1:50:30] that refuse to believe.
[1:50:33] But friends, I tell you, that's a
[1:50:35] marvelous time.
[1:50:38] If you think these things are not true,
[1:50:41] don't worry. You will get there.
[1:50:45] And when you get there, say, "Oh,
[1:50:48] there are certain things you can never
[1:50:49] debate about.
[1:50:52] As long as the Bible says it, we can
[1:50:55] only believe it.
[1:50:58] Amen.
[1:51:00] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:51:03] Now,
[1:51:04] this morning, I'm speaking about the the
[1:51:08] relationship between man and God.
[1:51:12] When man sin, that relationship was cut
[1:51:17] because death means total separation.
[1:51:23] Man was now separated with God.
[1:51:27] There was no more relationship.
[1:51:30] There was no more uh that that kind of
[1:51:33] relationship they had like in the
[1:51:35] beginning.
[1:51:38] You remember the relationship they had?
[1:51:41] Man was in the image of God,
[1:51:44] creating like God could create
[1:51:46] having power of and to have dominion
[1:51:50] just like God had. But that cease to be
[1:51:54] when sin came in and we talked about the
[1:51:57] book. The title did when Adam sinned
[1:52:02] that title did went back to God.
[1:52:05] And so all of us
[1:52:08] are born in sin.
[1:52:10] All of us are born short of the glory.
[1:52:16] That glory we lost it.
[1:52:19] So we are born in sin.
[1:52:22] We come to the world speaking life.
[1:52:25] We suffer in this flesh. We go through
[1:52:28] problems and trials.
[1:52:32] But can I speak to someone?
[1:52:35] You are not meant to be like that.
[1:52:39] There is a better life.
[1:52:42] Tell your neighbor there is a better
[1:52:43] life.
[1:52:45] Some of you you even want to do good
[1:52:50] but you find as if there is desire to do
[1:52:53] good in you
[1:52:56] but it looks like you are in a prison.
[1:53:00] You know you cannot break out.
[1:53:03] Why? Because you are you are imprisoned
[1:53:05] by the way you were born.
[1:53:11] You are born in sin.
[1:53:13] You are born as a poor man,
[1:53:16] but yet you are the owner of everything.
[1:53:20] It's like a son of a king being born.
[1:53:24] But you see, raised in a family
[1:53:27] of poor people. And that's how we are.
[1:53:31] We were born in sin, but we are not
[1:53:34] sinners.
[1:53:36] We were born in defeat, but we are not
[1:53:38] defeated.
[1:53:40] We were born in trials and blessing.
[1:53:44] That does not define who we are.
[1:53:50] We are born with lust,
[1:53:53] lust of the flesh,
[1:53:56] lust of the eyes.
[1:53:58] Amen. The pride of life. But you see
[1:54:02] that does not define who we are.
[1:54:08] What defines us is the relationship we
[1:54:11] are.
[1:54:13] In the beginning
[1:54:15] &gt;&gt; with our father.
[1:54:17] Hallelujah.
[1:54:18] &gt;&gt; Why you can't accept it
[1:54:21] is because of the conditions around
[1:54:25] is because of what you are seeing and
[1:54:28] what others are seeing.
[1:54:30] Why they couldn't accept that Jesus was
[1:54:34] a son of God is because of the way he
[1:54:36] was born.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; He was born
[1:54:42] without a clear mother and father
[1:54:47] out of wedlock
[1:54:51] and they are not even sure whether
[1:54:54] Joseph was the right one
[1:54:59] and he's even born in a very poor place
[1:55:05] Nazareth
[1:55:07] until people say can anything good come
[1:55:10] from Nazareth
[1:55:13] No one could believe
[1:55:16] Jesus said he was what he said he was.
[1:55:23] Even those who try to believe it, they
[1:55:26] try to believe it secretly.
[1:55:30] It was a shame
[1:55:32] because of the condition around him.
[1:55:36] And when he came among the the the
[1:55:38] Pharisees,
[1:55:40] they said, "Who do you think you are?
[1:55:43] Who do you say you are?"
[1:55:46] And then he said,
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; we read that in John last time for
[1:55:50] you know many words they exchanged.
[1:55:53] And part of those words
[1:55:55] the Pharisees versus Jesus.
[1:55:59] They said our father is Abraham.
[1:56:03] Jesus said oh your father is Abraham.
[1:56:06] Okay, let me tell you something.
[1:56:09] Your father Abraham,
[1:56:11] the one you claimed to be your father is
[1:56:14] not your father.
[1:56:16] He said, "Why?" Because you are not
[1:56:19] believing me.
[1:56:21] Your father Abraham
[1:56:24] believed me. He rejoiced to see my day.
[1:56:30] And when he saw it, he was glad.
[1:56:34] And he even said I'll tell you something
[1:56:36] else. Before Abraham
[1:56:40] I am. They said no that's
[1:56:44] now we know you have demons in
[1:56:49] they now say is demon possessed.
[1:56:53] That's the what the world saw about
[1:56:56] they couldn't understand the
[1:56:58] relationship between the son.
[1:57:02] Hallelujah. Are you following me?
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; But who was Jesus? He was a son of God.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; He was the Bible says born the Christ.
[1:57:18] He said because you don't believe me
[1:57:22] and you don't believe I am who I say I
[1:57:24] am,
[1:57:27] I will also tell you your origin.
[1:57:32] You are of your father the devil
[1:57:36] the works of your father you do
[1:57:39] they said ah
[1:57:42] my friend for us
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; we were not born out of fornication
[1:57:48] and they could dress their lineage
[1:57:54] down to Abraham
[1:57:57] last time I read it for you their
[1:57:59] lineage
[1:58:02] were Israelites
[1:58:05] by birth
[1:58:07] which means they came from Abraham
[1:58:09] directly.
[1:58:13] That was their origin.
[1:58:16] But because they refused to believe
[1:58:19] the origin of Jesus, he told them your
[1:58:22] father is not Abraham.
[1:58:25] Your father is Sat.
[1:58:27] Why? because you would have believed me.
[1:58:31] Now we love reading the Bible
[1:58:34] as a book of history.
[1:58:36] Please my my friends, can we bring it
[1:58:39] out of history
[1:58:42] and bring it here today
[1:58:45] 2025?
[1:58:48] Hallelujah. Amen. There is another
[1:58:51] relationship.
[1:58:55] Hallelujah. between the true sons of God
[1:58:59] and God himself.
[1:59:02] That relationship was removed by sin.
[1:59:07] But the Bible says, you know, God, there
[1:59:10] is one God and one mediator
[1:59:14] between God and men,
[1:59:17] between God and me, between God and you.
[1:59:21] That's the man Christ Jesus.
[1:59:25] What did Jesus come to do?
[1:59:27] He came to bring the relationship back
[1:59:30] again.
[1:59:33] He came to bring the relationship back
[1:59:35] again.
[1:59:38] That means when Jesus come there will be
[1:59:43] a people once again
[1:59:45] that are in the image of God.
[1:59:48] There will be people once again
[1:59:51] that have dominion
[1:59:53] like it was before the fall. There will
[1:59:56] be people once again that are ruling
[2:00:01] like they were supposed to do in the
[2:00:02] first place.
[2:00:05] There will be sons
[2:00:07] because they have come out of God.
[2:00:10] Now today where are those people? There
[2:00:14] are people who will believe every word.
[2:00:20] Let me remove my code so I can preach
[2:00:22] this very well.
[2:00:28] Sometimes we dress very smart and then
[2:00:30] when we come here we get messed up.
[2:00:35] Sometimes I say I will not remove my
[2:00:36] coat.
[2:00:38] But when the anointing become
[2:00:40] let me throw it out.
[2:00:43] Hallelujah.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; There are people on this earth
[2:00:48] that are not going to be defined my
[2:00:51] circumstances around them.
[2:00:53] Amen. It doesn't matter what people are
[2:00:55] saying about them.
[2:00:57] It doesn't matter what they feel about
[2:00:59] themselves. His people will receive a
[2:01:02] revelation
[2:01:04] who they truly are
[2:01:07] where they truly come from. Amen. What
[2:01:10] are they
[2:01:12] sons of God? Amen. The Bible says,
[2:01:14] brother Marvin, beloved, now
[2:01:19] tell your neighbor now.
[2:01:21] Come on, tell your neighbor now.
[2:01:24] Oh, now
[2:01:27] are we the sons?
[2:01:29] Now are you the son of God?
[2:01:33] Not tomorrow. Now. Now. Now. What does
[2:01:38] it mean?
[2:01:39] You have already been restored.
[2:01:43] That's an announcement.
[2:01:45] He's announcing to you. You are already
[2:01:48] restored back
[2:01:51] because the mediator has come down.
[2:01:54] The mediator has come down and he has
[2:01:57] stood between the bridge.
[2:02:01] Hallelujah. And he has breached
[2:02:04] this gap. There is no more gap between
[2:02:07] you and your father. So what is your
[2:02:10] origin?
[2:02:12] Your origin is gone.
[2:02:16] Let me tell you this is the message we
[2:02:19] are going to keep preaching
[2:02:22] until finally even our body has no
[2:02:25] choice
[2:02:27] but to be translated
[2:02:30] one day friends this may seem like a
[2:02:33] story.
[2:02:34] It may seem sometimes like a good sermon
[2:02:38] but there is a day I can assure you and
[2:02:41] that may be next morning. Amen. That may
[2:02:44] be any time from now when our body are
[2:02:47] going to be translated.
[2:02:50] And then the first thing you will think
[2:02:54] why did I worry?
[2:02:57] Why did I worry?
[2:02:59] Why not my sister?
[2:03:02] Why not my brother? Because your future
[2:03:05] is clear
[2:03:08] by the spoken word.
[2:03:12] Hallelujah.
[2:03:14] I feel some are not yet getting it.
[2:03:18] But don't worry, you'll get it.
[2:03:21] Oh, may God touch your voice today.
[2:03:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; The bridge. Let us read in the bridge
[2:03:26] today. Amen.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; Now, not as some people has taught it.
[2:03:33] I was hearing a man teach this one time.
[2:03:35] He said John wept because that he found
[2:03:37] himself not worthy.
[2:03:45] You know your John is a type of the
[2:03:46] bride.
[2:03:49] Oh, any man under the Holy Spirit would
[2:03:52] not different from that.
[2:03:56] Under the inspiration of God would not
[2:03:58] different from that.
[2:04:01] But John wept.
[2:04:03] Here is what I think he wept for.
[2:04:06] Because if no one was worthy
[2:04:12] and could open this book of redemption,
[2:04:17] the whole creation was long.
[2:04:23] Remember the one I've read about here
[2:04:26] in the book of Timothy is the the
[2:04:29] mediator
[2:04:31] is the one that was worthy. Right?
[2:04:34] &gt;&gt; We are coming down to eat. But John was
[2:04:37] weeping because if if no one was worthy,
[2:04:40] it means to open the book, it means the
[2:04:43] whole creation would be lost.
[2:04:56] Am I talking to the bride of Christ?
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. If I preach these things in
[2:05:02] a Pentecostal church, many of them would
[2:05:03] just look at me not knowing what I'm
[2:05:04] talking about.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; But you are not only Pentecostals. You
[2:05:11] are Pentecostals by experience.
[2:05:15] Amen. Here is the book. Here is the
[2:05:18] title did. And it would be offered to
[2:05:20] the kinsman redeemer that can meet the
[2:05:22] qualifications.
[2:05:24] He's talking about the book. He says,
[2:05:25] "Here's the book."
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Would be offered to the kinsman
[2:05:30] redeemer that can meet the
[2:05:31] qualifications.
[2:05:35] That is God's own law.
[2:05:42] A kinsman
[2:05:44] had to be related with the victim.
[2:05:52] Are you following
[2:05:55] by blood's
[2:05:58] man?
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; According to God's law. So the book
[2:06:06] cannot be handed back to Adam
[2:06:09] because he has sinned.
[2:06:12] But there are needed to be a kinsman
[2:06:15] redeemer.
[2:06:19] that can meet the qualification.
[2:06:23] You see, God required a kinsman with
[2:06:26] him.
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; The one that was worthy, the one that
[2:06:30] was able to do it, who had the
[2:06:34] substance.
[2:06:37] Amen. Who had the money?
[2:06:40] Who had the ability
[2:06:42] to redeem?
[2:06:44] Amen. And the angel said, "Now let the
[2:06:49] king's man redeemer a step forward
[2:06:58] and John looked." He waited for the
[2:07:01] king's man. He looked all over the
[2:07:04] earth. He looked beneath the earth and
[2:07:07] there was nobody
[2:07:11] there. The creation and everything was
[2:07:13] lost.
[2:07:16] and John wept.
[2:07:18] &gt;&gt; Everything was lost.
[2:07:21] His crying did not last but just a
[2:07:24] minute though.
[2:07:28] There stood one of the elders.
[2:07:31] And he said, "Don't weep John."
[2:07:34] Oh my. His cry didn't last but minute.
[2:07:39] John s. Oh my. Where is the man? Where
[2:07:42] is the man?
[2:07:43] Where is the kinsman redeemed? There
[2:07:46] stands the prophets. They were born like
[2:07:48] I was
[2:07:51] there. The sages
[2:07:54] and there is nobody else.
[2:07:57] No one able to redeem.
[2:08:00] Let me put it this way. Did you know no
[2:08:03] one can redeem you including your
[2:08:05] pastor,
[2:08:09] including your prophet?
[2:08:12] That is why.
[2:08:14] We do not follow a man.
[2:08:19] There is no man can redeem us.
[2:08:23] There is no holy man can redeem us.
[2:08:27] Elijah cannot.
[2:08:29] Jeremiah, Daniel, you know, William
[2:08:32] Brana.
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; These are prophets, but they could not,
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; they did not have the substance.
[2:08:39] They did not have the requirement
[2:08:42] of the law.
[2:08:44] Are you following me? Yes, they were our
[2:08:47] kinsmen,
[2:08:49] but they could not be the redeemer
[2:08:53] because they were sinners just like you.
[2:08:59] But then he says here, I want a man that
[2:09:02] is able to do it.
[2:09:04] I want a man that can redeem.
[2:09:07] And he found he wasn't found. So John
[2:09:10] broke out
[2:09:13] and everything was lost
[2:09:16] and he wept bitterly
[2:09:18] and he he was sad because everything the
[2:09:22] whole creation was gone.
[2:09:26] They couldn't find somebody.
[2:09:28] But then he says, "Glory to God.
[2:09:32] If they couldn't find somebody
[2:09:34] that can meet the requirement,
[2:09:37] every human being and the whole earth
[2:09:39] and creation was gone.
[2:09:46] We were lost. Everything had fallen.
[2:09:50] the rights of redemption,
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; the rights of eternal life,
[2:09:57] the light.
[2:09:59] And these rights had been for fated.
[2:10:04] And there was nobody who could pay the
[2:10:07] price.
[2:10:11] Listen, listen, listen. Sometimes the
[2:10:13] reason why we read these things,
[2:10:16] &gt;&gt; it's not because we can't just say it,
[2:10:18] but we want to give you the hunger,
[2:10:21] go back and read for yourself.
[2:10:24] We want you to hear.
[2:10:26] &gt;&gt; There is honey in the rock, my brother.
[2:10:31] There is honey in the rock for you.
[2:10:35] Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:10:37] Listen. And John started crying because
[2:10:41] there was no one worthy and no one could
[2:10:43] even look at the book. It took a human
[2:10:45] being. John wept because no one could do
[2:10:50] it and everything was lost.
[2:10:59] And there came a voice from one of the
[2:11:00] elders standing in the midst of the four
[2:11:02] beasts.
[2:11:05] And all that great host of heaven said,
[2:11:09] Don't weep jo
[2:11:13] of God.
[2:11:15] Don't be brokenhearted John.
[2:11:18] Who is John? John is a type of the
[2:11:21] bride.
[2:11:23] And I can also tell you my brother.
[2:11:26] Don't be brokenhearted.
[2:11:31] There is a redeemer.
[2:11:33] There is somebody that is worthy.
[2:11:36] Don't we
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; for the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[2:11:42] &gt;&gt; the root and offspring of David,
[2:11:45] he has prevailed.
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; There is only one God
[2:11:51] and one mediator
[2:11:53] between God and man,
[2:11:55] the man
[2:11:58] Christ Jesus.
[2:12:00] That's the redeemer we are talking
[2:12:01] about.
[2:12:03] Why was he a man?
[2:12:05] because he had to be your brother
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; to be able to redeem you. He can only be
[2:12:11] a king's man.
[2:12:14] &gt;&gt; Oh, someone did not get it.
[2:12:17] The man Christ Jesus
[2:12:21] that it had to be a man.
[2:12:24] God became man.
[2:12:27] You will get it sooner. Prevail
[2:12:30] means
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; wrestle with and overcome.
[2:12:37] Oh my. The garden of Gethsemane.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; When blood dropped down out of his face.
[2:12:45] What was he doing? He was overcoming.
[2:12:49] Do you think Oh my my my my.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; Do you think it was easy
[2:12:55] for Jesus?
[2:12:59] to die. Think about it for a moment. Let
[2:13:03] us think about it, church. Do you
[2:13:05] realize Jesus was a man
[2:13:08] like you,
[2:13:11] brother Enoch? Just like you.
[2:13:14] Imagine if they tell you.
[2:13:16] You are supposed to die for brother
[2:13:18] Julia.
[2:13:21] You love him, but you die
[2:13:26] by the way of the cross.
[2:13:28] They put nails in your arms
[2:13:32] and they put you on the cross.
[2:13:35] That is the hardest.
[2:13:38] Please, I want you to understand. Jesus
[2:13:41] was a man like you and me.
[2:13:43] He had a will like you and me.
[2:13:46] He had desires like you and me.
[2:13:50] He had a flesh.
[2:13:53] &gt;&gt; He had fear.
[2:13:55] When he went to cry,
[2:13:58] he pray. The Bible says he prayed until
[2:14:02] blood dropped from him.
[2:14:07] It was not easy.
[2:14:11] He labored.
[2:14:14] He cried it out.
[2:14:17] That's what overcoming means.
[2:14:21] &gt;&gt; He has prevailed.
[2:14:24] Prevailing means he wrestled and he
[2:14:27] overcame.
[2:14:31] Jesus wrestled with the flesh.
[2:14:34] He wrestled with his own will.
[2:14:37] He wrestled with his own fears.
[2:14:41] He swatted it out.
[2:14:44] He prayed it away.
[2:14:47] He said, "Father,
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; take this cup from me."
[2:14:52] He wished it away.
[2:14:55] He did not want to die, sister.
[2:14:59] He wanted to live like you and I.
[2:15:02] But in the end,
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; but in the end,
[2:15:07] he was worthy
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; because
[2:15:11] he successfully overcame.
[2:15:15] And when he was on the cross,
[2:15:18] he said, "It is finished.
[2:15:24] I have prevailed.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; I have prevailed. I have brided the gap.
[2:15:34] There is no more separation
[2:15:37] before the father and son.
[2:15:41] They are now resto
[2:15:44] again to their true identity.
[2:15:51] He was a man
[2:15:54] so we can overcome.
[2:15:57] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you my brother.
[2:15:58] Let me say something right here
[2:16:00] significant.
[2:16:03] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[2:16:05] and I always thought
[2:16:07] in the wrong way
[2:16:10] but hear it now.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Jesus did not overcome as God.
[2:16:26] &gt;&gt; Do you get it?
[2:16:28] Did you get it? He did not overcome as
[2:16:32] God.
[2:16:37] Jesus did overcome as God.
[2:16:41] He wanted to overcome as
[2:16:44] he wouldn't have put on flesh.
[2:16:49] Hallelujah. Amen. Why did he put on
[2:16:51] flesh?
[2:16:52] He needed to overcome
[2:16:55] as a man. Why? Because he took your
[2:17:00] place.
[2:17:04] He overcame as a man. And there is only
[2:17:07] one reason
[2:17:10] why God
[2:17:11] put on flesh so that he can overcome
[2:17:15] and prevail
[2:17:17] and take the book. There is only one
[2:17:20] reason
[2:17:22] because there was somebody else
[2:17:25] going to overcome
[2:17:30] my my my
[2:17:32] hallelujah.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; Don't watch me preaching. Preach with me
[2:17:35] this morning.
[2:17:39] There was somebody else
[2:17:41] going to overcome
[2:17:43] because the Bible says to they that
[2:17:46] overcome, to that overcome, they will
[2:17:49] sit with me on my throne. To they that
[2:17:52] overcome will eat of the tree of life.
[2:17:56] To they that overcome in every
[2:17:58] generation.
[2:18:00] There are overcomers,
[2:18:05] brother. Amen. Listen to this. Amen.
[2:18:07] These overcomers
[2:18:09] are not going to overcome as men.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; I know you missed that one for sure.
[2:18:19] So let me expound.
[2:18:22] Why did he overcome as a man?
[2:18:25] So we can overcome
[2:18:31] God. Hallelujah. In flesh.
[2:18:46] Yes sir. So that I can overcome.
[2:18:50] I can't overcome.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; As Julius you can't overcome.
[2:18:56] Come on. You can't overcome. As
[2:18:59] are you hearing me? Somebody fortunate
[2:19:01] to you as fortunate. Oh
[2:19:05] &gt;&gt; you are lost. you can overcome.
[2:19:08] In other words, legalism can't help you
[2:19:12] by doing things and doing that and doing
[2:19:14] this. You are trying to overcome by
[2:19:16] yourself as a human being
[2:19:19] your works of righteousness
[2:19:22] to God. They are filthy right
[2:19:24] because to begin with
[2:19:27] he came down because you were not able
[2:19:30] to overcome
[2:19:32] so he came. Oh, hallelujah. Come here,
[2:19:35] my brother. Hallelujah.
[2:19:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here you are.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; You are going to be Sorry, my brother.
[2:19:43] I'm using you this morning. You are
[2:19:45] going to be on the cross.
[2:19:48] You are going to be on a cross and so
[2:19:51] you. He said if he dies,
[2:19:56] they are all finished.
[2:19:58] I can't let my man die.
[2:20:03] This is my attribute.
[2:20:06] This is me manifested in flesh.
[2:20:09] I can't let him die.
[2:20:12] So the angel said, "Let us go and save
[2:20:14] him." He said, "You can't. You have no
[2:20:18] qualification.
[2:20:20] You have no requirement.
[2:20:23] You have no qualification.
[2:20:25] You are angels.
[2:20:27] But the one to save him must be his
[2:20:30] brother. The one to redeem him must be
[2:20:34] like he is but you are not. So shut up.
[2:20:39] Stay in your place. You can't do this
[2:20:43] job.
[2:20:45] So then what did he do? Hallelujah.
[2:20:49] Amen. Oh brother, don't you worry. The
[2:20:52] anointing will come upon you. You'll
[2:20:53] interpret up to the end. Just give him
[2:20:55] more sound. Right here my brother. I'll
[2:20:57] show you what happened. Was in your
[2:20:59] place. what he did. Are you listening to
[2:21:02] me? Are you listening to me? Here is
[2:21:05] what he did. He came just like a bread
[2:21:09] is coming to you. Just like a bread
[2:21:11] would be coming to you.
[2:21:14] &gt;&gt; He just came and said come
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; and he took your place.
[2:21:21] Hallelujah. He did not
[2:21:24] he did not he could not take your place
[2:21:28] as God.
[2:21:32] He had to put on flesh
[2:21:35] like yours
[2:21:38] so the bullet can go through here
[2:21:42] and then he removed you in the picture.
[2:21:46] He said, "I'll take your place
[2:21:49] so that you will no longer need to do
[2:21:53] what he did.
[2:22:05] because you could not do it anyhow.
[2:22:11] Oh, glory.
[2:22:17] Amen.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:19] &gt;&gt; So what did he do?
[2:22:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. He became man and he died so that
[2:22:27] he overcomes
[2:22:29] so that we will overcome
[2:22:32] as God.
[2:22:38] Your temptation was telling you
[2:22:41] you can't go through this. It is true.
[2:22:45] Tell the devil it is true.
[2:22:50] Peace. Peace. Do you think you can go
[2:22:52] through this? The precious rumor, you
[2:22:54] can
[2:22:56] don't struggle with the devil.
[2:22:58] Tell him certain is true.
[2:23:01] You are right. Tell him s amen.
[2:23:05] I can't go through it. I am so weak. I
[2:23:09] am so afraid. I don't have the
[2:23:11] requirements
[2:23:13] of your law. I'm telling but Satan,
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; listen to this. That's why Jesus came.
[2:23:22] Why did he die?
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. He prevailed
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; to take the book.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; And he has taken the book.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; He has taken the book.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; Why? because he was worthy.
[2:23:42] And then tell your your enemy,
[2:23:46] &gt;&gt; listen Satan,
[2:23:48] by him doing that,
[2:23:52] I gave him what I had. He gave me what
[2:23:54] he had.
[2:23:58] He became what I was. I became what he
[2:24:00] was.
[2:24:05] The Bible literally says
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; he became sin
[2:24:10] that I might become the righteousness of
[2:24:14] God.
[2:24:18] So who are you?
[2:24:20] You are the righteousness of God.
[2:24:25] Wait, I did not say you have the
[2:24:27] righteousness of God.
[2:24:31] Don't misinterpret scripture.
[2:24:34] I said you are.
[2:24:39] Do you see why the bride needs
[2:24:41] revelation?
[2:24:45] upon this rock, upon this revelation, I
[2:24:49] will build my church
[2:24:52] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[2:24:57] shall not overcome
[2:24:59] because the church has realized who she
[2:25:01] is.
[2:25:04] I am the righteousness of God.
[2:25:08] Tell two people, I am the righteousness
[2:25:11] of God.
[2:25:12] is
[2:25:13] &gt;&gt; I am the righteousness of God.
[2:25:17] Come on, give it a little shout and a
[2:25:19] clap of praise.
[2:25:28] So he must overcome in me.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; He must overcome in me.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; If I became him,
[2:25:38] it means I am no longer me.
[2:25:41] I am dead.
[2:25:43] &gt;&gt; I am dead.
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; And the life I live,
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; the life I live, Amen, is no longer mine
[2:25:50] is the life of God in me.
[2:25:53] That is the work of the Holy Spirit.
[2:25:58] Hallelujah.
[2:25:59] &gt;&gt; When I look at myself,
[2:26:02] I do not see how I can overcome.
[2:26:06] But when I look at him in me,
[2:26:12] I do not see how I can be lost.
[2:26:18] &gt;&gt; His life became mine.
[2:26:22] &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, preach with me this
[2:26:24] morning. His character became mine.
[2:26:28] I am holy even as he is.
[2:26:32] I am a conqueror even as he is
[2:26:35] because I am born of God.
[2:26:38] I must overcome.
[2:26:43] I must overcome.
[2:26:46] He dwelleth in me
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; in the form of the Holy Ghost
[2:26:51] to quicken me
[2:26:53] to remind me that I came from God. I go
[2:26:58] back to God to remind me the bridge the
[2:27:04] bridge
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; is removed.
[2:27:08] relationship
[2:27:09] has been restored.
[2:27:15] Woo! Hallelujah.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; And he said the lion of the tribe of
[2:27:20] Judah prevail.
[2:27:23] He said don't weep. Don't weep John for
[2:27:27] the lion of the tribe of Judah. The root
[2:27:29] of David
[2:27:31] has prevailed.
[2:27:33] He has already overcome.
[2:27:36] He has done it.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; It's over, John.
[2:27:41] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me, John? This morning,
[2:27:44] are you hearing me, John?
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; A New Testament preacher is a prophet.
[2:27:52] Don't hear this as a sermon.
[2:27:55] Hear it as a prophecy to you.
[2:27:58] It's over.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; It's over.
[2:28:04] is over.
[2:28:06] &gt;&gt; I still see it.
[2:28:07] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. It's over.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; Don't look at what you see because what
[2:28:14] you see is not real. But what you don't
[2:28:17] see is real is over John. He has
[2:28:22] prevailed. He has taken the book and he
[2:28:26] has revealed the mysteries.
[2:28:32] Amen. Oh my. He produced a bleach. A
[2:28:36] bleach.
[2:28:39] A bleach
[2:28:42] that sends sin
[2:28:45] a long way back to the greasy hands of
[2:28:48] Satan.
[2:28:55] Hallelujah.
[2:28:56] Hallelujah.
[2:28:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. But when John turned to look
[2:29:01] he so alarmed
[2:29:04] what are different from a lion.
[2:29:07] He said a lion has prevailed.
[2:29:11] See again I can use there God hiding in
[2:29:13] simplicity.
[2:29:16] He said there is a lion that's the king
[2:29:19] of the beast. The lion has prevailed.
[2:29:22] But he said John don't worry.
[2:29:26] Don't be broken up.
[2:29:28] And when I underlined these words
[2:29:30] because I felt the Holy Spirit was
[2:29:32] ministering to me
[2:29:34] and I want to emphasize them twice to
[2:29:36] you
[2:29:38] in the name of God speaking to someone
[2:29:39] here.
[2:29:42] Don't worry.
[2:29:44] Don't cry.
[2:29:46] Don't be broken up. Why was John
[2:29:49] worrying?
[2:29:50] Because of sin.
[2:29:53] Because he was over with sin.
[2:29:55] because he he was already on the other
[2:29:58] side of the ble of the bridge
[2:30:02] of the chasm. But then here, you know,
[2:30:05] brother,
[2:30:07] John, don't worry.
[2:30:10] Don't cry.
[2:30:12] Don't be broken up. John, I have you
[2:30:15] here in the vision.
[2:30:19] When I say John, I'm meaning you.
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; Hear your name.
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; I just heard my name, friends.
[2:30:34] Amen.
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; I have you here in a vision.
[2:30:38] I am showing you something.
[2:30:42] And I know you are all tore up
[2:30:46] because you know there is nothing to be
[2:30:48] redeemed.
[2:30:51] Everything is gone. There is nobody can
[2:30:54] meet a requirement
[2:30:57] but the lion.
[2:30:59] The lion of the tribe of Judah.
[2:31:03] That's what it's all about.
[2:31:06] That's what it's all about.
[2:31:08] None of us here
[2:31:12] even if we desired
[2:31:14] could redeem ourel
[2:31:19] each of us is mangled up and tore up and
[2:31:25] if they bring a screen
[2:31:28] and put it up here and put a life of
[2:31:31] everybody here
[2:31:34] one by one nobody would come back to
[2:31:36] church.
[2:31:40] What?
[2:31:45] Is that brother Martin?
[2:31:50] What?
[2:31:53] Is that the wife of the past?
[2:31:58] There is no salvation.
[2:32:04] But friends,
[2:32:05] because he knows,
[2:32:09] &gt;&gt; he knows that. Because he knows that,
[2:32:12] he said, "I'm not going to count it on
[2:32:14] your worthiness."
[2:32:19] Don't you ever let the devil corner you
[2:32:25] into a place where you think you are not
[2:32:28] worthy.
[2:32:31] Tell the devil, you are right. I have
[2:32:32] never been worthy.
[2:32:36] But there is one who is worthy.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; And that is my kinsman redeemer.
[2:32:42] He has prevailed.
[2:32:45] &gt;&gt; He prevailed as me.
[2:32:48] That I can prevail as him.
[2:32:55] I'm here to prevail. Not in myself,
[2:33:01] but in him.
[2:33:05] Don't let anything
[2:33:08] make you stop serving God.
[2:33:15] Don't let the flesh
[2:33:17] lie to you. Don't let your mind
[2:33:21] confuse you.
[2:33:25] We are here to prevail.
[2:33:28] The gates of hell shall not prevail.
[2:33:32] That is a prophecy.
[2:33:34] Our Lord himself,
[2:33:36] the redeemer,
[2:33:38] he said, "The gates of hell shall not
[2:33:40] prevail."
[2:33:43] So who is Satan?
[2:33:45] What does he think he can do
[2:33:48] that God has not already seen?
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:55] Hallelujah.
[2:33:56] And then Revelation 10,
[2:33:59] he came down with an open book
[2:34:04] in the right hand.
[2:34:06] Amen. This is the same one.
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; The same one, the redeemer came down
[2:34:13] with an open book
[2:34:16] in his right hand.
[2:34:18] Amen. And he set his right foot on the
[2:34:20] sea and and his left foot on the earth.
[2:34:24] and and and John. And when he cried out,
[2:34:28] you know, as a lion roar,
[2:34:32] out of his cry came seven thunders.
[2:34:37] And then when they had uttered their
[2:34:39] voices,
[2:34:42] John was going to pick a pen and
[2:34:46] you see the angel told him, "Sal up
[2:34:50] those things which the seven thunders
[2:34:52] asked.
[2:34:54] Do not write them,
[2:34:56] leave them alone. But on verse seven, he
[2:34:59] says, "But in the days of the voice,
[2:35:03] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[2:35:06] serve,
[2:35:08] the mystery of God should be faith,
[2:35:11] as he has declared to his servants, the
[2:35:12] prophet,
[2:35:15] there is there would come a time."
[2:35:18] Hallelujah.
[2:35:20] There would come a time
[2:35:22] in the end time
[2:35:25] when God will send a seventh angel
[2:35:27] messenger
[2:35:31] and he will blow his trumpet.
[2:35:34] Now I'm not talking about the seventh
[2:35:36] angel trumpeting angel. I'm talking
[2:35:37] about the seventh angel to the Gentiles
[2:35:45] and the seventh angel messenger
[2:35:49] has already let out shout.
[2:35:55] He says the mystery of this seven sealed
[2:35:57] book
[2:35:59] will be revealed at the sounding of the
[2:36:01] seventh church angels message.
[2:36:07] The seventh angel begins to sound
[2:36:11] and there is a message wrought out there
[2:36:13] and we got it on tape and book form.
[2:36:20] That message is here with us.
[2:36:23] If you are not feeling on it, you're
[2:36:25] doing a big mistake.
[2:36:29] We have the seventh angel's message.
[2:36:33] I said we have the message of the
[2:36:34] seventh angel
[2:36:37] in books and in tapes.
[2:36:40] We can read it. We can listen to it.
[2:36:43] Am I preaching to someone here this
[2:36:44] morning?
[2:36:46] And now the beginning of the sounding of
[2:36:47] the message.
[2:36:50] The mystery of God should be finished.
[2:36:54] Now remember, he did not say at the
[2:36:55] beginning when he will begin to preach,
[2:37:00] but at the sounding forth of the
[2:37:01] message.
[2:37:04] That message comes under the third phase
[2:37:05] of his ministry,
[2:37:09] not the first or second phase,
[2:37:12] not when he was performing the miracles.
[2:37:14] Not when he was doing designments and
[2:37:16] all that.
[2:37:19] But when he was preaching the message,
[2:37:24] the mystery of God should be finished.
[2:37:27] At that time, the book of the mystery of
[2:37:30] God is not revealed until the seventh
[2:37:32] angel message is sounded.
[2:37:36] It is a mysterious book. It's the book
[2:37:39] of redemption. We'll get into that a
[2:37:41] little while. Now, we know that this
[2:37:43] book of redemption will not be
[2:37:44] thoroughly understood.
[2:37:49] Give me about 15 minutes.
[2:37:52] It will not be thoroughly understood.
[2:37:55] is progged on through six church ages.
[2:38:01] But at the end
[2:38:04] when the seventh angel begins to sound
[2:38:06] his Christian,
[2:38:09] he winds up
[2:38:12] all of the loose end
[2:38:18] that all these fellows, the other
[2:38:20] messengers tried to prog.
[2:38:24] The mysteries will come down from God
[2:38:28] as the word of God and reveals the
[2:38:30] entire revelation of God.
[2:38:35] The Godhead and everything else is
[2:38:37] settled.
[2:38:39] All the mysteries serpent se whatever
[2:38:41] more is to be revealed. Now you see I'm
[2:38:44] not just making this up.
[2:38:47] It is thus saith the Lord.
[2:38:51] The book holds the mystery of the names.
[2:38:56] The names of those supposed to be saved.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; The book holds a mystery.
[2:39:07] The book is only unfolding it now.
[2:39:12] Not each one's name,
[2:39:16] but what the mystery of the book is.
[2:39:22] while it's calling those names.
[2:39:27] &gt;&gt; The book doesn't say
[2:39:31] &gt;&gt; fortunate
[2:39:36] Benjamin Benjamin.
[2:39:38] &gt;&gt; The book doesn't say that.
[2:39:40] &gt;&gt; But what does it say?
[2:39:42] &gt;&gt; The book reveals the mystery
[2:39:47] contained in there.
[2:39:50] And then
[2:39:51] by doing that
[2:39:54] it is calling the name.
[2:39:59] When you receive the revelation of the
[2:40:01] mystery,
[2:40:03] you have heard your name.
[2:40:09] It doesn't say leave veils to be saved
[2:40:11] in the time of the church age or my ne
[2:40:12] whatever. No, it doesn't say that. It
[2:40:14] just shows the mystery.
[2:40:21] It unfolds the mystery of what the thing
[2:40:23] is.
[2:40:27] But we ourselves by faith we believe it.
[2:40:36] Hallelujah.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:40:44] friends.
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Um, I normally do not go beyond this
[2:40:49] time,
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; but I've only just started on this.
[2:40:54] Maybe on Wednesday I can continue with
[2:40:56] it.
[2:40:58] I just like you to stand up on your
[2:40:59] feet.
[2:41:15] These things are real, friends.
[2:41:18] They're real and God is real and his
[2:41:21] word is real.
[2:41:24] I just pray that you open your heart
[2:41:26] every day and you know allow him to
[2:41:29] reveal himself to you.
[2:41:36] Amen. Brother, come up and help our
[2:41:37] brother.
[2:41:39] God bless you brother Henry. Hallelujah.
[2:41:46] You know we are living in a very
[2:41:49] a very difficult time
[2:41:56] where people no longer have the love of
[2:41:58] God.
[2:42:02] But where are you going to stand in this
[2:42:04] evil day?
[2:42:07] Where are you going to stand?
[2:42:09] Are you going to thirst after him?
[2:42:13] Is your heart going to pant after him?
[2:42:18] May God help you and may God help me
[2:42:23] that we may not allow the enemy to rob
[2:42:26] us
[2:42:29] and take away what is rightfully ours.
[2:42:36] It's a high time that brothers and
[2:42:38] sisters, we begin to seriously look at
[2:42:41] what our savior, our redeemer did for
[2:42:44] us.
[2:42:54] of fail.
[2:42:56] Amen.
[2:42:58] When you look at him,
[2:43:00] quit looking at yourself.
[2:43:04] Stop that. It's not helping.
[2:43:10] And the only way you can look at him
[2:43:14] is by giving yourself to study the word,
[2:43:20] giving yourself to pray.
[2:43:24] And then slowly by slowly the things of
[2:43:26] the world will begin to fade away.
[2:43:32] That's what each of us needs to do.
[2:43:39] Oh, may God help us to do that.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:47] I don't know if the brother has the
[2:43:48] words for to the song Jesus draw me
[2:43:51] close closer to thee, Lord. I don't know
[2:43:54] if the brothers know how to sing it and
[2:43:56] to play it, but I just feel like singing
[2:43:58] those few words and
[2:44:01] and I want you to listen to them and let
[2:44:04] it be your prayer as well. It's just a
[2:44:06] prayer of mine this morning.
[2:44:09] Jesus,
[2:44:11] draw
[2:44:12] me closer,
[2:44:18] closer
[2:44:19] to
[2:44:21] you, Lord.
[2:44:27] Let the world
[2:44:30] around me
[2:44:33] fade
[2:44:35] away.
[2:44:43] Jesus
[2:44:45] draw
[2:44:46] me close
[2:44:52] closer
[2:44:54] to you, Lord.
[2:45:01] Fade a while
[2:45:05] around me.
[2:45:08] Fade
[2:45:10] away.
[2:45:17] Sing it now if you can.
[2:45:20] Jesus
[2:45:22] draw
[2:45:24] me close.
[2:45:27] Oh,
[2:45:29] close our Lord
[2:45:33] to you.
[2:45:37] Oh, L
[2:45:42] around me and it fade
[2:45:47] away.
[2:45:51] Sing it again.
[2:45:53] Jesus Jesus
[2:45:56] draw
[2:45:57] me close
[2:46:06] to you.
[2:46:10] made a while.
[2:46:12] Let a world
[2:46:16] around me
[2:46:20] away.
[2:46:29] For I desire
[2:46:33] to worship
[2:46:36] and know me.
[2:46:43] Hallelujah.
[2:46:45] I desire to worship you, Jesus.
[2:46:48] I desire to obey you, oh God, and to
[2:46:51] follow your leadership all the step of
[2:46:53] the way.
[2:46:54] Oh, draw me close, oh Jesus. Draw me
[2:46:57] close. Why don't you tell him to draw
[2:46:59] close to you?
[2:47:02] Why don't you tell him to bring you
[2:47:04] close to him?
[2:47:07] Tell him, "Lord, draw me close.
[2:47:11] Let all the world around me
[2:47:16] fade away.
[2:47:18] Everything fed away.
[2:47:21] I just want to worship you in my life.
[2:47:24] I just want to live for you.
[2:47:28] I want to obey you, Jesus.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, help me Lord. Help me God. Help me,
[2:47:34] Lord. Help me, Lord.
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; Jesus,
[2:47:39] draw me close,
[2:47:47] close the Lord
[2:47:50] to you.
[2:47:56] Fade a world
[2:48:00] around
[2:48:01] me.
[2:48:03] Fade
[2:48:05] away.
[2:48:13] For I desire
[2:48:17] to a sheep
[2:48:20] and oy
[2:48:28] for I desire
[2:48:31] to worship
[2:48:34] and know me.
[2:48:42] Yes Jesus.
[2:48:44] Hallelujah. Sing as a deer pandeth after
[2:48:48] the waters. Hallelujah.
[2:49:00] My soul,
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; my soul.
[2:49:02] &gt;&gt; As long as I

[2:54:46] Oh,

[2:54:50] just surrender their life today. Can you
[2:54:53] reconsecrate yourself today as you
[2:54:54] worship the Lord everybody please? Oh,
