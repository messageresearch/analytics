[57:07] Amen. Amen. Let's give the Lord a clap
[57:09] of
[57:12] praise. Amen. I'd like to uh greet you
[57:15] all in the name of our Lord Jesus
[57:16] Christ.
[57:19] Just greet your neighbor, tell him or
[57:20] her, God bless
[57:38] you. All right. So
[57:41] um before you get seated we are going to
[57:43] read from the Bible in the book of
[57:45] Hebrews chapter
[57:58] 2.
[57:59] Vers 16.
[58:29] We are going to read from 16 to 18.
[58:38] For verily he took not on him the nature
[58:41] of angels, but he took on him the seed
[58:44] of Abraham. Wherefore in all things it
[58:47] behooved him to be made like unto his
[58:49] brethren, that he might be merciful and
[58:52] faithful high priest, that he be sorry,
[58:56] that he might be a merciful and faithful
[58:58] high priest in things pertaining to God
[59:01] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[59:04] the people. For in that he he himself
[59:08] has suffered being tempted, he is able
[59:11] to sar them that are tempted.
[59:27] [Music]
[59:31] That verse is what? 16. The translation
[59:35] here is a little different. Uh, is that
[59:37] Sorry. Can you read that again? I
[59:46] [Music]
[59:49] hear. No, that's wrong translation.
[59:52] Thank God for the message and also for
[59:55] the English Bible that we can be able to
[59:57] read ourselves.
[1:00:02] Okay. Now let let me just interpret this
[1:00:05] and then you will try verse 17 there.
[1:00:07] Amen. For verily he took on him the
[1:00:10] nature of angels.
[1:00:20] For verily he took not on him the nature
[1:00:23] of
[1:00:28] angels, but he took on him the seed of
[1:00:31] Abraham.
[1:00:35] All right. Um, can you read now verse
[1:00:38] 17?
[1:00:45] [Music]
[1:00:53] [Music]
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:09] Amen. God bless you. You may be
[1:01:12] seated. How many are happy to be in the
[1:01:14] house of the Lord tonight?
[1:01:18] Amen. Praise the Lord. It's always very
[1:01:21] good to be in the house of the
[1:01:23] Lord. Uh before we go into the word this
[1:01:26] evening, I just want to say this
[1:01:28] actually this um from last weekend I was
[1:01:31] supposed to be um
[1:01:36] [Music]
[1:01:38] away. I was actually supposed to be in
[1:01:40] in in Singapore that last
[1:01:44] weekend. We had arranged uh meetings
[1:01:49] there with pastor
[1:01:51] Dave and uh in Singapore.
[1:01:55] Uh it is it was unfortunate that we
[1:01:57] could not make the
[1:02:00] trip because I had to yet secure another
[1:02:04] another uh visa for another
[1:02:08] country which has delayed uh to come
[1:02:12] through. And so this evening I just want
[1:02:15] to bring you greetings from brother
[1:02:19] Gary. He he asked me to greet you.
[1:02:23] We are supposed to be with him and the
[1:02:24] saints in Brisbane this
[1:02:29] weekend for their Easter
[1:02:32] meetings. Um but we are yet still
[1:02:36] waiting on the response for for the visa
[1:02:39] to come.
[1:02:43] has taken longer than
[1:02:45] usual. So, we've had to reschedu for
[1:02:50] that and uh I I did not you know you
[1:02:54] planned but God usually has other
[1:02:57] plans. So, I was as I was asking the
[1:03:00] Lord, oh God, why like why did we plan
[1:03:03] it and you did not let it work out the
[1:03:05] way we had planned?
[1:03:10] And uh the answer I received was a call
[1:03:13] from
[1:03:17] Kenya pastor
[1:03:20] and he was asking me to go and be with
[1:03:22] them this
[1:03:24] Easter and uh I was like okay so this
[1:03:27] was your plan and I had other
[1:03:31] plans. So it turns out that instead of
[1:03:35] flying overseas we are going to go just
[1:03:37] um across the border.
[1:03:44] Um uh we will be with the saints in
[1:03:50] kaosi and um pastor has asked me also to
[1:03:54] go with I think there's one of the
[1:03:56] brothers who is going to be speaking at
[1:03:59] uh the meetings um um
[1:04:03] uh at speckled
[1:04:09] Yeah, I do not know him but I think his
[1:04:11] name is brother Keith.
[1:04:15] So we shall be taking those meetings in
[1:04:17] Kaos
[1:04:18] [Music]
[1:04:20] City Saturday early morning I think
[1:04:23] he'll be preaching here um either
[1:04:29] tomorrow and then I'll be uh driving
[1:04:31] with him uh to Kimosi
[1:04:36] where we shall be for the rest of the
[1:04:40] weekend. So, um but I I believe that the
[1:04:44] rest of you who are not going to be
[1:04:45] traveling with
[1:04:48] me are planning to be at the meet at the
[1:04:51] convention
[1:04:54] here that is a Thursday. I think they
[1:04:56] have the first service beginning at
[1:04:58] around
[1:05:00] 6 and then uh the the rest of the
[1:05:03] services on on Friday.
[1:05:07] Please be there.
[1:05:09] You know, seeing all the the ministers
[1:05:13] that are gathered, you know, coming from
[1:05:15] different parts of the
[1:05:19] world. Always go and
[1:05:22] see and go and
[1:05:24] hear. You know, God always has a table
[1:05:27] spreaded something for for
[1:05:31] you. This is a weekend. It's a holiday
[1:05:34] rather.
[1:05:37] um where you are not going to be at
[1:05:39] work.
[1:05:40] So where are you going to be? At home
[1:05:44] when others are in a in a
[1:05:47] convention. Believers don't believe
[1:05:50] that. A prophet taught us always go and
[1:05:54] join
[1:05:55] in. When all the saints are coming from
[1:05:57] different parts of the
[1:06:00] country bringing their leaks of
[1:06:04] fire, you go and be together with
[1:06:06] me. So probably I'll also go there on
[1:06:11] Friday and partake of uh whatever the
[1:06:15] Lord has for
[1:06:17] us. Then Saturday early in the
[1:06:21] morning, I'll be traveling. So Sunday
[1:06:25] morning we shall have our usual service
[1:06:28] here. So please come and and and attend
[1:06:33] it and then after the service
[1:06:37] one Sunday
[1:06:38] morning and then you can now go back
[1:06:41] and to the convention up to
[1:06:45] Monday. Also I wanted to appreciate
[1:06:47] those um several uh uh brethren I think
[1:06:51] more than 20 brethren who have been able
[1:06:54] to contribute towards the cause of
[1:06:56] sister
[1:07:05] Assumptarity and
[1:07:08] love. I talked to the sister last
[1:07:13] night you know she was in tears
[1:07:16] because of gratitude
[1:07:19] and um and also you know not knowing
[1:07:21] that the the devil could do that to her.
[1:07:23] It
[1:07:27] was you know when they when they con you
[1:07:30] when a conman cons you feel so
[1:07:35] stupid but you see what I advised
[1:07:38] her was sister and I want to also advise
[1:07:42] all of you and those of you listening
[1:07:46] And I think I'll need my microphone. Uh
[1:07:48] I I cannot hear myself well, brother. So
[1:07:51] I just need to advise you
[1:07:54] uh to really
[1:07:57] um be careful when you are using your
[1:08:04] phones. Be careful when you are promised
[1:08:08] a deal.
[1:08:11] Be careful when you are when you think
[1:08:14] you are going to hit a
[1:08:17] jackapot when you are going in a gold
[1:08:19] mine to take the
[1:08:21] [Applause]
[1:08:24] treasure the treasure you never worked
[1:08:29] for. Some people are so lazy but they
[1:08:31] always want to go for a treasure
[1:08:37] hunt. They think someone forgot it
[1:08:40] there. someone is so kind to give to
[1:08:43] you and then they will capture your
[1:08:47] mind and then you take you give them
[1:08:50] everything you
[1:08:52] have. You really have to be
[1:08:55] cautious on those kind of
[1:08:57] things. She told me the
[1:09:00] story and I had to tell her sister you
[1:09:03] have to be on the
[1:09:05] watch for those kind of things just to
[1:09:07] know whatever you have not worked
[1:09:09] for and someone wants to give it to
[1:09:12] you there is a problem
[1:09:15] somewhere always don't desire free
[1:09:19] things I mean you have to end up and pay
[1:09:22] for it for to be in three nights in
[1:09:29] So it was not
[1:09:30] good. But um we want to thank the body
[1:09:33] of of
[1:09:35] believers that we are able to run out to
[1:09:37] her
[1:09:38] rescue. These are not things we can
[1:09:40] always
[1:09:42] do. Now that we have warned
[1:09:45] you, if the next of you also goes into
[1:09:48] the same
[1:09:50] thing, don't expect the church to
[1:09:53] receive. We will pray for
[1:09:57] you. So don't get due saying the church
[1:10:01] will help
[1:10:05] me. Instead of giving your ch your
[1:10:07] little money to the corn
[1:10:10] people, pay it in the convention.
[1:10:13] give it to land
[1:10:15] funds, give it in
[1:10:17] offerings. That is the better investing.
[1:10:22] So, I think that's all I have to say
[1:10:24] about that. But I I was so touched to
[1:10:27] really see what you could do to one of
[1:10:31] [Music]
[1:10:33] us. God bless you so
[1:10:38] much. Amen.
[1:10:40] So, this evening For just a few moments,
[1:10:43] I want to speak on a subject of he knows
[1:10:47] how you
[1:10:52] feel. Tell your neighbor, he knows how
[1:10:54] you
[1:10:57] feel. Now we are thinking of Easter.
[1:11:02] This being the res the resurrection
[1:11:06] period.
[1:11:08] It's a season when the whole world is
[1:11:10] remembering uh his
[1:11:13] resurrection. And uh you know we we know
[1:11:16] that not all that remember his
[1:11:18] resurrection really believe in
[1:11:23] it. But you see when I say he is I mean
[1:11:28] Jesus. So who is
[1:11:31] Jesus? Who was Jesus?
[1:11:34] Why did he come to the earth?
[1:11:37] Why did he suffer and die to begin
[1:11:40] with? Now, we know that the Bible calls
[1:11:43] him the word of
[1:11:45] God. And we know that the Bible in the
[1:11:47] book of John 1 says, "In the beginning
[1:11:49] was the word and the word was with
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:55] God and the word was God."
[1:12:00] So, so we believe that Jesus is
[1:12:03] God. So, the question then comes up.
[1:12:07] This confuses many believers and many
[1:12:11] Christians. They say, "So, who is God
[1:12:14] then? How can Jesus being a man be
[1:12:19] God? Do we have two
[1:12:22] gods?" The answer is no. We have one
[1:12:25] God. Praise the name of the Lord. I'm
[1:12:28] happy to see you, Sister Rachel.
[1:12:31] We have one God and the the Bible calls
[1:12:34] this God a
[1:12:37] spirit. So this is we are going to first
[1:12:39] of all take take you through
[1:12:41] that. Just give you a few scriptures. I
[1:12:44] know this will help many of
[1:12:46] you. John 4:24 says God is a
[1:12:50] spirit and they that worship him must
[1:12:53] worship him in spirit and in truth.
[1:12:58] So God is not flesh and
[1:13:00] blood. God is a spirit. And we are
[1:13:04] talking about the creator of heaven and
[1:13:07] earth. He he created the whole heaven,
[1:13:11] the whole earth and everything that is
[1:13:13] in him. He's a spirit. But when you see
[1:13:18] also here in the book of Isaiah
[1:13:21] 45, he says, "Tell ye and bring them
[1:13:23] near." Vers 21. Yeah. Let them take
[1:13:26] counsel together. Who has declared this
[1:13:29] from ancient
[1:13:33] [Music]
[1:13:35] time? Excuse me. My my my sound is
[1:13:37] really just loud, brother Shame. Today
[1:13:40] I'm not appreciating my sound as always.
[1:13:42] I'm sure you can make it better. Thank
[1:13:44] you. So it says here, who has you can
[1:13:46] just check check out that verse 21. It
[1:13:48] says, "Who has declared this from
[1:13:50] ancient time? Who has told it from that
[1:13:53] time? Have not I the Lord? And there is
[1:13:57] no God else beside me, a just God and a
[1:14:01] Savior. There is none beside me. Look
[1:14:05] unto me and be ye saved all the ends of
[1:14:08] the earth. For I am God and there is
[1:14:10] none else.
[1:14:23] [Music]
[1:14:38] [Music]
[1:14:42] So now we see here he's calling himself
[1:14:45] the
[1:14:45] Lord and he's saying he's
[1:14:48] God and there is no God beside
[1:14:53] him. The trinity draws three sculpt
[1:15:00] sculptures. You can actually go on on on
[1:15:02] Google you will see
[1:15:03] that and the father is in the
[1:15:07] middle and and the Holy Spirit. There is
[1:15:10] even three thrones in
[1:15:11] heaven according to them. One for the
[1:15:14] father, one for the son who is beside
[1:15:17] him on the right side and then another
[1:15:20] one for the holy spirit. But you see
[1:15:22] that is all the imagination of
[1:15:25] man. God is a spirit and there is no one
[1:15:29] beside
[1:15:31] him. He is the lord and the bible says
[1:15:34] he is a
[1:15:36] savior. There is no savior beside
[1:15:39] him. In other words, he's the only
[1:15:41] savior that there is in the world.
[1:15:46] Praise the name of the Lord. So then if
[1:15:48] we say Jesus is
[1:15:51] God, that's a very big claim.
[1:15:55] And it is important for you a believer
[1:15:57] to be able to know how does Jesus become
[1:16:00] God.
[1:16:05] If you go right here in the book of
[1:16:07] Matthew and I I'll take you in other
[1:16:10] scriptures but let's first I did not
[1:16:11] prepare this but I feel to read it for
[1:16:15] you this in the book of Matthew chapter
[1:16:18] one I read some of these kind of
[1:16:20] scriptures when I'm doing outreach to uh
[1:16:23] people but I want you to also get to
[1:16:25] understand these
[1:16:29] things vers um
[1:16:33] 21. I'm just trying to read the verse 27
[1:16:37] time. And she shall bring forth a son,
[1:16:39] and thou shalt call his name Jesus, for
[1:16:42] he shall save his people from their
[1:16:46] [Applause]
[1:16:51] sins. Amen. So, he's talking about Mary
[1:16:54] giving birth to a
[1:16:57] son and this son would be called Jesus.
[1:17:02] Everybody say Jesus. And he says Jesus
[1:17:06] what shall he do? He will save his
[1:17:09] people from their sins. So which means
[1:17:13] Jesus had his
[1:17:15] people. Who are his people? His people
[1:17:19] are not just a few
[1:17:21] people. His people are his people are
[1:17:24] not only
[1:17:25] Uganda. Oh America. Oh Cameroon. Oh
[1:17:30] Israel, his people are the whole world.
[1:17:36] In the book of first John, he says
[1:17:39] rather in John one, he says he came
[1:17:41] among his
[1:17:43] own, but his own received him
[1:17:46] not. He was the light that shined in
[1:17:51] darkness, and darkness comprehended it
[1:17:53] not.
[1:17:56] to as many as received
[1:17:58] him to them he gave them
[1:18:01] power to become to be the son of God. So
[1:18:05] now we see this Jesus had power to save.
[1:18:09] Where did he get that power? There's
[1:18:12] only one
[1:18:13] savior and that is God and God is a
[1:18:17] spirit. How then can Jesus be a
[1:18:21] savior? The only way Jesus can be the
[1:18:24] savior
[1:18:26] It's because Jesus is
[1:18:29] God. Are you enjoying this now? Praise
[1:18:32] the name of the Lord. And and if you
[1:18:35] look at the book of Malachi chapter
[1:18:37] 3, there are many ways we can approach
[1:18:42] this. Look at Malachi chapter
[1:18:47] 3 vers one.
[1:18:54] Behold, I will send you my messenger,
[1:18:57] and he shall prepare the way before me,
[1:18:59] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:19:01] suddenly come to his temple, even the
[1:19:04] messenger of the covenant whom ye
[1:19:05] delight in. Behold, he shall come, saith
[1:19:08] the Lord of hosts.
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:28] Praise the
[1:19:29] Lord. Praise the Lord. Are you following
[1:19:33] me now? So, here is Prophet Malachi
[1:19:36] giving this
[1:19:38] prophecy. And he says, "I'll send my
[1:19:41] messenger. This messenger here is John
[1:19:43] the Baptist.
[1:19:46] and he shall prepare the way before
[1:19:49] me. Remember the these prophets of the
[1:19:52] Old Testament, we are always speaking on
[1:19:55] behalf of
[1:19:58] God. And here this uh prophet Malachi is
[1:20:03] speaking as if it were God himself
[1:20:05] speaking.
[1:20:09] And also God is speaking and he's saying
[1:20:12] I will send my
[1:20:13] messenger and he shall prepare the way
[1:20:16] before
[1:20:18] me meaning who was coming.
[1:20:23] Oh you are not following me. Are you
[1:20:24] following me? So meaning who was coming?
[1:20:27] God. So the messenger was going to come
[1:20:31] to prepare the way before God is
[1:20:36] coming. John the
[1:20:38] Baptist did not come to prepare for
[1:20:41] another
[1:20:43] man. He came to prepare for
[1:20:46] God, the creator of heaven and
[1:20:49] earth. And he said, "Now when he comes,
[1:20:53] he prepared the way before
[1:20:55] me. And the
[1:20:57] Lord, the same Lord who said, I am the
[1:21:02] Lord and beside me there is no other
[1:21:04] God."
[1:21:06] Praise the name of the Lord. Here he
[1:21:08] says, "And the
[1:21:09] Lord whom he
[1:21:11] sick," you know the Jews had a
[1:21:14] temple which had three places, the holy
[1:21:18] of holies and the holy place and the
[1:21:20] sanctuary and they would go in there and
[1:21:23] worship, you know, and you know they
[1:21:26] were seeking after this
[1:21:28] God, you know, all the days of their
[1:21:31] life. The high priest will go in into
[1:21:34] the holy of holies once a
[1:21:36] year, every year to atone for his sins
[1:21:39] and of the
[1:21:40] people. But now here God is declaring
[1:21:44] that the Lord whom he
[1:21:46] seek would now suddenly come into his
[1:21:49] temple.
[1:21:52] All right. Now you remember there was a
[1:21:53] temple of
[1:21:56] Solomon. The temple of Solomon was a
[1:21:58] temple made with hands. It was built
[1:22:03] And you see the when you talk about a
[1:22:05] temple and you talk you talk to the
[1:22:06] Jews, they think you're talking about
[1:22:07] that
[1:22:12] building. But you see, always pay
[1:22:15] attention when God speaks through his
[1:22:20] servants. The word means much more than
[1:22:23] what you are
[1:22:26] hearing. That's why many times even
[1:22:28] after the preacher has preached, go back
[1:22:29] and listen. you will see you are hearing
[1:22:31] something
[1:22:35] else. So here Malachi says that then the
[1:22:38] Lord will suddenly come to his
[1:22:42] temple and he calls this Lord who is
[1:22:44] going to come the messenger of the
[1:22:50] covenant whom they delighted
[1:22:53] in. You remember how he made the
[1:22:55] covenant in the Old Testament with the
[1:22:56] Jews with with the Israelites. Actually
[1:23:00] he made the convert with
[1:23:02] Abraham much
[1:23:04] earlier and he says that he is going to
[1:23:07] suddenly come into his
[1:23:10] temple and the people were reading this
[1:23:13] every
[1:23:15] day. They were thinking God is going to
[1:23:17] come in the holy of
[1:23:20] holies. That is the proper explanation.
[1:23:24] The easy explanation that everyone would
[1:23:27] understand. God is going to come into
[1:23:30] the
[1:23:30] temple. God is going to come into the
[1:23:32] holy of holies. But I want you to see
[1:23:35] this meant more than
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:39] one. If you look at John 2
[1:23:43] 18, he says, "Then answered the Jews and
[1:23:46] said unto
[1:23:47] him, what sign showest thou unto
[1:23:50] us? See that thou doest these things?
[1:23:55] Jesus now he's here. He is born.
[1:23:59] Actually, let let me tell you this
[1:24:00] scripture in Malachi was already
[1:24:04] fulfilled. They were looking at him. And
[1:24:07] I couldn't understand. They said, "Give
[1:24:10] us a sign. What sign do you show
[1:24:13] us?" And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:24:16] them, he gave them a sign. Remember
[1:24:19] whatever sign that God will give
[1:24:22] you, it will be a word
[1:24:26] sign. Amen. He gave them many signs
[1:24:29] during his earthly ministry and this is
[1:24:32] one of them.
[1:24:34] One time when they asked him for a
[1:24:36] sign, he he talked about prophet
[1:24:39] Jonas and he said how he spent three
[1:24:42] nights and days in the womb of the of
[1:24:45] the
[1:24:48] fish. They couldn't
[1:24:50] understand. But he was talking about his
[1:24:52] death and and and
[1:24:55] resurrection, how he would be there for
[1:24:57] three
[1:24:59] days. And it was a sign which was before
[1:25:01] them.
[1:25:04] actually happened but they were still
[1:25:07] blind. The religious world
[1:25:10] today they have all sorts of
[1:25:12] signs but they can't understand it
[1:25:15] because they have no
[1:25:17] revelation. May God give you revelation
[1:25:19] this
[1:25:21] evening. So we see here he gave them a
[1:25:24] sign and he said destroy this
[1:25:27] temple and in three days I will raise it
[1:25:30] up. Then they they began to speak among
[1:25:35] themselves 46
[1:25:38] years. This temple was in building and
[1:25:41] you you are saying you're going to rare
[1:25:43] it up in 3
[1:25:46] days. They didn't understand. How can
[1:25:50] you say this temple this
[1:25:52] temple we build? It was built for 46
[1:25:57] years. Who are you? a little boy who was
[1:26:01] born by who don't even know your
[1:26:04] father and you are saying in in in three
[1:26:08] days you're going to build this temple
[1:26:11] again you're
[1:26:13] blasphing they didn't understand it but
[1:26:17] the Bible says he spake of the temple of
[1:26:20] his
[1:26:24] body so listen to me when he told them
[1:26:27] destroy this
[1:26:28] temple I don't know where he was
[1:26:31] pointing but I can assure you even if he
[1:26:35] was pointing to
[1:26:36] himself they would still have remained
[1:26:40] blind destroy this temple they would say
[1:26:43] the man was even beating his
[1:26:46] church he was he's a proud man he can't
[1:26:50] understand but this are sac
[1:26:52] scripture can you imagine he said
[1:26:55] destroy this number but he was talking
[1:26:58] about his own
[1:26:59] body because this this body of Jesus,
[1:27:03] Amen, was the temple of God
[1:27:06] himself, the creator of heaven and
[1:27:09] earth, the one who say that he had even
[1:27:12] prophesied
[1:27:15] it. And you know when Malachi prophesied
[1:27:18] and he
[1:27:19] said then the Lord shall
[1:27:23] suddenly come into his
[1:27:26] temple. He was talking about the
[1:27:29] body of
[1:27:32] Jesus. Amen. So now when Jesus came, he
[1:27:37] knew that his body was a temple. Amen.
[1:27:41] Jesus himself knew. He was more than a
[1:27:44] man. He knew his body was a body of God
[1:27:48] to dwell in
[1:27:50] him. Amen. And he says, "Destroy this
[1:27:53] temple." A temple means where God dwell.
[1:27:56] a place where God
[1:27:59] dwells and he said, "Destroy it and I
[1:28:03] will raise it up." Let me ask you a
[1:28:05] question. Who do you think was speaking
[1:28:07] those words?
[1:28:10] Do you know that Jesus was 100%
[1:28:13] man and 100%
[1:28:17] God? Sometimes when he spoke, it was not
[1:28:20] God who was speaking.
[1:28:23] Sometimes when he spoke it was God who
[1:28:26] was speaking.
[1:28:27] So you need to understand when you hear
[1:28:30] the word who is talking is either God or
[1:28:36] the son it is either the son or the
[1:28:40] father because the father and the
[1:28:43] son united
[1:28:46] together. Amen. Amen. So at this point
[1:28:51] it was not the son
[1:28:53] talking it was the father talking when
[1:28:57] he said destroy this
[1:28:59] temple I will raise it up.
[1:29:03] Amen. What raised up
[1:29:05] Christ spirit that same spirit raised
[1:29:09] Christ from the
[1:29:10] dead if it dwells in us it will quicken
[1:29:14] our mortal
[1:29:15] body. God is our
[1:29:20] spirit. So you see now what was
[1:29:23] speaking it was not Jesus speaking
[1:29:27] but it was the mouth of Jesus
[1:29:30] moving but it was
[1:29:33] God the creator of heaven and earth
[1:29:37] speaking through a
[1:29:39] man and he is the same yesterday today
[1:29:41] and
[1:29:43] forever. He he does it every day in our
[1:29:45] life.
[1:29:47] You can see a man you know and then you
[1:29:51] say God is speaking to
[1:29:55] you. God speaks through
[1:29:57] man. Tell your neighbor God speaks
[1:30:00] through
[1:30:01] man. And here God is speaking and he's
[1:30:05] saying destroy this
[1:30:06] temple. I will raise it
[1:30:09] up. Who can raise the
[1:30:11] dead? God alone can raise the
[1:30:14] dead. Amen. And it is
[1:30:17] God, the father of our Lord
[1:30:20] Jesus, who raised up Christ from the
[1:30:25] dead. How many understand? Say
[1:30:28] amen. He raised him from the
[1:30:30] dead. Who raised Jesus from the dead?
[1:30:33] God raised Jesus from the
[1:30:36] dead. Who is God? God is a spirit. Who
[1:30:41] is Jesus? Jesus is the son of God.
[1:30:45] Son of God means flesh of
[1:30:48] God. So meaning Jesus was not another
[1:30:53] God. It was the temple where the creator
[1:30:57] of
[1:30:58] heaven dwelt inside of him. So sometimes
[1:31:03] God can speak from
[1:31:05] him. Sometimes he can speak from him
[1:31:08] from him from him.
[1:31:13] Sometimes you can speak from
[1:31:15] heaven. So people are
[1:31:18] confused when they hear our voice
[1:31:20] speaking. They say
[1:31:23] that they they fail to understand. God
[1:31:27] can speak from
[1:31:28] heaven because God feels all of
[1:31:32] heaven. God can speak from
[1:31:35] Jesus. God was feeling all of Jesus.
[1:31:40] God can speak out of
[1:31:42] me of you because he is the same
[1:31:49] God. Are you
[1:31:52] confused? It means the
[1:31:58] presence
[1:31:59] God who dwells
[1:32:02] everywhere at the same time.
[1:32:06] He fills the mountains. He feels the
[1:32:09] sea. He's in me. He's in you. He's in
[1:32:13] America. He's in heaven. He's in Russia.
[1:32:16] At the same
[1:32:19] time, hallelujah. But when he was in
[1:32:23] Jesus, he was there in his full
[1:32:26] [Music]
[1:32:28] name. In me, he's in me in a
[1:32:33] portion, in a
[1:32:35] measure. That's why I need you.
[1:32:38] because you also have a
[1:32:39] measure. So when we all are
[1:32:43] combined, we make up the fullness of
[1:32:46] God. Amen. So you see that's why when he
[1:32:50] says she is
[1:32:52] him, he means the
[1:32:54] body and the body is a collective body
[1:32:57] is a many membered body.
[1:33:01] You see that's why we we don't look at
[1:33:04] uh at churches individual churches as
[1:33:06] the only true church. No,
[1:33:12] the true church of Jesus Christ is a
[1:33:15] many membered body and it is all over
[1:33:17] the
[1:33:19] world and we need one
[1:33:22] another. Each of us has a portion
[1:33:26] portion. He came on the day of Pentecost
[1:33:29] and he divided
[1:33:31] himself into leaks of fire and this
[1:33:34] rested upon the
[1:33:37] disciples and each of them started
[1:33:39] speaking in
[1:33:40] tongues. What was that? That was God
[1:33:43] resting upon
[1:33:44] them in the form of the
[1:33:49] spirit. Amen.
[1:33:51] Hallelujah. Amen. But in Jesus, he was
[1:33:55] there in his full
[1:34:00] name. So Jesus was a temple of God,
[1:34:05] the fullness of Godhead
[1:34:12] bodily. That's why when Paul was
[1:34:15] walking and he met that pill of fire,
[1:34:19] the same pill of fire that came on the
[1:34:20] day of
[1:34:27] Pentecost which went out of
[1:34:30] God. When he met it, I asked a question,
[1:34:34] who are you, my Lord? Paul knew that
[1:34:37] that is the Lord of
[1:34:39] heaven. But the name the name had now
[1:34:43] been
[1:34:44] known because he had been born in a in a
[1:34:47] house in
[1:34:51] a he said I am Jesus
[1:34:54] whom thou
[1:34:56] persecutest but remember listen
[1:34:59] carefully closely Paul did not persecute
[1:35:02] this spirit of
[1:35:06] fire was persecuting
[1:35:10] people, people who had
[1:35:13] weaknesses, but people who had the
[1:35:15] spirit of God in
[1:35:17] them. Paul was persecuting
[1:35:19] them. And the pillar of fire was
[1:35:23] about and the pill of fire said, "I am
[1:35:28] Jesus."
[1:35:30] Now listen, listen. Look at this. He's
[1:35:32] speaking. I am
[1:35:35] Jesus whom you thou persecuted.
[1:35:39] Amen.
[1:35:41] God identified
[1:35:44] himself one with the
[1:35:49] body. Is this very very difficult
[1:35:55] theology? How many are understanding?
[1:35:58] Amen. God was in his people. In other
[1:36:02] words, God Paul was God was telling
[1:36:04] Paul,
[1:36:06] I
[1:36:08] am
[1:36:11] God Jesus.
[1:36:14] I am
[1:36:15] God in my people.
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:21] And when Jesus was on
[1:36:23] earth, he was the fullness of
[1:36:25] Godhead. And when he
[1:36:28] left, you see the body is
[1:36:33] So just like Jesus walked on earth, when
[1:36:37] we walk on earth, we are the same same
[1:36:40] work.
[1:36:42] Amen. Same power, same
[1:36:46] authority. Amen. That's why certain
[1:36:48] things we even
[1:36:51] vote and they say the
[1:36:55] majority. Why? Because we believe the
[1:36:58] church is a body of Christ.
[1:37:02] It has the power to decide. It has the
[1:37:05] power to speak things and things. You
[1:37:09] see the body and the head has become
[1:37:11] one.
[1:37:14] Jesus answered and said unto them,
[1:37:17] destroy this
[1:37:18] temple and in three
[1:37:20] days
[1:37:23] I is not the body
[1:37:26] speaking. The spirit in the body
[1:37:28] speaking.
[1:37:31] I will raise it up. Did he raise it up?
[1:37:36] I say yes, he raised it up.
[1:37:39] Easter morning. He rose again.
[1:37:43] Who raised him up? God the creator of
[1:37:45] heaven and
[1:37:47] earth. He raised up his
[1:37:51] temple. Hallelujah. Amen. My my my. Now
[1:37:57] in John chapter 10,
[1:38:00] There are many many scriptures which are
[1:38:02] very sweet on
[1:38:04] this. But the Holy Spirit led me to pick
[1:38:06] out a
[1:38:07] few to share with you
[1:38:09] tonight. Then came the Jews around about
[1:38:12] him and said to
[1:38:13] him, how long does thou make us to
[1:38:17] [Music]
[1:38:19] doubt? If thou be the
[1:38:22] Christ, tell us
[1:38:25] plainly. The Jews knew Christ means
[1:38:30] God. So if you are the Christ who was
[1:38:34] promised, if you are the
[1:38:36] Messiah, just say I am the
[1:38:39] Messiah. Because you're confusing us.
[1:38:42] Sometimes you speak as if you are the
[1:38:45] Messiah. Sometimes you speak as if you
[1:38:48] are not. So who are you? You're
[1:38:50] confusing us. Tell us plainly. These are
[1:38:54] the religious leaders.
[1:38:56] until today they are
[1:38:58] confused. But thank God our eyes are
[1:39:02] open. Hallelujah. We know who Christ is.
[1:39:07] Amen. And the church is built upon that
[1:39:11] foundation. The church is built upon,
[1:39:14] Amen. the revelation of Jesus
[1:39:18] Christ. Amen. Tell us
[1:39:20] plainly. And then Jesus answered them.
[1:39:24] He will always answer them,
[1:39:27] but they will never
[1:39:30] understand. And and I told you and you
[1:39:34] believe
[1:39:34] not the works that I
[1:39:39] do. If you are Christ also, we can know
[1:39:41] by the
[1:39:44] works. The works that I
[1:39:47] do in my father's
[1:39:50] name, they bear witness of me.
[1:39:55] What was his father's name?
[1:39:58] It was the
[1:40:00] Lord. And in other words, oh my God,
[1:40:04] he's trying to tell them. Can you see
[1:40:07] the works I am doing? Assuring my
[1:40:11] power. I am the Lord. Can you see? I
[1:40:15] have come to you in my father's name.
[1:40:21] But they still were blind.
[1:40:23] And he said, "But ye believe
[1:40:25] not because ye are not of my
[1:40:29] sheep, as I said unto you, my sheep hear
[1:40:34] my
[1:40:36] voice, and I know
[1:40:39] them, and they follow
[1:40:41] me." Amen. We are of his sheep
[1:40:46] truly. And I know them, and they follow
[1:40:49] me. and I give unto them eternal
[1:40:55] life. Give them eternal life. Only God
[1:40:59] can. Jesus is answering them but without
[1:41:02] answering
[1:41:05] them. In other words, only the sheep can
[1:41:08] hear his
[1:41:10] voice. Are you his sheep?
[1:41:13] He is saying he will give you eternal
[1:41:16] life because he's the alpha of eternal
[1:41:21] life. He's the beginning.
[1:41:24] He's the end. He's the alpha. He's the
[1:41:27] omega. There is no God beside
[1:41:31] him. I give them eternal life and they
[1:41:34] shall never
[1:41:35] perish. Neither shall any man block them
[1:41:38] out of my
[1:41:40] heart. My father
[1:41:43] Oh, now he has gone back to his father.
[1:41:46] Some of you now your heads are saying
[1:41:48] no. Don't you worry.
[1:41:52] Let's continue together my father
[1:41:55] because I want you to remember Jesus
[1:41:58] sometimes speaks as
[1:42:00] Jesus and sometimes he speaks as the
[1:42:04] father. So you need to know when who is
[1:42:09] speaking. My father which gave them me
[1:42:13] is greater than all and no man is able
[1:42:16] to pluck them out of my father's
[1:42:19] hand. Wait wait wait wait
[1:42:21] wait. This theology is very delicious.
[1:42:25] Here he
[1:42:26] says my sheep hear my voice and I know
[1:42:29] them and they follow me and I give them
[1:42:32] eternal life. They cannot perish.
[1:42:35] Neither shall
[1:42:37] man them out of my house.
[1:42:41] first person
[1:42:45] pronoun. No one can pluck them out of my
[1:42:48] my
[1:42:48] hand. Who is
[1:42:51] talking? The father is
[1:42:53] talking through the
[1:42:56] son and then afterwards the son begins
[1:42:59] talking. My father which gave them
[1:43:02] me is greater than all and no man is
[1:43:06] able to flatter them out of my father's
[1:43:09] hands. In whose hands are you?
[1:43:14] Are you in the hands of
[1:43:16] Jesus? Are you in the hands of the
[1:43:21] father? Praise God. We are in the hands
[1:43:25] of the
[1:43:27] father. We are in the hands of the
[1:43:29] father.
[1:43:31] Amen. Because Jesus's
[1:43:34] hand are the father's hand,
[1:43:37] the father and the son are
[1:43:42] one. Amen.
[1:43:45] And he says, hey, right here, vers 30,
[1:43:49] he says, I and my father are
[1:43:55] one. Hallelujah. Now the se like ah
[1:44:02] ring their heads and they confused
[1:44:05] now. Then the Jews took up the
[1:44:09] stones
[1:44:11] again to stone
[1:44:14] him because they had now
[1:44:17] understood. It means that this
[1:44:19] guy actually claiming to be God
[1:44:23] himself. Why? because they failed to
[1:44:27] understand Jesus the
[1:44:29] son was not
[1:44:31] God. But the father was God and the
[1:44:36] father is a spirit and that father in
[1:44:40] the
[1:44:42] son and that father was speaking to
[1:44:46] them claiming to be God. And I said you
[1:44:51] a human being you are claiming to be
[1:44:53] God.
[1:44:54] We will kill you right
[1:44:56] now. They fail to understand the
[1:45:00] relationship between the father and the
[1:45:03] son. Don't also fail to
[1:45:06] understand. I and my father are
[1:45:09] one. Then the Jews took up the stones
[1:45:12] against Jesus answered, "Many works have
[1:45:16] I showed you from my
[1:45:20] father. For which of those do you stone
[1:45:24] me? Who is talking? Who is
[1:45:28] talking? The son is not talking because
[1:45:32] the father can never be
[1:45:35] stormed. Why? Because a
[1:45:38] spirit. But the son can be stoned and
[1:45:41] the son can be killed. And indeed the
[1:45:44] son was
[1:45:45] killed. and the father raised you up
[1:45:51] again. So he was not telling them why do
[1:45:54] you stone
[1:45:57] me because of the good works that I have
[1:45:59] shown you from my
[1:46:01] father for the for of which of those
[1:46:04] works do you stone
[1:46:07] me? The Jews answered him, saying, "For
[1:46:11] a good work we stone thee
[1:46:14] not, but for
[1:46:16] blasphemy, and because of thou being a
[1:46:20] man, maketh thyself
[1:46:23] God." Did Did he say he was
[1:46:27] God? He simply said he was a son of the
[1:46:32] father. And he said that he and his
[1:46:34] father are one.
[1:46:38] That's why their eyes became
[1:46:41] red and they said we will stone it right
[1:46:46] here. Friends, let me tell you today the
[1:46:50] church world is storing
[1:46:53] Jesus by rejecting him by rejecting his
[1:46:58] word. This word and the father are
[1:47:03] one. I and the father are one.
[1:47:07] Hey, I can also say
[1:47:08] that I am a
[1:47:11] father. I am a
[1:47:13] father. Oh, glory to God. You don't have
[1:47:17] to understand it. You just have to
[1:47:20] believe it with all your
[1:47:21] heart. You are a part of
[1:47:24] God and God is a
[1:47:27] spirit and he is dwelling in you.
[1:47:31] The body is yours,
[1:47:33] but the but but but that which is on the
[1:47:36] inside
[1:47:37] is the father controlling
[1:47:40] you, speaking through you, doing the
[1:47:43] works through you, living the life
[1:47:45] through
[1:47:46] you. That's why you cannot live like the
[1:47:49] world. When you are filled with the
[1:47:51] spirit of
[1:47:52] God, you cannot live like the
[1:47:55] world. Something in
[1:47:57] you leads and controls your flesh.
[1:48:01] The flesh is not
[1:48:06] that, but that controls
[1:48:13] the when you
[1:48:16] die will raise you up
[1:48:20] again. That's why we believe in a
[1:48:23] resurrection of the
[1:48:26] dead. Amen.
[1:48:29] The blood of
[1:48:30] Jesus was not of
[1:48:33] Jesus. Was of
[1:48:35] God. You and I were born out of
[1:48:40] lust. But you see
[1:48:42] Jesus was not born out of
[1:48:45] that. He the seed of
[1:48:48] Jesus came from God.
[1:48:52] The egg that from him
[1:48:58] was a was a human was humanlike
[1:49:04] egg but created by
[1:49:10] God. It was not out of
[1:49:12] Mary. It was not precreated.
[1:49:15] [Music]
[1:49:17] God created both
[1:49:19] seed and egg and they
[1:49:23] came into the womb of Mary. When she
[1:49:26] said be unto
[1:49:28] me it happened and right in there was
[1:49:32] little
[1:49:34] Jesus growing growing one month, two
[1:49:38] months, three months. Who was that?
[1:49:42] Elohim to mankind.
[1:49:46] Hallelujah. Acts
[1:49:48] 20 27. For I have not shunned to declare
[1:49:52] unto you all the counsel of
[1:49:55] God. Take it therefore unto that and
[1:50:00] unto all the flock of
[1:50:01] God, over the which the Holy Ghost has
[1:50:04] made you
[1:50:08] overseers to feed the church of God.
[1:50:13] God has purchased with his own
[1:50:21] blood. Who bought the
[1:50:24] church? God
[1:50:27] himself whose blood was
[1:50:29] shed, the blood of Jesus. But now here
[1:50:33] God is claiming the blood to be his
[1:50:36] own. He's saying it was my blood which
[1:50:39] was
[1:50:40] shed not just the blood of a human being
[1:50:44] because this human
[1:50:46] being was me expressed into human
[1:50:55] kind of the duty of Jesus Christ.
[1:51:00] Therefore, when Mary, knowing not a
[1:51:05] man, she was with a male uh uh God, the
[1:51:10] Almighty Jehovah, and he overshadowed
[1:51:14] her. And God is the
[1:51:17] creator that created a blood cell in the
[1:51:20] womb of Mary.
[1:51:23] Mary knowing no man at
[1:51:25] all. And that brought forth the very
[1:51:28] creative blood of
[1:51:34] God to redeem us from our
[1:51:38] life coming in here to be born of sexual
[1:51:42] [Music]
[1:51:46] desire. And then that blood was drawn
[1:51:49] out of Emmanuel's vein.
[1:51:54] on Calvar's
[1:51:55] cross. And today it has the same saving,
[1:51:58] redeeming, holy
[1:52:03] power that it did in the day the
[1:52:06] transfusion was made out at
[1:52:11] Calvary. You believe it? Say amen if you
[1:52:15] believe. We are redeemed by the blood of
[1:52:18] God.
[1:52:19] The blood says we are bought by the
[1:52:21] blood. The Bible says we are bought by
[1:52:24] the
[1:52:26] blood. And redeemed by
[1:52:29] blood. God is own
[1:52:32] blood. How is it? God is blood. You
[1:52:36] ask. God has no
[1:52:38] blood. How could it be?
[1:52:42] Because oh I love it when the prophet
[1:52:44] says
[1:52:46] because that is not an imagination.
[1:52:50] is giving you thus say the
[1:52:54] word because it was God's creative blood
[1:52:59] that he
[1:53:04] created in order that redeemer
[1:53:07] us and he came and lived in the same
[1:53:10] body that he
[1:53:14] created. He created the body. The body
[1:53:18] grew, grew, grew, grew and was
[1:53:23] born. Amen. And then God
[1:53:28] himself, this is my beloved
[1:53:31] son. This is my beloved creative
[1:53:36] blood in whom I am well
[1:53:40] pleased. God himself came
[1:53:43] down and lived in the body he had
[1:53:46] created.
[1:53:49] Amen. Was Jesus a son of God?
[1:53:53] Yes. But God lived in his son.
[1:53:59] Are you confused or you are now getting
[1:54:01] revelation?
[1:54:09] The
[1:54:11] Godhead is one of the things that
[1:54:12] disturbed
[1:54:14] me when I first believed this
[1:54:17] message until I said,
[1:54:19] "God, I'm no longer going to try and
[1:54:21] figure it
[1:54:22] out because I would understand when I
[1:54:24] read the
[1:54:25] scripture, when I understand another
[1:54:27] one, I see another one. Ah, it puts me
[1:54:30] off
[1:54:31] again now until I said I give up." But I
[1:54:35] believe there is one
[1:54:37] God. Say God reveal it to me. So what
[1:54:41] I'm preaching to you tonight, I'm
[1:54:43] preaching it out of
[1:54:46] revelation. I am not confused. You can
[1:54:48] be sure of
[1:54:50] that. If you feel confused, it is
[1:54:53] because you yourself need
[1:54:55] revelation. Revelation doesn't come from
[1:54:57] a
[1:54:58] preacher. Revelation comes from God.
[1:55:04] God had to suffer now. Okay. Okay. Okay.
[1:55:07] Okay. All right. How was it? All right.
[1:55:10] Now, I want us to see something
[1:55:12] here. God, came and lived in his own
[1:55:16] body which he
[1:55:18] created. God had to suffer temptation.
[1:55:24] God had to suffer
[1:55:27] temptation trapped in his own
[1:55:31] body which he
[1:55:33] created. God had to suffer
[1:55:35] temptation. He had to suffer sexual
[1:55:40] temptation. Our prophet is saying these
[1:55:44] things.
[1:55:45] God, we are not talking about Jesus
[1:55:48] here. We talking about God.
[1:55:52] Think about it.
[1:55:55] the creator of heaven and earth and he
[1:55:58] lived on his
[1:55:59] body he was feeling different I'm having
[1:56:05] lust
[1:56:07] God he had to
[1:56:10] suffer sexual
[1:56:14] temptation
[1:56:15] why we will know
[1:56:19] why he had to suffer all kinds of
[1:56:22] temptation
[1:56:25] to be tempted by the
[1:56:27] devil in
[1:56:29] riches in powers, dominions and so
[1:56:33] forth. He was tempted with money
[1:56:40] also, dominion,
[1:56:43] power, vain, glory. He was temped with
[1:56:46] all
[1:56:47] that yet he was
[1:56:50] cut. He had a reason why. In order to do
[1:56:55] it, God couldn't be as God in the
[1:57:01] spirit. He had to humble
[1:57:05] himself. He had to be God in
[1:57:11] flesh. Hallelujah. Amen. That's why you
[1:57:14] as a part of
[1:57:16] God. You are here in the
[1:57:19] flesh to be touched by
[1:57:22] sickness to be touched by
[1:57:25] lust to be touched by that
[1:57:28] temptation. But when you
[1:57:31] overcome, you will be on a greater glory
[1:57:33] than all the angels of
[1:57:38] heaven. Because no angel has ever
[1:57:43] overcome. You cannot
[1:57:45] overcome without
[1:57:48] fighting. But when you fight and you go
[1:57:51] through it, then you are an
[1:57:54] overcomer. You are higher than the
[1:57:57] angels. You know what it means to be
[1:58:00] sick. You know what it means to be
[1:58:03] weak. You know what it means to be
[1:58:05] sexually.
[1:58:08] Then you
[1:58:10] overcome them then
[1:58:13] overcome. They will sit with me on my
[1:58:17] throne. Jesus say even I I overcame
[1:58:23] and I will sit with my
[1:58:25] father in his throne. That is dominion.
[1:58:30] Not a physical seat dominion.
[1:58:36] Amen. All right.
[1:58:39] All right. Can I continue and I bring
[1:58:41] this to a close?
[1:58:44] Now I am speaking this morning on the
[1:58:46] dity of
[1:58:48] Christ so that you will know who he is
[1:58:51] that we are worshiping
[1:58:55] today. Amen. Not a baby in a manger,
[1:59:00] not a Santa Claus, but we are worshiping
[1:59:03] the almighty God.
[1:59:06] in the duty of his
[1:59:10] son. And notice then the blood came down
[1:59:13] and was it was Christ Jesus God himself
[1:59:17] coming out of spirit went into Jesus
[1:59:22] Christ. Excuse me. I want you to see
[1:59:24] this very clearly today.
[1:59:28] It says and said and the Bible said God
[1:59:30] was in
[1:59:32] Christ reconciling the world to
[1:59:38] himself. It says God himself
[1:59:42] Jehovah lived in
[1:59:45] Christ and was made a kinsman to us.
[1:59:54] God became my
[1:59:58] brother. Amen. You people are not
[2:00:00] excited about
[2:00:02] this. God becoming our
[2:00:06] brother, you should smile about that,
[2:00:10] brother. God becoming your brother.
[2:00:14] It means if God is becoming your
[2:00:17] brother, he's coming down to your
[2:00:20] level. So you can feel what you
[2:00:24] feel. So at the end, he will be able to
[2:00:28] say, "I know how it
[2:00:32] feels."
[2:00:36] Amen. Hallelujah. That's why we should
[2:00:39] always pray when we are confused, when
[2:00:43] our back is against the wall, when we
[2:00:46] have headache, when we have problems,
[2:00:48] because God understands what to
[2:00:53] feel, more than anyone will
[2:00:56] ever. Hallelujah.
[2:00:59] God was in
[2:01:00] Christ reconciling the world to
[2:01:03] himself. He became a kinsman to us
[2:01:06] because he was born in human flesh like
[2:01:08] we
[2:01:10] are. The blood cells was developed by
[2:01:16] God. The flesh cells the flesh cells
[2:01:19] were developed in the womb of
[2:01:25] Mary. Developed
[2:01:30] not taken out from
[2:01:35] Mary that brought forth the
[2:01:38] child. Mary was the
[2:01:44] incubator and God came down and lived in
[2:01:47] human
[2:01:49] flesh and was tempted.
[2:01:53] every man are just like
[2:01:56] we is asking us do you believe
[2:02:00] that and then he says all right now then
[2:02:04] when he did that he freely gave us his
[2:02:09] blood he didn't have to do
[2:02:11] it he made a
[2:02:14] sacrifice he couldn't have went right on
[2:02:16] up into
[2:02:18] glory he could have gone right up up
[2:02:21] into glory
[2:02:23] He could have just been transfigured
[2:02:24] like he was on Mount
[2:02:28] Transfiguration, went into heaven and
[2:02:30] never died for
[2:02:31] us. But to be willing to die for
[2:02:34] us, he gave freely his blood at
[2:02:40] Calvary. He was a man of sorrow,
[2:02:45] acquainted with
[2:02:47] grief, and he made a public testimony.
[2:02:52] Jesus would have decided, God through
[2:02:54] Jesus would have
[2:02:56] decided to bypass
[2:02:59] Calvary. He would not have died and he
[2:03:03] would have still gone back to
[2:03:06] him. But he decided I will not
[2:03:10] bypass. Let me die so I can give them my
[2:03:16] blood freely. They who were born in
[2:03:21] sin, they will receive my sinless
[2:03:25] blood. That's why the blood of Jesus
[2:03:29] will never lose his
[2:03:33] power. Amen. That's why in Hebrews 4:14
[2:03:36] it says, "Seeing that we have a great
[2:03:39] high
[2:03:40] priest that is passed into the
[2:03:44] heavens, Jesus the son of
[2:03:47] God, let us hold fast our
[2:03:51] profession. For we have not an which
[2:03:53] cannot be touched by with a feeling of
[2:03:54] our
[2:03:57] infirmities, but with all tempted like
[2:04:01] we are.
[2:04:04] in all
[2:04:05] [Music]
[2:04:07] points yet without
[2:04:10] sin. Let us therefore come
[2:04:13] boldly unto the throne of grace that we
[2:04:17] may obtain
[2:04:19] mercy and find grace to help in the
[2:04:25] time. Amen. Let me read for you this
[2:04:27] quote before I
[2:04:29] finish in in Hebrews chapter
[2:04:32] 2. Uh uh uh the message Hebrews chapter
[2:04:34] 2
[2:04:37] 1957 God could not suffer in
[2:04:42] spirit. He had to become
[2:04:44] flesh to feel the pain of the
[2:04:49] sickness. Are you sick? Do you have
[2:04:52] pain?
[2:04:54] tooth
[2:04:55] ache. Jesus felt
[2:05:01] it. Are you
[2:05:03] tempted and he feels
[2:05:07] squeezed? So he cannot
[2:05:09] overcome. He knows you cannot. That's
[2:05:12] why he failed it and he overcame it so
[2:05:13] that you two can overcome.
[2:05:18] That's why when you are
[2:05:20] squeezed your back is against the
[2:05:23] wall to him and tell him father help
[2:05:28] me. That's why it is important to be
[2:05:31] vulnerable. Father help me. I am
[2:05:36] helpless. sincerely you do it and
[2:05:41] then he'll come to
[2:05:45] you to feel the pain of
[2:05:48] sickness to feel. He came down in flesh
[2:05:51] to feel the temptation of
[2:05:54] [Music]
[2:05:55] lust.
[2:05:57] Lust. How many here know
[2:06:01] last? All right. You are very
[2:06:04] holy. All of you here have failed
[2:06:10] last. Jesus felt
[2:06:13] it. The temptation of
[2:06:17] lust. To feel the temptation of
[2:06:22] want. You want something
[2:06:26] but Jesus felt
[2:06:29] it. To feel the temptation of
[2:06:33] hunger. Hey.
[2:06:39] Lord, I wish I get that
[2:06:43] food to feel the power of
[2:06:47] death. Maybe you are listening to me
[2:06:50] today and you're so sick and you think
[2:06:54] you're going to die. You are feeling the
[2:06:56] power of death. He felt it too, but he
[2:07:00] overcame
[2:07:01] it. You too can overcome it.
[2:07:06] that he might take upon
[2:07:08] himself to stand in the presence of the
[2:07:11] great spirit
[2:07:14] Jehovah. He felt every one of those
[2:07:17] things so that he can stand before the
[2:07:20] spirit
[2:07:22] Jehovah the spirit not the
[2:07:25] man to the spirit to make intercession
[2:07:29] to this life. Amen. Amen.
[2:07:36] There is one God and one man
[2:07:39] Jesus the mediator between man and
[2:07:44] God. He mediates for us. He intercedes
[2:07:48] for
[2:07:49] us to this life. The blood speaks for
[2:07:54] us. And Jesus took that in order to make
[2:07:58] intercessions for us.
[2:08:01] He knows how it
[2:08:03] feels. Tell your neighbor. He knows how
[2:08:05] it
[2:08:08] feels. Go
[2:08:11] away. That's why when sometimes God
[2:08:13] wants a preacher to preach
[2:08:16] something, he will take them through
[2:08:21] something so they can preach what they
[2:08:25] fear. They have they can have compassion
[2:08:27] for the people.
[2:08:29] One time I think it was
[2:08:32] Hosea he he he desired a
[2:08:36] prostitute. God told him marry a
[2:08:40] prostitute. He could not have married
[2:08:42] her unless he desired
[2:08:46] her. So that so that God can use his
[2:08:52] life to preach to the
[2:08:56] Israelites. And when he was speak
[2:08:59] Thus say the Lord, you have left me. You
[2:09:02] have gone after other men. He felt
[2:09:06] it. It was
[2:09:08] personal
[2:09:10] because he felt it. He knew how
[2:09:15] it
[2:09:17] go. Hallelujah.
[2:09:20] That's why God had to come and be born
[2:09:23] in
[2:09:24] Christ to go through every
[2:09:28] temptation that you and I go through.
[2:09:32] And then he can say, "I know how it
[2:09:36] feels and I am here to tell you tonight,
[2:09:40] he knows how it feels."
[2:09:46] Amen.
[2:09:48] Amen. Yes. Let me try to bring the quote
[2:09:50] to a close.
[2:09:53] And Jesus took that in order to make
[2:09:54] intercession for
[2:09:57] us. When you are tempted, he knows how
[2:09:59] you
[2:10:00] feel. Did you ever notice when we vote
[2:10:03] for a
[2:10:05] president? Every farmer will vote for a
[2:10:07] president that's been a
[2:10:11] farmer. For he knows that he had a part
[2:10:14] of the farmer's life.
[2:10:17] He wants someone who
[2:10:19] understands. And before God could ever
[2:10:22] understand him being that great
[2:10:26] holiness, how could he ever understand
[2:10:28] after he condemned
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:32] man? By his holiness, he condemned man.
[2:10:36] But the only way you would ever know how
[2:10:38] to justify man to become a man.
[2:10:40] Hallelujah.
[2:10:49] Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. And God
[2:10:52] overshadowed the virgin and she brought
[2:10:53] forth a
[2:10:57] body, not Jewish
[2:11:00] blood, not gentile
[2:11:02] blood, but his got his own
[2:11:07] blood. Jesus was not a Jew.
[2:11:10] He was not a Gentile.
[2:11:12] He was not an American. He was not a
[2:11:15] black man. He was not a white man. Hey,
[2:11:18] he was not a red man. He was
[2:11:25] gone. Matter of fact, I can tell you his
[2:11:27] skin pigment was looking closer to yours
[2:11:30] right
[2:11:35] now. People of that time look like that.
[2:11:44] He had the blood of God in
[2:11:46] him. God is created
[2:11:49] blood. No sexual
[2:11:55] desire in his blood and this blood
[2:11:59] cell in the womb of this
[2:12:03] woman brought forth the son. Let me
[2:12:06] correct that. He's saying he did not
[2:12:09] he's not saying that he did not have
[2:12:10] sexual
[2:12:13] desire. He's saying that the way he was
[2:12:18] born, it was not through sexual
[2:12:21] desire, it was God's creative blood
[2:12:27] cell in the womb of this
[2:12:30] woman that brought forth the
[2:12:33] son. And when he was baptized by John
[2:12:36] the Baptist,
[2:12:38] John said, "I bear
[2:12:39] record see the spirit of
[2:12:43] God like a
[2:12:45] dove coming down and abinding upon
[2:12:50] him." God came
[2:12:52] down in this body of
[2:12:56] flesh. No wonder Jesus could say, "All
[2:13:00] powers in heaven
[2:13:02] are given to my heart."
[2:13:06] Imagine the power Jesus
[2:13:10] felt. If at all he had used
[2:13:12] it, hey, we would not have been
[2:13:15] saved. But the Bible says, "Let this
[2:13:18] mind be in
[2:13:20] you." Ephesians 2 as us in Christ
[2:13:25] Jesus who being in the form of
[2:13:30] God will not rob to be equal with God.
[2:13:36] But he took upon himself being found in
[2:13:38] a fashion as a man. He took upon himself
[2:13:40] the form of a
[2:13:45] [Music]
[2:13:47] servant and he humbled
[2:13:49] himself even to the death of the
[2:13:52] cross. What are we talking about?
[2:13:56] God just humbling
[2:13:59] himself. God and man became one.
[2:14:03] Heavens and earth embraced
[2:14:05] him and he was the one who can give
[2:14:08] reconciliation for our
[2:14:12] sin. That is the reason that in his
[2:14:16] name healing takes
[2:14:20] place. He knows your
[2:14:23] pain. And if you're sick, hear the sound
[2:14:25] of my
[2:14:26] voice. I said be healed in the name of
[2:14:29] Jesus.
[2:14:33] Amen. If you receive it with all your
[2:14:34] heart and say
[2:14:36] amen, your pain will
[2:14:39] disappear. Your tumor will disappear.
[2:14:42] Your sickness will
[2:14:44] disappear. Amen. Amen. Glory to
[2:14:48] God. I believe he was a God man. Believe
[2:14:51] start this in the message that he says I
[2:14:52] believe he was a God
[2:14:55] man. He was more than a man.
[2:14:58] He was the divine one that God sent from
[2:15:01] out of
[2:15:04] heaven. I know he cried out like a man
[2:15:06] when he was dying at the
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:10] cross. Raining rocks and darkening
[2:15:14] skies. My savior bowed his head and
[2:15:18] died. That's right. He was a man when he
[2:15:23] was dying. But when he rose on the third
[2:15:26] day, he proved that he was
[2:15:29] God. That's right. God was in his
[2:15:34] son. He raised him up. He was
[2:15:39] divine. Musicians can come. He was
[2:15:43] divine. I believe every word
[2:15:49] of He was a good man.
[2:15:55] You are a God
[2:15:59] man.
[2:16:01] Amen. Don't you worry about what you
[2:16:05] feel in the
[2:16:06] body. Amen. The body is a man. The body
