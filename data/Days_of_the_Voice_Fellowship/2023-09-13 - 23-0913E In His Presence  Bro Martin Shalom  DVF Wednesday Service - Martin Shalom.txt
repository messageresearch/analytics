me that the Lord will speak to your heart yeah as you always say that standing here has never been easy it is just the masses of the Lord amen amen [Music] foreign of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him foreign foreign [Music] in a room is blessed be the name of the Lord yeah this evening we are going to have something that I want us to share and it is the message in his presence amen Amina Hallelujah Hallelujah in his presence okay it's such a wonderful thing to be in the presence of the Lord and the days we are living in we ought to be so close in his presence blessed with the name of the Lord be in the presence of God it is not just sitting in church [Music] goes beyond that blessed with the name of the Lord and where we have read in Sir John chapter 14 which Jesus said in verses 21. amen we can begin from 16. he said and I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the spirit of the truth whom the world cannot receive because it sees him not neither norith him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you in secretions [Music] praise be to God the spirit of the truth whom the world cannot received amen amen so they are telling us they have the truth but the truth is not outside there the truth is in the word of God and yet Jesus says that when he goes he will send another come he will send a converter of the truth whom the world cannot received do you know why the world cannot receive the spirit of the truth the answer is because it is saved him not neither knoweth but you know him you know him amen for he dwareth with you [Music] the most important thing is God dwelling in you because the Bible says amen the Bible says [Music] bless every the name of the Lord amen I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you that is a promise that is our inheritance God promises he will never leave us comfortably [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] God is weak [Music] the only way God can display his power is when God gets our body to dwell in blessed in the name of the Lord that's why when Jesus cast the demons they requested him that allowed us to go and enter in those hugs [Music] when demons are just Meandering around they are weak the only way they can display their power is when they're in the body blessed me the name of the Lord brother try to work on this sound very fast and yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but you'll see me because I live you shall also live a cigarette [Music] [Music] [Music] and he that has my commandment and keepeth them he is in that love with me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him Jesus manifests himself yes he revealed himself [Music] when the church keeps the Commandment of God Jesus says he will reveal himself to them yes how does Jesus reveal himself yes foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] Bible which [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] the presence of God comes through prayer and first reading the word and living for God [Music] the Bible tells us that God is spirit and those who worship God if you are to worship God worship Him in spirit and Truth foreign prayer is not exactly prayer is not exactly uh bringing God down to manage you hear that it is do you want to go up to God just go in prayer that is the only way that is the Rock at which we lift you to God Amen and why do we need to get closer to God why do we need to watch when we are in the presence of God things happen miracles happen salvation take place [Music] when the presence of God came down something took place the Bible says that is where the presence of God will do in your life when the presence of God comes down amen desert will Blossom feeling will take place [Applause] and as you pray foreign through a Christian serious Christians why what it is because of this amen because at home your opinion your heart is hearing to be in the presence of God to come and commune that's why the prophet 30 minutes and when you enter in 30 minutes before the Salvation you don't just sit and fall back your hands [Applause] praying to God [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] of Prayer prayer is just beautiful you pray today you pray the next days each time you pray something is happening one which again imagine that is what I know with prayers we have been praying for years and years sometimes you go in the bush sometimes you go in the mountains [Music] amen you need to have some quiet time with the Lord amen [Applause] cannot feel cannot see her blindness before the Lord it is only the Saints when you find someone who feel is okay to begin with that person is a sinner because Amazing Grace [Music] amen when God comes down he will show us our our Falls [Applause] [Applause] blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina praise the Lord we need that presence we need that Grace in our lives we should not allow that conviction to die a Christian you must have a conviction even Sinners they have convictions blessed with the name of the Lord they all know we can keep moving in this journey foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] waiting for the Rapture and at the same time and by the grace of God God sent us the message not for us just to brag about him he was the prophecy Jeremiah and he says he knew yeah by the prophecy of Jeremiah blessed with the name of the Lord we are the generation amen blessed with the name of the Lord [Applause] chapter 3 [Applause] [Applause] he's a king foreign [Music] and they come not Jet and they give us a good way bless the Lord that's not preachers who preach until you become uncomfortable and you are sick in the world today blessed with the name of the Lord sometimes we bring teachers blessed be the name of the Lord but all is for the Perfection of the Bride blessed the prophet say that I want his presence may God look down now and fill each one of your heart full of his presence you better get rid of the things amen you can't go behind the holness of holy trust someone again the government that the high priests were in there had to be made out of holy hands are selected Goods ordained of God it has to be a god-selected rope amen Mina do you know that God selected rope he's the Holy Ghost yeah it is [Applause] himself in the presence of God [Music] the thing of it is that people my brother sister and friends is to be conscious of your littleness and don't be conscious don't be conscious of how big you are they were the words be conscious of how little you are well blessed be the name of the Lord's presence is so sensitive that's why even we Christians we ought to be very careful [Music] they will tell you when the judges are presence will come you are not even allowed to scratch that itching point of views they will beat you up oh blessed in the name of them that is in the devil's dungeons you have to be conscious that is there ah to worry how about in the presence where some time where the uh we're in church when God is speaking to his children an angel when the angels are here and you're busy on your phone are you conscious of God's presence [Music] do you know that same God um is the same God we are serving today amen do you know that throughout has never changed blessed with the name of the Lord the Bible says he receives Glory alone why do you think people get that courageous even to be chatting when they're in charge it is because they are not conscious of the presence of God because they are not in God's presence in the name of the Lord the Bible tells us to seek the presence of God he never went somewhere else but he knew there is something about being in his presence and when he came in his presence he started praying yeah for the grace of God Amen and when the presence of God came down he was the prophet he had in a big Major Prophets and communicated by God Amen where the presence of God came down yeah now your Prophet has come captain today they are going to see me not with Isaiah when he broke into the vision Brethren that vision is still real even today because the Bible tells us [Music] Some Dream went there to him when they're hanging themselves not dreaming you are late Grand grandfathers foreign [Music] [Applause] it is also Vision negative vision it tells the vision but seeing spiritual vision my brothers my sisters blessed with the name of the Lord when Isaiah went to the temple again when he was in the presence of God and God will started revealing to Isaiah the way he was looking like he was even dwelling amongst the people with unclean leaves in the king's palace men and women blessed with the name of the Lord foreign [Music] [Applause] that is what happened to that on the day of Pentacles what happened there when the day of Pentecost was fully counted there came a sound of a mind now watch what was that charity that was the presence of God and when the brothers came and and possessed them they preached the gospel in another fashion and they hear us were pricked in their hearts the presence of God and what the church needed today amen that is what we need when the prince of God is in on me you will not struggle with people to clap their hands you will not fight with them to live right the presence of God will do the meaningful praying God is sorrow in the house of men and women yes [Music] you cannot receive the Holy Spirit when you are busy judging your friends about nonsense you every time when you're on phone you're watching muhanji and uh and these are men and women who are abused they are possessed with demon of obesity yes sir blessed with the name of the Lord the praise of God in our mission foreign we will see that the Rapture is so close the reason asked why you will hardly hear the Pentecostal preaching about the coming of the Lord because the presence of God departed from them it is [Applause] to perform on their platforms to entertain their people demons in the world people entertain demons in their belief so-called Believers amen they are no longer preaching about the second coming of Christ they are preaching about worlds those things they are good but if you are not careful will end up becoming religious people also blessed with the name of the Lord if we don't listen to the word if we don't pray brother sister we are not immune without um what keeps you it's only the presence of God there is an answer we don't pray for others in the seat for your brother and by your sister foreign yeah brother we are going to pray you together and then they say how many prayed for me blessed of God you cannot plan you forget science blessed be the name of the Lord amen he says that the government that the high priest were in the hand okay we have read that quote we find that John Hammer himself the Press of God is my brother my sister and Friends be conscious of your littleness don't be conscious of how big you are foreign [Applause] family in the book of us because Peter asked him is this all that you saw that was opportunity foreign foreign [Music] sanctify themselves that never know it's a fool satania have come after and comes tinkling shoes and they said today chameleon is going to sample us blessed with the name of the Lord amen the praise of God brings Holiness it brings seriousness it brings discernments when that presence comes down we see things differently foreign [Music] there is too much pressure in the world there's too too much a lot is happening and if the church is not careful a connection we're taking the result we may be drifted from the truth twins blessed be the name of the Lord amen Amina in a message going beyond the calm the prophet says and in his campaign it was almost every day occasion that Abram met God don't talk to him not only that when they went down in the great uh in the in the garage we find out earlier that God was in the camp with our marriage and today they live in their own come they haven't got nothing to do with God Has Come On which club do you live in today brother sister let us leave in the cup of God's presence stop running a man running from the presence don't get out of his presence okay just move up into his presence amen listen we have got to learn the presence of the sun we have got to be ripened how the church need to learn his presence you know and get sweet in the press in the spirit so that it can bathe foreign you are part of it praise be to God you are because the bride the brightest part of the Bride is a part of the Grooms so we find out that it's the same thing she will do just exactly what was predicted of her to do in this day um not by no means but she will be on fire thank God is the part of the group we cannot be something different it is foreign [Applause] if you are the part of the prize [Applause] on fire for God the great warrior he told them choose this day whom you are going to serve [Applause] the Lord we are not going to be neutral foreign [Applause] foreign [Applause] brother matter is scaring us no but you must reach somewhere or you know and make a decision great and clear decisions you will regret why you never solved the holy ghosts praise be to God this is Life Soul Saving business when the government is trading his soldiers government will written the kamaji they don't play with them my father told me she thanked a young number when you go where the training commanders they use life plates because your enemy will not come with rubber bullets that is the police I think whom they use those are the people who go for covert operations [Applause] and when make sure they don't arrest you if you'll be arrested we don't know who are fighting with the demons how do you think we're going to overcome the devil okay now I'm gonna sit down with you another bullets young women [Applause] [Applause] blessed in the name of the Lord they must know what they stand before the devil is not your friends amen Amina don't be deceived the devil is just looking for the way of finishing you at once you go to your dirty things yeah and you'll be on front page the one without dust there is a young man I want to see brother true isn't this brother Cube probably the reason maybe they are twins brother it is impossible maybe his twin brothers foreign [Music] praise me to God this life is full of trouble I am full of struggles full of problems don't think that when you're saved hindrance in this life it is the presence of God praise be to God amen Amina let us Shake ourselves from the dust of flowers the Bible says they shall rise and shine why are we not shining when our light has gone let us arise and shine let us run with the world let us live the life word of the Gospel praise be to God foreign you know sometimes when you sit in church they are Corners which personally cannot see it you better sit in the main corners but when you sit next to a cold brother even that little light baby praise be to God amen I mean when the Holy Spirit comes it has not only quickened our spirit weaken each and everything about it you know having the Holy Spirit it stays the same as knowing whether when you die right now you are going to find two roads we did ask whether in the sky or down the one which is dirty with thorns and and into the express Highway Express and we wish to close what to console ourselves I will just take this one full of thorns this is the road you can know if you die now where you are going oh you know yourself and where you are sitting remind me but if you have been speaking the word of God we are very sure that when you die in a way we are quick and up in the presence of God if you are part of the pride you are because the pride is part of the grooming blessed with the name of the Lord you see the Holy Spirit has been spoken about until we think it's now normal not until you receive the Holy Ghost foreign [Music] if we are going to get anywhere tonight hours if not we are going to be overwhelmed by troubles [Applause] you may be a homosexual in a church you may be selling yourself in the middle of the church secrets you may be selling while you're in the middle of the church what make a cat it is the Holy Spirit and that is the new birth forgive me I've been doing so and so so what is going to prevent us as I said we are not immune Community [Applause] we are making one big fireman we should never ever lose the presence of God in our lives [Music] praise be to God she'll be on fire for God she'll be moving on the spirit of God just live for God and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshing his presence amen [Applause] just live for God live and pray every day God Will Take Care of the rest and when the church get to that place where in the presence of God listen when the church get to that place where that Christ means so much to us that will refer us to get in his presence each other life is giving resource life-giving resources in the presence of God where that cross means so much to us that we first get in his presence of God foreign and let me live Holy Spirit that is all we need well in the presence of God go take care of the rest okay but one who speaks about a man called Charles Finney 45. he was praying he was most of the time was in prayer blessed be the name of the Lord amen and he says this man he was preparing for the service and you know what happened he got a speaker and he wanted to check whether the sound was okay he got hold of the microphone bless the name of the Lord I was looking for that quote I'm looking for that quote in the message in his presence okay let me first quote with this he said that when we come to church and talk and praise God and so forth but oh brother when we see him coming something different something will be different in our hearts we might think we do our religious duties between the laws by God church we might think that we keep the laws of the church but once let us get a look at him the whole thing changed yes it is [Music] the way I'm going to finish with the squat here he says Gamba amen praise the Lord [Music] but yeah in this message the prophet talks about Charles Finney he said this man who was in the presence of God and he prayed amen it was in prayer waiting to preach in that rephire and say that they were when they were it was testing the minds [Music] [Applause] one fell off from the platform he said that is what is being the presence when we are in the presence of God many things happening and that's what we need to walk in the presence when we're in his presence we move with a period of fire and God has always desired us to be in his presence and that's why he tells us to walk in the spirit because he knows when we are living in the space we are living in another world and we are walking hand in hand with the heels foreign [Music] the Lord God for me everyday [Music] [Music] it says foreign [Music] [Applause] don't enter in Christ tonight it will be woe unto us [Music] it will be so bad [Music] who knew the truth yes amen
