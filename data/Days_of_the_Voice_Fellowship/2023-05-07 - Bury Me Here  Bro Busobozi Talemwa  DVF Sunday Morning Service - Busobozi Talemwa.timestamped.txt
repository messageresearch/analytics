[32:40] Zimbabwe I was really encouraged but
[32:42] again that is Zimbabwe in South Africa
[32:45] very encouraged spiritually

[33:17] going to preach today to you uh when I
[33:19] was in the city of Bulawayo in Zimbabwe
[33:21] is
[33:27] for what I'm going to preach today
[33:32] um so I thought we had agreed by the
[33:35] margin that I will not be interpreted
[33:36] today but I don't know
[33:39] okay
[33:44] is there anybody who must heal Uganda

[33:54] okay

[34:47] I'll call him so Brother Martin be on
[34:48] standby so we are going to read a job
[34:51] Chapter 19 Verse 25.
[34:54] actually without an interpreter I'll
[34:56] even be faster and
[34:58] I trust

[35:02] 19.

[35:26] going to read up to verses 26 just two
[35:27] verses and then we shall be seated after
[35:29] prayer
[35:31] Okay so
[35:34] for I know that my redeemer liveth and
[35:36] that he shall stand at the latter day
[35:39] upon the Earth and though after my skin
[35:42] worms destroyed this body yet in my
[35:45] flesh shall I see God
[35:48] shall we pray Lord Jesus we have read a
[35:51] portion of your holy word this morning
[35:53] and we ask you Lord to just come now and
[35:56] give us inspiration give me inspiration
[35:57] Lord as I speak give me utterance and
[36:00] even the people Lord that Inspire them
[36:02] to receive these words as it is meant
[36:03] for them to receive you today granted
[36:05] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[36:08] you may be seated
[36:10] you see sometimes when we are praying uh
[36:13] to receive an inspiration from the Holy
[36:16] Spirit on what to preach about I don't
[36:18] just go to read oh I don't just go to
[36:21] study in the Bible or in the message on
[36:24] what to preach to you many times I've
[36:26] realized that when I I want to seek the
[36:29] inspiration of the Holy Spirit on what
[36:31] to preach about I just wait
[36:33] I wait upon him it's not only for this
[36:36] place for any other place I've been to I
[36:38] wait upon him and many times even when I
[36:40] went to Zimbabwe I had prepared a lot of
[36:42] summons that I I was going to preach but
[36:45] in almost each service the Holy Spirit
[36:48] gave me a different inspiration and I
[36:50] picked it up and preached it to them and
[36:52] maybe a new inspiration for them but
[36:54] this morning even for last Sunday and
[36:56] even this Sunday there is a thought that
[36:58] has been going on in my heart and I
[37:00] wanted to share it with you on the open
[37:03] door but somehow you see the Holy Spirit
[37:07] has not inspired me to go that direction
[37:10] and so last night as I was pondering and
[37:13] seeing whether to go that direction or
[37:14] this other direction then he brought in
[37:17] this inspiration again and this is what
[37:19] I'm going to talk about bury me here
[37:22] bothering me here and so tell your
[37:24] neighbor bury me here
[37:27] aha I hold your Uganda
[37:32] ah Pastor you're going to talk about
[37:33] body
[37:34] yes I'm going to talk about barringo
[37:38] some people fear death and some people
[37:40] fear by you and others when you talk
[37:43] about barrier they already feel their
[37:45] body tingling because they don't want to
[37:47] die
[37:48] or when they see a dead body they feel
[37:50] like oh this is the end of the world and
[37:52] they get sick some of them get sick some
[37:54] of them can't eat food for a while
[37:57] but I am so thankful that a Believer
[38:00] will die once and we cannot die the
[38:03] second time
[38:04] we die once
[38:06] and when the moment we we die and we are
[38:09] buried in the place I want to tell you
[38:10] today we can never die again and we can
[38:13] never be buried in any other place again
[38:15] the only place that the only thing that
[38:17] is remaining for us or for a Believer is
[38:20] resurrection
[38:22] now there are many things that people
[38:24] are being buried in today there are many
[38:25] many things in the world that the devil
[38:28] his purpose is to bury us in many
[38:31] different things and this reminds me
[38:34] what we uh brother Marvin shared on
[38:37] Friday with us who are not here on
[38:39] Friday you missed a great deal but I'm
[38:41] having shared a very powerful sermon a
[38:43] very powerful inspiration that God gave
[38:44] him and it was a blessing to us how many
[38:46] we are blessed on Friday night Amen Let
[38:49] us give a crap of praise to the Lord for
[38:50] that
[38:52] uh brother Marvin was a doctor last
[38:55] Friday uh yeah this Friday he was a
[38:59] doctor and he was examining our hearts
[39:02] you see and really God dealt with us
[39:04] very very well and we appreciate God for
[39:06] that but today after our hearts are
[39:09] examined we are talking about barriers
[39:11] so because
[39:12] if our hearts are examine and maybe we
[39:15] are dead then we have to be buried but
[39:17] in this case it's not a bad death it's a
[39:19] good death because the bad things are
[39:21] dying and the good things are leaving
[39:24] of course when you die there is a
[39:26] resurrection and many people when they
[39:27] get sick the first thing that they will
[39:29] fear is death
[39:31] ah what if I die
[39:34] but here is a man called job and job was
[39:37] a very wealthy man job was a very
[39:39] blessed man Joe body found the blessing
[39:42] of God found the grace of God in his
[39:44] life
[39:45] praise the name of the Lord
[39:47] where is Brother Martin
[39:50] okay call him up here to come and
[39:52] interpret the Holy Spirit told me there
[39:54] are about three people that must be
[39:56] interpreted here today and so I don't
[39:58] want to disobey the Holy Spirit aha but
[40:01] the matter I told you to be near so
[40:05] uh-huh so I'm going to wait for you now
[40:08] praise the name of the Lord
[40:10] how many love the Lord this morning
[40:16] all right so
[40:19] I've just obeyed the Holy Spirit don't
[40:21] feel bad about me
[40:25] here
[40:27] there are some people when they hear
[40:29] about death
[40:31] they feel bad but here is a man who was
[40:35] sick
[40:37] this man knew he was going to die
[40:40] again that this sickness was taking him
[40:43] to his grave
[40:45] and he had complained to God
[40:51] until he gave up and now his friends
[40:54] were telling him maybe you were a sinner
[40:56] a sacred sinner
[40:59] but you see this man was a seed of God
[41:04] let me tell you something about a seed
[41:07] a seed of God he can never die
[41:11] you can try to bury the seed of God in
[41:13] many things
[41:15] and the seed of God always shoots up
[41:18] afterwards
[41:20] a seed of God can never die
[41:23] a seed of God
[41:33] the moment we are born
[41:35] the devil always envisions to bury us
[41:41] into the things of the world
[41:46] the things that decay
[41:49] some of you we are battered in those
[41:52] things
[41:53] the purpose of the devil was to do that
[41:57] to bother you in this school
[42:00] to bother you in alcohol
[42:06] to bother you in the things that are in
[42:10] this world
[42:11] the Bible summarizes into the three
[42:14] things
[42:16] the last of the flesh
[42:19] the pride of life
[42:21] and the last of the eyes
[42:25] see the Bible summarizes all the things
[42:27] in the world under those three things
[42:32] in the Book of Genesis
[42:34] the devil tried to bury the Adam and Eve
[42:38] in those things
[42:40] you remember when Saturn came to Eve
[42:44] and he told her all those three things
[42:50] is good for the flesh is good for the
[42:54] eyes
[42:57] and so the devil was trying to buy the
[43:00] heart
[43:02] in the last of the Flesh in the pride of
[43:05] life in the last of the eyes
[43:09] when Jesus came on the scene yes we are
[43:12] they never knew and Jesus was a city yes
[43:17] do you know that Jesus
[43:23] the devil could not lava
[44:24] [Applause]
[44:48] for now
[44:53] that's the last of the eyes
[44:55] Jesus yes was supposed to die on the
[44:58] cross
[45:00] in order for him to have all the
[45:03] kingdoms of the world
[45:05] they never knew that
[45:07] he had to go through suffering he had to
[45:11] go through self-sacrifice
[45:14] and then to die
[45:20] and get everything
[45:22] but the devil come to him
[45:25] before he died before he went to the
[45:36] crossbow to me
[45:38] for just one second
[45:41] and I'll give you everything
[45:44] the lust of the eyes
[45:46] see the devil tried to bother Jesus
[45:53] but Jesus refused
[45:56] Jesus could not yes we are gone because
[45:59] he was The Incorruptible sin
[46:01] [Applause]
[46:02] how many times Millennium has never
[46:05] tried to bury us
[46:08] but why are you here this morning
[46:11] because the devil cannot bury you in
[46:13] those things
[46:16] he can try us when he cannot bother you
[46:20] in those days
[46:21] because you have a seed of God in you
[46:25] that seed can never die yes
[46:37] amen Jesus refused to be buried nothing
[46:39] yes
[46:44] all right I will take you he took him
[46:48] right now
[46:51] and he told him
[46:55] look I want you to fly

[47:04] that he will send his angels
[47:08] that you will not even allow your feet
[47:14] did you hear that scripture that the
[47:16] devil quoted um
[47:20] and Jesus knew yes that is true
[47:24] but not when it is coming out of the
[47:26] Devil's Mouth
[47:32] that the devil tells you out there are
[47:34] actually true
[47:38] but it is a trap
[47:41] to destroy you
[47:44] somewhere
[47:47] and Jesus understood that and they said
[47:51] you are trying to trap me
[47:54] in other words Jesus Saturn was telling
[47:57] us Jesus
[48:00] do you know you can fly or why don't you

[2:22:27] [Music]
[2:22:34] foreign if you're doubting that
[2:22:38] sacrifices
[2:22:42] it's better not to pledge anything

[2:22:55] it is better not to pledge
[2:22:58] than to say that not every heart every
[2:23:02] Sunday
[2:23:03] I'm going to give a hundred thousands
[2:23:06] and they don't give nothing even
[2:23:10] God detests that

[2:23:22] whatever you have pledge
[2:23:24] please fulfill your pledges

[2:24:36] from the first day of our pledges
[2:24:40] myself and my wife plagued an amount
[2:24:43] every month
[2:24:47] we've had a lot of financial challenges
[2:24:53] but there is no man that has passed
[2:24:55] Maybe
[2:25:08] see my wife my wife text her pledged
[2:25:11] from her budget her monthly budget
[2:25:13] please
[2:25:15] and she told media if I have to feed you
[2:25:18] beans
[2:25:23] and she pledged 200 000 every month
[2:25:27] I don't know how she squeezes it out of
[2:25:30] there
[2:25:32] I'm still feeding us at home
[2:25:35] but it's a sacrifice
[2:25:38] so you you saved and you bought a phone
[2:25:41] of 450 out of your
[2:25:44] foreign
[2:26:11] [Music]
[2:26:25] I'm telling you members of my family
[2:26:27] member of family so you can know that
[2:26:29] this is the sacrifice
[2:26:33] and I hope that each of us could catch
[2:26:36] the vision you know
[2:26:40] how many saw the newsletter I gave
[2:26:43] um
[2:26:45] how many I've been able to say that PDF
[2:26:48] with pictures on my mission trip yeah
[2:26:50] one person there with my mission trip to
[2:26:52] Zimbabwe how many saw it
[2:26:56] those of you who have not seen it I
[2:26:58] presume you are not online

[2:27:53] whenever I go there I'm challenged
[2:27:55] that church was built at a time of a
[2:27:59] Great Recession in Zimbabwe

[2:28:16] collected money they collected money and
[2:28:18] they built now
