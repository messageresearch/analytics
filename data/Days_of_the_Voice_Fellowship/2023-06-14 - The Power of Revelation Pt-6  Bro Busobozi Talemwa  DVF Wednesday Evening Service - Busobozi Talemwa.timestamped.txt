[35:38] [Music]
[35:39] so that's where we are beginning from
[35:47] I've I've been asked by Brother Jason
[35:50] Molina to speak to evening light bright
[35:53] Tabernacle as well Oregon Jason
[35:56] evening
[36:02] be listening to this
[36:06] [Music]
[36:12] and we trust that this will be a
[36:14] blessing to all of us tonight
[36:19] amen I'm reading out of the Book of Luke
[36:21] chapter 7 verse 36. look guys
[36:25] and one of the Pharisees desired him
[36:28] that he would eat with him and he went
[36:30] into the Pharisees house and sat down to
[36:33] meet and behold a woman in the city
[36:36] which was a sinner when she knew that
[36:38] Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisees house
[36:41] brought an alabaster box of ointment
[36:44] foreign
[37:03] and stood At His Feet behind him weeping
[37:06] and began to wash his feet with tears
[37:08] and did wipe them with hairs of her head
[37:10] and kissed his feet and anointed them
[37:13] with the ointment
[37:22] videos
[37:31] he spoke within himself saying this man
[37:34] if he were a prophet would have known
[37:37] who and what manner of woman this is
[37:39] that toucheth him for she is a sinner
[37:43] is
[37:46] [Music]
[37:56] and Jesus answering say that to him
[37:59] Simon I have someone to say unto thee
[38:02] and he saith Master say on yes
[38:12] there was a certain creditor which had
[38:14] two debtors the one old 500 Pence and
[38:17] the other 50 and when they had nothing
[38:19] to pay he frankly forgave them both tell
[38:22] me thereof which of them will love him
[38:25] most of
[38:28] [Music]
[38:31] um
[38:35] [Music]
[38:42] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[38:47] he to whom he forgive most and he said
[38:50] unto him thou has rightly judged
[38:58] [Music]
[39:02] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[39:04] Simon see as thou this woman I entered
[39:08] into thy house thou gaveth me no water
[39:10] for my feet but she has washed my feet
[39:12] with tears and wiped them with the hairs
[39:15] of her head thou gavest me no keys but
[39:18] this woman since the time I came in has
[39:21] not ceased to kiss my feet my head with
[39:23] oiled out it is not anoint but this
[39:25] woman has anointed my feet with ointment
[39:28] whatever I say unto thee her sins which
[39:31] are many are forgiven for she loved much
[39:34] but whom little is given the same loveth
[39:38] leader
[40:12] [Music]
[40:17] [Music]
[40:20] and this is what Jesus Christ spoke and
[40:23] he spoke first Simon and told Simon the
[40:27] woman's sins are forgiven yes yes
[40:37] and he said unto her
[40:46] let us read the last two verses
[40:52] themselves who is this that forgiveth
[40:55] sins also
[40:56] and he said unto the woman thy faith
[40:59] has saved thee Go In Peace
[41:02] [Music]
[41:11] [Music]
[41:21] So this evening by the grace of God I'm
[41:23] dealing with the power of Revelation one
[41:26] more time
[41:31] the local church here will be part six
[41:36] and I know I've shared this already on
[41:38] the zoom with the Saints at evening
[41:40] light so this might be I think part two
[41:43] or three of that is
[41:49] on this subject and so
[41:53] um I promise that I would now deal with
[41:56] this subject of this woman with the
[41:58] alabaster box
[42:16] but without faitha
[42:22] this is impossible to praise him
[42:25] but without faith
[42:28] one more time but without faith it is
[42:32] impossible to please
[42:34] himself for he that comes to God
[42:41] must believe
[42:43] that he is
[42:45] if you come to God
[42:48] it is a must
[42:50] it's not an option
[42:52] it is a must
[42:55] for you to have faitha
[42:59] or else you're coming to God it will be
[43:01] in vain
[43:03] cartoon and if you come to God believing
[43:07] then he is a rewarder yeah
[43:12] to you that diligently seeks
[43:16] so we know this and we've noticed over
[43:18] the time now that faith and we don't
[43:21] need the 12 years
[43:24] and I will keep saying this until the
[43:26] Holy Spirit takes it off of my heart
[43:35] and he kept on talking about job on the
[43:38] on the hip of us
[43:48] and one person one day asked
[43:52] when are you going to take job out of
[43:54] the earth
[43:57] and he said but he told the congregation
[44:00] but you remember
[44:01] when time was right on
[44:05] [Music]
[44:26] so because
[44:28] God brings spiritual food in this season
[44:32] [Applause]
[44:37] sometimes if it is not supposed to come
[44:40] from this mouth
[44:43] I can even prepare myself and God bring
[44:46] somebody else
[44:48] so he knows when to bring what to bring
[44:51] to you
[44:54] this evening this is what he has brought
[44:57] to you
[44:58] and I wanted to open your eyes
[45:08] it is impossible to please
[45:11] you can never please God no matter what
[45:14] you do
[45:15] this
[45:20] you can live right
[45:23] you can never please
[45:25] you can come to church every service
[45:28] foreign
[45:42] [Applause]
[46:28] foreign
[47:08] [Music]

[48:07] [Applause]
[48:14] look at a man and a woman
[48:17] to offer walks of faith
[48:24] has been moved by something
[48:28] that is beyond
[48:30] what is that called that is called
[48:34] Revelations
[48:42] she said faith is the revelation of the
[48:46] will of God
[48:48] is
[48:54] Faith is the revelation of the will of
[48:56] God
[48:57] [Applause]
[49:03] if you do well will you not be accepted
[49:07] don't see me but Cain was not accepted
[49:10] because he did not do the will of God
[49:13] what was the will of God the will of God

[51:24] require of us
[51:26] God requires us to have Revelation

[52:04] what I'm saying God himself
[52:32] no man talked to you

[52:42] of Revelations

[1:00:00] take you with me
[1:00:02] because you don't have the Revelation
[1:00:04] that I have
[1:00:06] I'm going to go up there because I have
[1:00:09] Revelation when you receive Revelations
[1:00:16] and takes you higher
[1:00:19] higher ground of faith
[1:00:22] and then when you reach there the man
[1:00:25] reached there with his little boy
[1:00:28] and the boys asked him
[1:00:33] as well
[1:00:44] foreign foreign
[1:02:03] amen the mind of Jesus Christ
[1:02:08] while he was there the boy asked him
[1:02:15] where's the sacrifice don't worry I
[1:02:17] gotta fire you in other words I know
[1:02:21] this is revealed to me God must provide
[1:02:24] us
[1:02:26] he didn't know that he had evidence
[1:02:34] it wasn't something he saw okay
[1:02:36] it was something he believed
[1:02:39] that faith is something you possess even
[1:02:42] when you can't oh God
[1:02:48] says I believe it
[1:02:56] the Bible says that they are going to be
[1:02:58] Overcomers
[1:03:09] that is going to overcome this
[1:03:10] generation
[1:03:12] and right there and then in that
[1:03:15] situation in that condition as
[1:03:18] bye
[1:03:24] there was a lamb
[1:03:26] that God had provided
[1:03:32] faith never fails
[1:03:36] many things will failure
[1:03:39] people will failure
[1:03:43] systems
[1:03:46] but Revelations
[1:04:15] there's a song We Sing only matter to
[1:04:17] him I believe God this is a cartoon I
[1:04:20] believe God
[1:04:21] it shall be done even as he says
[1:04:29] I believe I believe
[1:04:32] do you think it was easy for Abraham to
[1:04:35] believe God
[1:04:37] the hardest thing for him
[1:04:42] because he was going to lose his own
[1:04:44] only child
[1:04:46] but he did it and it was not without
[1:04:50] emotions
[1:04:53] it was not without emotion faith has
[1:04:56] emotions
[1:04:58] there was a motion throughout
[1:05:01] so you can't be a man of faith I have
[1:05:04] faith
[1:05:08] foreign
[1:05:20] [Music]
[1:05:37] imagine when he was taking the knife
[1:05:55] an emotion no time can never be put
[1:05:58] apart of each other
[1:06:02] that's why I was waiting for you this
[1:06:04] quote foreign
[1:06:13] foreign
[1:06:56] revelation
[1:07:31] foreign
[1:07:38] [Music]
[1:08:14] so Katie when you are stimulated
[1:08:16] [Music]
[1:08:18] cancer no one is
[1:08:26] and he won't mind
[1:08:28] he will still make his life
[1:08:31] people will look at him
[1:08:35] brother Dixon some will power water on
[1:08:38] him
[1:08:39] but he won't care
[1:08:44] because he's drunk
[1:08:48] joyful
[1:09:48] say the joy of the Lord is my strength
[1:09:54] stimulation of satisfactions the
[1:09:57] accumulation that is Vindicated
[1:10:00] but it has been proved
[1:10:03] praise the name of the Lord he says
[1:10:06] heart not the oil and the wine again
[1:10:11] what does the oil and the wine means
[1:10:14] the oil as we took it in Simba means the
[1:10:17] Holy Spirit
[1:10:18] [Music]
[1:10:20] Wine and the oil is connected together
[1:10:23] in the Bible in worship
[1:10:26] and the wine as we put that's where I
[1:10:29] got the idea the stimulation wine
[1:10:31] stimulates
[1:10:36] and type of it's natural from
[1:10:38] stimulation is revelation is
[1:10:50] revelation
[1:10:54] so why in the new wine would now the oil
[1:10:56] and the wine went together in sacrifice
[1:11:06] what is the oil
[1:11:09] the Holy Spirit what's the wine
[1:11:13] um
[1:11:17] the Holy Spirit and Revelations
[1:11:23] you can't do worship you can't do
[1:11:25] worship
[1:11:26] a God or you can't worship god without
[1:11:28] emotions
[1:11:30] have you seen have you ever seen the
[1:11:33] local worshipers
[1:11:35] that's worship their local goddesses and
[1:11:38] gods
[1:11:40] do they worship that God emotionless
[1:11:47] if you know what I'm talking about
[1:11:50] do they worship that God emotionless
[1:11:54] as a matter of fact they said
[1:11:58] the truth is they say that a demon has
[1:12:01] come on
[1:12:02] you find them pumping
[1:12:06] [Music]
[1:12:08] I think
[1:12:17] foreign
[1:13:29] foreign
[1:14:09] we are here
[1:14:14] there was a girl who had come to church
[1:14:19] the world was being passed
[1:14:25] I believe the Church of Christ Alone to
[1:14:28] be like the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:14:31] ought to be like that is
[1:14:33] whereby if they are sinners in the
[1:14:36] church
[1:14:37] Hallelujah man who are the Sinners are
[1:14:41] those that continue in sins contagious
[1:15:13] I want to be the first one
[1:15:17] hallelujah amen to catch the fire okay
[1:15:21] I don't know about you serious
[1:15:29] one person who has faith in the church
[1:15:33] May stand up and shout
[1:15:36] and from there another one
[1:15:38] let me tell you that's the kind of
[1:15:41] church that is the Church of the book of
[1:15:43] Acts
[1:15:45] the stimulation of Revelation
[1:15:49] now as oil symbolize the Holy Spirit
[1:15:54] then we find out that oil and wine is
[1:15:57] connected in worship
[1:16:01] always connected
[1:16:04] and the wine I said which come to me
[1:16:08] but the wine symbolizes power the power
[1:16:12] of stimulation by revelations
[1:16:16] and that's when something has been
[1:16:18] revealed
[1:16:21] Hallelujah man it gives stimulation
[1:16:28] because
[1:16:29] it has present it has been presented by
[1:16:33] revelations
[1:16:37] it is something that God has said
[1:16:42] it's a mystery they can't understand
[1:16:54] remember if the truth is revealed
[1:16:57] the truth is also Vindicated
[1:17:02] God constantly
[1:17:05] no matter how smart the person might be
[1:17:09] how brilliant it might be
[1:17:13] if God don't back up what he says
[1:17:19] there is something wrong foreign
[1:17:45] one day I watched a little video
[1:17:52] and this brother came from the mountain
[1:17:57] and spoke to a little young lady
[1:18:05] come from the mountains
[1:18:18] I thank God
[1:18:29] foreign
[1:18:56] it was a presumption
[1:18:59] we should never presume it's between
[1:19:02] activities that Revelation comes from
[1:19:04] the world
[1:19:06] be something different from what the
[1:19:09] Bible says
[1:19:12] the word of God is not for private
[1:19:15] interpretations
[1:19:50] then when it comes foreign
[1:19:59] is
[1:20:54] invite Jesus into their life away
[1:20:58] take him as a personal savior
[1:21:04] did you know there is more in him
[1:21:08] there is more joy
[1:21:10] there is more promises there is more
[1:21:14] blessings there is
[1:21:20] no you accept Jesus as your savior
[1:21:23] you are baptized but you never receive
[1:21:27] the Holy Ghost you are still taken by
[1:21:29] the things of the world
[1:21:30] the desires of the world are still in
[1:21:33] you
[1:21:33] see because you've not gone farther
[1:21:41] but because you've not gone fast
[1:21:43] he wants you to go further
[1:21:52] can we have that hunger you
[1:21:56] you may be in charge for 10 years
[1:21:59] they don't move an inch
[1:22:03] and come dictionary
[1:22:06] in just three months
[1:22:11] he completely goes deeper
[1:22:14] Brothers
[1:22:17] how he came in the church
[1:22:25] what is what does things like that
[1:22:27] church
[1:22:31] when God reveals to you something
[1:22:33] you catch it quickly
[1:22:36] Hallelujah I mean he is a woman
[1:22:40] and Simon invited Jesus
[1:22:42] but when Jesus came now whenever you
[1:22:46] invite Jesus
[1:22:47] he will always come yeah but here Jesus
[1:22:51] came and he was given a corner
[1:22:55] and they sat in a corner
[1:22:58] and the whole time
[1:23:01] Simon was entertaining his other videos
[1:23:08] giving them good seats
[1:23:11] anointing their head with us
[1:23:13] oh taking good care of them oh you are
[1:23:17] my business associate
[1:23:19] um
[1:23:36] where is Jesus yes
[1:23:46] why is Jesus in your life
[1:24:47] foreign Hallelujah
[1:24:50] here come Jesus yes sat in the corner
[1:24:54] right there in the corner but when this
[1:24:57] woman rushed she didn't look at others
[1:25:00] she just went straight yeah
[1:25:05] look at the rich guys
[1:25:10] what was that she was revealed to her
[1:25:14] Jesus
[1:25:18] she didn't stand on him
[1:25:22] Matula
[1:25:37] you know you're sitting there now
[1:25:40] that's it like a
[1:25:42] rocky worship Him the king of kings
[1:26:00] of Him in all situations
[1:26:19] because of our sins because of her life
[1:26:22] she brought the alabaster
[1:26:26] and broke it open very expensive
[1:26:31] on his feet
[1:26:43] and the woman is very busy on your feet
[1:26:49] and now it is very awkward right
[1:26:54] she didn't only do this she brought his
[1:26:57] feet

[1:27:01] she bought his feet I don't know whether
[1:27:04] Jesus had shoes
[1:27:08] so no there was no
[1:27:11] problems
[1:27:30] and this man doesn't know if he says he
[1:27:33] is who he is
[1:27:41] enjoying it
[1:27:45] he's also a human no name Glory
[1:27:52] [Music]
[1:28:54] she was able to wash his feet
[1:28:59] foreign
[1:29:39] there is something that happens when we
[1:29:40] worship by Revelation
[1:29:44] when you give up your Ambitions no why
[1:29:47] you know that's a worship when you give
[1:29:51] down your glory on the floor
[1:29:55] when you cry in his presence
[1:29:59] when you break down in his presence okay
[1:30:03] that is
[1:30:08] something that happens during that kind
[1:30:10] of worship
[1:30:13] she was a sinner she didn't even talk
[1:30:16] about her sins she was a bad woman she
[1:30:20] didn't even talk about her condition the
[1:30:23] only thing she did
