we handle everything a Hebrews chapter 13 Hebrews chapter 13 vers 4 praise God can we all read that verse together 1 2 3 we go okay some we are reading it maybe and then when they find some part which is a bit difficult they stop a bit and then they start again let us read it uniformly together without stopping 1 2 3 go marriage is Honorable in all and the bed and the F but wers and adulterers God will judge amen you may be seated so I want to greet you all in the precious name of Jesus uh this is our youth meeting number two we've had the first one last year we were gathered about I think 30 uh we don't remember the number nobody recorded but maybe 36 37 something like that and I'm told there are more than 40 others have just joined in so this meeting is very important because uh in schools they usually have uh what they call Senior teachers what else huh senior teachers and what else please I don't know why I'm not getting that counselors yeah senior teachers and counselors to be able to speak to the young people and then uh I don't know I don't um I think I attended one of those kind of meetings but usually in our school they used to separate girls and boys and then I don't know what they were telling girls that that the boys did not need to hear but in our meeting here at the church we we bring all of them together because we believe that the word of God can give us instruction that will help both of us together and uh really myself I do not although some especially when they hear me teaching they have considered me to I had one brother he called me he said ah brother I think you were a teacher I said uh you don't know what you're talking about I don't consider myself a teacher really uh so um there is a brother that really has a good teaching gift and he has Minister his ministry has really been a blessing to me in in that regard uh he's um from uh Ireland Ireland how many of you remember him brother uh what is his name yes I wanted to see that whether you remember or not his name is brother Andrew maray how many remember that in covid yes you remember how many remember him preaching to us teaching if you if you missed out you can go back on the I don't remember whether it is on this channel or on the first channel we are using but he is a very is a a very good teacher of the message and I think that uh him speaking to us can be a good blessing or you hearing him teach so I'm intending one of these days to invite him and I believe uh his ministry can be a blessing to us but meanwhile uh I'm your pastor and God has given me Grace to be able to uh be here and I I when I see something going wrong I need it to be corrected I want to guide you I want to make sure that things are done correctly and uh we know that we are a younger congregation starting out and there's a lot of marriages that are are going to come out but you see it has to come out to right most of your attention is now going to the other brothers why don't you keep your attention here brother Joel specifically yourself God God bless you because I I I want I have this bunch of questions part of it is talking about relationships and and marriage part of it is just doctrinal so because of time I will not go in details of bringing out every scripture on each some I'll just give an answer and if you feel not satisfied you can meet me and then I I I put more context to it but um I felt I needed to deal with this subject of marriage and a subject of fornication and I want to deal with it according to the message and that by the time we walk out of here each of us will know what we are expected of how we expected to do it even to some of you who are still younger and not ready for marriage you need to know so that you need to know how do we do it do we do it like everybody else or do we have a different way that we do it you understand what I'm saying so I I uh if you're going to keep quiet I would say nothing you need to answer me do you understand what I'm saying amen so we started out with Hebrews 13:4 it says marriage is Honorable in all now if you are married married you are going to be honored anybody who is married will be honored even marriage in itself is Honorable now I'm not going to talk about the subject of marriage in its deeper talk about relationships and all that how we are supposed to handle H as Believers but marriage in itself is Honorable um if in in some circles this thing needs to be reduced I don't know can someone help me come and uh reduce this ah I figured it out so um in some circles when people talk about marriage others I'll give you I'll begin with this example there's a younger man one time I think I was married but uh married maybe for about three years so I met this young man and I told him brother you are working he said yes I said brother you are of age you are now almost going to 30 years he said yes it is true why do you even mind I said brother I think you should think about marriage now he said look at this one we are thinking about we are praying about getting the Holy Spirit you are telling us about marriage what is wrong with you we should be talking about deeper things of God and you are bringing marriage why are you bring why are you people kindly minded what is wrong with you even you a minister I would have expected you to know better but you are telling me kind of things that brother was CAU red-handed in fornication you are now quiet so the question is was he spiritual or was he caral so sometimes when you don't think about marriage you are carel you find people growing especially boys growing 25 years 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 you know Jesus died at 33 so by the time you reach 33 you you getting expired almost but that's not the point the point is this by the time you are of age 18 years even the law of Uganda tells you by the time you become 18 years and above you are fit to get married did you know the laws of Uganda allow you to get married at 18 years did you know that how many is tired here today how many have eaten something and uh you are not so bad love so please respond to me I'm not preaching we are talking we having a conversation together so what was I saying someone reaches 18 years according to the government of Uganda you are fit to get married or to marri how many are 18 years and older here raise up your hand please if you are kindly I'm asking you to raise up your hand okay according to Uganda you can marry according to Uganda you are fit for marriage but not according to the laws of God the laws of God requires other things which we will look at but according to Uganda you are fit for marriage now how many are 17 17 and Below raise up your hand raise up up up up one two three now according to Uganda you cannot marry so according to our laws in this country it's not good for you to plan marriage now so if you are in any relationship you there is something wrong you understand so according to Uganda okay now when we come to the ways of God um marriage he says is Honorable marriage is Honorable in all and he says the bed undefiled meaning if you go to bed with someone that is not your wife or your husband that bed is defiled you yourself you are defiled we think that defilement what is defilement can someone explain to me what defilement is a good student a good student this is our small lit here please a good student come and Define for us what defilement is I'll pick someone at random don't let me pick you don't let me pick you h brother samel come come and and Define for us what defilement is what is defilement do you know what it is cuz I don't want to embarrass you you have heard of it so what is [Music] defilement okay for me defilement I understand it as like okay okay like I'm just going to give a scenario okay okay defilement is like destroying uh like let me say destroying your let me say your body with using Okay using okay by having these things of sex what to answer this question brother have you failed I have not failed you have not failed how many understood his explanation of defilement no one understood I want a sister who can help him a sister sister gift yes uhhuh Esther what is defilement yes H these are strong words but according to school this is true not so engaging into Affairs let me call it that way when you are below 18 years but according to God you have engaged in defilement if you are not married do you understand it's not according to God it's not age according to God it's when you are not married and you engage into such Affairs you have defiled yourself if you're 17 years and married according to God it's all right but if you are not married at 17 and you engag into such Affairs you are defiling yourself and defiling uh uh the bed but then he says war mongers and AD doubter us God will judge someone I said if you're 17 and said ah what what are you meaning that if you're 17 years according to the Bible you can't marry who says that you can't Mar if you're 17 well do you know that there are some countries who accept people to marry at 15 so can they not marry in our country it's not accepted as a government rule but according to some other countries they can even put it higher or lower it depends on the country but according to the ways of God the laws of God it is when you are married when you're married if you're not married you are defiling yourself you are a warmonger and you are an adulterer or fornicator and he says God will judge so there is no good words I have about fornication today and I wanted to talk about it about fornication in itself and then we shall get into these questions because this is um one of the biggest Temptation that uh is with the young people me when I understood it when I was from the time I was young I decided myself to keep away from it now I'm going to read you a few scriptures together with you I'll tell you to open you open we read quickly we go to another one let's go to Matthew chapter 15: 19 are you there if you're there say amen for out of their heart proceed evil thoughts murders adulteries fornications thefts false witness blasphemies so where does fornication come from out out of where out of their heart not every type of heart a heart that has not been born again a heart that has not been filled with the Holy Spirit a heart that has not been changed now there are certain things you can do please give me attention kindly I'm requesting there are certain things you can do and you say it was a mistake I did not mean to do it for example like what like what yes something you will do and you say ha it was a mistake yes sister when you are seeing something stealing something you can steal something and say you did not mean to do it like for example like what stealing like what a car yes my sister when you lie H like which kind of lie hey yes you come home late mommy asks you yes yes you say that you are being at a responsible place so that you will fear to be punished H when do you think of doing that that moment or by the time you were coming you were planning it all along you plan it uhhuh you see so that's not a mistake okay so I want you to tell me something you can do that is bad by mistake yes throw down someone by mistake yes maybe you are walking and then you you you you know you you know you trip over something and then you push someone by mistake and ha they fall down and then you say I'm sorry I didn't mean it right that's a honest mistake yeah that is a very good example now you see it's a honest mistake but also there are certain sins you can do by mistake for example like what yes my sister huh like a abusing ahuh for example give us an example you know someone someone slaps you and then you slap back and then you say hey I'm sorry or maybe someone speaks at you and then yet they are bigger than you and you also want to speak back and what was I going to do see I'm sorry you see but even even if you've not done it but you almost did it so it is almost done it's a mistake now there are many things you can do even others which we have not mentioned really even in some some some circumstances fortunate even You Can Tell a Lie by mistake certain lies not every type of lie sincerely by mistake when you did not mean it or plan it but somehow you are caught in a in a rock and a hard place and you have no way to to come out of it then you end up saying ah then you realize her by the way like brother banam for example brother banam he was he had not paid tax so he was in a house and um the tax people called him and uh H he saw the call he knew I have not paid I'm not these people are going to ask me for money so he says he he quickly runs out of the house and he tells his wife pick it up and tell them I'm not at home I'm not in the house was he in the house no so it was a very honest lie right so the sister picked up the phone he said he's not in he's not in the house so now but the heart smot him within him he said I lied to that to that man he and then when they brought him a child or children a child who was sick to pray over at his home as he was going to pray the spirit of God spoke to him he said but you are a liar I cannot hear your prayers you are a liar he said he told the person the parent of the child I'm sorry I can't pray for your child now but later so he picked up his his car and drove to this place where to the man where he was and he said I'm sorry sir when you called at home I was actually in the house but I had to go out and I asked my wife to lie on my behalf I'm really sorry I lied and the man said Mr Bram I've trusted you all these years but what you have done has made me trust you more you see uh it was a lie but by mistake but it was a lie still you can even say he was not inside house house so it was not a lie how many times have we told such lies and then we thought God will cover it up no problem you see you have to be honest with God now why did I say that there are certain things you can do by mistake and you didn't mean to do them but you do it anyhow and then you repent later but there are certain sins you cannot do by mistake one of them is fornication are you following me you cannot fornicate by mistake by all means you it cannot happen by mistake you see he said it is a matter of what of the heart it proceedeth out of the heart you see in your heart you plan it in your heart you envision it in your heart you even plan the day the time the place everything it begins there you look at a person you you you you you last after them and yet the Bible says that the moment you last after someone you have already committed a doubted with them in your heart but for you you do it and you're not condemned when you come in the church the word is going on you you don't repent of it it means you are not ready to correct your way so you see sin please listen sin begins in the heart things like fornication sins like fornication begins in the heart it is a matter of the heart and the reason why I'm bringing this Foundation is because I don't want you to be surprised on the next scriptures we are going to read on fornication what the Bible say speaks of it mhm are you following are you following I hope there is no fornicator here because you're are quiet I'm not preaching because you're fornicating I'm preaching because I don't want you to fornicate so if you are so quiet you will surprise me are you listening church so things like fornication you don't do it by mistake you plan it brother I don't want to use an example because it may happen to you so brother so and so is there he begins looking at someone he begins imagining now I wish this and this and that would happen and this and that and then he puts all that thing in his head in his heart rather and he begins to fantasize about it when he's sleeping he thinks about it and eventually it happens as a dream and then you see that dream you know for the devil to overpower you he will come in that realm of dream he will first overpower your subconscious when you are sleeping and then when you wake up you are like H that girl I've seen her in my dreams you will even begin to spiritualize it it means God has given that to me and then you you begin to fantasize it you begin to fantasize the whole thing and then the next moment you begin asking can I have your contact there that is why I come to that point to tell you that any younger man asking for your contact is potentially a criminal is any younger man you brother you know yourself if you asking a girl for a contact before you talk to your pastor it is a sign that you on your way to fornication that spirit is hunting you why who knows we've SE many of them you ask for this one's contact this one is contact this one is contact you have like 10 sisters you are chatting with back and forth and each of them you are not making any substantial move the sister is there waiting patiently for her maybe she's honest she's thinking this brother could be the real deal that I was praying for but the brother has never been the real deal the brother has another spirit in him his heart is moving over him the moment and you see you even look at the time he's texting you it is in the weird hours of the night the brother other things are going over his mind he's fantasizing maybe he dreamed even about you he will tell you I dreamed of you and then you're like what did you dream of you yeah I saw this and that he will try to smear it around no one has a business of dreaming about you before they get the proper license to begin cting you now we talk these things after we talk it then you go and do it and then they say we don't teach you correctly let me tell you this is what is happening in this generation that we are living in it is very difficult by the way it is more difficult than it was 10 years ago it is be increasingly becoming more difficult because you see technology is bringing the world in one place in just a moment you can talk to anybody anywhere and there is even No Boundaries there is no boundaries of bedrooms there is no boundaries of because I mean you can just do a video call with somebody you know they see my bedroom no one will ever know it's just on the internet somewhere you see and and these things you see what is happening the devil is cooking you up for something you see the whole time this is going on you come in the church they preach against it and you you feel a bit of ner in you maybe that was wrong oh God forgive me you come here you repent and then you go back and begin from where you stopped because in your heart you are not right with God you know that song which says if my heart is right when he calls me if my heart is right I hear so you can't hear the voice of God because your heart within you there inside you you are not right with God you see there is something pushing you to do wrong you know it but you're not willing to correct it or to undo it and then from there your heart is pushing you and then you continue the conversation and eventually an opportunity presents itself there are some of you who have not even done this act simply because you have not found an opportunity but if an opportunity presented itself oh my God oh my God you yourself you know you would be in TS so but what causes it this is something which can easily be aborted the Bible speaks about Sin and he says you see sin is conceived like a pregnan like you conceive a pregnancy you know like a woman conceives a child in the womb sin is conceived it begins as a desire he says that God does not tempt any man but a man is tempted by his own what by his own L this scripture is in the Book of James if you want it brother you can put it up for us on the screen a man is tempted by his own last you last after you know the girl or the boy these days even girls are lasting after boys brother bam said in one of the quotes uh if a woman dresses you know half naked you know men will last after her but if a man dresses half naked meaning wearing a sh ah he has like e e legs are like how did he call it like iron BS or things like that he says no one will will last after it but I'm telling you things are changing that qut is old things are changing if you some brothers here came in in shorts you would find sisters uncomfortable because things are changing it did not used to be the case it it used to be that boys even secondary schools boys were going in shorts not so but things are changing now you see girls these days they also last after boys seriously and seriously I'm telling you they even ask for their contacts you find a sister asking you brother can I have your contact and you gladly give it and vice versa that is already already a wrong act the moment someone asks for your contact from the blue it is already a red flag it is already a red flag I'm telling you Brethren it is already a red flag if you are talking now all of you who have phones you know if you are talking to a sister or sister let me tell you if a brother is talking to you currently and you're not aware whether their father or their Pastor is aware that they are talking to you it is a red flag it is most likely that that young man is going to lead you into trouble so I'm telling you that's a red flag because this person all the things are happening secretly he may even lie to you my pastor is already aware I talk to him confirm yourself confirm go to that Pastor or go to your pastor and tell them by the way brother so and so brother Dixon from dvf contacted me and he said that his Pastor is aware are you aware your pastor would say no I'm not aware okay I'll talk to his pastor and he will talk to his Pastor said no I'm not aware hey you already know you are trapped but what do you do you don't contact your pastor because you think you are safe and then eventually when they play around with you and your heart is broken then you begin crying around brothers from that church they are very bad but you yourself you're also bad you're to blame you see your heart you did not protect your heart from evil you see whoever contacts you and you you don't do due diligence you begin responding you begin answering you begin doing this and then automatically you find yourself entrapped in that kind and you know you will be entrapped I'm telling you because your heart is soft sisters protect your hearts your hearts are very soft protect them put a gate on the padlock don't allow anyone to come in without proper license sisters should say Amen to that but then you find then this brother they begin contacting they begin talking you see these boys of this generation are I'm sorry to use this word on the pulpit but it's the truth many of them not all of them I hope there is none here but many of them are Crooks I'm telling you the truth many of them are Crooks they are not serious Christians many of them are not sincere you know you find them contacting more than one sister and they they're not even deciding over who to choose and if you are among them and you are here you need the Holy Spirit I'm telling you you need to fight find God until you do that you will never find a wife because you cannot find a wife by trying this one trying this one trying that you are the type that I saw on the social media they put a mango and they said you see these people are just trying on every mango and then eventually they trying to find the right one all mango they have eaten a piece out of them you see so you are the one who is trying every mango every mango you are the one who knows that sister is good that one is bad that one is this but you did not choose any of them and you these days even younger men are one passing the rumors you find passing Tes the rumor to this one even a brother who would have potentially married you they will ruin him and his heart he will lose interest because of the rumor boys are moving rumors what type of men do are we going to to raise in the Next Generation in my generation you could not find a boy or a man moving rumors that is a Taboo it's an Abomination a man moving rumors it is it is UNS serious Brethren younger men we should you should be men of purpose you should be men who have a future you should be men who are planning great and bigger things when you begin as a sister the very first spot before you even do that we are going to come to that but now fornication is is planned in the heart this is something that does not happen by mistake that's why I'm I'm here to encourage you if you think that fornication will catch you it cannot catch you it can there is no way it can catch you unless you you you you are backers lead you first back SL before fornication catches you you cannot you cannot believe and follow the word and do everything the Bible saying and then be caught by fornication you'll be tempted to to go and do it but you cannot do it if you don't go in its areas and Realms are you following me now I'm I'm speaking to you not according to knowledge but according to experience and testimony because I know I've gone through it I've I've gone through my own share of Temptations but God sailed me through and I did not have any breezes which means it is possible and uh whenever we talk about this I understand there are some of course not all we can say that have lived virtuously some of you may be in one uh area of your life when you are not serious with God you found yourself trapped and ENT trapped and have walked that kind of life but you see let that be your past don't let it come in your present and say well I did it before nothing happened ah after you have come to the Lord and you want to continue doing it you will see what will happen you can't be the same you see if the moment you come to Jesus Christ then the Bible says all those that mention oh mention the name of Jesus they should depart from Evil you cannot mention the name of Jesus and still walk in the same old evil you used to walk in before you came to Christ you cannot you see the conversations you used to walk in before you decide you make a decision you see by the Christianity is a choice Christianity is a choice it is not forced it is a choice I hope there is nobody here forced to follow the Bible right it's a choice that you make and once you make a choice to follow Christ then leave the principles of Christianity and you will you won't find it hard to live a Christian Life okay let us read a few more scriptures about fornication uhhuh vers John chapter sorry sorry not John Acts chapter 15 verse 20 but that but that we write unto them that they abstain from what from pollutions of idols and from from fornication and from things strangled and from blood now meaning all these things are Abominations to a Christian to a believer you should abstain who knows what abstaining means sorry brother poap your city was supposed to be here you are seated in a wrong place your city is here kindly brother poap those places are for people who are already married they have just come to watch and see what is happening you come and sit here so sorry what is abstaining what does abstaining mean brother poap tell us what's keep away keep away God bless you abstaining is to do what keep away keep away meaning abstaining is to decide you can can you keep away from something unless you have decided to you decide first to keep away from something and then you will keep away he says abstain from fornication I'm reading you a few more scriptures on this matter and then he continues on and he says here in the book of um 1 Corinthians chapter 5 vers uh can someone read that for us oh brother put it for me on the screen 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse1 quickly now I need it on the screen I'm going to ask you to be putting the scriptures on the screen so if you are first it will help me it it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as it is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife what is the next verse what what does the next verse say yes read it get a microphone give him a microphone [Music] what is happening just uh [Music] okay and yet here pu up and have not rather moured that he that have done this deed might be taken away from among you what did he say ye that have done what and yet you are puffed up uhuh and have not rather mourned that he that had done this deed might be taken continue away from among you continue for I verily as absent in body but present in spirit have judged already mhm continue as though I was present concerning him that has so done this deed um let's go up a bit up a little bit uh that verse two and ye are paed up and have not rather mourned that ye that has done this deed might be taken away from among you I want to ask you a question do you know what they did for a person that fornicated in the Old Testament who knows what they do stoned killed physically murdered them H how bad would that would that have been before God God did not forgive people who had fornicated they were murdered they were killed done away with now it shows you how much God hated it defilement you see he hated it even more than he hated it is Li that they would separate somebody for a while until he is well right they would not kill aaper but they would kill a foror because God hated it and here in the New Testament Paul is saying you you have done fornication and you are still puffed up you you are still lifting yourself up you you are not having any remorse you're not you not apologetic you are not repentant instead of mourning and taking away these people from among you that have done this thing you've not done it you've not done it did you know that one fornicator in the church can bring in a thousand demons did you know that you literally walk into the church and many demons will be following you simply because you are sleeping around fornicating defiling yourself the Bible says don't you know and I'm going to read those scriptures Let Me Now quickly read don't you know that you're the temples of the Living God uhhuh let me show you let me show you how God hats this thing go to chapter 6 chapter 6 now chapter 6 vers 13 are you there uhuh brother Marin I don't expect you to uh shut this off keep it on and just keep going to the verses I want you to go to are you there yet chapter 6 1 Corinthians chapter 6 vers vers uh 13 meets okay you are there all right then read it just switch it on brother okay Ms for the belly and the belly for Meats but go is that aen Meats for the belly and the belly by the way you should eat any meats you want to there is no even we eat pork how many don't eat pork here ah we should prepare a pork Feast so you can learn how to eat pork I think we should prepare a pork fist one of these days pork is one of the sweetest Meats Hallelujah I hope you're not offended so you eat anything no problem as long as is received with Thanksgiving and prayer according to First Timothy okay continue Meats for the belly and the belly for the meats but God shall destroy both it and them mhm now the body is not for fornication but for the Lord and the Lord for the body Now read that last part now the body now the body is not for fornication uhhuh but for the Lord and the the Lord for the body the body is not for what but the Lord for what now did you know that when someone gets married I was sharing this in the married couples meeting the scripture says that your body the one who is married can I give you use as an example brother your body now is for the Lord Brother Andrew your body is for the Lord sister FIB thank you for coming your body is now your body now is for the Lord for the Lord only and you you are for the Lord and and and the Lord is for you but now when you get married you SE to have power over your body your body becomes your wife's and your wife's body becomes yours you have it as you want she doesn't have power over that body you don't have power over that body now that is for the married couples can we not go there but now to you who are not married the scripture says the body is for the [Music] Lord your body is for the Lord not for what not for what not for what church not for fornication uhhuh continue come on brother po your looking behind you're supposed to be continuing are you not the reading the reader or do you want us to get another reader yeah continue I want it to be fast and God and God has raised up the Lord and God have both raised up the Lord and will also raise up Us by his own power continue know not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then take the members of of Christ and make them the members of anot God forbid what no not that he which is joined to anot is one body okay wait before you continue who is a halot prostitute who is a prostitute who is a prostitute anybody has a good answer sorry someone who miss you please lift up your hand and then you just give us the answer who is a prostitute you know sometimes we take these things for granted that's why I'm asking who is a prostitute someone who is someone who miss their body sister do you have a different answer for everyone you have a different answer now I thought you were going to tell me someone who sells their body no even if you've not sold it if you sleep with somebody who is not your husband you are a prostitute what I'm with I know what I'm dealing with you know when you go to a doctor he knows what medicine to give when it is required so my brothers and sisters I know what God has told me to deal with please can you allow me to deal with it don't rush me let us deal with this according to scripture he's he's talking about a harot and I just told you a hot is someone who sleeps with somebody you don't flee fornication like that you flee like brother Solomon you have to do it energetic you don't even think twice you don't look twice that's why Believers Brothers let me tell you how to flee when you are walking on the road it is all over us you not going to to people are walking naked every day right almost you find them wearing their pajamas on the road what are you going to do huh are you going to be burning the whole time because you saw them and you a Believer what are you going to do yes even for people as young as Billy Paul I know what I'm talking about I'm a pastor I meet these younger people and they tell you things and you get shocked surprised what are you going to do when you find them naked walking on the road the moment you were walking you see them of course the first seeing was by mistake go back to what we started with but if you go back and say what did I see you are gone actually when you reach home begin repenting asking God to wash you because you have already committed fornication in your heart you see that's what that's where the first you see if you're a child of God you will be judged in your heart to begin with before you even ever try to do the act now how do you flee if you look once go don't look twice if you feel that your your head is so heavy you are working with a brother come here brother you're walking with a brother and your head is so heavy you want to turn again tell the brother brother hold my head this side please hold it keep my head this side I'm trying to look turn turn The Other Side now you you are holding my shoulders hold my head I'm turning but brother hold it at least a brother should hold it you understand God bless you don't hold it forever my brother so that is the way my brethren of fleeing from fornication sisters how do you flee when you receive a text message you don't know the background of that text message I encourage you not to answer that text message hey Pastor are you putting not putting us in prison are you saying that our phones we are going to be talking to only our father mother and sisters Pastor you are making it very hard how many agree with me now on what I just said I'm making it very hard yeah you not raising up your hand but that's what you are thinking in your heart but let me tell you H it does not mean that because you've been walking right with god um you are going to be we call it friends if that was to be the fact how come that we've had so many that have fallen into mistake and error that otherwise they would have missed but but they found themselves trapped you will trap yourself because you did not flee I have a sister I I really like her she's in in Kenya when a brother contacts her and he doesn't know about him uh he will ask her he will ask him who are you I'm so are you not the ones who are passing through the ventilators meaning he's saying if you are me I don't know you and my pastor should tell me about it before you contact me so who are you why are you contacting me what are you saying are you not the ones who are passing through the ventilators because the past the door to the ship is who the shepherd so sincerely I think that that sister is right if a brother wants to contact you in well if he wants to greet you normally to as a friend no problem that's why we have church more right so we can meet one another and GRE one another not sister are you agreeing with me we meet each other at church we greet why do you ask for my number so I can keep greeting you you will keep greeting me just keep coming to church you will find me at church right but you want my number so you can begin passing through the ventilators go through the door if you really want to to know me more go through the door as we shall see it quickly now let let me read a few more on this and then I conclude this one Ephesians chapter 5 the by there are so many scriptures about fornication you'll be surprised and so many pre so few preachers talk about against it and yet it is so much talked about in the New Testament you'll be so surprised uh Ephesians chapter 5 verse3 before we read that let us read Galatians 5:19 which says now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these number one adultery number two fornication number three uncleanness number four lasciviousness and others and he says we should avoid them and now in Ephesians 5:3 he says but fornication and all uncleanness or covetousness let it it be mentioned among you just a few times is that aen is that aen what did he say let it not be once once named among you as becometh Saints praise God neither fithness no foolish talking no jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks praise God now if some of you who say I can do it once in a while and then I Repent he says let it not be mentioned this one should not even be he did not say lies he said fornication Li is as bad right but here he's talking about fornication it should not be mentioned among in your life not even one time not even one time so to those of you who was a guilty of that it is not you are no longer guilty as we had this morning it is in your past you've got a new chapter with Jesus Christ and that is how you should keep it it shouldn't be mentioned in your life once whatever was done in your past is under the sea of forgetfulness and God remembers it no more and repentance if you repented it means you will no longer and never go back to it again all right now there is a scripture that I wanted to read before I leave this uh subject here um Can someone uh point me to that scripture is it this one which I was reading that says if a brother is a fornicator you should not even eat with him okay as you are finding it for us let us read first Thessalonians chapter 4 vers um vers three someone find me the other scripture for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and in honor where is Your Vessel where is Your Vessel Brethren you don't know Your Vessel your body your body is a vessel should be a vessel for honor and so you should know how to possess your vessel in sanctification and in honor not in the last of consu consience I don't know the pronunciation even as the Gentiles which know which he says even as the Gentiles which know not God because by that to the unbelievers this is a very small thing it's like we they even have words which they call a one night stand how many have heard such words you are so holy that you don't and have never heard that word they have them and because to them it's not a big deal you know it's a you know so but to us it should not be because our vessel should be a vels of horor now that word which I could not pronounce properly means strong sexual desire not in the last o of that even as the Gentiles which know not God because because that's how they are you see for them they live in lust they live in consience or strong sexual desire that no man go beyond and defoud his brother in any matter because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have for warned you and testified for God has not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness he there that despises despises not man but God who has also given unto us his Holy Spirit praise the Lord did you find that other scripture yes okay I think it 1 Corinthians chter 5:1 um so if you could not find it means you don't know these things so it is good that you are hearing them now okay let let me begin reading from verse 7 Purge out there the old Liv that ye may be a new lamp as ye are unleavened for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us therefore let us keep the feast not with the old living neither with the living of malice and wickedness but with the unli bread of sincerity and Truth I wrote unto you in an epistle not to company meaning not to associate are you hearing me church if you're hearing me say Amen if someone is a fornicator around you they will be shocked if you say Amen which means you are living that cohort you're going into another cohort so listen to me I wrote unto you in an epis not to company meaning not to associate with fornicators or sexual immoral people not to associate with fornicator can we say Amen to that now he says yet not all together with the fornicators of this world don't say oh your boss is a fornicator so you cannot associate with him you don't even want to take his instructions because he's a fornicator no he's saying not all together the fornicators of this world or the coers or the extortioners or with the idolators for then must ye needs to go out of the world but now I have written unto you not to keep Company If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator that also means if any woman be called a sister be a fornicator is the same thing it goes the same way don't say sisters we have we are not involved here you are involved as well you see if any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or cesious or an idolator or a raer or a drunkard an extortioner with such an one no not to eat meaning if a brother is a fornicator we already know what these things mean I I'm I'm not going to go into the explanations if a brother is a fornicator according to the scripture we are not even allowed to associate with them to eat even together with them in the same table did you know that if we cannot eat with them in the same table in our homes how much more in the church that means means they are not even allowed in the fellowship that means according to this scripture they are excommunicated you mean is that serious yes it is that serious if someone is called a brother or a Believer a Christian and yet is living immorally doing this doing that going with this one going with that one or not only that or a drunker a drun this guy who is drinking and then you know he gets drunk or he also has here whatever an extortioner an do you know who an extortioner is huh an ex is somebody who takes money by force or someone who steals people's money I think and they don't pay borrow me and they don't pay borrow me and they don't borrow me and they don't pay borrow me I will pay tomorrow and they don't pay borrow me brother they don't pay he goes to this brother he goes to that brother he goes to that let me tell you once you find such someone like that it should be brought and that person should be corrected if he can't correct himself he should be disassociated why I don't know God said so why because if he's not disassociated he will also make others like him yes it is that serious don't keep company with such people for what have I to do judge them also that are without why do I judge those ones who are not Believers or who are not among us but I judge them that are within those ones who are in the house of God they are my brothers they are my I will judge them I will judge them that's what Paul is saying but them but them that are without God will judge those ones who are not in the church God will judge but those ones who are in the church I should judge them therefore put away from among yourself that Wicked person hey that Wicked person that brother who is very busy I've seen those kind of behaviors those people who are like so which means it is serious for someone to be a drun for someone to be a raer for someone do you know who a raer is AA is a rev you know an idolator aous person someone someone who complains or protest strongly and persistently about something me even the way I'm seeing things in the church even this one even that one there are people like that who complain even the music I don't like the way sh plays the ways I don't like I don't even enjoy everything I don't know there's a problem in the church have you never seen people like that those AR rers we should not associate with them don't make them your friends disassociate yourself with such people why because they will also make you like them we should be positiv minded in the work of God we we should not be idolators or cous do you know a cous person a person who showing us a great desire to possess something belonging to someone else look at that I wish I'd get it it is not yours calm down down H you should you see oh I wish I was married look at that sister for example for sure sincerely you are cous someone tells you that this is the sister brother Andrew is going to marry and You Begin saying oh mama watch you cacious you see look for your sister look for your wife look for your own is Cal and people other people you you know that fornicators you also say fornicators now people like this according to the Bible the scripture has been very clear that we should not accompany with them we should take away such Wicked people from among our Mist now that is as far as not the very many scriptures I've not talked about but as far as this meeting is concerned that's as much as I can talk about fornication and I will tell you what God hates it you can see clearly through the scriptures God hates it but then again marriage the Bible says as I began is Honorable okay marriage is Honorable the feelings that God put in your body yes there's a deep calling there must be a deep to respond and um uh do not if you are overwhelmed don't don't be by yourself come and seek councel we'll give you councel we'll pray with you you see these things need God it need God doesn't need your mind or to talk with people because you're excited then you begin to you know some brothers some younger men when they overwhelmed by their body how many understand what I'm talking about brother Enoch Sur you understand surely everybody knows you a youth there is someone who wrote a paper and he said you know I'm a youth and then he was asking a question you see it is true you a youth and when your body overwhelms you others no to be able to calm down I need to find someone I can always be calling and calm down myself sincerely that's how you're going to do it brother Patrick that's not the right way huh Brother Sam huh brother Samuel am I communicating brother Enoch brother Ivan brother Joel yes even you brother Dixon you have a phone don't behave as if it is them h brother praise you also have a phone do you have a phone brother B you have a phone okay so do you also call some people to calm yourself down you find you see these younger people do that you know said now let me call some even sisters now I feel I need to have a brother so I can always be talking to him I'm not intending to marry them but just to calm myself down you know to relax and it's a wrong spirit it's a spirit of fornication knocking on your door that's not the way to do it if you want to calm yourself down come to the Lord Jesus come and pray this is what we used to do you go and pray of course you will and you fast and you get energy you'll be now on fire after some time again you'll go down until you overcome you understand don't give up don't give up don't give up on on Holiness don't give up on the word of God don't give up on your future because fornication is one number one killer of Christians do you know why Christians don't Prosper Christians don't Prosper because they are the most they are the biggest Hypocrites do you know why the people in the world like Muslims Prosper financially because they don't live in hypocrisy so Pastor should we be Muslims well they don't have the blessing of God upon their life the blessing of God maketh rich and he adds no sorrow upon it they have a lot of sorrow in all the prosperity they have attained or have accumulated but if you have the blessing of God it will make you rich both spiritually and physically but here is a Muslim he will as many as he wishes and afford even Catholics do by the way and anglicans and some Pentecostal these days are also doing it including pastors right but the Believers should not you see you find your one and you stay with that one you stick with that one some of us decided long time ago by the way it has to be a decision if you don't make a decision it won't happen some of you even fear to talk about marriage you have to make a decision now now before that time so that when you've made up your mind God will give you your desire according to your heart's desire you make up your mind I'm going to marry and I'm going to marry one wife and I will stick with her and I will love her and I will give her everything and I will just be everything I can to her same thing to you sister you say I'm not going to defile myself with anybody with anything until I get married and when I get married I must marry a child of God a Son of God now you see these are decisions you make really early in life if you don't consider this as a value you don't take it as a value you're going to meet a lot of people in the world that don't see it as a value so what are you going to do are you going to devalue your value to their value we have a value and the value we have is a word of God this is a tunnel it's a tunnel what are you going to replace it with with a gibberish that is in the world with the other things that do not have value on them I say thank God for the word because it puts value on everything that we do and I find that believers who are married properly have a lot of Peace have a lot of um you know when you talk to people especially people who've been married and have had issues in their marriage you really get a burden for the Young Generation you say what are they going if you make one wrong decision you have made many wrong right decisions and many wrong ones as well but this one when you make it in your life it will affect your life forever if you marry wrong wrongly or if you enter into fornications adulteries even after marriage if you enter into adultery it's the same thing and the spirit of lust is not cured by marriage how many can say Amen to that if you have a spirit of last don't think that when you marry the Bible says if you burn marry marriage does not cure burning rather last marriage does not do it what does cure it is the holy spirit that's why you should be filled with the Holy Spirit before you begin looking for a wife because if you look for a wife based on the lust that you have in your body you will pick the wrong one and when you pick the wrong one again she will ruin your life and then again you will continue you'll continue so you will now continue living in adultery remember he says War mongers fornicate us an adulterers God will judge even after marriage when you continue living as an adulterer still there is Judgment that comes to that but we as Believers we know that marriage is not a sin marriage is one of the best thing brother bam said it the second best thing to Salvation how many are saved here if you're saved H God should give you a wife as the next best gift now me I have my next best gift brother back there has his next best gifton has his next best gift right who else is married here yeah even brother also your phone your next best gift right or are you changing your mind now you have found now some of you have not found that second next best gift so you are not very rich until you find that next best gift at the right time in the right way in the right approach now I'm not going to go through quotes through what I'm just going to read you um uh give you this as a statement we go to the questions maybe there's a quote I wanted to read may God help me because I don't want to keep you long now um there is this um number one people have asked me often times what then how should we approach marriage what are the best what are the right what is the right procedure for marriage the right procedure for marriage of course it is based on the Eastern people because this Bible is based on the Eastern or oriental people the approach the way they married and we find that we are following that number one the thing that is is going to happen is courtship now in courtship under courtship a lot of things happen of course a decision is made under or when you approaching marriage when you want to do courtship for example you you have loved my daughter and um you want to marry her what do you do I want a very sharp brother to tell me what you do yes brother Dixon huh you got your okay now when we talk about decisions and courtship of course brother bam in some other quot he says that a man must first pray of course a husband or a wife comes from prayer that one I just wanted to underline that as the very first step you don't find wives in matchmaking some people are very good matchmakers hi do you know a Matchmaker you don't know you come I tell you what a Matchmaker is a Matchmaker a matchmaker is someone who who comes and tells you brother Billy you're ready for marriage you come out tell you son is that sister there don't you see her eyes what do you think you see what do you think and then you yeah there are listening listening listening and then eventually he said by the way way so then he he leaves you there then he goes to the other sister when he comes to the sister he will tell her sister what do you think the other brother is of mine he has said that blah blah blah blah blah blah blah what do you think and then after he has talked to this one he has talked to this one then he he he he watches them while encouraging them and then eventually that they should marry one another God Bless you that's matchmaking now marriage is not made by matchmaking marriage it is God to do the match making there must be a matchmaking God matching the two people but it is God who matches them not a man right and it is done through prayer through prayer you don't pray after you have found your March you pray before there are chances that if you pray after what are you praying for you are going to make the wrong decision because you praying under the influence of the last of your heart or flesh or whatever it is there are chances that whatever advice and canel you will be given you will never accept it because you have already made up your mind but if you pray before you approach if you pray pray before you see anybody even before you see you have been you have been praying so how many here are planning on getting married in the next 2 years raise up your hand sisters and brothers don't don't fear don't fear okay okay I say about five how many are planning on getting married in the next 5 years from now next 5 years by the way do you know why I'm asking you I I want to see do you know what I'm talking about because you see this thing it doesn't happen by mistake like fornication doesn't happen by mistake marriage doesn't also happen by mistake that e you have fallen in marriage by mistake no you pray you plan you believe if you want a house it's not going to come to you by mistake God has given you a house by mistake no you believe for it you plan for it you even you even draw write down your vision I want it like this I want like this I was giving my testimony to a group of young people in Ethiopia and one of them ephra he C it he said ah you matter at what age 21 I said hm I'm also going to M by 21 and he did it he did it and he had nothing no zero amount of money hey what are you talking about so it is Vision if you don't have Vision so if I must raise up your hand and you're like how will they see me me who has nothing you don't have Vision you should have vision and plan how many are going to marry in 5 years planning from now by 5 years in 5 years you'll be married raise up your hand uhuh now I don't to want to ask the others because I thought that people who were 20 something here by Fe five years you should be married so those of you are planning 10 years I think I don't know whether you have Vision or not I will not talk about that but here is what I want to say to those of you who have raised up your hand now it is the time to pray now before you find anybody before you see anybody before you dream of anybody right because it is God who should give you a wife or a husband hband it begins with prayer Amen on both ends on on the end of the woman and on the end of the man number two after prayer then you will see somebody okay I always give this illustration usually I give that illustration that um this is how it was when God created Adam come on I demonstrate this on you brother Adam was alone just like this man is alone but in Adam was the woman was it on the left on the right Adam was not shaking like that when God touched his side okay on on I not touch you don't worry so so Adam Adam had his wife in her in him rather and uh when God wanted to take the wife of Adam out what did God do he made Adam to sleep and I told you you see that's where it is you begin finding a wife by prayer he was sleeping meaning you were closing your eyes in prayer waiting upon God Adam was waiting upon God the whole time when he was sleeping the whole time when he was closing his eyes that's how you do you are waiting upon God In Prayer number two what happened what happened in prayer what happened when he was closing his eyes God was your wife is in you now this is very important uh this is our evening don't rush me please when you are looking for a wife many times that wife does not actually exist the one in your dreams did you know that the wife of your dreams does not exist anywhere Al explain you you you say I want a girl that is like this okay I can give you you want to speak those things okay tell us tell us speak through the microphone notor sure no I'm sure okay tell us a doctor with similarity in my name right in your name okay yes and a Believer Andie number even if she looks like a monkey of course she's beautiful what is to you okay [Laughter] she's so I don't know what what is be to him to him Bey may be figure eight but to some of you be may be I don't know someone would say I want a woman look a woman who has long hair up to the back she must be a Ugandan she must have eyes blue eyes she must have teeth which is divided properly she must um uh you know have a body that is very very calmly looking nice American height and nails that are very beautiful and ears that are not very wide or very whatever and cheeks that are you know a nose which is pointed like whatever and but sincerely speaking where are you going to get that kind of woman from you understand that woman is in your dream is in your mind but where will she come from God but who does that you get the point that woman is in your mind you don't know when God when God leads you to someone you say no God knows what you want is that but it is a work in progress he's going to perfect her now when I see my wife my wife can you please come is it possible for you to come here darling praise God hallelujah amen I've been happy with her ever since praise God isn't it a wonderful [Laughter] match but let me tell you something thank you for coming I did not expect okay now you see this girl she's still a girl know we have five children some of you can't believe she's a girl is she not don't don't feel bad so you see five good children and we still having more if the Lord desires and teres sister don't be shocked yes and we are growing younger but let me tell you by the time I saw her listen she was how many have ever seen one of our pictures when we are younger some of you have seen she was Tiny and I was also tiny not only her and we were you know while time went on and while we were together living together together she's learning me I am learning her she's slowly by slowly coming into the full image of me you understand it did not happen in one day I love you dear thank you so so so so it's good to be married Brethren it is sweet it is nice and uh the whole time she was in me my mind when I saw I said but she is not exactly what I wanted God even her hair you have seen her hair now but if you see her hair then sincerely it was it was very horrible it's the truth even as she will tell you by by herself you know but when I was seeing it is not exactly what I what I wanted but but but God said is she's the one I wasn't sure even I had I had already told my pastor I was already talking with her but when I became unsure like this I told her I'm sorry let me first pray and be sure so I went I packed my bags I went I was I was desperate I prayed I said oh God prove to me oh God speak to me let me know your mind let me know your will but I had prayed before I found her but now that I was not sure even after finding I wanted to just be sure that it was the choice of God for me brother be sure that what God is saying don't marry someone when you are not sure you regret marry when you are sure and when I became sure God spoke to me in various ways I don't want to spend time on that but he spoke to me I came out very confident oh I had already broken her heart because I told her wait let me first confirm with God by the time I came back she was not on fire as she was on at first but SL by SL me I was sure so I I proposed to her and she looked on the roof she looked everywhere she looked on the right and the left but finally she had she could not run away from that word because she was meant for me and she accepted me and today I'm here very happy after 10 years I can't believe you 10 years brother Ian time runs like like nothing like wind and so you see friends your wife is in you God saw the end from the beginning and he knows what you want and he will lead you to the right one and when God leads you to the right one then it's time to come now to the pastor when you see of course you've seen them asking this and that sometimes it is not even very effective what is so effective is for God to confirm to you things and the testimony you hear from others I'll tell you that I'm telling you now real things and after you've make it is called due diligence do you know what due diligence is after you've made all your research and prayer after you've contacted you've done your due diligence then now you come to the pastor don't come to me when you are just is she the one is she not is she the one is she not it's not also good come to me only when you are 100% or at least 90% sure then when you come to me I will ask you are you sure she's the one if you say you are not I'll tell you okay go and confirm how are you going to confirm continue wrestling it in prayer and when you are sure that she's the one come back to me I'll tell you what next H now if I tell you like that and then you you go Pastor is just delaying me why must sister give me your contact you have already broken the whole thing you don't have the blessing of God you are on your own the moment you do that and God can't bless such a union I'm telling you I've seen it over and over and over and so um so you then courtship begins after your pastor is aware after the father of the girl is aware after if she's a most especially if they're Believers you know then you have approvals to court now I told you here before when I was preaching that believers do not de Believers CAU how many understand that H very few even the ones who understand it cannot understand it properly they putting their hand down like Believers what's the difference between cting and dating it's almost the same right but the difference here is dating is worldly whereby you you get a girl you see you say this is my girlfriend friend you you going everywhere together you are kissing you are hugging you are visiting each other you are sleeping together you are doing this and that do you understand what I'm talking about but we are only making sure that you don't become pregnant now that is dating and Believers don't date like that someone I saw a question here I'll answer it right here say that why is it that Believers in the West can do that and yet we cannot Believers in the west don't do that if you know anyone who do does it come and tell us no one do it among the Believers no one does it Believers caught and you CAU with the permission of the parents and especially your pastor should be aware and uh after that you know you've courted you've got to know one another you've agreed with one another agreements have been made decisions have made been made between the two then comes the next um Step then comes the engagement now engagement happens at the altar you've seen that happen before here engagement happens at the altar that's when you've now been sure the parents are sure you are sure the girl is sure the boy is sure the pastor is sure everybody is in unity together then now you do the engagement now what is the engagement who knows the engagement engagement in our culture but because usually we do it almost at the wedding time we aftera and you've known what you are going to uh the requirements of the parents and you have agreed with them to have your their daughter then you can give her an engagement ring as a sign you are mine and I'm Yours after the engagement you can't make up your mind to choose another you can't make up your mind to choose another it is done it is done then now you have to plan for your marriage ceremony and lastly you plan for your hmon but the problem usually is at the beginning there if you begin wrong I've seen many couples when you begin wrong you will always end wrong please I emphasize this when you begin wrong you will always end wrong and what is beginning wrong sorry my brother beginning wrong is the things that I've underlined and told you about beginning wrong is when you begin asking for contacts and I'm telling you here as your pastor if you take me to be a man of God we do not believe in exchanging numbers of people who are not married one with another and they begin talking without the knowledge of their pastors and their parents it is wrong it is wrong it is wrong and if you have understood it say Amen if a brother asks you your number sister and you give it you are also wrong and whatever ever happens don't say because I've heard rumors I'm telling you this on good authority I've heard rumors oh Brothers at dvf they they they they begin talking to sisters and then they withdraw they begin talking to sisters and then they disappoint them they begin talk they do this who has been guilty of that if you have been guilty of that you ought to repent you ought ask God to forgive you as a matter of fact when when when before before a a relationship reaches engagement before a relationship reaches engagement you you should it should even be secret it's a secret affair it should not even be known by many people really maybe the pastors and the parents and then your closest friend maybe you know not to be moved everywhere that thing is not right it shouldn't be done that way you know we've often seen people I was myself I was standing outside there and we've had many younger ladies visit this fellowship and then I was standing there I remember one day I never told anybody but it was like a dagger in my heart and then I saw young men running after this sister you know I don't know what they were telling the sister but I believe and I suspect they were saying sister sister sister sister sister to the extent that the girl will fear to come back again and when they leave like that they will go tell others it's a wrong spirit it's a wrong testimony it should never be heard Among Us never it's a wrong Spirit you should treat these sisters with dignity they daughters of God and you should also treat yourself honorable as a man of God friends if you want to marry the right place to go to is your pastor if you see someone go to your pastor now sisters let me talk to you a moment if someone comes and asks your number don't give it and if you've given some to some of those younger men you have a choice to make now are you going to continue in that relationship is it legal is it right is it holy is it accept what what are you trying to do what are you trying to talk about what are you building is it known or it is just something happening in the corridors if I were you I would begin again and say wait a moment what am I trying to do here and then if they say that the person NOS come and confirm or else there may be some of those wolves in ship's clothing lying to you to try and trap you don't be trapped don't accept anyone to trap you to their game be a real honorable person and God will bless you they are saying that it is difficult is to find a wife or a husband it is a lie of the devil it is easy as easy as it was 2,000 years ago because God is the same Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and forever if you follow the right principles as we teach them to you then it will not be difficult to you and if you want to confirm some of the things I've been saying please read the message the marriage of the lamb every one of you young people go and listen to it you have smartphones download it listen to all of it all of it brother bam says a very very good things in there the marriage of the Lamb 1962 praise the Lord now if you have any question out of what I said and you had not asked it feel free to ask and then I'll I'll now deal with these questions Pastor help me to understand what happens to sisters who give birth early will they two get Brothers on or it's difficult and let me ask a young men who are here how many would like to marry a sister that has children raise up your hand nobody rose up their hand so I'll tell you it is difficult so if you're planning to get a child it's difficult now if you already have one and you were not previously in any marriage that means you are not in any marriage it just happened and then you know you you got a child um but you not legally bound to any man for marriage it it is possible for you to marry it is legal scripturally legal for you to marry um a child is not necessarily a testimony of marriage it can happen when there is no confident of marriage I have also seen Grown sisters who are C I do not understand what she means by um I have seen Grown sisters who are is it corporate or trying to I don't know Finding difficulty to get married or maybe she meant I have also seen Grown sisters who are corporate finding difficulty to get married advise on this subject I I think when you mean sisters who are corporate you mean somebody who has a career someone who has a a good job or um I do not think it is difficult if you follow the due principles as we have presented them to you it's never difficult for both the sister and the brother I've given you many times an example of a brother morgas in Ethiopia who is now the pastor of the local church in Adis Ababa it wasn't difficult for him to find a wife um it was it's a long story but um when he saw this sister the sister was working in a a very big Bank earning a lot of money in dollars H she had property she was quite doing well financially speaking and she was corporate like you just asked the question and uh when this young man who was just newly from college uh came and you know saw how he he had always given a a testament or a testimony that U my wife is somewhere she's worshiping God one day I'll turn my eyes and I will see her you remember that testimony so she turned her he turned his eyes one day in the church and he saw her and he came to me he said she's my wife I said are you sure he said yes I'm sure I said are you really sure I said I gave him some of you have given you that booklet of 100 pages I told him on courtship and marriage I said go read it when you have finished reading it come back to me if you're still sure he said I'm still sure after a few maybe two weeks I said well then pray a little more they contacting a sister I made it very difficult for him because I knew the sister he is trying to contact is Corporate and if you is not really sure and the say refuses it will demoralize him and he was my associate I did not want a demoralized associate I needed someone who is going to be St so I didn't want to allow him to go you see pastors have many different reasons so when he he guides you don't I'll just do the way please it means you have a problem of listening and submitting submit to leadership and so he did and he did not contact her until you know he kept on coming he said pastor I'm now sure I prayed and I'm sure I said well then if you sure my wife I think gave him the contact and uh then uh you know started talking to the sister and uh the sister God had already spoken to her the time when he was praying the time when he was praying God spoke to the sister but God had already spoken to the sister and God had already showed the brother what type of woman he will marry and God had already showed the sister before they even came in contact so you can see this whole thing is done by God Brethren matchmaking is done by God it's not about how much money you have or how little you have God can give you anybody the brother had nothing the sister had everything but guess what I I fed to nirobi met the pastor and we talked over read the pastor welcomed us and then we were able to um you know uh uh you know also speak to the family and and the and the girl when she came down to um Ethiopia before we even knew she was going to marry the brother my wife and I told her we claim you here she said amen h nothing happens by accident brother sister we claimed that in Ethiopia and God did it through marriage and a brother married her well long story short they got married in Nairobi it was a powerful wedding powerful wedding and um and uh how even God did it all to leave her job and to go everything was a testimony it's a long story I don't want to waste time on that maybe one time they will give they will come and give their own testimony uh it will encourage many young people so yes it is possible for someone who cooporate to marry uh very very well if they followed the right principles of the word the whole time the sister was single but waiting upon God she had the money to get a younger brother and you know convince him with money and support and stuff like that and make him close so that eventually the young man can pick interest but she did not you see so because when a sisters corporate there is also that temptation but you need to know your place that God bless you uh the saints of God I'm asking now I'm asking now women are not allowed to preach on the pulpit am I allowed to preach at the roadside or door to door or to a group of people sitting down together you are not allowed to preach on the pulpit it's it's not about the pulpit it's about the principle of preaching whereby there are two things as long as you do not go against them it's okay number one you're not allowed to rule over men rule over men number two you're not allowed to teach men all right teach men instruct them meaning instruct them so if you're preaching or you're sharing your testimony is not including that then I think that should be fine and I don't see you preaching on the rad side and not ruling over whoever you are preaching to I I I don't think that preaching is really for men for women but I believe that you can exhort uh people even men you can lead them to the Lord we have many testimonies in the Bible of women that led many men to the Lord and so it is possible without necessarily teaching them maybe giving them a track and telling them about what you believe like giving a testimony and bringing them to church that's the best way a sister can preach and another way living a life that is worthy of your testimony all right uh another question God bless you there is this guy who has admired my ways as a sister I don't know if this guy is a Believer because Believers he should have said a brother I don't know but he said a guy there is this guy who has admired my ways as a sister because at my uh because of my Christian ways and and he said I can only say yes to him if he comes to church because he is more than willing to come to church I am afraid he might come get saved and later propose to me is it even appropriate should I just chase him away because because I don't want to do PCM very good question now you're mixing up two things sister I think this is a sister you're mixing up two things number one you are mixing up salvation of a soul and marriage that one should never be found in one statement or one sentence it is the biggest mistake you can ever do I want to believe that this guy as you said has talked to you and talked about marriage with you which was the a mistake to begin with because from what you are saying it appears you have already told her for us I can't marry you unless you believe what I believe and now when you do that he will say it's all right I I'll will come to your church I I will accept you already know these things but you're asking as if you do not know so now if you make that deal it's a deal you have planned your marriage and your marriage has not come from God and you you are more likely to find issu ues but here is what I would do if I was you I would encourage that man or that guy as you said to come to church and leave him in the hands of the ministers you would have done your part forget about him you have no relationship with him don't accept him to get into your private inbox that means WhatsApp and stuff calls that's completely out consider him a soul that you have won to the Lord if indeed he comes and he scks in the church but if he's a seed of God he will indeed believe and he can truly be changed and your and your pastor if you come to church here I'll give you an opinion of him after a little while indeed we are able to know that but um if he not and intending to catch you and then snatch you away or leave the Lord we can also find out if he's meant for you he will be for you no need to worry right now what you should should be worried about is winning a soul to the Lord don't even think about marriage because you can't think about marriage with an nonbeliever have I answered that appropriately it is possible for you to lead someone to the Lord who will be your husband or wife by the way it is not that we are saying it is impossible it is very much possible but that person has to be genuine you see who knows that they are genuine ah don't tell me that spiritual men cannot design between a sheep and a God we can be able to see that and that's why a pastor is placed there for such things like that another question how do you know your future partner I've already answered that have I not have I not church if I haven't said no then I will answer it have I not if I have say Amen all right did someone said no I think I've answered that it's what we spent more of the time on God bless you Pastor is it right for a youth to have a girl uh this one is be the way he's asking he doesn't want me to know whether is a boy or a girl but uh by the handwriting I can think he's a boy is it right for a youth to have a girl or boyfriend I think I've also answered this but I will emphasize on this when you say a girlfriend or boyfriend in the world that means someone you can do private things together is that correct yes what are the private things hugging and kissing and spending time together right private time together that is almost like someone who is in your courtship or in courtship with you so that is out of bounds for believers we do not do such things that's dating and Believers don't date so I don't expect you to have a girlfriend he's my girlfriend he my boyfriend no no no no we don't do that if you do yes everybody has friends that are not the same gender even myself that you see that shouldn't even be a question it is human to have friends not of the same gender is it not human that's why I don't believe in these things of of single schools I think it's not good because it makes boys not express themselves properly and girls not express themselves properly I think it's good for them to go in a mixed school um but um whereby it becomes a question it means it is meaning something else you get the point so because if he a friend who is a girl I think limitation you know you must have something that connects you with anybody that you are friends with not so whether it's a boy or a girl you must have a connection so the question is what is your connection books ah no problem if it is a books it is no problem for example I'll give you an example here sham stand up stand up favor stand up here are two young people that go to the same school favor was ministered to by sham I've never heard that do you have a relationship going on are you planning to get married you get point I don't know of any relationship going on between them it is purely books and even when I go to school I will find them is studying together at school in public no Private Affairs you get a point others do it at school hey wait a moment I may be telling lies sister are you at the same school what I said is it true or there is something else there's nothing H go God has done some you get the point so it is possible to have a friend when there is no alterior motives but if you decide later on to marry your friend who is a Believer what is wrong with that but now when you make a friend who is not a Believer then there's a problem there a problem to have a friend who is not a Believer because what if you like them and then eventually you want to marry them I used to have a friend oh that girl was called Jen she was were we were having is there a journey here we were having normal friendship nothing attached but eventually I developed feelings and I thought I would marry her and I had already believed now about one or two years so I told my pastor is it possible to Mar an unbeliever he said no I felt so bad because we had received an attachment so you see you should be careful about those thingsa you a human being and you have feelings right okay um don't worry my wife knows about Jane she will not crucify me that is why it is good to tell them these things before you get married because after after they hear it you if she was hearing it for the first time I would have had a tough time at home today all right another question here is it right for a Believer girl and boy to be so close to one another no it is not under no circumstance should you be so close because so close means danger you cannot put fire and and and what is this butter together my dear you will cause problems butter and fire can coexist but not so close uhhuh another question since gifts like seeing visions prophesying are without repentance should we call um like some of the nonb leave us with these gifts to prophesy and see Visions for us for us I am the one who added that but I think she meant for us no I I believe like you said gifts and callings are without repentance a man can have a gift but he himself go to hell did you know that but also the Bible says that uh when the blind the blind lead the blind both of them fall into the ditch if I were you I would desire to have a real born again man of God to minister to me and if he had no gift at all I would just still trust in the word of inspiration that God will give him for my life I would not rely and direct and Lead my life on the basis of gifts and Visions because many times those things could be of God but also could be from the devil and another thing is these people when they are not born again it means they have no fear of God they can add anything I've seen people who are even drunkards but with these gifts yes it is true possible so don't trust those things because it can be wrong and sometimes it can be right and sometimes it could be right and then they add other things on top of it so you want to trust a real uh Ministry that will mature your life not gifts you want to trust gifts that are coming in the right channel of God uh are there no gifts in the house of God that's why we should desire for the things of God if there are gifts among us then uh uh God can speak through us and I believe in this church we have gifts we have people who see Visions we have people who dream dreams we have people who tell prophecies we have people who speak tongues we have people who interpret tongues so we are not La in lack of gifts and I don't see the relevance of this question and if you feel that um there are these people who go around selling gifts I saw them in Ethiopia you know a they pray with you they prophesy prophesy prophesy prophesy and then and then they some something and then you'll give them are they here in Uganda e you prophesy prophesy prophesy speak to you and the things will always be positive by the way and then after you'll give money it is a they call it what of prophet whatever but those things we should not be found in such um in such traps because it can easily mislead you all right why do I feel that God does doesn't answer my prayers uh you feel that God is not answering your prayers you should you might have a reason why you feel that way maybe because your prayers are not coming to pass I'll direct you to the scripture which says that um your prayers are not answered because maybe you pray a Miss how do you pray a miss you do not pray according to the will of God it's just like a married man praying God may you give me a wife God will not answer that prayer prayer but because you're praying am Miss but also you may pray wrongly you may not pray correctly what is praying correctly you must pray according to the heart of God according to the desire and the will of God and the will of God is found in the word of God the word is the basis for prayer if you do not know the word you cannot pray according to the will of God but if you know the will of God you know the word of God then you're going to pray according to the inspiration that you have received from the word of God and God will always answer such prayers I have the example of Daniel when Daniel read the book of the prophet and he found the will of God for Israel then he went to prayer and when he went to prayer God came by an Angel and spoke to him and guided him how he should pray so God should guide you how to pray and your prayers will always be answered okay can one have the Holy Ghost and be not sure no if you have the Holy Spirit you will be sure if you're not sure it's a clear sign either you are not well Tau or you do not have the Holy Spirit because another way of answering this question is uh how many he have ever had a child get the microphone pass it to Sister MAA I want to ask a question uh make sure it is on uh sister MAA how many children do you have Pastor I have four children four children um is it possible for you to have them and not no no it's not possible uh what about you know that you have them that they are yours but how sure uh uh is it possible for you that you delivered them by yourself and they were not given to you by adoption but you delivered them and then you forgot that you delivered is it possible it's not possible why because I know them and I was giving birth to them and they have grown in my hands and the labor word were you in the labor word yes I was in the lab of you remember how each child treated you yes sir you had an experience with each child yes God bless you so you see when you are having the Holy Ghost it's like child birth it's New Birth it's like child bir you will remember when you received him you remember how you remember what experience you had and you remember what happened to you afterwards so you see it is an experience I've Tau on this before but I can take it further in other teachings in the church if you you you will whoever ask this question if you're not satisfied come to me and then I can be able to guide you further okay another question here can someone okay on this question some people say brother bam say that you receive the Holy Spirit without sensation how many have read that quote uhuh so now it means that when the Holy Spirit comes he comes in quietly and you will never know I'll tell you this the holy spirit is not emotion but the holy spirit is emotional do you understand that okay a child is not emotion but a child will never be deceived without emotion when a child during child birth and labor there will be all sorts of things it will be a mess blood everywhere water this and that and some other stuff I don't want to talk about it will be a mess sometimes but then out of that comes the child himself you see some some people can even have all that mess and still they they deliver a stillborn child and the child will be dead they will come out with all the mess but without a child so it's a blessing when you go there you got the mess you get the mess and then you get your child but now people who are teaching us that we should not have a mess that one is not even in the script why because as much as whether your child is dead or not the mess will be there if indeed you were pregnant now when you receive the word of God it will impregnant your soul impregnant your soul you will stay under the altar revelation after Revelation striking your heart what what will happen after you will receive receive an experience there will be a mess sometime you know we've seen it here sometimes people you know shouting and falling down and you know having all sorts of tears and shouting and everything which they did not plan to do which they were not faking it was real now does it mean they have received the Holy Spirit sometimes yes sometimes no because it may be a mess but when they've just been anointed on their Spirit you know when you're not anointed on your spirit you can even speak in tongues and rejoice and Shout but how do we know you have received this Holy Spirit the life afterwards the fruit area if the that area of the fruit is missing then that means you don't have the Holy Spirit but when the fruit to those of you who want to know the fruit area put for them the scripture in the book of Galatians the fruit of the spirits are Joy love peace other things so when you see those things in your life after the experience not before after the experience then you will know indeed you have the Holy Spirit things that you did not used to do you now do them things you used not you used to do you no longer do them is the life of Jesus Christ in you but you cannot receive it quietly it comes in with emotion but itself it is quiet it is God who comes on your heart he comes in slowly and he comes in without a f he's gentle butam said the holy spirit is a gentleman you see he comes in so slowly just like that child when that child is born after all the hustle and the mess then he's born silently but then afterwards what happens what happens crying comes out if the child doesn't cry that child is still born is dead and there are many believers who are still born no experience at all not crying at all I don't like such a church I'm so thankful that our church is not so cold like that we must be on fire where you are here hearing hallelujah amen shouting here clapping hands here jumping here running around here no problem we want those things but some Churches when people do like that you will be what's happening when you hear some someone say hallelujah what is happening you see because you are not used to that Dynamics but you see when if you want to see there is life in the church there will be those Dynamics it will be in the church to show you that there is life the child will cry out and if they doesn't if he doesn't cries out sometimes they have to beat him a bit so that's why brother bam says that the church sometimes needs a gospel spanking you spun them with the gospel and it bring that cry out Hallelujah all right I think I've answered that one now can someone who has backer SLE be baptized again like someone who has been doing ungodly things like having boyfriends boy lovers like at school dancing daners ah this one is very tough ah what can that person do in order for him to for him or her live a perfect Godly life very good question I take this question with all seriousness and I understand that it means much to you but um to begin with uh I've talked about the matter of boyfriends I've talked about boy lovers now this matter of boy lovers and boyfriends I don't know if there is a difference but I hope you mean that the boyfriends and the boy lovers both fall in the same category otherwise you would not have mentioned boyfriends but now you are trying to say that you have boyfriends after that then you have boy lovers so you have them in phases and then you you go at danz danz I think you mean uh you mean dances at school in in Disco by the way those discos they arrange at school Believers should not be a part of them they used to make them but I never attended them one time I went to one and when I went and I arrived there like this I was going to enter and something came and hit me it was the Sten of all the people who are dancing I felt like vomiting I ran out I never went even close when they dancing I go very far in the dmetry there so let me tell you I don't know people who go to those dances how they are able to bear that Sten I really don't know I don't know I don't know you do you know so younger people don't go to those kind of dances it has wrong spirits that it puts in your spirit and then you you you you you begin to become starchy to the word of God and you know you you begin to feel cold and you no longer desire the things of God you know because it so you don't want to be close to those kind of things um so the question is do you need to be baptized again you don't you don't need to be baptized again if you are baptized already in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ because once Jesus G gives you salvation he gives it to you once and for all he doesn't take it away and if you receive the spirit of God still he doesn't take him him away but what happens is the joy of your salvation will go David uh uh speaks of that in the book of uh Psalms chapter 51 he says when he had sinned he had gone with a woman who was not has and killed a husband and uh he had committed murder and adultery and he wanted God to forgive him he prayed like this he said uh he said U create in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within me and he says take not away your Holy Spirit from me meaning he still had the Holy Spirit when the Holy Spirit comes just like salvation he abides he doesn't ever go but the joy of Salvation will go so you need to restore that relationship with Jesus Christ in prayer in consecration in fasting and God will give it back to you all right uh we are advancing we advancing don't you worry are we tired okay we can push on can a Believer wear clothes having labels like de is that what is this did I pronounce that properly di Drew and many others di is it called di di Dior ah pronounce is pronunciations are different uh Drew let me ask you what does Dio mean huh H what does do mean yes it means that devil is our ruler devil is our [Music] ruler yes yeah I I agree with you but every brand has a meaning for example for example Toyota is a brand it is someone whose name that's behind Toyota we know is a person and that's why they call it Toyota and there are other brands that uh also having a meaning behind it either openly or secretly so now Dio is it someone's name or does it mean exactly what the sister said and is secret so most people concer here that it means devil is our Ruler all right and then uh Drew means what huh devil rules everywhere the young people are killing me today what what what are you saying brother it's their brands that is BAS such it means what huh I can't even understand those things uh here is what I want to say on this matter uh and pro probably someone who has asked this question it's a question in their minds maybe because of what we have heard here it is it may be true or it may be false that they have a bad meaning like we're hearing people may come up with the this words and they may be actually right or they may be wrong but the fact is uh the Bible says stay away or Shine from every appearance of evil it may not be evil but if it appears as evil stay away from it don't be anywhere close to it stay away from it um if it's a brand and and also receive the Holy Spirit if you have the Holy Spirit you know you see these people they now making everything for example even socks the other day I was you know somewhere and I I saw a man wearing a socks with a rainbow and someone told me um uh that you see that socks means that that that person is a homosexual I said what how do you know that I was about to tell you it's beautiful I would want to buy it so in other words you see but uh people know a lot of things that are secret or they are open or they are not known but when when you have the Holy Spirit he will lead you he will guide you to all truth and and in some of these things you may want to buy a dress but something in you tells you m leave that one or a shirt or a T-shirt and you just leave it you don't know even why always follow that leading of the spirit of God and if something has a question about it stay away from stay far from it okay what can a Believer do in order for him or her to live a Pure Life without listening to secular music though he or she is leaving where people listen to it the Bible says we are in the world but we are not of the world if you in a place maybe your neighbors are playing worldly music and uh you have power to tell them to reduce or stop you can do that but if I were you you a younger person I am sure if you don't want it you know how to for example you can get earphones that will blind or block your ears from hearing what others are hearing and you will hear something else is that not true you can devise means of keeping yourself s spiritually s in an insane situation I believe that that is what you would do otherwise you don't want to say don't do that you see and then you begin also dancing when I go to I will repent after all everybody is now you know my family what am I going to to to distance myself from my family let us dance and then when I go at church I will repent that is hypocrisy try to live your Christian life no matter where you are in whichever situation what can what can of friends can a Believer I think beli what kind of friends can a Believer have I think that's the question can someone answer this question what kind of believer can I what kind of friends can a believer have any young person there's a reason why I wanted to be answered this way who has an answer to this one raise up your hand so I can give you the microphone yes give it to the sister over there what kind of friends can I believe I have productive friends who who wait wait explain more who are productive friends both spiritually and physically God bless you friends that are helping you to progress in both spiritual things and physical life now you are going to have a friend who is going to tell you to try cigarettes or you going to have a friend who will tell you to do something that is against the word of God and you are saying after all is my friend some friends you have to disassociate yourself from them to cut that friendship to to to remove yourself from them or else when some certain things happen you don't say God will understand when you are the one who has caused them so make yourself friends of people who are going to add value on your life can you say Amen to that amen friends that will add value I think I was reading a quote here not long ago and brother bham said that um uh how many remember that uh he said something on the line of um I think associate yourself with people who believe who are believing like you are believing for example if you're believing to be a rich man don't associate yourself with poor people you will be poor I'm telling you because poor people talk poor things every time they are crying on how poor they are how bad the situation is how bad you know this happen so you will find yourself in the same talk that's why me when people talk like that I either keep quiet or move away because I don't want to be defiled you understand when people begin to talk about things that lift up Satan you know you see some people make the gospel hard they do this and uhuh I stay away from such people so it's right for you to associate yourself with people who are helping you to move in the right direction in your life can you say Amen to that am all right we have another question here why do white people why do white Believers de when they are still young yet is not okay to do it here I think this is the question I was meaning um I hope you meant courting to marry I hope you did not mean dating because no believer dats or I mean no believer goes in the way of the world of dating all believers caught in order for them to get into a marriage Union whether they are white or old but I think you're meaning why do white believers M young is that the question uh and yet we don't do it here I don't think that we don't do it here it's you who doesn't want to do it here H Brother Sam how old are you do you mind telling us your age 23 you are not married who refused you to get married is there anyone who refused you you see it is your choice me I'm 32 now at 21 I at 19 I decided to get married I'm in Uganda so don't say we don't do it here we do it here that is if you have purpose and a vision and you desire it you plan for it you pray for it you believe for it and you pursue it and you'll attain it so and I as your pastor will encourage you I don't want to encourage L people who don't want to work who don't want to go to school who are good for nothing and they they are saying they're going to get married how will you take care of someone's daughter but I should also say it is a bit difficult in Africa because uh of our livelihood and means of income and jobs and lack of them and but with the children of God we live in another economy if you are you desired something God will not remove it away from you he will give it to you if you desire it with all your heart so you see if you desire it God will grant it to you and he gave an example here for example going out with each other having meals together and more I think he's trying to say in some circles there is restrictions oh when you are you are you are courting you can't go out for a meal together you can't uhuh brother come here you are in courtship come and help us to understand this H yes you have finished courtship you are still in courtship you are the climax of it you you have now engaged have you ever taken her for a meal or for something nice or ice cream or just something nice have you ever had that moment with yes Pastor have you heard that so what who told you we don't do it here I don't know which Doctrine you are hearing from God bless you but as far as we are concerned here we do it we do it but ours should be in the light okay amen yeah so that one is answered okay can someone with the Holy Ghost watch a football match when he enjoys football Hallelujah I want to I I I want to uh to believe either you you don't have the Holy Ghost or you have the Holy Ghost one of the two but um let me say if you have the Holy Ghost he will lead you into all truth okay I've met brothers who say it's not wrong to watch football but it is wrong to watch movies and um I've met others I I asked the question why and I was told because movies are from Hollywood and brother bam condemned Hollywood but he never condemned football okay so then uh why is it wrong then to watch movies when it is acted by non-believers and then it is right to watch football that is acted by nonbelievers and they almost these days do the same thing you know things like it is in movies is it correct some of them even weird and even worse in football because there is a spirit behind every one of these activities and we don't want to be as saying that football is a scene I'm not one of those people that preach that football is a sin or watching videos is a sin I don't believe that either I believe that whatever we watch uh whether for entertainment or for nourishment or for relaxing or for free time should be uh not against our Christian principles if it is stay away from it if it is not then the holy spirit will lead you on one by one what you should do and not do myself I don't know about enjoying football I've never enjoyed football so I don't know really I can't talk about that I don't know I don't understand I've never enjoyed football so if someone enjoys football maybe they would want to answer that question anybody here who enjoys football come come and answer come and answer huh you enjoy playing you enjoy watching you enjoy watching come and tell us about that enjoyment I've never understood it come huh the brother is not ready to stand for his words so but as far as I'm concerned I I will say this on this statement what I can understand that uh when you are a Christian and you come to the Lord you will have a lot of things that you will be interested in before you come to the Lord a lot of desires you will have for instance others will love will have a as a passion to go for table tennis others football others volleyball others a lot of things of recreation like pool chess cards um there many many things you know watching Hollywood movies and things like that but when you come to Jesus Christ Slowly by slowly he begins that's why they call it h brainwashing because he begins to tune and F tune your mind and desires to something else there's a brother spoke to in um from the US a young man they were visiting here and and he told me he was a great lover of football great lover well of course not knowing knowing that football in itself is not a scene and there is no problem with watching football or playing football and so he was a great love of football and then you see he he realized that thing was getting a hold of him you know whenever the you know they scoring a goal ah he's getting crazy they banging the wall hes you know and then he was listening to the sermon of brother bham one time and he he had brother bam say if the thing is getting a hold of you get rid of it and then the Holy Spirit spoke to him isn't this getting really a hold of you and he from that moment he began distancing himself from it now it was an experience he had with the Holy Spirit and I believe whoever asked this question to begin with you need to receive the Holy Spirit and then he will guide you on some of these individual things especially things that are not written in the Bible or brother bam doesn't have an think about it because I know here in Africa many churches and preachers are opposed to football as if it is a sin I for one do not believe football is a sin but I believe that if you come to the Lord and you really are filled with the Holy Ghost your desires will not be on things below it will be on things above you know you will uh your appetites will change how how many have you ever seen a pregnant woman their appetite changes you see that's what I want to say on that you find people watching football walking at night going to watch football I believe that uh if you are a born again Son of God you'll have different appetites yes why didn't you give her a microphone there are some people streaming and they would want to hear the question CU me I used to watch those Z football matches and after I was used to bating I could could put that my mind and after thinking that I'm going to get more but they told they told me that brother told me that it is it is bad okay then comes these things connected to football cards and other things now that one is outrightly a sin cuz I believe betting is a sin Christians don't bet um it's scriptural it's biblical I don't have time to go into all the scriptures but if you want it you will come and and see me I'll give you the scriptures and so but football in itself is no sin but those things attached to it no you know you find you find uh a lot of things attached to these things um and in the church ede book brother bam also says the people of the world when they are watching football their football matches they are so what excit excited and enthused about it and they shout but for us but for us who are children of God when we we in church and hearing the word of God we also get excited and Shout like they do when they're watching their football matches and then they don't like us for shouting and yet they they want themselves to shout you get a point when I when I read that I felt like ah so theirs ours theirs ours what is our team our team is the scoring team and that is the team of our Lord Jesus Christ so I I believe that we should be focused on that and and not the not the latter all right could you please elaborate one brother Bam's prophecies who asked this question because I need you to elaborate on your question please it's a good question yeah give him a microphone let him let him uh keep that microphone on so that uh I meant I meant could you please what elaborate on R's prophecies that he had what do you mean you want me to tell you the prophecies he had he gave yes you don't know any I know I know but I'm not so uh you know I need to understand your question because I want to understand the magnitude of it do you want me to tell you all the prophecies brother bham gave or you've what's the background of your question okay let me give an example of a prophecy of this American woman e and who is on the on the camera can this camera turn yes giving an example of this American woman not I really I just see people talking but I don't really about it oh the vice president of the US yes oh okay so brother banam gave seven prophecies that 19 1933 and he say that these prophecies will come to pass before the end all of them seven prophecies and almost all of them have come to pass except for I think about one which is um the destruction of the US by Russia and uh also all the others I think have all come to pass one of them was that America will have a woman president or a vice president and remember this was before America allowed women to vote can you imagine that and he would see a woman being a vice president or a president meaning a woman of influence in America and he even for told how she would be dressed and it happened exactly and so this is that was just one of the prophecies he also for told about um musolini invading um uh Ethiopia and it also came to pass and many other prophecies I think if you come to me I'll give you a full list of them there are many other prophecies that he has told and uh they have all come to pass okay what is suffering and how do you know that you are a victim H this is a difficult one now for me because I can tell you what suffering is but again you cannot know what suffering is unless you experience it um who has who has ever gone through suffering and they defeated it and they have a testimony and can explain to us what suffering is please anybody ah all of you have never gone through suffering yes you have God bless you last time I went to school for those past months a few months I joined late so I had to suffer that you know when I was joining the director told me so Dixon you're going to suffer locally why why these people had already the C might did that the certificate had changed bch changes every five years so it has it had changed so what I did was meaning nothing so I had to do an extra a b a big work so I had to do like 10 units in that period of time and this people that I I was with they were doing only three units so you see now this teacher needs his assessment the other one like five teachers need their assessments you one person within a few time and I used to come here on weekends I don't have time to do so I us to suffer in that way but I thank God it it has all come to the end that I finished all so you were a victim of suffer and kind of uh look at that so uh this brother is um saying that he suffered at school and suffering can be I think to me like your was physical suffering or mental suffering you can have mental suffering physical suffering spiritual suffering when you being tormented or when you're going through a difficult time or when you are poor sometimes when you are poor you have no money you are going to suffer financially how many have suffered financially before you have no food you have no transport you have no money to pay bills some of you you have no money to pay rent and you are suffering terribly you don't have anyone to ask money from and you are suffering suffering comes in many forms sometimes you can be with someone who is abusing you mentally physically or spiritually in many ways and you see these things will make you suffer in many different ways so suffering you know when you a victim surely you know when you're a victim and I think uh that one answers that but God delivers from every suffering amen all right we continue on here you know I am a youth right ah this is the one I was telling you about you know I am a youth right there are some Temptations and sometimes you fall for them cuz you know no one's looking at you how can you resist receive the Holy Spirit when you receive the Holy Spirit he will be with you at all times he abides In You by the way the holy spirit is the only solution for this answer the by the way to some of you who have not Holy Spirit or who have never had an experience find it you you will get it find it when you receive the Holy Spirit you know and when it happens to you you realize you have a secret power to be able to overcome The Temptations you've been going through and you'll be able to resist because he gives you what we would call self-control I am someone can someone leave brother bham and go with the Bible hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah again that's a good question can someone leave by the banam and go with the Bible now I don't know what you meant but I don't believe that anybody is going with brother bam to begin with who is going with brother bam here some people are now shocked Pastor what do you mean who said I don't believe brother bam is Malachi 4 who said I don't believe by bam is the prophet who said I don't believe that brother bam has revealed all the mysteries of the Bible but let me ask you a question did Brother banam come to lead you to brother bham yes sister brother bham came to lead you to brother bham brother bham came to lead you to who actually I've never found any message of any other man you find every message the message of Billy Graham or Roberts even some of the our preachers here like kakan gra and others all their messages is pointing to themselves I'm the man I'm the man I'm the man but the message of brother bam has pointed people to Jesus Christ and that's why I follow it with all my heart and there is no way you can understand the Bible fully without believing the message of brother bam maybe if your question was can I leave the message of brother bam and go with the Bible how possible is it let me put it to a test come here brother stand right here with your microphone right there on the platform I I want to put this to a test can you leave by Bam by Bam's message and go with the Bible I don't care what your answer will be yes or no I want to ask you a question are you baptized can you speak through the microphone yes I'm baptized um in what name Lord Jesus Christ how did you know that before you heard about the message of by bam were you baptized like that no no ah do you believe in one God yes what is his name Lord Jesus Christ so did you know that before the message of brother bam no no oh so Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden had an apple did they have an apple did they eat an apple yes or no no no uhhuh what actually was done do you had sex so typic can answer from a young man it was adultery right okay they had adultery she had adultery that was the original scene how did you know that did you know that before the message of brother banam no no ah what what else then do you know about the Bible you believe in the Rapture yes uh who is going to go in the Rapture me did you know that before the message of brother bam came to you I was in process you were in process you were not sure so can I say because of the message ofam you became sure yes and you sure you not going to be left yes you are 100% sure because of the message of brother bam yes so then tell me can you put the message of B ban side and still go to the Bible no now if you say you will you are lying because the message ofam has already brought you to the truth do you understand that illustration so anybody who will say they are leaving brother Bam's message they are lying if they're leaving brother Bam's message they should leave all the revelations behind and if you leave all the revelations behind you leaving the Bible the message and the Bible is one amen praise God let me now quickly try to sum up here how can a friend how can a gifted believer live for example if they are gifted with dancing H can they okay can they dance traditional dances [Music] EG raraka maganda TW TW dance TW what is TW what is twer dance okay we have known it is a dance if they are gifted in such a dancing and in message churches we do less dancing ah now let me tell you culture is not bad as long as it does not crash with the word but the moment culture crashes with the word then it becomes bad I've seen most of these people when they are going to dance they begin by painting themselves like um this how do they call them how do we call the whether they're dancing kadodi or they doing imalu or they doing whatever you know they they they paint themselves like um brother bam used the word what is it heathens now what we call heathens we Christians what we call heathens is our traditions did you know that did you know that heathenism is our Traditions I've been to kja in kja culturally they cut themselves culturally as a sign of beauty and maturity different kind of cuttings now when you were a Kong and you were a warrior you even do some paintings and you put some things to scare your you know to look like a warrior and you dress a certain way but the moment they believe those are the first things they change because they are believers but naturally Kong Dance by jumping you've seen some of is there any brother from Kong here k not today we have several of them in the church you see they jump they jump brother Solomon knows how they jump like how the Kong Brothers jump they jump so high until they almost hit the roof culturally they dance like that when they are when they dancing when they going to hunt or when they going to you know kill certain things or whatever now even Believers when they believed they left everything but they never left that kind of jumping because it doesn't clash with the message does it now you find some of the dances which are very sexual okay in some traditions you find you sincerely it is not calmly for a Believer to do that is it they they they act weird there are certain things Believers don't do because they act weird but if something does not clash with the when I went to Ethiopia Ethiopian people are very cultural people very cultural very cultural is the country in in Africa that is more cultural than any other because they were never colonized now in going to Ethiopia I found this Brothers they have many cultures they dancing they way of greeting you know they hug each other even boys and girls they hug and kiss you know so you find a sister kissing saying and then and then they also give gusa you know gusa feeding using the hands to your mouth you see if someone is close to you or your friend like these questions you have been asking if someone is my friend even if it's a boy or girl hey that's what they do they feed on the mouth they don't use a fork or a Spoon Hands bare hands feed you and then push it there so you see now when first the first time was being gred I had to sweat thank God my wife was there but it was a very tough time because these are people you want to preach to they have not yet understood the truth and if you refuse the grer it is almost like refusing them and how can they accept what you have that's why it is good to go on those mission trips with your wife or with a brother it's not good to go alone go with someone and so you see um but some but we had to bring it down to them and teach them some of the things of the cultures they had to leave them like you know hugging you know because we have been taught by the by our Prophet that you know hugging as long as you are a man as long as you are a man and you have blood in your in your body you cannot hug a woman and you remain the same is that a man that's the truth you cannot h a woman and remain the same because the blood that blood in you will begin going at a very first rate and before you know it something may happen you will not remain the same brother Dixon Don't Hug a sister you see that's why we don't hug sisters now for them they were hugging I had to show them that quote and I told them you see because theen and that's why our Prophet told us that and when you do it you you're fine I've seen some people who have told me Pastor I fail in sin because I was hugging sisters I was hugging them and then eventually yes it has happened and that's why we should follow what we are taught and uh we shall be fine so some of these cultural dances are not bad and others are bad how are you going to differentiate them if you have the spirit of God in you he will keep you away from some of those first of all the way they dress the costumes they use and uh you know other things they completely hiden and you want to stay away from those kind of things uh if you have a gift of dancing certainly it's a gift of dancing use it like David used it in the in the Church of the Living God I can tell whoever whoever asked this question you have not you have not expressed your gift here in the church yet and we need you whever you are come out come out not now don't worry I'm saying whoever you are come out see me we shall we shall encourage you to dance here in the church we believe in dancing do we we believe in dancing do we so we believe in dancing in the church don't say we don't dance so much we dance and we believe in dancing but not like the Pentecostal you know no you don't dance for God like that I don't believe David was even dancing like that and then they have all dressed no no no I don't believe that that you can dance like that for the Lord okay I have another question here is it okay to dance ah I didn't even know that this was uh connected is it okay to dance during family functions like graduations introductions and weddings how many say it is okay say yes how many say it is not say no ah is it okay to dance what is a what what is a wedding excuse me what is a wedding without Joy what is a wedding without dancing what is a wedding without singing what is a wedding without eating do you get the point but still the question is what kind of dancing you're not going to bring worldly dancing on a wedding because you are now having a wedding now you have even forgotten you a Believer you I be a believer on Sunday morning but for now I am on a I should dance how can you do that you a Believer and you should dance like a Believer so some difference between you and the world you need to come to weddings in Ethiopia oh those people they shook the whole uh religious fraternity there they dance but their dances are spiritual hey very good dancers Dance one day we were dancing on a wedding of one of the people dancing you know even they come together like that and they begin dancing they begin rejoicing you know like that and you know they dance like this they dance like this they dance like this then they begin jumping and now uh one person came in so sister sister yodit I love sister yodit she called me and said see see this one this one is bringing World dances here now if you are new in Ethiopia you would be like what is she talking about because both of them like are they not world but the difference they know the difference even among their own people cuz the other one we dancing kind of good dances that are not you coming to dance like that because you on a wedding you can't do that there a wrong spirit in you you have not yet receive the Holy Spirit you see and if you have the Holy Spirit you cannot do that whether it is on a family whether it is on your wedding or on a believer's wedding even the songs you listen to or you play on your wedding you people who are going to marry let me tell you you should show others the kind of things you believe bring God on your wedding when you lift God on your wedding God will lift you in your life and in your marriage but if you live the world and you please them God will leave you alone all right is it wrong for a black person to marry a white person H who is this one that want wants to marry a white person let me see you you see you are not wanting to be seen should I also say that you should come to me privately so I can first know who you are and your intentions so then I will answer you privately okay why was sin made why were why were we punished for Adam and Eve's mistake or crime no uh we are not being punished for Adam's mistake or crime in one way and in one way we are but um you need to understand that we were born in sin and of course why was sin made because because they believed not the word of God so they did not believe and because they not believe that became sin and because that became sin and they gave birth to Children according to the way of sin because you see we were not supposed to be born in the way we are born according to the lust of the flesh we were supposed to be born according to the will of God how by the word of God by the spoken word of God and God has now restarted the whole thing by Jesus Christ and he called Jesus Christ the firstborn of all creation Now Jesus when he was born he started a new creation which creation Now is born properly is born properly and anybody who is born according to the old birth they need to be born again when you are born again what happens when you are born again you are no longer bound by sin you are above sin and uh you cannot be punished for the sin of Adam because Jesus Christ removed it praise God how do you know your purpose in life that one is a very big one depending on who is asking and what they intending to know but I can tell you what I've been preaching on this many many times here the way to know the purp purp your purpose in life is to know the will of God for your life if the moment you know the will of God for your life you love God with all your heart you receive the Holy Spirit then the Holy Spirit Will begin to lead you direct your path show you things that you must do show you even what you must take as your purpose in life uh uh and some of you you know God will lead you into a career path he will lead you into what to do who to marry what to do and then you will focus if someone has purpose in life you will see them they will be different they'll be different they will do things differently I would call some young men here but I will not out of not others feeling that I'm not recognizing them but I know a few young men here who have purpose in life if you have purpose in life you are not going to be lazy you're not going to be found rumoring you know doing this and that in other busy in other men's matters you are going to be focused on what you want to pursue and I can tell you what you cannot have purpose in life until you receive the Holy Spirit until you truly receive God in your heart he will give you purpose in life um how does one resist I don't know this what is desperacy does desperacy me mean mean anything to you oh how does one resist to be desperate it's just like you asking me how can you resist being a human being desperation is part of human of being a human being as a matter of fact desperation is a good thing but the BAM preached a sermon on desperation go and listen to it uh let me see is it a what was it titled was it this desperation did you tit it desperation yeah desperations 1963 go and listen to it and you will know why you should be desperate and how you should be desperate and how desperation can help you who is a Believer exactly oh this is a good one some of these questions I can really spend much time on them but because I'm tired and time is fast spent and I want to over delay I'm now beginning to quickly answer them who is a Believer exactly can someone answer this one kindly if you know the answer come out and answer it no no one no not you you you have answered many times can sister all of you don't know who a Believer is hi do we have a believer in this house ah okay who are you give someone a microphone for them tell us who they are there's a sister right behind there she has an answer on your left on your left brother on your left sister who is a Believer exactly a Believer is someone who is filled with the Holy Spirit God bless you and that answers the question do we believe that do we believe that and you can't be filled with the Holy Spirit unless you believe the word every word of God then of course you get to be filled with the Holy Spirit does it mean people from other churches are not Believers H these questions are all connected I thought it is not a church that makes you a Believer all right now listen carefully I'll spend a little time on this one it is true uh you people I thought you were tired you are not tired you keep bringing in more questions okay listen does it mean people from other churches are not Believers I thought it is not a church that makes a Believer it is true it is not a church that makes a Believer but a Believer belongs to a church are you following me a Believer belongs to a church a church that preaches the truth so is every Church a believer's church please answer me every Church where even in the Catholic Church a Bible is read in the Anglican only the mo in the MOs they don't read bibles but there are many Bible churches that read the Bible but they actually not Believers of it when Jesus Christ came he found the sades and phes and he told them he called them uh you children of snakes serpents said he said you are you of your father the devil and and the works of your father you do why because they did not believe him yet they believed in Moses and they thought they were following Moses so in other words a Believer is not a Believer because he's called a Believer you can call yourself Full Gospel Church but the question is do you believe the Full Gospel you may call yourself Full Gospel but even when you don't baptize in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to begin with you're not a Believer because a Believer begins with accepting Christ as your personal savior not so what happens after accepting baptism not so Mark 16 go in the world preach the gospel to every one that believeth and is baptized everybody who believes and is baptized shall be so if you are not baptized correctly you are not a Believer to begin with so now you can go on narrowing it down uhhuh baptize like how according to how the apostles did it baptizing an adult who has heard who has accepted who has confessed and who has you know accepted Jesus as their savior then you baptize them in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then their sin your sins are washed away you receive the Holy Ghost now you can say you are a Believer so now it doesn't matter which church you go to if you don't have that basic it's the Bas B truth if you don't have that you not even having a right to call yourself a Believer you a believer of what now a believer of what a Believer is a believer of something not a Believer by name but a believer of something I hope that is answered appropriately why does God give us everything we need and always there is and always there for us and yet some people don't really believe and are not Christians I didn't even know that this question were going one after the other it's good for them to go that way some people will always not believe there is a a scripture which says what if some did not believe unbelief cannot hinder God the word of God is the word of God whether some don't believe or they believe still God is God and God will accomplish his will in his people and I'm happy that I believe so why does God give us everything we need and always there for us and yet some people don't really believe they are not going to believe some of them because they serpent seed and others may not believe because it's not your to reveal to them it may be revealed to them later so don't quickly say you are serpent seed I've seen people who do that you preach to someone another kid is your serent seed don't do that it's only God who knows those who are his you you don't know the person you're calling sereny today you may find them in Rapture when later on someone preach to them you see so and they believed without your knowledge God will bring his it may not be by you it may be by somebody else but his own will all come through and some will not believe because they seren SE period what will happen to babies of Believers in the Rapture wow what will happen to babies of Believers in the Rapture the babies of Believers what do you mean exactly huh the unborn babies or the babies who are already born or both ah [Music] yes a microphone who has the microphone that only those who will go to Rapture have the Holy Spirit but now the babies don't have like the Holy Spirit they be young I think that's I'm just thinking that's maybe what that person meant in this case your question should be what will happen to babies doesn't have to be of Believers because being a baby of believer doesn't make you a Believer right but I'll would say this the secret is this it's a scripture that God knoweth those that are his we don't go to heaven because of of believing or because of baptism or because of anything we do is that amen I just preached this morning we are accepted because we were chosen in him before the foundation of the world you see so whoever you were before the foundation of the world you will be nothing can stop it and in the rupture there's not going to be a baby it will all be young adults even there would not be an old man it will all be young adults 17 18 19 around there who is 19 years we are all going to be your age Hallelujah yeah in your youth we all going to be youth even me I will be younger my God the Rapture is a wonderful thing so because we will all turn younger no old man no baby no young we will all be young forever youth in our good good age so you see the Rapture is a wonderful thing and all those who are meant to be there will be there but when you come to your age of accountability and you hear if you were meant to be there you will accept if you refuse it is a sign you will not be there all right another question here in the Book of Genesis why did God say let us create man in our image who was God and who was God with to mean the hour image now this is a very good theological question which might take me time to answer and I'm not going to take time to answer it I'm going to give a very short answer if you if you are not uh if you are not if you are not satisfied then you will see me afterwards then I will clarify anybody who has asked a question you're not satisfied please see me afterwards and then we can take it on from there okay in the Book of Genesis why did God say why did God say let us so who are the US brother bam says it many many times here and I I may want to read something but because of time uh but uh in one point he says that uh we were attributes with him uh uh God dwelling with his own attributes how many is God how many is God one but is he one like your finger one like your finger no so what does that mean God is plural God is more than enough God is much yet he's one he's one in his nature he's one in his Essence he's one but yet he's more than enough not more than one but more than enough So within him were attributes and you were in him even Jesus Christ was in him cuz it was the logos that went out of him so you see th this is god with his attributes so whoever answered asked this question you must be theological theologically proper and I'm sure you might you have CAU something out of that and if you want a longer answer please come meet me I'll I'll go there are some questions have not sufficiently answered and I'm putting them on this side uh believing that whoever has asked them will come and then we can go a little deeper with them okay all right so I'm I'm almost I'm almost through total obedience to the to the total word entitles you to the Token how different is receiving the Holy Ghost I I don't think I understand let me see how different is receiving the holy spirit in Services prayer and by the token does anybody understand that question and can you clarify for me please yes who asked this question um can you clarify can you give him a microphone what the question is's asking about is the prophet said total obedience to the word entit you to the Token that's true now uh what about the instance where somebody is praying and he receives maybe some where somebody does what maybe they are preaching the word and somebody receives the Holy Spirit yes maybe we are in worship somebody receives the Holy Spirit how different is that from receiving the token which the prophet was meaning in that which there is in my understanding there is no difference the token is the holy spirit is that not so because in the message the token then he says that this is a token he gives the example of um someone that has a token and like a bu a bus token like a bus receipt that uh you need to give in order to be accepted on the bus so he says that now for for you in order to go in the Rapture you need a token you need to have that token with you and the token is the Holy Spirit you know it is tied and typed together with the virgins The Virgins needed to have the Holy Spirit in order to go with the bridegroom because there is where he says you can receive the Holy Spirit and still you go to hell with it and and still and still you go to hell with it yes yes but that is in no way saying receiving the holy spirit in your soul now I I want you to understand this people there is a difference between receiving the holy spirit in your soul and I think I was dealing with you on that and being Anointed with the Holy Spirit it on your spirit there are two there are three things number one God creates a a a new heart in you number two he fills you with a I I wish I had time to explain on them let me just throw more light God the first thing that God does when you come to him and you hear the word and he he he gives you a new heart because we are born with the the kind of Rocky hard Hearts whereby when the word of God comes we are hard we don't want to believe it we like M so now when the word of God comes you don't accept it nothing happens but the first thing the Holy Spirit does when he he comes he gives you a new heart now it's not another body's heart it's not God's heart he just gives you a new heart he renews your heart he gives you a brand new heart are you following me now we might say you have received the Holy Spirit but actually you've just accepted Jesus as your savior and he gave you a new heart which will cause you to repent last time I talked about a conviction of heart conviction comes from H please follow me closely here now conviction comes from what conviction comes from um um from being hearing the word and when you hear the word then you are convinced by what by the spirit because it says when he the spirit of Truth when the spirit of truth shall come what does he do he will convince you of Truth what is convincing convicting you of Truth so now you will be pierced in your heart and like them on the day of Pentecost said men and Brethren what shall we do so what is it it's the working of the Holy Spirit he has convicted you to believe he will change your heart and you receive a new heart now what is that it is the holy spirit but does it mean you are sealed you have received the token you are ready for the no you can still go to hell with that as much as you have believed but it's the beginning and then after that now you receive every word of God he will bring more word more you receive all that word you'll accept all that word now when you T believe all that word what will happen there is the second work that God will do in You by the power of the Holy Spirit and that is he will give you a new spirit now what's a new spirit each of us has a spirit and each of our spirit has five Doors Five Doors just like our body has five doors what are the doors to the body number one to see on the Through The Eyes to smell through the nose to hear through the ears to test through the tongue and to touch by the hands now all those are gats or doors to the body but then there is also gates and doors to the spirit conscious memory you know and others imaginations affection now all these doors you see Naturally Speaking you are born with that animalistic nature you are born like an animal you don't have regard for God even for yourself as a matter of fact many people they feel anger jealousy what else what else palice what else hatred huh huh Pride yeah what is that it is not in your heart but it is in your spirit you don't like others you are proud you are you know those kind of things when you are in the church and the word of God comes down so heavy you're like uh let the others say Amen but as as far as I'm concerned you see you know because your spirit is so proud and you even when you believe it you you you will be like yeah yeah it's all right but now when God gives you a new spirit brother brother bam says the new spirit will easily connect with the Holy Spirit Brother Sam do you know that what that means when the spirit of God comes in a service notice people who have a new spirit will easily be excitable when they receive the new spirit and the word of God comes on that they will just you know be excitable they will shout they will you know speak in tongues easily the gifts of the Spirit will even operating in them if they have a gift naturally it will operate in them through easily they will easily sayen they will accept the word of God and they will move and they'll be moved by the spirit of God why because they have a new spirit now now many people receive that a new spirit and they think they have received the Holy Spirit and even with that you can still go to hell because you've not yet been sealed so that's what B meant but when you come to the third and last level this is all in the scriptures you receive now the holy spirit in your soul because he says I'll give you I'll give you a new heart I'll give you a new spirit and then I'll give you my Spirit now this when you before I go to the SP the Holy Spirit when you see someone who has a new spirit they so good have you ever spoken to someone oh you say is very friendly very calm very nice and then all of a sudden you find out they were Christians they may not be Believers of the message but they were Christians because they they had a very soft and kind and welcoming Spirit how many know what I'm talking about very few you know what I'm talking about right that kind of spirit so when God gives you a new spirit it is not the Holy Spirit it is your spirit but a new one cuz the old one was very difficult even for yourself now he gives you a new one now when you receive the holy spirit that one it is God himself coming into your heart to seal you and when he seals you he abides he remains there he stays there until when the day of your Redemption that one is now the token you go through with it it you cannot it cannot be removed from you until you go into the Rapture I hope I I've answered that properly is that answered is that answered or what part remained sorry all right um I know we can explain it more read more quotes but um if maybe I can take a service on it pro probably and uh if you feel that it's not sufficiently answered for you you can meet privately or I can take a service on it and then clarify more all right is it okay for a gifted believer in singing to sing in a school choir or educational songs I don't find a problem with that as long as what you're singing is not satanic or does not praise and worship the devil I know of a scenario God bless you I know of a scenario where a sister was called blindly to go and visit a boy who was an unbeliever and she did not know the intention of the visit when she reached there the boy wanted to be in affairs with her and because she was scared of what would happen in case she refused she decided to accept thank God it never happened because the boy immediately became impotent but my question is what if that it had happened was it going to be called a mistake or fornication now this last question is not necessary reason being if you are a sister and you are virtuous you've kept yourself and uh you don't have intentions of going into immorality and even a man wants to rap you God can't permit it to happen try it I know what I'm talking about I've had very many testimonies to know that this is true and you yourself who has asked this you have given given another example of this same thing I'm talking about who made that man important you think it was by coincidence or you think the man was important it was God that made it happen now how about in scenarios where Believers were raped you will find in many circumstances even those who tell you they were raped Brothers if you are going to get and the sister tell you they were raped think twice in many circumstances they wanted it to happen I've seen it in many circumstances that they were overpowered and they themselves wanted it to happen but if you indeed do not want it to happen God knows you are in a weak place and God will fight for you he cannot let it happen to you if you do not want it I've had of a scenario where in a bush somewhere a Boy comes and is he he comes and deceives this system gives her soda they drink soda they drink soda and they drink soda sister says I want to go I want to go brother is saying no take more soda and the brother is taking his very slowly very slow the sister finishes her in 10 minutes because she wants to go home quickly but the brother finishes his slda in 1 hour so by the time the brother finishes his s says wait for me wait for me I finish he it is already night time and he says now it is time for us to go and um by the time he says it is time for us to go it is night and dark and the only person that she knows is this brother and this brother has to escort her first says let me take you so while they are going in the in the in the bush there in the thickets on the path where they were the walking you know the villages how they can be the brother turns into a monster say sister sister now I'm saying saying this the sister says brother what is wrong with you I thought you were a Believer what I talking about you know I want and right in in in that scenario you know in that place right at that place the sister they fight they fight knock each other the sister did not say after all there's no one to fight for me let me just accept because sister if she accepted it would happen but she said I will not accept she began calling God fight for me fight for me and then while she's also fighting then she hits the brother the brother gets knocked off and he falls to the ground and the place where he fell there was a snake waiting so the snake wraps itself in the brother and the Brother begin shouting oh help help help and while he's crying Help the sister takes off so that one did not was not stricken with a spirit of importance but God fought for her by sending a snake I've heard many stories of men coming to rap sisters and and they can't do anything we serve a living God so sister don't say I will tell this my husband I was raped no we don't believe in those stories unless he believes in it not not wor me I'm married already um but if it happen to you tell her tell him the truth if he he truly loves you he will believe it he will believe it amen all right um what do you say about this cultural thing of women pulling who who asked this one of women pulling the words continue but I'm going to stop there uh is it right for girls to do it now I do not believe that that is right to do it I think in English we call it genital mutilation or whatever it is I I I I I don't believe it is right for you to alter the way God has created you just like I don't believe makeup is good or earrings is good because all these things alter the way God has created you you know so just stay natural and that is Believers shouldn't be hard doing anything like that it is not spiritual it is against nature it is unnatural it is unnatural and it is meant to bring unnatural affection all right another question here God bless you Brothers in Jesus Christ name my question is is this teenage in this Teenage life when someone was still living in a worldly life and ends up receiving the the Revelation already having a child with an nonbeliever sometimes it affects me because I stand with the word but I try to tell her about the message but she continually pretends do we do we understand that portion what what does it mean in this Teenage life when someone was still living in in a word in a Wordly life and ends up receiving the Revelation already having a child with an unbeliever so is this a brother okay a brother having a child with an unbeliever okay sometimes it affects me because I stand uh with the word but I tried to tell her who is the her the mother of the girl about the message but she continually pretends and wants to have and what hurts me is I'm the mother and father because her mother died now I'm confused here I'm the mother and father because her mother died and she no longer stays with any of her relatives because oh the mother and father of this girl died so this boy is the mother and father of the of the girl with whom he has the child okay so says and um she no longer stays with any of her relatives because uh they are not financially well good enough I supported her and she went abroad for work but she changed she changed uh even Behavior more immorally than she was what HS is she takes the message for granted already my father has a question mark with her because of behaviors and my father is a Believer so now in my heart sometimes is is uh so in my heart sometimes uh you have to forgive me the handwriting is it's quite difficult to read uh sometimes is I hear a voice to me saying never marry an unbeliever as but you're married already as long as you have a child with her never Mar sometimes I hear a voice saying to me never Mar an unbeliever as long as you have a child with her or meaning even if you have a child with her does that mean that so I'm very confused whether I look at my child I be like I wish her mother knows where God brought her she would have let the world she would not have let the world the worldly things to go she would have let the worldly things to go so Pastor I've been mentally confused number one this is good that I've read it here to those of you who are planning to Mur an unbeliever you see where you can go you'll be confused this is a testimony and uh I've spoken to two people three people today like that so please don't go that area be very patient in finding a good Christian that you should marry once you do the mistake it's going to be a thorn that will unfortunately Pierce you all your life and uh there is nothing I as your pastor can do about it and for you who is asking this question question I'm asking that you meet me uh in private because I have questions to ask before I guide you on what to do so God bless you let us start on our feet hallelujah how many are happy amen and to those of you the one who asked is it wrong for a black person to marry a white person what I can speak publicly here is that uh Prophet has told us what would a black person want to marry a white person for for what why would you want to mix races you or we are a flower garden a flower garden of God God has black red yellow pink keep it the way it is keep it natural if you mix it then you don't get black you don't get white you get M children mixed no rest so your child will be white or black so you see it doesn't bother you but it will bother your children and you don't want that to happen to your children you find that uh there is also differences in culture if there are differences in culture here in our country how about when you are crossing even races so you need to be slow on those things and and focus on your race focus on your culture focus on your race that will save you a lot of trouble that is all I can say and to you who ask this question uh on the part of wrong on the part of wrong really I don't know whether I can take that biblically and say it is wrong there are many things that are not wrong biblically but everything that is not wrong does not mean that we should do it we have to think it through pray it through and find the will of God for what we ought to do praise God so I think it's been a fruitful time I said what is on my heart is there anybody else with something that you want to say nobody so it's it's a good it's a good let the musicians come we sing one song and then we we close we close with a word of prayer I would want a young man to to come here brother Samuel brother Samuel I will invite you to come and pray after we have sung this songs just to close for us amen after a while I'd like us to sing I want Cross Jordan Alone first of all we sing that and then we'll sing another one and then
