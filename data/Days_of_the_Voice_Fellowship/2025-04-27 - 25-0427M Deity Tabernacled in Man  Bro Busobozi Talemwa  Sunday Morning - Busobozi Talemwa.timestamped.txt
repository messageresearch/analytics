[1:40:33] us. Father, you have resurrected in our

[1:40:39] will in our lives. I commit every

[1:41:53] Omnet, God bless
[1:41:55] you. We are happy to see you this

[1:42:26] just walked in as I was coming
[1:42:28] in. Uh unfortunately, we do not have
[1:42:31] your
[1:42:33] names. Uh I think the deacons did not
[1:42:36] have a moment to take the names.
[1:42:40] But are they all your friends, Sister
[1:42:42] Ros? No. Okay. Um um I'd like maybe what

[1:48:57] sign but we only
[1:48:59] fellowship with one another here. And we
[1:49:02] believe that the blood of
[1:49:04] Jesus washes us from all
[1:49:06] sin. And we believe we are preparing
[1:49:10] ourselves for the coming of the
[1:49:12] Lord. Just feel at liberty to worship
[1:49:16] with us. Be a participant in
[1:49:20] meeting. Don't fear to say amen. Here we
[1:49:24] have liberty. You can shout, jump, you
[1:49:28] can be happy. If you smile, no one will
[1:49:32] stop
[1:49:32] you. Everybody will be happy with
[1:49:35] you. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[1:49:40] Sister, God bless you. Can you come over
[1:49:43] here? Uh this is the sister that some
[1:49:46] many of you did not
[1:49:49] know. Stand there and face the
[1:49:51] people. Uh that this is the sister that
[1:49:54] you
[1:49:55] helped and thank you so much for
[1:49:58] helping.
[1:50:00] and um you know because you know she was
[1:50:02] taken advantage of by those cornmen
[1:50:07] and uh she was in jail for is it three
[1:50:09] nights, three
[1:50:11] days. So um and um it was quite
[1:50:15] unfortunate and she works for you know
[1:50:18] how do they call it micro finance micro
[1:50:22] finance but I had a conversation with
[1:50:25] her and I advised her to always stay
[1:50:29] away from free
[1:50:32] things or from hot
[1:50:34] deals that you are going to benefit from
[1:50:37] and you never labored for
[1:50:39] them. And I wanted to say that because
[1:50:42] some of you might also fall
[1:50:45] pregnant. And I heard that even sister
[1:50:49] Esther, where is sister
[1:50:52] Esther? Is she here this morning?
[1:50:56] Her
[1:50:58] employee suffered the same
[1:51:01] problem. How much was she
[1:51:04] duped? One point 1.2
[1:51:10] I heard I I couldn't call you because I
[1:51:11] did not know what to tell you. I
[1:51:14] pray and and so um you you know if you
[1:51:18] want to consult sister
[1:51:20] Esther because this is her
[1:51:23] capital doing business with this
[1:51:26] money you know someone called a worker
[1:51:29] and as if they were sent by sister
[1:51:32] [Music]
[1:51:33] Esther when Esther was
[1:51:36] here and by the time that she realized
[1:51:38] she was being
[1:51:40] cheated all the money was finished
[1:51:43] and they wanted
[1:51:45] more. So friends, we should be on the
[1:51:49] lookout. We the world we are living in.
[1:51:52] People are not good. It is only Jesus
[1:51:54] Christ who makes us
[1:51:56] good. So thank you for standing with
[1:51:58] this
[1:51:59] sister. She was in jail because of your
[1:52:03] help and she was able to leave the
[1:52:06] jail. And um sister we still have I
[1:52:09] don't remember how much but after the
[1:52:11] service you should see the treasurers so
[1:52:13] that they can hand over
[1:52:18] that. Amen. And um also sister
[1:52:24] Baka made me understand that she
[1:52:27] traveled to
[1:52:30] Karamoja because she still has a leave
[1:52:34] call it the maternal maternal
[1:52:39] And so she she figured she could use the
[1:52:41] time also go and be with her husband for
[1:52:43] a
[1:52:46] wedding. She told me one or two
[1:52:49] weeks, but she sent her
[1:52:52] greetings. Amen. Uh lastly, I also want
[1:52:56] to appreciate brother
[1:52:58] Martin and and the other ministers
[1:53:02] uh standing with him on
[1:53:04] Sunday. and also thank you for praying
[1:53:06] for us. We had a successful trip in
[1:53:09] Kenya
[1:53:12] um in the convention there in Kaos
[1:53:16] um with the brother Keith Raid from
[1:53:20] Jamaica. He preached about I think about
[1:53:22] three or two
[1:53:25] meetings and I took one and uh then we
[1:53:29] traveled back on on the Monday morning.
[1:53:32] Pastor and the believers in
[1:53:38] Kenya, Pastor Kith also was
[1:53:42] here in an interview. We had an
[1:53:44] interview with
[1:53:47] him on the bench. So if you missed it
[1:53:51] out, I'd like to encourage you to go and
[1:53:53] listen,
[1:53:54] especially especially the the
[1:53:57] youth. He had quite a lot of outstanding
[1:54:00] things to say.
[1:54:03] I mean, he's someone who is a pastor,
[1:54:05] full-time pastor,
[1:54:07] um, missionaries,
[1:54:10] travel all over the
[1:54:12] world. Um, you know, he is a
[1:54:17] businessman as well as he's a he works
[1:54:19] for a multinational
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] company, but also he's a
[1:54:25] lecturer. He has a wealth of knowledge
[1:54:28] and information.
[1:54:30] So in my interaction with him as we were
[1:54:32] coming from
[1:54:34] Kenya we needed to um give that
[1:54:37] information to the to the
[1:54:40] youth. So please go and listen to it on
[1:54:44] the YouTube. It will be a blessing to
[1:54:47] you.
[1:54:49] Amen. Um shall we stand on our
[1:54:52] feet and we can now read the word.
[1:54:58] Thank you musicians. That's what we're
[1:54:59] singing for now.
[1:55:04] We are reading out of the book of Luke
[1:55:06] chapter
[1:55:11] 2. Uh when we are packed like this,
[1:55:14] sometimes there can be warmth and if
[1:55:16] you're not careful, you may find
[1:55:17] yourself
[1:55:21] dozing. So be on the lookout for
[1:55:25] sleep and uh if you see your neighbor
[1:55:29] sleeping as you tap on
[1:55:33] them especially those who have breakfast
[1:55:35] in the
[1:55:37] morning sleep can come
[1:55:40] easily. So make make sure you don't
[1:55:46] do praise God.
[1:55:50] Luke chapter 2
[1:55:53] 8 we are reading um up to verses
[1:55:59] 20 so I'm going to read in English and
[1:56:02] then when we see it the brother will
[1:56:03] read
[1:56:07] in and there were in the same country
[1:56:09] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[1:56:11] watch over their flock by night and lo
[1:56:14] the angel of the Lord came upon them and
[1:56:15] the glory of the Lord shone around about
[1:56:17] them and they were so afraid
[1:56:19] And the angel said unto them, "Fear not,
[1:56:21] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:56:23] great joy, which shall be to all people.
[1:56:25] For unto you is born this day in the
[1:56:27] city of David, as a savior, which is a
[1:56:29] savior rather, which is Christ the Lord.
[1:56:32] And this shall be a sign unto you, ye
[1:56:35] shall find a babe wrapped in swaddling
[1:56:37] clothes, lying in a manger." And
[1:56:39] suddenly there was with the angel a
[1:56:42] multitude of the of the heavenly host
[1:56:46] praising God and saying, "Glory to God
[1:56:48] in the highest and on the earth, peace,
[1:56:50] good will toward men." And it came to
[1:56:52] pass as the angels were gone away from
[1:56:54] them into heaven, the shepherds said to
[1:56:56] one another, "Let us now go even unto um
[1:57:00] unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which
[1:57:03] is come to pass, which the Lord has made
[1:57:06] known unto us." And they came with haste
[1:57:09] and found Mary and Joseph and a babe
[1:57:11] lying in a manger. And when they had
[1:57:13] seen it, and made known up and um they
[1:57:16] made known abroad the saying which was
[1:57:19] told them according uh concerning this
[1:57:21] child. And all they that heard it
[1:57:25] wondered at those things which were told
[1:57:27] them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all
[1:57:30] these things and pondered them in her
[1:57:33] heart. And the shepherds returned
[1:57:35] glorifying and praising God for all the
[1:57:38] things that they had heard and seen as
[1:57:41] it was told unto them. Let us first
[1:57:44] pray.
[1:57:46] Our loving Jesus, once again we come
[1:57:47] before
[1:57:49] you. I thank you for the people, the
[1:57:52] visitors visiting today for their first
[1:57:55] time, those coming again and the those
[1:57:59] who attend church here. Lord, we know
[1:58:02] also there are others
[1:58:04] streaming perhaps from many uh countries
[1:58:08] away long
[1:58:11] distances. Father, you know each heart.
[1:58:14] You know each need. Lord, I pray that
[1:58:16] you will use me today as a
[1:58:19] best uh unto your to minister to your
[1:58:22] children according to their
[1:58:24] needs. There's nothing good. I
[1:58:27] have no abilities within myself. But if
[1:58:31] you can help me Lord, I I know that you
[1:58:34] your children will be
[1:58:35] blessed. Father, we commit this service
[1:58:37] into
[1:58:38] Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Please
[1:58:43] be
[1:58:43] seated. As the brother reads in
[1:58:50] Luganda, Fore

[2:00:17] [Music]
[2:00:25] [Music]
[2:00:45] Amen. God bless you. Now, uh this text
[2:00:48] we have read today, we usually read it
[2:00:49] on days like maybe Christmas.
[2:00:54] But uh you see our
[2:00:56] Christmas is not a
[2:00:59] day our
[2:01:01] Christmas is the birth of
[2:01:04] Christ. And we believe he was not only
[2:01:07] born 2,000 years
[2:01:10] ago. We believe he's born today in our
[2:01:14] hearts. When you receive the Holy
[2:01:16] Spirit, you have received he is born in
[2:01:19] your heart.
[2:01:21] So, we are not really worshiping a Jesus
[2:01:23] that was here 2,000 years
[2:01:26] ago. We are worshiping a Jesus that is
[2:01:29] here today in our
[2:01:32] ministry. The Bible says in Hebrews
[2:01:35] 13:8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[2:01:38] and today and
[2:01:40] forever. So, if he was born then, he's
[2:01:43] born
[2:01:44] today. So, this is also appropriate
[2:01:47] today. And also when we talk about
[2:01:50] Easter, the
[2:01:52] resurrection, he's
[2:01:54] resurrected, not 2,000 years ago. Is
[2:01:58] resurrected
[2:01:59] today. So what I'm trying to say is the
[2:02:01] gospel we are preaching is a gospel of
[2:02:05] today. We are preaching the the gospel
[2:02:08] of the
[2:02:09] now because our God is the God of the
[2:02:11] now.
[2:02:13] So if you have a problem
[2:02:15] now, he is going to address your problem
[2:02:19] now because he brings spiritual food
[2:02:23] inducing. And I'm speaking on a subject
[2:02:26] deity tabernacled in
[2:02:33] man. Amen. So now the whole story
[2:02:36] started in
[2:02:38] heaven and then onto the garden. And you
[2:02:41] will know why I read this
[2:02:43] scripture. Stay with me. And please to
[2:02:45] avoid sleeping, keep saying amen to the
[2:02:49] word. Amen. The devil thought he had he
[2:02:52] would defeat
[2:02:53] God. And you know how he he wanted to
[2:02:58] ascend to the to the above the stars of
[2:03:02] God. He thought he would defeat God. But
[2:03:05] you know God cannot be
[2:03:07] defeated because he is the master
[2:03:12] strategy. God has seen the
[2:03:14] [Music]
[2:03:15] end right from the
[2:03:18] beginning. That is
[2:03:21] generally but also that is also about
[2:03:23] your
[2:03:25] life. God has seen your
[2:03:28] end right at the
[2:03:31] beginning. And where was the
[2:03:33] beginning? He is the beginning. So where
[2:03:37] were you before the beginning? You were
[2:03:40] in him before the beginning. And God saw
[2:03:44] you in him before the beginning. So he
[2:03:48] knows how you will
[2:03:50] end. He knows how you will end. We are
[2:03:53] not here living you know waiting just to
[2:03:56] see what will happen to
[2:03:59] us. We know what will happen to us.
[2:04:03] We know what is happening to us. We know
[2:04:06] where we are going because we know where
[2:04:09] we came from. I will tell you where I
[2:04:11] came from. I came from God. I go back to
[2:04:15] God. Amen. And I know where I am going.
[2:04:19] So I am not living in the world by
[2:04:22] mistake. I was not born by mistake. I
[2:04:26] was not born of the will of man. But I
[2:04:29] was born of the will of God.
[2:04:31] The Bible says man born of a woman is of
[2:04:33] a few days full of
[2:04:37] trouble. But I'm not born by a
[2:04:39] woman. I am not born by a woman. My body
[2:04:44] was not. Who am I? I am on the inside. I
[2:04:49] am I'm a soul. I'm a soul. Amen. And I
[2:04:54] was not born by a
[2:04:55] woman. I came in this body after it was
[2:04:59] born.
[2:05:01] I was with God from the foundation of
[2:05:04] God and that's where I am
[2:05:07] going. Amen. Praise the name of the
[2:05:10] Lord. We should stop seeing things the
[2:05:12] way we
[2:05:14] see. It is beyond what you
[2:05:19] see. Amen. Amen. And so the devil
[2:05:22] thought he would defeat
[2:05:23] God. But God is a master
[2:05:26] strategy. You know, you always sees the
[2:05:29] end from the
[2:05:30] beginning. He had it all planned
[2:05:33] out. God has your life
[2:05:37] planned. There is actually, let me tell
[2:05:39] you this. There is nothing going wrong
[2:05:40] with
[2:05:42] you. Even when you think things are
[2:05:44] going, there is nothing going wrong.
[2:05:48] That's why we are
[2:05:50] believers. We believe in what the word
[2:05:52] says.
[2:05:54] We don't believe in what our situations
[2:05:56] are
[2:05:58] saying. We don't believe in what our
[2:06:00] friends are
[2:06:02] saying. We don't even believe in what we
[2:06:04] are
[2:06:06] feeling. Don't even believe in what has
[2:06:08] happened to
[2:06:10] us. That does not define
[2:06:14] us. Your feelings don't define
[2:06:17] you. Your circumstances don't define
[2:06:20] you.
[2:06:22] You may be jobless right now, but that
[2:06:25] doesn't define you. You may have lost a
[2:06:29] scholarship, but that doesn't define
[2:06:31] you. You don't know how you're going to
[2:06:33] eat
[2:06:34] food after church is over. You may not
[2:06:38] even have
[2:06:45] tr. I want you to see beyond
[2:06:48] you. I want you to know you have a say.
[2:06:52] I want you to know you have a redeemer.
[2:06:54] I want you to know you are defined by
[2:06:56] the
[2:06:58] word. The word defiles
[2:07:00] me. If you want to see my birth
[2:07:04] certificate. It is right here. This
[2:07:08] tells my
[2:07:09] father. It tells where I came from. I am
[2:07:12] not of this world. I come from God. I go
[2:07:16] back to God. And you know what? This is
[2:07:18] exactly what Jesus
[2:07:21] was. And when he said it, they didn't
[2:07:24] understand it. He looked at them. They
[2:07:27] knew he was born in a
[2:07:29] manger. They knew he was born without a
[2:07:32] father. They knew he was an illegitimate
[2:07:35] child. But he looked at them and he told
[2:07:38] them, "I come from God. I go back to
[2:07:41] God." Jesus saw beyond his
[2:07:44] circumstances.
[2:07:48] They knew he was a carpenter. His father
[2:07:51] is a carpenter. But when he opened his
[2:07:54] mouth to
[2:07:55] speak, he did not claim he was a father.
[2:07:58] He was a son of a
[2:07:59] carpenter. He actually said to Joseph
[2:08:02] and Mary. When they came saying, "Oh, we
[2:08:05] were looking for me and your father. We
[2:08:07] were looking
[2:08:08] for Jesus turned." And he said, "What?
[2:08:12] Don't you know I'm supposed to be about
[2:08:15] my father's
[2:08:18] business? Your father is not Sagico.
[2:08:22] Your father is not
[2:08:24] Henry. Your father is not Are you
[2:08:26] getting the point? Your father Who is
[2:08:29] your
[2:08:30] father? What's your
[2:08:38] tribe? That's the problem we have.
[2:08:41] We see things according to our birth,
[2:08:44] natural
[2:08:46] birth. But there is another spiritual
[2:08:50] birth. I don't want you to see things in
[2:08:52] the as according to the order of the
[2:08:54] natural
[2:08:57] birth. Because if you look at it that
[2:08:59] way, then you will be defeated before
[2:09:02] you even
[2:09:03] start. Many things about our natural
[2:09:05] birth are disgusting.
[2:09:08] the way we were born, the parents that b
[2:09:11] us right now I've had recently we've
[2:09:14] been having
[2:09:15] issues in our home. Even my uncle is
[2:09:19] here been assisting us and my mother is
[2:09:22] here and we've been going back there to
[2:09:25] try and help and you know uh issues in
[2:09:28] my
[2:09:29] family. My father having many other
[2:09:31] women
[2:09:33] and trying to you know but this was a
[2:09:35] priest
[2:09:37] a preacher of the gospel but you know he
[2:09:40] backsle I do not know what seed is in
[2:09:42] him but if it is a seed gene of
[2:09:45] God all those things will not
[2:09:48] matter that's what I'm trying to say but
[2:09:51] according to the natural birth if I look
[2:09:53] at myself as a son of my father the next
[2:09:57] thing I will say I am I better than my
[2:10:01] fathers then you also get other women
[2:10:05] just like my Am I better than
[2:10:09] them? You get the point? That's my
[2:10:12] natural
[2:10:13] birth. So if you want to know my
[2:10:16] history according to my natural
[2:10:19] birth, some of it is
[2:10:23] disgusting, so is
[2:10:25] yours. Even if you were born by a man
[2:10:28] and a woman who were married and in a
[2:10:30] good
[2:10:32] home, that does not mean anything.
[2:10:36] Why? Because you were born in
[2:10:40] sin. You are come to the world speaking
[2:10:43] lies. So everything about our natural
[2:10:47] birth is not pleasing, is not
[2:10:51] exciting because it is not promising
[2:10:54] anything. But the
[2:10:57] grave, that's the only thing it is
[2:11:00] promising. Born to die, be buried. and
[2:11:04] the person who was born. That's why
[2:11:06] clans and families and you know tribes
[2:11:09] some of them you find they have
[2:11:13] graveyards and they say this is where
[2:11:15] they bury those who came out of so and
[2:11:20] so. That's why when you die they will
[2:11:24] take you and bury you
[2:11:26] there. I'm talking about
[2:11:28] you. If you die in this flesh they will
[2:11:31] take you and bury you there.
[2:11:35] I hope I don't get get to ever bury any
[2:11:37] of
[2:11:39] you. But sometimes even when a sister or
[2:11:42] brother
[2:11:43] dies, the clan members may refuse the
[2:11:47] preacher who was preaching to him to
[2:11:49] come and marry
[2:11:51] them. No, for us here in our clan, we
[2:11:55] are Catholics. We are
[2:11:58] Anglicans. We are Mormons. So we have
[2:12:01] the way we do our own
[2:12:04] things. We don't know you. You see, we
[2:12:08] have claimed what belongs to
[2:12:10] them, the flesh. But where are you? You
[2:12:14] are not in that flesh. You are not even
[2:12:17] going to be buried in that
[2:12:20] land. Amen. Amen. A believer has their
[2:12:25] owner. Hallelujah. Amen. when all the
[2:12:28] Old Testament
[2:12:30] saints died from Abraham, even Job
[2:12:35] himself,
[2:12:38] you know, from right from Job,
[2:12:41] Abraham and all those patriots. They
[2:12:44] were buried in one place and that was
[2:12:49] called they all even even Joseph whose
[2:12:53] bones were in Egypt, it made them
[2:12:56] promise Promise me my children when I
[2:13:00] die. You will carry my bones. I will
[2:13:03] take them
[2:13:04] back and bury me at
[2:13:07] Mel. You remember it was Abraham that
[2:13:11] actually bought that piece of land. And
[2:13:13] he he he wanted they wanted to give it
[2:13:15] for him to him for free. He said, "No, I
[2:13:18] will buy it. I will because my God is
[2:13:21] rich."
[2:13:23] The place where they were buried was
[2:13:26] bought, was paid for by their great
[2:13:30] great great
[2:13:32] grandfather, the one who had the
[2:13:35] confidence called Abraham. Are you
[2:13:38] following me? But now we see that is the
[2:13:41] Old
[2:13:41] Testament. These things happen
[2:13:43] physically. But to the church, the
[2:13:46] gentile church, we all have
[2:13:49] a we have a place where we can be buried
[2:13:54] where all
[2:13:55] believers doesn't matter
[2:13:57] your doesn't matter your class. It
[2:14:00] doesn't matter your national
[2:14:02] origin. When you die, you are buried
[2:14:05] there. And when you when you die, you
[2:14:09] when you die, you die when you reject
[2:14:11] the
[2:14:12] word. You die when you accept Jesus
[2:14:15] Christ. And you are born
[2:14:18] again, not of flesh, and you're born
[2:14:21] again of the
[2:14:23] spirit. That which is born of flesh is
[2:14:26] flesh. And that which is born of spirit
[2:14:30] is Jesus told
[2:14:32] Nicodemus, not said unto you, you must
[2:14:36] be born again. Tell your neighbor, you
[2:14:39] must be born
[2:14:40] again. when you are born
[2:14:42] again in Christ.
[2:14:46] Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Now, I did not
[2:14:49] plan to read this,
[2:14:50] but for a good foundation, let us read
[2:14:53] it.
[2:14:54] Romans quickly. Go to
[2:14:57] Romans. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:15:00] Chapter
[2:15:01] 6. You will see it right
[2:15:06] there. Okay, listen.
[2:15:10] Know ye not vers
[2:15:12] three. Know ye not that so many of us as
[2:15:14] we are baptized into Jesus Christ, we
[2:15:16] are baptized into his
[2:15:22] death. Therefore, we are buried with
[2:15:28] him
[2:15:29] baptism into death. that like as Christ
[2:15:32] was raised up from the
[2:15:35] dead by the glory of the father, even so
[2:15:39] we
[2:15:40] also should walk in the newness of life.
[2:15:43] For if we have been planted
[2:15:46] together in the likeness of his
[2:15:49] death, we shall also be in the likeness
[2:15:52] of his
[2:15:54] resurrection. Amen. Where is our old
[2:15:57] man that was born by nature?
[2:16:01] The old man was crucified with
[2:16:04] him that the body of sin might be
[2:16:10] destroyed that henceforth we should not
[2:16:12] serve
[2:16:13] sin. For he that is dead is freed from
[2:16:17] sin. If we we be dead with Christ, we
[2:16:21] believe also we shall live with
[2:16:22] him. Praise in the name of the Lord,
[2:16:25] knowing that Christ being raised from
[2:16:26] the
[2:16:28] dead no more. Death has no more dominion
[2:16:31] over
[2:16:33] him. Amen. Amen. That's why someone who
[2:16:37] is born
[2:16:39] again, they cannot die. I cannot die.
[2:16:44] Amen. Amen. I shall live to declare the
[2:16:47] the praises and the goodness of the Lord
[2:16:49] in the life of the
[2:16:50] living. Amen. If we are born again, we
[2:16:54] cannot die.
[2:16:56] You see me here the way you are seeing
[2:16:57] me here. I cannot be killed.
[2:17:04] And I'm not the only one.
[2:17:07] You too. You cannot
[2:17:09] be. The Bible says fear
[2:17:11] him. Don't fear him who can kill the
[2:17:15] flesh but can't touch your
[2:17:17] soul. Fear him who can kill both your
[2:17:21] flesh and destroy your soul.
[2:17:24] What will you give for your soul if you
[2:17:28] live in this world and you don't care
[2:17:31] about the word? Your soul will be
[2:17:35] destroyed. But if you live in this world
[2:17:38] and you make the word the most important
[2:17:40] thing in your
[2:17:41] life, you will never
[2:17:44] die. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:17:48] And so that's our true
[2:17:51] origin. I came from God. I go back to
[2:17:54] God. God had my life planned
[2:17:57] out. The devil thought he had
[2:18:00] won. But God had everything
[2:18:03] planned. All right. I want us to look at
[2:18:05] the I want to paint a picture for
[2:18:07] you. The devil had a plan.
[2:18:11] But you see the devil cannot have one
[2:18:14] plan because the devil will always
[2:18:17] change
[2:18:19] ideas because he doesn't know what will
[2:18:22] work and what may fail. But God is God.
[2:18:27] His plan is the only
[2:18:29] plan and it will always work. So the
[2:18:32] plan he has for your life is the only
[2:18:36] plan. Now let me tell you the blood he
[2:18:39] had for your
[2:18:40] life before you were born the same blood
[2:18:43] he
[2:18:44] had there is nothing going to
[2:18:48] happen. You will make God say let me
[2:18:51] change the plan because this has failed
[2:18:55] which means you will
[2:18:57] fail. Many times you will be
[2:19:01] disappointed many times. But God has
[2:19:03] never been
[2:19:05] disappointed. God has never failed.
[2:19:08] Because the plan he had been
[2:19:10] given concerning my life, concerning
[2:19:14] your life is the same plan he
[2:19:18] had. Amen. Sometimes you feel like you
[2:19:23] are
[2:19:24] spiritual. Sometimes you feel you're
[2:19:27] very
[2:19:28] calm. Sometimes you feel like singing.
[2:19:32] Sometimes you feel
[2:19:33] like sometimes things are good,
[2:19:37] sometimes things are bad and then you
[2:19:39] say, "I have
[2:19:40] changed. I think the way I was doing
[2:19:42] this is not right. Let me change it."
[2:19:46] Then you'll go seek for
[2:19:48] counsel pastor what do you think mommy?
[2:19:51] What do you think? Adise me here because
[2:19:54] I'm doing like this but things didn't
[2:19:57] work out. Don't you think you
[2:20:00] have I been doing this wrong and then
[2:20:03] you will go change it. That's us human
[2:20:07] beings. But that's not
[2:20:10] God.
[2:20:11] God
[2:20:13] thought the very first thing he
[2:20:17] thought and he
[2:20:19] spoke cannot be
[2:20:22] changed. The word of God is
[2:20:25] forever in heaven.
[2:20:29] Now can I preach to you
[2:20:31] brothers? God has a word concerning
[2:20:36] you. You remember the time you when you
[2:20:38] first
[2:20:40] believe. You remember the enthusiasm you
[2:20:43] had the faith you had and what you
[2:20:46] believed God can do in your
[2:20:48] life. God never changed his
[2:20:51] mind. You have felt many times as if God
[2:20:55] changed his mind. But God never changed
[2:20:58] his
[2:20:59] mind. Even if you feel different. By the
[2:21:03] way, you have to understand the gospel
[2:21:05] and
[2:21:07] faith. It's not about how you
[2:21:13] feel. It is quite
[2:21:15] absurd. How many you know in our
[2:21:19] generation have turned and reduced the
[2:21:21] gospel down to
[2:21:23] [Music]
[2:21:25] feelings. Now I believe in
[2:21:29] emotions get my point properly and get
[2:21:31] the best words to use. Listen listen are
[2:21:34] you listening church. The the gospel of
[2:21:38] Jesus Christ is not about how you feel.
[2:21:44] It is beyond how you
[2:21:47] feel. That's why we are
[2:21:49] [Music]
[2:21:51] believers. It's not about how we
[2:21:53] feel. Sometimes you will feel like a
[2:21:56] believer. Sometimes you will feel like
[2:21:58] an
[2:21:59] unbeliever. But if you are a believer,
[2:22:02] it doesn't matter what you
[2:22:04] feel because God is first
[2:22:08] opinion perfect
[2:22:11] about. And that opinion does not
[2:22:15] change. Okay, let me first come to your
[2:22:18] level right
[2:22:19] now. Your address. Let me tell you this.
[2:22:23] If you don't, if you want to understand
[2:22:25] this, ask yourself, how many of you
[2:22:30] since you believed Jesus
[2:22:31] Christ have lived spotless lives?
[2:22:39] No
[2:22:41] hand. So you have all lived a messed
[2:22:47] up. I thought when you believe
[2:22:49] Jesus, old things are passable. All
[2:22:52] things have become new. You are supposed
[2:22:53] to be
[2:22:54] spotless. That's not what it
[2:22:58] is. You're going to have a lot of
[2:23:01] spots, a lot of falling, a lot of
[2:23:04] rising, but
[2:23:07] throughout the entire
[2:23:09] process. God is
[2:23:11] mine about your
[2:23:14] life and do not
[2:23:16] change. Amen. Now that is why it is
[2:23:20] important for a believer to know what
[2:23:22] God says about
[2:23:27] him. That is why when you realize who
[2:23:30] you
[2:23:31] are, you when you get a revelation of
[2:23:34] who you are,
[2:23:36] Never fail. No amount of demons can
[2:23:39] destroy your
[2:23:41] life. Things will come and things
[2:23:43] will your feet will remain on the word
[2:23:46] of
[2:23:48] God. You will sing a song. I shall not
[2:23:51] be
[2:23:53] moved. Just like a tree planted by the
[2:23:55] [Applause]
[2:23:57] river, I shall not be moved.
[2:24:00] Satan had many
[2:24:02] plans when he was coming down to the
[2:24:04] human race. He said, "I will ascend
[2:24:07] above the
[2:24:09] stars and I'll become God." That was
[2:24:12] Sony's
[2:24:15] plan. Plan A. And he says, "If this
[2:24:19] fails, I will go down and take over the
[2:24:23] human
[2:24:25] race." That was his plan B.
[2:24:28] He says, "If I can't take over the human
[2:24:31] race, I will confuse the human
[2:24:34] race, I will rule over them." That was
[2:24:37] plan C. And plan B was if I cannot rule
[2:24:41] over
[2:24:42] them. I will steal from them. I will
[2:24:46] kill them and I will destroy the
[2:24:49] earth. Satan has had all this planned
[2:24:51] out.
[2:24:54] But you see, God always also has a
[2:24:58] plan. That's why in the book of Genesis,
[2:25:02] he created the the land, the sea, the
[2:25:07] fish, the things in the in the in the
[2:25:09] garden, and then he created man. He
[2:25:13] created the
[2:25:14] waters and then he created the fish. God
[2:25:18] always plans things before he does.
[2:25:22] God had a
[2:25:23] plan. I want you to turn to the book of
[2:25:28] Genesis, chapter
[2:25:30] 3, vers
[2:25:37] 15. I want you to see the plan of
[2:25:44] God. And I will put an enemy between
[2:25:46] thee and a woman, between thy seed and
[2:25:49] her seed. It shall bruise thy head, and
[2:25:51] thou shalt bruise his
[2:26:00] [Music]
[2:26:03] heel. Now friends, let me say this
[2:26:07] slowly. Many do not understand. Listen,
[2:26:10] listen. Many do not understand what
[2:26:12] happened in
[2:26:15] Genesis. And I want to just spend a
[2:26:17] moment to rehearse a little bit for you.
[2:26:21] Many people don't have the
[2:26:24] understanding of what happened in
[2:26:27] Genesis. They think that Adam ate an
[2:26:30] apple.
[2:26:32] And you know, but says something. It
[2:26:35] says if Eve ate an
[2:26:37] apple and she realized she was
[2:26:40] naked, then they should pass
[2:26:44] apples to the women of this
[2:26:47] generation so that they can
[2:26:52] dress. Many of them are walking half
[2:26:54] naked.
[2:26:57] So we should pass apples to
[2:26:59] them and then they realize they need
[2:27:02] it because if the apple could do that
[2:27:04] day do it
[2:27:07] today. But you have to understand it was
[2:27:10] not
[2:27:13] apple. What did they do? God told them
[2:27:17] of all the trees you can eat but of this
[2:27:20] tree the tree of knowledge of good and
[2:27:22] evil that you should not
[2:27:25] eat. But you see what Eve did. He added
[2:27:29] on the word when the serpent came. This
[2:27:33] serpent was a crawling
[2:27:37] creature. We think it was a crawling
[2:27:41] creature. But it was not a crawling
[2:27:44] creature. You're a good interpreter. It
[2:27:46] was not a crawling
[2:27:48] creature. It was an upright
[2:27:53] m. believers who have the revelation for
[2:27:55] this say
[2:27:57] amen. Praise the name of the Lord.
[2:28:00] Brother Shalom, can you please come up
[2:28:02] here? You
[2:28:04] see, God bless you, brother Shalom. See
[2:28:07] how handsome he looks. That's how the
[2:28:10] serpent
[2:28:14] looks. It is funny, but I'm not abusing
[2:28:17] you, brother,
[2:28:19] because it was a creature of God.
[2:28:23] It's not only him. Even
[2:28:25] you, it looked like all of
[2:28:30] us with hands, feet, with a stomach,
[2:28:36] with a back, with a head, with a mouth.
[2:28:40] The Bible even says she was
[2:28:41] eating and talking. Does a snake
[2:28:46] talk? It was talking.
[2:28:50] But
[2:28:51] then when it began talking to
[2:28:54] Eve, did God
[2:28:56] say eat of every tree? Eve said yes. God
[2:29:01] said we eat of every
[2:29:04] tree. He says we should not eat of the
[2:29:07] okay rather she said that God said we
[2:29:09] should not eat of of only the
[2:29:11] tree that is in the middle of the garden
[2:29:14] and we should not even touch
[2:29:16] it. So when she added on the
[2:29:20] word we should not touch it the serpent
[2:29:24] was
[2:29:25] happy. It was not the serpent by the
[2:29:29] way. This serpent was a
[2:29:32] creature which looked like a human
[2:29:35] being which could talk which could
[2:29:38] reason. The difference between the this
[2:29:41] creature and
[2:29:43] man was he did not have a soul.
[2:29:49] But man had a
[2:29:50] sword. That's the only
[2:29:53] difference. But this serpent also had a
[2:29:58] seed. In
[2:30:00] fact, it was not a snake. He called it a
[2:30:04] beast. It had a
[2:30:07] seed. Just like a man has a
[2:30:10] seat. Can I have one of my children run
[2:30:12] up
[2:30:14] here? Any come up. Come up.
[2:30:17] run right quick. Come and preach with me
[2:30:20] this morning.
[2:30:22] Oh, I saw you singing in Lugana. That
[2:30:24] was beautiful.
[2:30:26] Amen. This is my
[2:30:29] seed. I have a seed and this is the
[2:30:33] fruit. My seed. You get a point. I'm
[2:30:37] trying to say it in out in a better way
[2:30:39] for you to understand without cuz we are
[2:30:41] in mixed congregation here.
[2:30:45] So now the serpent
[2:30:47] also that seed was in
[2:30:50] me but now it is
[2:30:53] manifest but this serpent also had
[2:30:57] se that
[2:30:59] seed if mixed with with a w with a
[2:31:03] woman's egg or
[2:31:07] seed could bring
[2:31:09] forth
[2:31:11] child that is the ability
[2:31:14] that only
[2:31:17] beast. No other animal in the garden had
[2:31:20] that ability.
[2:31:54] Serpent is only a
[2:31:57] word used to mean the evil one, the
[2:32:02] devil. So he the cunning one. And the
[2:32:07] Bible says this
[2:32:11] serpent was very
[2:32:14] cunning, very
[2:32:16] subtle. It was the wisest of all the
[2:32:19] other
[2:32:20] beasts. And now the Bible
[2:32:23] says, you know, uh it was a
[2:32:26] beast, not a
[2:32:28] snake. I wish I had time read all
[2:32:31] all but right here in the book of
[2:32:34] Genesis. So you see here The red
[2:32:37] dragon was cast
[2:32:40] out. That old
[2:32:42] serpent called the devil and Satan
[2:32:46] deceiveth the whole world and was cast
[2:32:49] out into the earth and his angels were
[2:32:54] cast. Follow me closely. Follow me now.
[2:32:58] In the book of Ezekiel, I believe it is
[2:33:00] where he says, "Thou has been in Eden.
[2:33:06] the garden of
[2:33:07] God. And then he begins describing the
[2:33:11] devil, how he was in the garden of
[2:33:13] angels, how he was created by God, how
[2:33:16] he was an angel. So we notice
[2:33:20] here, and let me say this, I'm trying to
[2:33:22] say this slowly
[2:33:24] because understand what I'm saying. So
[2:33:27] there is a
[2:33:28] connection between the
[2:33:32] serpent in
[2:33:34] heaven and the serpent on
[2:33:37] earth. Are you following me? Are you
[2:33:40] following
[2:33:41] me? The word
[2:33:44] serpent is not necessarily meaning
[2:33:50] [Music]
[2:33:51] snake. All right. Okay. Right. Right
[2:33:54] over there. Thank you, brother.
[2:33:56] So see here in Ezekiel that has been in
[2:33:59] the
[2:34:00] garden everyone
[2:34:04] was
[2:34:06] [Music]
[2:34:08] diamond and
[2:34:10] gold the workmanship of thy tablets and
[2:34:13] of thy
[2:34:17] pipes that thou was
[2:34:19] clean. So he could sing. He could sing.
[2:34:24] beautiful voice. He was created. He was
[2:34:27] in the garden of God. Verse
[2:34:30] 14. You have verse
[2:34:33] 14.
[2:34:34] Ah, praise the name of the Lord. Thou
[2:34:38] art at the anointed
[2:34:40] cherub that
[2:34:42] coverth. And I have set thee
[2:34:45] so thou was upon the holy mountain.
[2:34:50] th has walked up and down in the midst
[2:34:52] of
[2:34:54] the So he was
[2:34:56] in but also he was in heaven.
[2:35:00] He's a
[2:35:02] carob. So who is he talking about here?
[2:35:05] And he calls him
[2:35:07] serpent in revelation. He's talking
[2:35:10] about
[2:35:11] Satan. He's talking about Satan as a
[2:35:15] serpent. He was an angel. He was a
[2:35:18] singer. He was a head musician. He's
[2:35:22] talking about
[2:35:23] Lucifer. Somewhere else he gives his
[2:35:25] name. He says Lucifer.
[2:35:28] [Music]
[2:35:29] He he was in heaven. His name was
[2:35:31] Lucifer.
[2:35:33] But he came down. He was cast out from
[2:35:36] heaven because of trying to lift
[2:35:39] himself above the stars of
[2:35:42] God. And he came down on earth in the
[2:35:45] Garden of Eden.
[2:35:48] Now, can you still help me, brother?
[2:35:51] Thank you. Now when he came down in the
[2:35:54] garden
[2:35:55] of there was this
[2:35:57] brother also called
[2:36:00] serpent. But this was not the
[2:36:04] devil. This was a
[2:36:06] creature in the garden of
[2:36:09] Eden looking like this
[2:36:12] man but having no
[2:36:14] problem like a
[2:36:17] chimpanzeee has no problem.
[2:36:20] is a creature of
[2:36:22] God. So was
[2:36:25] this beast
[2:36:27] or but this beast was the closest to the
[2:36:31] human
[2:36:33] race. Everything
[2:36:36] same. The only difference was it never
[2:36:39] had a
[2:36:40] soul. And then what happened when the
[2:36:44] old serpent came?
[2:36:47] He always loves beautiful
[2:36:51] things. That's why when those demons
[2:36:54] enter into
[2:36:55] people, they try to beautify
[2:36:59] themselves more than what God
[2:37:03] meant. Now, I'm not saying we should
[2:37:04] look
[2:37:05] ugly, but we can naturally look
[2:37:10] beautiful. You see when they when an
[2:37:13] evil spirit
[2:37:14] come they try they they try to tell you
[2:37:19] guys are not
[2:37:21] beautiful
[2:37:24] them make them look
[2:37:27] long I don't even know how they do they
[2:37:30] work and then you find a woman her nails
[2:37:33] are
[2:37:35] painted the devil is really giving them
[2:37:38] a lot of trouble
[2:37:41] And then on top of that you tell them
[2:37:45] even your lips are
[2:37:47] ugly. Paint
[2:37:50] them paint even these ears. They are not
[2:37:54] supposed to be like that. put something
[2:37:57] on
[2:38:01] them and the devil puts them on a
[2:38:07] burden and they will continue on even
[2:38:09] your face, even your eyes, even your
[2:38:12] nose and you know the devil will change
[2:38:15] them until recently. whom a man shoot a
[2:38:19] man a
[2:38:21] woman for lying to
[2:38:23] him because they went and had a wedding
[2:38:27] after they came
[2:38:29] out in the morning of their honeymoon
[2:38:33] day. The man saw somebody in
[2:38:37] bed and wanted to run
[2:38:39] away. What is
[2:38:41] this dear? I'm the
[2:38:44] one. You are not the one.
[2:38:48] I mean hair
[2:38:50] change, nails
[2:38:52] change, eyes
[2:38:55] change, mouth removed, nose, it was also
[2:39:00] fake, everything was
[2:39:02] fake, plastic
[2:39:05] surgery. Is the devil making them
[2:39:09] suffer? Says you're fearful and
[2:39:11] wonderful
[2:39:14] man. do not desire to get those
[2:39:19] add-ons. You can look beautiful
[2:39:24] naturally. If you're naturally dark
[2:39:27] skin, brother, sister, that's beautiful
[2:39:31] in the sight
[2:39:33] of by the way if you are dark and you
[2:39:35] make yourself brown or whatever, you
[2:39:37] will look
[2:39:40] ugly. Hallelujah. Patience stand up.
[2:39:44] patience naturally dark. Look at
[2:39:48] her. Turn to the people. I'm sorry for
[2:39:51] putting you. I'm sorry. But she's not
[2:39:55] beautiful. You find a girl like this.
[2:39:58] God bless you.
[2:40:01] See, the devil deceiving. But we thank
[2:40:04] God for
[2:40:05] this. He has given us
[2:40:09] eyes to see. There are still people in
[2:40:12] this
[2:40:13] world who are happy the way God made
[2:40:18] her. Amen. Amen. If you're a black
[2:40:22] woman, you're a black woman, a black man
[2:40:25] for
[2:40:26] God, if you're short, if you're tall,
[2:40:30] brother, that's all
[2:40:32] right. That's how
[2:40:34] God. But we see this beast was there. It
[2:40:39] was beautiful.
[2:40:42] And then the devil saw that he saw the
[2:40:44] intellect in her that this one will help
[2:40:47] me accomplish my goal. And you remember
[2:40:50] Satan was a
[2:40:52] spirit. So he
[2:40:55] came. Don't tell me that's not true. We
[2:40:59] have seen it in the
[2:41:00] Bible. The devil has done it before. He
[2:41:04] did it at at
[2:41:05] Gada. He entered into pigs.
[2:41:09] It is something he has specialized in
[2:41:12] doing. Even today we always cast out
[2:41:15] demons. How do they enter them? Have you
[2:41:18] ever asked yourself how do demons enter
[2:41:22] human
[2:41:23] being? Because they forced
[2:41:26] themselves. They forced themselves
[2:41:30] there. You know, as long as the p they
[2:41:32] get a
[2:41:34] place, the Bible says when demons are
[2:41:36] cast out of a man,
[2:41:38] They go in dry
[2:41:40] places but you see they keep coming back
[2:41:43] to
[2:41:44] shape. How is my house? If it's empty,
[2:41:49] sorry, but stay
[2:41:50] in. If the house is empty, then they
[2:41:53] will come in and they will call their
[2:41:56] brothers and
[2:41:57] sisters. So you find a person more demon
[2:42:01] possessed than they were before they
[2:42:03] left
[2:42:05] church. They are in church and they are
[2:42:09] bad bad but not
[2:42:11] bad but very bad and when they backslide
[2:42:16] the demons you will find they are
[2:42:18] worse because the demons will come and
[2:42:21] bring their
[2:42:25] grandchildren and they will enter them.
[2:42:28] But you see the devil enters people the
[2:42:31] army of the
[2:42:32] Lord is commissioned to cast out devil
[2:42:37] Amen. And the best way I
[2:42:39] know that casts out demons is the
[2:42:45] word. Yes, sir. And so there was Mr.
[2:42:50] Serpent. A good creature in the
[2:42:53] garden. I don't know what it was doing.
[2:42:55] Then a serpent from
[2:42:59] heaven came into
[2:43:02] it.
[2:43:05] M what's happening? I'm seeing things
[2:43:10] different then started walking then you
[2:43:14] can go back
[2:43:15] my because you a son of
[2:43:17] God you're not a
[2:43:19] serpent then you see began
[2:43:24] walking
[2:43:27] and she looks
[2:43:32] different she looks
[2:43:34] different she's
[2:43:36] Beautiful. How come I've never seen her
[2:43:38] like
[2:43:40] that? What is it? Something entered
[2:43:45] into it is the eyes of a
[2:43:47] serpent but they
[2:43:51] influence the body of a serpent but is
[2:43:57] influenced. The mouth of a serpent but
[2:44:00] is influent. One time a demon entered
[2:44:03] Peter and Peter started speaking to
[2:44:07] Jesus, discouraging him to
[2:44:10] die. Jesus realized this is not Peter,
[2:44:14] it's a
[2:44:17] demon. He went
[2:44:19] out and now here it has entered this
[2:44:22] beast and no one was there to cast it
[2:44:27] out. When it came to Eve,
[2:44:31] Eve
[2:44:33] cooperated and the moment she
[2:44:37] accepted the devil
[2:44:41] proposed that was the
[2:44:46] sin. Understand me correctly. The
[2:44:48] original
[2:44:50] sin
[2:44:53] unbelief. When God gave the
[2:44:57] word, Adam believed it. Adam gave it to
[2:45:00] you. But when the woman heard the
[2:45:02] serpent of this
[2:45:04] word, then she believed the
[2:45:07] serpent. That was the
[2:45:09] sin. That was the original
[2:45:11] sin. Follow me close. You have to
[2:45:15] understand this part because it will it
[2:45:18] will open up the whole thing.
[2:45:21] You have to understand that when that
[2:45:25] happened, he believed the
[2:45:28] serpent. But the serpent was not on its
[2:45:32] own. The devil was in this house. I want
[2:45:36] you to remember. This was a tree of
[2:45:40] knowledge, good and evil. It was not a a
[2:45:44] physical
[2:45:46] tree. He was talking about the devil.
[2:45:49] And when the woman was
[2:45:51] hearing, she was eating of the
[2:45:54] tree and she accepted to take the fruit
[2:45:57] of
[2:45:58] it. Praise the name of the Lord. Oh,
[2:46:01] this is figurative
[2:46:03] [Applause]
[2:46:04] language. But what does it mean? You
[2:46:07] know, she accepted to partake of the
[2:46:11] truth by believing the false
[2:46:14] doctrine and she ended up in a doubt.
[2:46:18] Now that part is what the theologians
[2:46:21] don't
[2:46:24] understand. I had a prophet who has come
[2:46:26] and told
[2:46:27] me actually saw what happened in the
[2:46:32] garden of Eden. You tell me how
[2:46:35] possible who wrote the book
[2:46:38] of who that was
[2:46:43] there. Brother Emma can you imagine
[2:46:48] In the
[2:46:49] beginning, God who was
[2:46:52] there to tell us everything
[2:46:54] how he
[2:46:56] said, "Who was
[2:46:59] there?" It had to be a
[2:47:03] prophet and it was
[2:47:06] Moses. Moses
[2:47:08] saw what was there. He wasn't there, but
[2:47:12] he saw it and wrote it down. So
[2:47:16] William, he goes back to the same
[2:47:20] place in the same way Moses went
[2:47:23] there. He saw
[2:47:27] details of actually what
[2:47:30] happened and he came back and he
[2:47:33] explained how the serpent walked over to
[2:47:37] Eve and he explains it was not a
[2:47:41] snake. It was an upperate creature.
[2:47:46] How is he able to
[2:47:47] explain? He saw it. This the same man
[2:47:52] who was able to tell people their names,
[2:47:53] their
[2:47:55] address, what is wrong with them? What
[2:47:58] is the inside of them without even
[2:48:01] knowing? By what
[2:48:03] ability? Prophetic
[2:48:08] sight. And so you saw the thing. And he
[2:48:11] comes back and he says, "So the serpent
[2:48:14] had a
[2:48:15] seed, and the seed mingled with the seed
[2:48:18] of a
[2:48:19] woman. And then there comes out a child.
[2:48:23] And the child is
[2:48:26] cave." And then after he says that,
[2:48:29] everybody shocked how possible. You take
[2:48:33] your Bible, you will see it is a Bible
[2:48:35] doctrine.
[2:48:38] The Bible says Enoch was the seventh
[2:48:39] from
[2:48:41] Adam. And when you
[2:48:44] count is not there because he
[2:48:47] died. says
[2:48:50] replaced from Adam. It goes straight to
[2:48:54] stress and yet Cain
[2:48:57] lives and Kane had
[2:48:59] children. So tell me what happened why
[2:49:03] is Cain not in the
[2:49:07] genealogy
[2:49:10] because never a son of
[2:49:13] Adam. And in the book of first
[2:49:16] John, the Bible say love one another and
[2:49:20] it says not as not as Cain.
[2:49:25] Who was of that wicked
[2:49:27] one? Kane was of who? Of that wicked
[2:49:31] one. Kane was a son of the wicked
[2:49:34] one. Who is the wicked one? The wicked
[2:49:37] one was Satan.
[2:49:40] Now after sin
[2:49:41] happened, the devil thought he will
[2:49:44] corrupt
[2:49:47] mankind. The devil thought he will
[2:49:50] corrupt the human race. So when God came
[2:49:53] down, he said, "What have you done?" And
[2:49:56] Adam said, "It's not me. It's the woman
[2:49:59] you and the woman said, it's not me,
[2:50:02] it's the serpent." Now, I want you to
[2:50:05] see here now. Can you open your eyes?
[2:50:09] When God when a woman says the
[2:50:12] serpent, God turns the serpent, he
[2:50:15] doesn't even ask the
[2:50:18] serpent because
[2:50:20] animals do not have power over
[2:50:27] choice. That
[2:50:29] animal could not stop the serpent
[2:50:36] coming. But
[2:50:39] nevertheless, because of this
[2:50:42] serpent, God had to destroy
[2:50:45] it, all these
[2:50:47] abilities for it never to happen
[2:50:51] again. And he said, "Because of what you
[2:50:53] have
[2:50:54] done, you will
[2:50:57] crown on your
[2:51:00] belly." That was not the case
[2:51:05] before. you will eat the
[2:51:07] dust which means it was not eating the
[2:51:09] dust at all.
[2:51:12] So you see now and then eventually he
[2:51:15] goes on to to to to the woman I said
[2:51:18] because of what you have done in pain
[2:51:22] you'll bring
[2:51:23] forth and that is the same thing
[2:51:26] today and the serpent still
[2:51:31] crawling
[2:51:35] ring the
[2:51:37] snake it was not in the original
[2:51:39] creation
[2:51:42] [Music]
[2:51:44] It came as a result of
[2:51:48] cast. Isn't it amazing?
[2:51:53] But I want you to see
[2:51:55] here because you have done
[2:51:58] this. He is speaking to the to the to
[2:52:02] the um
[2:52:04] serpent. You are cast above all.
[2:52:08] You are cast above every beast of the
[2:52:11] field. Upon thy belly thou shalt thou
[2:52:13] shalt
[2:52:14] go, and thou shalt thou eat all the days
[2:52:16] of
[2:52:17] thy and I will put enity between
[2:52:21] thee and the woman and between thy seed
[2:52:25] and her seed. So the serpent had a
[2:52:30] seed and God said, I'll put a limit
[2:52:33] between your seed and her seed.
[2:52:38] So the woman also would have a
[2:52:41] seat. What is this woman's seed?
[2:52:45] Are you following me, church? What is a
[2:52:47] woman
[2:52:48] seed? Anybody knows what a woman
[2:52:51] is? The woman's seed would be a child
[2:52:54] that is born without a
[2:52:59] [Music]
[2:53:01] man born by a
[2:53:03] woman. That is only one in the whole
[2:53:07] world that has ever been born without a
[2:53:11] man born by a woman and that is
[2:53:15] Jesus. So Jesus is the woman's
[2:53:19] seed. Now right here in the
[2:53:22] beginning, in the beginning of all
[2:53:25] things, God had a
[2:53:27] plan. God
[2:53:29] prophesied that a woman will have a
[2:53:33] seat. So that was sometimes when God
[2:53:35] speaks
[2:53:36] words. You think they are
[2:53:39] idol. You think they have no power. Let
[2:53:42] me tell you church, the word of God has
[2:53:44] power.
[2:53:46] Even now as I'm
[2:53:48] speaking, even now as I'm
[2:53:50] speaking, you may not feel it. Something
[2:53:53] I am I know and I'm
[2:53:55] sure something is being
[2:53:59] created. Why? Because the word of
[2:54:02] God has power. When God said there will
[2:54:06] be a woman
[2:54:07] in he was talking about his
[2:54:10] plan. His plan was a
[2:54:13] perfect even as God is
[2:54:16] perfect and he therefore has a winning
[2:54:19] plan
[2:54:21] also. No angel knew the
[2:54:24] plan. No man knew the plan. Can I say
[2:54:28] his plan was a top secret
[2:54:33] plan that God himself would be according
[2:54:37] to man.
[2:54:42] to
[2:54:43] uproot and to
[2:54:45] destroy the seed of
[2:54:48] Satan. Hallelujah. The devil thought he
[2:54:51] had won and he seed come into the human
[2:54:55] race. By the way, after the
[2:54:59] flood, we cannot know which race is
[2:55:02] certainly
[2:55:07] seed. Everything was mixed up.
[2:55:10] So we cannot know but we can know by one
[2:55:14] way the seed of
[2:55:16] God believe the
[2:55:18] word the seed
[2:55:20] of never
[2:55:24] believe that's why God himself had to
[2:55:28] come as the word whoever believes in him
[2:55:33] the seed of God whoever does not believe
[2:55:35] in him the seed
[2:55:38] Am I preaching to someone this morning?
[2:55:41] And then Jesus stood before the
[2:55:43] disciples. And the Pharisees and he told
[2:55:46] the Pharisees,
[2:55:47] "You are of your father, the
[2:55:52] devil." How can you call us of
[2:55:54] our we descendants of
[2:55:57] the Abraham was our father? He said,
[2:56:00] "No, if he was, he would have believed
[2:56:04] me. And because you have rejected me,
[2:56:07] your father is the
[2:56:09] devil. Even today, I can say if you know
[2:56:13] the
[2:56:14] word, reject the word, God is not your
[2:56:18] father. Go and look for your
[2:56:22] father. But I am preaching to a people
[2:56:25] here that know that God is their
[2:56:28] father. They love the word of
[2:56:31] God. They live the word.
[2:56:34] in the
[2:56:36] church
[2:56:37] any more than anything more than a
[2:56:44] boyfriend. God is more than
[2:56:48] anything. That means God is your
[2:56:52] father and you say God is my
[2:56:56] father. Hallelujah. So God had a
[2:57:00] plan to ruin the seed of s
[2:57:05] And his plan was alpha and omega plan.
[2:57:13] You know God is amazing. So his plan was
[2:57:17] alpha and omega plan. Alpha omega plan
[2:57:19] top
[2:57:21] secret. When the angel saw the devil
[2:57:28] attacking, people have asked this
[2:57:30] question many times.
[2:57:32] If God is
[2:57:33] loving when he saw Satan going to
[2:57:36] attack, why didn't he quickly and stop
[2:57:41] Satan? Do you have the same
[2:57:44] question? He didn't have
[2:57:46] to because he had a
[2:57:49] plan.
[2:57:51] Sometimes his plan things look like they
[2:57:54] are
[2:57:56] failing. If you are in a situation which
[2:57:59] looks like things are failing,
[2:58:01] God has a
[2:58:03] plan. Hallelujah. Because he likes to
[2:58:07] surprise the devil.
[2:58:11] If he works on you very
[2:58:13] quickly before things go
[2:58:15] bad, where will he get the glory
[2:58:18] from? But he wants your
[2:58:23] enemies. Let them talk. After they have
[2:58:27] spoken, he has the final word.
[2:58:32] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Amen. When when you
[2:58:34] know Job was in a situation
[2:58:37] crying and
[2:58:39] everything friends came and I began
[2:58:42] talking to you. Oh, you are a sinner.
[2:58:45] Maybe you
[2:58:49] s are you sure you have been living
[2:58:51] right?
[2:58:53] But you know in all the
[2:58:55] situation cried, Job pray to God. Job
[2:59:00] even was angered and he asked God why
[2:59:04] you he went through it
[2:59:07] all and then after all had
[2:59:12] spoken then
[2:59:15] prophet Hallelujah. Amen. Prophet
[2:59:19] came he said my
[2:59:22] friends you are all you have all spoken
[2:59:24] your
[2:59:25] words can you also permit me to
[2:59:28] speak for I am here to speak for
[2:59:32] God preachers speak on behalf of
[2:59:37] God when you believe them you're
[2:59:39] believing
[2:59:41] God and when he spoke his word was the
[2:59:45] final
[2:59:47] God has the final
[2:59:49] word. I don't want you to look at your
[2:59:52] situations. God has the final
[2:59:54] word. His
[2:59:57] plan alpha and
[2:59:59] omega means beginning and
[3:00:02] end. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Yes, sir.
[3:00:06] He was right there at your beginning and
[3:00:10] he's going to be right there at your
[3:00:12] end. You know, he says to you, he says
[3:00:16] to me, "Trust me. I've got
[3:00:19] [Music]
[3:00:21] this. He has a plan. Tell your neighbor,
[3:00:24] God has a
[3:00:26] plan." Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you
[3:00:30] know, they must have wanted to go, all
[3:00:31] the
[3:00:33] angels, let me go and save the day. Oh
[3:00:37] God, let me go. But God had a plan. And
[3:00:41] he told all the
[3:00:42] angels, all of you
[3:00:44] angels, step
[3:00:46] aside. Amen. Step aside. And you know
[3:00:49] those moments when it looks like Satan
[3:00:52] is
[3:00:53] winning. Amen. You know, you feel like
[3:00:55] Satan is
[3:00:56] winning all the angels. You can't feel
[3:00:59] them. You can't feel the presence
[3:01:02] of I want to say to you
[3:01:05] today has a
[3:01:07] plan. Amen. Amen. God's plan is always a
[3:01:13] win. Hold my brother. Hold. Stand
[3:01:17] still. I want to say stand
[3:01:22] still because we serve a living
[3:01:26] God. God who never
[3:01:29] fail. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Praise
[3:01:33] God. A God who never fails. He has a
[3:01:37] plan for my life. Run for
[3:01:41] your
[3:01:47] life. You want to buy a
[3:01:51] house. You want to go to school. He has
[3:01:54] a plan. You want to get married. He has
[3:01:57] a plan. He has a
[3:02:00] plan.
[3:02:02] Winning. If you trust him, he cannot
[3:02:06] disappoint.
[3:02:07] Let us learn to trust in
[3:02:11] him. Stand still and see the salvation
[3:02:14] of our
[3:02:16] Lord.
[3:02:18] Amen. All angels stopped them. He said
[3:02:23] wait was like baby go sweep the
[3:02:28] devil with floods says
[3:02:33] wait you know me whatever you send me to
[3:02:36] do I do
[3:02:40] say oh master let me send the good
[3:02:44] news and tell Adam and Eve you are
[3:02:48] coming
[3:02:49] down said no with a surprise visit I
[3:02:53] want to
[3:02:56] make.
[3:02:58] Amen. Alpha and Omega
[3:03:03] plan. Then we find when God found them
[3:03:07] standing behind a bush
[3:03:09] somewhere shivering with their fig
[3:03:13] leaves approns
[3:03:14] on. They always try to get to Geneva and
[3:03:17] have a citizen people try and have a
[3:03:23] conference to make you know something
[3:03:27] inspiring. So also God wanted to have a
[3:03:31] conference with his people make certain
[3:03:35] places and they call a conference
[3:03:38] together. But I guess
[3:03:40] God found Adam and
[3:03:43] Eve behind a bush over there. They
[3:03:47] couldn't come out. They said, "We can't
[3:03:49] come out, father. We are
[3:03:52] naked." And who told you you were naked?
[3:03:56] God looked around and he found a
[3:03:58] tree, a certain place, a place he
[3:04:02] thought would be
[3:04:04] beautiful. And he got some
[3:04:07] skins and he threw them back in the
[3:04:11] bushes. And he said, "Adam, if cover
[3:04:15] yourselves with this, come out before
[3:04:17] me." And they had a
[3:04:20] conference. They talked it over with
[3:04:22] God.
[3:04:24] God made a preparation
[3:04:26] for and I'm so glad there was an aiden
[3:04:32] conference because there was
[3:04:35] an is a conference
[3:04:40] today. Not let us go under the fig
[3:04:43] leaves and something we can show up
[3:04:46] [Applause]
[3:04:48] together. But God killed something to
[3:04:50] cover their
[3:04:51] sin. And he gave a promise that through
[3:04:55] the woman is
[3:04:59] seash telling what he himself would do
[3:05:01] for
[3:05:03] them. I'm so glad of the Aiden
[3:05:08] conference. He made a way of a way
[3:05:15] to he could come back again.
[3:05:20] be brought back into
[3:05:22] fellowship where he would lo be lost and
[3:05:24] standing out somewhere and done without
[3:05:31] God. He made a
[3:05:33] preparation at the Eden
[3:05:36] conference
[3:05:38] temporality until the real preparation
[3:05:41] would be given through the
[3:05:45] sacrificial. He spoke that it would do
[3:05:48] that. But between that
[3:05:51] time the lamb had to
[3:05:54] die until the
[3:05:57] time until the lamp. Now now listen when
[3:06:01] he came down he gave them courts of
[3:06:05] skin. That was a
[3:06:07] preparation for the what? The work he
[3:06:09] will do to the sacrificial
[3:06:13] lamb blood of him of himself.
[3:06:16] But between that
[3:06:19] time and the time he would fulfill the
[3:06:22] real
[3:06:24] thing, he told them that they should
[3:06:26] be killing the
[3:06:31] lambs and then until that
[3:06:34] time that God himself would
[3:06:37] come and breathe the serpent his
[3:06:41] head and his he will be bruised at
[3:06:44] Calvary.
[3:06:47] And that conference was
[3:06:49] success. It will beat Satan
[3:06:54] anywhere. God is what. Jesus was God's
[3:06:57] word. And he will beat Satan in any
[3:07:00] condition, any time, any place,
[3:07:05] [Music]
[3:07:06] anywhere. Friends, I want you to listen
[3:07:08] to this
[3:07:09] prayer. Amen. You know when you're
[3:07:12] reading a wheel, it's like I'm reading a
[3:07:13] wheel now.
[3:07:15] Eden was only a type of a
[3:07:18] greater. The devil must have laughed at
[3:07:21] what
[3:07:23] happened. He didn't know this was just
[3:07:25] the
[3:07:26] beginning to think that God would just
[3:07:28] kill some sheep and clothe
[3:07:33] Adam. This looks stupid to
[3:07:37] the devil must have sat
[3:07:39] there and was like, "Ah,
[3:07:44] That's the best you can
[3:07:46] do. Does he know what I've done? I've
[3:07:50] planted my seed in
[3:07:51] there. He doesn't know. It's all
[3:07:56] right. I've planted my seed in there.
[3:08:00] And the best he can do is to dress them
[3:08:03] with some bloody ship
[3:08:06] skin. Wait until my plan
[3:08:10] manifest. What was the devil seeing?
[3:08:13] He was seeing his
[3:08:15] seed killing the seed of
[3:08:17] God. Pain
[3:08:20] killing. Did God know? God knew. Did God
[3:08:25] do
[3:08:25] anything? No.
[3:08:29] Apparently, but God had a
[3:08:31] plan. So the devil was shaking his
[3:08:34] head. I know. Wait until my son
[3:08:39] grows. And this woman had twins.
[3:08:43] in the same
[3:08:45] womb. One son of Adam, one son of the
[3:08:49] son and gave birth to them both on the
[3:08:53] same day. Kane and Abel was not was a
[3:08:57] son of God. Kane was a son of
[3:09:01] God. He was
[3:09:03] Rudy. He he was a
[3:09:06] bushman. He did not have any mercy. He
[3:09:09] went to his brother, quizzed his
[3:09:12] man because God rejected his
[3:09:15] calling. His offering was without
[3:09:19] revelation. Kane offered, you know what?
[3:09:21] Kane offered apples. Because he thought
[3:09:25] God, you know, his father and mother,
[3:09:29] they ate apples. So he offered
[3:09:32] apples. God refused it. But Abel knew by
[3:09:37] revelation it was
[3:09:40] blood offered a lamb a blood
[3:09:44] lamb. The true church will have the true
[3:09:49] revelation. Hallelujah. Amen. And so
[3:09:52] right there in
[3:09:54] Aiden we see it was just the beginning.
[3:09:59] The devil thought he had
[3:10:01] won. It looked stupid what God had done.
[3:10:06] But someone right there should have told
[3:10:08] the devil. Satan, it's just the
[3:10:13] beginning. It's just the
[3:10:15] beginning. When you feel you are
[3:10:18] defeated, you need to learn to man
[3:10:22] up and
[3:10:24] say, "It's just the beginning."
[3:10:27] When you're
[3:10:28] bleeding, when you are in a serious
[3:10:32] issue, you tell
[3:10:34] Satan just the
[3:10:38] beginning. God is
[3:10:40] really already doing
[3:10:43] something in my
[3:10:46] life.
[3:10:47] Brother Julius,
[3:10:50] tell Satan, it's just the
[3:10:52] beginning. I've not lost anything. It's
[3:10:55] just the beginning.
[3:10:57] It's just the beginning. Hallelujah.
[3:10:59] Hallelujah. How many here are going
[3:11:01] through
[3:11:03] something? Tell the devil it's just the
[3:11:06] beginning. Sister, that's what you can
[3:11:08] tell him. It's just the
[3:11:12] beginning. But many times we begin
[3:11:16] crying.
[3:11:18] [Applause]
[3:11:20] God doesn't like people who
[3:11:22] cry out of
[3:11:25] fear. Moses came and was crying. Oh,
[3:11:32] God. God told
[3:11:35] him, "Stop it.
[3:11:40] Become Hallelujah. There is something
[3:11:43] I'm trying to get
[3:11:45] you. Is in you.
[3:11:50] He doesn't expect you to
[3:11:52] cry. He expects you to
[3:11:55] speak when things not to speak when
[3:11:58] things are
[3:12:00] good, but speak when things are going
[3:12:04] south. Speak when your back is against
[3:12:06] the
[3:12:07] wall. I want you to know is just the
[3:12:10] beginning. God is already doing
[3:12:12] something.
[3:12:14] Every condition must
[3:12:16] bow. It doesn't matter what is poverty,
[3:12:20] sickness. Every body
[3:12:26] condition sometimes. Let me tell you,
[3:12:30] brother. Even when sin hits you
[3:12:33] down, learn to
[3:12:38] resist. You young
[3:12:40] men, learn to resist.
[3:12:43] until the
[3:12:45] devil he sees you and you see it that
[3:12:48] you are
[3:12:57] going and you're
[3:13:03] down to see what I'm going to
[3:13:07] do because you know who you are. You
[3:13:10] know who you are. You know who you are.
[3:13:13] Nothing puts you
[3:13:16] down. Yes, sir.
[3:13:18] Now, the plan was getting ready to be
[3:13:24] executed. Hallelujah. Amen. We are now
[3:13:27] about to
[3:13:29] land. We have been
[3:13:31] building. Now, I want us to
[3:13:34] land. God had a
[3:13:36] plan. And we've known the plan. It's a
[3:13:40] bit mysterious.
[3:13:42] But the plan is about to be
[3:13:45] executed. It ends up with you. By the
[3:13:49] way, Luke 1 verse
[3:13:52] 28. How many years
[3:13:54] after? I don't know. Thousands of
[3:13:58] years. And the angel came in unto
[3:14:02] her and said,
[3:14:05] "Hail, thou that highly favored
[3:14:11] The Lord is with thee.
[3:14:14] [Music]
[3:14:15] Blessed art thou among
[3:14:18] women. Hallelujah.
[3:14:21] Hallelujah. Okay. In Eden, God did not
[3:14:24] send an
[3:14:25] angel. But now he's sending an
[3:14:28] angel. Thousands of years
[3:14:30] later, Satan is almost controlling the
[3:14:33] world. And Satan thinks he's the is the
[3:14:36] Lord.
[3:14:38] You remember when he told Jesus, "The
[3:14:41] word belongs to me. Just bow to me and I
[3:14:43] give it to you." He thought he was
[3:14:46] there. I want to say Jesus is
[3:14:49] Lord. Southern is not
[3:14:52] Lord. Jesus is Lord. But thousands of
[3:14:56] years
[3:14:57] later, when it was time for God to now
[3:15:00] execute this
[3:15:03] plan, who was the first to know?
[3:15:08] Mary. Miam. Who was the first to hear?
[3:15:13] Mary. Who was the first to know that the
[3:15:16] plan was being
[3:15:19] destroyed?
[3:15:20] Eve. Who was the first to know that
[3:15:23] about God's
[3:15:25] plan? Mary. Fear
[3:15:30] women. Women are a blessing.
[3:15:38] A man there sentiment I'm going to say
[3:15:41] right here a man without a
[3:15:45] woman cannot it let me put it this way
[3:15:48] it will be very
[3:15:50] difficult for him to
[3:15:53] realize his true godgiven
[3:15:58] ambition and execute all of
[3:16:01] them but when a man has a
[3:16:05] woman in his life. I'm not talking about
[3:16:08] a prostitute, a wayward
[3:16:10] woman. I'm talking about a woman of
[3:16:13] virtue. You realize that men tend to be
[3:16:19] clearheaded. Elizabeth, it was her that
[3:16:22] God spoke
[3:16:23] to. When he tried to speak to the man,
[3:16:26] it did not go well. So, if you don't
[3:16:29] have a
[3:16:31] mother, have a wife.
[3:16:34] You don't have a wife. Hey my brother,
[3:16:38] pray so
[3:16:42] hard. But I tell you all men who have
[3:16:45] become something in this
[3:16:47] life. They will always say I thank God
[3:16:49] for my
[3:16:52] mother. God will use a
[3:16:55] woman because the devil know the
[3:16:58] sick. That's why he came to a woman.
[3:17:06] Whatever you give to a
[3:17:09] woman. So if you give her a good
[3:17:13] thing, she multiplies it and gives you a
[3:17:16] better
[3:17:17] thing. Hallelujah. But if you give her
[3:17:23] hell, she will give you hell
[3:17:29] fire. You brothers who are
[3:17:32] married, you need to cherish those
[3:17:36] women. A woman that is a woman of
[3:17:39] virtue. Let me tell you something. She
[3:17:42] is the second best
[3:17:45] gift from
[3:17:47] salvation. Salvation is number
[3:17:52] one. Not your
[3:17:55] church father.
[3:17:58] Nothing in this
[3:18:00] life, not even your job, but you are
[3:18:05] woman. Oh my my my can the brothers who
[3:18:09] are
[3:18:12] married. Brothers who are married have a
[3:18:17] problem. Can I hear your
[3:18:22] amen? God bless you,
[3:18:25] brother. women, they are a
[3:18:29] blessing. They have a connection with
[3:18:32] God. God deals with them so
[3:18:36] easily. And in the same way, Satan loves
[3:18:40] them. One woman like this destroy the
[3:18:44] whole
[3:18:45] world. Women have
[3:18:48] power if they yield to an
[3:18:52] authority. That's why sister never yield
[3:18:55] to wrong
[3:18:57] authority, never yield to wrong
[3:19:00] spirits. One woman like this who yielded
[3:19:03] to the
[3:19:05] devil many men to
[3:19:10] hell, preachers to
[3:19:14] heaven. That's how it is. A woman, you
[3:19:18] must be very careful to know what are
[3:19:21] you submitting to.
[3:19:23] Are you submitting to the word? Even
[3:19:26] when you accepting a man to
[3:19:28] marry, don't accept
[3:19:30] everybody. A man who is submitted to
[3:19:36] God. Amen. The first one to
[3:19:39] know about the plan of
[3:19:42] God, not the
[3:19:44] pastors, not the priests, not the big
[3:19:47] men, the church
[3:19:49] people, the little woman. God
[3:19:55] Mary, the angel of God, the general in
[3:20:00] heaven. Oh my sister called
[3:20:04] Gabriel with all his
[3:20:07] glory. When he came down, he did not go
[3:20:10] to any
[3:20:11] man. He did not go to any priest. He did
[3:20:14] not go to the king. He go to the high
[3:20:17] priest. He came to little old Mary.
[3:20:22] a little
[3:20:23] teenager and he came to her and saluted
[3:20:27] her and said, "Hail
[3:20:33] Mary." Now you need to know why was Mary
[3:20:37] favor. Mary was in a place for
[3:20:43] privilege where a great
[3:20:47] mystery that have been
[3:20:49] hidden for
[3:20:53] ages was going to be revealed for the
[3:20:57] very first
[3:20:58] time to
[3:21:00] her. My sisters, you are in a better
[3:21:04] place. My sisters, you are in a place of
[3:21:07] deliverance.
[3:21:08] my
[3:21:09] sister to the Holy Ghost. God will use
[3:21:13] you in a much better
[3:21:15] way and he will use
[3:21:20] 10,000. I know we preach women are not
[3:21:23] supposed to
[3:21:25] teach. If God is frustrating
[3:21:28] you, if God is frustrating
[3:21:32] you, God has a better
[3:21:35] plan. He can't tell you
[3:21:37] when you can't preach if he has nothing
[3:21:41] better for
[3:21:42] you. He has something
[3:21:46] [Applause]
[3:21:48] better. Come
[3:22:00] on. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Can I begin?
[3:22:04] Can I begin? A woman brings forth
[3:22:07] life. A woman stands as a as a strength
[3:22:10] to the
[3:22:11] man. A woman builds the society. A woman
[3:22:15] strengthens the church. A woman is a
[3:22:17] type of
[3:22:19] family. What are you talking about?
[3:22:21] Everything
[3:22:22] powerful in the
[3:22:27] world. Yes sir. That's why the devil
[3:22:30] knows it.
[3:22:32] try to to to pollute the
[3:22:37] women and make the plan of God
[3:22:42] obscure. But brother, sister, let me
[3:22:45] tell you, a woman that is yielded to
[3:22:50] God has great enormous
[3:22:54] power in her
[3:22:56] hands
[3:22:58] in Let me say this. I feel to say
[3:23:01] this under the anointing while you
[3:23:04] sisters that are
[3:23:05] married. Oh my. I'm saying this
[3:23:08] anointing
[3:23:10] now. Listen to you sisters who are
[3:23:13] married. Sisters all you here that are
[3:23:16] married. This is the word of the Lord
[3:23:18] for
[3:23:18] you. You have
[3:23:21] power. You have enormous
[3:23:24] strength to make that man whatever you
[3:23:26] want him to be.
[3:23:29] As long as you are led by the Holy
[3:23:33] Ghost. Amen. If you want him to change
[3:23:36] career, he can.
[3:23:41] I'm not crazy. I know what I'm talking
[3:23:44] about. If you want him to get a better
[3:23:46] job, he
[3:23:49] can. If you want 10 children, he can
[3:23:51] give them to
[3:23:55] you. Do you know what I'm talking about?
[3:23:58] And I'm saying this by
[3:24:01] inspiration. Why? God has given you and
[3:24:04] you alone that
[3:24:06] power. But you do not know how to wield
[3:24:10] it. Your man is a drunkard. You want him
[3:24:13] to stop. He can
[3:24:16] stop. Your man is a
[3:24:18] womanizer. You want him to stop. Come
[3:24:20] on. The power is with
[3:24:22] you. But how are you going to use it?
[3:24:26] The problem you women, you use your
[3:24:27] power in a wrong
[3:24:31] way. The moment you go to your
[3:24:34] husband and you begin lecturing
[3:24:42] him, you have wasted your
[3:24:47] authority. Remember, humble
[3:24:50] yourself. Submit yourself to your
[3:24:53] mind. And what will come next? Go on
[3:24:56] your
[3:24:57] knees. Pray for him. Every prayer you
[3:25:01] pray will do it. God will do it. You
[3:25:06] don't have to go to
[3:25:07] witchcraft. Go on your knees. If your
[3:25:10] man is a
[3:25:15] drunk, you wait and see. You will
[3:25:19] control him.
[3:25:21] [Music]
[3:25:24] But the
[3:25:25] problem the women of this
[3:25:28] generation they use their own
[3:25:40] mouth
[3:25:43] me brings out the lion that
[3:25:47] he who are you talking to sister you
[3:25:50] have lost
[3:25:54] But if you are
[3:25:56] able to
[3:26:00] brother my husband told me I can't come
[3:26:04] to
[3:26:05] church he's a
[3:26:07] drunkard
[3:26:12] man but pastors these days don't worry
[3:26:16] sister leave that man I'll give you
[3:26:19] another one
[3:26:22] They are all they are they are blind
[3:26:24] leaders of the blind leading the
[3:26:28] blind. But a prophet of this generation
[3:26:32] prophet told this
[3:26:35] woman you meant to be in
[3:26:38] church your
[3:26:40] heart your husband stay at
[3:26:45] home and be the best of a Christian you
[3:26:48] can ever be.
[3:26:53] live the life before
[3:26:56] him to
[3:26:58] him and then you will soon realize what
[3:27:02] God will do about 6 months
[3:27:05] later was water baptized in
[3:27:07] [Music]
[3:27:10] church power of a woman is in
[3:27:14] submission fight for the feeble
[3:27:18] God fights for the
[3:27:20] weak. Never raise your voice at your
[3:27:24] heart. That's a woman of
[3:27:28] bank. Humble yourself. Speak gentle as a
[3:27:33] woman. Remember, he is your
[3:27:37] Lord. You're not
[3:27:40] equals. I'm sorry. I don't care how you
[3:27:42] feel.
[3:27:45] says called her
[3:27:48] husband and that's what we preach and we
[3:27:52] believe in
[3:27:54] all over the world and a woman that does
[3:27:57] that and knows her place then you're
[3:28:00] going to watch the kind of power that
[3:28:03] you will if you use
[3:28:06] it what's the power submission number
[3:28:10] one number two
[3:28:14] that has power that you
[3:28:15] don't I've realized many times my wife
[3:28:18] speaks to me over
[3:28:21] time and and I also
[3:28:25] reason and later later on I see myself
[3:28:29] doing
[3:28:30] what she wanted me to
[3:28:33] do and then she says I
[3:28:37] know when she says that I know what she
[3:28:43] She pressed the
[3:28:44] remote. She prayed.
[3:28:49] Praise the name of the Lord. I think I'm
[3:28:52] not going to finish this
[3:28:56] sermon. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. When we
[3:28:59] come back on
[3:29:01] Wednesday, I'm going to take you
[3:29:03] through the execution of the
[3:29:07] plan. And I now stopped prematurely.
[3:29:13] But if I continue, I'll take you for one
[3:29:16] more
[3:29:17] hour. God bless you for that. Stand on
[3:29:20] your
[3:29:21] [Music]
[3:29:23] feet.
[3:29:26] Hallelujah. There's too much to
[3:29:29] say. And I realize you always have too
[3:29:31] little
[3:29:35] time. Try to always come in midweek
[3:29:37] services.
[3:29:41] God has more for you.
[3:29:44] [Music]
[3:29:45] Amen.
[3:29:47] Can I have the song leader come and help
[3:29:49] us worship in a few songs?
[3:30:10] And this is a question. Somebody just
[3:30:12] asked a question right
[3:30:13] here. If the serpent never had a
[3:30:18] soul, how come the serpent seed has a
[3:30:21] soul?
[3:30:25] Because the serpent
[3:30:27] seed is not only from the
[3:30:32] serpent is from the mixture of
[3:30:36] humanankind it's taken through the seed
[3:30:38] of
[3:30:41] [Music]
[3:30:45] humankind whatever goes through like
[3:30:47] Jesus I mean whatever goes through uh
[3:30:51] humankind is 100% %
[3:30:54] human. Just like Jesus, I was supposed
[3:30:57] to get there but I did
[3:30:59] not. Just like Jesus was 100%
[3:31:03] God, but also 100%
[3:31:07] man cuz he went through the
[3:31:11] man. Praise
[3:31:13] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I have a
[3:31:16] father. Can you help me sing that lead
[3:31:19] that brother? Where's brother Amram? Can

[3:48:14] [Music]
[3:48:17] Let's first pray before we continue.
[3:48:20] Uh if you have any need that you have
[3:48:22] come with
[3:48:24] me, I'd like you to believe that God is
[3:48:28] here and is a rewarder of those who
[3:48:31] diligently seek
[3:48:34] him. Allow
[3:48:36] him to minister to you. After you have
[3:48:39] heard the preacher
[3:48:41] preach, the Holy Spirit comes down,
[3:48:43] ministers to
[3:48:44] you and convicts
[3:48:47] you in your heart. Lord
[3:48:50] Jesus, I'd like to come before you, oh
[3:48:55] God. To pray for your people,
[3:48:58] Lord. You know the needs whatsoever they
[3:49:00] have in their
[3:49:02] heart. Lord, I believe you've spoken to
[3:49:04] us.
[3:49:06] You reminded us of the impossibilities
[3:49:08] with
[3:49:11] you. You reminded us of your grace and
[3:49:13] of your love and of your
[3:49:15] power. You are the same yesterday,
[3:49:17] today, and forever.
[3:49:19] Lord, Father, Lord, you came
[3:49:22] down and when Adam and
[3:49:26] Eve was against the
[3:49:28] wall, Lord, you closed them. Lord, even
[3:49:32] though the enemy thought it was all
[3:49:34] over,
[3:49:36] Yet you had a plan for them. I know you
[3:49:38] have a plan for your
[3:49:40] children. You have a plan for each one
[3:49:42] of us. Father, no matter what situations
[3:49:45] we might be going through, no matter
[3:49:47] what hardship we might be facing, you
[3:49:50] have a plan for us. Lord, may we go away
[3:49:52] from this place with this assurance in
[3:49:55] our
[3:49:56] hearts. God has got it
[3:49:58] all. is in charge of this ship and he
[3:50:02] will seal us through. Father, we love
[3:50:05] you and I commit each one of you into
[3:50:06] your
[3:50:07] hands. They go to start this week, Lord.
[3:50:10] May you give them strength. May you give
[3:50:12] them grace and may you give them
[3:50:15] provision, Lord, to be able to go
[3:50:17] through it, Lord, in the name of Jesus
[3:50:20] Christ.
[3:50:22] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We're going to
[3:50:23] continue worshiping maybe for just a few
[3:50:26] moments.
[3:50:27] [Music]
[3:50:29] I'll invite a song leader to do
[3:50:31] that. You feel tired, you will go,
[3:50:36] but I just want us to just worship a
[3:50:37] little bit.
[3:50:40] But before we do
[3:50:42] that, we would love uh there's a text
[3:50:45] here. Would love to thank God for his
[3:50:46] goodness upon our
[3:50:48] family. He finally answered our
[3:50:51] prayers and gave us a
[3:50:54] car we had been praying for.
[3:50:58] Amen. That's the
[3:51:01] family. We pray that
[3:51:03] uh anybody who has the same
[3:51:07] need is a faithful
[3:51:11] God.
[3:51:12] Amen. Praise God. Mother, can you come
[3:51:16] and lead us in a few songs? The service
[3:51:17] is really dismissed. If you want to go,
[3:51:19] we'll just sing a few a few songs and
[3:51:21] we'll be here once again on Wednesday at
[3:51:23] uh 6 p.m. God bless you.
