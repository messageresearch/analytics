watch and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he's so old and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking after that he put his eyes he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and he saw every man clearly makko your own interpretation of your wife it shall be a blessing to us jesus name we pray you may be seated in the presence uh you people are falling victims of my life you will not go unrewarded you want to go unrewarded especially i thank him so much for giving me this opportunity they took the blind man that jesus jesus took the blind man yes by hand and led him outside of the tower i want us to compare that with [Music] praise the lord amen he could not deal with us while we still in the world we were blind in the world in sin the king of this world had blinded us one by one take you by hand and lead you outside of the world now praise the lord man when he let you outside of the world see praise the lord man he brought you to salvation that was the first touch that he gave you because we were blind we were under the masses of jesus and it took obedience for us to obey we have not obeyed that we are not accepted to follow christ christ will not have anything to do with you and me why because he cannot deal with you in the world pick you out of the world and then now let's think like this second close the vertices if that blind man oh my god whom jesus led uh outside of the town yes because he was not seeing jesus in the first place because you think jesus would have opened his eyes yes praise the lord amen if he had insisted not to god see again if he had lost trust for jesus christ jesus was a wrong character yes praise the lord amen this calls for obedience he recalls for obedience christ demands for obedience from you on youtube the things of god are not understood using intellectual understanding you cannot discover the purpose of god in your life if they may things may not make sense in the beginning you may not understand the way things are going on in your life now but i'm here to tell you my sister my brothers one day things will make sense one day you will understand why things are going on in your life the way they happen i am telling you don't seek for answers for why things are happening in your life that way i mean do not look for answers for why things are happening in your life in the world one thing you must find out jordan is that are you in the will of god are you worshiping jesus oh you're worshiping riches oh and the bible tells us that when jesus led this man inside the outside of fire streets walking never abandoning anything it means he was not saying clearly now come to think of it if this man had saved from a second cigar now that at least i can see directly i have never when he caught when he laid his hands on him he asked him that do you see now he said i see men as trees of jesus he knew this man was not actually seeing well what will praise the lord and that is the way we saw when we just came to salvation praise [Applause] praise the lord amen where back in the world everyone said when you were in the denominational world you would sit it means you were feeding on worms that's not eagle's food that's not the food of all eaglets you try to eat the worms but you could not get satisfied with it you knew something was wrong somewhere oh man you are the world where you're about to anyhow you could not help yourself you didn't know what to do again you didn't know which path to take how many you covered oh my you were blind god had a provided way but you did how much you are blind yes you said no i don't see that voice but i can't hear it i feel i belong to that voice praise the lord and you walked by faith you came out of the catholic no fire you came out of that process protestant church you came out of the ph and you walked anyhow no america you didn't know where you were going you didn't know where you were going but inside of you you were walking praise the lord amen he brought you in jesus hallelujah why don't we thank god this evening has opened your eyes why don't you thank god that is praise the lord amen and when you heard this word the very first time you heard it your heart agreed with it you did not ask questions they were you didn't doubt in your heart in your heart you knew this is home momentum amen that was the spirit of the lord jesus christ it was a blessing to you it opened your eyes back okay you were in the denomination you were living in lies and yet you thought you were serving the lord you tried your best to please him and then somehow you could not do it to your business why because the flesh was still calling right praise the lord amen the bible says lay aside everything that easily be said your nature and run your race with patience it is not because you are better than them no by a single it is not because you are worthy for anything good no since your granny day children it is by the grace of god brother says you are here by the grace of god you want to write such a controversy that's because he had compassion on you he had mercy on you then he picked you out of a million days of all those people that were out there brother and troubled he decided to grab your heart ourselves you tell us the meaning of the paradigm jesus said amen i want to tell you this there are people who are predestinated i want you to accept that that they are those people that he knew even before the foundation of the world i know that [Music] we came to this particular [Music] he saw this man was blind he didn't know that was god he never needed that pool anymore he needed god now charity of healing he never needed water again you that was his turning point and we are choking god gave him that touch and he went home rejoicing praise the lord why did he abandon all those people and he came to pick this particular man amen if your heart agrees with this truth oh my god if your heart has accepted you to believe this message that is the proof that my brother my sister he touched you yeah if anything you don't have the ability to believe this word that is why the denominations will speak anything about it i think you've gone crazy why because they cannot believe the word praise the lord you don't need someone to convince you to believe the word is the word of god praise the lord amen what matters is that god understands you i am jesus promised yes that we are going to tuck it down your nose praise the lord i mean you are on that solid ground hallelujah jesus asked peter yesterday people say that near you they gave very many answers of the lord it is not flesh and blood who is in heaven let me tell you of agreeing with every single judge from this world you know what the world says the bible says he's coming for a church without spot or wrinkle every church that has eaten the word if there's still a spot in you god somehow does not agree with the certainty i want to tell you my brother my sister get to the monastery get to the honors bench [Music] disagreeing with other things don't wait for next week during the weekend don't wait for after easter the time is now praise the lord amen this is the time for you to get right with god now is the time church for you to pave your way why am i saying this watching number one i am telling you i don't know why preachers are preaching the heart goes for nowadays one thing i know god is preparing his church praise the lord what will happen to you sister church if you've not your life is of more value than the food problem praise with god wait wait are you telling me brother problem gave a testimony of a certain man who under the holy spirit you wanted to be killed he got so desperate he got so desperate that he needed another touch he said i can't do without it oh look what he did he left his home he left the glamour he left the fancy building he went to the garden and he knelt down enough he cried praise that he cried he told god if you don't feel me what does it do if you don't feel me i am going to die here he said if you don't feel me you will find my bones here today you will come back you're going to find my bones that is what god wants that is what god demands he wants you to get this parent yes he wants you to get tested to prove to him [Applause] i want he was helpless i want to i can't help all these habits tell him i need you i'm tired of lasting after women i'm tired of being selfish i'm tired of hating my brother and sister i'm tired of this wicked life he wants praise the lord let this blind man look took him by hand and led him outside now if this man had rejected this i am sure he would let him go praise the lord amen because christ is not an author of confusion the song says his eyes his hands are wide open i am saying you may qualify to be a christian it is about living a transformed life it is about being a converted person it is about taking a step of faith it's about leaving one spot and going to another open house it's about abandoning bible he wants it is not a trial and error praise the lord come here it is not gambling it is not giving it a try praise the lord we are more than conquerors jesus he says come back you've gone astray you've wandered away from him far from him and he's been bleeding he has never stopped he's still pleading even up to now you may be the reason why i've come out so i want [Applause] praise praise the lord you didn't come here on your own you had a first touch praise the lord remember it is more than that jesus christ you need a second time good demons it is not you went through the water you came and confessed your sins afraid you went to the water the back of jesus you got the baptism nobody's the one from the water but i'm asking you are you convinced is it settled in your hearts that you now have him praise the lord remember if you have him you will know germany if you don't have him you will also know i [Music] even though marina praise the lord come back to me are you convinced my devil that god is in here if he's not there you will know we'll get you together if he's there brother hang on [Music] he is reminding i don't want to when jesus came to the temple i found them doing business he didn't sit down and smile no praise the lord come here when he came and got sinners in the house he didn't sit down and pump at them i will wash my hands that becomes the identity do you have the identity if you don't have look for the identity look for him now now now now while he can still be powered between darkness and life praise the lord what have you given your life to oblivion have you given your life to the darkness you will also know the bible says but we shall preach satanic resist jesus it's a war you have to fight for your life you've got to resist the devil but you know jesus started the good news is that no he promised us yet that he shall flee from that [Music] praise [Music] why because he [Music] what is that complication in your life that he never pleased god but when david you know before god your status is nothing praise the lord i mean you know you've got to leave a converted life if something is not right what i'm going to tell you if i know that i am not right i will they may tell me you may not be able to see what i'm saying as for me i am confused that i can see why because right i am seeing men ask me praise the lord i am telling you no amount of words can convince me to tell you people may judge me [Music] if you can we've got to know phenomena that we need another time we need him to meet our god for us this world is so complicated the world is all messed up that without another one you can do anything praise the lord look at you're worshiping god let me tell you one thing there are people everywhere that are opening churches every one of them has got a misinterpreted scripture that they are standing naturally that is stick and begin working okay you're going to mold the image and begin watching since you're going to buy a coat and you wash it okay and you'll do it with all reverence fully convinced in your heart that you're worshiping we i imagine when you're going to pray look into service tell god yourself go and open up yourself to god where is the catholic you cannot save him because before you mention it he knows why don't you save yourself we he will praise the lord do not be deceived before don't deceive yourself that you are okay because i'm telling you you are not praise the lord do not be deceived the worry man that you are worthy i want to tell you you are not going to be praise the lord accept to plead the guilt it isn't good you are looking for the reward because you know he will fill you when you plead guilty and because [Music] the way you want you cannot sing about you praise the lord come here it just
