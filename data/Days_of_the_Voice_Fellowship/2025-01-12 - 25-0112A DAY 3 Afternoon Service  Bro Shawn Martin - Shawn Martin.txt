you of course there's another one I think is sleeping well he's over there you can see God bless you one more thing but can do that while we are standing I just want us to change the order of the service the brothers gave me this report since this is we usually do it's like a custom that we do every every week we are trying to collect funds for our church land I said what are we going to do how are we going to get the we going to ask ourselves and we divided the church into seven groups each group collects money every week and in some of those groups Believers from other Church even join and so we compete like that and then we announce a weekly amount since we did not have our church Sunday Serv me to read one person may want to be a part of this so we have seven groups um and the first one is called Paul this week they collect 14,000 the second group is Iranians they collected 50,000 third group is Martin they collected 40,000 it is usually more but because I think everybody has been busy has been number one theyve done 3,000 johnley johnley William and so this week uh all the seven groups have raised 745 and in 49 weeks we have collected 53 million and currently we have 80 million shs we are looking for about [Music] 220 butor Manda while you are preaching I Reeder God bless you Sean I'm sorry for taking the time but the people are ready and you can preach for as long as the amen are you ready for the word it's our last day we are not going to have fire because we do not want to limit the word in the evening we just want to have a good clim amen can we sing a song that song the brother requested [Music] no to Fe I [Music] am God [Music] I am I am [Music] child [Music] no oh I am I am a [Music] child oh Lord [Music] I am child [Music] child sing it [Music] again my child oh I'm [Music] no am child God sing the last lines oh I [Music] am sing it once again oh I am a child do you believe that oh yes I am a child I am a child of God amen amen isn't it good to know that you're a child of the Lord amen amen and um it's hard to believe that we're uh at the last uh day of the [Music] meeting I uh want to just say it's just been an honor to be here with you [Music] all we have certainly enjoyed the services and appreciate the uh hospitality and we have uh I've enjoyed the food and I was uh hoping that when I come up this way I would lose some weight I don't think that so we'll have to find another way but uh we uh we appreciate uh uh the the cooking appreciate the musicians appreciate the um uh the interpretation amen praise the Lord and uh it's just always good to be around God's people uh before we go into the word may we just bow our heads and talk to the Lord you know in in this day that we're living in we we need him and uh we certainly need him uh today this afternoon and if you have any need um present it before the Lord amen and as we pray father lord it's it's just been good to to be with your people and Lord we know that you care for them you showed that you cared because you gave your own blood Lord for them and as the prophet said if I had two drops of blood in a charger in a cup how precious it would be and how careful he would be uh uh to handle it but then he said he got to thinking how standing before him and I believe standing before me today is something greater than your blood it's your people father for you gave your blood for them and Lord I pray that you would just come in a special way that you would meet every need Lord father may your anointing just be here not only anoint me but anoint The Interpreter brother here anoint your people we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ and the church says amen and amen if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Isaiah the 43rd chapter and uh we want to just say we appreciate brother Josh driving us back and forth to the hotel I think this morning all of us ministers voted for him to be the best driver in this part of Africa we certainly appreciate him amen appreciate uh Pastor here and opening his Pulpit to us and let us uh speak uh to the church amen and appreciate his hospitality and everything that he's done for us amen uh the book of Isaiah the 43rd chapter and um let's see the 18th verse we'll start there but it says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold I will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall not uh shall ye not know it I will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert the Beast of the field shall honor me the dragons and the owls because I give water in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people My Chosen amen this people have I formed for myself and they shall show forth my praise amen amen [Music] mayang [Music] amen amen you can have your seats praise the Lord so here we we see that God speaking through the proph prophet Isaiah he promises to do a something new and as we have stated before uh and know that any promise of God must come to pass as the message has taught us that God has lotted his word to each age and he predestinated a a certain people to that age to manifest that word and we are we are a blessed people to be able to look back and see what word was allotted for the age amen and and to see that the people that were uh uh predestinated to fulfill uh the word for that age but we are more blessed to know our age to know the age that we live and to know the word that has been predestinated for us and not only to know the word that's been predestinated to this age but to know we've been predestinated to that word can you say Amen so then we've got a purpose we're not just floating around we're not just accepting anything and and I I believe that this scripture that uh we we read I believe it's very applicable for our age I believe that we're living in an age that God is doing something new amen now I I looked this word new it means having recently come into existence being something other than the former or old so if it's new it's not old it's not part of the old the thing that has been it's not this that is new can you say Amen so 2 Corinthians 5 17 it says therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature or we could say a new creation and notice old things are passed away because the new has come the old has passed away you can't have the new and the old at the same time can you say so he become a new creation and old things are passed away behold all things somebody say all things are become new so you don't have to deal with the old you don't have to be identified with the old anymore when God saved you when he filled you with the Holy Ghost you don't have to deal with with the old the old habits are gone the old desires are gone the old Nature has passed away can you say Amen now the Bible also tells us in Revelations 21 And1 John said I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth in other words the old Heaven the old Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John also saw the holy city knew Jerusalem see the old have passed away and the new is come in and this New Jerusalem joha coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband and if you notice in the fifth verse John says he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new can you say Amen Church were going to some place new a city that's new a world that's new no more sickness no more pain no more suffering no more diseases no more mind battles no more devil to deal with it's everything is new can you say man this life is nothing but corruption this Mortal life is is uh uh full of demonic powers amen but we're going someplace new and he says and the former things will not be remembered the old things will not be remembered can you say amen I want to say to you God doesn't want you dwelling on the old God doesn't want you dwelling on your path God doesn't want you dwelling on your failures God doesn't want you dwelling on the things that he delivered you from can you say Amen if if something brings your past up to you that's the devil that ain't God Amen if there's thoughts in your mind that remind you of where you used to be that's the devil because on that something that brings up your failures that's the devil bringing that can you say Amen yes sir amen so see the old way the old life the old condition the old creation will be done away with amen the Bible says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old can you amen now if you notice what God Said in our opening scripture is people have I formed for myself in other words God's going to do a new thing with this people can you say Amen he's not only going to make you new everything about you is going to be new your future is going to be new life is new you're coming to New thoughts can you say amen that's right see amen see so this people is the new creation that is in Jesus there was a mixed multitude that went with us amen there was make Believers unbelievers and Believers ain't that right amen and so along the journey we we find that there was murmuring there was uh grumbling there was uh unbelief and and and and to think of it even though God performed the supernatural now listen now he fed them supernaturally he ca Mana to come from Heaven amen he fed them by a rock amen and it wasn't just a trickle of water coming down it was a gusher of water coming out of a rock can you say man listen it had to it had to water two and a half million people and plus all their livestock ain't that right they had the angel of the Lord with them they had an atonement with him they had the pillar of fire with him they had a prophet with him and yet they didn't know what God was doing amen and they complained they grumbled they grabbed they was looking for a new way when Dayan and cor cor rose up they didn't have the Miracles at Moses they didn't have the supernatural signs that a prophet had and yet because they didn't believe in the prophet and believe in his message they went the way of Kora can you say amen that's right see and so we find that that any time that trouble came their way they were filled with unbelief and they said we want to go back we had it better in the old dayses we had it better in slavery why did you bring us out here to die because they didn't know that God was taking them to somewhere new can you say man you see in the land of Egypt they weren't the Conqueror in the land of Egypt they had no inheritance in the land of Egypt amen all they were they they they had to do amen what the Egyptians wanted them to do that God was taking them to a land to where they would be the Overcomers to where they would have Victory to where they could claim their rights see so he was leading them now brother brandham called uh uh uh the ones that were grumbling he called them old Fighters amen old Fighters see they just wouldn't accept the leadership of God through a prophetic Ministry I want to make it clear old fighter doesn't mean a person in old age can you say man so we don't want to look at the elders as old Fighters amen I'll tell you what an old figh is an old fighter is one that is stuck in the in the way of traditions he's stuck in the way of the past an old fighter is one that is is fighting against the progress that God is trying to bring to his people can you say man an old fighter is trying to take the people somewhere sales other than what a prophet was trying to take them to so they take the prophet's message and distort it to the others so as to get them away from the real thing so we find that when Israel came up to the land of promise Moses had sent 10 spies to spy out the land there in numbers 13 and 17 it says that Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan and said unto them get you up this way Southward and go up into the mountain see the land what it is and the people that dwelleth therein where whether they be strong or weak few or many and what the land is that they dwell in whether it be good or bad what cities they be that dwell in whether in tents or in strongholds now you think of that God's already told him what is in that land he already told them all the promises that is in that land but now God wanted them to to see for themselves and give a report so the Bible says they saw the promised land and everything that Moses said was true they saw the promise there but they saw the Giants in the land they saw the world cities they saw every obstacle that they would face in that land so notice what kind of report they came back with they said we came unto the land with thou sentest and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless in other words but the people be strong that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anak there the Al amales and and well a lot of the enemy was in the land and the 31st verse it says but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go against them people for they are stronger than we they forgot the promise they forgot the reality of the land that God had promised them see and so they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature and there we saw the Giants sons of anoch which come of the Giants and notice what they said we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so were we in their sight see they didn't see themselves as conquerors they didn't see themselves as the Seed of Abraham they didn't see themselves as the promised children of God they saw themselves as weak they saw themselves as unable they saw that the enemy was greater than them therefore they said we can't do it and you know what God let them wander around the Wilderness until they died off can you say am man that we find that later on God raised up Joshua with the ministry to take the people over into the land and not only take them over but he positionally placed them in the land you see Joshua had been given a revelation of the mystery where the people belonged in the land and by Revelation he would take them people and place them in the land he didn't look at and say well Caleb you're a little stronger than this guy so I'm going to put you where you're more able to defeat the enemy it didn't matter because God gave them the land and even the weakest Jew or Israelites could take their land and the enemy couldn't do nothing about it can you say amen amen but notice the people that he took over it was a new generation it was a new people the old had died out all the grumbling had died out all the naysayers had died out those that have tried to resist the prophet's message died out those that wouldn't catch the vision died out and God raised up a new generation to take the people over can you say amen hallelujah amen see God doesn't want you to keep looking back don't keep looking back if you come out of the world don't look back into the world if you come out of denominations don't look back in that denomination can you say Amen denominational teaching doesn't belong in this message come on church that's exactly right say he so those who had still had the old ways in them had to die out and God raised up a new generation now Church we've been brought to the promised land has brought us up to the promised land brother Andrew talked about the vision that brother brandham had of walking on the map of Palestine and brother Bram tells us of the vision he said it looked like I was standing on the P map of Palestine and I was coming down to the Jordan seemed like I could hear the song I'm going down to the Jordan someone was singing it and as I drew near the river he said I looked back and I seen which way I had come and I was 2/3 of the way first and second pull two3 of the way there to Jordan and he turned around and he looked to Cross Jordan he said oh praise God just on the other side is where all the promises lay the promises don't lay in the first pool promises don't lay in the second pole the promise lays in that third pole then you say amen amen he had come up to that Jordan River and he says there's where all the promises are he said every promise lays in the promised land can you say amen amen now I want to tell you where I I just believe the the prophet taught us is that on the other side in other words is where the thoughts of God were to come into reality because A promise is the word and a word is a thought expressed and God had thoughts in his mind as we have been saying amen and now God was now going to bring the people over not to reflect denomination not to reflect the old ways of the world but to come into the thoughts of God you see the prophet said the third pool is the opening of the word and this is God's thoughts in seed four can you say Amen God's plan is all right here God's purpose is all right here in seat form yes sir SE so the the the uh the other side I believe is the opening of the word in other words see in other words the book wasn't closed on the other side amen had a lot of things on this side of the river a lot of revivals a lot of things that that uh uh people a lot of emotions amen but God wasn't satisfied with us just saying in the Motions God wasn't just satisfied with us just uh uh having Pentecostal ideas denominational ideas or or whatever God was going to take us into the promised land to where the word is can you say Amen see no more guessing no more wondering whether I'm a Son of God or a daughter of God it's right here in the word and it's opening up no more wondering if Rapture is for me no more wondering if Heaven is for me no more wanding anymore can you say man no more wondering if God loves me no more wondering if I'm able to overcome no war wandering Where I Belong I'm not just a Christian floating around can you say man no more confusion as what really belongs to me the book is open on the other side the third pool is on the other side see it's the land of promise can you say amen I can look at set this way over there is a new way of looking at the word of God we've had a lot of theologians give us their own interpretation of the word of God we've had a lot of doctors of divinity we've had a lot of ministers come through and give us their own interpretation of the word of God can you say Amen that God would take a people into a new way of looking at the word of God I don't know about you I was raised up in the Pentecostal I didn't know how to place the Bible I thought a lot of the scriptures applied in in history I thought the things that Paul talked about was was was about his death amen and preachers didn't know how to place the word of God can you say Amen so it brought a lot of confusion hello church amen see we could not look at this Bible as the promises we knew that God promised to heal that could he do it for me we knew that he that that he he talked about sons of God but what about me can you say Amen we know there's going to be a Rapture but we couldn't Place ourselves in that Rapture see so then we found find amen that because of that third pool Ministry we find that it's the authority of the word of God how many believes that the third pool Ministry is the authority of the word of God we've heard it had it right was granted the salvation of her boys the dead fish that had been floating on the water for 30 minutes or so was brought back to life by the spoken word of God the snowstorm amen snowstorm amen was brought out of existence by the spoken word of God can you say amen amen what was it it was the manifestation of the third pool it was a man was on the earth that had an authority had an authority over creation had an authority over a loss Soul had an authority by the spoken word of God you see the third pool is a word of creation amen hallelujah can you say amen amen let me repeat it for them amen amen so the third pull is the word of creation remember now the same God in the beginning that spoke his word and brought forth the world out of nothing that same word was spoken on Earth not in Jesus day in this day and a man with the spoken word created squirrels brought squirrels into istence it wasn't Jesus Christ standing in a Corporal body or his Corporal body but it was Christ in a redeemed a new creation can you say Amen so that same God that said let there be life and the power of that word brought forth light was now speaking what was it it was the evidence of the land to show us what lay on the other side can you say Amen now listen they brought evidence back to show the people the promises and we find out God showed us an Evidence of what that third pool is it's no longer wishing to be it's an authority to be it's no longer wishing the mountain to move hallelujah hallelujah it isn't just wishing for victory it's now having authority to claim victory to possess your Mountain say amen amen but but but notice now brother brandham talked about them squirrels of being uh uh created he said did you notice that was sovereignly given he said I never asked him Lord let me do this speak these things in like that do these things there he said I never asked him that he by his own Divine will came to and said you go do this Hallelujah he said I wasn't asking one thing about it he said Moses never asked to go down in Egypt but God sent him down to amen it ain't making it on our own it's not saying a bunch of words it's coming under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost can you say Amen see so we find the authority came by the inspiration of God to speak it now notice the prophet said the new group was some Fighters I'm not looking at a bunch of Fighters today can you say amen I I I'm not looking at a bunch of unbelievers I'm not looking at a people that's resisting this message I'm looking at a people who desire to go into the promises I'm looking at a group of people that's Longing To Be partakers and manifest the thoughts of God sir see not Fighters he he let all the old Fighters die off and when the old Fighters died off he took their sons raised up among them Joshua and sent them over to the full PR did not God raise up a prophet Among Us and the angel of the Lord showed brother brandham that his ministry was a Joshua Ministry we're not looking for a Joshua Ministry to come we're not looking for an eighth day messenger we're not looking for a man with the new revelation there's no one that has a new revelation that can take us over God raised up a prophet in this age I ain't going to believe just that rhetoric that comes along by some Minister I'm going to stand upon the message of this hour I'll tell you this God didn't waste his time by sending us Malachi 4 and I ain't wasting my time by believing the message of Malachi amen can you say Amen this message has been Vindicated I'm not standing here wondering what the prophet was I'm not wondering how important his message was I say that's the Joshua I must follow God sent him to take me over into the land of PR we've had a lot of revivals we've had I think what brother brandham called proactive meetings people get worked up people roll on the floor I've seen them do flipflops around the floor but when the meetings over the people's back to where they are all that preaching all that singing all that running around it didn't help them they were still in a defeated situation they were still in the glooms and doom they were still talking defeat they were still saying oh God give us Revival give us Revival give us Revival but a prophet came and told us we are that Revival the Revival is the Awakening of this bride amen amen if you want to be established in the message if you want to be established in God believe this message if you want to come into the realities of the promise believe the message if you want to come into the reality he had the spoken word the message see Joshua sent them over to the promise that's what this message is God said a prophet could take us over into the full promise that's why we say every promise in the book is mine chapter every verse every last amen I'm not standing on this side looking over wonder what belongs to me the message has positionally placed me in the wordo [Applause] amen he sent him over into the full promise so what he done is he sent him over into the open of the word this new generation saw the Giants same Giants that the old saw the new generation saw the same old world cities at the old but they never let that man be magnified before them they knew they were children of the promise amen they knew that every giant would fall at their [Music] feet they didn't have to get worked up come on Church they didn't have to seek for something else they didn't need a new messenger they believed in the message that was given to them and by that message that giant look like a grasshopper In Their Eyes by the message they saw them W cities fall at their feet before it ever happen well do you love him see the Promise belonged to them our brother talked about it today the Book of Revelation theth chapter there was a book that been sealed up with Seven Seals ain't that right now John was caught up over in the Lord's day I'm just going to tell you it was our day the prophet showed that it was our day that he was caught up in and he's looking at the closed book one that sat upon the throne had a book in his hand sealed with Seven Seals and there was a voice that said who is worth to open and to loose the seals thereof and John said I looked around but nobody was wor there was no man wor Abraham wasn't found wor Moses wasn't found wor David wasn't found word Enoch wasn't found words there was no man on Earth No Angel was found worth and John said I began to weep I mean he weep because the brother Bram said the reason why he weeped is because if the book wasn't open all creation would be lost you realize this church if the book wasn't open your faith would be in vain if the book wasn't open this meeting would be in vain if the book wasn't open your confession would be in vain if if somebody didn't open this book see this book was the title deed of can you say amen amen man once had it but he forfeit it and it went back to the hands of the original owner amen and because man didn't have it man Liv it man was a victim man was was a sinner oh can you say amen he was without hope we needed the Redemption book of redemption to be open and as John began to weep there was a voice that said weep not John John this is not the time to we amen there was going to be something scenery was going to change the condition was going to change the atmosphere of weeping was going to change can you say Amen we not John Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah have prevailed he prevailed for you he prevailed for me he prevailed over your sickness over your sin over your failure prevailed over everything that Satan had to offer can you say amen amen amen but notice the Bible says and there stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that set upon the throne and when he had taken the book notice how the scenery changes now the atmosphere the four beast and 24 Elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them and golden vows full ofers which are the prayers of the Saints and they sung a new song not a song of Doom and Gloom not the song of traditions not traditional singing come on church this was not just a traditional church service not on that day they sang a new song The Lamb was able to take the old song the way can you say Amen notice now they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy now I want to tell you Church the days of of of um personalities were over the days of man building his own kingdom was over on Earth the days of man being able to glorify himself for before the people was over there they sang a new song th art worth this was not man worship this was the worship of the Lamb the prophet said King L worship and I'll just tell you brother Braham said it's time for King lamb worship now can you say amen for thou was slain and has redeemed us to God if you notice they're singing with the knowledge now they're singing with an understanding now they Ain sing and learn about their problems they're not worshiping worrying about their failures they're now singing a new song with the Revelation thou H has redeemed us back to God thou H has by thy blood has made us Kings and Priests Hallelujah I think that's the order of the day it that we' quit coming to church worrying about things we would quit coming to church with their head down we would quit coming to church exalting a man and we would just give all the glory to God because I am now a king and I am a priest by th blood Thou made me [Music] and we shall reain on the earth now John was looking at this but all of a sudden he come into it too you know the prophet said John was the type of this last day bride now you got to understand that John was not a type of the first church age he was not a type of the first second third fourth fifth sixth Church Chas he was a type of you and when John saw the book open he said all of Heaven heard me all creation in the earth the earth everyone that had an ear heard I Job saying blessing glory honor to the lamb can you say Amen his worship was directed to the lamb because the book had become open no more crying no more weeping no more threaten no more woring about his future hallu he now knew he was redeemed now the prophet said why did he why did John get emotional why did he shout why he said John must have saw his name on the bir hallelujah hallelujah amen no other age has this book become open no other age has this been an opening book but now that we have come to the Jordan River God is ready to do a new thing and when he got ready to do a new thing he wasn't going to bring us to another church age he wasn't going to bring us to another denominational age he wasn't just going to bring us to another ProTrac of Revival he was going to bring us into the promised land can you say Amen the open book now I can't say or not I don't know but it occurred to me I was driving down the road one time I think about that where brother Brown said John must have saw his name and I just got to thinking now did he just see it the first page everything was blank I don't know I just tend to think that John saw his name on every page every promise every promise in the book I just happen to believe John saw his name he knew he he knew that salvation was his he knew the Rapture was his he knew a body change was his he knew adoption every promise belong to him no wonder he quit cry no wonder he started rejoicing cuz now he knew he had an authority to claim his inheritance amen he didn't need to read John H to claim his inheritance he didn't need to reach some author of the book of some other book to know what his inheritance is God said Propet [Applause] now you know what this the the prophet said when the mighty Angel took the book and open the seals thereof amen I you know the prophet also said that Christ was God's love gift love gift I believe that when he took that book now this again just me looking into it that maybe he looked down and he saw people and his heart began to beat for them and he thought I can't just keep it to it myself I got to take it to them and God had already promised that he would send the prophet Malachi and we read in Revelations 101 that that Mighty angel came down with an open book that notice how God orchestrates everything the prophet said the seventh angel was on the earth at the same time of this coming because the word always comes to a prophet now if it was the closed book he might have given it to a theologian but this was an open book this would be a restored word the original thoughts of God would be unveiled and he gave it to a prophet to reveal to his people amen amen yes sir is this all right to reveal to his people can you say Amen you see now he had the authority to claim The Inheritance I want to say it this way it's not that we just go around claiming I claim this and I claim that and I claim this and I claim that and I claim this we're claiming what's written in the book under the headship of the word now now come on Church we've got charismatics back home that claim everything I got a family member that believes if you in a nice house if you ain't driving a nice car if you ain't got the nicest things in life then you're not Sav see it's a perversion of the devil come on Church yes you do have an authority to Acclaim you have an authority to claim what's yours in the book therefore a prophet rightly divided the word of Truth [Music] amen now uh brother Brandon he's he's he's in a meeting I'm taking it he's at home in in Jeffersonville sister Hatty rght is sitting in the audience and he has her to stand up and he says there's the little widow woman that the miracle happened on the first bypassing all the peoples of the world for that thing to happen first to that poor little humble widow woman up on the hillside up there trying to raise a crop of corn out of a cross crawfish ground out there to take care of her children that's the one God honored the first time since the days of Jesus Christ and said ask what you will I said I challenge anybody in the name of the Lord when that Spirit strikes and says that I don't care what you ask for it shall be granted amen when the spirit strikes like that he said now you know why the Pluto I guess that's what it's called plutocrats didn't get it or the big folks like that is because God know they had asked things that was no good for them what more could that woman he said what more just tell me anything she could ask greater than that which was her two [Music] sons her mother and father is saved her little sister sitting in a wheelchair was saved all the family saved except the two boys at that time they wasn't saved they are poor people so they weren't Rich they were barely making it they are poor people he said Shelby told me his constant income for good crop he Ned $600 a year work until the boy is about my age and it's all broke down everything and and working taking care of his daddy and mother and they're old and trying to take care of his little Afflicted sister but he saved brother right all of them are saved but them too was not saved and had he asked the salvation of her children long as there is an eternity she could have asked for 10,000 and got it she could have asked whatever she would but see God knows what you're going to ask before he ever places the anointing the prophet says he gives it to people who he knows will ask the right thing did you know even James says you asked can have not because you ask a Miss in other words you ask EV that you might bring it upon your own lust so there's the charismatics out there that's claiming everything but they're not under the headship of the word they're not under the headship of the promises come on chur amen but we're not like the charismatics we are the new thing that God is doing we are the generation that has come under the headship of the word amen come on Church yes the word is in the bride yes she has thus say the Lord but she stays still come on church she keeps still she keeps quiet until she is told to speak amen is this all right Hallelujah now I'm going tell you a story about my wife my first wife she had passed away but before she had passed away she told me she said Sean well first of all she came from a rough family and I don't want to go too off because probably online but I don't want to but she coming from a really rough family and uh I I had tried to talk to her mom or her dad one time about the Lord and it didn't go good her mom was claiming to be a Christian I'm a Christian but just to be honest she was a [Music] heathen and Rebecca she would tell me she said Sean she said I really want my mom to be saved now I'm going to be honest I was the D Thomas I didn't tell her but in my mind I thought there ain't no way that woman going to get sick was bad to the bone but all I would say is Rebecca just pray so she she would pray for years pray one day I was in the living room of her home and she was doing some laundry in the uh another room and I had the take playing perfect Faith ever listen perfect Faith Church you need to listen to perfect Faith but I was listening to perfect faith and brother Bram just kind talking about the promises and the spirit of the Lord just dropped in that place amen and Rebecca come out of that room come in the living room she looked at me and she said Sean you believe what brother brandham is saying is the truth I said you bet it's the truth she said well so do I she goes back in into doing laundry well the tape had finished and I got up to go in the kitchen and she she came into the kitchen we got to talking and she said Sean the presence of the Lord come into that utility [Music] room I said oh she said yeah she said uh something happened I said well what was it she said oh you you wouldn't believe it I said well tell me what what happened and she said well oh it's nothing I said all right what happened she said well Sean believe it or not when the presence of the Lord come down she said I heard myself say I send the Holy Ghost after my mother but she said Sean it wasn't me she said something got a hold of and she said I heard myself speak I send the Holy Ghost after my mother now her mama didn't talk to us didn't talk to her and so they didn't have much of relationship because of our beliefs but but she said Sean what does that mean I said well I don't know I said that all you can do is just wait and see what happens I go to town and when I come back a couple hours later my my wife was just bubbling and and she said Sean guess what I said what she said mama called me today I said she did I said well what did she have to say she said Sean she called crying she had just come out of the doctor's office and the doctor said she had cancer and that she didn't have long to live and she just said rebecc I want that Jesus that you and Sean have and Rebecca led her mother to the Lord now church that woman was changed I I it it it just you know I mean she' call every day just just bubbling just excited about and you know one day uh Rebecca told me she said you know I I've been talking to Mom and mama is lacking something and just don't know what it is I said Rebecca you know what that is I said your mom needs to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ he's like yeah that's right she said well won't you call her and answer her and I'm like now Rebecca she's your mother probably ought to go ahead and talk to she says yeah but you're you're a preacher you you would know how to explain it better so the best thing I could say was okay I'll pray about it the moment I said that the telephone rang we're sitting at the dinner table Rebecca says I'll go get it so she went and got the phone she comes back and she goes it's Mama she's wanting to get baptized now church I don't know how to explain them things but all I know she said Sean honey she said I would sit here reading the scripture and it just dawned on me I got to get baptized I said yes you do she got baptized in the name of Jesus Christ hello church now this is a woman I would have never thought I'd see in a dress they made fun of Rebecca for a dress but one day she called and I answered she said Sean honey she said said I going through the house just feeling this oppression over me she said I I tried to repent of everything I knew to think I should repent of but it wouldn't leave me she say I try to sing songs it just wouldn't leave and it just dawned on me just something come and a thought and about Rebecca wearing a [Music] dress she says I don't understand why she's all more dressed but she says I went into my closet looking for a skirt she said she said I took off these jeans and I put on a dress and that thing left me come on Church it wasn't just somebody wishing it to happen it was the spirit of God giv that girl an authority can you say amen amen see so we find that the lamb gave the book to the prophet to reveal it to his people and we are the people of the open book we are the children of promise I don't care what the enemy looks like I don't care what the opposition's like I don't care how many failures I have I'm not looking at the giant I'm looking at a promise and God said I'm an overcomer God said I'm Victorious God said I'm his child and I claim it in the name of the Lord I'm as Caleb as oh give me this mountain amen the promise is ours to take now listen I'm not going to waste my time fighting with quotes and arguing with the message I'm not going to waste my time pting out all the flaws brother random had I'm not going to waste my time trying to change what a prophet taught I am too busy claiming my Mountain God doesn't want you to sit around being dormant God wants you to claim your Mountain don't sit there cry about it don't sit there and wh about it don't sit there and wish for it to move you've got an authority God has commissioned you and upon the authority of the word every devil has to fall under your feet let the fighters do what they going to do but as for me I'm going to take my inheritance can you say amen I want to say this if you'll notice the fighters are losing their influence over this new generation that is going over into the land we ain't woring about false doctrines we ain't looking for some new agenda we're satisfied with the end time Prophet Joshua leader we are the Caleb of this age we're binding ourselves to everything around us and we're coming into the land taking our promise amen can you say Amen if you give me a few more moments if you notice God fed Israel through the Journey from Egypt to the promised land he fed a Mana but he told them don't keep that manner don't keep it for the next day and those who did found out that that man became wormy can you say Amen but notice when they come into the promised land they no longer were eating the Mana they were eating the corn of the land their food wasin the land [Applause] can you say Amen so if there was any manner to be left if there was any Mana that was brought over it was dead Ro come on church and the corn of this land came from a prophet for the angel of the Lord told him store up food any food outside of that is Maggy it's no good they can call us narrow mind if they want [Music] to narrow minded if they want to but that's okay I choose to stay with the prophet I choose to say what he said come on church I I hope this all right amen see they they weren't able they weren't wanting Baptist Doctrine to be brought into the new land they they they weren't wanting Pentecostal Doctrine land brought into the the new land all the traditions of the old had to die out I believe the prophet taught us a new way of doing things amen he taught us preachers how to preach he taught us how to have church he taught us parents how to raise our children he taught us Brothers how to treat our wives he taught you sisters how to treat your husband can you say Amen yes sir he taught it all well bless the name of the Lord I don't need to read about a psychologist on how to better my marriage I got an open [Applause] book I said this way you young people got an open book now it'll treat you how to date it'll teach you how to act with one another you got an open book come on Church the prophet did not bring us under legalism bless the name of the Lord I love him can you give the Lord a hand clap [Applause] now look John in Revelations 10:8 now he was told to eat the book but what was it it was an open book he was not eating a clothes book he was eating the very thing that the seventh angel was given so he wasn't bypassing the seventh angel the seventh angel had already had the book now John was to eat that book so he was digesting what the seventh angel had and when he ate it he was told to prophesy I believe that prophecy was none other than a confession what the prophet taught he was to teach what the prophet understood he was to [Music] understand the same spirit that inspired the prophet was to inspire him the spirit and the bride and the prophet will be saing the same thing amen amen the word is in the bride can you say that with me the word is in the bride that open word is in the bride the promise is now in [Music] hallelu sir Hallelujah he wasn't eating the book that the other ages ate they were eating from a close book but he had a different diet he was not eating partial truth mixed with everything else that man put in it he wasn't eating something that was with men's ideas a prophet did not preach his own opinion he had that sayth the Lord amen and whatever somebody else says well that's his opinion well I'll tell you like it's always been said I'll take his opinion in day over yours over mine over anybody's I'll take a prophet's opinion can you say and I am ashamed of what a prophet said see so what he done is he ate the original word the thoughts that God had before the foundation of the world John was feasting on it can you say Amen yes sir see man so we don't want to bring in Old mana and feed you with that we don't want to we don't want to feed off other ideas about things but God has done a new thing he's doing a new thing come on church but you are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people in other words you're God's Own possession you are the people that God created for this day for this land we are looking at an open book and we're seeing ourselves in it for the first time Amen brother Brandon would call it we're in the bride age the thoughts of God are being made known to us and are being manifested in us can I say you we are the book we are the book this book is taken on flesh I'm tired of reflecting man's ideas I'm tired of reflecting my denominations tired I'm tired of reflecting Creeds and darkness come on church God has created us to reflect the original word what God had in his mind is now being made manifest [Applause] [Music] en closing Jesus yes was the manifestation of the word of God the prophet said he was a man of a predestinated seat of God now Jesus knew who he was because he saw himself in the book you believe that he had a revelation he was not just reading about things that pertain to Messiah and says well I wonder who that is but he could read it and say that speaks of me he he could read it and say this day this scripture is being fulfilled but the prophet said Satan knew the word too hello the prophet said he knowed it from A to Z but Jesus knew the word in a different way than Satan did Brother Braham said Satan can impersonate any kind of gift that God's got but he cannot bring that word word by word in another place he said he know the word when he come to Eve but he had it by head knowledge and it wouldn't work he came to Jesus quoting scripture he could quote scripture but he couldn't place the scriptures he knew the word he could quote the word but he couldn't rightly divide the word but Jesus knew the word differently amen uhuh well do you love it so now notice how did he know the word the prophet said he knew it by faith in the revelation of God's word in his own predestinated life he said Glory I hope that soaks Plumb into your heart Jesus knew who he was Satan was wondering Jesus knew that he was a predestinated creature of God that God himself was manifested in him it wasn't him doing the works it was the father that dwelt in him he said let the devil fly with all of his theology see Satan knew it he knew the word he could quote that scripture boy just like a walk in Bible he could just quote it like that but Jesus just stood still for he knew where he was standing he know that he was predestinated that he was the lamb slain before the foundation of the world he know that he was that person he know that he was predestinated for that and that's the way he knew the word can you say Amen now I want to ask you we've had this Bible for years we've had men teaching this word for years that What Makes You Different what makes us ministers different is the way we know this Bible we're not looking at the promises is something far off we're looking at the promises right here we're telling you that this word speaks for you now when you look at this word you've got to look at it for yourself I was predestinated for this Rapture nobody going to take my place I was predestinated to take my lamb and nobody's going to take my place well lift up your hands unto the Lord and worship Him musicians will come hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah bless the name of the Lord in the open book seeing our name being identified with the word the word of God is our identification bless the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah there's that song There's No One There's No One
