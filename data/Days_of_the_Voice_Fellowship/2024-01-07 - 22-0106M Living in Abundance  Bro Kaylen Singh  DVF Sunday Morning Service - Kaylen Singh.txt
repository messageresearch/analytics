mighty name of Jesus Christ won't you speak to us oh God won you take Divine control now and minister to our hearts and our lives as we the service to you in the mighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen and amen amen amen while you stand with me I'd just like to read in the Bible from the Book of Joel chap 2 verse 23 to verse 27 I will read in English and then My Brother Sam will read in the home language he said be glad then you children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for he had given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of Wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the Locust had eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the p armor my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed amen [Music] [Music] for [Music] amen may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of the word you can have your seats this morning amen I trust happy to be in the house of the Lord I pray that the Lord would bless the word this morning amen and again forgive us for being a bit late but we pray that God would speak to our hearts and speak to our lives amen so I want to speak to you this morning on a thought that the lord has laid on my heart and I'll title it living in the Overflow living in the abundance living in the abundance amen the scripture that we read is a deep subject and you can preach a whole series on it but this morning I just want to focus on the results of the restoration and verse 24 says that the floor shall be full of [Music] Wheat and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil now the prophet of God would tell us that this was an end time prophecy it is something that's going to deal with our day in the third seal brother Bram would say now the same thing today when it rises on the scene now God said in Malachi 4 that he would send a message in the last days that would restore Joel said I will restore the years everything that Rome eat up everything the Methodist eat up everything the Baptist eat up that original Pentecostal Branch God said I will restore in the last days that's right and he can sense we are living in that season we are living in the hour of the complete restoration I trust you believe that this morning and when there's a restoration the bible promises that our flaws will be full of wheat and there will be an overflow with wine and oil and that word overflow means to give an abundance to give an abundance so God is making a promise to the church in the end time we are not going to be Beggars is there somebody with me God is giving a promise to the church in the end time that we don't have to settle for crumbs but there's going to be an outpouring of God a manifestation of God God is going to release an abundance upon his people I trust you believe that this morning we are not living in the time where we need to beg we are not living in the time where we need to borrow we are not living in a time where we need to keep asking but we living in a time where the Bible says before we ask he already knows before we speak he will answer we are living in that hour we are living in that time I trust you believe that church TR you can accept that we are special people we are people anointed we are people called We Are People chosen for this hour for this moment for this time we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we are the queen of heaven and God is entrusting us with the fully revealed word I hope you believe that we don't have a partial truth we don't have a portion of truth but this is the hour of abundance this is the hour of restoration what we read of in the Bible should be here today and it shouldn't be a special event I want to say this with reverence humility and respect the supernatural should be a daily occurrence in the lives of the Bride of Jesus Christ it shouldn't be something that shocks us when we hear about the angel of the Lord it shouldn't be something that surprises us when we hear about miracles when we hear about healings when we hear about Deliverance it shouldn't be surprising when we hear about Revival in the lives of the people it should be something we should be expecting it should be something that we should be looking for I hope you're with Meen this is not something that is coming down the line This is not something in the future but if you can believe that God has already sent a Prophet The Prophet's work is done the prophet's work is done his work was the work of restoration to bring us back to the Bible the way Paul had it the way Peter had it the way the book of Acts had it so God had to bring a message to take us back to the Bible then there must be a people who will now be the people of the Bible there must be a people who are a continuation of the book of Acts listen friends we are not living in the time where God is giving a message we are not living in the time where God is giving a message the message has been given the message has been delivered the message has been given it is time that John takes the book and eats the book and becomes the book now it is John's time to prophesy again Hallelujah Hallelujah we may not be the givers of the message because it's been given but we have been entrusted to take the given message and give it to the people hallelujah I hope you with me do you love the Lord amen there's a promise of restoration a promise of abundance the prophet said Jo the FL shall be full of [Music] wheat in the harest time brother Bram would say notice now he's seen the perfect one he struck him he M him Isaiah said he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity he was that perfect word reflected for bread that every man shall live by that's Jesus Christ he's the wheat of God's word that could be ground and put into four gospels and 66 books and Men shall live by that and that alone every word of it amen the floor shall be full of [Music] Wheat and wheat is the bread and that bread is Jesus Christ that bread is Jesus Christ and God has ground him put him into the four gospels and in the 6 books and Men shall live by that amen we are to feed on the body word the son of man do you believe that listen friends in this hour we don't have a partial revelation we don't just have a peace we have the fully revealed word is not here with the Shar but at the opening of The Seven Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to be born into manifestation again and Vindicated by the spirit of God in the full strength as he was when he was here on Earth amen Hebrews 138 said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Luke 17:30 Jesus said in the last days as it was in the days of Sodom the son of man will be revealing himself again it will be the same thing are we living in that day has the book come open is the word full fully revealed our flaws are full of wheat our flaws are full of wheat Jesus is that wheat Jesus is that wheat and the bride is feeding on that body word of the son of man we are not feeding on denominational teachings we are not feeding on manmade theories we not feeding on some men's teachings we are actually feeding on the very mind of God hallelujah we are feeding on the very mind of God and his mind has been expressed in this hour do you believe that we're not waiting for any more revelation huah we are not waiting for any more Revelation in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God is finished are we living in that day amen I believe the church is called the days of the voice so the name of the church is a declaration that we are living in the hour when the days of the voice is being made known on the earth do you believe that church amen we have an open book remember the Bible says when the mighty Angel descended the book was open is that right the book was open now I can tell you no man can close close it no man can seal it no man can hide it because God opened it and if God opened it no man can shut it if God revealed it no man can take it away no man can explain it away when God has made it known to you this is the truth if somebody explain it someone can talk you out of it somebody talks you into it someone can talk you out of it but if God has revealed it if God has made it known to you as an individual that this message is the truth that this word is y and amen I don't care what may come I don't care who may rise up I don't care how many apostles may show up can can I preach can I preach it I don't care who shows up I don't care which Bishop rocks up I don't care which Man shows up that claims to be the leader of the Bride when God has revealed it to you that this message is thus sayth the Lord there is no devil in hell there is no power there is no principality there is nothing coming there is no man there is no preacher there is nobody that's going to be able to talk you out of it you are there you are there that Pillar of Fire you personally I want to tell you something church every Born Again believer every Born Again believer with the Holy Ghost whether you believe it or not has met the pillar of fire Hallelujah you say that's impossible that Holy Ghost in you is the pillar of Fire hallelujah hallelujah Glory blessed be the name of the Lord so when you met the Holy Ghost you met your burning bush when you met the holy ghost that Pillar of Fire is no longer a picture that we have in the churches over a prophet's head that pillar of fire has moved has moved you see friends we're not here to build a shrine we are not here to build a temple the pillar of fire was one that moved when the children of Israel moved it was a pillar of fire would lead them by night and A Cloud by day it was the same God in different manifestation but he was not one known to stand still so you can't put him on a picture and leave him on a wall and see that's the pillar of Fire come on church was that Pillar of Fire that was photographed he's now moving he's alive now he's in his bride now and he's the one leading he's the one guiding remember according to the church ages we in night time we're in night time there is cross darkness and that Pillar of Fire is here to lead the bride on you are being led by the very Pillar of Fire that was photographed all those years ago he's not dead he's alive he's real he's moving do you believe that is here today that Pillar of Fire is the word in the beginning what the word the word was with God the Word was God that word was made flesh did you notice the word according to the Bible is not a book the word according to the Bible is a person the word according to the Bible is a person that person is Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's why I said somewhere else you can bur this Bible you can't bur the word you can destroy this Bible but you can't destroy the word you can burn the tapes but you can't burn the word you can burn the books but you can't burn the word because the word is a p the word is a person this message that we've been introduced to is not a teaching this message is not a Doctrine this message is a person this message is a person his name is Jesus Christ you believe that that's why brother Brandon would tell us in one place in the rising of the sun he says Jesus Christ is those seals so what is those seals then it's revealing Jesus Christ that's why God opened the book so that you can know Jesus the way Paul knew Jesus you can know Jesus the way Peter knew Jesus listen brother when Peter and John at the gate called Beautiful they said Silver and Gold Have I None but wait let me go press play for you is that what they told him what did they tell you is Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give unto you those men held the lame men's healing those men held the lame men's healing inside of them remember the the prophet tells us that man was 40 years old so he was sitting at that gate even when Jesus was herey I hope you all right why didn't Jesus heal him why didn't Jesus physically take him by the hand and lift him up because Jesus left the work for the people coming behind him he knew that man's healing was lying in Peter and John and that's why you are here today that's why God has a bride here today that's why God has a church on the Earth today there are people in ugandauganda in Ethiopia there are people depending on Peter and John to show up those people's Miracles lying inside you those people's Deliverance is right inside you God has commissioned you God has anointed you God has charged you God has placed you in this hour in this moment listen dear daddy when your baby is sick your baby's healing lying inside you come on somebody listen mama when your baby is sick your baby is healing lying inside you you become Peter you become John you become the word to a generation that now needs the word in flesh hallelujah hallelujah we have an abundance of it do you believe that this is the word church the word is not a sermon I'm preaching to you the word but the word is not my sermon the word is Jesus Christ [Music] Hallelujah so when you apply the word you are applying Jesus Christ when you apply the word when you speak the word you are speaking Jesus I speak Jesus over every circumstance I speak Jesus over every [Music] situation that this morning we are living in the Overflow we are living in the abundance we will have a flow full of [Music] wheat Hallelujah let me tell you something you can't exhaust this [Music] message if you tired of this message please check your experience If the message is getting stale check your experience cuz you're in the wrong Court you in the wrong section of the building cuz when you were on the outside of the temple the manner could get still but but when you were in the holiest of holies when the veil dropped and you were in the Shak presence of God that manner never got still it will never get old you can hear the same sermon 5,000 times and each time you'll get something else because it can't get still are you with me Church let's not be like those people that the Bible talks about when God gave the Mana they weren't happy with the taste so they decided to recook it we're not interfering with the manner we're just going to dish it out the way God gave it amen am we're going to stay with the message message of the hour we're going to stay with the word of God we are drawing a line and we refuse to give up we refuse to surrender we refuse to back up we refuse to give in there's going to be a bride you are it if there's going to be a rapture you are the people going if there's going to be an elect lady you are that lady if there's going to be a church that that brings back Jesus Christ you are the [Applause] church Hallelujah you love the Lord can I preach a little bit in the leodan church age the prophet of God would say already the visible manifestations of what I have been telling you are seen all around us the eunic move of the tars is factual but it is also a fact that the prophet for the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will forun the second coming of the Lord for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal fathers now listen to this and with the restoration of the word have we just labored to see that that the word is restored you accept the word is restored you believe the word is restored and I want you to listen to this with the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the [Music] power the restoration of the word will come the restoration of the power has the word been restored our

restoration of the word must come a restoration of power the Bible says that our flaws will overflow with wine and oil Amen brother Bram would tell us what the wine and oil is he says the oil is the holy spirit do you believe that the oil is the Holy Spirit you believe that in the Feast of the trumpets he would say the Holy Spirit has been bound by this denomination Rivers years but is to be Lo in the evening time by the evening time message the Holy Spirit back in the church again Christ himself revealed in human flesh in the evening time he said it he promised it the message of the hour

boat you are going to the other side [Music] did Jesus lie so you telling me that Jesus did not know the storm was coming he you but even knowing the storm was coming he said we're going to the other [Applause] side notice when Jesus spoke to his disciples he didn't say oh thank you for waking me up that I could speak to the storm thank you for calling me on the seene what did Jesus do he says you

supposed to contribute 100,000 no each member of the church is supposed to contribute 100,000 if the Lord has provided to you you can sacrifice please do that if you are a man and his wife contribute 200,000 if you can there are sever who have already done that and God bless you so much and if you haven't yet done it I'm requesting you to please do today or before the end of Thursday because our

people to contribute 50,000 each uh but that is only a little piece of what we need for each person so we are even planning if there will be need to have the boys sleep at our a certain School Clos
