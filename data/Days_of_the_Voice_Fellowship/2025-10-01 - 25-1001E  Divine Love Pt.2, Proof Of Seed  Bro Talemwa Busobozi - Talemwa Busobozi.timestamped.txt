[35:42] Evening.
[35:44] So uh just send my greetings to all the
[35:47] saints uh that are fellowshipping with
[35:49] us on Zoom.
[35:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:56] &gt;&gt; So that would mean that I'm going to
[35:57] speak for one hour
[36:01] not more.
[36:03] So let's just go to the book of John
[36:08] chapter 13.
[36:10] This would be part two of what I spoke
[36:12] on on Sunday here
[36:18] on divine love.
[36:22] &gt;&gt; And the other title I wanted to give it
[36:24] was proof of seed.
[36:26] [Music]
[36:32] John 13 33.
[36:38] Amen.
[36:41] Little children, yet a little while I am
[36:44] with you. Ye shall seek me and uh and as
[36:48] I said unto the Jews, wheither I go, ye
[36:51] cannot come. So now I say to you,
[36:57] a new commandment I give unto you, that
[37:00] ye love one another, as I have loved
[37:03] you, that ye also love one another. By
[37:08] this by this shall all men know that ye
[37:11] are my disciples, if ye have love one to
[37:17] another.
[37:22] 133.
[37:26] Amen.
[37:49] [Music]
[38:07] Amen. May you may be seated, please.
[38:13] Um on Sunday we had a good time on this
[38:16] subject
[38:19] &gt;&gt; and I had a bunch of people who really
[38:21] came to me and told me that they were
[38:23] really blessed and that it was for them
[38:28] and I also heard of some who were
[38:30] offended.
[38:33] They're saying that uh it looked like I
[38:36] was picking on them.
[38:39] But as I always say that when the word
[38:41] of God comes,
[38:44] it really comes to pick on you
[38:47] to to to help you and that's the purpose
[38:50] of the word
[38:52] so that it can correct us.
[38:55] So tonight we are just continuing with
[38:57] that thought
[39:00] and I pray that God will give you
[39:02] understanding,
[39:06] an open heart,
[39:08] revelation
[39:09] to know what he his spirit is saying.
[39:14] Now if you see the words of Jesus here,
[39:18] he says that ye shall seek me and and
[39:22] and whether I go, you cannot come.
[39:27] But now I say unto you, a new
[39:30] commandment I give unto you,
[39:33] that ye love one another,
[39:35] as I have loved you,
[39:38] that ye also love one another.
[39:41] Now you notice that Jesus is suggesting
[39:43] to us that we should love one another
[39:46] the way he loved us.
[39:52] But really, how did he love us?
[39:57] For God so loved the world
[40:00] that he gave his only begotten son.
[40:04] Whoever believeth in him
[40:06] shall not perish but have everlasting
[40:09] life.
[40:10] God loved the unloved.
[40:14] What you can say the unlovable.
[40:18] Yeah. And that's what he loved.
[40:21] He did not love us on the basis of our
[40:23] actions on our good actions.
[40:28] God did not love us because we had loved
[40:31] him.
[40:34] We actually sing a song that he loved me
[40:36] before I knew him.
[40:40] You see, we that English word there has
[40:42] the word error. Before error is before e
[40:45] r e.
[40:49] Yeah. Before he loved me,
[40:52] before I knew him, he loved me. So I
[40:56] want you to understand
[40:59] the love of God.
[41:01] The love of God is very different from
[41:04] the love of man.
[41:07] And when we talk about and I had a
[41:09] discussion with a brother after the
[41:10] service
[41:14] and it seemed there are many things that
[41:15] we would really talk about when it comes
[41:17] to the subject of divine love
[41:22] and you know he asked me a question. He
[41:24] said, "Does it mean that if I love
[41:26] somebody
[41:28] that I should, you know, forgive them
[41:31] without condition
[41:35] and I should let them despitefully use
[41:37] me
[41:40] and you know so there is a
[41:42] misunderstanding of what love is.
[41:47] You know, we are not talking about human
[41:49] love.
[41:51] We are talking about divine love. Divine
[41:54] love is different from human love.
[41:59] Divine love, human love is the uh the
[42:04] the downgraded love of God.
[42:12] If you see the love of God is the is the
[42:15] ultimate God.
[42:19] It is with no condition.
[42:23] You love somebody regardless of what
[42:25] they have done or what they have not
[42:27] done.
[42:30] God did not love you
[42:33] because you were the best in your cult
[42:35] in your family
[42:37] or because you loved him more than
[42:39] others.
[42:42] Do you understand? There are people who
[42:44] pray day and night.
[42:48] Some of them fast for 40 days.
[42:51] All in the name of loving God.
[42:55] Others are preaching on the streets.
[42:58] Others cut their body.
[43:01] Others they beat themselves
[43:03] in form of sacraments.
[43:07] Others they pray hail Marys and I don't
[43:09] know how many times
[43:12] you know. But with all that many of
[43:15] those shall not go in the rapture.
[43:19] So if you say they don't love God,
[43:22] you you you are not you are not saying
[43:24] the truth.
[43:26] You you are a liar and the truth is not
[43:29] in you. These people genuinely humanly
[43:33] love God.
[43:38] But you see God does not want us to love
[43:40] him with our human love.
[43:46] No one among us can be able to love God
[43:49] with our human love
[43:53] because our human love cannot be
[43:55] trusted.
[43:57] Our human love is watered down.
[44:02] Our human love will always fail.
[44:06] Our human love is bound by conditions.
[44:11] You can love somebody so much today and
[44:14] tomorrow you will hate them as much as
[44:15] you love them
[44:21] because of what they did to you.
[44:25] And and so that is not love.
[44:28] The love I'm talking about, but the love
[44:30] I'm talking about is called divine love.
[44:37] Divine love which is the love of God.
[44:40] is beyond conditions.
[44:44] Regardless of what someone has done,
[44:49] regardless of what they have said
[44:50] against you,
[44:52] regardless of what they have done
[44:54] against you,
[44:56] you will love them. And that love is
[44:59] permanent.
[45:01] It does not shift.
[45:03] It does not change. It does not reduce.
[45:07] It does not increase. It is permanent.
[45:10] It stays. It is called divine love.
[45:15] Now, this is the love God had for us.
[45:19] When he loved us, he loved us before we
[45:22] were born.
[45:25] He says, Jacob have I love
[45:28] and Esau have I hate. When did he love
[45:31] you? He loved him before he was born.
[45:36] He loved him before he was in his
[45:37] mother's womb
[45:40] and he hated Isa before he was in his
[45:42] mother's womb.
[45:46] So what basis did God base on to love
[45:52] in his
[45:54] um um immutable power authority
[46:00] in his grace
[46:03] he loved
[46:05] But you see, all those that he says he
[46:08] loved
[46:10] were those that were in him
[46:15] because they were his attributes.
[46:19] Follow me closely. They were his
[46:22] attribute
[46:24] before the foundation of the world.
[46:27] And so they did not do anything so that
[46:31] they can be able to qualify for that
[46:34] love.
[46:38] They qualified for that love because of
[46:40] who they were. Hallelujah.
[46:46] Before Jacob did any bad, before Esau
[46:49] did any good,
[46:53] God loved Jacob and hated Esau.
[46:57] Because Esau's seed was different.
[47:01] Both loved Esau
[47:05] and that was human love.
[47:08] But you see with human love
[47:11] you can even love the wrong person.
[47:16] That is why never rely on your human
[47:18] love
[47:20] because your human love you have it
[47:22] today and tomorrow you don't own it.
[47:26] it will shift on you. It is a feeling
[47:30] which is driven by conditions and
[47:33] situations.
[47:37] But you see the divine love which is the
[47:39] love of God.
[47:41] It's not driven by condition or
[47:43] situation.
[47:46] It is moved by God.
[47:49] It is permanent.
[47:51] Amen. As long as you have God in your
[47:53] heart,
[47:55] you will love permanently.
[47:58] Now when I say that God loved Jacob and
[48:00] he hated Israel,
[48:03] it does not mean that God hates
[48:05] unbelievers.
[48:08] For God loved the world.
[48:12] If you have the love of God in you,
[48:16] you will love everyone,
[48:18] a believer and an unbeliever alike.
[48:23] You see, when Cain and Abel
[48:26] began to express who they were,
[48:29] you realize that each of them had a seed
[48:32] in them.
[48:34] Kane had a seed of God. And Abel,
[48:37] rather, Abel had a seed of God and Kenya
[48:39] had a seed of God.
[48:43] And as we saw on Sunday,
[48:46] it is not possible
[48:48] for a person for the serpent seed
[48:53] for the seed of the serpent to have this
[48:56] love I am talking about today
[49:02] because Satan cannot love.
[49:07] I read for you a few quotes but I'll
[49:09] read for you some more here.
[49:13] Praise the name of the Lord. I'm just
[49:15] going to break it, break it, and take it
[49:17] as how the Holy Spirit will lead.
[49:22] You see in the message, faith is a
[49:23] substance.
[49:25] Satan can copy any kind of a gift.
[49:29] Any kind of a manifestation,
[49:32] but he cannot love.
[49:35] God is love.
[49:37] Satan cannot love.
[49:40] Amen.
[49:41] So Satan cannot love and his children
[49:44] cannot love.
[49:47] But God is love
[49:49] and his children love.
[49:52] And the kind of love I'm talking about
[49:55] is divine love.
[49:58] God is love. God is love.
[50:04] And that love never wears off.
[50:07] Because of this love. Amen. God came to
[50:10] Cain
[50:12] and he told him, "If thou doest well,
[50:16] will you not be accepted?"
[50:20] And I always say in that phrase, in that
[50:23] statement,
[50:25] God preached to serpent seed
[50:29] and was trying to say something serpent
[50:31] seed
[50:32] that because of my love,
[50:36] you two can be saved.
[50:39] Because of my love,
[50:41] you too can be accepted.
[50:43] Because of my love, you too can be
[50:46] redeemed. Because of my love, you too
[50:50] can be in the beloved.
[50:52] But the problem was not God is love.
[50:56] We sing that God's love reaches even to
[50:59] the lowest hell.
[51:03] God's love surpasses anything that you
[51:05] know.
[51:08] But you see, the only reason why it does
[51:12] not seem to reach some people like Kane
[51:19] is they do not have something to h that
[51:24] love.
[51:29] They do not have the seed
[51:32] of life in them because they are the
[51:35] serpent seed.
[51:38] So they cannot receive the love
[51:42] but God will always give his love
[51:45] but they cannot receive the
[51:48] remember it is it is a burden and and as
[51:52] long as you receive it
[51:58] is the word. It is the life and as long
[52:01] as you receive it.
[52:05] But if you don't receive it,
[52:07] it will give you death.
[52:10] The same water which saved Noah and his
[52:14] people,
[52:17] killed everybody else.
[52:20] You see, this word is a double-edged
[52:23] sword.
[52:25] And God is love.
[52:28] And and the love is the word and God is
[52:30] the word.
[52:33] Praise God.
[52:35] Praise God.
[52:37] So when we talk about divine love,
[52:41] Jesus said, "A new commandment I gave
[52:43] you.
[52:45] That ye love one another." He's talking
[52:48] to who? He's talking to the believers.
[52:51] He's talking to the sea. Amen. And he
[52:54] says, "Then ye they shall know that ye
[52:58] are my disciples."
[53:02] The only proof
[53:04] that someone is a true disciple of
[53:06] Christ,
[53:09] he will have love,
[53:12] divine love.
[53:14] It is impossible
[53:16] for someone who is not born again
[53:20] to have this divine love.
[53:23] You can try to pretend.
[53:26] You can try to mimic it. But I tell you,
[53:29] sister, brother, what I'm talking about,
[53:33] it is impossible to pretend it.
[53:38] It is impossible to pretend that you
[53:40] have it.
[53:42] You can only pretend for so long,
[53:45] but one day something happens when
[53:49] you're truly exposed.
[53:52] Because I told you human love fails with
[53:56] situations.
[54:00] Circumstances will fail you.
[54:03] So circumstances will happen in your
[54:05] life
[54:07] and then you will say I will not go to
[54:08] church again
[54:10] and then you will become indifferent
[54:13] and then you become bitter
[54:15] and then you don't like a brother, you
[54:17] don't like a sister.
[54:19] Then we can know
[54:22] you don't have that love in your heart.
[54:26] So you can imagine how many people will
[54:28] miss the rapture.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; And you know you don't need to wait
[54:35] until then.
[54:39] You can design yourself by the hearing
[54:41] of the word.
[54:44] How far are you?
[54:47] If you don't have this divine love, my
[54:49] brother,
[54:51] Don't pretend about it.
[54:54] Ask God to fill you with the baptism of
[54:56] the Holy Ghost.
[54:58] Because when you are born again,
[55:01] it is an automatic thing.
[55:05] No preacher can give it to you. No
[55:07] church can give it to you. You see, you
[55:10] receive it automatically
[55:13] the moment you are born again.
[55:18] Praise God.
[55:21] Praise God.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You remember that I I spoke to you on
[55:26] Sunday and we read uh uh maybe I'll just
[55:29] rehearse a few things today. 1 John
[55:30] chapter 3.
[55:34] In the interest of time, we just say
[55:36] what I'm saying. For this is the message
[55:38] that he had from the beginning
[55:41] that we should love one another
[55:44] not as Cain.
[55:46] The moment he begins to talk about love,
[55:50] he talks about Cain,
[55:53] talks, he goes to the seed. You remember
[55:56] before he talked about love
[55:59] in first John 3, he was speaking about
[56:02] the right. He was speaking about
[56:04] righteousness
[56:06] and that he that loves God doeth
[56:08] righteousness.
[56:11] And I told you this is not the
[56:12] righteousness of the law.
[56:16] It is the righteousness of God
[56:19] which comes to you when you receive the
[56:22] Holy Spirit.
[56:24] And that's why Jesus said a new
[56:26] commandment I give you.
[56:29] This 11th commandment
[56:32] once you have it. What is it? Love.
[56:36] Divine love. Once you have it, you have
[56:40] fulfilled all the requirement of the
[56:42] Lord.
[56:47] And this is the message that we heard
[56:49] from the beginning
[56:51] that we should love one another not as
[56:54] Cain who was of that wicked one.
[56:58] and he slew his brother. And the
[57:01] question was, why did he kill him?
[57:05] Because his own works were evil
[57:09] and his brother's works were righteous.
[57:13] You see, marvel not, my brethren, if the
[57:15] world hate you.
[57:19] So the world will always hate the
[57:21] believers.
[57:23] But the believers will never hate the
[57:24] world.
[57:27] When I say the world, I mean the people
[57:28] in the world.
[57:30] &gt;&gt; The believers, a believer will never
[57:32] hate the people, anyone.
[57:36] You will never hate a brother. And you
[57:39] know the Bible when he says here,
[57:42] follow me closely.
[57:44] He says, "Not as Cain who was of that
[57:48] wicked one
[57:50] and slew his brother." So he's now
[57:53] saying that Cain was Abel's brother.
[57:57] But actually we know that we are of two
[57:58] different fathers.
[58:02] We are living in this world as pilgrims
[58:05] and strangers.
[58:08] This is not our home. The father of this
[58:11] world is not our father.
[58:13] Our father is from above. But while we
[58:16] are in the world, we have our brothers
[58:19] here
[58:21] from the same mother but from a
[58:23] different father.
[58:25] Brother says they all in the framework
[58:27] of the Christian church.
[58:33] They our brothers. You see, someone may
[58:36] disagree with you.
[58:38] They may have a different opinion on the
[58:40] same thing.
[58:42] They may even believe some other
[58:44] doctrine.
[58:47] But as long as they believe Christ,
[58:50] they are your brother.
[58:52] Hallelujah. But now the test,
[58:56] the test of a true genuine believer
[59:02] is if you have love
[59:05] regardless of what they believe,
[59:10] regardless of what they do to you,
[59:13] regardless of what they say, you
[59:16] love them the same way.
[59:20] Not pretending,
[59:22] but genuine.
[59:24] When you shake their hand, you can say,
[59:26] "I truly genuinely love you."
[59:30] &gt;&gt; And you mean it. No attitude.
[59:35] How many have reached that level?
[59:41] A believer's enemy
[59:44] should be the devil only.
[59:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[59:51] Amen.
[59:52] &gt;&gt; Mother not my brethren.
[59:55] If the world hate you, we know that we
[59:57] have passed from death unto life
[1:00:01] because because we love the brethren.
[1:00:06] He that loveth not his brother
[1:00:11] abides in death.
[1:00:14] Can we all say amen to that? If you
[1:00:16] don't love your brother,
[1:00:19] you you are in death. which means you
[1:00:22] are not born again.
[1:00:25] You are not yet born again
[1:00:28] until you love your brother.
[1:00:30] Whosoever hates his brother
[1:00:34] is a murderer and he know that no
[1:00:37] murderer has eternal life abiding in
[1:00:39] him.
[1:00:46] So in other words,
[1:00:48] Cain was a murderer
[1:00:50] because he hated.
[1:00:54] You know, brother Bam in the church age
[1:00:56] book many places
[1:00:58] shows us that the other seed
[1:01:02] will always hurt the seed of God.
[1:01:06] The false church will always hurt the
[1:01:09] truth.
[1:01:11] The serpent seed will always hurt the
[1:01:14] truth
[1:01:17] and their mothers.
[1:01:19] If they can do anything to you, they
[1:01:20] will do it.
[1:01:24] But Abel loved Cain
[1:01:28] to his grave.
[1:01:31] If you can't love your enemy,
[1:01:35] you don't have eternal life.
[1:01:39] If you can't have a love for somebody
[1:01:41] that that doesn't agree with you,
[1:01:45] you don't have eternal life dwelling in
[1:01:47] you.
[1:01:53] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Now, let me show you something here
[1:02:04] in the Ladesian church age.
[1:02:08] He said, "Now we we can see why there
[1:02:10] were two vines,
[1:02:14] one true and one false.
[1:02:17] Now we can see why Abraham had two sons,
[1:02:21] one after the flesh
[1:02:24] and that persecuted Isaac
[1:02:27] and one after promise."
[1:02:31] Now we can see how that out of the same
[1:02:33] parents
[1:02:37] two boys came forth as twins.
[1:02:41] Same parents, two boys came out as
[1:02:43] twins.
[1:02:45] One knowing and loving the things of of
[1:02:47] God
[1:02:49] and the other the other knowing much of
[1:02:52] the same truth
[1:02:55] but not of the same spirit.
[1:02:59] There are some brothers
[1:03:02] who will claim to believe this message,
[1:03:05] but they don't have the same spirit that
[1:03:07] you have.
[1:03:11] They are within the same church.
[1:03:15] They within the same faith.
[1:03:17] I'm trying to show you something.
[1:03:19] Saints,
[1:03:21] these two seeds have been growing
[1:03:22] together from the very beginning.
[1:03:27] from right from the first church
[1:03:30] of Ephesians. Those two seeds were there
[1:03:34] and they were planted at the same time
[1:03:37] rather one was planted and the other was
[1:03:39] planted
[1:03:42] and and then when the servant said to
[1:03:44] the master
[1:03:46] should we approve the bad seed
[1:03:50] he said no you cannot
[1:03:52] wait until the time of the harvest.
[1:03:55] Amen. That's when we are going to see
[1:03:57] the manifestations
[1:04:00] of the two seeds.
[1:04:02] Do you know we are right in that time?
[1:04:06] We are living in the end time
[1:04:09] when those two seeds are beginning to
[1:04:11] manifest themselves.
[1:04:16] You are beginning to manifest who you
[1:04:18] are.
[1:04:20] When the time of maturity has come,
[1:04:24] listen church. When the time of maturity
[1:04:26] has come,
[1:04:28] you cannot pretend.
[1:04:33] It is a must. You have to bring out what
[1:04:36] is in you.
[1:04:39] Amen. If you are if you are the right
[1:04:42] seed, it has to manifest.
[1:04:45] If if you are the the the chaff for the
[1:04:47] wheat, the the cocoa, you have to
[1:04:50] manifest
[1:04:53] now. That's the time we are living in.
[1:04:57] You have to show what fruit you have.
[1:05:00] That's why he said he shall know them by
[1:05:02] what? By their fruit.
[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; That shows what they bearing, what what
[1:05:10] they bearing, what is in them,
[1:05:15] what is coming out of. Jesus said what
[1:05:19] goes into the mouth
[1:05:22] does not defile it
[1:05:24] but what comes out of it
[1:05:28] that's what def
[1:05:35] cannot defy you
[1:05:38] are hearing the word you are hearing the
[1:05:39] word you hearing the word but do you
[1:05:42] know some people the more they hear the
[1:05:44] word the more worse they become
[1:05:50] and others the more they hear the word
[1:05:52] the better they become.
[1:05:55] What's happening? The issue is on the
[1:05:58] sea.
[1:06:02] The life that is in you
[1:06:05] but some of us have the life of God in
[1:06:08] you.
[1:06:09] We are the predestinated seed of God
[1:06:15] and we have come into this world to
[1:06:17] manifest who really we are.
[1:06:21] We were bad. But the more we hear the
[1:06:24] word, we become better and better and
[1:06:28] better every day.
[1:06:32] Praise God. Praise God. And some of the
[1:06:35] things we begin to drop them.
[1:06:38] We had hatred in our heart. We had envy
[1:06:42] in our heart. We had jealousy in our
[1:06:44] heart. But you see the more of the word
[1:06:47] come,
[1:06:49] the more lovely we become.
[1:06:52] You need to see all those old time
[1:06:55] people who were filled with the Holy
[1:06:56] Ghost.
[1:06:59] Regardless of what you thought you
[1:07:01] believed,
[1:07:04] they loved you this.
[1:07:07] Let me tell you, brother, that's the
[1:07:09] proof of who you are.
[1:07:12] It shows what is in you. You cannot
[1:07:15] bring out love when you don't have love
[1:07:17] in you.
[1:07:21] [Music]
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; And you can't pretend either.
[1:07:28] You either have the maze
[1:07:32] on you as a fruit
[1:07:36] or you have nothing. You are just a
[1:07:38] weed.
[1:07:42] What fruits are you bearing?
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:46] What fruits do you have as a Christian?
[1:07:49] as a brother,
[1:07:51] as a sister, what fields are coming out
[1:07:54] of you.
[1:07:56] [Music]
[1:07:57] You know what shows that we are
[1:07:58] believers is not when we come to church
[1:08:00] and shout and clap our hands and feel
[1:08:01] good.
[1:08:06] What shows that we are a believer is how
[1:08:07] we live dayto day in our life
[1:08:13] outside of the church.
[1:08:16] That shows who we really are.
[1:08:21] Brothers and sisters, we are coming at a
[1:08:23] time of full manifestation.
[1:08:27] This is a time we can't hide what is in
[1:08:29] us.
[1:08:32] Get deeper in Christ
[1:08:34] and begin to pull out what has been in
[1:08:37] you, all his word.
[1:08:42] The more you hear the word, the more
[1:08:45] lovely you should become,
[1:08:48] the more bitterness you will drop away.
[1:08:52] Someone may do something against you
[1:08:56] and they may hurt you. But don't you
[1:08:58] worry if you have God in your heart.
[1:09:03] That's why the Bible says if someone has
[1:09:05] done something to you, you go to him.
[1:09:09] How can you do that
[1:09:12] if you don't have this divine love?
[1:09:16] It is impossible. It is impossible.
[1:09:19] Normally, humanly speaking,
[1:09:23] we will say it is him who did it.
[1:09:26] Let him come and apologize.
[1:09:31] And when he comes, you will say, "I'm
[1:09:33] not satisfied.
[1:09:36] I the way you are apologizing I'm not
[1:09:38] even satisfied.
[1:09:41] You don't even have tears.
[1:09:44] You're not even kneeling down. You are
[1:09:46] not even I'm not satisfied.
[1:09:49] I'm not forgiven until I see tears
[1:09:55] and when they show tears.
[1:09:58] Okay. But the way you are speaking,
[1:10:04] it is not conviction. There's no
[1:10:06] conviction there.
[1:10:09] That shows you are walking in the flesh.
[1:10:13] You are still a cannon believer.
[1:10:17] But brother, if you're a spiritual
[1:10:18] believer,
[1:10:21] If you are mature,
[1:10:23] if you have divine love, you will not
[1:10:26] wait for them to come to you.
[1:10:28] You will go to them and say, "Brother,
[1:10:31] you offended me
[1:10:33] when you did this and this. And before
[1:10:36] they say a word, you have already
[1:10:39] forgiven them." Hallelujah. That's what
[1:10:42] Jesus did when he came down. He came and
[1:10:46] told us you did this and this and this
[1:10:48] and this and this before we say the word
[1:10:52] he said don't you worry I have paid the
[1:10:54] price I forgiven you already you are
[1:10:58] free and he say love everybody
[1:11:03] love one another as I have loved you
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:09] that's the love of God friends
[1:11:12] and until we come to that spot
[1:11:16] We still you still need to be born
[1:11:18] again.
[1:11:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:24] &gt;&gt; Now we can see how that out of the same
[1:11:27] parents two boys came forth as twins.
[1:11:34] One knowing and loving the things of the
[1:11:36] of God
[1:11:40] and the other knowing much of the same
[1:11:41] truth.
[1:11:44] but not of the same spirit
[1:11:47] and hence he persecuted the child that
[1:11:51] was elect.
[1:11:55] God did not reprobate for the sake of
[1:11:57] reprobation.
[1:12:01] He reprobated for the sake of the elite
[1:12:09] because of the elect.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Because of the elect.
[1:12:13] God did not just decide to hate Israel,
[1:12:18] but his hands were tied
[1:12:20] because of the healing.
[1:12:23] Hallelujah. Amen. And he came to you.
[1:12:26] And he said, "I love you.
[1:12:29] I love you." Not because you did
[1:12:31] something good. Simply because you are
[1:12:34] the elect.
[1:12:36] Sometimes
[1:12:38] even life may not be well.
[1:12:41] You may not have money, even for food,
[1:12:46] even for basic needs,
[1:12:48] but then God says, "I love you and the
[1:12:52] proof of my love is that you are the
[1:12:54] elect." Hallelujah.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Can you imagine
[1:13:03] that? The proof that he loves you, not
[1:13:08] is not when he gives you a car.
[1:13:12] is that when he does all these good
[1:13:13] things for you,
[1:13:15] he will prove that he loves you
[1:13:19] through election.
[1:13:23] So when you're walking,
[1:13:25] you're walking with shoulder heart.
[1:13:28] Brother said, "We believe in eternal
[1:13:30] security."
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:36] Amen. Amen. Oh, how he loves me.
[1:13:42] Oh, how he loves me.
[1:13:45] I know not why.
[1:13:50] Oh, how he loves.
[1:13:54] Amen. I have a friend, a precious
[1:13:57] friend.
[1:13:59] Oh, he loves me.
[1:14:02] You know what? He loved me before I even
[1:14:06] knew him.
[1:14:08] Tell me what greater love than that
[1:14:13] because I am his attribute.
[1:14:15] [Music]
[1:14:17] I am a part of him.
[1:14:20] Without me, he is not full because he's
[1:14:24] the head.
[1:14:26] I am the body and him and I make God.
[1:14:32] Hallelujah.
[1:14:34] Amen. Amen. We may not understand this
[1:14:36] right now
[1:14:39] because we are wearing the flesh,
[1:14:41] but one of these days now. Hallelujah.
[1:14:44] Amen. When the trumpet of the Lord shall
[1:14:46] come, you will know what I'm talking
[1:14:48] about, you will see the living room,
[1:14:53] of the love of God,
[1:14:57] of this fellowship divine.
[1:15:01] Praise God.
[1:15:04] And henceforth you see he prepared for
[1:15:06] the sake of the elect.
[1:15:09] And now he begins to talk about the
[1:15:11] elect.
[1:15:13] And he says elect
[1:15:15] cannot
[1:15:17] persecute elect.
[1:15:23] Hallelujah. The moment you have someone,
[1:15:26] maybe a brother in your church that you
[1:15:29] don't like and you you wish something
[1:15:32] bad happened to them.
[1:15:35] I wish they bewitch them. I wish they
[1:15:38] fail exam.
[1:15:39] I wish they lose their job. I wish they
[1:15:42] never become friends. I wish they never
[1:15:44] get married.
[1:15:46] And you are thinking you are an elect.
[1:15:51] There's a problem. And let me announce
[1:15:54] to you either none of you is an ill
[1:15:58] or you that is hurting is the one who is
[1:16:04] but I can assure you
[1:16:06] can never persecute.
[1:16:08] [Music]
[1:16:10] Hallelujah. An elect can never have
[1:16:13] hatred.
[1:16:14] Can never have hatred but he will always
[1:16:16] have love.
[1:16:18] Hallelujah.
[1:16:20] Amen. Elect cannot harm elect.
[1:16:26] It is the reproets.
[1:16:32] Hallelujah. It is the reproets
[1:16:35] that persecute and destroy the elect.
[1:16:42] Look, look at Esau. He's hunting Jacob
[1:16:47] to destroy him. Who is
[1:16:51] Serpent seed.
[1:16:54] &gt;&gt; Look at Cain. He's hunting
[1:16:58] and he finally destroys it. Who is Kane?
[1:17:01] Serpent seed.
[1:17:03] Amen. Look at Judas is hunting Jesus
[1:17:08] cunningly
[1:17:10] in the eyes of being a brother.
[1:17:14] You know, look at all the examples I've
[1:17:16] given you.
[1:17:18] Pain was a brother of Ab.
[1:17:21] Isa was a brother of Jesus.
[1:17:23] Even Judas was a brother of Jesus. But
[1:17:26] all of these ones being brothers, one of
[1:17:30] them was a elect,
[1:17:32] another one was a reprobate.
[1:17:34] And the reprobates will always hunt the
[1:17:37] elect.
[1:17:42] Oh my god. But the elect
[1:17:46] will have an open arm.
[1:17:50] An open hand, an open heart.
[1:17:54] Brother Bam said when they draw a small
[1:17:57] circle
[1:17:59] and they draw you out,
[1:18:02] you the elect, you will draw a bigger
[1:18:04] one
[1:18:07] and you will draw everybody in.
[1:18:12] That is why we are not a denomination.
[1:18:16] Hallelujah. Amen. We are not Catholics.
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:26] But I will tell you what, we welcome all
[1:18:29] of them here.
[1:18:32] They are our brothers. We love them.
[1:18:36] Why? Because we want them to receive
[1:18:38] this message of God.
[1:18:42] Amen. The elect will be in love with the
[1:18:45] world.
[1:18:50] Praise God.
[1:18:52] All those reprobates
[1:18:55] are religious.
[1:18:57] They are smart.
[1:19:01] They are of that cane line.
[1:19:04] The serpent sea. They build their
[1:19:07] bubbles.
[1:19:10] They build their cities.
[1:19:12] They build their empires.
[1:19:15] And all the while calling on God,
[1:19:18] they had the true seed and they will do
[1:19:21] all they can
[1:19:24] even in the name of the Lord to destroy
[1:19:27] God's elected ones.
[1:19:30] But they are needed.
[1:19:32] They are needed.
[1:19:34] We need them. What is the chaff to the
[1:19:37] wheat?
[1:19:40] No chaff, no wheat.
[1:19:43] But at the end
[1:19:45] What happens to the ch?
[1:19:48] It is burned with a fire and
[1:19:51] what about the wheat? Where is it? It is
[1:19:55] gathered in his garden.
[1:19:57] It is where he is.
[1:20:00] You are the wheat. We are preparing
[1:20:02] ourselves to be gathered into the garden
[1:20:07] in the rapture,
[1:20:09] the change of our bodies.
[1:20:12] And you know there is one thing that
[1:20:15] brother Bam said will be the way uh will
[1:20:20] be the thing that will help the seed to
[1:20:21] overcome
[1:20:25] is when she realizes
[1:20:28] and by God's spirit design
[1:20:33] this wrong spirit
[1:20:35] the antichrist spirit
[1:20:38] that is working within the framework of
[1:20:39] Christian
[1:20:42] and she will withstand it,
[1:20:47] then she will be an invisible.
[1:20:52] And it says the book of Revelation
[1:20:56] shows
[1:20:58] the the works of Satan,
[1:21:02] which is the attempted destruction of
[1:21:04] God's.
[1:21:09] and his children
[1:21:12] are alive.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; The children of Satan, by the way, are
[1:21:16] not dead.
[1:21:20] Even Satan is not is not dead.
[1:21:23] He's alive. He's on earth today.
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:29] He's a spirit of deception
[1:21:32] in our generation. He has come to us as
[1:21:35] a pale horse rider.
[1:21:41] All of it mixed together,
[1:21:44] deception, death,
[1:21:47] persecution,
[1:21:48] and is coming to attack the bride.
[1:21:51] And you know what? He has made his
[1:21:54] preachers,
[1:21:56] ministers of righteousness.
[1:22:00] So there are people wearing suits today
[1:22:04] just like me when they are children of
[1:22:07] Satan
[1:22:10] and they're reading from the Bible
[1:22:12] they're just like Cain they are brother
[1:22:17] and their work is only one to build a
[1:22:21] big bell
[1:22:24] to build a big city
[1:22:26] to build a big empire
[1:22:29] while calling on God. They are very
[1:22:31] smart. They are trying to build a very
[1:22:35] big religious city.
[1:22:41] But the purpose is one.
[1:22:45] Open your eyes. The purpose is one to
[1:22:49] destroy the elect.
[1:22:52] What is the purpose of the World Council
[1:22:54] of Churches?
[1:22:58] The Bible calls in the image of the
[1:23:00] beast.
[1:23:04] What is their purpose?
[1:23:06] You know the whole purpose is one.
[1:23:08] They're bundling themselves together.
[1:23:11] We know for one purpose
[1:23:14] that they may destroy the true church
[1:23:19] because they will have one voice,
[1:23:22] one world religion
[1:23:25] and then they will fight against
[1:23:28] that lead church
[1:23:31] that does not have membership
[1:23:34] in their organization.
[1:23:39] But I don't know what Amen. That the
[1:23:41] elect can never be destroyed.
[1:23:45] Where do they go? They go in the rapture
[1:23:48] because we in this end time
[1:23:51] are anointed
[1:23:53] with the anointing of the flying eagle,
[1:23:58] the flying eagle.
[1:24:00] Go and read your Bible. Four beasts. And
[1:24:04] the last beast to come is a flying
[1:24:07] eagle.
[1:24:08] You know we are not flying to escape.
[1:24:13] Some people think we are escaping.
[1:24:16] We are not escaping anything.
[1:24:19] We are flying away because we have
[1:24:22] overcome.
[1:24:25] Amen. We are flying away because we have
[1:24:27] defeated the Lord and all his works and
[1:24:32] all his tactics.
[1:24:34] That's why we are against denomination.
[1:24:38] The spirit of denomination, the spirit
[1:24:40] of religion because it comes to destroy
[1:24:42] the healer.
[1:24:45] God did not send us religion.
[1:24:47] He sent us the word but man turned it
[1:24:51] into religion.
[1:24:53] Religion is the highest, the greatest
[1:24:55] enemy of the church,
[1:24:58] organized religion.
[1:25:01] God has separated us from all.
[1:25:04] But you know we have no hatred in our
[1:25:06] heart.
[1:25:08] We love everybody
[1:25:11] even those that are not part of us
[1:25:15] because the why do they form
[1:25:16] denominations
[1:25:18] they said we are the right ones others
[1:25:21] are wrong and they our enemies the
[1:25:24] moment they do that says they die
[1:25:29] they die and they kept on doing that
[1:25:32] forming all denominations
[1:25:35] but you see The moment you begin to feel
[1:25:39] we are the only right one, everybody
[1:25:41] else is wrong
[1:25:44] and our enemies.
[1:25:46] That's the the dividing line.
[1:25:51] You have now made yourself a
[1:25:52] denomination.
[1:25:54] But this message was not intended to
[1:25:56] build a denomination.
[1:25:59] [Music]
[1:26:01] Right? You see, we have many churches of
[1:26:04] the message all over the world.
[1:26:07] many different registrations.
[1:26:10] Our registrations is not an issue.
[1:26:15] Those things are for the government.
[1:26:18] It's not for our identity.
[1:26:22] What identifies all of us
[1:26:25] is the message we all feed on.
[1:26:29] The word we all feed on
[1:26:31] that identifies us in Christ.
[1:26:35] The Holy Ghost which we are baptized
[1:26:36] with
[1:26:40] that identifies us
[1:26:42] and we are we are not a denomination
[1:26:45] and we cannot be
[1:26:48] praise God
[1:26:52] firstians 4
[1:26:55] but as touching brotherly love
[1:26:59] ye need not that I write unto you for ye
[1:27:01] yourselves a taught of God to love one
[1:27:03] another.
[1:27:07] 1 Peter 1:22,
[1:27:09] "Seeing you have priified your souls in
[1:27:11] obeying the truth through the spirit
[1:27:12] unto unf
[1:27:18] of the brethren.
[1:27:20] See that ye love one another
[1:27:23] with a pure heart fervently,
[1:27:27] being born again,
[1:27:30] not of corruptible seed,
[1:27:33] but of incorruptible
[1:27:35] by the word of God,
[1:27:38] which liveth and abideth forever.
[1:27:43] Praise God.
[1:27:45] 1 John 3:23.
[1:27:48] And this is his commandment.
[1:27:50] that we should believe on the name of
[1:27:52] his son Jesus Christ
[1:27:55] and love one another as he gave us
[1:27:58] commandments.
[1:28:00] 1 John 4:7
[1:28:02] beloved
[1:28:04] let us love one another
[1:28:06] for love is of God
[1:28:09] and everyone that loveth
[1:28:12] is born of God
[1:28:15] and knoweth God.
[1:28:18] He that loveth not
[1:28:21] knoweth not God,
[1:28:23] for God is love.
[1:28:25] And it is who has manifested the love of
[1:28:28] God toward us
[1:28:32] because that God sent his only begotten
[1:28:34] son into the world
[1:28:36] that we might live through him.
[1:28:39] Heroin is love.
[1:28:42] Not that we loved God,
[1:28:45] but that he loved us.
[1:28:48] Hallelujah.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; We were the bad one
[1:28:52] and he being good, he loved us.
[1:28:56] But now that he has loved us,
[1:29:00] he has been born in us.
[1:29:04] That's why we born again,
[1:29:06] born of God, not born of the flesh.
[1:29:10] We are now no longer what we were we
[1:29:12] were before he came.
[1:29:16] We are now born of God. So now we are
[1:29:20] him.
[1:29:21] So the way he loved us, we didn't love
[1:29:24] him. He loved us. So the same same way,
[1:29:30] we that were loved by him
[1:29:34] can now love others
[1:29:38] even when they don't love us.
[1:29:42] Hallelujah. Here is love.
[1:29:46] Not that we loved him, but that he loved
[1:29:49] us and sent his son to be properation of
[1:29:53] our sins.
[1:29:56] Beloved, if God so loved us,
[1:30:00] we ought also to love one another.
[1:30:05] Praise God.
[1:30:10] and their eyes were open and they knew
[1:30:11] him.
[1:30:13] Let me tell you, just don't join church
[1:30:15] now.
[1:30:17] That won't work. You've got to be born
[1:30:20] again.
[1:30:22] Not an emotional workup.
[1:30:26] Not some little something you say,
[1:30:29] "Oh, well, I shouted I spoke with
[1:30:33] that ain't it."
[1:30:35] When really down in your heart something
[1:30:37] comes to change you
[1:30:41] and you become a new creature in Christ
[1:30:44] Jesus.
[1:30:46] You received the person
[1:30:51] Christ Jesus
[1:30:53] when old things die out
[1:30:56] and new things are born again.
[1:30:59] You make things right
[1:31:02] that you did wrong.
[1:31:05] You love your enemies. You pray for
[1:31:07] those who respect you. That's when you
[1:31:10] are a Christian.
[1:31:12] The tree is known by the fruit it bears.
[1:31:16] [Music]
[1:31:23] And he says in here him, I don't care if
[1:31:25] you are a church member.
[1:31:28] Don't be ashamed. Church member is all
[1:31:31] right.
[1:31:33] But brother, that's not what we talking
[1:31:34] about.
[1:31:36] Have you really received something in
[1:31:37] your heart
[1:31:40] that makes you love everybody?
[1:31:44] Okay, I'm about to finish and listen to
[1:31:45] those words.
[1:31:48] Have you you you
[1:31:52] received something in your heart
[1:31:55] that makes you love everybody?
[1:32:00] Listen. Love your enemies.
[1:32:07] All all the old things
[1:32:11] this person you become.
[1:32:15] Some of you are saying, "All things are
[1:32:16] passed.
[1:32:19] I'm now new. I'm born again. I'm a part
[1:32:22] of my savior."
[1:32:24] But yet your heart is filled with a lot
[1:32:29] of hatred,
[1:32:31] with a lot of envy,
[1:32:33] with a lot of gossip,
[1:32:35] wi-i with a lot of bitterness.
[1:32:38] You are lying yourself.
[1:32:40] You are not yet new.
[1:32:43] you are old.
[1:32:45] Would you stand your feet now
[1:32:50] for prayer?
[1:32:52] And that's what Brahos said,
[1:32:54] which means it is possible for you to
[1:32:58] truly be born again
[1:33:02] and you receive true pure love.
[1:33:07] Love that workketh no ill to his name.
[1:33:12] And he says that love is the fulfilling
[1:33:15] of the Lord.
[1:33:18] Hallelujah.
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:33:31] Let me just try to wrap it up now.
[1:33:34] I I wanted to speak on Peter.
[1:33:38] I spoke a little bit on it on Sunday.
[1:33:41] How it tells us about the state of a
[1:33:44] perfect man
[1:33:48] and brother Bam says building this
[1:33:50] monument
[1:33:52] building this sture
[1:33:54] starts off with the foundation of stone
[1:33:57] faith
[1:33:59] virtue knowledge patience godliness
[1:34:04] now what does it do then they are
[1:34:06] waiting for the headstone
[1:34:10] which is love. For God is love and he
[1:34:13] controls and he is the strength of every
[1:34:15] one of those things
[1:34:20] right in here.
[1:34:22] See all those works in here.
[1:34:26] And here these little waves come. What
[1:34:29] is that?
[1:34:31] The Holy Ghost coming down.
[1:34:35] Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is above
[1:34:37] all this.
[1:34:40] welding this together.
[1:34:42] Building what? A perfect church
[1:34:47] for the capstone to capital.
[1:34:51] [Music]
[1:34:54] And this capstone what we are preaching
[1:34:56] to you is the capstone message.
[1:35:04] The message of the seven thunders
[1:35:08] which is the capstone message.
[1:35:13] What is it? It is the revelation of
[1:35:15] Jesus
[1:35:19] which gives you
[1:35:22] not only rapturing faith
[1:35:26] but kepts you off as a perfect church.
[1:35:36] with Christ the head
[1:35:39] perfect love
[1:35:41] sitting on it.
[1:35:44] Praise God.
[1:35:46] Let me tell you friends.
[1:35:49] When you when you study this subject of
[1:35:52] love,
[1:35:55] it makes you wonder whether many of us
[1:35:57] have yet gotten there.
[1:36:02] Someone can preach for I don't know how
[1:36:04] many years
[1:36:06] but not yet there.
[1:36:09] But when he comes is going to only
[1:36:12] attract the substance that is like him.
[1:36:20] Can you disagree with somebody
[1:36:24] and you love them genuine?
[1:36:29] Can someone abuse you
[1:36:32] despitefully use you
[1:36:35] and you still love them?
[1:36:39] How come we have all these attitudes
[1:36:42] as a believer? You you have those
[1:36:44] attitudes
[1:36:46] and you say that one
[1:36:51] we will never work together again
[1:36:54] we don't see you that one
[1:36:58] sir
[1:37:00] blacklisted there is a problem with you
[1:37:04] not with them
[1:37:06] and if a problem is not with the seed
[1:37:10] then you're just not born again
[1:37:14] But I want to believe they're just not
[1:37:15] born again.
[1:37:19] But you see, Bible says, "Ask and ye
[1:37:22] shall be given. Knock, it shall be
[1:37:24] opened." If you want to be born again,
[1:37:28] it is very easy.
[1:37:30] Be born of the word. Be born of the
[1:37:33] spirit. When you receive the word, he
[1:37:36] will fill you with the spirit in your
[1:37:37] heart. And how do you know that? When
[1:37:41] you have divine love,
[1:37:45] that one cannot fail.
[1:37:49] If you can stand on your feet, it will
[1:37:51] the Bible says it beareth all things,
[1:37:56] believeth all things, endureth all
[1:38:00] things,
[1:38:02] not easily performed, thinkketh no evil,
[1:38:06] doesn't rejoice in iniquity,
[1:38:08] rejoices in in the truth, it is not
[1:38:11] self-seeking,
[1:38:13] is not puffed up,
[1:38:15] doesn't supposed to vault itself.
[1:38:18] No envy in it, is kind and
[1:38:21] long-suffering,
[1:38:23] doesn't behave itself unseemly.
[1:38:29] Would you ask bow your head tonight?
[1:38:33] And you know speak to the Lord. Tell him
[1:38:35] Lord.
[1:38:37] I need that.
[1:38:39] I need that for my brothers
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:43] that I will love my brothers. That I
[1:38:46] will love my sisters.
[1:38:49] That I will love my enemies.
[1:38:52] The Lord Jesus.
[1:38:55] When people see me, when men see me,
[1:38:59] then they will know I am his disciple.
[1:39:04] That's the only way they can know.
[1:39:07] Not by so much prayer,
[1:39:10] not by so much shouting or rejoicing
[1:39:15] or being religious,
[1:39:17] [Music]
[1:39:18] but by love.
[1:39:20] The love that never fails.
[1:39:23] Conditions can't fail.
[1:39:25] situations can't fail it.
[1:39:28] That love will remain perfect.
[1:39:31] It cannot be.
[1:39:34] It's like a rock. It stays for ages.
[1:39:39] Lord Jesus. May you give that to my
[1:39:42] brother, my sister.
[1:39:44] May you make this a living reality
[1:39:48] to each one of us, Lord.
[1:39:50] And we may come to that place
[1:39:53] that whereby we can say
[1:39:55] we love everybody.
[1:39:58] We love our brothers.
[1:40:00] We love our sisters
[1:40:02] and we have no enemies
[1:40:05] by the devil.
[1:40:08] Lord, I know that these things
[1:40:11] cannot be able to be attained
[1:40:14] humanly speaking.
[1:40:18] But if you can give us a new path,
[1:40:22] bring us to that level, Lord, of
[1:40:25] perfection
[1:40:27] that we may know. It's not about us.
[1:40:31] It's about Christ.
[1:40:33] It's all about you.
[1:40:35] Granted, I pray. Bless everyone that has
[1:40:38] been listening
[1:40:40] and all the saints on Zoom tonight,
[1:40:43] also here, and elsewhere. Father, bless
[1:40:46] each and every one of us. In the name of
