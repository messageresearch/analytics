with the word of God Amen I wonder the deacons I'm seeing some other meetings happening there I just have a few comments to make and then after that we will get into the word this morning uh I see brother Joel from Miana God bless you uh they they left the report for me to read this morning I don't know why I begin with that perhaps there was a miscommunication uh we have uh contributions from um Paul 45,000 IRAs 100,000s Martin 40,000 57,000 Martin Luther 88,000 John wileyy 41,000 williiam Bram Willam 128,000 amen and this brings a brings it to a total of um 699,000 for the month the 20th week uh is there anyone who is and is not part of the teams that I don't know if there is any if you can lift up your hand okay several okay I just wanted them to lift up their hand so that the team leaders can see them and then they will go to them and talk to them so we have divided the church into seven groups contribute weekly towards the land fund of the [Music] church and by God's grace we've been able to do that for now the past 20 weeks and for the past 20 weeks we have 18 million 87,000 for just 20 weeks amen uh but this week we have a brother a brother is Brother Joseph here ah oh brother this is Brother Joseph so his brother his elder brother called St he contacted me a few weeks ago and he told me my brother told me about what is going on at the church there and I'm intending to contribute I'm intending to be contributing so he said I would like to begin uh contributing I think he told me about two weeks ago but things did not go well for him so he told me I'm sorry but I I I I'll make it up so this week I think yesterday the other day he sent on our church account of 1 million shs amen and he said that is just the beginning so I think we should be happy for that so um you have brothers you have friends we are not able to do this alone let us involve the others if for sure we believe that this is going to happen let us involve our brothers our relatives friends or co-workers you know you have some of your co-workers that are your bosses others are are doing quite well financially the wealth of the world is all the Lord so let us talk to them tell them you know what we are doing some funis church if you can join our group or if you can just give me something weekly or just something you know one time and the Lord will bless you many people want are looking for where to to put their money to serve God but they don't know if there are still churches that preach the truth you are an ambassador you can tell them give them an opportunity and that will be a blessing to you and to them omet I'm happy to see you amen I'm sure you have your friends there who are some of them are generals talk to them surpr you be praise God our brother is an army officer so now we see um we we have a total to so this this week now it brings that to 1.6 Millions 1.69 million so for an overall total that we now currently have in all our contributions including the other weeks that we did we were contributing before we started uh this weekly and what we have contributed for these weeks we have a total sum of 55 million 879 I think we should give AAP of PR amen amen praise God well I believe that we are headed somewhere and I would like to really appreciate the team leaders who have tirelessly continued to encourage their team members the Lord will surely bless you you know we have start we started this thing to finish it the way still seems we looking for 200 million shs so that means we have reached a quarter is it a quarter so we are headed somewhere and the Lord shall do it tell your neighbor the Lord we amen receive greetings from Sister Rose she's not able to be with us she Trav to Tanzania for business and I think should be back in this week also receive greetings from Brother Brian a brother that lost his child he told me they returned from the barrier and he gave me some good news well of course he was going to come but they couldn't come because he and his wife got red eyes I think they're streaming this morning um now brother Brian gave me some good news one of his V um neighbors him to the barri and the brother who preached the barrier the funeral service uh preached preached a message that um sparked off this man's heart they believed this message now not only that but before they traveled back from the bar that man was baptized in the name of our so you see God is able to make a trial a blessing if it will take him to take a life of the innocent he will do it to redeem a soul well of course the innocent we know that they go to heaven and so it's Double L to the enemy praise the name of the Lord amen and this morning I also wanted to announce that um we is the sixth month and so we are now um usually in this around the end of this month we begin to uh prepare for our youth meetings 2025 Youth Camp is up is coming we just have six month away how many are expected amen you don't look like you're expected how many I really expect expectation well I believe that the Lord has great things prepared for us H the the news I have to announce to you this morning is that God had your prayers I think about two three weeks ago I told you to pray for our guest God had laid on my heart to invite and um so this morning I would like to say they have all confirmed now one of the brothers I invited is an elder in this message he has a really Dynamic Ministry which I believe is going to be a very of a very immense blessing to all the young people that will come but something happened brother Joseph chosi from from the UK um he he of course I visited his work his churches in Zimbabwe this brother is an apostle God has helped him to start many churches one of the elders in Zimbabwe and so I got an opportunity to visit one of the okay his first church in m and also in um and um of course these churches now have other pastors but still oversees the work for him he now moved to the UK and uh he has another church there which is uh when I I I've been praying about it for a while so when I contacted him when I felt the time was right I contacted him and by email and told him about the meetings and um he said right now I'm I think he was at the airport or something like that he was traveling to Zimbabwe he said I'll let you know I'll give you feedback contact me next week so that was I think this week so I I contacted him this week and I received a response he said I've confirmed come to the meeting but here is what I wanted you to see as soon as I responded to that message uh Pastor Leo sent me message with a of completely dismantled and with a message on it saying Pastor Joseph CH has been involved in a a terrible car head on car accident with a driver who did not have lights and uh so he said that you know so the message but he said he's in the hospital I believe I've just I've just answered his email which has just sent me you know I I realized he answered that email when he was at the hospital bed after that and that's when I get the response so I had to call one of his sons ask him is this true he said yes it is true and later on um Pastor Joseph sent me this message which I thought I should share with you because I found it to be a very Supernatural evil he said I am well I do not know how I escaped that that remains a paradox that is the closest I have been to death it it had to be only God I think I must have died for about five or so minutes I do not recall even how I was pulled out I only gained Consciousness after they stood me up after the rescue no bone was broken amen the Bible says he will protect them that even no B will be broken I'm still in hospital but I am I'm I'm St I have some pain and discomfort from a cut on the top of my head which should have killed me that cut it was a head on collision with a car without lights and my car rolled three times and landed on the roof I thank God for sparing my life you may think this is a coincidence I just invite him and then this happens I said it's not a coincidence the devil was angry I believe he did not want him to come now the devil is going to see what will happen because this man who just survived death has confirmed coming to speak to our and I believe that the devil will not hinder the will of God so we have a brother Joseph coming also our brother Wayne Lawson Wayne from from the USA he a wonderful uh uh speaker he's been speaking at several youth camps in in in Europe in Canada in America is a pastor in the US I met him when I was in swizerland I believe his ministry will be a blessing and also a brother called Andrew Glover so it's going to be a full pack I believe God is going to move in those youth meetings so we will send out the we'll begin doing the invitations and everything after we have had our first meeting we still have a few things to confirm with some service providers because I we are intending to have there's a school uh called Britain it's close to pan so we are in talks with them once they give us accommodation then now we can send out the the invitations so probably beginning of next month hallelujah hallelujah amen shall we stand on our feet there are some brothers people who wanted to be baptized if they are available in the evening today we shall have a baptism service but after the service we are going to have maybe a few Brothers brother brother martin if you could please stay back and we have some meeting Amen Let us just see my H is in the Lord amen is brother Peter here no okay okay

said shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you what's what what things soever you desire When you pray believe that ye receive them and he shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if ye have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive your [Music] trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen may you be seated may the Lord bless us as we hear his word so now Saints this morning I'm speaking to you on forgiveness forgiveness so this is a little pastoral message I do not intend to even be very long on it but I would like you to really give me your undivided attention step put as much as you can the Lord will bless you for that so now we see here that Jesus gives this little teaching to the uh to the disciples and he says that uh uh whatsoever whosoever that shall set to this mountain be there removed and be cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall be believe those things which he has said it shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he [Music] sayth therefore I say unto you whatever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and he shall have them now I want to say this many of you have prayed and have asked God to do things in your life and God has not done it I would like to inform you this morning one of the reasons why is because in your heart you do not have forgiveness because faith is on the um uh faith is on the basis of forgiveness it sounds so good when you you're commanding a mountain and a mountain is removed from one place to another it sounds so good you know when you want something and you ask God and God provides it to you it sounds like so so that we have so much power but listen to me that he says when you start praying forgive so other words before you even begin praying you should forgive if you do not forgive he says your heavenly father will also not forgive your trespasses now we have so many people who claim to be Believers but in their heart they so filled with unforgiveness and and with a lot of things that even when they pray God canot accept their sacrifice you know they are hypocrites they Pharisees in their hearts but you know a Christian is supposed to be a person with a clean heart and we are supposed to stand pure in our mind and in our conscious in our approach to God because God answers prayer you believe God answers prayer how many God answ prayer say amen he answers prayer but why is it that so many of our prayers go and answer because we stand praying but with a heart full of gu but with a heart full of hatred with a heart full of unforgiveness with a heart full of Revenge a prophet in the message perfect Faith he says now faith is based on forgiveness tell your neighbor faith is best on forgiv so in other words you cannot you are faith cannot be put to work if you don't forgive no mountain will be removed at your prayer if you do not forgive you know you will speak to a mountain and a mountain will remain right there because in your heart you do not have forgiveness faith is based on forgiveness and then as we said this morning trying to get the church into the place to where we could really see the apostolic times moving Among Us that is what we all H for how many Hunger for that where you see the power of God moving where you see signs and wonders where you see moving where you see happen I don't know about you but really I I don't like this Gospel of just Doctrine and teaching but no power no moving of the Holy Ghost you know in my heart I Longing For the Dynamics I long for the Dynamics I long for the move of the Holy Ghost I long for healing to happen long for miracles to like the testimony we had here brother g i so happy when you come to a church and you have no job and you hear a brother testifying prayed for me and God gave me a job are you not so happy when you hear things like then you feel you are encouraged in your faith to also believe if God did it for them he will do it for me we want those Apostolic times to be among that's what we all hunger for and he says and it's just laying right at the door that power is right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it oh I want more we want it such we want it such a flow that it will be a help to us to flow out to others that can't happen without faith without faith it is impossible to please God you need Faith to move your Mountain you need Faith to make things happen in your life you need Faith to overcome demons and spirits that are are troubling you you need to move from the place where you are to the place where God wants you you need Faith to overcome your enemies you need Faith to overcome your your troubles faith it is impossible to please God but here he says faith is based on forgiveness so in other words if you do not forgive you stand in a place where you might actually have faith that faith is deactivated the power that activates your faith forgiveness if your heart is filled with bitterness if your heart is filled with hatred if your heart is filled with malice if your heart is filled with Envy are you hearing me if your heart is filled with jealousy then you you cannot forgive and if you cannot forgive you are going to be prayer you are praying comes back again to you it just comes back against you you have no access there is no entrance minister to you to reach the holy of holies because in your heart you have no you have no forgiveness what is forgiveness according to the dictionary forgiveness is find as a deliberate decision a deliberate decision to release feelings of resentment you decide on your own deliberately with an intention to release feelings of resentment of vengance toward a person or a group who has offended you regardless of whether they actually deserve your forgiveness now you have many believers who will come up and say I won't forgive them they have to come and repent and cry and SN and fall down and give me that actually in our cultures here in Africa for you to be forgiven there are certain prerequisites you have to fulfill if you have offended one you saw there was this man here in Uganda that that you know shot and killed a man and you know I Nally survived that man his name is and and and you know he he killed killed a man because that man you know reversed and and and knocked his car so there so he got out and shot him now I remember the same same thing happened between me and that man so I came out and asked him I said for and and you know because long story short I was just entering the mall and I was you know I had people making noise and I thought oh have I knocked a child so I quickly reversed and then I did not know that he was also coming and so I bumped into him and so when I came out I said forgive me he spoke very many Val words there and he said I cannot forgive I can't speak those words and he said you have to repair my he took me to Toyota Uganda and when I reached there he said you have to commit write a letter here you have to commit to everything and all the money I had in my life I spent it on his I'll never forget that day but did I forgive him surely I did forgive him did he forgive me I do not know but I doubt and the same same thing happened between him and another man shot him and now the family of that man said it has been the trending on the news how many have seen those news family said well for you for us to forgive you know you have to come and you bring I don't know how many bulls you know KNE down and this and do that and this is culture this is what it requires for a person to be for and you find that those kind of things also come down into the hearts of Christians Believers for me to forgive me I will never forgive you find a brother a sister me I will never forgive that person what they did to me I will I will never forgive and he's a brother he a sister speak like and others will be like if you want me to forgive you you have to come and leak my my my feet otherwise I I swear I will never forgive those words are coming out of what kind of heart I can almost tell you they are not coming out of the heart that is clean and filled with the Holy Ghost amen if you can't say Amen it means you have that kind of heart are coming out of bitterness those are coming out of Vengeance the spirit of Vengeance you have done this to me I need to do this to you that's why people bewi others that's why people hate other you find someone hting someone with passion and when someone hats another one they even recruit others to H on their behalf you know can you imagine what that person did to me oh I can't even think about it whenever I think about I feel like going to them squeezing their neck but because I'm a Believer I forgave him you are lying you did not forgive them that is why you filled with bitterness you're filled with anger you need to receive a baptism of the Holy Ghost that it will bring you forgiveness in your soul in your that God will change you because if you don't forgive your faith will always be inactive whatever you do for the Lord you will never please him praise the name of the Lord and so there are three elements of forgiveness number one it has to be a deliberate action an intentional action you cannot forgive by accident no you can't you don't forgive someone because they have braed you you do something to somebody and they angry with you but then when you give them money they forgive you that's not forgiveness that's not forgiveness if you are going to forgive somebody it is a deliberate action you to release and dismiss feelings of resentment regard and also the other element is that forgiveness is usually done or given by the offended are you following me church are you following me Church forgiveness is usually given by the offended you didn't hear me that's why you didn't say Amen on forgiveness you hear many people say how do you tell me to forgive them they are the ones who did this thing to me they must come do ab then I forgive them no you have to forgive because you are offended now you tell me that is hard that is Christianity if it is hard for you then you have never been a Christian the offend and the other the other third element of forgiveness is that the offender does not have to deserve it first there is none of us that deserves forgiveness whoever offends another and offends them and make feel B it means that the other person they offended he has no justification all bis to begin to forgive that [Applause] person what you are telling me to forgive that person do you know what they have done to me do you know if you knew what they have done to me you would not be telling me to forgive no no I cannot so tell me who has done work that deserves to be forgiven are there small offenses and big offenses every offense is Big to the person who has been offended if you have been ever been offended lift up your hand as that offense was it small to you it changed your heart and the way you were looking at the person who offended you it made you feel bad about life it made you feel bad about yourself sometimes it made you feel like you are used by the person who has offended you but let me tell you the other element of forgiveness is that the offender usually doesn't have to deserve forgiveness but you deliberately you make up your mind and you decide release and dismiss feelings of resentment and hat and and you decide to give them the offender the one that doesn't deserve it you decide on your own to give them forgiveness hallelujah amen if we want to understand forgiveness we we can look at the Forgiveness we all have in Christ siners were fully released from God is just penalty all charges against us were dropped were dismissed all charges were all of them were dropped who deserved it none of us deserve his forgiveness we were so lost we were so undone amen but he decided to take it upon himself and forgive us we the ones that did not deserve it we the ones that deserved h but God the Bible says but God who was so rich in Mery he decided amen according to his own will amen we never begged him for it we never asked him for it but he decided according to the counil of his own will to deliberately forgive you deliberately dismiss all the Hallelujah glory to God Amen and that's what forgiveness is Romans 81 says let now that's what I said but now we want to see what he himself says about your charges the Bible says we are all born in sin all Sheed in iniquity we come to the speaking L if you deserve forgiveness pleas forgiveness raise up your hand none of us you deserve forgiveness brother come up here brother this brother feels he deserves forgiveness why do you think you deserve you his forgiveness why do you have a bu a basis of what you have done to deserve forgiveness changed his mind so you actually believe you are so bad that even when he looks at you he should not forgive you but by his Mercy he can forgive you is it what you believe so you just like the rest of us we thought you were special we all the same we are all the same that's what I wanted to show you none of us can stand up and claim I deserve to for I deserve to be forgiven it's just like somebody giving you something and you say I deserved it I deserved it why I worked for him for so long so I deserved it but you know when someone gives you something and and and you you did not know them they did not know you you'll be like why do you give it to me sir because I love you I don't deserve it you would even reject it he would say please take it I decided to give it that's how God has given us forg we did not deserve it there is nothing we have done there is nothing we can do to receive his forgiveness to deserve it is all by Grace Hallelujah and he in his own word this is what it says to us Romans 81 there is there for now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the Bible says that Satan is the accuser of the Brethren is the accuser he goes to God and he tells God so and so has done such and such but do you know what God the devil does know one thing that God through his Sovereign mercy and grace even though we were so undeserving he took away the condemnation from us and he said that is there for now no condemnation to them which are in regardless of what I did in my life I might have been so filthy I might have done so bad amen maybe even you have mared some maybe you've been in some kind of sin yeah you say m yes it is a sin but even that even fornication even even witchcraft even hatred even gossip all sins and all sins before God are sins there is no small sin and big sin are you hearing me there is no small sin and big sin and we all are Sinners by default by Nature because of our first birth God who is so rich in Mercy oh we never begged for it butam said no man seeks God God who sought after us amen when Adam seen never went out looking for God where are you no it is God he came down because of hisy he came down and he said Adam where are you what was that it was calling what was that was forgiveness for him and when Adam found him he said I've seen father say don't you wor let let the blood of this sheep cover you hallelujah hallelujah God sought after Adam and he gave him forgiveness in the same same way we also who are so wred who are so sinful who are so undone someone even look at you and say you mean you are the one who is claiming to be a Christian you you are talking joing I know you we used to do this together you look at them and tell them I received something in my I don't deserve it I know that by his grace by Mery me of all that is there for now no demn no condemnation to them that are in Christ to them who walk not after the flesh to them who walk after the spirit how many are walking up the spirit there is no condemnation for you there is no condemnation for you hallelujah amen he that the son of man sets free is afraid indeed hallelujah amen I said Hallelujah let me also say this even if you don't feel like you are forgiven does not mean you're not forgiven if you feel like you are not forgiven by God after you repented correctly you have a sp PR say what I'm saying brother if you feel after repenting you are not forgiven by God you have a spirit of Pride you need to repent of the spirit of Pride because who are you to say you are still a sinner who are you to say you are still condemned the authority of his word said you have no amen my goodness Hallelujah Colossians 1:4 in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins I have Redemption brother I have Redemption through his blood Redemption means been brought back Redemption means been taken from the filth SE and have been brought back to the righteousness to the Perfection of the word of God been brought back the image of God been brought back in the likeness of God I am redeemed through his blood I've been forgiven of all my sins that is my testimony that should be your testimony in whom in the Amplified it says in whom we have Redemption because of his sacrifice resulting in the Forgiveness of our and and in the Amplified he continues by saying this and consolation of sin's penalty Hallelujah your sin was so great brother but the blood of Jesus is like magic it's like someone who has a big de and you come to to the person you're supposed to pay he tells you tell him how much he says million but as of now I want to give a declaration you didn't ask me you didn't force me but I declare I've canceled your Deb if you ever been forgiven your debt you know how debt can if it is on your heart on your head sometimes even when you sleep you dream men with machet coming to take take your life why are you not paying imagine you are sleeping in a house you don't have rent you don't even know how you're going to pay and the landlord calls you he says I'm so happy God has blessed me I'm giving you one month free you know how much it feels you know how much weight comes out of your shoulders that's what Jesus's blood did for our sins he canel the penalty of sin we didn't deserve it the penalty was there the penalty of sin is death but the forgive because he forgave us it means he canel the penalty he canel the penalty it is impossible for me to go to hell for the blood ones it is impossible to go yes yes I want you to receive the revelation of is impossible when we are preaching to you if you are really blood we are not preaching to you so you can survive here the purpose of this message is not to make us survive H we have already survived here by the death of Jesus on the cross are you hearing me I cannot go to hell it is impossible why because the blood was shed for me to go to hell it means the blood was valueless but the blood was already sh and this Blood B something if you have money and you work into a shop you've gone to buy something I have a question for you what is of more value the thing you're going to buy or the price you have to pay for what is of more value come on answer me now what is of more value what you're going to buy you have revelation God bless you what you going to buy has more value someone did not even receive that Revelation but someone is is about to get it if you go to a shop my brother to buy something it means you are willing to give away something for this one which means what you are getting is of more value to you let me announce let me announce to you this this morning I am more of value than the blood is shed the blood was the price purchased me you are the the you are the purchase the purchase of the blood so in other words you are of more value to [Applause] God anything in the world how can he lose you after paying a price I cannot go to hell because I am the purchase of the Hallelujah when you receive that Revelation it will make youer on top of your voice amen because you know who you are I am the purchase of the blood that's why brother sister you should respect one another you should forgive one another why because God knows you are of value to him and your brother is of to him praise the name of the Lord and we must follow Christ's example Ephesians 4:31 let all bitterness oh my bitterness and wrath and anger and clor and evil speaking let it be put away from you oh my god what you need to take out of you brother sister is bitterness oh when I say it say say bitterness go bit I put you whatever you want to say let bitterness go let W go leter go Pastor me I'm still angry I'm angry over how could he do that how could she do that let it go tell your neighbor Let It Go Let It Go and evil speaking let never open your mouth to speak evil of a brother or a sister don't do that don't do that because the price wasid and all malice be ye kind one to another be tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven that is what we are expected to have I don't care who you are you might be a deacon you might be a pastor you might be a preacher you might be a sister or a brother if you don't forgive you've not found God yet one way to know a Christian two chrisan who is converted is somebody who forgives easily amen do I have people who support that yes even if you feel like you did not forgive before just help me to say Amen so that we can R this demon of unforgiveness by by by by your amen you are saying away with anger with bitterness you find a brother with bitterness a sister with bitterness with wrath with anger with clamor with evil speaking with malice and all those things are in your heart it is sitting on you like a and you are quiet and you are saying you're a brother you come to greet a brother you can't even look at them because you don't like them you have a lot of bitterness about them did something to you you come to them and say God bless you but in your heart I wish I you but you know you've never found God the Bible says Be Kind one to another be tendered be tend be forgiv one another even as Christ has forgiven you in a message as I thought on my way he says what the church needs tonight is a confession and making right to come back to the testimonies of the Lord God there is Mercy there is forgiveness seems that it would have it would haunt people going on know that you are walking hour by hour in the face of death why do we continue on with selfishness any time you can die brother any time you can die sister any time you will be gone you may you are here today but you may not be here tomorrow we are walking right in the face of death so why do you continue the selfishness why do you continue with greed why do you continue with ungodliness and he says our eyes on things of the world it is time we turn back to God's test hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah forgiveness listen to me Saints listen forgiveness is a demonstration of a will is a demonstration of a will not a sure of weakness let me come to you for just a moment many people think that if you forgive someone it means you are weak and they have W I don't know how many have been having that you feel like you are weak and the other person has W and some it is true some people feel that way they play around with somebody they just even when you they can't even repent they can't even confess and you have to force them and eventually they will say okay if if you feel I've done something but forgive me brother you will you be you will answer for that you will answer for that that is the purchase of the blood you're playing with but don't worry if he's a winner don't worry don't worry he may win here but he may not win there but you as a brother you as a sister it is not a show of weakness Christ did not grant us forgiveness because we deserved it we did not deserve it we all have sin and have come short of the glory of God he however deliberately forgave us as a deliberate Act of [Music] Love liberate show of Grace love now when I say that some people feel like oh I want to forgive my Del that's not forgiveness that is sin imorality the you remember what did some brothers are deceived you you are in connection with with a and she keeps trapping you and each time you come up you realize trapped you the Philistines are there and then you realize ah okay I'm forgiven you I'm a Believer next time I forg she's out to take your soul don't twist what I'm preaching today the Forgiveness I'm preaching about is you not having bitterness in your heart against someone who has truly offended you despite our sins he forgave us now I'd like us to look at John 19:3 he says when Jesus had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the now Jesus said it is finished Jesus knew what was finished Jesus fully paid our de of sin the word it is finished here symbolizes all our sins all our trespasses all our iniquities all our transgressions are permanently erased without in Psalms chapter 1 103:2 he says as far as the East is from the West so far has he removed our transgressions amen our transgressions from us he has removed our transgression when he said it is finished he taken our transgressions by the neck and he pull it away as far as is is from the W oh my what savior savior he took our sins far from us as a matter of fact a prophet says in In Living dying burried Rising coming he says when anything is bured it is hid it is out of sight and he carried my sins far away God can see our sins no more so they are buried I'm talking about you who has repented and confessed before him your sins areed your sins God cannot see them no more you ask me is God blind yeah God Is Blind to one thing God Is Blind to confess sin hallelujah amen that is the only thing the devil is better than God the devil can see your sins even when you have confessed them even when you have repented before God the devil can see them but to God he will never see them the moment you confess he can ever see them so the devil will go to him the devil is the accuser so he will go to God and have you seen what he I can't see where is it I can't see what am I talking about God Is Blind to the sins that are under the blood hallelujah amen that's why we say leave your sins for the blood to cover you should confess your sins when you do wrong when you live wrong always come back before God and put yourself right before him never sit comfortably the moment you do that you'll be spiritually dead you find someone who was on fire clapping his hands and saying Amen in the church behaving as if you're power isol they can't even say an amen why because that sin is finishing them God can see it the devil can see it and can see unconfessed sins can be seen by everyone yourself God and the devil but if you confess your sins and you repent of your sins you know what you may still see them you are human the devil will always see them he made you do them but God can't see them Hallelujah someone come to you say you did this oh yes I did because you remember but God doesn't and you will tell them I am no longer the person I used God can see our sins no more for they areed they areed where in the sea of forgetfulness Hallelujah think of a sea of forgetfulness God cannot remember them no more because they are both dead and buried it cannot be even remembered no more they are out of God's memory are you not so happy because of the blood of Jesus you know I look there and I look at my life you know you can look at your life too how can you make it to heaven with the kind of life you have you can't you can't but as you were going there was something a stri of blood anyone who crosses that it cleanses God's memory all that you did in your past and the Bible says walk in them no more we are saved through faith in his forgiveness a finished work we accept his forgiveness by repentance and faith and in the same same way we must forgive others Ephesians 4:32 kind to one another be tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for christans 32 listen put on the as the elect of God holy and beloved BS of meres kindness humbl of Mind meekness long suffering foring one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quar against any forgive one another even as Christ forgave you so also do you but when we have a quar against one another you find people talking talking talking talking talking there is nothing that kills a body Church like a gosip nothing kills the body of Christ like gospel I'll tell you this church the spirit of unforgiveness cooperates with the spirit of gossip and the spirit of discouragement did you hear what I said are you hearing what I'm saying over there are you he the spirit of unforgiveness cooperates with the spirit of gossip and the spirit of discouragement you find a brother who has not forgiven a brother he goes and begin gossiping about him can you imagine this brother stole my money he told me to borrow him I gave it to him thinking he's a believer he didn't bring it back and then this brother he was holding this brother in high regard the he hear this brothering about this what you mean brother never paid even the way he's talking his voice will be shaking he disappointed is there a believer in that church now the brother is discouraged he will come to church and he will sit the pastor will preach and brother will interet and then the other brother will what are you telling us others even about their pastors and this breaks the hearts of people will not even come back to church even if they come back they are wounded you will call them you are lost these days oh God bless you how are you I'm fine pastor this brother used to be S what is happening why are you not coming to church no I'm fine I'm fine I'm just busy with work but I come now the spe of deception has also come what started Spirit of Unforgiven with gossip coated with disappoint discouragement and now deception and the fellowship is broken the fellowship is broken G they will be there I've been in such Fellowship where you you you you can go in the church and you can literally feel those Spirits I'm talking about you can feel literally feel the spirit of discouragement the spirit of Gossip the spirit of Gossip by can never hide itself when you were gossiping about something and theor talks about something you will begin looking at each other even in the church you are goip that is a spirit it's a spirit you said how do you a spirit because I'm I'm a spiritual doctor and I'm telling you that is a and we must fight against it we must never allow it we must never permit it in the fellowship people who permited even in their marriages their marriages fail you hear this from this you hear this from I always talk to people but when it comes to my wife I I said please you have no right discuss my wife in your mouth and have done it with some people here they know because that's a nogo area she's my wife she's a part of me I am the one who loved chose her you can't tell me any gossip you have heard about her if you have heard some gossip about her go and pray for her and if you move it around you will have God to contain with you have some people who are busy bodies in other many's matters they know what happens in every family in every marriage in everything they they claim to know I know brother so and so you see I told you brother Andre I told you you see now his wife is sitting the other side I told each other you have a spirit of gossip on you and you need Deliverance these are the demons that bring you know uh discouragement in the fellow instead of people growing in the Lord people become spiritual dwarfs whereby they don't grow in the things of even when you hear something that is sincerely true about a brother or a sister it is your duty to protect them by all means by all means by protecting them you are protecting yourself killing somebody is not getting a sword and Pi our Prophet told us it is talking about a brother he said no matter what you do never speak evil against a brother if someone comes and asks you tell me how is he brother om some people ask those things not because they love brother om but because they had some rumors and they know that you were close to them e person will begin boiling down the information he has had he will keep it for one week and the second week it will be very heavy for him he'll go to another one my sister you know you you are like my sister yeah don't you of course you know you can trust now I'm going to tell you this don't tell anyone and some sisters especially women the moment words come it's going to walk like a virus that's the truth sister is that not true I'm not talking I'm you you are very good talking about women generally don't I'm saying don't you know women that's like a virus and the church will become sick sick wounded because they allow the of gossip but where does it all begin from one thing lack of forgiveness if Believers were more forgiving let me tell you we would not have goel forgiveness in the family a brother forgiving his wife the wife forgiving a husband you know learning to forgive one another learning to work together in tenderness forbearing one another any have a [Applause] against is it possible for a brother to have a qu against another brother yes but he says forgive if you have a forgive one another even as Christ forgive you so do you also in First Corinthians 1 I read from the Amplified it says it is not rude it is not self-seeking it is not provoked it's talking about Love Char it's not rude it's not self-seeking is not provoked nor overly sensitive and easily angered anded it does not now this is the point here it does not take into account a wrong endured you you know keeping records of what the person did for you know what they did to you last year in the month of January the month of March the month of Fe and December and you keep that fight Pi another fight and you record all those things some of you have those records of the wrongs that you you have endured from love is not that way love is kind in Matthew 18:21 the scripture says then came Peter unto him and said Lord how how of shall I shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him seven times Jesus said unto him I say not unto I I I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven so I say if you cannot forgive someone it shows you hold anger it shows you have bitterness it shows you have resentment and I'm mature all growing believer should not have place for those in their heart praise the name of the Lord you know this reminds me you know brother I saw brother brother OK online I don't know where they still online Ethiopia you know it even goes from person to person to to to it goes from that even to you know nation and cultur and tri you know when I I was in the north there I found almost all their livelihood is taken from them you know the government came and wiped out people and killed people almost like a so I just felt you know to speak this to those Brothers over there forgiveness that comes from the level of a Believer down here even to a nation imagine you see a government that has almost taken away everything from you what do you do do you Hur them for life if you do that you won't have your faith won't be activated you have to forgive you forgive them you let it go praise the name of the Lord in first John the Bible says if we say that we have we have not seen we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us but if we confess our sin he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteous he is quick some people say I'll forgive you but give me some time he is faithful and is just to forgive our sin if we confess them he forgives us the moment we confess the moment we ADM he forgives us immed what about you you tell your brother it's all right I'll forgive you but give me some time some time for what anger is brooding in you bitterness is brooding in you still resent that person some of you are even married but you're still quaring within you and the children see that did you know we are having a generation that is no longer interested to get married I've increased seen that why because of the parents the marriages they've seen they've seen they have no interest in those things someone has grown up seeing especially here in Africa seeing a father beating a mother and is the one who always goes there no don't fight don't fight now tell that boy or that guy to get married what are you talking about marries for the we but let me tell you brethen let not the world Define us it's not what the world thinks I can do what the world says I can do what the promises of the word are and the Bible actually God tells us that marriage is a blessing and we must keep it that way the married where are you say Amen must keep it that way you must show love to your wife is it important for me to show love to my wife yes it is important is it important for God to show us love yes if he forgive us he shows us love every day of our Liv there it's not only in the honeymoon it is past honeymoon past years and years that is the love we have between us and Christ Even in our marriages those of you who are married should continue permanently by the way I always tell people you don't fall in love you grow in love you thought you loved them much of that was much of it but when you begin as when you begin in Christ you Contin grow in that love you continually grow in that quite frankly I tell you the truth 11 years pass but if it's a feeling I feel that I love my wife more than I loved 11 when I was young I was young and foolish at some point I was looking at people who lose their wives I'm like oh they're getting an opportunity to change getting another wife and another one and I was like I don't know how many I will have in my life that was foolishness but now I look back at that and say I must have been foolish I did not know what it means 10 years into marriage if I lose her I will never marry again it is difficult you you become one with a person born together and marriage is a sum of all the Forgiveness that you give to one another every single day in that marriage almost every single day but you find people who are in marriage and every day they will face East and West every day because they are by something by something by something I made up a declaration I said when I was beginning if there is if there is a qu the Bible says use the word here a misunder understanding between me and my wife that we will not sleep over it at least we should sleep at 3 or 4 a.m. in the morning but we must handle that because what if Jesus comes that night you've not forgiven one another husband and wife you will go both to both of you you make it the Rapture you may not go to hell you will not make it the Rapture you will miss out because you are not clean and in your heart you have anger you have bitterness you have resentment I believe that forgiveness is a will something that you decide to do NE the other party deserves it or not now in Luke 17 verse1 it says I'm I'm pleading with you Saints don't just listen to these things and go practice this sumon today after you get out begin immediately begin correcting the mess forgiving one another said here if a brother has trespassed against you go and tell him don't just I'll keep it to myself keep and bitterness in your heart go to him do you remember you offended me I am Sor the problem forgive but here he said one thing I want to highlight here offenses will come they will always come but why unto him through whom they come there are some people who don't fear any danger they are always the ones to bring an offense always you the one you are always the one why do you want to offend Brothers offenses will come nonetheless when a brother repents forgive tell your neighbor forgive let them forgive hallelujah praise the name of the Lord amen I just want to find a place to finish here I want to give you two examples of the people having the spirit of forgiveness and the spirit of forgiveness is the spirit of Christ in Luke 23:33 says and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the male factors one of one on the right and the other on the left then said Jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his rment and cast lots this is a man that come to save the sinners from their he was F falsely accused you know they they took him to the Cross they beat him up they tore up his and at the end of it all what would you think he would say I wonder if one of us here was to replace Christ on the cross I wonder what she would say if you are the one being beaten when you fely accused about two three times I've survived being caught in China once in Ethiopia about twice you know taken being I was almost taken to jail for preaching Christ but I wondered each moment I go back in the room and say what if I was caught what would I do in China I remember that one clearly I was ready to die accepted I remember that's the closest I came to of course if they catch you preaching you gone that one I remember but Ethiopia several times I was ready to be caught in Tanzania I almost died but each of these times the people these people are filled with anger they don't know even what they doing because they preaching the gospel of life but they get anger because you are preaching against what they believe and and you know Jesus he was caught and he was beaten and he was taken to the Cross if it was you what would you do what would you do some of you with the bitterness and the anger you have you would have Cur like Peter did you remember Peter was when they wanted to catch him Peter cast Peter a brother an apostle he cast and rejected Christ with passion when this was but you were one of wrong with you get away from never seen but Jesus being who he was he showed us the way of a Believer after they did everything to him they spot on him they beat him they they rejected him they accused him falsely Hallelujah at the end of it all he said father forgive them they know not what they do that is the spirit of Christ and if the spirit of Christ is in you you will do the same same thing the people may do all things to you but that's you you have no words father forgive them others when they say father forgive them they're like they meaning God judge them have you not seen them when they offended do you know who I am I'm a Child of God may God forgive you but really they mean God Revenge you that's not the spirit of Christ let me show you what the spirit of Acts 7 verse 58 will end with this and cast him now they're talking about St Steven and how they cast him out of the city and stoned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was s this man Sten was preaching by the way and he preached and he he starred their hearts and he grieved them them and when those things happened then you know they stoned him they dashed his head in and kill him took his CLS and and and and put it On's feet who later became Apostle Paul but at this time he was still s I want to show you the effect of forgiveness and they sted Steven calling upon God Steven while they was stoning him was calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneeled down and he cried with a loud voice let not this sin to their church and when he had said this he fell asleep he died did you hear what St did he forgave them he forgave them same thing with the church history was Mar or some you know how they came to you know to to kill him but he told he told him wait give me some time let me first I think it was two hours or something he started praying praying for his captain pray for his enemy pray for the king for his enemies and and also his brothers but you if you had a chance and someone was killing you because of the Gospel you first pray for 30 minutes you just pray for your help me to go and then you pray for your children when I die let them not suffer and then remember your mother and your grandmother and also your wife and also you remember all those ones and now you can now you can take you don't remember your enemies how many of us when we pray we pray for our enemies if you don't pray for your enemies you are not a full Christian that brother you don't like that sister you don't like pray for them and when you are praying for them don't say God may you rebuke them you work on them Believers don't pray such prayers we pray for them what we want God to do for us that's why some of you are miserable because God is bringing the prayers that you pray for your enemies on you let the prayers you pray for your enemies be upon you in Jesus name that means if you're not saying amen you're not praying good prayers for them oh may you get a change today in this service from today begin praying good things for your enemies amen pray for them God to bless them God to reveal himself to them pray for God to forgive them their sins pray for God to prosper them if your enemies Prosper is not a problem to you it is a blessing to you because some of those enemies of yours are your enemies because you are prospering and they poor so if God prospers them then they will never be your enemies again can you see you are all winning we have to have an attitude of Christ have to have a heart of a Christian a heart of a Believer some people have bad hearts bad attitudes whenever they see someone prospering someone happy they feel bad they're like oh God that man they always wish I wish something bad would happen they can't say it but they think it it's a bad attitude it's a wrong Spirit you should have the spirit of Step Steven whereby he prayed for these who had killed him just before he died he said Lord do not lay this sin on their church one of those people was sa he end up being Apostle Paul because of forgiveness if Steven had not prayed a prayer of forgiveness you will not be saved today you see how powerful forgiveness one man forgive and the entire gender dispensation receive would come out of that and receive the grace of God and the calling of God he said I'm the Apostle to the Gentiles he preached all over the world and we receive the Gospel because of apostle Paul why because one brother who was offended by Paul forgave Paul forgave others who the the man actually it is said I don't know whether it is Cornelius or somebody else but there was a man one of them who actually pierced Jesus's side but Jesus prayed he said father for them among them the soldiers they got saved friends we should have an attitude of Jesus Christ we forgive one another we should forbear one another I know these kind of sermons don't excite many people because they feel like they're being rusted but if I'm going to be your pastor I'm going to tell you the Bible truth and this Bible truth will set us free God bless you you may stand on your feet [Applause] praise God I'd like us to sing that song

sister if you not overcome this it's going to hinder your prayers to God it's going to hinder your faith it will render it useless powerless but if you can receive forgiveness in your heart you will receive a breakthrough you will activate that faith in you things that were difficult and impossible will become possible eventually all you need to do is to make up your mind to have a decision to forgive now the other party may not deserve it for [Music] sure but that doesn't matter it's your choice it's the choice you make to forgive the other person and to release yourself from that anger from that [Music] bitterness I want to how many are here today like that I'd like to pray with you as we close you can just reach out your hand to him and say Lord I'm one of those I've been having

purposed for me I don't want anything to rob me of your blessings by keeping me in one place not overcoming I also have my eyes closed so I do not know who is like that but I'd like to pray with you you might be online God knows your heart let us pray father Lord creator of Heaven and Earth we have come to a close of this service but at this moment we want to surrender some people here of whom this service was made for and they said Lord take away this bitterness out of my heart this anger in my heart this malice and resentment take it away from me I let it go I let it go Set Me Free from this things I forgave my brother I forgave my sister because they the purches of your blood lord they're saying I realize it's not been me it's the devil trying to bring me hatred is the devil taking me away from my position in Christ but like you foret for me Lord they're saying I also forgive my brother I forgive my sister I pray that you forgive them Lord you let the peace that is beyond all's understanding you let it come upon them and cover them give them so so much joy so much joy since forgiveness has come into their heart so much freedom in the spirit that they will love one another that we will stick one one with another one with another forgive one another and that the devil will be defeated in our MST Lord Jesus May that Spirit of Revival not never die may we each day of Our Lives desire to have more of you we desire to come the flesh to overcome the pride of life to overcome whatever the enemy has to bring keep us focused on the mark of the prize of the high calling in Christ I ask your blessing Lord upon your people give them your grace and let what they have had today permanently impact their lives in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] amen amen God bless you God bless you all there's a sister from gab God bless you welcome for coming to fellowship with us today you're welcome to come again uh this one is saying I thank God for giving me a laptop I've been sharing a laptop but now God has provided me my own for God's service and for my job so you would like to to have it dedicated amen I believe that we should dedicate everything we have to the Lord not only children but our house when I I remember when we used to move into a new [Music] house thank you he says uh we would call the pastor to come and and dedicate it when we we travel and you know go into hotels the first thing we do is to dedicate it because we believe whatever is ours is the Lord is if you get a new car new motorcycle dedicate it to the Lord you get a wife dedicate her before the Lord before you start living with her we do that in marriage ceron you understand when you talk everything literally everything children we dedicate them before so if a brother wants to dedicate his laptop that's a good thing um also there is uh this brother he says God bless you Saints we request for your Mighty prayers as we are to se our D exams this is Brother Samuel Walker Walker and brother Solomon all right so we'll first dedicate this and then pray for them let us pray father in the name of Jesus we thank you because all good and perfect gifts come from you to our brother Lord this laptop to use at hisob to use for your work father Lord he desires that he will be in service for you not only him but also all that he has and he has brought this back to you for a blessing may you keep it good mechanical condition that it will be able to serve him well and in so doing he will also in return be able to serve you and may he serve you Faithfully taking him from level to another for your name's glory and Lord we remember our brother samel and our brother Solomon as they're going to sit for their exams we commit them into your hands Lord may you sustain them may you remind them all that they started and whatever that they will do they will excel and your name shall be glorified thank you because we believe you have done it in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] amen praise the Lord so God bless you all your dismiss we shall be staying the ministers the one I mentioned shall be staying back for meeting [Music] God bless you Church yeah this is from Brother Isaac ISAC yeah brother Isaac is the bride to be the groom to be yeah so he's requesting all the members of this church in fact all of us we all in brother is's the one heading the media team believe that he's doing a tremendous work so kindly uh if you are going to he want all of us to be there but you requested kind to register yeah you're going to confirm your presence there with God bless you now I would like to clarify something here I know I've heard statements like some of these young people are proud what what the young man told me what he was planning to do I told him I think it is okay in some of this developed countries they do [Music] things it is called [Music] RVP I don't know what the word in full but it means respond so we can know you are coming so we can prepare for to the extent if you you said you are coming only one and you come with two more people they will have no seats for because everything is prepared and booked and aranged so so I think it is a if we can adopt some of these things it will help us most of us are young people most of you can do this so um I think we can adopt it I'm coming with this number of people my contribution is this much paying it on this de the person can also know but now when we go CU I've been with most of these young people when we are planning for weddings and when we go to the venue we talking to the service providers the question is how many people and then you begin um 80 90 Maybe and then shortly before he said no no no and then some people promising 200 and then eventually they become 300 that's Africa for you but I think we can change that how many agree with me we can change that I believe we can change that last youth meetings we made a record we we I think about 300 that was a record it was the first time it has happened and the first time we said okay but a few almost n so 3 and 500 came but I remember I talked to them this time we will be very strict when someone doesn't register we will not serve them we will not give them priority because we want to prepare and arrange accommodation this so if someone doesn't how can you take so this youth meetings we are going to be very strict the good thing it is youth meetings they can learn so I think we should adopt this these things I was talking to Brother David mayor May on our last youth meetings he told me uh looks like you you are having more than you expected I said well what happened is when we registered regra not everyone registered so many show up on the last minute he was very shocked how then can you take care of them so in their countries which are far developed more than ours is a shock for you to just show up it is it is shocking how come you never informed us you know but for us even a relative can come from the village and visit you together with some of I don't know how many and they sit there you want them go away and you want ask them for how long are you for me I ask when they come I say what's your [Music] program I asked them what the program okay I get a picture but even then it sounds rude what I'm saying our generation but we make them hard they said they confirm 80 now you say they 80 people and then 200 people come on the day that is why when you're preparing you for 80 people and they come that is why we have learned excess the other ones you give them excess those other ones who come you add Somey yeah you okay we expect 100 but if there is EXT we shall pay even the people who are cooking instead of cooking for 100 they cook for 120 a on theost so if some of these weddings we can begin doing these things even if we have 20 people on the wedding no problem no problem the issue is the bride theom the parents the and a few friends and then the is finished don't complicate it I was we were we were going to see some wedding venue some younger people so they found there was a wedding already so they told him Pastor should we go and eat some what you mean you also fler I couldn't believe that even Believers fluk food I think that is a scene for sure anyways God bless you your old amen [Music] and [Music] take where you go precious name oh your Heaven precious name oh how [Music] sweet brother [Music] mesus brother Jo about to your Heaven precious name [Music] oh hope of Earth and [Music] Jo oh the precious name of Jesus how we
