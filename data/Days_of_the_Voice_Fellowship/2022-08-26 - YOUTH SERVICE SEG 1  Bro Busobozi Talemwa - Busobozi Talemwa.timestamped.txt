[46:16] let's go to the Bible
[46:18] is
[46:26] that's something around products
[46:38] [Music]
[46:40] it's just after Proverbs amen chapter
[46:44] one it's too late
[46:50] and we will read the whole chapter so
[46:53] for the standing we'll just read a one
[46:56] of one or three verses and then we'll
[46:57] see
[47:04] amen
[47:07] the words
[47:08] of the preacher Eric
[47:11] the son of David King of Jerusalem
[47:15] vanity of vanities
[47:41] saying the preacher
[47:44] vanity of vanities
[47:59] Lord we ask that you will just come on
[48:04] as a brother spoke
[48:08] in the beginning for a few moments
[48:11] we also just want to check another few
[48:14] moments to speak to uh these young
[48:17] people
[48:20] and everyone else that is here with us
[48:24] that are streaming now and that we will
[48:27] watch this service Western
[48:41] Uganda and many others
[48:42] those that will watch this service after
[48:45] many days
[48:58] foreign
[49:08] and this is just I was just trying to do
[49:13] a sample
[49:16] to see how it would be we did not make
[49:19] any prior announcements
[49:23] and really most of you uh youth in this
[49:27] church
[49:32] okay
[49:44] they can maybe can help us
[49:57] the statutory is that so different
[50:04] uh okay so you didn't count yourself
[50:08] foreign
[50:44] foreign
[51:01] [Music]
[51:21] uh I'm sure we will have more than 200.
[51:24] and those are twins
[51:27] because if I was can make 40.
[51:31] that means and because I'm considering
[51:35] because also who are not here
[51:40] I know brother Isaac is told me that he
[51:44] could not leave work and well of course
[51:47] we did not announce the meeting early
[51:48] enough so they could not allow him
[51:51] because they had a supervision at his
[51:52] place of work
[52:00] and I know there are others in that
[52:01] category
[52:04] so I was just trying to do a sample to
[52:06] see how it would be
[52:09] this is our first youth meeting
[52:17] amen amen and I know there will be many
[52:19] more that will follow
[52:23] I will be bringing in guest speakers to
[52:27] speak to you
[52:29] again
[52:33] I have in mind about two brothers in
[52:37] Nairobi who have a real good Ministry
