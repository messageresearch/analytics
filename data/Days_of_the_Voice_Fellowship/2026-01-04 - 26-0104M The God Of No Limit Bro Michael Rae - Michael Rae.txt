There's a time when we were there at the clinic and all of a sudden a brother came and gave us things that we did not expect. He brought for us a microscope. He brought medicine. brought a dental chair all free of charge. We thank God for that. And then at the beginning of this year, God has done us well again. Uh it was on first when my husband was at the pharmacy and met a colleague. They are not friends for long. But I think sometimes God makes you meet some people for a purpose. This person as they were interacting told him there is a deal of an ultrasound scan and the the owner of the ultrasound scan got a challenge and was selling it by faith. We just went and saw it. We didn't have any money because it needs some millions of money. We didn't even have 200 on us. But we went by faith and saw it. But by yesterday in the afternoon, God made a way and we have it in our custody. We bless the name of the Lord. Thank you so much, sister. We really thank God. Amen. Sister Phill knows all about us.

So our new visitors after the service and you'd like to join and support one of our groups, you are most welcome. God bless you. Amen. Brother Isaac is going to speak to us briefly. Let's sing one song as he comes across. Oh Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. &gt;&gt; I'll live for you alone. Every breath that I take, every moment I'm awake, &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me. Lord, I give you my heart. I give you my soul. I live for you. For you alone, every breath that I take, every moment, &gt;&gt; every moment I'm awake, &gt;&gt; have your way. &gt;&gt; Lord, have your way in me. Amen. God bless you. Uh we had prepared to show you the illustrations here. Yeah. But uh logistically we have been unable. But if you want uh we are going to uh show you this after we have a meeting after the service for the youth camp. So if you want to get these details kindly remain behind so that we shall show you all the details. So I'll be brief. We started getting the contributions for the youth camp. Mostly it was from the youth and we get we got overwhelming pledges. So by the grace of God we raised we raised a good amount of money. So let us clap for ourselves and also clap for Amen. &gt;&gt; So an overview is here. Uh we had here we collected a total uh like 64 pledges as in from 64 people pledged that is for the youth camp for different amounts. And of the six tip four people 53 have cleared something towards the wall. Yeah. Meaning only 11 have not given anything. This means those who have paid it's from as low as 2,000 to 1 million. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So the amount we raised was we pledged was 14 million and 716,000 and of that amount uh we have been able to raise um to collect a total of um a total of 8 million 583,000. We are having only four days remaining to the youth camp and currently uh we are having uh a budget come rain comes sunshine we won't get any other money from any like the church and everything all right so this means we are having a balance a B of 20. Of course, this some of this amount will be got from the people who be camping from the camp fees but it can't be all of these amounts. So this literally means us who pledged and have not completed our pledges, we need to uh finalize this before Wednesday and those that have not contributed kindly reach out to us after the service. We appreciate those who have given uh today morning we have received a good amount of pledges in cash. God bless you. So lastly, the amount I've been mentioning came from the youth. So let's really clap for ourselves. You have never done this before. So for the uh the higher uh I think I can talk of uh the 40th floor the fourth floor up up we have received only from four people. So and the total pledge is 456. and their own reform. So for the rest, reach out to us and let us petition the 24 million. If we get the 14, maybe that 10 might come from the camp. Yeah. So God bless you. And if you are really touched and you want to have this uh done in the best way taking good care of the ministers having we already secured our place so kindly get remain back so that we can plan then as as I also finish if you want the accommodation for the youth camp. &gt;&gt; We have negotiated and you can get a very very executive accommodation at around 120. But if you have 100, you can also see us. If you can't afford that, you can get someone. someone then you be two then you split it into two. &gt;&gt; Yes. So though I'll be glad to see the for each day. Yes. But it's like it's like a hotel. &gt;&gt; All right. God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother Isaac. &gt;&gt; Let's get on our feet. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Just turn around. Uh, look to your neighbor. Ask them, "Are you happy?

Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we I'm just giving him all my pastoral responsibilities now. So for this service is our pastor. Amen. So let us stand again. We already late so we don't want to waste any more time. Uh now for those of you who do not know, brother Michael Ray is a friend of mine, someone since we met, we've just you know come to love him as a man of God and uh you know he has always been I've always been meeting him on this side and I had an privilege to also meet him on the other side and I tell you what he and you know treated me like a king when I was young and so you know uh I I think did the best. what I felt and I was very well taken care of and um you know this is a person who has a passion for this message who has a desire you know to do whatever he can you know he's been preaching a youth camp at um Gaza this last weekend and immediately he came here we've been with him since I think Tuesday, Thursday and so we were here. He was trying to help with the training of the audio translation. I'm happy to see brother Edson here. Yes. Uh, brother Edson is going to be how many here speak. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, brother Edson Edson &gt;&gt; is going to be the voice of brother Bam in. And so, Brother Michael has been laboring here like from morning to evening all the way trying to train brother Edson. We also had other brothers. So, brother Michael is really burdened and with a passion to take this message out and I think that's something that I and him share. So, it has united us in heart and so uh for you who don't know him, he was our first youth camp speaker and at that time we were here. But you see, he also visited us when we were still in the little shop over there. We call it a little shop. And so I'm sure he he can see the growth and all that. We've been with him all the way. His grandfather mentored me in this message ministry. For those of you who don't know, he's a I'm sure he doesn't want me to say, but he's a grandson of Eddie Biscaris. I think I'm personally very honored to have him and you know for him to accept to come and preach for us this Sunday morning. Are you all happy that we have brother? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, brother Michael Ray from Canada. &gt;&gt; Canada. &gt;&gt; Just let us sing that uh one more time. as he does. Here I am to worship. And then as uh I think he will just invite the uh uh the babies the baby to be dedicated. to bow. &gt;&gt; Here I come to you. You're all together. All together. &gt;&gt; Amen. Is he wonderful to you this morning? &gt;&gt; God bless you. God bless you. So good to meet you. &gt;&gt; Yes. It was only two months ago and God gave us a great opportunity to be back here again. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I know you've had already a big morning and this fast, but we have a a little baby dedication. Brother Basaboszi would like to dedicate his little newest addition to his family. Amen. Amen. Amen. So why don't brother and his lovely family come today. Oh my. I love God loves life. God loves life. I just to me the birth of a little one, a little precious little soul that enters into this place we call time is to me a precious thing. So it'll be an honor this morning to you. Give back to God what God gave to you, his precious family. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here or here. Right. Wherever is all right. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Now look at this. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Family. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; My goodness. Well, you're going to have to hold a microphone for me. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Okay. But just in a second. Okay. &gt;&gt; This is a special little one. I don't know how much I should say or will say. &gt;&gt; Well, we had a a privilege. This precious little daughter that has been added to this family is named &gt;&gt; Esther Beth. Esther Beth Telster. &gt;&gt; You want the whole thing? Esther Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Esther Bethlehem. Amen. And what a what an honor. We were speaking with brother Abbas and little one who just arrived just on Tuesday, I think it was. That's correct. &gt;&gt; Monday, forgive me. Landing and flying. I got it a couple days ago. Mother bus desired what? just desire a name for this little one. And we were able just to speak with brother Bus and communicate. And you started I said, "Brother Bus, what's the name of the children in your family?" And he started to go through the names of his daughters and each one and his sons. And each one was named from a a sister of the scripture. that we reach in and draw strength from. &gt;&gt; And so there's some powerful names here within this. And so he went with the little little one that arrived, this little daughter, just as I just said to brother Bus, I said, "But Bus, your family is named with women of scripture, women of faith." And it would be right maybe to stay within that inspiration within the within your family. And so the name Esther Bethlehem was what brother Bus and his wife so desired to name her. Esther is quite a sister of scripture. &gt;&gt; In Persian it means a star and we know the term Esther but in Hebrew Esther means a hidden one. And I think about the the message that brother Brandham speaks, a hidden life in Christ. And I just pray that this little one radiates, the life of Christ that is hidden within the house of God's brain, hidden within Bethlehem. the place where God dwells. &gt;&gt; That's where I want to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may she may she draw from her name's sake because a name is an anointing. When you name a child, you're placing an anointing upon that child. And so it's not done, you know, very casually. And so you're praying it, you you find the inspiration that God has for this. May she be the brightest star in this life. In every family, sometimes we have our children. Different ones have different characteristics and But when she walks through your door, may the life of Christ radiate from you. Why do we pray? &gt;&gt; Wow. I hope some of you are jealous. Why don't we pray? &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, in my arms I hold life that you hold so precious to you. Lord, I think of the scriptures when you said suffer the little ones. Lord, you had a desire in your heart. You wanted to bless them. Lord, you wanted to lay your hands upon them, Lord, and give them blessings of strength. Lord, you you loved them. Lord, you even wanted our faith to be childlike. Heavenly Father, Lord, here brother Bus, his lovely wife, Lord, are giving this little bundle of treasure back to you, recognizing that you're the giver of life. So Lord, they dedicate this precious little one, Esther Bethlehem, to them. &gt;&gt; Lord, that you would take her in your arms, God. Lord, as I would be cradling her, may your arms cradle her, Lord. Year after year, may you guide her and lead her, Lord. May, Lord, you wrap such a protection around this little bundle. And you'd anoint her, oh God. anoint her as your name so speaks that she would radiate with the glory of God and her life would be a hidden light. Lord shut away shut in with God in a secret place. May it be behind the inner veil that she lives. Lord, the veil of the holiest of holies would drop behind her, the place of her passion, the place of her desire, the place of a refuge and be hidden within Christ, I dedicate her back to you. In the name of Jesus Christ, I pray. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right, let's turn to our Bibles. &gt;&gt; You've sang, you've worshiped. We've dedicated a little one back to him. But now the word takes preemptive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We got to give room for our savior in the word this morning. Are you ready to pull a little bit? &gt;&gt; I've preached a few times already. &gt;&gt; So, I'm kind of oiled up. I'm ready. But I sure hope you are. Are you ready this morning? &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. And let's turn to our scriptures in Numbers 13. Brother Bus supposedly said this morning, I said, "How long do you preach, brother Bus, on Sunday morning?" So he we just talking. He said, "Well," he said, "there's no limits." Little did he know I'm preaching on the God of no limits. Amen. An unlimited God. Amen. So, let's dig into the word. Numbers 13 1-1 17. Quite a lengthy scripture. So, I'm just going to paraphrase my way through if I could and I'll let you sit down. But here it is in scripture that Moses was going to send the spies into Canaan. And he said unto them in verse 17, "Get you up this way southward and go up into the mountain." And Moses wanted them to go see the land. whether the people there are strong, whether they're weak, whether they're few, whether they're many. He says, "I want you to know what the the land that they dwell in. Is it good? Is it bad? Are the cities there? No. Are they tents? Are they strongholds?" Moses wanted to know this. He was very keen, VERY, VERY INTERESTED. IS IT FAT? Is it is it lean? He said, "Is there wood?" In verse 20, man. So Moses was very interested in the resources of the land. He said, "And be of good courage. Bring of the fruit of the land." Cuz now was the time of the first ripe grapes. Amen. Moses was very very focused on a certain thing. Let's bow our head in a word of prayer. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we're so desirous this morning that you would speak to us. Many are at church this morning, Lord, outside hearing different services, Lord, around here. Lord, we're not just desiring to come in in a form of tradition. We're not just desiring to come in a form of worship. But we're desiring to come that the God that we serve, the God that we believe, the God that lives amongst us, would come in our midst and dwell in the house of worship this morning. And Lord, you'd meet our needs. Lord, you'd meet our burdens. You lift us up in courage and strength. That you would prove one more time that you're a living God. Prove your word one more time. We commit it to you now in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses was interested. God bless you, brother Henry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How you doing? &gt;&gt; I'm fine. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Let's take off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses was interested in this land. And so the spies they went up as you would read and you can just work with me through the scripture verse 21 and on. And so now they ascended into the south and they came into hein. They came to the brook of Eshko and they cut down a branch of cluster of grapes and they bare between two upon a brought it of the pomegranates and of the fig. and they returned of the from searching the land 40 days and they came to Aaron and Moses and of the congregation and of the children of Israel and brought back word unto them. Can you imagine the children of Israel were eagerly waiting a response? They were waiting 40 days over a month waiting. What? What are they seeing? Are they still okay? Are they alive? And here they START TO COME BACK. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT MOMENT as they were carrying the grapes and pomegranates and figs on a staff? We're talking grapes. GRAPES. CAN YOU THINK OF THE EXCITEMENT? THEY'RE RETURNING. THEY COME BACK OUT OF THE LAND. THEY'VE GOT SOME FRUIT. THEY'VE GOT PROOF THAT IT'S A GOOD PLACE. SO THEY CROWD AROUND, let them through. LET THEM THROUGH. Moses and Aaron. So they here come to this place and they say they show it to THEM AND THEY TELL THEM WE CAME FROM THE LAND WHICH THOU sent us AND SURELY SURELY THEY WERE TESTIFYING OF THE GOODNESS IN THE LAND. &gt;&gt; SURELY I'VE WALKED THROUGH IT. &gt;&gt; I'VE WENT THROUGH THE LAND AND IT'S GOOD. HALLELUJAH. They had a little TASTE and the scripture says it flowth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it. &gt;&gt; Who has your Bibles open? Who has your Bibles open? Verse 28 of chapter 13 in Numbers. Can you read for me the first word? Can Yeah. All right. Everybody did it. Thank you. &gt;&gt; They all helped you out. &gt;&gt; Never the less. &gt;&gt; Nevertheless. That's what it says. IMMEDIATELY THEY put a limit. Surely the LAND IS GOOD AND GROWETH MILK AND HONEY, BUT nevertheless the people ARE STRONG. NEVERTHELESS, THE cities are wall. NEVERTHELESS, THE WALLS ARE GREAT. AND MOREOVER, THERE'S GIANTS. &gt;&gt; SO WHERE THEY WERE EAGER, THEY'RE RETURNING, THEY'RE RETURNING. Suddenly the water just went on the fire. The Amalachites dwell in the land. The Hittites dwell in the land. The Jebites dwell in the land. It's not empty. &gt;&gt; IT'S FULL OF BELLS. It's full of the Amorites. It's full OF THE CANAANITES. IT'S FULL OF HOLLYWOOD. IT'S FULL OF MUSIC. IT'S FULL OF ALL THE PERVERSION. IT'S FULL OF SO MANY BATTLES. NEVERTHELESS, NEVERTHELESS, IMPOSSIBLE. But verse 30 says, &gt;&gt; actually I'm not going to read you verse 30. &gt;&gt; I'm going to wait &gt;&gt; because humanity is transfixed with the world and desiring to find resources. Moses was LOOKING FOR RESOURCES. HE WAS ASKING THEM, "IS there wood? Are they what's in the city? Is it a fat land? Is it a lean land?" And the world's no different. The world has fought battles for resources. Spain traveled to America for gold. England, France, Rome. They've conquered for every COMMODITY UNDER THE SUN. EVERYBODY WANTS A RESOURCE. AMEN. AMEN. Many have come into into into Africa because Africa is full of resources. You have an abundance of resources AND PEOPLE WANT IT. MAN WANTS RESOURCES. And so they wage war to conquer, to try and take, to gain. And so they'll move they'll spend thousands and millions of dollars because without resources a kingdom will fall. Without resources your economy suffers without resources there's no growth. You need food. You need wood. You need money. You need minerals. You need you need grain. You need rice. &gt;&gt; America &gt;&gt; fought the revolution. They fought for freedom. They say, "AH, WE FOUGHT FOR FREEDOM." &gt;&gt; YEAH. But England actually wasn't looking at that way. England was fighting that war for the resources. And man has realized that there's a limit in resources. So who's heard the term renewable resource? No. Nobody. &gt;&gt; Renewable energy. renewable energy. Yeah. Like water or wind, you know, they have a wind turbine that can spin with the wind and generate power because wind is renewable. So man is looking for something that's renewable, continuous, always there. The water will always flow. It generates electricity through a dam because man realizes that we're of limited supply of certain resources. Our body has limited resource. Anybody that's getting a little older can realize that I don't quite have the same resources inside. That I used to have. So man is always hunting FOR MORE. HOW CAN I extend my years just a little bit? you know, how can I tap? Is there a little more potential inside of me, right? Or so keen on that. AND that's why they make so many books and movies. They they want super abilities, TAP tap into some resource or potential, right? some superhero THAT WAKES UP SUDDENLY AND HE'S A SUPERMAN SOMEWHERE INSIDE SOME ABILITY SPRUNG UP. Man desires it so bad. &gt;&gt; Let me define for you limited. You know what limited is? It's small, restricted in size. It's it's meager. &gt;&gt; It's scanty. It's deficient. It's insufficient. It's patchy. BASIC FINITE in short supply. Does that define it good enough for you? It's hard for our human mind to comprehend unlimited. IT'S HARD FOR US BECAUSE WE'RE CREATURES OF TIME. SO THERE'S A LIMIT OF TIME. WE'RE creatures that live by money. And so we we understand there's limits there. There's a limits of our strength. There's a limits of our body. AND SO BECAUSE OF OUR HUMAN MENTALITY, WE we tend to try and measure everything. We have scales because we need to see how much this weighs. Is this small amount? Is this a big amount? And we have a graduating scale from super teeny, super small to great and large, right? So we understand the limits. You know, you care about limits actually or should you care about a measurement because you would care if someone says, "Well, here's $10 or here's$10 billion." Would you care? You'd be pretty happy. There's a unit of measurement there. &gt;&gt; It doesn't really matter. I'll take $10 or 10 billion. It doesn't matter. It matters to you. It matters. Amen. And so we care. So God, you know, but if I COULD SAY GOD THOUGH IS NOT A MAN THAT IS RESTRICTED TO HUMAN LIMITATION. HE DOESN'T HAVE A UNIT OF MEASUREMENT. BUT we tend TO LOOK AT GOD THROUGH OUR EYES OF HUMANITY AND WE RESTRICT HIM TO OUR OWN BARRIER, OUR OWN LIMIT OR OUR OWN ABILITY. Is that true? It's because we HAVE A HARD TIME understanding unlimited or no limits. Because no limits or the UNLIMITED GOD MEANS HE'S THE INEXHAUSTIBLE GOD. HE'S THE LIMITLESS GOD. HE'S THE UNFAILING GOD. HE'S THE MEASURLESS GOD. HE'S THE UNRESTRICTED GOD. HE'S THE UNCONSTRAINED GOD. HE'S THE UNRESTRAINED GOD. HE'S UNCONDITIONAL. HE'S ABSOLUTE. HE'S SUPREME. HE'S SOVEREIGN. HE'S OMNIPOTENT. HE'S UNMEASURABLE. THAT'S MY UNLIMITED GOD. DON'T BOX HIM IN. DON'T PUT HIM IN OUR ABILITIES. BUT REALIZE YOU SERVE A DIFFERENT GOD. HE'S NO GOD OF STONE THIS MORNING. HE'S HE'S NOT A GOD OF STONE. HE'S NOT A GOD OF WOOD THAT IS LIMITED TO NOTHING. BUT MY GOD IS ABLE. HE'S BOTTOMLESS. HE'S INCALCULABLE. HE'S EVERLASTING. HE'S IMMENSE. HE'S VAST. &gt;&gt; HE'S GREAT. &gt;&gt; HE'S SUPREME. MY GOD IS UNBRIDLED. I gave you a word for every one of you. You can take just take ONE OF THOSE WORDS, WALK OUT THIS DOOR AFTER THIS SERVICE AND SAY, "I SERVE A SOVEREIGN OMNIPOTENT GOD." AMEN. There's no unit of measurement FOR GOD. GOD doesn't be like, "Well, that toothache is a piece of cake. IT'S SUCH A SMALL problem to me. But that cancer, man, that's a real struggle. I MEAN, I GOT TO work really hard. I got to really FIGURE OUT HOW TO TACKLE THAT CANCER. THERE'S NO UNIT OF MEASUREMENT TO GOD. WHETHER IT'S A TOOTHACHE OR A HEADACHE OR A CANCER OR A DEAD BODY OR A LOST AND WEWARD SON OR DAUGHTER. GOD DON'T CARE. IT'S ALL THE SAME TO HIM. HE'S UNLIMITED. DON'T MEASURE HIM. DON'T TELL YOU, WELL, THIS IS SO SMALL. THIS IS SO BIG. HE'S ALL GOD. ALL YOUR PROBLEMS BECAUSE scripture says and Jesus LOOKING UNTO THEM SAID WITH MEN WITH MEN IT'S IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE MEN ARE LIMITED MEN ARE BOUND MEN HAVE A A LIMIT BUT WITH GOD ALL THINGS NOT SOMETHING NOT A FEW THINGS NOT ALMOST EVERYTHING ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; There isn't a problem in this room. &gt;&gt; THERE ISN'T A SITUATION IN THIS ROOM THAT GOD CANNOT take care of. DON'T YOU SIT THERE AND GO, "THIS IS A PRETTY TOUGH ONE FOR GOD." IT'S NOT TOUGH FOR GOD. GOD GOD DON'T KNOW TOUGH. GOD DOESN'T KNOW DIFFICULT. GOD DOESN'T KNOW COMPLICATED. WITH GOD, ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, "WHEN THE BRETHREN RECEIVED THE BAPTISM of the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; HE SAID THIS IS THE SUMMIT. &gt;&gt; THIS IS THE PEAK." BUT BRETHREN, THAT'S WRONG. HE SAID THERE'S NO SUMMIT TO GOD'S POWER. YOU COULD REACH THE MOUNT EVEREST OF GOD'S POWER AND AND MAN WOULD THINK THEY'RE ON TOP, BUT WITH GOD, JUST KEEP GOING. YOU COULD STAND ON THE MOON OF GOD'S POWER AND YOU'D THINK YOU'RE ON TOP, BUT JUST KEEP GOING. YOU CAN STAND ON THE SUN AND THINK YOU'VE REACHED THE PEAK OF GOD'S POWER, BUT KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING INTO ETERNITY AND ETERNITY AND ETERNITY. THAT'S GOD'S POWER. HE SAID WE MOVE ON AND ON. IT'S THE UNLIMITED RESOURCES OF GOD. THAT HAS never I want you to think about this. This is a quote. This is from the PROPHET OF GOD. HE SAID, "The unlimited resources of God has never been tapped. Do you know how many problems that have transpired on the earth over 6,000 plus years? Can we just Can we even figure out a number? How many problems do you have? How many PRAYERS HAVE YOU PRAYED? I CAN TELL you you have more than one. You have more than one problem. True. You have A BUNDLE OF PRAYERS. YOU HAVE A BUNDLE OF NEEDS. AND THERE'S 8 BILLION PLUS PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET. THAT MEANS THERE'S BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF NEEDS RIGHT NOW. RIGHT NOW AND OVER 6,000 YEARS, HOW MANY BILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE LIVED ON THIS EARTH THAT HAVE HAVE HAD BUNDLES OF PROBLEMS AND THEY'VE PRAYED TO A GOD AND HE'S NEVER BEEN UNTAPPED. HE'S NEVER BEEN TAPPED OUT. YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING TO THE END OF IT. YOU THINK YOU'RE COMING TO THE EXPIRATION? &gt;&gt; God's thermometer. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. It's 2026. I'm almost at my limit. IS GOD WONDERING, "OH MAN, CAN I MAKE IT THROUGH 2026? DO I have enough IN ME TO MEET THE NEEDS OF MY PEOPLE? GOD ISN'T DOING THAT. GOD'S NOT LOOKING AT NO MEASUREMENT. WHAT YOU NEED IN 2022 IN TOMORROW, &gt;&gt; NEXT MONTH, NEXT YEAR, GOD WILL STILL BE ABLE TO MEET IT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The problem was The problem was at Kadesh Barnea there when Israel went over into the land and here the 12 men came came back and they put this this limit on God immediately and if I could continue to down to the end of chapter verse 30 chapter 13 &gt;&gt; I'm so glad glad there was a different PERSON THERE. I'M so glad it didn't end it at nevertheless because you hear A LOT OF DOUBT. YOU HEAR A LOT OF ISSUES. YOU HEAR A LOT OF COMPLAINTS. YOU HEAR A LOT OF PEOPLE SAYING, "OH, THE MESSAGE IS THIS. THE MESSAGE IS THAT WE CAN'T DO THIS AND WE CAN'T DO THAT." BUT CALEB, CALEB STILL THE PEOPLE, "STOP." &gt;&gt; He said, "Let us GO UP AND POSSESS IT, FOR WE'RE MORE THAN ABLE TO OVERCOME IT." &gt;&gt; He's all alone. &gt;&gt; Is anybody with me? &gt;&gt; Him and Joshua. Joshua and him. Caleb. And they say, "Well, no, no, no, no. But the men that went up, CALEB, BE QUIET. WE are not able TO GO UP AGAINST YOU. FOR THEY, the giants, ARE STRONGER, THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, than we. Wait a second. We are not able to go against the people, for they are stronger than we. They had missed the POINT in this MOMENT AFTER THEY'D GONE THROUGH PLAGUE AFTER PLAGUE. MIRACLE AFTER MIRACLE, RED SEA OPENING, ALL THE QUAIL AND THE MANA AND SUDDENLY AT THIS HOUR THEY'D MISSED. IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM. WHAT HAD THEY DONE ALL THROUGH THE PAST? DID THEY PART THE RED SEA? &gt;&gt; DID THEY BRING QUAIL OUT OF THE AIR? DID THEY SMITE THE FIRSTBORN? BUT SUDDENLY, OH, THE GIANTS ARE STRONGER THAN WE. THEY HAD COMPLETELY DISREGARDED THE FACT THE FACT THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS IN THEIR MIDST. THE PILLAR OF THE CLOUD WAS IN THEIR MIDST AND THEY DISREGARDED IT. THEY TURNED THEIR BACK ON IT AND SAID, "OH, IT'S STRONGER THAN US." They had a pillar of fire by night and a CLOUD BY DAY. AND THEY BRING AN E THEY BRING AN EVIL REPORT AND THEY SAY WE CAN'T DO THIS. THERE'S GIANTS THERE. IN FACT, LET US GO BACK TO EGYPT. LET'S get us another captain. Can you imagine the pillar of fire? The pillar of fire hanging here RIGHT NOW AND THE WHOLE group says, "Forget it. It didn't do anything for us. &gt;&gt; He didn't deliver us. WE'RE GOING BACK TO FLORIDA. FORGET MOSES. We need a new captain. &gt;&gt; They completely disregarded, the resource, the unlimited resource that was sitting in their midst. And that was their critical FATAL error that they made there. God never forgot it. But I'm glad the story doesn't end THERE BECAUSE JOSHUA COULD SAY, "AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, CALEB COULD SAY, "AS FOR ME IN MY HOUSE, I DON'T CARE WHO TURNS BACK. I DON'T CARE WHO FALLS AWAY. IF THEY FALL AWAY AND THEY FALL AWAY, BUT ME, I RECOGNIZE THE PILLAR OF FIRE IN THIS HOUR. I RECOGNIZE THERE'S A CLOUD THAT CAME IN THIS HOUR TO VINDICATE THAT THE SAME UNLIMITED GOD IS HERE IN THIS HOUR LEADING YOU, leading you, LEADING ME, I WILL NOT DISREGARD THAT HE'S UNLIMITED. AND IF HE CAN LEAD CALEB OUT OF A LAND, &gt;&gt; HE CAN LEAD YOU AND I &gt;&gt; INTO GLORY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That's why Romans 8, that's why Paul quoted for you and me. For who HE DID FORNO, HE DID PREDESTINATE TO be conformed to the IMAGE OF HIS SON THAT HE MIGHT be the firstborn among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did predestinate them he also called. WHOM HE CALLED, HE ALSO JUSTIFIED WHOM HE JUSTIFIED, HE ALSO GLORIFIED. WHAT SHALL WE SAY THEN TO THESE SAINTS? If God BEFORE US, WHO? &gt;&gt; ANIC, &gt;&gt; THE GIANTS, &gt;&gt; HOLLYWOOD, &gt;&gt; YOUR ISSUE, &gt;&gt; your issue, &gt;&gt; YOUR ISSUE, &gt;&gt; YOUR PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE THAT BEFORE GOD? &gt;&gt; CAN THAT STAND BEFORE YOU, BEFORE THE PREDESTINATED, BEFORE THE JUSTIFIED, BEFORE THE TO BE GLORIFIED? WHAT CAN WE SAY THEN? GOD BEFORE YOU. WHO CAN BE AGAINST YOU? &gt;&gt; I want you TO WALK THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO WALK THIS MORNING. &gt;&gt; I WANT YOU TO BE LIKE CALEB THIS MORNING THAT WHEN HE WALKED INTO THAT LAND, HE WAS LOOKING AT THE RESOURCES. &gt;&gt; He was LOOKING AT A GOD &gt;&gt; WITH NO limits all around him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Israel &gt;&gt; looked across &gt;&gt; and they looked at the joy &gt;&gt; that was set before them and said, "It's not possible. There's no way for me to have my joy. There's no way for me to have my peace. I can't do it. &gt;&gt; It's greater than me. &gt;&gt; I don't have the strength. Meanwhile, Caleb, he said, "Oh, God. It's not my strength. It's not my ability. I'm I'm getting older, but you promised it &gt;&gt; and you're the unlimited God. You made the promise. I know you can deliver it. My frailties mean nothing. My weaknesses mean nothing. I need to get WEAKER SO YOU CAN BECOME STRONGER THROUGH MY WEAKNESS. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a terrible thing. It is a terrible thing. When you see somebody and they're achieving below their ability. You ever SEEN SOMEBODY AND and they're underachieving, you know, there's more that they can do, but but they're down here and you're just like, you need to press forward. You know, maybe there's a TALENT THERE. AND THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT REACHING to really press into that gift God has for them. It seems like it's just it's within reach, but they don't know it and they don't achieve it. That's terrible. someone living underneath their god-given privileges. &gt;&gt; In second Kings, 2 Kings 7, there's a group of men and they sat there in kind of one of those moments and there had been a terrible FAMINE IN THE LAND. THEY WERE UNDER SIEGE. SATAN HAD BEEN ALL AROUND THEM. ENCOMPASSED THEIR CITY. IT WAS A DARK TIME. MAYBE IT WAS A LESS SEA OF DARKNESS. AND THERE WAS A GROUP OF MEN THAT SAT THERE AND they were lepers and they HAD NOWHERE TO GO. ALL THE RESOURCES WERE GONE. NOTHING TO EAT NO MORE. EVERYTHING WAS OUT OF REACH. Or so they thought. As far AS THEY KNEW, WE'RE GOING TO DIE HERE. WE WAIT. WHAT? WHY? IF WE SIT HERE, WE DIE. IF WE GO TO THE SYRIAN, WE DIE. WHY DON'T WE JUST GO TO THEM AND ASK? WHAT WHAT DO WE HAVE to lose? You know, THERE'S AN ABUNDANCE OVER THERE AND MAYBE THEY'LL GIVE IT TO US. BUT THEY WERE UNAWARE THAT A PROPHECY HAD ALREADY BEEN GIVEN OUT. GOD HAD ALREADY PROVIDED AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT YET. CAN YOU IMAGINE THIS MORNING IF YOU COULD BE SITTING LIKE A LEPER? REALIZING GOD HAS ALREADY DECREED THROUGH OUR MESSAGE OF THIS HOUR, HE'S ALREADY PROVIDED, BUT DON'T BE SITTING LIKE A LEPER SAYING, "WELL, I'M JUST CONTENT TO SIT HERE." GET UP AND HAVE WHAT THEY SAID. THEY SAID, "WHY SIT HERE TILL WE DIE? WHAT I'M DOING RIGHT NOW ISN'T DOING ANY GOOD. I WONDER WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING. MAYBE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING, GOD'S ASKING YOU TO GET OUT, GOD'S CALLING YOU. STEP FORWARD. GET OUT OF THE PLACE WHERE YOU'VE BEEN. GET OUT OF THE STAGNATED MEMORY THAT YOU'RE IN. BREAKTHROUGH." &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AH, WELL, &gt;&gt; they're going to kill us. &gt;&gt; You know what? If we, you know, they've been HERE FOR YEARS, AND &gt;&gt; I'VE BEEN TRYING FOR YEARS, Brother Michael. I've tried to serve God, BUT SEEMS LIKE NOTHING'S REALLY HAPPENED in my life. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, BROTHER MICHAEL. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY FULLY SURRENDER. YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW, BROTHER MICHAEL. IF I DO THAT, MAYBE MY FRIENDS WILL LEAVE ME. MAYBE MY FAMILY WILL FORSAKE ME. MAY MAYBE THEY'LL MOCK ME. WHAT EXCUSE? I ASK YOU, WHAT EXCUSE &gt;&gt; IS WORTH NOT GETTING THE RESOURCES GOD HAS FOR YOU? Those four lepers could give a lot of excuses. Oh, they might kill us. They might they might KILL US RIGHT AT THE DOOR. YOU KNOW, THEY MIGHT THEY MIGHT DO, YOU KNOW, BUT THEY'RE SAYING, "BUT WHAT'S THERE TO LOSE? &gt;&gt; WHAT'S THERE TO LOSE?" &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW. IS IT WORKING FOR YOU? CUZ THEN GET UP. WHY SIT HERE? WHY SIT IN THE MUCK? WHY SIT LOST AND WRETCHED? WHY SIT THERE AS A MEDIOCRE LIFE AS A MESSAGE GIRL OR AS A MESSAGE BOY? JUST JUST PLOTTING AS A MESSAGE. GOOD BELIEVER. GOD HAS MORE FOR YOU, GET UP. WHY SIT HERE TILL YOU DIE LIKE A RICH YOUNG RULER? THAT'S NOT YOUR CALLING. YOUR CALLING IS TO GET UP AND ATTAIN. Why sit here bound WITH SOME MALICE? WHY SIT HERE BOUND BY SOME HURT? WHY SIT HERE BOUND TO SOME PAST CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAS WOUNDED YOU? That your spirit is hurt? WHAT EXCUSE? IF YOU COULD stand before God and God is saying, "I'VE GOT RESOURCES. I'VE GOT HEALING FOR YOU. HEALING FOR BODY, HEALING FOR SOUL, HEALING FOR SPIRIT." AND YOU STAND BEFORE HIM AND SAY, "WELL, so and so said this to me, and I couldn't go any more further." &gt;&gt; That's a good enough excuse. GET UP AND RETAIN. GET UP AND TAKE WHAT'S YOURS. GET UP AND GET INTO THE PROMISED LAND. GET UP AND RECEIVE WHAT GOD GIVE YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; They were willing to do that, &gt;&gt; not even knowing it was prophesied. WHAT ABOUT YOU AND I who know it's there? Why would we sit here in this in this ecstatic place of our life? Let's press forward. Brother says, "Choose you this day who you'll serve." THE HOUR HAS COME FOR A DECISION to be made. He says, "What more CAN GOD DO?" HE SENT down signs and wonders, DISCERNMENTS, PROVED IT SCIENTIFICALLY. PUT IT ON A PICTURE, SEND IT ACROSS THE WORLD. THOUSANDS TIMES THOUSANDS ARE WITNESSING. But he said, "What about you?" He says, "They arose in the middle OF THE NIGHT AND WALKING BY FAITH TOWARDS THE HOST OF SYRIANS." AND GOD honored their faith. And you know what happened? They started to reap. I mean, they must have been RUNNING AROUND THE TENT. LOOK AT THIS JACKET. LOOK AT THIS GARMENT. LOOK AT THIS GOLD. LOOK AT THIS GOODNESS. THEY STARTED TO HIDE IT. Hide it. Someone else IS GOING TO COME. WELL, wait a second. THEY SAID, "WAIT A SECOND. THIS ISN'T RIGHT. You mean God gave US ALL THIS FOOD? YOU MEAN GOD GAVE US THIS WHOLE MESSAGE AND THIS WORD OPEN UP IN THIS LAST DAY? I MEAN, GOD POURED IT OUT FOR US. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HOLD IT IN. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T HOLD IT IN, BROTHER. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO GET IT OUT. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO SPREAD THE JOY. &gt;&gt; WE GOT TO SPREAD THE FOOD. WE GOT TO SPREAD THE GARMENT OF THIS WORD AROUND THE WORLD. FOUR LEPERS GOT THE VISION OF GETTING A MESSAGE OUT. MAY I BE LIKE ONE OF THEM LEOPARDS THAT GOD HAS MADE WHOLE AND IN THIS HOUR CATCH THE VISION THAT I NEED TO GET THIS WORD OUT BOOK BY BOOK MESSAGE BY MESSAGE TRACK BY TRACK LIFE BY LIFE. Let let the book live in me. Dear Lord, &gt;&gt; SHOW ME MYSELF &gt;&gt; WITHIN THY WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; There's no more siege on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, &gt;&gt; Trinity tried for a long time. &gt;&gt; No more. There's no more siege on merit, my ability, and my actions. Grace stepped in. &gt;&gt; THERE'S NO SIEGE. SYRIANS HAVE NOT SELECT around the SIN IN THE GARDEN. THEY DIDN'T KNOW APPLE IN THE GARDEN. &gt;&gt; WE KNOW WHAT IT IS. WHY? BECAUSE GOD BROUGHT RESOURCES. INTO THIS HOUR. &gt;&gt; And that's what I'm tapping into. But Abraham says in the church and you sitting here tonight, he says you're struggling and struggling and God's pulling you to showing you things. you can get past that sin barrier of unbelief, then unlimited revival will break out through THE UNITED STATES AND EVERYWHERE. He said until you break through and the Holy Ghost comes upon you, he says you're beyond it. Then time to break through a little bit. Caleb broke through and Joshua broke through. Men of and women of the scriptures HAVE BROKE THROUGH. THIS HATE HAS BROKE THROUGH. WHY? BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN GIVEN A MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; IT'S OUR TIME. &gt;&gt; AN OVERCOMING LIFE. LIBERTY IS YOURS. JOY IS YOURS. &gt;&gt; I know you got a camp coming up. &gt;&gt; I know you got some meetings coming up. &gt;&gt; I say, why sit here till you die? Get up right now. Don't start then. Don't start then. Don't start at the next meeting. God saying, "Hey, lift up right now." REVIVAL CAN START RIGHT NOW. HOLY SPIRIT CAN DROP RIGHT NOW AND YOU CAN THEN CONTINUE. CONTINUE CUZ HE'S UNLIMITED. DON'T LIMIT HIM TO NEXT MEETING. DON'T LIMIT HIM TO NEXT CAMP. HE'S HERE THIS MORNING. THIS VERY MORNING. THE STARTS NOW. JUST GET UP. GO. CLAIM THE WORD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Man wants to tap into potential. They try to find where they can mine what's been hidden. A potential is a latent quality that can be developed and lead to future success. So that latent quality, it's something that's sitting dormant. It's hidden until circumstances are suitable for development. It's just kind of like that little seed that sits there &gt;&gt; and it lays dormant in the soil. And God wanted to show there's more inside these vessels. There's potential in these vessels. And man is is TRYING TO FIND IT. MAN'S TRYING TO FIND THE limitless aspect of humanity. IT WANTS IMMORTALITY SO BAD. AND GOD THROUGH the scripture, he he he'd have a little seed there and it would show in the Old Testament, a little shadow. And in Samson, &gt;&gt; Samson would break through WITH THE STRENGTH. START TEARING WITH A JAW. This is beyond the limits of a human. Something's different there. Or they'd come before Solomon. They come before Solomon. They bring their problem. Hey, Solomon, this is my situation. those two little mothers fighting over a baby. Solomon says, "Give me a sword. Give me a sword. We'll divide it." &gt;&gt; No. Here's the true mother. Everybody in the throne room will receive. Where'd this WISDOM COME FROM? THIS IS beyond man. Something's different here. &gt;&gt; Daniel showed the dreams of Nebuchadnezzar. Oh, the wise men were going to get killed. And he comes and says, "Your dream has been revealed to me. This is what it is." Who is this? How can a MAN DO THIS? AND GOD WAS SHOWING just little by little in the Old Testament. There's a resource. &gt;&gt; But something changed when a seed was placed in the womb of a virgin. And a little lady caught THE WORD OF HER. AND IT PROCEEDED TO PRODUCE something a little different. And out came what man looked AT was just a man. He got tired. He cried. He wept. He got hungry. He had sorrow. He laughed. He had joy &gt;&gt; just like you. And nobody took no mind when he stepped into a little wedding ceremony one day. &gt;&gt; Oh, Jesus is here. That's nice. It's good to see him again. Wonder how he's been. Last last last I saw him, he was having a real tough time. One of his one of his friends had passed away and he was really down and low. &gt;&gt; It's good to see he's out now socializing a little bit like a kind of his real self again. A real man again. And no one took notice. I stepped to the side, prayed over some pots of water, stepped away. Something was different now. WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND. SOMETHING THAT HAD BEEN CONCEALED FOR A LITTLE WHILE WAS NOW COMING TO MANIFESTATION. WHAT WAS HAPPENING WAS A HIDDEN QUALITY THAT GOD SHOWED IN TYPE WAS NOW COMING TO FULL MANIFESTATION. IT WAS ETERNITY combining with mortality. AND WHEN THAT TRANSPIRED, ALL THE LIMITS WERE REMOVED. NOTHING WAS HOLDING HIM BACK NO MORE. &gt;&gt; THE SPOKEN WORD RESIDING IN FLESH. &gt;&gt; IT WASN'T JUST IN PART. IT WASN'T JUST STRENGTH IN SAMSON WISDOM IN SOLOMON, BUT NOW THE WHOLE THING. ALL THAT GOD WAS, HE POURED INTO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; This is limited. This is limited. MY SIGHT IS LIMITED. I CAN'T see much further than PAST THEM TREES. MY SMELL, it's limited. I CAN'T SMELL BUT RIGHT HERE. BUT WHEN THAT WHEN THE ETERNAL ONE STEPPED INTO FLESH WHEN GOD LIFE DROPPED INTO FLESH ALL THE LIMITS took over all the natural limits. Oh, that's what the woman at the well experienced. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm thirsty. Can you get me a drink? Well, you know, you take your own. you know, get your drink. You know, you know, she was a thirsty woman. God knew what she needed. He said, "If I give you water, if I took a drink from me, you'll never thirst again." Wait a second. What man can say? Who can give you a drink AND NEVER THIRST AGAIN? WE'RE HUMANS. AND WE WILL BE ON THREE DAYS WITHOUT WATER. WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE. But if YOU GIVE ME WATER, YOU MEAN I'LL NEVER THIRST AGAIN? THAT'S BECAUSE I'M FROM ANOTHER KINGDOM. I CAME FROM ETERNITY. I CAME FROM THE ETERNAL REALMS OF GLORY. AND IF YOU RECEIVE OF ME THIS MORNING, RIVERS OF LIVING WATER WILL POUR OUT OF YOU CUZ IT'S NOT JUST MY LIFE AND ME. GOD WAS NOT CONTAINING IT JUST FOR HIM. DRINK. DRINK OF THIS RESOURCE AND YOU WILL RECEIVE OF THE UNTAPPED GOODNESS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine &gt;&gt; one by one person after person started to realize there's more to this man? then meets the eye. This is not just a HUMAN BEING. HOW can this happen? And that's with a little woman who had a blood issue. She realized there's more there. There's resources there that I NEED TO TAP INTO. I'VE GONE TO DOCTORS. I've gone to everyone that COULD TRY AND HELP. I've asked them. I'VE PAID THEM. I'VE GIVEN THEM EVERYTHING I GOT. AFTER 9 OR 12 YEARS, YEAR AFTER YEAR, THEY'RE TAPPED OUT. THEY'VE GOT LIMITS. &gt;&gt; AND I'VE EXPERIENCED their limit. But this one, from what I'VE BEEN HEARING, HE SEEMS like he DON'T HAVE A LIMIT. I HEARD HE SPOKE TO A WOMAN AT THE WELL. I HEARD HE SPOKE TO A ZAKIUS. I HEARD HE SPOKE TO THE LEPERS. &gt;&gt; I HEARD HE SPOKE TO THE BLIND MAN. I HEARD THAT HE'S A GOD THAT IS UNLIMITED. OH GOD, THAT I MAY GET THERE. WHAT DO I GOT TO DO? I GOT TO DO SOMETHING. I GOT TO GET TO HIS GARMENT. WHAT CAN I DO? BREAKTHROUGH. WHAT CAN I DO? GET UP. YES, YOU DIE. SO SHE RAN THROUGH. THROUGH. I NEED TO TOUCH HIS GARMENT. OH, &gt;&gt; SHE DID WHATEVER IT TOOK JUST FOR A TOUCH OF THE UNLIMITED ONE. &gt;&gt; I say to YOU THIS MORNING, the unlimited one is here. I don't preach this. I don't preach this to say that you can't reach him. &gt;&gt; I don't preach this this morning so that you can't reach him. I preach this this morning to let you know he's here. REACH OUT AND TOUCH HIM. You say, "Better Michael." It just seemed so easy for her cuz she could feel it. She could see it. Blessed are your eyes that don't see them, but yet believe that your faith reaches and touches him. Sometime that even feels difficult for me. &gt;&gt; Cuz my need is so great. Do you know how many times Butter Brown says you didn't know you had that much faith? He's just discerning the need, the Holy Spirit. They're sitting there right on a chair in the audience. He said, "You're healed. You didn't know you had that." DON'T YOU STRIVE AND STRUGGLE. JUST BELIEVE. LET HIM DROP IN THE FAITH. IT'S A REVELATION. IT COMES FROM HEAVEN ABOVE. &gt;&gt; I'm watching my clock. I think I've been one hour. You just let me come down to &gt;&gt; I know it's been a big day for you. But there was a duel one day. I love this moment in time. I think God must have been waiting for this moment. Jesus knew was coming and he walked he came across the water to the land of the Genan. And there was a man that they named Legion and by all man's thoughts this man was bound by demon upon demon. If I could say Legion was named such trying to convey, HE WAS SO FILLED WITH SO MUCH DARKNESS AND TORMENT almost if you could say he was filled with a seemingly unlimited amount of demonic power. Seemingly seemingly in God &gt;&gt; seemingly &gt;&gt; seemingly. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; It looks LIKE it was this pinnacle, &gt;&gt; the peak of Satan's unlimited power. Seemingly Satan, &gt;&gt; he said, "Let's watch this." &gt;&gt; OH, Satan was proud. &gt;&gt; This is my champion. &gt;&gt; No one. HE TEARS CHAINS, WREAKS HAVOC, PUTS FEAR, BROKEN HOMES, let's watch this one play, and a duel. A duel was about to happen. SATAN'S CHAMPION and the UNLIMITED WAR. COME ON. &gt;&gt; I WOULD WANT TO SAY IT THIS WAY. &gt;&gt; THE limited edition. Limited edition EDITION versus the unlimited edition. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE SHOCK? The shock &gt;&gt; when all God DID was just talk to him very quietly, you're loosed, loose him into the swine. Because scripture says by the finger of God GOD DIDN'T HAVE TO COME ON. &gt;&gt; He didn't HAVE TO DO THAT. BY THE FINGER OF GOD BECAUSE SATAN'S GREATEST IS DEFEATED BY THE FINGER OF ALMIGHTY GOD TO PROVE to you, HALLELUJAH. TO PROVE TO YOU. GOD DOESN'T HAVE TO GO IN THERE SWINGING, &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; AND THEREFORE, loose him and the chains broke free. In earth, &gt;&gt; it became to get very loud and joyous &gt;&gt; as Legion was rejoicing. &gt;&gt; Legion was rejoicing. &gt;&gt; In hell, it was very quiet. &gt;&gt; Reach out in faith this morning. and put hell &gt;&gt; into silence. Shock Satan by your faith this morning. What was God doing through all these moments of scripture? HE WAS SHOWING that when the ETERNAL GOD steps into flesh, the limits of MORTALITY are removed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; All right. But it did not stay there. &gt;&gt; Why? Because that's why the temple veil was rented. &gt;&gt; The barrier of entry. Man desiring LIMITLESS AND they're looking at IN A CARNAL REALM. AND GOD TEARS THE VEIL, TEARS THE VEIL AND ISSUES OUT HIS LIFE. AND THE BARRIER OF ENTRY INTO AN UNLIMITED LIFE OF CHRIST WAS REMOVED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; It was where the high priest could only walk in. Oh, if I could only go in there, experience the shikina presence. but only the high priest. I'm not even of the Levitical priesthood. I'll never get a chance to experience the beauty of his presence. And God said, "No, I'm going to change because I desire fellowship with you. Do I desire fellowship with you? I'm going to tear the veil SO THAT YOU TOO &gt;&gt; CAN COME in to my presence. IT'S OVER. &gt;&gt; NO LONGER IS IT JUST A HIGH PRIEST, BUT YOU HAVE BEEN MADE KINGS AND PRIESTS UNDER GOD. COME INTO MY PRESENCE. PARTAKE OF THE MANA &gt;&gt; THAT YOU MAY BECOME UNLIMITED. &gt;&gt; Oh my goodness. I having to pass some really good things here. I'm going to give you homework because you have a you have time maybe. But in your scripture, there's a man named Manasseh. No, somebody needs this. There's a man named Manasseh. He was the worst king. If you want to read the scripture about him, I want you to go home. I want you to read about him in Kings. You just search up Manasseh. And then he's also in Chronicles. 2 Kings 21. &gt;&gt; I want you to write that down. You go home and read about it. He was the WORST OF THE WORST. HE HE SACRIFICED CHILDREN. HE RAISED up altars in THE TEMPLE OF GOD. HE WORSHIPED BAAL. HE INFLUENCED Israel to sin. He was the worst of the worst. He sent innocent blood, shed innocent BLOOD till he filled Jerusalem from ONE END TO ANOTHER. IF I LOOKED AT THAT man say you are a evil wicked prophets came forth said I'm going to bring evil God was going to bring evil upon Jerusalem and who so heareth of it both his ears shall tingle GOD WAS SO UPSET WITH what Manasseh did. He said, "I'M BRINGING JUDGMENT THAT WHEN YOU HEAR OF MY JUDGMENT, YOUR EARS WILL TINGLE." God was choked. And you'd say, "There's no way that that man could ever be forgiven. &gt;&gt; But if you didn't read past 2 Kings, &gt;&gt; you might think that. BUT IN 2 CHRONICLES 33, it says, "Wherefore the Lord brought upon them captains of hosts, and he brought them and cap captured them to Babylon. And when Manasseh WAS IN AFFLICTION, BESOUGHT THE LORD HIS GOD and he humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. And then Manasseh knew the Lord, HE WAS GOD. AND HE WENT BACK AND BUILT A WALL AROUND THE CITY OF DAVID AND STRENGTHENED THE WALLS, FORTIFIED THE CITY. IF OUR GOD IS ABLE TO SAVE A MANASSEH, DO YOU THINK HE'S ABLE TO SAVE YOU OR YOUR LOST LOVED ONE? Because my God is limitless. &gt;&gt; And he sees a potential in you. God didn't go through all this time and going go to Calvary just to stop there. He says there's potential. But Abraham says, he says that same word living in you will produce the same thing that it did when it was made flesh. You mean the same thing? Ask anything in my name believing. &gt;&gt; Yes. The same thing because your flesh halted. Why was God so focused in this hour? focus on a union, an invisible union of the bride because God is wanting to bring life that's IN HIM PASS his seat into a virgin womb. It has to be the right one, the right man and the right woman. There's there's potentials inside a man and a woman. Bring the wrong ones together. You bring chaos, but bring the right ones together. God's ordained ones together brings beauty. And that's why GOD IS DESIRING HIM AND HIS BRIDE. NOT HIM AND A HYBRID BRIDE, NOT HIM AND A CONTAMINATED BRIDE, but him and a pure bride. That his word, he brother Brandham said, "God has never changed just the same today as he was then. He's determined to do something. He'll do it. And nothing is GOING TO STOP YOU. HE'S PUT A gene in you, SAINTS. YOU MIGHT NOT SEE IT. YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL IT. YOU MIGHT NOT EVEN HEAR IT. BUT THERE'S A RESOURCE WITHIN YOU. THE acorn doesn't know it. The acorn, do you think the acorn knows what lies inside of them? A peanut, a seed, a nut. Yeah. What's a seed here? What's a seed? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yes. You don't think that seed is like, "Hey, &gt;&gt; do you know what lies in me? I have the largest tree you can ever imagine right now." And the seed beside him says, "Yeah, that's real funny. Do you see the size you are? &gt;&gt; Let me just peel in there and look. &gt;&gt; Yeah, there's a tree in there. All right, &gt;&gt; go have another one. &gt;&gt; No, there is in me. I'm a mighty tree. &gt;&gt; You're insane. &gt;&gt; You lost it. You're a holy roller. You're a fanatic. And then along comes the great sewer. You know, they were having this conversation. He starts to throw the seed and his hand goes in and picks up the seed and he throws it. And that seed who was confessing who he WAS lands in some good ground and then down through the ages starts to come to a last age and the word starts to come starts to be ushered pour the rain starts to pour. The atmosphere starts to pour. God starts to cool through. And what that seed had confessed, starts to burst. AMEN. THAT'S WHAT WAS HAPPENING DOWN THROUGH THE AGES. THAT SEED THAT GOD PLACED IN HIS CHURCH HAS BEEN COMING FORTH. AND AT THIS HOUR AT THIS TIME THE MIGHTY OAK TREE OF GOD'S BRIDE IS MANIFESTING IN THIS HOUR PROVING YOU KNOW WHERE THAT other naysayer seed IS SOMEWHERE CHOKED OFF on the bad ground it's in the in THE DUST BUT the ones THAT LANDED IN GOOD GROUND NOT IN THE thorns &gt;&gt; not in the briars but in good found have grown and stretched forth its branches. These God is God is manifesting through resources through you. Sometimes it takes a deep minor &gt;&gt; to find to find to find the resources. You said, "Well, brother Michael, how am I ever going to be? You're telling me I'm such some great unlimited power force of God? That's exactly what I'm telling you. &gt;&gt; Well, that's just your words, brother Michael. Okay. You believe the prophet? &gt;&gt; Okay. And the prophet said, "And then get him. Get him in connection with his maker. Get him, GET HER in connection with your maker. He becomes a superman. Forget Hollywood. FORGET MARVEL STUDIOS. YOU YOU &gt;&gt; ARE THE SUPERMAN, &gt;&gt; THE SUPERWOMAN. AND THE WORLD IS MISSING IT. &gt;&gt; JUST AS THEY MISSED as he STOOD ON THE CROSS, THE SUPER KING OF GLORY. AND THEY SAID, "LOOK at that blasphemer." &gt;&gt; And they passed by you. And you're the super church. &gt;&gt; He said it. &gt;&gt; The star that was in the hand of God said it, &gt;&gt; not me. You say, "How am I a superman, brother Michael?" Because you walk out these doors. You walk down that street AND EVERY FILTHY DEMON TRIES TO THROW its wickedness UPON YOU and you bow your head AND YOU DENY IT BECAUSE YOU SISTERS REJECT THE POWER OF THE enemy that is wanting to have you adorn YOURSELF WITH FILTHY ATTIRE, FILTHY ADORNMENTS. THAT'S AN ABOMINATION TO GOD. BUT YOU STAND THERE PURE, SPOTLESS. YOU'RE A SUPERMAN because men, YOU AREN'T COWERING TO THE IDEALS OF WEAK MEN. YOU'RE A SUPERMAN BECAUSE THIS AGE OF WEAK LIVING AND NO BACKBONE ISN'T upon you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You sisters, you're superwoman &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU STAND UNDER LEADERSHIP. You submit TO HEADSHIP IN THE WORD. YOU ARE HELP MEETATS TO YOUR HUSBAND. YOU'RE SUPER MEN, YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG MEN. YOU'RE SUPER BECAUSE YOU WON'T LET PERVERSION OF HOLLYWOOD AND MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT. THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SUPER. YOU DON'T LET THE ADORANCE OF THE WORLD, THE PERVERSION OF THE WORLD. IT'S THIS HOUR BREAK FREE. OF THE LIMITS. &gt;&gt; YOU, you and me have been FUSED &gt;&gt; with eternity &gt;&gt; with eternity. &gt;&gt; So then I wonder this morning, musicians, you can come. Man is desiring for a power. And there's a power called fusion. &gt;&gt; It's the collision of energy. And you'd heard of you'd hear of fision which is the atomic bombision and it's the breaking apart of an atom. It's division. It's splitting and it creates great damage. you know, the atomic bomb, but there's a greater energy that that man is longing for. And it's called fusion where it it at the joining of POWER at at the collision, it creates a near LIMITLESS ENERGY. AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT this in 1949. Man, man was focused on the atomic bomb, the splitting to create power. But the same process that fuels the sun, &gt;&gt; the power that generates the energy OF THE SUN, IS FUSION, &gt;&gt; THE COMING TOGETHER, A COLLISION OF FORCES. AND I THOUGHT IN THIS HOUR AT THE END OF THE MESSAGE, A WORD WAS COMING FORTH TO BRING GOD AND COLLIDE HIM WITH A BRIDE TO FUSE GROOM AND BRIDE TOGETHER TO CREATE UNLIMITED POWER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OH, man longs for it SO BAD. BUT God's fused himself. It's uniting time. It's joining time. It's time to shake gravity. A POWER THAT HOLDS, A POWER THAT LIMITS YOU TO THIS EARTH. BUT A GREATER POWER IS PLANTED INSIDE YOU. AND AT THAT TIME AT THE SHOUT AND VOICE AND TRUMP OF GOD THE POWER THAT LIES WITHIN YOU IS GOING TO BE LOOSE AND YOU WILL HAVE UNLIMITED AND YOU WILL SOAR AT THE BLINKING OF AN EYE INTO RAPTURE. HALLELUJAH. That's what I call super. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So then I wonder this morning. &gt;&gt; Why don't we stand this morning change our position? I wonder this morning. &gt;&gt; You know, I just know the song I speak the name of Jesus. Just play that quietly, please. Speak. I wonder I wonder this morning. We can we can be so enthused. God's word stirs within us. But I wonder if you're willing to break past a barrier. I wonder if you're willing this morning. Why sit here till I die? Why not now? Reach into the heavenly office and set a wait for next service instead of wait for next convention. Why wait here and sit here when God is saying you can have what you desire. And next service, next service I have more for you. Don't settle for next service. God's not limited to just NEXT SERVICE. HE CAN POUR out now this MORNING AND THEN NEXT SERVICE MORE AND THEN THE NEXT SERVICE MORE. DON'T LIMIT HIM. And so brother Brandham says, he says, "Now I know at the end of the service looking to the unseen," he says, "the next row behind the woman's a man sitting there with trouble with his neck." He says, "If you believe, sir, God will make you well if you believe it." He says, "Do you believe it? Raise up your hand. I'm a stranger to you. But he's not. I may be a stranger to you. You may not KNOW ME TOO WELL, BUT HE KNOWS YOU. HE KNOWS YOUR NEED. He says, "WHEREVER YOU ARE, JUST HAVE FAITH IN GOD. CAN YOU PASS BY THAT BARRIER OF UNBELIEF NOW? CAN YOU CAN YOU LET THE HOLY GHOST COME RIGHT NOW AND TAKE OVER?" HE SAID IF YOU CAN, IF YOU CAN, IT CAN HAPPEN. HE SAYS THAT DIABETES WILL LEAVE YOU. GO AND REJOICE. GO AND REJOICE. HE SAYS IF you believe for that, the anemic that anemic CONDITION WILL LEAVE YOU. YOU BELIEVE THAT GO AND REJOICE. LET'S BELIEVE IT WITH ALL OUR HEART. If you believe, GO EAT YOUR SUPPER. THE ALTAR THAT YOU HAD IS LEFT YOU. IF YOU BELIEVE, YOU WON'T HAVE TO DIE. THAT CANCER HAS LEFT YOU. YOU BELIEVE, GO AND REJOICE. HOW COMPLICATED WAS THAT? THAT WASN'T COMPLICATED. THE SAME FAITH THAT THEY NEEDED IS RIGHT HERE. YOU TOO CAN BELIEVE. He says, "Now with one accord, pass every barrier. believe that God is here and the sickness and diseases SHALL LEAVE. HE says everyone you pray in your own way. YOU PRAY, IT'S YOUR NEED. IT'S HIS GARMENT YOU NEED TO TOUCH. I CAN'T TOUCH IT FOR YOU. I CAN'T SCREAM IT FOR YOU. YOUR FAITH. YOU PRAY, YOU BELIEVE. Heavenly Father, as we bow our heads this morning, your prophet said, "Oh Lord God, creator of heavens and earth, I now bring this to you. This audience OF PEOPLE, I CONDEMN THE DEVIL. I CLAIM JESUS CHRIST. GOD'S SON IS present in the name of the LORD JESUS. LET EVERY unclean spirit of doubt, superstition, unbelief, SIN, DEPART FROM THIS BUILDING, HE SAYS, "COME OUT, SATAN. I ADJOUR THEE IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST." That's a prophet's prayer over you. He said, "EACH ONE OF YOU, LAY YOUR HANDS ON ONE ANOTHER. PRAY FOR EACH OTHER EVERYWHERE IN THE BUILDING. GOD SHALL MAKE YOU WELL. HALLELUJAH. If you believe the unlimited God is here, You know our needs this morning, Lord. &gt;&gt; We're a needy people. We have burdens, oh God. We have heartaches, Lord. We have hurts. We have sorrows because we're human. We have limits in our humanity. But there's a God in our midst this morning, that can meet the sorrow, that can meet the pain, that can meet the suffering, that can return the joy, that can deliver the loss, that can break the chains of the bound. OH GOD, SHOW YOUR UNLIMITED POWER THIS MORNING. your word to this little precious group, &gt;&gt; Uganda. May their faith rise. &gt;&gt; May their faith rise. Oh God, &gt;&gt; MAY YOU POUR, OH GOD, YOU TEAR THROUGH THE ETERNITY THIS MORNING. MAY LIKE A THUNDERING CLAP, OH GOD, LIKE LIGHTNING, COME THROUGH THIS LITTLE ROOM AND START STRIKING THE SOULS.

Where God is trying to take us. How many can see? How many can see? Brother Mike has not been here. He didn't know we've been talking about this numbers. He didn't know we're talking about taking the promised land even on the crossover. This is what we're talking about and we're talking about walking with God. Joshua and Khal believe that they will receive their possession. This is a season for you to be placed in your possession. God is doing something among us. Amen. Amen. God is raising our faith. This is a season to tell US WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE. Let us not remain AT KADESH. LET US GO ALL THE WAY. BUT WHEN WE GET THERE, LET'S TAKE OUR PLAY POSSESSIONS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; God is doing something among us.

Hallelujah. There is a big oak tree here in each of you. In each of us. Amen. God is TRYING TO SHOW IT TO US. TELLING US, "OPEN YOUR EYES. ARISE AND SHINE. THIS IS OUR SEASON. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. THIS IS OUR TIME. GOD IS DOING SOMETHING in our little congregation." And I pray that each of you will move when the spirit moves. And that little widow had to keep powering by faith. Amen. But you know what? What made the miracle is her faith in the man of God is sending us all these men. Do we believe what God is saying? I said, do we believe WHAT GOD IS SAYING? AMEN. THEN IT SHALL HAPPEN. HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'm just excited in my heart. really not because I'm excited, &gt;&gt; but I I can see God. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We must possess the land. With God, all things are possible. God is not a man to be limited to human limitations. We have a big vision even as a local fellowship here. But I tell you what, friends, we are limited. But God is not limited with human limitations. And we just have to keep moving, keep walking with God because with God there is no limitations. He swore by himself. This is what it says and I love the title of the sermon. He swore by himself and you are here to fulfill it too. Just walk unconscious of fear. Walk unconscious of criticism. Walk unconscious unto the world. Amen. Walk as as you walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not paying any attention to the right or to the LEFT HAND. Just keep moving on. 26. We are going to keep MOVING ON BECAUSE GOD HAS SPOKEN TO US. THIS DAY, WRITE IT SOMEWHERE. THIS DAY, GOD HAS SAID THERE IS NO LIMIT WITH GOD. THERE IS NO LIMIT WITH GOD. I'M TELLING YOU WHAT, I received a new revelation right now. Amen. Not because it is new, but because it's new to me. IT HAS ALREADY BEEN THERE. AMEN. UNTAPPED. But God, Sister Shalom, has just told me today, there is NO LIMIT. DON'T ASK FOR TOO LITTLE. DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF. DON'T LIMIT YOURSELF. THERE IS NO LIMIT with God. Don't pay attention to any criticism or anything. Be unconscious of it. Hallelujah. Walk with God. Doctor says you're going to die. Walk with God. Walk with God. Just walk with God. THAT'S ALL. THAT'S ALL. FOR GOD has promised you. I will never leave you nor forsake you. I'll be WITH YOU TO THE END OF THE WORLD. And he took an oath by that covenant that he give you that he would confirm it. Just walk with God. And then he says, and brother Michael alluded to this, you will have your ups and downs. Don't worry. Tell your neighbor. Don't worry. Because this JOURNEY IS SHORT. AMEN. THE MOVING WE ARE MOVING IS by the revelation of the word and WE ARE THE BRIDE THAT CANNOT FALL FOR. WHY? BECAUSE WE HAVE a limitless call. Don't worry. Come on. Tap your neighbor. Tell them don't worry. Don't worry. AMEN. AMEN. YOU GOT TO GO THROUGH BRI PATCHES AND OVER SHARP ROCKS AND OVER BLUFFS AND DOWN THE HILLSIDES UP through the mountains over waters but walk with God. Amen. And now now this quote makes sense because we read it on the crossover. Now it makes sense. Why? Because our God is limitless. Now, I don't know about you, but I'm taking this personally. What has been preached today? It has been mine. How many can say it's been mine? Amen. Amen. God has no limits. Don't be afraid to believe God for big things. Praise God. Thank you, brother Michael. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. I tell you what, our youth camp has begun. It has just started today. You know I had in you did not know but I had invited brother Michael this year to come and uh be one of the main speakers for our youth camp but he they had also shadowed brother Tom to be here and at that time I was also going to Canada and so there's a lot of changes that were made to accommodate you know a lot of uh programs So he unfortunately told me that he cannot make it to Uganda being that he's going to be here in was it I think August or something like that October. So they could it could not be in October and again in January. It was too short time. I mean these trips are long haul trips. It's really long. I mean when I arrived there I told I told brother Michael man you live too far away. I told him I'm going to begin to take your trips whenever you come more seriously. But uh I've always taken it seriously but you know just more seriously and because you know the the the time that goes in and uh the travel and it's it's just awful and and and so uh it was not going to be possible for them for him to be here. Somehow, you know, we um wanted to work on the audio translations and project and and you know, he has a burden for that and and the brothers here needed the audio the translated sermons of brother Bham in audio and you know all these languages and so we wanted he he wanted to kickstart that and so that was big enough to bring him back and so he now told me you know I'm going to have to come back and and you know but I've pastor Steven has already asked me to preach for for him a youth camp and so that's how he was able to you know come and take the youth camp as well as work on this audio translation but I say nonetheless he has been one of our youth camp speakers because uh I feel like you know just a few days away from u but I feel like we are already in the g for that how many are not the same the way you came. Amen. I'm energized. Amen. I'm charged up. I'm charged up and you know to do for more for the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we give all the glory to the Lord. Amen. We have a few uh of our friends when I went in the back I noticed you know sometimes when you're here you can't not see very clearly the people in the back. I don't know if the received visitors today but I see a few new faces in our midst. Uh so um maybe I'll ask you to stand up if you've been here the first time so that we can have you greet the church. Brother, can you take the microphone? Someone, brother Brian, take the microphone to them so they can greet us. I know this young man. He was here the other day. Just your name and where you are coming from. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. I'm so happy to be here today. Uh my name is Java Francis and I fellowship from Budo Christian Fellowship Christian Fellowship. But I used to fellowship when I was still studying but since I completed a level I'm likely to be part of this fellowship. Hallelujah. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Francis. Brother Sister Jen told me about you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, Jack. My name is My name is Emmanuel. Ah, &gt;&gt; okay. God bless you. Okay, Mother Edson. Okay. God bless you. Sir, &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Um, okay. This is my first time to come here. I last time I went when we are still in the other shop, the pastor talk about it. &gt;&gt; I'm Andrew. Andrew. I'm from Little Flock Church. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. &gt;&gt; Today I felt the leadership to come here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. This is my hero wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; Just like my husband has said, we are not really visitors here. It's just that we've taken a while, but we are very happy to be here today. We just felt led to come here. and just meet the rest of the brethren. God bless you so much. Amen. God bless you. Thank you so much, Brother Andrew. I've now remembered you. Nice to be with you today. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Praise the living God. I'm patient. &gt;&gt; I came together with brother Andrew. Andrew, God bless you. Amen. And and also I I saw sister Sarah back. She's not a booster here. I saw some members of the family. And Mrs. Ephraime, can you at least stand up and welcome to us? We're happy to God bless you. God bless you so much. God bless you. Amen. I I was just making sure I know you have already been told but we are we have a deficit of 24 million shillings on our youth camp. So um I know that all the uh pledges were given by the youth and so the the ones who are not youth please also step in and support us the parents and all others uh whatever offering you give it's really going to go to support a young person. I tell you friends, I've seen a lot of lives transformed in these youth camps. I was even telling brother Michael this year I felt like counseling because we have a burden for our land land fund still pushing that and you know I felt like we're doing too much at the same time and yet we are still a young little church. So, but uh as I was preparing to cancel it, I received several testimonies from several young people that were impacted in the previous youth group. And immediately I changed my mind, I said, "We're going to do it." But after the service today, I've been encouraged. This is going to continue, friends. Because you see, our God is limitless. Because if I look at all the fun fans we've been powering in these youth camps, we don't have them. How it has been coming, how we've been doing it, it has been God and it will be God. But you see, you have to be a partner with God. Give and it shall be given to you. Amen. Because you see this is how God operates. This how God works. See, so uh we need 24 million shillings. I don't want to beg the people in the youth camp and tell them we have a deficit. We are the hosts. Let's do it. Let's do it. We have a brother Michael from Path and I know I don't know maybe we're still streaming. I want him to hear this. He sent you greetings. You know you are namesex. you know, actually it's going to be flying in when you're flying out. We just miss each other by a few hours. Brother Michael is a is a wonderful brother there and um you know is coming from P and then brother Joshua from Brisbane &gt;&gt; and brother Tasha from Johannesburg all these like brother Michael here are wonderful men of God and uh I was still even telling brother Michael why don't you it's just a few days why don't you stay how many agree with So anyways, we will see. But uh uh well, it is a hard one, but uh yeah, you you just pray and we are trusting to have a wonderful time. I've been measuring on the baptism of the Holy Ghost in these three camps. But on this uh fourth camp, I'm intending to really um the burden that I have is to ground the young people more in the present truth for them to know what is the message all about. What is this message? So that they too can have a burden and a vision to take them. So you be in prayer. Some people who are really really burdened to prayer I know they there just be in prayer. Uh some have just given up praying even please don't give up prayer. Prayer is very important. Be in prayer for these meetings. Even if it's a bunch of sisters or somewhere you know just be in prayer. God will bless and honor you as well. So we have we're going to have a meeting after lunch. Um, we just give it about um um I I I know we are not used to that but u I'm going to give you 2 hours 4 p.m. &gt;&gt; So if you leave far you don't need to go far. Let's be back here 4 p.m. so that we can plan. We've not had a lot of meetings this year and so we need a lot of uh finetuning and things uh the different departments and what exactly you're going to do and so if you really want to be involved not just an attendance but involved and of course if you know you're part of a department please come back at 4 p.m. I know we've not don't usually do it that way.
