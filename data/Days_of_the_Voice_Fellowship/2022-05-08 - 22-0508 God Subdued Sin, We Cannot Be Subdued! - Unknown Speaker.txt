our they let you know how far we have gone with our church land construction contribution fund yeah yes can you say it how many millions do you want to make the twice all kind of ceremonial you get diabetes also this shows me that i think some of you are not really invested in this really we need to do much more because the bible says write down the vision although it will tarry yet but it will surely at least he will not ask us why where are you in that shop we will tell him we are trying to do something to get out of the forum or watch why every week monthly obviously daily probably whatever is able for uh for you to do do something and relax amen mean and i i assure you every cobble every coin we collect is accounted for you're not to do it i take my liberty every sunday or every now and then to give you the updates i'll even read you names of those who have contributed sunday i think we the other sunday before sunday sunday you did i think about is it was it fifteen twelve million in new zealand remember that's not only in the month of may that is like the whole time that we we are targeting to have simon i'm happy to let you know that today as of today we have 18 million points praise the lord the new names or the new contributions i have here one is from brother andrew andrew and some of course which was collected in you of course come to me and you'll get all those figures because the time will come up and also if you've not if you've given and you've not had your name what day you know please don't go away just come and let us know that and together so that we can be sure that those funds are received and cindy as those are funny so how men if you are beginning to see and then you you begin to feel yeah if you intervene that means that is a hope against you but i want us to be hopeful in the lord i want us to last time i told you that god we are going to buy our church land 150 million karolin navagan that's the only difference yeah already whether he will touch someone who owns the land to give us for less taco oh you will do a miracle that you know for you and you give match i don't know why your ninja is that you can really also get the burden on google surely this is a need to give something to us and i'm so happy to see the the the brothers that we baptized the other times okay now that is out of the way uh now i want to give you the updates on the trip to karamo i'll need the screen i took some time and made a little presentation and that i need to show you i'm going to show it to you now in the comments uh so that if you did not go back with your agency you can have a feel of what happened amen i mean uh okay uh brother marvin i'm still waiting on you is our screen ready okay can everybody see that but [Music] the government trying to disarm the people government these people are warriors they have guns by the name and they have had it for years so the only way they can be able to kill them is if they use the airplanes and dizzy big guns but if they use i think that will be oh for just a moment for you to see clearly and that if they used guns one on one has done something wonderful anywhere else in uganda we preach you know people received it in karamoja in such a very very big way people who were the warriors of this message and they have actually they are the ones it is because of the believers of this message now developing we were in one place which i will show you shortly one way forward to everything in the benchmark and you know the chairman is the pastor is a believer the chairman is a believer the chairman they don't usually have issues because it happens once in a blue moon that was the chairman chairman i tell you this message changes sad people not only on the it's not like the brother was saying it's not a religion like these others it is christ and so on day number one so that is pastor charles there with the his associate brother edison oh yum sumba charles namud day number two we started meetings in morocco and this is a short clip of the service in morocco those people can really jump [Music] but then the day number three we were in my time now moroto moroto is the was the first massive church there you can say over here he was not educated but he was one of the first people to receive this message in this country by the way in the early my mom [Music] [Applause] [Applause] i think we have issues with that but i think you will see that on uh no but i need the picture where's the picture it's not moving did you notice that okay it is still not moving okay so then we went to you know in matan we had about um about 300 people mama tell me where you are a little more to knock it but you see these were just a few who came never nobody but you're with us in the meetings there were many more that did not come up and then from there we went to up another place called iriri but when they took individual iridi now it really we had more than 500 people who came and sat on under a very huge tree and it was just beautiful i wish that this was working i don't know what's happening you know it was just beautiful looking so beautiful well you just go on youtube and see that later and also this is on the website the website jvd those of you who can access the internet organic internet so even this uh presentation is there you can be able to see it in a presentation there is a church in ireland that they are constructing worldwide some illegal immigrants they're almost finishing it by the way and the pastor told told us they needed about uh two point five million malibu targaryen so some people they gave some money from nebraska uh and yesterday i sent uh brother uh his name is uh i'm sorry i can't remember his name from ireland we went to contido we traveled a leading they took in the cottido contido brother this thing it was quite an amazing time but it was very hard to go there so it was quite uh difficult for us to get there challenge is even your gained are you because the road to cortido is very bad there but god saved us and we went through it gently um and now to come from contido again was another big hustle so one brother sent me a video after we and he sent me a video where water was just oh it had almost cleared all the roads now whenever it rains people die brilliant because they have to cross and they think they will cross the water and they want to justify that and so the brothers some of the brothers wanted me to drive through such a road the land is very flat in sierra you're not a flat you know so the roads are flat [Music] so we had to sleep in a place called uh uh where was that yes so we found a place there and we spent in a beam traffic and then in the morning we we traveled we started our journey to uh soros so i want to bring greetings to you from the believers in matan amatani in kotido kotido in abim we met the pastor there trusting in they all send their greetings amen i mean so we

flesh but after the spirit for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh god sending his own son in the likeness of his sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the

meeting you're born a sinner no kidding unto us everybody admitting you need him no kidding to your waiter to serve you admitting you accept his christ no kids and your kids are searching and confessing it with your mouth no chat will not come out and [Applause] anymore you will walk after the spirit come we need them the way you see things and get each other it will not be the way your clan says the way you do things get up to marry now who are second you mean you have to get one away yes crazy you're just smiling you just can't understand together praise the lord come here i remember when i was in school you could have been in church who have known me for a long time they would say we are waiting for the girl you will marry me but would you even marry her where you are and the way you talk about it will believe in you that's why it's only christ that can put a marriage together and if you want to start a relationship without christ you are very in a very sort of state of time because [Music] how do you expect if foreign we should go to god [Music] how many believe that hallelujah amen but people go to bastards you look for something that would look for from the lord or none even to be bending on yourself preachers [Applause] jesus christ hallelujah amen he's the one who knows everything we are going to feel back we all need to go back this bible it is god's word we preachers we are here to tell you what the bible says watching trauma say why am i excited because this spirit is upon me he's the one telling you what is here hallelujah amen i'm just on my opening scriptures and i thought i was going to preach for only 30 minutes knows for those who are in christ jesus christ who believe in him as personal lord and savior you must believe in him as your personal [Applause] before you do when jesus died on the cross yesterday [Music] some of you have not got it yet meaning it is not my work see because i don't have to do something silly not bad coaching but it is what will i hear that deed on the cross hallelujah amen imagine someone killed somebody and then you come to him do you believe jesus it's not even [Applause] [Applause] m describes the blessedness of the mind and to whom god imputed righteousness without works here come in front here where are you oh god bless you so much hallelujah you're going to get a blessing listen what is that here we have our chief assistant but he is what god speaks of he says he describes you again as a woman and who go unto whom god unto you a great group with god catholic imputed righteousness amen amen hallelujah i mean are you not so glad if he was a man [Applause] [Music] hey can you say yes and what she's called foreign we now that you came up that we attempted to talk about including sexual temptation that jesus yes our god when he came in including b hmm was it charlie when the woman came oh my way yeah yeah and every man wanted to stone her um the man wanted to destroy her [Music] so but i'm reading the scripture and i'm reading between the lines you must have been tempted for a moment i said i'm just thinking out aloud but then could it have been that much when the woman came with buttons you know sometimes women can be so emotional so then jesus yes he now meets that woman nothing and the woman comes because they're the one who became seen hey the bible says he was touched i believe him by your coming what caught the feelings of our infection for faith all the temptation that we attempted and he came of your name [Applause] sin i love the amplified version hallelujah so he will not impute sin to us why not because we are better than others but because we have believed it the moment you accept christ as your savior and you believe in him no more baptized no baptism in his name not in trinity but in his name from that moment he does not impute sin unto you amen it is by receiving christ by faith in the world he says bible jesus for the law of the spirit of life and in brackets he says which is in christ jesus [Music] because you've grown up with it you know because it is according to your country but as long as you are here you want you are governed by the love you want to take care of you you have a new president [Music] for what the law could not do that is it could not overcome sin cuban a taker and we were being weakened by the flesh catify between tuna for years that is man is nature without the holy spirit i'm reading the bible at that time that god did that he said his own son yahweh is your man away in the likeness of sinful man as an offering where are you for sin or where to be oh goodness amen he had to come in the flesh yeah you know that movie so daddy can never come here for me and you know he of his own sangha chihuahuan that's why the whole bible is about jesus christ because it was in jesus christ that sin [Music] so we already b so that the righteous and just require me listen first so that the right yes and just this is important requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us okay who do not live our lives in the ways of the flesh meaning guided by wilderness and our sinfulness now that's the way of life that if why are you walking in the spirit who are you tamari you fool i told you the money runs on the quest don't play with me i will break you up [Music] foreign the scripture teaches [Music] of jesus [Applause] many believers you remember the story of the boy that was pardoned by the president in america there had been a young man who had killed someone my america and the father of the praise the lord he has already given us grace and mercy when the [Music] when the it means my whole life hallelujah [Applause] i put it right before god jesus subdued sin yes we are forgetting to be once and forever yeah so that i i want to know my own life sin can never subdue it [Music] so what do i say then teaching number father alone let's continue further we will know all about it will father alone my brother and sister tonight [Music] and [Music] tell someone when you fall down one more time come on when you fall [Music] now i'm approaching [Music] he totally delivered the world from sin and see hallelujah amen when he died at the day of the atonement where you are up daughter so there is no need for us to live under is [Music] castle so there is no need for us to live under privilege there is no need for us to live in a different state and he subdued them under his feet amina he put all amen of the principalities and powers of the devil under his feet now he wants to get in the eyes spokesman we will see him here that is play sir hallelujah he's passing it to you you capture the principalities [Music] he is completely defeated [Music] jesus
