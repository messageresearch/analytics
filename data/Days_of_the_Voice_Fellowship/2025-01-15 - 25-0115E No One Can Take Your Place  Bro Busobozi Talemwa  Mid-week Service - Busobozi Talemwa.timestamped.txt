[56:37] services every time I could open my
[56:40] mouth to start praying I end up
[56:45] speaking instead and when the service
[56:48] ended all I could do was laugh and laugh
[56:54] and I remember I remained laughing I
[56:57] remained laughing alone in
[57:01] church for some good
[57:05] time when my heart from the inside
[57:07] couldn't
[57:10] stop I just couldn't
[57:12] control and the spirit of the Lord kept
[57:14] telling me that the convention was to
[57:16] let us know that our prayers and
[57:18] petitions have been heard
[57:27] and he is manifesting them
[57:30] [Music]

[1:02:52] Sunday and then I travel back on Monday
[1:02:55] morning
[1:02:56] so uh just please keep us in
[1:02:59] prayer so today I just want to share on
[1:03:02] something
[1:03:03] small since I'm not preaching to you on
[1:03:07] Sunday I figed I should speak to you
[1:03:11] today I'm speaking on a little subject
[1:03:14] of no one can take your
[1:03:20] place turn to your neighbor and tell
[1:03:22] them no one can take your place
[1:03:26] Jesus said my sheep hear my
[1:03:28] voice and they know them and they follow
[1:03:32] me and I give unto them eternal
[1:03:35] life and they shall never perish neither
[1:03:39] shall any man pluck them out of my
[1:03:42] hand and another scripture says I've
[1:03:44] inscribed you in the palm of my
[1:03:48] hand it comes to show that every child
[1:03:51] of God that comes to
[1:03:53] God he's not misplaced
[1:03:57] I am not
[1:03:59] misplaced my sound is not really good
[1:04:01] this evening tell your neighbor I am not
[1:04:05] misplaced I cannot be
[1:04:07] misplaced tell them I will never be
[1:04:10] misplaced hallelujah amen we are in the
[1:04:13] palm of God's
[1:04:15] hand and we can never be
[1:04:18] misplaced and we can never
[1:04:21] perish amen he said no one can plock us
[1:04:25] out
[1:04:27] you know pling Out means like something
[1:04:30] is already embedded inside so you can't
[1:04:31] PL it
[1:04:37] out and you PL it out so now Jesus is
[1:04:41] saying his
[1:04:43] elect they are in the palm of his
[1:04:46] hands and no one can PL them
[1:04:51] out I cannot be pled out
[1:04:55] he has placed
[1:04:57] me I am there
[1:05:01] permanently amen you know why I'm
[1:05:03] sharing on this tonight there many
[1:05:06] people who when they see God using
[1:05:10] someone they feel that ah now someone
[1:05:14] has has replaced
[1:05:16] me one thing that has helped me in my
[1:05:20] life and uh in
[1:05:23] Ministry is I do not compete with
[1:05:31] anyone I never
[1:05:34] compete and I tell you this helps you it
[1:05:37] will help you in your dayto
[1:05:42] life you do NE never compete with
[1:05:50] anyone each of us is
[1:05:54] special each of us has a a a certain
[1:05:57] role a certain work that God has placed
[1:05:59] for
[1:06:03] us and you know when God places you in a
[1:06:06] a
[1:06:08] position he puts what we call maybe you
[1:06:11] can call it a
[1:06:13] gift and that
[1:06:16] gift says God's gifts will always find
[1:06:19] their
[1:06:22] place if it is a gift of God it will
[1:06:26] always find its
[1:06:27] place and you know this will help you
[1:06:30] not only in
[1:06:31] Ministry but also in your day-to-day
[1:06:35] life sometimes it is Siblings at
[1:06:39] home you know uh excuse me brother Dixon
[1:06:43] I wonder I think this is just off or
[1:06:46] something sorry sometimes it's hard to
[1:06:48] preach when you can't hear yourself you
[1:06:50] use a lot of
[1:06:52] strength and that's why we always have
[1:06:54] to tell this brother to tune uh you know
[1:06:56] we just came from the
[1:06:59] camp and some of these things are just
[1:07:01] getting
[1:07:05] tuned
[1:07:07] amen so um sometimes at
[1:07:11] home how many are here with their
[1:07:13] siblings raise up your
[1:07:18] hand oh how many have siblings raise up
[1:07:21] hand even me I have
[1:07:23] siblings you see many times when you're
[1:07:25] growing up at
[1:07:27] home you know there is
[1:07:31] jealousy jealousy that comes out if
[1:07:33] maybe a parent gives someone
[1:07:36] something you feel it should have been
[1:07:39] yours and you begin to cry so that you
[1:07:43] can also get it you know I've seen it
[1:07:46] among my children many times and you
[1:07:48] know you may even give them theirs and
[1:07:51] when you bring something else they begin
[1:07:54] crying they weren exactly the
[1:07:57] same and that's why you have seen many
[1:07:59] people sometimes especially younger
[1:08:01] children wearing the same color of
[1:08:04] [Music]
[1:08:05] clothes same type of of
[1:08:08] shoes same
[1:08:10] dress because there is competition
[1:08:13] somewhere they want to feel that they
[1:08:16] all
[1:08:18] equal they want to
[1:08:20] feel that they are all no one is above
[1:08:24] the other
[1:08:25] and the moment they even
[1:08:27] feel that they above someone is above
[1:08:30] them then they will not be happy you
[1:08:34] know so but I want to show you tonight
[1:08:37] that no one can take your
[1:08:39] place and you see that sometimes you
[1:08:42] even find in the work of the
[1:08:45] ministry when people begin
[1:08:49] competing you know say well I'm going to
[1:08:52] H so and so s a special song
[1:08:55] I I'm going to train I'm going to
[1:08:59] practice and I will when I begin
[1:09:02] singing everyone will know I'm the
[1:09:04] singer
[1:09:06] here so when I begin hearing oh so I'm
[1:09:09] sing so well no they don't know they
[1:09:12] don't know me when they hear about me
[1:09:15] that's when they know there is a
[1:09:16] sing
[1:09:20] competition did you know even preachers
[1:09:22] compete
[1:09:25] especially younger
[1:09:27] preachers they want to show that they
[1:09:30] better than somebody else singers same
[1:09:33] song leaders the same thing ministers
[1:09:36] same thing Believers same thing even
[1:09:40] sometimes churches
[1:09:43] compete and we want to make it like
[1:09:45] football
[1:09:48] teams you've had people say oh our
[1:09:50] church is the best
[1:09:51] chur there is nothing like that in
[1:09:54] Christ
[1:09:56] there's only one one who is
[1:09:58] better and that is Jesus Christ and when
[1:10:01] he is in your heart you will never
[1:10:04] compete with
[1:10:06] anyone there is a secret in finding your
[1:10:09] place in
[1:10:11] Christ there is
[1:10:12] a a very important uh what I would call
[1:10:17] an
[1:10:19] opportunity when you understand your
[1:10:22] calling and you understand last time I
[1:10:25] preach on your purpose in
[1:10:27] life and you understand why you are
[1:10:32] born you receive the revelation of your
[1:10:36] purpose the moment you receive that in
[1:10:39] life you do not care who does
[1:10:42] what you do not care who said what about
[1:10:45] you you don't mind what comes and what
[1:10:49] goes you focus on your
[1:10:53] calling amen it's just like a
[1:10:57] housewife who is not
[1:10:59] satisfied nothing can ever satisfy
[1:11:02] her if she feels you know there are
[1:11:05] women like that especially in the world
[1:11:09] even sometimes in the church you know
[1:11:12] when she she's always
[1:11:14] insecure thinking whenever the man goes
[1:11:17] out he's going to get another one when
[1:11:20] he's talking to a
[1:11:22] woman now now he's going to oh he has
[1:11:25] sent a
[1:11:26] message let me see let me see what's
[1:11:29] happening what did he say you know she's
[1:11:32] insecure she always feels someone will
[1:11:36] take her
[1:11:38] place you know that
[1:11:41] insecurity comes from a lack of
[1:11:46] understanding of who you
[1:11:49] are but the moment you receive a
[1:11:52] revelation that look I am married to
[1:11:54] this man
[1:11:56] he had all his
[1:11:58] chances he left all the
[1:12:01] others for me for me he came to my
[1:12:06] Village for me he paid my
[1:12:09] bright for me he publicly
[1:12:13] announced that he loves me for me you
[1:12:16] know he made my Village
[1:12:19] check for
[1:12:22] me he has we have a marriage certificate
[1:12:25] we had a wedding for me so therefore I
[1:12:29] don't care who these people are that
[1:12:32] even dress and walk
[1:12:34] around so that he can see them I know my
[1:12:38] place I am not a girl friend I am his
[1:12:43] wife praise the name of the Lord I am
[1:12:46] his wife and you know women like my wife
[1:12:49] knows her
[1:12:51] place sometimes I travel countries go
[1:12:54] away
[1:12:55] for weeks and weeks and you know should
[1:12:57] not ask me who did you talk to
[1:13:00] today I'm going to come to check your
[1:13:03] phone when
[1:13:04] you I mean my wife has has my
[1:13:07] password I have a password we can always
[1:13:11] see what each other is
[1:13:13] talking if we want we can do it for fun
[1:13:18] but not for
[1:13:19] checking is someone taking my place when
[1:13:22] you get that attitude
[1:13:25] lose
[1:13:26] focus on whatever you are
[1:13:29] doing so when I'm
[1:13:32] abroad she's just so you know
[1:13:36] comfortable in our home knowing I am
[1:13:40] hers and she is
[1:13:43] mine in the same way Jesus Christ wants
[1:13:48] us to understand whatever he designed us
[1:13:51] to
[1:13:52] be and whatever we are in his
[1:13:56] economy no man can take your
[1:14:00] place but the question is do you know
[1:14:02] your
[1:14:04] place and he said and they shall never
[1:14:08] perish I'll give them eternal
[1:14:11] life neither shall any man pluck them
[1:14:13] out of my
[1:14:15] hand my Father which gave them
[1:14:18] me is greater than
[1:14:20] all and no
[1:14:23] man can everyone say no
[1:14:26] man is
[1:14:28] able to PL them
[1:14:33] out of my father's
[1:14:36] hand and in Hebrews chapter 2 brother
[1:14:38] says think of it
[1:14:41] brother my sheep hear my
[1:14:44] voice and a stranger they won't
[1:14:47] follow oh how that our names are on the
[1:14:50] palm of his
[1:14:52] hands it is before him
[1:14:55] day and night his word is always before
[1:14:59] him his promise he cannot forget and he
[1:15:04] loves you now he will bear witness of
[1:15:07] his
[1:15:08] own you don't open your mouth and say a
[1:15:13] word the world will know something has
[1:15:16] happened to
[1:15:18] you praise the name of the Lord he knows
[1:15:21] his
[1:15:22] sheep I am the Sheep of his pastor
[1:15:27] uh can you open 1 Corinthians 12:
[1:15:46] 20 1 Corinthians
[1:15:53] 12: says
[1:15:56] but now are they many members yet one
[1:16:06] body and the eye cannot say unto the
[1:16:09] hand I have no need of
[1:16:12] [Music]
[1:16:15] thee nor again the hand to the feet I
[1:16:20] have no need of you
[1:16:31] vers2 much more those members of the
[1:16:35] body which seem to be more feeble are
[1:16:47] necessary and those members of the body
[1:16:50] which we think to be less honorable upon
[1:16:53] these we bestow more abundant honor and
[1:16:57] our uncomely parts have more abundant
[1:17:22] cess for our parts have no need but God
[1:17:27] has tempered the body
[1:17:29] together having given more abant honor
[1:17:32] to that part which
[1:17:48] lacked that there should be no shm in
[1:17:51] the body but that members should have
[1:17:53] the same care one for another
[1:17:55] and whether one member suffer all
[1:17:57] members suffer with it or one member be
[1:18:00] honored all the members Rejoice with
[1:18:09] [Music]
[1:18:21] it praise the name of the Lord in
[1:18:25] another part of the
[1:18:27] scripture the Bible speaks of
[1:18:30] vessels there are different
[1:18:33] vessels praise the name of the
[1:18:36] Lord I didn't plan to read that but let
[1:18:38] me find it out
[1:18:43] here uh first second
[1:18:48] Timothy Chapter
[1:18:52] 2 we read from vers 19
[1:18:56] nevertheless the foundation of God
[1:18:58] standeth sure having this seal the Lord
[1:19:01] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:19:03] everyone that nameth the name of the
[1:19:05] Christ depart from
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:19] iniquity but in a great house there are
[1:19:22] not only vessels of gold and of silver
[1:19:25] but also of wood and of Earth and some
[1:19:28] to honor and some to
[1:19:42] dishonor if a man that Pur himself from
[1:19:45] these he shall be a vessel unto honor
[1:19:49] Sanctified and meat for the Master's use
[1:19:52] and prepared unto every good work
[1:20:07] flee also youthful lusts but follow
[1:20:09] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[1:20:11] them that call on the name of the Lord
[1:20:13] of a pure heart
[1:20:29] the master wants to use all of
[1:20:31] us but for you to be a vessel of
[1:20:35] Honor you must have purified
[1:20:39] yourself you must have prepared
[1:20:41] yourself you remember brother bham was
[1:20:44] one of the actually is the vessel of hor
[1:20:46] in our
[1:20:48] generation from when he was a child you
[1:20:51] know when he was I think seven years old
[1:20:55] you know in that when he was going to
[1:20:57] bring water to go and give to his father
[1:21:00] to prepare
[1:21:04] moonshine you see you know the voice
[1:21:06] spoke to him out of a
[1:21:08] tree and you know he's born in a family
[1:21:12] of
[1:21:13] drunkards the father is a drunkard he
[1:21:16] makes
[1:21:17] alcohol and and he's going to fetch
[1:21:21] water so that he can you know serve his
[1:21:24] father the water and then they make the
[1:21:27] mo but God had a plan for
[1:21:30] him just like I believe God has a plan
[1:21:32] for many of you
[1:21:34] tonight just like God had a plan for
[1:21:37] me and a voice came out of that tree out
[1:21:41] of the
[1:21:42] wildwind and spoke to him and he said
[1:21:46] called his name so he was
[1:21:50] startled so you know when God calls you
[1:21:54] there is a
[1:21:56] purpose there is a
[1:21:59] purpose and a voice
[1:22:01] said let me tell you before I continue
[1:22:04] There are many who have heard this
[1:22:06] message but they simply walk away but
[1:22:09] you came you answered the call Now find
[1:22:13] the purpose of God for your
[1:22:16] life find the purpose of God what does
[1:22:19] God want you to do in the
[1:22:21] body what work does he want you to do in
[1:22:24] the body
[1:22:26] which Duty find it you cannot be in the
[1:22:30] body and you are not a useful
[1:22:34] part you know what he does to useless
[1:22:38] Parts you remember how what he did to
[1:22:40] that
[1:22:41] tree he cast it why because it did not
[1:22:44] produce
[1:22:46] FR but now remember this it was not the
[1:22:49] time for that tree to produce
[1:22:53] fruit it was the
[1:22:55] season of the tree to bear fruit was it
[1:23:01] it was not but he required
[1:23:05] fruit so in other words it was his
[1:23:09] season not the Tre
[1:23:11] season when God brings you the
[1:23:14] word it is God's season for that word
[1:23:18] which has been preached to you to be
[1:23:19] made
[1:23:21] manifest so you must always respond
[1:23:25] you must always design that this is God
[1:23:26] speaking to
[1:23:28] me and you accept that word for that
[1:23:32] moment because if you miss it you will
[1:23:35] miss your purpose in
[1:23:36] life and you see by the B you know the
[1:23:39] angel came out of
[1:23:42] the spoke to and called name and said
[1:23:47] never
[1:23:48] drink Never
[1:23:50] Smoke defile your
[1:23:52] body in
[1:23:54] way there is a work for you to
[1:23:59] do when you get
[1:24:01] older seven
[1:24:03] years seven years how old are
[1:24:08] you seven years he
[1:24:11] was God calls you and God calls
[1:24:15] you some of you have been turning
[1:24:19] down for years maybe in this little
[1:24:23] service
[1:24:24] you will accept that
[1:24:26] call seven years he
[1:24:29] work you know he had many times we
[1:24:32] preach and say oh it's not what we do
[1:24:33] it's what he
[1:24:36] does because he had to be a ver of
[1:24:40] hor he had to make a
[1:24:43] sacrifice and turn down
[1:24:46] things other young people were not
[1:24:48] turning
[1:24:49] down he to turn down
[1:24:52] girlfriends you had to turn down
[1:24:55] you had to turn down cigarettes you had
[1:24:57] to turn down
[1:24:59] everything because of the calling which
[1:25:01] was upon his life these are things when
[1:25:04] they enter into your
[1:25:05] life they frustrate the call of God and
[1:25:08] the purpose of God for your
[1:25:13] life amen and you know but when you
[1:25:16] answer the
[1:25:17] call like like Abraham answer the he
[1:25:21] stayed away from everything
[1:25:25] including his family
[1:25:28] things God called him to walk
[1:25:32] away and um brother bam when God called
[1:25:35] him he walked away and and and submitted
[1:25:40] his entire
[1:25:43] life to that calling of
[1:25:46] God and later on when he grew he
[1:25:49] realized God was using him in a special
[1:25:52] way he realized you know there were
[1:25:55] things he was understanding that you
[1:25:57] know the other denomination of people
[1:25:58] were are not
[1:26:02] understanding even his
[1:26:05] Pastor I don't remember his name someone
[1:26:08] if you remember his name
[1:26:10] tell he was in the Baptist
[1:26:13] Church and you know this pastor told him
[1:26:17] because he was a minister in the
[1:26:19] church he told him now you're going to
[1:26:21] ordain a woman preacher
[1:26:25] so you see he went to read the
[1:26:28] Bible but whatever you could find
[1:26:31] there was not allowing him to do
[1:26:35] it he read in second in first
[1:26:39] Timothy which says I forbid a woman to
[1:26:41] accept authority over a
[1:26:44] man to teach to accept authority over a
[1:26:47] man and when he read that it's like but
[1:26:51] now also he says here that a bishop must
[1:26:53] be hband of one wife ruling his own
[1:26:56] house
[1:26:57] well how then can I ordain a woman
[1:27:01] preacher he stayed with the word and you
[1:27:05] know the church could not stay with
[1:27:07] him when you stay with the word you will
[1:27:10] lose friendship
[1:27:12] sometimes when you answer the call there
[1:27:16] will always be a
[1:27:18] Separation by the way let me tell you
[1:27:21] that every man in the Bible
[1:27:25] who has answered the
[1:27:27] call had a separation
[1:27:31] somewhere tell me anyone that answered
[1:27:33] any
[1:27:35] call and never had a
[1:27:37] separation Abraham separated with his
[1:27:41] people John separated with his parents
[1:27:44] do you know John's father and mother
[1:27:46] were
[1:27:49] PRS but when he was called and he
[1:27:52] answered the call he had leave he left
[1:27:55] the temple he left the home and he went
[1:27:58] to the bush he began eating honey and
[1:28:01] and and honey
[1:28:04] and why because he answered the call
[1:28:08] talk about William brared with his
[1:28:11] family with his church you know you can
[1:28:14] give me another example talk about David
[1:28:18] David his entire life was all about
[1:28:21] separation he separated with the you
[1:28:23] know his family the moment he was
[1:28:27] anointed that anointing took him in the
[1:28:30] palace even when he reached the palace
[1:28:33] sa wanted to kill him that same
[1:28:35] anointing had to separate him again and
[1:28:38] took him somewhere until he became a
[1:28:41] king if God calls you and you accept
[1:28:45] that calling into the your God called
[1:28:49] position there must be a
[1:28:52] separation sometimes God is calling you
[1:28:54] to be a
[1:28:55] wife of someone you cannot be a wife of
[1:28:59] someone and remain with all the who and
[1:29:02] things he used to
[1:29:04] do the friends and you know there must
[1:29:07] be a
[1:29:08] separation but the problem is many
[1:29:11] people don't want to
[1:29:13] separate they want to
[1:29:16] separate so we see here I'm talking
[1:29:19] about your your
[1:29:21] place by the way there is nothing more
[1:29:25] beautiful in this life that knowing your
[1:29:31] place one of the man the men that
[1:29:34] mentored
[1:29:37] me
[1:29:38] Bishop the WR Dr
[1:29:44] Bishop you know they have many
[1:29:47] titles in the Anglican
[1:29:50] Church I loved it the way he spoke
[1:29:54] he called a SP a
[1:29:56] SP when you ask him his opinion about
[1:30:00] politics whether or not he can join
[1:30:03] politics you know he would answer you
[1:30:06] quickly oh no for us we are called into
[1:30:09] Ministry and minister is life of
[1:30:12] service like oh I love that but
[1:30:15] sometimes you find ministers who are to
[1:30:18] and fr he's standing for political
[1:30:21] position here is preaching is doing this
[1:30:25] he wants to be a
[1:30:27] businessman brother when God calls you
[1:30:29] to do
[1:30:30] something he will make a way for you to
[1:30:32] do it and accomplish
[1:30:34] it just stay in your God
[1:30:38] position many times when God calls a
[1:30:41] man he doesn't tell him how he will be
[1:30:44] able to accomplish the
[1:30:46] [Music]
[1:30:47] work but he simply calls you and he says
[1:30:51] go but he has not told you where you
[1:30:57] he told Elijah Elijah go you will find a
[1:31:01] brook and he will eat from there so he
[1:31:05] was Wonder I mean if if a man was
[1:31:07] supposed to ask
[1:31:09] questions would have had a million
[1:31:12] questions who will cook for me there
[1:31:15] will there be food from what will happen
[1:31:18] water alone will I drink that what if it
[1:31:22] dries but you see
[1:31:24] when you know God has called you and you
[1:31:27] have accepted the call you become crazy
[1:31:31] even when you have no
[1:31:33] answers you just say Amen Lord I will do
[1:31:36] just what you have told me to
[1:31:38] do and a man walked and he went to that
[1:31:42] Brook he walked and walked and walk God
[1:31:45] never gave him
[1:31:47] Direction God never told him the town
[1:31:49] where the BR
[1:31:52] is but he walked just keep walking with
[1:31:56] the
[1:31:57] word you will find your
[1:31:59] place of your calling and when he
[1:32:03] arrived there he found the water ah he
[1:32:06] rejoiced he was very thirsty he began
[1:32:09] drinking and then he just sat there God
[1:32:13] told me to stay here but I don't know
[1:32:15] what I will eat but I believe him and
[1:32:18] little by
[1:32:20] little Revelation began coming you know
[1:32:23] revelation manest
[1:32:25] himself I'm sure he must have believed
[1:32:28] come to a place where I was like but God
[1:32:31] is able to provide food from
[1:32:33] nowhere and maybe as soon as he said
[1:32:36] that a raven
[1:32:41] came and came with
[1:32:44] food
[1:32:45] R of all
[1:32:48] birs where did the food come
[1:32:51] from where did the food come from
[1:32:55] have you ever thought
[1:32:56] about I believe it must have been like
[1:33:00] where the mana come
[1:33:04] from it must have come from
[1:33:07] Heaven that was more than a
[1:33:11] ren that was an angel of the
[1:33:14] Lord but he hum
[1:33:17] himself
[1:33:19] amen you
[1:33:21] know God hiding himself in
[1:33:25] Simplicity and revealing himself in the
[1:33:29] same don't look for big things when
[1:33:31] you're looking for
[1:33:33] God look for simple things when you are
[1:33:35] looking for
[1:33:37] God that is how God
[1:33:39] moves that's how God
[1:33:42] speaks and that R came the angel of the
[1:33:45] Lord came he didn't come with a sword
[1:33:48] and
[1:33:49] Pur but he came just for a specific
[1:33:52] reason
[1:33:54] in a way he least
[1:33:56] expected but you know that is a flying
[1:34:00] bird praise the name of the Lord God
[1:34:03] will provide for
[1:34:04] you in a way you least
[1:34:08] expected just keep believing him and you
[1:34:11] know he drunk and drunk and drunk and
[1:34:14] Rens kept on coming but the same God who
[1:34:17] provides in a
[1:34:19] way he will provide in
[1:34:22] another God is Not
[1:34:24] limed tell your neighbor God is not
[1:34:27] limited when one door
[1:34:29] closes another door will always open
[1:34:33] because our God is all the all
[1:34:36] sufficient
[1:34:37] one Our God Amen cannot be
[1:34:41] quenched is
[1:34:43] unquenchable the flow will
[1:34:46] flow until his purpose has been
[1:34:50] accomplished in my life in your life you
[1:34:54] know he always teaches us to have
[1:34:56] faith and it came to a moment where the
[1:35:00] brook
[1:35:02] dried but Elijah kept
[1:35:04] trusting and another time when
[1:35:07] everything was dry now he told him now
[1:35:11] now my
[1:35:12] servant I love trusting
[1:35:15] God he's so sweet trust in
[1:35:19] Jesus and to depend upon his

[1:35:36] Jesus it is so sweet to depend on
[1:35:40] him don't depend on your husband don't
[1:35:43] depend on your father don't depend on

[1:35:47] your
[1:35:47] sister your wife your father your mother
[1:35:51] come on let us depend on on
[1:35:55] God that same God will use
[1:35:59] anything he will use
[1:36:01] anyone however way he wants to use
[1:36:06] them and he tells him now my
[1:36:10] servant I have a
[1:36:12] woman I have
[1:36:15] commanded to take care of
[1:36:19] you did you know God can command someone
[1:36:24] to take care of
[1:36:25] you your
[1:36:27] needs you just see someone willing to do
[1:36:30] something for you don't refuse receive
[1:36:34] it with joy and don't worship them
[1:36:37] worship the god you prayed
[1:36:41] toen
[1:36:43] hallelujah amen and you know I've
[1:36:46] commanded a widow
[1:36:47] woman to take care of you I've commanded
[1:36:51] her how did you command her
[1:36:54] not with a voice because when Elijah
[1:36:58] arrived at this place this WD woman
[1:37:02] never knew
[1:37:05] anything God is not a
[1:37:07] liar amen like Pastor Manda said God is
[1:37:12] not a
[1:37:13] man God is
[1:37:15] God and when he speaks his word has to
[1:37:19] happen and so he said I've commanded her
[1:37:23] to take care of you but when he arrived
[1:37:26] there she did not even know
[1:37:28] him she didn't even know about the
[1:37:31] Commandment
[1:37:35] receive let me tell you this here some
[1:37:39] of you are finished school and are
[1:37:40] looking for
[1:37:41] jobs and some of you have not even done
[1:37:44] school but you want
[1:37:46] jobs God has commanded someone to give
[1:37:48] you
[1:37:50] a God is the is the same yester
[1:37:55] amen and that person who is commanded
[1:37:57] does not even know
[1:37:59] it but God will make them
[1:38:02] understand and here when this woman
[1:38:04] arrived with this man arrived
[1:38:06] there he was speaking with
[1:38:10] authority you know when you you are just
[1:38:12] asking for
[1:38:13] help you you beg but he was not
[1:38:17] begging don't be a beggar
[1:38:21] 2025 because God has commanded someone
[1:38:23] to
[1:38:25] help amen he came and spoke with
[1:38:29] authority he said give me a glass of
[1:38:32] water as she was going also bring me
[1:38:35] some
[1:38:36] food said but I don't have food I only
[1:38:40] have for me and
[1:38:41] myself just do what I say bring me food
[1:38:46] and water and you know she did not know
[1:38:49] she was under
[1:38:51] commandment she had to obey
[1:38:54] because she was under
[1:38:55] commandment and you know when she went
[1:38:58] something spoke to her why don't you
[1:39:00] just do it that was God speaking rather
[1:39:04] you move by faith not by
[1:39:07] sight help will come when God wants it
[1:39:10] to
[1:39:14] come your answer will
[1:39:17] arrive as long as you move by
[1:39:19] faith Elijah answered the call
[1:39:23] and God led him all the way but Elijah
[1:39:27] had to separate
[1:39:29] himself well in the message come let us
[1:39:31] reasen
[1:39:32] together our Prophet says we all have
[1:39:34] different
[1:39:36] parts God has put the furniture in the
[1:39:40] house now watch the television say I
[1:39:44] will just not be a television no more if
[1:39:46] I can't be the ice

[1:39:57] in God and abide
[1:40:02] there abide there if you know me I'm an
[1:40:06] interpreter that is what I do and
[1:40:09] touches

[1:40:36] the the he wants to be everything and
[1:40:39] his fighting for everything and also
[1:40:41] when you talk to him or her they begin

[1:44:25] smiles when they are sad on the on the
[1:44:28] heart you can see it it's a plastic
[1:44:33] SM so you find even in in this
[1:44:36] generation you have a lot of women who
[1:44:38] have become
[1:44:39] plastic plastic hair plastic
[1:44:44] eyelids plastic

[1:45:09] there what if God Made You with an ear
[1:45:13] dangling like
[1:45:15] this would you have loved
[1:45:18] it but why do they do it they don't want
[1:45:21] to be original
[1:45:24] find yourself your dark
[1:45:26] skin you want to become
[1:45:29] light people don't appreciate each
[1:45:32] themselves she wants to go and get
[1:45:38] something and look like

[1:45:47] woman who told you a woman
[1:45:49] look a woman looks like you we all a
[1:45:52] flower garden of
[1:45:53] [Music]
[1:45:55] God is a god of
[1:45:57] variety and the way he made you is the
[1:46:00] way he wants you and the way he made you
[1:46:04] is the way you will fit in the puzzle
[1:46:06] you are supposed to fit
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:10] in if someone doesn't like you the way
[1:46:13] you
[1:46:14] are God has somebody who will like you
[1:46:17] the way you

[1:46:35] for when I found my
[1:46:38] wife you could not convince me other
[1:46:41] way there is another
[1:46:43] one I had seen her I had known this is
[1:46:48] exactly what I was looking
[1:46:51] for now when you begin to tell me she's
[1:46:54] not good she's not beautiful she's not
[1:46:57] this I would just laugh at you this is
[1:47:00] what I've been
[1:47:01] looking let me tell you because there is
[1:47:04] a deep calling there is a deep
[1:47:08] response the way you are is the way God
[1:47:11] wants
[1:47:12] you be
[1:47:15] original some of you
[1:47:17] sisters stop making worldly hair
[1:47:23] andal to the
[1:47:26] public you see stay away from
[1:47:31] those be
[1:47:33] natural be the way God wants you to be
[1:47:37] be the way God you know my wife you know
[1:47:40] before we got
[1:47:41] married ah I've already said
[1:47:45] it she used to put you know how is that
[1:47:48] thing
[1:47:50] called H something to make the the hair
[1:47:55] darker
[1:47:57] okay so I told her we were just in
[1:48:02] courtship what is it
[1:48:04] called she said die I asked her do you
[1:48:07] want to
[1:48:08] die can you see you killing the hair and
[1:48:12] from that day she quickly came to
[1:48:15] herself she no longer
[1:48:18] used if God has made your hair a little
[1:48:20] brown brown
[1:48:22] it is beautiful
[1:48:26] that yes sir it's beautiful that way
[1:48:31] others have dark dark
[1:48:33] hair others have reddish
[1:48:38] hair others have a bit
[1:48:40] short others have longer but the way God
[1:48:44] has made you don't try to be like
[1:48:47] somebody
[1:48:49] else be yourself
[1:48:52] no one can take your place and you
[1:48:55] shouldn't try to take someone else's
[1:48:58] place don't be
[1:49:00] plastic
[1:49:04] original praise
[1:49:08] God my amens are not very many
[1:49:12] today am I stepping on some people's
[1:49:19] toys hallelujah hallelujah
[1:49:23] he C now this is in the message part
[1:49:25] perfect Faith he C me when I was
[1:49:28] nothing he C me when I was
[1:49:31] nothing I want to say even me he caught
[1:49:34] me when I was nothing you know when God
[1:49:37] is catching you he doesn't catch you for
[1:49:40] what you you will
[1:49:42] become he catches you for what you
[1:49:45] are because he wants to make you
[1:49:47] something you know God is always in a
[1:49:50] business of wanting to make something
[1:49:53] nothing
[1:49:55] something so he always comes to
[1:49:59] nothing show me has God ever come to
[1:50:03] something where was Jesus
[1:50:07] born
[1:50:09] naare what good thing can come
[1:50:12] from everybody despised the place he
[1:50:15] came to
[1:50:17] nothing he came to
[1:50:19] nothing he came for who the perfect the
[1:50:24] good he came to the Sinners you remember
[1:50:27] that woman prostitute when she was you
[1:50:30] know leaking his
[1:50:31] feet and you know they said we wish he
[1:50:36] knew what kind of man of
[1:50:38] woman but he had them as as the master
[1:50:42] he had them are you not happy you Ser a
[1:50:46] master he had them amen he said you've
[1:50:51] not washed my feet
[1:50:53] but since I came here this woman has not
[1:50:57] ceased to cry and wash my feet with our
[1:51:00] tears you know what you're talking about
[1:51:03] he comes to
[1:51:04] nothing he came to that woman she was
[1:51:07] nothing he came to Rahab RAB was
[1:51:11] nothing why did he not come to the best
[1:51:13] person in
[1:51:15] that he came to RAB a
[1:51:19] prostitute nothing because always when
[1:51:24] he builds he doesn't want someone to
[1:51:26] take the
[1:51:27] glory so God wants to build you and he
[1:51:30] wants to be the only one to take the
[1:51:33] glory God wants to look at you and say
[1:51:38] behold my
[1:51:39] work my finished work that's why when he
[1:51:43] died on the cross he said it is finished
[1:51:46] what is finished he has already built
[1:51:48] his church he has laid the foundation
[1:51:52] fin this church and the church only
[1:51:54] comes by faith through his
[1:51:57] blood and I am the
[1:52:00] reason of that death on the
[1:52:02] cross it's not my works that will make
[1:52:06] me make
[1:52:07] it when I say I know I can make it not
[1:52:11] by my works but I'm meaning I am going
[1:52:15] to make it by faith in the finished work
[1:52:18] of the
[1:52:20] CR so you see I have nothing to burst
[1:52:23] off but I burst in his
[1:52:26] love I burst in his blood I burst in his
[1:52:31] grace so you see he can he C me when I
[1:52:36] was nothing allow him to catch you when
[1:52:40] you are nothing because he wants to
[1:52:42] build you to become
[1:52:46] something and brother bam says I'm still

[1:53:55] him so loved me till he stooped down to
[1:53:58] get me and pick me

[1:58:26] Visions watch how true he was no matter
[1:58:30] if it cost him his fellowship with his
