[1:07:30] and so there are many other preachers
[1:07:32] that you know have come up over the
[1:07:34] years and joined the Throne of those who
[1:07:37] have started and you know and the
[1:07:39] message has been preached
[1:07:46] I always say there are those the first
[1:07:49] generation preachers of the message the
[1:07:50] second generation the fat I don't know
[1:07:52] which generation I am maybe the seventh
[1:07:54] I don't know
[1:08:01] but in Uganda
[1:08:04] Uganda Pastor Steven is in the first
[1:08:06] generation amen
[1:08:11] uh he's here with his wife sister Sarah
[1:08:13] yeah
[1:08:15] and uh we have had also a marriage of
[1:08:18] many years they will tell us
[1:08:20] [Music]
[1:08:22] my wife and I uh always uh
[1:08:26] I don't I don't know the right word to
[1:08:28] use but uh
[1:08:30] I should say we always convey to have
[1:08:32] such a marriage that has been time
[1:08:34] tested
[1:08:43] and we appreciate you brother Steven and
[1:08:45] Sister Sarah
[1:08:48] for being an example to very many in our
[1:08:52] generation and
[1:08:57] um so I have had an opportunity to
[1:09:02] work closely with brother Stephen for a
[1:09:04] few years
[1:09:08] he invited me to minister also in his
[1:09:12] church a few years ago before I even
[1:09:14] became a pastor yeah
[1:09:20] before we even traveled to Ethiopia
[1:09:23] and I was very small body
[1:09:29] but he trusted me with his pulpits
[1:09:33] I hope I did not cause any damage
[1:09:37] but I want to say God bless you for that
[1:09:39] opportunity
[1:09:42] and uh so today you know when I invited
[1:09:46] him to come
[1:09:47] he was very gracious and he accepted the
[1:09:50] invitation
[1:09:54] I want to say that is
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:01] um
[1:10:04] our charge is just well about uh a year
[1:10:07] and a half can you say your face
[1:10:11] although we have a few that have come
[1:10:13] from other churches and so we have a few
[1:10:15] here who have also been in the message
[1:10:16] for quite some time
[1:10:22] and uh I know our students are all not
[1:10:26] here
[1:10:30] there are also some would stream with us
[1:10:33] and since we usually archive our
[1:10:36] services I believe that there will be
[1:10:38] many more who will hear the service
[1:10:40] today
[1:10:47] we are requesting you Pastor Steven to
[1:10:50] preach to us
[1:10:58] there is I believe much more in you
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:02] that we here in this Fellowship
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] is that right and
[1:11:11] um just have a hundred percent
[1:11:14] limited
[1:11:16] you are our father you know it's always
[1:11:19] a good uh to know you know Apple
[1:11:23] supports say that you do not have many
[1:11:24] fathers
[1:11:26] for those who went and established the
[1:11:29] message when I I've been I've had that
[1:11:31] opportunity in Ethiopia when there is
[1:11:33] completely no message
[1:11:42] it is very hard to start from nothing
[1:11:48] and so you should always respect those
[1:11:51] who start who do the rudimentary work
[1:11:57] there is always much in them that we can
[1:12:00] learn
[1:12:14] I would like you to also give a hundred
[1:12:17] percent attention
[1:12:21] we have one service so we want to give
[1:12:24] him as much time as he needs service
[1:12:28] we are not in a hurry
[1:12:32] that am I am I alone on that
[1:12:35] we are not in a hurry are we giving him
[1:12:39] as much time as he needs
[1:12:41] and so
[1:12:43] then I will know that you are doing that
[1:12:45] by saying Amen to everyone
[1:12:49] amen so without uh I would like us to
[1:12:53] stand and then we sing A Chorus as we

[1:13:08] was with us in Ethiopia Williams from
[1:13:12] Ethiopia
[1:13:13] and uh since I would not like the
[1:13:16] pastor's time to be taken when he comes
[1:13:19] I don't know he says no but come and
[1:13:21] greet us just one minute
[1:13:24] I traveled with him even to take right
[1:13:27] where there is a war now and uh

[1:25:39] Brothers

[1:25:48] when I listen to him when moon is a
[1:25:52] um
[1:25:53] there's almost nothing
[1:25:55] that you people would need more than him
[1:26:05] and as I stand here
[1:26:08] I promise I'm not going to say anything
[1:26:13] other than what he has the ability to
[1:26:16] say or what he has already said

[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:50] here I says
[1:26:53] but have renounced the hidden things of
[1:26:56] dishonest
[1:26:58] not walking in a craftiness nor handling
[1:27:02] the word of God deceitfully but by
[1:27:05] manifestation of the truth commanding
[1:27:08] ourselves to Every Man's conscience in
[1:27:12] the sight of God
[1:27:15] is
[1:27:30] [Music]
[1:27:36] blessing the reading of this word
[1:27:44] this verse
[1:27:47] cause us to renounce the kind of things
[1:27:51] foreign
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:13] [Music]
[1:28:27] it is heed to them that are lost
[1:28:41] in whom the God of this world has
[1:28:44] blinded the minds of them which believe
[1:28:48] not
[1:28:49] lest the light of the Glorious gospel of
[1:28:53] Christ who is the image of God should
[1:28:57] shine unto
[1:28:59] themes
[1:29:14] so when we denounce the hidden fee
[1:29:18] between
[1:29:20] there is a light that glows out to the
[1:29:24] world
[1:29:27] because your Christ's life
[1:29:32] is the light to the world
[1:29:39] so verse 5 here
[1:29:42] for we preach not ourselves
[1:29:51] we are not the film of the Gospel
[1:29:58] We Don't Preach ourselves into your
[1:30:01] souls

[1:30:37] but Christ Jesus the Lord when will a
[1:30:42] Christian yes and ourselves your
[1:30:46] servants for Jesus sake
[1:30:51] for God you commanded the light to shine
[1:30:54] out of Darkness foreign
[1:31:20] [Music]
[1:31:50] [Music]
[1:32:16] but we have this light
[1:32:20] in action vessels
[1:32:23] that the Excellency
[1:32:25] of the power may be of God and not of us
[1:32:42] amen did you hear that
[1:32:45] sometimes you may not know what you have
[1:32:50] but the light that brought life in the
[1:32:53] darkness
[1:32:59] now Paul says that has taken a veil
[1:33:04] of men that have been Justified

[1:39:54] and literally Locust means the spirit
[1:39:59] logo street again

[1:40:10] in other words he took what will refer
[1:40:14] to as the world body
[1:40:18] is
[1:40:29] because he's condescending
[1:40:32] is coming from that Spirit invisibility
[1:40:39] to a spirit visibility
[1:40:43] and the spirit visibility
[1:40:46] was what we call the world that is
[1:41:20] he wanted to reflect himself command he
[1:41:23] was going to make it yeah
[1:41:35] he used to live in the same direction
[1:41:38] with God
[1:41:40] because he did not have a body of Flesh
[1:41:51] the spirit of inspiration
[1:41:55] with the Holy Spirit leads to deliver
[1:41:57] today
[1:42:03] yes sir I mean but when it came to town
[1:42:16] hallelujah amen then God said I'm going
[1:42:20] to make this man here
[1:42:27] bring him into dimension of Flesh
