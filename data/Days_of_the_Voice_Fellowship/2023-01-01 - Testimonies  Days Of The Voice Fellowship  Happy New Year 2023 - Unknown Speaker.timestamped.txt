[40:59] Chapel but I would go and Japan
[41:03] [Music]
[41:15] I remember one time
[41:17] it was a life-changing moment for me
[41:23] I got a friend no I used to go into the
[41:26] chapel again
[41:36] everyone would even if you get someone
[41:39] who has never prayed yeah
[41:43] two weeks to your name or a week
[41:46] and find people in the chapel over

[42:07] praying seriously
[42:09] this time I was walking in Chapel with
[42:12] my friends
[42:17] he was just joining us
[42:21] I think it was supposed to go for a
[42:23] discussion so he said yeah you know
[42:24] discussion
[42:26] so let us go to Japan and you shall come
[42:29] back together with Chapel for him
[42:33] I was working with them um
[42:43] I have something to tell you
[42:47] and they said
[42:49] they're going to tell us
[42:53] something else University
[42:55] [Music]
[42:58] you can tell someone you love them
[43:04] but this surprised me
[43:09] what I was supposed to was I love God
[43:11] very much
[43:14] I realized there was a connection
[43:21] video
[43:36] um
[43:39] I'm wearing the statue feeling me the
[43:41] Holy Spirit
[43:44] I'm going to request you not to clap
[43:46] yeah
[43:49] because it may be sad or upset
[43:59] so during the sector convention the last
[44:02] day petroleum
[44:05] when they called
[44:07] um people who wanted to receive the
[44:09] audience
[44:11] so I knelt down your nailed down like in
[44:15] front of the projector
[44:18] projector so I was praying I told God so
[44:22] the beginning of life I've been
[44:24] reminding God all these things
[44:37] and this was for last year yeah
[44:44] God you keep your promises
[44:48] from the first from the
[44:50] from first January
[44:54] I know I've done a lot of mistakes
[45:06] then I felt a hit name
[45:15] it covered
[45:18] a lot of stuff but I I felt Wicked
[45:26] and then I went on my hands like I was
[45:29] kneeling
[45:36] so later
[45:50] it was from
[45:58] a project
[46:01] so
[46:04] when I got up
[46:18] I got very weekend hours like hey good
[46:22] even this can happen
[46:31] I almost
[46:34] for sure at that point you can lose your
[46:37] faith
[46:45] yeah so that's what happened
[46:50] [Music]
[46:53] bites I I felt very weak and I wanted to
[46:56] tell personally
[47:04] identical question tell him that is
[47:12] before God makes a move
[47:15] that before God makes the movement
[47:19] also tries to make his move I went back
[47:23] to my seat I thought about it
[47:30] I was like oh my god oh come on
[47:34] then I started comparing the Heat
[47:40] the first hit it passed on me and I felt
[47:43] it was more
[47:45] um
[47:48] there was something comes like this
[47:52] so I
[47:55] I left it to God
[48:00] cartoon
[48:02] is that if I didn't receive it that day
[48:06] and they will try to impersonate it
[48:10] means mine is coming their money
[48:13] but I also believe I got it
[48:22] very different
[48:24] you don't see it by the way when I'm
[48:27] notifying none of your noise
[49:28] foreign foreign
[50:07] [Music]
[50:11] amen
[50:13] breakfast
[50:15] amen
[50:19] I'm sorry for you know it was
[50:22] unavoidable
[50:24] but I also believe with brother polka
[50:28] that something happened
[50:30] if you have ever sold the Holy Ghost
[50:33] that there was some time he comes to
[50:34] disapprove
[50:36] but I believe something might have
[50:38] happened
[50:39] amen
[50:40] brothership
[50:43] foreign
[50:49] you have just preached in one second it
[50:52] was a powerful one
[50:56] like I shouldn't say something
[51:01] amen I thank God for your presence
[51:08] for everyone's presence
[51:13] and then and I thank God who led my
[51:17] brother from a second
[51:21] he came at night but he is
[51:25] I've been trying to highlight my
[51:28] testimony
[51:32] it is much the repetitive
[51:36] I can't finish it without
[51:39] but
[51:41] I think I violated some importance
[51:49] you know throughout the year since
[51:52] Jan last year
[51:59] God has really been manifesting himself
[52:02] through my life
[52:05] first of all right it's okay I'm really
[52:08] grateful for brother Isaac
[52:12] where is he
[52:16] I was also surprised by his testimony
[52:22] and I can say that God can change
[52:27] and I've learned something
[52:31] that it's not good to judge
[52:40] who used to judge him
[52:44] I remember we gave him a name a nickname
[52:58] yeah
[52:59] we used to call him mojosi
[53:03] because he used to
[53:06] be involved most of his time in news
[53:13] politics and when it comes to the word
[53:15] of God is
[53:24] but I was so surprised I was I was
[53:28] blessed by his testimony
[53:35] and so far the time I've been with him
[53:38] so if I can say that
[53:40] he's no longer that much in politics
[53:47] I can testify that it is
[54:05] I think that name should stop
[54:08] anyway uh I want to say something on
[54:10] that name
[54:12] personal I didn't know
[54:14] but I think brother shame
[54:16] we share the name but we share but it
[54:19] got a different meaning so on my side I
[54:22] also want to clarify it it was not
[54:24] because of that
[54:26] but uh when past since it was uh his
[54:31] pastor's son to me I called him morozi I
[54:34] was calling him like the first design
[54:39] is the past son of the world but there
[54:42] is aspect why I made him like that why I
[54:45] called him but it was on that not only
[54:47] argumentative side okay
[54:49] yeah so I will talk about my school life
[54:52] um
[54:53] you know I've just completed High School
[54:57] um
[55:07] the full amount even before the times
[55:13] and at school I can say I was respected
[55:24] yeah
[55:27] so I thank God for that is
[55:37] yeah now um
[55:40] I will not feel ashamed to say this
[55:44] that in all my school life
[55:48] I didn't have any girlfriend yeah
[55:59] they could come and tell you they love
[56:02] you somewhere
[56:04] foreign
[56:10] but I thank God that I stood farm
[56:17] and I was able to witness to all my
[56:20] friends
[56:23] none of my friends
[56:28] and I tried my best to bring him to
[56:31] church somewhere
[56:40] foreign
[57:04] to make sure that I
[57:07] leader
[57:12] another thing I thank God
[57:15] this last year
[57:17] they never wanted me dead Satani yeah
[57:22] two times the first time
[57:27] you remember
[57:30] then the second death it was physical
[57:37] of course I will not go in details of
[57:39] the first day
[57:43] okay
[58:01] I think he was shocked also yeah
[58:15] so the second
[58:17] um
[58:23] and I just felt like I should walk
[58:31] I'm not used to work but
[58:36] that time I said
[58:39] and the reason why I was walking is
[58:43] I wanted to move when listening the
[58:46] message
[58:49] by the time you move from school up to
[58:52] here yeah
[58:59] so as I was listening that someone
[59:03] near you
[59:05] and I reached Northern
[59:09] bypass I think
[59:12] those bad guys the thugs they saw my
[59:15] phone
[59:18] like I moved my phone to check on the
[59:21] time but now this is
[59:24] really I can't tell what will happen but
[59:27] yes
[59:29] they pierced my hand with a sharp object
[59:33] they sang above nature into H4 meter and
[59:37] I was unconscious
[59:40] because there is
[59:47] literally and then because I was over
[59:50] bleeding I bleeded like three kilograms
[59:52] is
[1:00:03] foreign
[1:00:15] but you see the good thing it was the
[1:00:17] right motive why I decided to work

[1:00:27] and I believe there is a purpose

[1:18:38] mean nothing I can do but you you can
[1:18:41] you're the one who knows how to help him

[1:21:07] I'm here
[1:21:11] for his goodness
[1:21:17] God brought me
[1:21:20] when I remember where God brought him
[1:21:22] from
[1:21:24] I just said Thank You Lord
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:30] I was a sinner and so proud and this is
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:46] saying that
[1:21:48] who brought him that far he was such a
[1:21:51] young it was a young man with a lot of
[1:21:54] prayer he was so proud
[1:21:58] but one day
[1:22:00] the Lord visit me
[1:22:04] [Music]
[1:22:24] maybe it was going under the depression
[1:22:26] or some hard situation yes
[1:22:45] and I love that word so much
[1:22:52] and I believe God had prepared for me
[1:22:54] something else
[1:23:06] I was uh from Protestants
[1:23:18] I was a borderline believer when I got
[1:23:21] this side this side I just got fresh
[1:23:23] money when things and then I go back
[1:23:25] when things are okay I go back to my
[1:23:26] religion
[1:23:31] is
[1:23:36] but when it comes to baptism I was a
[1:23:38] little bit confused
[1:23:41] but one day God help me
[1:23:43] and I was born
[1:23:46] and I thank the Lord
[1:23:52] pray that God gives me courage
[1:23:59] foreign
[1:24:12] God bless you Saints
[1:24:16] start with this song it's called through
[1:24:19] the fire
[1:24:31] so many times I've questioned
[1:24:35] citing circumstances or things I could
[1:24:40] not under stand
[1:24:44] and many times in Trials
[1:24:47] weakness plus my vision and my
[1:24:51] frustration get so out of in
[1:24:56] each then that I'm reminded I've never
[1:25:01] been forsaken I've never had done a test
[1:25:07] alone
[1:25:09] as I look at all the victories the
[1:25:13] spirit rise is up in me and he's through
[1:25:17] the fire my weakness is made strong
[1:25:23] he never promised that the cross would
[1:25:27] not get heavy or that he will not be had
[1:25:33] to look alive
[1:25:37] he never offered her pictures without
[1:25:42] fighting bodies

[1:30:13] I think your own school is not easy
[1:30:18] I don't mean in terms of Education
[1:30:22] I mean in terms of keeping yourself in
[1:30:25] the world
[1:30:28] first time
[1:30:30] I was at my aunt
[1:30:32] foreign
[1:30:34] I could not
[1:30:39] Sunday we had lessons
[1:30:42] I could not make it both ways
[1:30:57] because even my aunt could not allow
[1:30:59] well
[1:31:02] she started making my situation hard
[1:31:07] as in like she was torturing me
[1:31:12] I could tell her but and this other
[1:31:15] daughter of yours is the one doing all
[1:31:17] you think I'm doing but you would say no
[1:31:19] it's you my daughter can't do search
[1:31:34] now I just kept quiet and left
[1:31:42] and my friends could stand for me and
[1:31:45] say really we run you have tried your
[1:31:47] best
[1:31:50] I could try to be friends with the other
[1:31:53] girl
[1:31:59] if she has a problem I'm the first first
[1:32:02] person she would run to we are foreign
[1:32:44] I'm new in the school
[1:32:46] I do not know the boy
[1:32:49] you already told him bad things about me
[1:32:54] so there's no way we can be friends
[1:32:59] how would you hate me because of him
[1:33:03] and she was like
[1:33:09] so I just left
[1:33:12] but one time it became too much
[1:33:16] she would say that I sleep with boys I
[1:33:20] do all that nasty stuff
[1:33:24] I thought so bad and I was like Jimmy
[1:33:27] really
[1:33:30] we stay in the same house we are like
[1:33:34] sisters
[1:33:40] from the same place
[1:33:43] we share everything
[1:33:46] and you're saying that about me
[1:33:51] I just felt tired I went I told my Aunt
[1:33:54] everything
[1:33:56] is
[1:33:57] so when aunt came to school to find out
[1:34:00] the truth
[1:34:02] she found even more that I also didn't
[1:34:05] know
[1:34:09] because the other guy was really
[1:34:12] something else
[1:34:22] for sure forgive me for saying this bad
[1:34:24] time
[1:34:29] she started making my life hell
[1:34:33] yeah
[1:34:36] [Music]
[1:34:38] at school you cannot make friends
[1:34:42] you try to make friends
[1:34:45] if she says you like let me say I'm with
[1:34:48] Rachel
[1:34:50] she will come should I tell you
[1:34:53] something
[1:34:54] that girl you're with um
[1:34:59] she's going to spoil you again and the
[1:35:03] whole school will hate you just leave it
[1:35:05] alone
[1:35:06] and that friend will disappear
[1:35:11] now when everyone found out the truth
[1:35:14] about Jamia
[1:35:18] they chased her from school
[1:35:23] I felt bad cause you were both in t7
[1:35:27] and I took as my sister I think
[1:35:31] so my dad just said I don't know also
[1:35:34] yeah I cannot leave you in that house
[1:35:35] I'm taking you
[1:35:37] back so I started living with my mother
[1:35:42] that period I was so happy to be with my
[1:35:45] mom
[1:35:46] because every Sunday she could try her
[1:35:50] level best that I am at church
[1:35:58] I would
[1:36:00] stream the services
[1:36:03] should try her level best
[1:36:08] some kind of problems still happened
[1:36:12] I believe it was the devil trying to do
[1:36:14] that yes
[1:36:15] so all was well cause my God was with me
[1:36:21] so I started living with my Heritage at
[1:36:24] school
[1:36:26] problems
[1:36:30] the boy I was first
[1:36:33] that I like him something like that
[1:36:37] um
[1:36:40] now we are living in the same house
[1:36:44] sleeping in the same room
[1:36:51] and they said they gave me at the dining
[1:36:54] table
