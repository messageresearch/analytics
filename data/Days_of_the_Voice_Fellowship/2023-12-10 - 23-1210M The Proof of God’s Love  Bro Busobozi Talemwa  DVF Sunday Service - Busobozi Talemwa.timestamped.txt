[1:26:43] word I wanted to let you know just give
[1:26:46] a few
[1:26:49] announcements first of all Brothers
[1:26:51] brother Marvin are you you
[1:26:52] ready can you please put that on the
[1:26:54] screen
[1:26:56] quickly we
[1:26:58] have initially we started H we we
[1:27:02] informed everybody that we are
[1:27:04] registering for the Youth meetings by
[1:27:06] making a
[1:27:15] payment and so um several people have
[1:27:19] already done the
[1:27:21] payment
[1:27:22] and when you made your payment we
[1:27:24] registered you
[1:27:28] automatically because then you can be
[1:27:30] able to capture your details from the
[1:27:32] payment you have
[1:27:35] made but I noticed that there are many
[1:27:38] many who were not able to make a payment
[1:27:41] up front and yet they would like to come
[1:27:43] to the
[1:27:49] meetings making the the payment fast was
[1:27:52] being a stumbling block for
[1:27:57] them and yet it is very important for us
[1:28:00] to know who is going to
[1:28:02] attend uh the the youth
[1:28:08] meetings before the
[1:28:11] debts the main reason
[1:28:14] is uh yeah you just keep that until I'm
[1:28:17] ready so the main reason
[1:28:20] is uh we are pending to each person that
[1:28:24] will come at the camp
[1:28:29] ground we are spending a minimum of
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:39] 120,000 that includes
[1:28:43] food it includes accommodation for three
[1:28:47] nights it includes you know payment of
[1:28:51] other things
[1:28:52] the H and other
[1:28:54] things and so when you add it all up a
[1:28:58] total sum depending on the amount of
[1:29:00] people that will
[1:29:04] come we are estimating a minimum of
[1:29:12] 20,000 and for accommodation
[1:29:16] alone anyone if you are planning to to
[1:29:19] sleep over at the
[1:29:20] meetings
[1:29:25] each night they will give you that
[1:29:26] mattress and the place to to
[1:29:29] [Music]
[1:29:31] sleep they will charge you 17,000
[1:29:36] ugand so those ones who know how to do
[1:29:39] math how much is that for three
[1:29:46] nights
[1:29:50] 51,000 so that's only for
[1:29:53] accommodation it's not paid to the
[1:29:55] church it's paid to the
[1:29:57] people that are going to give us the
[1:30:00] venue and so that's why we requested the
[1:30:05] members of the
[1:30:08] church each person to at least
[1:30:10] contribute
[1:30:14] 100,000 that means automatically you are
[1:30:17] going to spend the time the the night
[1:30:20] there and also you are going to uh
[1:30:24] contribute on the
[1:30:26] food and other things as well as even if
[1:30:30] you are not going to sleep over
[1:30:32] there that contribution will
[1:30:37] help I need to explain this
[1:30:39] properly because after the service I
[1:30:42] know brother Isaac will cut this and put
[1:30:44] it also on the
[1:30:49] group for the others to understand
[1:30:54] so H because of this
[1:30:58] amount that each person we are going to
[1:31:00] spend on
[1:31:01] them it means if the each person we have
[1:31:04] asked publicly for each person coming to
[1:31:07] the meetings to contribute
[1:31:15] 50,000 that means they are contributing
[1:31:17] a little bit on the
[1:31:20] meting we would want to know that they
[1:31:23] are coming so we can be able to estimate
[1:31:25] how much we we are looking for we are
[1:31:27] going to
[1:31:33] prepare so because of that we decided to
[1:31:38] put up an online
[1:31:42] form where anyone can register and it
[1:31:45] does not need you to make a payment for
[1:31:47] that very
[1:31:50] form
[1:31:53] and the form looks like this but this is
[1:31:55] a bit blurry can you make it more
[1:31:58] clear think online brother Isaac you can
[1:32:01] put it up for people to see um it looks
[1:32:05] can you go
[1:32:09] up does this have life brother
[1:32:16] Marvin is that a picture or it's a a a
[1:32:20] screen so can you go up on the top of
[1:32:24] the of of where this is beginning
[1:32:32] at yeah all right that that's enough so
[1:32:35] no so it begins like that it will give
[1:32:38] you the details of the
[1:32:41] meetings and and the first question will
[1:32:43] be your full

[1:33:20] church
[1:33:22] but down there then they will ask for
[1:33:25] your
[1:33:28] pastor now here you have to
[1:33:31] choose because I notice people we are
[1:33:32] writing things we were not even
[1:33:35] understanding so we put at least as much
[1:33:39] as many pastors names as we we could
[1:33:44] remember so just

[1:34:04] video as much as you told me you
[1:34:08] were yeah right there so you can see
[1:34:12] them and then you just select
[1:34:15] one okay and then uh do you need
[1:34:18] accommodation yes or no you select that
[1:34:22] have you paid your camp fee yes or no
[1:34:24] you that and then do you need uh to uh
[1:34:28] what is that
[1:34:30] assistance that is for some people who
[1:34:32] can't even afford the
[1:34:35] 50,000 we want them we want to know how
[1:34:38] much they can
[1:34:40] afford do you need to sponsor more young
[1:34:43] people if you want to sponsor somebody
[1:34:45] or if you want to pay the 50,000 now for
[1:34:47] the members of The church here if you
[1:34:48] want to pay 100,000 plus more for
[1:34:50] somebody else
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:55] and then uh what is the next question

[1:35:20] arrival so that form is very easy you
[1:35:23] fill it in less than five
[1:35:26] minutes and then you submit it and then
[1:35:29] get all those
[1:35:30] details we have uh quite a few uh a few
[1:35:36] registrations I think I don't think
[1:35:38] they've gotten to 100
[1:35:40] yet so that and many members of the
[1:35:42] church have not
[1:35:45] registered so that's why I thought I
[1:35:47] should let you know of
[1:35:49] that please get to make that
[1:35:51] registration
[1:35:54] if you don't have a
[1:35:56] smartphone someone with a smartphone can
[1:35:58] help
[1:36:00] you and they can you as an individual
[1:36:03] can register more than one
[1:36:08] people praise
[1:36:09] God also I wanted to let you know that
[1:36:12] uh
[1:36:20] yesterday
[1:36:22] the of
[1:36:27] November and
[1:36:29] uh we are used to paying six
[1:36:33] months or
[1:36:36] more uh but we have not yet received any
[1:36:39] rental
[1:36:43] contributions and so yesterday I made a
[1:36:45] payment of 1.6
[1:36:49] million for two months up to end of
[1:36:53] Fe believing that you will contribute it
[1:36:56] and more for more
[1:37:03] months just I wanted to let that need to
[1:37:05] be
[1:37:07] known
[1:37:10] also how many felt that sound was a bit
[1:37:12] better
[1:37:17] today uh can can you give me a little
[1:37:20] more sound
[1:37:23] how many felt that music sound was a bit
[1:37:25] better today those ones who have musical
[1:37:27] ears I'm talking about those ones who
[1:37:29] have
[1:37:32] mus I'm talking have musal
[1:37:35] ears
[1:37:40] so
[1:37:41] um we we were advised by the musical
[1:37:47] team we had only one best
[1:37:50] speaker
[1:37:52] and it was dying
[1:37:55] slowly because there were supposed to be
[1:37:57] two so I took it up myself and ordered
[1:38:00] another best
[1:38:04] speaker and I paid an amount of 400,000
[1:38:10] shs it has a balance on
[1:38:13] it of of
[1:38:16] 300,000 which I want to get

[1:38:28] that one person wants to give all the
[1:38:32] remainder then you will carry all the
[1:38:34] blessings for

[1:48:05] love there's this verse
[1:48:08] here I will tell you when the sound is
[1:48:11] fine uh there's this verse here
[1:48:14] according as he has chosen Us in
[1:48:17] him before the foundation of the world
[1:48:22] that we would be holy and Without Blame
[1:48:24] before him in
[1:48:29] love that having
[1:48:32] predestinated
[1:48:35] us now before that let me read this
[1:48:38] verse again according as he has chosen
[1:48:41] Us in him before the foundation of the
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:49] world he did
[1:48:53] what he chose
[1:48:55] us
[1:48:58] where in
[1:49:00] him before
[1:49:02] when before the foundation of the
[1:49:07] world so God did not choose me when I
[1:49:12] believed he chose me from before the
[1:49:14] foundation of the
[1:49:17] world many Pentecostals pray pray like
[1:49:22] this oh God now that this person has
[1:49:26] believed remove his
[1:49:28] name from The Book of death and write it
[1:49:33] in the Book of
[1:49:35] Life don't ever pray such
[1:49:38] prayers don't even ever say Amen to such
[1:49:41] [Music]
[1:49:43] prayers I can see you are not
[1:49:46] understanding what I'm talking
[1:49:48] about God does not is not ring is not
[1:49:51] running to and
[1:49:54] fro that because people are getting
[1:49:57] saved God has a big
[1:50:00] pain and everybody that get saved an
[1:50:04] angel comes and
[1:50:05] announ so and so
[1:50:07] he okay give me
[1:50:10] the first of all a big
[1:50:13] duster big rubber he
[1:50:17] RS and then he goes with a big pen
[1:50:21] he writes
[1:50:22] it and then he says Ah even
[1:50:25] SC where is
[1:50:28] my he
[1:50:30] it where is my
[1:50:33] he that is a
[1:50:35] lie God is Not Like a
[1:50:38] Man we understand like
[1:50:41] men God is
[1:50:43] God and God knew the end from the very
[1:50:47] beginning God did not Choose You when
[1:50:50] you
[1:50:52] believed God chose you before you were
[1:50:55] born God chose you before you were in
[1:50:58] your mother's room what chose you before
[1:51:02] even the world was
[1:51:05] formed God God chose you before Genesis
[1:51:11] 1:1 where were you were in
[1:51:15] him when before the foundation of the
[1:51:18] world
[1:51:21] before even God became
[1:51:23] God you
[1:51:25] were before there was anything to
[1:51:28] worship you were in him so when did he
[1:51:32] choose you again now with that
[1:51:35] understanding let us read the scripture
[1:51:39] according as he has chosen Us in
[1:51:43] him
[1:51:46] before the foundation of the
[1:51:48] world
[1:51:51] before the foundation of the
[1:51:54] world that that we should be
[1:52:00] holy and Without
[1:52:03] Blame before him in
[1:52:06] love now when he shows you oh my this is
[1:52:11] going to excite some of
[1:52:14] you when God chose
[1:52:16] you he chose a blameless person
[1:52:22] he chose a holy
[1:52:25] person because in God there is no
[1:52:29] blame in God there is no sin so if I was
[1:52:33] in
[1:52:34] him he does not see a
[1:52:37] sinner he does not see a bad woman a bad
[1:52:40] man so he saw a perfect
[1:52:45] person he's coming to Rapture a perfect
[1:52:48] Church
[1:52:51] not the church that is here
[1:52:52] today but the church that he chose
[1:52:55] before the foundation of the
[1:52:58] world and now when you see the
[1:53:02] imperfections it only shows you a
[1:53:05] fact that Perfection must
[1:53:10] come praise God praise God let us also
[1:53:15] read Romans
[1:53:18] 8 these are very very interesting
[1:53:23] facts vers
[1:53:25] 28 and we know that all things work
[1:53:30] together for
[1:53:32] good to them that love
[1:53:35] God you know here he says that that that
[1:53:40] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:53:43] before him in
[1:53:47] love this is a love story
[1:53:50] [Music]
[1:53:52] God chose you because he loved
[1:53:55] you and you need to
[1:53:58] understand
[1:53:59] love I talked about love
[1:54:02] here if you missed someone please go and
[1:54:05] listen to
[1:54:06] me two times I spoke
[1:54:12] on but here I'm speaking of agap
[1:54:16] love agap love is perfect
[1:54:21] love is not moved by actions or by
[1:54:26] feelings that kind of love is
[1:54:30] unconditional and that kind of love you
[1:54:32] do not do anything to attract
[1:54:37] it you are simply
[1:54:40] loved and then you are
[1:54:42] chosen are you following me now so now
[1:54:46] we know that all things work together
[1:54:48] for good
[1:54:51] to them that love
[1:54:53] God not them that love God with
[1:54:59] f but that love
[1:55:05] with if you love God no matter what
[1:55:09] happens no matter what goes around no
[1:55:12] matter what doesn't
[1:55:14] happen you are not
[1:55:16] moved because you know you sing that
[1:55:18] song I shall not
[1:55:21] moved I shall be like a tree planted By
[1:55:24] the
[1:55:25] Waters because Jesus is my savior I
[1:55:29] shall not be moved so now you are
[1:55:32] planted in Christ and you will say what
[1:55:37] can separate
[1:55:39] me from the love of
[1:55:42] God is it lack is it you know
[1:55:47] pestilence is it suffering is it death
[1:55:51] nothing shall separate
[1:55:53] me because you have the love that God
[1:55:56] has for
[1:55:59] you your love for God is Not
[1:56:04] conditional how many have prayed such
[1:56:08] prayers if you do this for me I swear I
[1:56:13] will love you
[1:56:15] forever then you don't truly love
[1:56:18] you your love is
[1:56:21] conditional but you're supposed to love
[1:56:24] God whether he commits you to
[1:56:27] death whether he commits you to life or
[1:56:31] to suffering or to good things or to Joy
[1:56:35] or to sadness your love should not be
[1:56:41] moved so he says all things work
[1:56:45] together for good to them that love
[1:56:47] God to them who are
[1:56:51] called according to his
[1:56:55] purpose in
[1:56:57] Ephesians the verse n there are many
[1:57:01] many things I I really want you to get
[1:57:03] today so I want you to follow me
[1:57:06] closely he said having made known unto
[1:57:12] us the mystery of his
[1:57:17] will Accord to
[1:57:20] what to his good
[1:57:24] pleasure which he has already purposed
[1:57:28] in
[1:57:31] himself he has already purposed
[1:57:34] something in
[1:57:36] himself let me tell you if you talk to
[1:57:39] someone that claim to be your
[1:57:42] friend and they they tell you if you do
[1:57:45] this for me I will do
[1:57:46] this but in their hearts they have
[1:57:49] already purposed not to do what they
[1:57:54] saying nothing will move them because it
[1:57:57] is a purpose within
[1:58:01] them now God when he chose
[1:58:05] us he chose us according to the mystery
[1:58:09] of his
[1:58:12] will God has a will for
[1:58:16] you but that
[1:58:18] will always
[1:58:20] known it is
[1:58:23] mysterious it you have to seek after it
[1:58:27] you have to know it it has to be
[1:58:29] revealed to you but
[1:58:32] God before the foundation of the
[1:58:35] world according to his good
[1:58:41] pleasure he has already purpose in
[1:58:46] himself so God has already purposed what
[1:58:50] he's going to do with
[1:58:52] me it is not a new thing there is
[1:58:56] nothing I'm going to
[1:58:57] do nothing I will not do will change the
[1:59:02] purpose of God for
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:04] me God has already purposed
[1:59:07] this and when God gives his
[1:59:11] word he gives it on the basis of his
[1:59:18] purpose
[1:59:21] so now here in Romans he continues on to
[1:59:23] say all things work together for
[1:59:26] good to them that love
[1:59:29] God to them who who are the
[1:59:35] called
[1:59:36] according to his
[1:59:40] purpose so that when God knew
[1:59:42] you God chose you God predestinated
[1:59:47] you I'm going to come to those things
[1:59:51] and God had a
[1:59:52] purpose when he when when he chose
[1:59:55] you he had a purpose for you and that
[2:00:00] purpose made him to call
[2:00:05] you I am the
[2:00:07] called according to his
[2:00:10] purpose I am here to accomplish a
[2:00:13] purpose he did not say according to the
[2:00:15] to all the
[2:00:18] cold to I don't know how to
[2:00:21] say he's not saying according to
[2:00:24] everyone but according to
[2:00:30] the I am the C
[2:00:33] brother tell someone I'm
[2:00:37] the I am the I am here to accomplish a
[2:00:42] purpose not demon no Spirit no power no
[2:00:47] Wicked forces of sat
[2:00:49] that
[2:00:50] purpose I am here to accomplish that
[2:00:54] purpose I am here to fulfill the desire
[2:00:57] of God I am here to live according to
[2:01:01] the pleasure of his own good
[2:01:05] will I am here because he loved me and
[2:01:09] because he loved me he chose me in
[2:01:12] him the foundation of the
[2:01:15] world God knew I would be here knew you
[2:01:19] would be here there is nothing happening
[2:01:22] by
[2:01:23] mistake he had it all in his
[2:01:26] mind knew it because he's
[2:01:30] God God doesn't plant things like
[2:01:34] man God does everything according to his
[2:01:40] purpose follow me closely here ver9 for
[2:01:45] whom he did
[2:01:48] for
[2:01:49] he also did
[2:01:53] predestinate to be
[2:01:56] confirmed to the
[2:01:58] image of his
[2:02:01] son if God chose you in
[2:02:04] him then he for knew
[2:02:08] you and if he for knew you what did he
[2:02:12] do he
[2:02:15] predestinated understand the word
[2:02:17] predestinate
[2:02:19] pre is
[2:02:22] before
[2:02:24] destinate is the
[2:02:29] destination now God knew the
[2:02:33] destination at the
[2:02:35] beginning so because he for knew you he
[2:02:39] predestinated
[2:02:41] you to be what to be
[2:02:44] conformed to the image of his
[2:02:47] son that means god already

[2:03:45] knew he also did predestinate
[2:03:52] Beed oh my good Lord amen God saw the
[2:03:56] end at the
[2:03:58] beginning if he knew you he saw you
[2:04:02] here and then he saw you
[2:04:06] there what we are struggling with is
[2:04:09] between this and
[2:04:11] that but God is saying don't want a
[2:04:15] daughter don't a son I've seen your hand
[2:04:20] I know how it will
[2:04:22] end it must end according to my
[2:04:28] purpose amen hallelujah

[2:05:16] them he justified them

[2:05:27] place when you say God I did this I did
[2:05:30] that he will say when did you do it
[2:05:33] don't remember when I was 15 years old
[2:05:37] he says I don't remember why because you
[2:05:41] are

[2:05:50] clean how by his
[2:05:55] justification by his death on the

[2:06:58] are walking in Heavenly
[2:07:02] places we are not normal human
[2:07:06] being we are not normal human
[2:07:09] beings there are some people who are not
[2:07:11] normal human
[2:07:12] beings one of them was
[2:07:15] Moses to the extent Moses mared out of
[2:07:18] the
[2:07:21] word and when God came down to
[2:07:25] Moses he said nothing about
[2:07:29] it
[2:07:30] nothing it was breaking the word as at
[2:07:34] the as they knew
[2:07:37] it but God said nothing
[2:07:39] about but his
[2:07:41] sister and his brother Aon and his
[2:07:46] sister and the
[2:07:50] minister they all against him how could
[2:07:53] Moses
[2:07:55] sin
[2:07:57] how but they did not understand that
[2:08:00] Moses was no longer
[2:08:02] Moses God had taken Moses to another
[2:08:07] position God had spoken to Moses and he
[2:08:09] had said to
[2:08:10] him I'll make you
[2:08:14] God so the law was the
[2:08:17] law
[2:08:19] [Music]
[2:08:21] in Hues was at another
[2:08:25] level he was was he was no longer under
[2:08:28] the
[2:08:29] law there is something I
[2:08:32] to he was no longer under the
[2:08:34] law he was above the law he was the law
[2:08:40] himself and when they when they accused
[2:08:43] him of
[2:08:44] sin God was
[2:08:46] silent he was wondering what are they
[2:08:48] talking
[2:08:49] about no he
[2:08:51] Sean
[2:08:54] woman God said nothing I don't see
[2:08:57] anything he
[2:08:58] has he no longer of your
[2:09:03] type is above
[2:09:05] you and when
[2:09:11] they God rebuked all of
[2:09:13] them that he even cast them they became
[2:09:17] leapers
[2:09:20] even his
[2:09:21] sister mes was the one who had to
[2:09:23] intered
[2:09:25] for imagine that kind of
[2:09:29] power now God is saying to them that he
[2:09:33] justifi he has removed them from the of
[2:09:37] the
[2:09:38] Comm and he has glorified
[2:09:43] them there are people on Earth
[2:09:45] here who are glorified
[2:09:50] hallelujah how are they
[2:09:52] glorified they are no longer
[2:09:55] commoners because he says in his word
[2:09:58] you are
[2:10:00] Kings he also says you are
[2:10:03] priests you need to
[2:10:05] understand
[2:10:07] this should call Lage or this level of
[2:10:10] Kings and
[2:10:12] Priests was the most sac in all
[2:10:17] Israel kings were special
[2:10:19] men priest were special men but you are
[2:10:23] both of
[2:10:25] them but remember Jesus was the first
[2:10:29] born of this
[2:10:32] order of kings and priest because he's
[2:10:35] the king of kings and he the high priest
[2:10:39] of our
[2:10:40] confession so then he says but
[2:10:43] you you are Kings and
[2:10:47] Priests you are a royal
[2:10:51] priesthood you are a
[2:10:53] pecul god do you understand what I'm

[2:13:09] woman Tes
[2:13:12] Revelation understand who you
[2:13:15] are praise God
[2:13:18] you need to
[2:13:20] understand we are a people that are not
[2:13:23] common
[2:13:27] us praise
[2:13:29] God Peter comes to
[2:13:32] Jesus and he says
[2:13:34] Jesus there is no
[2:13:36] money Jesus was like they can't
[2:13:38] understand what I've
[2:13:42] made understand he says Peter what are
[2:13:46] you doing I'm a fisherman
[2:13:49] okay okay I made you a fish of
[2:13:53] men but while you fishing men through
[2:13:56] that
[2:13:57] fishing you going to do a special
[2:14:01] fishing Peter fished all his
[2:14:05] life but he has never he had never
[2:14:07] fished
[2:14:09] money so now you're going to fish
[2:14:11] money so you can know when I make you a
[2:14:15] fish
[2:14:16] of means
[2:14:21] is told him Peter go and
[2:14:25] fish his fishing was
[2:14:28] different others were fishing but also
[2:14:31] Peter fish his fishing was different and
[2:14:35] when he fished he fished
[2:14:37] money he fished a fish which had money

[2:14:49] also had Bank of
[2:14:52] Uganda it even had a
[2:14:55] number Jesus is not a
[2:15:00] scammer so how did that did it bypass
[2:15:05] everything God created it
[2:15:07] there in his own way what I'm saying is

[2:15:13] be and you find yourself a

[2:15:29] businessman a business woman in a
[2:15:30] different way your money will come

[2:15:39] Beyond what your business can give

[2:15:54] people in this world are not living at
[2:15:57] the masses of
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:15:59] governments they are not living at the
[2:16:01] masses of
[2:16:02] families Liv the mes of
[2:16:07] societies Church Hallelujah there are
[2:16:11] people that we call it living by a
[2:16:14] miracle it is not a miracle more than a
[2:16:18] miracle is more than a miracle if you
[2:16:21] don't know those people one of them and
[2:16:25] I tell you you can also be one
[2:16:27] of that even all the businesses you ear
[2:16:30] put together you put together it cannot
[2:16:33] make you what you
[2:16:35] are feed you what you eat because the
[2:16:38] food you eat is more than what man
[2:16:41] gives man shall not live by bread
[2:16:45] alone have a secr kind of
[2:16:49] food because we are different people am
[2:16:52] I talking in Tong don't you see what I'm
[2:16:56] saying God has glorified you you don't
[2:16:59] live at the mes of
[2:17:01] men you don't go begging he don't go
[2:17:05] asking he don't go pulling God is able
[2:17:09] to from
[2:17:11] n this is the God we
[2:17:14] ser and when he gives you a vision
[2:17:18] start this start start a company God has
[2:17:21] already given you
[2:17:23] Capital that capital is not
[2:17:26] money that is in
[2:17:28] you God has already placed everything
[2:17:31] you need in
[2:17:32] you Peter
[2:17:36] needed was to go and fish Peter had
[2:17:40] everything he
[2:17:42] needed the knowledge was in him the
[2:17:45] ideas was in him how to fish brother if
[2:17:49] I give you a
[2:17:52] fishing can you
[2:17:54] fish when I was in Zimbabwe I learned
[2:17:58] how to
[2:17:59] fish and my first time fishing I fished
[2:18:02] two
[2:18:04] fish and I was excited when I came to
[2:18:07] Uganda I bought fishing
[2:18:14] rods I started going to Victoria every
[2:18:17] fish
[2:18:19] and when I went there the first
[2:18:20] day I fish the first
[2:18:23] fish and it came out and it went away
[2:18:26] with my
[2:18:29] hook and I saw it but it just went with
[2:18:32] my
[2:18:34] hook and I've never fished another
[2:18:38] fish that means I'm not an experienced
[2:18:42] fisherman but Peter was
[2:18:44] experienced when God comes to you to you
[2:18:47] in what you
[2:18:49] know so don't think that Peter had what
[2:18:53] it took to get what he
[2:18:58] needed it was in him but he did not know
[2:19:02] it is in you but you don't know what God
[2:19:06] has given you oh my God oh my God
[2:19:09] hallelujah amen this Revelation is
[2:19:12] burning out me if you pray for me God
[2:19:15] will bring it
[2:19:16] out
[2:19:18] and he says here in verse
[2:19:19] three Ephesians 1 blessed be the god of

[2:33:39] knew because he's
[2:33:43] God he predestinate he he is not
[2:33:48] willing that any should
[2:33:50] perish for by but by his for
[2:33:56] knowledge he knew who would accept
[2:34:00] it and who would
[2:34:03] not therefore he can make
[2:34:08] everything work according to his big
[2:34:11] time clock that is taking
[2:34:15] away
[2:34:20] Hallelujah that's why he got to that man
[2:34:23] called what was his name
[2:34:26] Judas he knew because he was God are you
[2:34:31] hearing me he told him one of you is
[2:34:35] going to betray me he didn't
[2:34:38] desire but he knew
[2:34:44] it he said one I'm giving
[2:34:48] [Music]
[2:34:50] sir said not me he said Judas what you
[2:34:54] have to do do
[2:34:57] quickly why because
[2:35:00] Judas
[2:35:02] knew what he wanted to
[2:35:05] do but before Judas did
[2:35:11] not praise God before Jesus gave Judas
[2:35:18] [Music]
[2:35:19] that Judas did not
[2:35:22] know that he was going to
[2:35:26] be but when he said one of you is going
[2:35:29] to betray
[2:35:31] me said who not
[2:35:34] me said not
[2:35:39] me Judas what you have to do do
[2:35:44] quickly because now Jesus knew that
[2:35:47] Judas has now
[2:35:51] known and Judas walked away from
[2:35:54] there and betrayed
[2:35:57] him I believe even at the last
[2:36:00] minute Judas thought he was playing a
[2:36:05] game so he can get money out of
[2:36:07] it but Jesus already
[2:36:10] knew how he was going to
[2:36:12] end he had to kill himself
[2:36:17] but for
[2:36:19] you God also
[2:36:21] knows your
[2:36:24] end and that's why he has brought the
[2:36:27] word to tell you don't worry about what
[2:36:30] you're
[2:36:36] going so because is God he for the end
[2:36:40] from the
[2:36:43] beginning that's why when a preacher
[2:36:45] comes
[2:36:47] preaching by under
[2:36:49] inspiration God can give him a word of
[2:36:55] knowledge will speak to you
[2:36:58] directly word of
[2:37:03] what God is the one who knows your
[2:37:07] life so the word of
[2:37:09] Knowledge from
[2:37:12] God
[2:37:14] you and then you'll be say how good the
[2:37:17] man was speaking about my life not a man
[2:37:21] it is God who was telling you about your
[2:37:24] life therefore when it comes to you
[2:37:28] don't just be
[2:37:30] surprised then people begin maybe
[2:37:32] someone told
[2:37:34] him oh people
[2:37:38] unbelievers when God speaks and the word
[2:37:42] Des
[2:37:44] you just
[2:37:46] that say Amen to that receive the
[2:37:50] promise of that and God will do
[2:37:53] something for you if you're fighting
[2:37:55] something and the preure talks about it
[2:37:58] it means God has brought Deliverance to
[2:38:02] you God would come in the meeting of

[2:38:09] call people

[2:38:26] it is God and this word
[2:38:29] itself is a
[2:38:31] designer of the thoughts and int
[2:38:35] of don't say God cannot do it for
[2:38:39] you when he has come to do it for
[2:38:44] you

[2:47:03] Hallelujah I want to finish with this
[2:47:07] quot in the
[2:47:10] message Church
[2:47:13] h
[2:47:15] now the Lord God Almighty
[2:47:18] says I
[2:47:20] know there he is walking in the midst of
[2:47:22] his
[2:47:24] people there he is the chief Shepherd of
[2:47:27] the
[2:47:28] flock but does he hold back the
[2:47:35] persecution does he stem the
[2:47:38] tribulation no he does not he simply
[2:47:43] says I know your
[2:47:48] tribulation I
[2:47:49] know I know what you're going
[2:48:01] through I am not at all unmindful of
[2:48:04] your
[2:48:07] suffer if God loves me why did you this
[2:48:10] happen to me why does he let this bad
[2:48:12] feelings come in my body and I
[2:48:16] feel why why why if God loves me why
[2:48:20] take it away I know I
[2:48:25] knower I know why am I poor m is
[2:48:30] difficult don't even
[2:48:32] have I
[2:48:34] know why is my family in
[2:48:37] problems my
[2:48:43] husband I am not at all
[2:48:48] mindful I'm not un mindful of your
[2:48:52] suffering and he says what a stumbling
[2:48:54] block this is to so many
[2:48:59] people like Israel they wonder if God
[2:49:01] really loves
[2:49:04] them how can God just be so loving and
[2:49:07] if he stands by and watch
[2:49:13] people what they
[2:49:16] asked in Mal
[2:49:18] 1 1
[2:49:20] to says the burden of the word of the
[2:49:24] Lord to Israel by
[2:49:28] Mal I have loved
[2:49:36] you
[2:49:39] us was not es Jacob's
[2:49:43] brother
[2:49:45] say the Lord yet I
[2:49:48] love and I
[2:49:51] hat and laid his mountains and his
[2:49:54] Heritage W for the dragons of the
[2:50:00] Wilderness I it
[2:50:03] West for the his Heritage was made
[2:50:09] West for the dragons of the
[2:50:12] Wilderness because he didn't love him
[2:50:15] but he loved you your heritage will not
[2:50:18] be made
[2:50:21] W
[2:50:23] no you see they could not figure out
[2:50:26] God's
[2:50:29] love thought that love meant no
[2:50:35] suffering they thought that love meant a
[2:50:37] baby with a parental
[2:50:42] care God
[2:50:45] that his
[2:50:46] love was elective
[2:50:52] love the proof of his
[2:50:55] love
[2:51:03] is that no matter what
[2:51:06] happened no matter what happens in your
[2:51:09] life his love was proven truly by the
[2:51:14] fact that we were chosen unto
[2:51:22] salvation Hallelujah because God has
[2:51:25] chosen
[2:51:27] you me to
[2:51:29] Salvation through sanctification of the
[2:51:32] spirit and belief of the
[2:51:37] truth he may commit you to death as he
[2:51:40] did
[2:51:42] Paul he may commit you suffering as he
[2:51:45] did
[2:51:48] job that is his
[2:51:52] prerogative his own good
[2:51:56] pleasure he is
[2:52:00] Sovereign but it is all with a
[2:52:04] purpose if he did not have a
[2:52:07] purpose then he would be the author of
[2:52:09] frustration and not of
[2:52:13] peace work together for
[2:52:17] good to them that love
[2:52:20] God and according to his
[2:52:26] purpose there is a purpose to everything
[2:52:28] that is happening in
[2:52:31] life quit questioning
[2:52:34] God Ming and crying
[2:52:38] sh stop that
[2:52:41] Church begin thanking God and moving on
