[56:22] can be able to put those scriptures
[56:24] together
[56:25] two different windows
[56:32] and the lord god caused a deep sleep to
[56:34] fall on adam and he slept and he took
[56:36] one of his ribs and closed
[56:38] up up the flesh instead they wrote
[56:56] and out of that sleep
[56:58] god took out a rib out of his skull
[57:03] he made a woman
[57:06] are you following me
[57:08] and here the lord comes from the
[57:10] resurrection

[58:43] and the lord god calls the deep sleep
[58:45] and then after that he says he took one
[58:48] of his ribs and closed up the flesh
[58:50] instead they're wrong
[58:54] [Music]

[1:00:12] foundation here for cattle that we are

[1:00:22] through my mind right now i pray that
[1:00:23] you will open your mind to receive it
[1:00:39] stories in the bible
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:00:51] is
[1:01:08] m so in genesis 1
[1:01:12] god coming down
[1:01:14] and he creates man
[1:01:17] by the spoken word
[1:01:20] so where was man before he was created
[1:01:36] you could not see him physically
[1:01:38] because he was in the image of god
[1:01:40] commanded him
[1:01:41] god is a spirit
[1:01:43] on the moon
[1:01:44] was the spirit guard
[1:01:46] he told them never come back go and
[1:01:49] murder
[1:02:32] amen
[1:02:33] he came down
[1:02:35] and he breathed nassar on the nose on
[1:02:38] the nostrils of his mouth yes
[1:02:45] my mind immediately was running to john
[1:02:47] chapter 20.
[1:02:50] yes
[1:02:52] verse 19.
[1:02:54] he says he says peace be still
[1:02:57] peace be unto you
[1:03:00] and then he says save you the holy ghost
[1:03:04] all right all right
[1:03:05] let's take it a little slow here
[1:03:09] then he says
[1:03:10] then jesus said unto them again yes
[1:03:14] after he had showed them
[1:03:20] [Music]
[1:03:28] then jesus said to them again yes
[1:03:31] peace be unto you
[1:03:33] as my father sent me next time
[1:03:36] even so send are you manga remember and
[1:03:38] then when he had said this
[1:03:41] when he had saved me so
[1:03:56] wasn't something they were going to
[1:03:58] struggle for the challenge
[1:04:02] it was a must for them to receive the
[1:04:04] holy ghost
[1:04:07] and this is what i want to learn
[1:04:39] you're still following me
[1:04:41] all right now
[1:04:43] we notice
[1:04:49] that
[1:04:50] jesus yes
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:21] in genesis chapter 2
[1:05:27] he says to this man he had molded out of
[1:05:30] the dust of the creature
[1:05:35] he actually says to that man the same
[1:05:38] thing jesus said to me when he rose from
[1:05:40] the crowd
[1:05:44] yesterday
[1:05:50] want you to understand here
[1:05:53] that by the time jesus
[1:05:55] breathed his breath
[1:06:13] jesus
[1:06:14] yes would not breathe on the people
[1:06:30] resurrection
[1:06:34] they could not receive it
[1:06:38] the ad can only be received
[1:06:42] when he when it is before the fall
[1:06:48] in other words
[1:06:50] you can only be in that image explaining
[1:06:52] it to yourself achieving them before the
[1:06:54] fall
[1:06:56] you can only be in the image of god
[1:07:12] who shall deliver
[1:07:21] [Applause]
[1:07:40] yesterday
[1:07:44] [Music]
[1:07:54] oh
[1:08:02] that has not maybe manifested in you in
[1:08:04] a greater way
[1:08:08] you find the thief they are beating oh
[1:08:10] sorry
[1:08:13] you are born that way now i shall reward
[1:08:15] you
[1:08:16] we were the fifth on the cross
[1:08:18] [Music]
[1:08:21] all of us were saved
[1:08:35] because of the way we were born
[1:08:49] you have to work on this
[1:08:54] i wanted to look at genesis 2 once again
[1:09:12] of the lord
[1:09:19] and the lord
[1:09:21] and the rib which the lord god
[1:09:23] had taken from the man
[1:09:26] made he a woman
[1:09:28] and brought her unto the man original
[1:09:32] gamba mukamaka
[1:10:01] their body was compromised
[1:10:05] and their blood was compromised
[1:10:08] they needed a correction
[1:10:14] they needed a correction some they
[1:10:16] needed to have a correction
[1:10:20] and the only way that there could be a
[1:10:22] correction
[1:10:24] it was for a sinless man
[1:10:32] hallelujah
[1:10:57] you and i probably several times that
[1:10:58] the reason why jesus came was to die on
[1:11:00] the cross
[1:11:04] and the reason why he died was because
[1:11:06] he wanted to redeem it
[1:11:10] and
[1:11:25] only there are some souls in this world
[1:11:28] that are not redeemable
[1:11:33] because they do not have the seed of god
[1:11:37] no matter what you do they can never
[1:12:44] and that means his children also were in
[1:12:46] his image meaning in the image of god
[1:13:30] a child of god
[1:14:25] is
[1:15:55] um i always speak for an hour i hope
[1:15:57] that that would be to about 12.
[1:15:59] so by one i'll be done
[1:16:01] hallelujah i mean
[1:16:03] so i wanted to follow me with all your
[1:16:05] chickens
[1:16:07] and so adam adam
[1:16:09] was then
[1:16:10] his nature was perverted
[1:16:14] and all his children
[1:16:17] were perverted by chiama
[1:17:42] oh
[1:18:52] does not
[1:19:19] redemption of your soul oh more enemies
[1:19:23] if you are truly redeemed
[1:19:26] must follow your life
[1:19:32] hallelujah amen and we see here
[1:19:48] from
[1:19:48] grace jesus and jesus yes would not
[1:19:51] breathe on them
[1:19:56] before they are redeemed

[1:20:02] they had done their works
