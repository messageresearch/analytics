[49:07] of us
[49:10] today
[49:12] amen so uh I bring you
[49:16] greetings from uh our friends brother
[49:19] Amos from
[49:21] Nairobi you ask me to the
[49:24] church
[49:26] uh sister Dina one of us here from
[49:29] Boston she's in um in
[49:34] Boston she has told me several times
[49:36] greet the church and I keep
[49:38] [Music]
[49:41] forgetting praise
[49:43] God and uh also I spoke to Pastor morus
[49:47] from
[49:50] Ethiopia he also sent his
[49:52] greetings and uh uh there are many
[49:56] people who are warming up to come for
[49:57] the Youth
[50:00] meetings are you warming up for our
[50:02] youth
[50:03] meetings we believe we are going to have
[50:05] a wonderful
[50:07] time there's a brother who contacted me
[50:10] uh I think a week
[50:13] ago he told me uh pastors as far as all
[50:17] vegetables is
[50:18] [Music]
[50:21] concerned it's on
[50:24] me
[50:26] he said he said I'm a
[50:28] farmer and uh I I I grow cabbages I grow
[50:33] greens and you know so he said I'm going
[50:36] to uh sponsor the the meetings for you
[50:40] all those
[50:44] things that one is already off our
[50:48] budget so our budget is still huge so if
[50:51] you want to remove something
[50:54] please
[50:56] and and I know that we are asking
[50:58] everyone to
[51:01] contribute the members here we are
[51:03] asking you to contribute
[51:07] 100,000 um and we appreciate there
[51:09] several who have already done their
[51:14] contributions and I want to appreciate
[51:16] you so much for
[51:18] that um so we are asking the others to
[51:22] contribute at at least
[51:24] 50,000
[51:27] and this amount really especially those
[51:29] who are going to be spending at the
[51:34] venue
[51:36] uh for a night they're asking us to pay
[51:39] 17,000
[51:44] person so if you if someone is spending
[51:48] there all the three
[51:51] nights that means that they will be
[51:53] spending 51,000
[51:58] so that means that even the 50,000 we
[52:01] asking them to pay will not be enough
[52:03] for just
[52:08] accommodation and um then of course we
[52:10] have the
[52:12] food uh and and as well as the venue the
[52:17] me venue that we will need to pay for as
[52:21] well so we estimated a minimum amount of
[52:32] 12,000 so that means if someone
[52:34] contributes
[52:37] 50,000 um they have contributed
[52:41] something so where does the rest of the
[52:44] burden
[52:45] go of how
[52:50] much that's a minimum we saying a
[52:53] minimum because it will depend on
[52:54] several things
[52:59] depending on the number of the people
[53:01] that will
[53:02] turn 120 to 140 per person because the
[53:06] food increases in
[53:10] price so depending on the people that
[53:13] will
[53:14] come it will either increase or reduce
[53:17] our
[53:20] cost per
[53:22] person that means the amount of 7 ,000
[53:27] shs that burden is going on us the
[53:30] [Music]
[53:33] hosts and uh uh there's a there's a
[53:38] there's a
[53:40] brother that sent me 3.5 million
[53:45] Shillings in contribution to the youth
[53:50] meetings and also there is a
[53:54] sister me 2.1 million
[53:58] shs towards the support of the youth
[54:01] me and all these individuals who were
[54:04] part of our
[54:06] assembly and they really moved towards
[54:10] the vision that the Lord has given to
[54:14] us and so uh the next person that will
[54:18] contribute that much can be
[54:22] you so as much as we asking you to give
[54:24] one
[54:27] 100,000 if God gives you a
[54:30] miracle please don't hesitate to
[54:32] contribute a substantive
[54:36] amount it will go a long way in
[54:38] supporting the
[54:39] meeting I was speaking to brother auma
[54:42] from
[54:43] kja and I was telling him you have a lot
[54:46] of cows
[54:48] there you can decide to donate two
[54:52] CS he said yes pastor we can decide to
[54:54] do that
[54:57] but maybe for the future
[55:00] meeting but I think it would be a
[55:02] wonderful thing if you receive the
[55:03] donation of cows
[55:08] from amen and if you have cows you
[55:11] yourself can donate we want two cows for
[55:15] the we believe that God can do
[55:18] anything these are meetings the vision
[55:21] was given to us by the
[55:24] Lord
[55:26] expectant for what the Lord will do in
[55:29] our country among our young people and
[55:32] the younger
[55:33] generation brothers that are coming that
[55:35] are invited to
[55:38] come to minister to the young people
[55:40] they have quite a a good uh amount of
[55:45] experience ministering to the young
[55:47] people all over the
[55:49] world these are are people I could say
[55:52] they are on high
[55:54] demand
[55:57] but for for them to accept our
[56:01] invitation it means that the Lord has
[56:04] something for the young
[56:05] people in not only our country but our
[56:11] region because we are also having quite
[56:13] a good number coming from

[56:31] three I don't know how many will come

[56:34] there and and and some other countries
[56:36] as well so I believe it's going to be a
[56:39] feasting
[56:41] time I'd like us to be in prayer for
[56:44] those
[56:45] meetings um for the Lord to move in a
[56:48] special
[56:49] way and those who have
[56:52] contributed I don't have the list before

[1:34:59] God and coming before you this
[1:35:02] morning we come
[1:35:04] boldly before your throne of
[1:35:07] Mercy the throne of
[1:35:10] grace because we know you have a table
[1:35:14] spray and you want to encourage
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:19] someone Lord you want to do that this
[1:35:23] morning come and have your

[1:35:36] pray in the name of
[1:35:38] Jesus please be seated God
[1:35:42] bless God bless you
[1:35:48] musicians praise God
[1:36:08] overcoming the spirit of
[1:36:12] discouragement that's what I'm speaking
[1:36:13] about this
[1:36:15] morning now discouragement comes from
[1:36:18] the word
[1:36:20] courage
[1:36:25] the
[1:36:26] word discouragement is the opposite of
[1:36:30] [Music]
[1:36:32] Courage discouragement is losing the
[1:36:35] courage to
[1:36:43] continue espcially when we have lost our
[1:36:50] motivation to
[1:36:51] [Music]
[1:36:53] continue when you
[1:36:55] lose the motivation to press
[1:37:01] forward you know when you lose because
[1:37:05] maybe the valley is too
[1:37:10] step or maybe the valley is too
[1:37:15] dark and maybe the battle is
[1:37:19] fierce and then you become
[1:37:24] discouraged when you are
[1:37:26] discouraged you cannot
[1:37:29] overcome when you are discouraged you
[1:37:32] cannot move
[1:37:33] forward when you are
[1:37:36] discouraged you are
[1:37:39] bound it's not that you don't have
[1:37:42] potential you still have the potentials
[1:37:45] within
[1:37:46] you but when you are
[1:37:49] discouraged you don't see your potential
[1:37:52] anymore when you are discouraged you
[1:37:55] only look at the
[1:37:57] difficulty you only look at the
[1:37:59] problem you look at how Fierce the
[1:38:02] battle
[1:38:04] is amen you look at how dark it
[1:38:10] is now I have three
[1:38:14] daughters and one of themba where is
[1:38:18] she is she anywhere around here
[1:38:22] oh right here praise God she's a
[1:38:26] beautiful young
[1:38:27] lady but while growing up I noticed
[1:38:29] among the three of
[1:38:34] them that there is one thing that disc
[1:38:36] she's very
[1:38:38] bold very bold actually she's more
[1:38:41] confident than her elder
[1:38:43] sister but there is one thing that
[1:38:46] discourages and that is
[1:38:50] Darkness
[1:38:52] last night power went
[1:38:54] off you know uh I don't know whether
[1:38:57] women ever
[1:38:59] sleep my wife told me in the we hours of
[1:39:01] the night she came in our
[1:39:06] room I I was dead asleep I didn't I
[1:39:09] didn't see her so mothers God bless you
[1:39:12] let us give a hand to
[1:39:14] mothers they're
[1:39:16] wonderful so if shba was in our
[1:39:20] room because it was dark in her
[1:39:23] room I don't know how she senses
[1:39:27] Darkness it's like she has a
[1:39:30] sensor the moment power goes off even if
[1:39:33] she was sleeping for two hours she will
[1:39:36] wake up
[1:39:38] immediately she senses
[1:39:40] darkness and she fears Darkness even if
[1:39:44] she's a strong
[1:39:45] woman very confident very strong but
[1:39:49] that one
[1:39:50] discourages
[1:39:51] praise God I just gave an example of my
[1:39:55] daughter because I know I will go back
[1:39:57] at home and kiss and she'll forget what
[1:40:01] I but right now it is boiling down in
[1:40:05] our but each of us
[1:40:07] here we have things that discourage
[1:40:11] us although when we are before people
[1:40:13] want to put up a good
[1:40:17] face and you don't want people to know
[1:40:19] that you are discouraged
[1:40:22] but you know God knows you're
[1:40:24] discouraged and that's why he gave me
[1:40:25] this sermon this
[1:40:29] morning many people get discouraged to
[1:40:32] continue they don't want to press
[1:40:35] forward they to press
[1:40:37] forward because it is too
[1:40:40] dark because the battle is so
[1:40:43] Fierce and the
[1:40:45] motivation to press
[1:40:48] forward doing
[1:40:49] those and now this being the first
[1:40:52] service in this new
[1:40:55] year in this last month of the old
[1:40:59] year I'm realizing that we are getting
[1:41:01] into the new
[1:41:03] year and many people who had set
[1:41:07] goals but this year I will do this and
[1:41:11] this and this and this and this how many
[1:41:14] here achieved everything they wanted to
[1:41:15] achieve this
[1:41:18] year everything
[1:41:24] how many are a little discouraged that
[1:41:26] they were not able to achieve what they
[1:41:28] wanted to
[1:41:29] [Music]
[1:41:32] achieve okay those ones are a little
[1:41:36] discouraged how many are really
[1:41:38] discouraged because they acheve
[1:41:43] something God bless you how many are
[1:41:47] very
[1:41:49] discouraged
[1:41:54] all right God bless you this message is
[1:41:57] for you this
[1:41:59] morning the ones who are not
[1:42:02] discouraged the service is
[1:42:04] dismissed the ones who are discouraged
[1:42:06] this
[1:42:07] morning this service is for you this
[1:42:09] morning and I trust that the Lord will
[1:42:11] minister to your
[1:42:12] soul so please pay attention let us see
[1:42:16] what the Lord has for us and someone
[1:42:18] asked me the other day actually two or
[1:42:20] three people ask asked me a
[1:42:22] question said pastor I've been going
[1:42:24] through the whole
[1:42:26] year and I see that you've been
[1:42:28] preaching a lot of
[1:42:29] sermons and this time you preach you
[1:42:31] preach a fresh
[1:42:34] inspiration how do you get these
[1:42:37] sermons and I told I said to the
[1:42:40] person honestly when he asked me I did
[1:42:42] not know the answer to
[1:42:44] be and when the second person asked me I
[1:42:47] I came to think of it I said why are
[1:42:48] they all asking me the same thing
[1:42:53] here is what I want to tell you it's not
[1:42:56] about me or the
[1:42:58] preacher it is about God and your
[1:43:02] need God knows your
[1:43:04] need and that's why he inspires the
[1:43:07] preacher to preach about your
[1:43:11] need because God wants to take you out
[1:43:13] of your
[1:43:15] situation that's why when you are
[1:43:16] hearing a preacher preach and he
[1:43:19] preaching about your condition
[1:43:21] the preacher knows nothing about your
[1:43:23] condition but God knows your condition
[1:43:26] and he's inspiring the preacher to talk
[1:43:29] about it so you can build
[1:43:32] Faith come out of
[1:43:34] it if you understand it say
[1:43:37] amen and so I was asking the Lord what
[1:43:40] will I speak about this
[1:43:42] morning and then you know those words
[1:43:44] just came in my ears overcoming the
[1:43:47] spirit of
[1:43:49] discouragement praise the name of the
[1:43:51] Lord I I want us to take it this way I
[1:43:53] will begin in the Old
[1:43:56] Testament where I want us to see an
[1:43:59] example of people that were
[1:44:03] discouraged there many people who have
[1:44:04] been discouraged in this
[1:44:07] life some of them
[1:44:09] prophets others lay
[1:44:12] members others just
[1:44:14] Believers people are being discouraged
[1:44:16] each
[1:44:17] time it's not a new thing to be
[1:44:20] discouraged
[1:44:22] it is a same old
[1:44:25] story tell the devil is the same old
[1:44:30] Story the reason why the devil
[1:44:32] discourages
[1:44:33] you is because he wants you to give
[1:44:37] up brother sh can you give me a little
[1:44:39] more sound my voice is really cracky
[1:44:40] this morning he wants you to give
[1:44:42] up that's why he
[1:44:45] discourage he wants you to give up tell
[1:44:48] your neighbor he wants you to give up
[1:44:51] but I'm here this morning as an angel of
[1:44:54] the Lord to you telling you don't give
[1:44:57] up don't give up no retreat no surrender
[1:45:03] the moment you
[1:45:04] decided you must go through with the
[1:45:07] thing you must finish the thing you are
[1:45:10] not going to be like you you are going
[1:45:13] to be like Jesus when Jesus came down
[1:45:15] from heaven he came down to the Earth he
[1:45:19] came determined
[1:45:21] to die for the
[1:45:22] siners he was determined and the devil
[1:45:26] discouraged him many times he even came
[1:45:30] through his
[1:45:32] disciple Peter and he told him why do
[1:45:36] you have to die why why why the moment
[1:45:40] Jesus realized that was the
[1:45:42] devil discouraging him he turned to
[1:45:45] Peter he said get behind me
[1:45:49] Satan Jesus realized it was not Peter
[1:45:54] discouraging him there was a spirit
[1:45:57] behind
[1:45:58] Peter trying to discourage
[1:46:01] Jesus from pressing
[1:46:03] forward brother sister it is not your
[1:46:06] sister it is not your brother it is not
[1:46:09] your mother it's not your friend there
[1:46:12] is a spirit and that spirit is called
[1:46:18] discouragement so I want to expose
[1:46:20] that Spirit
[1:46:22] today and after I've exposed it we all
[1:46:25] shall be more than
[1:46:29] conquerors the spirit that spirit is one
[1:46:32] of the most filthy
[1:46:35] Spirits even people who are destined for
[1:46:38] great
[1:46:39] [Music]
[1:46:40] things have been tempted by that
[1:46:43] Spirit of
[1:46:45] discouragement and Jesus when he was
[1:46:48] tempted by it he found out he said I'm
[1:46:51] not going to give up I've gone too far
[1:46:54] to give
[1:46:56] back I've gone too far to look
[1:46:59] back I am not going to give up I wonder
[1:47:02] how many will say the same thing here
[1:47:04] today I've gone too far to look
[1:47:07] back amen I love sister what you posted
[1:47:10] on the
[1:47:12] group said I've counted the
[1:47:15] cost and I've still made up my
[1:47:18] mind the cost is great but I've still
[1:47:22] made up my mind not to give
[1:47:24] up Hallelujah the cost of serving
[1:47:28] Jesus the cost of living for for the
[1:47:31] world is very dear very
[1:47:35] expensive you have to
[1:47:37] sacrifice but are you made up in your
[1:47:41] mind not to
[1:47:43] give in the book of Exodus
[1:47:47] 5
[1:47:49] 22
[1:47:51] maybe someone is on the brink of giving
[1:47:57] up let us try to deal with you this
[1:48:01] morning vers
[1:48:05] 22 Hallelujah and Moses returned unto
[1:48:09] the Lord and said Lord what hast thou so
[1:48:13] evil ined this people why is it that
[1:48:17] thou Hast sent me for since I came to
[1:48:20] pharaoh to speak in thy name he has done

[1:50:26] Creator God God lifts up
[1:50:29] this and he showed him nothing will be

[1:51:00] everybody should believe you are going
[1:51:02] on the streets you are telling
[1:51:07] every this is so powerful and then Moses
[1:51:11] reached a time everything he
[1:51:13] did and Pharaoh tightened the
[1:51:18] nut and he made the children of Israel
[1:51:20] to suffer even
[1:51:23] more than before Moses
[1:51:27] came mes saw
[1:51:30] that I thought my Ministry was

[1:51:38] happened heed doing the
[1:51:41] same still PHA
[1:51:44] Harden
[1:51:46] tightened the children of Isel to
[1:51:48] suffer in a greater
[1:51:52] way Moses who was on
[1:51:54] fire he
[1:51:56] reduced he said there is a
[1:52:01] problem there is a problem with
[1:52:04] God do you think that was Moses
[1:52:07] speaking it was the spirit of
[1:52:11] disc it was right

[1:52:59] them so God tell me who is the problem
[1:53:02] is it me Pharaoh is it you who not
[1:53:06] delivered them that was the spirit of
[1:53:10] discouragement trying to
[1:53:13] discourage the man of God from
[1:53:17] realizing that God was
[1:53:21] powerful there is no
[1:53:23] word there is no word that God has given
[1:53:28] that he is not intending to
[1:53:31] fulfill oh my you people help me pre
[1:53:33] this morning every word that God has
[1:53:38] given whether by word or by Vision or by
[1:53:43] dream my prophecy he will
[1:53:47] accomplish because he's God
[1:53:50] he is God tell somebody he is
[1:53:53] God God is God and he never
[1:53:57] fail he never
[1:54:00] fails but the people they always listen
[1:54:03] to that
[1:54:05] Spirit the spirit of
[1:54:07] discouragement it will always come and
[1:54:10] find you in those
[1:54:12] moments when you are
[1:54:15] alone it will wait until I finish my

[2:24:39] witness will not lie but a false
[2:24:43] witness will utter
[2:24:45] lies now
[2:24:47] the spirit of
[2:24:50] discouragement is connected to the
[2:24:53] spirit of a false
[2:25:00] witness and it uses
[2:25:04] lies to overpower

[2:25:36] homes it's in
[2:25:39] families it's in churches it's in

[2:25:53] things does the Lord
[2:25:56] hate and seven an Abomination unto

[2:30:59] how you have betrayed
[2:31:03] me brother sister have you reach that
[2:31:07] level whereby you will even love your
[2:31:10] enemy even when someone goes and speaks
[2:31:13] something against
[2:31:14] you you still have no B
[2:31:17] for if there is one thing that God gave
[2:31:20] me since I received the Holy Spirit was
[2:31:23] love in my heart I have not bit against
[2:31:27] anyone in the
[2:31:28] world I remember there is one day I had
[2:31:33] I had bitterness in my heart and I said
[2:31:36] oh God but I I thought I have the Holy
[2:31:38] Ghost said oh God help me and I was
[2:31:41] preaching and I was preacher and I was
[2:31:43] traveling and and I thought I he had the
[2:31:47] Holy
[2:31:47] Spirit but maybe he had received
[2:31:49] emotions of I don't know but let me tell
[2:31:52] you that's why we should every time
[2:31:54] receive experience
[2:31:57] experence and then one day I was in
[2:32:00] China in the city of
[2:32:02] shenzen and I was feeling this
[2:32:04] bitterness in my heart about this person
[2:32:07] what they did to me how they did it how
[2:32:09] they plan
[2:32:10] it and then all of a sudden I was like
[2:32:14] oh God
[2:32:17] this person didn't mean it the Holy
[2:32:20] Spirit began
[2:32:22] conving he didn't mean
[2:32:24] it I saw this Chinese
[2:32:27] people who can't even speak my language
[2:32:30] but they love me
[2:32:40] they and then I was like oh one brother

[2:49:20] Summer that you overcome this seven
[2:49:24] things you have already overcome the
[2:49:26] speed of
[2:49:29] disc now in the next few minutes let us
[2:49:32] let us continue with the with the Israel
[2:49:34] and then we shall
[2:49:37] conclude in the in in Numbers Chapter
[2:49:41] [Music]
[2:49:43] 13
[2:49:46] Moses in numbers 13: 20 T the spies to
[2:49:49] the uh uh tells the spies to be of good
[2:49:56] courage and let us see their report on
[2:49:59] their
[2:50:03] return after Moses told them be of good
[2:50:06] courage go you can take the
[2:50:10] land numbers
[2:50:13] 13:2 everyone turn there if you
[2:50:18] can and they returned from searching of
[2:50:20] the land after 40
[2:50:22] days and they went and came to Moses and
[2:50:25] to Aaron and to all the congregation of
[2:50:27] the children of Israel and to the
[2:50:28] Wilderness of Peron to Cades and brought
[2:50:31] back word unto them and said unto the
[2:50:35] congregation and showed them the fruit
[2:50:37] of the
[2:50:39] land can you read
[2:50:43] that
[2:50:57] [Music]
[2:51:05] so they admitted the land had
[2:51:09] fruits the land was good the land was am
[2:51:16] as as God had
[2:51:18] said verse 27 and they told him and said
[2:51:23] we came unto the land with thou sentest
[2:51:25] us and surely it floweth with milk and
[2:51:28] honey and this is the fruit of
[2:51:36] [Music]
[2:51:38] it nevertheless the people be strong
[2:51:40] that dwell in the land and the cities
[2:51:42] are world and very great and moreover we
[2:51:44] saw the children of an
[2:51:48] [Music]
[2:51:53] there the aites dwell in the land of the
[2:51:56] South and the Hittites and the jebusites
[2:51:58] and the amorites dwell in the mountains
[2:52:00] and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and
[2:52:02] by the coast of
[2:52:13] Jordan I have a
[2:52:15] question what what was um what was the
[2:52:20] work that Moses gave these
[2:52:25] spies does anybody
[2:52:28] know what was the work they were
[2:52:30] supposed to
[2:52:33] do they were supposed to go and do
[2:52:38] what
[2:52:42] sorry and give the report
[2:52:46] but now what kind of
[2:52:50] spy they wanted they was to
[2:52:54] go and
[2:52:56] see if everything is the way God said it
[2:53:04] was if the land is good flow with milk
[2:53:08] and and whether everything is there and
[2:53:13] whether they will take the land
[2:53:15] so they came back said it is true the
[2:53:19] land is there it's good even the fruits
[2:53:21] are here but now whatever they were
[2:53:25] going to
[2:53:26] say was
[2:53:31] unnecessary you
[2:53:33] know the americ here the amorites
[2:53:38] the the of an
[2:53:42] canites it's very difficult
[2:53:46] and while they were speaking CED the
[2:53:49] people in verse
[2:53:51] 30 he said let us go up at
[2:53:56] once and possess it for we are well able
[2:54:01] to before
[2:54:04] spoke
[2:54:06] everybody at first when they saw the
[2:54:08] fruit
[2:54:11] com the land is there the is there
[2:54:15] let us what they have to
[2:54:16] say is there it's good it's
[2:54:23] with everybody was excited but there are
[2:54:28] also Amit
[2:54:31] an and very
[2:54:36] difficult they became
[2:54:38] discouraged it was a false
[2:54:41] witness that delivered lies
[2:54:46] wait did I say lies yes but was it not
[2:54:54] realities it was
[2:54:56] real but it was
[2:54:58] lies because it's not what God
[2:55:03] say do you get it brother am if you got
[2:55:05] it say
[2:55:08] amen and had them speaking their Liv he
[2:55:12] said wait wait wait everybody shut up I
[2:55:16] don't want to know
[2:55:18] anything let us get up at
[2:55:21] once and take the land we are able to
[2:55:25] overcome the 10 were clouded with the
[2:55:27] strength of their
[2:55:30] [Music]
[2:55:34] enemies you know that the promise became
[2:55:36] so de before
[2:55:40] they I'm coming to the climax of this so
[2:55:42] don't don't shut up on me now
[2:55:46] follow me closely here the the
[2:55:49] promise became so de in their
[2:55:53] eyes because of how big their enemy
[2:55:57] was and as a result they gave a very
[2:56:01] discouraging
[2:56:05] testimony and I want to say we are given
[2:56:09] a
[2:56:10] promise we are to focus on the promise
[2:56:15] tell your neighbor we are to focus on
[2:56:16] the
[2:56:18] promise not the realities of
[2:56:27] impossibilities they are
[2:56:29] realities and they look
[2:56:31] impossible we are not to focus on
[2:56:35] that like
[2:56:37] say let us go up at
[2:56:40] once and possess the land we are able to
[2:56:45] overcome
[2:56:46] it and now look at
[2:56:49] this the the others did not shut
[2:56:54] up they
[2:56:56] continued with their
[2:56:59] discouraging
[2:57:05] real I wish you would get that
[2:57:09] [Music]
[2:57:13] word
[2:57:16] are you hearing me
[2:57:17] Church verse 31 and the man that went up
[2:57:21] with him
[2:57:23] said we are not able to go
[2:57:26] up against the people for they are
[2:57:29] stronger than
[2:57:30] we reality number
[2:57:34] one and they brought up an evil report
[2:57:37] of the
[2:57:39] land an evil
[2:57:41] reports oh my God why was it evil
[2:57:45] because is not what God
[2:57:50] Said the land thought that which we have
[2:57:53] gone
[2:57:55] to to search it is a land that eats up
[2:57:58] the inhabitants
[2:58:01] there and all the people that we saw in
[2:58:03] it are men of great
[2:58:07] sture and there we saw the
[2:58:09] Giants the sons of anak which come to
[2:58:13] the to of which come of the
[2:58:15] Giants and we are in our own in their

[2:58:36] facts fact number one the canites were
[2:58:40] stronger than the
[2:58:42] Israelites if it is true you say
[2:58:47] Amen the
[2:58:50] canites were men of great
[2:58:58] sture the sons of Anna were
[2:59:03] giants
[2:59:05] Israelis looked like little
[2:59:10] grass is that
[2:59:12] correct however
[2:59:15] these were
[2:59:17] facts according to the physical
[2:59:23] eyes I don't know if somebody's
[2:59:26] get these were facts according to what
[2:59:30] they were
[2:59:32] saying to repeat these
[2:59:37] facts is to give an evil
[2:59:40] report of the
[2:59:42] land
[2:59:51] that was the spirit of
[2:59:54] discouragement being breathed on the
[2:59:57] [Music]
[2:59:59] people they had to take God at his
[3:00:04] word they did not have to look at the
[3:00:10] facts can we bring it down to today
[3:00:14] as we
[3:00:15] conclude the facts
[3:00:18] today I try to list them
[3:00:23] here my page was filling up I couldn't
[3:00:25] [Music]
[3:00:30] finish the
[3:00:32] fact is that you may not be highly
[3:00:40] educated is that a fact today
[3:00:45] among many
[3:00:50] Christians is that not
[3:00:52] true is that not a
[3:00:55] fact you may not even
[3:00:59] know how to write your
[3:01:01] name don't we have many Christians like
[3:01:07] that not knowing how to write your
[3:01:10] name all right that's a fact
[3:01:17] reality you may not be
[3:01:20] rich brother

[3:01:28] rich brother Andrew are you
[3:01:35] rich they are not answering
[3:01:38] me sister f are you
[3:01:42] rich
[3:01:47] are
[3:01:51] you you
[3:01:55] confused at least I trust someone
[3:01:59] here are you
[3:02:04] rich who's a rich man
[3:02:08] here I'm trying to find
[3:02:12] someone

[3:02:33] in Jesus
[3:02:36] name that's true is what God God's word
[3:02:42] said but now can we surely the
[3:02:45] reality
[3:02:47] real sinc
[3:02:49] speaking are you rich no
[3:02:56] no God bless you now I just discouraged
[3:03:02] you you said you are rich you came here
[3:03:05] on fire walking like a rich man and then
[3:03:09] all of the sudden you said no I'm not
[3:03:12] rich
[3:03:14] you are the one who said you is it me
[3:03:16] who forced you to
[3:03:17] say I simply asked you to say the
[3:03:20] reality and you said the
[3:03:24] reality that's how the reality
[3:03:29] is and that's how the devil
[3:03:32] discourages after the
[3:03:35] P say you are rich the word of God says
[3:03:38] the blessing of God it makes you rich
[3:03:41] you say amen I am rich
[3:03:48] [Music]
[3:03:54] you see so the fact is the reality is we
[3:04:00] are
[3:04:04] poor that's the reality that's the
[3:04:08] fact I'm sorry if you are
[3:04:10] rich but even if you are rich you are
[3:04:16] poor because that money is
[3:04:20] nothing and the fact is many Believers
[3:04:23] don't have much
[3:04:26] money the fact is even in our own
[3:04:30] assembly many people don't eat all
[3:04:32] [Music]
[3:04:35] meals is not not is that not so that's
[3:04:40] the reality the we know this
[3:04:44] things that's the
[3:04:45] fact all right another fact is that many
[3:04:49] of us come from a very poor
[3:04:56] background we are not only poor our but
[3:05:00] even we come from a very
[3:05:02] [Music]
[3:05:04] poor you don't even remember who drove
[3:05:10] a that's
[3:05:12] true
[3:05:13] now another
[3:05:15] reality is that many of
[3:05:18] you you are the devil pulls you deep in
[3:05:24] sin that when you're not in church out
[3:05:28] there The Temptations are
[3:05:33] real they are
[3:05:35] real I'm not supposed to lie but sinc
[3:05:39] how can
[3:05:40] I I need to tell
[3:05:42] a God will give
[3:05:44] Mery that's the
[3:05:46] reality it is here it's on the
[3:05:50] ground you know it God knows it the
[3:05:53] devil knows
[3:05:55] it those three you can't
[3:05:57] lie is the reality and that's why when
[3:06:00] the Devil comes he comes to say what did
[3:06:04] you say that you're born
[3:06:12] again
[3:06:14] let us
[3:06:16] beere what what kind of
[3:06:18] life that do you live can you say you
[3:06:22] don't tell
[3:06:23] Li can you say you don't
[3:06:27] have say the
[3:06:29] truth young people if I call you
[3:06:34] here who who can I call let
[3:06:37] me and I ask you that brother you don't
[3:06:42] have
[3:06:43] do you say amen I
[3:06:49] don't I'll call someone
[3:06:51] here I'll call someone here right
[3:06:54] now and we ask them after they tell us
[3:06:58] yeah
[3:07:00] pastor but say the
[3:07:03] reality to be
[3:07:07] sincere to look
[3:07:09] down even if they say yeah yeah still
[3:07:13] they say it when they looking
[3:07:15] down because now it's the fact it's the
[3:07:20] reality the devil knows
[3:07:23] that you know it and God knows
[3:07:28] it it's the
[3:07:31] reality oh we don't have to be sick but
[3:07:35] the reality is even as I speak many of
[3:07:39] you are
[3:07:42] sick
[3:07:43] and are taking
[3:07:45] medicine how many are on
[3:07:48] medic right

[3:08:04] many here who have not raised up their
[3:08:06] hand if I was to tell them to be
[3:08:10] sincere they will still raise up
[3:08:14] on
[3:08:16] medication I'm telling you the
[3:08:20] facts now the other fact we are
[3:08:29] outnumbered that is true in many ways as
[3:08:33] as far as the church is
[3:08:35] concerned the Pentecostals are
[3:08:38] bigger as far as your enemies they're
[3:08:41] bigger that's the
[3:08:43] reality the religions and
[3:08:47] denominations and we are
[3:08:50] few now can I can I continue going
[3:08:53] [Music]
[3:08:55] down some of you the month just ended it
[3:08:59] is start
[3:09:01] December the reality is you may not have
[3:09:04] money to pay your
[3:09:07] [Music]
[3:09:11] rent in a wrong crowd
[3:09:16] today that's the
[3:09:18] reality right now I'm preaching but you

[3:09:25] rent how will
[3:09:27] I I will not pick up her call or his
[3:09:31] call it's the
[3:09:35] reality you are laughing because you

[3:10:26] you you may be
[3:10:30] jobless praise God and you have no
[3:10:35] job and you know is the
[3:10:38] truth that's why you don't even come to
[3:10:40] church sometimes because you have no
[3:10:41] transport
[3:10:45] for the church our
[3:10:48] land it is very
[3:10:51] expensive is that a
[3:10:54] reality is it is it not a
[3:10:58] fact it is even going
[3:11:01] higher more and more
[3:11:04] expensive the reality
[3:11:07] is if we continue collecting
[3:11:10] money the reality is we may buy in a
[3:11:13] minimum of 10
[3:11:19] years people are now

[3:11:58] Fe and because of
[3:12:05] all you right now in reality you may be
[3:12:11] totally discouraged
[3:12:18] and that's why you are very
[3:12:20] quiet because I know I've discouraged
[3:12:22] all of
[3:12:24] you I've reminded
[3:12:26] you of your healing

[3:13:53] facts but those facts which you just
[3:13:56] heard me
[3:13:58] say are the same
[3:14:00] facts which do 10 men

[3:14:07] land with their eyes they said the
[3:14:11] land that
[3:14:13] its own
[3:14:15] people the land has giant the land is

[3:14:32] said what are you talking about let us
[3:14:35] go
[3:14:36] at and take the land so we are more than
[3:14:41] able take
[3:14:44] not because of your fake
[3:14:48] realities I don't see those Realties I

[3:15:06] very many listen
[3:15:08] here when I started writing
[3:15:10] promises I could not finish
[3:15:13] also but let me tell you some of his
[3:15:16] promises the word of God says we shall
[3:15:19] be heads and
[3:15:21] not how many believe
[3:15:24] that we shall L to the

[3:16:04] you now some of these
[3:16:08] promises you will die without
[3:16:09] accomplishing
[3:16:10] them not because
[3:16:13] it is not promising but because you
[3:16:15] either not believe
[3:16:16] it or you did not attain that level of
[3:16:21] faith if it is revealed to
[3:16:24] you then you shall have

[3:17:41] is in you
[3:17:43] is greater than he that is in the
[3:17:46] world someone ought to stand up and
[3:17:50] say I accept that I receive that for me
[3:17:55] the Bible says we have a great cloud of
[3:17:59] witnesses so we may look like we are
[3:18:02] alone but we are not
[3:18:04] alone we are not alone we outnumber the
[3:18:10] devil we outn our
[3:18:13] enemy we outnumber them that's why the
[3:18:16] Bible says they shall fall by our by our
[3:18:20] left and right side who does that he
[3:18:24] that is in
[3:18:26] us the Bible says the angel of the Lord

[3:19:34] of
[3:19:35] discouragement I don't think it is still
[3:19:37] here but let me say this the Bible says
[3:19:40] the world

[3:19:44] fullness is the
[3:19:46] Lord he can decide to give you
[3:19:50] everything and anything you have need of

[3:20:19] with
[3:20:20] our it is being
[3:20:24] realistic speaking the truth spiritually
[3:20:31] realistic which can calm
[3:20:33] down by the power of the Holy SP and
[3:20:37] come in the reality of the
[3:20:39] body and happen
[3:20:44] by reality Abraham could not have a
[3:20:47] son for years and years and even by
[3:20:51] reality it came to a time when even if
[3:20:54] God would do a miracle their bodies was
[3:20:57] not able to carry a
[3:20:59] child but God is
[3:21:01] God God Is God When God is ready to move
[3:21:06] he can do
[3:21:07] anything he's the creator of Heaven and
[3:21:10] Earth he came down abrah he made him a
[3:21:13] young
[3:21:15] man you saw our

[3:21:42] pregnant who could do that the creator
[3:21:45] of Heaven and
[3:21:47] Earth I want to tell you
[3:21:50] brother nothing should discourage you
[3:21:53] because God is never
[3:21:55] let when God is provoked by
[3:21:59] prayer he fulfills every
[3:22:03] promise hallelujah amen he says he will
[3:22:06] give
[3:22:07] us the desire of our
[3:22:10] hearts a promise
[3:22:13] also the scripture says we are not of
[3:22:16] those that draw
[3:22:18] back let others draw

[3:25:31] [Music]
[3:25:34] me things are
[3:25:38] bad I will lay you down and beat you
[3:25:43] friends there is something I'm showing
[3:25:46] you it's not about the
[3:25:49] reality it's about the
[3:25:52] promise every the promise of
[3:25:55] God when
[3:25:57] believe
[3:25:59] sonter it cannot
[3:26:02] fail can fail it will be a compl he said
[3:26:07] he will give you the desire of your
[3:26:10] heart if you you want say I want to be a
[3:26:12] millionaire next
[3:26:14] year for example you brother you have a
[3:26:17] company you can say I'm no longer
[3:26:19] working for
[3:26:20] anyone I want to build my company next
[3:26:24] year and in two years I want to make my
[3:26:27] first
[3:26:29] million it is
[3:26:31] possible it is possible there is nothing
[3:26:34] impossible with
[3:26:36] God but the problem of Christians they
[3:26:39] don't believe the promise they in the 10
[3:26:42] Witnesses because they are more and they
[3:26:45] look more experienced and they
[3:26:48] elders but if you are wise listen to The
[3:26:52] Still small voice
[3:26:55] of Joshua and they said we are more than
[3:26:59] able to take the land brother to take
[3:27:02] the land sister amen raise up at once
[3:27:06] let's go and take the
[3:27:08] L and I also say we more than able to
[3:27:13] buy our church land we are more than
[3:27:16] able to build our church if the Lord Tes
[3:27:20] before the coming of the lord we are
[3:27:22] more than able to build a very wonderful
[3:27:27] structure and many Souls will be saved
[3:27:30] in there for the glory of God it is a
[3:27:34] promise if we desire it he would give it
[3:27:38] if you think I'm Dreaming just wait and
[3:27:41] see

[4:07:15] this little
[4:07:17] sister when I came to pray for those
[4:07:19] that I was praying
[4:07:20] [Music]
[4:07:22] for you know usually I don't ask for
[4:07:25] people what they want me to pray
[4:07:28] for because God knows
[4:07:30] it and I'm not a Catholic priest
[4:07:34] either I'm just a preacher and they tell
[4:07:39] God and I pray for them but usually when
[4:07:42] I pray I notic God inspires me on what
[4:07:48] to pray for so as I was praying for
[4:07:52] her I felt a little
[4:07:55] different that there was something
[4:07:57] special while she came on
[4:07:59] the you know children just always come
[4:08:03] and pray for them sometimes they do it
[4:08:06] because others are doing it
[4:08:09] but when I came to pray for her I felt a
[4:08:12] bit
[4:08:13] different that there is a specific
[4:08:16] reason why she
[4:08:17] came so here is how I prayed I said Lord
[4:08:20] you know the reason why she has
[4:08:23] come may you lead her even in her Young
[4:08:27] Life to meet you I didn't know that she
[4:08:30] was giving her life to
[4:08:32] Jesus praise
[4:08:35] God so why are you here
[4:08:38] [Music]
[4:08:43] I I want to receive Jesus Christ as my
[4:08:46] savior

[4:09:18] mother that she was going through an
[4:09:24] experience whenever she would come in
