[48:42] tired so he was
[48:45] inia and also he has been in um uh in
[48:52] Zana and he ministered here as
[48:55] well but it has come to time when he's

[49:51] times you think you are in a certain
[49:54] place and you are the only one
[49:58] like Elijah who thought that he was the
[50:00] only Prophet who was
[50:03] left
[50:06] told
[50:09] there so when you are in Zimbabwe you
[50:11] only think that the bride is in
[50:15] zimb but then when you get to travel you
[50:17] see a lot of
[50:20] other Saints who are part of the
[50:23] Bride who believe the same message its
[50:26] total
[50:29] it gives you
[50:31] hope that this indeed is nothing but the
[50:35] truth I would like to thank you
[50:38] greatly I know when I came here I was
[50:41] coming to a people who had their own
[50:46] programs but I would like to thank you

[50:52] way to make me feel comfortable
[50:56] [Music]
[50:57] some when they were supposed to be doing
[50:59] different deals and different
[51:02] things they would try to adjust so that
[51:08] I that means a
[51:10] lot may God richly bless
[51:14] you and I hope that we will meet
[51:18] again one way or the
[51:21] other if it is not on the side of the
[51:24] river
[51:28] we are going to meet again beyond the
[51:33] CST but
[51:36] this is the enest of our
[51:40] Salvation that we meet to
[51:44] part and we part to meet
[51:48] again may the good Lord bless you
[51:52] rich and may He put more where you

[1:14:55] an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[1:14:57] of God to the Saints which are at
[1:15:00] Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ
[1:15:03] Jesus Grace be to you and peace from God
[1:15:07] our
[1:15:08] Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:15:21] [Music]
[1:15:32] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:15:33] Lord Jesus Christ who have blessed us
[1:15:36] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:15:40] places
[1:15:50] in you're praying for
[1:15:53] blessings it's already done
[1:15:56] but the only way you can access this
[1:15:59] blessings if you are in
[1:16:01] Christ any other
[1:16:03] blessing that is outside of Christ it's
[1:16:06] going to ruin you the Bible says the
[1:16:10] blessings of the Lord they make rich and
[1:16:14] they add no
[1:16:15] sorrow so the kind of blessings that we
[1:16:17] want
[1:16:18] today are the
[1:16:20] blessings that we
[1:16:22] received when we were in Christ
[1:16:25] so let us go back in
[1:16:27] Christ and seek the blessing that we
[1:16:30] received when
[1:16:32] we
[1:16:34] according as he had chosen Us in him
[1:16:37] before the foundation of the
[1:16:42] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:16:45] Blame before him in
[1:16:50] love so we were chosen before the
[1:16:52] foundation of the world
[1:16:55] and you are chosen to be
[1:16:57] holy you are chosen to be
[1:17:01] blameless you are chosen to walk before
[1:17:04] him in
[1:17:06] love Abraham was told by
[1:17:09] God walk before me and be th
[1:17:13] perfect Jesus told the
[1:17:15] disciples be perfect even as your father
[1:17:19] in Heaven is
[1:17:20] perfect and you might ask how can I I am
[1:17:25] man a young woman inala how can I living
[1:17:31] in the in the street of
[1:17:33] Cala be able to be
[1:17:35] perfect I am facing
[1:17:37] Temptations right left and
[1:17:40] Center brother you are chosen to be
[1:17:44] perfect you are chosen to be holy you
[1:17:48] are chosen to be blameless let us go
[1:17:52] back to that place where this things can
[1:17:56] be
[1:17:58] possible the problem is we are
[1:18:04] unplugged we are unplugged from the
[1:18:06] source of our
[1:18:08] blessings we are unpluged from the
[1:18:10] source of our
[1:18:12] joy we are unpluged from the source of
[1:18:15] our
[1:18:16] happiness we are unpluged from the
[1:18:18] source of our
[1:18:19] peace but let us go back for we were
[1:18:23] chosen
[1:18:25] in
[1:18:26] Christ amen having predestinated
[1:18:30] us unto the adoption of children by
[1:18:33] Jesus Christ to
[1:18:35] himself according to the good
[1:18:38] pleasure of his
[1:18:41] [Music]
[1:18:49] will the prayer
[1:18:51] of not by Will
[1:18:55] but then be
[1:19:01] done does not only
[1:19:03] apply when you're going through the
[1:19:05] valley of the shadow of
[1:19:08] death sir it also applies to your
[1:19:12] Perfection it applies to your
[1:19:15] Redemption it applies to your
[1:19:18] restoration it applies all the way
[1:19:21] around not my will
[1:19:28] be to the praise of of the glory of his
[1:19:30] grace wherein he have made has accepted
[1:19:34] in the
[1:19:46] [Music]

[1:19:55] blood the Forgiveness of sins according
[1:19:56] to the riches of his grace amen you can
[1:19:59] have your

[1:22:35] mouthpiece that is
[1:22:37] repeating what he has already
[1:22:40] said so let us
[1:22:42] remember we are hearing what he has said
[1:22:47] so if I tell you now let me tell you
[1:22:50] something this thing is very serious
[1:22:53] when two people are in
[1:22:56] brother Bram says that the Bible is
[1:22:59] God's love story to his
[1:23:03] church you don't have to be smart to
[1:23:05] understand the
[1:23:07] Bible you have to have a humble
[1:23:10] heart and this love
[1:23:12] story it has been hid from the scholars
[1:23:14] in the
[1:23:15] world and it is only known by one
[1:23:19] thing yesterday we were
[1:23:21] hearing that the
[1:23:23] secret of
[1:23:24] of of the couples you know that have
[1:23:26] been married 20 30 40
[1:23:29] years the secret was the
[1:23:31] knees brother Bram is telling us the
[1:23:35] only way you can be able to understand
[1:23:37] the love
[1:23:39] story is not by
[1:23:41] theology but by
[1:23:44] neology brother sister I want to tell
[1:23:46] you the things that you're going to hear
[1:23:48] in today if you've been someone that has
[1:23:51] been on your
[1:23:52] knees calling to the Lord
[1:23:55] don't speak to me on that service I am
[1:23:58] going to your house speak to me you are
[1:24:01] going to hear from
[1:24:03] your he is known by
[1:24:06] neology and when two people are in
[1:24:09] love people in a
[1:24:11] relationship you can tell your
[1:24:13] wife get that thing get that
[1:24:17] thing put it in that place and give it
[1:24:21] to a certain
[1:24:23] brother and other thing that I put there
[1:24:26] you take it and give it to the sister
[1:24:29] you that are hearing what I'm
[1:24:31] saying it is Greek to
[1:24:33] you it is Greek to you it is French to
[1:24:37] you but to my wife she knows what I'm
[1:24:41] talking
[1:24:42] about because before I left the
[1:24:45] house there's this thing here there's
[1:24:48] this thing here there's this thing here
[1:24:51] and that is how it is between Christ
[1:24:55] and the pride he has hid these
[1:24:58] things from the wise and the
[1:25:03] pr and brother Bram would say when he
[1:25:07] was away in
[1:25:08] meeting the wife would write
[1:25:12] letter you know
[1:25:14] dear you know I'm sitting in the house
[1:25:17] here I'm writing you this letter it's
[1:25:20] been a very long
[1:25:21] day just put the kids to sleep
[1:25:25] brother Bram says that he can be able to
[1:25:28] read in between the
[1:25:30] lines he can be able to
[1:25:33] hear or read what the wife is not
[1:25:36] telling
[1:25:38] him why they're in
[1:25:41] Fellowship maybe that time if brother
[1:25:44] Bram was home after the K have been put
[1:25:47] to sleep maybe that is the time that
[1:25:52] sit honey love you so much do you
[1:25:55] remember the day that we got married

[1:26:27] lines I am in love with my
[1:26:32] wife but someone that is not in love
[1:26:35] with their
[1:26:36] wife they have no
[1:26:38] clue they have no
[1:26:40] idea and if you're not in love with
[1:26:43] Jesus if you do not take time to go
[1:26:45] through his
[1:26:47] letter understand what he's
[1:26:49] saying some of these things will be
[1:26:51] passing

[1:29:37] image of his
[1:29:39] son might be the firstborn among many

[1:30:17] it's a finished Ro
[1:30:18] sister I finished work in Christ
[1:30:22] Jesus and he says
[1:30:25] what shall we say then to these
[1:30:27] things if God be for us who can be
[1:30:31] against us he that spared not his own
[1:30:34] son that delivered him up for us
[1:30:40] all now I want us to draw a line
[1:30:44] today let's read this and then we shall
[1:30:46] We Shall We Shall zero on it as we go
[1:30:50] on but deliver him up for us all
[1:30:54] how shall he not with him also freely
[1:30:57] give us all
[1:31:02] things and then a question is asked here
[1:31:05] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:31:09] God's
[1:31:13] El it is God that
[1:31:16] justif I want to tell you something
[1:31:19] brother you are an
[1:31:21] elect it is God that justifies you
[1:31:25] it is God that is working on you brother
[1:31:28] sister I want to bring you to your
[1:31:30] realization where you get to see that
[1:31:33] you're living
[1:31:34] out a pre
[1:31:40] life
[1:31:43] Hallelujah
[1:31:45] Jesus did come to
[1:31:50] die you know he just came to die so
[1:31:53] whosoever will believe let them believe
[1:31:56] no sir it was for a purpose it was for a
[1:32:02] reason
[1:32:07] of let me read it for
[1:32:09] you me read it for you so that you
[1:32:11] believe
[1:32:13] it brother Bram says that God does not
[1:32:16] run his business like
[1:32:20] that he didn't just come to die up hazly
[1:32:25] he had a
[1:32:27] purpose he had a
[1:32:29] reason it was not just happening out of
[1:32:33] chance I think it's right here all right
[1:32:36] he says this God's covenant with
[1:32:40] Abraham he says now
[1:32:44] notice God when Satan done this evil
[1:32:48] thing here's what I think of God that he
[1:32:52] knew right then
[1:32:55] what will be the entire
[1:32:57] plan that he would use to bring man back
[1:33:01] to
[1:33:03] himself you know when the fall
[1:33:06] happened Adam had sinned Eve had oh
[1:33:11] Satan
[1:33:12] knew this is
[1:33:15] it God you kick me out of heaven and
[1:33:19] thought you going to make
[1:33:24] Jes
[1:33:26] God God but little did he
[1:33:30] know the jokes on you because what did
[1:33:34] God do he went and
[1:33:39] took saints Saints there's something I
[1:33:43] really want to
[1:33:44] bring I want you to help me now I want
[1:33:47] you to help me something needs to get
[1:33:49] home
[1:33:51] today so this is what happened
[1:33:55] there's a circle of
[1:33:57] Eternity you are a part of that
[1:34:02] eternity it's a
[1:34:04] circle it's a circle but now sin entered
[1:34:09] the world When sin entered the world a
[1:34:13] piece of that
[1:34:15] Circle
[1:34:16] broke when a piece of that Circle broke
[1:34:20] it came from
[1:34:21] eternity and dropped
[1:34:26] hallelujah amen look at it like
[1:34:30] this is a Son of God he fell do you know
[1:34:35] what happened he did not lose the
[1:34:39] designation of a Son of
[1:34:42] God he was a Son of God in a fallen
[1:34:46] condition so what does he become a
[1:34:49] fallen Son of
[1:34:51] God brother you are a son of God you are
[1:34:55] a daughter of God your situation does
[1:34:59] not change who you are it might change
[1:35:02] your
[1:35:03] name not change who you are you might be
[1:35:06] a fallen son
[1:35:08] of Son of God but still the predominant
[1:35:14] thing the
[1:35:17] denominator I am a Son of God a daughter
[1:35:20] of God chosen
[1:35:27] [Music]
[1:35:30] so the portion of the
[1:35:33] circle
[1:35:35] time it didn't
[1:35:37] change it was still a part of the
[1:35:43] CLE was still a part of the
[1:35:50] C hallelujah
[1:35:52] hallelujah you are
[1:35:54] not a creature of
[1:35:59] time passing
[1:36:02] time you're a creature of
[1:36:07] Eternity going through
[1:36:10] time you are not a man from Uganda
[1:36:14] and and that is why I am bringing a Reb
[1:36:17] if you did not come to church today
[1:36:19] because of the rain
[1:36:24] because you thought as Pastor was saying
[1:36:25] that you're going to
[1:36:28] melt you're taking the the scripture so
[1:36:33] liter and God formed man out of the
[1:36:38] ground that is the part you want to hold
[1:36:40] on
[1:36:42] to that you are formed out of the ground
[1:36:44] so
[1:36:50] you this body
[1:36:54] where do you come from my brother I come
[1:36:56] from Lake Victoria Islands this is soil
[1:36:59] from Lake
[1:37:02] Victoria but hidden in this
[1:37:05] flesh hidden in this flesh there is
[1:37:08] something that came from
[1:37:10] eternity there is something that came
[1:37:12] from
[1:37:13] God you did not come to church because
[1:37:15] of
[1:37:16] the challenge you
[1:37:19] today says you will not get anything
[1:37:23] from God without
[1:37:29] sacrifice forgive me if I'm going to be
[1:37:31] an
[1:37:33] evangelist I was telling Pastor that his
[1:37:36] last previous sermons have been very
[1:37:40] fiery they've been really really fir so
[1:37:43] I think
[1:37:44] I'm we can't go like
[1:37:47] this we cannot go on like this we cannot
[1:37:51] say that we've received a message
[1:37:54] that is going to change these
[1:37:56] bodies and it is these bodies keeping in
[1:37:59] our
[1:38:06] houses now I
[1:38:09] understand even if you do not invite me
[1:38:11] again
[1:38:16] fine there might be some
[1:38:18] reasons but I want to ask
[1:38:21] you is that a reason
[1:38:25] that if Jesus was coming to preach
[1:38:30] here would
[1:38:36] he we need to stop
[1:38:41] Jing we are not
[1:38:44] ugandans we are not
[1:38:47] ugandans so stop behaving like
[1:38:50] Uganda you are children of the most high
[1:38:52] God
[1:38:54] [Music]
[1:38:57] how do you expect the people in this
[1:39:00] area to be bringing people that are
[1:39:03] dying on their Death Beds for you to
[1:39:04] come and pray for them to rise up
[1:39:08] again they will come and find that
[1:39:10] nobody came to church because it
[1:39:14] was and we supposed to have a Ministry
[1:39:17] like that of
[1:39:19] Jesus the days of Jesus Christ wherever
[1:39:22] Jesus was they were actually removing
[1:39:24] the
[1:39:30] roofs we are not
[1:39:33] ugandans we are sons of
[1:39:35] God living in
[1:39:38] Uganda after our purpose in
[1:39:44] Uganda so let us stop behaving like
[1:39:48] ug ug spirit kick it out
[1:39:58] even in matters of
[1:40:01] traditions we do not want ugan
[1:40:09] tradition we are not transferring

[1:41:18] are we are a part of that Circle that
[1:41:20] came
[1:41:26] we are a part of that
[1:41:29] CLE amen this is what happened brother
[1:41:33] Bram says somewhere and he says this
[1:41:37] brother Bram he says I see let's read it
[1:41:41] we'll go back to my
[1:41:42] quote
[1:41:46] remember thank you so much for those
[1:41:47] that are flowing with me in the spirit
[1:41:49] thank
[1:41:50] you oh my feel so much wonderful so we
[1:41:55] see devil had
[1:41:57] come oh God the jokes on you these
[1:42:02] people that you think you're going to
[1:42:04] have another
[1:42:06] kingdom and God you actually said you've
[1:42:09] given him
[1:42:11] Dominion you've given him Authority
[1:42:14] you've made him a ruler of all the Flesh
[1:42:18] and I was just walking up and about
[1:42:19] naming the
[1:42:21] animals but now he has fallen God jokes
[1:42:25] on
[1:42:26] you he was there the other day telling
[1:42:30] this tree that was it seemed as if it
[1:42:33] was in the wrong
[1:42:35] place was operating
[1:42:38] the creation was bowing to
[1:42:41] him God jokes on you oh god oh jokes on
[1:42:47] you it is finished I've destroyed
[1:42:51] heaven and youve brought me on Earth
[1:42:55] I've also destroyed
[1:42:57] it and God is just
[1:42:59] [Music]
[1:43:01] there he's wondering what am I going to
[1:43:05] do and you see God he does not change
[1:43:09] his mind about
[1:43:11] his a moment you'll do that you shall
[1:43:13] surely
[1:43:14] die God was bound by his
[1:43:18] word he goes to
[1:43:21] Adam you know you know what Adam does
[1:43:24] blames it on the
[1:43:26] woman
[1:43:28] woman blames it on
[1:43:30] the do you realize
[1:43:32] something God never turned to The
[1:43:34] Serpent and asked the serpent why he did
[1:43:37] what he
[1:43:41] did what happens judgment
[1:43:46] strikes and then he turns to
[1:43:49] Adam you know what I'm going to do now
[1:43:53] this is so
[1:43:54] painful but he takes a
[1:43:56] lamb he takes a lamb and slays the
[1:43:59] L and it takes the
[1:44:02] clothes the skin allow me to paraphrase
[1:44:05] it because of
[1:44:06] time puts it on them and brother
[1:44:11] say and I want you to catch this
[1:44:14] words
[1:44:16] preparation and then when I see Adam as
[1:44:19] it was standing
[1:44:21] there and the beautiful St of
[1:44:26] her and while she's standing there these
[1:44:29] old bloody ship
[1:44:33] skins the blood of the ship skins
[1:44:35] running
[1:44:37] down God standing there pronouncing
[1:44:40] death
[1:44:42] destruction watch then I can see Eve put
[1:44:47] her lovely head over on Adam's
[1:44:55] this is a
[1:44:57] prophet when we read the message we said
[1:44:59] we are reading in between the lines
[1:45:03] right when brother Bram says I
[1:45:07] see a figment of his
[1:45:10] imagination this is an
[1:45:14] exodus an
[1:45:16] e as SE is opening
[1:45:19] up as he's saying I can see
[1:45:23] it is not thought on his
[1:45:25] head a sin is opening up
[1:45:28] before remember
[1:45:30] Moses wrote about
[1:45:32] Abraham he wrote about Genesis 1 and he
[1:45:38] says in the
[1:45:40] beginning God
[1:45:42] created Moses was was not in the
[1:45:46] beginning Moses was an eagle he could go
[1:45:51] back and we see something
[1:45:54] that's the Old
[1:45:55] Testament in the New Testament we find
[1:45:58] another
[1:45:59] E Matthew is the lion Matthew is the
[1:46:03] lion Matthew is the lion Matthew Mark
[1:46:06] Luke and
[1:46:08] John Matthew is Li and Then followed by
[1:46:14] and Then followed by Luke and then John
[1:46:17] Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:46:19] John the lion the ox
[1:46:24] the face of a man and an
[1:46:27] E look at the way John writes the
[1:46:30] gospel there is something
[1:46:32] different John among all the
[1:46:36] writers is the only one that could bring
[1:46:39] the of Jesus
[1:46:42] Christ as a lion portray him as a
[1:46:47] king king of
[1:46:49] the we are reading the Bible a frh
[1:46:53] the Bible has become a new
[1:46:55] book
[1:46:57] so an E when he says in the
[1:47:02] beginning he does not par
[1:47:07] Moses he qu
[1:47:10] Moses but he does not par
[1:47:16] Moses
[1:47:17] Elijah but does not part
[1:47:21] Elijah we are EOS
[1:47:24] we are not pars we set our
[1:47:27] wings and we fly and the higher we go
[1:47:32] better we able to
[1:47:34] see went higher what did he
[1:47:39] see in the beginning God created what
[1:47:43] did John see in the
[1:47:48] beginning hallelujah amen praise the
[1:47:52] Lord
[1:47:53] so when we have another
[1:47:55] Prophet that is right here and he says
[1:48:00] that I see this is not a fragment of his
[1:48:04] imagination he could
[1:48:06] see this is why mes wrot
[1:48:10] about that's why he wrote about
[1:48:14] Abraham he wrote about and
[1:48:17] evees wasn't
[1:48:19] there but he could see oh brother sister
[1:48:23] that was a first
[1:48:25] Exodus we've also received another
[1:48:27] Exodus
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] Prophet when he says he
[1:48:32] sees listen
[1:48:34] carefully because there's something
[1:48:36] right there and what time he looked what
[1:48:41] did he see he saw that the wife of
[1:48:46] zakas was called Rebecca
[1:48:53] praise God this are not just story
[1:48:56] say and then I can see he put her lovely
[1:49:00] [Music]
[1:49:06] head and and him put his arms around
[1:49:11] her they started
[1:49:13] weeping turned around and started
[1:49:16] walking out of his
[1:49:18] presence God depart from him he had
[1:49:22] sinned
[1:49:23] and there is your
[1:49:26] judgment when I can hear so he could
[1:49:29] also
[1:49:31] hear going down along that
[1:49:34] path through the garden
[1:49:37] of something like
[1:49:42] this what is it blood sh
[1:49:47] skins slapping on Adam's
[1:49:50] leg as he went down
[1:49:53] the ship
[1:49:54] skins against Adam's legs what is
[1:49:58] happening they walking
[1:50:00] out of the presence of God says let me
[1:50:04] tell you something each and everything
[1:50:06] in the spoken word each and everything
[1:50:09] in the message is there for a
[1:50:12] reason remember that sound and he says
[1:50:16] then I could see all that great spess
[1:50:20] eternity coming
[1:50:23] forming down like a
[1:50:25] funnel to four little words four little
[1:50:29] words l
[1:50:32] o children so
[1:50:35] much he couldn't turn them
[1:50:38] away then I hear him say stop I'll put
[1:50:44] anity
[1:50:47] seat what is God
[1:50:50] doing promising a Redemption
[1:50:53] he's making a
[1:50:54] preparation for a Redemption let's go to
[1:50:57] another
[1:50:58] message God's provided approach to
[1:51:00] Divine
[1:51:02] fellow this is what he says and I can
[1:51:06] see now I hear an old something bumping
[1:51:10] over the
[1:51:10] [Music]
[1:51:12] streets going out towards
[1:51:14] Calvary and as I look there was a little
[1:51:18] fellow the B said there was no beauty
[1:51:21] that we should desire him
[1:51:23] he had a cross on his
[1:51:25] shoulders and the blood stried across
[1:51:28] his
[1:51:28] back there was a mocking crown on on his
[1:51:32] face and they had spot on him and done
[1:51:34] all
[1:51:36] these and he says this as he starts up
[1:51:39] that
[1:51:40] mountain I see his garments just socked
[1:51:44] in
[1:51:46] blood splashing against the sides of his
[1:51:50] leg
[1:51:54] the first
[1:51:55] scenario the first scenario is the first
[1:52:00] Adam the second
[1:52:02] scenario second Adam there's one thing
[1:52:05] that is there there's a
[1:52:08] sound there's a sound the circle of
[1:52:12] Eternity has been
[1:52:14] broken it is coming falling into time
[1:52:18] that is Adam moving out of the presence
[1:52:21] of God
[1:52:24] the
[1:52:25] circle is broken that small
[1:52:29] piece coming down but the slapping sound
[1:52:34] there but now we see something else
[1:52:37] brother says I see his
[1:52:40] garments just soaked in
[1:52:43] blood
[1:52:45] previously God took a
[1:52:49] physical but now here comes one
[1:52:53] when he was washed at River Jordan the
[1:52:57] prophet made a
[1:52:59] declaration
[1:53:00] behold the lamp of
[1:53:02] God away
[1:53:04] the so now Adam had been covered with
[1:53:10] ship but now was the second ad the L of
[1:53:14] God
[1:53:17] himself
[1:53:19] Saints all that you need in this life
[1:53:23] is
[1:53:24] finished everything that you
[1:53:26] need it is finished what am I saying
[1:53:30] brother Jesus is that perfect
[1:53:35] sacrifice
[1:53:38] amen so he comes
[1:53:42] down the small piece of
[1:53:45] Eternity has fallen down and we are
[1:53:48] seeing another one the perfect L of God
[1:53:54] clothes Zing
[1:53:56] blood
[1:53:58] say that I want you to take
[1:54:01] it and describe it in your
[1:54:05] heart you know many times we struggle
[1:54:07] with so many
[1:54:09] things and this is simply because we do
[1:54:12] not
[1:54:14] understand did for us we don't
[1:54:18] understand what Calvary did for us
[1:54:23] I see his garments just
[1:54:27] socked splashing against the side of his
[1:54:32] leg a sight that no man that ever know
[1:54:36] what that meant could look
[1:54:47] and Saints I want to give you the
[1:54:50] secret of living an overcoming
[1:54:55] life you know sometimes we we can be
[1:54:59] confused when you preach when you preach
[1:55:01] a hard
[1:55:03] message this brother is
[1:55:06] legalist when you preach a soft
[1:55:08] message they tell you that oh brother
[1:55:10] you're not getting
[1:55:13] seen first of all I want you to
[1:55:16] understand message is
[1:55:18] hard whether it is soft I have no heaven
[1:55:22] to take
[1:55:23] you I have no heaven
[1:55:26] to if it is
[1:55:29] hard praise the Lord if it is soft
[1:55:33] praise the Lord but the bottom line is I
[1:55:37] have to tell you what the word of God
[1:55:42] say so if the Bible says you're the
[1:55:45] elect
[1:55:47] lady I have to tell you what the Bible
[1:55:50] calls you
[1:55:54] how you interpret it that's up to
[1:55:57] you but one thing my Prophet is telling
[1:56:00] me you cannot look at that
[1:56:03] site and know what it
[1:56:06] means and yet remain the
[1:56:12] same so if your life has been the
[1:56:15] same you need to go back to
[1:56:17] Calvary you need to get to understand
[1:56:19] what it means
[1:56:22] this is what it means
[1:56:24] brother the first Adam came down but now
[1:56:30] that piece of
[1:56:31] Eternity came down to
[1:56:34] time has to be restored
[1:56:37] back and now if something is
[1:56:40] broken there has to be
[1:56:43] glue that reconnects
[1:56:47] the what is this
[1:56:49] glue the thing that God used in the
[1:56:54] time was the blood of the
[1:56:57] L but now here comes the perfect
[1:57:01] sacrifice Adam had
[1:57:04] fallen and after Adam had fallen Jesus
[1:57:07] Christ came he
[1:57:10] condescended even lower than the
[1:57:15] Angels what was he coming to do he was
[1:57:19] coming to take that
[1:57:21] pie and as he's caring the
[1:57:24] cross he's going
[1:57:26] back Adam came from there with blood
[1:57:32] against Jesus is choosing you is
[1:57:36] choosing you and is speaking
[1:57:40] you
[1:57:46] with why is it taking you to reconnect
[1:57:50] you
[1:57:52] you came
[1:57:55] from
[1:57:56] Hallelujah brother why do you understand
[1:57:59] that you can never be the same
[1:58:02] again listen Saints Jesus did not come
[1:58:06] to
[1:58:07] die he knew what he was doing that's why
[1:58:11] John
[1:58:12] 3:16 God so
[1:58:14] loved that he gave his
[1:58:17] only that
[1:58:20] whosoever he does not say whosoever
[1:58:22] believes on
[1:58:25] him whoever believes in
[1:58:30] him those that were in
[1:58:33] him those that were in him those that
[1:58:36] were part of that
[1:58:38] Circle

[2:04:32] Eve Eve was already judged and
[2:04:37] condemn but you see Adam the Bible says
[2:04:40] Adam did not
[2:04:42] sin Adam was not
[2:04:45] beged was not
[2:04:47] deceived but you see Adam had a choice
[2:04:52] to let
[2:04:53] go and Adam would have remained with
[2:04:57] God but what did Adam
[2:05:05] [Music]

[2:07:15] living but now God knew one
[2:07:18] thing a type the way that Adam chose his
[2:07:25] wife let's look at what brother Bram
[2:07:28] says love the Lord
[2:07:30] Jesus says
[2:07:34] this
[2:07:35] [Music]
[2:07:37] church let us examine this first
[2:07:40] phrase as many as I
[2:07:43] love this was now the message to the
[2:07:45] ludan
[2:07:47] church in the Greek the emphasis is upon
[2:07:49] the personal pronoun I
[2:07:54] he does not say as many would feel he
[2:07:57] should
[2:07:59] say he does not
[2:08:01] say the way many other people would want
[2:08:04] him to
[2:08:06] say and what other people would want him
[2:08:08] to
[2:08:09] say is instead of as many as I
[2:08:14] love is instead to say as many as Love
[2:08:19] Me Now what people want God to
[2:08:24] say they want God to
[2:08:26] say as many as love
[2:08:29] me that is not what God
[2:08:32] says God says as many as I God
[2:08:39] love so I want you to get that
[2:08:42] distinction it's not about if you love
[2:08:45] God the question here is
[2:08:53] as many as God
[2:08:55] chooses as many as God
[2:08:58] justifies many as God
[2:09:01] call that is why they are
[2:09:07] called I hope you understand
[2:09:09] that praise the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:09:13] and we must never try to make Jesus the
[2:09:15] object of human love in this verse
[2:09:24] no it is the many that are the loved
[2:09:27] ones of
[2:09:31] God it is his love in question not
[2:09:38] ours are you catching what I'm
[2:09:40] saying you remember that story
[2:09:44] brother you know he's there and you know
[2:09:47] he'd left some meetings he'd been away
[2:09:49] for some time
[2:09:52] Rebecca and S the little girls were
[2:09:53] waiting for
[2:09:54] him unfortunately he arrived
[2:09:58] later and early the next morning he had
[2:10:02] gone and sat somewhere
[2:10:03] outside and Rebecca who's the eldest
[2:10:07] happened to wake up and
[2:10:09] you Dad
[2:10:12] out she was
[2:10:14] running and as she was running
[2:10:17] toward fortunately or
[2:10:20] unfortunately happened to Star Sarah as
[2:10:22] she was
[2:10:24] sleeping so what happened is Sarah woke
[2:10:27] up and she sleep what
[2:10:29] happened and you see Rebecca does not
[2:10:32] even tell her
[2:10:33] sister where she's going s
[2:10:37] justone and then Sarah catches a
[2:10:40] revelation she looks
[2:10:42] outside daddy's outside and she also
[2:10:45] follows and he said brother put like
[2:10:48] this Saints this are not stor
[2:10:53] the way we read the message is not like
[2:10:54] how we read the
[2:10:57] newspaper in between the
[2:11:00] lines the stories that brother Bram
[2:11:05] gives these are
[2:11:08] Parables do you believe that he was the
[2:11:10] son of
[2:11:11] man he was a son of man these are The
[2:11:15] Parables of a son
[2:11:16] of when we read the message we want to
[2:11:20] cut the message in a
[2:11:24] message praise the name of the Lord
[2:11:26] Jesus so you
[2:11:29] seeca is a little bit older so she can
[2:11:32] be able to run
[2:11:34] faster but you see sah is the she's a
[2:11:37] little bit
[2:11:38] smaller and at the same time you know
[2:11:40] how it is with families hand me downs I
[2:11:42] don't know how you call them here hand
[2:11:43] me downs the clothes of the
[2:11:48] elders so the clothes that Sarah was
[2:11:50] wearing
[2:11:53] actually a bit
[2:11:55] bigger
[2:11:59] was but eventually they all arrived buta
[2:12:04] arrived first and by the time Sarah is
[2:12:06] getting there you see Rebecca is all
[2:12:09] over the
[2:12:12] place and you know he's really she's
[2:12:15] really feeling
[2:12:16] herself and then turns to the turns to
[2:12:18] the
[2:12:19] sister and says
[2:12:25] ohcc I'm sorry Rebecca says to
[2:12:28] SAR I'm sorry you're too
[2:12:30] late I'm sorry there's no space for
[2:12:33] you I have all of
[2:12:38] that and you know how little girls
[2:12:40] sometimes
[2:12:42] are very
[2:12:45] emotional and she felt so sad brother
[2:12:48] bham catches
[2:12:51] extends the leg to
[2:12:53] sah and
[2:12:55] ask Sarah comes sits on the now there's
[2:13:00] also something here Sarah is
[2:13:03] tall so her feet able to reach the
[2:13:07] ground and she's very
[2:13:10] stable but
[2:13:12] unfortunately for for for Sarah she's a
[2:13:15] bit wobbly
[2:13:26] and here she has already been
[2:13:28] told I have all of
[2:13:30] daddy but then when brother Bram
[2:13:33] sees he holds her and secures her
[2:13:38] family and after some
[2:13:40] time Sarah turns to the
[2:13:43] sister my dear sister you
[2:13:45] know you're actually
[2:13:48] right you have a of dadd
[2:13:51] but can I tell you
[2:13:53] something
[2:13:54] Daddy
[2:13:56] Daddy has all of
[2:14:00] me that's what we are talking
[2:14:03] about that story of that
[2:14:06] girl knew the
[2:14:08] king but the king didn't know
[2:14:10] her so
[2:14:13] breaking but can we find
[2:14:16] joy can we find
[2:14:18] Comfort let's finish with this here
[2:14:22] praise the name of the Lord Jesus and he
[2:14:24] says so once again we find
[2:14:28] ourselves gloring in his
[2:14:32] salvation
[2:14:34] purpose and we are confirmed even more
[2:14:38] strongly in the truth of the doctrine of
[2:14:41] the sovereignity of
[2:14:44] God even as he said in Romans
[2:14:47] 9:13 Jacob have I loved
[2:14:51] does it now obtain that since he loved
[2:14:53] only the
[2:14:56] many is he therefore in a state of
[2:15:02] complacency awaiting the love of those
[2:15:04] who have not drawn n to
[2:15:08] him by no means is this
[2:15:12] so so he also declared in Romans
[2:15:16] 9:13 es have I
[2:15:19] hated and in verse 11 Spirit Bly calls
[2:15:22] out for the children not being
[2:15:26] born nether having done any
[2:15:30] good that the purpose of God according
[2:15:33] to
[2:15:36] election not of
[2:15:38] works but of him that
[2:15:41] call this
[2:15:43] love is elective
[2:15:47] love it is his love
[2:15:51] elect and his love for
[2:15:54] them is apart from Human
[2:15:58] Merit it says that the purpose of God
[2:16:02] stands
[2:16:07] in
[2:16:08] amen which is exactly opposite to
[2:16:14] works or anything that man has
[2:16:18] in he says something here
[2:16:21] and he see there are some people that
[2:16:22] couldn't figure out God's love for
[2:16:26] them and they thought that love meant no
[2:16:30] suffering they thought that love meant a
[2:16:33] baby with parental
[2:16:35] care but God said
[2:16:41] that and he says this the proof of his
[2:16:45] love is
[2:16:49] election you can read that in the
[2:16:51] simanian Church
[2:16:53] AG that the proof of his love is
[2:16:56] election that no matter what
[2:17:01] happened his love was proven
[2:17:07] truly by the fact that they were chosen
[2:17:10] unto
[2:17:11] [Music]
[2:17:16] salvation because God has chosen you to
[2:17:19] Salvation
[2:17:21] through sanctification of the
[2:17:24] spirit and belief of the
[2:17:28] truth he may commit you to death as he
[2:17:30] did with
[2:17:32] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[2:17:34] he did
[2:17:36] job that is his
[2:17:39] prerogative he is
[2:17:41] Sovereign that it isol with a
[2:17:45] purpose since if you're going through
[2:17:48] trials if you're going through
[2:17:49] Temptations
[2:17:51] and you know that you are the elect of
[2:17:54] God you go about it
[2:17:58] differently it does not matter how comes
[2:18:00] your
[2:18:01] way you know that your eternity is
[2:18:06] secure we sing this song I love him I
[2:18:10] love
[2:18:12] him
[2:18:18] because hallelujah amen now we can sing
[2:18:23] I Choose You I choose
[2:18:24] you because you fast
[2:18:30] CH so today I stand like Daniel with a
[2:18:35] purpose in my heart I choose not to
[2:18:39] defile
[2:18:42] myself amen God never went halfway with
[2:18:48] you he never went halfway with
[2:18:52] why are you going halfway
[2:19:01] with you went all the
[2:19:04] way as a matter of fact he went to the
[2:19:08] deepest part
[2:19:12] of you know what took him to the
[2:19:15] Cross you took him to the
[2:19:17] Cross do you know what kept him on the
[2:19:20] cross
[2:19:22] the
[2:19:23] moment they started spting on
[2:19:26] him I would have said enough is
[2:19:29] enough but he
[2:19:34] chose Hallelujah they put a th of crowns
[2:19:37] on his
[2:19:39] head ah this is as I
[2:19:42] can but he
[2:19:46] [Music]
[2:19:53] brother
[2:19:54] sister it was not three
[2:19:58] Nails two on the hands and one
[2:20:01] on
[2:20:05] that it was three words
[2:20:23] what did that make him
[2:20:25] do he chose
[2:20:30] me and at the end of it all he said it
[2:20:36] is
[2:20:43] finished
[2:20:45] amen praise the name of the
[2:20:47] Lord let us stand up on our feet
[2:20:54] Oh Glory to God
[2:20:56] hallelujah brother sister he
[2:21:00] chose God chose
[2:21:03] you do you understand what that
[2:21:07] means do you understand what that
[2:21:11] means brother Bram say something
[2:21:14] here I had a lot of quotations but just
[2:21:16] allow me
[2:21:22] he says
[2:21:27] this seem to have lost
[2:21:30] it you know many times people
[2:21:36] confuse and said that because I was
[2:21:41] predestinated I can do whatever I
[2:21:46] want you can't do whatever you want
[2:21:51] you are chosen for a
[2:21:53] purpose you are chosen for a
[2:21:58] reason there was this man by the name of
[2:22:00] of of there was this young man that was
[2:22:03] driving a car one
[2:22:06] time and he got to a certain place and
[2:22:08] the castle of broke
[2:22:10] down he tried to
[2:22:13] adjust few things there and there but
[2:22:15] nothing
[2:22:16] seems and then after some
[2:22:19] time there came a very a very
[2:22:23] classic you know a rich man stepped out
[2:22:27] of
[2:22:30] it a man that was well
[2:22:33] dressed came and asked him what's the
[2:22:35] problem my car can't seem to stop and he
[2:22:39] asked him can I have a
[2:22:41] look and he went and popped the trunk
[2:22:43] and
[2:22:45] start made a few
[2:22:47] adjustments and then know he told him
[2:22:49] why don't you start it
[2:22:51] and he started the car and it started he
[2:22:54] Reed the
[2:22:58] engine and he stepped the car he didn't
[2:23:02] even switch it off because he was
[2:23:05] fearing that it might go off
[2:23:07] again and stepped out and asked what did
[2:23:11] you
[2:23:11] do and this man said I cannot stand and
[2:23:16] watch any one of my creations
[2:23:21] not
[2:23:23] perform what I manufactured it to
[2:23:25] perform I didn't get
[2:23:32] [Music]
[2:23:35] it know who this man
[2:23:37] was this man was Henry
[2:23:43] Ford a vehicle
[2:23:46] manufacturer that saw one of his
[2:23:49] vehicles on the streets
[2:23:52] like and if such a rich
[2:23:54] man could have a lot of affection for
[2:23:57] his own
[2:23:59] work how about you and
[2:24:01] I Ephesians chter
[2:24:04] 3 for we are his
[2:24:08] workmanship Philippians chter
[2:24:11] one he that started at good
[2:24:15] work God will not sit
[2:24:18] down and watch you fail
[2:24:21] sit
[2:24:22] down you
[2:24:26] up Hallelujah brother Bram says
[2:24:29] this now
[2:24:33] notice Jesus didn't come to Calvary just
[2:24:36] for
[2:24:40] aard well I'll die up there and perhaps
[2:24:44] maybe somebody will feel sorry for
[2:24:46] me and come down and get saved
[2:24:50] no no no no no no no God don't run his
[2:24:54] office like
[2:24:55] that you don't run your office like
[2:24:58] that Jesus come for one specific
[2:25:01] purp that was to
[2:25:03] redeem those that God
[2:25:06] for would be
[2:25:08] redeemed now God is not willing that any
[2:25:11] should
[2:25:12] perish but that all would come to
[2:25:16] repent but in
[2:25:18] order to be God
[2:25:21] he had to
[2:25:25] know and he says in speaking of
[2:25:28] predestination the people sometimes Le
[2:25:32] to that God just predestinated
[2:25:35] you to push you through a little pipe or
[2:25:40] something that's not
[2:25:43] right destination looks back to for a
[2:25:45] knowledge

[2:27:22] you know beauty that is very
[2:27:26] superficial when he arrived in the
[2:27:30] ranch the same same thing that he
[2:27:33] found there were some ladies there
[2:27:36] some and they also dressed the same
[2:27:40] way with an
[2:27:42] intention that they were desing to get
[2:27:44] married to the

[2:27:51] we become an air to
[2:27:53] everything and I want to tell you
[2:27:56] something Jesus is also on a
[2:27:59] mission and this Mission he's looking
[2:28:02] for a particular
[2:28:04] thing that little piece of
[2:28:09] Eternity that is what he came to look
[2:28:12] for and if you're not a part of
[2:28:14] [Applause]
[2:28:15] that I'm sorry my brother my

[2:28:32] identifying
[2:28:33] you you need to make a
[2:28:36] choice and the young man came and that
[2:28:39] time they were holding a
[2:28:41] party he looked all
[2:28:43] around oh brother he looked around your
[2:28:51] how many of us
[2:28:53] here their parents do not even believe
[2:28:55] the
[2:28:57] message fathers do not even
[2:29:00] believe they do not have relatives
[2:29:05] that he chose
[2:29:09] you he left all the
[2:29:11] rest and went out of the party
[2:29:15] room and somewhere back
[2:29:18] there there was a kitchen
[2:29:21] and there was a little
[2:29:23] girl that was doing some
[2:29:28] clean and
[2:29:29] Jesus looking around all the
[2:29:32] churches looking around all the
[2:29:35] homes looking for a
[2:29:37] wife looking for a
[2:29:39] bride that is
[2:29:42] clean you see this guy was always about
[2:29:45] washing the pants and
[2:29:48] utensils Jesus is looking
[2:29:51] there such a

[2:30:21] here he gave the
[2:30:24] promise to the
[2:30:26] God but the
[2:30:29] man went
[2:30:32] back but you
[2:30:34] see he had already given his word to the
[2:30:39] God and after that man
[2:30:42] left it was the
[2:30:44] duty of the god to keep
[2:30:48] herself to prepare
[2:30:51] and make
[2:30:52] ready based on the
[2:30:55] choice that the man had
[2:30:58] made she was working day and
