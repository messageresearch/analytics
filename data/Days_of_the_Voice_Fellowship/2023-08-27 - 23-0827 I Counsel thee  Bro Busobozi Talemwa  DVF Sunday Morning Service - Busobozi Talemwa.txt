hearts with the knowledge that God is with us he has revived Us in Jesus name amen [Music] amen I want to invite everyone now to the scripture and then afterwards we are reading out of Psalms foreign [Music] I realized that we have never taken we've never officially welcomed the family of brother Peter genetics they have been here and then they went to iganga then they came back then they went back you passed two or three Sundays I've been forgetting to mention Services can you come up here with your family okay while they are coming I want to also his brother Patrick here already yeah some a brother directed him here so you're welcome is she here yet maybe she got lost in the way or you are the one God bless you Sister Dina oh dear oh dear but you're welcome you're welcome God bless you come on sister dinner had sister killed as well God bless you Amen brother Justice where's brother Justice God bless you you're all welcome God so this is the family brother Peter and her family is not seeing you brother Peter you're hiding come this side I know we have also our online congregation that sometimes things go on and they don't understand what we're talking about brother Peter's family they have both been my children we were with Agnes in Ethiopia for a while agonists about a while actually a few years I moved back down to Uganda now come away Uganda brother Peter is uh he is my biological brother but uh most of the time I spent with him I was his father and he was my son and so Agnes is I think a cousin to my wife as well again God gave them to us as our children and then eventually our children became our children when they got married [Music] so it's a blessing to get married and so God has given them two beautiful children and we're happy to have them back again in the church they joined me now they are Saturday foreign amen Amina so we are we are going to um Psalms 1. we are reading only three verses and then we shall be seated today blessed is the man that walketh not in the Council of the ungodly not standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of this cornful foreign and it shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his live also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosperous shall do what shall prosper amen may God bless you please be seated come around we are thankful to God to this young man brother Dixon Dixon he travels every weekend from Ginger but the weekend yeah he's currently uh continuing with these studies to be able to be with us here in the services amen amen [Applause] she's in um she went back home for holidays yes so I pray that God will give her grace and utterance as she is now probably going to be able to share her Newfound Faith with her family is a pastor and she has just received the message I think two Sundays ago get excited with this message let us pray that she will be a light amen so this morning I'm having a thought which says I cancel thee Angie I canceled I cancel there I don't know whether that is the perfect interpretation if it is not yeah yeah maybe I can't I'm against Uber okay I realize here in Psalms it says okay let me go a little bit ahead of myself and read with you just that portion of Revelation 3. we see what it says Revelation 3 um read verses uh 18. because but I always Endeavor to maybe preach for one hour our Prophet advised us preachers to preach for at least 40 minutes so because after 40 minutes 45 minutes some concentration people's concentration goes down sometimes we lose time and we can even preach for two hours we don't even realize the preacher preached for two hours foreign means uh to give advice to someone or give professional help and advice to someone to resolve some personal or psychological problems you know it can also mean to recommend a cause of action now in the Book of Psalms chapter 1 where we have read it it speaks of the ungodly and he talks about the Council of the ungodly and the Bible says the man that does not work in the Council of the argumentative he even said the man that does not stand in the way of Sinners but he said but his law is the light augmented his Delights is in the law of the Lord in the law of the Lord he meditates both his fruit in his season now I wanted to realize here this is not the season of the man this is the season [Music] the problem is many of us don't wait for God is Susan want our season for things to happen when we want them to happen to be together and when it doesn't happen when we won we begin grumbling We Begin complaining We Begin memory God does not like that God loves those that are planted in him wait for the season of God you remember when God found that tree it was not the season for it to bear fruit you understand he wanted the fruit it was his season but not the season of the tree so what did he do when he didn't find fruit there and there yeah he said from today you will no one will ever eat of you I want fruit but if we are planted in Christ amen we must bear fruit in his sisters but the problem is we will over Mama over delayed foreign they don't do it with all their hearts I knew you would be seated here so what are you doing right now let your heart be here I am preaching let me preach with all my heart to all your problems be outside to be able to receive the full blessings [Music] and his season will come for you to pay a fruit foreign not some of the things he does see see whatsoever he does not your neighbor whatsoever let me ask you a question let us be sincere now for just a moment do all the things you do prosperity be sincere with yourself which Council are you receiving the Bible says blessed is so it will suffice to say the temperature we do sometimes don't prosperity because we are not working according to the cancer of God we are working according to the cancer of the UN God I want to read them for you a few maybe the brother can project them out of Psalms just do it quickly and go through them though it's this is it's already in the sums you could open it the wicked in his pride does persecute the poor let them be taken in the devil says that they have imagined for the wicked boasteth of his heart is desire and blesses the confessions whom the Lord abhorth the wicked through the pride of his continents will not seek after God and is not in all and God is not in all his thoughts Psalms 10 too foreign he says he will not seek after God you know God is not in all his thoughts I wanted to remember the things I've been doing this week is you know in Romans it says because they did not retain God in their minds God gave them to vile affections to do those things which are hands people do wrong things because they don't retain God in there because they don't seek after God and what they did they sick or they burst according to their heart is say it within my heart that there is no fear of God before his eyes for he fluttereth himself in all in his own eyes until his iniquity be found to be hateful the worlds of his mouth are iniquity and deceit the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he has left off to be wise and and to do good now this is from verse one to three movies [Music] praise the name of the Lord the Bible says no fear of God before his eyes fear the church other people instead of God how will they see how many times have you said that will God see me but many times people don't have this wicked they don't have the fear of God for he flood as himself in his own eyes okay oh no I'm good I'm rich there's nothing I need there is something um because you feel you don't need it foreign [Music] foreign [Music] may God help us according to the Council of the weekend no one will ever advise you to stop following the word when he is not using sweet words no one will give you a cancer that is against the world when his cancer doesn't sound sweet but the Bible says here is their end he says Lord may you destroy them let them fall I have not sat with vain persons neither will I go in with in with decemblers I have hated the congregation of evil doers and will not sit with the weekend foreign [Music] [Music] people they come and they want to make us feel guilty vegetables oh you've made sister you made women not attractive and they want to make us feel as if we are preaching wrong teaching but related to be a triple leadership if the world makes them not attractive that's the word I am I'm Desiring why it is the Council of God younger men whatever the word tells you to do I don't care whether it sounds non-practical I don't care whether it sounds unrealistic is the word of God and watch that word of God I'm bringing forth It's a season of God Hallelujah the word of God is not popular did you know that What God Says is not popular politically correct but the word of God is always true the Bible says let Heaven and Earth pass away shall never pass away I don't care who it is even sometimes your parents they tell you to do everything but the Bible says not in the council [Music] foreign he never disappointed he cannot disappoint that someone like when you are every appointment he met with the child take account he fulfills it never left I said he's never late he always comes and shows up never because the time no one expected one even you yourself for his word I said he said he is the word of God can I pronounce it upon you you are blessed I don't need a man tell me I am blessed no as long as I follow the counselves and the Bible says whatsoever you do your natural color if you take the cancer of God hallelujah if you do a business God shall give you the money if you go for Education everything is what God Said in his words foreign the ungodly have their own Council they receive their councils in the bus when they're drinking alcohol maybe when they're eating their pork and alcohol oh they're drinking malware then they begin walking in that kind of thing so you can't find a man of God a woman of God that's the seat of this you see you find them having their castles in the process you know what a brother is you know you find them in shrines hey yeah let me talk about broth in a little bit I don't know it sounds large a brothel is a house of prostitutes yes and you find a brother who has a business who paid who pays his teeth very well by the way if you don't pay your teeth you are not working according to the cancer of God that's the truth but even if you pay your tithesis the time you spent with that prostitute some people come out I remember value and they say someone advised me I should do this and whoever advised them was a prostitute God have mercy what you're doing come on shrines you find them going to shrines I hope Believers don't do that because you find a believer I hope that never gets wrong you foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign hmm and they'll tell them sacrifice a child do this do that do this and then people will do that some others they sit in the Council of the room Among Us you know let me tell you rumors or rumor mongers it's a very bad Spirit some people are very good at it and these days it used to be only women [Music] if you were a man or a boy and you are doing room Among Us that's a bad Spirit movie and now no one is pointing to another one if you know you are you've been rumor mongering secrets but he that is of a faithful Spirits considers the matter is [Music] secrets foreign foreign Uganda foreign Thou shalt make thy wall [Music] um it's not even out there among people who don't know our God always from the word of God foreign and an imaginative counselors there is safety that's why I'm telling you this is very wise for you to find Council I told you that I'm speaking to you as a pastor it is prudent for you to find cancer in important matters [Music] in marriage matters financial matters if you're seeking a job you know if you are you know in going to school education Life as a whole very important you need to find ways you need to get that Council from the right office the problem that we have heard now there is in many churches and people find the council in the wrong office did you know that an office has an anointing foreign he he was able to give them wise cancer because of the anointing of the office upon him go to the right office when you are seeking cancer in important matters in your life [Music] God has the office of a pastor and I'll read you quotes that have blessed my life from the message respects he says if you can't respect the man I cannot go to that person I would rather go to Brothers I I even he even did this therefore I don't respect him but he says here if you can't respect the man respect the office he holds in God that is exactly right respect himself your pastor always respect himself I'll just talk about him run him down ridicule him how is that Pastor ever going to do anything for you I can't do it you don't he says I don't set this churches of sin now to love your bastard you've got to know that he's a human being for cancer foreign on my situation and I believe whatever he will say will be of God and I'll tell you what many people when they're going to get into marriages they don't take their pastors cancers and did you know that especially around that time to get married the pastor will tell you things if you don't listen to him you will see those things happening always Mina foreign you support the cause foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] every one of these ministers foreign [Music] the name of the Lord my mother God has given me the opportunity to Pastor my mother listen hear me now God has given me opening to Pastor my mother so when she comes to me I have to know how is she coming it's a very difficult position to be in your bed I have to know she's now coming as my mother she's now coming as a sheep needing cancer then I'm not going to speak to her others [Music] I believe three foreign David had died and Solomon his son took over sins and Solomon did a big mistress to remind in accordance Solomon married many wives so the man did I was together with all the consumers with about a thousand of them but here was the problem mad at these women from the heat types and all those other tribes that God told the Believers not to marry from Solomon married these women overpowered him and they began to teach him the ways [Applause] foreign only one king or One Tribe rather one tries that is the time of Judah in Jerusalem why because of my servant David why because David followed the cancer of God so if you follow the curse of God you are securing Prosperity can you imagine that some of you brother sisters you need to start breaking cycles that have been in your family sometimes you carry something from your father from his father something was done in the past I mean it gets carried over to you because of someone need to make decisions foreign Solomon was blessed um when Solomon came on the sins I'm not going to let you build my temples because you have too much blood on your hands listen to me David was blessed and the blessing that when God shows that you are blessed here is what proves it says the blessing of God um not the richest today and tomorrow fell in things he found already made things and God received him and allowed him to build the temples then he went to serving other gods [Music] I still remember what they promised imagine someone coming in your blessings and walking in you need the way he wants [Music] that's what God does God wants to make sure you see it I could feel the pain when Solomon had that he quickly rushed to kill his servant I think he was name is but if God has said he is saying and you could not kill him and later on Solomon died a man enough and now Katie after he has died I want us to read what happened we see what how cancer is very important don't enter into anything important without cancer [Music] in First Kings chapter 12. because praise the name of the Lord I might have mixed up the names there but butham is the son of Solomon I knew I'd mix it up now listen verse one it says I'm going to shake him for all Israel will come to check him to make him King is now his father Solomon is dead so he now is going to be made praise the name of the Lord and it came to pass when jeroboam the son of nibat who was yet in Egypt had it of it he was fled from the presence of the King Solomon and jeroboam dwelt in Egypt right but they went and called him and jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came and spoke unto rehoboam saying thy father made our your Grievous now there are for make thou the Grievous service of thy father and his heavy yoke which he put Upon Us lighter and we will serve thee unto them depart yet for three days then come again to me and the people Departed and the King robot robot with the old man that stood before Solomon his father while he yet lived and said how do you advise that I may answer these people [Music] is spoken to him saying if thou would be a servant unto these people this day and will serve them and answer them and speak
