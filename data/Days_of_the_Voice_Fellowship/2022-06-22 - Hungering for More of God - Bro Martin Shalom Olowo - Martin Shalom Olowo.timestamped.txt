[28:53] us
[28:56] amen
[29:11] one brother gave a prophecy and then
[29:12] another one interprets
[29:16] or when prophecy is given
[29:23] but when the word is preached
[29:37] and this evening i want to talk i'm
[29:39] going to share
[29:41] about hungering for more of god
[29:51] hungering for god

[30:08] from his own lips
[30:13] it says that blessing and they wish to
[30:18] hunger and thrust after righteousness
