[55:08] mission
[55:10] report. Before I do that, I just want to

[55:27] and you know, the God the Lord that used
[55:29] the brothers to minister to
[55:33] you. Um I have a long list of them
[55:37] here. I tell you, people have been
[55:39] following the
[55:43] Even this morning, a brother from
[55:45] Australia told me he enjoyed the
[55:47] services and he specifically mentioned
[55:49] one of the
[55:53] brothers, a brother from Kenya. I heard
[55:56] from
[55:56] him from Kenya and I think from some
[56:00] other
[56:01] country they was specifically mentioning
[56:03] a few
[56:05] ministers that were a blessing to them.
[56:09] So thankful to hear that.
[56:11] Amen. And uh the brothers had preached
[56:15] brother
[56:15] Martin
[56:17] Julius
[56:20] Polin brother
[56:24] brother Shalom Shalom brother
[56:26] Amram was there were all these brothers
[56:28] we were on the pull pit.
[56:31] Brother we want to appreciate each and
[56:34] every one of
[56:35] them. Amen.
[56:38] You know, they kept the pull pit
[56:40] busy and they kept your heart
[56:44] fed and we we certainly appreciate
[56:47] God. But there are also others who have
[56:49] been doing a lot of work behind the
[56:52] scenes in the home
[56:54] sales, the homeale
[56:57] leaders. You know, brother is
[57:00] specifically doing a good work in his
[57:04] home. Where is brother? Is he

[57:29] in that's really wonderful. you know,
[57:32] they turning home sales into
[57:35] um roadside evangelism.
[57:40] And I think friends, there there's no
[57:41] better way to preach the gospel,
[57:45] especially in places like our country
[57:47] here where we have the freedom and the
[57:49] liberty to do
[57:51] that and people can suffer us to do
[57:55] it. Really appreciate it. Amen. Um, you
[57:59] know, I was, you know, in Australia,
[58:01] they need to get a license to preach on
[58:02] the
[58:05] street. Brothers, you can still do it
[58:08] here without a
[58:10] license. Let us do it. Uh, the deacons,
[58:14] I appreciate
[58:15] you. Brother, you know, brother, brother
[58:17] Martin, God bless you. Um and the

[58:54] department, you know, all these people
[58:56] have been by the faithfully at their
[58:58] post of
[59:00] duty. Sometimes people out there think
[59:02] that DVF is a very huge
[59:06] church. We are very simple
[59:09] congregation but with a committed young
[59:13] people really want to serve the Lord. So
[59:16] the media department, we appreciate you
[59:17] so much.

[59:25] leaders. I mean the the reports have

[59:34] next weekend we'll deal with that but we
[59:36] I believe we going to buy our
[59:41] land you know it many things might come
[59:44] in the way to try and obstruct and
[59:46] hinder
[59:50] But there is one thing that we should
[59:52] do. We should remain
[59:55] consistent in our burden and
[59:58] vision. The Lord shall accomplish
[1:00:01] it. And I specifically also want to
[1:00:03] appreciate the prayer
[1:00:06] group. There's a group here of uh
[1:00:08] sisters and brothers that really
[1:00:11] pray at every uh every day 3:00 a.m. in
[1:00:15] the morning.

[1:00:20] heard them specifically mention my name
[1:00:22] and I really appreciate
[1:00:24] that. All those that have been praying.

[1:00:41] long and I want to thank the song leader
[1:00:43] for keeping time. God bless you.

[1:01:05] Amen. How many would love to have
[1:01:10] that? Amen. Amen. Wow. So, uh, brother
[1:01:14] brother Isaac, brother Marvin, I'm going
[1:01:15] to go right quick through
[1:01:18] it. I'll appreciate that, uh, you give
[1:01:21] me the slides as I mentioned
[1:01:25] them. Uh, brother Marvin, if you could
[1:01:27] give me slide
[1:01:30] two. So, right here that we we we we
[1:01:34] when we left, we landed in
[1:01:38] Qatar and this is the church in Katar.
[1:01:44] I was there not for
[1:01:46] long. It was not part of uh my my stop.
[1:01:51] It was not my part of my planned
[1:01:56] stop, but uh the Lord arranged it for
[1:01:59] us because I was there for more than 21
[1:02:04] hours. And usually you would need a visa
[1:02:07] for Ugandans to enter a pre um a visa
[1:02:09] that you have applied before you you go
[1:02:16] through. I told them look I am just go
[1:02:19] going another
[1:02:21] place and I'm a minister of the gospel.
[1:02:25] The man looked at me, no doubt he's a
[1:02:28] Muslim, looked at me, said, "Okay, you
[1:02:31] are supposed to have a
[1:02:32] visa, but let me go and and see what my
[1:02:35] superiors
[1:02:37] will." And so, they gave me um a transit
[1:02:42] visa right
[1:02:44] away, which to me, I I feel that I felt
[1:02:47] that the Lord had a purpose for it.
[1:02:51] I uh went to the hotel and I did not
[1:02:53] know that there were any believers in
[1:02:54] the
[1:02:56] country. And so uh later on I I was led
[1:03:00] of the Holy Spirit to call a friend of
[1:03:02] mine, a
[1:03:04] brother, brother Ken in Nairobi. And I
[1:03:09] told him, hey, you know, I'm in Kata. He
[1:03:11] said, oh, you
[1:03:13] in believers in I said, for real? So you
[1:03:17] shared the
[1:03:18] contacts of a Kenyan brother. The Kenyan
[1:03:21] brother was he was working there but at
[1:03:23] the time he was in in
[1:03:28] Nairobi. He connected me with other
[1:03:31] believers believer connected me with the
[1:03:34] pastor. And if you give me the uh the
[1:03:38] next slide,
[1:03:41] you can see that that's the the
[1:03:42] lighthouse there.
[1:03:47] It's called end time message believers.

[1:03:53] just wanted to show that this is a
[1:03:55] lighthouse in the middle of the Ishima.
[1:03:58] Lighthouse.
[1:04:07] There is a message church. Amen. Give me
[1:04:09] the next slide, brother.
[1:04:12] These are some of the brothers we are
[1:04:13] able to meet and fellowship
[1:04:16] with and others, sisters that we we
[1:04:19] don't I I could not put all the pictures
[1:04:21] for you really.
[1:04:24] The one next to me
[1:04:26] there on the other side is uh the
[1:04:29] pastor, brother
[1:04:32] Dandy and they were so happy to meet
[1:04:34] with me and very gracious and we shared
[1:04:37] a meal
[1:04:38] there had a few testimonies and talked
[1:04:41] about the Lord and speaking the same
[1:04:44] language of the
[1:04:45] message and uh and but believers of this
[1:04:49] message and later on the pastor you know
[1:04:52] dropped me off at
[1:04:55] airport. Um, and then we um, uh, Can you
[1:05:00] give me the next slide? Number
[1:05:02] five. All right. You see where is for
[1:05:05] those of you who don't have your
[1:05:07] geography very
[1:05:10] well. Right there in the Middle East.
[1:05:15] You see that small red dot there.
[1:05:20] So from there I flew to uh
[1:05:23] Brisbane Brisbane. Next slide, brother.
[1:05:29] Um and
[1:05:30] um number seven.
[1:05:35] Next slide, brother.
[1:05:37] Okay. Amen. On board the
[1:05:41] aircraft that was a 14-hour
[1:05:45] flight from Qatar to Brisbane in
[1:05:47] Australia. Brisbane, Australia. I met
[1:05:50] this young
[1:05:51] lady. Her name is Joy. Joy. She was
[1:05:54] seated next to my
[1:05:57] seat. So we started talking. Where is
[1:06:00] she going? What is she going to
[1:06:02] do? Oh, she's a student coming from
[1:06:05] Kenya going to Australia to
[1:06:06] study and so I started you know also. So
[1:06:10] who are you? I'm a
[1:06:12] pastor in Australia. Australia. You have
[1:06:15] churches? Yes. Oh yes, we have churches
[1:06:18] all over the
[1:06:19] world. Oh, I love this
[1:06:21] message. We we are identified with
[1:06:24] believers all over the
[1:06:27] world and um you know, so she it was her
[1:06:31] first time to
[1:06:32] fly. It was her first time to be at any
[1:06:36] airport. She did not know how to do
[1:06:38] things. I tried to help her, you know,
[1:06:41] and then finally we arrived and brother
[1:06:45] Gary was right there waiting for
[1:06:47] me. And so I introduced her to
[1:06:51] him. She was supposed to come to the
[1:06:53] meetings but it was a distance. She
[1:06:55] wasn't able to
[1:06:58] come in touch and I believe that that
[1:07:01] encounter will not leave her the same.
[1:07:06] So um I believe that she'll receive this
[1:07:09] message.
[1:07:11] All right. So then give me the next
[1:07:13] slide. So these are some of the pictures
[1:07:16] in

[1:08:24] burden to minister to young

[1:08:46] congregation. Next slide, brother.

[1:09:08] want to say greetings from brother Gary
[1:09:09] Walker's family.
[1:09:13] And when I say family, it's extended
[1:09:15] family.
[1:09:16] [Music]
[1:09:18] Um you know um there's only one sister
[1:09:21] missing
[1:09:22] here who is the wife of the son of
[1:09:25] brother Gary right now
[1:09:29] the brother who is behind
[1:09:30] me his name is brother Michael if I've
[1:09:32] not
[1:09:34] got so uh the rest are all grandchildren
[1:09:37] of brother Gary
[1:09:41] so that that this picture was taken um
[1:09:44] uh on the uh on The last night as they
[1:09:47] were dismissing
[1:09:51] me, it was a really good time we had
[1:09:54] with very lovely people. You know, I
[1:09:58] told the believers there in
[1:10:00] Brisbane that um you are genuine
[1:10:05] believers. The reason I told them
[1:10:07] that is because you know you find that
[1:10:10] these people are very busy.
[1:10:13] They work they they you know every one
[1:10:16] of them is
[1:10:17] employed and they work some of them
[1:10:20] late
[1:10:22] let you know either they're engineers or
[1:10:25] you know some this worker
[1:10:28] that they're very
[1:10:30] busy and for sure to serve God
[1:10:34] there you need to be really knowing what
[1:10:37] you
[1:10:38] believe you need to be genuine you need
[1:10:41] to be committed
[1:10:44] It is impossible to serve
[1:10:47] God with the way I know some of
[1:10:49] you. If you live there, you may no
[1:10:53] longer come to
[1:10:54] church. Why? Because some of you when
[1:10:57] you get a
[1:10:58] job, it becomes your
[1:11:01] God. You forget about church. Church
[1:11:05] becomes a
[1:11:05] burden. And you know, even some can't
[1:11:09] even think about going to church in
[1:11:10] during midweek.
[1:11:14] But these people they drive long
[1:11:16] distances they come from
[1:11:18] work. There is a particular brother I
[1:11:20] don't know his name but I specifically
[1:11:22] saw
[1:11:23] him every midweek
[1:11:26] service he was dressed in uh in um in in
[1:11:30] his
[1:11:32] overall very
[1:11:33] dirty but because he has to be at
[1:11:37] church he will always come and be in the
[1:11:40] midweek side.
[1:11:43] I love it. I I didn't talk about it, but
[1:11:45] I'm talking about it here because I was
[1:11:48] really touched by
[1:11:51] that. They are not
[1:11:53] poor. They have basic needs. Whatever
[1:11:56] they
[1:11:58] need, but they are coming to
[1:12:00] church. Some of us come to church only
[1:12:03] when we want to go to bless
[1:12:06] us. When he blesses you, you are too
[1:12:09] busy for God.
[1:12:12] Some I've heard even someone say ah let
[1:12:14] the ones who don't have anything to do
[1:12:15] going to church all the
[1:12:20] time to you who thinks like that. If you
[1:12:24] go to Australia you will stop going to
[1:12:28] church. It is a shame. These people are
[1:12:32] really
[1:12:33] genuine. I was touched. I was I thought
[1:12:37] I want to minister to them but they
[1:12:38] minister to me.
[1:12:41] But because they preached to
[1:12:43] me their life, I was able to
[1:12:46] see something that I could bring back
[1:12:50] home. So, brethren, we should be more
[1:12:55] serious. You know, brother Bam says that
[1:12:58] money can be a
[1:13:01] snare not only to those who have
[1:13:03] it, but also to those who don't have it.
[1:13:07] So you you be busy looking for
[1:13:10] money. You don't have time for God. Or
[1:13:13] you don't have money at all. You say I'm
[1:13:16] broke. I can't
[1:13:18] even. So really both sides. Only the
[1:13:22] people who know their
[1:13:24] God will really go to
[1:13:27] fellowship. So we don't come to
[1:13:29] fellowship because we are poor. We
[1:13:32] should come to fellowship because we
[1:13:35] love the Lord.
[1:13:36] We should not come to fellowship because
[1:13:38] we have money. We should come to
[1:13:40] fellowship because we love the
[1:13:43] Lord. Amen. And I I was really blessed
[1:13:46] by those brothers. They are genuine. I
[1:13:48] told them that you are genuine
[1:13:50] believers.
[1:13:52] And I and I told the the immigrants, the
[1:13:54] brothers that are especially African
[1:13:57] brothers, I said that look, you you come
[1:14:00] here when you're on
[1:14:02] fire and then when you arrive here, the
[1:14:05] fire dies. What happened is because life
[1:14:08] became softer and things became better.
[1:14:12] So really you should all of us we should
[1:14:14] take an
[1:14:15] inventory of our life. When are you on
[1:14:18] fire for God? when you have something in
[1:14:20] the
[1:14:21] pocket or when you have
[1:14:23] nothing. And these people don't have
[1:14:25] very much but they have what they need.
[1:14:29] But I noticed
[1:14:31] something. People are genuinely serving
[1:14:33] the
[1:14:35] Lord. So you should also we should also
[1:14:38] genuinely serve the
[1:14:41] Lord. You should have 100% amen on
[1:14:45] that. Amen. God bless you.
[1:14:49] 12. Number 12. So that right there in
[1:14:51] Brisbane, that's right at the red spot.
[1:14:54] That is Brisbane.
[1:14:57] That is where I was with brother Gary
[1:15:00] and his
[1:15:01] church. We had a total of six services
[1:15:07] in Brisbane. Brisbane. So on to uh the
[1:15:10] next stop. Go to the next
[1:15:14] slide. And then uh that is uh from
[1:15:16] Brisbane we traveled by air 2 hours and
[1:15:19] 30 minute
[1:15:21] flight to Melbourne
[1:15:24] and this is another
[1:15:26] city another place
[1:15:30] uh in Australia Australia. The next
[1:15:33] slide there you will see uh you know
[1:15:37] these are men of God
[1:15:41] there. Uh next to me is the pastor of
[1:15:44] the church in in Melbourne.
[1:15:49] Um
[1:15:51] brother is Ghanian by
[1:15:55] origin but uh he's more Australian than
[1:15:58] he is African.
[1:16:02] I mean he's been there for more than 30
[1:16:05] years. And uh so really he's they're
[1:16:08] doing a a good work
[1:16:09] there. And I think their church is
[1:16:11] really the biggest in
[1:16:13] Australia. Australia. Right next to him
[1:16:16] is a brother Charles.
[1:16:19] He's um also originally from Zambia.
[1:16:23] There's a professor in one of the
[1:16:26] universities. He's a deacon in the
[1:16:29] church. Next is brother
[1:16:32] Keer. Now I've met good brothers, lovely
[1:16:37] brothers, but this brother is special.
[1:16:41] He has a special
[1:16:43] testimony. I mean, I got to know more
[1:16:45] about him because I was staying at their
[1:16:48] house. His wife is a Sunday school
[1:16:51] teacher Sunday school. I linked her up
[1:16:53] with one of the sisters
[1:16:55] here Sunday
[1:16:57] school and they're very lovely couple,
[1:17:00] very
[1:17:01] lovely. And I know brother Keer might
[1:17:03] might actually be following the service
[1:17:04] right now.
[1:17:08] uh you know he has I told him I would
[1:17:10] like you to come when your pastor is
[1:17:11] coming so you can share your
[1:17:15] testimony. I know it would be a
[1:17:16] blessing. He's a he's um a deacon there
[1:17:19] in the
[1:17:21] church. Next
[1:17:23] slide. Everywhere I went
[1:17:26] uh I noticed I found people that either
[1:17:29] knew of us or had met us.
[1:17:32] [Music]
[1:17:34] So when I arrived here, I was shocked to
[1:17:37] see that young
[1:17:39] man right there and next to me on the
[1:17:43] left, on the
[1:17:44] right, his name is
[1:17:47] Brotheras. This young man was with us in
[1:17:49] Ethiopia for about a year and a
[1:17:52] half and now they married and moved to
[1:17:55] Australia
[1:17:57] with so it was a wonderful
[1:18:02] reunion and this brother is um a lovely
[1:18:06] brother remember pastor Manda who
[1:18:08] minister to
[1:18:10] us he's very close with him
[1:18:13] and and so wonderful it was wonderful to
[1:18:16] meet people that know of
[1:18:20] us and people that uh somehow the bride
[1:18:23] is connected all over the
[1:18:25] world. Number
[1:18:28] 16 right there uh the some some of the
[1:18:31] brothers. I mean I can talk a lot about
[1:18:34] each of these
[1:18:36] brothers time of fellowship we
[1:18:39] spent but one thing to highlight in
[1:18:44] Melbourne I met somebody
[1:18:47] that was actually at my wedding in
[1:18:52] 2013. So when I was sharing the
[1:18:54] testimony, my
[1:18:56] testimony on a Friday service, I
[1:18:59] projected uh uh the my wedding
[1:19:03] picture. So this sister came up late and
[1:19:06] said, "But I when I saw you, you looked
[1:19:09] [Music]
[1:19:11] familiar, but when I saw the wedding
[1:19:13] picture, I knew I know you.
[1:19:17] Can you give me the next slide? That's a
[1:19:19] sister right there. And uh this is her
[1:19:23] husband. At the time she was living in
[1:19:25] the in Washington, I believe.
[1:19:30] But now she moved to Australia when she
[1:19:32] got married to this
[1:19:34] brother. So it was a wonderful reunion
[1:19:36] after how many years? 12
[1:19:40] years. I was amazed.
[1:19:44] her father is um one I mean her
[1:19:46] husband's father is one of the ministers
[1:19:48] in the church
[1:19:51] there in Melbourne Melbourne. So next
[1:19:54] slide. So we had about three we had
[1:19:57] three services in
[1:19:59] Melbourne. Uh that family told me send
[1:20:02] greetings. So I said okay I'll put you
[1:20:03] on the
[1:20:08] screen. They are from originally from
[1:20:10] the Congo.
[1:20:13] In Australia there's a it's a really a
[1:20:16] mixed multitude because a lot of races
[1:20:20] because people most of them are
[1:20:21] immigrants.
[1:20:26] Australia. Most of the population there
[1:20:28] is
[1:20:32] immigrants from Europe, from Africa,
[1:20:34] Asia, from
[1:20:36] Asia. And that's brother Keer and his
[1:20:40] wife. And uh we really had they took
[1:20:43] good care of me. So when you're praying,
[1:20:46] remember brother Keer and his
[1:20:49] wife. Amen. and uh give me the next
[1:20:53] slide. Uh there's more I can talk about
[1:20:55] each picture but I don't want to take
[1:20:57] all the time.
[1:21:02] See I went from Melbourne I went back to
[1:21:07] Brisbane and then I flew from Brisbane.
[1:21:10] Now this is the
[1:21:12] east the east
[1:21:16] coast all the way to the west
[1:21:19] coast in path it's 5 hours 15
[1:21:25] minutes I was amazed you know this is a
[1:21:28] large land
[1:21:31] mass you know Uganda can fit into the
[1:21:34] country of Australia 33 times
[1:21:39] Uganda
[1:21:41] Australia. Yeah. If you're going to be
[1:21:44] traveling by road, that's a journey of 4
[1:21:46] to 7
[1:21:51] hours. But there believers almost
[1:21:56] everywhere. Why am I saying these
[1:21:58] things? We're always saying there are
[1:22:00] people almost
[1:22:03] everywhere. I want you to see
[1:22:06] indeed. There are people everywhere that
[1:22:10] believe this end time
[1:22:11] message. Amen. People who stand for the
[1:22:14] Lord the way we do.
[1:22:18] So right here in um in uh Path
[1:22:23] is uh the church called Spoken Word
[1:22:25] Fellowship.
[1:22:26] Next spoken word Fellowship. Um the
[1:22:29] that's uh the pastor there is um uh a a
[1:22:34] wonderful brother that we spend a lot of
[1:22:36] time with.
[1:22:39] Give me the next
[1:22:41] slide. This is the founder of the
[1:22:44] work. Uh his name is brother brother
[1:22:48] Cloud Porter. Cloud. He started the
[1:22:52] church in the 1980s after he moved in
[1:22:54] this
[1:22:57] place and u he passed away I think a few
[1:23:01] years
[1:23:02] ago. Give me the next
[1:23:04] slide. Now the pastor of that place is
[1:23:07] this
[1:23:09] brother Michael
[1:23:13] from Zimbabwe
[1:23:14] originally Zimbabwe. This man moved to a
[1:23:19] he had been from Zimbabwe he went to
[1:23:21] work I think in some other country
[1:23:25] south and from there he went to
[1:23:29] Australia Australia in Path. Little did
[1:23:33] he know he was going to become the
[1:23:35] pastor of the church in
[1:23:38] part. So he he just fell into something
[1:23:41] he never prepared
[1:23:43] himself. But the Lord had prepared him
[1:23:46] for and he's been a pastor I think a few
[1:23:50] maybe a decade or
[1:23:54] so. Uh he's a really wonderful
[1:23:58] brother and u and wonderful spirited
[1:24:02] brother and uh we appreciated spending
[1:24:05] time with
[1:24:07] them wife and
[1:24:09] family. We stayed at their house. I mean
[1:24:13] he's still working very
[1:24:15] busy and uh but still having to find
[1:24:17] time for
[1:24:19] ministry
[1:24:21] family you know it's serving God is a
[1:24:26] sacrifice no matter where you are
[1:24:28] serving God is a
[1:24:31] sacrifice even here in
[1:24:33] Africa the sacrifices might be different
[1:24:36] in one way the
[1:24:38] other but it is a sacrifice
[1:24:42] and brother Michael I appreciated
[1:24:44] him and they are actually trying to
[1:24:47] purchase a a property of their own
[1:24:51] now and remember them in
[1:24:54] prayer. He's a brother that I really uh
[1:24:57] I mean like um I I I very much connected
[1:25:04] with in the in the future we will have
[1:25:06] him come.
[1:25:09] I'm sure he will be an immense blessing
[1:25:10] to
[1:25:12] us. Uh if you give me the next
[1:25:16] slide, now this is a
[1:25:19] testimony when we were going around with
[1:25:22] brother
[1:25:24] Michael. Um you know just moving around
[1:25:27] the
[1:25:28] park and you know he was showing me
[1:25:32] places. Uh we reached a certain place
[1:25:34] and we found this young man.
[1:25:38] He had a book in his
[1:25:40] hand but I felt as we were
[1:25:43] walking I felt let me ask him. So I said
[1:25:48] can I greet? He said yeah there you have
[1:25:51] to ask someone can I
[1:25:52] [Music]
[1:25:53] greet otherwise you are encroaching in a
[1:25:56] territory that is not
[1:25:59] yours. So I remember that I was
[1:26:01] encroaching in after contacting him.
[1:26:07] Anyway, here in Africa, everybody say,
[1:26:10] "Hey, from Africa, you can greet
[1:26:12] anybody. How are you?" Even when you
[1:26:13] have never seen them. So, well, he said,
[1:26:16] "Yeah, how are you?" Say, "I'm fine."
[1:26:18] What's your name? My name is Your name.
[1:26:20] Oh, is this a Bible? He said, "Yes." I
[1:26:23] said, "Ah, okay." Um, I said, "Are you a
[1:26:26] Christian?" He said, "Yes." I said, "I'd
[1:26:28] like to invite you to
[1:26:30] church." Sure, I would like to come.
[1:26:33] And so um long story short, he came to
[1:26:37] church that Sunday
[1:26:38] morning. I don't remember was it a
[1:26:40] Sunday morning or one of the services he
[1:26:44] actually
[1:26:45] came and I
[1:26:47] preached and I
[1:26:49] preached and preached and one of the
[1:26:53] things I was talking about was the
[1:26:55] godhead and then I talked about the
[1:26:57] serpent seat.
[1:26:59] So he said these words. He said,
[1:27:02] "Pastor, you are preaching. You had
[1:27:04] everything
[1:27:06] and it were it were like as if in the
[1:27:10] things you were the software you were
[1:27:12] downloading to
[1:27:20] me and I also had the same software in
[1:27:26] me and it kept on
[1:27:28] connecting and I kept on saying
[1:27:30] amen. And then he said and there is some
[1:27:34] other direction you
[1:27:36] take. And then I realized that
[1:27:40] software is not upgraded in my
[1:27:44] system. But you could clearly
[1:27:47] see it is an upgrade of the software I
[1:27:54] have. And he said pastor I want to meet
[1:27:56] you so I can talk more. I can upgrade my
[1:28:02] software. I'm sure he was talking about
[1:28:04] the serpent
[1:28:06] seed. Besides, you preach. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:08] Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:28:12] Amen. I see. Not
[1:28:15] quite. But he's a wonderful brother,
[1:28:19] very well learned in the
[1:28:21] scriptures. And um I left him church age
[1:28:24] book and a few
[1:28:25] other student in one of the universities
[1:28:28] there.
[1:28:29] I believe we will hear of his baptism
[1:28:32] very
[1:28:34] soon. Amen. Amen. If the whole of my
[1:28:38] trip to Ethiopia was for
[1:28:39] him worth it.
[1:28:44] Amen. Can you give me the next slide?
[1:28:46] All right. So then um uh this is in
[1:28:50] Path. I said Melbourne. This is in Path.
[1:28:53] So in Path we had two services there.
[1:28:56] And the saints really sent greetings,
[1:29:00] very wonderful
[1:29:01] people, wonderful brothers and sisters
[1:29:04] there. And and um on we give me the next
[1:29:07] slide, we move to
[1:29:10] Singapore. Our stay in Australia was
[1:29:12] really a
[1:29:15] blessing. Then not only to them but also
[1:29:18] I believe to
[1:29:19] us. Uh and here
[1:29:23] is uh it was another 5 hours and 30
[1:29:26] minutes
[1:29:30] flight going to to Singapore.
[1:29:34] Now when I arrived at Singapore, I
[1:29:37] realized I told the brothers later
[1:29:40] on we were discussing and they were
[1:29:43] telling me you know the the brothers
[1:29:45] that I was meeting they were in a bigger
[1:29:48] church. So they left it because the
[1:29:51] brothers original brothers there went
[1:29:53] into another
[1:29:56] teaching and the teaching was that they
[1:29:58] are already in the
[1:30:01] millennium. So I told the
[1:30:03] brothers and I told them uh I I don't
[1:30:07] blame those
[1:30:08] brothers for teaching that you are in
[1:30:10] the
[1:30:11] millennium because for sure Singapore
[1:30:14] looks like the
[1:30:17] millennium. It looks like everything is
[1:30:19] in the
[1:30:21] future. The place is so
[1:30:25] futuristic. If you look at the
[1:30:28] airport, I think it's number one in the
[1:30:30] world.
[1:30:33] All of the country island
[1:30:36] Singapore uh is filled in with high-rise
[1:30:42] buildings
[1:30:43] trained connected the whole city is
[1:30:46] connected. Actually most of the people
[1:30:48] there don't
[1:30:51] drive and then they go to where they are
[1:30:54] going and um so they told me well here
[1:30:57] what the people
[1:30:58] do is they eat and shop.
[1:31:03] That's the only tourist attraction that
[1:31:04] is
[1:31:06] there because I mean it's so small, so
[1:31:10] beautiful and and and so
[1:31:12] isolated on the island and and but you
[1:31:15] see the people there are very
[1:31:18] lovely and uh so but I told them uh
[1:31:21] because the people are are so
[1:31:24] comfortable. I told them those who think
[1:31:26] they in the millennium.
[1:31:29] Give me one of them. Let me take them to
[1:31:30] Uganda.
[1:31:32] They will change their
[1:31:36] doctrine. Amen. Amen. Give me the next
[1:31:39] slide, brother. And so this is the
[1:31:41] pastor there,
[1:31:43] brother Dave. Sister Sher, his wife.
[1:31:47] These are wonderful, wonderful people.
[1:31:51] Uh um I mean you could not even feel
[1:31:53] that you're visiting. You you would feel
[1:31:55] that you're like one of
[1:31:59] them. They look young. How how old do
[1:32:02] you think they
[1:32:06] are? 40 years. I told her sister, you
[1:32:09] look
[1:32:11] 45. They're all in their
[1:32:14] 70s. So I said, "No wonder you people
[1:32:16] think you're in the millennium because
[1:32:18] you don't even grow old."
[1:32:23] But anyway, the brother Dave and his
[1:32:25] wife and the believers that I was with
[1:32:26] don't believe that kind of
[1:32:30] doctrine. Very wonderful people and they
[1:32:33] believe what we believe and the
[1:32:36] right and uh give me the next slide. We
[1:32:40] spent much of
[1:32:41] this much of the time we spend doing
[1:32:45] this not eating
[1:32:48] necessarily as much as we ate.
[1:32:51] But we spent it sharing the word around
[1:32:53] the
[1:32:57] food. Every one of them would ask a
[1:33:01] question and we would get into the word
[1:33:03] and enjoy the word and there is a time
[1:33:08] as I was
[1:33:09] sharing I realized I was shouting. I'm
[1:33:12] sorry, brother, because when I get
[1:33:14] anointed, I
[1:33:16] shout. But you are the ones
[1:33:18] because I mean, we enjoyed the
[1:33:20] word until we forgot we were in a
[1:33:24] restaurant like wonderful, wonderful
[1:33:27] people. And right there, the next
[1:33:30] slide. Uh this is brother Joel Chong.
[1:33:36] That is a son of brother uh Dave Dave. I
[1:33:39] specifically want you to pray for him.
[1:33:43] I believe God has something for
[1:33:46] him in that country in if the Lord
[1:33:50] carries that is his
[1:33:52] family and um I just want you to pray
[1:33:55] for
[1:33:56] him. Um if you give me the next slide
[1:34:00] uh that
[1:34:01] is me right there ministering in the
[1:34:05] church and that is um a little bit of
[1:34:09] the
[1:34:10] saints. We we went out after the church.
[1:34:13] We were at the airport there. I mean the
[1:34:14] airport is like we went there to for
[1:34:15] meals and you know for looking
[1:34:18] around and it was a wonderful time after
[1:34:22] the Sunday service.
[1:34:25] Amen. And the saints there in Singapore
[1:34:27] send their
[1:34:29] [Applause]
[1:34:31] greetings. They they they are lovely
[1:34:34] people. Can you give me the next slide
[1:34:37] from Singapore?
[1:34:39] We had to fly to Uganda.
[1:34:41] Uganda through uh through Qatar
[1:34:46] and I was happy I was coming back
[1:34:49] home and I want to say this
[1:34:52] friends I've been in so many countries
[1:34:54] around the
[1:34:56] world when you go
[1:34:58] there only good because of the
[1:35:00] believers.
[1:35:05] Some places I was in Australia were
[1:35:09] hot, others were very
[1:35:11] cold. But in Uganda, Uganda, Singapore
[1:35:15] was very hot.
[1:35:17] But in Uganda,
[1:35:19] Uganda, you have the best weather in the
[1:35:21] world.
[1:35:26] I would want to be in those countries
[1:35:28] where I
[1:35:30] went because of the
[1:35:32] believers, their warmth and their their
[1:35:34] reception and
[1:35:37] everything and but I would like to say
[1:35:40] you should appreciate your
[1:35:42] country. We should appreciate your
[1:35:44] country
[1:35:45] because Uganda is a beautiful country
[1:35:49] and whoever is listening to this and has
[1:35:50] never been in Uganda.
[1:35:53] If you doubt me, come and
[1:35:55] see. Uganda. Amen. But we really
[1:35:59] appreciate the time we spent with the
[1:36:01] believers in those parts of the
[1:36:04] world and um you know uh by the time I
[1:36:07] was going to come I was already
[1:36:09] homesick.
[1:36:12] If you give me this
[1:36:14] quote very tired after ministering all
[1:36:16] those
[1:36:18] days says and I know I I I coped this
[1:36:22] from your status brother
[1:36:25] Julius. Any Christian will think of
[1:36:27] others before
[1:36:32] himself. Every Christian tries to put
[1:36:34] God
[1:36:36] first. his relationship with
[1:36:39] God, his family
[1:36:41] second and he is number
[1:36:44] three and I've tried to pra to I have
[1:36:48] tried to make that a practice in my own
[1:36:53] life. So what is
[1:36:58] second? What is
[1:37:01] second? God first I've been serving for
[1:37:05] about 5 weeks.
[1:37:09] Then number two should
[1:37:14] be I needed to say this is for the
[1:37:17] younger
[1:37:18] couples also for the
[1:37:21] congregation. Give me the next
[1:37:23] slide. So we had when I came
[1:37:26] back I was very
[1:37:30] silent. I did not tell anybody. Those
[1:37:34] who knew I told them please you are on
[1:37:36] oath you should not say anything to
[1:37:38] anyone. So I came back on Monday
[1:37:40] night. I whisked away the
[1:37:43] family and I gave them some time and you
[1:37:47] know you know you know uh for them to
[1:37:49] enjoy also my time before we be begin to
[1:37:52] become busy running up and
[1:37:55] down and I think we had a good
[1:37:57] time like Victoria River night the
[1:38:00] source of the night and and a few other
[1:38:03] you know activities here and
[1:38:05] there and you can see the children were
[1:38:07] really very happy.
[1:38:09] And I also think my wife was happy.
[1:38:12] [Music]
[1:38:14] Uh so I uh you can put that off. I just
[1:38:17] want to say uh I appreciate brother Gary
[1:38:19] who invited us in
[1:38:21] Australia Australia and arranged this
[1:38:24] trip for us.
[1:38:26] Brother Gary is one man that uh is
[1:38:29] really a very humble
[1:38:32] man and he loves this message with all
[1:38:34] his
[1:38:35] heart without ulterior
[1:38:39] motives. You know you want to work with
[1:38:41] someone like
[1:38:42] that. When your connection is not about
[1:38:46] money, power or anything but the gospel,
[1:38:51] the message, the people, those are the
[1:38:53] people you want to associate with.
[1:38:56] Amen. And uh brother Gary sent his
[1:39:00] greetings uh this morning. Brother
[1:39:04] uh Kea sent his greetings
[1:39:07] also and and few others that are that
[1:39:11] new knew that I I'm back home. They all
[1:39:12] sent
[1:39:15] us to the family to the family of God
[1:39:17] here
[1:39:18] in Uganda. We are so
[1:39:22] thankful has been faithful to
[1:39:25] me. I I want to also give my thanks to
[1:39:29] those who have been taking care of my
[1:39:30] family in my
[1:39:32] house. I I learned that there are some
[1:39:35] who took some
[1:39:36] sugar. My wife was saying I told me dear
[1:39:40] do you know
[1:39:41] what I was just wondering where are we
[1:39:43] going to get money for
[1:39:46] sugar? And then someone bought sugar.
[1:39:51] God is a
[1:39:53] provider. I don't even know who the
[1:39:55] person is. I don't remember. But I
[1:39:57] really appreciate you. And there I think
[1:40:00] about a few sisters who
[1:40:02] visited. May May the Lord bless each and
[1:40:04] everyone. Shall we now stand and go to
[1:40:07] the word or should they just go
[1:40:14] home? Amen. Amen. And I really I'm so
[1:40:18] thankful to the
[1:40:19] Lord for what he's doing and what he has
[1:40:22] done. This trip was a blessing to us in
[1:40:25] many
[1:40:26] ways. You certainly want your pastor to
[1:40:29] have a lot of
[1:40:33] experience. Traveling like
[1:40:35] this has a lot of
[1:40:37] reasons, a lot of purposes.
[1:40:40] The main one to
[1:40:43] me, it helps you to get
[1:40:47] exposure to know how to deal with
[1:40:51] things, see how others are doing
[1:40:54] it, you know, you learn a lot by
[1:40:58] observing, looking and and then you
[1:41:01] carry those things back
[1:41:03] home. So all our experience that we we
[1:41:06] garnered from that
[1:41:08] trip, it will certainly be imported down
[1:41:13] here for the blessing of the bride.
[1:41:17] Amen.
[1:41:19] Matthew chapter
[1:41:20] 16. I have a lot to speak
[1:41:23] about. So I'll just go straight away to
[1:41:25] the
[1:41:27] word. I don't know why you have a
[1:41:29] problem because I hear that your sound
[1:41:32] is okay.
[1:41:34] uh Matthew 16:13
[1:41:40] um 1613 and we are going to read up to
[1:41:43] verses
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:53] 18 there are a few believers who gave me
[1:41:56] a lot of candies here and
[1:42:00] there so I said I'll carry them and
[1:42:02] distribute to the children at
[1:42:06] church. So please don't if you have a
[1:42:08] child don't make the child go away
[1:42:11] without sometimes.
[1:42:15] Amen. Amen.
[1:42:17] Shall we pray?
[1:42:20] Lord Jesus,
[1:42:22] we want to thank you Lord for the uh
[1:42:26] opportunity you have given us to go and
[1:42:27] minister to the saints in other parts of
[1:42:29] the world.
[1:42:33] that we should go and preach the gospel
[1:42:35] to all the
[1:42:37] world and we have done just
[1:42:40] that. Now Lord, we are back at our post
[1:42:43] of
[1:42:44] duty and I ask you to give me
[1:42:47] utterance. Help me Lord that I will say
[1:42:50] something this morning that will bless
[1:42:53] your
[1:42:54] people. Grant me utterance, Lord. And
[1:42:58] everyone that has come here
[1:43:00] thirsty, hungering after
[1:43:03] righteousness, may you fill them, Lord.
[1:43:06] We ask this blessing in
[1:43:08] Jesus. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:11] When Jesus came into the course of
[1:43:14] Caseria Philippi, he asked his disciples
[1:43:18] saying, "Whom do men say that I, the son
[1:43:20] of man, am?
[1:43:32] [Music]
[1:43:35] and they said some say that thou art
[1:43:37] John the Baptist some Elias others
[1:43:39] Jeremiah's or one of the
[1:43:50] prophets he said unto them but whom say
[1:43:53] he that I
[1:43:57] am. And Simon Peter answered and said,
[1:43:59] "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[1:44:02] living
[1:44:06] God." And Jesus answered and said unto
[1:44:09] him, "Blessed art thou, Simon by Jonah,
[1:44:12] for flesh and blood has not revealed it
[1:44:15] unto thee, but my Father which is in
[1:44:17] heaven.
[1:44:26] And I say also unto thee, that thou at
[1:44:29] Peter, and upon this rock, upon this
[1:44:31] rock I will build my church, and the
[1:44:34] gate of hell shall not prevail against
[1:44:36] thee.
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:57] So I got this inspiration that I'm going
[1:44:59] to speak on when I was in uh
[1:45:03] Brisbane Brisbane and I titled it our
[1:45:07] true
[1:45:10] origin. I noticed you can preach the
[1:45:13] same subject everywhere but it depends
[1:45:15] on the people how it comes out.
[1:45:22] I mean the needs of the
[1:45:25] people, it is them that pull out what
[1:45:28] what the minister is
[1:45:32] saying. I'm happy to see uh Sister Baka
[1:45:35] back
[1:45:38] there. God bless you and I want to say I
[1:45:41] appreciate each and every one of
[1:45:43] you. Uh my my my my brother here was uh
[1:45:48] sick, brother
[1:45:49] Neville. Uh but I'm glad to see you this
[1:45:53] morning. And uh God bless each and every
[1:45:55] one of
[1:45:56] you. Are we Can we now tune our minds to
[1:46:00] the
[1:46:01] word? How many are going to be
[1:46:06] 100%. Amen. As you know, I'm not a very
[1:46:08] long
[1:46:10] preacher, but I can be long if you are
[1:46:13] long.
[1:46:16] because you have a way of pulling
[1:46:20] sometimes and then you notice that you
[1:46:22] have gone
[1:46:26] longer. Praise the name of the
[1:46:28] Lord. If you want, God will fill
[1:46:32] you. If you desire, God will provide
[1:46:35] you.
[1:46:37] So can we place now our minds back
[1:46:41] here that God will speak to us. How many
[1:46:45] desire for the Lord to speak to us?
[1:46:49] Amen. So just um uh believe pray for me.
[1:46:54] I realize I'm feeling I'm still
[1:46:56] tired. I thought I'm back up but I'm
[1:46:59] still
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:02] tired. But the Lord is good. our true
[1:47:08] origin. Now, the church is built upon
[1:47:12] the revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:47:17] is. I'm the church. You are the church
[1:47:21] and you are built upon the revelation of
[1:47:23] who Jesus Christ
[1:47:26] is. And I warn you, there are many
[1:47:28] brothers who have been preaching here on
[1:47:29] the pullpit.
[1:47:32] We can never compare
[1:47:36] gifts. We appreciate every
[1:47:40] gift and every gift is
[1:47:43] different and every gift is
[1:47:45] useful and God has used each and every
[1:47:48] one of
[1:47:49] them and we appreciate each and every
[1:47:52] one of
[1:47:53] them but none of them can take each
[1:47:55] other's
[1:47:57] place and I realize that I cannot preach
[1:48:00] like
[1:48:02] them. They cannot preach like
[1:48:04] me. So uh if um you are desiring the
[1:48:08] Lord to speak to you this
[1:48:11] morning, just receive it as according to
[1:48:13] how the Lord has given it to
[1:48:18] me. Amen. So we need
[1:48:22] revelation more than anything else in
[1:48:24] the
[1:48:25] world.
[1:48:27] Revelation more than anything else in
[1:48:30] the
[1:48:31] world. The reason why you are the way
[1:48:34] you are
[1:48:37] still not overcoming certain things in
[1:48:39] your
[1:48:40] life is because you lack
[1:48:44] revelation. A person, a man who has
[1:48:49] revelation of who they
[1:48:51] are. They live an overcoming
[1:48:55] life. So you see that's why the
[1:48:58] church is built upon the
[1:49:02] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:49:06] is. And later we shall find
[1:49:08] out that if you know if you have the
[1:49:11] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[1:49:15] is, you will have a revelation of who
[1:49:17] you
[1:49:19] are. Without the revelation of who
[1:49:21] Christ
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:24] is, we cannot know who we
[1:49:27] are. If we do not know who we
[1:49:30] are, we cannot overcome the
[1:49:34] world. Jesus overcame the
[1:49:37] world. How did he overcome the world? Do
[1:49:41] you realize that Jesus was a man like
[1:49:43] you and me?
[1:49:46] How many understand that Jesus was a
[1:49:49] human
[1:49:50] being? He was a man with
[1:49:53] flesh with
[1:49:56] blood. He was just like
[1:49:59] you. But how come he
[1:50:03] overcame? Do you know he had a
[1:50:09] will? He had a choice to
[1:50:12] make. And in his will
[1:50:15] He never wanted to
[1:50:18] die. He went and prayed. He said, "Oh
[1:50:22] God, let this cup pass from
[1:50:25] me." But he realized God had another
[1:50:29] will. He said, "Okay, not according to
[1:50:32] my will, but according to your
[1:50:35] will." Now, when you have a revelation
[1:50:38] of who you
[1:50:41] are, you walk in the will of
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:45] God. Even when you don't feel it, even
[1:50:49] when you don't see it, but you walk in
[1:50:52] it by
[1:50:55] faith. Jesus overcame the
[1:50:58] world because he knew who he
[1:51:02] was. Period.
[1:51:05] That is the victory that overcomes all.
[1:51:09] Amen. To know who you
[1:51:14] are now friends.
[1:51:18] Jesus. Yes. Follow me. Follow me. Follow
[1:51:20] me. I don't want anyone
[1:51:23] sleeping. We are on serious business
[1:51:25] this
[1:51:28] morning. Here is
[1:51:30] Jesus gathering his disciples.
[1:51:35] And he he be began asking them, "Who do
[1:51:39] you say? Who do people say that I
[1:51:43] am? Who do people say that I, the son of
[1:51:46] man,
[1:51:48] [Music]
[1:51:49] am?" Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:51:52] Do you
[1:51:53] realize
[1:51:55] Jesus has three
[1:52:00] sunship in that ministry of a
[1:52:03] son in that dispensation as a
[1:52:06] son? He's a son three
[1:52:10] times and I want us to understand
[1:52:13] scripture
[1:52:14] tonight. If you can give me that second
[1:52:16] slide, that other
[1:52:19] slide. Yes. Thank you, brother.
[1:52:21] Oh, you're very good today. God bless
[1:52:23] you. Let us clap for brother Marvin.
[1:52:27] All right. So, we see here the three
[1:52:30] comingings of Jesus
[1:52:31] Christ. We see he comes first as a son
[1:52:35] of
[1:52:37] man. Everybody say son of
[1:52:40] man. Now, as a son of man, he is a human
[1:52:47] being. He's a prophet.
[1:52:51] He's a man but with a prophetic
[1:52:55] ministry. So that's why he asked the
[1:52:59] disciples, who do the people
[1:53:02] say that I the son of man
[1:53:07] am? Who do people say that I the prophet
[1:53:13] am? And the people say and the and the
[1:53:15] disciples say oh they know you are a
[1:53:18] prophet.
[1:53:20] They call they are saying either you are
[1:53:22] Jeremiah or you are Elijah or you are
[1:53:27] you know one of the
[1:53:29] prophets one of the
[1:53:32] prophets. Some even think you are John
[1:53:34] the
[1:53:35] Baptist because as a son of
[1:53:38] man as a son of man he was a
[1:53:42] prophet like the other prophet.
[1:53:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You had to have
[1:53:50] extra
[1:53:52] revelation. See
[1:53:54] Jesus beyond the ministry he was in on
[1:53:58] earth at the
[1:54:02] time. Everybody saw him as a
[1:54:05] man. Everybody saw him as a prophet.
[1:54:09] Until today we have a full
[1:54:12] religion sees him only as a
[1:54:15] prophet and it is called Islam.
[1:54:18] And they are right. He was a prophet.
[1:54:22] But I want to tell you friends, he was
[1:54:24] more than a
[1:54:28] prophet. That's why when he asked the
[1:54:30] disciples, who do they say? And then the
[1:54:33] disciples say they say you are
[1:54:36] Jeremiah the Baptist or one of the
[1:54:39] prophets. But then Jesus changed the
[1:54:42] question and he said, "What about you?
[1:54:45] What about you? You the one that I've
[1:54:47] called. You the one that I've chosen.
[1:54:50] Who do you say that I the son of
[1:54:54] man? And then they open. Everybody was
[1:54:57] gazing and looking. But one of them had
[1:55:01] received
[1:55:03] something which was not from a
[1:55:05] school, something which was not from a
[1:55:09] church but came directly from
[1:55:13] God. It is called revelation.
[1:55:17] And when revelation struck
[1:55:19] him, he saw
[1:55:21] Jesus more than he was looking at the
[1:55:28] time. It is something I'm getting into
[1:55:31] this
[1:55:32] morning. Jesus Christ is the same
[1:55:36] yesterday. Everybody say yesterday and
[1:55:39] today
[1:55:41] and forever. Okay, let us come now. G
[1:55:45] this Jesus who is here at the
[1:55:48] time. The disciples said Peter by
[1:55:52] revelation said
[1:55:54] you are Jesus
[1:55:56] Christ the
[1:55:59] son of
[1:56:01] man. No he never said that. But he said,
[1:56:06] "You, the way I see you, you are Jesus
[1:56:11] Christ, son of the living God."
[1:56:17] Peter, listen, listen. You are about to
[1:56:20] get it. Peter saw
[1:56:22] Jesus as a son of
[1:56:25] God. That is a higher ministry.
[1:56:31] Son of God is a Holy Ghost
[1:56:35] ministry. God is a spirit. Son of God is
[1:56:41] God.
[1:56:43] Oh, son of pig is a pig. Son of God is a
[1:56:47] God. Son of of of sheep is sheep. Son of
[1:56:52] God
[1:56:54] is. So by saying you are a son of
[1:56:58] God, he meant Peter had received a
[1:57:02] revelation. The Jehovah of the
[1:57:07] Lord of heaven and earth had put on
[1:57:10] flesh and was standing right before him
[1:57:14] because son of
[1:57:16] God the Holy Ghost
[1:57:20] dispensation the same
[1:57:24] Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen. And we know him
[1:57:27] is coming back again as son of David.
[1:57:32] Amen. as the judge
[1:57:34] now is coming as a king to
[1:57:38] reign. Amen. With his right with a rod
[1:57:41] of
[1:57:42] iron. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:57:44] That's the kingship
[1:57:46] ministry. So Peter by
[1:57:49] revelation saw
[1:57:51] Jesus not only as a son of
[1:57:53] God. He saw him as a son of God. He saw
[1:57:58] him saw
[1:58:00] himself. He saw him as God filled in
[1:58:04] flesh. Hey, I want you to get it. He saw
[1:58:08] him as
[1:58:09] God flesh. He saw him as
[1:58:16] deity. He saw beyond the
[1:58:19] skin. He saw beyond the badger
[1:58:23] skin. Oh my my my. Amen. He saw beyond
[1:58:27] what they
[1:58:29] saw. They the Pharisees and
[1:58:34] the ones who had no
[1:58:36] revelation. He saw a man prophet
[1:58:40] like but you saw you know Peter Peter
[1:58:43] saw something else. By revelation you
[1:58:47] saw more than
[1:58:49] one. Amen. You saw that this one was not
[1:58:53] just a prophet on earth. He's not just a
[1:58:56] man, but he's more than a man. He's more
[1:58:59] than a prophet. God
[1:59:02] himself veiled in human
[1:59:05] life. Amen. And the church of Jesus
[1:59:08] Christ will see the same thing
[1:59:12] today. Jesus is the same yesterday and
[1:59:17] this thing is coming down to
[1:59:19] you. When you see me, what do you see?
[1:59:25] Hallelujah.
[1:59:27] Amen. Someone just go. When you see me,
[1:59:31] what do you see? Because Jesus Christ is
[1:59:34] the same as yesterday. Today.
[1:59:38] Today. Where is he today? Where is it
[1:59:41] today? It's right here. He's asking you
[1:59:45] a question. Where what do people say
[1:59:47] that
[1:59:50] I speaking in first person pronoun?
[1:59:55] Who do people say the son of
[1:59:57] God? Some
[2:00:00] say others say you a pastor. Others say
[2:00:04] you are a son of ro. Others say but what
[2:00:08] do you say I
[2:00:10] am? Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. But what
[2:00:13] do you say I am? Well others say you a
[2:00:17] sinner. Others say you did this. Others
[2:00:20] say you have this. Say you are a liar as
[2:00:24] your father. Would you say
[2:00:26] liar? Amen. If you have
[2:00:29] revelation say what others are
[2:00:33] saying, you will
[2:00:35] see I am a son of
[2:00:39] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Yes, sir.
[2:00:42] Amen. The Bible says,
[2:00:44] "Beloved, now are we the sons of God. It
[2:00:48] does not yet appear that we shall
[2:00:53] be shall be
[2:00:56] like." Amen. Amen. Who are we? We are
[2:00:59] the sons of God. You should see beyond
[2:01:04] yourself. You should see beyond your
[2:01:06] skin. Amen. You are not what they say
[2:01:09] you are.
[2:01:10] You are not what the word
[2:01:12] says. Not what your situation says. You
[2:01:16] are not what your body says. You are
[2:01:19] more than what your body say. You are
[2:01:21] more than what your eyes see. You are
[2:01:24] more than what everybody else. You are a
[2:01:27] son of
[2:01:30] God. Hallelujah. Yes, sir. Hallelujah.
[2:01:34] You may think I've gone
[2:01:35] crazy. That's what they thought about
[2:01:37] Jesus.
[2:01:39] He thought he was crazy.
[2:01:41] They wanted to kill him, but he knew who
[2:01:44] he
[2:01:45] was. Hallelujah. He stood in one
[2:01:48] place and he never
[2:01:50] [Applause]
[2:01:51] [Music]
[2:01:53] wavered. Matthew
[2:01:58] 4:1. Then was Jesus led up of the spirit
[2:02:01] into the wilderness.
[2:02:06] Jesus was led up of the
[2:02:09] spirit into the wilderness. Read the
[2:02:13] Bible in the present
[2:02:15] day. Don't read it as a book of
[2:02:19] history. Then
[2:02:21] was led up into the earth.
[2:02:27] Can you put your name right
[2:02:29] there? Hallelujah. Then you were led
[2:02:32] into the earth. Was Jesus led up into
[2:02:36] the wild? For what purpose?
[2:02:39] Why are you here? To be tempted of the
[2:02:43] devil.
[2:02:47] And when I want to tell you, temptation
[2:02:50] is not
[2:02:51] sin. Everyone that comes to God will be
[2:02:55] tempted. You know the Bible say everyone
[2:02:58] is tempted according to their
[2:03:01] lust. You see because why we have this
[2:03:05] body why we came here in this body to be
[2:03:10] tempted tempted and tried we are made of
[2:03:13] to
[2:03:16] wonder why there are many about
[2:03:19] us about us feeling so wicked they in
[2:03:24] the wrong things seem to be fine for
[2:03:27] them but for me I am here to be tempted
[2:03:31] I am not going to be happy with
[2:03:34] sin. I I am here to be tempted. After
[2:03:38] being tempted, I must
[2:03:41] overcome. I must
[2:03:44] overcome. The only thing that is going
[2:03:47] to make me overcome is realizing
[2:03:52] [Music]
[2:03:53] who. So in other words, the devil wanted
[2:03:56] Jesus to obey
[2:03:58] him. But you know God cannot obey the
[2:04:04] devil. Amen. But how did Jesus overcome
[2:04:09] the cannot overcome the
[2:04:11] devil?
[2:04:13] By shaking
[2:04:15] shaking doing
[2:04:17] miracles.
[2:04:19] Miracle cannot
[2:04:21] prove who he is.
[2:04:25] No. Because the devil wanted Jesus to do
[2:04:30] a
[2:04:32] miracle turn these stones into
[2:04:36] bread. Oh, thank God for this
[2:04:39] message because we've been told the
[2:04:42] devil can impersonate
[2:04:48] everything. The devil can do all the
[2:04:50] signs and wonders.
[2:04:54] That's why we are not Pentecostal by
[2:04:58] denomination because they look and seek
[2:05:00] for
[2:05:03] sign. But right here at this place,
[2:05:08] Jesus proved who he was without
[2:05:15] saying. But he answered, "It is written,
[2:05:20] man shall not live by bread.
[2:05:25] Hallelujah.
[2:05:27] [Music]
[2:05:28] Jesus knew who he was, but when he's
[2:05:32] talking to the devil,
[2:05:34] he calls himself a man.
[2:05:40] He didn't say son of God shall not live
[2:05:43] by bread alone but
[2:05:46] man shall not live by bread alone
[2:05:49] because the
[2:05:51] miracle
[2:05:52] wanted the son of God did not need
[2:05:58] it but
[2:06:03] man. Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. We have
[2:06:06] another ministry. We have gone beyond
[2:06:09] the ministry of
[2:06:13] miracles. We fly in the ministry of the
[2:06:18] world, the
[2:06:20] revelation of Jesus
[2:06:24] Christ, the revealing of
[2:06:26] him. You know when he's
[2:06:29] revealed signs and wonders automatically
[2:06:32] follow him
[2:06:40] every but by every
[2:06:45] word a man that knows who he truly is.
[2:06:50] He's going to live by the
[2:06:51] word. By the word. By the word. By the
[2:06:56] word.
[2:06:58] Not by anything
[2:06:59] else. Amen. But Jesus knew who he was.
[2:07:03] The devil
[2:07:05] doubted change
[2:07:07] Jesus's understanding of who he
[2:07:12] was. All right. Amen. The devil doubts
[2:07:15] who you
[2:07:17] are. You see where I told you if you
[2:07:20] know who he is, you will know who you
[2:07:21] are.
[2:07:25] Oh, somebody preach with me this
[2:07:26] morning. The devil doubts who you
[2:07:30] are. Look at her. Look at her. She's
[2:07:34] going to fail. She's going to
[2:07:38] fall. He thinks, let me tell you, the
[2:07:42] devil will speak whatever he wants to.
[2:07:46] He will speak and
[2:07:48] prophesy and he
[2:07:55] speak the child of God that knows what
[2:07:59] they are. Amen.
[2:08:03] Amen. Yes, sir. That's why Jesus said
[2:08:06] when when Peter said, "I know who you
[2:08:09] are. You are Jesus
[2:08:12] Christ of the living God." Jesus must
[2:08:16] have
[2:08:17] Jack and he said
[2:08:23] flesh and
[2:08:24] blood has not revealed it but my father
[2:08:29] in other words but the
[2:08:32] spirit flesh and blood has not revealed
[2:08:34] this to me but the spirit has revealed
[2:08:37] it
[2:08:38] to my father
[2:08:41] where in heaven where is heavenuru The
[2:08:45] Bible says heaven is not coming with
[2:08:47] observation of
[2:08:52] eyes. Heaven is right in your
[2:08:55] heart. Hallelujah. Peter, my father in
[2:09:00] heaven.
[2:09:01] My father right before
[2:09:03] you right out of you because the son of
[2:09:08] God has a
[2:09:10] revelation which comes from God rise out
[2:09:14] of their soul.
[2:09:20] The throne of God is in your heart.
[2:09:26] No one teaches a an
[2:09:29] eagle to fly. It is in
[2:09:34] it. No one teaches a
[2:09:37] snake to bite and
[2:09:40] to it is in
[2:09:43] it. No one teaches a
[2:09:45] child to cry
[2:09:49] for no one taught you from the moment
[2:09:53] you were born. Amen. You may not have
[2:09:56] known that is this
[2:09:59] one is breast
[2:10:03] milk, but you desired it. You wanted it
[2:10:07] because the deep was calling from the
[2:10:11] deep. Something that was in you had a
[2:10:15] revelation. There is somewhere for
[2:10:20] me. You are hearing them.
[2:10:24] And then when they
[2:10:28] [Music]
[2:10:30] put what's happening, they have found
[2:10:33] what they
[2:10:34] desired. No one teaches a child of
[2:10:38] God who they are. Hallelujah.
[2:10:43] You can't get it from a
[2:10:44] seminary. You can't get it from the
[2:10:46] church. You receive it by
[2:10:51] revelation. Amen.
[2:10:55] Revelation from
[2:10:59] God in you.
[2:11:08] There is a river of
[2:11:10] life. It
[2:11:12] flows out of where? Out of me.
[2:11:19] his
[2:11:20] gates and prisons. There is a river of
[2:11:25] life. God is the river of life. Flesh
[2:11:29] and blood revealed this. But my father
[2:11:32] in
[2:11:34] heaven upon this rock I will build my
[2:11:38] church of hell.
[2:11:42] Amen. Jesus built his church upon the
[2:11:47] revelation of who he was or rather let
[2:11:50] me say of who he
[2:11:52] is. And even today the church of Jesus
[2:11:55] Christ is built upon
[2:11:59] that. Amen. Children of God when they
[2:12:01] hear the
[2:12:02] word. Amen. When they hear the
[2:12:05] word they receive the
[2:12:11] revelation. Even now some of you are
[2:12:14] s just comes to
[2:12:16] you and I'll say
[2:12:19] it. It just comes to you by hearing the
[2:12:22] word. That's why he says go to all the
[2:12:25] all the
[2:12:26] world
[2:12:27] preach when the children of God when the
[2:12:30] sons of God hear the word recognize who
[2:12:34] they are. Hallelujah. Hey, I'm not poor.
[2:12:38] I'm not a sinner. I'm not what people
[2:12:41] said I am. I am not a thief. I am not an
[2:12:45] I am not. Soon when you realize who you
[2:12:50] are, you go back to your
[2:12:52] friends, you tell them I am
[2:12:59] sorry. I had forgotten who I
[2:13:03] was. But now I
[2:13:05] know I cannot be a part to this.
[2:13:10] I cannot go out and smoke with you.
[2:13:14] I cannot be defeated
[2:13:18] by when everybody's dressing the skimpy
[2:13:21] skirt. Oh, you would tell them I'm
[2:13:24] sorry, I can't have this anymore. But if
[2:13:27] someone has not received this
[2:13:30] re, let me tell you, brother, preacher
[2:13:33] men who are here, you can get this
[2:13:36] Bible. You bang their
[2:13:39] head and you tell them stop
[2:13:42] dressing. They will never stop.
[2:13:47] If they will help you, they will stop it
[2:13:49] in your
[2:13:53] presence. But when you are gone, they
[2:13:57] will show their true color. proof.
[2:14:00] That's why this is the most important
[2:14:04] thing that should be preached to the
[2:14:07] church. Hallelujah. The work of the
[2:14:11] ministry. Hallelujah. Is to remind you
[2:14:14] who you
[2:14:15] are. Don't worry. Some of you are taking
[2:14:18] too long to
[2:14:20] remember. But I tell you, keep coming to
[2:14:24] the word. Keep coming to the church.
[2:14:27] Keep hearing the word.
[2:14:29] One of these days you will
[2:14:32] remember. Hallelujah.
[2:14:36] But Jesus knew who he was. Amen. And the
[2:14:39] Bible says in 1 John
[2:14:43] 3:2
[2:14:46] now. Hallelujah. Give me this verse.
[2:14:50] Now we are the sons of
[2:14:55] God. Did you get it?
[2:14:58] Brother Marvin, I'll come and shake you
[2:15:02] up. Listen. When did he say we are the
[2:15:05] sons of
[2:15:07] God? After the
[2:15:10] rapture. Now, come on, tell your
[2:15:13] neighbor
[2:15:14] now. Tell another neighbor
[2:15:16] now.
[2:15:19] Now, we are the sons of
[2:15:23] God. Oh, we are the sons of God. Okay,
[2:15:26] let's do something here. Amen. Tell
[2:15:29] yourself two times now. I'm the son of
[2:15:33] God. Now I'm the son of God.
[2:15:38] Did you believe it? Okay. Did you
[2:15:41] receive the
[2:15:42] revelation? You have not quite yet
[2:15:44] because if you have some of you have
[2:15:46] been jumping and
[2:15:49] shouting you are saying it but your mind
[2:15:53] is telling you you
[2:16:06] are I didn't come from there. I am not
[2:16:11] I am not a city. I am not
[2:16:14] a wake up. I am not au.
[2:16:21] Hello.
[2:16:22] [Music]
[2:16:30] Hello. I am not any of those.
[2:16:36] I have found out who I am.
[2:16:41] I am a son of
[2:16:45] God. Sons of
[2:16:48] God are
[2:16:54] gods. God can never be defeated.
[2:16:59] That's why Jesus said, "Those who
[2:17:02] receive this
[2:17:04] revelation, the gates of
[2:17:06] hell shall not
[2:17:09] prepare against them."
[2:17:12] Amen. Yes. Son will
[2:17:15] fight. You bring sickness. You bring
[2:17:19] many things. It cannot
[2:17:21] defeat the son of God.
[2:17:25] It cannot defeat the child of God who
[2:17:29] knows who they
[2:17:32] are. You tell yourself every day you
[2:17:35] wake
[2:17:36] up, I am not blind. I am not sick. I am
[2:17:41] not poor. I am not suffering. I am not
[2:17:45] sorry. I'm not feeling bad. I am an
[2:17:49] overcomer. Why? Because you know, you
[2:17:53] have received a
[2:17:55] revelation who you are.
[2:17:58] Amen. Amen. Amen. And the Bible says it
[2:18:03] does not yet
[2:18:06] appear what we shall
[2:18:10] be. Hallelujah. It doesn't appear yet
[2:18:14] because we are still wearing the robe of
[2:18:16] flesh.
[2:18:18] But tell the devil, don't be deceived by
[2:18:21] what you're
[2:18:23] seeing. I am not what you're
[2:18:25] seeing. I am beyond what you're
[2:18:29] seeing. And then he says, but we
[2:18:33] know
[2:18:36] revelation. But we
[2:18:39] have when he
[2:18:43] shall we, we we
[2:18:45] I shall be like him.
[2:18:49] For we shall see him as he
[2:18:55] is. You have to learn by revelation to
[2:19:00] put the devil.
[2:19:16] Enough of being a
[2:19:17] victim. The church is coming to a
[2:19:20] place. Amen. The bride is arriving at a
[2:19:23] place where she's
[2:19:26] realizing we are not a
[2:19:30] victim to them that will
[2:19:33] overcome. They shall sit with
[2:19:35] me in my
[2:19:38] throne. Hallelujah.
[2:19:41] You see, when you receive this
[2:19:44] revelation, you cannot live below
[2:19:47] privilege. You cannot eat with the pigs
[2:19:50] anymore. You would tell yourself, "How
[2:19:53] can I eat with the pigs anymore? I know
[2:19:56] who I am. I rather be a servant in my
[2:20:00] father's house, but I cannot eat with a
[2:20:02] pig
[2:20:03] anymore." Brother, sister, stop serving
[2:20:07] sin.
[2:20:09] walk away. How can I overcome? How you
[2:20:13] can the power to
[2:20:15] overcome is not coming from heaven. The
[2:20:18] power to overcome is right in
[2:20:21] you comes by the spoken
[2:20:24] word. What you are hearing right now is
[2:20:28] putting strength in your in your soul.
[2:20:32] Amen. to overcome the world, to overcome
[2:20:35] sin, to overcome what the devil
[2:20:38] thinks he has done in your life. It is a
[2:20:45] revelation. That's why even in the dark
[2:20:48] ages, some believers died
[2:20:53] suffering. They died by reaping their
[2:20:57] stomachs. But what made them do that?
[2:21:02] They had a
[2:21:05] revelation. They had a revelation that
[2:21:08] went beyond the
[2:21:12] flesh and saw what nobody
[2:21:18] saw. Why would
[2:21:20] Steven willingly allow people to stone
[2:21:23] him to
[2:21:24] death? He had a
[2:21:27] revelation and then he says he's right
[2:21:30] here on earth. But then he says, "I
[2:21:33] see the son of man." Amen. Standing up.
[2:21:37] I see the son of God standing up. Let me
[2:21:40] tell you, friend. Peter, Paul, Steven,
[2:21:43] and all these ones had
[2:21:45] revelation. They had a revelation of who
[2:21:48] they were and where they were going.
[2:21:52] They lived in another world. They do not
[2:21:55] live in this world. Oh, may God raise a
[2:21:59] generation of
[2:22:00] people, younger
[2:22:02] men, younger women who are going to have
[2:22:06] a
[2:22:07] revelation beyond this
[2:22:10] flesh, beyond this
[2:22:12] flesh. Don't allow your flesh to control
[2:22:16] you. Don't allow. It will
[2:22:20] try. But if you know who you are, it
[2:22:23] cannot
[2:22:24] prevail. It cannot
[2:22:28] prevail. The boy was in sin. And when
[2:22:32] the revelation struck
[2:22:34] him, he came to
[2:22:37] himself. He came to himself. That is
[2:22:41] revelation. He said, "I'll go to my
[2:22:45] father." And the father can never
[2:22:47] receive you as a servant.
[2:22:50] He can never leave you take a servant's
[2:22:52] place.
[2:22:56] No matter how much sin you have done in
[2:22:59] your
[2:23:03] life in this life, it does not
[2:23:07] count. The
[2:23:08] moment this revelation strikes your
[2:23:12] heart. When this revelation strikes your
[2:23:16] heart, all the
[2:23:18] past becomes
[2:23:21] [Music]
[2:23:24] wiped. Someone can hear these
[2:23:27] words and they will go back and see.
[2:23:30] Why? Because they have not
[2:23:33] received. But when you receive the
[2:23:37] revelation, you just come
[2:23:40] running. This deacon brother
[2:23:43] that I was speaking
[2:23:45] about. He was into a lot of
[2:23:48] things including
[2:23:50] drugs, many things and he was in prison
[2:23:54] and chained by
[2:23:55] it and for
[2:23:57] years. But one day he
[2:24:01] found he found a
[2:24:03] revelation of who he was. And the moment
[2:24:07] it struck him, let me tell you, it
[2:24:09] changed him so
[2:24:11] much that unless if he tells you his
[2:24:14] history, you cannot know
[2:24:18] it. When this revelation strikes
[2:24:21] you, it changes
[2:24:25] you. There is a power in
[2:24:30] knowing. And now he's a loving
[2:24:34] man, a family man, serving
[2:24:38] God. That's what I'm talking about.
[2:24:42] You might be here and you're a young man
[2:24:45] and you know you are
[2:24:46] bound by chains of
[2:24:49] darkness. Let me tell you, it doesn't
[2:24:51] matter how many times you come to
[2:24:52] church, you must
[2:24:55] pray for anything. Pray that God gives
[2:24:58] you
[2:25:00] revelation. If God gives you the
[2:25:03] revelation, you will stop seeing things
[2:25:05] the way you are seeing them
[2:25:10] now.
[2:25:15] Amen. Jesus know it by
[2:25:18] faith in the revelation of God's word in
[2:25:20] his own predestinated
[2:25:26] life. He is a predestinated life.
[2:25:31] in his oh my good
[2:25:34] Lord those whom he
[2:25:37] forneew he also
[2:25:40] predestinated to be
[2:25:43] conformed unto the
[2:25:46] image of his
[2:25:48] son. So what does it mean? It begins
[2:25:52] with
[2:25:53] fornowledge. How were you
[2:25:55] fornown? You were
[2:25:58] fornown in him before the foundation of
[2:26:02] the
[2:26:03] world. Oh, am I preaching to
[2:26:06] someone? You were in
[2:26:08] him before sin
[2:26:10] was, before temptation was, before the
[2:26:14] flesh was, before blood was. In him, you
[2:26:18] were perfect. In him, you were sinless.
[2:26:22] him. You are for no as perfect as he
[2:26:26] was.
[2:26:30] Hallelujah.
[2:26:34] And after you were fornown,
[2:26:36] you were
[2:26:39] predestinated. Hallelujah.
[2:26:43] predestinated unto
[2:26:47] confirmation to
[2:26:50] become into the image of a
[2:26:56] son. This
[2:26:59] image is a perfect
[2:27:03] image which
[2:27:06] Jesus was
[2:27:09] in. Hallelujah. Yes sir.
[2:27:16] That's revelation striking the sister.
[2:27:20] That's what
[2:27:22] happens.
[2:27:23] Listen, this
[2:27:25] image is the same
[2:27:28] image which was there before the
[2:27:33] fall. Before the
[2:27:36] fall. Before the
[2:27:38] fall. When Adam was
[2:27:41] perfect and the Bible says we were
[2:27:45] predestinated to be conformed to the
[2:27:49] image of
[2:27:54] sons
[2:27:55] now says Jesus knew it by
[2:28:00] faith in the revelation of God's
[2:28:03] word in his own predestinated life.
[2:28:11] I knew it by
[2:28:13] faith in my predestinated
[2:28:18] life. That is this
[2:28:20] life which came from my
[2:28:23] mother. But this is not my real
[2:28:27] life. This keeps fighting
[2:28:30] me. This keeps dragging me to hell.
[2:28:35] But there is another
[2:28:36] life that I had before I came
[2:28:39] here. In this life, I grown. I become
[2:28:44] sick. I become
[2:28:46] troubled. I have many issues. But in the
[2:28:50] other life, I am perfect,
[2:28:53] sinless. Because that is my true
[2:29:00] origin. Hallelujah. I came from God.
[2:29:05] go back to God.
[2:29:09] Amen. Yes
[2:29:11] sir.
[2:29:12] Jesus when he was on earth he was a man
[2:29:17] he cried he became tired he became sick
[2:29:20] maybe I don't
[2:29:22] know he he cried when Lazarus died his
[2:29:25] friend he had
[2:29:27] feelings he feared
[2:29:30] death but as
[2:29:32] God in the
[2:29:35] other in the other
[2:29:37] life in the other
[2:29:40] origin stood up and he said, "I came
[2:29:43] from God. I go back to
[2:29:46] God." Amen. And when things came,
[2:29:50] Amen. He said, "Lazarus, come out."
[2:29:53] Why? He had authority. He was an an
[2:29:56] adopted
[2:29:59] son. When things happened, he had
[2:30:03] authority. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:30:06] Sons have authority.
[2:30:11] Hallelujah. Glory to God. Sons of
[2:30:14] kingdom authority.
[2:30:17] Amen. Sons of God. You have kingdom
[2:30:23] authority. You have kingdom
[2:30:25] authority. Amen. To control the way
[2:30:30] events happen in your life.
[2:30:34] [Applause]
[2:30:35] right here. Right now, we have that
[2:30:41] authority. It does not appear what we
[2:30:43] shall
[2:30:45] be. But tell
[2:30:47] somebody, wait and
[2:30:50] see. Hallelujah. If you think we're just
[2:30:53] making some
[2:30:55] noise, just wait and see.
[2:31:01] Every son that comes to God,
[2:31:04] when they realize who they
[2:31:05] are, then the habits begin to fall
[2:31:09] away, the the wrong appetites begin to
[2:31:12] fly
[2:31:14] away and something in their
[2:31:17] heart begins to convince
[2:31:20] them. You are not made to eat with the
[2:31:24] pigs.
[2:31:26] You were not
[2:31:27] made to go out in this kind of
[2:31:30] parties. And the spirit of God begin to
[2:31:32] talk to them. You don't belong here. You
[2:31:35] don't belong here. You don't belong
[2:31:37] here. You begin to cool over
[2:31:40] them. And then revelation will build up
[2:31:43] in them. And then when they come to
[2:31:46] themselves, something will
[2:31:49] happen, something they can't
[2:31:52] explain, something they
[2:31:55] know. It it is all in
[2:31:58] knowing. And when they receive a
[2:32:00] revelation, this is who I am. They will
[2:32:04] turn their back on
[2:32:06] sin.
[2:32:10] Hallelujah.
[2:32:12] Jesus. Satan was wondering who Jesus
[2:32:16] was. But Jesus knew who he
[2:32:20] was and he knew he was a predestinated
[2:32:24] creature of
[2:32:27] God that God himself was manifested in
[2:32:33] him.
[2:32:36] Amen. Would you believe me, sister? If I
[2:32:39] tell you God himself is manifested in
[2:32:42] you,
[2:32:47] that's too heavy for the devil to take
[2:32:48] it.
[2:32:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, I've
[2:32:54] spoken for 1 hour. Give me a few more
[2:32:56] minutes. He know that he was a secret
[2:32:58] that God himself was it wasn't him doing
[2:33:00] the work.
[2:33:05] You don't have to struggle.
[2:33:09] Let me do this so that God will accept
[2:33:12] you. Stop doing, stop
[2:33:15] trying, just receive the
[2:33:18] revelation. God will do the
[2:33:21] works. Hallelujah. Amen. Himself will do
[2:33:25] the
[2:33:26] works.
[2:33:27] way. I I received a testimony from a
[2:33:31] sister who said, "It came to a
[2:33:34] point where even when I came close to
[2:33:36] this
[2:33:38] man that I used to so love that their
[2:33:42] perfumes would drive me
[2:33:44] crazy and now when I come close to him,
[2:33:47] I just feel like
[2:33:49] for something in me can
[2:33:54] take a revelation.
[2:33:58] When he stretch your
[2:33:59] heart, it changes you and you become
[2:34:02] pregnant with the
[2:34:06] word and then you begin acting
[2:34:10] up. He knew the word Jesus
[2:34:13] did and Satan did also. You could even
[2:34:17] quote the
[2:34:18] scripture. Oh, just like a walking
[2:34:21] Bible. You could quote it like that. But
[2:34:24] Jesus just stood
[2:34:27] still for he knew where he was standing.
[2:34:31] He know he was the predestinated lamb
[2:34:33] that was before the
[2:34:36] foundation. He know he was that
[2:34:39] person. Listen to me church. Jesus knew
[2:34:44] he was the lamb of God that was slain
[2:34:47] before the foundation of the world. What
[2:34:49] about you?
[2:34:51] I know I am a child of God that the lamb
[2:34:57] was slain for
[2:34:59] [Music]
[2:35:01] before the foundation of the
[2:35:06] world. I was in
[2:35:09] him before the
[2:35:11] foundation. He know he was predestinated
[2:35:14] for
[2:35:15] that. I know I am predestinated to
[2:35:17] overcome
[2:35:20] And that's the way he knew the
[2:35:23] word. And it
[2:35:27] worked. Satan knew it by
[2:35:30] wisdom and it
[2:35:32] failed. Know the word by
[2:35:36] revelation. It will not fail. It will
[2:35:41] work. And like Job, if you're suffering
[2:35:44] in this
[2:35:45] life, you can say, even though the skin
[2:35:49] My skin is destroyed by
[2:35:51] once. I know I will see
[2:35:54] him. You see, you say it by
[2:35:57] revelation. You look beyond what you
[2:36:02] see. Look beyond what you
[2:36:07] see. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let me try
[2:36:10] to finish up with this.
[2:36:14] I want you to go to John
[2:36:16] 8 vers 37.
[2:36:19] I want us to see how the Jews fail to
[2:36:21] understand Jesus's
[2:36:25] [Music]
[2:36:28] origin. They failed to understand
[2:36:32] it. Vers 37, brother, put it
[2:36:36] absolutely. I know that ye are Abraham's
[2:36:38] seed, but ye seek to kill me because my
[2:36:41] word has no place in you.
[2:36:50] I interpret this directly. I speak that
[2:36:53] which I have seen with my
[2:36:57] father and ye do not do that which is
[2:37:01] and ye do that which is which ye have
[2:37:03] seen with your
[2:37:05] father. Now now Jesus is speaking to the
[2:37:08] Pharisees.
[2:37:11] Pharisees are the people who had
[2:37:12] believed in the word according to the to
[2:37:15] the revelation of their
[2:37:20] day by
[2:37:22] wisdom. But also they were natural. They
[2:37:26] were the seed of
[2:37:30] Abraham according to the natural
[2:37:34] birth. So they answered and said to
[2:37:37] Jesus, Abraham is our father.
[2:37:41] Jesus said unto them, "If ye were
[2:37:43] Abraham's
[2:37:45] children, ye would have done the works
[2:37:47] of
[2:37:48] Abraham, but now ye seek to kill me, a
[2:37:52] man that has told you the
[2:37:54] truth, which I have heard of
[2:37:57] God." Abraham didn't do this.
[2:38:02] Now, now listen friend, here is
[2:38:05] Jesus who according to these
[2:38:09] people, they do not fully understand the
[2:38:12] origin of this
[2:38:16] man. They think he was born out of
[2:38:21] wedlock. They think he was born out of
[2:38:24] confusion. Not too
[2:38:27] sure. But according to them, they knew
[2:38:31] they were coming from the lineage of
[2:38:35] Abraham. Friends, listen to me. Your
[2:38:40] natural
[2:38:41] lineage does not speak so much about
[2:38:44] you,
[2:38:47] but your spiritual lineage
[2:38:50] does. Hallelujah. We have a spiritual
[2:38:55] lineage. That is our true origin.
[2:39:00] Jesus is telling these people, you are
[2:39:03] not coming out of the lineage of Abraham
[2:39:06] as he
[2:39:08] claimed. But yet naturally they were
[2:39:12] coming from the lineage of
[2:39:14] [Music]
[2:39:15] Abraham. But he told them, you don't
[2:39:19] that's not your
[2:39:20] true. So in this
[2:39:24] discourse, we are going to see the Jews
[2:39:27] versus
[2:39:29] Jesus fighting for their true
[2:39:34] origin. Each claim, the other one is
[2:39:39] illegitimate. But who was
[2:39:42] right? Follow
[2:39:44] me. And they answered and said unto him,
[2:39:48] Abraham is our father.
[2:39:51] Jesus said unto them, "If ye were
[2:39:54] Abraham's
[2:39:55] children, ye would do the works of
[2:39:59] [Music]
[2:40:00] Abraham, but now you seek to kill
[2:40:03] me. A man that has told you the truth,
[2:40:06] which Abraham did not do
[2:40:10] this, you do the works of your father."
[2:40:15] Then they said to
[2:40:18] Jesus, the Jews now turn to
[2:40:21] Jesus and they tell him, "Hey, hey
[2:40:24] man, listen to us. We are not born out
[2:40:28] of
[2:40:29] fornication.
[2:40:32] Our father and mother married
[2:40:36] properly and we can trace ourselves back
[2:40:38] all the way to
[2:40:42] Abraham. Children of nowadays what are
[2:40:45] you talking about? Do you can you even
[2:40:48] present your lineage
[2:40:51] properly? We are telling you we are not
[2:40:54] born out of fornication.
[2:40:57] We have one
[2:40:58] father even
[2:41:00] God. Now they have claimed God as their
[2:41:04] father. They have no idea that God is
[2:41:07] standing right before
[2:41:11] them. Oh may God always open your eyes
[2:41:14] to see
[2:41:18] God. Look around you right now. There he
[2:41:22] is. Hallelujah. There he is.
[2:41:26] God is in your brother. God is in your
[2:41:29] sister. Don't be like the Pharisees.
[2:41:32] Open your eyes and see. Jesus Christ is
[2:41:36] the same
[2:41:38] today as he was
[2:41:41] then. Oh, may God open our
[2:41:44] eyes. And Jesus said unto them, "If God
[2:41:50] was your
[2:41:52] father, okay, you would love me.
[2:41:56] For I proceeded forth and I came out
[2:42:01] from God.
[2:42:07] Have you heard
[2:42:11] that? I came out of from
[2:42:14] God. Neither came I of
[2:42:17] myself, but he sent me. Who is talking?
[2:42:22] The
[2:42:23] son is
[2:42:25] talking. But where is the father? The
[2:42:28] father is in the son. The father and the
[2:42:31] son are
[2:42:33] one. Where is god? God is in you and you
[2:42:37] and him are
[2:42:39] one.
[2:42:41] Hallelujah. Why do you not understand my
[2:42:45] speech? Even because you cannot hear my
[2:42:51] word. That's how we can know even today
[2:42:55] the true seed of
[2:42:58] God. Don't be deceived. The true seed of
[2:43:01] God will believe the
[2:43:04] word. The one who is not will not. And
[2:43:08] when they don't receive the word, don't
[2:43:11] follow them because they are serpent
[2:43:13] seed.
[2:43:17] The seed of God will believe the word.
[2:43:21] You just follow me here. Just follow me
[2:43:23] here. You will see. Hallelujah.
[2:43:27] Hallelujah. Why do you not understand my
[2:43:29] speech?
[2:43:31] Even because you cannot hear my
[2:43:33] word. Uhhuh. Then now he opens the
[2:43:38] nuclear
[2:43:40] weapon and he shows them who they truly
[2:43:43] are.
[2:43:46] Do you want to see
[2:43:47] it? Ye are of your father the
[2:43:56] devil. People who came from the natural
[2:43:59] lineage of
[2:44:04] Abra Jesus just said their father is the
[2:44:08] devil. How come?
[2:44:13] Why is their origin now
[2:44:19] debated? It doesn't matter who your
[2:44:21] father naturally
[2:44:23] is. If you reject the word, you have
[2:44:26] shown your true
[2:44:29] color, whatever the word
[2:44:32] says, if you are a son of God, you will
[2:44:35] say,
[2:44:36] "Amen. Lord, help me to leave this
[2:44:38] world.
[2:44:42] But if you reject it, if you debate it,
[2:44:45] if you fast and walk away, you have just
[2:44:48] shown your true
[2:44:51] color. But right here, Jesus told them,
[2:44:56] what their true origin
[2:44:58] was and many of us know where to start
[2:45:02] from the
[2:45:04] garden. And the last of your father will
[2:45:07] do.
[2:45:10] He was a murderer from the
[2:45:12] beginning and he did not abide in the
[2:45:15] truth because there is no truth in him.
[2:45:19] When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of
[2:45:22] his own, for he is a liar and the father
[2:45:26] of
[2:45:27] it, but because I tell you the truth,
[2:45:30] you believe me not. Which of you
[2:45:33] convinces me of
[2:45:35] sin? And if I say the truth, why do you
[2:45:39] not believe me? He that is of God hearth
[2:45:43] God is
[2:45:44] what? He therefore hear them not because
[2:45:48] you are not of
[2:45:50] God. When Jesus said his word, he said,
[2:45:54] they swallowed. They swelled up swelled
[2:45:57] up like
[2:46:02] frogs and they began
[2:46:07] speaking and they
[2:46:10] said, "Say we not well that thou art a
[2:46:15] Samaritan?" If we say we are a
[2:46:17] Samaritan, are we not saying
[2:46:21] that? If we say that you are a
[2:46:23] Samaritan,
[2:46:28] They now calling Jesus a
[2:46:31] Samaritan. Read the Bible. You
[2:46:33] understand what this
[2:46:35] means.
[2:46:36] Samaritans were not an
[2:46:40] original
[2:46:43] race. It was
[2:46:46] mixed between the
[2:46:49] Jews and the Gentiles.
[2:46:53] And these
[2:46:54] people formed the
[2:46:59] Samaritans and the Samaritans were nonp
[2:47:05] Jews. Now they are calling Jesus a
[2:47:10] Samaritan. Because he has told them what
[2:47:13] they don't want
[2:47:15] to. The word will call you a
[2:47:17] Samaritan. The word will call you a car.
[2:47:20] The word will call you an audible.
[2:47:23] because they don't want to hear the
[2:47:25] truth you're telling them. Let them call
[2:47:27] us all they
[2:47:28] want. We know who we
[2:47:31] are. We are here. We stand. We stand on
[2:47:34] the word. We stand on baptism in Jesus
[2:47:37] name. We stand on one God. We stand on
[2:47:40] the rapture. We believe all these
[2:47:43] things. We believe in Malachi 4. God has
[2:47:47] sent a prophet in our generation. The
[2:47:50] seals are open. Let me tell you brother
[2:47:52] and sister they don't believe it but we
[2:47:55] believe it. They call us Samaritans.
[2:47:58] They call us
[2:48:01] false liars
[2:48:05] mixed. That doesn't change who we
[2:48:09] are. We are the sons of
[2:48:13] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. We are the
[2:48:16] sons of God. Come on young men. You need
[2:48:18] to be happy with that.
[2:48:21] We are the sons of
[2:48:23] Jonah. Hallelujah. Oh hallelujah. And
[2:48:27] then they continued and the way we are
[2:48:30] seeing you Jesus of Nazareth, you have a
[2:48:35] devil. The world will think you have a
[2:48:38] devil. You are
[2:48:40] possessed because you have simply
[2:48:45] asserted your true origin.
[2:48:50] And the world doesn't like you showing
[2:48:53] them their
[2:48:56] origin. If you preach like this, they
[2:49:00] will say you a judgment
[2:49:04] preacher. Don't judge
[2:49:06] us. Who are you to say I should not wear
[2:49:09] a
[2:49:12] pants? Pastor and so wears
[2:49:15] it. Even me I should wear
[2:49:20] them. Who are you to say not that wear
[2:49:22] skimpy
[2:49:25] dress? It doesn't matter what I
[2:49:28] wear. Leave me alone. Don't judge
[2:49:32] me. You a false
[2:49:34] preacher. You are in a car. You are
[2:49:38] deceived. That's what they told
[2:49:40] Jesus when he told them the truth.
[2:49:45] Brother, sister, open your
[2:49:48] eyes. And I want you to understand that.
[2:49:52] But even today, they will call you all
[2:49:54] sorts of things for standing with the
[2:49:59] word.
[2:50:01] Believers believe in abstaining until
[2:50:10] marriage. Do I have believers in
[2:50:12] div? Do I have younger people who who
[2:50:15] believe
[2:50:17] that abstaining until
[2:50:23] marriage and believers say
[2:50:27] amen? But the others, the true
[2:50:31] Samaritans who are calling you a
[2:50:33] Samaritan, they will say you are making
[2:50:35] yourself
[2:50:36] righteous. You think you're the only
[2:50:38] holy one. You think you're better than
[2:50:40] everybody else. Come on. I don't think I
[2:50:42] know I
[2:50:43] am because I know who I
[2:50:47] am. I'm not
[2:50:49] struggling to run away from such
[2:50:53] acts. I'm not
[2:50:56] struggling and I'm not struggling
[2:50:58] because I found a
[2:51:03] revelation. There is another
[2:51:06] nature. Amen. I'm drawing on it every
[2:51:09] day. And brother, sister, if you are
[2:51:13] here and you are struggling, don't
[2:51:17] pretend. Come on the altar. You don't
[2:51:20] have to do it right
[2:51:21] now. Do it every day until you get what
[2:51:26] I'm talking
[2:51:27] about. Because there is true
[2:51:30] experience. There is a true Holy Ghost.
[2:51:32] There's a true new birth. And when you
[2:51:35] receive it, it's a revelation of who you
[2:51:38] are.
[2:51:39] He will change you. He will change you.
[2:51:43] It's a power that
[2:51:44] changes. If you're too lazy to seek him,
[2:51:49] my friend, I can tell you for sure, you
[2:51:53] will not be too
[2:51:54] lazy. When that rapture
[2:51:57] happens, to be under
[2:52:00] persecution, when the judgments of God
[2:52:03] begin striking this world, you will not
[2:52:06] be too late then.
[2:52:08] You'll be up and about
[2:52:10] running seeing where you can get
[2:52:14] solace. All solace will be
[2:52:18] gone. Now you need to be sure of who you
[2:52:23] are. Yes, your name can be on a book and
[2:52:26] your name can be scrapped
[2:52:31] off. It is scary. That is a scary part.
[2:52:36] The name of Judas was on
[2:52:38] them. He came back and and Judas was
[2:52:42] with them. And Jesus told them, "Rejoice
[2:52:46] because your names are on the
[2:52:48] book. Not because you cast out demons,
[2:52:51] but because your names are on the
[2:52:53] book." But Judas's name was
[2:52:57] removed, became a son of
[2:52:59] pition because he rejected the word.
[2:53:02] Now friends, I know there is a section
[2:53:06] of those whose names are on the lamb's
[2:53:08] book of
[2:53:09] life that cannot be
[2:53:11] removed. I don't want to be overly
[2:53:14] confident and after all my name is on
[2:53:17] the lamb's
[2:53:19] section can't be removed. Let me do
[2:53:22] whatever I'm doing. Actually, you can't
[2:53:24] do whatever you're
[2:53:25] doing. If your name is on that
[2:53:28] section, I can assure you are not you
[2:53:30] are not wallowing in sin. Now,
[2:53:34] after hearing the
[2:53:36] word. But if you are in sin, your name
[2:53:39] may be on on the
[2:53:41] book, maybe not on that
[2:53:44] section and it can be
[2:53:47] removed. But I don't know where your
[2:53:49] name is. I'm preaching to a mixed group.
[2:53:53] All I can say make your calling and
[2:53:56] election
[2:53:57] [Music]
[2:53:57] [Applause]
[2:54:01] sure. Hallelujah.
[2:54:04] Versus 51. I want to try and finish
[2:54:07] now. Then say the Jews unto
[2:54:10] him. Now for saying these things you
[2:54:14] have
[2:54:15] said. You know Jesus, what did he say?
[2:54:18] He said I am I don't have a devil.
[2:54:22] I honor my father, but you dishonor
[2:54:25] me. Verily, I say unto you, if a man
[2:54:29] keep my
[2:54:31] saying, he shall never see
[2:54:34] death because the words of a son who is
[2:54:38] adopted is like unto the father's
[2:54:42] word. Amen. So then we see when the Jews
[2:54:47] heard that they said to
[2:54:49] him, okay, now we
[2:54:53] know, we are not doubting
[2:54:56] anymore. We know you have a
[2:54:59] devil, Abraham is
[2:55:03] dead and the
[2:55:06] prophets and thou
[2:55:08] sayest, if a man keep my
[2:55:15] They started mocking Jesus and you are
[2:55:19] saying if a man
[2:55:24] keep now we know you have a
[2:55:27] devil art thou greater than our father
[2:55:32] Abraham which is dead and the prophets
[2:55:35] which are dead whom thou makest thyself
[2:55:40] [Music]
[2:55:41] the world will ask
[2:55:43] You you are you
[2:55:46] better than everybody else? Are you
[2:55:49] better than all these
[2:55:50] pastors, all these big church, mega
[2:55:55] churches? Are you better than them? Whom
[2:55:58] do you call
[2:56:01] yourself? They asked the same question
[2:56:03] to
[2:56:05] Jesus. But how did he answer? The way he
[2:56:08] answered is the way I will answer.
[2:56:11] Let me see how he answered.
[2:56:14] Whom thou callst thyself?
[2:56:16] Jesus answered, "If I honor
[2:56:19] myself, if I honor
[2:56:22] myself, my honor is nothing. So I will
[2:56:25] tell them, if I honor
[2:56:28] myself, my honor is
[2:56:30] nothing as a
[2:56:33] man." Hallelujah. But there is another
[2:56:36] one that did not come from my mother and
[2:56:38] father.
[2:56:41] It is my
[2:56:42] father that honorth
[2:56:45] me of whom he say that he is your
[2:56:49] God. In other words, Jesus was telling
[2:56:53] them I don't honor myself as a human
[2:56:56] being but I do as a son of
[2:57:01] God. Hallelujah. Yet ye have not known
[2:57:05] him. You don't know my father. You don't
[2:57:09] know my father. Oh, hallelujah. If
[2:57:12] someone doubts your religion, tell them
[2:57:15] you don't know my father.
[2:57:17] You don't know what I believe because
[2:57:19] you don't know my father, but I know
[2:57:22] him. I know my father. Does anyone here
[2:57:26] know your
[2:57:28] father? Come on, shout it. I know my
[2:57:31] father. Do it again. Do it to God.
[2:57:35] [Music]
[2:57:38] I know my father. I know my father. And
[2:57:40] I can also say I know my
[2:57:43] father. I know my father. Hallelujah.
[2:57:46] Yes, sir. I know my father. And I keep
[2:57:51] saying hallelujah. Hallelujah. And I
[2:57:54] shall be a
[2:57:55] liar. If I told you, I don't know him.
[2:58:00] And
[2:58:02] then he said to them, "Your father whom
[2:58:07] you say is your father
[2:58:09] Abraham, you want me to tell you more
[2:58:12] about all right give me your
[2:58:14] ears
[2:58:18] you now natural
[2:58:21] father
[2:58:23] Abraham
[2:58:25] rejoiced to see my
[2:58:29] day and he saw it and was glad. My day.
[2:58:36] My
[2:58:36] day. This boy is not even 50 years
[2:58:40] old. The Jews
[2:58:43] were what? My day.
[2:58:48] Then said the Jews unto
[2:58:56] him, you are not even 50 years
[2:59:00] old and you have seen
[2:59:04] Abraham. He did not say you saw
[2:59:07] Abraham. He said Abraham saw
[2:59:11] his. The problem is people always
[2:59:14] misinterpret the
[2:59:16] word. Even now I can say I'm rejoice to
[2:59:20] see my
[2:59:22] day. My
[2:59:24] day he that is in me is greater than he
[2:59:27] that is in the
[2:59:29] world. Hallelujah. Oh my. We should get
[2:59:31] it. Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[2:59:34] verily, I say unto you, before Abraham
[2:59:41] was, I
[2:59:43] [Music]
[2:59:52] Where are the
[2:59:55] stones? Let us kill it. Let
[3:00:00] us
[3:00:02] bring this man. Can you imagine the man?
[3:00:06] He's
[3:00:09] blaspheming. They
[3:00:11] think the world
[3:00:13] thought he was worthy of death.
[3:00:17] But the world did not
[3:00:19] understand that he was speaking of his
[3:00:22] true
[3:00:25] image, his true
[3:00:28] origin. He was more than a
[3:00:30] man. Even today, the world can't
[3:00:33] understand who you
[3:00:35] are. Hallelujah. They don't understand
[3:00:39] who you are because they don't know your
[3:00:42] true
[3:00:43] name. They think
[3:00:47] But let me tell you, your true origin
[3:00:50] like Jesus is from above. Amen. You have
[3:00:54] no
[3:00:55] beginning. You have no
[3:00:59] end. Amen. You came from God. You go
[3:01:03] back to God. The true you is
[3:01:08] eternal. Amen. That's why the Bible says
[3:01:11] we are pass from death and life. Amen.
[3:01:15] There's only one source of life that is
[3:01:19] God's own life. Amen. Where we are now,
[3:01:23] we can no longer die. We have found
[3:01:26] where we came from. And that's who we
[3:01:28] are. And that's where we are. We are
[3:01:31] basking in the presence of the true
[3:01:36] God. By this message of the
[3:01:39] hour, the way to the tree of life,
[3:01:44] has been
[3:01:49] cleared. When the seals were
[3:01:53] opened, the way has been
[3:01:57] granted and he said Jesus is the way,
[3:02:00] the truth, and the life, but not the
[3:02:03] Jesus of the denomination.
[3:02:06] The
[3:02:07] word, you remember who is Jesus?
[3:02:10] The
[3:02:11] word is the way, the truth, and the
[3:02:15] life. And we have
[3:02:17] arrived. We are right
[3:02:19] here. We are eating the body of the son
[3:02:21] of
[3:02:23] Christ. We are born
[3:02:25] again, not of the incor of of the
[3:02:28] corruptible
[3:02:31] seed. But the seed which is
[3:02:35] incorrupt. And what has it
[3:02:38] done? He said
[3:02:41] it. It the open book. What happens?
[3:02:46] Prophesy
[3:02:47] again. What happens? Something happens
[3:02:50] all of a
[3:02:51] sudden. And you cannot speak your words
[3:02:54] anymore. You speak the words of
[3:02:59] God. And you are able to tell them, "My
[3:03:02] words is life." By the way, when you go
[3:03:04] out
[3:03:05] witnessing and they reject this word,
[3:03:08] they don't reject you. They've rejected
[3:03:13] God. Any son of God that is speaking
[3:03:17] under
[3:03:19] inspiration. Never ever
[3:03:22] ever
[3:03:23] blaspheme by turning it
[3:03:27] down. And then you begin abusing your
[3:03:30] spirit. man come up, preach the
[3:03:33] word, take it as God's word because
[3:03:37] there's only one thing that can never be
[3:03:39] forgiven. Blasphemy of the Holy
[3:03:42] Ghost. And where is he? He's in me. He's
[3:03:46] in you. He's in you. Every one of you
[3:03:50] who is born again. And when he speaks,
[3:03:54] when you speak, he speaks.
[3:03:58] The bride is him.
[3:04:00] We are the
[3:04:01] representation of Christ
[3:04:05] today. That's our true
[3:04:09] origin. That's just four pages out of
[3:04:12] 10. Let us stand our
[3:04:16] [Applause]
[3:04:26] feet. Musicians can please come.
[3:04:38] Friends, I'd like us to read more of the

[3:46:14] know that there are some who are
[3:46:15] wandering around,
[3:46:17] Lord, they're wondering what is
[3:46:19] happening,
[3:46:21] Lord. What kind of a power is this,
[3:46:23] Lord?
[3:46:25] Father, I ask you to reveal yourself,
[3:46:29] Father. Lord, I know
[3:46:31] Jesus for I was once in that position.
[3:46:34] Lord, I was once in that
[3:46:37] condition. I was just looking around,
[3:46:40] Lord, wondering what is
[3:46:42] happening. But Lord, I ask you, would
[3:46:44] you touch the wondering soul? Would you
[3:46:47] touch them, oh God? Father, let them
[3:46:50] know who you are. Let them understand
[3:46:52] who you are. Father, let them never be
[3:46:55] failures in the name of Jesus. Father,
[3:46:58] Lord, God, I ask you to stretch your
[3:46:59] hand towards them. I ask you, Lord, to
[3:47:02] have mercy upon them, Father. Lord, even
[3:47:06] their thoughts condemn them, Lord. Their
[3:47:08] own actions condemn, Lord. They feel so
[3:47:11] hopeless, Lord, Father. It looks like
[3:47:14] they're in an open space, oh God,
[3:47:16] Father. They're just wandering around,
[3:47:19] Lord, from corner to corner, Lord.
[3:47:21] Nowhere to go, Lord. Would you make
[3:47:23] yourself
[3:47:24] manifest? Would you be there, God? Oh,
