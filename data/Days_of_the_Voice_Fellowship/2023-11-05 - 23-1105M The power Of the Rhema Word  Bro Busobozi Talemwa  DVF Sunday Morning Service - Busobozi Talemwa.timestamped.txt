[1:32] in that's why when a preacher comes you
[1:36] pray and you wait upon
[1:37] God so when you now come to
[1:40] speak we pra we say Lord I now take
[1:43] myself out of the
[1:45] way follow me closely now I now take
[1:48] myself out of the why because I don't
[1:51] want to speak my
[1:53] mind I don't want to speak my
[1:56] thoughts I don't even just want to read
[1:58] to you the word
[2:01] but we want a
[2:05] word when that word
[2:07] comes many times you all sited there you
[2:11] can say many times people have said that
[2:13] was for
[2:17] me some people even come to me and say
[2:20] Pastor it was like as if you had put me
[2:23] there and you were speaking about
[2:28] me everything was
[2:32] about what was that that was the words
[2:35] of
[2:39] God from the
[2:42] supernatural god making
[2:45] alive God quickening That Word of
[2:49] Life to your
[2:51] heart that is what we
[2:54] need many times when a preacher is
[2:57] preaching don't just listen as if you
[3:00] are hearing a
[3:01] story don't just listen as if you know
[3:04] he's just telling Bible
[3:07] stories you know when you come to the
[3:10] service be prayed up be Desiring to hear
[3:13] from
[3:15] God did you hear what I said hearing
[3:17] from God how can you hear from God when
[3:20] man is
[3:21] speaking because the words I speak to
[3:24] you are not my words they are real my
[3:27] words of so when it
[3:30] by inspiration you C it by inspiration
[3:34] and quicken in your life when you
[3:36] believe it and you do what it says
[3:39] brings the
[3:41] results are you following me
[3:44] now brother bam says here now
[3:48] notice here it is I want you to see it
[3:51] and get it
[3:53] now the word of God written word of God
[3:55] will defeat sat
[3:58] anywhere
[4:01] any time it is
[4:03] written everybody wouldn't have
[4:08] gifts Jesus brought it down to a place
[4:10] where those who do not have gifts that
[4:13] do not have very much Faith could just
[4:15] say it is
[4:23] written that is now the
[4:27] log it is written
[4:30] tell your neighbor it is
[4:32] written all scripture is given by
[4:35] inspiration of
[4:39] God
[4:42] for for
[4:44] reproof for
[4:46] correction for
[4:48] instruction in righteous
[4:51] name now the written word is the
[4:55] absolute now I can speak to you words by
[4:59] inspiration
[5:03] the word is
[5:06] absolute everything else comes to
[5:10] that nothing can replace or improve on
[5:16] the it is God's words and therefore it
[5:19] is
[5:21] final but
[5:23] now here comes
[5:26] Jesus I told you that Jesus was the
[5:29] living
[5:32] word he himself was the
[5:35] lust but he was the Living
[5:39] Word how many understand it say
[5:42] Amen the
[5:44] word became
[5:47] flesh so now the word was
[5:52] working are you following me the word
[5:55] was
[5:56] working but the
[5:58] people we are still looking to the logos
[6:01] the written
[6:03] [Applause]
[6:06] word and they missed the word which was
[6:09] living and walking among
[6:13] them and they fig that many
[6:17] believers they look
[6:20] here to the written
[6:23] words and they failed to see the word in
[6:28] their
[6:30] but here when the word was in their
[6:33] midst here is what it
[6:36] spoke such here is what he
[6:39] himself John 539 such the
[6:43] scriptures for in such the
[6:46] scriptures which which scures talking
[6:49] about these ones the
[6:53] Bible search the
[6:55] scriptures for in
[6:57] them you think
[7:00] you have eternal
[7:03] life let me ask you child where was
[7:07] eternal
[7:10] life in
[7:12] their working in
[7:15] their but they failed to see
[7:18] life and they went to search the
[7:22] scriptures but they couldn't find
[7:24] life let me tell you CH when you miss
[7:28] RMA
[7:30] many times you will miss the written
[7:37] word two people shall be in the
[7:41] service say God spoke to
[7:44] me and another one will say those things
[7:47] were very
[7:49] difficult but yet they were all listen
[7:52] to
[7:54] the what is the nature of your
[7:58] heart
[8:00] and they search the scriptures in them
[8:02] you think you will have eternal
[8:05] life and they are they which testify of
[8:09] me and you will not come to
[8:12] me that you might have
[8:15] life so Jesus is insisting
[8:18] here that the written word in
[8:22] itself not give life the written word
[8:26] simply testifies of the Living Word
[8:36] the
[8:38] Jesus had the
[8:41] words
[8:43] the of eternal life if you understand
[8:47] that say
[8:48] Amen the of etal
[8:52] Life Jesus himself walking in their
[8:56] midst he had the words of eternal life
[8:59] but for them they were sticking with the
[9:01] written
[9:03] words they fail to seek God in their
[9:07] midst do you know that if Jesus was here
[9:11] today he would say the same things he
[9:15] said in his
[9:18] word let me ask you a
[9:20] question why do you think we come to
[9:24] church why don't we just stay at home
[9:26] and read the
[9:28] Bible
[9:30] why don't you just listen to the
[9:34] T because this
[9:36] word oh my I wish I wish you would see
[9:39] it this word has to come out of the
[9:43] pages of the
[9:46] Bible and when it is spoken to
[9:50] you then it brings
[9:52] life when it's spoken to you I can you
[9:56] can read sometimes one time I came here
[9:58] in the church
[10:00] and someone told me I you preached about
[10:02] the same thing I was
[10:05] [Applause]
[10:06] reading it it became life to me what is
[10:10] that they Reed the
[10:14] REM one comes to
[10:17] you quickens that life that seed of God
[10:21] in and the word of God makes sense to
[10:25] you Jesus Christ here in the Book of
[10:27] John 6 says
[10:31] then Jesus said unto the 12
[10:34] disciples will you also go
[10:37] away then Simon Peter answered
[10:40] him Lord to whom shall we
[10:45] go thou
[10:47] has the words of eternal
[10:51] life the
[10:54] REM the L simply testified of the person
[11:01] you know John 13 says the
[11:05] Word was
[11:07] God Jesus now had the words or rors of
[11:12] eternal
[11:15] life it doesn't matter how many times
[11:18] someone reads the logos
[11:23] word they had to
[11:26] hear the words that comes out of his
[11:31] those words now become the light of
[11:35] men those words now become
[11:38] life now let me give you another
[11:42] example these people had read for
[11:44] thousands of
[11:50] years the book of Isaiah which we read
[11:52] here many
[11:54] times
[11:57] 61 which says
[12:00] the spirit of the Lord is upon
[12:02] me because the Lord has anointed me to
[12:05] preach Good Tidings unto the
[12:08] me he sent me to bind up the broken
[12:12] heart to Proclaim Liberty to the
[12:16] captives and the opening of the prison
[12:18] to them that
[12:20] abound to proclaim the acceptable year
[12:23] of the
[12:25] lord I want you to now cut yourself from
[12:28] here
[12:29] [Music]
[12:30] and take
[12:32] yourself in the days before Jesus
[12:37] came I don't know which that
[12:39] was so let's say we are all now
[12:44] there prophet Isaiah has
[12:47] prophesied and these words are put on on
[12:50] the pages of the
[12:55] word the word which came out of God and
[12:59] it was
[13:00] written
[13:02] now these words have been
[13:05] read read many
[13:07] times over and over over and
[13:11] over but it did not make any
[13:15] sense until Jesus
[13:17] came when Jesus came on
[13:20] the he read the same
[13:23] word but this time he preached
[13:27] it he spoke it he Ed it and then he said
[13:33] this this scripture this day this
[13:37] scripture is fulfilled in your
[13:40] ears are you hearing meaning this is no
[13:43] longer just
[13:45] L now the spoken
[13:48] word and when the word is spoken it must
[13:52] come to
[13:53] life Jesus said this day this scripture
[13:57] fulfilled in your ears meaning now I
[13:59] have Ed it to
[14:01] you is just no longer
[14:03] written I have taken it out of the pages
[14:06] of the
[14:08] world and have given it to your
[14:11] ears listen even when it came in their
[14:15] ears only those that had the heart
[14:18] receive
[14:20] it it came fulfilled to them but to
[14:24] others they still saw Jesus the son of
[14:28] the C
[14:30] but yet here he was
[14:32] Jesus the word made
[14:36] manifest
[14:38] Revelation inspiration and when you
[14:41] receive the
[14:43] word it comes to
[14:45] life in your own life
[14:49] hallelujah amen amen praise God when I'm
[14:54] preaching let me give another
[14:57] example I know right now I'm just going
[15:00] all over the place maybe I'll have to do
[15:02] this again so that I can uh take you a
[15:04] little bit deeper
[15:05] now here came
[15:09] Peter and Peter was uh speaking to a
[15:13] group of
[15:16] people who did not have the Holy
[15:20] Spirit these people were in the house of
[15:24] coreli and they did not have the Holy
[15:26] Spirit and Peter came
[15:30] and because the angel of the Lord
[15:31] visited him and told him go speak to
[15:33] those
[15:35] people and those people the angel of
[15:39] Lord also visited
[15:41] them and they said go call
[15:45] Peter there is something I want you to
[15:48] say please put your thoughts together
[15:50] here
[15:51] now he says go call
[15:57] Peter speak to us want to hear your word
[16:02] he says go call
[16:04] Peter to come and speak to
[16:08] you why because the word of
[16:14] God comes to
[16:16] life when it is
[16:19] spoken to a heart that is
[16:23] desired and these people were
[16:26] waiting they were waiting they were
[16:28] waiting and when Peter came he began
[16:31] preaching to them he was preaching
[16:33] Christ he was preaching Christ and then
[16:36] the Bible says the Holy Spirit came and
[16:40] fell upon those that heard the
[16:44] word you see that's why the gospel
[16:47] cannot be transported in any other
[16:51] way some people are saying we should
[16:53] only press
[16:55] play others are saying that you should
[16:57] only read the
[17:00] are saying many things but let me tell
[17:02] you the only way God transports the
[17:06] gospel it's by preaching the
[17:08] gospel by speaking the gospel when the
[17:12] gospel is
[17:13] spoken life comes and you amen even
[17:17] right now as you are hearing when you
[17:19] hear the word the word even if you feel
[17:23] it if you don't feel it this word amen
[17:27] begins to do work within your
[17:30] soul inside your soul there is a seed
[17:35] there is a jam of
[17:37] life that is
[17:39] dant but when the word comes
[17:42] upon the word that is
[17:45] spoken that Worden quickens
[17:49] it and begins to come to
[17:52] life imagine the people who were there
[17:55] and you know the preacher was preaching
[18:00] maybe they are
[18:02] quiet and then all of the sudden the
[18:05] power of the Holy Ghost come and they
[18:07] started
[18:09] speaking why do you think many
[18:11] times when you are feeling
[18:13] bad and then you begin hearing the
[18:16] word life begins to
[18:18] come you begin to feel better
[18:24] and what is that the word of God
[18:28] quickening
[18:32] that Peter and and and and
[18:38] ethopian they were in in The
[18:41] Chariot you know going and Philip came
[18:44] and told them the
[18:47] UN do you understand what things you're
[18:50] reading do you understand the
[18:56] L and and and uh
[18:59] the UN
[19:00] said how can I
[19:03] understand without an
[19:06] interpreter do you know how the Holy
[19:08] Spirit interprets his
[19:10] word through the
[19:15] word by being by the word being spoken
[19:17] to
[19:18] you and the word bringing that
[19:21] life so now the Bible says that this man
[19:27] Philip on that very scripture in the Old
[19:31] Testament what did he do to speak about
[19:37] Jesus the only thing you did was to
[19:40] speak Hallelujah the only thing you need
[19:43] is to be honor the spoken
[19:45] word is to hear the word being
[19:49] spoken and and and you know while he was
[19:52] hearing while he was heing as they were
[19:55] going that seed of of God in his heart
[19:59] was receiving life receiving life
[20:02] receiving life the more he had the more
[20:06] life came in the more
[20:08] he Hallelujah the more life came in and
[20:12] then when he saw water he did not wait
[20:15] for Peter to tell him rather for Philip
[20:18] to tell him come I baptize you when he
[20:20] saw water that jam of life in him had
[20:25] already received the
[20:27] word already known I need to be baptized
[20:31] immediately say here is water baptize me
[20:36] who told him the power of the
[20:40] real there is power in the spoken
[20:44] word
[20:46] hallelujah
[20:48] hallelujah oh
[20:50] my many
[20:52] times when I meet people for
[20:56] counseling some times as as a preacher
[20:59] you don't know you know this some
[21:01] situations sometimes are very
[21:04] hard very difficult and you meeting
[21:08] someone and and you know you are
[21:09] juggling to find out how to advise
[21:13] them and then you will maybe go to the
[21:16] logos
[21:17] work begin to read to them and then then
[21:21] then you put it aside you begin to to
[21:24] speak to them you speak you speak
[21:29] and while you as you are
[21:31] speaking this has happened to me many
[21:34] times the power of the Holy Ghost gives
[21:37] me
[21:40] REM and I begin speaking to the person
[21:44] directly it's not my thoughts it may not
[21:47] even be written anywhere in the Bible
[21:49] but it is the word for that moment for
[21:53] you let me tell you every believer needs
[21:57] that and that's why even we need that
[21:59] kind of
[22:01] preaching we don't come to church just
[22:04] for someone to read us the
[22:05] Bible or to give us the knowledge of the
[22:08] Bible we want that
[22:11] Spirit which wrote the
[22:13] Bible when that spirit of God comes down
[22:17] he takes the written word and puts life
[22:21] on them and then when you receive it
[22:25] as amen it works in your life
[22:29] and brings the
[22:31] result praise
[22:34] God hallelujah hallelujah one time I was
[22:37] speaking with a sister in
[22:40] Ethiopia and she was completely
[22:44] devastated she did not know what to do
[22:46] next and she told me
[22:49] Pastor if God doesn't do
[22:52] something I'm going for sure I don't
[22:54] know why I should
[22:56] ser
[22:59] ah when I heard that it smart my
[23:03] heart it smart my heart I felt so
[23:10] bad I really felt so it was speaking to
[23:14] her speaking to her and you know as I
[23:19] was
[23:21] speaking the ho Spirit came down and I
[23:25] began saying to her sister
[23:28] you're going to get a
[23:31] job in a very short time if it doesn't
[23:34] happen then I'm a false
[23:37] prophet now that did not come from
[23:40] me at that moment it
[23:45] was spoken for that
[23:48] moment if the sister would have said
[23:51] no been up to her but she received one
[23:56] thing I love about Ethiopian people
[23:58] they receive the
[24:01] word they're not like ugandans are not
[24:05] so but Ethiopians are better when the
[24:09] word is
[24:10] spoken
[24:11] amen amen I believe we need to do that
[24:15] also we need to do that you need to
[24:18] discern that moment when God is speaking
[24:21] to
[24:24] you one time brother bham was speaking
[24:28] and sister right brother had come from
[24:31] the
[24:33] squirrel and God had created squ three
[24:36] of
[24:37] them and so brother bam was telling the
[24:42] story had
[24:44] that and when she did she said
[24:48] Amen brother that is nothing but the
[24:54] truth
[24:55] amen ah God was happy
[24:59] and the word came
[25:02] out
[25:04] her right now speak ask anything you
[25:09] want oh my God I want such
[25:12] moments ask anything you want that is
[25:16] not written anywhere in the
[25:17] SC but you see it came at that
[25:21] moment a spoken word of
[25:25] God if it is a spoken word
[25:29] it carries the same weight that this one
[25:33] carries and it cannot
[25:35] fail just like this one cannot
[25:38] fail what is that it comes by the
[25:42] spirit which gives
[25:45] life if sister would have
[25:48] said
[25:49] brother where is that one
[25:55] written but brother bham said
[25:58] even if she had asked for $1
[26:01] million it would have been there right
[26:05] away even if she had wanted
[26:08] anything she says I want a
[26:14] limosine hallelujah hallelujah amen
[26:18] hallelujah amen what what created the
[26:21] world the word amen what the Bible says
[26:25] there is nothing that is created that
[26:27] was created without the
[26:30] word and that same spoken word has the
[26:33] same power
[26:36] today that's why we should be people who
[26:39] believe
[26:40] that when a preacher is preaching many
[26:43] times we don't speak even the written
[26:46] word many times it is the remers of
[26:50] God spoken out to
[26:52] you when you when you hear it don't be D
[26:56] and receive it accept
[26:59] it but some people they are D to receive
[27:03] it but do you know what God loves want
[27:06] people who just come and snatch
[27:10] it amen I believe it and the sister said
[27:17] amen sister she said
[27:21] amen I just said you are going to
[27:23] receive a
[27:24] job in not many days sayth the Lord and
[27:29] she
[27:30] said two
[27:32] weeks they asked her how much do you
[27:35] want
[27:37] to she's the one who
[27:44] spoke if they tell you how much do you
[27:46] want to
[27:47] ear how much will you
[27:49] say that's what she
[27:52] said that's what she
[27:54] said whatever she thought was big
[27:59] and they told
[28:02] [Music]
[28:03] that Hallelujah now always when you come
[28:06] to
[28:08] church be sit on the edge of your
[28:12] seat when the word is being
[28:16] prern what is God speaking to
[28:19] me what is for me what is mine what is
[28:23] the REM of
[28:24] God
[28:26] to hear it you accept it you believe it
[28:31] it must
[28:32] happen it must happen but the problem
[28:36] many Believers don't
[28:39] believe or they hear but they don't
[28:42] agree but always snatch that
[28:46] word are you hearing me the power of the
[28:52] r when it comes to when when Jesus says
[28:57] my words are
[28:59] life which words do you think is talking
[29:03] about
[29:05] hey hallelujah amen what do you think is
[29:08] talking about
[29:09] [Applause]
[29:14] this some people
[29:16] think that when you teach the
[29:19] word and when you understand everything
[29:21] in
[29:22] here you are going to have eternal
[29:26] life M that's a big
[29:30] mistake listen carefully when he says my
[29:34] words are
[29:36] life he did not mean the logos
[29:40] word because it says the
[29:44] letter the spirit gives
[29:47] life so he's talking about
[29:53] the the son the children of God will
[29:55] always receive the REM
[29:59] everybody can
[30:03] read and they all do and they all
[30:07] interpret it in their own
[30:09] way a son a daughter of God always he
[30:16] the not their own
[30:20] interpretation even the Devil Himself he
[30:24] knows the L
[30:25] word he can even read
[30:28] it one time he was quoting it to
[30:31] Jesus it is written it is written it is
[30:35] written but when Jesus came you know
[30:38] what did he say he says amen man shall
[30:42] not live by bread
[30:45] alone but by every
[30:47] word what word not the one
[30:52] you no not the one
[30:55] youting every
[30:58] that comes out of the mouth
[31:01] of Hallelujah the children of God must
[31:05] have more than the written
[31:07] word not something different something
[31:10] that makes the written word alive in our
[31:17] lives the devil can read this
[31:20] on but he will not understand that is
[31:23] why when he when he came to Jesus he was
[31:27] asking him if you be the Son of
[31:30] God if you be the Son of God cast
[31:33] yourself
[31:34] down it is written but listen the Bible
[31:39] tells
[31:40] me oh my God oh my God listen Jesus when
[31:45] he was
[31:46] baptized he went up straight away out of
[31:48] the
[31:49] water listen
[31:53] and the heavens were open
[31:58] are you are you
[31:59] following and he saw the spirit of
[32:04] God descending like
[32:07] a and lighting upon him and a
[32:13] voice the spirit of God the voice the
[32:18] words and a voice from
[32:21] Heaven saying this is my beloved
[32:26] Son
[32:27] I am well
[32:28] pleased in whom I am well pleased let me
[32:32] ask you where was the devil when these
[32:34] words were
[32:39] spoken yet he came back around and he
[32:42] said if you be the Son of
[32:45] God he didn't have a revelation of
[32:50] the Hallelujah it was already
[32:54] spoken but he didn't understand but a
[32:57] true child of God a believe of the word
[33:00] will always receive a spoken
[33:03] word the spoken word is the original
[33:07] SE spoken word weakens your life and
[33:12] reveals Jesus to you
[33:17] personally the devil can
[33:20] Theos but he will remain
[33:23] dead nothing in there to Quicken it it
[33:27] takes the to Quicken the
[33:32] seed many can actually quote and many
[33:34] can
[33:36] preach but I'm afraid many people preach
[33:38] the
[33:41] logos that's why you see you can read
[33:45] properly and then you come and preach to
[33:47] us what you
[33:50] read but you know there are two types of
[33:53] preaching the first type of
[33:55] preaching is when you are lecturing to
[34:01] us you are lecturing to us you are just
[34:05] like a
[34:06] student goes to school and is
[34:10] taught the law of
[34:15] motion and you come back
[34:17] here they say you student
[34:21] come tell your friends what you have
[34:24] learned and then you begin
[34:27] the law of
[34:29] motion the law of
[34:32] motion everything you know is
[34:34] remembering what he
[34:36] learned and sometimes he can
[34:39] forget wait oh it says like this who
[34:44] knows the law of
[34:46] motion who can set it come and set
[34:52] the the law of
[34:55] motion the law of motion states
[35:00] that a body tends to continue
[35:05] in in
[35:10] Motionless acted upon by an external
[35:13] Force unless
[35:25] upon
[35:27] he learned that from
[35:30] school and today we have a lot of
[35:33] preachers who are preachers of the
[35:38] law they went to Bible
[35:41] school and what they taugh them is what
[35:43] they are coming to tell
[35:45] you but how does God call his
[35:48] preachers rather God comes and calls you
[35:52] by
[35:53] fire and when you come you are going to
[35:56] stand like
[35:58] fire it will not be your words
[36:01] you not amen hallelujah amen Paul said
[36:04] this he said the words I speak to you
[36:08] are not learned from Bible
[36:10] College it is not from man's
[36:13] Wisdom by the by the power of the Holy
[36:16] Ghost you know he was speaking the remas
[36:19] of
[36:20] God that is what brings
[36:23] life amen amen when the word of God Is
[36:27] Spoken the spoken word brings
[36:30] life that's why when a preacher speaking
[36:34] the remers of God is for your life you
[36:37] feel like jumping you feel like amen
[36:41] shouting you feel like claing you feel
[36:44] so good what is that it is the power of
[36:47] God the fire of God that follow the REM
[36:52] word and let me tell you when you
[36:55] receive the Rema word for you
[36:57] don't stay in your
[36:59] seat don't stay in your
[37:01] seat you are free to jump you free to
[37:04] clap your hands to
[37:07] shout Amen to be
[37:11] liberated that is why we are called
[37:15] Pentecostal
[37:17] Pentecostal means people of the
[37:21] spirit it's not people who are
[37:25] stagnated
[37:27] they have the letter but they have no
[37:29] Spirit we are people of the
[37:34] spirit
[37:36] amen you cannot separate emotion from
[37:40] the
[37:43] word it is
[37:45] impossible whever the word
[37:49] spoken brings an
[37:54] emotion praise God
[37:58] you
[37:59] see the M the word which comes out of
[38:01] the mouth of
[38:03] God how B when the spirit of Truth is
[38:07] come he will guide you into all
[38:10] truth he shall not speak of
[38:12] himself but whatsoever you shall hear
[38:15] that he shall
[38:16] speak he will show you things to
[38:19] come the only spirit makes the word or
[38:21] the logos come to
[38:25] life
[38:27] people people who only have the
[38:32] logos without the spirit
[38:35] thereof they
[38:38] dead someone will come and ask
[38:41] you show me in the
[38:44] word where it says I should never
[38:50] drink show me in the word where it says
[38:54] I should not Mar more
[38:55] than
[38:59] it should
[39:04] be and then you are forced to be
[39:10] pulled such foolish
[39:13] talk but to you who has REM
[39:17] word you when you read these things you
[39:21] see more than what is
[39:23] there when you hear these things you
[39:26] hear more than is written you understand
[39:29] more than is
[39:30] written there many things we do as
[39:35] believers do you know the Bible says
[39:38] that when you receive the law of the
[39:40] spirit of Life In
[39:43] Christ you are no longer under the law
[39:46] of sin and
[39:48] death you are no longer under the law
[39:50] thou sh not thou sh
[39:54] not you don't need any
[39:58] to tell you do this do this don't do
[40:01] that you don't need those laws anymore
[40:04] why you have received the spirit of
[40:07] life that has quickened your
[40:10] soul that Holy
[40:12] Ghost will not allow you to drink beer
[40:16] anymore that Holy Ghost in you will not
[40:19] allow you to go in
[40:21] this that Holy Ghost will take you away
[40:27] that Spirit of life will Quicken
[40:31] you and give you new
[40:33] desires I give you new life and give you
[40:37] and change your mind you will think
[40:41] different why because you keep
[40:44] hearing another voice you always hear
[40:47] the
[40:50] REM hallelujah hallelujah sometimes when
[40:52] I preach here the preacher can say God
[40:56] bless
[40:57] and then someone go
[41:01] crazy they had another
[41:05] word the Holy Spirit made it real to
[41:09] them them and attached to their
[41:13] life you you had God bless you but God
[41:17] spoke to them maybe the devil was
[41:20] telling them that they are not blessed
[41:22] and they will not make it and that that
[41:25] at that moment when the preer says God
[41:27] bless you the holy spirit will make
[41:31] it you are blessed you are blessed you
[41:35] are not going to
[41:36] fall you are blessed they will hear
[41:39] something else and why can it not bring
[41:43] excitement there is a power in
[41:48] the he will show you things to
[41:51] come you don't need to hear anybody say
[41:53] it he will guide you into all truth
[41:57] he would he would tell you what not to
[41:58] do and what to
[42:00] do the Holy
[42:03] Spirit praise God it may be written or
[42:07] Unwritten let me prove that for just a
[42:10] moment Luke
