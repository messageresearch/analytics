you can help me I'd like to greet everyone uh today in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ at least for the preaching session if all of you can come this side on these two uh so that we can be able to see each other and be able to follow each other pretty well amen praise the Lord tell your neighbor thank you for coming in the house of the Lord amen ah is that doas you're not you're not greeting anyone you're welcome you're welcome I'm happy to see you and I'm happy to see sister Ruth walking with without anything to help you isn't the Lord good amen amen we thank God hallelujah our god is a Healer uh this evening I do not know is there anybody yeah sometimes I think we can even do without interpretation but when you ask like that people don't raise their hands and then when they go out there you hear them talking it is better with interpretation yeah so some people can hear English but they hear better with interpretation I'm happy to see every one of you this amen clap for the Lord to allow you it's a blessing uh I've been having this on my heart for a long long time but I've been waiting for the for the right opportunity I believe there is always a season a season a season uh I'll just say a few remarks before we go to the word by God's grace I have been opportuned to I don't know if that's the right word to uh be in starting congregations from nothing you see two people becoming three becoming four 5 10 20 30 40 I've seen that happen and uh here at dvf is the I can say maybe the third time I have seen it happening and um the second time where I have been the one you know to lead the flock the first being inis Ababa but one thing I can say the difference uh between a church that begins from scratch and a church that begins by separating from another church is um when a church begins from scratch everything is organic uh I don't know if the yes there is no plastic thing if someone doesn't know how to pray they don't know how to pray and they they want to know how to and they want to know so they will hear you teach them a person who does not have the Holy Spirit will be I don't have the Holy Spirit and they want to get the Holy Spirit but the when a church breaks a way and they start a church it becomes difficult because everybody thinks they know and so when you teach something they will not take it in easily um if you notice brother bham was usually going to um churches of so-called Believers or Christians [Music] but the gift that he had that was operating through his ministry did not operate as such to a greater magnitude the reason was because these Christians they think they know much and so they becomes touchy they become cold sometimes they become larm and so it is difficult to break through them it takes a long time you have toach conv but you see when he came to Africa in South Africa to be precise there was a Revival there was a Revival and he said those people most of them were of course black people but you see most of them were just like what you would call nonbelievers and others denominational people like Catholics they were just hungry for God and when they see something they believe it to be of God and God used them in a mighty mighty way in such a way that they re received it whatever God was doing they were receiv and many of them were healed by thousands they CED crutches of people who were lame you know by thousands wheelchairs but people who were healed they were not even touched but because they they saw someone being healed they saw a little designment here and they believe it and they they all receive it and they were all here but you see with Believers it becomes a bit difficult and um and um you know in Believers churches each Pastor has a direction that God has given him a Grace of ministry and so when someone has already been a Believer when they come join a new church it takes some time for you to for them to sink into that new ministry and so the reason I say those things is because I've been there when you know churches just begin and I know that everything happens in phases and um and I'm seeing that happening in our little Fellowship here um I feel that this is the time this is the season where we many of you are catching the vision the vision of this ministry the vision of the message we have and I feel it's the right time for us to now start our overnight um some people thought I don't believe in it I believe in it I've always believed in it uh but I believe in the leadership of the Holy Spirit it's not a a a man or a group of men to lead the church go tells me pass there and it is difficult for me to pass there I will not question him I'll just pass them I'll just pass and so at this time it doesn't matter whether personally I'm cuz now I was wondering I was just talking to God and was telling asking him a few questions do you want me to be like to lose all my strength why are you bringing Revelations to me that uh taking away all my strength because I'm noticing these days I preach at least four day four times a week because of the inspiration we had of the home s and uh I thought I would not even go to any home sale but somehow it's been working itself out and then now we have overnight and other services but I realize it's not about me it's about God and whatever he says we obey and follow amen and thank you for coming um that means you're supporting the vision and I believe that God is going to bless you immensely there's been some wonderful testimonies uh from the home sales brother brother martin can you come and and give that testimony I think is just a wonderful testimony come and give it before I start preaching I'm telling you when I heard it I was amazed God is going to wonderful things you just wait and see us whatever the Lord tells us to do let us do it amen amen yeah God bless you sa good evening amen yeah yesterday God gave us a very wonderful time at our place last Saturday I was just sitting near home outside the gate yeah okay my kids that pissed me off I say let me just have my free time alone so when I was seated outside two ladies were bypassing ladies yeah so one knew me and then she said do you have somewhere to share with us yeah we are going to meet to visit our friend sure you're welcome so we started sharing uh for something like 30 minutes and then this lady was even she was welcoming others come on listen come on the word so there are like three of them one Catholic another one is is in between is a religious person then one is a Pentecostal yeah so I also told them that by the way every Thursday we have a home sale here if you don't mind yeah you come and we have some so she also told me oh Thursday I don't know what to do because when us on Thursday we also have home but she told me now ours start earlier so uh if you don't mind you come our side we also come to your yeah so yesterday I remembered and I I gave her a call so she told me yeah you come we going to start so I told my home people prepare yeah I may take some 20 minutes maybe when I'm away so I left at home when my wife had already uh organized so when I reached there I found when they had not organized themselves so I told them I don't have 15 minutes yeah so they arranged very fast so we sat outside so when we after sitting uh that lady told me that do you know what you're the one who's going to share with us so it was also surprise okay no problem so we started sharing we started when we were three the fourth person came the fifth came up to the nth and all there are elderly people with only one young man so we shared I gave them a full dose pure one so they started asking questions ah we have never had things like this I told her this is a real Bible so we are sharing about Rec organizing your day you are message so told them in the days we living in there is a message so by before even I finished one told me that I have a question what can I do if I want to be baptized in the right way I told them you don't even need to to pay a penny if you ready any time we shall bapti so they told me even on Saturday come again so for them they have like three times a week so even tomorrow they requested me to go and share with them I told them I have full package told them we have if you I so I just gave them like a hint I told them we okay they told me okay we are going to because there's a lady who told me that but but no but Jesus is the one who said about the baptism why do you is okay let us go and Trace you have anywhere where anybody was baptized in Trinity I don't have but Jesus said so so by the time we finish she had no question so we thank God for that and God willing tomorrow they told me I'm wellcome as long as I feel like going there so I just pray that uh you pray for that yeah God willing one of these days uh since they told they're going to tell others they're going to invite their friends and the friends also maybe their so if they do so through your prayers I will also need to take [Music] the yeah because everybody there how God designed yeah I've really I've always I'm one person I've always enjoyed the way uh the way God uses Pastor to package the word most especially when it comes to the message of the hour yeah so let us pray about it yeah you never know maybe it may even be tomorrow bless amen and that's not all there is also something going on in uh it all started uh with where is Sister Ruth is she inside here I can't see her she stepped out uhuh that's why I told uhhuh I was not seeing you because of this pillar that's why I requested the people who are this side to come see this side started with sister Ruth one time here in the in the service um she gave um a message in tongues and the interpretation and was calling out several names of several brothers who are ministering who are starting up in Ministry I don't know how many remember that and the message was position yourself now sometimes messages come like that and you do not everybody will interpret it their own but if the message is yours you can never understand even The Giver cannot understand but the one given will understand if it is from the Lord and so um later on sham and his wife came to me regarding that message and um you know when the message came out um the the wife of Shem thought something and shame also thought something and and they came together later on so what do you think about that message and each of them was thinking about it the same way about what the Lord had told them about where they live and what they're supposed to do and and it's a long story but um so they came to me spoke to me and we prayed together um felt that the something the Lord wanted them to do as far as Ministry is concerned and um so uh we just prayed together advis them and then they left so I think after a while Shem tells me he had seen um uh I think a dream regarding a certain denominational church and this denominational Church they he they went there and they were received and later on he also welcomed me there and these people according to the dream received the message and even the pastor was saying now I can no longer preach but the point is this that that place that specific place he did not know any church there and so he kept on asking uh what do you think it meant because I see no church in that area and I kept on asking did you see it every week I've been asking did you finally see the church I mean it's like you seeing in a vision or in a dream a church just here and you know there is no church here and so we've been trying to find a place where they can be gathering and meeting the other friends who want to also hear the message but you see according to the dream he was like okay now these people have believed we don't we don't even need a place anymore and so uh this pastor comes up and um you know believes the message anyways so that was the dream how long ago is it 2 3 weeks ago two months ago yeah two months ago and so recent I think it also happened this week it called me very excited say can you imagine I have seen the place I have seen the church at the exact place and and so he walked in there and the people received him as he had seen and the reason why he had not seen the church is because it's like some kind of Institution and so they have like a chapel there and so um and they're very receptive and um I wanted you to hear the testimony of Martin also hear this because I want you to pray God is up to something God is up to something this Gospel of the Kingdom should reach up to the uttermost parts everywhere when you hear the sister Esther was telling me also brother Marvin were informing me because brother Marvin has been going there to minister every and that they are saying that now the questions are too many I think brother Marin you had to run away one of the of the days when it had gotten Sol the people are coming at the home of es they hearing the message but been preaching and they asking questions and they are not yet satisfied they want more I tell you what we have is gone and therefore I believe the the grace that God has given to us and is giving to us to take it let's do it but remember we cannot be able to penetrate without prayer and so it is appropriate that at this time we begin our overnight prayers not 20 minutes of prayer 30 minutes of prayer several hours of prayer and before we do that I I would like us to go into the scriptures if you can stand we go to the Book of Revelations chapter 3 vers 15 amen we are up for a wonderful night tonight so those ones who have been planning to sleep forget about it of course you won't even have time to do it amen chapter 3: 15 and I'm I'm reading in the name of the Lord Jesus I'll begin from 14 and unto the angel of the Church of the Lans write these things sayith the amen the faithful and the true and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would I would thou wor cold or hot so then because Thou Art larm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth [Music] because thou sayest I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I Cel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with thyself that thou mayest see amen as many as I love I rebuke and chest be zealous therefore and [Music] repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he will with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I overcame even I even I also over even as I also overcame and I'm set down with my father in his throne he that has an hear Let Him hear what the spirit saith unto the chch you may be seated so Brethren this evening um the subject I I have I don't even know whether I will touch it ingredients of [Music] Revival that's what I want to talk about um you know what we are doing is not easy it's a sacrifice serving God is not easy it is a sacrifice you believe that don't you and so don't be Weare in doing well doing good in due time you shall be rewarded the Bible says I stand at the door and and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and S with him and he with me the reason why I started with this scripture is to show you where Jesus is in our generation he is outside of the people's hearts has rejected him if you notice all other Generations they never rejected him they had they accepted him but they had some elements among them that were not good but laia is very cunning stubborn this is a generation speaking ofia whatever call this is a generation that actually has many Christians professing Christians but it is the most hypocritical age whereby people are very many in church but do of the word are very few until Jesus himself has complained and he has said you've kicked me out of your hearts I stand at the door I am outside of your heart but I'm on the door of your heart and I am knocking he a personal affair you see we are Gentiles and we are not going to worship God like the Jews do to the Jews he comes to them as a nation to us he comes to us as individuals we must be ready to work our salvation with fear and trembling you must have a desire for God as an individual whether your parents are believers or not whether you have a brother as a Believer or sister a Believer or not or whether your husband or wife is a Believer or not brother sister listen you must find God as an individual because this generation ofia has kicked out Jesus but now remember they have not rejected him outright but Jesus is the one complaining that they have kicked him out but for them they are calling themselves believers they are worshiping they are praying they they in churches but Jesus is saying I am on the outside I want to say even believe of this message they have intellectually accepted the word but in their life they have kicked out Jesus in our life we have kicked him out if I ask you a question is he in your life is he how do you know he is if he is in your lifestyle if the life you are living is worthy of the Gospel if Jesus was to come tonight you would be ready to go then you know he is in your heart but Jesus is not happy with our because they kicked him out by their life they have rejected him and Jesus Jesus you know has sent the message to the messenger and he said I know your works I know your works you are not called so now what does called mean called is somebody who has low spiritual temperatures someone who rejects God someone rejects his word outright someone who even says I am an arist someone who says these things of the Bible don't tell me someone who says I am an alcoholic I'm a smoker don't tell me about God that is a cold woman a cold man that is why they can do things until you wonder they are coldhearted they don't fear God their God is their Bell as long as they have what they're doing is going to give them money they will kill they will steal they will fornicate they will commit a they will do anything as long as it satisfies them you know that is a cold person cold hearted but now toan Christians God is saying you are not called but also he says you are not hot because who is a hot Christian someone who is on fire someone you don't need to ask whether they are a Believer or not you know they are a believer by the life they live you know they are a Believer by the friends they keep by the friends they keep you know they are Believer by the friends they cut away from themselves the way they walk the way they dress the way they believe you know you know they are a Believer because of their convictions by the music they listen to you know you cannot even ask yourself is there is he a Believer who is you know no no no you already know by seeing them or by talking to them one minute but in our generation Jesus is complaining he is saying you are not cold you are not hot and is not happy at all and he's saying I wish you were cold or hot and he continues on so then because you are larm because you are lukewarm now listen church this condition is not only in the Pentecostal religions and other religion it a it is a condition of our age if you are not careful even as a believer of this message you can end up being lukewarm they religion why because they claim to serve God but when you look at the way they dress sincerely they are not serving God when you see what they are doing their life you can say no when you see what they believing you can say no these ones are they lukewarm even the preachers they preaching for money they they selling oil they selling water you know they what about the Believers of this message for me today I'm not attacking anyone I am attacking the Believers of the message because we are the ones who are believers he's saying you are lukewarm what brings this condition of lukewarmness where someone is a professed believer but their life speaks another thing that is a luk one believer where someone claims to believe but his life refuses he tells others I'm a Believer God bless you but his life is saying are you sure you a Believer and maybe you are here and you know you are God is saying you should not be be H or be cold be choose choose this day who you will serve will you continue to be lukew or you will be on fire for God what are you going to become let me tell you Church Satan can believe everything we believe did I hear you say Amen on that Satan can believe there is one God the Bible says you believe there is one you have done well even demons believe and they tremble Satan believes it and even trembles he believes in one God Satan doesn't is not aarian I want denominations who believe in the TR Satan has deceived them to believe in something he himself does not believe so he looks at them believing the Trinity and himself tells them you are dumb how can you believe three Gods me I believe there is one God but I deceived you to believe like that so you believe in one God Satan believes that too can believe all the collection of things we believe believes women should not wear trousers Satan doesn't believe in women preachers are you following me sat believes in Holiness sat believes in Holiness he believes everything the Bible says yes I am not crazy everything I'm saying is correct but there is one thing Satan has no ability to do Satan has no ability to live the life of what he believes [Music] Hallelujah but he believes it he even anoints preachers to preach his message of holiness preaching it everywhere but he doesn't have a life to back up his message are you hearing me Church the only difference between us and religion is the ability to have the life and we cannot oh listen to me tonight we cannot only preach you into that life you have to enter into that life by prayer without a prayer life you cannot have a personal Revival without a prayer life a church cannot have any Revival listen if we want to see Revival in our church let us rise up in pray let us wake up from sleep let us realize there is much more that God can do but is waiting for us to ask for and how do we ask we ask in prayer did you know you can believe in Holiness but you cannot live holy until you learn how toay yes I believe it many of us our life was changed in prayer we didn't even know how to pray but we just went there and powered our heart to God and you know God loves that when he sees a baby to him crying he always supplies every need and God doesn't give give Only Money although he gives it God doesn't give only gifts to the SP although he gives it God also gives a life in the Holy Ghost a chain you know you have no reason to struggle struggle by yourself let me tell you you can struggle as a Believer for years without changing you can come on the outter we shall pray for you you will not change and you will cry and struggle until many Believers listen clearly many message Believers have ended up saying there is no power to change me I have I've gone for prayer that prayed for me I've been under anointed preaching I've listen to the messages I believe everything but why am I not changing I will never change I think these things are not true it's always not for me now let me tell you the problem you are not ready to do the hard part the hard part is not done by for you by anyone this part is not the part that Jesus prayed for you you get a point yes he says he prayed for us many Believers have reached there he prayed for me I don't need to pray he prayed for you so you don't need to pray let me announce to you that's why you are living a defeated life but let me tell you if you want a life of victory in the Holy Ghost go in prayer how do you fight with stubborn Spirits Spirits which are troubling you which are squeezing your life out of you you do it through prayer and let me say this not prayer in a church service we have a Wednesday evening Sunday morning no I am talking about personal devotion whereby you say enough is enough I am not going to continue last like this no no no no no no no no I am going to go and talk about it with God and then you go to go in prayer God answers prayer brother Bram problem whereby he was confused about his life he was wondering some people were telling him he had a demon in him because he was hearing voices seeing visions and others were telling him of God others so he was confused which is which he read books he was preaching the gospel but still confused still confused he sat under preaching still confused you can sit under preaching and you will be confused you can hear people preaching and they will confuse you more but I'll tell you the solution brother Bram went to a cave and he started praying a place where there was no one a place where there where no one knew he didn't say hey hey I'm going for pray he went to be shut in with God he wanted to meet God so that God can explain to him things he did not understand God can explain to you things that have confused your life God can reveal to you things you confused about that is what our God can let me tell you some people have tapped the anointing of brother BR yet they are not in the message but for us where we are where the source is you can't you don't get what I'm talking about Joshua Salman josua a man in Nigeria a pcal preacher he said he was watching William Bram speaking about his life in the interview and that video is on our website you can go check it out and so he he was watching and he said he believed that that was God and when he believed the moment he belied he said he saw that P of fire about come through the screen and entered him it is the man's words and the next time when he went to a church service what did he see he noticed he had the ability to do dis than he I has ever had he said this publicly you can go check it out and there are many more who have given such testimonies but these people they're talking about something where we are we are at the source amen that angel that came and visited by the and he said this I've come to explain to you about your misunderstood life and he began telling him that go God is going to use you that if people will believe if you make the people believe you nothing will stand before you not even cancer now if the people will believe you which people I'm one of them Hallelujah if they will believe you nothing shall stop did you get it if they believe you nothing will stand before you brother Bram is not here but when he was there was a pill of fire with him in every service and I will tell you how it worked that pill of fire did not work on anyone who did not believe that P fire was moving and when would come over somebody then would see every deta about that person and then sometimes he would see the person not believing and then he would say oh she's about to she has missed it go but everybody who believe your name is so and so your problem is there your problem is there you are healed you are healed no problem stood before him no disease stood before him no demon stood before him no condition stood before him who was he not William Bram that angel of the Lord that P of and you know what that P of fire remain with the message and we are the message believer we are believing that message Hallelujah of the Angel of the Lord and that angel of the Lord is with the message of and anyone who believe that message of the hour with all their hearts nothing can stand before amen that means not demon no Spirit no addiction no sickness can remain there why because the pillar of fire is with the bright Hallelujah who is following the message so now why do we suffer and we don't get delivered and we Remain the condition because we don't want to do what did we don't want to pray Believers are the weakest prayer people do you have a relationship with God do you pray how long do you pray did you know you are supposed to pray every day did you know you are supposed to have a personal devotion with God we don't even need to call a prayer and fasting session you don't need to remember prayer when you come for overnight overnight should be one of the sessions that bring all our leaks of [Music] fire and then we come here and we begin to light up and burn every demon Spirit but you see if you were not praying in your own prayer altar you will come here and sleep you will still you will say you are tired you know some people are consoling themselves that they are tired when Jesus was here on Earth you know what Jesus was always praying are you saying to me that he was not tired let me tell you our body will be tired but our spirit can never be TI and that's why personal intercession is the way forward and and and I'll show you here in the Book of Ezekiel chapter 9 vers 4 and the Lord said unto him go through the midst of the city through the midst of Jerusalem and set a mark upon the foreheads of the men that sigh that cry for all the Abominations that be done in the mid now now did you see this Mark let me ask you what do you think is this Mark what is this Mark because I I only know two types of Mark the first one is what Cain received The Mark of Cain which actually we realize later on the same mark of the beast and we found that everyone who does not believe the truth receives that and everyone who Associates with nonbelievers their systems receives that now how do you receive the mark of God Jesus told them go in the upper room let me ask you a question why didn't he give to them that Holy Spirit without going to pray because he's a father a father doesn't give you anything unless you ask for it did you receive anything from your father without asking you ask no even when I was a baby I was asking yes by crying you cried for everything you wanted you cried everything so he gave it to you and he gave you more than you need so now our heavenly father also says this if the Earth parents cannot withhold any good thing from their children how much more our heavenly father if we ask for bread he cannot give us stores if we ask for fish he cannot give us something else he will give us exactly what we ask now Ezekiel has taken it on another level and he has said because remember I began in the Book of Revelation where I was speaking about ladia and the Bible says in ladia there they L they are wretched they poor they miserable they are blind they are naked but they don't know now they are confused is a bunch of confused people even in our churches confus people I was so surprised when I was at ucu and I was told later on I did not know that one of the of the sisters that came wearing a trouser was a believer of the message and that when I went there I was so anointed and I preached against and by the way I never do when there are people who are we I don't know what came over me that day I really roed them and this sister was there and I heard that she was very offended and she hasn't come back to those meetings let me tell you I'm using her I don't even know her exle but I wonder that's why Paul said oh Beed who Beed you that you start in the spirit you start in the spirit and now you are so muchal let me read it for you Galatians 3 it is so heartbreaking so heartbreaking you open Galatians chapter 3 I'm trying to find it here can you read it if you found [Music] it Galatians who has Bewitched you foolish Galatians who Beed you that you should not obey the truth before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth crucified among you this only would I learn of you received ye the speed by The Works of the law by the hearing of faith are you so foolish having begun in the spirit are he now made perfect by the flesh now friends I want us to understand something how can someone claim to be a believer being a sister and we and walk on the road a Christian the Bible in the book of deom 22 he called such a woman [Music] Anin and you find a sister I hope we don't have any who does that because if we do you need Deliverance the highest form of it but when we see those things around us what should it make us do a Believer called by the name believer living immorally shamess shamess because you see an immortal sin is a deliberate one you don't fall into it it was a mistake can you cannot fornicate by mistake it is impossible are you hearing it is impossible because how does it start you plan it especially it begins on the phone it begins on the phone all of you have phon how are you using your phone and I will tell you how you use that if you're not active on the church group and you're not active on the on the land F groups you never write any message any of your department groups then we know where you active because if if indeed you are not just active why do you have WhatsApp I'm sorry you know me I don't use WhatsApp delete them brother delete them sister because if you have it you are using it and if you're using it not with the Believers you are using it with the world you are compromised and you're compromising now what am I trying to say I am saying that you begin there getting into someone's [Music] inbox and then you send a message hello dear how are you and then you also know this brother is calling me dear you also as if you did not see the word yes my brother amen how are you and then to begins there it goes degrading degrading degrading degrading as you get used you want another and before you know it you your emotions are changing your mind is changing you have entitlements to them [Music] even how come you don't call me Brethren by the time you reach there and you need to repent you need a Revival and the ingredient of Revival is a prayer go in prayer for us when we were young and tempted by the things of the world the only way we need to overcome is going in prayer you just create a situation I will not eat I'm not do anything you're going in prayer you are in church you fight with all those little demons and then you come out feeling you a Victor they come again you go back they come again you go back they come again it is a battle if the devil Wes war on you you also declare declare a and the only way a Believer declares war is by going into fasting and pray you know Israel is a nation that fears no man even they said even if America does not stand with us we will go we will fight and they are fighting a war on seven fronts but they are fighting all of them and they a very small nation but the reason why they are fighting is not because they're very powerful but I'll tell you two reasons number one they fighting for their life they have a reason to fight their war is not like the American war on lib no there war is a war of survival and there second reason they fighting they know the word of God is on their side they know they have a promise president nany saide Minister he said recently when he was speaking in America I believe in the senator wherever it was he said that land was given to us by God am was on that line Our Father Isaac was on that so they know they have entitlement to that land because it was given to them by promise now our land of Holiness our land of righteousness has been given to us by a Divine decree when Jesus died he died for us soul body Spirit if the devil attacks you in your body don't go and begin crying like a baby go in prayer where your war against the enemy but believers they just accept and they surrender don't sing I surrender to Satan when you feel like you have fever and you know whenever you say I'm going to pray the devil brings a lot of reasons for you not to you know you're feeling fever some of you dragged the Holy Spirit dragged you I wanted to go today but I'm having fever maybe I should tell the pastor he will understand even the back is and you have not been sleeping prop the whole of this week I think really for sure why the devil knows that the only way this guy or this woman will defeat me is if he goes in prayer so demons always be watching you don't don't you know when they were asking uh when they were asking President Biden whether you know something about you know Iran and whatever he was just saying don't I believe demons are standing around us and each time you want to go to prayer don't don't don't let meay for don't don't don't and then you are in a spiritual you don't know even here you have come here but demons will try to that's when you will feel very heavy if you're watching a documentary or something can watch for hours when will you sleep I will sleep but when you begin praying I know how the other ones make it the problem I'm tired you are not tired brother those are demons they're trying to stop you they're fighting with you that's they come to you and they give you all sorts of excuses brother don't accept the only W that you should declare that is just is a war for your survival if you do not fight you will not win but if you fight you will win sometimes you are passing through things that you can't understand may not be in the flesh may be in the spirit even you are making money and money is refusing to come let me tell you go in prayer pray pray I was hearing some of these old pastors one of them was giving a testimony that even when they wanted visas and JS and things like that they they were getting it in prayer thatth when they go to get a job and this man refuses the you have the job they will boldly speak to them you are fired and then he goes in prayer and he fires that man or that and afterwards he goes and gets the job don't joke with prayer Brothers don't joke with prayer let me read for you something here don't joke with prayer prayer is is the only thing a Believer has now listen is okay I'm reading from the paman church age I didn't plan to read this but just the Holy Spirit brought it to me praise the name of the Lord historians acknowledge that now this is about mtin historians acknowledge that uh on at least three occasions he on at least three occasions he raised the Dead by faith in Jesus name in one instance he prayed for a dead Bo baby like elishah he stretched himself upon the baby and prayed he came back to life and health on another occasion he was called to help deliver a brother who was being away to his death in a time of great persecution by the time he arrived the poor man was already dead they had hanged him upon a tree his body was lifeless and his eyes protruded from the sockets but Martin took him down and when he had PR the man was restored to life and to his rejoicing family do we serve the same God but we don't see the things because we don't pray enough hallu Mar never did fear the enemy regardless of who it was thus he went to personally f a wicked Emperor who was responsible for the death of many spirit filled sin the emperor would not Grant an audience sotin went to see a friend of the emperor so he went one to a man called Damascus cruel Bishop of Rome and the bishop being a nominal Christian of the false Vine he refused to intercede for Martin Martin went back to the Palace now imagine those moments when no the answer is no you want things and listen Martin went back to the Palace but by the by now the gates had been [Music] locked and they would not allow him to enter he laid down on his face before the Lord the gates closed they W allow him to enter what do you do he laid down before the Lord and prayed that he be able to get into that place oh I want that kind of Reckless face may God give us that to believe for the impossible to believe God is more than enough prayer can do anything prayer is not a joke God is in prayer he had a voice beating him arise he was not dreaming he was not dreaming this was real when he did so he saw the gates open by theirselves he didn't ask who opened it he knew he had so he walked into the court but the Arrogant ruler would not turn his head to speak to Martin Martin was there this one did not even turn his head he had closed Martin outside and God brought Martin inside let me tell you it doesn't matter where your blessing has been closed where your deliverance has been closed from go in prayer God will lift You by Supernatural power from one place to the place where you should be let me tell you some of us we walk by faith not by S let me tell you we must be red Christians it doesn't matter how many impossibilities are before you if you are claiming your god-given promise God promis Revival the ingredient of Revival is a prayer you may be feeling weak but prayer is the ingredient so the Arrogant ruler wouldn't even look at him Martin again pray hallelujah hallelujah M again PR suddenly a fire came spontaneously from the seat of the throne and the uny emperor where did the fire come from our God is the consing fire hallelujah amen as we are going to prayer tonight brother your prayer brings down fire hallelujah amen begin burning up all those little spirits and demons of Defeat of prayerlessness of an immortal life of sin you know of of bad appetites yes of addictions prayer will burn those little demons of joblessness yes even joblessness is a demon because the devil doesn't want it to work even the job you want you only get it by prayer not by planning planning is good but it should come after prayer the emperor the emperor you know evated speedly speedly heated the throne speedly oh my God surely the Lord humbl the proud and exalts the lonly brother if you humble yourself before God In Prayer you know what it's going to do he going to lift you some of you feel like you feel as if things failed for you your problem is you're hypocrite that is the only problem you have you're not sincere in the heart many Believers are not sincere they are hypocrites they are not coming to God with all their heart they are covering some parts and opening some parts rather open everything to him let him work on you as a doctor would work on a patient pray Church home tell God the way you see me news I am my life is come and do something I'm not going to remain in this I want to see a miracle God Who Makes Miracles is the god who gives children and the one who gives children is the one who gives is the one who sends demon are you he what I'm saying he gives money you're doing a business that is not moving pray for the business and when you pray and don't work keep pray they refuse F you must be persistent don't allow the overcome in this [Applause] how shall we get the church land if we don't have UNS and we pray for the same we have to come as a group as a church agree on some of those things put together praise the name of the Lord I'm going to read a several quotes here before I finish in a message of paradox uh you know we take con we are living in a day of hybrid everything is hybrid even hybrid the church they Vib the church from the word to intellectual Creed domination Jesus never did say go make denominations he never did say uh go build schools he said preach the gospel demonstrate everybody said demonstrate demonstrate the power of the Word of Promise Hallelujah you demonstrate the power of the word in every situation there is no there is nothing which will refuse to move sickness will move joblessness will move immorality will move by the way demons move that prostitute came to Jesus she walked CH what happened there was a power [Music] now we got he says you Pentecostal women your mothers used to stand on the corner no stockings on little old wore out shoes them tennis beating and tambourine the denominations laughed at her and made fun of her dad stood there with needing a haircut picking up corn on the road somewhere to feed your kids it is too bad you got away from it now you got a bunch of Ricky in there that wants to come like the rest of them like Israel did they wanted a king of their own you want to make your own and now what you got a bunch of educated [Music] Rick that's what we have in the churches they got this intellectual they want to be like the rest of them do so and so do so and so and where has it has it got you to you are more prettier they are better churches but where is that Spirit was that was in there where is them all night prayer meetings them sin of the city remember the holy spirit said in the last days go seal those only who cry and S for the Abominations did in the city that's the same thing God wants to do today he's going to seal you he's going to feel you if you cry and sigh for the sins we see around us I want you ministers to lay your hands upon that member of your church you Pentecostal ministers then when you find this then you come and and I will apologize to you you find that member of yours that can't rest day and night for crying for the abomination of sins done in the city see if it won't happen one member brother B ising the pcal one member of your church who cries and Si day and night pray for the abomination of sins done in the city of sins done in our Message Church some people who would go you don't need to collect everybody to do that do it as a person pray maybe no one will ever know you do it go pray pray every day pray pray for the churches pray for the young people pray for the mothers pray for the father there are many things to pray about pray for the ministry pray for the young men who are rising in the ministry pray for the deacons pray for the pastors pray but 90% of them they stay at home and they want to to watch who loves suie oh you speak with tongues she jump up and down and Shout that's all right nothing against that nothing against that organization even but I'm trying to talk about life where is it at and I hope that none of us here as Believers ever puts those television programs it is filth shouldn't be the one to rule and Lead our home we have better things let me tell you we need to wake up because I believe the Rapture is very soon we don't have any time to waste let's get so out to the work of God let me tell you when the Rapture comes on you who has been on the border line you will cry you will sigh but you will all be for nothing cry and sigh now amen man and woman who live in there as a misunderstood they become peculiar they don't hear the things of the world if they do they don't pay attention to them they just move on God never put that in there for nothing God never come for just any halfhazard way [Music] prayer is not a perhaps prayer is not let me let me try and see we have not come to try and when you go to PR believe amen prayer is a sincere thing prayer is talking to God prayer is not getting done is is not get down shut your eyes and thinking about your washing or your work you are doing and then you say Lord help me andn and peace and and heal miss joh and remember also the other sister and also Lord I commit the other that is not prayer that is repeating some words but prayer is to come into an atmosphere where you realize that you are in the presence of God and you're moving to then in the deepest of of sincerity first is a worship oh Jehovah how I love you you see it then after the worship then you come with a sincere heart asking praise the name of the Lord hallelujah Hallelujah that's how to pray that is how to approach prayer father the hour has come that message then you got to read in the Bible and you find out that none of the things that Jesus said was going on in the church this shall follow them it doesn't follow Jesus said they shall follow them that believe not they may be will perhaps they will they will for a certain amount of time no he said these signs shall follow them that believe brother let me tell you if you don't know what to pray for let me tell you what to pray for if miracles signs and wonders are not following your life then go in prayer my brother something is not right and don't settle for what you have I need a miracle Lord I need a miracle in my home in my children in the church in the work of God I need a miracle I need to see them following me if they are not there then I need to check my experience with God and it was promised to the end of the world I want the page and the scripture where he said he took it away from them then he would contradict his own way see what a mess you would get into this sign shall follow them that was a marking a Memorial a mark of True [Applause] Believers that he was in the mid Hallelujah I will mark them them who cry and S for the Abominations that are done in the city how will he make you with signs Fall Away because he showing himself and manifesting himself by these signs now to think a church built being built on that let the world creep in why certainly it will Rouse the indignation of a real true servant of God it is [Music] wrong let's get the thing out of there get away from this old lukewarm halfway say a little prayer over morning amen prayer at night and go to bed and get up the next morning no wonder we are getting wildly no wonder we are getting do you believe this no wonder we are getting worldly no wonder the world is Creed into the church because we don't stay in prayer there is no more agonizing there is no more staying before God stay not just 1 2 3 4 20 minutes no stay before God agonizing praying from the heart there is no more digging out cleaning up we need a old fashion Revival we just pull ourself we are in the assemblies we in the Pentecostal we are the Oneness we are we are this we are that we don't have nothing with that other group no that is where the Holy Spirit leaves you and someone may say that is from 1956 but let me read you something from 1963 oh Lord just once more they remember of seeing that Jo born in his hand and saying who else wants some of this he was a man who could speak he was man who was anointed of God God promised to bless him he was in the strength of Jehovah oh no doubt there is many here can remember back when the church stood in that kind of strength but now all broke up all kind of denominations one fighting the other the old all night prayer Mee meetings is not hard of no more Street meetings is absolutely gone they are obsolete yet we've got our structure we got the framework but where is the god of the Miracles frankly many denied they even deny Divine Healing let me tell you many of our M churches have nice buildings now but I have one question where is that God of the Miracles where is that God that will fire up younger men not old men young men and they will go on the streets and begin preaching younger ladies and they will be constantly in prayer you see how old these Revival start it was out of prayer God used a man called William Sim uh you know spoke of Thea Revival but you see these men were men of prayer men of prayer men and women of prayer we need a Revival we need a Revival in our lives you see if we prayed like some of the denominations pray we would have been very far because the bride Revival is not only the Revival of the word but it is also the Revival of the power let us stand on our feet we warm up and go to prayer this is the time where you feel tired where the Devil comes to begin smiting the musici can come but let me tell you you need to press on you need to fight it fight it out do not allow yourself to be withdrawn from the things of the spirit this is your moment for your personal Revival there's an old song that says Lord send your power just I wonder if the brother if the musicians can come please where are they brother Dixon please do you have it brother Marvin hallelujah praise the Lord come so we're just going to have about um at least two hours of prayer just individual prayers and uh pray here if you come go in a corner where you want to go and then after that we'll come and you know
