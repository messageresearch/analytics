[0:00] You might not be seeing the miracles
[0:01] like you saw back there,
[0:03] &gt;&gt; but he's still taking you into the
[0:05] promised land.
[0:08] &gt;&gt; God is able.
[0:10] &gt;&gt; No matter the issue,
[0:13] &gt;&gt; no matter the DNA,
[0:15] &gt;&gt; no matter the genealogy, whatever that
[0:17] word is,
[0:22] &gt;&gt; God is able.
[0:25] And the scripture says,
[0:28] &gt;&gt; the scripture says, "Now these things
[0:31] were for our examples
[0:34] to the intent that we should not lust
[0:36] after evil things as they also lusted."
[0:41] And can I say it's a lot easier to learn
[0:44] from somebody else's mistake
[0:48] than to make it yourself than to make it
[0:50] yourself.
[0:54] Though some of us are a little more
[0:55] stubborn than others
[0:58] and we need to make the mistake before
[1:00] we learn,
[1:04] I personally
[1:06] would prefer to look at a life that's
[1:08] just gone off the rails
[1:12] and say I don't need to go off the rails
[1:14] to see what my life can be like.
[1:17] I can just live a good Christian life.
[1:22] And if you're sitting here, if you're
[1:24] sitting here this evening,
[1:26] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham gets through preaching
[1:27] the seven seals and he's trying to get a
[1:29] message across and the fishing lines
[1:31] become entangled
[1:33] and he's getting almost frustrated and
[1:36] he says, "Don't don't worry about it
[1:38] all. Just live a clean Christian life."
[1:41] He says, "And the rest will take care of
[1:44] itself."
[1:46] Sometimes we try to understand every
[1:48] revelation.
[1:50] We think we don't have the Holy Ghost. I
[1:53] don't understand every revelation.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; You don't need to understand every
[2:00] revelation.
[2:02] &gt;&gt; You just need to believe in your
[2:04] position.
[2:06] And God in his time will unveil the
[2:10] mysteries to you.
[2:12] So many times we strive and we struggle.
[2:15] We sweat. We cry
[2:18] and we pray and we fast and we read the
[2:20] message book over and over
[2:25] and you say, "Lord, I give up."
[2:27] &gt;&gt; And then you're driving your car not
[2:29] thinking about anything and suddenly you
[2:32] got it.
[2:34] You got it. That revelation drops into
[2:36] your heart.
[2:39] Just live a clean Christian life.
[2:42] It'll all be okay.
[2:49] Brother Brandham would say,
[2:51] &gt;&gt; he says, "You can't add and take away
[2:53] from the perfect revelation of God and
[2:55] overcome the enemy."
[3:03] He says, "Nothing gives prevailing power
[3:05] over the enemy as revelation of the
[3:09] word."
[3:11] It's not the emotion,
[3:14] &gt;&gt; it's the revelation.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; And if the revelation brings emotion,
[3:20] hallelujah anyway,
[3:22] but don't rely on the emotion for the
[3:25] revelation.
[3:28] It's not about how you're feeling.
[3:31] It's about what the word says.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; So don't ask me how I am.
[3:37] Ask me what the word says about me.
[3:41] Because sometimes I'm lost.
[3:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I'm saved.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Sometimes I unbride myself.
[3:49] &gt;&gt; But there's something in the scripture
[3:52] &gt;&gt; that says I can never be lost.
[3:58] &gt;&gt; So I choose to believe what the word
[4:00] says about me
[4:02] rather than what I know about me.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Cuz the word is right. I don't want to
[4:10] talk to no serpent.
[4:12] &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I'm naked.
[4:15] &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I'm a sinner.
[4:17] &gt;&gt; I don't want to learn that I've gone the
[4:19] wrong way.
[4:21] &gt;&gt; But let me believe what the word says.
[4:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:28] &gt;&gt; So here
[4:30] &gt;&gt; the old fighters, the problem with the
[4:32] old fighters is they had a memory of
[4:33] Egypt.
[4:35] &gt;&gt; They had such a memory. And I need to
[4:37] close. I know. But let me say this. The
[4:39] old fighters had a memory of Egypt.
[4:43] The old The old fighters, they enjoyed
[4:45] being told what to do.
[4:49] They preferred the system of Egypt.
[4:53] They preferred They preferred go and
[4:55] make a city, go and make a brick, go and
[4:57] get some straw.
[5:03] for the garlic and onions of Egypt.
[5:09] &gt;&gt; Who likes onion and garlic?
[5:12] &gt;&gt; Give me a nice steak dinner. Give me
[5:14] some potatoes. Give me some fries. Give
[5:17] me pizza.
[5:19] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to onions and
[5:21] garlic. Give me something nice.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; Give me something that will sustain me
[5:27] through time.
[5:29] Oh, for the church I grew up in. And so
[5:31] many so many people say, "Oh, I wish I
[5:34] was back in the church I grew up in."
[5:37] What are they doing? They're looking
[5:38] back at the woods. They're looking
[5:40] backwards.
[5:42] Look forwards where God has placed you.
[5:47] Stop saying to your pastor, "We must do
[5:49] it like the way I grew up."
[5:53] Stand where God has placed you.
[5:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:59] So the problem was
[6:02] when God introduced the law to the old
[6:04] fighters
[6:06] they should have said no Lord
[6:09] give us grace.
[6:11] &gt;&gt; But brother Brandon would say he says
[6:14] they wanted something they could do.
[6:17] You can read it in the scripture. He
[6:18] says the the greatest mistake they ever
[6:21] made was wanting something to do
[6:26] because they had a slave mentality,
[6:30] a slave mentality. And slaves do not
[6:33] possess land.
[6:36] Slaves just work the land.
[6:39] And if you go through life with a slave
[6:42] mentality,
[6:43] oh, I'm just a sinner. Oh, I'm just
[6:46] lost.
[6:47] God is saying with that slave mentality,
[6:52] you can never take the land.
[6:55] God appoints a children.
[6:58] &gt;&gt; They can take over the Jordan River to
[7:01] possess the land.
[7:03] But they could never possess the land
[7:06] because they had a slave mentality.
[7:10] Slaves take commands.
[7:14] They want something to do.
[7:17] They should have said, "I don't want the
[7:20] law.
[7:22] Give me the token that we had in Egypt.
[7:26] Give me the blood.
[7:28] Give me grace.
[7:31] I don't want something that I've got to
[7:33] do.
[7:34] I just want to believe on a finished
[7:36] work at Calvary."
[7:40] &gt;&gt; No wonder they feared the giants in
[7:43] Canaan.
[7:45] giant brother say fear
[7:49] lack of faith.
[7:51] They didn't believe who they were.
[7:55] They didn't believe because slaves work
[7:57] for a master.
[8:00] They work for the taskmaster of Egypt
[8:05] for the law.
[8:08] Never shake that slave mentality.
[8:14] in the wilderness
[8:17] and put their whole eternal destination
[8:22] experience.
[8:25] The land is over the river.
[8:28] Don't rely on an experience in the
[8:31] wilderness.
[8:34] I just received a sensation and it could
[8:36] never change the desires of man.
[8:44] in slavery
[8:47] free,
[8:49] spiritually still in bondage,
[8:53] pulled out of a denomination,
[8:56] still in bondage to a system.
[9:00] He's saying redemption is coming out and
[9:03] going in.
[9:07] You are not redeemed. You are not
[9:09] redeemed by coming out.
[9:11] You're redeemed when you go in.
[9:14] Don't rely on a wilderness experience.
[9:18] Cross the Red Sea and ate the mana. He
[9:22] saw the cloud
[9:24] and God says not taking the land
[9:29] because of a mentality problem, a slave
[9:32] problem.
[9:34] And he goes the Israelites through the
[9:36] wilderness with a reproach of Egypt upon
[9:39] them.
[9:41] Brother would say, "Many of you through
[9:44] the city, through the country,
[9:47] nothing but church slaves
[9:51] are slaves to Christianity
[9:54] that you should be free.
[9:57] I'm thankful for the message.
[10:00] I'm thankful for predestination
[10:03] that has come to call me out of church
[10:06] slavery.
[10:08] I don't want to be a slave to a system.
[10:13] I don't want that Christianity that when
[10:15] my life is falling apart
[10:18] that I have to run to the pastor,
[10:22] pastor, pastor, what do I do?
[10:26] I want enough of God in me
[10:30] that when sickness strikes the home,
[10:33] I don't have to ring brother Buzz and
[10:35] say, "Pray for me.
[10:37] I can pray. I can say I know my heavenly
[10:41] father is hearing my prayer.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; I have a relationship with Jesus Christ.
[10:48] &gt;&gt; I'm not relying on my pastor for a
[10:50] relationship.
[10:52] It's me and Christ.
[10:59] God has taken individuals in a rapture.
[11:04] I'm thankful for a message that has come
[11:07] to lead me out of the system.
[11:11] I'm thankful for a message that is
[11:13] changing my mentality.
[11:18] When there's no sensation in the new
[11:20] land,
[11:22] I'm okay.
[11:25] I know who I am. I know where I come
[11:28] from. that when I pray and it's like a
[11:32] black sheet comes down,
[11:35] I know who I am.
[11:38] That's what I desire.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; We must recognize our day and its
[11:43] message.
[11:45] &gt;&gt; You might feel a sensation.
[11:48] Stake your eternal destination on that.
[11:54] Brother would say, "One of the mysteries
[11:56] of the age
[12:00] is receiving the Holy Ghost without
[12:02] sensation.
[12:04] You never heard that in the message.
[12:08] That is the mystery of the age.
[12:11] &gt;&gt; This is what Sister Bruce was saying. I
[12:14] have no emotion though.
[12:16] Brother saying, "But you've got the Holy
[12:18] Ghost.
[12:21] I don't have the Holy Ghost."
[12:23] He's saying, "You've got it. I've
[12:25] searched your life.
[12:28] Prophet saw a vision of you over there.
[12:33] Faith in the vision,
[12:36] faith in the word of God.
[12:39] You may never feel a thing
[12:42] and then make a mistake.
[12:44] Don't unbride yourself.
[12:49] That's not even a word, but we're making
[12:51] it a word. Unbride.
[12:57] Don't unbride yourself.
[13:00] Don't write yourself off.
[13:04] You can have the Holy Ghost and still
[13:05] make a mistake.
[13:08] But there must be a conviction
[13:11] that shows what you've got.
[13:14] And brother Brandon would say, "Full
[13:17] obedience to the whole word of God
[13:22] entitles you to the token.
[13:25] So, so what is full obedience?
[13:31] Repent and be baptized in the name of
[13:33] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[13:36] He says it will entitle you to the
[13:37] token.
[13:41] And he says God wants to give it to you
[13:43] more than you want to receive.
[13:48] So, if you're sitting here and praying
[13:50] and praying for the Holy Ghost,
[13:54] maybe you've got it and you don't even
[13:55] know.
[13:57] Can I say there's no point in my life?
[14:03] &gt;&gt; I'm a message child.
[14:05] There's no point in my life I can put my
[14:07] finger on
[14:09] and say that time I got the Holy Ghost.
[14:15] But I know I met him.
[14:18] I know I met him. Why? Because the
[14:21] desires of my heart have been changing
[14:24] &gt;&gt; from glory to glory.
[14:31] Have you ever heard a preacher say that
[14:33] to you?
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard a preacher say, "I
[14:37] don't know the moment I got the Holy
[14:39] Ghost."
[14:44] But I know I got it.
[14:46] I'll tell you more tomorrow, but I know
[14:49] I got it.
[14:51] How do I know I got it?
[14:54] My life has changed.
[15:00] Amen. I hope that helps somebody.
[15:04] &gt;&gt; D my pride a little bit to say it.
[15:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Holy Spirit will lead you
[15:14] into all truth.
[15:17] Amen. Brother Brandon would say, "It's a
[15:19] mystery.
[15:22] The person of Christ performing in you
[15:24] the same works he did."
[15:30] &gt;&gt; He gave Canaan to the Israelites, the
[15:32] Holy Ghost to us.
[15:38] Let me go a little bit deeper, then I'm
[15:39] going to close.
[15:42] There's a real push in the message to go
[15:43] back to Pentecost.
[15:49] I don't want to go back to Pentecost.
[15:52] I want to go back to Eden.
[15:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Why would I want to go backwards
[15:59] when God has eaten from me?
[16:04] &gt;&gt; So, Brother Brandon would say,
[16:06] &gt;&gt; he says, "But you see, each one of those
[16:08] ages only took taken a dip
[16:12] into the Holy Spirit.
[16:17] Sanctification is a work of the Holy
[16:19] Spirit.
[16:22] Sanctification is a work of the Holy
[16:24] Spirit.
[16:27] He says, "But the baptism is the Holy
[16:29] Spirit."
[16:32] That's the reason
[16:34] for a prophetic prophet to come down.
[16:39] Oh messenger to this age
[16:43] but the Holy Ghost came himself
[16:50] in his fullness of the baptism.
[16:54] What is he saying? He's saying come out
[16:56] of Lady Aia
[16:59] calling you into the bride age.
[17:02] I'm not talking about another eighth
[17:04] age. I'm talking about an age in an age.
[17:10] Okay, I put it like this. My flesh is in
[17:13] Ladyia.
[17:16] There's sin all around my flesh,
[17:19] but my spirit,
[17:21] my soul
[17:23] has been called upwards.
[17:26] Come up hither.
[17:28] Come up high.
[17:30] &gt;&gt; I don't want to go back to Lady A.
[17:33] I don't want to go back to Pentecost.
[17:36] I have a desire in my heart to be God
[17:39] tangible.
[17:42] The world is looking to destroy itself.
[17:46] Let them see life.
[17:48] Let them see Christ.
[17:53] Amen. Amen.
[17:55] &gt;&gt; He says they're taking a dip. It's a
[17:57] dip.
[18:01] &gt;&gt; Where's a bottle of water? If I hold
[18:03] this, we say water in Australia. water.
[18:06] &gt;&gt; Water.
[18:07] &gt;&gt; So, if I have this bottle of water,
[18:10] &gt;&gt; if I put my finger down into this bottle
[18:13] and dip my finger in this bottle of
[18:15] water, I pull it back out after a little
[18:19] while,
[18:20] my finger dries off again.
[18:24] I don't want no dip of Holy Ghost.
[18:28] Back there, back there, they had a dip.
[18:32] It says now the fullness of Christ
[18:34] himself
[18:37] to a group of people
[18:41] back there.
[18:43] &gt;&gt; I want him in the inside
[18:46] to the outside.
[18:52] I don't have no come and go anointing
[18:57] him
[19:00] performing the same works that Jesus
[19:02] Christ did.
[19:05] Is that the message of the hour?
[19:08] A dip is a work of the Holy Spirit. A
[19:11] dip is a genuine work of God.
[19:17] It says the person of the Holy Ghost has
[19:20] descended. Another
[19:23] spot he says the gift is the gift but
[19:25] the giver himself has come.
[19:31] &gt;&gt; Why why would I want the gift when I can
[19:34] have the giver?
[19:36] Why would I settle for an emotion when I
[19:38] can have a revelation?
[19:42] Why would I settle for a Pentecostal
[19:44] experience when I can have that and go
[19:47] on?
[19:51] Amen.
[19:54] &gt;&gt; Never settle for a Pentecostal
[19:56] experience. That's important to the
[19:57] believer. Yes.
[20:01] &gt;&gt; On with the experience.
[20:04] &gt;&gt; Go on with the cloud.
[20:07] &gt;&gt; Never concrete
[20:09] down.
[20:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Well done.
[20:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:16] &gt;&gt; I only speak English.
[20:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. It's all right. So, brother
[20:19] Random would say
[20:22] birth pains in the birth pains message
[20:25] he says delivered of a new birth
[20:29] &gt;&gt; according to Malachi 4
[20:33] again under Malachi 4
[20:37] again. And what's it doing? It's calling
[20:39] you into Jordan.
[20:42] Come to possess your inheritance.
[20:47] And Joshua is watching the old fighters
[20:49] dying out.
[20:53] Those who failed to go on with the
[20:56] prophet's message.
[20:59] But there's a generation rising up
[21:02] saying it doesn't matter what they say
[21:06] going over.
[21:09] No matter the hindrance,
[21:12] no matter the serpent's message, no
[21:14] matter the unbelief that
[21:17] hits me sometimes
[21:20] crossing over.
[21:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me make this the last
[21:24] scripture. Let me make this the last
[21:25] scripture. Joshua chapter 5.
[21:28] &gt;&gt; Joshua 5 verse 2.
[21:31] &gt;&gt; Why don't we turn to it? Let's turn to
[21:32] it. Let's turn Joshua chapter 5. Joshua.
[21:36] &gt;&gt; We'll leave a little while for brother
[21:37] Michael.
[21:42] Joshua 5 verse 2.
[21:46] &gt;&gt; We've got that there. Okay. It says,
[21:49] "And at that time they're preparing.
[21:51] They're preparing to cross.
[21:54] &gt;&gt; Or can I say they've crossed, they're in
[21:55] the new land, crossed through the
[21:57] Jordan.
[22:00] They've had an experience in the
[22:01] Jordan."
[22:04] And it says Joshua 5:2 it says, "And at
[22:07] that time,
[22:10] &gt;&gt; the Lord said unto Joshua,
[22:13] &gt;&gt; make thee sharp knives,
[22:16] circumcise again
[22:19] the children of Israel
[22:21] the second time. A new birth can be a
[22:24] painful thing
[22:28] to ourselves."
[22:30] Paul would write in Romans, he says, "I
[22:32] beseech thee by the mercies of the
[22:34] living God
[22:37] your body as a living sacrifice."
[22:44] &gt;&gt; The thing about a living sacrifice is
[22:47] the fire gets a little hot. I'm getting
[22:50] off the sacrifice. I'm getting off the
[22:52] altar.
[22:54] &gt;&gt; But he says, "I beseech you.
[22:57] lay your life down as a living
[23:00] sacrifice.
[23:03] And Joshua made him sharp knives
[23:06] and circumcised the children of Israel
[23:08] at the hill of the foreskins.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; These were children that were born in
[23:14] Egypt, born in the wilderness.
[23:18] What can I say? Those born in Egypt were
[23:20] circumcised,
[23:23] which we know it's a type of the Holy
[23:25] Ghost. But those born in the wilderness
[23:29] were not circumcised.
[23:31] They were going to enter into the
[23:33] promised land circumcised.
[23:36] The issue here was the parents were not
[23:39] keeping the word in the wilderness.
[23:42] The parents were adapting the quotes to
[23:44] fit their mentality.
[23:49] in it
[23:52] became stagnant with the word
[23:56] able to move with the revelation.
[23:59] Parents wanted to keep their children in
[24:01] the wilderness.
[24:03] Our children will be pray if we go in.
[24:09] So many times us parents I'm a parent of
[24:11] three children.
[24:14] We use the message sometimes as a uh as
[24:17] a stick.
[24:19] We just beat our children into
[24:21] submission.
[24:23] &gt;&gt; We do. We use the message as our weapon
[24:25] to control things around us.
[24:31] The message is not your weapon.
[24:34] The message is Jesus Christ.
[24:37] Coming to lead you into the promised
[24:39] land.
[24:41] Never use the message as a list of rules
[24:44] of dos and don'ts.
[24:49] You may be have been born. You may have
[24:51] been born in the message.
[24:53] You still need to receive the Holy
[24:55] Ghost.
[24:58] You still need to be born again.
[25:02] Verse 9, Joshua 5:9.
[25:05] It says, "And the Lord said unto Joshua,
[25:08] &gt;&gt; this day,
[25:10] and I rolled away
[25:13] of Egypt from off of you,
[25:18] They left Egypt 40 plus years earlier.
[25:23] They walked through the wilderness
[25:26] with a reproach of slavery upon them
[25:30] through the wilderness, worrying about
[25:32] the problems in the past,
[25:35] arguing in the family,
[25:38] the divorce problems in the family,
[25:41] the sickness in the family.
[25:43] No matter what your slavery is here,
[25:46] there's something that holds us
[25:48] sometimes.
[25:50] We walk through life with a heavy
[25:51] burden.
[25:53] God is saying this day have I rolled
[25:57] away.
[26:00] So no matter what you're going through,
[26:03] the problems of your past
[26:08] with you, leave them behind.
[26:13] rolled away. The reproach of Egypt
[26:18] times the reproach is so large
[26:23] carried away
[26:26] rolled away
[26:29] carrying
[26:32] lay it at the foot of the cross
[26:37] time.
[26:39] From this time,
[26:41] there might be something in your life,
[26:44] let faith come and take control.
[26:49] The message of the hour,
[26:52] the preaching of the word that you hear,
[26:56] drive away that Satan that's sitting on
[26:59] your shoulder.
[27:07] You know what Jesus said on the cross?
[27:10] &gt;&gt; It is finished.
[27:16] &gt;&gt; No matter what you're carrying,
[27:19] it's finished.
[27:21] &gt;&gt; The children, the children have got a
[27:23] faith to believe the word for
[27:26] the children.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; As parents, never stand in the way of
[27:32] the children.
[27:35] Brother Brandon said, "Never let me
[27:36] stand in your way. If you've got faith,
[27:43] so just because they don't believe it.
[27:46] I believe it.
[27:49] I am not ashamed of the message,
[27:52] the nonsense in the wilderness."
[27:55] Nonsense. You say that here? Nonsense.
[27:58] the arguing the church splits.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Whatever it is down the line,
[28:05] it is not your fault.
[28:08] &gt;&gt; I will not keep you out of the promised
[28:09] land.
[28:12] It is the promised land.
[28:15] This this day have I rolled away.
[28:19] Let me take the land.
[28:22] The kingdom of God is within you.
[28:26] Let me take the land.
[28:28] &gt;&gt; Let me take the flesh,
[28:30] the word that is in the inside.
[28:34] And then just because you've got the
[28:36] Holy Ghost,
[28:38] &gt;&gt; doesn't mean all your personal problems
[28:40] are going to just fly away.
[28:46] I wish it did.
[28:51] I thought growing up in the message
[28:54] that if I just got the Holy Ghost,
[28:58] all would be okay.
[29:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, it will be all okay,
[29:04] &gt;&gt; but there's going to be problems
[29:07] as it is okay.
[29:14] Amen. Do you know what the scripture
[29:16] says?
[29:18] Jesus being full of the Holy Ghost, led
[29:21] by the spirit into the wilderness to be
[29:24] tempted.
[29:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus tempted but never fell.
[29:32] &gt;&gt; We might fall sometimes.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; Get back up again.
[29:38] Amen. Stand to our feet.
[29:48] Let me say
[29:50] &gt;&gt; I can't delete the memories of the past.
[29:53] I can't delete the memories of the past.
[29:58] But don't let the memories
[30:01] and the images
[30:03] and the pictures that you looked at
[30:06] that you should not have looked at.
[30:09] Don't let that control your destiny.
[30:14] You may never get what you did out of
[30:16] your mind,
[30:21] but the scripture says
[30:24] it's not in the mind of God,
[30:29] &gt;&gt; take faith,
[30:31] take faith.
[30:33] To he who overcomes
[30:35] will I give all things.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Take faith. Let us take the land.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Let me read this quote. He says, "If the
[30:43] slaves want to stay in the walled city,
[30:46] let them stay.
[30:49] For you are free.
[30:52] You are free. You are free." He says,
[30:55] "Let's go back to our inheritance.
[31:00] Let us go back to Eden.
[31:03] I don't want to go back to Pentecost.
[31:05] Let me go in rapture. Let me be restored
[31:09] back to Eden.
[31:12] I was just telling our brother Tasha,
[31:14] I'm going to close. last thing.
[31:17] It says when you see where he's talking
[31:19] about eagle written in the rock.
[31:24] My pastor was preaching back home
[31:27] &gt;&gt; and he was saying if you get brother
[31:29] Brandham's handwriting, his style of
[31:31] handwriting,
[31:34] you take the page of notes and you put
[31:36] it next to the handwriting.
[31:40] The exact same handwriting.
[31:44] Exact same handwriting.
[31:46] but yet written by God.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; And when you look at the handwriting,
[31:52] it's a little bit messy.
[31:55] &gt;&gt; My handwriting is shocking.
[31:59] &gt;&gt; But you look at the handwriting, it's a
[32:00] little messy.
[32:03] When Moses come down off the mountain
[32:07] carrying the Ten Commandments
[32:09] written by the finger of God,
[32:12] &gt;&gt; I wonder if it looked like Moses
[32:14] handwriting.
[32:16] I wonder if it looked a little bit
[32:18] messy.
[32:20] &gt;&gt; Your life is written by God.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Though your life is messy sometimes.
[32:28] Though your life looks a little untidy
[32:30] sometimes.
[32:32] Your life is written by God. You are an
[32:35] epistle already written of God.
[32:39] And the scripture says, "You are my
[32:42] bride.
[32:44] I see a church,
[32:46] &gt;&gt; a glorious church,
[32:48] &gt;&gt; without spot without wrinkle.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; God, when God created Adam and Eve,
[32:57] &gt;&gt; he said it is very good.
[33:02] When he created created you,
[33:05] when he created his bride,
[33:07] he said, "It is a glorious church
[33:11] without spot
[33:13] wrinkle." Who are you this evening?
[33:17] You must recognize your worth.
[33:20] Recognize the worth of what is behind
[33:22] this.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:31] God bless you. Come along.
[33:43] Father Enoch, you want to come up?
[33:54] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us give the Lord a clap of
[33:57] praise for the word coming.
[34:02] You know,
[34:06] um, we sure know that the Holy Ghost is
[34:09] not emotion.
[34:13] How many can say 100% amen on that?
[34:17] The Holy Spirit is not emotional.
[34:20] But the Holy Spirit is emotional.
[34:27] Can we say amen to that?
[34:32] &gt;&gt; Oh man, I think you have to wait for
[34:33] tomorrow.
[34:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say what I said?
[34:45] Amen. Is that amen? Now that's why the
[34:48] prophet said anything without emotion is
[34:55] And you know, brother Josh said, "Satan
[34:59] does not care about your doctrine,
[35:03] but only the message will bring you the
[35:06] revelation,
[35:09] of who you are.
[35:12] It is the revelation of your identity.
[35:25] Amen.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; The revelation of your identity
[35:29] is what Satan is afraid of.
[35:34] You see the the prophet said that if
[35:37] they will know if the church will know
[35:39] who she is
[35:41] and what she stands for and that she can
[35:44] do the greater works,
[35:47] she will be an invisible army.
[35:52] So that's the greatest thing we should
[35:53] pray for, revelation.
[35:58] And the Bible says
[36:00] Abraham believed God,
[36:03] and it was counted unto him for
[36:05] righteousness,
[36:08] not the righteousness of his works,
[36:11] but of that revelation he had received.
[36:16] Praise the Lord.
[36:19] There's a I want us to sing that song.
[36:22] It's a glorious church without spo.
[36:35] But if you are born again,
[36:38] you are alive. And if if you believe
[36:39] what I'm saying, just say amen. You are
[36:41] alive with Christ.
[36:43] And your affections is on things above.
[36:48] and not on things of the world. But if
[36:51] you are born again of the spirit of God,
[36:54] you become a part of God and you are
[36:57] eternal with him.
[37:00] Then death cannot touch you.
[37:03] When you are born again, you are
[37:05] eternal.
[37:08] You have changed from the creature of
[37:10] time
[37:12] to a creature of eternity.
[37:14] You have changed from death unto life.
[37:18] And the prophet says, I'm talking about
[37:20] eternal
[37:23] from eternal death
[37:26] to eternal life.
[37:29] As I'm standing here, I will have
[37:32] eternal life.
[37:34] And there is no amount of of devils
[37:38] can convince me otherwise.
[37:42] You know when you have received a
[37:43] revelation of who you are,
[37:46] nothing can prove you otherwise.
[37:49] Nothing can talk you out of it.
[37:53] If you have experienced something,
[37:56] nothing can prove you or talk you out of
[37:59] that experience.
[38:02] And I tell you friends,
[38:05] the greatest experience we can get
[38:09] is a revelation of who you are.
[38:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It's a glorious church
[38:18] without a spot wrinkle.
[38:26] Okay. Praise God.
[38:29] I was just I was just about to tell you
[38:31] that let's just go to another service
[38:33] and we just close it
[38:36] but I'm being told that the food is
[38:37] ready
[38:41] then I think uh you know there are those
[38:43] who have been you know traveling and you

[38:55] session after we have eaten and relaxed.
[39:00] we come back for the last session. I
[39:01] don't I know it would not be very long
[39:03] and
[39:04] trust me I know brother Michael I've
[39:06] heard him preach before
[39:09] not that I'm saying that you preach
[39:10] short
