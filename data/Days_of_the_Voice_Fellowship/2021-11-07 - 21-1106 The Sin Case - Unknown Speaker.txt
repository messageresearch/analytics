[Applause] knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it so in the days um he says you can eat of all the trees [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] and the [Applause] is what would he say chichi chinese hey [Applause] that you can receive someone from heaven which is different from what is in the bible [Music] [Applause] our good grandfather open it up and read it and the lord god said behold the man has begun as one of us to know good and evil and now unless he put forth his hand and take also on the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to deal the ground from where he was taken so he drove out the man and he blessed at the east of the garden of eden cherry blooms and a flaming sword which turned everywhere to keep the way of the tree of life [Music] foreign [Music] is you cannot die [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] yes [Applause] [Applause] jesus and now

[Applause] [Music] was speaking to me [Music] um um [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] is [Applause] away from him god knew the lord shall die and what did do you think it was easy for [Applause] [Music] condemn [Music] then after god saying those words there is nothing he could do the lord [Applause] [Applause] is ah [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] all of them are sinners by one sin by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed on upon all men for all for the for that all have sinned but sin is not imputed when there is no law actually whatever amen which means that there is [Applause] [Applause] that you are sinners [Music] [Applause] but the bible [Applause] foreign [Applause] yes [Applause] you know some people kind of believe well me i was born by uh parents who are believers [Music] religious is [Applause] [Applause] he says god looked down upon adam's foreign [Applause] he saw our condition grace and we decide we reject the object
