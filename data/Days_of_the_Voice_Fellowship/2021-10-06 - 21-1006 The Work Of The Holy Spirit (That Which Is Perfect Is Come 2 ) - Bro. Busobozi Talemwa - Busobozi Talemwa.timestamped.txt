[41:14] friday
[41:19] we have a
[41:21] a wedding there junior in baguio and
[41:25] also
[41:26] uh
[41:27] we have something else that is going to
[41:29] take place there it is
[42:13] you're welcome
[42:24] we have no uh membership but we have
[42:27] fellowship they're trying to remember
[42:28] what

[42:43] the second part of what i was speaking
[42:45] on
[42:46] on sunday
[42:49] [Music]
[42:54] i don't think it's a new it's just going
[42:56] to be the continuation
[43:01] of sunday so i want you to be sober
[43:02] because we have only one hour no reason
[43:07] and sometimes when the word is preached
[43:10] a bit fast fast
[43:16] uh pray for my interpreter is not used
[43:18] to interpreting
[43:23] for him
[43:25] amen amen all right so uh
[43:28] uh you know when when we are preaching
[43:30] very fast
[43:33] uh sometimes you may not get everything
[43:37] i know that it turns and that's one of
[43:39] the reasons why we record these meetings
[43:45] later when you have more time you can go
[43:46] back on youtube and begin to listen
[43:52] to youtube
[44:18] so
[44:19] this evening of course on sunday i was
[44:21] speaking on
[44:23] the
[44:24] that which is perfect is
[45:02] amen amen
[45:06] uh we have read in the book of daniel of
[45:08] course we read this question some of
[45:09] these beats we read them already in the
[45:10] previous services
[45:12] every single time someone called
[45:13] services
[45:14] but i wanted to follow me very well
[45:25] [Music]
[45:28] of course we'll take you deeper into the
[45:29] knowledge of the world
[45:33] but the purpose is meant to make you or
[45:36] to bring you into the right atmosphere
[45:38] to receive the holy spirit
[46:13] chapter 12 verse 1 and at that time
[46:15] shall michael stand up the great prince
[46:17] which standeth for the
[46:19] children of thy people
[46:21] and there shall be a time of trouble and
[46:24] such as never was since there was a
[46:26] nation even to that time even to that
[46:29] same time and at that time the people
[46:31] shall be delivered
[46:33] everyone that shall be found written in
[46:35] the book and many of them that sleep in
[46:38] that in the dust of the earth shall
[46:39] awake some everlasting life and some
[46:42] shame and everlasting content
[46:44] and they
[46:46] that be wise shall shine as the
[46:48] brightness of the family and they that
[46:51] turn out many righteousness as the stars
[46:53] forever and ever but thou o daniel shut
[46:57] up the words and seal the book even to
[46:59] the time of the end many shall run to
[47:01] and fro and knowledge shall be increased
[47:05] [Music]
[47:36] foreign
[48:16] foreign
[48:41] hallelujah amen now we noticed here in
[48:44] the book of daniel
[48:46] tulane
[49:01] how many do not understand
[49:03] english here today
[49:12] sorry
[49:14] whatever
[49:27] let me just
[49:28] use one language because i notice
[49:31] i may end up
[49:33] people may end up losing everything
[49:35] hallelujah
[49:37] all right
[49:39] so if there is someone online i know
[49:41] there are some people who fellowship
[49:42] with us and cannot understand english at
[49:45] all so if they are there they are just
[49:46] going to operate we are apologizing to
[49:48] them today
[49:49] so now we are speaking on
[49:52] the that which is uh that that which is
[49:55] perfect is come and
[49:59] how many have ever read the book of
[50:01] daniel here raise up your hand
[50:03] okay what about the book of revelation
[50:05] raise up your hand
[50:07] now the book of revelation and the book
[50:09] of daniel has much in common do you know
[50:11] why because the book of revelation
[50:14] speaks of the things that are the things
[50:18] which which we shall be and the things
[50:21] which was
[50:22] and daniel the book of daniel does the
[50:25] same thing so we notice here in the book
[50:27] of daniel chapter 12 the bible is
[50:29] speaking about the book which was sealed
[50:32] it was sealed and daniel of course the
[50:34] angel told him daniel shout out the
[50:36] words and seal the book even to the time
[50:39] of
[50:40] the end so meaning you remember we
[50:43] talked about this and i told you that
[50:44] there would come a time
[50:46] which would be the time of the end of
[50:49] the ceiling of the book
[50:51] and here give me revelation chapter five
[50:52] let us also read it now
[50:55] as you are giving me revelation chapter
[50:56] 5 we have also read the book of first
[50:59] corinthians chapter 13 verse 10 which
[51:02] says
[51:03] when that which is perfect is come
[51:06] that which is in part shall be done away
[51:11] hallelujah so we realized that it's
[51:12] going to be there was a time when there
[51:15] was something
[51:16] but when it was not yet perfect of
[51:18] course the time of paul i showed you
[51:20] that paul was the one who was laying the
[51:22] foundation of the church he was laying
[51:24] the foundation of faith but then there
[51:27] comes a time when perfection comes to
[51:29] the church and we know that perfection
[51:31] comes listen to this now that perfection
[51:34] of the church comes at the end of the
[51:37] ceiling of the book which was sealed in
[51:39] the book of daniel or which was sealed
[51:42] from we do not know when but that book
[51:44] was suit for a real long time so we said
[51:47] at that time the ceiling of that book
[51:49] will come to an end
[51:51] the people who will see the end
[51:54] of the ceiling of that book will be a
[51:56] blessed people
[51:58] the people who shall see in other words
[52:00] the opening of the book will be a
[52:03] blessed people
[52:04] and those people shall be called the
[52:06] people of the open book hallelujah
[52:09] amen they will not have a sealed book
[52:11] anymore but now there will be amen
[52:14] having a book which is now open
[52:17] hallelujah of course the mystery will be
[52:19] now open now look at revelation chapter
[52:21] five verse one to four you can follow
[52:24] unders
[52:26] on the screen here
[52:28] okay he says and i saw in the right hand
[52:30] of him that sat on the throne
[52:34] and i saw in the right hand of him that
[52:36] sat on the throne a book written within
[52:39] and on the back side please follow this
[52:41] sealed with seven seals
[52:44] and i saw a strong angel proclaiming
[52:46] with a loud voice
[52:48] who is worthy
[52:50] to open the book and to lose the seals
[52:52] they are on
[52:54] and and no man in heaven nor in earth
[52:57] neither under the earth was able to open
[52:59] the book neither to look there on
[53:02] have you seen that this is the same book
[53:04] that daniel
[53:06] saw
[53:07] this is the symbol that now john is also
[53:11] seeing
[53:12] hallelujah and what was the status of
[53:15] this book it was
[53:17] sealed
[53:18] it was not open yet it was sealed
[53:22] and
[53:23] verse 4 and i wept much because no man
[53:26] was found worthy
[53:29] to open
[53:31] and to read a book nay that looked there
[53:34] on
[53:35] i wanted to say some very important
[53:37] thing here no man on earth no man in
[53:40] heaven was worthy
[53:42] even today there is no matter that's why
[53:44] that's the very big difference that we
[53:47] in the message have
[53:49] with the denominations
[53:51] the denominations look at a man for
[53:54] leadership the denominations look at as
[53:57] a group of men for
[53:59] leadership but in the message we do not
[54:03] in the message we look to the one who
[54:05] was worthy
[54:06] because remember there was no man that
[54:08] was worthy
[54:10] therefore there is no man that can tell
[54:12] you what to do that will give you
[54:14] eternal life
[54:15] there is no man who was worthy to open
[54:17] the book and to lose the seals there is
[54:19] no man who was worthy to bring
[54:21] redemption by the way this closed book
[54:24] was a a book brother banh called it the
[54:26] book of redemption
[54:29] hallelujah
[54:32] and so
[54:36] the catholic church has a man that they
[54:38] look up to
[54:40] and that man
[54:41] is the one who will
[54:43] tell you whether you are a saint or not
[54:46] but i'm glad when you receive this man
[54:48] of the bible the man who are talking
[54:50] about the one who was working we shall
[54:51] find out who he is amen when you receive
[54:54] him when you accept him when you even
[54:56] follow his words amen his words make you
[54:58] a saint even before you die
[55:01] we don't have to die to become a saint
[55:03] and we don't need someone else to tell
[55:04] us we are saints whether we are dead or
[55:07] alive and remember your death does not
[55:09] change you death only changes your
[55:11] wedding place amen if you die if when
[55:14] you are a sinner you remain a sinner if
[55:17] you die as saint you remain ashamed you
[55:20] cannot be a sinner on earth and then you
[55:22] die and someone make you a saint no
[55:25] therefore we are so glad that this
[55:27] morning i aim and this evening i'm
[55:28] speaking to saints
[55:30] we are saints hallelujah we don't need
[55:33] to die to become saints we are saints
[55:35] only because we have accepted the one
[55:37] who was worthy
[55:39] we are saved because we have received
[55:41] the one amen who was worthy to open the
[55:43] book and to lose the seals thereof
[55:46] some people have thought that the one
[55:48] who was whether to open the book and
[55:49] lose the seals was by the parliament no
[55:51] he wasn't
[55:52] remember he said there was no
[55:54] man hallelujah
[55:56] there was no one in heaven no one on
[55:58] earth not even angel gapier not even
[56:01] angel michael not even mary magdalene or
[56:03] mary whoever
[56:04] not even marry the mother of jesus
[56:06] christ not even any prophet not even
[56:08] ezekiel not even daddy not even isaiah
[56:10] not even brother burn i'm not even
[56:12] anyone
[56:14] there was no man not any pastor bishop
[56:17] or whoever that you think some people
[56:19] even they have names but abandoned calls
[56:22] them uh
[56:24] famous names
[56:26] i told you that sometimes you want to
[56:29] call someone and to refer to them you
[56:31] have to first do that before you speak
[56:34] their name you have to put a
[56:37] title that will take almost a full page
[56:40] bishop apostle
[56:42] evangelist reverend doctor
[56:45] phd
[56:46] and then
[56:48] before you know you you know it has
[56:50] other titles and then now you say even
[56:52] the name has a hd then
[56:57] almost they will not mention the name
[57:00] hallelujah
[57:01] they have famous names
[57:04] but what about the one who was worthy
[57:06] amen he is simply called jesus
[57:09] hallelujah
[57:11] not dr jesus just jesus
[57:14] hallelujah
[57:16] and i tell you he is the only one who
[57:18] was worthy amen to check the book and to
[57:20] lose the seals thereof
[57:22] amen and we see here
[57:24] the reason why i read uh corinthians
[57:26] first christians because it says that
[57:29] which is perfect is
[57:32] come when that which is perfect is
[57:36] that was a prophecy
[57:39] amen paul was not speaking something
[57:41] which has already happened paul was not
[57:43] saying that which is perfect is come
[57:46] paul was saying when that which is
[57:48] perfect is come
[57:50] amen paul was saying now we are
[57:52] preaching in part now we have half
[57:55] prophecy but there is time coming when
[57:58] the end of the prophecy will come when
[58:01] the whole prophecy will be fulfilled and
[58:04] that is the time of the end of the
[58:06] ceiling of the book are you getting it
[58:09] that time of the end hallelujah when the
[58:12] book will be opened when the sales will
[58:14] be loosed amen then you can have an open
[58:16] book and therefore that which is perfect
[58:19] will come at that time
[58:21] hallelujah in other words he was
[58:23] prophesying of something to come he was
[58:26] talking of something to come and i tell
[58:28] you that thing does not come until the
[58:30] end amen of the of the ceiling of the
[58:33] book comes
[58:35] and i want us to look at verse
[58:37] revelation chapter 10 and i know i went
[58:40] through these things but i have to keep
[58:41] going through them until we'll capture
[58:43] the revelation i want to look at
[58:45] revelation chapter 10 verse 1 to 7.
[58:57] hallelujah
[58:59] and i saw another mighty angel
[59:02] come down from heaven crossed with a
[59:03] cloud and a rainbow was upon his head
[59:06] and his face was as it were the sun and
[59:09] his feet as pillars of fire and he had
[59:12] in his hand a little book open and he
[59:14] set his right foot upon the sea and his
[59:17] left foot on the earth
[59:19] who did he see
[59:22] are you following
[59:23] who did you see
[59:26] read it the way you see it who did you
[59:28] see
[59:29] another
[59:30] mighty angel
[59:34] amen where did he come down from
[59:37] from heaven
[59:39] who is this angel he is the angel who
[59:41] was close with a cloud and he's also the
[59:43] angel who had a rainbow around upon his
[59:46] head
[59:48] his feet was actually the sun and his
[59:50] feet was a pill of fire now let me tell
[59:51] you who this angel is
[59:53] this is the same angel
[59:56] that represents what john
[59:59] saw
[1:00:00] in revelation chapter 5
[1:00:03] you are going to switch back to
[1:00:04] revelation chapter 5 quickly now
[1:00:06] revelation chapter 5 look at that
[1:00:10] these are certain things that we as a
[1:00:12] church need to understand very very well
[1:00:17] okay i didn't have it here i was just
[1:00:20] relying on you brother
[1:00:21] look at look at that revelation chapter
[1:00:23] 5
[1:00:24] verses
[1:00:26] 5.
[1:00:29] okay
[1:00:30] right there
[1:00:36] okay
[1:00:38] whoever has their phone off
[1:00:44] and one of the elders said unto me
[1:00:47] whip not of course john wept much
[1:00:49] because because he found he found no one
[1:00:52] that was worthy to open and to read the
[1:00:54] book
[1:00:55] neither to look their own there was no
[1:00:57] one worthy okay because john found no
[1:01:00] one was worthy
[1:01:01] he now wept much
[1:01:04] because no man was found worthy
[1:01:07] amen that's why i get the part of man
[1:01:09] there was no man
[1:01:11] found worthy to open and to read the
[1:01:15] book
[1:01:15] they are on so
[1:01:17] john wept march
[1:01:21] and one of the elders said unto me weep
[1:01:24] not behold the lion of the tribe of
[1:01:26] judah the root of david has prevailed to
[1:01:29] open the book and lose the seven seals
[1:01:32] there
[1:01:33] oh
[1:01:35] hallelujah so now this was a book amen
[1:01:38] keep that there this was a book that was
[1:01:41] sealed with seven seals
[1:01:45] and there was no man worthy
[1:01:47] to open the book
[1:01:49] no to look there upon
[1:01:53] and because of that the bible says that
[1:01:55] john wept much because there was no man
[1:01:58] worthy
[1:02:01] so there was no one whether to lose the
[1:02:03] seals to remove the seals to open the
[1:02:06] book and the book was closed
[1:02:09] why because that time of the end of the
[1:02:12] mystery
[1:02:13] had not yet come
[1:02:15] there was a time even before the
[1:02:18] foundation of the world in the mind of
[1:02:20] god when the end of the time of the end
[1:02:23] of the mystery of this seventh sealed
[1:02:25] book would come
[1:02:28] that time amen would be amen the capping
[1:02:31] off of the church
[1:02:33] remember we found out
[1:02:35] in
[1:02:36] you know some of you have just come in
[1:02:38] may not understand
[1:02:39] but
[1:02:40] if you listen to the services on youtube
[1:02:42] before you understand where we are
[1:02:44] but you will notice
[1:02:46] that the church has been in building
[1:02:49] from level one level to the other
[1:02:51] hallelujah i don't know if i have this
[1:02:53] picture maybe just give you a small
[1:02:55] picture of what i'm speaking about
[1:02:59] hallelujah
[1:03:01] let's see if i can be able to do that i
[1:03:03] did not uh prepare to show it to you
[1:03:05] again today so you'll excuse me if i
[1:03:07] cannot get it quickly
[1:03:10] do you have a picture brother
[1:03:22] hallelujah
[1:03:26] okay so it looks like i am not going to
[1:03:28] be able to show you that picture because
[1:03:31] i did not prepare but some of you
[1:03:33] you can see that there
[1:03:35] right there
[1:03:37] on the on the on the station of the
[1:03:40] perfect man that that picture which has
[1:03:42] a statue of a perfect man you see it
[1:03:44] goes from faith on down to
[1:03:48] charity
[1:03:49] to god to love perfect love
[1:03:52] and it has been from the ages from the
[1:03:55] very first age to the second edge third
[1:03:58] age fourth a fifth hey look
[1:04:00] why am i talking about what i'm talking
[1:04:01] about
[1:04:04] people
[1:04:05] are lost because of lack of
[1:04:09] knowledge
[1:04:10] we need to understand what time we are
[1:04:12] living in
[1:04:14] people are just christians without even
[1:04:16] knowing where they are going where they
[1:04:17] are coming from what they are supposed
[1:04:18] to do now
[1:04:20] we find out in the book in the bible
[1:04:22] here
[1:04:23] one great prophet one of the prophets we
[1:04:25] know was a mighty prophet and his name
[1:04:27] is daniel
[1:04:29] the bible tells me he was able to know
[1:04:32] by the books of another prophet
[1:04:35] what time they were living in
[1:04:37] hallelujah he was able to take him in
[1:04:40] the book of signatures of prophet isaiah
[1:04:42] and he read and he found out how he was
[1:04:45] at the time of the ending of israel on
[1:04:48] israel being out of our homeland
[1:04:50] it was the last last year it was the
[1:04:52] last season
[1:04:54] amen but it was out of match from out of
[1:04:57] much crying and praying and interceding
[1:04:59] for his people
[1:05:02] he had this burden he needed to know
[1:05:04] what time is he living in you remember
[1:05:06] the other day the other time i asked i
[1:05:07] told you of someone who asked
[1:05:10] a baby who asked a big person who had
[1:05:13] come actually to preach in their home
[1:05:15] he said
[1:05:18] which generation are we in and the big
[1:05:20] man said pretty much we are in the
[1:05:22] mutavis generation
[1:05:25] some people think that way
[1:05:27] we are immutably generation pretty much
[1:05:30] look we need to know what is the what
[1:05:33] generation are we living in what time
[1:05:36] are we living in do we believe in the
[1:05:38] coming of the lord is he coming when is
[1:05:41] it coming
[1:05:42] what sign shall we see
[1:05:44] what things will happen
[1:05:46] is the end of the world coming oh it is
[1:05:48] not coming
[1:05:49] some people think because the world has
[1:05:50] been continuing on for ages it's going
[1:05:52] to continue like this and this others
[1:05:54] even believe there is no end
[1:05:57] others believe we shall
[1:05:59] be extinct and then after another nation
[1:06:01] another human race will come you know
[1:06:03] people have all sorts of ideas and
[1:06:06] ideologies on what is going to happen
[1:06:08] why because they do not read the bible
[1:06:11] but i tell you this bible here amen has
[1:06:13] all the mysteries in it
[1:06:15] and there are people ordaining every
[1:06:18] generation to understand the time
[1:06:19] they're living in
[1:06:22] and when they understand it even they
[1:06:24] seize the moment and after they seize
[1:06:27] the moment they prepare themselves for
[1:06:29] what is coming and we know what is
[1:06:31] coming hallelujah we know the coming of
[1:06:33] the lord is right here amen we know he's
[1:06:35] coming soon how many believe that
[1:06:40] now let me tell you
[1:06:42] according to prophecy
[1:06:44] this sealed book would
[1:06:46] no longer be sealed
[1:06:48] but that time of its end
[1:06:50] to be sealed
[1:06:52] would come
[1:06:54] but there are certain things we would
[1:06:56] know that that end has come
[1:07:00] and that's what we are trying to look at
[1:07:03] now
[1:07:04] john wept
[1:07:05] give me that verse again verse 5 chapter
[1:07:07] 5 and when john wept
[1:07:09] then a voice told him that weep not john
[1:07:13] for the lion of the tribe of judas
[1:07:14] prevailed
[1:07:17] and then when john turned to see the
[1:07:18] lion of the tribe of judah what did he
[1:07:21] see brother
[1:07:24] what did he see
[1:07:25] he saw
[1:07:27] he's so alarmed as he it was slain when
[1:07:32] please answer me now
[1:07:33] before the foundation of the world
[1:07:35] hallelujah
[1:07:37] he's so alarmed he did not only see a
[1:07:39] lamb but he's so alone full of blood
[1:07:43] and when did that lamb get bloody when
[1:07:45] was it killed islam was not alive it was
[1:07:48] a dead lamb and he saw that islam was
[1:07:51] killed before even the foundation of the
[1:07:54] world
[1:07:56] amen who is that lamb that lamb is jesus
[1:07:59] christ
[1:08:00] the lamb of god who takes away the sins
[1:08:03] of the world
[1:08:04] when was jesus killed he was killed
[1:08:06] before you were born when was he killed
[1:08:08] he was killed before the foundation of
[1:08:10] the world
[1:08:11] which means amen when did we
[1:08:14] when when were we redeemed when were we
[1:08:17] saved we were actually saved
[1:08:20] listen to this now we were actually
[1:08:22] saved before the foundation of the world
[1:08:27] hallelujah
[1:08:29] here we are here only to recognize who
[1:08:32] we are
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:35] some people prayed
[1:08:37] when someone becomes saved oh god remove
[1:08:40] his name from the book of death and
[1:08:42] place it in the name in the book of life
[1:08:45] this is no sense
[1:08:47] your name has never been in the book of
[1:08:49] death never
[1:08:51] your name has always been on the book of
[1:08:53] life
[1:08:54] hallelujah
[1:08:56] and let me even take it a step further
[1:08:58] your name was on the lamb's book of life
[1:09:02] before the foundation of the world but
[1:09:04] you was in sin you were born in sin
[1:09:07] shaped in iniquity not you but actually
[1:09:09] your flesh
[1:09:11] hallelujah
[1:09:12] amen and when you came amen you heard
[1:09:15] from your theophany your friend is the
[1:09:18] other body which was not a sinner
[1:09:20] which had never seen that part of you
[1:09:22] which was always godly amen but it left
[1:09:25] you
[1:09:26] you were separated from it because of
[1:09:29] the way you were born you are born out
[1:09:30] of the lust
[1:09:32] of the flesh and you are born in sin and
[1:09:35] so when you hear the word of god you
[1:09:37] recognize hey i was wrong i was a sinner
[1:09:40] then you repent by the time you repent
[1:09:42] amen you are reunited hallelujah
[1:09:45] with the person that you really was
[1:09:47] supposed to be
[1:09:49] hallelujah
[1:09:51] all that is the work of the holy spirit
[1:09:53] not the work of man actually when by the
[1:09:55] time we are done with this you will see
[1:09:57] that redemption and salvation is not the
[1:09:59] work of a man redemption and salvation
[1:10:01] is the work of the holy ghost
[1:10:04] that is why without the holy ghost you
[1:10:06] can never see god without the holy
[1:10:08] spirit you can never be saved without
[1:10:10] the holy spirit you can never go in the
[1:10:12] rapture
[1:10:14] amen hallelujah and so we see that this
[1:10:18] book
[1:10:19] was sealed
[1:10:20] but you see when john came to see when
[1:10:23] the voice told him
[1:10:27] i'll leave that part
[1:10:29] i think i'll explain in the coming
[1:10:31] meetings you see who this elder was but
[1:10:33] let me just proceed he says when when
[1:10:35] one of the elders told him he said
[1:10:38] weep not john the lion of the time of
[1:10:40] jesus prevailed and when he turned to
[1:10:41] see the lion who had prevailed he saw a
[1:10:44] lamb as it was trained before the
[1:10:46] foundation of the world and that lamb i
[1:10:47] told you was jesus christ
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] his coming on the cross was a
[1:10:54] fulfillment of what he had already done
[1:10:57] remember his thought
[1:11:00] before it becomes a word is a thought
[1:11:03] and before
[1:11:05] before it actually happens he has
[1:11:07] already predetermined it
[1:11:10] and we say that the lamb went on the
[1:11:12] cross and died for us
[1:11:14] and that's when he lose the book
[1:11:16] but when he lose the book
[1:11:20] the seals
[1:11:22] did not become opened before the eyes of
[1:11:25] the people
[1:11:26] the people were still sitting across the
[1:11:28] book why because their eyes were blind
[1:11:31] jesus came and told them you have eyes
[1:11:33] but you can't see
[1:11:35] in other words i am the lamb who has
[1:11:37] come to open the book but you can't see
[1:11:40] because they were calling him
[1:11:41] they were calling him head of demons
[1:11:43] but they did not know this was the very
[1:11:45] one that was prophesied in their scrolls
[1:11:48] in their verses that they read in their
[1:11:50] temples every day they did not know it
[1:11:53] was he that was prophesied that he would
[1:11:56] come they did not even have an idea that
[1:11:58] this is the lamb of god that takes away
[1:12:00] the sins of the world they didn't have
[1:12:01] an idea that this is the one daniel
[1:12:03] talked about amen they didn't have an
[1:12:05] idea this was the one isaiah talked
[1:12:07] about all the prophets talked about he
[1:12:09] had now come to fulfill his work of
[1:12:12] prophecy
[1:12:14] amen his work which was written after
[1:12:16] him or before him
[1:12:19] he had now come to fulfill it and they
[1:12:20] called him the head of demons they did
[1:12:22] not know who he was
[1:12:24] and to them the book remained sealed
[1:12:28] and the book has remained sealed to them
[1:12:29] until today
[1:12:31] the book has remained still until today
[1:12:34] they have this bible but i tell you this
[1:12:36] bible to them is a closed book
[1:12:39] they can't understand it
[1:12:41] amen but in every generation there is a
[1:12:44] group of people who will understand who
[1:12:46] will see the book open to them
[1:12:50] amen they have the bible but they can't
[1:12:53] see it he said you have eyes but you
[1:12:55] can't see
[1:12:56] you have ears but you can't hear why
[1:12:58] because their ears are closed their eyes
[1:13:01] are closed they are blind as a bat
[1:13:04] oh my
[1:13:06] how can they not see
[1:13:08] that baptism
[1:13:10] is supposed to be in the name of our
[1:13:11] lord jesus christ
[1:13:14] how can they claim
[1:13:16] they're in churches
[1:13:18] i say the churches
[1:13:19] don't live in a classroom like this one
[1:13:21] but i mean they're mega churches so
[1:13:23] called
[1:13:24] and
[1:13:25] they come to bring a choir and it's all
[1:13:28] about entertaining people
[1:13:30] they are dressed to impress you do you
[1:13:32] hear what i say they are dressed to kill
[1:13:35] they are dressed to impress
[1:13:37] the the the people
[1:13:40] it's all about
[1:13:41] a show
[1:13:43] you know like what you said let us go to
[1:13:44] a show it's a show
[1:13:46] even when a preacher comes he doesn't
[1:13:48] come to heal the sick but he comes to
[1:13:50] make a show
[1:13:52] so it can be shown on the tv
[1:13:55] show
[1:13:56] so that the people can bring in money
[1:13:58] amen they are blind they can't see that
[1:14:01] these things is nowhere in the scripture
[1:14:05] they are forgotten about holiness
[1:14:08] these things of saying that a boy should
[1:14:09] not touch a girl until marriage those
[1:14:11] things they can't understand it say what
[1:14:14] you mean you have no girlfriend you know
[1:14:16] they used to call you a fool in the
[1:14:17] world you mean you have no girlfriend at
[1:14:18] your age you're 20 and you have no
[1:14:20] girlfriend say well i have no one why
[1:14:23] because i'm not yet ready to marry you
[1:14:24] don't need to be ready to matter you
[1:14:26] only have to you need to have a
[1:14:27] girlfriend because you're of age
[1:14:30] that thing is to be worldly but these
[1:14:31] days even in the churches you find them
[1:14:33] having girlfriends and boyfriends
[1:14:35] show me anyone in the bible who was a
[1:14:37] girlfriend of someone the boyfriend of
[1:14:39] someone
[1:14:40] the only one we know is mary
[1:14:43] and
[1:14:44] joseph and these were not only a
[1:14:46] girlfriend and boyfriend but they were
[1:14:47] exposed to one another they were engaged
[1:14:50] to one another everyone knew about it
[1:14:53] it wasn't a secret affair
[1:14:56] but you see why are these things
[1:14:58] happening in the church today why
[1:15:00] because their eyes are closed
[1:15:03] they are blinded
[1:15:06] why do you find
[1:15:07] people baptizing babies children
[1:15:10] in the name of the holy trinity
[1:15:14] even the so-called pentecostals father
[1:15:16] son holy ghost they are doing the same
[1:15:18] thing of the catholic church there's
[1:15:20] catholicism everywhere
[1:15:22] when where do you find the trinity here
[1:15:24] it's nowhere to differ why do they do
[1:15:26] those things because they are blind they
[1:15:28] are reading from a closed book
[1:15:30] they can't understand it
[1:15:32] but in every generation like i said
[1:15:35] there are people that god by his grace
[1:15:38] amen will open the mystery too they will
[1:15:40] understand it
[1:15:42] hallelujah i mean it happened in the
[1:15:45] first age it happened in the second age
[1:15:47] they thought the fourth until the sick
[1:15:49] when it reaches the seventh age amen you
[1:15:51] know what is going to happen by the
[1:15:53] polycarp the end of the whole mystery
[1:15:57] hallelujah he was opening mystery one by
[1:15:59] one but by the end amen of the ages
[1:16:03] the whole mystery of god hallelujah
[1:16:06] would be unveiled
[1:16:09] i want you to look at
[1:16:12] revelation 10 now verse 1.
[1:16:17] and i saw another mighty angel come down
[1:16:19] from heaven
[1:16:20] close to the cloud
[1:16:22] and that rainbow was upon his head and
[1:16:23] his face was it was as it was the sun
[1:16:25] and his feet has been as a fire
[1:16:29] and he had in his
[1:16:31] hand a little book open
[1:16:33] and he set his right foot
[1:16:35] upon the sea and he left food on the
[1:16:37] earth
[1:16:38] who is this angel
[1:16:40] hallelujah
[1:16:42] who is this angel i asked
[1:16:44] do you know who this angel
[1:16:47] this angel was jesus christ
[1:16:51] this is the same lamb that we see
[1:16:53] in the book of revelation chapter 5
[1:16:55] verse 5.
[1:16:57] it's the same one
[1:16:59] but this time
[1:17:01] are you following me
[1:17:03] in revelation 10
[1:17:05] he now comes down with our open
[1:17:08] book
[1:17:12] he comes to declare hallelujah you know
[1:17:15] what what happens in the heavens
[1:17:18] happens here on earth it shows what is
[1:17:20] happening on the earth
[1:17:21] and this happened at one time in america
[1:17:25] in uh not to say the literal scripture
[1:17:26] but
[1:17:27] it's the symbol of it in the 19 i
[1:17:30] believe 1963 it was yes
[1:17:33] in february
[1:17:35] 1963
[1:17:37] they made a magazine it's called life
[1:17:39] magazine and that there was a cloud
[1:17:42] that
[1:17:43] was photographed in america
[1:17:46] 1963 i wish i had it but maybe
[1:17:49] in the next meeting i'll prepare it
[1:17:51] and that life magazine
[1:17:54] had both the
[1:17:55] crowd
[1:17:57] and the rainbow
[1:17:59] over it like this
[1:18:01] these people who are doing who
[1:18:03] photograph this and put it in the paper
[1:18:04] were not believers
[1:18:06] but
[1:18:07] the cloud appeared at a place where
[1:18:10] there is no moisture to say that
[1:18:12] moisture can happen to form a cloud
[1:18:15] this thing happened there because it was
[1:18:18] supernatural
[1:18:19] showing and you know what that cloud was
[1:18:21] a crowd overhead
[1:18:24] you remember what i was telling you the
[1:18:25] body was now mature in maturing until
[1:18:28] the time even when the head comes and
[1:18:30] rests on the body
[1:18:32] from that time when that cloud
[1:18:35] you know that rainbow appeared there was
[1:18:37] something at that same season happening
[1:18:38] on the earth
[1:18:40] it was in 1963 who was born then raise
[1:18:43] up your hand here
[1:18:45] no one was born there
[1:18:48] but it is in history it is known
[1:18:50] everybody knows it
[1:18:52] that is the same time when god was
[1:18:54] calling his servant a man
[1:18:57] in america
[1:18:59] and he was at that same season at that
[1:19:02] same time
[1:19:03] going to preach on the revelation of the
[1:19:05] seven seals
[1:19:07] and god had already prepared him
[1:19:10] for some time for this to happen
[1:19:12] are you following me
[1:19:15] now
[1:19:16] i wanted to look at that bus very well
[1:19:23] brother are you giving it to me
[1:19:25] chapter 10 verse
[1:19:29] yes
[1:19:30] verse 2 and he had in his hand a little
[1:19:33] book open
[1:19:34] and he set his right foot upon the sea
[1:19:37] and he is left foot on the earth
[1:19:40] and he cried with a loud voice
[1:19:42] as a when a lion roared and when he had
[1:19:44] cried i was going to lie in it
[1:19:47] and when he had cried hand has uttered
[1:19:51] their voices
[1:19:52] and when the seven thunders had uttered
[1:19:55] their voices
[1:19:57] john was about to write
[1:20:00] and when
[1:20:01] he had the voice meaning john had a
[1:20:03] voice from heaven saying unto me
[1:20:05] at the same time when john had the voice
[1:20:07] when the seventh hand has uttered their
[1:20:09] voices john was going to what
[1:20:12] what does it mean it means that when the
[1:20:14] seventh time has acted it was it wasn't
[1:20:16] just something
[1:20:18] like that but it had a meaning to it so
[1:20:21] there was contents of these standards
[1:20:24] that were uttering and john was about to
[1:20:26] write the contents of the seven thunders
[1:20:28] which he had
[1:20:29] uttering their voices and then a voice
[1:20:32] from heaven came unto him saying seal up
[1:20:35] those things which the seventh thunders
[1:20:37] uttered and
[1:20:38] write them note
[1:20:41] don't write the contents of the seven
[1:20:43] standards
[1:20:46] don't write them seal them up
[1:20:48] now some people have sought to even say
[1:20:51] these seven thunders is different from
[1:20:53] the seals and therefore it is nothing to
[1:20:55] do with what the seventh angel messenger
[1:20:57] will do
[1:20:58] but my purpose here is to show you even
[1:21:01] that when this when when god said the
[1:21:04] last day messenger
[1:21:07] amen he will finish the mystery of god
[1:21:11] and actually in the church

[1:21:19] the the
[1:21:20] church edge book yes

[1:21:24] that spot for you here i don't have it
[1:21:25] in my front here but it was saying that
[1:21:29] the seventh angel messenger

[1:22:15] denominations

[1:24:03] forever and ever who created heaven and
[1:24:05] earth this angel who came with my angel
[1:24:08] around his head and he had
[1:24:10] what else
[1:24:13] rainbow
[1:24:14] around
[1:24:15] is that of course this shows that he was
[1:24:16] the age of the covenant
[1:24:18] amen and so that is jesus christ how we
[1:24:20] are able to know he is jesus christ
[1:24:23] and he swore
[1:24:25] so sweet brother gave us that verse he
[1:24:27] says listen to this amen

[1:24:47] her and the earth and the sin that
[1:24:49] they are in uh and the sea and the
[1:24:52] things that are in

[1:24:57] this is what he was saying that
[1:24:59] no matter what happens he is swearing by
[1:25:01] himself he swear and he said there
[1:25:04] should be time
[1:25:06] no longer
[1:25:09] hallelujah
[1:25:11] now that does not mean the end of all
[1:25:13] things and
[1:25:14] the destruction of the world but it only
[1:25:16] means that time for the sealed book to
[1:25:19] remain sealed is no longer
[1:25:22] hallelujah it is time for the seven
[1:25:25] seals now to be open
[1:25:28] the time of silence is over

[1:26:58] perfection of the world things and
[1:27:00] perfection there is perfection

[1:27:12] their skills
[1:27:14] their denominations are perfecting their
[1:27:16] skills

[1:27:21] perfecting their skills
[1:27:22] these men these men they can fake people
[1:27:25] and steal millions and people still go
[1:27:27] there widely because these men have
[1:27:28] perfected their skills
[1:27:31] but in the same way god is also
[1:27:32] perfecting his church
[1:27:34] hallelujah we have come to perfection we
[1:27:38] are no longer seeing through our class

[1:28:54] when these days of the seventh angel
[1:28:56] comes of the voice of the seventh angel
[1:28:58] he says the mystery of god shall be
[1:29:01] finished
