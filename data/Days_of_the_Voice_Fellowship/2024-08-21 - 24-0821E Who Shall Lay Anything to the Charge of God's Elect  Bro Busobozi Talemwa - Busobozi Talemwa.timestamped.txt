[31:24] thir that we may hear from you that you

[32:06] 8 vers
[32:17] 31 amen amen if you're there just say
[32:21] Amen
[32:26] so uh
[32:28] will
[32:33] begin okay can begin from 31 what shall
[32:36] we what shall we then say to the to
[32:39] these things if God be for us who can be
[32:42] against
[32:44] [Music]
[32:51] us he that spared not his own son but
[32:55] delivered him up for us all all how
[32:58] shall he then not with him also freely
[33:03] give us all
[33:06] [Music]
[33:15] things who shall lay anything to the
[33:18] charge of God's elect it is God that
[33:22] justifi
[33:24] [Music]
[33:33] who is he that condemn condemneth it is
[33:38] Christ that died yeah rather that is
[33:41] risen again who is even at the right
[33:43] hand of God who also maketh intercession
[33:46] for us
[34:05] what it
[34:06] is amen amen I'd like us
[34:12] to also look at vers
[34:16] 35 who shall separate us from the love
[34:19] of Christ shall tribulation or distress
[34:22] or persecution or famine or nakedness or
[34:26] Peril or sword
[34:40] vers
[34:41] 37 nay in all these things we are more
[34:45] than conquerors through him that loved
[34:54] us for I am persuaded that neither day
[34:57] death no life No Angels no
[35:00] principalities no powers no things
[35:02] present no things to come no height no
[35:05] depth nor any other creature shall be
[35:08] able to separate us from the love of God
[35:11] which is in Christ Jesus our lord
[35:35] [Music]
[35:45] say you may be
[35:48] seated praise the
[35:51] Lord so this
[35:54] evening I'm I'm having a small sharing
[35:59] and I'd like to speak on who shall lay
[36:02] anything to the charge of God's
[36:12] elect actually if you want to see it
[36:14] it's on vers
[36:17] 33 where it says who shall lay anything
[36:20] to the charge of God is
[36:22] [Music]
[36:26] elect and um uh it is God that
[36:32] justifi so I'm speaking on who shall lay
[36:34] anything to the charge of God
[36:42] El and maybe for an inspiration is
[36:48] Justified I'm
[36:50] Justified all charges
[36:54] dismissed tell your neighbor I'm
[36:56] Justified
[36:59] all charges
[37:01] dismissed hallelujah how many believe
[37:04] that amen praise the name of the Lord so
[37:08] today I just want us to um have a few
[37:10] minutes maybe of course less than one
[37:12] hour because um about 54
[37:17] minutes whenever we are speaking to
[37:19] evening light we do not go more than one
[37:24] hour I know there are some who stream
[37:26] and they be like like Pastor you were
[37:28] just beginning and then you you
[37:32] stopped so but uh we trust that this
[37:35] little sharing will be a blessing to to
[37:37] you
[37:40] tonight
[37:42] amen now first of all I want to speak on
[37:45] um the love of
[37:49] God how how many love God
[37:52] here can you prove it you can only prove
[37:56] that you love God
[37:59] if you obey his
[38:01] word but how can God prove that he loves
[38:06] us God can only prove that he loves
[38:10] us because he chose
[38:13] you that's the only way God can prove
[38:16] his love
[38:18] for and I'll begin with a quote here
[38:20] from thean church
[38:24] ede and I read this portion when I was
[38:26] speaking on the proof of of God's
[38:31] love so I'll read it again
[38:34] tonight now the Lord God Almighty says I
[38:39] know this is when he was speaking to the
[38:42] church agent said I Know Thy works I
[38:44] know your
[38:47] [Music]
[38:49] tribulation the church was suffering the
[38:51] church was going through a
[38:55] tribulation but the only thing that
[38:57] Jesus said
[38:58] said he said I
[39:01] know he said I know so he let them go
[39:05] through the
[39:06] tribulation he let them go through the
[39:10] suffering but then he simply said I
[39:14] know he never did pull them out of the
[39:17] suffering he never did pull them out of
[39:19] the troubles they were going
[39:21] through and this offends many
[39:24] people because then they ask questions
[39:26] like if God was really caring why if God
[39:29] loves Humanity why does he let them go
[39:31] through
[39:32] [Music]
[39:36] trouble if God loves human beings why
[39:39] did he let Satan
[39:43] come why didn't he just destroy
[39:46] him so that mankind can be
[39:49] saved but he simply says I know what I'm
[39:52] going
[39:53] through and there he is walking in the
[39:56] midst of his people
[39:58] there he is the chief Shepherd of the
[40:02] flock but does he hold back the
[40:06] persecution does he stem the
[40:10] tribulation no he does not he simply
[40:14] says I know your
[40:17] tribulation I am not at all unmindful of
[40:20] your
[40:23] suffering what a stumbling block this is
[40:25] to so many people
[40:29] like Israel they wonder if God really
[40:31] loves
[40:33] them I wonder if there is someone here
[40:35] this evening that has been wondering
[40:36] whether really God loves
[40:40] them because you have questions if God
[40:43] loves me why why this why that why
[40:46] that but you see how can God be just and
[40:49] loving if he stands by and watches me
[40:52] suffer
[40:57] that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1
[41:01] verse
[41:05] 1-3 which says the burden of the word of
[41:07] the Lord to Israel by
[41:11] Malachi I have loved you sayth the
[41:15] Lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved
[41:19] us was not es Jacob's brother sayith the
[41:24] Lord yet I loved Jacob
[41:27] and I hated
[41:29] Esau and I laid his mountains and his
[41:32] Heritage waste for the dragons of the
[41:39] Wilderness and and he says I loved Jacob
[41:42] and I hated
[41:45] es you see they could not figure out
[41:48] God's
[41:50] love of course this scripture was
[41:52] speaking to
[41:54] Israel and God was telling them look if
[41:56] you're saying I don't love
[41:58] you I loved Jacob and I hated
[42:02] es and of course Israel was out of
[42:06] Jacob of course we know Jacob was
[42:08] changed his name to
[42:11] Israel so he was the patriarch there so
[42:15] so he's proving to
[42:16] them that he loved Jacob and he hated
[42:21] Esau you see they couldn't figure out
[42:24] God's
[42:25] love they thought that love and I I have
[42:28] to finish reading this quot they thought
[42:30] that love meant no
[42:34] suffering they thought that love meant a
[42:36] baby with parental
[42:40] care but God said that his love was
[42:43] elective
[42:47] love yes the proof of his
[42:51] love is
[42:53] election that no matter what happen
[42:58] his love was proven truly by the fact
[43:00] that they were chosen unto
[43:05] salvation God has proven or proved his
[43:08] love for
[43:10] me by the fact that he chose me unto
[43:15] salvation he chose me to be
[43:17] saved are you following me church
[43:20] because God has chosen you to
[43:24] Salvation through sanctification
[43:28] of the
[43:30] spirit I wonder if the St can be reduced
[43:33] is quite a lot okay listen it says
[43:35] because God has chosen you to Salvation
[43:37] through sanctification of the
[43:41] spirit you you have to say this to
[43:44] yourself God chose me to s to
[43:49] Salvation through sanctification of the
[43:53] spirit and belief of the
[43:55] truth he commit you to death as he did
[44:00] Paul he may commit you to suffering as
[44:02] he did
[44:05] job did God love
[44:07] Paul did God love
[44:10] job and yet Paul
[44:12] died he was killed and yet job died he
[44:16] suffered a lot of suffering that is his
[44:22] prerogative God decides what each of us
[44:24] goes through in this life
[44:27] we even say some through the
[44:30] waters some through the fire but all
[44:33] through the
[44:35] blood that is his prerogative what we go
[44:39] through God is
[44:41] Sovereign but it is all with a
[44:45] purpose tell your neighbor everything is
[44:47] for a
[44:49] purpose if you did not have a
[44:52] purpose then he would have been the
[44:54] author of frustration and not of
[45:00] but his purpose
[45:02] is that after we have suffered a
[45:07] while we would be made
[45:10] perfect we would be
[45:12] established we would be strengthened and
[45:15] we would be set
[45:17] on as job said he put strength in
[45:22] us so you see uh when God when God has
[45:26] chosen
[45:28] somebody he does not just choose
[45:32] someone because of how they
[45:35] look he doesn't choose someone because
[45:38] of what they have
[45:40] done let me say that again God doesn't
[45:43] choose you because of how you look or
[45:47] because of what you have done or because
[45:50] of what you have not
[45:51] done if you understand that say
[45:54] amen God does not choose you after he SE
[45:59] you as human beings when a man is
[46:02] looking for a
[46:04] wife 99% of them want to see the beauty
[46:07] the outside the
[46:10] [Music]
[46:12] packaging I want to see how do their
[46:14] eyes look
[46:15] like how is their skin
[46:18] color how is their
[46:21] figure how is their hair and these are
[46:24] the things you know younger men always
[46:26] want to look at
[46:28] but God is not like
[46:30] man God is God God God even looked and
[46:35] oh my God he chose you before he looked
[46:37] at you your
[46:39] physical amen God chose you before you
[46:43] even came to
[46:45] be his choice of you was before the
[46:48] foundation of the
[46:50] [Music]
[46:51] world his choice of me was not here but
[46:55] was in him
[46:58] in Ephesians 1 ver4 he says according as
[47:01] he has chosen Us in
[47:06] him before the foundation of the
[47:10] world so God chose me in
[47:13] him before the foundation of the
[47:16] world that we now what did he choose me
[47:19] to
[47:20] be you know when when human beings
[47:23] choose human beings
[47:27] beings can fail
[47:28] them and that's why relationships
[47:32] fail many relationships
[47:35] fail and that's why when you are
[47:37] choosing a
[47:39] relationship you must choose it in
[47:42] Christ be in Christ and let the other
[47:45] person be in Christ and choose whatever
[47:48] you choose in
[47:50] Christ whatever you choose in Christ can
[47:52] never
[47:54] fail because it was in the mind of
[47:56] Christ before the foundation of the
[47:59] world okay let me put it in plain
[48:02] language if you choose a
[48:05] wife from the mind of Christ if God
[48:08] gives you a wife that marriage can never
[48:11] fail if you give yourself a
[48:14] wife or a husband that marriage can
[48:19] fail but if it is God who has given to
[48:23] you it cannot fail everything from God
[48:27] is
[48:28] permanent because God is
[48:30] eternal God is not a
[48:33] man is doesn't see things as a
[48:36] man God sees the end right at the
[48:41] beginning at the beginning is able to
[48:43] determine and see the
[48:47] end so that is why we believe in
[48:51] Prophecy prophecy is the revelation of
[48:53] the future
[48:57] God shows you what will
[48:59] be and this Bible is a book of
[49:02] Prophecy God declares what will
[49:05] be and whatever he said will be has to
[49:09] be so you see now when God chose
[49:13] you okay I don't know whether you
[49:15] believe it when God chose
[49:17] me before the foundation of the world he
[49:21] chose me in
[49:23] him so what did he choose me to become
[49:27] she chose me that I may be
[49:30] holy and Without
[49:35] Blame he chose me to be holy and to be
[49:40] blameless before him so in other words
[49:44] when God chose
[49:46] me he saw me before he chose
[49:49] me he saw he saw me in
[49:52] him and then he chose me in
[49:55] him what did he see he saw a holy
[50:00] person what did he see he saw a
[50:03] blameless
[50:05] person amen having predestinated an unto
[50:09] the adoption of children by Jesus
[50:15] Christ to
[50:18] himself according to the good pleasure
[50:21] of his
[50:24] will just open your mind now as as we we
[50:27] continue
[50:28] here it's a very interesting
[50:31] thought he CHS Us in
[50:34] him before the foundation of the
[50:38] world I want you to think about it
[50:41] before your father Met Your
[50:44] Mother God chose
[50:46] you before you were
[50:48] born God chose
[50:50] you before you did any good or any
[50:54] bad God chose you
[50:57] do you see how deeper it
[50:59] gets so he did not Choose You on the
[51:03] basis of your good
[51:06] works and he cannot reject you on the
[51:10] basis of your bad
[51:11] works because that was not the basis of
[51:14] his choice
[51:18] amen the basis of his
[51:21] choice was his forign knowledge
[51:26] what did he know he knew you would be
[51:30] holy he knew you would be blameless he
[51:33] knew you would be perfect and what God
[51:37] knew cannot
[51:39] fail because he saw it before it was
[51:43] brought into
[51:44] manifestation but what you and people
[51:48] see is your good
[51:51] works or your bad works but with God
[51:56] much
[51:58] Beyond he sees beyond
[52:02] that amen and that is why the scripture
[52:05] say who shall lay
[52:09] anything to the charge of God
[52:14] is
[52:16] anything who shall
[52:19] chge anything to the
[52:22] Church of God is who
[52:25] elect because I am an
[52:28] elect I am
[52:30] blameless because I am an I am Holy I am
[52:34] who I am not because of what I am I've
[52:37] done or what I've failed to do I am who
[52:41] I am because of what God Said I
[52:45] am amen and that's why Believers love
[52:48] the
[52:49] word because the word is a revelation of
[52:52] who we
[52:53] are amen the more of the word you
[52:57] the more confirmation happens you
[53:01] conform yourself to the word you renew
[53:05] your mind to the word let this mind be
[53:10] in you which was also in Christ
[53:13] Jesus you see the same mind why because
[53:17] the word amen reminds
[53:20] you of who truly you
[53:23] are you see he said here to be holy he
[53:29] he he chose us in
[53:31] him in him before the foundation of the
[53:36] world to be
[53:38] what holy are you following now to be
[53:43] holy and Without
[53:49] Blame I want us to understand that
[53:51] phrase there also power
[53:54] back to be he shows us in him to be
[53:58] holy and Without
[54:02] Blame before
[54:04] him in
[54:07] love now why did he do it in
[54:12] love because it's only love that could
[54:14] do
[54:16] it if it wasn't love we would be
[54:19] unworthy after we have come to
[54:23] manifestation because when we were
[54:25] manifested into the world
[54:28] we were manifested into a body of
[54:30] sin the Bible says we were born in
[54:33] sin shed in iniquity we came to the
[54:37] world speaking
[54:38] lives a child very little child we start
[54:42] telling
[54:44] lies the moment she or he begins to
[54:48] understand why because this is a body of
[54:52] Sin Sin born in sin born according to
[54:57] the lust of the
[54:59] flesh but what I'm saying s there is
[55:03] another
[55:04] you that is not this body another you
[55:10] that is not this flesh when I'm
[55:12] preaching to you right now your flesh is
[55:15] not hearing this
[55:17] word your flesh is actually
[55:20] Bor your flesh is actually
[55:23] tired your flesh doesn't want to
[55:28] your flesh doesn't even want to be
[55:30] here some of you L Dred it to
[55:34] come but when you begin hearing the word
[55:38] it activates something within
[55:40] you and you feel like life is
[55:43] building something is building on the
[55:45] inside you are becoming stronger and
[55:48] stronger and
[55:51] stronger until even your flesh becomes
[55:54] activated
[55:57] by the said even to the extent
[55:59] sometimes that even your flesh can't
[56:02] help it but to speak in
[56:06] tongues why because your flesh has
[56:09] entered into another
[56:12] room what I'm preaching to
[56:15] tonight I'm preaching to that inner
[56:18] man I'm preaching to that Soul I'm
[56:21] preaching to he amen that was in God
[56:26] before the foundation of the world he
[56:29] that God
[56:30] chose in him before the foundation of
[56:32] the world and how did he choose him he
[56:36] chose you in
[56:38] love tell your neighbor he chose you in
[56:42] love praise the name of the
[56:45] Lord in the Book of Proverbs
[56:49] 10:12 hatred sth up stripes
[56:57] but
[56:59] love all
[57:03] SE hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what
[57:07] people call
[57:09] love is not
[57:11] love many times what people call love is
[57:13] actually
[57:15] L if a young man can tell a young lady
[57:18] that I love
[57:20] you after they use them they dump
[57:23] them after they make them pregnant they
[57:25] Dison
[57:26] and the
[57:28] babies it was that
[57:30] love that was
[57:32] last it was not love so there is
[57:36] lust there is
[57:39] prostitution all the kind of
[57:41] Filth but it is always called love
[57:45] mistakenly that's not love and a person
[57:49] will tell you I love you someone can
[57:51] even kneel down someone can even
[57:54] literally cry
[57:56] the way they mean it because it is
[57:59] real according to the
[58:02] flesh it is human
[58:04] love but human love has an expir
[58:10] period you know Peter had it and that's
[58:13] the love he told he told
[58:15] Jesus even all the others forsake you I
[58:19] will never for second I will be where
[58:22] you are when they kill you I'll be there
[58:25] when they beat you I'll be there when I
[58:27] arrest you I'll be there and the moment
[58:29] they just started beating
[58:31] Jesus and a little child came to to
[58:34] Peter he said you one of them Peter
[58:37] changed his mind he said little what are
[58:40] you talking about I've never seen the
[58:42] man don't know the man at all three
[58:45] times the man rejected Jesus did he
[58:49] truly love Jesus was he meaning those
[58:51] words sure he was meaning them humanly
[58:55] speaking
[58:58] and that
[58:59] fails but there is a love I'm speaking
[59:01] about here that cannot
[59:05] fail that is God the Bible says God is
[59:10] love that is what it call
[59:13] Charity and he says charity never
[59:17] fail he he says Love cover all
[59:21] sins that's the love I'm speaking about
[59:24] the love he says
[59:26] you know it's not puffed up does not
[59:29] seek her
[59:31] own is not
[59:33] self-centered you know in First Peter 4
[59:35] he says and above all things have fent
[59:40] charity among yourselves for charity
[59:43] shall cover the multitude of
[59:47] sins there is only one thing that cannot
[59:50] fail and that is
[59:53] love but not human love now
[59:58] AG that is God's own
[1:00:01] life that's why you cannot truly
[1:00:04] genuinely love an
[1:00:08] unbeliever unbeliever can genuinely love
[1:00:12] you with which with what will he love
[1:00:15] you
[1:00:16] with he does not have the love of
[1:00:19] God are you following me okay now you
[1:00:22] say well you know when you when when you
[1:00:24] see in the scriptures
[1:00:27] God said Jacob have I
[1:00:30] loved but have I hated come to think of
[1:00:34] it Isaac their
[1:00:37] father loved Who Loved
[1:00:41] is Jacob so he was a man he was a human
[1:00:46] and the Bible says he loved
[1:00:49] is but with what kind of
[1:00:53] love not
[1:00:56] because God loved
[1:00:58] Jacob not es so there is no way Isaac
[1:01:02] could love Esau with the love of
[1:01:06] God there is only one kind of love of
[1:01:10] God and that is the one which does not
[1:01:13] fail but as this man said he loved
[1:01:17] Esau he ended up giving the blessing to
[1:01:22] Jacob so was that genuine love you say
[1:01:25] he was was deceived J When Love cannot
[1:01:28] be deceived J When Love is
[1:01:31] perfect and so when you know see how now
[1:01:35] oh my the Bible is just so
[1:01:37] sweet oh my when when you get into it
[1:01:39] you just enjoy it so I want you to see
[1:01:41] verse four he says according as he has
[1:01:43] chosen Us in
[1:01:46] him before the foundation of the
[1:01:48] world that we should be holy and Without
[1:01:53] Blame before him
[1:01:56] in
[1:01:57] love did you get that so it has it has
[1:02:01] to be by love or in
[1:02:03] love it could not be possible for us to
[1:02:06] be holy and blameless without
[1:02:10] love why because love covers a multitude
[1:02:14] of
[1:02:16] sins God's love never
[1:02:19] fails where there are Tong they shall
[1:02:22] fail where there are gifts it shall
[1:02:24] cease where there is all the things it
[1:02:26] shall stop but love never
[1:02:30] fails he chose us to be holy he CH us to
[1:02:35] to have to have no
[1:02:37] blame amen not our
[1:02:39] Holiness but his Holiness you know our
[1:02:43] Holiness is as few through Rags as the
[1:02:44] Bible
[1:02:45] says so in other words friends he has
[1:02:49] made
[1:02:51] us you know what love
[1:02:54] does love picks the
[1:02:57] filth and makes something beautiful out
[1:03:03] of Hallelujah am so what love
[1:03:07] does no human can
[1:03:10] do because God loved
[1:03:13] you for God so loved the world that he
[1:03:16] even gave His only
[1:03:20] begotten God gave his
[1:03:24] treasure in the we know that when we say
[1:03:28] begotten son we're talking about God
[1:03:30] himself powering himself in a man on
[1:03:39] Earth God Amen Jesus was a gift powered
[1:03:44] out God powered himself
[1:03:47] out when the devil thought he had
[1:03:50] finished the human
[1:03:52] Rest by corrupting it through
[1:03:56] and Adam he did not know God still had
[1:04:01] love amen and while he had thought he
[1:04:04] had destroyed
[1:04:05] everything amen God was just
[1:04:08] beginning and the only thing that God
[1:04:10] could use was love God himself came amen
[1:04:17] maybe all the Angels wanted to come and
[1:04:20] save the
[1:04:21] situation maybe W tried Michel tried
[1:04:25] Gabel tried but he told them no with
[1:04:29] this it has to be
[1:04:31] love only love can do this and the Bible
[1:04:35] says God is love God himself had to come
[1:04:40] and leave his glory down from
[1:04:43] Glory he he came down from glory and he
[1:04:47] condescended
[1:04:49] down to the
[1:04:52] lowest he was God but yet he made
[1:04:55] himself as a man to the extent he was
[1:04:59] killed on the
[1:05:00] cross what was that it was
[1:05:05] love he made us we've not made
[1:05:09] ourselves there is something I want us
[1:05:11] to get to tonight I want you to
[1:05:14] understand when we talking about being
[1:05:16] blameless and being
[1:05:20] holy it's not you that
[1:05:23] struggles to say oh my God
[1:05:26] like like brother said one time people
[1:05:27] say oh i s God I S God I S
[1:05:34] God he said you don't seek
[1:05:37] God it is God who seeks and after
[1:05:41] you when Abraham when Adam sinned and
[1:05:45] Eve they just ran away they didn't seek
[1:05:47] after God but what did God do love
[1:05:50] brought him down
[1:05:53] said I don't know what I have been
[1:05:57] without his love amen it is him who
[1:05:59] seeks after me it is him who looks after
[1:06:03] me it is him who has made me what I am
[1:06:06] it is him who is changing me every day
[1:06:08] it is
[1:06:11] love he has made
[1:06:14] us in Revelation of Jesus Christ it says
[1:06:18] he has made us oh there is a certain
[1:06:21] truth that we need to
[1:06:23] emphasize this is one of them
[1:06:27] he
[1:06:28] he he has made
[1:06:32] us just say he has made
[1:06:35] me it will make sense to you if you say
[1:06:38] it just say it he has made
[1:06:42] me salvation is his
[1:06:46] doing salvation is is of the
[1:06:49] Lord you remember when those three
[1:06:51] Hebrew
[1:06:53] children when they were cast down into
[1:06:55] the fire
[1:06:56] you know I believe all the Angels
[1:06:58] brother would say wanted to come and
