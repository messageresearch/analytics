[11:05] i was wrong
[11:07] that was not rahab
[11:10] it was uh
[11:11] rude yeah
[11:17] you know sometimes when preachers when
[11:19] we are preaching
[11:20] some sometimes you can give a wrong
[11:22] quote and
[11:24] speak a wrong name and place things
[11:26] wrongly but i believe each person who is
[11:29] spiritual they are able to read between
[11:31] the lines
[11:43] [Music]
[11:53] so
[11:54] it is
[11:55] the person who wrote this thank you for
[11:57] your correction
[12:00] um
[12:02] actually it was ruth
[12:05] that
[12:06] um
[12:15] if you go to the book of ruth
[12:17] mitchell
[12:21] you'll notice in chapter four 4
[12:25] verse 21
[12:34] [Music]
[12:50] they
[13:04] a
[13:06] okay so
[13:10] now i have a question here the nature
[13:13] i know
[13:15] he says can i pay my time
[13:33] to the person that uh asked this
[13:35] question
[13:38] but i want to say no you cannot
[13:42] know
[13:44] we as believers should help the needy
[13:46] finger
[14:00] to the book of malacca if you can go
[14:02] quit there quickly malachi singha
[14:04] together
[14:06] i'll give more details in the little
[14:08] videos i told you that i would be able
[14:09] to
[14:10] know
[14:11] that but never cause the overtime
[14:13] viewers
[14:15] but if you go to malachi chapter 3
[14:21] are you there
[14:24] malacca is the last book in the old
[14:25] testament
[14:36] [Music]
[14:42] yet
[14:56] cast with a cast for ye have robbed me
[14:59] even this whole nation
[15:05] so then here on verstappen it tells you
[15:08] what you should do and how you should do
[15:10] it
[15:24] me now
[15:26] here we said the lord of hosts for if i
[15:29] will not open your you the windows of
[15:31] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[15:33] there shall not be room enough to
[15:34] receive it
[15:38] even
[15:53] where are you supposed to bring it when
[15:54] i build a tower where
[15:57] why
[15:58] store house
[16:00] what is kept in the storehouse
[16:04] food
[16:05] not so similar
[16:22] so the word is
[16:24] the one that you receive from goddess
[16:27] storehouse
[16:30] whenever you come to church and you hear
[16:32] the word
[17:01] and if you have another question out of
[17:02] this uh what i will say you again send
[17:05] it to me i will still address it on the
[17:07] video
[17:11] i'm going to try and be
[17:13] um one hour and a half or so and
[17:16] therefore
[17:45] every christian buddhism christian and
[17:47] tight is 10 percent of our income
[17:54] 10 of our salary
[17:59] because not all people receive salaries
[18:03] you know but everyone receives income
[18:08] you see when you receive income maybe
[18:09] someone has given you a gift
[18:31] [Music]
[18:36] i spoke i think about a few weeks ago i
[18:39] spoke on taithes and offerings
[18:45] that has asked this please go and listen
[18:48] to that
[18:51] now your tithe you pay your tithers to
[18:54] your church your pastor
[19:07] that did not
[19:08] get any inheritance
[19:13] god said don't do not worry you you are
[19:16] mine
[19:19] and so you see your tribe the tribe of
[19:21] levi you your mind
[19:50] receive
[20:21] to the levites
[20:22] and to the people
[20:24] of the delivered should stand in for the
[20:26] lord
[20:32] universe
[20:42] so when you for instance
[20:44] if you pay your trip to me
[21:15] that type money cutting entirely
[21:17] and i use it the wrong way
[21:20] that's none of your business
[21:22] i'll have to answer for that
[21:25] because remember that ministers
[21:27] pastors
[21:28] must
[21:56] how
[21:59] but there is no obligation for any
[22:01] person to account to you how he used
[22:03] type
[22:08] and that's why some of these mega church
[22:11] pastors have
[22:12] decided to
[22:14] abuse it
[22:23] but i think that gives you a a picture
[22:27] they know they should question
[22:28] and i'll be able if you want the details
[22:31] on this subject please go and listen to
[22:33] the summon i preached on tithies and
[22:35] offerings it's on youtube and also on
[22:36] the podcast
[22:38] every single
[22:47] someone is preaching on the road and
[22:49] you're like oh you're preaching so well
[22:51] and then you take your time no
[23:15] and
[23:21] i wish i could go in detail and read you
[23:23] a few questions
[23:29] but
[23:30] uh if you are if what you should ask
[23:33] them if it's okay for them now
[23:35] singing but didn't take it
[23:42] so that's why it's good for you to write
[23:43] your name whatever you do
[23:47] but still i'll give more detail later
[23:52] okay now i have another question here
[23:54] from brother sam
[23:55] that's somewhere
[23:57] we have several songs i don't know but
[23:58] not over some of them you can see
[24:01] how can a person control his or her
[24:03] feelings maybe
[24:05] when tempted or
[24:07] maybe not
[24:11] yet
[24:16] i think that they're meaning
[24:18] and i i'm requesting you people to
[24:19] switch up your phones if you can't
[24:20] please
[24:23] it says how can a person control i think
[24:25] they mean if how can a person control
[24:28] his or her feelings
[24:32] when tempted or not
[24:34] yeah
[24:43] obama
[24:53] [Music]
[25:14] you cannot have cell phones
[25:20] i'll ask you a question
[25:22] many times
[25:24] you can do
[25:25] something
[25:39] don't look at me as if you
[25:47] [Music]
[26:08] self-control
[26:10] but you see in your control tower
[26:18] all the students of god have a control
[26:20] tower
[26:27] [Music]
[26:37] therefore
[26:38] satan is controlling you
[26:40] if it's god
[26:42] is controlling
[26:44] now what is in your soul
[26:45] remember all of us for now we are born
[26:49] with a mad soul
[26:56] we are born in a perverted way
[26:59] whether we are children of god or not
[27:02] meaning whether we are serpent seed or
[27:04] the seed of god
[27:31] how many news
[28:56] so in other words serpent city cannot
[28:58] accept the world exactly
[29:03] because there is nothing in them there
[29:05] is no seed jumped you could get
[29:06] converted
[29:10] to the
[29:22] lies
[29:32] there are three stages of you of grace
[29:34] that god will take you through the way
[29:52] so it brings you out of the world
[29:54] and we baptize you in his name
[29:57] but you still have the desires which i
[30:00] know what you used to have
[30:03] yet you are in charge
[30:06] that's why when you get baptized and
[30:07] then you disappear from fellowship
[30:12] baptism
[30:16] you have to remain there
[30:18] and go through more process no you're
[30:35] [Music]
[30:48] i'll make
[31:30] it's just like the desire
[31:50] [Music]
[31:58] child they have repented of it
[32:05] there is still something else
[32:06] controlling
[32:10] and let me tell you
[32:11] that desire may remain there
[32:16] for the rest of your life
[32:18] now but the only thing that changes you
[32:20] mentioned
[32:22] is what is on your control tower
[32:26] as
[33:22] the moment you receive the holy ghost
[33:26] he begins controlling your desires
[33:42] so we continue living between desires
[34:10] [Music]
[34:18] child
[34:34] hallelujah amen
[34:36] from that moment
[34:37] you are never the same again
[34:40] will you be tempted
[34:42] oh yes
[34:44] but you can control
[34:47] you
[35:06] [Music]
[35:07] [Applause]
[35:15] from that moment
[35:17] hallelujah he's on the control tower
[35:20] he's the one guiding you and leading you
[35:23] yeah
[35:25] when you are tempted
[35:26] never he's your strength
[35:28] and he gives you victory in every
[35:30] temptation
[35:33] hallelujah man the answer to this
[35:36] the only way you can control receive the
[35:38] holy ghost
[35:58] said how have you been
[36:01] um how how are you i'm gambled yeah i've
[36:04] been fine
[36:06] since i got saved
[36:08] and i was filled with the holocaust not
[36:10] jesus
[36:38] it
[36:39] black
[37:04] your connection with them is based on
[37:06] the things
[37:19] it will just put you down flat each time
[37:24] anyway but if you are incredible
[37:27] you are a new creation
[37:30] the odd life passes away
[37:33] and you receive another another another
[37:36] being to control you in your life
[37:42] is it
[37:43] those drugs in a case it's for a good
[37:48] tv
[38:01] okay
[38:26] please the question is
[38:28] drugs is it bad to use drugs
[38:30] chibi
[38:45] what the brother asks
[38:46] for
[38:50] hallelujah i mean so now anything drugs
[38:56] we have a doctor here a medical doctor
[38:58] wanna truly know mr
[39:12] it is not
[39:17] many of the drugs we use in the hospital
[39:22] you know actually most of them
[39:24] are gonna really come from houses
[40:08] god made with catholic
[40:11] but what happens to people
[40:15] the devil
[40:18] i'm answering a question here
[40:23] no i hope
[40:24] you people are not misunderstanding this
[40:26] they will be
[40:28] follow me closely
[40:31] but it is the devil satani that perverts
[40:34] what god has created
[40:49] foreign
[40:56] young people you are very quiet
[41:19] someone would do it
[41:22] and
[41:23] they would call it prostitution never
[41:25] cheated
[41:27] fornication
[41:30] someone else would do it
[41:32] and it would
[41:55] [Music]
[42:01] me is it bad to use drugs
[42:05] in case it's for a good reason
[42:10] if
[42:12] the first question i'll ask is what type
[42:14] of drug
[42:15] video that are gonna charge if it's
[42:17] medical drugs
[42:18] but if it's for medical reasons
[42:23] then i don't even think it's a question
[42:24] because it's prescribed by a doctor and
[42:26] it's going to be in limits
[42:57] with you and someone has convinced you
[42:58] that you see this hub
[43:01] to be known when you take it you will
[43:03] you will become intelligent
[43:07] is that a good reason
[43:10] surely lana is it a good reason song and
[43:13] truth
[43:15] no please answer me be honest with
[43:17] yourself
[43:19] if someone tells you
[43:21] taking wit
[43:23] will make you wise
[43:28] don't go deep into the thing just
[43:30] understand my questions
[43:36] is it a good reason
[43:40] yes
[43:41] it's a good reason
[43:43] so the person asked
[43:45] is it but use drugs
[43:46] it's for good reason
[43:50] so if i say yes
[43:52] it's not wrong
[43:54] then they will go and take it
[43:56] because someone has told them
[43:59] it's actually going to make you white
[44:01] yeah okay
[44:03] and he will take the weed
[44:06] to
[44:21] it is wrong
[44:22] for a christian to go the scripture says
[44:25] that we should not um
[44:27] we should not fashion ourselves after
[44:29] the world
[44:31] champion
[44:34] if
[44:48] i don't believe
[45:00] that is not right
[45:02] because it's going to end up in
[45:06] um
[45:07] um in getting addicted to the drugs
[45:13] you're going to come here at church
[45:17] high foreign your good worry and
[45:19] sometimes you're going to be really low
[45:21] or more very well you don't take it
[45:24] you take it again
[45:26] you become really hard our guru that's
[45:28] getting addicted
[45:45] was taking work
[45:50] that you i don't know it's mixed with
[45:52] his blood or something yeah two kids say
[45:54] that
[45:55] he got the name
[45:57] so the doctor told him
[46:23] something that is not really good for
[46:25] you as a christian a christian must have
[46:27] a spiritual thinking filter um
[46:38] there is a medicine called
[46:40] what would they reach
[46:49] i'm not sure i'm not a medical person
[46:51] but i think it has a lot of weird need
[46:52] or something some of us
[47:00] [Music]
[47:09] no comments
[47:10] it shows that you are not believing that
[47:12] god can heal you
[47:14] why don't you take something with such a
[47:16] side effect and then you're like oh no
[47:18] it's okay as long as the doctor's
[47:19] prescribed
[47:22] a baby
[47:32] the concept is
[47:34] nothing that god has made is bad
[47:52] that's why
[47:53] we should we should um
[47:55] you know flee from
[47:57] parents of evil
[48:03] embedded
[48:33] [Music]
[48:45] [Music]
[48:56] so i believe
[48:59] it's
[49:00] not right for believers to take drugs
[49:08] if i was the one and i was prescribed to
[49:10] take weed
[49:42] i don't know how many will do that
[49:46] i believe our god is not
[49:49] so little
[49:51] that he would have to stoop so low
[49:54] on
[50:02] [Music]
[50:09] so brother i believe when you say drugs
[50:11] i meant believe you said the weed
[50:12] because what we they talked about
[50:20] avoid those things
[50:51] what can i do
[50:52] when in school
[50:55] and people are praying the rosary while
[50:58] kneeling
[50:59] am i supposed to kneel like them um
[51:19] to be politically correct
[51:34] but you cannot bow before idols
[51:38] if they let them kneel other people
[51:42] why do you even stay there where they
[51:44] are
[51:46] move away
[51:47] if you cannot move forward
[52:13] [Music]
[52:21] [Music]
[52:30] who have families
[52:35] [Music]
[52:44] is
[52:53] [Music]
[52:58] so if they invite me peter they make
[53:01] sure there is no alcohol on them
[53:05] if there is alcohol
[53:07] they will never even dare to invite each
[53:09] other
[53:10] because they know i will not go come on
[53:26] they thought i was joking
[53:28] as time went by
[53:31] i realized i don't care never
[53:33] get on this fire if anything stands
[53:35] between me and god chindi shall never
[53:37] see me that walker
[53:39] i take god as my prayer
[53:42] so he's number one in my life
[53:45] everything else
[53:47] is so that's what you have to do
[53:52] in your society
[53:53] everywhere you are
[54:02] [Music]
[54:17] i have a lot of because i want to read
[54:19] for each question but
[54:21] i'm just going to go through as much as
[54:22] i can and and then
[54:24] i will go through each of them with them
[54:32] as i promised you i will make those
[54:33] videos
[54:35] god bless you church this one is
[54:40] [Music]
[54:43] i don't understand the question why
[54:47] it's people
[54:48] oh this this one needed to have some
[54:50] more grammar
[54:53] why it's people company about the
[54:56] believers
[54:58] to stay with unbelievers
[55:02] they understand the question
[55:06] why
[55:07] people
[55:10] why is it people company
[55:16] about the believers
[55:20] why is it that people complain about the
[55:22] believers is that the question
[55:26] is okay
[55:28] so and then
[55:31] what what we is there a problem with
[55:33] them
[55:34] says
[55:36] it's easy to stay with unbelievers
[55:59] why did the
[56:00] world act
[56:03] reject what did the world
[56:04] believe us
[56:07] is it good when you marry
[56:11] an unbeliever
[56:14] before getting
[56:15] this message of the hour
[56:21] if i don't understand them
[56:25] um
[56:26] stay with unbelievers why did the world
[56:28] reject okay now maybe you are asking why
[56:33] the
[56:34] what does the word reject believers
[56:36] russians
[56:38] it is simple christ was rejected so they
[56:40] will reject us
[56:44] thing about the world and see you engage
[56:47] if
[56:48] you do what they want
[56:52] you are their friends
[56:54] if you don't
[56:56] you are there
[57:02] you see you cannot if everybody is going
[57:05] to
[57:06] academy for example if everybody is
[57:08] going for a disco
[57:10] i met another
[57:24] do you think you are going to dress
[57:27] as you dress when you are coming to
[57:28] church and go with them
[57:33] again
[57:34] even when you do neighbors
[57:37] they will not be happy with you
[57:48] you would have to dress like them oh you
[57:50] know
[57:52] you would have to dress a trouser oh
[57:54] yeah malefice or a minuscule mini
[57:57] if you're a young man
[57:59] you would have to do the haircut or you
[58:00] know
[58:02] you would have to um
[58:04] you know these days even younger men are
[58:06] using makeup
[58:11] they are putting pins in their ears but
[58:12] they can't help you
[58:14] what the world is standing there
[58:18] and and you see you would have to do the
[58:20] work do
[58:47] rejects
[58:48] the devils and the demons in the world
[58:52] and the demons in the world that is
[58:54] imaginable fear the god in us
[58:58] and that's the reason why
[59:00] it's very hard for a true believer to
[59:02] accompany himself with an unbeliever
[59:12] but if you find
[59:13] yourself with them all the time neither
[59:16] way
[59:30] hallelujah how can if you are not a
[59:33] cockroach well that will change how can
[59:35] you accompany with cockroaches oh you
[59:38] don't you better navy age is it possible
[59:42] to love darkness
[1:00:11] surely loves you so much
[1:00:29] and then is it good
[1:00:31] when you marry an unbeliever before
[1:00:34] getting the message of the hour
[1:00:36] chirunji
[1:00:40] [Music]
[1:00:46] [Music]
[1:01:06] as a matter of fact even if they have
[1:01:07] two waves
[1:01:22] amen doesn't want to matter true
[1:01:30] for example
[1:01:32] [Music]
[1:01:36] if i
[1:01:50] [Music]
[1:02:33] for instance if a girl believes the
[1:02:35] message um what about kirizov and she
[1:02:38] hears what i preached today
[1:02:40] in the morning
[1:02:42] that she has to be a virtuous woman
[1:02:46] to repent my husband before marriage
[1:02:48] is for not to be no queen and yes
[1:02:51] and oh what can i do now i got nothing
[1:02:54] yeah i was i did not know that notice i
[1:02:57] leave you without knowing now because
[1:02:59] but now i've believed that the indicator
[1:03:00] is there
[1:03:16] and then you don't go again ahead with
[1:03:18] that kind of like because
[1:03:21] you see and when you are married
[1:03:23] you don't say i will not tell my husband
[1:03:25] before i marry because it was before i
[1:03:27] believed
[1:03:28] [Music]
[1:03:39] if someone was
[1:03:40] you know moving around in the world and
[1:03:41] they get hiv oh my
[1:04:05] when someone has several wives and
[1:04:06] believes that car will remain with them
[1:04:08] they will remain with the wives but it's
[1:04:10] a scar in their lives
[1:04:17] and they can't be beacons
[1:04:20] they can't be passed
[1:04:24] why right because
[1:04:27] of that scar in their lives
[1:04:31] says
[1:04:32] the word of god says that a deacon is
[1:04:36] a pastor no more must be a husband of
[1:04:38] one arena
[1:04:42] so this one has some scars
[1:04:47] some wipes he had
[1:04:50] and so it's not good
[1:04:52] in that in that context
[1:05:00] and you had a girlfriend
[1:05:04] you repent of that
[1:05:06] and
[1:05:07] [Music]
[1:05:28] [Laughter]
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:06:01] maybe after a
[1:06:02] while god has desired for her to be a
[1:06:05] believer
[1:06:08] if god has desired for her to be your
[1:06:09] future wife
[1:06:14] that's really in the hands of the lord
[1:06:18] amen
[1:06:22] oh my so
[1:06:23] i'm watching the time
[1:06:25] i want to stop at six and it's number

[1:06:39] that
[1:06:40] again

[1:06:48] okay so
[1:06:51] under what circumstances can i believe
[1:06:53] or marry an unbeliever
[1:07:12] you see
[1:07:13] the prophet says
[1:07:15] brother you have to give me more sound
[1:07:20] okay he says that uh
[1:07:24] no circumstance
[1:07:38] oh
[1:07:42] me say again
[1:07:43] some people are not being attentive
[1:07:48] will you please listen to me
[1:07:50] the prophet said
[1:07:53] under no circumstances
[1:07:57] [Music]

[1:09:12] this is a good one
[1:09:14] the book of corinthians
[1:09:16] chapter 6 verse 14.

[1:09:51] unbelievers

[1:09:58] to unequal powers oh good
[1:10:07] [Music]
[1:10:17] [Music]
[1:10:28] so they cannot be equal
[1:10:32] they should never agree
[1:10:35] they can never dig
[1:10:38] and your form will not be allowed
[1:10:42] why
[1:11:38] it
[1:11:41] that is that is not healthy
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:44] lunch
[1:11:45] i would rather work
[1:11:47] you preach to them
[1:11:49] let god convert them again
[1:11:52] and then
[1:12:11] [Music]
[1:12:18] in many circumstances
[1:12:20] they do not have an idea to marry them
[1:12:22] when they are preaching to them
[1:12:37] [Music]
[1:12:47] those young people
[1:13:16] a bunch of trips i didn't know good
[1:13:18] times
[1:13:19] and then uh and then uh and then when
[1:13:22] when she uh when he went category after
[1:13:26] one month my daughter was coming he had
[1:13:27] read it
[1:13:29] he realized it was the truth
[1:13:59] unity
[1:14:02] and this brother organ is now a preacher
[1:14:05] of the message
[1:14:08] and is married to this sister
[1:14:10] yeah
[1:14:13] [Music]
[1:14:45] from the bible what punishment has god
[1:14:47] ever given to a church or a pastor or a
[1:14:50] prophet
[1:14:51] who misuses or mismanages the tithe and
[1:14:55] offerings of the church musumba go to
[1:14:57] what everywhere where are you
[1:15:00] go to what dave you could have come to
[1:15:02] me
[1:15:04] which which punishment
[1:15:08] has god ever given to a church catholic
[1:15:11] area
[1:15:12] or a pastor obama
[1:15:14] or a prophet
[1:15:15] who misuses all mismanagers the price
[1:15:17] and offerings of the church
[1:15:21] i believe my brother and i have your
[1:15:23] name here but i'll not mention it i
[1:15:24] don't know where you are
[1:15:26] and you really have guts to put your
[1:15:27] name on on such questions
[1:15:34] you see
[1:15:35] i believe you've got to ask that because
[1:15:37] you found that we are mismanaging funds
[1:15:39] here
[1:15:49] with your center
[1:16:04] in the bible my baby why do you uh
[1:16:07] servants of god who mismanage the fact
[1:16:14] and the most notable ones or the ones
[1:16:16] that are known
[1:16:17] so much is the family of ellie
[1:16:20] when you're game
[1:16:22] eddie was a faithful man
[1:16:25] what is children
[1:16:26] we are not faithful
[1:16:29] don't take the offerings
[1:16:32] it's
[1:16:44] for themselves
[1:17:50] and we shall give accountability
[1:17:53] now those of you in my family know me
[1:17:55] very well
[1:18:11] to learn and appreciate it
[1:18:15] you must learn ordinary accountability
[1:18:18] because even in heaven name of god we
[1:18:20] are going to give accountability
[1:18:23] i give you this body now questions
[1:18:25] this body now who are mobility going to
[1:18:27] give accountability
[1:18:28] how did you use it
[1:18:32] [Music]
[1:18:36] but here father you know
[1:18:45] [Music]
[1:19:04] some of these questions i'll spend some
[1:19:06] good time on them and give more
[1:19:07] prescriptions
[1:19:11] brother used to say the statement read
[1:19:13] between the lines
[1:19:19] what does it mean
[1:19:21] now
[1:19:22] that means that not everything he says
[1:19:24] is the way he says it to the gaza and
[1:19:26] the scent of your navigable
[1:19:30] but the spiritual understands
[1:19:33] together praise
[1:19:48] without mentioning the act that was done
[1:19:52] but then again you have to read between
[1:19:53] the lines now you got to go you're not
[1:19:55] taking it out you know no you understand
[1:19:57] what exactly i'm trying to count
[1:20:02] many times i've been preaching and i
[1:20:03] said
[1:20:07] the scripture says
[1:20:10] soul is the way of an adulteress woman
[1:20:31] how many have read between the lines
[1:20:36] so according to you what did she do
[1:20:41] did you read between the lines
[1:20:44] and what did
[1:20:56] yes
[1:21:20] [Music]
[1:22:06] hallelujah i mean and so then you get
[1:22:09] into the details of that
[1:22:12] that's what it means to read between the
[1:22:13] lines
[1:22:20] sometimes if you visit somebody reading
[1:22:22] between the lines teacher name
[1:22:25] all right brother you're married

[1:22:53] wife

[1:24:31] how many know what that means
[1:24:34] this job
[1:24:35] is how many can explain who can explain
[1:24:37] that
[1:24:41] yes
[1:24:52] yes
[1:24:53] so
[1:24:54] you've been in a situation
[1:25:25] homeopathy is our mind oh you've got
[1:25:27] faith in those of your faith and
[1:25:30] some people dream after stones
[1:25:36] subconscious and the consciousness
[1:25:48] their subconscious is very close to
[1:25:50] their sub uh their subconscious
[1:26:06] you can be there talking about
[1:26:08] and then in a moment
[1:26:11] she explains you what you are saying
[1:26:14] and she will take like five minutes to
[1:26:16] explain that
[1:26:17] another thing will come to pass exactly
[1:26:34] oh
[1:26:58] a vision is the same thing that happens
[1:27:00] when you are dreaming
[1:27:34] you know they just see themselves in
[1:27:37] church
[1:27:38] worshiping never seen them others they
[1:27:40] see things which come to pass
[1:27:43] others you know many different things i
[1:27:45] mean
[1:27:46] what do we see in our subconscious
[1:27:48] finger drivers and others don't really
[1:27:50] dream about it
[1:27:52] but it doesn't mean they don't have a
[1:27:53] subconscious
[1:27:54] mind
[1:27:57] it does we have each of us not to be the
[1:27:59] name between here is what i wanted to
[1:28:01] say
[1:28:02] there is something here that the bible
[1:28:04] says what are watching too and a bible
[1:28:06] i want to read it quickly for you
[1:28:10] in the book of uh
[1:28:12] 12 romans 12.
[1:28:18] and be not conformed to this world
[1:28:20] but be transformed by the renewing of
[1:28:22] your mind
[1:28:24] that you may prove what is that good an
[1:28:27] acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:29:21] to show you what i'm saying
[1:29:32] way back
[1:29:34] when you sleep
[1:29:36] you will begin to dream those things as
[1:29:37] if you are actually it is actually in
[1:29:39] real reality
[1:29:44] whatever happened to any of you what do
[1:29:45] i challenge to say
[1:29:49] you know you maybe someone is preaching
[1:29:52] you slept while hearing
[1:29:54] that and you you're hearing while
[1:29:56] sleeping
[1:29:57] so you see yourself in the church
[1:30:00] and maybe many other things will happen
[1:30:02] there may be a dream
[1:30:49] from the time i received the holy ghost
[1:30:52] i have never had even one nightmare sit
[1:30:55] down come here
[1:30:57] completely nothing
[1:31:00] and all the dreams
[1:31:56] mind
[1:31:58] if you if you die
[1:32:00] a fornicator
[1:32:03] something happened
[1:32:05] if you sleep but wherever a foreign
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:52] the moment you receive the holy ghost
[1:32:55] you hear the word of god
[1:33:05] and many people when they believe about
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:34] actually have been even just conscious
[1:33:37] happening in the spiritual world
[1:33:45] so you see even in your concierge
[1:33:54] [Music]
[1:34:03] and in an emergency of dreams then
[1:34:04] there's also a lot of um a lot of
[1:34:06] discrepancies
[1:34:11] because you've been thinking about
[1:34:12] something
[1:34:15] and this is really what happens most of
[1:34:16] the time
[1:34:18] but until someone's conscious is washed
[1:34:20] and cleansed by the word of god under
[1:34:22] their mind renewed
[1:34:28] then god takes control
[1:34:35] and then you he begins to show you
[1:34:36] things to come catch you i'm not going
[1:34:38] to go call a baby into every night yeah
[1:34:40] he says when he the holy ghost comes
[1:34:43] he will do what
[1:34:44] show
[1:34:56] these dreams are only showing you the
[1:34:58] status of your spiritual life now
[1:35:06] i can see
[1:35:07] you need to enter into a stage of
[1:35:09] sanctification
[1:35:25] how do you do that by praying
[1:35:40] my question is about marriage
[1:35:44] and you don't have a name oh okay
[1:35:48] as far as seeking god's kingdom and his
[1:35:50] righteousness
[1:35:52] first a concern
[1:35:53] is marriage also god is righteousness
[1:36:09] it depends on the context you're asking
[1:36:15] i believe before you get married
[1:36:19] you must have a relationship with god
[1:36:21] fast
[1:36:55] the marriage will not take away the
[1:36:56] banning
[1:37:00] there are many things that married
[1:37:01] people do what would have been to know
[1:37:03] india from baby back that
[1:37:18] god again
[1:37:21] so i believe before you get married
[1:37:26] first have christ as your headships
[1:37:32] remember you will also be the head of
[1:37:34] your wife
[1:37:37] can you now have to be ahead of somebody
[1:37:39] when you don't have a headache
[1:37:45] you don't come to church
[1:38:01] a a a a a a family
[1:38:04] and guide your wife
[1:38:07] be the pastor of your home
[1:38:10] remember as a pastor in the house
[1:38:14] as a husband no matter the pastor of
[1:38:16] your home
[1:38:18] how can you do that
[1:38:21] if you cannot receive a
[1:38:23] breakthrough in prayer now before you
[1:38:25] get married
[1:38:45] as a christian or message believer which
[1:38:48] is the correct way of marrying that god
[1:38:49] once
[1:39:01] i know that there are some people who
[1:39:03] say they are the ones who tell you who
[1:39:04] to marry man
[1:39:10] they must make
[1:39:52] oh
[1:40:06] mature
[1:40:08] and i've spoken on the part of the
[1:40:09] spirit so you must be my true spirit
[1:40:13] number two
[1:40:15] you must be ready
[1:40:19] and we found that to be a big problem
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:40:26] they think they're spiritually mature
[1:40:30] they think they uh they they are
[1:40:32] physically mature i don't want the
[1:40:33] normal video
[1:40:49] a place they call their own
[1:40:53] he doesn't even have a mattress signing
[1:40:56] so
[1:40:57] you should not you have no business
[1:40:58] talking to anybody's daughter why do you
[1:41:00] want to talk
[1:41:02] about whatever

[1:41:32] courtship
[1:41:45] yes no
[1:41:46] believers
[1:41:48] they do court they they do caught
[1:41:53] you know you you begin a conversation
[1:41:57] it's an intention to get married
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:43:21] remember while you were doing all that
[1:43:22] you were praying
[1:43:25] you do it by faith
[1:43:27] by the time you finish
[1:43:30] god will bring that to you
[1:43:32] and then when you get done
[1:43:35] you just continue with the prayers
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:44:03] um

[1:44:17] word i love you

[1:50:29] right because many of the times
[1:50:32] if a young man came to me
[1:50:36] the next
[1:50:45] you know i always find out when they
[1:50:47] come to me after speaking together out
[1:50:49] there usually doesn't end well
[1:50:52] [Music]
[1:51:18] this has happened on several occasions
[1:51:21] and he he spoke to me
[1:51:23] i'm interested in sisters
[1:51:27] and several times
[1:51:28] it was found
[1:51:30] his sister was already engaged
[1:51:32] even to get
[1:51:34] [Music]
[1:51:45] [Music]
[1:52:06] can you help me can you talk to her on
[1:52:08] my behalf
[1:52:11] you know someone asked me to talk to her
[1:52:29] to mamamoo go there wait again
[1:52:34] if they refuse you
[1:52:36] now
[1:52:38] just gather yourself up
[1:52:42] and wait for another opportunity
[1:52:46] but if they are the right ones for you
[1:52:48] they can never refuse it
[1:52:51] hallelujah
[1:52:53] praise the name of the lord
[1:52:55] and of course when you start talking
[1:52:57] then you go into courtship
[1:53:02] at some point the pastor gets to know
[1:53:03] what happens tomorrow
[1:53:06] then
[1:53:08] you announce your engagement
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:40] [Laughter]
[1:54:17] [Music]
[1:54:48] and that's all i can say
[1:54:51] can you forgive someone who tries to
[1:54:54] fail your life
[1:54:57] [Music]
[1:55:17] what should i do
[1:55:19] i have no job
[1:55:20] please be the one who wrote this yeah
[1:55:24] kindly make sure you come and see it
[1:55:28] because you need some concept
[1:55:35] [Music]
[1:55:45] surrounding this case i don't know what
[1:55:46] to say i don't know what you're going
[1:55:48] through cement choice my childhood
[1:55:51] please come and see me
[1:55:54] okay now there is another question here
[1:55:56] okay our time is up can i can i continue
[1:55:58] a little bit more
[1:56:07] [Music]
[1:56:25] all right so let us continue for 30
[1:56:27] minutes
[1:56:30] um
[1:56:32] this is another brother okay here's
[1:56:33] another question here
[1:56:36] the bible talks about our time for
[1:56:38] everything
[1:56:56] don't you think one needs to involve
[1:56:58] himself or herself in what she or he is
[1:57:01] supposed to do at the time
[1:57:05] don't you think
[1:57:06] i know
[1:57:09] how do we know that it is time for this
[1:57:11] and that together
[1:57:16] and he was quoting ecclesiastes chapter
[1:57:18] three verse one yeah
[1:57:22] i do not know on the on what perspective
[1:57:28] but it is true there is time for
[1:57:30] everything
[1:57:33] there are times whatever you say that
[1:57:36] and i regret that i can
[1:57:38] these days i've tried my best i'm still
[1:57:40] trying to find those times but it's
[1:57:42] becoming increasingly hard
[1:57:51] abuse someone what would he say that
[1:57:53] when again
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:55] and just get into those thickets
[1:58:01] oh i remember those moments
[1:58:04] now
[1:58:18] there are many things that have come
[1:58:19] into my life that have made it
[1:58:20] increasingly hard for me to be the way i
[1:58:22] was then
[1:58:24] yes
[1:58:28] themselves are not easy to be found
[1:58:33] even i'm not in the place where i used
[1:58:34] to be careers
[1:58:36] and uh if now i went with my car and i
[1:58:39] parked it somewhere on the road
[1:58:41] into a bush
[1:59:00] there are things that you can do
[1:59:01] sometimes
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:04] at some levels in your life
[1:59:08] you may never have another opportunity
[1:59:12] and you will continue with your work
[1:59:13] with god
[1:59:55] you know you have nobody asking you
[1:59:57] those questions
[2:00:00] but maybe your mother
[2:00:02] maybe your mother has one son
[2:00:06] as you grow older
[2:00:10] if you decide to go somewhere in a bush
[2:00:12] to pray for for two days who will pursue
[2:00:14] you organ
[2:00:21] brother alex if it is
[2:00:38] get up
[2:00:42] the person asking this question
[2:00:47] he said something that that when you
[2:00:49] skip something it comes back again to
[2:00:51] you that one turns into another corner
[2:00:58] as if
[2:01:00] to say that
[2:01:01] if
[2:01:02] you don't
[2:01:03] play
[2:01:04] football now you'll play it when you get
[2:01:06] older
[2:01:34] of football
[2:01:36] again
[2:01:38] there was a time although i could say
[2:01:40] that i really love football now you're
[2:01:41] gonna call me peter but not really a fan
[2:01:44] of my friends who are playing it
[2:01:48] whenever i would play
[2:02:00] and i've never been a footballer
[2:02:59] when you go to america now burgundy
[2:03:01] america the god of america
[2:03:04] america
[2:03:05] is a woman
[2:03:08] entertainment
[2:03:41] in america america they used to preach
[2:03:43] against
[2:03:44] me the bible says we should not fashion
[2:03:47] ourselves after the world
[2:03:50] but it would not fight
[2:03:51] anger and see so most of these things
[2:03:53] are really entertainment
[2:04:08] and maybe i'll be giving more details on
[2:04:09] that and all the histories of some of
[2:04:11] these things
[2:04:17] there's some
[2:04:19] games and entertainment that is not
[2:04:22] not bad well
[2:04:26] and i'm not saying that believers should
[2:04:28] not have any sort of entertainment
[2:04:36] but you must watch
[2:04:39] what type of entertainment do you engage
[2:04:41] in be cheery if you could send yourself
[2:04:43] away
[2:04:45] i think i've answered this question
[2:04:48] right so
[2:04:51] i have another question here
[2:04:55] is rude still here lucy
[2:04:58] where is that
[2:05:00] oh
[2:05:02] she forgot
[2:05:03] to ask the question
[2:05:05] why god loves people but he wants people
[2:05:07] to save
[2:05:09] really i'll need her to clarify
[2:05:12] to save him or to serve them i don't
[2:05:13] really understand i'll need ask yeah
[2:05:19] okay um
[2:05:22] i was asked this question
[2:05:24] by one of my denominational friends
[2:05:29] i need clarification on this verse
[2:05:46] foreign
[2:05:50] are you blood of your lives will i
[2:05:51] require at the hand of every beast will
[2:05:53] i require it and at the hand of man and
[2:05:56] at the hand of every man's brother will
[2:05:58] i require the life of man
[2:06:00] a
[2:06:11] [Music]
[2:06:59] [Music]
[2:07:19] [Music]
[2:07:31] of this scripture i don't understand the
[2:07:33] context
[2:07:34] um but um
[2:07:37] the scripture that comes to my mind
[2:07:38] right now
[2:07:43] if there is somebody
[2:07:47] talking about requiring
[2:07:49] blood on your head
[2:08:02] yes that might as well be
[2:08:05] by itself
[2:08:06] verse 5 might mean something else i'll
[2:08:08] need to have a deeper set on that but
[2:08:10] now there is another scripture
[2:08:13] that i wanted to look at
[2:08:20] okay i also don't see it quickly here
[2:08:22] but it says if
[2:08:23] you see someone doing wrong
[2:08:28] and you do not want them no time
[2:08:31] their blood will be required upon your
[2:08:32] head oh my god
[2:08:36] so that's the scripture that is coming
[2:08:38] close to this but i need to study um
[2:08:41] i'll surely deal with this on the video
[2:08:49] the question was why
[2:08:51] god
[2:08:52] needs
[2:08:53] blood of human lives this is not
[2:08:54] interpret your interpretation of this
[2:08:56] verse
[2:08:58] the person he is asking the question was
[2:09:00] why does god need blood of human lives
[2:09:09] i do not believe that god is demanding
[2:09:11] for human life
[2:09:15] i remember one day i was preaching and i
[2:09:16] said god requires blood
[2:09:21] yet
[2:09:22] the only sacrifice he has never
[2:09:25] asked for his human life
[2:09:30] of
[2:09:30] christ so i don't think that's the
[2:09:33] interpretation but i need to
[2:09:35] if you are it would have done me well
[2:09:37] who asked this question i never said
[2:09:39] are you here who are you i know
[2:09:42] okay so
[2:09:43] i will need your name can you put your
[2:09:45] name on take a kid
[2:09:47] i will need to be sure to send you the
[2:09:49] answer
[2:09:54] uh all right so there's another question
[2:09:56] here um
[2:10:05] no i don't believe that i lost okay i i
[2:10:08] will not just justice to this one again
[2:10:10] because i want to deal with them a
[2:10:11] little more
[2:10:12] but let's go a little over it okay
[2:10:15] and i love the questions you asked by
[2:10:17] the kid and they're quite deep as well
[2:10:18] says what did jesus mean when he said
[2:10:21] that
[2:10:24] why did what did jesus mean when he said
[2:10:26] that the last sh the last shall come
[2:10:28] first and the first last
[2:10:30] years
[2:10:36] many are called but few are chosen
[2:10:40] today
[2:10:53] another place in scripture where it
[2:10:55] speaks of
[2:10:56] those that were fast and those that were
[2:10:59] last but they all received the same
[2:11:01] rewards
[2:11:08] and speaking of this we can look at the
[2:11:10] church edges
[2:11:13] from the very first church
[2:11:16] all those were
[2:11:18] sleeping sleeping
[2:11:26] but the question is
[2:11:28] will they receive the reward yes
[2:11:32] they will receive the right phone name
[2:11:35] but
[2:11:35] yes we which are live
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:12:03] but the bible says we who are alive are
[2:12:05] and remain i believe i'm a father
[2:12:08] here's what the scripture says we shall
[2:12:10] not hinder them that are asleep
[2:12:14] he says that
[2:12:16] the sound when the last trump the
[2:12:18] sounding of the last trump of god again
[2:12:19] the content of the same bible did it for
[2:12:21] you the dead in christ are right about
[2:12:23] freedom christopher is okay that we wish
[2:12:25] our life and remain
[2:12:27] we shall be caught up to your quality
[2:12:29] one to meet
[2:12:31] with the lord together with them in the
[2:12:32] christian
[2:12:37] so
[2:12:37] but i know there is another aspect to
[2:12:39] that question and i'll get to it
[2:12:41] uh later
[2:12:59] [Music]
[2:13:27] [Music]
[2:13:28] but you did not know better
[2:13:32] it's just like the many vowels we make
[2:13:37] before we believe
[2:13:39] we make vows with
[2:13:41] gods
[2:14:12] you will run man
[2:14:13] and you make a vow no right either and
[2:14:15] they tell you to wear something
[2:14:17] every movie
[2:14:19] you will run man
[2:14:20] you make many vowels
[2:14:23] those vowels are made maybe
[2:14:34] christ sets you free from all those vows
[2:14:37] that you put in
[2:15:24] [Music]
[2:15:35] he is displeased
[2:15:38] the bible says
[2:15:39] he has a right i know
[2:15:42] you tell her you will not marry me
[2:15:45] now
[2:15:47] according to the bible
[2:16:01] the father physical father can do that
[2:16:16] eeries because you had made a vow okay
[2:16:21] you are actually set free from verb
[2:16:26] amen
[2:16:30] pastor is it possible for a person
[2:16:32] filled with the holy ghost to get a
[2:16:33] demon in him
[2:16:40] absolutely
[2:16:42] i do not believe
[2:16:44] i don't have to
[2:17:08] [Music]
[2:17:24] and you need to
[2:17:26] be
[2:17:26] delivered and receive the holy
[2:17:28] phenomenon
[2:17:30] right
[2:17:31] what if i like an unbeliever who is well
[2:17:35] charactered
[2:17:40] is
[2:17:42] well
[2:17:43] and i sent another brother to preach to
[2:17:45] her name
[2:17:49] i'm um
[2:18:36] he
[2:18:40] [Music]
[2:18:52] [Music]
[2:19:32] now
[2:20:14] but still have
[2:20:25] and i remember when i was in school
[2:20:26] there were not even summers
[2:20:28] before
[2:21:10] i'm
[2:21:38] does not
[2:21:58] [Music]
[2:22:06] is
[2:22:20] will
[2:22:47] because of a strong feeling
[2:23:44] you have a good
[2:23:58] sell everything
[2:24:12] he
[2:24:26] she's not she doesn't have christ
[2:24:28] crystal so it's not good character
[2:24:29] because there is a simpson knowing that
[2:24:30] behavior is as a human being
[2:24:34] but wait a moment
[2:24:36] make her hungry
[2:24:37] that's when you realize she has no
[2:24:38] character
[2:24:40] right
[2:24:41] and so is it brother says the man
[2:24:43] without the holy ghost is like a beast
[2:24:49] you see so friend
[2:24:52] what i would do change the color i'll
[2:24:53] then go to this car
[2:25:09] do it myself cuz they will not call
[2:25:10] anger i would always gather myself to
[2:25:13] preach
[2:25:16] so that i can give her a word
[2:25:20] this is what happened
[2:25:21] to kangaroo i would always talk about
[2:25:36] especially when you you can talk about
[2:25:38] trousers
[2:25:41] about women
[2:25:43] oh i would say that
[2:25:45] was a cat which is putting her nails
[2:26:22] [Music]
[2:26:48] but if it happens to be right never
[2:26:50] change the truth and she has a seed of
[2:26:52] god in her heart
[2:26:56] but if you are so much beaten by her
[2:26:58] name
[2:27:00] you know
[2:27:08] because
[2:27:11] if you cannot witness to somebody over
[2:27:13] the summer
[2:27:14] to because
[2:27:16] they they are attracting you
[2:27:19] it means even the spirit you were in
[2:27:21] against a normal
[2:27:22] is not the right spirit
[2:27:25] you're already overtaken
[2:27:28] and you need to come to the pastor
[2:27:43] hallelujah
[2:27:44] you are going to really pray for them
[2:27:49] and you're going to preach to them
[2:27:51] not not have feelings for them
[2:27:56] praise the lord too
[2:27:58] all right
[2:27:59] i answered that properly
[2:28:04] are you satisfied about that
[2:28:13] is it a mast
[2:28:15] that a black should not marry a white
[2:28:18] chapter
[2:28:24] oh it was just an advice
[2:28:31] and behind here america oh no he wrote
[2:28:34] something and he crossed it i mentioned
[2:28:35] about that one there's an extra did the
[2:28:37] prophet advise us not
[2:28:39] and they changed his mind
[2:28:44] he said is it a mask
[2:28:47] so you already know what the prophet
[2:28:48] says
[2:28:50] what the prophet says
[2:29:06] all right i i i i
[2:29:10] if you want my opinion i'll give you my
[2:29:11] opinion
[2:29:15] but if you want the word you have to
[2:29:16] what never boy i got a chicken
[2:29:18] already
[2:29:19] we only have one dress fetullina fetus
[2:29:22] that's a christian right
[2:29:25] right i mean
[2:29:27] you can as well say we have only one
[2:29:28] human race
[2:29:34] but brother
[2:29:40] because god doesn't like me god is not a
[2:29:42] mixer and he doesn't like mexico
[2:29:58] yes
[2:29:59] you know they're not white they're not
[2:30:00] black
[2:30:34] [Music]
[2:30:41] [Music]
[2:30:43] and he loves them all and he doesn't
[2:30:46] want you to cross it
[2:30:48] will go besides him let it be in his
[2:30:50] beauty like
[2:30:54] you would have shouted a man
[2:30:58] somebody said
[2:31:12] africa
[2:31:14] every young man
[2:31:17] of hollywood
[2:31:18] all they would do they dreamed
[2:31:26] but that's the
[2:31:29] the spirit of our
[2:31:31] of our continent
[2:31:35] can i would i be right if i say it is
[2:31:36] not the spirit of christ
[2:31:43] right
[2:31:44] all right so
[2:31:46] i think that answers that
[2:31:50] but on
[2:31:52] on those on that
[2:31:54] uh i answered again by answering you
[2:31:57] that we have one race and that is at the
[2:31:58] christian race
[2:32:08] you want to be a mixer
[2:32:11] is it good for a sister to hug a brother
[2:32:20] so this means it is a sister asking
[2:32:22] again
[2:32:50] m
[2:34:00] ghost
[2:34:02] as long as you are a man and you are
[2:34:03] alive and you are blood in your veins
[2:34:09] you will not be the same after hugging
[2:34:11] them
[2:34:46] [Music]
[2:34:56] [Music]
[2:36:15] oh if you have met
[2:36:16] for the first time even if you have met
[2:36:17] for the first time
[2:36:32] you
[2:37:42] i was just reading between the lines
[2:37:44] when i was looking at my wife
[2:38:00] i tell you to get started in ethiopia
[2:38:05] it means you don't like our food
[2:38:27] she fed my wife my wife also named
[2:38:30] charlotte
[2:38:33] and i was there too in hungary
[2:38:37] it was really weird
[2:38:40] but after a few years
[2:38:42] i preached to the believers
[2:38:45] about culture
[2:38:48] versus the world nature the world has
[2:38:50] its own culture
[2:38:54] we have our
[2:39:36] no
[2:39:50] please stop hugging brothers
[2:39:56] it is not good
[2:39:58] the bible says that a woman should not
[2:40:00] put on anything oh i mean across that is
[2:40:03] for a man does it mean that a woman
[2:40:07] cannot put on a man's jacket
[2:40:20] [Music]
[2:40:31] a man a brother a woman omokazee should
[2:40:34] not wear that which pertaining
[2:40:43] all right so in other words
[2:40:46] he's not saying husband wife or
[2:40:47] something or like me putting on my
[2:40:49] wife's car for something
[2:40:56] out of my head
[2:41:14] that which is like unto a madness
[2:41:27] a man or a woman

[2:42:07] very very very ugly
[2:42:52] the way i am
[2:42:54] there is no hips coming out
[2:42:56] i could take a vibe i was a woman when a
[2:42:58] man was wearing a trouser
[2:43:01] in paris
[2:43:02] like that today women who think they are
[2:43:05] men
[2:43:12] and you know so really
[2:43:14] it's impossible for a woman to dress a
[2:43:16] trouser and she doesn't show the format
[2:43:19] of her body
[2:43:32] it actually
[2:43:34] i'll not use the what i was going to use
[2:43:35] in the middle there but i would say it
[2:43:37] attracts naturally attracts
[2:43:39] the eyes of a man
[2:43:47] he is a man of god his own heart
[2:44:43] before god
[2:44:53] [Music]
[2:45:08] and that's why women should dress
[2:45:11] clothes that cover their body
[2:45:26] you see
[2:45:39] so
[2:45:41] so you see
[2:45:43] sometimes we say as long as it is below
[2:45:45] the knee automatically
[2:45:48] and some they just dress up
[2:45:54] and then when they they sit there when i
[2:45:56] told that this cat comes that name okay
[2:45:58] no so you have a problem actually even
[2:46:00] away so i hope i've answered that
[2:46:02] if a sister wants to jog for health
[2:46:06] issues
[2:46:38] you are a christian when you are
[2:46:39] swimming you are a christian when you
[2:46:41] are joking you are a christian in the
[2:46:43] everywhere you are here

[2:46:53] vow to the girlfriend after believing
[2:46:56] the message what is the way forward

[2:47:30] just finish them right quick
[2:47:32] mango how can one come to get a close
[2:47:36] connection with god because most of the
[2:47:38] youth try their best but in most cases
[2:47:41] things fail i personally i get
[2:47:42] challenges which i cannot be open to
[2:47:45] anyone so i'm kindly requesting for both
[2:47:47] advice and help
[2:47:53] [Music]

[2:48:03] through reading the word
[2:48:11] and if you need help or advice come come
[2:48:13] see me over here
[2:48:28] [Music]
[2:48:42] in many ways
[2:48:44] next to others
[2:48:47] you can um you know sing in church
[2:48:52] departments here there's a video
[2:48:53] department review my video this
[2:48:56] you know
[2:49:01] [Music]
[2:49:52] the what they're teaching
[2:49:56] about according to the world
[2:50:00] number two
[2:50:01] their life
[2:50:03] before they preach they don't leave
[2:50:18] [Music]
[2:50:44] character and conduct the prophet says
[2:50:46] one should marry one whom she or he
[2:50:50] can't live without now question what if
[2:50:53] she or he is an unbeliever but when all
[2:50:56] his or her conduct and all
[2:50:57] characteristics show that he or she can
[2:50:59] believe
[2:51:16] who
[2:52:07] [Music]
[2:53:09] have split up and their children and
[2:53:10] everything
[2:53:14] or he becomes a throne in your life
[2:53:17] another decision you make once and
[2:53:19] forever
[2:53:31] i understand that what marries one is
[2:53:34] the acceptance of a proposal for
[2:53:37] marriage
[2:53:39] [Music]
[2:53:43] under what circumstances does this
[2:53:45] proposal become null and void
[2:53:47] [Music]
[2:54:49] is it adultery if a lady has something
[2:54:51] like like six children from different
[2:54:53] men whereby she's not married of any of
[2:54:56] them
[2:55:00] okay
[2:55:15] with many men
[2:55:18] it's just like that woman who met jesus
[2:55:20] with the prostitute
[2:55:26] and she
[2:55:27] um she had she had had six five and then
[2:55:30] he was living with the sickness
[2:55:38] and jesus said that none of them is your
[2:55:40] husband yes
[2:55:58] [Music]
[2:56:24] is
[2:56:48] all right i have one more here
[2:56:51] it says the elect believers on their
[2:56:55] death
[2:56:58] foot
[2:56:59] go to the 16th dimension
[2:57:03] and the non-believers
[2:57:07] goes to the fifth dimension
[2:57:11] on the second resurrection
[2:57:14] there are those people that are
[2:57:16] separated
[2:57:34] who get salvation opportunity thereafter
[2:57:38] judgment
[2:57:39] before this
[2:57:41] when their faith is not yet decided
[2:57:44] which dimension are they the sixth
[2:57:46] or the fifth
[2:57:49] i mean
[2:57:50] so the brother is asking
[2:57:52] about that
[2:57:55] i don't know if all of you know
[2:57:56] dimensions
[2:58:00] fourth dimension in science
[2:58:06] [Music]
[2:58:10] the souls that are
[2:58:13] uh are sleeping this one is saying that
[2:58:16] they mentioned and the non-believers
[2:58:18] well the fifth dimension which is hell
[2:58:25] okay so he says that the unbelievers
[2:58:28] they go to the fifth dimension
[2:58:45] who have unto that when
[2:58:48] they on the on the white front judgment
[2:58:52] they don't go to the rapture
[2:58:56] but they die what would happen
[2:58:58] others remain here but they die still um
[2:59:02] and then after they were the millennia
[2:59:07] on the white throne judgment
[2:59:25] but here is one thing i want to correct
[2:59:27] why don't you never go to today but the
[2:59:28] bottom says that
[2:59:31] that life the eternal life that there's
[2:59:33] nobody going to get eternal life on the
[2:59:35] white front judge
[2:59:40] whatever
[2:59:46] [Music]
[2:59:57] and in
[2:59:58] in the but those souls that will receive
[3:00:02] grace whatever the meme is definitely on
[3:00:04] the white front judgment
[3:00:06] in general is because they had already
[3:00:08] received it
[3:00:12] this way
[3:00:13] right now now now now catch you when you
[3:00:15] are getting it someone is getting saved
[3:00:17] why do you want him and they are
[3:00:19] receiving christ
[3:00:20] crystal is that right it's true
[3:00:22] but they
[3:00:36] when they die
[3:00:40] because all those who believe in christ
[3:00:41] got one place
[3:00:43] in christopher
[3:00:44] remember these were virgins but nobody
[3:00:46] invaded they were in the same place for
[3:00:48] him and when the trumpet sounded the
[3:00:50] corner of the africa
[3:01:18] when they died
[3:01:22] and if
[3:01:23] anybody believes on the lord i i i do
[3:01:27] not exactly know if they were with with
[3:01:29] the others with the the others who were
[3:01:32] on the sixth dimension
[3:01:34] i don't exactly know if they were with
[3:01:36] the
[3:01:37] others who were
[3:01:38] waiting to get resurrection
[3:01:44] this is one that i want to
[3:01:47] look at more more carefully
[3:01:50] who shall be these kings
[3:01:53] of the earth bringing
[3:01:55] uh
[3:01:56] glory into this okay i don't understand
[3:01:59] this into this city okay can you read
[3:02:01] for me revelation 21
[3:02:07] i really mean
[3:02:14] bible yeah
[3:02:27] okay and so who will be those kings
[3:02:33] and
[3:02:34] okay can you read that in english for me
[3:02:40] i think he's talking about the city
[3:02:56] 24. and the nations of them which are
[3:02:59] saved shall walk in the light of it
[3:03:03] and the kings of the earth
[3:03:06] do bring their glory
[3:03:09] and honor into it
[3:03:11] and the gates of it shall not be shut at
[3:03:14] all by day for there shall be no night
[3:03:16] there
[3:03:17] now i believe
[3:03:19] that the bible says we the bride
[3:03:22] are the kings and the priests i believe
[3:03:36] the moment you believe christ and
[3:03:37] receive the holy ghost kid is a
[3:03:39] christian
[3:03:41] you you come into arroyo
[3:03:43] into royals
[3:03:47] you become a king
[3:03:49] and you become a priest
[3:03:52] and i believe
[3:03:53] it will be us
[3:03:55] in that new city
[3:03:58] and we will also have glory because it
[3:04:00] says
[3:04:02] which part is that
[3:04:03] and they shall walk okay they shall walk
[3:04:04] in the light okay of course we always
[3:04:06] sing the song we will walk in the light
[3:04:07] the beautiful light okay then he says
[3:04:09] uh which verse is that again this
[3:04:12] 20
[3:04:14] 24
[3:04:15] and the nations of them which are saved
[3:04:17] shall walk in the light of it and the
[3:04:19] kings of the earth shall bring their
[3:04:20] glory into it
[3:04:33] that
[3:04:35] there in for the lord god almighty and
[3:04:37] the lamb are the temple of it
[3:04:39] and i believe that all those people
[3:04:41] because there are those that are saved
[3:04:42] but not kings not in royalty not not not
[3:04:46] the bride well yeah
[3:05:00] [Music]
[3:05:07] okay there's another one here but all
[3:05:09] these questions that brother you've
[3:05:11] asked i need to go through them again
[3:05:13] when i'm not tired
[3:05:27] because at this youthful age it's when
[3:05:29] boys and girls are attracted to each
[3:05:31] other
[3:05:32] and they
[3:05:33] and they jump
[3:05:35] pitch it can come back
[3:05:38] in the future when one is over
[3:05:41] continuation of the first
[3:05:42] time for everything okay
[3:05:58] let me
[3:06:29] so
[3:06:30] we are done with all the questions we've
[3:06:31] gone through with most of them i see i
[3:06:33] have i am not the one who asked that
[3:06:36] question i would
[3:06:37] like you pastor to talk about
[3:06:39] forgiveness be biblically
[3:06:47] irrespective
[3:06:48] of what it is
[3:06:51] okay you're saying you're not the one
[3:06:53] who asked the question about forgiveness
[3:06:54] but you want to admit about forgiveness
[3:07:08] i do not know which aspect the brother
[3:07:10] brother can you explain on your question
[3:07:15] clarifying this question
[3:07:36] that's why i said i'll go in detail in
[3:07:39] need but um
[3:07:41] i just say that believers forgive
[3:07:45] us
[3:07:46] i don't think you can explain
[3:07:47] forgiveness i don't know
[3:07:50] some people have hearts that they can't
[3:07:52] forgive somebody even when someone asked
[3:07:54] for forgiveness
[3:07:59] on you
[3:08:01] but
[3:08:01] the scripture teaches us
[3:08:04] to say if someone has done something
[3:08:06] against your mother nature because they
[3:08:08] listen
[3:08:10] go to them gain their charity
[3:08:14] don't wait for them to come to you
[3:08:16] turning that yes maybe they don't know
[3:08:18] that they
[3:08:38] [Music]
[3:09:12] you are alone
[3:09:23] i'd like a young man with a good a good
[3:09:26] a good answer for to this to come and
[3:09:28] share
[3:09:43] is this brother someone

[3:11:08] perfect answer hey
[3:11:10] truth i cannot get a better answer so
