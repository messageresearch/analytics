[22:32] service yesterday we also did not have

[22:37] [Music]
[22:39] like before we go into the world to let
[22:40] you know that the lord willing we are
[22:42] moving
[22:43] [Music]
[22:48] we have already
[22:51] maybe i'll just tell you this we were
[22:53] praying of course to go to our own land
[22:59] and that's still our target we are
[23:01] believing for that
[23:04] and we are continuing with our
[23:05] contributions
[23:12] [Music]
[23:36] [Music]
[23:44] um
[23:45] actually most of the pieces of
[23:48] of land in good areas are 180 160 170
[23:52] 190.
[23:58] but we shall reach the board
[23:59] [Music]
[24:02] loves us
[24:29] so the lord knew we needed a better
[24:31] place
[24:33] in the twitter
[24:34] singapore
[24:35] it's very expensive to get a better
[24:36] place
[24:43] the owner of
[24:58] there is another church in that hall
[25:00] that they have
[25:02] can you say
[25:04] uh but you should know that most of the
[25:06] hotels actually do not rent out their
[25:08] holes to churches
[25:11] water is a singaporean
[25:47] [Music]
[25:55] so their hall has been used it's been uh
[25:59] they were they had rented it out to a
[26:01] church oh yeah wait you're what we can
[26:03] see are you japan i think they've been
[26:05] there for about five years
[26:08] so
[26:40] well i have to do that so that he
[26:43] he may think we are not really so much
[26:45] in need so that he doesn't increase the
[26:46] money now you're getting away
[26:48] for about two months
[26:57] and i was talking with a brother that
[26:59] whole should really be at least 2
[27:01] million above
[27:16] some people don't understand why because
[27:18] in this place we sit
[27:20] squeezed
[27:24] and the maximum of 100 can get here
[27:31] right
[27:33] a maximum of 100 can get it
[27:41] and the whole sits more than 300.
[27:46] and we rent four hundred thousand a year
[27:49] one or two pounds
[27:51] but we will be renting five hundred
[27:52] thousand dollars
[27:55] that is a miracle
[27:59] that's a miracle
[28:00] it's
[28:15] is
[28:29] okay so i need to see the document you
[28:32] sent me here
[28:34] so we we collected on on sunday
[28:37] sunday
[28:40] but
[28:42] we did not finish the whole psalm
[28:46] are you i might not be able to get
[28:49] uh the document right peak i do not plan
[28:51] to how about going
[28:56] on uh do you have an estimate brother
[29:02] do you have an estimate
[29:05] on the remaining amount of the people
[29:07] what the people collected on sunday
[29:11] the amount that you and brother andrew
[29:12] are supposed to pay
[29:15] well you better tell me so that i can
[29:17] save you here
[29:18] brother andrew you remember the amount
[29:20] no
[29:23] 230 okay that is if we are collecting
[29:25] 400 000 so we need about 400 thousand
[29:28] now katie traitor guy named that's an
[29:30] estimate
[29:32] so if you've not pledged anything robert
[29:34] alina
[29:36] we need four hundred thousand straight
[29:37] again remainder
[29:48] we will be
[29:50] having our first service there on third
[29:53] august
[29:56] okay
[30:00] so the first would be our last service
[30:06] those who do not
[30:14] [Music]
[30:22] [Music]
[31:02] praise the lord come here so probably we
[31:04] will do the we'll pick the pledges
[31:06] brother the deacons will pass some
[31:08] papers to those who do not pledge on
[31:09] sunday after the service so that they
[31:11] can do the pledge for the 400.
[31:15] so
[31:26] a
[32:42] faith now faith is the substance of
[32:44] things hoped for
[32:46] the evidence of things not seen
[32:50] for by it the elders obtained a good
[32:52] report
[32:54] is
[33:20] we give this service to you this morning
[33:36] may you just come and take over
[33:38] forget speak to us look on our faith and
[33:41] may we be energized spiritually today
[33:46] whatever trouble we have come with
[33:48] your neighbors
[33:50] with it today
[34:25] praise the lord come here
[34:27] is the lord good
[34:31] is the lord good bananji
[34:43] i'm praying that you will begin it today
[34:48] [Music]
[34:53] so this morning i i'm going to deal with
[34:56] uh a subject i think
[34:59] of course we speak about it every day
[35:01] but every service but today i'm going to
[35:04] go on it head-on
[35:12] my subject is the sixth sense
[35:22] now the scripture here in hebrews begins
[35:24] by saying now faith is the substance of
[35:26] things hoped for one word
[35:29] [Music]
[35:53] now by faith verse 5 enoch was
[35:56] translated that you should not see this
[36:02] and it was not found
[36:04] because god had translated
[36:08] now i met i had some preachers who were
[36:10] saying that enoch was not ruptured
[36:15] because how could he have been raptured
[36:17] before the death of jesus christ
[36:22] sounds nice
[36:24] but actually
[36:42] and the enoch was a type of the seventh
[36:46] church age bride enoch
[36:59] it is a period of time that god or
[37:02] christ will take in order to gather
[37:04] himself for himself a bride so you know
[37:06] chivang it
[37:14] the resurrection of jesus christ and his
[37:15] ascension to heaven
[37:20] up to the time
[37:43] who has come and said these are not just
[37:44] churches which were uh just in
[37:48] historical churches
[38:31] characteristics
[38:34] that we are pointing to the future
[38:36] generation
[38:37] is the song that needed to make your
[38:39] mind so and that these would be
[38:41] appearing or times and times that god
[38:43] would deal with a gentile
[38:58] by sending a
[39:09] message was the one that god used to now
[39:11] call out a bride from
[39:54] the bible now says in the book of the
[39:56] colonials bible remember
[39:58] that at the last trump of god which is
[40:01] under the same dead in christ shall rise
[40:07] and we who are alive
[40:26] [Applause]
[41:58] all the mysteries of god in this fiber
[42:00] will be
[42:51] [Applause]
[44:22] but without faith
[44:24] it is impossible to please him
[44:30] let us read verse 6 together
[44:34] but without i want to hear you reading
[44:36] with me one two three go but without
[44:39] faith
[44:40] it is impossible to please him
[44:46] for he that cometh to god
[44:50] must believe
[44:56] when you come to god for charity you
[44:59] hear this
[45:01] message
[45:15] and that is a reward of them that
[45:18] diligently sick
[45:22] without faith
[45:24] it is impossible to please god someone
[45:26] has sent me
[45:27] why did he not praise god
[45:30] because he walked with
[45:59] when he was going into the cycles about
[46:00] how the five senses of on the outer
[46:03] reveal
[46:11] five senses to the
[46:12] body there's only one way you can get
[46:15] into the body that's by those five
[46:16] senses
[46:20] there's no other way to contract the
[46:21] body
[46:23] test field here
[46:33] and he also has five senses
[46:55] the only stock
[47:00] they can just like the corn of the field
[47:02] and weed in the field they can be
[47:04] anointed with the same holy spirit that
[47:07] the real believer is anointed with
[47:16] [Music]
[47:22] foreign
[47:48] now i want to show you brother you can
[47:49] stop that chair let me let me share
[47:50] something for you here
[47:53] praise the name of the lord
[47:55] brother can you project it for me
[48:00] all right so now
[48:02] i want to show you this stream being
[48:04] here
[48:06] you know
[48:08] everybody says it clean
[48:12] your mind
[48:14] all right so here we have man one on two
[48:17] this is who you are who i am
[48:19] [Music]
[48:32] you know these are the
[48:47] [Music]
[49:00] that way more
[49:02] now the spirit also has five senses
[49:06] that's memory
[49:10] imagination
[49:12] and reasoning
[49:14] now
[49:17] [Music]
[49:22] your spirit can be able to uh to have
[49:25] affection
[49:27] you know to contact things in this world
[49:56] one of us brought him on to things that
[49:58] touch us things that we have memory
[50:01] truly now
[50:02] you see but then this is the spirit man
[50:07] but inside of the spirit man
[50:10] is
[50:17] so i'm not talking about something
[50:18] foreign
[50:30] [Music]
[50:47] [Music]
[51:53] [Music]
[52:01] [Music]
[52:45] prophet was talking about here
[52:47] obviously
[52:48] not many christians
[52:50] they get filled with a spirit on their
[52:53] body like
[52:55] they get anointed with a spirit on their
[52:57] body that phenomenal
[53:29] [Music]
[53:50] [Music]
[53:52] the holy spirit
[54:05] [Music]
[54:22] no that they can easily
[54:26] connect
[54:27] with the spirit of god
[54:31] you know if you want to know you know
[54:33] actually in the book of uh i think
[54:35] esther it is
[54:42] it talks about the
[54:45] uh receiving
[54:46] a new heart
[54:50] a new
[54:57] [Music]
[55:04] accepting to follow jesus
[55:07] and you also receive a new spirit
[55:12] without having the holy ghost

[55:40] with our very vulgar imagination
[55:45] we are born with wrong and demonic and
[55:48] satanic reasoning
[55:54] whatever god gives you his word
[56:00] you know in
[56:32] all right now all of us are born that's
[56:35] a network's already where to kill okay
[56:36] our memory

[1:03:43] a that's why they call believers fools
[1:03:49] they will ask you but
