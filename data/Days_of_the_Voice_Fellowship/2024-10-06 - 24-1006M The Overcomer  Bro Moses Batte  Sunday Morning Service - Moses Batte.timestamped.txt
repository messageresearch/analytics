[1:55:34] way glory be to God if I die or if I
[1:55:39] live I'm a
[1:55:41] winner either
[1:55:44] way I'm here to tell you we are
[1:55:48] winners because it was already declared
[1:55:50] in the scriptures
[1:55:53] that you are more than
[1:55:55] conquerors in Christ
[1:55:58] Jesus God cannot speak
[1:56:01] that before he sees the end of the
[1:56:05] battle God declares a winner from the
[1:56:09] beginning Hallelujah so he said through
[1:56:13] Paul you are
[1:56:16] conquerors in Christ
[1:56:19] Jesus hallelujah amen why because
[1:56:23] God Amen saw the end from the
[1:56:29] beginning glory be to God that's why the
[1:56:32] prophet
[1:56:32] says if the

[1:57:25] Fire it is waiting for
[1:57:30] you praise
[1:57:32] God so we are going to speak
[1:57:35] about un
[1:57:38] Overcomer picking my
[1:57:41] inspiration from that message how can I
[1:57:47] overcome praise the Lord amen how can I
[1:57:50] overcome
[1:57:52] amen amen
[1:57:54] because just like I've told
[1:57:57] you that all the
[1:58:01] materials whatever you
[1:58:04] need From Here to
[1:58:08] Eternity it is with
[1:58:11] you hallelujah amen I always tell my
[1:58:16] church I tell the
[1:58:19] people that before God delivered the
[1:58:22] children of
[1:58:25] Israel before bringing them out of
[1:58:29] Egypt God
[1:58:32] prepared whatsoever they need in the
[1:58:37] journey
[1:58:39] out to the promised
[1:58:42] land it was already
[1:58:44] there God was
[1:58:48] ready hallelujah amen all the materials
[1:58:53] all the
[1:58:54] equipments whatever that is
[1:58:58] necessary to take them to the promised
[1:59:01] land was
[1:59:03] there Hallelujah so it was about his
[1:59:08] people toze
[1:59:11] them hallelujah amen praise God amen
[1:59:15] amen amen so when God begins a
[1:59:19] work hallelujah amen finishes
[1:59:24] it actually God finishes the
[1:59:27] work from the
[1:59:31] start amen hallelujah amen that's what
[1:59:36] the Bible
[1:59:37] says look unto
[1:59:40] Jesus
[1:59:44] the
[1:59:46] the and a
[1:59:49] finisher of our faith
[1:59:55] is the one who
[1:59:56] begins and is the one who
[1:59:59] finishes glory be to God Amen so if you
[2:00:02] want to become an
[2:00:05] overcomer what you must
[2:00:07] do is just one
[2:00:09] thing take your
[2:00:13] eyes take your
[2:00:15] eyes from all
[2:00:18] things and look unto Jesus
[2:00:23] amen there is a
[2:00:26] message which was preached in our
[2:00:30] days which was
[2:00:33] titled Look Away to
[2:00:38] Jesus it
[2:00:40] means take your eyes away from all
[2:00:46] things and look away unto Jesus
[2:00:52] for the
[2:00:54] Au and the
[2:00:57] finisher of our
[2:01:01] face if you can do
[2:01:04] that you'll be an
[2:01:06] overcomer in any
[2:01:09] way hallelujah amen because the battle
[2:01:13] is not
[2:01:14] yours neither
[2:01:17] mine hallelujah amen but the battle is
[2:01:21] is of the Lord
[2:01:23] glory be to God Amen so I'm going to
[2:01:26] speak about
[2:01:27] that picking my
[2:01:30] inspiration that message how can I
[2:01:34] overcome hallelujah amen praise the Lord
[2:01:38] amen because everything was laid before
[2:01:40] us
[2:01:41] here all the materials are here no
[2:01:45] excuse everything to defeat that Devil
[2:01:48] Is With
[2:01:49] Us Praise the Lord amen
[2:01:52] amen I always tell
[2:01:54] people that the problem we are
[2:01:57] facing amen sometimes we have weapons
[2:02:01] but we don't know how how to use
[2:02:07] them just imagine a
[2:02:10] policeman having a gun amen and he being
[2:02:13] chased by somebody with a with with a
[2:02:15] bon with a
[2:02:18] stick praise the Lord amen he has a gun
[2:02:22] but he doesn't
[2:02:23] know
[2:02:26] amen how destructive it
[2:02:30] is praise the Lord with a gun you don't
[2:02:33] have to get close to to the
[2:02:36] enemy you can shoot it's a long
[2:02:40] range praise the Lord am but somebody
[2:02:42] with a stick has to get close to
[2:02:47] you now look at the policeman
[2:02:50] running running from somebody who is
[2:02:53] having a
[2:02:55] stick hallelujah amen so I believe what
[2:02:58] we are
[2:02:59] having is even more than a
[2:03:03] God glory be to Jesus so we are
[2:03:06] Overcomers in either
[2:03:09] way praise the Lord if we can if we can
[2:03:12] learn how to place how to
[2:03:17] utilize praise the lord we are
[2:03:19] Overcomers
[2:03:21] amen amen so we are talking about
[2:03:25] that now we have seen in the scriptures
[2:03:28] here Book of
[2:03:31] Revelation where the Lord says behold I
[2:03:33] stand up a door and
[2:03:36] knock any man hear my
[2:03:39] voice and open the
[2:03:42] door I'll come in to him and will sh
[2:03:47] with
[2:03:48] him with
[2:03:50] me amen
[2:03:52] Amen to him that
[2:03:54] overcomes will I gr to sit with
[2:03:58] me in my
[2:04:00] throne even also as I
[2:04:04] overcame praise the Lord amen so the
[2:04:07] prophet tells us that the Lord was
[2:04:10] speaking to this last
[2:04:13] age this age isan Church
[2:04:17] Ag and God was rebuking this age
[2:04:23] praise the Lord amen because it's the
[2:04:26] age where the Lord
[2:04:29] speaks when he outside of
[2:04:32] it it's out of the
[2:04:35] church and he rebuking it from
[2:04:39] outside and he speak and is's
[2:04:42] calling amen he's telling
[2:04:47] knocking whoever hears my
[2:04:50] voice and
[2:04:53] hallelujah amen If any man hear my
[2:04:57] voice open the
[2:04:59] door I come into
[2:05:02] him and will with
[2:05:05] him and he with
[2:05:08] me God is Not yearning to enter into the
[2:05:14] church as an
[2:05:19] AG pray the Lord Desiring to
[2:05:24] enter into the
[2:05:27] temple Hallelujah if you hear my
[2:05:31] voice it is a
[2:05:34] singular it's not a
[2:05:36] plural If any man hears My
[2:05:40] Voice Hallelujah and opens for
[2:05:45] me I will
[2:05:48] enter hallelujah it's an individual
[2:05:53] glory be to God to hear the voice of the
[2:05:56] Lord and to open for him he will enter
[2:06:01] in he will sh with you and thou sh with
[2:06:06] him hallelujah amen and he said unto
[2:06:10] him he said unto
[2:06:14] him praise the Lord to
[2:06:18] him this is a personal thing
[2:06:23] praise the Lord amen so that's how the
[2:06:25] Bible is
[2:06:27] written in this age glory be to God and
[2:06:31] you know very
[2:06:32] well when the Lord
[2:06:34] was when the Lord was dealing with a
[2:06:37] with with with the
[2:06:39] Jews he deals with the
[2:06:42] Jews as a
[2:06:45] nation hallelujah amen but when it comes
[2:06:48] to the Gentiles
[2:06:51] God deals with us as an
[2:06:56] individual not as a
[2:06:58] group that's why he says he that Hearth
[2:07:01] my
[2:07:03] voice he that Hearth
[2:07:06] me Hallelujah he that
[2:07:10] overcomes it is an individual one
[2:07:14] person amen amen I will grant to sit
[2:07:18] with
[2:07:20] me with my
[2:07:23] throne in with me in my
[2:07:26] throne even as I also
[2:07:29] overcame and I'm set down with my
[2:07:33] father he
[2:07:35] overcame he overcame that's why he SE in
[2:07:39] the how many desire to sit in
[2:07:44] the must be an
[2:07:47] overcomer there is something that you
[2:07:49] must fight
[2:07:51] must
[2:07:53] F
[2:07:55] to
[2:07:57] amen so the Lord
[2:08:00] fought and he
[2:08:02] overcame in verse 22
[2:08:04] says he that has an
[2:08:08] ear one
[2:08:10] person he that has
[2:08:13] un let him hear what a
[2:08:17] spirit says unto the churches
[2:08:23] churches are
[2:08:25] many but one
[2:08:29] person praise the Lord amen and the
[2:08:32] prophet preached the
[2:08:34] message the five definite
[2:08:40] identifications of the True Church of
[2:08:42] the Living
[2:08:44] God hallelujah amen and it told
[2:08:49] us what the church is
[2:08:53] what is the
[2:08:55] church hallelujah amen and he
[2:08:59] said the church is the called out
[2:09:07] one that called out
[2:09:14] one that church is the called out one
[2:09:22] ated and is made
[2:09:26] different praise the Lord amen that is
[2:09:29] the
[2:09:32] church the called out
[2:09:35] one
[2:09:37] separated made
[2:09:40] different for the
[2:09:43] service of a certain
[2:09:46] Kingdom hallelujah amen so that's what
[2:09:49] the church is
[2:09:51] it's an individual
[2:09:55] Affair hallelujah amen it's an
[2:09:57] individual
[2:10:04] Affair it's not a group
[2:10:07] Affair and it
[2:10:09] says when
[2:10:11] God before he call the children of
[2:10:15] Israel out of the land of
[2:10:17] Egypt they were called his people
[2:10:22] but they were not the Church of
[2:10:25] God but when they came out of
[2:10:29] Egypt and they got into the
[2:10:33] Wilderness then God called them the
[2:10:37] church why because they were called
[2:10:41] out they were
[2:10:44] separated from the thingss of
[2:10:47] Egypt to serve
[2:10:49] God so they became the Church of
[2:10:53] God and God was now giving them his
[2:10:58] instructions when they were still in
[2:11:00] Egypt God could not there is no way God
[2:11:04] could give them
[2:11:07] instructions because they were mixed
[2:11:10] up the Egyptians are giving them their
[2:11:14] orders Hallelujah their
[2:11:17] Traditions their cultures
[2:11:23] hallelujah amen so it was hard for
[2:11:26] them to grasp the word of
[2:11:29] God so God had to separate
[2:11:32] them and put them in a
[2:11:35] place where they
[2:11:37] separated where God can give them his
[2:11:41] instructions where they were called The
[2:11:43] Church of
[2:11:45] God were call the Church of God in the
[2:11:48] desert
[2:11:51] praise the Lord now when it comes to us
[2:11:54] the
[2:11:55] Gentiles it is
[2:11:58] different God does not deal with us as a
[2:12:02] group God deal with
[2:12:04] you as an
[2:12:07] individual so we can as well
[2:12:09] say when you're still in the
[2:12:12] world that is
[2:12:14] Egypt there was an influence upon
[2:12:18] you the influence of the world
[2:12:22] was upon
[2:12:23] you Hallelujah God wanted to make you a
[2:12:27] different
[2:12:28] person so God had to bring you out he
[2:12:32] had to separate you from
[2:12:35] Egypt Hallelujah to the
[2:12:40] Wilderness amen amen you know Wilderness
[2:12:45] Wilderness represent
[2:12:49] sanctification praise the Lord amen so I
[2:12:51] have to call you out and sanctify
[2:12:55] you praise the Lord amen to make you
[2:12:59] different amen because you have become a
[2:13:02] church
[2:13:03] now that called out
[2:13:05] one
[2:13:07] separated and made
[2:13:09] different Hallelujah to serve in the
[2:13:12] kingdom of
[2:13:14] God praise the Lord am so if you get
[2:13:17] that
[2:13:18] Revelation do not serve God as a
[2:13:22] group glory be to God Amen Hallelujah
[2:13:26] for example now if God
[2:13:29] comes and he says in this place I'll
[2:13:33] take one
[2:13:38] person who would be that
[2:13:41] person some people say
[2:13:44] Pastor maybe maybe brother M because the
[2:13:48] way we see him the way he walks with the
[2:13:50] word
[2:13:52] I think he's the one who is worthy to be
[2:13:54] taken glory be to God Amen but I want to
[2:13:57] tell
[2:13:58] you me I cannot give it to the
[2:14:01] pastor I can't give it to brother I
[2:14:04] can't give it to any sister if God is
[2:14:07] coming to
[2:14:08] one it is
[2:14:11] I it is I because a Church of
[2:14:16] God who was called
[2:14:19] out amen
[2:14:21] hallelujah amen so now that teaches
[2:14:26] me that when it comes to serve
[2:14:29] God I not serve God under the influence
[2:14:33] of a
[2:14:34] group amen am if we come here in the
[2:14:38] church and the song
[2:14:40] leader say let us worship
[2:14:43] God hallelujah look at Brother Martin
[2:14:48] whether is
[2:14:50] worshiping
[2:14:51] worshiping or is not
[2:14:54] worshiping Hallelujah not be influenced
[2:14:57] by him I will
[2:14:59] worship why because I am the called out
[2:15:04] one I am the separated
[2:15:07] one if it comes to
[2:15:10] support the work of God not look where
[2:15:15] so is
[2:15:16] supporting is not
[2:15:18] supporting how support
[2:15:21] because I was
[2:15:24] [Applause]
[2:15:25] called I'm a called one I'm a separated
[2:15:30] one to Ser the
[2:15:33] kingom glory be to God amen amen amen
[2:15:37] when it comes to
[2:15:39] worship when it comes to
[2:15:41] give I'll not look at
[2:15:44] one I'll look at
[2:15:47] myself if something is not going well in
[2:15:49] the church
[2:15:51] I not look at Brother
[2:15:54] s look at sister
[2:15:56] s is my
[2:15:58] responsibility because God will require
[2:16:04] it
[2:16:06] amen praise the Lord that is the right
[2:16:10] way to understand the word of
[2:16:14] God hallelujah amen praise God it's an
[2:16:18] individual affair
[2:16:21] now here in the prophet says now this is
[2:16:26] not a
[2:16:28] church that building is not a
[2:16:30] church this place tomorrow it can become
[2:16:33] a
[2:16:35] bar hallelujah amen but what makes it a
[2:16:40] church is because there is a gathering
[2:16:43] of the called out
[2:16:48] on Hallelujah am you gather
[2:16:52] here that
[2:16:55] attitude that I am called by
[2:16:58] God to Ser the kingdom of
[2:17:01] God we create an atmosphere
[2:17:04] here we create the Heavenly
[2:17:08] atmosphere we feel at
[2:17:12] church amen hallelujah amen glory be to
[2:17:17] God Amen and I want to tell you if you
[2:17:20] come here
[2:17:22] with a strange
[2:17:25] atmosphere Hallelujah you can spoil the
[2:17:28] the whole
[2:17:30] thing that's why the prophet said
[2:17:33] Hallelujah if you can come with a pill
[2:17:36] of
[2:17:49] Fire e
[2:18:25] to one an
[2:18:28] individual so tonight I'm speaking to an
[2:18:32] individual I'm not speaking to to all of
[2:18:36] you I'm speaking to one
[2:18:39] person glory be to God now it's up to
[2:18:43] you position
[2:18:46] [Music]
[2:18:47] yourself in in in the right Channel
[2:18:53] hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen
[2:18:55] because I always
[2:18:57] say I always tell people you see the
[2:19:01] weddings we
[2:19:02] conduct Amen in the
[2:19:05] wedding praise the Lord amen there is a
[2:19:08] it has a group of
[2:19:11] people amen the
[2:19:15] mes best
[2:19:23] p boys the peg boys flower girls the
[2:19:26] flower girls and even
[2:19:34] Theo
[2:19:37] Lord amen they are all in the same
[2:19:41] what praise the Lord but that wedding is
[2:19:45] not for all of
[2:19:47] them it is for the two people
[2:19:51] it is a day of two
[2:19:53] people the
[2:19:56] groom and the bride so when it comes to
[2:20:00] to
[2:20:02] loocking we are not going to call the
[2:20:04] all
[2:20:05] in we are going to call only two
[2:20:09] people the
[2:20:11] bride and the
[2:20:13] groom praise but these ones are all
[2:20:18] escorts it's the same thing
[2:20:21] it depicts our
[2:20:24] journey some people put their
[2:20:28] focus upon the
[2:20:30] mat upon the Grooms
[2:20:32] men upon the flower
[2:20:35] girls and they never put their
[2:20:38] focus upon the groom and the
[2:20:42] bride praise the
[2:20:44] Lord hallelujah that's why the Bible
[2:20:47] says 2 million came out of Egypt
[2:20:52] but only two married to the
[2:20:56] prom what is that one in a
[2:21:01] million yes sir so the Bible is
[2:21:03] addressing to one
[2:21:06] person to an
[2:21:08] individual I pray that you you you make
[2:21:11] your you you you you you become that one
[2:21:15] person amen amen glory be to God amen

[2:22:27] overcame and I'm set down in with my
[2:22:30] father in his
[2:22:36] throne that is the reward of the
[2:22:43] edge that is the reward of the Overcomer
[2:22:47] in this last age
[2:22:54] in every
[2:22:55] age God has promised a
[2:23:00] reward but I've been looking through
[2:23:03] those
[2:23:05] rewards and have not seen the greatest
[2:23:11] reward that he has given us in this last
[2:23:16] age do you know that it is the greatest
[2:23:22] do you know that it is the greatest
[2:23:27] reward of all
[2:23:31] ages and I was
[2:23:34] wondering why did
[2:23:36] God from such a great
[2:23:41] reward to the last
[2:23:44] age hallelujah amen because if you look
[2:23:47] at the age of Paul

[2:25:56] age it is the age which is
[2:25:59] rewarded with the greatest
[2:26:03] reward to sit with the

[2:40:48] here
[2:40:50] but when we come
[2:40:51] here we are here for one specific
[2:40:57] purpose are you here for that one
[2:40:59] specific
[2:41:01] purpose this is the house of
[2:41:06] collection this is the
[2:41:10] throne this is the Throne of
[2:41:13] God and judgment gospels from the house
[2:41:17] of God
[2:41:22] and here is where we come
[2:41:26] together Gather in
[2:41:28] [Music]
[2:41:29] love with one
[2:41:32] another as only Christians can
[2:41:37] love but in
[2:41:40] here we are under the leadership of the
[2:41:43] spirit of the Holy
[2:41:46] Spirit the Holy Ghost is a man
[2:41:51] us and we are
[2:41:53] here to take recording among
[2:41:59] us to see where our short places
[2:42:06] are praise God amen hallelujah amen
[2:42:10] where our short places
[2:42:16] are our shortcoming
[2:42:21] and how can we catch from where we
[2:42:24] should
[2:42:29] be over to where we ought to be
[2:42:34] now where we
[2:42:36] are and where we ought to
[2:42:39] be and that's what that's what we
[2:42:44] study Minister study those places
[2:42:50] for their
[2:42:52] people when they see the
[2:42:54] people they
[2:42:58] lack when they begin on
[2:43:02] that that is the duty of a
[2:43:06] minister when he looks at A
[2:43:09] Flock and sees where the luck
[2:43:14] is he goes to
[2:43:16] God and seeks
[2:43:19] for
[2:43:20] inspiration Hallelujah and he brings it
[2:43:25] glory be to God hallelujah amen so and
[2:43:28] he looks for what to feed those
[2:43:33] people now
[2:43:35] soon I think that the church maybe
[2:43:39] should be taken just a little step step
[2:43:41] higher
[2:43:50] glory be to God amen amen I don't I
[2:43:54] don't plan on doing it this
[2:43:58] morning of showing the
[2:44:01] things but I
[2:44:04] think the Lord
[2:44:07] willing before we preach on these
[2:44:12] trumpets I want to bring the
[2:44:15] church just something that you should
[2:44:18] know
[2:44:21] and believe
[2:44:23] now you
[2:44:25] believe that this is the need of the
[2:44:29] hour Hallelujah am let me tell you
[2:44:33] church we must always look in the word
[2:44:36] of
[2:44:38] God and examine where we
[2:44:41] are and know where we supposed to
[2:44:46] be praise God Amen know the need of the
[2:44:52] hour praise the Lord amen and now we are
[2:44:55] speaking on this
[2:44:59] overcoming the word
[2:45:01] overcome of course you know what it
[2:45:04] means you've got to have something to
[2:45:09] overcome you've got to have
[2:45:12] something to
[2:45:15] overcome and this church agge
[2:45:19] the Holy Spirit was rebuking
[2:45:22] about atan church
[2:45:25] age as have just been through
[2:45:29] it it needed a
[2:45:33] rebuking had to be
[2:45:36] rebuked because of its IND different
[2:45:39] towards
[2:45:43] Christ it had put Christ
[2:45:46] outside in their age
[2:45:49] and Christ was on the
[2:45:52] outside trying to get back on the
[2:45:58] inside that is
[2:46:00] love after he had been put out of his
[2:46:04] his own
[2:46:06] house he was trying to come
[2:46:10] back and
[2:46:12] said that he that open the
[2:46:17] door I'll come into
[2:46:21] him the church
[2:46:23] itself in Hall had put him
[2:46:27] out now I already say
[2:46:34] this Christ getting out of the
[2:46:40] church it was not his
[2:46:45] wish hallelujah amen because the Bible
[2:46:49] tells
[2:46:50] us is walking in the midst of the seven
[2:46:55] candlesticks hallelujah amen so his wish
[2:46:59] is to be with the
[2:47:03] church but there are some
[2:47:09] circumstances that forces him out of the
[2:47:12] church
[2:47:21] praise God amen hallelujah amen are you
[2:47:25] give this
[2:47:28] example when if you want to chase a
[2:47:32] Muslim out of your house when if you
[2:47:35] want to chase a
[2:47:40] Muslim you don't have to quar with
[2:47:44] him don't waste your
[2:47:47] breath you you know what you
[2:47:50] do just go
[2:47:53] buy a
[2:47:59] qu and you display put it
[2:48:06] somewhere I want to bet
[2:48:10] you that will be the
[2:48:15] end of shake coming to your house
[2:48:20] praise
[2:48:21] God it is the same with our
[2:48:25] God God loved so much to keep in the
[2:48:30] church but there are some
[2:48:34] conditions that forced him
[2:48:40] out now you understand what I'm talking
[2:48:46] about praise the Lord amen
[2:48:50] so there are some
[2:48:54] abominables which were brought in the
[2:48:59] church and God could not bear with
[2:49:05] them and stepped
[2:49:11] out glory be to God Amen
[2:49:15] so what keeps God in the church
[2:49:21] is
[2:49:23] Holiness
[2:49:28] righteousness if you accommodate sin in
[2:49:30] the
[2:49:33] church you are telling God
[2:49:38] please leave us
[2:49:41] alone and leave us with our
[2:49:46] sin and you know what God do
[2:49:50] will not go very
[2:49:52] far will not go very
[2:49:55] far because he has that
[2:49:59] love he has that
[2:50:01] love he stands
[2:50:07] outside whoever
[2:50:14] hears he comes out of that Tommy root
[2:50:19] [Applause]
[2:50:24] and meet the
[2:50:25] Lord
[2:50:27] Lord have heard your
[2:50:29] voice
[2:50:31] now this last
[2:50:34] age it is not the
[2:50:37] edge of Jesus saves and Jesus
[2:50:43] heals
[2:50:46] no praise the Lord I believe some of you
[2:50:50] have
[2:50:50] seen the for us we go out every Sund we
[2:50:55] reach
[2:50:56] out the gospel we
[2:50:59] preach amen come out of
[2:51:03] her the gospel for
[2:51:06] today is not
[2:51:10] Miracles it's not Jesus saves and
[2:51:14] heals hallelujah amen the gospel of
[2:51:17] today
[2:51:19] come out my
[2:51:23] people Babylon Babylon is
[2:51:27] falling come
[2:51:29] out so that you should not be partakers
[2:51:32] of our
[2:51:36] sin that is the
[2:51:39] gospel for
[2:51:41] today calling out
[2:51:43] people out of
[2:51:46] denominations come and meet Christ
[2:51:49] because the system is
[2:51:51] rotten it is dead it cannot be
[2:51:56] revived God is calling out
[2:51:59] people hallelujah it is an
[2:52:09] exodus we are in the
[2:52:12] of hallelujah amen glory be to God am
[2:52:16] and even in the message Church there
[2:52:19] must be an
[2:52:21] exodus hallelujah
[2:52:27] amen to
[2:52:29] those to
[2:52:32] those who are from the
[2:52:35] denomination and they entered into the
[2:52:38] message and the message has become also
[2:52:42] something so God is calling
[2:52:45] out those he says come the
[2:52:50] come
[2:52:53] theer out
[2:52:56] of
[2:52:58] because amen amen however much we claim
[2:53:02] we are notan we are not
[2:53:05] in amen amen that's what we
[2:53:08] say hallelujah amen but when you get in
[2:53:12] the message
[2:53:13] Church you see the
[2:53:16] spirit audition
[2:53:20] dominating so God is saying come Out
[2:53:25] Come the
[2:53:30] [Applause]
[2:53:33] higher that is the
[2:53:36] rapture hallelujah amen come the
[2:53:40] higher come out of
[2:53:42] laition come out of the
[2:53:45] kindergarten come here come higher and
[2:53:49] the Bible says when I looked in
[2:53:53] heaven that is chapter four of
[2:53:56] Revelation I saw an Open
[2:54:00] Door what is the open
[2:54:03] door the Propet says Jesus
[2:54:07] Christ is that opens the door to the
[2:54:10] sheep
[2:54:13] for because I said I'm the door
[2:54:18] she
[2:54:21] fold Hallelujah am so you come out
[2:54:25] of and you go higher what do you see you
[2:54:30] see
[2:54:31] Jesus you walk with
[2:54:36] Jesus it is a time of Walking With
[2:54:40] Jesus it is a time we in the of Enoch
[2:54:48] praise the Lord amen because Enoch was
[2:54:50] the
[2:54:53] seventh from Adam to
[2:54:56] Enoch the
[2:54:58] seven but you know what en
[2:55:01] did
[2:55:04] defied the law of
[2:55:09] death why because he came out of that
[2:55:15] age he looked what as what all his
[2:55:19] papers have gone
[2:55:25] through
[2:55:31] this praise the Lord amen when it came
[2:55:34] to
[2:55:35] Enoch the
[2:55:39] seventh the bride in the seventh
[2:55:43] age hallelujah amen he said now
[2:55:48] to escape
[2:55:50] this I must go
[2:55:53] higher I must go
[2:55:56] higher Hallelujah and the Bible
[2:56:00] says walked with
[2:56:08] God Genesis
[2:56:11] 5 think from
[2:56:15] 23 had children
[2:56:19] had a
[2:56:21] wife praise the Lord amen but the Bible
[2:56:25] says Enoch walked with
[2:56:32] God praise the Lord amen and Enoch
[2:56:35] walked with
[2:56:39] God this
[2:56:41] age Des
[2:56:44] age of coming higher
[2:56:48] amen and following
[2:56:51] Jesus praise the Lord amen those who
[2:56:55] follow
[2:56:56] him there are you are going to
[2:57:04] defy def the law of
[2:57:10] death praise God
[2:57:13] Amen it nowhere
[2:57:20] decided I will
[2:57:22] walk with a prce of
[2:57:29] life when we walk with the
[2:57:33] Lord in the light of his
[2:57:37] world while Glory
[2:57:44] sh we do his good will
[2:57:49] he abides with us
[2:57:51] [Music]
[2:57:52] still and with all who will
[2:57:59] trust I love
[2:58:04] that Hallelujah so Enoch decided to walk
[2:58:07] with
[2:58:09] him in the light of his
[2:58:13] word and shed the glory
[2:58:18] he walked with
[2:58:20] God until death could not come
[2:58:25] near feared
[2:58:28] Enoch it did not fear
[2:58:31] Enoch it feared that God was
[2:58:36] with amen you you you are all aware of
[2:58:41] that
[2:58:46] nevered wherever he could go for the
[2:58:52] funeral
[2:58:58] flee Hallelujah so decided to walk with
[2:59:02] the one the of
[2:59:07] life so when death came to reach
[2:59:11] Enoch it
[2:59:13] saw the brightness of God and said no no
[2:59:17] no no no
[2:59:21] and Enoch pleased
[2:59:24] God he pleased God and the Bible
[2:59:28] says
[2:59:30] God took

[3:40:12] way the devil tries to divert
[3:40:16] if you continue with
[3:40:18] him even lose
[3:40:22] the that's what happened to
[3:40:24] Samson but
[3:40:26] Samson when he was in the prison he was
[3:40:29] always
[3:40:31] regretting this thing has put me in this
[3:40:33] [Applause]
[3:40:36] dungeon I'm supposed to kill the

[3:40:49] praise the Lord amen but the
[3:40:51] Philistines did not
[3:40:54] recognize that hair were
[3:40:57] growing samon was
[3:41:00] repenting some of you maybe you want God
[3:41:04] to put you
[3:41:06] somewhere in the
[3:41:08] corner that's when you
[3:41:10] repent but God doesn't want it that way
[3:41:15] hallelujah amen it's good you do
[3:41:18] it hallelujah amen so
[3:41:21] Samson lost the

[3:41:46] God and now you are entertaining
[3:41:53] Devils but when Samson
[3:41:57] realized
[3:42:01] samon and he was brought into the
[3:42:05] arena all the the fighters the of the
[3:42:10] Philistines they were
[3:42:12] drunk their wives are drunk
[3:42:16] there was a lot of
[3:42:23] Applause and
[3:42:25] Samson
[3:42:27] realized I was called for the
[3:42:31] purpose now see where I
[3:42:36] am hearing the uplo the laughing and
[3:42:46] of the

[3:44:55] Samson was
[3:44:58] restored and he started to
[3:45:00] push the pillar which is holding the
[3:45:03] building and his people thought is just

[3:45:45] when he was alive and the prophet said
[3:45:48] some people they don't want to be like
[3:45:52] Samson Hallelujah am they want their
[3:45:55] enemies to
