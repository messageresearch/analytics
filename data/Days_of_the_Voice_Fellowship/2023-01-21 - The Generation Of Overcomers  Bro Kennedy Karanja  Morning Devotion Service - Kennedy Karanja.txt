I want to tell you that God has yes and brother Ken is a witness that we you too can overcome these are youth meetings we are blessed to have young people speaking to us I mean so we are not doing so good on time so we'll just uh see them for us amen he touched me oh he doesn't let me something [Music] like those [Music] okay foreign [Music] [Applause] I'll pray [Music] you know we are singing for them to bring it to the now to impact on the expectation and expectations he'll touch me yeah something is going to happen I believe you're short of time leader for the songs and we just want to be an expectation this morning we just want to be under expectation this morning we thank the Lord for the special singing thank the Lord for each and everyone God bless you so much we just turned to our Bibles in the Book of Psalms chapter five I just have a little thought this morning when the pastor mentioned to me that he requested that I prepare myself for the service today it was such a huge it was had such a huge burden I would say standing here is never usually easy but I trust the Lord shall make it possible for me this morning to stand in the Gap and speak the Oracles of the Lord now the thought that I had most of it was actually preached yesterday yeah to start this morning because I was to read from Joshua chapter six in Hebrews we covered that extensively yeah but I believe there is still they still a small portion that the Lord has reserved for us this day foreign when are you going to take him out of the ocean food so forgive me if you still go through the same same scriptures but I believe being that the awards of eternal life we can never get out of them the book of Psalms chapter five the Lord has just placed something in my heart this morning and I'll just be leaning mostly on the morning side because it's a morning service uh oh Lord consider my meditation foreign and now we come to the most important part of the service where a man moves out of the way and Lord you can come and step in and speak to us as a children we're expecting dear Lord this morning you're going to do something special that you're going to touch us oh God we shall leave this place with an experience that we shall be remembering that on that morning service on 21st of January something happened in my life the Lord touched me the Lord delivered me the Lord Set Me Free the Lord healed me may you do something special this morning Father we thank you and appreciate you Lord as we get into the ministry of the word as I Sovereign myself time has really gone but I trust that the Lord is in control of everything I just want to take some time we have the theme for the meetings the generation of Overcomers blessed be the name of the Lord so even before so even before we continue I want you to even see the prophetic words God is speaking to you today it does not matter your situation it does not matter how things are here but God has already counted you among the generation of Overcomers you see something that people need to know and as Believers we need to raise up to a level where we identify with God the way he identifies with us it does not matter your presence condition look at Adam Adam Adam was the son of God but then and he came into a fallen condition now remember he was falling but though he was falling he was a fallen Son of God good day blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus we have the children of Israel they were in bondage they were in captivity regardless of whether they were in Egypt in Babylon we have a place by the Covenant of God and as long as they got in tune with that foreign [Applause] that is the reason why hence when he failed he will still find his way children of God children of God I want to tell you this morning you can find your way you can find your way back identified [Applause] there is power and identification but as long as you do not identify you will always be living defeated foreign you actually living out you are living out you are living out you are living out something that has already been written about you only naturally I don't know if you catch something about your financial you see overcoming for you now I'm speaking to someone overcoming for you is not it may sin to change it may not be in God's dictionary there is [Music] a vocabulary of God in the vocabulary of God there is no difference [Music] because he himself he over kept sins [Applause] it's not it's not that life nowadays is so difficult see what came fast what came first church if you answer that question you
