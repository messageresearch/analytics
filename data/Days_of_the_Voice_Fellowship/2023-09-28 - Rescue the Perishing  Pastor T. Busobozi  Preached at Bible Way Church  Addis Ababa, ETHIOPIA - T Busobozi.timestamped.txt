[2:56] and Jesus answering said a certain man
[2:58] went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and
[3:01] fell among Thieves which stripped him of
[3:03] his reignment and wounded him and
[3:05] departed leaving him half dead yes
[3:20] and by chance there came down a certain
[3:23] priest that way and when he saw him he
[3:26] passed by on the other side and likewise
[3:29] I lever it when he was at the place came
[3:32] and looked on and passed by on the other
[3:35] side but a certain Samaritan as a Janet
[3:38] came where he was and when he saw him he
[3:42] had compassion on him and went to him
[3:44] and bound up his wounds powering in oil
[3:47] and wine and set him on his own beast
[3:50] and bought him brought him rather to one
[3:53] in and took care of him
[3:56] and on the morrow when he departed he
[3:58] took out two pence and gave them to the
[4:01] coast and said unto him take care of him
[4:04] and whatsoever thou spendeth more when I
[4:07] come again I will repay thee which now
[4:10] of these three thinkers thou
[4:13] was the neighbor unto him that fell
[4:16] among the thieves and he said he said he
[4:20] that he showed he that showed Mercy on
[4:22] him
[4:24] then say to Jesus unto him go and do
[4:27] thou likewise

[5:48] [Music]
[6:26] that a people each of them is trying to
[6:29] do something

[6:36] organizations

[6:42] what other organizations we have very
[6:43] many organizations
[6:45] that are trying to help the needy yeah
[6:49] trying to rescue the orphans

[6:56] infamine
[6:58] against many organizations

[7:05] needs

[8:25] God is interested
[8:28] foreign are you hearing me yes how much
[8:31] you know tell your neighbor God is
[8:33] entrusted in you
[8:36] because we are souls
[8:41] for God next job you should be able to
[8:44] rescue Souls
[8:46] children what do you think that he has
[8:48] done many other games you know people
[8:51] have their many programs
[8:53] people have started churches
[8:57] people have started organizations
[9:00] and they are saying they are rescuing
[9:03] souls
[9:09] and they are all saying they're rescuing
[9:11] Souls
[9:12] [Music]
[9:14] they are helping the people to live
[9:17] religiously
[9:20] the Bible in the Book of Amos
[9:28] Hallelujah he says foreign
[9:45] are you hearing yes how much you know if
[9:47] you're hearing me say Amen then I know
[9:48] you are here
[9:50] if you're not understanding what I'm
[9:52] talking about very soon you'll
[9:53] understand
[9:57] it's not going to to start an
[10:00] organization
[10:03] is not going to start a hospital
[10:05] hospital
[10:10] to rescue Souls
[10:12] God is going to do nothing but he will
[10:16] send a prophet
[10:19] he will send a prophet with a message
[10:28] the souls that are lost
[10:31] so I'm here today
[10:42] that is what this church stands foreign
[11:59] as long as they don't receive the whole
[12:01] world
[12:05] as long as they teach things
[12:09] there are just traditions of men
[12:12] there are ideas of men yes
[12:16] doctrines
[12:18] they are still living in sins
[12:22] but God has sent a message
[12:26] not only in Ethiopia all over the world
[12:30] [Music]
[12:41] you are seeing all the filthy things
[12:45] are coming from the developed world
[12:49] coming from Europe and America
[12:52] but make no mistake even in those
[12:56] countries
[12:57] God must rescue the souls
[13:00] God is going to rescue them from
[13:03] everyone
[13:04] and when it comes to Ethiopia God is
[13:08] going to rescue them to every area
[13:13] not only at this
[13:28] even from foreign
[13:51] Amen in the message the power of
[13:53] decision let me just lay this foundation
[13:55] for you here yes
[13:58] God had rained down Manna Out of Heaven
[14:03] that's a very beautiful type of Christ
[14:05] coming down from heaven to die on Earth
[14:07] crystals
[14:10] to perish on Earth
[14:13] Jesus came to perish on Earth
[14:17] that he might rescue the perishing
[15:08] but because of time let me go to this
[15:10] man here okay he was coming from
[15:12] Jerusalem
[15:16] to Jericho whether yarico in the story
[15:19] which we have read
[15:21] and you know he was coming from
[15:23] Jerusalem to Jericho okay
[15:26] so that's a bad place to work this is a
[15:29] bad road to work but um
[15:32] I wish she was coming from Jericho to
[15:34] Jerusalem
[15:37] was the city of God
[15:41] where God had his house
[15:44] where are you it was the right place to
[15:46] go
[15:48] where the word of God is
[15:50] the right place for us to go
[15:54] when you teach baptism in the name of
[15:57] our Lord Jesus Christ
[16:05] foreign
[16:16] on
[16:27] [Music]
[17:26] [Music]
[17:39] they left him almost half dead foreign
[17:50] this is what the denominations have done
[17:53] I want yeah
[17:57] the people so much desire God
[18:01] someone like I don't know whether it is
[18:04] here but I believe it is because I have
[18:05] spoken to a few people someone comes to
[18:07] a pastor and the owners are Pastor I'm
[18:10] going through this problem
[18:16] I have a solution for you
[18:19] by anointing oil
[18:23] foreign
[18:47] foreign
[19:36] blessing
[20:01] [Applause]
[20:06] is that what is that Amen to know that
[20:10] souls are perishing
[20:13] and they are in those churches
[20:16] [Music]
[20:18] the Bible says Saturn has become has
[20:22] made himself an angel of Light
[20:26] and because of that he has preachers
[20:35] to be preachers of righteousness
[20:42] on behalf of God
[20:44] but when the people Baka they are being
[20:48] battered liquor
[20:51] instead of going to Jerusalem they are
[20:53] very busy going to Jericho
[20:57] and I can tell you that many people like
[21:00] that
[21:01] our generation
[21:06] don't know where the truth is
[21:23] foreign
[21:28] but they never heard of this person
[21:32] no religion is going to help the people
[21:34] yes
[21:50] we are introducing you to Jesus
[21:59] that will rescue your soul
[22:02] that will bring you to something that
[22:04] can change your soul
[22:08] and fill you with the Holy ghosts
[22:15] and make you go out and do the same God
[22:19] praise God yeah so this man fell to the
[22:23] city
[22:27] and Jesus spoke and said
[22:30] foreign
[22:36] then Jesus said unto them again very
[22:38] very same to you I am the door to the
[22:40] Sheep
[22:41] all that ever came before me a thieves
[22:44] and robbers
[22:45] but a sheep did not hear them
[23:00] I'm burning up with Revelation right now

[23:09] myself
[23:18] and as I was studying the Bible
[23:21] I was reading the whole Bible
[23:31] I got questions about my religions
[23:36] ask the questions

[23:52] but in my soul I was yearning for more
[23:56] truths
[23:59] my soul was I was perishing I never said
[24:02] yeah I needed something to rescue me
[24:07] and one day
[24:09] hallelujah hallelujah one day and again

[24:15] Prophets
[24:20] The Bible that Bible teachings
[24:26] with a message of restoration

[26:33] they are robbing people is
[26:48] it will have the life of Jesus following
[26:51] it yes
[26:54] and not only the life he were to return

[28:15] yeah man like your pastor wanted to be
[28:18] wanted to be a politician level
[28:22] you wanted to be the Prime Minister
[28:25] he has what it takes
[28:28] but one day she met him
[28:32] he met the word
[28:36] ambition
[28:40] his ambition was
[28:43] to kill every believer
[28:49] to imprison them
[28:53] that was his ambition
[28:56] one day
[28:58] and again
[29:03] what did he
[29:05] meets the pillar of fire yes
[29:08] the same that was with Moses
[29:14] with the children of Israel in the in
[29:16] the deserts
[29:24] foreign
[29:42] and the voice told him
[29:44] I am who I am
[29:49] but poor soul
[29:51] met the same Pillar of Fire yeah
[29:57] and he said I remember Moses
[30:01] Moses asked the same questions
[30:05] now God has visited me and I'm doing his
[30:09] work
[30:10] by killing the Christians
[30:13] I want him to introduce himself to me
[30:17] who are you my lord yes Jesus
[30:26] I don't know
[30:30] of the Old Testament
[30:33] is the Jesus
[30:39] Jesus is Lord yes
[30:42] that is why we say
[30:45] Jesus is Lord Jesus
[30:54] Jehovah means God is our Salvation
[30:59] Jesus means God is our salvation
[31:05] foreign
[31:06] [Music]
[31:57] honestly it doesn't matter what you
[32:01] think in your mind
[32:02] the word says my way is not your way
[32:10] some of you who are questioning this
[32:12] message right now
[32:19] okay but let me tell you a little more
[32:21] the mistake you have done yesterday is
[32:25] to come here
[32:26] because you are hearing the word
[32:29] the word is a seat yes
[32:39] [Music]
[32:52] foreign
[33:14] did you hear that did they hear that
[33:18] tell your neighbors saves and robots
[33:25] I want you to preach with me so you
[33:28] don't dance
[33:34] we are repeating the words of Jesus
[33:43] we are thieves
[33:45] foreign
[33:55] but the Sheep
[33:58] did not hear them
[34:01] I believe I am a ship
[34:06] coming that's why when we hear the word
[34:08] of God
[34:10] we bleed like a ship
[34:22] no no but if you were God
[34:25] when the world comes
[34:30] [Music]
[34:37] but thank God all of you asleep
[34:46] and he said the Sheep did not hear the
[34:49] thieves and robbers
[34:53] he says I am the door anybody
[34:56] If any man enters
[34:59] he shall be saved
[35:22] because of receiving this message
[35:25] I want to tell you
[35:27] foreign
[35:52] the reason why I stand come on pastors
[35:55] why I stand behind my pastor capacity is
[36:00] because
[36:02] yes Hallelujah because of this thing
[36:04] here
[36:07] he's preaching the world
[36:10] I am not following him because he's very
[36:12] handsome
[36:14] I am not following him because he speaks
[36:17] very well
[36:18] I am not following him because he has
[36:21] good money a lot of money
[36:23] so if you are here because your past is
[36:26] helping you sorry Pastor
[36:30] you must follow your pastor Pastor you
[36:34] must accept his leadership
[36:36] because he is preaching to you the one
[36:41] I thank God for a god-cold man
[36:45] be comfortably behind us
[36:50] knowing is not leading me to himself
[37:23] that can help
[37:25] and scratch them
[37:27] um
[37:35] what are those pastors
[37:38] when you bring the word
[37:41] the people who does
[37:45] so the pasta is very good
[37:55] answer today
[37:59] [Music]
[38:03] laughs
[38:04] I speak prophecy
[38:06] they even ask these days
[38:09] do you want to hear from above or from
[38:13] the world
[38:16] my above is
[38:22] if you bring your above which is not
[38:25] here
[38:27] that one belongs to hell yeah
[38:31] and any good cold man
[38:35] we lead His People
[38:39] based on the world
[38:44] why we have a message
[38:47] he's saying come out of there my people
[38:50] this is
[38:54] those who are only giving us
[39:06] foreign
[40:09] it has been sent for foreign
[40:24] [Applause]
[40:52] hallelujah amen we must come out of them
[40:56] those who wait for prophecy so that they
[40:59] can shout
[41:02] those who wait for presumptuous talk so
[41:05] they can dance
[41:09] oh my God oh my God
[41:12] praise God
[41:16] let me skip this
[41:18] he that laid down his life is the real
[41:20] Shepherd
[41:22] foreign
[41:59] that's a life without God
[42:02] foreign
[42:13] [Music]
[42:38] the reason why I believe this message
[42:41] and began running with it
[42:45] at 15 years
[42:47] because
[44:18] you see this man was stripped
[44:21] of all his rement
[44:24] the book in the Bible the Book of
[44:26] Revelation 3.
[44:30] because you say laodice
[44:35] they're saying we are rich I'm rich
[44:39] with the goods and have need of Nothing
[44:42] But The Generation says
[44:47] Michigan
[44:56] yes
[44:59] he was naked the denominations and the
[45:04] system of this generation
[45:07] the demons
[45:10] they have come to
[45:15] Stripes both spiritually and physically
[45:22] the physical type is the spirituality
[45:27] if you want to know whether a church is
[45:33] look at the women in that church
[45:39] the one who is saying is a pastor's wife
[45:48] she can't even work well
[45:52] [Music]
[45:55] and then those long high heels
[46:11] and then she begins working with our
[46:13] nails
[46:15] all painted red button
[46:19] and she works on the pulpit and Nanda is
[46:23] the pastor's wife
[46:31] so she comes
[46:38] this is it
[46:41] the Bible says
[46:43] naked and they don't know
[46:48] the devil has removed the clothes from
[46:50] the women of Our Generation
[46:56] they have a form of godliness
[47:03] to change them
[47:05] the power that changes with them is the
[47:08] word yeah
[47:11] but they have refused where the word
[47:14] says
[47:16] a woman said must dress in mother's
[47:19] apparently
[47:22] Christ
[47:27] man cover your body
[47:32] so cover your body a woman say touch
[47:35] lips
[47:38] is the devil who has removed the clothes
[47:43] but thank God for the counselves
[48:07] that you may be close
[48:11] why are our sisters dressed properly
[48:15] why did you throw away makeup
[48:18] because when you saw in the world
[48:23] you realize you're beautiful
[48:27] foreign
[48:35] so when you see yourself in the middle
[48:36] sister
[48:38] you see the beauty that God gave you
[48:40] exactly
[48:42] I don't need makeup make a password
[48:46] when you look at your ears in the mirror
[48:49] status
[48:53] you don't need to be targeted like a cow
[48:55] look in the buddy
[48:59] when you see yourself in the mirror
[49:03] you realize your body is sacred sourness
[49:17] that comes by an entire message
[49:23] praise God
[49:27] amen praise God hallelujah I was going
