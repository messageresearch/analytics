[1:30:26] uh perhaps maybe we can have one of the
[1:30:29] ministers.
[1:30:32] God has blessed DVF with good ministers.
[1:30:36] We appreciate God for that.
[1:30:39] Amen. And so yesterday we were at the
[1:30:41] wedding uh ceremony of brother
[1:30:44] brother
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Joseph
[1:30:48] who I believe is on his people are
[1:30:50] checking where he
[1:30:54] certainly you don't expect him to be
[1:30:55] there
[1:30:57] unless he's a man of real faith.
[1:31:00] I'm not saying he doesn't have reason
[1:31:03] but myself and my wife we were we came
[1:31:05] to church.
[1:31:08] We understand if someone doesn't
[1:31:12] you're tired after all the ceremony
[1:31:16] brother Joseph wanted to thank God for
[1:31:18] his ceremony because
[1:31:21] man did not give me a lot of headache.
[1:31:24] He took responsibility
[1:31:27] for his function and did and did most
[1:31:31] much much of the planning
[1:31:35] much of the planning really
[1:31:38] at the end. We're just all along just
[1:31:40] going to see how guiding to see how
[1:31:45] and so thank you to those who came
[1:31:48] and I know many did not come
[1:31:51] but many some came from
[1:31:55] But I wanted to tell you this.
[1:31:58] Even if you're not invited to go to the
[1:32:00] reception,
[1:32:04] if you're a part of the church
[1:32:08] and a young man or young lady here is
[1:32:10] married,
[1:32:13] regardless, please come at least and be
[1:32:16] in the church.
[1:32:18] That alone is encouraging
[1:32:21] to him.
[1:32:25] You know on weddings we usually have a
[1:32:27] lot of new people that come
[1:32:30] really a lot of new people that
[1:32:33] you have family the families of the boys
[1:32:37] friends
[1:32:38] these people are not believers
[1:32:41] an opportunity to as a church to reach
[1:32:44] out to them. I gave you the testimony
[1:32:47] last Sunday. Brother Hapto now who is um
[1:32:50] you know you know ministering and is in
[1:32:53] Canada now one of those that believed in
[1:32:55] the first years in Ethiopia
[1:33:00] received the message because his friend
[1:33:02] invited him
[1:33:06] during his engagement
[1:33:09] and then by the time he was coming for
[1:33:10] the wedding to be the best man he was
[1:33:14] already a believer.
[1:33:17] baptized. So what I I wanted to
[1:33:20] encourage you friends,
[1:33:22] you are expected to be here when we have
[1:33:24] a wedding.
[1:33:27] You if you're not invited to the
[1:33:29] reception,
[1:33:31] you are free to go home
[1:33:34] after that.
[1:33:36] But but uh I would encourage you to
[1:33:39] please always come on the wedding
[1:33:40] ceremonies.
[1:33:43] Is that a man church?
[1:33:46] God bless you if you
[1:33:49] things went very well
[1:33:51] and uh we thank God for that. Sister
[1:33:54] Mariam and his pastors were here.
[1:33:58] They told me they always stream our
[1:34:00] services.
[1:34:03] We thank God for uh for them and
[1:34:08] and for what they doing there.
[1:34:12] Amen. Amen. Also,
[1:34:15] I wanted to mention that pastor Joshua
[1:34:18] is here.
[1:34:21] Please stand.
[1:34:24] Pastor Joshua is
[1:34:26] a young man
[1:34:30] that has um you know he came and met me
[1:34:32] some years ago. How many years ago is
[1:34:36] that?
[1:34:39] &gt;&gt; Three years
[1:34:41] is when we we first met.
[1:34:44] you can be seated. And he he had he came
[1:34:47] and told me that he had a burden.
[1:34:50] And this burden was to go to uh back to
[1:34:52] his home place.
[1:34:55] And God, the Holy Spirit specifically
[1:34:57] gave him this uh the name of a town
[1:35:00] where he should go
[1:35:04] and evangelize.
[1:35:06] And so he obeyed without having any
[1:35:09] money, without having knowing what to
[1:35:12] do. who you were determined.
[1:35:14] But you see, he obeyed
[1:35:18] and he went. Don't you think that is
[1:35:20] wonderful?
[1:35:22] That's really wonderful. So, we've uh
[1:35:25] tried to stand with him.
[1:35:28] We will see what the Lord has in the
[1:35:29] store in the future.
[1:35:32] I've been even there to see what he's
[1:35:33] doing. And uh
[1:35:36] this week I have been very busy.
[1:35:40] uh you know as you know that uh when I
[1:35:42] returned from the trip
[1:35:45] I did not rest well. I believe you know
[1:35:48] when I came back friends I came back
[1:35:49] with a heavy burden
[1:35:53] that I have to do all I have to do
[1:35:58] while I have the grace and the chance
[1:36:00] the opportunity
[1:36:03] to do it for the Lord.
[1:36:05] And so I I mean I saw I saw especially I
[1:36:09] was so impacted
[1:36:11] you know when I was at Clo
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; and I was taken in this room
[1:36:16] and I saw a lot of tapesh
[1:36:21] that brother Ed had preached over the
[1:36:23] years.
[1:36:25] But I also saw, you know, just to see
[1:36:28] and see the years that did back and how
[1:36:31] much this one man and with many standing
[1:36:34] with him that he had accomplished for
[1:36:35] the Lord
[1:36:39] and how much impact his ministry had all
[1:36:43] over the world.
[1:36:47] So I came you know with a zeal to do
[1:36:49] more for them.
[1:36:52] So that's why I did not rest.
[1:36:56] I immediately went to uh West Nile.
[1:37:00] I was here on Sunday.
[1:37:02] Um still struggling with jet lag.
[1:37:09] So then I on Tuesday did I travel on
[1:37:11] Wednesday? On Tuesday?
[1:37:14] Yeah, on Tuesday on Tuesday we went to
[1:37:18] on Monday we were trying to purchase
[1:37:20] some computers
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; that we would u and then on Tuesday.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; I was in touch with the pastors there
[1:37:30] and they had they had already been
[1:37:31] trying to look around to see the people
[1:37:33] that fit the qual that would propose and
[1:37:36] think that they are able to do the work
[1:37:38] of translation.
[1:37:43] So they brought me about how many were
[1:37:45] there?
[1:37:50] 14. Yeah. So we we spent time with I
[1:37:54] needed only four.
[1:37:56] So we spent time with them and uh you
[1:38:00] know to to what you would want to call
[1:38:02] it maybe an interview or something
[1:38:07] you know to check how how's the computer
[1:38:08] skills
[1:38:11] how is the knowledge of the message
[1:38:14] studying of scriptures and
[1:38:17] you know how how much they can be able
[1:38:19] to do. So, we were able to get the
[1:38:23] number we needed.
[1:38:26] And then in the middle of it all,
[1:38:29] the Holy Spirit reminded me of Brother
[1:38:31] Joshua.
[1:38:34] Um, I remembered that he had told me
[1:38:36] that he was already I remembered the
[1:38:40] Holy Spirit just brought it back to me.
[1:38:42] We had just had a light moment and he
[1:38:44] told me he had told me that he was
[1:38:46] already starting to do translation on
[1:38:48] his own.
[1:38:53] and uh but he could not be able to
[1:38:55] continue because of you know many
[1:38:57] reasons.
[1:38:59] He was trying because he wanted to get
[1:39:00] the message into his life
[1:39:02] to his own people and so I called him
[1:39:06] immediately and well long story short
[1:39:09] he's one of the the team
[1:39:12] one of that team that is going to
[1:39:13] translate.
[1:39:15] Amen. And uh he's also a pastor in that
[1:39:17] town now.
[1:39:20] How many believers do you do you have?
[1:39:24] Yes. From nothing
[1:39:29] now to 15.
[1:39:31] I think that is a that is the hand of
[1:39:32] God. and he has not even been cons like
[1:39:34] very busy there because he had to also
[1:39:36] look for a living and you know
[1:39:40] I'M ALWAYS ON FIRE WHEN I SEE another
[1:39:43] fellow younger man
[1:39:46] on fire for
[1:39:48] I used to call myself the youngest
[1:39:49] preacher in the message
[1:39:52] but these days I also have others I can
[1:39:53] call younger men
[1:39:56] it means that time is really rushing
[1:39:59] you may think you are young but time is
[1:40:02] going. So do what you have to do for the
[1:40:05] Lord
[1:40:07] while you can do it because the the the
[1:40:10] you know the evening the end of the end
[1:40:13] of time is just closing on us.
[1:40:17] Amen. We appreciate you brother Joshua
[1:40:18] and what you are doing for the Lord.
[1:40:21] We will have you come and minister to us
[1:40:23] one time.
[1:40:25] Amen.
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; Well, are you happy this morning?
[1:40:30] Amen. We
[1:40:31] uh we are going to have this next
[1:40:33] Saturday
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; the ceremony of brother uh Enoch.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Uh it's not going to be the wedding
[1:40:41] ceremony on this Saturday.
[1:40:44] It's going to be the introduction
[1:40:48] introduction, right?
[1:40:51] Yeah. At his um fiance's home.
[1:40:56] So you remember him in prayer.
[1:41:00] He still is in much need.
[1:41:03] But uh this is not a wedding. It's just
[1:41:05] introduction ceremony.
[1:41:08] Let's pray for him that all go well.
[1:41:11] And lastly also remember to pray uh
[1:41:15] on the third week of uh weekend of
[1:41:17] December.
[1:41:20] I've been invited to Kamoja for a
[1:41:21] convention major convention.
[1:41:25] These people are usually in thousands.
[1:41:28] We need to remember those meetings.
[1:41:31] Shall we stand and we go into the word?
[1:41:35] I know also brother Julius has been
[1:41:36] invited
[1:41:39] in one of the you know this some of the
[1:41:41] brothers called me and they said
[1:41:44] to have him go and support in the in the
[1:41:46] meetings some youth
[1:41:50] some deaths in December I think.
[1:41:54] So we are happy to pray for him and
[1:41:56] stand behind.
[1:41:59] So we are going to the book of Amos
[1:42:01] chapter 3.
[1:42:06] This morning
[1:42:09] I was at uh with a group of seven.
[1:42:14] We went to St. Henry's College
[1:42:16] Henry's
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; and we had a very good service there
[1:42:21] and uh
[1:42:23] one soul gave their heart to God.
[1:42:28] And I believe God will give us grace
[1:42:31] there because the the the director said
[1:42:33] he will invite us more and more.
[1:42:37] They're not even believers of the
[1:42:38] message.
[1:42:40] But uh you know
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; it means that praise and noble have had
[1:42:45] a good testimony
[1:42:49] because they have influenced the
[1:42:50] administration
[1:42:53] to invite us.
[1:42:57] If you are a student
[1:43:00] always do something at your school.
[1:43:04] God has sent you there as an ambassador.
[1:43:08] Amen. Amen.
[1:43:10] So we are reading Amos 3:7
[1:43:16] and we will be seated after that.
[1:43:21] Can we read it together?
[1:43:24] We Okay, we have it on the screen so you
[1:43:26] can look up here and let us read it
[1:43:28] together.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:43:34] he revealth his secret unto his
[1:43:37] servants, the prophets. Amen. You may be
[1:43:40] seated.
[1:43:53] I have it doesn't necessarily mean that
[1:43:55] I'm going to speak for long, but I have
[1:43:57] a lot to say this morning
[1:44:02] uh that the Holy Spirit has laid on my
[1:44:04] heart.
[1:44:06] I had to leave the wedding uh a little
[1:44:08] early yesterday.
[1:44:11] I was having this burden but I did not
[1:44:13] know exactly how to approach this
[1:44:14] subject.
[1:44:17] So I needed to you know spend time in
[1:44:20] the presence of God.
[1:44:23] And so I had one hour to rest in the
[1:44:26] night
[1:44:27] and I had to wake up early to go to the
[1:44:29] school.
[1:44:31] So when we came back, I rested another
[1:44:32] one now
[1:44:34] to be here this morning. And I just I'm
[1:44:38] feeling, you know, I'm feeling good and
[1:44:40] I hope that you're feeling good also
[1:44:43] believing that the Holy Spirit will
[1:44:44] minister to us.
[1:44:47] And um today I just want to deal with a
[1:44:50] subject of political maneuvers that
[1:44:54] obscure the vision.
[1:45:03] Amen.
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; I don't know if my pronunciation of
[1:45:06] obscure obscar is is perfect. I don't
[1:45:09] know. But
[1:45:12] the word there means hinder.
[1:45:17] Political maneuvers.
[1:45:21] I'm I'm praying and I'm requesting you
[1:45:23] church
[1:45:24] to give me your undivided attention.
[1:45:29] Let us let us be shut in with God
[1:45:33] and avoid movements.
[1:45:37] And if possible, you switch off your
[1:45:38] phone
[1:45:40] or put it in silence. Check it. If
[1:45:42] you're not sure, check it now so you
[1:45:44] don't get interrupted.
[1:45:50] Mine was not in silence.
[1:45:53] So, check your phone as well and be
[1:45:56] sure. so that you're not interrupted.
[1:46:00] Praise the Lord. Ask your neighbor, are
[1:46:02] you ready for this?
[1:46:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God.
[1:46:10] I said, praise God.
[1:46:13] Amen. Now, I'm talking about a vision
[1:46:17] and then political maneuvers.
[1:46:20] You see, God always has
[1:46:25] the vision for the church.
[1:46:28] And when I say the church, I not only
[1:46:31] refer to the New Testament body of
[1:46:33] believers,
[1:46:37] I not only talk about that.
[1:46:39] However, I am also referring to his
[1:46:41] people
[1:46:43] at every season,
[1:46:48] every generation.
[1:46:50] every time in history.
[1:46:53] We can even bring it down and say every
[1:46:54] city, every location, every place,
[1:46:59] including here in
[1:47:01] you see God has a vision
[1:47:05] and we can also put it now in times
[1:47:08] and say, you know, the time we are
[1:47:10] living in,
[1:47:12] you know, God always has a a vision.
[1:47:17] YOU SEE, BEFORE HE DOES anything major,
[1:47:20] he always sends his man
[1:47:24] that he would anoint
[1:47:27] a man that he would sanction.
[1:47:30] A man that HE WOULD USE TO CARRY OUT a
[1:47:34] mission,
[1:47:36] a mission that would fulfill the vision
[1:47:38] God has for his people.
[1:47:45] You understand what I'm saying? There
[1:47:47] are great men that have come and gone.
[1:47:52] But you see, the vision of God must
[1:47:56] always be accomplished.
[1:48:00] You see, we need leaders.
[1:48:03] God always gives us leaders
[1:48:06] both in politics and spiritually and
[1:48:09] physically, naturally.
[1:48:12] We all have leaders. We need to be led.
[1:48:16] If you WANT TO GET ANYWHERE,
[1:48:18] YOU ALWAYS have to accept to be led.
[1:48:22] Okay? But if you don't acknowledge,
[1:48:28] the leadership OF GOD
[1:48:31] FOR your season,
[1:48:34] for your life,
[1:48:36] then you are set UP FOR FAILURE.
[1:48:39] SO WE DON'T always see you know like God
[1:48:44] he has from generations
[1:48:47] before us always sent men
[1:48:52] but we ARE NOT FIT
[1:48:55] according to people's judgment.
[1:48:59] You remember the scripture we READ IT
[1:49:01] SAYS GOD WILL do nothing.
[1:49:05] HE WILL DO NOTHING. IF YOU WANT GOD TO
[1:49:07] DO SOMETHING,
[1:49:09] HE HAS TO SEND A MAN. He has TO SEND A
[1:49:12] PROPHET. IF HE DOESN'T SEND A PROPHET,
[1:49:15] HE WILL DO NOTHING. AND I TELL THOSE
[1:49:17] PEOPLE WHO ARE OFFENDED by the prophet
[1:49:19] of this house,
[1:49:21] A MAJOR PROPHET, GOD HAS SENT TO OUR
[1:49:24] GENERATION
[1:49:26] AND THEY ARE OFFENDED AT IT, THEN THEY
[1:49:28] GOD WILL DO NOTHING FOR THEM.
[1:49:32] BUT TO THOSE OF YOU WHO RECEIVE THE
[1:49:34] PROPHET GOD SENDS FOR OUR SEASON FOR OUR
[1:49:38] GENERATION, GOD WILL DO EVERYTHING FOR
[1:49:40] YOU.
[1:49:43] WE DON'T ALWAYS SEE LIKE GOD
[1:49:47] FROM GENERATIONS
[1:49:49] BEFORE US AND YOU HAS ALWAYS SENT MEN.
[1:49:53] BUT THIS MAN ACCORDING to people's
[1:49:55] JUDGMENTS
[1:49:58] ARE ALWAYS NOT FIT.
[1:50:00] In the DAYS OF THE FLOOD,
[1:50:03] HE SENT NOAH, a man that was old, a man
[1:50:07] that probably was A DRUNKARD,
[1:50:11] A MAN WHO WAS NOT WORTHY,
[1:50:13] MAYBE HAD NO DIFFERENCE WITH HIM, BUT
[1:50:16] THE BIBLE SAYS NOAH FOUND GRACE
[1:50:20] IN THE SIGHT OF GOD. SO, IT WASN'T THAT
[1:50:23] NOAH WAS BETTER THAN THEM.
[1:50:26] GOD CHOSE HIM AND GOD SENT HIM BECAUSE
[1:50:29] HE WAS THE MAN THAT GOD HAD CHOSEN
[1:50:34] TO USE AT THAT HOUR.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN. And you know when GOD CHOOSES A
[1:50:39] MAN, HE ALWAYS HAS A WAY,
[1:50:43] HE ALSO TAKES from his home and family.
[1:50:48] No, when he chooses a man
[1:50:51] on that line of the calling,
[1:50:54] he also chooses his family.
[1:50:59] Did you know that?
[1:51:01] I want you to THINK ABOUT IT. GOD SENDS
[1:51:04] A PROPHET TO THE WHOLE WORLD. ONE
[1:51:07] PROPHET to the whole world. In that
[1:51:10] time, it was perhaps more developed than
[1:51:13] this,
[1:51:14] more civilized.
[1:51:17] But God chose one man to the whole WORLD
[1:51:21] AND HIS MESSAGE WAS THE ONLY MESSAGE WAS
[1:51:24] THE ONLY MESSAGE THAT CAME FROM GOD.
[1:51:28] IF NOAH DIDN'T SPEAK,
[1:51:31] GOD DIDN'T SPEAK. IF NOAH DIDN'T COME,
[1:51:35] GOD WOULD DO NOTHING.
[1:51:38] AND HIS MESSAGE WAS REFUSED BY THE WHOLE
[1:51:41] WORLD.
[1:51:44] WAS REJECTED BY THE WHOLE WORLD.
[1:51:47] BUT THAT DID NOT HINDER GOD.
[1:51:50] UNBELIEF CANNOT HINDER GOD.
[1:51:54] IF NO ONE BELIEVES THE MESSAGE,
[1:51:57] THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEBODY, [screaming]
[1:51:59] SOMEBODY SOMEWHERE
[1:52:02] THAT GOD HAS ORDAINED
[1:52:04] TO RECEIVE THAT MESSAGE.
[1:52:06] IF GOD SENDS A MAN, THERE IS SOMEONE
[1:52:09] SOMEWHERE [screaming]
[1:52:11] THAT WILL BELIEVE IN THAT MINISTRY, THAT
[1:52:13] WILL RECEIVE THAT MINISTRY.
[1:52:16] AND THAT MAN, YOU SEE, Noah walked with
[1:52:20] GOD AND HE DID WHAT GOD TOLD HIM TO DO.
[1:52:23] THINK ABOUT IT. Only eight people
[1:52:28] were saved at that time. Who are they?
[1:52:31] All family members
[1:52:34] of the house of Noah.
[1:52:38] Have you thought about it?
[1:52:41] Now ask yourself a question. How come
[1:52:44] you send a message to the whole world
[1:52:48] and only one family would feel safe?
[1:52:52] Why didn't he just kill everybody and
[1:52:53] save that family?
[1:52:58] Because people have a choice.
[1:53:02] WHEN GOD SENDS YOU A A MAN,
[1:53:05] YOU HAVE A CHOICE, BELIEVE HIM and that
[1:53:08] man will HELP YOU. BUT IF YOU DON'T
[1:53:10] BELIEVE THAT MAN, THAT MAN CANNOT HELP
[1:53:13] YOU.
[1:53:14] EVEN IF HE'S ANOINTED
[1:53:17] WITH A FLOWING ANOINTING, THAT MAN
[1:53:19] CANNOT HELP YOU.
[1:53:22] You know, brother, I'm saying, YOU KNOW,
[1:53:24] I'VE SEEN PEOPLE AND TALK ABOUT THEIR
[1:53:25] PASTOR, RIDICULE HIM, AND DO ALL SORTS
[1:53:27] OF THINGS.
[1:53:29] HOW CAN THAT MAN EVER HELP YOU?
[1:53:33] HE CANNOT HELP YOU.
[1:53:35] RIGHT? SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN? IT MEANS
[1:53:37] YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE IN THE MAN FIRST
[1:53:42] to to hear from God.
[1:53:45] AND YOU SEE GOD TOLD BROTHER BAM, the
[1:53:48] prophet of this. He spoke to him and he
[1:53:51] said,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; you know, if people if you will make the
[1:53:55] people to believe you
[1:53:58] want people to believe me,
[1:54:03] if you will make the people to believe
[1:54:06] you,
[1:54:09] IT WILL COME TO PASS that not EVEN
[1:54:12] CANCER
[1:54:14] will stand before you.
[1:54:18] THINK ABOUT IT THAT THEY HAD TO BELIEVE
[1:54:22] THAT WILLIAM BRANA IS A PROPHET TO THIS
[1:54:25] GENERATION. THAT IS A MAN OF GOD THAT
[1:54:28] GOD HAS SAID AND THEY HAVE TO BELIEVE
[1:54:30] THAT AFTER THEY BELIEVE IT WHATEVER
[1:54:33] DISEASE THEY HAVE
[1:54:36] IT COULD NOT STAND BEFORE THE ANOINTING
[1:54:39] THAT WAS UPON WILLIAM.
[1:54:42] YOU see that's how God works in the days
[1:54:45] of Noah. SAME THING. IN THE DAYS WHEN
[1:54:48] ISRAEL HAD FORSAKEN GOD,
[1:54:51] he sent them the prophet HOSEA
[1:54:54] WHO MARRIED GMA,
[1:54:57] A PROSTITUTE,
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; A PROPHET OF GOD,
[1:55:02] MARRYING A PROSTITUTE.
[1:55:04] HE WAS A MAN [screaming]
[1:55:06] SENT FROM GOD, ANOINTED FOR THAT.
[1:55:10] WHY DID GOD ALLOW HIM TO MARRY A
[1:55:11] PROSTITUTE?
[1:55:13] GOD WAS SHOWING THAT THE SITUATION AND
[1:55:16] ATMOSPHERE,
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; THE CONDITION OF THE CHURCH, THEY'RE
[1:55:21] LIVING IN SPIRITUAL ADULTERY.
[1:55:24] [screaming] THEY THEY'RE LIVING IN
[1:55:25] IMMORALITY.
[1:55:27] THEY'RE GOING AFTER OTHER MEN.
[1:55:30] THEY'RE GOING AFTER OTHER IDEAS.
[1:55:32] [screaming] INSTEAD OF GOING AFTER ME,
[1:55:34] MY WIFE,
[1:55:36] MY HUSBAND, BUT THEY HAVE REFUSED ME.
[1:55:39] THEY HAVE GONE UNTO OTHERS
[1:55:42] TO SEEK FOR THEIR DESIRES.
[1:55:45] AND SO GOD TOLD THE MAN OF GOD,
[1:55:48] "MARRY A PROSTITUTE." AND THIS
[1:55:51] PROSTITUTE WAS GOING AFTER OTHER MEN,
[1:55:54] WHILE SHE WAS [screaming] MARRIED TO THE
[1:55:56] PROPHET OF GOD.
[1:56:00] WHY GOD ALLOWED IT WAS TO SEND A MESSAGE
[1:56:04] SO YOU COULD JUDGE THE MAN OF GOD ALL
[1:56:06] YOU LIKE.
[1:56:09] BUT HIS LIFE WAS A TESTIMONY IN THAT
[1:56:13] GENERATION. YOU COULD TRY TO MANEUVER
[1:56:17] AND TRY TO TO DISCARD HIM AND SAY HE'S
[1:56:21] NOT WORTHY AND HE'S NOT FIT FOR THE
[1:56:23] CALLING. BUT GOD HAD CHOSEN HIS MAN
[1:56:26] [screaming] AND IT WAS IN THE PROGRAM OF
[1:56:28] GOD
[1:56:30] WHATEVER HE WAS DOING WITH THAT MAN.
[1:56:33] LET ME TELL YOU BROTHERS AND SISTERS,
[1:56:34] WHEN GOD CALLS A MAN,
[1:56:37] GOD WANTS TO GUIDE THAT MAN. GOD WANTS
[1:56:40] TO LEAD THAT MAN. HE DOESN'T WANT THE
[1:56:42] CHURCH TO LEAD HIM. HE DOESN'T WANT THE
[1:56:44] CHURCH THE CHURCH TO CONTROL HIM. HE
[1:56:46] DOESN'T WANT THE MAN TO GUIDE HIM. HE
[1:56:49] WANTS HIMSELF [screaming]
[1:56:51] TO LEAD AND GUIDE HIM. THAT'S WHY HE SAY
[1:56:54] THE CHURCH IS NOT LED BY A SET OF
[1:56:56] DEACONS.
[1:56:58] A CHURCH IS NOT CONTROLLED BY A
[1:57:00] COMMITTEE.
[1:57:02] A CHURCH. YOU KNOW, GOD DOESN'T NEED
[1:57:04] YOUR MIND
[1:57:07] FOR HIM TO DO WHAT HE WANTS TO DO.
[1:57:10] GOD SENDS HIS MIND
[1:57:12] WITHOUT ASKING FOR YOUR OPINION
[1:57:15] AND THEN HE USES HIM [screaming] THE WAY
[1:57:17] HE WANTS TO USE HIM. THAT'S WHY EVERY
[1:57:20] CHURCH IS SOVEREIGN.
[1:57:23] [screaming]
[1:57:26] GOD PUTS A MAN THERE. HE ANOINTS HIM. HE
[1:57:29] SPEAKS TO HIM. HE GIVES HIM THE WORD AND
[1:57:32] THAT MAN IS ANSWERABLE TO GOD
[1:57:36] AND IS ACCOUNTABLE TO GOD.
[1:57:39] WHATEVER HE PREACHES, GOD WILL JUDGE
[1:57:42] HIM. [screaming] SO DON'T JUDGE HIM. LET
[1:57:46] GOD JUDGE HIM BECAUSE HE DIDN'T SEND
[1:57:48] HIM. THAT GOD WHO SENT HIM ALWAYS JUDGE
[1:57:52] HIM. IF YOU RECOGNIZE THAT GOD HAS
[1:57:55] CALLED A MAN, JUST SUPPORT THAT MAN. IF
[1:57:59] YOU THINK THE MAN IS OFF, PRAY FOR THAT
[1:58:02] MAN AND GOD WILL REWARD YOU AS WELL.
[1:58:07] AMEN. AND AMEN.
[1:58:09] &gt;&gt; SO THE STORY OF GMA is wonderful.
[1:58:14] Well, I believe those are their names.
[1:58:16] When David became
[1:58:19] so sinful,
[1:58:23] God sent them the prophet,
[1:58:26] A MAN WHO WAS NOT ONLY A NONITIZEN OF
[1:58:30] NINEVEH,
[1:58:34] BUT ALSO THE MAN WHO DEBATED WITH GOD.
[1:58:38] UNTIL TODAY, PEOPLE SEND JONAH
[1:58:42] WAS A FOR WAS A A A FALSE PROPHET.
[1:58:47] WHO WAS how do they call him? They say
[1:58:49] he someone knows the word.
[1:58:53] A dis a runaway prophet,
[1:58:57] a disobedient prophet.
[1:59:01] Wait a moment. Was he a prophet or not?
[1:59:05] &gt;&gt; HE WAS A PROPHET. SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD IN
[1:59:11] HIS MIND, HE HAD CHOSEN JONAH
[1:59:14] [screaming]
[1:59:15] AND HE KNEW HE WOULD SEND HIM.
[1:59:19] GOD CHOSE JONAH,
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; NOT FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. BUT HE SENT
[1:59:24] JONAH AND HE CHOSE JONAH FOR
[1:59:29] I DON'T KNOW [screaming] WHERE ELSE
[1:59:31] JONAH WENT. I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE JONAH
[1:59:35] ACCOMPLISHED. BUT WHAT I KNOW
[1:59:37] [screaming] JONAH HAD A TH SAYETH THE
[1:59:39] LORD
[1:59:41] FOR ONE CITY.
[1:59:44] [screaming] GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR ONE
[1:59:46] CITY. GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR ONE MINUTE.
[1:59:52] GOD CAN CALL A MAN FOR A GROUP OF
[1:59:54] PEOPLE. [screaming] GOD DOES WHAT HE
[1:59:56] WANTS TO DO.
[1:59:59] AND WHEN HE CALLED JONAH, JONAH
[2:00:01] DISOBEYED GOD. BUT EVEN THAT [screaming]
[2:00:05] WAS A PART OF THE BLOOD OF HELL.
[2:00:06] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:09] AND WHEN JESUS CAME, THEY SAID, "GIVE US
[2:00:13] A SIGN. SHOW US A SIGN." JESUS SAID,
[2:00:17] "YOU WANT A SIGN? I HAVE NO OTHER SIGN
[2:00:19] TO GIVE YOU. BUT I GIVE YOU THE SIGN OF
[2:00:22] [screaming] PROPHET JONAH."
[2:00:25] AMEN. AMEN. HOW HE WAS IN THE WHALE'S
[2:00:28] [screaming] BELLY
[2:00:30] FOR THREE DAYS AND NIGHT.
[2:00:33] THAT WAS A SYMBOL. THAT WAS A SIGN THAT
[2:00:37] WAS SAYING
[2:00:39] THE MESSIAH IS COMING.
[2:00:42] AMEN. HE WILL DIE FOR THREE DAYS AND
[2:00:45] NIGHT, BUT THEN RISE AGAIN AND BRING
[2:00:49] SALVATION TO THE WORLD.
[2:00:51] YOU SEE JONAH PROPHESIED THEY WERE GOING
[2:00:54] TO DIE BUT THEY WERE SAVED. That was a
[2:00:58] SIGN OF THE MESSIAH.
[2:01:00] THOSE WHO RECEIVE THE MESSIAH THEY
[2:01:02] CANNOT DIE. THEY WILL ALWAYS BE SAVED.
[2:01:05] THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAYS AMEN WE ARE
[2:01:08] DEAD AND OUR LIFE IS HID WITH GOD IN
[2:01:11] CHRIST.
[2:01:14] [cheering] WE CANNOT DIE THE SECOND
[2:01:16] TIME.
[2:01:17] WE DIED ONCE AND THAT SETTLES IT. WE ARE
[2:01:21] WAITING FOR THE RESURRECTION.
[2:01:24] HALLELUJAH. I SAY HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:26] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN.
[2:01:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; God chose Jonah anyways.
[2:01:32] YOU COULD DEBATE WITH GOD ALL YOU WANT.
[2:01:35] YOU COULD JUDGE JONAH ALL YOU WANT. BUT
[2:01:37] GOD [screaming] IS SAYING JONAH IS MY
[2:01:40] PROPHET.
[2:01:42] WHEN ISRAEL THOUGHT THEY WERE
[2:01:43] comfortable with the Lord,
[2:01:46] God sent John THE BAPTIST.
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; WHO WAS JOHN THE BAPTIST? HE WAS A REBEL
[2:01:54] WHO LIVED A QUESTIONABLE LIFE.
[2:01:57] I WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE FATHER OF
[2:01:59] JOHN THE BAPTIST
[2:02:01] IS CALLED ZECHARIAH. WHO HAS GOD
[2:02:04] ZECHARIAH? THIS MAN WAS A PROPHET OR
[2:02:06] RATHER A PRIEST and he served in the
[2:02:08] temple.
[2:02:10] Amen. and and HIS MOTHER WAS ELIZABETH.
[2:02:14] AND THIS WOMAN WAS BARREN.
[2:02:16] THIS IS THE same woman, YOU KNOW, WHO
[2:02:19] MET JESUS OR RATHER WHO MET MARY BECAUSE
[2:02:22] SHE WAS A COUSIN OF MARY.
[2:02:25] AND AT THAT TIME, YOU KNOW, SHE HAD A
[2:02:27] WOMB. BUT THIS WOMB WAS ALMOST DEAD.
[2:02:31] JOHN THE BAPTIST WAS IN THERE. ARE YOU
[2:02:35] FOLLOWING ME? AND THEN MARY CAME. MARY
[2:02:39] WAS THE WOMAN.
[2:02:41] THAT ARE FULFILLED SCRIPTURE. UNTO US A
[2:02:43] SON IS BORN, A CHILD IS GIVEN.
[2:02:47] You know THE MESSIAH WAS IN THAT WOMB. A
[2:02:52] VIRGIN SHALL CONCEIVE
[2:02:54] BRING FORTH A SON. THAT SCRIPTURE WAS
[2:02:58] FULFILLING MEN. THEY WERE COUSINS, BUT
[2:03:01] THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT EACH OF THEM WAS
[2:03:06] FULFILLING PROPHECY.
[2:03:08] GOD IS IN THE BUSINESS
[2:03:11] OF USING RELATIVES.
[2:03:13] [screaming]
[2:03:15] HALLELUJAH.
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; ARE YOU HEARING ME? EVEN WHEN IT CAME TO
[2:03:18] ISRAEL,
[2:03:20] HE TOLD THEM, "LOOK, I AM GOING TO
[2:03:23] CHOOSE ONE TRIBE.
[2:03:25] THE ONE OF LEVI, THAT ONE IS MINE."
[2:03:29] AMEN. YOU GO AND WORK AND GET THE LANDS.
[2:03:33] LET THE REST BRING GOD ALL THEIR TITHES
[2:03:37] AND TITHE TO THIS ONE.
[2:03:39] GOD USED ONE TRIBE.
[2:03:42] I CAN SAY GOD USED ONE family
[2:03:45] to BE PRIESTS
[2:03:47] IS THE SAME YESTERDAY, TODAY AND
[2:03:49] FOREVER.
[2:03:50] THAT'S WHY MANY TIMES LOOK AT EVERY
[2:03:53] PREACHER YOU KNOW.
[2:03:57] AMEN. IF THEY WERE IF THEY WERE IF THEIR
[2:03:59] FATHER WAS NOT A PREACHER,
[2:04:02] THEIR GRANDFATHER WAS. IF THEIR
[2:04:05] GRANDFATHER WAS NOT, THEIR
[2:04:07] GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS.
[2:04:10] AND SOMETIMES IF YOU THINK THEY DIDN'T
[2:04:12] HAVE ANY MINISTER IN THEIR FAMILY
[2:04:16] is only because you do not know the
[2:04:17] generations before.
[2:04:20] WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? GOD IS INTO THE
[2:04:23] BUSINESS OF DEALING WITH RELATIVES.
[2:04:28] I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY I'M SAYING THIS.
[2:04:31] ALL I'M SAYING IS I'M SEEING IT IN THE
[2:04:32] SCRIPTURE.
[2:04:35] &gt;&gt; MARY [screaming]
[2:04:37] WAS RELATED
[2:04:39] to Elizabeth.
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; ELIZABETH WAS RELATED TO MARY AND THEY
[2:04:45] GOING TO GIVE BIRTH TO CHILDREN WHO ARE
[2:04:49] RELATED TO EACH OTHER.
[2:04:52] AND THESE CHILDREN, ONE WOULD BE THE
[2:04:54] MESSIAH,
[2:04:56] ONE WOULD BE THE PREPARE THE PREPARER
[2:04:59] TO prepare for the Messiah.
[2:05:02] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; AND AND WHEN JOHN WAS DEAD,
[2:05:07] &gt;&gt; JESUS YES.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; WHILE BEING IN THE WOMB OF MARY
[2:05:10] [screaming]
[2:05:11] RESURRECTED HIM
[2:05:13] QUICKENED HIM. YOU KNOW, AS THEY HUGGED
[2:05:17] THE WOMB OF MARY TOUCH THE WOMB OF
[2:05:21] ELIZABETH,
[2:05:24] her womb, A CHILD WAS QUICKENED. AND THE
[2:05:26] BIBLE TELLS ME JOHN RECEIVED THE HOLY
[2:05:30] GHOST IN his mother's.
[2:05:34] [screaming]
[2:05:36] What do you want TO DO WITH THAT
[2:05:37] SCRIPTURE?
[2:05:40] AMEN. THERE IS NO FORMULA OF RECEIVING
[2:05:42] THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:05:46] GOD GIVES IT TO WHOEVER HE DESIRES.
[2:05:48] [screaming]
[2:05:50] AMEN. AMEN. HE HATED ESAU.
[2:05:55] AND HE LOVED JACOB BEFORE THEY WERE
[2:05:57] BORN. I AM SO GLAD THIS MORNING. I AM AN
[2:06:01] ELECT OF GOD. I AM A SEED OF GOD. I WAS
[2:06:04] IN THE MIND OF GOD BEFORE THE FOUNDATION
[2:06:07] OF the world. AND YOU KNOW THIS CHILD
[2:06:09] CAME FORTH AND THE FATHER WAS A PRIEST.
[2:06:13] BUT BUT YOU KNOW SOMETHING WAS
[2:06:15] HAPPENING.
[2:06:17] THIS boy rebelled.
[2:06:21] He didn't come to church. He refused.
[2:06:26] WHEN OTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FULFILLING
[2:06:28] THE LAW
[2:06:30] FOR HIM, HE WAS very busy doing and
[2:06:31] living against the law.
[2:06:37] See how he kept HIS HAIR.
[2:06:40] YOU THINK IT WAS NORMAL? NO, IT WAS
[2:06:45] a priest had you you if you go in the
[2:06:48] Old Testament in Leviticus
[2:06:50] and you read the qualifications of
[2:06:51] PRIEST
[2:06:54] the way they had to do their beard their
[2:06:56] hair AND EVERYTHING.
[2:06:58] JOHN WAS OPPOSITE.
[2:07:04] They even they THEY EVEN GOD EVEN TOLD
[2:07:07] THEM WHAT TO EAT.
[2:07:10] JOHN WENT AGAINST THAT TOO.
[2:07:13] HE ATE LOCUST
[2:07:15] and wild honey.
[2:07:19] John did NOT EVEN LEAVE. THEY EVEN HAD
[2:07:20] TO LIVE IN INDEENT ENVIRONMENTS.
[2:07:25] WHEN THERE IS SOMETHING DEAD,
[2:07:27] [screaming]
[2:07:28] they even had TO BE CLEANSED FOR A
[2:07:30] NUMBER OF DAYS.
[2:07:33] JOHN LIVED IN THE FOREST IN THE BUSH.
[2:07:37] THAT IS STICKING THINGS.
[2:07:40] SO HE HE WAS DISQUALIFIED
[2:07:43] AS A PRIEST.
[2:07:46] &gt;&gt; BUT THEN GOD
[2:07:48] HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; GOD
[2:07:53] WENT OVER THE PEOPLE'S FAULT.
[2:07:58] AND HE SENT JOHN. THAT'S WHY JOHN WAS
[2:08:01] NOT RECEIVED AS THE ELIJAH.
[2:08:06] AND WHEN JESUS THE MESSIAH CAME,
[2:08:09] HE SAID, "IF YOU WILL RECEIVE IT,
[2:08:12] THIS MEANING JOHN WAS THE ELIJAH
[2:08:15] [screaming]
[2:08:16] WHICH WAS FOR TO COME."
[2:08:18] MEANING, I KNOW IT IS HARD FOR IT TO
[2:08:20] RECEIVE.
[2:08:22] BUT I TELL YOU, [screaming]
[2:08:24] JOHN WAS ELIJAH. JOHN WAS ELIJAH. BUT
[2:08:28] STILL, THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND.
[2:08:30] ONLY THE ELECT CAN UNDERSTAND.
[2:08:34] EVEN IN OUR GENERATION, WILLIAM BRHAM
[2:08:36] [screaming]
[2:08:37] IS THE ELIJAH IS THE MALACHI 4 TO OUR
[2:08:41] GENERATION. BUT THEY CAN'T RECEIVE IT
[2:08:44] BECAUSE [screaming] THEY ARE NOT
[2:08:46] ORDAINED
[2:08:47] TO RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE TO BELIEVE THIS
[2:08:50] MESSAGE. BUT YOU AND I, MY BROTHER,
[2:08:52] [screaming]
[2:08:53] WE ARE ORDAINED BY
[2:08:55] BE BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE.
[2:08:58] WE SAY ELIJAH IS COMING. ELIJAH IS
[2:09:02] COMING.
[2:09:03] HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; JOHN THE BAPTIST
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; WAS, you know, QUESTIONABLE
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; and he was a rebel,
[2:09:11] &gt;&gt; but yet God called him. ALL MEN THAT GOD
[2:09:14] SENT TO HAVE A TURNING POINT
[2:09:18] AT EVERY SEASON OR GENERATION, they
[2:09:22] never felt they themselves that they
[2:09:24] were QUALIFIED
[2:09:28] and the people never APPROVED OF THEM.
[2:09:31] Only God thought they were the right MEN
[2:09:37] for the mission that would fulfill God's
[2:09:39] vision
[2:09:42] for his people.
[2:09:44] Exodus 3.
[2:09:47] Brethren, I'm beginning to move. Please,
[2:09:48] please.
[2:09:50] Try your best to sit for at least one
[2:09:53] hour.
[2:09:54] Exodus 3:7.
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:00] And and I'm reading there to try and
[2:10:03] show you the example
[2:10:05] of Israel
[2:10:07] when God called Moses.
[2:10:09] And the Lord God said, "I have surely
[2:10:10] seen the affliction of my people which
[2:10:12] are in Egypt. And I've heard their cry
[2:10:14] by reason of their task masters. For I
[2:10:16] know their sorrows. And I am come down
[2:10:19] to deliver them out of the hand of the
[2:10:21] Egyptians, and to bring them up out of
[2:10:23] the that land, and unto a good land, and
[2:10:26] a large, and unto a land flowing with
[2:10:28] milk and honey, to a place of the
[2:10:30] Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites,
[2:10:34] and the Perizzites, and the Heivites,
[2:10:36] and the Jebites. Now therefore, behold,
[2:10:39] a cry of the children of Israel is come
[2:10:40] unto me, and I have also seen the
[2:10:42] oppression wherewith the Egyptians
[2:10:44] oppress them. Come now therefore, and I
[2:10:46] will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou
[2:10:48] mayest bring forth my people, the
[2:10:50] children of Israel, out of Egypt. And
[2:10:52] Moses said unto God, Who am I that I
[2:10:54] should go unto Pharaoh, and I should
[2:10:56] bring forth the children of Israel out
[2:10:58] of the Egypt, out of Egypt? And he,
[2:11:01] excuse me, vers 12. And he said,
[2:11:03] suddenly I would bring I'll be with
[2:11:05] thee, and this shall be a token unto
[2:11:07] thee that I have sent thee when thou
[2:11:09] hast brought forth the people out of
[2:11:11] Egypt. Ye shall serve God upon this
[2:11:14] mountain. Now I want you to see that
[2:11:16] Moses.
[2:11:18] When God sent him,
[2:11:20] Moses quickly felt unworthy
[2:11:25] to do this noble work.
[2:11:28] That's why brother Bham tells us the man
[2:11:30] that wants TO DO THE JOB
[2:11:33] IS NOT the man
[2:11:36] that God wants for the job.
[2:11:40] BUT THE MAN WHO DOESN'T WANT TO DO IT,
[2:11:44] THAT'S THE ONE THAT God has called.
[2:11:47] YOU UNDERSTAND? NO ONE MAN OF God that
[2:11:50] God has ever called,
[2:11:54] has desired
[2:11:56] or wanted
[2:11:58] or was fighting for
[2:12:01] doing what God wanted.
[2:12:03] It has always been a am I worthy?
[2:12:08] Am I prepared? Am I the right guy? And
[2:12:12] you know, THERE'S THAT SEASON WHERE YOU
[2:12:14] HAVE TO STEP BACK and listen
[2:12:17] and ask yourself, am I the am I the God?
[2:12:21] Am I the man that God really HAS CALLED?
[2:12:24] SO MOSES WHEN GOD TOLD HIM,
[2:12:27] he felt quickly unworthy. HE SAID, "GOD,
[2:12:30] WHO am I?" You remember I preached on a
[2:12:33] man. I'm a man
[2:12:35] under divine assignment.
[2:12:38] YOU know when GOD CALLS THAT MAN,
[2:12:41] IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MAN. It's about the
[2:12:44] divine assignment that THAT
[2:12:48] DID YOU KNOW GOD GAVE AN ASSIGNMENT EVEN
[2:12:51] TO THE PERSON that bore you naturally.
[2:12:56] YOU SEE, GOD DETERMINED WHO WOULD BE
[2:12:58] YOUR FATHER
[2:13:01] and your mother. SOME OF YOU ARE HERE
[2:13:04] TODAY BECAUSE OF THE FATHER AND THE
[2:13:06] MOTHER YOU HAVE.
[2:13:08] SOME OF YOU BECAUSE THEY'RE BELIEVERS,
[2:13:11] others because they disappointed you in
[2:13:13] life
[2:13:14] and you ended up here. You end up
[2:13:17] believing the message. I AM ONE OF
[2:13:19] THOSE. WHAT AM I TRYING TO SAY? GOD
[2:13:21] DETERMINED WHO WOULD BE YOUR FATHER
[2:13:24] BECAUSE HE GAVE THAT MAN AN ASSIGNMENT.
[2:13:27] RAISE MY SON.
[2:13:29] THERE'S AN ASSIGNMENT FOR HIM.
[2:13:34] But he COULD NOT SAY NO.
[2:13:38] AMEN. IF GOD HAD [screaming] PICKED THAT
[2:13:40] MAN,
[2:13:42] THAT MAN CANNOT SAY NO. IF GOD HAS SPEAK
[2:13:45] TO YOU, BROTHER, IF GOD HAS SPEAK,
[2:13:49] YOU CANNOT SAY NO.
[2:13:52] WELL, YOU CAN TRY BUT YOU CANNOT MANAGE
[2:13:55] TO SAY NO.
[2:13:58] PLEASE UNDERSTAND THAT GOD HAD PREPARED
[2:14:01] MOSES
[2:14:03] FOR THIS JOB RIGHT BEFORE HE WAS IN HIS
[2:14:06] MOTHER'S WOMB
[2:14:10] WHATEVER GOD HAS CALLED YOU TO DO. HE
[2:14:12] PREPARED YOU BEFORE YOU WERE IN YOUR
[2:14:14] MOTHER.
[2:14:16] YOU ARE PREPARED. I SAY I AM PREPARED.
[2:14:20] DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR WEAKNESSES. DON'T
[2:14:24] WORRY [screaming] ABOUT YOUR FAILURES.
[2:14:26] AM I PREACHING TO SOMEONE HERE TODAY? IF
[2:14:29] YOU HAVE BEEN CALLED BY GOD, YOU HAVE
[2:14:31] BEEN PREPARED BY GOD AND YOU MUST DO
[2:14:35] WHAT GOD CALLED YOU TO DO. YOU MUST
[2:14:38] ACCOMPLISH IT.
[2:14:40] IT'S NOT EASY THOUGH. But you have to do
[2:14:43] it.
[2:14:45] Beautiful things are always found in
[2:14:47] thorns.
[2:14:51] You are that one. THERE ARE THORNS
[2:14:53] AROUND YOU.
[2:14:56] BUT DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE THORNS. WORRY
[2:14:58] ABOUT THE ROAD [screaming]
[2:15:01] IN THE middle of the throne.
[2:15:05] GOD HAD A PURPOSE FOR HIS LIFE.
[2:15:08] HE HAD ORDAINED HIM TO CARRY OUT A
[2:15:12] mission
[2:15:15] that WOULD FULFILL
[2:15:18] God's vision.
[2:15:21] AMEN. IS IT AMEN, CHURCH?
[2:15:25] ALL RIGHT. Let deacons ask those who are
[2:15:27] outside to come and feast.
[2:15:30] If you feel it is hot, just come in and
[2:15:32] let it be hot. But God will help you.
[2:15:35] I remember in Tabernacle, they used to
[2:15:37] stand way behind
[2:15:40] because the chairs were all full
[2:15:43] and they would stand through a
[2:15:45] three-hour service.
[2:15:48] And I'm not even going to probably maybe
[2:15:49] preach half of it.
[2:15:52] Let us go through this.
[2:15:54] Tell your neighbor, "LET'S GO THROUGH
[2:15:55] THIS."
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Exodus 3. Exter 3. This morning,
[2:16:03] God has anointed me with THIS
[2:16:04] INSPIRATION.
[2:16:06] And I hope it will help you TO SEE what
[2:16:09] God is doing in your life
[2:16:12] and in our generation. Verse three. AND
[2:16:15] I AM COME DOWN. [screaming]
[2:16:18] This is God DECLARING HIS VISION.
[2:16:21] AND I AM COME DOWN.
[2:16:23] TO DELIVER THEM OUT OF the hand of the
[2:16:26] Egyptians.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; Can I prophesy?
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; CAN I PROPHESY?
[2:16:34] [screaming] GOD HAS COME DOWN
[2:16:36] THIS GENERATION TO DELIVER YOU TO
[2:16:39] DELIVER ME OUT [screaming] OF THE HANDS
[2:16:41] OF THE EGYPTIANS.
[2:16:44] AMEN. AMEN. CALL ME A FANATIC IF YOU
[2:16:46] LIKE.
[2:16:48] AMEN. THAT'S THE TRUTH.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; BUT HOW DOES GOD COME DOWN? GOD COMES
[2:16:54] DOWN THROUGH SENDING A MESSENGER
[2:16:58] WITH A MESSAGE [screaming]
[2:17:00] OF RESTORATION.
[2:17:04] [cheering]
[2:17:04] I'M COME DOWN TO DELIVER THEM out of the
[2:17:08] hand of the EGYPTIANS AND TO BRING THEM
[2:17:10] UP
[2:17:12] OUT OF THAT LAND UNTO A GOOD LAND AND A
[2:17:17] LARGE UNTO A LAND FLOWING WITH MILK and
[2:17:21] honey.
[2:17:23] God wanted to take THEM TO A LAND.
[2:17:26] GOD WANTED TO TAKE THEM TO THAT WAS THE
[2:17:29] VISION.
[2:17:31] [screaming]
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:17:35] &gt;&gt; GOD WANTS TO TAKE US TO OUR LAND.
[2:17:39] [cheering] HALLELUJAH.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; COME ON, [screaming] RECEIVE THE
[2:17:42] REVELATION. GOD WANTS TO TAKE US TO OUR
[2:17:44] LAND.
[2:17:47] AMEN. AMEN. [screaming]
[2:17:48] AMEN. YES, SIR.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? BEFORE GOD TAKES THEM
[2:17:52] TO OUR LAND, HE HAS TO SEND THEM A MAN
[2:17:56] AND ANOINT HIM WITH THE ANOINTING OF
[2:17:59] THIS VISION. [screaming]
[2:18:01] HOW IT IS GOING TO BE ACCOMPLISHED.
[2:18:07] &gt;&gt; IF THEY BELIEVE IN THAT MAN, THE VISION
[2:18:10] WILL COME RIGHT QUICK. IF THEY DON'T,
[2:18:13] THE VISION WILL STILL COME SOON,
[2:18:16] but it will delay.
[2:18:18] But always it comes by the man God has.
[2:18:25] SEE, DAVID WANTED TO BUILD A TABERNACLE
[2:18:27] FOR
[2:18:29] HIM. GOD TOLD HIM,
[2:18:32] NO, THANK YOU.
[2:18:35] You are not the MAN I'VE ORDAINED. GOD
[2:18:38] HAD ANOINTED DAVID
[2:18:41] WITH ANOINTING OF WAR
[2:18:43] TO ANOINTING OF WAR. HE WAS A MAN OF WAR
[2:18:48] TO DESTROY
[2:18:49] THE ENEMIES OF ISRAEL
[2:18:52] TO EXPAND.
[2:18:54] BUT YOU SEE, THAT WAS HIS CALLING. THAT
[2:18:57] WAS HIS ASSIGNMENT.
[2:19:00] BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? DAVID WANTED TO
[2:19:02] OVERSTEP
[2:19:05] HIS ASSIGNMENT
[2:19:08] AND HE WANTED TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.
[2:19:11] WHEN GOD CALLS YOU, BETTER KNOW WHAT HE
[2:19:13] HAS ASSIGNED YOU TO DO.
[2:19:16] EVERY CHURCH HAS A VISION.
[2:19:19] IF YOU'RE A PASTOR, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT
[2:19:21] HAS GOD CALLED YOU.
[2:19:23] IF YOU'RE A MINISTER, IF YOU'RE AN
[2:19:25] EVANGELIST, [screaming] IF YOU'RE A
[2:19:26] PROPHET, YOU MUST KNOW WHAT IS MY
[2:19:28] ASSIGNMENT,
[2:19:31] God who SIGNS YOU UP,
[2:19:34] GIVES YOU AN ASSIGNMENT.
[2:19:36] GOD WHO CALLS YOU
[2:19:39] GIVES YOU [screaming] WHAT TO DO.
[2:19:41] IT MIGHT BE MARRIAGE. WHEN YOU'RE
[2:19:43] WALKING INTO A MARRIAGE, YOU MUST KNOW
[2:19:47] [screaming] THIS IS WHAT GOD WANTS YOU.
[2:19:50] WHY ARE YOU MARRYING THAT MAN?
[2:19:53] WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO ACCOMPLISH?
[2:19:56] SOME OF THEM ENTER INTO A MARRIAGE
[2:19:58] AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THIS MAN
[2:20:01] WANTS TO HAVE 12 CHILDREN.
[2:20:08] AND THEN YOU GET IN THERE AND FOR YOU
[2:20:11] WANT TO HAVE ONE. AND THE MAN SAYS, "I
[2:20:13] WANT TO say
[2:20:18] [panting] and THEN MARRIAGE BREAKS."
[2:20:20] SO YOU WALKED INTO THAT MARRIAGE WITHOUT
[2:20:23] KNOWING YOUR ASSIGNMENT.
[2:20:26] BROTHER, SISTER, WHEN YOU ARE QUOTING
[2:20:28] EACH OTHER,
[2:20:30] FIND OUT, ARE YOU MEANT FOR THAT
[2:20:32] MARRIAGE?
[2:20:34] FIND OUT [screaming]
[2:20:35] IS THIS ONE THE RIGHT ONE FOR ME.
[2:20:38] HOW DO YOU KNOW? YOU KNOW THEM BY THEIR
[2:20:41] CHARACTER.
[2:20:43] FIND THAT MAN'S CHARACTER. FIND THE
[2:20:45] WOMAN'S CHARACTER. WHAT IS HIS VISION
[2:20:50] FOR THE FUTURE OF HIS HOME?
[2:20:52] WHY YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF THAT
[2:20:53] VISION?
[2:20:55] IF NOT, jump out.
[2:20:59] BUT PEOPLE JUST SAY, "HEY, YOU'RE
[2:21:01] BEAUTIFUL.
[2:21:02] YOU MAKE ME FEEL THINGS.
[2:21:05] WHEN I SEE YOU, I JUST FEEL A cry
[2:21:09] and then they get married and they
[2:21:11] realize the vision is different."
[2:21:14] You see, oh, THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT
[2:21:17] THINGS.
[2:21:18] GOD SAID, I'M TAKING YOU TO A LAND,
[2:21:22] A LAND [screaming] FLOWING.
[2:21:25] That was God's vision.
[2:21:29] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. AND TO A PLACE OF THE
[2:21:32] CANONITES, OF THE HITTITES, OF THE
[2:21:35] AMORITES, OF THE PERISITES, [screaming]
[2:21:38] THE JEITE.
[2:21:40] OH MY MY DON'T BE LIKE A ROCK ON YOUR
[2:21:43] HEEL IN YOUR LIFE.
[2:21:45] BE LIKE AN EAGLE FRIEND.
[2:21:47] SET YOURSELF FREE. [screaming]
[2:21:49] &gt;&gt; TO BRING THEM OUT OF EGYPT
[2:21:52] WAS THE VISION
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; TO TAKE THEM TO CANON.
[2:21:56] THIS [screaming] LAND WAS NOT BARE LAND.
[2:22:00] God was taking THEM TO A LAND
[2:22:03] THAT WAS NOT FREE.
[2:22:06] THIS LAND WAS OCCUPIED [screaming]
[2:22:09] BY THE ENEMIES OF ISRAEL. BUT GOD HAD
[2:22:14] ANOINTED A MAN WITH A ANOINTING
[2:22:18] THAT REGARDLESS
[2:22:20] REGARDLESS IF THERE ARE PEOPLE
[2:22:22] [screaming] THERE. THIS MAN WAS ANOINTED
[2:22:26] WITH A VISION. WE MUST DRIVE EVERYONE.
[2:22:31] HALLELUJAH.
[2:22:32] THAT MEANS GOD ENVISIONED
[2:22:35] THAT HIS PEOPLE WOULD HAVE TO DRIVE OUT
[2:22:36] THE INHABITANTS
[2:22:38] [screaming]
[2:22:39] OF THE LAND SO THEY COULD POSSESS IT.
[2:22:42] THIS IS A TYPE OF THE VISION
[2:22:45] GOD HAS FOR THE NEW TESTAMENT CHURCH.
[2:22:49] TODAY
[2:22:51] THE TRUE CHURCH MUST POSSESS [screaming]
[2:22:55] EVERY REDEMPTIBLE
[2:22:58] OF GOD IN THIS HOUSE. WE MUST DRIVE OUT
[2:23:01] [screaming]
[2:23:02] OUR ENEMIES FROM OUR LAND
[2:23:06] FROM EVERY PROMISE
[2:23:08] OF THE WORD OF GOD.
[2:23:10] BUT LET ME TELL YOU SAINTS, GOD HAD
[2:23:14] ANOINTED A MAN.
[2:23:16] AMEN CALLED MOSES. HE WAS ANOINTED
[2:23:20] TO DRIVE OUT EVERY ENEMY, EVERYITE,
[2:23:25] EVERY EVIL, EVERYONE [screaming]
[2:23:28] OUT OF THEIR LIFE.
[2:23:30] BUT YOU SEE AS I WILL SHOW YOU SHORTLY,
[2:23:34] POLITICS CAME
[2:23:37] AND SUFFOCATED MOSES
[2:23:39] AND PUT MOSES IN A SITUATION
[2:23:42] WHERE [screaming] HE COULD NOT HELP
[2:23:43] THEM.
[2:23:49] Oh goodness.
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; Listen church.
[2:23:53] GOD IN THIS HOUR HE HAS SENT US A MOSES.
[2:23:58] I SAID MOSES, THE PROPHET OF THIS HOUSE.
[2:24:03] HE'S ANOINTED.
[2:24:05] HIS MESSAGE IS ANOINTED.
[2:24:08] I don't know whether you HAVE EVER HEARD
[2:24:10] THIS.
[2:24:12] IT SAYS LIKE THIS.
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; As I sent JOHN
[2:24:17] as John for my first come,
[2:24:21] your message will my second coming.
[2:24:27] THE VISION IS IS coming
[2:24:31] and THE MISSION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A
[2:24:35] PROPHET.
[2:24:36] HE HAS TO FOR
[2:24:39] HIS MESSAGE TO FORAN.
[2:24:41] IF YOUR NEED IS COMING,
[2:24:43] JESUS IS COMING. RECEIVE THE PROPHETY'S
[2:24:46] MESSAGE.
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; AMEN. BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? TODAY PEOPLE
[2:24:53] ANOINTED
[2:24:55] WITH A SPIRIT OF POLITICS.
[2:24:58] THEY ARE TRYING TO DISCREDIT THE PROPHET
[2:25:01] OF THIS HOUR.
[2:25:05] SAYING ELIJAH IS NOT COMING.
[2:25:08] THEY SAYING WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR.
[2:25:10] WE HAVE THE HOLY SPIRIT. ANSWER ME THIS
[2:25:13] QUESTION. WHERE WAS THE HOLY SPIRIT WHEN
[2:25:17] GOD SENT MOSES?
[2:25:19] ARE YOU SAYING TO ME THAT THE HOLY
[2:25:22] SPIRIT WAS NOT THERE
[2:25:24] YET? HE WAS THERE ENOUGH TO FILL JOHN IN
[2:25:26] THE WOMB.
[2:25:30] BUT HE [screaming] WAS NOT THERE WHEN
[2:25:33] GOD SAID, "I HAVE COME DOWN TO DELIVER
[2:25:36] THEM WITH A MIGHTY HAND." SO WHY DIDN'T
[2:25:40] HE SEND A SPIRIT
[2:25:44] COME OUT?
[2:25:46] GOD DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. HE HAD TO
[2:25:48] USE A MAN ON THE GROUND.
[2:25:52] AMEN. [screaming] AMEN. TO BRING A
[2:25:53] MESSAGE. A MESSAGE WAS SAYING COME OUT
[2:25:57] OF OUR

[2:26:01] RECEIVED A MESSENGER IN THIS GENERATION.
[2:26:05] OH, HELP ME PREACH SOMEBODY. WE HAVE
[2:26:07] RECEIVED A MESSENGER WITH A MESSAGE.
[2:26:10] COME OUT OF MY PEOPLE.
[2:26:13] AMEN.
[2:26:14] &gt;&gt; COME OUT OF CATHOLICISM. COME OUT OF THE
[2:26:17] NATION. COME OUT OF PENTECOSTALISM.

[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; OH, HALLELUJAH.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S A RAPTURE MESSAGE.
[2:26:46] ANYONE
[2:26:48] WHO SAYS GOD DID NOT SEND A PROPHET,
[2:26:52] WELL, you have COME TOO LATE.
[2:26:55] SOME PEOPLE here believe it.
[2:26:59] SOME PEOPLE HERE BELIEVE [screaming] IT.
[2:27:03] If you doubt it,
[2:27:05] don't you worry. The Holy Spirit will

[2:28:47] IS CATCHING IT. AND I'M HAVING A MESSAGE

[2:29:18] CRAZY.

[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; WE SAY HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:31:30] &gt;&gt; You see that's the vision.
[2:31:33] You may be seated. Then a mission.
[2:31:36] Exodus 3:10, HE SAYS, "COME NOW,
[2:31:37] THEREFORE,
[2:31:39] AND I WILL SEND THEE UNTO PHARAOH."
[2:31:42] NOW HE'S GIVING HIM THE MISSION
[2:31:45] THAT THOU MAY SPRING FORTH MY PEOPLE,
[2:31:48] THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT.
[2:31:50] Exodus 7:16. AND THOU SHALT SAY UNTO
[2:31:53] HIM, THE LORD GOD OF HEBREWS
[2:31:56] HAS SENT me unto thee. That's why Bam
[2:32:01] says before you begin preaching,
[2:32:04] be sure
[2:32:06] God has called you.
[2:32:09] How on those sacred sons?
[2:32:13] If you don't know,
[2:32:17] if you don't know you are called,
[2:32:20] DON'T STEP ON THE PIT.
[2:32:24] WHY? BECAUSE IF YOU'RE CALLED, YOU EVEN
[2:32:27] know the duty, your job, your
[2:32:28] assignment.
[2:32:31] We are not looking for good quotes and
[2:32:32] good scriptures to read for people.
[2:32:36] BEFORE I BEGIN PREACHING, GOD HAS TOLD
[2:32:39] ME WHAT THAT SERVICE IS GOING TO
[2:32:40] ACCOMPLISH.
[2:32:44] SO, AS I'M PREACHING, THAT THING IS
[2:32:46] MATERIALIZING.
[2:32:48] BEFORE MOSES WENT, GOD HAD TOLD HIM WHAT
[2:32:52] HE IS GOING TO DO.
[2:32:54] HE KNEW IT. AND HE KNEW WHEN HE SAYS,
[2:32:57] "LET [screaming] MY PEOPLE GO."
[2:33:01] HE knew the people will GO
[2:33:05] because it's not his word.
[2:33:08] He did not go to theology
[2:33:10] or started to get a good word to speak.
[2:33:14] That's why preaching must be by
[2:33:15] inspiration.
[2:33:18] THAT THEY MAY SERVE ME IN THE
[2:33:19] WILDERNESS.
[2:33:21] AMEN.
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; And here too that thou would not hear.
[2:33:25] Now when God sends a man,
[2:33:28] he has prepared him and given him a
[2:33:31] message.
[2:33:33] Many people are running aimlessly
[2:33:39] without any message. Do you know the
[2:33:41] story of Akmas?
[2:33:43] One time Abselum went against his
[2:33:46] father.
[2:33:48] his father David.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; And uh you know David had a a a captain
[2:33:55] CALLED JOB. JOB WAS THE CAPTAIN OF THE
[2:33:58] HORSE.
[2:34:00] AND uh you know you know uh the king
[2:34:04] told uh the THE JOB
[2:34:07] GO OUT [screaming]
[2:34:09] TRY TO KILL THAT UH REBELLION
[2:34:14] but make sure my son Abselum
[2:34:18] is not killed.
[2:34:20] Don't touch him. But go and make sure
[2:34:22] they stop that kind of thing.
[2:34:25] AND SO HE WENT AND AS THEY WERE FIGHTING
[2:34:28] AND FIGHTING AND FIGHTING,
[2:34:30] [screaming] YOU KNOW. UH THEN ABSELUM
[2:34:33] WAS ON A HORSE
[2:34:37] TAKING OFF AND THEN THEY REACHED
[2:34:39] SOMEWHERE
[2:34:40] AND THE HORSE WENT STRAIGHT FOR a tree.
[2:34:46] AND THIS TREE
[2:34:48] HAD A VE
[2:34:52] AND THE HEAD OF ABSELUM
[2:34:55] WAS squeezed there.
[2:34:59] HELP ME SOMEBODY HELP ME. SOMEBODY HELP
[2:35:01] ME. SOMEBODY HELP ME. AND THEN JOB CAME
[2:35:05] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BEING A SOLDIER THAT
[2:35:08] HE WAS
[2:35:10] AND KNOWING HOW MUCH TROUBLE THIS MAN
[2:35:12] HAD CAUSED
[2:35:15] HIS LIFE WAS TAKEN.
[2:35:19] And then you know uh IN THE MIDST OF ALL
[2:35:23] THAT THERE WAS A LOT OF COMMOTION
[2:35:27] AND THINGS [screaming] AND PEOPLE
[2:35:30] everybody shouting
[2:35:32] heard the noise.
[2:35:36] He quickly RAN TO JOAB
[2:35:38] AND TOLD HIM, "JO,
[2:35:41] CAPTAIN, PLEASE LET ME GO TO THE KING.
[2:35:45] LET ME TELL HIM THE NEWS."
[2:35:47] AND HE SAID, "YOU TELL HIM,
[2:35:50] LET ME TELL HIM WHAT I HAVE HEARD. I
[2:35:53] HEARD A lot of noise and commotion."
[2:35:57] He told him, "You can't go. You will go
[2:35:59] another day. TO THIS DAY you cannot go
[2:36:04] because you DON'T HAVE A MESSAGE TO GO
[2:36:06] TO TELL THE KING BUT I MUST say
[2:36:11] my my captain PLEASE GIVE ME THIS CHANCE
[2:36:15] LET ME GO GIVE ME ALSO DELIVER THE the
[2:36:20] king some news
[2:36:23] he SAID OKAY SINCE YOU HAVE INSISTED
[2:36:27] YOU CAN go
[2:36:30] and
[2:36:32] called Kushi.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Kushi was THERE THE WHOLE TIME.
[2:36:35] &gt;&gt; HE SAW EVERYTHING AND HE TELLS KUSHI,
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; "You've seen everything,
[2:36:41] &gt;&gt; yes, you've heard everything.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. go and tell the king what you have
[2:36:46] seen and heard and started running and
[2:36:51] was not just RUNNING
[2:36:55] TAKING OFF
[2:36:58] AND
[2:36:59] HE NOT EVEN USE THE MAIN ROAD.
[2:37:02] He used a shortcut.
[2:37:05] SO BEFORE KUSHI [screaming] ARRIVED,
[2:37:09] had already arrived
[2:37:12] AND THE THE SOLDIERS IN THE BALCONY.
[2:37:16] SO I WAS RUNNING
[2:37:18] AND THE KING SAW
[2:37:20] SOMEONE RUNNING.
[2:37:22] AND THEY SAID, "HEY, they said this
[2:37:25] running
[2:37:27] who is that one?" But the running is
[2:37:30] like the running of Akmas.
[2:37:34] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, Don't run like
[2:37:36] arguments
[2:37:37] without an assignment.
[2:37:41] I HAVE ZEAL.
[2:37:44] WAIT UNTIL GOD ASSIGNED HIM.
[2:37:48] And he ran and he ran and he arrived
[2:37:54] and the king.
[2:37:56] He said, "I want to see the king.
[2:37:58] I WANT TO SEE THE KING.
[2:38:05] He must have had crossed legs because
[2:38:08] he's like that of Akmas.
[2:38:21] And when he arrived sas
[2:38:26] was received by the king and the king
[2:38:29] told him
[2:38:31] because the king was testing tell me
[2:38:34] what happened MY SON.
[2:38:38] HE SAID, "OKAY, LONG LIVE THE KING.
[2:38:43] Long live the king.
[2:38:51] What is it? My son,
[2:38:55] YOU ARE THE BEST."
[2:38:57] HE JUST WANTED TO BE IN the presence of
[2:38:58] the king.
[2:39:01] He didn't have a message.
[2:39:04] Oh king, A MESSAGE, I TOLD YOU. THERE
[2:39:08] WAS A LOT OF NOISE
[2:39:11] AS THEY WERE SHOUTING.
[2:39:13] I HEARD ANOTHER NOISE
[2:39:15] AND THE KING IS WAITING FOR the king.
[2:39:19] SO AND AND THEN AND THEN AND THEN
[2:39:21] [screaming]
[2:39:22] I MUST TALK
[2:39:25] AND THEN
[2:39:27] SHOUTING
[2:39:30] STAND ON THE SIDE BE QUIET. [screaming]
[2:39:33] THE KING ORDERED him said, "You have no
[2:39:35] message today."
[2:39:38] And as SOON AS THAT HAPPENED,
[2:39:41] SHE ARRIVED.
[2:39:42] Long live the king.
[2:39:45] I'm here to I'm here to bring tith.
[2:39:48] But I'm sorry the son
[2:39:52] is dead.
[2:39:57] THE KING BROKE DOWN.
[2:40:00] IF you are HAVING AN ASSIGNMENT,
[2:40:03] YOU WILL BRING A message that will break
[2:40:05] people's hearts
[2:40:09] to receive Christ.
[2:40:12] Cuz our hearts are hard. I tell you,
[2:40:17] IT TAKES GOD. IT TAKES AN ANOINTING. IT
[2:40:21] TAKES A CALLING
[2:40:23] AND THE GRACE of God upon someone.
[2:40:28] See friends, One, many people are
[2:40:30] running aimlessly LIKE I WAS
[2:40:33] WITHOUT ANY MESSAGE. BUT GOD AT EVERY
[2:40:36] JUNCTION OF TIME,
[2:40:40] he will send a cushy ANOINTED WITH A
[2:40:42] WORD OF DELIVERANCE
[2:40:46] TO CARRY OUT THE MISSION
[2:40:48] THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT the vision.
[2:40:51] Now, I want you to listen to a few
[2:40:53] quotes I'm going to quote for you. In
[2:40:55] the discernment of the spirit, the
[2:40:58] prophet says, "A New Testament prophet
[2:41:00] is a preacher."
[2:41:05] The New Testament prophet is a preacher.
[2:41:09] We all KNOW THAT JUST ANY MINISTER
[2:41:11] THAT'S A PREACHER IS A PROPHET.
[2:41:14] AMEN. PRAY FOR HIM. We still have about
[2:41:15] 20 more minutes. AMEN. A NEW TESTAMENT
[2:41:17] PROPHET IF HE'S PROPHESYING,
[2:41:20] PREACHING, NOT TO TRY TO EDIFY HIMSELF,
[2:41:25] to make a BIG NAME OR TO EDIFY HIS
[2:41:28] ORGANIZATION.
[2:41:30] AMEN. He should be where he SHOULD BE IN
[2:41:32] AN ORGANIZATION.
[2:41:34] HERE I AM WITHOUT ONE. But yet
[2:41:36] preaching, YOU SHOULD BE
[2:41:39] YOU should be part of.
[2:41:41] THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY MAN OUGHT TO HAVE A
[2:41:44] CHURCH HOME.
[2:41:47] YOU OUGHT TO HAVE A PLACE
[2:41:50] NOT JUST TO FLOAT FROM PETER TO POP.
[2:41:55] TODAY YOU ARE HERE. NEXT WEEK YOU WERE
[2:41:58] THERE. THE OTHER WEEK YOU WERE THERE.
[2:42:01] THE OTHER WEEK YOU WERE THE OTHER SIDE.
[2:42:03] SO WHAT IS YOUR CHURCH? WHO IS YOUR
[2:42:05] PASTOR?
[2:42:09] YOU DON'T KNOW. YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
[2:42:12] [screaming] A BLESS
[2:42:14] NOT JUST TO FLOAT FROM A BAD PERIOD OF
[2:42:15] PASS.
[2:42:18] SOMEWHERE YOU PAY YOUR TITHES.
[2:42:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SOMEWHERE YOU
[2:42:25] YOU YOU PAY YOUR TITHES.
[2:42:28] SOMEWHERE THAT YOU HELP
[2:42:32] SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
[2:42:34] WE ARE COMING TO THAT.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE CAUSE? IT MEANS A MINISTRY
[2:42:40] OR A PART OF
[2:42:42] MUST HAVE A CAUSE
[2:42:44] MUST HAVE A VISION MUST HAVE SOMETHING
[2:42:47] THAT DRIVES THEM.
[2:42:50] WHAT I'VE SEEN IN MANY OF OUR CHURCHES
[2:42:54] LET ME NOT PUT IT THAT WAY
[2:42:56] UNDERSTOOD WHAT I'VE SEEN AMONG MANY
[2:42:58] BELIEVERS OF THIS MESSAGE.
[2:43:01] WE DON'T HAVE A CAUSE.
[2:43:04] WE ARE JUST RUNNING AIMLESS.
[2:43:06] WE'RE JUST PREACHING AND PREACHING AND
[2:43:08] PREACHING AND OTHER PEOPLE'S CAUSE IS
[2:43:10] JUST TO PREACH LAWS AND LOSS AND LAWS.
[2:43:15] Don't don't. AND THEN YOU WONDER WHAT'S
[2:43:17] THE CAUSE?
[2:43:19] WHAT'S THE VISION?
[2:43:21] WHAT'S THE ASSIGNMENT
[2:43:23] THAT WE AS A BODY OF BELIEVERS HAVE?
[2:43:27] AMEN. IF WE'RE PART OF A CHURCH, YOU
[2:43:30] MUST HAVE A CAUSE.
[2:43:32] AMEN.
[2:43:34] THAT THEY KNOW EVEN YOU GO [screaming]
[2:43:38] TO ANOTHER PLACE TO PREACH.
[2:43:41] YOU ARE WITHIN that same vision.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
[2:43:49] YOU HAVE TO [screaming] HAVE A CHURCH
[2:43:50] HOME.
[2:43:52] EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD WHERE THEY SUPPORT
[2:43:54] THE CAUSE.
[2:43:56] YOUR CHOICE.
[2:43:59] And I've put that in big capital
[2:44:00] letters.
[2:44:04] TAKE YOUR CHOICE.
[2:44:07] YOU SEE, YOU DON'T YOU CANNOT BE FORCED
[2:44:09] INTO A CHURCH.
[2:44:12] That's why you have TO TAKE A CHOICE
[2:44:15] BECAUSE REMEMBER YOU HAVE to believe in
[2:44:16] the cause of the church.
[2:44:20] BUT THEN DON'T NEVER DYSFELLOWSHIP THE
[2:44:22] [screaming] OTHER MAN
[2:44:24] BECAUSE HE DON'T BELONG TO YOUR GROUP.
[2:44:27] DISERN SPIRIT AND SEE IF HE'S GOT THE
[2:44:31] SAME PURPOSE IN HEART.
[2:44:35] Then you go TO FELLOWSHIP ONE WITH HIM.
[2:44:38] YOU ARE WORKING FOR ONE GREAT CAUSE.
[2:44:43] THAT'S THE CAUSE OF CHRIST.
[2:44:45] I think that's absolutely true. Now I
[2:44:48] want to TELL YOU CHURCH. GOD ALWAYS
[2:44:50] SENDS A PROPHET TO RUN WITH A VISION.
[2:44:56] If you preach or rather if you read a
[2:44:58] message Christ is the mystery of God
[2:44:59] revealed
[2:45:02] the cause of this hour,
[2:45:06] the cause, the vision.
[2:45:12] A New Testament preacher IS A PROPHET.
[2:45:16] EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD ACCEPT HEADSHIP.
[2:45:20] IN THIS MANNER. [screaming] YOU KNOW,
[2:45:22] YOU MUST HAVE A PROPHET TO GUIDE YOU.
[2:45:26] AMEN. IN YOUR LITTLE WORLD, IN YOUR
[2:45:27] LITTLE PLACE, WHEREVER YOU ARE,
[2:45:30] I'VE I've seen people who say, "Well,
[2:45:31] me, I'M AN EVANGELIST. I WORLD OVER,
[2:45:36] but they have no pastor.
[2:45:39] They don't pay tither anywhere.
[2:45:41] WATCH TELEVISION.
[2:45:44] ALL MONEY YOU PAY IN TAXES
[2:45:47] IS NOT TO ENRICH ME.
[2:45:49] IT IS TO SUPPORT THE CAUSE WE AS A
[2:45:51] CHURCH ARE STANDING FOR
[2:45:55] YOUR OBLIGATION AS A MEMBER OF THE BODY
[2:46:00] TO SUPPORT THAT VISION
[2:46:02] BY PAYING YOUR TITHING.
[2:46:05] THAT'S WHY GOD SAID IF YOU DON'T PAY
[2:46:06] YOUR TITH
[2:46:08] YOU ARE A ROBBER.
[2:46:10] YOU'RE MAKING THE WORK OF GOD DIFFICULT.
[2:46:13] YOU'RE DEFEATING [screaming] THE CAUSE.
[2:46:16] YOU'RE MAKING US LAG BEHIND.
[2:46:20] EVERY CHRISTIAN MUST SPARE THEIR TITLES,
[2:46:24] including the pastor.
[2:46:29] Praise God.
[2:46:31] Every believer, you know, well, I'll not
[2:46:33] go there. EVERY BELIEVER SHOULD ACCEPT
[2:46:35] HEADSHIP IN THIS.
[2:46:37] IT IS A PROGRAM OF GOD.
[2:46:40] THE SPIRITUAL HEADSHIP
[2:46:42] YOU ARE UNDER MUST HAVE A VISION.
[2:46:47] IT MUST HAVE A CAUSE.
[2:46:49] IT MUST HAVE A MANDATE.
[2:46:52] YES, I UNDERSTAND ALL PREACHERS ARE
[2:46:54] SERVANTS OF GOD.
[2:46:56] BUT WHAT IS THE CAUSE?
[2:47:00] THE ASSIGNMENT GOD HAS PLACED IN THE
[2:47:01] HEART
[2:47:04] of a man of God, of a pastor.
[2:47:08] you have submitted yourself to
[2:47:13] what is that mandate he has
[2:47:20] before YOU MAKE A CHOICE THAT SHOULD BE
[2:47:22] THE MOTIVATION
[2:47:30] I saw
[2:47:32] the man that mentored me in this message
[2:47:37] you No, he accomplished a lot in his
[2:47:40] lifetime.
[2:47:43] Built a large church,
[2:47:46] beautiful building in the 80s,
[2:47:50] beautiful building even to the present
[2:47:53] day.
[2:47:56] But if they tell you the history,
[2:48:00] it was not easy. But the people believed
[2:48:03] in his vision,
[2:48:06] STOOD BEHIND IT.
[2:48:07] SUPPORTED THAT WORK WITH ONE HEART
[2:48:12] BECAUSE they saw his money.
[2:48:16] He's built a school
[2:48:19] have a large campground
[2:48:23] acres and acres. This was not done in
[2:48:25] one year, TWO YEARS, THREE YEARS, MANY
[2:48:28] YEARS OF A COMMITTED MAN and people that
[2:48:33] supported that vision.
[2:48:36] THAT'S HOW GOD WORKS.
[2:48:38] But what was his vision? And I'm glad
[2:48:41] his vision I realized many years ago. I
[2:48:45] made it my vision.
[2:48:48] HIS VISION WAS TO SEND THIS MESSAGE
[2:48:53] TO EVERY TRIBE TO EVERY TOWN AND WHOEVER
[2:48:56] CAN LET THEM.
[2:49:00] WHY? If you believe THIS IS A WORD OF
[2:49:03] GOD FOR THIS DAY, THEN OUR generation
[2:49:06] needs.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; And then when PEOPLE PAY THEIR TITHES,
[2:49:13] and I can tell you DVF,
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER YOU PAY YOUR TITHE, YOU CAN BE
[2:49:18] 100% SURE
[2:49:21] almost more than 100 of what you GAIN
[2:49:26] goes to the work of God,
[2:49:29] goes to support that view.
[2:49:33] Amen.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want mixers.
[2:49:38] HE WANTS SEPARATE.
[2:49:40] SEPARATE ME PAUL and and and Barnabas.
[2:49:43] Separate yourself from the things OF
[2:49:44] GOD.
[2:49:46] GOD HAVE MERCY. GIVE US SOME OLD TIME
[2:49:49] PREACHERS THAT WILL PREACH THE
[2:49:51] GOSPEL.
[2:49:55] CALL BLACK AND WHITE WHITE.
[2:49:59] and lay the gospel WHERE IT WILL.
[2:50:02] AS JOHN THE BAPTIST SAID, THE AX IS LAID
[2:50:06] to the root of THE TREE.
[2:50:09] GIVE US MORE PREACHERS LIKE THAT.
[2:50:12] WE WILL GET BACK TO GOD'S WAY ABOUT
[2:50:14] THINGS.
[2:50:16] THAT'S WHAT WE WANT FRIENDS. AMEN. EVEN
[2:50:19] IN THIS CHURCH, MAY GOD RAISE PREACHERS
[2:50:22] THAT WILL CALL BLACK
[2:50:26] WHITE AND WILL PREACH THE WORD WITHOUT
[2:50:28] SUFFERING.
[2:50:30] AND YOU KNOW WHAT? BECAUSE THEY KNOW
[2:50:32] THEY HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT.
[2:50:35] THEY DON'T fear to make anybody angry.
[2:50:37] IF YOU KNOW YOU ARE INSPIRED,
[2:50:40] LET ME TELL YOU. LET ME TELL YOU RIGHT
[2:50:41] HERE. I HAVE NEVER PREACHED ANYTHING
[2:50:43] HERE BEHIND THE PULL pit because I know
[2:50:46] someone's experiencing.
[2:50:50] If I KNOW YOU'RE EXPERIENCING SOMETHING,
[2:50:52] I will never preach about it. I will
[2:50:54] WAIT IN THE FUTURE. GOD GIVES ME
[2:50:56] ANOINTING FOR IT.
[2:50:59] BUT BEFORE THEN I CANNOT. WHY? BECAUSE
[2:51:02] THEN THAT WILL BE CANO.
[2:51:06] YOU SEE I HAVE TO PREACH INSPIRATION.
[2:51:09] I'M TELLING YOU CHURCH. IF YOU EVER HEAR
[2:51:11] ME PREACHING ANYTHING
[2:51:13] AND YOUR FEAR IS EXPOSING YOU,
[2:51:16] THAT IS BECAUSE GOD HIMSELF HAS DESIGNED
[2:51:19] YOUR HEART.
[2:51:22] I may not EVEN REMEMBER WHAT HE TOLD ME.
[2:51:26] I'M JUST PREACHING MY HEART
[2:51:28] BECAUSE IT'S AN assignment God has given
[2:51:31] and in questions and answers HE SAYS WE
[2:51:34] BELIEVE IN CHURCH GOVERNMENT
[2:51:36] AND THE GOVERNMENT IS ORDERED OF THE
[2:51:38] HOLY SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE.
[2:51:41] THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS THE HEAD OF THE
[2:51:43] CHURCH.
[2:51:45] THE PASTOR IS ALWAYS
[2:51:48] THAT IS God is elder.
[2:51:50] IN ORGANIZATIONS YOU HAVE TO COME
[2:51:53] THROUGH THE BISHOP.
[2:51:55] THERE IS NO HIGHER [screaming] ORDER IN
[2:51:56] THE BIBLE THAN THE ELDER OF THE CHURCH.
[2:52:02] Just tell ME WHERE IT'S AT. THERE'S NO
[2:52:05] HIGHER ORDER IN THE BIBLE FOR THE CHURCH
[2:52:07] THAN THE elder which is the pastor. HE'S
[2:52:10] THE HIGHEST ORDER
[2:52:13] OF THE BIBLE. Now don't receive any
[2:52:16] accusation against your elder.
[2:52:22] No brother, don't receive any
[2:52:24] accusation.
[2:52:28] Find the word for accusation UNLESS IT
[2:52:31] IT FIRST BE BY TWO OR THREE WITNESSES.
[2:52:37] WELL, you can call it.
[2:52:43] NO MATTER WHAT ANYBODY SAYS ABOUT,
[2:52:49] this is no way talking ABOUT ME.
[2:52:50] SOMEBODY SEE AS A CHILD.
[2:52:54] DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT UNTIL YOU HAVE
[2:52:57] TWO OR THREE WITNESSES?
[2:53:00] WHY WOULD [screaming] GOD SAY THIS?
[2:53:03] BECAUSE IF THE PASTOR IS STRUCK,
[2:53:07] THE WHOLE FLOCK WILL FEEL IT.
[2:53:12] IF ONE MAN BEGINS TO RUN OUT WITH A LOT
[2:53:14] OF GOSSIP ABOUT THE
[2:53:18] REVIVAL WILL DIE.
[2:53:21] PEOPLE'S HEARTS WILL BE WILL BE LIKE
[2:53:23] STONE.
[2:53:26] THE PASTOR CAN NO LONGER HELP THEM.
[2:53:30] WE HAVE SO MANY CHURCHES LIKE THAT
[2:53:33] WHERE THE PASTOR CANNOT EVEN PREACH
[2:53:35] ANYTHING AND PEOPLE RECEIVE IT
[2:53:38] BECAUSE OF SO MUCH GOSSIP IN THE CHURCH.
[2:53:42] SO THEN GOD HAS A STANDARD.
[2:53:45] SOMEONE COMES WITH GOSSIP
[2:53:48] BECAUSE GOD IS PROTECTING THE VISION.
[2:53:51] HE SAYS, "DON'T YOU RECEIVE IT.
[2:53:54] DON'T [screaming] YOU RECEIVE IT?
[2:53:57] BUT IF YOU WANT TO GIVE IT A CHANCE
[2:54:00] HAVE TWO WITNESSES, HAVE THREE
[2:54:02] WITNESSES. AND THESE ONES MUST FIRST BE
[2:54:06] PROVED."
[2:54:11] WHY IS GOD DOING THAT?
[2:54:13] IT'S NOT ABOUT THE MAN.
[2:54:15] IT'S ABOUT THE OFFICE. THE OFFICE IS A
[2:54:18] CUSTODIAN OF THE VISION.
[2:54:24] WHEN ANYONE GOES AGAINST THE PASTOR OF
[2:54:26] ANY CHURCH, LET ME TELL YOU THAT PERSON,
[2:54:28] THAT PERSON IS ANOINTED BY THE DEVIL TO
[2:54:30] DESTROY THE VISION.
[2:54:37] IF YOU EVER FEEL AT ANY TIME AND I KNOW
[2:54:41] WE HAVE SOME VISITORS HERE AND PROBABLY
[2:54:43] SOME OTHER PEOPLE STREAMING, WE HEAR
[2:54:46] FROM THEM FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD. SO
[2:54:48] THIS IS NOT ONLY FOR YOU. SOMETIMES IF
[2:54:51] YOU EVER FEEL YOU ARE NOT COMFORTABLE
[2:54:55] WITH YOUR PASTOR, YOU'RE NOT SATISFIED.
[2:54:58] LET ME TELL YOU, FIND ANOTHER CHURCH.
[2:55:01] BUT DON'T YOU [screaming] EVER CAUSE
[2:55:03] TROUBLE
[2:55:04] IN A LOCAL BODY OF BELIEVERS
[2:55:07] BECAUSE GOD WILL HOLD [screaming] YOU
[2:55:09] RESPONSIBLE
[2:55:13] AND LET THEM WITNESSES BE TRIED FAST.
[2:55:17] AND THEN IF THAT ELDER HAS DONE
[2:55:19] SOMETHING WRONG,
[2:55:21] THEN THESE THREE HOLY GHOST WITNESSES
[2:55:26] HAS BEEN TRIED AND PROVEN THAT THEY'VE
[2:55:29] REALLY DONE SOMETHING TO THE ELDER,
[2:55:33] then go to the elder
[2:55:35] and that
[2:55:37] sin openly rebuke
[2:55:42] so that others may see and take heed
[2:55:46] way.
[2:55:47] YOU CANNOT LIVE ANY HIGHER THAN YOUR
[2:55:48] PASTOR. HE says
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; how the angel came to me.
[2:55:53] &gt;&gt; All right. Please brothers give me a few
[2:55:54] moments. I need to conclude this IN ONE
[2:55:57] SERMON. NOW I BELIEVE MOSTLY MOSTLY TO
[2:55:59] BLAME and not to blame but mostly is the
[2:56:02] way the people are taught
[2:56:07] AND THE CHURCH WILL NEVER LIVE HIGHER
[2:56:09] [screaming]
[2:56:10] THAN ITS PASTOR TEACHES.
[2:56:15] You seldom FIND THAT.
[2:56:18] IF YOU GOT A GOOD SOUND, SAINT GOSPEL
[2:56:20] TEACHER,
[2:56:23] YOU WILL USUALLY FIND THAT TYPE OF
[2:56:25] CHURCH,
[2:56:27] you will usually FIND IT. AND IT'S JUST
[2:56:30] WHERE YOUR pastor leads you,
[2:56:34] the pastor that feeds you.
[2:56:37] You see, whatever your PASTOR FEEDS YOU
[2:56:41] WILL BE YOUR MAKEUP.
[2:56:43] IF HE'S THE KIND THAT IS THE GUY THAT
[2:56:45] RUNS DOWN EVERYONE AND DISRESPECTS
[2:56:47] EVERYONE,
[2:56:50] you will find that spirit on the
[2:56:51] people's feet.
[2:56:54] That's why brother Bham says pastor,
[2:56:57] sorry, churches carry spirits.
[2:57:01] That's why you should not just go to
[2:57:02] every church.
[2:57:04] Churches carry spirits.
[2:57:07] Before you try to go to a church,
[2:57:11] even when you travel somewhere
[2:57:13] in a town or in a distance in a country,
[2:57:17] text your pastor, call him,
[2:57:19] ask, "Do we have a church around?"
[2:57:22] DON'T ASK FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS.
[2:57:25] FIND about your what you're going TO
[2:57:26] FEED ON.
[2:57:28] BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU GO IN A CHURCH one
[2:57:30] time, YOU FIND THE PASTOR has this
[2:57:33] critical SPIRIT ON HIM.
[2:57:37] CRITICAL
[2:57:39] CRITICAL critical critical CRITICIZING
[2:57:43] talking bad about my other pastor.
[2:57:48] FIND THE PEOPLE ARE THE SAME WAY
[2:57:53] SAME SAME WAY
[2:57:56] THEY TALK AGAINST MEN OF GOD
[2:57:59] EVEN ON WHATSAPP THEY DON'T RESPECT MEN
[2:58:01] OF GOD BEFORE I COMMENT
[2:58:05] I ALWAYS look at that person where does
[2:58:06] he go to church
[2:58:10] then I'm surprised
[2:58:13] YOU GET THE ISSUE THIS IS WHAT IT IS
[2:58:15] BROTHER IS TELLING
[2:58:17] YOU CANNOT LIVE ANY HIGHER THAN YOUR
[2:58:19] PASTOR. HOW HE FEEDS YOU, HOW HE
[2:58:26] takes the word seriously,
[2:58:29] YOU WILL TAKE IT SERIOUSLY.
[2:58:31] IF HE MISINTERPRETS THE WORD,
[2:58:34] YOU WILL INTER M. SO IT IS IMPORTANT WHO
[2:58:38] FITS YOU.
[2:58:41] [cheering]
[2:58:42] In Christ is the myster of God revealed.
[2:58:46] HE SAYS LOVE ONE ANOTHER ABOVE
[2:58:47] EVERYTHING.
[2:58:50] Love one another. Don't don't no matter
[2:58:51] WHAT THE DEVIL TRIES TO SAY,
[2:58:54] YOU ARE NOW GOING TO GET BIG SWEET
[2:58:55] GROUP.
[2:58:57] BUT REMEMBER MY WARNING. S WON'T LET
[2:59:00] THAT STAY THAT WAY.
[2:59:02] HE WILL SHOOT EVERYTHING.
[2:59:05] IF HE HAS TO BRING SOMEONE TO MAKE THAT
[2:59:06] TARGET,
[2:59:08] HE WILL BRING some critical OR
[2:59:12] he will sit him down and he cause him to
[2:59:14] fellowship with you
[2:59:17] under the quietness AND THINGS.
[2:59:20] THEN HE WILL SHOOT THAT GUY
[2:59:22] WITH SOME KIND OF POISON STUFF
[2:59:26] AND THAT GUY WILL RUN AND START THROWING
[2:59:28] THE CHURCH WITH HIM.
[2:59:34] Are you not seeing these days? The
[2:59:37] pastor has a problem.
[2:59:39] Give me the ministry
[2:59:41] things are sick.
[2:59:43] What do you see?
[2:59:46] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:59:49] Brother Wa told me the church is sick.
[2:59:53] These people are short have a shot from
[2:59:56] the death.
[3:00:01] See the prophet told us amen well if you
[3:00:04] don't have that spirit you will be
[3:00:06] saying amen and rejoicing.
[3:00:09] &gt;&gt; And if you have it say amen and let it
[3:00:11] go
[3:00:14] what without some kind of stuff and you
[3:00:16] will start you know don't you take s
[3:00:17] with it.
[3:00:21] Don't you have NOTHING TO DO WITH
[3:00:23] ANYTHING ELSE.
[3:00:26] YOU STAY RIGHT LOVING AND SWEET AND KIND
[3:00:29] TO ONE ANOTHER.
[3:00:32] PRAY FOR THAT MAN THAT HE WILL BE SAVED
[3:00:35] TOO,
[3:00:37] THAT woman or WHOEVER IT IS. PRAY FOR
[3:00:40] THEM TO AND STICK ONE WITH ANOTHER
[3:00:44] AND STAY WITH YOUR PASTOR.
[3:00:46] HE IS THE SHEPHERD
[3:00:48] AND YOU GIVE HIM RESPECT.
[3:00:51] HE WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH. [screaming]
[3:00:54] HE WILL LEAD YOU THROUGH
[3:00:58] because he's ordained OF GOD
[3:01:01] TO DO SO. NOW, DO YOU REMEMBER THAT THE
[3:01:05] ENEMY WILL COME
[3:01:07] AND WHEN HE DOES CLING THAT MUCH CLOSER
[3:01:12] TOGETHER AND THE ONE THAT THE DEVIL IS
[3:01:14] USING [screaming] FOR HIS ENEMY
[3:01:17] WILL EITHER GET OUT OR HE WILL COME IN
[3:01:20] AND BE ONE OF YOU.
[3:01:24] THAT'S ALL. DON'T NEVER
[3:01:29] TALK. MAKE YOURSELF
[3:01:35] win the poor.
[3:01:39] WIN
[3:01:41] the
[3:01:45] win.
[3:01:48] We the JOTH
[3:01:53] [screaming] they don't LIKE US THEY
[3:01:55] SEPARATE
[3:01:56] WITH THE BLACK WITH THE BROWN WITH THE
[3:02:00] TOMBLING
[3:02:04] at a moment LIKE THIS
[3:02:06] STAND THERE AND LISTEN
[3:02:10] we who are like this
[3:02:13] we should never claim
[3:02:18] WE SHOULD BE ONE BIG STREET GROUP ALL
[3:02:21] THE TIME. [screaming]
[3:02:27] ALL RIGHT. NOW I'M COMING TO THE SERMON
[3:02:30] OF TODAY
[3:02:33] so I can close it.
[3:02:36] NOW AS THEY WERE GOING IN THE JOURNEY,
[3:02:41] OH MY MY
[3:02:44] COMES A BROTHER,
[3:02:47] THE SON OF IS
[3:02:49] AND
[3:02:52] THE BIBLE SAY THEY TOOK MEN
[3:02:54] AND THEY ROSE UP BEFORE MOSES
[3:02:57] WITH SOME CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,
[3:03:00] 250 PRINCES,
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; prince Prince,
[3:03:09] [screaming] famous in the congregation,
[3:03:12] MEN ARE RENOWN.
[3:03:15] THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF POLITICAL
[3:03:16] MANEUVERS.
[3:03:20] WHEN YOU WANT THE CHURCH TO FALL,
[3:03:24] ENTERTAIN POLITICAL MANEUVERS.
[3:03:31] THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WILL GO AROUND THE
[3:03:33] CHURCH
[3:03:35] WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE RESPECTED
[3:03:37] RESPECTABLE MEN OR WOMEN THEMSELVES.
[3:03:41] But then they BEGIN TO GO AROUND.
[3:03:44] THEY DON'T GO TO ANYBODY. THEY GO TO
[3:03:46] THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW THEY PAY BIG
[3:03:49] TES.
[3:03:53] THEY GO TO THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW ARE
[3:03:55] EDUCATED.
[3:03:57] THEY GO TO THOSE ONES WHO THEY KNOW CAN
[3:03:59] CAUSE A REVOLT.
[3:04:04] AND THEY CALLED 250
[3:04:07] NOT COMMON MEN BUT PRINCES
[3:04:14] men of reor
[3:04:17] and they GATHERED THEMSELVES TOGETHER
[3:04:18] AGAINST MOSES
[3:04:21] AND against Aaron. They said unto them,
[3:04:24] you take too much UPON YOURSELF,
[3:04:26] SEEING [screaming] ALL THE CONGREGATION
[3:04:28] ARE HOLY.
[3:04:30] EVERY ONE OF THEM AND THE LORD IS AMONG
[3:04:31] THEM.
[3:04:33] WHEREFORE THEN LIFT YOU UP YOURSELVES
[3:04:35] ABOVE THE CONGRE.
[3:04:38] And when MOSES HAD IT, HE FELL UPON HIS
[3:04:42] FACE. THIS IS A MAN WHO HIDE FROM GOD
[3:04:46] [screaming]
[3:04:48] THE VISION OF THE HOLY GH
[3:04:52] people who are only led or moved by
[3:04:56] political maneuvers.
[3:05:02] HE FELL UPON HIS FACE. AND HE SPAKE UNTO
[3:05:05] KORA,
[3:05:07] NOT STANDING, BUT FALLING DOWN
[3:05:12] and unto all his company,
[3:05:14] SAYING EVEN TOMORROW. THE LORD WILL
[3:05:18] [screaming] SHOW WHO ARE HIS
[3:05:20] AND WHO IS HOLY AND WILL CAUSE HIM TO
[3:05:24] COME NEAR UNTO HIM.
[3:05:26] Even him WHOM HE HAS CHOSEN WILL HE
[3:05:29] CAUSE TO COME NEAR UNTO HIM.
[3:05:33] YOU KNOW ABOUT ONE THING ABOUT A MAN OF
[3:05:34] GOD OR A WOMAN OF GOD.
[3:05:38] IF GOD CALLED YOU AND ONE RISES UP
[3:05:41] AGAINST YOU
[3:05:43] NEVER FIGHT THEM.
[3:05:45] NEVER ANSWER THEM. LET [screaming] GOD
[3:05:49] THE ONE WHO CALLED YOU
[3:05:52] FIGHT FOR YOU. ANSWER [screaming] FOR
[3:05:54] YOU.
[3:05:56] THAT'S THE characterism of a man that is
[3:05:58] called by God.
[3:06:01] this do.
[3:06:03] &gt;&gt; All right. And then and and and he says
[3:06:06] and put incense in them. Take take you
[3:06:09] know sensors and put incense in them.
[3:06:14] Sensors and put in them
[3:06:18] and before the Lord tomorrow and it
[3:06:21] shall be that the man whom the Lord does
[3:06:23] choose,
[3:06:26] he shall be holy.
[3:06:28] You take too much upon you.
[3:06:32] No, he's also telling them
[3:06:35] you take too much upon you.
[3:06:38] You sons of Levy.
[3:06:40] They were sons of Levy.
[3:06:43] But they were not priests.
[3:06:45] And he's telling them, you've taken too
[3:06:48] much upon him.
[3:06:51] THE THING YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS BEYOND
[3:06:53] your level. So let God prove.
[3:06:57] And Moses SAID UNTO KORA, "HERE I PRAY
[3:07:00] YOU,
[3:07:02] sons of Levi," she may fit but a small
[3:07:04] thing unto you,
[3:07:07] THAT GOD of Israel has separated you
[3:07:09] from the congregation of ISRAEL
[3:07:12] to bring you near to himself to
[3:07:13] yourself, the tabernacle of the Lord
[3:07:16] to stand before the congregation to
[3:07:17] minister to them.
[3:07:23] Do not despise the office God HAS PLACED
[3:07:25] YOU IN.
[3:07:27] AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE ONE, quickly pray
[3:07:30] and find one.
[3:07:33] You need to FIND WHERE YOU BELONG
[3:07:36] HOW YOU SUPPORT THE CAUSE.
[3:07:38] Can I have a resounding amen on that?
[3:07:41] You see, he says, "And he has brought
[3:07:43] near unto him."
[3:07:45] Please church, just pardon me. Give me
[3:07:48] grace. Let me finish.
[3:07:50] See, but a small thing unto you. Okay.
[3:07:52] All right. I finish that now. says, "And
[3:07:53] he has brought thee near to him,
[3:07:57] and all thy brethren, the sons of Levi
[3:07:59] with thee,
[3:08:01] seek ye the priesthood also,
[3:08:05] for which cause both thou and all thy
[3:08:07] company are gathered together against
[3:08:08] the law.
[3:08:14] And what is Aaron?"
[3:08:16] The imam against him. And Moses sent to
[3:08:19] call and Abraham the son OF
[3:08:23] HE SAID, "BRING THEM TO ME HERE."
[3:08:26] AND THEY SAID, "We will not go.
[3:08:31] PASTOR IS CALLING US, we will not go."
[3:08:35] And he said, "IS IT A SMALL THING THAT
[3:08:38] THOU HAS BROUGHT US OUT OF THE LAND THAT
[3:08:40] FLOWTH WITH MILK AND HONEY?"
[3:08:44] This is their complaint.
[3:08:48] TO KILL US IN THE WILDERNESS EXCEPT you
[3:08:52] you have already only made thyself
[3:08:54] altogether a prince over us.
[3:09:00] MOREOVER, THOU HAS NOT BROUGHT US INTO A
[3:09:02] LAND THAT FLOWTH MILK AND HONEY.
[3:09:06] NOT GIVEN US INHERITANCE OF THE FIELD
[3:09:08] AND VENIENT.
[3:09:13] Will thou put out THE EYES OF THIS MAN?
[3:09:17] WILL YOU PUT OUT THEIR eyes if you don't
[3:09:18] come?
[3:09:22] If we don't come, he had called them.
[3:09:26] We will not come.
[3:09:30] If we don't come, will you remove our
[3:09:32] eyes?
[3:09:34] We will not come. You can imagine such
[3:09:36] contempt.
[3:09:38] AND MOSES WAS VERY RO AND HE SAID UNTO
[3:09:41] THE LORD
[3:09:43] GO [screaming]
[3:09:44] RESPECT NOT THOU THEIR OFFERING.
[3:09:51] When I read that I said
[3:09:54] so the prayers of our pastor matter
[3:09:59] don't ever put a man of God
[3:10:02] in any situation
[3:10:04] to pray such a prayer on you.
[3:10:10] I'm telling you, I have not taken one us
[3:10:13] from them. May have hurt one of them
[3:10:17] unto
[3:10:18] be thou and all like company before the
[3:10:20] Lord that they said unto Mora and take
[3:10:22] every All right, let me just go down
[3:10:24] because of time verses 20.
[3:10:27] And the Lord came down of course and he
[3:10:29] spake unto Moses
[3:10:31] and unto Aaron SAYING
[3:10:35] yourselves
[3:10:36] from among the congregation that I may
[3:10:39] consume them in a moment.
[3:10:42] You see HOW GOD WAS ANGRY.
[3:10:44] He wanted to KILL THESE PEOPLE
[3:10:47] in a moment.
[3:10:49] But you see, Moses had a heart of a
[3:10:53] he said, "No, God, don't do it.
[3:10:55] Don't do it.
[3:10:57] God didn't do it."
[3:10:59] But he did it.
[3:11:03] If God makes up his mind to do
[3:11:05] something,
[3:11:08] They didn't die in a moment,
[3:11:10] but they died over a period of time.
[3:11:15] Only their children made it to the
[3:11:16] promised land.
[3:11:25] Vers 30, I'm reaching the climax now.
[3:11:29] But if the Lord make a new thing
[3:11:33] and the earth open, mouth
[3:11:37] and swallow them up
[3:11:41] with all that pertainth unto them.
[3:11:44] And they go down quick INTO THE PIT.
[3:11:47] THEN YOU SHALL UNDERSTAND [screaming]
[3:11:50] THAT THESE MEN ARE provoked the Lord.
[3:11:53] And it came to pass as he had made an
[3:11:55] end OF THE SPEAKING OF THIS WORD
[3:11:58] THAT THE GROUND CLEVER
[3:12:02] that was under them.
[3:12:06] And the earth opened that mouth
[3:12:11] swallowed them
[3:12:13] and the HOUSES AND ALL THE MEN THAT
[3:12:16] PERTAIN UNTO KORA AND ALL THEIR
[3:12:21] AND ALL THAT PERTAIN TO THEM.
[3:12:24] THEY WENT DOWN ALIVE INTO THE PIT,
[3:12:29] and their eyes closed upon,
[3:12:32] AND THEY PERISHED AMONG THE CANADIANS.
[3:12:33] [screaming]
[3:12:35] And all Israel THAT WERE AROUND ABOUT
[3:12:37] THEM FLED
[3:12:41] the cry of them.
[3:12:43] They say, "Lest the earth swallow us
[3:12:45] upwards."
[3:12:47] AND I CAME OUT OF FIRE FROM THE LORD.
[3:12:50] I CONSUMED THE 250 MEN THAT OFFERED IN
[3:12:58] Abraham
[3:13:00] try to do political maneuvers in the
[3:13:02] congregation.
[3:13:06] THEY SOUGHT FOR POWER
[3:13:08] INSTEAD OF A mission or mandate from the
[3:13:10] Lord.
[3:13:13] See how the people perished.
[3:13:15] See how the Lord stopped moving them
[3:13:17] into the direction of fulfilling the
[3:13:18] word.
[3:13:22] these people CONTINUED CIRCLING IN THE
[3:13:23] DESERT FOR YEARS.
[3:13:28] ALL BECAUSE OF MEN ANOINTED BY SATAN
[3:13:34] that obscur their vision
[3:13:38] by political maneuvers
[3:13:43] them lose focus
[3:13:47] on the vision.
[3:13:50] God has given us a vision.
[3:13:54] We should stay the course.
[3:13:58] Brother Bam then goes ahead. I'm not
[3:14:00] quoted because of time in a Theian
[3:14:02] church age. You can go and read it
[3:14:07] in the church age book. talks about
[3:14:10] Jezebel
[3:14:11] and how you know should you know how I
[3:14:14] have married Jezebel
[3:14:17] and he did some political maneuvers
[3:14:22] to strengthen his kingdom and secure it
[3:14:26] and that's exactly what the church did
[3:14:28] under Emperor Constantine
[3:14:33] Constantin
[3:14:34] THEY UNITED THEY FORMED THE COUNCIL
[3:14:39] THAT'S WHAT THE CHURCH HAS DONE TODAY.
[3:14:42] YOU SEE THE KINDS OF CHURCHES. IT'S A
[3:14:44] POLITICAL MANEUVER.
[3:14:49] God is not in it.
[3:14:51] That's why we are not part of any
[3:14:52] denomination.
[3:14:55] That's how we HAVE HEARD A MESSAGE.
[3:14:58] COME OUT [screaming] OF MY PEOPLE
[3:15:00] BE NOT PARTAKERS OF OUR SINS.
[3:15:03] AND WE ARE OUT OF the
[3:15:06] we are not going to be a part of it.
[3:15:08] God is calling a bride.
[3:15:11] Prepare her
[3:15:13] for the coming king.
[3:15:15] But where are you? Which side are you on
[3:15:20] as the musicians come please?
[3:15:23] It was con conser idea
[3:15:26] to get everyone together
[3:15:28] pagans and nominal Christians and true
[3:15:30] Christians.
[3:15:34] And for a while it looked like it WOULD
[3:15:36] BE SUCCEED.
[3:15:39] BUT THE REAL BELIEVERS CAME ALONG TO SEE
[3:15:40] if they could bring back the ones that
[3:15:42] had drifted away from them.
[3:15:47] But when they saw THAT THEY COULDN'T
[3:15:48] BRING THEM BACK INTO THE TRUTH,
[3:15:51] they were forced to break away
[3:15:54] from the body political.
[3:15:58] Then when they did, they were called
[3:16:01] heretics
[3:16:03] and they were persecuted.
[3:16:06] Let me say this right here that we have
[3:16:08] the very same thing going on right now.
[3:16:12] The people are all coming together.
[3:16:15] They are writing a Bible that will suit
[3:16:17] everyone whether it is a be a Jew or
[3:16:19] Catholic or Protestant.
[3:16:25] I say they have already written it.
[3:16:28] They have their own SIN COUNCIL BUT THEY
[3:16:30] CALL IT the ecumenical council.
[3:16:37] begin to pray softly and do you know
[3:16:40] whom all these organizations FIGHT
[3:16:43] THEY FIGHT THE TRUE PENTECOSTALS
[3:16:47] I don't mean the organization CALLED
[3:16:48] PENTECOSTALS
[3:16:50] I MEAN THE ONES WHO ARE PENTECOSTAL
[3:16:52] BECAUSE THEY ARE FILLED WITH THE HOLY
[3:16:53] [screaming] GHOST
[3:16:56] AND THEY HAVE SIGNS AND GIFT
[3:16:59] IN THEIR midst because they WALK IN
[3:17:01] TRUTH
[3:17:05] JEZEBEL SPIRIT IS STILL HUNTING US
[3:17:08] TODAY.
[3:17:10] BROTHER, let's keep our eyes
[3:17:15] on the vision.
[3:17:18] We did not come TO PLAY.
[3:17:21] We are human beings filled with a lot of
[3:17:24] insufficiencies
[3:17:26] both you and I. But you know what? Each
[3:17:30] of us has a different assignment
[3:17:34] in the body of Christ.
[3:17:38] Find your mission.
[3:17:41] Find your assignment.
[3:17:43] CATCH THE VISION
[3:17:45] AND AS ONE BODY. LET'S CARRY ON. LET'S
[3:17:50] PUSH FORWARD. WHATEVER WE NEED TO DO IN
[3:17:53] OUR GENERATION, LET'S DO IT.
[3:17:57] LET ME TELL YOU FRIENDS, I AM
[3:17:58] DETERMINED.
[3:17:59] WHETHER I STAND WITH TWO OR THREE
[3:18:02] [screaming] VERY DETERMINED
[3:18:04] YOUNG MEN or or ladies,
[3:18:07] we are going to do this.
[3:18:09] We are GOING TO DO THIS. WE HAVE A WORK
[3:18:12] TO DO.
[3:18:14] WE HAVE A GENERATION TO REACH TO.
[3:18:16] ARE YOU HEARING ME CHURCH? WE ARE NOT
[3:18:19] JUST HERE TO WASTE TIME.
[3:18:22] LET'S BE BURDENED.
[3:18:25] Let's be focused.
[3:18:27] is attending church.
[3:18:30] LET'S BE COMMITTED.
[3:18:32] LET'S BE REAL GENTLEMEN AND women of the
[3:18:34] gospel
[3:18:36] paying tithes. LET'S REALLY MEAN
[3:18:39] OFFERINGS, land fund, whatever it is
[3:18:42] THAT WE ARE DOING SUPPORTING THE SAME
[3:18:45] VISION.
[3:18:47] Let's do it friends.
[3:18:51] And then when the battle is over,
[3:18:54] we will wear a crown.
[3:18:57] Hallelujah.
[3:18:59] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I know brother Shalom
[3:19:03] has exams at 2, so
[3:19:06] he's probably leaving shortly.
[3:19:10] It's all right if you have to go. It's
[3:19:11] all right. But friends,
[3:19:14] it's a very moment for us.
[3:19:18] [singing]
[3:19:19] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[3:19:42] institutions of higher learning,
[3:19:45] universities and they're doing exams and
[3:19:47] others. Let's going to remember them in
[3:19:49] prayer.
[3:19:51] But friends, we're living in a moment.
[3:19:53] [music]
[3:19:54] where the world is dying. There's many
[3:19:57] things happening around us.
[3:20:00] If we give in
[3:20:02] then we've given up and it will swallow
[3:20:05] us. But what would you be remembered?
[3:20:11] What have you done?
[3:20:14] What have you done in your generation?
[3:20:17] What are you doing IN YOUR SEASON?
[3:20:20] WHO ARE YOU? Are you a Moses? Are you an
[3:20:24] Aaron or you are an Abraham?
[3:20:28] Who are you?
[3:20:30] Are you Pharaoh
[3:20:33] or are you one of the children of
[3:20:34] Israel?
[3:20:36] Are you among the princes that came
[3:20:37] against the man of God?
[3:20:41] Are you among those that ran out from
[3:20:43] among those and said, "We don't want to
[3:20:44] be swallowed up.
[3:20:49] Where are you?
[3:20:51] Who are you? What are you doing in this
[3:20:53] place?
[3:20:54] If God has planted you
[3:20:57] even in this little ministry called me,
[3:21:01] just a little bit of of what God is
[3:21:03] doing all over,
[3:21:06] but he has planted you here
[3:21:09] for a purpose. I've never invited any of
[3:21:12] you.
[3:21:15] But God
[3:21:17] knew that you would be here and he has
[3:21:20] planted you here.
[3:21:22] for a purpose.
[3:21:25] What would you have him do for you?
[3:21:32] What would you have him do for you?
[3:21:35] Things might not have been going well
[3:21:38] in your life, but friends, shake it off.
[3:21:41] Let's check it off.
[3:21:44] Let's focus on the vision.
[3:21:51] Let's focus on the cause.
[3:21:54] The cause of Christ.
[3:21:57] THE HOUR IS LATE.
[3:21:59] THE TIME IS PASSED.
[3:22:02] No more time for PLAYING CHILDREN.
[3:22:05] WE'RE NO LONGER CHILDREN
[3:22:07] GOING TO BE TOSSED TO and fro.
[3:22:09] We want to be real men of purpose,
[3:22:13] real women.
[3:22:19] If you're married woman or married man,
[3:22:23] what are you doing
[3:22:25] in your pace? If you're single, your
[3:22:29] mother, whoever you are, WHATEVER YOU
[3:22:30] ARE,
[3:22:32] GOD HAS BLESSED YOU.
[3:22:34] What are you doing?
[3:22:37] It's getting too late for us.
[3:22:40] Christ is about to come back again.
[3:22:44] There's a lot we have to do, friends.
[3:22:46] We have to be focused on the vision.
[3:22:49] Let's stay focused on the vision.
[3:22:53] Oh Jesus.
[3:22:55] Friends, there's a presence of the Holy
[3:22:56] Ghost here.

[3:23:01] that you have received his word
[3:23:04] and he wants to re to receive you. He
[3:23:07] wants to bless you. Whatever is not
[3:23:10] going right in your life,

[4:05:34] Maybe just to announce to you as a
[4:05:35] church
[4:05:37] uh the the the office called me

[4:05:46] the owners of the land
[4:05:48] the the [music] sellers of the land
[4:05:51] and I they called me when I was in

[4:06:20] to give a little more
[4:06:23] this week. [music]
[4:06:25] Um, I would really appreciate that. I'm
[4:06:28] saying like a little more in millions.
[4:06:35] If you can borrow to go for a funeral,
[4:06:41] then you can surely do even more for the
[4:06:43] work.
[4:06:46] So we need nine more millions
[4:06:49] to pay the down payment. I think we have
[4:06:50] even we are passed the deadline two
[4:06:52] weeks. [music]
[4:06:55] Remember we have to pay 30 millions
[4:06:59] four times. So the first time is
[4:07:01] supposed to be
[4:07:04] and [music] so I appreciate if you can
[4:07:07] be able to uh do something and let us
[4:07:10] have a little more
[4:07:14] if you can make 25 then we can talk with
[4:07:16] the man.

[4:07:43] So if you want to go to that convention,
[4:07:49] come and get them.

[4:08:10] it yet.
[4:08:13] But uh so I'm sorry if they've not
[4:08:15] announced it yet.
[4:08:20] So but uh you know we we as a church
[4:08:22] should plan to be there

[4:08:42] things but those codes I saw brother
[4:08:44] Isaac they lost. You cannot rescan them

[4:08:56] but uh you need to [music] put for the
[4:08:58] people the website here. Do you have the
[4:08:59] website? Can you

[4:09:07] Can you come and put internet here so we
[4:09:08] can

[4:09:12] people how to
[4:09:18] let him sing a song one song
