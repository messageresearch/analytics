[54:29] brother brother
[54:32] uh Joel song reading this morning
[54:37] we have younger men coming up
[54:41] not only in song
[54:45] it's just one of them
[54:49] God is doing something
[54:52] you know when you see young men raising
[54:55] to the challenge of the ministry
[55:00] then you know they are feeding on the
[55:02] world
[55:03] I think this is the most important thing
[55:06] you can ever do in this life
[55:15] all the rest is not important
[55:33] some people think that in heaven it
[55:35] shall all be the same time
[55:39] we shall be the same in the sense that
[55:41] we shall all be redeemed
[55:45] but we shall not be the same in the
[55:48] sense that our Glory will be different
[55:50] foreign
[55:56] [Music]
[56:43] [Music]
[57:41] sometimes we say oh yeah Christ has been
[57:44] judged for us
[57:47] we will not be judged
[57:50] is true it is true in the sense that we
[57:53] shall not go in the word front judgments
[57:58] because the words
[58:01] is a place where decision is made
[58:05] whether or not you get eternal life
[58:08] but for the children of God we have
[58:12] already got eternal life
[58:14] by receiving Jesus Christ and by
[58:18] receiving the Holy Ghost the blood of
[58:21] Jesus Christ
[58:22] gives us eternal life
[58:24] we are not going to walk in that
[58:26] judgment
[58:28] where we shall where decision will have
[58:31] to be made whether or not to get eternal
[58:32] life
[58:36] because for us
[58:42] to walk into the Judgment seat of Christ
[58:47] [Music]
[58:50] foreign
[59:03] [Music]
[59:59] eternity
[59:59] [Music]
[1:00:03] the glory that we have received by doing
[1:00:07] what we have done for the Lord
[1:00:10] praise the name of the Lord
[1:00:14] oh my that was just a bonus
[1:00:17] so let us go into our sharing for this
[1:00:20] morning
[1:00:22] and when he had said this
[1:00:27] he breathed on them
[1:00:31] and said unto them
[1:00:34] receive ye the holy ghosts
[1:00:48] I was
[1:00:51] you know after overnight and
[1:00:54] we went to look at uh to to help Sister
[1:00:57] Rose and
[1:00:58] then I did have enough time to rest or
[1:01:00] to study but but
[1:01:04] um
[1:01:07] so last night again I did not rest
[1:01:11] because I was waiting upon the Lord
[1:01:17] this is um not because a minister does
[1:01:20] not usually have what to talk about
[1:01:24] there is a lot in this Bible Bible
[1:01:28] verse
[1:01:32] about it but you see it is not that way
[1:01:38] those of you who Minister know what I'm
[1:01:40] talking about
[1:01:41] you know you have to wait on the Lord
[1:01:44] to receive his mind
[1:01:48] about what the people need to change
[1:01:52] when you come to church the future will
[1:01:55] preach sometimes about what you've been
[1:01:57] thinking about
[1:01:58] him
[1:01:59] he will preach about what you've been
[1:02:01] praying about now
[1:02:03] you can preach about what you have been
[1:02:05] reading in the Bible
[1:02:09] because God knew that is what you needed
[1:02:13] and then he gives inspiration to the
[1:02:16] preacher
[1:02:17] and the preacher Taps into that
[1:02:19] anointing
[1:02:21] to be able to provide your needs
[1:02:25] that's right before you come to church
[1:02:30] that's why you need to pray
[1:02:33] we need to be in prayer
[1:02:36] for the minister for the ministry of the
[1:02:39] world
[1:02:40] but you can ask the Lord to give you
[1:02:44] so why do you pray oh Lord give me today
[1:02:47] my daily bread
[1:02:50] at that very moment the holy spirit is
[1:02:53] also giving inspiration to the priests
[1:02:58] foreign
[1:03:49] [Music]
[1:04:08] and so I'm not going to get done with
[1:04:11] this today this is just the beginning of
[1:04:12] this subjects
[1:04:16] it's a big subject that we can talk
[1:04:18] about
[1:04:20] and my desire is that after we have we
[1:04:23] have we are done with it
[1:04:27] I don't know how many times how many
[1:04:29] services we shall deal with it

[1:05:59] had risen from the dead
[1:06:03] and you remember we had a subject
[1:06:07] we spoke about the reason why he came
[1:06:11] Network
[1:06:13] do you remember why he came
[1:06:16] why did he come right here
[1:06:19] why did he come right cheers he came
[1:06:23] from Glory yeah he came down today

[1:06:31] why did Jesus
[1:06:38] yes
[1:06:41] [Music]
[1:06:46] to serve the Lord to redeem the bride
[1:06:49] but we we had the full subject on this
[1:06:52] summer please go back to it
[1:06:56] the reason why you know the Bible says
[1:06:59] so for God so loved the world
[1:07:02] and I want to speak for one hour
[1:07:09] so that I I I make sure that you get
[1:07:12] everything I'm talking about Hallelujah
[1:07:19] amen I mean
[1:07:21] so I hope it will remind me so when
[1:07:24] Jesus came yesterday the Bible says
[1:07:29] that he
[1:07:31] is only because
[1:07:40] is that right is that right that's what
[1:07:44] the Bible says
[1:08:14] all of them
[1:08:16] that is a special group of people
[1:08:19] worldwide
[1:08:21] that are not just believersible they are
[1:08:26] fully a part of Jesus
[1:08:30] you know there are many people who
[1:08:32] believe in Jesus
[1:08:34] and they go to church
[1:08:36] not all of them who believe in Jesus
[1:08:44] there are many people who love me
[1:08:47] as many people that I love
[1:08:50] my children my mother
[1:08:53] my sister
[1:08:56] but they're all not a part of me
[1:09:00] only one person is
[1:09:16] Jesus
[1:10:18] will be the only one to receive the true
[1:10:20] genuine holy
[1:10:22] ghosts
[1:10:26] because she will be a part of Jesus
[1:10:30] she will not just be a church
[1:10:34] I will not be a denomination
[1:10:37] but it will be a part of the body of our
[1:10:40] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:10:46] in my traveling I have found one who is
[1:10:50] a part of them
[1:10:54] and that one is right here
[1:10:56] have you ever found one
[1:10:59] who is a part of the body of Jesus
[1:11:06] today
[1:11:08] who has ever found one raise up your
[1:11:10] hands

[1:11:29] realize I'm a part of the body of Jesus
[1:11:35] [Music]
[1:11:36] a body of Jesus Christ
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:47] now the reason why Jesus came
[1:11:50] was to die on the cross
[1:11:56] Adam Adam and everything Adam lost him
[1:12:05] so that he can redeem the rest of Adam
[1:12:09] what was the race of Adam
[1:12:12] she was the image of God
[1:12:15] of God that was lost
[1:12:19] Jesus came to die on the cross yes
[1:12:24] and why did he die on the cross
[1:12:27] died because of his love for us
[1:12:31] that we may be redeemed back to our
[1:12:34] Originals
[1:12:45] are you following me now

[1:13:16] foreign
[1:13:57] was an image of Japan
[1:14:00] it means
[1:14:03] he was also in the image of God but
[1:14:07] that's not true remember the image of
[1:14:09] Adam
[1:14:11] that because
[1:14:14] he was already a fallen image charity
[1:14:18] family good day he was a fallen Adam
[1:14:22] were a good day who needed Redemption
[1:14:27] MMA and every body that came out of the
[1:14:32] loins of Adam in every moon
[1:14:36] was Fallen
[1:14:38] because that was the gene that they came
[1:14:41] with
[1:14:45] but there were other children
[1:14:48] who were able to come out of uh of Eve
[1:14:53] and that we seeking and also Cain had
[1:14:57] Islamic okay
[1:14:59] and they were also born
[1:15:05] in the Fallen image of Adam
[1:15:11] that was the lineage of the serpenter
[1:15:17] do we have Believers in this church this
[1:15:19] morning
[1:15:21] that was the lineage of the serpenter

[1:16:55] one from that same rest
[1:16:58] that was not falling like that like Adam
[1:17:04] but having the same genes
[1:17:07] having the same original DNA Garden
[1:17:12] hallelujah amen in order to replace

[1:19:13] we can only be able to find DNA
[1:19:17] following after the bloodline of the
[1:19:20] father
[1:19:23] hallelujah amen and so we are able to
[1:19:26] know
[1:19:30] it's not that the DNA obsessed
[1:19:37] with the same DNA with Abel says
[1:19:54] and people are confused
[1:19:57] they don't know what happened
