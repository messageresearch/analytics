[22:06] Joshua chapter five we shall read from
[22:10] verses 2. Yeshua
[22:13] foreign
[22:25] at that time the Lord said unto Joshua
[22:29] make the sharp knives and circumcise
[22:33] again the children of Israel the second
[22:35] time
[22:36] and Joshua made him sharp knives and
[22:39] circumcisation of Israel at the hill of
[22:42] our skin
[22:44] and this is the cause and this is the
[22:48] cause why Joshua did circumcise that all
[22:52] the people that came out of Egypt that
[22:54] were a man that were male even all the
[22:57] men of War died in the wilderness by the
[23:00] way after they came out of Egypt
[23:03] now all these people that were that came
[23:07] out were circumcised but all the people
[23:10] that were born in the wilderness by the
[23:13] way
[23:13] as they came forth out of Egypt they
[23:17] them they had not circumcised for the
[23:21] chair of Israel walked 40 years in the
[23:23] wilderness till all the people that were
[23:25] Men of War which came out of Egypt were
[23:28] consumed because
[23:31] they obeyed not the voice of the Lord
[23:34] and to whom the Lord swear that he would
[23:38] not show them the land which the Lord
[23:40] swear unto their father that he would
[23:43] give us a land that fought with milk
[23:47] and honey
[23:50] and verses 7 and the children whom he
[23:54] raised up in in their state then Joshua
[23:58] circumcised for they were circumcised
[24:01] because they had not circumcised them by
[24:03] the way and it came to pass when they
[24:06] had done circumcising all the people
[24:08] that they bought that they Abode in
[24:11] their place in the camp till they were a
[24:14] whole and the Lord said
[24:16] and the Lord said unto Joshua this day
[24:19] have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt

[28:45] simple advice
[28:48] that is better for us not to enter in
[28:51] heaven with one eye than to have both in

[29:23] in the name of Jesus Christ
[29:27] amen
[29:29] praise the Lord
[29:31] yeah my sharing tonight
[29:36] my text uh I'm getting the title from
[29:39] The Book of Matthew where we have read
[29:43] and I'm going to call it
[29:46] it's time to cut it off
[29:59] blessed with the name of the Lord
[30:02] amen
[30:03] yeah if you see where we have read
[30:06] whatever
[30:07] already we know what we are supposed to
[30:10] cut it off
[30:14] don't chop off your brother's head
[30:20] amen Amina but you know what you owe to
[30:23] shop it off
[30:26] there are things that we have what do we
[30:29] need to get to dinner
[30:31] which are not necessary for us to have
[30:33] them in our lives
[30:36] and unless we cut it off
[30:40] we will never see God
[30:43] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[30:47] for these things
[30:48] God has put the power in our hands
[30:54] blessed me the name of the Lord
[30:56] and where we read in Joshua
[31:00] chapter five
[31:03] from verses
[31:06] these people who are on their channel to
[31:08] the promised lands
[31:11] and all of us Bible reader we know
[31:14] that every Jew must be circumcised
[31:20] and that was the Covenant which God gave
[31:23] Abraham
[31:25] foreign
[31:40] praise be to God
[31:42] Amen and here we are seeing some bunch
[31:46] of Brothers who are not circumcised
[31:51] remember where we have read the Bible
[31:53] says this was the generation which uh
[31:56] which was born in the wilderness
[32:04] out of the two million people
[32:08] which came out of Egypt it's only to
[32:12] whom it is
[32:14] and we know the reason as to why only
[32:17] two
[32:20] blessed be the name of the Lord because
[32:23] we're here where we are from reading
[32:25] the Bible says because they did not obey
[32:29] the voice of the Lord
[32:33] they perish in the wilderness
[32:37] and all of us who are born in the
[32:39] wilderness
[32:42] they are the one who married the
[32:44] promised land
[32:46] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[32:50] whether in the wilderness
[32:52] God was washing them
[32:54] he knew that this generation was not
[32:57] circumcised
[32:58] [Music]
[33:00] amen but God never destroyed them Musa
[33:12] [Applause]
[33:20] [Applause]
[33:33] God wants to destroy
[33:42] it was a must for them to be
[33:44] circumcision
[33:47] and Israel types the church
[33:51] you must be circumcised
[33:55] amen there is another circumcision going
[33:58] on today
[34:04] when the man was circumcised
[34:07] even the woman was counted on his mind
[34:13] blessed be the name of the Lord what is
[34:16] circumcision
[34:18] is the move is the removal
[34:21] of excess skin over Surplus
[34:32] tell me the name of the Lord and for
[34:35] them each one of them was supposed to be
[34:37] circumcised
[34:40] but today when it comes to spiritual
[34:43] circumcision
[35:04] when you receive the Holy Ghost it is
[35:07] the holy spirit which will remove that
[35:11] excess flesh
[35:18] praise the Lord you are moving with many
[35:21] things which God does not want from you
[35:26] and however much you want you cannot get
[35:29] rid of them
[35:47] and this generation was not circumcised
[35:53] then time for circumcision
[36:04] and do circumcise all of them
[36:10] and all of them were circumcised
[36:15] blessed be the name of the Lord and here
[36:18] the Bible says
[36:23] you have rolled away the reproach of
[36:26] Egypt out of from them
[36:32] [Music]
[36:33] amen Nina
[36:37] and they tell it until they healed
[36:47] that's necessary to cut it off now
[36:51] amen and the message
[36:54] Covenant confirmed
[36:58] the prophet said that and and and that
[37:02] is how the church is got to come
[37:08] so much like Christ
[37:12] and look what we do what we got to do
[37:17] then they cut away and circumcise and
[37:20] Shop off
[37:25] and form and molded into the image of
[37:30] Christ
[37:35] until that church and the and the cup
[37:39] comes right smacked together
[37:51] blessed with the name of the Lord
[37:54] in this Christian channel that we are in
[37:56] again
[37:58] every time we count for a service
[38:01] every time we dedicate ourselves
[38:04] we are chopping off some things
[38:08] amen we are growing into the statue of
[38:11] the perfect man
[38:15] and that's why every Christian must
[38:18] attend Fellowship
[38:22] every time you pray
[38:25] something happens in your life
[38:29] amen and God wants all those things to
[38:33] be shoved
[38:35] because the Bible says the bride has
[38:38] made herself ready
[38:40] if God wants will come and take this bad
[38:43] habit away from God will not now yeah
[38:53] foreign
[39:25] remember this Bible is there the red
[39:28] letter is Jesus word himself yes
[39:35] he did not say
[39:37] if your eyes
[39:43] he not say that uh
[39:45] if you are right I offended
[39:49] take it to the neighbor and he blocks it
[39:52] out for me
[40:00] but he said do it yourself
[40:06] amen Amina
[40:09] it is better you enter in heaven with
[40:11] one eye
[40:13] [Music]
[40:16] than to have two eyes
[40:22] bless every name of the Lord but
[40:25] remember this Paul is not going to
[40:27] inherit the kingdom of God
[40:31] you have another body
[40:34] amen if you plug this eye out
[40:39] to enter into the kingdom
[40:44] eyes
[40:53] you are going to be blind forever
[40:56] that's not right
[40:59] blessed in the name of the Lord so God
[41:02] told them he told Joshua circumcised
[41:05] them amen everybody was supposed to be
[41:09] circumcised
[41:12] ran away from circumcision
[41:29] you can never

[41:39] circumcision has never been a simple
[41:41] thing
[41:44] amen Amina and fun enough
[41:47] even if you run away

[43:23] Christian Journey
[43:29] God has not even recognized your worship
[43:32] cartoon there no commissions
[43:35] that's why Jesus told Nicodemus
[43:39] you must be born again
[43:42] if you are to see the kingdom of God
[43:48] Amen Nina message Believers if you are
[43:52] to see the kingdom of God

[44:40] Ghost forget about Rapture video
