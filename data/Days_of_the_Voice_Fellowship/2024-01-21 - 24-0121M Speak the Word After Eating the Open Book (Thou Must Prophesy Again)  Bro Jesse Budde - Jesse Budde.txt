the east in the parts of Toro Ginger we also had some from the the s others came from carja is really far away I know that because I've been there several times so the Brethren were able to come and

Wednesday he was ministering at speckled and then on uh on Friday he was ministering at lifeboard Life Ministries and this weekend theyve traveled to Ginger be with Pastor Ste and we we're happy to share the ministry God has given to us with others that because the gift when God gives a man a gift it's not really for his local assembly only the gift is for the entire body of Christ that's why as pastors we keep sharing Ministries and today we are going to share another [Music] gift Jess from bud that's another gift of God and so when God gives a man a gift is not for his local assembly only for his place where he comes from for the entire body of Jesus and so our pastor is blessing Ginger today and also the meetings we are streamed actually all over the world yeah all over the world uh

time the tax collectors came to Jesus and to his disciples we want tax you preaching the gospel here all over here withay tax Jesus never run away he never told his you know have to go and work they will already work I've seen this talk about nonbelievers that prayer shouldn't be on the work yes you should work but you should also pray I have testimonies of people have been blessed through being prayer War so some people think prayer is not serving it is the greatest work for God this world is protected by prayers of s we have the peace we have because of prayers of calamities earthquakes fine they are prevented by of pestilences incable diseases they are prevented by prayers of s thees of God is upon this Earth because we are here as s of God we are praying but you wait when you go the they are going to face pestil they're going to face calamities they going to face earthquakes they're going to face trouble because when we live the Holy Spirit we live and go to is and judgment

the name of the Lord that was not an ID word the man of God has ministered to us he says the holy spirit is the enforcer of the word I wanted to to take a moment and imagine these two examples I'm going to give you Second Kings 527 the man of God Els a man that had done something wrong who was a servant of the Lord but he lied and he hid some things in his house and he spoke in vain in the name of the Lord and he lied to the prophet so when elah came to him he looked at him and he spoke these words the LI of shall G unto thee and unto thy seed forever and he went out from his presence now he's talking about G he went out of the presence of that moment a as white as snow this was greater than witchcraft the words of elah how how did it happen the man of God said it and the Holy Spirit came upon those and he enforced it and in that moment that second The Man became a how did that happen what science the power of the Holy did the man did the man believe it how can you believe such a Negative prophecy [Music] maybe didn't believe it but the power of the Holy Ghost comes on the word spoken by the and he enforces it you may not have believed everything the man say the man of God and because it has been spoken not return unto God voice everything that has been said the Holy Spirit has already enforced and it has already happened it's not going to happen has already happened right here now hallelujah amen if you were poor you are no longer poor you are no longer poor I'm telling you why because the man of God came here he prophesied money to you if you don't like it that's up
