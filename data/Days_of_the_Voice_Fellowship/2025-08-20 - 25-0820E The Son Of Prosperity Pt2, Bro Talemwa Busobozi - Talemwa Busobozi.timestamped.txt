[41:14] streaming on zoom there.
[41:17] So uh it's not only here tonight.
[41:22] So we send our regards and greetings to
[41:24] the saints on Zoom.
[41:28] The precious name of our Lord Jesus.
[41:31] So this is going to be part two
[41:35] of what we shared at the church here on
[41:37] on Sunday,
[41:41] son of prosperity.
[41:45] Uh we take um Genesis 39.
[41:51] We begin from verses one.
[41:55] And Joseph was brought down to Egypt.
[41:58] Because of time I will not interpret the
[42:00] reading but you can just read in your
[42:01] Bible if you are reading the Luganda
[42:02] Bible. And Joseph was brought down to
[42:05] Egypt and Portifer an officer of Pharaoh
[42:09] captain of the God an Egyptian bought
[42:12] him
[42:14] of the hands of the Ishalites which had
[42:18] brought him down thther. And the Lord
[42:21] was with Joseph and he was a prosperous
[42:24] man. And he was in the house of his
[42:26] master, the Egyptian. And his master saw
[42:29] that the Lord was with him, and that the
[42:32] Lord made all that he did to prosper in
[42:35] his hand. And Joseph found grace in his
[42:38] sight, and he served him, and he made
[42:42] him overseer over his house, and all
[42:44] that he had he put into his hand. And it
[42:47] came to pass from the time that he had
[42:49] made him overseer in his house and over
[42:52] all that he had that the Lord blessed
[42:55] the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake.
[42:59] And the blessing of the Lord was upon
[43:01] all that he had in the house and in the
[43:05] field. And I just love that verse. All
[43:07] that he had. The Lord blessed all that
[43:10] he had in in the house and in the field.
[43:15] Amen. And he left all that
[43:18] all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he
[43:21] knew not all he had, save the bread
[43:24] which he did eat. And Joseph was a
[43:27] goodly person and wellfavored. And it
[43:30] came to pass after these things that his
[43:32] master's wife um uh cast her eyes upon
[43:36] Joseph, and she said, "Lie with me." me.
[43:38] But he refused and said unto his
[43:40] master's wife, "Behold, my master
[43:42] walteth not what he is with me in the
[43:45] house." And he has commanded all that he
[43:48] has to my hand. There is none greater in
[43:51] this house than I, neither has he kept
[43:53] back anything from me but thee, because
[43:56] thou art his wife. How then can I do
[43:58] this great wickedness and sin against
[44:00] God?" And it came to pass as she spake
[44:03] to Joseph day by day that he hearkened
[44:05] not unto her to lie by her or to be with
[44:09] her. And it came to pass about this time
[44:11] that Joseph went into the house to do
[44:14] business. And there was none of the men
[44:16] of the house there within.
[44:19] Praise the name of the Lord.
[44:21] &gt;&gt; And and and she caught and she caught
[44:23] him by his garment, saying, "Lie with
[44:26] me." and he left his garment in our hand
[44:29] and fled and got out. Amen. And that's
[44:32] why we as believers whenever wherever we
[44:34] are, we don't we try to keep the order.
[44:38] You know, you don't want to be found in
[44:40] a house alone with you know somebody
[44:43] that is not your sister, your mother and
[44:46] and and then you say, "Well, for me, I'm
[44:48] okay with it." And you find that in the
[44:49] world they even host them in their
[44:51] houses. You find I a young man hosting a
[44:54] sister in the house. We do not believe
[44:55] in that kind of thing. You see, uh, it
[44:57] spoils the testimony and and Joseph just
[45:00] went in the house to see what he would,
[45:02] you know, to try and do some work there.
[45:04] And there was nobody else. And that's
[45:06] the opportunity that this woman got to
[45:08] be able to try and defile his testimony.
[45:11] But we thank God that if you are a true
[45:13] child of God and you are sincere in your
[45:15] heart, no one can defile your testimony.
[45:19] And I will continue here. And it came to
[45:21] pass when he when she saw that he had
[45:23] left his garment in her hand, and was
[45:25] fled forth, that she called unto the men
[45:28] of her house, and spake unto them,
[45:30] saying, See, he has brought him in
[45:33] Hebrew unto he unto us to mock us. He
[45:36] came in unto me to lie with me, and I
[45:40] cried with a loud voice. And it came to
[45:42] pass when he had when he heard that I I
[45:45] lifted up my voice and cried and that he
[45:47] left his garment with me and fled and
[45:49] got him out. And she laid up his garment
[45:53] by her until his lord came home. And she
[45:56] came and she spake unto him according to
[45:59] these words, saying, The Hebrew servant
[46:02] which thou hast brought unto us came in
[46:04] unto me to mock me. And it came to pass
[46:07] as I lifted up my voice and cried that
[46:10] he left his garment with me and fled
[46:13] out. And it came to pass when his master
[46:15] heard the words of his wife which she
[46:18] spake unto him, saying, "After this
[46:21] manner did thy servant to me, that his
[46:24] wrath was kind old." And Joseph's master
[46:28] took him and put him into the prison, a
[46:30] place where the king's prisoners were
[46:33] bound. And he was there in the prison.
[46:36] And the Lord was with Joseph. And the
[46:38] Lord was with Joseph. Everybody,
[46:40] everybody say that. And the Lord was
[46:42] with Joseph.
[46:43] &gt;&gt; And the Lord was with Joseph.
[46:44] &gt;&gt; All right. Now listen to this. And
[46:46] showed him mercy and gave him favor in
[46:48] the sight of the keeper of the prison.
[46:50] And the keeper of the prison committed
[46:52] to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that
[46:55] were in the prison. And whatsoever they
[46:58] did there, he was the doer of it. And
[47:01] the the keeper of the prison looked not
[47:03] to anything that was under his hand
[47:06] because the Lord was with him and that
[47:09] and that which he did the Lord made it
[47:11] to prosper. Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[47:14] May be seated tonight.
[47:17] Now I want you to see
[47:19] that um when he arrived in in the hand
[47:22] in the house of uh of Potifer,
[47:28] &gt;&gt; there is nothing that was under or in
[47:31] his hand that Pifer touched
[47:37] that it looked like it seemed as though
[47:39] actually it was that whatever he touched
[47:42] was his.
[47:46] that no one else touched.
[47:48] And in this case we find that he was
[47:50] given to take care of the entire
[47:52] household of Portifer.
[47:57] And so Portifer it came to a place
[47:59] whereby even Portifer did not know what
[48:01] he had.
[48:06] And when he when he went to prison,
[48:09] even in prison,
[48:11] no one uh the prison guard, the one who
[48:14] was supposed to be responsible for those
[48:16] duties,
[48:18] he handed over to Joseph.
[48:21] He said, "Now, since you are here,
[48:23] Joseph,
[48:24] I I resigned my duties.
[48:28] Take over." Joseph was never a prisoner.
[48:33] He was sent to prison for a purpose.
[48:36] And that's how our seed of God is.
[48:39] The seed of God will always prosper.
[48:43] No matter which place, no matter what
[48:46] situation, no matter what condition, no
[48:49] matter what problem, if you a seed, no
[48:53] matter where you go, you have to
[48:56] prosper.
[48:58] Praise the name of the Lord. Why?
[49:01] Because you have received the son of
[49:04] prosecutority.
[49:09] Amen. He that has the son also has the
[49:12] father.
[49:16] Jesus is the son of prosperity.
[49:20] And Jesus today is not here physically
[49:24] but he's here in the form of his word.
[49:27] When a child of God receives the word.
[49:30] Amen. He has to live in prosperity.
[49:34] He has to walk in prosperity.
[49:36] He has to bask in prosperity.
[49:40] Every place, everything he touches,
[49:43] we must prosper.
[49:45] But the problem that we have, we do not
[49:48] receive the son of prosperity.
[49:51] And that's the problem. That is the
[49:54] problem. That is the main issue.
[49:58] The Bible says, "Seek ye the kingdom of
[50:01] God and all his righteousness
[50:05] and all the rest."
[50:08] What are the rest? Not some of the rest,
[50:12] but everything else.
[50:15] Name it. What do you have need of?
[50:19] Just think about it. Can you now begin
[50:22] to name it? Whatever you have need of,
[50:26] you might be needing a scholarship.
[50:29] You might be needing a job. You might be
[50:32] needing a wife. You might be needing a a
[50:35] a husband. You might be needing a child.
[50:40] Am I preaching to someone here tonight?
[50:42] Whatever you have need of, you might be
[50:45] needing a piece of land. You might be
[50:48] needing a house of your own or maybe a
[50:51] car. You know, am I mentioning things
[50:53] that some of you need?
[50:56] Where if I mention something you need,
[50:58] you better say, "Amen."
[51:01] You might be needing, you know, a
[51:02] bicycle
[51:04] or maybe you need a motorcycle
[51:07] or maybe you need, you know, an air
[51:09] ticket to go somewhere or maybe you need
[51:12] a visa. Now all those things
[51:16] he said in his word shall be addicted
[51:21] one after the other.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. So when we
[51:25] talk about prosperity
[51:28] now listen to me carefully church. I
[51:31] have only one hour because of the
[51:32] limitation of Zoom.
[51:35] But if I don't get done I'll continue on
[51:37] Sunday. But
[51:39] for now I want you to just stay with me
[51:41] tonight.
[51:42] Praise the Lord. The brethren who attend
[51:45] midweek service
[51:48] are usually the ones on fire for God.
[51:51] So I want to hear more. Amen.
[51:54] I want to hear more. I receive it.
[51:57] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[52:00] We we want to have a hot church,
[52:04] not a cold one, not a lukewarm one.
[52:08] Amen. And so you talk about all these
[52:12] other things
[52:14] according to the promise of the word
[52:18] he promised he will add them. Tell your
[52:21] neighbor he will add them. He will add
[52:24] them. He will add them. Are you telling
[52:27] your neighbor he will add them?
[52:30] Turn around and tell your neighbor he
[52:31] will add them.
[52:34] He will add them.
[52:36] We should be believers.
[52:39] Amen.
[52:40] &gt;&gt; We should be believers
[52:42] and that is why we should not believe
[52:45] for small things.
[52:47] We should believe for big things
[52:50] you know things of substance
[52:53] and see and other things otherwise.
[52:57] It might even be healing.
[53:00] Whatever it is that you have in life, he
[53:02] promise he will add.
[53:04] Maybe you want your business to boom.
[53:08] He will do it.
[53:10] You have to have faith.
[53:13] Maybe you want to succeed in your exams.
[53:17] He promise he will do it.
[53:19] Do you know? Do you know? We have very
[53:22] many testimonies of people who did not
[53:26] even read properly but you know they
[53:27] trusted God so much
[53:32] and when they went in the paper you know
[53:35] before they could go in the paper. They
[53:37] would dream the whole paper
[53:40] and then go to the paper and pass it
[53:43] find everything they saw in the night
[53:47] was what? So God helped them cheat.
[53:52] I'm not saying you should be lazy to
[53:53] study and think that God will help you
[53:54] cheat.
[53:58] But I believe if you are a son of God
[54:02] who has received the word in your heart
[54:05] and you are a genuine believer,
[54:08] you cannot fail exam.
[54:14] Hallelujah. You should pass
[54:16] and be one of the best.
[54:19] You should not be a tail.
[54:22] You should be ahead
[54:24] in everything you do. You must seek to
[54:27] excel.
[54:30] But the problem that we have many chase
[54:33] after this thing,
[54:36] many chase after money, many ch after
[54:39] visa, many chess after a building, many
[54:42] chess after this and that and wife,
[54:44] husband and you know friend and you know
[54:48] building and car and which God promised
[54:51] he will
[54:53] but he promised he will add.
[54:57] He never said he will give.
[55:00] He said he will add.
[55:03] Are you following me? Add to what?
[55:07] If you seek the right thing,
[55:11] if you seek the kingdom of God
[55:14] and his righteousness
[55:17] and all these things
[55:19] he will add.
[55:21] The word is prosperity.
[55:24] Prosperity.
[55:25] Amen. Is you cannot claim to have it.
[55:29] only if you have the son of prosperity.
[55:36] We found on Sunday that prosperity means
[55:39] where is is from the Hebrew which means
[55:41] shalak
[55:45] which means to rush
[55:47] to advance
[55:49] to push forward
[55:51] to make progress
[55:54] to succeed
[55:56] be profitable.
[55:59] So the problem is many people want to go
[56:02] forward.
[56:04] Many want people they want to pro
[56:05] progress
[56:07] succeed in their academics, succeed in
[56:11] the in in their this and their job,
[56:14] succeed in their marriage, succeed but
[56:18] they do not have the ingredient to
[56:22] succeed.
[56:28] That is why it is so sad that in our
[56:32] generation in our age that is called
[56:37] the people of this age
[56:40] actually think that they are prosperous
[56:46] according to them
[56:48] they think they're prosperous
[56:51] but according to God he doesn't think
[56:54] so.
[56:55] So in other words, someone can acquire
[56:58] all the wealth of the world
[57:02] but not be prosperous.
[57:06] Someone may have nothing of this world
[57:10] but actually be prosperous.
[57:14] All right. Now let let us proceed here.
[57:17] If you follow me, I'm sure you'll be
[57:19] blessed.
[57:21] If you look at Revelation 3,
[57:24] we read it on Sunday
[57:26] which he says this is the message the
[57:28] angel of the church of the Ladyians.
[57:31] [Music]
[57:32] He says these things say the amen
[57:34] faithful and a true witness.
[57:38] Amen. The beginning of the creation of
[57:40] God.
[57:43] The amen. The so be it. Amen. And and he
[57:48] and he says I know thy works.
[57:51] I know you are neither cold nor hot.
[57:55] I would thou art what cold or hot.
[57:59] So then because thou at lukewarm
[58:03] and neither cold nor hot,
[58:06] I will spew thee out of my mouth.
[58:10] Because thou sayest, I am rich.
[58:13] I am increased with goods and have need
[58:15] of nothing.
[58:17] And you know not that you are rich,
[58:20] miserable, poor, blind, naked. I want
[58:25] you to imagine
[58:27] this is the worst case scenario
[58:30] [Music]
[58:32] of someone who is actually in this
[58:34] situation,
[58:36] but they don't know they in this
[58:37] situation.
[58:39] I hope you are not one of them.
[58:42] Imagine being wretched,
[58:44] being miserable,
[58:46] being poor,
[58:47] poor, blind, naked, but you don't know.
[58:54] So you don't behave as if you are.
[58:58] So the people we are talking about here
[59:01] are not the people who are necessarily
[59:03] aware of their condition.
[59:06] Is the spirit of the age.
[59:09] They think they are rich. They think
[59:11] they increased with good
[59:13] and and but yet they have nothing.
[59:17] But they think they have need of
[59:18] nothing.
[59:21] And I wanted to quote for you out of the
[59:23] Leadian church 8.
[59:26] And I want you to follow closely. He
[59:28] says, "Now anybody knows that it is um
[59:30] lukewarm water that makes you sick at
[59:32] the stomach.
[59:36] Lukewarm water is about the best thing
[59:38] to drink. If you want to vote,
[59:43] church has made sick, God sick, and he
[59:45] has declared he will spew it out.
[59:51] Oh, it reminds us how God felt before
[59:53] the flood.
[59:57] Oh, would to God the church were cold or
[59:59] hot.
[1:00:03] You know, before the flood, the church
[1:00:06] thought they were prosperous.
[1:00:09] The world thought that we has prospered.
[1:00:12] Do you know in the days of Noah
[1:00:15] that the earth had prospered naturally
[1:00:19] speaking even more than our generation.
[1:00:24] [Music]
[1:00:26] You see, you think that we are developed
[1:00:29] but the development of the days of Noah
[1:00:34] is actually much more than ours today.
[1:00:38] We have not reached
[1:00:40] where they had reached.
[1:00:43] You remember in the days of Noah before
[1:00:46] the flood there were buildings like the
[1:00:50] great pyramid of Giza
[1:00:52] which until today
[1:00:55] but no one has been able to replicate.
[1:00:59] Not even the great USA,
[1:01:03] you know, they have not been able to
[1:01:04] redo it,
[1:01:06] you know. And the prophet says, "Nobody
[1:01:08] knows who built it."
[1:01:11] And then he says, "Well, I know it's is
[1:01:13] um and then he says it is Enoch that
[1:01:15] built it."
[1:01:17] Why? Because he was a prophet.
[1:01:19] Everything was perfect and accurate,
[1:01:23] you know, and and you know, he goes to
[1:01:24] in the geometry and he begins to talk
[1:01:26] about it and try and show
[1:01:31] how it was God's second Bible.
[1:01:35] Those of you who have been reading the
[1:01:36] message, you know we have three Bibles.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; God has had three Bibles.
[1:01:42] The first Bible
[1:01:44] is is the stars.
[1:01:46] The the the the the moon and the sun and
[1:01:50] you know talk about astronomy
[1:01:54] and you know then the second is the this
[1:01:57] great pyramid.
[1:02:01] And the third one is right here. And
[1:02:05] then he quotes and he says, "You
[1:02:06] remember the three wise men?
[1:02:09] They were reading the first Bible
[1:02:12] and the first Bible led them to Christ."
[1:02:16] Praise the name of the Lord. And and you
[1:02:18] see uh the second Bible was also
[1:02:23] pointing none to none nothing else but
[1:02:25] Christ.
[1:02:27] It was built like all the other
[1:02:29] pyramids,
[1:02:31] but it's the only pyramid
[1:02:34] that did not actually have the capstone.
[1:02:39] And you know when you come to the third
[1:02:40] Bible,
[1:02:42] it also talks about the same thing.
[1:02:46] How the how Jesus was rejected,
[1:02:49] how Christ was rejected. And you know it
[1:02:52] says the stone which was rejected it
[1:02:54] became the chief cornerstone.
[1:02:57] So we see that those three Bibles are
[1:03:00] interrelated interconnected.
[1:03:03] Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah.
[1:03:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; And so well we'll continue right here.
[1:03:10] So then he says
[1:03:14] best of all she would be fant. She is
[1:03:17] not. Sentence has been passed.
[1:03:23] And maybe what I wanted to say right
[1:03:25] there is that uh in the days of the
[1:03:26] flood
[1:03:29] these people had the world it had
[1:03:32] arrived at a great civilization.
[1:03:38] But after the flood
[1:03:40] we noticed that you know where
[1:03:42] everything went down and then they
[1:03:44] started building again.
[1:03:48] They thought they were progressing
[1:03:50] before the flood.
[1:03:53] Listen, you cannot progress
[1:03:57] if you reject
[1:04:00] the word of the hour.
[1:04:04] You can only progress
[1:04:07] if you are walking in the word of the
[1:04:09] hour.
[1:04:13] They rejected the word of the hour.
[1:04:15] The word of the hour can only come
[1:04:17] through a prophet.
[1:04:21] According to Amos 3:7,
[1:04:24] the Bible says God will do nothing
[1:04:27] but he will reveal his secrets
[1:04:30] to his servants the prophet. So in every
[1:04:33] generation before anything major
[1:04:35] happens,
[1:04:37] God will send a prophet and this prophet
[1:04:40] will have thus sayeth the Lord.
[1:04:44] Whatever he says is not up for debate.
[1:04:48] God has a very a big sense of humor.
[1:04:53] He will always bypass the paved way, the
[1:04:56] beaten path.
[1:05:00] &gt;&gt; He lives it. He bypasses
[1:05:03] and then he comes to a way
[1:05:06] or through a way that no one knew.
[1:05:11] Imagine in the days of Noah there were
[1:05:14] the big religions
[1:05:16] like we have today. But God bypassed all
[1:05:20] and used a man called Noah. The Bible
[1:05:24] says Noah
[1:05:26] found grace
[1:05:29] in the sight of God.
[1:05:32] There is something about Noah
[1:05:35] in connection with Joseph
[1:05:38] that both Noah and Joseph
[1:05:41] found grace
[1:05:43] in the sight of God.
[1:05:46] There is something in connection to
[1:05:48] other people.
[1:05:50] Abraham found grace.
[1:05:53] Mary found grace. And all these people
[1:05:58] that actually found grace
[1:06:00] They had received something
[1:06:04] that nobody else had received.
[1:06:07] They had received a message.
[1:06:10] Amen. From God. And I tell you something
[1:06:14] that we have found grace.
[1:06:19] We bride in this last day.
[1:06:24] Amen. We are not like other birds.
[1:06:28] We are a different kind of bird.
[1:06:32] Oh, we are not vultures.
[1:06:35] We are not any kind of bird.
[1:06:38] A vulture that eats good and bad.
[1:06:42] We are a kind of bird that feeds on
[1:06:45] specific food.
[1:06:50] We cannot eat rotten food.
[1:06:52] We eat fresh kill.
[1:06:55] That's why we are eagles.
[1:07:00] &gt;&gt; An eagle will only eat a fresh kill.
[1:07:04] Amen. The Bible says wherever the
[1:07:07] carcass is,
[1:07:09] there the eagle's gone.
[1:07:12] Fresh killed.
[1:07:14] They will gather around it. What are
[1:07:17] they needing? They want to be fed. They
[1:07:21] are favored.
[1:07:22] I say like Mary, Mary received a word
[1:07:25] from the angel of the Lord.
[1:07:28] Nobody else understood what was going
[1:07:30] on.
[1:07:32] But Mary was favored. Do you know you
[1:07:34] are favored?
[1:07:36] Do you know you are not a denomination?
[1:07:39] And because you are not part of any
[1:07:41] denomination,
[1:07:43] you are highly favored.
[1:07:46] You are favored.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; Oh, can you say I am favored?
[1:07:52] Amen. If you are favored,
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; hear this now. If you are favored, it
[1:07:58] means you must be prosperous every step
[1:08:00] of the way.
[1:08:04] Hallelujah. Amen. It means you must
[1:08:06] progress.
[1:08:08] Whatever you do, you must progress. You
[1:08:12] must go forward. You cannot go back from
[1:08:16] glory to glory to glory
[1:08:20] because you are blessed.
[1:08:23] If you're favored, it means you are
[1:08:25] blessed.
[1:08:27] The angel told Mary
[1:08:32] and I say we too are highly favored.
[1:08:35] We are highly favored.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Praise the name of the Lord. We have
[1:08:41] received something that this world knows
[1:08:43] nothing about. the
[1:08:46] the self
[1:08:49] that we can see
[1:08:52] you know is is our garment. Let's follow
[1:08:55] let's follow this.
[1:08:58] He says oh
[1:09:00] talks about a lukewarm church.
[1:09:03] Oh God still has a voice for the people
[1:09:04] of the world even as he has given a
[1:09:07] voice to the bride.
[1:09:10] That voice is in the bride.
[1:09:14] as we have said and we will talk about
[1:09:17] that later.
[1:09:18] Look at the first phrase of this verse.
[1:09:23] Because thou sayest,
[1:09:25] see they were speaking.
[1:09:28] I'm He talking about the other birds
[1:09:29] now.
[1:09:31] He's talking about the other
[1:09:32] denominations.
[1:09:34] He's talking about you know the rest of
[1:09:35] the world.
[1:09:36] They were talking
[1:09:39] saying that they are rich.
[1:09:42] So God so they were talking as the
[1:09:45] mouthpiece of God.
[1:09:49] This proves exactly what I said. He says
[1:09:51] but though they say it
[1:09:55] does not make it right.
[1:10:00] The Catholic church says that she speaks
[1:10:01] for God.
[1:10:04] Saying she is the assured voice of the
[1:10:05] Lord.
[1:10:08] How many people can be so spiritually
[1:10:09] wicked is more than I know.
[1:10:14] But they produce according to the seed
[1:10:17] which is in them.
[1:10:20] And we know where the seed their seed
[1:10:22] came from.
[1:10:24] And we know where our seed come from.
[1:10:28] The spoken word
[1:10:31] is the original seed.
[1:10:34] We have received an original seed,
[1:10:38] not a hybrid.
[1:10:41] The original
[1:10:43] what preached.
[1:10:46] We speak what the Bible say.
[1:10:49] That makes us the original.
[1:10:55] Follow me closely.
[1:10:58] That that was her self-esteem.
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; The Laian church is saying I am rich
[1:11:07] and increase with goods and have need of
[1:11:08] nothing.
[1:11:10] She looked at herself
[1:11:13] and that is what she saw.
[1:11:15] She said I am rich. Which means that she
[1:11:19] is wealthy in the things of this world.
[1:11:22] [Music]
[1:11:24] She is boasting in the face of James
[1:11:26] 2:5.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; What does James 2:5 say? It says,
[1:11:32] "Harken, my beloved,
[1:11:35] brethren, has not God chosen the poor of
[1:11:38] this world, rich in
[1:11:43] hes of the kingdom,
[1:11:46] which he has promised to them that love
[1:11:48] him.
[1:11:50] But ye have despised the poor.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why they preach the kind of
[1:11:56] the way they preach. They say, "Well, if
[1:11:58] you don't have money, you you are cast."
[1:12:03] To them, money is equals to God.
[1:12:08] Money is equals to the blessing.
[1:12:12] But in this case, we see that's not so.
[1:12:16] They have all
[1:12:19] but they are poor
[1:12:22] and they do not know.
[1:12:25] Do not I would rather be called poor
[1:12:28] when I am rich than calling myself rich
[1:12:33] when I am poor and I don't know.
[1:12:36] Do not rich men oppress you and draw you
[1:12:39] before the judgment seats.
[1:12:42] Do not they blasphem that worthy name by
[1:12:45] which ye are called?
[1:12:48] Now I do not suggest that a rich person
[1:12:51] cannot be spiritual.
[1:12:55] But we all know that the word says very
[1:12:57] few are.
[1:13:00] It is the poor that predominate uh in
[1:13:03] the body of the true church.
[1:13:08] Most of the believers in the world are
[1:13:10] actually poor.
[1:13:13] Not only in our generation but even the
[1:13:16] generations before us.
[1:13:19] You see now then if the church becomes
[1:13:22] full of wealth
[1:13:24] we know only one thing
[1:13:28] which means the glory is departed.
[1:13:31] It has been written over her portals.
[1:13:35] We can't deny that
[1:13:38] for that is the word. And we see it even
[1:13:41] in countries, nations
[1:13:43] where when before they became wealthy,
[1:13:46] they received God and God was moving in
[1:13:49] their country and they took the gospel
[1:13:50] all over the world.
[1:13:55] But when now they received the wealth of
[1:13:58] the world, they kicked Jesus Christ out.
[1:14:02] They received the God of the world.
[1:14:05] You've seen it even when they have their
[1:14:07] games.
[1:14:08] They're bringing back the idolatry which
[1:14:10] was there in the 1600s.
[1:14:15] And now here in Africa,
[1:14:17] many of us are poor.
[1:14:20] And you will find because of that, you
[1:14:23] have a lot of believers in our churches.
[1:14:26] And even when these go to Europe and
[1:14:28] other countries
[1:14:31] and they make a little bit of money,
[1:14:34] they walk away, they go back again to
[1:14:36] the world. And I hope you don't serve
[1:14:39] God because you are poor.
[1:14:43] Don't come here because you want God to
[1:14:45] give you some money.
[1:14:48] Church is not a place to make money.
[1:14:52] No. Church is a place to find God.
[1:14:57] Church is a place to find something the
[1:14:59] world cannot gain.
[1:15:03] If you want to make money, you go make
[1:15:05] money
[1:15:07] in the business place. You know he
[1:15:10] promised. Amen. If you have received the
[1:15:13] word,
[1:15:15] there is a promise.
[1:15:17] You will be prosperous.
[1:15:20] You will succeed
[1:15:22] in everything you do. You might have a
[1:15:25] little business when you go out there.
[1:15:28] God will make you to succeed.
[1:15:31] When you are in school, God will make
[1:15:33] you to succeed. You know what? That's
[1:15:36] true prosperity.
[1:15:41] Talk about wealth in the church.
[1:15:44] Why they never there has never been such
[1:15:46] a show of wealth
[1:15:50] like today. The beautiful sanctuaries
[1:15:54] They are multiplied in number
[1:15:57] as never before. The various groups v
[1:16:01] with each other
[1:16:04] to see who can build the biggest and
[1:16:06] loveliest
[1:16:09] and they build education centers
[1:16:12] worth unimated millions
[1:16:15] and those buildings are used only an
[1:16:17] hour or two a week.
[1:16:22] Now that would not be uh such a terrible
[1:16:25] thing
[1:16:26] but they expect
[1:16:29] this little time spent by the children
[1:16:30] in the education plant to take the place
[1:16:33] of the hours of training supposed to be
[1:16:34] given in the home.
[1:16:42] That's why parents must train their
[1:16:44] children.
[1:16:47] We must not expect that it the the
[1:16:50] schools can train our children.
[1:16:54] Schools can never take a place of a
[1:16:55] mother or a father.
[1:16:59] Do we believe that
[1:17:01] money has powered into the church
[1:17:04] until different denominations own stocks
[1:17:07] and bonds and factories, oils and and
[1:17:09] insurance companies.
[1:17:17] They have powered money into welfare.
[1:17:23] and retirement funds.
[1:17:26] Now, this sounds good, but it has become
[1:17:30] a snare to the ministers.
[1:17:33] For if they decide to leave their group
[1:17:35] for more light or the love of God,
[1:17:41] their tensions are lost to them.
[1:17:45] Most can't even say and can't can't even
[1:17:48] stand and and stay with their pressure
[1:17:50] groups.
[1:17:53] They can't stand this and stay with
[1:17:55] their pressure groups.
[1:17:58] Now listen, I would love to talk about
[1:18:00] all that but I have limited time. So
[1:18:02] let's continue. Now don't forget that
[1:18:04] this is the last age.
[1:18:06] We know that this is the last age
[1:18:10] because Israel has gone back to
[1:18:11] Palestine.
[1:18:13] If we believe that he is really coming,
[1:18:18] then there must be something wrong
[1:18:21] with those who are building so vastly.
[1:18:27] It makes one thing that these people
[1:18:29] plan on staying here forever.
[1:18:33] Oh, that the coming of Jesus is hundreds
[1:18:35] of years old.
[1:18:39] You see the what this the quote that I'm
[1:18:41] reading right here.
[1:18:44] is one of the reasons why in our in our
[1:18:46] rooms many believers did not even go
[1:18:48] ahead to build churches or big churches
[1:18:54] because they they like okay for us we
[1:18:55] believe it's coming quickly
[1:18:58] but the ones who are building don't
[1:18:59] believe
[1:19:00] [Music]
[1:19:02] but you need to understand the spirit
[1:19:03] within which brother was saying these
[1:19:05] things
[1:19:07] you know he's talking about the
[1:19:09] denominations
[1:19:11] who do not have the son of prosperity.
[1:19:15] He's not talking about believers
[1:19:18] who have received the word.
[1:19:23] Do do you know that religion today is
[1:19:25] known as a big business?
[1:19:30] It is an absolute fact
[1:19:32] that they are placing business managers
[1:19:34] in the churches
[1:19:38] to take care of finances.
[1:19:40] Is this what God desires?
[1:19:43] Did not his word teach us in the book of
[1:19:45] Acts that seven men full of the Holy
[1:19:47] Ghost
[1:19:51] and faith serve the Lord in the in
[1:19:53] business matters.
[1:19:57] You can surely see why God said you are
[1:19:58] you you say you are wealthy. I never
[1:20:01] said so.
[1:20:05] You see, there are radio programs,
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; television programs,
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; numerous church endeavors
[1:20:13] that are costing millions and millions
[1:20:16] of dollars.
[1:20:18] Uhhuh. Now, right here again, they said,
[1:20:21] you see, we don't believe in having TV.
[1:20:25] We don't believe in having radio program
[1:20:28] because it will cost a lot of money.
[1:20:32] Brother talked about it.
[1:20:34] You need to understand the spirit within
[1:20:37] which he say these things.
[1:20:40] You need to to read between the lines.
[1:20:45] Praise the name of the Lord. Who is he
[1:20:47] speaking about
[1:20:50] the big denomination?
[1:20:52] The ones who have
[1:20:57] rejected the word.
[1:20:59] The moment any church rejects the word,
[1:21:03] they become
[1:21:06] because they have rejected God.
[1:21:09] They have rejected a son of prosperity.
[1:21:12] They can never prosper.
[1:21:15] regardless of how much money they have,
[1:21:19] regardless of how much wealth they have.
[1:21:22] Look, prosperity
[1:21:24] means succeeding,
[1:21:27] means going forward.
[1:21:29] So, where are they going? They are going
[1:21:32] nowhere because they can't go to the
[1:21:35] rapture.
[1:21:36] The body of the bride,
[1:21:40] the body of Christ,
[1:21:42] the word body
[1:21:45] is going forward
[1:21:48] because we are going in a rapture
[1:21:51] soon and very soon. We are going to see
[1:21:53] the king. Listen, it's not about our
[1:21:56] church.
[1:21:58] That's why we are not preaching our
[1:22:00] church.
[1:22:01] We are not preaching our prophet. We are
[1:22:04] not preaching our bastards. Our message
[1:22:08] is about Christ.
[1:22:11] We are talking about him. The one who
[1:22:14] died for us. Listen Christ is the word.
[1:22:18] Don't be deceived.
[1:22:20] Christ is the word. But when they reject
[1:22:23] the word,
[1:22:25] they have rejected the Christ.
[1:22:27] And he said, "Be aware lest any man
[1:22:31] spoil you
[1:22:33] through philosophy,
[1:22:34] through vain deceit,
[1:22:37] after the traditions of men,
[1:22:40] the rudiments of the world,
[1:22:44] but not after Christ."
[1:22:48] So you see friends, this is about
[1:22:50] Christ.
[1:22:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you are preaching Christ,
[1:22:55] preach it on the television. preach on
[1:22:57] the radio. Amen. It's okay to have a big
[1:23:00] program to do that
[1:23:03] as long as you are not fathering your
[1:23:06] church.
[1:23:08] [Music]
[1:23:10] We are furthering the the gospel.
[1:23:14] We are fathering Christ.
[1:23:17] Amen. So wealth powers and powers into
[1:23:20] the church.
[1:23:23] The membership increases
[1:23:25] along with the money.
[1:23:28] Yet this is the sad story. Yet the work
[1:23:32] is not being done.
[1:23:37] That's why I say they're not prospering.
[1:23:43] The work is not being done as it was
[1:23:46] done when there was no money.
[1:23:52] But men rested solely on the ability
[1:23:56] given them by the Holy Ghost.
[1:24:01] I fear that even us as believers of this
[1:24:05] message have not come to a place where
[1:24:09] we have made so much money
[1:24:13] that we have forgotten why we should
[1:24:15] make money.
[1:24:18] He's trying to show Listen, don't miss
[1:24:20] this.
[1:24:22] He's trying to show you that in the the
[1:24:24] church of the last days
[1:24:28] made so much money
[1:24:32] the membership of the church has
[1:24:33] increased.
[1:24:35] They boast of hundreds,
[1:24:39] thousands, tens of thousands,
[1:24:42] you know. They bust of having big
[1:24:44] membership.
[1:24:47] Talk about having mega churches.
[1:24:50] Of course, the money has also increased
[1:24:54] in offerings and in
[1:24:57] what has the church accomplished.
[1:25:03] He says it has accomplished so little.
[1:25:07] It has done so little
[1:25:10] compared to what they did when they had
[1:25:12] so little money.
[1:25:16] What happened? They think they're rich
[1:25:19] and increase with good and have need of
[1:25:22] nothing. But because of their condition,
[1:25:26] God has said they are poor, wretched,
[1:25:30] blind, naked,
[1:25:32] and they don't know why. They took the
[1:25:35] wealth of the world
[1:25:37] and they enriched themselves.
[1:25:41] They forgot about the work of God.
[1:25:45] They forgot why they are here on earth.
[1:25:49] Listen, you are not here to build big
[1:25:51] buildings.
[1:25:54] You are here so that you may live the
[1:25:56] purpose
[1:25:59] that God has placed you here.
[1:26:03] The purpose of this church
[1:26:05] is to find souls.
[1:26:09] That's the purpose of the ministry.
[1:26:12] That's even your life's purpose.
[1:26:16] Whatever you do, the law that I might
[1:26:18] find one more soul.
[1:26:21] What can I do to find one more soul?
[1:26:26] That is the purpose of the home.
[1:26:29] That's the purpose of the church. Is the
[1:26:31] purpose of the word. He sent his word
[1:26:35] for what? For what?
[1:26:39] &gt;&gt; For building buildings.
[1:26:42] Answer me, church.
[1:26:46] For what?
[1:26:48] He sent his word
[1:26:52] to bring the last one.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Forgotten the purpose of the work.
[1:26:59] Everybody cares about
[1:27:04] David never had a smartphone.
[1:27:08] David could not communicate with the
[1:27:10] whole world in one minute.
[1:27:15] as I'm speaking right now.
[1:27:18] Australia is hearing me.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; America is hearing me. German is
[1:27:22] hearing.
[1:27:23] &gt;&gt; Can you actually believe it?
[1:27:29] David never had that ability.
[1:27:33] We in our generation have that ability.
[1:27:37] What are you using it for?
[1:27:39] I say we have a cause.
[1:27:42] We have a reason to be here.
[1:27:45] Let us do it. Let us do more for the
[1:27:48] Lord.
[1:27:50] Let us be burdened for los.
[1:27:54] May God help us to understand this
[1:27:58] because we are here to go forward.
[1:28:01] The denominations are going behind.
[1:28:04] But you see the bride is moving on.
[1:28:08] The bride is moving on.
[1:28:10] Oh, brother Dan sung the song with
[1:28:12] brother Joel.
[1:28:14] Amen. I believe it. The church is moving
[1:28:16] on. The bride is moving on. Are you the
[1:28:20] bride?
[1:28:22] Where are we going? We are going to the
[1:28:25] rapture.
[1:28:27] That's what we being prepared for. We're
[1:28:30] being prepared for body change.
[1:28:34] Catch the vision.
[1:28:36] Tell your neighbor. Catch the vision.
[1:28:39] This is what it's all about.
[1:28:42] Whatever we are going to do, let's do it
[1:28:45] for that purpose.
[1:28:47] And then he says there are paid
[1:28:50] preachers,
[1:28:53] paid preachers,
[1:28:56] he's talking about this denomination and
[1:28:58] system that
[1:29:01] paid assistance,
[1:29:04] paid ministers of music.
[1:29:09] paid education
[1:29:12] and uh paid choirs,
[1:29:15] paid custodians,
[1:29:19] programs,
[1:29:21] entertainment,
[1:29:23] all costing great sums.
[1:29:30] But for all that, the power is
[1:29:32] decreasing.
[1:29:36] Yes, the church is rich
[1:29:39] but the power is not there.
[1:29:42] How can you say the power is there
[1:29:45] when sinners are not repenting?
[1:29:48] How can you say the power is there when
[1:29:51] sinners are increasing?
[1:29:54] When sin is increasing in the church
[1:29:57] says the power is gone.
[1:30:01] The glory is departed
[1:30:04] because God moves by his spirit
[1:30:08] not by the amount of money
[1:30:12] or talent in the church.
[1:30:14] I said God moves by his spirit.
[1:30:18] Let me tell you when God calls a man he
[1:30:22] gives him an assignment to go out and
[1:30:26] bring them in. go out to the streets to
[1:30:30] the byways and bring them in. It used to
[1:30:34] be young men on fire going on the
[1:30:38] street, going out to the hospital, going
[1:30:41] everywhere they could go in the school,
[1:30:44] evangelizing. They were in prayer. They
[1:30:47] were hungering. They wereing to see the
[1:30:51] move of God.
[1:30:54] But where is that? Churches big money,
[1:30:58] but you only have gossip in the church.
[1:31:02] Preachers
[1:31:04] are paid, pastors are paid, ministers
[1:31:07] are paid, there's more money, but so
[1:31:11] little accomplished.
[1:31:14] And people have come to a place, I'm
[1:31:17] afraid, the church has come to a place
[1:31:20] where there can be almost no one
[1:31:22] ministering
[1:31:25] without being paid.
[1:31:28] It is so sad.
[1:31:33] It's very sad, I tell you. But the
[1:31:35] spirit of the edge,
[1:31:37] but the bride is yet to break
[1:31:41] in this message. We still have men who
[1:31:44] will preach with or without a paycheck
[1:31:49] who are called to preach because of a
[1:31:53] burden
[1:31:55] who are doing what they are doing for
[1:31:57] the Lord because they have a calling of
[1:31:59] God upon their life
[1:32:03] whereby no man can stop them.
[1:32:08] I remember when one day in Ethiopia I
[1:32:11] drove 16 hours
[1:32:15] to go from
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; all the way to Ben Shangulang.
[1:32:22] That's a place near Sudan.
[1:32:27] &gt;&gt; And I drove that distance because I had
[1:32:30] I I got in contact with some young men
[1:32:32] at a university.
[1:32:35] I think about one or two that felt
[1:32:38] showed interest in the word
[1:32:42] and that's a long journey. That's a lot
[1:32:44] of money. But I told the church that I
[1:32:47] was pastoring in Adis that look I have
[1:32:49] to go there
[1:32:51] and until today I wonder how did I do
[1:32:54] that
[1:32:56] 15 hours nonstop
[1:32:59] must have been something more than
[1:33:01] physical power can do
[1:33:05] more than more than money can do.
[1:33:09] Something else was driving me.
[1:33:12] I remember we drove about 10 hours
[1:33:15] reach somewhere and you know I was so
[1:33:17] dizzy I was almost passing out
[1:33:21] because it is a small car bad road.
[1:33:24] I tell you we we when we came out right
[1:33:27] there we had a revival.
[1:33:29] We had a group I still have those
[1:33:30] pictures. We had a group of young people
[1:33:33] who came about 10 or 15 and we preached
[1:33:37] this message to them.
[1:33:39] We preached this message to them. We
[1:33:41] actually baptized some of them.
[1:33:43] Let me tell you, Amen. Those who refuse
[1:33:46] to hear that day,
[1:33:49] Amen. We will bear them witness. They
[1:33:51] will bear us witness. We preached.
[1:33:55] Let me tell you brother, there has to be
[1:33:57] something
[1:33:58] driving the church.
[1:34:01] Something unseen.
[1:34:03] Something more than money.
[1:34:06] Something that is so rich.
[1:34:09] Something that is so rich in our hearts.
[1:34:12] Amen. Something pushing us.
[1:34:14] Something making us to go forward.
[1:34:18] It can only be Christ.
[1:34:20] It can only be Jesus.
[1:34:23] He's a son of prosperity.
[1:34:25] He will keep us going forward.
[1:34:28] Moving forward
[1:34:31] cannot fail.
[1:34:34] There will be others who will give their
[1:34:37] substance
[1:34:39] their money to the work of God. Many
[1:34:41] times we want to do this, do that, do
[1:34:42] that.
[1:34:44] And people think when they give to the
[1:34:47] work of God, they helping the pastor.
[1:34:50] They're moving the pastor's idea.
[1:34:53] Oh, I feel so sorry for such a person.
[1:34:56] Let me tell you, brother, sister, we
[1:34:58] have a cause.
[1:35:01] You have to catch the vision.
[1:35:04] We are here for a reason. Mine might be
[1:35:06] to speak to you. Maybe yours is to pray.
[1:35:10] Maybe yours is to give money. Maybe
[1:35:12] yours is to do something.
[1:35:14] Do whatever you have to do.
[1:35:17] Let us go forward.
[1:35:20] Amen. Because this is a work of God. It
[1:35:24] has to move. It can only move by the
[1:35:27] spirit,
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; not by money.
[1:35:32] So whether you give or you do not give,
[1:35:35] the work of God can never fail.
[1:35:40] We need to have that understanding.
[1:35:43] As a church, as a body of believers in
[1:35:46] this end time, we have something to do.
[1:35:53] If you're a musician,
[1:35:56] that's your post of duty.
[1:35:58] Do it like you're going to die.
[1:36:01] If you're a preacher, preach like you
[1:36:02] are going to die.
[1:36:05] If they don't hear, you have done your
[1:36:07] job.
[1:36:10] Witness your neighbor like as if you're
[1:36:13] going to die.
[1:36:16] If you're an interpreter, interpret
[1:36:18] as if you're going to die. Do something
[1:36:22] and do it with all your might. If you're
[1:36:24] a singer, sing knowing you're not
[1:36:27] singing for people to hear your voice.
[1:36:31] You know the church is moving on.
[1:36:35] And he says, "Now I want to show you how
[1:36:38] diabolical this urge for money has
[1:36:40] become.
[1:36:44] The churches have gone all out to get a
[1:36:46] membership,
[1:36:48] especially of the wealthy.
[1:36:54] Churches in Africa are even beginning to
[1:36:57] start churches in in in in Europe and
[1:36:59] other places.
[1:37:04] What are they looking for? They're
[1:37:06] looking for the wealthy
[1:37:08] so that they can support their scheme.
[1:37:11] But I tell you friend, the church of
[1:37:14] Jesus is moving on.
[1:37:19] And it's not moving on by money.
[1:37:22] It's moving on by his spirit.
[1:37:24] The churches have gone all out to get a
[1:37:26] membership,
[1:37:29] especially for the wealthy.
[1:37:31] We are not we are not competing for
[1:37:33] membership.
[1:37:35] We have no law but love,
[1:37:38] no membership but fellowship,
[1:37:41] no but Christ. And I thank God for this
[1:37:45] message of the hour because we have been
[1:37:47] set loose.
[1:37:49] We have been loosened. We have been set
[1:37:52] free
[1:37:54] from all those churches that were so
[1:37:56] hungry for membership.
[1:38:00] We are not here so we can get a big
[1:38:03] membership.
[1:38:04] Whether you are 100, I'll preach.
[1:38:07] Whether you're 1,000, I will preach.
[1:38:10] When you become 10,000, I'll preach.
[1:38:13] If you are two, I'll still preach. And
[1:38:16] let me tell you, I will not change what
[1:38:18] I'm preaching.
[1:38:20] I'll preach it the way the word say.
[1:38:24] And I am not the only one. There are
[1:38:27] many like me all over the world that are
[1:38:30] anointed
[1:38:32] by God to preach this message of the
[1:38:35] hour to many of you.
[1:38:41] Praise God. My time is up. Let me try to
[1:38:44] finish now. Everywhere there is a cry to
[1:38:46] make a religion so attractive
[1:38:52] and appealing that the rich and cultured
[1:38:54] and all rather appealing that the rich
[1:38:56] and cultured and all who have worldly
[1:38:59] prestige will come in and and be active
[1:39:02] in the church.
[1:39:10] You know try to have a good media
[1:39:12] presence.
[1:39:16] This one copying this one and this one
[1:39:17] copying that one. This one saying I'm
[1:39:20] done. I'm doing the best and everything.
[1:39:23] May God help us. May we never do
[1:39:26] anything
[1:39:27] out of pressure.
[1:39:31] Let's do things out of the leadership of
[1:39:35] the Holy Spirit.
[1:39:38] Amen. Amen.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; We are not seeking to be like somebody
[1:39:41] else.
[1:39:43] seeking to be like Christ.
[1:39:47] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; Can they understand that if the if
[1:39:51] wealth is the criterion of spirituality,
[1:39:55] [Music]
[1:39:59] then the world already has God,
[1:40:04] has all of God,
[1:40:08] and the church has nothing.
[1:40:11] Because the world has more money than
[1:40:12] you.
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; So it's not money that measures how much
[1:40:16] of God you have.
[1:40:21] Thou say some increased with diamonds.
[1:40:25] This literally means I have spiritual
[1:40:26] riches.
[1:40:29] This sounds like the millennium with the
[1:40:30] with the with the streets of God and the
[1:40:32] presence of God.
[1:40:36] But I wonder if this is so. Is the
[1:40:39] church truly rich in the spiritual
[1:40:40] things of God?
[1:40:43] Let us examine this 20th century book
[1:40:48] in the light of the world.
[1:40:51] And we're going to do that examination
[1:40:53] on Sunday.
[1:40:56] But I tell you, friend, there's
[1:40:57] something you have to do.
[1:41:01] Be active in the work of God.
[1:41:06] If I was to die,
[1:41:08] I would want to be remembered
[1:41:11] as somebody who invested
[1:41:14] my time,
[1:41:16] my resources,
[1:41:18] my money, my family, my substance,
[1:41:23] everything that I had in the work of God
[1:41:29] would be a good legacy.
[1:41:34] What about you?
[1:41:36] Let's bow our heads tonight.
[1:41:39] Father Lord.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for this word
[1:41:44] that you've given to us. Lord help us
[1:41:48] that we may not stray away
[1:41:52] Lord. But we will run in this race
[1:41:56] that we will not bring you disgrace.
[1:41:59] Lord, help us that we will please you in
[1:42:04] all that we do.
[1:42:06] In all that we do. Lord Jesus,
[1:42:09] bless the people that have been
[1:42:10] listening in tonight,
[1:42:12] those live and those on Zoom and
[1:42:16] Father, just pray that your grace will
[1:42:20] abound in our hearts.

[1:42:31] [Applause]
[1:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can I have brother Amram come up?
[1:42:35] And we just want to if you can stand on
[1:42:37] your feet and
[1:42:40] Amen.

[1:57:09] the people.
[1:57:11] that they will they will have meaning in
[1:57:13] their hearts
[1:57:15] that you will convict us Lord
[1:57:19] that you will help us to please you in
[1:57:20] everything that we do.
[1:57:23] Granted, Lord, be with us now as we
[1:57:26] dismiss
[1:57:28] and bless everyone that has given Lord
[1:57:30] as we have given our offerings
[1:57:34] and may you prosper us Lord that we may
[1:57:37] continue serving you
[1:57:40] in Jesus mighty name we pray.
[1:57:43] Amen.
[1:57:46] [Music]
[1:57:48] The Lord bless you saints. Uh just
[1:57:51] wanted to um you can have your seat for
[1:57:54] just a minute or two.
[1:57:57] I just wanted to uh give an announcement
[1:57:59] or two.
[1:58:02] Um cuz I know that u there there could
[1:58:06] be those that are streaming or those who
[1:58:08] are here
[1:58:11] but we are not here on Sunday.
[1:58:14] We shall announce it again on Sunday.
[1:58:17] and also those who were here on Sunday.
[1:58:18] Some of you have misunderstood
[1:58:23] um regarding our land uh fund project.
[1:58:28] We thank God for the far he has brought
[1:58:30] us.
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. He's a he's a faithful God.
[1:58:37] And so to those who do not know, we we
[1:58:39] already found the land.
[1:58:44] We raised up to 100 million shillings.
[1:58:46] [Music]
[1:58:48] and I've already paid it.
[1:58:51] Now, um the land total sum is a total
[1:58:54] sum of 220 million
[1:59:00] and 500,000.
[1:59:03] So now we are remaining with 120 and
[1:59:06] 500,000.
[1:59:13] So now we are supposed to pay this
[1:59:15] money. We have an allowance of 12
[1:59:18] months.
[1:59:20] But we as a church are targeting to pay
[1:59:22] it in 6 months.
[1:59:25] To those who are wondering whether that
[1:59:26] is possible or not, I want to tell you
[1:59:28] it is possible.
[1:59:31] It's it's very possible
[1:59:34] only if we can work together.
[1:59:37] You know, united we stand,
[1:59:41] divided we fall.
[1:59:45] So let us stand together.
[1:59:47] Nothing is small.
[1:59:52] &gt;&gt; You enter into this inspiration and tell
[1:59:54] them don't interpret me. Just tell them
[1:59:56] and you will see the words coming.
[1:59:57] Nothing is small.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:00:01] &gt;&gt; Don't you worry. I'm teaching him how to
[2:00:03] interpret. And and he's a very good
[2:00:04] interpreter, isn't he?
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing is small.
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Nothing.
[2:00:10] and and do not undermine your giving
[2:00:14] because it is making a difference. Don't
[2:00:17] say 120 I mean million I've even never
[2:00:21] touched one million in my hand.
[2:00:25] We shall make it together.
[2:00:28] It is possible. So the plan is
[2:00:32] we want to as a church to pledge out all
[2:00:37] this money completely
[2:00:41] to pledge that completely
[2:00:44] so that we know it is fully pledged out.
[2:00:48] We know that if it was like a goat,
[2:00:52] if we went to out to hunt
[2:00:55] and we've brought out a god
[2:00:58] and now we we say here is a god
[2:01:02] everybody take a piece
[2:01:05] then you you see those who are taking
[2:01:06] big pieces small pieces Others
[2:01:10] will take a little leg
[2:01:13] but at the end everybody will take some
[2:01:16] and in a minute
[2:01:19] all of it will be divided across
[2:01:22] the whole congregation.
[2:01:25] That's the way that's the strategy we
[2:01:26] have.
[2:01:29] Let us pledge it out completely
[2:01:32] and then we begin
[2:01:35] collecting slowly.
[2:01:38] Already we have been collecting per
[2:01:39] week.
[2:01:41] So the confusion was people thought
[2:01:43] they're going to give per week and again
[2:01:45] pledge
[2:01:50] what you pledged
[2:01:54] whenever you pay per week.
[2:01:56] We have developed a system
[2:01:59] on the computer.
[2:02:01] Whatever and we are still in the process
[2:02:03] of finalizing it. Whatever you pay will
[2:02:08] automatically be reduced from your
[2:02:09] pledge.
[2:02:13] So um let's see whatever you have given
[2:02:17] this two past two weeks
[2:02:22] because we started this system these
[2:02:24] past two weeks.
[2:02:27] This is the third week. So, um, whatever
[2:02:30] you've given this past two weeks
[2:02:33] has already paid off from your total
[2:02:37] pledge.
[2:02:39] You understand? So, we have a total of
[2:02:42] about 75 million pledged for now.
[2:02:50] Quickly, someone count how much are we
[2:02:52] remaining with?
[2:02:56] 45
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; and the individuals who have pledged out
[2:03:01] the 75 are like about 50 or less.
[2:03:08] The rest of the 50 can really pledge out
[2:03:10] that very easily.
[2:03:14] Brother Steven, you pledged nothing.
[2:03:16] Brother Joel, you pledged nothing. My
[2:03:18] brother here, sister Rachel, you have
[2:03:20] pledged nothing. There are many who have
[2:03:21] pledged nothing here.
[2:03:24] And let me tell you, I was talking to my
[2:03:26] young people and I told them,
[2:03:29] you younger people,
[2:03:32] we are doing this for you,
[2:03:34] for your children.
[2:03:36] Those who think this is not possible.
[2:03:40] Pledge by faith and begin paying slowly.
[2:03:44] People will be surprised at an adult
[2:03:49] or 40 years will be surprised to see a
[2:03:52] child of 17 years
[2:03:55] that after one year they have paid 1
[2:03:58] million.
[2:04:00] You'll be surprised
[2:04:02] and it is going to happen. You wait and
[2:04:04] see.
[2:04:05] But how we're going to do it is uh every
[2:04:09] week you give
[2:04:12] &gt;&gt; as you are able.
[2:04:15] And in this case we are not competing.
[2:04:17] We this past 78 weeks we were looking at
[2:04:20] how many have given. Okay 7. Okay let me
[2:04:22] give 10.
[2:04:27] But now we are competing with our
[2:04:31] pledge.
[2:04:34] If I've pledged 10 million
[2:04:36] every week I can give 1 million 500,000
[2:04:40] 200,000. I don't care how much others
[2:04:42] I've given. So we are going to begin
[2:04:44] hearing here every week. Maybe you will
[2:04:46] find that every week 5 million 10
[2:04:50] million out of the collections. Why?
[2:04:54] Because people are paying their pledges.
[2:04:59] Let's do this friends and you'll be
[2:05:02] surprised. We will get this done within
[2:05:05] no time.
[2:05:08] Within no time. It is very much
[2:05:10] possible. A brother told me today
[2:05:14] pastor after we have finished this and
[2:05:16] it has worked
[2:05:19] people's eyes are going to open.
[2:05:22] Even those who have never saved 1
[2:05:23] million they will say ah in six months
[2:05:27] I've given 1 million to the work of God.
[2:05:29] It means I'm able also to do it and you
[2:05:32] will find them doing it for their own
[2:05:34] property.
[2:05:37] Amen. That's what we believe.
[2:05:40] So I just want to clarify that I will do
[2:05:42] that again on Sunday.
[2:05:46] First thing pledge
[2:05:48] through a group. If you're not a member
[2:05:50] of any group, join a group.
[2:05:54] Yeah. Join a group. We have seven
[2:05:55] groups. Join one of those groups and
[2:05:59] pledge in one of those groups.
[2:06:02] And some people have been saying, "Oh,
[2:06:03] now me I don't want to pledge."
[2:06:06] I'm fearing pledge.
[2:06:09] Fear is of the devil.
[2:06:12] Don't fear.
[2:06:14] Don't fear.
[2:06:17] One of these days, I don't know if if
[2:06:19] I'll see how I'm feeling on Sunday.
[2:06:24] There is something I want to share with
[2:06:25] you
[2:06:27] regarding the revelation of giving.
[2:06:31] I'll see. Just pray for me. Then we'll
[2:06:34] see how the Lord will lead me on Sunday.
[2:06:37] We need to just cash the revenge.
[2:06:41] So don't fear. Someone said, "I I don't
[2:06:43] want to give but yet every they don't
[2:06:45] want to pledge. Yet every week they've
[2:06:47] been given 20,000 and above
[2:06:53] and it was possible
[2:06:55] for 78 weeks.
[2:06:58] You understand? And uh so it is possible
[2:07:01] don't fear
[2:07:03] to pledge out 2 million 1 million 1.5
[2:07:08] you just take it and multiply it by
[2:07:09] weeks divides it in six months you will
[2:07:14] see it is possible
[2:07:16] very much possible you just have to be
[2:07:18] consistent
[2:07:21] and um God is training us for something
[2:07:25] there is more in the store for us
[2:07:28] more in store for us God bless you
[2:07:30] saints you're dismissed in Jesus
[2:07:36] Come
[2:07:38] that love the Lord and let our joys be
[2:07:44] known.

[2:07:51] Join in a song with sweet.
[2:07:57] and down
[2:08:00] around the throne and dance around the
[2:08:06] throne.
