[25:50] jesus christ
[26:07] we are happy to be able to speak to you
[26:09] today
[26:10] and we are coming to bring to you the
[26:13] message of the
[26:13] hour yes
[26:21] as many of you already know we are
[26:22] living in the end time
[26:24] where most of the signs that the bible
[26:28] speaks of have already come to pass
[26:35] [Music]
[26:55] at a time when coronavirus has already
[26:58] gone all over the world and many people
[26:59] are dying
[27:00] yeah corona virus
[27:04] i don't know surely we cannot doubt that
[27:07] we are living
[27:08] at the time that was promised to be the
[27:10] end salah
[27:16] jesus christ is about to come back the
[27:18] second time and rupture his bride
[27:20] yes waiting right away jesus christ
[27:25] according to faster than chapter four
[27:28] and yet
[27:30] there will be a catching away of the
[27:32] bride
[27:36] we are at that time he's coming back
[27:40] anytime soon
[27:44] and the question is to look with the
[27:46] yaki again
[27:50] we are bringing to you the end time
[27:52] message
[27:55] the message that would prepare the bride
[27:57] of jesus christ
[27:58] for the coming of the lord
[28:11] and if you you take your time and follow
[28:14] us closely i believe that the lord
[28:16] will reveal this to you to your heart
[28:25] we're gonna take isaiah chapter 61 verse
[28:28] one to two yeah
[28:41] the spirit of the lord god is upon me
[28:43] because the lord has anointed me to
[28:44] preach good tidings unto the meek
[28:47] he has sent me to bind up the
[28:48] broken-hearted to proclaim liberty to
[28:50] the captives
[28:52] and the opening of the prison to them
[28:54] that are bound
[28:55] to proclaim the acceptable year of the
[28:57] lord and
[28:58] the day of vengeance of our god to
[29:00] comfort all that morn
[29:15] [Music]
[29:25] now this was a prophecy by prophet
[29:28] isaiah speaking of the coming
[29:30] of the lord
[29:38] if you notice when jesus christ came the
[29:40] the
[29:41] he was given the book uh the prophet
[29:44] isaiah's
[29:45] in the temple and this is the exact
[29:47] scripture he went through
[29:51] a baby
[30:00] i want us to first compare this prophecy
[30:03] of isaiah
[30:05] with the place that is is written in the
[30:08] book of luke chapter four
[30:09] where jesus the bible records that he
[30:12] took the book and read and we want to
[30:14] see what he read
[30:15] compared to what was written in the book
[30:17] of isaiah
[30:38] and there was delivered unto him the
[30:40] book of prophet isaiah
[30:42] and when he had opened the book he found
[30:44] a place where it was written
[30:46] the spirit of the lord is upon me
[30:47] because he has anointed me to preach the
[30:49] gospel to the poor
[30:50] he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted
[30:53] to preach deliverance to the captives
[30:55] and
[30:55] the recovering of sight to the uh the
[30:58] blind
[30:58] to set a liberty to them that are
[31:00] breezed to preach the acceptable year of
[31:02] the lord
[31:03] and he closed the book and gave it to
[31:06] again to the minister and sat down and
[31:07] all the eyes
[31:09] of all of them that were in the
[31:10] synagogue were fastened on him
[31:12] and he began to say unto them listen to
[31:14] what he said
[31:15] this day is this scripture fulfilled in
[31:18] your ears
[31:30] and capitalism
[31:55] if there was something that jesus knew
[31:58] how to do
[31:59] was to allocate his place in the
[32:01] scripture
[32:10] you notice when they took the prophecy
[32:13] of isaiah
[32:14] he was able to read the exact path that
[32:17] was speaking about his first coming
[32:19] at that time
[32:32] and he left out the other part that was
[32:34] speaking about
[32:35] he's coming but this time the second
[32:38] coming
[32:40] albertan
[32:44] [Music]
[32:46] if you look at verse 2 of isaiah where
[32:49] we read
[32:50] he says to proclaim the acceptable year
[32:52] of the lord and
[32:54] the day of vengeance of our god and to
[32:56] comfort all that morning
[32:57] yes
[33:06] but jesus did not finish this verse
[33:12] [Music]
[33:14] in luke 14 in luke chapter 4 rather
[33:16] verse 19 he says
[33:17] to preach the acceptability of the lord
[33:20] and he puts a full stop
[33:21] ow lukas miranda
[33:32] and then he said he crossed the book he
[33:34] said this
[33:35] that you have had in your ears is
[33:48] the first coming of jesus was to declare
[33:50] the acceptable year of the lord
[33:59] it was to preach the good tidings to the
[34:01] make and
[34:03] letter
[34:16] and of course we were all slaves being
[34:19] that we were born in sin
[34:25] so the death of jesus christ on the
[34:26] cross declared the year of
[34:29] freedom for all the human race as long
[34:32] as they would believe
[34:40] and we noticed that that was all that he
[34:43] did the first coming he died for us on
[34:45] the cross
[34:46] and that was the the reason why he came
[34:49] back
[34:56] and so he left out that other part which
[34:58] says and
[34:59] the day of vengeance
[35:29] the coming of the lord
[35:37] that prophecy is fulfilled but in part
[35:55] he never wants anyone to miss his coming
[35:58] uh
[35:58] jesus man memphis
[36:02] disaster and that is why before he comes
[36:06] he sends elijah the prophet celestino
[36:10] commenter
[36:19] and so we want to talk to you about the
[36:22] coming of elijah
[36:24] in connection to the coming of the lord
[36:34] and we'll just go straight away to the
[36:35] prophecy of the coming of elijah
[36:37] in malachi chapter four
[36:46] he says behold i'll send you elijah the
[36:48] prophet before the coming of the great
[36:50] and dreadful day of the lord and they
[36:53] shall turn the hearts of the fathers to
[36:54] the children and the hearts of the
[36:55] children to their fathers
[36:56] lest i come and smite their earth with
[36:58] the curse
[37:15] elijah is going to come before the
[37:17] before the coming of the great
[37:19] and dreadful day
[37:32] christianity today believes this verse
[37:35] but they believe
[37:36] it only in the past that your it is
[37:38] already fulfilled through the ministry
[37:39] of john the baptist
[38:01] and you know how he wrestled and fought
[38:02] jezebel
[38:17] had the spirit of elijah on him
[38:22] so we can say that elisha was a man with
[38:25] the spirit of elijah
[38:27] memphis something i should also notice
[38:31] after elijah the dish bite the rest of
[38:33] them
[38:34] is really the spirit of elijah on a man
[38:57] this prophecy in malacca
[39:40] and those will be the two witnesses that
[39:42] will uh awaken or their message
[39:44] will call out the 144 thousand jews
[40:12] we know the one that is going to come we
[40:15] know that the last one the fifth one
[40:17] will go to
[40:18] the jews
[40:34] it says behold i'll send you elijah the
[40:37] prophet before the coming of the great
[40:39] and dreadful day of the lord
[40:46] so these two elijahs
[40:49] are going to come each one is going to
[40:52] come before the dreadful day of the lord
[40:53] and the other is going to come before
[40:55] the
[40:56] the great day of the lord
[41:05] now we can say that the first coming of
[41:07] jesus was great but we cannot call it
[41:09] dreadful
[41:11] jesus christ
[41:14] it was a day of joy destiny
[41:18] of
[41:25] 3 verse 16 says for god so loved the
[41:28] world that he gave his only begotten son
[41:30] that whosoever believeth in him should
[41:32] not perish but have everlasting
[41:34] life
[41:42] that was a great day yeah it would be
[41:45] two women
[41:57] i would like us to track it down to luke
[42:00] chapter 1 verse 13.
[42:05] okay
[42:08] in the mighty fella says but the angel
[42:10] said unto me
[42:11] to him fear not the carriers for thy
[42:14] prayer is hard
[42:15] and thy wife elizabeth shall bear thee a
[42:16] son and thou shalt call his name john
[42:19] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[42:20] many shall rejoice at his birth
[42:23] for he shall be great in the sight of
[42:25] the lord and shall drink neither wine no
[42:26] strong drink
[42:27] and it shall be filled with the holy
[42:28] ghost even from his mother's womb and
[42:30] many of the children of israel
[42:32] shall he now listen to this shall he
[42:34] turn to the lord
[42:36] their god and he shall go before him in
[42:38] the spirit and power of elias
[42:40] to turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[42:41] children and the disobedient to the
[42:43] wisdom of the just
[42:44] to make ready our people prepared for
[42:46] the lord
[42:56] foreign
[43:37] it says when he comes elijah is going to
[43:39] turn
[43:40] the hearts of the fathers to the
[43:41] children number one and then number two
[43:44] he says the hearts of the children
[43:45] to the fathers
[43:52] memphis
[44:08] and then he says now let's read it this
[44:11] way that i'll send you elijah
[44:14] before the great day of the lord and he
[44:16] will turn the hearts of the fathers
[44:18] to the children uh
[44:36] can we now read when you read verse five
[44:38] do not mention dreadful day for them to
[44:40] understand he says
[44:41] that i'll send you elijah before the
[44:43] coming of the great
[44:44] day of the lord yes
[45:01] and if you notice in the book of luke
[45:03] and not lucas marath like
[45:05] dominic no the bible says that john's
[45:08] ministry
[45:09] was going to turn the children of
[45:11] israel's hearts
[45:13] to the lord their god
[45:16] is
[45:31] ministry was to the jews the fathers of
[45:35] the law
[45:36] to to turn their hearts or to introduce
[45:39] jesus christ to them
[45:55] according to the bible it only prepared
[45:59] the coming of the messiah the people's
[46:01] hearts for the coming of the lord
[46:10] whenever we talk about john remember the
[46:12] word prepare
[46:27] actually even in isaiah 4 4 40 verse 3
[46:31] says the voice of him that christ in the
[46:32] wilderness prepare ye the way of the
[46:34] lord
[46:35] make straight in the desert a highway
[46:37] for our god
[46:40] is
[47:20] when john introduced jesus christ behold
[47:22] the lamb of god that takes away the sins
[47:23] of the world
[47:24] his ministry stopped there
[47:36] foreign
[47:39] and therefore what we are trying to say
[47:41] is that the prophecy of
[47:43] malachi speaks of john but in part
[48:18] isaiah called it the day of vengeance of
[48:21] our god.
[48:26] i called it the dreadful day of the lord
[48:32] in other places it says the day that
[48:33] shall ban us as an oven
[48:36] [Music]
[48:40] you see so that is not the first coming
[48:43] of jesus
[48:46] christ and notice
[48:49] on verse six he also says and the heart
[48:51] of the children to their fathers
[48:53] so this one that would come before the
[48:57] uh the the dreadful of the lord would
[48:59] turn the hearts of the
[49:01] of the children to their fathers
[49:11] and by the way when he says fathers to
[49:13] children or children to fathers this is
[49:14] not meaning father-son relationships
[49:26] the first fathers to children only is
[49:30] indicating the fathers of the law the
[49:32] jews the pharisees and the disease
[49:35] who were under the law that john's
[49:38] ministry would turn them
[49:40] uh or would introduce jesus christ to
[49:41] them now yeah about
[49:56] [Music]
[50:01] and the heart of the children to their
[50:03] fathers this one is indicating the
[50:05] children of god those who have received
[50:07] the holy ghost from the day of pentecost
[50:09] they are called children
[50:24] you are the child of god
[50:30] the bible says when we receive the
[50:31] spirit of christ in our hearts we cry
[50:33] our father
[51:05] another coming of elijah before the
[51:07] second coming of jesus
[51:09] christ
[51:17] remember the coming of elijah is always
[51:19] connected to the coming of the lord
[51:23] yes
[51:29] if you notice the people who received uh
[51:32] elijah's ministry as john
[51:34] they also
[52:00] and his disciples asked him saying why
[52:02] then say the scribes that
[52:03] elias must first come and jesus answered
[52:06] and said unto them
[52:07] elias truly shall first come and restore
[52:10] all things
[52:11] but i say unto you that elias has come
[52:13] already and they knew him not but have
[52:15] done unto him whatsoever they listed
[52:16] likewise shall also the son of man
[52:18] suffer of them then the disciples
[52:20] understood that he spoke unto them of
[52:22] john the baptist
[52:23] [Music]
[52:57] the disciples had watched jesus at the
[52:59] moment of transfiguration
[53:06] and they saw him transfigured with
[53:09] moses and with elijah
[53:12] now
[53:27] how moses was representing those that
[53:28] were dead in christ
[53:30] and elijah was representing those that
[53:33] are alive and remain
[53:36] [Music]
[53:40] s
[53:48] as i mentioned to you a while a while
[53:50] ago uh chapter four
[53:51] he says that um at the at the sounding
[53:55] of the
[53:55] last trump of god the dead in christ
[53:57] shall rise fast
[53:59] then we which are alive and remain shall
[54:01] be caught up
[54:02] together and we meet the lord in the air
[54:21] [Music]
[54:32] when the disciples saw jesus
[54:34] transfigured in that cloud
[54:36] with moses
[54:42] and so the disciples received the
[54:45] revelation that this was the messiah
[54:47] that was standing right before them
[54:59] elijah to come before you and here you
[55:01] are where is elijah according to the
[55:03] prophecy
[55:04] and now uh
[55:15] [Music]
[55:18] elijah had come and that was john but
[55:20] they had missed him
[55:27] he had come and gone and they had missed
[55:29] him
[55:32] but when
[55:39] he says and jesus answered and said unto
[55:41] them elias truly
[55:42] shall first come together
[55:53] [Music]
[56:05] and so he was speaking of the elijah
[56:08] that was going to come before
[56:09] his second coming before the messiah's
[56:12] second coming the dreadful day of the
[56:14] lord
[56:23] and you remember that the elijah that
[56:25] came before the great day of the lord
[56:27] who was john
[56:28] did not restore he only prepared them
[56:33] okay
[56:40] but here we see a new word
[56:56] this man upon whom the spirit of elijah
[56:58] would be
[57:00] will not uh will do more than what john
[57:04] did
[57:04] he will restore all things
[57:22] means to bring back something
[57:43] and so this elijah coming before the
[57:44] second coming of jesus christ his
[57:46] ministry
[57:47] will be concentrating on restoring
[57:51] all things
[58:04] and what are those things that are going
[58:06] to be restored
[58:12] for restoring those things
[58:17] this is what i want us to talk about
[58:20] the purpose
[59:28] [Music]
[59:31] exactly what he has promised he must
[59:34] fulfill
[59:34] you born with me
[59:38] and remember he said he's going to come
[59:39] and take a church or rapture a church
[59:42] without sport or wrinkle washed in the
[59:44] blood of the lamb
[59:57] a spotless church yeah
[1:00:09] the bible says let us be glad and
[1:00:11] rejoice for the marriage of the lamb is
[1:00:13] come
[1:00:14] and his wife has made herself ready
[1:00:22] there is only one there's only one thing
[1:00:25] that would make that bride ready
[1:00:40] it's going to be a special ministry
[1:00:45] but it's not best in any denomination
[1:00:49] that's not going to start any
[1:00:51] denominations
[1:00:55] but that ministry will speak nothing but
[1:00:56] the word of god yeah
[1:00:58] yes
[1:01:01] god has always worked that way
[1:01:04] from the days of noah but canosa when he
[1:01:07] said no he didn't send him out of
[1:01:10] any of the established denominations of
[1:01:11] that time
[1:01:18] but noah had that saved the lord
[1:01:36] do you know the day you are living
[1:01:44] my friends it's later than you think
[1:01:50] the coming of the lord is here yeah
[1:01:54] the message of restoration is already
[1:01:56] here
[1:01:57] yes elijah is come
[1:02:01] elias method remember is coming to the
[1:02:03] church to restore
[1:02:04] the hearts of the children back to their
[1:02:06] fathers
[1:02:10] listen we are the children of god and
[1:02:13] yeah exactly
[1:02:14] we the church christian i'm not talking
[1:02:17] about denominations i'm talking about
[1:02:18] the church the body of jesus christ all
[1:02:20] over the world
[1:02:27] every denomination has its own doctrine
[1:02:30] don't drink
[1:02:32] it
[1:02:58] the way for us to know that he is that
[1:03:00] who was spoken of
[1:03:03] again
[1:03:12] because the bible says that in the end
[1:03:14] time there shall be many false prophets
[1:03:21] they shall perform many signs many
[1:03:22] wonders many miracles
[1:03:24] lying wonders
[1:03:43] this elijah in the end time will be a
[1:03:45] word
[1:03:46] prophet
[1:03:52] and his ministry will be restoring us
[1:03:56] yes
[1:04:07] you have many instructors in christ but
[1:04:10] you don't have
[1:04:27] [Music]
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:36] just like as you know in taipei israel
[1:05:39] left egypt
[1:05:47] but not all those that left egypt went
[1:05:50] to the promised land
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:58] many died in the desert
[1:06:02] so they were
[1:06:15] you know the word church means they're
[1:06:16] called out ones to be the christians
[1:06:20] so we are all called out of the world
[1:06:22] believe jesus christ
[1:06:30] god has the
[1:06:56] today is he that will hear the message
[1:06:59] of this anytime elijah
[1:07:02] yes
[1:07:08] this message will prepare them for the
[1:07:09] coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:07:14] this message will uh you know cut off
[1:07:17] every man-made dogma
[1:07:18] creed all traditions and restore them
[1:07:21] back again to the foundations and the
[1:07:23] principles
[1:07:24] of the word of god yet
[1:07:44] there is no ministry that has has been
[1:07:46] spoken
[1:07:47] of in this generation and in the
[1:07:49] generations before us
[1:07:51] than the ministry of william marion
[1:07:54] branham
[1:08:09] and many have said whatever they had to
[1:08:12] say about the ministry
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:18] but we've been convinced that that is
[1:08:21] the ministry that
[1:08:22] fits the scripture according to the
[1:08:24] prophecy of malachi 4.
[1:08:27] [Music]
[1:08:33] [Music]
[1:08:36] um
[1:09:01] if you want to know more about the
[1:09:02] ministry of the man you can
[1:09:04] write to us or let us know we will be
[1:09:07] sure to send you books
[1:09:08] or to answer your questions
[1:09:18] um
[1:09:26] but i'd like to go ahead and show you
[1:09:30] those things that this ministry
[1:09:39] [Music]
[1:10:00] b
[1:10:05] well praise the lord uh i just
[1:10:08] believe that that was a blessing to you
[1:10:12] uh if you can switch on your videos that
[1:10:14] would be wonderful that would be nice
[1:10:17] uh now we are planning to by the grace
[1:10:20] of god
[1:10:21] of course we recorded a few videos after
[1:10:24] that if you want to
[1:10:26] uh get to them we had a video on water
[1:10:28] baptism
[1:10:30] also one on uh the
[1:10:33] uh modesty and women preachers and
[1:10:38] several other videos as well as
[1:10:41] [Music]
[1:10:42] uh the one on godhead now uh
[1:10:46] you might not have watched that and if
[1:10:47] you want to watch it
[1:10:49] just type in on youtube the message site
[1:10:52] without leaving a space the message site
[1:10:54] and then it will come up and you'll be
[1:10:56] able to get those videos
[1:10:58] but uh now for our fellowship here
[1:11:01] uh i know that there might be some with
[1:11:04] questions
[1:11:05] on this subject or on this specific
[1:11:07] subject
[1:11:08] maybe something that has been said now
[1:11:10] or something that has say
[1:11:12] has been said uh previously in the
[1:11:15] fellowship in the church here
[1:11:17] uh or the church that you attended
[1:11:19] before on this subject of
[1:11:21] of uh elijah or the coming of a legend
[1:11:23] or generation
[1:11:25] uh i think this is a good opportunity
[1:11:28] for us to
[1:11:29] have a few minutes uh a few minutes i
[1:11:32] know that there might be some people
[1:11:33] with patients
[1:11:34] even those that are already believers
[1:11:36] and maybe it's something that you want
[1:11:38] to ask
[1:11:38] maybe not for you but for someone else i
[1:11:41] think this is a good opportunity for us
[1:11:43] to be able to do that
[1:11:44] um and before you do that before you ask
[1:11:48] your questions
[1:11:49] something that i want to make to make uh
[1:11:54] you know known to us is that when we
[1:11:57] talk about the coming of elijah
[1:11:59] we are not really the purpose is not for
[1:12:02] us to talk about the man elijah
[1:12:04] or the man who will have a spirit of
[1:12:06] elijah upon him
[1:12:08] but the purpose is to talk about a
[1:12:11] ministry
[1:12:12] which is going to come to prepare
[1:12:16] the people for the coming of the lord
[1:12:18] because everybody
[1:12:19] in the church world knows about the
[1:12:21] coming of jesus they all talk about the
[1:12:23] coming of jesus christ and they believe
[1:12:25] in the coming of our lord jesus christ
[1:12:27] but they do not know that he will come
[1:12:31] and they will know nothing about it and
[1:12:33] he is coming
[1:12:34] is imperative he has to come he must
[1:12:36] come even according to
[1:12:38] the prophecy the the lord jesus christ
[1:12:41] is going to come back again
[1:12:43] but he is not going to come again
[1:12:46] before a ministry that is going to
[1:12:48] prepare the people's hearts for his
[1:12:50] coming
[1:12:50] comes and this ministry is that which
[1:12:53] was promised it has already come
[1:12:55] we have received that elijah we have
[1:12:57] received that ministry
[1:12:58] and our hearts are being prepared
[1:13:00] already and uh
[1:13:01] any time we believe that the lord jesus
[1:13:03] christ is coming to rupture he's waiting
[1:13:05] bride
[1:13:06] away praise the name of the lord amen
[1:13:09] now
[1:13:10] i i i think i'll be ready for to take
[1:13:12] questions i see several of you
[1:13:15] uh here on youtube
[1:13:18] uh is a few i've also been on
[1:13:21] on on youtube those of you here on zoom
[1:13:25] uh i think i'll take one by one as as it
[1:13:28] comes
[1:13:29] before we we get disconnected maybe i'll
[1:13:31] begin from you
[1:13:32] here or whoever is if those of you who
[1:13:35] are not
[1:13:36] on zoom and you love to switch on your
[1:13:38] video i think
[1:13:39] i would so much appreciate that
[1:13:46] okay so if you want to unmute yourself
[1:13:51] you can go ahead and undo that
[1:13:58] okay do we have anyone with a question
[1:14:12] yes
[1:14:53] okay i'm waiting with someone with a
[1:14:56] question
[1:15:05] i know that many people are new to this
[1:15:07] maybe they do not know how to unmute
[1:15:09] themselves
[1:15:10] so i'm trying to
[1:15:21] and by the way we are going to be doing
[1:15:23] uh quite several videos
[1:15:25] uh for you and
[1:15:28] uh for for outreach
[1:15:32] so we are going to be doing that from

[1:15:45] the previous videos that we we did
[1:15:47] and met a few ministers that have had
[1:15:51] this message for their first time and i
[1:15:54] believe that it will have
[1:15:55] to continue to have a great impact all
[1:15:58] right
[1:15:59] do you have some questions here
[1:16:24] okay i think that there is no one with a
