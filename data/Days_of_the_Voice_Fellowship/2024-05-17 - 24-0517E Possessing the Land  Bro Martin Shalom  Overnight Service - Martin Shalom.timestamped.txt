[4:52] knives and circumcise again the children
[4:54] of Israel the second
[4:56] time and Joshua made uh made him sharp
[5:00] knives and circumcised the children of
[5:02] Israel at at the at the the hill the
[5:06] hill of the forest skin and this is the
[5:10] cause why Joshua did circumcise all the
[5:13] people that came out of Egypt that were
[5:17] male even all the men of War died in the
[5:22] wilderness by the way after they came
[5:25] out of Egypt now all the people that
[5:27] came out were were circumcised but all
[5:31] the people that were born in the
[5:33] wilderness by the way
[5:36] as as they came forth out of Egypt they
[5:41] came forth out of Egypt then them they
[5:45] had not circumcised for the children of
[5:47] Israel walked 40 years in the wilderness
[5:50] till all the people that were Men of War
[5:52] which came out of Egypt were consumed
[5:55] because they obeyed not the voice of the
[5:58] Lord unto whom whom the Lord swear that
[6:01] he would not show them the land which
[6:03] the Lord swear unto their father that he
[6:07] would give us a land that floweth with
[6:11] milk and honey and their children whom
[6:15] uh he raised up in state in their state
[6:19] them josa circumcised for they were
[6:22] uncircumcised because they had not
[6:27] circumcised them by the way it came to
[6:30] pass when they had done
[6:32] circumcising that all the people that
[6:35] they Abode in their places in the camp
[6:39] till they were whole and the Lord said
[6:41] unto 1 verse 6

[12:43] their seed after them there is a
[12:48] land which God had sweared unto the unto
[12:52] their
[12:54] fathers the Father
[12:56] Abraham Isaac Jacob
[12:59] to give theion of Israelite amen and God
[13:03] is reminding them and today I'm also
[13:07] reminding you that there is a
[13:10] land blessed be the name of the Lord
[13:13] which you and me have got to
[13:18] possess and if you read this message so
[13:21] far I don't know how many you have read
[13:23] but all the message that I have read so
[13:25] far point us to this land
[13:30] and that's why once in a while or if not
[13:33] every time we need to remind ourself
[13:35] about that land because when God came
[13:39] down to remind Israelite brother Paul
[13:43] amen
[13:46] about their
[13:48] promise the church has a promise in this
[13:51] last hour we have the promise of the
[13:54] Rapture amen and we know that Christ is
[13:57] coming to take the church without spot
[13:59] or wrinkle and we know that the church
[14:03] the going of the church it is in process
[14:06] blessed with the name of the Lord
[14:10] amen we know that the bride is being
[14:12] prepared by the preaching of the
[14:15] word praise be to
[14:18] God if you feel you are dozing I reest
[14:21] you to
[14:23] stand even if the whole church stand it
[14:25] is okay provid that you are listening
[14:29] and you are
[14:31] swallowing blessed be the name of the
[14:34] Lord and you hardly find normally people
[14:38] who does in
[14:48] church praise be to
[14:52] God it is sinen to those in church it is
[14:57] Unbecoming it is disrespect respect to
[15:00] those in
[15:03] church blessed be the name of the
[15:10] Lord God is speaking and you are
[15:14] dozing and you are deceived that you're
[15:17] going to God's
[15:20] heaven may God help us blessed be the
[15:23] name of the
[15:25] Lord when you are going to God's heaven
[15:28] you must be sober because he said be
[15:31] sober and
[15:35] Vigilant praise be to God it is the
[15:38] devil the devil is the one who does this
[15:40] in
[15:41] church because the word BS the
[15:46] devil it's none of his business when
[15:49] he's in church he has no business there
[15:52] he will try amen he has to make you do
[15:55] and when you go out he keeps you active
[15:58] doing the
[16:00] opposite blessed be the name of the Lord
[16:04] a serious Christian cannot dose in
[16:09] church a real believer will not dose in
[16:13] church why did you leave your bed to
[16:16] come
[16:17] here you have a nice bed and blessed be
[16:21] the name of the Lord yeah what I'm
[16:24] trying to say do not allow the devil to
[16:26] use that b and I know the devil is not a
[16:28] Happ
[16:29] about what we are talking about because
[16:32] the life of the Christian is the Holy
[16:35] Spirit the holy spirit is our Promised
[16:38] Land blessed be the name of the Lord
[16:42] after all our struggle and all our
[16:45] battles we know that there is a land
[16:48] that God has prepared for us and God
[16:52] told them he reminded them about that
[16:55] land and he told them go in
[17:00] and possess the
[17:03] land this land is supposed to be
[17:06] possessed by
[17:08] individuals you cannot sit at home and
[17:11] your father God and possess for you the
[17:12] land blessed be the name of the Lord
[17:15] because each one of us has his
[17:27] position that's why God designed it in
[17:30] the way that even your father cannot
[17:33] possess for
[17:35] you neither you are mother you have to
[17:39] go
[17:41] possess for
[17:43] yourself that's why when God came down
[17:46] uh that's why uh calb went to Joshua and
[17:51] told
[17:52] him give me my
[17:55] Mountain the Lord promised us for 40
[17:59] years ago I'm still having the same
[18:02] strength just show me give me my
[18:05] Mountain blessed be the name of the Lord
[18:08] I'm going to quote in this message the
[18:10] prophet tells
[18:11] us that uh the trouble of it is with
[18:16] people today they are trying to depend
[18:20] on experience they had about 20 years
[18:26] ago you know what happened and to that
[18:30] manner it got wiggle taals in it
[18:43] overnight we must get experience we must
[18:46] be getting experience almost every day
[18:49] blessed be the name of the Lord and the
[18:52] prophet say the trouble with the people
[18:53] today they are trying to depend on
[18:55] unexperienced
[18:56] but there are those who have never even
[18:59] gotten an
[19:03] experience praise be to
[19:06] God and at that
[19:10] time at that same time that this devil
[19:15] falls out of heaven and became incarnate
[19:18] in
[19:19] man the Holy Spirit goes up and came
[19:23] down incarnate incarnate man amen oh my
[19:29] what a
[19:34] Time blessed be the name of the
[19:38] Lord amen
[20:00] go in and possess the land you cannot
[20:04] possess the land from
[20:05] out we must go in blessed be the name of
[20:09] the Lord amen and uh here in Joshua
[20:13] where we read Joshua chapter 5 it says
[20:16] that
[20:17] uh this is chapter
[20:22] 311 chapter 3:
[20:26] 11 it says that behold the Ark of the
[20:30] Covenant of the
[20:32] Lord of all the Earth passes over before
[20:36] you into Jordan now therefore take you
[20:40] 12 men out of the tribe of Israel out of
[20:44] every tribe a man and shall come to pass
[20:47] as soon as the soul of the feet of the
[20:50] priest that bear the Ark of the Lord the
[20:53] lord of the all the Earth shall rest in
[20:57] the waters of Jordan that the the Waters
[20:59] of Jordan shall be cut out from the
[21:01] waters that came down from above and
[21:05] they shall stand upon an hip and it came
[21:10] to pass when the people removed from
[21:13] their tent tend to pass over Jordan and
[21:17] the priest bearing the Ark of the
[21:19] Covenant before the people and as they
[21:22] that bear the ark where came into Jordan
[21:25] that the feet of the priest that bear
[21:27] the ark were in the brim of water of
[21:30] Jordan overflow of all his Banks all the
[21:35] time of the Harvest that the water which
[21:37] came down from above stood and Rose
[21:40] up and Rose up and Heap very far from
[21:45] the city Adam that is
[21:49] beside
[21:55] amen and the time and here in chapter 5
[21:59] you say at that time the Lord said unto
[22:02] Joshua make thee a sharp knife blessed
[22:06] be the name of the Lord when God called
[22:09] Israelites in their Journey to the
[22:11] promised
[22:14] land ah they started their
[22:17] Journey God gave them the promise but
[22:20] the Bible tells us that of all those who
[22:24] came the two million who came out of
[22:26] Egypt is only the two who made it the
[22:29] promised land and out of the two that
[22:32] was Joshua and
[22:34] calb and then apart from it's only those
[22:38] who were born in the wilderness they the
[22:40] one who made it to the promised land
[22:43] amen with are two the from the old
[22:47] generation and the prophet tells us that
[22:49] uh the reason asked why they are cut off
[22:52] we know it's because they disbelieved
[22:56] God when they rebelled against God and
[22:59] against Moses and they doubted God they
[23:02] murmured against Moses they murmured
[23:05] against
[23:06] God and God became annoyed with them
[23:10] until God even decided to destroy them
[23:14] in the bible say that Moses stood
[23:16] between them and God and said that what
[23:19] will the world say what will other
[23:22] nations say that you are not even able
[23:24] to deliver them blessed be the name of
[23:27] the Lord I want us to see something
[23:38] here but still they perish in the
[23:43] wilderness blessed be the name of the
[23:46] Lord God had to make them roam in the
[23:50] wilderness for another 40 years
[23:54] amen until all those who came out of
[23:58] Egypt
[23:59] where no more to be seen blessed be the
[24:02] name of the
[24:03] Lord
[24:05] K if you look at like uh look at
[24:09] Ahab when Ahab killed
[24:14] nabo you remember the plot how Jezebel
[24:18] nabo had a very nice land piece of land
[24:22] and uh Ahab admired it he wanted this
[24:26] man to sell him that piece of land
[24:29] and the man refused told him I cannot
[24:31] sell my
[24:32] inheritance and the bible say that Ahab
[24:35] went home and he was so sad in his heart
[24:39] and maybe Jezebel had gone to The
[24:42] Women's Circle from
[24:47] saving
[24:55] amen so when she came home she B the
[24:58] husband was so sad and asked the king
[25:01] what is wrong with you said na has
[25:04] refused to sell me his land said what
[25:07] kind of King is you you the holy
[25:17] king so the Bible says the woman plotted
[25:20] made a plot to kill naboth and nabo was
[25:26] killed and after after the king had
[25:29] murdered nabo the bible say that God
[25:32] spoke to Elijah and told him go quickly
[25:35] and meet
[25:36] Ahab and tell him you have taken the
[25:40] man's land and even killing him you have
[25:43] killed him you have murdered
[25:45] him and then because of that God
[25:48] declared judgment upon
[25:51] Ahab God told
[25:54] Ahab that you
[25:56] children those who will be died in the
[25:59] city they will be eaten by
[26:02] dogs those who will die in the wildness
[26:05] they will be eaten by the carcasses
[26:08] blessed be the name of the
[26:10] Lord and the Bible says this man went
[26:13] before God he humbled himself he
[26:17] repented and the and God said that are
[26:20] you seeing how my servant Ahab has
[26:23] humbled
[26:24] himself so he sent the prophet to tell
[26:27] him that go tell him
[26:30] that
[26:32] uh whatever is said it will come to
[26:36] pass but
[26:38] after when he's dead blessed be the name
[26:41] of the Lord in other
[26:44] [Music]
[26:45] words God did not take the punishment
[26:49] away but God prolonged it amen and say
[26:54] that those thing will not happen they
[26:57] will happen when you are not
[27:00] there blessed be the name of the Lord
[27:03] that is the same thing that of Israel
[27:05] when Moses stood between them and God
[27:08] God did not change his mind about about
[27:11] his word amen his word settled forever
[27:15] in
[27:17] heaven and because of that God had
[27:20] another method of eliminating them he
[27:23] had to make them move in the wilderness
[27:25] until all of them died blessed be the
[27:27] name of the Lord
[27:29] and the Bible tells us in uh in Joshua
[27:31] chapter 5 that after all that had
[27:35] happened time came because remember
[27:39] these people were not
[27:40] circumcised they were born in the
[27:42] wilderness and the law of God was that
[27:45] all of all of the Jews they are supposed
[27:48] to be circumcised blessed be the name of
[27:51] the Lord and God spoke to Joshua and
[27:53] told him here that it came to pass uh uh
[27:57] at that time God the Lord said unto
[28:00] Joshua make the sharp knives and
[28:02] circumcise again the uh again the
[28:05] children of Israel the second time and
[28:09] Joshua made a sharp knife and knives and
[28:12] circumcised the children of Israel at
[28:15] the hill of the forest skin blessed be
[28:18] the name of the Lord they could not go
[28:20] to the promised land without
[28:23] circumcision and the same thing appli to
[28:25] the church the church will never go the
[28:28] Rapture without the holy spirit amen
[28:32] this one was physical circumcision but
[28:34] the circumcision we are receiving that
[28:36] is the circumcision of the
[28:39] Heart by the knife amen of the Holy
[28:42] Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord
[28:52] [Music]
[28:58] how much more the church today because
[29:00] this was even physical
[29:02] land blessed be the name of the Lord how
[29:05] about the spiritual to the spiritual
[29:08] Israelites praise be to God Amen and
[29:12] this is and and this is the cause why
[29:14] Joshua did circumcise
[29:16] all all the people that came out of
[29:18] Egypt uh that were male even the
[29:22] men of War died in the wildness by the
[29:26] way after they came out of Egypt Egypt
[29:28] now all the people that came out of out
[29:31] were circumcised but the people that
[29:33] were born in the wilderness by the way
[29:36] as they came forth out of Egypt they had
[29:39] not circumcised for the children of
[29:42] Israel walked 40 years in the wildness
[29:44] still the people that were Men of War
[29:47] which came out of Egypt were
[29:50] consumed the men of War had to be
[29:55] consumed amen blessed be the name of the
[30:02] Lord and sometime even Christian are
[30:07] deceived and they think that God is
[30:10] working at their
[30:13] mercies blessed be the name of the Lord
[30:17] we are saved by Amazing Grace unmerited
[30:22] favor we did not deserve
[30:25] amen but God by his sovereign Grace
[30:28] saved us he had mercy on us he had
[30:34] sympathy on us amen that's why that man
[30:37] sang a song and say we owe a Deb we
[30:41] could not
[30:42] pay Jesus Paid the debt he did not
[30:46] owe why because we needed somebody to
[30:50] wash our sins
[30:51] away blessed be the name of the
[30:55] Lord the price which Jesus Paid
[30:58] no rich man would
[31:01] manage no president no King no Pope
[31:07] blessed be the name of the Lord it had
[31:09] to take the blood of God
[31:13] himself so brethren we are at God's
[31:16] mercy but still God did not do
[31:20] everything Jesus said indeed it is
[31:22] finished and that is true but you have
[31:26] got a role to play
[31:30] and when it comes to our part we want to
[31:33] bypass
[31:34] [Applause]
[31:48] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[31:51] praise be to God there is no shortcut
[31:56] Friends new birth is a
[32:00] must there's no way we can dodge it and
[32:03] you will never it's just like
[32:06] death only those who are going to dodge
[32:11] death are those who will be found when
[32:14] they are still
[32:16] alive blessed be the name of the Lord
[32:18] and it's because they died long ago and
[32:22] they are now risen in Christ Jesus
[32:25] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[32:27] amen so Kon when God speaks God means
[32:32] his
[32:35] word and if we can just
[32:39] know or understand I know we know but
[32:43] sometime understanding it that's where
[32:45] the problem comes from because when
[32:48] Jesus told nicodem unless a man is born
[32:51] again he cannot even understand he
[32:54] cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven brother
[32:56] how are we going to see how do you think
[32:59] how are you going to see the kingom of
[33:01] heaven without being born again even the
[33:05] message will not understand it you will
[33:07] not even you will pretend that you're
[33:09] believing
[33:10] it without that we cannot even
[33:14] understand the message
[33:19] amen praise be to
[33:24] God go in and possess the land we have a
[33:28] land to possess and that's the land of
[33:31] the Holy Ghost that is the buer land
[33:34] that is the land of Joy the land of
[33:37] Peace the land of overcoming the land of
[33:40] Victory amen the land of
[33:46] Deliverance blessed be the name of the
[33:54] Lord if you just belong to to
[33:58] denomination if you are Pentecostal
[34:03] grandchild God don't have any
[34:08] grandchildren soon even in the message
[34:10] we're going to have
[34:12] grandchildren for me my grandfather was
[34:14] a message Pastor my father is a deacon
[34:18] or a
[34:20] pastor my brother is an Asher
[34:29] my niece is a
[34:32] musician that does not guarantee
[34:35] you
[34:37] amen you have to arise go
[34:41] possess the
[34:49] land being a message believer is more
[34:52] than just coming to church
[34:57] it is more than reading the
[35:02] message but it's knowing where you are
[35:04] standing it's knowing who you are it's
[35:08] knowing what you stand for amen it's
[35:12] being sure that you have met the
[35:16] requirement it's being sure that the
[35:19] token is applied amen I don't care how
[35:23] much you read about the
[35:25] token how much you sing about it the
[35:28] blood was
[35:31] presented mercy walked
[35:34] in that is not
[35:38] enough coming to church is not enough
[35:41] you must have an experience with
[35:44] God what brings us here is to have more
[35:49] of God in us
[35:58] you need an
[36:02] experience praise be to
[36:05] God something must
[36:09] happen we must have a different
[36:12] testimony moving from flu
[36:15] testimony I was battling with flu but
[36:17] God has said has delivered me
[36:20] no that one is okay but it's not
[36:24] enough even Pentecostal they even have
[36:27] bigger testimonies how about the message
[36:31] Believers we want a message we want a
[36:35] testimony of New
[36:38] Birth brother I've been praying for two
[36:41] months now God F me the Holy Ghost last
[36:45] night amen that is what you want to
[36:52] hear I've been asking God about this but
[36:55] God came down and told me a b c
[36:59] d that is what will make you
[37:05] grounded why do you waste your time
[37:07] coming to
[37:12] church you come and sit you kneel in
[37:16] front of the shair and you
[37:18] sleep when they sing till we me
[37:31] praise be to
[37:32] God
[37:34] Amen
[37:35] [Music]
[37:42] am but that is the
[37:45] truth praise be to
[37:48] God what is going to stabilize us is the
[37:52] holy spirit it is that experience don't
[37:56] think that when you marry that's when
[37:58] you're going to be stable you are
[38:00] deceived you better be stable now you
[38:03] better be serious now you better pray
[38:06] now fast now amen serve God now sing to
[38:10] him now jump to him now
[38:13] amen don't wait until you get married
[38:17] that's another
[38:21] story praise be to God God sent us this
[38:25] message to stabilize
[38:29] us we were moving from Pillar To Post
[38:33] Jehovah Witness to Adventist adven to
[38:36] Islam Islams to bisha bisha
[38:44] to we were just moving
[38:58] but when God sent us the message he told
[39:01] us now the time has come amen when you
[39:05] will no longer go to
[39:08] Mir you not go
[39:11] toine but the true worshipers they are
[39:14] worshiping God in the
[39:17] word and the prophet preached the
[39:19] message God is chosen place of worship
[39:23] amen you are worshiping God in his in
[39:26] his chosen place place and you are
[39:28] dosing in the
[39:30] service

[39:36] be we are not in the mock praise be to

[39:51] stabilized you must have
[40:14] they had seen something
[40:17] unique something worth to die for
[40:20] blessed be the name of the Lord and
[40:22] that's why the prophet say that if
[40:24] you're not ready if you're not worth to
[40:26] die you're not even worth to Le us
[40:33] preaching it is high time we go back and
[40:37] do inventory in our
[40:39] lives and ask
[40:42] yourself am I moving toward the promised
[40:48] land you

[41:18] bell with a long Rob every time here
[41:21] Jing kingling you know the man is still
[41:24] alive jingling kingling
[41:29] the Rob moves as he moves because he was
[41:32] taking the sacrifice of the
[41:34] people and when that man reached there
[41:38] and you hear no sound and no what they
[41:41] just had to pull the
[41:46] rope and the congregation think they
