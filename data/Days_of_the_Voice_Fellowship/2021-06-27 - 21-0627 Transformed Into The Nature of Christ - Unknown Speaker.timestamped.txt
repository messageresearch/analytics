[26:04] lord has been gracious
[26:09] you know as uh you know with the week
[26:12] has been going on
[26:14] wiki tumblr i noticed that uh
[26:17] many messages came through you know this
[26:20] one has died
[26:20] the other one has died
[26:32] it is really disheartening to know that
[26:34] uh they are leaving us
[26:40] you know at the beginning of the
[26:42] actually i think it was the beginning of
[26:43] this week i
[26:44] spoke to brother peter who is a doctor
[26:47] and he told me that they're having very
[26:48] many cases in the hospital there was a
[26:50] container
[27:00] if you do not mind uh one of you have to
[27:03] remind me we'll have you talk to
[27:05] talk to us and tell us what the
[27:07] condition is and maybe to
[27:09] just help the people and uh encourage
[27:12] them to
[27:13] take care whatever they are because you
[27:15] are on the front line and you know
[27:17] whatever is happening there so i'm gonna
[27:18] have
[27:37] yesterday the wife of our brother
[27:40] brother charles omarta just passed away
[27:43] oh proudly
[27:46] your matam challa away against it and uh
[27:50] also in the same week i think a few days
[27:52] ago there's a pastor here i think he's
[27:54] been known by by very many you know uh
[27:57] he passed out with you to cover it
[28:24] but that is not to mean that we our god
[28:27] is dead
[28:27] nature isn't catholic
[28:32] uh he still can heal and deliver people
[28:35] from covey
[28:38] because that's what they say that you
[28:40] would take these sicknesses of the
[28:42] egyptians away from us
[28:47] and uh myself i got the coffee then the
[28:49] lord delivered me
[28:52] so if you get covered or if you have any
[28:55] symptoms and science
[28:56] do not fear to tell us and let us know
[28:58] so that we can be able to
[29:00] pray with you
[29:06] because we believe the lord is still on
[29:07] the throne
[29:10] the
[29:24] different families gathered in their
[29:25] homes
[29:28] we are just the three of us here one two

[30:56] same area
[30:57] and we meet the same people so certainly

[32:05] of the service
[32:10] okay so the others have their videos
[32:12] switched off our videos
[32:16] otherwise uh i was thinking that uh
[32:19] they will uh switch on their videos so
[32:22] we can be able to
[32:23] fellowship and just this would be around
[32:25] the time when we would say greet one
[32:26] another
[32:32] you know i i was just thinking this is
[32:35] technology
[32:36] but then there was internal technology
[32:37] it's always good for us to use it for
[32:39] the glory of god
[32:50] i'm always encouraging you to leave
[32:52] whatever it is that you are doing
[32:53] and sit down and have your phone or your
[32:56] computer whatever it is that you're
[32:58] using to attend the service
[33:06] yes because you know that's the reason
[33:09] why we have
[33:10] uh the online church not for you to be
[33:13] doing whatever it is that you are doing
[33:14] and then
[33:15] you know you just listen you are not a
[33:16] spectator you're not just listening in

[1:27:23] uh translating to uganda
[1:27:27] so we were talking about jesus
[1:27:35] [Applause]
[1:27:43] of displaying himself in a body that he
[1:27:46] built for himself
[1:27:52] amen it reflected
[1:27:55] and the sinful nature of a man could not
[1:27:59] do the thing that he did
[1:28:05] every one of us who was born by our
[1:28:07] mothers
[1:28:10] amen that nature came running after us
[1:28:15] [Applause]

[1:28:39] something is putting on need
[1:28:55] filled child of god but something is
[1:28:57] putting on you
[1:28:58] forcing you to run away from it
[1:29:05] and that thing which is putting on new
[1:29:07] sounds and feels nice
[1:29:19] and it makes you feel satisfied
[1:29:35] and we are all on with it
[1:30:04] the
[1:30:15] because i am son of god
[1:30:27] the sinful nature of man could not do
[1:30:30] could not do the thing that he did
[1:30:34] [Applause]
[1:30:38] so it had to be god making and
[1:30:41] reflecting himself in the mind making a
[1:30:43] mirror

[1:31:00] hallelujah
[1:31:10] [Music]

[1:32:42] and he could not be a savior and and be
[1:32:44] a natural born
[1:32:46] man
[1:32:51] how could he be how could he be a savior
[1:32:54] if he was born by sexual desire
[1:33:01] he could not have been born according to
[1:33:03] the last of the flesh
[1:33:03] [Music]
[1:33:20] word of god yesterday

[1:33:32] that came to restore the lost state
[1:34:31] yahwah and he gave
[1:34:34] gifts to men and one of these gifts
[1:34:40] is the one now god is using to remind
[1:34:42] you of these things
[1:34:57] he had to be more than a man
[1:35:26] it is i found a friend in jesus
[1:35:31] christ he is everything to me
[1:35:34] he is the fairest oh ten thousands to my
[1:35:40] soul

[1:37:14] it was sinless
[1:37:35] [Applause]
[1:38:01] he wasn't wearing that essa would be
[1:38:03] that way
[1:38:07] by
[1:38:15] star can choice choose the nature of god
[1:38:20] because within it quran there is no
[1:38:23] deep to respond to the nature of god

[1:38:38] you shouting on top of my voice

[1:40:44] there and he said he would not
[1:40:45] keep the thing as separate from him
[1:40:53] [Applause]
[1:41:02] god himself i know that abraham will
[1:41:05] send this message down
[1:41:07] down from one to the other generations
[1:41:44] oh
[1:42:07] then he told abraham in the beginning
[1:42:09] that he would save him and save his seed
[1:42:11] after him
[1:42:26] will run away from the pride of life i
[1:42:30] know they will not go in the embers
[1:42:33] run away from those things and because
[1:42:36] god knew that
[1:42:38] he called you he knew
[1:42:54] my brother
[1:43:08] god
[1:43:44] because he knows that your nature is
[1:43:47] with him

[1:45:15] all your siblings look like him but not
[1:45:17] you
[1:45:19] are you really the son of the father
[1:45:21] they say you are
[1:45:22] the god of the word people come to think
[1:45:25] of it
[1:45:27] my father is
[1:46:24] why because the woman is a type of a
[1:46:25] church
[1:46:28] if you want to know your true nature ask
[1:46:31] yourself which message are you hearing
[1:46:33] [Applause]

[1:49:35] beginning that he would save him and
[1:49:38] and save his seed after him and give him
[1:49:40] the unconditional covenant that he
[1:49:42] he made with abraham
[1:49:54] not because abraham was good man
[1:49:57] because god was good i am not
[1:50:01] i i am not here in this message because
[1:50:03] i'm the best
[1:50:06] singer some people when they come to
[1:50:08] this message they expect to find angels
[1:50:13] the only difference between this message
[1:50:15] and their denominations is because
[1:50:19] people in this message are on the right
[1:50:21] track of finding their true nature
[1:50:42] [Music]
[1:50:50] the

[2:01:08] the nature of christ
[2:01:12] you know i can simply say the nature of
[2:01:13] christ is the holy spirit
[2:01:20] but i wouldn't want it to just ease it
[2:01:22] up for you that way

[2:02:39] ghost
[2:02:41] it is the same thing as the nature of
[2:02:43] christ church you know upon their
[2:02:45] christians because the holy spirit
[2:02:49] says it is a person
[2:02:54] it's not something sitting it is a

[2:04:30] they go shopping the nature of those
[2:04:36] churches
[2:04:58] [Applause]
[2:05:31] our god is expecting us to have his
[2:05:33] divine nature
[2:05:36] transform transformation

[2:05:44] nature of christ

[2:17:26] come on
[2:17:41] thank you for the gift of life and that
[2:17:44] we are still
[2:17:45] alive i mean these days accomplishes
[2:17:48] that we are passing through
[2:17:50] father i would like to glorify your name
[2:17:53] and we turn the praise back to you god
[2:17:56] as we are passing through uncertainties
[2:17:59] we appeal to you that you abide with us
[2:18:02] let
[2:18:03] your guidance lead us through until your
[2:18:06] will will be done

[2:18:19] at the end of the day
[2:18:20] the life of christ may be bestowed upon
[2:18:23] us
[2:18:24] in the name of our lord jesus christ we
[2:18:26] pray
[2:18:27] amen
[2:18:31] so i would like to thank our pastor
[2:18:34] chance that he has given me
[2:18:37] [Music]
[2:18:39] blood
[2:18:43] am i clear
[2:18:46] yes we are clear and we can hear you
[2:18:50] yeah this person that
[2:18:53] is uh is around is still
[2:18:57] very uncertain so right now from our
[2:19:01] side the
[2:19:02] medical want the people to do their best
[2:19:05] to
[2:19:06] fulfill all the standard operating
[2:19:08] measures
[2:19:12] we should note them good let the people
[2:19:15] keep
[2:19:16] their masks as much as they can we want
[2:19:20] the people to sanitize and wash their
[2:19:22] hands
[2:19:23] the best that they can we want the
[2:19:26] people to
[2:19:27] try to avoid unnecessary
[2:19:30] meetings because the science is
[2:19:34] true that the disease is transported by
[2:19:37] people
[2:19:38] so we want to uh keep all the sops until
[2:19:43] the wave has passed and we want to
[2:19:47] encourage the people
[2:19:52] to feed well because when your immunity
[2:19:54] is up
[2:19:56] it is easy for you to
[2:20:00] come over this problem and the
[2:20:04] from my side i want to ask the people so
[2:20:07] that
[2:20:08] we trust god because at the end of the
[2:20:11] day
[2:20:12] what is a good physician uh
[2:20:16] those few words i would like to say god
[2:20:19] bless you all
[2:20:20] and shalom brother peter before you go
[2:20:23] i just wanted to ask you uh in your
[2:20:26] hospital are you having convinced
[2:20:28] patients also
[2:20:32] we have had patients but we have
[2:20:34] discharged
[2:20:35] we only left one patient right now of
[2:20:39] course
[2:20:41] otherwise we have been quite a number of
[2:20:43] them
[2:20:44] so it's it's quite serious it's quite on
[2:20:47] the rise now
[2:20:48] yes yes yes so so so much now
[2:20:52] yeah so god bless you for that
[2:20:54] information and thank you also for
[2:20:56] praying for us
[2:20:57] so saints you have had i just pray that
[2:21:01] you keep yourself safe you keep your
[2:21:03] loved ones
[2:21:04] safe you keep your family safe we are
[2:21:07] also doing as much as we can
[2:21:10] to always keep ourselves safe uh
[2:21:13] you know while you pray well let us
[2:21:15] utilize this time
[2:21:17] to do the right things you know let us
[2:21:20] not only because schools are closed
[2:21:21] no one is going to school and you know
[2:21:24] instead of speeding your mind
[2:21:26] with whatever is going going on out
[2:21:28] there take your time
[2:21:30] to prepare yourself for the coming of
[2:21:33] the lord
[2:21:34] i think that's the most noble thing you
[2:21:36] can do at this time
[2:21:38] uh so instead of uh
[2:21:41] you know uh going out with friends and
[2:21:44] we're not even believers and maybe you
[2:21:46] get covered do the bible study
[2:21:48] i'm talking to the young people now do
[2:21:50] the bible study
[2:21:51] get into the message read it take your
[2:21:54] time read it
[2:21:55] and uh we will be very very serious
[2:21:57] whenever we meet we want to find
[2:21:59] what everybody has read and how they
[2:22:01] understand what they read
[2:22:03] and let's see what the holy spirit will
[2:22:06] do
[2:22:07] in us during this time of lockdown i
[2:22:10] just believe that the lord will surely
[2:22:11] move in our hearts
[2:22:13] uh if you want to send in your offering
[2:22:15] your your type
[2:22:16] please use those two numbers they are
[2:22:19] numbers of brother
[2:22:20] joel brother yowery uh he is uh
[2:22:24] our current uh uh
[2:22:27] uh treasurer i think i should call him
[2:22:29] is helping us with a
[2:22:31] with a uh keeping these offerings so
[2:22:34] please send it over to him and do not
[2:22:37] give to the lord as if you were giving
[2:22:39] to man give to the lord
[2:22:41] as you again as if you were given to the
[2:22:43] lord you know
[2:22:44] give generously because it is going to
[2:22:46] be used for a noble cause
[2:22:47] there is nothing that you give to the
[2:22:49] work of god that we are using the wrong
[2:22:51] way we
[2:22:52] use all of it for the sake of the lord
[2:22:54] personally i've never taken anything out
[2:22:55] of it
[2:22:56] whatever you give it is used for the
[2:22:59] work of the lord
[2:23:00] so i believe that god will bless your
[2:23:02] giving as
[2:23:03] as you do as you give those of you who
[2:23:06] are on youtube
[2:23:07] god bless you and thank you for
