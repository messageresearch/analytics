[1:08:34] 6 we are reading from vers one

[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:06] 15 so let me read it in English if you
[1:09:09] are following in your Bible you can just
[1:09:10] follow
[1:09:13] [Music]
[1:09:14] along after these things Jesus went out
[1:09:18] over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea
[1:09:21] of tiberias and a great multitude
[1:09:23] followed him because they saw his
[1:09:25] miracles which he did on them that were
[1:09:27] diseased and Jesus went up into the
[1:09:30] mountain and there sat he sat with his
[1:09:33] disciples and a Passover a feast of the
[1:09:36] Jews was now when Jesus then lifted up
[1:09:39] his eyes and saw a great company come
[1:09:42] unto him he said unto them he said unto
[1:09:45] philli whence shall we buy bread that
[1:09:48] these may eat and he said he said to
[1:09:51] prove to prove him uh for he himself
[1:09:54] knew what he would do Philip answered
[1:09:57] him 200 pen worth of bread is not
[1:10:00] sufficient for them that every one of
[1:10:02] them may take a little one of the of his
[1:10:04] disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother
[1:10:07] said unto him there is a lad here which
[1:10:10] has five b Loaves and two fish small
[1:10:15] fishes but what are they among so many
[1:10:18] and Jesus said make the men sit down now
[1:10:22] there was much grass in the place so the
[1:10:24] men sat down in the number about 5,000
[1:10:28] and Jesus Took the Loaves and when he
[1:10:30] had given thanks he distributed to the
[1:10:32] disciples and the disciples to them that
[1:10:34] were set down and likewise of the fish
[1:10:38] uh the fishes as much as they would when
[1:10:41] they were filled he said unto the
[1:10:43] disciples gather up the fragments that
[1:10:46] remain that nothing be lost therefore
[1:10:48] they gathered them together and filled
[1:10:50] 12 baskets with the fragments of the
[1:10:51] five body loaves which remained over and
[1:10:54] above unto them that had eaten um then
[1:10:58] those men when they had seen the miracle
[1:11:02] that Jesus did said this is of a truth
[1:11:06] that Prophet that should come into the
[1:11:09] world when Jesus therea perceived that
[1:11:12] they would come and take him by force to
[1:11:16] make him a king he departed again into a
[1:11:19] mountain himself alone
[1:11:24] amen am amen you may be
[1:11:33] seated
[1:11:41] Amen Let us also
[1:11:44] read
[1:11:46] uh John chapter 6 verse 63 the same
[1:11:49] chapter
[1:11:54] verse and uh we will read it in luganda
[1:11:57] in
[1:12:01] English from the time from that time
[1:12:05] many of his disciples went back and
[1:12:07] walked no more with
[1:12:16] [Music]
[1:12:22] him then said Jesus unto the 12 will you
[1:12:25] also go
[1:12:30] away then Simon Peter answered him Lord
[1:12:33] to whom shall we go that has the words
[1:12:36] of eternal
[1:12:44] life and we believe and assure that thou
[1:12:47] art that Christ the son of the Living
[1:12:53] God Amen
[1:12:55] amen praise the name of the Lord I'd
[1:12:59] like to speak on the subject to whom
[1:13:00] shall we
[1:13:04] go to whom ask your neighbor to whom
[1:13:07] shall we
[1:13:12] go um I do not expect to be long as
[1:13:17] usual but when he is
[1:13:20] done then I'll be
[1:13:22] done and and he will Grant to us as much
[1:13:26] as we desire this morning according to
[1:13:28] our
[1:13:31] needs so now we we see here friends in
[1:13:34] the portion of scripture that we have
[1:13:36] read we shall read a little more
[1:13:41] later in just a moment we'll continue to
[1:13:43] read from verse
[1:13:46] 47 but we see here that Jesus started
[1:13:48] his ministry with only a few
[1:13:53] disciples and and we I'm sorry I'm just
[1:13:57] going straight into the word this
[1:13:58] morning how many are ready for the
[1:14:01] word we are ready you know sometimes we
[1:14:04] are used to Long preliminaries and
[1:14:06] speeches and talks but this morning I
[1:14:08] feel I have a lot on my heart to share
[1:14:09] with you and so I just want to go
[1:14:15] straight the rest shall come
[1:14:18] afterwards we should be ready to say
[1:14:19] Amen right
[1:14:21] away amen I'm happy to see different
[1:14:24] ones of you
[1:14:25] course and I love all of you amen but we
[1:14:29] love him more than
[1:14:32] anything so Jesus started his
[1:14:34] ministry with only a few
[1:14:37] disciples and his ministry and influence
[1:14:42] grew and it began to attract many other
[1:14:45] people and they began to join
[1:14:48] him because I remember when he was
[1:14:50] baptized on the on the River Jordan by
[1:14:53] uh by uh John
[1:14:57] he was only alone but after that water
[1:15:00] baptism he began to walk and his
[1:15:03] ministry you know he called 12
[1:15:08] disciples he only called 12 and even
[1:15:11] among the ones that he directly
[1:15:14] called not everyone was a genuine
[1:15:17] believer you know he actually said that
[1:15:19] didn't called 12 of you and one of you
[1:15:21] was a devil
[1:15:25] and so because Judas did not
[1:15:27] believe but he was called so now you see
[1:15:31] the 12
[1:15:32] disciples but you see Judas was also
[1:15:35] called for a
[1:15:37] purpose and that's why I say that
[1:15:39] whenever a child of God is called by
[1:15:43] God you are called for a
[1:15:46] purpose but I want to be called for a
[1:15:48] good
[1:15:49] purpose I want to be a v of horor in the
[1:15:52] presence of God
[1:15:55] amen as he says in the word you know in
[1:15:56] the house there are many
[1:15:59] vessels there vess of horon and vessel
[1:16:01] of
[1:16:03] Dison and you see but you see in all
[1:16:06] they his
[1:16:07] vessels you know you can say that
[1:16:09] Pharaoh was his
[1:16:12] vessel you know you can say that Judas
[1:16:14] was his
[1:16:15] vessel you know you can say Cain was his
[1:16:18] vessel you can say all these were God is
[1:16:22] vessel but you see in a way it comes to
[1:16:24] to a point whereby we cannot explain
[1:16:27] some
[1:16:29] things because I tell you what there are
[1:16:31] certain things that we canot be able to
[1:16:33] explain as human
[1:16:37] beings and I believe there is no one
[1:16:39] single human being can say that he's
[1:16:41] know it
[1:16:44] all even our Prophet by the BR he never
[1:16:48] knew all
[1:16:49] things I'm sorry to disappoint you if
[1:16:51] you thought he
[1:16:52] did in some things he actually said I
[1:16:55] don't
[1:16:57] know and so you see things that are
[1:17:00] revealed are for us and our children and
[1:17:03] things that are not revealed they are
[1:17:06] forgot and so for as much as he chooses
[1:17:09] to reveal to
[1:17:11] us that we
[1:17:13] receive that we accept and that we make
[1:17:16] part of our life and what it doesn't
[1:17:19] choose to reveal to us if he says it we
[1:17:23] believe it
[1:17:25] and that settles it whether we
[1:17:27] understand it or not how many understand
[1:17:30] that and so we see there have many vels
[1:17:33] in his
[1:17:34] house and so vels of honor and vs Of
[1:17:39] Dishonor and even Judas was a
[1:17:42] vessel and even you are a
[1:17:45] vessel but what kind of vessel are you
[1:17:47] in his
[1:17:49] house I want to be a vessel of
[1:17:52] horor I want to be used for the POS
[1:17:56] I want to be used to influence others
[1:18:03] POS and his ministry and influence of
[1:18:06] Jesus's Ministry
[1:18:09] rather it grew with
[1:18:12] time after he called the
[1:18:14] 12 this is all he called and then he
[1:18:18] began to move from place to place with
[1:18:21] them and his ministry began to be um you
[1:18:25] know began to fulfill his his
[1:18:28] purpose he began to raise the dead he
[1:18:31] began to Open the Eyes of the blind he
[1:18:34] began to set free the captives he began
[1:18:36] to move in the lives of people and lives
[1:18:40] of people were changed because of his
[1:18:43] ministry but we see after a
[1:18:46] while his ministry now began to pull
[1:18:53] multitudes as we saw in verse two he
[1:18:55] says a great multitude followed
[1:19:00] him he was going in a
[1:19:03] mountain he was going to sit with his
[1:19:06] disciples and maybe teach them but along
[1:19:09] the way a crowd a multitude followed
[1:19:14] him he never called them he never begged
[1:19:17] them but they followed him because they
[1:19:20] needed him the reason for a good
[1:19:23] following
[1:19:25] was what that's the
[1:19:27] question today we have many people
[1:19:29] following Jesus in the
[1:19:32] world today we have many forms of
[1:19:36] Christianity today we have many
[1:19:38] preachers who are preaching
[1:19:41] Christianity but the question is why are
[1:19:44] they following
[1:19:46] Jesus why are you following
[1:19:50] Jesus ask your neighbor why are you
[1:19:52] following Jesus
[1:19:54] why are you ask them now brother why are
[1:19:57] you following
[1:19:58] Jesus do you know why ask yourself why
[1:20:01] am I following
[1:20:03] Jesus and until you know why you're
[1:20:05] following
[1:20:07] him you will not know what kind of
[1:20:09] vessel you
[1:20:14] are so when he went to a
[1:20:17] mountain these people came following him
[1:20:21] but why were they following him they
[1:20:23] were not following him because amen of
[1:20:25] what of the reason why he came in the
[1:20:28] world where you may say the reason why
[1:20:31] Jesus came in the
[1:20:32] world was to heal the sick was to heal
[1:20:35] the lamb was to Open the Eyes of the
[1:20:37] blind was to perform Miracles but I'll
[1:20:41] tell you he came for more than
[1:20:44] that he came for more than
[1:20:47] that Jesus came to bring
[1:20:51] life Jesus was the bread of life
[1:20:55] and he came down from heaven to come and
[1:20:58] die for our sins he came to bring
[1:21:02] Salvation he was the word that brings
[1:21:05] life down the Earth but when many
[1:21:08] followed him in that first poool of his
[1:21:12] ministry they were not interested in the
[1:21:15] word they were interested in the
[1:21:19] Miracles and today you see all the mega
[1:21:22] churches they call it
[1:21:26] look at all the mega
[1:21:28] CH why are they
[1:21:31] following it is because there is a man
[1:21:34] who is supposedly doing
[1:21:38] Miracles they have promised them come
[1:21:40] and see your
[1:21:42] Miracle come receive your Miracle the
[1:21:45] man of God will anoint you and you will
[1:21:47] receive your mirac so now it's it's a
[1:21:50] following after
[1:21:53] Miracles all right right now when he
[1:21:55] went into the
[1:21:57] mountain still a great company followed
[1:22:00] him he still knew what they
[1:22:03] needed they needed
[1:22:06] food and as long as Jesus distributed to
[1:22:09] their
[1:22:11] needs they received
[1:22:13] him now this is this is quite ironical
[1:22:18] because when they received him they
[1:22:21] received him as somebody who gave them
[1:22:23] food
[1:22:25] but by receiving him as someone who gave
[1:22:27] them
[1:22:28] food they accepted him as a
[1:22:32] prophet and they accepted him as a
[1:22:35] king I want you to look at this take a
[1:22:38] moment to
[1:22:40] Think
[1:22:41] Jesus had not
[1:22:44] yet told them why he
[1:22:47] came he had not even revealed himself to
[1:22:50] them
[1:22:53] well but they because they saw food you
[1:22:58] know when Jesus was on the mountain with
[1:22:59] the
[1:23:00] disciples and he saw the
[1:23:03] mud he turned to Philip he said Philip
[1:23:08] Brother Martin where's
[1:23:10] brother says
[1:23:12] brother sister Rose sister Grace see the
[1:23:16] people are
[1:23:18] coming you see the great
[1:23:20] multitude what shall we feed them
[1:23:24] this is Jesus the
[1:23:27] Messiah the one who came to die for the
[1:23:30] S but he asked
[1:23:33] Philip the question is did he know what
[1:23:36] to
[1:23:37] do the Bible says he knew what he was
[1:23:40] supposed to
[1:23:42] do but when he saw them
[1:23:44] coming he
[1:23:46] knew these ones are not coming for the
[1:23:51] word these ones are coming for food
[1:23:55] my prayer every day is that Lord Lord
[1:23:59] Des my
[1:24:01] heart inward parts of my
[1:24:04] heart you know many people when when
[1:24:07] they come to
[1:24:08] God they don't receive him for who he
[1:24:10] truly
[1:24:12] is but they receive him for what he
[1:24:15] has and he
[1:24:17] knows
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:21] and and when they came he knew that
[1:24:25] right away these ones want
[1:24:28] food he said tell me Philip what shall
[1:24:31] we feed
[1:24:34] them we don't have food in the car what
[1:24:38] shall we feed them and pH said you know
[1:24:42] Master oh to feed all these people we
[1:24:45] will need so much
[1:24:47] money we will need so much money let me
[1:24:51] tell you there are many people who have
[1:24:53] thought it is money that runs a
[1:24:57] Ministry now let me address this for
[1:24:59] just a
[1:25:01] moment money runs the food
[1:25:06] Ministry but money does not run the word
[1:25:11] ministry whenever you feel when there is
[1:25:14] no money you have no Ministry you have
[1:25:17] nothing to do for to serve the
[1:25:19] Lord it means you were not called to the
[1:25:23] word ministry
[1:25:26] but is a food
[1:25:28] Ministry with the food Ministry you need
[1:25:32] money but with a word you only need to
[1:25:36] speak as God gives you
[1:25:38] utterance and here he said what shall we
[1:25:42] fit we need money Philip said we need so
[1:25:45] much
[1:25:46] money but Jesus told him and and then
[1:25:49] someone else came and said but there's
[1:25:52] this little child some fish and
[1:25:55] bread and then Jesus you know as the
[1:25:58] people came came to approach him Jesus
[1:26:01] told the people brother Alan he said
[1:26:05] tell all of them to
[1:26:07] sit so they sat
[1:26:10] down why do you think they sat
[1:26:13] down they did not sit down to hear the
[1:26:16] word they sat down to see what does he
[1:26:20] have to offer
[1:26:25] and they sat
[1:26:26] down and Jesus looked at them he got the
[1:26:30] small fish
[1:26:31] and and he prayed over it and after he
[1:26:34] prayed over it he said serve
[1:26:37] them as they were sitting down I'm sure
[1:26:41] they had great
[1:26:43] expectations something is
[1:26:45] about something is in
[1:26:48] store that's what the Christian Church
[1:26:50] usually
[1:26:52] expects what is your expect
[1:26:56] when you came to the message of the
[1:26:58] hour what is your
[1:27:00] expectation when you accepted to be
[1:27:04] baptized if your expectation is
[1:27:07] wrong if it doesn't match God is
[1:27:12] word then you know it is wrong and when
[1:27:15] it is wrong you can never fully attain
[1:27:19] what God has in store for you
[1:27:24] time comes when you need to sit down and
[1:27:28] make an inventory of your
[1:27:30] life why am I here what am I
[1:27:34] doing why am I in this church why am I
[1:27:37] following Jesus why am I even singing
[1:27:41] why am I doing what I'm
[1:27:42] doing what is the my
[1:27:45] expectation what is the desire of my
[1:27:48] heart what do I want from
[1:27:50] God these people's hearts
[1:27:54] not after him they were after what he
[1:27:57] could
[1:27:58] do and Jesus knew it and Jesus will give
[1:28:03] you what you
[1:28:04] want if you want money he will give you
[1:28:07] money and that's all so you see we have
[1:28:10] people today who have
[1:28:13] specialized in receiving many things
[1:28:15] from
[1:28:17] Jesus specialized in receiving money
[1:28:21] specialized in receiving uh you know
[1:28:24] gifts and miracles wonders but I'll tell
[1:28:27] you what this can be typed by the
[1:28:30] scripture in the
[1:28:35] Bible where it talks about the girls who
[1:28:39] are
[1:28:40] coming today I'm dealing with something
[1:28:42] a little bit deep and I want you to
[1:28:43] follow me
[1:28:46] closely all right give me your
[1:28:48] attention and so as these girls came
[1:28:52] King anerus was seated and waiting
[1:28:56] to find one who would be a true
[1:28:59] Queen and one by one
[1:29:02] came and you know you not she would not
[1:29:04] please the king and she would go away
[1:29:08] and another one would come and another
[1:29:10] one would come but hear
[1:29:12] this whenever a
[1:29:15] woman came before the presence of the
[1:29:19] king she was taken from the house of the
[1:29:22] women but she was never taken back in
[1:29:25] that
[1:29:27] house she would not be taken into the
[1:29:29] house of the
[1:29:33] cont follow closely now and this woman
[1:29:36] would go in the house of the
[1:29:39] cont will
[1:29:41] never ever come before the presence of
[1:29:44] the king
[1:29:48] Uninvited but there is one thing that
[1:29:53] these women that were in the house of
[1:29:54] the
[1:29:57] country they they
[1:30:00] enjoyed
[1:30:02] gifts they were spoiled all the
[1:30:05] time by good things from the from the
[1:30:08] presence of the
[1:30:09] king the king gave them whatever they
[1:30:13] needed you want jewelry yes
[1:30:17] je you want clo get CL what do you want
[1:30:20] whatever you need they were given
[1:30:24] whatever they
[1:30:25] wanted but they were never to come
[1:30:29] before the presence of the
[1:30:31] king because they never pleased the
[1:30:36] king but let me tell you there is only
[1:30:39] one
[1:30:41] woman that was supposed to please the
[1:30:44] king and that one woman would not be
[1:30:47] made
[1:30:49] a but she would also not go back into
[1:30:51] the house of the women
[1:30:54] but I tell you where she would go she
[1:30:57] would go in the inner
[1:30:59] place she would go in the secret
[1:31:02] chamber called the place of the
[1:31:06] queen this was
[1:31:08] Queen the queen of the whole
[1:31:11] Kingdom I will tell you a little more
[1:31:13] about her this one received everything
[1:31:17] The Other Women received if she
[1:31:22] wanted but even more
[1:31:25] she received amen whatever the king
[1:31:29] had
[1:31:31] as she would be made queen with the
[1:31:34] King she would receive the name of the
[1:31:38] king amen she would you know also come
[1:31:41] in the presence of the
[1:31:43] king you remember no one was allowed to
[1:31:46] come before the presence of the
[1:31:49] king but Esther was that
[1:31:51] woman when es was
[1:31:55] accepted she fasted and prayed If my
[1:31:58] people that are called by my name shall
[1:32:01] humble themselves and pray hear amen is
[1:32:05] the king and Esther amen the bride the
[1:32:09] wife of the king she fasted and she
[1:32:13] prayed for three days and nights and
[1:32:16] then walked before the presence of the
[1:32:19] king now the king did not deny her
[1:32:24] there's a song that says I would not be
[1:32:27] denied I would not be
[1:32:30] denied if
[1:32:32] Jesus came and made me whole I would not
[1:32:37] be because Esther was made whole by the
[1:32:41] king so when she came everybody was
[1:32:44] shocked she's going to be king she's
[1:32:47] going to be how could she walk and
[1:32:50] interrup the
[1:32:51] coun and interrupt the king
[1:32:55] everybody looked but as they
[1:32:58] looked she continued com she continued
[1:33:02] work and came right before the king and
[1:33:05] the King had his golden
[1:33:09] SE when he would put it
[1:33:11] up it would mean
[1:33:13] Mery you were received then you would
[1:33:17] touch it of I
[1:33:20] receive I receive your
[1:33:22] presence accept your presence I accept
[1:33:27] your acceptance of
[1:33:31] me and as she walked before the king the
[1:33:35] king you know looked at her
[1:33:39] angry but his anger was
[1:33:42] [Music]
[1:33:44] pass by something no one else could
[1:33:49] explain the king and the
[1:33:51] queen were connected
[1:33:55] the desire of the
[1:33:57] queen was not after
[1:34:00] anything when she was
[1:34:02] asked what else do you need before you
[1:34:05] go to the king the first
[1:34:09] time she said
[1:34:11] nothing nothing the only thing I want I
[1:34:15] want to see the
[1:34:17] king and this Esther walked before king
[1:34:22] and the King raised his golden
[1:34:24] and
[1:34:26] tached as a sign of
[1:34:28] accept your acceptance of me and at that
[1:34:32] moment everybody knew the queen was a
[1:34:36] special lady before the
[1:34:39] king the queen was
[1:34:41] accepted amen because our
[1:34:44] desire was after the
[1:34:46] king what the King has she was like in
[1:34:50] her heart I don't want to stay in my
[1:34:52] chamber
[1:34:54] with all the gifts from the king with
[1:34:56] every good thing from the king with all
[1:34:59] the money with all the cloes with all
[1:35:01] the good with all the gifts and miracles
[1:35:04] I want to go before The King and I want
[1:35:07] to have The King and I want to
[1:35:10] experience that presence of him and I
[1:35:14] being
[1:35:15] one let me tell you we have different
[1:35:19] groups of
[1:35:20] people in the economy of God
[1:35:26] there are some
[1:35:28] groups which will never be
[1:35:32] raptured they never
[1:35:34] going and I'm talking about
[1:35:40] Christians they are within the
[1:35:42] kingdom they have been accepted but
[1:35:48] rejected they're in another
[1:35:52] chamber they
[1:35:55] they can receive all the gifts and all
[1:35:57] the Miracles and all the good things but
[1:36:00] they dare
[1:36:01] not come before the
[1:36:03] presence of the king those who are going
[1:36:07] to go in the Rapture will be those who
[1:36:09] will come in the presence of the
[1:36:13] K but there are many people who have
[1:36:16] received Grace who have accepted the
[1:36:19] word the word when I say the word not in
[1:36:22] its entir
[1:36:25] they have received portions here
[1:36:26] portions
[1:36:27] there and they have rejected other
[1:36:30] portions and because of that they do not
[1:36:34] qualify to come up in the Rapture
[1:36:37] because you can only come up in the
[1:36:38] Rapture on one basis you can only come
[1:36:42] in the Rapture on the basis of his
[1:36:45] Holiness on the basis of his
[1:36:48] Perfection and that comes only by one
[1:36:51] thing listen comes by the
[1:36:55] word because the blood is the
[1:36:58] word life is in the
[1:37:00] blood amen the blood is the
[1:37:03] word my life is the word he says my word
[1:37:07] is
[1:37:09] life but there will be some who will
[1:37:12] accept him who will receive him but not
[1:37:16] in the entirety of his
[1:37:18] word because of that they are not
[1:37:22] perfected but word perfects us we are
[1:37:25] perfected by the word of God which lives
[1:37:29] and abides
[1:37:30] forever that's why the Rapture is for
[1:37:34] those who have received that
[1:37:36] Perfection is
[1:37:38] perfection and they will be the one the
[1:37:40] B calls them without
[1:37:42] sport without
[1:37:44] wrinkle that does not
[1:37:46] mean that they would have lived
[1:37:50] spotless but that means because they
[1:37:53] accept
[1:37:54] the
[1:37:55] word because they bow to the they their
[1:37:59] alance to the they received the word in
[1:38:02] every
[1:38:04] situation and they strived to make their
[1:38:07] calling and election
[1:38:09] sure and they worked out their salvation
[1:38:12] with fear and trembling and they because
[1:38:15] God
[1:38:15] cared they to care to know what does God
[1:38:19] want me to do what does the word expect
[1:38:22] of me
[1:38:24] what is God's expectation of and because
[1:38:27] they did that God gave them his
[1:38:32] perfe their
[1:38:35] imperfections were made
[1:38:38] perfect through the
[1:38:40] world but there will be
[1:38:42] others which I don't care God is
[1:38:46] gracious God is merciful and because of
[1:38:50] that I do whatever I want to do in my
[1:38:53] way I live in my life I am not bed and
[1:38:58] I'm still
[1:38:59] saved well I'm sorry to
[1:39:03] say but none of those can ever be part
[1:39:06] of the
[1:39:09] Rapture
[1:39:10] cared knew what she
[1:39:13] wanted had the better reason why she
[1:39:16] came we find out
[1:39:19] here in the scripture which we
[1:39:21] read these people here
[1:39:24] when they came they were among those who
[1:39:26] came for
[1:39:29] food and as Jesus distributed to their
[1:39:32] needs they said oh this is a
[1:39:35] prophet he's a prophet he's a mighty
[1:39:40] prophet and actually the Bible now says
[1:39:43] down there that when
[1:39:46] Jesus
[1:39:48] perceived that they would come and take
[1:39:50] him by
[1:39:54] to make
[1:39:56] him he
[1:39:58] departed and he ran away
[1:40:01] from these people love Jesus so
[1:40:04] much Jesus I love you too much too
[1:40:09] much how do you love him why do you love
[1:40:13] him you know you gave me a lot of food
[1:40:16] you know you're Mir work you know you do
[1:40:18] so many good things you do wonderful
[1:40:20] things and because of that I love you
[1:40:23] you must be my king so listen this is
[1:40:27] the Christian church
[1:40:29] today they have accepted
[1:40:32] Jesus as a king as long
[1:40:37] as he is giving them what they
[1:40:41] need the Bible says in the end
[1:40:44] time we shall have seven
[1:40:47] women what's the name of this brother
[1:40:49] over
[1:40:51] here brother come up
[1:40:54] can you come up
[1:40:56] here I pray that
[1:40:59] yeah I War you Brothers don't doze in
[1:41:04] church there was a brother who was
[1:41:06] dozing in
[1:41:07] church and he was
[1:41:10] seated and uh the pastor was preaching
[1:41:12] about
[1:41:16] um about the Chariot of Fire coming
[1:41:20] down you know about that brother the of
[1:41:22] Fire
[1:41:25] yes and and it says The Chariot is
[1:41:27] coming down the is coming down and as
[1:41:31] the Char was coming down you know
[1:41:33] elishah said oh Master you know give me
[1:41:37] dou portion of your power and he gave
[1:41:40] portion of his power and the brother was
[1:41:42] Seated on the on the
[1:41:44] chair and there was a carpet like this
[1:41:47] and he had removed his shoes so his
[1:41:50] shoes were on the side so when the when
[1:41:52] the when the pastor was preaching the
[1:41:55] brother was experiencing
[1:41:57] everything in the
[1:42:00] vision and he was seeing himself going
[1:42:03] in the
[1:42:04] Chariot and and when he said and then
[1:42:07] Elijah went and then he woke up he stood
[1:42:11] up he realized his shoes were
[1:42:13] not and he says Ah El's gone with my
[1:42:22] shoes and the brother told him brother
[1:42:25] youres are
[1:42:30] here I was not using as an
[1:42:33] example I called you to make another
[1:42:35] example the Bible says in the end
[1:42:38] time there shall be one
[1:42:40] man brother you
[1:42:42] married all

[1:43:15] have we don't want nothing we just want
[1:43:18] your
[1:43:21] name and we see that that's the
[1:43:24] generation we
[1:43:26] living that's the generation we living
[1:43:29] in physically speaking but Also
[1:43:33] spiritually we have because women a
[1:43:36] woman is a type of a
[1:43:38] church and we have women today churches
[1:43:42] today Christians today who say Lord
[1:43:46] accept us as Christians we are
[1:43:50] Christians but don't tell us things in
[1:43:53] the
[1:43:54] Bible we don't want to do them they very
[1:43:58] difficult they very hard let us leave
[1:44:01] our
[1:44:02] life but accept us as your own as your
[1:44:06] wife but let me tell you in the mid of
[1:44:09] all that
[1:44:11] chaos God has a
[1:44:14] wife God has a
[1:44:16] church a spotless church and that church
[1:44:20] is coming into view
[1:44:23] the Rapture must
[1:44:24] happen and there must be a
[1:44:27] witness praise the name of the Lord and
[1:44:30] we find that these people they had come
[1:44:34] only to make him as
[1:44:36] king but not to obey his
[1:44:39] Commandments but King because they
[1:44:42] wanted attachment to
[1:44:44] him so they can have what they
[1:44:48] receive from him today we have the same
[1:44:51] Spirit people go to churches because
[1:44:54] they're looking for
[1:44:56] blessings you know on a Sunday they they
[1:44:59] ask themselves where can we
[1:45:01] go where shall we find who is Anointed
[1:45:04] more we hear that that church let us go
[1:45:08] for some
[1:45:09] blessing and another Sunday they will
[1:45:11] find another
[1:45:12] one they spiritual
[1:45:16] prostitutes may God help us to stay put
[1:45:20] that thing is also coming in the message
[1:45:24] you find people are floting from P to
[1:45:27] post they can never rest under one
[1:45:31] Ministry to be to grow when they go
[1:45:34] under a Ministry it's not because they
[1:45:37] are willing to submit
[1:45:39] themselves it is because there's
[1:45:41] something they want from
[1:45:42] them you find younger men going to
[1:45:45] churches to Ser for a while but really
[1:45:48] their
[1:45:49] intention is to find a sister there
[1:45:55] young people you are quiet as if you
[1:45:57] don't
[1:45:59] know that's
[1:46:01] true you will see Brothers saying I from
[1:46:05] today I'm now a member
[1:46:08] here but the
[1:46:10] intention is because there is a GU have
[1:46:13] seen in that
[1:46:15] church and after they
[1:46:18] snatch then you'll never find them
[1:46:21] again what was their
[1:46:23] intention you find others coming because
[1:46:27] they hard there are more blessings
[1:46:29] flowing there oh because they had when
[1:46:33] you go there you'll find
[1:46:34] Opportunities because and so they will
[1:46:36] be here and when they don't see what
[1:46:38] they find they go here and they find
[1:46:41] what they want and then they go there
[1:46:43] let me tell you we have a generation now
[1:46:46] that is very very
[1:46:49] dangerous we in our time which is not
[1:46:52] many
[1:46:54] we used to sit under one
[1:46:57] ministry as long as we are convinced and
[1:47:00] sure that I believe him to be a man of
[1:47:03] God and I believe this church is going
[1:47:05] to help me in my spiritual walk with the
[1:47:09] Lord and a person will stay
[1:47:12] put and learn and ask questions and ask
[1:47:17] to meet the
[1:47:19] pastor for Spiritual concerns
[1:47:23] Pastor I want you to pray for me Pastor
[1:47:26] I'm going through this
[1:47:27] hardship I had a dream and it is
[1:47:29] troubling
[1:47:31] me what can I do about this what does
[1:47:34] the Bible say about
[1:47:36] this I was sharing with someone I was
[1:47:40] challenged can you help me that's what
[1:47:43] we used to be
[1:47:45] like but what is this generation going
[1:47:48] to you know they only come to the pastor
[1:47:51] when they want money
[1:47:55] you never see them other
[1:47:57] time when someone when when you know
[1:48:00] brother it's
[1:48:03] coming I want to meet you you know how
[1:48:06] they want
[1:48:09] money they will never ask for prayer
[1:48:13] they will never ask for councel they
[1:48:15] will never ask for help spiritual help
[1:48:19] they are not concerned about growing
[1:48:20] spiritually
[1:48:23] what is their motive what is their
[1:48:25] intention their motive and intentions
[1:48:28] are completely worldly
[1:48:31] things they are not different from these
[1:48:34] same people that came to
[1:48:36] Jesus they did not come to him because
[1:48:39] he was the Messiah they came to him
[1:48:42] because they he can do some
[1:48:46] magic and food will come Miracles will
[1:48:50] come money will come let us go
[1:48:54] to and these kind of people how do you
[1:48:57] know
[1:48:58] them something
[1:49:00] small they get offended and they walk
[1:49:04] away as long as you bring the word and
[1:49:08] it pierces them they feel they no longer
[1:49:11] have
[1:49:13] interest they never walk away with a
[1:49:16] good
[1:49:18] testimony they walk away with a negative
[1:49:21] t
[1:49:23] why because their first initial
[1:49:27] motive was
[1:49:30] wrong may God raise another
[1:49:33] generation of young people Whose desire
[1:49:37] is after the
[1:49:39] word Whose desire after the things of
[1:49:45] the praise
[1:49:47] God praise
[1:49:50] God now these things
[1:49:53] I am teaching you because these are very
[1:49:56] important and this is not the kind of
[1:49:59] sermon that you say Amen to all the
[1:50:02] time but I will preach it
[1:50:06] anyhow because there an inspiration that
[1:50:08] I
[1:50:09] receive and I'm going to preach it
[1:50:10] whether you are saying amen or whether
[1:50:12] you're not saying
[1:50:14] amen you know it used to be in in in in
[1:50:18] the early
[1:50:19] years when a message preacher
[1:50:23] three things people can't say
[1:50:26] Amen
[1:50:28] p and when he preaches the word they get
[1:50:31] excited amen but now it is becoming the
[1:50:35] opp let us not
[1:50:38] back let us go back to the
[1:50:41] original let us go
[1:50:44] back to the word of God these people
[1:50:47] would almost worship their
[1:50:51] pastors because of physical benefits
[1:50:53] from
[1:50:55] them praise God praise
[1:50:59] God I've seen and I'm seen a lot of
[1:51:04] this in my many years of ministry it's
[1:51:07] now more than a
[1:51:09] decade and this woman that
[1:51:12] came and you know
[1:51:15] uh you know in ethopia
[1:51:18] then and you know she she had many needs
[1:51:22] well of course we are foreigners usually
[1:51:24] I don't know why people think that
[1:51:25] foreigners when they living in a country
[1:51:26] they have more money
[1:51:30] than so you know she came the first
[1:51:34] Sunday said that you know she she was
[1:51:37] touched and she wanted to be more of the
[1:51:40] word and you know she's never had things
[1:51:42] like this before
[1:51:43] and and you know let me tell you when
[1:51:45] you when pastors hear those
[1:51:48] things they feel automatically attached
[1:51:50] to that person
[1:51:54] and they want to help
[1:51:56] them and when they
[1:51:59] did when when she did were automatically
[1:52:02] attached myself and my wife was like
[1:52:06] this is real deal she really interested
[1:52:08] in the
[1:52:09] word and the Second Sunday she came with
[1:52:13] a
[1:52:14] proposal past I have this business
[1:52:18] to I had seen already enough of that
[1:52:23] discouraged I told her sister just keep
[1:52:25] coming to
[1:52:26] church all your needs God Will
[1:52:30] Supply she said amen she never came
[1:52:34] back she never came back and have many
[1:52:37] more
[1:52:38] examples over
[1:52:41] time and it comes you see most of these
[1:52:45] churches where pastors are
[1:52:48] worship I don't care whether it is in
[1:52:50] the message or out of the message
[1:52:53] I'm telling you
[1:52:55] reality to the extent that these people
[1:52:57] will all literally worship their man of
[1:53:01] God some of them will even bow oh Pastor
[1:53:05] I don't know what I've
[1:53:06] done you think they they are doing that
[1:53:09] because the man of God has impacted
[1:53:11] their spiritual
[1:53:14] life it is because the man of God has
[1:53:16] invested too much
[1:53:21] money let me tell you God did not call
[1:53:25] me to invest money in
[1:53:28] anyone no I would be a preacher of
[1:53:33] food the anointing upon me is there not
[1:53:37] the anointing to distribute
[1:53:38] food the anointing upon me amen is the
[1:53:42] anointing to give the word of
[1:53:45] God every true preacher was not called
[1:53:49] to be a
[1:53:50] distributor of Earthly riches and other
[1:53:53] things that only comes in to
[1:53:57] support it always comes in to support
[1:54:01] there is no one
[1:54:03] person God has ever called and did not
[1:54:11] equip he equips you with whatever are
[1:54:15] three things you
[1:54:17] need but I believe when you come into
[1:54:19] the
[1:54:20] ministry or under
[1:54:23] Min you come to do
[1:54:27] what that I believe everyone should have
[1:54:30] a church
[1:54:33] home you cannot be
[1:54:35] floting you have to have a church home a
[1:54:39] place where you call your
[1:54:42] church but you still fellowship with
[1:54:45] others but when you call this your
[1:54:48] church he says for what where you will
[1:54:51] attend
[1:54:54] regularly Whenever there is a meeting it
[1:54:56] is your
[1:54:58] duty to
[1:55:00] attend I I'm not interested in your
[1:55:05] money if you don't attend
[1:55:09] Services over time I've had
[1:55:12] people who would who I know can attend
[1:55:15] services and they don't attend but they
[1:55:19] they regular payers
[1:55:23] sometimes I've had to send it
[1:55:26] back yes because we are not here to to
[1:55:30] be Tax
[1:55:32] Collectors it's not your money that I'm
[1:55:34] interested
[1:55:35] in it is your
[1:55:38] soul you have to be ready to surrender
[1:55:41] to the Lord because you may give your
[1:55:44] money but if I take your money and you
[1:55:47] do not put your soul on the line of the
[1:55:49] word of God
[1:55:52] I am a thief and
[1:55:56] a you see these are things that are
[1:55:59] difficult to
[1:56:00] say but things that are very very
[1:56:03] healthy for
[1:56:04] us from time to time to remind ourselves
[1:56:07] of these
[1:56:08] things I believe you know where a place
[1:56:12] where you go and and support the
[1:56:15] ca where you attend regularly and you
[1:56:19] support the C so in other words we are
[1:56:21] members of
[1:56:22] church because we are supporting the
[1:56:25] church we are supporting with our
[1:56:28] presence and we are supporting with our
[1:56:30] money and we are supporting whenever
[1:56:32] need
[1:56:34] is when we say there is this need come
[1:56:37] up and support but these days oh it is
[1:56:40] the
[1:56:42] opposite young people want to be
[1:56:45] supported but they never support the
[1:56:47] work of God why we don't have you don't
[1:56:51] have because you don't
[1:56:54] give you see if you give you shall
[1:56:58] receive I remember when we believe
[1:57:00] brother Mar you remember
[1:57:01] that we had too little but we would give
[1:57:06] whatever we had we were
[1:57:08] students but out of what we
[1:57:10] have we would give we would give too
[1:57:16] little I now remember there was a time I
[1:57:19] used to give coins in the church
[1:57:24] that was
[1:57:26] brutal I now remember that I used to
[1:57:30] give
[1:57:31] coin so don't fear to give a
[1:57:34] coin if that's all you
[1:57:36] have you're doing your your
[1:57:40] responsibility and then it's the
[1:57:41] pastor's Minister's
[1:57:44] responsibility to turn to your spiritual
[1:57:50] needs praise the name of the
[1:57:53] Lord so now these people came
[1:57:55] down and they sat down and they said
[1:57:59] pastor Jesus you are now our
[1:58:01] pastor he said oh am I oh yeah you are
[1:58:05] now as a matter of fact you are no
[1:58:08] longer only our Prophet we want to make
[1:58:11] you King
[1:58:13] us when he perceived it
[1:58:19] he he did not accept
[1:58:29] and later on tables
[1:58:33] turned after he fed them
[1:58:36] the after he gave them the
[1:58:39] Miracles then now he
[1:58:41] started on his real
[1:58:44] purpose why he had a
[1:58:46] calling to them vers 47 I promise we
[1:58:49] would read that shortly so
[1:58:52] if you can turn there with me
[1:58:59] please verily verily I say unto you he
[1:59:02] that believeth on me has everlasting
[1:59:07] life I am the bread of
[1:59:10] life your fathers did eat Mana in the
[1:59:15] wilderness and are dead this is the
[1:59:18] bread which cometh forth from
[1:59:20] Heaven that a man may eat thereof and
[1:59:23] not
[1:59:24] die in other words I've given you
[1:59:27] bread but that will make you
[1:59:30] die and if you ever receive any
[1:59:34] help or any financial help or any
[1:59:37] physical help from the ministry that
[1:59:41] will kill
[1:59:43] you it's it's not in there is no
[1:59:47] life that is not the real
[1:59:49] Ministry and that's what Jesus was
[1:59:51] trying to tell us
[1:59:53] and he said I am I am the bread of
[1:59:56] life verse 51 I am the living bread
[1:59:59] which came down from
[2:00:02] heaven If any man eat of this bread he
[2:00:05] shall live forever and the bread that I
[2:00:08] will give is my
[2:00:11] flesh which I will give for the life of
[2:00:13] the
[2:00:15] world the Jews that have a strove within
[2:00:19] themselves how can this man give us
[2:00:22] flesh
[2:00:23] to you know when you begin preaching
[2:00:25] things that are sharp things that are
[2:00:27] real things that people need to change
[2:00:29] their lives then they begin to strive
[2:00:30] within
[2:00:35] themselves then Jesus said unto them
[2:00:39] verily I say unto you except you eat of
[2:00:42] the Flesh of the Son of
[2:00:43] God and drink his
[2:00:46] blood he have no life in you
[2:00:53] praise God what is the what is the blood
[2:00:57] what the Flesh and and blood of the son
[2:00:58] of
[2:01:00] man is the word and the
[2:01:04] spirit unless you receive the
[2:01:07] word and be filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:01:10] you do not have
[2:01:14] life I know you know many some
[2:01:17] Ministries do uh what they call
[2:01:20] um charity Ministry
[2:01:26] you know building
[2:01:29] hospitals to help those who cannot pay
[2:01:31] you for hospital bills Church hospitals
[2:01:35] or they can offeres and things like
[2:01:38] that that is not our
[2:01:41] vision and the reason why it is not is
[2:01:44] because we are giving something that can
[2:01:46] give people life real
[2:01:50] life God will call others to do those
[2:01:52] other
[2:01:53] things but we are called Amen in this
[2:01:56] hour to be the voice of the
[2:02:00] voiceless to be the voice of life in
[2:02:02] this
[2:02:03] generation we are called to bring the
[2:02:05] word to testify the word to the
[2:02:09] Sinners if you receive the word and
[2:02:11] remain a sinner that is your
[2:02:14] business and I've had so many people who
[2:02:18] would comfort themselves oh I'm a sinner
[2:02:21] because so and so is a
[2:02:24] sinner let me tell you on that day you
[2:02:28] will give your own account as an
[2:02:32] individual you may be looking at someone
[2:02:36] when they are never even ever the
[2:02:41] bride what about you you have to know
[2:02:44] your own
[2:02:46] self you have to be sure of your
[2:02:49] calling you have to make sure of your
[2:02:51] calling
[2:02:52] the Bible says make your calling and
[2:02:55] election
[2:02:58] sure let me tell you when I received
[2:03:01] this message I made a
[2:03:06] declaration God Mery but I
[2:03:08] did I said even if my pastor left this
[2:03:13] message I will believe it you know why
[2:03:17] because I was
[2:03:19] convinced that this is the truth and I
[2:03:22] was ready to give my whole
[2:03:25] life I was ready to give my entire
[2:03:30] ambition to give them all up for this
[2:03:34] message and he did not disappoint me I
[2:03:38] am standing before you to say he did not
[2:03:41] disappoint
[2:03:43] me many came to me and they gave false
[2:03:47] prophecies they said your life will
[2:03:49] amount
[2:03:50] nothing I can tell
[2:03:52] today my life did not amount to
[2:03:56] nothing God can never disappoint you if
[2:04:00] you choose to stand with him God can
[2:04:02] never disappoint you if you choose to
[2:04:05] receive the word because this word is
[2:04:08] life he says I am the bread of
[2:04:12] life can we say Amen to
[2:04:16] that and then he continues on to say
[2:04:19] whosoever eateth My Flesh
[2:04:22] and drinketh my
[2:04:24] blood has eternal life and I will raise
[2:04:27] him up at the last
[2:04:29] day for my flesh is me
[2:04:31] indeed and my blood is drink
[2:04:35] indeed he that eateth my flesh and
[2:04:38] drinketh my
[2:04:39] blood dth in me and I in
[2:04:42] him and as the living father has sent
[2:04:45] me and I live by the
[2:04:48] father so he that eateth me
[2:04:53] even he shall live by
[2:04:55] me am let us eat
[2:04:58] Jesus Hallelujah let us eat the word
[2:05:03] whenever we eat the word we are living
[2:05:06] by the
[2:05:07] word by Faith by faith in the Son of
[2:05:11] God and by faith of the Son of
[2:05:15] God this is that
[2:05:18] bread which came down from heaven
[2:05:22] even he shall live by me this the bread
[2:05:25] this is the bread which came down from
[2:05:27] heaven let me tell you we've had people
[2:05:31] who read the
[2:05:33] Quran and they said oh it came from
[2:05:36] Heaven
[2:05:37] okay let me ask you
[2:05:42] something do you know how many years the
[2:05:47] Quran came
[2:05:48] down whever it came from
[2:05:52] after
[2:05:55] Jesus do you know how many years after
[2:05:57] Jesus it
[2:06:03] came about I think 500
[2:06:09] years 500
[2:06:13] years and people are willing to leave
[2:06:16] this for something that came
[2:06:20] later I tell you we are standing on
[2:06:22] Solid
[2:06:24] Ground this came from
[2:06:27] Heaven amen it is not even a book it is
[2:06:30] the man who came down from
[2:06:33] heaven and he lived but everybody
[2:06:38] lived he was buried everybody was buried
[2:06:42] but I tell you he rose again from
[2:06:44] the he's alive today he's alive in the
[2:06:48] hearts of
[2:06:49] the so this is not just a Fe our
[2:06:52] story it is a living
[2:06:57] reality Hallelujah this is that bread
[2:06:59] which came from Heaven not as your
[2:07:02] fathers did eat
[2:07:04] mana and dead he that eateth of this
[2:07:08] bread
[2:07:13] forever these things said here in the
[2:07:17] synagogue as he told in
[2:07:20] cap many
[2:07:22] there of his
[2:07:24] disciples when they had heard this they
[2:07:27] said this is a hard
[2:07:29] saying who can hear
[2:07:31] it they walked
[2:07:34] away when Jesus knew in himself that his
[2:07:36] disciples
[2:07:39] M to
[2:07:41] them does this offend
[2:07:44] you blessed are you who are not offended
[2:07:47] at the
[2:07:49] word hey mhm let me tell you the world
[2:07:54] is offended at the
[2:07:56] world and that's why they're doing
[2:07:58] everything they
[2:08:00] can to remove this Bible from the hands
[2:08:03] of
[2:08:06] men in many places in America you can't
[2:08:09] even have it in in schools
[2:08:13] anym because they have rejected
[2:08:16] God and yet god brother said God blessed
[2:08:19] America because they stood for the word
[2:08:25] but now the more they leave the word the
[2:08:28] more they go down as a
[2:08:30] nation let me tell you as a human being
[2:08:34] and as a nation you know you cannot
[2:08:37] stand without
[2:08:39] God you look at all the civilizations
[2:08:41] before
[2:08:43] us we have many more powerful
[2:08:45] civilization that were on this world
[2:08:51] the times of
[2:08:53] Nebuchadnezzar the median
[2:08:57] Empire the Roman
[2:08:59] Empire and all the other
[2:09:01] empir the Greeks but let me tell you
[2:09:04] through the whole
[2:09:05] [Music]
[2:09:06] time it was
[2:09:09] God in it
[2:09:11] all if you read the book of
[2:09:14] Daniel you will understand that he had
[2:09:17] already said these kingdoms will rule
[2:09:21] this
[2:09:23] world the last Kingdom to
[2:09:26] come the last Gentile
[2:09:29] Kingdom to rule in this world I'll tell
[2:09:32] you what it is is the Roman
[2:09:36] Kingdom but this time it's going to be
[2:09:40] mixed with
[2:09:42] clay and
[2:09:44] iron with with with protestantism and
[2:09:48] liberalism
[2:09:52] and with
[2:09:53] romanism and this is the last
[2:09:55] kingdom is going to rule the world the
[2:09:59] One World
[2:10:00] Government is coming because the Bible
[2:10:03] said
[2:10:05] so and it's going to it's going to rule
[2:10:07] the whole
[2:10:09] world but let me tell you they would use
[2:10:12] religion their first religion and the
[2:10:16] law they have the power to do that but
[2:10:19] all these
[2:10:20] kingdoms all pass away because in the
[2:10:23] Book of Daniel you know he saw he said I
[2:10:27] saw amen there was a
[2:10:30] rock H without hand and he came down and
[2:10:35] hit this
[2:10:37] image and what was this image this image
[2:10:42] was a
[2:10:44] representation of all the kingdoms of
[2:10:47] the Gentiles that had lived before
[2:10:52] but when this rock came
[2:10:54] down are you hearing me church when this
[2:10:58] rock came down it smashed this
[2:11:01] image smash this image and the whole
[2:11:05] image was reduced to
[2:11:09] rubble and there was a voice there was a
[2:11:12] voice the kingdoms of this
[2:11:15] world has become the kingdom of our
[2:11:18] God out of his Christ
[2:11:22] Hallelujah there is coming a time when
[2:11:25] there will be a new
[2:11:28] civilization That civilization will be
[2:11:31] ruled by
[2:11:32] Christ and his bride with him the Bible
[2:11:36] say we shall reign with
[2:11:38] him so don't tell me about any
[2:11:42] Kingdom power the word has been before
[2:11:46] all these
[2:11:47] Kingdom the word has been here through
[2:11:49] the kingdom
[2:11:51] the word will be here after
[2:11:54] this the word will live forever and
[2:11:58] ever when you talk about
[2:12:01] Kings you know there's a king that
[2:12:04] refused to believe in the existence of
[2:12:09] God God told him I will show you that I
[2:12:15] exist he made him
[2:12:18] live like an animal
[2:12:21] eat
[2:12:22] grass grow hair grow nails
[2:12:26] like like an animal until he
[2:12:31] admitted and that was just an example
[2:12:35] for to show you it doesn't matter how
[2:12:37] great a man is in this
[2:12:40] life is no one greater than
[2:12:43] God and that's why the devil doesn't
[2:12:45] like the word he wants to pervert the
[2:12:48] minds of the generation
[2:12:51] change the
[2:12:52] Bible they have written other
[2:12:56] versions even
[2:12:58] homosexuals they have written their own
[2:13:02] Bible even all these
[2:13:06] other they written their
[2:13:08] Bible why because they cannot retain God
[2:13:12] in their
[2:13:15] knowledge and they came to a place where
[2:13:18] they agreed within themselves
[2:13:21] that the god they believe
[2:13:23] in is not of the word of this
[2:13:26] Bible but they know there is a God in
[2:13:30] heaven and they thought to themselves
[2:13:34] these are just words of a
[2:13:35] man men wrote them they let us write our
[2:13:40] own so that when we read them we are not
[2:13:45] condemned but let me tell you they
[2:13:48] cannot change the word of God
[2:13:51] because the word of God is
[2:13:54] unchangeable the word of God is
[2:13:57] permanent and it will still condemn them
[2:14:00] even in hell it will condemn them
[2:14:04] everywhere they go let me tell you every
[2:14:06] sinner that sins they are condemned
[2:14:11] because why the word of God is plac in
[2:14:15] the hearts of
[2:14:17] men whereby if you have a conscious your
[2:14:19] conscious will condemn you
[2:14:24] but the B says They Se so far away from
[2:14:28] God their conscious can't condemn them
[2:14:33] anymore he said their conscious is
[2:14:35] seared with
[2:14:38] ir it's just like when someone goes to
[2:14:40] fornicate the first
[2:14:43] time they feel like they going to die
[2:14:46] what have I
[2:14:48] done and then they get someone to
[2:14:50] comfort
[2:14:52] it's all right it's nothing everybody
[2:14:54] does that and then after a while they're
[2:14:57] like after all
[2:14:59] everybody it is okay but the word of God
[2:15:02] says is not
[2:15:06] okay and that is
[2:15:09] eternal all other voices are
[2:15:15] not and
[2:15:17] so they were offended at it
[2:15:22] let us not be offended at the
[2:15:25] word let us always believe the
[2:15:28] word there were three
[2:15:30] pools Jesus's Ministry first the healing
[2:15:34] of the
[2:15:35] sick the Miracles then the
[2:15:39] designment so the healing of the
[2:15:42] sick the Miracles Drew very
[2:15:46] many by
[2:15:48] thousands and then and then the
[2:15:50] designment
[2:15:54] but the third
[2:15:55] pool it was the opening of the
[2:15:58] word the speaking of the
[2:16:00] word now that one it took many
[2:16:05] away but under the third
[2:16:08] pool that is where the power of change
[2:16:14] is the power to change is under the
[2:16:18] third the power to Amen to to to
[2:16:21] resurrect is under the third
[2:16:24] pool because the third pool is the
[2:16:26] opening of the
[2:16:28] world speaking of the word the third is
[2:16:31] the
[2:16:34] word and so we have many ministries
[2:16:38] Church
[2:16:39] Ministries operating under the first and
[2:16:44] second but you are in the message and
[2:16:47] look at them and know so and Ministry is
[2:16:50] powerful
[2:16:52] but is operating under the
[2:16:54] first healing miracles signs and
[2:16:58] wonders
[2:17:02] of but there's a
[2:17:04] third the ministry of the
[2:17:07] Bride is a third
[2:17:11] Ministry is a Ministry of the
[2:17:14] world what do we find under there
[2:17:18] Resurrection like in 195
[2:17:22] sevenam saw a little
[2:17:25] fish and God told him you give it life
[2:17:30] he didn't pray he didn't ask he spoke he
[2:17:34] said I give you back your life
[2:17:38] and same that Jesus did that thir Min he
[2:17:44] spoke Lazarus come Lazarus came you know
[2:17:49] in Luke 7 he said young man arise and
[2:17:53] the bible say that he that was dead
[2:17:56] s that's a thir
[2:17:58] minen it's a resurrection Ministry what
[2:18:02] I'm talking about is when you sit under
[2:18:04] the third pool
[2:18:05] Ministry the ministry of the world what
[2:18:08] it does is amen it resurrects
[2:18:11] you amen we were born
[2:18:15] dead dead in sins and
[2:18:17] trespasses but this word resurrects us
[2:18:22] out of our
[2:18:24] toss of unbelief TOS of sin Toms of the
[2:18:29] world and
[2:18:31] worldliness and when the word of God
[2:18:33] echoes in your
[2:18:35] ears it goes through your spirit and
[2:18:39] goes direct to your
[2:18:40] soul and then you realize who you are
[2:18:43] you are like I'm never going back here
[2:18:46] you turn your back against the
[2:18:48] world and you take another turn
[2:18:52] that's the power of the third
[2:18:55] Min the third pool Ministry
[2:18:59] creates remember the
[2:19:01] Min were
[2:19:03] created three
[2:19:05] squ I want one here it
[2:19:09] was and he sh all of
[2:19:13] them and had a good
[2:19:15] meal but those squid were not born by
[2:19:19] other squir
[2:19:24] it was
[2:19:25] created
[2:19:28] of That's The Power of the
[2:19:32] third same thing that happened in the
[2:19:35] days of
[2:19:37] Abraham that lamb which was
[2:19:40] created in
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:44] theck and said turn here's your
[2:19:47] sacrifice where did that come from it
[2:19:50] was not born by
[2:19:51] another sheep did not bear
[2:19:54] it it was the word of
[2:19:57] God the word of God
[2:20:01] created Mary became
[2:20:04] pregnant what was that it was not the
[2:20:06] seed of Joseph it was a word of God
[2:20:10] which created something out
[2:20:12] of same thing that will do
[2:20:15] today the power of the thir
[2:20:19] Min can create something out of
[2:20:23] nothing hallelujah amen that's the power
[2:20:27] the cre so when there is nothing in your
[2:20:30] life it can create something in your
[2:20:35] life that's why we love the
[2:20:38] world let me tell you this level is only
[2:20:42] for a
[2:20:43] few the third pool Ministry is only for
[2:20:47] a few it is not for Pentecostal
[2:20:51] not for denominational
[2:20:53] followers not for religious people is
[2:20:56] for the Believers of the
[2:20:59] world hallelujah amen because the word
[2:21:02] has
[2:21:04] power to create and when that power is
[2:21:08] put in action it comes in you and you
[2:21:12] become that
[2:21:14] one and can create life where there has
[2:21:19] been that's
[2:21:21] Ministry has power to bring
[2:21:25] Salvation when brother gave the
[2:21:27] testimony of the
[2:21:33] to she said
[2:21:35] amen that is nothing but the truth I
[2:21:39] believe it
[2:21:40] by that moment that moment the power of
[2:21:44] the third pool
[2:21:46] Ministry was
[2:21:48] activated and the prophet spoke to the
[2:21:51] sister said sister dear ask whatever you
[2:21:55] want ask whatever you want Hallelujah
[2:21:58] now if she had asked for a million
[2:22:00] dollar she would get
[2:22:02] it whatever she would have asked
[2:22:05] for let me tell you for God toen Amen
[2:22:09] put you into that
[2:22:11] room you would have to know your desires
[2:22:16] are aligned to his
[2:22:21] hallelujah amen but she said I won the
[2:22:25] salvation of My Three
[2:22:28] Sons Hallelujah and that very moment
[2:22:32] amen they came one by one falling down
[2:22:36] repenting of their sins let me tell you
[2:22:39] you may be a sinner you may be a sinner
[2:22:42] but if you sit under the power of the
[2:22:44] world there is power to give you
[2:22:47] salvation there power to save you why
[2:22:50] are you unsaved because you can't come
[2:22:53] out of the
[2:22:54] world you're not opening your heart to
[2:22:56] the world the word power even as
[2:23:00] preachers preach what is it
[2:23:03] happening
[2:23:05] waves of the holy ghost that comes and
[2:23:08] picks that and places it upon your heart
[2:23:12] and brings salvation
[2:23:15] to that's why the
[2:23:17] word must be preached
[2:23:22] the Bible says the word must be
[2:23:25] preached the parts of the
[2:23:29] earth must be preached not read only
[2:23:34] that's why you don't only stay at your
[2:23:36] house you must come to church and you
[2:23:39] must be preached to because by hearing
[2:23:42] the word salvation is being
[2:23:45] created hallelujah amen the that's why
[2:23:49] when you hear the word
[2:23:51] it's like a
[2:23:52] force
[2:23:54] that comes upon you and many times we've
[2:23:58] seen it many times I've seen it under my
[2:24:01] Ministry whereby people would just be
[2:24:03] hearing the
[2:24:04] word and the wave of the Holy Ghost just
[2:24:08] come upon a person begin shaking begin
[2:24:10] falling shouting you never touched them
[2:24:14] what was that it is the word that
[2:24:16] provokes things to be to be to begin
[2:24:18] happening
[2:24:21] Amen in the hearts of people whereby
[2:24:24] when they open up the word comes in them
[2:24:29] to begin to Des them and begin to rebuke
[2:24:33] them and begins to convict them
[2:24:36] of conviction comes by hearing the
[2:24:40] word not by going to a
[2:24:42] bar but by hearing the word and the word
[2:24:46] of God not a word of a man
[2:24:51] the power of the
[2:24:54] third it also has
[2:24:57] power over the forces of
[2:25:00] nature you remember one time I was
[2:25:03] reading it in the message Look Away to
[2:25:06] Jesus
[2:25:08] 1963 but the B spoke about the storm
[2:25:13] of came up and when I was arriving in
[2:25:17] Switzerland something tiny to that came
[2:25:22] a storm a blizzard
[2:25:24] came and we were still you know downhill
[2:25:27] and the pastor sent a notice said there
[2:25:29] is a there is a
[2:25:35] snowstorm because the convention center
[2:25:37] was on up on uphill was in the mountains
[2:25:42] there and so
[2:25:44] um the place down was
[2:25:47] okay our car was a little small
[2:25:50] so you began driving
[2:25:52] up you know snow started
[2:25:56] increasing started inreasing it reached
[2:25:58] a place until it now became
[2:26:02] scary because you see the road is
[2:26:05] narrow and the corners are
[2:26:08] sharp and the road is now
[2:26:11] slippery and the snow is becoming you
[2:26:13] know like the width is becoming
[2:26:17] bigger and it came to a place where we
[2:26:21] in cannot now drive through that
[2:26:24] snow I saw the brother
[2:26:26] pray now the brother who was driving was
[2:26:29] praying and I was on the other seat I I
[2:26:32] had never seen snow all my
[2:26:34] life when I saw someone
[2:26:37] pray and he the one driving I was
[2:26:41] worried because I was thinking anything
[2:26:43] can
[2:26:44] happen the road is Tiny the car is
[2:26:48] small there is a huge huge
[2:26:51] cffs whereby you can SK
[2:26:56] and and I was asking him which time are
[2:26:59] we all right he said yes are we all
[2:27:02] right yes now when he began praying I
[2:27:05] was
[2:27:06] worried now I also started praying I
[2:27:09] said God don't let me die in this
[2:27:13] mountain but I believe that snow
[2:27:16] storm was not as heavy as the one by
[2:27:20] up in Canada and as he was in that
[2:27:23] snowstorm he said it had become you know
[2:27:26] the snow had become too
[2:27:29] high and many people had died in such
[2:27:31] kind
[2:27:32] [Music]
[2:27:34] of Imagine to just come and cover you
[2:27:38] up and you know there's nowhere to go
[2:27:41] there's
[2:27:43] no and and he started to go out and try
[2:27:45] to see CU he knew his way but the Holy
[2:27:48] Spirit told him go back and he went back
[2:27:53] and when he reached there he told him am
[2:27:56] I not the one who created
[2:27:59] nature am I not the one who created
[2:28:04] this then he told him speak to this
[2:28:08] St speak to this St Hallelujah and he
[2:28:13] stood and he spoke to the stop and he
[2:28:16] said the stop
[2:28:18] stop and for 3 days there was
[2:28:21] uninterrupted
[2:28:22] [Applause]
[2:28:25] Sunshine hallelujah amen is the same
[2:28:28] same thing like in Luke chapter 8 where
[2:28:32] the Bible tells us you know Jesus he
[2:28:36] arose and he rebuked the wind and the
[2:28:40] Raging of the
[2:28:41] waters and the storm
[2:28:45] C what is that is the power of the third
[2:28:49] Ministry
[2:28:51] amen Joshua in the Old Testament you
[2:28:55] know he stood up also when they were
[2:28:57] fighting and the enemies
[2:29:00] wereing and he knew he did not have more
[2:29:04] hours in the
[2:29:08] day so he said
[2:29:10] no we cannot be defeated we don't want
[2:29:13] Darkness to come God gave him
[2:29:16] Revelation he was taken up higher
[2:29:20] on a third
[2:29:21] phase third
[2:29:23] level Ministry of the
[2:29:26] Bride Hallelujah and he
[2:29:30] said stand
[2:29:32] still Moon stay in your
[2:29:36] place scientifically
[2:29:39] impossible but it
[2:29:41] happen it happen it
[2:29:45] happened and it can happen again again
[2:29:50] amen now let me bring it down
[2:29:53] home when I had just believed the
[2:29:56] message one preacher came and preach
[2:29:58] something like
[2:29:59] this in our little
[2:30:01] church and I was
[2:30:04] amazed and one Sunday
[2:30:07] morning after I had heard what the
[2:30:09] preacher
[2:30:09] preached I was at home and it started
[2:30:12] raining cats and
[2:30:15] dog and I was supposed to me I always
[2:30:18] wanted to go to church
[2:30:21] I always wanted to
[2:30:23] be whenever there was a Serv let me tell
[2:30:27] you when you find a
[2:30:28] Believer and a service is going
[2:30:30] on and they don't want to
[2:30:32] go I'm not saying they not able to
[2:30:35] go I'm saying they don't want to
[2:30:38] go are you hearing me there is a problem
[2:30:42] with their
[2:30:44] experience I always wanted to go to
[2:30:47] church and so I said no I'm going to
[2:30:52] church I stood out in my
[2:30:56] Bible I thought if I go through this
[2:31:00] rain I'm going to be
[2:31:03] sought my Bible will all be
[2:31:08] well I didn't have an
[2:31:10] umbrella because I couldn't
[2:31:14] afford but I wanted to go to

[2:31:23] of course I didn't have a
[2:31:24] car I didn't even have a bicycle but I
[2:31:27] wanted to go
[2:31:29] toch so I remembered what the brother
[2:31:31] had
[2:31:33] preached
[2:31:36] over there were some people on the other
[2:31:41] Verandas and so they saw me do but I
[2:31:44] didn't have an option I knew if it
[2:31:47] doesn't happen I'm going to be
[2:31:47] embarrassed
[2:31:51] but I did it
[2:31:53] anyhow I said rain in the name of Jesus
[2:31:57] I command you to stop until I come back
[2:32:00] home from church then you can
[2:32:04] start and I I continued standing there
[2:32:09] and the other people started
[2:32:10] laughing so I started praying slowly I
[2:32:13] said God don't ashame
[2:32:16] me but friends God can never
[2:32:21] hallelujah amen each time I've stood for
[2:32:25] God he never ashamed me I've ashamed him
[2:32:29] many times but he has never ashamed me
[2:32:32] whenever I stood for him don't fear to
[2:32:35] stand for
[2:32:36] him stand for the word he can never sh
[2:32:41] you do you want to know what happened it
[2:32:44] just went
[2:32:48] like MH and it was calm and I speak in
[2:32:54] the name of the Lord it started
[2:32:59] shining I took my
[2:33:02] Bible started walking the
[2:33:04] church I forgot about it even when I was
[2:33:08] at church I forgot about it I didn't
[2:33:11] remember what had happened the morning
[2:33:13] when I came back and he started powering
[2:33:17] again with even Hil storms
[2:33:20] that's when I remembered I start
[2:33:22] thanking God thank you Jesus you did it
[2:33:26] you did it let me tell you the power of
[2:33:29] the third
[2:33:31] pH the power of the
[2:33:33] word it has power over
[2:33:37] nature over
[2:33:39] nature to realize
[2:33:41] nature when Nature is
[2:33:44] misbehaving has power
[2:33:46] over even over your nature when your
[2:33:50] nature is
[2:33:51] misbehaving you can speak life you can
[2:33:54] speak life and control it by the power
[2:33:58] of the
[2:34:00] word
[2:34:02] hallelujah you see why the word is
[2:34:05] powerful and Jesus is the word but when
[2:34:08] he spoke the word they were
[2:34:12] offended and what did they do they left
[2:34:17] him now I'm trying to bring you to a
[2:34:19] clima
[2:34:24] in just a few
[2:34:26] moments 6 six from that
[2:34:29] time many of his disciples went
[2:34:33] [Music]
[2:34:35] back and they walked no more with
[2:34:38] him he engaged the
[2:34:40] first they said yeah you are our Prophet
[2:34:45] you our
[2:34:47] King you the best pastor in the world
[2:34:53] all
[2:34:56] right oh yes this is lovely prophecy
[2:35:03] designment Hallelujah you are my pastor
[2:35:09] forever all right
[2:35:19] he that doesn't eat my fles doesn't
[2:35:22] drink my blood worth of
[2:35:27] me we thought that you are going to be
[2:35:29] our
[2:35:33] pastor and work no more with
[2:35:38] him they went back and work no more with
[2:35:42] him then
[2:35:44] Jesus started
[2:35:47] crying because his followers had left
[2:35:50] and he told them please come
[2:35:56] back so the sleepers say now
[2:36:05] yes he looked to the the 12
[2:36:08] disciples he told them they have left
[2:36:12] will you also go
[2:36:15] away then Simon
[2:36:18] Peter oh I love that question will you
[2:36:21] go
[2:36:22] away there used to be a
[2:36:25] preacher in in our church we used to say
[2:36:28] if you don't want what I'm preaching go
[2:36:32] away go where you came
[2:36:35] from your denomination and it always
[2:36:38] offended me and I was like can't leave
[2:36:41] that and PR the
[2:36:44] word evangelists have a way
[2:36:47] of striking you and
[2:36:51] but Jesus one time was also an
[2:36:54] evangelist he said will you also go
[2:36:58] away to the disciples that he
[2:37:02] had Simon
[2:37:05] answer
[2:37:06] Lord Lord to whom shall we
[2:37:11] go Hallelujah somebody here Al to say
[2:37:14] the same
[2:37:16] thing to whom shall we go
[2:37:20] who shall we go who can do powerful
[2:37:25] Miracles is that
[2:37:27] it to whom shall we go that can give us
[2:37:31] some money
[2:37:33] when to whom shall we
[2:37:37] go who has words
[2:37:42] of Hallelujah take everything and give
[2:37:45] me the
[2:37:47] word take your religion and give me the
[2:37:50] take your money and give me
[2:37:52] the take your associations and
[2:37:55] organizations take your friendships
[2:37:57] take give me the
[2:38:00] word I will choose the word each
[2:38:04] time and we believe and assure that thou
[2:38:08] Christ they did not only believe they
[2:38:12] were
[2:38:15] sure about what you believe we are not
[2:38:18] called to be Church MERS
[2:38:21] I am not here to be a church
[2:38:23] member I refuse to be only a church
[2:38:26] member I am here to be a follower of
[2:38:31] Jesus believe it and be sure of
[2:38:36] it they left Jesus's
[2:38:39] Ministry because their interest was not
[2:38:41] the
[2:38:42] word they always leave when the interest
[2:38:45] is not the word
[2:38:50] I remember I told you a story in
[2:38:51] Ethiopia one
[2:38:52] time we went and baptized the
[2:38:55] pastor Pentecostal Pastor who had
[2:38:58] claimed to have believ the
[2:38:59] message and after we had preached in his
[2:39:02] church but we notic something when never
[2:39:05] we preaching the
[2:39:06] word these people were always
[2:39:09] doing but whenever he came up and he
[2:39:14] began mirac everybody's aw everybody
[2:39:18] jumping everybody
[2:39:20] so I notic there's a problem here if
[2:39:23] this is good and right why is this
[2:39:26] making
[2:39:27] people when the word begins to make
[2:39:29] people do there's a problem with that
[2:39:34] church there is a problem with what
[2:39:36] they're standing
[2:39:38] for and that Pastor came to me said I
[2:39:41] want you to baptize me and he came with
[2:39:44] his
[2:39:44] associate and we bapti both of them in
[2:39:47] the name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:39:49] baptism is not a ticket to
[2:39:53] Heaven it's only a testimony that you
[2:39:56] believe but if you don't believe and do
[2:39:58] it it amounts to nothing so we baptized
[2:40:02] him and he saided coming each time you I
[2:40:07] have this
[2:40:08] proposal I need you to you know if you
[2:40:11] you have some people who can support
[2:40:13] us and you connect us to
[2:40:15] them we have this
[2:40:18] project to build our church we need this
[2:40:21] much
[2:40:22] money and I'm like but is it
[2:40:25] Pastor sorry I mentioned his name his
[2:40:27] name so I said I told him but
[2:40:31] pastor each time we
[2:40:34] meet you talk about money and needs
[2:40:38] that's all
[2:40:39] okay but my interest with you is the
[2:40:46] word he say yeah I love the one but now
[2:40:51] you cannot preach without
[2:40:53] money well as long as you are preaching
[2:40:55] to the ones who came for
[2:40:58] food but if you preaching to the ones
[2:41:00] who need the word you can even preach
[2:41:01] when they under a
[2:41:05] tree so I told him we may not connect
[2:41:09] very
[2:41:10] well let's let this not be the
[2:41:14] approach so over time over
[2:41:17] time so I decided in my in
[2:41:20] myself CU it was like telling me you see
[2:41:24] you can even come and bapti all my
[2:41:27] members as long as I tell them they just
[2:41:31] accept and then you would send
[2:41:33] testimonies and you know you can also be
[2:41:37] supported the day he said
[2:41:40] that he provoked
[2:41:43] me and I told him this is not why I came
[2:41:47] to
[2:41:48] Ethiopia if I leave Ethiopia with only
[2:41:51] two Souls but genuine Believers that's
[2:41:54] enough I am not going to make
[2:41:58] merchandise of the
[2:42:00] gohost and I disconnected myself from
[2:42:02] him and after so long about
[2:42:06] um seven months eight
[2:42:08] months his associate came back to
[2:42:12] me he said pastor now I've come to join
[2:42:16] you I've come to join you Pentecost can
[2:42:19] do it really
[2:42:21] well he said I've come to submit myself
[2:42:25] under your
[2:42:28] ministry I said
[2:42:31] under I know I baptized you but I also
[2:42:34] know how we separated with
[2:42:37] you so how come that you
[2:42:40] here you know that man is's not a good
[2:42:44] man he's not a good man at all because
[2:42:47] even he didn't even know how to read the
[2:42:48] Bible
[2:42:49] it was even me reading the Bible for him
[2:42:52] and he will just speak
[2:42:54] it he just all about money and and we
[2:42:57] even
[2:42:58] disagreed and I thought let me even tell
[2:43:01] you the secret he actually told me I was
[2:43:04] being
[2:43:05] baptized after all is the name of Jesus
[2:43:08] it doesn't matter let me do it so they
[2:43:11] can give us money so that's why we got
[2:43:15] baptized so Pastor me I'm coming to
[2:43:17] submit myself under your ministry
[2:43:19] because I'm going to sincerely support
[2:43:21] your
[2:43:27] work I told
[2:43:30] him brother I'm happy to see now I was
[2:43:34] like
[2:43:35] Jesus when you saw the
[2:43:38] Thousand phip do we have enough
[2:43:43] food I knew this man was coming for
[2:43:46] food not for the word
[2:43:50] how do you know them that's how they
[2:43:53] come they talk evil about everybody
[2:43:58] else and they praise
[2:44:00] you so they can provoke you
[2:44:05] to right be careful of anyone who talks
[2:44:10] evil of
[2:44:11] anyone even if that anyone was your
[2:44:17] enemy you remember the man who came
[2:44:20] to
[2:44:22] David our enem is
[2:44:26] dead told him kill
[2:44:29] him they killed him why how could he
[2:44:33] speak that of my
[2:44:36] enemy his God is Anointed
[2:44:39] too he ought not to have spoken
[2:44:42] about it not something good it is
[2:44:45] something sad what am I trying to say
[2:44:50] friends when they left Jesus's
[2:44:52] Ministry they were not interested in the
[2:44:55] word and Jesus was not pulling for a
[2:45:01] following he asked even the remaining to
[2:45:06] go sometimes in the ministry you have to
[2:45:09] provoke people to
[2:45:13] go because sometimes it may be very
[2:45:18] important
[2:45:20] to maintain a
[2:45:22] Revival when there are many who want
[2:45:27] food more than they
[2:45:30] were Jesus had to provoke
[2:45:33] them can go they said no where can we go
[2:45:38] who to who has the words
[2:45:42] of they have always
[2:45:44] left they left Paul
[2:45:47] one and these are for our
[2:45:50] examples Paul wrote to Timothy and he
[2:45:53] said to
[2:45:54] him has forsaken
[2:45:56] me having loved this present
[2:45:59] world and Deus and is departed
[2:46:04] to but he said take
[2:46:07] Mark and also look is with
[2:46:10] me and take Mark bring him with you
[2:46:15] meaning bring him to me he is profitable
[2:46:18] to me for the min
[2:46:22] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you
[2:46:25] profitable for the
[2:46:28] ministry oh I feel like talking T right
[2:46:30] now let me tell you brother sister you

[2:51:08] I said yes I
[2:51:11] will and a few others as well I'm
[2:51:14] willing to help if I can somebody who
[2:51:18] wants
[2:51:19] something but I'm sick and
[2:51:22] tired of being
[2:51:24] pulled into supporting and
[2:51:27] help when it's not going to amount to
[2:51:36] anything praise
[2:51:39] God and so uh first John chapter
[2:51:44] 2 and I'll finish in a moment here if
[2:51:46] you give me a few more moments here
[2:51:51] you want me to finish I see no say what
[2:51:54] I said brother don't want to lie the
[2:51:56] people amen little
[2:51:59] children it is the last
[2:52:02] time and it is the last
[2:52:05] time and as ye have heard that
[2:52:07] Antichrist shall
[2:52:10] come even now are there many
[2:52:13] Antichrist whereby we know that it is
[2:52:16] the last time
[2:52:19] they went out from
[2:52:20] us but they were not of
[2:52:23] us they had been of us they no doubt
[2:52:27] have continued with
[2:52:29] us but they went out that they might be
[2:52:33] made manifest that they were not all of
[2:52:38] us and in in John
[2:52:43] 6:44 no man can come to me except the
[2:52:45] Father which has sent me draw him
[2:52:50] and I will raise him up at the last
[2:52:52] day it is written in the prophets and
[2:52:56] they shall be all T of
[2:52:58] God every man therefore has heard and
[2:53:02] land of the
[2:53:03] father cometh to me praise God you see
[2:53:08] he says he draws his own are always
[2:53:11] being drawn
[2:53:18] there was a young man here
[2:53:21] recently and this just came to my mind I
[2:53:23] wasn't ining to talk
[2:53:26] about that you know came and it was
[2:53:29] during
[2:53:30] Co said pastor I want to you know join
[2:53:33] the assembly
[2:53:34] here I said but we have no assembly we
[2:53:37] just beginning in our house
[2:53:39] fellow he said well I feel I should you
[2:53:41] know be a part of
[2:53:42] you I said all right where have you been
[2:53:45] told me the church so he came and joined
[2:53:48] and um for a while he was there shortly
[2:53:51] after
[2:53:52] that I want to marry
[2:53:55] sister
[2:53:56] and after a
[2:53:59] while I heard and I speak this on on the
[2:54:02] P pit for a purpose I heard that he
[2:54:07] actually
[2:54:09] expected that I would marry for
[2:54:12] him you know Pastor has money he's
[2:54:16] going and when they asked him for lot of
[2:54:20] things he could not pay
[2:54:23] them and he kind of wanted to call off
[2:54:26] the whole
[2:54:29] thing but I waited for him to come and
[2:54:31] tell me that you are supposed to uh pay
[2:54:35] pay for
[2:54:38] me that sounds
[2:54:40] unreal but it was his
[2:54:44] expectation it is sad isn't it
[2:54:49] doesn't come to church
[2:54:51] again very long time
[2:54:53] afterwards you know sometimes I'm a
[2:54:55] person who doesn't ridicule or talk
[2:54:57] about
[2:55:00] people but sometimes when it is
[2:55:02] necessary the congregation it is
[2:55:05] important to talk about
[2:55:07] it because things go
[2:55:10] around and you not never addressed
[2:55:15] them we need to be mature people
[2:55:19] with a mature
[2:55:22] understanding and so later on um you
[2:55:26] know spends quite a long time without
[2:55:29] coming to
[2:55:30] church and then uh he says Pastor I have
[2:55:33] something to speak to
[2:55:35] you what is it I'm still a member of the
[2:55:39] church in myself I laughed you a member
[2:55:43] who doesn't pay TI who doesn't attend
[2:55:46] church who streams he may even be
[2:55:48] streaming
[2:55:49] now who streams and you never attend
[2:55:52] church but everybody knows you as a
[2:55:54] member no you're not a member
[2:55:57] that you are a member of a
[2:55:59] church when you are a member of the
[2:56:03] church right we've gone already through
[2:56:06] that and so later on writes me a long
[2:56:11] message now Pastor I'm sorry I just
[2:56:14] wanted to let you
[2:56:16] know I I went back to the church where I
[2:56:19] was
[2:56:21] at and you know long story short so I
[2:56:24] told him
[2:56:25] brother it is all right if you went back
[2:56:29] to the the church where you went
[2:56:32] at I never called you in the
[2:56:35] past but you should have had enough
[2:56:40] responsibility like you came to me
[2:56:43] physically to come to me physically and
[2:56:46] inform me the same God who led you to
[2:56:50] come has
[2:56:53] you you never had the
[2:56:56] GS you just send me on
[2:56:59] Whatsapp I've realized Our Generation
[2:57:01] needs to really be
[2:57:04] corrected you know there are certain
[2:57:06] things you speak with people on
[2:57:09] WhatsApp especially if people are more
[2:57:11] mature than
[2:57:13] you and people to be
[2:57:15] honored as those who gives you the word
[2:57:18] of
[2:57:19] and are those
[2:57:20] things you need to meet them
[2:57:24] [Music]
[2:57:26] one and tell them
[2:57:29] your rather than send a
[2:57:33] WhatsApp we need to be
[2:57:36] respectable we need to be a generation
[2:57:38] that respects Ministers
[2:57:42] of I'm one person who respects all
[2:57:45] pastors
[2:57:48] never speak of against
[2:57:50] any I never do that because I believe
[2:57:53] all of them are men of God they not
[2:57:56] things the way I see
[2:57:57] it but I I can only give you what God
[2:58:00] has given me to give
[2:58:03] you no man can give you what he doesn't
[2:58:07] have you can only receive what he
[2:58:11] has praise God and if any of our
[2:58:15] brothers and sisters here any member
[2:58:19] ever at one point
[2:58:22] felt you know I'm not comfortable
[2:58:27] here but I feel to go and attend church
[2:58:30] somewhere
[2:58:32] else you don't need to you know walk
[2:58:34] like a
[2:58:37] snake come meet
[2:58:41] me I promise you I'll be very
[2:58:45] gracious I will ask you a question
[2:58:47] though
[2:58:49] why are you
[2:58:51] doing have we grieved
[2:58:53] you or is the Lord
[2:58:58] leading
[2:59:00] ising I am not going to question
[2:59:03] God is it God is it not God if it is God
[2:59:08] it is
[2:59:09] God if you say it is God then it is
[2:59:13] God and I will bless you it's just like
[2:59:16] this young man are you a young
[2:59:20] man he came to me with his wife and told
[2:59:23] me we've been another
[2:59:25] Ministry God has led us to come did I
[2:59:30] invite you
[2:59:32] brother no no did I invite
[2:59:36] you where is Sister Juliet raise up your
[2:59:39] hand did I call and invite you or call
[2:59:41] your
[2:59:42] husband you and your husband came on in
[2:59:48] our home and informed us God has led
[2:59:52] us I advised you one thing God has go
[2:59:56] back to your pastor and tell him the
[3:00:00] same I receive you with open
[3:00:05] arm you know when we talk about
[3:00:07] churches it's not our
[3:00:10] homes neither our
[3:00:12] family you are not I don't own
[3:00:16] you I don't own no
[3:00:19] you are owned by Jesus
[3:00:22] Christ you can go you can come but be
[3:00:27] respectable do things in
[3:00:30] order that way you will serve the pastor
[3:00:33] the trouble of talking about this and
[3:00:35] that and they will just be studying and
[3:00:37] preaching the
[3:00:40] word and so um the ones that are drawn
[3:00:45] by the word
[3:00:48] they will always
[3:00:51] stay but the ones that drawn by other
[3:00:55] things they will always
[3:00:57] do but I'm so thankful that I came into
[3:01:01] this message because I was drawn by the
[3:01:06] word by the
[3:01:08] word not by friendship
[3:01:13] relationship by the word by the word
[3:01:17] praise God
[3:01:19] let us stand on the feet I just I've
[3:01:21] left about two pages
[3:01:38] but and that's the word we contend
[3:01:44] for you know the Bible says he was on
[3:01:46] Earth
[3:01:49] and he did not follow his own
[3:01:52] thoughts he did not follow his own
[3:01:55] will but he sacrificed his own
[3:01:59] will and his own thoughts he sacrificed
[3:02:03] it
[3:02:04] all to follow the mind and the will of
[3:02:08] the
[3:02:10] father that's what we need to
[3:02:13] do Christ came to do the will of the
[3:02:16] father
[3:02:18] we are here not to contend for our
[3:02:23] thoughts but to contend for his
[3:02:26] thoughts for his
[3:02:28] word we have been manifested here to do
[3:02:32] the will of the
[3:02:34] father to do his word
[3:02:36] to to whom shall we go we cannot leave
[3:02:40] the
[3:02:41] word to whom shall we go who has words
[3:02:45] of eternal life
[3:02:48] he said I am the
[3:02:49] way I am the truth I am the
[3:02:53] life friends others may go and walk away
[3:02:58] from this
[3:02:59] message sometimes even walk away from
[3:03:01] the
[3:03:03] fellow but I want you to stick to
[3:03:05] that remain with the word that's why we
[3:03:09] are
[3:03:10] called we are called to stay
[3:03:13] with how many here will stand with the
[3:03:16] word so Lord help to stand with the
[3:03:19] word I will stand with the
[3:03:22] word I want to be
[3:03:26] faithful oh help us Lord Jesus to be
[3:03:30] faithful to you all the words have said
[3:03:33] and maybe even some words I did not
[3:03:35] intend to say but somehow I was late to
[3:03:39] say Lord Jesus let it impact the people
[3:03:45] positively and if there is something
[3:03:47] negative saying

[3:34:36] huj brother
[3:34:39] Jo amen yes reception
[3:34:52] actually the bride and the
[3:34:56] groom they requested
[3:34:59] me and say that they desire their desire
[3:35:02] is to be in church on Sunday
[3:35:07] morning and so we it's a weekend we're
[3:35:12] going to be busy the whole
[3:35:14] weekend Friday we are going to some few
[3:35:18] family members will be going for the
[3:35:21] introduction and I think a few church
[3:35:23] members who were
[3:35:26] invited uh we go about 30 people
[3:35:31] there and then
[3:35:34] on on
[3:35:37] Saturday that will be the
[3:35:40] wedding and then Sunday we shall have a
[3:35:43] service and they desire to be in the
[3:35:45] service
[3:35:48] those things can happen usually when the
[3:35:50] wedding is finished
[3:35:55] early okay so if everybody is seated by
[3:36:02] 9:30 within one
[3:36:05] hour we shall be out of the
[3:36:08] church you even remember and wedding I
[3:36:11] wasn't
[3:36:12] long I think within one hour we out
[3:36:16] the only issue is the bride entage took
[3:36:18] long to
[3:36:20] arrive and so that took quite some
[3:36:24] time but if everybody arrives on
[3:36:27] time and by uh 9:30 we are out of church
[3:36:32] by
[3:36:34] 10:30 we'll be out of church so
[3:36:37] everybody is invited to
[3:36:40] church don't say I wasn't invited at
[3:36:43] re support
[3:36:46] so I'm not going to go to the
[3:36:48] wedding iused to so don't do that it's
[3:36:53] not a good
[3:36:54] spirit if you're a church
[3:36:57] member come and support your very
[3:37:01] own these are young people from our
[3:37:04] church and we need to show them
[3:37:07] love and we need to be there for
[3:37:11] them even if you're already
[3:37:13] married because we always tend to
[3:37:16] believe that the unmarried are the ones
[3:37:17] who will need to be there to support so
[3:37:19] they can also be
[3:37:23] supported so everybody will be invited
[3:37:28] here at 9
[3:37:31] a.m.
[3:37:32] amen then uh on sun on I think the
[3:37:36] reception I don't need to talk much
[3:37:37] about the
[3:37:38] reception because if you going to the
[3:37:42] reception then you you already like he
[3:37:45] said you'll be given a
[3:37:49] card and um everything will be known
[3:37:52] there reception will also take very
[3:37:54] little
[3:37:57] time usually what takes reception is
[3:38:00] delaying to arrive and then food and
[3:38:03] then but since it's a
[3:38:05] hotel we expect they will serve us at
[3:38:08] the time we
[3:38:10] want and also uh we shall arrive there
[3:38:13] on time
[3:38:15] so by 3 or
[3:38:19] 4 everything should be
[3:38:22] done because on Sunday we have another
[3:38:26] wonderful
[3:38:27] time we have ministers from
[3:38:30] Kenya going to come here on
[3:38:33] Sunday be
[3:38:35] expectant God is going to visit
[3:38:38] us and uh come
[3:38:41] expecting and
[3:38:43] praying then on the next
[3:38:47] Sunday we are going to host
[3:38:52] pastor of
[3:38:54] speckled so I'd like you to be
[3:38:58] expectant be in prayer for that
[3:39:01] meeting is making a big sacrifice to
[3:39:04] come and
[3:39:06] Min because it means he would need to
[3:39:08] leave his
[3:39:11] ministry and come to minister to us so
[3:39:15] it's a
[3:39:15] sacrifice I know it because I've done
[3:39:17] before for some and I know as a pastor
[3:39:19] it's
[3:39:21] difficult so let us pray for him and
[3:39:25] pray for that
[3:39:26] Sunday and prepare also to invite your
[3:39:30] friends to come and be a part
[3:39:33] of so I Brother Martin I see you here do
[3:39:36] you have another announcement could you
