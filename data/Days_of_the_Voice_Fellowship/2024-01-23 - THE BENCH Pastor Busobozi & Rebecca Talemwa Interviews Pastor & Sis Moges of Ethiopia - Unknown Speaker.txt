TRANSCRIPT
========================================
yes praise the lord we are happy to be here uh on this interview with our precious uh pastor morgus and his wife but before we we start we would like to just read a little portion of our scripture here this inter is going to be mainly on marriage uh just to help out our young people and give them a testimony on how we believe a perfect marriage should go because we believe that there is like a that a perfect marriage an example of what perfect marriage should be like in the Book of Proverbs chapter 18 verse 22 says who so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and obtaineth favor of the Lord and by the bam in the message my life story 1959 he says so but now a good woman is a jewel in a man's Crown she should be honored my mother's a woman my wife is and they are lovely and I've got thousands of Christian Christian sisters who I highly respect he says but if they can respect what what God made them a motherhood and a real queen that's all right she's one of the best things that God could give a man was a wife besides salvation a wife is the best thing if she's a good wife but if she isn't Solomon said a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown and um oh no one is and that is right it's the worst thing could happen if she is not so we see that uh what I wanted you to see there is that uh beside salvation a wife is the best thing that God could give a man and in Proverbs as we saw he says that a man obtaineth favor of the Lord if he find it a good way and so uh we are here to just give a little testimony for just a few a few minutes God has PR privileged US today to be uh together here with my wife and uh and pastor morgas and his wife I think I'll just let them greet you first and then we can go into the interview asking them a questions here and there so I think we'll begin with my wife uh she just greet you say a few remarks and then we can have the others GRE you as well God bless you I'm so grateful for this wonderful time that God has done for usy about the goodness of the Lord through the life of our brother sister the Lord bless you as you listen well uh then uh so comes uh Pastor morus I think I'll just uh let you go first just read the people I think it's the first interview I'm I'm being live with my wife so my wife has never spoken to the people directly like that so that was nice beautiful thank you dear so Pastor morus if you can also greet the people the viewers who are viewing us and who shall view us later well I just want to also greet you all uh Believers brethren who believe this message uh we are so grateful also to be found in this place to give our little uh testimony how the Lord took us uh through our marriage uh process or that time until today we just want to glorify God in our lives and God bless you as you listen these testimonies yeah sister Mercy you'd like as as well to greet us viewers God bless you friends sister Mercy it's a privilege and an honor that God has given us to just speak to you from our hearts what God has done he says Speak Of The Marvelous things that I have done so that in the ears of my people they may know the goodness of the Lord he's still alive and he's still working and he's still answers prayer so may what we speak be what God will put in our hearts that it can the young people who want to pursue this journey this blessed Journey U and be blessed amen uh we we have a lot to say to you today we have a lot of testimonies they have a lot of testimonies but we do not have time uh it's um they've been quite busy in Uganda I know you've been here for almost two weeks now and uh after this interview they just rush into the airport fly out of Uganda and so but we're just stealing a few minutes of their time their valuable time for them to be able to share their testimony with us so because of that we just straight away go to the questions but before we we do that uh I know that in the message this is really meant for the young people in the message because in the message we have an issue where many young people have come to a place where they think or they feel that the message is constraining them and it is difficult and it is impossible for them to you know find lifetime partn or find a wife or find a husband and some of them have opted to doing what we call PCM or or that is preach convert marry they want to go out and preach to somebody and then convert them and then marry them so really these people come into the message not because of their faith but because they have been a promised marriage and so they don't they don't come in on the right basis but we know that the message is what is preparing us for the coming of the Lord and so we know that's our purpose uh and before we go to to um uh to the questions on marriage and how this happened I know that people would also be interested to know how you uh just briefly don't go into a lot of detail uh how long you've been in the message and how you came into the message and what this message means to you both of you if you feel to just answer I know there are three questions and there are quite many but just uh get that people would be blessed by that as well well uh myself um I come from uh family religion I was Orthodox that family that that religion was just a family religion we knew it uh from family and we were born in it and uh but when I came to uh the knowledge of the word and salvation of my soul uh and embracing this message it's been now about it's going to be 11 years it's heading to be 11 years and I've been in the message for I can say 11 years uh from that time the Lord Has Done many things in my life he has converted me I know our Prophet would say after conversion there is experience conversion brings experience with the Lord himself so after I believed I know I've had a lot of experience with a lord in different places and at different times and um from that uh when I believed little did I know that I would be a minister of this Gospel of this message but when the Lord calls into it I just accepted the leadership of the holy spirit amen sister Mary just a little bit briefly how you came into the message and how long you've been in the message and what it means to you oh for me um it happens that I was actually born in the crowle of the message like we say both my parents were already had believed the message in the 1970s my background is actually from the Kenyan origin and uh when they believed I'm the Third born in my family but uh when I was young the message was not so treasured for me until about when I was about 20 24 25 is really when I began to really see that it's it's just not the message of a man something personal with the Lord It's the voice of God to me and I took it as that and from that time my life completely transformed and uh the ministry that God even put us under he called Pastor VI Cabell in Kenya it really grounded me and that is where I started receiving my conversion so if I can count from that time is almost about maybe 15 16 years I think so you you had an experience with God yes I did and uh no wonder he say that conversion brings an experience correct and uh so that is the beginning of God working in your life that was actually the beginning when I went to the miss church with pastor we how old were you then I was about 27 I think 27 yes and did marriage cross your mind at that time actually I was not even going for marriage it was actually it was so Supernatural how we when went to that church I've been speaking to my sister for several years we should go to moranga road but we knew in Kenya the town moranga is quite far from the city so we didn't hit the call but one day God brought a brother and he told us no it's just within the city so he told us like on a Sunday next Sunday we were inting this church so God supernaturally leads you to this church supernaturally and there you were raised and there you are raised spiritually so spiritually we were raised so spiritually the foundation of the message is right the concept of the message is right the experience is right how they present the Holy Ghost to you how they present the reality it's a personal relationship and a personal walk with the Lord Jesus Christ it really sank in me and uh once the Lord started working with me I started also working with the children so for me it was so complete I was not looking for anything else so now uh did you during this whole time of course 27 is a marital age about did you pray sometimes about marriage and maybe about your lifetime partner did you ever dream about it did you ever desire it when I when I when I got to the card in Pastor W's church I actually started putting it before the Lord and presenting it to the Lord because I felt that this was the right time for me to get married so I was just presenting it sincerely to the Lord but what I told the Lord is I'm really trusting in you if I go by my eyes I'll make a very bad mistake but what I'll do I'll trust you and I remember specific words I was telling him is uh I want to see what's your choice for me because you are the one that gave adam Eve you knew how tall she's supposed to be you knew everything how Eve is supposed to be for Adam and I rested on that so I told the Lord I'll wait for you and I want to see what you're going to choose for me let me see your choice amen so the whole time you waited upon God Faithfully yes I did I wasn't even looking Pastor W church is a very big church in Kenya but I wasn't looking because I had told him I'll wait for you let me see how you going to choose for me yeah and so because in this generation pastor morus we have a lot of young people especially sisters that have started proposing to brothers and others preempt them you know they give their contacts brother please let us be in touch and they they really try hard especially when they see someone who they think is right for them others even tell them these days I love you imagine a sister proposing to a brother saying that I love you but the whole time the sister Faithfully served God and waited because we believe that's what our Prophet has told us that a woman should pray and wait and this is what sister Mari did the whole time and so then while she's waiting and praying praying and so God leads us to Ethiopia myself and my wife and I'm glad that she's with me here today and uh it's a long story but maybe to make it short before we uh we begin interviewing pastor morgas and how they arrived here then in Ethiopia at a time we we we moved there with my wife and God does a work there and several people believe now we we we were laboring at that time and this is very significant because it's really the the the root of this whole testimony uh we have only a a handful of of people in the church say about 15 20 in the church and and these are all young people and they're new to the message and the message is new in the entire country of Ethiopia at that time and uh these are not married I think we we do not have any person who was married one couple joined us who were married but others came in as young people and most of them are feeling incom incompatible to one another but then one time uh I'm I'm I'm I'm ministering and uh I was fed with um you know I read a quote where by bam says that under no circumstance these people talk about 20 25 people in a country where you have more than a 100 million people and these are the only Believers in the country and you have to preach that so I prayed really I I wrestled with God I said should I really preach this or I shouldn't I really prayed and then I tried to inquire from a few friends of mine everybody had their opinion but I said to myself I'm going to take what the word says and if God cannot be able to stand behind that word then he's not God but I know he's God and he will be able to back up his word so I preached it anyhow and this is just goes out to encourage the young people uh who hears the pastors you know preaching this because we've done that even even we've done that at dvf here and many young people are offended at that say how can you say under no circumstance should a a Believer M an unbeliever maybe I have a girlfriend there and maybe they're not Believers but they are good people in the church there are no believers they not there is no one to marry but listen I want you to watch this by the time you finish this testimony you will know that God is God and God will always stay with his word and God will only honor one thing he will not honor a man but he will hor honor his word and if any man or any woman honors God's word God will honor them and so I preached it anyhow and um you know it was very hard on the young people that were in the church and the Believers that were in the church because most of them were not married and they were not seeing any other believers elsewhere in the country to get married to but um so lo and behold we just continued and and uh trying to find where to uh bring in my wife then so that she can speak this portion because we don't have much time and we we we want to just go straight away to the uh to the testimony of the of of Pastor morus and his wife and so one time I'm in the church and and uh we are having um a a wedding our first wedding and uh during that time of the first wedding uh the the several people come even from Kenya and uh I remember that uh when we saw Sister conister Sister Mari was among the group that came from Kenya and we we did not know her myself I did not know her my wife did not know her but our precious brother Paul who had been my coworker in the ministry in Ethiopia during the mission trips at that time was always coming with us from Nairobi and so because of him and and the connection with with Nairobi the Saints in aabi came and were part of the of the wedding there and so when we saw her I think you were the first to say something to her was I was was it myself or was it you I think I was the first what did you say do you remember what you say yeah this girl was she loved the Lord and looked to be sweet she was and here we Hadas our son who was not married I think God revealed something to me so and I always wanted the best for him because of the ministry we we thought God had a big plan for by that time but he had he was not yet married so when I saw this sister I loved her and I blamed her I said sister you here having morus in mind and she answered me amen yeah so uh she I don't know whether people are hearing your sound my wife has a very sweet Sound small sound so she was saying that uh she looked at at her and said we claim you here and she said amen I loved her faith too when I heard her say Amen they were walking behind me actually I remember I turned and I said yes sister we claim you here she again said amen and so uh I don't know what was going through your mind at that time sister m actually nothing I was very excited to be in Ethiopia maybe if I can just say a little bit of how I came first so Pastor wickliff announced that one of the Believers is getting married in Ethiopia if anybody in the congregation would want to go and honor their wedding it will be on Saturday so because I didn't know the couple in my mind I knew I'm not going so come that Wednesday my sister Sarah asked me my big sister our firstborn she she told me Mery why don't we go for that wedding in Ethiopia I told her we don't even know the couple why should we go so I left the thought on Thursday I somebody sent me 50,000 on my phone it was a jubilee there was a policy I had so they paid me that Thursday I didn't know so I called my sister Sarah Sarah I got some money on the phone and uh I think it can fit she told me check the tickets I check the tickets 25,000 per person exactly for her and for me so I told her okay can we go she said yeah book so we booked Friday we on the air coming but before we at at the airport we said okay because we don't have any other money where do we sleep she remember there's another brother called brother Tim he stays in a in de8 or somewhere so we traced his number from the pastor from his church and he welcomed us he told us we are welcome so we came uh we came and our desire was just to attend the wedding maybe to buy a few Handbags and shoes and go back to our country that was all so what happened really when I when I reached the airport the airport that time was the old airport it was not renovated there was this certain rest and certain peace you know I I cannot explain it but I rested in my heart I've been to several other airports even bigger than what was that that but he didn't give me that and there was just a rest in my heart and I told Sarah Sarah we must come back here if God makes a way for us we must come back in the month of March that was sometime in November I told her March next year we shall come back so immediately after the airport we were driven to church and you know we just came with all the excitement and the happiness we're in a new country we are seeing Believers nothing in the mind really so when you just spoke I always say Amen if it's the word of God you just say Amen you receive yeah because you never know where God can meet you just say amen amen and actually that connects us to the Ethiopian people the Ethiopian people have never been in many countries I've never seen people that receive as the Ethiopian people when you speak when a prophetic utterance goes out or the word of God goes out or whatever an inspiration they will catch it amen they just say it with a lot of force and a lot of strength not like amen like weekly they would say it powerfully and well that then before you before before actually that wedding uh we just go back a little bit before that wedding in one of the services uh uh pastor morus at that time had um I think had already been voted in by the church as my associate uh in in the ministry in ad this Ababa and he he also used to be my interpreter so as I was preaching he was interpreting that someon that day and he said I said I was I was speaking on on uh Abraham and uh and um I was just talking about faith and then speaking on Abraham and how Abraham was uh you know told by God to sacrifice his only son and he did not have any hope for for another son but he believed God he just believed God and so what then happened is Abraham just went sacrificed his son but while he was going to kill his son you know the the voice of God spoke out of the thickets out of the sky and he he showed him in the thickets that he said Abraham do not kill your son for here is a lamb and you know he was told to take the lamb instead of his son to sacrifice him so when Abraham raised up his eyes and turned his head and there it was the sacrifice alarm in the thickets and so after the service that day uh uh Pastor moras came to me in the office and he said Hallelujah I said what is Hallelujah I said what is it he said my wife is somewhere and and she's serving God and she's a Believer because you see under no circumstance should unbeliever and she's a Believer and she's somewhere serving God and one day I will lift up my eyes and I will and I will turn my head and I will see her and I said amen you know I also learned to say Amen like the Ethiopians and so I don't know what was going what Revelation did you receive Pastor morus when you said that when after the preaching that day okay maybe Pastor to give a little testimony of myself before that is that um you know as I told you I grew in a family um a socialist family who really don't believe in God or something but believe in hard working and earning and um you know at school almost all grades from elementary up to uh high school or from two uh most of the time I used to I used to stand fast so I a lot of prices and of you know gifts from school so there's a saying that they used to tell us if you approach a girl or a woman you know you lose the vision so you won't make it in life so even before I came to the message that she would Ru your life yeah a woman you know actually later on I learned that that the prophet said there are three things that can ruin a man's life or Ministry number one is I mean one of them is women you see women so um so I used to fear you know before I met her or even before I believ the message I never kept a girlfriend my age is due but I never kept because there's a vision that I needed to attain which which we actually teach and believe yes that we don't believe in keeping girlfriends I believe this is what you're teaching also in your church yeah that's what I teach actually also uh then then now when I came to the message now of course like you are saying I had these things of now at no circumstance that a Believer should marry an unbeliever all those things he really you know when I came to the message I didn't come from different uh churchianity backgrounds I never knew Pentecostals I never knew other denominations even my own religion I only used to keep the the ring the on my neck the cross but I've never gone to church never knew anything so I'm just as I as I as raw as I was that time you see so when I believed um even when I believed the message itself I never knew the seals the church ages and all those Secrets what what tracked my heart is just acts chap 2:38 you know repent yeah you know when Brethren and you know what should we do you know they were pricked in their hearts yeah it pricked me because I found out you know Salvation without Jesus Christ there's no salvation so after I got saved now it's like you know you are writing on a a bear paper whatever you are saying that time it was sinking in my heart in my mind so uh you know when I heard those words of a Believer at no circumstan so I was always you know very conscious of those things so we were few as you said we are few in church and of course there also some sisters then at that time but uh I never uh you know I never told because also I had you know I have to continue my school you know do Masters do phds and all those then I used to think I I will get married after all these things are you know one of the things that this message converted me to is these things can be made you know marriage comes at his own time you know I was converted from that thought also then now uh uh of course we keep hearing the word in the church I was not like a lazy believer that time no every time I come I'm serious whatever is said from the church I go and read you know deepen myself in it because I come from the law school because I'm a reader you know I'm not just coming to church and going back and no I was not you know playing you know it was it was real life you know something real days in life so I took it at that capacity that's why until today when I preach I preach you know you know with fire and with fire and Zeal I don't want meaning I don't like lazy Believers by the way sorry the viewers laziness in the things of God how I really don't appreciate those so that time you know of course we also we had a good time because even the preached the prophet preached that if you're convinced you should be concerned concerned I'm not going to be lazy and relaxed used to now you know I I want to take also this opportunity to say uh it is your wife who saw a vision about me that time I never even used to know even about what is Vision what is prophecy what is prayer all these things I never grew in them so she saw it and she was telling you so I was being approached I was being pulled to the ministry that time so I also you added more that I should be very serious on these things of marriage so I begin to think about those things so it was in my heart that at no circumstance I should should marry an unbeliever and you see Pastor M as you continuing on that note we have a lot of young people in the church especially in the message not only here in our fellowship but in many fellowships around the world that do not actually listen to the councel of their pastors Pastor tells them and they do something else you advise them they do something else but in all my life I have never seen someone that really listen to everything like you yeah because you know I even used to reveal my secrets that time meaning there was a girl that uh we go to school but we never had anything but we just know one another when you grew in grew you know we just used to like communicate like that then I I came and told you there's a I mean a girl we are going to school like that you told me something that I should cut and cut I cut then when I told you that what did you think I you know that time whatever the pastor says I think it is God is saying yeah yeah that's how I take it when I go to church whatever it's being said it's God speaking so I hope young people you are listening I embrace that yeah so I Tred to keep myself even you remember I was very conscious of how to greet other sisters even in the church that time yeah yeah never approached a sister to laugh with or greet like that Pastor morus this generation younger people you tell them they don't listen they go there in their beds they whatsapping they whatsapping they whatsapping and they praying for God to give them the Bible tells us marriage is Honorable honorable and the B and defiled I don't encourage people to defile themselves yeah you know God is not happy you know the Bible Prophet preached a message that God cares do you care yeah know he preached God cares do you care for him you know he wants he expect you at some at some level you see especially this area of relationships so that time you know I used to say of course there are not enough sisters in the church we few about three four uh now I just I don't know I got that an inspiration from where what you preaching on that Abraham that I used to even tell other friends I will never marry but mine I know she is a believer of this message amen she may not be in this church yeah I know she's worshiping God somewhere somewhere that's like a l i mean a moto for me just a it's not a prophecy not inspiration but I'll just say it anyhow I'll get a one day yeah I'll get a one day and actually everybody knew you for that yeah yeah even actually some sisters came and uh uh for this one he somewhere he say he's somewhere but for us we are here no so I as I continued being ready for that marriage and also getting you know as a man you try to keep yourself like you know maintaining you know you just first of all you have to be a man a man like not necessarily materially or economically but you need to be a man properly you don't just wake up and move your appearance you know yeah you appear yourself you you know you have a a proper you know the hair in everything content they calling you you arrange yourself you look like a man responsible responsible so I kept doing that and you see of course that time when another family you know some some some younger men want to look like street gangs and then they they propose to Sisters they refuse them then they say Pastor the sisters are all saying no but the problem is with them no take care of yourself brother is it take care of yourself tell them yeah take care of yourself maintain yourself be responsible you know presentable not comparison but be yourself you see be yourself be humble and uh you know it's not the height it's not the weight it's not nothing you know what you are the character that is in you that attract the sister that time actually I like a this one she was well maintained she's working when had a confidence because I knew I don't that is now her but you God is going to begin another family he's going to raise it expand it multiply it bless it because God is in the in the economy of marriage amen not in the economy of the people behind because they have done their part they have raised the child and you also raised in a way you have ra but now when that happens there God begins to do his work and actually he would do things that he has never do to others amen you know people fear you know because of like you say you backround what they used to teach you how you and get messed up difficult so they have that fear many young men have that fear of even starting of even thinking about it think this testim yeah be yourself be yourself love God trust in God and and actually I have a that always even that the in the way which thou sh go your way the way that God preped for you only I will guide Thee I will guide thee with my eyes he will teach you how to do this even in the ministry even in cor life you may find people criticizing you you may find people despising you you may find different sorts of things but God had a way for you and in that way he will teach you and his eyes will be on the all the time amen so I had this verse in my entire life of this message actually after when after I came to this message I have this scripture whatever I do whatever God leads me to do I do it with all them I do it with all confidence I do it with all my capacity my strength so even that time of course I put uh all these things remember many know actually we know from the prophet Prophet wife whether you ethopian Africa Ghan or Uganda no problem as as talk about white and black you see so as long as she's not a wife and whether you are from Zab you are from Ghana from Uganda whatever it is you have the right as long as and you have prayed about it and you are L and God confirmed to you ask the prophet says different messes is in something will confirm to you in many ways confirm it so I had prayed then after when she came to for that weding I I never thought I would see her that time it was not my expectation but I was open for any leadership of I open I was prep I was I don't know whether from here or outs but whatever she is I be I'll be open I mean I'll be spected so that time she came that time I remember when they ared very for never and very for e e I e s how about now is it fine okay how is the sun now is is it all right is it all right they sound right now praise the Lord are we back on okay so we are really sorry we' been interrupted with some sound issue uh I don't really think it was a technical problem I think it's the devil try to us of issues so now we've been cut short in our time so we we're going to give it about 15 more minutes and then we will uh we'll break we'll break before maybe part B of the testimony if there is any it shall be another time but pastor you were just finalizing uh you were reading for us a scripture and finalizing on that bit so I think we'll just pick it up from there and then uh I always had that in My Mind and Spirit In My Soul so I was already although that time you see as a natural person as a natural man you ask that what do you have in your hands to to get married or to marry you know the people the you you have the car you have a house you have this and you have you all these things so I didn't fulfill that although fulfilling that is also good so uh when she came they came as a group from pastor's Church to attend the wedding they came we were in the wedding on Saturday she was there were all of us enjoing the weding she was jumping all of them all of us were jumping up joing the Lord and now Sunday also in the church now what really amazes me of the that which I was always saying as an inspiration or as any because life and days in the m i whatever I was saying God fulfilled it you see that's the point I want to raise here so Sunday Pastor wky was preaching and I was interpreting for him and the pastor really preached a masterpiece and people are really you know that time was a time really many of us uh you know having a time of reconciliation with the Lord you know a time of it was really the presence of God was too much and that service and then uh the pastor preached I guess he called you to the pulit and you led us through now in prayer more prayers then I was standing on the pulpit and you are praying I'm praying you led us to prayer to pray in ourselves and as we were praying I as I was interpreting I always was seeing her she was SE on the right hand where the sisters SE she was she was saying amen she was saying amen and amen as I interpreted through the service I I noticed her but now at that moment when you were leading us into prayer and we were all praying and I was closing my eyes all of them are closing their eyes were praying that presence of God was very too much and then I was meditating and like that and now you said something to the people when you said something to the people uh I had to interpret for you so I opened my eyes yeah I stood up like this and I begin to interpret for the people and lo and behold I saw her there in front of me by the way she was SE the other side very far away yeah and that statement that I used to say one day when I raise up like this I will see her then I saw her there I just kept quiet I maintained myself never said anything then that service ended we went home but but that moment that moment no something pricked me tell us what exactly happened cuz I have always told that testimony but I never knew what happened you know I was I was shocked you know kind of you know I was shocked kind of the way she also presented herself how she really you know wanted that touch from the Lord and she came to the Altar and when I opened and I saw her there like that sacrificial lamp you know like AB say she was just all over in tears yeah yeah she was also crying yeah something pred my heart and I maintained myself and service ended we went home now I didn't say any I I didn't realize it also we forgot and like a week later I came to you in the office I remember okay brother B Pastor what do you think what was that sister do you know her very well and uh do you know her where did she come from like I thought she came with her elder sister I thought that elder sister is her mother because she she's jumping up and down like you know you know I never and among all of them she looks different she looks ass yeah by the way all of them looked Kenyans but she looked Ethiopians yeah there were 15 out of 15 she never looked among one of them by the way so so that time I came to you ah you said ah you just SM and okay I don't know how also but um we shall um ask brother Paul you said but in that moment I had a time of greeting her I had a time of greeting her I had a time of greeting her but I never asked her her contact I never asked anything I never said anything to her yeah then you I think went ahead and so uh one thing that I really want to highlight light here is the way that really God does things all the way from Kenya how you did not want to come sister Mari during the wedding but somehow you know God puts everything in place and for you to come and then at the wedding that wedding of uh was a wedding of sister yodit you know I I I did the wedding but pastor Pastor wickly also came with the the rest of the group that came from Nairobi Pastor wickle is an elder and uh him to just you know um it was a big sacrifice as a pastor you have to also pray and be led of God who will Minister on your pull pit and so I I really labored on my heart and I felt because at that time Pastor mgus if you remember my pastor brother was there Pastor wickliff was there and other senior Brothers but I was specifically led to ask Pastor wickle to take that Sunday morning service and when that happened you know Pastor morus you tried to describe that atmosphere it was a real marvelous atmosphere s do you remember that time was a beautiful time was a beautiful time the presence of God was so real and we were blessing and and I and I remember when I um when I came I was speechless almost when I came on the pull pit and I did not have an interpreter because you were also messed up in the in the presence of God and I was messed up and everybody was messed up you know I love that mess of the presence of God because that's where the supernatural happens the supernatural takes place in that presence to you young people that are going to watch this or that are watching this right now want to tell you if you want a lifetime partner if you want a real wife a real husband you're going to find them in that presence not on WhatsApp and chitchatting and asking who is who and running after them and coming to church sometimes you run after them you are the one you are the one who knows every sister in the church you cannot find a wife like that it has to be in the presence of God In Prayer when God gives you Revelation you're not going to be trying and you know try how do they call it try and error try and error you try and then doesn't work out okay I'll go to another one you try doesn't work out you go to another you try it is not going to be like that the story will be different when you are in that presence God will give you like he gave Pastor moras oh that testimony just finishes me he always said it remember he has the scripture he quoted for us is in Proverbs 1821 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof yes sir and he has his fruit here the fruit of his tongue so if you you say life you will have life if you say I will never marry you will never marry if you say in our family it doesn't happen that way it will never happen you have if you say I'll marry in 10 years that is how it will be but if you say I'm going to marry this year some of you are watching this testimony are going to marry this year if you believe it amen Pastor marus is going to pray for you before he leaves here you are going to receive the same anointing and God will give you Grace to marry this year amen and and if you say it you believe it so shall it be amen and he said it he believed it and at that moment when um uh when the sister came she was messed up the uh brother was messed up and uh and and and now and now he he looked turned his head and he saw her right there just like he had said it you say what is going to happen in your life is going to be exactly like how you prophesied over yourself and so you you you are you are now talking about um so you came to my office and then we we talked it over I also did not know the sister but then the other significant part is you did not take the sister's contact you could have asked it you were a very confident man but you did not why you see I as I told you I always wanted to go as per the ways of God you see at that time God put you there I came to that office I told you and you went ahead and actually I remember even after even you had to find out who the sister is I thought maybe she's a school girl or something but when we asked brother Paul brother Paul said no the sister is not a school girl actually she works you know she's working so so you had then he actually gave us some more background information he said she has been working for over 10 years yeah you see not because she was since she from uh from grade 10 I think she continued to school and work contined school and work together so so um Paul when he gave the information he he told you uh I think he told you to give the contact to you then it is you who gave a contact to me I never asked her yeah it's me or you I I got it someone someone has a more information on that yeah how did he get the contact yeah after praying reading whatever you gave him then you allowed I actually did not have the contact my wife is the one who had the contact I remember the first thing I told you remember the first thing I told you to do read this uh of you know the courtship uh book cour yeah brother Beck is who put that together 100 pages in two nights I finished it because yeah I didn't sleep I remember I used to live in back of you know somewhere you remember how I used to pray every morning this is your will yeah brother and sister this I want to I I just want to inject some word here some inspiration or some thoughts tell them before you decide because marriage we always preach or we always say say once you enter into there is no way out hey there's no trying and coming back out so you marry someone whom you loved you marry someone whom the Lord has confirmed to you you marry someone who you have confidence in you marry you don't marry family you marry the sister you don't marry to the things that are surrounding her you marry character in her actually another Pastor put it this way you marry the character of Christ in her she's a raw material you make her to what you want to be after you grow together yeah okay I wanted to say something about M's life I wish all young people can be like him he didn't give okay like a hard time this morus was someone who could take the word of God serious whenever he was told something he really put it in in in action and he worked upon it it was really working in his life even that one gave me a great burden to pray for M because he was a special brother I wish all of you can take what your pastors teach you for sure yeah that's all amen and from that I I got her contact I told her the first statement said God bless you my sister we I I hope you enjoyed Among Us uh we thank God we had a good time in the presence of the Lord that's I thought wait a moment this is a good moment now young people listen this is not the best moment now it's the climax now okay so you get the contact of sister M after now everything from your side goad my side is settled I've given you a go ahead now you've got you said you go ahead and communicate with her because sincerely as a pastor I cannot talk to the girl on your behalf yeah at that time you had to talk you know some I was I was about not to say it but let me say it some pastors speak on behalf of the boys go to the girls and speak on their behalf but we don't believe in that we believe that we don't believe in matchmaking we believe that a boy has to speak for himself and so we we find that uh when you go to the girl and uh that moment I'm sure the young people watching they will want to know the words you use me I thought you began like this you know I love you so much I'm thinking about you ever since you left here no no no no we even have it still I think she the the chats we had after that about how many pages 600 Pages we we charted about about 600 Pages we charted my God she counted it you have it yeah but the first text I sent her yes God bless you my sister yes thank you for coming to Ethiopia and I hope you enjoy it and we also from this end we really enjoyed being with you the presence of God how did you find it that's an opening remark now now there is some other significant thing here so sister M now that's where when you come in again mhm when you received this text the moment you saw it what came to your mind the microphone I think before the message came in uh after we left from the wedding what there's one thing that striked me apart from the testimony he gave about what was happening on the presence of God at the altar um during the wedding during the cake ceremony the because the were sisters were few so brothers and sisters were serving all the guest kicks so morus and another brother called brother idck and another one came with kicks where the Kenyans were so as they serving us kicks Mor started giving us his testimony of how he met the Lord and how the Lord called him from Orthodox religion and how God dealt with him and converted them how he's embraced this message how he was able to sacrifice everything him being a lawyer a potential judge in Ethiopia you know everybody wants this top top position like what we fight for in Kenya and this young man just he did not count it anything he's really like Moses actually his name is mes but it's really Moses in English just like Moses forsook the pleasures of Egypt to be counted with the children of God is exactly what he did that one really strike me so after that service when Pastor wickly was preaching I was actually telling the Lord Lord if somebody can really Embrace this message so much and sacrifice for you even their very life their very own life counting your Treasures of this message as the best Treasures that he can have Lord give me a faith like that because that time in my country I was already working and right there in the youth meetings which just ended pastor morus preached on esteeming the reproach of Christ esteeming the reproach I believe every young person should look that up my my it was a masterpiece so that one really caught me so we we traveled back home and everything no contacts and anything I'm not thinking about anything but now one in the service in around December Pastor wkly was preaching and I'm listening the service and just morus passes I don't know to call it a TR or and I was not thinking about it but remember I used to have fervent prayers before the Lord concerning my marriage because I didn't want to take a wrong route and I told the Lord Lord I know if I can just lean on your arm surely you'll not let me down even I told the Lord one word we use in procurement because I'm a procurement specialist I told him Lord I will let you do the due diligence for me you know due diligence is you know you know that person you know what is in their heart what is in their soul what is around them how they grew who their families are you know like it's you do the I told the Lord you'll do diligence for me for the brother that you want to bless me with so that was my prayer and now when when I saw him in a or was it a vision I don't know so just there I found myself saying Lord if there's anything to eat you know my number you know where I sit in church you know the roads I go to you know my email address you can find me anywhere and I left it at that the next Monday the next Monday at 4:30 the message comes to my phone greetings and it shocked me did you not faint it shocked me because I just connected it to the to the what I said yesterday in the church okay I responded just greetings normally we had a good time also the Lord was so gracious ethopia what God is doing let him continue and that was it now would it be correct to say that the moment you received that message you were 70% sure that brother morgus was your husband actually I was almost nearing 100 nearly only the only because I was in prayer Pastor all this time in fact I used to pray at 3:00 a.m. every morning and my sisters would come in the salon I would leave them in the room I go to the salon alone in a small M and I would really pray before the Lord and um my sister one day she was just passing to go to the washrooms and she passed by and say Lord whatever this girl is praying for just give her give her we are tired if it's a husband give her whatever she wants just give her was my big sister sister s what do you have and I think I saw Sarah following on on on YouTube so God bless you Sister Sarah Mor we are so happy I know she has a wedding soon she has a wedding soon yes so now Sister Mary tell the young people following what would you tell them about this matter because you received a text uh from brother morus at the time and you knew already you were almost 100% because you you you were praying you the whole thing was a spiritual thing it was a spiritual Affair so for me it was so Supernatural by the way what do you advise these young people and before you advise them I want to ask you a question were you having other brothers you were now texting back and forth with tell us confess today sister M uh for me no that I didn't have any other brothers that I was texting actually when I went to the Church of Pastor wickliff there's a brother that I used to like so so much but it was my own doing I used to like him so much but on the opposite side he was not liking me back and it used to make me feel so bad so but God was so faithful because when you put something before him he will answer yeah he would tell me every day either in a dream or in the Bible That's not the one for you I have the one for you he's not the one for you and I would fight with God why wouldn't you change his heart you are the god you can change this is the one I want yeah and God would tell me that's not the one it was a desire but God had not sanctioned he didn't sanction and he would tell me when he' show me in dreams he's not the one so in other words we believe that God can actually speak to you about your lifetime partner correct God is faithful you're his child and so what do you speak to them who are listening that are actually right now chitchatting with three four of them at the same time Just Surrender the day I surrendered the lord gave me that song called um you whatever it be whatever it be thy will is th is mine whatever it be thy hand Divine sustain me amen thy will let your will be mine whatever it be the day the lord gave me that song that was it I surrendered I told God from today Take the Lead whatever you choose that's what I'll take even if he lives in a box house you know the prophet talks about a box house yeah box house yes a box a Caron house yeah I told the Lord even if you want me to go and you give me my my Adam who lives in a box house with nothing I will say yes and I will go and friends you need to understand that this is somebody who was already working uh in a a very in a multinational company actually uh earning good salary having own property and doing quite well not so bad and so but she was willing to follow the will and the mind of God now if you are looking for a lifetime partner you must be willing to follow the mind of God not your will but the mind of God the will of God because God speaks if we are talking about a living God Pastor M preaching about a living God the the other day if we're talking about a living God is not dead He's Alive And if you you desire to meet him on any matter in your life he will show himself to you because he's not dead he's alive he's a living God him that did it for them can and for us as well we only we also have our own testimony he that did it for them and us can do it for you because he's a living God he's not dead we sing a song Our God is not dead he is alive and so sister if you're chatting with three four brothers five 6 10 no you are doing a big mistake marage is not like that marriage is not like that just tell them yeah so I want what I would just want to add finally is that um okay after choosing then the rest the procedures I took it you know as per the code and conduct of the mage message you go to your pastor and we the pastor will assist you and we went to Kenya you remember that time we went to Kenya with you and uh and went to Pastor WK Pastor I just want to take this opportunity also to appreciate Pastor WK when we reached there he never despised us or he never said anything he just said okay for me it's okay but you go and finish with a parent so even gave us some deons from the church like pastor brother in boa that time we went there the family received us they never gave us a lot of trouble so we were at good then everything went right and even the wedding when reached the wedding some brethren um some brethren followed us uh you know supported us you know all through uh followed us and until today Brothers like um salamu brother brothers like a Brothers like Abbe Brothers like and the rest followed us and supported us and still these brothers the names I'm mentioning they are laboring in the kingdom of God with us so the wedding went on well and everything because when Once something once God is in something he will accomplish it he will be with you he will support you he he will make a way where there's no way he will raise people and I and I remember and I remember before you actually met Pastor wickliff my wife and I was going through Nairobi we actually took a a Night Flight there yeah we arrived and met him reminded me that and uh I had to be I to be a John Baptist Baptist God used you mightily and mightily and mightily that's why even the other day here I I gave a testimony what you stood for me that time I will not forget it my generation will not forget it even the next so I am so grateful God raed you my life in he and also your wife and and I always appreciate her uh that she took she took me as a child she fed me she saw something great in me which I didn't know and others didn't see so and so when we met the pastor wck he was very gracious he was a kind man he received us and also this goes to show the young people you see Pastor morgus you're now a pastor and you are leading not only one Fellowship but very many churches in Ethiopia and the Lord teres and you know there will be very many by thousands of Believers and I'm sure that many of them will see this testimony in the in the coming years if the Lord T but this is not only for them but for us here and for our young people here and for whoever that God will allow this testimony to get to our Prophet says that uh the man of God that he raises in your life is your pastor give him respects sure and he says that he will lead you through you see but many people young people when they want to start marriage they are by pass bypassing their Pastor no no no you get the blessing of your pastor let him bless it let him see also because you are also taught yeah you know if the sister is in the church and the brother is in the church the pastor should know the status of the sister yeah you first come to the pastor yeah the pastor knows her status yes whether she is already you know in on the process of another person yes or not uh or not and he would tell you when you reached Pastor W and we asked him he said the sister is good good yeah as far as I know there's no one who is talking to her yeah so you go ahead yeah you see if you just go to the sister so you had now the blessing of her pastor yeah the pastor has given you he said she's faithful she's good girl she's good she's she's you know he will tell you about her faith about also her a character I mean he would tell you about her he said the family is good the sister is good so you go ahead you see if you just go to direct by passing the pastor maybe that sister is maybe on the process of engaging another brother which the the church knows and you are making what this this what do you call adulter or something you are making something wrong you see you are you are doing you know you are making her mind also to and and many of them you know many of them approach it kindly you know you see because you see if this brother comes this brother is maybe driving a very good car and he's well off and this brother is just starting out in life and the sister is put in a situation where she has to compare who should I choose no no all these things as I told you when okay I want to say these things she was much better than I in life at that time when I found her later but when I saw her first I never knew any of that as I told you I thought she's a school girl yeah yeah I always said it even that time yes even when we communicate by the way she used to when you send sometimes after everything the church pastor and this side known we used to communicate every morning so she used to we used to call each other video call then she hides those Vehicles she's driving she didn't want me to be stumbled I never knew by the way I never think things and I never married these things and I I saw Christ in her I even from that time by let me tell you this as a final from that time it's about six years now we never Ser you have never quarreled praise the Lord misj here and there happens what about slapping how many times have you slapped zero and minus zero yeah never Hallelujah that oh my well I've been married 11 years and I've never slapped her praise the name of the Lord hallelujah what I want to tell you here is that our home is always peaceful yeah when you have misunderstandings little little in little me God the way God created me I don't when somebody's on fire I don't want to add more fire yeah I leave it and go to the bedroom or I calm it down that's even I use it as a Doctrine in the church to preach when something happens and you are maybe hot don't you know fire up you know it will create other things calm down calm down calm down so in our home yeah never and I'm telling I'm saying this in the name of the Lord yeah never qu quarreled yeah our home is at some misunderstanding here that is normal in relationship we sit down this one happens this and this especially now because me I'm ethopian she's a Kenyan so there may be some difference on food you know how to receive welcome you know this and that then we always speak and set out things and we're happily living together Pastor moras sister mgas I I wish we would really continue but uh unless I'm going to buy you another ticket uh so we have to really Rush right now and go to the airport and uh and if we miss our flight sister morus you will have to buy another ticket by yourself so but anyways I know sister morus has something to say before before we go I would wish to really encourage the sisters and tell them always the Lord works both ways in any marriage the Lord works both ways he cannot confirm to morus that I'm his wife and he doesn't confirm to me so when he sent me that message greeting me in my spirit I knew but I told the Lord you must confirm I must be sure because I want to know that I'm walking in the path of your will for my life so I prayed on later for another two weeks I think two weeks almost and uh as we continue talking as we continue talking when he proposed marriage to me that he wants to come and ask my mother for my hand in marriage I was in the office he just sent me a text he wants to come and see my mother and ask for my hand that is the day my stomach went and I told my boss I need to leave just now I'm suddenly sick and I need to leave I went straight home in my room locked locked I prayed until three I told Lord you must confirm to me today what is this I'm stepping into what is all this that is going on this conversations with this brother I want to know if it is your will let it be if it's not take it away amen I wasn't interested in joking amen that was like I think after we spoke for almost I think a month or so yeah but remember yeah no no just said he had finished her I finished her no Al she finished yeah she must have finished your because oh my God she was all over your mind remember that time we were together with you how I used to tell you I have a burden for Kenya yeah this time you you had a burden to go to Kenya to serve God but I don't know what kind of serving God was this pastor I actually think he got finished on Friday when I was walking in with the suitcases I think that's when he got finished he'll tell us the backside of the story yeah so so I prayed until about 7:00 the Lord was silent he's not saying anything I got tired of praying I took my Bible I couldn't get any Scripture that was ministering to me then I opened one message I'm telling you this message has the answer for everything young people don't look for Google answers Google is not your father your father is in the message the Lord Jesus Christ he has answers for everything so I just opened one just the way you open like this and there was my quotation in one message called I will restore God clearly said go ahead this is my blessing for you I have come to kiss you on the cheek it is there in one of the messages in I will restore to tell you go ahead and I close that chapter chapter and the next day I called my mother I didn't even involve anyone because I wanted first to know it is the Lord then from there let me tell my mother when I call my mother the second day I tell her okay mom there's something happening there's this brother from ethopia my mom just tells me H so it is you and I tell her what kind of answer is that so it is you yeah you're the one God showed me last year in 2016 God showed me some funny kind of people they look like so they were singing around my house like this coming to take my girls so as December was approaching she started asking the Lord Lord did you show me a dream which is not true and remember I came in November here December from December 13th already M has already started talking to me but me I don't have confirmation from the Lord I'm not saying anything my confirmation came 7th of January 6th of January so I called her on the 7th I told her mom she told me so it is you she told me how is I said he's a minister he preaches he interprets the message he told me Mary let me tell you one thing if he's a Son of God it is enough he just needs to be a Son of God and and and he didn't tell me to ask him anything or don't ask him where he stays don't ask for it if he is a Son of God it is enough the rest will and and I remember one thing that I really also want to highlight here when we came to visit her when we came to her she did not make anything complicated she stood with us she actually you know of course your father's is is is late now but all your unles were available but she she stood almost as a man in the home and she said uh she told all the uncles you know of course here in Africa we know that we have to pay a lot of bright price but she said what I asked for what I know my son can afford is what Only We Shall require him to pay nothing else nothing more now in Africa here especially here in Black I know ethopians you don't think you're in Africa but here in Africa that to to us is an embarrassment if you don't bring a lot of cows but to any civilized especially spiritually civilized society they know it's not how many things a man brings it's what kind of a man is taking someone's daughter and that's even why brother bham did not ask for cows but what did he ask for he said if you have the Holy Ghost to George Smith if you have the Holy Ghost that's all you need to take my daughter and so that also goes to parents I think you know if we we make life hard for the young people starting out in life how do you expect them to to to live a life to to get married and to to give you grandchildren how do you expect them to serve the Lord we have not to make it complicated for them but we instead have to support them instead we have to support them with prayers we have to encourage them we have to support them with our resources to help them start out in life and now because their mother your mother supported you and you know stood behind you the whole thing became a success we we really uh wish we have a lot to say and my wife was saying something do you remember what you wanted to say you were saying that they followed uh they followed councel and you wanted to say something on that do you still want to wanted to say they followed C whenever they canell like they didn't like talk in the night many things no six is six or eight yeah no communication these days my idea I don't know what is happen to our generation but I really trust that this testimony is going to impact someone's life and that God will help you to just follow not only councel but follow the right procedures listen to your pastor and I'm sure according to what the prophet said he will lead you through Pastor mgus I'm sure if we can tell you to preach a seron now you will go an hour but our flight is done you need to pray for the young people listening yeah let me just pray in one minute many of them want to get married many of them are praying many of them have done a lot of mess we need God to give them Grace we need God to uh straighten them out and make it happen for them this year sure and uh just want to say this and I pray actually in our marriage was uh seen by many and many supernational things really I was God raised many people many Believers many Elders many stood with us and it was an international wedding from Kenya and none of my blood family stood with me except my mother my brother you remember I come from a very big family so but now one thing reminded me that her father her late father saw a dream that one of his daughters would go would marry outside of the country who uh that man who is getting married uh who get that man his father would have a very large maze farm and exactly that happened in my family my father owns a very large farm of maze so all these things these testimonies or these Visions make it now to come to pass you know so we really appreciate um uh the Believers the elders whoever stood with us at that time and by their prayers by their support and we are still here and we've had the six years of marriage together in peace and God has been with us and he's teaching us standing and guiding us and we appreciate that and we are also she came and she stood with me and ups and downs you know when she come deciding she will be with you she will never complain she will never correl you see and to the sisters what I would say pray so that God will reveal to you don't move around to the brothers looking close your eyes and pray just like Adam when he wake up he saw her he saw he never said whether he never asked tall girl short one big one slim one no no no no this physical things let God give you the way he wants to be amen Adam never said all these things amen this generation you know you know she has to be maybe tall slim like that like this all those criterias even God does not create that way yeah yeah you just you just find your rib amen find his amen you see so the way she's made she's perfect for me amen perfectly amen beautiful you are satisfied satisfi 100% I love her with all my heart praise the name of the Lord yeah so Hallelujah let's get into that inspiration Amen to the young Brothers what I would advise be yourself never compete yeah that's a very good never compete yeah never say I would marry from a city or from the village no no no no no no some people come from the The Village they in the city but Village never comes out of them you see yeah so don't see physical matters see character yes in a sister in a sister yes then God will mold you you together with her we be molded towards that perfect St of Christ amen so I just want to pray so before you pray I'll just maybe for the viewers who have been viewing you do not know uh but uh Pastor moras is the pastor in Adis saaba uh Ethiopia if you happen to be there please please contact him uh if you don't have his contact you can contact us we'll be able to connect you he's a pastor there and sister Mery is a very good pastor's wife and uh whenever I travel there theyve been a blessing to us so the church Day pastor we started it with my wife along with others who supported us many of them and and when time came for us to leave Ethiopia uh God raised him uh ministering him to take over that work and now he has expanded it even to other areas areas God is using him mightly and I say to you young man who has been listening to us if your marriage is has gone right even your life will go right career- wise and many other ways so uh our time is really fast spent we need to go and I'll ask Pastor mgas to bless you okay let's pray father in the name of Jesus Christ and we know we are living in this last age where everything is L much under merchandised Mary meaning became you know like a trade we are living in a NE neurotic age where many things are not right and the god that serves this age is an evil that's why the prophet would preach a God of this evil age many are being deceived Lord but us who are called by his name who are known before the foundation of the world we go according to the leadership of the Holy Spirit and Jesus Christ thank you for for giving us this time father these young men especially who was in this message Father may you help them strengthen and guide them for them to see or look the supernatural ways of how God does things on how they can find their partner or father to to go after that perfect will of God to seek Him day and night diligently Lord for him to lead them for him to bring her wherever she is wherever she is is God in his own ways will bring them together Lord let them wait or father them who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strengths we know that scripture Lord oh Father help them oh Father may they not fall by the by the desires of the flesh protect and give them their Holiness of father to serve you better we commit young ones we commit the elderly ones all of them and marriage we know through marriage Society established through marriage country established through marriage a church established or father the devil is against marriage the devil is not happy about marriage and he knows the best Sal the best gift after salvation is marriage he wants to destroy that marriage now once the marriage that area is spoiled our life would have scar so we don't want to have a scar in our life we want to protective we want to be sensitive to the leaders of the Holy Spirit we want to kill our flesh we want to overcome the desires of our flesh we want to overcome our five senses physical senses we want to only look up to you look unto you for you will guide us father you will bring to them you will connect them from wherever they are father we commit them or father out of this testimony many holy
