We have no membership but just fellowship. We are not perfect in our own selves, [Music] but the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us of all our sins. So we are Bible believers. Amen. Amen. pastor is not with us today is at to serve the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us open our Bibles. First John chapter 4, we read verse 1 to6. Amen. Amen. Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God, because many false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God. And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of Antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come, and even now already is it in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. So the one that overcomes is the one that's on the inside. Not one that is, you know, but the overcomer is on the inside. He says that greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. They that are of the world, they are of the world. Therefore speak they of the world, and the world hearth them. &gt;&gt; We are of God. He that knows God hears us. &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is no pressure there is no worry but he that is he that is of he that knows God hears us. He that is not of God he has not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. &gt;&gt; Amen. I read. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can interpret. for forcib. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Kindly take your seats. Shall we bow our heads and pray? Dear God, We have read out of your word. We know that your word is true and the Holy Spirit is the witness that comes to confirm it to be alive. Let it discern the secrets of the heart and minister to the needs of your people. Dear God, take the word. Break it yourself. Let it be real. Let it be life. Let it transform lives. Let it help these people myself and my brother to come closer to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Help us Lord in Jesus Christ name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God richly bless you once again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not going to be too long. &gt;&gt; We want to go beyond one and a half hours. Amen. Amen. Uh today I want to talk about believe not every spirit. Believe not every spirit. The Bible here has said that beloved that is this is the John uh it says beloved he's talking to believers he says believe not every spirit don't just believe every spirit but try the spirit whether they are of God because many false prophets are born out into the world. It says in other words each is each false prophet or each prophet carries a certain spirit. So he says there are too many and they are false going out into the world. He says don't just believe. But try the spirit whether they are of God and don't just judge before you try the spirit. Don't just condemn. He says but try the spirit whether they are of God. Hereby know you the spirit of God. Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ as is come in the flesh that is of God. The simplicity which is in Christ, &gt;&gt; the word of God is not a complex and the spirit of God is not complicated. It is the people that build up a complex and get complex. and and and and and get into and get complicated. It says every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God. And this is that spirit [Applause] of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come. And even now already it is in the world. Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them [Applause] because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. In other words, he says, "Many have gone out in the world, but you have someone greater that's in you that is greater than them that is gone out." He says, "These false prophets, they are of the world. Therefore, they speak of the world. Even their speech is limited unto the things of the world and the world hears them. It's not a surprise. It's not a surprise that they have a lot of following. It says because they are of the world, they speak of the world. Therefore, the world has got to hear them. We are of God can hear us. He that knows God hears us. He that is not of God, hears not us. Hereby know with the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. As simple as that. Amen. It says that's how we know the spirit of God. Yes. The other is a spirit of error brother and sisters. We know or we must know or let us know that whatsoever words that man speaks and whatsoever deeds that a man does. They are influenced and inspired and moved by a certain spirit. It's a matter of spirit. [Applause] There is a spirit behind every deed. There is a spirit behind every word and that spirit is the one that we must try. Now listen, before you can speak anything, it comes from a certain spirit. [Applause] Whatever you speak, &gt;&gt; whatever you hear, &gt;&gt; whatever you speak, whatever you hear, it is from a certain spirit and your speaking and your doing is a clear sign that you believed a certain spirit. Paul said, "Even so we have believed therefore we speak. Therefore, whatever you speak, whatever you hear, whatever you do, it's under a spirit." But God says, &gt;&gt; "Be careful, brother. Be careful, sister. &gt;&gt; Don't just believe everything." [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a matter of spirits because it's a spiritual warfare. We do not fight flesh and blood, but we are fighting powers of darkness, [Applause] rulers of high places and prosperities, [Applause] demons, a bunch of them that's been released out. We have come to the climax of the ages. It's a climax of all demons. Coming to a shutdown, coming to a showdown. The devil releasing out all hell upon the peoples of the world. So it is a climax of the edge. protects all the devils spirit that spirit through all the seven chapters. It's a climax that he pours out. All of the spirits that's in the seals, all the spirits that is in the seals, it's been all poured out. So we must encounter all these devils with discernment. &gt;&gt; Listen brother, ask yourself what you have spoken, what you have done, whatever I speak, whatever I do, sit back, ask yourself, &gt;&gt; what spirit led me? It says led of the spirit. So it is a spirit. It is every man has got to be led by a spirit. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of this evil age, &gt;&gt; he says, "Has God lost control?" Has God lost control? It's a question. Do you think that God has lost control? Uh, paragraph 55. Just stay with me just a short while. He says, "Has God lost control?" Or is is he just permitting another agent to control? I wonder God is no longer having control or has allowed another power to rule. I wonder the true answer to this question is to my opinion there is two opposing spirits in the world today. You know the contest between God and Satan says there's two opposing spirits in the world today. And if this spirits are contending, you have to be contending for something. They are contending for your soul. And they in the world today and they are at work. There can't be no more than two. There can't be no more than two heads. [Applause] All right. And one of them is the Holy Spirit who is at work. The other one is a spirit of the devil. And in this last days, in deception, he says, "In the last days, the spirit of the devil is working in deception. I am going to bless my thoughts right on there for the rest of the text. The two spirits, one of them, God is Holy Spirit. The other one, the devil's spirit walking in deception. The people of the earth are now making their choice. Brother, this spirit say you make a choice. You allow the spirit to control you. The Holy Spirit is here calling out the bride for Christ. He is doing it by vindicating his word of the promise to her. This is the edge showing that it is a Christ. If the finger is supposed to move in this age, if the finger &gt;&gt; Yes, the finger will move. If the foot is supposed to move, the foot will move. If the eye is to see in this age, the eye will see. The spirit of God as it is grow out into the full stage of God is the age that now we are living in. Amen. Amen. My has gone off. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It says &gt;&gt; uh the devil's unholy spirit. The devil, &gt;&gt; the devil's unholy spirit is here calling his church by the error as usual by perversion of the word of God like he did at the beginning. See it coming right back to that seed time again. [Applause] So he's talking about the two spirits, [Applause] the two powers that is in the world today trying to control the world. And he says one is of the Holy Spirit, another one is the unholy spirit. Then he says &gt;&gt; in the revelation of Jesus Christ in the church ages. Now remember this. Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts. Just stay with me. Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of acts. But the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist would come into the church. Now I'm not talking about the church as DVF as as a church. days of the I'm not talking about the entire bride of Christ. I'm talking about you as an individual. It shows that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making you lukewarm for. It exposes Satan revealing his works attempted destruction of God's people and discrediting of God's word [Applause] right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire. He fights that. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that if the people get the true revelation, you you you yourself. If you get the true revelation of who you are, it says of the true church and what she is and what you are she stands for and what you can do. No matter works, you will be an invisible army. If you if you get the true refresh of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian and by God's spirit, the son will stand. the antichrist spirit. Satan will be blessed before you. He will be as definitely thwarted as when Christ withtood his every brother. If you by God is spirit and with stand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before you. While the devil has a power before you, you have no discernment of spirits. You have no discernment of spirits. Why often times we regret, oh, I wish how did I do that? How did I do that? &gt;&gt; You did discern the spirits. Oh, I wish I didn't say that. It's about discernment, brother. Listen, brother, sister, we are not going to jump around today. We want you to be sober. We want you to be vigilant. That's when we shall see works of God. You will always conceive. You will always conceive what you believe. The results will come because of what you believe. [Applause] Because of what you receive, because of what you accept. That's what will bring forth results. So we want you to stay still. We want you to wait a little until you are certain that this is God. Listen brother before he can say that we are trying the spirit. First we must be certain by what spirit are we trying the other spirit by I'm discerning the spirit I'm trying I'm trying the spirit by what spirit are you using to try the other spirit because listen first John 4:4 says we have got little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world. And the prophet says by God is the spirit discern the spirit of antichrist. So by what spirit? By what spirit are you using to discern or to try? Yes. For because if we put the spirit of God to a test by the word and we ourselves have not the spirit of God, we are going to condemn the truth. Listen brother, I'm saying if you have a wrong spirit and you take the word to try to try another spirit, trust me, you are going to condemn the spirit of God. Listen brother, Jesus Christ said the Pharisees and the Sadducees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses. Therefore, whatever they beat you to do, do it because they they are the official interpreters. They have got to do that job. They take the scripture that Jesus Christ said, &gt;&gt; but them themselves they are of the devil. When the word was put before them to try Jesus and Jesus was put into a trial, they got the scripture. The Pharisees and they tried to the word. They took the scripture to try the spirit which was working in Jesus because they had the wrong spirit but the right scripture. They condemned the Lord of glory because they used the wrong spirit to try the spirit of God. Listen brother, I'm saying if we put the spirit of God to a test by the word and we ourselves have not the spirit of God. We are going to condemn the truth and say and say and we shall say it ought to be this way or that way. Listen, if we are to try the spirits, I want you to listen carefully. If we are to try their spirits, &gt;&gt; we must we must to I want you to keep this in your heart, in your inner man. If we are to try the spirits, we must start with the one in us. Start with the spirit in you. that one first. If you have a wrong spirit, it is impossible for you to judge the spirit of God and say it is true. Amen. You can't. If we have the spirit of God, if you have the spirit of God, then you will judge well and testify that the testimony is true and you will judge the spirit of Satan that it is wrong. Amen. I give you a clear example. If a minister stands here or you somewhere you are listening and is ministering the word or if a sister stands before you brother and you want to try you say you're trying the spirit and now you you you you want to try the spirit. He said it's brother Martin brother Julius I have to try this spirit first ask yourself now he it stands with a testimony &gt;&gt; that I have the Holy Spirit listen brother sister no matter the confession of anyone you have a right a god-given right not to believe their confession their testimony until you have tried it. You have that right and the conclusion you make after that will determine of what spirit you are also. So you start with yourself [Applause] try first the spirit and you find out Because the spirit the things of God no man knows. First Corinthians 2:9 to 16. They are known of God. They are searched by the spirit of God and the spirit of God himself. Know the deep things of God. And who has known the mind of God. that he should guide the Lord, that he should cancel him. So a natural man knows not the things of God, but the things of God cannot be discerned. My brother, I come to realize that the problems we are having today in our families, &gt;&gt; in our churches, wherever we go, it's because we are trying to judge the spirits without using the spirit of God. We are trying to judge the spirits when we ourselves are minded. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the cause of this the result of this it brings shame, blasphemy and people acting out of place and get to think they are right when yet they are wrong. and built a complex around themselves thinking that they desend well. But yet the problem is they are inspired by wrong spirit leading them into a complex. Listen brother, the things of God are not discerned. The natural man doesn't know the things of God. Amen. He cannot brother. It says &gt;&gt; uh paragraph 16. Just stay with me. Just stay with me. All right. And I thought comparing the deer with a man that'sing thirsting for God. Before the enemy gets there, about a child of God, there is something about the child of God that when you once are born into the spirit of God, when you are once &gt;&gt; when When you once are born into the spirit of God and receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit, there is something about the person that can sense the enemy. You can take a man when he's taking the scripture and reading the scripture. and he try to inject something to that scripture [Applause] and injecting something contrary to the scripture. A man that's filled with the Holy Ghost can sense that right now. He's talking about a spiritual man, one that's born of God. He says they have a spiritual sense. They can sense the enemy right now. There is they can sense right quick that there is something out of the way when he gets into a place and that little certain sense in there that is done to protect your life. the sense in the Holy Spirit. It is only the Holy Spirit that can catch that has that sense which catches the lies of the enemy. Amen. It's not in the natural man. It's it's it's the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know the brother said, "Brother, &gt;&gt; my wife has a wrong spirit. I've tried to cast it out, but it's still there." He told him go buy the chocolate take it to your wife. In other words, you're doing it in a wrong way. His thinking is right with the word cast. But doesn't work that way. He said you are doing it wrong. He didn't have enough discernment. There was something just a little chocolate could take. It was not the chocolate. It was not the chocolate but an expression of love. Just go and express love. Now listen brother, what am I trying to mean? What I'm trying to show you is often times you fail to get results. and what you are trying to overcome or what you think you should overcome or whom you think you should help because to begin with you are doing it in a wrong way is influenced by a wrong spirit. The devil can play both of you in your spirituality. He can make you to get uh to to to you know says if the devil cannot take you out from it. He will make you go overboard. So the devil will make you go overboard and he'll get both of you defeated. &gt;&gt; Then so he says enticing spirits &gt;&gt; I just have a lot of quotes here not too much jumping around and things we just want to learn. It says power. So the the Bible has told us that we must try the spirits before we can judge them whether these spirits are of God. So he says now today so many people are listening. Look &gt;&gt; so many people are listening to enticing spirits. [Applause] Instead of taking the word of God, it says spirits they are in the world they are demons. and they go out into places and get amongst men. &gt;&gt; Listen, ministers, they get amongst church members. They get amongst good people and they cause them to come into a illusion. And they say things and you do things and you touch things and practice things and practice things as contract things contrary to the Spirits in the world believe not every spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, it says they are there in the world. And in Matthew 24, he says verse four, and Jesus answered and said unto them, we just we just go here. Take heed that no man deceive you. Don't just believe. Every minister, don't just believe. Every brother, every sister, I had a dream. I say vision and daughter try the spirit of God. Everybody says, &gt;&gt; "I'm tired of these prophets that say, I had a dream. I had a dream. &gt;&gt; I'm tired of the prophets. I had a dream." Brother, it has got to be first tried. If it is not matching with the script, no matter how good your dream is, it's wrong. Amen. The brother come to brother. The dream looked nice. The wife went into adultery and another man and another man and another man. Then she came back to him and he took her in and he was a minister and he said I had a dream and this a dream. She came to me and this and that. He said, "Brother, you are sincere. Your dream is of the devil, but it looked nice." It looked like it is it is preaching forgiveness, but it was to the scripture, no matter how tender you come, how lovely you come, you may be a sheep in You know brother, it's not about the tenderness, not about the loveliness, how friendly you come, how good you are. spirits get among a good people. We have got to put you to a test. We are going to try you by the word and by the spirit of God. It says many shall come in my name Christ. I'm anointed. I'm anointed and shall deceive many. the spirit of the devil working in deception. And he says, "And many false prophets shall rise and deceive many." And he says, "For this shall arise false Christ anointed, anointed by the Holy Spirit, but upon their spirit in their soul. They have the wrong spirit. Remember brother sister the scripture says or the prophet preached anointed ones at any time why are people anointed and not born again because the scripture says in the last days from the book of acts pour out my spirit upon all flesh upon all flesh They can prophesy and see visions and dreams. But false anointed and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders so much that if it were possible, they shall receive the very elect. Behold, I have told you before. Look, brother in Revelations 13, the scripture says that the devil, the beast, he signs wonders, receive them to upon the earth, that they might receive a mark. And when they received that mark, it's the mark of condemnation. It's because the people can hear the voice. They see the sign and are deceived by the sign. Not discerning the voice. But the scripture says, "There is a voice of the sign. And to every sign there is a voice which comes with a sign. In other words, listen brother, every miracle, every sign, every wonder is determined to bring repentance. [Applause] That is the scripture. The scripture says unto you, [Applause] if the works that were done in you, if the works, if the miracles, if the works, if the wonders, if the signs that were done in you were done In Sodom, he might have revenanted his chosen, every sign, every wonder. miracle is determined to bring repentance and to the peoples of the world not to just draw attention or to get money glory because God does not share his glory but he wants the people to repent that's why he does the works because if you don't believe the works he says believed a sign and he the son of Abraham the time came he wanted to bless his son and according to him he wanted to bless Esau but Jacob disguised himself [Applause] and to be like Esau. &gt;&gt; And when the prophet Isaac &gt;&gt; touched the hands of Jacob, the sign that these are the hands of Esau and the voice of Jacob that the prophet blessed him anyhow. He went with a sign. I understand that it was of the Lord. But I want you to understand in the message a time of decision says that God is a prophet. Sometimes make a wrong decision and he was talking about Isaac. How we follow the signless yet the voice was contrary to the sign. Sure. The voice is not the scripture but in a sign is scripture. Amen. Take the voice, leave the here it is, brother. He says in Matthew 7, let me read it there. Verse 15. Beware of false prophets. Which come to you in a ship is clothing. But any ravening wallpap can be so tender soft. &gt;&gt; She might be so soft. [Applause] But if she's a cont to defile you, that preacher over there come to you tender. But if it's conting to you just right now, I don't know. Try it by the scripture. I don't know what you're thinking about. I don't know what you did. What you think about wondering was that the Lord the time of decision You can choose right now. You can decide right now. You can start with your soul says you shall know them by their the true spirit of God. It must it must cast out devils. It must heal the sick. It must raise the dead. It must take up sance. It must do great signs. It must do wonders. It must do miracles. And it must bring forth the life of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; None of this should miss out. [Applause] The fruits which is love. peace and patience, long suffering and meekness, faith and temperance and gentleness. It's has got to come forth out of that spirit brother and the spirit of God which is the true spirit must stay with every word. So if they are signs, they are wonders, they are miracles, you are seeing a little bit of fruits, but they are not staying with the what the fruits you are seeing are just for a time. Nature given virtues. There are people created naturally. They are kind, naturally joyful. If they don't start with the word, don't rush. Don't rush. Don't rush. Don't rush to conclude. Don't rush to conclude. That this is the spirit of God. You might disagree and shout as shouting can be expressing joy but let the word come. What's your attitude towards that word? What's your attitude towards that word? The people run to and from seeking the signs, wonders and I want to have a mighty man of God. They continue wondering to and fro till the prophet says why are people to brother sister. The spirit of God stands with every word and it believes and lives by every word, every word of the Bible. But on the other side, the antichrist spirit. It can be in a man and he can do wonders and miracles, but he can't produce the fruits and he cannot believe the entire Bible. Because the antichrist spirit is a party gospel preacher is a party gospel preacher. &gt;&gt; I'm missing that word. &gt;&gt; The antichrist spirit is a party gospel preacher. Thank you. Amen. I believe this, I don't believe the other. Amen. Is a party gospel preacher. &gt;&gt; I will preach that but that I don't want. We often times approach the word and pick out what we want. Moreover, friends, even the friends we pick, we pick such friends that will take sides with us even in our foolishness. We want friends who will lean on, who will stand with us, who will come on our side in our foolishness when he lasted after his sister. He had a friend and the friend said, "What's the matter?" He said, "I love my sister." And the friend said, "I've got a big thing to worry about. Let's lay down and do such and such." And he he helped him in his own sin. That's the kind of people we choose. Listen, brother, we are not here. We are not here to be cheerleaders. I'm not a cheerleader. Pastor is not a cheerleader. Not a cheerleader. He is a mentor. He is a mentor. He's not here to cheerlead you. Oh, this and that. Brother, you are right. We are not here to b your back. We are here to see your back. We are not here to just pat you on the back. We are here to see scratch your back to make sure that you stay in line because the prophet said and I saw this bright getting out of the line and I stay in line. That's why you bring the word and we are full gospel preachers because we know the word of God is the son of the thoughts and even we know that it's only the word that can keep the seed. The word is the rain. The word is the seed. The word is the ground because the child of God is the word. The word receives the word and when the word meets the word then something has got to happen. Remember the antichrist spirit is a part gospel preacher. And when he went to Eve in the garden of Ethan, he preached that to her a party gospel. I want to believe. I want to believe that if and the serpent that if and the serpent were good friends because the Bible says the serpent was more subp than all the beast that God had created and when he came to Eve the Bible starts and says the devil say oh yeah &gt;&gt; I maybe was responding [Applause] as evil preached to him. You know, God created trees in the trees here. I see. And they will say, "Oh yeah." Oh yes. Amen to that. God said, "You shall not eat of every tree of the garden." And he substituted the what? and she he preached unto her a part and she received it and she conceived. What she conceived was murder and murder comes from hatred. Any time you get a wrong spirit and believe a certain enticing spirit, you see it starts with hatred. Listen brother, Satan has ministers. Second Corinthians 11th and he says, "I'm afraid. I'm jealous of you jealousy." He says that the devil did be should be you also. And he said we are not uh it's not a surprise that the devilers of Satan [Applause] disguise themselves as messengers of light. The devil will come to you with a revelation. He will come to you with a dream. He will come to you with a vision. will come to you with an inspiration and you will think it is of the Lord. Watch my brothers what will come out of. Amen. anointed ones at any time. The devil came to Martin Luther with a crown on his head and his shoes on his feet. &gt;&gt; Oh, he came to my and he said, "Martin, worship me, Martin. I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; Worship me, Martin. I am your Lord." And Martin watched the scripture running in his mind and the prophet said that is a Pentecostal bait. &gt;&gt; It is a snare to the Pentecostal church. They would believe it. our brothers and sister today who believed that the rapture was September 23rd you are still here. I said brother I told her brother I owe you a rep when comes I repentance in other words no you have to repent to me is this listen we are brothers and sisters anointed of the devil by the devil And I believe they anointed by the God by by God. They saw a vision of God. I saw Jesus. I saw Jesus. And I want to ask you, but man of Jesus. Did you see? I saw an anointed. At the man of an anointed, did you see? [Applause] Martin &gt;&gt; when he looked at this Jesus and he said go away from me Satan you are the ground the scripture says the saints will crown him in the last days the saints will crown him. So where did you get that crowd? Look brother, you would come running maybe one of you or someone not here would come say I saw Jesus. Oh my my my my. I saw Jesus. He had a crown. He said, "Worship me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I see visions. &gt;&gt; It's not a mighty thing. It's a single vision, brother. It's not a mighty thing to make someone mightier. It is to reveal God. It is to reveal God. So there many people today They run like that. You know, I looked at this fellow. I I started with a memon and he told me, &gt;&gt; you know, Joseph Smith, he saw God the Father and God the Father, introduced him, God the Son, and I said, "Wait, wait. God the father was here and God the son was here. I said yes. I said a v that vision is false because one on the throne now that is false. God is one. Now look certainly transforms himself as a messenger of light and be the people. Amen. In Acts chapter 8 verse 5, the Bible says, "Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and he preached Christ unto them, and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them. And many taken with pulses, and that were them were healed. And there was a great joy in that city. And there was a certain man called Simon which before time &gt;&gt; before time in the same city the sorcery and bewitched the people. He used sorcery. and bewitched the people of Sam out that he himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of God And to him they had regard because that of a long time he had bewitched them with sorceries and they believed that one that is in the church today. Listen, as Simon bewitched the people of Samaria in a message recognizing your day and its message, when God showed the prophet a vision of the bride and he saw that bride moving. Then he says, "Then I saw this modern church which is led by the witch." Brother, sister, that's paragraph 47. recognizing your day and its message. There are people today in the church that don't know they are bewitched by the spirit of Jezebel by enticing spirits. They do not know that they are as he bewitched them and they believed him a mighty man of God. But when Philip preached, they were delivered. So when the message was preached, There was a great deliverance even as Philip preached and the people were delivered. So this witch this witch today working in modern churches bewitching the people making them act the way they do. It's what God sent the message. to deliver the people out of and he said set these people free and he said gets of hell to the name of Jesus. It is a message of God's deliverance. It is a message that opens the eyes of the blind. It is a message that turns on the light. Listen brother, if it is contrary to the message, don't believe it. It's of the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message is Christ. So what happened to the people of Samaria was because they didn't have the spirit of God. So they couldn't discern. They couldn't differentiate between the spirit. They couldn't not they could not uh they could not know what spirit was in Simon. But when the gospel is preached, I want you to hear my brothers. When the gospel is preached, it calls your attention. God calls your attention to a personal examination. [Applause] Not just excitement, not just a screaming, but a personal examination to examine yourself. Will you be in the faith? We are not here to entertain you. No. Heaven has no entertainers. Heaven has no comedians. Heaven has a sober men and women. Heaven has only praise and praise is not entertainment. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise is not entertainment. It is praise. Entertainment is entertainment. The gospel is not a joke. The gospel is not a joke. It comes to discern you and to shake you, brother, and to get you in lying. The Bible says second Peter chapter 2, as there were false prophets and teachers among them, so there shall be there also among you and Jude wonders of the same. And Acts 20 also, it says, "Men shall arise, not from the outside among your own selves to draw disciples to themselves, enticed by spirits." He says, "As it was in the old days, so shall it be in the end times." Brother, sister, there was in the days of of of Elijah, in the days of Micaiah, that when God was determined, there was a wicked king that had gone astray off of the what? The king and God wanted to destroy that king. And God said, He called for a meeting &gt;&gt; that he may fulfill the word of Elijah. And he said, "Who shall go and receive help that he may go into the battle to be destroyed?" Some of the deception is to your own destruction. Yes, sir. because of your stubborniness. If you get too stubborn, God will allow you to go into an illusion for your own destruction. Therefore, God says there came a lying spirit and he said, "I will go. and deceive him. How will you do it? I will go in the prophets. 400 of them gathered before the king and they were filled with a lying spirit. Yes sir. You will go to your fellows, your sisters, you grow with your size. We love to take advice from our agements. It's an error. Don't do that. He deceived one of the kings in the Bible. And he he forsook the c of the old men and he took the c of the young men that destroyed him. see such people and you say, "Oh brother, shall I do such and such a thing?" And these fellows you have grown up with, &gt;&gt; they are babes in Christ, &gt;&gt; just young like me, they will deceive you. Go the pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; And say go to the pastor. enticing spirits. The lying spirit entered in this prophets and they all told him you will overtake it. You will win. You'll overcome you come out with victory and the horns. And he said by this you will drive them says the Lord. But because was so minded centered [Music] seeking he he he gathered these prophets very certain that they will validate desire and they said you go and you overtake it will tell you that you go &gt;&gt; you you go &gt;&gt; watch out brother Sister lying spirits yet the word of God had already declared against you can't bless what God has come and you compare that with today it's what the people do just They want something that's positive. They don't want to hear something contrary to what we are here to preach to you that your spirit may get into subjection to the spirit of God. that your flesh may submit to the spirit of God. Therefore, we have to preach God [Applause] no more. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Enticing spirits. &gt;&gt; He says in paragraph 42, Now in the scripture, let me go to 40. Oh, if people could only realize that's why I come this morning and ask you to remember me as I go overseas. Someone who come the other day and said, "Brother Brham, you think it is wrong to do a certain thing?" I said, "Why do you question about there is a question in your mind? Leave it alone. Don't do it at all. Just stay with the doubt. When you start to do anything, And if it is a question whether it's right or wrong, stay away from it. Don't go into it at all. Then you know you are right. Amen. Now all things ought to be considered prayerfully. First, seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these are things shall be added. It says all things have got to be considered prayerfully first. You don't just come to a conclusion. You don't just come to a judgment. You don't just cut off people anyhow. You don't just choose anyhow. You don't make decisions anyhow. You don't speak things anyhow. First do things anyhow. First consider it. Try by what spirit lying spirits go out into the people. They go out into the people and deceive them in the days of Jeremiah. Jeremiah was a prophet of God called of God. And Jeremiah received the word of God. God told him, "Go and tell the children of Israel 70 years they will go into captivity." After that, Jeremiah 25. Then in Jeremiah 28 came and he broke the chains with such an anointing with such an anointing and says it shall be two years shall break the bones of captivity and bring you back in. Thus says the Lord. Amen. God perform his word. But it know the prophets that were before us and the prophets. The prophets that were before us. We know that if the prophet will say anything When it comes to pass, you shall believe him. Then God said Jeremiah and tell Ana because he has said that [Applause] he shall die. &gt;&gt; What was the matter? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Thought it was God and he was so sincere and he came with such an inspiration and said the Lord two years but the prophet has said. Wow. Be careful brother sister. When God says anything, whether you believe it or not, be quiet. Don't say anything against it. Don't say anything against it. Lying spirits, they come amongst people here and they will each other, talk about one another. destroy each other, do this and that and push one another, kick each other in the home, rather against that. It's because of spirits. Someone has believed it. Someone who rise up with a certain doctrine and this one rises up with this. This one goes with that spirits. Janice and Jambra because they could do magic and enchantments. They thought they can do something. They thought they have God. They thought they have the power of God. and say the same thing as Dennis and with Moses. So the people with stand the truth. You can feel it that someone is withanding it. I always wonder when I tell someone that such is that this and that. And they say no. Then I ask him then what is it? Then they say I don't know. Then I say then you what is the matter? If it's not then what? You know if it's not the message then what? It's not Jesus then what? So God must vindicate your word. God must vicate your word. He must vindicate with your your deeds. They must show up in your deeds. Don't rise up to impersonate somebody. It's it's a spirits of impersonation. trying to act like someone do what someone does. Mount up to something. There's many people calling themselves today, things that they are not trying to do things they can't do. Honor things All spirits must be tried. All ministers must be tried. All sisters must be tried. All of brothers must be tried by the word and by the spirit. It does not mean that we don't believe that your brother doesn't mean that we don't believe your testimony. No, &gt;&gt; we want to be certain because many false spirits have gone out into the world. Amen. I'll just leave out many of these things. I don't know. Let let me just read this quotation. God keeps his word. 1957 paragraph 44. Prophet says, "I have the deepest and highest respects for women. My mother, my mother is one of them and my wife and I have young daughters and a woman that keeps her place and is a lady. There's nothing any more precious outside of salvation in our nation than a real woman. But when but when it comes to a place to worship women then you are out of the Bible plan and that's the age is woring women voting women employing women now sisters are saying brotherh Brother, &gt;&gt; I'm not saying you sisters. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about what you also know in the world. What does this people demand to be to employ these people is woriing women? Then you are out of the Bible plan. There's no woman. There's no plan in the Bible for us to worship any woman. A Mary or a St. Cecilia There's not one spec of the scripture for it. It's against the scripture. Then if this this was the beginning of this who walk with with Christ says now the minister or the priest who spoke to me said God is in his church. I said God is in his word. God is in his word. The Bible said so in the beginning was the word and the word and the word was God and the word was made fresh and brought among us. God is in his word not in the Old Testament. There are two ways of understanding a message to be correct that when a prophet prophesied or a dreamer dreamt a dream He told that before the breastplate of Aaron and he says that if when they were they used to go there and speak the vision dream if God vicated it the spirituality come from the temple and he vindicated the message was it If the light does not flash, no matter how realistic it seemed, no matter where it seemed to be, it seemed fitted together with the time. If the spiritual light on the did not flash, it was rejected because God was not in it. Then he says, "And I said today, oh, I want you to hear any message regarded." It was from priest. &gt;&gt; It was from priest. Oh, it was from preacher, from prophet, from anything, any man. No matter how spiritual, what his office is, what he has done, if he has raised the dead, &gt;&gt; if he has healed the sick, if he is the archbishop of if he is the pope of Rome, if he's the head of a great denomination, no matter how spirit spiritual. Though he has spoke with tongues, though he has danced in the spirit, though he has preached the gospel, no matter what he has done, his message doesn't come out of the Bible. It is wrong. This is God's believers. We have got to be sober and sit strong. &gt;&gt; We are not people that is shaken by every wind. You say you are shaken because so and so so and so so and so. It's not about that. It's wrong. If it's not of the Bible, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stand on our feet. We We just can't finish this. Let's just cut it off there. But if someone comes to you and acts in a certain way and you have the spirit of Christ, the prophet says in discernment of spirits that your own spiritual discernment will tell you that that's wrong. Amen. The Bible says the anointing that we have received the same anointing teaches us. Brother, sister, my intention of this message, my objective, the objective of this, &gt;&gt; I want you to to to to to try the spirits to strike try the spirits because whatever things are done. All these things are done. Repent this, do this, speak this, all of this. What the spirits you are believing certain spirits. There is a spirit in you. There is a spirit leading you. There is a spirit making you to touch. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you don't want to discern that spirit. You don't want to. And you don't want to agree that wrong. A son of God when he's wrong is wrong. You accept I'm wrong. I'm wrong. Try the spirits. &gt;&gt; Don't just fly off to your husband. Don't just fly off to your husband. Fly off to your wife. Just try fast. the spirit you to do. These little things, little little things, they start that little a little heaven. Before you know it, [Applause] it goes from one sister to another sister. A sister dresses in a certain way. She walks in a certain way about a certain way. It goes to another sister. brother does this, goes around his sister, sister, that a sister tells this one, the other church, it is a spirit poisoning you. Try the spirits. Amen. &gt;&gt; Try the spirits. Why the spirits start with the spirit in you? &gt;&gt; I want you to think about it. I I won't even sing a song right now. I'm done now. I want you to think about it. Examine yourself. Judge yourself. Check yourself now. Judge yourself. Look into yourself. What you do, what you say, what you fills your mind, the decisions you are making today, the choice, the decision you are about to take, the choice you want to make, the things you are to do, what spirit is leading, I want you to go deeper, look around you just around your life you and God alone how many times you do things before you know you find little children are doing them also I'm talking to you mother I'm talking to you father you find they are doing it think about it brother How many times the things you do you find young men they are doing it thinking it is right because they think of you to be spiritual. You are corrupting the church. They think of you to be spiritual and you are driving them in the wrong way. Thank you for an example. They are watching you but you are believing certain spirit. How many times you sit around sisters talk to them about so and so and it flies over is a certain spirit. It's going to destroy us. Think about how many times God has warned you don't do that certain thing. Don't do it stubbornly do it over can you lay down now and unbelief like Peter who was sinking. I said, "Lord, help me. I don't want to do it." Think of all the times the pastor has told you. Stop that. But you don't want it's a certain spirit. How many smons I've waited for? calling you to come to God, but you are you are believing a wrong spirit. Telling you this is a lie. That spirit is the one who is lying. This is the truth. This is the word of God. Everyone just close your eyes. Keep your eyes closed. reently. [Music] Don't empty your mind. You say, "I'm emptying my mind. I'm emptying my mind." No, no, no. You will receive a wrong spirit. Have your mind sober. and say, "Lord Jesus, I come. I'm here, Lord. It's been many times that I've gone astray. It's been many times that I've not listened to your spirit. Listen my brother, there are times you come into a fix. But if you pray, even if you take a wrong decision, God will still come through and deliver. But if you didn't pray, he can't come through for you. Just surrender and say, "Lord, I want something real." Why do you take a wrong thing? &gt;&gt; Why would you take a wrong spirit? When the heavens are full of Pentecostal blessings, you know that devil &gt;&gt; that makes you think you are great brother that makes you think you are great sister. It's the flesh. It's nothing but clay. [Music] It will pass away. Just yield yourself and say, "Lord, I come just as I am. I pledge allegiance to the Lord. Speak to him. Speak to him. Don't just shut off. Shut off. Shut off. with Jesus. You may not have this moment tomorrow. You will say, "Brother, I will break through when I go back home." No, no, no, no. Break through now. I said, "Brother, when I go home, you have this moment." Oh, Lord, I take this moment. Just use the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I know you are here. Just start with me, Lord. &gt;&gt; God, work on me [Music] to give me something real, a spiritual thing, Lord, that will not pass away from me. Something that can change me now, Lord.

The atmosphere now is good. &gt;&gt; Jesus is here. &gt;&gt; I'm certain that he's here. [Music] &gt;&gt; He's moving now. this way. Just let me touch the house. The high priest. I know he's here. You can't be warmed by a painted fire. You need a fire now that can burn the chapel. What's the trouble? My sister, what's the trouble? My brother, come here weary. &gt;&gt; Are you tired? &gt;&gt; Are you lonely? &gt;&gt; We are not lonely when we are with you. When we are with Jesus, we are not lonely. Say, Lord, touch me now. Touch me now. Ah, touch me now. Lord, put something in my heart, Lord, that will make me a real Christian, that will make me a real brother, make me a real sister.
