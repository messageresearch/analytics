[1:28:45] some of you who don't understand what
[1:28:46] i'm talking about
[1:28:48] i want you to look at it this way
[1:28:51] that each of you is the same gene of
[1:28:53] your father
[1:28:54] you
[1:29:08] you know elise was doing certain things
[1:29:12] and then i was telling her
[1:29:14] to get out of here and then he laughed
[1:29:16] a second and then i said why'd you laugh
[1:29:19] at that but she behaves like you know
[1:29:47] you cannot do it like somebody else
[1:29:52] [Music]
[1:29:58] there is a gene in you while you win
[1:30:00] secret movie that's what only constrains
[1:30:02] you to behave like your origin
[1:30:18] somebody else
[1:30:21] you cannot do like somebody else
[1:30:25] and then you want to behave like father
[1:30:26] wonder you're gonna win single
[1:30:27] granddaddy you want to dress like you oh
[1:30:29] yeah
[1:30:30] you want to walk like

[1:30:55] [Applause]
[1:31:00] it may take
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:32:30] [Music]
[1:32:52] you may even realize your own father may
[1:32:54] be ever a certain way and then he said
[1:32:56] everyone is no children
[1:32:59] different from you
[1:33:01] but yours
[1:33:03] is also down from the genes
[1:33:32] [Applause]
[1:33:48] you know in our
[1:34:12] [Music]
[1:34:39] it's not something you try to be to
[1:34:41] behave like city into gaza cook ways i'm
[1:34:44] a christian because
[1:35:13] i know who i am
[1:35:15] and i know where i am going
[1:35:18] that's why we don't give up
[1:35:21] a true christian doesn't give up
[1:35:24] because they know their true origins
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:22] and
[1:36:28] was in the transgression yeah you know
[1:36:30] no not adam see adam so now the question
[1:36:33] is can i choose the teaching why didn't

[1:36:37] can't go chosen okay i will tell my
[1:36:39] father
[1:36:41] he didn't do it
[1:36:43] why
[1:36:44] because adam knew one thing
[1:36:47] that he
[1:36:48] did yet please follow me here
[1:36:50] there
[1:37:03] you remember when god created everything
[1:37:06] that we are turned up he was looking for
[1:37:08] something that was perfectly in his
[1:37:11] images

[1:42:26] because that
[1:42:41] he was the one that saw yeah you're
[1:42:43] never
[1:42:44] and ah
[1:42:46] one of my boys
[1:42:50] you shall be caught
[1:42:53] praise the lord come here
[1:43:08] please if you have the right answer
[1:43:15] adam is the one who initiated the
[1:43:18] contract
[1:43:22] some people already see where i'm going
[1:43:23] i wasn't talking about the video it was
[1:43:25] not me

[1:43:34] god myself
[1:43:35] it was not me
[1:44:03] he put me on the rock of the world the
[1:44:05] antichrist gamble
[1:44:08] that's what love is okay
[1:44:11] and now time came
[1:44:13] to come when it fell now

[3:36:26] i don't want to get into the details but
[3:36:28] i can just give you a little overview go
[3:36:30] and pray over
[3:36:31] you
[3:36:32] know
[3:36:43] for the officers for the work that we do
[3:36:45] in the offices of printing of the
[3:36:47] message
[3:36:51] this is not uh
[3:36:53] uh
[3:36:54] only for the church here hsc
[3:36:57] now we are now supplying the whole
[3:36:58] country
[3:37:00] together
[3:37:30] and so i've been trying to see if i can
[3:37:32] purchase that piece of land but then
[3:37:35] what
[3:37:36] attacker
[3:37:37] just for that
[3:37:39] office but then 50 100 would be about 80
[3:37:42] millions 100 millions
[3:37:47] for the church we also are looking for
[3:37:49] 100 by 100
[3:37:53] so i was thinking maybe we can try to
[3:37:55] look for the
[3:37:56] i can because this is will be a like um
[3:38:00] on personal investment
[3:38:04] maybe to make it a bit easier
[3:38:07] for us to get charged
[3:38:10] we could
[3:38:14] those are two plots there's a product to
[3:38:16] be one plot blue team would be for that
[3:38:18] uh printing project
[3:38:21] the other one for the church
[3:38:24] i'm engaging the engineers to see if
[3:38:25] they can be able to engineer a big
[3:38:27] building in such an area
[3:38:34] i need to i want to talk to you about
[3:38:36] this with a proof
[3:38:54] we should have our church land i believe
[3:38:55] that
[3:38:58] i said at first five years
[3:39:02] how many believe with me this year we
[3:39:04] should read
[3:39:20] we
[3:39:31] and uh i know she screams with us money
[3:39:34] quality services
[3:39:48] church not in a specific place like
[3:39:50] i can't say your finger
[3:39:52] can you go home you know what i believe
[3:39:54] is i believe that this message
[3:39:57] does not need to be preached in our
[3:39:58] corners
[3:40:01] this area where we are one away tree is
[3:40:04] the area of the headquarters actually
[3:40:05] it's like the headquarters of the of
[3:40:06] catholicism
[3:40:10] they have their biggest right there
[3:40:11] marina
[3:40:30] soon
[3:40:38] [Music]
[3:40:44] so god bless you come along and keep
[3:40:46] fulfilling your pledges
