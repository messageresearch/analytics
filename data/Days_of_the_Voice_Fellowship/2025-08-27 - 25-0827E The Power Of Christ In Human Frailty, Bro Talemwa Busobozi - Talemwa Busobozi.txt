But help us, Lord. Help us to give them spiritual food in this season. For you know what they need. I I humbly ask that you may have your way. Everybody that will be under the sound of my voice tonight having a hunger and a desire in their heart to hear from God that you may come and minister to them. Grant it Lord in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless your church. Good evening. Just want to in the precious name of our Lord Jesus. Turn to your neighbor. Greet them. God bless you. Nice to see you in the house. &gt;&gt; Amen. always happy to see those who make it on Wednesday because I know it's um not entirely easy to be to be in church on Wednesday. So shall we turn to our Bibles this evening? I'm also speaking to evening light by tabernacle. evening gather on Zoom to tonight. We send our greetings to the saints that are streaming this service on Zoom. We are reading 2 Corinthians chapter 12 and you know when we are speaking uh on Zoom also so we just do an hour. [Music] So just try to stay with me. May God help us. Um 1 Corinthians 12 we reading from verses 7 to 10. And I'm reading in the name of the Lord. Now I read. Okay. I'm I'm I'm reading from my wrong chapter here. supposed to be chapter 12 7. Yes. Unless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan, to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure. For this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might be that it might depart from me. And he said unto me, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. forch. [Music] [Music] Okay. Are you reading verses 11 as well? &gt;&gt; Which verse is that? &gt;&gt; There is 10. &gt;&gt; That's 10. &gt;&gt; Okay. Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For when I am weak, then am I strong. [Music] [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May God bless the reading of the word. So this evening I'm just um having a little subject. The power of Christ in human frailty. The power of Christ in human frailty. in human weakness. Praise the name of the Lord. Have you ever been weak? Have you ever been weak? All of us here are weak. There is none strong among us. And all of you um under the sound of my voice, even all of you brethren on YouTube or Zoom or whatever it is, you know when I said that, you smiled because you know that you are weak. There's none strong among us. And you see God wants it to be that way. I want you to imagine that you were in in a situation where you never had a weakness. You you were just perfect in everything, in all your behavior, in all your speech, in all your actions, in all your words, you know, in all your thoughts. You are perfect. You are good. Do you think you would need Jesus? &gt;&gt; You would not. And the fact that Jesus came, you know, God came in flesh to do the work of redemption shows that none was good. None was perfect. And that he came that we might be perfect. That he came that you know to become sin. that we might become the righteousness of God in Christ. And because he knows that within us, you know, there is no perfection without him. Amen. So if you have ever been in a moment or you have ever felt in your prayer, you prayed, "Oh God, why don't you take this thing away from me?" How many have ever prayed? You don't need to raise a hand. You don't need to raise your hand but you know God sees you but I can almost tell you 100% of us and there are many people who would rather say I would like to be like somebody else I like to be so like so and so my friend never pray that prayer you do not know how that person is but you will you will be amazed to know that you are good in that you think that you are bad And you think they are good because they are not weak in the spot you are weak in but your weakness is not their weakness but they also have a weakness and sometimes when you get to learn their weakness then you will even feel you are better and so you feel like oh I I don't want to be like that and and and matter of fact you will always want for to be like somebody until you come close to them. When you come close to anybody, you will find that they have a spot of weakness. There is no human being that is exonerated. From Moses right to Jesus, &gt;&gt; every human being Every human being, brother Brham had lots of weaknesses. Elijah, Ezekiel, Paul and and we can Isaiah, all of them. And now you can put your name among them. So if you have a weakness tonight, you are in good company. If you have a weakness tonight that you wish away, I want to have good news for you. That's why you are here today. And I I want to also tell you, God wants you to have it. If you do not have it, God will ensure you if you are his child that you come into that place of weakness if you are his child. In the message Christ is revealed in his own word. Brother Bam said, "I was just talking to a young minister and his wife in the room just a few moments ago and both of them are nervous just like the rest of the world, rest of the human beings on earth." I say remember Satan has got a punch coming at you. He doesn't care who you are. He's got a right for that one punch. Satan has a right for that one punch as far as your life is concerned. Which had you rather be that punch? Be blind or be an arthritic sitting in a chair or be nervous? And this couple was nervous. And was giving them counsel. And he told them, "Satan has a right to one punch." Yes. Satana has a right to give you one punch of us. There is a certain weakness in your life and God will permit and and and you know Apostle Paul called the messenger of Satan to buffet me. He called it a thorn in the flesh. And so this is a couple coming to brother Bham and they are nervous and and you know he said well there is one punch Satan has and so he said well which one would you like to be blind to have arthritis to be nervous or to be nervous? See he's got somewhere he can punch you. You've got a right to that open place. Now that's the spot you got to keep covered all the time. Each of us here have that place. And it's the weak spot that the devil knows that if he gets you in that area, he will have finished you. But then here is advising this. He says that's the spot. You have got to cover all the time. Praise the name of the Lord. And so Paul here, we'll get we will get to it later. But was introducing the message perfect strength by perfect weakness. And then he says if we have weakness we have strength. Can we say amen? It's unusual. It's an unusual subject to talk about in a Pentecostal assembly because we are always testifying. We are strong. We are strong. We are strong. If I ask how many are weak, pastor, isn't that negative? We are strong. But brother Bam says he was going to talk about weakness. And I'm going to quote so much out of that message today. And I'm going to encourage you to go and listen to that message, perfect strength by perfect weakness. I listened to it last Sunday and it really blessed me. He says, "There was," and I I'll read for you a little nuggets here and there. There was a Methodist brother and brother and I want to begin with this story that he gives. And I and I learned that children when they're following a preacher, they they they love listening to stories. Whenever you tell a story, children don't miss that part. So he says there was a Methodist brother, three of them that come to the church in Ohio or they come from Northern Indiana. &gt;&gt; They said to me not long ago said, "Brother Bernham, we just received the Holy Ghost. Shall we now seek for gifts for our ministry?" I I don't I shall we now seek gifts for our ministry and you've heard most of most of the Pentecostal brethren most of them really believe in doing that seeking for your gift and God will use you remember we have 1 hour so you'd need to be in one spirit with me and let's go let's go a little fast brother so see that they say well I'm going to the prayer mountain for 40 days and I want to pray and fast that when I go back God will use me to do miracles. God will use me to do this or to do that. They know in the area where they want God will use me to speak tongues or to interpret or I want to be a mighty preacher. I want to shake up my country. I'm seeking a gift, you know, to go and shake the country. So they go for fasting for 40 days, for the night, even for more. And so now this this these brethren, they had come all the way from Indiana. And they came and asked, "Brother Brana, they said, we just received the Holy Ghost. Shall we now go to seek for gifts for our ministry?" And brother Bam said, "I I said I don't do it. let it alone. And he turned and looked at me and and said, I just read a certain brother's book that told us after we received the Holy Ghost, we should seek gifts. How many have heard of that before? After we receive the Holy Ghost, we should seek gifts for these to use this Holy Ghost. And I said, and then he added, Brother Bam is now answering and become a stuffed shut. soft shadow somebody who is boastful you know and you find that many of those people like that they always feel that they are more spiritual than others they always feel that God is using them more than other and and if God has not spoken to them God has not spoken to anyone unless God speaks to them God cannot speak to anybody and that's what a staff shut to boast, you know. And then he says, if you notice in the Bible, it is always those who are trying to get away from it that God uses. As long as a man wants to do something and he thinks he's got enough ability, he can put the job over. God could never use that man. And he says, "Look at Moses running. Look at Paul running and the rest of them." And I can say, "Look at Isaiah. Look at Jeremiah. All of them were running. Whenever God called them, they were running trying to get away from it." And here he says, "I say don't seek nothing. God has got anything. If God has got anything for you, he will give it to you. See, and and and let him take care of that. I said, then you get some of these times like we got that everybody's wanting to do this and do that and become some great big person. Look what we got into with it. Instead of trying to to be great, we ought to we are trying to find out how little we can get. Can we all say amen to that? Amen. find try to find how can I build little. &gt;&gt; Notice the weakest and the rejected and practically every hero God ever had on the front line was that type of person. Do you want to be a hero? Humble yourself. find out how little can I be? A person that was rejected, a person that thought he was insufficient, a person that had no ability at all. If you feel that way, then you are going to be used by God in such a mighty way. Let me tell you, brethren, God is not looking for a great person to use. God is not looking for uneducated person to use the credentials of God that he looks at the unqualified. He looks at the weak. He looks at the feeble and then he uses them to change the world. He uses them to change their families. He uses them to change their country, their society, their generation. Listen, if you're insufficient, a person that had no ability at all, then that person is just in a good shape. So God can start using is when they feel like that they can't. They haven't got nothing. That's when God can take a hold of them and do something with them. But when we are thinking that we are able, then God can't use us because we are wanting to do it ourself. Go and do some research in church history. You will find all the great men and women that God used right from the Bible and in a message in in the in this message that I'm reading for you. Brother quoted very many in the Bible and in church history. You will find that these were people who were so afraid, you know, they were so weak that they thought that they cannot do anything. Some of them thought that life had ended. Some of them thought that they are good for nothing because when they looked at themselves, they saw an end. They saw failure. They saw nothing. But those are the ones that God to and called. God loves calling a nothing person. Amen. God loves calling a person who feels insufficient. Somebody who is unqualified. You know, don't ever say I cannot serve God. Serving God is for those who have never done anything bad. Well, let me tell you brother, you look at all people that God is using, people who have done everything bad. Everything bad. Look at Moses. He was afraid person. When Moses thought he can do it, that's when he did it wrong. Everything he messed it up. He murdered somebody. God never wanted him to redeem people by murdering. But Moses thought he was educated. Moses thought he knew what he was doing. He had strength. And as long as he was strong, God left him alone. God left him alone. Even if he had a purpose for his life, maybe God has left you alone. Maybe God is not helping you because he knows you don't need help because you are strong. You can figure everything out. But brother, you need to be weak. You need to come into that place where you are feeble where you know you are weak, not a pretense. And I'm talking about a reality, a place where you can break in his presence. When you go to prayer, you say, "Oh God, see, there is nothing good in me. I've disappointed you in my life. There is nothing I can accomplish. Help me." Moses, it took 40 years to for God to be convinced that he's now nothing. He came to him when he's an old man. He didn't have the strength to fight. So he will not kill anybody else. Amen. Then God came and said, "Now Moses, you remember 40 years ago you wanted to serve me. I am now here. I am ready to use you." Moses said, "What did you say? You have come too late. I am no longer strong. I am now weak. I am feeble. I don't even my tongue. I can't speak well." You know, now can you use somebody else? I am not the right person. God said that's the reason why I have come because you don't qualify. I've come to qualify you. May God qualify you, brother. Some of you, God has allowed you to go through certain things that he may qualify you in your home, in your family, in your neighborhood, around where you live. Never feel that you cannot serve God. The moment you feel unqualified, you are in the right spot. You are the right man. You are the right woman. You are the right person. The moment you feel broken, you are the right person God wants to use. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And when God sent Moses &gt;&gt; to Egypt, Moses went there. Oh, brethren, &gt;&gt; relying 100% on God, 0% on himself. And that's why God wants to use people that are weak, that are frail, because they cannot rely on themselves. But they will rely on God. You will say, "Pastor, you don't understand. I have made an irreconcilable mistakes." That is why God has called you into this message such a time as this because he wants to use it when you are weak. Moses he reached a point whereby you know when he went there you remember when they were going to cross the Red Sea when he reached there he went there because he was following the leadership of the Holy Spirit he couldn't rely on himself but then at this moment he knew he had no power no ability to make this happen. The man started crying. This is a man who was once trained as a soldier. He had all the strategy of war but at this time he could not use any of it and he started crying. Who who cries but a baby? A baby cries because a baby is helpless. Hallelujah. Because a baby is weak. Brother said the only thing a the only thing a baby does if they want something is to cry for it. And you see with our churches having fewer and fewer people crying in the presence of God. Crying just crying in the presence of God. It shows you have everything figured out. You know where's that brokenness? relying on on another. Moses cried and then God came down. He said, "Moses, why cry? Speak." Now, you might say, "Moses could have spoken." &gt;&gt; Yes, he could have spoken. But he could not trust in his words. Amen. The power to make that happen was in him before he even spoke. before he even cried. What was that power? That is the power of Christ. And that power is in you today as a believer. That power is within you. The kingdom of God is not coming with observation of our mind. The kingdom of God is within you. But yet we still need to cry to the Lord. Amen. And then he will lead us. You don't just speak because you want to. You know, you have to speak by leadership. Brother Brham was a prophet, a man of God, but he never just said anything. Then he had to first see a vision. When he rose one child from the dead, then the other parents said, "Raise ours as well." He says, "I can't unless he has showed me faith." You see, because he was relying on God, not just on his own faith, but on God. And God wants a church. God wants men and women who can rely on him. And brother, sister, when you rely on God, you learn to cry in prayer, to agonize in prayer, to wait upon God because you know you are weak. You are frail. But within you lies the power of Christ. But when God leads you, then the devil will be shocked to see you speaking in authority. When you speak in authority by leadership, those words are created. Amen. He said but when we are thinking that we are able to do it then God can't use us because we are wanting to do it ourselves. Amen. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. And so listening and then the other side we get these feelings and we think then that we are insufficient and we don't want to do it but then we just listen to the call of God. That's the very thing that God wants us to get into that kind of a shape so he can If there is one thing I have known to do, oh 19 years I've been preaching this in this message is to know that I need to yield myself to him because I can't. But he can. And if he's in me, then the power that created heaven and earth is in me. I can't but he can. When we are insufficient ourselves, then we are subject to yield to God is spirit. As long as we think that we can do it, then we can do it. But when we get to a place where we know we can't do it, then we yield ourself and he does it. Oh God, you know I'm a preacher, but I can't preach. God, you know I'm a Christian, but I can't live a Christian life. God, I can overcome this. Yes, she knows. And because you have received the revelation that you can then he will. Amen. So then if it's us trying to do it, we will fail. But if you will just yield ourselves. Someone asked me pastor what does it mean to yield yourself? Yielding yourself means you know your weakness. You know you don't have the ability. But you know when you go to serve him, you are not able. So you come to a place where you rely on him, not on yourself. So you come to a place where I say, Lord, you know how I am. I take myself out of the way. &gt;&gt; I'm weak. I'm bad. I'm I have issues. I have use me and then you he steps in and then he begins to use and the world can't understand that that's why the Bible called it a mystery Christ in you his power dwelling in you uses you in such a way that even you can't understand how it works. Brother Bam, many times he would say, "I'm just your brother." But when the spirit of God would come upon him, he would say, "Do you believe me as his prophet?" Oh, sorry. I I didn't mean I didn't mean to say that. I didn't. So, what was that? It was the anointing. It was Christ in him speaking. Many times he would say I had one tape when he would say this is me talking this is you know like not not William Bham speaking he's just using my lips and that's what we believe brother God must use you in your weakness in your frailty sometimes you don't even know your weakness other people will be the ones who tell you your weakness Accept your weakness. Do not refuse it. Accept that you are weak. And then begin to work towards yielding yourself and letting him come and take over. So then if it's us trying to do it, but if we will just yield oursel to God, then God cannot fail. There is only one thing that God cannot do that is fail. He can do anything else but fail but he cannot fail. That's why the Bible says I can do all things not in myself through Christ that gives me strength. So the power of Christ is in human frailty. Amen. So as long as we are trying in ourselves and depending on our own ability and so forth, we will do nothing. But when we get to a place where we know we are nothing, then God can use us. Amen. Can we say amen? &gt;&gt; The important thing, one of the important thing that we must master. This is your master's degree today. Now remember this and especially you younger preachers and I know there are many younger preachers listening to me and especially you younger preachers and members alike. There is one thing that we've got to master. If we expect to fulfill God's desire in our life, that is we have to master the thought of human ability. You know, you get to a place and you you be like, you know, I know I can do that. I can do that. And then that's when you begin to see people comparing themselves to another. People who believe in human ability, they don't believe that that they they cannot do it on their own. They will always compete with others. You know, you know, when when someone does something, they will want to show that I can do it better. When someone sings in a way, they will want also to sing because someone sang and they want to show that they can do it better. When someone preaches, they also want to do the same thing. You find that even many times ministry is out of done, out of competition. You see, let me tell you, when a minister competes with another, it's no longer God. They are using their human abilities. You know, I have no reason to feel insecure because of anybody else ministering. You know, you know, you you find that oh, I I fear so and so I can't even welcome him on my page or I cannot even preach because he may outdo me. And you find ministers fighting against ministers because of insecurity. Insecurity, not because they they they don't know that God called them, but because of insecurity. But why would you have insecurity? You know, I've told many of our ministers here and I meant it and I really meant it and I can say it even and I've said it even I used to say it in Ethiopia and I would say look brother if one of you would like to start a ministry and you're from this church and you want to start a ministry so close brother you don't need to ask for my permission you have you have it 100% if God has called go right ahead and start. I will even support you even if it is 1 kometer from us. And that should be the attitude of every pastor, every minister. You know why? Let me tell you why. Because there is no minister that has a special heaven to take anybody to. that if you are in my camp, you'll go to heaven. If you in the other church, I am not sure. It is one Christ using me and using the other ministry. &gt;&gt; But and I'll tell you one more that there is a minister who will minister with the power of Christ. If it's with the power of Christ, you are not afraid of competition. You're not afraid of being outdone. You are not afraid of what somebody else will do. You know, you will support them. You will encourage them because they're your brother. And when God leads them to win in a certain area, it is all our victory. Hallelujah. When that goes somewhere and he baptizes 30 people, I will rejoice because it is like as if I have baptized them. Why? Because we are not competing. Christ is not divided. You know, if you are operating under the power of Christ, you do not believe in competition. You believe what my brother is doing. As long as it's led by God, it shall stand. And let me tell you some more. If a man of God stands up and does a certain thing under the leadership of the Holy Spirit, better be sure never to fight it. Never fight any minister any man of God. Because to fight it, it means to fight God. Church, we have to understand that it is not about a minister. It's about Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Even the things I'm speaking, you may not like me. You may not love me. I don't care about that. But I warn you, listen to what I'm saying because what I'm saying is not by myself. It is by inspiration. So then it is no longer me. It is God. Just like any other preacher who would speak under the leadership of the Holy Ghost. So it is the power of Christ in human frame. Brother many times he would say you know you may not you may not uh you know uh respect the man but respect the office he holds in God. God respects the office of the man he calls. There was a man one time called Elisha. And you know Elisha made a mistake because he was angry. You know these children came out shouting baldhead bald head bhead. He said she bears come and eat these children. How many were they? 40. All of them were eaten alive. Brother man says because their parents couldn't teach them how to man of God. The man of God did something wrong but because he spoke. God honored the office. God honors the office. Amen. And we we may not respect the man but always we must respect the office. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. So if we ever get to a spot where we think we can do it on our own intelligence and our abilities, we've got to master that in such a way we can get rid of the thing and lay it aside that so God can use us. Amen. Amen. Amen. I've found that my my best services services that I felt I didn't have anything to say. God did things until I was shot. You know, I tell you what, God loves human frailty because he always wants to be glorified. And then they came and say, "Oh, our pastor Moses, look, he married an unbeliever. They were right. They were right. But they didn't understand Moses had to do that because Moses was a man that actually failed. He failed from the beginning. He failed all through. Can I give you a little examples? He failed in the beginning when he killed you. He he failed later on when he went and beat the bush, the stone twice, the rock twice. He failed when he called the children of Israel rebels. He abused the children of God. He failed. He failed when he went and married, you know, an in all those failures. In all those failures, God said, "He is my man." And let me tell you, that's the same thing God is saying about you today. God is calling you his own because you are a failure because you failed to make it on your own. That's why he said, "I will go down on earth and I will die for them." Amen. And I will give them my blood that they might be called my own because they have failed me. I will go and stand for them. Praise the name of the Lord. Don't ever let failure take you out of the presence of God. He came down and he said, "Adam, Adam, where thou?" He said, "I'm I'm naked. I'm hiding. Who told you you were naked? Did you eat?" Adam said, "Oh, the woman you gave me, don't you worry. Just come out." And he gave him cos of skin from the very beginning. God showed he was interested in human friendship. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. They will continue here and make a complete surrender. Make a complete surrender. We cannot use one ability. We've got to make a complete surrender and to come to God. And you've got to surrender to him both soul, body, and spirit. everything that you will be surrender to God in order that he can work his will in you and me. Now that's hard and I know because we are always wanting to power to put out to put our part in and something that we know we know that we want to do it. Well, I just know it should be done this way. But as long as you are doing it that way, it's going to be wrong and God will never use that. Maybe the help of the L with the help of the Lord. We are going to get into that in a few minutes. Just show you how God cannot use your ability. Amen. And now all of the human race is frail. Paul prayed three times asking the Lord to take away his thorn. The answer was there is sufficient grace. Our weakness is not our end but the beginning of Christ's power in us. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. The moment you are weak. Christ has started to work. We cannot boast of anything in and of ourselves but we boast in Christ. Amen. Romans 3 says to declare I say at this time his righteousness to declare it that he might be just and justifier of him that of of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of what? name, but by the law of faith. Ephesians 2:6. And he has raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places. Don't look at me preaching. Preach with me, child. in heavenly blessings and treasures that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches. Remember that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us. Hallelujah &gt;&gt; through Christ Jesus. For by grace are ye saved through faith. And that not of yourselves it is the gift of God. Not of works. And that not of yourselves. Amen. Lord of words said man should boast. For we are his workman. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't care what the devil thinks about me. I don't care what the people call me. I know one thing. Amen. I am his workmanship. I am saved through faith, not of my own works. It is the gift of God. I am created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God has before ordained. God before I was even born ordained that I will walk in the good works for the good works are not going to be done by me but by the power of Christ. Hallelujah. regardless of my human frailty. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You should stop saying I can't do it. Stop looking at your works. The more you look at your works, the more you will fail. Stop looking at the work of Christ. The more you will be changed and the more you will overcome. Let me tell you, brother, sister, the things I used to do, I do them no more. Why? The more I realize, Amen. The work of Christ in me, the more grace to overcome I have, Amen. And I still have other fruities now. But I'm a work in process. I am changed. I have been changed. and I will be changed. Glory. Hallelujah. Galatians 6 says, "But God forbid that I should glory." Praise the name of the Lord, save the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. By whom the world is crucified unto me, And I unto the world to me the world is dead. &gt;&gt; If the world is not dead to you yet, if you still convert the things of the world, brother, let me tell you, you are still relying in your human ability. Start relying on his ability. Amen. You realize you cannot glory in yourself but you will glory in the cross of God. By whom? By whom? By Jesus Christ the world is crucified to you. For in Christ Jesus made the circumcision ath circumcision but a new creature. Amen. Colossians 1:26. Even the mystery which has been hid from ages and from generations. But now is made manifest to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory. Amen. Amen. But God forbid that I should glory saving the cross of our Lord Jesus. Are you following? Are you following me, church? to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of the boasting of the power of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you when Christ is in you can now begin to boast not in you yourself but in the work of Christ in the power of Christ the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. And as I I approach to finish here in the message shalom Paul said now brother says now like Paul said hallelujah he had an infirmity something was bothering him the devil would buffet him blow after blow maybe that's you blow after blow blow after blow and he consulted the Lord three times to take it away from him said I don't want this Lord take it away from And then one night the Lord spoke to him and said, "My grace is sufficient." He said, "Then I will glory in my infirmity. I will glory in it. I know you are the hearer." You know why? Because Paul realized, Amen. that this infirmity was bringing down the glory of God. So, hallelujah. He said, "Praise God. I'm no longer sorry about how I feel. What I'm not able to do. I will glory in my infirmity. I've seen you heal the sick. I've seen you raise the dead. I've seen you cast out devils, open the eyes of the blind. But I've consulted you and you tell me it's your grace. Then this devil that bothers me is growing pains of your grace is growing pains of your grace. Then I'll glory in my infirmities. If I lest I get exalted above the abundance of the revelation with the revelation we have if God never allowed any family to come we would be I don't know how it will be we would think that we don't need him so he said I have to control you lest some of you begin to go higher than me that's what the devil did in the beginning so he allows those infirmities to come so he can control your power so you can remember he's the boss. Amen. Times may be hard. God has not for promised a flower bed of ease. But he has promised grace sufficient for every trial that can hit you. Grace is sufficient. Tell your neighbor grace is sufficient. Amen. When a cross gets heavy, Christ promised to be there with you. He will be with you in weakness. And Paul said in first Corinthians, as I'm approaching to finish now, and I, brethren, when I came to you, I came not with excellency of speech or declaring unto you the testimony of God. For I determined not to know anything among you, Jesus Christ. and him crucified. And I was with you and I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling. And my my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man in demonstration of the spirit and of power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God. Amen. And brother Bam would say, "Could you imagine a man, a Pharisee of the Pharisees, a teacher of the teachers, a man that's been trained trained for the ministry to be an eloquent man that was smart and brilliant to come before a class of people like the Corinthians and and he would say, "I was with you in weakness and in fear and maturity." A man who turned the world upside down. the greatest missionary that's ever been known. He confessed that he come in weakness, not as a trained scholar, but in weakness and in fear, lest he should step off the path somewhere in much trembling because he could not trust in his own ability. The reason he was fearing not because he was scared of an enemy, but he was scared he would displease God himself. They would get his own ability mixed up in something that he had learned. He was telling them, I didn't come to you with this excellence of spirit, but I come to you in fear, but I would come that way. But I come to you knowing nothing but Christ, not with theology that I knew. I counted it as death, but I came to you knowing nothing but Christ. And Banam would say the biggest enemy that you need to fight is you because you always get in God's will. That's the one that gets lazy. He's the one that gets to a place sometimes where he thinks he can do something and he shoves God right out of the picture. But when I can get this guy out of the way, when I can get to a place where he is completely out of the way, then God can come over and do things that William knows nothing about and does things that knows nothing about. That's when God can use you. That's what he That's when he can use you, any any of you. He can use anybody when we get out of the way. But as long as we in the way, then he cannot use us. Let us stand on our feet. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, may God help us. God took Paul and made a slave out of him. He bound himself. bound him to himself and he sent him to the Gentiles which he hated. But you see, he had to lose Paul from his ecclesiastical power to be bound to the power of God. He had to lose his strength and become weak and nothing in order to receive the strength of God and be bound to God to do what God would tell him. May God help us to do that. And he says that's what every man need is a loss of himself, loss of his ability, loss of what you are. You might have a complete yielding to the Holy Spirit. The housewife needs that. The school boy needs that. Even our little children, we need to become empty that he may power in into us. Say, Lord, here I'm a vessel. Power in me of your spirit and lead me that I will follow. Lord Jesus, forgive us. Many times Lord when we have relied on our humanity oh God you don't mean to do that have mercy Lord when we have failed you many times because we think Lord we not do much we can do so much but we realize it's not the one that can do it it's the one that cannot do it and that happens to be me today I don't have the ability it happens to be my brother my sister here those in the homes perhaps on Zoom perhaps someone on YouTube listening in or maybe they will listen to this service much much later Lord I pray that you will come and visit them father somebody here Lord praying in their heart saying Lord I have relied on my abilities to help me to trust in you to depend on how you will do it. Not how I can do it. You know better. I know nothing. That's how you want us to be. Lord, help us. Help the ministry. Help the young people, the ministry, the lady, everybody come bring us to that realization Lord. It's my desire, my prayer &gt;&gt; in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord prepare me. &gt;&gt; Come on, take her. Take &gt;&gt; me a sanuary.
