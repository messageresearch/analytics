[Music] let us go to our scriptures now in the book of second Corinthians chapter 5. we are reading from verses we're just reading one verse and then we shall visited verse 20. now then we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's state be ye reconciled to God let's pray father Lord we just want to commit this reading of the word into your hands Lord the scripture we have read and more that we shall read in this service we commit them into your hands Lord may may tonight be a blessing father as it has already been now as we are going to share a little portion of scripture and I thought your people I pray that you anoint me and that you will make it a blessing to each and every one of us in Jesus name amen you may be seated so I'm speaking to you today on a thought ambassadors of the Kingdom anybody that does not understand English if you can lift up your hand well I trust we are good to go so uh tonight I just want to have a little thought with you something that the Holy Spirit made real to me today and I want to share it with you just to encourage you more especially in in our prayer meeting and then I know by the time I'm done we might not have much time of prayer but at least we will have a little time to once again speak to the Lord we've already worshiped him and a meeting is not done without the word being shared amen So speaking about an ambassador an ambassador is someone that is representing a country or a state in a foreign land if you go to the American Embassy you will find an ambassador there is the American ambassador is representing the president of America and are you the one I think you are God bless you yes you're welcome back from school actually both of you you're welcome God bless you so um uh talking about an ambassador an ambassador is someone that represents as a government and is speaking or rather doing whatever is doing on behalf of that government or a kingdom in that matter in the in the past used to be kingdoms not governments like it is today but of course our kingdom is a government so now the Bible says now then we are ambassadors brother if you can project those verses we are ambassadors for Christ we are ambassadors for Christ can we all say we are ambassadors for Christ so that's what I'm speaking on tonight ambassadors of the kingdom of course the kingdom of Christ is not the kingdom of the world but the kingdom of of God the Kingdom of Heaven in Proverbs 13 17 up to 18 it says a wicked messenger falleth into mischief but a faithful Ambassador is health poverty and shame shall be to him that refuses instruction but he that regards reproof shall be honored now the scripture here speaks about a wicked messenger falling into mischief and a faithful Ambassador is the health now we need to understand about an ambassador in one sense is also a messenger amen an ambassador is also a messenger a messenger that has been sent like I told you he's been sent by his government to represent his government in another kingdom or in another government so now the Bible here calls him a messenger in Proverbs and he says but a wicked messenger falls into Mischief so meaning you can be an ambassador but a wicked one you can be a messenger but a wicked one meaning not doing exactly not representing your country well not representing your kingdom in the right way and then he says but a faithful Ambassador is Health now this is where the health here I know the Bible uses it in many other verses but one of it that the Bible uses it is where he says that God wants us to be uh to prosper a also in health so when when it comes to health here he's talking about Prosperity he's talking about uh increase he's talking about a good life he's talking about blessings he's talking about success so a faithful Ambassador is going to be successful as success a faithful Ambassador is going to progress a faithful Ambassador is going to increase our faithful Ambassador is going to be blessed a faithful Ambassador is going to not be poor okay and faithful Ambassador is going to be blessed amen so now here the Bible says Verse 18 poverty and shame shall be to him that refuses instruction straight away after he talks about our faithful Ambassador being rich or successful all Progressive he talks about now poverty and shame coming to him that refuses instruction now you need to understand that an ambassador does not act on his own behalf an ambassador acts on the behalf of his president he represents his president to act on his behalf so an ambassador really executes the duties that he is instructed by his president to do are you following me so if his president gives him an instruction and he tells him do ABCD and for him he doesn't hear instruction he doesn't follow what is president or what his leader told him according to the Bible poverty and shame shall be to him now you don't want to have poverty and shame you want to have increase and blessings praise the name of the Lord you want to have what and blessings you want to have the riches that Christ gives you want to increase in everything that you do you want to prosper in everything that you do you want to see the hand of God being open to you the blessing of God being open to you but that cannot happen unless you are a faithful ambassador now we in the same way we have a kingdom our kingdom is not of this world our kingdom is of above and Jesus Christ is our leader is our president he has sent us on a mission down here on the earth to be ambassadors of the Kingdom so we are representing him here did you know that wherever you are wherever you are you are representing the body of Jesus Christ whatever you are it doesn't matter where you are it might be at school it might be at your place of work it might be on the road it might no matter where you are today remember where you have been the whole of today wherever you have been wherever you have been you've been a representative of the body of Jesus Christ now if the things that you did was not according to his instruction he that sent us down here represented him you are not a faithful ambassador that's bad news isn't it but may God help you if you've not been a faithful ambassador from today from the service tonight that you will walk away and say I want to be a faithful ambassador praise the name of the Lord because you don't want to shove to suffer poverty and shame but you want to suffer Faith increase and success now I have the rest of the things that I have to read for you those are the two scriptures I wanted to read for you but I I have almost three or four pages from the message influence influences I've already lost my voice so I pray that you'll be able I will be able to speak well or through for about 50 minutes or so now from the message influences 1964 I'm going to recommend you to go and listen to that message or to go and read it I hope that we are message readers if you don't read the message or you don't listen to the message you cannot grow if you don't read the Bible you cannot grow as a Christian you need to read your Bible and listen to the message at least every day that will help you to have your spiritual masses to grow in the things of God you need to keep plugged in amen speaks about many things but uh I want to read for you a few um a few paragraphs like I said it's about four pages but that will be all I will share tonight and then we shall go in prayer so um brother if you can give me this quote on the screen so that the people can follow me now is first of all he talks about the President Abraham Lincoln this was the president of America he says now I think the greatest president though that we that we talking about the Americans ever had was Abraham Lincoln not because he was a Kentucky and two because brother Banner was at a Kentucky and would say that the greatest person to have ever had is a Young Southern Man Who was a minion called so brother is saying not because he was not because he was a Kentucky and but he listened to how he gauges him but it was because that the man come up from nothing and all the books that man that that man ever owned from the time he was a younger boy until he was of age God bless you I needed this so badly excuse me and he says and all the books that a man ever owned from the time he was a young boy until he was of age almost was the Bible and the bunion is Pilgrims Progress now he's talking about the former or one of the first presidents if not the first of the US United States and he says the man came up from nothing and he talks about the books that this man ever owned the books that this man read the books that this man had were two books from the time he was a little baby one was the Bible and another one was this book called Pilgrim's Progress how men have read that book or how many have watched the film Pilgrim's Progress now you young men and ladies that have not watched this and have not read this I don't know what you use your free time for these are some of the books that you ought to have already known because as a Believer I expect if you want to watch a movie or something or a film or a video you should you should want to watch things that are okay for your eyes as a Believer so you as a young person I remember when I first came into the message when I wanted to watch I wanted to know what can I watch as I believe and these are this is one of the things I watched so you should find it Pilgrims Progress it is a very good book it was a book but then they acted a movie out of it very good book I will not give the story of the book if you want to to know it those who have watched it raise up your hand so that you can see them and then ask them the details raise up your hand up high so look around look around those of you who have not watched it then after the service meet them and ask them where can I find it now see he says that he watched he read the Bible and he he read that book also and he says you see that molded into him what you read what you do modes your character what you'd read molds your character tell someone what you read about your character and that's the truth it molds your character it tells what you are and now you see you see that's why sincerely as Believers when you before you believed you were reading some of those magazines brother when I'm talking please put this off so before you believe you were reading some of those magazines we call it data magazines like red pepper and reading some of those old data novels and things like that these days people don't like reading they watch more than reading but whatever it is whether reading or watching you're up that should change the things that you were doing remember you were an ambassador the things that you were doing then should not be what exactly what you're doing now what is the problem with reading or watching there is no problem with reading or watching but the question is what are you reading and watching what you're reading and watching is molding your character if it's not molding your character towards loving God more and representing the kingdom of God more it is molding your character into loving the world more and representing the devil more so may God help us and he says it tells you what you are and now you see he read where if you did wrong you paid for it if you did right God would honor it and that modeled him what he was and his mother a Godly woman too he said if there is any credit given anybody it was a Godly mother that raised him right now that made I think I would say at least one if not the greatest president that we had he come up from nothing and God made him president because he was an honest man and a good man do you want to be blessed by God you should be honest and good you should represent the kingdom of God where you should not do what the world does you should be different I hope that this message is arriving home I have very little voice to tonight but I hope it's arriving well at home in your heart so this man became a president actually God can make you anything you want to be anything in this world but it is it should be and it must be on the basis that you are unharnessed and a good man and now he says now we find that this boy was the same having these Godly Parents he did that which was right when he was made the king and when he was 16 years old he ignored all the politics and the popular opinions of his day and served god with reverence oh may God help us I I love these things I love this quote as I was reading I said to myself I'm going to read it all to you Sister Sister Lisa sent this to me a little portion not this one but a little bit below and it had quite a lot of a substance and I thought I should share it with you tonight in our prayer meeting so please listen to that I'm sure it will be a blessing to you and he says when he was a meta King and he was 16 years old he ignored all the politics and the popular opinions of his days talking about here king a king who was called uzia in the Bible he ignored all the politics and the popular opinions of his day and he served god with reverence that made him a real king to ignore the politics and the modern opinion and served god with reverence that was very good his kingdom God blessed it it was so great till it was the next to solomonies and Saul and Solomon had the greatest that there was but this boy was next to Solomon in his kingdom it was a great help to the young prophet Isaiah and him being a younger chap at that time just coming on being born a prophet he was the influence that this man had upon the people and seen where his influence come from because he trusted God emphatically emphatically please follow me here now many people would say even they've come to me many in my life time not very long but in my lifetime many have come to me and said I like the way God has blessed you I like the way you are I like your life I'd like to be like you what can I do to be like you and then I've told them I've showed them the way of of God and the way of the word but not very many are interested on that part but here we find that Isaiah um Isaiah looked at he was here and he said he watched the influence that this man had upon the people and he seen where his influence come from because he trusted God emphatically if you see all of us have role models in this life of course apart from Jesus Jesus should be our main role model if you see a man or a woman if you're a sister that accept God or has lived for God and God has blessed them you should want to be maybe if you want to be like them that's not the thing you can be like them or even better but the question is are you ready to do what they did because he trusted God this was he had trusted God you are you ready to trust God ask yourself that question am I ready to trust to God are you ready to trust God in everything that you are doing or you want to trust man and he noticed again Isaiah did how that God will bless them that will be true to God this word God must bless those that are true to God is what it is a must for God to bless them let me tell you if you are true to God this word and God doesn't blessed you hey then I'm going to give you a right to question him tell me one man in the Bible that was true to God this word and God did not bless them every man and woman that was true to God is what God blessed them God blessed them God keeps his word God keeps his appointments it is people that don't but God is faithful God keeps his word if all of us were true to God this word I we should we will be walking in blessings we will be walking in power we will be working in Victory and he says now we realize that this younger fellow wanted to stay with the principles of what God Said he kept his laws uziya wouldn't turn right or left he stayed right with what the word of God said and God honored him and blessed him in everything he done he prospered he went right on hmm what an example that it is for any young person now let me tell you this is the way you see many people today of course as the modern Trends every day has its own modern Trends as modern Trends come up and you know you know civilization increase people always think that the ones in the past were backward and they think that the ones who are updated so when you talk about something when you talk about something that is in God is what people laugh at you and when people laugh at you feel bad and shame and then you stop talking about God's word are you hearing me are you hearing me if you're hearing me say Amen that happens many times especially the young people of course then you stop talking about God is word and then the word is called assimilate then you begin to assimilate you know you begin to assimilate you begin to look like them you begin to do what they do in order to pick their attention see if someone is dressing if they're dressing a skirt which is skimpy above the knee then you will also begin to do that because you need to assimilate to look like them so you don't feel ashamed but give me one younger man a young person or give me any person any Christian that will stand for God's word and see if God will not bless them in everything they will do they will prosper oh my God if I if I I was you sitting there I would say Amen I will prosper that's how I'm saying this they went right on he said what an example it is for any young person if you want Prosperity that's prosperity for you follow the word of God follow what the word of God says even if it is not acceptable before others if it's acceptable before God God will bless you for doing that and he says I think if we had we had people today our churches who claim to be Christians if they would abstain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it would influence the younger Christians to do so do you know we have all these people who are joining this church let me tell you do you know that people who join the church younger believers I'm not talking about younger in age I'm talking about young because they've just believed if they join the church they are going to watch or look at you who has already been here did you know that what I'm saying they're going to look at you sister said I'm happy to see you they're going to look at you they're going to look at you brother they're going to look at you and you see let me tell you the gospel we preach it is not much about what we talk about on the pulpit it's about your life the life that you live the life that you keep in your everyday day-to-day life is what is going to tell people what we are preaching here now if your life is wish you worship if you are doing things the way that you have even they who are just coming you're not doing they're not going to see the difference and do you know you have influenced them the wrong way and do you know you're going to be answerable for that do you know you're going to be answerable for that they would abstain from the things of the world and live that kind of a life it will it would influence the younger Christian to do so but today when they let down and drink and smoke and carry on meaning the Christians and they still try to hold their confession as Christianity that puts a bad stumbling block in other people's way and it makes it very hard you see how we should hold ourselves how we should behave what what kind of life we should live and then he says remember the Bible said you are leaving you are written a piece as read of all man now many people want to read the Bible but God has made you a living representative a living Ambassador many people will not read the Bible but you are the Bible they will ever read did you know that you were their Bible as you are working you are the working Bible you see you are the working Bible that people will ever read they were from the way you trim your hair to the way you dream you dream your fingernails to the way you dress to the way you talk to the way you do everything you do people are going to look at you and they're going to be the president you're going to represent the kingdom now I want you to ask yourself a question have you been a good representative you are walking yeah let us continue you are working late I'm just reading this quote for you you are working letter but I want to read it slowly so it can end up properly he says you are working later should be a working Bible Christ in you you should be a walking Bible Christ in you someone may never take this Bible and open it read what is there but let them look at your life and let it be enough for them to know I believe in Jesus Christ you should be the working word of God and if you profess to be a Christian and not that your influence what's your what are you influencing will make you have to answer for many Souls that you've turned aside that you've turned away from Christ in that day of the Judgment did you know that did you know can you believe it the things that you do of course of course if I do this it doesn't take me to Hell let me tell you if you do things that will influence others from Living God and they go to hell where do you think you will go you will follow them and you will be together with them why because you'll have to answer for those Souls that you turned aside and he says I think it behooves us tonight to think about that for every man woman boy God knows that you are coming to the Judgment every one of us you're going to come to the judgment you might escape this that or the other and he says you might be beat at the income tax you might use you might escape the entire Revenue you might do this or another you might have run over the speed limit and the cops never catch you um you know or you can you can do your own zigzags in the church and the pastor and the deacons may never catch you and you are still one of us and you're a Believer no problem he says that's all right but one day judgment is going to catch you that is Saturn and we know that man must die and after that there let me read this again can we read it together and we know that man must die and after that the Judgment now the problem is not dying everyone is going to die but the problem is that judgment part everyone must come to that place of judgment oh my God have mercy he says it's the Judgment after death that is the blood is the bad part and there what you've done on on life and how you've influenced others you'll have to answer for it at that day now let me tell you let me tell you listen that is why if you're a child of God and God wants you to go to the rapture and you do wrong with things he will not leave you to die before you correct them if you have ever been corrected either by someone seeing a vision about you or you've done something wrong and it comes up or you know you know or you spill some milk and someone understands or you stole this and someone or you did this and someone finds out and then you know you know the the pastor finds out that Deacon finds out and this and that and then you are corrected and here on Earth brother rejoice because you are a seed of God doesn't want you to go to hell that's why he's exposing you so you can be corrected here because he says judgment begins where what's up God but let me take this and I don't want to preach I want to read this quote to you he says and we know that man must die and after that the Judgment death is not a hard thing it's the Judgment after the death that's the bad part they had the bad part and there what you've done on life and how you have influenced others you will have to answer for it at that day brother sister when you find a brother or a sister in the wrong don't be quiet go and tell them no you're going to answer if you see someone doing something wrong and you let them continue you're going to also answer for it did you know the Bible says you will answer because their blood is upon you you've seen them doing something wrong and you didn't correct them but if someone is doing something wrong and you go straight to them not to another person again that's what the Mystic people do don't go to another person if you have seen a praise here doing something don't run to Peter or don't want to Marvin come to praise tell him praise what you are doing is not according to the word of course you may be proud oh well don't worry about his pride show him the scripture if he doesn't see it walk away you've done your part you're not going to serve people we are not people's savior we we are we are preaching we are telling them we are living our life before them and that's all we can do God must serve them if they're savable are you hearing me now if you are corrected if you are on the other side and you are corrected don't begin to have pride that's why even God doesn't answer your prayers because of Pride as we shall sit down here because of Pride you think oh I have arrived I'm a Christian I am not I'm going to hell that is already approved I'm a seed of God I'm predestinated or before the foundation of the world God knew me therefore and someone comes and tells you brother sister you have done this wrong you think that that would take me to help to Hell people are so much worried about going to hell they think even when they do things and they it won't take them to hell they think that that is okay listen a mature Christian a mature believer must reach a level whereby it's not about hell that you are fearing I'm not doing things so I don't have to go to hell or Heaven Heaven is already assured but here the things I am doing I am worried about being a good ambassador and why because I don't want to run poor I don't want to become poor I don't want to to be ashamed I want like we have seen I want to prosper I want to have success are you following me so so in other words I'm going to be so much concerned about pleasing the Lord and being a good Ambassador and following every instruction he has given me even I want to do more above and beyond more than what he has told me in the line of what he has told me so that when he meets me he will say Well done good and faithful servant are you hearing me Church so we don't do things because of fear of hell we do things because of the love of Jesus in our hearts now then here he continues on to say where where are we how much more out we should set aside every weight and the sin does that does so easily beset us that we might run with the patience this rest that is set before us looking not to the Creed but today or to the domination to some other person but to Jesus Christ who is the author and the finisher of our faith that is our president we are the ambassadors hallelujah how we should think them things friends stunnally and reverently as we see this day approaching and knowing that anytime your life's Pages the book may be closed tonight this when I read it I first held my peace for a moment and I read it again about three times it was just very real let me read it again how we should think them things friends stunnally and reverently again as we see this day approaching and knowing that any time your life's Pages the book may be closed night and tomorrow will be too late for you to do it don't put off what you can do today for tomorrow for tomorrow may never come you see another thing that has made Christians not be good Christians they always say I will do it tomorrow I'll pray tomorrow I I I will serve God tomorrow I will go to church tomorrow what if tomorrow does not come he says or tomorrow may never work tomorrow may never come men and women boys and girls may be sitting here tonight they may be in the MOG before daylight oh my God oh my God I hope it doesn't happen but we say it and it happens sometimes we've had stories of people living overnight and before they reach home they have already crossed over where have you gone that's the question would it be a shame for you to live a night service going back at home and then you don't arrive home and also you don't arrive home you understand what I'm talking about it would be a shame it would rather at least be that you don't arrive home but you arrive home you don't arrive home but you arrive in heaven that's what I'm talking about but imagine leaving the church in the night between now and the morning and then you go and you die on the way and you don't arrive home in heaven it would be a shame that's why it was it said it would be a shame for you not to hear instructions he said I'll put that right tomorrow or the next day or the other day friends I think it all to bring to us that conclusion in our hearts that love for God that desire to please God saying oh God I don't want to be tomorrow I want it to be today I want to live for you today I want to be a better Christian today I want to be written episode today I want to be you know the best I can today not tomorrow but today you see that's why even in prayer services you find people are not praying not because they cannot pray sometimes people think that you are praying because you have too many need someone to say oh no they pray so much because they have so many needs you think so we don't pray because we have so many needs praying is having fellowship with God have mercy on us listen you cannot have fellowship with God if you don't pray if you don't pray you cannot have fellowship with God even Jesus himself to stay in connection and fellowship with God he had to pray actually Jesus had constant prayer constant prayer every day Jesus was spending time in prayer you know not spending time in prayer is having fellowship with God we don't pray for what you need but you pray for fellowship with God to you people who are married do we know even sometimes if your connection with your wife if your fellowship with your wife or your husband is not good the home is not at peace you see but if you are communicating properly if you're talking properly if you are at talking levels huh yeah Brothers if you are talking whatever sometimes you are not a talking level sisters if you're not a talking levels with your husband the home is going in chaos but if you are talking levels and you're talking properly everybody's smiling and the home is at peace the home is at peace in the same way in the same way if you're talking with your husband properly just to know everything has been planning for you he will tell you about it but husbands have or men not naturally naturally men keep their Visions in their head and they only download them to people they can trust and have confidence in and when the atmosphere is right are you hearing me now the same way God you know we're in the we are created in the image of God in the same way God as our husband God as the husband to the church he keeps his vision in his mind he has he says I have good plans for you he said I have he himself I have good plans for you but he won't tell you the plans unless you are in a talking relationship unless you're in Fellowship brother are you hearing me brother unless you're in a talking relationship you must be in a talking relationship with God and what is that prayer when you are praying and you are communicating back and forth you see just like the fellowship we had a little bit before we went into the world that let me tell you Brethren that presence never trade that presence for anything never let it live your life because if it lives your life you're going to be dry if it lives your life if you come and pray until you feel the presence of God brother run you are in danger you're in trouble you are in trouble every Christian you should never have dry prayers if you have a prayer that is dry if you sing songs and you you are dry and you pray and you you are dry brother sister you are in danger let me tell you you are in danger if you die I'm not too sure whether you're going to heaven because you are not in a talking Communication in relationship with God you must be connected with the supernatural whereby you sing a song and you feel like your soul is is just no no longer here you are connecting with him whereby you are praying and you feel like it's no longer you praying it is him praying in you interceding for you and for other Brethren what is that it is you in connection with God but what is so sad many believers who are called Believers are not talking relationship with God they are not they are not and and because of that you find us having a lot of burdens and needs which are not answered oh God have mercy on us right you can change your prayer life tonight you see you see if you're not in a talking relationship for you to pray you you will say Allah let us pray and then at at home at the family altar you do it because they have said it let us pray amen there you go praying for food bless it amen you go any church even our you know prayer night is up to midnight so it's not a long time it's not a long time even if it was a long time you just come and sleep or even if it's not a long time you just come others are praying and then you're like you're following them oh man my words are finished I'm no longer have what to pray you just sit and begin dozing of praying what is wrong with you I don't have what to pray you have a problem let us admit it you have a problem first of all admit your problem here if you don't admit your problem you cannot receive a solution you cannot it doesn't matter whether you are white black red or yellow you must speak in a talking relationship with God your prayer your relationship with God should be not dry it should be wet full of his presence full of your tears you remember that woman who was on his feet you see even at your family out at your home you man you woman at your home the presence of God should come down oh we miss such times when you are at the family out and God gives Inspirations and God gives Revelations and oh my things are coming down from above what is that it's God people being in a relationship with God but what is it happening it is now just having a church a connections and the church church services church service ah we are just doing a prayer for everybody and everybody says Ah man now we are becoming slowly We are Becoming like the Catholics the priest is the one who says the prayer they don't pray they say prayers so I say the prayer and I pray the prayer are different things I say the prayer is only following words which are written somewhere Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be your name thy kingdom come thy will be done on others it is done in heaven amen amen and everybody goes home you see Believers are now beginning to be like Catholics we say let us pray if you want to know a congregation that is a church which is really vibrant a church which is really a church it is in their prayer life you see when you say everybody should go in prayer let the musician stop playing and hear if you hear one person amen another one yeah uh brother we not only need spiritual thermometer but we also need a we need spiritual blood transfusion we are dying it means we are dying it means we are on a blink of death it means we are so bad it off Brethren this is not a laughing matter this is a serious matter it is as serious I'm telling you it is a serious matter if your prayer life is dying and you don't have to let it die you have to fight and do everything you can to make it bring come back again to life whereby when they say let everybody pray don't worry some people even can imagine they want they don't I don't want my voice to be hard can you imagine we still have such a a a stupid excuses I don't want my voice to be hard I don't want to be hard as if I'm the one who knows how to pray better than others hey you're in prayer and you're fearing your voice to be heard so what did you come to do you were talking to your husband and you're fear and your voice to be hard is your husband is not anybody's husband it's yours if you're talking to him you don't care what others say it's your husband and you care about how he takes you how he receives you how he loves you so when you come talk to him you don't care what others are saying you lift up your voice you will cry out you will tear your tears will come down you will cry you'll you will shout you'll fall you'll do whatever you have to do as long as it brings the presence of God to you as long as you it can make your heart be connected that those moments when you are praying and you feel you are connected you feel you are seeing him you you you you you you feel he's hearing you you feel is near you you can almost see him by eyes of Faith that's what we call a Praying relationship with God Brethren let me tell you in that kind of prayer even Visions begin to burst out many times many many times when I'm in such kind of prayers you know others are praying and quickly I begin to to receive Revelations and because others are praying I can't begin to prophesy I quickly go pick up my paper and the pain and the I have my iPad but I cannot use my iPad to do that because it is usually fast it comes so fast I have to pick a pen and a paper and I scribble down those words and I write it quickly before that anointing leaves why because it is coming through prayer it is a connection with the supernatural you see that's where tongues also come at people you know with the gifts of tongues come out people with the you know Gifts of you know interpretation of tongues and prophecies and Revelations the Bible says when one person when you all have come together one person with the Revelation speak out and another one if something be revealed to another also now he or this one keeps quiet and the other one comes out how does that happen it happens in prayer some people even don't understand these things anymore because they don't know what prayer is prayer is not saying what prayer is connection a deep connection with the supernatural prayer is when you come before God and you talk to him and you you hear him speak back to you and you can hear him and he you you can he can hear you in other words it is a two-way traffic you talk to him and he talks back to you so now when you talk to him he talks back to you you now pray according to what he has told you so it's no longer now you speaking brother Ivan it is now him speaking through you when you begin to talk the first time you pray maybe you are speaking your words and what you feel and now when he speaks to you oh my God you even feel excited already amen you feel the fire burning on your heart and you begin to speak to him back according to what he has revealed to you in your soul you see but what happens people's hearts for prayer and desire for the things of God is dwindling down completely dying off completely dying of may God give Grace but I tell you what we need it it's the all-time Revival we need it Revival should never die the moment Revival dies in a church and there cannot be Revival without prayer there cannot be limited they cannot be Revival without prayer time time should come when we say the service is dismissed and people will be here praying until morning I'm telling you time should come if that time doesn't come we are not ready for the rapture okay you as a younger person who doesn't even have a job tomorrow you are rushing quickly to go you are the one who came in almost at 10 he said okay what time is it I don't want to go you know those things are still singing and praying let me just you're going to hear the one and then I go home it is because your prayer life has died and you you know yourself you're not at peace with God you're not very well spiritually speaking you must be the one to come and leave the fire in prayer in worship as you are worshiping God and you are singing that song even people who are some leading here always be sensitive to the spirit of God don't just sing a song and leave it and go to another one sing a song to get the people into the spirit of worship and the spirit of prayer what is the worship Worship Is glorifying God and God coming down to accept your worship it's not just a song it's not just a prayer we are not here to say prayers we're not here to sing songs we are here to worship and we are here to fellowship with God In Prayer that's what believers do and that's what makes the difference that's the difference between us and the denominations you see that's why many message churches no longer have prayer night services because it's a thing of the past we have the word why do we need prayer and you cannot have prayer you cannot have fellowship if you don't have prayer may God help us so that we don't die out because he's coming is very soon can you put up that court again so I can continue a little bit here down he says men and boys men and women boys and girls may be sitting here tonight will be in the MOG before daylight it is true and then you your book is closed and you'll never have another chance never this may be the last chance that you will ever have think of it seriously you say Well it probably isn't it probably isn't but it could be but remember someday the book is going to be crossed and what you are doing now you see that's why even I appreciate you who are standing because you are feeling sleepy I believe even sleep that comes when you are going to pray or when you are hearing the word it's demonic sleep I'm telling you it's not a real sleep it's demonic sleep huh who is that young man going out can you come back in here listen tonight I'm not only spiritually angry I believe the holy spirit is telling us things here what are the deacons doing I'm addressing especially him that was dozing and the other brother just come in let them come in you see when when you were when you were praying not only here in the church even when you were at home and you are praying what happens before prayer everybody's Lively everybody's jumping up and down now when we say it's time for family altar then you begin to see those sleeping demons coming and you automatically feel a lot of sleep and heaviness how many have ever felt that before you see and then after the family altar after prayer those demons live immediately am I correct so you can agree with me these demons it is sleeping demons the devil uses them to take away your desire and your strength for prayer or for the word the devil knows when is the moment the world has been spoken it let us now hear the word sleeping demons come let us now pray you automatically feel happy because it is a demon on you and the moment you go in prayer brother don't accept that demon to overcome you when you are hearing the word don't accept that demon to overcome you you better stand up in the church you feel yourself don't worry you're fighting that demon if you're going to prayer and we say let us now all go to prayer don't say oh now me I I am heavy I am tired it is because you have a demon on you it is trying to tuck you and be happy and put a lot of heaviness on you to make you not pray fight it until you overcome it how do you find it do what it wants you not to do if that sleeping demon comes on you and tells you don't pray then Brother begin to pray immediately fight it until you overcome it when you feel you can't open your mouth to pray what you do open your mouth and begin to pray amen because if you don't do that the moment you don't do at the moment you accept the devil will clap his hands and the moment the prayer time where you will sleep sleep and then maybe for one hour he will make sure you have slept and slept and then you even see Visions false Reasons from him and then you wake up after you wake up the devil will tell you by the way you have finished pray after all you have even seen visions and now from there you will now go and begin watching a video or something and you'll be very sober because the demon has already overcome you you see and your prayer life has gone down and you are spiritually low you are spiritually dry dry there must be something in the presence of God the devil knows and there's a hindering the people of God to come into that presence but let me tell you we have found out we have discovered him and he has been exposed next time we are in prayer brother break those demons those are religious demons is you are hearing the word they are bringing you a lot of sleep and when after the war then the Sleep goes away because it is a spirit on you resisted the devil the Bible says and he will do what he will flee from you Hallelujah if the devil tells you you can't hear the word your daughter I tell him I will hear it and I'm going to stand up and I'm going to wash my face and I'm going to hear it and the devil I'll tell you I'll even say Amen every minute I would say amen and I'll make sure I don't sleep Hallelujah you need to be strategical when you are fighting with the devil you need to be intentional you don't let you don't need to submit to him you need to fight him and you need to know your enemy you need to know that he that you are fighting is also wise he's very subtle you need to know him and you need to also approach him in that way that's why the devil heads these Services of overnight and prayer services the devil hates prayer time because he knows that's the only chance that the people of God have time to use this word they have in their hands the only time the only chance we have is when we can pull out our swords of prayer but I'm saying this is the weapon the greatest weapon that God has ever placed in the hands of mankind prayer when we wield the sort of prayer let me tell you demons disappear in prayer so spirits leave you in prayer deliverances are God In Prayer power comes upon your life in prayer the Holy Ghost comes upon you in prayer the Bible says they were all together in one according they were doing what playing cards watching a movie they were praying and then the horror goes he came down amen like a rushing Mighty Wind and Came Upon them the devil knows that that's why he will make he wants to make our worship dry he wants to make our prayer dry he wants to make our services so powerless and less of power you know whereby our preacher just preaches and then we became Baptists we just hear you know we're just here and we just shake our head that's a Baptist spirit but God has given us the spirit of Jesus Christ the spirit of this message to overcome those Spirits those religious spirits and those demons that come to take us out of the presence of God you see he even wants to calm down he fights preachers let me tell you that's why you should pray for your preachers pray for them pray I'm telling you pray the devil tries his best I don't know how many times and how many ways the devil's fault me that I know there are others I don't know of that God didn't tell me and yet he overcame for me but I'm telling you the ones I know of there are countless times I can tell you this and this and these are the devil used to take me out of the anointing he would try his best to capture a preacher and put him under his anointing instead of God is anointing and the pressure will come already a defeated preacher you think he's preaching but actually when he's under the power of the devil and these are the places who will tell you don't need to pray you don't need the Holy Ghost you just need to sit down and hear the word and everything like that because they themselves are powerless they don't even know the last time they went to pray they don't even know the last time when they sought God the last time when they felt the power of the Holy Ghost upon them and the devil tries that because he knows yes he's trying his best he will come from the pulpit all through the congregation to try and make us powerless oh church let us not be a powerless Church it must not be a powerless people you see you will try to bring sins there is nothing that takes away the spiritual app that for prayer like sexual sins those sins can make someone so powers that don't even have power to say Amen in the church you see no wonder brother one quote somewhere where he says that you see when you go and search some of those quiet quiet congregations of places or churches most of the Baptists kind of you know it says that they they they they are the Devils hang out the Devils hang out you see when you see those people very quiet like God on others dosing on others what nobody can shout amen nobody it is a devil's Hangout if you want a quote you will come I will give it to you a Devils the devil's hangout why because the devil has already overcame all of them the other one was in fornication the other one was in in this sort of immorality the other one was in there the other one was not the other so now all of the letter of the scripture what they have is the quote so we can quote you can read the scripture and we can quote for you brethren we are predestinated we are going to heaven we are going in the rapture even the prophet said this in this court and also Apostle Paul said this many believe that everybody says amen they just behaved so well just like you behaved now you kept quiet and then they said you can now go home so we sing A Chorus I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be nobody shout nobody jump nobody and those things you know just because they're defeated they're living defeated lives sinful lives they first hang out let discharge let this church oh God I'm hungering in my heart and you know my heart is just squeezed when I read these God's friends and I'm telling you that this church never be a devil's Hangout whoever will stand here on the pulpit be prayed up be prayed up because you know you're going to first demons you people when you are coming here be prayed up sometimes you can come here if you're not prayed up you will come in the church and someone is having demons on them and they will pull you into their Circle and they are sitting next to you not even now you realize why am I not able to say Amen anymore what's happening you about it I'm telling you if you prayed up you come here prayed up your prayer everybody has prayed up someone comes in with the spirit here I'm telling you it has to come out of them it has to come out because if they fire the Holy Ghost is here amen has to deliver the bound and they themselves will begin to say amen and certain amen and they will go out of here liberated those are the kind of services we want but the balam says if people can't shout I can't preach if people can't shout I can't preach why because they are not liberated there is spiritual no spiritual you know environment for him to do things for him to speak people can shout oh it brings down the presence of God if people can cheer the word and accept the one and receive the word let me tell you if you're bound by something you know by not by being quiet God help me I'm feeling yesterday Hallelujah the spiritual understanding listen if you you you you come in the church I'm telling you if you come in the church and you feel you are so quiet today I'm so quiet don't let the devil deceive you that you're just humble you have a demon on you charging you even say amen get it on you and remember what you did repent and come before God cry before him come early if you can before the service begins and pray set yourself free so that when the story that comes you will not say ah what is happening with you today no he himself have prayed you have prayed you musicians don't just come here with your dirty hands and begin playing the instruments if you come here come pray it up come pray that pray before you come to pray the instruments and when you touch it you'll be amen you'll be a touch of the Holy Ghost and he will come down you you cannot go on the instrument before praying I'm telling I'm warning you the only God knows the instruments before praying don't do that have some time at least 30 minutes in prayer communicate with him have fellowship with God don't come on the pulpit before your prayer that brother even said you should not stand on the pulpit unless you have received the Holy Ghost why because what you are going to tell us is yourself if you don't have the Holy Spirit speaking through you you see how much we want the Holy Spirit friends we want him to come down because any time it might be today he said it might be you see the chance is gone for you to to to change if if he you just die before you prepare yourself this may be the last chance that you will ever have think of it seriously you say Well it probably isn't and I said it probably isn't but it could be but remember somebody the book is going to be closed and what you are doing now and especially you people who are claiming to be Christians separate yourself from the things of the world have nothing to do with the world shut it share it all those evil conversations conversations I'll call them shine it don't be a part of them don't be a part of those that nonsense you see we left the world we can't be back again to eat any kind of talk that is not giving God glory even if it is from Believers shut it you have no part to do with it for some person is watching you what you're doing somebody's watching you and you are going to not only send yourself their meaning to hell but you're going to take them today to that bad place and you are going to have to answer for your influence how this Prophet watched this young man and seeing that God blessed him and how what an influence that was how that man prospered what God did for him he lived a life that was wonderful blessed of God and he wouldn't turn right or left now here we find another example here in this man this man who's here a great king who once worked with God the Bible said when the king left that he was secured well sorry when he felt that he was secured he felt that he was all right then he was lifted up in his heart with the pride May God allow with that none of you will be like that he now lifted himself up in Pride because now I'm secure yeah that first he started the spiritual now he became Canon he said with fire now you are kind of where is your fire where did it go you think you have arrived let me stop here to say this solemnly my brother my sister God has made you my audience tonight I must be dead honest in what I'm saying and you must listen to you must listen with dead honesty that's what the trouble with many people today we have some of our ministering Brothers some of them gets to a spot maybe big Ministries until they feel secure and we have a lot of this not only independent questions but also in the message we've had this not this to be true many ministers in the land they begin to drink some of them even think do you know even in the message they begin to drink when I've Got My Little Kingdom built around me there is no reason for me then people who love me so much until they will never pay attention to or if I do this or that or do that let me tell you brother there is one who is looking and that is God no man is secure the outside of God sometimes then we get to a place we think God blesses us he give me a Cadillac oh he give me a better job oh he give me this that's no sign that you can't turn his Blessing from you when you get lifted up and you feel well I was laid all night and prayed I once did this and I do that but I don't do it anymore you are on a dangerous ground see those days when you used to pray maybe all night or or you will go out in the tickets or somewhere you just go in the prince of God let me tell you each of you we must have an anger that hunger should never leave us the moment that hunger to pray leaves you brother you want dangerous that anger should always be there

God it doesn't have to be in a church it can be somewhere in a bush somewhere it can be on a mountain somewhere it can be anywhere even in a place in your home somewhere you just go and have time in prayer that hunger that hunger friends should not leave us we should not quench it with other things or something we should not quench to those things when you get lifted up and you feel well I once laid all night and prayed I was did this and I do that but I wouldn't do it anymore you're on Dangerous Ground that's what the matter with our Pentecostal people while back Yonder either time ago when
