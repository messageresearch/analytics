amen I know there more online yesterday we spent some time uh with a sister called sister fire F yes say the way you had it are you fight yes um uh she's Nigerian um Nigeria and and you know she um I think it was uh that morning of of Saturday the Friday night morning yes yes that is perfect interpretation so that's when I received an email from her and uh she uh desired to you know get baptized she desires actually to be baptized and she's just getting into the message she she got connected to us through the testimony of brother cosmas maduka bench and I know she's online we send our regards to you she lives ways away from here but she desires to find a place where she can be close to the church amen amen so we send our greetings to you our sister amen and your son also before we go to the word this morning I just wanted to make a few remarks regarding uh brother success where is he ah right over here um there are many ways I can do this but because of time I'll just give a few comments uh brother success okay just come up uh let I think it's better be said by your mouth if you could be little can you give him a microphone you will need to interpret him anyway so you have another microphone brother um I just have a question maybe uh if you can come over this side where you a minister come stand over here with me amen and so uh brother success told me was giving me the testimony on how he got to know about us I got my contact and all that just that part can you tell the people praise the Lord I'm grateful that I'm here um it so happened that last year in October I was from my field work so I branched over to a certain old man who has been in the message all along Ina so when I entered in his home I got some small box the box contain those MERS the message players so I asked him where can I get this message player he had no clue where we can get it he said he was also given and then I looked around on the box I found some contact and then I had to call that number it went through then I began to talk to that person that person came to be known as Pastor the rest is history bless you well like you said there's much we can say uh but brother success has been in touch since and he came in our Camp last this year in January I think it's been two years since you came to the message yeah so he was a minister in Christ Embassy Embassy uh but he was he was eventually baptized I think by some brothers in in nebe and uh brother sucess I love him for his Zeal and his love love to know more to get deeper into the word some time back I traveled with Pastor Robert kabasi to uh nebi and we was going to distribute a bunch of message players that our brother had purchased through us to the pastors there so we met like all the pastors most of the Pastors in West n and so uh we we gave them those some of you know who have been part of this ministry you know how you know the vision of the message player came about some years ago how you know I um felt that people should listen to the message of brother bam directly and so I took a piece of paper and Drew like what was what came to me as a revelation and little player with the buttons with numbers that you have an index and then you just you can just press that number and then a message will come and so all the messages of the Prophet are on that player but I did not know how I was going to realize that that dream that vision shortly after that I found myself in China long story short and I shared this bden with a brother there and uh he took me in a few factories because I thought this is something they needed to fabricate in the city called shenzen after seeing a few factories they had big players like big as Bible and I said no this is Buy so I felt that is not what I needed so I went back in we went back to the brother's office and as we were seated there just put my arms like this and thinking meditating and then a brother comes with this exact message player the one I had drawn was on the paper the brother brought it and put aside this one this is another brother who did not know English his name I think is brother L and so he came and put it there it was 100% perfectly identical I stood up it you know took it in my hands I tried to speak to the brother but he couldn't answer me because he did not know English and later on the other brother interpreted and told me that he also had a burden and for a while they have been using that same player in China you know God is amazing friends and you know that message player has helped very many by thousands in our country especially in Co when people couldn't go to church stay at home and just switch on very easy andise God so um I'm happy that at least through that we can be able to meet our brother success um he he has he has a burden for the message he just told me I would like you to uh your ministry to Mentor me into the ministry and so we've been in touch for a while and we hope that the Lord can use us to help him and the people there in nebe in a little way that we can be able to am amen amen praise the Lord amen I just thought I I I was thinking debating in myself should I say this today or should I not but I think I should say it because I want you to pray uh we are led by God's grace to start a fellowship in and um seeing how many people we've baptized so far there many of whom have not even been able to make it to church this morning because of Transport for someone to travel all the way there it has they have to pay 20,000 to go and come all those from here they

remember those things in prayer amen we are reading out of the book of eser this morning chapter one vers we can begin from verses two and read the first five verses and then be SE the Book of Esther the Book of Esther is after neiah before job behind job if you are there say amen I cannot forget to congratulate brother poap for finishing a level and you say bye-bye to Secondary School amen amen praise God that in those that in those days when the king aera sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in sushan the palace in the third year of his Reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of Persia and media the Nobles and princes of the provines being before him when he showed the riches of of his glor of his glorious Kingdom and the honor of his excellent Majesty many days even and4 score days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in sushia and the palace both unto the Great and Small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's Palace where were white green and blue hangings fastened with cords of fine linen and purple silver rings and pillars of marble the the bed were of gold and silver upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black and marble you can just read from up to verse 5 for Amen Let us just speak to the Lord for a moment father we would like to approach your throne we know we are not able at all the ability comes from you give meance Lord give the people uh the heart of reception that your word shall accomplish the purpose for which it is meant to to do this morning in Jesus name be seated this morning I am speaking on the king's search for a virtuous wife not know I could interpret that do you appreciate brother Julius this morning hey amen I I knew he would be uh where he was stormed on the very last minute know you would be interpreting this morning but let's pray for him amen the king is search for a virtuous wife amen tell your neighbor the king is searching tell the neighbor on the other side the king is searching amen so last Sunday I spoke on subject of the Lamb's wife that the lamb is the same as the king is the king of kings he's the Lord of lords amen sister phib I'm happy to see you God bless you and and so he is searching for a a wife I believe that I'm the I'm the wife of the king I Am The Virtuous wife of the king do I have someone who can say I am The Virtuous wife the king amen among all the women he saw me he loved me he chose me amen and I'm his wife amen the church is always typed as a woman and Christ is always typed as the husband of the church so you see we are the wife ofr but there are many who claim to be you see before I announced my wife many who claimed that I loved them or maybe they presumed that I loved them you see all these young men who are not yet into that there are many young ladies who are expect maybe that brother but you see yours is to wait amen the the ours we cannot claim him he is the only one that can claim us amen and we have many churches today which claim their misses Jesus Christ which claim their followers of Jesus they claim but does he claim them the Bible says many shall come unto me on that day and they will say unto me Lord Lord didn't we do many great things in your name s and wonders in your name but I will say unto them go away from me doers of iniquity I never I never I never knew you so he they claimed we know you but he claimed I don't know you and I believe is the same thing today there are many who claim to know Jesus but Jesus does not know them they claim to follow the word but the word has rejected them so the King Jesus is searching for a wife he's not going to marry everything he going to marry someone who is virtuous he's looking for a specific wife oh when I was looking but when I was looking amen I was looking for someone specific someone specific with specific characteristics you know I heard things that you could not replace let me first remove my cat so I can can preach properly if you don't mind praise the Lord hallelujah amen I like being free you know I can't dress properly and then when the speed comes I just feel like let me throw away all this are you free this morning Hallelujah you know I was specific in what I wanted I needed something that was exactly that was on my heart I could not replace it with anything else I could not compromise on it because I had a future that I wanted I had something that I desire to have and I knew it would it would come it would be because of the type of person I chose and so then I chose a woman of virtue I chose a woman that had some characters that were depicting what I believe characters that were the kind of characters I also heard let me say right here Brethren a drunker will always choose a drunk an immortal person will always choose an immortal person a bad person will always choose a bad person sheep will always choose sheep and God will always choose God you see you cannot choose something else that you are not you understand what I'm saying you know you've had many people say those of you who are married say my wife is bad well she's bad because you are bad you cannot be good and you choose a bad wife you can only choose something that you reflect yourself in are you hearing me church amen the wife your wife is a representation of you if you claim to be a God-fearing man your wife will be a God fearing woman if you claim to be prayerful your wife will be prayerful why because when you are choosing you cannot look for something beyond what you have what you are when you are choosing your eyes will only see who you are your wife will be you in the same way when King Jesus is looking for a wife he can never look for something that does not reflect him amen Jesus is looking for someone for a church without sport without wrinkle a church that looks exactly like him but today we are going to take it and and make a foundation out of the Book of Esther because um you know the Book of Esther there are some books that are in this Bible that without the revelation of this message it will be hard for you to understand them for example the Book of Esther The Book of Ruth I preached on it before the book of Song of Solomon some people even fear to read Song of Solomon because they feel those are words those are very spiritual words and they are addressed by the king to his Queen they addressed from Christ to his bride you know let me tell you friends you see the relationship of Jesus and his church is a love affair is a love affair it's a relationship praise the name of the Lord and so I want us to go in the Book of Esther and be able to type all this uh we we beginning with that Foundation praise the name of the Lord and so here was a king Kingus and um I'll not give the whole background as I did on Sunday but I'm going to show you here he sat on his throne in the of his kingdom in a place called suan and in the third year of his Reign he made a feast for the Nobles this Feast continued for six months which is a total of 80 [Music] days and after 6 months he made a fe to all the people of the Kingdom for seven days and he gave them to drink Royal Wine tell your neighbor Royal Wine praise the name of the Lord amen I hope that this morning someone can drink from that Royal wine and this Royal wine was drunk in vesses of gold the queen also she made a feast for the women you know this is from vers s let me read it maybe you you can just listen to it if you read luganda read in your Bible and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and Royal Wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to Every Man's pleasure also V the queen made a visit for the women in the Royal house which belonged to King aeras on the seventh day when the king of the when the heart of the King was Marry with wine he commanded Mechman B habon Biga and abaga Z and carcass the seven Chamberlin that served in the presence of aeras the king to bring V to the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on but the queen V refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamber lines therefore was the king very WTH and his anger band in him so you see when the king made a F the queen also made a fist and she made also a fist with our people and with the women and they said okay let's make a feist for ourselves because I'm the I'm the crown I'm the crown queen I'm the queen and so I have the crown the Royal crown on me I'm beautiful the king loves me I know he already married me he cannot chase me away because I am his wife so let me do what I want I am in his Palace but let me do what I want because I'm the queen now in the Bible the things I'm going to say today it's not so much of preaching it's a little teaching and I want you to be attentive and listen if you read in the Book of Romans chapter 11 the Bible speaks about the Jews and the Gentiles and the Bible says you know the Jews were the original branch on Christ and they were cut off you know the reason why because of unbelief they refus to believe the gospel Christ came among them the Bible says he came among his own but his own received him nor so you see they kicked him away theyed and rejected him and when that happened you know the Bible says they were cut off amen but you see Christ cannot stay without branches he has to be full Christ cannot stay without a wife he must have a bride and so when he cut them off the Bible says he went in the forest in the wild and he picked another Branch out of the tree of the wild and hefted it Hallelujah do you know who that is that is the G church that is us until today the Jewish people do not believe Jesus they are blinded but the Bible says they were blinded for our sake amen their blindness is our blessing when they rejected Christ what did Christ do he rejected them and then what did he do he went and got another one and we are the one that now is virtuous we are now precious in His sight we are now precious in His sight you know when you read the book of Song of Solomon you will understand how precious we are the words that he flourishes on us he says my loved one oh you have d's eyes oh you are beautiful oh you are virtuous and many lovely words this is how Jesus sees me not because of what I have done not because of what I will do but listen because of his choosing of me do you know how Jesus expresses his love to his church how does he Express his love not by doing good things for you he will do the good things but that is not how Jesus expresses his love he expresses his love by choosing he or she that he loves many times you may even ask for good things he may or he may not give it to you but how do you know he loves you because he chose you in him before the foundation of the world the pcal they say that if you you are you are prospered it means God has favored you and he has loved you and if you are poor it means you are cast but we have other Prophet who has come and he said riches do not mean you are blessed you can have riches and still cast but you know even poverty does not mean you are cast you can be poor now but be rich tomorrow you see the Cloudy Skies you know the Cloudy Skies the heavy Skies bad life does not mean that God has cured you someone can someone can say what did I do things are not moving for and they go to some of these Deliverance pastors and they the way I see you have a cur and they they break the Cur they go to another church they break the Cur they go to another church and that cast will never be broken and indeed it can never be broken but let me tell what breaks the cast is by by receiving The Blessing of Abraham let me tell you Brothers Abraham was a blessed man and no one could C him and all his children can never be cast because his Blessing was from generation to generation to generation and who are we today who are we today we are the amen sons of Abraham amen by Faith by faith we are in the same lineage can I say we are blessed can I say I am blessed whether life is good or bad I am blessed and because I am blessed life must become good praise name of the Lord hallelujah and so we notic that Israel because they rejected Christ they were cut off and Christ came among the Gentiles and now the Gentiles are enjoying the blessings of the word and whenever wherever the word goes a blessings a blessing follows it wherever the word is received a blessing follows that place praise the name of the Lord and so friends we see here that Esther is a type of the Bride the Gentile bride we get into that now we see here King King AAS called for a visit King Jesus today has also called for a f and they gave them wine they drunk they drunk and everybody became drunk and they became very happy and the King was also very happy and when the king is Happy the first thing that came in his mind was I want to display the beauty of my queen and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation I like to run all over the place one I don't I don't I didn't wake up up in the neighborhood when the Lord showed me that stimulation of Revelation oil and wine in the Bible is associated together always in the Bible I got that in concerence here there is a starring of them where wine and oil goes together all the time when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed when it is revealed to his Saints amen the saints that are filled with oil they will all get stimulated wine is a stimulation Hallelujah stimulated with joy stimulated with shouts and when it does it has listen it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man now when you drink wine or alcohol you become stimulated you become happy have you ever seen a drunk man a drunk oh have you ever been a drunkard now you know how a drunkard is when you drunker a drunker doesn't have an enemy a drun has no bitterness alcohol takes everything away are you following me there's something I want to show you a drunkard is happy even when they were sad and depressed they take alcohol and then they begin to feel happy and they begin singing you see drunkards have their own song you can't sing it unless you are also drunk when you begin singing it without being drunk they will wonder what's wrong with with you but when you are drunk like themen you will sing the song you will have joy in your heart but you see the normal alcohol soon wees off and then you have [Applause] hangover and that's why Believers don't drink tell your neighbor that's why Believers we don't drink because that kind of alcohol wears off we want the kind that does not wear off hallelujah amen that will give us the same effect like a drunkard but this effect will never go away amen and he said what is that it says wine is talking about revelation you see the stimulation of Revelation let me tell you brother when the word of God is revealed to you when you have seen one God baptism in Jesus name Holiness when you've seen all these teachings in the Bible seven Church ages the order in the church you will see the confusion that other denominations are in and you you'll wonder how God loved you to give you that Revelation and it will excite you that's why when we hear the word we cannot be Idol as a dead log if you are like that it means you have no Revelation when the preacher is preaching you are hearing what he is saying but a person with Revelation he has more than what the preacher is saying when the preacher is preaching Revelation began begins to stimulate you more Revelation revelation after Revelation striking amen when I talk about the wife of jesusall someone say what's wrong with that person the preacher simply say say the wife of Jesus no but this person has had something else you are the wife of Jesus oh thank you Jesus foring and so when Revelation strikes you it will stimulate you amen when the Holy Ghost strikes you amen because the holy spirit is the oil wine and oil goes together wine and the oil goes together what is the oil the oil is the Holy Spirit what is wine Revelation so now when you receive the oil and then you receive the wine then you are stimul then you become drunk that's why we sing songs that the world cannot sing the world cannot sing that's why we sing songs we call them songs of Zion when I get happy I sing and I shout doesn't believe it I S I'm filled with the spirit there is no doubt and that is the matter with me one of them one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them one of them one of them are you so glad also I'm so glad that I can say Oh I thought I was the only one drunk there is power power Wonder working Power in the Blood of the Lamb am there is power power Wonder working power the most precious blood of the My God Is Not de is alive you know you are going through a problem but because you are drunk you don't remember your problem anymore amen hallelujah you begin to feel the joy that comes out of stimulation of the Revelation you have received of who you are and who God is to you my God is not dead he is alive my God is not dead he is alive my God is not dead he is alive and then they begin to see a big person behaving like a child I feel him in my hand I have him in my Fai and he what is wrong with that man the man is drunk the woman is Dr let me tell you brother when you get the revelation of the word you cannot remain flat you will be happy you will be joyful you cannot sleep in church something in you will shake you up a drunk cannot work normally a drunk walk stering why because alcohol is on his head am I still in the Bible am I still in the Bible yes on the day of Pentecost amen I saw some drunk people there amen Peter was one of them Mary the mother of Jesus was another and many of these other people when the Holy Ghost came down they got so drunk that they began staggering speaking in tongues and people say these ones are drunk they saw alcohol let me tell you when you receive this word andul your spirit the world will see you as an abnormal person if the world sees you as a normal person there is a problem with your Revelation but if your revelation is according to the world the world cannot receive you the way they receive others amen because you see things different hallelujah amen alcohol will make you see what is not there hallelujah amen hallelujah amen if at first you were wanting to beat your wife look at this bad woman but you see drink one more one time says my beauty come here come come come so beautiful why because you are drunk but you see the woman knows when alcohol wears off you will become a bad man again but when you take this this drink of revelation of the word you will always be a sweet man to your wife every time no matter what she has done you be telling oh my sweet wife that's why I always told you call your wife's sweet names even as long as you are drunk with this Revelation even if you're angry and she has done something and you're angry with her what is wrong with you sweetheart that sounds better that sounds better yes you will be tough what is wrong with you so people can't understand you what is wrong with this is he happy or is he sad but you see when you you call when you call those old things you know even if you are happy you will look as if you're fighting amen married couples areen mared CPL don't be quiet say Amen a big one that's right that's right that's right amen hallelujah amen but the sh you were quiet you need to shout a big amen yes sir find a name a sweet name you call your loved one you see [Music] darling flow Love's eyes my D you know my this my that as long as you're married of course those things are not not exclusive only for the married praise the Lord now when you are hry you call those things when you are happy you call those things because you know who you are the word amen has come and permeated through your entire life that's why Believers we don't beat our wives am I preaching to someone no no Believers we don't beat our wies how can you do that and you still claim to love her praise the Lord because we are stimulated with revelation amen Revelation has the same effect like has on a man because when the Revelation has been given of the truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that he makes him behave him self anomally praise the Lord and I want you to see the chamberline now drunk and all that and other people then he he sends the chamberline the the Chamberlin like Abal to go and send the King's Command and the the king sent the Chamberlin there were seven of them can you turn to the Book of Esther with me Revelation chapter 1 vers 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the King was Mary with wine he commanded Mechman bista Haba Biga and abaga Z carcass the the seven chamber lines that served in the presence of the aneras the king to bring V to the queen before the king with the Crown Royal to show the people and the princess her beauty for she was fair to look on now there is something I want to show you we just read Esther 1 10 up to 12 did you not that now I want you to see Revelation chapter one the same chapter the same verses Revelation 1 ver 10 to vers 12 very very amazing I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last what thou seest write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia andto Ephesus and and unto smana and unto pegamos andto th and unto sadis and unto Philadelphia and Ania and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks now I want you to see something interesting here okay you you because of time I know people who are following in luganda are reading for themselves okay now you see here in Revelation 1: 10 it is saying the same thing in Esther 1: 10 have you seen it saying the same thing here I see some of you have not got it let me exp here in the Book of Esther is speaking about seven chamber amen who are the seven chamber lines they were messengers of the king to go and call the Queen so the king had seven Chamberlin the king had seven amen Messengers and the Queen is the seven candlesticks Hallelujah do you have the picture brother you have the picture just give us the picture if you have amen will Vash follow the stars or she will refuse we can begin seeing it by you know the king sent seven Chamberlin seven Chamberlin are the Angels the Stars The Messengers and as they went toity said what did he say he said he wants you to come and display your beauty before everyone she said mm Go and tell him I have my own you know fist with my own women she was a rebellious woman she refused the word of The Messengers and when she rejected The Messengers she had automatically rejected the king are you following me Church These are types and shadows and now today who is V oh am I preaching to someone today who is verity Verity are the denominations they rejected the word they rejected baptism in Jesus name this is right here in the Bible they rejected the teaching on one God right in the Bible they rejected you know you know the true operation of the Holy Ghost in the church it is right here in the Bible the Bible says when you speak Tong interpret for them they said we don't care more than anyone when you begin to tell them about him stop we know drun the churches have rejected Jesus drun the most sick body is the church to know him more but they don't know him at all by rejecting The Messengers he has been sending they have been doomed forever and you know said I am sorry I'm sure long nails exactly this one must have seen a vision of and you know it looked like as if she would remove the eyes of these Messengers what are you trying to talk American English even without without being able to talk it tell the king I'm my own party has used men God is using men and God will always use men God is not about to go out of the business of using Men He will always so you might as well settle with it if you want to hear from God listen to the man of why I left imagine someone coming out why I left the chamber lines and why I am now the wife of the king you say you have a problem the Chamberlin and the king is the same thing can I hear shout am hallelujah hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen and so they rejected the king she rejected the king brother and the churches today have rejected him also and he is sad but what does he do he advis him said find yourself hey now I'm about to reach the CL of search for another wife a virous wife a wife that will submit herself to you a wife who will B Amen to every word you say search for another wife you are the king your word is amen when you speak it is done and if you say first is gone she's gone you can do anything you are The King and I want to say CH today Jesus is still King if these churches reject him denominations reject him even if they were supposed to be the true church he will divorce them know he came out God sent him out he was not sent by men he was not sent by himself he had authority of God it was God who sent him out Iranians was sent by God he was not in any church system who answered their histor Luther who was a Catholic priest are you still here Church Luther was a Catholic priest but when God sent him he rebelled against his church he said this church has gone away from the principles of the world there protest against my own denomination how can you sayar and all these kind of things and can you prayers how can you say I don't believe these things heed of the church listen church until we come to that [Music] level whereby we become a reel to everything but the word then there's a problem you church is the one that God used to begin and Kickstart the Reformation the Protestant movement he became a rebel let me become a rebel to the to the ordinances of man let me let me submit to the word of God hallelujah amen what is your religion ah I'm sorry if you find the religion of Jesus then you have found mine if you have found the religion of Peter then you found mine right there find the one of Paul mine is right there I know I believe what they believe I preach why they pre I live what they lived and you see Luther was also a man sent by God with the same thing William R same thing they were not bowing to any system of mind William Bram had a very big anointing many churches begged him come and join us they say you know why they wanted him to help them make money he refused he said I have to be faithful to my calling messenger that was sent to the church agents was not corrupt imagine saying here and you tell the king that I'm coming big would speak with others big would speak what the other ones have every chamberline was saying the same thing you see all these Church Messengers they all say the same thing not different and the Bible says in the book of Isaiah 4:1 and in the day in that day seven women shall take hold of one man and we they will say we will eat our bread and we will wear our own apparel only let us be called by thy name to take away our reproach imagine find Days Of The Voice Fellowship what we believe what we do what we stand for is against the Bible but we are claiming to be Christians that's where the church has reached and in the last days seven women they will hold on to one man but they will not allow him to provide anything so whether you like me or not I'm sent so whether you like me or not I'm sent I told you on WhatsApp today you are stuck with me so I'm sent how are you how are you how are you how are you is your life saying the same thing gives a story he says I got a clipping at home out of a newspaper you read it yourselves it said what's happened to the morals of our American [Music] women two out of every three soldiers was divorced by their wife wives that went overseas in the first six months two out of three was divorced these women just took off and ran out why is it if you understand friends it's the spirit of the time we have got to get in the spirit of the last days when the last days are here yes Friends when the times have come the times will enter the spirit of the end time and he says if you go to a dance hall hey you have to get in the spirit of dancing oh you want dance I've never been in a dance hall apart from church it's a very good church is a very good Dance Forever that's why you don't judge me when I dance in church because this is my dance hall amen but you see Church those who go to those dance halls he says they can't dance until they have to enter the spirit of the hall that's why to enter that Spirit they have to drink a little or they have to smoke or they have to get weed and they not really normal then they go there yeah man and then they put the music and they just there like zombies they begin dancing literally hell on [Music] Earth I am so glad Jesus redeemed me from that I am so glad Hallelujah I am one of those that are out of mess Hallelujah and he says if you go to the church you have to get into the spirit of worship before you cannot worship that's why when we come here you have to come here relaxed some of you are here you are not here that's why it is so hard sometimes for pastors to preach the pastor is rushing he spent the whole week preparing for you to hear from God and when you all now come many of you are not in the spirit of church even before the pastor begins preaching you are looking on your clock what time what time late it's late it's late if you want to hear from God if you come to church come to church remove all other programs imagine a person going to the dance he doesn't want even the phone he removes he he has already even taken his weed he doesn't want to be bothered he's just there the whole night and then he's drinking and then finally Falls you find them in the [Music] morning others they L drag them at home and then they would sleep the whole day why they were in the spirit of the dance Christians where are you wake up get before you come to church get into the spirit of church yes you listen you cannot make another program on Sunday no no if you have another appointment tell them I can't promise I'm going to church and they would ask you when will you come back whenever we are done with church but some of you Hallelujah you say come at one and when it one the word is going on Pastor finish Pastor finish Pastor if you are like that you can never receive anything from God and then when the p is about to finish you are very happy one quot already if you're off go away we want people who are in the spirit of the thing let me tell you we may be 50 or 100 or 20 as long as we are all in the spirit of the god is bound to visit us Miracles are bound to happen Hallelujah amen you have to enter the spirit of worship close yourself away from the world the world has to get in the spirit of the last days and that means the last days are here God has promised that these things would be here men and women are asleep and they don't realize it and you know he says it will continue to get worse and worse listen Church divorces will continue to happen yes it did not used to be this way I can authoritatively say 90% of all of you all of us are coming from broken homes even if our parents are living together they not happy they separated a long time ago others are bewitching each other others got other people in in their relationship others divorced others separated why it is the spirit of the age and the prophet said it will continue to get worse and worse Dives will continue to happen you see men these days boys are becoming girls no wonder they don't even want to work they are very lazy so in other words you have SS for men it used to be that a man would think this preach it now now this is the thing now you see listen to me Church men would think men would plan and men would make money men would take charge of their homes list men would protect their women take care of them stand through with them through sick but these days men are so weak until women are becoming men why do you think why do you single mothers are too many today why because men something something happen because the woman wants you to provide for her you're too fearful even for responsibility immediately you take off and you leave the mother with the children oh let me tell you it is going to continue getting worse and worse it is the spirit of the age it's a problem going on by the way until women have come to a place where they feel they cannot trust men anymore and they feel that whatever men can do they can do is because there's a problem with our men the devil has targeted men to destroy them to completely remove the backbone their backbone when men are destroyed then the generation is rued where are men that can take responsibility men that can provide for their homes men that can take control of their own family take care of their children love their wives genu protect their wies genuinely fight for them you know these days you know women men can't

see also the woman you are going to say don't worry me I just love you I can provide everything for myself men want women that can provide for themselves that is foolishness among a men if you are going to if you're looking for a wife and you're looking for someone to provide for you you have a problem listen I am normal I have have no problem listen it's only the spirit Ning on me to say the

man who lives there his home to God In Prayer the church the family to church takes the family to church leads the children to kneel down and pray are you hearing me disciplin the children when they error but these days even at schools when a child does something talking we believe in disciplining children father you can't see your children getting messed up and you just keep quiet WR whates that's laia laia is right we are not inia as the Believers we are in another age we are in the bright Age come out of her my people don't be partakers of our sin by the way that's why even women are storming the pulpits young men are fearing to stand for God they can't preach anymore they tell you to take the word and preach you can't why not because you have no gifts but because you're too sinful so you are condemned but let me tell you if you can live right take the word I started preaching when I was 13 once years old and let me tell you it was a very nervous experience when the spirit of God Came Upon me stood before the people now I knew I had to rebuke them teach to instu them let me tell you it doesn't matter how old somebody is no it doesn't matter see you can take the word and stand with it and preach it and live with it don't allow anyone to intimidate you no Bible colle should send Hallelujah you don't need any paper you need the Holy Ghost and a a life to the word if if you don't stop this then I'll C you no one can Cur you praise the Lord friends I want to come to a climax now and learn this place Hallelujah just give me a few more minutes now see I want to bring this subject into perspective of the king searching for a virtuous wife the king response was to divorce her you know we see that there was a house called a house of [Music] women I'm not now going to read I'm just going to go through these things chapter 2 verse 1 to 4 that's where I am now you see and there was a chamberline called he and so he was the chamberline of the House Of The Virgins of the women when all the virgins came before we get there I will tell you that the word went out the king is searching tell your neighbor the king is searching and word went out to every place in the kingdom it was a vast Empire the King was searching searching for virtuous God he was going to marry anything that cross his path he was going to marry a virtuous girl a God that can listen to every word of the king and so the women came very many of them virtuous girls and all came in that room in the house of of the women and it was manned by a chamberline called he and now the Bible says all these were Fair virgins yes beautiful and they came in the palace suan to of the women into the custody of the of he the Chamberlin the king chamberline virgin enough is not for you to see The King The King wanted a purified virtuous wife so you see they would go through the first six months they would be showered with bitter HS and then another six months Street HS and orders oh my God you know the Bible talks about I will not expand it but in the Book of Revelation it speaks about you know the the eating of the book so the chamberline he The Virgins received all the things for their purification praise the name of the Lord now I'm coming to a climax soon and really I'm not doing this justice but it's all right don't you worry don't be in a hurry let me be in a hurry you don't be in a hurry praise the name of the Lord this plane must land and land properly so don't hurry me I'm finishing I'm landing amen don't jump out because you may die just just stay with me amen and and you know they began to be purified purified purified the women The Virgins now here was a virgin Among The Virgins and when I read this it touched me by the way it moved my heart let me tell you God loves making a nobody somebody in the pal the Bible says there was a certain Jew whose name was M the son of J son of sh do you remember that name the son ofish benjamite do you remember do you remember when the king uh the King David was being Chas by his son abs and he went into the mountains you remember the man who came stoning him how many remember that man is name come on now what was the name you remember the name shim shim everybody say shim shim shim was the man sheim out you know he was from the family of King sa from The Tribe of Benjamin shim was not happy with David and you know shim came with curses and He was cursing David because he killed sa and the family of sa because was coming from the same family he was a relative so now listen Church M was a grandson of shim a grandson of shim that family of shim not a good family she cast The King by the way later on repented and the King forgave him but the king told his son this is the same same family that cast King David and you know you can't cast what God has blessed when C what God has blessed the cast comes on you so you might as well say sh was coming from a family that wasmer cast but that is where mod came from was a grandson of shim a of no bodies a family of the curers a family that was not accepted by God Som because it was rejected by God and soul but I want you to see that the Bible says is the man that brought upaa and you know because Esther you can say Esther was a cousin of M because because you see the Uncle of Modi was the father of Esther are you still following me we are trying to Le now we are approaching to land listen now not land but land displ my brother you miss it but it's all right let's continue so we see here as Esther was coming she came from a family of the rejects amen when I read this I broke down doesn't matter about my background if God is to favor me he will favor me no matter what my back is she was a nobody from a family of no bodies but was destined for greatness I know I'm listening and ra I'm talking to someone here today I believe it I know it that is destined for greatness not because I said it because we in the same anointing of Esther why Esther had something special about her something never heard like Mary Esther was favored the Bible says Esther was favored before all the Chamberlin I say we are greatly blessed and highly favored I am we have being put in the best place of the house the Bible says amen the chamberline amen found favor before and took Esther and separated Esther from the rest of the women they were all virgins but es was taken because of what and she was separated she was separated and taken in her different special Corner a special Corner a special Corner we are all Christians I tell you there is somewh a special woman a special Church a special bride we are taken in a different Corner hallelujah hallelujah yes we are receiving special [Applause] purification and the king is searching the king is searching but we are in the process we are in the process of meeting the king soon and very soon we are going to see the Hallelujah soon and very soon I believe es was in her corner and she was singing that song soon and very soon I am going to see that it doesn't matter my past it doesn't matter my uncle my father she was she was an orphan she was an orphan that that matter also who is an here it doesn't matter that too maybe your father abandon you and some of you get wounds and get sick and get disappointed and you feel I have nothing to this life but I have good news for you today it doesn't matter your past no it doesn't matter your past you are favored if you favor greatness is coming hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah even though you didn't get from your father that's not a matter when you get message Hallelujah glory to God when what is this message coming to do oh listen brother Julius hallelujah amen I don't even know why I say that amen when that messenger comes he comes to prepare you for greatness Hallelujah she was she was an orphan she was being taken care of by other people but God Was preparing her and I know something in Esther was saying one thing the king is searching that I have arrived I have arrived the king is searching but I who am I I know who I am I am the bride that is virtuous the king must choose meall other gods came and they were picking many things and they were asked as they went out of the house of at the house of the wom do you want something else to be able to see the king with maybe she would say yes I need some lipstick then so that when the king sees my lips he will melt maybe one of them would have said apart from the purification I received I need something else give me some high heels because I'm a little short I want to walk so that I would be as tall as a horse [Music] and please give me a mini SC so I can attract my king and those long long long earrings many of them might have said that but as they came before The King was [Music] but then the time for eser came hallelujah amen the time fora came they asked her what would you like anything extra she said everything the chamberline gave me is [Applause] enough in other words Hallelujah the message from messenger is enough in other words I have heard Malachi 4 I have heard Revelation 107 it is enough hallelujah hallelujah when I received this I received the oil and when I received this I receive the wine Hallelujah I am stimulated fire all I want to see is the king let me tell you brother sister the message is enough hallelujah amen this message PES away for you to be filled with the Holy Ghost that Jesus died it is enough he died for me all that because of the message it is enough my works are nothing no I need it it is enough was told okay if you say so you can go thank you that is all I was waiting for oh I want to say God loves taking nothing and making it something by the way by the authority of the word of God I want to say some many of you here under this ministry submitting yourself to the word every day Allowing God to change you every day it doesn't matter your condition or your situation God is going to change you from nothing to something it may take 12 months of purification but something is happening hallelujah how many can say I hear it I feel it I see it I can feel it something is happening something is taking place and soon I will see it with my own [Applause] eyes hallelu literally there was no hope for but if you are nothing and have no hope at life I have good news for you today the
