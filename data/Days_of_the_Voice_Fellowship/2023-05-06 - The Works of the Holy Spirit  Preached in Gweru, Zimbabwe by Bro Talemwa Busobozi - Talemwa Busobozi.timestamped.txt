[1:34:48] amen amen
[1:34:50] um I'd like to uh thank Pastor Syed for
[1:34:54] the invitation to come and be with you
[1:34:55] here
[1:34:58] he said very powerful words which I
[1:35:01] don't think
[1:35:04] but I I Pastor said has a powerful
[1:35:07] Ministry
[1:35:09] he shook us up when he came to Kampala
[1:35:13] we really enjoyed that and I tell you
[1:35:17] many people were filled with the Holy
[1:35:18] Spirit
[1:35:23] so I'm so glad to be identified with
[1:35:26] such a Ministry
[1:35:29] amen amen and so you see I've lost half
[1:35:33] of my voice
[1:35:36] I was just telling past aside
[1:35:39] you know he he gave me up and they
[1:35:42] squeezed all everything out of me
[1:35:45] you know like he said we came and we've
[1:35:49] been last weekend we were in South
[1:35:51] Africa
[1:35:54] and we had to uh two meetings there
[1:35:59] then we've been at Highlands
[1:36:01] and also at uh
[1:36:05] also
[1:36:07] and and so it seems like it's been two
[1:36:11] weeks of ministry in Zimbabwe
[1:36:29] [Music]
[1:36:36] [Music]
[1:37:09] blessed us myself and Rebecca together
[1:37:14] I've been preaching this message by God
[1:37:16] is great for 17 years now
[1:37:21] and I've been married for 10 years
[1:37:23] as you can see I'm just starting out in
[1:37:26] life
[1:37:28] and I'm glad that I'm starting out with
[1:37:30] the message
[1:37:32] there is no life anywhere else
[1:37:35] I thought I was going to be a reverend
[1:37:38] priest
[1:37:40] my father was a priest
[1:37:43] but somehow God you know caught me and
[1:37:46] pulled me out of that message
[1:37:48] you know anything else out of the
[1:37:51] message
[1:37:57] and he has brought us in this message so
[1:38:00] that we can be prepared for the Rapture
[1:38:03] so this is a holy ghost message
[1:38:06] do you believe that and so we are all
[1:38:09] being prepared I might be from Uganda
[1:38:14] but we are all children of the same
[1:38:16] family
[1:38:24] let us sing it's the all-time Holy

[1:44:33] word right away and we're going to read
[1:44:36] John chapter 14. 14.
[1:44:40] 7
[1:44:49] it was very cold in Johannesburg but it
[1:44:52] is it is very hot yes it is at home so
[1:44:56] who knows
[1:44:58] so I feel at home now
[1:45:03] amen amen we are reading verses 7.7
[1:45:11] we'll read up to verses
[1:45:13] 11.11 if he had known me
[1:45:18] you should have known my father also and
[1:45:21] and from henceforth you know him and
[1:45:23] have seen him
[1:45:27] and Philip said unto him Lord show us
[1:45:30] the father and it's sufficients
[1:45:35] Jesus said unto him have I been so long
[1:45:38] a time with you and yet has to thou not
[1:45:40] known me Philip he that has seen me has
[1:45:44] seen the father and how says Thou then
[1:45:46] show us the father Jesus
[1:45:59] thou know that I am in the father and
[1:46:02] the father in me the word that I speak
[1:46:04] unto you I speak not on myself but the
[1:46:07] father that dwareth in me he doeth the
[1:46:09] works
[1:46:20] believe me that I am in the father
[1:46:24] and the father in me
[1:46:26] or else believe me for the very wax sick
[1:46:33] let us pray kind Heavenly Father we want
[1:46:38] to commit ourselves now to you as we are
[1:46:40] going to sit down and listen in to what
[1:46:44] the Holy Spirit has for us father we are
[1:46:46] ready to hear from you we desire to hear
[1:46:49] from you we are expectant Lord for what
[1:46:50] you're going to do Lord we give
[1:46:52] ourselves to you now in Jesus name we
[1:46:54] pray amen you may be seated amen
[1:46:58] so you know while I was reading this uh
[1:47:02] portion of scripture
[1:47:04] I noticed there is one portion that
[1:47:07] Jesus never said
[1:47:10] because it wasn't the time yet I wanted
[1:47:13] to read it again where he says verse 11.
[1:47:16] believe me that I am in the father
[1:47:19] and the father in me there is another
[1:47:23] portion there that street
[1:47:25] the father is in me I am in the father
[1:47:29] and I am in you
[1:47:32] that person came later on
[1:47:37] right here as they were laboring to know
[1:47:39] who Jesus was
[1:47:42] speaking on a pre-rupture conditions
[1:47:49] the words
[1:47:52] of the Holy Spirit The Works of the holy
[1:47:56] spirit so he yeah they were trying to
[1:47:59] labor to find out who Jesus was
[1:48:02] and and you know Philip comes and asks
[1:48:06] him a direct question
[1:48:08] he said we are tired of this confusion
[1:48:12] sometimes you speak as the father
[1:48:15] and sometimes we speak as the sons
[1:48:18] I tell you this is one of the things
[1:48:23] before I came to the message and maybe
[1:48:26] there is somebody here that might be
[1:48:28] confused by the godhead
[1:48:32] that whatever you read in the Bible
[1:48:34] you see a war not like he there is a
[1:48:37] father
[1:48:39] there is a God in heaven and again there
[1:48:43] is another God here
[1:48:47] so how many gods do we have
[1:48:50] but I'm here to tell you we have one God
[1:48:53] and if you can't explain it is
[1:48:58] oh
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:50:14] um
[1:50:15] and he remembered in the Old Testament
[1:50:18] when the prophet of God
[1:50:20] prayed and he said oh God
[1:50:23] Open the Eyes of the young man
[1:50:28] that those that be with us
[1:50:33] and in a
[1:50:37] moments
[1:50:44] around them
[1:50:47] maybe Philip knew that scripture
[1:50:50] he respected Jesus
[1:50:59] but Jesus did not do that yes Jesus
[1:51:03] stand to feel it
[1:51:04] Hallelujah
[1:51:07] Philip Philip have I been with you
[1:51:11] Philip said show me show us the father
[1:51:25] [Applause]
[1:51:32] [Applause]
[1:51:37] you have seen the father
[1:51:46] [Music]
[1:52:04] [Music]
[1:52:06] and the father is in me
[1:52:09] [Music]
[1:52:10] the words I speak I speak not of myself
[1:52:18] hallelujah amen and then he says
[1:52:25] [Music]
[1:52:27] he realized it is still difficult for
[1:52:29] him
[1:52:31] to understand he said all right all
[1:52:34] right let me bring it down
[1:52:37] if you don't believe my word
[1:52:40] if it is
[1:52:54] how long have you been in the message
[1:52:57] for five years
[1:53:00] and you are still confused
[1:53:04] they have something that will take all
[1:53:08] your doubts away
[1:53:10] he says believe the very words
[1:53:14] Hallelujah if there is something the
[1:53:17] devil cannot describe
[1:53:23] Hallelujah because then it is not just a
[1:53:26] talk
[1:53:27] and it is not just words it is
[1:53:35] God coming down
[1:53:41] and you know the only way we can be able
[1:53:43] to recognize Christ
[1:53:48] Jesus was a man but the words he did
[1:53:57] the works of Jesus
[1:54:04] God was vindicating him
[1:54:07] through the works of the Holy Ghost
[1:54:27] [Music]
[1:55:02] very early in the morning
[1:55:06] and I saw that my father was poisoned
[1:55:11] he's a black man
[1:55:13] um
[1:55:14] you say he's a black man all right he's
[1:55:16] a black man but
[1:55:19] dark skinned okay
[1:55:21] but I saw that his skin was so dark
[1:55:24] because of the poison
[1:55:27] now if a black man was becoming dark
[1:55:31] I know it was really real
[1:55:35] so in that trance
[1:55:38] I saw that he was poisoned
[1:55:41] and that I needed to pray for him
[1:55:45] and that the place where that if he does
[1:55:49] not if he changes his mind that he does
[1:55:51] not go to the place where he was
[1:55:52] planning to go
[1:55:56] he would survive the poison
[1:56:00] I got my phone and called him very early
[1:56:03] in the morning
[1:56:05] and I told him father are you okay
[1:56:08] he said sure yes I am I told him now I'm
[1:56:12] speaking to you these are not my words
[1:56:15] of the Holy Spirit
[1:56:17] you know by the time I
[1:56:49] late evening
[1:57:29] [Music]
[1:57:49] I said what is happening
[1:58:04] [Music]
[1:58:36] [Applause]
[1:58:51] foreign and when I went to the church we
[1:58:54] had the service at the whole time I was
[1:58:58] praying that the pastor finish us to
[1:59:00] preach so I can pray dancing
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:08] let me tell you we should always come to
[1:59:10] church
[1:59:13] will come in that condition but God who
[1:59:17] can use that word
[1:59:25] and so as as uh you know we went into
[1:59:28] prayer
[1:59:29] I like prayed my heart out
[1:59:32] I won't cry to the Lord
[1:59:35] and then friends
[1:59:38] Hallelujah after two hours when I went
[1:59:42] outside
[1:59:43] it seemed as if he was waiting for me to
[1:59:46] get to get outside
[1:59:48] he called me and he said
[2:00:06] [Applause]
[2:00:50] foreign
[2:01:10] [Applause]
[2:01:15] Jesus Christ
[2:01:20] [Applause]
[2:01:26] and so here it is
[2:01:28] John also wanted to find vindications
[2:01:37] when John saw Jesus
[2:01:43] and he introduced Jesus Christ
[2:01:46] as the Lamb of God
[2:01:51] but after a moment
[2:02:09] [Music]
[2:02:11] and we tend to forget what our God can
[2:02:14] do
[2:02:18] but I want you to see here
[2:02:20] John in John Luke 7 19 Luke 7 7 Panama
[2:02:26] 19. oh my oh man let's be a little bit
[2:02:28] fast and I say John calling unto him two
[2:02:31] of his disciples sent them to Jesus
[2:02:33] saying
[2:02:36] he that should come here
[2:02:40] all look we foreign

[2:07:43] looking around

[2:08:31] and I was first with a challenge
[2:08:35] that this was the first as far as we
[2:08:38] knew at the time the first message
[2:08:40] Church in the country
[2:08:46] has 100 more than 120 million people
[2:08:49] Ethiopia universe
[2:08:54] 80 million
[2:08:56] 18 18 18
[2:08:58] times smaller
[2:09:02] one oh my good Lord in Uganda we have 40
[2:09:05] 40 something 40 million 40 something and
[2:09:08] and so in ethical they have 120 Minutes
[2:09:13] 120 million and so there was no other
[2:09:16] message
[2:09:18] the message you went to Ethiopia just
[2:09:21] recently married
[2:09:24] about 10 years ago
[2:09:26] and we have our fellowship
[2:09:33] a few young boys
[2:09:37] maybe we had about 10 or less
[2:09:42] and they were all not married
[2:09:45] and now if they don't find a wife from
[2:09:48] among themselves what are they going to
[2:09:49] do
[2:09:51] so I was faced with a challenge
[2:09:54] I went back to the message
[2:10:08] and I was very busy feeling so bad about
[2:10:11] the circumstances
[2:10:14] maybe God will understand
[2:10:21] Believers from here for them to marry or
[2:10:24] choose
[2:10:25] so what are we going to do so when the
[2:10:29] young man kept on asking me
[2:10:32] what about marriage
[2:10:34] what does the prophet say about marriage
[2:10:37] I kept on saying what the prophet says
[2:10:41] hallelujah
[2:10:44] how
[2:11:29] [Music]
[2:12:10] [Music]
[2:12:33] [Applause]
[2:12:42] several people from
[2:13:39] [Applause]
[2:13:41] I've opened my eyes
[2:13:48] [Applause]
[2:13:50] hallelujah amen and that young lady is
[2:13:55] now supporting him uh and they're the
[2:13:58] pastors of the church
[2:14:00] and I'm here to encourage you that
[2:14:03] everything you need
[2:14:05] is in the message
[2:14:08] there is nothing more
[2:14:11] that we need out there
[2:14:14] Hallelujah no matter your situation no
[2:14:18] matter what you are going through
[2:14:19] everything is in the message
[2:14:22] and so John the Baptist said go and ask
[2:14:27] him should we wait for another
[2:14:31] yeah
[2:14:32] and in the same hour
[2:14:36] in the same hour
[2:14:37] Jesus cured many informities yes
[2:15:05] [Applause]
[2:15:25] now I'm imagining
[2:15:28] when Jesus came
[2:15:30] and met these people
[2:15:33] from a man who had received doubts
[2:15:38] about his ministry
[2:15:41] Jesus had many options
[2:15:47] to confirm his ministry to be regardless
[2:15:51] Ministry
[2:15:52] maybe he would have sat them down and he
[2:15:56] gave them a little gospel spanking
[2:15:58] and preach to them a sermon of one hour
[2:16:02] maybe he would have sat down with them
[2:16:04] and debated with them over back and
[2:16:07] forth
[2:16:09] maybe he would have told them something
[2:16:12] that would have opened their eyes
[2:16:18] maybe would have opened in the prophets
[2:16:23] the courts of Isaiah
[2:16:29] the courts of Jeremiah and he would tell
[2:16:33] them you see this quote here he's
[2:16:36] talking about me
[2:16:38] Jesus did not do that what did he do ah
[2:17:29] [Applause]
[2:18:01] imagine where God begins to manifest
[2:18:06] himself in the body of believers
[2:18:10] foreign
[2:18:56] when Jesus was upon the Earth he said
[2:19:01] know that I am in the father and the
[2:19:03] father in me in the words that I speak
[2:19:05] unto you I speak not of myself but a
[2:19:07] father that dwareth in me
[2:19:13] and notice these will not be the works
[2:19:16] we shall do
[2:19:18] you know you are not saved because of
[2:19:20] what you did
[2:19:22] and therefore nothing that you will do
[2:19:24] yeah
[2:19:27] it's going to be his Works
[2:19:31] notice I said the works of the holy
[2:19:33] spirit it's going to be the works of the
[2:19:35] Holy Spirit
[2:19:40] John 14 10 he says here it is most
[2:19:42] evident set forth you know this is
[2:19:45] that the perfect manifestation of God in
[2:19:48] the sun was by the indwelling spirit
[2:19:51] manifesting in word and works
[2:19:59] that is exactly what we have been
[2:20:02] teaching all along
[2:20:06] how many believe that
[2:20:08] when the bride will get back to being a
[2:20:11] white bride
[2:20:14] let me first post there
[2:20:17] and I want to ask you a question
[2:20:21] do we have a word Bride In Our
[2:20:23] Generation
[2:20:26] do we have a white bride or we don't
[2:20:28] know
[2:20:31] the bride that is made ready
[2:20:36] we have received the word in our
[2:20:38] generation
[2:20:43] [Applause]
[2:20:52] [Applause]
[2:21:04] [Applause]
[2:21:40] she will produce the very work foreign
[2:21:55] let me tell you
[2:21:57] we talk about the third pool
[2:22:00] we've had so many people say
[2:22:02] and indeed they quoted like brother
[2:22:04] Barnum says
[2:22:06] now it's manifested but not in fullness
[2:22:10] we're waiting for that moment
[2:22:16] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[2:22:18] and forever
[2:22:36] you know that kind of gospel keeping us
[2:22:38] waiting wait wait it's coming it is
[2:22:40] coming
[2:22:42] I want to say this yeah
[2:22:45] this is the time we are the people
[2:22:49] must produce
[2:22:54] hallelujah amen we are the people that
[2:22:57] must produce those words
[2:23:05] this is the pre-rapture conditions
[2:23:19] maybe I'll go maybe I don't know I'm
[2:23:21] foreign
[2:23:38] [Applause]
[2:23:55] [Applause]
[2:24:27] and begin to do the works
[2:24:30] the spirit is God the word is God where
[2:24:34] the spirit is God the word is God
[2:24:39] they are all one they say one cannot
[2:24:43] walk apart from the other
[2:24:44] um
[2:24:51] we can't have the word and have not and
[2:24:53] don't have the spirit
[2:24:54] [Music]
[2:24:57] if if one truly has the spirit of God
[2:25:02] he will have the word of God
[2:25:04] that is how it was with the prophet they
[2:25:08] had the indwelling spirit of God
[2:25:11] and the word came to them
[2:25:14] praise the name of the Lord
[2:25:18] age
[2:25:21] he says now we are at the end of this
[2:25:24] time
[2:25:26] each man has looked at the end of his
[2:25:28] Junction for the coming of Christ
[2:25:32] [Music]
[2:25:33] but they had a look to the uh they had a
[2:25:36] lot to look forward to
[2:25:39] the returning of the Jews the flying
[2:25:43] saucers in the skies and all those
[2:25:45] things that we see today
[2:25:47] but we are at the end time
[2:25:50] we are here now by the way the reason
[2:25:54] why I love the message is the message
[2:25:56] reveals things at the world even the
[2:25:58] world doesn't know about it
[2:26:04] and he says those are investigating
[2:26:06] angels
[2:26:34] they know the church was to receive the
[2:26:36] the power that would work in the church
[2:26:39] the same works of Christ
[2:26:44] because as the shadow becomes deeper and
[2:26:47] deeper
[2:26:49] foreign
[2:26:55] [Applause]
[2:26:59] after a while the shed gets closer and
[2:27:02] closer
[2:27:07] and the shed is the same thing
[2:27:14] and that time is now
[2:27:17] when Christ and the bride must become
[2:27:20] one
[2:27:22] now the spirit of God has worked under
[2:27:24] justification sanctification
[2:27:35] [Music]
[2:27:36] because you know performing and doing
[2:27:39] the very same things
[2:27:44] what is it the church and Christ have
[2:27:47] become
[2:27:50] do you know what happened
[2:27:57] foreign
[2:28:39] [Applause]
[2:28:50] foreign
[2:28:59] [Applause]
[2:29:08] and the branch Bears record of the vine
[2:29:13] because it draws its energy and life
[2:29:16] from The Vines
[2:29:20] the first branch
[2:29:23] that came from this
[2:29:27] vinegar he says they wrote a book of
[2:29:31] Acts behind them
[2:29:36] we see the way the Holy Spirit acted in
[2:29:41] that first chapter
[2:29:47] and then we believe that if this
[2:29:51] original vine
[2:30:05] why because it's the same life
[2:30:12] it's not going to be a trial and error
[2:30:16] when we talk about speaking in tongues
[2:30:18] for instance
[2:30:20] it's not going to be the ministers
[2:30:23] teaching the people how to speak times
[2:30:32] like it was in the original you will
[2:30:35] have tanks and interpretation of times
[2:30:46] sickness has dropped
[2:30:55] writing a book of Acts behind it
[2:30:59] and when I say it's not us going to
[2:31:01] manufacture it
[2:31:03] this reminds me I'll give this testimony
[2:31:08] I'm in the church
[2:31:10] this sisters helped support the work of
[2:31:12] God
[2:31:14] ever since we went to Ethiopia
[2:31:17] and now things look like she's reached
[2:31:20] the end and she's not receiving a
[2:31:22] breakthrough
[2:31:24] people and she comes to the options
[2:31:27] she's crying
[2:31:28] Pastor what can I do
[2:31:30] now I looked at her and she was crying
[2:31:34] you know you cannot hug a sister
[2:31:40] you can't do that so I feel sorry for
[2:31:43] her
[2:31:48] and then right there and then the
[2:31:51] anointing of the Holy Spirit comes
[2:31:53] let me tell you church it's one thing to
[2:31:56] know the word
[2:32:13] [Applause]
[2:32:28] you know the Holy Spirit was revealing
[2:32:31] things about her life
[2:32:43] [Music]
[2:32:57] she handed it over to the boss
[2:33:00] and the boss went through it
[2:33:02] and he was so happy
[2:33:05] report
[2:33:07] I said you are the best
[2:33:10] she said she started bragging she said
[2:33:13] would you also like me to take over the
[2:33:15] one of the headquarters
[2:33:18] and this was a big company
[2:33:21] and this is I didn't even have a degree
[2:33:25] he didn't even have a diploma
[2:33:27] so I came out of the vision
[2:33:30] and I the anointing came on me and I
[2:33:32] said
[2:33:34] you are going to get a job in a big
[2:33:37] company if it doesn't happen then it is
[2:33:41] not the Lord spoke but it is
[2:33:50] he took exactly two weeks
[2:33:56] there was a big company like uh
[2:33:59] like Western Union
[2:34:01] that needed a representative in the
[2:34:04] country
[2:34:06] and then but they needed someone who had
[2:34:08] the credentials
[2:34:10] and somebody who also had good English
[2:34:15] but this sister did not have the
[2:34:18] credentials but she had a good English
[2:34:21] and she had always helped us
[2:34:29] and God used
[2:34:41] [Applause]
[2:35:03] [Applause]
[2:35:19] [Applause]
[2:35:29] foreign
[2:35:39] [Applause]
[2:35:52] today and forever

[2:35:59] the best
[2:36:00] for several years and I'm telling you
[2:36:04] that same God
