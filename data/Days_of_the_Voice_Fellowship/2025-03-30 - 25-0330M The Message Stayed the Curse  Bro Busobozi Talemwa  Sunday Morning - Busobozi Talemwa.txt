Lord, we ask that you'll come and speak and let your word come with boldness and conviction, Lord. We will hear from heaven. We will hear from you, Lord. Father, have your way in this both here and those uh that are joining us by the way of the internet. Minister to every need. I pray in Jesus name. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Uh while you're still standing, also joined to welcome Sir Fiona Aqua from [Applause] Wow. Right over there. God bless you so much. Thank you so much for coming to fellowship with us this morning. May the Lord grant the desires of your heart. So um uh we are so glad that we are in the house of the Lord today and that he he's done great things. Amen. Has he done great things for you? Amen. Uh we're going to turn to Malachi 4. And while you are turning there, I just want to um to to ask you to join me to welcome uh Mr. and Mrs. Brother Emma. [Music] You do not know them but could you come this side? Amen. Brother Emmanuel and this is his wife. Uh they've joined us now. It's about three weeks, right? So um as soon as they had joined us, brother Emma had an accident. Some of you we announced and you prayed for you and u and brother Emma is also a minister of the gospel. Uh brother Emma the sermon you preached on Thursday for those who don't know and for you you don't know also. We posted it on the group of the church and and people who listen one of them was brother poly brother poly cup. Oh brother Emma you missed on Friday night here. How many enjoyed that sermon? Brother was really wonderful but he picked his inspiration from what you prepared. You know the body is you know we are all parts of the same body and we bless one another. So we are so thankful for to God for brother Emma and his wife whenever the fellowship we went to um in I think about twice they're newly married about twice they have invited us to their home and sister cooked very delicious meals for us. I I I really appre she's a pastor's daughter but then married to a minister. So let us welcome brother Emma and his wife. Well God bless you brother Emanuel. Thank you so much and we certainly appreciate you and um we know that the saints in will be blessed by his ministry. He ministers there. Brother Shem ministers there. Brother Julius ministers there. And I don't know who else. But these brothers are really doing a good work. As you know, is just coming up. There is much more work to do for the Lord. And we're just looking forward for him to use us. Amen. Amen. So the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord. I I I believe that all of you are here. You are not here by accident. Even me, I'm not here by accident. It is God's leadership. And so, brother Emma, God is leading you. And uh we just look forward to what he has in store. also brother um I'm forgetting the name now from cases God bless you so much thank you for coming to fellowship with us shall we open in the book of Malachi 4 5 I'm not enjoying my sound brothers Malachi 4 this is a typical scripture Most of us have read it. How many know the scripture? How many can quote it without reading it? Malachi 4:5-6. Can we read it without reading it? Behold, brother Marvin has spoiled it. I wanted to see those who can read it without reading. Let's read it anyhow. Behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and the dreadful day of the Lord. and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse. So in other words, he would curse the world. He would cast the earth if the Elijah's ministry does not come on. Is that a proper interpretation? If Elijah doesn't come, the earth will be cut. Meaning the coming of Elijah will bring a message which will stare the curse. So I'm preaching on the message will stay the cast. Amen. The message stayed the curse. You may be seated. Amen. The message stayed the curse. Uh tell your neighbor the message stayed the curse. Praise the Lord. Um we have limited time because we have a full day. uh we have a ministers meeting afterwards after that we shall be having the service in in so um we just go into the word right away how many are ready for the word ask your neighbor you ready for the word well those of you visiting us the first time this is days of the voice fellowship days of the voice fellowship. My name is Pastor. Yeah, we have no law but love, no membership but fellowship. And um you know that's what differentiates us from all the denominations. We are here to have fellowship. We welcome every denomination. We welcome anybody and everybody. And uh whenever you come here, just feel at home. Let the Holy Spirit speak to you and relax yourself in his presence. And uh let us see what he has for us. S Rose, nice to see you. Not I've not seen you for the past three, four weeks. Amen. It's always it's always good to um see one another in the house of the Lord. You are not responding. Amen. Well, well, behold, I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of my head is going in circles because there are many ways I can approach this. But I just certainly want to follow what the Holy Spirit um will tell us this morning. Amen. Amen. The Elijah ministry is promised to come before the coming of the Lord. How many believe that? Is it in the Bible? Do we believe it? Do you believe it? It's a promise. It was promised to come before the Lord comes. I want us to understand that the Elijah ministry is very important because of the message Elijah carries. It is so it is so essential because the world would certainly be under a curse because you see Elijah ministry comes to restore back to to restore the world back to God to restore the world back to Jesus as savior and it's only that salvation. It's only that savior. It's only that blood that can stay the curse. The world is cast. And this morning, I'm going to speak on very uh very important things. I I pray that you give me your hand. Divide that. If you can stay in without moving back and forth, I'll really appreciate. Amen. and try to be stationary as much as possible. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. We are talking about today is not I wouldn't want to call so much of a preaching on Sundays. I noticed there are many people who don't want to fellowship on weekdays and they are here on Sunday. Well, of course, some are visitors, but also many are church members who are too busy. And so, I noticed when you come on Sunday morning, I shouldn't just give you a little sweet. I should give you real food, real boro and beans that then will help you to grow. So usually on Sunday I need you to be very and I hope that some some of you brethren can stop uh being Sunday mail you know there's a paper I think in the UK or whatever it is called Sunday mail they only print it on Sunday so it is read and bought on Some Christians are Sunday mail. You will never see them in church but only on Sunday. But may you never be Sunday men. May you be ready every day. The Bible says we are written a piece red of all men. So we should do always attend church. So on Sunday when I have all of you, I want to soil myself in the word. How many are ready for that? So prepare your mind to take in much. That doesn't mean I'll be so long. But just stay your mind together with me. So it is essential. The Elijah ministry is very important. When I first came into the message, I used to ask myself question like why do the preachers always say brother Bam say why do they always quote brother Brham who is this brother Brham and later on I learned he was a man who would fulfill that prophecy of the coming of the so then I said so But because we have Jesus, we have the Bible, we have the Holy Spirit. So why should we really be so much concerned about the Elijah ministry? Anyone here with such questions? Well, don't lift up your hand because some may mark you. I can tell you it is good to be honest. It is good to ask when you want to know. And when you are concerned, you will get into the word and study it. So this morning, I'm praying that some of of your questions will be met and that the Lord will minister to your heart. So the message, why what is the message? The message I I think I'm having problems with the microphone here. I don't know which one I should use because this one is on and off, brethren. So the the message uh what is the message exactly? The message is the voice of God through a prophet to a people. It doesn't have to be William Brham. Even what I'm preaching to you this morning is a message. So anyone who God has sent is preaching a message. But there are many preachers in every generation. And all these preachers will preach a message. But there is always one prophet in the generation. And that prophet will always preach the message. I'll give you many examples. You know, we had there was a time in the whole world when God sent one prophet to the whole world and his name was Noah. Noah had the message. He does. You know, I want you to imagine the whole wide world, no all the continents that we know of, they had to listen to the message of one man. Is that realistic? Is it realistic? You're not sure, but as far as I'm concerned, it does not sound too [Music] realistic. Imagine to say that God has sent me, I'm the only preacher for the whole world. You will tell me, "Yeah, pastor, Are you sure it was God who sent you? Not to say I'm not a preacher, but you will have many many questions answered. You mean your message will go in all continents of the world. You It will even go up to Greenland, Antarctica. Antarctica. It will go in all these areas. Australia, America, Canada, you know, all the way to all Africa. to Europe, all these places, Asia and my message has to go to all those places. I can now tell you my message me as me is not meant to go to all those places but it is meant to come to you local. So in every generation, God has local ministers, local prophets, people he will anoint to preach to countries, to to areas, to to churches, you know, portions of people here and there, you know, and some have bigger ministries than others. God has given me grace to go to Ethiopia, send a message there and then I was their messenger to bring them the message and then here also and maybe go a few countries here and there but that is an isolated ministry a very small ministry and there are many preachers like that and there are others with bigger ministry and God will use them to speak to nations but See, according to Bible prophecy, there are ministries that God sends to the whole world. And that one man, God trusts him so much that he sends him to speak to the whole world. I want you to imagine how big that response is. People like Noah, his message was not for his place. His message was not for his town or his country. The message of Noah was for the entire world including Uganda. Uganda and the message was it is going to rain. The message was it is going to rain and if you don't enter my boat, you are all going to be destroyed. Anyone who refused to believe that message under the curse, they were going to die because that message was the only thing that could stay the curse. How many were saved that day? Only eight people including the messenger. There were many people who were wise. They built their own boats. Maybe if there was CNN, they made big news trying to show how foolish Noah is. How foolish the people are that are following him. But how can a man say, he only has a message and his message is the only truth and everybody else should leave whatever they believing and follow him. Isn't this ridiculous? and and he is saying that the whole world is going to drown. And then they they went into this kind of things of checking uh you know the water and according to the science of that time. They could not see any evidence that it was going to rain. But God had spoken to his son and he had told him it was going to rain. It was up to the people to believe it or refuse it. But when God sends a man, his message cannot fail. Men will try to say anything they want. But his message is not for everyone. His message is meant for a group of people that were meant to believe it and accept it. And Noah preached and preached and preached and finally some people believed the message and they entered the ark and then as they were still in the ark the doors were shut. It started raining and they were like ah this man was a right man. Should we first please don't worry we have our own thoughts. And when the airs began capsizing that's why they oh we need the other one let us go in we have a lot of technology we have a way we can jump in it work it never worked God closed the door when the door is closed no one can enter and even in this generation we have a message And this is a message of grace. This is the only message which will stay the car. But there are many people playing with this message, ridiculing and speaking whatever they want to say. But let me tell you brother one of these days the door is going to shut. And when the door shuts they will begin waking up. And those the ones who are going to be feeling terrible, they are the ones who had come into the message and went out. You know how many people came into the ark when Noah was building. How many remember? Very many people came in, right? They came and helped Noah to build and as they were waiting seven days they would go 10 one year. There is nothing here. It is all fake. They are repeating the same message over and over. They keep quoting what their prophet told them. They keep quoting it as if to say it will help. It will bring the rain down. They keep quoting. They are tired of that. Even in our churches, we can enjoy better preaching. We can hear better things. Let's go back. And they went back and and apostle Paul said they went back from they went out of us because they were not a part of us. Whoever is a part of this message cannot leave the message. I cannot leave myself. I am the message. Amen. I am the message. Why? I'll show it to you here. So you see, I cannot leave myself. But when they leave, it is because they never knew what it was. They were make believers. We preach here about make believers. Make believers are very dangerous. They will stay for a while. They will look for mistakes. They will point out mistakes and then after a long time they will leave. An unbeliever doesn't even stay for a day. But I a make a believer will stay long enough until you think he's one of you and then he will leave. That's why sometimes you know people pressure me or excommunicate. Some people don't even want to waste my time excommunicating. They have already showed their true colors and you show your true color by standing with the word and those who live. They will be very quick to point mistakes, mistakes in the mistakes in the believers, mistakes in the church, problems in the church. Who told you that believers of this message don't have mistakes? The reason why we are believers is because we have many mistakes, many errors, many troubles. And that's why we are believers. Why? Because we know one thing. We do not have any power within us to overcome. There's something in this message which is changing our life every day. And that is why we are here because we want to be changed. We want to overcome the world. We want to be in the boat. to be in the message so we can go in the rapture outside of this message. It is a curse. So today I want us to get into that and Noah later on it came and drained and and the people remembered when it was too late. I I I don't know how he looked at them. We shall look at those brethren. We are in our among us playing around when the rapture has gone. Do you know they will be the most serious in the tribulation? They will come in our churches because we have left it for them. They will hold fasting and prayer. They will be too serious. Seriously, they will be too serious. Those of you who don't want to come to church, you will even resign your job. You will come here and pray day and night and you will even look for death. You will not get it because you have to face the wrath, the tribulation period. The system would have taken over the world. But the bride of Christ will be with the Lord. She will be preparing to come back into the world. This same earth, the Bible says we shall inherit it. We are going to come back here and we shall be lords over the people of the earth. So It depends on what your vision is. If you believe this message, believe it without with all your heart, without doubting. You may have problems in your own personal life. Don't you worry about that. The word will take care of that. Keep coming and sitting under. He will wash you clean. He will perfect you. The reason why we have the word and the Holy Ghost is to perfect us. He knows that we are not perfect. But he is perfect. You don't worry about your weaknesses and worry about doubting this message. Never doubt the message. Never question the message because it is God's provided way that will always stay the cast. Okay, follow me closely here now. So Elijah ministry is promised to come before the Lord comes. It is very important because the world is under a curse and they needed to be restored back to the savior so that they they can stay the cast and I want you to see first of all who is the savior who these are basic things. Sometimes we preach this and this until you don't know what you believe. So who is our savior? Let's begin with that. Who redeemed us? The prophet does not redeem us. Elijah does not redeem. Elijah does not save us. Elijah does not give us grace in our hearts to receive the word. He doesn't fill us with the Holy Ghost. Elijah is a man like me, like you, but God uses him in a special way. A special way. And who is our savior? Christ Jesus is our redeemer. And I've never seen any religious movement that lifts up Christ more than this message. In this message, we lift up Christ. They lift money. We lift Christ. They lift riches. We lift the rapture. They lift cars and prosperity. But we lift righteousness and holiness. It is in this message that Christ Jesus is preached more than any religious movement. So some of you have been thinking We are just followers of William Bron. You need to go back to school. You need to learn what this is all about. This is much more than William. This is about unveiling of Jesus Christ. It's about understanding the word. Actually, when you come to the message, you were a Bible reader before. And when you come to the message, you open the Bible, it will be a new book to you. Brother, listen. You understand it in a much better way than you used to understand it. The message lifts Christ out of history and brings Colossians 3:13. Christ has redeemed us from the curse. who is our redeemer. Come on now, you can preach with me. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Who is our redeemer? Being made a curse for us. For it is written, cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ that we also might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. You remember the blessing of Abraham. I'll bless them that bless you. I'll cast them that cursed. You remember that? You know, Abraham was blessed by God. No one could curse. And the Bible here says the blessing of Abraham comes through Christ. The blessing of Abraham, it comes on what? On the Gentiles. Now, oh my God. I was inspired on this thing. I believe it will help some people. Listen. Malachi was a prophet to the Jews. All the promises and blessings he was mentioning did not have anything to do with us the Gentiles. It was for the Jews. Even Christ came to the Jews. Everything was for the Jews. Why? They are children of the promise. We were not. We were like dogs. But I want you to see something. We as Gentiles, we are somehow connected in that blessing by faith through Christ Jesus. So then the promises that were for the Jews automatically become our promises. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Elijah the Dishbite came to the Jews. Amen. Elisha came to the Jews. Nothing to do with the Gentiles. Where we are the Gentiles. They were on earth. But they were the outcast. But now when Malachi 4, he gives a prophecy right at the end of the Old Testament. Amen. Trying to show you something. And there is another testament coming. And that testament will not be sealed by blood of bulls and goats. It will be sealed by the blood of one that died. He would become a curse for the entire not the Jews only now but for the entire human race. Jesus became a curse for the entire human race. And now the Bible would say there is no male or female. There is no Jew or Gentile. Why? He's seeing everybody now through the blood. And that's why the prophecy of Malachi 4 was not fulfilled in the Old Testament. It was supposed to be fulfilled. In the New Testament, it was supposed to be fulfilled. Amen. When the new covenant was coming, listen church, the new covenant which was coming was not for the Jews only. It was for the Gentiles also. So if he says, "Behold, I will send you who? The ones that are going to receive the Messiah. [Applause] Who is going to receive the Messiah? Who is going to receive the Messiah? The Jews and the Gentiles. Did the Jews receive the Messiah? The Bible says he came among his own. But his own received him. No. But to as many as have received him. to them to them gave he power to become the sons of God. So beloved, the Bible says now are we the sons of God. We took the place of the Jews. That is why we can receive a prophecy which was meant for them and we receive it as if it is ours. We parttook of the blessing. I'm telling you these things are sweet. Follow me closely now. He says Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us. For it was written cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree. that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles, on the Gentiles, through Jesus Christ that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith. Are you learning? Romans 8:1. Amen. Now the curse was the curse of sin. Okay. Okay. Now, now follow me closer. When the law was given and uh it was supposed to be obeyed, everyone that disobeyed the law was under the curse. So now we were all born disobedient. under the curse. The curse of sin. Sin is unbelief. Sin is refusing to believe the word of God. And the way the law was, it made people disobey. You know, even today you can see it. If they say no passing, you will find people trying to say, "How can I pass without being seen? That's what the law did. The law made us sinners. The law made us naked. The law condemned us. But you see, when Jesus came to change things, he came that we might have have freedom. He came that we might be free. He came that condemnation can be removed. He came that we might be stayed from the curse. There's only one one curse and that's the curse of sin. And anyone who has not received Christ in their life is under that curse. Anyone who has not believed him is under that curse. You remember Jesus spoke to the Pharisees and he told them you are but whosoever that does not believe in me is condemned already. So meaning condemnation of the curse is upon every nonbeliever. That's why it is important for you not to marry an unbeliever. Even you're marrying or getting married to somebody who is under a [Music] curse. All the curses and demons and spells of his family lineage are still on. You want to marry or get married to third, you need to know that people who believe the word, they were taken out of those things, they were put under the blessing of the word, you are put under the blessing which maketh rich. Now if you go back and mingle with such, you don't know what you're talking about. The Bible here then says through Jesus Christ the blessing of Abraham came upon the Gentiles. And so now here in Romans 8. Now remember Romans were Gentiles. So Paul writes to them and he says these words, "There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ." He did not say there is therefore now no condemnation to the Jews, not to the Gentiles. But he said to them which are in Christ Jesus. Amen. To them who walk not after the flesh. But to them that walk after the spirit. And then he continues and says, for the law listen is another law. For the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus. There's that law. Law of spirit of life. Spirit of life. That spirit of life. which is in Christ Jesus. So when you receive the Holy Ghost after believing the word, you have received the spirit, the quickening spirit, the quickening power. So it's a law working in you. Amen. So the spirit, the law of spirit of life has made me free from the law of sin and death. That's why we can't die. That's why we can perish. That's why we can't go to hell. Because there is another law working in our soul. The law of spirit of life in Christ Jesus. That one has set us free from the law of sin. Which means we cannot sin even. The Bible says they that are born of God cannot sin because the sin remains. I want you to understand a believer. A true born again child of God cannot sin and cannot die. It's the word of God. I cannot sin. I cannot die. You cannot sin. You cannot die. Believe it. Believe it. Is it easier to believe it? No. That's why to be a believer is special. Amen. That's why we are believers. Father, we are special. We are a royal priesthood. We are a royal priesthood. Hallelujah. We are peculiar people. We are special in this world. We are not to be mistaken by for others. We have the law operating in us. The law of spirit of life and has made us free from the law of sin. Amen. Now, that's why Jesus came. That's why he died. That's why he gave his life's blood. That's why he came and died on the cross. So that we can receive this law in us. You know, is fighting because there is another law working in it. is the law of sin. But you see your body is an unbeliever. But you see there is another one in you. Your soul has the law of spirit of life. You know no matter how the body functions and works, the body will end up in the grave, but your soul will end up in the rapture. Always remind your flesh. always remind it I am not a citizen of this world. I am not a citizen of this country. Amen. That's why a believer does not die. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Now listen friend. In every age, you know Christ died once. The Bible says once for sin he entered into the holy of holies not more than once. So there's no other death to save or to redeem. Christ has already redeemed. But in every generation, in every dispensation, God has to hand out the people. Uh what I would call the imputation of grace, of righteousness. He hands it out. in every dispensation. He died for the living at the time and those that would come in the future he died for both Jew and Gentile. But you see in every age the people of that generation they have to receive that blood. and accept it. Don't worry, you'll understand what I'm saying. Actually 2:39 says, "The promise is unto you, the Jews, to your children, the Jews, to all those that are far off, the Gentiles, and even as many as our Lord shall call, the Jews and the Gentiles. So the promise, hallelujah, of the spirit, the Bible says we shall receive through faith. It is not automatic. In every generation, the receivers of that promise, they will receive it through faith. Faith in what? Faith in the finished work. How shall they know? He says, "How shall they know without a preacher?" So he will send a preacher. But there are many preachers and everyone is saying something different. That's why God is a God of order. In Romans 3:7 he says he will do nothing but he will send his servant the prophet in every generation. He will send one prophet and that prophet will be the measurement will be the basis of what the believers of that age. failure to subscribe to that. You are under a curse. The same curse that Jesus took away, you are under it because you have refused to believe in Jesus Christ. You saying the message of of these prophets is Jesus Christ. Yes. Is speaking through them. Amen. Now, this promise for both Jews and Gentiles in the Ephesian church age and brother be ready with that first uh picture on the church ages. It says John the messenger at the time walking in the midst of those seven golden candles. It was Jesus Christ working in the midst of the c the almighty God. What is he doing? He didn't say he was working in one candlestick. Let me have a picture, brother. He was walking in the midst of all of them. We are now in the book of Revelation. That's what I'm reading about. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He was walking in the midst of all the What does that denote? That he is the same God yesterday, today and forever. And in every church age to every believer, he comes with the Holy Ghost, to every age and to every person it is same yesterday, and forever. as you see there's church agents. Brother, can you give me this picture when you've zoomed it out and make sure everything can be seen. Praise the name of the Lord. The rapture consists of saints from every age, believers in every generation. The messenger of each age had the message of that age that stayed the [Music] cast. So when we say brother where are the stars when we say that um you know we have an end time message which has stayed the cast. We are not talking about our time only. We are talking about even the times before us. God has been moving. Not in our generation only. This I'm talking about a dispensational gospel. The message of Christ is a dispensational gospel. This you must understand. We are not the only saints. There are others before us. So when we talk about the message, it's not only the message of our time. We're talking about the message even before. Remember it is the blood that has reconciled us to God. But every one claims to have the word. You see, but the Bible puts this distinction and this is what I want us to get into. Where is the blood today? Where is the word today? If you see these church ages, right from the first one, you know, these are candlesticks. In the book of Revelation, it says there was one like a son of man. walking in the midst of the candlestick. The candlestick means a church. Jesus has one church but that church is spread out in many generations from the days of the apostles up to today. The first church age was called Ephesus. And in every church age, God sends a what? A prophet, a messenger. Then comes Paul. Paul the apostle was the first messenger. Brother said, "How did I come up come up with all these messengers?" He says he used to preach. The first principle here he said was the the the messengers had to be patterned according to the first messenger. So there he looked number one thing he looked at was the pattern. So you see Paul was a man of God and in that pattern. He said Paul was true to the word. He never deviated from it. He always was believing the word. He always took the stand of the word not the seminary or organization. And then he say another way in that button he said Paul was a man of the spirit. He never preached in word only but power signs and wonders the supernatural was following his grace. And then he said another way that Paul had the evident fruit of his ministry. So that was the first way that brother was able to pattern all these other messengers and he said the other way was by divine inspiration. So now we see that he was able to tell each church age and their [Music] message. Paul was the one of the first one 53 AD to 170 AD. And that was the first church age up to 170 to 80. And then comes Iranas. Iranas from to the age of 17 to 312. Read the church age book to get the details. Not everything can be talked about on the pool. Just get into the book and read. If you don't have it, please read it. I'll shall give it to you. It's good to know the history of the church. Amen. Some of you have read European history. This is church history. Now, the age of 312 to 606. Martin was the messenger. 606 to 1520 and God used a man called 1520 to 1750. Come sadis and God used a man called Luther. I've talked about him many times. Then come 1752 1906 in the age of God flood of fear. the missionary age. And then God uses a man called John Whizzley. And each of these men had a thus saith the Lord for their age. And their message stayed the curse in that generation where they come. Where are we right now? 2025. How many years? More than 50 years since God sent William Brown to this age. There are others God used in the beginning. There was a man called William Sime. at the beginning of this age. God used him atus and other people in the Pentecostal revival. But you see their revival was only one-sided. They did not have the uh mechanics but they had a dynamics. Listen, they had a supernatural signs, wonders, miracles, and all these things, but they never had the restoration of the world. That's why they were not the messenger. But we see the messenger of the very last age will have both the restoration of the word and the power. [Music] two-sided and we see that ministry was through William and that was the last one. So what comes next now? Hey, what is coming next? The rapture of the church. Amen. I am thinking of the rapture in a blessed home on earth when the redeemed are gathering. That's what we are waiting for. We are waiting to gather in actually we already gathering in with this message of your life. Hallelujah. The messenger of each age. He had the message that stayed the curse. Remember, it is the blood that reconciles us back to God. But everyone today in the world, they claim to have the word. But you see the Bible says the word has reconciled us. The blood has reconciled us. The word has reconciled us. Meaning the blood became the word. The Bible is going to give us a distinction here. Now don't miss this thing here. Now listen, follow closely. We have something that we can be able to differentiate and say these ones have missed it. have it because everyone has this. The Bible, the Catholics have it. The Orthodox have it. The angry can have the But why have they missed it? They're missing something. They have missed the messenger's message. Let me show you. Let me show you. 2 Corinthians 5 18. And all things are of God, who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and he has given to us the ministry of reconciliation. Listen to we that God was in Christ. reconciling the world to himself. Not Are you following me? That's 10% of you. Are you following me? Not imputing their trespasses unto them. And he has committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Okay. Everyone believes the blood of Jesus. They even sing about it. This Sunday morning Catholic church they sing the you know we sing a song that is sung across ordinary the blood of Jesus and they claim to believe the blood. But let us put it to a test. Do they really believe the blood? Do they accept the blood? Where is the blood? Do you have some little bottles of the blood of Jesus? Can we pass it around and sell it? Come on now. There is no bottles of the blood. If it was, we would just be drinking and selling it around. If they had it, they would be selling it. But many of them sell oil. They sell holy water. But they don't have blood because blood you can sell. Blood. The Bible says freely you have received freely came. He is the one who paid the price and blood is somewhere. I said blood of Jesus is somewhere. There is a place where it is. In that place is received for free. For free. No payment. That the currency, the currency with which you buy it is called faith. Faith. Faith. But where is the blood today? The blood is the word. Hallelujah. Amen. The blood is the word. The word that reconciles us to God in the blood of Jesus. And that blood, that word comes by every messenger in one age. God sent a messenger. Where's the picture, brother? Amen. We are talking about the gentile church. Brother Marvin, do I still have that picture? Oh, in the first eight, God, Amen, gave Paul the blood. He said, Paul, here is the blood. Go and apply it. And then Paul came. He was a bold man. And he spoke words. And he said, the words I speak to you, the words I speak to you are not words. Man is wisdom teaches. Amen. And then he said, "Be it unto you known that they are the commandments of God." He said, "If we or another messenger or an angel from here, come and preach another. If he comes and preach another gospel other than the one I preached, me and the apostles and someone comes and Let him be cast. You see now why? Because Paul's message stayed the C. If you believe Paul's message, you are not under the curse. But if you refused it, you were under a c. And what was Paul's message? Paul preached. Women must not be pastors. It means every church, every preacher that believes in women pastor is under the curse. And Paul preached, "You must be baptized in much water in the name of the Lord, which means everybody who doesn't suddenly under." Paul said, "Women dress in mother's come here help me preach this morning." Hallelujah. Amen. He said, "Dress in modesty. This is modesty." Hallelujah. Amen. But you see, what happens? Come here. You find girls dressing like this. That's not modesty. There's a problem that's not modest. Why? They are under a curse. The curse of sin, the cast of blindness, the unbelief. But those who believe in the message of the messenger, they were stayed away. The curse was stay there was no more condemnation. Amen. And Paul set the pattern. His message was the blood. No doubt about that. His message was the blood. Even he himself could not change it. No man can change it. No apostle can change it. It was given by God. Amen. In every age. God has committed to them the word meaning the message that stayed the curse of God. Hebrews 9:12, neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, he entered in once into the Holy P obtained eternal redemption for us who Christ Jesus. Amen. Amen. I said amen. What is the message? The message is the bleeding word. Did you understand it? If you understood it, shout amen. The message is the bleeding word. Okay, let me quote it now. In the message, the invisible union of the bride of Christ. Glory. That's why we caught. We are caught in the bleeding. Hallelujah. What is sin? Sin is unbelief. Unbelief in what? In the world? Unbelief in God, which is the word, the pure unadulterated. Your garments washed by the water of the blessing. The word became black. The word bled for you. You are washed in the bleeding word. Amen. Do I have believers here? Do we have them here today? Hallelujah. Amen. They preach visa and they shout. They preach miracle and they shout this is much greater than all of Hallelujah. Glory. The word became the blood. You are washed. Not me only. You me. We are in a bleeding word. The word bleeding. the life of God in the word. The word was bled for you that you might be washed from the filth of these prostitutes of these prostitutes and be cleaned and be sanctified by the washing of the water of the word. Hallelujah. And make your mind and your heart stayed on God. and on his word. And on his what? Amen. End time evangelism. He says each age has its message and it messengers all through the times. Every age has sparked his message with a messenger. God in every dispensation has sent forth someone has sent forth someone anointed with the Holy Spirit to bring forth his message for that. God has anointed someone. God has anointed someone. I can tell you he has anointed me, but I'm not that man. There is one man in the age that God has anointed. And his name is Brother. Hallelujah. His name is William. William. What is his name? Brother. Hallelujah. Amen. So you know his name. What about you brother? Oh, I was waiting for someone who was going to say something else. Let me ask this young sister. She always preaches at at school. What's the name of that one messenger? Maybe everybody's giving wrong answer. Please help them. Oh my god. Oh my god. Hallelujah. Even in the mouth of babies, God has already declared it. But if someone doesn't believe it, I want to tell them you are too late. Hallelujah. Amen. What is the proof? I am the proof that I have been restored. I received a message. I've been restored back again. To the beginning before I fall. This message has stayed the cast. I cannot be cast anymore. I have been redeemed by the blood of Jesus. That is why we believe the message. It is not a man. It is more than a man. Hallelujah. Amen. These messengers. This man of God that he has anointed in every area. Don't doubt it. And if someone comes close to you doubting it, brother, sister, let them stay with their curses. Let them stay with their cars. Yes, sir. You know, let me tell you something. One time Abraham have always quoted this. He went with his servants and his servants stayed down there and he was going up on the mountain to worship. You know let me tell you he has said in the Bible he has given us the blessing of Abra but Abraham worshiped Abraham gave the sacrifice of worship. True worship is belief of the truth. But you see, you know, as he went up on the mountain, the other ones who were carrying the donkeys, the servants, there are some people who have been around us for some time in the message 10 years, 5 years 20, 30, 40, but they were never really going to make the sacrifice. Some were just servants carrying the donkeys. But you know what? When they reach on the bank of the mountain, Abraham turned to his boy, he said, "Boy, take this firewood. Let's go up on the mountain. And as for you servants, stay with the donkeys. Stay with the donkeys. My son and I are going up the mountain to worship. It is time, brethren. It is time, friends. Those of you listening to me today, for some of you, you turn to some of the people, you call your friends, you call your leaders, you call your whatever, I don't care who you call, if they don't believe this message, tell them stay with the donkeys. Did someone hear that? Stay with the donkeys. Come on, say it right now. Stay with the donkeys. They ought to stay with their donkeys, their donkeys of sin, the donkeys of unbelief, the donkeys of religion. As for me and my house, we are going up the mountain. We are going to offer the sacrifice. Hallelujah. Amen. We have arrived where we are to to worship the Lord in spirit and in truth. The bleeding word is here. But as for them, they can stay with their donkeys. Hallelujah. Whenever you come close to an unbeliever, to a doubter, tell them with a donkey. But as for me, I'm going to worship. Hallelujah. Was it really a messenger? Yes, sir. I doubt it. Stay with your daughter. No, no, no. Let me tell you, William died. He was knocked. He was knocked. No, brother. Why are you changing? He died badly. Is the truth. Who will not die badly? Even John the Baptist himself, the Elijah before him, they cut off his head. I can tell you he died badly. But that does not mean he was not a messenger. As a matter of fact, when Jesus comes, the man decreases and Jesus increases. Why William died? Jesus has engraved. This is a Jesus based church. We are Jesus believers. But as for the others who don't who don't believe it, tell them to tell them to stay with their donkeys. But for us, we believe it. Do I have those who believe it here in the church? Hallelujah. Amen. Brother, please, please, please work on my interpreter. I want us to walk with him. All right? Cuz I'm still having one one or two more doses here before we finish in in the message. The fifth seal, notice the first Elijah that were that was him. That was him. The second Elijah was Elisha. The third was John. Now when brother reaches Abraham the fourth he doesn't say was me. So he says the fourth was the seventh angel or the last messenger. So he introduces a new term here. Now, seventh angel. So we want to know who's the first, second, third, fourth. You see, according to Malachi 4 and Revelation 107. Now the fifth time, he is a messenger to the Jews, to the 144,000 after the church is gone. Many people say yes there was Elijah there was Elishah John then no one else up to the one who is coming to the Jews but anyone who would say that is uneducated is doesn't understand the Bible because then where is the Gentiles where are they in the world God is a God of a good economy He blesses everybody properly, even Gentiles. We have partaken of the Jewish blessing. And we too have received an Elijah. Amen. Amen. If Jesus did not come, then the Jews, the Gentiles would not have received an Elijah because we had nothing to be restored to. But because amen Jesus came and he died and he redeemed us and he brought us the word then now over the ages the word has been diluted the word has been forfired the word has been redeemed removed. So then God had to send an Elijah ministry to the Gentiles to restore the word back. Are you following me? Now in I'm reading the Ludian church 8. This messenger of Malachi 4 and Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. Are you ready for them? Amen. Especially you who don't come on Wednesday. Let your amen be louder now. One, according to Malachi 4, he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. two, he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven se. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Number one, he will turn what the hearts of the children. Where are the children? Hello children. Hello children. We are the children of God. Our hearts are going to be turned back. You know those people. The spirit of the age has made us instead of being a church without you find our churches they dancing you know that kind of thing with their small dresses pants and they say let's give a dance to Jesus and then they begin throwing their legs You know, other people like, "Oh yeah." Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What is it? The church is dead. The world is in the church. They are no longer entertained by the word. They are entertained by the world. But there must be a prophet. a message that will restore the church, back to the original, back to true worship, back to the Bible, Amen, that ministry must be here. Anyone that doesn't believe it, they happy with what the devil is doing. They are happy with infant baptism. Name this child name reject the world and all things therein. Godfather Women are [Music] that is deception of the highest woman. A big man asking for a child. The child is believing by proxy. Some of you are in those denominations. Some of you don't know what you're talking about. But some of you are there. You were deceived. But God called you up. The message we have believed has called us and we are restored back to the original, back to the apostolic faith, back to the Bible. We are the true original Bible [Applause] believers. And we believe the Bible is the absolute because the message we believe has not brought a new idea. It has restored us back to what was before. Tell me, is there any doctrine Is there a teaching that the message taught that is not here? The message is not new. It is the original. We are restored back again. There is no new ideas. Don't ever think that, brother. Some of you get confused. You think this message is a new idea, a new revelation. No, it is the old. If you're not, sing with me. Give me that old time red. Oh, give me that time. Now give me that. Oh, it's good. All right. Wait. You sung well only that you sang like Catholics. Let us sing it again. Like Pentecostal. Give me that all time religion. Give me that all time. Will you give me that old time religion is good enough for me. Listen, it was good for our fathers. It was good for our fathers. Well, it was good for our fathers. Is good for me. Okay. It was good for brother Brham. It was good for brother. He was the messenger of our age. Good for brother is good enough for me. What is the old time religion? The old time religion is Jesus Christ is the Bible is the word is righteousness holiness of the Holy Ghost. God is the old time religion and that's what we have been restored to. Amen. He will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelation 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven [Music] seals. Amen. So we are the people that have received the true revelation of the seven thunder. So can I now say we are the true seven thunder people. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. We are the truth seven thunder people. Why? Because the Malachi 4 prophet, Revelation 10 prophet when he comes, he will reveal the mysteries in those seven thunder of Revelation 10. Because you know when the thunder when the thunder thundered And then John was about to write the mysteries contained in there. But the voice told him John shut it up. John don't write anything. But this is verse seven. act in the days of the voice of the servant joy. When he begins to sound, the mystery, the mysteries of the thunders shall be finished. When are those days coming? We are living in those days. Hallelujah. Amen. The seventh angel messenger has come. Amen. Amen. Elijah has come. Tell your neighbor, Elijah's come. Elijah has come. And when Elijah comes, everything is finished. Everything is restored. The church is waiting but for the rapture. And now the seven thunder movement is on. We are the seven thunder revival. What are the seven thunders? They are the revelations contained in the seven seals. Amen. What are those revelations? You are looking at one. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I am the revelation contained in there. I am you are it is the revelation of the bride. Hallelujah. Don't complicate it. You are the revelation of the book. When the book is open, when the seal is loosed, behold the bride. Hallelujah. The bride is revealed. We now know who we are. We are the bride. We are not just the church. We are the bride of Christ waiting for the rapture. And I'm waiting for that chariot to swing low. And I'll step on my way. I will ride to heaven. of guru. [Applause] Go maring. I can see you be one of them. Sing it. When the saint Oh, go maring. Well, when I say go maring, I'll be there to be a number. When the saints When the saints go [Music] Amen. Amen. We have been revealed, the original life. Oh my. Hallelujah. You know that song, the original life, the original seed, the original one is what I believe. The seventh seal is revealed. Uhhuh. The original life. The original se. Listen now to this part. We are the word made flesh today. We are the word made flesh. We are the seven thunder. Hallelujah. Amen. We will be so changed alive and so changed filled with the Holy Ghost living for God that you will make the devil have a headache. You will become a thunder to the devil. He won't know what to do with you. What are you? You are the seventh son [Applause] revealed. Amen. We are the word made flesh of Jesus. This is what the scriptures and our names are seen within redeemed and perfect. Yes, we are anointed. Hallelujah. Amen. And we are by our God who is the original. The original life. Hallelujah.

Some have made the seven thunder as some kind of cout movement. I am not a cult. I'm not a movement. I am a person. I'm revealed. I'm unveiled. And then the other part of me that is waiting is him to come. And then he too says when he comes I shall be like him because we are two parts of the same person. Christ is the head. We are the body. If we want we can complicate the message. If we want we can make it simple as the word is. Amen. Amen. Oh my. Now let me try to land this plan tonight. We are told in Revelation 10 that there will be a messenger in the last day and he will gather up these loose ends and will bring them together and then the mystery of God would be finished at the sounding of this angel. which was the messenger of the ark. What will he do? He will gather up these little ends. So there are many preachers who have come and there have been men of God over the ages. But you see when this prophet of Revelation 10:7 comes who is also the prophet of Malachi 4, he's going to tie the loose ends together. Some people think brother Bana made up what he taught. The word of God is not for private revelation. Let me tell you, if God revealed something to me, he will reveal it to you. He doesn't have private revelation. It's God revealing. Sometimes I've seen myself preach someone's here and then I see another preacher preach the same. Did you copy what I did? No. The word of God is public domain. So you find many things preached. They were all before. all preach but people who preach them did not preach it in the full revelation there. So what was the work of the prophet of revelation? It was to tie the loose ends. Say yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. No. They're wrong here. It is like this. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's what he did. He didn't bring anything new. He came to to climax the revelation. God used him that way. That divinely revealed truth can take us back again to the foundations of our family. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise God. Can I continue from there on Wednesday? God bless your church. God bless your hearts. Amen. I love this message. I love this message. Amen. Where are your smiles? Do you love this message? Praise God. The message has stayed the course. The enemy wanted to destroy us. But thank God, the message has stayed the course. more. Can the musicians come please? I want us to sing a song. Say that thank God I'm free.

The song will lead us in a song as we dismiss be here again on Wednesday that will be Apo. So um if all goes well I'm planning to travel around this Easter. Um, but if I but we we we as a church we know we have we have been invited to the convention, the Easter [Music] convention. So please let us try our best to get there. There are two things we need to do. We need to save ourel that camp fee. If you're not going to stay there, please it's a small amount 35,000. Let's try to save that as individuals and then as a church we have been trying to uh do pledges. I've not got an update on how much but I would like to request all those who pledged to please fulfill your pledges so that we can support our sister church. Uh I know it takes having organized u uh international gatherings for the past three years. I know it's not easy. So let's support when we can take 200,000 there. It would be good for you to do that. But that's too little. Bring it. Let us join it together and then you will take only the comfort and let us gather something today which we can give. Is that amen? And the meetings is beginning this 17th. Uh that means next week next week that's when the the conversion is started. As usual we usually have our Sunday service we participate in all the other days but we maintain the Sunday service. We only have one service in the morning. Those who want to be in the conversion on Sunday, it's still Yeah. But we will have to maintain our Sunday service. Is that understood? All the other services and participate and it's a good thing the meetings are beginning on Thursday after our Wednesday. We will not have any of our services interrupted. So please try and participate as much. I think I've announced that in a very good [Music] way for the past three weeks. We have been announcing this and we don't want to ashame our fellowship you find you are going there you have no comfort. You remember in our confession we told them don't come without comfort. We should be examples. Don't go without comfort. Don't say I don't have so I want to go. That's a bad attitude. You've had enough time. We've been announcing for some time. So, you've had some time to look for that. It's not so big. try your best those meetings I've noticed when we have a convention and our people participate in this it helps them spiritually it is a very good thing you should always participate it's a shame if you stay at home in a holiday like that because it's a Easter holiday it's a shame for you to stay at or go visit your family of your relatives who are not even unbelievable unless if it's your mom or your father or your sister but the distant relative it would be a shame. Let's try our best brethren. be in such meeting. So we are not announcing it lightly. We want you to go because it those meetings are a blessing. Is it a man? Amen. Parents look for funds to support your children. She will save you from a lot of trouble. Young sisters, young brothers, go and take your unbelieving friends because there there will not be anyone to watch you and say, "Ah, you have this one as your friend." No one knows you there. Check all your friends there. Who knows what the Lord will do such a meeting. Well, the Lord bless you. We're going to have a minister's meeting now. and then afterwards we shall go to minister in say God bless you. I'll not mention names of course been there have been those that have consistently supported you know a few well for us to always drive there's a sister last Sunday who gave me 100,000 shillings for the fuel. God bless you so much. It comes without saying. It comes without saying but ministry needs [Music] money. Those of you religiously supporting your church and the work of God, Yeah. Really may God bless you. I pray you may not get physical blessings here. You will, but you may not. But I assure you, you have a reward. God bless you. Nice to see you. But nice to see you. God bless you. God bless you all. We love you on Wednesday, brother. Let let him lead us in our dismissing [Music] song. [Music] Lean secure from all along.
