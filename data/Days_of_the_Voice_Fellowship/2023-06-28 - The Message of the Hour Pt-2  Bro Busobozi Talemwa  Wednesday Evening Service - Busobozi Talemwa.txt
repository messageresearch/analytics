I've had another story The Savior came from Glory how we met like me [Music] and won the victory amen Victory Jesus my Savior foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] and somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory amen Victory in Jesus my Savior forever [Music] oh he blocked me to Victory [Music] he has beautiful me in glory and I heard about that stress of gold beyond the crystals [Music] we are Victory in Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] father Lord we thank you so much for the victory in Jesus foreign [Music] I mean amen [Applause] I would like to greet you once again in the name of Jesus Christ that the Lord is giving you Grace to move on in this journey there's the devil will throw whatever he wants to throw in the middle of the road Gala but did you realize that the Bible says to them that overcome and it says that in every generation so which means in every generation it is and there were many excuses of those who did not overcome [Music] we would have overcome but because of this in our generation it was very difficult in this area but you see in every age despite those things that discourage there shall be those who shall overcome it what about and so whenever a morning comes and you are finding yourself in your Christian Journey still walking in this journey you are unovercome [Music] and so God bless you overcome us amen and may we continue to overcome every day uh and we shall render the power of certain powers we are reading out of second Peter chapter 2 chapter one and we shall read verses um second Peter 1 12. [Music] um I'd like you to remember brother shame in prayers [Music] the people there they actually they had I forgot to tell you on Sunday but they had their first uh service last last Saturday and they told me that it was attended by 16 students and he told me what he preached to them it was a very good subject and so in that meeting they agreed to me twice uh actually some one of them was suggesting every evening but they agree that they would be meeting twice a week and by God is Grace I'm planning to be taking the second day it is I don't know what they agreed on maybe uh Friday and Saturday or Wednesday and Saturday Thursday and Saturday [Music] so I'll be going there every Saturday and we'll share the message with those students I think that is a very good way for this message to go into the aviation industry really I believe that each of us whichever area we are in one hour can penetrate that area with this message if indeed you are truly burdened for this truth you want everyone to hear the message you want everyone to go to heaven so I mean you might be a student somewhere you might be going to work somewhere whatever you are doing please remember the Lord amen so we are reading verses 12. I hope everybody's there now is wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth in Japan [Music] amen amen may be seated so my subject to you this evening it's part two of what I shared with you last Wednesday how many remember what I shared on on Wednesdays [Music] what was that the message of the hour and so I usually speak for one hour on Wednesday and I'm asking for your undivided attention as we try to see what the Lord has for us tonight so Peter here writes and talks about what he calls the present truth it is impossible for there to be more than one truth in a generation there has never been more than one truth there has always been one truth and when Jesus came on Earth he said I am the way I am the truth [Music] he did not say I am a truth but he said I am the truth meaning outside of me you cannot find truth there is no truth anywhere else actually Jesus said that all the others that came before me yes they were thieves and robots I am lowly and meek and then he said I am the truth not only the truth he also said I am the way there is only one truth and that truth will be the same in every generation it can never change it can never change its form there is [Applause] time will change seasons will change the truth will always remain the same people even change the people that are on Earth today exactly in one thousand years if the lottery you will not have any of them on this Earth and that has happened several times since the days of Jesus Christ because you've had Generations Disappear Completely to write the name is other Generations but the truth has remained the same and no man can change the truth man will deceive man and they will appear to follow things or Traditions which appear like truth but regardless of what the devil tries to do the truth cannot be changed the truth cannot be exchanged the truth cannot be debated the truth Remains the truth and nothing but the truth and so God in his wisdom he gave his word the Bible says he gave you his word and he said great was the company of those that published it there are very many you find there were many preachers for example the book of Acts of the Apostles foreign [Music] the word of God cannot be changed or exchanged there have been many other people that have come with ideas they have been like Buddha for example Buddha like Muhammad for example and John Smith your kind of Smith the one who came with the with the idea that he met angels and they gave him a book which he called the the the third Testament and he says the Bible is true like a Bible in truth but God gave him a sad Testament in addition to the Bible and there is a big denomination that follows that a Doctrine and they believe they have the third Testament because things that are not in the Bible but it is in addition to the Bible you find one he said that what he heard he was given to him by administration of angels Mountain there in the Middle East and it's spoken that the Quran is Holy because the Quran has holy scriptures which came by the administration of angels and you have many other books there is a this other book I forgotten its name there's several other books that are considered to be holy books and many people believe in them in the world but all those books came after the Bible there is no books there is no inspiration that will be more than the Bible that will be true we've got that [Music] which we have received are you following me I'm a preacher so I'm preaching this to you but really I'm teaching sometimes I think I said to myself let me just go and be a quiet teacher and I teach this thing really well and I fail because I'm meant difference now I want you to look at Galatians chapter one praise the name of the Lord I want to bring perspective to you regarding this message [Music] verses six I mother that ye are soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ and to another gospel which is not another but there be some that trouble you and would pervert the gospel of Christ so in other words when Paul writes to the Galatians he's telling them something very important he's saying that I'm so surprised when you came to the knowledge of the grace of Christ through the gospel but that you've been called into another gospel to be removed from this goes and he went to another gospel all these others have been telling you are also gospels all these other books are gospels but then he says it is not another gospel but there are some that trouble you and pervert the gospel of Christ this other so-called gospels all these new traditions and ideas it is not another gospel the Quran is not another gospel Quran John Smith is Mormon teaching is not another gospel John Smith says there are many there are many more now where do you mean it's not entirely something new every trivia but what is it it is a perversion of the true gospel there have been those that have made big denominations and there have been those that have come and preached privately and they say God sent to them but when we see what they are preaching it is it is not founded in the scriptures that is how we are able to know that is the perversion of the truth and it is not the original foreign [Music] foreign [Applause] remember I'm talking about the message we have had a confusion people have thought something new with Watchers cannot be something new it cannot be something different from what was given in the beginning it cannot be a new revelation more than what is in the Bible if it is but I want to tell you this is God sends the prophet God says he doesn't come with a new message he comes with the message listen to what I said the message way you what is the message of the hour is the present truth what is the present truth there is only one truth that is Jesus Christ that is God himself he's the only truth I am the way I am the truth I am the life in every generation when a man comes on the scene do you know what he comes with you he comes with Jesus Christ Alone he points to Jesus not to an organization not to himself he points you to Jesus and that's how I'm able to know foreign Jesus Christ yes Christo is the same Yom help me finish it yesterday Joe and today and forever what is he trying to say the truth is the same yesterday John today and forever the truth can never change the truth will always be the same that's why when William Burnham came he said I preached what Paul preached the message is not a new truth but what our religions have done they have perverted that truth foreign but today you know the theologians they look into that Truth uh this one is no longer working let us change the place where it says talking is talking about the deacons wives for them they said let us write let us not read another Bible let us not do another Bible people will realize let us do another version like a Bible yes and then in our version Let Us remove a few scriptures to suit our teachings you know even the homosexuals have made a new Bible did you know the Bible which supports them that's the same way the women preachers just the same with those who don't believe in the Holy Ghost their own Bible versions foreign foreign [Music] foreign but you can even use father son Holy Spirit instead of Jesus Christ and now why does God need to send a prophets this message is not a new idea that's why I keep telling you it's not a new church and we who received it we are still contending for it now hallelujah amen the Bible says content for that Faith which was first given to the Saints we are contending for it by believing [Music] to restore us never not be hallelujah hallelujah so it's not a new idea they are the ones with a new idea it's not a new idea and I ask you a question now can there be more than one truth [Music] what we believe we cannot say it's always going to go on the rapture are going to be a part of our child cannot be denominated the message for example was like the uh Seventh-Day Adventists what does it mean it means for you to go to heaven you must join that nomination and you're a member of that denomination when Jesus comes you Rapture the members of that denomination he said my truth will remain I am going to send someone who is completely out of all their systems someone they can't understand someone is that is not loyal to them someone that is only loyal to me and I'm going to be bring my present truth to him and I will tell him to go to all of them and give them the presence my children who among them when they hear this present truth what will they here come out of her my people come out of denomination come out of the region come out of the systems come into the truth into Jesus Christ and this message has called us out this message has been sent to all the nominations and who are those going in the Rapture it doesn't matter whether they will hear this truth and they will believe it some of them may be in the mosque right now [Music] what do you tell them foreign you may be on the road but if you're fully convinced if you're fully convinced you are going to be concerned you're going to tell them you're going to tell them you're going to push them over Syndicate you're going to squeeze them over and you get you're going to do everything you can or connect your natural to bring in everybody you can but I'm presenting them to Jesus Christ are you not so happy to know that you are not members of this church but you are members of the body of Jesus Christ remember and how do you become a member of the body I believe in Jesus as your personal Savior by being baptized in much water I don't know that is and then he fills you with the Holy Ghost that one makes you a member of the body of Jesus Christ he will burn out those fleshly desires he will take you away from the world she will separate you from the world she will put you in love with him you will be reading the Bible foreign [Music] foreign I I read for you last time this quote I failed to read it again said not for one moment do I bring a message to the people that they may follow me again oh join my church so even you people who go to preach on the streets what is the target but the one that goes to so to do what they call witnessing I'm going to bring church members [Music] isn't it [Applause] but let me tell you the true bride of Jesus Christ is not going to do it that way yet again why do we evangelize why do we preach to the laws we have only one purpose it's not for them to join our church that is nothing you can join my church and still not go to the rapture we are going to preach to them so that we can introduce to them the present truth so that we can show them Jesus Christ according to his word so that we can tell them the Rapture is very soon the coming of the Lord is very soon so that we can tell them receive the Holy Ghost are you hearing me Church if they join our church it should only be for the purpose of them being continuing on on that road path of being encouraged to pursue that is so I I even wonder let us not just be church members let us be people here who have a purpose you know why we are here we are not here to field the church I don't care whether I'm preaching to two people or 100 people what I care about is the people who have a burden and the desire to go to the Rapture if I have five of them oh I'm very satisfied but I know they are not only five in this city they're more than 100. they're more than 200 foreign [Music] Hallelujah man someone was telling me last Sunday Sunday I don't remember he was saying that choice instruments they have drums I think they are supported by whites I just smiled I said you church I've been purchased by anyone outside foreign but I'm trying to encourage you don't let your motive don't let your attitude don't let yourself we are not here for money because we have the truth to the generation are you hearing me chat you young men you ought to be on fire we all ought to be on fire whenever you have free time use it to preach somewhere give some trucks somewhere be on fire be moved by the Holy Ghost when you meet with your brothers to our generation you see when you talk about Abram we're gonna quit blame Abraham at his time he was the only reason yeah Hallelujah man that God did not destroyed he had already sent down the angels to go and destroy the city he couldn't find them foreign [Music] [Music] tree and his family God told Abraham it's all right I'm not going to destroy them I'll send these angels take them out did you know there is something similar between Sodom and Gomorrah and today in the days straight with fire it is and you know as they were coming to the to the House of Lords some young men and old men saw them and they say and they ran into the into the house of lots and the Man Came oh we want to know the Lord said these are my guests you can't do this you know we want to know and so one angel or both of them I don't know they blinded them and of course brother speaks of this and he says this has already happened in our time there were three Angels one remained with a bride and two remained went to the solomona and we find that these ones who went to Sodom and come around they blinded these people by their message they blinded them they could do Miracles their signs and one that blinded them okay this is [Music] [Music] [Music] what happened foreign would leave Catholicism saying that they're following the message no God is here among us and this is what has happened in our generation what did he do he designed Sarah's Hearts he called the new name of Abraham and what did he do there right there and then they had their body changes because of this Angel's message let me tell you we do in our generation we have received an end-time message no one has sent to us that Angels an angel means a messenger with a message Amen to prepare us for the coming of the Lord do we have anybody at all foreign [Music] foreign [Music] when Abraham received that message please come please the only thing I want to know about it is my messenger and I want to know the message because this is the message of my house I may never get it again brethren we have the message let us seize the moment and be serious I don't know if you are getting something so he said I'm not making a church some fellowship organization I have never done that and I will never do that I have no interest in those things but I do have an interest in the things of God and the people and if I can accomplish just one thing I would be satisfied that one thing is to see established a true spiritual relationship between God and Men [Music] to establish a true spiritual relationship between God and Men where men become New Creations filled with the spirit and live according to the world so if you don't have the Holy Ghost you are not a part of those that have attained his purpose let me tell you if you don't have the Holy Spirit you need to know that you [Music] you will be okay forgive me for speaking please but I'm telling you the truth I believe you will love me better when I tell you the truth whether you're my brother whether my friends I'm telling you the truth don't just come to church for the sake of some of some associations to get a relationship with yourself whatever we do that is when we invite youth conferences that is the aim is we have free services in the week that is if we learn to pray that is to get a relationship with God to be filled with the Holy Spirit man the the Genesis chapter 6 verse 13 with Genesis chapter 6 and verses 13. and God said unto Noah the end of All Flesh has come before me for the Earth is filled with violence through them and be behold I will destroy them with the Earth make thee an arc of gopher wood rooms shall thou make in the ark and Shout preach it with within and without with Peach and this is the fashion which Thou shalt make it off the length of the ACT shall be 300 cubits the breadth of the Ark 50 qubits and the height of its uh of it 30 cubits a window shut down make to the ark and in a cubit shall thou finish it above and the door of the Ark shalt thou set in the side of thereof with lower second and third stories short thou make it and I be and behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the Earth To Destroy All Flesh water in is the Breath of Life from under heaven and everything that is in the Earth shall die but with thee will I establish my Covenant and thou shalt come into the ark thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy son his wives with thee and over there and of every living thing of All Flesh two of every thought shalt thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall make they shall be mere and female or false after they are kind and of cut after they are kind and of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind two of every thought shall come unto thee to keep them alive and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and it shall be for food for thee and for them thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so did he I see you've been reading now I want you to see that Noah had Specific Instructions when God told Noah to make the ark this was not a usual Act it was an arc with the instructions from God did not mind who agreed with him oh who disagree no I was only following one voice the voice of God instructed him and told him how the ACT should be [Music] the type of wood type of Windows and everything is God had told him how it should be and why did God tell him to do this because God was telling Noah to prepare people because it was going to rain so what was the message of the hour at that time it is going to rain that was the message now many people do not believe it then everybody did not accept it one of the reasons why is because it had never happened before [Music] but with God there is no new thing under the Earth to God this was not true because it was out of the mouth of God it wasn't new because it was out of the mouth of God but it was true whatever God speaks is true there was no proof at the time that it could happen but building the ark was the only provided way in that day yeah and I want to say in every generation God has a provided he sends them the message that is very far away from their reality now the things that the Bible says [Music] and real real woman says many of you think it is teaching can I tell you today it is it has nothing to do with William Brothers I've discussed this with some of you where he said under no circumstances that is not here because we know that the Israel was natural but for us we Are Spiritual Church did you hear that who are they barely bound to church they were Canaanites they were not of their [Music] um of their tribe of their lineage and he wanted to marry from a manga he is and it was a very important thing he said to Elias but it was a very difficult thing the place where he was going to go look for a wife because he gave his word he believed in God foreign was it what he did he went in one corner I know we again and he prayed he said God have mercy on me I asked for a sign that one sister that will come and I will ask her to water my camels to give me water to drink [Music] and she also Waters my camels ah that will be a sign Lord is the one you have given me for my masters the Bible doesn't say that she tried very many again he just stood there yeah and was looking and when her his heart move um foreign from the beginning is the same who gave wives if we follow the same way the same conditions that somebody else we need the same conditions God will do the same thing that he did for them oh if he doesn't do it he did the mistake in the beginning do you know you have a right to tell him um I'm like so and so in the Bible I don't have a child on my own and yet I'm married now let me go to church and pray come and pray and pray and then you say God I've made the same condition um and you take that from your heart yourself if God doesn't give you a child like he gave to Hannah either you've not met the same condition oh God did the mistake that's got the mistakes is it the same um he will do the same thing over and over he will never get gathered because of the same God College in the church meet the conditions and then see if God will not do the same thing that's the good thing about our God by the way let me tell you church as I'm finishing our God is very predictable cartoon very predictive foreign what are you hearing me don't it's only you is unpredictable God is only counting on you all your choices and decisions why am I saying You can predict God go in the Bible read character after character this one did this okay and God has always done the same thing no new things so friends even in marriage You can predict God before you are disappointed with God to the scriptures all those people who got married [Music] but like I say this is just the beginning I I trust that God will help us to get deeper and deeper into the subject and see of course as much as he wants you to get you will get let us stand on our feet name Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord foreign I'd like us to first prayer do you have any need that you'd like to bring before the Lord [Music] let us ask him Lord Jesus we want to come before you this evening father this has been a little broken down message tonight but Lord you can be able to put the pieces together and give your children exactly what they designed foreign and make it a reality into their hearts father Lord you know that the only purpose I also have because the only reason that I have to stand behind this sacred death Clause is that your people shall have a relationship with you they receive the spirit of God in the image of Jesus Christ that when you come Lord at that day yeah we shall be found ready ready in Jesus name amen amen can you switch can you switch just a little bit yes all right I'd like us to sing Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me amen Jesus I'll never forget what you've done for me will Jesus I never forget oh Jesus I'll never forget how you
