[1:23:53] let us pray that she will be a light
[1:23:58] amen so this morning I'm having a
[1:24:01] thought
[1:24:03] which says I cancel thee Angie
[1:24:07] I canceled
[1:24:12] I cancel there I don't know whether that
[1:24:13] is the perfect interpretation if it is
[1:24:15] not
[1:24:16] yeah yeah maybe
[1:24:19] I can't
[1:24:21] I'm against
[1:24:22] Uber
[1:24:25] okay I realize here in Psalms it says
[1:24:34] okay let me go a little bit ahead of
[1:24:36] myself and read with you just that
[1:24:38] portion of Revelation 3.
[1:24:47] we see what it says
[1:24:57] Revelation 3
[1:24:59] um
[1:25:00] read verses uh
[1:25:05] 18. because
[1:25:36] but I always Endeavor to maybe preach
[1:25:39] for one hour
[1:25:43] our Prophet advised us preachers to
[1:25:46] preach for at least 40 minutes
[1:25:56] so because after 40 minutes 45 minutes
[1:26:00] some concentration people's
[1:26:02] concentration goes down
[1:26:08] sometimes we lose time
[1:26:12] and we can even preach for two hours
[1:26:16] we don't even realize the preacher
[1:26:18] preached for two hours
[1:26:33] foreign
[1:26:47] means uh to give advice to someone
[1:26:52] or give professional help and advice to
[1:26:55] someone to resolve some personal or
[1:26:58] psychological problems
[1:27:06] you know it can also mean to recommend a
[1:27:10] cause of action
[1:27:15] now in the Book of Psalms chapter 1
[1:27:19] where we have read it it speaks of the
[1:27:21] ungodly
[1:27:26] and he talks about the Council of the
[1:27:29] ungodly
[1:27:33] and the Bible says the man that does not
[1:27:37] work in the Council of the argumentative
[1:27:45] he even said the man that does not stand
[1:27:48] in the way of Sinners
[1:27:59] but he said but his law is the light
[1:28:02] augmented
[1:28:03] his Delights
[1:28:06] is in the law of the Lord
[1:28:10] in the law of the Lord he meditates both
[1:28:40] his fruit in his season
[1:28:44] now I wanted to realize here this is not
[1:28:47] the season of the man
[1:28:51] this is the season
[1:28:58] [Music]
[1:29:17] the problem is many of us don't wait for
[1:29:21] God is Susan
[1:29:25] want our season
[1:29:28] for things to happen when we want them
[1:29:30] to happen to be together
[1:29:32] and when it doesn't happen when we won
[1:29:37] we begin grumbling We Begin complaining
[1:29:41] We Begin memory
[1:29:43] God does not like that
[1:29:47] God loves those
[1:29:50] that are planted in him
[1:29:53] wait for the season of God
[1:29:57] you remember when God found that tree
[1:30:03] it was not the season for it to bear
[1:30:05] fruit
[1:30:08] you understand
[1:30:11] he wanted the fruit it was his season
[1:30:17] but not the season of the tree
[1:30:20] so what did he do when he didn't find
[1:30:24] fruit
[1:30:25] there and there yeah
[1:30:27] he said from today you will no one will
[1:30:30] ever eat of you
[1:30:33] I want fruit
[1:30:37] but if we are planted in Christ
[1:30:41] amen we must bear fruit in his sisters
[1:30:45] but the problem is we will over Mama
[1:30:48] over delayed
[1:31:52] foreign
[1:31:54] they don't do it with all their hearts
[1:31:59] I knew you would be seated here
[1:32:02] so what are you doing right now
[1:32:07] let your heart be here
[1:32:10] I am preaching let me preach with all my
[1:32:12] heart
[1:32:17] to all your problems be outside
[1:32:22] to be able to receive the full blessings
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:47] and his season will come for you to pay
[1:32:52] a fruit
[1:32:53] foreign
[1:33:20] not some of the things he does see see
[1:33:24] whatsoever he does not your neighbor
[1:33:27] whatsoever
[1:33:31] let me ask you a question
[1:33:32] let us be sincere now for just a moment
[1:33:35] do all the things you do prosperity
[1:33:41] be sincere with yourself
[1:33:48] which Council are you receiving
[1:33:51] the Bible says blessed is
[1:34:00] so it will suffice to say the
[1:34:04] temperature we do sometimes don't
[1:34:06] prosperity
[1:34:09] because we are not working according to
[1:34:12] the cancer of God
[1:34:14] we are working according to the cancer
[1:34:17] of the UN God
[1:34:27] I want to read them for you a few maybe
[1:34:30] the brother can project them out of
[1:34:31] Psalms
[1:34:37] just do it quickly and go through them
[1:34:43] though it's this is it's already in the
[1:34:45] sums you could open it the wicked in his
[1:34:47] pride does persecute the poor let them
[1:34:51] be taken in the devil says that they
[1:34:53] have imagined for the wicked boasteth of
[1:34:55] his heart is desire and blesses the
[1:34:57] confessions whom the Lord abhorth the
[1:35:01] wicked through the pride of his
[1:35:02] continents will not seek after God and
[1:35:05] is not in all and God is not in all his
[1:35:08] thoughts Psalms 10 too foreign
[1:35:44] he says he will not seek after God
[1:35:48] you know God is not in all his thoughts
[1:35:52] I wanted to remember
[1:35:54] the things I've been doing this week
[1:36:01] is
[1:36:04] you know in Romans it says because they
[1:36:07] did not retain God in their minds
[1:36:12] God gave them to vile affections
[1:36:21] to do those things which are hands
[1:36:26] people do wrong things because they

[2:13:25] I believe three foreign
[2:14:27] David had died
[2:14:29] and Solomon his son took over sins
[2:14:33] and Solomon did a big mistress to remind
[2:14:36] in accordance
[2:14:38] Solomon married many wives so the man
[2:14:40] did I was
[2:14:42] together with all the consumers with
[2:14:45] about a thousand of them
[2:14:49] but here was the problem
[2:14:51] mad at these women
[2:14:54] from the heat types
[2:14:59] and all those other tribes that God told
[2:15:03] the Believers not to marry from
[2:15:08] Solomon married
[2:15:15] these women overpowered him
[2:15:20] and they began to teach him the ways
[2:16:13] [Applause]
[2:16:22] foreign only one king or One Tribe
[2:16:25] rather one tries that is the time of
[2:16:28] Judah in Jerusalem why because of my
[2:16:32] servant David
[2:16:35] why because David followed the cancer of
[2:16:38] God
[2:16:40] so if you follow the curse of God
[2:16:43] you are securing Prosperity
[2:16:55] can you imagine that some of you brother
[2:16:59] sisters
[2:17:00] you need to start breaking cycles
[2:17:05] that have been in your family
[2:17:09] sometimes you carry something from your
[2:17:11] father
[2:17:13] from his father
[2:17:15] something was done in the past
[2:17:18] I mean it gets carried over to you
[2:17:22] because of someone
[2:18:05] need to make decisions foreign
[2:19:01] Solomon was blessed
[2:19:05] um
[2:19:07] when Solomon came on the sins
[2:19:12] I'm not going to let you build my
[2:19:14] temples
[2:19:16] because you have too much blood on your
[2:19:18] hands
[2:19:24] listen to me
[2:19:28] David
[2:19:29] was blessed
[2:19:32] and the blessing that when God shows
[2:19:35] that you are blessed
[2:19:38] here is what proves it says the blessing
[2:19:42] of God um
[2:19:55] not the richest today
[2:19:57] and tomorrow
[2:20:28] fell in things
[2:20:43] he found already made things and God
[2:20:47] received him and allowed him to build
[2:20:49] the temples
[2:20:52] then he went to serving other gods
[2:21:29] [Music]
[2:21:55] I still remember what they promised
[2:22:19] imagine someone coming in your blessings
[2:22:22] and walking in you need the way he wants
[2:22:26] [Music]
[2:22:29] that's what God does
[2:22:35] God wants to make sure you see it
[2:22:38] I could feel the pain when Solomon had
[2:22:42] that he quickly rushed to kill his
[2:22:46] servant
[2:22:48] I think he was name is
[2:22:53] but if God has said he is saying
[2:22:56] and you could not kill him
[2:23:03] and later on Solomon died a man enough
[2:23:08] and now Katie after he has died
[2:23:13] I want us to read what happened
[2:23:17] we see what how cancer is very important
[2:23:24] don't enter into anything important
[2:23:26] without cancer

[2:23:40] praise the name of the Lord
[2:23:47] I might have mixed up the names there
[2:23:50] but
[2:23:51] butham is the son of Solomon

[2:33:15] we don't stand a chance because
[2:33:16] everything God has predetermined it is
[2:33:25] I don't have to do anything this is
[2:33:29] what I do will not matter
[2:33:33] God has already
[2:33:38] foreign
[2:33:55] awaken there is when God speaks to
[2:33:58] prophet ahija
[2:34:01] he came to the jeroboam
[2:34:05] and he told him because of what Solomon
[2:34:09] did
[2:34:11] I'm going to reap his kingdom
[2:34:14] but I will live uh I will leave
[2:34:19] with Judah and
[2:34:47] [Applause]
[2:35:14] this is somebody who knew what the
[2:35:16] prophet had said
[2:35:19] he knew the Council of God
[2:35:22] and he came to the king robot bow
[2:35:28] [Music]
[2:35:45] what is going to happen is that the
[2:35:47] kingdom is going to be ripped
[2:35:49] that it could have been true
[2:35:52] but when prophecy is given
[2:35:56] prophecy can be reverted
[2:35:59] can I give you an example
[2:36:03] when God spoke to
[2:36:05] um Jonah
[2:36:07] he told him
[2:36:09] and tell them I'm going to destroy all
[2:36:11] of them
[2:36:14] did he destroy them
[2:36:17] was the professor
[2:36:20] because they repented
[2:36:24] here
[2:36:25] you wanna know this professor was a
[2:36:27] professor yes
[2:36:28] but there is one man
[2:36:32] would have stopped it from happening
[2:36:36] and that was
[2:36:42] only one thing to do
[2:36:45] to hear right
[2:36:50] Council
[2:36:53] you would have stopped his kingdom from
[2:36:55] ripping
[2:36:58] yes
[2:37:06] he also stood the chance
[2:37:10] but when he went to to hear cancer
[2:37:14] he had the cancer of the older men
[2:37:18] and he refused to believe it
[2:37:21] went to the younger ones yeah
