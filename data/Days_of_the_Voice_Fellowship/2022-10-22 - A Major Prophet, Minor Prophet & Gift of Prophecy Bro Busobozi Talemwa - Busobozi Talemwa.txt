========================================

standing why don't you take your Bibles [Music] foreign I must give this concerning signing the pattern of God that's what we want us to want to do for us today is for the sake of our reading tonight we shall just read verse 7.50 yeah surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealed his secret unto his servants the prophets amen Lord Jesus we permit the scripture that we have read in the future to commit ourselves to go into a little bible study tonight to each and every one of us here we may be seated so I will just I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ I've made it tonight and so I I have a lot to cover and I'll just go straight into the scripture I'm requesting people decide if you can check this site for at least 39. amen Amina and so tonight I'm going to speak on a Major Prophets and I give the prophets I don't know I don't know okay we will understand as we go along I know someone interpreter so there are many interpretations to eat but uh I like Brother Martin said we want to look at a major prophet or a prophet of the age why are you getting the drugs uh explain it here if you're wrong in Spanish the prophetic or prophecy is a wonderful thing to the church a wonderful gift to the church in general [Music] and brother Ken spoken spoke about a voice and he he spoke about the the voice of the Prophet we should hear the voice whenever God sends a prophet he expects us to hear his voice but you see that this one has been used and misused in our generation that we do not uh understand its meaning anymore [Music] until that some people are really allergic to it and they do not want to hear it because to them a prophet is somebody who deceives others and takes their money in the name of speaking in the name of the Lord [Music] especially in our generation I'm also here in Uganda Uganda we have a lot of people calling themselves prophet and others even call themselves Major Prophets and so then you do not understand but I want us to look at this in a scriptural point of view does God still use prophets that's prophecy still happened today what is prophecy anyway but I would like us to see that in the Book of Amos he begins by saying surely the Lord God will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets so now in every generation and I would like you to follow me closely because you will be doing some quotes and scriptures on Wednesday we usually have a Bible study whatever you want to call it but I hope that we all have our spiritual antennas tuned tonight amen are you all right brother amen foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] they reached that time and they wanted that King like the people of the land the promised land one word and they said we want a king to rule us just like in other kingdoms initially the plan and the pattern of God was to lead his people by a prophets says or a prophet whatever you want to call it a prophet is a compound word one argument is just like sanctification is a compound word it means green and set aside and so there's many words and especially in English the words that are compounds [Music] so you see that is under inspiration but also a prophecy could mean or a prophet is somebody that foresee something and also in another message here the identification of Christ in all ages he says in the beginning he spoke to the prophets and the word of the Lord came to the prophets and the prophet being able to foretell Divine things and it happened just like that was his identification means one who fought tells or tails forth is a Divine interpreter of the written word anybody knows anybody that knows that knows what a prophet means now the English word Prophet is a preacher chicken just anybody preaching is a prophet of the Old Testament which was referred to as a prophet he was the one that forced things he said if there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I the Lord will make myself known unto him and what he says shall come to pass and what it says if it comes to pass then hear him actually in the Old Testament if somebody came up and said I am a prophet and and I'm speaking in the name of the Lord and he said something and it never came to pass they stunned him to death because the prophet had to be Asia the word of the Lord came to him a lot of what he said was touted or supposed to be doubted everything he said was that say it alone is born in the world he is ordained for ordained of God to do that because gifts and callings are without repentance how we are going to look and address this tonight we are going to cut it into three phases I'd like us to first of all look at our prophet then we look at a minor prophet and then we look at the gift of Prophecy time will Allah then we see the differences and what works when and what we have in our generation and what we must have in our time how can I expect them tonight hey man this is a good subject for us as Believers of the message now in the message says there never was in the age any two Major Prophets on the earth at one time [Music] and Elijah was the prophet until Elijah came back then when Elijah was taking off a portion another portion of Elijah's Spirit the light rather Elijah's Spirit Came Upon her life now we want to see the first thing is when looking at a major prophetic there is usually in every generation one major prophet God has to send one according to almost three what did he says surely the Lord God will do nothing foreign foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] that Jesus there is no profit but the Bible I read tells me that our God is the same and he never changes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever the god of the Jehovah of the Old Testament again is the Jesus of the new yes because whatever he thinks is perfect the first time [Music] that's why the Bible the Bible does not have another Edition the Bible is there is the one true word of God people can write many versions of it according to their understanding of this Bible is one it's the word of God that does not change it requires today so we see that God uses Major Prophets there is a Moses Jeremiah Elijah you can go on and on are you and these were all prophets in our generation but God did not use a Daniel and an Isaiah in the same generation he did not use a Samuel and a Moses at the same time in one generation you know what the other people are saying it's not from your opinion if there are people [Music] with one one purpose anybody tried to run away from that calling me God tell it with them and even after that they had to go until because they were born prophets Anointed with the spirit they were born to prophesy speak the word of God it is foreign [Applause] he couldn't help being a Moses God sent him down and gave him life on Earth and all the Pharaohs in the world couldn't have killed himself when their work is no matter how they died he gave his message his voice was the voice of God they killed him foreign are you here you must know your Bible to you hallelujah amen Jeremiah chapter one you know Jeremiah was one of the Major Prophets of the Lord came unto me saying before I formed thee in the belly I knew this is amen the prophets did not need the ordination of the council the process did not need you know the crowning of the society or the denominations [Music] foreign unto thee I Prophet from the midst of thee of thy Brethren like unto me unto him you shall hey praise the name of the Lord and Moses are the prophet he was prophesying and he was saying there will one day be another Prophet like unto me one of you hmm remember that God told Moses I will not be only a prophet with them but you will be gone and so he was a prophet god cartoon and now here he was giving a prophecies foreign and when he came in John 14 11 he said believe that I am in the father anyone else believe me for the very Works did you see how Vindicated how prophets have Vindicated Hallelujah Amina and he tried to show them he was the god yeah he told them he was the son of mine he was mine too so what was he trying to say yeah he was going to be clear I'm the prophet God that mother spoke about but did they understand did they believe it but they did not understand it again they did not understand him but his own received him but to as many as received here to become the son of Christ [Applause] at least if you can't believe what I'm saying let me show you the proof I am here foreign I mean Hallelujah Matthew 11 2. my name is now when John had her when John had heard if I wanted to get it in the Bible have a very big Bible in in in in your in your place it says Matthew 11 3 says now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him after thou he that should come oh do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which ye do here and see them yes [Music] find receive their site [Music] the poor have the gospel reached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me what did the scripture say that when the Messiah comes will do [Music] when John was in the prison he sent the people to go and ask whether Jesus was that Prophet which he expected to come yes to really think about this for a moment a man who declared that this is Jesus and he's telling his followers go and find out whether he's the one but just go and ask him directly [Music] it seems the story has not become like a Pharisee foreign [Music] go and find out boys that I announced to the people so that if it's not the right one then I can apologize I give a public apology foreign [Music] do you know the Vindication of Batman [Music] yeah does it speak of him and so here comes Jesus yes he didn't begin pumping his chest I am the one let me do some some kind of uh uh uh mathematic for you so you can see that I am the one that is and he didn't even do the things he he could have done but you see the things that was written about him you have to understand that we as children of God are not supposed to do things that are are not written of us we are shooting of God are here to fulfill that which was written about us foreign we must manifest Christ to renew God exactly we must bring forth his nature his life praise the name of the Lord and Jesus was standing there yesterday and he he called a sick night time but I prayed for them he went to the lamb prayed for themselves foreign called himself Elijah Williams show me any Scripture where William Branham or any quote because all the messages of William Panama recorded the game again foreign [Music] [Music] the only way to vindicate a major prophet is whether or not he fulfills what is written of him let me ask you a question how many of you were in the denominations foreign foreign does it mean that because there is a major prophet in our generation God does not use others as prophets in the message is what it says to watch when they go to Kadesh paneer cartoon Moses sent out one of the of his tribes see which way they was to enter and he sent his General Joshua which was a prophet now what's that Moses foreign March the engineer during the time of prophet Moses even if it is not recorded what is important is the message of the major prophet the message of the Minor Prophets to individuals such a normal individual churches are getting all individual areas certain things but the message of the major prophet is a message to the whole world the whole world the whole world has to hear that message the whole world has to believe that message and if they don't believe it there is repercussions maybe God can use me or God can use somebody else to give a message to Uganda Uganda such and such will happen they don't even need to be Believers of the message gifts and callings of God without repentance and so don't think that this idea of prophets is is supposed to be those in your circles or those that believe what you believe that's why many people did not believe William blatnam because he did not come from their groups you know he didn't come from their group and yet he went in every one of their groups until one time they were so confused the Oneness we are saying the Oneness we are saying are you one of us really if you're one of us what are you doing yeah we have accepted you as a prophet of God choice that both of you are wrong and I am right beside you to Italian you you want to make God like as if he's a bunch of great cartoon you you want to say that he said there is a separate God who is the father because you want to baptize calling the name of each of those three gods and you are mistaken to think that father son Holy Ghost are his names to you my Oneness Brothers you understand that God is [Music] that but you are wrong when it comes to baptism because you simply baptized in the name of Jesus he said Jesus is the man but we know that Jesus was more than a man he has a title God himself so he was the Lord Jesus Christ and so he says I I don't believe your baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ and that is the interpretation of father son holy God and all the Oneness we are scratching their heads and he's still associated with all of them because he was a prophet he was sent to all of them a prophet comes from no denominations [Music] that's why I let them come foreign [Applause] foreign from around him tied his hand and said thus saith the Lord yep the man that he the man and here he was his Professor the man that this has bound will be bound in Chains when he gets to Jerusalem um seeing the visions of the people then to read of Paul storms he told them said don't lose from this place and go because it will be to your harm now we all know that when Paul reached in Jerusalem he was born in Chains and here is a foreign foreign uh Prophets who are anointed to give the prophets of in Acts chapter 21 it says and as we tore it there many days there came down from Judea a certain Prophet named and when he was come unto us he took Paul's garden and bound his own hands and feed and said thus saith the Holy Ghost so shall the Jews of Jerusalem bind the man that owned this garden and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles foreign [Music] praise the name of the Lord so that was a photographers and in a message um religious dream a museum he says now you said well the prophets are the of the Old Testament okay the New Testament had the prophets was a new testament Prophet look at the Spirit of Prophecy falling down there and telling Paul about it from Jerusalem and found Paul and tie this gather around him and turn over and say thus says the Lord the man that all this will be bowing chains when he gets to Jerusalem not be just like we have pastors to me we also have the office of course men and women who are supposed to be perfect and they can prophesy In The Name Of The Lord foreign do you believe it foreign [Music] foreign he is Hallelujah I mean and you are not supposed to follow his message like life and death uh why because you already have a message and that is [Music] America some other place or even or even in moment it will not be affected by my message foreign [Music] hey man I mean so if a pastor comes and says I'm the prophet here begins to preach things that are not in the message but can prophesy you see now this is a gift to professors it's among the nine spiritual gifts and this is what you find in many of the Pentecostals and they mistake it for Prophets so let me let us go through this then we shall conclude after that Solomon is here um now there is a lot of difference between a gift to prophecy and the prophet is the prophecy may be on one night on one tonight it's them nine spiritual gifts that works in the body area but a prophet is Born the prophet all done through their life someone just walk over to you [Music] foreign my speed must be judged and then he says but you've never seen anybody to judge them no but the Bible said if one prophesies let two or three judge whether it is right or not because Saturn can sleep yes now we have the word of wisdom word of knowledge this designing our Spirits prophecy diverse kinds of tongues and the production of tongues Faith healing of Miracles are you following me are you here foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] coffee that's wisdom now that's a revelation there's a word of knowledge understood what brother had and they thought he had word of knowledge what he had was more than a word of knowledge foreign [Music] just think and then you give a profit if you have ever given a prophecy of the Prophet you will notice oh that is also speaking in tongues and giving a prophecy this is you understand the word of knowledge or wisdomania everybody is but one of them has a gift you understand I believe when when Solomon passed the Judgment many people must have laughed but the gift of Prophecy speaking in tongues this is inspirational it comes with inspiration you know when a preacher stands here he's asked me a gift to Professor it must be inspired it's not dry yeah it's not from him according to your prayers foreign I'll give you examples here first was one of them Hallelujah I wanted to hear the prophet of escape and one of them in John 11 49 and one of them named Caiaphas being the high priest that same year I say unto them ye know nothing at all no consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people and that the world nation perished foreign [Music] foreign foreign so the prophets can be given by the good and the bad that's why it has to be jacket where that is right or wrong oh I love the Lord don't you love the Lord I'll give you another example here he wanted to kill David and hear this in first Samuel chapter 19 verse 18. so David flat and escape and told him that all Soul had done to him and he and so Samuel went and dwelt in Niles and it was told Saul saying behold David is at Nile in Rama and so send Messengers to David and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying and uh excuse me and Samuel was standing as appointed over them the spirit of the Lord was upon the messengers of soul and they also prophesied foreign and I believe they even maybe had swords they were sent to go catch him alive or dead the boys I mean David was hidden question is you know Samuel was a prophet and I believe there were many other Minor Prophets we are all in one company foreign thank you what were they prophets no the spirit of Prophecy had just come upon him let us continue this is amazing and when Saul was told about peace he sent other Messengers and they prophesied also likewise everybody and the Soul said the messages your majesty oh which team send me I'll bring that boy here okay go ahead again this is the third time the third time is usually the perfect time proof and they prophesied also now even knows a big group of younger people and all people prophesying each other oh my God I mean whoever is today I must have said this is himself said let me go myself let me go myself a shortage and he came to a great way that is insectful and they asked and said where are somewhere and David where are these boys and the spirit of the Lord was upon him foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] the Bible says he stripped off his clothes hallelujah amen and he laid down naked whatever they say it is [Laughter] hallelujah amen was it of God it works it was a man a prophet no um where there are some people who were going to judge this purpose of course why do I want this somewhere so they could tell the others Hallelujah and the man was the enemy of David but there he was the whole night sorry [Applause] and everybody was shocked his soul also has it become one of them that's how the Pentecostals are confused when they prophesy like that they think they're also prophets and they said they don't need William Brothers [Music] because this man prophesied like this he did not repress somewhere Samuel was still there somewhere else in Acts chapter 21 verse and when we had finished our course from Tire we came to uh solemis and saluted the Brethren and Abode with them one day and the next day we we that way of Paul's company departed and came unto Syria and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist which was one of the seven and Abode with him and the same man had four daughters pageants which they professor Netflix [Music] foreign let the boys prophesy Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord these things are ours we need to be afraid for our children and our grandchildren these gifts are not only for Pentacles actually the True Church of Jesus Christ of denomination Pentecost it can you say into foreign praise the name of the Lord and these prophets have Vindicated in First Corinthians 14 29 where he says let them be judged with that and let us read this as the last scripture in First Corinthians 14 293 let the prophet speak two or three and let the other judge if anything be revealed to another that seated by let the first hold his peace and for ye may all prophesy one by one that all may learn and all and that all may be comforted and that the spirit of prophets are subject to the prophets for God is not the author of confusion but of Peace as in all the churches of the Saints um praise the Lord come here let us convert Prophets but we thank God for the prophet of Yahoo without this we don't have a guiding campus thank you who can stand against the king no one can we [Music] who can stand against the king [Music] no one comes [Music] oh
