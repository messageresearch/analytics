Hebrews chapter 11 and um we are really just reading one verse together are you are you there yet if you're there just say Amen what does all right so we read together verse six we can begin from verse 5. by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God is a which we shall really dwell on but for now let us ask God to bless his one and then you'll be seated father we commit this word into your hands that we have read these people into your hands as well give me the grace Lord to speak to them that the word will penetrate their hearts direct my thoughts and everything Lord and give us a good atmosphere that your holy spirit will be pleased with us this morning Father we ask this blessing in Jesus name praise the Lord now I'd like to bring greetings to you in the name of Jesus Christ this morning when you greet your neighbor and tell them God bless you so uh this morning um I'm happy that you prayed for me and I'm back safely the ones who prayed for me I want to say God bless you God answered your prayers that I'm back when I'm well amen and not only that but also God gave us wonderful a wonderful time in Germany Germany we really had a uh it was a supernatural weekend for me you know in the meetings there we had a lot of Believers and ministers and people coming in from different countries the meetings were hosted by the pastor in Germany brother God Road who has been in the message for quite very many years maybe almost 50 now um and so uh we had the ministers and Saints from Belgium from Italy England Germany Russia Poland Ukraine Ukraine notice you were in a meeting in one in one of the services we had a prayer line and one of the pastors that was with us on the prayer line um was a pastor Sagi from Russia Moscow and some believers who are coming to be prayed for we are from Ukraine and you know in Ukraine and Russia they speak the same language and so these people could not be able to express themselves in in Germany or in English had to interpret for brother Timothy and the rest of us uh um for these people from Russian or stroke Ukrainian to to to English those of us who know what is happening in Russia and Ukraine you're like that is impossible but that's confirmed to me in the believer's world we are completely in another world we are living in the world truly but we are not of the world no matter what is going on in the politics of the regions or the politics of the world the believer is not really that much affected because what affects us is what is in our world and I'm glad to be a part of this world where there was war in Ukraine praying for ukrainians that have been maybe lost their families or lost things or lost and he's praying for them and comforting them in the Lord that means that we are citizens of another country we had most of the services uh uh on the weekend preached by the team and brother Timothy orange and brother God asked me to preach the first service on I think it was on a Friday we agree that it will be the appetizer for the services but I was really humbled I mean there were many many ministers who would have stood chance God gave us Grace I know that some of you streamed that service and those who did not get a chance because you know in Germany they are not like in the U.S or other uh capitalist countries have kind of a way that they do their own things are not difficult for some of you to even access the service because it was you have to sign in on our website to access it I requested brother God I said brother God would it be okay for me to stream uh the weekend of these meetings on our Channel on YouTube kids foreign is when sorry 9 pm today basically I was giving my testimony and gave a little exportation and then uh the rest of the meetings will also follow I think we'll announce to you when or you just keep checking on the channel it will be uploaded there and then you can be able to stream it and share it with others it was a blessing and so I also had a wonderful time you know brother Tim brother Tim fruit is a man that has preached this message for more than 50 years and if I've seen invited him in one of his meetings in Canada [Music] speaking of about the ministry and you know like I I can say that he was imparting on me all the years of his ministry and I really felt it was a big blessing for me brothers from here in Uganda and basically in Africa that go to Europe or to America to to receive a money impartation and I was really very embarrassed as they were telling me of some of these names of people from here keep writing letters what I told these brothers I said look Brothers because I understand that this came in from a long history Uganda and I really need to tell you this is but he failed to come because of War now and at the time you know Uganda was kind of uh broken into many pieces people did not have clothes people did not have food they didn't even have time to cultivate them and so they wouldn't have education we were broken down because of you know it was like a war-ton country in Colorado some of the brothers that came here those many years ago and so all they could do was to support give money support give money for everything you know they have to come and preach meetings they have to rent a building like this so they have to pay because food for preachers you see what I believe with all my heart that we have moved from them we might not have attained what they have attained but we are no longer where Uganda was 30 40 years ago I spoke to the Brethren and I told them this is another generation we are in another generation and I told them I mean like I never have known brother God for very many years and they say to him I mean like I've never written you to ask for any money but I had needs everybody has needs whether they are white or black but we need to have a realization that the god of the whites The God Who bless them and so I clearly put it to the Brethren together and I told them if there is anything I've come for here once you invited me do I desire to come because but the temple was going to be in this meeting because I was really immensely blessed and we had a good a real good time in discussing about the ministry and about you know the work of the Lord and his experience over there several friends some of which are are going to come and visit us I said if you came to Uganda you will be the first preacher from Russia to come to him how many would like to see him the message oh my I'm telling you you would say well this message is from American is a Russian and a Russian America you know oh how come let me tell you this message is not American message this message is from the mind of God and so there's a lot that we can talk about the trip but I think I'll not take more time I want us to just go right into the world but I want to appreciate the ministers Brother Martin brother luang Gabba the Joel and the other musicians and the brothers that have really students I've heard that you've had wonderful meetings [Music] so this morning I just want to continue you remember time I left on the power part 2. so I ended up speaking on on it but I did not go into the what I wanted to go into so I'll this is like part three but it will really be the second part of that service so please go back to the Village Hebrews 11 movies [Music] now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen for by it the elders obtained a good report through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear s by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than that of Cain is by which you obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gifts and by it he being dead yet by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and he continued stressing the point it was by Faith by faith in the land can you imagine an offering David is a natural way why you cannot give to God an offering and God accepts it if it is not by faith it must be by faith if it is God can never accept your sacrifice well if you're hearing me you better say Amen praise the name of the Lord so everything that we do as a Believers must be by faith it is impossible to please every one of us let us read verses six together one two three go but without faith but without faith let us do it again maybe you are not there yet let us do it again now puts it all under one umbrella we're gonna play them you'll never take our one so I'm talking when he said what is faith in the message the anointed ones at the end time faith is something that is revealed to you five is something that is revealed to you praise the name of the Lord come here let me tell you something can be open that should be good but we're not revealed when the sales were removed and the book is an open book the book is full of promises full of you know what God has promised his children the book is showing us what we are going to be together the book is demonstrating what a child of God must be now everything in that open books because God has said it is not good to you foreign [Music] people when some something is revealed to you could be people will try to talk you out of it I will try to make you as a fail as if you were a failure oh but because you have faith because you see what they don't see because you know what they don't know is revealed to you praise the name of the Lord faith is a revelation from God faith is a revelation tell your neighbor faith is a revelation of you tell somebody come on it is a revelation he has revealed it to you by his grace it is given to you by the grace of God hallelujah amen and God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation and the whole Church of God is built upon them and how does faith Hallelujah man how does faith come oh foreign it is time for it to happen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah yes sir the moment something is it is one of the examples um I will read from the message out from the message uh wax is no no no just a moment I'll get the message I want to read from uh wax is Faith expressed yes I wanted to listen to these words man I mean and as I'm preaching to you maybe some of you will surface that moment when you receive it say Amen because that moment something is before I talk about Davis from where he came from to come in Israel and when he arrived there the reason why he came was because he had there was a prophet of God in Israel the reason why you have come it's because you know in this place is sent out to you when you hear that message without faith they know nothing will happen to you foreign Ghana foreign I need let me let me tell you the gospel engineering is not only one she became of your car the gospel words and life praise the name of the Lord Jesus did not just preach yes Jesus but he also opened the eyes of the blind he also made the lamb to work so the gospel Angel is not only what she became of your car we are not to be educated people we are not to be educated only if we are only educated message Believers we have the mechanics but we have no Dynamics which we are preaching to you Spirit your yard is alive it can create some return the life in the middle foreign you can choose to go back to Urban and fever or go and die with your Liberation or do what I said God doesn't change his words to suit our desires stop if you want to go to work do what he's watching his word is not debatable difference between the message believers denominations now here comes a man who begins to debate with the prophet and the prophet said what I say change is it wasn't even written sometimes you can come in the chance and a preacher speak to you direct um he's just excited nothing will happen nothing will happen if you receive a resolution and then maybe he speaks to you and the ministers do you in your heart let me tell you whatever he tells you to do how can I cry in the child that's what yielding yourself is not having a heart which is [Applause] Hallelujah something was revealed to us she she you know she was like this is true and when she [Music] is to the revelation God was pleased she said the right words the prophet of God also received another evidence it was a revelation we'll get to that and he spoke into her life said if she had asked for a million dollars but she asked for the Salvation and God saved all of them you have to have the right attitude Revelations seize that moment Naman was hesitant yes and he was just delaying his miracles but the moment that little girl came I love it Revelation is by inspiration she came to him and she said foreign you see the impossibility foreign [Music] oh praise the name it is yes [Applause] but you are the person who is a very lazy person you have no idea business ideas foreign your confessions mean nothing [Applause] but if you are confessing Hallelujah if you are giving a confession by faith it must be seen by your works we prayed for Sunshine and you are coming he says now some of them said I know you are naughty his brother said you come up here to see the battle now you get on you get on back over where the them ship was and he said let me speak to Saul General admire your courage you are nothing but you are nothing but a yes [Music] but he said I was standing my father's ship yes oh it's just the same he has to reveal to you this is foreign [Music] to me I see that was Revelation he did it yeah we can be some David there can be some David's here how about I'm happy to say God bless you what can't Our God do now ask your neighbor what can't God do maybe something is revealed to your house am I the only one asking my neighbors think about that for a moment if God [Music] saw me before he was born information he is alive today as he was there amen and if he has blessed others if he has blessed us with the wives I've often heard many young people saying and I really feel sorry for this generation because without faith you are you're going to perish you have to have faith how dare you say that well that was then no more Good Guys the reason why they are more no good girls because they are no more good boys foreign foreign and we understand it is foreign and singing songs foreign it's a revelation of marriage looking for somebody to get married and somebody who wrote A married when I want let me tell you yeah everything to a child of God is a revelation foreign foreign it is a revelation we have people who have a lot of Ahmed a lot of wealth needs to be the millionaires but they still have it married they're just moving around from woman to woman with some women just getting married and sticking with one woman and paying you know bright price and doing a wedding oh it's like okay it is a Dreadful thing for them because you see they have no Revelation how can they receive Revelations because it means we are not hearing questions the Bible says casting down imagination [Applause] I've seen people but they are mean some of them are the meanest creatures give me a little gracious in churches around me in the message that inclusive why do many people suffer financially and they told me something that I said that is right he said in his church he has had a lot of people sometimes they are they're suffering financially and they would come to him and say Pastor um foreign foreign foreign [Music] I found the pastor there he is I know I'm here from here I know he said millions but the house he lives it was built I think it is as old as the USA foreign foreign specifically what I saw was from Malawi you know houses which are about to fall on people you know people who were in almost drugs people who need you know like they need food foreign the Bible says now how come you will come in a church every Sunday maybe once in a while we are looking for money to buy land do not understand but your hand is in your pockets Brothers we are collecting please are more important than the ones the little you have in your pocket is finished [Music] he will bless [Music] I think we as the days of the voice Fellowship can be an example if we choose to be days it's never too late for God to fulfill his word [Applause] let me let me let me give you another example out one day of God in a prayer and here come a thousand citizens upon him and he looked down on the ground and there is where a mule had died dry as it could be and they took it and it and took out after those Philistines not the truth foreign foreign [Music] but what did he have yeah and that Revelation amen Drew him Moses foreign there were many tacos in the camp why do everyone because of one man with Revelations imagine if you're fighting on a battlefronto he's killing on the front in the back on the side and on the left he's killing everywhere it must have been some exercise for him but it wasn't his strength it was the power of Revelation what do we have let me tell you when you receive revelation God begins to work with you using whatever you are crazy it might be small that's what you need to begin Hallelujah foreign [Music] ten thousand every month why not 100. but make sure you commit yourself I'm going to kill this Philistines we are giving all our money to somebody else and I'm really I know most of your members I'm offroading my heart to you we're giving all our money to somebody who's using you to Father his vision is some of you have children already others are going to have children where do you want your children you want them to to go in a place where it's not like a sanctuary I think parents who are here you'd rather do all you because of your confidence and say I'm going to kill this Philistines right now let me kill him not only for the church for now we're talking about the house I'm going to to give in the world so we can have our own topics and not even the job foreign I want to tell you something now work on that pulsation on that part session look work on that partition a pulsation no you're really missing it praise the name of the Lord is like a sensation okay foreign [Music]
