[1:35:22] places
[1:35:25] according as he has chosen
[1:35:28] us okay now let me read this
[1:35:31] differently according as he has chosen
[1:35:34] me now you read it that way also then it
[1:35:37] will make sense he has chosen me in him
[1:35:42] before the foundation of the
[1:35:45] world that I should be
[1:35:49] holy he already chose me to be holy
[1:35:54] the devil cannot stop me from
[1:35:57] being the Catholics when they
[1:36:01] die the pope can make some of them
[1:36:05] saints I don't know with what power he
[1:36:08] he makes them
[1:36:10] saints but our God because of
[1:36:14] predestination he has already made us
[1:36:17] s so we are already a
[1:36:21] saint I am a SA
[1:36:28] Aman
[1:36:30] Joseph Danel you say Amen if you are
[1:36:34] Saint that's why I said God bless you
[1:36:38] Saints so he has already blessed us and
[1:36:41] he has chosen Us in
[1:36:43] him before the foundation of the
[1:36:47] world this morning I want us to get into
[1:36:49] the
[1:36:50] word for us here dvf we love the word
[1:36:54] we have no business for
[1:36:56] jokes we just love the word amen how
[1:37:00] many love the
[1:37:02] word amen so if you love the word get
[1:37:04] ready to enjoy
[1:37:09] the get ready to enjoy the word this is
[1:37:12] much better than a movie
[1:37:14] my much better than a football
[1:37:17] match hallelujah amen I don't know your
[1:37:21] expectation but mine is very hard
[1:37:24] I'm getting ready to
[1:37:26] enjoy Amen
[1:37:28] brother so I want to hear your amens
[1:37:31] if so in other words he says he has
[1:37:33] chosen Us in
[1:37:35] him before the foundation of the
[1:37:38] world that we should be
[1:37:41] holy so in other words he chose us in
[1:37:44] him to be
[1:37:45] holy he chose me to be holy the devil
[1:37:49] can't stop me from being
[1:37:51] holy the condition around me cannot
[1:37:54] render me
[1:37:58] Unholy I was chosen to be
[1:38:02] holy amen Without
[1:38:05] Blame so in other words I am Holy and
[1:38:10] blameless is there anyone here like me I
[1:38:13] am Holy and blameless tell your neighbor
[1:38:17] I am Holy and
[1:38:20] blameless I was chosen to be that it is
[1:38:23] not my choice it is his choice amen it
[1:38:28] was not my decision it was his decision
[1:38:32] it was not my
[1:38:33] declaration his
[1:38:35] declaration he declared he chose he
[1:38:39] decided deter that there will be
[1:38:42] somebody that will be holy that will be
[1:38:46] blameless the devil can't do anything
[1:38:50] about amen amen yes
[1:38:54] having predestinated
[1:38:57] us un to
[1:39:00] adoption meaning he he
[1:39:04] predestinated I would be
[1:39:08] adopted
[1:39:10] predestinated that I would be a son that
[1:39:13] I would be a daughter of
[1:39:15] God so so now it means there are no
[1:39:19] things that did not happen or that has
[1:39:21] happened that can change that
[1:39:26] I was predestinated unto being
[1:39:30] adopted and the adoption of Jesus of
[1:39:33] children by Jesus
[1:39:37] Christ to himself by Jesus
[1:39:41] Christ in other words Jesus is the
[1:39:43] Difference Maker
[1:39:46] here without Jesus no
[1:39:49] adoption but because of Jesus I I was
[1:39:54] destinated to
[1:39:55] adoption by Jesus
[1:39:58] Christ
[1:40:00] according to the good
[1:40:04] pleasure of his
[1:40:06] will now you understand this is
[1:40:08] something that happens because God has
[1:40:10] willed
[1:40:12] it it is God's will for you to be
[1:40:15] perfect is God's will for you to be
[1:40:18] ho you have heard people saying no one
[1:40:20] is
[1:40:21] perfect tell them what did you say Look
[1:40:25] At Me by the way this is true me I am
[1:40:30] perfect you are perfect now remember
[1:40:33] this
[1:40:34] Perfection is regardless of your
[1:40:37] physical
[1:40:40] impurities this
[1:40:42] Perfection goes beyond what this flesh
[1:40:46] has caused
[1:40:49] you this is something that confuses
[1:40:54] it says how can someone be
[1:40:57] perfect Jesus is coming back to take a
[1:41:02] church that is without
[1:41:04] sport that is without
[1:41:06] wrinkle meaning that is a church which
[1:41:09] is
[1:41:10] perfect How can there be a church
[1:41:12] without SP without
[1:41:14] rink he's not talking about a church
[1:41:17] building is talking about
[1:41:20] people in this world today
[1:41:23] is a group of people that have no
[1:41:27] sport that have no
[1:41:29] wrinkle they washed in the blood they
[1:41:33] perfect they don't have any problem they
[1:41:36] are holy they are
[1:41:39] blameless whether they feel it or not
[1:41:43] whether
[1:41:44] they they are excited about it you know
[1:41:48] someone many times people want to feel
[1:41:51] excited I feel
[1:41:54] you may not feel holy you may not even
[1:41:56] see the Holiness but if you said it then
[1:42:00] believe in my
[1:42:04] brother it is according to the good
[1:42:10] pleasure of
[1:42:13] his to the praise of the glory of his
[1:42:18] grace wherein he oh
[1:42:22] my let me go back bit to the praise of
[1:42:25] the glory of his
[1:42:28] grace the glory of
[1:42:30] what Grace you know what Grace is Grace
[1:42:35] means it is on his
[1:42:39] Merit not on
[1:42:43] your am I preaching to
[1:42:46] Believers he merited
[1:42:49] it Grace means un
[1:42:57] favor something you did not work hard to
[1:43:01] achieve but something which has been
[1:43:04] simply given to
[1:43:06] you because of
[1:43:08] choice because of love love and grace go
[1:43:13] together it's it's not about how many
[1:43:16] sins you committed in your
[1:43:18] life for how many you did not do that's
[1:43:21] why the devil defeats us many times
[1:43:24] because we look so much at
[1:43:26] ourselves and then we see failures we
[1:43:30] see sin we even see our thoughts
[1:43:33] B we see sincerely it is not possible
[1:43:36] for me to overcome as long as the devil
[1:43:39] has got you there you will always be
[1:43:42] defeated but you should quit looking at
[1:43:45] yourself because they sa
[1:43:47] here he it is
[1:43:50] afterward he says to the pray of the
[1:43:53] glory of his
[1:43:55] grace and I told you Grace is unmerited
[1:44:01] favor something you do not
[1:44:04] deserve you are being
[1:44:07] favored because you are Been
[1:44:10] Loved When a Man Loves a
[1:44:13] girl he chooses
[1:44:17] her meaning he has had Grace
[1:44:20] upon you you may come and say she's
[1:44:25] ugly she's short she's she's dark she's
[1:44:29] very
[1:44:30] red she has a big nose she has a big
[1:44:35] mouth but you see the more you speak
[1:44:38] those
[1:44:39] things the more you will irritate the
[1:44:41] the one who made the
[1:44:43] [Music]
[1:44:45] choice when someone makes a
[1:44:48] choice you who have not made that choice
[1:44:53] should be careful to say
[1:44:56] anything because you think you are
[1:44:59] advising but you are they actually
[1:45:01] beginning to dislike
[1:45:05] you how can you make such a
[1:45:07] choice can you see this this sister her
[1:45:10] eyes look bad even look at her teeth one
[1:45:14] teeth is out and the more you speak
[1:45:18] You're frustrating this person he may be
[1:45:21] quiet but if you are not careful the
[1:45:24] next thing you hear is a
[1:45:28] big you're not the one who chooses for
[1:45:31] me he he he has made his
[1:45:33] choice Out of
[1:45:37] Love Love Lies you know in the eyes of
[1:45:40] the
[1:45:43] beholder and he
[1:45:45] chooses according to how he feels and
[1:45:48] sees
[1:45:51] fit whether you agree with them
[1:45:55] it's a matter it's a personal
[1:45:57] matter it's a personal
[1:46:00] Affair it doesn't want your
[1:46:02] opinion that's why when it comes to
[1:46:04] choosing a wife you have to make your
[1:46:06] own
[1:46:08] choice no one makes a choice for you it
[1:46:11] is a type shows that what God has
[1:46:15] done an imited
[1:46:18] favor love covers a multitude of sin
[1:46:23] whether they will tell you this one they
[1:46:25] family they night
[1:46:26] dancers if truly you love her you don't
[1:46:30] care you said don't you worry I will
[1:46:33] deliver her by my prayer they tell you
[1:46:37] this one their family they
[1:46:40] divorce don't you worry mine is
[1:46:43] different it's a choice love covers a
[1:46:47] multitude of
[1:46:49] sins if they tell you those things and
[1:46:52] you change your mind
[1:46:54] it means you don't love that
[1:46:56] person but if you love that person
[1:46:59] regardless of what the words you hear
[1:47:02] regardless of what someone tells you
[1:47:04] your heart is already
[1:47:06] smitten and you have already favored
[1:47:08] that person and you will not change your
[1:47:11] mind many times people change their
[1:47:14] mind but God is God God is not a man God
[1:47:19] is not a man his first thought
[1:47:23] a perfect thought his perfect thought
[1:47:27] never be changed so now he in his mind
[1:47:33] before the foundation of the world he
[1:47:35] chose me he saw me as
[1:47:39] perfect
[1:47:46] blameless he saw my
[1:47:49] end the beginning
[1:47:54] the way I see you you are blameless You
[1:47:57] Are Holy you are perfect chosen you to
[1:48:02] be my bride and here I am today I know
[1:48:06] who I am I am a son
[1:48:11] of nothing nothing present nothing to
[1:48:17] come that
[1:48:21] fact that's not a
[1:48:24] presumption that is a
[1:48:28] fact to the praise of the glory of his
[1:48:33] grace
[1:48:34] wherein he has made
[1:48:45] us the Lord Jesus
[1:48:48] Christ and he has made me accepted in
[1:48:51] Christ
[1:48:56] sinc when you read the
[1:48:58] scripture with Revelation you cannot be
[1:49:01] that
[1:49:04] Sil as I was reading it I had all sorts
[1:49:08] of mixed
[1:49:09] feelings I was so happy to see that he
[1:49:13] has made me
[1:49:16] accept I am accepted in the
[1:49:20] Bel in whom in
[1:49:24] who in Christ in whom we have
[1:49:30] Redemption through his
[1:49:34] blood Redemption Redemption is not
[1:49:40] forgiveness you get a point forgiveness
[1:49:42] you have done
[1:49:45] something and you
[1:49:47] forgiven but
[1:49:49] Redemption you've not done anything
[1:49:52] you are what you were in his mind before
[1:49:54] you did
[1:49:58] anything so when the devil says they did
[1:50:02] ABC God says I don't see
[1:50:05] it I don't see it why because something
[1:50:10] happened God himself came down and he
[1:50:14] put on flesh and he died the death we
[1:50:18] were supposed to die
[1:50:20] [Music]
[1:50:23] we were supposed
[1:50:24] to in other words he took our
[1:50:29] place he was B because of so everything
[1:50:33] he went through was because of you and
[1:50:36] me so I don't have to go through
[1:50:39] it I am not
[1:50:41] guilty the Bible says he became sin that
[1:50:46] I might become the
[1:50:48] right oh God
[1:50:52] I am the righteousness of God can you
[1:50:57] imagine that you are the
[1:51:01] righteousness he became you so that we
[1:51:05] might become
[1:51:07] him and that's why he has said
[1:51:10] here he has made us
[1:51:13] accepted in whom we have forgiveness
[1:51:19] forgiveness we have what
[1:51:24] Redemption we have
[1:51:27] Redemption what were we in the
[1:51:29] beginning we were perfect we were
[1:51:32] sinless we were blameless without SP
[1:51:37] without wrinkle after his death on the
[1:51:40] cross where are we now we are blameless
[1:51:43] without sin we are
[1:51:46] perfect SP
[1:51:48] R we are redeemed we are taken back
[1:51:53] our original
[1:51:56] estate we are taken back in the only
[1:52:00] original where we were
[1:52:03] in what about
[1:52:07] ours can we be realistic a
[1:52:10] bit we indeed
[1:52:13] had but what happened to them there is
[1:52:17] something called The Sea of forget
[1:52:25] all our
[1:52:26] sins the moment we
[1:52:29] confess it doesn't matter how big they
[1:52:32] are it doesn't matter how huge
[1:52:36] they
[1:52:37] our carried away and they thrown into
[1:52:42] the sea of
[1:52:43] forgetfulness can God do can God
[1:52:47] forget yes that's the only thing God can
[1:52:50] do
[1:52:52] will always
[1:52:53] forget he forgot about my
[1:52:56] sins he forgot about what I did he
[1:53:00] forgot about my bad side he doesn't know
[1:53:03] about my bad side oh he only knows your
[1:53:06] good
[1:53:07] side when he sees you he calls you
[1:53:11] blameless he doesn't call you forgiven
[1:53:14] he calls you
[1:53:16] redeemed the only reason is he doesn't
[1:53:19] remember you were even forgiven
[1:53:48] for Hallelujah

[2:08:13] yourself if you say you try there is
[2:08:16] nothing you can do that can save you
[2:08:20] that is why God sent
[2:08:22] the last age to bring a message a
[2:08:26] message which bring us back into the
[2:08:29] world that Jesus is our
[2:08:33] savior someone said when I was sick at
[2:08:36] that
[2:08:36] [Music]
[2:08:37] time when I got over
[2:08:40] it
[2:08:42] said did you keep your religion during
[2:08:45] your
[2:08:52] I say no sir ITT
[2:08:58] me that is the
[2:09:01] difference and that's what
[2:09:04] happened amen the religion we have is
[2:09:08] Christ the hope of
[2:09:10] glory when we are SE it will hold us
[2:09:15] when we in Temptation will keep many
[2:09:19] times you try to fall away
[2:09:22] why are you here because he h
[2:09:26] you he spped
[2:09:28] away but why are you here he holding on
[2:09:32] you even if you try to fall away I dare
[2:09:37] you you cannot you cannot you
[2:09:40] canot why because he's holding on you he
[2:09:44] is holding on
[2:09:46] us
[2:09:48] amen hallelujah yes sir Hallelujah
[2:09:51] Hallelujah someone says let me go
[2:09:54] and you
[2:09:56] cannot fall
[2:09:59] away a SE cannot fall
[2:10:04] away yes he can
[2:10:07] fall but he cannot fall
[2:10:09] away why because when he fall you arise
[2:10:13] again that's why in
[2:10:15] M he said when I fall I
[2:10:19] arise don't don't
[2:10:22] sin and say it's okay for us we were
[2:10:26] defeated just accepting
[2:10:29] it when you fall when you
[2:10:33] fter don't be
[2:10:39] relaxed rise up
[2:10:42] again the strength of a
[2:10:44] Believer is not in the inability to fall
[2:10:53] all of you who are looking
[2:10:54] at you have
[2:10:56] fallen many times
[2:10:59] over so don't behave as if you have you
[2:11:02] have never done
[2:11:04] anything you have fallen and fallen
[2:11:07] and but why do you keep
[2:11:10] coming what is seeking
[2:11:12] after why because the heart of a child
[2:11:16] of
[2:11:17] God you cannot fall away
[2:11:21] when you fall you
[2:11:23] arise the power of a
[2:11:26] Believer is in the
[2:11:28] ability to fall and
[2:11:32] Rise a sinner cannot rise
[2:11:39] again but we are not
[2:11:41] Sinners we are the redeemed of the
[2:11:46] Lord that is
[2:11:49] why you know when people Peter
[2:11:52] fell he quickly
[2:11:54] repented and Rose up again but when
[2:11:58] Judas did the same
[2:12:00] thing he could not forgive
[2:12:03] himself he HED
[2:12:07] himself
[2:12:10] why his name was trapped off of
[2:12:16] the he became a
[2:12:19] himself he could forgive himself but
[2:12:23] brother I don't have to forgive
[2:12:25] myself Christ forgave me
[2:12:28] already and he told me you are not just
[2:12:32] forgiven you are
[2:12:34] [Music]
[2:12:36] redeemed remember when he told me you
[2:12:40] and
[2:12:41] [Music]

[2:12:45] one
[2:12:46] episode you had others now I'm preaching
[2:12:49] to my interpreter
[2:12:51] the name of the Lord but it doesn't
[2:12:53] matter how many times you

[2:14:24] there is a power in knowing who you
[2:14:29] are in the Book of Matthew 3:1
[2:14:35] 17 I say he says unw a voice from Heaven
[2:14:39] saying this is my beloved
[2:14:44] Son in whom I am well
[2:14:46] pleased and John 316 says for God so
[2:14:49] love the world
[2:14:51] that he gave his only begotten
[2:14:53] son that soever believeth in
[2:14:56] him should not perish but everting life
[2:15:00] so he says this is my beloved
[2:15:03] Son so when I say I'm accepted in the
[2:15:07] Beloved I mean I'm accepted in
[2:15:10] Christ in joh in John 317 says for God
[2:15:15] said not his
[2:15:16] son into the world to condemn the
[2:15:19] world Jesus is the only one who never
[2:15:22] came to condemn the
[2:15:26] world but that the world through
[2:15:29] him might be
[2:15:31] saved he that believeth on him is not
[2:15:36] condemned but he that believeth
[2:15:39] not is condemned
[2:15:42] already because he has not believed in
[2:15:45] the
[2:15:47] name he has not believed in the name
[2:15:51] have you believed in the
[2:15:53] name baptized in the
[2:15:55] name While others are saying I baptize
[2:15:58] you in the name of
[2:15:59] [Music]
[2:16:02] Father for you you believed on in the
[2:16:06] name and you were baptized in much
[2:16:09] water in the name above all
[2:16:12] name the name of the Lord
[2:16:17] Jesus oh my so we are accepted
[2:16:22] we are not just
[2:16:23] [Music]
[2:16:27] tolerated we are fully
[2:16:31] embraced and
[2:16:37] Val you know we have a saying that says
[2:16:40] accept me the way I
[2:16:43] am but usually people try to compete to
[2:16:46] be
[2:16:49] accepted that's why women use
[2:16:52] makeup they're trying to be
[2:16:56] accepted so even when she's
[2:16:59] ugly she will have to apply as
[2:17:03] much to make herself
[2:17:06] ACC that's why true genuine Believers of
[2:17:09] the
[2:17:11] word sisters they do not
[2:17:15] use why they know who they
[2:17:18] are they know they a fearfully and
[2:17:23] wonderfully they
[2:17:25] know and they know men who want to marry
[2:17:28] them are not looking for outside Beauty
[2:17:30] as
[2:17:32] such they are looking for God's
[2:17:35] character in
[2:17:37] them that's why our
[2:17:39] sisters do not use makeup because they
[2:17:43] already
[2:17:47] beautiful what has made them beautiful
[2:17:50] beauty of
[2:17:55] Christ so they are not trying to
[2:17:59] compete
[2:18:06] AC so they see my
[2:18:11] lips that is not what you're
[2:18:14] following because you know you already
[2:18:16] accepted many women were coming to see
[2:18:18] the
[2:18:19] king and one of
[2:18:22] them you
[2:18:24] know she refused to accept anything
[2:18:28] extra others were asking for
[2:18:31] more but when it came down for Esther
[2:18:34] she said I don't want anything
[2:18:36] else only want to see the
[2:18:39] king sister before you get
[2:18:42] married you don't need to be accepted by
[2:18:45] other girls or other
[2:18:48] boys you are seeking for approval
[2:18:51] don't seek for approval of
[2:18:53] men seek for approval of
[2:18:56] God when God approves of
[2:18:59] you he will bring you his
[2:19:03] son he himself will bring his son to
[2:19:06] you you w
[2:19:09] compete there are sisters who compete
[2:19:11] for
[2:19:16] men
[2:19:17] brother do you know when are you getting
[2:19:20] getting
[2:19:23] married she's
[2:19:26] competing the way I see this brother he
[2:19:29] has been eying the other
[2:19:31] sister but the way I see him he should
[2:19:34] be mine so let me compete the way I see
[2:19:37] you brother are you really even planning
[2:19:40] about it is not your
[2:19:42] [Music]
[2:19:43] sister to ask a man's hand in
[2:19:47] marriage Pastor I didn't ask for his
[2:19:49] hand in marriage
[2:19:51] I simply asked him when he's
[2:19:54] marryed so
[2:19:56] what it is not your place my
[2:19:59] sister your place is to be approved by
[2:20:03] God be accepted by God then he will
[2:20:07] bring you his
[2:20:09] son he will bring you his son when he
[2:20:13] has
[2:20:16] accepted sh amen
[2:20:21] we don't believe in sisters
[2:20:31] proposing those ones are in
[2:20:35] religions you are
[2:20:37] singles that is true we don't do
[2:20:42] that Believers we have a way we handle
[2:20:44] our
[2:20:47] issues come and ask the pastor and the
[2:20:50] deacon amen so our sisters are already
[2:20:54] accepted by
[2:20:55] God when you are accepted by God then he
[2:20:59] will get you a very good
[2:21:02] son someone who will not give you
[2:21:08] hustle hallelujah

[2:21:34] okay I'll see whether they will

[2:21:40] see if you don't change he pushes your
[2:21:43] away if you
[2:21:44] change no
[2:21:47] accepted means we are not d
[2:21:52] we are fully
[2:21:56] embraced and we are valued by
[2:22:01] God and there is nothing that you have
[2:22:04] done to earn
[2:22:10] that it is fully
[2:22:13] based on Christ's Merit

[2:26:06] understand
[2:26:08] what it can't even grasp the life we
[2:26:14] have it will try to imitate
[2:26:17] to
[2:26:19] but but for that seed it is a it is
[2:26:23] laws I don't want to come back to your
[2:26:25] church because you have a lot of laws
[2:26:28] you be like where are the where are the
[2:26:31] RO for us is our
[2:26:34] life it's like telling is like like
[2:26:37] telling a
[2:26:38] God I don't want to come back to your
[2:26:42] pen because for you you don't mingle in
[2:26:47] mud you have a lot of rules
[2:26:52] but for
[2:26:53] us it's
[2:26:55] okay
[2:26:57] nothing we can go in
[2:27:00] Mad have a good time but you are telling
[2:27:03] a
[2:27:04] sheep sheep does not understand that
[2:27:08] language be asking what are you talking
[2:27:10] about you mean mingling in mud is having
[2:27:13] a good
[2:27:15] time and the little piggy would say

[2:27:33] pen I am here because I have access I am
[2:27:38] here because I've come here through the
[2:27:41] access of Grace by
[2:27:43] [Music]
[2:27:47] faith I don't go to this school
[2:27:51] it is not
[2:27:52] just I don't have the appetite I don't
[2:27:56] drink
[2:27:57] Al that because I am
[2:28:00] resenting I don't have the appetite for
[2:28:03] alcohol I no longer take
[2:28:05] women because I'm not a
[2:28:08] man but it is because I
[2:28:10] changed when the Holy Spirit came in me
[2:28:14] he did a work in
[2:28:16] me and he brought me to be accepted into
[2:28:20] Christ and to me it is not a law and to
[2:28:24] me it is a new
[2:28:26] life
[2:28:29] Hallelujah Galatians
[2:28:31] 3:21 is the law then against the
[2:28:34] promises of
[2:28:37] God God forbid for if there had been a
[2:28:40] law given which could have given
[2:28:44] life very righteousness should have been
[2:28:46] by the
[2:28:48] Lord but the scripture has concluded all
[2:28:55] sin that the
[2:28:57] Promise by faith of Jesus
[2:29:00] Christ might be given to them them not
[2:29:04] everybody
[2:29:06] them that
[2:29:09] believe before you talk to that
[2:29:12] person is he believing or is
[2:29:18] not the promise
[2:29:21] is to them that
[2:29:22] believe and in Hebrews chapter

[2:30:45] things but I'm still

[2:32:27] marriage I am
[2:32:30] standing I'm standing on
[2:32:33] his and he has perfected
[2:32:37] us through his suffering and his
[2:32:42] blood praise the Lord now in the sadan
[2:32:46] church
[2:32:47] age uh brother B say a few
[2:32:50] comments to try and speak about the
[2:32:55] book and he speaks about different names
[2:32:57] in the
[2:32:58] book and I want to just s a little
[2:33:01] portion of
[2:33:02] it put this whole thing into
[2:33:05] perspective th if God has so designed
[2:33:08] that there be those whose names are
[2:33:10] placed in a seel in a a section of the
[2:33:13] Lamb Book of Life
[2:33:23] and cannot those names cannot be
[2:33:27] erased for they are the names of
[2:33:31] his then we must accept
[2:33:34] that there is a
[2:33:37] section in in the book of
[2:33:39] life amen I believe the
[2:33:43] the the chapter of that
[2:33:48] section is titled
[2:33:52] the Lamb's Book of
[2:33:54] Life in there are
[2:33:57] names of
[2:33:59] those that are supposed to be his
[2:34:02] bride and those names can never
[2:34:09] be by the way this enti message is all
[2:34:11] about seeking for the
[2:34:17] bright that's why I'm preaching
[2:34:19] something like like
[2:34:20] this it is impossible to fall
[2:34:27] away it is impossible to be
[2:34:30] lost it is impossible to be
[2:34:35] deceived if it be possible they shall
[2:34:37] deceive the
[2:34:42] very the elect cannot be dece
[2:34:50] you mean Pastor should walk
[2:34:52] bragging yes
[2:34:57] walking in me I brag of
[2:35:01] nothing except in Christ amen I
[2:35:06] Christ so I can walk as a child of God
[2:35:10] and I I'm a child of a
[2:35:13] king I will never fall I never
[2:35:17] see to hell yes
[2:35:21] sir the devil cannot understand that I'm
[2:35:25] going to heaven I'm the
[2:35:28] rapure I know what I
[2:35:30] am that is
[2:35:32] not that is not Pride it is busting in
[2:35:38] Christ it is busting in
[2:35:41] Christ oh Hallelujah hallelu Believers
[2:35:45] we should learn to
[2:35:50] yes sir so if it also states that there
[2:35:52] are those whose names were placed in the
[2:35:54] record of the book of
[2:35:58] life but in the for knowledge of
[2:36:02] God those were to
[2:36:05] fall and have their names
[2:36:07] removed we must also accept
[2:36:14] them it was not in the other
[2:36:17] section it was just in the general book
[2:36:21] but their names were removed because
[2:36:25] they
[2:36:28] fell one of
[2:36:31] them is brother
[2:36:33] Judas he
[2:36:35] fell
[2:36:38] but can
[2:36:41] fall amen you remember when Jesus told
[2:36:45] them Rejoice because your names are on
[2:36:47] the book
[2:36:50] Judah was among
[2:36:51] them but he fell and his name
[2:36:56] was but God knew that
[2:36:59] also and if there are those whose names
[2:37:02] were never placed upon a record of life
[2:37:04] we must also accept
[2:37:05] [Music]
[2:37:11] them by the way there are also
[2:37:14] some whose names are not there
[2:37:19] which means this is
[2:37:22] scary but listen which means they can
[2:37:27] never
[2:37:30] be I'm going to give you an example
[2:37:32] today from the Bible no matter what you
[2:37:36] do they cannot be their names are not on
[2:37:40] the record of
[2:37:43] [Music]
[2:37:45] life you find them
[2:37:47] nowhere they don't even come out at the
[2:37:51] their names are
[2:37:53] not they of another
[2:37:57] seed we are going to say
[2:38:00] them they cannot be
[2:38:02] accepted no matter what you do no matter
[2:38:05] what they
[2:38:08] do these things when you know them
[2:38:12] brings you to a
[2:38:13] place say God I can't understand
[2:38:16] everything and why everything is that
[2:38:19] but all I understand is that you love me
[2:38:23] and that's enough for
[2:38:24] me and if there are those who will enter
[2:38:27] into life eternal after the white thr
[2:38:34] judgment Solly on the grounds of being
[2:38:37] good and
[2:38:42] kind and just to the elect of
[2:38:46] God who are his brethren
[2:38:49] then we have to accept that so there are
[2:38:53] some I don't know where where their
[2:38:55] names
[2:38:58] are we don't know we don't know all we
[2:39:02] know is that they receive eternal
[2:39:06] life simply because they good to the
[2:39:12] Brethren when we are you naked and we
[2:39:15] fed you when we are in the hospital and
[2:39:18] we visit for as much as you did unto
[2:39:20] these
[2:39:21] little you did it unto me so there's
[2:39:24] that
[2:39:26] category we don't know where thees
[2:39:28] are all I know they receive
[2:39:32] life now you will know why God said to K
[2:39:35] we going to read it if you will do
[2:39:42] good who knoweth the mind of the Lord
[2:39:45] that he should instruct him
[2:39:50] rather let us be
[2:39:52] subject in faith to
[2:39:55] him who is our
[2:39:58] father and we should
[2:40:00] leave you can now turn to Genesis
[2:40:04] 4 I to show you what God spoke to
[2:40:08] Cain this is a brother we call him a
[2:40:11] brother but actually his name was not
[2:40:13] the
[2:40:18] book he just uh it's just mindboggling
[2:40:21] if you
[2:40:24] want Genesis
[2:40:27] 4:3 from 3 to 7 and in the process of
[2:40:31] time it came to pass that Cain brought
[2:40:34] of the fruit of the ground an offering
[2:40:36] unto the Lord and Abel also brought of
[2:40:39] the fast fatlings of his flock and of
[2:40:42] the fat there over the Lord had respect
[2:40:45] unto Abel unto his offering but unto
[2:40:47] Cain unto his offering he had not
[2:40:48] respect
[2:40:49] and Cain was very wroth and his
[2:40:51] countenance fell and the Lord said unto
[2:40:53] Cain why art thou wroth and why is thy
[2:40:55] gness Fallen if thou doest well shalt
[2:40:57] thou not be accepted but if thou doest
[2:41:00] not well sin life at the door and unto
[2:41:02] thee shall be his desire and thou sh
[2:41:04] rule over him
[2:41:07] [Music]
[2:41:20] hallelujah hallelujah did you read read
[2:41:23] from vers 3 to vers 7 of Genesis chapter
[2:41:25] 4
[2:41:58] [Music]
[2:42:09] friends I want you to follow me
[2:42:10] here we are now going the CLX of
[2:42:15] this um we see there are two seeds here
[2:42:20] Twi
[2:42:22] twins but you see later on we also see
[2:42:24] other
[2:42:26] twins
[2:42:28] Bible es and Jacob now the Bible says
[2:42:32] God hated
[2:42:34] es and he loved
[2:42:37] who when when did go do
[2:42:43] that what did what did es
[2:42:47] do that made God Hur him
[2:42:55] what did what did AB do I
[2:42:59] mean jaob was as B because remember when
[2:43:02] he they were both born they were even
[2:43:05] fighting when they were in the
[2:43:08] womb and when he was born you know he
[2:43:11] was a
[2:43:13] supplanter he was not a good guy he was
[2:43:16] a cheat I'm talking about
[2:43:20] Jacob you know we can go in the story
[2:43:22] but you see what made God love
[2:43:26] Jacob
[2:43:30] and what the same thing that made him do
[2:43:34] that is the same thing that made him
[2:43:37] love
[2:43:39] you not because you were
[2:43:42] perfect he he loved you actually before
[2:43:45] you even manifested good or bad
[2:43:50] it's called
[2:43:56] predestination you were in his
[2:43:59] mind when you come to the world you have
[2:44:02] a desire you have a
[2:44:05] longing the body is doing things as
[2:44:08] everybody you are you are longing for
[2:44:12] something yet others had not long for
[2:44:16] their longing was the
[2:44:18] B you wanted to be filled with the Holy
[2:44:21] Ghost you wanted to be changed you are
[2:44:24] seeking for something no can give you
[2:44:27] others can exchange it for
[2:44:29] anything but you could not exchange it
[2:44:31] for
[2:44:32] anything all you wanted is a
[2:44:35] chain you felt you were something in
[2:44:38] your heart that you were not on the
[2:44:43] outside and you had a lot of fear but if
[2:44:47] you knew by the if you get what you
[2:44:51] desired would wash away all the
[2:44:55] fear I'm talking about jaob and that's
[2:44:58] why Jacob when he got that birth it was
[2:45:02] a best of of everything in his
[2:45:05] life he led him to the
[2:45:08] Angel and the angel came and they
[2:45:12] wrestled they wrestled they wrestled and
[2:45:16] he say leave me the day breaker
[2:45:19] he said as God
[2:45:21] leave I will not leave you I
[2:45:26] want
[2:45:28] something so what do you want I need a
[2:45:31] name
[2:45:32] change I need a blessing Bless Me Now oh
[2:45:36] I don't let go of
[2:45:38] you that's why we
[2:45:42] think that's why we think it is us who s
[2:45:47] God
[2:45:49] because we are seeing ourselves like
[2:45:50] jaob you know I prayed and I prayed and
[2:45:53] I prayed I held on to the man I told
[2:45:57] him until you bless me and then you
[2:46:00] blessed me if I had not prayed it is
[2:46:04] true but it is false because God loved
[2:46:08] Jacob before he
[2:46:12] prayed God loved Jacob before Jacob knew
[2:46:15] anything about life
[2:46:19] and everything was leading to that
[2:46:23] moment God allowed things to go the way
[2:46:25] they have been going in your
[2:46:29] life even sin has been in your
[2:46:32] life so that glory to God so that when
[2:46:35] the word comes it will have an effect on
[2:46:39] you that you will be
[2:46:42] convicted say oh
[2:46:44] God bless me now change me now
[2:46:49] it wasn't you
[2:46:50] seeking the whole thing was God seeking
[2:46:55] you and then eventually his name was
[2:46:58] changed he said your name has been
[2:47:01] changed from a
[2:47:05] jaob to
[2:47:06] Israel Prince with God you are
[2:47:10] royalty when did he become
[2:47:13] royalty from before the foundation of
[2:47:15] the
[2:47:16] world from before he was born
[2:47:20] he was royalty the Bible says that we
[2:47:22] are also Kings and
[2:47:25] priest so
[2:47:28] weyty don't with me I am
[2:47:33] a must not pray with you you are a PRI
[2:47:38] you are a
[2:47:39] priest
[2:47:41] amen when the world say you think you're
[2:47:44] something what do you mean of course I'm
[2:47:47] I'm something good of course yeah I just
[2:47:51] don't think I know
[2:47:55] it because I am a prince I am a princess
[2:47:59] and that's why we see
[2:48:01] Kan same thing Kan was born by Eve and
[2:48:06] ab was born by
[2:48:08] Eve out of the same womb they were
[2:48:11] twins but they were two different
[2:48:13] seats we see that both of them gave
[2:48:17] offerings God rejected offering of of
[2:48:20] Cain and they accepted the offering
[2:48:23] of and Cain was
[2:48:25] angry he was so sad and
[2:48:29] angry you know the spirit of competition
[2:48:31] is usually the spirit of
[2:48:35] can children of God don't always mind
[2:48:39] about what others
[2:48:44] have what others have
[2:48:46] got because they know
[2:48:49] they are the blessing of
[2:48:53] God whatever God purpose for you to
[2:48:56] achieve in
[2:48:58] life no one can steal it away from you
[2:49:01] if a brother buys a
[2:49:03] car you have no reason to be
[2:49:08] angry you just be
[2:49:10] happy but some people
[2:49:19] on the
[2:49:23] outside they go behind the car when
[2:49:26] dedicating the
[2:49:30] car we are saying let us dedicate the
[2:49:32] car of the
[2:49:33] brother you're very busy also
[2:49:36] now what
[2:49:38] about
[2:49:40] competition don't about yourself what is
[2:49:43] yours is yours no one can ever take away
[2:49:46] what is belongs to you
[2:49:49] your blessing is
[2:49:54] coming be careful about the things that
[2:49:57] I said on the
[2:49:59] pulpit because they
[2:50:01] happen so if the word was your blessing
[2:50:04] is coming and you believe it it will
[2:50:10] come and
[2:50:12] and was was happy but Cain was
[2:50:17] not God asked him a
[2:50:20] question God came that
[2:50:22] day he was the preacher of the
[2:50:27] day the church was
[2:50:30] full
[2:50:33] Eve and other sisters we don't
[2:50:36] know church was
[2:50:39] full songs were
[2:50:42] s offerings were
[2:50:44] given after
[2:50:47] offering God come
[2:50:51] he doesn't need to read a Bible because
[2:50:52] he the
[2:50:55] book and then when he looks through the
[2:50:58] church he Sayes brother Kan very angry
[2:51:01] in the
[2:51:06] corner and he brother very happy
[2:51:13] and he says church today my sermon is
[2:51:20] if thou doest
[2:51:22] well shall not thee be
[2:51:27] accepted and you know those preachers
[2:51:29] who call names of
[2:51:32] people sometimes the pastor can call you
[2:51:34] exactly when he's talking about the
[2:51:36] thing that belongs to
[2:51:40] you you think did someone tell no it is
[2:51:44] always
[2:51:46] discernment when a pastor a preacher is
[2:51:49] preaching he
[2:51:51] prophesying he doesn't know but he's
[2:51:54] prophesying you you
[2:51:57] know and so he begins he says for
[2:52:01] example brother
[2:52:04] Kan my
[2:52:06] son only do
[2:52:08] well if you do well like your
[2:52:13] brother will you not be
[2:52:15] accepted will I not be accepted you is
[2:52:19] God a
[2:52:21] liar God is never a
[2:52:24] liar if he said it he meant
[2:52:27] it but did believe
[2:52:31] it no after the seron that
[2:52:35] day brother Kan was in the
[2:52:38] church saying
[2:52:41] amen am for sure I will do good his
[2:52:46] tears were not out of conviction
[2:52:50] was out of
[2:52:51] sadness that he was not
[2:52:54] accepted
[2:52:57] amen
[2:52:59] even no
[2:53:04] problem said the church is
[2:53:07] dismissed when they dismissed the
[2:53:11] service went to
[2:53:13] brother he said
[2:53:15] brother yes my brother bless
[2:53:24] you brother
[2:53:29] be
[2:53:31] they if you he somebody saying
[2:53:35] theyed not the word was
[2:53:38] roting stop saying they roed us said
[2:53:42] they roed
[2:53:43] me because God knows you
[2:53:49] you know now my brother I have an
[2:53:52] idea since God accepted
[2:53:55] you and he also the word came to me said
[2:53:58] that if I also do what
[2:54:00] I take me to the
[2:54:03] field let me see how you do your
[2:54:07] business so that I can also
[2:54:10] Lear you know me I'm a
[2:54:13] farmer and you know me I believe that
[2:54:16] even you know this is problem with
[2:54:20] and I want you to see it and then I'll
[2:54:22] finish CU I'm going to
[2:54:25] read so listen carefully so he said
[2:54:29] farmer
[2:54:31] you so God loves what you are
[2:54:35] doing so teach me there no problem not
[2:54:39] everyone that says teach me wants to
[2:54:43] learn always design the spirit
[2:54:49] brother Abel accepts him they go in the
[2:54:52] field and then while he was showing him
[2:54:55] now you see now when you take
[2:54:58] this what are you talking about in
[2:55:09] his does it mean it has to be
[2:55:12] sheep in Anger he
[2:55:17] gets where the other brother was
[2:55:20] showing you know the brother was
[2:55:22] happy just you know naive not knowing
[2:55:26] that this
[2:55:27] brother is a different
[2:55:30] seity they are not children of the same
[2:55:34] father got the
[2:55:36] stone said you
[2:55:38] see show
[2:55:44] me brother what have you done
[2:55:52] let me ask a
[2:55:53] question do we see people killing this
[2:55:55] people the same
[2:56:00] today the spirit of is not
[2:56:06] there I'll leave that there and then
[2:56:10] after
[2:56:11] that God comes
[2:56:14] down what have you
[2:56:16] done nothing
[2:56:22] Hallelujah but God has seen
[2:56:25] everything but I want to us talk about
[2:56:28] this what was the
[2:56:30] problem why did God not accept K's
[2:56:34] offering why did he accept
[2:56:36] AB I will restore unto you say the Lord
[2:56:39] in that
[2:56:41] message now in these two in there there
[2:56:44] are these two
[2:56:44] [Music]
[2:56:46] boys one of them Kan and another
[2:56:49] both of them were
[2:56:52] Believers that yes sir both of them
[2:56:56] believed in
[2:56:57] God and if Faith had had sorry and if
[2:57:01] faith and belief in God is all God
[2:57:09] requires then if God condemned Cain and
[2:57:12] accepted Abel and both of them believe
[2:57:14] as God is unjust
[2:57:21] that's right because both of them was
[2:57:24] Believers you hear some people said
[2:57:26] today the only thing you have to do is
[2:57:28] to
[2:57:29] believe just believe we B become a
[2:57:33] member of the church that's enough no it
[2:57:36] is not
[2:57:39] enough that's just to
[2:57:42] begin someone said brother what about
[2:57:45] Abraham
[2:57:48] Abraham believed God and it was imputed
[2:57:51] unto him
[2:57:52] right that's true Abraham believed but
[2:57:56] God gave him the Seal of
[2:58:00] circumcision as a testimony that he had
[2:58:02] confirmed his
[2:58:05] faith and today a man can believe unto
[2:58:07] God for eternal
[2:58:10] life and he gives him the Holy
[2:58:13] Ghost as a
[2:58:15] circumcision as a confirmation of his
[2:58:17] Fai
[2:58:19] so in other words after believing you
[2:58:22] have to be filled with the
[2:58:26] Holy
[2:58:27] amen okay now notice in
[2:58:30] Genesis then I could see both boys
[2:58:33] wanted to find favor with
[2:58:36] God now Kan is not a
[2:58:39] communist neither is he an
[2:58:42] unbeliever he's a Believer and a
[2:58:45] worshiper now there is not a starting
[2:58:47] now
[2:58:49] I'm going to use these two microphones
[2:58:50] here this afternoon as two trees both
[2:58:53] boys you say this is Abel and
[2:58:59] that's both boys come up to
[2:59:02] God the east side of the garden I
[2:59:06] suppose and as these two boys come up
[2:59:10] they both come up to worship
[2:59:12] God both of them is that right Bible
[2:59:16] scholars both boys come to
[2:59:19] worship and both of them built an
[2:59:22] altar that would be a
[2:59:25] church both of them had
[2:59:28] churches so watch out has a church
[2:59:34] today and
[2:59:35] so the church you belong
[2:59:38] to is it that of
[2:59:42] or if God is
[2:59:45] satisfied and all it takes to belong if
[2:59:48] you belong to church and be a believer
[2:59:50] and belong to church you think that
[2:59:51] that's what god isied
[2:59:56] with watch just a
[2:59:58] minute not only that but both boys offer
[3:00:02] a
[3:00:03] sacrifice then if being a
[3:00:06] Believer a
[3:00:08] Confessor and a church
[3:00:10] member making a
[3:00:12] sacrifice if that is all of the
[3:00:14] experience you
[3:00:16] got you haven't got anywhere
[3:00:20] yet now you may be very
[3:00:24] fundamental but that don't mean
[3:00:27] anything now Kan belonged to
[3:00:31] church he confessed he believed on God
[3:00:35] he wasn't a
[3:00:37] hypocrite let us pause there Kan was not
[3:00:41] a
[3:00:44] hypocrite can you imagine that brother
[3:00:46] he
[3:00:51] I wonder whether everyone here is
[3:00:55] sincere but Kan was
[3:00:58] sincere so if you're not sincere you
[3:01:01] don't even qualify to be a
[3:01:09] Kan that is a hard saying isn't
[3:01:13] it all right let's continue here he
[3:01:17] wasn't a HP
[3:01:19] he believed God he worshiped God and he
[3:01:23] belonged to
[3:01:25] church an
[3:01:27] altar he brought a sacrifice and offered
[3:01:31] it and knelt down and prayed and made
[3:01:36] his
[3:01:38] confession brother if that ain't a good
[3:01:41] church member of
[3:01:44] this I don't know where ones at
[3:01:47] but that was not
[3:01:49] it AB done the same
[3:01:52] thing why did God receive Abel and
[3:01:58] condemn how many want to know why
[3:02:01] because had recompense unto the real
[3:02:07] world because Abel had a spiritual
[3:02:13] Revelation a spiritual revelation of the
[3:02:16] will of God
[3:02:21] can you say
[3:02:22] Amen AB had spiritual
[3:02:26] Revelation spiritual
[3:02:28] Revelation everybody say spiritual
[3:02:33] Revelation that is what you need that's
[3:02:36] what cannot
[3:02:38] have spiritual
[3:02:40] [Music]
[3:02:43] Revelation Jesus said upon this Ro I
[3:02:47] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[3:02:51] shall not Prevail against what
[3:02:54] rock spiritual
[3:02:57] revelation of who Jesus Christ
[3:03:00] is if you have a
[3:03:03] revelation of who Jesus
[3:03:05] is then you must have a
[3:03:09] revelation of who you
[3:03:13] are and and Jesus yes built his church
[3:03:17] on
[3:03:21] so did not have
[3:03:24] Revelation remember they didn't have no
[3:03:26] book to read
[3:03:28] from they only had to have
[3:03:31] revelation of how to approach God and
[3:03:34] how to worship
[3:03:38] God how did Sin come into the world now
[3:03:42] don't miss this don't miss this how did
[3:03:46] Sin come into the world
[3:03:49] by mixing
[3:03:54] blood of the
[3:03:57] serpent with that of the human
[3:04:00] [Music]
[3:04:02] being and it brought forth a
[3:04:04] [Music]
[3:04:06] child and his name
[3:04:10] was
[3:04:13] brother did you know that was not the
[3:04:16] son of
[3:04:20] when you go into the genealogy of
[3:04:22] Adam you can't find kind there you find
[3:04:26] say as the first one because
[3:04:30] killed and the Bible
[3:04:33] says
[3:04:34] replaced
[3:04:36] amen now the geny of Adam it is like
[3:04:40] this God
[3:04:42] cream gave birth to se SE gave birth to
[3:04:46] is not
[3:04:48] but he also has his genology in the New
[3:04:52] Testament joh the Bible says
[3:04:57] that he was the son of the evil
[3:05:01] one who is the evil one it is
[3:05:08] Satan sin came through
[3:05:11] Bloodshed and sin cannot be dealt
[3:05:14] with without the shedding of blood
[3:05:19] you hear
[3:05:20] that
[3:05:23] now got the
[3:05:26] Revelation when he he shouted Hallelujah
[3:05:30] yes
[3:05:31] sir it was the blood which
[3:05:34] Jesus he went and slaughtered the L and
[3:05:37] he broke
[3:05:38] it
[3:05:40] broke blood gashed out and he burn
[3:05:45] it when it went before
[3:05:54] son the
[3:05:56] ration he has understood the
[3:05:59] Myster how sin came in the world he has
[3:06:02] got the
[3:06:03] Revelation how sin will leave the world
[3:06:06] he has killed the
[3:06:08] lamb because that
[3:06:11] ration he has known that in the
[3:06:14] future even me
[3:06:16] God I'm going to put on
[3:06:20] flesh die like a
[3:06:22] lamb AB has
[3:06:25] Revelation when
[3:06:27] he when he smelt of blood says surely
[3:06:30] that is my child but
[3:06:33] but was like the way I
[3:06:37] see my
[3:06:40] mother must have ate an
[3:06:44] apple it was an apple
[3:06:51] and he took all the
[3:06:53] apples and the PE if it wasn't Apple it
[3:06:57] must have
[3:06:59] been if it must have been
[3:07:03] watermelon orange or something one of
[3:07:05] the
[3:07:06] fruits he displayed all the fruits
[3:07:09] there he said God I've
[3:07:12] really now receive my offering it must
[3:07:15] have been Apple
[3:07:17] and he gave
[3:07:25] it what seed is
[3:07:28] that had no
[3:07:30] re because he was not a seed of
[3:07:34] God but God is
[3:07:37] SE has the revelation of the word amen
[3:07:42] hallelujah
[3:07:44] amen even today
[3:07:50] religions they still think that Eve ate
[3:07:53] an apple what is
[3:07:58] that they can't
[3:08:00] explain why the Bible says without Shing
[3:08:03] of
[3:08:04] blood there is no
[3:08:06] remission they don't know
[3:08:08] why they don't know why Jesus had to
[3:08:13] die they don't know why blood had to be
[3:08:16] shed
[3:08:18] they can't understand that it was
[3:08:20] because sin came into the World by
[3:08:22] shedding a mixing of
[3:08:27] blood thaten must go away by the
[3:08:30] shedding of blood of the
[3:08:34] innocent they don't understand
[3:08:37] that but the true
[3:08:40] seed understands it and that seed has
[3:08:43] been
[3:08:44] accepted in the Beloved
[3:08:49] that's why in Hebrews
[3:08:54] 11 by faith AB offered unto God a more
[3:08:57] excellent
[3:09:01] Sacrifice by
[3:09:04] what by
[3:09:06] what faith what is
[3:09:09] Faith
[3:09:13] Revelation by spiritual revelation
[3:09:17] my church don't don't sleep now don't
[3:09:19] sleep I'm finishing in a few
[3:09:22] minutes what is faith faith is a
[3:09:26] spiritual revelation of the will of
[3:09:33] God so
[3:09:39] Faith perfect and by faith offered unto
[3:09:42] God a more
[3:09:45] excellent you know and Abel didn't have
[3:09:48] a bible to
[3:09:49] read but it was revealed to Abel by
[3:09:53] Fai which is a
[3:09:56] revelation Abel offered unto God a more
[3:09:59] excellent
[3:10:01] sacrifice than that of K which God
[3:10:05] testified that he was righteous a
[3:10:08] Believer does everything that she does
[3:10:10] by
[3:10:15] revation reation
[3:10:18] they gave
[3:10:19] sacrifices but one didn't have
[3:10:24] Revelation brother if you ever give God
[3:10:27] a
[3:10:28] sacrifice give by
[3:10:31] Revelation don't give by that's why we
[3:10:35] don't believe in in pumping people to
[3:10:40] give pulling for
[3:10:44] money is see that remaining in the B it
[3:10:49] give it that you get a
[3:10:52] blessing I would have been a good pentec
[3:10:56] preacher I would have pulled the man out
[3:10:58] of
[3:10:59] you but I thank God that he saved
[3:11:05] me the man can speak and say this is God
[3:11:09] surely surely this is God God is seeing
[3:11:13] it give it give it give it the blessing
[3:11:16] is coming is coming I see is knocking on
[3:11:19] your
[3:11:21] door and you pull out
[3:11:24] everything the blessing is coming but
[3:11:27] you see that's not by
[3:11:31] Revelation give by
[3:11:33] Revelation and others when they hear
[3:11:38] that because I don't have Revelation
[3:11:42] yet if you don't have
[3:11:46] revelation are not a seed of
[3:11:50] God a seed of God must always have
[3:11:54] Revelation the church is built upon
[3:11:58] revelation God cannot if the need if
[3:12:01] there is a need of
[3:12:04] 500,000 and you have two
[3:12:06] million I can assure you of this God
[3:12:10] cannot reveal to you to give
[3:12:16] 1 is
[3:12:18] impossible at least he will tell you pay
[3:12:21] it
[3:12:24] all and you see such people they begin
[3:12:28] to
[3:12:29] prosper why they doing things by
[3:12:34] the not
[3:12:36] by
[3:12:38] pushing
[3:12:40] foring no it is by Revelation and they
[3:12:44] do it
[3:12:45] cheerfully joyfully
[3:12:48] not
[3:12:49] for if you do ever do anything by
[3:12:54] Revelation expect a blessing in
[3:12:59] return if you're serving in
[3:13:01] Ministry Serve by
[3:13:07] re we don't want you to just come here
[3:13:10] to because you're
[3:13:12] gifted no
[3:13:15] no there millions of gifted people in
[3:13:18] the
[3:13:19] world but if you you Minister whether
[3:13:23] you're a musician or a preacher whatever
[3:13:26] if you Minister for any other reason
[3:13:29] apart from
[3:13:34] revelation God is is smelling a stench
[3:13:38] St in his
[3:13:42] no he's not happy with your
[3:13:45] sacrifice he wants re
[3:13:48] in your ministry to the extent Paul said
[3:13:52] this why unto me if I preach not the
[3:13:56] gospel because Paul had a
[3:13:59] revelation he was given the
[3:14:02] [Music]
[3:14:03] responsibility when God gave him the
[3:14:06] gift and he gave him the calling it was
[3:14:09] not for
[3:14:11] him sometimes some of us preachers we
[3:14:16] feel like
[3:14:18] you know maybe first going in a holiday
[3:14:20] of one year or two
[3:14:24] years but you don't even remember when
[3:14:27] When the Thought comes and flashes and
[3:14:31] disappears why because you have a sense
[3:14:35] of responsibility on your
[3:14:37] [Music]
[3:14:39] shoulders even if the government said
[3:14:42] now no more
[3:14:44] preaching that's why the president of
[3:14:46] this country is very white
[3:14:50] he has protected the
[3:14:51] church and in that way God has also
[3:14:53] protected him on
[3:14:56] the if you want to see
[3:14:58] fire stop
[3:15:01] us and I'm meaning it you cannot stop
[3:15:05] the
[3:15:07] church because there are some people
[3:15:10] like us who are
[3:15:14] radical you have said no preaching
[3:15:17] okay let us die
[3:15:20] preaching have to be
[3:15:28] same and if you stop us that you don't
[3:15:31] even go on the streets we shall do it I
[3:15:34] remember when I was in China I would
[3:15:37] never forget that
[3:15:39] experience and I remember says a man
[3:15:41] under
[3:15:43] pressure is who he is under pressure
[3:15:48] when you under pressure that's when you
[3:15:50] discover who you
[3:15:51] are me I discovered who I was when I was
[3:15:55] in a situation in China when they arrest
[3:15:58] you preaching as a foreigner
[3:16:04] there
[3:16:05] so I'm in a about 20 something five
[3:16:10] floors
[3:16:12] up in a believer's
[3:16:14] home the word has called fire
[3:16:18] preaching and the brother is
[3:16:19] interpreting in Chinese and then we hear
[3:16:22] a
[3:16:23] knock in just a split of a
[3:16:26] second the people had already he the
[3:16:29] Bible I don't know how when I looked I
[3:16:32] didn't
[3:16:33] see apart from only and The
[3:16:38] Interpreter now I told him what's
[3:16:40] happening he said I think it's the
[3:16:43] government and brother you will go to
[3:16:44] jail
[3:16:49] I don't know what
[3:16:50] happened just a moment something came
[3:16:53] over me I told the
[3:16:55] brother let's preach on my mind I made
[3:16:58] up my mind if I have to go to jail and
[3:17:01] eventually die let me not die as a
[3:17:05] coward let me die when I'm preaching it
[3:17:08] as hardest as I
[3:17:11] can yes sir that's why the apostles God
[3:17:15] manifested himself in great power signs
[3:17:17] and
[3:17:19] wonders to the ex their Shadows can heal
[3:17:22] the sick they could ra the dead they
[3:17:25] were operating under's
[3:17:28] anointing because they were ready to
[3:17:31] submit to the
[3:17:33] calling they had a
[3:17:36] revelation of who they were are what
[3:17:39] they were supposed to do the calling of
[3:17:41] God upon their life they did not allow
[3:17:44] any man to play with it
[3:17:47] this is my calling this is the gift of
[3:17:50] God in my life this is my anointing I am
[3:17:53] born for this
[3:17:55] purpose and they took them before the
[3:17:58] judges before pent and one day Paul was
[3:18:02] put there they told him all right before
[3:18:05] King agria and I said you can now go but
[3:18:09] don't preach again in the name of Jesus
[3:18:13] did he stop did he stop I'm fearing now
[3:18:17] since they arrested me he did it more
[3:18:20] and more and
[3:18:21] more now I'm telling you revelation will
[3:18:24] behave make you behave
[3:18:28] crazy that you are playing an
[3:18:30] instrument someone offends
[3:18:38] you no

[3:19:03] I gotry there is a problem no

[3:46:15] um there is um a reminder
[3:46:21] here for those who gave the pledges for
[3:46:25] the
[3:46:28] convention we were we were invited to
[3:46:30] the Convention
[3:46:32] of spe this
[3:46:36] Easter so those of you who gave
[3:46:41] pledges um I was told that some of you
[3:46:44] just
[3:46:45] the
[3:46:48] amount but you forgot to write your
[3:46:51] contacts um the reason why you need to
[3:46:54] write your contact so that they can know
[3:46:55] who
[3:46:58] is so that they can follow
[3:47:00] up to ensure that you don't forget
[3:47:04] to there are also others who did not
[3:47:09] pledge um we would like to support those
[3:47:12] that convention
[3:47:15] um because I believe it will be a
[3:47:17] blessing to the
[3:47:19] bride actually one of the brothers that
[3:47:22] is going to be a speaker at that
[3:47:26] convention was scheduled to come to our
[3:47:29] youth
[3:47:32] camp um and he had even already bought
[3:47:35] the
[3:47:36] ticket and done several
[3:47:39] bookings but
[3:47:42] unfortunately he did not get his visa on
[3:47:44] time
[3:47:47] so that's why he did not
[3:47:49] come I saw he was announced uh
[3:47:54] brother Pastor Jonathan Martin Jonathan
[3:47:57] Martin from USA from us so uh really
[3:48:02] this convention convention are usually a
[3:48:06] blessing these conventions are usually a
[3:48:09] blessing whenever you hear Believers
[3:48:12] Gathering you always want to be a part
[3:48:14] of
[3:48:16] and also support so we want to support
[3:48:19] as a
[3:48:20] church so that's why we are making those
[3:48:24] pledges um if if you've not if you did
[3:48:27] not make the pledge last
[3:48:29] Sunday you can do so
[3:48:32] now brother if you can please pass those
[3:48:36] papers and make sure on the paper you
[3:48:39] write your
[3:48:41] name pledged amount
[3:48:45] and also you put your phone
[3:48:48] number don't forget your phone
[3:48:51] number the meetings is going to be 17th

[3:49:30] mind these brothers usually sing
[3:49:34] it
[3:49:38] that what makes me glad is one thing
[3:49:44] one thing that makes me glad is Jesus
