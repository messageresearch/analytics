called me to preach I started full-time Ministry when I was 13 years and uh at 15 years that was in the Anglican Church at 15 years the Lord showed me more scriptures more of his word to me showed me that there was more truth in the word that was not in my [Music] denomination and by that he revealed to me the end time message it all started by me being baptized in much water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and God has been good since he gave me riches that the world cannot give and when you receive those riches you can never be poor again amen and he gave me my beautiful wife can you

[Music] blessing am Rich by God's blessing how many are in senior six okay all of you right here that's wonderful I was going to ask you to come and sit close and I'm glad I am made Rich by God's blessing the says the blessing of the Lord it maketh rich and he adds no sorrow how many have ever heard of a Preacher a prophet called William Maran Bram here is what he said in 1965 he said I'm so glad for that that he being rich in [Music] Mercy he was just if he was just riching money if he was just riching materials which he is but yet the greatest thing is he is rich in Mercy now he is saying that God is rich in money he's rich in materials tell somebody God is Rich God is Rich so is there anybody who is poor here today if you are poor I want to say you can be made Rich this morning Hallelujah and the riches of God cannot cannot fall away when it comes it stays to the to the candidates I want you to be made Rich this morning I want it to be made Rich by the blessing of God know made Rich by God you can never be poor now when we talk about riches many times we think it is only money no it is more than money it is wisdom it is knowledge his understanding that can never fall away it will be permanent if it is from God listen when the blessing comes from God it can never be removed from by man but what comes by man will be removed by man but this morning I want that blessing of God that will make me Rich I can never be poor again hallelujah amen now I want you to listen here in the Book of Genesis let us see where we get this idea from in Genesis 22 verse1 I am going to read it only in English so if you you are if you want it in luganda read it in your Bible so listen to me because there are quite several verses and I want to keep time there are 18 verses so I want to read and you you follow me if you have the scripture you can put it up there and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham and said unto him Abraham and he said behold here I am and he said take now thy son thy only son Isaac whom thou lovest and uh get thee into the land of Moria and offer him here for there for a b offering upon uh one of the mountains which I will tell thee of and Abraham rose up early in the morning and said saddled his ass and took two of his younger men with him and Isaac his son and caved the wood uh for the burnt offering and Rose up and went unto the place which God had told him then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place a far off and and Abraham said unto his young man abide ye here with the US and I and the Lord will go Yonder and worship and come again to you and Abraham took the wood of the BT offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went uh both of them together and Isaac uh spake unto Abraham his father and said my father and he said here am I my son and he said behold the fire and the wood but where is the Lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide him s a larm for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to a place which God had told him off and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham Abraham and he said here mine and he said l lay not thy hand upon the Lord neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing that thou Hast not withheld thy son thy only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram CAU in a Thicket by his thorns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for B offering in the stad of his son and Abraham called the name of the Lord uh of that place Je praise God as it is said to this day in the Mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham Out of Heaven the second time and said by myself I have sworn sayith the Lord for because thou Hast done this thing and Hast not withheld thy son thy only son that in blessing I Will Bless thee and in multiplying but I want to show you here that Israel is a nation that came out of Abraham and they also came out of Isaac you see so they are they have a covenant this is the Covenant that God gave them that convenant of the blessing of God flows through that L you see they were blessed by God no man can cast them right now as I'm speaking to you Israel is being attacked from many corners from Lebanon is attacking Hamas from Gaza is attacking and other terrorists other nations that hate Israel and everybody is fighting against Israel people are going to the streets all over the world by thousands and thousands demonstrating that we want you know Israel to seize the fire but do you realize that the target of these people is to kill Israel and wipe it out of the M their plan is not for them to live in peace their plan is for Israel to be wiped away but Israel is saying This Is Our Land God gave it to us we will not live we can live with the rest of the tribes as long as you allow us to live in peace with you but the others are saying no we will wipe you away Iran for example heah they're saying the they saying the same Israel must be wiped away they Israel with a passion but do you know what there is nothing they can do to destroy Israel and the Bible says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem every Bible lover every Jesus Lover must not only love Israel they must pray for Israel and I tell you what Israel has a covenant with God and that Covenant cannot be removed it is a covenant that started with with Abraham and it was given to Abraham and that it would follow through Isaac his son do you know where all these others came they came from Hagar Hagar was a mistress of Abraham and got a son and that son was called is and he the he's the father great grandfather those Hamas andah that is true is historical isical but Israel comes from the linage of Isaac and God had given Abraham a promise and you know out of what happened because he told him listen to me he said now Abraham you remember Abraham at first never had a child and God promised him I will give you a son I will give you a son trust me believe me Abraham and SAR believed God and God gave them a son and when Abra when when when ISAC AR the child of the promise then God came back again and he said Abraham I know you believe me so here I have one more thing to say to you give me your son your only son give him to me many times when we hold something we don't want to let go whatever you have whatever you have if it's not Jesus it is nothing it is nothing if you think you have knowledge it is nothing if you think you have wisdom is nothing if you think you have money it is nothing it's all nothing without him all nothing without him and I can prove that to you by the Bible he is a rich man who came to Jesus and spoke to him and said good Master what can I do to inherit etal life Jesus told him go and do the law he said I have fulfilled The Works of the law from the time I was a child ah Jesus told him you have done well but there is one more thing go sell all your riches give it to the poor come follow me the rich man was sad he went away sad in his if you don't believe Jesus you will go our side I always say body that hears the gospel being preached and you don't believe it whether you believe it or not you can never be the same again if you if you don't believe it will go but if you believe it you will be happy you will be happy you will not only be happy you will also be rich now this Young Ruler he went side because he did not have Jesus the only thing you needed to do is what Jesus said sell everything and take and follow me oh are we ready to do that to sell everything and follow him we cannot trust anything else we only trust him s everything and follow me and here then comes we go back to Abraham so then God comes back to Abraham and says now Abraham my friend I want your son give me your son your only son you must be willing to give up he said I will do whatever God says You must be willing to say I will do whatever God say as long as it is his I will do whatever he say and Abraham said son come follow me he took some of his servants and together they went and the Bible tells me when Abraham reached a place he saw the place that God told him on and he knew to he thought to himself there is no way he can go to that place with with people who are not in the convenant so he looked back and he told all his servants please stay here with the donkeys me and my son are going up on the hill toship the Bible says he that will not leave his mother and father and brother sister blah blah blah blah blah not worthy of me sometimes people want to believe the message they want be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ but they fear what mama will say what Papa would say me my mother was my mother disowned me because of this truth but after some years right now as I'm speaking to you I am her pastor for three years for three years she couldn't look at me I couldn't look at because of this truth if you lose if you save your life you lose it but if you lose your life you will save it and Abraham looked at the servants and told them stay with the oh I love my mom I believe in obeying a parent but when it comes to the word I believe in obeying the word so even me at that time I show my mama I told my brothers I told my sisters stay with the donkeys as for me I am going up on the mountain I am going to worship God I'm going to believe every word of God maybe if you have a friend who doesn't want you to believe the world you have a girlfriend boyfriend who is nagging you all the time doesn't want you to believe the word must be able to tell them stay with the donkeys stay with the donkeys as for me I am going on the mountain I am going on the mountain to Worship the Lord hallelujah hallelujah and then we find you know that they stayed with the donkeys they didn't know what was going to take place on the mountain but guess what Abraham went on the mountain with his son Isaac and when they arrived there Abraham ISAC realized there is something missing his father had told him that we cannot worship without an offering so if you come to church come with an offering don't come empty-handed come with an offering are you hearing me is a way of worship and the first offering is your broken heart contrite spirit you must be willing to submit yourself to the word of God whatever he says I will believe it and then now you can talk about the money now here they didn't have an offering he knew somehow God is able to provide a sacrifice do what God is word saying God will do the rest God will do the rest will do the rest hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah praise God praise God will show up will show up and when they arrived there you know Abraham put in his eort fear not don't fear anything at all don't fear anything at all because the blessing of God gives wisdom the blessing of God brings Rememberance the blessing of God will give you what you need in the time you need it now those of you who are not reading and youing around okay you have one little chance remain right now two things you can you can really be serious with God and forsake your evil ways your sins and believe in the Lord Jesus Christ as your personal savior Point number one and then you trust God number two you you do as much effort as you can in this remaining few God doesn't need a year or two years God needs a moment Hallelujah a moment you mean to tell me if I was not serious for two years my God is able in a moment in one day two days three you know you can read something but the last minute and it comes in the ex who will do that will provide a sacrifice so you can trust him knowing that he cannot fail you oh my God he used to show me things which were coming in an examp he even showed me my results before our God is the God of All Seasons if you trust him in your life if you trust him in your education TR him in everything you do God cannot fail you hujjah and while there Abraham you know God called the place Jehovah G and he began to untie his son to untie his son removing the the shackles that b him and he hugged him and he took the sacrifice together with his son and they offered it to the Lord God provided a sacrifice here is the sa to being richening to the voice of God this is the voice of God the gospel which preached to you hereen to it trusting God wholehearted being ready to sacrifice everything for the word of God sacrifice your cultures let me say
