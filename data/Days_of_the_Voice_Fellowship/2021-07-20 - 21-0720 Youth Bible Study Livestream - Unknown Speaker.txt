amen Amen brother can you please change your seat you okay you enjo this maybe I was mistaken now before we get started today I want to say that I am not happy I'm not happy because of uh the way we are progressively reducing our effort and reducing our seriousness to the cause which we decided to embark on uh you know the Bible the scripture says that whatever your hand finds to do do it with all your heart whatever now if it is bad do all your if it is good good do it with all your heart but whatever your hand finds to do do it with all many of you are students and at this time there is no school because there is lockdown in the country so what is it that you are doing now that's more important than this Bible study honestly I don't see any I must only appreciate brother oo brother and Jo who try to keep time today the rest of you I know by the shame and po at church but you also arrived here quite late you you arrived on time not in time you're supposed to arrive 30 minutes earlier so you can be able to get into the spirit of the service because when you arrive late then you are not you know you're not oriented well for the for the for the service the was fting seriously with with the machines when he supposed to be starting to do that about 30 minutes ear or even 1 hour this is not acceptable I see even those of you sister got here about minutes late same thing you also got got on a bit late I think you were the last to get on Zoom this is not acceptable why because we given our time you know I wanted to imagine how much how much that goes into preparation look even this is still veryy looking for the things supposed to be looking for quite quite early friends praise the Lord praise the Lord again this is not acceptable this is not AC acceptable last last service I think we also AIT late some not talk about it but I think right to talk about it during this time are you here yes because if we are going to do this in a productive way we must be ready to sacrifice our old to it for us to be able to benefit mutually out of it uh you know those of you uh who have been a bit close to me you know have been not very perfectly perfect in my health personally because of the much strain these meetings are having with me you know Tuesday Wednesday Friday Sunday and it's not only during the program but also during the before because I have to prepare myself also do think that I just walk away from whatever I was doing and I just come here I have to sit down prepare pray you understand so and then all of the sudden you come and people are late 30 minutes late 20 minutes this is unacceptable it's unacceptable so the Zeal that you we must continue or else we should not do this at all if we want the lord to bless us out of this we should really be in for it we should be serious about it h to the extent that one two I don't see two people here you know either they are late or they are or they are not coming at all you see so which means they do not take it serious I would rather have a Bible study or a church age book study with two people when they really into it they are really seeing how it is blessing their lives they seeing how much it is impacting them you know than having a whole group of 20 plus when are not serious how many agree with what I'm saying so all of you practically agree then that means let us change let us change let us be serious if you're going to connect online and you know you need to have brother K help you get connected contact him 30 minutes before the service remind him 20 minutes at least 10 minutes before the service you should be connected then uh promptly at the time that we agreed I am always here I start the service always on time and so uh I think we really need to change on that we need to repent we need to repent of our sins how many are willing to repent how many are willing to repent for sure go go God bless you if you're willing to repent sister PE are you willing because those who are not willing to repent we shall not allow them to partake of this meeting you know I want it to be that we are in one Accord one spirit you see if someone comes like that 30 minutes late when we have covered almost half a chapter what should we do brother okay if we had started promply on our time 3 p.m. someone walks in like that what we do we just ch them we tell them brother God bless you Sister God bless you but you have come too late because whatever we have covered we have to cover it again and that is not acceptable so that's why we lay the service today to wait for everyone to be around so that now we can get into the more important things you see even I'm not happy at all with this brother who is working on this as well you know because I believe that you need to arrive on time prepare very well whatever is not working well you already know it in time so well I hope that that message has reach home can we now get into business uh brother Marvin thank you for the prayer now uh how many have their church edes so all of you do okay so uh sisters sister Joan and I believe you also have yours I TR you also have yours okay so um yeah brother Sam and brother brother just found me having finished re those who are coming late and we agree that those who walk in late again we will not allow them to be a part of this program I want to believe that youate because youon as well it is unacceptable to come minutes the Bible stud uh can we please give the brothers chair okay um no you can you can bring that right here this side or this side you can sit here brother okay so we have brother John brother John you're welcome God bless you and uh I think my brother here I did not see him you are the one who came here on Su on I'm happy to see you today God bless you what is another brother a brother who was supposed to be here also who did I hand him over to was it not to you yes what happened yes did you talk to you you didn't yes so you did not do your job yes I didn't do my J that is ABS uh yes sorry okay so to the new brother that has joined us for the first time joh is it your first time also today who is working on this thing please we need to work can someone be here and as well yeah all right uh I will ask again how many have finished the CH I always ask how many I hope there someone finished no oh how many have finished the Ephesian chap not okay so by now I was expecting that all of us have finished the church the Ephesian church at least and then we can be able to finalize it today so you said you've not finished where are you where are sorry is it English this is I need this one this is supposed to be for Ruth who is Ruth Ruth can you come for your book over here [Music] okay so I think we should get started so many have not finished not many quite few but uh I want us to do a little bit differently today and before I I we get into the sharing into the Bible study I want to read you a testimony is that okay I want to read you a testimony regarding what happened with a pastor one of the elders now in this message and what it is that the Lord did through his life and how this book impacted his life praise the Lord amen and some of you have already been blessed with the services in their Church You' watched it you've been a part of it how watch was it you brother only oh yes but also the other day you know I also placed a few if you remind me after this service I'll give you a clip and you really enjoy their worship so and and so just before we started this meeting this meeting here he shared with me a testimony and uh he was saying that uh he said he said by the vers it was 1965 at the meetings one of the meetings that babanam preached in a place called sh in the in the USA he attended those meetings so he says his family that's where they their family first got this book of course he was young at the time you listen to this testimony you really enjoyed so he says shortly thereafter we left the IND dependent free from organization Pentecostal church and began as a family to read the church ede book as a what so him and his family started to read the church book this book this one he and his family like we are also one big family right yes but now we are from also different families but for them as a family they were reading this book sitting in our living room just like we SE in our living room here on Sunday because they have just started you know getting into the message we would each read a paragraph As each took their turn reading and as I read that I was like my I think we can do something like that today I was inspired I felt like we can do something like that today we've been doing something close to that but I think we can do something like that today right yes at that time I was 11 years old who's 11 today oh s here okay so the video is off the people who are on here canister oh yeah I can see over there but by the shame there's quite a bit of Darkness there so no one can see can you raise up your hand okay up up up up yes that's his sister Rachel over there she's 11 years old so this brother at that time was also 11 years for other services he says we would often play a tape of brother bham brother bham or someone would preach you know sometimes they would play A T or someone would preach in 1968 who was born then in 1968 none of us was born there we moved from the city of Bia which was separated fromport by a river to farm about an hour drive away I turned 14 that year are you hearing although I had given my life to Christ at 5 right around that time I was baptized and filled with the Holy Ghost so if you are not yet baptized get baptized if you not yet filled with the holy ghost seek the Holy Ghost be filled with the Holy Ghost in February 1970 before I turned 16 in September I started fulltime Ministry you know what fulltime Ministry means what does it mean huh yeah but what exactly does it mean so you people don't know what Ministry means means yes yes he gave his entire time to fulltime to fulltime Min just like me I have fulltime Ministry I do fulltime Ministry fulltime Ministry is when you are not employed in another secular job but when you are yielding all your time to the ministry to the work of the Lord to the work of of the of the ministry are you following me yes so he says when he became 16 by that time he entered into fulltime Ministry so who is 16 here who 16 my God at your age he went into fulltime Ministry he became a preacher and he yielded all his time to do just that think about it I started fulltime Ministry so in 1972 who was born there still no one in 1972 I along with other family members moved from our home meetings to an old abandoned church building and and evening light Tabernacle as we know it today started that's their Church in 1976 while teaching on the church Ed book while teaching on the what if you raise it up while teaching on the church this very book he was reading it and teaching from this for the people right yes the ho ghost and my wife received the baptism of the Holy Ghost after that series of teaching a number of years later I went through it again teaching it paragraph by the church Ed is a wonderful doctrin correct book amen the devil has done what he can to discredit it but it remains one of the most important tools that we have at our disposal because it contains most of the fundamental doctrines of the message the Lan age I am so thankful hallelujah amen praise the Lord amen so I thought I should share this testimony of brother team because he is talking of years before we were born and it did them good if he did them good then if God was good then he's still good all the time if God was good then is good today so if people were filled with the Holy Ghost people were delivered you understand people receive the revelation of the word while studying the word the same word we have has not change the same Bible they had then it has not it is the same today so if we really stud it with all our heart God the things then he will do he will do I'm looking for another word he will do now now hallelujah amen so if that is our expectation then how must we be whenever we know that that this is a day for us to get deep into these things again you can't wait you are running to come in the fellowship you know yes you not be one of those people saying ah every day every almost every day we what is this kind of thing you will be into it if you are not interested please don't come okay only those who are interested then we shall enjoy this amen amen all right so having said that can we now please get into it now for the sake of our brothers who have joined us today i' would like to have one person here preferably you brother to explain to the people to them what we have done covered from the Ephesian from the revelation of Jesus Christ from the beginning of the book and the second chapter then now the third chapter give a brief summary on what we have covered so far for them to be able to understand what this book is all about and when we talk about this book is it a second Bible please explain to them why we are studying this book all right I think I'll give it to you brother for at least 10 minutes I know I did not ask you to prepare for that but I know you were here when we were studying and I know you also know so please take your time and explain but do not be over 10 minutes I hope you have a time there I mean a phone or something where you can see time no 10 minutes exactly Andover yeah I'm requ okay that sounds good you're welcome we soy to here brother so he got studying this book found us when we Onan church we just started last so we started this book from the the revelation of Jesus Christ as you can see an exposition is not talks of how God deals with us spiritual Israelites so he deals with us very higher form yes so is by this book is written by our Prophet The Prophet for day prophet he is the doesn't thees Voice doesn't die stilles when why why I can say that the word lives because the word is and the says yest so this book talks of the church ages means as we there are not different churches but it tells us of how God was revealing himself the same way let me say something brief to the revelation of Jesus Christ I think all of us we have our books the revelation of Jesus Christ we shared something small this some you may Wonder rudis when I reing us to the book because Revelation remember it was it's a book that Jesus himself wrote [Music] was taken to the island ofos then him book ofation of all books the it's entirely written by so so we studed from this Revelation why the devil take Genesis and Revelation these two books and Sh a few things that the devil hates Genesis because Genesis talks of how reveals the plans of the devil Satan reveals the trigs reveals how kind is really say this and that so Genesis and then Revelation Revelation tells us of things that will happen to Revelation it's revealed to us how the end of the devil be so there The Book of Revelation why I believe if I canuse this sat knows the end how the end will be for him and his kingdom and those who worship him him are those who take what brings to them the mind the mind you accept it then we moved to Ang came to when he was in Exel I can ex because they taken him there to torture him but that was an [Music] advantage why I when he was there knew that that was the only place to me was like an isolation we also learned that as was isolated each and every person has to be isol you have to isolate from other friends other things for you to chist just John was taken away no when they took him they thought they going to T him not knowing on the other hand some perfect was to be so when he was there him but it was for the good of you and me there are so many things learn from this I believe from this I believe I will share with you Vision we also went through uh I can say kinds of conduct think that we saw how things should be done if you have an expected end of something like for instance if you want to get football must be in the of playing football to get today Crown at last certain things you must for go for you to have that expect you know that he knows the plans he has for usam us but give used there are for these spirit I I can call them Spirits because God is spirit and do think he is a spirit himself and therefore we saw that in whatever you do find out what spirit is driving or else before you follow someone something thise let me use you have a friend I know Solon is my friend I should be knowing what brother Solon is so you cannot go like play football or I have a f i don't know don't know so before you follow first be what who exactly so where you be yeah then we also we went through the sa we learn what is US Sab is a day a Sunday ISB well that was then if I can put it but even if it was then we realize that those people at that time when we talk about the Old Testament about the isra they failed to keep that day though it was their they failed to keep that day found that they could go into the and go out of the going into the we're talking about the time they going in for Fellowship so when they entered in for that Fellowship as we can say Sunday morning they enter in yes they were holy of course whener have to come holy just like the Pharisees the Sadducees and herodians were the at that time they walked with such so we also learned that when go into their they only kept it holy for one day after the Sabbath they go and forn and steal and K Mur that was how they to that is how they had their only one day a week but then after that we also came to learn that that was the shadow of the things to come of the things to come now that's now in the New Testament I'm not saying that we should only on the new part and leaving the part it's the Bible is for the education of the body the body of Christ and then we found out that this sabbath what are we required to do in theath how get theb then they say that the Sabbath was rest and day you rest from work today you rest from other things you just go to church come back home Sit Stay enjoy with friends found that yeah that's true rest and then here tells us of how we can get the rest BS says that come me and I give you rest Come As You Are that's true that's right come as you are but he didn't say come and stay as you are come as you are you know friends tell I'm like he said come I it's true come as you are come as you are he's accepting you to come to conference and then when you come you have terms and conditions he has his terms and conditions so so if you accept his terms and conditions in this very found we need to enter into the rest and remain in that rest and the rest the sabath rest I can is the baptism of the so that when you then have in you then you will find rest you rest from your activities forance if I can give you this example if now in the night you went for club dance dance dance physically I can say that you're not to start with you're dancing you're busy you're not resting but one at home then that as brother sister we see you all the time course I know busy quite busy so you rested and then we found that this is entering into by one Spirit bapti into that body and you be a member of that body it means you stay in him and him is the word it means you have to stay in the word and that's how you can beess distress means you seing from your works and we read the scriptures The Works of the flesh saw that you stealing all that doesn't mean that you rest from your daily work because he also said that I bless the hands the works of your hands and you told nead that don't you know I love to in Affairs of so it means that the works that was talking about the of theh stealing using Envy those were the works of of theh and then we saw that it was when you give now your life when you enter the you from and then takes lead he takes the will from your hands you stop doing and then he starts the work if you have got the rest how can you that you the rest take with the word the fruits of that Holy Spirit Well you canot like therefore we need to see by by the life that you the fruits when I Ste how would you react will it be so will electrons be so much excited if they excited then I can say that but if I step and you knew me as brother said brother sorry it's again telling me apologizing then I can go back and I take with the word when you know they try to Abus him beat that is the life to just for so that is how we can know that you're put in risk as I said we can share this with you person that's what I can say all for now I can yeah God bless you I know that you would like to continue and we need to thank God for what our brother has shared amen amen the other thing that I'd like to say is that uh brother if you can please take it up make it a point I do not know how but meet these brothers and take them through what it is that we have covered in detail now that would be good uh he also did speak about the prophet brother bam and he called him our prophet is not like hour as in hour hour this 20 people here or 15 people here no hour it's not like a cult or some kind of denomination or some kind of grouping or something no William Bram is one of the seven Messengers that God has sent to the whole planet Earth among the Gentiles from the time of Jesus to the the second from the time of the physical first coming of Jesus to the time of the second coming of Jesus there is a church which is chesus Christ you see I have to use English because we have other people from other countries who may not understand luganda right here online but brother what is your name how is your English do you understand 100% no what percent you [Music] understand 50 okay brother where are you where are you brothera okay can you talk to us yes okay okay I'm trying to unmute so can talk to us brother we still waiting I'm doing this for one soul but you have to understand that Jesus said you can leave the 0 n and reach out one soul brother where you what has happening to your connection are you here it's okay oh he's not he's not around he not around okay all right is not around there aan because this supposed to be youth youth Mee understand so brother brother I'll try to connect you with Brother so that you can also have very good discussion on this area and we also to shall meet for for for Hallelujah so uh that's that now we have been from there we have now reached from the Ephesian church and and I know that can you please put on the uh the video for us yeah right thank you now brother brother Char I see you here and before we we get deep into this uh I would also like you to give give us a testimony because that brother we saw him there last time we actually we had a little bit of interaction here and now you sent us a testimony how he was baptized ah I'll be very happy if you can be able to give us that testimony are you there brother Char okay for some reason I do not know you might okay I think we shall ask him to do that at the end of the at the end of the meeting all right so I'd like us to go deep into this now we had reached on the Ephesian Church age and uh here is where we were now doing going to get into the study of what church age was what it means when it was and what message for that church and what God did then remember what God did then he will continue to do today and he will do also tomorrow because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and oh you do not see that verse where is that verse by the way I wanted to ask sisters brothers were so fast Hebrews 138 amen what does it say sister fortunate yday uhhuh but you didn't you paraphrased it says Jesus Christ yes Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever hallelujah amen so he does the same well he is the same and uh he he does the same All Through the Ages so now we see that Ephesians was the beginning of the Gentile Church age and we have we we had read really the introduction but a little bit of it here and there but I I would I would like some of us some of you maybe as select a few we read just like we saw this brother I think it would be so nice if we can read because a portion I was personally going to read but when I read this oh my the people will have to read it themselves so I would like us to begin from I do not know I was looking at on the iPad but at the part where it says uh th what the church was at Pentecost is the standard has somebody seen that part the brother who is on the on the laptop you should be able to give us these portions here so that if someone not yet seen it the one reading can be able to read direct from the screen yes you've seen it page 67 okay so I want a sister and also a brother uh who is going to be reading uh and then 2 by two later okay you are ready to start can you please bring the brother okay you're going to begin reading from there brother can you get started okay yes can we continue waiting for you or we go for to another can we come to you brother You' seen it yes okay that's what the church was at Pentecost is a standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the Church of yes no you need to read that again reread that yes thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God at Pentecost has to keep on doing until the church ages close what did God do at Pentecost you remember we talked about it last time can we have by show of hand someone tell us what God did what happened at Pentecost number one no one by one one by one so and you speak loud people can be able to hear you yes brother speaker brother Jo yes [Music] you spoke many things and they we want us to hear one by one at the day of Pentecost what happened initially let us take it level by level one by one yes the belever the Holy Ghost say it the believer spoke in Tong they prophesied and they prophesied and they prophesied okay so the ho ghost but before the Holy Ghost said what happened then yes what happened they were oh people come on before the Holy Ghost came down what happened they were gaed in the upper room doing what pray praying okay what else then yeah yes go ahead the sound of a a rushing Mighty Wind yes please explain your point very well yes when when it came remember mhed speaking m H yes are you hearing are you hearing yes did they speak in ttimes did they interpret please did they speak in ttimes yes did they interpret why didn't they interpret so are you telling me it's okay to speak in tongues without interpretation God bless you can you C for this sister just went through that almost for one hour yes it is okay but not in in church it must be interpreted not silent brother brother please that doct someone is saying that we should be silent in the church who told you we should we should speak T in church amen can you say Amen to that amen we should speak Tong in church but they must be accompanied with interpretation if there is no interpretation it is a sound without meaning we see it all over these Pentecostal churches they just speak but without meaning and therefore it becomes useless and many of those tongues are not genuine tongues it is meant to show that they are in the spirit but when they really not in the spirit so if you are you never switch of that BL so if they are in the spirit they must always interpret those Tong all right then they spoken tongues and did not interpret because the tongues they were speaking were where yes what did you say brother there were Tes of men that could be heard by men who were there at the time hallelujah oh sister I forgotten the words you told me I wish I would speak it right now in your tongue say that again yeah did I say that right yes I think I tried now did you see when I speak that she'll understand but some of you will not or almost all of you will not maybe one person or two you understand if someone speaks your tongue you understand you don't need interpretation right so these people spoke in tongues of the people of the Ethiopians of the Egyptians of the libyans of the of the ugandans amen of the Kenyans you understand there was no need of interpretation and then after that what happened next yes sister what happened after they spok in tongues and we all amazed and then what happened next sorry the Holy Ghost came down and what happened when the Holy Ghost came down listen the Holy Ghost is is the one that had already come down and the impact of it BR Tong unto them he says they came as clo Tong of fire are you following me like the said he divided himself among the people then they started to speak in tongues and the people here what I want and the people who are here some of you don't know are you there brother can you read the portion for us pet together into the temple okay excuse me brother sh I can't you I can't see you here then do it okay go ahead now Peter and John went up together went up together into the temple PR being the N hour and a certain man L from his mother's wom was cared they laid daily at the gates of the Temple come they were all with one in one place and suddenly there came from and it filled all the house where they were sitting and they appeared unto them clothing Tong like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other Tong the spirit gave thems and there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews heot men out of every nation under heaven now when this was noised abroad the multitude came together and were confounded because that

they were amazed and they say are these not all galileans then after that what happened okay first all verse 20 verse 37 what did they say now when they heard this they were pricked in their hearts and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do men and Brethren what shall we do and what did they answer them brother John if you're reading if you're following verse 38 what did Peter answer I as John okay yes over there yes brother John tell us uhuh uhuh uhuh in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit amen amen is it amen okay again maybe youto repent is the first thing uhhuh and be bed and be baptized uhhuh everyone of you every one of youuh in the name uhuh in the name of Jesus of the father and of the son and of the [Applause] yeah Amen brother I need you to answer me but I thought father holy spirit so why are the Catholics Bing father son Holy Spirit and so does it mean that someone if he the name of our Lord Jesus Christ is not correctly yes does it mean that simp that because and beap every one of you in the name of Jesus chist for what brother joh and reive Hallelujah and he says This Promise continue the promise you uhhuh children mhm to all that as many shall call even as many as the Lord Our God shall even in 202 and four whatever it is today we in21 still calling everybody say God is still calling is call is he calling someone today he's still calling Hallelujah so as many as the Lord Our God shall now that's what God did on the Pentecost have you heard so I can say on the there talking hearing on people being fill with baptizing on there was being Bap in the name of Jesus Pentecost there was preaching on pting there was repenting yeah I love this on P remission of there was remission of P there was come on now there was evangelism hallelujah oh my feel excited right now P there was singing even rejoicing there was being amazed there was prophesying there was come on I love that part you know there was what is it down there testimonies Brother P that was designment there is not yet yes brother God bless you there was pray P oh brother you are dry forgiveness of forgiveness of sins God bless you we come on Miracles we performed brother what else speaking in Tong speak we finish that was speaking in tongues right but also there was a p of fire where are you people you see in the Bible there was the of fire those things were all there on the day of Pentecost Hallelujah there was promise there was a promise and said that promise of the what a promise of the what a promise of the what friends A Promise This Promise of what this promise of you being baptized and then being filled with Holy Ghost and that promise was given Hallelujah and today that promise is still given to me now the true church of the Lord will be like the church at what can you wor for us to go back and can you go back where you were reading the church book brother and continue from there now because you read the says what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is not pattern no matter what the schar say no matter what a preacher say no matter what aor say if a tells you today there is no more feeling of the Holy Ghost today there's no more speaking in Tong today there's no more rolling on the floor today there is no more healing today there's no more miracles there is no more come on Dancing there is no more baptism there is no more remion there is no more repentance you just know those are liar no baptism in the name of Jesus Christ it doesn't matter that is a liar what was p is the pattern is the standard oh can you help me and shout and say is the standard stand yes God has not changed that pattern what go Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages God bless all of you all right continue brother yes hey wait this thing is going through the whole church ages by the way not only at the PC not only Even in our day all through so we can now be able to see all the church ages as they go as they as we progress we can be able to know that that was the messenger and that God used these people because we see the things that we on the P we see them in their Church H even today we can be able to say this is the True Church of God if we see the things we see on the day of pente are you following me so even if people believe in shouting dancing and talking T but if they don't believe in baptism in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we know that is not the true church you see we cannot find the standard Hallelujah okay continue SCH oh wait a moment brother even if they can baptize in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and there is no speaking in tongues and shouting and dancing and we can now say that is not the real Church oh you are feeling to say that we can now say that's not the true church because there must still be heal there must be speaking in t there must still be giving of the prise of God there must be all these signs Anders there must be the manifestation right if it a true church it should have both it should have both it should have now some people say that those are the pcal babies they do those things for us we don't say that the what the not only the pattern but it is also the standard it's the what stand amen all right brother go on reading schs may tell you the apostolic age is over don't you believe it such a statement is wrong when two CS first of all it is wrong to Suppose there aren't any more Apostles because original means please follow El I ask you to tell us what the was reading okay and there are many sent ones today but they are called missionaries as long as men are being called and with the word of Life there apol Hallelujah so in other words what does Apostle mean right an apost means aent one I feel sent me to go to people you are an apost or you have an Apostolic anointing right does God have apost today amen okay uhuh secondly secondly they refer to an age of manifested holy ghost power as been over since the Bible has been completed that is untrue that is what you foll they say they to age of meaning they meaning the scholars the theologians they they said that the age of manifestation of the Holy Ghost in power h ah that is over since the since the Bible has been completed it is over brother K is that over is God has God finished manifesting himself in power so we can still cast up demons now so we can still pray in t so we can still heal the sick so we can still dance in the spirit are you hearing this thing yes why oh because what because why come on now hallelujah amen sister are you following very well are you getting what we are saying I'm talking to you sister are you hearing are are you following very well amen amen I'm glad you're following all right uhhuh then continue brother continue brother mhm there is not even one scripture that suggests that but many conclusively state otherwise here is our proof that both of these charges are false acts 2: 38 39 then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized everyone of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for for the promises unto you and to your children and to all that are far even as many as the Lord Our God shall the promise of Power with which the apostles were ended at p is to yous Hallelujah you and to your children the Jews and to all that are far the Gentiles and to as many as the Lord Our God shall call both Jew and gentil until he stops calling the pcal message and power will not hallelujah oh my people drunk right now that P what message first first first message and power will not until he stops calling has it stopped calling no so why do some people say even in this message that the PC those things you know you know those things for young in the faith young in the faith it has not ceased God is still manifesting himself in power God deliv even if you here and bound by some kind of demon I'm telling you you come for you if you know aing you you will beiver because power is still do you believe it how many I believe it that still here where among the Believers amen I believe that with all my heart all right can we now continue yes brother continue come on what the church had at Pentecost is inable rights is inable Right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and Gifts of the Holy Ghost oh W you people yes are you he these things yes let me have someone else read that part because I'm doubting whether they understanding who else who else come on brother brother read that part yeah yes brother brother read that part no right right there right there please watch me okay are okay read that part what the church at p is inen Right originally she had the pure word of God she had the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs and wonders and gifts for the Hallelujah there are two things in that paragraph one is what what is is what is coming there one the pure word of the true word of God which does talk about visas getting riches doing that and this and that but the word which shows them to be changed which chose the sner to be changed which CH the drunker to be changed you understand which delivers you out of your sins and prepares you to go the Rapture that's the p word of God number one number two the power of the spirit the power of the spirit which is manifested in and W Hallelujah that Church Must Believe in those two things oh my excuse me for the excitement she must have that pure word of God one two she must also have that power that power that what power the power of the spirit manifested in diverse signs come on say shes and he says wonders are not seeing it you can read it too feel free now signs wonders and Gift of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah so those things must be in that church let me tell you for me I literally get bored when I'm in a church that just come read the scriptures talk a little bit go home I feel so bored I believe the True Church of God must have these things am whereby there is a manifestation of the Holy Ghost in signs in wonders in gifts of the Holy Ghost what are those the Bible speaks of them right yes you know discernment of spirits you know uh uh prophecies uhhuh speak speaking in tongues interpretation of Tong come on Visions uh what else dreams even dreams dreams what else healing healing the gift of healing yes what else yes of yesh are you come on give me give me more huh yeah even Revelations yes yeah even that one okay look interpretation yeah yeah interpretation that's the gift of interpretation okay so all those gifts must be in the body of Jesus Christ yeah thank you brother brother is giving us another one here knowledge the gifts of knowledge right so all these gifts must be in the body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah am where not just someone is fornicating the whole time and you can't even find him out he just hidden among you let me see let me tell you people I have seen God exposing people here I've seen God exposing yes because Among Us I know at there are Gifts of knowledge they Gifts of of of designment even visuals and and I've seen some exposed whereby they can't even Escape because they they have been exposed whereby God talks what you're doing and even the fact he gives them friends we believe in a god like that so if you are going to be in this church and you think you will hide your sins you are I'm already begin to feel sorry for you all right because those gifts to edify the church bless the church to make it strong you understand not to the where the people are so cold where you can't even say Amen or you can't even you know you're just just all the time you know just why because you're so heavy there is no moving of the Holy Ghost right there must be moving of there must be moving of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah I love what brother is saying he say there Zer temper jurges oh I love that right there is no temper of the Holy Ghost you understand that is not right should be a church by the word comes in power and full force also deliver let me tell you been in whereby you are preaching you are preaching and someone is delivered right you're preaching and someone is the day just here praying and singing people were getting delivered you not here how many were here up your hand yeah yeah you saw what God was doing those are the things I believe in right and some when you are not in it already and things happen

please please just come just come you're getting out of the spirit you know because he was [Applause] singing let me tell you where get into the is getting out of order right you we must not allow that kind of atmosphere you know we must accept to be in a temperature where the Holy Ghost is high Hallelujah is high where you accept to be moved AC you know as if you in a classroom listen toct when the word is going on it AM stand upout you understand jump up you understand stand up yes yeah do something like that you understand you so you understand friend whereby with the when the word of God come it doesn't it changes you it makes you feel in a special way it makes you feel what whereby when it touches you you yield to him you yield yourself you don't just be there you know yeah let the pastor preach and then I go what time is it man it's taking too long is a problem there a problem with you you are you are used to the Amazon temperature you know just very low you know oh God help us but what did did say brother that portion again we Hebrews 2 1-4 yes the Bible says therefore we ought to give the more Hest he to the things which we have done lest at any time we should let them sleep uhuh if the words spoken by Angels was steadfast and every transgression and disobedience braet to the word received a just recompense of reward how shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation if we neglect so great salvation which at the began to be spoken by the Lord by the Lord hallelujah and was confirmed unto us by them that had him continue God also bearing them winess uhhuh both with signs and wonders and diverse oh my God and Gift of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah according his own will now all of us together let us read that next paragraph that original Church wased did you hear that it was not organized by men so it wasn't men control in that church it wasn't Deon body wasn't trusty body it wasn't so and so body that original church was not organized by men it was not a religious organization right but how was it organized and L by the Holy Ghost Hallelujah where when you want to go on the road and preach don't need to seek for permission from Pastor amen and when Pastor tells you s you cannot go Pastor it is all right but I thought it is good for me to do no come on yes the Holy Ghost has led you to go come and ask for bless Pastor pray for me I feel like I want to go on the road yeah's a f man he brother go preach the gospel for you send with blessing right it wasn't very big it wasn't very big okay read on now it was and it was and and it was so if

persecute you they they must persecute you they must what I tell you they must what let me your testimony right now I telling you we are in the present present day of these things happening and this God has also not changed is the same go right now as we talking about persecution let me read you a testimony here this testimony is from West night near Sudan AR I've been there and I've met this

they have almost 10,000 people you know in some countries you know Congo there are even more than 20,000 they can feel one church that believe this message amen but generally speaking it will not be a very large group okay if you consider the Believers over who believe the truth in every generation been the minority okay so don't expect to be a very what chur a very big church it will be than despised it was oppressed it was persecuted unto death but it was true stay with the original word pattern Hallelujah you remember the original word pattern number one word of number two don't summize

ACT of by that that is how it is done the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost the true church of today will try to approximate that and messers to the churches having the same of God them will try approximate the [Music] pa the true MERS will be the come who was free of all men sold out to and the word of only the ho I think we should something this he says now don't get here when I say that God and his ways never change yes I do not say that the church and it Messengers not change what I can say this I'm giving in my submission amen we all know that yes and be

miracles don't we we believe that there will be a miracle that God will do for those for those guys let's believe for that and God will surely make it hallelujah amen H it's not planned but you see how the does it it's just marvous God is proving to us the we reading and not just reading reading information it is real amen it is real amen it's just the officer C who just told me theyeas is harmonized regarding Isaac now but now this issue we PR for was for the GS Isaac has been in prison he slept there even but God has given him Grace and I know he's going to be B now to preach even more now Hallelujah okay shall we now proceed and find a place where we can finish for today where were we okay can we read can one of us read from but what I said was that because of the unchanging I don't know which point you were explaining do you remember what you explaining can you finish up with that brother Isaac are you sleeping oh you're reading who okay I invite yeah that before now don't get when I say that God and his ways never change I did not say that the church and its Messengers could not change the church isn't good so she can change yeah so I was trying to explain something this can't change and then you know the church can change the church is talking here like the days of the voice the days of the voice change yes because has uh three kinds of Believers yeah non believers Believers and True Believers those ones without faith those ones with little faith NE ones and then those genu ones with real faith those are True Believers you find that the ones who will not change are going to be like let me say something about that how will they be like because God is the word so they will take this word and it will be manifest in their lives they will take it believe it taking meaning believeing the one accepting it their hearts in the same church then that word will be manifested in their lives amen and then they will be one with Christ so that will be the person who change in that church m because we aware that that will be the wife the wife will be the word God is the word and the wife will have to be the word that's the and then here it says that God does not change and then before you leave that point people may be confused God is the word and the church is the wife what does that mean how can we you know the the bride or the wife it means that the word is God and God is the husband of the church and we are his wife we are his bride white or bright Revelation 197 what does it say is a very common verse you can Sur without reading it yes say it loudly the bride ready yeah but how does it begin let us and rejoice and give H to him the church is the wife and him the husband of the church hallelujah amen okay in the interest of time shall we now continue from there and we take it from after explained the true church will always try to be like the original atart are youw I am reading yes the true church will always try to be like the original at Pentecost yes the true church of today will try to approximate that first that first one and the messengers of the churches having the same spirit of God in them will try to approximate the Apostle Paul yes they won't be exactly like him but the true Messengers will be the ones that come to the closest to Paul who was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only he was free of all men meaning no man controlled him Hallelujah even in me I believe No One controls me every preacher no one should control you even the pastors you know don't say don't believe in the pastors and how the church you know yeah we believe in the pastors but the pastors do not control people by their own ideas Pastor control people by two things one the word two the Holy Spirit you see you by the Holy Spirit can lead people or you by the word can lead people but you do not lead them by your own ideas or by your own thoughts so Paul was free of all men sold out to God and gave forth the word of God only and manifested the what the Holy Ghost in power in power none else would would do none else would do you have to work from the original as like begins like the true church will always be the one that tries to follow in the steps of our Founders at pente and our Messengers will follow the Apostle Paul the first messenger the first church age it is it is that simple and that wonderful Hallelujah now I'd like us to see the KE that brother used okay all right sister Joan are you here I see I think she's not here because of network uh okay she might be streaming on on YouTube I think her network was bad uh sister sah I do not know if your network is good enough for you to read for us one portion there do you think it's good enough for you to read for us a portion let us try to un see if it will work there you are you are unmuted can you continue from there am I clear yes you are clear you can continue are with this key so simple yet so wonderful I was able by the help of the Holy Spirit to read the book of Revelation and the histories and find there in each age each messenger the each and the part to the of those ages Hallelujah all right now okay as you pause a little bit there sister brother Char can you please if you are if you can hear me can you explain to us exactly because now just says with this key okay he explains with this key but we do not know well of course we have already G through but someone may not even have understood what is the key that used to come to uh to come to this to determine the uh the church age messenger each messenger of each Church age to determine the direction of each age to determine all these things what the key that he use brother if you would like to take it up from there and explain a little bit for the for the people here as well yes okay to you yeah God bless you brother I'm very sorry hello God bless you I would like to say I'm not in a in in in a position to answer the question okay do you have yes I have it right at hand but I was somewhere I was not really in the point when we were reading okay yes okay but have have you been following so far yes from the previous paragraph I was there following up and then I was just maybe the Holy Spirit wants to you to get something that you missed and then there that's why he called you so can we have someone brother brother Isaac you would like to do that okay who would like to explain to brother the uses here who ready you brother you no don't don't fear whatever there's no wrong answer here okay you have an idea about it okay can you please put brother uh the brother on the screen okay we shall have a brother here and he will be able to take it up okay might want to use a bit bigger voice explain how say PA say that was not in authority of any man was led by the spirit and by the word yes so he said that to get other other other Messengers every age he used to study BS hisory yes sh and then he used used to identify those ones who are close how PA was how the signs and W that those signs and wonders he used yes and that's how he was able toidentify the Revelation in each in each Church identify the situation during that time idy that so but there is a key a specific key that he uses the key was that the standard was God Bless you that's what I was looking for stand at we have already gone through for almost 1 hour more than one hour that was the standard that's was the key go ahead stand the of the world yes and then the Manifest yes yes amen God bless all of you Hallelujah so we see that what happens at Pentecost the purity of the word the signs and wonders the manifestation of the Holy Ghost and the true Messengers were right in there believing that manifesting that and so that's the key that goes throughout the church ages so we are able to know which age we are living in the message of that age what church It Is by seeing what God did at Pentecost are they close to what was at Pentecost even we able to know the church I am in is it true or not trying to B on is it doing what was done at Pentecost are you following yes that is the key that we use that is how we able to know yes the the True Church of Jesus Christ and we able to track it from the beginning until today are you understanding amen so right now let us I I wanted to push it until to some point but um I do not know let us see okay uh let's let's do a few more minutes since you now understand how we judge what the true church was like what she was at Pentecost and what she was in the apostolic age as set forth in the word in the book of Acts we can now apply the same rule to show us how the church failed the basic error or errors that creped into the first church and were revealed in the book of Acts and Revelation and also in the Epistles will become more and more visibly manifested in each subsequent age until we come to a complete black out of Truth in the last age which is the age now can I have a sister read from that next paragraph all right quickly assister that will okay yeah that's you try to make your voice a bit louder for people to be able to hear you now comes another slight wonderful truth say that the true church always try to like it in the book ofs that is exactly but we we have discovered that the word also tees eror is truth yes the question arises in our minds does God forsake his own and let them fall into state of complete deception does he does he no sister for says very clearly in Matthew 24 canot be deed for there shall rise false christs and false prophets and shall two great and wonders in so much that it possible shall receive very Hallelujah now can the El be deceived this another Point can just skip can the be deceived did you know that people are preaching this that even the El will be deceived by the false Christ the El deceived because whates the scure say m44 for Matthew 24:24 loud loud that it possible they shall deceive the very can that if so is it Hallelujah so the word if there it shows you the impossibility of it the the false Christ by the way when he say false Christ does mean false Jesus is only meaning false anointed what does the word Christ mean the anointed the anointed one so we not talking about the man Jesus we're talking about many people coming in the name of I'm anointed I can touch you and you can fall down I can do this I can shout and then something happens I can blow on you the man does like this on you you fall you know it's an anointing right yes but the anointing is not wrong but the man is wrong ration Reve To Us by the message the anointing is not wrong but the man himself is wrong so he is false but he is Anointed so they are false anointed one take to H because of them being false they don't have the word but they can only manifest the anointing so that's why the B talks about those false and the false prophets they will show Great Signs they will show way so Miracles but when they false prophets and wonders so if it were possible why would it be almost possible to deceive the because these Miracles will be real whereby the will see and say this is the way I see the true church of Pentecost and if it is by the grace of God they also can be deceived but we God they can be deceived A Hallelujah am that's the only thing that comforts me to know that I can never be deceived I can never be deceived hallelujah oh Hallelujah people in our generation are running after miracles signs and wonders but the Bride of Jesus Christ is running after is running after God bless you amen the true church is rning after the pure word of God that is what we are running after the can come and join follow us in Mark 16 what does it say and the signs shall do what I it will follow these Believers will follow these signs are you sure your in your Bible please be sure because you know you may believe something that please confirm Mark 16 you must know where these things are because you can be deceived easily Mark 16 verse [Music] 15 not shall be DED and he said that to them [Applause] [Music] okay Hallelujah and Believers will follow [Music] thank you for being very those on who are who are following Miracles they are not Believers those who believe the Miracles the signs the word they shall follow Hallelujah we the word we live a life of of of Christ yes then the miracles must follow the signs and wers must follow a whole life must follow and these things must follow understand because we are believer right and then and then someone asks me here a question sister please does God forsake his own and let them fall into a state of complete deception the answer is no God can never forsake you to make you fall to let you fall into complete deception never it can never happen as long as you are an elect but if you make a choice to be deceived here is what will happen to you I I think I cannot answer this question satisfactory without also saying this right if you forsake the truth and you refuse having receive the truth and you refuse to believe it here is what happens for you you will be Hallelujah God will give you another spirit this time it will not even be the Holy Ghost anymore if you refuse to believe the truth let me show you after you have received the truth here is what happens uhhuh second Thessalonians 2 quickly Now quickly now yes chapter 2 vers read verse sity what is Iniquity iniquity is knowing the truth and refus to believe continue only he he now let he be taken out of the way uhhuh and then shall the wicked be revealed uhhuh whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth M and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming the brightness of his coming continue even him who Who coming is after the working of Satan uhhuh with all power with all power and SS and SS and L wonders uhhuh and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness uhhuh in them that perish uhhuh because they received not the love of the truth uhhuh that they be and for for this cause God shall send them strong why are they going to perish because theyed not the love of please read your Bible because they receive of the truth that they might be saved so for this ca for this reason my good Lord God now will send them stronger delusion delusion to believe a lie continue that they all might be D who believe not the truth but had pleasure in un they will be damed they will be condemned they will be judged because they did not have love of the oh somebody help John because they never had love of the truth they knew the truth but they not it as the truth so therefore they will be judged they will be condemned they will go to hell why because they did not receive it as the truth they had pleasure in unrighteousness they love the world more than the word they esteemed the lust of the eyes the pride of life the L of the flesh rather than the word of God therefore God will now say okay you have refused the Holy Spirit don't worry I am going to give you another spirit and what kind of he give them the spirit ofion theion is not going to be very small small going to be so big that even if they want to run away they canot run away it is going to be so strong that it will capture them whereby even if you preach to them 20 times of the word they will never accept it even if you bring Angel Mich himself to preach they will never evenus himself comes from heaven or someone who died long time ago like Lu comes will never accept it why because because two reasons why they have re the of delusion because they refuse the truth when the truth was presented to them so child when you hear the truth now do not what your please I'm begging you do not in your heart when you hear something in this Bible study and it crushes your heart and you realize oh I'm wrong please soften your heart oh God forgive me I'll let go of that just move on move on if something is wrong with your life and oh I didn't know that oh I'm not even baptized oh just everything that is wrong you know or else you know you can easily end up in the wrong place oh God help us can we continue so we can find a place to stop who was reading was it me okay who can I pick Sister Sister Alinda do you have your church book there can you read this one is not not uh like like most of you she's I don't know if she is running up with and a baby or she's having a book so if you have your book I would like you to read if you don't then I can have sister P right here sister P if your network is stable to the exent that you can read for us I'm happy if you can read that remaining part for us okay let's check our sister piece okay can you start video okay somehow I can't see this video and I can't hear her but she tried to unmute can you hear me okay your video is off okay can you read can you read even if your video is off what paragraph are we going to what oh really it says what then the answer is Cle before us do you have that before you can you read is that clear for you no no that's we can hear but not very very [Music] clear is Hallelujah this is how it has been this is how it is now and this is how it will be the false Vine tries to kill the True Vine claiming that they are wrong here in Uganda we had a man who killed he was Roman Catholic and then he converted to being something he was say that his name is and he killed very many people by burning them so since that time whenever you are small small and you preaching the truth they call you they these are the because they don't have big churches like them because for them they have big churches they can be seen on a mountain and everything they say oh we the right ones and these small small ones are the wrong ones who told you the right ones have always been the small small ones and the big ones have always been the wrong ones if you search your Bible the Bible says the way that goes to heaven is what and narrow and straight is the way that leads to come on know your and he says There Will Be Few that will find it few that will few that will find it very few that will find it but the to H is and many shall find so which way do you want to go I'm going to close it here but I want to give you a small story or testimony as I close one day I was in Ethiopia and we were driving I was the one driving and uh I reached a place we are going to a tall you know tall station and I was with a brother so I I told him which lane should I take you know there are many lanes like four LAN three so he said you should take this one which has many people I was like many cars I was like but this one has many cars which means it might be Str in front that was my reasoning and his reasoning was like no because many car it means the one which is right the one this which has no you should not take it I like okay let us go so I took the with the one of many CS so we went slowly slow so when we reach in front we realize the other L which had no car was free but everyone was taking the one with many think is good and they were all close close to one another by the time you got you escape so we were all going blindly because others were going in the same L you realize that is how the world is where not never do that amen follow or go a certain direction take a certain way simply because you are convinced in your heart is the right way amen pray about it if it is the wrong way God will correct you God will say to that you don't go to him but whatever you take be convinced in your heart it is the truth I believe this message because I am convinced fully it is the truth if at any time there is more truth that comes the Holy Spirit Will make sure he direct me to it but for now he directed me to this truth and I'm so glad that he found me Hallelujah you can find that song I'm so glad that he found me we have a problem with our song what happened oh there is a problem all right but the song says that I'm so glad that he found me I do not have it and I do not know it of head but it would have been very good for us to sing it and but I think we have sung it here before right how many remember it how many remember that song no one I'm so glad found okay let me try to search found okay you can't find that can we s that I'll Fly Away okay so I'd like us to sing I'll Fly Away [Music] yes yes you it and then it went I thinking I don't have it yet yeah right there okay how may know this song those who don't know it sing along [Music] slowly can you song [Music] please to your show I will fly away oh Fly Away Oh Glory I [Applause] Hallelujah oh the shadows of [Applause] his fly away fly Glory away oh before I [Applause] Hallelujah you [Applause] [Music] are Glory oh before I Hallelujah fly away oh I will fly away GL oh [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah I am we shall be on the [Music] theet oh in [Music] the Beautiful amen I just I just remembered uh I had requested brother Char to give us that testimony uh if you are fine now and you can hear me I think this would be an appropriate time before we close for you to uh give these people here that testimony of What the Lord Has Done for our brother I don't know if he's there or not but if you can be able to do that brother that would be nice are there yes God bless you how are you yes I'm also fine in the Lord and I'm happy to tell you testimony on about our brother he's not he's not necessarily our brother but he has been my friend for a long time and I have stayed with him we met some time long ago we talked about the scriptures he is the man who I had a very St St stand of denomination of which I don't know the denomination very well I met with him last I think 2019 is when we met we talked but we had no have time by then to talk then he after he graduated he went to Nairobi for some very I think he went to last year he went to Nairobi after doing some business around Western then he called me and he told me you want to come to at Western then I I told him just come and he was ready to stay in my house for just around around one week then we started sharing about this scriptures I think we continued from where we had we had stopped back 2019 then when we talked the brother was he was also very hard as he was in the beginning are you getting meell yes we here okay when we started sharing it was very hard the way he was back 2019 and then when we were talking God revealed to him in fact we talked and he was very I told him I pray the Living God will reveal to reveal to you the truth of what I'm saying then when I said that he told me I had some change happening in his soul immediately and then he started saying oh actually you're the one who's right the scriptures are okay then all of the sudden the Holy Spirit came down and um revealed to him something he had done in in his life are you getting yes so when he accepted the what I'm saying it is of God and the truth all of the sudden the Holy Spirit came down and revealed to him something he had done previously in his life then when that thing was revealed to him he was very anxious and said I should believe this I should believe what you telling me then I told him I'm ready any time you say you want for the bapm of baptism in the water I'm ready to take you then he told me now what can me if I've already believed that means heaven will rise up tomorrow I mean tomorrow in the morning we go to the water you baptize me then I told him it's okay then that morning we we did it that is the case of that brother the brother had posted yesterday about his baptism

he graduated okay okay this one 2018 yes yes but we we used to talk we used to talk about the scripture he knew my stand and he appreciated my stand in fact what has meant him to come near me he has been watching my status in WhatsApp and then one time he told me I have been seeing the way you living and I've not found I I've seen people saying they are Christians but you is more more strong than the others so I told he told me he has been watching my my status in and what I'm writing I've never deviated from from the from the Bible or anything else so I told him you can also be of the same same type I love that you can also be of the same type Hallelujah Pro then after a very short time is when now I he was by then he was at Nairobi and then he told me you want to come to Kaka where I am currently staying and I told him I will lost you then when he came to my house then we started sharing about the scriptures and then he was convinced he was convinced by the word and then he accepted to follow thisway of the Gospel bless yes now he baptized although he is not in my house now he has he is doing some business around and he can also come and sometimes he fail to come he go to another brother around the town I'm very far from the town so but I think some some of some some love him in the in the in the zoom God willing yes yes that be very wonderful that's a powerful
