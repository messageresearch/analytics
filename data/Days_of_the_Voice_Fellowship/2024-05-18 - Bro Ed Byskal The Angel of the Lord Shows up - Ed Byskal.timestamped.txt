[0:04] Hallelujah and that was the first
[0:07] time and now I tell you my dear precious
[0:12] friends that is
[0:15] where my
[0:18] understanding of
[0:20] him was anchored
[0:22] there I gained such a
[0:25] Holiness and now you're being so
[0:28] nice I will I will relate a few
[0:32] wish one that I very seldom
[0:38] tell young man are you
[0:43] listening we were riding in the
[0:47] car and he was
[0:50] driving and I was sitting on the
[0:53] passenger
[0:57] side and he had that little white C Boy
[1:00] hat
[1:01] on kind of put it back he said brother
[1:05] Eddie what do you think of this
[1:08] ministry do you think it could be that
[1:10] of Elijah the prophet as it's foretold
[1:13] in the scripture and on down and then he
[1:15] went to Revelation and then his voice
[1:18] just trailed off and I had listened to
[1:21] tapes some of the old real tapes and I
[1:24] heard that when he was
[1:26] under uh a real heavy anointing
[1:31] very heavy in
[1:33] visions and I I would hear him say
[1:36] uh-huh uh-huh uh you come from a certain
[1:40] place you come from the East uhhuh
[1:43] uh-huh and your daughter wrote you a
[1:45] letter uh and the letters in your purse
[1:49] his voice would just Trail off and
[1:51] that's I had observed that you've seen
[1:55] and heard that now I hear his voice just
[1:58] Trail off do you believe this could be
[2:00] that of Elijah the prophet as is
[2:03] foretold in the scripture and then his
[2:05] voice began to Trail off and then the
[2:07] last word I heard was
[2:10] Revelation I felt
[2:13] completely completely
[2:16] incapable I felt that I was not to
[2:20] answer this kind of a
[2:22] question you brothers are listening very
[2:25] intently and I trust this will mean
[2:27] something to
[2:28] you and I I looked down at the glove
[2:32] box and I said well brother
[2:35] brandham for all I
[2:37] know it must
[2:40] be because it has every appearance of
[2:44] being and I kind of looked at him
[2:47] sideways and he put his head back we bit
[2:51] like
[2:52] this said often kind of
[2:55] wondered I kind of think so
[2:57] myself and at that instant at that
[3:00] instant
[3:02] just you talk about a wind you talk
[3:05] about a force nothing you could feel
[3:08] there was nothing you could feel there
[3:10] was nothing physical you could feel but
[3:13] there was a person there was a being
[3:15] that sat between he and
[3:17] I and he was just forward a wee bit just
[3:21] towards the dash I could actually tell
[3:24] you exactly how it was and I thought I
[3:28] thought if I breathe in or
[3:32] exhale I'm going into some other place
[3:36] I'm going to die I'm going into another
[3:40] another world if I
[3:43] breathe and I didn't want to move I was
[3:49] frozen I'm talking to you about
[3:53] him I'm talking to you about the
[3:56] Holiness of this one we call a pillar of
[3:59] Fire
[4:01] and I looked I just looked I cast my
[4:05] eyes sideways because I was afraid to
[4:07] move my head I cast my eyes sideways and
[4:10] looked at him and brother Brandon's
[4:13] beard we had about four days of beard
[4:16] and I know that when a person is under
[4:18] extreme trauma their beard will stick
[4:21] out prickly and his beard was prickly
[4:25] sticking out on his
[4:27] face and I saw his color had drained
[4:31] from his face and I thought he looks
[4:35] like he's near
[4:37] death brother Brandon rolled his head
[4:40] back slowly
[4:42] slowly just over to the side the eyes
[4:45] were the same as they were when I was on
[4:47] the
[4:52] log he looked at me he said brother
[4:55] Eddie and I was just thinking he looks
[4:58] like he's near death he said brother
[5:01] Eddie I guess he's come to me 10,000
[5:04] times
[5:05] 10,000 and that's just every time like I
[5:08] could
[5:10] die and just at that moment I had been
[5:13] hunting for Moose for meat large animal
[5:16] I stand about 2 meters at the
[5:19] shoulders and brother Brandon was
[5:21] driving and he was just we're going
[5:23] around on the gravel Highway going
[5:26] around this curve and there's this large
[5:28] animal standing in the middle of the
[5:30] road and it shocked me I said oh oh
[5:33] brother brandom there's a moose I said
[5:36] you know it just stop I'll get him and
[5:40] his voice is still slow and thick and he
[5:43] says it's it's it's all right brother
[5:45] Eddie it's all right just get your gun
[5:48] and your shells I had my gun in my hand
[5:51] he said just get your gun and your
[5:53] shells it's all right and he just kept
[5:55] driving the same speed I said stop
[5:58] brother Brom I'll get him now we're just
[6:00] maybe a 100 m or less and he said it's
[6:05] all right he said something like it's
[6:06] yours he's yours he said just have your
[6:10] gun and he drove up the closest I've
[6:13] ever
[6:14] been to a wild
[6:17] animal about 90
[6:21] M and
[6:23] stops and I get out and I have a scope
[6:27] on my rifle and I'm looking through the
[6:29] scope and all I see is hair I can't even
[6:33] see the animal and I have to lift the
[6:36] gun up to the sky and see the hump and
[6:39] the animal and bring it down it's the
[6:42] only time in my life I had that
[6:44] experience and I pulled the trigger and
[6:47] I saw the bullet actually now some of
[6:49] you people may not like this but this we
[6:51] live on meat and and the bullet just
[6:53] entered in and poof and then I thought
[6:56] oh I don't want him to stop I don't want
[6:59] him to stop on the highway someone will
[7:01] come over the hill and hit him and we'll
[7:04] have an accident I I thought and then
[7:07] there a wide area maybe like from here
[7:10] to the wall That's all clear just grass
[7:13] and then trees starting there and I
[7:15] thought I don't want him to fall there
[7:17] some we don't have room and somebody
[7:19] will come and steal him and take all
[7:21] this meat maybe five six 700 lbs of meat
[7:25] a large animal and and I needed that
[7:28] animal for food food for my family and
[7:31] and and the Moose he just walked down
[7:34] stepped off the highway and he started
[7:37] to walk slowly slowly and I know he's
[7:40] not going to go very far and I don't
[7:43] want him I need him hid because I don't
[7:46] need him out in this grass somebody will
[7:48] steal him and he walks into the trees
[7:50] and just as he walks into the trees I
[7:52] fire another shot another young brother
[7:54] was traveling with us catching a ride he
[7:56] fired a shot and a moose stepped over
[7:59] two big logs two big logs and was
[8:03] completely hidden and fell right there
[8:05] you say would God do that
[8:08] absolutely my father would do that and
[8:12] completely hid that animal and we
[8:15] dressed we dressed the animal and God's
[8:19] Prophet sat on a tree right beside us
[8:22] and he watched me and the other young
[8:23] man and we dressed this animal got it
[8:27] all ready got it dressed we finished
[8:30] wiped our
[8:32] knives walked back to the car brother
[8:34] Brown walked with
[8:36] me we got in a car he sat in his seat
[8:40] and I
[8:43] sat friends I'm not given over to
[8:46] special
[8:47] things but I was surrounded in an
[8:53] atmosphere it was it was so
[8:57] Divine it even had a color it was like
[9:01] emerald
[9:03] green there was nothing my eyes were
[9:05] registering I said this is the most
[9:07] beautiful
[9:09] place I thought oh
[9:11] God I'd like to just live here
[9:15] forever and the prophet laid his head
[9:19] back looked at me he said brother
[9:22] Eddie every time he comes something good
