[0:05] and he gave some apostles and prophets
[0:08] and some evangelists
[0:11] and some pastors and teachers
[0:28] to you as a gift
[0:31] i want to say
[0:33] accept the gift kid
[0:36] accept all that god has for you
[0:41] amen let's continue reading verse 12
[0:44] why did these ministers come
[0:48] for the perfecting of the saints for the
[0:50] work of the ministry for the edifying of
[0:54] the body of christ
[1:03] [Music]
[1:52] because ministry is not supposed to
[1:54] preach against people
[1:59] ministry should not uh speak against a
[2:01] circumstance or uh something that's
[2:03] happening in the church
[2:43] [Music]
[3:13] and of the knowledge of the son of god
[3:15] unto
[3:38] [Music]
[3:41] have you ever made a mistake
[3:46] the problem is when you ask a minister
[3:47] if he makes a mistake
[3:52] in his personal life
[3:55] you notice how hard he'll get
[3:57] hard how hard he will get
[3:59] oh it is
[4:02] i'm going to tell you what
[4:04] that minister is dealing with or any of
[4:05] you are dealing with
[4:07] what you're dealing with
[4:09] any minister that is like that or a
[4:11] person that is like that where they
[4:13] harden their hearts
[4:21] they have pride
[4:25] how many want to be proud foreign
[4:29] [Music]
[4:40] i'm
[4:53] when you've received great revelation
[4:59] i mean i have your seats
[5:02] so this morning we want to speak on our
[5:04] christ centered absolutely
[5:22] question
[5:24] write it down
[5:27] and come talk to me afterwards
[5:30] so what i took from that under that
[5:32] ministry
[5:34] was that it's important to take notes
[6:00] do you want your children to have the
[6:01] life of jesus christ in them granada
[6:18] a living
[7:37] [Music]
[7:41] lifted up his message
[8:10] you cannot understand
[8:36] the imbalance is when we make this
[8:38] greater than the bible
[8:43] [Music]
[8:44] if you're taking notes
[8:48] this message that i'm going to preach
[8:51] came from 1962.
[8:53] [Music]
[8:57] 12 30 a.m
[8:58] [Music]
[9:04] and it was called the absolutely
[9:23] what's the five things denominations are
[9:25] preaching about right now
[9:30] brother tim anders has never gotten a
[9:32] message from the google uganda team andy
[9:34] stage
[9:45] [Applause]
[9:46] the only thing i need to read as a true
[9:48] minister
[10:30] god
[11:12] if a person
[11:25] ministry today the bride ministry
[11:29] should only be preaching
[11:32] the third pool
[11:36] for the timothy brothers
[11:39] when we preach the third pool
[11:43] will we have a big congregation
[11:47] never
[11:48] okay never again
[11:53] because what we have in the message of
[11:55] the hour
[11:58] people that preach the first pool and
[12:00] second point
[12:04] they want someone to come lay their
[12:05] hands on them and shout hallelujah
[13:02] see we have an hour we had an hour and a
[13:04] half of
[13:46] and today
[14:13] [Music]
[14:14] the
[14:28] and we preach the
[14:36] is not going to churches that are having
[14:38] hundreds of baptisms
[14:43] i'm not going to churches this is a
[14:45] citadel mechanism that are having
[14:48] hundreds of people baptized
[14:53] now listen very carefully
[14:55] baptism is an important
[15:36] and i said where are the people you
[15:37] baptized
[15:42] most of those people
[15:45] don't even have a bible
[15:47] and most of those same people
[15:51] do not read the message
[16:04] we're having this huge sweeping revival
[16:06] in uganda
[16:11] then why are there only 50 people here
[16:16] do you understand what i'm saying
[16:18] i'm not trying to attack anybody sitting
[16:34] they want to
[16:50] and that's to give all glory to jesus
[16:52] christ amen
[16:55] amen
[16:56] hallelujah
[16:58] just like a brother timothy could stand
[16:59] here
[17:01] when it seems brother bus is lifting him
[17:03] up
[17:07] brother is not lifting up him he's
[17:09] lifting up
[17:10] in timothy
[17:13] we're lifting up jesus in the brothers
[17:30] is
[17:42] if we compromise on the word of god
[17:57] only the true believer will stay
[18:40] this brother gave a testimony that god
[18:41] provided a job
[18:47] what if this brother though in his hour
[18:49] of need
[18:52] had texted me and 15
[19:04] then he would have replaced
[19:06] jehovah jireh oh yeah
[19:21] is
[19:34] god gave him a greater job
[20:04] you need to stop
[20:21] i'm discerning spirits in africa
[20:27] a god called pastor
[20:31] must be set by god
[21:55] if you're cheating on your wife
[22:11] someone already knows
[22:14] money
[22:16] somebody already knows
[22:18] money someone already knows you
[22:20] committed adults
[22:24] he knows
[22:37] has been seared
[23:56] [Music]
[24:44] brothers
[25:38] but have somewhere that you go to
[25:53] somewhere you support the
[26:05] but don't never
[26:07] disfellowship
[27:46] that
[28:26] that is causing disunity in
[29:05] [Music]
[29:11] what do i need to do brother jim if i
[29:12] have hey
[29:15] repent
[29:16] tiffany
[29:18] it's done winning it when you repent
[29:23] but you might have to email them
[29:38] and when that
[30:33] and see if he has the same purpose in
[30:35] his heart
[30:41] you got fellowship
[30:44] one with another when when we're not
[30:47] when when will you have that fellowship
[30:51] when you discern his spirit
[30:58] when brother tim sits over here and i
[31:00] listen to a minister
[31:02] when brother tim sits over there oh look
[31:04] on that team but nevertheless and i
[31:06] listened to a minister
[31:09] or anywhere in the church
[31:16] i
[31:17] it i'm looking at his spirit
[31:21] i'm looking at what his motive and
[31:23] objective
[31:31] brother bus oh foreign gosh
[31:32] on the bus not because i think he has a
[31:34] great ministry
[31:37] not because i think he's a special man
[31:42] i came because the spirit in me is the
[31:43] same
[31:57] has been crucified by people
[33:40] i want you to be thinking about your
[33:41] pastor right now
[33:45] your pastor is not here right
[33:50] you all know
[34:32] 104.
[34:34] and bring it back
[34:44] he should be able to bring an argument
[34:45] back into sweetness
[34:56] he knows how to take care of things
[35:14] if they
[35:25] did you know that there is a big
[35:27] movement in the message of the hour oh
[35:28] she might
[36:23] if you receive tithes
[36:27] from people that don't go to your church
[36:32] you're a hypocrite
[36:36] do you understand what you're talking
[36:37] about ties are supposed to go as brother
[36:39] branham said
[36:41] to the local minister
[36:45] to the local church that you go
[36:51] you know what's happening right now
[37:20] what
[37:47] never changed when they started
[37:48] streaming
[37:49] [Music]
[38:03] service instead of two on saturday
[38:08] do you understand what's going on
[38:10] hypocrite
[38:13] liars
[38:14] taking the word of god and taking
[38:16] advantage of it
[38:19] brother and sister in the message
[38:22] i hope you're not serving the message
[38:24] for blessings
[38:27] brother tim does not serve jesus christ
[38:30] to be blessed
[38:44] the
[38:57] you desire to do good
[39:11] you must be given to hospital
[39:27] why do people believe it they can just
[39:29] drink wine
[39:35] you just disqualified yourself
[39:47] [Music]
[40:07] and you know what i'm lowering myself to
[40:08] oh my gosh
[40:11] [Applause]
[40:13] you say your bride
[40:16] but you live like the church
[40:19] how can you be bribed
[40:48] don't stop translating the message
[41:00] not every message is in your language
[41:03] right now uh we're talking about
[41:34] you can translate the message
[41:41] oh and all the brothers didn't like that
[41:45] go and look at thursday night at
[41:47] cloverdale by the way
[41:54] makes an announcement
[41:56] that a chinese sister
[42:00] is translating the service
[42:05] and he says something very profound
[42:09] you can do that
[42:11] so where in the message do we get it
[42:13] that men can only translate
[42:28] a lady is greater than a man
[42:31] my prophet said my wife is greater than
[42:33] me
[42:37] my wife
[42:39] is who i am
[42:42] if you
[43:09] you want harmony in your home
[43:11] if you want harmony in your life
[43:13] why don't you just try right
[43:16] saying
[43:18] sit down
[43:20] here's some ice cream
[43:23] you relax and i'll wash
[43:30] [Music]
[43:37] this is a hard
[43:38] thing
[43:40] but it's nothing but the truth
[43:43] you know how i can say that
[43:45] because the prophet for our day did the
[43:47] same thing
[43:48] yet
[44:45] people have asked the question how long
[44:47] should a sister wear a skirt um
[45:08] [Applause]
[45:23] but i saw the pastor's wife wearing
[45:25] tight skirts
[45:27] i saw the pastor's wife with a big split
[45:30] what
[45:43] yourself with a man
[46:12] i don't
[46:54] his
[47:33] can you please raise your hand someone
[47:34] in here that has never had a
[47:35] disagreement or argument
[48:02] it made a person seem like they were
[48:04] perfect
[48:18] use that
[48:29] [Applause]
[48:58] i know i just heard more sisters saying
[49:00] man than brother
[49:03] [Applause]
[49:29] [Music]
[50:23] when i read the messages
[51:19] [Music]
[51:34] you should be able to meet any person on
[51:36] this world
[51:39] god bless you
[51:44] how are you
[51:46] how have you been
[51:48] how is your family
[51:52] [Music]
[52:11] [Music]
[52:16] they accused
[52:26] [Music]
[52:44] the longer you're in the message
[52:48] the greater chance an entitlement spirit
[52:51] can rise
[52:54] yes entitlement spirit you're entitled
[52:58] as the only group okay
[53:06] the men that make themselves special
[53:11] are a denominational
[53:27] and he can do nothing wrong
[53:30] i'm sorry
[53:32] you're following a man
[53:36] i was in many churches as i said
[54:07] he was not your husband
[54:51] do you know why the rapture hasn't
[54:52] happened yet
[54:55] to test you ah
[54:58] if you'll continue loving jesus
[55:01] you know why the rapture didn't happen
[55:02] in 1977

[56:12] mommy
