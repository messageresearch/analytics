Marching In oh Lord I want to be that number and when the sins Go Marching In oh I wanted to see my savior oh if my life is free from [Music] the clouds [Music] [Music] oh Lord I want [Music] oh Jesus is [Music] Hallelujah I shall not be I shall not be moved just [Music] [Music] never I shall not be moved he will fail me there I shall not be moved just like a dream [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I shall not be Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Music] I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be I shall not be moved like a tree that's planted by the world [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] help us to stand tonight [Music] maybe someone who is very disappointed or downcast that he just come and revive their strength just give us strength in Jesus name amen amen God bless you why don't we check our Bibles I want to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus how many are happy to be in the house of the Lord amen Amina we are taking Isaiah 40. today is and we are reading verse from verses 31 actually yesterday in verse 31 . everybody there [Music] let us begin from verse 30. even the youth shall faint and be wary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not faint Ed foreign foreign [Music] [Music] if you look at verse 29 he says he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength foreign foreign I'm seeing different ones we prefer back seats you know on Wednesday when people are not more it's better we come and take the front seats that everybody is close and we are compacted together foreign I want to speak on today is waiting um yes what about when I say wait wait Linda yeah you know he knows too much luganda so he expounds it sometimes wait Linda SO waiting Linda waiting okay yes I think that's the word what does it say but they that wait upon the Lord it is the present continuous okay okay sister Grace amen all right but the day that you wait upon the Lord I'm happy to see brothers and uh also brother Gideon God bless you thank you for coming and I'm happy to see every one of you themselves these young men they've not been coming on Wednesday for some time but the day that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint Ness [Music] but even the youth shall faint sometimes we think you know when people are older sometimes they can lose balance and fall off all and that's what happens the older ones the older you get the more vulnerable you are but you see even the Bible says even the young even the youths and even the youth be wary and even the younger men shall utterly fall nobody is meaning that to each of us whether you are old or young you are not sufficient in yourself that you need an extra help you need God to give you strength and Grace sometimes you might be wary it is Spirit or in your soul or in your body and you need extra strength and you feel you need strength from the Lord may be your friend and the Bible says that but you see if they that wait upon the Lord [Music] as long as we wait upon the Lord we will always renew our strength now there are many benefits of waiting room one thing to note however is waiting is never fun see the longer you wait the stronger the feeling of being a loser is the longer you wait the worse you feel how many have ever waited all right so all of you have stood in a line or in a queue and you waited for something what were you waiting for food someone was waiting for food and you know when you are hungry and you're standing in a queue you you can't pass the others that came before you even if you have answers and you you begin complaining around I have outside I'm actually feeling not well at all at least they should have let me pass if you try to pass somebody else will tell you please please and especially when here in Africa when someone has died many people who don't don't even have an association with the person who died they want to come and eat food [Music] and they are usually the first in the queue when even when they are last or in the middle somewhere they will try to sneak their way out of the queue so that they can be in the front because they don't want to wait they know somebody can eye them and maybe chase them away in the bank and maybe there are those tellers that really serve slowly slowly slowly 10 minutes sometimes even one hour and you feel like fainting I remember when I was in Ethiopia Ethiopia my my wife I think we had about two children then those um and so we had Elizabeth and the ship I don't know where they're here so Elizabeth was very good at crying so when we would stand at um at the immigration queue immigration it was a very long queue but you know what I used to do yes I remember that time at that time my wife was pregnant for uh foreign [Music] and at that moment I knew indeed waiting we were not going to wait no more foreign [Music] [Music] nobody likes waiting if you want something you want it immediately if you ask if you're a child and you ask your parents for money and you're going to school you want it there and then [Music] if you want a job you want it now if you want a husband or a wife you want her or him now whatever you you want you want it now so thus waiting is not a good thing for most of us and the longer you wait the the worse you feel but if you read in the Bible and you look at history or even Bible History every person of substance waited Everest person there was a person of substance they waited nobody received what they wanted to receive there an event they waited and I'm going to take you down a journey tonight we will not be long as usual I consider myself not to be a very long preacher the network and so I trust that you will follow me along tonight let us begin with a quote but the banham says but it was done the Hebrew children but they never tempt the Lord thy God they was just thrown into it they didn't try to manufacture something and he says that's what's the matter with the Pentecostals today they are manufacturing something into they can't wait you see they are manufacturing something they can't wait and he says oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery tell us to manufacture something never uses stairs and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait I will get deep into he says the first bride could not wait that is talking about Eve could not wait and because she could not wait she went into adultery again and then she was able to get bastard children and he says we all are a part of that okay I'll expound it as we go on but God came in the flesh but God Came In the Flesh to give us another bus God Came In the Flesh to bring us back to the original Sons and Daughters of God you see he says that um okay the lifespan of Eve never happened it never did why she mingled it kept it away instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ's will would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it I mean did you get it no you see Adam Adam was the husband to this bride yes and he was supposed to give seeds you remember what God promised Adam in the beginning in Genesis what did God promise them God tell them he told them multiply and remember by this time Adam and Eve was not flesh and blood how are they going to accomplish that just the same way but God brought forth his children by the spoken word because the spoken word is the original but what happened while they waited already in that for the appointed time I can say that cartoon because someone told me oh if that was the purpose why didn't they have children before [Music] but you see that had not yet been the appointed time because before the appointed time for that to be accomplished and the serpent gave a better options and then see what came through bastard children do you know that we all are born as bastard children [Music] it doesn't matter how your parents were before they gave birth to you since you were born according to the last of the flesh the Bible says we were born in sins we come to the word speaking lies that is why we still have these Desires in us the Bible calls it the pride of life the last of the Flesh and the last of the eyes each human being has that it is a part because each of you has that part of serpency [Music] and that is the flesh because the flesh is this is not the image of God some person was saying oh you know I'm in the image of God the image of God is not this dying flesh of God God because he's born into your nature when you hear the word of God and believe it and then you receive the holy ghost that is the image of God right there in your soul but you see the way we were born we were all born needing to be safe we were all born with that part of the world the reason was the first bride did not wait the Bride of Adam did not wait you see so she did not bring the original Sons and Daughters of God [Music] bastard children but here he says but God Came In the Flesh you give us another bar at work to bring us back to the original Sons and Daughters of God to come here hallelujah amen and that's why I said no matter how evil we are or how bad we are traveling you see as a child of God you must never accept to defeat foreign foreign foreign this brought bastards into the world as a result like I said we all are bastards by nature but our souls do you understand that your soul the inside of you the man within the man within the man but the spirit souls in God before the foundation of the world that soul in me in you in us all the children of God in God before the foundation of the world but now when we we were born in the flesh so we found talking of our souls we found ourselves as a victim of circumstances so we found ourselves chained Praise In Chains of sins we found ourselves you know in Prison Press you see that's why we preached that's why there is preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the gospel songs free setting the captives [Applause] actually he says that the spirit of the Lord God is upon me the purpose of Jesus Christ was on Earth so our soul that we are a victim of circumstances you see he made an unfailing way for those Souls that were in prison an unfailing way for them to be set free 30 minutes and how does it set them free by giving them a new bath by giving you a new you may not someone may tell you against this message but we are the proof that what I'm telling you is the truth that God can still set Souls free do you believe you are one of those Souls that are set free the name of the Lord something is happening today with you know young people that wouldn't wait just a little bit all right so we see that some you know uh they end up you know because physically speaking now they end up they can't wait you know waiting for marriage waiting or you're waiting waiting or they can't wait and so they end up in fornication and immorality but remember failing to wait like Eve's case has consequences the devil would love to give us a quick way out and then after that he leaves you to eat when it comes to the consequences when you are walking in sin and in the Journey of not waiting [Music] you are walking there with the Devil foreign but when the consequences when the time for the consequences has come now the devil runs away leaves you alone in your Constitution friends I'd like us to see an example here that did not wait turn with me to the book of First Samuel foreign okay look at verse five let us begin from verse five somewhere so so and the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with Israel 30 000 chariots and six thousand Horsemen and people as the sandwiches on the seashore in multitude and they came up and pitched in mishmash Eastward from Beethoven when the men of Israel saw that they were in a straight for the people were distressed then the people did die themselves in caves and thickets and in rocks and in high places and in pits ourselves and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of God and Gilead as for Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling is and so the Philistine Army had come to attack the Israelites and you remember how Saul was chosen as a man to lead Israel of course it was at a time that Israel wanted to have a man to rule over them and yet God was their King and so God told his Prophet don't worry they have not rejected you but they have rejected me but you remember last time we talked about how Saul was elected as a king it was God that elected him and chose him to be a king I will not go in the whole story but then he became the king of Israel but now here I want us to look at souls he finds himself in a straight in a place where he needs to exercise waiting let me tell you to each of us Believers anybody took I want you to see the children of Israel were following Soul they were all fearful they were all trembling and then they went on up to gilgals and so the Bible verse 8 says and he tarried seven days according to the set time that Samuel had appointed but someone else came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him offering to me and peace offerings and he offered the bad offering and it came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of the offering of the offering the of offering the bad offering behold Samuel came and and Saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and someone said what has thou done and so said because I saw that the people were scattered from me and the thou cameest not within the days appointed and that the Philistines gathered themselves together a at mismatch thereafter said I the Philistines will come down now upon me to give God and I have not made supplication unto the Lord I forced myself thereof and offered a bad offering foreign and verse 12 says therefore said I the Philistines will come down upon me to gilgalan I have not made supplications unto the Lord I forced myself to have an offered about offering and someone said thou has done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord like God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever but now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over the over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee somewhere because foreign the children of Israeli as I told you they were all shivering and shaking [Music] and they came following their kings and soul knew very well that he was the king but he was not the prophet he was the king not the prophet but as he stood there in gilgals the prophet had told him to wait for seven days it was the work of a prophet to give or offer sacrifice [Music] amen and then we see that as as someone who tarried I'm imagining the Bible says for seven days the first day Russell people were tumbling the Philistines were coming back and you know they needed to give an offering so that they can go and fight you see this is how children of God fight their battles you you must give an offering to them that's why we come in the church to praise him to cry for him to jump to do all these things to hear the word we are giving an offering to them and so as they were they were up in gilgore whether the first day the prophet was looking I mean the King was looking around the prophet was not coming okay just wait for the second the second day the third day what was that what was the last day foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign foreign [Music] I'm smiling because I'm waiting brother why are you smiling because I'm waiting you're just moving I'm imagining this is how King's Soul was he didn't even know where to swim that was a mistake he did not wait and when they brought the offering the man gave it to himself thank you and he was tying an apron on himself and then the prophet arrived the Bible says at the moment this King could not wait long enough and then the man of God was hungry when the prophet arrived he told him what have you done because the king the prophet knew what the king did he was so Grievous to the Lord the prophet knew what the king did not know it wasn't just about the sacrifice it was also about the right anointed anointing for the office you see you may feel like you want to do something even better than your pastor sometimes but the question is I is that your right office [Music] you may feel in your home you are more knowledgeable than your father or singer that one against you are better than your mother you want to even do everything and devise everybody around but is that your right to office you always have to wait foreign what have you done a king was but uh you see on my knee I saw the people were scattered and you were not coming in today and the Philistines gathered themselves together I said who are you to say if God wants you to wait wait [Music] foreign [Music] and now you're saying I forced myself he was impatient he didn't wait long enough and the king the prophet said someone said unto so you have done foolishly you have not obeyed the command you have not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God and now the kingdom would have been with you forever but according to what you have done your kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own hammock [Music] seven is a number of completions it might seem that summer was no longer coming to fulfill his place but it was foolish for Saul to stop waiting and where are we today we are in the seventh age we are in the last day we are the last day of waiting the very last time I seem as if Christ is not going to come Christian but he told us he is going to come back again we are not going to be like those who don't believe let's pray we don't want to be impatient we don't want to live as though Jesus is not coming back we want to live as though we believe that on the last day on the last day of the seventh gentle generation there was the first age that was the second age that God was dealing with a gentle child foreign [Music] [Music] expecting Grace to abound don't allow the devil to preach to you that you will put it right tomorrow praise the name of the Lord whatever is wrong in your life whatever is wrong in our lives we should make it right right away and make ourselves ready all the time that if the Lord comes the next [Music] I tell you what some one of these days Jesus Christ is going to come in the air yes foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] for us we are saying Jesus since you were here on Earth it's not 2023. it's just one day it's just one day has just started for us we are saying two thousand years he's saying one day we are saying one day just want the meal one one day let me live in sin for just one day 24 hours I'll start it tomorrow but to God it is you have sorted not started yourself for two thousand years if 24 hours is 2000 years 24 hours one thousand years how much is one second attack you can count it and see it's a really long time so how are you going to live your life Soul as soon as he offered the sacrifice foreign [Music] are we ready to receive him it will pay off at the end of the world so we are here friends at the finishing line today let us not give up yet how I wish that somebody would have told Seoul wait just a moment the man waited for seven days actually let me say for six days and 23 hours perhaps I can put it that way and that last two hours and that's when the prophet arrives the Bible says that the day of the Lord will be as a thief in the night men will be on the sowing one will be taken once [Music] [Music] has it lost I didn't find him water [Music] oh where are you what's my first question say oh we are in conventions let me tell you this is how we ought to be going to keep always wanting to be near our brothers how can you be a believer your friends are those of the world you don't even contact with the Believers let me ask you are they the ones really that you're going to spend the time to win I want to spend most of my time with the people I will spend eternity with for money now even when I'm here I want to be close to them because I know we are going together we are going somewhere together together with them it's not just a party hallelujah amen it's a good party in heaven says there will be Rejoice amen because we will have overcome the world let me tell you our hearts should always be yearning for the coming of the lord we should always live under expectations yes we can go and have jobs yes we can go and take our families design it we can take care of our families and do other things that is secondary the primary thing for a Believer the coming of the Lord the preparation for the characters are you ready you want to take the phone and write a brother how are you my brother one of the reasons you are doing that fantasy are they still here then I say yes yes I'm pressing and they will ask you what about you you said me too I'm blessings hallelujah amen let me tell you foreign I said brother have you heard it from so-and-so no I am not feeling the burden and the fire to God preaching okay we should go and pray but before we do that let us go and talk to the pastor and then when you go to the pasta you find there is a forsaken house maybe the pastor has gone somewhere with his family let us go on Sunday at church and tell the Believers you will find one or two people and the deacons will not be there the minutes and then those of you who find yourself you'll realize you have one thing in common come to think of it we are the others what happened and then one of you will think about it before you tell the others all right before you even want to say you will cry three years but in the wrong place [Music] [Applause] yes some people will be shouting solo pain crying because they are left behind but those who will go and brother those of you who remain you will add a pattern to preach the foolish virgins is it you will be believer but foolish the prophet told the king it was foolish for you to have done this you know how could you not wait right those who will not wait that are in this you will be foolish for them foolish virgins while some of us have gone to glory and I tell you what I believe with all my heart I am one of those that will go [Music] Hallelujah if the devil doesn't believe it I say he can go to hell that's where he belongs but I know where I belong I belong in the Rapture I belong in the coming of the Lord so that he can give me a new birth in myself on fire for the coming of the Lord praise the name of the Lord make friends with those that you will spend eternity check your foreign foreign [Music] foreign there's even another one God has ready to prepare when did God prepare him he know that the king would do this God knows all things the next thing is the next thing waiting is for that elected and called out Seed of Abraham [Music] the infestation of God among his people and waiting narinda foreign when the saints go marching again When the Saints Go Marching be in that number help me not to be that number I am waiting for that means to my home do that fair City When the Saints Go much and then the prophet told him the king God has even prepared says that you see these people they did not wait and because they didn't wait they denominated they formed the organizations the former wife of king of assurance and so the king she would not have the life of the king the king put her away and brought him another himself another one another bride another queen another queen that would obey him that you would do his will and that was Queen Esther God has given to us the calling to be in the anointing that Queen Esther was in to be the bride in waiting we are the one that he is coming foreign [Music] [Music] okay in in 20 minutes let me let me take you through this let us see first Samuel chapter 13 verse 14 but now the kingdom shall not continue here is when God is choosing David now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him and a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee on your recommendation so here was God choosing David did David know these words were being spoken by soul to King Saul by somewhere to King Saul are you following me and the King Saul was the one who was rejected by God and God was telling him I've now chosen another one foreign yes yes he was a Shepherd somewhere in a bush he didn't know what God was planning but he was waiting waiting before he even knew the plan of God for his life you may tell me yes I don't know what I should wait for what what God intends for my life I don't know the plan of God just wait my name is you do not know anything you're going to be two years from now but wait upon the Lord David was waiting even when he did not know you were in a better place than David tonight because I have told you David no one told him David was just waiting but here I'm telling you wait ing something is fixing to happen wait upon the Lord and then came a time when a time of waiting was almost over um three chapters later in 1612. and he sent and brought him in now he was Rudy and Widow of a beautiful continents and goodly to look too and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he then someone took the Horn of all and anointed him in the midst of his Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so someone rose up and went to ramam but the spirit of the Lord departed from Saul and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him and sold servants said unto him behold now an evil spirit from God troubling I want you to see something here at this time of course we know the story how someone went to Jesse's house and when he arrived in Jesus house he was supposed to anoint a king there yeah I want to ask you another question did he know who the king was isn't this the same man that spoke to Saul and he said God has chosen another man so did he know the man he was making my inspiration that's why you should always be careful when the word of God goes through the the minister because sometimes God is designing speaking your heart without even the man himself knowing what he's talking about um a few statements it's about your life you know it's about your life but I don't know anything about even what I'm saying this is so yeah Saul was telling King uh someone was telling King Saul that God has the kingdom will no longer continue with you God has chosen himself but even so did not know and go in the house how he he followed the leadership of God he took him there what did he have to do friends but like many of us sometimes waiting is a menace foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] then again he saw another one because to me who are those little preachers for tomorrow send them over here all right come come laying up here how many times did he just have yes huh by the time will come come on and fill the whole place just as children you see how all of them how good they are told us went to the next one can you imagine she didn't wait and then all of a sudden God had somebody there praise the name of the Lord God had somebody that he had kept somewhere we are nobody knew look at that foreign good man please let's go choose from dogs I'm not saying God has not chosen you so then then but God goes no shoes I'm imagining David is a he must have looked at him like this is foreign [Music] [Music] ah hallelujah hallelujah God is saying this is God is telling me there is someone there foreign [Music] then he collects himself is the one that has been having headaches two of them said yeah the one that I saw when none of you is the one that her husband or your bowel lifter we are not married yet foreign here David God chose him and when God chose him I will not read Because of time God anointed him after and the moment God anointed him the Bible says the spirit of God David and the spirit of God and an evil spirit how I don't know but that's what the Bible says Saul was a troubled soul but that was for a purpose there are certain things that God permits to happen so that his purpose can be accomplished in some people's lives told her to have this evil spirit movie so that David can become relevant Hallelujah I mean and when David was anointed he still was like a number the evil spirit came to sorrow and then there was a need for somebody who had the spirit now the Bible says the spirit of the evil spirit um with all that bad attitude that's why I always tell people sometimes the people who have bad attitudes [Music] foreign [Applause] the evil spirited Souls called for the spirit of God in David that was not a coincidence some people are tormented in this Earth so that it can call for what is in you to give them a solution hallelujah amen let me tell you whenever I work in this world I don't know I don't believe it is a condition I believe it is how it is supposed to be secret is I always see myself as a little David you should see yourself as a little David where is I can cast it out how are you going to cast it out by the spirit of God that is in you will meet people that are depressed [Music] God is now moving foreign [Music] [Music] foreign that sun is mine anointing would double and my stomach there could be saying that Throne is that Crown is mine hallelujah hallelujah the anointing was wrong I wonder which song do you think is sung during that moment [Applause] is taking back Linda foreign [Music] [Applause] vibrations of the power of the Holy Spirit then he's just it was just filled with that anointing and he asked the question who is this uncircumcised the Philistines that can defy the kingdoms the armies of the of the living the army of Israel Israel who is he tell me spoke in a voice bigger than him King foreign [Music] who is this man because of the way you are we can see you as so much uh you know excited let's just take you to the king so when he reached the king he told the kingdom the king looked at disciples he said okay let me give you my jacket so that you can go okay so that you can go and attack okay he said this is not my size I don't want this theology I don't want these things I want to go with only one thing Jesus yes only one thing the revealed one of the earth and when he went again he killed that man but let me tell you one thing I didn't tell you David said they asked the question the first question the very first question they asked the man who will kill this guy um and they told him he's going to give him one of his daughters [Music] what was the name of Jesus daughter foreign [Music] and at that moment because he killed that man without hesitation another battle started in the palace this boy was becoming very popular and the King now knew he was a threat to his kingdom but David waited throughout the whole time David waited he was one he was so tempted he cut some piece of his clothes because the soul was not seeing somebody but David would have just said God you know I'm anointed foreign and one of the boys of David um quickly ran and brought the the the the crown yeah David was not happy with that boy I think I don't remember I think he killed him because he told him he said how can you speak how can you rejoice over the death of God is Anointed even that it's really to be um to be around some a man or a woman of God who is waiting to be around such people you have to be very careful you can lose your life you will not be blessed took David nearly 15 years from the time he was anointed some of you here are going to be millionaires Linda some of you are going to get married you have to wait you don't have to rush don't rush things to go through you want to just get it immediately people want to be rich overnight you has given you a secret that you are going to be a pastor if God revealed one of you Brothers here that you are going to be the next past of this church if he carries would I even sleep instrumentality to it here you pull that you push here let God do things from the time David was anointed he did not influence anything big or small for him to sit on that throne foreign God did everything God literally dragged him on that Throne is [Music] that's not how it is he must get um it's called job hunting it's not job hunting that gives you a job it is faith and walking into the dogs and walking into the door that God has always did not push any door open go on your knees but for leadership your severe energy oh it is gave a testament the other time and he felt a fire and he got up I don't know where they said Hallelujah and then finally the message was projector light the first time it might have been the second time it might not have been out but what am I saying teaching number when even when you come at the altar don't rush to go back wait on God remember in the convention we had some people here by the way in every service we had someone receive the power of God you see you come before [Music] is actually more and takes longer time than actually the real thing and when you wait you can never be disappointed God bless you sir [Applause] way that way wait upon the law sharing you knew
