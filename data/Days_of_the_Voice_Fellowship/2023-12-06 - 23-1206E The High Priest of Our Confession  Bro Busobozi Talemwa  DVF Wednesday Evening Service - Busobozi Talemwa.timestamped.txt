[26:51] Hebrews
[26:56] 3:1
[26:59] up to
[27:09] two wherefore holy Brethren partakers of
[27:13] the Heavenly calling consider the
[27:16] Apostle and high priest of our
[27:20] profession Christ
[27:22] Jesus who was faithful to him that
[27:26] appointed him as also Moses was faithful
[27:30] in all his
[27:39] [Music]
[27:50] [Music]
[27:56] house
[28:02] amen God bless you you may be
[28:07] seated so since this evening I'm
[28:10] speaking on priest of our
[28:16] confession
[28:19] amen now in the Old Testament there was
[28:23] a somebody known as a high
[28:26] priest
[28:30] now I know that different preachers will
[28:32] approach it different
[28:37] ways and each according to the gift that
[28:40] God has given to
[28:42] them but just this evening maybe a
[28:45] little continuation of
[28:49] Sunday uh just uh uh overcoming the
[28:53] spirit of
[28:56] discouragement and so I'm speaking on on
[28:59] the high priest of our
[29:03] confession
[29:04] amen now the Bible uh Paul writes to the
[29:10] Hebrews and he tells them consider the
[29:16] Apostle and a high priest of our
[29:21] profession did you know that Jesus
[29:23] Christ is the
[29:26] apostle the high
[29:28] priest of our
[29:31] profession you know there is no title
[29:34] you can give to anyone uh except if
[29:37] Jesus had has had it
[29:41] first you know he has had it
[29:45] all he's our pastor he's our Apostle
[29:50] he's our friend he's our father he's our
[29:55] husband he's everything you can think
[29:57] think
[29:58] of is our all in
[30:01] all how many love Jesus with all their
[30:04] hearts amen and so uh John would write
[30:08] in the Book of Revelation and he would
[30:09] say he's the first and he's the
[30:14] last and so here he then says that uh he
[30:20] he calls him the
[30:25] Apostle our apostle
[30:29] and our high
[30:31] priest of our profession as we shall see
[30:34] later on profession here means
[30:42] confession and so I was looking at the
[30:46] Old
[30:48] Testament and and the high priest had to
[30:50] be a man without any physical
[30:56] defects
[30:58] and he had to be a man with a holy with
[31:00] a holy conduct or holy in his
[31:06] conduct and and he was the overseer also
[31:10] of all the other
[31:15] priests so in in his physical
[31:19] St he had to look better than anybody
[31:24] else he had to look better his
[31:28] appearance had L
[31:31] calmly and now in his
[31:33] life he the way he conducted
[31:37] himself he had to be better than anybody
[31:41] else and also he had to be
[31:44] holy you can find that in Leviticus
[31:47] 21 and then we see that also he was the
[31:50] over like the overseer of all the other
[31:55] priests this high priest also is a man
[31:58] that wore the
[32:03] U the on his
[32:08] breastplate brother bam speaks of
[32:13] the and he says that this is the only
[32:15] thing that was able to tell whether
[32:18] someone whether people with gifts were
[32:20] telling the truth or
[32:25] not you know
[32:27] know whether the gift was telling the
[32:28] truth or
[32:31] not for instance if someone says I
[32:34] dreamt
[32:35] this or someone gives a prophecy that
[32:38] say the Lord
[32:41] ABCD so then they would bring you before
[32:43] the high
[32:45] priest and then they will tell you now
[32:47] can you please give your prophecy
[32:50] again and so then you would begin to
[32:53] give your
[32:54] prophecy when the high priest is
[32:56] standing there
[32:59] and with those
[33:04] stones now if your prophecy or your your
[33:07] gift was saying the
[33:11] truth all those stones would begin to
[33:13] light different
[33:14] [Music]
[33:16] colors in response to what you are
[33:20] saying so that would be a symbol that
[33:23] what the person was saying was from
[33:25] God
[33:29] and everybody would believe it and
[33:31] fear but if what you were saying was not
[33:35] true and you came before the high priest
[33:41] with you know you know a prophet would
[33:44] would tell us that some sometimes people
[33:46] dream because they've eaten too
[33:51] much and sometimes because you've heard
[33:53] things from some other
[33:55] place
[33:57] not all Dreams Come From The
[34:00] Lord but but some dreams Come From The
[34:03] Lord so you see those things need to be
[34:07] tested and in the Old Testament it was
[34:09] being it was tested by the
[34:14] Ure and and so when you came you know
[34:18] with your dream when it is just coming
[34:20] out of Glon or whatever it
[34:25] is and you are telling people that this
[34:28] is thus say the
[34:30] Lord and the stones would not respond to
[34:35] you it be quiet silent and they would
[34:40] get you they say you a false prophet and
[34:43] they would Stone you to
[34:47] death I believe we have another
[34:51] today praise the name of the Lord we
[34:54] have amen Jesus Christ the high priest
[34:57] now we know that bam says the old and
[35:00] the New
[35:03] Testament it
[35:06] is so everything that is said whether it
[35:10] is a gift someone having a gift and
[35:14] prophesying or dreaming a dream telling
[35:16] a dream or things like
[35:19] that so we we can now be able to test it
[35:24] also I just say thank God for the
[35:27] message of the
[35:28] hour that we can take everything and we
[35:31] give it a word
[35:35] test that's why in the message we don't
[35:37] fear anyone to preach to
[35:40] us we don't I remember when I was in the
[35:43] Anglican
[35:45] church we had you know lessons or
[35:51] sermons that is
[35:54] written and you know a reading that will
[35:57] be read and everything so everything is
[36:02] programmed and so you just the priest
[36:04] would just have to follow and it will be
[36:06] the same thing all over the
[36:11] diis in theost they beginning to do the
[36:15] same whereby the man on top will send
[36:18] sermons or sermon notes or something and
[36:20] then everybody will follow
[36:24] that because they have to ensure that
[36:27] the right Doctrine is
[36:31] preached and you know the devil is
[36:33] trying to attack the
[36:35] message to tell us that we also should
[36:39] not preach by
[36:42] inspiration that you know we should take
[36:45] only one book of the
[36:47] prophet and um and um you know read that
[36:50] or play it for play the sermon for the
[36:55] people and that that is the only way the
[36:58] message should be
[37:00] preached and they're saying that you
[37:02] should just press and
[37:04] play and preachers should not no longer
[37:07] preach
[37:11] inspiration because we they fearing
[37:14] wrong
[37:16] Doctrine no wrong Doctrine is not
[37:18] hindered that
[37:20] way we have something that tests wrong
[37:24] Doctrine and that is the word have been
[37:27] given in
[37:28] our so we don't any man who claims to
[37:31] have been sent by
[37:33] God let him come and preach let him come
[37:37] and give a message let him come and give
[37:39] an
[37:40] inspiration anybody that claims to have
[37:42] a
[37:43] gift we we don't fear gifts we love
[37:48] gifts we love Tes we love
[37:52] inspiration interpretation of
[37:54] Tong you know brother says Tong when
[37:58] interpreted is a
[38:03] prophecy amen so we we we love
[38:06] tongues we we we love
[38:09] prophecies we love spiritual dreams we
[38:12] are not scared of those
[38:14] things how many are scared of those
[38:16] things
[38:17] here we are not scared of those things
[38:21] we love the
[38:23] supernatural but we are given our Ure
[38:26] and
[38:28] which is going to test every one of
[38:30] those
[38:32] Inspirations don't just follow
[38:35] Shish or follow
[38:37] blindly we have something that tests
[38:40] whatever we
[38:42] hear and that is the word of
[38:45] God Amen thank God for that and so the
[38:49] high priest would wear
[38:53] the and so he also offered a sin
[38:55] offering for the sins of the whole
[39:01] congregation so he's a man that would do
[39:04] that so he also sprinkled Blood on the M
[39:08] seat in the holy of
[39:10] [Music]
[39:12] holies to make atonement for the
[39:15] people's
[39:16] sins so a high priest was a very
[39:19] important man in the Old
[39:23] Testament and you know in the holy of
[39:25] holies would enter there once a
[39:30] year and that place being so
[39:33] holy sh Glory the presence of
[39:38] God the high priest would not just enter
[39:40] there
[39:41] also he would have to first give an
[39:44] offering of
[39:45] blood for himself and for the
[39:48] people and then even entering
[39:51] there they will tie a chain on
[39:53] him that as he went there
[39:57] if something happened and maybe he
[40:01] died or because he was not
[40:04] accepted or because he was not
[40:07] perfect because of any any reason and
[40:11] then he died there no one would enter
[40:13] there to remove
[40:15] him because he would also die from
[40:18] there so then they had to just pull
[40:22] him because the presence of God was in
[40:25] the holy of Hol
[40:29] you know the sh
[40:30] Glory was in the holy of
[40:33] holies but I want to say
[40:35] tonight we have a high
[40:38] priest a high priest who is even greater
[40:41] than he that was in the Old
[40:44] Testament that
[40:46] office amen was just a
[40:49] shadow of the real office of a high
[40:54] priest the real high priest
[40:57] Jesus Christ the Bible says he our high
[41:01] priest he's our Apostle and high
[41:05] priest
[41:07] amen and in Hebrews chapter
[41:10] 9 vers
[41:13] 24 he says for Christ is not entered
[41:16] into the holy places made with hands
[41:19] which are the figures of the true but
[41:21] into heaven itself now to appear in the
[41:24] presence of God for us
[41:40] one time someone asked me where is the
[41:42] Corporal body of Jesus
[41:48] now but here is what the Bible says that
[41:51] Christ our high
[41:55] priest for did not only enter into the
[41:57] holy places or into the holy of holies
[41:59] made with
[42:25] hands
[42:28] [Music]
[42:32] for then must he often have suffered
[42:35] since the for once in the end of the
[42:38] world has he appeared to put away sin by
[42:41] the sacrifice of
[42:55] himself
[42:57] the high priest went in there once every
[43:00] year once every year once every year to
[43:05] Aton for his sins and the sins of
[43:07] [Music]
[43:08] others but and you know that high priest
[43:11] had to be a good
[43:13] man a holy man a man without physical
[43:17] defects but Jesus Christ before he was
[43:21] sacrificed you remember what happened
[43:24] you know they said he is
[43:27] bless he was not found with any
[43:30] guilt the man was
[43:32] sinless he did not have any
[43:35] defect who was he he was the Lamb of God
[43:40] that was supposed to take away all the
[43:41] sins
[43:42] of and when he came and he died what did
[43:46] he do he went into the holy of
[43:50] holies but this time not with the blood
[43:53] of bulls and
[43:55] goats the blood of God
[43:58] himself the blood of Jesus was not the
[44:00] blood of
[44:02] Jesus the the book of Acts
[44:05] says amen the blood of God
[44:10] himself the blood of
[44:12] God that is not
[44:15] temporal it is permanent the blood of
[44:18] bus and
[44:19] gods did not wash away
[44:22] sins but it covered
[44:25] sins blood of Jesus does not cover sins
[44:30] it washes them to the exent but the BAM
[44:33] says that he takes them into the sea of
[44:37] forgetfulness once your sins are
[44:41] repented and they under the
[44:43] blood once you repent once you now we
[44:46] are coming to the
[44:47] confession once you confess your sin you
[44:51] repent of your sins and you confess them
[44:54] they have removed from you and placed
[44:59] under the
[45:01] blood anything that is under the
[45:05] blood cannot be remembered
[45:09] anymore does God ever
[45:12] forget God does not forget but he only
[45:16] forgets the sins that are you are placed
[45:19] under the
[45:20] blood he can never remember
[45:23] them call it the Sea of forgetful
[45:27] He blesses those sea under those sins
[45:29] under the sea of
[45:32] forgetfulness it can never be
[45:35] remembered they have gone away from
[45:38] you you as being a human
[45:42] being may remember in your mind what you
[45:46] did and even the devil might try to
[45:48] remind
[45:49] you but Jesus Christ does not
[45:54] remember amen I want you to imagine that
[45:58] the power of the blood tell somebody the
[46:01] power of the blood the blood is so
[46:04] powerful that it removes
[46:07] Sin from The
[46:09] Sinner the blood of of our high
[46:13] priest the blood of God
[46:16] himself and he says that for him he
[46:19] suffered
[46:21] once and for
[46:23] all once and for all
[46:26] and the message the testimony the
[46:30] SE says now how many teachers here know
[46:33] that he is a high
[46:37] priest right now that he can be touched
[46:41] by the feeling of our
[46:44] infirmities well if he is the same
[46:46] yesterday today and
[46:48] forever and the high priest he would act
[46:52] the same
[46:53] way only his body is on the Throne of
[46:57] God and he says how many knows
[47:00] that the body of
[47:03] Jesus is on the throne of
[47:06] God but he uses our body to manifest
[47:10] himself
[47:13] through just like he promised to do he
[47:16] said the works that I do shall you
[47:22] also now we know and we can talk a lot
[47:25] about our high
[47:27] priest but in the service this
[47:30] evening i' rather I want to dwell on the
[47:32] confession our
[47:36] confession we know who our high priest
[47:39] is is Jesus
[47:42] Christ but now the Bible says he the
[47:44] high priest of our
[47:49] profession there is a power that we
[47:52] hold and uh I want to try to see if I
[47:56] can be able to emphasize on this this
[48:00] evening many times Believers are
[48:04] defeated not because God has
[48:07] failed we have already seen his
[48:10] part he's a high priest he is determined
[48:14] to accomplish
[48:16] it when he gave his word he he
[48:21] signed with his own blood to assure us
[48:26] that his word cannot
[48:29] fail his blood is all
[48:33] powerful his blood can wash our
[48:36] sins his blood can heal our
[48:39] diseases his blood can take us out of
[48:41] our conditions his blood is all
[48:45] powerful when we talk about his blood we
[48:49] are talking about his grace we're
[48:51] talking about his power we're talking
[48:53] about his love all that is
[48:59] powerless without our
[49:04] confession there is a
[49:08] power in
[49:11] confession in the Book of Proverbs
[49:13] chapter 18 verse
[49:15] 20 a man's belly shall be satisfied with
[49:19] the fruit of his
[49:24] mouth and with increase of his lips
[49:27] shall he be
[49:32] filled let me read that again in case
[49:34] you
[49:35] missed a man's belly shall be satisfied
[49:38] with the fruit of his
[49:42] mouth the fruit of your
[49:46] mouth what is the fruit of your
[49:49] mouth are the words you prophesy over
[49:53] yourself are the words you you
[49:56] speak is the fruit of your
[49:59] mouth what a man
[50:02] speaketh is just out of the abundance of
[50:05] his
[50:07] heart that's why as we shall see later
[50:10] on in the Book of Romans
[50:13] 10:10 it says for with a man for with a
[50:16] heart man believeth unto
[50:22] righteous you believe with your heart un
[50:26] righteousness how many believe here we
[50:30] all believe we believe with our heart
[50:33] but he he goes ahead to say and with the
[50:38] mouth with the mouth confession is made
[50:43] unto
[50:44] salvation so in other words you may
[50:47] believe in your
[50:49] heart but you can never be
[50:53] saved if you do not confess it on your
[50:57] mouth that is why from the Old
[51:00] Testament when the word of God was
[51:02] brought
[51:03] for for it to apply the people had to
[51:07] answer by saying
[51:10] amen meaning so be it what he said is
[51:13] true we
[51:15] agree Moses would bring it from the Lord
[51:18] and then he would ask the people do you
[51:19] believe
[51:20] it they would say
[51:22] Amen we all agree that's why even in
[51:26] church we say
[51:28] amen that's even when the the word of
[51:31] God is being preached to
[51:33] you don't just sit and
[51:35] relax don't just be quiet but many times
[51:39] say that a
[51:41] gift is a man taking himself out of the
[51:44] place and then God using
[51:47] him and now that is for a
[51:50] minister but even for the people when
[51:53] the word of God comes
[51:56] it takes you to take yourself out of the
[51:58] place and to accept that word to say
[52:02] Amen to that word now a
[52:06] minister allows God to use his
[52:09] mouth and then the late the
[52:12] people they must also allow
[52:16] God to to to to to accept that word
[52:21] in by saying amen when you say Amen
[52:25] you are receiving the
[52:27] word are you are you following me now so
[52:31] with a man with a heart a man
[52:34] believeth unto
[52:36] righteousness but with the mouth
[52:38] confession is made unto
[52:42] salvation and here we see that a man is
[52:46] Bell shall be satisfied with the fruit
[52:47] of his
[52:51] mouth and with the increase of his lips
[52:53] shall he be filled
[52:59] death and life are in the power of the
[53:05] tongue tell your neighbor the power of
[53:07] the
[53:09] tongue so there is a
[53:11] power that is hidden in your
[53:13] [Music]
[53:15] T praise God praise God God gives you
[53:20] that power to
[53:22] speak and if a man can speak
[53:26] speak a man can be
[53:32] saved one of the last things to leave
[53:34] the
[53:36] man is the power of
[53:40] speech the thief on the
[53:43] cross was a sinner he was going to hell
[53:47] but this man had the power of
[53:51] speech he could not be baptized no
[53:54] opportunity for that
[53:56] anymore he could not do
[53:59] anything but one thing he had the power
[54:02] to
[54:03] do was to say
[54:05] something was to speak the only thing
[54:09] that saved the thief on the
[54:11] cross was the power of his
[54:15] tongue he only spoke and he said
[54:18] remember me when you get into your
[54:22] kingdom and the thing that killed the
[54:24] other
[54:27] was the power in his
[54:29] Tong he did not speak well he did not
[54:33] speak the right thing and when he spoke
[54:35] the wrong thing it brought the wrath of
[54:39] God remember brother dramatizes
[54:42] it that on the
[54:45] cross went to hell and you know when
[54:48] brother when when Jesus reached
[54:50] hell and and and he went to this place
[54:54] where this man
[54:56] was there were many others like him and
[55:00] when he he opened the door they were all
[55:04] shouting all
[55:07] shouting help us open for us help they
[55:12] were shouting different
[55:14] voices but the power of their tongue in
[55:16] Hell could not save them
[55:18] [Music]
[55:20] anymore time for Mery was
[55:24] over and brother bam says when Jesus
[55:28] opened he told them why didn't you
[55:33] believe Saints we are still on
[55:36] Earth let us
[55:38] believe let us use the power of our
[55:41] time let us speak the word let us agree
[55:44] with the word let us Speak Life instead
[55:48] of and life are in the power of the
[55:52] tongue and they that love is shall eat
[55:55] the fruit
[55:59] thereof
[56:01] hallelujah amen I believe it
[56:06] sister the power of the time by saying
[56:11] amen I believe it
[56:14] brother God was
[56:16] moved she said the right
[56:20] thing brother sister said the right
[56:23] words when you said the right words it
[56:26] will bring the power of the Holy
[56:29] Ghost to come and make it come to
[56:33] pass when you say the right
[56:35] words it will
[56:37] provoke the power of the Holy
[56:40] Ghost come and cause
[56:43] them to happen in your
[56:45] life praise
[56:48] God I'll read the same scripture in the
[56:53] Amplified
[56:57] will be
[56:58] satisfied the fruit of his
[57:02] mouth he will be
[57:05] satisfied with the consequence of his
[57:11] words which words do you
[57:14] speak in your life which words do you
[57:18] speak in your
[57:20] situation in your home at your job which
[57:24] words do you speak to your
[57:26] children your parents which words do you
[57:29] prophesy over your
[57:31] life did you know that whatever you
[57:34] prophesy over your
[57:35] life whatever you speak whether because
[57:39] of less
[57:41] Revelation or because of situation or
[57:44] because of problem that is what will
[57:49] happen the words you
[57:51] speak if you say I'm strong you'll be
[57:53] strong
[57:55] if you say I'm an overcomer you'll be an
[57:57] overcomer there are consequences to the
[58:00] words we
[58:02] speak you know the Believers are not
[58:06] expected to speak Idol
[58:10] words may God help each and every one of
[58:14] us that our
[58:16] mouth I think it's it's a scripture that
[58:18] David David was
[58:21] praying he says let the words of my
[58:24] mouth
[58:26] and let the meditations of my
[58:28] heart be acceptable unto you oh
[58:32] Lord the words of my
[58:34] mouth and here he says there there is
[58:37] consequences in in your
[58:41] words I'm talking about
[58:44] words anything you use your mouth to
[58:48] speak death and
[58:50] life are in the power of the
[58:53] tongue and those love
[58:55] it and indulge it will eat its
[59:01] fruit oh my those who love those
[59:05] words those who love
[59:07] words and indul it and use
[59:10] it will eat his
[59:13] fruit and bear the consequences of their
[59:21] words those who love the
[59:23] tongue and and and indulge it and use
[59:26] it do you know you can have a weapon and
[59:30] you choose not to use it but you you can
[59:33] also have a
[59:34] weapon and you choose to use it how do
[59:38] you pray you pray with your tongue how
[59:41] do you speak you speak with your T you
[59:45] know you can listen to someone
[59:47] speaking after they have spoken you'll
[59:49] be so
[59:51] heavy you'll be so Disturbed is that not
[59:56] true and others will speak and you'll be
[59:59] excited you'll be
[1:00:02] happy someone spoke of brother
[1:00:06] Bram and he said when you were with
[1:00:09] him he made you to feel like a great
[1:00:13] man but there are some people you speak
[1:00:16] to and you feel like it was even a
[1:00:18] mistake to speak to
[1:00:22] them some people that will speak death
[1:00:24] to
[1:00:26] you will speak defeat to you they will
[1:00:29] speak c words to
[1:00:31] you so it's not about only what you
[1:00:33] speak but also what you
[1:00:36] hear what you speak and what others
[1:00:39] speak to
[1:00:40] you that's why as Believers there are
[1:00:44] words we should not
[1:00:46] hear but when we hear them they they
[1:00:49] bring a wrong spe in our
[1:00:52] life that these movies with C
[1:00:56] Words If you be watching those
[1:00:59] movies as a young person you're going to
[1:01:02] be filled with that kind of
[1:01:04] life you know the devil will bring you
[1:01:07] down to that
[1:01:08] level whereby you are looking at life
[1:01:11] that
[1:01:12] way when you are speaking to a
[1:01:15] fornicator and is your best
[1:01:17] friend and to him fornication is not a
[1:01:21] problem it is all right so when you
[1:01:23] speak to them
[1:01:25] the more you speak to them the more you
[1:01:28] realize they are right and you are
[1:01:31] wrong because they speaking more and
[1:01:33] you're speaking
[1:01:36] less preach on
[1:01:39] influences know either your friend is
[1:01:42] influencing you or you're influencing
[1:01:46] them I don't know about you but I want
[1:01:49] to be the one to influence
[1:01:50] people I don't want to be influenced by
[1:01:53] demons
[1:01:55] I want to be the one to influence this
[1:01:57] world I want to live in this world that
[1:02:01] wherever I go the devil will know that I
[1:02:04] passed
[1:02:06] that when Jesus was
[1:02:09] coming approaching this man at the TOs
[1:02:12] of
[1:02:14] Gad this man the demons in him realized
[1:02:20] who Jesus was before he even
[1:02:23] arrived before he even said a word those
[1:02:27] demons were so
[1:02:29] fearful of the words Jesus was going
[1:02:34] to the devil knows the power of the
[1:02:38] word the devil knows the power of
[1:02:41] the especially coming out of a child of
[1:02:45] God and as Jesus was
[1:02:48] approaching you know those demons
[1:02:50] started trembling
[1:02:51] in please it's not our time don't kill
[1:02:56] us don't finish us and Jesus
[1:03:00] spoke Hallelujah and Jesus
[1:03:04] spoke and he cast out those
[1:03:06] demons let me tell you when if you have
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ in your
[1:03:12] life wherever you go demons will
[1:03:16] tremble because they will know you have
[1:03:19] arrived because they will know you are
[1:03:21] arriving Hallelujah don't be like those
[1:03:25] who are possessed by the
[1:03:28] devil whereby you
[1:03:31] fear the people who have God in
[1:03:35] them how do we do we know that you fear
[1:03:38] them your
[1:03:41] associations your friends your best
[1:03:44] friends we now have
[1:03:46] WhatsApp who do you
[1:03:48] WhatsApp we can also see that by what
[1:03:51] you stat
[1:03:53] us are you
[1:03:55] statusing which words are you
[1:03:59] writing which language are you
[1:04:01] using remember whatever words you speak
[1:04:04] it is
[1:04:07] prophesying it is powerful there is a
[1:04:10] consequence on every word you
[1:04:13] speak whether in secret or in
[1:04:16] public words are
[1:04:18] powerful words create and words
[1:04:22] destroy what are you going to
[1:04:25] as far as I'm concerned I want to be an
[1:04:28] influence in this
[1:04:30] world that my voice shall be hard my
[1:04:34] voice will
[1:04:35] influence the people of the people of
[1:04:38] the children of God to come closer to
[1:04:41] God come closer to
[1:04:44] God how in the words I
[1:04:47] speak even now as I'm speaking to you
[1:04:50] I'm influencing your
[1:04:52] life how by the power of the
[1:04:56] time how has God ordained the gospel to
[1:04:58] be
[1:05:00] preached not by sign language not by
[1:05:03] books not by anything but by Tong the
[1:05:08] power of a tongue because the gospel has
[1:05:11] to be
[1:05:13] preached by the Tongue by speaking
[1:05:17] because as you
[1:05:18] speak as words
[1:05:21] come they bring they create something
[1:05:23] within
[1:05:27] so there is death and life in the power
[1:05:31] of the
[1:05:33] tong I I hope we all shall get this
[1:05:36] after I'm
[1:05:38] done praise
[1:05:40] God there's a lot I could say but
[1:05:42] there's a one long quote I want to read
[1:05:44] and then I will finish with that it's
[1:05:45] just a long a long quote out of the
[1:05:47] message accept God
[1:05:53] gift I'll just go through that quote and
[1:05:55] just to encourage you and then I I'll
[1:05:57] finish
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:05:59] with don't have a negative
[1:06:04] testimony tell your neighbor don't have
[1:06:06] a negative
[1:06:10] testimony you see this is why many times
[1:06:13] while I'm preaching I ask you to speak
[1:06:14] because there is power in in the

[1:08:30] confession Hebrews 31 now any scholar
[1:08:32] knows that that same word profession is
[1:08:38] confession now sitting at the right hand
[1:08:41] of the father to make intercession upon
[1:08:43] what our
[1:08:48] confession so Jesus has power he's a
[1:08:53] high priest
[1:08:54] just like the high priest in the Old
[1:08:57] Testament was the one you know atoning
[1:09:00] the sins of the
[1:09:02] people he was like the middle
[1:09:05] man between God and
[1:09:07] man but in the same in the same way
[1:09:10] today we have Jesus the Bible says he
[1:09:14] the only mediator between between man
[1:09:16] and
[1:09:18] God the man Christ
[1:09:22] Jesus who is is the high priest our high
[1:09:27] priest but the high priest only has one
[1:09:31] thing to
[1:09:32] you our
[1:09:35] confession he hears what we we
[1:09:38] spoke and then that is how he he
[1:09:44] executes he can't do any he cannot do
[1:09:47] nothing for
[1:09:49] you until first you confess him has done
[1:09:57] it everything he promised to
[1:09:59] do he cannot do it for you until you
[1:10:03] have

[1:10:11] accepted I'm not Sav tonight because I
[1:10:13] get happy and
[1:10:16] Shout that is not it I am not saved
[1:10:20] because the gift of God works through
[1:10:22] me
[1:10:24] I am saved
[1:10:26] because I have met the conditions that
[1:10:29] Jesus Christ required for
[1:10:33] me I am saved according to the
[1:10:38] Bible can weep you around the samp on
[1:10:41] your
[1:10:44] feelings but he he cannot when it is th
[1:10:48] say the

[1:11:15] point as if you are not
[1:11:18] saved how I even go to
[1:11:21] heaven are feeling
[1:11:25] but don't say it on your
[1:11:27] mouth the devil wants you to profess a
[1:11:29] negative
[1:11:30] feeling it's not about what you're
[1:11:33] feeling it is about what the word
[1:11:37] says and if it is that sayth the
[1:11:40] Lord you are saved it doesn't matter how
[1:11:44] you
[1:11:45] feel just confess it I am
[1:11:49] saved and many of us oh since we we

[1:11:55] Christ we cannot as much as we feel
[1:11:58] sometimes as if we are not
[1:12:00] saved but we can't accept to confess we
[1:12:03] are not
[1:12:05] saved because we know according to the
[1:12:09] word we are sa the devil can't change
[1:12:14] that no demon can change that because of
[1:12:18] that we are
[1:12:21] saved Hallelujah because about

[1:13:01] feeling but he cannot when is that say
[1:13:03] the
[1:13:05] Lord he can't do that he can't we across
[1:13:10] that that will defeat him thank God we
[1:13:14] have a high
[1:13:15] priest Hallelujah and he has saved he
[1:13:19] has saved us he has given us his word
[1:13:23] the word for the Salvation of our
[1:13:26] souls we believe it we confess it and

[1:21:27] associations associate yourself with
[1:21:30] those that
[1:21:32] believe in the promise of God for your
[1:21:35] life God told Abraham go to a land that
[1:21:39] I will show you and I'm going to give
[1:21:42] you a son look at the stars your
[1:21:45] generation shall be like Abraham was
[1:21:48] excited Abraham believed it but along
[1:21:52] the way
[1:21:53] he carried his
[1:21:55] cousin God has given him
[1:21:57] promises let us go and while he was
[1:22:01] associating himself with
[1:22:03] Lord God became
[1:22:05] quiet did you ever ask yourself why God
[1:22:08] was
[1:22:09] quiet maybe lot was always you know
[1:22:13] telling him about his own
[1:22:15] things Abraham do you know I I am
[1:22:18] dreaming of this
[1:22:20] city where there is this and that
[1:22:23] you know these kind of games that and
[1:22:26] this and that Abraham do you you know
[1:22:29] that we can find that
[1:22:31] City rumors that there's a city called
[1:22:35] Sodom and there is even another
[1:22:39] called you can have a good
[1:22:42] time Abraham do you know that we can
[1:22:45] have we can be you know really great
[1:22:47] men can achieve a lot now with you God
[1:22:51] has even given you a promise
[1:22:53] if he went there you don't know what can
[1:22:56] happen the time abrah maybe was
[1:23:00] bring because Abraham loved lot so
[1:23:03] much lot was a cousin and he loved him
[1:23:07] so much the devil will not tempt you
[1:23:10] with people you don't
[1:23:12] love sometimes you will come in friends
[1:23:14] that you love so
[1:23:17] dear and then you begin
[1:23:19] associating but whereas they are leading
[1:23:21] you away from the promises
[1:23:24] of but time came Abraham made up his
[1:23:28] mind he said from today I don't care
[1:23:31] what I feel I disregard it I'm only
[1:23:35] going to regard what God's word

[1:24:23] the house of God our joy is in the word
[1:24:26] of God not in the things that of the
[1:24:29] world when Abraham stayed alone he
[1:24:33] looked as if he was
[1:24:34] lonely but because he had disassociated
[1:24:37] himself with
[1:24:40] un God came again and God spoke to him
[1:24:44] again and Abraham be went into a very
[1:24:48] poor

[1:36:16] is a way to be
[1:36:19] encouraged you know when the devil when
[1:36:21] the spirit of discouragement comes on
[1:36:23] you and begin talking to
[1:36:26] you and then you begin
[1:36:29] saying for sure I'm
[1:36:31] finished the spirit of discouragement
[1:36:33] begins
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] smiling that's where I want you but when
[1:36:40] now when he heard me preaching about the
[1:36:42] high priest of our
[1:36:44] confession the devil became so
[1:36:47] sad but now when he sees you realizing
[1:36:50] your place
[1:36:52] the devil is completely finished in the
[1:36:54] church Ed by says if the Church of God
[1:36:58] will know who she is and what she stands
[1:37:02] for amen she will be an invisible
[1:37:07] Army an army which the devil cannot
[1:37:11] defeat an army which the devil will
[1:37:14] attack but the devil cannot defeat
[1:37:18] it once we understand this
[1:37:22] now we can go into the deep Mysteries of
[1:37:23] the
[1:37:24] world but before we go into the
[1:37:27] Mysteries let us get this
[1:37:30] basics of where we should put our Roots
[1:37:34] where we should put our anchor where we
[1:37:36] should be as
[1:37:37] Believers whereby we are
[1:37:40] unshakeable amen whereby we are holding
[1:37:44] on onto the Rock of
[1:37:47] Ages let me finish this qut now our son
[1:37:51] brother please well if Solomon prayed
[1:37:54] that
[1:37:56] prayer there is no one
[1:37:58] here that's in the
[1:38:01] condition
[1:38:03] halfway like Jonah
[1:38:05] was you ain't got no nothing like the
[1:38:09] symptoms he
[1:38:14] had well if he in that condition could
[1:38:18] look at the temple where it was built by
[1:38:20] hand of a
[1:38:26] man and Earthly being a man Solomon
[1:38:29] sitting and praying and could have faith
[1:38:31] in Solomon's
[1:38:40] Prayer how much more you and I
[1:38:46] tonight sitting here look to the throne
[1:38:50] of God
[1:38:52] where Jesus stands at the right hand
[1:38:56] with the blood
[1:38:59] there to make
[1:39:01] intercessions on your
[1:39:05] confession we have more than Solomon's
[1:39:09] Prayer we have Jesus himself the high
[1:39:12] priest on the right hand of the Throne
[1:39:14] of the
[1:39:15] maest amen ready ready to take our
[1:39:20] confession
[1:39:24] just and he says our Prophet says just
[1:39:27] refuse you have the
[1:39:31] symptoms Hallelujah if you all believe
[1:39:35] this in the next few moments we can have
[1:39:38] a Pentecostal service
[1:39:40] here in the next few moments whereby all
[1:39:43] of us can accept the word of God imagine
[1:39:47] Jonah Pentecost in the wom

[2:07:55] Hallelujah blessed be the name of the

[2:08:05] Paul when they had bound him and put him
[2:08:07] in a ship to cross the ocean taking him
[2:08:12] over to
[2:08:14] Rome I think to
[2:08:16] Paul he didn't know what was happening
[2:08:20] he thought this could be the end of me I
[2:08:24] don't know where these men are taking
[2:08:26] me all over him was a
[2:08:29] lake and the Sheep
[2:08:31] wrecked and when they stayed at the
[2:08:35] island even when he tried to gather the
[2:08:37] firewood again was beaten by a
[2:08:41] snake until his
[2:08:44] captors until those who looked at him
[2:08:47] those who observed him they had
[2:08:50] imaginations they say for sure this man
[2:08:53] was a
[2:08:54] murderer this man was
[2:08:56] wicked this man has sinned against his
[2:08:59] God this man is
[2:09:01] backsliding this man is no longer
[2:09:05] Christian but wait a
[2:09:08] moment when they looked a little at him
[2:09:12] expecting him to collapse accept him to
[2:09:15] faint accept him to die he just shook
[2:09:19] the Beast into the water into the into
[2:09:21] the fire and lived like any other person
[2:09:25] and they changed their opinion they
[2:09:28] changed their minds and they said this
[2:09:31] man is God this man is more than a human
[2:09:35] being this evening I declare and
[2:09:39] decree that let your enemies be totally
[2:09:43] confused about you let your enemies
