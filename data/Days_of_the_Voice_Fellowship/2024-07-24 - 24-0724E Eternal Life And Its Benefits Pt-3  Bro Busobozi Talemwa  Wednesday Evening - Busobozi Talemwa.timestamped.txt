[38:23] Saints evening light bright Tabernacle

[38:45] time eternal life and all its
[38:49] benefits you would call it part
[38:52] three but to the Saints on Zoom I think
[38:55] it won't it won't matter even if you not

[39:02] parts I trust that with this little
[39:04] sharing tonight will be a
[39:08] blessing amen we are reading vers

[39:24] shall not come into condemnation but is
[39:26] passed from death and into
[39:48] life amen you may be
[39:55] seated okay
[39:59] so I'm uh speaking on eternal life and
[40:01] all its
[40:04] [Music]
[40:05] benefits so we have been on this subject
[40:09] for the third time now
[40:14] tonight and uh those who have been
[40:17] following I'm sure that you are being
[40:19] blessed by
[40:22] this the reason for us to share
[40:25] this uh is um
[40:27] for us to know where we
[40:31] belong for us to know who we
[40:33] are what what we are waiting
[40:36] for what we are expecting to
[40:40] happen uh because we are not just
[40:44] Christians we are the bride are you
[40:47] following me we are not just Christians
[40:51] or following
[40:55] Christ we are the bride
[40:58] I want to emphasize
[41:00] that there are many Christians in the
[41:03] world
[41:03] [Music]
[41:05] today people who claim to believe on the
[41:08] Lord
[41:10] Jesus and indeed they
[41:13] believe and some of those or many of
[41:16] those who claim to believe on the Lord
[41:21] Jesus they do not have eternal
[41:25] life the reason why they don't have
[41:27] eternal
[41:28] life is because they have not subjected
[41:31] their souls fully under the
[41:37] word they claim they
[41:40] believe they claim they understand the
[41:44] Bible but when it comes to living the
[41:49] life they do not have the ability to
[41:52] live the
[41:54] life just follow me and don't don't lose
[41:56] the thought now they don't have the
[41:59] ability to to to to uh to live the
[42:03] life because they they do not
[42:06] believe you see you can only live the
[42:10] life of the
[42:12] word if the life of the word is in
[42:17] you did you know you cannot actually
[42:20] believe the word and leave the
[42:24] word if the life of the word is not in
[42:26] you
[42:29] and that life is
[42:31] eternal it's eternal life it's a life of
[42:35] God it is zoy and there is only one
[42:38] source of
[42:39] life that is zoy God is own
[42:42] life but you see if you have that life
[42:45] in
[42:46] you it means you are filled with the
[42:49] spirit of
[42:51] God and if you're filled with the spirit
[42:53] of
[42:54] God it means you are a candidate for the
[43:00] so you see it can if every Christian is
[43:03] not going to the
[43:05] Rapture it can only mean that there are
[43:07] many who claimed they
[43:12] believed but they actually did not
[43:15] believe because we are going to go in
[43:17] the
[43:18] Rapture on the basis that we have
[43:20] believed the word of
[43:23] God our Prophet told us and he said that
[43:27] full
[43:29] obedience to the full word of
[43:32] God entitles you to the
[43:37] Token the token is the life of
[43:40] God the token is the holy spirit it is a
[43:45] seal the Bible says we are sealed by
[43:48] it until the day of our
[43:52] Redemption the moment you are
[43:54] sealed by the Holy Spirit
[43:57] you cannot be
[43:59] unsealed he abides with you until the
[44:04] day of of your
[44:05] Redemption it is the
[44:08] earnest of the life that Christ
[44:11] purchased for us on the
[44:13] cross I don't know whether you
[44:15] understand what I'm talking about amen
[44:17] if you understand what I'm saying just
[44:18] say Amen whever you
[44:20] are so you see it is a the Hest of the
[44:24] life and um you know the we are not
[44:27] going to receive the
[44:30] life that life we have already received
[44:32] it
[44:34] now and it comes to us in our hearts by
[44:39] Faith by faith in the in in the finished
[44:44] work and I told you that those who are
[44:46] going to go in the
[44:48] Rapture are not going to go to the
[44:50] Rapture by their
[44:53] works you know the the Believers who
[44:56] will go in the
[44:58] rure it will be because they are
[45:02] sealed by the spirit of
[45:05] God and they cannot be sealed by the
[45:07] spirit of
[45:09] God unless they have believed the
[45:12] word with all their
[45:15] heart unless they have accepted to walk
[45:17] in the way in the narrow
[45:20] way the narrow way is the word of
[45:23] God you know when Jesus came on Earth he
[45:27] met the
[45:28] Pharisees the Pharisees claimed to be uh
[45:31] to believe the
[45:33] word and they claimed they were they
[45:36] claimed they were sons of
[45:38] Abraham by
[45:40] faith and of course they said they're
[45:42] sons of Abraham and which means they
[45:44] also from
[45:47] God but when Jesus designed
[45:51] them he said ah you are saying you are
[45:54] sons of
[45:55] Abraham but you would have received me
[45:59] you would have accepted me you would
[46:01] have believed my words but because you
[46:05] don't you are of your father the
[46:08] devil so you see because Jesus was the
[46:12] embodiment of all the word they had
[46:14] believed before they claimed to have
[46:20] believed they had all the theology in
[46:22] their
[46:24] head but they did not have the present
[46:30] truth do you know people can actually
[46:33] believe the Revelation they have in
[46:36] their
[46:39] time but when they fail to receive the
[46:41] word of their
[46:44] day they cannot be called
[46:47] Believers so when I'm talking about
[46:50] believers who are going to go in the
[46:52] Rapture who have believed the word I'm
[46:55] talking about those who have believed
[46:56] the word of their
[47:00] day who have received the revelation of
[47:02] the word of their
[47:04] hour when Paul came he was the messenger
[47:08] of the hour he had the word of the of
[47:10] their day when Iranians came he had the
[47:14] word of their day when Martin came he
[47:17] had the word of their day when col came
[47:19] he had the word of their day when mtin
[47:21] Luther came he had the word of johnley
[47:25] he had the word of William Bram he has
[47:28] the word of our
[47:30] day it is not another Revelation from
[47:33] the
[47:34] Bible it is actually the true revelation
[47:37] of the
[47:39] Bible and we are living in the last
[47:41] days when God has brought the last final
[47:47] Revelation in the age of Paul they were
[47:49] the uh they were the alpha bride were
[47:52] were Alpha
[47:54] bride and all those who died from Paul
[47:58] up to our day they died in Christ and
[48:02] they waiting for the resurrection but
[48:06] now they cannot be
[48:08] resurrected until the Omega bride also
[48:11] shows
[48:13] up who is the Omega bride the Omega
[48:17] bride is the one that comes in the last
[48:20] age the last day the one who will also
[48:23] believe the word of day
[48:27] that's why brother bam said if he was to
[48:30] be
[48:31] asked which generation he would have
[48:33] been
[48:34] in he would say he said that it would be
[48:37] he would have said he would have wanted
[48:38] to be in the last
[48:41] age this is the last
[48:44] age thean Church age but you know God
[48:48] has is doing the final
[48:51] work we are the we are the Omega
[48:54] bride we are the last bride
[48:57] even if you don't feel like that you are
[48:59] you are the Omega
[49:01] bride you are the Omega bride because
[49:04] you are the one who was received the
[49:05] final
[49:07] revelation of the word of the
[49:10] hour after this there is no more
[49:14] Revelation to the
[49:17] Gentiles we have received a full
[49:20] revelation of the full word of
[49:23] God and therefore we are finally ready
[49:27] for the coming of the Lord Jesus he did
[49:30] not come in the first age he did not
[49:32] come in the second age the third
[49:35] fourth but he was
[49:37] prophesied to come in the last age the
[49:41] final age and we are the bride living in
[49:45] the final age waiting to see the the
[49:48] Fulfillment of that
[49:51] prophecy praise the name of the
[49:54] Lord but now speaking of the
[49:57] Bride the bride receives the
[50:01] word the bride believes the
[50:05] word and doesn't take any other man's
[50:09] word he takes only the word of
[50:12] God he says very I un to you he that
[50:16] Heth my
[50:18] word and believe and and and believeth
[50:22] on him that sent
[50:24] me has Everlasting
[50:27] life and I told you that this is present
[50:32] tense he's not talking about shall
[50:34] receive eternal
[50:37] life has already received eternal
[50:41] life tell your neighbor the word is
[50:45] life hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[50:49] praise the name of the Lord that's why
[50:50] when Jesus came on
[50:52] Earth he was the life he said I am the
[50:55] way the truth the
[50:57] light so the moment you receive the
[51:01] word filled with the Holy Spirit you
[51:04] have received
[51:05] life that is eternal
[51:08] life and the Bible says the moment you
[51:10] receive that eternal
[51:12] life you you cannot come into
[51:16] condemnation you can never come to the
[51:19] Judgment
[51:21] Throne praise the name of the Lord and
[51:23] you know speaking of
[51:25] life you know
[51:27] what is life is is the life of God is
[51:31] the word you know we think it is
[51:35] doctrines is more than
[51:38] doctrines baptism in Jesus name one God
[51:42] no women preachers
[51:46] modesty you know Holiness you know you
[51:49] know Christian Living and
[51:52] allach the truth and the serpent seat
[51:55] the church ages
[51:57] the Seven Seals All these
[52:00] Revelations what is it all of them
[52:02] combined
[52:04] together it is the word of the
[52:07] hour and all those that shall receive
[52:09] the
[52:11] truth he said in in in the Bible it says
[52:13] Thy word is
[52:17] truth and in another place it says Thy
[52:19] word is a lamp unto my
[52:23] feet amen his word is life
[52:27] when you receive that life when you
[52:29] receive that
[52:31] word you are potentially
[52:34] standing with eternal
[52:39] life you do not qualify to come before
[52:42] the white Throne
[52:46] judgment but you qualify to go in
[52:51] Rapture there is nothing can hinder you
[52:53] to go from going to the rapture
[52:57] when you receive the Holy Spirit of
[53:00] course you cannot receive the Holy
[53:02] Spirit without receiving the
[53:05] full when you receive the Holy Spirit
[53:09] you you you you you eternal life is
[53:12] right in you you are just waiting for
[53:15] the change of your
[53:18] body and the good thing about this it is
[53:21] not about your
[53:23] feeling it's not about your thought
[53:27] it's about what he said in his
[53:30] word some many people think I don't feel
[53:32] like I have
[53:34] life I don't feel like I'm going in the
[53:37] Rapture brother do you believe the
[53:39] word have you had an experience with God
[53:43] the only thing you should do is wait for
[53:45] the coming of the
[53:47] Lord rest little bright
[53:50] rest all is well that's why when the
[53:54] prophet preached all the sermons
[53:57] there
[53:59] Shalom rest all is well bright peace
[54:03] everything is done everything is
[54:05] finished the bride is only waiting for
[54:07] one thing for the rapture we are no
[54:11] longer waiting for another man to
[54:13] come we are no longer waiting for
[54:15] another movement to come we are no
[54:17] longer waiting for another Revelation to
[54:20] come oh the revelations which were
[54:22] supposed to
[54:23] come it has already come
[54:27] and we have already received it and we
[54:29] are
[54:31] candidates of the
[54:34] Rapture what makes us
[54:37] worthy what makes us Worthy is only one
[54:42] thing the
[54:44] lamb hallelujah hallelujah his blood
[54:47] which was shed and ours is only to
[54:53] believe only believe if you believe the
[54:56] word if you accept and receive that word
[55:00] the only thing that you are you are
[55:02] remaining with the change of your body
[55:06] because you have received eternal
[55:08] life you are not waiting for eternal
[55:11] life you have received eternal life and
[55:15] the Bible says you sh by the way do we
[55:16] believe the
[55:18] Bible sometimes you read these things
[55:20] they become so
[55:22] common and we ere explain it and we want
[55:27] to over understand it can we tonight
[55:30] take What God Says in his
[55:33] word he says and shall
[55:36] not come into
[55:39] condemnation you have everlasting life
[55:43] and you shall not come into
[55:45] condemnation you have everlasting life
[55:48] and you shall not come into
[55:50] condemnation but he have passed from
[55:52] Death un life so in other words
[55:56] when the white Throne judgment shall
[56:00] come those people that have talked
[56:03] about not qualified to stand before
[56:07] it they will not be before the white
[56:09] Throne
[56:10] judgment no why because they have passed
[56:13] from Death to
[56:14] life they will not have any need of
[56:18] judgment they will not be judged so when
[56:22] when somebody tells you we shall all go
[56:25] before the word thr
[56:27] that does not apply to me it applies to
[56:32] them but as far as I'm concerned I have
[56:35] already passed
[56:37] condemnation I have already passed the
[56:40] Judgment amen and I'm already in
[56:43] life how can I be J when I have life in
[56:48] me how can I be Jud when the life of God
[56:52] himself the creator of Heaven and Earth
[56:56] dwelling in me it is impossible I have
[57:00] already passed some death into life it
[57:04] is present
[57:06] tense present
[57:08] tense praise the name of the Lord yes I
[57:12] know as I told you before that Believers
[57:16] the ones who go in Rapture they will
[57:18] also have their own
[57:21] judgment and that's what Paul
[57:23] meant when he said we will all stand
[57:25] before
[57:27] the Judgment seat of
[57:30] Christ and that will not be judgment
[57:33] unto
[57:36] condemnation it will be it will not be
[57:38] that way it will be
[57:42] accountability maybe one of these days
[57:44] we will go into that subject and talk
[57:46] about it
[57:48] more we will all give an
[57:51] account of how we lived Our
[57:53] Lives how we behaved how we talk to one
[57:57] another how we use the money God gave
[58:00] us how our
[58:02] lives really stood for Christ or
[58:06] not and at the end of it all we will not
[58:10] be th some will w't be thrown to
[58:13] hell they already have all life they
[58:15] already all of them already have
[58:19] life so in other words what is the
[58:22] intent of that
[58:24] judgment that intent is to determine the
[58:27] glory you will have when you get over
[58:33] there praise the name of the Lord Mama
[58:36] as I said we will get into
[58:38] that we will not all have the same
[58:43] Glory will be different
[58:46] glories but you see this white Throne
[58:49] judgment judgment and condemnation
[58:54] [Music]
[58:56] so now we are going to quote from the
[58:58] from the church age book in sadan church
[59:02] age please follow me
[59:05] closely now we all know that John
[59:09] 528 and we can read
[59:12] 28 Marvel not at this for the hour is
[59:15] coming in the which all all that are in
[59:18] the graves shall hear his voice and
[59:21] shall come forth they that have done
[59:24] good unto the resurrection of life and
[59:26] they that have done evil un the
[59:28] resurrection of the of
[59:47] damnation so you notice this is not the
[59:49] rupture
[59:51] now here he's talking about of course
[59:53] these are the two resurrections we
[59:54] talked about it in the first
[59:58] part these two
[1:00:00] resurrections one the first
[1:00:03] one is the
[1:00:05] Resurrection The Bible here is saying
[1:00:08] that um the hour is coming in the which
[1:00:10] that all that in the grave shall hear
[1:00:12] his
[1:00:14] voice and they shall they that have done
[1:00:16] good and resurrection of
[1:00:19] life and they that have done evil unto
[1:00:21] the resurrection of
[1:00:24] damnation so the first
[1:00:27] resurrection is what we the bride is
[1:00:29] going to be a part
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:32] of the Bible does speak about it in the
[1:00:34] Book of
[1:00:36] Revelation probably we get to talk about
[1:00:38] it in a moment so we see that those who
[1:00:43] will come in the first
[1:00:45] resurrection the Bible says the second
[1:00:48] death will have no power over
[1:00:51] them now the second death is a
[1:00:54] destruction of the
[1:00:57] Souls the second death is for those who
[1:01:00] will be thrown into
[1:01:03] hell after the white Throne
[1:01:07] judgment so now those who come in the
[1:01:09] first
[1:01:11] resurrection the second death won't have
[1:01:14] power over
[1:01:15] them but they that come in the second
[1:01:19] Resurrection you see when is the first
[1:01:22] resurrection the first resurrection is
[1:01:25] what we are waiting for
[1:01:27] now it could actually happen any
[1:01:30] time even any time from this
[1:01:33] moment as when will it happen it will
[1:01:36] happen when the last seed of God has
[1:01:38] come
[1:01:40] in the moment the last seed
[1:01:44] enters then the first resurrection will
[1:01:47] happen but you see that is why the Bible
[1:01:50] calls the
[1:01:51] Rapture the catching away of the
[1:01:54] Bride I am going to be a part of
[1:01:58] that but you see there is another
[1:02:01] resurrection that is when all that were
[1:02:06] dead all that were in the grav all that
[1:02:10] will be in the gra at the time they will
[1:02:12] rise up again and where will they go
[1:02:16] they will rise up to stand before the
[1:02:19] white Throne
[1:02:21] judg at that moment they will come to be
[1:02:24] judged
[1:02:27] many un
[1:02:30] condemnation and a few will be given an
[1:02:33] opportunity to receive
[1:02:37] life now you see the bride is not among
[1:02:42] those who shall receive life in the
[1:02:44] second
[1:02:47] Resurrection because the bride already
[1:02:50] has life when she's still on
[1:02:53] Earth how does she receive
[1:02:56] Life by Believing on the
[1:03:00] word by that's why we should always be
[1:03:02] Bible Believers the word
[1:03:06] Believers that's why we should never
[1:03:08] compromise the
[1:03:09] word amen let the world take away
[1:03:12] everything from
[1:03:14] you but hold on to God's unchanging
[1:03:18] word amen let all the pleasures of life
[1:03:22] go let all the money go let
[1:03:26] go hold your hand onto God's unchanging
[1:03:31] word there you know you are safe our sa
[1:03:35] is in
[1:03:36] faith faith in his word as long as he
[1:03:40] says it we don't care whether the
[1:03:42] society believes it or
[1:03:45] not praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:03:48] in the second
[1:03:49] Resurrection those will all be
[1:03:52] judged and a few as we shall see will be
[1:03:54] given life
[1:03:58] so John 5:28-29
[1:04:01] is not the
[1:04:03] Rapture for only the dead in Christ will
[1:04:06] arise from the graves at the time along
[1:04:10] with the living bride who is still on
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:20] earth that is the resurrection of the
[1:04:24] Bride are you understanding what I'm
[1:04:26] saying it is recorded in 1 Thessalonians
[1:04:29] 4:
[1:04:31] 16 it says for the Lord himself shall
[1:04:34] descend from heaven with a
[1:04:37] shout and with the voice of the
[1:04:39] Archangel and the Trump of God and then
[1:04:43] Christ shall rise
[1:04:45] fast then we which are alive and remain
[1:04:48] shall be C
[1:04:50] up together with them in the
[1:04:53] clouds to meet the Lord in the air
[1:04:56] and so shall we ever be with the
[1:04:59] Lord but here in John
[1:05:02] 5
[1:05:04] 28 that all he says that all are going
[1:05:08] to come forth from the
[1:05:11] grave he says all are going to
[1:05:15] resurrect so this resurrection of John
[1:05:19] 5 is not my
[1:05:22] resurrection whose Resurrection is it
[1:05:26] those who will be who will go in the
[1:05:30] tribulation it's not
[1:05:32] ours this is the now listen this is the
[1:05:35] very same
[1:05:36] resurrection that is spoken of in
[1:05:39] Revelation
[1:05:41] 2011 to
[1:05:43] 15 wherein the dead were brought before
[1:05:47] the Lord and
[1:05:49] judged according to their
[1:05:53] works are you following me Church
[1:05:56] you know where he says that then I
[1:06:00] saw both young and and old small and
[1:06:06] great and and and they all came
[1:06:10] resurrected they rose up and they all
[1:06:13] came and stood
[1:06:15] before and I saw a great white
[1:06:18] Throne you see and all these came and
[1:06:22] stood before
[1:06:24] the and he says and books were
[1:06:28] open and another book was
[1:06:31] open which is The Book of
[1:06:33] Life and everybody every one of these
[1:06:37] people was judged according to their
[1:06:40] Works according to what was written in
[1:06:42] the
[1:06:46] books Hallelujah according to their
[1:06:50] work are you following me so he would
[1:06:53] judge them according to their
[1:06:57] works oh my my my he will judge those
[1:07:01] people according to what they
[1:07:04] did but the bride was never judged
[1:07:08] according to what she
[1:07:10] did that's why they they are very busy
[1:07:13] saying it doesn't matter what you
[1:07:16] do but they are not Preparing People for
[1:07:18] the
[1:07:20] Rapture but I can tell you the bride it
[1:07:23] doesn't matter what you do
[1:07:26] that is for the
[1:07:28] bride because we are oh Hallelujah we
[1:07:31] are not going in
[1:07:33] Rapture on the basis of what we have
[1:07:36] done or what we have not
[1:07:39] done are you hearing
[1:07:43] meelu we are not going in the Rapture on
[1:07:46] the basis of our
[1:07:48] failures on the best of our good
[1:07:52] works our good works are like filthy
[1:07:55] rocks
[1:07:58] before God so then how shall he take us
[1:08:01] to
[1:08:02] the take us on the
[1:08:05] basis of his good
[1:08:07] works amen what is his good work his
[1:08:12] good work on the
[1:08:13] cross the shedding of the blood which is
[1:08:17] shed if your Works can serve
[1:08:20] you Jesus died in
[1:08:23] vain but I'm so
[1:08:26] Jesus did not die in vain he died that I
[1:08:30] might have life and have life more
[1:08:33] abund he died that he may save me he
[1:08:37] died that he may bring the word and I
[1:08:40] may receive the word and I may eat and
[1:08:43] feast on the body word of
[1:08:47] the he died that I might be able to make
[1:08:50] it on the basis of the blood
[1:08:55] not on my own Works where do my Works
[1:08:59] come
[1:09:00] in my Works come in because I have a
[1:09:04] revelation of who I am when I know who I
[1:09:08] am I cannot do the evil
[1:09:11] works I cannot do the bad
[1:09:14] works the things I used to do I do them
[1:09:17] no
[1:09:18] more why because I know I'm born
[1:09:21] again because I Know Who I Am The Works
[1:09:25] I do do I do them because of the
[1:09:27] Revelation I
[1:09:30] have when you know you are a son of a
[1:09:33] king you cannot behave like a poor
[1:09:36] man the moment you know your father is a
[1:09:40] king even before you have a
[1:09:42] coin you will start walking
[1:09:45] different you will start talking
[1:09:48] different if people can go to
[1:09:50] America and they change their talking
[1:09:53] and they begin talking no no
[1:09:57] how about when you know you a son of
[1:10:00] aing oh brother sister you are talking
[1:10:03] will change your life will change your
[1:10:07] behavior will change your culture will
[1:10:09] change your dress will change come on
[1:10:13] Church everything about you it will
[1:10:16] change because you now have a revelation
[1:10:20] of what the blood has done for you have
[1:10:24] a revelation that you are a son of a
[1:10:27] king you a daughter of a king when you
[1:10:31] receive that Revelation you begin
[1:10:33] behaving different you are saying I'm a
[1:10:36] royal
[1:10:37] priesthood I am a holy nation Hallelujah
[1:10:41] I no longer I cannot reduce
[1:10:45] that you say byebye to be
[1:10:48] a you say byebye to
[1:10:51] clubs you say byebye to
[1:10:53] fornication amen
[1:10:56] why because you have a
[1:10:58] revelation of who you are but none of
[1:11:01] what we
[1:11:02] do can purchase a
[1:11:05] Salvation I am purchased
[1:11:08] already amen I am the product of the the
[1:11:13] blood
[1:11:15] purchased I am the
[1:11:17] purchase of the blood of
[1:11:20] Jes Oh Glory to God there is no power in
[1:11:24] here no power on Earth no power in the
[1:11:28] of Darkness can hinder me from being Who
[1:11:32] I Am from being who the word said
[1:11:36] be why because the word has already
[1:11:40] purchased me the word has already
[1:11:44] declared you shall be perfect you shall
[1:11:47] be in the image of God you will bring
[1:11:50] forth His
[1:11:52] Image the Bible says we don't know how
[1:11:55] we will be but we know when he comes we
[1:11:59] shall be like him why shall we be like
[1:12:02] him because we will be in His
[1:12:05] image the word of God changes us into
[1:12:10] the image of God you don't see the
[1:12:12] change
[1:12:13] happening you don't hear it
[1:12:16] happening Oh Glory you don't feel it
[1:12:19] happening but the more you sit under the
[1:12:22] preaching of the
[1:12:23] word the changes
[1:12:26] happening something is happening on the
[1:12:28] inside and one of these days you begin
[1:12:32] to see yourself
[1:12:33] difference your appetite
[1:12:36] changes a pregnant woman does not know
[1:12:39] what she
[1:12:40] wants but what she knows is she wants
[1:12:44] what she
[1:12:45] wants why because she's pregnant
[1:12:49] something on the inside of is pulling
[1:12:52] for something else something on the
[1:12:55] inside of our heart is pulling for the
[1:12:58] word is pulling for some vitamins from
[1:13:02] the revealed word of the hour that's why
[1:13:04] when we hear the word we become excited
[1:13:08] when we hear the word we become happy we
[1:13:12] become
[1:13:13] energized why because something on the
[1:13:16] inside of us is feeding on
[1:13:20] the hallelujah hallelujah amen praise
[1:13:24] the name of the Lord
[1:13:25] Lord and so we see we are going to
[1:13:30] resurrect we will rise up from the
[1:13:33] gra to meet the Lord in the
[1:13:36] a
[1:13:38] amen so now all those whose names were
[1:13:40] not on the Book of
[1:13:43] Life they will be cast in the Lake of
[1:13:46] Fire we are not talking about the second
[1:13:49] Resurrection someone told me what about
[1:13:53] the names of the Bride
[1:13:55] where are they well I said that in the
[1:13:58] Book of
[1:13:59] Life said do we have two books of
[1:14:02] life I said no we have one book of life
[1:14:06] but you see the the names of the Bride
[1:14:10] are in another
[1:14:13] compartment in the book of
[1:14:17] life that
[1:14:19] compartment has something on
[1:14:22] it no entrance
[1:14:25] for any non
[1:14:28] member the only
[1:14:30] requirement to enter that
[1:14:33] comp is
[1:14:37] predestination by faith by grace through
[1:14:40] the
[1:14:41] blood I'm
[1:14:43] confused how come it is the
[1:14:46] blood and yet was
[1:14:49] predestinated that is what it means to
[1:14:51] reserve or to be reserved
[1:14:53] [Music]
[1:14:55] he knew me before I even
[1:14:58] was oh Hallelujah am he planned my life
[1:15:03] he knew my
[1:15:05] destination before I even
[1:15:07] started and he began planning
[1:15:10] everything amen and he gave me a free
[1:15:14] moral agent Amen to be able to decide
[1:15:18] and he knew I will decide in the
[1:15:21] favor of entering that compartment
[1:15:26] by believing his
[1:15:27] word and so he ministered an
[1:15:31] entrance for me and for you to the
[1:15:35] others what do we see in the
[1:15:37] Bible the Bible says in the Book of
[1:15:41] Genesis the moment man
[1:15:43] sinned there was two
[1:15:46] angels I don't know how many maybe I
[1:15:48] think there were
[1:15:49] two they were blessed on the way they
[1:15:52] were blessed on on the east
[1:15:55] gate to protect the way to the tree of
[1:16:01] life the way to the tree of life but the
[1:16:05] bride through the death of Jesus Christ
[1:16:09] on the cross what does the bride do the
[1:16:12] bride hears it and believes
[1:16:15] it what is that the you believe the
[1:16:19] prophet says you have heard from your
[1:16:23] the what does that means it
[1:16:26] means these angels literally release
[1:16:33] you and the
[1:16:35] way the to the tree of life is directly
[1:16:39] ministered to
[1:16:41] you the permission is
[1:16:44] granted by a Royal
[1:16:47] Decree by a royal
[1:16:50] gr no man can stop you to walk that way
[1:16:56] Oh My My My and that way no one can walk
[1:17:00] up there but the pure
[1:17:02] in amen and when you walk that way you
[1:17:06] are sure you are going to eat from the
[1:17:08] Tree of Life and now the Bible says to
[1:17:12] they that shall
[1:17:13] overcome I will give of them to eat from
[1:17:17] the Tree of Life what does it mean we
[1:17:21] have ministered we have been ministered
[1:17:24] we have
[1:17:26] into the way oh what is the way the way
[1:17:30] is Jesus the way is the message and by
[1:17:33] receiving this message we are walking on
[1:17:36] that way we are eating of the tree amen
[1:17:40] right now we have eternal
[1:17:44] lifeu we have eternal life we cannot
[1:17:49] perish just like God cannot
[1:17:51] perish if I will perish that means God
[1:17:55] can perish but I know God cannot perish
[1:17:59] that means I cannot perish I know God is
[1:18:03] eternal that means I'm Eternal I am here
[1:18:06] on Earth to represent his
[1:18:12] attributes amen friends this these
[1:18:16] things just spark off your heart when
[1:18:18] you
[1:18:19] hear amen it just opens up well of
[1:18:27] water it opens up
[1:18:30] something you did not know that was
[1:18:33] actually in
[1:18:35] existence it oh hallelujah amen amen
[1:18:39] this young man sent me this John
[1:18:41] 4:13 Jesus answered and said unto her
[1:18:45] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[1:18:48] thir again the Waters of
[1:18:51] theology the Waters of denomination
[1:18:55] oh Hallelujah shall thir again that's
[1:18:58] why they hope from church to
[1:19:00] church they can never be satisfied but
[1:19:04] whosoever drink of the
[1:19:06] water I who Jesus the word shall give
[1:19:11] him shall never fast but the water that
[1:19:15] I shall give him shall be in him in him
[1:19:20] a well of
[1:19:22] water bringing up
[1:19:25] into everlasting
[1:19:28] life oh Hallelujah we have received that
[1:19:31] well of
[1:19:32] water by receiving the word we have
[1:19:36] within us this message which we have
[1:19:40] received is a well of water in US it can
[1:19:43] never run dry there is more there is
[1:19:48] more keep opening your
[1:19:50] heart God has more for you
[1:19:54] tell your neighbor God has more for you
[1:19:56] brother
[1:19:57] s praise the name of the
[1:20:00] Lord praise
[1:20:03] God so we now face the
[1:20:05] question as to why they should be given
[1:20:08] eternal life at the Judgment these
[1:20:14] people since the Epistles seem to
[1:20:16] conclusively point out that one must
[1:20:19] possess the spirit of Christ or perish
[1:20:30] though it seems th we must not discreet
[1:20:33] the words of Jesus who most pointedly
[1:20:35] set forth that there are some found in
[1:20:37] the Book of Life who will ever either
[1:20:39] receive eternal life before the general
[1:20:42] Resurrection or after
[1:20:53] ites not evade this Truth for he most
[1:20:56] clearly says in Philippians 311 if by
[1:20:59] any means I might attain unto the
[1:21:01] resurrection of
[1:21:09] the now this statement is most
[1:21:12] peculiar we all know that we are all
[1:21:15] going to be in a
[1:21:19] resurrection whether we want to be or
[1:21:23] not we are all going to be a part of
[1:21:28] Resurrection so if I say are you going
[1:21:30] to be
[1:21:32] resurrected and you don't say Amen it
[1:21:35] doesn't matter you will be in a
[1:21:38] resurrection the question is which
[1:21:41] Resurrection for the bride it will be
[1:21:43] the first
[1:21:45] resurrection and for the general
[1:21:48] Resurrection those who did not or were
[1:21:50] not part of the
[1:21:52] Bride will all come and be a part of
[1:21:59] so Paul could hardly be saying if by any
[1:22:01] means I might attain to a resurrection
[1:22:03] of the
[1:22:09] Dead th path
[1:22:13] throughout the
[1:22:15] Universe
