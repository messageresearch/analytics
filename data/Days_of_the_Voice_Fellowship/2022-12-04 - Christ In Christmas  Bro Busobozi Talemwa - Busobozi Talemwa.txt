ceremony yeah and they're going to get married on 10th December at the church so you are all invited go and be a part of that okay now I know that we are going into uh we are already in December and December is a very busy man you know now we are very much connected most of you are already on social media and you are seeing a lot of invitations but I also believe that we should always be guided by our pastors don't always run to wherever you are invited you must always receive guidance not everywhere you are going you will you will get food since praise the Lord but we have a lot of invitations even now as I came in I just received one that I had not seen before to YouTube so I don't know whether you will conflict with our programs but we'll look at it but from 22nd to 26th of this month we have uh two conventions and they are all believers conventions myself and a few of you have always been a part of the convention in Kenya [Music] um during that time this is usually called Christmas meetings so this time again they have invited us to go and be a part of those meetings anyone that has a national ID and a pass or a passport you can be able to go to those meetings foreign [Music] [Music] so I'll be going to both by God's grace [Music] but you all are welcome to go to both as well or to whichever that you will feel led to go to beating in Uganda is usually in theater is it called Saturn Hill College it's a resident meeting so when you go there you get accommodation at the school again 22nd 26th so on Wednesday 21st to 23rd myself I'll be going to Kenya in Japanese to to minister on 24th in this set a convention and also on 26th the meeting so I'm going to preach the last meeting and also one on 20 24th which is a Saturday because of these two programs and also because we all can be a part of that meeting I did not find it necessary for us to open our church during that time so on the Sunday of 25th that is which is going to be the Christmas Day I am asking all of us to go and participate in that meeting my name is we shall not have a service here so don't come and also inform others to go in that meeting foreign but that meeting or that convention you have to pay to get there one hundred and forty thousand it is to the younger people the youth so if you have the money and they want to go and be a part of it I'd like to let you know you are free to go yeah that is from 29th to First January I hope you're writing this somewhere those of you who are planning to participate in this meetings um now I spoke about our business meeting we usually hear in this church we have our annual business meeting we just made to tell you about what your money has been doing that you have been giving throughout the year uh we have to account to you because you give it and also we have a project that we are currently running that is the our uh Churchland funds and I think at this time I can also give you an update um noticed that since we moved here is those of you who were on fire giving daily and weekly you just stopped um I think when you arrived here you thought you have now bought the Churchland we have not bought the church lands and we have not arrived yet in the business meeting I'll talk more details only a handful of names and these are recording names and most of them are actually members of my my family that is myself and then also uh brother calebu and brother Peter burganda Peter um brother Solomon also gave something on November 3rd burgundy Solomon those are the only names I've seen since October first okay October 1st yes if you've given anything since October first and I've not talked about you that means we never received it and um brother Tim brother Tim Dort came and visited us here all again the team uh he was his time was short so he didn't have time to minister uh to us this time but when he came and his wife and my family the family we were able to meet him Brother Martin Thomas thinking he had a little Fellowship foreign books that we supply to the whole country also across the borders Ethiopia and also to to Rwanda so those Brothers sponsor the pepper and some of you here contribute your time you volunteer to print that but they come Fatima teams and when he came here he was surprised and he was moved you know the other Church where we were can you say he went right I think it was just half of this section those of you who don't know that mother just a section there outside so um he was moved and he was impressed how far we have gone yeah and I want to say and to let you know that he also contributed 1.4 million a um I think that is so far the only money we have received from someone from another country from another country to support our calls but that together with everything we've contributed since September 19th of last year [Music] you remember the person who gave the very fast my [Music] and uh I want to tell you we have we are not stuck with the vision but from what I'm saying here I think many of you every day I know that it's not been easy in these past few months but I believe you can surely do much better than this I will reserve my comments and most of the details in our business meeting but I want to say to that we've given a total of 29 Millions 149 000. now some of that when we were moving here we we used it to do a few things here but like I said we will talk about the details in the business meeting praise the Lord praise the Lord um we also so on Friday 30th December Friday that is we usually have a Friday night service but we will instead have a business meeting today [Music] so that is on Friday 30th we shall keep reminding you how many are looking forward to our uh New Year's Fellowship that we usually have foreign [Music] cross over the year together now I'm rejoicing together so you are all welcome and if you want to contribute towards the good resting feel free to come and let us know it's going to be a wonderful time and we also had some prayer for the people for needs I've had many people who have told me their needs were met and let us challenge God together I believe he will meet all our needs foreign from around the 21st of January I Believe by that time we shall still have the holiday the students will be around so I'll tell you more about that in the coming days they're inviting us to they are on your convention next year [Music] which will be in January 19th [Music] January so incidentally it is falling on our youth meeting as well praise the Lord this morning I'm going to speak on a rare subject I think we don't usually speak about this kind of subjects you know Christ in Christmas our friends God bless you you are all welcome I saw I saw brother uh amen [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] I'm glad to be given an opportunity to stand before you democracy I'm a full Christian and I'm a pastor District I come from even the district a town and that is the town [Music] I wanted to come here [Music] Pastor thank you so much I just told him he did not inform us that he was coming otherwise we would have loved to hear him foreign let us sing Joy to the World aliens no no that's a very high key for me that's a very high key for me give me a little lower on brother Peter wants cartoon [Music] [Music] their songs and Blues foreign [Music] [Music] the ground he comes to foreign [Music] oh joy to the wildest Lord is [Music] one more time amen Joy to the wild the Lord is [Music] I see let us pray Lord Jesus we know it is a reality that one day you were born in a manger okay that is [Music] [Music] I pray that we will recognize you this morning and as we speak on this rare subject Christ in Christmas at the end of this service give me inspiration let your Holy Spirit [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] I'm just praying that the Lord will count me down and uh so I don't just go over the things but be sensitively his spirit [Music] and if we don't get done maybe we'll just carry on on Wednesday probably about time this is the month they say that Jesus was born of course we know that is not true um okay so those are the things I want us to deal with I said it's a rare subject and this is one that actually shocks a lot of people when they get to realize it if there is one thing that is really so bad is nothing as bad as tradition we Slowly by slowly and the truth sometimes and many times is actually replaced with tradition Al and when you tell somebody a tradition is not true they will disfellowship with you they will disconnect themselves from you and they will say you have a first doctor like you know when we tell people that the Trinity is a Doctrine from hell it's a Catholic Doctrine it has nothing to do with the Bible oh they will frown at you they will tell you what because the Trinity has been preached as a major Christian doctrine for centuries but last Sunday we dealt with that next Sunday we were able to find out there is nothing like a trinity or person there is only eternity of a person what do you that manifests himself in three different manifestations [Music] but then they said father is God's son is God and holy spirit is God and each of them is independent um but that is not true there is nothing like an eternal son because to be an eternal son you have to be without beginning and without ending [Music] but we know that Jesus at the beginning and then we also found that there are people who try to make Jesus father son holy spirit so we found out that is not true we dealt with that on Sunday will not go back you can go and listen to that someone is called the unrecognized Christ so this morning we are going to deal with Christ in Christmas now I know among the message circles they don't even Christmas is one of the words that is they're so allergic too much because everybody else in the world is you know 25th December is a great day they cook good food they shop wonderful things because of that or Rachel many Believers I don't know where they got that from men decided even to eat beans because they want to look different we should not do something because we want to look different and I want to thank God because we have a guide the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit uses men and women Bible but we thank God for the prophet of this hour foreign we will read from verses 1 to 7. and it came to pass in those days that they went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed and this taxing was first made once tyrannius was governor of Syria and all and all went to be taxed everyone into his own City and Joseph also went up From Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea and to the city of David which is called Bethlehem because he was the he was of the house and lineage of David to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child and so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered and she brought forth her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a Manger because there was no room for them in the Inn again [Music] [Music] [Music] because there was no room for them in the inner [Music] negative can we repeat that again everyone now because there was no room for them in the air amen you may be seated now in the message the acts of the Holy Spirit the prophet of God says now as we are approaching Christmas time now and here the things are decorated all up with Santa Claus instead of Jesus you know Santa Claus Santa Claus who knows Santa Claus Santa Cruz all right you know that that big man with red onion something white around with big I don't know how exactly I can describe but he's called Father Christmas you know he's everywhere and all over you know and they're decorating that you know and instead of Jesus we are approaching Christmas foreign [Music] and instead of rejoicing under the spirit of God they go out and get drunk and rejoice and listen to me the prophet of God says here that is what makes the difference foreign [Music] [Music] they get drunk but and then they Rejoice so I want to ask you a question why are they rejoicing is it because of the mouth of Christopher because of the alcohol what is the celebration about from the beginning the birth of Jesus Christ was not celebrated from the beginning we've read it together you know it was time the time of taxing Charities and the emperor had given an order Joseph you know the story of Joseph and Maryam how Joseph was espoused engaged with Mary history and then she he found one day he woke up and found his girlfriend pregnant and you know there is only one reason that a man can divorce a wife praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord if that girl um fornicated as a matter of fact Jesus himself when he came yesterday he said If any man um divorces his wife and marriage accept it before the cause of fornication um now listen let me explain that a little more so there is a difference between fornication and adultery no Wednesday right fornication is allocating living is immorality before marriage done by somebody who is married there is no such a divorce in the Bible brother you can catch already [Music] but you can't divorce if you want to divorce and he will she will remain because she is your wife does not warrant divorce so how can a married woman foreign [Music] [Music] go back because they never married to begin with marriage must be made on the basis of good faith or before on Truth praise the name of the Lord so if there is a lie in it and she did not disclose his life to him and he finds out later and she that means that he can put her away that means you should when you are going to get married before you accept to be married you must confess your life to him just like we confess our life to Jesus [Music] so here we find out that Joseph was engaged with Mary YouTube Mary was a virgin Mary but later on Joseph finds out that Mary is pregnant she must have lied to me [Music] in the public so he wanted to leave her but privately and we notice that Jesus yes was not made out of the egg of Mary yes but he actually came from the word of God yes he himself was the word Dua praise the name of the Lord and so now Joseph carries on with his wife [Music] and he said okay let us now raise this child and one day they have gone to do the taxing with Mary the Maryam and Mary was about to deliver Mariam was in the late stages of the pregnancies and while they were there the Bible says the days were accomplished we shall come back to this but I want to ask you how many days does a woman take to deliver um foreign foreign because there was listen now to this because there was no room for them in the inner Jesus yes are you hearing me church was born yes tell someone Jesus was born listen to this the day he was born was actually not celebrated did they celebrate it as a matter of fact when Mary was going to give back she went to the uh with Joseph to try and find just a room where Jesus where Jesus will be born yes but everybody told them sorry we are busy they must I'm sure they must have gone in almost every place if they were the only available places for the savior of the world be born let alone celebrate his birth foreign did not celebrate it but nothing eventually the Romans the national leaders they did not celebrate it the family of both Mary even the family [Music] you don't know what we are talking about do you not giving birth to a child is not celebrating it means it is you know children you know children are joy in the home and you know even whenever a girl even becomes pregnant without being married you know many people will not celebrate the birth of a child and to banjo your money but at least foreign [Music] [Music] so they thought they were outcasts study by himself so they left them aside they didn't even have a place for Jesus to be born so they decided to go out there and in a Manger where a sheep is born a despised place that is the only place where they found rooms Jesus was born yes hallelujah amen but there was no one woman two years from the political fraternities or something else it is evident from The Works they do not celebrate questions not our Christopher this I will prove to you in a few moments because the Bible in the book of second Timothy chapter 3 verse in the last days for men shall be listen man shall be [Music] loverselves disobedient to their parents in our generation you give somebody something and they say only this is [Music] question say my hand will be so so bad the condition will be worse would have come from good to worse men will be traitors then he says there will be lovers or Pleasures more than lovers of God man in our generation they want pleasure I always see you know at home you know one day I was just thinking about it you know on the screen I was putting certain things for my children I know foreign foreign [Music] are the form of godliness [Music] are you hearing me now in the days of the birth of Jesus can we say that our generation is better praise our generation loves Jesus there is a form of godliness you can't find you can realize it together when I tell you people are not worshiping uh celebrating the birth of Christ not actually point to the fact that they are celebrating the birth of Christ that is a form of God do you know what the power is the world the power is the gospel the Bible says in the Book of Romans why because it is and this gospel is the power I am not ashamed to carry my Bible this is why I tell my friends about Jesus tell people I believe in Jesus Christ is the most sinful day on Earth hey what is wrong with you Pastor today I'm saying the truth even people over here and probably literally they leave church in the early morning and they go to bars why today is our day it is Christmas anymore they have removed Christ because there is nothing about Jesus Christ and then they bring their father Christmas Connection does he have with the Bible Father Christmas in the Bible I want to say to you days of the voice hallelujah amen let us put Christ back in Christmas hallelujah amen they say they are celebrating his boss foreign and their father will go again [Applause] [Music] nothing to do with Jesus Christi let us tell our children of Jesus as a matter of fact the Bible does not tell us to celebrate the birth of Christ if we celebrate our own birthdays remember the Bible never told us I want to say this to you as the true bride of Christ kind of people to celebrate the birth of Christ amen in the right way [Music] is not a celebration it is a worship it is through deception they have depressed Christ with X crystal is clearly this is just a form of godliness let me show you the two celebrations praise the name of the Lord and there and they were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field keeping watch over their flock by night and Lord the angel of the Lord Came Upon them and the glory of the Lord Shone right about them and they were so afraid and the angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy Hallelujah we shall be to all people read that Lucas is all right I mean yes amen I want you to see how Jesus one should receive his birth yes Jesus did not go to the priests yesterday against he did not go to the to the king say again he didn't even go to the damn churches but where did he go by infestation of angels he went to the Shepherds where was Jesus born yes yes so he went to the Shepherds who understand the manger I mean hallelujah amen so you went to the supper they were at the lowest sized people of their time even today [Music] what is the shepherdachi you know when you go to the Village you find them you know having a road stinking clothes is smelling cows having that you know just you know having even the belly dressing and then you know you're just you know going with the cows [Music] yeah no so when you really pass a Shepherd wood you look down you look down on them oh poor fellas shepherds are not great people just like Lambs something was happening May one way to get in the mass what was being born that day was the lamb did not need the religious people hallelujah amen and when the angel of the Lord came down and light the glory of the Lord Shone around about them and the angel said unto them fear for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people front to you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior did you hear that or you did not you is born this day for the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord now many people they think that those wise men they came on the day Jesus was born [Music] the wise man they came between one another and two years after the birth of Jesus [Music] you remember that after they left but I'm out of fire and the King wanted to kill the children because he wanted to kill Jesus killed everyone two years and below because Jesus at that time was in that age group but the people around that made the birth of Jesus on the same day Christo and this shall be assigned unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped in swaddling clothe is lying in a Manger okay and suddenly there was with the angel of multitude of the Heavenly Host praising God and saying glory to God in their eyes and on the earth peace Good Will toward men and it was it has it and it came to pass us the Angels were gone away from them into heaven the shepherd said unto one another let us now go even unto Bethlehem and see this thing which is come to pass which the Lord has made known unto us and they came with haste and upon Mary and Joseph and the Babe lying in a manger and when they had seen it they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child and all that they had and all they that had it wandered orders at those things which were told them by the Shepherds but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in our heart and the Shepherds returned glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had had and seen as it was told unto them now I want you to see several things here one way of interview with everyone number one that the news or the message of his birth was ministered by an Angel not Santa [Music] is not going to be administered by a priest [Music] by some religious order um really the first three chapters of the Seven Angels Came in every age to be clear at the birth of Jesus was the Declaration of the birth of Jesus of course in this case it is a spiritual declaration because it's not the Jesus that was born at that time we are looking for now yeah foreign the message will always come to the vilest of sinners the message from the angel told them that Jesus was in a Manger the most unexpected place for him to be 84. the manger is droppings of sheep and everything smelly yeah [Music] they went to see him I want to say we have come to see by hearing and reading they met Jesus with exceeding Joy yes we receive the holy ghosts unspeakable I'm full of Glory Christ in US Christians of our resurrection and they made it known abroad when they had that we do also must prophesy again to tell the testimony of Christ actually that is the true Christmas story now if you missed it you'll go back and listen to them now foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] than their names how many systems are there autumn in the winter all right now Four Seasons God bless you Elizabeth now that in which season was Jesus when alarm was born foreign foreign go ahead um [Music] amen Amina when did the angel come Mariah which is I want a very good mathematics student yes foreign first of all I want to ask you this is a student and this is reality so we want to find out how many months does a woman take um for the pregnancy to become to be foreign foreign the seventh um July August September October July August September October November December December now listen to me would not know when which date the too many questions and you don't know when in March beginning if it's beginning of June maybe it's around late much it's the end of June then the the due date would be around the airport but the death of his birth becomes between March and April is everybody understands that my name is becomes much or apple um in December December it is winter and no Lambs can be born yes you might be a Catholic and they believe Jesus was born on 25th December I have a question for you was Jesus born as a premature yes was he put into a woman the Bible already has told us in Luke chapter 2 verse 6. that easy to say of Jesus being born yes the Bible did not say oh because Joseph and Mary were walking yes the pregnancy went upside down if Jesus was born on 25th December but according to the Bible Bible he had full time he had to have full time be a hundred percent a month in Israel are usually born around that time even when you see when Jesus was born they wanted a Manger there was no snow but whenever you see people celebrating Christmas during snow time why did they choose that day that debt was already there before the birth of Jesus and they were already celebrating the other gods of December and our Jesus he's actually born yesterday in the springtime God bless you thank you for opening my eyes of Jesus [Applause] but now as it is they have completely there is no Christ it's about other gods [Music] giving all those kind of gifts of alcohol and they go out naked fornication Christmas it's not even Christmas anymore because the Christ they're celebrating is not ourselves put back Christ in Christmas they are celebrating their own Christ have our Christmas we must tell our children have a favorite story what is wrong with food a military coach we must have wonderful food because our Jesus Christ he was born yes anyone was he born on 25th yesterday he wasn't they are very well I can choose to celebrate Christ even today what is wrong with that attention the queen had two best days yeah one I think was I don't know I don't know how they call it would be the official one and then her real birthday and like you yourself my birthday is on the 15th of May this is recently my mother told me that that was that's the wrong date laughs that that that's that's the one she told me at first and then recently destroyed me it was another one they forgotten again I mean praise the name of Allah but I celebrated he doesn't make me another person the issue here is what is what are you doing what are you worshiping how many he had decorate on their birthdays foreign [Music] foreign gifts on their birthdays we have a meeting I don't remember the first the day I also had ever had a gift I can't remember but I'll sure be happy to get one man yes sir so now find out Zula that Jesus was not born 25 seconds it is not wrong to Worship in the right way and remember the birth of Jesus Jesus Christ hallelujah amen praise the name of Allah in the deity of Jesus Christ we are today all over the world is being celebrated of the birth of Jesus and he says which now is just traditional government no he says it's just traditional Jesus was not born on the December the 25th yesterday the hills of judeaf was full of snow at that time so how could it be remember that the Shepherds were they are grazing their sheep no you're not in the snow spring pie so you see Jesus commonly by astrology so forth and by all of it was born first around the first of April yesterday so when it was time and she said but this is a day listen to me but this is December which is all right just set aside to watch any Memorial of his coming to the world [Music] one of the greatest gifts that God ever give to the world was Jesus Christ giving themselves those kind of gifts we are going to give us ourselves the gifts Chicago oh dear now you're a prophet received the Bible on Christmas [Music] he had a Christmas tree in his house and then the little children you can't expect they can't understand [Music] you have Revelation they don't or you know and then he would put the gifts under there and and you know they would come and pick it up and they would be so happy that it would make their time of telling his children because my time is done but I will just have most of these I'll share them some of them on Wednesday if I feel late if not I'll just post it on the chat group and you can all right let me read a little more for you in Divine Healing he says and the fact of all the era and everything there is about there is something about it that the world tries to make it an Xmas moving to the Xmas he says and the fact of all the errors and everything there is about it in this thing there is something about it that the world tries to make it an X-Men is that the the error is is really the world Mexican [Music] but God has still got a Christmas in need Christmas somewhere I went to our house hasn't he he saw us he's got something about it justice the very names and the thoughts of the birth of the Lord Jesus Oh the world has put Santa Claus in his place but not the Christians still a Christmas a child Christmas that's what your Prophet says Christianity is still a Christmas we have not done it as a next month removed Christ we shall not remove replace him with Santa Claus Santa Claus praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Christmas is the day of worship Christmas the prophet says and let me read another here in Christianity versus idolatry says Christmas is no more a worship Christmas is a celebration gambling arousing just Pagan to the limit for God feed your resources maybe after Christmas I'll speak again on Christmas so it won't deprive the little meaning of the children but you can't tell that that to little children like that they see little fellows on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that so they can't understand it who is a very holy brother Merry Christmas and he's seeing the other children received no wonder very many young children who were raised by parents who believe the message they didn't follow what the prophet said are you hearing me Church fathers who are here mothers were here it's all right to give your gifts to your children on Christmas is perfectly all right but you can't tell that to leave the children like that they silly the fellows on Christmas night getting Christmas presents and things like that they don't understand it again and you've got to remember them they have things in common we've got to bring ourselves down to remember them little fellas praise the name of the Lord in Psalms we would see Jesus they have taken the sacredness from Christmas to make it not a Christmas day of Celebration we do not you hear people say we are going to Celebration we are going to celebrate Christmas what is wrong we should never celebrate Christmas is a day of worship Christmas Hallelujah but looking back on my life I wonder where it happened from them little Christmas says when we hung up our stockings and Mama would get would probably get an orange and two or three little pieces of stripped candy and that was a great Christmas to us Christmas but you know kids they look forward to the to those to them gifts we find out that that Christmas is is uh to the is mainly children that they look forward to that foreign and I can go on and on and on and on praise the name of the Lord I want to thank that lady I can't think of her name Billy just told me
