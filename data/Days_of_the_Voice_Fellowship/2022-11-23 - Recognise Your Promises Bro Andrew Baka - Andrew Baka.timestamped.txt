[44:49] and behold
[44:51] there was a man in Jerusalem
[44:55] whose name was Simeon
[44:59] and the same man was just and devote
[45:03] waiting for the consolation of Israel
[45:07] and the Holy Ghost was upon him
[45:11] and it was revealed unto him by the holy
[45:14] spirit that he shall not
[45:17] see this
[45:19] before he had seen the Lord is Christ
[45:24] and he came by the spirit into the
[45:26] temple
[45:27] and when the parents brought
[45:30] in the Child Jesus
[45:33] to do for him after the custom of the
[45:35] law
[45:36] then took he
[45:39] him up in his arms
[45:41] and blessed God and said
[45:45] Lord
[45:47] now let it thou
[45:50] thy servant depart in peace according to
[45:54] Thy Word
[45:55] for my eyes

[48:28] a declaration or an assurance
[48:34] that one will do something
[48:39] all that a particular thing happens
[48:49] declaration or an assurance that one
[48:52] will do something
[48:58] it can mean a commitment
[49:01] foreign
[49:21] by

[51:22] promise
[51:28] of you
[51:30] ubanga
[51:33] you cannot recognize your promises
[51:38] until
[51:41] you know where it is coming from you
[51:44] can't recognize your personal attack
[51:51] um
[51:52] and another thing
[51:59] is
[52:03] change into
[52:05] I mean single money
[52:09] if you know the person who made the
[52:12] promise to you and or money back up
[52:15] around here and then you know about his
[52:17] background
[52:23] it may bring you confidence and
[52:26] stability in you to know whether the
[52:28] promise will come to pass or not yes
[52:31] we're together
[52:35] you can acknowledge that if it is
[52:39] Andrew's promise it will come to pass
[52:42] however normal
[52:47] or some other way you can say if that
[52:51] promise is from Andrew I don't want to
[52:54] waste my time so true is now we have
[52:58] learned from the word that um
[53:03] got a promise
[53:05] from God
[53:08] the Lord appeared to him and told him
[53:13] that you will not die
[53:15] before you see the Savior hallelujah
[53:19] amen
[53:20] you will not see this until you're
[53:24] saying Christ
[53:30] that was a promise and it was a very
[53:34] very great promise
[53:51] and he walked right with God
[54:02] we learn a lot of things
[54:05] it is okay one of them
[54:12] when we wait in faith we will see our
[54:15] promises
[54:21] when we wait in faith
[54:27] Hallelujah Amina
[54:30] the Bible says that wait without wax is
[54:34] dead
[54:40] even the prophet talked about it in his
[54:43] message
[54:44] faith without what is dead
[55:03] let us see this quote where the Prophet
[55:06] said this statement that faith without
[55:09] works is the robot that forgets
[55:13] but because of time we shall not read
[55:16] there but let me try to expound what
[55:17] took place
[55:20] one day the prophet was preaching
[55:23] again now he was having a prayer line
[55:30] a young man came around
[55:33] um
[55:34] the boy was dating what is getting
[55:39] foreign
[56:03] and and Prophet told him do you believe
[56:06] the Lord
[56:09] again
[56:22] after some
[56:24] within that service he came back and
[56:26] said
[56:27] he came and told the prophet but you
[56:30] told me that if I go home if I go I
[56:33] shall be well but I'm still begetting
[56:40] again
[56:44] the prophet told him but you believe
[56:49] then the boy said yes
[56:59] so after some time the boy came back
[57:04] it will
[57:08] not believe
[57:10] it is
[57:15] I believe that now
[57:21] in the message the boy went home and and
[57:24] the prophet went somewhere to preach in
[57:26] another country
[57:31] so when the boy went home
[57:36] he went with this one so when he reached
[57:38] home he said I am well yeah
[57:44] he would always speak I got healed in
[57:47] the name of Allah
[57:58] is wrong they both said the prophet told
[58:00] me that I will be healed
[58:03] in the name of Jesus I'm Healed
[58:11] the child everywhere they see she
[58:14] hold them here
[58:24] we are saying um
[58:30] one day
[58:32] even the visitors were still around
[58:36] and and the Vista said
[58:39] I I would imagine such a preacher who
[58:43] would tell uh this boy such words
[58:53] he deserves
[59:02] I am healed the Wonder the boy came in
[59:05] the morning when they were there and
[59:06] shouted
[59:10] the boys
[59:16] they took him to the doctor they checked
[59:19] him um
[59:20] and the doctor said the child is okay
[59:25] um
[59:27] they took the boy to the church where he
[59:30] wished to fellowship and they said the
[59:31] boy is well so do you see do you see
[59:34] that faith
[59:36] that is faced with actions
[59:53] the boy believed and he did all
[59:56] corresponding actions to his faith
[1:00:00] amen men and the boy got healed
[1:00:10] so in Waiting upon the Lord we must have
[1:00:12] hope
[1:00:17] God proves his word
[1:00:24] there is no
[1:00:29] ability he proves his word yes
[1:00:32] what you do is to wait upon him in faith
[1:00:38] a
[1:00:40] however you recognize the promise money
[1:00:47] immune knew that he will see the Savior
[1:00:52] and
[1:00:56] I trust that he could pray yes
[1:01:05] hallelujah amen
[1:01:08] and his Hope was not blessed in a man
[1:01:10] it's not a circumstance
[1:01:12] [Music]
[1:01:15] no he placed his hope in God
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:20] so we should learn to praise our hope in
[1:01:24] God and we should never lose hope
[1:01:31] if you recognize your promise and God
[1:01:33] promised you believe us we have so many
[1:01:36] promised this book the word of the Lord
[1:01:39] is full of promises
[1:01:49] um so the promise may may have a Time
[1:01:52] bound others may not have a Time
[1:02:06] somebody may give you a promise that
[1:02:11] means that God told Abraham that you
[1:02:13] shall have a child
[1:02:18] no he never told him
[1:02:22] the man was old
[1:02:26] he was very very old
[1:02:29] we shall see it in the message proving
[1:02:32] his word
[1:02:35] Abraham was very old
[1:02:40] amen I mean but God
[1:02:44] with the captain wow
[1:02:57] Hallelujah
[1:02:58] remember they're looking for it
[1:03:11] he proves God proves his word
[1:03:15] he proves his promise
[1:03:20] Abraham in his age
[1:03:23] the prophet says
[1:03:27] notice it was unscientific
[1:03:32] science
[1:03:36] for a man of a hundred years old
[1:03:40] foreign
[1:03:44] [Music]
[1:03:51] [Music]
[1:04:12] it's impossible go to the hospital and
[1:04:15] make ready for that for the mother to
[1:04:17] have the baby again
[1:04:21] or whatever it would be if you want to
[1:04:24] compare it with this age
[1:04:30] they would call him he
[1:04:34] is out of his mind
[1:04:35] but God said
[1:04:38] in God said and he the Bible said in
[1:04:41] Romans 4 chapter in Romans 4 that
[1:04:46] Abraham staggered not at the promise of
[1:04:50] God
[1:05:02] giving praise to God
[1:05:05] for he endeavored as
[1:05:08] as seeing him who is invisible
[1:05:16] and was satisfied
[1:05:18] on holding fast for he was fully
[1:05:21] persuaded that God that what God
[1:05:24] promised
[1:05:25] foreign
[1:06:00] and the salad to become
[1:06:03] a young woman
[1:06:05] and had a baby yes
[1:06:07] [Music]
[1:06:13] lived 45 years later
[1:06:20] he's a prophet his words
[1:06:23] they lived 45 years later but
[1:06:31] Abraham remarried again
[1:06:38] at that already
[1:06:43] he remarried severeign
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:21] foreign
[1:08:06] [Music]
[1:08:11] and Scientifics
[1:08:16] science
[1:08:20] Whatever It Is God proves that he is
[1:08:29] always proves his word
[1:08:33] he is right all others are wrong
[1:08:39] praise the Lord God proves his foreign
[1:09:26] I don't know what you're going through
[1:09:28] but wait
[1:09:30] Abraham waited
[1:09:33] and God gave him more than one yeah
[1:09:40] to have faith and your faith at work
[1:09:50] and then you wait upon the Lord praise
[1:09:52] the Lord
[1:09:54] hallelujah amen
[1:10:00] another thing you should do not judge
[1:10:02] yeah
[1:10:13] if you know and recognize your promise
[1:10:16] you can know it when it
[1:10:19] it becomes
[1:10:21] uh revealed age
[1:10:32] and if you have been moving in that
[1:10:34] promise whatever
[1:10:37] the first thing know your promise
[1:10:46] when you know it the time will occur
[1:10:50] s and you will recognize it but if you
[1:10:53] did not recognize your your promise in
[1:10:55] the first place you cannot know when it
[1:10:57] is
[1:11:03] because because Simeon
[1:11:08] maybe he was doing something maybe he
[1:11:10] was in the garden
[1:11:13] and the Holy Spirit because the whole
[1:11:16] now there was a man just in Jerusalem
[1:11:19] and called this human
[1:11:20] it's a Bitcoin
[1:11:24] Hallelujah men
[1:11:26] he was now there was a man in jail
[1:11:29] Southern called Simeon who was righteous
[1:11:32] and devote he was waiting for the
[1:11:34] consolation of Israel
[1:11:57] and he was waiting for the promise
[1:12:01] he waited and waited and waited his
[1:12:05] answer might have come differently yeah
[1:12:17] before it came in the form of a baby
[1:12:27] for him he was waiting to see a savior
[1:12:36] but the one who gave him the promise
[1:12:39] never identified how the Savior will
[1:12:41] come however the coming of the Savior
[1:12:43] was
[1:12:45] prophesies
[1:12:52] but the promise was next to the Charlie
[1:12:55] a virgin
[1:12:57] um
[1:13:06] now you
[1:13:08] know
[1:13:09] yeah
[1:13:15] so probably Simian would have thought
[1:13:18] that maybe a child will be born
[1:13:20] somewhere in Africa and then probably by
[1:13:22] the time you will see him he will be all
[1:13:25] see the Promise came in the form of a
[1:13:28] baby
[1:13:33] we had been watching for it and knew the
[1:13:37] answer when
[1:13:38] together
[1:13:58] but but how do you recognize it if you
[1:14:01] knew that that promise will happen
[1:14:11] where is the Lord
[1:14:16] so we must have faith
[1:14:18] and believe that he will reveal us what
[1:14:23] he promised
[1:14:25] to be cool
[1:14:36] the other issue that we are learning
[1:14:38] from Simeon we must hold to God these
[1:14:40] promises
[1:14:42] foreign
[1:15:17] knows how much younger he was when
[1:15:20] this reveal this Revelation came to him
[1:15:25] Yeti
[1:15:27] yeah
[1:15:29] it is like Abraham Ibrahim just trusted
[1:15:33] God yesterday
[1:15:35] if God said he would see the Messiah
[1:15:41] then it was so
[1:15:44] trusted to the Lord to bring about the
[1:15:46] circumstances
[1:15:49] the Lord to bring about the
[1:15:51] circumstances necessary to make it so
[1:15:53] yeah yes
[1:15:59] praise the Lord
[1:16:02] we should hold to God's promise
[1:16:07] if we say
[1:16:10] come away
[1:16:13] if the Lord said that he will sleep in
[1:16:17] peace in your house
[1:16:19] but right now there is no peace you will
[1:16:23] see foreign

[1:17:45] yes
[1:17:50] [Music]
[1:18:00] foreign
[1:18:47] and the Bible says
[1:18:50] she had given all she had and she could
[1:18:53] not give no more doctors why
[1:19:05] but when she had she took faith
[1:19:10] then she said that if I immediately
[1:19:13] touch at the Hem of His Garment I will
[1:19:15] be healed that is faith
[1:19:18] foreign
[1:19:27] [Music]
[1:20:18] see because you're gonna
[1:20:21] Jesus of Nazareth yes
[1:20:25] why do you come what did you want from

[1:20:39] you know how demons speak
[1:20:45] what do you want from us
[1:20:49] they recognized him
[1:20:52] but the body think it even us believers
[1:20:56] do not know that Jesus heals us
[1:21:02] you need to know that Jesus heals
[1:21:14] he promised and he fulfilled his wife
[1:21:21] on Earth whether I cast or a demon Jesus
[1:21:30] just cast it before the Lord and say
[1:21:33] Lord here I am sick and you say I shall
[1:21:36] be healed by the strikes by his strikes
[1:21:39] we were him
[1:21:46] um
[1:21:51] praise the Lord
[1:22:12] sometimes when you have a promise you
[1:22:14] can come to a place when you are really
[1:22:16] you you really you have no strength and
[1:22:20] you become frustrated by some
[1:22:21] circumstances
[1:22:26] some Temptations
[1:22:27] maybe more
[1:22:30] see and then and and you lose hope
[1:22:33] Soviet we know that but it's not to be
[1:22:37] money
[1:22:38] don't things happen but don't lose hope
[1:22:40] now yes

[1:22:45] [Music]
[1:22:49] oh yeah
[1:22:51] also

[1:23:00] so it is good to recognize your promise
[1:23:04] and you know where it is coming from
[1:23:08] now whatever
[1:23:10] one time Satan promised Jesus that I can
[1:23:13] give you the whole world
[1:23:31] I promise that if you would worship me I
[1:23:34] would give
[1:23:37] and true let me tell you brothers and

[2:06:42] Jesus
[2:06:45] for this evening that you have given to
[2:06:47] us to be in your presence
[2:06:49] we do not take it for granted Lord
[2:06:51] we appreciate every moment
[2:06:54] every song that is sung today
[2:06:57] every word that we have had you designed
[2:07:00] and prepared and planned that this will
[2:07:02] be the day we shall come to your house
[2:07:04] and be encouraged and be reminded about
[2:07:06] the promises that you have made
[2:07:09] Lord
[2:07:10] Minister has stood and he has spoken
[2:07:14] and reminded us of many people that
[2:07:17] received promises from you
[2:07:20] but father I do not remember hearing of
[2:07:22] any of them that say that he was given a
[2:07:26] promise and you
[2:07:27] never fulfilled it
[2:07:29] Lord we have heard about Sarah we have
[2:07:32] heard about Abraham
[2:07:35] fulfilled their promise Lord
[2:07:37] your promise that you meant to them Lord
[2:07:39] father we have heard about Simeon
[2:07:43] we have heard about
[2:07:45] all these men and women
[2:07:49] that waited and waited some for very
[2:07:51] many years
[2:07:53] but your promise
[2:07:55] never fell to the ground because you are
[2:07:58] God and your God by yourself when you
[2:08:00] speak
[2:08:01] your word is forever settled in heaven
[2:08:05] and it behooves us to believe everyone
[2:08:09] no matter what we see around us no
[2:08:12] matter what defaults us no matter what
[2:08:14] we don't feel or what we feel
[2:08:16] no matter what the devil might even try
[2:08:18] to do in our lives and our families in
[2:08:20] our homes
[2:08:23] father the day for no doubt has done so
[2:08:25] much against us but our faith is not in
[2:08:28] what the devil has done our faith is in
[2:08:30] the promises that you have made for us
[2:08:33] if we believe we are your children then
[2:08:36] we know we are hairs with you and Lord
[2:08:38] we know we have a lot of promises that
[2:08:40] are even yet unfulfilled and every one
[2:08:44] of them must be fulfilled
[2:08:47] Lord we are resting on that
[2:08:52] we know that you can never fail any of
[2:08:55] your children Lord we are not going to
[2:08:57] rest on the Promises of the devil the
[2:09:01] devil will also have promises he will
[2:09:02] give
[2:09:03] like a gift to Jesus told Jesus to bow
[2:09:07] down and worship him and then he would
[2:09:09] give him the whole world the devil would
[2:09:12] want to lie to us and show us the things
[2:09:15] of the world and tell us if we can only
[2:09:16] be able to to worship Him and worship
[2:09:21] in the world pride of life the lust of
[2:09:24] the eyes the lust of the flesh that you
[2:09:26] will give us all these things
[2:09:28] father we will not bow we will not Bend
[2:09:32] we will be like those brothers
[2:09:35] who walked into the fire they said we
[2:09:39] will not bow we will not bear
[2:09:42] we know that our God will fulfill his
[2:09:44] promise alone like the devil made a
[2:09:47] mistake
[2:09:48] that time to throw them in the fire when
[2:09:50] they had a promise The Devil Makes a
[2:09:52] mistake if he throws any of us in the
[2:09:54] fire because we have a promise
[2:09:57] and how the king told Daniel that your
[2:10:00] God will save you
[2:10:02] father if you are someone you always
[2:10:04] sure
[2:10:06] if our enemy intimidates you you are

[2:11:24] children I was trying to teach them that
