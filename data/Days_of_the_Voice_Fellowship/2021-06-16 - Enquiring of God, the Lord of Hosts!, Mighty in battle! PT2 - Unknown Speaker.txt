speak to you tomorrow come on you're getting our way amen i mean uh uh i just uh want to invite you uh to to go to the scripture um see that you know and uh we are going to read where we read last time we are speaking today on uh inquiring of god mighty in battle come on and the lord has been ministering to us and i'm going to come about that with you amen so i invite you to open your bibles in the book of fast quran cause and when the philistines heard that david was anointed king of all israel all the philistines went up to sick david and david heard of it and went out against them and the philistines came and spread themselves in the valley of refinement [Music] that's what david inquired of god saying shall i go up against the philistines and would thou deliver them into my hand and the lord said unto him go up for i will deliver them into their hands when you speak to the lord and the lord answers back gives you an assurance go and pursue the enemy amen amina the reason why we preach this message without fear or whatever you could tear it's because we know that the lord was with us and that when we got to attack the enemy he cannot so they came up to bile perez him and david smote them there then they would say god has broken in upon mine enemies then david said god has broken in upon my enemies by mine hand like the breaking forth of waters therefore they call the name of that place amen verse 12 and when they had when they had left their gods there david gave a commandment and they were banned with fire now david ordered that the gods of those philistines would be burnt with fire and the philistines yet again spread uh yet again spread now we'll look at verse 13. themselves are brought in the valley uh yet spread themselves abroad in the valley [Music] david inquired again of god and god said unto him go not up after them turn away from them and come upon them over against the mulberry trees [Music] and it shall be when thou hear a sound of going in the tops of the mulberry trees that then thou shalt go out of battle for god has gone forth before thee to smite the host of the philistines that double and the fame of david went out into all lands and the land that the lord brought the fear of him upon all nations now we understand that christians do not do things like unbelievers because we have the strength to do it we always wait upon the lord will the judges say that even the bible says that they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength as an ego they shall run and not be wary teach me lord teach me lord to wake up it's important for a child of god to learn to wait upon the lord [Applause] but you see how can you wait upon the lord if you have gotten inquired of whatever he says you very well know in your heart that is not going to give you his opinion but he's going to give you what you must do again god has no opinion god has final words [Music] is an absolute quran the bible is amen it's the absolute truth whatever god has spoken in his word it is the absolute truth [Applause] some of us have been following what is happening even in israel at this time and uh because you see we know that israel is god's time peace hallelujah i mean guess what i did not prepare this quote but i just want you brother if you can get it for me uh uh but isaac about the shame if you can quickly get for me that quote uganda as i also tried to find it here i just feel to read it for you here [Music] praise hello come on and i hope our audio is fine if our audio is not fine you just let us know okay we are reading from the message uh questions and answers on genesis 5307 29.99 do you believe that the jews return to palestine is a fulfillment of the bible prophecy [Music] and then he said if you want to see what time of the year it is are you hearing this if you want to see what time of night it is look at the clock tonight if you want to know what day you are living in [Music] [Music] what is to palestine was a fulfillment of prophecy and when we fast forward come back here or uh oh i think we have just gone back a little bit now you see they have been fighting walls with philistines never seen the suit for a very very long time the battles or the wars that you are hearing of happening now between israel and palestine did not just begin now it started many years ago but you [Applause] [Applause] so we notice that david got to charity inquired of the lord and uh we did talk about a lot of art in the first part of this summer and how david inquired of the lord and how god told him to go and attack them and now during the second phase david inquired again of the lord but when you hear the sound of the uh when you hear now i'm looking at verse 15 and it shall be when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the tops of the marbury trees then thou shalt go out of battle [Music] you know we sing that song rainbow tree the movie is on my brother the movie's older it's going to be a sign that i've already gone and here i'm not speaking to you the new testament church mechanism and empire the believers are spiritual israel the believers are the spiritual israelites chose israel [Music] praise the name of allah the king of glory the lord of hosts look at psalms 24 6. this is the generation of them that seek him that seek thy face or jacob lift your lift your lift up your heads all you get and be lift up ye evaluating doors and the king of glory shall come in [Music] who is this king of glory the lord strong and mighty the even lift them up here everlasting doors and the king of glory shall come in [Music] who is this king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory who is this king of glory [Music] [Applause] and god was on the side of the the philistines the jews and he has always been i tell you the enemies of israel [Applause] [Applause] when the lord is with you you can never be defeated while the lord is with you you can never be a city there is no way you can be a failure if the world is with you are you on the winning side [Applause] [Applause] god [Applause] even the believers the lord always he is but you know always with his message it is god himself [Applause] [Applause] when they came to attack again they went in the valley do you know why because they were like now we have prepared ourselves oh he knows where you are he knows your address he knows your life knows your situation do not complain because for your life he came down to uh uh to uh to david and he told him at this time his enemies waited and [Music] i believe because he has chosen a group of people all over the world and some of those are you my brothers and pictures [Applause] amen you come to this message [Applause] amen you will always be a king amen is [Applause] when you hear [Applause] the sound of the voice of god [Applause] blessed are you oh you are amen now know what to do all the blessings of god i said all the blessings of god amen it is not in business civil business it is not in being great in the world it is not in politics see me i'm freezing it is not in having a great name here is what i'm telling you the blessing of god is in this message [Music] [Music] [Applause] the sound of this message it separates us and gets us deeper with christ whereby the devil can do nothing a little bit more on that but let's just carry on here and i hope i'm okay with time but i'll have a few more minutes all right now let us uh look at job 9 2. the scripture says i know it is so over truth but how should man be just with god if you will con trained with him he cannot answer him one of a thousand he is wise in heart and mighty in strength who has hardened himself against him and has profes prospered which removeth the mountains and they know not which overturneth them in his anger which shaketh the earth out of our place and the pillars thereof tremble which commandeth the sun and it raises not and still sealeth up the stars which alone spreadeth out the heavens and treadeth upon the waves of the sea can you read those verses [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if anybody tells you that they have prospered and they had in their hearts against god [Music] [Music] are jewelry city and they know not exit i mean he can remove a mountain and the mountain will not even know all who am i talking about is [Applause] to eat grass [Applause] hallelujah [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] he was able to know that this is the lord [Music] david was only finishing them up [Music] and i want to read you a quote about almighty god about the conqueror the one who is mighty in battle amen i mean please fight out for me quickly amen i can see him when he died his soul went down into the regions of the lord remember again i can see him knock at the door open the doors and they're the mingling souls there in prison waiting for the day of judgment and so he found them in hell you know when jesus died he went straight to hell yes so he said open the doors and he said who is it and here we find out that these are the souls of them that were in prison waiting for the judgment hallelujah [Applause] these are the songs when is [Applause] [Applause] type of oh amen hallelujah i mean all right give me the quote now i want you to see our god not to preach to them that they might [Music] hallelujah i do not know if our order is still fine but hallelujah [Music] he said you ought to have believed you ought to have believed the prophets i am the one i spoke about and everything was written of me
