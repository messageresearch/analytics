prophesied with the born I don't care whether you're feeling dry say foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you may be in that Valley this morning but this service is meant to encourage I may be in that Valley this morning but listen to me now he believes the spirit of God is here this morning he can never come in your life and you remain the same and the spirit of the Lord carried Ezekiel and took him in a valley full of dry bones [Music] him to pass by them around above and behold there were very many in the open valleys and here this scripture read it one time as a pastor in Ethiopia that little church starting up and this sister was going through she had gone a lot of through a lot of problems in her life and since she believed the message it seemed as if God was not working for her she was going through a lot of trouble you know Financial constraints problems on every side came to me in the office crying I was a young Pastor I did not know what to do in such instances but you see what would help if the spirit of the Lord came in the room when the spirit of Lord comes in your life he makes a difference at that very moment I closed my I was sitting back in my chair and she was messy all over there the other side of the of the bench I just sat back and I closed my eyes because I was trying to feel where she was going on I was trying to relate to what with what she's going through that very moment the spirit of the Lord came in the room she said you were never the spirit of the Lord comes in the room something is bound to happen something always happens a living God not a god of doctrines only he's a God that comes out from the pages of the Bible comes into reality he manifest his presence for sure and again he is not just a more that we are worshiping he's a living God and at that moment I experience this power began to carry me up in the dreams of Revelation and you know things began to open up this scripture came in my mind I said it I didn't even know I I don't remember I had not rehearsed it against it but I I told her sister the word of God says but you see my sister he is asking you this question can these bones live again I said why did God the God where the bones can live again or not Obama again but why did he ask as a kid because he wanted to know [Music] he wants you to be involved in the Miracles in the miracle of the transformation of Our Lives Allah don't just lay there anointed here is the situation of your life what do you say not what God says would you remain like that how can God move you and do something new in your life and Ezekiel was lying there as a kid yeah you know that reminds me what happened with Moses Moses why do you cry there is a lot more in you than you know your mind that's why a Believer must never speak either word that's why I do not always like jesting and laughing about things whether I'm going through a bad situation I always say I am rich and actually even in real life many people think I have a lot more than what I really have in animals whatever I prophesy in my life it happens foreign [Music] let me tell you we need to learn to speak to the storms the scripture says yes and life are in the power of the past tell your name is amen it's not the time is the confession of the past and it's not a tongue that will do it because it is the spirit of the Lord which is going to come and follow the words of a Believer and he will make sure and here you know there's power and as I began to speak to that sister I spoke to her and said what do you say about the situation why do you cry can you live again God restore you talk to your glory all this money that is lost all this business and minimize all your life that you've lost my sister what do you say Laguna prophesy to the bones hallelujah amen prophesied these bones then saith the Lord thus saith the Lord God unto this born regular [Music] it God followed those who were cartoon baby and the first time he prophesied that was a noise and the bones came together everything was not yet perfect because there was no life and all the same news they also developed the flesh Came Upon him let me tell you my brother my sister take you through your situation but do not rush the process God does not see you as a failure God see you I sees you as a perfect bride a perfect job hallelujah amen that's how God sees me and a woman it can never happen foreign and at that moment you can say that I spoke through this system she had come from Dubai and worked there many many years and made a lot of money when she returned back to Ethiopia you know all these pastors the fake pastors in the name of frost prophecies you know you're gonna get married she wasn't married [Music] she she she didn't have money all that money was lost she became frustrated [Music] situations it seemed as if God was not coming through foreign to you that he will come through for you then that is on the basis of believing without seeing okay hoping without knowing knowing this one thing in your heart what he said is good enough for me I may not feel it I cannot say it is [Applause] foreign I know she was all um you are going to get a job not in a very long time it's going to be a powerful day and if this doesn't happen I will repent and I will confess it to everybody because these are not my words two weeks one two weeks we came in 14 days God ended a suffering that was for more than 30 years chick long story short and she was asked a question how much do you want to earn oh yeah and she spoke any amount she thought was the largest apartment [Music] and they told her welcome on board and they gave her the job a big American company they wanted someone who was qualified none of the people that were sent where is the fighting paper actually went through but the one that wasn't qualified she didn't have any papers Catalina she was given the job and she had that job for more than three or four years more than probably about five years God gave her a husband mommy God gave her a family God restore everything I was just remembering that testimony prophesy to the bones as Believers when we don't want to fear our fears anymore [Music] because this world can never failure his word is never negative amen and he told him that these bones that you see is represented in the house of Israeli see they were dried dried bones meaning all hope was low that's against us they were cut off from their parts he is speaking of Israel as a country because there was a time that Israel was dispared Israel and they were never in their Homeland and they were taken into Exiles [Applause] that God was prophesying you know these boys that were in the valley was representing Israel all the Hope was lost never be remembered by God again in other words whenever God calls you for a walk but then something for me hallelujah amen amen 16 years ago yeah I've seen Miracles demons hallelujah amen praise the name of Allah foreign when we come to hear the words it is [Music] here this morning it must work for you no matter your situation you may be Triad on those dry bones foreign [Music] foreign but here God was telling us I am going to disperse you in the question I'm gonna disperse all Israel you will go to the corners of the earth they will think that their God has left them don't think they'll never be in their Homeland again they will go through the Holocaust they will go through everything they will go through whoever will rise against the land I promise because I am going to do it I want you yeah what does it says you come down from heaven through the clouds and his face was according to the Book of Revelations we are pointing to the multitudes of three nations tongues and people foreign Roma Rome is in control of the world and here that romanism has taken over the whole world and then we find out that there was also his feet Mighty angel came down he put his right foot on the sea chicken what does that mean he put listen what are the periods of fire and practice himself into his chat into the body we the body of Christ foreign foreign so the charge of Christ [Music] is going to live above Romans and all the first doctrines then we find that there was the also another food the Bible talks about in the Revelation 13. America America as the Beast which comes out of the Earth America America actually is the source of all immorality America yes [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] our governments May publicly you know this uh discredit that kind of thing government is a Physicians they themselves are rotten to the core because they accept it internally there is no government of the world government is that you will not bow to it mark my word whatever the government of the world for the government is going to bow to the spirit again we are living in a time she said when that Beast out of the earth is actually taking over the Earth foreign fornication is going to remain always that I want you to understand it is a spirit it's an immoral Spirit the Bible even talks about spirits which came like frogs they are spirits of immorality taking immoral Spirit everywhere and you know the the things of the pleasures of the world second over the churches we're going to try to find God together when you go there you really got there to be entertained I am not here to entertain you sir no true preacher of the world ever preach to entertainment hallelujah amen when I preach I preach with one purpose the dry bones can live again so that by the preaching of the world demons can be cast that is the purpose of Holy Ghost preachers amen foreign [Music] [Applause] now I realize as individuals some of you may be those Dry Bones some of you may be living in terms problems I can't preach no more pictures listen because it's not coming out from me when I believe this message Hallelujah foreign I was able to live above fornication not because I wasn't drawn to it but because there was a hidden powers amen you can prophesy you're not living for the case I will not live in sin can you return it like this is [Music] research foreign foreign [Music] that all pastors are fake marriage and see what we have it is not just words we ourselves live what we preachers listen I am preaching to you my testimony it's not word from theology amen you can take a drug addict because foreign [Music] laughs there was a woman called Florence Nightingale white woman and she was somehow related to the founder of Red Cross and this woman was living in South Africa she came from South Africa South Africa when she heard that William Branham was visiting in in London he had gone there to meet the Kings and so she shattered a plane she shot at a plane I've been invited to South Africa many times [Music] South Africa and he prayed for that woman and a few months later I don't know how long it was she sent back a report with another picture but if you you can get it get those two pictures and put it up online for the people Florence Nightingale and she sent another picture now it is she was totally healed a weight restored um we believe in healing not the fake one second and then that is many years ago it was cold you're going to pray for a man who was dying with tuberculosis the doctors told us we couldn't enter Because the place was highly contagious and I am here on a mission not to get sick I can assure you I'm here to here because I'm sent by God to allow us a moment and when we walked into that hospital room we arrived there and uh and the man was on oxygen his name is and when I saw him as a human being I was scared but that life within me in Mark 16 18. lay their hands on the sick and the sick shall recovery I quoted that verse to the brother hallelujah amen and I laid my hand upon him he couldn't talk because he was an oxygen but I laid my hand upon Him Anyway I prayed for just a moment and told him I wanted to believe but I walked away that same day all the following they don't remember the man was taken out of boxes now remember by the time he arrived in this hospital he was a bad case because after six months more than six months of from there he was expected to go for barriers but not when somebody can prophesy foreign hallelujah amen there is power in the name of Jesus and that man in just four weeks God restored back his body God restored his hair four weeks that was a miracle challenge for the first time in six months 10 miles he said I will not take a car I want to walk and prove to the devil um down from the mountain where they put that hospital down to where we are near the airport and when the man came for the first time in my life so somebody giving a testimony and running to show that you see Hallelujah foreign many of them to death are still being baptized the entire video is on fire when you by faith must be able to speak by Revelation prophesy into your life is a life changer but you solve them God can pray turn you know from a beggar another Amen to a giver without going to pay somewhere your money your silver teaser for nothing without money or without price this message is all you need but come away true gospel through preaching of the Bible through Jesus is all you need yeah changes your life are you hearing me young sisters

power of prophet we have a prophet in our generation because it will collect all the four wings hallelujah hallelujah and when the Four Winds came together they came into the bonds and the bones
