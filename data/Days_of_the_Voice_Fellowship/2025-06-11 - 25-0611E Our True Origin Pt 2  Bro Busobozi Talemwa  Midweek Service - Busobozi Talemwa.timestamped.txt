[55:05] shout forever
[55:10] forever
[55:14] in
[55:17] a
[55:18] Sunday.
[55:29] Let us pray.
[55:33] If you have a need, just uh make it
[55:35] known by an uplifted hand as we pray.
[55:40] Our
[55:44] dear loving father, we come to you this
[55:46] evening.
[55:50] Lord, as your children have gathered,
[55:54] come from different places,
[55:57] some are tired from work,
[56:00] Lord, but they have come to be here in
[56:02] your presence,
[56:05] Lord. Some are streaming from afar,
[56:09] able to be here with us.
[56:12] Lord, we desire one thing Lord
[56:15] that you will say something which will
[56:18] impact our life positively.
[56:23] Lord, that you will move us closer
[56:27] to your coming,
[56:29] Lord. that you'll bring us a realization
[56:33] of the hour we are living in
[56:36] and what you're doing Lord
[56:39] around us and in us.
[56:42] My prayer Lord is that you will uh make
[56:44] us focus our eyes on you not on the
[56:47] things around us.
[56:53] And even Lord anybody could be going
[56:55] through something.
[56:58] I pray that you let their minds stay be
[57:00] stayed on you tonight
[57:05] that they will not stray to the left or
[57:07] to the right
[57:09] but they will look unto you Lord. We may
[57:12] all look unto you tonight,
[57:15] the author and the finisher of our
[57:18] faith.
[57:19] You are the the great one among us this
[57:22] evening
[57:24] and we ask that you may be seen.
[57:27] Lord, may you take me out of the way,
[57:29] my brother Henry Henry, and may you come
[57:33] and speak, Lord.
[57:35] We just coveret your presence.
[57:39] Grant it we pray in Jesus name. Amen.
[57:44] Amen.
[57:46] God bless you saints.
[57:50] Good evening.
[57:52] Amen. Turn to your neighbor. Tell them
[57:53] go you're welcome to the house.
[57:58] Amen. Amen. Yesterday um I had traveled
[58:03] with brother Shalom and brother Amram to
[58:06] go and see a few of our young people who
[58:09] are not here.
[58:14] I know you've you were not told
[58:16] previously but brother Praise is no
[58:18] longer on the organ because he went to
[58:20] the host.
[58:26] in Mitana
[58:28] at Central College there.
[58:30] So he's um uh of course going to be
[58:33] there for two years.
[58:36] Uh of course he will always be with us
[58:38] on the on the holidays.
[58:41] So we went to see him yesterday.
[58:45] Also, sister patience is not here.
[58:48] Because she also joined the host over
[58:52] what's the name of the school at Budo
[58:55] Christian School. And I'm happy that
[58:57] they at least can be able to attend the
[58:58] services at uh with brother Jesse
[59:04] uh also brother Noble
[59:08] uh who so both the the organists
[59:13] at school.
[59:15] So um but I think brother Noble should
[59:18] be really able to come on the weekends.
[59:24] Praise the Lord.
[59:26] Amen. And many of our young people of
[59:28] course are in in schools.
[59:31] But nevertheless, I just loved it that
[59:34] when brother Policy was at school.
[59:38] When he came back, he went for to the
[59:40] last sermon he had and he listened to
[59:42] all of them.
[59:49] Said he never wanted to be left behind.
[59:53] I encourage to all students
[59:56] when you go to school when you come back
[59:59] go back and see whatever was preached.
[1:00:04] Let us uh open our Bibles to the book of
[1:00:07] uh Luke chapter 23.
[1:00:13] We are continuing with our study that we
[1:00:15] had on Sunday.
[1:00:21] Uh, so this will be a part two of our
[1:00:24] true origin.
[1:00:30] I wasn't supposed to preach it as part
[1:00:32] two, but it's just a continuation
[1:00:33] because we never finished on Sunday.
[1:00:42] Excuse me. Vers 39
[1:00:47] 23. Luke 239.
[1:00:52] [Music]
[1:00:55] And one of the male factors which were
[1:00:57] which were hanged railed on him saying,
[1:01:01] "If thou be Christ, save thyself and
[1:01:04] us."
[1:01:17] But the other answering rebuked him,
[1:01:20] saying, Dust not thou fear God, seeing
[1:01:22] thou art in the same condemnation?
[1:01:27] [Music]
[1:01:33] And we indeed justly, for we receive the
[1:01:36] due reward of our deeds. But this man
[1:01:40] has done nothing a miss.
[1:01:54] And he said unto Jesus,
[1:01:58] Lord, remember me when thou comest into
[1:02:01] thy kingdom.
[1:02:07] And Jesus said unto him, verily I say
[1:02:09] unto thee, today shalt thou be with me
[1:02:12] in paradise.
[1:02:20] Amen. You may be seated. Brother, if you
[1:02:23] can help us with those echoes,
[1:02:27] I think you need to
[1:02:30] bring it down a little bit.
[1:02:34] Uh, our true origin.
[1:02:40] Now saints, the subject that we're
[1:02:42] dealing with
[1:02:45] um I should say is the purpose
[1:02:51] why God sent us the end time message.
[1:02:58] Are we all here
[1:03:01] now? We have only a short time this
[1:03:03] evening.
[1:03:06] put your thoughts together. Do not allow
[1:03:09] anything to distract you.
[1:03:11] Amen. Let us stay together and let's see
[1:03:14] what the Lord will
[1:03:16] grant us this evening. And I'm so happy
[1:03:18] that we have been able to come in his
[1:03:19] presence.
[1:03:22] He he you know whenever we come
[1:03:25] uh he wants to minister to us.
[1:03:28] Happy to see sister fortunate.
[1:03:32] Amen.
[1:03:33] So now you remember the subject, we
[1:03:35] remember the scriptures we read last on
[1:03:38] Sunday.
[1:03:40] One of them actually the very first one
[1:03:43] we began with
[1:03:46] is um Jesus
[1:03:51] um okay we started with the one where
[1:03:54] Jesus was asking the disciples who the
[1:03:58] people said he was.
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:03] And people had many um you know they
[1:04:06] thought he was one of the prophets.
[1:04:11] So they could not go beyond what they
[1:04:13] they were seeing.
[1:04:17] Brother Daniel, brother Isaac, please
[1:04:19] stay your focus your minds here. I I
[1:04:21] don't want I don't want you to miss
[1:04:22] this. This is not just another sermon.
[1:04:27] If you miss it, you you've missed
[1:04:30] It's a it's an inspiration that God gave
[1:04:32] me
[1:04:34] and I pray that we don't really miss it.
[1:04:37] So the people were really um the the
[1:04:40] disciples
[1:04:44] told him what people thought of him
[1:04:48] and it was true. Jesus was the son of
[1:04:51] man at the time. He was a prophet. As a
[1:04:53] son of man he was a prophet.
[1:04:56] So now when people say that he was a
[1:04:58] prophet
[1:05:00] They were right. But you see, they they
[1:05:04] did not see beyond the badger skin, the
[1:05:07] the flesh.
[1:05:12] They only could see what they were
[1:05:14] seeing.
[1:05:16] And so they could define Jesus
[1:05:19] by what they were seeing.
[1:05:23] You understand? They could not go beyond
[1:05:26] what they were seeing.
[1:05:29] And the world can only define us by the
[1:05:32] way they seeing us.
[1:05:36] They can't see beyond this flesh.
[1:05:40] And many people actually living in this
[1:05:43] world today.
[1:05:45] They define themselves. We define
[1:05:47] ourselves
[1:05:49] by what we are seeing.
[1:05:51] And this is many times the family we are
[1:05:54] born in,
[1:05:56] the failures we have in this life, the
[1:05:58] problems we we face, the challenges we
[1:06:01] face and then we end up defining
[1:06:03] ourselves
[1:06:05] by those things and we cannot go beyond
[1:06:09] those things
[1:06:11] to see that our origin.
[1:06:14] Look, if you what you see of yourself
[1:06:19] shows what you see of your origin,
[1:06:25] whose son are you? Whose child are you?
[1:06:30] What what tribe are you? What culture
[1:06:33] are you from?
[1:06:35] That is if you can answer all those
[1:06:37] questions, what comes to mind? You say
[1:06:40] I'm a musa from Cami. My father is so
[1:06:44] and so. That's what you see.
[1:06:48] But a true son of God is beyond all
[1:06:52] that.
[1:06:54] A true son of God is none of anything
[1:06:58] that you just mentioned.
[1:07:02] A true son of God is a spirit being.
[1:07:08] He came from God.
[1:07:11] A true son of God has always been a part
[1:07:13] of God.
[1:07:17] He came into this world to be manifested
[1:07:21] that he may do what?
[1:07:23] Destroy the works of Satan
[1:07:27] and then go back to where he came from.
[1:07:32] If you really are a Bible reader,
[1:07:35] you will just know I was quoting a verse
[1:07:38] speaking about Jesus.
[1:07:41] He was manifested into this world
[1:07:44] that he may do what? Destroy the works
[1:07:47] of Satan.
[1:07:49] And then he will go back to God. He
[1:07:52] said, "I came from God. I go back."
[1:07:55] And and so you see Jesus he was able to
[1:07:58] overcome
[1:08:00] not because he was not a human being.
[1:08:03] Jesus was a human being like all of us.
[1:08:07] But Jesus saw more than what others saw
[1:08:11] of him.
[1:08:15] Jesus knew his true origin.
[1:08:19] Jesus knew he did not come from Mary.
[1:08:24] Jesus knew he did not come from Joseph.
[1:08:28] Jesus knew. He came from God.
[1:08:33] And by the way, that's the victory that
[1:08:35] overcomes the world.
[1:08:39] And I am going to begin
[1:08:41] by uh reading and I I read this for
[1:08:44] somebody yesterday.
[1:08:46] This is not in my notes.
[1:08:49] It has come to me again.
[1:08:51] We have read this quote multiple
[1:08:53] multiple times
[1:08:56] but we shall read it until you receive
[1:08:58] the revelation.
[1:09:00] I'm just going to read a little portion.
[1:09:03] But the bottom says
[1:09:06] uh the devil
[1:09:08] cannot stand the book of revelation.
[1:09:14] He fights it
[1:09:16] and he wants to make he says the book of
[1:09:18] revelation shows how the antichrist
[1:09:20] spirit would come into the church and
[1:09:22] defile it
[1:09:28] making it lukewarm
[1:09:30] making the church formal making the
[1:09:33] church powerless.
[1:09:34] It exposes Satan
[1:09:38] by revealing his works.
[1:09:42] The works of Satan. What are the works
[1:09:43] of Satan?
[1:09:45] The works of Satan is the attempted
[1:09:47] destruction of God's people and the
[1:09:49] discrediting of God's word
[1:09:56] right down to the time he is cast into
[1:09:57] the lake of fire.
[1:10:01] He cannot stand it. He knows. Now this
[1:10:05] is what Satan knows.
[1:10:07] He knows that if the people
[1:10:11] get the true revelation
[1:10:14] of the true church
[1:10:16] and what she is,
[1:10:22] if you got it, say amen.
[1:10:24] Now in this case, brother did not say
[1:10:28] that if the Satan knows that if the
[1:10:32] church will receive the true revelation
[1:10:36] of Jesus Christ. No.
[1:10:39] But if the church will receive the true
[1:10:42] revelation
[1:10:44] of the true church
[1:10:47] and what the true church is.
[1:10:51] If you the church receive that
[1:10:52] revelation
[1:10:54] and what she stands for
[1:10:57] and that she can do the greater work,
[1:11:01] she the church will be an invisible
[1:11:04] army.
[1:11:06] The devil knows that that is the only
[1:11:09] revelation
[1:11:12] which can defeat
[1:11:15] all of hell.
[1:11:17] And he will try to keep us
[1:11:20] from that revelation.
[1:11:24] This cannot be told to you. You have to
[1:11:27] receive it from God.
[1:11:30] If you don't have a revelation of who
[1:11:32] you are,
[1:11:34] you will do everything the world does.
[1:11:39] You will live like the world.
[1:11:42] You will dress like the world. You will
[1:11:44] speak like the world. You will do things
[1:11:46] like the world. But when you know who
[1:11:49] you are, you cannot be defined by what
[1:11:52] the world says or does.
[1:11:56] And that is the message of the hour.
[1:11:59] The purpose of of the revelation of the
[1:12:01] seven seal
[1:12:04] so the church can know who she is.
[1:12:08] Hallelujah. All these doctrines.
[1:12:11] Amen.
[1:12:13] All the doctrines that we teach
[1:12:16] are good.
[1:12:18] They are very fine. But let me tell you,
[1:12:21] we need to go beyond the doctrine.
[1:12:26] The message is not doctrines.
[1:12:30] The message is not even rules,
[1:12:34] laws, what we should do and what we
[1:12:37] should not do.
[1:12:39] If that is the message
[1:12:42] then there are others who are better
[1:12:44] than us
[1:12:46] there are many things I have to say but
[1:12:48] I will take it in portions
[1:12:51] and this evening I'm going to also take
[1:12:52] it in portions
[1:12:54] and I will quit and next Sunday I I will
[1:12:56] add on May God help us to understand
[1:12:59] each other
[1:13:02] there are people who are better than us
[1:13:04] in rules
[1:13:08] if The end time message are rules
[1:13:12] about holiness
[1:13:15] and what we should do and what we should
[1:13:16] not do.
[1:13:18] There are those who are much better than
[1:13:20] us.
[1:13:23] If you don't know, go and research about
[1:13:25] a church called the apostolic church.
[1:13:31] It's a holiness movement.
[1:13:34] We I found the I got my first encounter
[1:13:37] with them was in Ethiopia.
[1:13:39] My friend, you think we preach holiness?
[1:13:43] Wait until you go to them.
[1:13:45] That's when you will know in the
[1:13:47] message. We are not even preaching
[1:13:48] holiness.
[1:13:51] If if you think that holiness is a is a
[1:13:54] works
[1:13:56] of righteousness,
[1:14:00] they believe in cleanness and holiness.
[1:14:05] sister. Their sisters dressed very well.
[1:14:09] You won't find one with tight anything.
[1:14:13] You won't find anyone with earrings.
[1:14:16] You won't find one anyone with nose
[1:14:18] jewels,
[1:14:21] even makeup,
[1:14:22] even lipstick.
[1:14:25] They will not even wear jewelry.
[1:14:30] necklace. They will not wear not even
[1:14:34] rings.
[1:14:36] They will not wear because it is unholy.
[1:14:40] According to them, all jewelry is
[1:14:42] sinful.
[1:14:45] But our prophet has taught us otherwise.
[1:14:49] He he told us it has no problem
[1:14:52] depending on the motive.
[1:14:54] That's why we wear rings.
[1:14:57] That's why he said if your husband buys
[1:14:59] you necklace he said it is okay.
[1:15:04] So on that basis
[1:15:06] they are better than us. They preach
[1:15:09] holiness better than us.
[1:15:11] Are you are you following me? Are you
[1:15:13] following me church?
[1:15:15] So if you are to say we should teach
[1:15:18] holiness and that's it. Some people are
[1:15:21] better than us.
[1:15:25] If you say we preach healing,
[1:15:29] miracles, signs and wonders and then you
[1:15:32] want to tell us that if if you have
[1:15:36] that,
[1:15:38] you have everything. Let me tell you,
[1:15:41] there are people who are better at it.
[1:15:46] Sometimes I see some message believers,
[1:15:49] preachers who want to bring
[1:15:52] Pentecostalism back into the message.
[1:15:57] We in the message believe in healing,
[1:15:59] signs, miracles and wonders.
[1:16:03] But we understand also
[1:16:06] that is only the first and second pool
[1:16:08] of anointing.
[1:16:13] The message is beyond that.
[1:16:17] But but we believe in healing.
[1:16:21] Amen. I've seen healing in my ministry.
[1:16:24] and and we agree with it.
[1:16:27] But if I I begin to lift it
[1:16:32] and make it look like if nobody has a
[1:16:35] healing ministry like mine
[1:16:39] and I make my entire ministry all about
[1:16:41] healing,
[1:16:44] then I am not preaching the message of
[1:16:46] the hour.
[1:16:50] Can do better.
[1:16:53] If you want miracles,
[1:16:55] go to miracle center.
[1:16:58] Serious miracles.
[1:17:00] Real miracles.
[1:17:02] Okay, you can debate whether they are
[1:17:03] real or not.
[1:17:06] But according to the message, I believe
[1:17:07] they are real miracles
[1:17:10] because brother Bham preached
[1:17:13] anointed ones at the end time.
[1:17:17] He said the anointing is right
[1:17:20] but they are false.
[1:17:22] Why are they false? Because they do not
[1:17:24] have the right message
[1:17:28] and talked about
[1:17:32] revival.
[1:17:34] That was a real
[1:17:38] I had time to go and give you all the
[1:17:40] examples
[1:17:43] and they have measured on the Holy Ghost
[1:17:46] as a subject.
[1:17:48] If you have got the Holy Ghost, you have
[1:17:51] it all. But you see the Bible says I
[1:17:55] it's not my subject today, but he says,
[1:17:58] let us let us, you know, leave
[1:18:03] these principles
[1:18:05] of the doctrine of Christ
[1:18:08] and he he mentions the principles,
[1:18:11] the foundations
[1:18:13] and he says uh of the doctrine of
[1:18:15] repentance.
[1:18:17] Amen. So if you want to preach about
[1:18:19] repentance,
[1:18:21] there are better people who preach about
[1:18:23] repentance.
[1:18:25] There is a man here in Kenya, he
[1:18:28] preaches repentance. How many know him
[1:18:30] with a long beard?
[1:18:33] Yeah. If you hear him preach about
[1:18:34] repentance,
[1:18:36] you will say truly this is the Elijah
[1:18:37] which was to come.
[1:18:40] But that is the foundation.
[1:18:42] That is the beginning.
[1:18:45] Repentance from dead works.
[1:18:48] It doesn't mean we should not preach
[1:18:49] repentance.
[1:18:52] The message is a full package.
[1:18:55] Amen. The message Amen. We are it's the
[1:18:58] crowning of the whole building.
[1:19:03] But you see the building is not just
[1:19:05] crown.
[1:19:09] You have to build from ground.
[1:19:13] So all these denominations you see and
[1:19:15] movements and revival
[1:19:19] they are somewhere in the building
[1:19:22] but others are stuck in the foundation.
[1:19:26] They have never left.
[1:19:29] You you go back and read it says you see
[1:19:32] it says the um the the the doctrine of
[1:19:36] repentance from dead works.
[1:19:41] The Holy Spirit is just leading me to
[1:19:42] read things which I did not prepare to
[1:19:44] read.
[1:19:46] Oh my. I want you to uh to be attentive
[1:19:51] tonight.
[1:19:53] Therefore, living the principles
[1:19:56] Hebrews 6 of the doctrine of Christ,
[1:20:01] let us go on unto perfection.
[1:20:05] So there are principles,
[1:20:07] the foundational principles
[1:20:10] that everybody must believe
[1:20:13] as long as they believe in Christ.
[1:20:16] And one of them it says is the doctrine
[1:20:20] of repentance from dead works.
[1:20:25] What is it? Foundation. Everybody say
[1:20:28] foundation.
[1:20:30] That's a foundational doctrine.
[1:20:32] Every Bible church must believe it.
[1:20:37] repentance from dead works.
[1:20:39] We believe in repentance. We preach
[1:20:42] repentance. But our message is more than
[1:20:45] repentance.
[1:20:48] Amen. We are in a last age. We're in the
[1:20:52] last day. We are the roofing of the
[1:20:54] church.
[1:20:56] The head has come down.
[1:20:59] We are no longer right at the foot.
[1:21:02] We are right at the at the crowning of
[1:21:04] the old sea.
[1:21:06] The head has come down. The opening of
[1:21:09] the seals tell us the head has come
[1:21:11] down.
[1:21:14] All right. But but you see the
[1:21:16] foundation is
[1:21:19] repentance from dead works
[1:21:22] and faith toward God.
[1:21:24] There are people who can preach faith.
[1:21:29] For us in our church, we don't preach
[1:21:30] faith.
[1:21:32] We don't major on it.
[1:21:36] This message is not about just preaching
[1:21:38] about faith.
[1:21:41] If you want to hear people who preached
[1:21:43] about faith,
[1:21:45] there are many like uh Toss about like
[1:21:50] or Robert about and we have many like
[1:21:54] them in the world today who are
[1:21:58] preaching faith
[1:22:00] and is a very wonderful thing but it is
[1:22:02] a foundational doctrine.
[1:22:05] Every believer and every Bible church
[1:22:07] should preach and believe in faith.
[1:22:11] Can we say amen to that? But you see
[1:22:14] that is the foundation.
[1:22:17] The bride has something more than that.
[1:22:21] Amen. The bride has grown and is growing
[1:22:26] into perfection.
[1:22:29] Then you see of the doctrine of baptism.
[1:22:33] Amen. Baptisms.
[1:22:36] There are different types of baptism.
[1:22:38] There is water baptism. There is Holy
[1:22:41] Ghost baptism.
[1:22:43] These are all foundational doctrines of
[1:22:45] the Christian faith.
[1:22:48] Everyone who believes is baptized in
[1:22:51] water and God fills them with the Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost. That is a must. That is a
[1:22:58] foundation.
[1:22:59] If anyone rejects this, they have
[1:23:02] rejected the Bible. They have rejected
[1:23:05] the doctrine of Christ.
[1:23:07] It's a foundation and we all believe it.
[1:23:11] But I tell you what, we are going
[1:23:14] farther more than that.
[1:23:17] We cannot lay a calm
[1:23:21] around water baptism.
[1:23:24] We are not Baptists.
[1:23:27] We cannot lay a camp
[1:23:29] just holy ghost baptism.
[1:23:32] You know, we are not Pentecostals.
[1:23:34] Come on church. We are going out to
[1:23:36] where unto perfection.
[1:23:40] Oh my my my my. You see then he says the
[1:23:45] doctrine of laying on of hands.
[1:23:48] All these are principles
[1:23:50] of the doctrine of Christ.
[1:23:53] Laying on of hands.
[1:23:55] Amen. That's why you know where we have
[1:23:58] arrived.
[1:23:59] You know we are no longer all about
[1:24:02] prayer lines.
[1:24:05] You know prayer line, prayer line,
[1:24:07] prayer line.
[1:24:09] We we are in the third phase of this
[1:24:11] ministry.
[1:24:14] Are you following me church? Amen. We
[1:24:18] are at a place where we are speaking and
[1:24:22] things materialize.
[1:24:26] As I'm preaching to you, you are in a
[1:24:29] prayer line.
[1:24:31] Amen. If I am an unadopted son of God,
[1:24:35] you're coming to a place where the world
[1:24:38] is created.
[1:24:41] Amen.
[1:24:43] All right. Our faith each of us is not
[1:24:45] the same.
[1:24:48] Our level of growth is not the same.
[1:24:53] That is why we still handle prayer line.
[1:24:58] We believe the Bible said this we will
[1:24:59] do.
[1:25:02] If the Lord permits,
[1:25:04] I will still do it even today. But you
[1:25:07] know what? You have to grow.
[1:25:10] You have to come on to perfection.
[1:25:13] You have to know it's no longer about
[1:25:14] the prayer line.
[1:25:17] It's no longer about pastor touch me.
[1:25:20] Do this. It's no longer about the
[1:25:22] pastor. You have come to a place where
[1:25:25] you realize you
[1:25:29] realize Look, I'm a son of God. If I
[1:25:33] know who I am, I have the authority. I
[1:25:36] have the power. Where is it? It's not in
[1:25:39] the pastor. It's not in a holy priest.
[1:25:43] It is in me as a believer. This sign
[1:25:48] should follow them. Everybody that
[1:25:51] believe
[1:25:52] in power to bind to lose in a holy
[1:25:56] priesthood.
[1:25:59] It is in every believer.
[1:26:02] You see this is the purpose
[1:26:05] of the seven seals
[1:26:08] of the of the opening of the seals
[1:26:13] and I'm coming to that. It may take a
[1:26:16] few services
[1:26:18] but I will eventually get there. Now as
[1:26:20] we are getting into it you may not
[1:26:22] understand everything.
[1:26:25] All right. And then he says uh the
[1:26:28] resurrection of the dead.
[1:26:31] You know it's a principle
[1:26:34] the rapture. Are you the only ones who
[1:26:36] preach the rapture?
[1:26:39] You go and listen to
[1:26:44] he preaches the rapture better than some
[1:26:45] of us.
[1:26:48] So it's not only exclusive to the
[1:26:49] message church.
[1:26:53] There are some who don't believe in the
[1:26:54] rapture, but there are some who really
[1:26:56] do
[1:26:58] and they preach it so well and they
[1:27:00] place it so well in the Bible.
[1:27:04] Why? Because it is a a principle of the
[1:27:07] doctrine of Christ.
[1:27:10] It is a foundation.
[1:27:13] It's not only exclusive to us message
[1:27:16] believers.
[1:27:18] When you preach the rapture, you are not
[1:27:21] yet preaching the message.
[1:27:23] When you preach the the baptism of the
[1:27:26] Holy Ghost, you are not yet preaching
[1:27:28] the message, when you're preaching water
[1:27:30] baptism in Jesus name, you are not
[1:27:33] preaching the message yet.
[1:27:36] There are others who do preach those
[1:27:37] things and they're not even in the
[1:27:39] message. When you're preaching
[1:27:41] repentance, you are not yet preaching
[1:27:43] the message. When you're preaching
[1:27:45] laying on of you, you are not yet there.
[1:27:48] What is the message? Oh, I want to show
[1:27:51] you church.
[1:27:52] Amen. As we will see, let me summarize
[1:27:55] it right now. What is the message? The
[1:27:58] message is you
[1:28:00] realizing who you are,
[1:28:04] the revelation
[1:28:06] of a true church and what you stand for.
[1:28:13] My God, may God help us to see these
[1:28:15] things
[1:28:17] and eternal judgment. And apostle Paul
[1:28:20] says, "And this we will do
[1:28:24] if God permit."
[1:28:28] And we have kept on doing.
[1:28:30] When we go out, we preach, people
[1:28:31] believe, we baptize them.
[1:28:34] God permits it.
[1:28:36] But let me tell you what you need to go
[1:28:39] to the rapture.
[1:28:41] What you need for the change of your
[1:28:44] is not a doctrine of water baptism.
[1:28:47] It's not a doctrine of repentance.
[1:28:49] There's not a doctrine of that. There's
[1:28:51] not a teaching on that. What you need is
[1:28:54] a revelation of who you are.
[1:28:58] Hallelujah. I will prove to you by the
[1:29:00] Bible.
[1:29:01] There is somebody here in the Bible
[1:29:04] who made it into the other dimension
[1:29:07] without ever knowing any doctrine.
[1:29:09] Hallelujah.
[1:29:12] But the only thing in you he had
[1:29:15] received a revelation
[1:29:18] of who Jesus was. If you receive the
[1:29:21] revelation of who Jesus is, then you
[1:29:24] will receive a revelation of the future
[1:29:28] and what you stand for.
[1:29:31] Hallelujah.
[1:29:33] Amen. Amen. But if you receive a
[1:29:35] revelation
[1:29:37] of the true church, Amen. you. It means
[1:29:40] you have revelation of of the of of who
[1:29:42] Jesus Christ is.
[1:29:45] And if you get a chance, you will
[1:29:48] fulfill the doctrine of Christ.
[1:29:51] If that man had left that cross,
[1:29:54] the first thing he would have done is to
[1:29:55] be watered.
[1:29:58] But God never permitted.
[1:30:00] So what happened? He went straight into
[1:30:02] the other.
[1:30:05] Hallelujah.
[1:30:08] So Jesus asked the disciples, "Who do
[1:30:11] they say I am?" They say you are this.
[1:30:14] What about you? What do you say I am?
[1:30:17] Amen. Peter, by revelation, he said,
[1:30:19] "You are Jesus Christ, the son of the
[1:30:23] living. You are more than a man. You are
[1:30:26] God in flesh." Amen. And Jesus said, "Oh
[1:30:30] Peter, flesh and blood have revealed
[1:30:33] this to you, but my father in heaven and
[1:30:36] upon this revelation,
[1:30:39] I will build my church." The church of
[1:30:41] Jesus is built upon the revelation,
[1:30:45] but who Jesus is. The true church knows
[1:30:49] who Jesus is. Amen. Even today, we know
[1:30:54] who Jesus is. It's not because they
[1:30:56] preach repentance.
[1:30:58] We can know that's not Jesus. It's not
[1:31:01] because they they have signs and
[1:31:02] wonders.
[1:31:03] We can know that's not Jesus. We know
[1:31:06] who Jesus is. We know the revelation.
[1:31:14] Who is he? He's more than a religion.
[1:31:18] He's more than a denomination. He's more
[1:31:20] than a man. He's more than a c. He's
[1:31:23] more than following a religion. He's
[1:31:25] more than a set of rules. People
[1:31:29] will tell you which church do you go to
[1:31:32] and they're confused.
[1:31:34] They think the church you go to is
[1:31:36] equals to Jesus.
[1:31:40] But this message is beyond denomination.
[1:31:43] Is beyond your church name. Now we have
[1:31:46] a revelation. It's no longer about your
[1:31:49] church name.
[1:31:52] Jesus. Amen. Is not your church name.
[1:31:55] Jesus is the word.
[1:31:59] Hallelujah.
[1:32:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Friends, and
[1:32:04] then I showed you another scripture,
[1:32:07] the devil himself
[1:32:09] tempting Jesus. And he told him,
[1:32:14] um, if you be the son of God, make these
[1:32:18] stones bright. you be the servant. So
[1:32:21] the devil doubted
[1:32:24] who Jesus was.
[1:32:27] Now we see but the bottom says Jesus
[1:32:31] knew
[1:32:32] who he was.
[1:32:36] He knew
[1:32:38] he was not about to know.
[1:32:41] He knew
[1:32:44] that is the only thing that made Jesus
[1:32:47] overcome the world.
[1:32:50] He knew who he was.
[1:32:52] No matter what situation he found
[1:32:53] himself in
[1:32:55] he knew who he was. He knew nothing can
[1:32:58] change who he is.
[1:33:01] He knew where he came from. He knew
[1:33:03] where he was going.
[1:33:05] Amen. He knew he was the beginning and
[1:33:09] he was the end. And that's the same
[1:33:12] thing that the church must know. And
[1:33:16] that's why God sent Elijah to
[1:33:19] for us to know
[1:33:21] who we are what we stand for.
[1:33:26] The devil can't defeat us.
[1:33:29] Amen. Who are we? We are sons of God.
[1:33:34] Amen. Amen. What does it say in the
[1:33:37] word? But now we are sons of God. Amen.
[1:33:42] It does not yet appear
[1:33:45] what we shall be. But we know that when
[1:33:48] he shall appear, we shall be like him.
[1:33:52] We shall be like him. We shall be like
[1:33:54] him. No more sick, no more death, no
[1:33:58] more problems, no more suffering, no
[1:34:00] more blind,
[1:34:02] no more lust,
[1:34:04] no more foolishness,
[1:34:06] no more debate.
[1:34:08] We shall be like him. No more church and
[1:34:12] denomination.
[1:34:13] No more blind and lazy.
[1:34:17] We shall be like him.
[1:34:20] Amen.
[1:34:22] And that's the purpose
[1:34:24] of the opening of the seals
[1:34:26] because the seals when they were
[1:34:28] removed,
[1:34:30] what is the contents there?
[1:34:33] The names of all those
[1:34:36] that were redeemed.
[1:34:38] Amen. Went before the foundation.
[1:34:41] So you are the seals revealed.
[1:34:44] Hallelujah.
[1:34:46] Stop complicating it.
[1:34:49] It's all about you.
[1:34:51] That's why he said behold
[1:34:54] I send
[1:34:55] you.
[1:34:57] Hallelujah.
[1:34:59] Come on now. Yes. He said I send you.
[1:35:03] I send you Elijah the prophet. It's not
[1:35:07] about Elijah.
[1:35:09] It's about me. It's about the church.
[1:35:13] Oh, if the true church, we know who she
[1:35:15] is. Amen. Who is she? She's a son of
[1:35:20] God. She's a part of God. Amen. Blood of
[1:35:24] blood and of
[1:35:27] God.
[1:35:32] But we have a lot of problems
[1:35:35] around us.
[1:35:37] Oh God, I'm poor. How am I going to pay
[1:35:40] my rent?
[1:35:43] And then the devil makes you to think
[1:35:44] you are.
[1:35:46] You are poor. Oh God, I'm sick.
[1:35:51] How am I going to overcome this
[1:35:52] sickness?
[1:35:55] Uhuh.
[1:35:57] But when you receive this revelation,
[1:35:59] you realize
[1:36:01] something no one has known.
[1:36:05] You realize who you are. You are not
[1:36:08] this piece of flesh.
[1:36:11] You are beyond what they know.
[1:36:14] You are beyond what they see. You are
[1:36:17] beyond what you feel.
[1:36:23] Then when temptation comes
[1:36:25] like Jesus when temptation came he stood
[1:36:29] still
[1:36:30] because he knew who he was.
[1:36:33] So devil, give me a break, please.
[1:36:37] You know I'm lusting after food.
[1:36:40] My stomach is hurting. Please don't
[1:36:42] tempt me. Oh God, don't let the devil
[1:36:46] temp. Take him away. Let me go for a
[1:36:50] fasting and prayer for 40 days to cast
[1:36:53] away the demon of last for food.
[1:36:59] You get the point.
[1:37:02] That's why we don't do those kind of
[1:37:03] fasts Pentecostals do.
[1:37:09] You get the point.
[1:37:11] If you don't have the revelation of what
[1:37:13] I'm talking about, you are going to
[1:37:14] misunderstand this sermon today.
[1:37:20] We believe in fasting.
[1:37:23] Jesus fasted also
[1:37:25] by revelation
[1:37:27] and our first fasting must be done by
[1:37:29] revelation.
[1:37:32] God puts a fast on you.
[1:37:35] You don't have to collect everybody.
[1:37:36] Let's fast.
[1:37:38] When he puts it on you,
[1:37:40] to pray, he went for days, four nights,
[1:37:43] he was praying fasting.
[1:37:46] And he knew he was by the time he's
[1:37:49] coming out. So we
[1:37:52] devil comes.
[1:37:54] He didn't call for reinforcement.
[1:37:57] On the cross, he cried.
[1:38:00] as a man. But right here, right here,
[1:38:05] when he was being tempted, he never
[1:38:07] cried for God to come and help him.
[1:38:12] What was being done on the cross
[1:38:15] was the will of God.
[1:38:20] It was God punishing him, uplifting him
[1:38:25] for you, and for me. But right here,
[1:38:30] right here.
[1:38:31] It was not the will of God
[1:38:34] that the devil will finish him and
[1:38:36] overcome him.
[1:38:39] So Jesus
[1:38:42] overcame
[1:38:44] how by knowing who he was.
[1:38:49] He didn't cry. He didn't pray. He didn't
[1:38:52] beg. He he did not plead with the devil.
[1:38:57] He stood with him.
[1:38:59] face to face. It wasn't that the devil
[1:39:02] was standing there.
[1:39:04] The devil was standing in his mind.
[1:39:08] He stands in our mind every day.
[1:39:12] Some of you is talking to you right now,
[1:39:18] telling you negative things
[1:39:21] and you're fighting. The greatest battle
[1:39:23] ever fought
[1:39:26] were in the mind.
[1:39:29] And he's telling you things causing you
[1:39:31] to unbelieve.
[1:39:33] But what makes you overcome the world?
[1:39:36] When you know who you are, you then you
[1:39:38] know what you need to to use to overcome
[1:39:40] the world.
[1:39:41] The word the word the word because you
[1:39:44] and the word are not separate.
[1:39:47] You and the word are one. Jesus said, "I
[1:39:50] and my father are one."
[1:39:52] Amen. And we know I and Jesus are one.
[1:39:56] Who is he? The word.
[1:39:59] So the word is not here.
[1:40:01] The word is not here.
[1:40:04] Are you hearing me, brother? The word is
[1:40:06] not here.
[1:40:08] It is in here.
[1:40:11] The word is in me.
[1:40:13] I am the word
[1:40:16] made flesh today.
[1:40:20] We are the word made flesh today.
[1:40:24] This is what the scriptures say.
[1:40:28] But you see, you can't just understand
[1:40:31] it.
[1:40:33] Your head will bust. You have to receive
[1:40:35] it by revenge.
[1:40:39] But when temptation comes,
[1:40:41] you can be bold before temptation
[1:40:46] and speak the word.
[1:40:50] When you speak the word, that word.
[1:40:56] Hallelujah. That's what meant.
[1:40:59] That word will overcome the devil
[1:41:03] any place, any time, anywhere, any
[1:41:07] situation. Which word? That word which
[1:41:10] you speak by revelation.
[1:41:15] Hallelujah.
[1:41:17] Thank you Jesus.
[1:41:19] How will the rapture be?
[1:41:22] Amen. It's not flying like flying
[1:41:25] saucers.
[1:41:27] We are going to walk into another
[1:41:30] by revelation. You will know how to walk
[1:41:33] in.
[1:41:34] By revelation, you will know how to put
[1:41:37] off this flesh
[1:41:38] and how to dress on another by
[1:41:41] revelation.
[1:41:43] It's happening now.
[1:41:45] It's a process.
[1:41:47] Something is happening
[1:41:49] on the inside and slowly is manifesting
[1:41:54] on the outside.
[1:41:56] The bride realizing who she is.
[1:42:04] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:42:07] See
[1:42:08] Jesus stood I will not go through it
[1:42:12] again. Then in John we read where he was
[1:42:13] with the disciples where he was with the
[1:42:16] Jews
[1:42:18] and they kept on asking him question.
[1:42:20] And when he said before Abraham was I am
[1:42:25] they said you are crazy. You are a
[1:42:27] Samaritan. You are crazy. You have a
[1:42:29] devil in you. We have to stone you. We
[1:42:33] have to kill you. And they wanted to
[1:42:35] kill you because they thought he's a man
[1:42:39] making himself.
[1:42:41] So my brother, grow in faith.
[1:42:45] You are not just a man.
[1:42:49] You are not just a woman.
[1:42:52] Amen. Hallelujah. That must be the
[1:42:55] revelation.
[1:42:58] The believers in the dark ages.
[1:43:02] They said, "Kill us. Kill me also." What
[1:43:06] happened to them? Their minds. Have they
[1:43:08] gone crazy?
[1:43:10] had seen that there was another land
[1:43:14] where they came from.
[1:43:17] This one doesn't count for anything.
[1:43:20] When brother left his flesh, he looked
[1:43:24] down. He saw the mugs and everything
[1:43:29] lowered down. This body looked down.
[1:43:32] He didn't want to come back.
[1:43:35] brother. That's why when you realize who
[1:43:38] you are, you will stop wanting if you're
[1:43:41] a woman to use makeup and
[1:43:46] you will throw them away. The happy that
[1:43:48] you will be lost
[1:43:51] that desire for the minisc automatically
[1:43:55] you lose it.
[1:43:58] And those who see you as a human being,
[1:44:00] they will say what's wrong with you?
[1:44:03] But you who sees yourself as more than a
[1:44:06] human being,
[1:44:08] you know you are not natural.
[1:44:11] You are super
[1:44:15] hallelujah. This is the victory that
[1:44:18] overcome the world.
[1:44:20] Amen. Hallelujah. To know there is
[1:44:24] something more
[1:44:27] than what we see.
[1:44:29] Amen. We are sons of God.
[1:44:33] To be a son of God means to be God.
[1:44:39] That's what it means. So you are God.
[1:44:44] You are you are but the Bible says you
[1:44:45] are a messiah height.
[1:44:52] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You are not just
[1:44:55] a piece of clay.
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:44:59] This house of grace
[1:45:01] going to b wide open
[1:45:05] bone
[1:45:07] that hold my soul.
[1:45:10] See one time when it bust wide open
[1:45:14] we come out.
[1:45:16] Can you realize pastor? I remember what
[1:45:19] you were preaching.
[1:45:21] I can now truly see who I am. And I'll
[1:45:24] tell you yes. That's what I was saying.
[1:45:27] This is your true origin.
[1:45:32] If you think you born in
[1:45:35] you,
[1:45:37] change your mind.
[1:45:40] Hallelujah. They may bury your body
[1:45:42] there. It doesn't matter how you get in.
[1:45:47] It matters how you come out.
[1:45:50] You may be so rich. We know about
[1:45:53] Alexander the Great.
[1:45:56] He was a rich king. He had everything
[1:45:59] all the gold and but when he became
[1:46:01] sick, no doctor could heal him. He died
[1:46:06] a sick man. But he said, "I wanted to
[1:46:09] put my hands off the coffin.
[1:46:13] I want everybody to know we come into
[1:46:16] the world with nothing.
[1:46:18] We go away with nothing.
[1:46:20] I want to go over the goal. Let
[1:46:22] everybody step by.
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:29] Let them know the riches of this world.
[1:46:32] They are nothing.
[1:46:37] I want the best doctors
[1:46:39] in our country to carry my casket.
[1:46:45] No doctor can heal you.
[1:46:49] No doctor has the medicine to heal you.
[1:46:52] It's only God who has authority over.
[1:46:55] So you may go in your grave
[1:46:58] as a lame person as a sick person, as a
[1:47:02] blind person. But I tell you what, the
[1:47:05] grave is not your origin.
[1:47:07] You have an origin.
[1:47:10] You came from God. You go back to God.
[1:47:14] You will come out. Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:47:17] Square.
[1:47:18] There is no lamb. There is no blind.
[1:47:22] There is no lustful.
[1:47:24] There is no weak. There is no poor
[1:47:27] person. Hallelujah.
[1:47:30] Everybody is perfect.
[1:47:33] Everybody's holy.
[1:47:36] Holy as God is holy. You know what? That
[1:47:40] is our true origin.
[1:47:43] Friend, when you get to know it,
[1:47:46] you just lose your mind.
[1:47:50] meaning you will get to see what others
[1:47:54] can't see
[1:47:56] and you'll get to speak what others
[1:47:57] can't see
[1:47:59] and they will call you crazy
[1:48:02] but they are the ones who have lost
[1:48:03] their mind
[1:48:08] when you come to yourself
[1:48:10] shake up yourself you say hey I can't
[1:48:13] live in fornication
[1:48:16] no that's too Lord,
[1:48:20] I have a better life.
[1:48:22] I'm a royal priesthood.
[1:48:26] The world thinks there are no people who
[1:48:30] can live holy.
[1:48:34] The Bible says be holy
[1:48:36] even as he is holy. And the world says
[1:48:39] it is impossible. But there are people
[1:48:43] still in flesh like Jesus was who know
[1:48:47] it is possible
[1:48:49] because they living just that
[1:48:53] not by their power
[1:48:55] by their mind.
[1:48:57] Something that keeps holding you
[1:49:00] because you receive a revelation
[1:49:03] of your true origin.
[1:49:06] Hallelujah. Amen. Friends, it's an
[1:49:10] exciting revelation.
[1:49:14] You see the the the disciples came to
[1:49:17] him.
[1:49:19] Excuse me. The father and mother came.
[1:49:22] They said, Mary said, "H Jesus, you boy,
[1:49:28] your father and I have been looking for
[1:49:30] you.
[1:49:33] Your father, my father, and you. Who do
[1:49:38] you think you are?
[1:49:41] They thought he was a boy,
[1:49:44] a little Jew.
[1:49:47] He told them, "Don't you know I must be
[1:49:51] about my father's business?
[1:49:55] Mary rejected the virgin birth.
[1:50:02] He told
[1:50:04] you know it is women who give children."
[1:50:07] So he told Jesus, "Your father is
[1:50:10] Joseph."
[1:50:12] Jesus said, "Hey, correction,
[1:50:14] correction."
[1:50:16] He is not my father.
[1:50:19] The f the business he was carrying out
[1:50:22] was not Joseph's business. Joseph's
[1:50:25] business was carpentry.
[1:50:29] The business he was doing in the temple
[1:50:32] was his father's business. Who was his
[1:50:35] father? So who is he? A son of God. So
[1:50:38] who is his father? God.
[1:50:41] Hallelujah. Jesus knew who he was. He
[1:50:45] knew he was God
[1:50:47] in flesh.
[1:50:50] You should also know who you are. When
[1:50:53] your mother says, "Look at this one."
[1:50:57] That's why you are stupid in your clan.
[1:51:00] You just laugh and say, "You don't know
[1:51:02] what you're talking about." In our clan,
[1:51:05] we are perfect.
[1:51:09] I come from God. I go back to God.
[1:51:14] God bless you, brother M.
[1:51:17] That's where we come from.
[1:51:20] All these foolish things of that happen
[1:51:23] in this world.
[1:51:26] That's why all the covenants
[1:51:28] that your grandfathers made
[1:51:31] and they have been binding all the
[1:51:33] children in that lineage.
[1:51:35] You come to a place when you pass into
[1:51:38] this revelation
[1:51:40] and you say
[1:51:42] all those don't belong to me. They are
[1:51:46] to me to me
[1:51:49] all these covenants.
[1:51:51] I am in a new covenant.
[1:51:54] My father is Jesus Christ.
[1:51:56] and I am his son
[1:51:58] and also he's my brother.
[1:52:01] He's my mother. He's my friend. He's my
[1:52:04] everything.
[1:52:06] Don't you see? It sounds like crazy,
[1:52:10] but they are the ones who are crazy
[1:52:12] because they have no revelation
[1:52:15] of who you are.
[1:52:17] Amen. Jesus told them, I am here doing
[1:52:21] my father's. That's why no matter what
[1:52:23] you're doing in this world, brother, you
[1:52:27] may have a good job, it doesn't count.
[1:52:32] What you saw in your father's business
[1:52:34] matters.
[1:52:38] We have to have revelation, friends.
[1:52:41] The time you give to the Lord,
[1:52:44] the money you give to the work of God,
[1:52:47] the Bible says, make yourselves friends
[1:52:50] of the unrighteous mmon.
[1:52:55] But when you fail,
[1:52:58] it will deliver you in the into the
[1:53:00] harvesting.
[1:53:04] You know what?
[1:53:06] Money. How can money do something after
[1:53:10] you are dead?
[1:53:13] is what you did with it when you were
[1:53:15] you on earth
[1:53:20] to sew into the kingdom of God into the
[1:53:23] work of God. Amen.
[1:53:26] Because you knew your father's business
[1:53:30] when you passed from this life.
[1:53:33] Well done my good and faith.
[1:53:38] Whatever you are doing, it's a job, it's
[1:53:41] a whatever business, whatever, focus on
[1:53:46] doing your father's business.
[1:53:49] That's why even if you're a worker,
[1:53:52] you serve your boss as unto the Lord,
[1:53:57] do it well to the glory of God. Do it
[1:54:01] for the children of God.
[1:54:03] Do it for God. Do it for the children of
[1:54:05] God. God so that you will gain.
[1:54:09] Don't be selfish. Don't be
[1:54:11] self-centered.
[1:54:13] That's a man who doesn't know who they
[1:54:14] are. But he who knows who they are.
[1:54:18] They'll realize it's not about me as a
[1:54:21] human being. It's about me as a son of
[1:54:24] God
[1:54:26] and about my brother and about my sister
[1:54:30] as a as as a daughter of God.
[1:54:33] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:54:35] The thief on the cross will finish with
[1:54:36] this now. I've not even read any quote
[1:54:39] or anything and I wanted to but it's all
[1:54:42] right. So see this man factor.
[1:54:45] There were two of them hanged on each
[1:54:49] side of Jesus
[1:54:51] and one of them came to Jesus rather not
[1:54:55] coming but he spoke to Jesus. He said to
[1:54:58] him, "If thou be the Christ,
[1:55:03] does that sound familiar?
[1:55:06] If thou be the son of God,
[1:55:09] command his stones to be made bread,
[1:55:13] brother."
[1:55:14] Here's another if.
[1:55:18] If thou be Christ, the devil and and his
[1:55:22] sons,
[1:55:24] the devil and his serpent seed,
[1:55:28] The serpent and his seed
[1:55:33] has always doubted
[1:55:36] who Jesus is.
[1:55:39] Amen. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[1:55:42] serpent and his seat
[1:55:44] today doubt who you are.
[1:55:49] Hallelujah.
[1:55:51] What? The bride of Christ, perfect
[1:55:54] people, rapture. There is no such a
[1:55:57] group of people like that.
[1:56:00] All churches are deceived. Deceive one.
[1:56:04] They just don't know. They will always
[1:56:06] doubt you.
[1:56:08] They will mistake you for others.
[1:56:11] They did the same to Jesus.
[1:56:14] And this m fact I said if thou be the
[1:56:16] Christ save us and yourself
[1:56:21] they always want to see a miracle or
[1:56:22] sign a wonder.
[1:56:26] Can you imagine? Same thing happened
[1:56:28] with the devil.
[1:56:29] He wanted to see a miracle.
[1:56:33] And that's why the world is so hungry
[1:56:36] for miracles.
[1:56:40] Did you know that? Look at all the mega
[1:56:42] churches.
[1:56:44] Why are they mega? Because the the
[1:56:47] leaders of those churches
[1:56:49] are claiming to do miracles.
[1:56:54] That is what makes the mega churches.
[1:56:58] Did Jesus have a mega church? Yes. At
[1:57:01] one point,
[1:57:03] why? Because of the miracles he did,
[1:57:09] he turned fish into many fish.
[1:57:14] [Music]
[1:57:16] They all came. They all came. How many?
[1:57:19] 5,000 10,000 15,000. There were more
[1:57:22] than 15,000.
[1:57:27] Jesus had a mega church.
[1:57:31] And then he began after the miracles. He
[1:57:35] said, "All right, all right, all right.
[1:57:37] Let us open the
[1:57:40] the seventh seal now.
[1:57:46] What?
[1:57:49] No, no, no, no, no, no. Please give us
[1:57:52] the first pool.
[1:57:56] Give us the second pool.
[1:58:00] This third pool is very difficult for
[1:58:02] us.
[1:58:06] It sounds as if you're a C.
[1:58:09] We want the power
[1:58:11] the miracle then we shall come. He said
[1:58:15] you can go
[1:58:19] and that's why the message churches
[1:58:23] are the smallest in the world.
[1:58:27] Why? Because they are the only churches
[1:58:31] which are operating in the third realm.
[1:58:34] the third phase of the ministry of Jesus
[1:58:37] Christ.
[1:58:41] And Jesus answer asked them, "Do you
[1:58:44] also want to go?" He said, "No, who can
[1:58:47] we go that has the word
[1:58:51] of eternal life?"
[1:58:53] The bride all over the world
[1:58:56] is interested in the world,
[1:58:59] in the opening of the world.
[1:59:03] Yes sir. Amen. And so here write again
[1:59:09] the male factors
[1:59:12] they they told uh Jesus
[1:59:15] save yourself and us you on the cross
[1:59:18] like us do a miracle somehow. Let's get
[1:59:22] off the cross.
[1:59:25] Did Jesus answer that?
[1:59:29] Read your Bible. Go go go go go go back
[1:59:31] and read it very well. Luke 239
[1:59:36] Jesus answered nothing
[1:59:44] do a miracle for us. That's why in the
[1:59:46] in the dark ages when they persecuting
[1:59:52] killing them Jesus never did miracles
[1:59:54] for them.
[1:59:58] What did he do? He said, "I know.
[2:00:04] I know you're suffering
[2:00:07] the suffering of this present time
[2:00:10] is not worthy
[2:00:12] to to be compared with the glory shall
[2:00:16] be revealed here.
[2:00:21] The bride is preparing herself
[2:00:24] for the body change.
[2:00:27] Hallelujah.
[2:00:29] And right here, friends,
[2:00:33] right here,
[2:00:36] the other answered him.
[2:00:39] And I want you to see the other thief on
[2:00:42] the cross.
[2:00:44] And he rebuked this one. He said, "What?
[2:00:48] Don't you fear God?"
[2:00:51] Who told this man,
[2:00:53] Sister M? Think about it.
[2:00:56] Who told this man
[2:00:58] that this was God?
[2:01:03] Have you thought about it?
[2:01:06] It was by revelation.
[2:01:10] Hallelujah.
[2:01:12] The other one said, "If you be the
[2:01:14] Christ,"
[2:01:17] and this one said, "Don't you fear God?"
[2:01:22] saying, "Thou art come in the same
[2:01:25] condemnation.
[2:01:27] Indeed, we justly
[2:01:30] for we receive the due reward of our
[2:01:31] deeds."
[2:01:33] This man has done nothing. How did he
[2:01:37] know that?
[2:01:40] Revelation.
[2:01:42] And he said unto Jesus,
[2:01:45] now if you were doubting whether he knew
[2:01:47] whether he was God or not, listen.
[2:01:50] And he turned to Jesus and he said,
[2:01:53] "Lord,
[2:01:56] Lord,
[2:02:02] Isaiah 42, I am the Lord. That is my
[2:02:06] name." Amen. A praise. I will not give
[2:02:09] to any grave in the image.
[2:02:12] I am the Lord. You see, he said that is
[2:02:15] my name.
[2:02:17] Here is a thief on the cross
[2:02:20] who had never read Isaiah 42.
[2:02:26] We can say that Paul
[2:02:29] said, "Who are you my Lord?"
[2:02:33] Paul was a scholar.
[2:02:35] He must have read it somewhere. But this
[2:02:38] one had never read. He was a thief.
[2:02:42] He was a sinner.
[2:02:44] Never been in any church service.
[2:02:48] And he's saying to Jesus, Lord,
[2:02:52] remember me. When thou comest into thy
[2:02:56] kingdom,
[2:02:59] how did he know this man has a kingdom?
[2:03:02] He must have known who he was.
[2:03:05] When you receive a revelation
[2:03:07] of who Jesus Christ is, you are the
[2:03:10] church.
[2:03:12] Now you are on the foundation
[2:03:15] upon this rock, I will build my church
[2:03:18] and the gate of hell shall not prevail
[2:03:22] against.
[2:03:23] And this man by realizing who Jesus is.
[2:03:29] Amen. He had been laid on the
[2:03:33] foundation.
[2:03:35] Upon this rock, I would be in my church.
[2:03:38] Please listen to me as I'm finishing. At
[2:03:41] this moment, this man became the church.
[2:03:46] Hallelujah. Are you getting it, sister?
[2:03:48] This man became the child
[2:03:52] because he had received a revelation and
[2:03:55] he said upon this revelation
[2:03:57] of what? Of who Jesus Christ is. So he
[2:04:01] had received a revelation of who Jesus
[2:04:03] is and on that very moment he became the
[2:04:08] church. And that's why Jesus could not
[2:04:12] be silent.
[2:04:14] Hallelujah. Jesus will not be silent.
[2:04:18] When you know who he is, brother, when
[2:04:21] you know who he is, sister
[2:04:23] Jesus will not be silent on you.
[2:04:30] Hallelujah. In that day before they
[2:04:33] call, I will answer.
[2:04:38] That's the millennium.
[2:04:41] But potentially because we're in
[2:04:43] heavenly places,
[2:04:46] we claim it even today.
[2:04:48] [Music]
[2:04:50] What is your need?
[2:04:52] Before you call, he will answer.
[2:04:57] Before you call, he will answer. Amen.
[2:05:01] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Jesus said unto
[2:05:03] him, verily I say unto thee, today
[2:05:09] my my myle. Oh, I feel so good right
[2:05:12] now. Today, tell somebody today.
[2:05:17] Today shalt thou be with me
[2:05:20] in paradise?
[2:05:23] Oh, can someone preach with me right
[2:05:24] now?
[2:05:26] Amen. What is your desire? If you have
[2:05:29] received a revelation of who Jesus
[2:05:31] Christ is to you and you know who you
[2:05:34] are, you are the church. And I said to
[2:05:37] you right now today, you shall receive
[2:05:40] your
[2:05:43] Amen. And Jesus taught to the man and
[2:05:46] said, "Today,
[2:05:48] thou shalt be with me in paradise."
[2:05:52] Does Jesus mean what he's saying?
[2:05:55] Does he mean what?
[2:05:58] Does he say what he mean
[2:06:01] is the same yesterday?
[2:06:04] Today,
[2:06:06] today,
[2:06:08] and forever.
[2:06:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:06:12] Hallelujah. You remember there was
[2:06:15] something I was preaching some time back
[2:06:17] and a revelation struck me. I said how
[2:06:20] many want clothing?
[2:06:22] All those people got clos
[2:06:31] spoken word
[2:06:33] spoken word and things will be
[2:06:35] manifested.
[2:06:37] So what do you need today?
[2:06:40] If you need to overcome sin,
[2:06:44] if you are here right now and you want
[2:06:46] to overcome sin in the name of Jesus,
[2:06:50] you're overcoming right now. God is
[2:06:53] giving you power,
[2:06:55] right in your body, right in your
[2:06:57] spirit.
[2:06:59] You may be online right now. I don't
[2:07:00] care where you are. Everybody stand up
[2:07:02] on your feet. The Lord is giving you
[2:07:05] grace. He's giving you strength right
[2:07:07] now. And you are overcoming right now.
[2:07:10] You're over. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:07:13] S received strength.
[2:07:16] S received strength.
[2:07:18] Listen, brother. S received strength.
[2:07:22] In her body, she was barren. But when
[2:07:25] the strength came, she was able to bring
[2:07:28] forth a child.
[2:07:30] In the name of Jesus Christ, you are
[2:07:32] receiving strength
[2:07:34] right now. If you receive that
[2:07:37] revelation,
[2:07:38] what do you need to overcome? Come on,
[2:07:41] don't walk away. Don't walk away. Still
[2:07:44] defeated. You are receiving strength
[2:07:46] now. S never felt anything. You may not
[2:07:50] feel anything, but the word of God is
[2:07:54] creative.
[2:07:57] You are receiving strength right now.
[2:08:00] for your need. For your need.
[2:08:05] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. Everybody
[2:08:07] begin to worship the Lord.
[2:08:09] Begin to pray and call on the name of
[2:08:11] the Lord.
[2:08:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you,
[2:08:16] Jesus.
[2:08:19] Hallelujah, Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:08:23] Oh yes, Lord Jesus.
[2:08:26] Hallelujah, Lord.

[2:08:32] Oh, strike everybody with your
[2:08:34] revelation, Lord.
[2:08:36] Let them know who you are.
[2:08:38] Let them know who you are that they may
[2:08:41] know who they are in this evil hour.
[2:08:45] They will overcome
[2:08:47] and live beyond what they see and live
[2:08:50] beyond their failures and live beyond
[2:08:53] their sin and live beyond their problems
[2:08:56] and live beyond their failures and live
[2:08:58] beyond their weaknesses in the name of
[2:09:01] Jesus Christ. Yes, Lord. May you let
[2:09:05] your spirit move
[2:09:07] and do the miraculous Lord because
[2:09:10] you're the miracle working.
[2:09:12] You never fail Lord. You are the I am
[2:09:15] that I am. You're the present God right
[2:09:18] now.
[2:09:20] Yes, Lord Jesus.

[2:09:24] today.
[2:09:26] You can receive today.
[2:09:28] I tell you, test and see.
[2:09:31] That the Lord is good
[2:09:36] and his faithfulness
[2:09:39] is new every morning.

[2:16:15] Hallelujah.
[2:16:18] Thank you, Jesus. Yes, you have redeemed
[2:16:21] me, oh God.
[2:16:24] You have redeemed us.
[2:16:26] Brought us into the kingdom of your dear
[2:16:27] son.
[2:16:29] We are standing here, Lord.
[2:16:32] Oh, because
[2:16:35] we are redeemed.
[2:16:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,

[2:18:14] and it looks as if it was over,
[2:18:19] you
[2:18:22] made our way.
[2:18:28] And we're standing
[2:18:30] here
[2:18:32] only because

[2:20:18] When our backs were against the wall
[2:20:23] and it looked as if it was over.
[2:20:28] You
[2:20:30] made our way.
[2:20:36] Understanding
[2:20:38] it
[2:20:40] only because you made

[2:20:49] Let's pray. Lord Jesus,
[2:20:53] we are so thrilled, Lord,
[2:20:55] [Music]
[2:20:57] because you are God,
[2:21:01] not 2,000 years ago.
[2:21:05] Not a God to come, but a God that is
[2:21:08] here with us
[2:21:10] and in us revealed in us
[2:21:15] in this bright coming of Jesus Christ.
[2:21:19] Lord, may we receive that revelation
[2:21:23] of what you're doing in this house.
[2:21:26] Bring us closer to you, Lord.
[2:21:30] Closer to you,
[2:21:32] closer to you. Give us the desire, the
[2:21:36] hunger to feed more on the message
[2:21:41] that we may grow in the stage of Christ.
[2:21:46] Lord, this people, Father, love you.
[2:21:50] We don't want to confuse them.
[2:21:52] We want them to know you
[2:21:55] give them a hunger, more hunger
[2:21:58] that the more they eat of the Lord,
[2:22:01] the more they will know who you are
[2:22:04] and know who they are,
[2:22:07] we will know our true origin.
[2:22:11] And Lord, thereby we might be able to
[2:22:12] know the exploits which we can do
[2:22:17] and the authority which we will
[2:22:19] by the power of revelation.
[2:22:22] Bless each one of us father. Lord even
[2:22:25] as we give of our offerings Lord
[2:22:27] the tith bless every giver
[2:22:31] that those who will give with revelation
[2:22:33] Lord
[2:22:34] you grant unto them that which they
[2:22:37] desire.
[2:22:39] And I pray, oh God, that as we shall go
[2:22:40] to our homes tonight,
[2:22:43] you will let the Holy Spirit
[2:22:46] go with us. And may we go meditating on
[2:22:49] this word
[2:22:51] such as we have had tonight. Bless those
[2:22:53] that have been fellowshipping with us
[2:22:56] online. Be with them, Lord, and every
[2:22:58] desire that they have
