[8:33] and the Lord went before them by day in
[8:36] a pillar of cloud to lead them the way
[8:40] and by night in the pillar of fire to
[8:43] give them light to go by day and by
[8:48] night

[9:30] about the pillar of Fire

[9:36] even uh
[9:39] there is the picture of the Prophet
[9:43] which had that Hollow of light on his
[9:47] head

[10:23] because you will you cannot meet the
[10:26] pillar of fire
[10:29] and you remain the same
[10:31] and what we need tonight
[10:34] we need to encounter the pillar of fire

[10:43] Vindicated by God himself

[10:57] blessed to be the name of the Lamb come
[10:59] and give us the angel you can call him

[11:12] the Bible says that Moses went before
[11:15] them and the Lord went before them in
[11:19] the pillar of clouds
[11:26] remember in Old Testament
[11:29] nobody couldn't see God face to face
[11:33] and uh remember another thing the
[11:37] expression of Israel out of Egypt
[11:41] it was done by God himself
[11:45] praise the Lord and God was putting on
[11:48] that period he was hiding the pillar of
[11:50] clouds
[11:53] give them shade from the Sun
[11:57] according
[12:00] to lead them in the way
[12:03] because they didn't know where they were
[12:05] going
[12:07] when God called them
[12:17] [Applause]
[12:52] to lead them
[12:57] praise the Lord
[12:59] he knows the way
[13:01] he knew where he was taking them
[13:04] that was his work
[13:07] praise be to God because he was leading
[13:10] them through the way
[13:12] Jesus said I'm the way of the truth
[13:19] nobody can go to the father
[13:22] enters
[13:25] praise be to God so God knew where he
[13:28] was taking them
[13:30] and he was doing the work of redemption
[13:39] Pillar of Fire

[13:57] amen
[14:04] and he says
[14:06] by night in the pillar of fire to give
[14:10] them the light yet
[14:18] if it is
[14:29] running here and there
[14:32] praise the Lord man where we are living
[14:36] today
[14:37] the Bible tells us in Isaiah
[14:40] of the gross Darkness

[14:49] fire again

[16:04] pride

[18:55] got older
[18:58] even work lovers never caught
[19:03] blessed with the name of the Lord what
[19:06] man is not to happen
[19:08] that was the presence of the pillar of
[19:11] fire

[19:57] hope then what happens
[20:02] take care of them to take care of their
[20:06] knees says
[20:15] that you see some time you are looking
[20:18] at the messenger instead of the message
[20:24] and God shut the door no matter it was
[20:27] talking about the time of nowhere
[20:30] when Noah came preaching the ghosts
[20:34] he was despised
[20:36] but no hard the voice of God
[20:43] because when God met him he was there
[20:47] alone the other voice alone
[20:53] amen so Noah was under instructions
[20:59] like during the first Exodus
[21:02] the children of Israel when under
[21:05] instructions
[21:09] [Music]
[21:15] was to keep them in the way yeah
[21:21] [Applause]
[21:28] praise the Lord no matter how
[21:30] kind-hearted Noah was
[21:34] [Applause]
[21:37] shutting and opening whatever he wants
[21:43] because he heard the voice of God
[21:47] he was following the instructions
[22:02] told him the kind of tree was supposed
[22:05] to use
[22:07] blessed be the name of the Lord and this
[22:10] man was following instructions
[22:13] he had a message for his foreign
[23:15] foreign
[24:01] [Applause]
[24:16] [Applause]
[24:38] but what was coming out of Moses

[26:28] that's where is the one who knows the
[26:31] way

[27:46] listening to oh much
[27:57] what are you listening to tonight
[28:02] blessed with the name of the Lord
[28:06] amen Mina
[28:08] the reason as to why
[28:11] in Pentecostal nomination
[28:17] you find people are not changing
[28:21] it is because of what they are listening
[28:24] to in sunga kubanga is

[28:33] because you come as you are and you go
[28:37] back the same not that your church it is
[28:39] because of what we are listening to
[28:41] shift
[28:42] blessed be the name of the Lord but if
[28:45] you listen to this Holy Ghost Gospel
[28:49] God will settle your heart on fire
[28:53] the desperation
[28:59] amen because you will know that you
[29:03] don't need comedy

[39:49] seven times
[39:54] probably some of them even put the ear
[39:57] to hear what is going on
[39:59] but the world probably was becoming
[40:02] Harder by by their physical eyes
[40:05] but let me tell you something

[41:25] this man did not mind about any other
[41:27] thing is
[41:33] Peter who asked
[41:36] started following him
[41:40] amen amen when Elijah met Elijah
[41:45] Metallica
[41:46] he came and hit on him
[41:50] and then he moved you know again this
[41:53] man knew

[41:59] that was the hand of God
[42:03] yes send me the name of the Lord
[42:07] praise be to God
[42:09] amen amen but if you let God hear he
[42:13] says in in the message putting on the
[42:15] whole armor of God
[42:18] he will just let God do it
[42:22] it will get the word in you
[42:26] blessed be the name of the Lord if you
[42:29] read if you read uh in John chapter 15
[42:32] verses

[42:48] through the words you are hearing
[42:51] already
[42:52] that's what Jesus said yes you are now
[42:55] clean
[42:57] through the world
[43:04] the word in you it is the washing
[43:09] praise be to God it was the word in the
[43:12] prophets
[43:15] it was the word in the sun
[43:18] it was the word in you today
[43:22] it is the word prophesied
[43:26] amen prophesied promise
[43:31] blessed with the name of the Lord
[43:34] so what are we following tonight

[44:28] the sound of time
[44:30] footprint or the sound of time
[44:37] praise to God
[44:40] and the story goes like this
[44:44] [Music]
[44:46] he saw that he saw
[44:49] or sometimes it's true Footprints you
[44:56] and when when it reaches the hard times
[45:04] and then he was complaining to the Lord
[45:08] but when things are okay
[45:13] that's when he moves with the Lord
[45:18] but when things become hard
[45:22] it's him moving alone
[45:25] but let me tell you Brothers many times
[45:28] when we are going through our situations
[45:41] amen because it's a Good Shepherd of the
[45:44] ship or I am assume if you've ever read

[45:53] going into the thickets
[45:56] and there is the little lamb which you
[45:58] know that cannot maneuver maybe sons
[46:03] of ever red animals
[46:10] praise be to God man that is what God
[46:13] does
[46:14] that's why God gave us the pillar of
