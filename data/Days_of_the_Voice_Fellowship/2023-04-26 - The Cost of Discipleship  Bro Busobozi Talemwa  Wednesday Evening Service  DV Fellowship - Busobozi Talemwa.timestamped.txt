[19:23] verses 25.
[19:30] and I'm going to read after verses 33.
[19:37] and there went great multitudes with him

[19:50] father
[19:51] and mother and wife and children and

[20:50] less happily after he has laid the
[20:52] foundation and is not able to finish it
[20:54] all that behold it begin to mock him
[20:57] saying this man began to be old and was
[21:01] not able to finish or what king going to
[21:04] war against another king sits not down
[21:07] fast and consulted whether he be able to
[21:10] uh with the ten thousand meet him that
[21:15] cometh against him with the twenty
[21:18] thousand or else while the other is yet
[21:21] a great way of
[21:22] he sent it on
[21:25] um
[21:26] ambassage and desireth
[21:29] conditions of peace so likewise
[21:32] whosoever he be of you
[21:36] that forsaketh not
[21:38] all that he has he cannot be my disciple
[21:44] foreign
[22:43] Amina
[22:52] our good Lord we thank you for the world
[22:58] bless us and speak to us
[23:00] you know the desires of our souls
[23:03] I need to hear from you we surrender
[23:07] ourselves to you now in the name of our
[23:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[23:11] you may be seated
[23:13] God bless you
[23:16] like I said I'm happy to see you
[23:20] know that the Lord has granted us the
[23:24] grace to meet again today
[23:29] only it is by his grace
[23:30] [Music]
[23:32] amen me
[23:34] amen I mean
[23:37] enjoyed Sunday
[23:40] amen amen our men are going to enjoy
[23:43] today
[23:47] you know whenever I go to church
[23:50] I'm expecting to hear something
[23:54] I'm expecting
[23:57] Sister Martin I'm happy to see that he
[23:59] made it tonight
[24:00] so whenever I go to church I'm expecting
[24:06] praise the name of the Lord so let me
[24:09] trust that each of you is expected
[24:13] I ask your neighbor you expected
[24:49] I don't know I might continue with this
[24:51] on Sunday or I might just I do not know
[24:53] how the Lord will let us see
[25:13] [Music]
[25:16] not really on me but on what I'm saying
[25:21] let us hear what the spirit is telling
[25:24] us
[26:05] now the geography teacher can't
[26:07] understand what I'm talking about
[26:09] so opportunity costs opportunity cost
[26:12] you see is described as the cost that is
[26:16] foregone
[26:18] opportunity costs
[26:24] or rather what I can say is the foregone
[26:27] benefits
[26:30] that would have been derived from an
[26:33] option not chosen
[26:36] oh
[26:46] [Music]
[26:53] you understand for example if
[26:58] there are two choices that you are
[27:00] supposed to take
[27:02] videos and you decide to choose one of
[27:06] them
[27:08] the other one you did not choose
[27:12] is had benefits
[27:16] and you decided to foreign
[27:45] sometimes bring about a high opportunity
[27:48] cost
[27:53] follow me follow me just closely here I
[27:56] mean I've already described what
[27:57] opportunity cost is now we are in an
[28:00] economics class this evening
[28:06] everything he said we can't understand
[28:09] it if you don't understand opportunity
[28:10] costs
[28:14] and I just told you opportunity for the
[28:17] sake of my brother opportunity costs
[28:19] opportunity cost in business
[28:26] that would have come out of the other
[28:29] option that you have not taken
[28:35] so now I'm saying in business
[28:38] a good decision if a person let's say if
[28:41] a person makes a good decision business
[28:43] decisions
[28:47] sometimes
[28:51] it might make what we call losses
[29:04] let me give you examples if someone is
[29:08] employed
[29:09] in a company
[29:12] and they are paying him twenty thousand
[29:15] years
[29:18] and then he decides to leave that
[29:20] company
[29:22] and starts his own business
[29:26] he gets uh 10 000 profits a year
[29:31] so the opportunity cost is
[29:35] is by by within a period of time
[29:41] it would seem he is losing ten thousand
[29:44] every year
[29:47] that is the opportunity
[29:50] that's what it cost to him
[29:53] is
[30:12] the opportunity costs
[30:19] it seems as if he has made a loss
[30:22] [Music]
[30:24] I'm going to nail it until you
[30:26] understand
[30:30] if someone was having a job
[30:34] right and he's getting twenty thousand
[30:38] Shillings
[30:39] and leaves the job and starts a business
[30:48] is he is he okay
[30:55] one person here who understands the
[30:57] economics said yes
[31:00] but in reality
[31:02] has he made any money
[31:06] he is not initially he was being
[31:08] employed
[31:10] getting twenty thousand profits
[31:14] but now he's employing himself
[31:18] but only earning ten thousands
[31:21] how much do you lose
[31:31] good day
[31:33] yes we all agree the losers
[31:37] look at the big picture
[31:42] you understand now do you think that he
[31:45] will continue to be a loser otherwise I
[31:48] guess
[31:50] it could be yes or no yeah
[31:54] from the type of business he has
[31:57] ventured into now
[32:00] against them it depends on the Dynamics
[32:03] in the market
[32:05] it depends on how he is invested
[32:08] invested into this business
[32:11] his life the investment the Investments
[32:16] you understand if he continues
[32:24] pushing into the business
[32:26] maybe after five years
[32:30] [Music]
[32:39] can it be compared
[32:43] the laws he suffered in the beginning
[32:46] [Music]
[32:56] a good decision
[33:00] to bring about a high opportunity cost
[33:02] in short terms
[33:13] [Music]
[33:14] you all understand that say Amen
[33:18] all right now this is a class of
[33:20] brilliant students
[33:22] in Christianity to be a disciple of
[33:26] Jesus
[33:27] I want to say there is also an
[33:30] opportunity
[33:36] [Applause]
[33:42] to be just to be his disciples
[33:50] you see to to be the Disciples of Jesus
[33:54] we give up Allah
[34:41] is a sure business
[34:48] is a sure business
[34:52] you know I told you
[34:54] that if someone or mundu enters into a
[34:58] business
[34:59] leaving his job
[35:02] when he's not too sure about his
[35:04] business
[35:07] it's a biggest mistake you can ever make
[35:12] but let me leave my teaching job
[35:17] and I go and ban the charcoal
[35:28] now you've
[35:31] now though you have been getting little
[35:33] money but you've been getting this and
[35:35] then you have gone to banjo
[35:37] now when you reach in charcoal even the
[35:40] little you were against you stop getting
[35:43] it that is
[35:46] things go wrong
[36:03] a business that never disappoints
[36:08] Hallelujah man this is the business of
[36:11] being a disciple of Jesus
[36:15] Amen being a follower of Jesus being a
[36:20] follower of the world
[36:22] if you follow the work
[36:26] you will never fail
[36:28] if you believe the word
[36:32] you can never
[36:34] you can't fall down you can never
[36:37] accidentally you the prophets are
[36:39] assured
[36:42] are you hearing what I'm saying look at
[36:45] your number following Jesus Christ
[36:48] what the Bible demands of us to do no
[36:52] one could call it bible church does not
[36:55] feel good in the first place
[36:58] yeah many Pleasures
[37:13] others they just go and cheats
[37:23] it seems as if it is enjoyable
[37:27] it seems as if it is
[37:30] [Music]
[37:34] because it makes you happy
[37:37] it is destruction
[37:41] but when you decide
[37:43] to be a Christian
[37:45] the reason why I'm preaching this today
[37:48] is
[37:49] I want us to understand
[37:55] of being a disciples
[37:57] you can't just follow something
[38:00] without thinking
[38:03] if you are leaving your job you have to
[38:06] think what business are you entering
[38:09] so let us not be Believers
[38:14] [Music]
[38:16] let us not be Believers without knowing
[38:20] the cross
[38:23] you should know what cause
[38:27] it is
[38:47] only your spirit
[38:51] you have decided
[38:54] to be a disciple
[38:57] but the problem that we have I want to
[39:00] ask you now let us go back to economics
[39:03] today foreign
[39:22] this man will be a double loser
[39:27] we have a lot of believers
[39:30] churches very mechanism
[39:35] you are not getting the world properly
[39:37] and see 24 numbers and you're not also
[39:40] getting Christianity and the word of God
[39:42] properly of Christianity
[39:48] you are not satisfied with the worldly
[39:51] things
[39:53] and even goddess
[39:56] you were there in the middle yeah
[39:59] you are not enjoying anything
[40:04] I want to be here
[40:06] following Jesus
[40:13] when I am enjoying what I'm doing
[40:16] when I enjoy it is
[40:26] foreign
[40:42] foreign
[41:49] foreign
[42:27] [Music]
[42:37] what what does the Bible say the Bible
[42:40] talks about a double-minded man Bible is
[42:44] what it says the devil-minded man
[42:50] all his ways
[42:54] we must not be double-minded
[42:58] we must be one-minded
[43:01] we are going to be Believers let us not
[43:05] be Sunday
[43:08] let us be believe us every day
[43:19] the Bible says it is better to see you
[43:23] welcome
[43:26] but the the last generation is
[43:37] foreign
[43:41] do you know how it's it feels on
[43:43] yourself
[43:46] you want to speed it up we're gonna go
[43:49] and do that it tastes funny
[43:52] but for me when I want water
[43:55] I love it
[44:01] these things of room temperature
[44:08] I want very cold
[44:13] and this is what God wants he says it is
[44:40] not be a fan of the world
[45:05] am I preaching to someone
[45:09] Overcomers
[45:33] that is the first thing
[45:36] is
[45:40] do you know that a Christian is not
[45:42] supposed to be in a situation where you
[45:43] look warm
[45:46] all the time you're the one begging
[45:48] foreign
[45:50] [Applause]
[46:12] huh
[46:53] foreign
[47:57] am I communicating
[47:59] sometimes it takes you to delete some
[48:02] contacts
[48:04] sometimes it takes you to separate
[48:07] yourself
[48:11] even change locations
[48:23] to focus on this message
[48:33] and decided to Bear the course
[48:36] and God never prospered
[48:39] if you show me one um
[48:43] foreign
[48:59] foreign
[49:26] stop
[49:42] in one second
[49:47] some people hospitals
[49:50] when the world is there when the brother
[49:53] is there your sister
[50:06] my goodness
[50:12] you when you find them chatting on their
[50:14] phones
[50:16] they are chatting as if they don't even
[50:18] know the name Jesus
[50:24] you see as if they have never known
[50:26] where Jesus is
[50:27] [Music]
[50:29] the spirit of a cockroach
[50:33] may God deliver you
[50:35] if there is
[50:51] if you can mean business
[50:57] count your losses
[51:04] for you to you know be a disciples when
[51:08] you accept
[51:09] amen you are accepted to undergo that
[51:13] opportunity
[51:15] say well yes this is what is going to
[51:18] cost me
[51:19] but it's all right I'm saving it for the
[51:23] future
[51:26] you can almost know the person who will
[51:28] be successful
[51:32] it's not hard
[51:35] it's not hard at all
[51:39] um
[52:03] what do we want in five years
[52:09] what are we going to be involved what is
[52:13] the vision
[52:14] what do we want our community
[52:18] what are we looking for you now it bring
[52:22] down to us

[52:51] you must know what you want God you may
[52:55] not have it right now but you must you
[52:58] must know it no you're not human yeah
[52:59] why do people go to Lottery
[53:03] watch why why do they kill others
[53:07] why do they go for betting again
[53:11] because they are not focused
[53:15] they realize it when it's too late
[53:29] wanted to run to the king
[53:32] it wasn't his time
[53:34] so it was the wrong time and he was the
[53:38] wrong woman
[53:42] he didn't accomplish anything
[53:48] I don't want to arrive at things in my
[53:50] life
[53:52] before my time
[53:56] are you hearing what I'm saying
[53:59] you want to be serious with God
[54:03] you want to be like Khushi you want to
[54:07] be focused you have to take your time
[54:14] to see your future
[54:16] being Believers does not mean we just
[54:20] believe without reasoning
[54:25] with the word
[54:28] God has given us reasons
[54:31] to use it on us here
[54:54] be faithful
[54:56] this is what God wants for us
[55:00] you see if because what I'm saying if
[55:03] you you count your cost
[55:06] and you know you were a child of God
[55:13] will increase it 100 100
[55:22] you cannot continue
[55:24] saying you're a Believers
[55:29] but you are there calling every girl and
[55:33] boy
[55:38] and even the people
[55:42] because there are many young people who
[55:44] listen to this
[55:48] so if the Lord gives me an anointing to
[55:50] speak about something I speak about it
[55:54] so please help me you were here
[55:58] that by the time we leave this place it
[56:01] would have gotten home Amina man
[56:08] the Lord will give you Grace to remove
[56:10] and be healed
[56:13] praise the name of the Lord
[56:23] um when you see in Luke
[56:25] 14 28 where we read
[56:28] Jesus said which of you
[56:32] pretending to build a tower
[56:35] sits not down fast
[56:42] whether he has enough money to finish
[56:44] that over innocence
[56:54] [Music]
[57:00] I
[57:02] want to say every important thing
[57:04] involves counting the cause
[57:08] foreign
[57:31] if if you want to to rent a house but
[57:34] we're gonna Park some music how much do
[57:36] you need
[57:36] if you want to help somebody
[57:41] if you want to give to the Lord
[57:44] how much do I give how much is a
[57:48] question that we ask every day in our
[57:50] life
[57:52] yeah
[57:53] nothing the cost is a very important and
[57:57] integral part of our Lives

[58:57] understanding the course
[59:07] to raise the structures

[59:17] before you start you should know how
[59:20] much you have foreign
[59:33] [Music]
[59:58] tiger
[1:00:06] because if you don't count the course
[1:00:11] and I'm saying Brethren Even in our
[1:00:14] Christian Journey if you don't count the
[1:00:17] cause
[1:00:18] we shall be a laughing stock
[1:01:18] they make sacrifices
[1:01:22] all right I'll leave this I'll leave
[1:01:23] that I'll leave that Allah
[1:01:29] to follow Jesus that's why it is that
[1:01:33] song
[1:01:34] I've decided to follow Jesus
[1:01:39] that song doesn't sound like a man who
[1:01:42] doesn't know what is foreign
[1:02:22] foreign
[1:02:24] [Applause]
[1:02:45] we must count the cause thrilling up by
[1:02:47] normal triangle we must count the cross
[1:02:49] you know and Jesus said the man has to
[1:02:53] First
[1:02:54] counter and you know how much
[1:02:58] will it cost me
[1:03:00] praise the name of the Lord I see you
[1:03:03] have increased it so much but still I
[1:03:06] can't hear myself and I'm straining a
[1:03:07] lot so I don't know what exactly is
[1:03:10] wrong maybe the brother can help him to
[1:03:11] balance the sound now I'd like I would
[1:03:13] like you to look at verse 31.

[1:03:42] [Music]
[1:03:54] deep in our hearts
[1:03:56] Hallelujah man praise the name of the
[1:03:59] Lord
[1:04:02] King

[1:04:07] another king
[1:04:11] and doesn't first sit down
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:15] and count the cross
[1:04:17] [Music]
[1:04:20] is generous
[1:04:22] and inquires from them
[1:04:25] tell me
[1:04:27] how big is our but uh our soldiers how
[1:04:30] big is our army
[1:04:32] and you'll be told I have ten thousand
[1:04:36] white and then he will ask how big is
[1:04:39] the uh the uh our enemies
[1:04:46] to give the accountability
[1:04:53] yes now you're coming brother generously
[1:04:56] will tell him
[1:04:58] um
[1:05:09] and Jesus said yes
[1:05:20] according to the situation
[1:05:23] there is no way we our army of ten
[1:05:25] thousand
[1:05:27] foreign
[1:05:36] [Music]
[1:05:38] and Jesus concluded by saying yes then
[1:05:41] this King
[1:05:43] while this the other Army of the enemy
[1:05:45] is still far away
[1:05:48] he will devise another means
[1:05:51] [Music]
[1:05:53] he will send an ambassador
[1:05:58] to go to the other Army again
[1:06:01] and send a message
[1:06:04] saying our King
[1:06:09] to offer peace foreign
[1:06:30] [Music]
[1:06:51] if you were a king you don't win a
[1:06:54] battle by being emotions
[1:07:01] we have to go and kill all of them
[1:07:04] together
[1:07:08] you must know the Art of War property
[1:07:18] must not only know how strong his arm is
[1:07:25] also how strong is
[1:07:27] [Music]
[1:07:52] these are two examples
[1:07:56] yes we are too but did you know he gave
[1:08:00] an example of a builder yeah
[1:08:03] but he also is he
[1:08:07] Jesus God himself is a building
[1:08:10] forever the house the Bible says in
[1:08:12] Hebrews 3 4 for every house is building
[1:08:14] by some man but he that built but he
[1:08:17] that buildeth built all things is God
[1:08:26] Hallelujah
[1:08:29] praise the name of the Lord who built
[1:08:32] all things
[1:08:36] did some people miss it
[1:08:42] and God has a wise Builder Museum he
[1:08:46] counted the cross
[1:08:49] and he knew what his church
[1:08:53] he knew we needed grace through his
[1:08:55] blood
[1:08:58] he knew we were helpless
[1:09:01] he knew he had to come and help
[1:09:04] pay the cost
[1:09:06] of salvation
[1:09:10] Hallelujah man so all we as Believers
[1:09:13] need to do
[1:09:14] is to believe what he has done for us
[1:09:19] the second example he gave chocolate was
[1:09:23] a king's example
[1:09:25] and he said
[1:09:27] a king
[1:09:29] will know listen listen now this is a
[1:09:31] very good one we know how to attack
[1:09:36] he will Fast count the coast
[1:09:43] Our God knew the strength of his enemies
[1:09:50] you remember the example he gave
[1:09:53] the enemies
[1:09:58] but when God looked at his enemies
[1:10:02] he gauged his strength
[1:10:06] and he also knew where his strength
[1:10:10] and he knew he's much stronger
[1:10:14] he knew the devil is much weaker than
[1:10:16] him
[1:10:18] he knew that he he knew that his armies
[1:10:22] are greater than Lucifer's Army
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:27] so God did not send ambassadors of Peace
[1:10:38] Jesus yes did not come to bring peace
[1:10:47] what was that charity because when he
[1:10:51] came to fire yes
[1:10:55] he knew his enemies
[1:11:00] if he comes with a sword he must
[1:11:03] defeated
[1:11:06] Christ did not come to bring the gospel
[1:11:09] of peace with the Devil
[1:11:14] to destroy the very works of Saturn
[1:11:19] Hallelujah man and I want to say this
[1:11:21] also we therefore should not live at
[1:11:24] peace
[1:11:26] with the Devil
[1:11:30] no upana we should refuse to live at
[1:11:34] peace with the devil together
[1:11:36] if the devil brings you a demon a spirit
[1:11:39] of lust Satan we are created
[1:11:43] peace without Spirit
[1:11:46] fight against him how do you do that by
[1:11:50] coming to church
[1:11:55] by praying by coming for services by
[1:11:59] being on fire for God
[1:12:01] if the devil brings this kind of spirits
[1:12:11] demons
[1:12:12] believe us the problem with this
[1:12:16] they try to make peace with the Devil
[1:12:21] um
[1:12:22] do you know Ghana we should refuse
[1:12:25] foreign
[1:12:51] should count your course I don't know
[1:12:54] count your cost God counted this course
[1:13:12] if his armies were
[1:13:14] about his son his daughter's armies
[1:13:19] Hallelujah
[1:13:23] Hallelujah
[1:14:11] [Applause]
[1:14:23] foreign oh
[1:15:24] foreign
[1:15:30] we don't want even the thoughts of it
[1:15:36] yes until we get to that level
[1:15:40] refuse the spirits we cannot be
[1:15:43] delivered you have to refuse them you
[1:15:47] got to feel bad about them

[1:19:05] the female and male glands when they mix
[1:19:08] together

[1:20:52] of the voice of
[1:21:00] so what are you doing now
[1:21:07] you you you you are very busy
[1:21:10] Contracting this
[1:21:11] is
[1:21:36] you it is
[1:21:42] trying to destroy young people
[1:21:46] yes we are not going to accept them
[1:21:49] together

[1:22:00] We are following the right patterns
[1:22:03] that has been given to us
[1:22:06] we must count the costs
[1:22:09] we must count the costs
[1:22:11] praise the name of the Lord
[1:22:13] now I'll read for you one last quote
[1:22:18] the Investments
[1:22:21] it's a very good message
[1:22:25] and many times people who call
[1:22:28] themselves Believers
[1:22:30] and are unwilling to separate themselves
[1:22:47] yet after we could say it well I
[1:22:51] unidentified by uh identified by the
[1:22:53] scripture that the policies are still
[1:22:55] being given to whosoever wants to
[1:22:57] receive it
[1:23:00] foreign
[1:23:31] [Music]
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:23:58] [Applause]
[1:24:01] how can I get money
[1:24:04] you thought money just dropped from
[1:24:06] Heaven
[1:24:10] even those who got miracles of money
[1:24:13] they were true Disciples of Jesus
[1:24:18] yes and I'm preaching to you about the
[1:24:22] cost of disciples
[1:24:26] if you're not a true disciple I can't
[1:24:29] even get miracles of money
[1:24:33] Peter was one of them who got miracles
[1:24:39] he was following his master yeah
[1:24:53] fish when I was in a Guero Island
[1:24:56] fishing
[1:24:58] so now I can fish
[1:25:00] I'm very proud of that
[1:25:03] I I I I enjoy fishing
[1:25:06] but I learned a lot of it it has the
[1:25:10] spiritual connections
[1:25:14] there's a lot of patience involved
[1:25:18] mucho
[1:25:43] Hallelujah
[1:25:48] how much money do you think was there
[1:25:52] it was enough to take care of everything
[1:25:54] so God can give you miracles
[1:26:04] it doesn't happen
[1:26:06] to mediocrest
[1:26:10] all kinds of real disciples
[1:26:17] so what I'm trying to say
[1:26:19] you say that some people call themselves
[1:26:21] Believers
[1:26:24] themselves
[1:26:27] depart from the things of the world
[1:26:33] for you to be a true disciples
[1:26:38] when I was told you should do you sell
[1:26:40] everything
[1:26:43] remember you have touched the baddest
[1:26:45] parts
[1:26:55] [Music]
[1:26:56] you even know the part where you speak
[1:27:00] Jesus wants you to forsake it
[1:27:04] am I preaching to somebody tonight
[1:27:07] Jesus wants you to forsake it then then
[1:27:12] you will be the good disciple as I said
[1:27:16] he saw something in Jesus no man's heart
[1:27:21] you saw something in this message
[1:27:26] but to him the price was so great that
[1:27:29] he didn't want to pay any to pay the
[1:27:31] price
[1:27:38] if being a Believer
[1:27:41] it seems I should leave my girlfriend
[1:27:47] if being a Believer means
[1:27:54] this one is so hard for me
[1:27:57] if being a believer that means I should
[1:28:00] not even be flirting with girls on my
[1:28:01] phone
