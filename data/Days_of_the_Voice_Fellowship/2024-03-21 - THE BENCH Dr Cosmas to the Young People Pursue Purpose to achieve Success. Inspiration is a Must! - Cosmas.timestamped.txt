[0:00] so you find a lot of young people they
[0:01] are not willing to do what they they
[0:03] ought to do actually what they advised
[0:05] to do but they think that prayer is
[0:08] going to make it like magical that's
[0:10] that is what religious religion has done
[0:14] to people okay because that's not
[0:16] Christianity yeah Christianity also
[0:19] teach you
[0:21] that uh ecclesiastic n whatever you find
[0:25] yourself to do do it with all your might
[0:30] all your soul with all your ability and
[0:32] that's why our Prophet also taught us
[0:36] yes whatever you want to do be the best
[0:38] out of it yeah even if you make up your
[0:41] mind to be a criminal be the best
[0:43] criminal criminal not a mediocre don't
[0:46] come halfway on it that's that's the
[0:49] attitude so and if you want to be a
[0:52] Christian be a good kind of Christian
[0:55] don't be Halfway Christian you know
[0:57] become an incubator chicken Christian
[0:59] people must follow you up call you every
[1:01] time to come to church chur throw
[1:04] yourself into it
[1:07] yeah that's right when w Braham prayed
[1:10] about his sick situation and was asking
[1:14] God he said God if I die I will come to
[1:19] heaven and I will tell you I trusted you
[1:22] and I died M so what does that mean he
[1:25] believed God with all his heart with no
[1:29] reservation
[1:30] M
[1:32] so I had a attitude why I why I make
[1:36] this story is that so you can we can go
[1:39] back to the prophet word when John just
[1:42] speak he speak by inspiration yes that
[1:45] is our attitude that bring result
[1:48] exactly but many of us is that we are
[1:51] living in a generation of
[1:54] irresponsibility where people want to um
[2:00] nobody want to accept responsibility
[2:02] people just want to abortion blame
[2:05] transfer responsibility to other people
[2:08] you don't have good reason to explain
[2:11] why they didn't do anything believing
[2:13] that that reason is enough no reason
[2:17] actually people don't
[2:20] know the war the word poor MH it's not
[2:25] about people who lack mhm check your
[2:28] West po po means
[2:32] unproductive the word poor is not about
[2:35] people who lack things people that are
[2:37] refer to poor people and people who are
[2:40] not productive when you are not
[2:43] productive then the word poor is refer
[2:46] is is referred to you exactly so God
[2:50] created a man to be a manager mhm God
[2:54] created a man to work mhm if you read
[2:58] your Bible gen Genesis
[3:01] 1 after Genesis 1 to the end then
[3:04] Genesis 2 was the application of Genesis
[3:07] 1 Genesis 2:4 said the eight was filled
[3:11] with rock no Beauty nothing nothing is
[3:15] functional MH because why there was no
[3:19] human being mhm man was the motivation
[3:21] of beauty mhm until God created man then
[3:25] water came from the ground then Garden
[3:28] was developed so the first thing God did
[3:31] is he took a man he made Genesis 2:15
[3:33] and put him in the garden and said
[3:37] cultivate
[3:38] it dress it make it beautiful protect it
[3:43] m so man was made to walk this is before
[3:48] fall this is before the fall so walk is
[3:51] not a
[3:53] cause but many of us do not know the
[3:58] difference between work and a job
[4:02] because I believe they look like the
[4:04] same but they are not exactly the same
[4:06] yeah okay your
[4:09] job is what they pay you for what you
[4:14] do but your work is what you are born to
[4:18] do MH your job can never make you weldy
[4:23] MH it has limitation in making you
[4:26] wealthy what makes you wealthy is your
[4:29] work mhm you go to your job to learn
[4:34] your work mhm when you go to your job in
[4:37] the morning you come back in the evening
[4:39] and start practicing your job your your
[4:42] work M because
[4:46] job in job they pay you salary M salary
[4:52] is a medicine for
[4:54] poverty but it doesn't cure
[4:57] it so is there connection between work
[5:00] and
[5:01] purpose there is a work is actually
[5:04] purpose exactly work is actually purpose
[5:09] the reason actually you can call it
[5:11] devotion the reason why you were born if
[5:15] you find it that is
[5:18] purpose a natural
[5:21] word even
[5:23] establishment that are purposely driven
[5:27] are much more successful than the ones
[5:29] that profit driven MH if you pursue
[5:32] purpose mhm you will
[5:36] achieve success because when you fulfill
[5:39] purpose this is the reason why you are
[5:42] created and that's why people everybody
[5:44] must not be a doctor everybody must not
[5:46] be a lawyer every if God call you to to
[5:50] to sing just go there and sing like and
[5:55] actually you stop working when you find
[5:57] your purpose yeah
[6:00] when you operate in your purpose you
[6:03] don't do it with any stress yeah because
[6:07] it's like fish to water yeah just swis
[6:10] when fish is swimming he walking but his
[6:14] wing doesn't pain him when bir is flying
[6:18] he's walking but his wind also never
[6:22] pays him so when you find your purpose
[6:25] of existence you stop working you is
[6:29] something you love to do and by doing it
[6:33] the result will be so evident because
[6:36] you are in your purpose of life yeah it
[6:39] just comes natural it come natural so
[6:42] when
[6:44] I tried all of those things it was life
[6:48] was rough and hard tough
[6:52] difficult because this was before
[6:54] Nigeria Civil War which year are we
[6:56] talking about here we are talking about
[6:58] like 19 uh Nigeria civil war broke
[7:02] out uh I think
[7:05] 1960 either 62 or 63 I'm not very sure
[7:08] but Nigeria had this independent in 1960
[7:11] it wasn't long soon after that I think
[7:13] by 65 or the the the civil war broke out
[7:16] okay and I was still a young man you
[7:19] know little boy uh you know you it's
[7:23] something you don't wish for anybody to
[7:25] see where you see J fighter come
[7:27] dropping bomb in people house we ran
[7:30] under the bunker people could not go to
[7:33] farm to fish we have to it's about
[7:35] survival we ate every anything that is
[7:38] moving to be able to to leave but I have
[7:41] sheer
[7:43] determination that if there's one person
[7:45] that will be alive and survive so it's
[7:48] all about determination we made in
[7:51] ourself that's why when I teach
[7:53] principle I tell people the first thing
[7:55] you need to bring on the table with God
[7:57] is desire mhm you must have desire
[8:01] mhm because your desire is like your egg
[8:04] mhm the jam the seed come from God but
[8:08] that seed will not fall on
[8:11] anything if a woman make love with her
[8:15] husband if she doesn't drop egg she can
[8:18] make love as many time as possible no
[8:20] thing will germinate those egg will die
[8:22] so the egg has to be there for the seed
[8:25] to come into it and you see life is
[8:27] created so that desire will be there so
[8:31] and that's why Jesus in mark
[8:35] 11:24 say whatever you
[8:40] desire you believe you receive it and
[8:44] you will have it so desire it come
[8:49] first then the the promise come on it so
[8:53] you need to have that and that desire is
[8:56] what I call hunger and we have a we have
[8:59] an issue here uh I've seen it myself and
[9:02] many have actually even told to me
[9:03] directly when young people desire things
[9:07] let's say big things or they want to
[9:09] achieve certain things in life our
[9:11] society you know will just people will
[9:14] will talk words to you say well you're
[9:16] over ambitious you're overly ambitious
[9:18] you are proud you know instead of
[9:20] encouraging and many young people just
[9:22] then just stay back and you know and
[9:26] leave everything to fet okay so that is
[9:28] the
[9:29] um that is um very important uh point
[9:33] you have made there but I would like us
[9:35] to balance it and what do I mean by I
[9:39] want us to balance it the reality is
[9:41] that the way God want us to live even
[9:45] though we adult is to live like little
[9:50] children a little child do not know
[9:54] fear God want us to live a Fearless life
[10:01] we are not born with
[10:03] fear we learn fear fear is something we
[10:06] learn as we grow
[10:07] up if you find a
[10:10] child in his innocent
[10:15] level and I I actually tell
[10:18] parents today I teach people if you
[10:21] really want to
[10:22] know naturally who your child is wash
[10:25] him from the age of two to five if that
[10:31] child is a born
[10:33] Chef he will go to the sand and putting
[10:36] sand together to make like he's cooking
[10:38] if he's a
[10:40] born um doctor you see him taking
[10:44] something putting in Pap because what he
[10:47] is is manifesting naturally because
[10:50] that's what he was born to
[10:52] be by the time he's getting to the age
[10:55] of8 or nine his father is a lawyer
[10:59] father said go to school and learn law
[11:02] you can make money from law all these
[11:04] things doesn't make money then the boy
[11:07] the father decided to live his life
[11:10] through his own
[11:14] child the boy will go and learn law
[11:18] law but he will never win any case in
[11:20] the
[11:23] court because anytime they say something
[11:27] he's looking for book he never get
[11:30] inspiration nothing speak back to him
[11:31] the only
[11:33] book his father forc him to become a
[11:36] doctor because his father is a doctor
[11:38] because you're a doctor your son must be
[11:39] a doctor it doesn't work like that yeah
[11:42] you fish can never climb a tree
[11:46] yeah are you feel what I'm saying yes so
[11:49] allow the children to grow naturally
[11:52] parents many time are dream Killers we
[11:56] parents kill the dreams of our children
[11:59] but the truth also is that if you many
[12:02] time it's a diff a it's really a
[12:06] difficult thing to explain but I told
[12:10] people problem many times is opportunity
[12:12] in life MH because the word crisis in
[12:16] Chinese language actually means
[12:18] opportunity M when you talk about crisis
[12:22] in
[12:23] China not
[12:25] like in the direct interpretation ofr
[12:29] in China is opportunity okay you can
[12:32] goog you can Google it so anything you
[12:37] think is an obstacle m is an opportunity
[12:42] MH if my father is
[12:46] alive I did not believe my father could
[12:50] have allowed me to do some of the things
[12:52] I did mhm at my teenage that brought me
[12:57] to where I am mm
[13:00] so my father's de supposed to be a
[13:04] hindrance but I turned it into
[13:07] opportunity I knew there are things my
[13:09] children wanted to do that I stopped
[13:12] them my last boy wanted to drive motor
[13:15] bike I said please stop that you break
[13:18] your leg you cannot do that what stop
[13:21] stop but I drove motorbike at the age of
[13:24] 11 I was not 12 when I drove motorbike
[13:28] yeah my only son who drive motorbike out
[13:32] of my four boy is the one who disobeyed
[13:35] [Laughter]
[13:39] me are you get are you get what I'm yes
[13:42] but today both of us go out to go and
[13:46] ride bike and you enjoy together yeah we
[13:50] we I'm a biker I have BMW 1,600 so he
[13:53] has Suzuki uh 1,300 we go out now and
[13:57] rad back and we are the only two people
[13:59] road bike in my family but he's able to
[14:03] ride back by disobedient many time you
[14:07] will never find Road without missing
[14:09] road yeah that's
[14:11] right if you keep on following a road
[14:14] that has been taught to you you will not
[14:16] discover new road that's right so you
[14:20] need sometime you need to miss road
[14:23] yeah you may get to the end and you find
[14:26] out there's no Road there you come back
[14:28] it's a experience yeah you've gained
[14:31] experience and people ask me why do you
[14:32] say this thing don't you know this thing
[14:34] will confuse young people I said life is
[14:36] not about what all that you are taught
[14:40] you must have inspiration
[14:43] M if my father was alive he will never
[14:47] allow me to marry under 20 years H
[14:51] because it's it's not in our tradition
[14:53] so I break tradition for you to do
[14:57] something new you break tradition
[15:01] mhm William
[15:03] Braham did not force himself to see he
[15:06] was born a SE
[15:08] MH and his brethren in Baptist Church
[15:12] said this is
[15:13] devil you can what do you say you see
[15:17] because we don't see here what do you
[15:19] say you are seeing we don't believe any
[15:20] such thing you don't believe such thing
[15:22] stop
[15:23] it and he kned down start praying God I
[15:25] don't want evil spirit please take this
[15:27] away from me but the gift and calling of
[15:30] God is without repentance so he couldn't
[15:32] do anything about it so if you are too
[15:36] guided micromanaging people you don't
[15:39] get to see the people fully actualize
[15:42] themselves so sometime we must also
[15:44] allow our young people to make their
[15:46] mistakes because that's part of learning
