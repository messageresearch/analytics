[1:38:54] Luke chapter
[1:38:56] 9 verse
[1:39:02] [Music]
[1:39:03] 57-62 verse 57- 62 the Bible says and it
[1:39:08] came to pass that as they went in the
[1:39:10] way a certain man said unto him Lord I
[1:39:14] will follow thee with soever thou
[1:39:19] goest and Jesus said unto him Foles have
[1:39:24] holes and the bodies of the air have
[1:39:28] nests but the son of man has not where
[1:39:31] to lay his
[1:39:33] head and he said unto another follow me
[1:39:38] but he said Lord suffer me first to go
[1:39:42] and bury my father Jesus said unto him
[1:39:46] let the dead bu their dead but go thou
[1:39:50] and preach the kingdom of God and
[1:39:53] another also said Lord I will follow
[1:39:57] thee but let me first go be them
[1:40:01] fairwell which are at home at my
[1:40:05] house Jesus said unto him no man having
[1:40:10] put his hand to the plow and looking
[1:40:13] back is fit for the kingdom of God
[1:40:22] look fore
[1:41:20] amen may God add the blessing to the of
[1:41:26] his amen pleas take your
[1:41:31] seats out of the
[1:41:34] scriptures brother told us it gives us
[1:41:39] great
[1:41:41] consolation that one word from
[1:41:45] God when we share it among our
[1:41:48] soul it brings his presence
[1:41:53] by the reading of the
[1:41:55] scripture the presence of God comes
[1:41:59] down we have read
[1:42:02] here three kinds of
[1:42:05] people the first one comes and makes a
[1:42:09] confession to the
[1:42:12] Lord the Lord did not call
[1:42:16] him
[1:42:17] no it just came to
[1:42:20] pass it just came to pass
[1:42:24] and the man came to the Lord and said I
[1:42:27] will follow
[1:42:29] thee wherever you go I would follow
[1:42:33] you and Jesus had the
[1:42:38] statement he
[1:42:42] said the foxes have
[1:42:45] hores the birds of the have
[1:42:48] Nest but the son of man has not where to
[1:42:52] lay his
[1:42:54] are you ready to bear
[1:42:57] that you think you going to follow me
[1:43:00] and get where to lay your
[1:43:02] head and get all just good
[1:43:06] time he says even the FES are better
[1:43:09] than
[1:43:11] me he knew what was in the heart of that
[1:43:15] man and Jesus didn't say all right let
[1:43:18] us
[1:43:20] go he just went to another one
[1:43:23] and told
[1:43:25] another follow
[1:43:27] me but this one has made a
[1:43:30] confession this one has asked
[1:43:33] it why turn it to
[1:43:37] another and follow
[1:43:42] me you have not chosen
[1:43:45] me I have chosen
[1:43:55] but he said
[1:43:57] Lord suffer me first to go and bury my
[1:44:01] father I want you to look at
[1:44:04] this this fellow has got excuses
[1:44:09] moreover and the Lord is calling him the
[1:44:13] other one had no
[1:44:15] excuses this one has
[1:44:18] excuses me I go first bu my
[1:44:21] father the Lord in on
[1:44:26] him let the dead bu their
[1:44:30] dead go thou and preach the kingdom of
[1:44:34] God why do you insist on this
[1:44:38] one that is giving
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:44:45] excuses his ways are not your
[1:44:49] ways his wisdom is past finding out
[1:44:56] then the third
[1:44:57] one said unto him Lord I will follow
[1:45:03] you
[1:45:05] but let me first
[1:45:08] go and be them
[1:45:12] farewell which are at
[1:45:14] home at my
[1:45:20] house this is another kind of believer
[1:45:22] here
[1:45:24] Jesus said unto
[1:45:26] him no
[1:45:28] man having put his hand to the
[1:45:32] pl and looking
[1:45:35] back is fit for the
[1:45:46] kingdom in Exodus chter
[1:45:51] 14 verse 15
[1:45:54] let me read this chapter this
[1:45:57] verse the Bible
[1:46:00] says and the Lord said unto
[1:46:03] Moses wherefore CEST thou unto
[1:46:08] me why are you crying unto me but is not
[1:46:12] recorded that Moses
[1:46:14] cried God looked in the heart of
[1:46:17] Moses said Moses why are you crying unto
[1:46:21] me speak to the children of
[1:46:24] Israel that they go
[1:46:27] forward no man having put his hand to
[1:46:30] the
[1:46:31] plow and looking back is fit for the
[1:46:35] kingdom of
[1:46:36] God mes speak unto the children of
[1:46:40] Israel that they go forward don't just
[1:46:43] cry here go
[1:46:46] forward my subject is press

[2:01:22] was K against
[2:01:24] Israel and he made them Wonder in the
[2:01:27] wilderness 40 years until all the
[2:01:31] generation that done evil in the sight

[2:03:16] cross
[2:03:23] brothers and
[2:03:24] sister you find that Joshua
[2:03:28] 22 that's not what God had purposed
[2:03:32] for God had purposed them to go into
[2:03:36] can the land is Flowing
[2:03:39] with but they saw somewhere that it was

[3:36:10] my hand over my
[3:36:12] mouth there it came again
[3:36:17] and said just keep
[3:36:24] pressing if you only
[3:36:27] knew what was at the end of
[3:36:31] the why we
[3:36:34] stop it's because we don't know what is
[3:36:36] at the end of
[3:36:39] the but we walk by
[3:36:41] faith and not by sight
[3:36:45] seen them are far
[3:36:48] off they were persed of
[3:36:53] them and it seemed like I could hear gr
[3:36:57] snailing or somebody that sang that song
[3:37:01] like
[3:37:03] this he heard
[3:37:05] this like a song like this they sing it
[3:37:09] here and all of you all I am homesick

[3:37:52] path and would vanish all
[3:37:55] fears Lord let me look past
[3:38:01] the you have heard it at the
[3:38:05] church and I heard something
[3:38:08] say would you like to just see beyond
[3:38:11] the C
[3:38:15] I said it would help me so
[3:38:18] much
[3:38:21] sometimes I have heard it in my
[3:38:24] life you always have it
[3:38:27] too sometimes you are seeking
[3:38:32] something about
[3:38:34] it about it dying for it calling on the
[3:38:38] name of the
[3:38:39] Lord and God
[3:38:41] sees that somehow you are may be wearing
[3:38:47] and he gives you a dream
[3:38:52] about it shows you a dream that you are
[3:38:55] going to get
[3:38:56] it it shows it in a
[3:38:59] dream when you having it and it gives
[3:39:02] you
[3:39:04] courage sometimes in a
[3:39:07] vision sometimes through the
[3:39:10] preaching why he says it helps you so
[3:39:14] much
[3:39:20] it would help me so
[3:39:22] much God you show me give me a taste of
[3:39:27] this and I looked in just a
[3:39:30] moment one breath I had come into a
[3:39:33] little
[3:39:34] place that
[3:39:36] slanted I looked back I was laying
[3:39:40] laying on the bed I said this is strange

[3:40:01] ping he said we should not beat
[3:40:06] this but we are part of his
[3:40:09] FL so we can't repeat
[3:40:13] it whether it was us I was in this body
[3:40:16] or
[3:40:19] out whether it was a
[3:40:22] translation it wasn't like any Vision I
[3:40:24] ever
[3:40:27] had it could look there and I could look
[3:40:31] here I could look there and look
[3:40:35] here and when I hit that little
[3:40:39] place I never seen so many people coming
[3:40:42] running screaming
[3:40:46] our precious
[3:40:47] brother our precious brother and I'll
[3:40:51] jump some of the things he says and I
[3:40:53] stopped and I
[3:40:55] looked and I was young I looked back at
[3:40:58] my old body laying
[3:41:00] there my behind my
[3:41:03] head said I don't understand this young
[3:41:07] women and young
