name of the Lord I willome you this evening in the Presa of the Lord and shall we turn to our Bible amen I turn with me the Book of Matthew chapter 11 uh we shall let's let us uh begin from um all right we can begin from the very first verse and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of uh commanding his 12 his 12 disciples that he then to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had in the prison The Works of Christ Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him at thou he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which you do hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk and the lepers cleansed and the de here and the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and as they departed Jesus began saying the uh saying to the multitude concerning John what went ye into the wildness to see a read shaken with the wind but what went he out for to see a man clothed with soft uh reignment behold they they that wear soft clothing are in King's house uh in King's houses but what went ye for to see a prophet yeah I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face who shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you amongst them that are born of women there hath not risen are greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he that is that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he then 12 says and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffer violence and the violent take it by force Lord Jesus we thank you for the reading of the word Lord I just yield myself this evening to be used by your Holy Spirit May the Holy Spirit come down and take this word and break it to us precious father release your inspiration tonight that Lord by the end of this sharing will be encouraged restored and revived father we thank you we come against every evil spirit which is against this word every powers of darkness in the name of Jesus Satan you cannot withstand the word of God we render you powerless for the bible say that God has magnified his word even above his name precious father we thank you because Lord It's a honor to have in our midst tonight in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen yeah you may take your seat I want to thank the Lord for the opportunity he has given me to stand before the redeemed amen yeah just pray for me that the Lord will use me to speak to you blessed be the name of the Lord amen uh this evening I'm going to take to take my text from vers 12 where he says that from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of God or the Kingdom of Heaven serth violence and the violent take it by force amen and I will call it the violent take it by force blessed be the name of the Lord amen praise be to God the violent take it by force we shall see other scriptures as well blessed be the name of the Lord we have come tonight for an overnight night prayer and we have come to wrestle with the Enemy blessed be the name of the Lord I believe each one of us the enemy has been speaking to us say but now you feel you are tired why do you need to go there you mean if you pray just hear W God hear your prayer but because of that violent say no I must be there amen and I'm here to tell you and to remind you that from the time of John the Baptist as Jesus said the kingdom of God suffer violent and is the violent and the violent take it by force blessed be the name of the Lord amen in 2 Corinthians chapter 10: 3 it says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for we for the weapon of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of stronghold blessed be the name of the Lord we are pulling down this stronghold in prayer praise to God Amen so we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh that's why we don't fight our enem we don't box our enemies because if it was caral Battle all of us would be students of kungu or Tao for our selfdefense and other things blessed BL be the name of the Lord but we are fighting spiritual warfare amen and we are fighting this battle on our knees praise be to God even when we are oppressed sometime when you're annoyed by people our Prophet says that when our when your brother wronged you what would you go before the Lord you pray for your brother amen or you go with him before the Lord not to asuse him but you go and pray for your brother forgive your brother amen sometime you sayh but I he did this intentionally whether it is intentional or not pray for your brother pray for your sister and forgive him forgive are blessed be the name of the Lord because for our weapon amen our weapon the weapon of our fa is not caral but is mighty through God it become Mighty only through God Amen that is the weapon of Our Fair it's mighty through God to the pulling down of of strongholds casting down imaginations in every High thing that exalt itself itself against the knowledge of God and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ blessed be the name of the Lord I sing the weapon of our fair that is the impact of the weapon of Our Fair blessed be the name of the Lord and tonight I'm here to tell you that it is the violence it's the violence that take the kingdom by force blessed be the name of the Lord that we whatever we want from God God has given us promises in his word he has given us blessings in this word amen he has given us a lot of things in his word praise be to God but we must take a step to acquire these things these things we are not going to receive them be it marriage marriage will not come on a silver plate praise be to God you must take a step amen you must pray sometime you have to pray and fast because you may not know why things are going that direction but when you go in prayer and fasting to find the mind of God about your life amen that's when God will reveal to you he will guide you which way to go blessed be the name of the Lord amen sometime we think that uhuh it will just happen automatically no sir praise be to God so you must take a step because it is the violin that take it by force amen praise be to God uh as I was praying here this evening this thought came to me and I believe because I was wondering I said God what what are we going to share always I always tell it's my hardest time each time they tell me that brother you are standing today it becomes a Tagle for but as I was praying and waiting on God this scripture came to me blessed be the name of the Lord and when I went in uh reading it and also reading some quotes uh my heart was contented that God wanted me to speak about this and if you just give me your undivided attention I believe the Lord will speak to you blessed be the name of the Lord because we are living in the time we are living in perilous time we are living in challenging moments blessed be the name of the Lord amen if you read the message if you read uh the Bible you realize that the time we are living in and only what is going to keep us moving is to keep ourself closed in the word is to keep ourself on our knees blessed be the name of the Lord because we realize that even Christian we are losing our ground if we are not careful one time we shared here about be about uh being drifted without knowing praise be to God this thing comes little by little and by the time you realize you are behaving in a contradicting way but before you realize a Believer is abusing someone before you realize you have hot temper amen before you realize when time for sleeping come you just enter in your bed you come back when you are tired and you forget about family altar blessed be the name of the Lord but I'm here to remind my brothers and my sister that the kingdom of God is taken by force right way back from the patriarch amen there is nobody who received God's blessing on Silver Plate they had to fight for it they had to wrestle to get it amen it is through God promised look at the promised land when God brought them out of the bondage and he led them the promised land still they had to fight for that land blessed be the name of the Lord even when they were in Egypt there are those few who knew the promise of God and according to the message of the hour the prophet tells us that Moses's father every evening would go up in the upper chamber to pray because he knew the promise that God had given them the promise that one day he would bring them out of Egypt blessed be the name of the Lord amen and every time he used every evening and maybe every morning he would pray God remember your word god remember your promise God you say you spoke to our father amen that after this period you would bring us out blessed be the name of the Lord so I'm here to tell you that is the violent that take it by force some think that they are going to receive the Holy Spirit just on Silver Plate it is true God gave out the Holy Ghost but you must do something there is some little sacrifice you must do praise be to God you must live under expectation every time sometime we come to church just overnight overnight you come and sit you go back the same you come and little suay today is Sunday let us go you come sit you go back this today is Easter today is the Lord's Supper there is something Beyond just enjoying the Lord's Supper praise be to God we are Covenant people we have the promise of God for us amen and another thing we are in the battle blessed be the name of the Lord each time we come here praise the Lord every time you come in a service like this you have come to make your enemy you have come to chase your enemy you've come to command it off your territory praise be to God and you must take a stand of Faith because the Bible says whoever comes God Must Believe first and I believe I'm speaking to Believers tonight that God is that he is here amen because he say that there sever two or three gathers in his name he will come and be in our midst after knowing that God is in our midst then you come believing knowing that he's going to reward your sacrifice he's going to reward your effort blessed be the name of the Lord that encourages us to know that God is in our midst and God being in our midst is not enough you must provoke that God by your faith praise be to God he no longer want to be Emmanuel God With Us but now God want to be in us God will be much more effective when is in us than with us God was with Judah do you know that God walked with Judas he went with Judas they cast out demons with Judas but God was not in Judah blessed be the name of the Lord and what maketh difference is God being in us because when God is in us then we are sealed in the kingdom of God that's when we say that we are marked we are sealed and that's when we are not shaken that's when we can stand and say the anchor hold blessed be the name of the Lord Christ want to be in us because he knows that we cannot fight this battle alone praise be to God the reason asked why many are quitting it is because they have been walking with Jesus but Jesus want to be in US praise be to God someone believes the message for 30 40 years then he wakes up in the morning and say ah I didn't know that message then you wonder you've been preaching it for the last 40 years in fact if I reach that part say just God just take me home you become a bigger stumbling block praise be to God where is the problem it is because they have been walking with Christ but Christ want to be in US amen that's why Jesus told the disciple go t ye in the Jerusalem T in the upper room and till the day of Pentecost praise be to God Amen and for the 10 days these men were not eating chicken and chips no sir they are not on the football Beach because remember when they Walking With Jesus they looked at them as hopeless people as crazy as people who had nothing to do they were unlearned to begin with they were ignorant men praise be to God so there are people whom the world was not even worthy they are not even worthy and Jesus who was giving this man's Vibe he was taken away from them praise be to God and I believe even them what shall we do now after all the man who gave us hope is also taken he's killed blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord but because these people they had the seed of God in them there was something telling them amen there was a beace within their heart telling them that this man he was not an ordinary man amen maybe they reminded Peter and asked and told him do you remember when he said that blood and flesh did not reveal that to you but my father who is in heaven praise me to God that is something somebody has ever been with Jesus is much much different with someone who has never tested Jesus praise the Lord his conversation will be different his action will be different amen the way he talks the way he walks the way he approaches matters will be different why because he has been with Jesus who was the great counselor blessed be the name of the Lord amen but this man somehow something pushed them and told but remember he said they were maybe pray in fact the Bible say they were praying amen they were waiting on God hallelujah they were waiting for the promise they knew that the violent shall take it's the violent who take it by force even Mary never say that for me I'm the mother of Jesus I produce you oh not with the Mary the mother of Jesus blessed be the name of the Lord maybe Mary had that you know the devil always come with such thought maybe sometimes mayy would see that Jesus was going overboard maybe the devil would whisper to her but you don't need to you don't need to fast so to restle so much after all you are the one who carried the baby in your womb if at all is the Lord is the savior yes he will he will redeem you anyhow not with Mary blessed be the name of the Lord amen she had to struggle to go and wait in the upper room and from that time until today remember that we are the ACT we are the uh the book of the continuation of the book of Acts the same same way the same same approach we must follow the same approach during the time of Daniel they had the promise of their Liberation blessed be the name of the Lord and Daniel tells us that by the number of books he knew that 70 years was close and what did he do he went to seek God In Prayer fasting supp ation confession amen why because he knew that the promise which God gave them was about to come to pass I'm here to remind you my brothers that we must do something about this message we must do something about the promise of God In Our Last Days amen we must prepare ourself blessed be the name of the Lord the moment the engagement has been announced preparation begins brother Alan is that true amen Jesus the groom and the church the bride Jesus already started a preparation he said I'm going to the father I'm going to prepare for you a place amen way back when Jesus was on the cross when he was pierced on the side where we came out preparation started and from that time until today the preparation is going on Amen Jesus is ready to receive you and me are you ready to go are you prepared to go blessed be the name of the Lord preparing for us a place you must do something blessed be the name of the Lord because the Bible tells us there are those guys who never kept their places and they were cursed in outer Darkness you think they will just leave you to go those Fallen Angels who were once there who enjoyed what is there amen who enjoyed the presence of God who enjoyed that light there and because they never kept their places the bible say that they were cast in outer Darkness they in Chains and they will not allow you to just go because they know what is there and for them already they know what is there but for us by faith amen we know that what eyes have not seen what ears have not heard amen what even has not been perceived in human mind that is what God is preparing for us there and we are going there by faith praise be to God you must go there by faith and it must be violent faith it must be rugged faith not your faith but the faith of God where the Bible says impossible for God to lie amen and we get that same scripture amen when we pray for something today and we don't re and maybe you have not received it we don't stop there I pray in the morning I've not gotten it I will go in the afternoon and I will knock at God's store I pray in the afternoon and I not go any it I will go the following day that's what God want from us that is the violent Faith amen Jesus gave us an example of that unjust judge and the Widow had her case she went there the first day the judge never even gave attention I believe they are living in the time like the time we are living in today where the judges are corrupt where the whole system is corrupt she cannot even afford lawyers praise be to God she could not afford lawyers my brothers my sisters but she feared God Amen and she knew that God would move in the heart of this judge she went there in the morning and she was not attended to she went there the following day and she was not attending to she went she never gave up amen she never gave up my brothers because the violent they will take it by force until the judge said why in fact this man knew very well himself he but let me let me judge let me handle her case and Jesus that's what God expect us to do he has a lot for us but we must do something because the Bible tells us our anniversary the devil is moving like a hungry lion looking for somebody whom he may devour who he may finish but sometime you wonder a Christian we just live anyhow we talk anyhow you even sleep without prayer but the devil is on job when hell deploys his forces they don't Slumber they must be active 24/7 but Believers many times we just say prayers but the Bible never told us to say prayers amen it tells us to pray without ceasing amen we pray every time we pray every minute we pray every hour we pray in the night in the morning in the evening amen when things are good when things are bad when things are fair when it is raining when it is shining he told us to pray without season amen whether I have money I will pray whether I've eaten I will or not I will pray amen whether I have transport or not I will pray because it is the violent that take it by force the weapon of our Warfare is not caral amen but they are spiritual we are fighting against principalities we are fighting against dominions amen we are fighting against Spirits we are fighting against habits blessed be the name of the Lord amen he say that casting down every imagination and every High thing that exal s against the knowledge of God there is no imagination there is no I thing that can exal himself against God against you against our progress against our Sexes against our families against our children he tells us we are pulling down all those imaginations they are just imaginations blessed be the name of the Lord amen bringing them into captivity every thought The Obedience of Christ every thought praise be to God and having in Readiness to aveng to Revenge all Disobedience when your disobedience is fulf when your obedience is fulfilled do you look on things after the outward appearance If any man trust to himself that he is Christ let him blessed be the name of the to God against the principalities against the powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world they are rulers of Darkness of this world which doctors Sorcerers murderers thieves praise be to God those men they are possessed by evil spirits that's why they be wishing people that's why just because of your phone someone want to murder you it is because they yielded thems to be used by evil spirits praise be to God I remember when uh when speckled shifted to Z that place where the church is thieves used to hammer people there but as we are speaking today praise be to God that little light has covered almost the entire area and even there is development and I believe it's because of the presence of God in that place praise be to God we used to pray and just behind the church there were me Muslims who used to smoke pipes there they could even [Music] speak but as I'm speaking today the church has even bow that very place it is them who did what who left praise be to God they could the demons using them could not withstand the presence of God in that place praise be to God and because of the violent faith of men and women who stood and prayed every night every morning every evening every Wednesday something happened and today they are expanding and expanding blessed be the name of the Lord that same God is the God we are serving the same word is present in our midst and the same word is putting on flesh again because Jesus said as was in his first coming shall it be in his second coming this word in his first coming this word put on flesh this word went and visited Abraham blessed be the name of the Lord and gave Abram the promise the same word as put on flesh in our generation in Malachi 4 blessed be the name of the Lord and the same word is putting on flesh even tonight praise be to God Amen let us not leave the devil at peace we have not reach that point where we disorganize the devil until he's even knocked by his fellow demons but we have to reach that level where we disorganize the area where we are no demon will operate amen because the Shak glory is in that area because there is a believer who knows his God and is standing in that area I remember at home when we used to pray the witch doctors would not play their drums anymore and I think like so when they start then we sing there is power power Wonder King Power before even you sing two choruses there is silence in the whole sub count this whole area demons cannot operate where our True Believers are blessed be the name of the Lord and as I'm speaking today all those tring they are no longer there I remember brother Moses start at school in a place where they speak B and say that there is no one again who can stand here that place called cab go is alongside Miana Road brother were there amen for over two years nothing happened we gave those demons hard times the presence of demons were you could even hear them you enter in the house and you you hear quer kind of voices and even you know you can tell the presence of the Demons also where demons are you can tell it's when you're fully charged with the Holy Ghost and you get someone who's possessed you find someone reacting fin way even taking sometime you could just reach that comp and you feel like you're back something has just C your back and but Brethren by the grace of God we stood I will never forget one morning because you would pray every 3 a.m. in the morning would wake up to pray and that morning I was just there I'd already woken up but I was still lying on the bed facing up and when I was there I Heard a quered Voice and like some they had released some big over I don't know whether it was Throne or what when that thing came toward me the presence of God grabbed it and HED it on the wall and there was a great Echo this is not dream I'm talking about reality I was not dreaming Brothers how you were no I was not dreaming that day and my brother here was not waking up and when I woke I say I was being strangled by some forces so let us give the devil hard time everywhere the devil ever goes let us go and bang him in his head you hit him praise be to God let us may God give us that violent Faith may God give us the determination where a Believer will say I'm not going to be caral I'm going to be spiritual beginning from today I'm no longer going to be called in church I'll be saying amen I will be jumping when they are praising I will be singing when others are singing I'll be clapping when others are clapping amen that is what we want because it's the violent who are going to take it by force you will not take the kingdom of God by doing on that chair you will not take the kingdom of God by being silent amen because even in heaven there's no silence the silence was there only when the seals were open amena when the seals were open and the names were read blessed be the name of the Lord There Will shout amen that is what we want in our ministry may God give us that praise be to God Amen where even little children children will know that is time for Duty our Sunday school sisters don't allow the devil to come and lay his eggs on his your head because you are dozing you enjoying you become comfortable and the guy comes and drop his eggs on your head never allow that Dev to Hash on your head praise be to God when you see others clapping please clap your hands when you see others running the praise please run around when you see them singing sing with them even when you don't know how to sing please just sing anyhow even when you don't know the song just sing anyhow blessed be the name of the Lord amen the Bible tells us in Matthew 12: 22 then there was uh they brought unto him one possessed with with devil blind and dump and he healed him in so much that the Blind and the dump both spoke and saw blessed be the name of the Lord if you look at this guy's case b if you take him to C International clinic or hospital I don't know how much money would pay for a bill this man is dump let us read it again he was possessed with a devil he was blind and he was dump Amen in so much that the Blind and the dump both spoke and saw today they will check your ears you can see the specialist in ears and throat and many noise what and they start you know this condition came because of this and this maybe when you were young when you were when you were being born maybe you swallowed that water and because because of that you know the brain works like this not with Jesus amen Jesus does not explain before you reach there with Jesus you need no scan you need no x-ray blessed be the name of the Lord he knows all the way our body works and when you go before the presence of Jesus before you reach there every nve will look for it portion where it's supposed to be connected that's why when Jesus when this blind man and dum was brought to Jesus he was healed blessed be the name of the Lord amen he knows how our mental faculty work the brother Ivan was telling us he was trying to tell us something about human body that is designed in the way that even the professors cannot tell they only know like a quarter of how our body works but when it comes to God the great engineer the master of Masters the professor of the professor the counselor of the counselor the Healer of the Healer amen the deliverer of the deliverer The God Who can take the whole nation with just a stick in the hand of a man blessed be the name of the Lord that is the God we are serving and he telling us the Violet will take it by force amen when you are not willing to move don't stand on my way when I'm not willing to go I will not stand on your way come with your speed I will tell you brother just go praise be to God but if you're standing on somebody's way because of UN believe they will tro on you there's a man when there was when when there was Fame in the land of Israel and God spoke to Elijah and he told that more in such a such a Time amen there will be food and this man doubted blessed be the name of the Lord and the prophet of the Lord spoke to him and told him you will just stop by [Music] seeing and it did the following day when God made a way the man saw if you're unbelieving the word and you are seated here every day the word is not working on you you are not serious with God you don't want to seek the Holy Ghost one of these days hallelujah you will just see others where they are going if God can make it that way we borderline Believers we don't want to cross you feel like Crossing but when you think of your girlfriend you go back you feel like Crossing by think of you you go back I wish God could make it and you see others when they are going you'll remember to cry like elishah that my father my father of and the men that but the promise was for the for Elijah not for you and that's when you realize that I wish I was serious blessed be the name of the Lord so now is the time to arise and Shake Yourself let us pinch our conscience let us rebuild our altars that's why God sent Malachi 4 to restore us back to true worship you know where you are going you know where you came from you came from Catholic some from Catholic from Muslim to Catholic from Catholic to Adventist from Adventist to Pentecostal then you went back again to Muslim to Adventist you came to the message but still you don't want to move forward brother better move forward you are so reluctant the exent that you feel like you're are missing the Adventist choir do you know that the early believers used not even to sing to sing with this it was bubbling in them already amen praise be to God some have even started admiring the GC of Egypt they even admired the graves can you imagine I think because Egyptian were specialist specialist in building or in making Graves and they say that when they they die in the wilderness they'll just maybe gather Stone and break maybe a branch of tree and make a cross and then put it there and when they remember the Tas graves in Egypt they told Moses there were no graves in Egypt eypt blessed be the name of the Lord but God always look at that man with a different spirit and that's why even in Psalm said David was after his own heart that's why even when David sinned in Psalms 51 David he knew that by faith this God will receive me and we today we are even singing his prayer when the Spy went to Egypt sorry when they went to spy the land blessed be the name of the Lord the truth is even Joshua saw the Giants because Joshua was just human being like any of us here do you think they the the 10 that they had cross eyes no they had normal eyes even this one saw the giant but the difference was they had the promise blessed be the name of the Lord and they knew that if they are to take that land they're going to take it by force and that force would be coming from God not from their military training amen this man John the Baptist look at the way he preached he was filled with the Holy Ghost when he was still in the womb what do you expect to come from come out of him already was flaming sword praise be to God this man preached say until one day praise be to God but because John knew the king of God they take it by force and I believe maybe the man came even with a bodyguard because already was a Renown person and guess what before even before sitting he said but it's not lawful for you to take your brother's wife and I was like what you mean this what you guys have been listening praise be to God the violent they'll take it by force praise be to God if you turn over to Zechariah Chapter 3 vers three amen praise be to God not to say just want to to read like one chap one verse or two mhm amen amen Jesus quam say that rise ye that sleep and Shake Yourself and call on God isn't it written that the Lan Church age will be looking one they'll be spewed from the mouth of the Savior that is the message El sh die Shake Yourself rise up and give the dust of you blessed be the name of the Lord he said give a church that is so completely Anointed with god Till there every action and move is thus says the Lord walk in that sh of Glory believe the Lord Jesus Christ for your house apply the token to thy house then what do you do when you apply it to your house move all that trash out pray be to God in the message this message uh thou knowest it all things it says that if Satan tries to hand you some uh to hand you some of this stuff like sickness you know what you do just through just show him the toen he comes buzzing with his headache show him the token he comes he feel show him the token that's why we must have the token what will you show the devil so this is the time where you have to take it by faith I have been seeking for the Holy Spirit I've been seeking for being refilled I've been seeking for this and that I must receive it let us be persistent let us persist if I've not got a joy today I know God you are my joy if you have not prayed and you feel like youve not Pray Again amen because that's how you're going to take it even the Pentecostals they have lost their ground the Zeal they used to have is no longer there when the pocket drained the anointing also drained praise be to God but now is the time where we are s say God This Little Light of ours we are going to let it shine praise be to God as long as there is a little light amen the darkness cannot comprehend that light he say that in expectation that prayer is the most vital force that God ever put in the hand of mankind the most effective force that known to man is prayer pray is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the Contour of human beings do you know that prayer can overthrow the kingdom prayer can overthrow even the government prayer can turn the world upside down amen when a fervent prayer is made even cancer will get confused when Believers are serious in prayer sickness will just have to flee and the prophet is making it very clear that is the most powerful weapon that was ever put in the cont of human being there's no atomic bomb no hydrogen bomb no powerful as prayer prayer will change the mind of God he said that tell me one Christian that doesn't have Temptation Temptation we never came to a picnic we have come to a Battleground we are out here to fight every enemy amen we are here to fight every stubborn Spirit we are here to fight every wickedness we are here to fight every Rebellion every rebellious spirit every condition every situation that is why we are here we are the soldiers of the Cross we are in the Lord's army to fight these demons and there's no way they're going to put us down just allow Christ to be in you and let God fight his battles butam told us that this battle began in heaven we have nothing to do with this battle my brothers amen and because the battle began there that's why he came down and he is incarnated in men and women and he's using them to overcome sin praise be to God even when you are beaten down I don't care how many time you've been beaten down by sin but brother sister just have this that the violent they will take it by force when the devil give you upper cut you give him uppercut amen when he puts you down you put him down when he pulls you you pull him amen that's what Jacob did he had to take it by force and here it is physical Force even praise be to God we want to see brothers and sister who will come here limping amen and as brother no I rested with the angel the whole night the same Angel still visiting the land the same Angel still moving tonight that same Angel who rested with Jacob is still moving in the Church of the Living God and there are still men and women who are wrestling with the angel even as I'm speaking now there are those who are wrestling with him praise be to God but come limping because you had an encounter with the Holy Ghost blessed be the name of the Lord amen he say if you become a Christian just to be looked at then yeah why I'm afraid you got it in the wrong place [Music] you are in a wrong place just heal yourself to the Holy Ghost amen not my Will May said be unto me according to your word not according to my ideology she never figured it out how can a virgin you know when the conception when we were at school the other day we were told when the con going to take place there must be a man and then the union and you know you see she said be unto me according to your word and when she say that Hallelujah the Holy Ghost was excited he said the power of the most high will shatter you amen and when she believed Hallelujah life began developing in her womb the violent take it by force where from the time of our fathers from the time of the Patriarchs amen they never got it on a silver plate Jesus God in flesh fasted for 40 days Brother Martin are you sending us to fast for 40 days no but you must fast praise be to God you need to get some time with the Lord yes have you ever been in the bush have ever been in abandoned sight praying you must have your altar somewhere maybe behind your kitchen maybe in the bathroom you can even pray in the bathroom praise be to God because it's the violent that take it by force you are going to receive your marriage by force we are going to receive our blessing by force because God has already proclaimed it he has already declared it it's up to you to come up amen and go to the angel and go say God you said it's written I have come I want this I must receive it am praise be to God let us amend our ways let us break our F grounds and let us be let us go before the Lord amen even when you are beaten but as long as you are here Apostle Paul tells us though we are beaten on every side amen sometime you are bitten by stress sometime depression try to come sometime you are beaten by false Brethren they assures you falsly Cactus Brothers they are full of thorns every time they come near you they will never have kind word to any brother but we are not destroyed though we are perplexed amen though we are cast it down but we are not finished blessed be the name of the Lord why because we have a God who gave us the promise he gave us his word and we know we are living by that word blessed be the name of the Lord we are not going to be defeated I just have some few quotes as I'm finishing listen to this quote where it's a condation of where I've read where he say that you already in a wrong place Christians sometime look
