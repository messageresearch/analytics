Shall we pray? Kind, precious Lord Jesus, we come before the throne of grace this evening. Lord, we thank you for this great opportunity you have given us, Lord, to hear, Father, from thy throne of grace. Heavenly Father, your word tells us that whatever two or three gathers in your name, you'll come Lord and be in their midst, Lord. Father, we have turned, Lord Jesus. We have come here, loving master, gathering around your word. And Father, we invite you to come in a special way and speak to our hearts. Lord Jesus, we are coming through the door of the blood of Jesus Christ because that is the only way we can approach thy throne of grace. Oh God, heavenly father, we pray that we lay the blood of Jesus Christ tonight and may you wash us with your precious blood, have mercy upon us, Lord Jesus. We ask you to forgive us for our sins, trespasses, short shortcomings, our sins of commission and of omission. Lord, be merciful unto our iniquities, Lord Jesus. As your word tells us that we draw nearer unto you and also draw near unto us. We have come tonight drawing farther near to your throne of grace. We ask you Lord Jesus that come and sanctify me Lord and sanctify the congregation as well as you spoke father to Moses and you told him to gather the people and speak to the rock though the rock will give off its waters Lord Jesus. Father we have gathered here to speak to the rock. Oh God, come Lord Jesus and anoint me Lord. Take me out of the way and speak to your children. Father, you know the desires of our heart. You know what is happening around us, Lord Jesus. But we know it's only you who have the words of eternal life. Father, one time you came in the den of lion, Lord Jesus, and you block the mouth of lion from devouring Daniel. May the same presence come down that will close my mouth from my own word and Jesus you will utter your oracle to your children tonight. Father we remember those who are still on the way that will quicken their footstep. Bless all the ministers and our pastor in the most precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. May the Lord bless you this evening. Hallelujah. I greet you all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Yeah. And I want to thank God for the grace, the opportunity he has given me this evening. And also I want to appreciate our pastor uh for giving me this opportunity to stand before you saints. Uh it has taken some time but I believe it is the right time. Praise be to God. Amen. Yeah. Shall we turn to our Bible? I just have some I just have a thought that I want us to share tonight. And you go with me to the book of Jeremiah. Jeremiah chapter five. Okay, let's uh you turn with me to Romans. We shall come back to Jeremiah. Romans chapter 8 vers 12. Romans chapter 8, if you're there, you say amen. Uh it says that therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh. For if you live after the flesh, you shall you shall die. But if you if ye through the spirit do modify the deeds of the body, you shall live. For as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God. For you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry aba father. Lord Jesus, we thank you for the portion of the scripture we have read this evening and also for other scripture we read. Lord, I just pray that you come this evening and speak to our hearts. Father, in this time that you're going to spend here, come and encourage us. Come and revive us, Lord Jesus. Come and renew us, Lord God. That is the cry of my heart. That will be only you speaking to our hearts, Lord. Receive the glory, Lord, in Christ Jesus we pray. Amen. You will may have your seats. Uh I have something that I want us to share tonight. And uh I'm going to talk about uh design to overcome. Praise be to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Just pray for me uh that the Holy Spirit will speak to you. I want to talk about that design to overcome. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You see, there is a scripture in Jeremiah as Marvin is getting into us where he says that before we were formed in our mother's womb, he knew us. Amen. The Lord spoke to Jeremiah when he was sending Jeremiah and told him, "I've called you to be a prophet to the nation." Amen. Praise be to God. And uh if you read that scripture, you find Jeremiah giving excuses. You say, "But God, I am still young." And the Bible says the Lord told him, "Do not say that." Praise be to God. Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee. And before thou comest forth out of the womb, I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet unto nations. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So I will flow uh alongside that thought where he say that before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee and I will call my text designed to overcome. Blessed be the name of the Lord. You see, whatever happens around us or whichever challenges we meet in this life, praise be to God, God knew it before the foundation of the world. And God knows it very well that you have that potential. You have that ability to go through whatever comes your way. Amen. Because it's God leading us in this journey. Praise be to God. He called us. We did not call him. And the Bible tells us he loved us. He first loved us before we loved him. Praise be to God. Our love to God is just a response toward his love for us. Praise be to God. Amen. And I just want us to encourage ourself this evening. I want you and me to know that uh that what you are today that is how God has designed you and where you are he has designed you to be in this very place. &gt;&gt; You are not here by coincidence. You are not here as an accident. Amen. But you are in the right place where God saw you were way back before even you were born. Amen. And I'm here to tell you that what you are today, that's what God has made you to be. &gt;&gt; And God knows that no matter what you are going through, no matter the challenges you are facing, he is going to see you through because he designed you. Amen. With all the ability and the quality to overcome. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. We were in God's mind. We have heard that over and over. We have read it in the scripture. We have heard it in the message that before the foundation of the world, we were in the mind of God. And today we are the children of God, the sons of God manifested. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. is just like a a a builder or a carpenter, someone who came out with this pullpit here. When you find him there battling with uh timbers, you may not know what he's going to make. Praise be to God. These are two different design that we have here. But inside the carpenter's mind, he already has a picture. God designed him in the way that inside him is going to come out with a right picture of what is in his mind. And when you see him busy working, cutting this point is hammering this side, you may not know. Praise be to God. It's just like taking your clothes to a tailor. He will cut it until if you are if your heart is weak, you will complain because you will cut this part and throw the other side and you are seeing a a big portion of your clothes. You bought it expensively. Praise be to God. But because you are not a tailor, you will not know what he is doing. But inside his mind, he knows that you want a suit maybe a fitting. Amen. AND IS THROUGH ALL THOSE STAGES and process is going to come out with the right attire for you. Blessed be the name of the lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. So that's how God also design us. We want there are things many time we are faced with a lot of THINGS BUT AMIDST ALL those things. Amen. We are designed we are the perfect design of God. Amen. And we are unchallengeable. &gt;&gt; Whichever thing that comes OUR WAY, GOD DESIGNED us in a way that is not even shaken when we are going through this thing. Because he know that what he has put in us is more than able, more than enough. Amen. For us to go through what we are going through. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. When God called us, he called us to the battle. Amen. And we know that we are in the battle. &gt;&gt; We are undergoing training. Praise be to God. EVERY TIME WE COME HERE, we are working on uh we are in fact we are getting more training every day. Praise be to God. Ever since we believed, the day you believed is the day we join this battle. Is the day we join the army of the Lord. Praise be to God. AND FOR ALL THIS TIME WE ARE UNDERGOING TRAINING. Praise the Lord. And we have reached the point of the final battle. &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. AND GOD KNOWS THAT WE ARE MORE THAN ABLE. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He has GIVEN US EVERYTHING THAT WE need &gt;&gt; to overcome this time to overcome THIS GENERATION TO OVERCOME OUR PROBLEM. Praise be to God. He has given us his word. Amen. AND THE ONLY THING WE NEED, WE NEED THE QUICKENING POWER. Praise be to God. THAT WHEN THE HOLY GHOST COMES IN OUR LIVES AND QUICKEN that seed. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what we need. Praise the Lord. The Bible say that when the spirit that raised Christ from the dead, when he dwelleth in us, he will quicken our mortal body. &gt;&gt; Inside us, there is something that need to be quickened. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And when God comes, he comes to activate that he put in us. That's what he activates. Praise be to God. I remember one time recent when uh our pastor told us that the word of God will only quicken the seed of God in you. The word will not change you but it will quicken that part that is in you. Praise be to God. THAT THE WORD DOES NOT CHANGE THE SEED in us but it quicken it. If it is a good seed, it will manifest. If it is a wrong seed, still it will manifest. Praise be to God. But I trust that all of us we are good seeds. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. And that's why we are here tonight. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; God designed us to overcome. &gt;&gt; Each time God looks at us is seeing overcomers. You know many time when we are challenged we think that now we have lost our salvation. Brother, sister tell me one man whom God has ever called who never had a wickedness. Praise be to God. All of them they had their weaknesses. But regardless of their weaknesses, God knew that they were the right candidate, the right warriors for that battle, for that specific time. Praise be to God. And that's how he designed them. Even as in this generation, in your weakness, that point where you think you are defeated, brother, you are not defeated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In your design there is no defeat &gt;&gt; because this is the working of God. God is the master engineer. He engineered you in the way that INSIDE YOU THERE IS SOMETHING that even the devil cannot mess with. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; The only thing the devil CAN DO IS TRYING to discourage you. And when we are discouraged, we are dis we are disconnected to that. Praise be to God. BUT WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH, HALLELUJAH, &gt;&gt; we are coming for innovation. &gt;&gt; ALL THOSE CHANNELS TO BE UNCLOGGED, ALL those wires, PRAISE BE TO GOD, WHERE THEY LOSE CONTACT WHEN THE WORD COMES. AMEN. THE WORD WORKS ON THAT AREA. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And by THE TIME WE LEAVE, WE GO WHEN WE ARE charged &gt;&gt; because inside us already, we have that flow. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; The flow OF THE HOLY GHOST FLOWS IN OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL FIGHTS SO HARD to make us go astray because he knows that's the only way he can disconnect us from that. Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us that which man is that when he's going to build a house, he not first sit and count the cost less you build and you stop on the way. Praise be to God. And then people will laugh at you because you never calculated before you started your building. But God is not that kind of builder. And that's why when Moses realized that in the wilderness when God wanted to destroy Israelites, praise be TO GOD, THE BIBLE TELLS US MOSES, GOD TOLD MOSES, "STEP ASIDE AND I SHOW THEM." AMEN. &gt;&gt; But Moses stood in the gap. Hallelujah. and say that God what WILL THE HEATHEN NATION SAY THAT THEIR GOD WAS NOT EVEN ABLE TO TAKE THEM TO THE PROMISED LAND. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God already he had already calculated the cost. That challenge was not only to the people of Israel but also to Moses. I believe that God wanted to see what will Moses do. Will Moses step aside and destroy them? Praise be to God. Amen. But still God knew that the way HE DESIGNED MOSES, MOSES would stood in the gap because HE WAS REPRESENTING CHRIST as well. AMEN. THAT FOR GOD SO LOVED THE WORLD THAT HE GAVE HIS ONLY BEGOTTEN SON. &gt;&gt; When God wanted to destroy the world, he sent his son BECAUSE OF TOO MUCH LOVE. THOEVER BELIEVES in him. Amen. should not be perished. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So that SAME GOD WHO CALLED us in this generation, the message is not easy, brethren. The message is so hard. Praise be to God. But God knows that we are going to make it &gt;&gt; because the message does not give you even It will all tell you look unto Christ. &gt;&gt; Look away to Jesus. Amen. When trouble come, look away to Jesus. When you are going through tough time, look away to Jesus. When you are sick, look away to Jesus. Amen. When someone lives here, maybe uh it's money and you are broke. Look away to Jesus. Praise be to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I remember a few just a few days ago I went to the shop in the morning. It was uh it was uh I think few weeks ago uh my wife had just given birth. We had spent everything that we had. So that morning uh I think I had I had something like 10,000. says I was going to shop then I found 70,000. Praise be to God. Ah and I was like just in front of the the shop. The shop attendant was inside and guess what would you do? Praise be to God. Ah that was the only thing I heard. So the devil started to preach to me. God has provided. And I was like, wait a minute. Yeah, God has provided. By the way, God answers prayer. Indeed, I prayed, but that was not the answer. Praise be to God. So I I picked the money and I told the the lady there that by the you have dropped here your money. Say no but it's not my money. said but it's okay. So she uh there was a yogurt guy he had come to supply her. So I think in the process of uh maybe putting the money or moving the change it was the money for the guy and the guy also did not know that dropped the money. So he said she said okay then he called the guy by the way have you okay I'm not sure whether it was the guy's money because you see when I have a note even if it is 1 million or 500,000 I know all the denomination of my money but uh somehow maybe it was for that gentleman but you know at first when I saw it honestly I'm not one person who steps on the money. Let me give you this testimony. One time I was very sick and I was from a site and I did not have money. I said God it was my I think I was suffering from malaria alongside when I was walking after believing God. I saw some notes flying in the wind because see God has provided for sure that one I believe it was God. Ask me why people were up moving border borders and they are not seeing the money. So I picked it gently like my money and guess what it was exact because I went to the immediate I went to the pharmacy bought the drug side with I think I'm not for buying milk. So that one I believed it was God because nobody was concerned. I think they also thought that maybe I had dropped my money. I was picking my money. It was just on the road. But this time around, the devil knew that if I trick this gentleman, he's not going to overcome that. But I thank God. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. First of all, but the prophet SAY THAT WHEN YOU HAVE SECOND THOUGHT, do not do it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; And that's how I overcame that snare. And just a few days I think like &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are designed the way God designed us. He knows very well brethren that we are more than able to overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to tell that WE ARE DESIGNED THAT IS NOT THE END OF YOU BECAUSE EVEN WHEN WE ARE IN SCHOOL WHEN WE ARE BEATEN WHEN THE PAPER DEFEATS YOU YOU DO CORRECTION YOU TRY AGAIN AGAIN until you overcome that. Praise be to God. And let US USE THE SAME SAME TACTICS. PRAISE the Lord. BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT THE DEVIL WANT. HE USES the condition around us to DETERMINE WHO WE ARE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE LEARNED, AMEN. TO LIFT UP MY EYES AND LOOK AT GOD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. TO SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF MY GOD. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Sometime the devil shows us how small we are. But when I START SINGING BIGGER THAN all my problem is bigger than anything. PRAISE BE TO GOD. SOMETIME WHEN I'M WALKING AND I'M OVERWHELMED BY THOUGHT THAT IS THE SONG THAT I SING IS BIGGER THAN ALL MY QUESTIONS. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; AND MANY TIME YOU HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS WITHOUT ANSWERS. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But God is the only one who is responsible. &gt;&gt; He knows everything about us. Brother, sometime many time you you find you are somewhere where you can you you will even hardly utter the name of Jesus. But even in that situation, something inside your HEART TELLS YOU THAT YOU ARE MORE than overcomer. &gt;&gt; And that's what has kept us going. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; When things are not moving, brother says THAT WHEN YOU ARE TRYING TO DO SOMETHING AND YOU FIND IS HARD, THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME OF DOING IT. WHEN YOU TRY TO PRAY AND EVEN WORDS ARE NOT COMING OUT OF YOUR MOUTH, BROTHER, THAT IS THE RIGHT TIME to pray. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he told Jeremiah before even you were formed in your mother's womb, I knew you. I called you. I ordained you. BEFORE THE MINISTERS LAY THEIR HANDS ON YOU FOR ORDINATION, GOD ALREADY SANCTIONED IT. Praise be to God. Before David became the king, GOD ALREADY HAD sanctioned it. AMEN. SAMUEL WAS JUST FULFILLING THAT. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; That's why when David saw Goliath, Goliath never knew the secret in David. Amen. David was designed THAT WAY THAT ONE DAY, PRAISE the Lord, I believe before DAVID WAS BORN, THE LORD DECLARED IT UPON DAVID AND SAY THAT ONE DAY YOU ARE GOING TO SLAY A GIANT. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And maybe even David never knew that. But something was in him. THERE WAS SOMETHING DRIVING HIM IN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; You remember Hebrew mothers when they were giving birth, the Bible tells us they speak Hallelujah. phobia. Hallelujah. So, brethren, I'm here to tell you that we are built upon the rock. Amen. And we cannot be moved. &gt;&gt; And that rock is called Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word which was tested. Hallelujah. The word which cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells us in Matthew 7:24. Whosoever hears this word. Hallelujah. AND DOETH IT IS AS a man who build his house upon the rock. Hallelujah. And that rock is Christ. &gt;&gt; When we hear this word and do it, we are building our house upon the rock. &gt;&gt; And there's no way we can be overcome. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Nothing can shake US BECAUSE OUR BUILDING is built on the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Many time we are not victorious. IT'S BECAUSE AS WE ARE move but God want us to keep walking. Amen. Keep moving on to keep pressing on. Praise be TO GOD. ONE TIME I PREACH a sermon here uh which I call it that we are pressurized to STAND NO MATTER WHAT comes our way. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE PRESSURIZED TO STAND. There's nothing that can PUT US DOWN. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN CHALLENGE US BECAUSE THE ONE WHO WENT AHEAD OF US, THE ONE WHO WENT BEFORE US, HALLELUJAH, IT TOOK BITTER CUP. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; JESUS CARRIED THE BIGGER part of IT UNTIL TIME CAME AND HE THOUGHT if it was possible to dodge it. Hallelujah. BUT WHEN HE LOOKED AT US, he say, "Let me face the cross." &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Brother Bonam in this message uh message of show the father and safias he says that that is how you see that god that's how you see god is when you get inside when you get inside of you let him look through your eyes and that is how you will work for God when God can use your hands amen your feet your lips Use your tongue, use your ears, and use your eyes. God is in you. See God on the outside. So uh in 1 Corinthians chapter 1 26 it say that for you see you are calling brethren HOW THAT NOT MANY WISE men after the after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called. BUT GOD HAS CHOSEN THE foolish things of the world to confound the wise. AND GOD HAS CHOSEN the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty. Praise be to God. God has chos. Amen. Are you seeing how we are designed by the world? We look like we look like foolish and very weak. The character of the weak person is he can't even fight back. Someone comes and slaps and say God bless you. Why? Because you are weak. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; SOMETIME WE ARE HARASSED even by our neighbors. But you don't fight back because brother you are weak things of the world. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; But it's because the battle is not ours. You see, God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things that are mighty and best things of the world and the things which are despised. Hath God chosen? Yeah. And things which are not to bring to not things THAT ARE THAT NO flesh should glory in his presence. Praise be to God. Everything is about God doing it. The way we are, that's how he made us. We are different from ONE ANOTHER. BUT EACH one of us, we are designed to overcome. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And by the help of God, each one of us will overcome. &gt;&gt; We already overcoming. PRAISE BE TO GOD. EVERY DAY WE ARE overcoming something. AND WE ARE moving unto perfection. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are not what you used to be or WHAT YOU WERE YESTERDAY, &gt;&gt; BUT every single day we are moving toward perfection. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So we should always tell the devil, make the devil know that we are overcomers. We are designed to overcome. Praise be to God. He said, "I NOTICED THAT IT TAKES THE WEAKEST and the rejected AND PRACTICALLY EVERY HERO GOD EVER HAD ON THE FRONT line was the type of that person, the type of a person. Blessed be the name of the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. No matter what we are facing, I am designed to overcome. Sometime the mountain seems to be bigger. Praise be to God. But we are bigger than it. Right now we have a lot before us. Amen. But I'm here to tell you if you press on, IF YOU MOVE ON believing God, AMEN. AND WAITING ON GOD IS PROMISES. HALLELUJAH. WE ARE GOING TO OVERCOME BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT WE ARE. &gt;&gt; THE COUNTRY WHERE WE CAME FROM IS OF OVERCOMERS IS THE COUNTRY OF POSSIBILITY. IT IS POSSIBLE. I WILL MAKE IT. I'M GOING THROUGH. I'M MANEUVERING THROUGH. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THERE IS NO NEGATIVITY. THERE IS NO DEFEAT THE OTHER SIDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And those are the principles that is keeping us going. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord proclaimed it. HE DECLARED IT BEFORE EVEN WE ARE BORN THAT WE are going to make it. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That we are going through. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. That's why you have bared. You've been under several sermons sometime but you have not given up because you are designed that way. &gt;&gt; PRAISE THE LORD. EVERY SERMON FITS SOMETHING IN US. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE GOD IS BUILDING a building. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Every minister COMES WITH A STONE. THE OTHER ONE COMES with motor. This one comes with this. Praise be TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS WORKING ON THAT BUILDING. He's fitting us in our right places. Just allow the Holy Ghost to work in you. Let the Holy Spirit work in us. LET HIM TIGHTEN those loose ends. SOMETIME PEOPLE FORGET THAT THEY ARE CHRISTIANS. THEN THEY BECOME SO LOOSE AND TOO LOW. PRAISE BE TO GOD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, THAT IS not what you are. GOD CALLED US TO BE BETTER than that. We are the masterpiece of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 41:14 SAY THAT FEAR NOT Jacob for thou warm Jacob I'll help thee behold I'll make thee a new sharp threshing instrument having teeth and thou shalt rejoice in the Lord Gideon praise be to God I want to read uh I want a scripture in Judges can we go there. Judges chapter 6. I want to see something here. Judges chapter 6 11. And there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an oak and an oak which was in opera that pertain unto Josh and Abisite. And his son Gideon threshed uh threshed wheat by the wine press to hide it from the Midionite. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him, The Lord is with thee, thou mighty man of valor. And Gon said unto HIM, "OH MY GOD, IF THE LORD IS WITH US, why then is all this befallen us? Blessed be the name of the Lord." This a mighty man. But he had forgotten who he was. AND HERE COMES the angel to remind him of who he was. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. HE WAS TRYING TO HIDE WHAT HE HAD. PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN HE HAD the Midionite had come, praise the Lord. He started to hide. But the angel reminded him that man, you are mighty man of valor. You are designed to overcome these guys. &gt;&gt; HE WAS PRAISE BE TO GOD. GOD HAD TO SEND AN ANGEL TO REMIND HIM OF WHO he was. &gt;&gt; ALWAYS GOD WILL SEND AN ANGEL. PRAISE THE LORD. TO REMIND THE CHURCH OF WHO THEY ARE. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. In this generation we are living in, WE THOUGHT WE WERE LIKE OTHER DENOMINATION, OTHER ORGANIZATION. PRAISE THE LORD. BUT GOD SENT AN ANGEL IN THIS GENERATION TO REMIND US OF WHO WE ARE. Blessed be the NAME OF THE LORD. WHEN we denomination, we even we used to be challenged and you hide. You don't even want to see that you are Christian. We thought it was a shame to be a Christian. AMEN. WE THOUGHT WE ARE LIKE OTHERS, BRETHREN. AMEN. BUT IN THIS GENERATION, PRAISE THE LORD, WHEN GOD SAW THAT THAT WE WERE DESIGNED TO OVERCOME THIS GENERATION, HE HAD TO SEND AN ANGEL TO REMIND US OF who we are. &gt;&gt; We are just like Gideon. We are just like him. When the enemy comes, we hide. Praise the Lord. The same thing happened when the Israel in the BATTLE AND WHEN DAVID WENT THERE. AMEN. AND GOLIATH ROSE AND THESE guys hid themselves. Praise be to God. And the young man who had meet an ANGEL WHO HAD AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD. HE HAD THE BEAR EXPERIENCE AND THE LION EXPERIENCE. PRAISE THE LORD. WHEN HE HAD SOME WEIRD WEIRD SOUND, SAY, "What is that thing nagging me?" Amen. Praise be to God. But this man knew what the young man knew what he was talking about. HE HAD AN EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS UNDISPUTED. IT WAS UNCHALLENGEABLE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND DAVID KNEW FROM THE FIRST EXPERIENCE THAT I AM DESIGNED TO OVERCOME. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THE SECOND EXPERIENCE, IT WAS THE CONFIRMATION OF THE FIRST ONE. PRAISE BE TO GOD. GOD WAS NOT PREPARING DAVID TO SLAY THE BEAR AND THE LION, BUT GOD WAS PREPARING HIM TO SLAY GOLIATH. &gt;&gt; PRAISE BE TO GOD. THE BEAR WAS NOT THE PROBLEM OF ISRAELITE. THE LION WAS NOT THE PROBLEM OF THE ISRAELITE. BUT GOLIATH WAS THE PROBLEM. &gt;&gt; And what was the problem OF THE CHURCH? IT WAS BECAUSE OF THEIR UNBELIEF. &gt;&gt; PRAISE be to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. BUT GOD HAD PREPARED somebody and David WAS COMING TO FACE THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE DAVID HAD AN EXPERIENCE with God. HE KNEW WHERE HE WAS STANDING. HE KNEW THE GOD OF ISRAEL. HE KNEW THAT UNCIRCUMCISED PHILISTINE COULD NOT CHALLENGE, COULD NOT DEFY THE CHURCH OF THE LIVING GOD. AND OUR PROPHET TELLS US, AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE CHURCH WILL PUT OUT THE FEAR. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THAT SCARE WILL GET OUT OF THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; Praise be TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHAT WAS AFFECTING the church of Israelites. They forgot that God was their king, that God was their fighter. God gave THEM A PROMISE AND HE TOLD THAT ONE OF YOU, ONE MAN WILL CHASE A THOUSAND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; One man chasing a thousand people. ONE SAMSON. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT HERE THOUSAND men hiding. Why? It was because of the unbelief. And said that your unbelief will not hinder God. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; AND LET US NOT STAND ON SOMEBODY'S WAY. If you CAN'T BELIEVE FOR YOUR HEALING, THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN BELIEVE FOR HIS HEALING. &gt;&gt; DO NOT STAND ON HIS WAY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN'T BELIEVE FOR YOUR VICTORY THAT YOU CAN OVERCOME FORNICATION, YOU CAN OVERCOME ADULTERY, YOU CAN OVERCOME THIS AND THAT, THERE IS SOMEBODY BELIEVING BROTHER, SISTER, THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE DESIGNED BY GOD. THERE ARE MEN WHO ARE ENGINEERED BY GOD. HALLELUJAH. THERE ARE MEN HAVE MET GOD. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT. THEY KNOW THE EXPERIENCE THEY HAD WITH GOD. THEY KNOW THAT WITH GOD ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. NOT JUST SOME THINGS BUT ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE BECAUSE THEY TESTED AND I SEE HOW THAT GOD IS GRACIOUS. Blessed be the name of the Lord. AND GOD TODAY IS BUILDING THE SAME SAME TEMPLE. HALLELUJAH. Is working through it. IS TYING THE loose connections. PRAISE BE TO GOD. THAT IS THE GOD WE ARE SERVING. EVEN WHEN YOU ARE BEATEN DOWN, BROTHER, THERE ARE JUST SOME loopholes somewhere. There are SOME LOOSE CONNECTION SOMEWHERE. COME TO THE ALTAR. COME TO THE ALTAR. LET THE HOLY GHOST WORK ON THOSE LOOSE ENDS. LET THE HOLY GHOST TIGHTEN THOSE LOOSE ENDS. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND YOU WILL LEAVE YOUR LIKE A FIRE WITH A DEVIL. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; SO THAT GOD was still with them. But God was not where they baptizing kids. He was a backsliden preacher. We can say that. Praise be to God. And that's why when David was going when he was ready to face Goliath, he told him, "Son, you cannot manage that guy. You go with this. Go with this bachelor in theology. Go with this catechasm baptism of babies. Go with this holy water. At least you sprink it around and first jump jump there before you go. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; David tried it, brother. When he tried to lift his the man's spear alone was ALSO HEAVY. THE ELEMENT. Praise be to God. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THINGS WERE HEAVY FOR DAVID. PRAISE BE TO GOD. I BELIEVE THIS GUY REMEMBERED. THE YOUNG ONE REMEMBERED, "LAY ASIDE EVERY WEIGHT AND EVERY SIN THAT IS BESET YOU AND RUN WITH PATIENCE." PRAISE BE TO GOD. HE REMEMBER THAT WHEN HE WAS LAYING THE LION, he never used even a sword. And in that conversation, maybe the king asked him, "How are you going to do it?" Then he asked the the king, "Have you ever slayed a lion?" Say, "There's no one who can slay a lion." Okay. How about a bear? When a bear stands with, "Do you know what you're talking about?" Maybe he had never even seen it. Praise be to God. David knew that oh this where the problem is that you can't cast Satan in father son and the holy ghost said okay king just watch and see what is the price you are giving praise be to god &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE PRICE YOU ARE GIVING brother you only leave and the king said maybe let's try and see. I believe inside the king's heart in that yeah there is something unique about this person. That's why we need that experience to have that time alone with God. Praise be to God. WHEN WE COME OUT EVERYBODY WILL SAY indeed there is something unique about that brother about that sister because we are designed that way brethren that's what we are the devil makes us to believe of what we are not we looked at ourself as miners brother that's not what we are praise be to god &gt;&gt; before we were BORN GOD PROPHESIED SIDE OVER OUR LIVES. &gt;&gt; Before we came in THIS WORLD, GOD SAID SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SEE THAT ONE IS OVERCOMER. THAT ONE IS A PREACHER. THIS ONE IS A SONG LEADER. THIS ONE IS A PIANIST. PRAISE BE TO GOD. IT WAS PROCLAIMED OVER YOU BEFORE EVEN YOU WERE BORN, BROTHER, SISTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. So let us not allow the enemy to play with our mind. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Gideon, he never even knew that he was an overcomer. He was a mighty man of valor. But God sent an angel. And in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, &gt;&gt; God sent us an angel in this generation. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he has helped us to know who we ARE THAT WE are even GREATER THAN ANGELS BECAUSE HE TELLS US THAT ANGELS ARE SERVANT BUT WE ARE SONS OF GOD. &gt;&gt; WE ARE THE BRIDE AND HE SAID I NO LONGER CALL YOU MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HE HAS REVEALED US THAT WE ARE MISS JESUS. THE BRIDE OF CHRIST, &gt;&gt; WE CAME OUT OF HIS RIB. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; THROUGH THAT ANGEL, WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KNOW WHEN JESUS WAS HANGED ON THE CROSS, we were with him. &gt;&gt; When he went TO THE GRAVE, BROTHER, SISTER, WE WENT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BECAUSE THAT IS HOW WE ARE DESIGNED. WHEN HE WENT TO HELL, WE WENT WITH HIM. WHEN HE CAME OUT OF THE HELL, WE CAME OUT WITH HIM. &gt;&gt; That is our blueprint. That is our design. Praise be to God. And that's why we are going to reign with him. &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; How do we know about those things? Bible time. That's what God has always been doing. &gt;&gt; When they encourage, send somebody to in when they're discouraged to encourage them. Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You know, a soldier who has never been in a battle doesn't know what overcoming means. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Do you know that when soldiers are going to war, they pack with them everything they're going to need in the battle? Huge backpack with a mattress with a water on the side, grenade, food, energetically modified food capsules. The devil copy from God. Do you know that some of those soldiers they don't have time to cook but they use science and they get those nutrients in the food and put it maybe in a capsule form. You just eat maybe you swallow a capsule like two and it is equivalent to a kg of kawonga and beanies because where you going there will be no time brother. I am that trouble &gt;&gt; because that's what we are. If you thunder to the devil, we are trouble to the devil. &gt;&gt; SO GOD IS DOING USING THE SAME mechanism to prepare his church. Every time you come, you are working on your military attire and the midter is the word OF GOD. WE ARE PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ELEMENT OF SALVATION, THE SWORD OF THE SPIRIT. PRAISE BE TO GOD. AND AMONG OTHERS. And the Bible tells us to be aware of his devices. Amen. Many time we forget who of us standing many time does not even use that because when the devil comes spiritually he's weak blessed be the name of the lord but when he get a vessel to work in that's where he can also display his power so when he had golth that was a good a good vessel In fact that was unique vessel prepared six I think he had six six fingers praise be to God was very tall his spear alone carried by men's not one not two he has to scare you by the time You fight already. There is even no life out of you, inside you. Praise be to God. But thanks God that he has given us the word. &gt;&gt; When the devil attacked Jesus said, "It is written." Amen. You see the world, they are not ashamed of who they are. Do you know that? You believe that? They're not ashamed. Someone wakes up and tells you this is who I am. This illame women they don't fear to say who they are. BUT SOMETIME MANY TIME CHRISTIAN THEY ARE scared even to tell the world of who they are. Praise be to God. That's why we need to get that experience with God. Blessed be the name of the Lord because the king couldn't hardly convince David that something happened in the wilderness. He was alone when he was slaying the bear. He was alone with God. He was not there with his brothers, with his father, with the king. He was there alone. You are going to meet God alone. No. Blessed be the name of the Lord. And that's what each one of us need. If we don't meet God, we're not going to make it. Every single day, the way is getting narrow and narrow. Life is getting hard and hard outside Christ. So meaning as far as life is getting hard outside believer, we also ought to be fighting to enter in because that's the only refuge. The present hope in time of trouble. The earth is already experiencing undergoing another birth pain and we are in the time we are nearing the time of delivery. Blessed be the name of the Lord. So we ought to run to Christ because that's the only place of safety. &gt;&gt; And I'm just here to REMIND YOU THAT WE ARE DESIGNED TO OVERCOME. WE ARE DESIGNED TO be there. &gt;&gt; It is very very possible. &gt;&gt; And that's where God want us TO BE. HE WANT US TO BE ON THE WINNING SIDE. THAT'S WHY I WANT THE CHURCH TO BE ON THE FIERY side &gt;&gt; where men and WOMEN ARE SEEKING GOD NIGHT AND DAY. &gt;&gt; WHERE WE ARE NOT settling for less. Praise the Lord. WHERE WE SAY ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE. &gt;&gt; If I TRY AND I DON'T GET TOMORROW, I will come back. EVEN IF I DIE, WHEN I'VE NOT GOT IT, EVEN WHERE I'M GOING, AS LONG AS THERE is life there, I will still keep trying. &gt;&gt; Praise be to God. BECAUSE WHEN GOD gives his word, his word will never fail. &gt;&gt; IT MAY TAKE THOUSANDS OF YEARS, but it will come to pass. &gt;&gt; As long as has come out OF HIS MOUTH, GOD TRIED THIS WORD BEFORE even he gave it to man. Praise be to God. And he TRUST THAT THIS THE ONLY thing that can work for us. And we are here today. It's up to us to believe or to leave it there. Blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; But God, he has done his part. And the prophet say that if you can get that scare out of the church out of a believer there is that portion of it doesn't work. Will we make it to our land? The three months have elapsed. Praise be to God. The speed which God gave to to that is the maximum speed for it. But who tells that a tortoise that does not reach its destination? Praise be to God. Even in our nature, some of us we are taller than others. But when you're going to Charala, the difference is just in the steps we are taking. But each of each one of us will reach the destination. Praise be to God. So brethren, we are not too late. But according the way God designed us, we are on the right track and we are is that nothing can stop us. Blessed be the name of the Lord. Amen. Shall we stand on our feet tonight? Precious Lord Jesus, Father, we want to thank you given us to hear from your throne. You told us in your holy word that we conffort one another with these words. Lord Jesus, your word has been preached and you're reminding us of who we are. I just want to thank you for this moment. I pray that may the Holy Spirit visit each one of us. Lord, as you say, the sacred things belongs to you. But those which are revealed, they are ours and for our children. When it was revealed to Gideon, you had to make sure that he went and listened to the conversation between the million. one giving the dream and the other one interpreting. The enemy is dreaming and interpreting when your servant was listening. Precious Lord, we know that we're living the time. Remember Apostle Paul writing Timothy and told him that Timothy in last days or later days preious time will come. And that's the time we are living in Lord Jesus. We are seeing a lot of things happening Lord. But he told us that when we see this, we ought to look up for our redemption draws nearer. And we know that our salvation is closer than when we had just believed. Precious Lord, and you clear the way for us, Lord Jesus. We just pray that we release your anointing this evening and break every yoke. Speak to those who are streaming this service. As we pray for the offerings, we'll also remember to pray for sister Patricia. Uh she's in the hospital attending to her brother who has cancer. So we remember her in prayer. We praise the Lord. Oh dear gracious heavenly father, pray for the tithan offerings. Father, Lord, I pray Lord Jesus. So my God that tonight you'll bless every giver Lord the Father has given in thine house. Lord, I pray, Father, that you bless bless the labor of their hands, Father. Lord Jesus, bless all that they have. And Lord Jesus, fulfill the desires of their hearts, Father, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Lord, and this evening, Father, we remember Sister Patricia, Lord, Father, who is not with us here today. Remember her in prayers, Father, Lord Jesus, as she is at the hospital, Lord. We pray, Father, that you remember her, Lord. Reach down your mighty hand, your healing hand, Father, and touch the sick, Lord, and heal him. Oh, Father, you're the healer, Lord Jesus, of every disease, Father. Even heal cancer, Lord. Cancer can stand in your presence, can stand before you, Father. And now we speak thy word, Lord Jesus, that thy word will heal him, oh, Father, and Lord Jesus will comfort our sister, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ, we pray and believe. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Amen. So, uh, give the Lord a hand clap of praise this evening. Amen. Have we been blessed this evening? Hallelujah. So, we thank God for brother Martin. Amen.
