Let he sings [Music] thy Let's sing. &gt;&gt; Shall we bow our heads in a word of prayer? &gt;&gt; Gracious Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Sometimes we feel like Peter. We feel like Peter when you came to him and he said go away from me Lord for I am a sinful man. &gt;&gt; But you said come and follow me. I'll make thee fishermen. Dear God Almighty, as David said, if you would number all my iniquities, I could not stand. But blessed is that man whom the Lord does not impute in the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed on Calvary. Father, we are so thankful. It means so much to us. It has brought us together. in fellowship with your holiness and with your righteousness and with your promises. &gt;&gt; Dear God Almighty, I ask for your grace. As the song s was sung, I thought of myself as a mighty &gt;&gt; that I can do a lot on my own, &gt;&gt; but I can't even walk without you holding on. Precious Jesus, &gt;&gt; lover of my soul, &gt;&gt; savior of the universe, come Lord in our ministry and interrupt the service. Touch everyone's heart, each life, Lord, as the people have come today, not to hear from me, Lord, but to hear from you. He can minister to them something that will help them to bring them closer to thee because Lord you are all that matters. For these people Lord and needy and helpless. None can help them save the Lord Jesus. I do therefore commit them to thee. Sanctify us, oh Lord, for this thy great service. Come and fulfill your word. Bring it to come to pass. Bring it to life creating in every person here. The life of Jesus, it's not by power, not by might, but by my spirit. Take me out of the way. and my brother out of the way. Each one of us out of these people, Lord, a thirsty and hunger just this moment that they may catch what you want to give them. Oh God almighty, come and take over to the praise of your grace and of glory in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. You may take your seats. [Music] God richly shall bless you. Greetings to you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. received greetings from our dear pastor. I believe you are keeping him in prayers where he is in the missionary field. Uh he sent his greetings and a message to the church and to those that follow and to all the youths. And he said please register for the youth come 26 register now for better preparation. He kindly says please register and God will bless you. Amen. Amen. those that have made it in the conventions, God bless you for that and reward you. It's not in vain and I believe you will not remain the same. I believe you are not too satisfied spirituality that you can still have some space and I was wondering I said the people too satisfied what am I going to tell them because the they are in the convention what now will what more do I have I believe they are satisfied. &gt;&gt; But uh perhaps there's something small that God would have us to hear this morning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you once again for making it church today. It's a sacrifice to come to church every time and uh we find many people who seem not to understand us I was coming to church I think two weeks back I met there was a man in the taxi he was event, seventh advent and I'm he was really waiting for me to come [Music] to he was waiting for me to come because they had booked a seat for me there was I was seated the daughter of brother Martin he was really on fire for his doctrine He told me I wanted to talk to this young girl about it. You know they are the day they keep things like that. But I said let me wait for the pastor. I said I'm not a pastor. I'm just a Christian and oh you are going to church and things like that. They started in his dock. He said, "I've been waiting for you." I said, "Oh, I'm here." Said, "But why are you going too far? Why your pastor? There are no churches." I said, "I told him they are there. But God has called us to serve him. That's why we are going there. said all right. So why we make it here? It's not because it is easy. Sometimes we have to spend all our living all your living to make it here because you know this is more than that money. I know many of you do that. It's not in vain. God will surely bless you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Shall we stand on our feet? &gt;&gt; Oh, something in my heart like a stream running down. It makes me feel so happy as happy heart can be. When I think of Jesus and what he has done for me, there is something more than God in my soul. There is something more than God. Something in my heart like a stream running down. It makes me feel so happy as happy heart can be. When I think of Jesus and what he has done for me, there is something more than God. Amen. Amen. First Peter chapter 2 verse 9 to 12. It says, "But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, any holy nation, a peculiar people, that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light, which in time past were not a people, but are now the people of God, which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Dearly beloved, I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, having your conversation honesty among the Gentiles, that well, as they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. Amen. Soch. [Music] Amen. Amen. Let me take your seats, please. Shall we bow our heads in a word of prayer? Kind heavenly father we have read out of your word but you said it is given by inspiration. May your holy spirit take the word. Open the hearts of the people. Bless from me and my brother here. Bless us and all the entire congregation and add a blessing to your word. that we may all go back testifying. The Lord I thank you for what you have done in Jesus Christ name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you once again. God bless you once again. Amen. &gt;&gt; As pilgrims and strangers, that's my subject. As pilgrims and strangers, the scripture says, "But you are a chosen generation. and a chosen generation, a royal priesthood. Ye are bru of us together. He says we are one generation and that's a chosen generation. And he says all of us together, we are a royal priesthood. We are an holy nation. Remember God told the children of Israel, "The kingdom of God shall be taken from you and be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof. That nation you are." Then he says, "It's unholy nation. It doesn't matter. It's not about you. It's about God. He says you are unholy nation a vul that you should show forth the praises of him who has called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in time passed were not a people but are now the people of God. does not say in time past you are a people of some other sort. He says you are not even a people at all because man without the spirit of God is just a beast. He says in time past you are not a people but now now are the people of God. God has a people and those people you are which had not obtained mercy. You had not obtained mercy you are regarded as Gentiles in the flesh but now I've obtained mercy. He says now, "Dear beloved, he's speaking to a people." Look, he first he talks about who they are. He declares to them who they are. Then he says, "Dearly beloved, dearly beloved, I beseech you. I beseech you, as strangers and pilgrims, Abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul. There is a battle. There is a war and that's within you. Brother says this brother says that there is two dogs within me. They are fighting each other. One is dark, another one is white. One is evil, another one is good, which means the one you feed the most. He says there is war within you, the flesh against the soul, the lusts of the flesh against the soul. The flesh can't be saved. That's why he says flesh and blood not inherit the kingdom of God. Look brother, if God will make you an angel and on the outside still have this flesh, you will still remain a sinner. Look brother, it is about the change of the inner man. After the change of the inner man, the outward man will be consumed. If that spirit that was in Christ, it will quicken your mortal body. But for now, there is war within you, fighting within you. He says, I abstain from fleshly lust. Because the flesh was against the soul having your conversation honestly among the Gentiles. Sometimes you may think people are not seeing but they are saying I was surprised. This woman says I was surprised. &gt;&gt; I said all along she she said where do you fellowship from? I said days of the voice fellowship days of the voice fellowship. She said, "Where is it?" I said, "I'm going." I said, "Yes." Then she said, "This is the only person that I've ever seen and admired." You know what I felt? I felt ashamed of to God. I said, "God, me a sinner with all weaknesses." You hear what this woman is saying? Look, brother, this little light of mine, it's light in darkness. Hallelujah. She was a Muslim brother. And I was shocked because she wasn't my friend. She was far above me in position. What am I saying? These people are watching you even without your words. So he says, "Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that they speak against you as evildoers, They may by your good works which they shall behold glorify God in the day of visitation surely that was a Christian brother sister. He says not only beloved but dearly beloved. So dearly beloved, he says I beseech you. I beg you. I encourage you. I strengthen you. I comfort you as a pilgrims and strength. A stranger is one who comes from a foreign country into a country or city or a land to live there temporarily amidst the the natives of the land. He is there temporarily and he is recognized separated. by his character [Music] is known separated from the net by his character. This one is different. It doesn't act like a Uganda. His character is different. Brother is separated, by his characture, &gt;&gt; by his language, [Music] by the manner of life that he lives, by his or her addressing the you know you dress the way you want to be addressed. So the way you dress shows who you are. He says, "Oh, I'm saying that a pilgrim, a stranger is separated by the man of life they live, separated by their dress code. They are separated by what they eat." True, brother. You can't go to a strange country and you just start to eat what they eat all over. No, you will first look for the food you are used to. They separated by what they eat and by their behavior. Then when they see such a one this guy, this brother, this man, this woman, their cultures are different from ours. Their language is different from our man of life they live is different from ours. The way they dress is different from ours. What they eat is different from ours. Their behaviors are different. This is a stranger. You can't hide it brother because you are different. Then they say this one is different. But the moment the moment the moment he or she adopts to the characters of that friendship. Aha. And they adopt to eat and learn it and live do exactly that and and they adopt the language and the man of life and the dressing and the way the people behave. They cease to be a stranger. No one will recognize them as a stranger because they are just the same as the native. [Music] They become one like the natives of the [Music] so they are no longer strange. Dearly beloved, I beseech you as pilgrims and strangers. He says pilgrims and strangers you are. Therefore remain Brother, the Lord, the Lord lived in Sodom. He was a petty. [Music] He was purposed in his heart. There was something kind of different. I know he didn't have much of revelation, but there was something different that differentiated him. from the sodomite. Look brother Genesis 19 1-9 says it says here [Music] and there came two angels to Sodom at evening. Lot sat in the gate of Sodom. And Lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face towards the ground. And he said, "Behold now my Lord, turn in I pray you into your servant's house and all night and wash your feet." It says two angels. Remember the the Lord had remained with Abraham. To Abraham they were three and Abraham said, "My Lord is so one and not they come two. These were loss standing. I pray you eat your servants house and all night wash your feet and you shall rise up early. Go on your way." They said, But we will abide in the street. And he pressed upon them. They turned in unto him. Normally when someone tells me, will you eat? I tell them, no. But when they come to me, I know we are serving you. Here is your food. I don't move. But when they say will you eat I said no I'm really well I won't tell you the reason but the the reason it being that they asked me whether I will eat I presume it was not planned I do not want to interfere. Will you do this? I always say no. But it's just my mother taught me that. But I find it so true. If I should I give you? No. I said no. It's good to always just give. If God put someone on your heart, you text them and say, "Brother, sister, are you okay? What what they tell you, I'm okay. [Music] This this is God. That was not God. No, just sin. Just give Then they will tell you, "Oh brother, you know what? I was really I was in a fixed but you start to ask you are not willing." It says he pressed upon them. don't go &gt;&gt; because he loved to eat turned unto him and entered into his house. He made them a feast and he did break bread and they did eat. But they were not willing to start fasting. But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of Sodom, compass compassed the house around both old and young all the people from every quarter. These people are the same. All of them old and young from every quarter. He called unto Lot and said unto him, "Were the men which came into the earth, bring them unto us that them, Lord went out at the door unto them and shut the door after him and said, I pray you, brethren, do not sow wickedly. Behold, now I have two daughters which have not known man. Let me I pray you bring them out unto you and do to them as is good in your eyes. Only to these men do nothing. For therefore came they under the shadow and they said stand back the bur. And they said again this pharaoh this one pharaoh This one pharaoh &gt;&gt; came into came into and he will needs to be a judge. Now we will deal worse with thee with than than with them. And they pressed saw upon the man even Lord and came near to break the door. Look the Bible says this one fellow came into. He came he was just a sjanna but he landed in sodom. But we see is way of behavior brother. It was different from the natives of sodomy. It was recognizable that he was just a saranic to the extent that Peter said in second Peter 26. It says &gt;&gt; and turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them with an overthrow making them an example unto those that after should live ungodly. and delivered just Lord vexed with a filthy conversation of the wicked. Lot was so vexed. says, "For that righteous man, dwelling among them dwelling among them in seeing and hearing vex his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds. If sin no longer grieves you, you are under sin. He was so vexed in his righteous soul. But he says in his righteous soul. If there is any righteousness in your soul, [Music] Sin will make you grieve. It will relax your soul. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother, sister, it really doesn't matter where you go, where you are or where you live, whatever it might be, how far you are you are from the church, God still wants to use you. for a testimony that surely there is a power in the blood of the lamb in the message the beginning and ending of the gentile dispensation paragraph 30 the prophet says now we find out that Daniel &gt;&gt; became an instrument in the hand of God while he was away from his own people out of his own city, away from his own church in a strange land. God used him. There are people brother that God can't let you lose because you are going to go astray. The moment he lets you loose, you are going to go astray. But the prophet says sometimes God lets you lose to see who you are. He lets you loose. You know when you have just come to Christ, God holds you in such a way that brother, you are just like over walking in the air. You don't understand. You are just floating through. And there is comes a time he lets you lose and if you go back then that's who you are brother until you are subjected to a test says in a message I believe the god of the evil age it has come to a time but it is hard for a Christian get out of the house because all they are going to see is a filth. But unless you are you go out, you won't know whether you're Christian or not. If you can stand in the midst of wickedness and hold the testimony of the Lord Jesus, our application, he says, God used him out of his own city in in in a strange land away from his own church. Now you can be away from whatever you may be. You can be away from all your loved ones or you can be away from your church. But you can still be an instrument hands of God. God can use you for testimony or anything. that he wishes to you brother that's as real as real can be God has not called you to be a Christian here no brother he has called you to be a Christian out here a Christian at home a Christian as a husband a Christian wife a worker. Whatever it might be, God wants you to be a Christian, anywhere, any place. Look, brother, he was an instrument in the hand of God. A pilgrim is a stranger passing through a certain foreign land. He or she is on the move. He is on the move. He isn't yet where he is going and but he isn't where he started. is just on the move. You may not be where you out to be. I know you know where you want to be. You are not yet what you want to be and you are not what you ought to be but you are not what you used to be. You are on the journey progressing daily. Step one step at a time. Not turning back. Daily progressing towards that final destiny. Look brother, show me a man that will stand and say, "I'm now adopted. Yesterday I was adopted. Have you had any money? Come and say you will come and say brother yesterday at 2 a.m. I received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But not even Paul, not even Peter stood and said yesterday I was adopted because an adopted son or daughter of God always is seeking for higher things. If you are adopted, you are known like that. Remember he says that not as though I had attained. A thou already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend that for which also I am apprehended of Christ. He says, "Brethren, I count not myself to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are before, reaching forth unto the things which are before, I press toward the mark of the price, the calling of God." Brothers and sisters, there is no lower calling, each one of us that has been called has been called for a higher calling in Christ Jesus. Let us therefore as many as be perfect, as many as be adopted, be thus minded. You come from somewhere. You are going somewhere. You if you're pilgrim and a stranger, you know where you came from. You are not walking aimlessly. You are not walking without a purpose. You don't do things just to do things. You do things for a divine purpose. Knowing this one thing, you are just a man, but a man with a divine commission. So you are not walking aimless, but you walk and live with purpose. You are striving. not to entangle yourself &gt;&gt; with the fallen things of the land that you are passing through. &gt;&gt; A pilgrim is always sriving fighting day after day, not to become a part of the things of the land that they are passing through. This world is not my home. I'm just passing through my treasures up above in heaven. Brother, sister, he says, for where your treasure is, there shall your heart be. He says, store up there for treasures in heaven, you are a pilgrim. Look brother in Deuteronomy chapter 12 the Bible says verse 29-32 when the Lord thy God shall cut off the nations from before thee whether thou goest to possess them and thou succeed them and dwellest in their Verse 29. Take heed to thy soul that thou be not snared by the by following them after that they be destroyed from before thee that thou and that thou inquire not after their gods saying how did these nations serve their gods. Even so will I do likewise, thou shalt not do so unto the Lord thy God. For every abomination to the Lord, which he have they done unto their gods, for even their sons and their daughters, burnt in the fire to their gods, what thingsoever I command you, observe to do it, thou shalt not add there in order diminish from God was giving them an instruction and telling them look brother you look here children you are pilgrims and strangers therefore after you have possessed the land don't behave like genetics a pilgrim and a stranger He is under instruction. There is something within them calling for home. There is a voice brother that speaks unto them. He says stand this way. Turn that way. Turn that way. There still voice of God. came within. God demanded them. You know, each one of us the the the voice of God always is speaking. Turn this way, turn that way, turn this way. But there's a lot that we are listening to uncertain sounds that cover the voice of God. God demanded them to remain separated because they were pilgrims and saints. They had a different food. It was mana from heaven. They had different water. It was water from the rock. They had a different leadership. The pill of fire and the pill of the [Music] proved that they were pilgrims and strangers. They had a unique God of unique ways. And that's exactly who we are. We have a different leaders, the pill of fire, the spirit of Christ. We have a different water, the waters of the spirit. Lord, we have a different food. The word of God. Therefore, we have a unique God of unique ways. We can't serve God the way the rest of them serve him. He says serve God with reverence and godly fear. Then he says, "Serve God in a way that's acceptable. God is a spirit. They that worship him must worship him and truth. Brother, we can't serve God in a religious way. We can't serve God in a denominational way. We can't serve God. [Music] We can't serve God like the way the rest of them are doing. We serve God wisdom with the knowledge of the truth. &gt;&gt; You say, "I'm serving. I'm doing all I can. I'm doing all I can. Going here, going there, going here, going there. preaching, preaching here, doing this thing. But are you doing it right, brother sister? It's not about what you do. Not how sincere you are. No. No. No. No. Not how sincere you are. Is it acceptable? And is God pleased? Look brother, you may not do much. You may have too much. You may be so righteous in yourself. But having done all, ask yourself, is God pleased? Look, brother, before was translated, had a testimony that he had pleased the Lord. And we have this confidence that whatever we ask of the Lord, we receive because we do those things that are pleasing. There is no rupture unless you please the Lord. He had this testimony. He was a pilgrim and a stranger. Amen. &gt;&gt; We sing the song. &gt;&gt; Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, pure and holy, right and true with all thanksgiving. I'll be a living sanctuary. It says in 2 Corinthians 6 14, be not equally together with unbelievers. What fellowship as righteousness with unrighteousness? What communion as light with darkness? What concord as Christ with burial? Or what part that believes with an And what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them. I will walk in them and will be in the will be their God. They shall be my people. Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye separate, say the Lord, touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and you will be a father unto you. You shall be my son, says the Lord Almighty. Brother, sister, it's a daily fight. is day by day dying to yourself to your desire to your thinking to your will to do the will of God the life of Christ a life worthy of the gospel brother it says Revelation 18 1-5 after these things I saw another angel coming having great power. And the earth was lightened with his glory. And he cried mighty with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of death and hold of every foul spirit. and a cage of every unclean and hatful body. For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of our fornication and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her. And the merchants of the earth are waxed rich through the abundance of And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her my people. There is a judgment has been passed by an angel from heaven." Then there is another voice from heaven. It says, "Before judgment, sit right, come out of our seat that you be not partakers of and he received not of her bless sister. That's the kind of people that we are called out and separated pilgrims and strangers together with Christ. The world is falling. &gt;&gt; Religions are falling and we are not of this world. We are pilgrims and strangers. We are not a denomination. We are Christians. We have one language, the Bible language, the word of God. We have one culture, the heavenly culture. We have one nature, which is of Christ. We have one leader, the Holy Ghost. We have no love but love. We have no but Christ. We have no book but the Bible. We are not membership here. We have no membership here but fellowship because we are pilgrim taking a city to God. Our spirit is different. The test of this world is rotteness with voodoo to our soul because we have a different spirit. We have the spirit of Christ and the Bible says that here we have no continuing but we seek one to come. Christ himself suffered without the gate. Therefore, let us go to him without reproach. Bearing his reproach, let us go to him, bearing his reproach. For here we have no continuity, but we seek. Look brother, the things of this world are going to be shaken and moved. They are going to pass away. All of them will be shaken. The Bible says, but that which can't be shaken shall remain. And we receive a kingdom that can't be shaken. Therefore, as Christ can't be shaken shone of my beast, I'm not of this world. Say no. Hallelujah. Whether peace, the world is passing away. Whether chaos the world is passing, whether unity, it is still passing, we are not of this world. We are seeking a city to God whose make and build is God. Therefore, we are pilgrims and something in me is longing for I want to go. I'm longing for home. I want to be where fellowship brother. I want to go there where Jesus is the light. It shall be one day without a night there. No sorrow, no weeping, no fears, no sickness, no death. There brother that time. Until that time, we are pilgrims and strangers. Brother, nothing here will continue. No, no, nothing. You come here on the earth. You come naked. Naked came out of my naked shall I return but with your character. You are going to go with what you did, brother. Therefore make right when there is a still time is now rest is now and therefore in the fear of God until that time now you can make it better. The time is now and time is no more. We have lived on the earth until we have forgotten that we are soon moving. Look brother. time now the church of Christ that the bride of Christ gets to a point whereby we stand and say I pledge allegiance to the Lord with all my soul and with all that I am I will seek to honor command I pledge allegiance unto the lamb of God I pledge alleg to the lamb of God. Brother, sister, the world is passing away. Politics is passing away. Education is passing away. &gt;&gt; We need all these things, &gt;&gt; but it's not what we need the most. It is all passing away. If it won't do me any good, help me to serve the Lord. If they want to help me to serve God, I don't need them. Why? Because I know I'm just a pilgrim. [Music] Look, brother, marriages will pass away. It is for the earth, brother. is not eternal. It will go. You have got to understand. If God gives it to you, it just has got to serve a heavenly purpose. If not, then it is of no good all the foods. It is a pleasure to eat &gt;&gt; but it will pass away and to the heavenly to get the heavenly all these foods of the world because they are for this body they will pass away. But I read in the scripture I read in the scripture. I read in the scripture that men ate angels food. [Music] Angels food. Men ate angels. There is food in heaven. Brother. Ah. You don't believe it. I believe it. Because men ate angels food. Physically they ate it and spiritual it is the word but physically there is a supper brother and there is eating and drinking. Oh brother nothing here will continue. It will all give away to something that's eternal. This immortality will give out to immortality. Nothing here can sustain a believer completeness and satisfaction. There is nothing on the earth that can make me desire to stay here today. Listen brother, even if I engage today, I engage today to stay at the next. If it is the rapture, let it come. Brother, it is better. But look brother, [Music] &gt;&gt; there is nothing here. I mean it from my heart. There is nothing here can make me to desire. next day I'm only here because God is purpose my coming here is not yet fully no is not yet fully fulfilled surely but there is nothing here that can stop you from serving God. There is nothing should hold you back. There is nothing between me and my savior. Take the blood of Jesus. Take the blood of Jesus and put a full stop all your bondages. Look brother, if I live a holy life, shine the wrong and do right, I know myself there will make a way. Not only for the things of the world, you will make me aware for me to go out of this earth. There is no sin should overtake you. There is no sin should overtake you. There is no man should hold you into their obedience if they contrary to the Bible. No brother, you are no more slaves to it. So do not go for it. Look, sin is pleasurable. In the beginning, it is such a pleasure. It will make you feel that you are on high in heaven. But you down there below it will sting you an immoral woman. The Bible says her is sweet and slippery. But in the end she will sting like an why is the way to hell. Look brother, don't turn your eyes to that. Keep your eyes on Jesus upon the word of God. I understand I understand that the temptations today are far more than what our fathers receive than what brother received than what the apostles went through. He gives you grace sufficient for the time. When the enemy rises against you like the flood, God raises a stand. He raises a standard for a given age for the people of the age. There is no man, no woman is a standard. The people have a say I used to hear sisters say wife used to dress you mine also you see a picture is not the standard [Music] but the spirit on you what does it tell you know brother Julia starts like does like this brother. The word is the standard. Do what the word is saying. Oh brother, that's the standard. The word stand the test of Jes and prove it. is victorious brother that God is worthy anywhere any place any time and all conditions and circumstances take the word of God the sword of the spirit oh brother it says be sober be vigilant Because you devil moves around like a rolling. It's so sad. We forget brother fighting a spiritual battle. Yes sir. You say brother I fall. I to fall many times but I rise brother. Said brother I feel I can't go anymore. I come to those moments too. You say, "Brother, I don't feel like saved. I don't feel like I'm saved." The prophet says, "I'm not saved." Because I feel I'm saved because a lot of time I don't feel that way. But I'm saved because I did what God said to do. That's all. That's all that I have hope and faith in it. I don't feel it. Sometimes sometimes I feel I'm a rich brother. Sometimes I feel I need serving God and other times I feel I'm a brother. I'm a god or not. Other times I'm cast it out. and I rise. And I say it's my faith. It's my faith. I fulfilled the word. I did what he said to do. Look, brother, sin will sting you and rob you of all your confidence. as a son or daughter of God, it will take it away. You remain a son and daughter of God, but it will sin robs you the confidence. It is so attractive. It looks so nice, so beautiful. But on the inside, it's all packaged with hair. [Music] It will dry your spirit, [Music] silence your testimony. When it gets inside, it will start eating and eating. It will be eating. Look here 137 by the rivers of Babylon. There we sat down. Yeah, we wept. When we remember desired, when we remembered our testimony, but now in captivity because of their sin, he says, "Yeah, we sat down and wept." Look brother, we hanged our hops upon the willows in the midst thereof. [Music] For there they carried us our captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required us nothing saying sing us one of the songs of Zion. But how shall we sing the Lord's song in look brother they could no more stand and sing praises and worship the Lord and glorify the Lord because of captivity but sin let them touch by the rivers of Babylon by the rivers of sin They sat down and wept. Sin will put off the fire in the church, in your life, in your family. It will silence everything. It will cover everything. Brother, sister, sin will take you farther than you want to go. Sin will hold you too long than you want to stay. Sin will cost you more than you are willing to pay. Sin is cruel. If you put condemnation and guilt and makes you feel ashamed, brother, sin, flee all manner of evil. Sin takes away the joy of your soul. It creates a bad atmosphere around you. &gt;&gt; It's always there and someone comes to you. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother. There's something about you that is attractive. It's a spirit of God, a right atmosphere. And when s comes in, it takes away that atmosphere. You start to behave in a certain way that you wouldn't want to be around you is it repel. It repels. &gt;&gt; This has no limit. It has no boundaries. It's not just similarity. This and it's it's all sin, brother. You get entangled in something that will makes you prisoner and we are able to see because the atmosphere around it comes too bad. [Music] &gt;&gt; I always pray and ask God create around me a friendly atmosphere. [Music] Brother, sin eats your spiritual. Remember this whatever they come. This is sin, brother. It's a sin. It's a sin. &gt;&gt; It eats your faith. [Music] It eats your virtue. It eats your knowledge. It takes away your temperance and you temper. [Music] It takes away your patience and you become so impatient. It takes away your godliness and ungodliness comes around you. It takes a brotherly kindness from you. You don't like brotherly. You don't like fellowship. It is a sin. It is a sin. It is a sin. Something around you and you not it in trouble. It is a sin. Work upon it. Work upon it. Don't think I'm like that. I'm like that. Christian is I'm like that. I'm like that. I don't know how you are. I don't agree. I don't agree. I don't agree. There is something wrong about you. An evil spirit surrounded you with the wrong atmosphere. You want to be indifferent. You want to make decisions here and there. This and that. Contrary and that something about you. Work upon it brother. It is your love. It is a sin. It's It hates it. It eats your prayer life. You can pray a sinning man who pray and a praying man will stop but sin eats that love. It eats it away. It takes it away. And when it comes in the church, brother, we don't want it. We don't want it. &gt;&gt; We don't want it. We don't want it. Walk upon it. God be merciful to me. Brother, the other part of it, the other part of sin, it's the consequences. The consequences of sin are far too hard than you can bear. Sin is forgivable. You can be forgiven. But the consequences will remain [Music] some remove all days of your life. Others for a time. M &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And I know always comes last. God can take our sin. God can forgive you of sin. But the consequences he won't reverse. God won't abort your pregnancy because you fornicated. forgiveness because there is another principle the seed has to bring forth. I'm saying you can be forgiven but the consequences you may fight with them for a time sometimes all days of your life. We are called to live above all sin. [Music] controls this world but we are not of this world was talking with his wife and she said honey we haven't seen any Christian woman why don't we dress like them also where we are all Americans And he said, "We are not of this world." &gt;&gt; It's because for us we come from above. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's why we are not like them. A deceived church by the world. But coming to a conclusion, he says, Paragraph 40. Uh, I want to read a quotation here. Amen. &gt;&gt; A man or woman. A man or a woman in Italy, &gt;&gt; in France, &gt;&gt; in Africa, &gt;&gt; in any other nation that's ever born again of the Holy Ghost, don't do those things. Yes, &gt;&gt; they won't wear those clothing. They won't act like that because they are of another whose ruler and maker is God. We are from heaven. The spirit that's within you motivates your life. If you are unamerican, you will do as the Americans do. If you are French, you will do as the French and criticize the other one. But if you are of God, you will do the way they do in heaven. Because your spirit comes from above, it controls you. A little something you might look at in the scripture. Those who sought this new city acted different. They professed that they were pilgrims and slaves. But on the side of they become fugitives and renegades. You know Christians were pilgrims and strangers. A fugitive has no home but a pilgrim. He says a fugitive has no home. A renegade is a horrible person but a pilgrim is something real and from a real land in another nation trying to find his way home. professing by his living that he has something that he is from another country. There is the reason brother. It's not that the world is wrong. No, the world has set its things in the exact way that's right and good for the world. [Music] The way they have prepared this world, this is how it is supposed to be because it is the world. &gt;&gt; So there's nothing wrong with it. But it is that why we condemn the world is and it all looks wrong because we are living in a wrong place. The world is not wrong. It's us in the wrong place brother because we are that is it. &gt;&gt; We are pilgrims and strangers. The world that's the world. We are in a wrong place. The world does look wrong. To us the world is wrong. And to us before to the world we are wrong. And when we look at the world we say they are wrong. They look at us, we say we you are wrong. We tell them the world is wrong. Is because it is a crash two nations. One from above, one from the spiritual. I just want to get a point to finish this. just a little bit. Paragraph 42 says here some time ago down in the south. The Germans or the Dutch brought over the Dutch colonies. brought over to American negroes out of African soil in the southern states for slaves. They became personal property to the slave owner. [Music] They worked at the toils of the day and their scars over them from weeps. [Music] sometimes unkind masters and they were burdened and away from home. Many times they wouldn't want to work and they would make them and force them to work. And on a certain plantation there was a great owner who owned many two or 300 slaves on the great plantation. We would buy and swap slaves. And one day a buyer came and he said I would like to buy from you that certain said, "I have watched him. [Music] He walks straight. He never have to whip him. He's always willing and standing rather to do anything. He seems to be such a gallant person. Perhaps you made him the boss." He said, "No, he's just a slave. Maybe you feed him a little better." And what what makes him act different? Said, "No, it's with the rest of them. What makes him act different?" Here it is. No. I wondered myself what made him with his chin up, chest out, ready, ready any time. Never drop, never mopy that he is the son of the king. Though he is an alien, he is away from home still conducts himself. Knowing this that he's a son of the king, he keeps the morale of the rest of them. [Music] He keeps their morale high that ought to be a Christian. Brother, sister, they were persuaded of something. [Music] They were persuaded of something. They saw the promises. They looked to them a far off and they were persuaded of them and they condemned the world. It's not that you won't do mistakes. You are bound to do mistakes, but you are still a son and daughter. And as long as you have the Holy Spirit, he will set you down and make you to think on your ways. David said, "I thought on my ways. I turned my feet your testimony. God will always make you to think on says in a message it shall be as it was told me. There's many times that I know that I make so many mistakes and I fail in so many things that I am ashamed of myself. But in my heart, I am trying all that I know how. I'm just doing all that I know how. That is confession. He says, "I made many mistakes. Still make them and you will always make them." In a message, law of grace. I made many mistakes. Still make them. We always make them. I didn't want to read you. Read that quotation. Let me read it just says uh law of grace paragraph 135. I made many mistakes to make them. will always make them. But when I make them, the Holy Spirit tells me that it's wrong. Then I repent right there. I say, "Lord, forgive me. I didn't mean to do it. You help me now." And I walk right on. I walk right on the same thing because just no sooner than it goes from my lips. If we confess our sins is just to forgive them. Is that right? The devil say you know that you know what I will tell you. You were supposed to go and do a certain thing you didn't do it. You sinned. I say I confessed it. Don't talk to me about that. You see, &gt;&gt; so he says you will make mistakes. You always will, but the Holy Spirit will tell you touch. How many knows brother Ben? How many believes him to be God's servant? He says that this brother makes many mistakes. But the good thing about him when he makes them, he's always ready to crown them and make it right. A real man of God, they know that they are not infallible, but their confidence is in the infallibility of God. We therefore do not focus on each other's mistakes. or on our own mistakes. My mistakes should never be a stumbling block to you and your mistakes should never be a stumbling block to me. But stepping stones [Music] that that that will help me to get closer to Jesus. We should all look to Jesus and focus on him, the author and the finisher of our faith as we stand on our feet. says in a message my life start now it was given out that today I was to kind of talk to you a while on my life story that's a hard thing for me this will be the first time I have tried to approach it for many and I would do not have time to go in detail but just part of it. Now listen, it says and in here in here in life story. I have made many mistakes. [Music] done many things that was wrong. And I will desire [Music] that you in the radio land and you that are present that you will not take my mistakes to be stumbling stones but stepping stones to bring you closer to the Lord Jesus.
