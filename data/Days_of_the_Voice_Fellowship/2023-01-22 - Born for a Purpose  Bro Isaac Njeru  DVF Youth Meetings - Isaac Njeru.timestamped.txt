[3:38:22] and even now get ready
[3:38:27] friends of it of this is not
[3:38:31] it's not the preachers or the or the
[3:38:34] past or whatever that is making it

[3:39:52] [Music]
[3:40:09] [Music]
[3:40:11] and that means energy together we are
[3:40:14] going to have a second climax
[3:40:18] [Music]
[3:40:21] when brother
[3:40:23] one brother Isaac was beginning to
[3:40:25] minister
[3:40:32] the word Spirit just came on me and
[3:40:35] um
[3:40:39] you were looking at me if you noticed me
[3:40:42] I just took my paper I said my notebook
[3:40:46] and penetration
[3:40:49] [Music]
[3:40:52] and I wrote these words by inspiration
[3:40:57] but before I read them for you
[3:41:00] I want to read a line out of what
[3:41:03] brother Isaac preached
[3:41:07] he said you are the people going to God
[3:41:11] is going to use to fire Kampala again
[3:41:22] Uganda
[3:41:23] that's not a maybe that's the truth
[3:41:28] we are not clearly we are not all the
[3:41:31] youth in Uganda right
[3:41:36] Uganda but there are many more years
[3:41:44] and so that's what they say then the
[3:41:46] other line is
[3:41:49] if you replace this kind of church
[3:41:55] so what do you get
[3:41:57] a religion
[3:41:59] is
[3:42:00] if you replace shouting and uh which
[3:42:04] foreign
[3:42:27] I don't even know the title of the
[3:42:29] sermon he preached
[3:42:31] but that's what the Holy Spirit minister
[3:42:33] to me as he was speaking
[3:42:37] but before that
[3:42:40] these words came to me
[3:42:42] and if it came from the Lord it has
[3:42:45] something where it is
[3:42:52] I don't care about the criticism
[3:42:59] here maybe those who are streaming
[3:43:05] um
[3:43:10] foreign
[3:43:39] brother I called for you because I know
[3:43:42] you would interpret this perfectly
[3:43:46] yeah
[3:43:49] [Music]
[3:43:51] that feel a call of God on their life
[3:43:58] into Ministry
[3:44:03] these words were before brother Isaac
[3:44:05] said
[3:44:10] that he is responsible to the Holy
[3:44:13] Spirit
[3:44:16] and he demonstrated how a man is called
[3:44:18] into Ministry
[3:44:23] the Holy Spirit already said this
[3:44:27] through the preaching he's been teaching
[3:44:30] the young people how you according to
[3:44:31] the Ministries
[3:44:40] call the young men that feel a call of
[3:44:43] God on their life into Ministry
[3:44:49] those that will be a generation of men
[3:44:55] that will be
[3:44:58] that will that will
[3:45:01] I don't even know the handwriting I
[3:45:02] wrote it but I can't even reading
[3:45:08] I have to understand this word you know
[3:45:14] those that will be a generation of men
[3:45:16] that will will have back a backbone
[3:45:29] and to demonstrate this message
[3:45:42] call them to come forward
[3:45:45] and take a stand

[4:22:12] Jesus being Guided by the Holy Spirit
[4:22:14] yes
[4:22:16] he came four days late

[4:22:25] had lost his way and he had ignored them
[4:22:27] and he was left
[4:22:30] [Music]
[4:22:42] but I want to say we are on time
[4:22:49] this is the purpose
[4:22:51] [Music]

[4:23:50] a lot of things
[4:23:55] because of time yeah
[4:23:58] [Music]
[4:24:05] from what I see since
[4:24:09] we've had we've
[4:24:13] [Music]
[4:24:18] from what I have is
[4:24:21] foreign
[4:24:23] [Music]
[4:24:39] [Music]
[4:24:48] and um
[4:24:50] we took Pleasures in our church
[4:24:55] [Music]
[4:25:05] we've collected about 2.2 million
[4:25:09] sentences
[4:25:11] [Music]
[4:25:17] of this morning I believe
[4:25:23] and there were some places from our
[4:25:26] church
[4:25:29] [Music]
[4:25:39] foreign
[4:25:42] [Music]
[4:25:54] [Music]
[4:26:04] [Music]
[4:26:43] so I just said all that to say
[4:26:48] God has almost taken care of of God has
[4:26:52] almost taken care of everything
[4:26:56] [Applause]
[4:26:58] yes
[4:27:02] [Applause]
[4:27:08] yes and so uh I have I see here at
[4:27:12] deficit of about four millions
[4:27:21] and that is of course
[4:27:24] the Brethren from Kenya oh ah okay I
[4:27:29] don't know whether you wanted me to do
[4:27:30] that
[4:27:33] sorry I've already done it but
[4:27:37] I said don't do it
[4:27:41] that is that is not a Kenya million
[4:27:45] Shillings yes
[4:27:48] four million Shillings in Kenya is how
[4:27:50] much percentage
[4:27:56] 120 million Uganda Shillings
[4:28:00] for the Brethren is streaming from Kenya
[4:28:03] please this is not Kenyan shillings
[4:28:09] so this is Uganda shooting there's no
[4:28:12] sense
[4:28:13] Uganda I think it's a little over a
[4:28:15] thousand dollars or something like that
[4:28:16] yes
[4:28:18] and we we have we have our brothers
[4:28:23] visiting
[4:28:30] and listen
[4:28:32] I believe
[4:28:34] we should take care of them also
[4:28:40] so the fans that I'm telling you
[4:28:43] is not
[4:28:45] what is taking care of them
[4:28:49] it is the funds that we needed to take
[4:28:52] care of ourselves
[4:28:57] I think I saw a list of I'll give this
[4:29:01] the afternoons after the afternoon
[4:29:02] service I don't I want to spare the
[4:29:03] details so we can go for lunch and then
[4:29:05] come back
[4:29:10] as of yesterday father two churches
[4:29:12] represented
[4:29:19] and about five pastors have been around
[4:29:23] so this has been to take care of us
[4:29:30] this has the fans I've spoken was about
[4:29:33] taking care of us sentences
[4:29:40] um
[4:29:42] but we we are taking we're going to take
[4:29:46] up an offering
[4:29:49] and this will help us
[4:29:53] it will help us cover that money
[4:29:56] because
[4:29:58] Pastor you have big Faith
[4:30:02] you mean we are going to collect four
[4:30:04] Millions right now
[4:30:08] yes it is
[4:30:12] I know some of you have paid company
[4:30:18] but like I told you that we we had to do
[4:30:21] that
[4:30:23] to make sure we we have something to
[4:30:26] support
[4:30:30] otherwise
[4:30:40] what we wanted you to come we didn't
[4:30:42] want it to be a hindrance
[4:30:53] help us cover that money because
[4:31:00] we want something extra yeah we do that
[4:31:04] maybe in the last service of the last
[4:31:05] service
[4:31:08] so we're going to take an offering this
[4:31:10] morning to help on this together
[4:31:19] we shall go towards our visitors
[4:31:25] to help them on their expenses
[4:31:35] by the way this is the right way
[4:31:37] too he ain't calling into Fair dealing
[4:31:40] with money
[4:31:42] is you pass the collection plate
[4:31:45] will you make the need known
[4:31:48] you make the need known
[4:31:51] you pass the collection place
[4:32:12] then you this one person is robbing the
[4:32:15] blessings of all the others
[4:32:20] some things should change
[4:32:24] we are not going to call brothers from
[4:32:26] Canada and ask them to fight to give us
[4:32:29] food to eat together
[4:32:38] foreign
[4:32:53] why raunchy because I believe it should
[4:32:56] be that way
[4:32:58] we should learn to own our meetings
[4:33:02] [Music]
[4:33:04] if we call a meeting
[4:33:07] we should give
[4:33:10] ourselves
[4:33:11] [Music]
[4:33:21] and I know that in Uganda here many
[4:33:24] times we want to associate white skin
[4:33:25] with money
[4:33:27] Uganda is
[4:33:36] but many he can confirm that many in his
[4:33:41] country
[4:33:43] live on on loans
[4:33:50] houses cars and everything
[4:33:55] they really don't own them
[4:33:59] some of you have funds of three millions
[4:34:10] in Africa we are not only we are not
[4:34:13] really poor us
[4:34:18] to change our mind
[4:34:24] we pass a collection plate
[4:34:27] you give 500 Shillings no way you lose
[4:34:30] return you you you go out to buy a phone
[4:34:34] you spend 2 million no way your medium
[4:34:37] that is hypocrisy
[4:34:40] we should change that attitude
[4:34:43] I think if I was to preach in these
[4:34:45] meetings I would have preached on money
[4:34:49] but you have survived because I will not
[4:34:52] preacher
[4:34:55] so we are going where are the deacons we
[4:34:57] are going to take up an offering
[4:35:01] give abundantly
[4:35:03] and God will bless you abundantly
