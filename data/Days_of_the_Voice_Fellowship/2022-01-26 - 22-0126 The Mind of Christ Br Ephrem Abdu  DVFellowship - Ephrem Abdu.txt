[Music] [Music] before and wait for the priesthood of uganda is passing here today if you're drinking the tea go over down your child you'll leave the tea and make sure you stand and give respect for the president and the king saw his people suffering and [Music] but god told him an instruction that he must sacrifice his son but he says even if he dies the lord is to resurrect him again going i'm going nanda to start to worship christine's with my son no man i want to come back and come here that's the face so in june i want to lay a little of background you know this world all the people have their own system to live life the world has its own way of system to organize their mind [Music] people or ourselves has our way of system doing things you know if you go another country there are their own way of doing things and when you jump to another country they have their own system their own way of doing their own things [Music] will have its own recognition [Music] [Applause] beneficial for what he do for his citizens when we talk about sports there is an olympic game worldwide is an agency olympic he make sure he has separated himself from the family he makes sure he has hired the right coach he makes sure that he's eating the right nutrition [Music] a day he make sure he separate himself and try for that event and when he reached to that point it's not and make sure that this man can have his own fair play now imagine this this man has been separated from his family the player will tell him now you can run and you can win even [Music] [Music] is 55 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways are my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways and my thoughts than your thoughts never think he's going to do it in our way people will plan their own plans and their plan will not be fulfilled because it is not god's plan to speak to the people he will tell them the future you tell them and he warned the people god has said this [Music] to is telling us that rain will not rain forever and this one is telling us rain is going to rain and the world is going to be destroyed and set in the security now how come this man is god using this man if he was the right kind of prophet he will have understand that science has told us the desires will not reign just on god loves his people now he changes for now he comes as using kings he was using prophets now he's using kings through the kings didn't listen to him that he will not if you didn't respect moses and you didn't receive no time to do it he's a disgrace it is a disrespect why right people use their own minds [Applause] message hallelujah he's the last but power but they are relying on their wolves if we see in the map of lodosa in the middle of the cross where was the richest had an opportunity of growing business so that's why the bible calls them they are relaxed didn't use uh samsung his power he didn't take his power saturn he didn't take his strength he didn't attack because they have rejected the message they have rejected the prophet they are stuck they were unable to see the cloud they were allah and move with the clouds jesus christ is going to come and visit us again not to judge come again jesus christ is coming again not to judge yes he's coming again to give us you know mercy objectives the people are so deceived and will make them relax that jesus christ is going to come and heal the sick followers their ice yes they have ice to read the word of god let us have the mind of christ has its own way of making you hate the word of god oh but they can't many technologies there are people who read the bible what happened to my bible there are people who go through every sunday service what do you have until the beginning and present the world to the people never would what do you have about so these are the people that the the people listen to they know that jesus christ is going to come but yes the messiah is going to come because they know in the read of the word of god a very good place for a good palace for the messiah to be born because they read the bible they make sure the virtues are ready [Music] they will say ah the bible is saying king will be born oh [Applause] [Music] you may you will be unable to see the word of god [Applause] read the word of god when you have the five cents aligned with the word of god you will hybrid and confuse the people yeah you will hybrid and confuse the people hallelujah [Music] let me read the scriptures the book of songs 106 106 let me start from verse seven it says have you reached yeah our fathers understood not thy wonders in egypt they remember not the multitude of thy mercies but proved but provoked him at the sea even at the red sea nevertheless he saved them from his name's sake that he might make him mighty power to be known [Music] [Music] for he will take the people and lead you to the promised land god's plan is always perfect always perfect hallelujah but the people misunderstood him again he gave them the signs he gave them the prophet with the message he opened the red sea he gave the man a fresh manner from the heavens he opened the road and gave them a pure water he faced them he protected them [Music] they were unable to see him they were unable to recognize him [Applause] are saying oh this god you're serving you're going out no way because look at the cloud the cloud is telling us you cannot go anywhere the storm is telling i'll drown there is impossible i can go through the storm people using their own knowledge their own understanding and god hallelujah [Music] the lord jesus christ hallelujah even her husband nepal she didn't want his riches she didn't want his inaudible she only need one thing that's a fruit she wants the seed hallelujah hannah is a woman woman represent the church what are we asking the lord misunderstood [Music] not for him to do what are we seeking for today [Music] hallelujah because i like going through the scriptures so we can create i can create a picture david is a servant of the lord david loves the lord david has a future a good plan for the lord we will say and we will understand forest chronicles i would recommend one brother to read for me this first chronicles i'll not take much time first chronicles chapter uh chapter 13. hey yes okay yes and and david [Music] and david consulted with the captains of thousands and hundreds and with every leader and david said unto all the congregation of israel if it seems good unto you and that it be of the lord our god let us send abroad unto our brethren everywhere that are left in the land of israel and with them also to the priests and levites which are in their cities and suburbs that they may gather themselves unto us and let us bring again the ark of our god to us for we inquire so another congregation say that they would do so for the of all the people so david gathered all israel together from sure of egypt even unto the entering of hemath to bring the ark from kiljath jerim and david went up and all israel to back to ba bala that is to kjath jerem which belonged to judah to bring up thence the ark of god the lord that dwelleth between the cherubims whose name is called on it and they carried the ark of god in a new cart out of the house of abinadab and user and a hero drove the card and david and all israel played before god with all their might and with singing and with harps and with south trees and with timbers and with symbols and with trumpets and when they came out to the thrashing floor of of children user put forth his hand to hold the ark for the ox and stumble and the anger of the lord was kindled against us and he smote him because he put his hand to the ark and there he died before god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon us whereof that place is called perez user to this day and david was afraid of god that day saying how shall i bring the ark of god home to me so david brought not the ark of of or the ark home to himself to the city of david but carried it aside into the house of a better or better or bad adam the guitar and the ark of god remained with the family of obedient on in his house three months and the lord blessed the house of obed adam and all that he had hallelujah i want us just to understand david is a faithful servant for the lord [Music] he david is a faithful servant for the lord because he loves the word the word because he loves god he was seeking for atom now is where people go and make a sacrifice what a tome is it a tom i don't know it in english when people uh wants to communicate with the world with god we read in the bible it says and david consulted with a captain of thousands and hundreds and with every leaders one way to summon god will use a messenger [Music] [Music] people use their own their own technology they will search they will search they will make a research and they will try to present god i will try to present this the true way the easiest ways that we can give the people that's why this bible is printed in many languages we have english printed form king james rocking gems but there are many new languages in english language that are printed in english they will say [Music] [Music] you know it could hurt the people so let us make it swift so everybody can read it will not hurt their feelings my bishop never close change her clothes he never wear the same clothes [Music] musicians the best that [Applause] hallelujah [Music] a new fashion comes or some some celebrities create new things people are searching for that will take us back from the word of god he was his father will take him and make a sacrifice with him father make sure that his son is looking and asking for the lord so every time this boy is looking at the father he was also involved with the army i'm telling you outside of the bible you can find it paul was looking at his father the same thing that his father did paul did after christ god [Music] that paul have enough education [Music] he makes sure he have enough wisdom in that wisdom in that knowledge he had no command make him run away from the word of god make him a persecutor of christians the people you're spending most of the time with i'm not talking about them you either bring them to christ or you take them away from christ [Music] way before he deals with the nature he did one thing before he separated the dark from the light yes let's look at samsung samsung samsung samsung let me talk about israel first israel was in the bondage but for god to work with israel if they are still in the bondage they are not called the lord of the house will not be a church okay it will not be called the church demanding you you'll be just like regular joe hallelujah but the moment you don't cut your hair and i was prophesying to someone [Music] it's just like someone running to ellie hearing the girl's voice but don't know what the voice is cheering us somewhere before moses reached 14 years he can tell the people how he came where he came from where they came from he was a different minister he was able to lead the children of israel to the promised land because of the voice not [Applause] [Music] is [Applause] the when people people aren't you have the mind of christ we have a name though we will be different we will walk with a purpose i have christians [Music] these people that came from something dressed very different from the country i will not
