I'd like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Turn to your neighbor and greet them. Tell them God bless you. We are happy to be back in the house of the Lord this morning. And um and I would like to say thank you so much for all those to to all those who prayed for my trip. May the Lord bless you so much because uh he answered your prayers. I've been given a note here. I don't know whether it is this is the friend of brother Billy Paul. &gt;&gt; Where's brother Billy? Billy Patrick. Ah okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. Where is brother Patrick? &gt;&gt; Over here. Please welcome him. &gt;&gt; Brother Billy Paul introduced me to this friend of his for a while. We've been texting back and forth and he has a lot of questions, but he I'm told he desires to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus. Father Billip has done a good job. That's the best you can do for your friend. Introduce the truth to them. Amen. How many enjoyed the meetings? Amen. Hallelujah. I I know it has been a very wonderful weekend uh with with a lot with the conventions and um I want to believe that we are all charged up. Amen. I will know. I will know it as I'm preaching this morning. If you're charged up or not. Amen. Uh this morning, I just want you to receive greetings from brother Polyup. We have internet uh we have internet issues because of power this morning. He told me he would be streaming but I know the stream is not very very good this morning for a while he's been trying to process u you know he came to me one time and he told me you see pastor we there's this opportunity that has come up for me to go and study abroad [Music] I don't know what you think about I just told him if it is study I I think about I I think it is good to to take seize the opportunity and so um you know the the country where he has gone to they are very good with technology I think brother Isaac was telling me that China Pakistan and some other countries the the number one he's going to he's going to study a course in in AI and robotics robotics in Pakistan. &gt;&gt; I have already connected him with the uh believers there for a few years. I've been corresponding with some brothers in Pakistan and so even yesterday we had a video conference with the brother and he was even more than willing to go and pick him up at the airport. The school already had other arrangements. I said first thing he arrives the next day I'll go and meet the brother. I understood there are some brothers from America going down there to have meetings around this this month. So he's going to arrive in meetings and I think I told him it would be a good opportunity. is you know to get to meet new people and it's not a a small course I mean it's a four year course so we are going to miss him uh really so much and I believe that God has sent him there for a purpose amen do you have did you receive the the document I know I did not communicate with you but if you could kindly check up on the media. There's a a document I've sent. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you can get it on the Is the projector working because of the power? Okay, let's try to do this after the service. Just give you a little mission report and a few it doesn't work then we'll do it on Wednesday. Let us stand on our feet and go to the word. I'm still a bit tired in the body. Uh 10 days of uh serious work traveling across the country and the Lord has done a lot. A lot has been accomplished in the realm of the spirit and thank you for your prayers. We are going to the book of Matthew chapter 7. vers 13. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're reading in the name of the Lord. Enter ye in at at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go in there. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. Amen. Amen. Let us pray again. Father Lord, we just want to commit the people now into your hands. Lord, as we are going to share a little bit of your word, may it be a source of encouragement, may may we, Lord, be brought into your mind because we know that you give us your word to for us to uh walk away from our mind that we might receive the mind of Christ. For your word tells us that we should not be conformed to the world, but we should be transformed by the renewing of our mind. We know it's only your word which can do that. Lord, we submit oursel to the same this morning. Help me this morning to speak to get out of the way that Lord I will speak according to your will this morning and anybody and whoever will hear and listen to what we are saying this morning may they be encouraged in the name of our Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. You may be seated please. This morning I'm speaking to you on a a little subject and I wanted to title it the narrow way. But maybe before I get into the word I just remembered there's a brother the first place we went to in Ethiopia um is an older brother. Uh you've heard of his testimony before. I've told it here. This is someone that um you know God really supernaturally provided a a lake for him to be baptized. [Music] How many remember that testimony? Oh, if you remember that is in in in in Ethiopia, northern Ethiopia just about 100 km from the Red Sea. So and uh this brother you know sometimes they stream our services and of course he got to learn that we are having a project land fund project for the church and he contributed uh a sum of in his money 10,000 beer [Music] and so I refused it. I told him I did not come here to collect money. He said, "No, there's no way you can refuse. This one, it's not for you. It's for the work of God." I said, "All right, I will take it." And so I already handed it over to the treasurers and 250,000 shillings in our money. And so that that that goes to our land fund. And u maybe to add on the words that brother Daniel spoke already uh you know we are not going to be shocked if uh one of you gives a million or 2 million or 500,000 300,000 whatever it is within a week because you see you are not you are contributing towards paying your um pledge and I want whatever you pledged target to finish it within six months target to do that. So if you pledged and you are giving nothing which we were reviewing it with the treasurers yesterday we there's quite a long list of brethren who are giving nothing towards their place. Remember the inspiration is you you you pledged and that is you brought an empty vessel and so now begin to pour in oil and that's going to be little by little you see but it will fill up. So don't say don't wait for the big uh breakthrough that you'll get. Actually the big breakthrough will not come if you do not give the little by faith. So give little by little by faith. If 5,000 is all you have or even 2,000, I'm talking now to those of you who are giving nothing or towards your plan. Give 1,000. Give 2,000 because whatever you give it will reduce from your place and also it will show that you have faith because faith without works is Are you alive? Faith without works is dead. So let us be alive. Give something if you have faith. And you're not giving because you have. You are giving because you want to have. Amen. And I believe that the Lord will honor that. Anybody who truly does that by faith Do not stress the team leaders. Some of them you know told me that they were stressed [Music] because you know they will contact the members of their group who are actually members of the church and the ones who are not members of the church will be quicker to respond. It's a shame. Okay. If you know you have nothing on that group at least you encourage your team leader that is giving something. You know when we come here we give offering but some people have nothing to give by coming here by singing by clapping your hand you are giving to the Lord is that amen you are giving what you have it's not only money so please encourage your team leaders encourage them and then they will be able to also do better appreciate God for the brothers that ministered in my absence And also I would like to bring my condolences to sister Rose, some family members for those who stood with her and those who went to uh you know comfort her. God bless you. Amen. I know this is the last uh Sunday for our students. They're going back to school. So I hope I'll remember that we pray for them. the narrow way. Tell your neighbor the narrow way. That's what I'm speaking about this morning. Enter ye in at the straight gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go in their heart. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way. Can you repeat that? Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way. Straight is the gate, and narrow is the way. Narrow is the way. When you have the truth, you would think that everybody will will believe it. There are many places I've preached at And people came up and told me, "Oh, we wish this was preached in a stadium." And what they were meaning is that everybody needs to hear this. You know the message we are preaching, friend is not um for everybody. It is for the elect. At one point in time in the past, I used to believe that my preaching or I should say the preaching of the word. I used to believe that it will change everybody. That is true but not entirely true. It is true because when you hear the preaching of the word, you will not remain the same whether you have believed it or you have refused to believe it. Praise the name of the Lord. You know, you remember the rich young ruler who came to Jesus. He never believed the word. Did he remain the same? What happened? The Bible says he went away sad in his heart because he had so many riches. So I believe the word will not will make you not remain the same. When you hear the word you cannot remain the same. Even you has come here today. You cannot go away the way you came. It is impossible. Amen. When you come in and and you sit under the the preaching of the word, something will happen. You cannot remain the same. Okay. But this word cannot make everybody believe because that is how it was in the beginning. God himself preached the word. Cain never believed. So if God can preach and someone cannot believe, it means there will be people who will never believe. The problem is not that the word has less power. But the problem is in the seed. It's just like the rain when it rains and you you have weed and you have wheat. [Music] Oh, let me say you have maze and then you have uh cocoas. You understand? Those of you who have ever had gardens, this is an interesting revelation. You will have your maze or your beans or wheat and then cocoa bars and other weeds. You never planted those but they grow when you are sleeping. So when you go out into your garden, you find the cocoa, you find all the other types of weeds. So you have to weed them so that your seed that you planted can grow well. But for God, he never allowed for the weeds to be pruned or removed or weeded out. He said, "Let them grow together. So you see they are all going to enjoy the same rain and you know the Bible speaks about the latter rain and the former rain and and you know that means the teaching rain which is the former rain the teaching reign of the word the word rain and the latter rain which is the rain meaning the spirit. So which means that you know rain will come down upon or upon the garden. Follow me closely. The word will come down. The spirit will come down. But what determines what happens to what is in the garden. What will be harvested is not within the rain's capacity. But it is within what is in the garden. So you see you know that what you planted will have will you know come to maturity as long as it receives the rain. But you see at the end of it all you will harvest it and you'll be so happy and you'll take it. But then there will also be the wheats. These ones you never planted them. These ones came on their own. But you know how did they grow? They grew by the same rain. The same rain which matures the seed will mature the tears. So when the word is the tears are growing but the seed is also growing. The tears are growing and the seed is growing. The tears are manifesting and and and and you know the the the good seed is manifesting. And let me tell you, we are at manifestation time. This is a time of manifestation. We must manifest what is in us. Whatever is in you must come out. Amen. If it is seed, it will be seed. If it is, you cannot pretend is in there. When you hear the word, it must come out and we have arrived at that time when people have begun manifesting what is in them. Jesus was with the disciples. for three years and Amen. &gt;&gt; He preached to them. He taught them. They matured. They matured. And one of them at the time of maturity manifested who which color he was and that was Judas. And Jesus said, "The entire call you 12 and one of you a devil. You would wonder, I thought those he called are all part of the bride. Not all he called a part of the bride. Some that he called are not part of the evil. Not all that are called are chosen. Many are called, but few are chosen. Not everybody that calls himself a Christian. And there's only a few that are chosen. And those are the are the ones that will always find a narrow way. The narrow way is not an easy path. The narrow way is the word way. The narrow way is the spirit way. The narrow way is the Bible way. But not all will find that way. Blessed are you. If your eyes see, if your ears hear what the word of God say, that's what it says in the book of Revelation. Blessed is he. Amen. And I want to say I am blessed because I am one of the few. I am walking in a narrow way. But you see today I want to approach this uh in a way that I want to think that everybody will understand. And we are going to use a scripture in the book of Jude. And if you have your Bible, you can open to the book of Jude. Chapter Jude has only one chapter. Jude is just the book before revelation and I hope that today you can get some food. &gt;&gt; You know uh we have we are way past the time of just making you feel good. We want when you a person comes to church you have labor to come you will come and get food spiritual food. Are you ready to eat? Amen. So you must have appetite. Without appetite, you will not enjoy food. But if you have appetite, you're going to enjoy this this morning. &gt;&gt; Jude 8. I want us to look at um we are going to read okay the whole chapter is good but the whole book is good but we will just read um from 8 to 13 and then we talk about it in phases. Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil, he disputed about the body of Moses, dust not bring against him a railing accusation, but just said, "The Lord rebuke thee." But these speak evil of those things which they know not, but what they know naturally as brutal beasts, in those things they corrupt themselves. Woe unto them, for they have gone in the way of Cain, and reign and and reign greedily after the era of Balam for reward, and perished in the gain sayings of Kora. Uh these are spots in your fists of charity when they feast with you, feeding themselves with without fear. Clouds they are without water carried about of winds and trees whose fruit wither and without fruit and twice dead plucked up by the roots and raging waves of the sea forming out of their own shame. Wandering stars to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness forever. Hm. Brother, read it in English. Let the people get those words better. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Fore! Fore!chch! [Music] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. [Music] Now those words are powerful but those words are referring to the people who walk in the uh in the wide gate. You know the ones that walk in the in the broad way, the way that leads to destruction, these are false teachers. Now, the whole book of Jude warns us about false teachers. If you want to know anything that the Bible speaks about false false teachers, go and read the book of Jude. You know, he talks, he warns us about ungodly men. But you see this man creeped into the church and they turned the grace of God into sin denying the Lord. Of course, the Lord we know is the word. Amen. and and vers 11 which we have read here uh we will find that it compares them these men. Please follow me closely. Just just stay you know focused and listen very well cuz I want your soul to be fed. You see these men in verses 11, he compares them to three Old Testament examples. Uh-huh. Read verses 11 again and see it. Why unto them? For they have gone in the way of Cain, and reign greedly after the error of Balam for reward. [Music] and perished in the gain sayings of Kora. [Music] So now here he's talking about three examples in the Old Testament. You know, scripture was given for our example. And here he gives us three examples. And you know, by the way, this is amazing. Jude was a brother to Jesus. [Music] &gt;&gt; You know she was given birth to by Mary. [Music] The same one who gave birth to James. Are you following me? And you know Jude and and some of his brothers never believed in Jesus until he rose again from the dead. And that's why even as he's beginning to write, he is not saying Jud the brother of Jesus, [Music] he had understood. He is to be despised. He is to be despised because he has not got the revelation of who Jesus was. He only knew him after the flesh. But after he knew him as the spirit, then he said, "Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James." So he now knows his place. I'm not even worthy to be called his brother. I am just a servant. But then he begins to warn people about those teachers that teach against Christ. You know, sometimes when you see a person who has no revelation of the truth, don't hate them. Love them as much as you can and show them the truth because when they grab it, they will fight for it with their life. Amen. I was one of them. I was one of them that did not believe this message. I fought against the message. I spoke against the message. But one day when it was revealed to me, oh brother, sister, let me see somebody that is saying something against the message. I will show them what Judy was showing them. I will speak to them without fear and with authority. You know Jesus gave us power. This power is for what? &gt;&gt; Not to fight. This power is to speak the word with authority. Hallelujah. Without fear, without favor of any man. Oh my my. So when you see a person trying to go against the word, have patience with them. And who knows who they might be? The ones that have stood for this word in many generations before us. There were men who fought it. Look at look at Saul who later became Paul and he stood for the word. He preached the word and he said if any man preach different from what let him be cut. That was a man who knew what he was talking about. He said the words we speak to you are not from the man's wisdom which they teach but he said it's from the spirit and that's what we desire. Amen. You need a personal revelation of the word. Now Jude goes and then he goes on to the Old Testament and he pulls out three examples. Remember he's trying to warn us against false teachers. He's trying to warn us against those that teach heresies or those that do not accept to walk in the narrow path. And then he gives us examples of those who refuse to walk the narrow way. And can we go through them this morning? I'm asking you shall we go for the first one he gives us is Cain and you can look up in Genesis 4 we will not go there though because of you see represents a false worship coming to God with his own idea instead of coming to God by re revelation of the sacrif You know, God wants you to come to him wi with go with his revealed sacrifice which is a blood. But Cain could not do that. And those today who go the way of Cain, they choose they choose religion instead of revelation. There are things in my heart I want to say to you, but you will help me to say them to you. Amen. If you don't, then I'll just quit. So, help me preach this morning. Amen. And so, Cain was a man that uh you know went by religion and not revelation. Do do you know the great the worst thing that has ever hit the world? [Music] You know what it is? Religion. [Music] Religion is the worst thing that has ever hit the world. Organized religion. [Music] Denominationalism. Brother Bam said it's a par brotherhood. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; But you know the bride has been liberated from dark religion and denominationalism. And the bride has been given revelation. Never replace revelation by religion. The purpose of the preacher that is inspired by the spirit is to preach you away from religion into Christ. Away from religion into Christ. Away from the church into Christ. We are not preaching our church to you. We are not preaching our religion. We are not preaching ourselves to you. We are nothing. We are preaching to you Christ, the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the church is built upon the revelation of who Christ is. And I want you to see here as the prophet now begins to speak in the message, the God of this evil age. And he preached this in 1965. And I'm going to quote it for you. Very powerful words and they align with what I'm saying. Just listen. He says, "Notice what he will do. His thoughts." He thought God dwelt in in worldly beauty. He did that in heaven. Sin never begin in the Garden of Eden. [Music] It began in heaven. When Lucifer, the son of the morning, exalted himself in beauty and wanted a more beautiful kingdom than that of might. And he thought that God dwelt in beauty and not his Cain. He didn't want no blood sacrifice. He didn't want to make himself dirty with blood all over. You know, blood stinks. Blood, you know, you know, makes you dirty and all that. Cain did not want nothing to make him dirty. He was a very smart boy. He come down and offered the fruit of the fields beauty upon the altar. Very religious. He done everything that just exactly like Abel done. He offered a sacrifice. He fell down before God in worship, obedient in every way, but without a revelation of the word. Doesn't matter how much you do. It doesn't matter what you do for God. God is not looking for people who will do something. God is looking for people who would have a divine revelation of the word. But whatever you do, you do by revelation. You don't do by the crowd. You don't do to be seen. You don't do to be hard. You don't do to be good. But you do what you do because you have a revelation in your heart. And you know you're doing it for the kingdom of God. You see, you know, Cain did everything that Abel did, but at the end of the sacrifice, God told him, I am not happy with your sight because there was no revelation. And the word was from the beginning, God's plan. It was God's plan. But God revealed by revelation the very thing that he vindicated and punctuated that was right. He revealed it by what? By revelation, not religion. Come on now. Not religion. not an altar, not belonging to church, not making a sacrifice, not being sincere, but by revelation of the word of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Someone can belong to a church. Someone can make a sacrifice. Someone can be sincere. Someone can have a religion. Someone can sacrifice on the outside. Pray every day. and still go to hell because they are not doing it by revelation. God does not require an altar. Doesn't require a church. It doesn't require sacrifice or charity, but it requires revelation. God revealing to him what it was. His mother God revealed to Abel. His mother did not take an apple that a snake give her. That's what religion will teach you. And you know, you remember those books which we used to see when we were young. I'm so happy my children will not read them. Putting wrong seed in their mind that a snake came and told talk to Eve. It was in a tree. Have you seen those books before? And it spoke to Eve. Did God say? Have you ever seen a speaking snake? It is not existent. There's no speaking snake. That's lies of religion. Lies of religion. You see, but she had, we now know that she had a sexual affair with a person of Satan in the form of the beast, not a reptile seat, but the most smartest, the most sist. image of man. The only thing that that that the seed would mix. Now science is trying to find him. Science is trying to find that beast. There is a connection between man and animal. Where is that beast? What is the connection? What is the missing link? I can't find it. But you and I by spiritual revelation, God has sent us a prophet with a message. Amen. And he has revealed to us what happened in the beginning. Amen. Amen. Praise God. And they never will find him because every bone in his body changed. But the Bible declares it to be so. Now it is a crawling rectile. Every bone was changed. All the hipbones were changed. All the leg bones were changed. The head bones were changed. And now they can't find him. They can't find the missing link. But the bride knows. [Applause] Nobody can believe this. Only by revelation. If you don't believe it, say, "Well, brother, I don't believe it. It's all right. You have no revelation." When revelation strikes you once, you will jump up and you will say, "I say it now. I see it now. I see it now. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And in a report which I'll share with you, there was a denominational minister that came in one of the meetings we had ina. And he couldn't see it. The second time he couldn't see it. But the last time we met, he said, "I see it now." And he said, "What hindereth me to be baptized?" And I told him, if you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized. And right away, we went to the water and baptized him in the name of the Lord Jesus. I said Jesus is the same yesterday. Hallelujah. Amen. Spiritual revelation of the word. They reject revelation and they take religion. So sad. And brother Bam says here in God rich in mercy they they have run in the way of Cain perishing against sayings of Kora. They are running the way of Kain building altars. These days we have so many altars. Yes. So many altars in many of homes and churches building churches. How many churches do we have today in the world? So many right denominations making it flowery big more members than the rest of them. breaking in things. Anything that comes along and that jumped up and down or shook hands or was baptized in a certain way or spoke in tongues or or run through the floor or they put their name on the book say your members are no special revelation and then turn on the real truth that be preached and they deny How can it be so? That is what a mess we are in now. You see friends, these men, the Bible says they crept in unawares and they would try to replace to replace revelation with religion without us with the church system. Some of these people are sincere. sincere committed brother says they're sincerely wrong. &gt;&gt; Praise God. You see they offer sacrifice. They can even give themselves to be burned. They are faithful to their church. to the altars to their religion. Me one time when a preacher was preaching to me, he was preaching to me water baptism in the name of our Jesus and his name is brother Paul and I told him brother Paul. Uh I the bishop said he can emerge and he asked me a question and this really really moved me. He said brother do you think your bishop with his gown he can go inside the water and immerse you? When he said that, I felt he ridiculed my religion. He ridiculed my church and I was so bitter with him. And that's how it is today. People are so glued to their church to to their religion to to to their church system, to their men of God rather than the work. and messaging believers, we should never get to that level. We should never get there where people will fight on behalf of their pastor. Oh, because my pastor doesn't like you, I don't like you. I saw one time on television when one pastor dragged another to court and the people from that church came, you know, and they were going to court. I know you saw that and and these ones were almost undressing our pastors were even before you were these ones are saying they're Christians and the other saying they're Christians none of them is a Christian I say friends if you have the spirit of Christ in your heart you will know it's not your church it's not your religion it's not your sacrifice it's not your sincerity it is the revelation you have in your heart without Jesus Christ. Praise God. But God is only pleased by revelation, not how faithful you are to your church, not how faithful you are to your pastor, not how faithful you are to the religion or to your altar or how sincere you are. I can tell you I'm so sincere. It doesn't matter how sincere you are. You can be sincere and sincerely wrong. If your revelation does not match God's Bible, then your your your experience is wrong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, God is pleased by revelation. And our faith is a revelation from God. Faith is a revelation. That is why I want to say just for a moment. It's a revelation. He has revealed it to you by his grace. It is nothing you did. You didn't work yourself into it. You you understand you you if you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God and God reveals it to you. Therefore faith is a revelation. Tell your neighbor faith is a revelation brother and the world church of God is built upon the revelation. Open your Bibles to the book of Hebrews chapter 6. 11 6. Praise God. I want you to look at that. It says, "But without faith, it is impossible to please him. Amen. Can we read it together? But without that's that's 1% of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want I'd like us to read it together. One, two, three, go. But without faith, it is impossible to please him. You want to please God, religion won't please you. God me I'm a method. I'm a Pentecost. I'm born again. I'm DVF member. I'm this one. God will say, "Nonsense. I'm not I'm not pleased." But say, "I have faith." He'll begin to smile. What did you say little bride? I have faith. &gt;&gt; You say yes. We are now beginning to talk because remember faith is not something you work yourself into. Faith is a revelation. Amen. Of who Jesus Christ is. For he that cometh to God must believe. that he is and is a reward of them that they seek. So Cain refused to have faith. Kane could not have faith because in his soul there was no seed jam of life. He couldn't believe what God was saying cuz God said if you if you do well will you not be accepted? Cain turned around and he went and killed his brother. Why? Because the Bible says his works were evil and his brother's righteous. &gt;&gt; Brethren, the narrow way needs revelation. Revelation whereby you have a revelation that is all about you. It's all about Jesus, nothing about me, nothing about my accomplishment, nothing about Jesus. &gt;&gt; And in the message, we are not building a system of religion. Am I preaching to believers? We are not building system. We are building the body of Christ. by spiritual revelation. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; By spiritual revelation, not by church identity. See, but by spiritual revelation, not by religious identity, not by how sincere they are, but by revelation. And now Jude warners of the way of Cain. And I've just told you today the way of Kain. May we never go in the way of Kane. The way of Kane is a way of organization. He's a way of denomination. He's a way of religion. He's a way of of all those sacrifice and what have you. But no spiritual revelation of God. God is pleased by revelation. Have you seen that part? If you have seen it, say amen. Now let's talk about another way that he actually also warned us of the way of Balam. &gt;&gt; If you want to read it, you'll find it in Numbers 224. He represents greed. Actually today I cannot finish Balam. Even even Kane I just took a little piece. I can preach on the way of Kane as a series for several months because there are many scriptures many many even same thing but let's see what we shall cover today. So he represents greed and compromise. He's a prophet who loved the reward and tried to c Israel. Those who follow Balam are preachers who sell the word for money and popularity. Revelation 2:14. Let us read that. But I have a few things against thee because thou hast them there them that hold the doctrine of Balac. Who taught Balac to cast a stumbling block before the children of Israel to eat things sacrificed unto idols and to commit fornication. Praise God. There is if you have a church age book there is a whole lot of almost a chapter sub chapter that brother banam talks about balam and the pagan church age. So allow me to read for you a fraction out of it but as I read just say amen to the world. Now if we are going to understand what the doctrine of balum is in the New Testament, we had better get back and see what it is in the Old Testament and we apply to the third age and then bring it up to the present. So we are not going to do all that because of time but we just I'm going to give you a little summary so you can understand how the spirit of Balam operated. Now the story is found in numbers chapters 22-2. Now we know that Israel was the chosen people of God. They were the Pentecostals of their day. They had taken refuge under the blood. They had all been baptized in the Red Sea. And they came up out of the water singing in the spirit, dancing under the energy of the Holy Ghost. While Miriam the prophetess played her tambourine. Well, after a certain time of journey, these children of Israel came to Moab. Now you remember those of you who are good Bible readers that Moab was actually the son of Lot. You remember how Lot begat Mo? You remember when they were going out of uh of um you know Sodom and the fires were coming down and the speed the angels told them go run don't look back. You you remember that and then they started running out of the city of Sodom and then there were Lord his two daughters and the wife of Lord and as they were running Lord's wife looked back and you know they told them don't look back but they should look back because of the love of the things that were getting destroyed. Brother, if God calls you out of the world, run and don't look back. Some of you want to look back to the things you came out of. Look back. If you came out of something by the grace of God, I want to give you an instruction this morning. Do not look back. Tell your neighbor, don't look back, brother. Don't look back, sister. Come on now. Amen. But Lord looked back. Lot wife looked back. And when she did, the Bible says she became a pillar of salt. And right there, they began moving, Lord, and the two daughters. And the Bible says they gave him alcohol and he became drunk because they fell. They are going to be all by themselves. and they will die without children. There was nobody to marry them. Sister, never be desperate. If you daughter of Abraham, never behave like the daughter of Lot. Daughter of Abraham knows one thing that all that is mine shall come. It's only a matter of time. It's only a matter of time. Amen. Abraham's daughter. Allow me to preach to you this morning. And I want you to say, "Amen. Your husband is coming. [Music] God cannot allow me to say it if there was nobody who needed it. And God can't allow me to say it if it was not the right time for it." Say amen and believe it. Amen. But you see these ones were not patient enough and they gave their father alcohol and they used him to get children. And now Moab was one of those boys that was born out of that act. And now Israel lady baptized in the Holy Ghost. Bam says she was a type of the church because she was baptized through the Red Sea and you know they came out singing in the spirit dancing with the energy of the Holy Ghost and Miriam the prophet was playing a tambourine. They were so happy. They were shining. And then they reached the land of Mo, &gt;&gt; the land of people that were born out of immorality. But remember, they had a natural connection with Abraham. because Lot was Abraham's cousin rather nephew. So, Israel were related with Moabit. I want you to see that. Amen. So, you know, your Moabites are not entirely people you don't know. Amen. Stay away from the Moabites. Whenever you get to them, ask them for one thing. Don't ask them to connive and correlate with you, but ask them for one thing. Give way. Let me pass through. Let me pass through my revival. And the Bible says we are here on earth as we are going somewhere. All the people around us. They are the moabites. We know them. We are born among them. We related to them. They don't belong with us. We have another covenant. We are the covenant people. We are going in the rapture. We are waiting for the body change. We cannot come here. Let us go through Some of you your moabitete is the body. Tell your flesh. Come on little more, let me through. Let me through. Let me &gt;&gt; I don't belong here. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere to a land that is so beautiful that flow with milk and honey where my promise is. And I'm giving the honest of the spirit. That's why I'm dancing. That's why I'm shouting. Why? Because I'm Holy Ghost of God. Amen. And you know they were going through. And the Moabites knew the truth whether they lived up to it or not. When Israel came to the to the borders of Moab and they sent messengers to the king of Moab, they said to them like this, "We are brothers, let us pass through your land. If our people or our animals eat or drink anything while we are going through, we will gladly pay for it. But King Balac who was the king of the Moabites was got very excited. The head of that Nickelon bunch, that head rather, that head king, that head of that that Nickelon bunch was not about to let the church come through with its signs and wonders and diverse manifestations of the Holy Ghost, with their faces shining with the glory of God. That's why I believe, listen church, listen. I believe a true genuine believer of this message filled with the Holy Ghost can never be a Nicholant. [Music] Never never agree with anybody who will call another brother a Nicholant. Nicholant are Moabites. because they don't have the word, they don't have the Holy Ghost. Therefore, they cannot control the people by the word and the Holy Ghost. So, the only thing they have is their own regulations and laws and church and systems and we are delivered from that. We are on the rapture expresses are shining with the glory. We have them wonders, signs and miracles. If the devil doubts that I am a wonder every day I leave is a miracle. Hallelujah. Because the devil thought I would have been dead. So brother Bam says that Nicolant head said no too spiritual I can't allow them to be near my people. It was too risky and he might lose some of his crowd. Hallelujah. Amen. Just like somebody who would tell you, "Oh, there's a convention here. Don't go there. Why? Why? Why? Why?" &gt;&gt; He's fearing something. &gt;&gt; But you know what I believe? If what I have is what you have, if I make a convention, let your people come. If you make a convention, let my people come. If you have what they want, they'll join you. No problem. But if I have what I want, if I have what they have, they will come. You understand? Who's are they anyway? They are for the Lord. Amen. I want to show you how denominations work. The narrow way is against denomination. We are not afraid. You know the Pentecost will tell the people don't go to those people they have a demon in them. The demon is called and then they mention the name of a prophet and they say go among them that demon will catch you and you will stop believing the trinity and you will stop believing. You know in our denomination you stop believing in women you will stop you know putting on makeup and you know you will throw away your trouser if you have been looking as a beautiful girl so you demon will catch you don't go to those what are they afraid of if that is a demon I wanted to catch me I wanted to catch Because anything which will take me back to the Bible, I don't care what it is. God say the way that is called heresy worship by the God of my father. I wanted to catch me. What are they afraid of? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; What are they afraid of? M &gt;&gt; let me tell you friends I am I love this message so much because we have been liberated. We have been set free. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are moving by the power of the Holy Ghost. The power of the Holy Ghost is like a magnet. It will pull everybody. It will pull everybody that was predestinated to life. Where will they where will he pull them to? Not to join a system or church, but to join the Holy Ghost move. But you see this man Balac was afraid. He said, "Your people may this thing might attract me." In fact, so great was his fear of them that he went to an prophet called Bal and I asked and asked him to mediate between him and God and petition the Almighty to c Israel and render them important. Oh my, this one turns me on right now. Hallelujah. See, the devil wanted to render them impotent. If Israel was a spiritual church today, if it was a Pentecostal church today, then that's the same thing the devil wants from us to us. He wants to c us. He wants to render us impotent. Can you imagine? We defy the devil and all his armies. It cannot happen. The devil wants to render you impotent. He wants to to make you useless. You make business, it falls down. You get a job, it doesn't work out. And then you begin to feel maybe I'm cursed. Maybe if you are by the hearing of this word today, you are being loosed. None of you can be cast. None of you can be useless. Why? Because you are in the Holy Ghost camp. You are moving by the leadership of the spirit. You are led by a man of God. Who is it? The spirit of God today leading us to the promised land. and Balam being eager to take part in political affairs and become a great man. So he was only too glad to do so. Those kind of preachers who are very cheap, they will do anything for something. Listen, preacher man, if you've been called by God, always obey God. Now, let me tell you, and I preach to you as as as my local church. I will never go anywhere or do anything in the name of the Lord that God never sent me to do. The day I reach that point, I should quit preaching. I believe with all my heart that a God minister must never serve for money, never suffer for something is promised to you. But you must do what you're doing because you have a calling because you have an assignment. You are led by God. And let me tell you, the way of God is the narrow way. It is not pleasant. It will be you will be persecuted. Many things will happen to you. But you know what? It is a good way. It will be a successful way. The way of the word, brother, will never be defeated. The way of the word, sister, is a perfect way. It is not easy. It is painful. But everybody who got through that way, the Holy Ghost will be with them because he promised. He said, "I will be with you and I will be in you. I will lead you." That's what we believe because the narrow way is the right way. But Balam wanted power. He wanted to be political and great. and seeing that he had to approach to and receive an audience from God to get the people cars. So he wanted to go to God and see if he can get the permission to go. Now isn't just that like the Nikolans we have with us today everyone that go want to go their way. You are leaving this church. I c you. They may not even say it like that. But they may say the blessing of God is not with you. Your blessing has remained in this church because you have left. You know you nicolant spirit. Bam said they will cast everyone that won't go in their way. You see that's the spirit. You have to understand that when asked God for permission to go. God turned him down. Let me go and cast these people. God said no. [Music] The devil wanted to cast you but God said no. No man can cast you because you are anointed. Do something for me. Amen. Touch your head. You know faith without works is dead. Touch your head and say nothing can no one can cast me because I am blessed because I'm anointed. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; No one can cast it because we are blessed. We are anointed. We are inspired by our God who is the original life. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. My my God turned him down. But Balac insisted promising him even even greater rewards than join us and do for me this I will give you this. They say every man has a price. Someone will tell you I remember this brother here, &gt;&gt; brother Brian. &gt;&gt; Some man came to him that was a real true balac. He came told him the way I see you and the way you know how to speak the word. A great man of God. Come I will give you this. I'll give you this. I'll give you this. That was a Nigerian person said I'm going to give you this and I'm going to give you this. I'm going to give you and you will become big and great. Show him pictures. You see how big our name is? You are going to become big. Wherever you are, they don't know who you are. They put you. Thank God that our brother Brian skipped that. The devil wanted to make him prophet Balam. You know, every believer of this message knows a lot. That's the truth. Praise God. And so Balam was given a lot of things. And and then now one answer from God should have been enough. But Balam went back to ask God. God said no. But the way these things I if I can get 50 million &gt;&gt; million. Okay. I know it is not right but let me ask God again. Maybe he will accept so I can be blessed also because he said we shall be heads and not heads. After all is also going to do the work of God. Even if I'm in the denomination and some musicians are in the bal anointing you find them going to the wrong altars altars. You know, when you play music, it's not about you playing for God. It's about which altar you're playing on and which vision you are pushing. You remember in the Bible there was a man, the king Nebuchadnezzar, you know, he had a wrong vision. It wasn't of God, but he had good musician. I don't know where he got them from. Perhaps some of them might have been Jews. They sold out. They and he told the people when you hear music, I don't know the symbols and the drums and the piano whatever the drums and everything then you bow. You know, God uses music and the devil copied that. You know music brings an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Music. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so they started they all bow and some brothers we are standing they said this anointing is not ours. Okay we are warning you one more time. Okay, there's a way we don't play drums. By the way, there are things we don't play because we are inspired different. We don't play about entertainment. We don't play to entertain. Yes, we play to worship. But you say again, one more time. [Music] Everybody bow, you know. And then they refused to bow because they realized that anointing was not there. What am I talking about? Musicians play at an altar. They are worshiping the God of that altar. So friends, you know, don't go the way of Balam. Don't go the way of Balam. Someone said, "What about a preacher being invited to the Pentecost denomination?" That's different because Elijah went to the altar that was sacrificed to give to Bal. But he went to restore the altar. So the preacher goes with to restore those anchors. So when I'm invited to the Catholic church, I will go and I will go to preach the message of you get the point. So there's a difference. Praise God. Amen. And now I'm realizing my time is first spent. Let me just about 15 minutes and then I I'll I'll cut it and maybe continue. All right. But now, okay, are you still with me now? Now, one answer from God should have been enough. But not for selfwilled. When God saw his perversity, he told him to go to get up and go. You see these people who are saying me I'm a woman preacher I was going when God told me to go what do you expect? You went on the on the prayer mountain for 40 minutes and night and you prayed. God saw your perversity and said okay go. But that was permissive will perfect will always agree with the world. Quickly he saddled the donkey and away he went. He should have realized that this was simply God's permissive will and he wouldn't be able to cast them if he went 20 times and tried 20 times. Now like people today they believe in three gods. They get baptized in three titles instead of the name. And yet God will send a spirit upon them as he did unto Palum. And they will go on believing that they are exactly right. And here they are actually perfect balammites. See they don't know. Go ahead anyway. do it your way. Then you say, "Well, God has blessed us. It must be all right. I know he has blessed you. I don't deny that. But it's the same organizational route that Balam took. It's defiance to God's word. It's a false teaching." And friends, we have to be liberated. and be freed and never come in contact with this way of it is real. It's a way of denominationalism. It's a way of perversity. It's a way of the permissive will not is not the narrow way. But the narrow way is the way of the world. Look, I've not even taken half of what I wanted to say, but let us stand up on our feet. If you want more, you can just come on Wednesday. Praise God. Narrow way. May God help us to walk in a narrow. There's a song by inspiration I got some years ago. Brother Shem, I don't I think you know it. You've played it before. I'd like to sing that little chorus. I don't know if the brother you have the words. Uh we've sung it here before. I'm not sure. And I wrote it down. I was in Aasa at the time. I think about six years ago. Amen. Give me truth, mercy, and love. so that I may dwell in your praise. Give me truth, mercy, and love. I'll begin with the first time and I will sing it. Maybe you can listen first and then you can join in afterwards. Oh my life with truth everywhere. I need a [Music] Give me truth, mercy, and life. Lord, the narrow way to walk every day. Give me truth. Give me truth. Mercy and love. [Music] Give me truth, mercy and love so that I may dwell in your presence. Keep me true. Mercy and love. Sing it again. Let me give you truth. Oh, give me truth, [Music] mercy, and love. Tell him as a prayer now. Give me truth. Oh mercy and love so that I so that I may dwell in your praisees be true. Let us try to sing one more time the chorus. Give me truth. Give me truth. I see. Give me truth. Give me mercy and love. So that I may in your praisees me. [Music] Now listen to this song. all my life with truth everywhere. I need a change, dear Lord, to walk in your way. Give me truth, mercy, and grace. Praise the Lord the narrow way to walk every day. Let's sing the chorus one more time. Give me, give me, oh mercy and love. Hallelujah. Tell him now as a prayer. Oh give me truth. Give me your mercy and so that I may I may be through mercy and love. [Music] Everybody shalom can come and help. Let us sing. Lead me Lord and I'll follow. Lead me Lord and I'll call. You have called me and I will answer. Lead me Lord I will go. May may may God help us that we will follow his leadership into the narrow way. The narrow way, the wide way, that one will never fade you. [Music] lead me [Music] and I will go you [Music] will I will lead me I will go. Come on everybody now. I will leave me. I will die. Heat. Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. I will go with every head bow, every eye closed. I want to invite those who are going to go back to school to come and stop every day. [Music] Everyone in reverence. [Music] Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Just stand right here. Let us pray. Everybody bow your head and pray for them. Our loving Jesus, even as we've been talking about leadership into your into your narrow way, for you said in your word, my way is not your way. My thoughts are not your way that is a perfect way. That is the narrow way. Lord, even as these uh children go back to school, I want to commit them into some way young and are going to be commuting from home. Others are young but are going to go to some hostages and others are older and I commit each of them into Lord. May you lead them. The Holy Spirit go with them. We know there are many uh there's another god, a god of this evil age that rules over this world. But may you preserve them. May you encumber around them with the Holy Ghost. May you keep them away from evil spirits. May they come back home when they were spiritually sound and your name shall be glorified. I also pray that you'll give them wisdom, Lord, knowledge, father, bind every force of evil, might come to attack them in any way that they may not excel in their school. That's the wrong spirit of nobody will come and try to make them useless in the name of Jesus that they will go and become useful. I will go in the name of the Lord Lord in the name of Jesus. Amen. And father we pray even for brother Father Lord who is at this present time in Qatar Lord I know he might be streaming this pray as he's going to school father for an extended period of time Lord it's a new place new but may you give him grace deserving father let your angel always be with him father and may you oh God turn him into a real man of God. Stand up to the challenges of your life as into the foreign land. We thank you father as we ask your blessing upon you in the name of Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. You may go back. Brother Marvin, do we do we are we ready? No. No. Okay. So, God bless your church. I'll invite the song leader. Uh I will share with you probably the Lord willing the report on Wednesday and so that you can be able to know what the Lord is doing and also I want you to remember the youth meetings in um we we have already started the preparations sit down and take a take and um I I I know a few may not be here for for the meeting but uh maybe next Saturday we can have the one first general meeting for for those preparations. [Music] Please do so. &gt;&gt; And I'd like to request those because brother Isaac was where's where's brother Isaac? &gt;&gt; Come and give us a report. &gt;&gt; But he spoke and um mentioned that the elders I will handle them but I'm requesting the elders also to give their pledges to him please so that we can consolidate everything. in one fundraising effort. So let him come and give us a report so far how far we are regarding the preparations and the fundraising for the year and then afterwards we shall have the song that dismiss us with a song. [Music] God bless you. God richly bless you. Um I'm just going to take uh just a few minutes uh not more than five. So uh I would love to thank you first uh for the contributions and those who pledged uh uh God richly uh bless you. So uh we are having um first of all uh if anyone that pledged and has not yet joined the WhatsApp group uh kindly uh request brother Dixon to add you uh in one way or the other. he can send you the link or you give him your number or if you want to join uh the group that we created that group is uh voluntary not that everyone should join so if you are not willing to contribute um kindly don't be there it's only for people who prayed for this cause so um another reminder is we had another list I'm not going to read it here uh for the people who had to think about it before giving a prayer. So for those people kindly uh before we leave today uh I'm going to approach you but if I don't kindly approach me or and oh brother Daniel so that we can record your pledge that is the youth if you are the member of this church and and you didn't preach because giving is compulsory for you. So um we have not recorded uh for today but uh briefly here is the report. Okay. [Music] So uh the total amount pledged uh was uh 12 million so far 12 12,960,000 So I think we can clap for ourselves for that. [Music] Okay. So so far uh the amount that we have paid it is um 859,000. [Music] So um that leaves us with a balance of uh about uh still around 12 million. So kindly let's have that cleared. Uh but so far we need to to pay uh the deposit to the venue uh which is likely to be not less than 3 million. So uh let us join our hands this week and uh give so that we shall have it cleared in the course of the week. Otherwise uh thank you so much. God bless you. God bless you. We had there's quite a number of of people going to be coming from other countries to come and and be a part of this um youth camp. Um I've not yet confirmed with the brothers but I heard that could be more than 60 coming from Kenya most likely more than 70 because that the ones that I'm telling you are from Nairobi but I've not talked about western Kenya and the other places where they usually come from so we would not want to have all those people come and we've not prepared for them. Let us prepare for them. Let us be serious with this. This is our vision and it's it's working because it it is being a blessing not only to those people who come in the in the camp but also to us as a church and and also to our young people here you and also in the country. So let us try to do our best to give towards that. Um, if you want to be blessed in the work of your hands, usually when you see something come up as in the line of serving God, be in that. G, give as much as you can give and the Lord will always bless you. There's no shame on me telling you that because that's the way of God. It's the way of the word. Amen. And to those of you who pledged to the land fund, please, like I said in the beginning, try to always every week get something every week. And whatever else that is big that you are planning to get, you will get and also you bring. But for now, before you get the big blessing, give the little that you have. Don't let leave all your pledge to remain there. It's like the the widow woman bringing her um vessels and and the prophet tells her begin powering in oil. And she says the oil is little. It will not finish. She said no, begin powering. Just obey and do what you're told to do and see what God will do. Amen. Um, Sister Rose, I've been told she wants to say something. Uh, we can have a come. [Music] I'm standing here to thank God and to thank the brethren. I thank God for the gift of life. The life I've gone through in the couple of days before has not been easy. [Music] Problems, big problems have come and have been mightier than my life. But above all, I thank God for the brethren that have stood with me that I have gone through those problems. They have not been easy because we lost all our parents. So we are the only elderly people remaining. So whatever happens at home, I need to be there. Our first brother who died, he just died abruptly without getting sick. They brought him on a motorcycle and they were telling the mother that find out whether this person is still alive because all our fathers died. We only have mothers. He got a little bit sick when they took him to the hospital. They sent him to the main hospital in Chiboga. But as reaching the hospital, he just died off. So they didn't know what to do. They said, "Let us go to the mother and find out whether he's really dead or he's still living." Mother just had two motorcycles standing in the courtyard and he was saying, "Come and check this one. We don't know. Truly truly he was dead." So we buried him. Within the same moment there was a ceremony which was prepared. It was for my sister she was going to have intro I think marriage ceremony. So they had told us to come over. So that Saturday morning we went over. [Music] because we were returning in the night. Then we got news about the death of our other brother. [Music] Most of my related brothers had news that don't switch off your phones. This person is really very ill. I was coming to church. I had almost reached N. I saw a message &gt;&gt; that Captain Michael had died. &gt;&gt; As I reached agenda, my daughter-in-law called me with when she was really crying bitterly. Mommy, my brother's died even without getting sick. At the same time we were burying in Chiboga last week this same woman they were also burying another relative. We were we are in funeral also in funeral. It was really very difficult for me as an elderly person and I did not know even where to go. But I thank God's grace when I informed the brethren here. There some brethren who gave me some money. [Music] I managed to go to Mago where the casket was sorry where the body was. I learned something very great that amidst this life we are in death. [Music] We went with brother Peter. He went with me. [Music] The person never got sick. But he just said I can't believe I I feel I cannot breathe. I feel I cannot breathe. And then he died off. And they just took to the hospital a dead body. to check exactly what what really caused the death. [Music] He said that he got three clothes in the heart. He was 35 years old. Brethren, if we are born again, let us repent and walk right because amidst this life, we are under death. That same day I was in the hospital. Then my brothers called me that we make an appointment to meet. We heading to Lugazi. So we went to Lugazi. We all went with one car as brethren. I went there to find out the barrier area. I was with my other brother who is a doctor. We moved two kilometers and reached. We left that place at at 7. By the time we reached where we had parked our car, I had left my car at the funeral place. [Music] That is when I realized that my brothers had left me off. [Music] I didn't see the car. I didn't know how to go back. It was around 7 in the night. That is the first time I saw us sitting in a family car. Three people in front. [Music] We reached Masana at 10 in the night. They told me that we have done what we have done managed to do. That was the first day I used the border for a long journey and even at night but I reached safely. I really thank God. I thank God for the brethren who managed to come and stand with me. &gt;&gt; Brother Peter Mund was there. Sister Esther, &gt;&gt; Sister Esther, &gt;&gt; Sister Agatha, &gt;&gt; Sister Agatha, &gt;&gt; I really thank God for those brethren. God bless you. I thank God for that. More than I I really I I am really I really don't be be very strong in such moments, but I really I feel a little weak. But I thank God. that I'm leaving and I'm I'm [Music] continue praying for me because even from here I'm heading to the village. We have also another bario ceremony today. Amen. God bless you. God bless you so much who stood with her. God bless you so much in Africa. Our life expectancy is a bit low lower than other countries. and someone begins to go 50 and above. You know, a lot of people begin to die around you because they're your age. But we want to thank God especially there's something that she said. If we are believers, we should be genuine. Your life is not in your hands. time it goes. How are you with the Lord? Is it fake or genuine? At that time when you have left this body, there's no turning back. So while you have the opportunity, live the right way and you will have no regrets. So God bless you. Um brother uh Patrick who wants to be baptized will meet you afterwards. I think also brother Peter where's brother told me is that person here today also not around okay okay so there was another person shalom come and dismiss us in a song let us meet on Wednesday you can return to your neighbor [Music] sheep with Jesus and fellowship sheep divine.
