greetings from Brother Andrew uh he he texted me this morning told you to be sure to greet the church as you all know brother Andrew is in Moro and we just uh uh keep him in prayers and we have here uh T from sister bcka I thought is a wonderful Testament it's close to what I shared with you last time it's a goodness of the Lord she said Shalom Saints of the most high God I just can't hesitate to thank my God for saving me from a nasty accident yesterday the motor bike on which I was I was run was run by and crashed and rolled under the failed trctor yeah and then roll under from up and the hilly from Up and Down The Hil slope and I really can't figure out how I escaped but it was just the unfailing hand of God that Lifted Me from the the cycle to the after side of the road you know the the hand of God lifted up from the motorcycle to the other side of the and then the motorcycle was run over Hallelujah it was a very frightening sight that I pray God to erase from my mind may his wonderful name be praised forever and that is Sister amen and to see her here this morning I believe it's the grace of God Amen we should give another clap to the Lord amen praise the Lord the Lord our God is good and he knows how to take care of us amen yesterday uh my family and I was at past Pastor Steven and's anniversary his wife and his wife and himself of them they made 44 years in marriage amen I I I had to tell you that because we have many young couples here so you need to know that you still have a long way ahead and you should build don't give up so and uh uh I told him that thank you for inspiring Our Generation so we were there together with inspiring notm my brother find the the best words oh no not enticing INSP I I think it is encouraging yeah our generation those are the things that we should look at and desire we should not look at what we see on social Med those things we should not desire the SL Queens we see them we should not desire the you know those kind of uh couples that people are desing out there are married four five times someone is 50 years and is bringing a girl of 20 saying and everybody is commenting oh and you are also commenting that's not our kind of role models we believe you you should get married and stay with your partner until death do and if death does not do you part then the Rapture will you will go together so it was a wonderful experience my wife and I were but Pastor Steven looked at us myself and my wife she looked at he looked at us and asked how many years now we said 11 he said so you have 3 years I think 30 something so I so uh but I think my wife we are determined to make it amen amen amen we are time to go praise the Lord I think at this time we can stand and go to the word and while we are doing that maybe just to make a few remarks as well understanding on the church land fun we we have um some brethren that uh uh that pledged to give towards the generator and as well as I think the generator costed more than 2 million I don't remember and um 2.4 Brother Martin can I have the exact figure is okay okay what do you remember I'm I'm sorry I I I'm putting him on spot I did not ask him to prepare the the figure for us so uh also there the flow the initial amount of money we spent so about 2.4 million so this amount we are taken from the land fund you noticed this this time Sunday the brother did not announce the overall amount because I I told him not to because I don't want our expectations to raise because last Sunday he announced we had 60 million but this is not true because some of these things were not subtracted because it was pledged and not paid so and it was not subtracted from the overall and so uh I think we we should announce it we should announce the overall total after all those expenses kindly friends Whoever has made a pledge please uh make your pledge good because we we want to keep going is that understood amen may God bless you as you fulfilled the I think this week they will contact you individually you forgot so they can remind all right I think that's all the singing will do thank you musicians uh we are going to theonomy 28 vers 11 up to vers 12 just read two verses and then get seated let us first ask God to to help us once again Lord we come before you re humbly knowing we have no power within ourselves we are even insufficient in our may you lead us and Inspire us as we speak to your children for these are the purches of your blood may use us this morning that we shall speak the mind of God Grant it Lord in Jesus name amen and the Lord shall make thee plenteous in Goods in the fruits of thy body and in the fruit of thy CLE and in the fruit of the ground in the land which the Lord swear unto thy fathers to give thee 12 the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto Thy Thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow I would like us um those of you with English Bibles to read it together and um so that you can say it on your mouth as well vers 12 1 2 3 start the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thine hand and thou shalt lend unto many nations and thou shalt not borrow we believe that can we say amen amen you may be seated this is um something that U the Holy Spirit led me to share with you this morning brother Fred I'm happy to see you lost bless youcome amen and I'm sharing with you this morning on the subject of building something from nothing [Music] I'd like to see the married people to raise up their hand if you're married okay you are all standing seated a little far but thank you thank you okay now uh and also there others who are soon getting married and by the way I I think like we prophesied in the beginning of the year and by by the way it's not us who make these things maybe someone may think that Pastor does much making he calls this one and tells him praise you ready and sister you are ready please get married this is spontaneously done by God we don't believe in in those kind of match making God is the greatest match maker and when the time is right he accomplishes the thing amen we are only there to support what God is doing and so like I said this year is plent of weddings so once the the one of sister p is done there are others that are coming from this church yes from this amen and not just one more than one so I'm praying that you don't get tired to support the young people especially those of you are older don't get tired we are building something building something from nothing I would like you to pray for me I've um I've been quite busy and little sleep so uh I'm not saying I'm sleepy right now what I'm saying is when that happens the body is tired so if you pray for me I'll get out of my body and the Holy Spirit will come and take that's my desire I always look at when I'm going to share something and then as soon as I connect with him it's like a it's like uh you connect your your phone to a charger from that moment it's no longer me talking I'm just connected to a and then you know it keeps on moving for as much for as long as your phone needs charging is isn't that what we need this morning so you should be praying for me in your heart now that the Lord will surely take me out of the way that he will use me this morning for all our benefit building something from nothing building something from nothing those words came to me and um I was wondering what is it about and then the Holy Spirit began speaking to me to show me how he does his work that God is God and God is by himself where did God come from God came from wherever he came from but no one made God if you go to the Book of Genesis chapter one The Bible does says something very significant he says in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth but it does not tell us what was there before this verse but I can tell you what was there he was he was God already he had by the time Genesis 1:1 came God was God but our Prophet told us that there was a time God was not God are you following me you know there was a time he was the self-existent one existing with all his attributes and he had not created anything but God means object of worship so that means something that is worship that's why in one of the laws it says Thou shalt have no other gods beside me meaning you will not worship anything else apart from me so he needs worship and that's why we came to worship him this morning so we worship him we love him beyond anything else and so now there was a time he wasn't worshiped at all because there was nothing to worship him so when did he become God when he created angels and now Angels began to worship him saying holy holy unto the Lord and they worship him both day and night they are always in his presence every day of course there is no time there it's eternity so from eternity to Eternity they worship him and so by the time he created man or by the time even the beginning started as we know it he was God but how about if we go behind before he became God who was he he was Elohim he was the spirit that gives life and he exist ex existed with all his attributes but you see when he started building okay this is not not about him we are not talking about him today we are talking about his work so when he started now building he started building things are you following me he started building things but these things he was building he was not building them using any raw material I don't know whether you understand the magnitude of that when he was building he did not need any raw material to build his word was RA material you know when you are building a child you need a seed and you need the egg and a child comes out when you need a bottle you need to have some ingredients some raw materials that you will use to build the B when you need a house you will need Stone you will need sand you need cement you need many things the one who built this microphone he needed many things and then to put it together and then build it the one who built the phone he could not build it from nothing he build it from something but do you know that all the builders physically speaking have been building from what already is in existence so God is the only Creator who could create or and can create something from nothing and so everybody else is creating things making things out of something that God had already previously created so they're building out of God's creation but I'm speaking this morning amen about a people that are living on Earth today that can actually create and build something from literally nothing amen is that even possible it is possible amen because these people will have to be like God himself and will be able to create and build something from nothing amen we have an example in our generation his name is William Bram William Bram had an experience of building something from nothing amen praise the name of the Lord as he was out there in the forest and he was a hunter so he was hunting for the whole day and he used to like squirrels and he couldn't find any and so he hunted and hunted and he gave up but then you know the presence of God came and as he talked to him he said just how many do you want just speak it say it and it will happen he am I you know I want three where do you want them are you are you say something here this man was connected with God it was the oh my God it was the right season it was the right time it was the right person it was the program of God there's a lot of things I want you to see and then God told him when all these things that have spoken all the five musts as we shall see it here it must be his time I'm going ahead of myself but it's okay it must be his season it must be according to his word it must be the the person he has chosen to do it by and it must be God's program all those things are true true you are going to be connected to God to the extent you can actually literally hear from you will no longer speak like how people are saying that something spoke to me you will know God spoke to me and he told me to go and start a compy there is something where I'm going you see and so now here we see that God spoke to him and told him where do you want them God wasn't standing there with him but he was connected to him and he was hearing his voice and he was speaking back oh my mind and then he said where do you want them he said I want one here before he even said here it was already there the first squir said a squid he shot it it had blood it was a real squ it was a real living creature and this squid was never in mother's womb it was never born by any other squ it came from literally nothing something from nothing and again he said where another one where I want it here and there was a squir we are not talking about a fe it's not just a story this is not a fiction movie these things happen we know the day the time the year it is history it happened and he created another one there and another one there how many squirel three squirel he shot each of them with his gun and each of them uh you know was shedding blood to show you it was a real living and he cared them and went home to Mex and these squirel were living things and they were created out of literally nothing by someone who was in his right season to hear the voice of God hallelujah and at the same time I did not prepare this to read it for you I wish I had then he gave this testimony to Sister Sister right and sister right had this testimony how God created the squirrel from nothing and she said brother Bram that is nothing but the truth and the prophet said she said the right words and the moment she said those right words amen God came down again the right season the right way the right time then he said okay since you believe sister ask anything you want you shall have it now if she had asked for $1 million it would have appeared right now do you know what I'm talking about do you know the power we power we have and right there she had a desire she had a need that was bothering her for a long time she had three stubbled sons amen I don't remember I think there was three of them and so then at that moment she said I want my children safe hallelujah amen I want my children saved and one by one amen after she had said those words came bouncing there falling down crying and giving their life to Jesus Hallelujah did you know you can give life to something that is dead did you know you can give life to your body you know you can give life to someone someone who doesn't want to serve God maybe your children maybe your relative maybe your father your mother your uncle someone who says I leave those things of God did you know you can literally create something the life which is not there and you can speak it into existence amen you have that power and authority amen when you feel that you cannot serve God do you know you can be like RAB and create yourself that life creating building something from nothing and that sister had all as children give their life to Jesus Christ and at another time brother bam was on a bank of somewhere also a river and then he saw this fish it was dead dead it was already lying there on the and God spoke to him you can give it life and he came down and touched it and said little fishy I give you back your life and in the moment did like this and went into the do you think this is a story it is documented it happened you talk about prophets today in our generation there is no man that had a Ministry like that of William Bram why because he was the last Elijah the last Gentile generation but the things we saw in his life and Ministry is the same thing too we must experience because we are under the same anointing we are under the same calling we we are not elijas but we are the people whose Hearts have been restored and we under that same anointing of we have that power within us because of the revealed word of God you know I'm trying to show you the power of the word that's why for us they call us Bible Believers because for us we just eat the word but you see this word we are eating it's not just you know we not enjoying it in our mind after enjoying it in our mind that our spirit goes into our hearts and formulates another nature in us the nature of Jesus Christ amen and and then you have another life in your life to the extent you can also be like Jesus and you can literally create things amen you see things that are going wrong and you can create from nothing the problem we have many young people and even older ones in this end time they don't want to do something from nothing we want big things but we want it on a silver plate we want big things someone will tell you I feel I should do a business and and they tell them why are you not doing it said because I have no Capital you don't need Capital to start a business economics will tell you you need Capital but that's the economics of this world don't say I'm I'm going crazy to this morning because I'm on another pH this morning you don't need Capital to start a business you need to hear from somewhere you need to hear another sound you need to hear a different sound when everybody else is hearing the sound of capital you you are hearing the sound amen from another real like one time Peter he had another sound amen as you know they were looking for taxes you know God you know just simply spoke to him he said Peter all you have known is to fish so just go and fish you don't need to do a lot of fishing just go and fish one fish the very first fish you will take out you will just open its mouth and there will be money now I want to ask you a question where did that money come from did it come from the bank of Caesar and you know it had Cesar's face on it it looked like it came from the bank of Cesar but actually it was not from Cesar's Bank it was from the bank of Heaven I want to raise your faith this morning to show you we can do the impossibilities we are the people that are called to do Greater Works we the church in the end time that is supposed to manifest the power of the world we must live above our weaknesses and P open that fish and when he looked inside there was money brother Joel there was money inside and he picked that money and he could F that money and he paid tax with that money what are you talking about all the other brothers were very busy preaching while brother Peter was exercising creating something from they did not understand that all the other brothers because Jesus told him go open the fish of the MTH of the fish remove the money and pay your tax our taxes your taxes you the disciples and also mind so where were all the others they were very busy preaching doing the work of God why they were doing the work of God God was already using one brother to create something from nothing which will benefit all of them when you have one son of God who has realized who she is or who he is then everyone else is going to be benefited by the outcome of that amen what do we have in this little congregation this morning I am bigger than I am because I'm seeing things bigger than I am see and allow me to speak prophetic things this morning what do you see here this morning what do I see you know I see CEOs CEO what do I see this morning you see I I I see people here that are going to do many businesses I see many people here where are you getting those things from I'm getting them from another room I'm seeing people here that are going to get married and raise great big family which will be an example to this generation before the coming of the Lord what do I see I see people that are going to work in big organizations and influence a lot of [Music] things are you talking about message Believers message Believers what do you see I see men and women who are going to live above sin to an extent that there will be an example to the others who are living in sin and they will show them there is a better life there is a better life While others are gropping in alcohol I see people who can live above alcohol while others are swimming in immorality this morning I am looking at people amen that I will see living about immorality all these things as I'm preaching to you now I am seeing them I am seeing them I am seeing them I see people oh now this one just came right now I just saw that right now oh my God I'm just enjoying this anointing now I am seeing some people who are going to get real big jobs that's not all that did not even have the qualifications for them is that possible I don't know I've seen it God is able to do exceedingly abundantly beyond what we think beyond what we can ask for beyond your qualification oh hallelujah hallelujah you may have gone many years and you can't even go back to school and you think you your is done but what I've seen this morning that it's not about your paper when the season is right when the time is right something is coming from nothing something from nothing Hallelujah am that's what I see as I speak to you this morning glory to God oh my one time in Ethiopia you know that this sister yodit and she has she was faithful to the Lord for very many uh months and interpreting for us wherever we went and time came when she broke down she she just came to me she said pastor I've given everything that I know how to but I have no job I have no income even the little I was doing as gone I'm now suffering what am I going to do and she was in my office and she was crying and she was crying Oh Glory to God I feel the Pres right now and at that moment you know I did not know what to do talk about creating something from nothing her family was almost rejected they rejected her no one could help her but that moment you know you know the Holy Spirit spoke to me and told me where exactly to go and I began reading for out of the Book of Ezekiel amen can these Dry Bones live again I said sister can these Dry Bones live again do you believe that actually God can do this for you do you believe that the God who put flesh that dry bone the God who brought life amen and S to to that flesh and he brought that life into those bodies and there were dry bones in a valley out of the valley they became a mighty Army it does not matter women how dead they were it does not matter how impossible it was it does not matter how nothing it looked What mattered was The God Who can create something from nothing was right there with the prophet Ezekiel and he asked him Prophet eel can this Dry Bones leave again and the prophet said Lord thou knowest he said now listen to me son of man prophesy to this prophesied to this born and he prophesied and when he prophesied you know there came a mighty we move of the Holy Ghost you know and something happened to those bones flesh Came Upon him Came Upon him that was the first level that was the first SP I'm showing you what happens when something is being made or built from nothing it happen supernaturally you you cannot control it you cannot determine it it is Supernatural you can't even stop it when the time is right when the season is right and at that moment you know the prophet God spoke again to the prophet and he said Son of Man prophesy again the pro problem with us Believers we don't like to prophesy we always speak defeat we always speak failures and that's why we see nothing because we are nothing and nothingness has covered our face our mind we can't see beyond this nothing I am poor I am from a poor background listen I saw someone right I don't want to be the backround that my son will say I'm from a poor backround no I am not a poor background of anyone did you get it amen when you say from a poor backround it means your father was poor but I don't want to be anyone's poor background no I refuse that today I refuse that the moment I believe stop confessing negative things I'm from a poor background I have no money I have no education I can't even have children I can't even get married I think I'm ugly you are prophesying those things over yourself and it will be but today God is giving another opportunity to undo the bad [Applause] prophecies when everybody is saying businesses are not working things have changed economics is bad people have no money we can't sell anymore for you a business person who is a Believer you will have another connection your word will be different customers are coming son of man prophesy to the bones can these bones live again Hallelujah and the man son of man prophesied again how did he prophesy I don't know but I believe it was something like this you bones you are going to become a mighty Army you Bor you are going to be a mighty Army great man you're going to rise whoever might have seen him might have said his man he's crazy he has no education and he's saying he's going to be great greatness stops at 40 if you f and you're not great you will never be great again if you thir and you're not married forget about it that is another story for us we are in another kingdom and this kingdom is telling us we have the power to create something from nothing and at that moment the son of man the prophet prophesied hallelujah amen and he he created flesh and then when he prophesied again life came into this B and they rose up there were great men they were great women and they became a mighty invisible and after the Holy Spirit led me to that scripture years ago to the sister as I was speaking with her and I said let us pray and as I held her hands and as I was praying friends let me tell the holy spirit is real we are not talking about a dead God let me REM my physical hotness but another one hallelujah hallelujah at that moment I realized the holy spirit is real and as I was praying with her I noticed my the atmosphere had changed there was a great atmosphere there the move of God came down the presence of God came down and and words began to just come out of my mouth like a bullet would come out of a g and in the middle of the prayer right in the middle of the prayer said thus say the Lord you are going to get a job it's going to be a big job from a big company you will determine how much you after that I was like what what what just happened what just happened but I realized I had prophesied but I knew if it is a prophecy it's not my mind it's the mind of Christ and at that moment I told her sister wait before you go this was the mind of God not mine I gave a disclaimer there I said I said if it doesn't happen then me I will repent but God will make sure it happens if it is his word how long I told her I do not know but I told her as God spoke to you it not be long even as he has said and at that moment she left rejoicing and happy but do you know what happened two weeks two weeks 14 days Brother 14 days that sister came walking into my office saying pastor I've been given this uh interview there's a brother from some from another country was connecting to Believers here and they were looking for someone in the uh in the in this in the uh banking sector and she must have at least all they must have a degree as a minimum educational requirement and then at least some three four five years experience and they must have good aary skills in English and so this sister had none of those requirement she didn't even have a diploma she didn't even have a certificate the only thing she had was the English she knew and she learned when she was in Dubai and so here she was using that same English to serve God by interpreting for us from English to her local language she was our first interpreter in Ethiopia and as and so she I told her sister why has it come to you now because all the other candidates did not pass the ones who had the qualifications and so they have now told me to try I said sister don't even doubt it's not going to be trying it will happen and and one day I remember she came rushing into my office she said pastor can you help me I'm trying to find something here about the Bing sect I'm trying to make some research how do I do that I just went on Google and and emailed her the information she needed so she went for the interview Brethren something from nothing brother do you believe what I'm saying that sister will come here and testify and they they called the first interview they were so happy they didn't even ask her about education because her English was so good that they were so impressed they forgot about education immediately they told her welcome to the board welcome on board they said welcome and they they they asked her on the second interview how much would you like to ear she spoke the biggest amount she could possibly think of they told done which company a big company a big financial company like Western Union I don't want to and they G gave her that job as a country representative all the money they sent all over the world eia went through half no qualification no certificate no diploma no degree all she had was the god who gave her the word of Prophecy all she had was the word of Prophecy amen the vision which had written down and when the time was right when season was right amen God was there to make good everything he had said and that sister God created a job for her build from nothing amen and she became very happy she became very happy she was one of the rich sisters in church whenever we are doing contri we have to wait what she will first give and then everybody can give praise the Lord praise the Lord what am I saying that same God is here with us this morning that same God is making you a CEO amen that same God is giving you a job if you're jobless that same Goden is giving you a husband is giving you a wife that same God is building your business from nothing to something these are not Idol words I am inspired this morning to

will make you plenteous in the fruit of your body in the fruit of th cattle he will make you plenteous you ought to say Amen to that in the fruit of your ground in the land which the Lord swore unto thy fathers to give you the Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure [Applause] we need to stop receiving the word like Catholics stop making cathol when God brings such things it is his season to work it is not that every time we preach like this when the Lord PR there is something going on if you say am like a cath it will like that I receive it Lord shall open unto thee his good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto your land amen rain means blessing and God says will open Heaven am to your land in his season not your season his season and I prophesy today today is his season for you it is his season for you Hallelujah if there is not peace in your family it is his season for you for God to bring peace for God to bring love and joy it is his season for you to bless the work of your heart while you are building he's going to bless the work of your heart while you're building Oh Glory to God the building I'm talking about here is not the physical building I'm talking about the spiritual building amen because the Believers we build our spiritually but it manifests physically we build our spiritually when you build your wife spiritually you begin to build her oh God this is the kind of wife I want she she must be like this and this and this and this and this you you don't speak by your mind amen you speak in Prayer by The anointing of the Holy Spirit and once you buil her then you just see her being made manifest amen it's not you or people that give children it's God that gives children you can literally build your children you can build happiness in your home you can build amen money where there's poverty where there's no cloes you can build cloes there your marriage it may not be so nice but you can build it over again and to those of you who are just married you need to build your home the Bible says a foolish woman PLS her house with her own hands down she breaks it but a wise woman builds a house we are all the bride of Christ so we have a house we have a family we have a life we are trying to build and we are building it in the spirit when Peter went down to that fish you think he was going to build with his intellect he was going to build according to the word of God and when he opened the fish he removed the money did the money come from God built it that's the kind of building I'm talking about he will bless the work of your hand the problem many of us don't want to build we want things that are finished how many are ready to build when eel was in the valley eel was building he prophesied the first time prophesied the second time he didn't get tired he didn't say God is not true he tired waiting for the season of God wait wait let me give you perspective here now trying to do God a service without it being his will I want to show you now the the the the foundations of of this building this is burning in my Bon you must be in his time you must be in his time it must be in his season you got that now must be in his time it must be in his season time and season and it must be according to his word you can't say oh God I build myself a second wife no it won't happen it must be according to his word amen amen word that he has spoken amen amen spoken word I don't know how many got that written word but it must be according to his spoken word how many got that this written word when you read it with Revelation it becomes a r it becomes a spoken word I'm speaking to you now even the things I'm speaking preaching to you today others are hearing many words but when it is your season you will hear one specific word and God that is mine now that is God spoken word I don't care how well you say this ought to be all that ought to be all this ought to be is got to be according to his word according to his time and his season and it must be given according to the person he has chosen to do it by it must be according to his word according to his time according to his program are you hearing and it must be by the person he has chose to give it to you to do it Moses tried to run from it but Moses was the man that God had chosen God couldn't take anybody else but God chose Moses to do it many of them Paul tried to get away from it but it's got to be by the one he chooses to do it I have a vision something that is going to happen amen and God has chosen me to do it and it must be me to accomplish it that is how it should be in your life I have a vision God has said this must happen and it's going to happen by me are you hearing God gave a vision of Uganda you know that how many believe that I'm not a politician so make no but I'm speaking reality he gave the vision of Uganda and Uganda was going through a lot of political things a lot of insecurity a lot of many things and the man got a vision of how the country should be and that it should be by him that's why he decided to go to the bush and become a rebel many others have become Rebels and they were killed but the man was not killed because he believed in his vision and now for more than 30 years he has been ruling UGA as his vision how much more us who have a spiritual Kingdom amen my life is not going in Zig I am here to fulfill a prophetic Vision Hallelujah I see a vision of where I am going I see a vision of why I am here amen and I know what I'm going to accomplish in life I can see it I don't know how many can see it many people fail in life because they have no vision of their life but this morning I'm instructing you by the authority of the Holy Spirit receive a vision for your life where God wants you to go what you must accomplish amen when you set your heart to it it shall be it shall be nothing can fail nothing can fail why because we have a god that is beyond what we see we have a god that is beyond ourselves we have a vision and this Vision listen can actually be accomplished from nothing are you hearing me from Hallelujah brother Dan just received his vision let me tell you this a supernatural thing you have to look beyond what you see you have to look beyond what man sees amen amen Oh Glory to God my sister looking right at you the Holy Spirit brought me right to you let me come and proph to you now hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah look my sister God is giving you your vision for your life look beyond what you see it's not about what the devil it's about the second phase God is taking you into right now the vision for your husband whatever is giving you for your husband I give it to you right now in the name of of Jesus Christ whatever Vision he gives you God can create something from nothing you don't see anything but that's our God he specializes in things man cannot do he specializes in things thought impossible he's a god of possibilities are you hearing he is a god of possibilities hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen you must be in his time it must be his season it must be according to his word it must be the person he has chosen to do it back it must be the person he has chosen to do it by glory to God it must be according to his program God is program not your program forget about your program God is program God has a program and God makes his known his program by the word of Prophecy it's not a man prophesying to you it is God speaking to you God spoke to brother can this fish live again yeah God give it life where was a man there it was God speaking his and prophesying over him what is going to happen nothing could stop it and this morning I want to give you an example amen of Mary praise the name of the Lord amen it was God's time for Mary to bring forth a son it was the right season after Elizabeth had already got child it was the word of God by the prophets before and it had to be Mary the Virgin not anybody else it had to be Mary the virgin it was God's program also ministered by an Angelic visitation not a denominational arrangement we have a program of God in this end time it is given to us by an Angelic visitation by a prophet of Our Generation amen hallelujah amen Mali 45 amen behold I send you Elijah theh before the coming of the Dreadful devil Elijah the prophet has come it is the program of God by Elijah the prophet all the Mysteries would be finished after they are all finished What Becomes of us we take that word and when we take that word we become it and therefore we have the same Authority that Jesus when he said let there be Genesis let there be all the prophets in the New Testament we prophesying like this very verily no they are saying thus sayith the Lord th say the Lord but when Jesus came on the SE very sayto you who are you I'm the Son of God I'm the image of God so that's why he say that so who are we belov now are we the sons of now we are the image of God we have the same Authority we have the same authority to create something from nothing something from nothing and here comes Jesus when they called him to go and pray for Lazarus when the man was sick Jesus did not go he said there is still some life if I come and I pray for him they would say he just the man was just not but Jesus waited and then Lazarus died Jesus waited he said he's not yet rotten if I go they will say after all he was not dead they bued him and Jesus did not go he said I will wait for 3 Days to finish so he can Ro properly so when I go there will know I can create something from nothing Hallelujah and when he reached there do you know what he did Brother they said the man already stink Jesus was just smiling inside as a man he began crying as a man as a man you will cry because of the around you but he that is in you is greater than he that is in the world your vision will show you what can happen don't know I don't have enough words to bring it listen there is a vision in us and that vision is greater than us God will show you you're going to accomplish in life God will show you what you're going to accomplish hallelujah amen but when you see when you see it will be Beyond you you feel you can't accomplish it is beyond you you feel you can't accompl but what is that Vision that vision is from God and Jesus in him he knew in knew I am the resurrection I'm the life but in his flesh he started crying right he cried because he was weak in the but in the spirit he had seen a vision amen he had seen a vision of what was was going and right there he told them after he cried okay humanity is now [Music] over let God step told R away the St he's sing he said roll away you I am the resurrection and the life roll away the stor Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today where is it today where is it today is in you that today is talking about you is in you the Holy Spirit the hope of your glory hallelujah amen he the same he does the same thing he does the same work he builds life again from scratch and then he spoke out with a loud sound he said Lazarus come forth brother bam said if he did not call Lazarus dead would rise from their Gra but because he called Lazarus only Lazarus came out listen brother listen sister what was there amen there were maggots there was a strange what was there there was death but brother something was happening God is doing the same thing come on deons come and and help them God is doing something come help amen God is doing the same thing right here creating life come on just listen to what I'm saying help them help them look at what I'm saying come on God is doing the same thing what was there was change was dead but God come on church God can do the same thing for you there was death but God was right there God was right there and in that moment when he said Lazarus that sister had a name don't worry about her had a name you may hear your name too if you are in a dead situation he your name too come forth and as soon as that name was spoken as soon as that name was amen whatever Lazarus was life was created not only spiritually even physically the body which was Decay mot disappear magot disappeared the body which was the smell disappeared I'm talking beond what was it God creating something out of nothing and right there as he called Lazarus Lazarus came out jumping jumping jumping what was he he was something he was something out of nothing created by the mouth of God jumping because he was bound because he was bound that is the same God who can rearrange yourselves in your body it doesn't matter what sickness he can rearrange he can rearrange he can rearrange the same God who can take you out of a life of sin and rearrange your life it's the same God who touched Lazarus and as Lazarus came out he was still bound but I took another word hallelujah hallelujah he said lose him and let him go God is losing someone here [Applause] today God is losing someone here Satan has no Authority Satan has no Authority the life of sin has no Authority sin has no when God has spoken when God has spoken sin has no Authority L has no Authority has no Authority when God has spoken lose him and let him go and right there I want to say poverty has no Authority hallelujah amen no situation that becomes permanent in that situation in that atmosphere no situation brother oh I build and they I build

hallelujah right now he's building he's building you know let me tell you when someone is slay in the H ghost God is building something in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] he said the Lord shall open unto thee he good treasure the heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season and to bless all the work of thy heart and thou sh land unto the many nations and you shall not borrow when the time for Mary came oh my if you have you can hear you hear if others can't hear they will [Music] stre when the time for Mary came something was going to be built by Mary from nothing are you hearing sister when the time for you has come something is going to be butiful when the time for Mary came something was going to be built something in her was going to be buil from nothing someone's Time Has Come Today listen I believe someone's Time Has Come Today and God wants to build something from you out of nothing [Applause] [Music] and when the time came for Mary the Lord open his good treasure unto Mary all the treasures of Heaven it was right in the womb of Mary when your time has come God opens your treasure and all the Treasure of Heaven comes down in you I want you to imagine all the Treasure of Heaven comes down in your womb from nothing to something Mary had nothing in her womb Mary was a virgin but all the Treasure of Heaven came down in the womb ofy praise the name of the Lord All The Treasure of heaven heaven had no choice but to give the rain her womb because it was God season all Heaven had no reason to refuse how womb to receive the rain of God's blessing you get that all Heaven had no choice your womb might have been unfruitful and many things you Tred to do not work out everything you start fails but I'm telling you this morning God can build something and when God has spoken amen am no man can unspe it everything Mary now did was blessed he said you bless the work of your heart you will build what is it it's God's blessing that comes by the spoken word of God friends these are the kind of services we need when God comes down and vindicates it to you personally I believe he has more he wants to Vis and I wanted to listen to me heaven has no choice to give it rain when is time your womb will become fruitful if you have a neighbor you can talk to tell them your womb will become fruitful your wom will become fruitful your womb will become your womb will become you can take it as a word of Prophecy for you and everything Mary now did was blessed God is blessing you today in Luke 1:39 just so and listen if you can and Mary arose in those days and went into the Hill Country with h into a city of Judah and entered into the house of Zacharias and saluted Elizabeth and it came to pass that when Elizabeth had the salutation of Mary and and the Babe leaped in her and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Ghost and she spake out with a loud voice and said blessed thou Mar among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb and when is this to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me for L as soon as the voice of thy salutation sounded in my ears the bab leaped in my and blessed is she that believe blessed is she that believes there is something I want you to see here praise the name of the Lord hallelujah hallelujah Mary AR Rose and went to this place and she entered into the house of Zacharias you remember Zacharias had refused to here amen when the time of God had come zakarias was touching zakarias was touching he was touching he did not hear what God was saying zakaras was B in his unbelief and God made that down when it is the time for your visitation and don't believe it God makes you Dum thank God for anyone who would receive their visitation we should never be offended when God visit somebody we are Pentecostals we believe in the Pentecostal blessing of God these words I'm speaking to you Jesus say they are life and zakarias was offended and and and God made him dumb and and and Mary's time for Harvest station had come and Elizabeth 2 had been Vis so one time Mary decided to visit Elizabeth and she had Mary greet her why something had happened in the womb of Mary was the blessing of God was something which was created from nothing there is something I'm trying to say when you visit or when you talk or when you relate with people who have received some Supernatural visitation it becomes contagious hallelujah amen that's why we should look at our friend we should look at our Associates the people we spend time with have they had this phenomenal happen in their life oh they are still living in Canal but if you know what I know and if you fail what I fail then this gospel will mean something to you and when you speak to people they will stop and listen to what you have to say and what are saying will change people and Mary was no longer a common something Supernatural something from nothing had been created in her and then Mary Oh Glory to God Amen that's why this brother had Revelation it's not about shaking of a hand of a preer he's trying to connect to what is that's what Mary had amen when Mary received something and she quickly went to Elizabeth hello Elizabeth just her words just and in a moment Elizabeth Elizabeth received the holy spirit amen I read in the Bible one place where the Bible says Peter was still speaking these words and the Holy Ghost Came Upon them is Bible Hallelujah he still the same God and so right we see here amen Elizabeth received the Holy Ghost and was filled with the Holy Spirit and she testified that while Elizabeth sorry while Mary spoke to her even the child began leaping oh my God I don't know whether someone hallelujah amen when someone who has re who has built something from comes and begins to talk to you amen woman has been activated so your womb too Amen brother Ian your womb too comes activated in Mary's womb there was life in the womb of Elizabeth life came there to amen hallelujah what is your womb today I'm talking about a womb of your vision what do you see for your life if it is not activated my sister God will activate it too is the same God he does the same work he's the same God he does the same it's inactive God activates what what connection was there it was was not personal it was not even family related or something it was something Supernatural Hallelujah you think all these people are receiving something personal no something is happening for it's a something Supernatural when it comes upon you it's beyond noral Mary was just there she didn't say let me go and shake her up spoke words Propel the Holy Spirit the moment that moment she was filled with the Holy Spirit and at the same time amen at the same time Elizabeth's baby who was like wom was dead John in the womb of Elizabeth John was the vision of Elizabeth and her vision was dead for a very long time but the moment she heard from a person who was activated she too was activated not only that but even our vision from within was activated imagine a child in your womb receiving the Holy Ghost can God still do those things can God still do those it is in the Bible [Applause] you know God can actually make you prophesy life over your child who is still in the stomach where the womb was dead God can activate it and after that activation life comes out what happened there God was testifying elizabethe your vision is activated and John began leaping in the womb in the womb and actually the Bible says he also received the Holy Ghost In the Womb [Applause] Hallelujah blessed is she that believed the moment she believed by her God started building something from nothing she that was nothing was now used by the Lord in a mighty way without receiving any physical SE she brought forth the savior of the world maybe you have something in your womb that will save a lot of young people that will save a lot of people from the Oh Glory to God that will save a lot of people from early Graves it is in your womb but dead and by the power of the end through the Holy Spirit God wants to activate [Applause] it creating something from nothing she just built everything step by step in the message because I literally felt that something was happening in my life we are Builders but we we don't have raw materials we are building something from nothing what we have is a vision you're building your life from nothing to something great I personally did not inherit anything anything from my father looking back I'm not interested I'm not interested even if I had a chance to inherit why friends it is so satisfying to be something from nothing hallu when God gives a vision of where your life should go of what it should become you will stop a lot of things you will have no time for many things your life will be focused you won't be pushed around anymore you will realize there is something to build there's this Vision to accomplish you see your education you will build it from nothing your marriage is about building many of you who get married people will tell you it will fail even if you've not not heard I'll just tell you the truth whoever gets married there are many people and many demons waiting for them to fail if you did not know I'll tell you that and Satan has literally given each of you time one year two years three Maxim but I tell you friends oh God we have a supernatural power and authority to build our marriages to build our family from nothing to Greatness they give me three years and here I am years and I'm still building we have been given a power and authority oh he's so young he can't make it no you don't know who I am some of you enter those battles begin exchanging words with such people leave them alone they don't know who you are Hallelujah there is greatness SE right in you it's a vision someone can speak words to you that will rape you apart you feel like I wish I had another way of doing this but let me tell you brother if God has given you a vision for business for marriage for education family whatever it is hold on to that vision and begin building begin building Every Day begin building by faith begin building by belief in the word it cannot fail hallelu don't expect something to happen without building you need to build that's even why we giving the little money it looks like so small so small we are building because we have a vision we want to have a church of our own a place where we can come and fellowship and worship God freely a place where we can have place for our Sunday school and things like that what is it we are building and if you cat that Vision you begin also giving you can't say you don't have money to give to that unless if you do not have this the vision and if you are here and you member of this church and you don't give towards the land fund it means you've not CAU the vision simple because even 2,000 is giving and when you give you are not only building yourself you building the bigger Vision if you give two don't say I'll be ashamed you give next time you give again God will give you more keeps increasing it's like tithe I've never seen a poor TI pair you give when you have small and God gives you bigger and you give again bigger I know all the people who pay TI in the church I usually follow I see them prospering the person was giving 10 I'm not surprised I not supposed to be that but if to you they have to put a rope on you you have no Revelation you have no vision of your life spiritually speaking these are things we must not compromise on if we have a vision your vision is connected to God is Vision you need a house of your own you need marriage you need a job what about God's when David built his house God told him you can't build mine he had Reasons I'm sure that was one of them you can't build you can't claim to have my vision when the whole time it was your vision but Solomon he he went away right away with God and God blessed him friends we can build from nothing can we stand we can build our church from nothing if the musicians can come please we can build our children from nothing we should not be fear or have any anxiety for the unknown amen we are building we building our success from nothing maybe if we want to Bow our heads what is God speaking to you concerning your life I'm here to tell you you can build from nothing yes you can don't listen to those voices that tell you you can't you're greater than you know the vision that God has impressed upon you write it down it will surely come to you can build you can beh upon my life onto many other Generations after me let this be the prayer of each person Lord he has showed strength with his arm he has the proud in the imagination of their hearts he has put down the mighty from their seats and exalted them of L degree let let God EXT you you may be of L degree today but that's not the mind of God look your vision he has filled the angry with good things and the rich he has sent empty away he has HED helped his servant Israel in remembrance of his mercy and he spake to our fathers to Abraham and to his SE forever Lord Jesus let the same words be in my mouth and in my sister and brother's mouth here today looking in the congregation [Music] Lord you permitted me to see a few things that have prophesied over them there's a great future Lord a great future upon each [Music] one the musicians if you can put it down a little bit great [Music] future great future even as I was studying this the Holy Spirit impressed it upon me if I could I could speak names of each individual things that are going to be God knows your life it is in his hands but you see how he works it's not even by me telling you it is by him giving you the vision and you receiving it and then he begin building building building something great from nothing you may have been disappointed [Music] before I have a word for some people [Music] here who have been maybe abandoned or forsaken or

but it is your season and when your season is right you can make a d speak when the season is right you can even make a hungry Prophet prophesy against his will when your season is right you can even
