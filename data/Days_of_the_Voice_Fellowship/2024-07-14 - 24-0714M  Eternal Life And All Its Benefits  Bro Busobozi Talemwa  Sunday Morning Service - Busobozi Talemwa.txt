first it was those of brother Henry so um sister Winnie and the children are not able to make it this morning because of Amen two more things I want to speak on before we open the scriptures I wanted to I informed you already but I wanted to now announce that we are starting our uh radio program the Lord of course laid it on my heart some several months ago I was supposed to begin in January but somehow uh we've been quite busy with other things and um so I think this is the time um we were able to I was initially going to start at is it and then before we concluded our uh talks with the station I saw the announcement that uh but my desire was to minister in English because of several reasons um although I I learned that English programs are more expensive than local programs slightly more expensive uh but nonetheless we are long story short we are going to start a program at Radio Uganda what you call UBC is the national station and we will be doing uh I think it's called UBC red UBC red it's it it goes all across the central all Eastern all North including West uh so it has a a wide coverage it does not go to the West I think there's a lot of work already done in the west uh it's not enough but I'm sure that it's already brothers who are evangelizing in that area even on radio so God has not led us towards the direction here but I feel there is quite little more work that needs to be done spreading this truth this message to uh those areas um will you pray over this pram so uh it will cost us a total of 800,000 a month for just 15 minutes every program four times a week Sunday morning um we were supposed to begin this Sunday but we sent in the recordings a bit late informed that we will begin the program will begin airing next Sunday so 7:45 in the morning on Sunday up to 8 so that is the arrangement so I'd like you to remember that in prayer but also you can partner with us I want Partners who are consistent you you come and tell us Pastor I have a burden to partner in this radio program and I'm going to be giving 100,000 every month 200,000 whatever much you can be able to even 10,000 even five but I want serious consistent partner because even what God starts does not yeah I meant he finishes does not leave it in the middle so if you want a continuous blessing come and partner with us continue There is no one with a responsibility it is you it is us with a responsibility those before us did their part it is now our part our time do our part there is no one who is going to evangelize Uganda with this message I know we've gone on the streets andiz on the streets and that will continue but I feel that this radio broadcast covers a bigger area and many are able to hear that so if you can't go and do it let your money go there for you amen and God will bless you for that and we have believed God here for great things we have believed God for those who are jobless to get jobs and I'm seeing that God is already doing it uh imagine um brother brother Andrew it's not only marriage that did it although that's part of it but also you are giving yourself to the service of God imagine someone struggling the whole youth meetings is running up and down and he does this is one of the people who are not sleeping and a few several others as well God sees you God sees your giving and what you do to to the to his service and I tell you nothing can go unpaid or unrewarded sometimes you may be an unsung hero and we never talk about what you do yeah the works you do the things you but God sees it God sees it and imagine a brother running up and down the whole time very tired and on the last last minute when he's when the youth meetings are concluded is invited to go and do an aptitude test that's not easy sever have done it and I've failed even after practice and and you know trying to prepare [Music] themselves but he went and passed it with fly why because he had already prepared himself by giving himself and serving God and then here he he goes and is in the perfect will of God is in hison is a perfect will of God he was not running around with God imag if he was coming out of sin and then he received that message he would have failed terribly but he was in the perfect will of God and and you know come and get how do you know to put on your phone at that moment it was not a coincidence it must have been the angel of the Lord who came and told you switch on your phone now and he gave you allance my God we need to serve God if you serve him you can he cannot fail you and then our brother is here to give a testimony that the lord gave him the job and just like our brother Joel also give the testimony and all those who want jobs who want better jobs just receive it and believe it amen and when you get it don't disappear from church come and continually serve God I can almost tell you if you get a job and it makes you disappear from the presence of God it did not come from God I'm not going to apologize for that whatever job God gives you will make you stay in his presence if if you know you are in the perfect will of the perfect will of God cannot take you out of the presence so we don't want people who are lazy not working saying they always in prayer seven days a week no we don't want that but you also don't want people who are busy too busy to be in the presence of God we don't want that too you know David prayed he said let me not be poor so I don't ashame you and I don't but also let me not be so rich that I forget you so that's that should be your prayer whatever comes from God should make you serve him and one of the things we were asking God to give us jobs and incomes was because of the land fund project now I have been told by the uh team leaders that many of our church members are becoming dant on the WhatsApp groups which were formed uh the team leaders sent a message and you keep quiet that's what I've been told you you keep quiet Brethren God bless you we beginning our contributions brethren we should be ashamed of ourselves that is not good this is our responsibility your tell your neighbor it is your respons if you're muting other WhatsApp groups go ahead but the one of the land fund should never be muted keep it there even if you don't have money keep it there and you can never say you don't have money you just don't have what you want to give but you can give what you have how will me a man with Des eyes to give 5K a beautiful girl like to give 10 it doesn't matter 2000 give it there let the team leaders record and then the other thing if a team leader is complaining that the people are not giving one of the reasons could be that you are not being an example you know in our team which I am a part of in ouram he wants to bring himself in my team in my team you our team leader always she's number one when she's telling us let us contribute she says she brings the list number one number two number 20 30 but she's number one on the list and she's putting how much she has given so that's how a leader leads show the way show them the way and I know many of you team leaders are doing it and like I said God sees that you know keep doing it and um to you who have been silent you're bringing down our contributions and by the way uh I think you forgot to read the overall amount the total he gave us was only for the 24 weeks 20 something Millions at the end of the service I'll give you another announcement regarding that but for now I'd like to say let us please be encouraged let us not give up let us encourage our team leaders and our teams to keep keep keeping on we started this to finish it we are going to buy our church land we are not presuming we mean it if someone thinks we are presuming just watch watch and see that the lord is good he he will accomplish it shall we stand on our feet we go to the word praise God I have too much to share with you this morning I I I just um requesting that you will give me your your undivided attention as much as you will pull the Lord will give you know we pull by saying amen by receiving what he gives us and as I say usually please let us avoid moving out I believe we unless you're sick I believe all of us can sit for one hour and half two hours without moving out the deacons can help us on that God bless you so we will go to uh John chapter 3 vers 16 i' would like to pray again before I read Lord Jesus I've just opened your holy word and I'm going to read the with together with my brother Henry father we are standing before these people not because we are the best or because we know what to do but we are standing here depending on you we can read but we cannot give inspiration father may you give us the inspiration and chel every soul here today in in that the line of the inspiration of' given to us we will all hear from Heaven many people are not able to attend services on S the week and they can only make it on Sunday but I pray that you will soften their eyes and open their mind help them to cast everything aside that they will open the channel through which the Holy Spirit Will minister to them Father we are yielding ourselves we ask that you will have your way in Jesus name amen amen John 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting [Music] life for go for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him is not condemned let me read that again and listen to me while I read it again he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and the men love Darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved amen you may be seated please um today I'm speaking to you on the subject of eternal life and all its benefits I'd like to welcome the friend ofab God bless nice to see you again I think this is your second time and all those that are visiting with us this morning God bless you I saw Rachel I think I did not expect you to be back this nice to see you God bless you amen I'm happy to see each and every one of you are we ready for the word this morning and so we are not here we have been out there to make money and learn how to make money and do this and that family and PR now we here to learn more of God to grow Also spiritually so I want you to open your spiritual mind to feed don't just look at me be a participant be a participant by saying amen amen I I usually call this my Amen Corner so whoever is around here in the front I want you to shout amen if you cannot then you will need toen back there praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen praise the name of the Lord Amen brother Brian I always love you amen it should be the biggest the other time I spoke on I think it was on a wenesday what Resurrection will you be a part of and um many people told me they were blessed but also a few questions came out of it as a reason because I I did say that there are some there are others who will get eternal life who were previously not the bride [Music] so this morning I want us to kind of maybe learn a little bit uh more of the scriptures on on this subject and so be ready to delve into the scriptures and the so put on your spiritual thinking caps amen so because you see God gives eternal life but eternal life it is God's prerogative to give it do you believe that before the fall man who was eternal okay man who was a let that s man was there was God there was man and there was the creation Now God is eternal but before Man was created God created the Angelic being these Angelic beings were also I should say supernatural beings the reason they were created was to worship okay now that's why if you read in the Book of Genesis 1 the Bible says in the beginning was uh in the beginning was God sorry in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth what does the word God mean the word god means the object of worship so now it means God was already being worship this Elohim this eternal being the one who was self-existent had now created beings that were already worshiping him day and night and that's why here he says in the very first verse he was already God but there was a time God was not God you cannot hear any theology saying that but our Prophet said that there was a time God was not God there was a time he was not worshiping but then when he created beings to worship he became God and then he was being worshiped but you see he had created everything all the angels and everything on Earth but he never did have anything in His image in his likeness so in Genesis 1 verse 20 he says let us create man in our own IM and the Bible says so God created man in his own image so now man when he was created by God before the fall he was eternal like God was eternal he was all powerful like God was all powerful he was a Creator like God was a Creator do you understand what I'm saying he was in the image of God he was a spirit even as God was a spirit everything God was Adam was amen and man was like they have too much sterio here brother and man was like God on Earth and he enjoyed eternal life are you following me now I want you to keep your thoughts together here praise God man was a CO creator with God he was supposed to multiply not to reproduce he you will get it he was supposed to multiply not to reproduce amen I don't know if in makes sense to you you know reproduction would come in later on as a result of a can knowledge of a man and a woman and that the Bible would say we are born in sin we are not born in sin because we um uh you know we we we did something bad we are born in sin because of the way we were born our father and our mother meeting in in in in the acts they did I should say the last full acts of their flesh the desires of the Flesh and out of that came people we were born in sin man was not supposed to give birth like that because remember man was like God man was supposed to give birth like God how did God give birth to ad God spoke the word amen and man was so Adam was supposed to give birth like God by speaking the word and then and then Eve give birth but but when the enemy came in everything change and you tell me Pastor how is that even possible that is exactly what happened later as we shall see you see he was supposed to multiply and fill the Earth by the power of the spoken word like God but after the fall man died man was eternally separated from God he no longer had access to the life or the Tree of Life the Tree of Life Is God himself he is only God that is the source of life it is God's life we don't have another source of Life Satan can't give life that is even why when a prostitute has a baby she says God has given me a child and it is true when when Eve gave bir to Cain she said I've got a child from God but that child amen was gotten out of adultery but it was true even if Cain was not a son of Adam but Cain was given by God because all life comes from God is the only source of life even the Devil Himself his life it came from God do you understand God there is no life that did not come from God and that's what the Bible says do not fear Him who can destroy the body but cannot destroy the soul but he said fear Him who will destroy both who can destroy both the soul and the body praise God brother Dixon you need to go and help I'm really struggling with the sound I have too much stere you here and I I cannot I cannot seem to concentrate all right praise the name of the Lord you people need always to pray for the for the service because while we come here to fight the enemy he also always fights tries to find a way he will come through to [Music] fight I want you to imagine that the enemy Satan himself the life that he has was given to him by God and it can be taken away by God so the life that you have was given by God all right now the sound is good just increase it now it can only also be taken [Music] away so now when when sickness you know when sin came in sickness pain it all came in man that was supposed to be in the image of God man that was supposed to have dominion over everything on Earth was now a total failure he became a total failure we later on see in the scripture that meth is the longest living man and he lived 969 years me could not even live one day so death is total separation from God do you understand what this means this means the eternal life that man had that eternal life was taken away from him by sin when it came in you see but God promis Redemption Redemption is to be taken back in everything that you lost to be given back the glory that you love to be given back the life that you you know so God promise Redemption the devil thought he had got he had got Adam Adam the Son of God but the devil did not know that he was only a piece of what came out of God by the spoken word if God could create sat and he could create there is nothing that could go beyond what God can do are you following me when Satan fell from Glory he he fell with many angels with and he thought he would come down to the Earth and I will tell you why he came down because in heaven he thought he would take over but he could not take over who can stand before the king no one can no one will because he's the king of kings he the Lord of lords there is no one can go over and beyond our go and he was cast down here and he began dancing I am now going to get the human race and I will squeeze life out of them but he did not know that the sameone who cast him out of Heaven he gave them that life and when he took life out of do you know what God was getting ready to just begin when the devil thought he had won was just getting ready to just start amen praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord you need to understand there are many things I want to say please pray for me that God will give us a good atmosphere for these things to come for you need to understand the ministry of Jesus Christ Jesus was more than a prophet he was more than a son he was more than a human being Jesus was God himself amen but what did he do how did he create Adam I ask you how did he create Adam by the spoken word so how did he create uh Jesus there was a woman who did not know any man amen and she was a virgin but God came down amen and spoke a word said thou shall be with a child amen you call his name Jesus said how will these things be he the power high will overshake and you will be pregnant with a child tell me how can science explain a woman becoming pregnant without being touched by a man that is beyond science that is beyond religion that is beyond theology amen that can only be explained by the Supernatural and if you don't believe in the Supernatural you cannot understand this you have to go beyond what you know that's why we have faith because Faith you believe in The Invisible Faith you believe in what you cannot see you believe it as if you possess when the angel told Mary Mary you are going to be with child she said but how will it be and the answer she received she could not understand it the answer she received she could not fom it she could not explain it but she believed it because the angel said the holy spirit will the power of of the one on high will overtake it just like that yes just like that who was it the same word the same word she had the word that created a child in a womb the same word she had is Jesus the same word she had is Jesus people didn't get that the word she had in her ears is Jesus the Bible says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the word she had was Jesus because in verse 14 he says and the Word was made manifest was made manifest so the word came from Glory came anded down and was made manifest right in the womb ofy and Mary was caring the word who is the word the word is God and Mary was caring in her womb what was that it was the immortal being car by the M there is something I'm getting it was the immortal being Cared by theal can you understand that it was eternity right within Time Eternity came down and United with time in order to remove time and to take you who living in and take you back to when Jesus was born he said I came from God I came from eternity I come from God and I go back to God it doesn't mean there was another God means he was God he came from God he was gone and he's going back in the image he was in [Music] you are getting it now amen so now Jesus was the plan of God to reconcile us back again to redeem us back again to our place of Eternity he was that plan that's why the Bible calls him the son of God why because the first Son of God sinned the devil thought that when he kills the Son of God Adam he will finish everything the holy spirit is reminding me SC should read for you he could not kill the Son of God my God my God my god listen I like us to go in Corinthians where the Bible gives this distinction between the first and the second [Music] Adam in 1 Corinthians 55 okay we'll begin from verses uh all right we just go to 45 right away and so it is written the first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit are you following me the first man Adam was made a living soul but the last Adam who is the last Adam know Jesus the second Adam was Jesus the first Adam was Adam the last Adam was Jesus the first Adam was made a living soul and we are from that Adam a living soul but the last Adam was made a quickening spirit sayange that a quickening spirit a quickening soul but a quicking spirit did you get that now do you know aing spirit amen is a spirit that gives life so Jesus was not a mere Soul Jesus was the quickening SP Jesus himself was the quickening power Jesus was the one that gives life that's why he said I am the way I am the truth I am this life no man come to the father but by me why because he was the how B that was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual Hallelujah the first man is of the Earth the second man the second man is the Lord From Heaven if you understood it shout amen the first man is of the Earth but the second man the second man he did not say he came from heaven but he said the second man is the Lord From Heaven do you believe the Bible Jesus was the Lord From Heaven praise the name of the Lord that's why in Revelation 3:4 he say un the end of the L dist right these things sayth the amen the faithful the true witness he's a faithful he's amen of God he's a true witness he the beginning of the creation the beginning did you hear that I thought Adam was the beginning of the creation of let us create man in our image Adam lost that image and Adam lost the beginning of the creation every child Adam gave birth to was now a sinner it was no longer the creation of God what your mother and father gave birth to is not the image of God that image of God was lost long time ago when Adam and Eve that's why we have failure we have pain we have suffering we have diseases we have anger that's why we born last why because we are trapped in these bodies you know we born the bodies of sin these were not supposed to be our natural our real spiritual bodies the glory life because we lost image of God what is the image of God is a spiritual Supernatural Eternal image it is sinless it cannot suffer pain it cannot suffer sickness no it is perfect it is just like God himself and Adam was that when the devil came he thought he had finished the creation of God but God jumped you know you know jumped the devil and he went right here and created for himself another image praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord I wanted to follow Clos the creation of God everybody the creation of God the creation of God Adam was that image was that Perfect Image when you see Adam you seen but Adam and the devil began I'm now possessing Adam and all his creation that's why you are born with things you don't want some of you are born with anger with envy and you are fighting it but it's not going some of you are fighting with lust and Christians are very good at hiding it Christians want to behave as if they have no problem but let me tell you says is the most sick body on Earth you see what is happening we are born with all those last fulfilling those desires the pride of the world and the pride of life and the lust of the eyes these things we are struggling with are you hearing me we are struggling with them we seem not to be to break out of them trying but not trying Paul said what when I want to do comes before me what is happening we are born in a backslid step we lost that Eternal touch we lost that Eternal you know creation and when the devil thought he had won you know right there at the beginning God already had prophesied and he prophesied and said to the woman praise the name of the Lord he said because you've done this The Serpent and you are create enmity the serent he said that you the child or rather let me let me read it properly so that I can be able to get the context right in Genesis if you can turn there with me praise God and I will put this is 3:15 and I'll put enemity between thee and the woman and between th seed and her seed and it shall Breeze thy head and thou shall breath his heel are you following me are you following me I'll put an enemity between thee and the woman now I want you to imagine this the Bible here is giving God rather is giving a prophecy and the devil was not understanding what God was talking about God was speaking in secret in Mysteries when he said I'll put an between you and the woman and your seed and her in here follow me closely we able to see that the serpent has a seed everybody tell your neighbor the serpent has a seed all right and the woman has a seed okay now the woman can't have a seed naturally speaking so the seed of the woman here is talking about a child a boy a human being that would be born by a woman without being touched by a man are you following me has that ever happened in human history before then no it can never happen so there is no way the devil could understand what God was meaning it was a mystery so that Satan has a SE and even today we have serpent seed on Earth did you know that I don't know whether we have some here I hope we don't yes serpent seed is on Earth those ones they will never believe the word no matter what you do you get a hmer and Hammer they will never accept serp seed no matter how the preacher is or how good he is they will never change one day God himself came down and that was Kan he said but if you do well won I receive you was I accept did Kan accept he behaved as if he was doing well and God came back he said where is your brother he said am I my brother's he had already mured that is serpent SE thank God we are not serpent SE hallelujah hallelujah serent SE himself came down and preached the never change let me tell you if you come and sit under the word no matter how bad you are the word will change you you keep coming to ch if you can't be changed then you are Ser I believe you can be change because you are a seed of God Amen Hallelujah I told you I have a lot to cover tonight if you give me time and and your attentiveness and and you open your heart I believe you we in for something wonderful so see now here is a prophecy where he says um I will put an between your seed and her seed and it shall breathe thy head who the seed of the woman will bre the head of the and and and the seed of the serpent or the serpent will breee the heel of of the of the of the uh the heel of the uh of the seed of the woman when was that fulfilled that was fulfilled on the cross Jesus was the seed of the woman tell your neighbor Jesus was the seed of the and the serpent breed his heal by casting him on the cross and beating him piercing his side Anda him up and killing him breed his heal but that was just a little heal a heal does not kill if the devil wanted he could even cut it not just breathing it could not kill the devil thought he had killed Jesus when he he bred but he also did not know that Jesus was the promised seed of the woman who was prophesied to come and breathe the head of the serent and the moment heal of Jesus was bre the and he was in Hell celebrating throwing a party imagine all the demons there see saying we have won we have won and then they hear what was that it was the seed of the woman who had appeared right in the head quarters of hell and he had come to breathe the head of once and forever that's why when he died on the cross he said it is the f the devil did not understand what he meant BYU it was a mystery just like genesis 3:15 was a mystery it is finished was a mystery until he finally opened his eyes and he saw Jesus the Same Jesus he had killed he saw him in Hell calming down to bre the head of the to take over what had Jesus going to do oh listen to me church he had gone to set forth a new pattern everyone that was dying before that time going to hell even the Believers they were going to another compartment of Hell Paradise they were going there were there was a lock on the door they were in prison there were others in another compartment who were born unbelievers they were also locked there they were locked there I had a preacher the other time saying pcal preacher that paradise where the Believers go is in hell and I was like oh yeah that's true according to the old version so he's having the old version The Gospel but now listen to the new version of the message Hallelujah so now it is true they were in Hell locked up there and others were in Hell the The Souls of those who were nonbelievers chained there and there was hell itself the Throne of Satan itself so now when Jesus came the very first place he went to was the headquarters itself of the Devil Himself heu he went there to take over to take authority to ass his authority as the seed of the woman that was promised to come and when he arrived there he said I've come to take over and the prophet dramatized it he said he must have knocked and the devil asked all the are you here are you here and after he did the call all of them were around said now who Could That Be before he could know who it was Jesus B the door open and he came you know like those movies they used to act many years ago rainbow Jesus is our champion hallelujah hallelujah amen Jesus is our star he entered come to take over and when he came in the devil began Shing began string he said are you the one he said I am the one when he was saying are you the one the devil knew what he was talking about he now knew this was the seed of the woman in Genesis he now knew this was the wheel in the middle of the wheel that eel saw now knew this is the Ancient of Days that Daniel spoke about he now knew this was the one that was at the cross he now knew everything the prophets he said are you the one he said yes I am the one and I've come to take over give me those K give me those and he took the from him hallelujah amen glory he took the the of took the keys of hell he said there is no believer will ever come back again because I've come to Institute a new face eternity has come back again Hallelujah I am restoring I am redeeming every redeemable Soul I'm here to give them back eternal life that they had before the fall and the devil Jesus Took The King and gave him a knockout and they took the C where were all the demons they must have been there surprised and Sh for their life don't let any of those demons scare you because the one you serve defeated all of them Hallelujah they are defeated the devil is defeated is defeated we are fighting a defeated [Applause] devil he has no power over the redeemed of the Lord he has no right over the redeemed and he took the keys and left hell completely defeated hell is still the same way today hell even today is still defe even tomorrow even forever that's why I believe should never fear what the devil will do David knew that the Lord is my shiper I shall not walk he leadth me in the path of righte for his name yeah even though right I walk through the valley the Earth where we are the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou for thou it is a revelation Fe no evil brother Fe no evil sister Fe no evil I have no fear Jesus Works fear not sickness fear no failure by the way even sickness the moment you get that grip on the grip on who you are sickness cannot hold it cannot it cannot oh Hallelujah hallelu and Jesus walked out of hell of the Throne of Satan and he walked out he said I now I have to go among this bunch of the of the of the ones that refuse to believe I preached on that once you know the thief was the two theves who were on the cross one of them refused to believe and another one believed those were the last of both those [Music] places one of them Jesus told him I'll meet you in Paradise the other one of course he went to help the other compartment of it was the time now for Jesus to show them the others were the other one was laughing save yourself and save us and said don't you fear God father he says Master please let me be he said I'll be you will be with me in and this was the moment and Jesus after finishing with the devil he walked into the the other part of Hell the compartment of the nonbelievers he opened bam says as was passing there were voices out of that hole crying sh for us us open for us so when he went he opened and saw them I believe that other Thief saw him said and he said please he only said one word why did you not believe he bang the door brother believe well you have the ch he did not have time to waste that's why he sends preachers today to preach to you he takes the time here in h he has no time to waste with nonel and then he Way by passed there straight away the morning was coming the morning was coming he was doing everything fast and then he quickly do another compan where the Believers were those who are died in Christ amen and he opened and then right there the other Thief saw him he said you have come have come wow Daniel was there Daniel saw saw Ruth saw him Mary saw him come on all of them were there well of course I think Mary had not yet gone therey was still on Earth but all the others they saw him and they were so happy and here was something that made me happy sah and Abraham they saw him Hallelujah and they said have you come he said yes I've come so are we coming out of here he said yes I have the keys coming out of here am Glory hallelujah amen and when he open the door listen when you open the door Mary said rather who is this Sarah told Abraham can we ask him we at least have a Whistle Stop in Jerusalem so we see how things are now because been many that we can now go to heaven they ask him father Master can we stop in Jerusalem you can do whatever you want so they came out and the Bible says they people people on Earth they saw them for 40 days hallelujah amen imagine seeing someone that you reading on in the books this and a moment and many people kept on saying appearing disappear disapp disappear they were living in another dimension and when they finished up they wrapped up everything and they went in another paradise they went in another paradise in Heavenly plac where they are until today one of these days hallelujah when a trumpet of God shall those people will rise again we will be changed and together with them we shall go and be with the Lord let me tell you this is a reality this is how the Rapture will be first Thessalonians 4 16 you can read it that's what it say praise the name of the Lord so you see these people had got eternal life back again Jesus from that day he instituted another Testament this testament which was sealed by his own [Music] blood that's why he's saying for God so L that he gave his only begotten son follow me closely he was a begotten son when the devil killed Adam the son of God the devil did not know that God who created Adam can create another son God said okay that's what you have done all right wait for me so God formed a body a son for himself Towell in the body was human spoken word of God it was spoken into existence the body was finite the body was a human being the body was just like you and me 100% man but God himself in this body this body was called the Son of God begotten by God by the spoken word and God himself came in him just like Adam when he breathed in him the Breath of Life Adam was perfect was eternal but when sin came to do it over again and here he created a body in the wom of a woman and God himself on the day of baptism he came right in that body and it was even spoken by the heavens this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased so God declared by the heaven I am right inside this whatever he says I say whatever he BS i b whatever he creates I create he is the life I am the life he the I am and I am you understand whatever oh my God hallelujah whatever God spoke about himself in the Old Testament he spoke about Jesus because Jesus was the visible image of the invisible [Applause] God you understand that so Jesus was eternal Hallelujah in his Spirit he was God himself so why did he come God loved the world but he gave his only begotten whosoever believe in that son should not perish but have everlasting life Hallelujah now what is life life is God's life is eternal life he that believeth on him is not condemned follow me closely the one who believes in the son will not be condemned what is condemnation condemnation is you know on the day of judgment that's where the condemnation is but the Bible says here whosoever believeth on the son shall not be condemned so now you have to understand that we only can be able to receive Eternal in the Son of God who is he the word the ethopian UN he was working with Philip water and Philip asked him a question he said do you now believe said yeah I believe I want you to B he said ah if you believe with all your heart he said I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God meaning I believe that Jesus Christ is God in flesh said then I bapti and heaped and the says he that believes on him he that believeth not is condemned already because he that has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of and this is the condemnation the light is coming to the world and Men love Darkness rather than the light because their deeds were evil for everyone that doeth evil hurs the light neither comes to the light let his deeds be reproved praise the name of the Lord are you following church so Jesus fulfilled the prophecy her seed will breath the head of of the serpent he literally came to take the place of The Sinner he came to take the place of Adam and his Fallen rest Oh Glory to God he came and he took Adam's Place he was the new creation of God please understand it from the spirit here Adam was the first creator first Adam second Adam the first Adam the second Adam came to bring back everything the other to restore him to redeem him to bring him back to the image the Eternal image of God and so he literally took the place of Adam and by his work on the cross he fully restore The Sinner back to Eternity back to Eternity remember there was Ser too so now oh my God now you see today by the time Jesus came on Earth there were two seeds the seed of God and the SE of the serpent but he came to redeem all the redeemable but there was to so how can we separate them how can we say those ones who are from the family of can we say the white people or the people or the yellow people cannot do it that way because since the days of Noah we can no longer follow those Lage there was a mix up so every oh my God don't miss this everything has now been placed under one thing faith faith faith please connect with the SP get this here he says for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son who Whoever has Faith him who is him the word Oh Glory that's why the bride Leeves every word you understand it not you believe it you understand it you believe it you figure it out you believe it you can't figure it out you believe it you don't de with the word are you hearing young people you don't debate with a word tell your neighbor don't debate with a word whatever the word says you believe if the Bible says do not forsake Fellowship you say Amen right because it is the word of God and you do it if the Bible says live holy live a holy life you say if the Bible says pay your ti you say Amen if the Bible says give your offerings you say we are believers if the Bible says women should not wear men's clothes we don't debate you said it I believe you say it it is done believer don't believe I heard a preacher very respected preacher stand before his lying thousands of people and telling them lies about the issue of the women preachers you know in those days are you trying to say don't don't debate don't reason with if the word says it I believe don't not debate if the Bible says that Deon must be a married man with one wife how many say I believe if he says he must not be a double tonged man his wife must also be under subje we simp say Amen if you find if he says a bishop must be married to one wife a bishop is a pastor but these days you find Pastor a bishop you know having more than one wife you divorce the other one divor other even if you divorce that should still your wife so you are a man of more than one wife and you have no right on the pit as a as a bishop or pastor but you see they neglect those scriptures and they call them whatever they want to call but the bride body the True Body of Christ will always believe every [Music] word first John 3:7 you're G going to give me more time so I can get this somewhere now little children let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous and even as he is righteous he that commit sins of the devil for the devil sinth from the beginning for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of hell hell the Son of God was manifested now the Son of God is Jesus he was manifested to destroy the works of the but also he was manifested to manifest more sons of God I'll go ahead of myself first John 3:2 beloved now now are we the sons of God tell your neighbor I am a Son of God now if you're a Son of God you are manifested to destroy the works of the devil believe it sister for yourself even when things are difficult you keep repeating it over I am manifested to destroy the works of the devil if the works of the devil in your family if they in your life you confess it I am manifested to destroy the works of the devil everybody repeat those words I am manifested to destroy the works of the devil say it again I am manifesting to destroy the works of the devil praise the name of the Lord now the Bible here says that the purpose of him was to destroy the works of the devil and whosoever that is born of God does not commit sin for his SE remain in him and cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever does not righteousness is not of God nether he that loveth not his friends I want you to follow this through Adam had his sons we are naturally speaking but the second Adam also has his son we are spiritually how are we born by the word you must receive a word birth that's why we come to church we hear the word to be born by the word to accept the word b into the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord John 839 they answered and said unto him Abraham is our father these are the Jews now speaking to Jesus Abraham is our father Jesus sayi unto them if ye were Abraham's children ye would do the works of Abraham but now ye seek to kill me a man that has told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father they say to him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God now when when when Jesus brought the word he was the word and he came to these people they rejected him and then when they rejected him they said Abraham is our father we don't know you Jesus said to them sincerely If Abraham is your father and you were his children you would do the works of ab but you want to kill me a man that has told you the truth and they said he told them your The Works your father are the your your father is a devil because you are doing his Works they said what our lineage was correct came from Abraham and our father is God we are not born out of fornication they said they were born in the correct way it doesn't matter your father or mother if you reject the word your father is not God I might as well say your father is the devil these people we from the L of abrah but when they rejected Christ the he told them I've now know you are of the devil your father is the devil talking about our father is God we did not come from fornication Jesus said to them if God was your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God my my my my my my Hallelujah this was a Mis St to their heart but they rejected him they did not know it was God standing before them they were blind fact it was God before them and they were rejecting them they were rejecting him and claiming they were believing in God and God said and Jesus said well if you are saying God is your father I have something to tell you also I came forth from God I didn't come here of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech someone needs to open up and shout on top of this generation and tell them why don't you understand the message even because you cannot hear my word are of your father and the last of your father you will do now Jesus is in the spirit now the anointing is upon him and he begins to tell them you will do the works of your father he was a m from the beginning what are you seeing here you are seeing God giving these people genealogy they thought they knew their genealogy they said we are we are sons of Abraham Son of God and he told them wait a minute because you cannot hear what I'm telling and yet I came from God in other words I'm God himself standing before you here you can't understand me because you can't hear my word now listen to me let me tell you your you are of your father the devil and the last of your father you do your father was a murderer from the beginning he B not in the truth because there is not truth in him when he speak a lie he speak of his own for is a liar and a father of it oh my I hope there is no liar in the church today because if you are a liar you are showing who your father is you have a character of Satan and you need God to change you you need to be born again by the word of God because the spirit of Life comes from Satan the father of life oh God help us where are you brother I am here Pastor I'm I'm reaching you and you know you are telling a lie and you are a Believer your B calls you you are late because you you you you walk up late and you are still at home in bed okay where are you I'm about to reach you are a liar you are a liar let these words echo in your ears you liar you need to be born again yes if you have a spirit of life you need God to change you need to be born again by the word of God and by the spirit of God Believers don't tell lies slap your neighbor and tell them believer hallelujah hallelujah and you find preachers they on pit they are telling lies it is a lie brother if it is not in the word of God you are teaching is a lie if it is not in the Bible can I tell you some lies they teach caniz they teach they teach us that God is three persons in one I want you to shout out and say it is a lie they teach us the Trinity it is a lie they teach us that women can be pastors it is a lie right they say it doesn't matter what you wear God looks at your house it is a lie right they they encourage women to cut of their hair what is it what is it Church oh my god there are quite many lives they have Li us they tell us we can baptize our babies what is that what is that it is a lie it is a lie they tell us people can pray for us on behalf of us before God for example like Mary it's a lie God bless you it's a lie they tell us they have some scapular they tell us if you wear this one and die while wearing you will go to paradise it is a lie they tell us our works our good works will buy etal life and a lie continues and but we are Bible Believers we are when we say message end time message Believers it's not a new religion it's not a new idea it the same Bible teachings we Hallelujah am and if you don't believe in part of it you have to suit yourself but I'm telling you this is the truth the word is the truth the message is the truth and Jesus Christ is the truth and the life and he says and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god hear God and he them not because you are not of God when the word of God says under no circumstance unbeliever and Paul said how can light mix with darkness and Paul says that separate yourself from them be separate what Concord does a Believer have with an unbeliever how can two work together L they be agreed and you you are a sheep but are saying I'm going to marry a God there is a problem with you you are a ship but you are saying I'm ring a horse sheep matter sheep unless there's a wrong Spirit of unbelief you cannot rest until you say God take the wrong desire out of we are all born with the wrong desires brother sister do not rest until that desire is dead we are not of the kind that says we Are Born This Way We Are Born This Way in our natural body after the first Adam but we have a new lineage the second Adam Jesus Christ this one has given us another nature if you see any sign of the old nature we are going to fight we are going to fight until we win over it until we defeat it we will not accept any character any nature the old man we have to crucify The Old Man and all his work can you shout [Applause] amen crucify the last crucify the spirit of telling crucify the desires to go drinkify the desires of the things of the world the old man has to die he cannot live you have to receive new desires the desires that come from eternal life from your origin your origin is from God beloved now we are the sons of God tell someone now tell two people right right now not tomorrow now who did you tell brother tell somebody now the reason why I ask you to tell someone is because I wanted to be a participant and I want you to confess what I'm saying confession is powerful some people I'm hry I will not tell my tell your neighbor now now I'm a Son of God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen now not tomorrow not tomorrow now what am I saying we have eternal life now woo amen now we have eternal life not tomorrow now I am not waiting for the Judgment Day now I have eternal life I belief of the truth now I have eternal there is there for now no condemnation to those who are in Christ who have passed from death into life now no more judgment no more [Music] [Applause] condemnation we cannot come before the Judgment Throne to be judged for what we did because whatever we did has been placed under the blood by our [Music] [Applause] faith oh my God woo yes sir that is what we call a royal Grand a royal Grand you don't deserve it your Works speak against you but simply because you believe the word you have faith in him he gives you a grant to receive eternal life now we are the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know Hallelujah we know I know we know I know when he shall appear I we shall be like him Hallelujah for we shall see him as he is when he comes I shall be like him because I received the life of God I have eternal life there is nothing I need to do to get eternal life I have already receive by faith in the Son of God the Son of God As I said is the word of truth that gives me eternal life and the people came that day they said s what must I do to be safe the prison God story what must you do said believe on the Lord Jesus CH by the way the easiest thing to do is to go in the Rapture Hallelujah because the Rapture it is not going to be on the basis of your many good on it is only on the basis of his good work the only thing you have to do is say I believe in it whatever I said he said I accept it don't debate with it even if you can't leave it yet you you you you you yielded yourself God I can't see this in me I believe it I want to see it in me you come here in prayer you come in fasting I want to see God's nature I want to see that life until but let me tell you brother as long as you believe every word you are sure you are coming in the resurrection you are coming in the fast resurrection and the Bible says blessed holy is he that comes in the first resurrection the second death has no power over the ones who go in the first resurrection are the ones who would have previously received eternal life by faith through Grace so other words received it Through the Ages God sent the messenger and they grabbed that word they believed in and on the basis of Faith they go in the Rapture tell me this is the easiest thing and that's why the devil tries to divert your he's trying to get many customers to take to help but brother keep coming to church because Faith Comes only by hearing the word amen amen what are we doing we are making working out our salvation with fear and and when the the trumpet sounds we will be there some people thought that they going to be surprised to see some people in the rupture no we are not going to be surprised no it's just like you're telling me we shall be surprised to see someone passing p7 we not studing with them no he has to study and prepare for exams if he doesn't he will fail right our preparation is ongoing Now by coming to church by hearing the word by yiing our to God and the more word we hear the more faith wece the more we hear the more Fai we receive in one of these days we shall receive rapturing and we will fly away but there going to be others who will get eternal life on the Judgment it will be the hardest the hardest I thought today I'll go through it but I see I don't have time to probably I'll do it on Sunday on Wednesday but see friends they are going to be others who will get eternal life on the Judgment Day who we are not part of the Bride but listen the only thing they will get is eternal life full stop but for us we receive eternal life by default here on Earth the rest is all the benefits of it we have many other benefits I can give you a few benefits here if I go ahead of myself praise the name of the Lord there is power power it's a benefit what is power power for what for healing for signs and wonders for gifts of the Holy Ghost I'm talking about the genuine biblical ones there's another that this we get here on Earth all right but then also while we here on Earth listen we have another benefit that is reigning over sin because the Bible says we are Kings and we are priests you can see someone who is not going in the Rapture they claim to have eternal life but their life is a very def life they are living in sin they are living any like the worldly people they going to the parties of the world you find a brother sister sweating dancing with unbelievers you are so defeated and you are claiming going the Rapture not the Rapture I know you can't get that benefit because you already failed here it's a symbol you failed but there's another benefit of a Believer who has received eternal life they will live an overcoming life here on Earth you will live above sin is God a liar God said You shall be Kings and Priests a king is somebody who rules over you rule over sin you rule over poverty are you hearing me if you're poor don't accept it because you are a king you're supposed to rule over pover to rule over bad situation rule over witchcraft rule trouble suffering rule bad situations rule over bad thoughts rule over last you are supposed to be a king over this you supposed to rule over sickness did you know someone who has receive eternal life should not be sick am there it is for you I believe that with all my heart you should not be sick because before the fall there was no sickness and if been restored back again redeemed back again we must not be sick because the eternal life ised within us am we must not be sick I don't even think Mary was sick when she had Jesus in you can check your Bible I don't but I doubt because Jesus was eternal life he was the source of life and when sickness came because Mary had the body that power that life push hallu amen but pastor we get sick because we are not claiming the benefits of eternal life yes but if we claim it sickness comes you begin claiming the Bible says if you are sick go let the Elders of the church anoint you with oil and PR but what do we do sick and you claim you're a Believer with eternal life do what the Bible says the medicine is right in there does it mean I don't know that people get sick when they are believers that's not what I'm I'm here to talk about I'm here to represent what the word of God is saying I'm giving it to you if you're a Believer you will say amen amen it is a benefit you are supposed to live a life beyond and above these things that's why when a brother or one of us is sick we come let us pray you remember one of them in the Bible even died out of sickness I think it was a grandmother of what was was it very old sister in the and she was very helpful they said no no no no she was Brethren let us come she cannot she cannot die who will do that when someone dies but they knew who they were can Lord she cannot die they called her name back again to life that's the God we Ser I'm hearing a lot of unbelief forget about your reasoning [Music] is what we believe look a Believer must live a potent life a life that is able because you see it's not your life it's the Life of Christ in you when a situation comes don't own it AC [Music] you understand there are some situations we don't have to accept we have to change our mindset we have to think different why because we are Eternal did you know right now even if you brought a gun and killed me I cannot die did you know that did you know there are many people here on Earth who cannot die kill them those are the ones who have eternal life you can't kill them you can kill their body if God permits but if God permitted not you kill their body praise the name of the Lord now another benefit when we go over there we going to with him it's a benefit that we will have the others won't have it we shall have you know ranks even there the Bible speaks of all these things these are benefits but others who will get etal life on the Judgment they will not have anything there will be commoners look at look at the kingdoms of the world the way they function in many ways it is like the kingdom of God you have different classes in the royal family you have different classes the servants you have different classes and now the commoners so many people who would get life will be Comm that's the truth that's the truth that's the truth on Wednesday I'll try to go a little bit deeper into you you'll be surprised because see if we going if God is going to have a kingdom on Earth what is the kingdom without people you understand it will have to have people but people who will be ruled over and Christ cannot rule over his own royalty you understand he have to rule the Lesser class and so you see the Muslims they have something like this going they believe the more you do better you will get that is also scriptural and on Wednesday maybe I'll touch it not for the bride these things are not for the bride the bride is not going to heaven because of our works go the Rapture who told only believe that was the theme of the only believe all things only if you believe eternal life is yours if you believe you going to Rapture but we will see on Wednesday how there many other groups who will suddenly go and attain etal life but that's all they get and we will rule over them forever and ever and ever andever and ever even after this world has passed [Music] away the word of God is amazing it is very special to be the bride of Christ to be the body of Christ it is something like nothing do not trade it for anything do not sell your breth right because of some little portion some little porage what what what is two five million what is 10 million is just some page it's nothing compar to the glory we shall receive don't say it for anything God bless you will
