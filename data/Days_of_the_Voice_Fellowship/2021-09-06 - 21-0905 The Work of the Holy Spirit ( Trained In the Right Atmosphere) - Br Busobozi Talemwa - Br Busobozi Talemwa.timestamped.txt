[43:08] holy spirit
[43:30] foreign
[43:36] [Music]
[43:51] manifestation
[44:03] [Music]
[44:04] because
[44:48] amen hallelujah i mean
[44:51] if you receive the holy spirit
[44:55] you must receive if you receive you
[44:58] believe the one you must receive
[45:43] that we might be justified by faith but
[45:45] after that faith is come we are no
[45:48] longer under a school master
[45:50] verse 26 for ye are all the children of
[45:54] god by faith in christ jesus
[45:58] can you read that brother
[46:04] where for the lord was our school master
[46:06] to bring us unto christ
[46:08] can you just interpret directly
[46:24] [Music]
[46:30] amen that we might be justified by faith
[46:36] but after that faith has come we are no
[46:38] longer under a school master
[46:50] [Music]
[46:54] you know who a school master is a
[46:56] teacher
[46:58] someone who trains you up
[47:01] someone who tells you what to do
[47:04] someone who tells you what not to do
[47:05] [Music]
[47:07] someone who guides you
[47:09] someone who prepares you
[47:12] someone who rebukes you
[47:14] [Music]
[47:15] are you following me
[47:17] all this is the work of a teacher
[47:21] but now we realize when all this is the
[47:25] work of the holy spirit
[47:27] [Music]
[47:29] the holy spirit is supposed to teach you
[47:32] the holy spirit is supposed to guide you
[47:35] the holy spirit is to show you things to
[47:36] come
[47:38] to protect you
[47:40] you should do all that work
[47:42] but before you receive the holy ghost
[47:45] that is the work of the school master
[47:49] and who is the holy spirit your holy
[47:52] spirit is jesus christ himself
[47:54] [Music]
[47:56] before he came
[47:58] there was the law why do you want me to
[48:01] take her and today
[48:02] in your individual life as a christian
[48:04] but everyone come to christ before you
[48:06] receive the holy ghost
[48:08] you must come here and sit under the
[48:11] word
[48:15] and be trained in the kingdom and be
[48:18] told what you ought
[48:46] before you receive him i don't know i
[48:48] must train you you're not quitting
[48:50] because the work of the holy spirit
[48:54] is for you to be trained
[48:56] is for you to be told what to do
[48:59] now after you receive the holy spirit
[49:03] and you hear me tell you what to do
[49:11] that's obvious
[49:29] people who usually have a problem with
[49:30] preachers or what the bible says is are
[49:32] those people who do not have the holy
[49:34] spirit
[49:35] [Music]
[49:41] but if you have the holy spirit
[49:44] and they bring a hammer at the helm of
[49:46] the world
[49:48] as long as this is the world
[49:50] you will accept it
[49:53] that's why if someone is doing something
[49:55] wrong java whatever
[49:57] [Music]
[50:22] hallelujah
[50:26] do not have choices before the age of
[50:28] accountability
[50:38] parents are fully responsible for god
[50:42] [Music]
[50:46] mothers and fathers i'm talking to you
[50:48] now
[50:50] you are fully responsible before god
[50:52] overnight
[51:49] you'll just have to sit them down and
[51:51] and teach them oh world inaudible
[52:09] [Music]
[52:13] i realized my daughter listened to the
[52:14] service very well
[52:27] [Music]
[52:29] we have the power to decide what we want
[52:48] [Music]
[52:49] [Applause]
[53:03] [Music]
[53:26] the bible says if if you accept him
[53:31] without the knowledge of your father
[53:34] and if your father gets to know about it
[53:38] but he has a god-given
[53:47] [Applause]
[54:02] [Music]
[54:16] and some people say well you know let
[54:18] them be the way they want to be you know
[54:20] you for us we just give birth to the
[54:21] flesh then yeah
[54:28] [Applause]
[55:31] amen i mean
[55:56] that man must have his house his family
[55:59] under subjection
[56:06] [Music]
[56:17] [Music]
[56:36] [Applause]
[56:41] the way a man has control over the house
[56:43] mama said there were a number to
[56:46] train up their children
[56:48] in the ways of god
[56:52] so that's the ministers of the world
[57:02] [Music]
[57:10] when someone is doing something wrong
[57:11] they just let it pass
[57:13] [Music]
[57:15] the holy spirit
[57:19] if someone is doing something wrong
[57:31] [Music]
[57:38] oh
[58:05] if you are given an
[58:06] opportunity by god to speak to his
[58:09] people
[58:12] and you're like let me talk things which
[58:13] will make them happy
[58:16] so they can love me i can be able to
[58:19] teach again
[58:38] [Music]
[58:47] will tell you that they are telling you
[58:48] to do things because they are led by the
[58:50] spirit
[58:52] of faith
[58:55] and they don't find what they are
[58:55] telling you to do in the bible
[58:59] run away from such preachers

[1:00:35] i am a preacher
[1:00:36] and what i preach
[1:00:38] i must preach it from the bible
[1:01:09] just like a mother like a father
[1:01:11] should not fear the children
[1:01:14] you train them but then they can you
[1:01:17] rebuke them
[1:01:18] you position them but they come with you
[1:01:22] yes i know

[1:08:29] to my opinion the greatest president
[1:08:31] that we ever had in this nation in the
[1:08:33] usa he says was abraham lincoln oh my
[1:08:36] god
[1:08:39] [Music]
[1:08:48] not because he was a republican but he
[1:08:50] says
[1:08:51] let me go down here because he was a
[1:08:52] godly man
[1:08:58] he was raised to serve god yes
[1:09:03] did you hear that
[1:09:05] this man abraham lincoln was raised
[1:09:08] somebody had raised the hebrews
[1:09:16] if there is anything that i want to
[1:09:18] praise uh to give praise to he said
[1:09:22] my life was influenced by
[1:09:25] a godly mother who told me to pray and
[1:09:28] to know jesus as my savior agamanti what

[2:02:23] higher than their pastor
[2:02:25] [Music]
[2:02:30] i'm
[2:02:30] assuming
[2:02:32] i kind of feel i'm about to finish by
[2:02:34] the way i'll just finish complete this
[2:02:36] subject later but i want i just feel to
[2:02:39] address this a little bit
[2:02:42] because
[2:02:46] brother can you find me the quote right
[2:02:48] quick
[2:02:53] in the message
[2:02:57] in the message pegaman church age
[2:03:01] you can either preach your brother you
[2:03:02] can get it
[2:03:06] it says
[2:03:07] the hidden manner emmanuel and
[2:03:10] a little something special what is
[2:03:12] special i can't trust
[2:03:14] you
[2:03:15] the blessings of the holy ghost
[2:03:18] the blessings of the holy ghost
[2:03:21] no
[2:03:22] that is for the whole congregation
[2:03:25] but the hidden manner name
[2:03:35] was a little more knowledge of the
[2:03:37] scripture
[2:03:40] that
[2:03:55] [Music]
[2:04:09] could teach others i suppose
[2:04:11] he's supposed to be are you know
[2:04:14] that way
[2:04:16] then he says this
[2:04:18] you will never leave no higher than your
[2:04:20] pastor joshua
[2:04:36] foreign to interpret this literally
[2:04:45] but i want you to see it in another way
[2:04:49] the pasta
[2:04:51] is the one with the hidden manner in a
[2:04:54] congregation
[2:04:58] why right because it's meant to be a
[2:05:00] teacher
[2:05:02] it's meant to be
[2:05:04] a guide
[2:05:12] no
[2:05:12] sheep can claim to be higher than the
[2:05:15] shepherds
[2:05:32] now what does the prophet mean here now
[2:05:34] together
[2:05:35] even in the message name of aka god
[2:05:38] blesses your pastor of that special
[2:05:39] revelation
[2:05:43] to be able to bless you
[2:05:46] you can't
[2:05:56] is not having it
[2:05:58] you won't have it either now it doesn't
[2:06:00] actually fall that's what it means
[2:06:02] church together that's why the shepherd
[2:06:07] will lead them to where are you they're
[2:06:09] blind leading they're blind
[2:06:14] they are in the denomination
[2:06:17] yes in our church there is women and
[2:06:18] preachers our pastors but it's okay for
[2:06:20] me i don't believe it
[2:06:26] but i don't believe it
[2:06:28] it's not right
[2:06:29] it is up to the church
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:33] you cannot be higher than that
[2:06:36] if your leaders are going to hell you
[2:06:38] are going to help too
[2:06:42] on
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:59] [Laughter]
[2:07:04] if you call me on the rapture morning
