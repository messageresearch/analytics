to lift up your name above all name we ask that you come Lord and take the the highest place in the name of Jesus as we now go into your word Lord consecrate us Lord let your word come and do the supernatural in Jesus name amen amen amen amen God bless you Church God bless you Church please be seated for just a moment I want to greet you in the precious name of Jesus [Applause] Christ thank you to all those that prayed for with us or for us rather when we were away for for the trip in Ethiopia uh uh God bless you so much the I was able by God's grace to give a report on Sunday uh on Wednesday last Wednesday so if you missed it you might want to go and check it out you might want to go and uh check it out on U on the on the YouTube so how many were able to watch the service those who are not here I see a few were able to watch that although it's been watched by many around the world but I encourage you to go and listen you know if I'm a part of a church I really want to know what God is doing I don't want to take the back bench I want to be on the Forefront when support is needed I want to give it in form of Prayer in the form of encouragement in form of um you know um money whatever it is I want to be there I would like to thank you all who have prayed for us some who sent us some messages encouragement some who you know have been you know supportive in other means the Lord has been good we had a very successful trip in Ethiopia amen and uh meanwhile we would like to bring greetings to you from Sister Dina uh from Boston part of this church team the services I believe she's even on now she has need for prayer she has I think a migrain or a headache needs go to visit her this several needs for prayers here also the sister Fe who is not here with us this morning uh she's um under expectation for a baby so let us remember I mean parents you know during this time it is a a very sensitive moment for both the mother the father and the whole family because you know giving birth is not easy it's a life and death situation so whenever we have a mother giving birth we usually want to cover them with our prayers as a church so whenever you really hear someone needs prayer please pray for them pray for them don't just take it serious and pray for them I know because I've gone through that with my wife and it has always been a very sensitive moment amen and also there's need for sister Esther who is also not here this morning she has need for prayer with her mother her mother is ill you know she lost her father not long ago and her mother has also been sick for a season and at this time I understand she's a bit e so let us remember Sister Esther and our mother in prayer amen so those are the prayer requests we we are going to pray for before we go to the word but I also have some good news sister Angela who is one of us here I think she's not been able to come to church yet God blessed her with a baby boy and uh she had a normal delivery and we really really thank God for that so if you know usually I want it to be the custom of the church whenever someone gives birth like sister phib here who recently gave birth who else gave birth recently there's I think another sister I don't see her here what's her name sister Sister Sister Linda Oh Sister Anita so she's not here I think right she recently gave birth uh my sister here gave birth before all of them so sister omet Ruth omet so I'm requesting whenever you hear mother's giving bir what you do I will tell you let us our custom get a gift and take it to if you can't go there at least send it you know show them love those are good things gifts from the Lord you know when Jesus was born they brought give gifts so when mothers give birth send them gifts to some of you I will tell you what you can send if you don't know you can send di that's that can be a wonderful gift I'm talking to you younger men who don't know and younger ladies those are very very good gifts so sister Angela is still at home baby send us some love you know when someone feels a part of a family it really encourages them amen receive greetings from um Brother Gary brother uh they traveled well after the successful uh mission trip we had in aasa they moved we all both came back Tois Ababa had a night there we had a few little fellowship with some brothers and then the following day I came to Uganda and they had to fly to austr so they had to arrive many many hours later but I heard that they both arrived well and we thank God for that there are many who were at brother brother Alan's introduction C yesterday no not yesterday was I say because we came back yesterday I was impressed by how many and those who were able to make it really God bless you uh M here was there sister M Sister Sister patience then I was so impressed to see sister daas all the way she came all from she was there and U brothera was there brother Dan was there brother praise praise uh who else yeah brother shalom shalom lift up your hand can see and uh yeah and Sister Sister Monica was also there by the way she sent greetings she's at speckled B today uh and yeah you did not lift up your hand and also brother Josh we had quite a number there representing DF and that was a very good thing I might have missed a few those who made it is not is not near and for your information those of you who went there that's where I I picked my wife so you can see how it is so it's a a sacrifice to go to such a journey but those who went and supported in various ways I'd like to say God bless you we also had some brothers also my wife of course was there and the family we had brothers from also evening light evening light uh brother ronal ronal and also uh we had um brother from uh what What's yeah brother Zava from and um another brother from um the Church of Pastor uh Daniel what is his name uh yes yes brother also his name is brother Dan and brother helped them with a car I understand so we appreciate all these people amen uh the wedding was slated for uh this coming Saturday I've heard rumors that they might want to change the dees but I think until it is confirmed we will be able to make the announcement amen but we are so thankful to what the Lord can do and I think there is no reason why they would want to change the wedding dates apart from lack of enough funds so if you want to to go to brother Alan and stand with that will be most appreciated shall we now stand and go to the scripture thank you musicians a subject that I have wanted to talk about for a while not too sure whether I am too ready for it but I just want to um uh see what the Lord will help us um Matthew 26 there is a family um here from I think is it brother brother Emanuel right and your wife is she around uh please join me to welcome them God bless you this is the their second time to fellowship with us and we certainly hope not their last we certainly hope not their last amen God bless you feel at home amen so we are reading out of Matthew 26 now since I want you to pray for me I'm tired like I said I did not expect that I would preach on Wednesday but I was shocked I shocked myself when I saw myself preaching so I think after this week weekend I don't know maybe I may have to go away for a few days I I said someone saying sure I think they'll sponsor us God bless you Matthew 26 ver 31 it's a long reading so we shall read a few verses and then sit let us first pray Lord Jesus we know how to read and we can read this uh text but we we do not know how to bring it to your people in a way that it can bring life to them I pray that you will Quicken our words and also our thoughts let it be your thoughts and your words Grant it I pray in Jesus amen amen then sayith Jesus unto them all ye shall be offended because of me this night for it is written I will Smite the shepherd and the she sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I am risen again I will go before you into Galilee okay uh Jesus um Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended because of thee yet will I not be offended Jesus said unto him verily I say unto thee that this night before the craw thou shal deny me Thrice Peter said unto him though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples amen we are going to read up to 75 we will do that when you are seated you can be seated but sh if you can give me a little more sound i' appreciate that you know I was speaking to a brother and he was saying even if it is not taken as an important thing but it is important for pastors to rest said because you cannot power out of an empty picture you occasionally need to rest a while just like you work in a day you work work work work and then you feel totally broken down you can't walk anymore so you want to go sleep when you wake up you feel energized again and you begin working in the next day so the same way uh we we always need to take some rest on and [Music] off especially when you burn out I can assure you if your preacher is very active and not burn out he can be more productive so I was meaning it when I said I'm planning to take some little rest so pray for me that that will be possible amen so this morning I want to speak on a subject a man under pressure I have always talked about this I usually have something here but I think dur theth um first of all before we go to the word I want to appreciate the brothers that ministered while I was away bless you uh we really appreciate you and you know being able to take to put your shoulders to the wheel amen all from the minister to the song leaders musicians you are all appreciated amen and to the people that supported the ministry as well you know friends we are not building a wall we are building a house and this house is going to be finished and we shall live in it amen both spiritually and physically yeah we are going somewhere we a Ministry that has a vision we are not just doing things because we believe we are doing things because we have a commission and we know where we are headed we headed to the rapture and we know while we are still here what we ought to do have many programs coming this but I'm just encouraging you that we should remain focused we should be focused to whatever we are doing brother I'm happy to see you brother Baka SE with your wife that is so lovely God bless you amen and so uh this subject is very important one to me and I believe it will be to you if the Holy Spirit can help us to get into the depth of it a man under pressure now um I have taken this text out of the Book of Matthew because this Book of Matthew here in this portion of it talks about you know the time when Jesus was going to H be killed it was a very wonderful moment when he was still picking his disciples it was a wonderful time when he was you know going around and preaching with them they saw the Miracles they saw the power the Saints and the Wonders and you know the ministry of Jesus was powerful how many agree with me that also the disciples he picked he picked those he knew he was picking for a purpose is that right you know did you even believe can you even believe that even Judas was picked for a purpose if Jesus picked you he picked you for a purpose but I want to be picked for a good purpose I don't want to be a Judas I want to be a Peter but even Peter had his ups and downs but I want us to examine the ministry and the life of Peter under pressure and also we look at the life and Ministry of Jesus under pressure and then we look at us under pressure when we are done with that then the service will be over go praise the name of the Lord and so we are now going to continue reading if you brother you can brother M if you can put it up for us here the scripture that be nice I'd like us to continue reading on up to vers 75 okay uh where did we stop do anybody remember 35 okay now shall we continue to 36 all right then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called now here we have seen you know Peter making a promise he said even if everybody forsakes you and they get offended at you you can count on me Peter be his CH said You I Will I Am with You amen and many of us can say the same about this message we can say the same about chist we can say the same about the convictions we have about life that's okay but wait when pressure comes that's when we can know what is happening all right I I I I want us to be ready for these things today because um you know um I'm going to talk about real things okay I don't want to talk about things which are in heaven when we are still on Earth so can we be real this morning church amen all right shall we continue now so then cometh Jesus with them unto a place called Gethsemane and sayith unto the disciples sit ye here while I go and pray Yonder and he took now I think it it will be okay shall we okay maybe I can just read in English because of time and then you will because we shall go through it again afterwards and he took him with him just read follow along there with me while I read and he took with him Peter and the two sons of zebede and began to be sorrowful and very heavy very heavy he was very heavy then said why was he heavy why was he heavy how ever felt heavy in their life you feel heavy you you are cut it's like as if you're cutting a heavy Lord you are under pressure you feel things are difficult you feel you cannot continue you feel if it is possible the ground should open up and swallow you you feel things are tough you are heavy okay this is Jesus has been there before are you not so glad we serve a God who has been in our situation and he knows what we feel and he feels what you feel and he says I understand so someone who understands is someone who can offer a solution a working solution because he has experienced everything we experience there is nothing no temptation that is higher that he has never experienced he he felt very heavy then he said unto them my soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death I'm so sorrowful to death imagine imagine that Jesus we worship once he was like that not because he was beaten not because anything had happened to him no but because something was about to happen and he did not know how to go through it he was under pressure and therefore he became so sorrowful he was very heavy he felt like dying I want you to imagine that Jesus felt like dying have you ever felt like that well don't lift up your hands some people but Jesus felt like dying in other words in our normal language I feel I'm sick and tired sick and tired just want to die and Away Jesus felt like that and so he told his disciples here and watch with me stand with me stand with me I can't be alone the savior of the world he felt he needed help he need people to stand with him stand with him even Jesus needed enage amen have you ever been in that condition where you feel you don't need criticism but you need encourag us at this time he left all the other disciples he took only the ones you could trust that these ones are not judgmental these ones can understand and can stand with me this is a realistic point of view here and he went a little further and he fell on his face and prayed saying oh my father for it be possible let disc compass from me nevertheless not as I will but as thou will he prayed and he cometh unto the disciples and he find them asleep and said unto Peter what could you not watch with me one hour he found a disciples sleeping the ones he expected he will confide in by the way don't over spiritualize this Jesus was a man like you 100% not 99% not 50% 100% thank and this is how he fa he took some brothers his brothers to stand with him and instead of praying with him help Jesus help our brother streng him they went to bed and they slept so woke up out of prayer what you couldn't even watch with me pray with me for even one [Music] hour very discouraging isn't it you know at a time when the pressure is up that's when everything will discourage you that's when you feel everybody is seeing you as a useless person am I talking to rocks or you ever been have you ever been in that situation where you feel you need to be massaged encourage someone who should come and say brother you but everybody who comes what is wrong with you you have a problem this is how Jesus felt now you say let me go to fasting and prayer let me take brother Di and brother Julius to help you reach Church they they sleeping see brother you can't stand with me the situation was very intense he was under pressure watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is willing he went away again the second time and prayed saying oh my father if th if this cup may not pass if this cup may not pass away from me except I drink it thy will be done and he came and found them asleep again for their eyes were heavy when you are under pressure that's when even your eyes will become heaven the eyes of those who are supposed to help you will become heavy can't see that I need help you can't see that I need encouragement but they don't see you and he left them he left them and went away again and prayed a third time saying the same words amen then cometh he to his disciples and said unto them sleep sleep on now sleep on now the third time when he came back he told them now continue sleeping sleep on now brother I don't know what's happening to this uh speaker you will have to work on it all right thank you he says sleep on now and take your rest behold the hour is at hand and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of the Sinners Brethren usually you don't pray when you are going through a problem you should pray before the problem comes you should always have a vision see what is coming and prepare yourself for it before it comes because after it has come that what you think is prayer is not prayer it is just desperation but you see real prayer comes before the problem the problem should come after prayer and here Jesus was praying and you know because he knew what was coming he was under intense pressure come let us pray wake up let us pray wake up don't enter Temptation and then what happened they just slept they just slept the second time so after he knew it had been done he told him now continue sleeping don't need to pray the thing has already been done rise let us be going behold he is at hand that do betray me and while he yet spake L Judas one of the 12 came and with him a great multitude with swords and staves from the chief priests and Elders of the people now he that betrayed him gave them a sign saying whomsoever I shall kiss that same is he hold fast and forth with he came to Jesus and said hail master and kissed him and Jesus said unto him friend whereof Thou come then came they and laid hands on Jesus and took him and behold one of them which were with Jesus stretched out his hand and Drew his sword and struck a servant of the highest Priestess and smart of his ear then said Jesus unto him put up again thy sword into his place for all they that take the sword Shall Perish with the sword thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my father and he shall presently give me more than 12 Legions of angels some people have missed this portion Jesus was under what that is 10% of you Jesus was under what Breen pressure and then a brother you know sometimes when you are under pressure and you have a huge problem some people think they actually helping you but by helping you they actually destroying you here a brother pulls out a SW and cuts off the ear of the enemies but Jesus said no no no no no no take back your sword don't you know that my father is able oh my God may God reveal this to us today my father is able to send Legions of angels more than 12 Legions he is able to send them now to come and fight for me but why did he send because God wanted Jesus to be under pressure because he wanted him to be tested he wanted him to be tried because he was beating him out so that character can come out sometimes God let things happen to us not because is not able to help us God is more than able God is more than there is nothing he cannot do he watches every time he sees what happens to you he knows what happens to you during day during night during every time when you are in your Valley when you are in your mountain when you are anywhere knows and our God sees but why does he watch because he wanted that pressure to come that pressure must be it is his will but he's able that one comforts me Jesus knew he was not presuming he was not spiritualizing the situation he knew my father is by let me tell you brethren no matter what situations we go on in life we must always have that attitude that God is able to do the import hallelujah amen God is able to do the God has never been unable He's Able He's Able there is nothing he can fail to do he can do anything he can do everything but why is it that sometimes he doesn't do it it is his will amen after all the prayers stand still because when you stand still you are showing you know who your father is if you know the will of God for anything in your life don't let anyone talk you out of am I preaching to someone don't let anyone talk you out of the will of God there is the will of man there is the will of God the will of man shall fail the ways of man shall fail but the will of God is permanent and can never fail sometimes the will of God does not look like the will of God because the will of God is harder the will of God is difficult the will of God is usually very very difficult to go through but to a Believer I said who a belever we are believers in we are believers anyway no matter what happens we are believers we are called to believe that our father is able to send angels to come and take us out of this situation SRA M and they knew the will of God the will of God was do not bow do not bath no matter how hot the fire is it was the will of God didn't they know it they knew it but when the fire becames hotter they even gave them another chance they said okay maybe it was a mistake for you to disobey the words of the let us give you another chance when you hear the drums and you hear the music and you hear the timbr and everything bow and that music was not the music Believers are supposed to hear we should different oh my god listen church we must differentiate loud sounds with the music of the Holy Ghost the music of the Holy Ghost always agrees with the word but loud sound come from the devil and his associates discourage from going into the will of God and they beat all the music and the sound and everything and then you see people many of them were Believers by the way many of them were Believers of them were believer who were now in Babylon you see but now when they other the music all of them began dancing you are poor you accept it yes you are nothing you accept yes you cannot do it you accept yes you are like the rest of them you yes no matter what God say but you look at the life the things of life you accept it yes and they bowed so what are you going to do everyone does what everyone borrows I'll borrow everyone sells what they have to get what they need I also do what are they doing they dancing to the tune of the devil's music because everyone sees it that way everyone believes it that their eyes are fixated on the so called realities of life but a Believer has a different reality a Believer listens to a different sound the sound of the promises of God word the sound of the word what what God says that will always be the truth let every man's word be a li let God his word be the what did God say you are the heads not the Tails so I am not poor don't you see the reality no I'm not dance we have to come to that place where we will tell the devil we will not dance we will not dance your dance your tune don't you see you are sick sister Diana don't you see you're blind you tell the devil I will not dance I am not blind don't you see it is the reality no I will not dance I see something else I hear a different sound don't you see you have no T I will not dance don't you see you can't get married I will not dance you can't get a husband no I will not dance I am hearing a different sound these brothers they knew something the devil did not know brother Marvin these brothers had met God they had character they knew that they knew God is faithful even if the fire burns there they knew still he is faithful they were ready to die a Believer is like a mad person you are ready to die you do things which are Beyond Reason now you know why brother Bram said they will call you a they will call you a nut they will call you AUD they will call you you know what is this other word you know like you you're so you that's a very good they call you a fanatic you know someone who is fanatical who is seeing the fire but he is refusing to Bow you you a you are stupid can't you see the fire it will burn you said no he said he will be with me he is with me now for sure we want to have you know this fire is real your God is here I don't care I am ready to burn if you not ready to burn you are not a True Believer a True Believer should be ready to [Applause] burn order to stand with God meaning a True Believer believes the word regardless of the situation a True Believer stands with God's word regardless of the circumstances what is God's word God's word is the truth God's word is the will of God when you know the will of God you don't care about what anyone else is saying am I preaching to a Believer today you stand with God's word if you don't sign here never get a job if the Holy Spirit and the conviction of God in you says no stand with your conv everybody does it I will have you no friends I am not everyone I am not everybody I Will Not Bow I will not Bend I will believe in that I know he's able to send Legions Jesus said like that so Jesus knew the three Hebrew children knew not they presumed they thought they knew God is able to save but there is something a Believer there is something you get within you that gives you listen a piece Beyond Reasonable Doubt that God is faithful now when you have that piece it is tangible no one can see it you two can see it but you can feel it it's a conviction that's why faith is personal we cannot have Collective Faith you must have faith to believe in in God for your desires you as an individual Jesus said he's able my father is able to present presently not in the future now present is able to give me more than 12 Legions but how then shall the scripture be fulfilled that thus it must be in that same hour Jesus said to the multitudes are ye come out as against a thief with swords and with stabes and for to take me I sat daily with you teaching in the temple and he laid no hold on me but but all this was done that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled that that then all the disciples forsook him and fled amen what I'm hearing I feel that when I speak them they don't come out listen care I'm not saying I know you are listening with your ear but I want you to open your spiritual listen this was done that the scriptures might be fulfilled the disciples they couldn't understand why Jesus had to accept I believe most of them believe that is powerful and indeed he was they believed Supernatural they had seen certain things in his ministry they had seen him heal the sick they had seen him deliver the bound you know the lamb would walk you know the Sinners were for they had seen lives change they had seen the Mad people coming now these people came listen Church they came to a place whereby they now believe this man can do anything anything they had seen they had tested and they knew that the Lord they never expected him to submit to this problem told it is the will of God and they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away that's why when they saw this they ran away they took off they took off but remember there is one who had promised he will be with him praise the name of the Lord we shall see also about him where Brethren follow me get get in your Bible why I'm reading so you read or else you will sleep be proactive be in the service don't just sit and listen with me follow this is the Bible this is the word of God we want to be connected to the supernatural I see people's minds here and there let bring your mind together read your Bible with me amen Shalom shom all right so which verse are we on thank you I know you're following and they that had laid hold on Jesus led him away to caas the high priest where the scribes and the elders were assembled but Peter followed him a far off unto the high priest's Palace and went in and sat with the servants to see the end now the chief priests and elders and all the councel sld false witness against Jesus to put him to death but found none yeah though many false Witnesses came yet found they none at last came two false Witnesses and said this fellow I said I am able to destroy the temple of God and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it that thou which these things witness against thee but Jesus held his peace remember this is a man under what and the high priest answered and said unto him I adjo Thee by the Living God that thou tell us whether thou be the Christ the son of God Jesus said unto him thou has said nevertheless I say unto you Hereafter When shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the Clouds Of Heaven and then the high priest ran his cles saying he has spoken blasphemy what father need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death then did was he guilty of death was he church yet they said he was it doesn't matter what they say tell your neighbor it doesn't matter what they say it does not matter what they say it matters What God Says then did then did they spit in his face and buffeted him and others smot him with the palms of their hands saying prophesy unto us thou Christ who is he that smart thee now sat without in the palace and AD damel came unto him saying thou also was with Jesus of Galilee but Peter who had said he will be with him W now looked at this damsel when she came to him and he said he denied before them all saying I know not what thou sayest and when he was gone out into the porch another maid saw him and said unto them that were were there this fellow was also with Jesus of Nazareth and and again he denied with an O I do not know the man with an oath with an oath and after after a while came unto they uh that stood by and said unto Peter surely thou surely surely thou also are one of them for thy speech betray the then began he to Cur to C oh my God we see you are speaking like a Believer the way you are dressing the way you are speaking you are like one of them those people there the and then he said let me prove to you I'm not one of them he began cing andar a brother a Believer he wanted to prove the world he's not one of them then began he to Cur and to swear saying I know not the man and immediately the crew and Peter remembered the words of Jesus which he said unto him before the C crew Thou shalt deny me Thrice and he went out and wept bitterly amen now that was our reading so if you can give me one hour to preach to you that will be fine now look at these two men Jesus before dur before and during the pressure and then Peter before and during the pressure brother B the church he said as job said he put strength in US you see he himself suffered he learned obedience by the things which he had suffered he's talking about Jesus he was actually made perfect by the things which he suffered Hebrews 58 though he were a son yet he learned obedience by the things which he suffer and being made perfect he became the author of Eternal salvation and to all of them that obey him that's why according to what I preach on Wednesday the Believers of this message don't follow a man or man we follow the word and the Holy Ghost we obey the word the man is speaking according to the word obey him if the man is speaking according to his ideas then you know what to follow follow the word follow the Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit cannot say anything away from the word praise the the name of the Lord in a plain language the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering amen and according to Paul he was left he has left his church a measure of suffering that they they too by their faith in God while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this James 1:2 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse tempations no this that the trying of your faith work patience but let patience have her perfect work may be perfect and entire wanting nothing amen count it all joy tell your neighbor count it all joy brother it's not always going to be easy it's not always going to be easy if you hear a preacher telling you it's going to be easy he a liar that's why there are songs we don't sing as [Music] Believers going to heaven have you heard of that song before we don't sing that song is a lie of the devil that's why they tell them if you're poor it means you're C if things are not wealth means you that's a lie of the devil you can be very poor and yet saved going to heaven it is true it is possible and how can you come out of poverty by working not praying hard can I preach the word this morning dvf members if you are lazy and you don't want to work and you don't want to find a job life will always be hard for you it is a truth praise the Lord come I think that is better Pastor today you preaching hardship and suffering I'm guiding you according to the word you have to find jobs you younger men you have to find jobs you have to think God gave you a head this head here I'm talking about young men I'm trying to be decent but I'm being if you are young 25 and below and you are jobless touch your head right now your I'm seeing some of them not touching their head tell yourself this head you not saying what I'm saying this head God gave it to you to reason to work the faculty the mind has a lot of strength and abilities but you must think you must use it don't sleep tell yourself where come from you see you must work up find money money won't find you the blessing of God maketh Rich how does he make you rich he not talking about money there he's talking about the riches in Christ that's what he's talking about that's the truth many times you look at it as if it's meaning money no someone can be totally poor but yet having the riches in Christ and to be poor is a choice it's not that God made you to be poor no it's a choice you can choose to be poor or choose to be rich well you may never be rich rich rich but you cannot be a beggar because God has given you everything you need to be what you want to be hallelujah amen I actually believe some of us would have been millionaires I mean all my brothers a millionaire and I think I'm Sher than most of them I'm looking at that because my mom is there but but we chose to serve God some of us we decided to go into Ministry fully but also minist we are successful we are not failur no we are not amen so whatever you decide to do with all your accept Pros God wants you to prosper but some of you are refusing you just want to always be there pitting yourself God wants you to prosper accept it of you must leave this church Sunday morning you go look for job how can you be 25 and you are still asking food from your father from your mother it is a shame it's a shame it is a shame my mother is say if I she will lift up a hand I left a house when I was 13 years 13 10 + 3 and I started Living with the bishop I left him when I was 15 I started Living with Pastor Le I left I left his house when I was 16 17 and from 17 years I have lived on my own and I never fornicated and I never stole and I never beg but I used to work with my hands using the head the Mind God gave me until later on goded me and called me to Ministry what I'm saying there is nothing impossible to a Believer but now no matter your situation God has said count it all Jo when you enter into diverse Temptation knowing this the trying of your faith work patience let patience have her perfect work so you see all of us shall be tried but this is not equals to poverty someone can be very rich and tried in other areas although here in Africa when we talk about suffering we always think about poverty but here God is Not meaning poverty someone it may be sickness and it is a big problem to someone it might be you know something else family problem maybe it's your cross to carry maybe your parents abandon when you're so young and it's a cross to carry to some of you it's something else but each of us has a cross to car that's why he says carry your cross and follow Christ why does it take away all the problems he lets the pressure come so can reveal what man of person you are you see he wants to mold a certain character out of us and listen without being born again without being filled with the Holy Ghost it is impossible for you to take that trial and testing positive you'll just dismiss yourself and dismiss God and say I think God doesn't love me he has not blessed me like so and so you know but but if you born again and you are in the middle of your fire you will know that you know that you know the Holy Ghost gives you this understanding that I know who I am when you know who you are when you know you are born you are a son of God then you understand and accept correction you accept correction you accept test and tri and you go through them joyfully without without weing in your faith we want to buy our church land since we started doing the pledges doing this doing that they have come hiccups downs and ups but we know as a church colle we know if the lordes we must buy it let me tell you there is nothing that will happen that will make me shift my mind on nothing even if the Bank closed and all the money we have is lost start over what I'm trying to say if you know that you know this is the vision the goal God has given to you to accomplish another person will not help you to achieve it it is you the owner of that Vision you as a man as an individual you have to take initiative to stand and to believe you have to have a backbone amen when when had a back says Adam knew what he was doing what did he do he ran to her yet you would have just run away from her you would have said that's what you have done okay that's up to you me I am a right Son of God I will not engage in this but he said my wife I am your savior oh Hallelujah the Bible says Jesus he is the savior of the body he is Our Redeemer he is our savior that's why in the same way a man redeems his wife you know says in one part that you man has you know Mercy on the woman and chooses her for wife just like Jesus had mercy on us if a man finds a man playing around with his wife he just give him a knock out punch says leave my wife alone are you hearing what I'm saying if you want to test me try it on my wife that's when you will know okay let me leave that area what I'm saying in the same way Jesus fights for his the savior of of praise the name of the Lord so what am I saying are you following me you have to know who you are regardless of the pressure a man's character is known by his works in the infalible word of God a prophet says and a man's character is shown in his works his character by his works we know that just like a contractor shows what he is by his work [Music] for instance if we was going to have a great building built here in the city of Chicago the first thing the officials of the City Board would do they would try to select a contractor just not anyone that run in and said well I can do the job all right they're going to get a contract that's got a reputation and now because if they didn't maybe another contractor would underbid that contractor but he would put it in the building and bad material and perhaps he would build it thousands of dollars less another one and then we could come to find out that the building collapsed the first storm hit it it went down the storm the storm what do you think the city would think about that contract it would ruin his reputation over it would ruin his reputation he says forever are you following me how do you know a man by his what by his what praise the name of the Lord there's something I did not put up in my notes but I felt like reading it to you and I think that every Christian ought to take the same attitude we want to know where we are standing we don't want our Eternal destination built upon the shifting sons of some church but on the etal word of the living because remember every one of you sitting here tonight so many times is going to that building you are setting death is going to strike You' better know what kind of sun it is built upon oh what kind of foundation it has God building the Foundation he would not put nothing else but the best that there is because God is thoughtful of his reputation he's a god of Eternity he's a god of heavens and earth he will never put nothing in his act plan but what will stand the test of time for eternity we would praise the name of the Lord now what building has it built what building has it built am I preaching to people I am that building everybody say I am that building Say by Revelation now church I believe I am that building and if I'm not building God is building me and he built me from before the foundation of the world and he laid the foundation properly let me say this God doesn't start to [Music] fail that's that's that was striking God doesn't start to fail [Music] he's the he's the Alpha and Omega when he starts he does what who am I I'm a building of God I may not be perfect yet he is working on me but he's not going to f the moment he started he started on me he must accomplish everything I was meant to be but I will tell you what I was not meant to be I was not meant to be a failure I was not meant to be a beggar I was not meant to be you know one of these cheap people let me announce to you I am not cheap you are not cheap no you are not whatever God Invision you to be is what you are not what somebody else said you would be but what God said that's why when Temptation comes to me I jack up my head I say I am not that I cannot stoop so long I Am What God envisioned me to be whatever you envision me that I must be because God is a god of Eternity amen hallelujah hallelujah I am not preaching about someone else I'm preaching about you I'm preaching about me praise God a man's character is shown in his works God is character God character he shown his work I am the work of God you got it I am the work of God and the way I'm going to end up will show God his character but I'll tell you what God is God is not a failure God is all powerful God does the impossible God is faithful God never fails God is ever present in the time of trouble God knows my needs when everybody fails to understand God understands me that's what my God is and because I know I am a work of God all those character istics of God must be revealed through me the word should see me and say you are a citizen of another country you are doing things differently how did you do it the way believers do our businesses must be different everybody does witchcraft to make it work I believe praise and pays their TI and it works the way we do our weddings everybody says can you have a wedding without dancing music but a Believer does it is different is different why because we are the character of God now let me take it now as we begin to descend in church age why does he stand by God stands by when he sees a suffer he leaves us in our pressure and he stands by and watches Romans 8:17 he says this and if children then we are hairs I am an hair hairs of God joint ha with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together for I Rec that the sufferings the suffer of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reain with him you have to suffer to rain tell that to your neighbor you have to suffer to rain you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering have you got it that's why God allows us to suffer is molding a character if you ask you said Daddy I want a phone Daddy I want a phone Daddy I want a Bible before you even finish Daddy I want something else because you know whenever I ask he provid you even sing songs about it Jehovah so we believe whenever we ask now what the mentality you have is the mentality of the [Music] Millennium and it's okay but you have to understand while you are still here on Earth there is another aspect why we to be like that in the Millennium because we already have character we will be asking for the right things but here we are all sort of we have foolishness in our head the Bible says foolishness is bound up in the heart of a child the road of Correction will drive it out so now we are who children foolishness is bound up in the of our child so we are children being that we are children yes of course we are hairs but before we become you have to be corrected you have to be child trained if child of God be from every now and then you will let those things happen to you tough situation and pressure builds up what can I do can I disappear imagine if you had the power you're going to have in the and when you see a problem disappear and you disappear because we shall be appearing and disappear so God knows if we have that here now many of you will not receive this character many of us so you would say father I need a you pull out your hand you be I need a phone I need Jesus prayed how many times three times was his prayer answer three times and the B says each time he pray the same words because the need was the same and each time it was not answered and after he prayed then the need was not granted but I'll tell you something else his will God's will was being done and as God he was able to know as as a man listen church as a man listen listen as a man he was here praying But as God he was seeing what where Judas is and then after praying three times as a man as God is so now my will is done they are coming told them get up get up get get now if you want you can sleep stop praying let us go because they think the time is now that was not a man speaking that was God speaking and all of us have a man part and a god [Applause] part all of us because we are Sons like he is a son we are hairs like he is a hair we are joint hairs with Jesus and if he suffered we have to suffer if we prayed and answered prayers we would have some of them too he was under pressure he felt like dying he felt like flying away we will feel the same way through it all like he was we should be standing firm in the promises of God knowing is faithful amenu and here you see unless we suffer with him we cannot re with him you have to rain to suffer you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I said Hallelujah when I was getting married I told my mother I was 19 I was in university and I felt like I want to get married and go into Ministry it was a difficult decision to me I prayed and prayed and prayed and God made me know I had to do it you see when you have a conviction a personal conviction from God it's the leadership of the spirit you don't care what anybody says that's why I understand some of you say Pastor that is your story we also have ours it is true each of us have our own story and each of us has our own personal relationship and walk with the Lord we are not here to become like your pastor like our Prophet we are here to become like Jesus praise God at least each of us can identify our situations in the life and Ministry of Jesus and my mother said I will put you down and you she's here she said I was so sad that she could not see what I was saying but that was my personal walk she's a good mother she raised us to be responsible C go to school finish school get a job but somehow I was seeing something else and I had to own [Music] you have to see or rather have a vision for your life as an individual God used your mother and your father to get into this world but they can never take care of you forever they can never lead you forever they guide you forever they are there to help raise you and a child can a parent can raise a child maybe for the first Maximum 20 years of their life after that you are someone's background you are someone's background that's the truth then you have to for your own life if you read the life story of brother Bram parents were so young Ella and whoever and and you know they they they were I think 16 and 17 and they had about you know more than I think seven children a big number there and U and um these children all were raised by these young people and their mother their father their father was his father was a drunker and he Wasing alcohol so he was Raising that of family but when he became of age when did he become of age for God to be able to trust him anyone knows the age seven how old are you do you know the vision of God for your life but got to know his vision received it at s years that's when the angel of the Lord came and told him the purpose why he was born Never Smoke never drink never defile your body in any way there is a work for you to do when you get older from that age he had a sudden relationship with God 10 20 he grew he went on he even join a denomination Baptist Church but right there God will still meet him he himself had to make his choice to either stand the Baptist Church God never came down and told him hey move away from here no God never does things like that do you know why there some people have met who have wrong Spirits thinking they have a spirit of God it's um religious Spirits enticing Spirits they said they don't do anything unless God tells them they think it's a spirit of God but it is not these are people brother would you please come and we have a Bible study I have to first listen to the other day I gave one of them a book a message book told them brother CU I felt they needed it said go read it he said after a while he called me now the Holy Spirit has told me not to read it he has told me only to stick and read the [Music] Bible yes think about it it's not the holy spirit it's an enticing Spirit which think makes You Think You Are Holy you don't need to hear from God on everything you do if that is so then we are dummies it doesn't have its own will it goes whever the owner takes it we are not that way God created us to be another God like him to have our own will no creature is like us we have the power of fre [Music] agency no one should dictate your life gave you the testimon EP against everyone's advice even me I could not sincerely advise him to do what he did because I know the Holy Spirit sometimes leads people differently I did not advise him against it he made up his mind to move from his the comfort of his home man about 1920 leave his parents leave a place where he could get a good job and earn good money go all the way into another city which is Lesser City of the other he cannot get a good job but he said apparently that God had laid him there to do the work of the ministry so he called me up he said pastor do you support me I said I have to bring it in such a way it doesn't come out as if I'm the one who told him to go but I also have to bring it in such a way that I'm not I'm not unsupportive so I told him is God leading you to go said oh yes spoke a few word there I said one more question I said is it your your choice or someone is pushing he said it's my choice God is leading me to do it I said then I'm 100% behind you saw on Wednesday how much I I I I nearly cried when I saw orders about more than 10 preachers some old enough to be his grandfather some are Bishops in the denominational church he the young man baptized why and he has several churches all under his ministry I couldn't believe my eyes like I couldn't believe my eyes but where did this come from from a choice from a decision friends we are independent human beings that God has to independently work on our character to mold us but even then we are supposed to make decisions [Music] about our life using the power of free moral agents turn to your neighbor tell them you must be a decision maker some people fear making decisions because they fear the outcome I don't fear outcomes of my decision even in decision has outcomes so make a decision on how you want your life to be or where you want to go never allow anyone to make a decision for you and especially when you are under pressure because you see pressure many times will make you make wrong decisions sometimes you angry I shouldn't have bat him I'm sorry the damage has already been C am I preaching to someone I will finish now but give me 20 more minutes you have to suffer to rain the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't rain because power apart from character is satanic power apart from character is satanic power apart from character is satanic a man without character is not fit to rain but yet we are created to be what God bless you Kings and Priests I am a king king over what king in my own territory I rule over demons I rule over spirits and I rule over my life I do not allow the enemy to take me where I don't want to go you know brother brother Gary had an accident and you know he lims so we were somewhere and uh you know there were two options I told him brother let us go to the escalator no he said no no no I have to use the stairs and I said why he said because I have to tell this body who is in control brethren we have to tell the devil who is in control we have to tell ourselves who is in control do not allow the devil and the body to dictate what you should do sometimes you are under pressure from your body to do something but you have to tell your body look I am a king I have to rule over you but you cannot do that without character to get character you cannot pray oh God give me character God gives you character through suffering if you're suffering with something right now God is going to lift you up God is going to promote you why promotion comes through suffering power with character is fit to rule and since we he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and he sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him what is to overcome to overcome is to suffer and then leave after the suffering some of you your sufferings are more than others sometimes you even wonder who chicken I am I suffering more don't brother is preparing something for you the you suffer God lifts you up because after suffering there is raining hallelujah amen oh my listen church he wants us to sit with him and a little temporary suffering we got through now is not worth to be compared to the trem Glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up oh the treasure that are laid up for those who are willing to enter into the his kingdom through much tribulation think it not strange concerning the fear Tri that are to try you that is what Peter said is it strange that God wants to us to develop a Christlike character that come through suffering no it is not and we all have trials the one who doesn't have trials lift up your sometimes you can even say God let this thing go and God said no not yet oh God I do I thought I was filled with the Holy Ghost yes you are filled with the Holy Ghost and actually after being filled with the Holy Ghost that's When Trials increase they iny Temptations increase the moment they entered into the Promised Land the battles started but I'll tell you what they that overcome reign in that promised land they took portions of their land some of you God is just getting ready to hand you over your portion don't give up don't give up because God is getting ready to hand you over your portion in this life and in the Life to Come amen amen praise the Lord the church that is not suffering when I read this I ched the church that is not suffering and is he's not tried hasn't got it it is not of God M okay who is not suffering here the ones who are not suffering will not lift up it's not of God everybody has their own cross to carry way every one of us has a cross to car carry your cross with joy serve god with understanding stand still no you cannot fail as long as you do not decide to get over to to get it done and leave [Music] it don't put your equipments down let's keep fighting let's keep walking we have to do know the will of God we are not praying for it we know it I know it was the time I told my mom when she said those words pressure came over me but I I kept on pushing I don't know what made her but later on she is one of the persons that really supported me more than anyone she ried her people because all her relatives have some money so we came together and gave me money and I had my ceremony and for 12 years I've been enjoying life with my precious [Music] wife but if I had submitted under that pressure Where is the Elizabeth set up she will not be here pressure a man pressure the display of character and pressure when we I've seen several scenarios of pressure God has given me the grace to see [Music] them but I I'll give you three of them in this few remaining Mees you don't mind this do you is that okay now Steven is one of them Steven the B I'll read portion for you here when they heard these things they were cut to their heart and they nashed on him with their teeth but he being full of the Holy Ghost looked up steadfastly into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing on the right hand of God and said behold I see the heavens opened and the son of man standing on the right hand of God then they cried then then they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their eyes and ran over him with one Accord and cast him in out of the city and stuned him and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet whose name was Saul and they stuned steeven calling upon God saying Lord Jesus receive my spirit and he kneel down and cried with a loud voice Lord let not this sin to the church and when he had when he had said this he fell asleep now this portion is very interesting this is a man who had character this man had gone through it he suffered for the cause of Christ and he reached this moment when they're going to kill him and you know what he accepted to be stoned he not fight them he accepted it he said but I know the will of God I rather die for and you know when he he saw he saw what they could not see Hallelujah amen I'll tell you what he saw he saw God standing the son of man standing on the right hand of God let me tell you this in all these other scriptures the Bible shows him sitting by did you ever realized that s but here he saw him standing what do you think he was standing he was standing because of what his son was doing he had submitted himself for the cause of Christ and accepted to suffer for the cause of Christ so much that Christ was so moved and he got up from wherever he was sitting and he stood up you know what they call standing when does something is notal stand God stood up because a son had accepted to suffer for the cause of Christ God stood up Steven accepted to go under through the the pressure and his reaction to this pressure was very very excellent ask you what's your reaction to your pressure you know I was I read this for brother W some years ago and whenever I talk about it he laughs so I hope he doesn't laugh today you know brother bam say something very interesting Hallelujah in the message of the mighty conqueror if if there is anything that makes a Christian lazy is when you are on a flowered bed of EAS we don't want it persecution enough we don't have it hard enough always at the chain is the strongest at it we weakest link listen to this here it is a man under pressure is what he is when he is under pressure God bless you brother but let pressure come now we have known you now we have known his real true characteristics will show when he is under pressure get him all Reed and stand up then you will see the real man [Music] coming and I'm preaching to you [Music] and I've not ended my sermon yet and before I finish this quot I'm not ending so if you planning to hate me you can start now but I know most of you will love me anyhow get him ready up get him St up then he will see the man come you know you see some Believers so Believers having disappointments disagreements rather that's when you you get to see people and say are believers you see someone becoming very no no no no we are not going to be played with we have to show you and shs will be all and they will begin bringing f the truth I'm talking the [Music] truth baranda praise God simply because people had misunderstandings people don't agree and then you show the colors of the person coming out I want to nail this properly and finish with we don't want to see you as a brother when everything is okay maybe before someone is annoyed I don't know them but when pressure comes on them then I've beg to know them I watch how you react when you begin removing the clothes they are red eyes the fists then I know oh a man under pressure Jesus was under pressure he felt everything we feel what did he do he prayed that's what a Believer oughts to do when your back is against the wall when you are confused when you heart broken when you under immen pressure when you feel like dying go in prayer someone writes you a message you look like a God let me show them pray I assure you by the time you come out of that prayer you will not answer him or you look like a sheep some say sheep ship is ship we are all sh it's no if you call him a sheep when he's a person is an abuse also if he's got temper it will show itself if he's meak and gentle it will show itself put him under pressure once and God puts his children under test to see whether there is any flows in them pressure are you one of them so happy and but let pressure come what are you say me I don't know the man brother we saw you I swear I don't know the man leave me alone but Peter your speech betrays you you speak like them okay let me I told you know leave me alone and they speak all bad words maybe it's not is right right pressure pressure without the Holy Ghost you canot submit to pressure the right way and Peter was like that but when he met him amen he was molded he got character next time they came and they said you guys are drunk Peter get up he said no we are not drunk with wine in excess but we are filled with the Holy Ghost where did the boldness come from to stand for the truth brother stand for the truth even when you are under pressure stand for your convictions even when you are Under Pressure stand for what you believe even when you are under pressure and God will always bless you if you are under pressure and for what you believe let off that pressure everybody is guilty of it says I'm guilty also you all guilty we do things under pressure we wouldn't do do otherwise your wife your husband angers you just bring out something and many of us don't even have that nature of going to say I'm [Music] sorry a man under pressure is who he is whatever is in there will come out and that's why God let pressure happen separate young men from big men who is going to stand who is going to accept pressure and accept to be molded David under went the same pressure I will not qu any inel talks about him David you know the he was hiding somewhere in the cave and the man of sa told him oh we know where your enemies so they came to hunt for David and also the men of David told him oh David the scriptures fulfilled where God said he will put your enemy in your hands it has been fulfilled your enemy soul is coming so when he did like this he saw him he picked out his knife some piece of the SK and David I mean s did not even know he Hur his [Music] enemy but after he did it because he was a man of character he felt [Music] said God I'm sorry who am I to do this to your anointed you know the spirit of rumor mongering rumors and um and you know speaking things about others gossip works the same way if you don't have character you participate in Gossip because you don't have character if you have character the spirit of God will SM oh I'm sorry because you have character that's why God allows us to go through the things we go to mold that character in us I could preach for more one more hour but I'll end it here God bless you [Applause] shall we stand up on our feet we sing Lord prepare me to be a sanctuary Lord prepare me to be a

to God lord Jesus we have seen many examples in your word many of your children who were under pressure Peter Paul and we have also talked about the three Hebrew children David many of these examples we have before us some of them and many of them did not manage pressure well but Lord we have learned today about Jesus how is a man under pressure he was able to be in control he was in control of his flesh he was control of his ego he was control even as he said my father is able to send a legion 12 Legion from Heaven ofel oh how Lord we know that you can help us in an En lightening fles and you send a legion of angels from heaven but many times you don't do that because you want to see our reaction like you spoke to the prophet you said son of man can these bones live again you wanted
