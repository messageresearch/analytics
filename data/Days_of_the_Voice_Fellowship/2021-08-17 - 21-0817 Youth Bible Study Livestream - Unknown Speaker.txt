something with you if indeed you have traveled for a long time down on a road that probably was lonely in your life without somebody to comfort you without jesus who would be your comfort that your heart was heavy you sat you sunk low in sin and then if you need it is through your heart of jesus you heard of this message if indeed it is true these things happen to you i'm talking to you each of you that is here you cannot sing it the way you're seeing it if indeed these things are true even if you are hearing this song for your first time you can't sing it the way you're singing something is definitely wrong i'm in a room which seems as if we have old people here this is a room of young people you're all young all of you are young and strong and healthy if the devil is binding you kick him out the bible says where the spirit of god is there is brother help me where the spirit of god is what is there bro what does the scripture say you want to help us does anybody know what the

what do you do brother yeah that's what i'm looking for brother when the cloud moves you move with a cloud hallelujah oh no maybe there is a cinema manga someone can say what what does that have to do with it it is good that if there is a sinner among us or sinners let them come god loves them then you can deliver you can one can usually deliver everybody who is bound in this place but if you act like you're about yourself there is no freedom anywhere how many agree with me hallelujah how many want to sing this song with all their strength all their youthful strength amen someone doesn't have a terror you stand up and let us sing stand up and let us see you you feel it in your bones brother hallelujah you feel in your body by the solomon hallelujah whereby you stand up with all your

how far are you when i say that when i i how far are you where which chapter were you on can i have my chat alpha which chapter were you on okay so john you need to unmute yourself so we can hear you otherwise we can't hear okay you can now talk how far are you when i save it sorry okay if you can hear us then you will need to just stay in the chat because you can't see what i'm saying a sound is distorted because of your connection i don't know why these days your connection is not good so you need to let me mute you here you need to simply chat send a text on the chat there let me know which chapter you are on by the time you started we started asking people to read so we can know whether you qualify or not and also i have more questions for those who say that they completed okay apart from her and sister sarah and brother who else west you which chapter were you on huh who's raising the hand oh sister peace it's a beast which sister peace is this one ranum oh but what did she know what we're talking about at that time was she in the meeting mr peace you need to type also and let me know which chapter you are on when i ask people to finish uh i see that john says she was in chapter six so chapter six we are now on chapter four right so if it is chapter six that must have been the 31 church age so she reads saturn sadis philadelphia rhodesia and the regime of ages so how long did that take you sister john can you please send him into the chat and say how long it took you to read those four chapters and then also just a piece let us know okay who else brother brother solomon how long did it take you from which chapter uh chapter five okay so you were in the fragrance strategy do you understand what you were reading so what did you read in the other four pages in the 4a yeah no the one after what did you read that you you can tell these people that they should really ah i see sister john you say it took you four days okay that's good uh so you took a day for each chapter that sounds pretty possible a day for each chapter so that's a standard a very good standard huh brother you don't know what you read you're checking again so which means you never understood but just straight through you made your notes that's very good who else okay so only two people brother solomon sister joanne and sister peace is that peace i think you will have to invite her on one of our physical meetings here so you can come for a price right just a piece you have to come for your prize and then the others are also going to get theirs hallelujah you you want me you want to see it when i'm giving to them okay that's fine i can then prepare each one of our meetings and they will receive it with two hands hallelujah then i i see sister pieces saying she was on chapter seven uh she was on chapter seven so that means how long did it take you to read the remaining chapters the remaining three chapters uh peace you need to answer those questions do not first know whether you qualify or not all right i think we are now set to continue as she took her one week okay she's a slow reader but uh three chapters took her one week how many days seven days hmm and you people you have not completed even in those days so the question is what is wrong i think among all of us here locus is the most busy even those of you are working in the office you don't work her okay the work you want you're working with more left you know smaller more tasking on the body but it doesn't take a long time like the one she does you know but how far be ready chapter five which chapter were you on them by the time i told people to read okay let's do this whoever is on chapter five and below you are not serious why our standard is this is about us now for those who are very very slow whoever is still in chapter four has not even started chapter five i don't know we need even to test them away who is that one please raise up your hand who is still on chapter four now you you're not going to lie because you're christian raise that up your hand who is chapter four okay who is in chapter five apart from sister daughters you won five chapter four you just listen while reading oh just simply listen and in the middle there is left off oh brother how can we just listen why are you not blessing asia okay then brother he doesn't who else chapter five who's on chapter six seven eight eight that's very recommended chapter nine who is finishing up who is finishing up okay so now the one who who has as this chapter 8 is going to get gifts including the other ones he is he may get with one hand but he wrote again hallelujah because it's serious yeah yes and i'm not make sure i do it very very well so that you people should know these things yeah amen we should really be we should take this exercise very very serious this you never roast your hand from chapter four until all through are you in chapter three which chapter you own is the first time you finished it the second time you finished it you missed it you see how you remain now don't miss the rapture you can miss the game but don't miss the rapture you should be around when the rapture comes then what about uh now you're on the third chapter whatever i think this is recommendable people isn't it commendable would you really comment those things which are commendable isn't it brother have you read it which time how many times have you read it you have only read through ants you don't know how many times i just simply read it so which times have you read so far how many times so far once brother please someone help me write these names write this name someone please quickly get a paper brother you're the right person right write yourself your number one this is asara number two uh since i already gave okay what about brother what can we give okay okay fine fine brother you can write yourself sister did you receive your gift we have your hand if you received your gift did you tell me tell us was it with the two hands or one hand said 201 did you catch it with the jeweler yes she said two hands hallelujah amen you see this is what i'm talking about yeah that was good why are you speaking the secrets it is today then you you write yourself write yourself then you write about the solomon and then you write sister peace here and then you're right who else sister john ma john yes then marvin and this young man was ready three times which are you on chapter five you are just being true to yourself you are going your speed you are reading other things as well so you decided not to go in this race for us we were racing brother they're getting my brother can you please explain someone is one of them really understanding please can you explain what you read someone one person tell us what you read that this if i've not yet read that you think they might not know so you can advertise them also to read someone who is sharp or else i shall remove your name now because it seems as if you are you are just making us illegally before we give you a gift you shall even have to ask me some questions as well no no one will have to check these things okay so who but i'm having what is it that you have read that they don't know are you speaking out of good faith [Laughter] hey [Music] [Laughter] yeah you see it is good it is a sacrifice yeah but i might call it a sacrifice have you ever seen you know i watched one day i watched a video there was a small boy very very small listen to the story please and he was cutting he was carrying firewood big you know he was carrying some firewood from a timber team it was timber it was firewood from one place to the house and i'm not doing this so as he was carrying as he was carrying you know he would fall down and then it would appear sure he cannot pass here he's a small boy the thing is big but he will get up again and carry and fall down again and carry and forward and again and carry until he reaches the house after falling and crying and falling and crying sometimes he would fall and even the legs would go up he would come back again and carry while crying i call that great preach but did the boy take the dream by all the wood in the house did they deliver it did he not suffer that is called sacrifice it's called greed it's called not giving god brother don't discourage these people saying that they're not understanding someone has told me that three times the first time he was just reading through the second time he was trying to understand and let's do it like that like you remember we used to do a summaries simply because you can't do something it doesn't mean that someone else cannot and you too can do it if you really want to all who say that well i can't you you're really kind how many hours you sleep some of you being as mature as you are still sleep for 10 hours even more than 10 hours the longest i sleep myself is six hours these days because there's so much to do but you guys will sleep maybe 10 hours in the night and again you add you drop up two to three hours during the daytime because i'm i mean lock down not reading books and then you are saying i didn't have enough time please read read so you can be able to get something for your heart for your soul amen all right we have now taken one hour already of our time and i know it is not in vain that was also very important now here is what we are going to do because of the interest of time since that joanne has typed here what she was reading that people don't know nothing about about the twelve tribes of the sons of jackal do you know about it brother so you know them [Music] uh and what does it mean my brother we are speaking mysteries is it comes in seven different different periods but it's one spirit so the seven spirits are the him but now in different now some of you are wondering what is he talking about because he has ahead of you huh yes you just pray her that we get even there by the time you look down this down before you go back to studying your moral shoes and stuff like that uh so by the shave now you can agree that he has the manners ahead of me can you give him credit but you can your friends was the best known messenger of all ages we don't know whether she read that but we'll get to that all right now um i'd like us to today the way i'm going to do it i'm going to let brother brother our brothers and brother read for us as we are listening when you have something you want to ask about you you stop him or you you you raise up your hand and then we shall be able to uh pause and explain a bit if there's something i'd like to explain we'll as well do that can you put the screen so that people can follow or you can as well fall in your book for the new book why did we stop right here animal life and it could not come back upon the sinner making him clean revelation 2 10 fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you into prison that you may be tried and you shall have tribulation ten days be thou faithful unto death and i will give thee a crown of life every time the lord uses those words fear not there is an engagement at hand which will involve great danger and suffering and deprivation now he does not say in a blonde curt manner tribulation is coming that would frighten one but like a mother who was about to turn out the light says gently to her child lest he be frightened now don't be afraid for the light will go out and it will be dark but remember that i am here with you so he says don't be afraid of man or what he can do to you i am with you and my grace is sufficient for you when you pass through the waters they will not overflow you not even in death are you defeated you are more than conquerors the greater part did you hear that not even what we sing a song lord even in death he is [Music] [Music] oh even death could not conquer him even in the grave he's the law [Music] [Applause] even in [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you see you say even death could not defeat you you are more than conquerors that doesn't mean that death won't come it doesn't also mean problems won't come you are christian you must always know that you are more than a conqueror why because jesus conquered everything you go through you're going to suffer many many things as a christian this manner teaches us in this chapter we learn many many things about suffering that suffering because of who you are will be a necessity for you to attain correct healing and so it will come let us proceed would we have a problem with that what is happening okay well you have books follow following your books as brothers are trying to put it up so paul knew from experience the reality of those words and he wrote in romans 8 35-59 who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter may in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for i am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord no we are not to fear his love casts out all fear now notice what he says the devil will cast some of you into prison that you may be tried the jews were doing that right then the pagan priests were doing that right then the governors who tried to curry favor with the public because the people liked the arena hurled the christians by the thousands to their death destroying them by lions and gladiators what has the devil to do with this why blame him ah yes but it is the devil's hatred behind it all he is behind it all for he hates god what god has set his heart on satan is bound to try to destroy but watch here is some illumination if satan is behind the jews who are hailing the christians into court then the jews are not of god's religion but the devils their gathering is also of the synagogue of satan and if the roman catholic church killed the multitudes of believers in the dark ages yes and in all ages then they are of the devil and belong to satan also and if you think this is shocking now before we continue that part i would have you look at somebody up there where he says are you following please yes uh where he says that uh the devil is behind it all and at this time there was a time when christians for 10 years as we shall see down there they were persecuted they would be imagined women with children they would be thrown in in a an arena with women with uh who were pregnant they would be throwing an arena where lions would be ready to eat them up and they eat them they were using them just to spot on them to play again it was a game to make people happy and to you know relax their nerves the romans and so they did that and these romans were calling themselves jews by calling themselves jews they were trying to claim their originality to say they were the ones because you see christianity it's like it appears it came from the jews from the jewish culture so they said we are the jews we are we're the right jews in other words we are there by this time our denomination had not formed yet but it was imminent it was about to form it would form in the in the following age so we can now see that uh they were behind it and that it wasn't them those romans it was really the devil was behind he has believers let me tell you the devil hates you if you are a true believer he hates you he helps you and he will do all he can to bring you down he never plans for every true believer every day you don't know how many meetings sit in hell simply because of you so then if the devil is planning for you that way how much more do you think god is planning for you hallelujah but remember that these people were persecuted but god said i know he never he never let those things not happen but that didn't mean that god was not a miracle working god but at this time this was the anointing he was moving here which i began to say this at this time it was uh the ox anointing you know whereby it's a a beast of sacrifice a beast of burden they had a lot of body on their heart you know such persecution and suffering and you know they were being sacrificed like that and then they would be annoyed they would kill this woman because she has refused to be counter religion or whatever and they would bring another one also and the the other one would also be given a chance to recount but he would refuse but today the only choices you need to make is between christ and the world and if you are it's so hard oh i need my trousers if you're a god oh i need my lipstick oh i need these things okay go and take them and go to hell but if you love jesus you do not play with jesus and still go to that vomit you see you don't wallow in your vomit you leave it then come back to christ he will he he can't have you can't take him because if how would you stand on the day on that day in the rapture with such people who get their lives for these calls which same cause we are standing for also how can you stand with them when you in your generation you are not able to overcome those things which are before wait until the prophecy of revelation 13 is fulfilled it is strikingly true that the united states of america is in that chapter the very number 13 is a symbol of this nation it started with thirteen colonies its flag has thirteen stars and thirteen stripes and there is her destiny in the thirteenth chapter in this image that is mentioned in this chapter will be found all the wickedness of the beast that was before it as the beast rose at the nicene council so the image will come out of the world council of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the true vine of god it will be a repeat performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty those who fight the humble of god and scoff and destroy let them do it and do it they will and all in the name of god and religion but they lie they are not of god they are of the this is this part i want i want to go back up here it says as the beast rose at the nicene council so the image will come out of the world council of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to vent the anger of the devil upon the true vine of god do you hear that what will happen the image will do what it will come out that image okay i'm looking for the the path that part see right here as the viscerals are the missing cancer so the image will come out of the wild cancer of churches with all ungodly and satanic power to reinvent the anger of the devil upon the true vine of god do you know that this thing is information now did you know that actually it has already the image is already now clear that it is going to be made out of the america out of the u.s out of the why the kinds of churches is head what are there this is the image which will exercise the same power the same demonic satanic power like unto the first beast remember that the other beast was wrong it was that the the power which was persecuting the believers even this generation but now in any time it's going to be the world because they're religious they will also call themselves religious but this one will also be a religious movement claiming to wipe out those ones who are bad but actually they will be the one wiping out the true vine of god but of course they'll persecute but we know that persecution through persecution by the time it materializes that much the bride of christ will be out of here during the time when the the beast system will take over the world well i hope and believe that you would be ready to get out of here you know we sang something that they're ready to leave in a twinkling of an it will be a repeat performance of all diabolical cunning and cruelty those who fight the humble of god and scoff and destroy let them do it and do what they will and all in you hear that you are humble you are the humble of god a child of god right yes no big large rich you just humble someone who will laugh at you will scoff at you or you are a fool oh look at you the things you're doing the way you're addressing ah sister peace if you decide to do those things they will laugh at you don't scorn until they and he says sure they will they will don't ever think oh no me i'm praying that they want at least for me they win they must if they don't then you are one of them they should and they will right yes but they lie they are not of god they are of their father the devil they by their deeds against any people expose themselves for what they are let them organize and repudiate the little flock they but further reveal to all that they are of the devil they are the false vine the vine that murders their hatred proves who they are the nicolaitan antichrist church is who they are they shall be cast into prison yes they are hailed into court and falsely accused and tried and imprisoned and of course it is all done in the name of religion and decency and outraged innocency all done for a good cause that makes me think of the supreme court's ruling on prayer and bible reading in the schools who is behind it satan is it is just another angry outburst against god thou shalt have tribulation ten days i hope you know that uh there was a ruling i don't know i did not know that it happened even much earlier than in the days of rajabana but it was even recently that there wouldn't be bibles to be read in the churches in the u.s now you know when president trump came he tried to you know change that but even here in uganda and all countries this thing is coming yes they will not allow bibles to be read in schools they will not allow prayers to be made in schools they will also introduce new curriculums which are they've also they're one of the tribes even to do it already in other countries where they teach that in uh they teach types of families you know all of you the directive types of families in school there is how many types of families two types of families the first family the nuclear family and then there what's the nuclear family father mother biological children but they knew the extended family is the uncle's grandfather man they are all living together now that's all of us know this because we have been taught in school not in church did you know that yes now this new age this this devil is going to inspire these world leaders to introduce new curriculums that are adding another type of fun right and other types of family not even type where you have father father and children mother mother and children then the children will ask you see today we have two types of sex we have male and female in the new curriculum there will be more more not even two only or three only or four only there will be types of of sexes you know that'll be male female transgender gay lesbian and you know it is etc some of you don't even know what those things mean but this is what they're going to teach our children and children will ask teacher what does transgender mean and the teacher will have to explain that to explain directly things that are anti-word things that are antichrist they'll have to brainwash the children is mine so that actually the bride will not have to be here that bride will be squeezed out and this is where we are headed this has already started to work in some countries don't think it is like uh you know something that is not going to happen it's a new age it's a it's a devil's agenda the devil has an agenda but also god has an agenda if you do not submit to the agenda of god you will suddenly submit to the agenda of the devil and my my prayer for you each of you is that please submit to the agenda of god let him give you his word so that you can now transfer it to your children and their children will they should if the road turrets but if you yourself are not serious with god now ask yourself what generation is coming after you huh that's why you find even churches be that as big old churches in this message it can be on fire that when you know the other generation dies out this other generation is very lazy the others used to go the street and preach these ones even tell me to pretend the street huh takes off you know the other generation used to pray for the sick this one doesn't even know what prayer it means the other you know she used to speak in tongues these ones even they thought that tongues are no longer for believers the other generation used to you know be on fire sing and jump this generation you have to tell them hey come on clap your hands now tell me what generation is coming after this generation if a generation is this way is this what you want to pass on to another generation then how would your children be if you yourself are like this how will it be my desire is oh god let not only my generation but also the generation that you i will leave behind let it be a generation for you but if you don't don't even like yourself that your generation can be like this and then the other one will be good on fire from god forget about it it has to be passed down you see so you it has to begin with you the move begins with you the power of god begins with you the realities of the word begins with you because this god we are serving is not a god of history or god of stories is a god that is present every time when people seek him you will see these people how they suffer and say that that shall have tribulation 10 days here is a prophecy and with it is a means of determining the lifespan of the smyrnian age diocletian the cruelest of all emperors launched a terror campaign against the saints of god but except for the mercy of god would have wiped out all believers it was the bloodiest in history and lasted ten years the 10 days of revelation 2 10 be from 302 to 312 be thou faithful unto death he does not say be faithful until no one stopped me there but then i want to ask do you understand that yes brother billy paul what are the 10 days that the bible is speaking of in this uh thou shalt have tribulation 10 days it's going to come it's going to come when whatever tribulation okay so what was that brother be reported rather where people are fed to animals yes all right so this was the time when the christians were really persecuted for a special period especially ten years from three to three or two to three one two and uh this was uh the the time of this uh emperor called darcian who was a roman emperor and he persecuted the christians of course christians have been persecuted for very many years and it's not a new it's not like it's a new thing you know it's true if they're if the christians were persecuted then they're passing they are also they should be oh there must be persecution today also and that there will be persecution also so it's not like uh it happened then it will not happen now and do not happen in the future it happened then it's it's gonna happen in the future and it should happen now if god moved then and he's going to move in the future should he move now so you see it it has to be the same way so that's why we cannot put god in the past and put him in the future and do not put him in our today if god moved now and he will move if we move go with god move in the past and he will move in the future he must move now or the one who moved in the past was not good and if the devil moved then and he's gonna move in the future is moving now then god must move yes people are saying that you know they're chasing out demons they're casting out demons but they don't believe in the power of godly unless you are saying the devil does not is not in existence today then i cannot agree to what you are saying that uh god is not here today miracles don't exist today do you believe in miracles yes how many believe in miracles here amen just shout amen yeah we believe in miracles and if miracles still exist then that means god is still here because it is god who does miracles it's good who moves it's good who speaks it's god who sets free all right let us proceed but unto death you may have to seal your testimony with your blood thousands yay millions have died during all the ages they died in the faith like antipas the faithful martyr they held not their lives dear unto death often we think that it would be almost impossible to be a martyr but dare to recall that the faith we daily use to triumph in christ jesus is the same faith that upholds the polycarps and all martyrs the supreme faith will give supreme grace for the supreme hour blessed be god forever and i will give the supreme faith will give supreme christ bring grace for hallelujah isn't that wonderful hey man of life since not even a cup of cold water given in the name of the lord fails to receive a reward how great shall be the reward to him who gives his life as a martyr for the name of the lord jesus perhaps we can get a small idea if we compare this crown with the crown one in a race in first corinthians 9 24 paul says know ye not that they which run in a race run all but one receiveth the prize so run that ye may obtain a crown given to the winner of the olympic race was a garland of olive branches but the crown spoken of here in the revelation given to a martyr is the crown of royalty jesus calls it the crown of life the one crown is for those who have striven the other is for those who have given both crowns are incorruptable they will not perish the winners of the worldly race of life will soon lose the joy of the plaudits of the world their glory will fail but those who give their lives for god either by daily striving or shedding their blood as the crowning sacrifice of their lives will be given the crown of life all too little time is spent on laboring for the eternal rewards of god the recompense of god is too lightly esteemed if we believe in the reality of the resurrection of the body and an eternal kingdom of substance then we ought to lay up in heaven those good treasures that are available to the faithful saints the reward for overcoming revelation 2 11 he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth unto the churches he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death now once again the spirit is talking to all the ages this message is to comfort us today even as it has comforted our brethren of all the other ages and he says to us that the second death will not hurt us we all know that the second death is the lake of fire revelation 20 14 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death what's the second date okay so what's the first the first one huh according to you what is the first day please people when we are hearing okay ask questions this is something that you raise up your hand we will talk about it don't just we are not coming here to be entertained huh be active ask questions yes brother huh see where did you see that is saying that when we die from here that is the first day exactly hallelujah the first date is when we die from here yeah the death the death of the flesh and then the second death is the real serious issue you know whoever goes into the first death will resurrect boom did you hear that yes whoever goes into the first death will resurrect both good and bad did you ever think of that the resurrection morning when the death is that that trump of god shuts down we shall rise i don't know yahweh shall rise wisher is everybody going to rise in that resurrection in the resurrection morning when death prison bars are broken we shall rise hallelujah we shall rise we shall rise we shall rise amen we shall rise hallelujah oh it's wonderful so everybody's good for rice everyone is going to rise hallelujah is everything going to rise in that resurrection you get it you need to understand is everyone going to rise i want your answers now his brother is ever going to rise in that resurrection morning who says yes who says no yes okay what's the resurrection morning but then when is it happening okay those ones who are saying yes okay this yes when the lord comes hallelujah that's very very good yes when the lord comes that's when the resurrection of the morning is happening when the trumpet of the law shall sound and death in christ shall rise you see yes that's what the trumpet of the lord shall sound and the law shall come down in the air and then the dead end shall rise we will shall be changed and together we will meet those ones who are in the air but please not everyone who was that who was dead will rise on that resurrection morning that resurrection morning is not forever living person who died it is only for the bride of christ for all the ages when all the redeemed of all ages which one is that the redeemed of all ages shall rise you see they rise on that resurrection morning it's that's what i call the election morning is the rupture it's only for the bride of all ages amen we are not talking about the bride of samana the bride of samana will be there the private ephesians will be there the bride of pegamos will be there the brother will [Applause] including us we will be there if we are still alive we shall be changed and then we go now the rest shall remain dead then they shall remain dead even more will die after our rapture did you know that yes so they will remain until when can someone answer that question right quick god bless you brother but when the lord comes down with his bride he's not coming right away to judge you see before he judges he has to first enjoy with his bride hallelujah just have some wonderful time with his bride you know when you get ma when you marry what if you don't want to go out there and beginning say who was there giving me the trouble hey show me i'll show them no before you go into those issues you have to first go and relax your love somewhere you understand hallelujah it's going to be he's going to first be the bride amen will go uh with his bridegroom because remember they will have their marriage in heaven then from there they will come on down in the earth and they will already have a palace down here you know a city you know which will be built by god himself to come down from him and in that place that's where the bride will be with the bread room for some time what how long will that time what what's what does the iranian mean millennium means what brother two thousand years four one thousand years hallelujah they will be there for one day rejoicing hallelujah one day is equal to one thousand look at me if you don't understand three and a half years that is that's now the time for eating is the time for the marriage supper of the lamb in heaven you will know when you get there just get there you know yes after they come down for 1000 years three and a half years remember the three and a half years not days yes it is just three and a half years real real like generally okay that's that's a good question if you have been following the series that i was teaching you shouldn't have asked that because for every wednesday we are teaching on the dispensation of the gentiles and before i touched on this perception of the gentiles i did speak a little bit about uh let me first stop this for a minute here you know i i i i touched on the uh under what 70 weeks of daniel and i told you that the 70 weeks of daniel was weeks of years and and and that time that time line or the time span of the 70 weeks of the jews started at a time when the instruction was given to rebuke jerusalem and it goes all through until the millennium you understand so it's the time of god working with the jews not the gentiles but the what the jews but that time was cut off when the messiah was cut off and that time when it was cut off it was cut off in the last seven years because remember there was one week which when the messiah came that week started and the messiah ministered for a three the messiah christ ministered for a special three years and a half and that special three years and a half was then he was cut off and from that time the jews were cut off because remember the time was paused the moment the messiah was cut off but he was no longer working with them according to romans chapter 11 this is what we are discussing every wednesday we have been discussing that every wednesday so you have to go back to those videos if you didn't understand you watch it again you will get it very well so so then the messiah was cut off now their time was paused you're going to put a pose on it so that you can do what do something do what what is that something that you used to do both of those answers are correct but the one i love more is the other one he was looking for a bride hallelujah he his intention was to have a wife even you brother when you grow up a little bit your intention will not be money just like joseph he was sold among the egyptians but when he reached there he said i have to find a bride for myself even christ he was thrown among the gentiles he said okay fine i will use this to find a bride for myself and he became lord over us as a god said lord we call him lord jesus because he has become a prince among us he has become a beloved among us and so he is now seeking for a bride for a space of how long we do not know how many years but what we know is that it's going to be a space of seven gentile dispensations and those seven gender dispensations is actually seven edges which we call the seven church edges seven churches which god is in each church calling out a bride calling out a bride and then after this first of these seven church edges what will happen uh i think i'll have to get you a picture here for you to see what i'm explaining uh after the specifics after the space of the seven church ages then it is going to go back again to the jews all right then that would be the last remaining remember it was seven years it was cut into two how much was remaining come on somebody have you been following me yeah three and a half years okay so the three and a half years which was remaining is going to be completed this is remember which was the time of the jews it's going to be completed at a time when the messiah goes back to the jews where would you be at that time because you will be in heaven on the marriage sucker then now from there on down when we come back we are going to come back at the end of the three years and a half not only that but also at the end of the third world war because remember the third world war the one to put a stop on it would be the messiah himself christ himself he will come down with ten thousands of his saints you come riding on a cloud hallelujah behold he comes riding on the clouds shining like the sun had a trumpet call so lift your voice it's the ear of jubilee out of zion's his salvation calm there's nobody like jehovah there's no god like jehovah there's nobody come on now there's [Music] oh [Music] salvation [Music] see that is happening when we are coming down with him we are going to come with him and we are coming to take over this world hey that is when that scripture will be fulfilled which says the kingdoms of the world have become the kingdom remember the stone which was held down from a big rock without a hand and it hit that image that uh the because i saw that stone it means the kingdom of god it will come and hit the kingdoms of the world and finish it completely because remember by the time it comes it will be during the war of armageddon and them and then there will be there will be targeting to an electorate wipe out israel at that time but you remember when he comes down he the bible says that they all saw him and when they saw him they brought all their nuclear whatever warheads and everything to shoot him down because like what is this so they turned it towards the event but the bible says that then you know he he he he consumed them with a sword out of his mouth hallelujah so he's not going to you know you know have artilleries like a nuclear warhead what he will have from his mouth will be stronger than that he'll only speak a word and they will all just be nothing you know hallelujah it will be smothering greens and debris and that will bring into this world a new era a new phase whereby the kingdoms of the world meaning america russia come on all those kingdoms you know it will no longer hold because remember for a space of three years and a half there was a world here there was things happening here you know russia was still there america was still here and all this was still here but they think they are super powers and of course they connect with raw excuse me wrong and vatican but you see by the time the lord jesus comes down we sing that song the lord is coming back to earth again the lord is coming back to us again a thousand years will have no temper then after jesus shall come back to us again one more time oh the lord is jesus shall come back to us again suddenly he will be bound with chains of circumstance what circumstance he will have no one to take that's why he will be bound for a space of a thousand years and of course we notice and understand that it is at the same time when he comes down he will finish the other phase and start another phase the first he will start he will be the king he will be the superpower and that someone tell me and then the bride will be in there with him to rule with him to rule what in his kingdom through the whole world don't think that the whole world will be just soil and things you know there it is ruined you know everything gets ringed but there will be a few men that will be left the bible says it and those remnants will multiply like the sons of the sea of course we don't know how they survive but i presume some of them would you know in the north pole and in the south pole they will survive they will hide themselves and from the wrath of god and others you know these days they have bankers they call them nuclear bankers they hide the die you know those big guests and those big kind of those leaders you know they would hide there and they would come out afterwards you know they even acted movies out of that was this is their movie called credit or something like that and so they they come out after the world is new you know you know these people who played who wrote the scripts probably they read the bible so they will come out everything is new they don't know what is in the world now they have to hunt for life and they will not find that but actually the truth of the matter is when they come out they will reunite work with whoever has been left and they will multiply quickly they will reproduce quickly and they will fill the world out again but guess what there won't be devil attempt them because you'll be bound at that time but guess what there will be another kingdom ruling on this world at that time and who will be the king he'll be the king of kings king jesus will have taken over he'll be ruling with who within me oh oh my god when you say when you say that where the kingdom of uh of uk the the kingdom of the of great britain you know the the the the way it acts the way it does things you know some of these things take only what is going to happen when you see them you know they call this on the duke of a somewhere the duke of whatever the duke or whatever that's how we shall be you know maybe you you will be the duke of america duke of africa you better you understand remember it's going to be the bride out of seven churches hallelujah so i'm sure that every bride of one generation will probably be given to be the duke of of one of the continents amen we will rule this one amen and all bowing down to us so don't bow down to the world now if you bow down to the world now you would that you you they will you you will not be in that time but if you if you you you bow to jesus christ now and he is why during that time they will bow down to you also your time is coming now it is their time but yours is coming wait hallelujah [Applause] because you will be appointed by the king of kings that's right with him listen to this he will be the director speaking speak when he has spoken and we will be there to rule with him imagine then after one thousand years now we can now comfortably judge everyone who was there the bible says everyone who has ever lived with rights that is the mass resurrection system the second now the the resurrection now the first one was for the bride now this is the second floor everyone else they will resurrect for judgment that's why the bride is not going to be in the judgment because for us we don't resurrect a long long time ago we have been here for a long time so we just mean we won't be in the before the white throne judgment but we will be on it why because we will be judging together with him imagine don't lose this don't miss this don't miss this for cheap cheap things here for cheap things of the world imagine how can you miss this how can you miss because of anything compare can you compare these things over the world right now with what you will get then what does the scripture say let me pick that scripture for you we cannot compare these things at all what we shall get if we are patient if we overcome we cannot compare the bible says in the book of roman book of romans chapter eight oh friends oh verse 15 romans 8 15 hallelujah oh hallelujah amen oh my don't worry when if you you're so touched by this and you shout or you act funny and someone can't understand just go right on hallelujah amen whether they call you a fanatical or a foolish person it's all right hallelujah i tell you this is marvelous but as many as a ladder i'll begin for verse 14 for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear amen my good lord someone help me here my mama so you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of abduction whereby we cry abba father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of god no man can take it out of me it is already inside me i know i'm a child of god there are some who can tell me that i'm not who can tell me the devil whatever how can he convince me that i'm not a child of god how can he convince me that i'll not rule with christ how can he he can't rather because i already know who i am i didn't say and if children oh i love this listen to this and if children then hairs that's right amen hairs of god amen and then he says joy anybody to be a hair of god i'm here to a mansion [Music] [Applause] right now i may live in a tent or a cottage why should i care listen to this now there are buildings oh my goodness for me i don't know about you but for me over there you might as well say it for me although right now i may be exiled from home but yet something in me tells me but still i will sing o glory to god you see and if children then hairs of us romans 8 17 did you not get it and if children then heads hairs of god and he said now this is the most amazing part joint hairs with christ oh amen because if christ the son of god and i'm a son of god then we'll join jesus christ if so be that we suffer with him you know we are reading smile samantha was a time of suffering for the believers if so be that we suffer with him will christ accept to suffer with christ if you can't suffer with him you cannot rule with him you cannot be a judge here with him you must be ready to partake of christ his suffering someone shout amen for god and then he says that we may be also glorified together he was glorified that we also may be glorified i am not reading from a textbook i am reading from a bible the word of god hallelujah he doesn't lie and then and then he says i recall that the sufferings of this present time this is what i wanted i'm not worthy to be compared with the glory we shall be revealed in us hey did someone hear that the sufferings whatever you're suffering right now of this present time i'm not worthy to be compared with the glory which has been revealed in us oh my brother and sister the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared how can you compare you come and someone says yes your majesty yes your majesty simply because you have appeared remember you'll be closed in glory hallelujah you'll be closing glory you will not have this old rotting stinking body you will have another body [Applause] hallelujah whereby when these people see these commoners business actually people when they see us they just say your majesty hallelujah your majesty the queen [Applause] [Applause] we shall be very many so they will give us portions maybe in africa each of you will have a portion of a very large one of course not just a small uganda very large one and then you will be the one who are the minister of that area hallelujah why because it will be something new for them they can't understand this they can't function they can't comprehend it it'll be too big for them to understand so the only thing just like you when you challenge you are like oh but for you you're bigger than an angel that will be much greater than the one angels will have that's why we sing and say we will sing a song but the angels cannot sing [Music] nothing about redemption hallelujah but you know all about redemption yes you've been redeemed hallelujah oh my god think about that think about that think about that amen i don't even want to know all i know is when i'm there everything to worship me will be there hallelujah this the jews they want them for the fourth of they will also be in there in the millennium to serve us queen should be sad just to be there and you do everything for yourself they do everything for you some of you that don't want to shower even then someone else will do it for you [Laughter] oh glory to god i don't i don't even think you're not made of showers because you will have a new body hallelujah a body which is greater than an angelic body for the honest expectation of the creature waited for the manifestation of the sons of god one of these days we are going to be manifested if you think this is a story wait and see hallelujah if you think it's just a story wait and see tell your neighbor what you can see if you think it's just a story wait and see this is not just a story amen this is reality it's going to happen one of these days [Applause] don't let this much much most things take you away from his grace don't let these small small things but okay but uh isaac huh this is much more things of the wow that's strange you got what i'm saying yes sister peace please please wait a minute i played with you now because then i can't play with you don't let these small small things of the world just take your heart away throw them kick them cast them with them and you with your rights to this the glory is there not here yes this is hell my mom said when he went into the other room because god took him there and also he took care but abandoned was able to speak like someone who has been in hell and someone was bringing heaven at the same time he came back and he said when i was there i looked on down i saw all those muggles his body was in my words and everything was mad but said lord let me go please let me go back your time is not yet your time is not yet you still have to complete your job he was like oh he's gonna come back to my goods this is my goods this is my goods now imagine how much do you love your body do you love it more than god it's maggots imagine people are there they already have maggots and they are putting again lipstick on muggles as if to make it nice but i'm saying when you see a woman wearing lipstick call him mrs dog's meat it might sound hard but that's the truth that's the truth because jesse bell god fed her to the dogs so because she was painting herself this is my god don't let these things take your heart young people don't let it don't let it there are many things that seem as if they are enticing as if they are pulling but don't give it a chance you have the the power doesn't dwell with anybody else it dwells with you in you you see there is a glory which we are going to have an experience there brother sir glory is there it's coming let's work for it that's what we're seeing we will work to jesus till jesus comes till jesus comes and we will be gathered we'll walk we will walk we will walk till jesus comes [Applause] [Music] oh may you walk until he comes don't give up don't give it don't surrender don't be great don't bow down to the door hallelujah oh my wish you can make that result myself i made it i made it i made it about 16 years ago now i married man and ever since i've never never turned down i've never let down the mass by grace of god you two can do it there is nothing can hinder you there is no enemy that can defeat you there is no nothing can make you not do it if you so desire to have it then they don't know what is taking place they may not be committing right now in nam gong but you are the greatest group that there is because you know what it's going to be like the rest of the people they're just fantasizing maybe this will happen maybe they don't know maybe oh i didn't even know where i came from so where would i go they don't know nothing but you know if they want answers you are the answer hallelujah i mean you can't do this you can't do this anymore i can't why what's wrong with you because i found something i found something that it's much more valuable than these things of the world i know you're a fool well if i'm a fool i better be a fool then than to perish i better be a fool and and receive that glory then than to be wise now and be a fool then think about those things shall we proceed of course that means all those who were therein were cast into the lake of fire now then i want to bring out something here for you it no doubt will cause people to comment on my strange doctrine but i stand here on the authority of the word of god and deny that the unbeliever goes to an eternal hell and burns their eternally in the first place hell or the lake of fire or whatever you want to call it is not eternal how can it be if it had a beginning in matthew 25 41 it says that everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels now if it was prepared then it wasn't without a beginning if it had a beginning then it can't be eternal of course you might stumble over the idea of the word everlasting but that word means from the ages to the ages and has different meanings attached to it in first samuel 3 13-14 god told samuel that he was going to judge the house of eli forever and that they would offer no more sacrifices forever as his priests and in second kings 2 27 solomon thrust out the last descendants of eli from the priesthood that was four generations or so later now you can see that everlasting does not compare with what is eternal or that which had no beginning or end here in this case the word everlasting means to the vanishing point that is what happened they vanished look at the word destruction over in second thessalonians 1 9. who shall be punished with everlasting destruction in the greek destruction positively means annihilation and the word destruction does not mean destroying now destroying means something going on and on in decay so what can everlasting annihilation mean it doesn't mean to keep on annihilating or that would make the word destroying instead of destruction it means to destroy to the ending point end it you might wonder now when you can use that word eternal and not use it the way we have been taught that is easy when it applies to god it means to be without beginning or end and ever enduring and never ceasing and when you talk of eternal life you have that in mind which is the life of god this is the record that god has given us eternal life and that life is in the sun he that hath the son hath life now then only sons of god have life eternal the kind that never had a beginning but always was that is right you have something in you right now that is eternal without beginning or end it is the spirit of god it is a part of god himself it is the life of god now if a sinner is going to go to hell and then suffer the same as you are going to heaven and enjoy heaven then he has the same kind of life you have already well then there might be those who say eternal life signifies the welfare of the children of god it is their welfare and enjoyment that is at stake on the other hand the sinner goes to his punishment so that we can reduce the second death to a matter of punishment and place eternal life means heaven and eternal punishment means hell you would be surprised at the men who have been exalted as theologians that believed that but do you know what that does it makes eternal life a matter of geography instead of a person eternal life is god the lord jesus christ how anyone could believe such a thing that eternal life is a matter of place is more than i know okay some another question um yes and then right now when we stop she was explaining the point saying that when we talk about eternal life it's not a place it's not a geographical place that you are thrown in in some place and you're going to be there for eternity eternal destruction means it's going to do our with you and highlight you how long does it take for you to be in that geographical fire that place where you're going to be for how long frontiers wants to do over with you but but eternal life in itself is not a place eternal life is a person it is god himself there's only one source of eternal life and that is zoey god is own life there are fire that's why we cannot say that hell is eternal because if you say that hell is eternal it means in the people's understanding when you say that hell is eternal to them they kind of feel that uh you actually mean that uh the people are going to be there like you are going to be in heaven you're going to be in hell for eternity and i'm going to be in heaven for eternity if that were to be true it means we all have the same kind of eternity do you understand eternity is life without end eternal means without end so if you're going to be in hell without end you already have eternal life you gotta pray how many get the point that's right if you say you're going to be in hell which will have no end it certainly means you have another life it is some sort of some kind of eternal life but again there is only one source of life that is god and how can i who is in christ had eternal life and then you who is in here having no life impossible so hell is a place where they will go and they will ban for years and years and years they will be punished there for years and years and years and years and decades and decades and millenniums until when he wants to grow with it okay in the new heaven and a new in the new art there's not going to be a hair that's one that that one's for you revelation 21. so there's no hair there because there's only going to be life and there's only one life that is joy god himself so those who are a part of him those who have a life like that of his will be there then praise the lord okay someone gets it makes me stagger to think of it no sir there is only one kind of eternal life god has it if we have god we have eternal life in and through him so you see that word eternal or everlasting can be applied in various ways but when it applies to god he being what he is it has one meaning it is the duration of god you can't apply it like that to any other thing god alone is eternal and because he lives we live with him now don't let anyone say that i don't believe in a lake of fire and in punishment i do i don't know how long it will last but it will eventually be removed in revelation 21 8 it says that those sinners mentioned will have their part in the lake of fire but the true interpretation of the word is not part but it is time see there you have it so the wicked shall be cast into hell hades or the grave and hell into the lake of fire separated from god what a terrible thing that will be but with the righteous it shall not be so they don't have to fear they have been redeemed by god they are in his bosom they are the overcomers and who is he that overcometh he that believeth that jesus is the christ why will this overcomer this believer escape and go into realms of eternal life and bliss because jesus paid a price to ransom us from sin he filled the gap of separation and we who were afar off are now made nigh by the blood and they will never come into condemnation they will never be in that lake of fire they can never be lost for he will lose none of them not one of the redeemed will be anywhere except where jesus is do you know why that is i'll illustrate it for you i have a little boy joseph he is a part of me no matter what happens if i were a rich man the worst i could do would be to disinherit him but there is nothing that i can ever do to deny him i can't because he is a part of me here let's take a blood test let's match his blood with mine it'll prove that joseph is my son he is mine it's the blood test that shows whether you belong to god or not i can't help thinking of the time that i used to ride heard on purebred herefords out in colorado we used to have to bring in those cattle for government inspection if we wanted them to feed on government range but they would not allow one single animal that did not have the blood tag on the ear the tag signified that it was purebred the rangers that looked them over did not once look at the brand they just looked at the tag to see that the blood was the right blood hallelujah if it's the right blood it's got to be right amen you know god looked down and declared the soul that sinneth it shall die it is separated from me it can't approach unto me we know that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of god that meant that all died all were separated and one day a time would come when even that bit of life would be snuffed out and it would be all over but god in love took an animal and took its life in the place of the sinner's life in the old testament the sinner brought a lamb he placed his hand on the lamb while the priest cut the lamb's throat he felt the bleeding and heard the bleeding he felt the body stiffen in death he saw the smoke of the sprinkled blood ascend to god he knew that the lamb had taken his place he knew that the lamb's life had been forfeited for his but the life of that lamb was animal life and it could not come back upon the sinner making him clean so he left with the same desire to sin he would go out with sin in his mind and come back and offer a sacrifice for the same thing a year later but in the new testament it is not so our dying lamb is the son of god who gave his blood a ransom for many by faith we walk up and place our hands upon that lamb we see him with the bloody wounds the lacerated back the cruel thorns tearing his brow we feel his pain and hear him cry my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and what happened the life that left that broken blood cell came back upon the repentant one the life that was in him came back upon us we go back with no more desire to sin and we now possess a hatred for the works and lusts of the flesh look at us what is our life just one little cell that came from our father the female does not have the hemoglobin she produces the egg she is the incubator but the blood comes from the male that is why the woman takes the man's name the children take his name the mother is the incubator for the children she bears him that is what happened for our redemption the holy ghost came upon mary and she bore a son and called him jesus the great creator came down and became a sacrifice for our sin his blood was the blood of god that is exactly what it was that blood of god was shed and the spirit left him as he died in agony then the same life spirit came back to indwell the repentant sinner and set him free that sinner did not come back year after year sacrifice after sacrifice for there was no need by one sacrifice once and for all he has been set free from the dominion of sin and has received the life of christ whereby he reigns in victory over sin the world the flesh and the devil god did it he did it all how many things that you are reading over one the world [Music] the scene what is the scene that you're running over the world the world the flesh the devil and unbelief are you following mr peace what things must you reign over see what is see and believe of the word of the world when you hear the word you have seen this in the bible you have seen it is the word of god but you refuse to do to do it you do something else that is it ah the second one that that the devil the third one the devil comes to you how i preached on that on sunday how does the devil come to you can someone help her how does the devil come to you in your mind he talks to you every day even now he may be talking every time he talks in your mind that's how the devil comes so you must overcome that as well number three you just saw with me the wire the the sin then the devil then the world are you hearing this the world that one has taken very many young people they you know do not it says do not be conformed to this world but be renewed be transformed by the renewing of your mind you see so the world will want you to do certain things in a in a way but you must renew your mind to do it in another way you see they want you to dress this way renew your mind to dress another way they want you to talk this way even language your language must change you if your mouth can't change some of those things you were speaking there in those drunkards in those unbelievers your friends out there that kind of language it should change also it is amazing the the charges of today the pastors are saying it is therefore meeting even outreach by doing what they are not doing so that they can reach them out he comes a man he's a he looks to be a mature man but actually he he wears you know he wears like a shirt which is almost harmless and then he has all kanyama so and then he wears a chain and then you know he wears that evenly some of them bumble even at church and then he comes yo yo man yeah you know to these younger people so that you can get them in the church and then they bring the worldly singers in the church yeah yeah yeah yeah man yeah go in they might represent here they have their language they think that by behaving like the world they will win the world you can never win the world by behaving like the world that's not what paul meant to the romans i am a roman that's not what he meant okay that's not exactly what he meant when you are going to win the world you have to overcome it fast in order to win the world to christ you know one person told me was it brother wrong he was innovating to me some of these people when they when they do crusades they bring a busy they rent singers from africa band from whatever you know does he you know changing those kind of by having a boy they bring them then they begin singing some kind of show but uh concert yeah you you've got it come there's a concert ah there's a concert there on the road yeah yeah you find the man they come hey man it's really nice so all those people will carve others the bread then afterwards they will pay him his money he will go and the pastor will come hallelujah yeah we have come to give you the word of life jesus says john 3 16 for god shall love the world and then now they have come rubbish how can i like be the forerunner of the world so they think that by at the meeting through the things the young people are doing that you will win them to you you will win them to christ no wonder when they come to quest they still don't get converted they remain in their miniskirts they're in their shorts the younger men they remain with their chains they remain with all those things they remain with that data language you know those kind of things you should not do that kind of thing you should let your mouth be washed by the blood of jesus christ hallelujah when you meet a brother if someone is doing it correct them don't also get caught up with that kind of language let your mouth be cleaned and washed amen not only your action on dressing and everything let everything about you decrease the bible says what i'm saying is the scripture it's the word it's not my thoughts he said considering the end of our conversation what do we talk what do we behave how do we behave how do we talk how do we behave you understand those things are possible said what i've been to you be to others who is your inspiration huh so why do we call ourselves brother so and so when when i meet you why do i say oh brother god bless you even if i am in any strange country may have traveled many countries but wherever i go i meet somebody they may know me because you i've been well on the internet blah blah blah publicized so someone may meet me say oh brother god bless you you know i was in zimbabwe i had never been there before and my first time killing life when i met somebody and this person said oh who are you because i did not know him but incidentally he had known me you know he had recognized me this is how it should be whereby we have codes that we can be able to know you know we also have a mark of christ that's the the mark of because whereby wherever you are you can be recognized by the way you dress the way you act you understand yeah they were asked there are men rasta men who worship the man rastafari in ethiopia they can recognize themselves they have said quote they have a chain they they smoke weed they do those things they yeah so when you when when when when you meet when you see those things and you meet him you recognize him yeah yeah my brother just been there because i know these things you know in a in a session it's called the money in ethiopia you know and they took me to their houses mind the house when you you know it's all deception of course you see it's like giving an option to christ and so it's all deception but you find them there they have their own code we as believers we also have our own code hallelujah one day i have been to nigeria my first time i did not know the the brother who i was going to see at the airport but i had a message book so i went with a message book with me here you know so you didn't see me he didn't know me but when he saw the message because he knew my name but he didn't know how i looked to me also hallelujah you say one day i was at the airport in a in a in um um what is this uh no no no ethiopia while at the ethiopian airport this brother comes to me and he had a book i do not know he's a believer but he's a congress i think he was a congressman maybe coming from china and then i said are you a believer god bless you immediately this is the code of believers world over hallelujah because we believe in the blessing of god and it makes rich and he adds no sorrow to it only so that is our code as believers therefore put that on so there are for brethren what i'm encouraging you let your mouth be washed let your life be washed let your behaviors be worse everything about you hallelujah and when someone is the opposite of what i'm preaching do not hate them but simply love them and teach them to do right by your actions not by simply talking sometimes even the bible says avoid unnecessary and stupid debates never debate the word when someone is debating they want to leave them alone don't debate the word never debate the word under no circumstance should you ever debate the word if someone is asking to know something tell them if they're debating leave them alone this is what brother banham said he was even refusing to go some also in collusion because he said i don't want to be better to those people and then brother who was which brother was it yeah i'm not going to debate these people they they want to hear you know you know i'm only going to take the scriptures and i will just give the people the scriptures i will not debate so when he confused by the parliament that he wasn't going to debate he was only going to give them the scriptures what the bible says and then leave him allowed him to go and then came covered you know and then he sat behind there until the period of fire came the holy spirit the prince of god came and told him go and led him to the pulpit and that's where when they took that picture i said purify was there but he did not go there to debate he went there to speak about his god period he wouldn't just be yeah you can even find them there the muslims are the seventh days [Applause] never go in those fruits don't waste your time with all these kind of things even when you think you're preaching to someone and they go into debating close the topic immediately because it will it will grip the spirit of god and the bible says grieve not there holy spirit of god which you were given until when the day of your redemption so we are not meant to debate with the people but we are simply meant to witness to them and show them love hallelujah show them what show them what how do you show up how do you show love somebody help me huh you have a point if someone can't see the word yet or is not yet revealed what is revealed to you even among each of you if i begin to take one point i'll ask each of you some things are revealed to you some are not each of us they have different levels of revelation now brother when something is revealed to you and it's not revealed to another you don't make them the devil because they simply didn't understand you but what you do as a child of god you bear with them love will bring forbearance love is kind love is wrong suffering love is you know what the voice is about challenge you don't read those things love never fails love covers the masterpiece love is corrective you can't see somebody and you love them doing something wrong and you'll be like god will correct them you don't love them because you review them you don't love them if you love them and they are doing something wrong meet them face them tell them what you're doing is wrong if they don't hear you you bring another brother don't just say if they don't hear you what the idiom period if they don't hear you you bring another brother to probably be a minister if they don't hear them they will bring you to the church to the church if they don't hear them they always communicate them out of you because it means they're not believers you understand this is how the scripture teaches us if you love somebody you correct them you tell them the love of god will draw you to draw them to christ we have a few moments let's just proceed again he cried out to the world cursed in sin i will give you a sign a virgin shall be with child a virgin shall conceive and bear a son that will be your sign it will be an everlasting sign what she brings forth will be emmanuel god with us god came down in a blood cell not through a man but by the holy ghost and in that virgin womb a tabernacle for the purpose of death was built the seed of the woman came in order that he be bruised to bring us our salvation when the holy ghost came upon mary he created within her womb the cell that would multiply and become the body of our lord that cell was created it was the beginning of the creation of god that is who jesus is and that holy one was filled with holy blood even the blood of god that tabernacle came to birth he grew to be a man he went to jordan and there that sacrifice was washed of john in the river called jordan when that acceptable sacrifice rose out of the water god came and indwelt him filling him with the spirit without measure and when he died and shed his blood the perfect life of god was liberated to come back upon the sinner who would accept the christ as his savior oh how striking it is jehovah born crying over a manure pile jehovah born in a manger of straw there is your everlasting sign to the proud and puffed up pseudo-intellectuals that have evolved their own theology and denied the truth of god jehovah god a crying baby in a stinking barn then we think we have a right to be proud holding up our noses criticizing and acting as though we were somebody here's your real sign this is the right one jehovah playing as a boy jehovah working in a carpenter's shop jehovah washing the feet of fishermen i'll give you a sign said god not the sign of a white-collared priesthood not the sign of wealth and power there's nothing in this sign that you will want or think suitable but it is an everlasting sign it is the greatest sign of all jehovah's standing in the courtyard bruised and bleeding with thorns on his brow and spit on his face mocked and set out not jehovah despised and rejected hanging naked upon the cross while the hypocrites jeered and dared him to come down off the cross jehovah dying jehovah praying and nothing happening then jehovah died that is the sign for all men now there isn't another like it it is the great one then darkness came upon the earth they put him in a tomb there he lay those three days and nights until an earthquake shattered the gloom of night and he came forth jehovah came forth jehovah ascended on high then jehovah returned to indwell his church jehovah came back with a mighty rushing wind and flames of fire jehovah came back to walk in the midst of his church and empower his people once more jehovah came and this time to stay in his people and again jehovah heals the sick raises the dead and manifests himself by the spirit jehovah came back speaking in tongues and giving the answer back in interpretation jehovah came down and he raised the prostitute to sin no more he came down to the drunkard with fly blows on his face as he lay unconscious in the gutter yes jehovah came to manifest in flesh and manifest through flesh jehovah came in us the hope of glory yes jesus came and shed his blood and set the captive free he came and redeemed his lost sheep he gave them eternal life and they shall never perish he won't lose one of them but raise them up at the last day hallelujah the second death cannot hurt them it has no power over them for they are the lambs and they follow him wherever he goes the holy spirit in every age revelation 2 11. okay there's a question here yes go ahead brother what is your question can you be a bit more vocal um okay um those are traditions those traditions were even here during the time of jesus but yet they would not believe him you remember they were doing those traditions even when jesus was here in flesh and they did believe him for who he was and they were continuing with their trade with the traditions so yes they do continue with the traditions but it holds nothing really because that tradition was only a shadow at a time of what of christ coming himself and when he came with the fulfillment of that type and shadow you know when when the holy spirit moves many people stay behind and they are like i am here because i'm doing what the world says do you notice the same word that told the people to put the blood on their door nose or whatever that's right and the same holy spirit that told them to move and go out but there are some who would say we're supposed to remain here this is where our protection is they even have proof brother when the death engine came we never died no none of us died here is our security we should remain here under the blood but there was more revelation move now under the cloud move now god is taking you to a higher level of revelation but basically if you would stay back still you would die so you see in the same same way we realized that these jews do not receive the revelation of the reality of their shadows and types and they they stay you know you always can receive the revelation that you have you have you can stay under that revolution you cannot go more than that if you believe you're poor for example you always believe you're poor you're not you're under that you know you cannot be more than what you believe you cannot be more than what is living new to you but when the messiah comes through the ministry of moses and elijah there are going to be jews 144 of then that will recognize the messiah to be the one that was the pastor of allah they will recognize him to be the lamb which was given in the in the temple they will recognize him to be the one that died to be the one who was the brazen serpent you remember that moses told them to put up they would recognize him to be all these things those 144 thousand jews and actually they would be the elect from among the jews so as regard the tradition yeah they continue with it but it doesn't hold any anyway they missed it they missed it many people even in our generation they continue worshiping the god they don't know because they missed it imagine they preach something that they missed like a thousand miles and they're enthused with that as if it were to be the truth you know if you you see them ah i'm going to baptize my baby i mean she's so happy and he's so happy baptize your baby wasting a lot of time for nothing and then after that you come and cook and hey baby baptism completely wasting time you know and someone comes and says i've been baptized they just use the titles on them and they're like ah yeah oh we have baptized them they even teach them how to speak tongues and they tell them you're baptizer now you have the holy spirit complete waste of time so but you can only be to the level of your revelation did you get the answer to your question hallelujah let's proceed he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches there is not one church age where this verse is not mentioned every single age has the same admonition to the people of every age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith but it is absolutely impossible for all men to hear what the spirit says to the different ages first corinthians 2 6-16 how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to naught but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory but as it is written i hath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which god hath prepared for them that love him but god hath revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things yea the deep things of god for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man which is in him even so the things of god knoweth no man but the spirit of god now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of god which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth but which the holy ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the lord but he may instruct him but we have the mind of christ matthew 13 13-16 therefore speak i to them in parables because they seeing see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing ye shall see and shall not perceive for this people's heart is waxed gross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear john 8 42-44 jesus said unto them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god neither came i of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because he cannot hear my word ye are of your father the devil and the lusts of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it it is most evident from these scriptures that no man of himself can hear god that ability has to be given him of god matthew 16 17 and jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou simon barjona for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven putting these verses together we see that there is only one group of people and that a very special group of people who are able to hear what the spirit says in each age it is one special group that receives the revelation for each age that is of god because the group that cannot hear is not of god john 8 42-44 the group that can and does hear what the spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof is that group described in first corinthians two six through sixteen they are the ones who have the spirit of god they are the ones that are born of god they are baptized into the body of the lord jesus christ by his spirit they are baptized with the holy ghost to further bring out what we have just said and to also use a scripture that should be born in mind as we talk about who it is that is baptized with the holy ghost see what jesus says in john 6 45 it is written in the prophets and they shall all be taught of god but turn to isaiah 54 13 whence this is taken and it reads and all thy children shall be taught of the lord the all of god are the children of god thus it is that the evidence of being a true child of god he whom the spirit has come upon and indwells is again set forth as one taught the word by the holy ghost now you can begin to see why tongues is not the evidence of being baptized with the holy ghost it doesn't say in any age that he that hath a tongue let him say what the spirit is saying that puts tongues interpretation thereof and prophecy etc aside as in evidence the evidence is hearing what the spirit says the spirit is talking yes the spirit is teaching that is exactly what jesus said he would do when he came john 14 26 he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you now some people misinterpret this but the banham never said that those who have received the holy spirit should not have the manifestation thereof you understand yes but he is simply giving a disclaimer because the wrong teaching given the foster realms they say the evidence the initial evidence that someone is feeling the holy spirit is science and diverse manifestation but then he says no manifestation cannot be the initial evidence that someone has been indeed filled with the holy spirit when you receive the holy spirit he will teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever jesus taught so in other words he will remind you the word of god whereby your life will be a written episode your writing will be a written episode read of all men why because you have heard the word you have believed the word and then when you you receive the baptism of the holy spirit the holy spirit positions your life into obedience of every one of god that that's the proof you see that's the proof that you have him and then indeed if you have him you must manifest him if you have him you must manifest the life okay so the manifestations must be there but you must also remember that the manifestations can be there for he that is um um one who is what's the word not a genuine believer you know he can also show manifestation i'm failing to get the word i was looking for you know huh not really a mac believer but uh somebody who pretends to be a believer when they are not you know they can try to mimic these gifts and the manifestation impersonators that's what i was looking for they can impersonate these gifts all the gifts that god has in his bank the devil can impersonate it healing prophecies miracles signs wonders tongues interpretation of tongues all these the devil can imagine it okay but it doesn't take away the fact that there is also the genuine one the real one and therefore that's what we want to see in the creatures of the living god um and that is just what happened that is how the gospels were written behind by the holy ghost the very words that jesus spake that is why the gospels are accurate they are perfect but the spirit did not only bring all things to their minds but he taught them further on the truth they already had that is how paul received his revelations he said concerning it but i certify you brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man for i neither received it of man neither was i taught it of man but by the revelation of jesus christ galatians 1 11-12 he was taught by the holy ghost one day when jesus was upon earth a certain important man came to visit him this man said rabbi we know you are a teacher sent from god but you will notice that jesus cut him short he turned to nicodemus and the words he spoke may well be paraphrased thusly i am not a teacher i am the sacrificial lamb for sin i am making possible the new birth by my spirit but there is a coming one who is the teacher he is the holy spirit when jesus was upon the earth he came as the lamb and as the prophet but when he came back upon the church by his spirit he became the teacher and to every age we hear the same truth he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit sayeth to the churches but only a spirit-filled man can hear the revelation for that age none other can no sir they cannot because that is exactly what paul said in 1st corinthians 2 6 through 16. now this ought to make you rejoice there is a most peculiar doctrine in the air that is causing much misunderstanding and hard feelings for when the pentecostals say you must speak in tongues or you haven't been baptized with the holy ghost they are either denying that great men like knox moody taylor go forth and others did not receive the holy ghost or saying that they all secretly spoke in tongues and were not aware of what was going on now that is not true no sir that is gross error tongues are not the evidence of being spirit-filled it is simply one of the nine manifestations mentioned in first corinthians 12 there is no scripture that says you receive the holy spirit speaking in tongues or that you receive the holy spirit by speaking in tongues but it does say that after they were all filled with the holy ghost they spake in tongues and later on it says that they prophesied today amongst many folks it is taken now before we continue on this uh i thank god that this question is put in here this in here is not written for you it's written for the others that think the manifestation is an evidence of the holy spirit they the accent when you give them the truth they reject it and they claim but i have the holy spirit already why because i speak tongues because i prophesy because i preach because i have the anointing because i i i have the gift of healing you understand in this message we have been told and we know from the scripture that the manifestation of the gifts can be hard can be held by the true vine and also the force divine because in the book of jehovah he says i'll pour my spirit upon all flesh now forgetting about the impersonators there is also this aspect whereby god anoints all flesh to manifest those gifts of the spirit they might receive the gifts but it is not the sign that they are indeed baptized into the holocaust they can be they have the it's the spirit of god yes but it's it is only simply anointing their spirit but not feeling their soul that's why someone the bible says that they come to him at that day and they will say lord lord did we do this in your name lord lord didn't we heal in your name between the liver didn't because of demons did he say you did did he say you didn't what did he say instead he said go away you do as of iniquity i never knew you in other words you do iniquity meaning you know the truth of my word but you rejected it you continued being women and preachers when you know the truth you continue to refuse to bypass in my name when you saw it people have been telling you the word is telling you you refused it so you refuse the word therefore i don't want anything with you yeah i know i manifested myself through you but that doesn't mean that you are mine i do not know you i don't own you you are not i'm not in you you understand but you had my gifts but i'm not in you it's like you young man if you want to marry somebody and you give gift here you give gift there give that it's not necessarily that whatever you give a gift to your money you know so usually you will choose one among all of them you know you know so it's also a story of esther you know it's a very good story how the others receive gifts but one of them becomes the wife only you know so but for you believers you know better for us believers we know better that manifestation must be a part of a true church incidentally and sadly some believers take portions like this and they must teach the people as if by the battle was against the manifestation of the spirit as if it was against the manifestation of the gifts of the holy spirit and using quotes like this but now you know granted that all who claim to receive the holy ghost by speaking in tongues speak in a genuine spiritual tongue but this is not so for many people speak in a known tongue but under the influence of a wrong spirit now let's say we are in a meeting and people are all speaking in tongues how can you know which tongue is from the spirit and which is from the devil i have been amongst the heathen where their wizards drank blood out of a skull spoke in tongues and interpreted and prophesied they can even write in tongues now if tongues is the evidence of receiving the holy ghost then every tongue would have to be of god but it has been admitted by tongues evidence people that there are false and true tongues for god has the genuine and satan has the false so my question is who knows what is real who understood the language to know what was spoken who has the gift of discernment to know now when we get those answers we will have something to go on but until then we have to wonder about the source of the tongues you can see right now that if you back up a tongue's evidence and don't know what is being said you have to finally come to the place where all tongues have to be of god that would lead us then to believe that the devil cannot speak in tongues that is not so no not for a minute any true missionary on a foreign field knows only too well that devils speak in other tongues the same as i know it by experience pentecostal theologians admit that they have no scripture setting forth that people speak with tongues when baptized by the holy ghost they admit that they infer it from the experiences set forth in the book of acts wherein three out of five times the people spoke with tongues and they also say without any scripture that there are two kinds the tongue you speak in while receiving the holy ghost and it is the evidence while later on if you believe you can receive the gift of tongues whereby you may speak often however they say once having spoken in tongues as the evidence of receiving you may never speak again once more we are anxious to know where this is found in the word if it isn't there then god hath not spoken it and woe unto him who would add to that word but there is something in the word about this very subject that they ignore completely first corinthians 13 it mentions tongues of men and angels these would be known and unknown tongues modern pentecostals say that they can receive the holy ghost speaking in unknown or angelic tongues they have the card before the horse for in acts 2 the people spoke in a perfect [Music] now when god is silent we had better be silent but where he has spoken we had better speak too and say what he has already said he told us the evidence or what would happen after being baptized with the holy ghost was that we would have the teacher come and teach all truth but that teacher was an inside teacher not an outside teacher if the spirit wasn't inside you wouldn't hear the truth and receive it by revelation if you heard it every moment of the day that was the sign of the indwelling spirit in the days of paul those who were filled with the holy ghost heard the word received it and lived by it those who did not have the spirit heard it only as carnal men put a wrong interpretation on it and went into sin in every age and every age is the age of the holy ghost for the true believer i say in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it i know it is a great temptation to refer back to the day of pentecost and also to the day when the holy ghost fell in the house of cornelius and then set those two identical experiences as the evidence of the baptism with the holy ghost but on each occasion the tongues were understood by the listeners this is a far cry from the modern battle of confusion of pentecostal meetings and if this were not enough to persuade us to leave off such reasoning what will we do when we are con fronted with the fact that people who have never spoken in tongues have some of the other eight manifestations in their lives such as word of wisdom the discerning of spirits a word of knowledge faith healing and even miracles and this observation is even more you cannot at least manifest if you're filled with the holy ghost i told you the other day you must manifest one of the manifestations you cannot just say you have the holy spirit and you are dry you he came to you when you are just dry you don't even know when you received him and you are just there no but you have it it is not true he said that people that never spoke in tongues they have some other eight manifestations in their lives but abandonment is trying to insist that yeah it's not true to say that the only evidence that someone has the holy spirit he's speaking in tongues you might as well not speak in tongues but you can have another manifestation he gives examples with word of wisdom designing of spirits word of knowledge faith healing miracles you know prophecies and stuff like that so the manifestation is many and when you receive the holy spirit he surely surely must manifest himself he's not a silent person if he comes in you he's not a silent person he comes to you like he's a quiet quiet person no he's not he speaks just like you you speak also even if you're silent you still speak so how come you tell me that christ comes in you and is silent from beginning to the end nothing happens there is nothing nothing but you have the holy spirit yeah the holy spirit the holy spirit these things are shouting these things of word of faith knowledge miracles speaking in tongues designing of spirits all these kind of manifestations because i for pentecostals but i have their spirit brother and sister that holy spirit of yours i don't identify anyone in the bible with it so you need to find out your roots what type of spirit is do you understand what i'm saying and by the banana continues to explain this part as he continues on down we our time is done but let us add a button to see what he says interesting in the light that tongues is the least of the nine gifts so when we see people who do not nor ever have spoken entire gifts than those who do speak in tongues we must discount such a doctrine even more completely than before so you can see now that we cannot afford to say what the bible has not said when scripture teaches us that the work of the holy spirit and the manifestation of that blessed person is to bring the truth of each age to the true seed of that age then we know that the spirit has to be abiding in the person or he cannot receive the truth for that time amen that is exactly correct and if these ages bring out anything they surely bring and bear out this truth now before we leave this subject i want to make myself very clear on what the baptism with the holy ghost is according to the word it is not according to me and it is not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the lord or we are falsely led amen to begin with you will notice that in my meetings when i have finished preaching an evangelistic service or some teaching message i cast the net and invite a response from the people i ask them to come forward and receive the holy spirit my pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that i am inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the holy ghost because they are already born again so when i invite those who are spirit-filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear ones surge forward and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to god and believe to speak in tongues this has caused a great deal of confusion and i want to tell you exactly what i mean i mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of christ by the holy ghost which is exactly what took place at pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost it is one and the same now i realize that it is going to be confusing for a moment here as most people know that i was ordained a baptist preacher and i have steadfastly declared that the baptists have missed it for saying you receive the holy ghost when you believe for that is not so you receive him since you believed acts 19 2-6 which says that when you receive the holy spirit you when you believe you have received the holy spirit already this is the first teaching i didn't hear anyone amen some of you believe me that kind of doctrine will say that you receive the holy spirit when you believe the message is a false doctrine it's a false teaching but a solomon have you not read you want to read with your own mouth please go ahead read it yes that question now i realize that the baptists have for say what did they say that you receive the word goes when for that is not since you believe meaning there must be a time after believing yes you receive him hallelujah not when he doesn't come as a full package when you believe that when you accept the message you have also received the holy spirit no after believing then you must receive the holy spirit hallelujah that's the right teaching of the word okay have you received the holy ghost since he believed and they said unto him we have not so much as heard whether there be any holy ghost and he said unto them unto what then were ye baptized and they said unto john's baptism then said paul john verily baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is on christ jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and when paul had laid his hands upon them the holy ghost came upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied there it is paul asked have you received since not when you believed and there is a great difference there for it is after we believe that we receive ephesians 1 13 is an exact word repeat of what happened in ephesus according to acts 19 in whom ye also trusted after that ye heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation in whom also after that ye believed not when ye believed ye were sealed with that holy spirit of promise now here is my point too many of our modernists and even our fundamentalists so-called believe unto salvation at a certain specific time which in many cases is called making a decision and that has been called receiving christ or being born again now to receive christ is to receive his spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the holy ghost amen these folks believe that is wonderful but they stop there you receive the holy ghost after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very first word of direction to the people was by peter at pentecost and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call these directions came as a direct answer from peter relative to what had actually happened at pentecost what came to pass was that god according to joel was pouring out the promised holy spirit upon all flesh he was not poured out before that time or given before that time this was it but this was to come from now on by repenting being baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and then god was duty bound to fill the ones who came peter or any of the apostles never said you must be born again and then filled with the spirit that this is the pattern of experience relative to receiving the holy spirit note carefully the very next time that the spirit fell upon a people acts 8 5-17 then philip went down to the city of samaria and preached christ unto them and the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which philip spake hearing and seeing the miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voice came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies and that were lame were healed and there was great joy in that city but there was a certain man called simon which before time in the same city used sorcery and bewitched the people of samaria giving out that himself was some great one to whom they all gave heed from the least to the greatest saying this man is the great power of god and to him they had regard because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries but when they believed philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women then simon himself believed also and when he was baptized he continued with philip and wandered beholding the miracles and signs which were done now when the apostles which were at jerusalem heard that samaria had received the word of god they said unto them peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost for as yet he was fallen upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus then laid they their hands on them and they received the holy ghost according to verse 12 they believed the word they were then baptized in the name of the lord jesus but according to verse 16 in spite of all that they had still not received the holy spirit it was only after believing and being baptized correctly but they received the holy ghost that is the exact pattern is set forth by peter in acts 2 38-39 another scripture that casts wondrous light on this is found in galatians 3 13-14 cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree that the blessing of abraham might come on the gentiles through jesus christ that in order that we might receive the promise of the spirit through faith now by no means can it be said that the blessing of abraham is the rebirth and that the promise of the spirit is the baptism with the holy ghost as two separate events for the scripture reads thus jesus died on the cross and by means of that death and resurrection the blessing of abraham came on the gentiles leaving the jews this transpired in order that the spirit might become available to the gentiles to understand what i have just said is to clear up why students have never ever found paul saying at any time be born again and then be filled they have inferred it is there and they have put their own meanings to make it say it but scripture does not say that jesus never said it either look at john 7 37-39 and read it now with understanding in the last day that great day of the feast jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me as the scripture hath said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water but this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified now it says here distinctly and emphatically that the believer upon drinking by coming unto jesus in faith would have rivers of living waters pouring out of him and it places this experience at pentecost now keeping this thought in mind we read john 4 10 and 14 if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saith to thee give me to drink thou wouldst have asked of him and he would have given thee living water but whosoever drinketh of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life this same living water is mentioned but this time it is not called a river it is called an artesian well there is where the people make their mistake because it is called a well and a river they think that in one place it is eternal life given by the spirit and in the next place where it is called a river implying a great dynamism it has to be the spirit now given as an endowment of power not so it is one and the same it is the spirit that gives life and power and that came at pentecost what is it that caused this misunderstanding the answer is experience we have gone by experience and not the word away with experience as your measuring line there is only one plumb line only one rod and that is the word now watch carefully and get this peter said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the gift of the holy ghost paul said have you received the holy ghost since he believed this is the whole of our problem right here people repent of their sins they get baptized in water but they don't go on and receive the holy ghost you believe unto receiving the spirit believing on jesus is the step in the right direction which is toward the holy ghost but the people stop there they go as far as water and then stop they believe and then stop the bible does not say that you receive when you believe it is have you received the holy ghost since you believed the exact and literal translation is did ye having previously believed receive the holy ghost the people believe and then stop you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe unto him having repented you go on and receive the holy ghost do you see it that is what is wrong with our fundamentalists they have no power for they stop short of pentecost they are like the children of israel who came out of egypt and stopped short of the promised land hallelujah that's why you know all things are by faith everything is by faith even what we are doing years by day when you go to pray you pray and believe that you will receive you know so just like let me ask a question sometimes we are closing this how many believe that their sins are forgiven how many are not sure how many are going to heaven how many are not sure what if someone was to confirm to you and tell you for sure they know you very well they know what you did and therefore you are still a sinner and all your sins are still on you what would you tell them they would say when did it happen where are you there at calvary how did it happen so he died because of your sins so if he died because of your sins were you there now how come that you say that you forgive your sins you believe it by faith period otherwise whatever you are saying someone will reason you out someone will risen you out therefore you believe by faith and you strongly believe by faith that you are forgiven your sins are washed away and when you repented you believed it has happened and it will happen yes not so yes in the same way you should master this in the holy spirit when you pray to receive the words believe you receive him not you might or may that you will receive him yes hallelujah remember before you got baptized and believed there was an atmosphere for you to believe and that atmosphere you created it you avail the time the willingness and the desire and the readiness to receive and you received the same way it has to be with the holy spirit the desire the readiness the availability that you you are availability your willingness to surrender everything else and live and forsake it and yield yourself to god then he must feed you with the holy spirit that is part of the change hallelujah can i have someone to close someone come on we are ready 19 minutes within our time past our time so we should close right away lord lift me up and let me stand by faith oh oh [Applause] [Music] [Music] i am [Music] oh let us jesus christ we are supposed to receive it since we believed in jesus christ they love you so much that they have to come yes you take us safely and protect us for us jesus christ [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] leave me [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you we shall meet again on our
