spiritual medicine Lord that we may be healed Grant I pray in Jesus name amen amen praise God so the this evening once again um I would like to greet you in the name of Jesus Christ amen tell your neighbor welcome in the house of the Lord amen so we are going to the Book of Malachi chapter 4 vers we just read that verse uh [Music] this is the last verse we read in our sharing last week and we've not really gone to explain on this verse but uh we'll be able to do that in the coming days Malachi 4: 5 behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the Great and the Dreadful day of the Lord am you may be seated so I also send greetings to the saints that are joining us on Zoom Lord bless you and those of you here in the fellowship also God bless you so uh we are continuing with our subject we shared on last week the ministry of Elijah in the end time there is a lot of a lot for us to talk about this subject so I'd like you to really follow follow with the much kidness the ministry of Elijah so the scripture we have read here in the Book of Malachi it speaks of the coming of Elijah and this Elijah that is being prophesied about is the one that is coming in the end time because remember Malachi is the last book in the Old Testament and you know many people believe this message but very few can be able to uh even read scriptures talking about the Elijah of our time it is highly likely that when you are asked you would say let me go and ask my [Music] pastor so please uh learn these things learn the verses understand them and then you can be able to give answer when you are asked many times when we talk about William Bram as the Elijah of the end time people think we're just cooking this from somewhere and that it has no Bible basis no Bible foundation and because we do not give Foundation enough to this many times people even fear to mention the name William Bram as the Elijah of the end time don't just accept that it is him without knowing why it is him you should know and that is why I'm taking this subject on the ministry of Elijah in the end time so by the by God's grace I expect us to go into certain things and last last week we were we were able to talk a lot about um uh you know Ahab because remember Elijah came at the time of Ahab but notice here he gives a prophecy and he says I will send Elijah the prophet so by this time we know that Elijah the prophet has already gone to heaven because he never died so he's not talking about the physical man called Elijah here he talking about the spirit of Elijah in the end time because God continues to use the spirit which was upon Elijah when we say the spirit of Elijah we don't mean the spirit of the man Elijah we mean the spirit and power the ministry of Elijah and the ministry of Elijah was functioning by the power of the Holy Spirit it was not of his own he was also relying on the Holy Spirit so really this is the ministry of the Holy Spirit working through Elijah so we see that God used Elijah in a mighty way and we read First Kings chapter 18 and I'd like to go through a little bit of it before we [Music] continue now th send and gather to me all Israel unto Mount camel and the prophets of Bal 450 and the prophets of the Groves 400 which eat at Jezebel's table so Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together unto Mount Caramel uh [Music] so now this was the time when um Ahab was the king of course time I took you through the history of Israel up to the time of Ahab King that was on the line of of the king Kingdom of Israel remember at this time the kingdom had divided itself into two great pieces by the prophecy of prophet aijah which came to pass through jeroboam when jeroboam became the pro the first king that would rule Israel not having been from the Lage of David is that amen so now we find that at this time you know uh King Ahab was one of the kings that came on that line he wasn't a son of jeroboam also he was a son um a son of somebody else I think um and and and you know but they were all not following after the laws of God they had back asleep you know on this line many kings came up most of them were war generals you know one dasty one comes up brings up a dynasty and it dies and another comes up and he dies and now it was time for King Ahab but you see God gives everyone an opportunity if they would walk in the ways of God God judges them according to what they do you know God is so gracious that he cannot judge you based on what someone else did he gives you your own opportunity and we find that Ahab also had this opportunity to walk in the ways of God but Ahab did not so what did Ahab do Ahab went and married uh a non Jew if you notice in first King 16 where we read last time also verse 31 it says and it came to pass as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam the son of nebat that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of E ethal king of the zidonians and went and served Bal and woried him [Music] I believe we all remember the sins of jeroboam what were the sins of jeroboam God told job I'm going to give you a sure house like I gave to David only walk in my ways only follow my Commandments and you will have everything you need and you will rule according to your the desire of your heart but what did job doob went after other gods and when he went after other gods God cast him God also rejected him and now we find here that Bible is saying King Ahab it took it as if it had been a light thing to walk in the sins of jerob he did the same things that jeroboam did he he walked in the sins of job we have seen many people in the Bible who are blessed by God but you know the blessing of God doesn't come to you by surprise if you want the blessing of God in your life walk according to the ways of God if you walk according to the ways of God it is a must you must receive the blessing of God but if you don't walk according to the ways of God you will never receive the blessing of God so now many people sit there and they wait to be surprised by God's blessings surprise I'm going to bless you no it doesn't work that way if you are going to be blessed by God you already know before it happens why because you are walking in the ways of God how many are walking in the ways of God today if you're walking in the ways of God I want to say the blessing of God is sure I don't even have to say God bless you because you already blessed because you're walking in the ways of God but King Ahab he took it light as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of jeroboam and he expected God's blessings so what did he do he took for wife the daughter ofel the king of thei and after that he went and served B and worshiped him if you marry an unbeliever it is almost sure you will worship other gods that is why Believers must always marry believers because nonbelievers will always bring their gods with them but you want to build your house on a sure Foundation you want to build your house on Jesus Christ you know he gave a parable of a man who built his house on a rock and another one who built his house on sun he said the one who built his house on sun when the rains came down and the floods went up the house went down but the one that build his house on the rock the rains came down the floods went up but the house remained sure because it was placed on a rock Jesus Christ is our Solid Rock Amen when we built on him when we are built on him we can never s we can never be destroyed because we are built on a sure Foundation we amen and this message is built on the Rock The Rock of revelation of Jesus Christ amen we are built on the revelation of Jesus Christ Jesus said I will build my church Upon This Rock and and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against so the Church of Jesus today and when I said the Church of Jesus it is a universal church I'm talking about men and women people who are built on the revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Christ is the word the opening of the word there are some who don't like it but we love it there are some who don't want to follow it but we love to follow it there are some who take it as if it is a light thing to do the things the word says we should not do but we take the word of God serious everything it say we want to do it because we are built on that Foundation that Foundation which can never sink but when the word of God say he should not M an unbeliever he said it is not important and he went and took himself a nonbeliever and when that happened he was introduced to other gods he was introduced to B worship because he married the daughter of ESB [Music] let me tell you brothers and sisters if you're not yet married never even have a slightest desire or even thought of Marrying an unbeliever if you have that thought or that mind God can never give you one of his until you are delivered you must be purposed that this is who I am this is where I am planted I am planted in the word I am planted on the revelation of the word and I am going nowhere else nowhere else this is where I am staying praise God all right so now then we find out that Ahab takes an unbeliever for wife and jeel begins to control the king you know at this time because the King was backsliding you can also say the country was backsliding Israel had backs the glory of God had Departed you know the king had took a heathen for a wife you know and you know there was confusion in the land but God still loved his people God always loves his people that are called by his name he does not leave them to be destroyed he always has a solution for them and in such a situation when the nation was in that situation God sent an Elijah Ministry anah Ministry came to prove where God was to prove what God desired prove what God wanted when Elijah comes he doesn't come with presumption he doesn't come with guess what when Elijah Ministry comes it is th sayth the Lord it is a sure Ministry a perfect ministry because it is speaking on behalf of God if we don't understand the importance of the ministry of Elijah we will not see the need for anijah in the end time but if if we see why God must send Elijah why God sent Elijah in the beginning we will know why God must send Elijah in our time because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever are you following me now so we notice here Elijah comes on the scene and Elijah tells uh King Ahab you are wrong the prophets of our time can they tell the president or the prime minister or the king of any country that you are wrong they cannot dare that the prophets of this time they can't do that even their association with the king or the the prime minister or the president a grand opport it is a cake for them they cannot let it go they associate with him for for what they receive and and and and what when he asks them should I do this say yes your Excellency God is with you go the power of God is you God is telling you th say the Lord God is because they money because they want Power because they want a brand new car because that is the other prophets but when it comes to Prophet Elijah Hallelujah when he comes he comes with that sayth the Lord he says it the way it is whether you like it or not whether is sweet or bitter he will tell you that that is what God says that is why people say the message is hard because this message is the message of elah it is not meant to be easy it is not meant to be easy is meant to be hard because it is meant to put the wrong things back to order that is the purpose of the message when we say the message we mean the message of elij Hallelujah God has given us that message again in this end time but before we see it in our time we have to see how it operated in the beginning praise God so Ahab comes and tells Elijah you have done Elijah comes and tells brother you have done wrong you know you you you you have to correct and Jezebel also comes the wife of the king says no this man here elah is misleading I am the true Prophet is the true God and Elijah is misleading so you see at that time when Elijah came there was a woman with so much influence and Power on on the king but there was a prophet with so much power and influence from the Holy Ghost so we are seeing two power walking parall to each other amen whenever you see the minist of el there must be Jezebel somewhere to oppose the minist of Elijah and the minist of Elijah will always defeat the spirit of jeze yes we see here Elijah tells say King go and gather to me bring all the prophets that serve your wife that Ser all of them if their God is God let us see today if my God is God we shall see it before the end of day so they gathered themselves 450 prophets oh my God vers one man [Music] Elijah 450 Prophets it is never about numbers and You Begin comparing yourself with other denominational churches I feel ashamed sometimes when Believers compare themselves with other denomination Church how doare you do that it's not about numbers it's never it's never been About Numbers Never are you hearing me child it has always been about the truth it has always been about the word it has always been about the spirit of God that is what we want to follow where the spirit of God is that's where the Eagles gather because they go there to for Spiritual manner 450 prophets they came and they gathered themselves against one man Elijah Who challenged them Elijah challenged them and they came and Elijah told them because you are many you are going to go fast put the Altar and um and um and put the bulock water and then call on your God if he answers by fire then your God is the true God so they started you know they did all the the things they had to and they started calling on [Music] their they said let us go in the spirit maybe they started speaking in they be excited no fire there's something wrong bring some knives want some BL and they brought knives and they said that's why I don't believe even our prayers should be like the Pentecostal prayers the denomination of PC the believer a Believer prays with Revelation before you pray you even know how and what to pray for read your Bible go to the Book of Daniel and see how Daniel Prayed Daniel Prayed Point by Point by Point by point he knew what to pray for and when the angel of the Lord came down Angel Gabriel told him exactly what he needed to know and his prayer was not just out of the blue it wasn't just excitement it was inspired by the revelation of the word and so he began praying by Revelation by inspiration according to the word he knew what to say just like Jesus he knew what to pray like sister she knew what to ask Revelation but these men they thought it is shouting they thought it's moving around and dancing and cutting themselves that moves the Holy Ghost no it is not one time there was a man called oh God remind me his name said you know I went to the William Bram meeting and we thought that the devil can't go unless you backed at him but that man he told us close your eyes now we're going to cast out this and he prayed he said Lord kill this child and th devil I command you to leave in the name of and said open your eyes the child has been delivered tell who was a preacher said how possible is that before he even backed at that demon how come it has gone said we were used that's what theil but I different I saw Jesus in that this thing is on YouTube go says that praise God and these people here they were doing the same thing they thought that when they dance and Shout too much then B will hear them but they were doing it without Revelation where are [Music] you you know like like like like the comedy they play the churches these days by the way we are seeing those same things today today why because Elijah is here again today some two Spirits are working the spirit of Jezebel is here in our generation but the spirit of Elijah is here again to restore us back again to the realities of the Living God hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and then as they cut themselves you know I will tell you why never answered even if was a living God some people have said oh no maybe they were worshiping the Living God but they didn't know they were calling him back even if they were talking even if they were to talk to the god of Elijah he would not have answered why the time was wrong number one number two the alar was messed up so the doctrines were all wrong and the time was wrong hallelujah hallelujah so God could not answer and could not even know what to do was already confused who can stand be who can stand before the king when is there and telling me that is going to work impossible and that's what we see on these comedian some of them calling themselves preachers you know for a sure the holy spirit is never for a never for a show that's one of the ways to know that preacher is a false preacher they come and they begin prophesying especially in Africa we have a lot of them and they say and then they begin calling their names and beating their chests yes I am Prophet whatever and then people shout and Believers I hope you don't have televisions and you are going to watch those kind of things you you're just wasting your time feeding on wrong Spirits that's not the god of Elijah the god of Elijah is a god of order he restores the true teaching first when they finished everything when they were just there they couldn't even walk do anything you are done now now I can start what time was it the Bible says it was the evening time it was time for the evening sacrif Hallelujah the Bible says in the evening time it shall be light oh my that is the time for Elijah to come on the scene that's the time for him to come and I told you evening time is also meaning in other ways end time the end of time we are living in those days we are in the end timeall praise God the Bible says there shall be time no longer it is going to be finished time no longer Time For What and time for what listen to me carefully it's going to be end of time for the sealed book Oh Glory to God Hallelujah the bride the true Israel will no longer read from a closed book but she will now read from an open book Revelation with understanding also because she has heard amen from the messenger of her age the Bible says when Amen in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God shall be finished not time for Mysteries anymore the Mysteries are going to be open are going to be revealed the seals are going to be open and the bride will have full access full access to the glory full access to the real God whereby that same God how do you know you have full access the Bible says he answers by fire that God Answers by fire and if you know you have access to him you will be baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire you cannot be called anymore you will not be a called believer you will be on fire for the revelation of the word brings fire it doesn't bring ice it brings fire and so Elijah he this was the evening time this was the end time amen time oh glory to God hallelujah God had to come down at that moment because it was the right time it was the end time of God Silence theend of Silence tell your neighbor the end time of God the end time of God is Sil from morning God was silent afternoon God was but in the evening time it shall be life the Bible says God Amen is light in him is light and there is no Darkness at all it was the end time of God silence and when amen Elijah came on he knew it was time for God to speak we are living in the time where God has spoken after all have spoken time for God to speak it was no longer time for B to speak about to it was time for God himself to speak through his messenger they were 450 doing the same thing but there was one Elijah doing a different thing all together oh my God and when he came he put the alar in order that's the first thing you see Al here means the doctrines the teachings because each Stone was meaning One Tribe of Israel so they had to all be in order in the right place in the right position for God to answer so Elijah he broke the altar he broke everything and he rebu it he restored it the the same alar which they were using he broke it and he rebuilded it you see the denominations have had some doctrines they have Tau for years but when Elijah comes he breaks everything he kicks everything he puts apart everything he comes and he says there is nothing like infant baptism there is nothing like women preachers there is nothing like baptism in in Trinity say from Hell who is this man he a minister of restoration it's a minister of Elijah coming to break the Altar and restore it in the right order in the right way it is supposed to be and we see him he came and put the alar in order and after putting the alar in order then he puts the B and everything them power praise God praise God Power Water they powered water they powered water the B actually says that water went even in the trenches everywhere they they had powered water and when he started praying praise God praise God and and uh he said do it the second time and they did it the second time and said do it the third and they did the and the water ran around about thear and they F the trench also with water and it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and say Lord God of Abraham Isaac and of Israel let it be known this day that you are God in Israel he wasn't just when you're PR I wonder whether you pray with ration PR with Revelation don't just matter or repeat words the Bible speaks of this wait until I talk about prayer see this man was praying with revelation and he was praying according to the word he knew what to say that you will touch God and that I am thy servant and that I have done all these things that Thy word hear me oh Lord hear me that these people may know that thou the Lord God and thou has turned their heart back again that's the ministry of Elijah to turn the hearts hallelujah hallelujah let them know that you are the Lord God let them know I am your Ser Hallelujah do you remember Gideon the sword of the Lord and of Gideon always two things there is no way you can believe the god of Elijah and reject you have to believe elah First in order to accept his message praise God we have had many people who say oh William Bram was a prophet he was used by God powerfully but he went astray do they understand the Bible if a prophet is a prophet of God he he he cannot go astray in his doct because he's a prophet not because he did Miracles he's a prophet because the word of God came to him if you read your Bible the Bible says and the word of the Lord came to Isaiah to Daniel so prophets are the ones that the word of God come to all right so then Miracles are only to vindicate that what they said was of God but these people they accept the Miracles and they reject the word but the bride believes the word that one makes us different we are interested in everything Elijah has to say because Elijah's message is a message to restore our hearts back again hallelujah hallelujah wow and so then the fire of the Lord fell read read it again verse 38 then the fire of the Lord and consumed the bur sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and licked up the water that was in the trench and when all the people saw it F on their FA they say the Lord he is the god the Lord he is the god meaning there is no other God but the god of Elijah hallelujah hallelujah the god of Elijah is still alive today the god of Elijah still Answers by fire today the god of Elijah is the only God and the people that have accepted the ministry of Elijah in the end they have accepted the true God praise God Elijah never came to start a denomination Elijah never came to start a following elah never came to start a church never started a denomination did you know that when El came the first time he never did that when El came the second time through elishah he never did when he came the third time through John the Baptist he never did when he comes the fourth time through William he never did that Elijah never starts a following Willam said I never preached the message said don't bring my message to bring up a following after me or to start some organization I bring it for one purpose so that you would have a personal relationship Hallelujah with Jesus Christ the message is not a denomination this is not another religion that's why we receive everybody and anybody we accept everyone to come invite them no matter how they look let them come to your church why because this message is for the whole world this message is for everyone that has breath for them to be restored back again praise God and so elah that's the nature of his ministry and came at a time when was under Jezebel Jezebel had taken grip on now today we are seeing the same same Spirit of ruling the church today you read Revelation 220 not with understanding I have a few things against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which call herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed unto Idols praise God so you see this woman Jezebel this woman Jezebel she always misleads the Servants of God she calls herself a prophetes she calls herself a teacher by seducing preachers and Believers to commit spiritual fornication what is spiritual fornication taking this Bible and they mix it up with traditions and ideas of man that is the spirit of Jezebel the spirit of Jezebel we have seen it in our generation it has come in a powerful way to even make the women physically be look and behave like her no wonder women in our generation especially those who are in church paint themselves what is that Jezebel was a heathen she was not believing in the god of Israel she was a Heen and because of that she she according to their Heathen traditions [Music] they painted themselves to look appealing to their people especially the men now we see that same thing in our own African traditions and also other countries sometimes people think that this is oh only our Africa even in Europe even in in in in India Asia all over according to the human Traditions the Heen Traditions they have always painted themselves it is not because of civilization even before civilization then people used to paint themselves different colors different this and that their lips they put holds on their they put Cs on their body in their ears and in their nose and on their tongue and everywhere I mean this is like ancient the Egyptians used to do it and all the other ancient civilizations it's not a new thing but see here in the Bible this was uh these were the zidonians they used to do this thing you know to to paint themselves and they called makeup so they used to makeup themselves and they thought it is a good thing but Jesus Christ one time was born and when he was born he brought another civilization to the world and this civilization Hallelujah is what we have received this Bible is not a white man's book the white men have rejected it even it is not a black man's book the black man have heard it for many years they didn't understand it it is not a Red Man's book or a yellow man's book this is the word of God hallelujah and it guides us into all righteousness and we see that in there we read about Jezebel a woman that was painting herself to attract men and we see the women doing the same thing today they paint their fces they put they pain their lips they pain their they PA all these things to look artificially [Music] beautiful in order to SC at God that they are not wonderfully men but when you hear the message of Elijah sister you are able to understand you are fearfully and wonderfully may need artificial Beauty you are beautiful naturally whatever you use on your skin matters it must just manifest Christ whatever doesn't change you it's all right [Music] whatever doesn't change you praise God cuz I had somebody oh you mean we can't even use lotion we can't even use we're talking about the spirit of Jezebel that changes themselves to attract men it's a spirit of fornication and uh I say my time is almost up I have about 10 minutes here but let me read you a little portion here I'll carry on the next time he says the first and the very important thing that we learn about Jezebel is that she is not a daughter of Abraham nor is her induction into the tribes of Israel one of the spiritual one of spiritual admission as as was that of [Music] Ruth the one that inded that her in the moabit sir this woman was the daughter ofba the king of sidon who was the priest of the he had gained the throne by muring his predecessor pH so we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer this certainly reminds us of Cain and the way she became a part of Israel was not through the spiritual channels that God had ordained for GLE [Music] admission but she came in by marriage toab the king of the 10 tribes of Israel now this Union as we have seen was not spiritual so there are many people who want to bring and make Believers by Mar [Music] that's not a spiritual it was political and so this woman who was stepped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshiper of the one true God but rather she came with V intentions of turning Israel away from the Lord if youel know nonbeliever will come with an avowed intention turning you to worship the but remember you are Sons and Daughters of ab according to the convenant now Israel the 10 tribes had already known what it was to worship the golden CES but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry God was woried and the law of Moses was acknowledged but from the time of ab's marriage to Jezebel I her to progressed in a deadly fashion if you want to progress in your backsliding unbel it will be a deadly progression it was when this woman became a priestess in the temples that she erected to aat or which is Venus and B the Son of God that Israel came to the crisis of her [Music] life with this in mind we can now begin to see what the spirit of God is setting forth in this thean church age here it is I have married Jezebel and he did it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and security that is exactly what the church did when it married under Constantin they both go together for political reasons though they put a spiritual air to it now no one can convince me that Constantin was a Christian he was a pagan with what looked like a Christian trapping he painted white crosses on the soldier Shield he was the originator of the Knights of Columbus he put a cross on the stipple of St Sophia's there by starting a [Music] tradition you see the Catholic Church doing it Church doing it they putting that cross on the step of their churches that tradition was begun by Emperor Constantine Emperor constan was not a Christian he oh he only married the church and politics for his own agenda and and the church remained blinded they they didn't understand what Constantin was up to Constantin actually with because of him even infant baptism started it was the year 325 ad in the third century when when they called all the believer the bishops come together in one place and out of that they began their own doctrines and traditions the church married with a state the Bible talks about it in the book The Church age of pamos and he says that's where Satan's Throne is when they had their one first leader of both the church and politics at the same time it is still here today in our generation that leaders has been continuous he's a political leader and a spiritual leader the pope of r the church and politics married it was like the marriage of Jezebel and it is a marriage meant to destroy the church with her spiritual fornication and the Bible speaks to church and he says I have one thing against you because you have suffered you have allowed this woman Jezebel which calls herself a prophet to teach and seduce my servants to commit forication this is what they have done in Our Generation by teaching wrong Doctrine by beginning Trinity Doctrine infant baptism by beginning all these ideas of man you know all these ideas of they were trying to suffocate and kill the church jeel squeezing life out of the church but friends I want to announce to you this is the same time God must send Elijah Elijah must come at the time when the church is almost dead he comes to bring a restoration he comes to bring amen the church back to its senses the ministry of Elijah is important don't joke with it it's not just a man or an idea of a man it's a Bible prophecy he says I will
