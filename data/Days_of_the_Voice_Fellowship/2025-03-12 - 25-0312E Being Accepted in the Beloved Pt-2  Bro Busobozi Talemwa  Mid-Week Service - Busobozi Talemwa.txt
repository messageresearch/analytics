demonstration of the gr it Lord Jesus name amen amen [Music] God bless you church amen shall we turn to our Bibles and today we shall just um we're going to take part two accepted in the Beloved and today we will read out of Genesis chapter 4 ver 7 Genesis 4: 7 I read in the name of the Lord if thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door and unto thee shall be his desire and thou shalt rule over him amen may the Lord bless the reading of his word I'd like to greet you all in the name of our Lord Jesus the Saints both here and also online just open our hearts this evening as we see um uh get get into the word and see what the Lord has for us amen the Lord has something for us tonight so I'll just carry on from where I start accepted in the belov I spoke um we read in Ephesians chapter 1 um um vers we can read reread it again just just remind ourselves just follow it in your Bible blessed be the God and the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world and we that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace are are you following me to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself so he has a pleasure that he has already purpos in himself he accepted you before you were actually into this world he chose you in him before the foundation of the world and he chose you to be holy he CH let me put it this way he chose you as a holy Vel he did not choose you as somebody who needed to be made holy he CH you holy so he calls you holy and this is regardless of what would happen when you come into the world the purpose of the preaching of the word is for you to know who you are and that's what we are trying to do this evening trying to remind you who you were before you came into all this confusion one of these glorious mornings I tell you we will leave this body of confusion get we will we will be able to step into this reality we are talking about sometimes when we talk about this reality seems as if it is so far but one of these days it will become material amen but for now we can be able to know that we have all the spiritual blessings in Heavenly blessing everything has been redeemed our soul has been redeemed we are waiting for the body to be changed and we are waiting for this Earth to go through its last cleansing and then we can be able to step into this real amen and so what we're talking about is something we potentially if it's what God says it is what God sees and that's what as preachers we are going to remind you about and and so he says according he has according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein in that Grace he has made us accepted in the Beloved of course he has made us to be accept in Christ he has made us to be accepted when you receive Christ you are already in you are in the Beloved so you are his beloved you know there's a scripture in the book of Song of Solomon says I am his beloved and he is mine and Banner Over Me Is loud praise the name of the Lord but here we we see in the Book of Genesis God comes down and he preaches to Cain and he tells him Cain if you do well will you not be also accepted now remember Kane as we saw is s Kan Cain was not chosen in him before the foundation of the world no he was not he was a seed of the serpent but here when God comes to Cain he even to Cain he does not preach condemnation so this gospel is not a gospel of condemnation it is a gospel of salvation for all those who will believe they shall receive but here he says if you do well will you not also be accepted and if thou doest not well sin lith at the door now you would you would say what did he have to do to be accepted by God did he have to do something many times we think there's something we have to do to be accepted by God I don't know whether you have ever asked yourself that question what can I do that I will be in the good books with God what can I do that God will do this for me what can I do and here God is very busy telling if you do well so tonight want we want to understand what is this that you have to do to do well to be accepted by God because it appears as if God is telling Kain there was something that he Kan had to do but I want you to remember Abel offered gave an offering gave an offering AB brought the best Kan brought the best so if it was about offering they gave offering but Kan was not accepting if it was about presentation he did the best presentation that but still he was not accepted if it was about dressing it was about the altar it was about keeping all the laws of sacrifice and worship had done the best but he was not accepted but God would go ahead to say if you do well won you be accepted so in other words there is something that you and I must do that we do not have to do there is something that we must do that we don't have to do glory to God there is an action that must be done that we don't have to do by ourselves there is someone else that has done an action on our behalf that we must do by accepting what he has done amen hallelujah amen in the book of Acts 16: 30 the Bible says and brought them out and this is a man you know of the prison and he said you know s speaking to the apostle you know after he saw the what the angel of the Lord had done open the prison doors and everything he had known these men are true Servants of God so he say son what must I do to be saved so you see it appears every human being wants to know what they can do to be so he wanted to know what must I do to saved it's a question that has been over the ages right from the book of Genesis all through the the New Testament in the Book of Matthew chapter 19 ver 16 he says and behold one came and said unto him now this is a person a man who came to Jesus now God in flesh he comes to him and he asks him this question good master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life so it's a repeat a repeated question over the ages everybody has wanted to know what can I do to be saved what I what can I do to be accepted what can I do to have eternal life to receive eternal life is to be accepted to receive eternal life is to be saved to receive eternal life is to be accepted in Bel but you see this you know prison God wanted to do something to attain it this you know Master want I mean this gentleman here wanted to know the Rich Young Ruler he wanted to know what good thing he must do to be sa but I'm here this evening to remind you there is no amount of Works amen there is no amount of works that we in ourselves can actually do to be able to attain this salvation there is no amount of works we could do before right from the days of Adam from the very beginning right from the very beginning When sin came into the world there was nothing we could do to bring Redemption to bring Salvation there was nothing we could do Moses had nothing he could do Adam had nothing he could do Abraham had nothing he could none of these Great Men of God had anything they could do to redeem the situation because remember Adam was sinless Adam was perfect Adam was the righteousness of God Adam was holy Adam was without blemish so was Eve but when sin came they fell short of the glory of God and so they needed to be redeemed back again to the original state but there was nothing that could do they and the generations after them the Bible says all of us are born in sin we have all fallen short of the glory of God there was no human being could do anything that's why John cried the Bible in the Book of Revelation he says John WEP John WEP because there was no man are you listening there was no man that was worthy to touch the book or to open the book to lose the seals there was no man wory but then the voice spoke to him he says fear not John there is one who is worthy there is one who is worthy and that's the lamb but he called him he called him the lion of the tribe of Judah he said he has prevailed Amen to take the book and to lose the S who is the lion the lion became the lamb amen he became a lamb of God he say John said Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sins of the world who is it it is Jesus Christ amen that's why he came that's why Jesus was born he came to do what no man could do he came sister to bring Redemption he came to bring things back into order he came to change chaos into order you remember you know the Bible says in the beginning amen you know God created heaven and earth and he says the Earth was without form and void and the spirit of the Lord who over the Earth you see I want to show you something and then God said let there be but before he ever said anything the spirit of God was over there and that is the same spirit that said let there be order Let There Be order when Jesus came he came to do the same thing he came to create a again he came to redeem the things that were in order let me tell you when when man sinned he went out of order and everything with him went out of order that's why a lion can eat you that's why you know you can go out there and a snake will bite you that's why you know you will you will be scared that's why we close our houses that's why we have wild animals and domestic animals that's why we fear certain things these days we even have an animal We Fear more than any other animal it's called a human being if you're walking at night and you find this human being you will just dark somewhere because you don't know what will happen he may be a murderer be a wit doctor he may be just a night dancer so you don't know what will happen so you are all fearful why nature is groaning there is something out of place nature is out of place nature is waiting for nature is waiting for to be redeemed again his original estate when man is redeemed everything will be redeemed with him animals will be Redeemed by the Bible says in the Millennium amen the lion will be led by a little child what will happen have been back again to the beginning before fall but I tell you what that Redemption happened more than 2,000 years ago we are just going through the phases of we're just going through the phases there are people that were redeemed when Jesus came and he died on the cross he redeemed me he redeemed you he redeemed as many US had the seed of God in hallelujah amen my my my my my this I tell you your heart up as I was studying I called brother Dan I said brother Dan this thing it is too good to be true I told him a few of them we just sat there and laugh like it sounds too good said will the people receive it can you receive it tonight amen we're just beginning now but we the Bible says in the book of Isaiah 64 verse 6 but we are all as an unclean thing talking about us in the Fallen condition we were all unclean things and all our righteous as and we all do fed as a leaf and our iniquities like the wind they have taken us away sin is inherent it is it is in us there is another law the law of sin the law of the flesh it somehow is embedded with us and you know our works of our works of righteousness are as filthy rats they cannot be accepted now he's talking not talking about sins he's talking about the good things we can do so in other words we remember in the Old Testament so in the Old Testament he has already rendered all the works the good works of humankind filthy listen think about what you can do that is good God says it is filthy it is as a filthy rug you know the rug you used to clean the toilet that's how your good works are think about it brother that's how your good works are so what amount of Good Works can we do that will offer us eternal life what amount of Good Works can we do that will make God accept us I said none [Music] none no amount of dressing no amount of where you keep your hair no amount no amount of Good Works to avoid what to eat to do this to do this that all those good works in themselves canot make us holy they cannot redeem us because making you holy means you are redeemed so if those good works could make any man redeemed Jesus died in vain but why did he die remember he died when all these works of the law were there this man who was asking him what he can do he had done all the good works of the he had never killed he had never lied he had never done anybody and now Jesus asked him he said go do all those Works he said I've done all of he said all right there is one more that is Ling now Jesus did not say don't do the work he said do them and I want to encourage you tonight do the good works do the good works hallelujah hallelujah the gospel we are preaching does not tell us to do bad works it tells us to do the good works work out your salvation with fear and tring do the good work but then he says after you have done all the works you are still filthy as filthy as every seen so then what must you do he said there is one more thing amen he says go sell everything you have give to the poor come follow me for fate everything give up the whole world Amen and follow me the man could not do it because the man did not have the most expensive thing in the economy of God it's called Revelation that's what K never had that's what this man never had that's what many Christians don't have they are doing good works but they are as Sinners as anyone else because they have no Revelation in all you're getting get Revelation amen amen hallelujah hallelujah I said hallelujah hallelujah in the book of Hebrews 11: 6 he says but without faith but without faith but our Prophet told us faith is a revelation of the will of God he say without faith it is impossible tell your neighbor is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that God is that he is and he is a rewarder of them that diligently so now without faith you can never please God without Revelation you can never please him how do we please God we pleas God by spiritual Revelation whatever you do it is revealed to you who you are is revealed to you whatever you did is revealed to you what AB did revealed to him that was the difference between AB andain Cain did Works without Revelation AB did what with Revelation if you have Revelation are you hearing me church if you have Revelation you will always do the right works you will always do the works that will move God that woman re by revelation by law it was not allowed for a woman with a blood issue to come people but by Revelation this woman said if I die I die I have to touch the H of his she and touched her and she knew how did she know by Revelation if I touch him I will be made and she re against all works of the Lord and she touched him and by faith she was healed and I said tonight be healed if you do anything by faith not by sight if you dress your dress by faith if you talk well by faith if you behave well by faith everything you do by Revelation it is revealed to you you will know the Salvation is easy it is not a set of rules I stopped looking at what people think about me from the it was revealed to me who I am I am who I am because of who he said I am I said I am who I am because of who he said I am not because of what I thought I did what I thought I could do but because of who he said I am and when that is revealed to you you stop pleasing people oh let me pray louder everybody can know I'm spiritual filthy rugs hallelujah oh let me help others and then I take videos so they can know I'm a good person the but you see if you do these things by Revelation all you puring yourself a great degree listen in the message it is I Be not Afraid now you have to accept it for your own personal Affair you say I am a sinner and Christ died for me and I am the one he died for so therefore for tonight I come on the basis of the shed blood and I accept my salvation knowing there is nothing nothing that I can do Within Myself and I am Holy and fully trusting him tonight and believing that he does save me according to his promise then you are no matter if you have a sensation whether you felt something or you did not feel if you have like that you are saved by Fai in a finished work at Calvary is not failed salvation is received by you don't feel it you don't see it you don't smell it you just believe it by faith you believe by faith you believe you'll be the rupt by faith you're waiting for the Lord to come by faith you believe you'll be changed by faith you believe you will overcome your sin that easily beset You by faith you know you are accepted in the amen amen hallelujah hallelujah let's look at the law what the Lord did in the book of Deuteronomy 27: 26 cast be he that confir not all the words of this L do them and all the people shall say Amen now the law C everyone that did not confirm that did not do all when you don't fulfill all the law you are cast so fulfill all of it or you are cast now let's first leave the blood we leave the grace we leave Jesus we leave all that we look at the works of the Lord how many here can truly say they have done everything God wanted them to do that you're perfect in all the instructions of the word can you lift up your hands none which means according to the law according to the instruction what the law is the instructions of God the law is Holy because God is Holy and the law is from God so the law is Holy and God has desired that you be holy as he is that's why he gave the law but you see no one could raise up their hand according to the law all of you us a c is the called the cast of The Lord all C why because the law is Holy and we in ourselves cannot be able to fulfill we do not have the faculty within us by our in ourselves to fulfill the works of so all of us according to the law we are out cast imagine if Christ did not if the blood was not sh imagine we will all be a bunch of C no human could be perfect due to that inherent sin we needed something better for our Redemption amen and in the book of Galatians 3:10 he says for us many are as of the works of the law are under the curse don't eat that don't do that don't speak that don't dress that don't feel that don't do that don't listen to that don't don't don't don't and as you you think you're following all the works of the Lord truly truly no man can here is what we can do in our human ability we can fulfill some some we cannot and that's why we now then go under the C for it is written cast is everyone that continue with not in all things which are written in the book of the law to do them Paul is now quoting theonomy but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by tell your neighbor the and the law is not of Faith but the man that doeth them shall live in them I am so glad I'm not just living in the works of the Lord I am so glad I am living above the Lord so glad I am not judged on the basis of the works of the Lord amen I am judged on the basis of what Calvary has done amen and that's why I am sure I am not pretending I am not presuming I am sure I am accepted in Beloved amen because I know Calvary it all amen amen and the law is not of Faith but the man that doth them in them Galatians 3:13 say Christ everybody said Christ has redeemed us from the cast of The Lord I feel like shouting tonight Christ redeemed me from the of the Lord being made a cast for us he was made a cast for me it is written CES everyone that h on a tree listen cast be everyone or any man that h on a tree so it means there is one that was cast there is one that was cast not for himself my brother but he was cast for us hallelujah hallelujah am he did all the works of the Lord one day he came and he told John he said we must fulfill all the work everything that is written in the books of the lord we must fulfill I am a lamb and every lamb must be come on John you must wash me because I am here to fulfill all the works of the Lord I am here to be cast I must become a cast so that I may set someone free I must become a cast so that someone else in my stage They will receive not work but they must receive my righteousness oh my my my my my this should make every old believer shout second Corinthians 51 for he has made him to be sin for us who knew noes never seen he knew not se he was tempted all right but he never seen because SE means un he believed every word he fulfilled all the works he never se but he became sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him now listen we might become the righteous not that we might have the right of some missed it not that we might receive the right but that we might become the righte of God hallu we have become Hallelujah we have become the righte of where is the righteousness of God right here I am the righte of God where in Christ in Christ I am the righteousness of God hallelujah hallelujah Romans 4:14 oh don't you love these friends it says for if they which are of the Lord be hairs if they are to be hairs then faith is made void and the promise made is of n because the law work right for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all I love this to all the promise might be sure to all the city oh my God are you are you are you following This Not That only not not that only which is of the Lord but to that also which is of faith of ab who is the father of us all as it is written I have met the father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who Quicken the dead and cth those which be not as though they were I was dead but I'm alive because he called me we were dead in our trespasses but God who is rich in must hallelujah amen who against hope believed in oh my that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old the Bible says Abraham's body was dead but he did not consider it by faith he looked at the promise our body might be dead it is not possible for us to fulfill the word by our body our flesh is weak our flesh may be de but by faith we are looking at the promise amen amen amen but he was strong he stered not the promise of God he not even neither look at the deadness of s was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also and therefore it was imputed brother that let me read that again and therefore it was imputed to him for rightness imput he did not deserve it but it was imputed amen amen oh hallelujah hallelujah but for us also to whom shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead even to us brothers and sisters amen it shall be imputed to us also receive it brother receive the righteous of God let it be imputed unto you amen because you believe Psalm 321 he says blessed is he whose transgression is Forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man listen to blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity you need to begin singing I am blessed I am blessed Everywhere I Go I am blessed I am blessed am I preaching to Believers tonight I am blessed I am blessed I feel blessed I know I am blessed why because I know he does not impute unto me he imputeth unto me righteous brother sister we are going to be in the rapture of this glorious I feel so good you are going to be the Rapture going to be we going to meet there why we are blessed bless is the manto whom the Lord imp hallelujah hallelujah amen oh the devil can H oh he can go to hell isn't it his place hallelujah amen now listen in the Book of Revelation of Jesus Christ Our Prophet says so the things are in the message it's not my idea no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and he to whom the spirit of God reveals them some of us know the things of some of us know who we are some of us know what happen where we came from where we are going we know the things of God because we have spiritual Revelation he has revealed them unto us then he came and he was asked why do you speak to those people in Parables he said unto you it is revealed butto them it is not revealed butto you it is revealed it is given to know the Mysteries unto you it is given unto me it is given unto the bride of Christ brother Solomon it is given to you to know amen we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truth of it but it is still not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there I love the example brother ephra gave last Wednesday you know he said if if sham writes a letter to his wife I love you and he sends his name to it and then as he some he gives it to someone to take it and as he's taking it drop it drops and someone else speaks it and he reads it I love you shame you'll be like what's this about yeah I love you yeah you throw down but when fa picks it I love you she will read between the lines he's now meaning this he's now meaning this he will see what is not even written she will understand beyond the letter the bride understands beyond what is written the bride reads it and she understands and reads between the lines amen amen the word has not been quickened to them the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 5:21 we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ he asks a question did you get it it says that we are we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him we may become the righteous of if we accept the fact if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sinful for us then we must also accept the fact that we by our Union with him we have become I don't have enough voice to shout that we have become the very righteousness of God imagine that our Prophet says if you accept that he became sin for you then you must accept the first is a fact he became sin it is a fact it is also a fact we have become the right of God it is a fact whether you feel it or not whether you see it or not Hallelujah it is a I am the righte I don't care what you see I don't care what you let me tell you what he said I am the righte of God Christ Hallelujah I am the right of God the devil has nothing to do about amen in Christ I am it say that he Jesus became sin for us hallelujah amen to reject one is to reject the other to accept the one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing to many people it is not real to the majority of God's children may it become real to you stop always thinking about what you did do salvation is beyond your works it is beyond what you've done it is beyond what you doing beyond what you will do when he chust me in he knew what I will do in my past present future but he still CH me and he CH me perect him nothing I do nothing in my P can change my identity it is just as a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us hallelujah amen that is what we are I am so glad that is revealed to me I am so glad the devil cannot deceive me I know who I am amen listen to this devil I know I've done many wrong things in the past that did not change my AG devil will say maybe tomorrow you will do something and I'll cat You by that even by that I am not identified I am identified in what he is what I am in him I am already accepted he accepted me in Christ already regardless of what is around me regardless of what will be around he already accepted you in him I am complete in him I am I am happy I am in I am ruptured I can never fall in come on church this is our identity Hallelujah give CL and a sh [Applause] amen and I want to finish with this story that we have told many times gives it in the message the church and its condition he says here some time ago about 100 years ago there was a great Christian he lived in the Southwest United States his name was Daniel Curry a wonderful man a godly man sainted man a real Christian a man that everybody thought so much of such a wonderful person and The Story Goes that he died or he went into a trans and he went into heaven and when he he got to the P Gates the caretaker came to the door the caraker came to the door and he said who are you and he said I am the Evangelist Daniel Curry I've worn thousands of souls to Christ want to come in this morning my life's journey is ended up I have no place to go now that's the way it's coming to you some morning he says see that's the way it's coming to you back coming to you that's G the holy spirit away from them not be gentle and tender anymore he will not be gentle tender anymore you haven't cried for years you haven't blessed I don't know when you haven't blushed or cried for years all modest is gone from you but it's going to come to you one of [Music] these and as the gentle Holy Spirit comes and Knocks why don't you let him may he allow us to let him in so when Daniel C come to the gate they went in said we'll see if you got if we got your name here they looked around they couldn't find anything said no there is no Daniel cry here oh he said surely said I am an evangelist he said I've WN souls to Christ I've tried to do the things that is right the caraker said I'm sorry to let you know but there's no Daniel car said I'll tell you what you might do we have no rights here to take your case he said but do you want to appeal your case you can appeal it at the white thr judge if you want to but he said we have no mercy here for you all because we don't have you here your name is not on the book there is no Mery for you he said do you want to appe your said sir what more can I do to appeal my case he said well then you can go to the white Throne judgment and appe your Dani said that he fa him himself going through the space for about an hour some of you that are planning to Amen to not go in the Rapture if you plan on missing the Rapture you are coming on the white thr judgment but I tell you what on the word thr judgment there is no mercy so he felt himself going through the space said he come into a place it Go lighter and lighter and lighter and lighter father he went the light at God it was 100 times thousands of times brighter than the sun ever shin and he said he was trembling trembling and he said when he got into the middle of that life he heard a voice were you perfect on Earth The Voice just came out of the light he said no he wasn't perfect did you always play honest with everybody were you always honest he said no few things began to come on to mind and he realized no he wasn't H he said no I guess I wasn't honest said do you tell the truth in every case in your life he said no I remember some things I've told was said then did you ever take anything that you that that did not belong to you anything money anything anything else that don't belong to you he other he was he was pretty good but he was condemned he said no no I've took things that didn't belong to me he said then you wasn't perfect he said no I wasn't said he was looking any for the blast to come from that light from where the rest that's what he was W that's what he was waiting for just then he had a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother voice he had ever heard said he turn to look the sweetest face he had ever s than any Mother's was standing there before him and he said father Daniel Curry stood for me on Earth it is true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me and now I I'm going to stand for him in heaven and a voice said take all of his SE take all of his and put them over on my heart amen hallelujah who is going to stand for you brother if you gri him a away today who is going to stand for you but I'm so glad ready now I am standing for him and because I'm standing for him he will stand amen when I come at the end of life's journey wary of life and all wor is gone then I Shall Behold Him Hallelujah the one who gave his life the one who surrendered everything and all the things that I did all the things I ever did in my life in that life before him will see as nothing because he would say put it on my account and that's not in the future this is what has happened for me what has happened for you he has accepted us in Christ Our beloved stand upon your feet oh Lord Jesus thank you Jesus for accepting me Lord thank you Lord Jesus for purchasing me oh god with your
