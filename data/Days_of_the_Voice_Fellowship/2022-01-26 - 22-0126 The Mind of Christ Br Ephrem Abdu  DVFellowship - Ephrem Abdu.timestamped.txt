[24:05] you know
[24:06] this world all the people have their own
[24:09] system to live life
[24:14] the world has its own way of system to
[24:17] organize their mind
[24:20] [Music]
[24:23] people or ourselves has our way of
[24:26] system doing things
[24:31] you know if you go another country there

[25:46] when we talk about sports
[25:49] there is an olympic game worldwide is an
[25:52] agency
[25:53] olympic
[26:08] he make sure he has separated himself
[26:10] from the family
[26:15] he makes sure he has hired the right
[26:17] coach
[26:19] he makes sure that he's eating the right
[26:21] nutrition
[26:26] [Music]
[26:37] a day
[26:39] he make sure he separate himself and try
[26:41] for that event
[26:47] and when he reached to that point
[26:50] it's not
[27:20] and make sure that this man can have his
[27:22] own fair play
[27:27] now imagine this this man has been
[27:28] separated from his family
[27:43] the player will tell him now you can run
[27:45] and you can win
[28:14] even
[29:02] [Music]
[29:43] [Music]
[29:51] is
[30:05] 55
[30:15] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[30:19] neither your ways are my ways saith the
[30:22] lord
[30:23] for as the heavens are higher than the
[30:26] earth so are my ways and my thoughts
[30:29] than your thoughts
[31:02] never think he's going to do it in our
[31:04] way
[31:07] people will plan their own plans
[31:11] and their plan will not be fulfilled
[31:14] because it is not god's plan
[31:31] to speak to the people
[31:34] he will tell them the future
[31:37] you tell them
[31:40] and he warned the people god has said
[31:42] this

[33:29] to rain
[33:31] and the world is going to be destroyed
[33:33] and set in the security now how come
[33:35] this man is god using this man
[33:39] if he was the right kind of prophet
[33:42] he will have understand
[33:44] that science has told us the desires
[33:47] will not reign
[33:50] just
[34:46] on
[35:01] god loves his people now he changes for
[35:03] now
[35:05] he comes as using kings
[35:09] he was using prophets
[35:11] now he's using kings
[35:13] through the kings
[35:41] didn't listen to him
[36:10] that he will not
[36:24] if you didn't respect moses
[36:37] and you didn't receive no time to do it
[36:40] he's a disgrace
[36:42] it is a disrespect
[36:44] why right people use their own minds
[36:47] [Applause]
[36:50] message
[36:52] hallelujah
[37:06] he's the last
[37:34] but
[37:48] power
[37:50] but they are relying on their wolves
[37:54] if we see in the map of lodosa
[37:58] in the middle of the cross
[38:02] where
[38:17] was the richest
[38:21] had an opportunity of growing business
[38:25] so that's why the bible calls them they
[38:27] are relaxed
[38:34] didn't use
[38:36] uh samsung his power he didn't take his
[38:38] power saturn
[38:41] he didn't take his strength
[38:44] he didn't attack
[39:28] because they have rejected the message
[39:31] they have rejected the prophet
[39:34] they are stuck
[39:37] they were unable to see the cloud they
[39:38] were allah and move with the clouds
[40:10] jesus christ is going to come and visit
[40:13] us again
[40:15] not to judge come again jesus christ is
[40:17] coming again not to judge yes
[40:22] he's coming again to give us you know
[40:23] mercy objectives
[40:26] the people are so deceived
[40:29] and will make them relax
[40:32] that jesus christ is going to come and
[40:33] heal the sick followers
[40:36] their ice
[40:49] yes they have ice
[41:03] to read the word of god
[41:15] let us have the mind of christ
[41:24] has its own way of making you
[41:28] hate the word of god
[42:00] oh
[42:14] but they can't
[42:27] many technologies

[43:35] word of god
[43:40] a very good place
[43:44] for a good palace

[45:01] god
[45:09] [Applause]
[45:16] read the word of god
[45:19] when you have the five cents
[45:22] aligned with the word of god
[45:25] you will hybrid and confuse the people
[45:27] yeah you will hybrid and confuse the
[45:30] people

[48:20] he gave them the prophet
[48:23] with the message
[48:25] he opened the red sea
[48:28] he gave the man a fresh manner from the
[48:30] heavens
[48:32] he opened the road and gave them a pure
[48:34] water
[48:37] he faced them he protected them
[48:39] [Music]
[48:41] they were unable to see him
[48:44] they were unable to recognize him
[48:47] [Applause]
[49:01] are saying oh this god you're serving
[49:05] you're going out no way

[55:05] and and david
[55:08] [Music]
[55:12] and david consulted with the captains of
[55:14] thousands and hundreds
[55:17] and with every leader
[55:19] and david said unto all the congregation
[55:21] of israel if it seems good unto you and
[55:24] that it be of the lord our god let us
[55:26] send abroad unto our brethren everywhere
[55:29] that are left in the land of israel and
[55:32] with them also to the priests and
[55:34] levites which are in their cities and
[55:36] suburbs that they may gather themselves
[55:38] unto us
[55:40] and let us bring again the ark of our
[55:42] god to us for we inquire
[55:49] so another congregation say that they
[55:51] would do so for the
[55:55] of all the people so david gathered all
[55:57] israel together from sure of egypt even
[56:00] unto the entering of hemath to bring the
[56:02] ark from kiljath jerim and david went up
[56:06] and all israel to back to ba bala that
[56:09] is to
[56:10] kjath
[56:12] jerem which belonged to judah to bring
[56:15] up thence the ark of god the lord that
[56:17] dwelleth between the cherubims whose
[56:19] name is called on it
[56:21] and they carried the ark of god in a new
[56:23] cart out of the house of
[56:24] abinadab and user and a hero drove the
[56:27] card
[56:28] and david and all israel played before
[56:31] god with all their might and with
[56:33] singing and with harps and with south
[56:35] trees and with timbers and with symbols
[56:38] and with trumpets and when they came out
[56:41] to the thrashing floor of
[56:43] of children user put forth his hand to
[56:45] hold the ark for the ox and stumble and
[56:48] the anger of the lord was kindled
[56:50] against us and he smote him because he
[56:53] put his hand to the ark and there he
[56:55] died before god
[56:57] and david was displeased because the
[56:59] lord had made a breach upon us
[57:03] whereof that place is called perez user
[57:06] to this day and david was afraid of god
[57:09] that day saying how shall i bring the
[57:12] ark of god home to me
[57:14] so david brought not the ark of of or
[57:16] the ark home to himself to the city of
[57:19] david but carried it aside into the
[57:21] house of a better or better or bad adam
[57:25] the guitar
[57:27] and the ark of god remained with the
[57:29] family of
[57:30] obedient on in his house three months
[57:34] and the lord blessed the house of obed
[57:37] adam and all that he had
[57:41] hallelujah
[57:42] i want us just to understand
[57:46] david is a
[57:47] faithful servant for the lord
[57:50] [Music]
[57:52] he
[58:20] david is a faithful servant for the lord
[58:25] because he loves the word the word
[58:30] because he loves god
[58:36] he was seeking for atom
[58:40] now
[58:41] is where people go and make a sacrifice
[58:44] what a tome is it a tom i don't know it
[58:47] in english
[58:57] when people
[58:58] uh wants to communicate with the world
[59:01] with god
[59:36] we read in the bible it says and david
[59:39] consulted with a captain of thousands
[59:41] and hundreds and with every leaders one
[59:43] way to summon
[59:57] god will use a messenger
[1:00:14] [Music]
[1:00:21] [Music]
[1:00:26] people use
[1:00:27] their own their own technology
[1:00:30] they will search they will search
[1:00:33] they will make a research
[1:00:35] and they will try to present god
[1:00:39] i will try to present this the true way
[1:00:41] the easiest ways that we can give the
[1:00:43] people
[1:00:47] that's why this bible is printed in many
[1:00:49] languages
