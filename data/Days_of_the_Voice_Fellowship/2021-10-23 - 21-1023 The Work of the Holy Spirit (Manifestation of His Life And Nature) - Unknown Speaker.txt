the book of colossians chapter one meditate again i'm happy to see you sister sarah i did not expect to see you this morning here because she's been sick we believe that our god is the healer of amen i see that several not here this morning but i see that christ is here this morning and i'm happy to see each and every one of you and the massaging food is such a normal community you know within each of you there is a leak of fire omani even the mystery which has been eid from ages from generations but now and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the me of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory is [Music] hallelujah you may have your seats may the lord bless you praise the lord come here hallelujah hallelujah are you happy this morning ask your neighbor are you happy did they answer you know ask them again are you happy yes are you ready for the word this morning oh you might take it for reach i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of those that are ready for the word this morning from the instability that was a big proclamation amen i mean let us continue doing that this morning i'm speaking on the manifestation of his life and nature the manifestation of his life and nature by the way we greet you also those who are on youtube now i'm still on the major topic the work of the holy spirit yom and so this morning i believe that we shall have a wonderful time too hey man i mean this book the scripture we have read in colossians and actually incidentally by the poly cup and crushed into a little bit of what i was going to speak this morning and i was impressed with [Music] so we notice here in colossians our support speaks [Music] [Applause] [Music] made it manifest for his saints and to whom the saints god has made to them known what is the richest of the glory of them of this mystery so there is something about this mystery [Music] and it is glorious we are right here i'm speaking to you he says it is rich and glorious and then he says what is this mystery because a german chino church this is christ in you know the hope that is vindicated in your life receiving the authority which adam lost that's the vindication if you have received a revelation of who you are book it and move forward and move forward now you'll get an argument you don't cry over something that you believe and where is the word of the ma of the messenger of malachi 4. sometimes we think that that message is restoring us only back to pentecost the message is restoring pentacles yes but it is also passing pentecost that hallelujah and christ if and he says and if christ be in you romans 8 10. the body is dead because of sin and the spirit is life because of righteousness hallelujah amen remember this is a glorious mystery if that same spirit dwell in you oh [Music] there is something secretly happening whatever the way it creates your mention in the mind i am being quickened every day every time what is she saying one of these days is the people spirit why right because adam was the life of his life the spirit of god was in heaven adam was in the image of god adam it's funny adam was a manifestation miami gustota submitted himself to others every animal in this world every creature everything that you see anymore that was created by god and he had to understand he was submitting himself to us why because adam was the king of the eyes adam was the god of the academy god is trying to push his own even those who are of his seed to go back into that atmosphere even when we are in the church like this you find them thinking about something else but when i got the chat because i want to cooperate with the holidays [Music] [Music] why right because of that atmosphere remaining you because of that nature and then he speaks now you get up hallelujah amen he was a man german too that's why he spoke to kill them but because whatever you speak commander should not show you together write that mercy you have that authority but you know we use your word it happens we must come to that realization we must is there will be [Music] [Music] it takes you out get the contemporary on honor that's when the devil has power to tell you you can't even pray because god will not hear you because he knows you have come out of your place your voodom is fortunate [Music] and he tells me to say young [Music] and we shall come to that crimson stream of blood i will treat you too cow therefore the lord god sent him from the garden of eden [Music] where did he come from he came from god javed but when adam adam left his place and he's seen adam was no longer the real adam adam adams that was taken from the ground he was now adam katiani adam that was given passed by a woman because do you think you are really a child of your mother but that was beyond that and symbols your faith has that name of faith the moment your vision is only reaching and stopping at your parents you will live a life amen that your parents can give you is going to integrate how can i do it my father my grandfather my grand grandfather every one of them had and he was only nothing he was not anything but adam so he drove out the man adam and he blessed at the east of the garden of eden cherry beans praise the name of the lord for him to be to keep the tree of life is it a man oh my congregation is divided some are saying a man others are saying [Applause] [Music] now what he is a man [Music] jesus yes he's the way that leads us to christ yes hallelujah the fullness we see that christ we have a christian was in jesus name yes reconciling the world to himself never can you see a day you get it now but you take it if that same spirit got raised dwelling you [Applause] it is the jam that comes from the seed he is yeah he is the word of god [Music] [Music] scripture was saying that you have a name that you are alive yet you are dead yes i hope that no one is here [Music] this is serious [Music] don't look at me and say oh sorry about you the bible says i believe man born of a woman because you have a few we were born that way twice a day what to do we were born that way about you you were born in seed we were born with the last tragedy we are born to please the devil in the jesus come yes you are that was that seat yeah [Music] everything that adam lost what jesus was yes we are cheery amen did you now get it oh she took it the kathy adam was the son of god adam was in the nature of god the life [Music] why yes adam lost the nature and life of god jesus was the express image of the invisible god yes these are not even creatures to begin with a sinner be turned in a choker jesus is god yes you can hold up jesus is god yes you cannot ponder if you believe it say it with me you're getting angry jesus is god yes he is not another person the second person of the prayer trinity i've [Music] foreign the bible has no one trinity god is one catholic oh god is the spirit i take a turn god has [Music] and if it is the my mother he had done he had restored us back to the beginning before the fourth year don't just look at me tomorrow tonight i want you to part in this service when you give him a service say no jesus yes restored the life you are coming i will yes [Music] [Applause] his nature and his ability i've got the life of god in me with me again i've got a life of god in me i've got a life of god in me everybody now i've got his life his nature and his ability i've got a life of god one last time oh i've got a life oh i've got his life his nature and his ability i've got a life of god need me amen the life and nature of god nobody wants not in heaven we cannot make manifest sometimes people when we say we want to create something or say something we speak it jokingly that's why things don't happen [Music] and he's driving now we're talking about and it took him only i think not more than even a year there was a normal category and there was no way it would happen in uh i don't know if it's about a biscuit you know what what there was one brother who was not um i think it was brother tom ray no there you are that tom ray he didn't have children yeah and uh and this was his son-in-law kathy his son-in-law come on yeah hey hey never mind is [Music] might give you your children one of them is coming to preach to us here again that could you want to rule in a few days confirm that that's [Music] then we can no more perish that god himself can perish you become the [Music] i am very or moving chibi but not the sin not sin but the form of sin i am by the chifana that in order that he might take the sin of the sinner away [Music] do you believe it really really come on now uh [Music] i have that that he has given me all my sins and bad days from them jesus took my sister [Music] [Applause] as you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh jesus took my sins away [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah you [Music] [Music] [Music] he says what a beautiful picture of christ from heaven that we love that we were lost and came and pursued the enemies amen hallelujah amen he was in heaven and maybe one of his angels father they have lost their glory but the entity was the nature [Music] jesus yes god himself came from glory oh all the way and he even captured the lost souls i reserved an isaac the ones the devil captured there is a satanist he [Music] i am going to [Music] never stand went after the things of the world and see and we then roll and run greatly like though we are falling you are saying the right word but not in the right way okay and i can be a son of god again the devil lost their satania jesus yes when the devil was still in heaven but he pursued hallelujah we cannot be overcome by this generation i don't know how many years i will leave i am gender i am going to heaven i have overcome the devil good day jesus yes hallelujah amen i have a reason to rejoice hallelujah i mean glory to the name of the lord uh versus okay so i want to hear these words very very clearly you it says gamba for those who are living [Music] can you feed it to all yeah good man according to the flesh [Music] set their minds on the things of the spirit in the world now the mind of the flesh is best in the world both now and forever because it pursues sin in the world the spiritual meaning the spiritual well-being that comes from working with god [Music] but now what [Music] sinful pursuits [Music] he is actively hostile to god and there was a movie never it does not submit itself to god's law since it cannot be gone and those who are in the flesh living a life that caters to sinful appetites and impulses you are not living in the flesh i am not in the flesh this is a silly movie controlled by sinful nature oh if in fact the spirit of god lives in you amazing directing you and guiding you the spirit of god directs and guides does not have the spirit of christ he does not belong to him and he is not a child of god oh my god [Music] and if christ lives in you era though your natural body is dead because of sin yet on the water your spirit is alive omaha christ jesus from the dead will also give life to your mother bodies through your spirit and our sinful capacity oh no [Music] did you hear that you have a sinful capacity well [Music] do you think you don't have the capacity of drinking alcohol do you think you do not have a capacity of having a girlfriend a boyfriend oh no was i totally nervous do you think because you preach the gospel we have no capacity of big things now to live according to the impulses of the flesh our nature without the holy spirit that could be common for if we you i are living according to the impulses of the flesh no way [Music] when you're still living here because you have a name that you live but you're dead each of us has the capacity to live according to the nature of the flesh but if you are living by the power of the holy spirit [Music] you are habitually put into death the sinful deeds of the body hey hungry for all who are allowing themselves to be led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god you have not received the spirit of slavery leading against the fear of god's judgment [Music] [Music] no matter how your father speaks i'm he says if you have not received he says for you have not received a spirit of slavery [Music] leading against fear of goddesses i've received a spirit of adoption [Music] i will never is [Music] i know my father will not certainly with help give me give me a punishment for sure christ there he says the spirit himself justifies and confirms together with our spirit again that we believe as we [Music] sharing his spiritual blessing and inheritance if indeed we are we share in his suffering so that we may also share in his glory for i consider kuwanga from the standpoint of faith [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] i have one more quarter to share very small and then the word moves on down into the body down into [Music] vindicating they are moving they are husband and wife they are flesh same oh some powerful words down there in that next question yes okay go up a little bit yes notice the vindicated word in his body is very is he is very victory the you are the body of christ we are the body of christ now the word vindicated in his church easy very victory and the reason for his death the death not in the spirit see when he died he only died in the flesh his spirit went to hell oh yeah preach the souls in prison finishing now quick and means made alive yeah he's the flesh which was his body amen and now what is it yes the first one was the first one the first one yes what is it brother what is the fast is the trumpet first what is the fast [Music] for the throne chapter 4. this you must know for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout out with a what okay with a shout out our guru what comes fast message it's been laying dead for years but it gradually began to come in the reformation and now she is standing upon her feet [Music] yes [Applause] is hear yourself what did i say you are the bride coming of jesus christ you are the bride the coming of christ brother you are the bride coming of christ yes the head to the body the word the body and the head is not the same no moving so when you speak category it is christ you have spoken christ you that one read it and now we are
