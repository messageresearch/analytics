please while you are still standing I'd like you to check your Bible the book of First Peter immediately and I'd like us to read verses six and seven championship first Peter 5 uh six and seven but it is and we are reading in Jesus name [Music] humble yourself yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time casting all your cares your care upon him for he cared for you foreign you believe that he cares amen tell somebody that he cares I um praise the name of the Lord now I noticed that today foreign you have come late all of you and so I can see you have a lot of chaos a lot of things that you are going through the military praise the name of the Lord amen mean yes I I have a note here there's a lot of cares I mean um casting your cares upon Him a friend in the time I will not belong as usual on Wednesday but I've been so much burdened to speak on this subject and I'm going to begin with a quote which I sent one of us and it was at a time that was uh a bit difficult for them but tonight I'd like us to talk about casting our cares upon the Lord why you know all of us here have cares if nobody wants at one point or the other in our life [Music] all of us have problems we go through things but here the prophet says in the message the mighty conqueror and the pressure is what he is when he is under pressure have you ever been under pressure raise up your hands can you go now we can see you now smiling we can see you speaking with your friends we can see you laughing but that's not really you now yes the real you oh yeah is when you are under pressure is when you are going through a tough time because when things are not going as you expected to go is when you don't have any money in your pocket when you you you have undergone a certain difficult situation [Music] is when you are going through problems is when you are down in the valley that is when we know who really you are a man is under pressure when a man we know a man when he is under pressure his real true characteristics [Music] to see whether there is any flaws in them I remember when we used to be in school especially high school and also the elementary primary you know you people would be there some of them they don't want to those who behaved as if they knew everything better than everybody else [Music] and you know before the government intervened to say that we shouldn't beat children government I remember that we had a teacher his name was Mr walakira to come after the exams have been given and the results are out so he would come with a big Road in the class [Music] Hallelujah I think brother we understand you need someone needs to help him listen to to make it a very good sound okay so and he would come with this road and then he would say anyone who is below below 60. I'm facing it rough today I'm going to give you 10 of them and he would even tell you a day before [Music] I tell you I'm marking your exams and I'm coming back soon I'm bringing your results anyone who is below and not none of you have even from what I've marked so far none of you is even above 40. anyone who is below and so precious would begin to go up precious will begin to go out everybody was worried because we did not actually know how many you scored but those of you who knew that I tried my best you know they were a bit calm and those of us who trusted in God said anyway the day will come and the day will go now so we will not get worried praise the name of the Lord I'm sure that most of you went through that but you see in life so now our life really human life is full of a lot of pressure but here what tonight what I'd like to talk about how should a child of God behave under pressure when you find yourself when your back is against the wall you know when you find that you have no hope what are you going to do again to cause a child of God praise the name of the Lord during times of distress when you have wants and needs you don't see anyhow you're going to meet them you need money and you clearly do not know how you're going to get it wait again and maybe your business is no longer working well maybe you've lost a job we can talk about [Applause] [Music] and I tell you people often do a lot of things you see you have a word you need to find comfortable you need to find consolation but you are confused you are distressed to emphasize this so we can understand you are heartbroken foreign right all of us here for normal you have been there before praise the name of the Lord people what did you do when you were in such times all of you can speak what you did but your mind mostly people cry what is wrong with you what if I can express what I'm feeling but I can't express when someone asks you what is wrong because we are going through a tough times as if someone has put them on a steroids how does they get angry you know you just talk to them they just sit back at you then you know I think he's distressed right I mean others they disappear or they forsake their responsibility find a father because he has no money we have many of us in our generation they leave the family there they disappear interesting because of what they're they're going through in their life they disappear my father was one that did that a lot of things that this distressed and depressed and he collected all of us in the home I am the fourth of five children and he said wherever I've taken you in school that's the best I can do [Music] now all of you when now you need to fend for yourselves and he disappointed us he left us with our mother nature they disappeared into things Allah saw him I last had my father in our home when I was 13 years old that's where I had to grow so fast and we have a lot of families like that we have a lot of children like that most in our society they've been for seconds why because they are fathers or their parents or their mothers they were depressed they were distressed they were in need they were in confusion who are thrown into you know garbage you find babies who are thrown on the road in the hospital why why because the mother was depressed and distressed and confused and heartbroken they will find consolation they will find a peace of mind you know others when they are in those situations they break down they become still you know you ask him what is wrong with you he can't speak to you you know have you ever been around people like that when they're depressed going through hopelessness they just become foreign [Music] [Music] you used to be happy they break down they lose their morals they lose their Joy they lose they they lose their enthusiasm this is how people different people react in the situations [Music] and the devil lies to them but when they do this they will find consolation they will find Comfort but yeah Comfort comfortable they think they'll find help you know others they say oh right now I feel like I can't understand I'm confused I'm put up let me go and take a walk into the nature just leave everything there foreign [Music] let me go to the forest somewhere when I feel that Forest when now we need our coming down oh I think I'll I'll be encouraged is that not true to be true people react that way it's about you and others just go to be alone if you you know when Daddy says I want to be left alone not even a rat can pass them you just know he's now he doesn't have money now he's confused I foreign [Music] [Music] when we are in such situations of distress trouble confusion when we are in need when we don't have money our own place when you are you know in Allah in one foreign [Music] as the pride of Christ we must always be found to be different from all other creatures you know if you were to be bad singers we are Egos and ego flies higher than any other bar um when you feel you cannot move on you feel you're confused when you are distressed my sister when you're troubled on every side what are you going to do I want to tell you there is only one thing foreign he is able foreign [Music] when is my God and his father we are telling him but Samson you are special you are you you are going to fulfill a purpose something you're going to redeem Israel assumption you're getting a new relationship from the moment he was a baby and he grew knowing that yeah but when the devil captured him next time because of lust for an unbelievable woman then the devil captured him they took off his eyes and they made him to make sport for them and oh man remember that brother as he was right there yeah they took him up after he has played games
