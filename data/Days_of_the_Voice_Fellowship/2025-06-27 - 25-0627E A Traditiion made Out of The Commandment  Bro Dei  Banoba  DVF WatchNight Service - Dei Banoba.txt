Tonight we're just having brother day come to minister to us. If brother day can come. Brother Day is the uh husband to uh sister. Is your name sister? Uh no not sister Sarah. Sister Sarah is the other one. Uh can you remind me your name? Sister Sister Deborah. Yes. Uh so sister Deborah has been with us for quite a while now. Uh maybe more than a year actually. So many of you know her. Can you raise up your hand so that Yeah, that's sister Deborah. Uh so uh she's been with us for for a while. And uh many of you don't know her husband. Her husband I think has been with us here uh for one or two services. uh but he's originally from um I don't know the district but uh in Busoga and then he moved uh here in Campala and he's been here in Kala for an extended period of time and so um by the day we first met I think um I first had an encounter with him I think I was introduced to him by brother she inve uh but I think he had been here before then and uh so I my my fellowship with him, I found him to be a good brother and uh one that really loves the Lord and I've never heard him minister before, but in my fellowship with him, I felt that it would be wonderful for us to get to hear from him and and to also tap the gift of God in his life. Amen. And uh so we pray for him as he ministers uh to us. He's um as I understand uh trying to start a fellowship in one of the areas um uh is it uh what's the name of the place? Yeah, n yeah starting a fellowship in those in those in those areas. Uh so we'll hear more about that maybe later after he has ministered. So let's u continue sing that song one or two more times and then by the day you just come right away. I don't is there? No. So we will if you're online and you need interpretation just type in the in the in the box there that you need interpretation then they can inform us otherwise we are going to go without interpretation tonight. Brother Langa is sec so it's understandable can excuse you for tonight. Amen. And uh then also a few brethren have traveled and others working in Oh brother Langa is here. Nice to see you. I didn't expect you tonight. You're really struggling. God bless you so much. And uh so also brother uh Joel uh you noticed even on Wednesday he was not here. He is working way up in the east. I think he he went up to um he was in Yanga and then from I think he went to another district. So we just remember him in prayers and uh but the Martin has also been working in Mitana for quite some time now. He's been helping the church in Mitana to tie up um uh the the sanctuary, part of the sanctuary. So I think by now he should either be done or getting done. So um let's remember those believers in prayers. Amen. Let us sing that one more time as as our brother day comes. Amen. I give myself away. I give myself away so you can use me. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away. Hallelujah. So you you can use me. I give myself away. [Music] I give myself away. for you and you. I give myself away. [Applause] I give myself away. So you My life is not my own. To you I belong. I give myself. I give myself to you. My life is not my own. You belong. I give myself I give myself to you. Let's give the Lord a hand of praising. [Music] You may have your seats farewell. I greet you all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And I I count this to be a very big privilege for the opportunity given to me also to stand before you the sense of the most high. I think pastor has already introduced me but I can again introduce myself because he has mentioned one name only. I'm brother day. I'm Austria minister of the gospel. I'm from Ubusa Cami district but he by the grace of the Lord Lord took me from there and he brought me this side and for two years I've been staying in Campala by the time we came to Campala I came to Campala my family was staying in Ukoto and then later alone we shifted to of course as we are staying in Ukoto the nearest fellowship was the koa church chand pastor Steven so we joined him and started fellowshipping with that church and uh I've been also ministering there many many times by the grace of the lord until late alone we shifted to way and when we shifted to we were having a little kid so my wife could not manage traveling that far distance and I personally I could manage. So for them I send them this side and that's the reason why they have been fellow from here for like a year. I want to thank the pastor of this place, pastor. I first met him when I was ina. I remember some good years back I think three four years and then but we did not have any conversation. Of course I did not get connected to him though he shared his contact also with us together with me also but ever since I did not communicate with him until when we meet in TV. It was one day I was at my workplace in then I received a call looking at it was brother B. I asked myself what is brother B telling me and where did he got my number? Then realizing later I was brother she who was with him. So they we are communicating with me for a business cases and later on we get we got into touch until today we've been friends with brother Bas. You are blessed with a minister who is nice. If I if I speak about nice, it is not nice in the appearance but is nice inside him. I came to realize that is having a nice spirit in him. I've been talking about this many times and with different brothers like brother Julius I was telling I brother Julius of I was telling brother Julius that I came to rec to realize that brother bus is one of the brothers having sweet spirit in them so you are blessed with that kind of a man of God. I thank God uh for this opportunity and uh I believe God will surely bless us. I've been ministering in many places. Uh brother Ranga you know Ranga but I don't know whether he remembers me. I I was with him ina when he had gone he had come for the introduction of my little sister and he was the MC brother Joseph of so brother Rang I've been knowing him for long of course before even that day I've been I had already known him before but again I'm glad to see you and uh I respect everyone I respect the ministers of this place. I believe they have been a blessing to us. I always follow your online services and uh I'm really also blessed. God richly bless you. Uh I request for your prayers after here I got another program. It was Wednesday morning. I received a call from Chi. What is that place? Choga. My wife can remind me. It is Chiboga. They called me from Chiboga. They having I I think it is a Thanksgiving service tomorrow. And they told me they chose me to offer that that service and by the grace of the Lord after here I'll travel to Chiboga. Pray for me for the traveling masses and God use me more. Uh, of course I will not talk a lot. I will not take much time in talking a lot. Only we shall go to the word I think and we talk about the word. Amen. Amen. Yeah. I've not walked I've not come alone. I came with my friend my brother brother Frank Olbo Frank Francis is my friend from Koku and I used to work with him until I shifted from Namasua. I'm so happy to see you brother and God richly bless you. He loves my ministry. Of course, he has ever attended my ministry. I think once or twice. So, you are most welcome and God richly bless you.

Father, even them that are online, Father, may you touch upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus. I commit the word into your hand, Father, as it will be going forth. Lord, let thy word be a bleeding word whereby it will be like the blood washing away our sins, cleansing us and taking away all the unrighteousness from us in the name of Jesus. May you, Father, unveil yourself before us. Speak to each soul that has come in thy house. Father, may you meet everyone, Father. And as you've made me to be a blessing to many and in different places I have gone to Father I pray that you do the same today grant a wonderful address to me in the name of Jesus as thy word will be going forth let there be a manifestation of the word of God because we don't serve an infido God but we serve a living God. Father, may you heal that sick, deliver the captive, touch them that touch upon them that are in bondage by the power of the Holy Ghost. May your anointing break every yoke, Father, that has been bounding thy people in the mighty name of Jesus. I declare healing and deliverance upon each and everyone who is airing this word. Father, will not remain the same in the name of Jesus. I pray that you use me. You have your own way through me in the mighty name of the Lord Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior I pray. Amen. uh straight away we shall go to the reading of the scripture but the pastor said we shall just use one language but but I have some few people that I'm expecting them to be following and some of them they may not catch up with us because of the language so I request If possible, we get one to interpret me. God richly bless you. Straight away, let's go to the book of Isaiah, chapter one. I'm going to read a common scripture. We shall read from the 11th verse to the 15th verse. Isaiah 1 verse verse 11. [Music] It is a very common scripture actually for the best for the good basis. Let us read from verse 9. [Music] I have my English version here. He says, "Except the Lord of hosts left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom and we should have been like onto Gula. Hear the word of the Lord. Ye rulers of Sodom, give ear unto the law of our God. Y people of Gula." Now the 11 is to what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifice unto me says the Lord. I am full of the burnt offerings of rams and the fat of the feed beasts and I let not in the blood of the blocks the blood of blocks or of the lambs or of he goats. When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand to trend my course? Bring no more vine operations. Incest is an abnomination onto me. The new moons and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies I can I cannot away with. It is iniquity. Even in even the solommon meeting your new monus and your appointed feast my soul hateth. They are a trouble onto me. I am weary to bear them. And when you spread forth your hands shall hide mine ears and my ears from you. Yeah, when you make many prayers I will not hear. Your hands are full of blood. Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil, learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, pray for the widow. [Music] Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Soch. [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Fore [Music] speech. might the Lord add a blessing to the reading of the scripture. You might take your seats. Yeah. As I've said earlier, it is a common scripture and I believe each of us has ever come across that scripture and uh I try to to to come with another subject but the Lord refused that he placed that message on my heart. And I don't know why, but I believe God will bless us through that. Amen. Of course, I know you already disappointed of the t of the because of the scripture I've read, but I've ever used it inside and it becomes a blessing and I believe it will be a blessing. Hallelujah. Amen. I've ever used it. Of course, it is a good scripture to be used in evangelism, but still today we're going to use it here. Of course, where we've read that was prophet Isaiah. And prophet Isaiah, we know him. He was one of the major prophets in the in the Old Testament. that God sent to the children of Israel. Of course, there are there are prophecies that we call major prophet and they are minor prophet. Amen. So, prophet Isaiah was one of the major prophet in the Bible and the major prophet God sent him when there is a need. Amen. Amen. God can't send a major prophet unless his people has turned his word upside down. Then God does something about it. It is when they when people of God has turned the word of God upside down, then God has got to do something about it. So it was during that time When the children of Israel had turned his word upside down, God had to do something about it. Just like in our day, God sent us a prophet, God sent us a messenger. Why? The church has done his word upside down. And God did not leave the church just anyhow. We had to do something about it. God can't take a man at a judgment unless he first won the man. Praise God. God can do nothing except he first reveal it to his prophets the servants. Hallelujah. So you had to send a prophet Isaiah in our day. You had to send the prophet the prophet to restore the word of God of the church. The church had turned his word upside down and God did not just leave eternal to do something about it. Then he brought forth the prophet and he restored the word of God and we are blessed and we share that passion with him. We are blessed people. We are blessed people. God has sent a prophet to us. Hallelujah. by way. And now and now when the children of Israel had turned his word upside down and Isaiah came on came forth on the scene and he started rebuking them. Hallelujah. Started rebuking them. I said to you people, God is tired of your sacrifices. God is tired of all the things that you do. He's tired of your moon. He's tired of your is tired. And he said even that he who commanded you when you appear in my court come with things. He said oblation is an abnomination. He said operation is oblation is an incases. Yes. An abnomination to me. And now listen the commandments of God that God again came down and rebooked them. Why? Because they had made tradition out of his family. And I want to borrow my heading today. A tradition made out of a commandment. Hallelujah. A tradition made out of a commandment. So when prophet Isaiah came, he stripped them. He said, [Music] "God has refused. He said it is become a stink in his nostril. Here in the message all things paragraph 81 [Music] said it he said it has become a stink in his notion. What was it? The feast that God ordained them to do. The very feast that God ordained them to do. things that God ordained them to do. These are the commandments of God. In other words, I want to tell you they are doing the right thing. Amen. Because it was a commandment. Hallelujah. They did the ordinations that God them to do. the new moons, the Sabbath, offerings of sin offerings and so forth that God had made for to to that that God had given to Israel. But they had made a tradition out of it. That's right. Hallelujah. They had made a tradition out of it. And God did not tolerate a tradition. But God sent them prophet Isaiah and he pulled he pulled no patches. He told them what they had done. You can read from Isaiah chapter one. you go home. I'm quoting listen and the prophet preached that he told them that he was a stick in his nose. In other words, God did not want their sticking sacrifices a sacrifice that they were giving. What had they done? They had polluted their sacrifice. They had polluted it because they had entered into it without sincerity. So they were not getting any result. Praise God. They were doing the right thing. Their feast was righting moon was all right. sin offering was all right but they could come without sincerity and such sacrifices God rejects and such sacrifices God rejects. Praise God. Let me tell you, brother said that upon every sacrifice, God requires sincity. Upon every sacrifice, God requires sincerity in the message of he said that if God is just and he just requires sacrifice, It just requires faith. It just requires membership. Membership membership of the church. If he just requires membership, if he just wanted sacrifice, then God is unjust. When he condemned Because a believer was aer sacrifices and he worshiped him said he knelt down even but God rejected him. Why? He was fundamental. just he knew things by and he was not sincere to sincere people. God reveals himself to them and God reveal God. Hallelujah. So God requires sincity upon every sacrifice. Hallelujah. God requires sincerity. So they had polluted their sacrifices. Remember let me take you back in the day after God had just gave them these commandments. People were sincere. The children of Israel were sincere. They could come with their off with their sacrifice with a sincere heart. Malach said brother said sometimes I call him brother that they could come for instance a sinner could come with his sin sacrifice. and bring it to the priest and tell the priest, "Do you I I I I sinned and this is my sacrifice." And they could use and if the priest could get a sacrifice and and sacrifice it maybe slew it while the sinner is laying his hand upon that sacrifice with that feeling in his heart a soul of sin. Oh I was supposed to die like this lamb. that God is accepting the substituting the priest is sacrificing and then the the sinner is in that kind of feeling and the life of the lamb, the life of the sacrifice which was worth to to be to be a living comes in the washer comes in the sinner and then the life of the sinner the life which was worth to die into that sacrifice and the sacrifice died and God accepts their sacrifice but later alone they got used of their sacrifice [Music] of the commandment of God could sin maybe on Tuesday and he's not caring about it and maybe on Sabbath he just get his lamb maybe just remember when he's going to church tomorrow oh I sing on Tuesday now I need a sacrifice but I have my bull there and he get it and he brings visit the priest and the priest sacrifice. Well, he's just there arrogantly is arrogant. He's not caring. He's not feeling that pain of soul. the soul of of sin having it and in such sacrifices they can't they can't get any result of amen. Amen. Praise God. When it come to peace offerings in the Old Testament when it comes to peace offerings many standard living at a low standard of living to bring forth pigeon doves. Amen. And then people that were in the middle class, they bring in he got They bring lamb and those people that are high, those people that are high, they could bring in things like a cow. But time came, time came and a rich man just comes with a lamp. That's true. He just offer it anyhow. is not sincere to the people that are sincere. They do according to the word of God. Praise God. Hallelujah. And I want to tell you sometimes I wonder I meet people who are not sincere even when they are believers. But they are not sincere. So these people they could polluted their sacrifices because they had entered into it without sincerity. He said your tradition coming with their traditions. I taken the power out of the commandment. Hallelujah. Amen. As soon as they took the word of God to be a tradition, the power of God came out of the word because the tradition is powerless. A creed is powerless. Hallelujah. Is powerless. And the word of God is powerful. Praise God. Hallelujah. So listen. Oh church of God. You see what makes ministers heartbreak. What the Pentecost when the Pentecost that God gave us, we've made a tradition out of it. I'm quoting the society has fed from the church. I don't say all of them. I thank God. Wasn't all of them, but the majority has loed sincerity. Praise God. Majority has loed sinc. And brother said that's what makes minister's heart break. I always said this that one one one one member of the church to get converted it gives a joy to the minister. Amen. Amen. I can say like this that if someone gets an encounter with God and the minister realize it is true that one can really spark bring his heart spark praise God. Hallelujah. So they had they haded their sacrifice And we see that the same thing with us today. And he says we are ashamed of doing the same. We are guilt of doing the same thing. We make a form out of it. Yet it is the commandment of God. Let me first emphasize this. Just like many Christians, I just wake up in the morning, but now I'm going to church. Just come anyhow. One day I was I I remember it was somewhere and it was a morning. It was a Sunday morning. I spoke to a certain believer and pray and go to church and the believer told me already I'm going to church to pray. Why do I need to pray? And I marveled because I know people that comes when they in the spirit, they are the people that God blesses in the service. It reminds me in the days gone by, the days of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Bible speaks about a certain man, Simeon. And the Bible says Simeon came when he was in the spirit and he came to the temple. And when he reached the temple, he saw Mary useful. people had brought their children to do as it was the custom. And then when he came nearer, he saw Jesus and he asked Mary to give him the baby and said, "Oh, this baby has raised for the for the fall of many of." Hallelujah. Amen. He recognized the Messiah. He recognized the Messiah. Even when the priest did not recognize him, why he was in the spirit, he came with the church. When he was in the spirit, he was spirit enough. He was preaching now that he could realize the brother was saying in the message is there anything to be he said Abraham was in the right atmosphere when God and Gabriel met him and as he was in the right atmosphere after he had prayed through the night and then he was able to recognize God that he was not just a man. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Praise God. He was able to recognize that this is not just visual. Says the prophet says the prophet says the prophet. Hallelujah. But here you find a believer just come to church anyway and when they come to church I told them to worship at least I've I've ever been here and I'm really blessed and I'm so happy that at least your worship has life in it has life in it. But I've gone to churches and they worship has no life. They tell people to worship. They just looking around. Tell them that we are now praying. Let's close our heads. People are busy looking. I've seen them sometimes when the Spanish they want to let us know that oh something has happened why they are looking around they say one time I was praying for certain kid who was sick was in in a hospital she was a girl actually she called Esther, very younger baby and her mouth has become just together. She could not open her mouth. The doctors could not do anything about it. I had failed it and I said when I went there it was just she was at the oxygen and then I requested the doctors to give me the loom because the oxygen looms for those children they don't allow more than one tender but I requested them. They first asked me, "Pastor, we failed. Will you manage it?" I told them, "Yeah, I've come. But I'm not going to manage it." God is going to manage it. And when I went, I to give me the war and I brought I brought people in. I first broke their their laws. I made the place to be a church. Put people in. I started sharing the word. Then I I told them let's pray. Start praying. Start praying. As I was praying, I heard someone say, "Oh, mama then I realized something has happened by those people that looks you them to close the eyes. I've just started feeling you now. [Laughter] You tell them close the eyes and for them they are looking around and you wonder and such people are in churches also. They tell them to pray and they are looking around. If they pray they will just speak some little words they are done. Ah and they look around. I saw people start marveling about others. Where did these people get words? It is you the problem. Praise God. It is you the problem. If you just want penetrate. ah things will change. Praise God. Brother said in the message going beyond the camp he said he was told that an airplane can't do what it is in it unless it goes beyond its sound barriers. But when it goes beyond it sound barriers will do what made for it to do say it is the same thing to a man of God to the children of God but they penetrates and God they can do what is in them where they are able they are able to do what is in them. They are able to overcome sin. They are able to pray to pray. They are able to worship. They are able to do whatever. Praise God. Hallelujah. But people you find them let's close their eyes. They are looking around. They want to say exactly what will happen. How will that miracle happen? We've gotCC enough. Hallelujah. When it comes to time of offering, you find a believer who has got something in the pocket, he contributes 20 [Music] and in the old time I've told you in the old testament people at a low level of they could bring pigeons, dove And then the middle the middle class and he goes and then those who are fine for them there. They are to bring blocks but I find a believer. One time I was in a meeting in a church And then brother who was at least ableuting piano was at least you could say they contributed 20. Yeah. And you may tell me such kind of people are they sincere? They giving with sincerity when it comes to tithing. Oh dear. [Music] A believer can get one M. I now culturate one M. I heard of a certain sister in a certain place. She got 5 million one deal 5 million or six million I don't know but the sister was faithful she got the tithe she took it to the pastor I wondered I said will he such believers [Music] but others will first calculate if I give him 300 something It is enough. We also have needs. Hallelujah. Amen. We've got to be sincere. If we are to get resources out of our sacrifices, we've got to be sincere. So brothers, they had polluted their sacrifices. because they could enter into worship without sincerity. Hallelujah. And now today our tradition is taking the power out of our worship. This is the prophet by our own tradition and we say that means Methodist. Methodist that means Baptist Baptist that's Pentecostals that's all of us together. Hallelujah. Your tradition has lost its power [Music] not because you did not do it but you did it without sincerity. Hallelujah. Yes, you've come to the church. Yes, you've come for for an overnight finite prayer. But if you are not sincere inside you feeling that kind of feeling that I'm going to meet God, even the Bible say, "Amen." Amen. that faith without faith it is impossible to believe to to to please praise God. The Bible said them that comes to the Lord must believe must know that their God is the reward that them that droently seek him. You must feel that my God is my reward. As I'm going for the service, he will reward me. He will bless me, will meet my need, will meet my problem. He's going to heal me, brothers, sisters, is the condition of the heart that makes the difference. Brother said, as he was talking about the men that were that received the baptism of the Holy Ghost before even the water baptism that is acts 10:44 said it depended on the condition of their heart and God said oh his people let me them even before the water baptist And they were [Music] they were sincere. Their hearts was in a right conditioning to be met by God. Glory. Hallelujah. They were in the right condition. Hallelujah. We've got to make the outer right. We've got to make the outer right before we call for the fire. at the mountain he first make the outer ring set the outer ve I want to tell you though Elijah was a true prophet of God if he did not make the outer race no fire could have come praise God and I'm making the outer region out of your heart. out of your heart, for God to meet you, for God to touch you, for God to come upon you for receive the bapt of the Holy Ghost. I'm preparing your Hallelujah. Make your out the heaven is ready to turn loose to fill you with the Holy Ghost. The whole heaven is ready to tal to baptize you with the Holy Ghost to heal you, to deliver you, to meet your need, to set you free. I have seen I have seen God doing miracles. God healing sick. Why the condition of the heart? Amen. Glory, glory, glory. Hallelujah. Amen. So we need to prepare our outer. We need to make our out. God is to come and fill us. Oh hallelujah. Amen. God is able to fill you. Even heaven is is ready to be turn loose. Amen. Amen. Amen. That you'll be filled. Brother said, "If David of the old time who was there before the the before the day of the of Pentecost, his cup runth over. If over, how much more shall it be with us? who has come after the Pentec [Music] that that when the Pentecost that he gave us, he we've made a tradition out of it. Hallelujah. We've made a tradition out. We've made a tradition out of of the Pentecost church. No real sincerity. No real soul for sin. People come up out and many of them take a lot of music and a lot of dancing and clapping hands just like that. No real sincerity, no real soul for sin. I've seen believers who come for at the outer actually those believers they come when they go after they had got them they come after them. Amen. Then they come and has come to confess his sin. His sin he knows it. But when you call him Oh come here and laugh my I pray God forgive me and you also forgive me. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. nor your soul for sin. Such sacrifices there is no result. Brother was saying confessed sin. God does not forget forgive and dry eye confession. God does not forgive. A dry eye confession. God does not forgive. There must be some soul. [Applause] But we've made a tradition out of the commandment of God. And I believe we are guilt of doing the same. Brothers, sisters, we are living in a day where people has got tradition out has made up tradition out of the word of God. But there some are just there not sincere not sincere. But there is somebody sincere in that. There is somebody got a genuine reason. [Music] Because he entered into it sincerely upon the bes of his face in the shed blood get the results people got results out of this. I have seen people who God touch upon who God meets. I know some believer does not believe in other things because they had made traditions. You find a church does not believe in in move of the Holy Ghost. If they see that, oh, those are Pentecostals. What a tradition. Oh, is a Pentecostal. You see, let me You see, let me tell you, I've grew up under this message and I have seen things that marvels my heart. Hallelujah. We grew up seeing churches lukewarm. They are just there. No real just sing these songs from the song book slowly. There is no difference in between them and methodist and we grew up thinking that that was message of the hour. We thought it that was the message of the hour. We used to think the message of the hour end is there. I just a song comes sing because the pastor the pastor preaches you offer prayer closing prayer you are dismissed. No real move of the Holy Ghost. your wash and in such churches you find no power of God there. Yes, there are message churches but there is no power of God. There is no move of God and we are not ministers of letter. We are not ministers of letter. We are ministers of the spirit of God. So the letter kills By the spirit gives life. I'm not a minister of the letter. You are free to choose the minister of letter. I'm not that kind of minister. Minister of the spirit. Whatever been preaching whatever been ministering. I've seen the demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost. People being slow down. Amen. And now there he believes in those things. Now that one is a Pentecost. If if you want quotes, I can give them to you. Brother Abraham himself saying that the Holy Ghost is here and the evidence of that he's here. I can see people speaking in tong. I can see people being slayed by the Holy Ghost. How can you take away that quote? Let me tell you, by our traditions, we've made this word of God to be powerless. We grew up thinking that that was what message mean. That was the meaning of the message. We are supposed to be humble just like the Catholic priest. [Music] But let me tell you brothers when I came at my age and started reading the message and God gave me a personal experience with him. read message after message realizing the message of our was beyond what I grew up seeing. Hallelujah. And immediately I started operating and I have seen real results. the mad people getting healed. Recently, recently I was ina they brought a certain sister to the crusade. She was mad, insane. And then as I was preaching on the crusade, at the end of my preaching, I started praying, I started praying. And the spirit ministered to me and told me just lay your hand upon the other sister behind. And I called her from where she was standing and she came near where I was and I laid my hand upon her started declaring. I told her your life is changing from today the Holy Ghost. Amen. And after declaring I told her your life is changing. Your destiny God is working upon it. She was married before. Then she got mad and because of madness, she could not manage marriage and she went and stay with her old mom. when she was brought in the crusade and I I declared those words after like three four days I received a call actually before I after the service people told me you know the lady that you've prayed for she's a mad and I said okay she's delivered after a few days. I received a call and they told me the lady was healed completely and she went back to her marriage. [Applause] I have the message here and I've received many messages and many calls concerning that testimony. Amen. But here you find church they believe in the miracles others they don't believe in that others they just believe in the bom of the Holy Ghost others in the in the thunders let me tell you I believe in all those things hallelujah I've got following me. Brother, he believes in them all. I do believe in them all. I believe in the baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe in healing. I believe in miracle. I believe in prosperity. When we speak about prosperity, are you a Pentecostal? That is the tradition. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. There are people that have entered into it with sincerity and I've got reason out of it. I've seen people feeling the being filled the bapture [Music] that they will meet him in the air. Amen. Let me tell you in a message a person experiencing brother said he was talking about the due. [Music] He was talking about the due he said the due every morning the due comes on earth every morning. But when the sun starts to come forth across the earth, you you will not see it. You will not see it. You will not when the sun starts to to come across the world that do start spunk start kind of sparkling. I'm saying if you only ask that why do you when sun is just passing by it will tell you that yesterday I was somewhere and this morning I came here and I won't tell you as that sun is passing by I am getting the the the the hope of going back where I was was glory I'm now going back where I was that person experience with God saying it is the same thing with a Christian that has gone to the unknown those people that had ever reached far they are sure one day when the son of righteousness shall appear shall appear and go across the world those people's heart will start sparkling they are going where there was They have ever been taken in the spread vision people does not believe in vision others does not believe in dreams but I won't tell you speaks about the three elements of humanity three elements of humanity, human. He speaks about those three elements of humanity and he spoke the about the first. He said it is personality. Everyone has got a personality. Even some person has got it. Personality is the access That that tells you that don't just cross the road. Don't just cross the Lord. Yeah. Then you have personality. You can greet people. You're a good citizen there. You have you have the personality and that's the first element of humanity. Then he speaks about the second one. He said it is faith is strong revelation of course faith is revelation of course. Amen. So he speaks about first stroke revelation. Some people just end there to revelation stroke of faith and that is wonderful. And he said the last one it is vision. Vision will not work in heaven. Vision works here. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Vision works here. Where you can be in a vision and see the plans of the enemy where you can be in a vision and be taken in the heaven like a brother. You people was taken to heaven. But when brother came, he said, "Oh, I can't preach this. I made another decision. He made another decision. A decision upon a decision. Amen. Hallelujah. And he said, "Oh, I can't stop this." After he had reached to heaven and he came to us. Can we speak about Paul? He was taken in the third heaven. You mean to tell me those things stopped from there? No. Just our tradition has limited us. Hallelujah. Just our tradition limits us. If you believe in these things, if you can only turn loose yourself from those tradition, I want tell you brothers, your face will be also turned loose. Amen. We've caged ourselves. We've caged ourselves. Cage from the word cage. What is cage? Brother Lord, it's like we've ced ourselves and we can't go in the eyes alone. We can't have results that really the world can look at and say, "Oh, wow. This is wonderful." I want to tell you, brother, we need a personal experience. We need to turn lose our soul and our lives will not remain the same. If we only be turned loose from the traditions that we have got then I want to tell you our faith will also be turned loose and it will be it will stimulate and I'm here to stimulate your faith. I'm here to stir up your faith. I want to tell you the same God At the day of Pentecost is the same God we serve. We do not serve infido. We serve a living God. Hallelujah. But we are caged by tradition and we cannot have the real results like they had at the Pentecost. His face was turned loose. He was not the same. He went forth and met the lamb at the beautiful gate and said feather and silver. Amen. Amen. God and what I have what I give you. All his fear had gone. He was free. We need to be free. We need to be free. We have got his people. We have got his elected them. The son has made free son made free need. We don't need to be like spies. Oh, I would have done this. But what would they say? Even sometimes it is an inspiration. But then you fear I want tell you I'm not a fearful man. me I just do things as I'm of course sometimes the judges farewell farewell but after times I realize he was he was on a right track hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I want to tell you. We need to be free. We are free people. We are sons and daughters of God. I always say I always say even the church order works when the Holy Ghost is not yet come at the Pentecost when the Holy Ghost came could make the church in order. [Applause] would just speak tong the church was broken. The church order was disorganized. Why the great order had come in at the day of Pentecost the church did not ask I want to tell you you deconies some of the donies the Holy Ghost is anointed of you you make you you you you pretend to be so busy until you try to deny announce the Holy Ghost. Some of the deaconist let me tell you be aware before doing the thing. Is it the Holy Ghost or evil spirit? Amen. I've seen many times as the Holy Ghost comes down just take people out. This is real. Some of you you are blessed. You've just come under the ministry of pastor Ber in the word. But for us who grow Hallelujah. To tell you the truth, I've seen this. I'm talking experiencing the Holy Ghost comes and do something different and then the brother, they got the the sister or brother and they take him out. I'm actually before that I want tell you I was one day in a certain service we had gone for the mission and as the brother was ministering the Holy Ghost came I slew two sisters in the service and then and then the new started I told And after that, I think after like two days was sitting somewhere, I was I think was eating lunch and then a certain minister said, "You see today the other demons that attacked the other sister, I prayed for her and I felt inside me Oh, if I can talk to this one. But I had to keep quiet. And then a sister who there there was another sister who was one of the team we had gone with just the brother. Are you sure I was evil spirit? Oh, holy ghost. Then I got church. I said now let me start on him. And I started giving him quotes. Brother saying, brother, I gave him a quotation and I want to give it it here. Brother said in the message spirit of truth. Amen. Amen. Amen. that God does something just from which we are used of. Sometimes God does something that is different from what we are used of and we denounce it at all. I'm brother B say where in in in where we are supposed to search the scriptures whether it is true or not we just denounce it those are Pentecostals you denounce it and brother said he said I think said one time that if it is of God, we let us not be found fighting against it. And he said, if it's not of the Lord, it will not out anyhow. out out anyhow [Music] because it is written whatever my father did not plant it shall be proed away better give it time it I'm done with you Hallelujah your pastor whistled to me here and he told me feel the liberty preach as you feel as you pre you you preach always. So there I got energy. I said okay. Some they get results out of it and others other only mocking in the message all things paragraph 91. Others are just mocking. And there was too And there is too much mocking going on today. Too much mocking. Too much impersonation. impersonations comp. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. That is it. And when Isaiah came on that scene, he put he spelled it out. And so said God said that he's hiding his face from your prayers because you've got your ritualistic form yet it is the truth. You are doing what he told you but you are not doing it in sincerity. And I want to say like this. We are in a straight the true message but sometimes we are taking the message to be something very small. Brother and sisters, this message it is a precious thing. It is a precious thing. It is a precious thing. And it did not just come in words. It came with that demonstration of the Holy Ghost. The message came with the manifestation of the Holy Ghost. This message come with the vindication. God always vicating it. And where are those signs now? Brother, sister, where are those saints now? Where are the lamb walking? Where are the dumb speaking? We are just we are in the message. Rapture rapture. Wow. Wow. Message message brothers quoted something. We are in a message. We are going for the rapture. At the end of it, the church becomes powerless. That spirit in the church age book. He said that the antichrist spirit will creep into the church and make it look for more palace for one day. Let me testify this also. One day I met her sister. She was to the pastor to a certain pastor. She suffered of her illness for long. I remember also using my small amount financial support to support him. Of course, the sister was in a district far from the district I was in later alone. the situation worsened and the pastor, they had to get the sister from the deep district and bring her to a general hospital in as believers, as brothers and sisters, as brothers and sisters, we went also to see them. I went with my a certain brother. We reached there. Of course, brother love should had to continue. We went to see the brother and sister. Reaching there, the pastor was not there and then we start of course we had some little conversation. brothers to me, can you pray? Being that she's a pastor's wife, do we need to pray? I said, really, do we need also? The same question came to but let alone I told the brother let us pray just as believers we are Christians we should pray as long as we've we've meet and then we shout some little words there and we prayed and we went away after like 15 minutes we received a call that the sisters pull out the witchcraft They had thought it was a normal disease but it was a witchcraft and now my my heart received a question pastor's wife is in this condition But for them they are there rapture rapture. Oh we've got a message and some say we don't need even miracles even when you are bewitched even when you are still bewitched. How can you bewitch me? There's something wrong. A pastor's wife bewitched. And the Bible says there is no witchcraft to Israel. And if Israel receives witchcraft because it explains itself, there's something wrong. And we are just in tradition. Now I think you've started getting something. Hallelujah. I saw you being got disappointed after reading the scripture. And always I want to disappoint people that's me times they receive me to pace and people they get disappointed totally by late alone God their their hope becomes a fresh H pastor did not tell me what time I've got to stop. [Music] enough. Uh I'm having time out up to when pastor am I still having some like 20 minutes. He said but okay let me went up listen God said so you be correctly in the word but if you don't do it with love and sincerity God said he would hide his face from you. And he would not hear your prayers. [Music] That's the way. Praise God. Hallelujah. Praise God. And now listen. God has a palace region. Amen. God hates a parasy. [Music] Any region today that has got Christ in has not got Christ in it is powerless. But every region that Christ is in and is under his blood and he's got power in it. Oh, you may say God hates a par hat without power. Yes, is a stink to me. That is God. He it's a paracy region to have power in it. I can even try to uritize it to a church. God hates a palace church that church without power. [Music] And then we are there. We don't need those things. We don't need miracles, yeah, we are far away, [Music] but God hates that powerless church. The church has got to have power in it. To be hated by God. Amen. Amen. and God will pour it out. And brother said the church that Christ claims to be his church with Mark 16 in action. Mark 16, what does it say? These sense shall fall them that believe. I want to tell you brother and sister this message is not a parish message this message is a powerful message it is from God and whatever comes from God is powerful God's word is powerful let us not limit his power let us not limit God by our tradition let us not limit God by our thinking Let us not limit God by things that we've got as rituals and masses. God is a powerful God. He's not limited and God does not change. He's the same yesterday, today, and forever. And our God is a God of spirituals. Let me speak about this. Our God does financial and what we call span. It is to do a thing which is above natural. What no man can think about that is what we call spiral. Where where the walls of Jero they required to crumble. They had to crumble by just a mere singing. How did the devil crumble? Hallelujah. Amen. How did they crumbled? Just singing me just going around singing and the walls had to crumble. How weak we are day. That is where God said or the scripture said that the rock give them water, a moving rock. And the Bible said the rock went with them through the wilderness, a moving rock. It gave them water. Water from the rock. Just as meat of the rock, it produced water. surprised the water to them and they drank. That's what we call spacual. Just a smid of the Red Sea and the Red Sea had to depart by a Smith where men like just came and stand before Golius with just stone. which I said glorious will be no more from today will be no more and he stood I always say he a great battle because of his faith and make it to be a child battle just children they wanted to face with stones But did not believe in the stones. His faith was in his God. His confession was that God does not deliver by many. God does not deliver by spears. God does not deliver by charity. He delivers by his name. Amen. I can see David coming up with the stone and he got a stone because he I I know he had no target. He was not perfect in target but he had faith. He got a stone and believed his brothers were there just mocking. His brothers were just smoking saying that brother is so prayed but his faith was in God and went forth. His target was not yet perfect and he just got a stone and put it in his string shoot and he casted it. I always say his target was not right. But God himself because of the f of came down and took the stone. He punctuate it. He blessed it and he added strength in it and he put down the shield. You mean you may tell me Godas was just stupid that he could not protect himself with the shield. But there was power that that got the shield. I pull it down and then it targeted him. That wasn't David. But the face of David and brother face no defeat. Faith knows no defeat no defeat. I've been rebuilding your faith. I've been just motivating you. I've been stiring up your faith. Now as you are as you turn loose yourself, your faith is turning loose. Your faith is turning loose. If you are lame, you are able to go back home healed. This day, this day is your day. If you're grandpas, this is your day. If you're dumb one, this is your day. I don't preach a powerless message. I preach a powerful message. This message come with power. This message come with the manifestation of the Holy Ghost. The same pill of fire. This message was followed by the pill of fire. This message had the pill of fire and the pill of fire is here. Fire is here. The angel of God is here to minister to you with your healing to minister to you with your deliverance. If you cannot read, can lose yourself from all the tradition from all the things that have been binding in your mind. Brother, sister, check your mind. Check your mind. The Holy Ghost is here to fill you. The Holy Ghost is here to deliver you. The Holy Ghost is here to touch on you. I feel the anointing. I feel the anointing. I feel it here. I feel the anointing. And the Bible say that anointing shall break the praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, glory. Glory. Glory. I feel I feel like traveling home. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I feel like traveling all glory glory region to have power in it. It's got to have and sincity brings power. [Music] Sincerity brings power. Sincerity brings power. Not for worship. Power worship to know that you've passed from death onto life. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. God want to perform his word by his power. And when the church denies his power, how can he perform and medicate his power? When the church explains it out and says, when the church explains it out, says for it was for other day, something. Oh, God wants to perform his work by his power. And my last quotation is oh you say sometimes people they say I went down there and there was a lot of power rather the floor was dancing in the spirit and not and there was no enough faith to heal the two sick. [Music] You're saying power but there was not even power to heal the two sick you call that power that's not power that's blessings people shouting enjoying the goodness of God. Those are blessings, not power. There is a lot of difference between blessings and power. [Music] And God makes his blessings upon the righteous and unrighteousness. But when we talk about power, we mean power. Hallelujah. Let us take what God means. We got to get back to the truth. Friends, we got to come back to what God means. If he says power, he mean his power. It says I I've given you power over the evil spirits. The Bible English version says power. So we can call it power. If if the Bible said given you power over the evil spirit, God mean power. Amen. God gave you power but the power is laying dormant by the traditionist. The power is just laying dormant. God mean what he says. He says what he means. He said power. This mean is power. He gave us power over evil spirit. And dumbness is a spirit. Dumbness. The Bible reminds me or speaks about a certain man who came the Lord Jesus. He first took his ch child to the apostles and apostles casted the devil and the devil did not go and let alone. He brought the child to Jesus and said to Jesus, my child as a a dumb spirit. The man realized is a spirit. Dumbness is a spirit. Deafness is a spirit. Hallelujah. Finance is a spirit and God gave us power over every spirit, over every evil spirit. I have that power. I have that power. It has been working in my ministry. And I want to tell you if you have any problem right now, I don't care if you are barren. If you are barren, the God that I serve is able to make that full room to one day was in a church in that is ginger. Last year, it was September, I went together with my wife and my family and I preached and I preached. They got a certain sister. There was a certain I can call her sister but she was a Muslim. Amen. She had come to the service people had invited her. The pastor told me that he told him, he told her the other minister God uses him. That is pastoral of pastoral. And when I preached, many people got healed. But I want to tell you this. The sister came on the prayer line and she told me, "I've spent five years in marriage, but I've never conceived." And I told her, "Do you believe? Do you believe that God is able to?" She said, "Yeah, he believed." And she believed. And we prayed. It was 1 September September last year and on 22nd December December she went to the past of that area and she told her I'm now in my fourth month. I can say she conceived immediately after the prayer. Uganda all that very week. Oh glory glory. That is the God we serve. Many many sisters I I remember of two sisters they already believers a demon tormented and one sister when I called for the prayer line she was behind and she ran out demon took out and people went chasing her and they brought her back to the valley and I casted demon. That was the end of that situation. Another sister, she was approaching where I was. She she started getting trembling and asked her what's wrong. She said, "I'm scared. I'm fearing." I saved those demons. Immediately the demons her and God delivered her. What are you talking about? Let us turn lose our lives from the tradition of this. I believe that one I don't believe that one. That one is it in the scripture. If it is in the scripture, you ought to believe it. That's what makes you to be a believer. If you believe a part of it and don't believe a part then you are not a believer. What are you? Answer yourself. We should believe all things and that same God is here. I want to tell you I was in church. I was preaching this very message and there was a sister who had the an who had the almness. She was having a pain in her leg. She said she has an invisible amness. 31 that day as I was praying as I was preaching after preaching I prayed when they were behind immediately the power of God touched upon her and she was healed she said she could not walk for male power of God delivered her spent 76 years with this and God delivered in that service. And when I called for the for people to come to be laid hand upon then she came and she just asked me to pray for her that she become sincere with God. She spent two weeks without testifying. She spent two weeks and one day she came. said, "I thought things were just dramas, but I don't understand this. I'm healed. I've seen the dam speaking. I during the season of co I was taken I I was taken to a certain family where there was a sister who had who was blind with one eye the other eye bringing tears the other eye started like that also. because she was expecting to become blind, total blind. But when I was praying, the power of God touched upon her. When she looked out, when she opened her eyes, she was seeing and she shouted. Oh, I see. I see. I remember her mama getting into the little into the small room and she got 20k and she brought and I told her We are freely given and we give freely buy for this for buy for that sister something to use. That is good. Can I talk about things that happened in where I'm going tomorrow even there was a a brother an old brother. He had also witchcraft and he had three wounds bringing pass. He said every night. How bad could get wet by those pass and he came in the service with that pain and I preached. After preaching, I prayed for him and he came and I prayed for him. I prayed for him. I told him, I believe all things are possible. I was on the crusade that night. Then he went back home. Back home. The pain had gone and the past had gone. The wounds got dry. Hallelujah. The wounds got dry. His bed could no more wet by wet. Amen. One time I was taken to a certain hospital in it is called hospital. [Music] There was a boy was in like five years. He had a wound here and the boy the pass full of that the pass was in that wound and the doctors could just get the cotton and put it inside and fix some pass. They had no hope of the boy getting well and a certain brother took me there. And I met the the family members of the family members to me was the man who was working with the other brother asked me pastor would the boy get healed. I said yeah. He laughed. But the Bible say brethren don't be deceived. God is not mocked. I prayed for the boy. I pray I went to the mom. I built the faith of the mom. I remember I remember talking to the mom. Mom was busy eating bag this sack of 500 could not give me and I felt in my heart if this lady could just Allah cannot me. and pay her undivided attention to me. The joy she would have got, it would have been beyond as I was sharing the word with her. She put the bag down and she looked at me and she paid undeided attention to me and started building her faith. I later to the brother, do you have anything to tell her? Brother said, "No, I perceived faith." Brother said, "She has got faith." And of course, also I was seeing faith in her, [Music] of course, when you in the spirit, you can detect these things. Hallelujah. I saw her got his face and we prayed without laying the hand upon that child days just the fresh started gathering coming together. After just a few days the boy was healed. The other man who laughed met me and told me if the day I would decide to to come to to the born again churches the day I will decide I'll just automatically come come to your church. I said the boy was healed. I said but for me I'm not ready to to become born again. He said but he said take all my children to your church and he gave them he gave them to us some we are youth like my brother [Music] for me I'm now of age. Hallelujah. Amen. So that is God and I want as I went up I will not say anything power is here. That same God is here. Don't lose yourself. Don't lose yourself. Don't lose yourself from all your denomination from all the things that you are told. told you even I grew up thinking that things that I used to see was the true meaning of the message of the hour. But the message of is so beyond is so far away. It is a far what you think about. It is far what you can imagine. It is beyond that what you know. Nothing can't happen. If you can only believe this message is far because this message it is not word only. It is God himself in the letter form. It is the Lord himself, the great healer, the great deliverer, the mighty one, all shall die, the Elohim, the everlasting, omnipl Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Lord. Let's get to that.
