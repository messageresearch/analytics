[0:00] that you wait upon the Lord
[0:02] I'm happy to see by the psalm God bless
[0:05] you
[0:06] and also brother Gideon God bless you
[0:10] thank you for coming and I'm happy to
[0:12] see every one of you
[0:14] these young men they've not been coming
[0:16] on Wednesday for some time
[0:20] but the day that we
[0:22] that we shall renew their strength
[0:24] they shall Mount up with wings as egos
[0:27] they shall run and not be weary they
[0:29] shall walk and not faint
[0:38] [Music]
[0:53] but even the youth shall faint
[0:59] sometimes we think you know when people
[1:01] are older sometimes they can lose
[1:03] balance and fall off
[1:09] and that's what happens
[1:12] the older ones the older you get the
[1:15] more vulnerable you are
[1:23] doing
[1:26] even they faint
[1:29] and even the youth be wary
[1:32] and even the younger men shall utterly
[1:35] fall nobody is
[1:38] meaning that to each of us whether you
[1:41] are old or young
[1:44] you are not sufficient in yourself
[1:50] you need an extra help wait
[1:54] you need God to give you strength and
[1:57] Grace
[2:00] sometimes we might be wary
[2:04] it is Spirit or in your soul or in your
[2:07] body
[2:08] and you need extra strength
[2:15] and you feel you need strength from the
[2:18] Lord
[2:19] so maybe you're faint foreign
[2:29] [Music]
[2:34] we will renew our strength
[2:37] as long as we wait upon the Lord
[2:41] we will always renew our strength
[2:46] so I'm speaking on waiting
[2:50] tell your neighbor waiting
[2:54] now there are many benefits of waiting
[2:57] foreign
[3:31] all right so all of you have stood in a
[3:33] line or in a queue and you waited for
[3:35] something my name is
[3:42] food someone was waiting for food and
[3:46] you know when you are hungry and you are
[3:48] standing in a queue
[3:51] you you can't pass the others that came
[3:55] before you
[3:57] even if you have ulcers
[4:01] and you you begin complaining around
[4:05] I have outside I'm actually feeling not
[4:09] well at all
[4:10] at least they should have let me pass
[4:13] if you try to pass somebody else will
[4:16] tell you please please
[4:23] and especially when here in Africa when
[4:26] someone has died
[4:32] many people who don't don't even have an
[4:34] association with the person who died
[4:36] they want to come and eat food
[4:38] [Music]
[4:42] and they are usually the first in the
[4:45] queue
[4:47] when even when they are last or in the
[4:50] middle somewhere
[4:52] they will try to sneak their way out of
[4:55] the queue so that they can be in the
[4:57] front
[4:59] because they don't want to wait
[5:04] [Music]
[5:10] in the bank more bank and maybe those
[5:14] tellers that really serve slowly slowly
[5:17] slowly
[5:24] 10 minutes 20 30. sometimes even one
[5:27] hour
[5:28] and you feel like fainting I remember
[5:31] when I was in Ethiopia
[5:35] my my wife I think we had about two
[5:39] children then
[5:41] and so we had Elizabeth and the ship I
[5:44] don't know where they're here
[5:47] so Elizabeth was very good at crying
[5:53] so when you would stand at um at the
[5:57] immigration queue
[5:59] immigration it was a very long queue
[6:03] but you know what I used to do
[6:06] yes I remember that time at that time my
[6:09] wife was pregnant for uh
[6:13] and Elizabeth was little
[6:17] also I carried her and I told my wife
[6:20] now we need to find our way to the front
[6:22] [Music]
[6:24] foreign
[6:57] Moroni
[7:04] so when when this man came he noticed my
[7:07] wife and then my child how my child rest
[7:09] how Restless my child was
[7:13] so the whole thing was a mess
[7:18] he told me he said please just go past
[7:23] so we passed to the front
[7:27] and and and at that moment I knew indeed
[7:32] waiting we were not going to wait no
[7:34] more
[7:38] praise the name of the Lord
[7:42] you know many people don't like waiting
[7:45] that many people are like me on that
[7:48] queue
[7:49] [Music]
[7:50] we have to make the baby crying we have
[7:54] to do everything it took to correct your
[7:56] nature thank you for us to go to the
[7:58] front and besides
[8:04] praying waiting
[8:08] is very hard for all of us
[8:11] many of us
[8:18] nobody likes waiting
[8:20] if you want something you want it
[8:22] immediately
[8:24] if you ask if you're a child and you ask
[8:26] your parents for money and you're going
[8:28] to school you want it there and then
[8:32] if you want a job you want it now
[8:35] foreign
[9:18] that was a person of substance
[9:26] nobody received what they wanted to
[9:28] receive there and events
[9:32] they waited
[9:36] and I'm going to take you down a journey
[9:39] tonight
[9:42] we will not be long as usual
[9:45] I consider myself not to be a very long
[9:48] preacher the network
[9:51] and so I trust that you will follow me
[9:54] along tonight
[9:56] foreign
[9:59] let us begin with a quote but the bottom
[10:01] says but it was done the Hebrew children
[10:03] but they never tempt the Lord thy God
[10:05] they was just thrown into it they didn't
[10:07] try to manufacture something
[10:15] and he says that's what's the matter
[10:18] with the Pentecostals today
[10:21] they are manufacturing something
[10:24] into they can't wait
[10:27] you see they are manufacturing something
[10:29] they can't wait
[10:31] and he says oh God they just can't wait
[10:36] so they commit adultery
[10:39] tell us to manufacture something never
[10:42] uses
[10:43] stairs
[10:47] and what does it bring forth
[10:50] like it did the first time the first
[10:52] bride that couldn't wait
[10:57] I will get deeper into foreign
[11:18] that is talking about Eve
[11:20] could not wait and because she could not
[11:24] wait
[11:25] she went into adultery again and then
[11:29] she was able to get bastard children
[11:34] and he says we all are a part of that
[11:38] okay I'll expound it as we go on but God
[11:41] came in the flesh
[11:44] but God Came In the Flesh
[11:47] to give us another birth at work God
[11:51] Came In the Flesh to bring us back to
[11:53] the original Sons and Daughters of God
[11:58] you see he says that
[12:01] um okay the lifespan of Eve never
[12:04] happened it never did why shimingo did
[12:07] kept it away instead of Adam coming to
[12:10] her for a bride when the time appointed
[12:13] would be
[12:14] just like Christ's will would have come
[12:17] to the group Christ would have come to
[12:20] his church he promised to do it
[12:23] I mean did you get it no you see Adam
[12:26] Adam was the husband to this bride yes
[12:31] and he was supposed to give seeds
[12:36] you remember what God promised Adam
[12:41] in the beginning in Genesis
[12:45] what did God promise
[12:48] he told them multiply
[12:55] and remember by this time Adam and Eve
[12:58] was not flesh and blood
[13:02] how are they going to accomplish that
[13:04] because
[13:05] just the same way that God brought forth
[13:10] his children
[13:11] by the spoken word because the spoken
[13:15] word is the original scene
[13:19] but what happened
[13:21] while they waited
[13:23] [Music]
[13:27] because someone told me oh if that was
[13:30] the purpose why didn't they have
[13:31] children before
[13:32] [Music]
[13:36] but you see that had not yet been the
[13:39] appointed time
[13:42] but before the appointed time for that
[13:45] to be accomplished
[13:54] and the serpent gave a better options
[14:12] do you know that we all are born as
[14:15] bastard children
[14:27] [Music]
[15:18] because each of you has that part of
[15:20] serpentine
[15:22] [Music]
[16:19] the reason was
[16:29] you see so she did not bring the
[16:33] original Sons and Daughters of God
[16:36] [Music]
[16:40] bastard children
[16:42] but here he says but God Came In the
[16:45] Flesh
[16:47] to give us another bar at work
[16:52] to bring us back to the original Sons
[16:55] and Daughters of God
[16:57] [Music]
[17:00] hallelujah amen and that's why they said
[17:02] no matter how evil we are or how bad we
[17:05] are
[17:07] you see as a child of God you must never
[17:11] accept to defeat
[17:15] you must never accept to be of the world
[17:19] you must never accept your temptation to
[17:22] overwhelm yourself
[17:24] you must never accept yourself to be
[17:27] done
[17:29] because there is one that was born
[17:33] in
[17:35] order to give me and give you another
[17:39] foreign
[18:06] foreign
[18:18] [Music]
[18:51] foreign
[19:20] [Music]
[19:28] [Applause]
[19:31] you see that's why we preached that's
[19:34] why there is preaching of the gospel
[19:37] because the preaching of the Gospel
[19:44] the preaching of the gospel
[19:47] songs free
[19:52] setting the captives free
[20:37] [Applause]
[20:46] that's what Jesus Christ has come to do
[20:50] actually he says that the spirit of the
[20:53] Lord God is upon me
[21:14] the purpose of Jesus Christ was on Earth
[21:19] so our soul that we are a victim of
[21:21] circumstances
[21:32] you see he made an unfailing way for
[21:35] those Souls that were in prison
[21:40] an unfailing way for them to be set free
[21:44] 30 minutes
[21:46] and how does it set them free by giving
[21:50] them a new bath
[21:52] by giving you a new back
[21:57] you may not
[21:59] someone may tell you against this
[22:02] message
[22:07] but we are the proof that what I'm
[22:09] telling you is the truth
[22:13] that God can still set Souls free
[22:18] do you believe you are one of those
[22:20] Souls that are set free
[22:23] praise the name of the Lord
[22:26] something is happening today with you
[22:29] know young people that wouldn't wait
[22:38] just a little bit
[22:39] all right so we see that some you know
[22:42] uh they end up you know because
[22:45] physically speaking now they end up they
[22:47] can't wait you know waiting for marriage
[22:50] waiting or you're waiting waiting or
[22:52] they can't wait
[22:59] so they end up in fornication and
[23:01] immorality
[23:05] but remember
[23:07] failing to wait like Eve's case has
[23:10] consequences
[23:11] foreign
[23:26] [Music]
[23:41] [Music]
[23:42] you are walking there with the Devil
[23:47] but when the consequences when the time
[23:49] for the consequences
[23:53] [Music]
[24:04] I'd like us to see an example here
[24:11] that did not wait
[24:15] turn with me to the book of First Samuel
[24:22] chapter 13. foreign
[24:58] let us begin from verse Five summary
[25:05] and the Philistines gathered
[25:07] themselves together to fight with Israel
[25:10] 30 000 chariots and six thousand
[25:13] Horsemen and people as the sandwiches on
[25:15] the seashore in multitude and they came
[25:17] up and preached in mismatch Eastward
[25:19] from Beethoven
[25:43] when the men of Israel saw that they
[25:45] were in a straight
[25:47] for the people were distressed then the
[25:50] people did hide themselves in caves and
[25:52] thickets and in rocks and in high places
[25:54] and in pits our Versace
[26:08] and some of the Hebrews went over Jordan
[26:11] to the land of God and Gilead as for
[26:14] Saul he was yet in gilgal and all the
[26:16] people followed him trembling
[26:31] and so the Philistine Army had come to
[26:34] attack the Israelites
[26:38] and you remember how Saul was chosen as
[26:42] a man to lead Israel
[26:46] of course it was at a time that Israel
[26:49] wanted to have a man to rule over them
[26:52] is
[26:56] yet God was their King
[26:59] and so God told his Prophet don't worry
[27:01] they have not rejected you but they have
[27:03] rejected me
[27:06] but you remember last time we talked
[27:08] about how Saul was elected as a king
[27:14] he was God that elected him and chose
[27:18] him to be a king I will not go in the
[27:21] whole story
[27:22] but then he became the king of Israel
[27:26] but now here I want us to look at souls
[27:30] he finds himself in a straight in a
[27:33] place
[27:35] where he needs to exercise waiting
[27:40] let me tell you to each of us Believers
[27:45] to each of us Christians
[27:47] we must always come to that place where
[27:50] we must exercise waiting
[27:54] but the question is how are you going to
[27:57] behave
[27:59] are you going to stand your ground on
[28:01] the word of God okay
[28:04] oh you are going to try and and go and
[28:07] take the easy way out
[28:11] I want you to see the children of Israel
[28:13] were following Soul they were all
[28:16] fearful they were all trembling
[28:21] and then they went on up to gilgals
[28:24] and so the Bible verse 8 says and he
[28:27] tarried seven days according to the set
[28:30] time that Samuel had appointed but
[28:33] somewhere else came not to gilgal and
[28:35] the people were scattered from him
[28:54] and it came to pass that as soon as he
[28:57] had made an end of the offering of the
[29:00] offering the of offering the bad
[29:01] offering behold Samuel came and and Saul
[29:05] went out to meet him that he may salute
[29:08] him
[29:09] and some will say what has thou done and
[29:12] so said because I saw that the people
[29:14] were scattered from me and the thou
[29:16] cameest not within the days appointed
[29:18] and that the Philistines gathered
[29:20] themselves together a at mismatch
[29:21] thereafter said I the Philistines will
[29:24] come down now upon me to gilgam and I
[29:27] have not made supplication unto the Lord
[29:28] I forced myself thereof and offered a
[29:31] bad offering
[29:37] foreign
[30:29] and verse 12 says therefore said I the
[30:32] Philistines will come down upon me to
[30:33] gilgalan I have not made supplications
[30:35] unto the Lord I forced myself to have an
[30:37] offered about offering and someone said
[30:39] thou has done foolishly thou has not
[30:42] kept the Commandment of the Lord like
[30:43] God which he commanded thee for now
[30:45] would they Lord have established thy
[30:47] kingdom upon Israel forever but now the
[30:49] kingdom shall not continue the Lord has
[30:51] sought him a man after his own heart and
[30:54] the Lord has commanded him to be Captain
[30:55] over the over his people because thou
[30:58] has not kept that which the Lord
[31:00] commanded thee somewhere then
[31:29] foreign
[32:05] the children of Israeli
[32:08] as I told you they were all shivering
[32:10] and shaking
[32:11] [Music]
[32:13] and they came following their kings
[32:17] and soul knew very well that he was the
[32:19] king
[32:21] but he was not the prophet
[32:24] he was the king not the prophet
[32:29] but as as he stood there in gilgals
[32:32] the prophet had told him to wait for
[32:35] seven days
[32:38] it was the work of a prophet to give or
[32:42] offer sacrifice
[32:43] [Music]
[32:47] amen and then we see that as as
[32:51] someone who tarried about somewhere I'm
[32:57] imagining the Bible says for seven days
[33:14] you see this is how children of God
[33:16] fight their battles
[33:20] you you must give an offering to them
[33:24] that's why we come in the church to
[33:26] praise him to cry for him to jump to do
[33:28] all these things to hear the water we
[33:29] are giving an offering to them
[33:35] and so as they were they were up in
[33:39] gilgals
[33:41] the
[33:43] prophet was looking I mean the King was
[33:46] looking around
[33:49] the prophet was not coming yeah okay
[33:52] just wait for the second character the
[33:54] second day
[33:57] the
[33:58] third day
[34:07] what was that what was the last day
[34:12] was the last appointed day okay
[34:18] of waiting
[34:20] the last day of waiting
[34:23] was the seventh day and you're not
[34:26] saving his completion
[34:28] so there was their waiting was going to
[34:32] be complete in seven
[34:35] is that right are you following me seven
[34:40] some the end of waiting
[34:45] so the the the king waited
[34:49] for six days and then when the seventh
[34:52] day arrived at your room he waited but
[34:56] as the day was about to end
[35:01] this prophet
[35:05] foreign
[35:07] [Music]
[36:05] foreign
[36:06] [Music]
[36:18] foreign
[36:46] I'm smiling because I'm waiting
[36:56] do that
[37:04] you're just moving
[37:07] I'm imagining this is how King Soul was
[37:13] he didn't even know where to swim
[37:42] let me give it myself
[37:44] that was a mistake
[37:48] did not wait
[37:51] and when they brought the offering the
[37:54] man gave it to himself
[37:59] maybe didn't even know how to cut it
[38:02] just bring that down
[38:04] big sword
[38:09] okay so the other thing
[38:15] pushing the fire
[38:20] and he was tying an apron on himself
[38:23] and then the prophet arrived the Bible
[38:26] says at the moment
[38:45] this King could not wait long enough
[38:52] and then the man of God was hungry
[38:56] when the prophet arrived
[39:10] because the king the prophet knew
[39:14] what the king did he was so previous to
[39:18] the Lord
[39:23] the prophet knew what the king did not
[39:25] know
[39:27] it wasn't just about the sacrifice
[39:31] it was also about the right anointed
[39:34] anointing for the office
[39:39] you see you may feel like you want to do
[39:42] something even better than your pastor
[39:43] sometimes
[39:47] but the question is I is that your right
[39:50] office
[39:55] you are more knowledgeable than your
[39:57] father or singer that I am against you
[39:59] are better than your mother you want to
[40:02] even do everything and devise everybody
[40:04] around oh yeah
[40:05] but is that your right office
[40:09] you always have to wait or you know and
[40:14] while waiting you submit to Authority
[40:19] and at that moment the king the prophet
[40:23] what have you done
[40:27] a king was but uh you see on my knee
[40:31] I saw the people were scattered
[40:34] and you were not coming in the days
[40:50] who are you to say if God wants you to
[40:54] wait wait
[40:55] [Music]
[40:57] foreign
[41:37] [Music]
[41:41] and now you're saying I forced myself
[41:45] he was impatient
[41:47] he didn't wait long enough
[41:53] and the king the prophet said
[41:56] someone said unto soul
[41:59] you have done foolishly
[42:04] you have not obeyed the command you have
[42:05] not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy
[42:07] God
[42:09] and now the kingdom would have been with
[42:11] you forever
[42:14] but according to what you have done
[42:17] your kingdom shall not continue
[42:22] the Lord has sought him a man after his
[42:25] own hammock
[42:28] [Music]
[42:29] seven is a number of completions
[42:33] it might seem that summer was no longer
[42:36] coming to fulfill his place
[42:40] but it was foolish for Saul to stop
[42:43] waiting
[42:46] and where are we today
[42:49] we are in the seventh age
[42:55] we are in the last day
[42:57] we are the last day of waiting
[43:02] the very last time
[43:05] I seem as if Christ is not going to come
[43:08] Christian
[43:10] but he told us he is going to come back
[43:14] again
[43:16] we are not going to be like those who
[43:18] don't believe that paid
[43:20] we don't want to be impatient
[43:24] we don't want to live as though Jesus is
[43:27] not coming back
[43:30] we want to live as though we believe
[43:34] that on the last day on the last day of
[43:39] the seventh gentle generation
[43:43] there was the first age
[43:45] that was the second age
[43:52] that God was dealing with a gentle child
[43:55] foreign
[44:13] [Music]
[44:26] expecting Grace to abound
[44:31] don't allow the devil to preach to you

[49:18] the Bible says that the day of the Lord
[49:20] will be as a thief in the night

[53:14] that you're going to spend eternity with
[53:16] you

[56:21] to the pastor
[56:23] and then when you go to the pasta you
[56:26] find there is no one is that forsaken
[56:29] house
[56:33] maybe the pastor has gone somewhere with
[56:36] his family
[56:37] let us go on Sunday at church
[56:49] you will find one or two people
[56:52] and the deacons will not be there
[56:57] the minutes
[57:03] and then those of you who find yourself
[57:06] you'll realize you have one thing in
[57:09] common
[57:23] come to think of it
[57:26] who are the others
[57:29] I don't know it's the money where are
[57:31] the others I don't know what happened
[57:34] and then one of you will think about
[57:40] before you tell the others
[57:54] before you even want to say
[58:01] foreign
[58:17] [Music]
[58:19] [Applause]
[59:02] foreign
[59:21] those who will not wait that are in this

[59:26] foolish virgins
[59:31] while some of us have gone to glory
[59:34] and I tell you what I believe with all
[59:38] my heart I am one of those that will go

[59:52] belongs but I know where I belong I
[59:55] belong in the Rapture I belong in the
[59:58] coming of the Lord
[1:00:02] so that he can give me a new birth in
[1:00:05] myself
[1:00:09] on fire for the coming of the Lord
[1:00:13] praise the name of the Lord so friends
[1:00:17] make friends with those that you will
[1:00:19] spend eternity
[1:00:24] check your phone list
[1:00:27] when you spend most time with it
[1:00:30] that's the one you will spend eternity
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:36] wherever they are going is where you are
[1:00:38] going to
[1:00:40] remember
[1:00:43] what what you're talking with them
[1:00:46] is reflecting the place we are going to
[1:00:50] as simple as that it is reflecting
[1:00:55] now that's why the Bible says let us
[1:00:58] examine ourselves
[1:01:01] so we can see if we are in the face
[1:01:05] have you examined yourself
[1:01:08] are you in the faith
[1:01:10] you examine yourself
[1:01:12] are you going okay if you're not going

[1:01:19] today
[1:01:20] ask God to help you
[1:01:22] so you can be ready to go
[1:01:27] praise the name of the Lord
[1:01:29] and then the king told the prophet or
[1:01:31] the king
[1:01:34] this is even another one God has already
[1:01:36] prepared
[1:01:39] good is amazing when did God prepare him
[1:01:46] did he know that the king would do this
[1:01:49] God knows all things
[1:01:55] the next thing is the next thing
[1:02:00] waiting is for that elected and called
[1:02:03] out Seed of Abraham
[1:02:04] [Music]
[1:02:07] vocabulous
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:11] who was recognized the manifestation of
[1:02:14] God among his people

[1:03:25] my home
[1:03:27] do that fair City
[1:03:31] When the Saints Go March
[1:03:36] and then the prophet told him the king
[1:03:39] God has even prepared
[1:03:45] says that you see these people they did
[1:03:47] not wait and because they didn't wait
[1:03:48] they denominated
[1:04:36] God has given to us
[1:04:53] that he is coming foreign
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:24] [Music]
[1:05:37] okay in in 20 minutes let me let me take
[1:05:39] you through this let us see first Samuel
[1:05:41] chapter 13 verse 14 but now the kingdom
[1:05:44] shall not continue here is when God is
[1:05:46] choosing David now the kingdom shall not
[1:05:49] continue the Lord has sought him and a
[1:05:51] man after his own heart and the Lord has
[1:05:53] commanded him to be Captain over his
[1:05:55] people because thou has not kept that
[1:05:57] which the Lord commanded thee on your
[1:05:58] recommendation
[1:06:10] so here was God choosing David
[1:06:18] foreign
[1:06:47] at this time we're talking about I ask
[1:06:49] you a question where was David
[1:06:56] yes
[1:07:00] yes he was a Shepherd
[1:07:03] somewhere in a bush
[1:07:06] he didn't know what God was planning
[1:07:12] but he was waiting so David really
[1:07:15] started waiting before he even knew the
[1:07:17] plan of God for his life
[1:07:21] brother you may tell me yes I don't know
[1:07:23] what I should wait for what what God
[1:07:25] intends for my life I don't know the
[1:07:27] plan of God just wait my name is
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:35] to be two years from now but wait upon
[1:07:38] the Lord
[1:07:44] David was waiting even when he did not
[1:07:47] know you are in a better place than
[1:07:49] David tonight because I have told you
[1:07:55] David no one told him
[1:07:59] David was just waiting yeah yeah
[1:08:03] way
[1:08:05] way
[1:08:09] [Music]
[1:08:11] upon the Lord
[1:08:16] and
[1:08:17] then came a time when the time of
[1:08:20] waiting was almost over um
[1:08:26] three chapters later
[1:08:29] in 1612.
[1:08:34] and he sent and brought him in now he
[1:08:37] was Rudy and width of a beautiful
[1:08:38] continents and goodly to look too and
[1:08:41] the Lord said arise
[1:08:43] anoint him for this is he then Samuel
[1:08:47] took the Horn of oil and anointed him in
[1:08:49] the midst of his Brethren and the spirit
[1:08:51] of the Lord Came Upon David
[1:08:53] from that day forward so someone rose up
[1:08:56] and went to ramam but the spirit of the
[1:08:58] Lord departed from Saul and an evil
[1:09:00] spirit from the Lord troubled him and
[1:09:02] sold servants said unto him behold now
[1:09:04] an evil spirit from God trouble with
[1:09:06] thee now I want you to see something
[1:09:07] here
[1:09:09] at this time of course we know the story
[1:09:13] how someone went to Jesse's house
[1:09:17] and when he arrived in Jesse's house
[1:09:20] he was supposed to anoint a king there
[1:09:23] yeah
[1:09:24] I want to ask you another question
[1:09:27] did he know who the king was
[1:09:32] he said this the same man that spoke to
[1:09:34] Saul and he said God has chosen another
[1:09:36] man
[1:09:41] so did he eat another man
[1:09:44] he was making my inspiration
[1:09:48] that's why you should always be careful
[1:09:50] when the word of God goes through the
[1:09:52] the minister because sometimes God is
[1:09:54] designing speaking your heart without
[1:09:56] even the money himself knowing what he's
[1:09:58] talking about
[1:10:07] sometimes I may say a few statements
[1:10:09] it's about your life you know it's about
[1:10:11] your life but I don't know anything
[1:10:12] about even what I'm saying
[1:10:19] so yeah Saul was telling King someone
[1:10:22] was telling King Saul
[1:10:25] that God has the kingdom will no longer
[1:10:28] continue with you
[1:10:30] God has chosen himself
[1:10:33] but even so did not know who is
[1:10:36] [Music]
[1:10:41] [Applause]
[1:10:44] and go in the house
[1:10:56] and right there
[1:10:59] he he followed the leadership of God
[1:11:02] it took him there
[1:11:04] what did he have to do friends
[1:11:08] he had to wait
[1:11:10] but like many of us
[1:11:15] sometimes waiting is
[1:11:24] he was anointed
[1:11:27] he was a man of God
[1:11:30] he was inspired
[1:11:34] but what did he have to do at that
[1:11:36] moment
[1:11:41] foreign
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:12:09] Oh e
[1:12:11] r e
[1:12:13] r e e someone was surprised
[1:12:17] but the problem was he never waited he
[1:12:22] saw another one
[1:12:33] and God said no it is
[1:12:44] [Music]
[1:12:50] then again you saw another one
[1:12:53] because
[1:13:10] said to me
[1:13:11] who are those little preachers for
[1:13:13] tomorrow
[1:13:14] send them over here
[1:13:17] all right come come laying up here how
[1:13:19] many times did you just have yes
[1:13:24] huh
[1:13:26] brother some will come come on
[1:13:29] come on and fill the whole place
[1:13:34] just as children
[1:13:38] you see how all of them how good they
[1:13:39] are
[1:13:41] told
[1:13:46] us
[1:13:55] went to the next one
[1:13:59] can you imagine but he didn't wait
[1:14:02] and then all of a sudden
[1:14:05] God had somebody there
[1:14:10] is the name of the Lord
[1:14:12] God had somebody
[1:14:15] that he had kept somewhere
[1:14:18] we are nobody knew
[1:14:23] a
[1:14:25] foreign
[1:14:35] and then he said ah this is Jesus house
[1:14:43] do you have another one he said another
[1:14:46] one the other one is not even I didn't
[1:14:49] even count here
[1:14:51] he is just a rude
[1:15:02] foreign
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:39] foreign
[1:15:45] [Music]
[1:15:54] the man of God was shocked
[1:15:57] but he had no objections
[1:16:02] he had to bring the horn and anointed
[1:16:07] Hallelujah man if the prophet somewhere
[1:16:10] had waited
[1:16:12] he would not have made all these
[1:16:14] spiritual guesses
[1:16:18] we have a lot of prophets today making
[1:16:20] spiritual guesses
[1:16:24] ah
[1:16:26] elujah
[1:16:28] [Music]
[1:16:34] God is
[1:16:45] God is telling me there is someone there
[1:16:48] one woman
[1:16:53] foreign
[1:16:57] [Music]
[1:17:12] then he collects himself
[1:17:20] is the one that has been having
[1:17:22] headaches
[1:17:25] two of them say yeah
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:37] we are not married yet
[1:17:44] you go back I'm telling you
[1:17:49] those spiritual guesses
[1:17:52] why are they mad because men don't wait
[1:17:58] here was a man of God
[1:18:01] a spiritual man of God
[1:18:09] but when
[1:18:11] here
[1:18:24] David that would be God chose him and
[1:18:29] when God chose
[1:18:31] I will not read Because of time God
[1:18:33] anointed him after and the moment God
[1:18:36] anointed him
[1:18:38] the Bible says the spirit of God
[1:18:42] Came Upon David
[1:18:44] and the spirit of God
[1:18:49] and an evil spirit
[1:18:54] how I don't know but that's what the
[1:18:56] Bible says
[1:19:01] Saul was a troubled soul
[1:19:06] but that was for a purpose
[1:19:11] there are certain things that God
[1:19:13] permits to happen
[1:19:15] so that his purpose can be accomplished
[1:19:20] in some people's lives
[1:19:26] Soul had to have this evil spirit
[1:19:29] movie so that David can become relevant
[1:19:32] I wondered
[1:19:34] Hallelujah and when David was anointed
[1:19:39] he still was like a number
[1:19:45] the evil spirit came to sorrow
[1:19:48] and then there was a need
[1:19:51] for somebody who had the spirit
[1:19:55] now the Bible says the spirit of the
[1:19:59] evil spirit
[1:20:00] um
[1:20:08] we know that bad attitude
[1:20:11] that's why I always tell people
[1:20:13] sometimes the people who have bad
[1:20:15] attitude
[1:20:22] [Music]
[1:20:25] it's an evil
[1:20:39] who knows how to play
[1:20:42] Hallelujah who knows how to play music
[1:20:47] Spirit-filled voice
[1:20:52] and I tell you what they looked
[1:20:55] everywhere you know the answer they gave
[1:20:58] him they told him there is one little
[1:21:01] boy
[1:21:04] his name is
[1:21:11] the evil spirit in my soul
[1:21:14] called for the spirit of God in David
[1:21:18] that was not a coincidence
[1:21:22] some people are tormented in this Earth
[1:21:26] so that it can call for what is in you
[1:21:31] to give them a solution
[1:21:35] hallelujah amen let me tell you whenever
[1:21:39] I walk in this world
[1:21:41] I don't know I don't believe it is a
[1:21:43] condition I believe it is how it is
[1:21:45] supposed to be secretary
[1:21:47] I always see myself as a little David
[1:21:50] you should see yourself as a little
[1:21:52] David
[1:21:53] where is
[1:21:56] I can cast it out how are you going to
[1:22:00] cast it out by the spirit of God that is
[1:22:03] in you
[1:22:06] will meet people that are depressed
[1:22:09] you will meet me foreign
[1:22:39] [Music]
[1:23:10] foreign
[1:23:16] and David found himself in the palace
[1:23:19] singing
[1:23:21] singing in moments
[1:23:27] [Music]
[1:23:35] [Music]
[1:23:41] that's a normal voice
[1:23:50] but just a stringed one woman
[1:23:53] and at that moment
[1:24:00] that moment
[1:24:03] there is something in this
[1:24:06] go and tell his father I want this young
[1:24:09] man to be here
[1:24:11] this is his place from today he is going
[1:24:15] to be my amateur again
[1:24:31] because this was
[1:24:34] waiting upon amen
[1:24:40] glory to God
[1:24:43] remember David knew together
[1:24:48] but it didn't boasts
[1:24:56] that he was anointed
[1:25:01] whenever he would sing for songs he will
[1:25:05] see that throne and he will know it is
[1:25:21] Hallelujah
[1:25:48] the anointing
[1:25:50] I wonder which song do you think he sang
[1:25:53] during that moment
[1:26:15] [Applause]
[1:26:22] is taking back
[1:26:25] Linda
[1:27:06] all the anointing all the singers
[1:27:13] foreign
[1:28:15] [Music]
[1:28:24] thank you foreign
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:29:03] things began to go up and down
[1:29:07] vibrations of the power of the Holy
[1:29:10] Spirit
[1:29:12] then he just it was just filled with
[1:29:15] that anointing
[1:29:17] and he asked the question
[1:29:21] who is this uncircumcised the
[1:29:24] Philistines
[1:29:26] that can defy the kingdoms the armies of

[1:31:29] with only one thing Jesus yes only one
[1:31:33] thing the revealed one of the earth
[1:31:40] and when he went again he killed that
[1:31:43] man but let me tell you one thing I
[1:31:45] didn't tell you
[1:31:47] David said
[1:31:51] they asked the question the first
[1:31:53] question the very first question they
[1:31:54] asked is
[1:31:56] the man who will kill this guy
[1:32:00] what will he get but then
[1:32:05] and they told him
[1:32:09] the key is going to give him
[1:32:10] one of his daughters
[1:32:13] foreign
[1:32:42] foreign
[1:33:17] [Music]
[1:33:39] Linda
[1:33:51] throughout the whole time David waited
[1:33:54] David feeding ship he was waiting
[1:33:58] David killing the bear and the lion he
[1:34:01] was away
[1:34:03] when he was anointed
[1:34:07] David when he received favor before the
[1:34:09] king and the kingdom
[1:34:12] now it is
[1:34:18] Goliath and he became the champion
[1:34:22] tell me what did he do he was one
[1:35:00] let me kill him
[1:35:03] he was tempted but he didn't kill him
[1:35:07] what did he do she waited yeah
[1:35:11] for God this time
[1:35:15] David waited and waited and waited
[1:35:21] to the moment
[1:35:24] when Jonathan and Saul were killed in
[1:35:28] battle you understand
[1:35:32] foreign
[1:36:10] to be around some a man or a woman of
[1:36:12] God who is waiting
[1:36:15] to be around such people
[1:36:19] you have to be very careful
[1:36:21] you can lose your life
[1:36:45] you will not be blessed
[1:36:48] took David nearly 15 years
[1:36:54] from the time he was anointed
[1:36:58] some of you here are going to be
[1:37:01] millionaires
[1:37:07] each step of the way
[1:37:12] some of you are going to get married
[1:37:15] you have to wait
[1:37:19] you don't have to rush don't rush things
[1:37:24] go through you want to just get it
[1:37:25] immediately
[1:37:28] people want to be rich overnight
[1:37:31] you can't do that
[1:37:35] because God has has given you a secret
[1:37:39] that you are going to be a pastor
[1:37:42] if God revealed one of you Brothers here
[1:37:45] that you are going to be the next pastor
[1:37:47] of this church
[1:37:54] what are you going to do
[1:37:57] will I even sleep
[1:38:02] instrumentality to it the worry that
[1:38:07] you thought you pull here you pull that
[1:38:09] you push here
[1:38:11] let God do things
[1:38:16] from the time David was anointed
[1:38:19] you did not influence anything big or
[1:38:23] small for him to sit on that throne
[1:38:34] God did everything
[1:38:37] God literally dragged him on that Throne
[1:38:39] is
[1:38:43] [Music]
[1:38:51] that's not how it is
[1:39:00] you say I must get a job
[1:39:03] he must be
[1:39:08] um
[1:39:13] all that is good it's called job hunting
[1:39:18] it's not job hunting that gives you a
[1:39:20] job
[1:39:25] it is faith
[1:39:29] and walking into the dogs
[1:39:32] and walking into the door that God is
[1:39:42] David did not push
[1:39:47] go on your knees
[1:39:51] ask God for leadership
[1:40:06] oh where is it
[1:40:09] gave a testament the other times
[1:40:19] and he got up I don't know what I said
[1:40:23] Hallelujah
[1:40:25] and then finally it was projector light
[1:40:29] project
[1:40:33] the first time it might have been the
[1:40:35] second time it might not have been
[1:40:36] happening
[1:40:38] but what am I saying teaching number
[1:40:40] when even when you come at the altar
[1:40:42] don't rush to go back
[1:40:45] wait on God remember in the convention
[1:40:49] we had some people here
[1:40:51] almost by the way in every service we
[1:40:54] had someone receive the power of God
[1:41:01] foreign and and one one young lady were
[1:41:04] worshiping and she was just all over she
[1:41:06] was just rolling on the floor
[1:41:10] and some people wanted to carry her out
[1:41:12] I didn't even I didn't I was not aware
[1:41:15] of what was happening but the spirit of
[1:41:17] God just carried me I found myself
[1:41:24] it was by inspiration
[1:41:27] and that sister I thought that I think
[1:41:30] they thought she was going to confuse
[1:41:32] everything
[1:41:34] but she did not
[1:41:36] she was waiting in that atmosphere
[1:41:40] and that's the right thing to do it
[1:41:43] someone you feel like crying to the Lord
[1:41:46] and you don't even wait for an article
[1:41:48] to be called you just come on the Altar
[1:41:50] and bro
[1:41:54] you pray wait on God you see you come
[1:41:59] before the service begins
[1:42:03] [Music]
[1:42:10] is actually more and takes longer time
[1:42:13] than actually the real thing
[1:42:19] and when you wait you can never be
[1:42:22] disappointed
[1:42:25] God bless you sir
