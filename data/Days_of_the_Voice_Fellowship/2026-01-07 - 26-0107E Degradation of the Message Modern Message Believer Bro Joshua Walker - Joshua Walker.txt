Use him, Father. Let him say words that he even never thought about. And Lord, may you also direct the thoughts of the people as they receive from you tonight.

So of course we caught up a little bit today because you know we were trying to do some little um rehearsals and meetings with the musicians. And uh I'm happy to see brother brother Enoch here. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so uh brother Josh is a friend. &gt;&gt; And uh you know when I was in Australia I I stayed for the most part I stayed when I was in Brisbane I sat at his house. Brisbane. &gt;&gt; We know his his father-in-law very well here. Brother Gary Walker. Gary Walker. &gt;&gt; They have the last name, but he's not his son. He's his son-in-law. Yes. And so he and Sister Anna are just a wonderful couple and a wonderful children that they have and family. I'm expecting to hear from the Lord today. Amen. So just open your heart. And when God speaks to you, just say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so, uh, brother, if you can just I'm trying to wait for you to make this microphone better before I I hand it over to brother Josh. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, of course, brother M brother Josh is the first one to arrive tonight &gt;&gt; and he arrived yesterday and, uh, so, Brother Michael is arriving tonight. So I may step away during or shortly after the preacher takes on so that I can go pick him up but uh if I go brother Josh I'm following everything I'm just going to be enjoying and so uh how many are under expectation. Amen. Let us sing Amazing Grace as our brother comes. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that save like me. I once was loose but now I'm found. [singing] Was blind but now I see. [music] So I've told brother Josh to just take his liberty preach like he preaches when he's at home and being that we are late. I know these brothers are not long long preachers like us. So just relax. Don't be in a hurry. I know he will not be too long but that is not mean to say build short. Yeah. just take your liberty and you know [music] uh hang on to every word he's saying. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Of course, he doesn't preach like I preach. Every preacher is special. Every man of God is different. And so I want you to be expecting the Lord will [music] speak to your heart. It was grace that &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; my heart to please my [singing] face. [music] How great that grace [singing and music] I give the [singing] I bow our heads in a word of prayer Lord Jesus Jesus. &gt;&gt; Lord, where would we be without your grace? Lord, it's your grace that has brought us through this life. It's your grace that has given us this message, oh God. Lord, and it's your grace that's going to take us back to earth. So Lord God, as we're gathered here in your presence, we ask Lord once more, come and speak to us in a special way, oh Lord God. Lord, you see the nerves, you see the you see the needs, you see everything, oh God, and I pray. May you come, oh God, and speak to us. &gt;&gt; We commit ourselves into your hands in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] God bless you. Nice to be here for the first time in Africa. Everything is new. Everything is exciting. It's all a bit unknown. Um, I'll say I'm out of my comfort zone, but it is a privilege to be here. &gt;&gt; We had brother Bazabosi in Australia. It was a it was a great thrill. Was we had a good time. &gt;&gt; So I bring greetings from the saints in Australia, &gt;&gt; from my father-in-law, &gt;&gt; brother Gary, &gt;&gt; brother Tim with him. Bring greetings from everybody back home. &gt;&gt; Uh as as brother Buzz said, I am married to brother Gary's daughter Hannah. We have three children. I grew up in the message. I'm a I'm a message child, shall I say. I have a testimony of the of God's grace, of God's keeping power, that though the world was there with its allure where Satan wanted to drag me into the world, but it was God's grace that kept me. And even though I was born in the message, I still had to meet him. Still had to meet Christ. &gt;&gt; So we thank God for his power to I'm not real used to speaking with a translator. If I speak if I speak a bit fast, just stop &gt;&gt; and God will help us through. If we could turn in our Bibles to the book of Romans. &gt;&gt; Book of Romans chapter 1 verse 18. &gt;&gt; I would like to speak on the degradation of the message. Degradation of the message. Or another title the Lord has put on my heart is the modern message believer. So we can read Romans chapter 1 verse 18. And it says, "For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness. Because that which may be known of God is manifest in them. For God has showed it unto them. For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and godhead, so that they are without excuse. Because that when they knew God, they g they they glorified him, not as God, neither were thankful, but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened. professing themselves to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and for-footed beasts, and creeping things. Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanliness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves. who changed the truth of God into a lie and worshiped and served the creature more than the creator. Blessed forever. Amen. Amen. So let's turn also one verse in Proverbs chapter 4. Proverbs 20 uh Proverbs 4 verse 23. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4:23. And it says, "Keep thy heart with all diligence, for out of it are the issues of life." Um, &gt;&gt; Proverbs 4 &gt;&gt; 4:23 Scripture says, "Keep your heart because out of it spring the issues of life." There's another translation and above all else guard your heart for everything you do flows from it. May the Lord bless the reading of his word. You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; That word degradation, degradation of the message. That word degradation, it means the process in which beauty and the quality of something is destroyed. The quality is destroyed. It's spoiled. The process by which something is made worse. The message, we've been given the message, but Satan wants to make it worse. There's a spiritual, as we look around us, around the world, There's a spiritual and a moral decline in the earth natural society in America. You can see it. They're rejecting God. They're rejecting the word of God. But all the while claiming that he is God. As we look around us, there's problems with the youth. There's divorce problems. The morals of the world are degrading. They're going down. It's getting worse. When I was growing up in the message, we pretty much are never heard about anybody getting divorced. But now in Australia, in Europe, in America, I don't know what it's like in Africa. But people in the message are now getting divorced and remarried. All the while confessing we're in the message. There's because the issue is life has become so easy in Australia. Life has become so easy. We call it the curse of easy living. We don't need faith for our next meal. We have what we need. Life has become so easy. That God is not required anymore. I have it all. I don't need God. That is the culture that is coming into to the west. &gt;&gt; And you can see how the message was in the 1960s and what the message has become in 2026 in the Ephesian church age. Brother Brandham says in the church age book, HE SAYS, "GOD being a savior, it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself a reason and a purpose of being." So can I say that when I needed salvation I became God's purpose because I needed salvation. GOD BECAME A SAVIOR. BUT BECAUSE GOD HAD A savior locked up inside. God required sin for the the savior to come out of him. God required somebody lost before he could be a savior. That is God's purpose. BUT CAN I SAY SATAN ALSO HAS A PURPOSE. SATAN WANTS TO GET IN THE WAY OF EVERY MOVE OF GOD. SATAN WANTS TO HINDER GOD'S PLAN. And I have news this evening. Satan is only bringing about those things necessary to to commit to God's plan. Hallelujah. SATAN IS SATAN IS helping God's plan. When you look at the Garden of Eden, it was perfect. IT WAS PERFECT. NO SIN. IT WAS PERFECT. BUT GOD COULDN'T DISPLAY WHO HE WAS IN PERFECTION. God required the sin to show who he was. God God HAD ATTRIBUTES LOCKED UP IN HIM. So God allowed SATAN through the serpent to bring sin into the garden so that God could show his attributes. God needed SICKNESS to show I'm a healer. GOD NEEDED PEOPLE IN CHAOS TO SHOW his attributes. My life CAN BE CHAOS. SOMETIMES MY LIFE CAN BE CHAOS. But through the chaos, GOD IS SHOWING HIS ATTRIBUTES IN MY LIFE. CAN I SAY God didn't have sin in him? &gt;&gt; So he allowed the serpent to bring the sin to show who he was. GOD GOD NEVER LOST CONTROL. He just allowed ANOTHER POWER TO TAKE CONTROL to show WHO HE WAS. SO COULD YOU IMAGINE? I don't know how what time period it was. It could have been 100 years, a thousand years. But little by little, Satan through the serpent came to Eve. I don't believe it was an overnight thing. By little by little, the serpent coming to Eve, Eve, you are in the message. Eve, you are a part of Adam. Eve, you are in THE MESSAGE. YOU CANNOT send your day of grace away. Eve, everything you've BEEN TAUGHT IS CORRECT. LITTLE by little by little, Satan is coming against the bride. &gt;&gt; AND SATAN ISN'T TELLING THE BRIDE that you are not the bride. Satan isn't telling the bride that the mysteries are aren't unveiled. He's not telling the bride the miracles are not real. SATAN ISN'T telling the bride that brother Brham is the prophet. Satan's telling the bride, "Brother Brandham's the prophet." You say like that. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't want the bride to denounce the prophet. Just trying to get a compromise on the word that the prophet sent. SATAN SATAN CAN'T TELL ME THAT Malachi 4 isn't completed. But he can come little by little and tell me and tell me that some of the things aren't so important. The mysteries are unveiled. AMEN. SATAN WILL TELL YOU THE MYSTERIES ARE UNVEILED. SATAN WILL TELL YOU THAT BROTHER Brandham was Malachi 4. But he will come and he WILL TELL YOU THAT YOUR PHONE IT CAN'T HURT YOU. Satan will come and he will TELL YOU THAT YOU CAN GO AND look at that thing in the world. It will not hurt you. SATAN WILL SAY JUST CLICK ON THAT VIDEO. IT WILL NOT HURT YOU. BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS THE PROPHET. AMEN. BUT little by LITTLE BY LITTLE, SATAN WANTS TO DILUTE, water it down. He wants to water DOWN THE THINGS THAT we hold dear to OUR HEARTS. AND SO YOU can see in the message, LITTLE BY LITTLE, THE THINGS THAT separate a message church from a denomination ARE BEING DRAGGED OUT OF THE MESSAGE CHURCH. WHAT IS IT? SATAN WANTS TO TAKE THE LIFE OUT OF THE WORD. Satan is LOOKING AT THE WORD. AND SAYING THOSE THINGS DON'T REALLY MATTER AS MUCH AS YOU THINK THEY MATTER. He will say, "Yes, God sent a prophet, but some of the things don't matter as much as you think, little by little, LITTLE BY LITTLE. IT'S NOT OVERNIGHT. SATAN HAS TIME ON HIS HANDS. WE CAME to the message with the right motive, the right object. &gt;&gt; But little BY LITTLE, SATAN says you can wear the shorts IN THE WORLD. YOU CAN CUT YOUR FRINGE. YOU CAN CUT YOUR HAIR. YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT BECAUSE WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE. BECAUSE WE HAVE THE TRUTH, YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT FROM MONDAY TO FRIDAY. BUT AS LONG AS YOU LIVE A GOOD LIFE ON SUNDAY, HALLELUJAH. We're in the message. And Satan says you're secure. You're the bride. Amen. That's the truth. WE BELIEVE THESE THINGS, but little by LITTLE THERE'S A COMPROMISE CREEPING INTO THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; Some of the things that were blatantly wrong in the 1960s and 1950s, they're now acceptable in the message. So I wonder, [clears throat] has the standard changed then? Do these things not matter anymore then? Or is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever? So what's going on? The bars, as brother Brandon would say, the bars are being let down. sin creeps in. &gt;&gt; So I wonder, are the things that are coming into our life making us stronger Christians or weaker Christians? Are the things coming in making us closer to a rapture or is it pushing us further away from a rapture? And brother Brandham would say, "The ministers, the ministers are bending under the load. &gt;&gt; They're bending under the PRESSURE and they're conforming. They're conforming to an opinion rather than what the word says. We should be a spiritled church. We don't need something new. &gt;&gt; WE JUST NEED THE TOKEN, &gt;&gt; THE NEW BIRTH TO COME AND INSPIRE WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. We don't need WE DON'T NEED TO TWIST THE MESSAGE TO MATCH OUR OPINION. WE JUST NEED GOD TO COME AND INSPIRE THE MESSAGE TO CHANGE OUR OPINION TO MATCH UP WITH WHAT GOD SAID. &gt;&gt; There's no point having the great revelations that are unveiled to us if we don't have the life to back up the word. We could have the greatest preaching the world has ever seen, but if the life isn't behind the word, there's something wrong. We pray and pray that God revives our heart. But brother Brandham would say, &gt;&gt; he says, "You watch the morals after a revival to see where that revival come from." So, Brother Brandham would say in the sermon, "A reaction to an action." He says, "Well, we don't want to be modern." I think that's slide five, brother. We don't want to be modern. WE WANT TO BE CHRISTIANS. WE DON'T WANT TO BE MODERN. We want to be Christian. It's not the modernistic trend that we're trying to keep up with. It's going to back to the old hewing lines of God's word as Christians and living like men and women were supposed to live by the order. by the order of Almighty God. So, we can see clearly by the word of God what age we're living in. We can see that we have the highest revelation of any previous age. We can see that we're in the capstone age. We can see that seven church ages HAVE COME TO THIS TIME, TO THIS DATE. BUT AS THE WORD gets higher and higher and higher, you can look around the world and see the morals are lower than they were in John Wesley's time. THE MORALS, THE MORALS, the morals are lower than they were in Luther's time. AND I wonder the things that were not allowed back there, they're now allowed now. &gt;&gt; So can I say that the degradation of the message, the beauty of the message has been watered down? The standard of the message has watered down. So what is the issue? Does the standard not matter anymore? Or has Satan got into the message to hybridize the seed? We never want to be a modern Christian. We don't want to modernize the message to fit 2026. Let my life change to line up WITH THE WORD. I NEVER WANT TO I don't want to change the word to line up with my life. It is our responsibility. IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY AS MESSAGE believers to line up with the word. I don't want to adapt and change and twist a quote TO MATCH MY LIFE. SO EITHER EITHER there's two options. Either the message was wrong in 1960 or something is wrong now. So I have an option. Do I pick and choose the quotes that I like or do I change me to line up with all of it? Do I say, "Lord, this is my opinion. I like my opinion." Sometimes we think we're quite clever with our opinions and we say, "Lord, I I have my opinion. I have my way ABOUT CHRISTIANITY." GOD IS LOOKING FOR AN individual that can lay aside their opinion. &gt;&gt; No matter no matter how good that opinion could be because the message IS JESUS CHRIST THE same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Cuz when I read the Bible, IT SAYS, "I AM THE LORD. I CHANGE NOT. SO THE STANDARD, the message preached back there is just as re relevant today as it was back there. So God is looking for a person that can have all of the revelation with a life to back up the revelation. Because brother Brandon would say, "I have a ministry to declare that he is here." How is he here? He's in your life. You have the revelation of the word, but he WANTS TO COME AND BACK UP THE REVELATION. GOD WANTS TO BE REAL IN YOU. I'M TALKING ABOUT A RAPTURE caliber person. I'M TALKING ABOUT A BRIDE CALIBER PERSON. I want to be rapture ready on that day. THE RAPTURE COULD BE TOMORROW. SO, LET ME CHANGE MY LIFE TO MATCH UP WITH THE WORD. Brother Brandham would say, &gt;&gt; he says, "If there's the world inside of you, you must die to that world." And there Satan comes to Eve and says, "Eve, YOU WON'T DIE." AND EVE has the right answer. Eve said, "But he said, if we eat of this fruit, we will die. And then Satan says, "Surely, surely you won't die." But you'll be wise like God. That sounds pretty good, eh? They all had a desire to be like God. And Satan came to their human ability and poked and poked AND POKED. IS BEAUTIFUL. Sin is enticing. If there's someone sitting here and says sin is not enticing, you are lying. Sin is beautiful. Sin glows. BUT THERE IS A POWER INSIDE OF THE BRIDE TO RESIST THE TEMPTATION OF SIN. I'M TALKING ABOUT A PERSON WITH A REVELATION WHO THEY ARE. And Satan would say to Eve, "You'll be okay. Just go wherever your heart chooses to go. Just go where it feels good." And there's a saying in Australia. I don't know if you say it here. &gt;&gt; The young people would say the vibe felt right. Do you say that here? &gt;&gt; V I E the felt good to go wherever I felt TO GO. BUT THERE is death in going where it feels right. There is death in going where the vibe feels right. And then God said we would surely die if we go back into the word. As I read in Romans 1, you've been given the word. Don't turn back on the word. And Satan would say, "Eve, SURELY YOU WON'T DIE. GOD IS LOVE, GOD of acceptance." &gt;&gt; And then Brother Brandon would say, "No, he's a God of judgment." And then they would say, "Well, let's just let any sort of music come into the church. Let's just change OUR WAY OF WORSHIP. LET US GO WHERE IT feels right. MY LITTLE music that was wrong in 1950, in 1960 is now okay in the message. And they would say, "Can you not feel the atmosphere? &gt;&gt; Can [snorts] you not feel that shiver run down your spine? Satan has the ability to create an ATMOSPHERE through that music. Satan can come on that music. Satan can pump up an atmosphere. Never go off emotion. Never go off emotion. THE ATMOSPHERE MIGHT FEEL REAL GOOD. BUT WHAT DOES THE WORD SAY? LET me change my opinion to what the word say. The whole purpose of a song service is so that your heart can be opened up to receive the word that is coming. The atmosphere in the music is wrong. What is your heart being opened up to receive? So you can see in the message things aren't just said to fill a few pages. There is a purpose to the things that are in the message. Don't go with emotion. Stay with the word of God because heavens and earth will pass away. MY WORD will never pass away. Let me in the right atmosphere. Open my heart to receive the word. I'm talking about the bride receiving the SEED OF CHRIST. THE SEED of Christ is what will take you from this world to another world. The bride has the seed of Christ. Satan wants to intermingle his seed with God's word. And that's what brother Brandham would call hybridization. You can read quote after quote on hybridization. You can read why it's wrong. Why is it wrong? Is because now the seed doesn't have the ability to reproduce anymore. The message, the message of the hour, the whole purpose of the message is to REPRODUCE CHRIST. SO IF SATAN CAN WATER DOWN THE WORD, the message cannot fulfill its purpose. GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LIFE. GOD IS LOOKING FOR A PERSON HERE WHO CAN SAY I'M CHANGING MY opinion so that THE WORD CAN BE COMPLETED IN MY LIFE AND GOD IS GOING THROUGH THE EARTH SAYING GIVE ME A LIFE. I'M LOOKING FOR A VESSEL THAT CAN CHANGE AND SAY, "LORD, NOT MY WILL. LET MY WILL BE DONE. You may never feel a thing." Like Mary, SHE NEVER FELT a an emotion, but the word was being formed in her way. When did the persecution start for Mary? It's when the word WAS DISPLAYED. SOMETHING IS CHANGING IN THE WORD. Mary had her own opinion. HOW CAN THESE THINGS BE SAID, "BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO your word." GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR OPINION. GOD DOES NOT REQUIRE OUR INTERPRETATION. HE REQUIRES FAITH IN THE WORD HE HAS SPOKEN. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS LOOKING FOR A VESSEL THAT CAN SAY YES LORD &gt;&gt; BE UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WILL. Satan comes and he says these things DO NOT MATTER. HE'S taking the life out of the word. &gt;&gt; Did you know you can read this, but if it's not mingled with life, this has no effect. who requires a lot. I'm so thankful that we had a prophet in this hour. Now, we preach a sermon like anointed ones at the end times. Just because they're speaking in tongues, interpretations doesn't mean God is behind it. I'm thankful that we are not ignorant TO SATAN'S TACTICS. SATAN CAN come and impersonate every gift. Brother Brandon was saying, &gt;&gt; BUT HE CANNOT IMPERSONATE THE LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST. AND THAT IS WHY SATAN WANTS TO TELL each and EVERYONE that you have the word but some things ARE NOT IMPORTANT. HE WANTS TO put his own opinion into God's word. He wants to put his own opinion into what God has said. UNLESS YOU STOP AND SAY THAT MIGHT BE RIGHT. The life that you have no longer has the ability to reproduce. The whole purpose of the message is to put God back into his children into the church again. Just because there's an atmosphere, an emotion doesn't mean God IS BEHIND YOU. IT MUST LINE UP WITH the words. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandon would say, he says, "STUDY THE ENEMY'S TACTICS. KNOW HIS WAYS. Know his method." SATAN WANTS TO HYBRIDIZE GOD'S SCENE AND BRING DEATH TO THE BODY. Satan wants to get back to the GARDEN OF EDEN. HE'S TRYING TO GET BACK. He's saying, "If I can attach myself to you, I CAN GO BACK." GOD IS looking for A VESSEL, NOT ME. &gt;&gt; Stand with the word of God regardless if IT COST ME FAMILY, FRIENDS, WHETHER MY CHURCH kicks me out, I will stand with the word. Satan is trying to get us to eat of THAT TREE ONCE AGAIN. SO SATAN, Satan comes, he says, "Eve, you can't die. YOU COME FROM ADAM. I'm as eternal." Brother Brandham said, "As God is." Brother Brandham said, "I'm as eternal as God is." The bride is eternal. &gt;&gt; So Satan comes and he says, "You're eternal. YOU'RE SECURED. LOOK WHERE YOU COME FROM. The most dangerous place for a message believer is to feel secured because we're in the message. The greatest lie that Satan has in 2026 is to say because you go to a message church, YOU'RE SAVED. IF YOU'RE SITTING HERE feeling secured tonight because you're in a message church, SATAN'S GOT YOU. Never feel secured because God sent a prophet. You can only feel secured when that LIFE OF JESUS CHRIST IS INSIDE OF YOU. SAY you born again. It's a false confidence to feel I'm secured. God sent a prophet. For 50 years, people have believed I'm saved. God sent a prophet. for 50 years because God sent a prophet. It goes far beyond God sent a prophet. It goes way beyond. Let me catch the reason why God sent a PROPHET change to match up with what the prophet. So many times we worry, we stress, we try so hard. Brother Brandon would say, "Just live a clean Christian life and the rest will take care of you." So we can see, brother Brandon would tell us in the church age book, he says, "It's not an apple that Eve ate." We know that. WE SAY, "AMEN. HE SAYS, HE SAYS IT WAS THE degradation of humanity, the watering down of humanity, &gt;&gt; intermingling the seed. Eve was THE SEED OF ADAM, SEED OF GOD. But as soon as Satan's life was in the in THE WOMB OF MARY, NOW THE SEED of God was degraded. Now that seed couldn't reproduce Christ. But I'm so thankful that since that time, God little by little BY LITTLE HAS SAID, "I'M TAKING YOU BACK TO THE GARDEN." And now there's an Eve on the FACE OF THE EARTH. AND BROTHER Brandon would say there's A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT EVE and this Eve. This Eve has already taken on the seed of God. AND GOD IN THIS AGE HAS POURED OUT HIS brother Brandon WOULD SAY THE BRIDE STANDS PREGNANTATED BY THE WORD OF GOD. SO can I SAY YOUR WOMB IS CLOSED? You have no room for Satan. And brother Brandon would SAY YOUR YOUR HEART IS THE WOMB. YOUR HEART IS THE WOMB. HE says you believe the word, you've taken on THE SEED OF GOD. HE SAYS, "YOU believe the word, the blood is applied, and now life is on the way." Isn't that an amazing thing to think the womb is sealed, BROTHER? So when Satan comes and says, "You're not the bride." You can look at him and say, "WHY EVEN BOTHER? I HAD THE MOST AMAZING thing happened to me the other morning. I just woke up and this this temptation, this thought just come into my mind and straight away I laughed. I said, "Satan, why bother? I can't disbelieve even if I wanted to. I couldn't even walk away if I wanted to. And can I say there's been times in my life where I'VE SAID, "LORD, I GIVE UP. LORD, I'VE HAD ENOUGH. I'm walking away. God's grace has already sealed the womb." AND GOD SAID, "YOU'RE MY SON. YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER. &gt;&gt; YOU COULDN'T WALK AWAY. NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO, &gt;&gt; THERE'S SOMETHING THAT WILL HAUNT YOU. CHASE YOU UNTIL YOU SAY, "LORD, I GIVE UP. LORD, I'M COMING BACK HOME." HALLELUJAH. ASK THE LORD FOR GRACE. I thank God for grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We thank the Lord for grace. &gt;&gt; So can I say you can't take on serpent SEAT womb is closed. So when SATAN SAYS WHY DON'T YOU JUST COMPROMISE A LITTLE BIT there's something PULSATING SOMETHING ALIVE AND IT SAYS OH NO NO there's no hybrid I SEE as for me in my house we will serve the Lord and it's amazing it'sing Amazing when you look in the message and you see that one word broken by Eve caused all this chaos around. So now it's all of the word required to take us back TO [clears throat] all of the word. So now can I say you have become the word. ALL OF THE WORD. EVERY SINGLE BRIDE MEMBER makes up the word. There's no hybridized seed in her. SO WHEN YOU look through the message through the Bible, God has always hated the hybridization. God would tell the Israelites, "Don't marry THE CANAANITES. I'M protecting my seed. Don't marry the Moabites. I'M PROTECTING MY SEED." Jesus is coming DOWN THE LINE. DON'T INTERMINGLE THE SEED. JESUS IS COMING DOWN THE LINE. &gt;&gt; And even in the Bible, he would say if the children of the hybridized seed, they cannot enter the assembly of God for 10 generations. God hates hybridization. Satan loves harmonization. So Satan can get a church to compromise. Satan can get a pastor to compromise. If Satan can get ONE MEMBER OF A CHURCH TO COMPROMISE, life is taken out of the church for Christ TO BE REPRODUCED. BE LIFE. &gt;&gt; And so many times, brother Brandon would talk about pastors, churches compromising for the meal ticket. But let us be a people who stand regardless of WHAT IT COSTS. THE MESSAGE should come with liberty. Stand firm in the liberty and be not entangled again with the YOKE OF BONDAGE. IF WE SAY I'm a message BELIEVER with a liberty, being a message believer doesn't come with a burden of self-care. Or should I say a burden of self-control. I live this way because I want to LIVE THIS WAY. AS BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, HE SAYS, "I like to do that, but my religion won't let me do it. I shouldn't do it." He says, &gt;&gt; he says, "That's the most miserable person I CAN THINK OF." HE SAYS, "IF THAT'S ALL WE'VE GOT, WE OUGHT TO BURY IT. GET YOUR SHOVEL AND PUT IT IN IT. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF THERE'S LIFE THERE, there should be emotion. I'M NOT TEACHING THAT YOU SHOULD SHOUT, YOU SHOULD JUMP, BUT THERE SHOULD BE SOMETHING PULSATING IN THE LIFE OF THE BELIEVER. BEING being a message believer being a message believer comes with a responsibility. Don't say I'm a message believer if you don't want the responsibility. We must conduct oursel in obedience TO THE WORD. IF friends cast you aside because of your Christianity, &gt;&gt; because you wouldn't change your way to a modern Christian, a modern a modern message believer. I don't want no hybridization. I'll stay with UNADULTERATED GENUINE PURE SON OF GOD. There's no life in compromising. There's no life in hybridization. When you look at Jesus' LIFE, HE was rejected because he said, "When you see me, you see the father. Now the bride says, "When you see me, you see Christ." Hallelujah. You will be rejected. You're rejected because you wouldn't go to the dance. You're rejected because you wouldn't take a little social drink. The bride doesn't drink. The bride doesn't compromise. The bride doesn't GO TO THE DANCE. &gt;&gt; THE BRIDE SAYS, "WHEN YOU SEE ME, YOU SEE CHRIST." HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say, he says, "You can't get pure and bitter water out of the same spring." The bride is rejected because they wouldn't wear the earrings, the makeup, is rejected for looking like a Christian. Jesus was rejected. &gt;&gt; Let's not walk through life thinking we've got it easy. We've got friends as soon as there's a separation. You will be rejected for standing on Christ's word. Be confident though. Jesus was rejected. Jesus went through what you go through. Sometimes we place Jesus above rejection. SOMETIMES WE PLACE JESUS ABOVE BEING TEMPTED. JESUS WAS TEMPTED IN ALL THINGS. &gt;&gt; Jesus never compromised. COULD YOU IMAGINE WHEN JESUS DISCIPLES left him in the garden? &gt;&gt; Could you imagine when the 70 left him for saying drink my blood? Jesus never tried to explain himself. He said this is my word. Could you imagine the hurt Jesus felt, &gt;&gt; THE EMOTION JESUS FELT? WHEN PETER DENIED HIM that could you imagine just picture in your MIND NOW Jesus looked at Peter there's Peter sitting over by the campfire AND HE SAYS I NEVER WALKED WITH JESUS swore he said I never knew Imagine the pain in Jesus' eyes and he CATCHES PETER'S EYE might have been tears is rolling DOWN JESUS' FEET. HE WAS REJECTED FOR BEING THE WORD. YOU WILL BE REJECTED FOR BEING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; And sometimes we read the stories about Jesus. We think Jesus was easy for Jesus because he was Jesus. IT WAS NOT EASY FOR HIM. HE HAD TO DIE TO HIS WILL. &gt;&gt; Jesus won more victory in the garden than he did at Calvary. &gt;&gt; I didn't get it. &gt;&gt; Jesus won more victory in the garden. &gt;&gt; than he did at Calvary. That's what brother Brandham said. Because without the garden, there's no Calvary. And if you don't die to your own will in the garden, you will never go in a rapture. But let the bride say, "Be it unto me according to your word." If churches reject us, let it be for the word's sake. If friends throw me out, let it be for the word's sake. I don't care IF MY FAMILY REJECT ME. Let me stand with the word. LET ME DIE TO MY OWN WILL. SAY, "OH GOD, CHANGE MY OPINION. CHANGE WHO I AM. LET ME BECOME CHRIST." &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in the same That six number six slide please. He says I stand at the door and knock at &gt;&gt; he says I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community. Social standing. Can I say I'd rather be an outcast than to rub my name off the lamb's book of life? &gt;&gt; So, can I ask you? What is your priority? Do you prefer your social standing or your name on the lamb's book of life? Because you can't have both. Those that are Christlike are rejected. Go read the scriptures. Go read Isaiah. Look in the message of the hour. Brother Brandham's friends rejected him because he said, "I will not compromise." &gt;&gt; What if the Pentecostals say, "We give you a Cadillac. We give you a million dollars. Just a few little things though, you need to change that serpent seed doctrine. Just let's just let's GET RID OF THAT. LET'S GET RID OF uh marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; Let's get rid of Let's get rid OF BAPTISM IN THE NAME of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Let's get rid of those things. WE'LL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY. WE'LL GIVE YOU A SOCIAL STANDING. I am thankful I had a prophet that would not. If the prophet had compromised there, all was lost because hybridization was coming into the sea. Search it in. God hates hybridization. But so many times we read stories about Jesus, we think it's easy. JESUS didn't care. They hated him. He was a man with a heavy burden. &gt;&gt; 30 years old, they said, "You look about 50." Comes down to your what Jesus went through. What happens IS YOU SEE YOUR OWN SITUATION. You can see your story, right? It's not a and I should close. In Australia, we say I'm closing. Then 20 minutes, we say I'm closing. Then 20 minutes we say we're closing. But so so many times, so many times we read the scripture and we place Jesus as some far off external deity. OUT THERE. That is what denominations have. God out there. But through the things we go through, we start to pick up what Jesus went through. We start to see Jesus HAD FEELINGS. JESUS HAD PAIN. But when Jesus CAUGHT HIS PURPOSE, HE COULD FACE THE REJECTION KNOWING CALVARY IS MY PURPOSE. THE SCRIPTURE SAID THAT JESUS SET HIS FACE LIKE FLINT to Jerusalem. THE BIBLE STORY MUST COME OUT OF THE word into alive. &gt;&gt; When I went to Sunday school, it was Bible stories. Bible stories. I HAVE BECOME THE BIBLE STORY. NOW I'VE CAUGHT THE REASON BEHIND THE BIBLE STORY. WHEN ALL YOU CAN DO IS JUST CRY YOURSELF TO SLEEP. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'VE EVER BEEN THERE WHEN THERE'S JUST SOMETHING IN YOUR LIFE AND YOU'RE JUST CRYING AND CRYING. THERE'S SOMETHING GOING ON AND YOU'RE BURIED. NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IS THE BIBLE IS BECOMING 3D coming out of the pages. NOW YOU CAN SEE WHEN JESUS WAS REJECTED HE CRIED. WHEN DAVID, remember in the scripture, when David wept over Jerusalem, he's a man rejected. &gt;&gt; But it's Christ in me, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; I I And Jesus, the amazing thing about Jesus, he wouldn't degrade HIS WORTH. HE KNEW who he was. And Jesus wouldn't stoop down to religious leaders. He would NOT DEGRADE HIS WORTH TO KEEP A FRIENDSHIP. MY YOUNG BROTHER, NEVER CHANGE YOUR PERSONALITY TO KEEP a friendship. Stay true to who you are. Let Christ let Christ be seen in me. I never want to be stuck here praying to a God out there. &gt;&gt; I want a prayer to come from God to God. Let me explain that. When Jesus prayed, when Jesus prayed, &gt;&gt; who was praying? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus prayed, who was he praying to? &gt;&gt; And now, brother Brandon would say that he is in you as much as you will let him. Brother Brandon would say, "All that was in God, he poured into Christ." All that was. And that's good. WE CAN BELIEVE THAT. THAT'S easy to believe. Now, WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO YOU, ALL THAT WAS IN CHRIST POURED INTO HIS PRIDE. AND NOW HE'S LOOKING FOR AN INDIVIDUAL SAYS, "It's me. It's me." Remember that story of little Johnny? He saw himself in the mirror. He saw himself in the mirror of the word. So now when you're praying, WHO'S PRAYING? I DON'T WANT TO BE PRAYING to some great external God out there. But when I pray, oh God, MAY IT BE YOU talking through me. Sometimes I don't know what to say. So Lord, look at the light in my heart. That's what the message has done. It's put God back into a human race. Jesus Jesus was the first of a new race of people. Can I say the first, not the end? If he's the first, there must BE COMING MORE. IT'S &gt;&gt; CHRIST Christ in me the glory. &gt;&gt; So that's now when it when it comes down we can read the Bible. We read the stories but when it comes down to YOU when it comes down to your situation that's the great battle. Now when there's pressure to compromise When there's pressure to say, "I can listen to what I want." When there's pressure, when your friend, your cousin says, "But I do it. Why can't you?" There must be a life that says, "I don't want no hybrid. I don't want to hybridize the seed." There is pain in saying no. THERE IS EMOTION with saying no. Let me lay my feelings and opinions aside. BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO YOUR WORD. BE IT UNTO ME. IS THAT YOUR TESTIMONY? IS THAT YOUR WORD? BE IT UNTO ME, OH GOD. Or or do we compromise and degrade the message? Water down. What does degrading do? It takes the effects of the word out of the message. What does hybridization do? It takes the life out of the word. And if the life is taken out, We have church. But what did Jesus say? Did he say, "I've come to give you church and more church and more church." Or did he say, "I've come to give you life. I've come to give you life. I LOVE CHURCH." BUT IF THERE'S NO LIFE in the church, it's a WASTE OF TIME. IF YOU'VE been coming to church for 20 years, but there's no life. You have wasted 20 years. Let us take the pain of rejection. I'M NOT COMPROMISING. I'M NOT HYBRIDIZING. Let us take the pain of that rejection. USING IT TO TRANSFORM INTO POWER FOR TOMORROW. We have a lot of problems. We have a LOT OF REJECTIONS. WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES. NEVER MAKE IT PERSONAL THOUGH. NEVER MAKE THE PROBLEM PERSONAL. THE problem has come so that Christ can be seen. YOU MUST OVERCOME. THE PROPHET WOULD SAY THAT God is not going to pull you through a PIPE and say, "BLESSED IS HE WHO OVERCOMES." HE SAYS, "YOU NEVER OVERCOME." You never overcome nothing. WHEN YOU'RE REJECTED AND YOU TURN TO GOD, YOU'RE OVERCOMING. WHEN YOU'RE REJECTED AND YOU SAY, "I DON'T CARE. LET [screaming] LIFE PULSATE. LET LIFE COME OUT OF ME. LET ME BE THE WORD WAVED OVER THE PEOPLE. LET me see my reaction. It's Christ." &gt;&gt; Or can I put it like this? &gt;&gt; The bride doesn't react. The bride responds. Can I say a reaction is something that happens without a thought. It's a quick reaction. If I put my hand on a stove, I pull it away quick as well. &gt;&gt; It's a reaction. It's quick. And sometimes people the reaction shows what the seed IS instant instant hand off the stove quick reaction. And if someone EROD IF SOMEONE CUTS YOU OFF ON the road your reaction shows the life. Cuz I'm talking about when you haven't had time to get your Bible and read, "How should I respond to the road rage? There's no time to call the PASTOR and say, "Pastor, what should I do? Someone cut me off on the road." The reason in Australia we have lanes and if you cut someone off honk [snorts] swearing out the window. Our roads are a little different. But you see your reaction shows the life. There's no time to formulate. I REACT and my father-in-law, brother Gary, you know, he has this saying. He says, "Road rage is not evangelism." YOUR REACTION SHOWS THE LIFE. I have a desire for the world to see Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you understand my accent. And I find it amazing when you look in the message. &gt;&gt; How brother Brandon would speak so much against Elvis Presley and Pat. &gt;&gt; You don't need to give yourself away, but you go and listen to one of their songs. You listen to Elvis Presley sing Amazing Grace. Amazing Grace. &gt;&gt; That man HAD AN ANOINTING. THAT MAN HAD A VOICE. THAT MAN WAS GIFTED. Brother Brandham said he was gifted. He was sold by gift to Satan. &gt;&gt; So I wonder if he sings Amazing Grace, a nice song, beautiful song. We sing it. Is it okay for me to go and listen to Elvis Presley sing Amazing Grace knowing the anointing behind it? [sighs] Well done. Amen. So, you see, there's an anointing behind it. And I'm not really here to talk about music. I don't have time to talk about music. But you can see there's an anointing behind the music. And brother Brandon would say that Pat Boon. He said Pat Boon should not be permitted to speak the NAME OF JESUS. SO naturally I go and I say who's Pat Boon? I get on Google. I say I listen to one of his songs and I think goodness that is very tame. There's there's compared to the music today is nothing. That's nothing. So I wonder &gt;&gt; what has changed? &gt;&gt; What has changed? Is it the Is it the standard has changed and now it's okay? Or has our opinion changed and gone the way of Satan? I'm not a prophet. I just have to believe what the prophet said. Is now my responsibility to line up with what the prophet said. So now Satan says, "If I can just make you compromise on the word, has anyone ever heard of Randy Travis? He's an American. He's an American country singer. Sings country songs." And this man says, "I don't write Christian songs because I'm a Christian. I'm not a Christian. I write Christian songs because there's money to be made. I wonder what the atmosphere is behind that song and I can listen to the song. It's amazing song. But something is wrong somewhere. There must be a conviction in the heart OF THE BELIEVER. THAT WHEN THAT CHRISTIAN ROCK Pentecostal music starts blaring and I know I'm on the other side of the world, but the word says what the word says. I will not compromise. Let me stay with what the word says. The message says it's wrong. The message says it's not PLEASING UNTO GOD. I HAVE A DEEP, let me tell you something. I have a deep DESIRE to have a God-pleasing life. Hallelujah. I want to GO IN A RAPTURE. I WANT to be the word walking. So if I have to change my opinion to go in a rapture, let me change my opinion to go in a rapture. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; As brother Brandham would say, &gt;&gt; he says the angel of the Lord likes only believe. &gt;&gt; There's an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; So if the song surface is going and going and going then we say let's sing only believe AND THE ATMOSPHERE GOES DOWN THERE'S NO ATMOSPHERE no more. &gt;&gt; Can I say there's something wrong with the atmosphere? There's something wrong with the atmosphere. &gt;&gt; Do we believe these things? Prophet said 60 years ago doesn't matter anymore. It's right or wrong. Let's never hybridize the seed. The angel of the Lord liked that song and then we sing it and suddenly we have no atmosphere. Something is wrong with the atmosphere. Let me say this &gt;&gt; and I hope we take it right. Let's not be affiliated with the message if we don't agree with the message. It's a waste of time. I want to go IN THE RAPTURE. YOU might not shake my hand at the door. Let me GO INTO RAPTURE. You might never want TO SEE ME AGAIN. &gt;&gt; I'LL SHAKE YOUR HAND in heaven. [sighs] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is brother Brandon would say when you look at King Ahab, I should close. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say about Ahab, Ahab, King Ahab, the worst KING ISRAEL EVER. AND I READ THAT AND MY own opinion of course is there. And I say, "Yeah, but King Ahab never sacrificed his own children." Do you know there was kings of Judah that sacrificed his children? King Ahab don't seem so bad. He ain't he ain't killing his children. But that's my opinion. And then I come to find out, brother Brandon would say, "It's not because of the idol worship. It's not because of his wife. It's because he was a borderline believer." This was a man This was a man who said, "I'm in the message. I'M IN THE MESSAGE." BUT WHEN THE message says you should live a certain way, he said, "Yeah, nah. In Australia we say yeah nah. &gt;&gt; He was a makeel believer and he never come into the obedience of the message. He could see that Elijah was a prophet but he never came into obedience. HE CONFESSED GOD SENT A PROPHET AND HE just hung around the message for THE FEELING OF SAFETY. I want and a borderline believer is a person that tells the preacher, he tells the preacher, "DON'T PREACH ON THIS. DON'T PREACH ON THAT. NEVER PREACH ON MUSIC. STAY AWAY FROM THAT. NEVER PREACH ON THIS. PREACH ON SIN." Brother Brandon would say, "The preachers are bending under the pressure. Let us never never bend under the pressure. Don't try and change the message. JUST LINE UP WITH THE MESSAGE. There's plenty OF OTHER CHURCHES THAT DON'T believe the message. There is over a thousand denominations. FROM ONE BIBLE, THOUSAND DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS. We have one message. Let us be the bride. Satan wants to separate into groups. LET US AS PASTORS, AS PREACHERS, PREACH THE WORD, HEAVEN HIGH. Heaven high. say gun barrel straight hell hot. &gt;&gt; I don't want the security of being a message believer. I want the security of being a believer of the word. Not just a believer, but a doer of the word. Let me change my opinion. Let me change my interpretation and say, Lord, I might not AGREE WITH IT. I MIGHT NOT understand it, BUT I WANT SOMETHING MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. I WANT THE LIFE OF CHRIST. AND IF YOU COMPROMISE ON THE WORD, it takes THE LIFE OF CHRIST OUT OF YOU. AND IF YOU WANT TO GO IN THE RAPTURE, Christ's life must be pulsating. I don't I DON'T WANT A SOCIAL RELIGION. I want Jesus Christ. So when the church wants to degrade the music in the message, let me take my opinion to the word. Go and look what he says ABOUT ELVIS PRESLEY. GO AND LOOK WHAT HE SAYS ABOUT PATON. He says this is a He says about Pat Boon. He says this is a man who sings on Sunday and lives like a devil on Monday. We call that a makeeliever. So let me anchor my faith in the word. Let me anchor my because man's opinion shifts. It changes in the 1950s, 1960s. Man had a way of doing worship. Now it's changed and it will continue to change. But the bride must line up with the word of God. Let me read you a quote in questions and answers. Look at slide seven. But he says, "Don't you like them old songs? Don't you like them old songs?" Listen. He says, "I want to say this. If we had more of those old songs instead of so much of this carrying on. I like the way the prophet puts it. So much of this carrying on that we do HAVE because I believe the church would be better off. He says I like those good old songs penned by the Holy Spirit. Let me line up with the word of God. I'm going to close. [laughter] So you see the problem that the reason why God hates denominations is because they've taken the life out of the word. And so the the thing with a denomination is The denomination has a program so worked out. The denomination has a a a entertaining song service that you can you see in the Pentecostal churches they got strobe lights flashing. They got they got music. They sing like you wouldn't believe. I'm from Australia. I don't sing too good. &gt;&gt; I'll just be quiet when you guys sing. &gt;&gt; They have an ability to create an atmosphere with their music, with their lights. With the drum set beating in the corner. There's nothing wrong with a drum set. It's the way the spirit behind the way it's played. There's a spirit attached to it. So you see, you must guard yourself against the spirit. &gt;&gt; So you see, a denomination has the program so worked out. They can create an atmosphere that they don't require God. They have an atmosphere. &gt;&gt; And they can preach a sermon like you wouldn't believe. They put us message preachers to shame sometimes for what they preach. But the issue of it is there's no life behind it. The life the life has been taken out of it. And because the life has been taken out of the denomination, Satan doesn't need to attack the denomination. He's coming to attack the message churches. He's coming against the message churches. And little by little, the denomination started off with a good uh a good incentive, A GOOD OPINION. BUT WHEN the word moved on, they stayed. Now the word is moving on in 2026. Stay with the word you had in 2025. Satan wants to hybridize. Satan, he wants to take the life out, but let the life stay in the message. Never let the word be degraded. NEVER LET THE LIFE BE TAKEN OUT. If your opinion doesn't match with what I'm saying, throw what I'm saying out. GO AND CHECK IT WITH THE WORD. [cheering] Go and check it with the word. So, a denomination has it. so worked out, they don't require God anymore. We can confess WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE. WE CAN CONFESS we've got church order. Let me see a life. Let me see a life backing it up. Let me see a godgiven atmosphere. LET ME SEE A LIFE THAT WHEN THERE'S REJECTION, They don't yell. They don't swear. But they say, "Oh God, forgive them. They don't know what they did." In life story, in the sermon, life story, Brother Brandham says, "I'm not afraid about Russia coming in and whipping us or some other nation coming in and whipping us. He says, "We're whipping ourself by our own morals. It's degrading us. It ain't the robin that pecks on the apple. It ain't the robin that pecks the apple. It's not the bird that eats the apple. It's not the wor It's the worm. It's the worm at the core that kills the apple. It's our own opinion inside that changes the way we look at the world. It's not something out there trying to get you. It's something in the inside trying to get you to change who you are. He says, "And I tell you, brother." He says, "You let a woman get an old taste of salvation and it'll straighten her up." &gt;&gt; Straighten her up. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is in the lady you see in church age, Revelations chapter 3, the scripture says it's the spirit, the spirit talking to the age. And it says, "Thou sayest, I AM INCREASED WITH GOODS. I have need of nothing." What are they saying? We've got the prophet. WE GOT A CHURCH STRUCTURE. We have an entertaining song service. We have an amazing ministry. I don't need nothing. I'm secure with the message. And the spirit answers back. And the spirit's saying, "THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. BUT SAY I SAY thou art wretched, naked, BLIND, AND DON'T KNOW IT. BUT THE MESSAGE HAS COME TO CALL THE bride out of Leia. I heard a voice AND IT SAID, "COME OUT OF HER, MY PEOPLE." DID YOU ever see HE CALLED YOU MY PEOPLE? YOU HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE. LAY ASIDE YOUR OPINION. YOU HAVE BEEN BOUGHT WITH A PRICE. YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY. RAISE THE STANDARD OF THE WORD. AND SAY THE CHURCH WORLD IS GOING THAT WAY. THE WORD SAYS GO THAT WAY. I'M GOING THIS WAY. THOUGH IT HURTS, THOUGH FRIENDS REJECT ME. THOUGH THE CHURCHES REJECT ME, I WILL STAND WITH CHRIST. CHRIST IS LOOKING FOR SOMEBODY. THEY WILL SAY, "I'M NOT HYBRIDIZING. GIVE ME LIFE. GIVE ME LIFE IN ABUNDANCE. BE IT UNTO ME ACCORDING TO ME. Let's stand to our feet. Let's stand to our feet. It doesn't matter what our opinion says. IT DOESN'T MATTER. REGARDLESS OF the evidence, Joshua and Caleb, REGARDLESS OF THE EVIDENCE, WE CAN TAKE the land. Regardless what THE ME WHAT EVERYONE SAYS, WHAT THE MESSAGE says on raising our families, it still matters. What the message says on how we should TREAT ONE ANOTHER. STILL MATTERS. &gt;&gt; Churches and brother Brandon would say, "I drew the circle wider." THEY STEPPED OUT. I DREW it wider. Let me let me let me lay aside my opinion and draw the circle wider. By this shall all men know you are my disciples. And you have love one for another. I'm not talking about a filio natural love. I'm talking about an agape love that loves when there can't be love that is proven on a cross. THIS IS THE LOVE THAT GOD REQUIRES. AMEN. AMEN. Let us preach the word &gt;&gt; straight DOWN THE LINE. &gt;&gt; I WILL not compromise. Is there one here that wants to raise your hand and says, "I'm laying aside MY OPINION. I'M LAYING ASIDE MY INTERPRETATION. As the world as the world goes one way, I'm going with Christ. I'm going with Christ. Eve. [cheering] Eve. Eve knew the truth but wouldn't walk in it. We know the truth. &gt;&gt; Let us walk in it. &gt;&gt; In a world of chaos. Remember what I said at the start. God can't be displayed in perfection. God requires chaos in a struggle. Christ is displayed. And when everything's falling apart, you stand. Christ is displayed. Amen. Amen. Make one more comment and we'll sing a song. A lot of people say the message is bondage. I grew up in the message. Can I say it felt like bondage for a while? I wanted to do certain things that I wasn't allowed to do. But the problem was I wasn't in love with the message. But when I met him, it went from bondage to love. I might like a certain thing, but because of love, I lay it aside. So the dos and the don'ts in the message, whatever they are, you know what they are to me, they're not dos and don'ts, but it's God telling me what pleases him. So naturally in a marriage, husbands want to please their wives. They want the wife to love them. Wives want to please the husband. So God is saying, "If you wear those shorts, they don't please me. If you wear that garment, it doesn't if you listen to that love song, it doesn't And the bride says, "Lord, I want to please you. &gt;&gt; I want to please you." &gt;&gt; And if that's not your desire, God can change it. God can change your desire. I want to live under a kind of atmosphere that pleases the heavenly bride. I want to leave live under a certain atmosphere that clears the goats out. &gt;&gt; Preach the word, brother. Jesus would say, "MY SHEEP KNOW MY VOICE. If what I'm saying sounds like a goat, check it with the word. Check it with the word. MY SHEEP The message shouldn't be making your life quality worse. &gt;&gt; The message shouldn't be making your life quality. Amen. But &gt;&gt; let me please my bridegroom. &gt;&gt; Let me please my bridegroom. Amen. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing is at weddings often you see in a natural wedding the worst of a person comes out. Makeup, music, alcohol. Is that same here? It's in Australia. Message believers affiliated with a message. Sorry, I'm talking fast. Suddenly the worst comes out in a person. Or is it what they really are is coming out? Let me be Christlike. Let me be a message believer above all else. Let me be Christlike. And people get this worldly love song. There's an atmosphere behind it. THERE'S A SPIRIT. There's a spirit in me that says it's wrong. I must go and listen to that spirit. People find a song, attach it to their relationship, love, worldly and says this song describes our relationship. What spirit are we inviting into our relationship? What spirit are we inviting? We should never be ignorant of these things. Spirits never die. There must be a discernment in the believer. Throw the love songs in the bin. Throw it out. THROW THE LOVE SONGS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I WANT TO GO IN A RAPTURE. I WANT TO GO IN A RAPTURE. I might love certain thing. I love sport, but I must lay it aside. Be it unto me according to your word. We have weaknesses in our life. Satan knows the weakness. music, sport, popularity, money, women, and he'll poke that spot all your life long. All your lifelong. There's no prayer that we can pray to remove the temptation. The temptation, the temptation is there to prove the bride. Close. Let's sing a song. I could go all night. You are an amazing group of people. Depression. &gt;&gt; God bless you. [applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You sing that song. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is all I need. Jesus is all I need. &gt;&gt; Sing a song. I'm walking on the beauty. I'm walking on the beauty.

See that Satan is trying to get a compromise out. Maybe you just want to slip up your hand and say, "Oh God, give me strength. Lord, I don't want to degrade the message. Lord, title message believers with a responsibility to &gt;&gt; and to Christ. Let's just pray. Dear Lord Jesus, Lord, you are the fountain of life. Lord, we've had your word. Let us never take your word for granted. [music] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, you see each hand. You see the heart behind the hand. I ask, oh God, come and touch each one in a [music and singing] Oh God, sweep over the congregation. Touch them, oh God. Lord, let us never compromise. Let us take a stand here this evening.
