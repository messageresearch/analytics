[Music] and we are reading verses from verses 7. [Music] and we will read verses 7 and 8. [Music] how many appreciate the presence of god [Music] once again he limited a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it said today if you will hear his voice having not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest then would he not after what have spoken of another day for the people of god for he that is entered into his rest he also has uh seized from his own words as god did from years verse 8 [Music] [Music] the holy spirit then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you and when he had so said he showed unto them his hands and his side and then where the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send are you and when he associate this he breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the holy ghost whosoever sins you remember they are admitted unto them and also ever since he retained they are retained [Music] [Music] amen i mean amen sing this with me other cross at the cross where i fought saw the light and the bird and my heart rolled away it was there by faith i received my son and now [Music] why jesus christ died on the cross so that we might be able to receive the holy spirit in our souls we were born in a way that was perverted and if we die without a change taking place in our souls there is no more sacrifice for sin foreign [Music] is actually within the uh within the word almost you see when you receive the word whoa actually receive the blood and when you reject the word you have rejected the problem that the life of the blood is to enforce the power [Music] but you have not received the holy ghost yet you have not yet received the enforcer today it is the holy spirit which is the enforcer yeah take some of them supposed to leave egypt and everybody knows so that they can go and possess the land back in never tourism which god had promised i can't even make you ever soon so we have been able to see together that before they could be able to attain the land that even never tried to see the promised land in central business they had to go listen to me they had to go through a series hallelujah of of things but you know peter moving into everywhere and one and we noticed that when they that before they could apply that blood are you following me there was something that was required hallelujah so there was something that was required why do we actually target one and that could not be attained without a messenger of the hour was equipped with a message which was going to give these people an hour and turn the revelation they needed to have it in order to move from the place where they were for everybody to go and attain the promise which god had given you never to add it to you and that messenger was moses and one mother came down moses did not come back down with his thoughts let me tell you what there was [Applause] is [Applause] [Music] nominational messages [Music] is is hallelujah testament [Music] amen and did you know that the people is [Music] but that is hallelujah [Applause] we have to listen to the messages no matter how a man can preach [Music] no matter how annoyed is uh them um the message away from the age of death blood is the holy spirit they do not have the revelations right is [Music] i'm happy to see you tonight [Music] [Music] anymore our generation us anymore you cannot remain
