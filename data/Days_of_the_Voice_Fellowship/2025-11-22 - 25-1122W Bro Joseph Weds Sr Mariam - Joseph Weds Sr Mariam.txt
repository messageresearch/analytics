Give it a little bit of a shout. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Well, who gives this woman to be married to this man? Amen. Okay, brother Joseph, you can step forward over this side. Okay. All right. [snorts] If you didn't change your mind up to now, you can now hand overseph. You can &gt;&gt; Yeah, it's okay. Can step down. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on. Receive your bride. &gt;&gt; God bless you so much. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh dearly beloved, we are gathered together in the sight of God today and in the presence of these witnesses to join together Joseph Mary and Mariam in the bonds of holy matrimony. according to the ordinance of God, the custom of the Christian church, the laws of this nation, and to implore on their behalf the blessing of God. Now, before we proceed, I just maybe ask brother Joseph to slowly move. Maybe you can give us a song. Just bring his bride up so that everybody can see properly. &gt;&gt; Can we have a song please? Maybe they just the singers can sing. Brother Shalom. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; me [singing] [music] and then nothing [music] else would [singing] you. You know, love me. [music and singing] Heat.

Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Except the uh the Lord build the house. the labor in vain that build it. So we are here to implore the blessing of God because it is God who builds a house. Marriage is honorable and holy asset instituted by God in the garden of Eden. It was there that the Lord God said, "It is not good that man should be alone." Eve was then fashioned from the rib of Adam. and give unto him for a wife. And then it was recorded that therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife, and they shall be one flesh. It is sanctioned and honored by Jesus Christ's presence at the marriage in Cana, which is really a type of Christ and his church. So God ordains it as the foundation and bond of family life for the mutual help and comfort of a husband and wife and for the welfare of the state. Marriage therefore is not to be entered in unadvisably lightly, but it should be entered into reverently, discreetly, soberly, and in the fear of God. So into this holy estate these two people uh these two persons now desire to enter by being joined together as one. Therefore if any man can show any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined together. Please declare it now. Just look around in the room to make sure that there's no one there. Now, if you're not there now and say forever, hold your peace. Amen. Moreover, I charge you both before God in search of all hearts that if either of you know of any impediment why you may not lawfully be united in marriage. Now you confess be sure that you will surely answer the day of judgment. when the secrets of all heart shall be disclosed. If there is either of you that know of any impendment, why you should not be lawfully joined together in this. You also are sure that so many as are joined together otherwise and God's word does allow. They are not united by the Lord. Neither is their marriage blessed by I'd like us to pray before you are seated and then usually I just take it to the word first but uh you know the couple today has desired that I do the wedding first the so let us humble ourselves and pray a loving Jesus author of life. Lord, we are here this morning in honor of your word. We have heard you know that marriage started with you for you started this institution. Lord, for the mutual comfort of husband and wife, for them to be able to have a unit, a family unit where they can Lord serve you. the ambassadors of the kingdom of God. Raise up, Lord, a family that will worship you and live for you. Lord, we are so thankful this morning, for brother Joseph, and for sister Mariam and for their decision that they have made to enter into this holiest day. I ask Lord your blessing upon this ceremony today, your grace and Lord upon the people that are attending today and even those that are streaming this morning ceremony. Bless each and every one of us. [snorts] May it be a wonderful time that will stay in our memories for a a very long time. Lord, seeing family and friends coming here to witness this wonderful thing, Lord, I pray that you bless everyone. And even as we shall share the word later, you be a source of blessing to us. We ask these things believing in Jesus name. Amen. Please be seated. Maybe the bride and groom, if you want to stand, that's okay. I'm going to go to the Let us first give the Lord a clap of praise. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; I just want to before we continue to uh thank all of you who have come today to be a part of this ceremony of our precious brother Joseph &gt;&gt; and sister Mariam. And uh I just saw Pastor Robert step in shortly. &gt;&gt; Thank you for honoring uh these young people and I know he was a pastor to brother Joseph for a season. We are so honored to have you sir. God bless you all those who have come, the friends, the family. Well, as I've um as I've highlighted, we're just going to go to the vows straight away first and then we shall share the word. Duly believing that you have considered this solemn obligation you are about to assume and that you have prepared to enter upon the same reverently discreetly soberly in the fear of God. I'd like to propose to you the marriage concept. Our Lord Jesus Christ has given us his promise to always be with us. For we know that he as the unseen guest is here now. How many believe? Amen. Is here to witness the promises that you will now make. And so at this moment, I'd like to turn to you, brother Joseph, and to ask you a question. And yeah, I don't know if I can get an extra microphone. &gt;&gt; Joseph, do you take Mariam to be your wife to live together according to God's ordinance in holy state of matrimony? Will you love her? I just don't. I know it's a ceremony, but I want you to listen to these words carefully. No stress, internalize everything. Will you love her? Will you comfort her? Will you honor and keep her in sickness and in health and forsaking all others faithfully keeping yourself to her alone? As long as both of you shall leave, did you hear? Oh, praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, then maybe you can pass the microphone to &gt;&gt; Sister Mariam. &gt;&gt; Do you accept Joseph Mary to be your husband? Joseph to live together according to God's ordinance in the holy set of matrimony. Will you love him, comfort him, honor and keep him in sickness [snorts] and in health and forsaking all others faithfully faithfully keep yourself to him alone as long as you both shall live? Yes, I will. &gt;&gt; All right. She said she will. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. And &gt;&gt; well, there's different ways of doing it, but I'd like, you know, for them to take their vows when Joseph is seeing her clearly. So, if you can step forward and slowly take off the veil, unveil your bride &gt;&gt; and then you can give her your promises thereafter. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You want to read the words or Okay. Right over this line. You take her by the hand and I Joseph Mary &gt;&gt; do take you Mariam to be my wife. I promise that even as Christ has loved his church, so shall I. So shall my love be to you. I'll love you, care for you, nourish you and cherish you. &gt;&gt; I give myself for you till we together are united with him. And I say also unto thee, as for me and my house, we shall serve the Lord. Amen. [applause] Praise the Lord. [applause] You can say after me or you can read the word submit it. Let's show her. &gt;&gt; You marry Joseph? &gt;&gt; Can you take away the flower and take your husband's hand? Okay. Do take you Joseph Mary. to be my husband. I place my hand in yours to be by your side as you walk with the Lord Jesus in his love. I will submit to you and re and reance to you. Wherever you go, &gt;&gt; I'll go whether I will Lord. Your people shall be my God and your God shall be my God. I will request a token. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Well, &gt;&gt; she said she requests a token. You better bring a token then. &gt;&gt; All right. Um, let's first pray over these rings. Our kind heavenly father, we know that these rings is a token. is just a symbol of the love that these two share in their life. Whoever Lord that will see these rings on their fingers, may it Lord not only show the love that they have for each other, but may you also project the love of God in their hearts, Lord, to the people. May it be a living testimony. The Lord while the generation Lord is living the way they want to live. There is a group of people in this world that are willing to live the life that is worthy of the gospel. A life that is separated. Nazarites unto the Lord. Father Lord we ask that this will be um uh will be more than just a symbol. We ask that you will grant it, Lord. in Jesus name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Well, you can you can place the ring on our finger maybe if you want to. Wow. I think what we're going to do is more than the flower. Would you want to take the flower? &gt;&gt; Can you take the microphone? This ring is a &gt;&gt; This ring is a symbol of my I give it to you. In remembrance of our marriage. Hallelujah. [applause] Amen. This ring is a symbol of my you know may these rings continue to be to you both a symbol of the value and the devotion of true wedded love and a seal of the vows that you have now made. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. [applause] Hallelujah. So you are actually married. [applause] You may want to embrace your bride. &gt;&gt; [laughter] [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, I'd like to invite Pastor Robert to come and assist me and uh we offer prayer for this couple. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Just come. Can you play?

Let's give another clap to the Lord. [applause] Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, it's a joy of the parents and the pastors whenever young people, you know, get to get to this level of their life and um, you know, time is already fast spent according to their program. for maybe 20 or 30 minutes. I just want to you to give me your undivided attention. I've never done it this way before to you know I always first give the word but I think this is better because then they are relaxed and they can hear the word. So let us now get into the scriptures and I just want to to share just a little thought on giving in love. John 3:16. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life. Now you cannot love. Now I'm meant to speak to them. So let me change my position. so that I can be in a place where they can see me well. &gt;&gt; Okay. So where I can see you well I'm addressing you although they are witnesses. So you cannot love and I I think you chose a very good song. have lifted me. But you cannot love and and without giving. You cannot love and not give. Or you cannot give if you do not love. For God so loved the world. When he loved the world, what did he give? He gave his only begotten son. So love and giving is embedded together. Now God expressed his love for us in Christ. And then in Romans 8, he says, "What shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?" I believe Mariam can say this morning, "If Joseph be for me, who can be against me?" Why? Because he knows that Joseph loves him loves her. So he that he that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall he not with him also freely GIVE US ALL THINGS? Shall lay anything to the charge of God's. It is God that justify Because of the love God had for his ill, he could not hold back. He could not spare HIS SON. HE willingly delivered him for us all. His son was an expression of his thoughts and character. It was God himself made manifest in the flesh. You know in John uh John John 1 it says in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that. And now listen. He says and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory of as of only begotten of the father full of grace and truth. I want you to see brother Joseph Mariam. First it was a thought then became the word and then came into manifestation. And 1 John 3:5 it says, "And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins, and in him is no sin." Now the scripture says that he gave HIMSELF AS a ransom for all. Think about it. God himself coming in the likeness of sinful flesh. JESUS WAS NOT just a second person of the trinity. IT WAS GOD HIMSELF COMING in the likeness of sinful flesh so that he would condemn sin. What was it? It was love. It was love that brought him down to the earth. It was love that put him on the cross. IT WAS LOVE THAT TOOK HIM to the grave. It was love that took HIM TO THE LOWEST HELL. You know this kind of love never fails. He rose up triumphant and HE IS ALIVE TODAY and his love has drawn ALL OF US TO him and we can never fall away. SO BECAUSE HE LOVED US, [screaming] HE GAVE EVERYTHING. HE GAVE himself he gave everything. So when we say he gave he gave for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son. People think here was God and he gave someone else. He said, "Oh, I love those people so much. My child, go and die for me." That's not the way it was. Remember, it was a thought, then a word, then it came into manifestation. So Jesus was the thought of God expressed. That's why he's called the word OF GOD. SO IN OTHER WORDS, JESUS WAS GOD MADE MANIFEST in flesh. So in other words, God gave HIMSELF TO COME and die for the ones he loved. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO be lost. It is even impossible for us, THOSE WHO HE DIED FOR, to be deceived. It is IMPOSSIBLE TO BE DECEIVED. WHY? Because of love. IMAGINE GOD HIMSELF COMING DOWN FROM glory living. You know in Philippians 2 he says let this mind be in you as it was in Christ Jesus who was in the form of God but told no rather to be evil than God but took upon himself the form of a servant and because he WAS FOUND IN A FASHION AS A MAN. HE was God but he was found in a fashion AS A MAN. SO WHAT did he do? He humbled himself and he died on the cross. What was that? That is what we call the love of God because he loved us. HE COULD NOT DELEGATE THIS WORK to an angel. You could not delegate this work to you know to a any human being because the Bible SAYS FOR ALL HAVE SINNED AND ALL HAVE come short of the glory OF GOD. SO there was no human being that could save us from sin. THERE WAS NO ANGEL. I want you to imagine when Adam and Eve sinned. I'm sure you know the all the angels must have wanted to come and save the day. BUT God told them, "This is mine to do. All of you hold your peace. You cannot go down there." THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO. GOD HAD A PLAN. And I will tell you WHAT THE PLAN WAS. THE PLAN WAS THAT HE HIMSELF WILL COME DOWN AND CONCERN AND HUMBLE HIMSELF IN HUMAN FLESH. THAT IS HOW MUCH HE LOVED. [screaming] HE GAVE HIMSELF. SO WHEN Jesus died, it was GOD DYING. NOW WE KNOW GOD CANNOT DIE. GOD CANNOT BELIEVE. SO THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO CREATE THAT FLESH. IN THE womb of Mary in order to bleed and die. &gt;&gt; He gave himself. And here is another part when Adam, you know, the Bible says in Phil in first Timothy, it says chapter two that the woman listen was in the transgression not the man but the woman because when the serpent came, the serpent came to the woman and deceived her. And when the woman was deceived, then she came to her husband and told her about what happened. You see, Adam had a a choice to say, "No, I will not be a part of this." But you know what? Adam knew one thing. IF I PARTAKE OF WHAT MY WIFE HAS DONE, she will not die because I am her redeemer. But the reason why she cannot die because I also have a redeemer. REMEMBER ADAM WAS A PART of God. You know, GOD SPOKE HIM INTO EXISTENCE. HE WAS A PART OF GOD. He came from the thought and the mind of God. He was in the image and the likeness of God. SO NOW HE KNEW BECAUSE I'M A PART OF GOD FOR ME TO BE DESTROYED, IT MEANS GOD must be destroyed. BUT if I leave my woman, my wife to be destroyed. Well, she can be destroyed, but I cannot let her be DESTROYED BECAUSE ADAM [screaming] loved his wife. So what did HE DO? HE DECIDED, OH MY, HE DECIDED to give HIMSELF FOR HIS WIFE. ADAM KNEW WHAT HE WAS DOING. THAT [screaming] ACT WAS THE ACT OF REDEMPTION. He was redeeming her because he became a part of what she was. And when Adam fell, the entire human race FALL that's why you are born in sin without doing any wrong OR GOOD. YOU ARE a sinner. Can you IMAGINE THAT? BUT WHEN GOD SAW THAT HE SAID I CANNOT LEAVE MY PART, I CANNOT LEAVE MY SON TO DIE JUST LIKE THAT. AND THIS ACT CANNOT BE DONE BY AN ANGEL MYSELF. [screaming] I HAVE TO GO DOWN AND GIVE myself and and and REDEEM HIM. SO THAT'S WHY JESUS CHRIST IS GOD HIMSELF MANIFESTED IN FLESH TO REDEEM FALLEN MAN. THERE IS no love without giving. So what is love then? First John 4:16. We have known and believed that the love we have known and believed the the love that God has to us. Have you known and believed it? God is love. Tell your neighbor, God is love. And he that dwelleth in love DWELLETH IN GOD AND GOD IN HIM. THE PUREST FORM OF LOVE. IS GOD'S LOVE CALLED? That is God is love. THEN WE KNOW ALL THE OTHER FORMS THAT WE call love which is really at a much lower level. I want I want to quote for you something. William Brandham the prophet of God in 1958 very outstanding. He said in 1958 in a message he was preaching called Ye must be born again. I want you to listen. He says anything that had a beginning has an end. It is those things which have not a beginning. It has no end. Did you ever think of that PERFECT LOVE? AFTER THAT PERFECT love then comes love from love. That's the love that you have for your wife. IF SOME MAN WOULD INSULT HER. If you had a gun, YOU WOULD SHOOT HIS BRAINS OUT. HE'S VERY JEALOUS. [screaming] VERY SELFISH BECAUSE IT CREATES A JEALOUSY BUT THAT'S FA SECONDARY LOVE THEN AFTER file follow me the first one the pure one the one I've been talking about isapola then comes but then on down after that comes last but people call it love. He's married but HE'S LUSTING AFTER ANOTHER MAN AND HE says I love you. Don't they use the same words? SO IS IT LOVE? IT IS LAST [screaming] AND THEN AFTER that comes comes filth. Then you find people you know having you know you know samesex relationship you know and THEY CALL IT LOVE BUT IT'S FILTH. THEN OF COURSE PROSTITUTION AND ALL IT JUST BECOMES PERVERTED. BUT ALL OF THIS KIND OF A LOVE HAD a beginning. BUT WHEN THE REAL [screaming] GENUINE LOVE OF GOD THAT I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COMES INTO THE HUMAN BEING BY THE NEW BIRTH BY BEING BORN AGAIN HAD NO BEGINNING AND YOU WILL HAVE NO END. YOU ARE THE SON OF GOD, MAN, and a daughter of God. And your affections are certain things ABOUT love will make you shoot a man for insulting your MARRIER WOULD MAKE YOU PRAY FOR HIS LOST SOUL. That's the difference. Amen. And that's WHY IT IS IMPORTANT FOR A BELIEVER TO MARRY A BELIEVER BECAUSE A BELIEVER [screaming] HAS THE LOVE OF GOD IN THEIR HEART. THAT IS BEYOND FEELINGS AND THAT CANNOT FAIL. THAT IS PERMANENT. IT HAS NO BEGINNING. IT HAS NO END. IT WILL KEEP A MARRIAGE STABLE THE WHOLE TIME. HALLELUJAH. THIS KIND OF A LOVE NEVER ENDS. IT IS PERMANENT. AMEN. SEE WHAT THE SCRIPTURE says about it in first Corinthians 13. Though I speak with tongues of men and of angels. I have not charity. What love is he talking about? He's not talking about love. uh uh he's not talking about uh you know fellow love or whatever he's talking about the love of God and he's saying even if I speak in tong with men of angels and have not charity I am become a sounding brass or a TINKLING SYMBOL AND THOUGH I HAVE GIFTS OF PROPHECY AND ALL AND UNDERSTAND ALL MYSTERIES AND ALL KNOWLEDGE AND THOUGH I HAVE ALL FAITH SO THAT I COULD REMOVE MOUNTAINS. BUT I DON'T HAVE THIS LOVE. I AM NOTHING. AND THOUGH I BESTOW ALL MY GOODS TO FEED THE POOR and though I give my body to be burned and I DON'T HAVE THIS LOVE, IT PROFITS ME NOTHING. THIS KIND OF LOVE SUFFERETH LONG. If you have that, this is what is going to happen in your marriage. It sufferth long, is kind, IT ENVIOUS NOT, FAITH NOT ITSELF, IT IS NOT PASTOR, DOES NOT BEHAVE itself unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinkketh no evil, does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices In the truth, IT BEARETH ALL THINGS, BELIEVETH ALL THINGS, ALL THINGS, ENDURETH ALL THINGS. THIS LOVE DOES NOT FAIL. But whether there be prophecies, it shall fail. Where there be tongues, they shall cease. Where there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. True love that does not seek her own is not selfish. So which means if you have this true love you will you will be able to give yourself in marriage for your partner for your wife. Joseph and Mariam I want you to remember you are coming together to start a home a place where you would have to learn to live for each other. for the joy, self-sacrifice, happiness of each other. You know, you you you are not little children. You've lived on this earth for some years, which means you are bent each of you in your own way. And you you are used to doing things your own way. But marriage is not a wedding. Marriage is not a wedding ceremony. You see, when you get into the real life now, you're going to realize you're with someone that has grown in some other place and you some other place. You're used to doing things differently, you know. And those of you who are married here, you know what I'm talking about, you can have differences even as something as small as how you use your toothpaste. And you find that you squeeze it differently. So and and you you just have to adapt and learn each other's ways and always be willing to give yourself for the happiness and joy of the other self-sacrifice. You want your your other partner to be happy. You know, one one time I was, you know, counseling a couple years ago and uh these were young people wanted to get married and then a a young lady, this young man wanted to marry this young lady and then you know she was interested and then later changed her mind and wanted to go with someone And then so he said, "Pastor, what can I do? I already GIVEN HER MY WHOLE HEART." I said, "Well, let's find out what the prophet of of God says about if you love her, you want her to be happy." So if she says she will be happier with another man since you want her to be happy you will tell her it's all right go with him you have my support and blessing and you not do it you do it willingly you're willing to give yourself sacrifice your desire sacrifice your feelings so that she can be happy so is it in marriage Please look at me. That's how it is going to be. Sister Mario, you have to learn to sacrifice each other's feelings and desires so the other can be happy. Give me give me five more minutes here. Ephesians 5 says, "Husbands, love your wives. Even as Christ also loved the church, here is the part. And gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the water by the word that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but it should be holy and without blemish. And then he says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his wife loveth himself. For no man can yet hat or rather ever yet hated his own flesh but nourisheth it and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church. Brother Joseph be willing to nourish to cherish Mariam mind about her spiritual welfare, her physical and emotional and financial welfare. That is the way you can give yourself for her. Let Christ be your headship. Let him that is love be the driving force [screaming] to express his character through you to your wife and sister Mariam. The scripture says wives submit yourselves unto your own husband as unto the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife. And as Christ is the head of the church, he is the savior of THE BODY. THEREFORE, the church is subject to Christ. So let the wives be to their own husbands. Sister Mariam, be willing to submit yourself to them as unto the Lord. REMEMBER, you should be willing to give and forsake all others. and give yourself only unto him. This is the type of the bride of Christ. You know, she forsook all the other lovers and only GAVE herself to him and him alone. You know, we have a bride in this last God is calling a bride out of the church. The church has gave herself to many others. The Bible talks about this woman with a cup of the wine of our fornication and has made many to drink of it. But there's a bride that has refused to drink from that. You know, you look at the screens today, you see the movie stars kissing, hugging and slopping up around all these women. A WOMAN THAT DOES THAT IS OF A BAD CHARACTER. She might be virtuous otherwise, but in her heart, when you know those sex glands meet in in the lips of a man kissing a woman and is actually potentially committed adultery, Now keep the church in mind. The denominational church is kissing and sloping and mixing around and everything in everything but the word. To believe in one God, you are giving yourself to the world. You are refusing to mix yourself with the things of the world. To be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, you're refusing yourself to mix up with the things. You are like a bride that is submitting herself to her Lord Jesus Christ. When both of you decide to cast selfishness aside and you give yourself When you let this love govern your home, a home where you will raise children trained in the ways of the world. I want to say this as I finish. If you do that, your union will never fail. I've had many times where people say when people marry get married young those marriages will fail. I've been a part of many marriages ceremonies of young people who are giving themselves to the Lord and his word first that union those have never failed. Why? Because he if he's the center of your marriage, if he's the center of your home, the center of your family, he cannot you cannot fail. I want to say God bless you both. God bless everyone of you.
