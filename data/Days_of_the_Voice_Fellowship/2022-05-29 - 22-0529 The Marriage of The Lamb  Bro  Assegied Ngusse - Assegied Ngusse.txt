take kids that accept your questions do you know do you understand me you need to be my children how can you be my children how can the wife make ready herself we can see it from the book of esther a good example for us on the book of esther it is an interesting story yes even as you know there was a king there was a king that king is a powerful king in the book of esther we see a powerful a powerful king even this king esther chapter one from verse one and the two pretty much double ch it says how much powerful this king is now it came to pass in the days of asuras are surahs which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over 170 provinces that in those days when the king asuras sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in the place the palace the palace [Music] [Music] mean amen you see this king kabakkon he is powerful and his provinces are over 120. [Music] starting we're counted as much as 120 he was having all these kingdoms being a kindness of this being of this all provinces you when he requested her to come and to show her beauty for the people instead she stayed there and she had her own ceremony and she refused for the king that she will not come because she has her own ceremony here with other women she has forgotten who she is how she becomes yeah how she becomes even a king you do not want to recall she don't want to recognize the powers of the king he was very upset so they were about seven servants he servants so they bring a solution for the king and the uh and these servants they they propose him a good proposal for the king amina what did they propose we are also very upset for what is what she has done for you [Applause] when we are saying even when the cervantes propose this issue for the king [Applause] therefore they propose this uh good proposal so he was very pleased by the idea he comes you know so asuras was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her then said the king cervantes that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the prophecies of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgins anto shushan the pla the place the palace to the houses of the women unto the custody of hege the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them uh which pleases the king be killed instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so ah ah god is now requiring or god is now waiting for that uh marriage the love's marriage until he finds someone instead of vashti hallelujah amen so based on these uh points the king announces for every province or from every provinces these young men young uh young ladies young virgins starts to come for whose name is his uncle's daughter for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mardukai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter um [Music] doesn't matter whether you are father or mother sing song it doesn't matter w it doesn't matter if you have grown up in a poor family or it doesn't matter whether you have grown up in a rich family it doesn't matter what matters is the character you have in you so she becomes one of the mates [Music] and the maiden verse 9 and the maiden pleased him and she obtained the kindness of him and he speedily gave her her things for purification with such things as belonger to her and seven medals which were meant to be given her out of the king's house and he preferred her and her meds enter the best place of the house of the women [Applause] he was more pleased by esther is during her preparation time before she goes to the king again she starts to get favor in the eyes of the keepers of the woman which belongs to the uh the king i want to know the name hallelujah amen once your character is good and peace that's why god was obligated to send us a prophet to there are many denominations who have mixed the things of god with the things of human beings in our way of uh reading even the bible in our way of getting revelation from the bible these all things are the process of preparation for us to meet the king this is how you are going to purify yourself [Music] [Music] you see the difference between esther and the other maps king ahasuras after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of the woman for so where the days of their purifications accomplished 2 weeks six months with oil of mile and six months with sweet others and with other things for the purifying of the women this uh then just came every maiden unto the king whatsoever whatsoever remember what i told you whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the houses of the women and to the king's house every christians who call themselves christ christians as long as they believe in jesus christ they have the right to receive the holy ghost and the the desires of these christians is different from the desires of the bride as long as whatever you want if you want a prophecy you want he can give you prophecy any christian who wants miracles [Music] [Music] she knows what her desire is hallelujah amen hallelujah bye man what what you desire today is your desire to meet our lord jesus christ it is nothing for the lord [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] amen who have taking her for his daughter was come to go in under the king she required nothing but what hege the king's chamberlain the keepers of the women appointed and esther obtained favor in the sightings of all them that looked upon her originated [Music] other than what he gave her she deserves nothing else hallelujah this message can take us to meet our lord jesus christ you of god the character in him if it can be found in you you are the kings of jesus christ i oh there are three uh uh there are three uh types of uh houses or there are three houses of the women why do houses there are three house of the women house of the women you see first they were where they stayed from different provisions those who are virgin only who live there you have no any relationship with the king or at any time it might took them for more than one year for them to purify themselves before they go to the kingdom of hallelujah amen so the second house of the woman catching new men is when that virgins each when they called those young girls after they come out from the house of the kings if he does not call them by their name they will not return back they will just go out from the house and but so they have uh you know they have a communion with the king once then when they go out the second house will be those who have a relation with the king but they were not called by him they were not elected by him house of the women those are concubines but as long as the king has some relation with them they have the right to ask anything to what they want they are under the kingdoms of that the other denominations they think they know jesus christ [Music] because they receive the gifts of the holy spirit they don't know the persons of the holy spirit yes under christianity god will give them the prophecy god reigns that our holy spirit on their denomination and they can have a big worship name they can sing a song they can beautify their amen hallelujah amen that is being a wife of jesus christ [Music] yes and give honor to him because for the marriage of the lamb [Music] his wife has made herself ready you have make you have make self read you have make self ready yourself yeah you have made already yourself why do you know we will come together with jesus christ made a great feast unto all his praises and his cervantes even esther's feast and he made a release to the provinces and gave gifts according to the states of the king
