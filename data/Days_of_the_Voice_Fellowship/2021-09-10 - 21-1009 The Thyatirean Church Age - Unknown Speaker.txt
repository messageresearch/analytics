were with us also by way of zooms uh uh john god bless you there saquero god bless you and uh my wife usually attends in the background there you know with the children she's always in the cry room so she always attends via the zoo here so god bless you also uh you know if you could have a fist surprise are they okay what about the sister that brother martin is one okay fine so we want to utilize our time and straight away go to the theater and chat and we we started the temple church age um last week friday and uh some of you missed that because we didn't stream it we had the internet uh we had power problem our power was off here so we did not stream uh for obvious reasons but then also we covered until uh page 221 which was european the people of tatira or the believers of batteries meaning to uh near the end of the age as much as we shall be able to cover today usually i don't want to plan things because i want you know this bible study i wonder what spiritually they want to drive us on everything if the speed drives you then uh you can always encourage just a bus or a live or something like that and then you will accomplish this purpose just just through that so you don't want to find yourself possibly finish the chapter when you form what nothing you know you want to find yourself following his leadership amen and so i'm going to put this that can can you try to connect that speaker so i can try to see if you can get audio here okay so we're just trying to get our orders here in order for us to before first okay all right [Music] first yes oh me [Music] [Music] me [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] but we are filled with a spirit [Music] oh yes that's the old time saving and you know that the thing said oh oh i like the old time singing preaching shouting praying [Music] i i [Music] is [Music] okay so we seem to be having issues with our audio but we can connect and hear from revelation 2 19 i know thy works and i patience and thy works and the last to be here again three remarks it works the son of god himself said believe me for the very work's sake he put an emphasis on his own works while on earth the works that he did were ordained of god to inspire faith in him it was a great part of his ministry his holy spirit and the apostle paul said for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath ordained that we should walk in them ephesians 2 10 these works were to inspire faith in him as they would show forth that relationship to him that paul described as created in him now works will never take the place of faith in god for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of a saved life as fruit unto the lord amen it is now what will take the place of faith in god for our salvation in other words it says now what will never take the place of faith in god for our salvation in other words words cannot replace faith you cannot say that you are saved by your words that because you dress well that means you are saved because you speak well that means you are because you baptize yourself you understand yes that's why some people believe that it is what about this that saves them it is not a trudeau dream there is no thing that you do in this life that gives you salvation that's right nothing tell but there is no one that can see salvation without christ every work that we do all the works which we do it only shows our faith which we have already blessed in him very nice what do you get for whatever place in the name of all of jesus christ you are showing your faith with you you already pressed in christ while you dress well you are showing your faith with your brother possessed in christ why do you stop you know fornication you are showing your faith which you have read a place in christ so the things that you do only shows your faith with your brothers here right come on somebody are you following this so good words won't save you but they will come forth out of a safe life as fruit unto the lord sister fortunately just missed something wonderful here you know you say the good works cannot save a man yes what you do will not save you but if you don't do it you're not saved that's right that's right because he said that he shall know them by their wax it is by their works by your watch the people will know you the bible says if you love one another jesus said if you love one another they shall not they who the people of the world believe that they shall know that you are my disciples in other words what you do shows who you are tells people your words tell people who you are in me in christ your words show tell the people who you are let me bring israel your words show that people your position in christ whether it is in christ or in the devil that's right amen so he says that once we show forth our faith which you have rather placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth i would say other uh of a saved life as real and you know oh my isn't that wonderful and then he said i believe in good works so someone said what's what said you therefore don't worry my sister bless the way you want god doesn't see your wax he sees your heart amen you know you know what you do it doesn't matter it doesn't really matter what you dress what you do it all matters you know what you believe you know this is what some of our people here are preaching you know what your faith is you know you can see how they can miss their life the line is still now very now yes we believe what's going to save you right yes we believe i do believe that there's nothing we do that will ever give you salvation right yes whether good or bad doesn't give you some question but your words show who you are there is no look friends let give me a moment here i just i wanted to leave this by the way speed was saying you know stay there for a while all right for somebody here look we have a mango tree right here i've got in our in our little garden here in the compound but what good is this that feels now let me ask you a question for two three years we've been here for three years that number three has been there right yes did it have a mango for us please no no it seems to be a mango tree no no it's been a manga tree even without fears that's why we say we do not know who the children of god are we do not know who the seed of god are but here's the secret oh father he pushed the veteran he said that he will make sure that he sees that whatever the city must produce his kind yes the seat must produce his kind and the seed of god he will make sure that he will ensure that his sin doesn't you know depart he he trusts he has confidence in his seat you know god has confidence in his sister and he is what i'm trying to say now that mango tree is a mango tree even without the fruits a child of bone is the child of god even without that truth whether they address trousers when they are women whether they use makeup or not whether they go for fornication or not before they know christ if their children know their children oh god there's somebody right now doing those things but when they are the bread of christ and they don't even have an idea about it right because they have not yet found who they are they don't know who they are but i'm saying he was never you know slamming the denominations the people in the illumination but he was slamming the systems it's a systems which get those people you know imprisoned in that kind of uh understanding but the people are people of god in there there is a bride of christ but here is the important thing here the secret is god who is the husband man god who is the owner of the seed god knows who they are where are you he knew you even before you knew him that's why we [Music] you must do who has got to join me like i have god bless you my sister after you have come to the realization of the season of who you are you must bring forth fruit amen that mango tree has been there for two years since it was planted and never did we ever see a freedom but it did not become a proper tree it's going to be the mango tree but now it just flowers and it's doing important so how pretty why is it it's just the right season for you to bring forth us if he doesn't bring the mangoes in this season that actually must be cut off it is of no use it's not because it is not it it's a clear sign it's not the right type of tree or the red sea now those who claim to be christians those who came to be followers of christ and their words are evil satanic wildly when they are claiming to be of christ one year three years fear is a clear sign they are not treatment of christ amen because it's the truth of christ their words will matter when they come to christ hallelujah so you see what it says here oh man i just forgot that that is so wonderful yes so wonderful i i wanted to see what he says here he says no watch will never now rush will never take a place of the faith in god for our salvation but what will show for our faith already blessed in hallelujah because i'm a christian i'm going to stop wearing many scars because i'm a christian i'm going to stop wearing trousers if i'm a woman because i'm a christian i'm going to stop drinking why simply because i realize i've come in the season of realization of who [Music] show me your faith without your wrath show for the works you must be changed let us continue i believe in good works even if a man is not saved he ought to do good works and do the best he can what is horrible in the sight of god is for men to do evil works and then say that they are doing the will of the lord that is what the bishops and popes and the hierarchy of rome were doing they were killing maiming and doing all manner of evil in the name of the lord they lived out lives exactly opposite to what the word teaches in that evil day those true believers shone like a light in a dark place as they continually did good for they returned cursing with blessing and did the truth to honor god even though many died for it in this verse he is commending his children because they were living changed lives testified to a new spirit within men saw their good works and glorified god yes sir if you are a christian you are going to do what is right your works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something that you put on for you will do his will when no one but god sees you and you will do his will even if it costs you your life i know your love service faith and patience you will note that their love is placed between works and service and that is the right place for it because without love our works are not accepted before god and neither is our service paul speaking to the corinthians said without love i am nothing and whatever i do is without profit unless it is done in love now you can see right here that these believers weren't in that nicolaitan class that did works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of god that was shed abroad in their hearts by the holy ghost that love in their hearts was god's love for his own jesus said by this shall all men know that you are my disciples that you have love for one another the pagans who saw the lives of the early christians said behold how they love each other john said everyone that loveth is born of god what you are doing are you doing it out of love or are you doing it out of you know don't pretend as if you've never understood what i'm saying even if it is sure right that is why i don't really i'm not so much inclined on these public offertories you know it seems to have kind of uh lost meaning that that teaching that jesus was teaching was that he told when he was a man how a woman came to live and uh she gave her a few and a rich man came and he also gave much but you know the way he was busting and moving and how yeah woman just put in a little you know what she had but jesus said yep they both gave but when jesus was trying to talk about their giving he said that uh who gave the most why because the woman did that with love with all her heart she made what she did she did not do it for let them know that i am the one who is the kind let them also realize that i can you understand everybody gives one thousand two thousand one thousand two thousand and then you bring fifty thousand let them know that i'm the one who cares but some people have again used that to say where you should give a point and now they take a point because jesus you know for many that man who gave a point so they also bring your calling because they want to be like they are a woman you are like the other rich man also you see you're not like a woman because if you are like the old woman you you will business here that old man was sincere she gave everything she had are you giving everything you have when you give a point you see that's what i'm saying and it does also it does not also mean that you should give all that you have to be pleased by god i mean to please god right it's not like saying you should give all you have to please god if he has rebuilt you should give all your heart to peace but then do it and giving should be out of your heart not out of what others out of what you want others to see about you to know about you then uh it's also trying to give a coin to be like the other woman when you have to the color yes you leave it there in your pocket and then you take a coincidence you know you are just lying yourself you are eco friend you know you are like the other rich man you know you see so if you have much give much if you have little give it in others give whatever that you have it's not only in giving it's also in doing do all that you can for the glory of god not for your own growth not for your vein glory i would say you should not do something out of vague glory but we should do whatever we do out of the will of god for the for the glory of god not for our being glory not for them to see me to know me to love me to praise me but i want to do everything i do for the glory of the name of my god hallelujah so when you're coming here even in bible study or church or going anywhere for the sake of the work of the lord are you doing it because others have told you or because you want others to see you you must do it out of a true heart not out of uh men that are kindness you see this first john 4 seven i want to give a warning right here it says concerning the last days that because of abounding iniquity the love of many will wax cold in the laodicean or last age self love and love for material things will take the place of the true love of god we need to guard against the power of sin in these last days so many are getting so hard because they haven't realized the effect of this last day spirit it is time to draw an eye to god and let him fill our lives with his love or we will feel the coldness of the last day church and reject the truth of god which alone is able to help us in those dark and dreadful years the true vine held its love for god and love of the brethren god commanded them for it i know your service jesus said he that is greatest of all is servant to all a wise man commented on that saying here is what he said only history will prove the truth of that dictum that man was right all the truly great men of history have been servants they who demanded to be served they who oppressed they who sought to always be at the head have gone down in shame even the very rich are condemned by god when they have not used their wealth right all through the great men of history have been asked was jesus uh a servant jesus you said that they would they would be managed to be served they will oppress they were so to always be at the head i've always gone down here my brother even you at your home when you're with your siblings yeah i'm your i'm the biggest in this house you should do all of them you know that type of idea is always bad you remember how they used to oppress joseph but they all worshipped joseph but they used to oppress you so god can bring the littlest the humble yes the smallest among us and lift him up to serve us that's right and make him roar over us what i'm saying is if you want to be uplifted by god and best yourself humble yourself but if you want to be at best then you live to yourself the way up is down if you want to go up humble yourself do not at any time try to oppress others or control them do not at any time want to become lord over others you are not meant to be a lord of another god wants to be the one take that position yes even when you are someone's husband you you should not intend to just be a lord yes you are you could develop that you are our lord but don't try to show it be a servant christ was our lord but he was our servant imagine that kind of humility by the panel of preachers god hiding himself in the simplicity and revealing himself in the sense what is killing people why are people killing each other because each person wants to be on top of the other and to oppress and control their do not do that we should always see each other as though the other one is higher than me you see because you are the oldest or because you are the youngest because you are the richest or because you are one it doesn't make you any better you are the same you must have and don't don't try to make it out let it flow through you let it be a part of your life whereby christ will come and take over your life whereby your humble yourself you are really humble from your heart you you know this and that you know you kind of feel that others should be on below you and you should be up there brother and sister you go to prayer and ask god to feed you the horribles because it's a clear sign you have nothing to do you see jesus says i know your servants he wants us to be servants he doesn't want us to be loads over the others she wants us to be servants of one another oh my god but look into history and you will find that the truly great were those who served others history can never acclaim those for whom much was done but it will forever praise those who did much for others now let us apply that to ourselves even as the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister so we are to follow that example see him as he bows himself over the feet of the apostles and washes their tired and dirty feet he said you don't know now what i am doing but you will know him hereafter but what you see me doing you ought also to do he became a servant in order that god could elevate him to the highest heights and one day in the judgment of the saints we are going to hear him say well done good and faithful servant enter thou into the joy of the lord it is hard to be always a servant but those who spend and are spent for others will one day be seated with him in his throne it will be worth it all then let us labor for the master from the dawn till setting sun let us talk of all his wondrous love and care and when all of life is over and our work on earth is done and the role is called up yonder is is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] and when all of life is over because one day it's going to be over and our work on earth is that and the role is called up yon who will be there and one day the judgment of the saints we are going to hear him say well done good and faithful did you hear that well done good and faithful [Music] not wrong good pastor oh well what a grateful person some people don't call them [Music] a brother because he wanted to be a servant he wanted us to feel like for us to feel like he is one of us and he was one of us it's not our own suffering that we are worshiping your brother you know so well that would have faithful also nothing like that whether that would have faithful prophet whoever done as good as grateful stop entertaining the joker it is hard to always be a servant is it easy whereby everyone is the one who always tells you ah nani brush the shoes that need wash money do this do that sweep the i mean you know when sister fortunately entered in here i asked her i requested her to to promote their house i said since unfortunately can you please hear a person of this house i don't know how you felt sister but the prophet says it is not always going to blow them you know but each of us should always feel we are silenced when you reach a chat and you are under you are the first one there those are well let me wait for ya [Music] even when a person is rich even when a person is there is having a lot of money even when they are old even when they are whatever when they come to church and they are the first and they are the fastest especially in the african section i don't know about the european and american cities but you will come and you will find them sweeping the church that's right you will find them and they are not going to be paid for it they are doing it out of their own it is a service this kind of work let me tell you you're getting yourself a cast give yourself a blessing by being a servant yes he says well done right on faith how did you serve him you saw him by serving these people right amen you stop me by saving these people do what you do for others for the sake of his kingdom you are serving the lord you're being a servant yes hallelujah but those who spend a spanish those who spend and are spent for others will one day be sealed within your throne you spend your money you spend your time you spend your resources you spend your knowledge you spend you know your strength you spend everything you spend and you feel your suspense you feel your life has been given away you know what the song used to sing i gave myself away oh i give myself away so you can use me i give myself away giving myself away i give myself [Music] oh my life is not my own [Applause] i give myself to you oh my life is [Applause] one more time my life is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] myself i give myself away [Music] [Music] [Music] but also [Music] oh my dreams all my plans [Music] [Applause] i give myself away [Applause] [Music] [Music] myself away [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] myself i give myself to you lift up your youthful voice [Applause] [Applause] one more time [Applause] [Applause] i give myself to you hallelujah amen amen you give yourself a way to do all right you know when you realize that to be a servant is the most precious thing to him for you then you would indeed say i give myself let my life be a living sacrifice amen but those who spend understand for others will one day be seated hallelujah and one day be sitting with him in his throne it will be one with all this hallelujah you don't really want it all it will be what is it all to be a son yes hallelujah it's just wonderful and then you also tell them i know your faith let's follow that i know your faith now he does not say here as he did to the church in pergamos you hold my faith he is not talking about his faith now but he is commanding them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their patience now faithfulness and patience go together in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness for it says in james 1 3 the trying of your faith worketh patience there is absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of our faith romans 5 3 tribulation worketh patience how highly god regards this outworking of our patients is seen in james one four but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing god's will for us is perfection and that perfection is patience waiting on god and waiting for god this is the process of character development how highly god has commanded these saints of the dark ages patient as lambs led to the slaughter lovingly faithfully they served god that is all they wanted out of life just service to their lord how great was to be their reward i know i cannot pass this without talking about this he says right there okay right here he says now he does not say here as he did to the church in vegamos you hold my faith but he tells them he's not taking talking about his faith now his faith but he is commanding them for their faithfulness and as he does he also mentions their past things now faithfulness patients go together in fact patience is the outcome here patience is the outcome of faithfulness for instance in john james 1 3 the trying of your faith works patience you see so if you cannot say you have faith that you've been faithful without being uh a patient patience is the outcome of faithfulness because you've been faithful because you you you've been faithful to the death because you've been faithful because you've been faithful to his wife because because of your faithfulness we cannot say you have patience so that is how you get that you get to that level of patience by being faithful to his wife and of course will not be faithful without suffering certain things so you have to suffer those things and overcome them i know thy works and the last to be more than the first this is certainly remarkable as the darkness of the age increased as the honor roll of the martyrs grew lengthier day by day they worked all the harder they served all the more and their faith increased how tragic it was that in the ephesian age love waned and truly nothing is said of the increased labor of love in the other ages but in this age and the darkest of all ages they served him even more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the lord but rather an increasing of it that is the secret let the enemy attempt to thwart our service to the lord our reply is increased service when the faint are crying in fear that is the time to shout them let me try to do that our employees increase the services amen when the faith are climbed in fear that's the time to shout the victory hallelujah you remember that time when gideon was taken meant for war what i told him to tell all the fearful to go back at home so now right now when the enemy is trying to remove people from going to churches look our service has even increased the more however yeah we are going to have more services that we usually do how are they supposed to be to the living god hallelujah yes let them cry in fear but for us it's our time to i know thy works and the last to be more than the first now as we have already said this age is called the dark ages because it was indeed the darkest period of all history it was the age of pope innocent iii who claimed that he was the vicar of christ supreme sovereign over the church and the world who instituted the inquisition which under his direction shed more blood than at any other time except in the reformation it was the age of pornocracy the rule of harlots sargarius iii had a mistress and filled the papal choir with paramours and bastard sons and turned the papal palace into a den of robbers anastasius the third was smothered to death by morogia who was mistress to sargeras john the eleventh was morocia's illegitimate son john the twelfth was the grandson of morocia and he violated widows and virgins and was killed while in the act of adultery by the woman's enraged husband it was the age of papal schism for two lines of popes one ruling from avignon and the other from rome cursed and fought each other these popes were not only guilty of immoral sex acts fathering scores of illegitimate children committing sodomy etc but were guilty of selling priestly offices to the highest bidders it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few believers labored more fervently as the darkness increased until toward the end of the age many arose attempting reforms their labors were so fervent but they paved the way for the oncoming reformation therefore as the word says concerning that age your last end of the age works are more than the first the word thyatira has various meanings amongst which is continual sacrifice by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is a continual presentation of the sacrifice of christ that is an excellent thought but it might also mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the true believers of the lord surely these styetarian saints were the cream of the crop full of the holy ghost and faith created unto good works showing forth his praise holding not their lives dear unto themselves but gladly giving their all as a sweet sacrifice unto the lord the rebuke revelation 2 20 notwithstanding i have a few things against thee because thou sufferest tolerate that woman jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed to idols now with this verse i want you to drop down to verse 23 and see the proof of a great truth i have been bringing to your attention all along and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts i have been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them in each age as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are churches and it states just as plainly that some of these churches most evidently do not know that he is the one who searcheth the reigns and the hearts he is going to prove to them that is so now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth of course it is the false vine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of god and they being god fearing judge themselves that they be not judged now why does god call these churches his have you seen that yes he says now then yesterday okay it says he's going to prove to them now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth because it is the first fine group because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins [Music] they judge themselves that they've been object so you judge yourself now so that when he comes you are not jacked you see that's what we are as believers we know judgment is coming even those who are refusing to judge themselves now there is a day coming we've seen that sometimes there's a sad day coming a saturday coming there's a saturday coming by and by do you have the ones with the sunrise where all those ones who rejected the lord you know when they are going to their reward when they are going to the judgment at that time oh there's a saturday coming by and by you know but also it is a happy day for us it's a it's a happy day saturday for them happy day for those who would have already judged themselves today you preach something and someone says don't judge me don't judge me and then you know they say don't judge me now but don't worry if you don't want judgment now you will get another time that's right me when someone say don't judge me leave them alone i don't say anything else after that since that you're wearing a mini skirt don't judge me okay fine because you can buy it will give me this car no problem but there is a day where you will be judged if you have refused this judgment now that day you will not be able to escape that judgment how did what are we encouraging our people what are we encouraging you sisters and brothers we are encouraging you to overcome this kind of feeling that don't judge me allow christ to put you in order i allow the world to shape you you know you are just the great you know he is the porter you are the great hallelujah so i am the porter i am the clay you are the porter you know the song how does it go [Music] me [Applause] [Music] one more time i am [Music] oh [Applause] you should allow him to mold you the way he wants to mold you do not dare say that he's judging me don't judge me you know it's a religion of old people blah blah blah blah okay go ahead but don't worry there is a day coming did you hear that chorus of the uh they said they coming there's a day coming something like that did you get a first yes or no no all right you you can see if you can get it's a very very good one for some people really yeah i wish you you'll get those words it's very very good for us to sing it or for us to see the ones so that know how serious this thing is you know that day is coming and it is coming but you will you have the chance now when we have the chance now let us get yielded to him fully so that you can judge us now that judgment begins at the house of god and they being good fearing they judge themselves that they've been object and you know when you let yourself you don't need anyone to judge you because you're already standing right hard anyways amen shall we now continue [Music] okay i think we're just transferring now now why does god call these churches his churches even though they are the false vine the truth of the matter is that they are christians but they are not christians of the spirit they are christians of the flesh they are bearing the name in vain mark 7 7. how be it in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men but indeed they are christians for what else could they be a is a that is his religion no matter how he lives it because he subscribes in theory to what the quran teaches in the same way a christian is a christian as long as he subscribes to the fact that jesus is the son of god born of a virgin was crucified and died and rose again that he is the savior of mankind etc in fact in the laodicean age there will be those who call themselves christians because they subscribe to the fine qualities of jesus while reserving to themselves the right to deny his deity christian scientists have done that already as well as multitudes who preach a social gospel he is a nominal christian and belongs to the church but he is not a true or spiritual believer that kind of a believer is one who has been baptized into the body of christ and is a member of him but nonetheless it is in god's order that the tears grow up with the weed and they are not to be uprooted that is the command of god their day for binding and burning is coming but not yet so the spirit is speaking to this mixed group on the one hand he is praising and on the other he is rebuking he has told what is right with the true believer now he warns what the false vine must do if it is to stand justified before the lord that woman jezebel the apostle james showed us the course that sin takes james 1 14-15 but every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust and enticed then when lust hath conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it is finished bringeth forth death now that is a picture of exactly what is happening in the church ages as sin started in nothing but a feeling so the death to the church started with the simple little notice deeds of the nicolaitans from the deeds it went to a doctrine from the doctrine it embraced the power of the state and the introduction of paganism now in this age it goes to its own prophetess teacher and so it travels on until it will find itself in the lake of fire for that is exactly where it is going to end up in the second death now the whole cry of god against this fourth age is found in his denunciation of this prophetess jezebel and to understand exactly why he denounces her so we will have to look up her history in the bible and when we find what she did back there we will know what is going on at this time the first and very important thing that we learn about jezebel is that she is not a daughter of abraham nor is her induction into the tribes of israel one of spiritual admission as was that of ruth the moabitess no sir this woman was the daughter of ethbail first kings 1631 who was the priest unto astarte he had gained the throne by murdering his predecessor feliz so we see right away that she was the daughter of a murderer this certainly reminds us of kane and the way she became a part of israel was not through the spiritual channels that god had ordained for gentile admission but she came in by marriage to ahab the king of the ten tribes of israel now this union as we have seen was not spiritual it was political and so this woman who was steeped in idolatry did not have the least desire to become a worshiper of the one true god but rather she came with the avowed intentions of turning israel away from the lord now israel the ten tribes had already known what it was to worship the golden calves but as yet they were not sold out to idolatry for god was worshiped and the law of moses was acknowledged but from the time of ahab's marriage to jezebel idolatry progressed in a deadly fashion it was when this woman became a priestess in the temples that she erected to astarte venus and baal sun god that israel came to the crisis point of her life with this in mind we can now begin to see what the spirit of god is setting forth in this dietary and age here it is ahab married jezebel and he did it as a political maneuver to strengthen his kingdom and secure it that is exactly what the church did when it married under constantine they both got together for political reasons though they put a spiritual heir to it now no one can convince me that constantine was a christian he was a pagan with what looked like christian trappings he painted white crosses on the soldiers shields he was the originator of the knights of columbus he put a cross on the steeple of saint sophia's thereby starting a tradition it was constantine's idea to get everyone together the pagans nominal christians and true christians and for a while it looked as if he would succeed for the real believers came along to see if they could bring back the ones that had drifted away from the word when they saw that they couldn't bring them back into the truth they were forced to break away from the body political then when they did they were called heretics and persecuted let me say right here that we have the very same thing going on right now the people are all coming together they are writing a bible that will suit everyone whether it be a jew catholic or protestant they have their own nicene council but they call it the ecumenical council and do you know whom all these organizations fight they fight the true pentecostals i don't mean the organization called pentecostal i mean the ones who are pentecostal because they are filled with the holy ghost and have the signs and gifts in their midst because they walk in truth when ahab married jezebel for political reasons he sold his birthright you join up with an organization and you sell your birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their birthright and when you sell your birthright you're just like esau you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there is only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of her sins now if you don't think i am right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of god ever had revival and came back after she went into organization and became a denomination read your histories you can't find one not even one it was the midnight hour for israel when she joined with the world and left the spiritual for the political it was the midnight hour at nicea when the church did the same thing it is the midnight hour now that the churches are coming together now when they have married jezebel he allowed her to take the state money and erect two huge houses of worship of astarte and baal the one that was erected for baal was big enough for all israel to come and worship there at and when constantine and the church married he gave the church buildings and set up altars and images and organized the hierarchy that had already been shaping up when jezebel got the power of the state behind her she forced her religion on the people and killed the prophets and priests of god it got so bad that elijah the messenger to his day thought he was the only one left but god had seven thousand more that hadn't bowed the knee to baal and right now out there amongst those denominations of baptists methodists presbyterians etc there are some that will come out and come back to god i want you to know i am not now and never have been against the people it is the denomination the system of organization that i am against i have to be against it for god hates it now just let us stop a minute here and rehearse what we brought out about the worship in thyatira i said that they worshipped apollo who was the sun god along with the emperor now this apollo was called the averter of evil he turned evil away from people he blessed them and was a real god to them he was supposed to teach the people he explained about worship and temple rights services to gods about sacrifices and death and life after death the way he did this was through a prophetess who sat entranced upon a tripod chair my do you see it here is that prophetess called jezebel and she is teaching the people and her teaching is seducing the servants of god and causing them to commit fornication now fornication means idol worship that is what its spiritual meaning is it is an illegal union ahab's union and constantine's union were both illegal both committed spiritual fornication every fornicator will wind up in the lake of fire god said so now you did not follow that what is your fortification what is that okay it is instead of the word of god that is very true that is spiritual for education an illegal union where the church united in the wrong way you know like he's showing you that i was the king yeah yes i went into a wrong union uh with a jezebel and jezebel caused the people to commit spiritual fornication by killing all the prophets of god and bringing the foreign gods of the rest from his people and from heart from our people from the people that where she came from and we also find that the same thing that uh constantine did constantine was an emperor an emperor in rome you remember in a pegamon he called a the he convinced a council called the city council and in the silicon so emperor constantine was able to gather the people together bring them together and uh cause them to believe in the one god one world ago and that kind of union was was spiritual fornication because they left the way of god and they went into the way of man because sooner or later of course we see that in this particular church age where the man speaks of this foe that uh rose up and at this time you know he said well he is the one who is the vicar of christ he actually talked about him what's the name of that pope if you've been following has someone noted that somewhere yes which pen is that two to five okay what what does it say okay i think uh you can look at it from uh two to four way where he says that uh now as we have already said this age is called the dark ages because it was indeed a darkest period of all history all right and then he says that it was the age of the pope uh who claimed that he was the vicar of christ macaulay is fairly gay so-called supreme suffering over the church and the world who instituted the inquisition which under his direction shed more blood than at any other time except in the reformation it was the age of the prophecy the rule of alex sargarius the third had a mysteries and filled the purple choir with the paramores and bastard sons and turned the purple palace into a dead robot and actually much later on you know of course it became a team of robbers that uh martin luther himself does speak about it actually i have a a little bit a few books of mathematica here a few letters that matter wrote to uh for player okay much later on after the uh this pop uh what's the name of the sport you know probably okay much later but also uh you know in the same way they were not different they were not different at all and i i want to see if i can be able to get some of these books here that i have and i read for you some of the letters that uh martin luther wrote and he sent to pope leo you know matt luna was uh the messenger that comes as a fifth church eight messenger you know what's the fifth church age called what is it [Music] is can someone tell me something oh after this after they said i'm going to ask serious questions serious questions yes felt very sick is that true who says it is true [Music] so some of you don't even know whether it is true or not and your business having this together guys so where have you been do you have your first exams in glass don't you this is a study you read that but you have been reading here seriously okay can someone tell you something about martin and who was wanted to begin with brother is [Music] [Music] [Music] they get [Music] you he could not try to avoid him anymore yes such men of god who have the power of god moving in them hallelujah that's the kind of man we are looking up to you know even in this house where are those men and women that will remove the heart of god hallelujah amen even when your enemy is against you and you need to talk to them and they try to lock their doors in those doors amen all right and then again now we see here i wanted to share something with you that is really very very special special uh the letters one of the letters of uh rudolph maturuta was the age of messenger that comes much later in the uh in the church so we see that in in studies god continues we see that the things are really starting down here in that era when when uh innocent that poor the third the pop of rome at that time you know he kind of advances here he feel the purple choir these sagaris the third the purple choir with barometers and powerful sons and turn their palace a paper palace into a hell of robots but we see even the catholic church itself did not become the way it were it is today immediately nothing went on windowing by little small by small over the years so by the time of martin luther they were decaying rotten rotted okay rotten initially they thought they were doing something for the lord but of course the way inspired by the devil that's why we always have to look out for things which seem to be wrong as much as the people might have the right or the best of intentions you may have the best of an injection that's organized let's do something else is god in that way it's not moving you that way is it in the word of god or is it uh your desire you might have the best intentions to suffer but if something is anti-war then it is that the christ yes so these people organized and he was under the word what they were doing to put a man there to lead the whole church to the satisfaction of christ and by the way they only organized the bishops which were the two bishops they lost their organized and of course the others rejected that idea but others continue with that idea and of course the ones which rejected the idea we read of them here how he is talking about their works those believers but we see in this age there are those that and once the prophecy was formed then there is one man who is speaking on behalf of god apparently imagine one might speak on behalf of god everybody else has to listen of christ this is what it means to be the league of press the vicar is instead of his day twice he is there a sister is the vice president he is the next in command you understand when the other is not around you will you finish up everything so in other words he made and he called himself the device of christ the assistant of christ what a blessed feeling and i want you to see what this man is saying who was a priest in this very system much later on of course he was raised in that system and he became a priest but here are some of these words there are very many words that he speaks but uh i'll wait for you just a little bit i have a very big book here okay says i don't even know i don't i don't even know what to begin to begin from but let me begin even though a miracle were to be done in the pope's behalf against the temple powers or though someone were mistreated with a blade which they must have sometimes happened it should be considered only the work of the devil because of the weakness of faith of our faith in god he is a priest psychotherapist writing today before writing to apollo and he's telling him there is no miracles there is no power of god here even if america was gonna happen it is done by them because of the weakness of our faith in god christ himself prophesied in matthew there shall come in my name first christ and first prophets and blue citizens and so this is the better here and paul says in the second thessalonians the truth that articles through the power of saturn being mighty in lying wonders there instead of hold first to this no christian authority can do anything against christ as saint paul says we can do that against christ but for christ whatever that's called against christ is the power of antichrist and of the devil and even though it were to reign and again one doesn't play one thousand plagues broke nothing especially in these last evil times through which all the scriptures prophesy first wonders therefore we must live with the firm faith to the words of god and then the devil sees from the from wonders can you imagine that this is a man that actually was a was able to preach his faith his message was the gesture live so when i read these messages oh he's late i'm actually reading the message because this is one of the messengers of the chat agent and actually if you really want to understand faith read the words of the leaders of the the the preachings of muslim rule you can fight for the internet find it read it he faith in christ faith in christ that was the revelation of the hour not in the church but in christ i wait for you to do more thus i hope he's writing to the top remember i hope that the fourth line terror with which the romans have this long time made our course just timid and stupid has been elected they like all of us are subject to the temple sword they have no power to interpret the scriptures by mere authority without learning they have no authority to prevent a cancer or a sheer woundedness to pledge it and bind it or take away slavery but if they do this they are in the truth of the communion of the antichrist and the devil and have nothing at all of course except the name and then he continues on our views to be discussing consciousness we shall now look at the matters which should be discussed in the councils and we wish popes cardinals bishops and all the scholars ought properly to be occupied day and night if they love christ and his church but if they neglect this duty then let the lighting the people the believers he was a german remember and fear god brothers and men that we may not share the faith of all the people so of the other apostles who are solamentably lordship through the shameful and involved rules grow is meaning that the rule that the rule of pop of wrong the rule of uh of wrong was hell bound health taking people to hell and he's saying it cannot grow but meaning it has already seen highest level of the u.s and this was a priest in this system i think that he can never conceive no not believe and then he says it is a horrible and frightful thing that the ruler of the christendom who boasts himself as the vicar of christ and successor of saint peter lives in such a worldly splendor in his regard no king no ever can people or approach him and that he who claims the title of most horror and my spiritual is more worldly than the world itself he wears a triple crown when the greatest kings wear about a single crown if that is a likely property of christ and of saved peter then it is a if if that is like the prophet of christ and of saint peter then it is a new kind of likeness when a word is saved against it they cry out jealousy meaning when you say something against the catholic church they will say it is a harass that man is healthy let us back him so when i was they said i guess you're saying whatever they cry out firstly but that is because they do not wish to hear how unchristian and how ungodly such a practice is oh man talk about a man who is standing for god faith in christ i think however that if the pope were with the king with the tears to pray to god killing the pope doesn't even have he's not even halfway up he has the prayer of god i'm telling you this man whoever you have never heard of them i think however that if the pope were with the three has to pray to god he would have to lay aside these crowns for our god can suffer no praying and using office is nothing else at least they need to week and pray for christendom meaning the office of the prophet should be over such a man who says that is on behalf of god on god of christ his office should be there to always cry for the sins of the people right before god right like jesus was doing right but he's saying he if he would do that if he hadn't even idea to play fast he would have to first put down his triple crown he had a one of the with with his people you know a triple crown with three this is a man who there are many many words he spoke here i wish i had the time to read for that review there more and he spoke very very interesting things and uh i really always find it uh quite uh quite amazing the way he uh relays these words uh all right let me read for you this for my part i will openly confess that i know i have only good and vulnerable things of thee whenever i have made mention of thy name meaning problem and if i have done otherwise i myself meaning meaningless by no means approve of it but would entirely approve the judgment others are fond of me and do nothing more gladly than we can't search russians and the empire children on my part i have but i'm saying that this man was considered to be the messenger and so not because he was able to stand for the truth but he was also able to stop to be sober among us the fanatics you know they found that he's the ones who went overboard with what he was teaching you can hear you can see how he's disclaiming that some people were writing things and doing things which he never told them to do apparently but i hate to talk about the pope and the roman reigns itself by this by thy sea which is called the roman career and which neither thou nor any man can deny that it is more corrupt than any babylon or sodom ever was and which is as far as i can see characterized by our totally brave hopeless and notorious weekends he's writing to the pope and he's a priest and by this side they were but they were buying them with fight but for him he's not he's not feeling what they will do to him let's see i have truly despised that see i appreciate and i have been in sense to think that in my thy name and under the guise of the roman church the people of christ are mocked and so i am resisting and will resist that seed meaning the vatican as long as the spirit of faith shall believe in me hallelujah how may i really resist the anti-christ doctrine as long as the spirit of faith lives in you hallelujah you know that's what we ought to do there are many many things here that i can read for you but let us now go to the message of our day amen i can see we have a few more minutes left you can make use the teaching of the catholic church the church is female it is a woman denies the word of god the pope who is literally apollo in a modern version has taught the people to join themselves to idols the roman church has now become a false prophetess to the people because she has taken away the word of the lord from the people and given her own ideas as to what constitutes forgiveness of sins what brings the blessings of god and the priests have gone so far as to stay categorically but they have power not only in life but in death they teach on their own that there is a purgatory but you can't find that in the word they teach that prayers and masses and money will get you out of purgatory and into heaven the whole system that is based upon its teaching is false it does not lie on the sure foundation of the revelation of god in his word but lies on the shifting sinking sands of its own diabolical untruths the church went right from organization to denomination and hence to false teaching that is right the roman catholics don't believe that god is in his word no sir if they did they would have to repent and back up but they say god is in his church that would make the bible the history of the catholic church that isn't so look what they did to water baptism alone they took it away from being christian baptism and made it a pagan one of titles let me tell you about an experience i had with a catholic priest a girl that i had baptized at one time turned catholic so the priest wanted to interview me about her he asked what kind of baptism she had i told him i baptized her in christian baptism which is the only kind there was to my knowledge i had buried her in water in the name of the lord jesus christ the priest remarked to me that at one time the catholic church did that right away i asked him when the catholic church did that for i have read their histories and i could not find what he said he told me that it was found in the bible and that jesus had organized the catholic church i asked him if he thought peter was really the first pope he emphatically said that peter was i asked him if the masses were said in latin in order to ensure that they were correct and would never change he said that was true i told him that i thought they had wandered a long way from what they had in the beginning i let him know that if the catholic church really believed the book of acts then i was an old-fashioned catholic he told me that the bible was the record of the catholic church and that god was in the church i disagreed with him for god is in his word let god be true but every man a liar if you take away or add to that book god has promised that he will add plagues to those who add and take away their part from the book of life if they dare to subtract from it revelation 22 18-19 let me just show how the roman catholic church believes that god is in the church instead of the word here is an excerpt from the diary of pope john the twenty third my experience during these three years as pope since in fear and trembling i accepted this service in pure obedience to the lord's will conveyed to me through the sacred college of cardinals and conclave bears witness to this maxim and is a moving and lasting reason for me to be true to it absolute trust in god in all that concerns the present and perfect tranquility as regards the future this pope states that god spoke through the church revealing his will how false god is in his word and speaks by the word revealing his will he also stated that he placed absolute trust in the word of men and thereby obeyed it with tranquility it sounds so beautiful but it is so false just like the perversion in the garden of eden now let us get over here in revelation 17 and see this woman the church who was living on false prophecies and not the word of god in verse one god calls her the great why is she a because she is in idolatry she has caught the people up into the same thing what's the cure for idolatry the word of god so this woman is a because she has left the word there she is sitting upon many waters which means multitudes of people this surely has to be the false church because the church of god is small few there be that find it notice what she is like in the eyes of god no matter how wonderful she looks to people and how philosophical she sounds she is filthy drunk on her fornications now she was drunk with the blood of the martyrs just like jezebel who killed the prophets and priests and destroyed the people of god who would not bow down and worship baal and that is exactly what the catholic church did they killed those that would not bow down to the popish rule those who wanted the word of god instead of the words of men were put to death usually by cruel methods but this church that dealt in death was dead herself and didn't know it there was no life in her and no signs ever followed her space to repent revelation 2 21 and i gave her space to repent of her fornications and she repented not do you know that this church was actually more wicked than ahab do you know that he repented for a while and walked softly before god you can't say that of the roman catholic church no sir she has never repented but has stubbornly destroyed any and all who tried to help her repent that is history now god kept raising up not only the messengers to each age but he raised up some wonderful helpers for those messengers he gave every age some wonderful men of god and they did everything they could to bring the church back to god god certainly gave her opportunity and helped to repent did she ever repent and show she did by her fruits no sir she never has and she never will she is drunk she has lost her senses in spiritual things now don't be confused and start thinking that the church of rome has repented of her slaughter of the saints because she is attempting to unite with the protestants by making her creeds to line up with protestant creeds not once has she ever apologized and said she was wrong for her mass murders and she won't either and no matter how mellow and sweet she appears at this particular time she will yet rise up to kill for murder lies in her evil and unrepentant heart sentence against the harlot past revelation 2 22-23 behold i will cast her into a bed and them that commit adultery with her into great tribulation except they repent of their deeds and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works what this woman has children and she a if that is the case that she had children by her whoredoms then she must be burnt with fire as the word has said that is exactly true that is her end for she will burn with fire her end is the lake of fire but stop and think about these children for a moment a woman is the one out of whom the children come it is evident that this woman had children that came out of her but they did the same thing she did show me one church that ever came out of organization that didn't go right back into it there isn't one not one the lutherans came out and then organized right back and today they are hand in glove with this ecumenical move the methodists came out and they organized right back the pentecostals came out and they organized right back there is going to be another coming out and praise god they won't organize back because they know the truth that group will be the bride of the last day now it said here that this had children now what were they they were daughters for they were churches just like her now here is a very interesting point jezebel and ahab had a daughter that daughter married jehoram the son of jehoshaphat and in second kings 8 16 it says that jehoram walked in the ways of his father-in-law he went right into idolatry by this marriage he brought god fearing and god worshiping judah into idolatry that is exactly what all these daughter churches have done even as i have pointed out to you they start in the truth and marry into organization and leave the word for tradition creeds etc now let me get this across in hebrews 13 7 it says obey them which have rule over you who have spoken to you the word of god it is the word that rules us not men now a man as a husband is head of the woman he rules her but the church is a woman too and her ruler is the word jesus is the word if she rejects the word and takes any other headship she is an adulteress now you name me one church that hasn't given up the word for traditions and creeds they are all adulterouses like mother like daughter what will be the punishment of the harlot and her children well it is going to be twofold first he said i will cast her into a bed according to the last part of verse 22 it will be a bed of tribulation or the great tribulation that is exactly what jesus said in matthew 25 1-13 there were ten virgins five were wise and five were foolish the five wise had oil the holy spirit but the other five did not when the cry went up behold the bridegroom cometh the five foolish had to run seeking oil while the five wise virgins went into the marriage the five that remained outside were left to the great tribulation that is what will happen to all who do not go up in the rapture that is what will come upon the harlot and her daughters secondly it says that he will kill them with death or as a literal translation says let them be put to death with death this is a strange saying we might say let a man be put to death by hanging or by electrocution or some other way but this says let them be put to death by death death itself is the cause of their death now i want you to see this clearly so i will take our illustration again of the daughter of jezebel marrying into the house of judah and thereby bringing it right into idolatry and causing god to deliver judah to death that is what balaam did too so here was jezebel with her paganism over there is judah properly worshiping god and living under the word so jezebel marries her daughter to jehoram the minute that happens jehoram causes the people to become idolaters the minute that marriage took place judah was dead spiritual death came in the minute the first church of rome organized it died the minute that the lutherans organized death came in and they died the pentecostals came along last and they organized the spirit left though they don't believe it but he did that marriage brought death then the light of oneness of the godhead came they organized and they died too then after the fire of god fell on the ohio river in 1933 a healing revival swept the world but it never came through any organization god went outside the pentecostal groups outside of organization and what he is going to do in the future is going to be outside organization too god can't work through the dead he can only work through the living members those living members are outside of babylon so you see death or organization came and the church died or to make it plainer death became a resident wherein shortly before only life reigned as the original eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corrupters nicolaitanism propagated by the prophetess jezebel now eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed but adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene and she will be burned with her seducer for the and her children and the antichrist and satan will all find their places in the lake of fire right here i will be getting ahead of myself and maybe i ought to reserve this for the message on the last age but it seems just right to put it in now because it deals so clearly with organization and what is going to happen through it and i want to warn you revelation 13 1-18 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worship the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against god to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle and them that dwell in heaven and it was given unto him to make war with the saints and to overcome them and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and nations and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him whose names are not written in the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world if any man have an ear let him hear he that bleedeth into captivity shall go into captivity he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword here is the patience and the faith of the saints and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him and causeth the earth and them which dwelt therein to worship the first beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men and he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by a sword and did live and he had power to give life under the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and caused that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he causeth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundred threescore and six this chapter shows the power of the roman catholic church and what she will do through organization remember this is the false vine let it name the name of the lord it does so only in a lie its headship is not of the lord but of satan it finally ends up completely identified with the beast the riding on the scarlet beast distinctly shows her power is the god of force satan and not our god the lord jesus christ in verse 17 it emphatically shows that she will gain absolute control of the commerce of the earth for no man can buy or sell apart from her this is born out in revelation 18 9-17 which shows her involvement with kings princes merchants all of whom have to do with rome and commerce in revelation 13 14 we learned that the beast spreads his influence through the image which was built for him the image that is made is a worldwide ecumenical council wherein all the organized churches will get together with the roman catholics they are doing it even now it is quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of communism but since communism like nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to burn the flesh of the harlot rome will be overcome and destroyed take note that everywhere the romish church went communism followed it has to be that way and let me warn you now don't get thinking communism is your only enemy no sir it is the catholic church also and even more so now let us read revelation 13 1-4 and compare this with revelation 12 1-5 revelation 13 1-4 and i stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the beast which i saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority and i saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wandered after the beast and they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast and they worshiped the beast saying who is like unto the beast who is able to make war with him revelation 12 1-5 and there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pain to be delivered and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and it cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born and she brought forth a man-child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up unto god and to his throne satan and his satanic religion are in both of these beasts in revelation 14 the beast that was wounded unto death but lived again is imperial pagan rome that fell to the onslaught of the barbarians and thereby lost her temporal power but she regained it in papal rome do you see it the nation that ruled by crushing all in which became the strongest empire ever known was finally wounded to death her power was gone physically as to control by armies etc but under constantine she came back to life for papal rome has infiltrated the whole world and her power is absolute she uses kings and merchants and in her deadly religious and financial strength she is governing as the goddess of this present age she is also the dragon that stood waiting to devour the man-child herod tried to kill the lord jesus and failed later jesus was crucified by roman soldiers but now is caught up to the throne where he says that of course in revelation where he's fixed of the dragon who will be fought to devour the man child and then the mother ran into the desert and all that so that can be looked at both spiritually and also physically tried to kill the lord jesus and faith later yes was specified by the roman soldiers but now he's caught up to the throne so we see that it already happened physically but also it is going to happen spiritually okay the therefore that same beast that same uh god the dragon of the world of the world the dragon wants to do far to be rather manchester remember you remember when when paul was going and uh and uh the the the voice of the lord believed uh that paul why do you persecute me he said that how am i prosecuted he don't even know how he persecuted him but he was appealing him by prosecuting the church so the judge of jesus christ is that man child you know and and the devil would want to to still attack and devour that same christ in us you see at this how but like like like jesus was able to overcome like he was able to die and rise again in the same way today in our generation in this generation that we are going to contend with this same power electrical actually already containing recent problems in many many ways in many many ways but we know that its power is going to come into full force during the tribulation who will be here to see that raise up your hand well i hope no one will be here to see that because in the tribulation we will not be here i will not be here to say that hallelujah because i know that the chariot is coming and i i and and i'll go i'll go away i i will not be here i'll fly away all right that's what i'm waiting for i'm waiting for the challenge and i'm waiting for the chariot to swing glory [Music] [Applause] well i want to be in that number when the saints go marching in i'm waiting for that cherry the stream low and i'll step in but we know that this this system this dragon is the same as um the dragon that was is same she is also the drummer that's true waiting to divide in manchester but we know that the devil comes in many ways of course he used wrong but he also uses many other things but we noticed that when he talked about uh wrong uh up there he says that uh there was there was an image made like after the beast and he said what's that image someone who was following me on to see who would follow the reading what was that image come on now what was the image which was made like under the the beast so sorry again the ecumenical council some people miss that i want to see if i can get it up here now i thought that you're following and i don't need to explain every line every bus okay uh where is it are we right here is it up or if i let it down okay down here it talks about the ecumenical cancer um how it was um that power that raises up as the image like unto the beast and uh we talk about people who are going to persecute the the freak body you think it's going to be the catholic church it's going to be this very image which is like after the district castle they're all they are coming together those denominations they're all coming together thinking they're coming together for a good cause but we have found out they are the daughter of this house because this hallow had a watch our children had daughters and these daughters were like andra oh i used and i stood up upon the sand and and the sea and so the beast raised up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns still grounds and upon his heads they never blasted and the piece which i saw was like onto a notepad and his feet were like the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the drama gave him power gave him his power and his seats are in great authority and i saw one of his great pains as doing one day today and if that the wound was huge yes it's quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of colleges but since communism like nebuchadnezzar has been raised up to ban the pleasure of the others wrong will be overcome and destroyed take note that that everywhere the rummage will charge went uh you don't know what i'm looking for down all right okay yes okay the image is made is our is made that is made is a wild way ecumenical you know today to be in an organization or part of it is almost to be dead and i'm when they organize they die when you listen to the church i don't know how many are listening to the message how many listen to the message of your hand okay you don't usually listen to the message to listen to it is it's good let me tell you whenever i listen to my message i feel refreshed and by the bottom says you like saying that when they organize they die whenever they organize they died so that's why we are not an organization that's why we are not a denomination hallelujah where of course to be organized does not mean that we should be disorganized because we are not organized he is saying when they nominate okay where you know they organize the chapters you see that again there will go again together with the roman catholics they have already the last group to join them has done it about three years ago they pentecostals don't change the same roman catholic system of course they are not gendered roman catholic church but they have come in connection and in agreement with them by so doing they have joined this image that is it is quite possible this union will come in order to stop the power of the comments well that unit has already come and i'm telling you that's the greatest threat that is there to the believer and we found out the only way they can survive it to do what who that is the only way they can survive the wrath of god is to come out of hawaii people be not partakers of our sin some of you who are born in what you're the messiah you know what it means brother you you'll understand oh you're also going to miss it you you're not going to listen yes so you understand what i'm talking about you'll see i
