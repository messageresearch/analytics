you are ready for our bible study tonight yes so uh i just uh wanted to say i appreciate the the brothers that uh have been uh at the church praying and then and then sharing the word i think about the mafia indeed share the word today uh that was quite impressive i i did not hear that listen to the role of it but i listen to a question i will complete it uh but i think if people need to start me studying for us sir this is really good so have been missing those meetings please go there go there uh when when you usually meet brother on friday yeah it is not streamed at all but uh so those who want to be a part of it on friday what time nine a.m yeah nine a.m up to what time what when is the sharing 11 11 a.m in the morning and then you are they're always there praying and and uh trying to avoid food so that they can be in the presence of god and they pray and they wait upon god and they share the word encourage one another that's really good so only that those who want to be a part of it you have to let me know what they said but they don't know don't just go because the chances are not yet open so we don't want to have everybody going and then we have issues uh later on so we don't want to have that if you want to go and be a part of it let us know so we can be sure to include you on the list to know that you are going to go so that you can see how to do it but i want to appreciate you brothers who have been making that happen and praying and also i believe you pray for this program that's usually very very good you know this without prayer cannot get us anywhere and

unfortunate do you do you know the reason um at this time so well like i said i'm happy if two people come here when they are in for reach where they are brave i'm beginning to think that those ones

you are part of this discussion we will always start with you and have you talk and have you tell us where you have reached and tell us what you have read if you are not reading then maybe also resume your escape and then you will go to the youtube and then maybe if you are there and then you get more then you disappear completely the purpose is not to chase you out but the purpose is to really have you be serious if you're serious for this we want you to be a part of this but if you do not want to be a part of it we don't want to force you we don't want to force anybody to be a part of this please put that off so uh since i uh i want to begin with those who are online please can you ensure that it works out because we cannot hear what you're saying and we want to hear you where you have

qualifies hallelujah yeah so uh can i now have it brother yes okay who is who is going to be my leading angel okay reads start reading right now salutation revelation 2 verse 8. you see these things say the lord says the first and the last which was dead and is alive the first and the last witch was dead and is alive now these are not the words of a man a mere man could he speak from the grave would say i am the first and the last which was alive and is dead the first thing that happens to a man is that he's born he's alive and the last thing that happens is that he dies so this is not a man speaking this is deity man adam took life and turned it into death but this man jesus took death and turned it and turned it into life adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste holding a waste holy wilderness but this one is coming back to turn and earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert in the spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin more decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that was within the souls of men but this one from all that tragic death and degradation that filled mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that as sin once reigned unto death even so might men now reign in righteousness the one christ jesus and not as the offence was not terrible indeed it was but now much more is his gift and to eternal life and here and here he is walking in the midst of those whom he has redeemed even his church and what were those who are redeemed were not many like paul mothers and corrupters or not many like the dying thief rather than main killers all trophies of his grace all brought back from the dead all made alive in christ jesus the lord i wonder if you noted the salutation to the first edge and they noted that i want to this age just put them together these things say three that holds the seven stars in the in his right hand and walks in the midst of the churches these things say the first and the last which was dead and is alive this is one and the same person and he is letting us know that the church is his as the seed of the fruit is in the midst of the fruit so is he the royal seed in the midst of the church and the seed as the seed alone has life in it so is he the author of life to the church his working signifies his and tearing care of it he is the chief shepherd watching over his own that is his right for he bought that church with his own blood that blood is the blood of god the one who owns that church is good very good he is the first and the last that title spills eternity he was dead and is alive he paid the price so he has sold ownership of the temp of gold he rules it he's worshiping it he resents anyone taking over his lordship and authority no doubt the reason he introduces himself to each age as deity is to warn and confront the people he wants the false wife and he confronts the truth this is the one to almighty god live amen now three things or four things that i really wanted to look at and if there's anyone who also has a question or something you want to discuss from this you feel free now in the first part or the opening part there he says would i would um say i am the first and the last which was alive and his dead the first thing that happens to a man is that he is born and the last thing that happens to him is he does what he dies so he says this is not a man that is speaking yes because for him he's speaking reverse i was there and now i'm alive so meaning for him and before remember before he died he was alive he was alive he died and he's alive so in other words he is more than man this is deed speaking this is not the man you know like you and me but his god himself was dead and is alive he's speaking of jesus christ then he begins he brings another point here of the man jesus and the man adam he says that adam took a paradise and turned it into a wasting holding wilderness but this one is coming back to a time and earth rocking and reading with the destruction into another eden adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that was within the souls of men until today but he says but this one from all the tragic death and degradation that filled mankind brought forth a life of righteousness and beauty so that has seen once reigned unto death even so my men now reign in righteousness by one that is christ jesus and not as the offense was look you need to understand one thing here that the bible calls jesus the second adam did you know that and it also calls jesus rather adam the one of genesis according to the first adam so in one one person one day ask me so you mean that jesus is your brother in one sense yes jesus is my brother jesus is our brother but also he is more than a brother he is our goal did you know we sing a song that is everything to me yes do you check if you see from that song there it's a very very good chorus just put everything perhaps you'll get it you know jesus is he's a doctor he's a friend he's a father he's a mother a brother he's a sister he's god he's a teacher is the husband your husband don't call him your wife that's the only thing he is not what else [Music] is he's a keeper he's a protector he's a friend he's a counselor he is the provider yes jehovah jireh what else here people speak what he is to you or what he has ever been to you is the truth he's the life come on he is our salvation he said you is what he is your food yes it's my food is your deliverer promiscuity he's a promise keeper yes he's a breathing is everything to me is everything is everything to me he's my father my mother my sister and my brother is a to me come on sing it again oh is everything is everything to me is everything is everything to me oh he's my father my mother my sister and my brother is everything to me you want to try it when you are clapping your hands his everything is everything to me he's everything is everything to me oh he's is is everything to me oh he's everything is everything to me mine is my my oh my mother my jesus is everything to me and here we know that he is also our brother as a second adam he is our brother you know there was a law in the old testament and that was the law of um the kinsmen redeemer you know when when you lost your property your kinsman was the one supposed to redeem everything or when if you died also in this in the case like the case of uh of what was his name is it an admiration the husband of naomi you know his brother was the one supposed to redeem he's a kids man he's next of kin you know when you open up they ask who is the next of kin the next of kin is like your kinsman but what happened is that the king's man that was the kingsman of elementary refused when he heard about ruth but somehow there is another one who was in the next line the next of kin after him and that was born for him he accepted to redeem hallelujah now if you have not if you don't know what i'm talking about read the book of rules it will be a blessing now also there is another one to us who is our next of kin our next of kin is not your mother your father your brother your sister your friend your relatives our next of kin do you have the word king kin means blood relative he must be from with the same lineage like you he must be born in the same way you are born now who was our first one who were we at first we were adam but we sinned adam sinned and when he said he wasn't supposed no one else can redeem him but he's next of kin even an angel could not that's why we sing a song that even the angels cannot sing angels don't know any song about redemption because angels have never been redeemed angels have sinned before but angels cannot be redeemed when they sinned it was done for them but for us in adam when we sinned god decided because remember god adam was a spoken word of god and adam was a son of god because it was a spoken word of god so there was no one to die for adam or to do to be there for to die for him the only person that can be able to die for him is his blood brother but do you know who your blood brother is what does it mean billy paul when i say your blood breath what does it mean yes same parent you are you you are fathered by the same father so adam had to have his blood brother to be able to die for him are you following me yes but did the adam have a blood brother i'd have never had a blood brother right so what could god do because remember adam was a part of god and adam did not have a blood brother and yet god wanted to be a redeemer he wanted to to be called a redeemer he had that attribute within him and he wanted that attribute to be made manifest and in order for that to happen i will tell you what god did right here okay yo um but i'm going to ask you for scripture now in corinthians i believe it is hallelujah okay first corinthians chapter 15. versus a it's a it is it's all a good chapter but you can begin just read for the 4 45. just give me those ones there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body and so it is written the first man adam was made a living soul the last adam was made a quickening spirit have you got it brother chapter 15 yes yeah 45 how bait that was not fast which is spiritual but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual the first man is of the earth i love verse 46 which says that uh fast that which is natural just like you were born as a natural being but then you must also be born spiritually first you were born physically like adam now you must be born spiritually you must be born of the spirit at first you were born carnally like in the flesh but now you must be born again but also adam was created first then that was the first man he was natural and then comes the spiritual man which was jesus the second adam are you following okay excuse me verse 47 the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the lord from that's a very good one for the people who doubt that jesus is god the first man was of the earth athe the second man is the lord from heaven not the second person of the trinity but the lord from heaven now there is your second adam the first adam was adam who sinned and then the second adam is jesus christ himself now here is my point jesus was a second second second adam you what is your name what is your full name what is your name that's your full name my friend yes all right what is your name brother say that again loudly all right somewhere the same thing right because you do you know what it means it means you are a son of a peru you also it means your son or you you come from the same root yes you know so to say that jesus is the second adam and the other was the first adam is to mean they all come from the same root they all come from the same origin they all share the same blood adam the first one was a manifestation of uh an attribute of god can i also say that jesus was also a manifestation of the attribute of god yes i can say that because jesus is at uh an attribute of god manifested because god in him he wanted to be a savior to be a savior he had to manifest his attribute as a son are you following me so we now see jesus being the second adam it means he was a brother of adam for him to be a brother of adam it remains according to the law of the kinsman redeemer the law of salvation it remains that the second man adam that is jesus now qualified to be able to save his brother adam hallelujah so which means jesus was not only a kinis man but he was a kinisman redeemer meaning he was qualifying to redeem he redeemed and he was qualifying just like that man went that boaz he went on a gate he removed his shoe he put it up he said to everybody you see let this be a testament or testimony today that i have decided to redeem all that which was eddie manages and also a take now on me here and i've bought her to be i mean not now me but ruth and i've bought her to be my wife jesus did the same thing amen when he went on the cross hallelujah he was lifted up and he said everybody see me that was a testament a testimony he was leaving behind i have decided today to redeem all that which was my brothers and also take karemua and also take part and also pray whoever you are another day son so to be my wife hallelujah that is how and why he becomes both our brother and wife and husband rather he becomes both our brother and our husband how come because he was wearing all the shoes at first for him oh hallelujah feel so nice for him in order to save us he had to take off the shoes of a father he had to take off the shoes of of god he took it off he said that oh in philippians he says for god amen let this mind be in you which was also in the philippians 2 which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robert to be equal with the god but he took upon himself the form of a man being found in a fashion as a man or as a servant he took upon himself the death even the death of the cross because he was found in a fashion as a servant as a man you understand he took off the shoes from him of being god the father so that he can be able to wear the shoes of our brother that's why he can be our brother and also he can be our god hallelujah so friends that's why here we now go back to our church edge book brother he says that this first man adam took a world which was so beautiful and he turned it in wasted it you know he brought what did he bring he mentions those things that are down there adam took a paradise and turned it into a west holding wilderness but this one is coming back to an earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another aiden friends we are going into another aiden hallelujah adam took a life of fellowship and joy with god and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion delusion the delusions of the world the the the delusive dream of the world the devil took it rather the devil has turned this world into that by this fallen adam by this fallen adam it is people who are creating the world i mean making the world be the way it is now they're talking of global warming they're talking of many things that are going wrong earthquakes and stuff like that guns it is caused by what by man um so corruption and everything but this second adam is coming and for him he is going to turn it righteous he's going to turn everything into the right way hallelujah that's the one we are waiting for hallelujah okay go down there at the beat he says and here he is working in the midst of those whom he has redeemed even his church and what where are those who were redeemed we are not many like paul mothers and corrupters where we also don't like those things yes we are not many like the dying thief robbers and men killers all trophies of his grace and all brought back from the dead all made alive in christ jesus the lord hallelujah i wonder if you're not at the salutation of the first age and they're not not the one to this age just put them together he said okay these things he says the first and the last which was and is and which was dead and is alive this one and the same person this one this sorry this is one and the same person and uh he is letting us know that the church is that the church is his and then one last thing here in the last paragraph which he says he is the chief shepherd watching over his own that is his right it is the right of jesus to watch over you don't ever at any time refuse his lordship over you it is the right it is his right to watch over you huh you people you are not getting it it is right it is jesus's right to watch over you it is his right to tell you stop that it is his right to do that it is right it is his right meaning he must do it if you are his own if you matter your wife it is your right to tell her what you want it is your right to rule over her it is you all right you got a point if i come and try to tell you what to what if i come and i try to tell your wife what to do even if i'm your pastor you will dismiss me immediately why because it is you are right amen to subdue her it is your right to rule over it is your right to tell her what to do it is your right as a husband therefore if the church is the church of jesus christ if you are a member of that church it is jesus's right to lead your life therefore you don't have any rights you do not have any rights all the rights are easy patent right it is a he is a copy he has a copyright on those rights no man even if they are pastors bishops parents friends they have no right to tell you to disobey christ yes it is his singular right to watch over he has a right over that church for he has bought that church with his own blood hallelujah if you go to a market huh yes sister is that pain in yours are you sure that pain is yours why are you saying it is yours you bought it now what if someone comes and claims ownership over that pain you let them have a habit if you have another option but now you have another option so what would you do you tell them you are using it if they say ah give me what you do why would you do that because it is your yes you got a point yes it is you are right sometimes when i'm at the airport i meet people and uh you know sometimes when we pause for a long time you can always pause it so when uh you just click pause you know so sometimes when i'm at the airport and i meet people uh you know having pains and maybe i lost my pen or i did not i forgot to carry one and they're filling up certain things in the on the form at the airport i usually want to reach out and tell them please can you help me with your pen if someone is rude and they say no thank you there is nothing you can do whether or not you think they are not needing it and you need it there is nothing you can do they have rights over that pain because it is theirs in the same way but the panamera says that jesus bought the church with his own blood there is no pastor who has brought the church with his blood there is no pastor was bowed to you with his blood there is no church which has bowed you with his blood there is no man or woman who has bored you with his blood it is the blood of god himself is the blood of jesus christ himself and therefore what does it mean it means he has a right of ownership to you amen and he has a right over you than anyone else in the world even if it is somebody who has a right over you here in the world when it comes to jesus he supersedes all of them you see he was dead and he's alive and he paid the price for so he has soul ownership of the temple of god can you imagine you don't own yourself and also no no one nobody owns you you don't own yourself and also nobody owns you it is a christ who owns you did you ever think of that did you ever think of that that you're so important that like that did you ever think of that that you are a property a property of somebody and that somebody is not a human being that's somebody's good yes hey how should you live now how should you walk in this world how should you behave the moment you know you are not only loved by god but you are owned by him that comes with responsibility if some if you say if i said that is my car it comes with the responsibility you understand i must fuel it i must wash it i must service it i must do everything that i ought to do why because it is my cat therefore it comes with responsibility if god says he owns you it means he's responsible for you yes why then should you worry about anything in this life hallelujah that means that he owns you he is you people that's so happy right now it remains your aiming is fully responsible for your life fully i said fully he is responsible for your life fully therefore do not fear what the devil can do or whatever plans you know there were plans for each of us every day but no matter what the devil plans i know god is responsible for my life hallelujah because he owns me i do not own him he owns me hallelujah he desense anyone taking over his lordship and authority he doesn't like it no doubt the reason he introduces himself to each agent's deity is to warn and comfort the people he wants the first vine he comforts the true vine this is the one true almighty god hallelujah amen you are god from beginning to the end there's no cause for argument you are good all by yourself oh you are god from beginning to the end there's no cause for argument you are good all by yourself sing with me now oh you are god from beginning to the end there's no cause for argument you are god oh by yourself hallelujah he is all god he is god by himself he doesn't need anyone to help him be god he doesn't need anyone to help him rule therefore he is the ruler of the church he's the controller of the church hallelujah praise the name of the lord can we go to the next subtitle where is brother is happening there deity very good deity means god his deity it means he's god hallelujah the fullness of godhead the fullness everything that makes up god that's what deity means everything that makes up god is inside there he was not god minor something he was good everything that makes up god all right give us the next okay verse nine the conditions to the edge so i need someone else to read who is going to read but you're a bit faster you'll need to come a bit closer here so that people can be able to hear maybe get us get another chair you just sit a little bit closer conditions of the age relation chapter 2 verse 9 any time of sunday tribulation and poverty but thou art and i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but are the synagogues of saturn the key in this age is most evidently tribulation if there stipulation in the first age there is now predicted an intensified tribulation throughout the second age there is no doubt about what the following words of course apply to the muscle cushions [Music] hebrews chapter 10 verse 32 to 38 but court remembers the former days in which after he was eliminated he endured a great fight of afflictions partly wheels tier or made a gazing stop both by reproaches and afflictions yeah and partly with tmb became companion companions of them that were so used we had compassion of me in my bones and took the fully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourself that he have a heaven a better and unenduring substance that's not a way there are for your confidence which are great recoveries everywhere for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise create a little while and he that shall come will come and you know now they just shall live by faith but if any man grow back my my soul shall have no pleasure in him the mere association of king kind hearted people with a true believer my dream bring death in return for their kindness now the lord god almighty says i know there he is walking in the middle of his report there he is the chief shepherd of the floor but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says i know your tribulation i am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to me what is something below this is to so many people like israel they wonder if god really loves them how can god be just unloving if he stands by and watches these people suffer that is what they asked in malachi chapter 1 verse 3 verse 1-3 the burden of the word of the lord of israel by malachi i have loved you saith the lord [Music] waste for the dragons and the regulars you see they could not figure out god's love they thought that love meant no suffering he thought that love made a baby with parental care but would said that islam was elected now the proof the proof of his love is election that no matter that no matter what happened his love was proven truly by the fact that by the fact they were chosen and to salvation because god has chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he may commit you to date as he did paul may commit you to suffering as he did yoga that is his pre pre period prerogative he is suffering but it is born with a purpose if he did not have a purpose then he would be the author of frustration or not of peace his purpose is that after we have suffered a while he will be made perfect be established strengthened and settled as you've said he put strength in us chapter 23 verse 6 you see you see himself suffered he learned obedience by the things that he suffered he was actually made perfect by the things that he suffered hebrews chapter five verse eight to nine though he was a son yet learned he obedies by a thing which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey him in plain language the very character of jesus was corrected by suffering and according to paul she was made he has left his church a measure of suffering that day to by their faith in god while suffering for him would come to a place of perfection why did he want this james chapter one verse two to four my brethren count it on joy when you fall into diverse temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith working patience but let pushes have had perfect work that he may interpret an entire point in happiness and by the reason is in romans 8 verse 17-18 and his children then he has heard of god and joint prayers with christ if so be that we suffer with him that we will be also glorified together for i recall that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us unless we suffer with him we cannot train with him we have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can train because power apart from character is satanic and since he wants us to share even his throne on the on the same basis that he overcame and he sat down in his father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little temporary suffering will go through now is not what he should be compared to the tremendous glory that will be revealed in us when he comes oh what treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation make it not strange concerning a theory triangles that to try that is what peter said is each strength that god wants us to develop with christ like character that comes through suffering no sir and we all have trials we are all tried and justin as sons not one but not one but goes through uh through that the child that is not suffering and is not being trained [Music] six and estimate [Music] now the special conditioning standards must be applied to every age there is no edge for me there is no true delivery [Music] you and persecute you and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake rejoice and be exceedingly glad for what is your own one name for so persecuted by the [Music] us of history facing us as sons and how shall i prove my love to him by believing what he said and by connecting myself with joy amidst the trials that he actually is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector yet he looks at their poverty or how how [Music] meaning the believer is so-called believer but when he's not told he stumbles at this how can god bear to look upon his own in a time of nature not just so before just giving and nourish everything material upon them here is where you have to believe again in the love and goodness and wisdom of god these two is needful remember we admonished take nothing for the moral these physical things are not the true basic necessities of life for a man's life consistent with the things he possesses but rather seek here trust the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all material necessities will be added the people of god are not machiavellian they are just they are christ-minded they do not seek the treasures that are below they seek those above which is absolutely true the majority of christians are not working rather they are on the poor side because so in jesus day it was too imposed and it should an abundance of earthly goods my how richly churches and goods that have worked in spirit they said be a poor for yours is the kingdom of god the kingdom of god is not meat and drink it is not what you which is within us eventually a rich man is rich in god not in worldly things hallelujah brother you have two more paragraphs don't put down the fire oh christ the spirit i see poverty i see your needs you have it very much if anything to do so what you did you have what you didn't have has been taken from me you gladly gave us [Music] and exceeding great rewards your kingdom is yet to come but it will come and it will be an everlasting one yes i am mindful of your trials and wars i know how hard it is to get along but i will remember all this when i began to play with my own and then i will reward you now this is nothing because rich people now this is nothing against rich people because god can save a rich man you believe that some of both children are rich but money can be such a snail we are not trying to preach a gospel of being poor but yes money can be as name not to the only ones that have it but even to those who don't have it hey someone can be without money and they feel so uncomfortable that they live good and others can have so much that they feel so big and they leave god so it all calls for somebody that really loves the lord and knowing whether i have the money or i do not have the money whether i have the needs that i want or i do not have the needs praise be to the name of the lord you say in this verse here verse nine it teaches us that uh the these people suffered and yes they suffered but like they suffered we also are going to suffer amen every believer must come to this every child of god must come to this every one of us must suffer there is a portion of suffering that was left for the children of god you may say how come yes it is so because jesus you remember when he was going to the cross carrying the cross did he carry it alone there was a another man who went up to him which was indicative to the fact that even us the ones he is dying for we have to carry a bit of our cross with him we have to cut it the cross for him because of him we have a cross also to carry just like a current we also have a cross to come sometimes we may go through a period of suffering you know we don't all go through the same situations in life some may lack what to eat others may lack school fees others may lack friends i don't believe that as a child of god you should even lack friends by the way because there are many christians in the world and all those are your friends but some may not have parents some may be orphans others you know may lack many things you know in life but we know one thing that we all might go through different sufferings but we all go through the blood you know that song yes brother if you can find it for me we all have gone through certain things in life you know situation some may even suffer because of the name of jesus to be your friends can reject you and talk bad about you if you stand for christ let me tell you if this world doesn't reject you for christ it means that the world has accepted you for them you either get rejected by the world for christ and loved by god or you get loved by the world and you you'll be rejected by god you cannot have both you cannot have both and we all go each of us go through a certain degree of suffering never at any time say oh look at that one i wish i was like that one oh look at that one at least for him is like this whichever situation you are in someone else is in a one which they think is bitter than yours every christian has something they go through that becomes a problem to them that and they go through it not because they are human beings but they go through it because they are christians please don't and misunderstand this of course you every human being has the way they leave blah blah blah but many many of the things they go through in the wild is because of their choices but what i'm saying here is that the things that you suffer because of your choice to be a christian that you you you can pray but certain times certain times it might seem as if god is blocking his ears that your prayers are not being heard by god but if you're a christian you receive another attitude of believing all is well if this mountain is not moving one thing that i know that my god can move the mountain but whether or not he moves it i will still worship him whether or not the mountain moves i will still praise him hallelujah because i believe in my god i trust in my god hallelujah what's the song saying it says some through [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] but all through the blind sign through great sorrow but god gave the song green pastures so rich and so sweet god this is the children alone [Music] oh through the fire god [Applause] [Music] i oh [Music] oh god in the night season and all the day long and when the problems come when the problems come you pray you pray it doesn't go away you should just worship him you know you should sing a song which says let everything within me cry jesus because you believe it without your heart and say let everything within me cry jesus [Music] jesus [Music] jesus jesus jesus is the lamb that was you know you worship him because not because everything is okay you worship him because you believe in him and you know that he wants the best for you he'll give you the best and because you know that there is nothing you can ask him and he cannot give it to you meaning there is nothing you can ask him and he's not able to give it to you but certain times you can ask for some things and he may not give it to you he doesn't mean he has failed do you understand let us take this from verse 9 and from this portion of the smile and church to believe that believer whatever you ask god he is able to do [Music] whatever you ask god is able to do what but it doesn't mean that whatever you ask him he will do it but even when he doesn't do it you still believe he is able to do it hallelujah and that does not mean you are immune to suffering actually it only means that you may suffer because you are his property he can commit you to suffering but he doesn't do it without a purpose [Music] hallelujah do you believe that say i believe he doesn't commit you to suffering without if i believe i'm a son of god brother oh and i suffer i believe i'm suffering for a as long as i know like job the only thing job needed to do was to check his life is my life right with god we know when a problem comes to you that's the first thing you should do always check your life is my life right with god is there any sacred sin is that something is there whatever i've done or photo you cleanse yourself you say oh god i mentioned me forgive me even if sickness comes to you you know you must not get sick as a child of god yes so when it comes you go in prayer many times my wife gives a testimony when flu wanted to come to her or something wanted to come to her you know she rebukes it immediately before it comes and it goes that's right if you believe a son of god even if sickness comes you have authority over it yes do you understand you must not be sick i said you must not be sick you must not suffer are you hearing me as a son of god you're supposed to live a life of victory you must overcome your problems you must have overcome your fears [Music] are you following me now that does it doesn't mean you cannot you should you will never suffer in your life when problems come when a sickness come when troubles come when suffering comes it's like you work and then whatever you worked for is lost you put in this pocket it goes through the other pocket you need to put in this hand to go through the other hand you don't you are not ever blessed all the blessing that comes it goes you should stop a moment and go before the lord and say what is wrong search is mine search your life and then maybe you may you realize you were even a robber you were never paying your tithe because if you don't pay your tithe you cannot see the blessing of god in your life you see then when you realize that's the problem even if you pray and you don't resolve it you can never prosper therefore you have to sort that out once you sort out probably money will come and even if it comes it doesn't mean now because you saw that you're tight and everything you will not get issues still you'll get issues but when you do check yourself again are you right with god when you realize i am right with god now why did i suffer this loss i don't know but i've been right with god even this check don't immediately say i'm okay i'm right with god check yourself if maybe you you realize you are right with god and you don't see anything wrong but if you you know maybe you can't go to the pastor asking pastor you know i've been going through certain issues i don't know what is wrong with me is there something maybe the pastor the holy spirit may help him to help you realize what is going wrong in your life and then sometimes there is nothing wrong you have done if there is nothing wrong you've done and then pray and even the pastor prayed for you you will pray also for the problem to go away that's true you believe that god can is able to take out that problem always be a believer let me tell you always be a believer no matter how big the problem is always believe god can take it away whatever it is i don't care what it is always believe god can what because he has the ability when you pray believe you have received hallelujah but if you are prayed and you believe you have received and the problem remains keep believing the problem has gone hallelujah even when you see it even when the symptoms are still there keep believing the problem has gone that's the attitude of a child of god in a problem hallelujah you are hospitalized because you are sick what do you do as the child of god you check your life are you right with god yes then what is wrong you don't know then quote for the elders of the church let them come anoint you with oil and pray for you you must be healed okay you believe you must what be healed now what if you are not healed someone may say no problem there is nothing like what if as long as you apply the word you must believe that's right hallelujah but sometimes you can pray and the problem the symptoms don't go actually you're already healed because that's when god says do this and then this will happen god is not a liar is he alive there are for what he said must happen and indeed it will happen but sometimes the same terms may remain many people have died of covet 19 but not because of copy 19 but because of the symptoms of covet 19. you know when covered 19 comes in your body like me i got covered 19. but when you get covered 19 there is two things cover 19 and the symptoms of it the demon itself and the damage it causes in your body now the demon comes and it continues reproducing in your lungs and it blocks you and you're not able to breathe anymore but sometimes when that demon is is inside you and is on the throat you can even cough it out or you can drink something hot it dies or you cannot you know or you can simply pray and it dies you understand yes and then you are healed before it even goes to the lungs like it was with my case when i prayed when they prayed for me and when i prayed the demon was in me in the throat i did not know but god took it out but it had caused the damage also on my body and everything those symptoms were there but i continue to believe that i am healed i continued preaching i continued baptizing and god made sure because the demon had left no one was contacted by copper 19. are you hearing me and then the symptoms may remain there and some people die from those symptoms you see some people do it they die from the symptoms so many times i believe as a believer when you pray you believe god has done something and then you still see the symptoms you're like it has not yet happened ah believe it has happened if you prayed for healing believe healing has come if someone has prayed for you for you believe if you pray because you're poor and they pray for you believe you are rich you understand and begin working towards that begin planning talking behaving conducting yourself with the attitude of a rich man because you believe you are rich even when you do not have anything hallelujah but when you are there every time begging begging talking like someone who is defeated talking like someone who who needs it you will always remain in the in the things you confess whatever you confess you shall be if you confess you are you are defeated if you confess you are a failure if you confess that you are any problems how are you dear brother oh for us brother we have a lot of problems you will always be like that let us take something out of verse 9 of chapter 2 of revelation god looks at you sometimes and says i know what you are going through i know you have prayed for riches i know you are praying not even for riches as such but you are prayed to be well to have the needs for your needs to be provided you are praying for this to happen you are praying for this problem to go away i know you are praying i know i have already granted it to you but here is the deal i want you to still remain with those symptoms so that it can come to a point where my character is already built out from you so that i can be able to use you to do the greater things you understand so sometimes god can say like that the problem can remain the symptoms of it i mean the problem will always go out of course when you pray but now the issue is we'll go check out the symptoms brother son stand up we'll go take out the symptoms the symptoms god may take it away or god may not whether all of the symptoms go away you must believe that it has gone a believer doesn't look at the symptoms the believer looks at watch god bless you the believer looks at the promise what did god say when they pray for you you will be healed so when they pray for you you believe you are healed now if the symptoms remain keep praising god keep praising keep washing hallelujah hallelujah don't begin doubting huh if you are taking your medicine keep taking your medicine while believing you are healed remember it's not the medicine that heals this god that heals all right so if you take that medicine it will help your body boost your immunity and then uh god is able to uh to be able to create a new life because these are cells you know cells can die and other cells are born and others are dying but it is a god who is able to use all that mechanism to bring forth life in your body and you can also do it without even medicine at all it all depends on your faith but faith doesn't mean lack of music medicine so we don't want you to have a wrong idea here god uses hearts and hubs is medicine okay so he said he has created need for medicine than for medicine so even some of these hubs which are misused like in jagger it is god who created did you think it was those people who created it there are safari people it was god who created it for what purpose for medicine and this man was saying that he he found something which can treat covet confidence and he called it confidence yes look these friends of yours first of all they are not they are not believers not so usually even alcohol they say we are using it for medicine so you don't want to be inspired by a wrong from a wrong inspiration you need to be inspired from the world whatever it is that you do you might you need to be inspired that's why we need the holy spirit in our life because you cannot be able to design and certainly this guy is using weed and claiming it is medicine but actually they are taking it directly like this and it hits them because weed if you take it not in the right portion you can even die so they abuse it generally speaking if we is used for medicine you cannot even know you've taken it and it will even be in very small portions and those questions that's why science now has come you know they can be able to know which portion has how much and it can be you know most of these i i don't know how the antidepressants or whatever they the weight is inside there yes what is inside there there's medicine for pain and the sedation sedations and all that kind of thing with this inside there did you know that that's right what is inside there you see that's why they they say don't use it when you're like this don't use it because when you use it those things will happen to you you know so some of those medicines are even like diazepam don't go by but there's a pump because if you buy the azepam and you take it you know you'll become addicted and when you become addicted you're like someone who is taking weed so indeed this medicine is taken from those habs but even at that time god knew god had people that had the wisdom to do those habs in a way that would help the people even today we still have them so perhaps taking habits is not a scene as long as it is taken by someone who has the right inspiration who is inspiring them you know i don't want to take habs from a witch doctor okay i don't want to check herbs from you know so who is inspired what is their inspiration you understand yes so even the medications you know we don't have sometimes there are certain medicines me i cannot take what was the inspiration so usually you have to look at that but the issue is god uses all these things but certain times you can even take medicine and you don't get get well but as a child of god where the honor to get well the point here is one always you must believe that when you pray god answers your prayer now whether or not it materializes that's really up to god believe it has happened believe it has happened and keep believing it has happened if god wants it to be on you for very long it will be for a purpose it will be for a purpose there is no problem that comes to me without a purpose hallelujah i told you about cover 19 then give you the testimony yes that was a purpose hallelujah yes so friends let us continue because we may can you open that book the synagogue of saturn it is all right he says money isn't everything money isn't the answer and today it's not the answer either we have more wealth than we have ever had and yet less is being accomplished spiritually so it's not with money that god works god moves by his spirit you believe that and the moving of the of spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the wise amen amen all right [Music] i knew they blessed many of them which say they are jews and are not but at the synagogue of saturn here is a verse that will they have considerable not only because it is most i to begin with the word juice does not describe the religion [Music] same precise meaning if i want to say i am irish born people were saying that they were actually used real juice by birth just like that they were like as they were not used by birth and they [Music] they belong to the phones by him they were not of the true church but of the false church because god said they were the sinner book of satan now the word for synagogue is not the same word we use for church in the bible church means the quran ones or the summoned ones the sermons say about these elected people blessed is the man whom now chooses and causes should approach and to do it that he may join in then quotes some such as uh but the meaning of is assembly this can be good or bad but in this case it is bad for these are they whose assembling is not of good but of their own sales as i said isaiah behold they shall surely gather together but not by me whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for thy sin isaiah chapter 54 hallelujah since these were surely against the trumpet god will one day deal with them in destruction now why do we have a people mixed in the framework of the church and calling themselves jews the reason is this since they were like as they would make any claim they wished they would say that what they wanted as though it was a fact and then stick to it and in this case they would be lying with a very powerful thought in mind was it not so that the early church was almost if not entire entirely composed of jews making them the original members of his body the chain of apostles were jews and later apostles were a abuse of first lives that's for men to swear they were used to give them a preeminence and a claim of originality [Music] of originality tell a [Music] [Music] and that salvation is found only in health when they claim that they have the keys of the kingdom which they receive from peter and they claim that peter was their first pope and that he resided in rome when there is absolutely no historical fact for it and even her most educated annoying inheritance synagogue and if saturn be her father and he the father of liars of lies then it is not strange that those in his synagogue are liars also consider the thought of blasphemy these of certain syllables were not bloodstream including these instances though that go into brackets though that though that goes without saying but why but they were blaspheming their true church suddenly as kane participated and killed abram because he came was that we came and as they did for good good followers these are say they were of their father they were trying to destroy the equations in the first few years of the first age now the same group which is the false fine is even more strongly attempting to destroy the true believer in the second age that antichrist spirit is growing the group that inched its way ever so slowly into the church by its kids nikolai nikolai nikolai tenism no longer fears exposure but is openly organized in a group of its own ascending and is coming against the true church in this hostility now when i say this was unorganized and christchurch i am giving you the truth from an authenticated history the first church of the rome will address his history in the paganian age but the first the first church found in rome had already turned the truth of god into a lie by introducing a pagan religion with christian names and meaning by a second age it was a pagan so claiming to be the true church that polycarp came about 1500 miles at a very old age they played with them to turn back they would not do it they had a solid hierarchy and a solid organization and a complete departure from the world this then a certain synagogue full of blasphemy in which were already the seeds of the doctrine of the politician and which would shortly be the absolute power or satanic religion and this is exactly right for revelation chapter 2 verse 9 does not say these people does not say these people are of certain synagogue but it says they are certain synagogue this spirit of antichrist is not new this is not something that just came in the churches just been here all alone to get a clear understanding of how it works okay can someone help him can you switch how it goes against god and takes over in the church look at the old testament and see be there let us examine this spirit as it was manifested in israel as she came out of egypt to be a church in the wilderness just as the early church started out under the pure ministry of the holy spirit with signs and wonders and manifestations such as prophecy dance and interpretation wisdom knowledge and healing so in the days of israel when they left egypt they were under the leadership of the quality they were under the leadership of the spirit of god manifesting in gifts god was the leader of the people actually he was their king he was the father king he took care of israel like a man cares for his family he fed them fought their battles smoothed away their difficulties and settled their problems he just he just boosted himself over them they were the only nation to which he was truly god but one day they got to looking around and they saw the philistines and their nations with kings over over them and other nations but but but one day they got to looking around and they saw the philistines and other nations with kings over them they caught their eyes and they decided that they they called humanize their leadership so they wanted a king now god was going to humanize the leadership himself in the person of the lord jesus christ but they got ahead of him saturn knew the plan of god so he put it in the hearts of the people to get ahead of god the world when they approached someone and asked for a king someone was this dismantled that his this one he smiled that his heart almost failed him god had had been leading his people through his consecrated scripture scripture vindicated prophet and he he felt that he had been rejected he gathered the people and pleaded with them not to turn away from god okay so uh you see from down here it talks about the nicolan nicolantinism he talks about the seed the saturn is synagogue and we know that the nicole the seed which was planted in the first age the ephesian age the seed of nicolas remember what it was being what was it doing what is nuclear antenna someone you have to speak up so that the the speaker can capture your uh a microphone can capture your voice yes conquering of this have you heard that yes the people being put under the control and leadership of a man what man says is fine so that was the seed of nickelodeonism which was at that time a deep something which was being done by a group of people that were anointed by that wrong spirit but that spirit was growing growing growing now we're in the second age and the bible talks about the synagogue of saturn not those ones who are of the synagogue of saturn but the very synagogue of saturn and synagogue is a gathering so he says it is a bad gathering these people who are gathering together and remember they were calling themselves the church but by this time they have not yet nominated but they wanted kind of like israel how the israel wanted to have a man to rule over them instead of god but but the man here says that you see god wanted to give them a man that was jesus christ but for them they want a head of god always don't go ahead of god when you want something and you pray for it and you don't get it don't push god wait on him wait sometimes you may be like ah me i'm giving up things are not happening either way what don't do that always wait on god because they that wait upon the lord join me now shall renew their strength they shall mount up with wings as any they shall run and not be wary they shall work unknown faith imagine they that wait oh they shall mount up [Music] with as he goes they shall run and not be wary they shall [Music] one more time oh now they that way my sister my brother wait on him shall renew their strength [Music] as he goes they shall rise and not be wary they shall walk and not faith teach me lord teach me lord to wait teach me lord tease me lord teach me lord you know sometimes the blessing is just about to come and then someone gives up you know some people the devil deceives them and then they kind of say let me go on back a slide oh as god is living and in heaven let none of you ever do that hallelujah ask yourself because whoever is telling you let me go and be back asleep is not you it is a spirit a wrong spirit so ask talk back to it and say why are you going to back a slide or why do you want me to backslide and listen to those reasons they are all nothing you know the reason is usually never gives it is taking too long it will never happen you know look at this look at that look at this israel wanted a king but god was preparing for a king a befitting king for them but they landed on their own kings you know who they they got so david i saw that was not even willing to obey the voice of god i saw that you know made them suffer you know a david that you know was able to commit adultery and kill them you know a solomon you know all these kings had good parts on them but also they had a bad person on them and he said that you have hundred kings they will rule over they will because king here was a king is someone who has a domain and rules over as he wishes but god did not want israel to be subjected to an earthly king for man to rule over them because man will put his will on them god has always wanted to put his will on his children but the people have always desired to rush into receiving lordship don't rush to receive leadership in your life let god himself give you lordship so you see then they ended up indeed they ended up just like physical israel did the church also did the same thing they erected a man to become the head of the church and that materialized in the second in the third age which is coming pegamos but here we see the seeds of that growing maturing being watered are you following yet god had always wanted to be their own father you see and god has told us to come out of them like these denominations which our first denominations inspired by a wrong spirit to come out of them those churches that are having men ruling over the people to come out of them because god that's why this message is not anymore a man ruling over yeah this message is now the holy spirit again taking over rulership and headship of the church hallelujah you see god has always desired to have headship hallelujah all right you see so when samson cut off cut off his hair he was like any other man put the leadership of the holy ghost aside and the church is nothing but the world with god's name attached to it when they put the holy ghost or the holy spirit aside they become like samson but when he has no more strength on him you see the leadership of the holy spirit is the most important thing did you understand what i say some of you didn't understand oh this is an english fellowship i tell you this is for most of them don't understand uganda when you take the holy spirit out of the church the church has become simply a husk without life in it without anything you know completely not no life you see so it doesn't matter if you call yourself a christian anyone can do that the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without the spirit you are a reprobate you are none of yes you know when you read this church edge book and finish it by the time you are done you realize the major point that abandonment was emphasizing all throughout is to have the holy spirit and be led of him yes and number two to believe the word the inspiration of the holy spirit of the world in every age those two things because they are the same thing you know you cannot separate the holy spirit from the word and you cannot separate the word from the holy spirit it has always gone hand in hand if you believe that true teaching of the word but without the life of it you still do not have anything so i wonder why in the message some people say that the holy spirit is adultery you know as if that someone has a doctrine of the holy spirit i don't believe that it shouldn't even be treated as such if you treat it as such it's like these people today who have made oblocally to be saved they've made a denomination how can you make born again the denomination my national fellowship born again churches how can you even make a denomination and call it born again churches one again is not a denomination it's not a church it is a people who have had an experience with god people who have believed the word and have been filled with the holy ghost that's what it means to be born again but this people made denomination out of it so even in the message we should learn that we should never never accept for you to be put to a certain group because you you have emphasized the holy spirit or you have emphasized the word you must emphasize the word and you must emphasize the holy spirit if people think you are of the other group or the other it is their problem you are doing what is right this is what the message says i will do it you see that's why for for me i've always had this group that group this group many of thunders man your holy spirit this money that i don't care those are just the nomenclatures of people me where is my side my side is on the word of god and the manifestation of the spirit those two things is what we have seen in the bible in this message this message teaches us two things the true word of god and the manifestation of the spirit which gave that word yes and brother banamiya says that point the point is whether or not you have the spirit of god in you for without that spirit you are i reprobate i don't care whether you know but without that spirit you are what you are none of his so my dear my dear friends please get the spirit of god that you see how bad how serious it is for you to get the spirit of god how serious it is even if it needs you to go lock yourself up in your bedroom and pray until you receive the holy spirit do that you know it's not about the action of locking yourself and you know praying it's about the hunger and the desire for him you know it can happen anytime on you you know wherever you are you know you want to buy best in his presence and you know allow him to feel you alive from it through your heart to the exit whereby you know when he comes you are one of us going to go in the rapture because you have received a life his life in you you see so do not allow anyone to say that this is a pentecostal thing no she's not too long ago i asked a lady if she were a christian she said to me i'll have you know sir that i ban a candle every night what in the world has that got got to do with it i'm a methodist i'm a baptist i'm a pentecostal that has nothing to do with it i am a days of the voice fellowship ayama shakaina whatever i am uh i am a speckled bird ayama ayama come on give me those names revealed whatever please these are the voices leave these things aside as a matter of fact you as younger people huh yes you must not go out there to publicize the name of our denomination let me call it that way we are not said to publicize the name of the denomination well it's not a sin if you talk we church you fellowship in it's not a sin okay but people i fear even it is coming in the message whereby the names of their churches are so highly lifted up than even christ himself but the panel says i don't care what you say you are that has nothing to do with it it is the holy ghost or perish hallelujah it is the holy ghost or perish whatever you claim you are it is nothing receive the holy ghost or perish that's true and of course by the time he says receive the holy ghost means you've already received the word see starting where back there in the first church that people go to thinking and reasoning how to improve on god you know the deeds of the nicolas began showing themselves then a group formed they drifted away from the pattern of the one all it takes is is just one word changed under and a little even then leaving the whole lamp he that offends in one point of the law is guilty of all even just if just change the one word that will do that will do it and when someone centred the group and when that southern centered group was formed it began to hate and to fight the true believers insisting that they they the aliens were the church of god imagine the catholic church it says here they they but we know it is the catholics of course the catholicism they were saying that they are the true church of god notice how organization breeds hatred organization raise that rate i tell you take it from the prophet here organization breeds what you are your which church you ever please those things they bring hatred they make you see someone as if they are not believers please if you're going to be the standard business standard in this country god is looking for people who are going to be the standard everywhere whereby your standard is the word and if your word is your standard then you're going to be the standard everywhere you go because you will be a product of the world are you following yes do not lift up the name of your organization and do not agree with anyone who does it is not the church fellowship in these are fellowships please please can you hear me these are what but what is important he says notice how organization breeds hatred it destroys what yes it makes bitterness that is what this is what mana was full of bitterness a root off defies many so more and more defilement was coming in every age would feel its scars bitterness do not allow yourself to be organized organization the one he's talking about is not talking about he's not saying that you as a person must not be disorganized because we are not an organization does not mean we are disorganized no he is meaning you lifting up the name of your organization now the name of our organization is these are the rich ministries that's the our organization okay it's an organization because it is independent it is self-existent it doesn't need another one to exist we don't need little local charge to exist we are independent but that is nothing don't leave don't begin lifting it up slapping people with it everywhere what is important is christ these are names that we we have because of the laws of the country you cannot operate at a shop without a name but whether your name is the have it all goods or have nothing all goods all i care is whether inside there there are things that i am looking for so if i enter there and i find you have glucose i find you have water i find you have a nano i find you have a dukket oh that's the rich language now i find whether you have you understand yes if you have what i need then i will enter in and i'll buy from you you understand yes but you find people these days fighting over show up names is there is a issue the shop names it's just shops how does as well said it's just shops enter the shop because it is selling what you need what do you need water what do you need the word the water of the word so is this organization giving it to you yes then stick there but also do not again begin praising the organization right thank god for my organization and they begin to say if you don't come to this church you are lost are they the owners of heaven are they the ones with the kids of heaven please let us never come to that level when you listen to the by the way let me tell you people listen to the prophet when you listen to that message you begin to hear you begin to hear him emphasizing that when you begin to hear an organization belong here you are lost it is the first one it's the first one it means they have already become a denomination [Music] whether you attend any fellowship i don't care the issue is are you receiving the word do you believe the word true you have you received the holy ghost are you baptizing the holy ghost those are the two things that care the rest is not non-issues do you believe what i'm saying yes because it's here you see organization breeds hatred it destroys fellowship we're really supposed to be one big fellowship that's true when you hear someone just believe why you believe the message god bless you but these days it is changing brother the video of the message yes which group which group of the message when you tell them sometimes they even you know ask you which church are you from i don't care brother we just give me now i am from i'm coming from the church of the first born i am from the church of the believers i am a believer i am a son of god hallelujah i am filled with the holy you know it is destroying fellowship the moment you tell them i am from little flock i am from days of the voice fellowship this is a number ah okay ah that should you should not allow it to come among us yes you should not allow with friends you should not it is a bad thing and i say it with bitterness in my heart also that's true not the bitterness of the bad one the good one it is bad don't allow yourself to this fellowship other brethren because they are not from your church we are one members of the same fellowship the fellowship of believers and we must not allow ourselves to be segregated to be divided to be broken into pieces the other church if they preach the message they are my brothers if they they are my brothers if they think they have a special revelation that is their issue that's right all i know is i have a special revelation also and i will not just fellowship someone as long as they believe the message to the excellent one play by the banham had a brother and his name was gina jackson junior jackson believed the message was a preacher in america and by the bottom preached church order and junior jackson never applied it in his church and and by the ban i'm preaching that uh you know in you know when when people are speaking in tanks you know they should be able to interpret it uh and it should be done before the staff so you know what about the balance says and uh gina jackson said no that's okay but it's for brother branham turbina for us here we apply we do it the way we feel led and how are they doing it is that if you you're speaking things you can speak at any time and you can all pray you know let us all pray in times and this was a belief of the message and the believers in madame tabanaco started calling those believers in that other church uh black birds what were they calling them someone gave me that name i think black a birds or something like that black about and then by the bottom when you had everything they said what did i hear he said never do that again amen what were they calling them he said never do that again but the junior jackson is my brother he's my brother he's a believer of this message as far as i know this is what the prophet is saying he says if he wants to teach his church that it's up to him he will answer for that on the day of judgment but as far as i am concerned he's my brother the believers they are my brothers hallelujah amen so friends never ever disfellowship anyone as long as they are believers of the message whether they say they believe that seven thunders or the eighth hundreds of the ten thunders as long as they believe the message that's right okay the more revelation they have that's up to them leave them with those revelations if they say brother do you have something say well i don't as long as there's a message brother if they show you a quote you say yeah i mean i believe that they show another quote oh man i believe that so what are you fighting about but brother you are believing in the wrong way you believe brother please please brother you can remember the explanations but i believe this message i'm reading here i believe what i am seeing here for your explanations you can remain with them brother but you are my brother that's all that matters hallelujah that's the attitude that we ought to have as believers of this precious message don't divide yourselves and separate yourselves and get groups and hear you know you know this money and church had drifted far from the original it had become a hybrid it had hybridized itself in the way of eve you know that a hybrid is what comes over the two species mixing the result is no longer pure like the original it is mongrel where when he allowed the beast to mingle his seed with us she produced a creature called cane that wasn't pure human he was of the wicked one notice how different he was from aber notice how different he was from seth he hated god and would not obey the word and persecuted and killed the writers he set himself up above the word of god you see what it happens when you mix up yourself with the things that are not the word don't hybridize yourself now then i you know you know i believe that each of you have read line by line okay so i'm only taking a few highlights that i thought that it could be highlighted for us here and brother in the rest of the paragraph that talks about high breeding hybridizing hybridizing and you know what hybridizing is is a mixture to mix the wrong and right don't mix when you mix you get something which seems as if it is strong but when it is really mixed up some people are mixing the message with their own ideas don't mix this message with your ideas if someone is doing that leave them alone leave that thing alone always have sweetness around you welcome everybody be receptive if you know they kind of try to say something that you feel is wrong listen to them a little more listen to them if it's not really right it's not clicking with you leave it alone and still love the person you see that's the attitude and the nature of jesus christ see the ass can be read okay fine um he talks about hybrid ready john eve hybrid ready john and it was money and age was dying when it died it never came back no age ever comes back no revival ever comes back it can't have the life of god in it by natural generation it takes a regeneration from above the last edge started with the fires over pentecostal revival and they organized it right back instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and did just what every age has done sabji substituted the manual for the word you know they they substituted the manual for the word meaning they have their own church manuals you know uh their own church manuals which they now have instead of the word of god don't substitute the word of god the bible this message for anything else this last age started with the fires of a pentecostal okay where was i then he says excuse me he says instead of taking the word they took their own ideas and they did just whatever age has done substitute the money for the word just you step outside the manual just you step outside that manual and see what happens you are out brother and they will persecute you and blame it on god hallelujah he says step out of that money and see what will happen hallelujah oh my that's why you should give this book to other those that have wanted to believe this message if they read this statement you'll hit them step out of that money meaning the church money step out of it and see what will happen they will persecute you and then they blame it on god and they love the organization no wonder they are they are second generation pentecostals they are second generation pentecostals and since god doesn't have grandchildren but you put it off it was just down there you know we're still on the same line i don't know why you are putting it up just keep rolling down um they are second generation pentecostals and since god doesn't have grandchildren they are just children of their fathers known by their creeds and and and form of fellowship they can talk about what used to be but they can't produce it oh my jesus christ can someone explain this point for me i need someone to talk about this what i just read yes what i've understood from this point is that these people they created their own crates obviously they were not a board and they are following they are fathers so here it says that women have grandchildren so they are following their fathers so it's like they are grandchildren you can say that they have got them maybe like grandchildren well my god you see they are following their fathers they are following their mothers they are following their family members they are following their brothers and sisters you know the all they know is by their creeds and form of worship they can talk about what used to be who are these people these are the ones who can do what talk about what what used to be but they can't produce it but they thank you are you with me but they cannot work but somebody has to go together you are lost are you okay is it well with you bro you see you can stand surely you can stand and fall they can talk about what used to be but they cannot produce it they cannot but these people can talk about what used to be but they cannot produce it what they used to hear but they cannot what about the venom deep but they cannot what is the producing part of it what does it what is it trying to point to manifestation what's the producing part of it what is it no no no just answer my question what's the producing part of it what is it you gave me the answer what is it manifestation it is the manifestation of the power of god is the manifestation of the spirit hallelujah that manifestation let us not talk about it only there is an application where people just get the talk or talk about just talking a lot of nonsense huh people are just there wasting a lot of time don't join such things by the way you know you you have social media but limited don't just join it for the sake of journey some they tell you come be on track or talk you just come on the talk or talk what you know limit it even what's up me you know what i did on my whatsapp i removed the application right now have you had an application anything disturbing me you see but messages are very busy coming yeah but i have not put all my uh notifications i told them please remove all that don't disturb me when i'm not having the phone that's what i told my phone so my phone is able to help me when they send me messages it keeps quiet and when i want to read them now i will come i know too big all of them ah now i can see so when you send me a message and i don't answer don't worry i'll get to you when it is the right time so don't allow technology to waste your time every time you are there you are there what you are talking with someone you you pick immediately again again again again so when you see the day you know like this iphone it tells you how many hours you have been on there on the phone for the whole week when you count those hours my good lord when i counted those hours i said oh no the phone is not going to rule over me i will limit those hours let it be one or little bit two there are a lot of things you can do but a lot of time is western on docker talk applications like toca talk i don't even know what they do there we can talk talk here please get out of choco talk get out of facebook get out of all those things and only go there when it is necessary you understand yes it's not a sin to be there but don't waste your valuable time that's what i'm trying to say don't waste it sometimes we preach it like this and then people look for other ways of talking to you why do you want me to talk to you in another way than this well this is the best way of talking friends [Music] yes by the way we can talk to one another if i've already told you leave your talk and you were here listening to me and again you wanted me to deprive it what is wrong with you you know one time paul told the the russians what is wrong with who bewitched you because paul was telling them the truth and they hear it and then they go there someone tells them something else they also do it sometimes we come here we preach we preach don't dress shut things me up what what you find someone still dressing them what is wrong with you can't you understand or you have a problem huh it means there is a problem maybe your father is not my father amen yes we need to talk like that now sometimes not say about republican do you agree with me yes yes the world should change changing powers in the world it is not in the in in the private talks private counseling wasting a lot of time for nothing counseling should be you should seek for counseling only when you have been dealing with things and trying to struggle and to leave you that you can't and you need counseling you really need help you have to understand not just wasting time over preacher it comes to you you ask things which are answered in the preaching wasting a lot of valuable time then you also become like a talker talk you see they they can talk about it what used to be but they can't produce it they can't let us produce that life oh god help us brothers sisters let us produce that life let us produce it it must be the salt of the earth be the poor don't just come here and hear about it and then talk about it but your life is dry nothing there we heard about the life of god manifestation of the spirit what's the manifestation of the spirit speaking entire times praying in the spirit and the interpretation of that and you can be able to say everything but when you see your life you are right you don't dream you don't see visions you you you don't talk tongues you don't need to freak thanks you don't pray you don't sing you don't do nothing but you're talking talking talking about it wasting people's time oh [Music] i'm sorry you know something just came and took me over i hope it was the holy spirit i believe it was the holy spirit friends we should manifest these things we should allow we should produce not manifest because it is not as we manifest it's not the orange that manifests the orange it is the life in it that brings it out if you do not have the these things ask god to give you the holy ghost because if you don't have the holy ghost and you try to manifest it you will only try to do what the pentecostals are doing they're impersonating it because they have no life but one time when the world always fills your life oh i tell you you will get into realms that you have never gotten into ever before amen when you go into prayer get closed in with god and you know listen to the spirit of god you know and all your soul body and spirit and allow him to permit through your body and soul and spirit to the extent whereby you can come and take over your mind brother your mind brother whereby you go to so and so brother who has been also praying with you in the same room and you don't even know what he has been on his heart about him there you've got to even tell him brother hear the word of the lord that says the holy spirit blah blah blah blah and everything is what has been praying for that's what we are looking for the manifestation of that spirit because we don't want to talk talk talk talk but there is no production we must produce the life not only those manifestations but we must also produce the the the the the the right feuds we must show that we are changed we must produce that kind of life if you were wearing a miniskirt scrap it straight away if you were you know having girlfriends boyfriends kind of separate yourself do it don't just you know hear about it do it brother you get a point let me tell you a true child of god how they behave the moment they hear about the word they are convicted and i didn't know they go and do it immediately amen this is how i was when i came to this message i was not born in the message when i came into this message i did not know what was right and what was wrong some of the things which i knew was wrong i found out it was wrong some of the things which i did not know that they were wrong i found out it was wrong so whenever i would hear a picture preaching it i would not reason with him i would go oh no i didn't know really i said oh god forgive me i go change it i will change it i will change it the moment the day i had it i believe and under no circumstances i'm unbeliever hey i said i didn't know me i thought that as long as you can preach them they believe you can bring them or you can talk to them and they they just come to church and then marry them and then they can believe any time at first i thought like that you know so i had my friends who were girls at at school and i told you that there are no friends who are girls if their friends are they're girls they're girlfriends okay don't deceive us you don't come and talk in languages which you don't understand i have friends which are your friends you know boys there are boys there but a very close friend of mine so are they your boyfriends no don't deceive us they're just obvious why what kind of thing is that what what extent okay fine it's okay to have a hobbies with you and all this but how long do you talk with them you find a brother talking with an old gift for almost six hours a day and then she says just a friend but not a girlfriend but just a friend that brother needs god you know when i had this thing for the first time i did not i had all those girlfriends of mine you know and uh i did not defile myself with them no i didn't do that but you see i was their friends you know would do hung up together on on phone you know i i was rich at that time even i had my i had my nokia father today it was it started tutoring for the three ten yeah i had a thousand two ten years you know nozzy whatever so i would hang out with them sometimes you would go how are you saying i'm fine yeah i was the crazy yeah you know you know things like that you just hang out you know you think it is a not harmless i'm full at all but when the preacher preached it in the church hey hey my heart was like why that is wrong i didn't know oh god forgive me i surrendered i surrendered i went and scrapped off that phones it from my phone i cut off the communication i cleared up my myself and whenever i would meet them share the word that's no no further stories into their lives into my life i had already had you cannot marry and believe you see i already knew that the moment you know something don't fight with god if you begin fighting it means you're listening with god you're trying to say you are trying to make first god accept you the way you are don't be like okay be like abby when god tells him something he does it but cain he wants to go to accept him the way he is don't do that let god change you when you hear something for your first time even if you had never heard of it now you have heard it and god will judge you if you don't do it you see so even these things i'm talking about the manifestation of the life of jesus christ in you you know through the theme the the the feast of the spirit the manifestation of the of the gifts of the holy spirit in your life i'm not just talking about it for us to hear a very good story that's you know the true church always has a manifestation of the gifts of the spirit ah they talk tongues and they you know shout and sing yeah and then just leave it there and then we go to another chapter then i should close my books and then i say i will never go into this bible study again if i'm not going to see those things happening then we don't even need to do what we are doing if i'm not going to see people feeling god with the holy spirit then i don't need to continue being what i'm doing because it means god has not blessed it let me see those things happening let me see that life of jesus christ god wants to see it in our life yes or else what we're doing we're just bluffing we're just playing around so we are not reading to read we are reading to apply what we have read let us see it going through our bodies hallelujah and you are calling yourself a christian and all your life you have even never felt the power of the holy spirit running through your body never not even one time and you're saying you're christian you should revise that kind of christianity you should revise it actually you should revise it give me that quote let me let me show you let me show you a quote here seriously what the prophet says about this matter you are a christian but you your christianity is a very calm christianity not even current very dead one let me show you here it says that um [Music] you see he says listen some of some of them said this is believers that this in the message believes that this 1953. some of them said where badabana it is emotional i'll start from up here and when he went into the holiest of all his once yeah he had to wear a certain kind of a garment and he had to be anointed and he had to take blood with him is that right and on the helm of his garment he had a promo pomegranate and a bell and a pomegranate and a bell and here and he walked a little and he had to make that play holy holy holy unto the lord and only the way they knowed that that man was still alive that god hadn't slayed him back there in the behind the curtain is because that because that noise because of that noise there that the noise it was making yeah do today today to read read holy holy holy unto the lord you know that kind of noise then they could hear the bell ringing i tell you the only way i know there is any life in the church is when a little noise gets started somewhere right god bless you two brothers who said amen amen i tell you can i read it again yes the only way i know the only watch in the church when a little noise gets started somewhere you know just a little amen once in a while or a little something you know make a little noise this is something you can choose to do you know no one is trusting you you know you hear the word that you choose to shout amen or just to be there you know the prophet tells you make a what some of them said well by the ban i mean it is emotional well i can't scientifically prove to you anything without emotion is dead that's true so if your religion hasn't got any emotion by the thing [Laughter] if your religion has not got what any emotion body but i eat it is dead my dear by that thing because it is no good it is dead how many believe that what i'm saying you people do not ever fear that when i do this way when the holy spirit moves on you you know sometimes you know i remember when i was still young in the church i didn't there were there were no people in the church at that time you know shouting and you know saying a man and running around so many times when the word would be preached but let me tell you the truth of the matter is if you are a seed of god and the word of god is being preached to you even if you are dead you will come alive because at that time i had not known all the things i know today i had not known you know most of the mysteries even though the message but simple preachings you know pastor would preach and ministers would come and preach but whenever they're preaching you know people many of them were new in the message so but we'll just sit and listen to the word and say amen you know what's the word but sometimes you know i would be preaching until i feel like shouting i just feel like maybe standing up and you're shouting or crying but then i look around you know and then i see no one is feeling the way i'm feeling i'm like oh god and then i leave it i need to you know go there inside and then something i want to pick up and push and pressure then i would be like look around no one is being hit and then i'll be ashamed sometimes i would literally groan um you know let me tell you don't do that i did it but don't do it i did it but the moment god set me free and god gave us more revelations i never thought from that time i never close that a feeling you know right don't close it in when the word of god is going in and you're feeling to shout the feeling to jump your feelings run around you're feeling to clap your hands your feelings to prophesy don't resist the holy spirit don't resist the holy spirit you know what i'm talking about yes i'm not preaching emotions to you i am i am teaching to you that you must arrive because you see it it's all about you your choices if the holy spirit comes down and and you do not do anything you don't you know you ask what do you have in the hands if you remain like that what do you have in the earth moses i'm just here god i said i have a stick you understand so what you have is your child what you have is your club so god can move on you i don't know i'm not saying he will tell you to clap but he might tell you to clap i'm not saying he will tell you i don't have to be the one to tell you to do that right the holy spirit knows what is right at that moment maybe when you do that very thing that you have told you to do like you told us people to run around that city seven times of jericho you know when you tell them to do that yes something happened so it tells you to do something whatever it is that he has told you and you refuse to do it maybe that one or is it going to be the source of your deliverance and just be there when you refuse to do it and you'll be there nothing will happen for sure i'll tell you that nothing will happen you will have you are the religion you will come in the church with that religion you will walk out with it and some people they be busy for god you know they are on the phone when the what is going on or they're thinking about still god cannot walk through you or what i'm saying that for him to speak to he can't speak to you you need to open your mind you want to avail yourself for him when he comes down and when he comes down and you are available you avail yourself things are bound to happen i tell you things are going to happen you know he's bound to move when you are he's about to feel you the holy ghost is bad maybe he can tell you you know run around shout do this you know kneel down simple simple things and you're like some people are like that god tells you to do something well even there is no time the pastor was saying we have only one minute you know don't ever do that you know yeah i'll do it when we have a longer service ah whatever i tell you god is not a god of time he's the god of eternity and therefore when he it shows up everything else we were going to do stops ah it is now almost six sunday when i begin shouting right now it may take a bit longer hey [Music] things begin to happen when you free yourself when you lose yourself when you lose yourself when chat begins i kind of feel that there's something what is going to do right here we're in the preparation of it when that's resumed something is going to happen in some people i really feel that struggle in my heart now he says but let them talk to you you can give it to me again and then we see where to stop because we have 30 minutes and we want to close now let them talk to you about the glories of their movement they will say yes sir i want you to know that this is a move that no man started it came spontaneously the spirit fell all over the world yes sir we got that we got what they had at pentecost this was not of men but of god then why didn't you why did they keep it that way if god started it how come god couldn't keep it and finish it and if they said they started when god was moving in when i believed the message oh i tell you i was praying like this i was doing this i was doing it now why are you not doing it anymore what what happened if god didn't write a handbook of grids and formulas and documents to start it then why what right did they have to do that yeah now they are he's talking about the denominations now yeah they have all those things now [Music] someone read for me that paragraph that next paragraph polycarp bridge an experiment yes god power word pod out history according baptist methodist netherlands adventists brethren of god several surnames etc all these brethren were brought up on different doctrines bylaws church manners etc what sucked it all to one side destroyed their dispensation of theories and restore the gifts of the spirit proving is the same yesterday and today and forever but did those pentecostals learn their lesson about organization no sir they organized right right back and have written their own textbooks bylaws and church menu fellowship book as a terror with one idea in mind which is to prove that they now have all the truth know the answers and therefore the allies of god who know the way and can show it and to others as god's appointed guides but they haven't got it they have they have hybridized themselves like the very groups they came out of if they want to be in their brain they are going to have to come out exactly as did their fathers hallelujah that is why in this message we don't have church menus that's why this message we don't have a church man doctrine man dr no money that if you want to know the doctrine of this church read this book i don't think i don't even know of nmsu church which has that hallelujah that's why this message cannot denominate this message you cannot denominate you see what we have in the message is god the leadership of there holy spirit we have the message we read our bible and that is it we i read it i can read a verse i can read our quote and then the next is the holy spirit interpreted for us through our preaching like how do you brothers preach what do you do when you go there before you even go there by the way what did you do before you started preaching you see you were led by the holy spirit you did not um uh god read from such money or what you say our such money is the word of god hallelujah we don't write my pastor wrote this and that every doctrine that should be taught whatever the word should be told it should be taught according to this book and you know you should read it like that you say that this one is like this you see even in this message that's why that when people read the message each of them comes out with their own opinion because it's not a manual a manual is a clear cut this is this and this is that and this is that period but this message has many rooms and many uh uh uh channels that people can be able to read and the holy spirit can be able to channel them the way he wants to channel those people at that time it's not like ammonia what's burning docker sweats bunny so it's it's not like in a menu yeah you know we are we are at home so i i i don't know you need to maybe check something so saints we are not in any denominational setup whereby uh we have a manual and things are have to be this way and things have to be that way no things have to be the way god wants it we we have the message and but abandonment was led by the spirit while he was preaching he didn't wasn't reading from a textbook he read and preached from the bible we read and preached from the bible hallelujah that's why sometimes i can quote there is no formula some now you are beginning to see do you by the way let me tell you now while we are still here hey sister doctors you need to come back and hear this also and all of you who are online please i wanted to hear this very very very very important there are some people that have come up with a very very bad idea i call it a bad idea because it is not a lead of god it's a wrong adultery it's a wrong spirit and they're saying that preachers must be silent and they must only read the message of brother banner so you get a message book do i have one here this one is a demonology so you take a demonology and begin reading for the believers so friends there we are going to preach about demonology the physical realm help of the lord we could carry the meeting right on through ourselves that's the reason i am glad to see it go over a little bit for that one reason i believe the lord will help us to do it congregation says amen now you know there is i love my management i have some lovely brethren bosworth baxter lindsay moore all those has got five of them brother back brother von braun back there what are you trying to do what's the point and after finishing the book they then you say ah man we shall we shall continue from there next sunday then you tell them bye now as i'm demonstrating this for you some of them are saying but reading the message is not bad and now that's not also right so it kind it's a wrong spirit which comes in a way it comes in a trail that we always go you know the holy spirit hated me right now the serpent this one we are talking of that woman jezebel they never they never knew how people can be trapped when you want to drop a certain animal in a forest you first of all should know the road it always takes if you want to drop a rat in your house you must know where it passes you will lay that snare in that very road where it passes the devil therefore knows that the only way he can drop people is through worship because people human beings are created with a desire to worship [Music] and therefore he has desired to ensnare and trap them through worship of the beast through worship in first denominations and religions you know that is how he will give them the mark of the beast through worship but also through worship worshipping the right to god you will get the true holy spirit so worship is it bad no but in this case it is worshiping the wrong thing they never know that's how you will trap them in the same way the same cunning devil he knows the only way he can get message believers is by attacking them through their message books one he has tried for very many years for more than 50 years now to make a message a believer stop listening to the depths to make them stop reading or not read at all and he has failed because the more he makes them to stop the more they read now he has devised another thing what he's going to do i'll make them get by a statute how he will inspire and anoint some certain men to come and bring first doctrines by the message how you know for us we are the believe the true believers of the message and if you are true believer of the message in your church you must do two things one you must play the table by the bottom only no preaching of any preacher or you must read only the message for the people and even if you're preaching you're preaching only from one message don't say now i'm preaching but let me all support from the church educate yourself from seven seas don't do that if you do that you are back as leading preachers that doctrine is ready they say if you do that your back is reading you must only read from one message you must only read the message you must only play tips for the people now what does it make other preachers who know that that's the wrong spirit they will say ah that's a wrong doctrine and the devil thinks he's going to make us now let us say we shall not read the messages anymore we shall now say we only read the bible because those ones are preaching the wrong doctrine the devil says ah i have not got them i have not got them they can no longer read the message they can no longer play the traps because i knew when i do like this they will now not play it they'll never read it let me tell you now i'm telling you because you're younger people this spirit is already out in the country it's read all over the world even here in uganda it's already here if you have not heard it of it yet and now you will face it one time let me tell you god is perfect will for this generation god this perfect will for this generation is the word yes and what is the word for this generation is the revelation of this bible by the prophet he has said in our generation no man can claim to know the message without reading the message books without listening to the tricks you understand but who told him that the banana is the only preacher in our generation there are many other preachers and they are going to be preaching from the inspiration of the prophet of the day hallelujah so see brother balaam said i preached what paul preached brother said that i preached what paul preached that's what he said [Music] what did the paul preach can we go there there are very many now first episode of paul the apostle to timothy who wrote this who wrote this answer me apostle paul but abandoned he preached what paul do you find him doing this paul an apostle of jesus christ by the commandment of god our savior and the lord jesus christ which is in our hope and to dream of fame my own son in the faith grace being mercy and from god i found in the lord jesus christ and i bet amen god bless you we shall meet and read from their next service do you find him doing that why yet he said he preached what paul preached to preach what by the bottom preaches does not mean i am going to become a parrot a parrot only reads nonstop doesn't have any more revelation doesn't have any more inspiration but the same oh it is burning in my heart i think i need to preach a message on this the same inspiration the same revelation that of the message is what we have received by reading his message the same spirit which he had the same holy ghost which he had is the same one of god which we have now hallelujah and therefore we can also preach from his message and quoting his message quoting the bible and even sometimes you can preach without quoting anything and we preach the same same thing which by the banana preached hallelujah because it is the same inspiration and now you find another group which is saying you know we have the same holy spirit here so it is the same revelation the same inspiration we don't need by the bottom at all because we can continue from where he stopped the rafa whatever he did full stop now let us continue from where he stopped then you will find them interpreting the things even but i'm already talked about in their own way you see those spirits are both ways that's right they will now say as if they are the only ones who believe in the holy spirit now those of you who are quoting by the banham for the people you are parrots we don't touch those because that's the demand that they said it's that demand what is life now now now is for me you're a person now right now what i'm saying is the one which is afresh that is also wrong with spirit it's also spirit from hell yes the true spirit or messenger of god when he comes yes he will speak like the other messenger spoke but he will also quote him read your bible very well jesus quoted the prophets paul it peter each of them were quoting each other the one who came later was putting the one who came in before he this is how the holy spirit works hallelujah why would peter paul even tell us believers in the uh ephesus to be baptized again because of what peter said in acts chapter two paul was quoting peter jesus we would say many times he was reading over me in the old of the old time john was quoting isaiah what are you talking about the true messenger will preach the same message but they will also quote they will record that message and they will now preach it in the power and in the demonstration of the spirit you understand whereby even when you are that's the purpose by the way of preaching so that when you are yeah there may be another letter what the preacher comes he has prayed after them by the mountain comes and it stands in the book and begins [Applause] what happened to you it is because the world was coming with such power the world was coming with such anointing which was fresh for your time but that brother was preaching by inspiration from the same message and the bible which you have you see so these two spirits we should watch them very very carefully they have come to destroy the church and we must know how to balance and stand in the right way what's the right way we believe the message we believe the bible we should listen to the message you should read the bible we should read the message you understand but also we must preach it let no man silence you if you're a preacher and you're going to be let no man tell you to keep quiet that's true the devil has always desired to do that let no man tell you to keep quiet let me tell you even if they tell me to keep going i cannot keep going even if i so wish to keep quiet i cannot find a stop button of keeping white hallelujah i can't because i am pressed already amen it's not me who press myself play preach it is god who put it in me and he who put it to me amen he keeps on even you know refiring it refining it every time putting more fire more fire more fire and even when i want to stop i can't stop even when i'm sick like that and i'm tired and i'm wearing when i begin preaching and waiting comes how dare you tell me that the holy spirit is not here because you know they will tell you they have many ways of channeling their ideas one of them came to me said the inspiration comes to you in a generation they did the deliberation of the word i said it by the bomb said the word are you a prophet in other words to say the word comes the inspiration comes to a prophet and you cannot receive inspiration i looked at him like that so in other words they are saying there is no more manifestation of the spirit what have we been reading from the very message they are saying they believe what have we been reading what are the two characteristics of the true church of the living god number one preaching the pure word of god don't don't skip don't skip number one preaching that viewer word of god hallelujah what is that what the apostles preached what the message speaks and number two the manifestation of the power of god hallelujah the manifestation through gifts of the spirit so then if how can you how can how can i prophesy unless i'm inspired how can i preach unless i am inspired how can i talk tongues unless i'm inspired so in other words you are shouting off all the inspiration you are saying that ended with the prophet you are now an unbeliever we have seen you we now know who you are because the message says you are an unbeliever if you don't be left in inspiration in our generation [Music] hallelujah oh i need to preach on this seriously because now i feel really anointed on this matter hallelujah god help us ah our time is done right so can we finish until we reach the 10 years of brother why did i feel that we will finish the discharge chapter today was i mistaken oh yeah i wasn't mistaken but what is it that we have done we have been taking it slowly in reading questions questions and questions which we were not doing at first we're just hovering over but i think what we're doing is good also amen so can someone read they are like all the rest they are like all the rest by the political can they proceed they are like all the rest the revival is over they are trying to leave a name and a dead they took organization and they took organization all the while talking about the spirit of god they talk about the evidence of the holy spirit but they forget that they forget that the devil can talk in terms to the utterance of confu of confusion of babel is in their midst and they call it the spirit of god once again we see man telling god instead of god telling man now you might deserve to scold me right here what i have said all right they call themselves in the boston and full gospel let me prove it at pentecost the fire came in a cloud and separated over each of them like at times and fell on each one why is the fire these tongues and pentacles and the whole people who listen understood why is that the whole multitude of believers acted like one family pentecostal as pentecostals are as badly divided as any group in history no man just joined himself to the early church but only god had it they have as many gods among them as any they claim to be full gospel but they can't prove it they are charged their touches as empty of power as any of them empty of power no power where is the power even in the message oh don't let me speak these things continue if they are full if they're full gospel then better admit the bible made a mistake when it describes the four goals for men and spectacles they seem there's been a great change in me they're right but the change has not been for the better it is time to get back to god it is time to get back to god they have a name that they live but a dead tongue isn't evidence the evidence of revival it is the evidence of death that's true that has proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the jews was over that's that's a new era had begun tongues today is bringing down the cutting of the gentile church legends and the gospel is going back to the jews people are talking about terms erupting in a great spiritual move they have missed the words the truth is that it is writing is writing the finish to all man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is being ushered in wake up people of god go back a little bit where are we now you might you might want to score me right here no no no it's time to get back to god okay yeah uh where he starts talking about tanks oh yeah right there right there it's uh time to get back to god begin there it is time to get back to good they have a name that they live but are dead tongues isn't the evidence of revival it is the evidence of death tons proclaimed the evidence that the ceremonial religion of the jews was over that a new era had begun tanks today is ringing down the cutting of the church ages and the gospel is going back to the jews people are talking about guns heroin herod in a great spiritual move they have missed a boat the truth is that it is writing writing the finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is being ushered in wake up people of god wake up if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both pentacles go back a little bit up the truth is that it is writing it is writing the finish to all of manny's just right there man's ideas problem don't go up brother uh just go down a little bit yes is that it is writing they finish the finish to all of man's ideas programs and kingdoms and the kingdom of god is being ushered in you see well it's not like saying that tongues are satanic and not good but he's saying that times god has always used times you check in the old testament he used time you know when the kingdom of was it never canada was ending yes he used times to show him it was a sign that your kingdom is coming to an end so even now trunks are being used the other pentecostals think oh it is a sign that it's a great revival and a great move of god no actually it is a great sign but what sign it is a sign that god is closing and finishing with the general dispensation and going going in over to bring his kingdom down hallelujah we know that's what's happening the kingdom of god is now about to come continue reading brother wake up people wake up if you don't think this is true just listen to this all over the world in both pentacles in those pentecostal and fundamental groups they are organizing a businessman they have invented the pulpit without a call from god they have styled themselves they they have still themselves the officials of men and the founders of a move of good and they accept the gifted ministry of ephesians chapter 4 verse 10 to 13 that god gave the churches god gave the church has failed so they are taking over here we are right in the midst of the fulfillment of profession called the against saying or quora and they don't even know that they have fulfilled it they are blindly going on preaching experience for clothes may god have pity on them may their eyes be opened before it is too late all listen to me when did the prestige of money social leadership business ability or sheer mental prowess ever qualify a man for spiritual leadership or give any way to the one word and when in any way material maturity or human values begin to show as the media by which god works instead of the holy spirit alone then we are fighting against god not for him now i want this one report right here i am not speaking against elders in the church no sir and that elder can and that elder can be as poor as any man who has given up or be the richest man in the world as long as he is an elder in heart and i would not expect to ordain any man that has the real spiritual qualification as an elder what he called regardless of his finances or social position but when you see a social or financial structure come into the church that divides the folks in any way that is not of god it is another sign of the time it is physically rich but spiritually improved in overwatch or impoverished now nation age in which we are now living i know they provide did you notice that their property is linked up with the synagogue of saturn in the same bus yes it is the rich powerful organization that has the world and always pushes out the little people moves in the hearts of men who is it that leaves the building and equality the life the little flock always loses out to the big organization and where do the people then go they worship in homes old stock buildings and basements just as they did when they went today cutting homes these people were poor in this world's goods suddenly but they were rich in spirit i know they are blaspheming now it isn't the thought here that these liars are blaspheming good though that goes without saying but they are blaspheming the true church it is always thus the jews of jerusalem plus film the church at the beginning the gentile politic politics did likewise if anyone is going to be spoken of it will always be the true seed in narrows day the christians were blamed for every calamity even for the burning of rome in communist countries a little flock is always the first to be examinated though actually insignificant in size the other questions are fine lawyer people who do only good they will always be persecuted to the end that they might be physically destroyed right now they have opened up everything but the churches and someone was telling me come to think of it is it that because the churches are bad or that the churches they will will spread the coroner very fast yet in in the people who go to churches are more disciplined than the ones who are going to the market but they kind of feel that our churches should be closed you see it's always a target group anyhow the reason this is so is because they are a rebuke to the god the godless like i saw thumb they stand out before the wicked and though the writers intend no harm to the wicked but want to do all the good invariably they find that they are embroiled as was john the baptist with herod for john did not want to harm either herod or his wife but to save them from his rock from the wrath of god this was not only thoroughly misunderstood and absolutely with the stood but john was put to death because of which can imagine and for all the good the people of god do they are still put to public shame unto death can you imagine [Music] so please this is what we know always happens so to believe jesus doesn't come without a price surely there must be some sinister force behind a people who would be so void of conscience that they would return evil to those who did them good yes there's such a force it is saturn the answer lies in the next verse which is revelation 10 which says for none of those things which thou shalt suffer behold the devil shall cast some of you that fear none of those things the devil shall cast some of you in prison that he may be tried and he shall have tribulation ten days be thy faithful unto death and i'll give thee a crown of life and we'll start from there next tuesday my my god bless you and uh there's quite much quite much quite much for us to cover i'm sure that you will continually be blessed as we cover this amen just continue piling little by little by little soon you realize it's quite much in your heart oh little is much when god is and you can win it if you go oh there was a crown and you can win it oh if you go in jesus name yes if you go in jesus name amen let me ask him brother joe where to pray
