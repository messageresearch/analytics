for a number again all right so let us uh stand on our feet and we go straight away to the scripture in the book of first peter we it would be good if you can switch on your video but according to also thank you for joining us and uh to all those who can switch on their videos if you can [Music] okay i mean and i'm reading in the name of our lord jesus it says peter an apostle of jesus christ to the strangers scattered throughout pontus galactia cappadocia cappadocia asia and bithynia knowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit and to obedience and sprinkling from the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be unplanned i'm i'm going to be speaking on verse 2. which says elect [Music] according to the full knowledge of god amen amen and you know our my main subject this morning is on that foreign you know my title of course is coming from verse 2 elect according to the full knowledge of god and so we noticed that uh we are in a generation where we have christians who do not care what they do now first they have preachers who have told them it does not matter what you do we have many believers who have been told well you have been i met this group of people merci canada and uh they were respectarians and i do not know their doctrine right now they loved the world and we were sharing the word [Music] i said what happened we're gonna teach you how to say oh why didn't you why did you not even tell me you know if you had a problem or if you had robbers come to you so you told me i'm selling my brother but the issue and i was really drunk and amid that so it [Music] you young people who like asking this what is the intention of asking that question [Music] they have their [Music] make fun and i see but this brother because he was told that alcohol or drinking is not a sin that he was protested you told me brother you don't know [Applause] [Laughter] it's too full that's not right and this morning by the grace of god i want to uh address i may not go into all the details but that's the line of thought i have this morning he calls them strangers because they are [Applause] non-jews verse verse 2 that's where he talks about them being elected you know because they're from cappadocia pontus asia virginia and all those places of the gentiles and he said these are the elect you are the irish according to the foreign [Applause] of god i want us to look at romans chapter 8 verse 28 and we know that all things and after that i will read also ephesians chapter one and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the code according to his purpose electromagnetic [Music] work [Applause] [Applause] later a new reason a massacre together he says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate him to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren whom he did predestinate they may also call amen we are going to reverse this verse later it is you know uh they give me efficiency according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in life and then it says having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will why is can you give me the next verse to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he has made us accepted through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now you remember there is a series i just finished on on to this man will i look again a man he said a man with a contrite spirit your country [Applause] he you remember jesus his death on the cross was because of you and me why did what where's god himself for you and me now if it is [Applause] and he says [Applause] given we'll get them katari when you go in the market you're going to buy tomatoes you will buy papaya peppers oranges but you will not buy everything in the morning and this is the subject i want you to go with me will be like teaching but also preaching a little bit god because of being god and [Applause] was for the elect that would receive it because he continues on to say but for god's soul of the world otherwise if it's all about god knowing that we are going to be saved and predestinating us to be saved then you don't even because i know there is is [Applause] places straight and i will break in pieces the gates of brass and cut in sand at the bars of iron and i will give thee the treasures of darkness and the hidden reaches of the secret places that thou mayest know that i the lord which called thee by thy name i'm the god of israel verse four for jacob my servant is sick and the israel might elect i have even called thee by thy name i have surnamed thee that thou hast though thou hast known me all right i am the lord and there is none else there is no god beside me i guarded thee though that has not known me all right brother can you read until us [Music] that they may know from the rising verse 6 from the rising of the sun and from the west and there is none else beside me i am the lord and there is none else verse seven i form the light and create darkness i make peace and create evil i the lord do all these things [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] mother of all life now please listen all living here the good and the bad it remains the evil and the righteous the seed of god and the seed of the seeds there is two seeds in the world in the world today is the seed of god my mind the seed of the suffering no matter what you do since you're choking has because there's [Applause] there is is is is see what this person will be they could see their heart yeah he knew who they are so he chose them he elected them before these people did anybody um you before the foundation now cuts he says agamba i'm going to most of the service i'll be reading the quote from the message the faith of abraham and let me it says and predestination is a hard word among a congregation of people because predestination really for knowledge is is a better word against [Music] nation looks back to foreign [Music] he predestinated [Music] it says something to which a person or a thing is destined cover often hell to be and listen to this irresistible power it's like an irresistible power gagarin did you hear that that's really an irresistible power destiny taker so can we now run it through again amen all right god cartoon foreign and because if one of you is he predestinated you now now [Music] your destiny something god had seen in you matter oh my how many waves will come here i knew there was within amen i believe they believe it because they can't the only way this man can run away the only resistance the devil has to make us not get in contact with the word hallelujah [Applause] when i see people drinking my heart just yeah wait wait go to jail when i see people fornicating i feel like oh god that is my life my brother be careful you have [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] oh is and we find out that man to the man that he created just like him let me tell you something never blame anyone for whatever happens to you in your life whatever happens to you in your life it is because of your own decisions because of your own choices the choices that you make you what you are doing [Applause] [Music] let me give you how many were there 500 the bible says [Music] [Applause] whatever [Applause] his name is you didn't even kill his wife at one point and i'll give you reasons for that one point judas yoda was among the disciples who went out to customers and they came back excited yes said why are you excited oh jesus because the demons are running away do we agree that judas's name was on the book of life do you agree with him was on the book of life and still betrayed jesus and somebody said oh he was a bad man betrayed jesus because he was an unbeliever yesterday actually believed in jesus more than the rest to you directly it is a numeration of sin because he had seen the power of jesus he had seen what jesus could do he had seen him go through people when they wanted to throw him [Music] he really knew that's my money even if he goes and gets the money to nobody again that jesus can still just go through those people he knows how my god is great that jesus was more powerful to you you know just to god yes judas was different from peter you died because peter peter was thinking that jesus may be you know taken and so we have to fight that yes i'll take the money can you send me but also my jesus yeshua i want to know oh what [Applause] uh [Music] while he was thinking those things nachos jesus took the ear yes from the ground over and he put it back on this man and the ear went back and peter [Music] saw the chickens let me check back at the moment i thought i could distract my deal they are believers like those kids what's your choices that you make in your life when so those of you who don't want to repent because you are saying against that you should not watch the choices that you make you are being predecimated do whatever you want to do oh glory follow me closely now please you have to give me this question people can follow me now amen in the beginning knew the end from the beginning that is why he even told judas he is the same god who picked an elected judas catholic that is why we should not take it for granted you should be happy because of that that god being infinite in the beginning near the end from the beginning he knew what people would do yeah so he would tell what would take place are you following me are you following knew the choices he knew that judas would make a choice to betray him yeah he wasn't willing that essa would that is [Applause] you know uh what is it called you know delhi so they're two living idols no matter whether you knew a new esl or you knew jacob it is the choices they met [Applause] my choice shall i walk god knew you would receive him catholic and therefore no rachel elected him no and if you want to be rich and if indeed he knows he will do them he david because god knew the choices of david wagon you would see how david is praying and crying he knew his imperfections [Music] [Music] the [Applause] me they are honest this man was speaking with all his heart from the second hero he didn't just come after sinning he said god had done that thank you for electing [Applause] he confessed his sin today believe us jesus after allah okay i'll finish i finished with this quote but i want to first go a little bit longer here now for us to get a whole view now so that's how he knows us today he knows us by the choices we make uh he chose me but i had to make a choice yes i accept jesus that is the choice yes i make a choice to leave for the girlfriends yes i make a choice so you might be able to fool god knows your heart you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you you will never be able to fool god because he knows your heart hallelujah hallelujah praise the name of the lord he knows your heart genesis unto the woman ye shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day that ye if thereof when your eyes then your eyes shall be opened and he shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also to her husband with her and he did it [Music] she calls the man to leave his place too much and i want to speak for just a minute to those of you who are married in marriage the devil has no access in your said you have a fortune then the devil will attack that let me tell you you may say what is my place the lord has told you in his word submit yourself [Applause] [Music] those things which you feel are not appropriate for you to submit to your world your husband is your own body you have no opinion over run [Applause] is looking amen for women who will submit to their husbands in all things but a woman shouldn't leave that position the church that's why a genuine brother who loves his wife can never lay his hand upon both of them have left their place for them before we are in the same way when eve left her place her place was to obey what her husband told her [Music] but another man of god we should stay in our places too if she fell to the trap now category and she left her place another forge and she fell to the track now what momentum came in eve is not supple since we're standing but she's seen now yeah you know because of our choices the devil tried his best standing up for nature the only thing he would have done i'm sorry i want [Music] today what time is it all right it's 12 26 but by now usually i should finish but if i finish now i'm leaving this topic halfway how many give me more 20 minutes you remember when he called him out there and he said he would not keep the thing as separate from him when he was going to destroy sodom and gomorrah he said foreign himself i know that abraham would send this message on down from one generation to the other but god [Music] hallelujah when god elects you is electing you so that his purpose in you can be accomplished without note that you are good hallelujah do you accept what you're curious you agree you agree okay goddess purpose in your life right amen but you just couldn't no you wanted to as i said the other night make a pig believe is wrong eating slop you can't tell a pig it is wrong by eating slow dosage no matter how bad he would it would it would leak never record it yeah she would only brighten it up so if you are supplemented even if you try to make yourself remain the way i don't are actually the sports of righteousness you don't want to reform or do a little better you've got to be changed completely inside [Applause] i will never file hallelujah am i it will work out see your color why why because there is a nature inside i have a change in me up a little bit up a little bit it says up up up up yes now you go to get that right and that is what has to be born again now let me put a comma there another full can you make them what is going to be born again [Music] look he said go down up up up yes can you all see that he says can you highlight but get it right inside at the beginning get it right inside right walk on it get it right that right don't take that off and i want you to listen to this now the prophet of god is saying here this is what we have to get right now it is that which was in the image of god at the beginning [Music] against the girl will have no choice but to move on right with it i didn't i'll just finish commandeering with with a look a little bit look at romans 8. okay we have already read it 828. according to his perspective now listen to this as we take it down moody is there any longer too many desert whom he did for now did for and all uh he also did predestination so what is number one before up up foreign up a little bit verse 20 28 28. he says that for all things work together for good for those that are called according for those who love the lord and are called according to his purpose [Music] now are you following me now now what does predestination do predestination he predestinated you [Music] that's why we read the scripture which says beloved now now are we the sons of god now after he predestinated you then he also called you he called me because i knew i would even bring forth the image of jesus christ because he knew you would bring forth the image of christ he didn't call you to look like the world they acquitted from an anger to bring forth the image of the eyes and because he called you he said to them who he called peter he also justified justified i'm justified i have not done it in the first place i'm justified in the first place some justify
