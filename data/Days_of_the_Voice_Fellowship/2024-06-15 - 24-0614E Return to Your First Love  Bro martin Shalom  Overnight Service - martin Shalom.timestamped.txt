[47:52] time uh these are the thing this is the
[47:55] prophecy which was proph propes
[47:58] side and remember when Jesus after here
[48:02] Jesus was talking to the
[48:04] disciple and still it was telling us
[48:08] about this day that we are living in
[48:10] amen we are living in the time where
[48:14] things are moving it's like the world is
[48:17] upside down praise be to God we are
[48:21] living the Harvest
[48:22] Time on the other other side it's a good
[48:26] time time for the bride but it's also a
[48:29] dark time to the world and also we
[48:32] living in the time where there are a lot
[48:33] of things happening but unless we keep
[48:36] ourself with the word we may end up
[48:39] missing the mark blessed be the name of
[48:41] the Lord and where we have read here in
[48:45] Revelation uh we are seeing
[48:49] when God was speaking the Church of
[48:53] Ephesus and was telling them
[48:57] reminding
[48:58] them uh to return to their first love
[49:02] blessed be the name of the Lord amen you
[49:05] know the first love brother bam refers
[49:09] it
[49:11] uh he say something about the first love
[49:14] in this
[49:15] message let me start with that quote
[49:22] [Music]
[49:36] looking for that
[49:48] quote praise the Lord
[50:00] he says in the message uh in the resume
[50:03] of the ages that is in church ede
[50:06] book uh I think that's chapter 10 it
[50:09] says that uh the the true church had
[50:13] lost it his first love that love was typ
[50:19] filed as the love of bride and groom at
[50:24] their marriage
[50:27] and ear
[50:29] years of wedding
[50:31] life blessed be the name of the Lord the
[50:35] love we are reading here in
[50:38] Revelation the prophet says uh that that
[50:46] love he says that under the angel of the
[50:49] churches of Ephesians write this things
[50:51] says the he that hold the Seven Stars in
[50:53] his right hand who walth in the midst of
[50:56] the seven golden Candlestick I Know Thy
[50:58] works and thy labor and thy patience and
[51:02] how thou can not bear them which are
[51:06] evil and thou Hast tried
[51:09] them H which say they are Apostles and
[51:13] are not and has form them liar and thou
[51:16] has born and H has patience for my
[51:20] name's sake hast thou labored and hast
[51:22] thou not fainted nevertheless I have
[51:25] somewhat against thee
[51:27] because thou Hast lost thy left thy
[51:30] first love
[51:32] amen they had left their first love
[51:36] blessed be the name of the Lord in the
[51:38] prophet here says that the church had
[51:40] lost its first
[51:42] love that love was typified as the love
[51:47] of the bride and the groom at their
[51:50] marriage and their early years of
[51:53] wedding
[51:54] life there was a c knowing of that
[51:58] complete love and the abandonment to God
[52:03] blessed be the name of the Lord and as
[52:05] we are checking ourself tonight I don't
[52:07] know how it is with you the love you
[52:09] used to have for the word the love you
[52:12] used to have for Fellowship the love you
[52:15] used to have amen that love which used
[52:18] to make you go pray and fast go in the
[52:21] bush amen seeking for the presence of
[52:24] God is that love love still
[52:27] there because here where we read in
[52:30] Matthew he told us that
[52:34] because iniquity shall abound the love
[52:39] of many shall Works
[52:41] cold here Jesus was addressing
[52:45] Believers blessed be the name of the
[52:47] Lord and where we read in Revelation it
[52:50] says repent and go back to the first
[52:54] love praise be to God
[52:57] the only way we can get out of that
[52:59] condition is through
[53:01] repentance we repent and we start
[53:04] arresh praise the
[53:08] Lord repentance bring the healing of the
[53:11] body and even the healing of the
[53:14] Soul when Christian repent when
[53:18] Believers repent that brings Revival
[53:21] amen the only thing that can bring
[53:24] Revival in our midst in our lives in our
[53:28] homes in our families it is
[53:31] repentance blessed be the name of the
[53:34] Lord we repent and we go back to the
[53:37] first
[53:38] love
[53:41] amen return you must Return To Your
[53:44] First
[53:46] Love First Love Has a lot praise be to
[53:52] God in 1 Thessalonians 5: 21 1 to 22 it
[53:58] says 21 say that prove all things hold
[54:04] fast that which is
[54:08] good prove all things and hold fast that
[54:13] which is good blessed be the name of the
[54:15] Lord you see the first love has
[54:18] something to do with a
[54:20] Zeal Talk of the hunger for the word
[54:23] talk of The Thirst blessed be the name
[54:26] of the
[54:27] Lord the moment The Thirst is not there
[54:31] the moment that hunger for the word for
[54:34] righteousness is not there my brother my
[54:38] sister we are getting
[54:41] nowhere but here he says
[54:46] remember you know each in Christian walk
[54:51] we know it's a
[54:52] journey we came from Egypt we are going
[54:56] through the Wilderness and we are moving
[54:59] to the promised land amen and alongside
[55:02] this journey there are many challenges
[55:04] along the way because when Jesus called
[55:07] us he never told us even when he called
[55:10] the Israelites he only told them about
[55:12] the promised land he never mentioned
[55:15] about the FR tribes in the wilderness he
[55:18] never told them about the Red Sea praise
[55:21] be to God so they were supposed to look
[55:24] at the promised land because that that
[55:26] is what God was showing them God knew
[55:29] that this other thing is just a minor
[55:31] thing he would fight their battles he
[55:34] would help them in delivery he would set
[55:37] them free he would give them Victory he
[55:39] would give them light by night and by
[55:42] day blessed be the name of the Lord so
[55:45] their main theme was to focus on the
[55:49] journey and as long as that first love
[55:52] is there serving God becomes so sweet
[55:56] that's when you sing and you say the
[55:57] more you serve him the sweeter he
[56:00] becomes so he grows amen but when we
[56:04] reach a point when coming to church is a
[56:07] burden there is something wrong
[56:09] somewhere praise be to God that is a
[56:13] that is a sign of
[56:17] danger when you reach a time when church
[56:20] is boring you brother sister you are
[56:22] dying you are in a dying state
[56:28] when worship become a
[56:31] problem you just know that you are dying
[56:35] praise be to God but God warned us about
[56:40] this generation we are living in and
[56:42] Jesus told them because iniquity shall
[56:44] abound
[56:52] [Applause]
[56:56] praise be to God we are living in the
[56:59] time where the wrong is the right and
[57:01] the right is the
[57:04] wrong brother samel says that the things
[57:08] which used to be done in dungeons they
[57:12] are now in open
[57:15] place
[57:17] amen we are living in the time where you
[57:20] find prostitutes on the streets during
[57:23] in fact in broad daylight
[57:29] where you find young people drinking in
[57:32] Broad day
[57:35] light this is the day we are living in
[57:38] we are living in the time where Satan
[57:41] has trips women naked their stpes naked
[57:46] until nakedness has become a
[57:50] fashion why because iniquity shall
[57:53] abound
[57:56] and the Same Same Spirit has even crept
[57:59] into the
[58:01] church praise be to
[58:03] God people are no longer mining about
[58:07] serving
[58:10] God it's like nobody's concern at
[58:14] all it's like some we just come maybe to
[58:18] please others or paying a visits to
[58:21] others where is the problem we have lost
[58:24] the first love
[58:28] praise be to
[58:29] God where is that Zeal you used to
[58:34] have when you used to be here 2 hours
[58:37] before the service
[58:40] starts where are the men and women who
[58:43] used to pray amen spend the whole night
[58:46] on their
[58:49] knees where are those young men and
[58:52] women praise be to God
[58:56] who used to worship God even when they
[58:58] are walking they are singing worship to
[59:01] God what
[59:04] happened if you check if you look at
[59:08] yourself how are you
[59:12] standing blessed be the name of the
[59:22] Lord Philippians 4:8 says that finally
[59:25] brethren whatever things are true
[59:28] whatever things are honest whatever
[59:31] things are just whatever things are pure
[59:35] whatever things are lovely whatever
[59:39] things are of good report if there be
[59:42] any virtue and if there be any praise
[59:47] think on these
[59:51] things praise be to God think oh on
[59:56] those
[1:00:00] things praise be to
[1:00:07] God
[1:00:10] repent and go back to your first
[1:00:13] love the only way back is
[1:00:22] repentance it's later than we think
[1:00:24] according to scriptures and what we
[1:00:27] sing the time is at
[1:00:30] hand and this comes to an
[1:00:33] individual it is individual
[1:00:37] Affair praise be to God the
[1:00:40] determination begins with
[1:00:44] you no one is going to force you the
[1:00:48] ministers will
[1:00:50] Minister preachers will preach the word
[1:00:53] but brother it's up to you to work
[1:00:58] up because if Jesus said that because
[1:01:00] iniquity shall aband the love of many
[1:01:03] shall Works cold Check Your Love Is Your
[1:01:07] Love growing or is working cold or it's
[1:01:10] getting cold every single
[1:01:13] day and how do I
[1:01:16] know look at the love you have for the
[1:01:19] word for Fellowship for Brethren amen
[1:01:24] that seal to ser
[1:01:27] God that still to seek for his
[1:01:30] presence for the Bible says that I love
[1:01:33] those who love me and those who seek me
[1:01:35] early they shall find
[1:01:37] me in samel Jesus said that because I
[1:01:41] called you and you will not answer you
[1:01:44] will call me and I will not answer you
[1:01:49] in that time is coming amen so we better
[1:01:53] seek God
[1:01:54] now because the time is coming when the
[1:01:58] church WIll weep when the church will
[1:02:00] pray when the church WIll fast when
[1:02:02] preachers will preach and God will not
[1:02:09] answer praise be to
[1:02:12] God when the Rapture will take place
[1:02:16] banam tells us foolish virgin will keep
[1:02:20] [Music]
[1:02:23] on they will not even know
[1:02:26] that Rapture has
[1:02:29] occurred how will you
[1:02:37] know praise be to God Daniel was
[1:02:43] connected are you connected

[1:02:52] your
[1:02:54] day do you you know the promises of your
[1:02:58] day are you seeking for the Holy
[1:03:04] Ghost remember the foolish
[1:03:07] virgin the the prophet tells us all of
[1:03:10] them were a virgin they were not
[1:03:13] defiled but what made what made the
[1:03:15] difference was one the foolish
[1:03:18] virgin they were virgin they also had
[1:03:23] oil in their lamps
[1:03:26] but they had extra
[1:03:29] oil praise be to God because when they
[1:03:32] tmed their
[1:03:48] lamp praise be to God that's why we
[1:03:51] should not we should never lose that
[1:03:53] first love
[1:04:03] but in the message in Lan Church AG say
[1:04:06] that the city was rich Endor by wealth
[1:04:09] it was full of CES
[1:04:13] science abounded how like today the
[1:04:17] churches are
[1:04:19] rich the worship is beautiful and
[1:04:22] formal but C and
[1:04:28] dead and this is what we are seeing
[1:04:35] today churches have good
[1:04:39] music they sing like
[1:04:42] Angels but dry like
[1:04:49] Stone they are formal but cold and dead
[1:04:53] culture and education have taken the
[1:04:56] place of the spirit given
[1:04:59] word and faith has been s has
[1:05:03] been
[1:05:05] surpassed by science so that man is a
[1:05:09] victim of
[1:05:12] materialism blessed be the name of the
[1:05:15] Lord men they have become the victim of
[1:05:20] materialism we are living in a time

[1:09:12] homes it's good to go on the YouTube and

[1:39:52] church God has no
[1:39:56] grandchildren Pentecostal we used to
[1:39:58] think that Pentecostal they think they
[1:40:00] the but it is now becoming terrible
[1:40:03] message Believers think that God's
[1:40:08] grandchildren because we have the
[1:40:10] message because we read the seals
[1:40:12] because we read the church ages we know
[1:40:14] the book of Exodus we know this and
[1:40:17] think now so Brethren let a Kill
[1:40:24] blessed be the name of the Lord but
[1:40:27] Jesus said when the spirit that raised
[1:40:30] Christ from the dead dwelleth in us he
[1:40:34] will Quicken our moral
[1:40:36] bodies we need the quickening power the
[1:40:40] quickening power will restore us it will

[1:40:49] the name of the
[1:40:50] Lord amen I'm a about to finish just in
[1:40:55] I'm
[1:41:03] finishing but mam says in this
[1:41:14] message if you don't have a church you
[1:41:16] must see you will die spiritually you
[1:41:20] will just drle away you need church we
[1:41:25] must be in
[1:41:29] church even when you at school s God
[1:41:32] bless you you struggle say at least I
[1:41:34] must be there she stays in muko but she
[1:41:37] struggles she
[1:41:39] fight to see that she comes around to be
[1:41:42] an ego of God you have got to follow the
[1:41:45] word day by
[1:41:47] day you have got to continue feed upon
[1:41:51] the word not only following
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:00] it we must
[1:42:10] feed day by day
[1:42:32] the Lord is my
[1:42:37] shepherd it is because we don't read the
[1:42:44] word we used to be in church even up to
[1:42:48] date when the pastor is preaching all
[1:42:50] the word is going on you some sometimes
[1:42:53] you get nuggets and but because when you
[1:42:56] look at future you look at
[1:43:01] yourself that's why you sit you cross
[1:43:03] your leg and even
[1:43:11] Slumber stay
[1:43:13] connected let us be
[1:43:16] tuned and when it comes to Young the
[1:43:19] good thing our church is for young
[1:43:20] people I'm also young to go
[1:43:47] AI will not take you to
[1:43:49] heaven it is the holy ghost that will
[1:43:51] take you to heaven
[1:43:54] Jesus said that when the Holy Ghost is
[1:43:56] come he will bring this thing into our
[1:43:58] remember he will teach us not
[1:44:15] a brother sister let us eat the word day
[1:44:20] by day
[1:44:36] and yet we are told here every
[1:44:39] day someone in the like they are flooded
[1:44:42] over the
[1:44:43] YouTube we are listening
[1:44:46] to teaching and preaching here and from
[1:44:49] other
[1:44:51] Fellowship as this still
[1:45:02] that's why in the church that's why in
[1:45:05] the churches is getting cold and cooling
[1:45:09] of it is because we have been
[1:45:10] indifferent toward
[1:45:12] God we have been this is true the church
[1:45:16] has been indifferent toward
[1:45:19] God we take things for granted
[1:45:23] worship we just give
[1:45:26] like half bed
[1:45:32] worship but not until we know that we
[1:45:36] are serving
[1:45:38] God blessed be the name of the
[1:45:41] Lord but bam tells us in this same
[1:45:44] message Lan Church age that he want you
[1:45:47] ready
[1:45:48] h of
[1:45:51] Reason beginning from tonight are you
[1:45:54] going to be ready hot or you're going to
[1:45:56] be freezing
[1:46:50] brother but when it comes to God's
[1:47:00] courtroom it is the opposite
[1:47:25] he want you ready hot or freezing one
[1:47:28] one or other don't be look
[1:47:31] warm just don't pretend something that
[1:47:34] you haven't
[1:47:36] got
[1:47:40] amen if you know you have not gotten any
[1:47:43] experience brother be that cry to God to
[1:47:47] give you an experience
[1:48:01] and that is
[1:48:03] true I've seen people
[1:48:05] falling someone Falls and tell you you
[1:48:08] feel like the person
[1:48:13] has the prophet is warning is telling us

[1:48:20] that you have not got either
[1:48:23] be on fire for God or go on

[1:53:43] spirit is a a very is a a is a god of
[1:53:46] order he's a god of order I was
[1:53:50] a uh for the past maybe 1 hour or two
[1:53:54] with a certain young man you know
[1:53:56] sharing the word
[1:53:58] and uh the things that I was
[1:54:02] sharing we came here for the last 20
[1:54:04] minutes we've been listening he can tell
[1:54:07] it is exactly what we were talking you
[1:54:12] know even the subject going back to the
[1:54:15] first return to the first love and you
[1:54:17] know most of the things that have been
[1:54:19] said I believe God will speaking to him
[1:54:21] and reconfirming that but I believe God
[1:54:24] has been speaking to all of
[1:54:25] us and so thank you for coming to church
[1:54:28] God bless each of you uh uh may God
[1:54:32] bless each of you and give us a
[1:54:33] wonderful time in his presence for the
[1:54:36] time we are going to be in prayer now
[1:54:37] before we go to prayer I just wanted
[1:54:40] to I don't know whether Brother Martin I
[1:54:42] was not here when the service was
[1:54:43] beginning whether he has uh uh announced
[1:54:47] it he did yeah maybe I just wanted to
[1:54:50] give you a little backround being that I
[1:54:52] will not be here on Sunday when the
[1:54:53] Believers will be uh informed the
[1:54:56] details as well brother Brian is one of
[1:55:00] those brothers that uh you know joined
[1:55:02] our church not long ago maybe about a
[1:55:05] year now but he's been very consistent
[1:55:08] consistently coming to the fellowship uh
[1:55:11] he was a Believer when he came you know
[1:55:13] from his home but uh I think along the
[1:55:17] way he spent a long time around here
[1:55:19] without fellowship and he he back sleep
[1:55:23] and uh that's when I think he got this
[1:55:25] sister also at that time she was not a
[1:55:28] Believer so she believed actually from
[1:55:30] this church and uh so he came back with
[1:55:34] her and then she believed here and she
[1:55:36] was baptized here and well he told me we
[1:55:39] have been living together for a while we
[1:55:41] even expecting a child I said well you
[1:55:44] do not have to separate from her do
[1:55:47] people know that you have her she he
[1:55:49] said yes her people know that I have her
[1:55:52] but they demanded that I I fulfill ABC D
[1:55:55] then we can get married so I told him
[1:55:58] well before God you already husband and
[1:56:00] wife and I don't think it is necessary
[1:56:01] for you to separate from her butth we
[1:56:03] can arrange after you have fulfilled
[1:56:06] your requirements then we can arrange
[1:56:08] for you to uh to be married off
[1:56:11] officially so um they were expecting
[1:56:14] this child and they were very happy you
[1:56:16] know to have the child but unfortunately
[1:56:19] as you old I I think I don't know
[1:56:21] whether this detail was given but uh
[1:56:24] they went to the first hospital you know
[1:56:27] the the child was um they was telling
[1:56:30] saying that they going to operate the
[1:56:31] sister but uh it looked like it it would
[1:56:35] not work out they would need to operate
[1:56:37] her but by God's grace when they went to
[1:56:40] another hospital of course with your
[1:56:42] prayers uh she was able to give birth
[1:56:44] normally and everybody was happy now I
[1:56:47] do not know maybe that Dr M has more
[1:56:49] details on that on why but uh I was told
[1:56:53] that it appears the child had
[1:56:56] complications during the time of birth
[1:56:58] and U swallowed some you know water
[1:57:02] whatever and and so I do not know
[1:57:05] whether the hospital there it's a
[1:57:06] government hospital I don't know whether
[1:57:07] they did not understand what had
[1:57:09] happened so they were putting the child
[1:57:11] on on oxygen but when the child was
[1:57:13] taken to another hospital which is now a
[1:57:15] bigger hospital that's where they were
[1:57:17] able to discover because the child had
[1:57:19] not actually breast fed since she was
[1:57:21] born that's where they were able to
[1:57:23] discover
[1:57:25] that actually it has not been just a
[1:57:30] breathing problem it was what was
[1:57:32] swallowed so that's when they when they
[1:57:34] cleaned out the child and everything
[1:57:37] became normal actually Brother Martin
[1:57:39] spoke to the brother was it yesterday is
[1:57:42] Brother Martin there
[1:57:44] yesterday yeah and the brother was very
[1:57:47] happy brother was there at the hospital
[1:57:48] the brother was very happy oh now the
[1:57:50] baby's feeding for the first time and
[1:57:53] the mother is Happy the father is happy
[1:57:54] so it seemed everything had normalized
[1:57:56] now and I think a few hours then later
[1:58:00] you know the the the Lord accepted that
[1:58:03] the child would be taken away from them
[1:58:06] so certain things we understand certain
[1:58:08] things we don't but we know that it's
[1:58:10] God the oth of life and it's God who
[1:58:12] takes it so at this time we need to
[1:58:15] stand with this young uh young people
[1:58:18] and young couple and you know support
[1:58:20] them it could be you it could be your
[1:58:22] brother is our brother here she's our
[1:58:25] sister here so we need to stand with
[1:58:27] them with the best we can
[1:58:30] do uh they are going very far
[1:58:33] away um I think the name was given on
[1:58:36] the
[1:58:38] group uh the name where they're going to
[1:58:41] do the barrial from it's um in Northern
[1:58:44] Uganda uh I see it's called a Leong that
[1:58:47] is after leader actually you know it's
[1:58:50] quite far so they need a a lot of money
[1:58:52] I was told over
[1:58:54] 500,000 so we need to give if possible
[1:58:57] to give all of it you know just support
[1:58:59] them and show them solidarity and love
[1:59:02] so I don't know how but I think this can
[1:59:05] be told again on Sunday myself brother
[1:59:08] Isaac and maybe a few of my family
[1:59:10] members we shall be away to Miana but on
[1:59:14] Sunday it will be told again and those
[1:59:15] of us who are here we shall have a bag
[1:59:18] when we are exiting so that you just
[1:59:20] give whatever you can give if you don't
[1:59:22] don't have money physically you can send
[1:59:24] on the number Brother Martin posted it
[1:59:25] on the uh on the on the on the group or
[1:59:31] you can just send it so that we can give
[1:59:33] as much as we can give to support them
[1:59:41] Amen brother
[1:59:44] Ivan sorry I did not hear that
[1:59:49] yes he decided to travel finally
[2:00:03] yeah initially we had planned that
[2:00:05] brother Ivan travels with him and as a
[2:00:07] church would sponsor brother Ivan to at
[2:00:09] least go on our behalf and you know
[2:00:11] Comfort the brother brother martin has
[2:00:13] ever gone through this kind of saga lost
[2:00:15] a child so he understands what it means
[2:00:18] uh so again we had canceled because of
[2:00:21] the of the
[2:00:22] finances that means it will even be now
[2:00:24] more expensive the money I mentioned is
[2:00:26] actually lesser so that means we really
[2:00:29] have to if brother Ivan is deciding
[2:00:31] finally to uh escort the brother up to
[2:00:34] Alon we need to really uh support him
[2:00:38] also uh on our behalf because he's
[2:00:40] representing us
[2:00:42] there so while we go to prayer we also
[2:00:45] remember that couple praise God praise
[2:00:49] the Lord yes it is a sad thing but uh we
[2:00:53] just remember them and pray that God
[2:00:56] sustains them and while they go through
[2:00:58] the trial that God will strengthen there
