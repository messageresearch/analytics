welcome God bless you amen we happy to have you here to amen and there's a Bosworth family is also here with us this [Music] morning right over here and your wife is sister can you raise up your hand bless happy to be with you this morning amen if you could please turn with me to the Book of John chapter 6 we are reading from vers one we are beginning from verses one and we shall read until verse [Music] 15 so let me read it in English if you are following in your Bible you can just follow [Music] along after these things Jesus went out over the Sea of Galilee which is the Sea of tiberias and a great multitude followed him because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased and Jesus went up into the mountain and there sat he sat with his disciples and a Passover a feast of the Jews was now when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company come unto him he said unto them he said unto philli whence shall we buy bread that these may eat and he said he said to prove to prove him uh for he himself knew what he would do Philip answered him 200 pen worth of bread is not sufficient for them that every one of them may take a little one of the of his disciples Andrew Simon Peter's brother said unto him there is a lad here which has five b Loaves and two fish small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus said make the men sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in the number about 5,000 and Jesus Took the Loaves and when he had given thanks he distributed to the disciples and the disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fish uh the fishes as much as they would when they were filled he said unto the disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five body loaves which remained over and above unto them that had eaten um then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world when Jesus therea perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone amen am amen you may be seated Amen Let us also read uh John chapter 6 verse 63 the same chapter verse and uh we will read it in luganda in English from the time from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with [Music] him then said Jesus unto the 12 will you also go away then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go that has the words of eternal life and we believe and assure that thou art that Christ the son of the Living God Amen amen praise the name of the Lord I'd like to speak on the subject to whom shall we go to whom ask your neighbor to whom shall we go um I do not expect to be long as usual but when he is done then I'll be done and and he will Grant to us as much as we desire this morning according to our needs so now we we see here friends in the portion of scripture that we have read we shall read a little more later in just a moment we'll continue to read from verse 47 but we see here that Jesus started his ministry with only a few disciples and and we I'm sorry I'm just going straight into the word this morning how many are ready for the word we are ready you know sometimes we are used to Long preliminaries and speeches and talks but this morning I feel I have a lot on my heart to share with you and so I just want to go straight the rest shall come afterwards we should be ready to say Amen right away amen I'm happy to see different ones of you course and I love all of you amen but we love him more than anything so Jesus started his ministry with only a few disciples and his ministry and influence grew and it began to attract many other people and they began to join him because I remember when he was baptized on the on the River Jordan by uh by uh John he was only alone but after that water baptism he began to walk and his ministry you know he called 12 disciples he only called 12 and even among the ones that he directly called not everyone was a genuine believer you know he actually said that didn't called 12 of you and one of you was a devil and so because Judas did not believe but he was called so now you see the 12 disciples but you see Judas was also called for a purpose and that's why I say that whenever a child of God is called by God you are called for a purpose but I want to be called for a good purpose I want to be a v of horor in the presence of God amen as he says in the word you know in the house there are many vessels there vess of horon and vessel of Dison and you see but you see in all they his vessels you know you can say that Pharaoh was his vessel you know you can say that Judas was his vessel you know you can say Cain was his vessel you can say all these were God is vessel but you see in a way it comes to to a point whereby we cannot explain some things because I tell you what there are certain things that we canot be able to explain as human beings and I believe there is no one single human being can say that he's know it all even our Prophet by the BR he never knew all things I'm sorry to disappoint you if you thought he did in some things he actually said I don't know and so you see things that are revealed are for us and our children and things that are not revealed they are forgot and so for as much as he chooses to reveal to us that we receive that we accept and that we make part of our life and what it doesn't choose to reveal to us if he says it we believe it and that settles it whether we understand it or not how many understand that and so we see there have many vels in his house and so vels of honor and vs Of Dishonor and even Judas was a vessel and even you are a vessel but what kind of vessel are you in his house I want to be a vessel of horor I want to be used for the POS I want to be used to influence others POS and his ministry and influence of Jesus's Ministry rather it grew with time after he called the 12 this is all he called and then he began to move from place to place with them and his ministry began to be um you know began to fulfill his his purpose he began to raise the dead he began to Open the Eyes of the blind he began to set free the captives he began to move in the lives of people and lives of people were changed because of his ministry but we see after a while his ministry now began to pull multitudes as we saw in verse two he says a great multitude followed him he was going in a mountain he was going to sit with his disciples and maybe teach them but along the way a crowd a multitude followed him he never called them he never begged them but they followed him because they needed him the reason for a good following was what that's the question today we have many people following Jesus in the world today we have many forms of Christianity today we have many preachers who are preaching Christianity but the question is why are they following Jesus why are you following Jesus ask your neighbor why are you following Jesus why are you ask them now brother why are you following Jesus do you know why ask yourself why am I following Jesus and until you know why you're following him you will not know what kind of vessel you are so when he went to a mountain these people came following him but why were they following him they were not following him because amen of what of the reason why he came in the world where you may say the reason why Jesus came in the world was to heal the sick was to heal the lamb was to Open the Eyes of the blind was to perform Miracles but I'll tell you he came for more than that he came for more than that Jesus came to bring life Jesus was the bread of life and he came down from heaven to come and die for our sins he came to bring Salvation he was the word that brings life down the Earth but when many followed him in that first poool of his ministry they were not interested in the word they were interested in the Miracles and today you see all the mega churches they call it look at all the mega CH why are they following it is because there is a man who is supposedly doing Miracles they have promised them come and see your Miracle come receive your Miracle the man of God will anoint you and you will receive your mirac so now it's it's a following after Miracles all right right now when he went into the mountain still a great company followed him he still knew what they needed they needed food and as long as Jesus distributed to their needs they received him now this is this is quite ironical because when they received him they received him as somebody who gave them food but by receiving him as someone who gave them food they accepted him as a prophet and they accepted him as a king I want you to look at this take a moment to Think Jesus had not yet told them why he came he had not even revealed himself to them well but they because they saw food you know when Jesus was on the mountain with the disciples and he saw the mud he turned to Philip he said Philip Brother Martin where's brother says brother sister Rose sister Grace see the people are coming you see the great multitude what shall we feed them this is Jesus the Messiah the one who came to die for the S but he asked Philip the question is did he know what to do the Bible says he knew what he was supposed to do but when he saw them coming he knew these ones are not coming for the word these ones are coming for food my prayer every day is that Lord Lord Des my heart inward parts of my heart you know many people when when they come to God they don't receive him for who he truly is but they receive him for what he has and he knows [Music] and and when they came he knew that right away these ones want food he said tell me Philip what shall we feed them we don't have food in the car what shall we feed them and pH said you know Master oh to feed all these people we will need so much money we will need so much money let me tell you there are many people who have thought it is money that runs a Ministry now let me address this for just a moment money runs the food Ministry but money does not run the word ministry whenever you feel when there is no money you have no Ministry you have nothing to do for to serve the Lord it means you were not called to the word ministry but is a food Ministry with the food Ministry you need money but with a word you only need to speak as God gives you utterance and here he said what shall we fit we need money Philip said we need so much money but Jesus told him and and then someone else came and said but there's this little child some fish and bread and then Jesus you know as the people came came to approach him Jesus told the people brother Alan he said tell all of them to sit so they sat down why do you think they sat down they did not sit down to hear the word they sat down to see what does he have to offer and they sat down and Jesus looked at them he got the small fish and and he prayed over it and after he prayed over it he said serve them as they were sitting down I'm sure they had great expectations something is about something is in store that's what the Christian Church usually expects what is your expect when you came to the message of the hour what is your expectation when you accepted to be baptized if your expectation is wrong if it doesn't match God is word then you know it is wrong and when it is wrong you can never fully attain what God has in store for you time comes when you need to sit down and make an inventory of your life why am I here what am I doing why am I in this church why am I following Jesus why am I even singing why am I doing what I'm doing what is the my expectation what is the desire of my heart what do I want from God these people's hearts not after him they were after what he could do and Jesus knew it and Jesus will give you what you want if you want money he will give you money and that's all so you see we have people today who have specialized in receiving many things from Jesus specialized in receiving money specialized in receiving uh you know gifts and miracles wonders but I'll tell you what this can be typed by the scripture in the Bible where it talks about the girls who are coming today I'm dealing with something a little bit deep and I want you to follow me closely all right give me your attention and so as these girls came King anerus was seated and waiting to find one who would be a true Queen and one by one came and you know you not she would not please the king and she would go away and another one would come and another one would come but hear this whenever a woman came before the presence of the king she was taken from the house of the women but she was never taken back in that house she would not be taken into the house of the cont follow closely now and this woman would go in the house of the cont will never ever come before the presence of the king Uninvited but there is one thing that these women that were in the house of the country they they enjoyed gifts they were spoiled all the time by good things from the from the presence of the king the king gave them whatever they needed you want jewelry yes je you want clo get CL what do you want whatever you need they were given whatever they wanted but they were never to come before the presence of the king because they never pleased the king but let me tell you there is only one woman that was supposed to please the king and that one woman would not be made a but she would also not go back into the house of the women but I tell you where she would go she would go in the inner place she would go in the secret chamber called the place of the queen this was Queen the queen of the whole Kingdom I will tell you a little more about her this one received everything The Other Women received if she wanted but even more she received amen whatever the king had as she would be made queen with the King she would receive the name of the king amen she would you know also come in the presence of the king you remember no one was allowed to come before the presence of the king but Esther was that woman when es was accepted she fasted and prayed If my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray hear amen is the king and Esther amen the bride the wife of the king she fasted and she prayed for three days and nights and then walked before the presence of the king now the king did not deny her there's a song that says I would not be denied I would not be denied if Jesus came and made me whole I would not be because Esther was made whole by the king so when she came everybody was shocked she's going to be king she's going to be how could she walk and interrup the coun and interrupt the king everybody looked but as they looked she continued com she continued work and came right before the king and the King had his golden SE when he would put it up it would mean Mery you were received then you would touch it of I receive I receive your presence accept your presence I accept your acceptance of me and as she walked before the king the king you know looked at her angry but his anger was [Music] pass by something no one else could explain the king and the queen were connected the desire of the queen was not after anything when she was asked what else do you need before you go to the king the first time she said nothing nothing the only thing I want I want to see the king and this Esther walked before king and the King raised his golden and tached as a sign of accept your acceptance of me and at that moment everybody knew the queen was a special lady before the king the queen was accepted amen because our desire was after the king what the King has she was like in her heart I don't want to stay in my chamber with all the gifts from the king with every good thing from the king with all the money with all the cloes with all the good with all the gifts and miracles I want to go before The King and I want to have The King and I want to experience that presence of him and I being one let me tell you we have different groups of people in the economy of God there are some groups which will never be raptured they never going and I'm talking about Christians they are within the kingdom they have been accepted but rejected they're in another chamber they they can receive all the gifts and all the Miracles and all the good things but they dare not come before the presence of the king those who are going to go in the Rapture will be those who will come in the presence of the K but there are many people who have received Grace who have accepted the word the word when I say the word not in its entir they have received portions here portions there and they have rejected other portions and because of that they do not qualify to come up in the Rapture because you can only come up in the Rapture on one basis you can only come in the Rapture on the basis of his Holiness on the basis of his Perfection and that comes only by one thing listen comes by the word because the blood is the word life is in the blood amen the blood is the word my life is the word he says my word is life but there will be some who will accept him who will receive him but not in the entirety of his word because of that they are not perfected but word perfects us we are perfected by the word of God which lives and abides forever that's why the Rapture is for those who have received that Perfection is perfection and they will be the one the B calls them without sport without wrinkle that does not mean that they would have lived spotless but that means because they accept the word because they bow to the they their alance to the they received the word in every situation and they strived to make their calling and election sure and they worked out their salvation with fear and trembling and they because God cared they to care to know what does God want me to do what does the word expect of me what is God's expectation of and because they did that God gave them his perfe their imperfections were made perfect through the world but there will be others which I don't care God is gracious God is merciful and because of that I do whatever I want to do in my way I live in my life I am not bed and I'm still saved well I'm sorry to say but none of those can ever be part of the Rapture cared knew what she wanted had the better reason why she came we find out here in the scripture which we read these people here when they came they were among those who came for food and as Jesus distributed to their needs they said oh this is a prophet he's a prophet he's a mighty prophet and actually the Bible now says down there that when Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by to make him he departed and he ran away from these people love Jesus so much Jesus I love you too much too much how do you love him why do you love him you know you gave me a lot of food you know you're Mir work you know you do so many good things you do wonderful things and because of that I love you you must be my king so listen this is the Christian church today they have accepted Jesus as a king as long as he is giving them what they need the Bible says in the end time we shall have seven women what's the name of this brother over here brother come up can you come up here I pray that yeah I War you Brothers don't doze in church there was a brother who was dozing in church and he was seated and uh the pastor was preaching about um about the Chariot of Fire coming down you know about that brother the of Fire yes and and it says The Chariot is coming down the is coming down and as the Char was coming down you know elishah said oh Master you know give me dou portion of your power and he gave portion of his power and the brother was Seated on the on the chair and there was a carpet like this and he had removed his shoes so his shoes were on the side so when the when the when the pastor was preaching the brother was experiencing everything in the vision and he was seeing himself going in the Chariot and and when he said and then Elijah went and then he woke up he stood up he realized his shoes were not and he says Ah El's gone with my shoes and the brother told him brother youres are here I was not using as an example I called you to make another example the Bible says in the end time there shall be one man brother you married all right say there shall be one man and there will be seven women who will come one man say Mar us accept us as you our husband we want to have your name what's your name want but don't worry we don't want your money we don't want anything that you have we don't want nothing we just want your name and we see that that's the generation we living that's the generation we living in physically speaking but Also spiritually we have because women a woman is a type of a church and we have women today churches today Christians today who say Lord accept us as Christians we are Christians but don't tell us things in the Bible we don't want to do them they very difficult they very hard let us leave our life but accept us as your own as your wife but let me tell you in the mid of all that chaos God has a wife God has a church a spotless church and that church is coming into view the Rapture must happen and there must be a witness praise the name of the Lord and we find that these people they had come only to make him as king but not to obey his Commandments but King because they wanted attachment to him so they can have what they receive from him today we have the same Spirit people go to churches because they're looking for blessings you know on a Sunday they they ask themselves where can we go where shall we find who is Anointed more we hear that that church let us go for some blessing and another Sunday they will find another one they spiritual prostitutes may God help us to stay put that thing is also coming in the message you find people are floting from P to post they can never rest under one Ministry to be to grow when they go under a Ministry it's not because they are willing to submit themselves it is because there's something they want from them you find younger men going to churches to Ser for a while but really their intention is to find a sister there young people you are quiet as if you don't know that's true you will see Brothers saying I from today I'm now a member here but the intention is because there is a GU have seen in that church and after they snatch then you'll never find them again what was their intention you find others coming because they hard there are more blessings flowing there oh because they had when you go there you'll find Opportunities because and so they will be here and when they don't see what they find they go here and they find what they want and then they go there let me tell you we have a generation now that is very very dangerous we in our time which is not many we used to sit under one ministry as long as we are convinced and sure that I believe him to be a man of God and I believe this church is going to help me in my spiritual walk with the Lord and a person will stay put and learn and ask questions and ask to meet the pastor for Spiritual concerns Pastor I want you to pray for me Pastor I'm going through this hardship I had a dream and it is troubling me what can I do about this what does the Bible say about this I was sharing with someone I was challenged can you help me that's what we used to be like but what is this generation going to you know they only come to the pastor when they want money you never see them other time when someone when when you know brother it's coming I want to meet you you know how they want money they will never ask for prayer they will never ask for councel they will never ask for help spiritual help they are not concerned about growing spiritually what is their motive what is their intention their motive and intentions are completely worldly things they are not different from these same people that came to Jesus they did not come to him because he was the Messiah they came to him because they he can do some magic and food will come Miracles will come money will come let us go to and these kind of people how do you know them something small they get offended and they walk away as long as you bring the word and it pierces them they feel they no longer have interest they never walk away with a good testimony they walk away with a negative t why because their first initial motive was wrong may God raise another generation of young people Whose desire is after the word Whose desire after the things of the praise God praise God now these things I am teaching you because these are very important and this is not the kind of sermon that you say Amen to all the time but I will preach it anyhow because there an inspiration that I receive and I'm going to preach it whether you are saying amen or whether you're not saying amen you know it used to be in in in in the early years when a message preacher three things people can't say Amen p and when he preaches the word they get excited amen but now it is becoming the opp let us not back let us go back to the original let us go back to the word of God these people would almost worship their pastors because of physical benefits from them praise God praise God I've seen and I'm seen a lot of this in my many years of ministry it's now more than a decade and this woman that came and you know uh you know in ethopia then and you know she she had many needs well of course we are foreigners usually I don't know why people think that foreigners when they living in a country they have more money than so you know she came the first Sunday said that you know she she was touched and she wanted to be more of the word and you know she's never had things like this before and and you know let me tell you when you when pastors hear those things they feel automatically attached to that person and they want to help them and when they did when when she did were automatically attached myself and my wife was like this is real deal she really interested in the word and the Second Sunday she came with a proposal past I have this business to I had seen already enough of that discouraged I told her sister just keep coming to church all your needs God Will Supply she said amen she never came back she never came back and have many more examples over time and it comes you see most of these churches where pastors are worship I don't care whether it is in the message or out of the message I'm telling you reality to the extent that these people will all literally worship their man of God some of them will even bow oh Pastor I don't know what I've done you think they they are doing that because the man of God has impacted their spiritual life it is because the man of God has invested too much money let me tell you God did not call me to invest money in anyone no I would be a preacher of food the anointing upon me is there not the anointing to distribute food the anointing upon me amen is the anointing to give the word of God every true preacher was not called to be a distributor of Earthly riches and other things that only comes in to support it always comes in to support there is no one person God has ever called and did not equip he equips you with whatever are three things you need but I believe when you come into the ministry or under Min you come to do what that I believe everyone should have a church home you cannot be floting you have to have a church home a place where you call your church but you still fellowship with others but when you call this your church he says for what where you will attend regularly Whenever there is a meeting it is your duty to attend I I'm not interested in your money if you don't attend Services over time I've had people who would who I know can attend services and they don't attend but they they regular payers sometimes I've had to send it back yes because we are not here to to be Tax Collectors it's not your money that I'm interested in it is your soul you have to be ready to surrender to the Lord because you may give your money but if I take your money and you do not put your soul on the line of the word of God I am a thief and a you see these are things that are difficult to say but things that are very very healthy for us from time to time to remind ourselves of these things I believe you know where a place where you go and and support the ca where you attend regularly and you support the C so in other words we are members of church because we are supporting the church we are supporting with our presence and we are supporting with our money and we are supporting whenever need is when we say there is this need come up and support but these days oh it is the opposite young people want to be supported but they never support the work of God why we don't have you don't have because you don't give you see if you give you shall receive I remember when we believe brother Mar you remember that we had too little but we would give whatever we had we were students but out of what we have we would give we would give too little I now remember there was a time I used to give coins in the church that was brutal I now remember that I used to give coin so don't fear to give a coin if that's all you have you're doing your your responsibility and then it's the pastor's Minister's responsibility to turn to your spiritual needs praise the name of the Lord so now these people came down and they sat down and they said pastor Jesus you are now our pastor he said oh am I oh yeah you are now as a matter of fact you are no longer only our Prophet we want to make you King us when he perceived it he he did not accept and later on tables turned after he fed them the after he gave them the Miracles then now he started on his real purpose why he had a calling to them vers 47 I promise we would read that shortly so if you can turn there with me please verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me has everlasting life I am the bread of life your fathers did eat Mana in the wilderness and are dead this is the bread which cometh forth from Heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die in other words I've given you bread but that will make you die and if you ever receive any help or any financial help or any physical help from the ministry that will kill you it's it's not in there is no life that is not the real Ministry and that's what Jesus was trying to tell us and he said I am I am the bread of life verse 51 I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world the Jews that have a strove within themselves how can this man give us flesh to you know when you begin preaching things that are sharp things that are real things that people need to change their lives then they begin to strive within themselves then Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you except you eat of the Flesh of the Son of God and drink his blood he have no life in you praise God what is the what is the blood what the Flesh and and blood of the son of man is the word and the spirit unless you receive the word and be filled with the Holy Ghost you do not have life I know you know many some Ministries do uh what they call um charity Ministry you know building hospitals to help those who cannot pay you for hospital bills Church hospitals or they can offeres and things like that that is not our vision and the reason why it is not is because we are giving something that can give people life real life God will call others to do those other things but we are called Amen in this hour to be the voice of the voiceless to be the voice of life in this generation we are called to bring the word to testify the word to the Sinners if you receive the word and remain a sinner that is your business and I've had so many people who would comfort themselves oh I'm a sinner because so and so is a sinner let me tell you on that day you will give your own account as an individual you may be looking at someone when they are never even ever the bride what about you you have to know your own self you have to be sure of your calling you have to make sure of your calling the Bible says make your calling and election sure let me tell you when I received this message I made a declaration God Mery but I did I said even if my pastor left this message I will believe it you know why because I was convinced that this is the truth and I was ready to give my whole life I was ready to give my entire ambition to give them all up for this message and he did not disappoint me I am standing before you to say he did not disappoint me many came to me and they gave false prophecies they said your life will amount nothing I can tell today my life did not amount to nothing God can never disappoint you if you choose to stand with him God can never disappoint you if you choose to receive the word because this word is life he says I am the bread of life can we say Amen to that and then he continues on to say whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood has eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day for my flesh is me indeed and my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dth in me and I in him and as the living father has sent me and I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me am let us eat Jesus Hallelujah let us eat the word whenever we eat the word we are living by the word by Faith by faith in the Son of God and by faith of the Son of God this is that bread which came down from heaven even he shall live by me this the bread this is the bread which came down from heaven let me tell you we've had people who read the Quran and they said oh it came from Heaven okay let me ask you something do you know how many years the Quran came down whever it came from after Jesus do you know how many years after Jesus it came about I think 500 years 500 years and people are willing to leave this for something that came later I tell you we are standing on Solid Ground this came from Heaven amen it is not even a book it is the man who came down from heaven and he lived but everybody lived he was buried everybody was buried but I tell you he rose again from the he's alive today he's alive in the hearts of the so this is not just a Fe our story it is a living reality Hallelujah this is that bread which came from Heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and dead he that eateth of this bread forever these things said here in the synagogue as he told in cap many there of his disciples when they had heard this they said this is a hard saying who can hear it they walked away when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples M to them does this offend you blessed are you who are not offended at the word hey mhm let me tell you the world is offended at the world and that's why they're doing everything they can to remove this Bible from the hands of men in many places in America you can't even have it in in schools anym because they have rejected God and yet god brother said God blessed America because they stood for the word but now the more they leave the word the more they go down as a nation let me tell you as a human being and as a nation you know you cannot stand without God you look at all the civilizations before us we have many more powerful civilization that were on this world the times of Nebuchadnezzar the median Empire the Roman Empire and all the other empir the Greeks but let me tell you through the whole [Music] time it was God in it all if you read the book of Daniel you will understand that he had already said these kingdoms will rule this world the last Kingdom to come the last Gentile Kingdom to rule in this world I'll tell you what it is is the Roman Kingdom but this time it's going to be mixed with clay and iron with with with protestantism and liberalism and with romanism and this is the last kingdom is going to rule the world the One World Government is coming because the Bible said so and it's going to it's going to rule the whole world but let me tell you they would use religion their first religion and the law they have the power to do that but all these kingdoms all pass away because in the Book of Daniel you know he saw he said I saw amen there was a rock H without hand and he came down and hit this image and what was this image this image was a representation of all the kingdoms of the Gentiles that had lived before but when this rock came down are you hearing me church when this rock came down it smashed this image smash this image and the whole image was reduced to rubble and there was a voice there was a voice the kingdoms of this world has become the kingdom of our God out of his Christ Hallelujah there is coming a time when there will be a new civilization That civilization will be ruled by Christ and his bride with him the Bible say we shall reign with him so don't tell me about any Kingdom power the word has been before all these Kingdom the word has been here through the kingdom the word will be here after this the word will live forever and ever when you talk about Kings you know there's a king that refused to believe in the existence of God God told him I will show you that I exist he made him live like an animal eat grass grow hair grow nails like like an animal until he admitted and that was just an example for to show you it doesn't matter how great a man is in this life is no one greater than God and that's why the devil doesn't like the word he wants to pervert the minds of the generation change the Bible they have written other versions even homosexuals they have written their own Bible even all these other they written their Bible why because they cannot retain God in their knowledge and they came to a place where they agreed within themselves that the god they believe in is not of the word of this Bible but they know there is a God in heaven and they thought to themselves these are just words of a man men wrote them they let us write our own so that when we read them we are not condemned but let me tell you they cannot change the word of God because the word of God is unchangeable the word of God is permanent and it will still condemn them even in hell it will condemn them everywhere they go let me tell you every sinner that sins they are condemned because why the word of God is plac in the hearts of men whereby if you have a conscious your conscious will condemn you but the B says They Se so far away from God their conscious can't condemn them anymore he said their conscious is seared with ir it's just like when someone goes to fornicate the first time they feel like they going to die what have I done and then they get someone to comfort it's all right it's nothing everybody does that and then after a while they're like after all everybody it is okay but the word of God says is not okay and that is eternal all other voices are not and so they were offended at it let us not be offended at the word let us always believe the word there were three pools Jesus's Ministry first the healing of the sick the Miracles then the designment so the healing of the sick the Miracles Drew very many by thousands and then and then the designment but the third pool it was the opening of the word the speaking of the word now that one it took many away but under the third pool that is where the power of change is the power to change is under the third the power to Amen to to to resurrect is under the third pool because the third pool is the opening of the world speaking of the word the third is the word and so we have many ministries Church Ministries operating under the first and second but you are in the message and look at them and know so and Ministry is powerful but is operating under the first healing miracles signs and wonders of but there's a third the ministry of the Bride is a third Ministry is a Ministry of the world what do we find under there Resurrection like in 195 sevenam saw a little fish and God told him you give it life he didn't pray he didn't ask he spoke he said I give you back your life and same that Jesus did that thir Min he spoke Lazarus come Lazarus came you know in Luke 7 he said young man arise and the bible say that he that was dead s that's a thir minen it's a resurrection Ministry what I'm talking about is when you sit under the third pool Ministry the ministry of the world what it does is amen it resurrects you amen we were born dead dead in sins and trespasses but this word resurrects us out of our toss of unbelief TOS of sin Toms of the world and worldliness and when the word of God echoes in your ears it goes through your spirit and goes direct to your soul and then you realize who you are you are like I'm never going back here you turn your back against the world and you take another turn that's the power of the third Min the third pool Ministry creates remember the Min were created three squ I want one here it was and he sh all of them and had a good meal but those squid were not born by other squir it was created of That's The Power of the third same thing that happened in the days of Abraham that lamb which was created in [Music] theck and said turn here's your sacrifice where did that come from it was not born by another sheep did not bear it it was the word of God the word of God created Mary became pregnant what was that it was not the seed of Joseph it was a word of God which created something out of same thing that will do today the power of the thir Min can create something out of nothing hallelujah amen that's the power the cre so when there is nothing in your life it can create something in your life that's why we love the world let me tell you this level is only for a few the third pool Ministry is only for a few it is not for Pentecostal not for denominational followers not for religious people is for the Believers of the world hallelujah amen because the word has power to create and when that power is put in action it comes in you and you become that one and can create life where there has been that's Ministry has power to bring Salvation when brother gave the testimony of the to she said amen that is nothing but the truth I believe it by that moment that moment the power of the third pool Ministry was activated and the prophet spoke to the sister said sister dear ask whatever you want ask whatever you want Hallelujah now if she had asked for a million dollar she would get it whatever she would have asked for let me tell you for God toen Amen put you into that room you would have to know your desires are aligned to his hallelujah amen but she said I won the salvation of My Three Sons Hallelujah and that very moment amen they came one by one falling down repenting of their sins let me tell you you may be a sinner you may be a sinner but if you sit under the power of the world there is power to give you salvation there power to save you why are you unsaved because you can't come out of the world you're not opening your heart to the world the word power even as preachers preach what is it happening waves of the holy ghost that comes and picks that and places it upon your heart and brings salvation to that's why the word must be preached the Bible says the word must be preached the parts of the earth must be preached not read only that's why you don't only stay at your house you must come to church and you must be preached to because by hearing the word salvation is being created hallelujah amen the that's why when you hear the word it's like a force that comes upon you and many times we've seen it many times I've seen it under my Ministry whereby people would just be hearing the word and the wave of the Holy Ghost just come upon a person begin shaking begin falling shouting you never touched them what was that it is the word that provokes things to be to be to begin happening Amen in the hearts of people whereby when they open up the word comes in them to begin to Des them and begin to rebuke them and begins to convict them of conviction comes by hearing the word not by going to a bar but by hearing the word and the word of God not a word of a man the power of the third it also has power over the forces of nature you remember one time I was reading it in the message Look Away to Jesus 1963 but the B spoke about the storm of came up and when I was arriving in Switzerland something tiny to that came a storm a blizzard came and we were still you know downhill and the pastor sent a notice said there is a there is a snowstorm because the convention center was on up on uphill was in the mountains there and so um the place down was okay our car was a little small so you began driving up you know snow started increasing started inreasing it reached a place until it now became scary because you see the road is narrow and the corners are sharp and the road is now slippery and the snow is becoming you know like the width is becoming bigger and it came to a place where we in cannot now drive through that snow I saw the brother pray now the brother who was driving was praying and I was on the other seat I I had never seen snow all my life when I saw someone pray and he the one driving I was worried because I was thinking anything can happen the road is Tiny the car is small there is a huge huge cffs whereby you can SK and and I was asking him which time are we all right he said yes are we all right yes now when he began praying I was worried now I also started praying I said God don't let me die in this mountain but I believe that snow storm was not as heavy as the one by up in Canada and as he was in that snowstorm he said it had become you know the snow had become too high and many people had died in such kind [Music] of Imagine to just come and cover you up and you know there's nowhere to go there's no and and he started to go out and try to see CU he knew his way but the Holy Spirit told him go back and he went back and when he reached there he told him am I not the one who created nature am I not the one who created this then he told him speak to this St speak to this St Hallelujah and he stood and he spoke to the stop and he said the stop stop and for 3 days there was uninterrupted [Applause] Sunshine hallelujah amen is the same same thing like in Luke chapter 8 where the Bible tells us you know Jesus he arose and he rebuked the wind and the Raging of the waters and the storm C what is that is the power of the third Ministry amen Joshua in the Old Testament you know he stood up also when they were fighting and the enemies wereing and he knew he did not have more hours in the day so he said no we cannot be defeated we don't want Darkness to come God gave him Revelation he was taken up higher on a third phase third level Ministry of the Bride Hallelujah and he said stand still Moon stay in your place scientifically impossible but it happen it happen it happened and it can happen again again amen now let me bring it down home when I had just believed the message one preacher came and preach something like this in our little church and I was amazed and one Sunday morning after I had heard what the preacher preached I was at home and it started raining cats and dog and I was supposed to me I always wanted to go to church I always wanted to be whenever there was a Serv let me tell you when you find a Believer and a service is going on and they don't want to go I'm not saying they not able to go I'm saying they don't want to go are you hearing me there is a problem with their experience I always wanted to go to church and so I said no I'm going to church I stood out in my Bible I thought if I go through this rain I'm going to be sought my Bible will all be well I didn't have an umbrella because I couldn't afford but I wanted to go to church what I was was there I remembered of course I didn't have a car I didn't even have a bicycle but I wanted to go toch so I remembered what the brother had preached over there were some people on the other Verandas and so they saw me do but I didn't have an option I knew if it doesn't happen I'm going to be embarrassed but I did it anyhow I said rain in the name of Jesus I command you to stop until I come back home from church then you can start and I I continued standing there and the other people started laughing so I started praying slowly I said God don't ashame me but friends God can never hallelujah amen each time I've stood for God he never ashamed me I've ashamed him many times but he has never ashamed me whenever I stood for him don't fear to stand for him stand for the word he can never sh you do you want to know what happened it just went like MH and it was calm and I speak in the name of the Lord it started shining I took my Bible started walking the church I forgot about it even when I was at church I forgot about it I didn't remember what had happened the morning when I came back and he started powering again with even Hil storms that's when I remembered I start thanking God thank you Jesus you did it you did it let me tell you the power of the third pH the power of the word it has power over nature over nature to realize nature when Nature is misbehaving has power over even over your nature when your nature is misbehaving you can speak life you can speak life and control it by the power of the word hallelujah you see why the word is powerful and Jesus is the word but when he spoke the word they were offended and what did they do they left him now I'm trying to bring you to a clima in just a few moments 6 six from that time many of his disciples went [Music] back and they walked no more with him he engaged the first they said yeah you are our Prophet you our King you the best pastor in the world all right oh yes this is lovely prophecy designment Hallelujah you are my pastor forever all right he that doesn't eat my fles doesn't drink my blood worth of me we thought that you are going to be our pastor and work no more with him they went back and work no more with him then Jesus started crying because his followers had left and he told them please come back so the sleepers say now yes he looked to the the 12 disciples he told them they have left will you also go away then Simon Peter oh I love that question will you go away there used to be a preacher in in our church we used to say if you don't want what I'm preaching go away go where you came from your denomination and it always offended me and I was like can't leave that and PR the word evangelists have a way of striking you and but Jesus one time was also an evangelist he said will you also go away to the disciples that he had Simon answer Lord Lord to whom shall we go Hallelujah somebody here Al to say the same thing to whom shall we go who shall we go who can do powerful Miracles is that it to whom shall we go that can give us some money when to whom shall we go who has words of Hallelujah take everything and give me the word take your religion and give me the take your money and give me the take your associations and organizations take your friendships take give me the word I will choose the word each time and we believe and assure that thou Christ they did not only believe they were sure about what you believe we are not called to be Church MERS I am not here to be a church member I refuse to be only a church member I am here to be a follower of Jesus believe it and be sure of it they left Jesus's Ministry because their interest was not the word they always leave when the interest is not the word I remember I told you a story in Ethiopia one time we went and baptized the pastor Pentecostal Pastor who had claimed to have believ the message and after we had preached in his church but we notic something when never we preaching the word these people were always doing but whenever he came up and he began mirac everybody's aw everybody jumping everybody so I notic there's a problem here if this is good and right why is this making people when the word begins to make people do there's a problem with that church there is a problem with what they're standing for and that Pastor came to me said I want you to baptize me and he came with his associate and we bapti both of them in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ baptism is not a ticket to Heaven it's only a testimony that you believe but if you don't believe and do it it amounts to nothing so we baptized him and he saided coming each time you I have this proposal I need you to you know if you you have some people who can support us and you connect us to them we have this project to build our church we need this much money and I'm like but is it Pastor sorry I mentioned his name his name so I said I told him but pastor each time we meet you talk about money and needs that's all okay but my interest with you is the word he say yeah I love the one but now you cannot preach without money well as long as you are preaching to the ones who came for food but if you preaching to the ones who need the word you can even preach when they under a tree so I told him we may not connect very well let's let this not be the approach so over time over time so I decided in my in myself CU it was like telling me you see you can even come and bapti all my members as long as I tell them they just accept and then you would send testimonies and you know you can also be supported the day he said that he provoked me and I told him this is not why I came to Ethiopia if I leave Ethiopia with only two Souls but genuine Believers that's enough I am not going to make merchandise of the gohost and I disconnected myself from him and after so long about um seven months eight months his associate came back to me he said pastor now I've come to join you I've come to join you Pentecost can do it really well he said I've come to submit myself under your ministry I said under I know I baptized you but I also know how we separated with you so how come that you here you know that man is's not a good man he's not a good man at all because even he didn't even know how to read the Bible it was even me reading the Bible for him and he will just speak it he just all about money and and we even disagreed and I thought let me even tell you the secret he actually told me I was being baptized after all is the name of Jesus it doesn't matter let me do it so they can give us money so that's why we got baptized so Pastor me I'm coming to submit myself under your ministry because I'm going to sincerely support your work I told him brother I'm happy to see now I was like Jesus when you saw the Thousand phip do we have enough food I knew this man was coming for food not for the word how do you know them that's how they come they talk evil about everybody else and they praise you so they can provoke you to right be careful of anyone who talks evil of anyone even if that anyone was your enemy you remember the man who came to David our enem is dead told him kill him they killed him why how could he speak that of my enemy his God is Anointed too he ought not to have spoken about it not something good it is something sad what am I trying to say friends when they left Jesus's Ministry they were not interested in the word and Jesus was not pulling for a following he asked even the remaining to go sometimes in the ministry you have to provoke people to go because sometimes it may be very important to maintain a Revival when there are many who want food more than they were Jesus had to provoke them can go they said no where can we go who to who has the words of they have always left they left Paul one and these are for our examples Paul wrote to Timothy and he said to him has forsaken me having loved this present world and Deus and is departed to but he said take Mark and also look is with me and take Mark bring him with you meaning bring him to me he is profitable to me for the min hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah are you profitable for the ministry oh I feel like talking T right now let me tell you brother sister you always you as an individual you must come to a place where you ask yourself a question how am I profitable to dvf Ministry remember there how am I profitable what am I adding to the body right what sisters brother what am I adding to the body well if it's my attendance so be it I will be in every service if it is with my money I support if it is with my I if it is doing music I do it praise the lord we want men and women who are profitable for the don't just be in church to to create a crowd we want men and women who are profitable for the ministry let me tell you even if I have three or five or 10 and they profitable to the ministry I am happy with that and if you don't like it you to can go Sister Rose if you don't want that I didn't call you to be a member of this church did I call you my mother know you are my mother create a for us and don't tell me I'm disrespecting my I never called her where is Peter call here and you stand outside I will chase you out of the church did I call you in the beginning my biological brother I you come do we were inana I this young man to the Lord and then he moved to ca and he was going to another church and you know we came up here he would come and visit us and go and then eventually relocated he went to stay there for a long time I even told him please at least go to and I told him to go to in he even refused to hear me he went to another church who told you to come back did I call you now that's why you should be serious we shall Chas you anybody who we don't want we here to me business we have not come here to pick on one another to find Perfect People none of us is perfect but all of us are being made perfect when you came to the church it didn't come to find perfect you come to find a people that love the word regardless and that's why we are here friends we are not here to support a man I am just one little in a beach I may die [Music] tomorrow and if I die the work of God continues it doesn't depend on me the it depends on the word hallelujah and friends we really need to understand this is not about ofal family business you don't help me when you do something in the church no no no no no no you don't help me it's not my Ministry no it is a Ministry of the Kingdom bringing men into the kingdom of God praise the name of the Lord you see I was looking at this young man when he went to you know took him to school I did not ask him to be coming back each time for he told me he would like to be coming and he asked whether I could help I said yes I will and a few others as well I'm willing to help if I can somebody who wants something but I'm sick and tired of being pulled into supporting and help when it's not going to amount to anything praise God and so uh first John chapter 2 and I'll finish in a moment here if you give me a few more moments here you want me to finish I see no say what I said brother don't want to lie the people amen little children it is the last time and it is the last time and as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come even now are there many Antichrist whereby we know that it is the last time they went out from us but they were not of us they had been of us they no doubt have continued with us but they went out that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us and in in John 6:44 no man can come to me except the Father which has sent me draw him and I will raise him up at the last day it is written in the prophets and they shall be all T of God every man therefore has heard and land of the father cometh to me praise God you see he says he draws his own are always being drawn there was a young man here recently and this just came to my mind I wasn't ining to talk about that you know came and it was during Co said pastor I want to you know join the assembly here I said but we have no assembly we just beginning in our house fellow he said well I feel I should you know be a part of you I said all right where have you been told me the church so he came and joined and um for a while he was there shortly after that I want to marry sister and after a while I heard and I speak this on on the P pit for a purpose I heard that he actually expected that I would marry for him you know Pastor has money he's going and when they asked him for lot of things he could not pay them and he kind of wanted to call off the whole thing but I waited for him to come and tell me that you are supposed to uh pay pay for me that sounds unreal but it was his expectation it is sad isn't it doesn't come to church again very long time afterwards you know sometimes I'm a person who doesn't ridicule or talk about people but sometimes when it is necessary the congregation it is important to talk about it because things go around and you not never addressed them we need to be mature people with a mature understanding and so later on um you know spends quite a long time without coming to church and then uh he says Pastor I have something to speak to you what is it I'm still a member of the church in myself I laughed you a member who doesn't pay TI who doesn't attend church who streams he may even be streaming now who streams and you never attend church but everybody knows you as a member no you're not a member that you are a member of a church when you are a member of the church right we've gone already through that and so later on writes me a long message now Pastor I'm sorry I just wanted to let you know I I went back to the church where I was at and you know long story short so I told him brother it is all right if you went back to the the church where you went at I never called you in the past but you should have had enough responsibility like you came to me physically to come to me physically and inform me the same God who led you to come has you you never had the GS you just send me on Whatsapp I've realized Our Generation needs to really be corrected you know there are certain things you speak with people on WhatsApp especially if people are more mature than you and people to be honored as those who gives you the word of and are those things you need to meet them [Music] one and tell them your rather than send a WhatsApp we need to be respectable we need to be a generation that respects Ministers of I'm one person who respects all pastors never speak of against any I never do that because I believe all of them are men of God they not things the way I see it but I I can only give you what God has given me to give you no man can give you what he doesn't have you can only receive what he has praise God and if any of our brothers and sisters here any member ever at one point felt you know I'm not comfortable here but I feel to go and attend church somewhere else you don't need to you know walk like a snake come meet me I promise you I'll be very gracious I will ask you a question though why are you doing have we grieved you or is the Lord leading ising I am not going to question God is it God is it not God if it is God it is God if you say it is God then it is God and I will bless you it's just like this young man are you a young man he came to me with his wife and told me we've been another Ministry God has led us to come did I invite you brother no no did I invite you where is Sister Juliet raise up your hand did I call and invite you or call your husband you and your husband came on in our home and informed us God has led us I advised you one thing God has go back to your pastor and tell him the same I receive you with open arm you know when we talk about churches it's not our homes neither our family you are not I don't own you I don't own no you are owned by Jesus Christ you can go you can come but be respectable do things in order that way you will serve the pastor the trouble of talking about this and that and they will just be studying and preaching the word and so um the ones that are drawn by the word they will always stay but the ones that drawn by other things they will always do but I'm so thankful that I came into this message because I was drawn by the word by the word not by friendship relationship by the word by the word praise God let us stand on the feet I just I've left about two pages but and that's the word we contend for you know the Bible says he was on Earth and he did not follow his own thoughts he did not follow his own will but he sacrificed his own will and his own thoughts he sacrificed it all to follow the mind and the will of the father that's what we need to do Christ came to do the will of the father we are here not to contend for our thoughts but to contend for his thoughts for his word we have been manifested here to do the will of the father to do his word to to whom shall we go we cannot leave the word to whom shall we go who has words of eternal life he said I am the way I am the truth I am the life friends others may go and walk away from this message sometimes even walk away from the fellow but I want you to stick to that remain with the word that's why we are called we are called to stay with how many here will stand with the word so Lord help to stand with the word I will stand with the word I want to be faithful oh help us Lord Jesus to be faithful to you all the words have said and maybe even some words I did not intend to say but somehow I was late to say Lord Jesus let it impact the people positively and if there is something negative saying Lord forgive me Lord for my purpose is to edify the people to help them Lord father God I Just Surrender out to you Lord I want to withhold

[Music] [Music] [Music] huj brother Jo amen yes reception actually the bride and the groom they requested me and say that they desire their desire is to be in church on Sunday morning and so we it's a weekend we're going to be busy the whole weekend Friday we are going to some few family members will be going for the introduction and I think a few church members who were invited uh we go about 30 people there and then on on Saturday that will be the wedding and then Sunday we shall have a service and they desire to be in the service those things can happen usually when the wedding is finished early okay so if everybody is seated by 9:30 within one hour we shall be out of the church you even remember and wedding I wasn't long I think within one hour we out the only issue is the bride entage took long to arrive and so that took quite some time but if everybody arrives on time and by uh 9:30 we are out of church by 10:30 we'll be out of church so everybody is invited to church don't say I wasn't invited at re support so I'm not going to go to the wedding iused to so don't do that it's not a good spirit if you're a church member come and support your very own these are young people from our church and we need to show them love and we need to be there for them even if you're already married because we always tend to believe that the unmarried are the ones who will need to be there to support so they can also be supported so everybody will be invited here at 9 a.m. amen then uh on sun on I think the reception I don't need to talk much about the reception because if you going to the reception then you you already like he said you'll be given a card and um everything will be known there reception will also take very little time usually what takes reception is delaying to arrive and then food and then but since it's a hotel we expect they will serve us at the time we want and also uh we shall arrive there on time so by 3 or 4 everything should be done because on Sunday we have another wonderful time we have ministers from Kenya going to come here on Sunday be expectant God is going to visit us and uh come expecting and praying then on the next Sunday we are going to host pastor of speckled so I'd like you to be expectant be in prayer for that meeting is making a big sacrifice to come and Min because it means he would need to leave his ministry and come to minister to us so it's a sacrifice I know it because I've done before for some and I know as a pastor it's difficult so let us pray for him and pray for that Sunday and prepare also to invite your friends to come and be a part of so I Brother Martin I see you here do you have another announcement could you please come your announcement e e e for
