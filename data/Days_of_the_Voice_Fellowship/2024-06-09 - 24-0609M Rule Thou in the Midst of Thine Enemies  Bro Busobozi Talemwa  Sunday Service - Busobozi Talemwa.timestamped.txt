[1:28:29] moment I'd like to greet you all in the
[1:28:31] precious name of our Lord
[1:28:35] Jesus um we've
[1:28:38] [Music]
[1:28:41] um we've been blessed this
[1:28:44] week with uh two uh of our families here
[1:28:50] you know being blessed with children
[1:28:58] amen amen let us for the Lord praise the
[1:29:03] Lord hallelujah hallelujah amen the wife
[1:29:07] of Brother Martin sister wi is not here
[1:29:09] of course she she she she just was
[1:29:11] delivered of the
[1:29:14] baby amen and baby was healthy mother
[1:29:17] was
[1:29:19] healthy and um then this other family
[1:29:22] they were praying for
[1:29:25] uh they uh they
[1:29:28] had you know gone to the hospital I
[1:29:30] think they went to one of the hospitals
[1:29:32] here one of the
[1:29:35] government and they referred them
[1:29:39] to and there they now recommended for
[1:29:42] them to have a
[1:29:48] ceran and uh the Believers prayed you
[1:29:51] prayed and God overturned that
[1:29:55] amen and the baby was delivered
[1:29:59] safely you see but some of us who have
[1:30:02] gone through uh series of child
[1:30:08] birth you know that that moment the
[1:30:10] enemy usually
[1:30:13] fights Brother Martin you can feel free
[1:30:15] to bring those people right over here we
[1:30:17] have seats here actually
[1:30:21] amen yeah
[1:30:24] come come on up here if if you don't
[1:30:27] mind okay so uh the enemy usually fights
[1:30:33] that but God always fights for his
[1:30:37] own you believe that how many believe
[1:30:43] God Amen and we know that our
[1:30:47] side amen
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:56] so we should continue believing for that
[1:30:59] family there is a a v that we've heard
[1:31:02] uh I think others greeted the church
[1:31:07] but brother
[1:31:13] Michael yes from God bless you you're
[1:31:18] welcome amen thank you so much for
[1:31:20] coming to fellowship with
[1:31:22] us and there's also sister
[1:31:27] God bless
[1:31:29] you now this one is my
[1:31:33] S and you are
[1:31:35] welcome she told Mom this morning I want
[1:31:38] to go and fellowship with
[1:31:48] you we welcome you so much may the Lord
[1:31:51] bless you
[1:31:54] we believe the
[1:31:57] Bible and we believe if you have the
[1:31:59] thirst and hunger for the word God is
[1:32:02] going to fill you up amen amen um my
[1:32:05] mother lost um
[1:32:10] uh what you would call um I know we even
[1:32:15] announced it badly last
[1:32:19] time uh but the person that died
[1:32:24] was her only living father remaining
[1:32:27] living
[1:32:31] father Yes who uh in that case would be
[1:32:35] my
[1:32:37] grandfather so the only remaining
[1:32:40] one and he happened to be uh a
[1:32:45] brother in the in the Roman Catholic
[1:32:50] church so on my mother's
[1:32:52] side most of
[1:32:54] of her people are Roman
[1:32:57] Catholics and not just
[1:32:59] Catholics but they were really into the
[1:33:02] the uh
[1:33:04] the I don't know how to call it the
[1:33:08] system the system
[1:33:12] yes find their fathers brothers
[1:33:15] [Music]
[1:33:17] sisters was raised in the in the
[1:33:20] convent for H for a few
[1:33:22] years so as we went there for barrial
[1:33:27] last week I found that there was um very
[1:33:30] many other brothers that had been buried
[1:33:32] in that
[1:33:35] place and most of them
[1:33:37] die very late stages in their
[1:33:42] life uh so you find that they in '90s
[1:33:48] of course they usually leave they
[1:33:51] married to the church
[1:33:54] and they are you know part of the
[1:33:57] system and so the church takes care of
[1:34:00] them from the moment they uh go to um
[1:34:05] become
[1:34:08] priests this particular one brother
[1:34:12] Michael um was one of the old ones
[1:34:16] actually I remember you know we used to
[1:34:18] go in in that is it called a convent
[1:34:24] yeah we used to we used to go there and
[1:34:27] visit them he was a the
[1:34:32] superior of
[1:34:34] St I think secondary
[1:34:38] school and um he he is now no
[1:34:43] more well on the side of my mother he
[1:34:45] she has lost her
[1:34:47] father and feel free to consult with
[1:34:50] cons her after the service
[1:34:54] but on on the side of the
[1:34:56] spiritual we know that we were all born
[1:35:00] in those
[1:35:02] systems but God delivered us out
[1:35:06] of and my mother I'm so glad God
[1:35:08] delivered her out
[1:35:10] of and and God delivered you out
[1:35:14] of you know my mother was saying when we
[1:35:18] went that they slept there at one of the
[1:35:22] a night before before
[1:35:26] burial and uh so they would be having a
[1:35:29] few sessions of
[1:35:31] prayer and the priest would come and
[1:35:34] preach now the father
[1:35:38] now for us we don't need to stud to
[1:35:40] become
[1:35:42] brothers the moment we believe the
[1:35:45] gospel we become
[1:35:47] brothers and we we don't have
[1:35:50] fathers our heavenly father is the
[1:35:52] father
[1:35:54] and our father would
[1:35:57] come and begin
[1:35:59] preaching for a few minutes but you know
[1:36:02] she said these
[1:36:04] words um those people are
[1:36:08] hungry because you could
[1:36:10] see that when the priest comes he surely
[1:36:14] has no food to feed
[1:36:17] the and
[1:36:19] um this this this brother what's his
[1:36:22] name
[1:36:25] uh brother
[1:36:27] Sega he came to me you know he came from
[1:36:31] those
[1:36:36] sister are the things you tell us in
[1:36:39] church people are hungry
[1:36:43] here you sit here and you can't even get
[1:36:49] anything it's as if you just there and
[1:36:52] then he come and talk
[1:36:55] Pastor You Preach to us the truth you
[1:36:57] know you cannot know when you're still
[1:37:00] there come out and you sit under the
[1:37:03] preaching of the
[1:37:05] message you cannot fit anywhere
[1:37:08] else can let me tell you I see people
[1:37:12] who back slide from the
[1:37:14] message if God doesn't give them Grace
[1:37:16] to be
[1:37:17] restored they are Aon case because there
[1:37:21] is nowhere there is no church there's no
[1:37:23] they can fit
[1:37:26] anym many of you you have been from many
[1:37:29] denominations you come and then you go
[1:37:32] to another and then you go to
[1:37:34] another but you see you kept on finding
[1:37:37] something new something new but when you
[1:37:40] arrive in this
[1:37:42] message you can no longer find
[1:37:45] anything and that's why you should make
[1:37:47] your calling an election
[1:37:50] sure and be established in the present
[1:37:53] truth
[1:37:55] so that when the trumpet of God
[1:37:58] sounds you will be ready to go in the
[1:38:03] rapt most of you you don't know what you
[1:38:05] have until you lose

[1:44:37] liar once again how many have
[1:44:40] enemies okay now there are those who
[1:44:43] don't have enemies and there are those
[1:44:45] who don't know that they
[1:44:49] have but as I speak right now they those
[1:44:53] who have told
[1:44:56] people speak me oh I will never talk to
[1:44:59] you
[1:45:00] again or even if you said
[1:45:03] nothing there are some of you who have
[1:45:05] uh
[1:45:08] bitterness on your heart about someone
[1:45:12] now I realize that
[1:45:15] bitterness is one of the things that
[1:45:17] will uh drown you very fast
[1:45:24] bitterness if you are rich it can make
[1:45:26] you
[1:45:28] poor if you're big it can make you
[1:45:31] small bitterness or the root of
[1:45:34] bitterness in your heart is something
[1:45:37] that a Christian should never
[1:45:40] have no matter what people do to
[1:45:43] you no matter what they do to you say no
[1:45:47] matter what they speak about you no
[1:45:49] matter what they say about you you
[1:45:52] should never come to a
[1:45:54] place where you will have a root of
[1:45:58] bitterness you find that people have
[1:46:02] bitterness women have
[1:46:04] bitterness men have bitterness fathers
[1:46:07] get
[1:46:09] bitterness wives get bitterness mothers
[1:46:12] fathers and even children and this is
[1:46:16] the even the worst part even
[1:46:19] ministers preachers pastors
[1:46:23] you you find many times they get
[1:46:25] bitterness and bitterness or the root of
[1:46:29] bitterness will bring you down
[1:46:32] faster than any powerful
[1:46:35] force you find that a preacher who has
[1:46:39] bitterness can cause a great damage to
[1:46:41] the body of
[1:46:44] Christ much faster than the devil
[1:46:48] can because of the root of
[1:46:51] bitterness someone that his
[1:46:55] heart or someone who is disappointed in
[1:46:58] someone or someone who is heartbroken by
[1:47:02] someone that person is usually very
[1:47:07] sensitive and you need to be to go slow
[1:47:10] on
[1:47:13] them you know you may think that you are
[1:47:15] dealing with something you know you are
[1:47:17] helping
[1:47:19] them but in the process you are
[1:47:21] destroying yourself and destroy them
[1:47:25] more simply because they have
[1:47:29] bitterness they have been
[1:47:32] heartbroken I'll give you you know this
[1:47:35] example and this I don't it's my first
[1:47:38] time going to say
[1:47:41] this when when we came from Miana for
[1:47:46] instance in my heart and that of my wife
[1:47:48] we had some uh bitterness
[1:47:53] because there were things that
[1:47:55] happened and there were things that were
[1:47:58] said things which were not
[1:48:00] true things which were not
[1:48:02] right and we felt we very
[1:48:07] disappointed people with
[1:48:09] loved people we
[1:48:11] trusted people we we we we we were
[1:48:14] together with for years and
[1:48:16] years and someone comes up and says
[1:48:19] something against you that it rips your
[1:48:22] heart
[1:48:24] and you feel you you are so
[1:48:26] bitter in your heart about them and you
[1:48:30] know the Lord you know spoke to to
[1:48:32] us that we had to
[1:48:35] move that was not the only
[1:48:38] reason but there were other reasons
[1:48:40] there were some people believing in this
[1:48:43] area and we had baptized about 10 people
[1:48:47] and God now laid it on my heart to come
[1:48:49] and
[1:48:51] help and so but there was also the other
[1:48:55] part which I have never spoken of
[1:48:59] publicly until today and the only reason
[1:49:01] I'm speaking about it because I want to
[1:49:03] help some
[1:49:05] people I'm convinced there are people
[1:49:07] who need
[1:49:09] help it may be here or online or
[1:49:12] whatever because you are people and I'm
[1:49:14] a
[1:49:15] person I know that whatever I suffer you
[1:49:17] can
[1:49:18] suffer and our Prophet told us to teach
[1:49:21] experience
[1:49:23] so I usually want to preach what I've
[1:49:26] experienced I usually want to preach
[1:49:29] what I know
[1:49:30] about and so we were bitter in our
[1:49:33] heart and um so when we came um yes I
[1:49:38] wanted to start the
[1:49:40] fellowship but I was still bitter and I
[1:49:43] knew if I start a
[1:49:45] fellowship and I start preaching I am
[1:49:48] not going to preach about anything
[1:49:51] else but it's going to be out of the
[1:49:53] bitterness of my
[1:49:56] heart and some people have
[1:49:59] suffered in some
[1:50:01] churches with having preachers that are
[1:50:05] heartbroken having preachers that are
[1:50:07] bitter in their
[1:50:08] hearts whereby you know he will come and
[1:50:11] and and and he will Hammer you Hammer
[1:50:13] you Hammer you or Hammer a
[1:50:17] situation that you know if you have H
[1:50:19] him or
[1:50:21] something and then he and you know
[1:50:23] preachers we are very
[1:50:25] good we can be able to have scriptures
[1:50:27] for
[1:50:29] everything if you do something to
[1:50:32] me I can take scriptures and preach
[1:50:35] against
[1:50:37] you I tell you preachers are very good
[1:50:39] at
[1:50:40] that and maybe some of you have sat
[1:50:42] under such
[1:50:45] ministri whereby maybe the minister was
[1:50:48] hammering
[1:50:49] you for something that maybe you did or
[1:50:52] they did to you whatever it
[1:50:54] is and it is a it's the most
[1:50:56] uncomfortable State you want to be
[1:50:59] in it is the most uncomfortable State
[1:51:02] the church wants to be
[1:51:05] in whereby people's hearts will be
[1:51:08] raped where people go to church to hear
[1:51:11] from
[1:51:12] God but they end up being ripped
[1:51:15] apart and I felt I said God I not I
[1:51:18] don't want to be a part of that because
[1:51:21] I said to myself early on
[1:51:23] that I will never preach
[1:51:26] situation that I will always preach
[1:51:30] inspiration because there are many
[1:51:32] situations that can come
[1:51:34] up you know a
[1:51:36] minister had a fight with his
[1:51:39] wife and that day you will know because
[1:51:42] he will come on the pulit when he's very
[1:51:45] angry when he's rubbishing
[1:51:48] everything when he's taking everybody to
[1:51:51] hell you know
[1:51:53] today past I think he fought with his
[1:51:55] wife how many have experienced that
[1:51:58] before some of you have experienced that
[1:52:00] before you know there is a problem
[1:52:02] somewhere the pastor is not is not is
[1:52:04] not there and that is the greatest the
[1:52:07] greatest
[1:52:09] mistake any God called Minister will
[1:52:12] ever
[1:52:14] do so
[1:52:16] long to preach
[1:52:19] situations instead of preaching
[1:52:21] inspiration
[1:52:24] I believe every Minister every Pastor
[1:52:26] every
[1:52:28] preacher must himself to the holy
[1:52:32] ghost that he will listen from
[1:52:35] God have the food for that
[1:52:38] moment for the people no matter what is
[1:52:41] happening in his life or in the life of
[1:52:44] the
[1:52:45] people he will preach an
[1:52:48] inspiration not a
[1:52:50] situation and I'm preaching about
[1:52:53] love and a brother and a sister comes in
[1:52:55] the
[1:52:56] church wearing a
[1:52:58] trouser and then myON will
[1:53:01] change let us go
[1:53:04] to
[1:53:06] not Pastor you're
[1:53:10] preaching are you inspired really you
[1:53:13] are not inspired I believe I don't care
[1:53:16] how many women come wearing
[1:53:18] trousers if God did not inspire me to
[1:53:21] preach about that day
[1:53:23] I will not talk about
[1:53:26] it you come wearing makeup I will see
[1:53:30] you and I say what is happening to
[1:53:32] sister but if God has not inspired me to
[1:53:34] talk about
[1:53:35] it I cannot talk about it because it is
[1:53:39] not an
[1:53:40] inspiration I believe we should preach
[1:53:43] Inspirations we should never preach
[1:53:47] situations praise the name of the Lord
[1:53:50] and so we were very
[1:53:51] heartbroken so we spent we spent a few
[1:53:54] months in the
[1:53:55] house and during that time we were
[1:53:57] praying praying and praying we did much
[1:54:00] of prayer asking God to just give us
[1:54:03] Grace and understanding and mercy in our
[1:54:06] hearts and
[1:54:07] forgiveness and all of the sudden one
[1:54:10] day we were praying were in prayer and
[1:54:13] my wife was there and a few May two or
[1:54:15] three others children and there was a
[1:54:19] great
[1:54:21] outp of the holy spirit let me tell you
[1:54:25] the holy spirit is
[1:54:26] real God is real if you have never had
[1:54:30] that portion in your
[1:54:32] life listen to what I'm telling you
[1:54:35] because I received that portion and I've
[1:54:37] received it over and
[1:54:40] over praise God and it was like a I
[1:54:44] don't know how to explain it like a cool
[1:54:50] breeze and like something so strong
[1:54:54] it just came and it was again like
[1:54:57] fire cool but like fire I don't know how
[1:54:59] to explain
[1:55:01] it just came upon
[1:55:06] me and I began crying and crying and
[1:55:10] crying and crying and crying and that
[1:55:13] that moment while that experience was
[1:55:15] going
[1:55:16] on the Holy Spirit was ministering to me
[1:55:20] the Holy Spirit was massaging my heart
[1:55:23] and telling me things I have not heard
[1:55:26] before about the other people that
[1:55:30] had and and he began to convict me of
[1:55:34] sin of how wrong I was he showed me many
[1:55:38] wrongs about
[1:55:40] myself that I never knew that I
[1:55:43] had he began showing me everything about
[1:55:46] the enemies that I thought I
[1:55:49] had and he began showing me how much I
[1:55:53] needed
[1:55:54] them he demonstrated to me how bad I was
[1:56:00] and how I needed to put myself
[1:56:04] right here is something that is funny he
[1:56:07] never did show me anything bad about my
[1:56:11] en he only showed me good about
[1:56:15] them and bad about you I can't believe
[1:56:19] it almost you may not you may not
[1:56:21] believe me but I'm
[1:56:23] my wife was there we both had that
[1:56:27] experience and afterwards we collected
[1:56:30] ourselves and began to speak to one
[1:56:33] another and then I told her what I was
[1:56:35] experiencing and she told me to and then
[1:56:38] we agreed we had to call them up meet
[1:56:42] them
[1:56:43] up and
[1:56:46] repent not them to
[1:56:48] repent but for us to repent
[1:56:52] put ourselves right and the moment that
[1:56:55] happened it was like
[1:56:58] oh like a burden was
[1:57:01] LIF the Holy Spirit came and lifted
[1:57:07] up let me tell you
[1:57:09] friends we talk about
[1:57:12] Christianity but it was at that
[1:57:15] moment that I knew what Christianity
[1:57:18] is and it was on that basis
[1:57:22] that we started the
[1:57:24] fellowship and that's why you've never
[1:57:26] heard
[1:57:27] me slander
[1:57:30] anyone because this ministry is not
[1:57:33] built on that
[1:57:34] basis it is built on the basis of
[1:57:36] Healing
[1:57:38] Hearts delivering the
[1:57:40] bound setting the captives
[1:57:43] free this reminds me another experience
[1:57:47] I'll give
[1:57:48] you one time I went
[1:57:50] preaching and this man came up he teared
[1:57:54] me apart afterwards you know I was
[1:57:56] preaching about
[1:57:57] Easter and how Jesus you know rose again
[1:58:01] from the
[1:58:02] dead and then I spoke about his baptism
[1:58:06] and how the Dove came upon him because
[1:58:09] he was a lamb he was the Lamb of of God
[1:58:12] that takes away the sins of the
[1:58:13] world and so and then I I spoke to the
[1:58:17] people I said do you want the the dove
[1:58:20] to come upon you the Holy Spirit to come
[1:58:23] upon you everybody said yes amen I said
[1:58:27] well you have to be a
[1:58:31] lamb you have to let God the spirit of
[1:58:34] the
[1:58:36] pig you always go in Mad of
[1:58:40] sin you have to let it go you have to
[1:58:44] let the spirit of the god you so you can
[1:58:47] have the spirit of the
[1:58:48] lamb and then the D will come upon
[1:58:52] and this brother came after
[1:58:54] service he spoke to me said brother
[1:58:56] thank you for the service said but I
[1:58:58] have one thing against you he said How
[1:59:00] Could You Preach against
[1:59:02] me I said how did I preach about against
[1:59:05] you he said you called me a
[1:59:07] pig how could you call me a I said but
[1:59:10] brother never did I mention your name
[1:59:13] said no but everybody could
[1:59:18] see you were talking against
[1:59:22] it is me you called a
[1:59:24] pig I said brother if you felt you were
[1:59:27] a pig all that you felt that the things
[1:59:30] I was talking about was referring to you
[1:59:33] then just repent and be a lamb because
[1:59:37] God doesn't want you
[1:59:39] to you were abusing me that's not
[1:59:42] preaching brother you you don't even
[1:59:44] know how to preach you cannot talk like
[1:59:47] that and spoke things he ripped me apart
[1:59:53] if you know when you're coming on the
[1:59:54] pool to minister you wait upon God you
[1:59:59] pray you study and so when you have a
[2:00:03] case like
[2:00:04] that you feel like God I no longer want
[2:00:06] to do
[2:00:08] ministry I was ripped apart and for
[2:00:12] years I CED
[2:00:13] that I C that against that
[2:00:17] brother I'm I'm doing some confessions
[2:00:20] this morning
[2:00:24] while I'm confessing I know God is
[2:00:25] designing some of
[2:00:27] your and so sister peace I found myself
[2:00:31] in a city called
[2:00:34] shenzen in
[2:00:36] China and while there there's a a family
[2:00:40] you know they speak
[2:00:42] Chinese Believers and they do not know
[2:00:46] any English but they invited me over to
[2:00:48] their house you know just you know a
[2:00:51] black minister coming from
[2:00:53] Africa so you can have some time and
[2:00:55] fellowship and I can go eat some
[2:00:58] food so we went there and we had some
[2:01:01] good
[2:01:02] time now here are things that I really
[2:01:05] will never
[2:01:08] forget this this couple the
[2:01:11] sister you know she picked me up from
[2:01:13] the train
[2:01:14] station you know her husband received me
[2:01:17] and and they were so happy and the whole
[2:01:20] time we couldn't communicate
[2:01:23] we were communicating in sign
[2:01:26] language but you know the whole time
[2:01:28] they were
[2:01:30] smiling and that touched me and when we
[2:01:33] reached the house they had a picture of
[2:01:35] the of brother bham
[2:01:37] there with a pit of fire on his head and
[2:01:41] so she was you know here's what she they
[2:01:43] did the brother I was seated with a
[2:01:45] brother not like after the meal we were
[2:01:49] seated not like this the moment when you
[2:01:52] now so we just looking at each other but
[2:01:56] the whole time the brother
[2:01:58] [Laughter]
[2:02:01] was yeah and then we H each other and
[2:02:05] now he he looked
[2:02:07] up the
[2:02:13] picture meaning you see that picture he
[2:02:17] was a messenger of God do you love him
[2:02:20] do you believe you
[2:02:23] yes heed me he was happy he was so
[2:02:27] happy he couldn't speak my language I
[2:02:31] couldn't speak his language but we
[2:02:33] understood each other so easily and so
[2:02:36] well and the love that he had in his
[2:02:39] heart for me it was just beyond what I
[2:02:42] could
[2:02:43] explain it was beyond until later on he
[2:02:48] gave me an
[2:02:49] app um I don't even remember the name of
[2:02:52] the app whereby you send a message in
[2:02:56] Chinese and it translates into
[2:02:58] English and back and forth and so that's
[2:03:02] how we started talking so we begin
[2:03:05] texting and then when we need to laugh
[2:03:07] we need to look at each other we begin
[2:03:09] laughing it was a very wonderful
[2:03:12] experience and then as I was leaving his
[2:03:15] house I was just thinking about those
[2:03:18] things so I went in my
[2:03:20] apartment and now that Sunday morning I
[2:03:23] was I was supposed to
[2:03:25] minister and so as I was going into my
[2:03:29] apartment it was just like a few blocks
[2:03:33] away I was thinking about the love of
[2:03:36] God I'm thinking about this
[2:03:38] man CH Chinese
[2:03:41] people I I would never met them my first
[2:03:45] time to meet them but they loved me with
[2:03:48] genuine
[2:03:51] not because I could give them
[2:03:53] anything because they were giving me
[2:03:56] something but simply because of Jesus
[2:03:59] Christ and it was
[2:04:01] there that the Holy Spirit just visited
[2:04:05] and said what about
[2:04:07] you you you have bitterness in your
[2:04:10] heart I said no I don't you said you do
[2:04:14] you remember that man who came up after
[2:04:16] you preached and spoke to you that
[2:04:18] way you've carried this bitterness in
[2:04:21] your heart for
[2:04:22] against
[2:04:23] him for all these years he said you
[2:04:26] cannot be a
[2:04:27] Christian anding
[2:04:30] this you have to
[2:04:33] forgive as he was designed the Holy
[2:04:35] Spirit can
[2:04:37] design as he was designing my
[2:04:40] heart I felt
[2:04:42] condemned I felt
[2:04:44] condemned I felt condemn until there was
[2:04:47] that moment that
[2:04:49] climax where it was I don't know how to
[2:04:52] explain those experiences it's very
[2:04:54] difficult to
[2:04:56] explain but it was like something like
[2:04:58] did
[2:04:59] like and in my heart I felt
[2:05:05] forgiveness and it was at that moment
[2:05:09] God gave me a lot of
[2:05:10] Joy I felt joy and speak and full of
[2:05:15] glory and I and he gave me a song and I
[2:05:18] started singing I didn't even know the
[2:05:20] song it just came all all of the sudden
[2:05:22] and I went and wrote it down when I
[2:05:25] needed to forgive those who hurt me I
[2:05:30] couldn't do it even to those that haunt
[2:05:35] me but when is
[2:05:37] great found me so
[2:05:40] wretched poor and blind I couldn't help
[2:05:45] it but to say I
[2:05:48] forgive and I started singing I'm free
[2:05:53] and I had a jubile in that
[2:05:55] room the Chinese that saw me rushing up
[2:05:57] when I'm happy and jumping up they
[2:06:00] didn't understand what was going on but
[2:06:03] the Holy Spirit was doing a
[2:06:04] work and and they called up that
[2:06:07] brother and I was so
[2:06:10] Joly brother you remember the other day
[2:06:13] it is some years
[2:06:15] ago I I had bitterness against
[2:06:19] you but I'm sorry was wrong I shouldn't
[2:06:22] have done that and brother I wanted you
[2:06:24] to know I forgive you and I forgive you
[2:06:29] and I love you with
[2:06:30] all and I felt a lot of
[2:06:33] freedom maybe there is someone here
[2:06:35] today cutting some
[2:06:37] bitterness for someone that hurt you for
[2:06:41] someone that haunted you but you need to
[2:06:47] forgive and
[2:06:49] today I had to take those minutes or
[2:06:52] so to speak to you about my own
[2:06:56] testimony now shall we go to the
[2:07:00] word rule thou in the midst of thine
[2:07:06] enemies now I'd like us to go to the
[2:07:08] Book of Daniel chapter 2
[2:07:24] we are reading verse
[2:07:37] 34 thou so till that a stone was cut out
[2:07:41] without hands which SM the image upon
[2:07:44] his feet and were of iron and clay and
[2:07:47] break them to Pieces
[2:07:49] 35 then was the the clay the brass the
[2:07:53] silver and the gold broken into pieces
[2:07:55] together and became like the Shar of the
[2:07:57] summer threshing flaws and a wind
[2:08:00] carried them away that no place was
[2:08:03] found for them and the stone that smart
[2:08:05] this image became a great mountain and
[2:08:08] fill the whole
[2:08:20] Earth for
[2:08:55] and now we are going to also read verses
[2:08:58] um
[2:09:00] 44 and in the and in the days of these
[2:09:03] Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a
[2:09:05] kingdom which shall never be
[2:09:07] destroyed and the kingdom shall not be
[2:09:10] left to the other but it shall break in
[2:09:12] pieces and consume all these kingdoms
[2:09:15] and shall stand forever
[2:09:40] praise the name of the Lord if you have
[2:09:42] enemies you are
[2:09:44] blessed because God cannot bless you
[2:09:47] without your
[2:09:49] enemies we are going to come to that
[2:09:51] short
[2:09:52] but before we talk about you I want to
[2:09:54] talk about the kingdom of
[2:09:57] Christ Christ has a
[2:10:00] kingdom and here Daniel now was uh you
[2:10:04] know began to see and talk about this
[2:10:08] stor of course he was giving the
[2:10:10] interpretation to the vision of the king
[2:10:13] the
[2:10:15] dream and um maybe if you can give me
[2:10:18] that picture there and he said he saw a
[2:10:20] stone that was cut out without
[2:10:25] hands now and and this Stone came and SM
[2:10:28] this
[2:10:29] image first of all you understand this
[2:10:31] is the image he
[2:10:33] saw and and the the image had the head
[2:10:37] of
[2:10:38] gold the breast of
[2:10:40] silver the thigh of
[2:10:43] brass the leg of iron and um and then
[2:10:48] and then down below was Clay
[2:10:53] now we notice that he would go ahead to
[2:10:56] um even the message of Our
[2:10:59] [Music]
[2:11:00] Generation give further interpretation
[2:11:03] to
[2:11:05] this and even Daniel himself had given
[2:11:09] interpretation and we know that this
[2:11:11] image was representing the the kingdoms
[2:11:14] of the
[2:11:18] world or maybe you want to call it the
[2:11:20] Gentile Kingdom
[2:11:24] you see that would rule over
[2:11:27] Israel and rule over in the world for a
[2:11:31] space of of many
[2:11:34] years but when these kingdoms come to an
[2:11:39] end the kingdom of
[2:11:42] God now
[2:11:44] physically no longer spiritually but the
[2:11:47] kingdom of God would physically come to
[2:11:48] the Earth
[2:11:51] at that time it was King NE
[2:11:54] Nebuchadnezzar and King Nebuchadnezzar
[2:11:57] you know the the prophet told
[2:11:59] him oh th King you are the head of
[2:12:04] God and that's why King Nebuchadnezzar
[2:12:07] now put up this
[2:12:09] image he said wow I am the head of God
[2:12:13] and and he said he put up the image and
[2:12:16] he said now I'm going to call all the
[2:12:19] people in My Kingdom
[2:12:22] including you Daniel and and all these
[2:12:25] you know we know them we call them you
[2:12:27] know
[2:12:29] uh
[2:12:32] s he see you all should come all the
[2:12:36] people in my
[2:12:37] land all the
[2:12:39] princess whoever you are when you hear
[2:12:43] the sound of the drums when you hear the
[2:12:47] sound of the symbols and you know every
[2:12:51] one of you bow
[2:12:53] down to this image because God has
[2:12:57] spoken to
[2:12:59] me that I am the head of God I want you
[2:13:03] to
[2:13:06] worship but there were people who knew
[2:13:08] they
[2:13:11] God and and sad they said we will not
[2:13:16] bow Daniel did not bow you know the
[2:13:19] story how it goes he was even taken to
[2:13:22] they were taken to the fire and he was
[2:13:24] taken to the of lions but God stood with
[2:13:28] him because yes he might have been the
[2:13:31] head of
[2:13:32] God but he was still the kingdom of the
[2:13:36] world and let me tell you one of these
[2:13:38] days the kingdoms of the
[2:13:40] world are going to be fully
[2:13:43] consumed and the kingdom of God will
[2:13:47] take over this
[2:13:48] Earth so you see then after
[2:13:51] the Babylonian
[2:13:53] Empire then came the median
[2:13:56] Empire which was the breast of
[2:14:00] silver and started with the kingdom of
[2:14:02] King
[2:14:03] Darius and then after that came the
[2:14:07] kingdom of the Grecian
[2:14:09] Empire which was the thigh of
[2:14:13] brass many of you in school have studed
[2:14:15] about uh Emperor um rather Alexander the
[2:14:19] Great
[2:14:22] and how he was very young but how he
[2:14:25] conquered almost the whole
[2:14:27] earth at young age but but you see he
[2:14:32] had
[2:14:33] anointing God had permitted him to
[2:14:36] that's why listen friends I want to tell
[2:14:38] you there is no one that can reach to
[2:14:42] Greatness except God has brought
[2:14:46] you that's why me I Marvel at
[2:14:49] people who think they can be so great in
[2:14:52] this
[2:14:53] life putting God and the word
[2:14:56] aside they don't even come to church on
[2:14:59] Sunday because they making money they
[2:15:02] want to be great they want to be
[2:15:05] something they want to be so rich you
[2:15:07] cannot be anything but what God has
[2:15:10] allowed you to
[2:15:13] be that's why you must give God
[2:15:17] time serve God first
[2:15:21] him up beyond
[2:15:23] anything beyond money Beyond power
[2:15:27] beyond culture because he is above
[2:15:30] all and he is the one who brought down
[2:15:34] Kings and lifted other
[2:15:37] kings my I wish we had time to go
[2:15:39] through this but when the time of
[2:15:42] lifting a kingdom
[2:15:45] came another kingdom no matter how great
[2:15:48] it was it had to be brought down
[2:15:53] you remember how Alexander the
[2:15:56] Great as The Story Goes how he told he
[2:16:00] told the people how he desired to be
[2:16:04] buried because he wanted to show I came
[2:16:08] to the world with
[2:16:09] nothing and I got to the world with
[2:16:11] nothing out of the world with nothing so
[2:16:14] friend what do you think you are going
[2:16:16] to seek or achieve from the
[2:16:18] world you cannot eat the whole world and
[2:16:21] finish
[2:16:22] it worship God more than
[2:16:26] anything worship God more than
[2:16:29] money God more than women more than men
[2:16:32] more than your job more than anything
[2:16:36] because God is above
[2:16:38] all some people think that we are here
[2:16:42] because we are fools but they are fools
[2:16:44] not to
[2:16:46] understand that we are here to worship
[2:16:49] The God Who is above all
[2:16:52] The God Who can lift and The God Who can
[2:16:55] cast down the God who can bless and The
[2:16:58] God Who can cast you go and read in the
[2:17:02] book of um I think
[2:17:05] theonomy chapter 28 you will realize it
[2:17:09] is God who blesses and it is God who
[2:17:12] cures praise the name of the Lord and
[2:17:15] then he speaks of after that the Roman
[2:17:19] Empire which was the leg of
[2:17:23] iron and this continued on for many
[2:17:26] years and by the way every one of these
[2:17:30] kingdoms almost ruled the whole
[2:17:35] world all right and now we see down here
[2:17:40] the last Kingdom to
[2:17:43] come the last Kingdom to rule the
[2:17:46] world in this image that nebz saw
[2:17:51] will be uh the the leg and the leg of
[2:17:57] iron but the
[2:18:00] feet which is the very last portion the
[2:18:02] very last
[2:18:05] part brother Dixon are you hearing what
[2:18:08] I'm saying the feet will be the feet of
[2:18:13] clay and the
[2:18:15] leg will be that of iron so meaning
[2:18:20] romanism
[2:18:23] continues until the
[2:18:26] end
[2:18:27] but right at the
[2:18:30] end there will be some other
[2:18:34] Kingdom which will not be entirely
[2:18:37] different but it will work with
[2:18:40] romanism because there will be iron and
[2:18:42] Clan they cannot
[2:18:45] mix but they're
[2:18:47] together what is what what is that
[2:18:50] Kingdom
[2:18:52] this is going to be
[2:18:55] Catholicism and
[2:18:59] protestan now I told you I I I I I I
[2:19:03] told you I'm not teaching but at least
[2:19:05] listen to this
[2:19:07] part
[2:19:09] understand
[2:19:10] romanism people are saying oh Russia oh
[2:19:14] this one we have had a prophet in our
[2:19:17] generation and he has told us it is
[2:19:21] romanism going to take over the
[2:19:25] world it's not
[2:19:27] Nazism it's not communism is
[2:19:31] romanism and they're going to rule the
[2:19:33] world in the end
[2:19:35] time it will be the last last
[2:19:38] Kingdom but at the end of it it will
[2:19:41] have some
[2:19:42] clay that is the other because we know
[2:19:46] that the Roman
[2:19:48] Empire the Bible speaks of it in the
[2:19:50] book of
[2:19:52] reation how it was a
[2:19:55] beast and then it was
[2:19:58] wounded but he did not die what is it it
[2:20:02] is the Roman
[2:20:04] Empire which at one time was ruling the
[2:20:06] whole
[2:20:08] world but it was ruling the world as a
[2:20:10] political
[2:20:13] power listen the political power of
[2:20:17] Rome ceas to be it fin
[2:20:21] the
[2:20:23] died but that Beast never
[2:20:25] died he came back again now in the form
[2:20:29] of religious
[2:20:33] Rome so we still have
[2:20:35] romanism it is now
[2:20:39] religious but later on in the very end
[2:20:44] we would see another part of
[2:20:46] it play which is the protestantism
[2:20:51] those who protested the Roman Catholic
[2:20:57] movement they had their many
[2:20:59] groups but listen to me church this is
[2:21:04] prophetic God is groups would B
[2:21:08] themselves up
[2:21:10] together all these Protestant
[2:21:14] movements right from the
[2:21:16] Anglican to the you know nazarin
[2:21:23] name them what even
[2:21:26] P they would all before it even
[2:21:30] happened William Bram prophesied that
[2:21:34] there will be a one world
[2:21:38] order and the power that will be at that
[2:21:41] time it will
[2:21:44] unite all the churches
[2:21:47] together into what we call the worldwide
[2:21:51] counc of
[2:21:54] churches are you hearing
[2:21:57] me the world counil of
[2:22:01] churches what why do they
[2:22:04] unite they are saying they uniting for
[2:22:07] peace for love and for Unity but they
[2:22:11] don't know they are here to fulfill
[2:22:15] prophecy because they are the gra
[2:22:22] and how will people get the mark of
[2:22:24] the by joining those religious
[2:22:29] movements by the right hand of
[2:22:32] Fellowship the Bible say they got it by
[2:22:34] the right
[2:22:36] hand on the forehead they don't they
[2:22:39] don't play Mother of God for
[2:22:43] us but they
[2:22:46] agree with the one who
[2:22:49] does and by so doing the members under
[2:22:53] that those kind of
[2:22:54] movements all of them that join the
[2:22:56] council
[2:22:58] churches they end up receiving the mark
[2:23:01] of
[2:23:02] the you better hear me while you can
[2:23:06] because time is coming when you won't be
[2:23:07] able to
[2:23:09] hear they will receive the mark of the
[2:23:11] be by joining those false Church
[2:23:15] systems but then we
[2:23:17] see that you know the Catholic
[2:23:22] denomination is not a member of the
[2:23:25] Council of
[2:23:28] churches did you know but yet the
[2:23:33] chairman of the
[2:23:35] council reports to the
[2:23:39] pope every once a
[2:23:42] year what is
[2:23:45] that
[2:23:47] romanism and protestantism
[2:23:52] iron and Clay they can't
[2:23:56] mix the Protestants can't become
[2:23:59] Catholics but they're going to work
[2:24:02] together and they will be the last World
[2:24:10] power this is
[2:24:13] prophetic it's
[2:24:15] prophetic but for us we just want to
[2:24:17] come to
[2:24:19] church receive
[2:24:21] miracle and you don't know where you are
[2:24:23] standing in the
[2:24:24] word you don't know where you are
[2:24:26] standing in the
[2:24:27] Prophet this is written in the Bible I
[2:24:30] wish we could have a lot of time to go
[2:24:32] deeper into those
[2:24:33] things probably in the other services we
[2:24:36] will and show you more scriptures and
[2:24:38] quotes
[2:24:41] on so Papa
[2:24:43] Rome would be the together with
[2:24:47] protestantism would be the last power
[2:24:52] to rule the world you talk about one
[2:24:55] world
[2:24:55] order one world religion who what is it
[2:24:59] going to be it's going to be
[2:25:02] Rome it's going to to rule over this
[2:25:05] world but listen to me Church by that
[2:25:08] time when they put them into full
[2:25:11] force of course we know the Council of
[2:25:14] churches
[2:25:15] already they already here by the time
[2:25:18] brother bam spoke about it
[2:25:21] the people of that time said no it's not
[2:25:23] going to
[2:25:24] happen and the people who said it's not
[2:25:26] going to
[2:25:27] happen they the very ones who joined
[2:25:32] it they're all a part of
[2:25:35] it I wanted to give you more details but
[2:25:37] it take more
[2:25:38] time they're all a part of
[2:25:41] it and and and this
[2:25:44] move the
[2:25:46] purpose is to rule the whole world
[2:25:50] will but by the time they exercise their
[2:25:54] power the bride will be out of
[2:25:58] here they are the ones going to
[2:26:01] persecute the foolish
[2:26:05] virgins why do why do you think that
[2:26:08] they're trying to unite the
[2:26:10] churches why is it
[2:26:12] necessary recently here even here they
[2:26:15] were saying oh give us power you know to
[2:26:19] unite and and let us pass this
[2:26:22] bill and then what is their motive every
[2:26:26] church one of the things they had on
[2:26:27] their
[2:26:30] list number
[2:26:32] one we should not accept any
[2:26:35] church to
[2:26:37] operate if their church does not have at
[2:26:41] least one acre of
[2:26:45] land they know they are the ones with
[2:26:47] the money
[2:26:51] number one number
[2:26:52] two we don't want to accept any
[2:26:56] preacher to preach unless he has he has
[2:26:59] gone to a Theological
[2:27:02] Seminary who has a theolog
[2:27:06] seminaries the
[2:27:08] tarians and they tell you you have to
[2:27:10] join oural
[2:27:13] seminar we approve you as a
[2:27:16] preacher and then we sanction we send
[2:27:18] you
[2:27:20] so in other words if anyone is not from
[2:27:23] us they would
[2:27:27] say is not is not a true
[2:27:30] preacher he should be closed down and
[2:27:33] they will begin the
[2:27:35] persecution you think God will allow
[2:27:38] it to happen before the bride
[2:27:42] goes the bride is not going through the
[2:27:46] tribulation the bride is going out of
[2:27:49] here
[2:27:50] that's why we are preaching this
[2:27:52] message because this message is
[2:27:54] preparing us for the
[2:27:57] Rapture it is preparing us to God to get
[2:28:00] to God of
[2:28:01] here and we see these
[2:28:04] kingdoms will rule over the world they
[2:28:07] are human kingdoms they are human powers
[2:28:11] they gentle
[2:28:12] kingdoms they rule over the world but
[2:28:16] listen to me now he said there was a
[2:28:18] stone
[2:28:20] that was cut without
[2:28:23] hands and it came
[2:28:25] down amen it came dangling
[2:28:28] down and it smart this
[2:28:32] image and it smart this image upon his
[2:28:35] feet where of clay and iron and clay and
[2:28:38] break them to
[2:28:41] Pieces it came and HD it right at the
[2:28:43] end
[2:28:45] here hallelujah hallelujah praise the
[2:28:49] Lord
[2:28:51] well brother Dixon you have to stand
[2:28:55] up praise
[2:28:58] God some of you people who are doing you
[2:29:01] you're taking but deacons give me people
[2:29:03] who are not doing right here cuz I I
[2:29:04] don't want my anointing to be squeezed
[2:29:11] by I'm sorry I had to do that because
[2:29:15] the young man is really
[2:29:17] disturbing all right
[2:29:21] I'd like you to look at verse
[2:29:24] 35 then was the
[2:29:26] iron the clay the brass the silver the
[2:29:31] gold broken to pieces
[2:29:34] together they became like the cha of the
[2:29:37] summer threshing
[2:29:39] floors and the wind carried them
[2:29:42] away that no place was found for
[2:29:45] them and the small
[2:29:50] that which shall not be
[2:29:55] destroyed 7:14 Daniel 74
[2:30:20] by the way do you know the interesting
[2:30:22] part is do you know when that kingdom is
[2:30:23] going to be set
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:26] up in verse 44 he says and in the days
[2:30:29] of these Kings shall the god of Heaven
[2:30:31] set up a
[2:30:38] kingdom which shall never be
[2:30:42] destroyed praise the name of the Lord by
[2:30:45] the way that kingdom is already being
[2:30:47] set up today
[2:30:50] the days of these
[2:30:52] Kings the kingdom of God is being set
[2:30:55] up but that kingdom is
[2:30:58] eternal that Kingdom shall never be
[2:31:01] destroyed that Kingdom you want to be a
[2:31:03] part of
[2:31:05] it you know he says how shall we inherit
[2:31:07] the
[2:31:08] Kingdom you know in in the Book of John
[2:31:11] 3 he says You must be born again born of
[2:31:15] the water and born of the
[2:31:17] spirit but many people don't want to be
[2:31:19] a part of the
[2:31:21] so in other words here he says that um
[2:31:25] and there was given him
[2:31:29] dominion and glory and a
[2:31:32] kingdom so now Dominion is a
[2:31:36] rule so here is the rule of
[2:31:40] Christ and he says the rule of Christ is
[2:31:42] an everlasting
[2:31:45] rule his kingdom shall never be
[2:31:48] destroyed but you see the one that is
[2:31:51] talking
[2:31:53] about he came here on
[2:31:56] Earth in the form of Jesus but you know
[2:31:59] when he was here was he surrounded by
[2:32:05] friends he was surrounded by
[2:32:08] enemies people that claim to love him
[2:32:12] but these are people who hated him these
[2:32:15] are people who are planning everything
[2:32:17] to try and bring him down
[2:32:21] I wanted to look at Matthew 28 for
[2:32:24] example before he could
[2:32:27] rain here is what happened to him then
[2:32:31] sayith he unto them my soul is exceeding
[2:32:34] exceeding sorrowful even unto death tell
[2:32:37] ye here and watch with
[2:32:42] me and he went a little farther and fell
[2:32:45] on his face and prayed saying oh my
[2:32:47] father if it be possible let this cup
[2:32:50] pass from
[2:32:55] me the L not as I will but as thou
[2:32:57] [Music]
[2:32:59] wit and he cometh unto the disciples and
[2:33:01] find them
[2:33:03] asleep and said unto Peter what could ye
[2:33:06] not watch with me one
[2:33:11] hour listen to me
[2:33:13] Church praise the name of the Lord
[2:33:16] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[2:33:18] name of the Lord
[2:33:20] well I want you to follow me now because
[2:33:23] what whatever God gave me on my heart I
[2:33:25] believe is for you this
[2:33:27] morning you know we talking about the
[2:33:30] king before he could
[2:33:33] Reign Jesus before he could
[2:33:36] reain he had
[2:33:38] friends but his friends abandoned
[2:33:41] him you know the Bible says here he was
[2:33:44] exceedingly
[2:33:46] sorrowful when you are sorrowful that's
[2:33:48] when you need friends
[2:33:51] when you are s for that's when you need
[2:33:52] someone to encourage
[2:33:55] you so Jesus was in
[2:33:58] sorrow the Bible says he went
[2:34:01] somewhere together with the disciples
[2:34:04] and he went a little further and he fell
[2:34:05] on his
[2:34:07] face and he began praying he says father
[2:34:11] if it be possible and remember these are
[2:34:15] the times I don't know how many of you
[2:34:16] have ever been in need
[2:34:20] when you really feel you are in
[2:34:23] need when you feel you need
[2:34:25] support when you feel you need help you
[2:34:29] need
[2:34:30] encouragement Jesus was also in that
[2:34:33] moment but how was his
[2:34:36] moment he picked a few not
[2:34:39] everybody only a few he could really
[2:34:42] trust and call his
[2:34:43] friends he let us go together you
[2:34:47] comfort me as we pray but as he fell on
[2:34:50] his face and began praying these ones
[2:34:54] began
[2:34:57] snoring are those really
[2:34:59] friends they abandoned him he needed
[2:35:03] them but they abandoned him I don't know
[2:35:07] here how many have ever been abandoned
[2:35:08] by
[2:35:10] friends when they abandon you what do
[2:35:13] you do you begin cursing you begin
[2:35:16] making
[2:35:18] declarations this person I will
[2:35:20] never but is that the attitude of
[2:35:23] Christ he realized he needed them even
[2:35:26] when they
[2:35:27] [Music]
[2:35:28] abandoned this Jesus was betrayed by his
[2:35:33] disciples he was betrayed by his
[2:35:36] friends where he yet spake Behold a
[2:35:39] multitude and he that was called
[2:35:42] Judas one of the 12 went before them and
[2:35:47] Drew near unto Jesus
[2:35:50] to kiss
[2:35:52] him but Jesus said unto him Judas bet
[2:35:57] thou the son of man with a
[2:36:00] kiss I want you to follow me Church see
[2:36:03] Jesus here with somebody that you could
[2:36:07] call a
[2:36:09] friend a
[2:36:12] brother but let me ask you a question do
[2:36:15] you think Jesus did not actually know
[2:36:17] what Judas was doing
[2:36:21] but he went behind him and he
[2:36:25] connived and how many times we see that
[2:36:28] in our
[2:36:30] generation someone you call a
[2:36:34] friend you are standing right
[2:36:37] here but they come right behind
[2:36:39] you and they begin
[2:36:42] conniving you think they are your
[2:36:44] friends do you know can you imagine this
[2:36:47] man you know what he did is a very bad
[2:36:50] man he's actually you just pay me I'll
[2:36:54] deliver him to you and then they pay him
[2:36:57] says you don't
[2:36:59] want and then he comes when he's coming
[2:37:03] he's not coming to you as an enemy many
[2:37:07] of your enemies are your
[2:37:12] friends that's why the devil is fighting
[2:37:14] this someone because I'm going to preach
[2:37:16] it sister fortunate until the
[2:37:18] end because
[2:37:20] this is one of the truth in the
[2:37:22] scripture that if you know you some of
[2:37:25] you have stress it will
[2:37:27] go and then he comes my
[2:37:33] friend you know I love you but he said
[2:37:36] wait a moment this is how you are
[2:37:39] betraying the son of man with
[2:37:43] a what did Judas
[2:37:46] say does any of us know what Judas said
[2:37:50] he did not repent he did not say no I'm
[2:37:53] not
[2:37:54] betraying he kept
[2:37:57] quiet none of the people
[2:38:00] there knew what Jesus said to
[2:38:03] him he walked
[2:38:06] silently but he knew what he had done he
[2:38:09] betrayed him your
[2:38:12] friends can be your enemies that you
[2:38:14] don't
[2:38:16] know but do you know that actually Jesus
[2:38:19] did not want Judas but he needed
[2:38:24] him you need your
[2:38:28] enemies if you don't have an enemy you
[2:38:30] can't
[2:38:32] Prosper if you don't have enemies you
[2:38:34] can't go from point A to point
[2:38:39] B let me explain Jesus came in the world
[2:38:44] with one one goal with One Vision with
[2:38:47] one mission is to die for The
[2:38:50] Sinner he came to die for us he came to
[2:38:54] die in our
[2:38:55] state but how could he
[2:38:57] die without
[2:38:59] Judas he needed
[2:39:03] Judas but Judas was an enemy in a
[2:39:06] friend's
[2:39:08] skin you need your
[2:39:11] enemies for God to lift you to another
[2:39:15] level you need your
[2:39:17] enemies for God to take you Amen to
[2:39:19] fulfill your life's
[2:39:21] purpose you need your
[2:39:24] enemies I want you to think as we
[2:39:26] continue imagine a world where you are
[2:39:30] alone
[2:39:31] sister and you have everything you
[2:39:35] need you don't have anyone to be with
[2:39:37] you you don't have anyone to talk bad
[2:39:40] about you you don't have anyone to say
[2:39:43] any bad word you don't have anyone to
[2:39:45] say he will never prosper
[2:39:49] have anyone to say you will always
[2:39:51] remain in the same
[2:39:52] level imagine that it will be a boring
[2:39:57] world you have everything you
[2:39:59] need you have an
[2:40:02] airport with your private J you don't
[2:40:05] have a pilot you are your own pilot you

[2:40:14] cars you have houses you have no family
[2:40:17] you have no enemies only are by
[2:40:20] yourself you say take
[2:40:23] thees give me a word with
[2:40:26] people but I don't want a world with
[2:40:28] everything with no
[2:40:31] people but you can never be in a world
[2:40:33] with people without
[2:40:37] enemies never God will ensure you have
[2:40:42] enemies because he wants to bless you in
[2:40:45] the presence of your
[2:40:47] enemies your enemies are very very
[2:40:51] important hallelujah amen praise the
[2:40:54] name of the Lord all right let us
[2:40:56] continue
[2:40:57] here here Jesus was
[2:41:01] abused by people who are supposed to
[2:41:03] follow his
[2:41:06] ministry in John 8:51 say very I unto
[2:41:09] you if a man keep my
[2:41:12] saying he shall never see
[2:41:15] death then said the Jews unto him
[2:41:19] we know you have a
[2:41:20] devil Abraham is dead the prophets and
[2:41:24] and and thou sayest if a man keep my
[2:41:26] saying he shall never
[2:41:29] tou Jesus said unto them ver I say unto
[2:41:33] you before Abraham was a young then took
[2:41:36] they up stones to cast at him but Jesus
[2:41:41] hid
[2:41:42] himself and went out of the
[2:41:44] temple going through the midst of
[2:41:47] them and passed
[2:41:50] by praise the name of the Lord these are
[2:41:53] people who were
[2:41:55] Jews who are supposed to believe him who
[2:41:59] are supposed to follow him but they the
[2:42:02] very ones abusing
[2:42:07] him that's why when you hear a
[2:42:10] preacher saying me I'm no longer
[2:42:12] preaching because I've been abused
[2:42:15] they've not confirmed their calling
[2:42:20] you have to have them they must abuse
[2:42:23] you they are very
[2:42:25] important your abusers are very
[2:42:29] important I don't know how many here
[2:42:31] have been
[2:42:32] abused your abusers have a part to
[2:42:36] play they on a mission in your
[2:42:40] life you may know it you may not know
[2:42:43] it but let me tell you you're moving
[2:42:46] ahead because of your abusers
[2:42:50] if they had not abused Jesus he would
[2:42:53] have remained in the same
[2:42:54] place but whether they abuse him or not
[2:42:58] he is still the king whose kingdom will
[2:43:01] be
[2:43:03] Everlasting whether they abuse him or
[2:43:05] not his kingdom was the
[2:43:07] storm that and struck the image and it
[2:43:11] grow bigger and bigger and cover the
[2:43:14] whole
[2:43:15] earth the kingdom of Jesus will cover
[2:43:18] the whole
[2:43:20] in the Millennium he is going to
[2:43:24] rule the whole world but here they
[2:43:27] saying you have a
[2:43:28] devil he didn't go to prove
[2:43:32] himself when someone abuses
[2:43:35] you and and and kicks
[2:43:38] you don't begin folding your
[2:43:47] shirt that is what you a Believer is
[2:43:50] easily
[2:43:52] provoked don't be provoked
[2:43:55] brother don't be provoked
[2:43:57] sister you should know who you are your
[2:44:01] enemies are important in your
[2:44:04] life let them not bring you to their
[2:44:08] level let them do their
[2:44:11] job while you are also doing your job
[2:44:14] while they were abusing Jesus he was
[2:44:17] very busy progressing
[2:44:19] he simply told them who he was he said
[2:44:23] before Abraham was I am they they said
[2:44:27] now we shall Stone
[2:44:29] you he he did not tell them you don't
[2:44:32] know I am let me show
[2:44:37] you he didn't do that but what did he do
[2:44:41] he knew he needed them just
[2:44:45] himself
[2:44:47] and just
[2:44:51] over and then he came back and with his
[2:44:55] powers he passed through them un
[2:44:59] recognized he didn't kill them but how
[2:45:02] many of you feel like you should kill
[2:45:05] your
[2:45:07] enemies and you find someone with a lot
[2:45:09] of H and
[2:45:10] bitterness some of them they can't even
[2:45:13] breathe properly
[2:45:20] if I see
[2:45:22] them show
[2:45:26] them anger bitterness you don't know who
[2:45:31] you are but if you know who you are you
[2:45:35] you will take it easy you know those
[2:45:37] people need to do what they are
[2:45:39] doing while I am doing what I am
[2:45:42] doing people will even doubt who you
[2:45:45] are they will doubt what you're calling
[2:45:49] we find it also in the ministry of
[2:45:51] Jesus one of the phes desired him that
[2:45:54] he would eat with
[2:45:56] him and he went into the Pharisees house
[2:45:59] and he sat down to meet and behold a
[2:46:02] woman in the city which was a Sina when
[2:46:06] she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the
[2:46:08] phes
[2:46:10] house WR an alabaster box
[2:46:13] of and stood At His Feet behind him
[2:46:16] weeping and began to wash his feet Fe
[2:46:19] with
[2:46:19] tears and did wiped them with hairs over
[2:46:23] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[2:46:26] them with the
[2:46:28] ointment now the phes which had be him
[2:46:31] saw
[2:46:34] it he spake within himself
[2:46:37] saying this man if he were a
[2:46:40] prophet would have known who and what
[2:46:43] manner of woman this is that touches
[2:46:46] him for she is a sinner
[2:46:49] but friends I want you to think about
[2:46:50] this
[2:46:51] for amen this is a man who called Jesus
[2:46:57] who received Jesus in his house but
[2:47:00] Jesus is there but this man is doubting
[2:47:04] the ministry and the calling of
[2:47:10] Jes oh God help preachers I don't know
[2:47:13] what is it with preachers
[2:47:15] today I feel like I'm talking about
[2:47:17] preachers today so much
[2:47:19] so much about preachers you find when
[2:47:23] when you know that someone doesn't
[2:47:24] believe in your
[2:47:26] ministry immediately you want to to to
[2:47:29] kill them you want to chase them you
[2:47:32] want to do something to them but let me
[2:47:34] tell you friend Jesus was our
[2:47:37] example he was in a church and I love
[2:47:41] Pastor I was here in the interview he
[2:47:44] spoke something about
[2:47:46] this and and now I am even getting
[2:47:48] inspired out of that as well he say that
[2:47:51] when sometimes you can be
[2:47:53] preaching and you have people in the
[2:47:56] church who don't actually even like
[2:47:59] you and you know
[2:48:02] it but you have to love
[2:48:06] them praise the name of the Lord well
[2:48:08] I'm not saying you I know you all love
[2:48:12] me and you love all the preachers
[2:48:14] here but here we are seeing the example
[2:48:17] of Jesus
[2:48:19] this is a man who called
[2:48:21] him this is a man who said he believed
[2:48:24] in
[2:48:25] him but when he came and he began his
[2:48:29] ministry he was touting who he
[2:48:32] was what are you going to do with
[2:48:35] someone you know doesn't like
[2:48:40] you many of you are employed and you're
[2:48:43] working
[2:48:44] somewhere and you have someone you know
[2:48:46] they hate you they don't like you
[2:48:49] the someone today is going down to your
[2:48:54] address you know someone doesn't like
[2:48:57] you what are you going to do are you
[2:49:00] going to hit them back are you going to
[2:49:03] help them to hit
[2:49:05] you what are you going to do you know
[2:49:08] they don't like you they even spoke
[2:49:10] against you you have the proof some of
[2:49:14] you even keep that
[2:49:16] proof you have the recording
[2:49:19] maybe some of you you even have those
[2:49:22] recordings let me keep it this is proof
[2:49:26] that he said this against at the right
[2:49:28] time I'll release
[2:49:31] it you are helping the your enemy to do
[2:49:34] his
[2:49:35] job let your enemy do his
[2:49:38] job your enemy is important in your
[2:49:42] life let them do their job while they
[2:49:46] hating you love them back
[2:49:49] the Bible says we should not be like the
[2:49:52] Pharisees who love their enemy who love
[2:49:54] their those who love
[2:49:56] them and hate those who hate them but we
[2:49:59] should love those who hate
[2:50:02] us we should not hate anybody we should
[2:50:05] let God hit our enemies on our
[2:50:09] behalf we should rule we should be
[2:50:13] Masters we should be Overcomers in the
[2:50:16] middle of our enemies
[2:50:19] the whole time Jesus was surrounded by
[2:50:22] his
[2:50:24] enemies people who seem to be more
[2:50:26] interested to finding fault in
[2:50:28] everything he
[2:50:29] [Music]
[2:50:31] did everything he saying but Jesus never
[2:50:35] once deviated away from his
[2:50:39] calling he never tried to help them do
[2:50:41] their
[2:50:42] job he kep focus on the reason why he
[2:50:46] came on Earth
[2:50:49] how many have found purpose in their
[2:50:53] life when you find purpose in your
[2:50:56] life you don't care what they say about
[2:50:58] you you don't care what they do to you
[2:51:01] you have a lot of work to
[2:51:04] do focus on why God told
[2:51:07] you focus on why you are
[2:51:10] here and your enemies love them because
[2:51:14] they are helping you to grow
[2:51:20] you just don't know it
[2:51:21] yet but they helping you to
[2:51:24] grow praise the name of the Lord when
[2:51:27] Jesus had received the
[2:51:29] vinegar he said it is finished and he
[2:51:33] bowed his head and gave up the goost he
[2:51:36] said is finished my enemies have done
[2:51:39] their job it is now mine now to do
[2:51:43] mine he went on the cross and at the end
[2:51:46] of it all he said it is
[2:51:51] finished Paul also was here on Earth and
[2:51:55] he said I fought my
[2:51:57] rest I finished my my rest and he say it
[2:52:02] is finished we should also be able to
[2:52:04] say it is
[2:52:07] finished nothing
[2:52:09] said to him changed
[2:52:15] him he was always pushing for his Divine
[2:52:18] Purpose
[2:52:21] nothing said to him or against him
[2:52:26] changed but the problem that we
[2:52:29] have many of us are changed by what is
[2:52:31] said about
[2:52:34] us we become
[2:52:36] good when someone tells you good
[2:52:39] things you become bad when someone tells
[2:52:43] you bad
[2:52:44] things but I'm here to tell you you
[2:52:46] should rule in the middle of your
[2:52:48] enemies
[2:52:50] your enemies are very very
[2:52:52] important and and the prophet says and
[2:52:54] you know most of all
[2:52:57] pictures all famous
[2:52:59] pictures before they are hung in a Hall
[2:53:01] of
[2:53:02] Fame they have to go through the Hall of
[2:53:04] critics
[2:53:06] first and then have to pass the
[2:53:10] critics and when it passes the
[2:53:13] critics then it can be hung in a hall of
[2:53:16] fa
[2:53:20] praise
[2:53:21] God when I I declare that I wanted to
[2:53:24] get
[2:53:25] married one of my
[2:53:27] friends at that time I don't know what
[2:53:30] was over him maybe an evil
[2:53:33] spirit I don't know maybe a good spirit
[2:53:36] I don't know but he came up and said you
[2:53:39] want to get
[2:53:41] married I give I give you two
[2:53:45] years two years you get married two
[2:53:48] years
[2:53:50] I passed the two
[2:53:52] years but the whole time I was not
[2:53:56] breathing I was wondering why did he say
[2:53:59] that after two years I wrote I made sure
[2:54:02] I find him I told him the two years have
[2:54:07] finished I'm beginning the third
[2:54:09] one he
[2:54:11] said the third one won't
[2:54:14] finish the third one finished
[2:54:18] and I'm still here I'll just C my
[2:54:23] 11 some of you your enemies have said
[2:54:26] you will never get
[2:54:30] married yes but I'm here to tell you let
[2:54:34] your enemies do their
[2:54:36] job if they don't say
[2:54:38] that how can God lift

[3:04:47] preaching something very practical in
[3:04:49] our
[3:04:53] lives Man was created to have
[3:05:00] dominion and the prophet says and of
[3:05:03] course when we talk about you know these
[3:05:08] things it's going to be in every part of
[3:05:11] our
[3:05:13] life as an
[3:05:15] individual family ministry business
[3:05:19] every area of our life if you can apply
[3:05:21] it you will see what I'm talking
[3:05:24] about people have a lot of
[3:05:27] heartbreaks and because of that they
[3:05:29] have a lot of
[3:05:31] enemies and because of that they spend a
[3:05:35] lot of time on speaking
[3:05:38] nonsense things which will never add a
[3:05:40] niche on
[3:05:42] them things which they don't even have
[3:05:44] to spend a minute
[3:05:45] all and they waste a lot of
[3:05:49] instead of progressing they become
[3:05:54] stagnated you see God wants to mold a
[3:05:57] character
[3:05:59] out but that character is going to come
[3:06:02] by the things you
[3:06:06] suffer you see he says um if so be that
[3:06:09] we suffer with
[3:06:11] him that we may also be glorified
[3:06:14] together for I Rec that the sufferings
[3:06:16] of this present time
[3:06:19] and not wor to be compared with the
[3:06:20] glory which shall be revealed in
[3:06:25] US unless we suffer with
[3:06:28] him unless we suffer with
[3:06:31] him we cannot re with
[3:06:33] him you have to suffer to
[3:06:38] rain everyone that has achieved
[3:06:42] something they have a story behind it
[3:06:45] but for
[3:06:46] us we want to achieve
[3:06:49] things without stories
[3:06:54] behind everyone has a
[3:06:56] story We hosted
[3:07:00] brother on the
[3:07:02] interview and he spoke very wonderful
[3:07:05] things but many of us we don't want to
[3:07:08] hear those
[3:07:09] things we are so excited with the with
[3:07:11] the current success
[3:07:14] now he a billionaire
[3:07:19] he's a
[3:07:21] billionaire and what comes in your head
[3:07:23] first I want to meet him so I ask him
[3:07:27] for
[3:07:28] [Music]
[3:07:32] some actually I I took about two three
[3:07:35] hours talking with
[3:07:37] him and after that I had many friends
[3:07:39] call me I think you are now
[3:07:45] lo I gave him
[3:07:47] he never gave me and I mean
[3:07:52] that and he didn't ask me and I didn't
[3:07:56] ask him it's me who wanted to give I
[3:08:00] give and he didn't
[3:08:02] give he knew he want to buy Church
[3:08:05] land I mean you host a message believer
[3:08:08] who is a billionaire in
[3:08:12] do normally you would
[3:08:14] say you Sur have to ask him to help
[3:08:21] that is because you see yourself as
[3:08:24] poor and you are seeing his
[3:08:28] success but you do not know the
[3:08:34] story he gave a story here and I tell it
[3:08:39] he said there was a young
[3:08:40] man who um you know was from a rich
[3:08:44] family and his father told him for me to
[3:08:47] give give you your
[3:08:49] portion I want you to go I don't
[3:08:51] remember the am
[3:08:53] $10,000 of your own so he went out and
[3:08:58] and brought the
[3:09:00] $10,000 and his father threw him threw
[3:09:03] to the
[3:09:05] fire and it
[3:09:07] burned and he said Daddy Why said go
[3:09:10] back bring another 10,000 so he went out
[3:09:15] and he brought another 10,000 and they
[3:09:17] threw it to the
[3:09:19] fire and it burned he said father
[3:09:23] why said go back bring another $10,000
[3:09:27] so this time he said the first time my
[3:09:30] mother gave me the
[3:09:32] money
[3:09:33] time again she gave
[3:09:36] me should I ask another
[3:09:38] friend is my mother's money the problem
[3:09:41] or said okay I have an idea let me go
[3:09:45] and work
[3:09:47] and and make this
[3:09:51] money blessed and she he went
[3:09:54] and did every job
[3:09:57] you and made and made money up to
[3:10:01] $10,000 he brought it to
[3:10:04] his and his father picked the money did
[3:10:08] the same thing threw it in the and as
[3:10:12] the man was going in the fire this boy
[3:10:15] did not mind about the fire
[3:10:18] he ran after the
[3:10:19] money to the fire he picked it said how
[3:10:23] can you do
[3:10:24] that my life's
[3:10:27] earnings for this money this you will
[3:10:30] not throw to the fire
[3:10:33] no this boy also had a
[3:10:38] story his
[3:10:40] success he was not going to see the
[3:10:43] criticism of his
[3:10:44] father he was not going to accept it
[3:10:48] because he was seeing the
[3:10:50] go he had a story behind his
[3:10:53] success the first money and the second
[3:10:56] money he didn't run after it because he
[3:10:59] didn't labor for
[3:11:01] it but this one he had sweated he had
[3:11:05] labed he was not going to let
[3:11:08] anyone bring it down like that he ran
[3:11:11] after it and I thought that story was
[3:11:13] very
[3:11:14] good many of you not stable
[3:11:18] Christians because you have no
[3:11:21] story you don't have no walk with the

[3:11:29] decisions that you can be proud
[3:11:32] of but some of us we have had backs
[3:11:37] because we have made
[3:11:39] decisions that we we are able Amen to

[3:19:20] God at this time by the way he's almost
[3:19:24] overthrown by his
[3:19:25] [Music]
[3:19:27] son bad things
[3:19:29] happen even to good
[3:19:32] people even to real
[3:19:34] Believers and you can have questions
[3:19:37] that don't even have
[3:19:39] answers that if it's a child of
[3:19:41] God if I'm a Child of God why did God
[3:19:44] allow this to happen
[3:19:49] David knew better never to ask such a
[3:19:54] question he began running he went into
[3:19:57] the mountains and he was with some of
[3:19:59] his
[3:20:01] generals and um when he reached
[3:20:04] there you know a man out from the family
[3:20:07] of
[3:20:08] sa his name was shim he came running
[3:20:11] after him curing
[3:20:15] him speaking casing
[3:20:18] words this is a man of God he's anointed
[3:20:22] by God he has the grace of God upon
[3:20:26] him he had a heart like that of God
[3:20:30] himself but this man
[3:20:33] comes if it was you let us be sincere
[3:20:38] how would you handle
[3:20:40] it think about
[3:20:42] it brother Alan how would you have
[3:20:45] handled that situation
[3:20:47] you are who you are but someone runs
[3:20:50] after you
[3:20:51] curing curing
[3:20:53] you speaking words that are not
[3:20:56] favorable for
[3:20:58] years many of us when something like
[3:21:01] that
[3:21:03] happens even if I'm a Believer it
[3:21:05] doesn't mean I'm stupid you stand on my
[3:21:08] feet I show you
[3:21:10] fire Brethren if you are still like that
[3:21:15] you need another touch
[3:21:17] you need another
[3:21:19] touch you need to be like David this man
[3:21:23] came curing him cing him cing him and we
[3:21:28] see that he you know and did not stop
[3:21:33] there he started throwing
[3:21:35] stones at David and at also the Servants
[3:21:39] of King
[3:21:40] David and all the people and all the
[3:21:42] Mighty
[3:21:44] Men Who were on his right and his
[3:21:48] left let me tell your enemies don't care
[3:21:51] how Mighty you
[3:21:52] are they will talk against you they will
[3:21:55] they will Cur you they will beat you
[3:21:57] with
[3:21:58] stones they will try anything they
[3:22:01] can but it TT you who knows how Mighty
[3:22:05] you
[3:22:06] are to remain
[3:22:09] composed to in your
[3:22:12] place to not cast them
[3:22:14] back to not throw back
[3:22:17] Stones am I preaching to someone here
[3:22:20] today
[3:22:22] amen and David you know and thus said
[3:22:26] shim when he
[3:22:28] cast come out come out
[3:22:35] I th bloody
[3:22:37] man and man
[3:22:40] of was
[3:22:43] he well yeah he might have been a bloody
[3:22:45] man
[3:22:47] but it was a blood man fighting the
[3:22:48] words of
[3:22:52] God so some of your
[3:22:54] criticizers will speak things which are
[3:22:56] actually
[3:22:58] true but they twist
[3:23:03] it there are people who are very good
[3:23:09] gospel but you see a
[3:23:12] gossiper does not always tell lies
[3:23:17] gossip is not always
[3:23:20] lies many times it has a lot of
[3:23:24] Truth to become
[3:23:29] gossip but the one who is saying that
[3:23:33] gossip he has a bad
[3:23:35] motive he has a bad
[3:23:37] intention and he takes that truth and it
[3:23:41] twists it by the time it comes to
[3:23:43] people's
[3:23:45] ears it sounds
[3:23:47] different it is true David was a bloody
[3:23:50] man and because of that reason God told
[3:23:54] him you will not build my
[3:23:56] temple but how was he bloody he was
[3:24:00] Bloody fighting the words of
[3:24:03] God he fought Goliath and killed him he
[3:24:07] fought the Philistines and killed so he
[3:24:10] was a bloody
[3:24:11] man but not in a wrong way he was
[3:24:15] obeying the command commments of
[3:24:18] God yes he had also committed some
[3:24:21] sin by
[3:24:23] killing it was not
[3:24:26] right and took and
[3:24:29] sto and that is the only sin of
[3:24:33] murder that
[3:24:35] God judged
[3:24:39] him and you find David praying and he's
[3:24:42] saying deliver me from my blood
[3:24:45] guiltiness
[3:24:48] so you as a Son of God it doesn't mean
[3:24:51] you are going to be
[3:24:53] perfect but when your criticizers
[3:24:56] come they will take your
[3:24:59] imperfections and make a giant of a very
[3:25:02] big rock and Mountain out
[3:25:06] of but what are you going to
[3:25:08] do some of it is truth some of it is Li
[3:25:13] but the whole idea is a li
[3:25:16] this criticism against
[3:25:18] you they are your enemies how are you
[3:25:21] going to handle them the mistake we
[3:25:24] do is to begin defending
[3:25:27] ourselves and to begin fighting to begin
[3:25:30] and in the process you also sin
[3:25:35] against but David this man was saying to
[3:25:39] you you are bloody you are bloody come
[3:25:43] out come out you are a man of B
[3:25:47] was he a man of
[3:25:49] B answer me church was
[3:25:52] he is the
[3:25:57] devil was insinuating that David was a
[3:26:00] man of of the
[3:26:04] devil I ask you church was
[3:26:08] he he was not it was a lie against
[3:26:14] David now I'm imagining
[3:26:16] if I was David what I have done at that
[3:26:20] time must have been boiling
[3:26:22] down some of you have reached those
[3:26:25] moments when people speak lies
[3:26:27] against and you're feeling your
[3:26:29] Bo you want to defend
[3:26:35] yourself one
[3:26:38] time sister peace someone said things
[3:26:42] against and wrote a very big letter and
[3:26:46] sent it to
[3:26:47] me as I was reading I was boiling write
[3:26:52] them back tell them they are lies tell
[3:26:56] them those things are
[3:26:58] lies the thing was telling me that fire
[3:27:01] in
[3:27:02] me write them back prove to them they
[3:27:07] lying against
[3:27:10] you have you ever experienced that do I
[3:27:13] have someone who has ever experienced
[3:27:16] I have friends I don't know how you
[3:27:18] handled yours but I'll tell you how I
[3:27:21] handled
[3:27:22] mine it was boiling
[3:27:25] down when you know someone is literally
[3:27:27] lying it's not the
[3:27:31] truth I took that
[3:27:35] letter the Temptation was so
[3:27:37] big should I write them back should I
[3:27:40] send them a voice note should I call
[3:27:43] them should I what should I do how
[3:27:46] should I answer so it came from how
[3:27:48] should I
[3:27:50] answer to not answer at
[3:27:54] all but the thing of of of answer answer
[3:27:58] defend
[3:27:59] yourself was so
[3:28:02] big and that's the nature of
[3:28:05] man but I took it before
[3:28:08] God threw it before him and prayed
[3:28:12] prayed prayed prayed cried and cried
[3:28:17] and by the time I went out from
[3:28:19] the that time I was in
[3:28:21] Ethiopia from the time I went out from
[3:28:24] the my problem was
[3:28:27] over my problem was over I didn't

[3:29:17] time because of the disturbances we had
[3:29:19] in the
[3:29:20] morning all right do I still have people
[3:29:23] who are following can you say Amen if
[3:29:24] you

[3:45:38] comes in a new
[3:45:41] light God prepares a table
[3:45:47] where in the
[3:45:49] middle in the middle of your
[3:45:54] enemies not away from your
[3:45:56] enemy and some of you begin praying
[3:45:59] prayers oh God Crush my enemy kill my
[3:46:03] enemy let them
[3:46:06] disappear change those prayers
[3:46:09] today let God bring your
[3:46:11] enemies because if your enemies are not
[3:46:14] there
[3:46:15] the table of Victory will not be
[3:46:18] there your table is where is with your
[3:46:22] enemies in the middle of
[3:46:25] them if you tell God to scatter
[3:46:28] them your blessings will be
[3:46:31] scattered and your table will be right
[3:46:34] there and you will take
[3:46:36] longer to attain your blessings because
[3:46:39] you have no
[3:46:41] enemies but if you have your enemies
[3:46:45] be very cautious with
[3:46:47] them because your table is right around
[3:46:51] where
[3:46:52] they
[3:46:54] Hallelujah right around where if you see
[3:46:57] someone who doesn't like
[3:46:59] you or someone who speaks bad against
[3:47:02] you or someone who resents
[3:47:05] you love that person love that person
[3:47:09] because God wants to shape your
[3:47:13] character using that very
[3:47:16] person and after he's
[3:47:19] done your table will be right there
[3:47:24] where that same same
[3:47:25] enemy who saw you doing
[3:47:28] ABCD and you overcame will be able to
[3:47:32] say he's
[3:47:35] changed and you'll be able to say the
[3:47:38] things I used to do I do them no more
[3:47:42] I'm changed I've been Reborn
[3:47:45] and you don't know the
[3:47:48] feeling of the person who said you'll
[3:47:51] never
[3:47:53] Prosper when they see you
[3:47:57] prospering some of you who have
[3:47:59] cars you always I know you always like
[3:48:02] driving around the people who said
[3:48:03] you'll never
[3:48:07] drive you to see you driving
[3:48:10] around and you even bring down your your
[3:48:13] your glass
[3:48:17] this one is laughing I think he does it
[3:48:20] and you want them to see
[3:48:30] you why because you want them to see how
[3:48:34] great your God
[3:48:36] is hallelujah the people who say you
[3:48:41] will never marry amen invite them to
[3:48:45] your
[3:48:46] wedding glory amen you invite only
[3:48:51] friends where is the
[3:48:55] F invite those ones who you thought
[3:49:01] wereing invite them to your
[3:49:04] wedding and when you are dancing
[3:49:06] and dance very well
[3:49:10] near let them see that God is preparing
[3:49:16] in the middle of your
[3:49:18] enem don't hate them love your enemies
[3:49:23] they are there to serve a
[3:49:26] purpose amen and maybe what I can advise
[3:49:30] you don't be someone who
[3:49:36] enemy because enemies are always
[3:49:41] losers you better be a friend
[3:49:45] to everyone so that they can be
[3:49:48] enemies let they be enemies but you be a
[3:49:52] friend never be
[3:49:55] found gossiping about
[3:50:01] somebody when you come at church and
[3:50:04] people who do
[3:50:05] gospel they very clever by the
[3:50:08] way they can see things even before they
[3:50:12] happen the way I see this person
[3:50:16] I think he doesn't like the other
[3:50:18] one and then he goes to the other
[3:50:23] one God bless you amen
[3:50:27] amen sister but have you ever thought
[3:50:30] about it the way I see that brother
[3:50:34] looking he doesn't seem to like
[3:50:37] you what do you
[3:50:40] think yeah by
[3:50:43] way that person
[3:50:45] even I heard
[3:50:48] words I've been telling
[3:50:50] you and then he goes
[3:50:54] back God bless you
[3:50:56] brother how are you I'm fine wanted to
[3:51:00] tell you something things
[3:51:02] but maybe let me leave
[3:51:05] it no tell
[3:51:08] me I tell you and then you begin to say
[3:51:10] that we have
[3:51:11] gossip really has come to tell you
[3:51:18] but if I tell you don't say it if you
[3:51:21] say it I will say I never said anything
[3:51:24] no problem trust me I will not say to
[3:51:29] anyone not to
[3:51:30] a all
[3:51:32] [Laughter]
[3:51:38] right so then he will
[3:51:41] start the way I see that
[3:51:45] sister she doesn't like you at all even
[3:51:48] the way even I heard her sayah blah blah
[3:51:53] blah are you sure yes people are there
[3:51:58] but people have
[3:52:02] bad but don't say I
[3:52:05] told
[3:52:06] anything and this sister go
[3:52:10] away this brother whoever brought the
[3:52:14] and now this brother who said I will
[3:52:18] never say to a
[3:52:20] soul comes to this one as soon as they
[3:52:22] tell
[3:52:24] him
[3:52:26] sister how could you say this
[3:52:28] about how who told you no but didn't you
[3:52:32] say it yes I said
[3:52:34] it not like that but who
[3:52:39] told no no problem you just know that
[3:52:41] someone told you and some would even say
[3:52:45] the Holy Spirit spoke
[3:52:47] to but you know very well it was the
[3:52:50] spirit of
[3:52:53] gossip but let me tell you brothers and
[3:52:57] sisters
[3:52:59] gossip breaks good
[3:53:04] Brotherhood go breaks the
[3:53:07] family go breaks the
[3:53:10] church even the best of friends
[3:53:14] gossip can
[3:53:18] break when someone tells
[3:53:21] you something I heard
[3:53:24] ABC me this is what I always do who told
[3:53:28] you no don't worry someone no you a
[3:53:33] gossiper if you're not telling me who
[3:53:34] told you a
[3:53:36] gossiper because you're not helping them
[3:53:39] okay okay okay so and so all right
[3:53:43] brother come
[3:53:46] come I was told that you told this
[3:53:49] brother when both of them are
[3:53:52] there before I even say what they were
[3:53:54] told their eyes already
[3:53:59] becoming because everybody knows what
[3:54:02] they
[3:54:02] said and what they added and you know
[3:54:07] the oil they
[3:54:10] put so now they will
[3:54:12] become the brother will now be shaking
[3:54:14] even
[3:54:15] sometimes I'm telling the spirit of
[3:54:18] Gossip is a very fearful
[3:54:21] Spirit when you call these people
[3:54:24] together we have literally seen them
[3:54:27] they even physic begin
[3:54:30] shaking until I tell the person
[3:54:34] relax no one is going to kill you and
[3:54:37] then you see them
[3:54:38] relaxing shaking is small
[3:54:42] small and then
[3:54:45] him you this one told me you said this
[3:54:50] did you say it many times I've watched
[3:54:53] in a
[3:54:54] distance I
[3:54:57] never you leave them to fight for
[3:55:01] a they will never
[3:55:03] agree who said
[3:55:07] what so what is it none of them said
[3:55:10] anything it was the spirit of gossip
[3:55:16] it's a very bad
[3:55:18] Spirit don't subscribe to
[3:55:23] it it breaks it will break you you will
[3:55:27] some people have even made themselves
[3:55:30] pastors others have made themselves
[3:55:32] deons others have made themselves you
[3:55:35] know some minister of some
[3:55:37] sort meaning handling matters which are
[3:55:39] never in their office
[3:55:45] and now others because they received
[3:55:49] gossip they feel they have
[3:55:53] enemies so now to I hope there is no
[3:55:56] gossiper in the
[3:55:58] church and I hope those of you have been
[3:56:01] having
[3:56:02] enemies from today you are going to love
