[Music] jesus [Music] is is [Music] amen [Applause] [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] keeping me [Music] is [Music] [Music] amen amen [Music] praise the lord you come i ever see uh i i'm teaching this evening i was expecting more than i see now but then travis let's go to the book so i'm teaching today on the qualifications and duties of deacons [Music] and so we take acts you know the book of acts is the only book which was written by the holy spirit the only book that is continuous [Music] which means that a man full stop i mean actually i mean means it's like a full stop chilling what has been like when you finish to pray you say but every other book has amen but the book of acts doesn't because there is no full stop on it and the rest of the chapters of that book is being written actually in our lives [Music] when the number of the disciples was much blind there arose a murmuring of the christians against the hebrews because their widows were neglected in the daily administration then the 12th called the multitude of the disciples unto them and said it is not reason that we should leave the word of god and sub tables one of our brethren looking out among you you seven men of honest report full of the holocaust and wisdom whom we may appoint over the this business but we will give ourselves continually to prayer and to the ministry of the world [Music] amen father we just appreciate you for the word which we have read may you bring your spirit upon it tonight as we hear these all the words in jesus christ we may be serious so this evening i'm speaking on the qualifications and the duties of of deacons i'm going to ask you to send this service to them so that they can be able to hear it those who can listen to audio send them audio those who can't send them videos okay amen now we are talking about that so let's just find the right place and so because if you don't understand what they can what you can mean or what beacons mean then you to understand their qualifications and duties might not mean much to you can you go back [Music] or the ascension of our lord jesus and the church had now continued to grow economically initially it was only the 11 disciples that he left behind but then they continued on with nursing and speaking about jesus things were all until at such a time when people became so many two kids and the burden was so heavy on the 11. and so they they told the people because now of course you know when whenever there is a gathering of people now there are things that you cannot avoid what are the way the interview is there are things like money eventually you can't avoid money don't say well because where you have people are thank you that people need to be taken care of better go love it is what people will give and then toward you but what they give needs to be managed but you see as the people became more young also increased and so god now instructed the disciples he says when the number of the disciples meaning the followers of jesus christ were much blind then they arrived a murmuring of the christians against the hebrews city um from the christians they kind of felt that they were neglected you know the congregation is beginning to be larger and the need there is need now a way to go how many agree with me that is true for sure so even so it was in the desire in the in the times of the disciples and so they said well for brethren among you look uh look out seven men mummy and if you want to listen again you can listen again so the number of disciples because i have too much to cover in a very short time usually on wednesday we do an hour so the number of disciples was multiplied that's number one okay man are you following me i mean number two the chocolatey the preaching ministry of where is that he needed to concentrate on prayer and preaching while all right amen that's point number two point number three there was need for support why would we have there was would support the preaching ministry of where is that these men that that he told them to choose their purpose would it be to support the preaching ministry why is businesses so the pastor of the preachers we are not going to be the one handling all those other jokes you see there were seven men because that's what they needed among them at that time happens you also have to start there and preach when you see the pressure becomes too much sometimes you think especially here in africa that you see ministry of church is a one-man ministry no two canola pasta nothing that goes on [Music] you see that is not the right mentality hey you see and there wasn't i believe as a church we need to know what does the bible say what does the message say then what should we do as a child is that right is it a truth amen i mean now i believe here we also have come to that level foreign yeah we need these men these are equals they are the ones who help in those things those are different you need to get in the same speed with me brother today i mean hallelujah amen now um we were we were three then four then five then ten then twenty then [Music] sometimes here we are 60 70. so we need deacons we and uh we'll just i would just stick with the word now i want us to first look at the qualifications okay and then we shall look at the duties i want you to look at uh the whole multitude and they chose stephen a man full of faith and the holy ghost and philip and and progress and nicano and pimon and feminas and nicolas across the light of antioch whom they set before the apostles when they had prayed they laid their hands on them uh have you corrected myself [Music] i'm asking you a question they chose seven women say deacons rather shame understand they have female deacons but according to the apostolic church women they chose what balloon that man massager so according to the apostolic church cathy can you say ever to me there is nothing like women deacons these men were men and nobody not people siban not women but they were men right i mean so we are looking at the qualifications qualification number one the transaction according to what we have read here these were men all right amen so please sister uh sister don't tell us to elect you as a deacon together and say it is not appropriate for us to neglect teaching the word of god in order to stop tables [Music] in order to serve tables and manage love and money [Applause] of the spirit and wisdom i like to do your name again we may put in charge distaste i don't know where you know so now we find out that they also have to have a wholeness report category foreign [Music] all right it says likewise master deacon's big grave not double tanked not given too much wine not greedy or filthy lacquer holding the mystery of the faith in the poor consciousness and let this also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slanderers so about faithful in all things not malicious gossips but self-controlled thoroughly trustworthy in all things okay now that is that that bit there i got from the from the amplified you just keep that then says let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children and their own house as well wherever you never wait is that chibaguan [Music] meaning servants i believe he said and he says that uh let the beacons be the grave [Music] who is hearing what i'm saying are you all with me my name is are you all with me my name is so it says let them not be double thanks [Music] they should also have ability to hold the mystery of faith from the their wife or his wife or the deacon he must she must also be great faithful in all things what does this let this mean a man who has your respect he is a honorable man financially ethical [Music] and then he does not you know pay back you see he's not an honorable man he must be financially ethical he must be of a good character not a bad character but a good character [Music] [Music] not be double times meaning speakers of half-truth you see how many have seen people who are double times is not one of the qualifications of being a deacon [Music] many churches especially down here in our continent they take people who are rich i'm against amazing is he must not be someone who is addicted to alcohol died enough he must not be greedy for this honest gain could be into [Music] but upholding and fully understanding someone who does not shy away someone who knows what he is taught what the true message is and it does not shy away from it that's a question soon you know the bible says that i'm not ashamed of the gospel amen and he's not ashamed of it such a person commenting hallelujah you see and and he must have full understanding of the mystery [Music] [Music] resulting from behavior consistent with spiritual maturity this man it's not like saying well i have a good spirit hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord so now this that's why we should appreciate god for this anti-message because anger this message has made many has made many things clear to be injured in the world out there when you find women they are placed as different oh sangha because and yet the bible is clear at the bible the bible says even so much their wives a woman can also be a deacon but according to the kjv he says the wife of the deacon is so [Music] if he has no qualifications so it's not about woman about the qualifications of the bible that's why we do not need the physical body jesus he has no new thing to say nothing forget about the thing he had to say there are nothing he's right here in bible hallelujah amen and that's why you on the must be happy if you receive the revelation of this bible when you receive the revelation of the word no quick quote you gotta receive christ from christo amen that's why the apostles say that to me this is an angel who comes from heaven and preaches to you now of god we don't take it as a book of consultations of our faith oh god that's that god i don't know you know the bible bible jesus christ can you explain for me hallelujah [Music] let the woman land in silence with all subjection you must not be [Applause] [Music] that this god of the bible oh no our bible that's not discriminate that's so solar but also this god of the bible does not advocate for equality [Music] [Applause] praise the lord so that's the god of the bible says that a deacon must be a man not a woman and if he's a man just a man his wife also must be uh worthy of respect i um some three of my sisters actually many sisters sister they like gossiping you know things come from this home again she you know there are people who love even taking things of their bedroom of their house out into the public shc [Music] she must be those are the foreign [Music] he says and god has said in the church some apostles secondary prophets gifts and so forth in the church for one purpose the perfecting of the body and now if you happen to get sick cat is single whatever you are you're not jody and your pastor is a man who believes that we should pray for the sick your kids have him come and pray for him but and then if your pastor is not there get then get [Music] he actually can't be able to also pray for you just like your pastor can pray for you if your person is not there um amen all right so then i'm just going going quickly through it if you i'm also recommending you read a message um and i think that your meeting should not be together should not be together but it should be as each office because the deacons has nothing to say to the trustees unless they got some business to present to them now these deacons don't have uh you know we have the we have different offices category in our offices we have the offices of the trustees and then the office of the deacons now how many are learning things that things today are you learning i know you are used to me preaching my name can be boring financial business [Music] assisting the past and so it says that when they are meeting it doesn't have to be like all the all of them made in today of the church how many are ugandans uganda hallelujah mean how many are bound by the law of your career is [Music] the prime minister nathan who coming into a prime minister i said because i'm in uganda uganda the law will catch up with me but do you know who will arrest me [Music] now police policy is mandated by law um police police has sometimes they're women stand there i made it out and they just do like this without much difference and all the cars a motocross [Music] this woman of man oh my god is exercising authority over that the government has given the government you can't knock on them if you in the church mechanism we have our punishment truly never receive our faith the whole kingdom of heaven is behind them when a man stands as a beacon oh my god i mean i'm going to do it and he tells you brother all uganda can you please take that seat leave this city and he too must know his rights that way and he must exercise accordance [Music] to the law [Music] here my mom and a person possess comes to attack me i should not leave the world fighting that pastor let the deacons catch the power hallelujah the deacons are the policemen of the church and their assistance to the pastor and the trustees is the holding of all the properties [Music] the trustees has nothing to do with the spiritual end of it and the deacon has nothing to do with this financial enemy [Music] therefore it must be and the sunday school superintendent is the o is over his sunday school but praise the name of the lord come here so i want to show you i want to show you this that brother banham says he had written down all the offices in his church [Music] [Music] does not mean it means that it is self okay yes hallelujah so we are not controlled by another church somewhere give it to all right so okay then okay let it be just in one minute by the shame that you came so then he actually goes ahead and uh if you you can flip that paper and and reach the office of the deacons are you there then it begins to it says the office of the deacons as elected according to the word of god and the manner of of the church is to act as an office of spiritual assistance to the pastor again do official dean connie [Music] [Music] on all his spiritual activities they are given free speech in presenting to the pastors any program or benefits that would bless the general and spiritual welfare of the church and ready to assist the pastor or associate pastor on every duty if called to do something they must be able to teach but in you know when people come in we'll probably understand we shall be able to get into more of that you know they are the ones to guide them how they must end uh how they must act when they're in the house of the lord you shall oversee the spiritual conduct of the church in working with a pastor and one another on spiritual problems matters of the same background [Music] [Music] they shall be ready at any time to assist the need of every saint who is burdened and in need of spiritual consultation god they have not the right to act upon any program or promotion without agreement with one another the pastor or the trustees if the program they are conducting considering doing involved strategies [Music] they shall not have meeting among themselves without the pastor are present or his assistants [Music] it's not deacons don't run the church [Music] [Music] [Music] is [Music] an account together did you know that so out how old would you live so the deacons but then connie they also have to be to keep order in the church that's the beauty of the people now is there i'm quoting is there any better way to keep order in the church than to keep reminding the people with a repeat from the deacons accordingly okay your duty is to keep order in the church with a kindness [Music] because you were taken under a policeman i'm going to make to keep order in the church with kindness and friendliness then you are supposed to if someone gets out of order in the church who comes in here like a drunk or someone come in so he gives an example here like they shot that minister there is a preacher which who they shot away [Music] so he screamed for his wife and wanted his wife and went up towards the past and the pastor showed him his wife but he was going to shoot her right in the church if there had been a bunch of deacons and entered that door with that shotgun they would have had their arms around you might just can't expect anything to be normal but remember the deacons are goddess policemen in the house of god [Music] sometimes a policeman wants uh uh not to have to go up and make an arrest on somebody are you doing if someone jumps up and starts interrupting the pastor or something another like that already finally a pasta in his message the deacon supposed to walk up to the people uh two or three of them they they say could we speak to you brother bring him from the church out into the office [Music] impact they made you and if the if the deacon country is keeping that right he is also backed by the law of the country government uh me but some people i'm finishing up here now such as the liquid person or something come among you you know and some religious fanatic and start carrying on and then the deacons and if the deacons don't seem to be able to control it then the trustee but or someone else in the church can step up and give help with [Music] [Music] we are the church of jesus christ say concerns christ and the church of jesus christ must be the apostle paul said let everything be done decently and also in order um and that's why we have to learn something like this praise the name of the lord god bless you let us stand come on [Music] [Music] let us pray [Music] our precious loving jesus want to thank you so much this evening is i pray that you bless these people that you have allowed me to speak to this year lord if there be any need spiritual physical [Music] of jesus [Music] in the name of jesus there is the name of jesus it breaks everything you break every chain to break every chest break every chain break every chain to break every chain [Applause] [Music] there is power [Music]
