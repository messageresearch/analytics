up here so that everybody foreign but on 23rd this week we hit 10 years in marriage foreign [Applause] so that's the love of my mother so 10 years that's a decade in marriage and it looks like we just start getting started love is a beautiful thing because he has been with us he has been so real to us he has made this marriage so beautiful amen it's not just been a marriage it's been a Ministry you know the Lord has accomplished a lot in our 10 years together on our honeymoon I got this Grace uh the message went to Ethiopia already you know we went there for our honeymoon but there was no message church at the time so God you know began to connect us to people and we were very busy with our honeymoon but also very busy with Outreach and I tell you that this woman God used her um you know we had one room which had a kitchen and a bathroom so when people come in behave as if she has gone to the washroom of course we had just gotten married so I didn't really know her very well so you need to understand this she didn't know me very well we have just been together even less than a month I was thinking she's going to the bathroom I didn't know that God was using guy in prayer and Visions while [Music] I was preaching because the message and this sister sharing with this sister my wife in the bathroom so she came out two hours later I've seen you baptize a woman and I told her of course she told me in our language so they didn't hear what I was saying so I told her praise the Lord it means this sister is going to believe I'm sure enough she believed that same night and she looked for water everywhere out of that out of what God did at that time Nina [Applause] so there is a lot to say but I don't want to make this away another wedding ceremony so we have a song we'd like to sing and we did not we did not plan for it we did not practice it so forgive us if we if it doesn't go very much it's about saying that all is well what the Lord has done for us and it's really also connected to what I'm going to share with you today I'll begin with the first stanza just listen to those words and then my wife will join me in the chorus there's a story in the Bible of Elijah ashunami to man and a son the woman found favor with God and he gave us while walking in the field the little boy died but a woman's face never failed and even in death she testified that all is with amen [Music] [Music] his words [Music] [Music] [Applause] is a place oh perfect trees [Music] now things have not worked out like God's people thought for we are still here to fight the greatest battle ever fall [Music] we must have the faith of Abraham knowing God's word never feels if you trust in him for you find that all is well how many believe that all is well yes all it is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] sorry little bright Rays amen [Music] soul rest little bride Jesus Christ is telling his little bright to rest all is well yes once again sing with me now oh all is well [Music] we have the message [Applause] where there is a place there is a place oh perfect race behind the inner bed little bright race all these ways Lord Jesus yes even Lord from a few days ago as I myself and my wife commemorate 10 years of marriage we understand that marriage here is a type of the Heavenly marriage between the bridegroom and the bride is because we can see this happen on Earth we are also sure about what would and will happen in just maybe a few moments after now foreign [Music] you can rest at your feet knowing that all is well I commit the services this morning into your hands a lot of people that you have allowed to be here and the others that are streaming with us I pray oh God bless everyone father don't let this be as if we were hearing from you this is going to the fasting of our hearts this is just come this morning and make yourself known to us in the name of Jesus Christ amen Amina kindly take your Bible with me to the Book of Ruth I have we we have been uh going through the Book of Ruth for two Services now um so this is the third service and and so today we'll be talking about resting together we read chapter 2 on Wednesday but let us we finished we read up to verse 18. so I'm requesting We Begin fast from Verse 18 to 23 and then we shall go to chapter three amen Ruth chapter 2 verse 18. and she took it up and went into the City and her mother-in-law saw that she had gleaned and she brought forth and gave to her that she had reserved up to her that she had reserved after she was surfaced and her mother-in-law said unto her where has thou gleaned today and where wrote it thou Blessed Be he that did take knowledge of thee and she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had wrote and said the man is name with whom I wrote Today is boys and Naomi said unto her daughter-in-law Blessed Be of the Lord who has not left of his kindness to the living and to the Dead and Naomi said unto her the man is near of kin unto us one of our next Kinsmen and Ruth the more by the said he said unto me also Thou shalt keep fast by my young men until they have ended all my Harvest and I only say down to Ruth her daughter-in-law it is good my daughter that thou go out with his maidens that they meet thee not in any other field so she kept fast by the maidens of boas to glean and to the end of body Harvest and of wheat a harvest and dwelt with her mother-in-law Young foreign amen now we you will sit and then I will read again from verses uh chapter three the first 15 verses out of uh uh Ruth chapter three from verse 1 to 15. together so because of saving on time I'll just read in English and then we'll just carry on then Naomi her mother in law say done to her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee and now is not Bowers of our Kindred with whose maidens thou asked behold he will know with Bali tonight in the threshing floor wash thyself thereof and anoint thee and put thy remainment upon thee and get thee down onto the floor but make note thyself known unto the man until he shall have done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lies down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what Thou shalt do and she said unto her all that thou sayest unto me I will do and she went down unto the floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law paid her and when boas had eaten and drank and his heart was merry he went to lie down at the end of the Heap of corn and she came so softly and uncovered his feet and laid her down and it came to pass at midnight that the man was afraid and turned himself and behold a woman lay at his feet and he said who what though who at thou and she answered I am Ruth thine handmade spread their father is cut over thine handmaid for thou utter near Kinsman and he said blessed be thou the Lord my daughter for thou has showed more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning in as much as thou followest not younger men where the poor or Rich and now my daughter fear not I will do to thee all that thou requires for all the city of my people that know that thou art a virtuous woman and now it is true that I am like near Kinsman and how big there is a Kinsman near nearer than I tarry this night and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform unto thee the part of a king's man well let him do the king's man the king's man is part but if he will not do the part of a king's man to thee then will I do the part of a king's man to thee as the Lord liveth lie down until the morning and she lay at his feet until the morning and she rose up before one could know another and he said let it not be known that a woman came in to the floor also he said bring the veil that thou Hast upon thee and hold it and and when she held it he measured six measures of body and laid it on her and she went into the city praise the Lord Ruth the moabitus Lucy um today we are speaking on resting it's quite a lot that we can be able to be able to book really the Twins and in every service I've been able to cut it short but uh I've not been able to cover everything and that's why I'm requesting and I requested each of you to go and listen to the message the Kinsman reduced so I don't know how many have listened to it if you've not listened to eat please go and listen to the message it was preached in 1960 I heard someone say they didn't have a code for the message they called it 60-10-0-2 I mean so go on please listen to it begins zero two all right so the king the Ruth the more about this is our subject and our topic today is so now we've seen that there are four phases of Ruth and we see this clear in the Book of Ruth and the first one is deciding the second one is working the third is resting is so we talked about Ruth deciding try again and of course we saw that Ruth is the type of the church and every man that comes to Jesus must decide to follow Jesus when you have no hope for things to be better but because you have made up your mind to follow Jesus you have faith in what he will do for you you have faith in Redemption but you have no proof of redemption do you know about every one of us needs to be redeemed every one of us the Bible says we were born in sin we come to the world speaking lies so we need to be redeemed so I will need to make a decision decision is the very first place now remember when you make a decision you still have the desires that you had before you still have the desires of the things of the world you still had everything that everybody else has in the world so you don't decide to follow Jesus because we have already overcome because you were Superman or a superwoman you decide to follow Jesus because you love him with everything in you amen so Ruth made her decision but all Pakistan Naomi and said and she said I'm sorry because at first at first both her and Ruth were saying no we shall follow it is highly unlikely she might become pregnant but even if she became pregnant it is highly unlikely have twins would have to be both boys so now when all pass out about it she said surely this way is unrealistic according to a thing and she was not ready to bet with her and make up that decision [Applause] foreign foreign [Applause] foreign you are in the field of describe not by coincidence Hallelujah and so at that moment Serge Hallelujah man Ruth Ruth began grinning boys his eyes you had many sisters we are going to foreign you see even if they're losing slap them together come on tell somebody until you tell somebody tell them you are Ruth what was she doing she was cleaning let me tell you any man that comes to the Lord must be willing to stop you cannot just sit in the church you cannot do that find something for the Lord amen song give your money why are you saying that is serving also if you can't do that on the streets if you can't do that pass the track to somebody there is more you can do for somebody to make yourself busy don't come here just to sit take care we come here to serve the Lord come and serve with me by saying amen by saying yes we are serving together you know told them leave something foreign his [Music] mercies are new foreign [Applause] that is why the Bible says one man said I've been oh I've been young and now I'm old I've never seen the righteous beg for praise let me tell you God may never give you all the things you ask for your name but one thing God will make sure that you have food hey yes not spiritually physically [Applause] that's what God promised you will not go to bed for chicken salad if you want chicken chicken foreign [Music] I might preaching to someone watch God make him two fish more we can multiply because they promise foreign and so Ruth the more about us here you say that you never went with other men one how you get them again did you know that a woman at the intention and the purpose of God listen Church did you know the purpose of God is for a girl to get married when she's still virtuous money that's the purpose of God in fact in the Old Testament there was no room for an uh a girl who was not virtuous to get married there was no room it was even difficult for a Girl Like Ruth was a virtuous but [Music] she was a widow she was known by another man so there was no way it had to be a man from The Lion age of the man that married her before that was called the Kinsman ridiculous meaning the Redeemer from the lineage of his of our former husband that's why even the Bible says let fornication never be had among you the Bible is as a matter of fact the Bible Bible sees all sins the same Bible you believe you'll never never be found foreign I want us to see that Ruth is the type of the church as Ruth goes for through four stages the church we must also go through four stages of God is Grace goes through deciding uh serving resting and being rewarded Lucia where is in the same way the church must go through justification do you know that the Bible doesn't speak about other planets foreign [Applause] um what is happening life is fixing to come in the same way Cyclones we are seeing it happening everywhere are you not seeing it on the news amazing [Applause] you [Applause] know was all over the place let me tell you the whole place will be prepared just for the bride and the bridegroom to live on this Earth is the name of the Lord do you understand what I'm talking about and in the same way foreign he says in the message the kinsman redeemer waiting for that hour agament Al news and we typed it up with Ruth deciding Ruth was serving and Ruth wrestling deciding was justification and sanctification resting was the Holy Spirit until the wedding how beautiful how men are waiting for the weddings the Bible says the marriage of the Lamb is and his bride has made us what is making the bread ready is the word making us ready the word is making you ready you know sometimes we come and sit in the church and it appears as if nothing is happening let me tell you as long as you are here something is happening and I always say whether you feel it that's why even one morning when you don't feel like coming to church yourself as long as you are under the influence of the world hey man Ruth dragged herself don't you think it was easy for her to leave everything I will tell you now if you come to Jesus whatever is you must be ready to leave everything I said foreign when you do that just when Jesus Christ will know our yes you are now ready to leave for him and the Mother-in-law said Mark the place Mark of the place you know the Mother-in-law was very very wise and she told she told Ruth here is what I'm advising you to do um you know this man that you have seen um there was someone who was near us was the next when when Naomi found out Lucy this is your moment now foreign [Music] all right okay come all right now Katie all right so this is a brother and sister no problem now here was Boaz lying and snoring me anymore does someone have a scarf can you give me a scarf all right thank you sister thank you now he said was covering himself foreign yes ah and she did exactly that and she was comfortable lying down at his feet and he looked at her he said who are you who are you and Ruth Walker Rose Omani was at that moment he knew that he was in the line of redemption yes it is until the morning after the morning foreign she will always give you food Hallelujah foreign whatever you have this morning he said he will give you yeah he's more than able and now we told the truth lie down there mark the place and the prophet says Ruth a gentile Lucy omawang excommunicated runoff has been brought in to be accepted to be accepted as bright Christ come in just at balis season I want to say also Jesus Christ has come to us yes but what the world does is he wants them to be uncovered but Christ wants you to be covered who that's a very strong statement that was the truth damn I see me that's what the devil has made the woman with all the pornography and everything you have to say with all the sexuality that is out there naked women pictures of women I was even in the supermarket the other times it's a public place where little children go or one of them but because they are advertising bras a woman was only eating High insides and her brothers foreign for them to realize they're naked because if they act because the Bible say Bible again when evicts so let us pass a bunch of apples for them to realize amen people that are not going to compromise let us call black black and white wine if it is wrong it is where are your friends or your sisters are doing it it still is wrong stand for what is wrong for the word when you stand for the world let me tell you what you're doing you are standing with with God himself and then you were sent out there to be a light you're not going to go and begin abusing them you know the day was deceived them some of them are children of God so what do we do we reach out to them are you hearing me we reach out to them because every girl is wearing lipsticks and painting their face it has come to a point where it is all right they think it is civilization thank God for the prophet that we have had in our generation he said it is the message going home some of them paint themselves like cats yes yes does it happen it is not money core pedico it's not those things see pedicure and a manicure it is traditional things being mean to be able but our Prophet are saying not your father it is one who doesn't know or worship Our God our God is Jesus Christ and it doesn't matter where it is done Switzerland could be in Germany not Germany if it is done it is and let me tell you no matter where it is these things were being done all over the world women have been painting themselves for ages that was before the new Christ in the Bible we see a woman called jeze she started you know influencing him to also worship she became a prophetess he became a lead of the armies and that's what the church has become today hallelujah amen Jezebel are you hearing me Jezebel yes you know she would paint herself yesi ganga please I don't usually preach these things our visitors today foreign why was Jezebel painting herself yes let's come down to that what was the reason can a woman paint herself and be in the bedroom the whole day um a woman paints herself so she can attract me if you have another reason you have to prove it but the real reason why a woman would paint herself yes that's why when they do that and they dress their their nude clothes then they don't say um I look sharp or I look smart am I success even when they take pictures this is really all meant to be sexy opposite in other words they'll try and come say come and help me and you notice whatever when Jezebel painted herself she would you know pain and then go in the mirror yesterday foreign yes she would just go there no they know her mouth her mouth is our lips are sticking out and imagine full of paint like blood and you see them doing the same thing called Snapchat what are they trying to do Jezebel spirit oh my God spirit and she was there yeah yeah foreign [Applause] [Music] and [Music] then she came out on the balcony and one man God anointed one man [Music] foreign foreign the devil is doing it out there with a lot of strengths if I'm going to stand here I'm going to answer on the day of judgment I must say what the prophet says I must say what a Vindicated you know sometimes we try to be diplomats and I even Wonder Brothers The Church of Jesus Christ become painted first by painting themselves away from the world foreign and I know there are people here who believe exactly praise the name of the Lord cover yourself why would a woman want to uncover herself and I'm not saying oh the only right way of dressing is to dress things that are going sweeping the floor you know we also have legalism the only way you can make your hair is make it going behind it's a uniform for everyone that's not where anywhere in the Bible it's not even in the message that's our sisters foreign foreign but he's winnowing Bali you know and then he says listen brother wrong he says and then Mark the place Kathy where Kanye Wadi so Naomi was telling him he's saying and then he said to her she said to her and mark the place where he lies did you do it did you also Mark the place many years ago he said many years ago I marked that place in my heart where he laid down his life Jesus foreign let us Mark that place foreign foreign and worthy and take the blanket that he was covered and pull it over here what do you think was the blanket that covered Jesus sometimes I think about it I say oh God Like That Woman by your stripes Jesus amen when I think about that Brenda helped me to mark that yeah I'll accept your suffering I'll accept the Sorrows glory to God following Jesus is not like that it's a place of self denial dying to your desires everything that take you away from here maybe every day we have to die you say friends we have to accept to die we have to accept to do that and he says oh you see I say I know you may think that I'm a fanatic but that just suits me just right that's the spirit of God Calvary Calvary where he laid down in the Tomb we are gonna be the moon and crawl up to his face there you are cover yourself I wonder how many people can say the same thing what you say I will do and by the bottom say that Naomi was a type of the Old Testament whatever you say I will do and and then he says it says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you say I will do it how many can say I will do it if it says going into the world and preach the gospel you say I will do them and get you courage if it says whatever it said Jesus Christ the same yesterday you say I will still come and get you courage the church taking its orders from the world and I want to bring you to a climax now we talk about the rest before we conclude but listen to this quote as I finish this quote from this message look this is it the church the young woman the young man the old or young is asked to separate themselves from the world and come into a place a kingdom of the Holy ghosts that is disgraceful to the world in their own heart they know what it's all about but to the world they become a fanaticians they become a Holy Roller or something on that idea not disgraceful name that's why listen listen church that's what I always say you see when we come to church if you've really lie down to that place Missouri you see you must come to that place or do not do come with you where when you worship God when you hear the word you yield yourself so much that even tears will come down you not be ashamed of him but you see what we what do we have now we have a put on religion we have a very diplomatic religion and I say even in the message where you just have to hear and just sit there and be dry as dry can be prayers as just as dry yes when you check the some when you check the temperature it is zero temperature nobody in the church can even shout Glory Hallelujah when the what is going on everybody's just dry nobody can even raise their voice no nobody can do that because it is how can they see a very a very interesting beautiful young lady shouting you know so but that what what is happening it's the wrong Spirit creeping in dry us up but what does Jesus want us to do he wants us to rest at his feet the rest is the Holy Ghost comes these things are bound to happen let me tell you when the Holy Ghost is in a church am I preaching to someone here we are going to see people running around the eyes the people crying around the tears like babies it is not emotion it is the work on the inside that is being reflected on the outside what are you going to see you're going to see mucus coming up you're not gonna have time to create yourself why why because you are so lost this is what the church is supposed to happen that is praise the name of the Lord and he says no matter by the church is asked to do it the church is don't make one bit of difference to me this oh my God stammering lips stammering lips and then he will say to them this you know what this that you have received Hallelujah is the rest in your church this is the refresh but what did they do they didn't hear it acts chapter 2 verse where they were sitting foreign Holy Ghost foreign praise the name of the Lord hallelujah oh my in a message the unfailing realities of the Living God the Bible says this is the thing that will come foreign foreign now I want to conclude today with the example of the woman with the alabaster box and instead of reading that scripture I'll just record this quote brother speaks about her uh unwelcomed Christ the prophet says the only decent thing she had about her was her long hair um and it fell down wiping his feet then was the last time amen your tears came out to wash Jesus's feet oh God I'm so wretched I'm so miserable and our Glory laying right at his feet she was wiping the feet off Glory negatively watching what a picture Jesus [Applause] [Music] don't [Music] you see what this poor prostitute was doing you know here's what I strongly believe it's not about what you have done in the past Italian I'm so sorry it has come to a place where our churches are looking for perfect people um but God is Not Looking for perfect day God is looking for people like this woman but she was ready on the feet of Jesus that's what you have in our churches that are so stretchy so holier than thou attitude of the attitude that this woman even when we go to worship this thing has disappeared let it be restored again to us this is what God is looking for he wants us little Ruth to rest at his feet help us and he says what has happened to the Past Church to say he said she was laying Everything At His Feet she wanted him to be welcome God help me to help to let him be welcome what has happened to the party the party here in other words he's talking about the church service Christo Baptist the Holy Spirit himself no matter how she gets there since so she arrives the old party that's the trouble of it today so busy with the parties and things entertainments and baseball games imagine a church organizing for young people or whoever it is to go you know socialize and do parties and things like that is you know the young people and old people are like having too much of that right the church the young people we are Desiring that real move of God to the feet of Jesus I hope that this is speaking to someone oh God help us and he says here it is the party is all broke up in color again look at them all standing around the Pharisee punched the other one um foreign indignation [Music] foreign [Music] I'm finishing right here my wife is not in the church and I can't be serious her to bring her right here but I would have told her to come and do what that woman did it is a disgrace imagine if my wife came right now she's my wife now what about if it is I'm just there India this is how it was and all the fat is the Believers man is not spiritually if you are spiritual would he not know what this woman is he didn't even move his feet yesterday if he had moved it she would have been gone um ah but afraid all kind of friend that's what the prophet is Jesus was what yes he was a Jewish he was enjoying the service to him he was enjoying somebody loving him that much he just kept Real Steel Yes and she'll take one foot and then the other quarters foreign no better this woman didn't just come at the feet of Jesus and she was just there yeah she came to me in business everybody and you know I always says foreign [Applause] thank you let me tell you don't let them intimidate you that woman was not intimidated she continued doing what she was doing Hallelujah amenities why she was resting at his face that's like Ruth was resting at his wife foreign [Applause] do you love the Lord tonight amen I'd like us to sing You Are

for five years up front because we knew maybe we're gonna be here three or five years it is but we did not have all those funds so we paid a few months and uh so now we receive the notice Katina that is increasing the rent he is 1.2 million yeah and so we called him in here and sat with him and we told him that we would his place is worth that money is but most of our Reagans are young people students and so we can't afford that at this time long story short we agreed with him that we would going forward pay 800 000 Shillings we do not know when we pay how long we pay whether he will change his mind again or not so there are two things I want to tell you one because be more serious on our land contributions so that way just to go and have our own place and then again we thought it is wise for us to pay at least at least six months to a yeah so that we know that if we pay for Aya we are not going to be disturbed we can collect our Churchland fund and then we don't know what the Lord will do within a year if within a year from now we have enough we can go to our land if not then at least we have we have had enough time to collect more funds for our Churchland yeah foreign do we understand each other so we have two options we collect what we need would be about 9.6 Millions foreign [Music] [Music] so that means we are remaining with 8.4 Millions so I'm announcing it to you this is usually a free will offering but I'd like you to know that if we do not if we do not if we don't give yeah as a church by the end of this month we shall be forced to take it to take the 8.4 out of our church landforms so the match you give towards the rent to produce how much we will be able to take out of that funds so next month we shall give you a report according to your giving on where on the status where we shall see you amen Mina so uh uh we shall also introduce by by next Sunday another bag Sunday yeah together I was speaking one of the deacons you see that certain bugs he
