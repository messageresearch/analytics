[2:17] [Music]
[2:31] hallelujah
[2:33] oh thank you Jesus
[2:36] the Bible says
[2:48] [Music]
[2:56] Matthew chapter 16. Mateo is
[3:00] I love it when we open up and just
[3:02] worship him in the spirit of Liberty
[3:09] but in heaven we will continuously do
[3:12] that
[3:15] so here we have to pause the moment and
[3:17] go to the word because the word is the
[3:18] most important thing here on Earth
[3:26] we will need it to get there
[3:30] Matthew 16 verse 13.
[3:35] all right so we're reading
[3:37] um I'm reading the name of the Lord
[3:39] Jesus came into
[3:45] arm and they said some say that thou art
[3:48] John the Baptist some Elias and others
[3:50] Jeremiah saw one of the prophets he
[3:52] saith unto them but whom say he that I
[3:54] am and Simon Peter answered and said
[3:56] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[3:58] Living God and Jesus answered and said
[4:00] unto him blessed that thou Simon by
[4:02] Jonah for flesh and blood has not
[4:04] revealed it unto thee but my Father
[4:06] which is in heaven and I say also unto
[4:09] thee Thou Art Peter and Upon This Rock I
[4:11] rebuild my church and the Gates of Hell
[4:13] shall not Prevail against it
[4:16] and I give unto thee the Keys of the
[4:18] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou
[4:20] shalt Bine on Earth shall be born in
[4:21] heaven and whatsoever thou shall lose on
[4:24] Earth shall be loosed in heaven just
[4:26] read up to verses 19.
[4:32] our yes
[5:40] amen
[5:41] you may be seated
[5:45] so this morning I'm speaking on part two
[5:47] of what I spoke on I think it was
[5:49] Wednesday or Sunday
[5:55] on the power of Revelation
[5:59] tell someone the power of Revelation
[6:04] I hear I will not take long again this
[6:08] morning maybe I'll speak for about an
[6:09] hour we usually here can preach even up
[6:12] to two hours the people here can take it
[6:13] in some Churches can not even go 30
[6:15] minutes
[6:17] foreign
[6:24] but usually I always want to do an hour
[6:27] because then people can still listen to
[6:29] you by the time you are you are done
[6:34] so uh how many are promising to give
[6:37] their undivided attention
[6:41] lay everything aside
[6:44] and at this time I'm also laying myself
[6:46] aside
[6:48] I have nothing good to tell you
[6:51] just like Jesus said without him I can
[6:54] do nothing yes
[7:12] the power of Revelation
[7:16] Jesus comes and asks and actually this
[7:19] in this scripture where we read
[7:22] this is where the whole foundation of
[7:24] the church is
[7:27] when I say the church
[7:29] I don't mean the denominations
[7:34] this is a thing that has really confused
[7:36] the people in our generation
[7:39] they have thought that you need to be a
[7:42] member of a religion in order to go to
[7:44] heaven
[7:50] Jesus did not begin any of this religion
[7:53] yes
[7:56] he's not the founder of the religion
[7:59] but Jesus when he came he came with one
[8:03] purpose
[8:12] sin is unbelief
[8:15] of the truth when God gives his wife
[8:19] and the people refuse to believe
[8:28] sin is not small
[8:30] attributes
[8:34] when you refuse to believe what God says
[8:37] in his words
[8:44] because of the things you did yeah
[8:48] because of what you refuse to believe
[8:53] why we are not going to heaven
[8:56] like the works we do already the Bible
[8:59] says the works of the righteousness
[9:10] I am not going to make it because of my
[9:14] works of righteousness
[9:20] [Music]
[10:17] it's not a building
[10:52] [Music]
[11:16] was asking the disciples
[11:20] for them to tell him what the people
[11:23] think that he is
[11:26] a child now please understand that Jesus
[11:29] was flesh and blood again and yes
[11:32] just like me standing before you today
[11:36] he was born by somebody yes
[11:39] they even knew their mother
[11:41] and he was just like them and here he
[11:45] was asking them who do people say I am
[11:50] now remember that there are three
[11:53] officers one more office is that of
[11:55] sonship in someone that God has decided
[11:59] to reveal himself in cartoon
[12:02] who is God
[12:04] in the Book of John chapter 4
[12:07] verse 24. it says God is a spirit
[12:13] brother if you can put up the scripture
[12:15] for the people God is a spirit
[12:18] so God is not flesh America
[12:22] [Music]
[13:29] foreign God so God is the same way
[13:33] God is a spirit you can't count God
[13:37] you cannot see his beginning
[13:43] unquenchable spirit
[13:45] [Music]
[14:01] and that is
[14:48] through throughout the generations
[15:00] the Bible even says we are born in sin
[15:04] even if your mother and father we are
[15:07] married in church
[15:11] we are all borns
[15:13] we are born
[15:16] as the Bible say we are born
[15:19] in in in sin
[15:24] we were shaped in the rooms
[15:43] we were born the way we were not
[15:46] supposed to be born
[15:49] children of God
[15:51] born the way we are born physically
[15:53] speaking
[15:56] who is God God is the spirit God is the
[16:01] world God is going to give birth to any
[16:04] son
[16:06] that son must be a wild child
[16:11] not a flesh child secretary
[16:16] that is why all of us
[16:19] no matter what our title is
