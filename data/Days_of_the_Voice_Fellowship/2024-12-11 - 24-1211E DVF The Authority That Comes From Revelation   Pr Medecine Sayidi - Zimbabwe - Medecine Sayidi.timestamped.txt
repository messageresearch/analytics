[35:26] Christ amen
[35:28] those who have been able to make it for
[35:30] for the for this weekday
[35:35] service I know there are more here
[35:37] online than is
[35:41] here uh but we are so grateful to see uh
[35:44] Brothers also who have joined us from
[35:46] different
[35:50] fellowships
[35:52] amen we we appreciate the
[35:56] fellowship um
[35:58] today is a blessed day for
[36:02] us uh initially we did not know that our
[36:07] visitors will be with us
[36:11] today uh I had thought that we shall
[36:14] just be traveling actually today morning
[36:16] to
[36:20] PA
[36:21] but pastor Pastor Nur just told me a few
[36:26] days ago he told me that no the arrival
[36:28] is on
[36:33] Friday so uh that means we shall be
[36:36] traveling very early in the morning
[36:39] tomorrow for the meetings in
[36:43] paa um it's a big meeting I was told
[36:46] about 2,000 people or
[36:50] more we coate your
[36:53] prayers uh that the Lord will you know
[36:55] move people coming from Sudan
[37:00] and all over
[37:01] West so we trust that the Lord will just
[37:04] help
[37:06] us amen so when I knew that the arrival
[37:10] is is
[37:13] Friday I told Pastor medicine so we are
[37:16] also going to Ina we are going to get a
[37:24] do before before we go but the enemy has
[37:28] not been
[37:29] happy Pastor s arrived um
[37:36] yesterday initially you know he he
[37:39] realized he had an 8 hour
[37:49] layover that that time he was supposed
[37:51] to be with the Believers in
[37:55] Addis but uh something happened and you
[37:59] know they told him at the airport um you
[38:01] know 8 hours is very little for you to
[38:03] get a visa to you know
[38:09] enter so he stayed at the airport for
[38:12] eight
[38:15] hours so it was like a big
[38:19] punishment and uh then after 8 hours of
[38:23] waiting he took the connecting flight to
[38:28] so when he arrived
[38:30] at he couldn't find his
[38:34] luggage you know where all his clothes
[38:38] are and all the other
[38:41] things so I mean I waited for him almost
[38:44] two
[38:46] hours until I asked him what is
[38:48] happening in
[38:49] there and he said well I can't find my
[38:53] BS so that's another frustration again
[38:59] so from from where he we left the
[39:02] airport without
[39:05] it so I told him that we have a service
[39:07] this
[39:10] evening and U brother our brother Ken
[39:13] also arrived today from
[39:17] Nairobi and and so brother brother
[39:19] brother Ken and I were talking with
[39:21] Pastor
[39:24] side and we agreed with him I don't know
[39:26] how brother k put
[39:29] it but in his own words it was there's a
[39:31] way he put it that uh you know he would
[39:34] use my suits
[39:41] today it sounds like a joke but the
[39:43] reality is he did not know whether he
[39:45] would get his clothes for this evening
[39:53] service until just a few minutes ago
[39:58] so I called in at the airport several
[40:02] times until the lady then says oh it has
[40:08] arrived
[40:10] amen picking it was another
[40:14] hustle I I I called brother
[40:18] sham and I told him just h a fly you
[40:22] have get in there because he was
[40:25] in get in there and pick
[40:28] and so he tried his
[40:30] best took about an hour or
[40:33] so and then more than an hour to drive
[40:37] here what I'm trying to say the devil
[40:40] has hindered the man of God to speak to
[40:42] us
[40:44] today but he did not
[40:46] Prevail amen and that certainly
[40:50] means God has
[40:53] something as we were driving home
[40:57] from the airport with Pastor
[40:59] side this part I had not told
[41:02] you um you know we found I don't know
[41:05] what happened yesterday just some
[41:07] terrific
[41:11] traffic we spent almost more than two
[41:14] hours I
[41:17] think it was very
[41:20] terrific so um but the Lord has been
[41:25] gracious I always say when the when the
[41:27] devil fights something so
[41:31] much that means that God is going to do
[41:36] something so I want you to be under
[41:39] great
[41:41] expectation these men have sacrificed a
[41:43] lot to be with us
[41:46] today um I always say you know feel like
[41:48] we're not worthy
[41:51] even we are so thankful that we can be
[41:55] here that you can be here and even those
[41:59] streaming
[42:00] online I just pray that the Lord will
[42:03] speak to
[42:04] you so Pastor side brother K and
[42:07] I we will be taking meetings in paa this
[42:12] weekend Pastor n invited us for a
[42:14] convention
[42:17] there remember us in
[42:19] prayers just remember us in prayers I
[42:22] would like to invite Pastor side but
[42:23] before we do that
[42:27] let me invite brother
[42:29] Ken to come and greet
[42:31] you
[42:33] [Applause]
[42:37] amen uh God bless you
[42:40] church I greet you all in the name of
[42:42] our Lord Jesus
[42:44] Christ God bless
[42:47] you are you happy to be in the house
[42:50] of I'm happy to be here
[42:53] tonight and I believe you're under great
[42:55] expectation
[42:57] I don't know if you're chared up like I
[43:00] am but I know something is going to
[43:04] happen and I want to come out of this
[43:06] place with the
[43:08] testimony that something has happened to
[43:11] me I want to personalize this
[43:14] testimony as we turn to our Bibles very
[43:17] quickly in the book of Second
[43:20] Kings and know I just have about five
[43:22] minutes to greet
[43:23] you and I couldn't think of any other
[43:26] better way to
[43:28] greet the saints of
[43:30] God rather than encouraging them with
[43:32] the word of
[43:35] God in the book of second Kings chapter
[43:38] 4 now there cried a certain woman of the
[43:41] wives of the sons of the prophets unto
[43:43] Elisha saying thy servant my husband is
[43:46] dead and thou knowest that thy servant
[43:49] did fear the lord and the Creditor has
[43:51] come to take unto him my two sons to be
[43:54] bondman and Elisha said unto
[43:57] what shall I do for thee tell me what
[44:00] hast thou in the house
[44:17] [Music]
[44:35] what hast thou in the
[44:37] house and I want to POS the same
[44:39] question to you
[44:41] tonight what thou in the
[44:44] house now I know some of you if I ask

[1:02:03] that just little
[1:02:06] exaltation it's a
[1:02:08] confirmation of the things I wanted to
[1:02:12] say and I knew he is
[1:02:15] here God bless you brother
[1:02:20] Ken so from the portion of scripture
[1:02:23] that he read
[1:02:26] amen there was something I wanted to
[1:02:29] preach just reading the same
[1:02:32] scripture amen but something said not
[1:02:37] tonight amen and I wondered
[1:02:41] why amen and just 15 minutes before I
[1:02:45] came you know that thing came down and
[1:02:48] said this is
[1:02:50] it whatever if I don't preach on
[1:02:54] something God raise
[1:02:57] somebody to say it
[1:02:59] anyhow you ra somebody else to say it
[1:03:04] any and there's no vain
[1:03:10] reputation amen there's no vain
[1:03:15] reputation amen let's open our Bibles to
[1:03:18] the Book of Mark chapter
[1:03:22] one we are going to read one verse there
[1:03:27] Mark chapter 1 we're going to read uh
[1:03:31] verse
[1:03:39] 22 the Bible
[1:03:41] says and they were astonished at his
[1:03:50] Doctrine for he taught them as one that
[1:03:53] had Authority
[1:03:59] not as the
[1:04:01] [Music]
[1:04:02] scribes may God add blessings to the
[1:04:04] reading of his
[1:04:07] word shall we pray dear heavly father we
[1:04:11] have open your
[1:04:13] word read it oh
[1:04:16] God May the same spirit that wrote this
[1:04:20] scripture come down tonight
[1:04:22] Lord anoint our faith
[1:04:26] may it bring the power of
[1:04:29] transformation may you hide me that I
[1:04:32] may not be seen and speak Spirits F
[1:04:35] spoken
[1:04:37] words I pray tonight that we may not
[1:04:40] only be hearers of the
[1:04:42] word but that we be the doers of the
[1:04:45] word thank you we bless your
[1:04:48] name everything into your
[1:04:51] hands Jesus name we
[1:04:53] pray amen amen amen richly bless you you
[1:04:58] may from the portion of the scripture
[1:05:00] that we have
[1:05:01] read the Bible
[1:05:03] says Jesus Christ when he went
[1:05:06] there and he was preaching in
[1:05:10] K the Bible says as he was
[1:05:14] preaching they were
[1:05:16] astonished at his
[1:05:19] Doctrine he says he
[1:05:21] taught as the one that had Authority
[1:05:26] not as the
[1:05:28] Scribe this is the
[1:05:30] difference between Jesus
[1:05:33] Christ and the
[1:05:35] scribes when the scribes are
[1:05:38] teaching it's just
[1:05:42] intellectual it's just Creeds and
[1:05:45] do but when Christ is
[1:05:48] teaching there is
[1:05:51] Authority there's some
[1:05:53] power there is a command
[1:05:56] Hallelujah the words that I speak unto
[1:05:59] you they are
[1:06:02] spirit and they are life so when he's
[1:06:06] speaking Hallelujah he's speaking with
[1:06:10] authority at one point in time they
[1:06:14] wonder what manner of men is this that
[1:06:17] even the
[1:06:18] winds obay his he can come in angry W he
[1:06:24] can speak to the TR daers he can say
[1:06:28] peace be still creation will obey him
[1:06:33] what manner of man is because he spoke
[1:06:36] with
[1:06:37] authority and I believe tonight the same
[1:06:41] power all that God
[1:06:44] was was P into Jesus Christ and all that
[1:06:48] Christ was was ped into us so tonight
[1:06:53] when we are here we are going to speak
[1:06:57] not as the scribes we are going to speak
[1:07:02] with
[1:07:03] authority let me tell you tonight this
[1:07:07] mountain shall be
[1:07:09] moved not by Mighty not by power but by
[1:07:14] my spirit says the Lord hallelujah we
[1:07:19] are not describing a mountain of problem
[1:07:23] Hallelujah he was looking Mount
[1:07:26] Hallelujah the Mount of Olives he was
[1:07:29] overlooking it and he says if you say to
[1:07:33] This Not That Mountain ah this he was
[1:07:36] looking over and say if you say to this
[1:07:40] mountain moved and be thou cast into the
[1:07:44] sea the Sea of Galilee was by the sight
[1:07:47] you would say if you can say to this
[1:07:50] mountain be thou moved and be cast into
[1:07:52] the sea
[1:07:55] not a mountain of
[1:07:58] problem but a physical Mountain do you
[1:08:02] believe that
[1:08:03] tonight when he said it he spoke with
[1:08:07] with
[1:08:08] authority and if you say it
[1:08:11] tonight from the depth of your heart if
[1:08:14] you speak with
[1:08:15] authority it's going to happen I've got
[1:08:19] good news for you tonight you are going
[1:08:22] to
[1:08:23] speak with authority
[1:08:26] Jesus taught with
[1:08:30] authority thank you Jesus brother Bram
[1:08:33] says in a message
[1:08:36] presuming preed
[1:08:38] 1962 on the 8th of March of paragraph 21
[1:08:43] he says now I'm going to teach you on
[1:08:45] the subject
[1:08:48] presuming the Webster says to presume is
[1:08:51] to
[1:08:53] venture without Authority
[1:08:57] to take it for
[1:08:58] granted that's the word
[1:09:02] presume without
[1:09:05] Authority just taking it for
[1:09:07] granted now there's so many people that
[1:09:10] does that they take it for
[1:09:13] granted that's all right it's all right
[1:09:16] to do just take it for
[1:09:19] granted that's to
[1:09:21] presume now
[1:09:23] Israel made a mistake
[1:09:26] when they did this not only Israel but
[1:09:32] everybody that does it it will be a
[1:09:35] fatal
[1:09:36] mistake when you
[1:09:39] presume to walk with God when God has
[1:09:42] not called you to with him when you
[1:09:47] presume to venture
[1:09:49] upon that's not scriptural think it will
[1:09:53] be all right
[1:09:55] not all
[1:09:56] right Hallelujah so tonight don't
[1:10:00] presume don't walk without
[1:10:03] Authority don't take things for
[1:10:06] granted your Gathering is not in
[1:10:10] vain God called you to
[1:10:13] church and when he called you to church
[1:10:16] don't take it for
[1:10:18] granted it's an
[1:10:20] authority that God has given
[1:10:23] you and don't take me for GR granted I'm
[1:10:26] not here on my own I'm an ambassador I'm
[1:10:31] on a mission God sent me down here I'm
[1:10:36] not here to play I'm here to make
[1:10:40] declarations the captives will go free
[1:10:43] the captives will go free the blind will
[1:10:46] see the sick will be heal those without
[1:10:50] the Holy Ghost will receive it I'm not
[1:10:54] presuming
[1:10:55] I know why I'm here I know what God gave
[1:10:58] me and I know what I'm doing Hallelujah
[1:11:03] I know what I'm doing and I know God
[1:11:06] will his word hallelujah I'm not
[1:11:10] presuming I'm not guessing Hallelujah if
[1:11:14] you are in a wheelchair at the end of
[1:11:17] the service to walk out
[1:11:21] [Applause]
[1:11:25] Hallelujah hallu you're going to walk
[1:11:27] out of
[1:11:29] that that headache will leave you
[1:11:34] now that
[1:11:37] fibroid that female
[1:11:39] trouble before you if you know it has
[1:11:43] left you
[1:11:45] now I'm not
[1:11:47] presuming I'm speaking with
[1:11:51] authority hallelujah hallelujah
[1:11:54] hallelujah hallelujah it's a FAL
[1:11:56] mistake to come to
[1:11:59] church
[1:12:05] presuming
[1:12:07] amen what time did the song service
[1:12:12] start
[1:12:14] no song service does not start when the
[1:12:17] song leader is on
[1:12:21] the Serv before the song
[1:12:27] because you come with

[2:57:04] offering
[2:57:06] shortly but before I just have two
[2:57:09] announcements uh one those of you who
[2:57:12] are here and maybe those also from
[2:57:14] different
[2:57:16] fellowships I know there many also been
[2:57:19] streaming and you have not yet
[2:57:22] registered please
[2:57:24] register for the Youth meetings in
[2:57:28] janary you know registration is very
[2:57:31] important because it gives an estimate
[2:57:34] to the people arranging to us who are
[2:57:35] arranging the
[2:57:40] meeting I was talking with Pastor side
[2:57:42] and he was giving me report of the youth
[2:57:44] convention which just concluded
[2:57:49] they were expecting is it 2,500
[2:57:52] something like
[2:57:55] that convention
[2:57:58] in and they received 4,500
[2:58:03] people so you can imagine you have to
[2:58:06] accommodate them you have to feed them
[2:58:09] and you've not been expecting
[2:58:11] them so it's really
[2:58:15] Unbecoming when we can encourage when we
[2:58:17] can encourage our young
[2:58:19] people and ourselves as well to just
[2:58:25] register it helps us if you can
[2:58:29] register then we know how many to
[2:58:33] expect and also we know how to plan for
[2:58:37] it and also our youth camp has been
[2:58:41] fought a lot this
[2:58:43] year we've had several venues canceled
[2:58:46] on the last last minute
[2:58:51] and our current venue has been
[2:58:54] lanzi
[2:58:58] insute and uh about a week ago we
[2:59:02] received news we can they cannot hold
[2:59:03] our
[2:59:08] convention but as our pastor was
[2:59:11] preaching I tapped into that to receive
[2:59:13] our own place for the meeting I believe
[2:59:15] the Lord will do it
[2:59:19] me I received it I don't care how long
[2:59:20] it takes I believe God will do
[2:59:24] it but um this is a little premature but
[2:59:27] because I know there are others
[2:59:28] streaming and those of you from other
[2:59:29] churches I thought it is appropriate to
[2:59:31] let you
[2:59:35] know um we will confirm it in in the
[2:59:39] next week I
[2:59:42] believe uh we might be holding our
[2:59:46] meetings at U Cham
[2:59:51] University and also we will be having
[2:59:53] accommodations around chambo
[2:59:58] College we shall make announcements on
[3:00:01] on that
[3:00:03] change next week so but just pray for us
[3:00:08] that the will of God will
[3:00:11] stand and also help us and
[3:00:14] register so it can help us in the
[3:00:16] preparation
