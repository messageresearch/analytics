each of our hearts father you know our heart is desire Grant it I pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you I have a we have a vis sister Winnie from Bala uh God bless you thank you for coming to be with us today we appreciate you so very much amen so we are going to the word in the book of Exodus if you could please turn to Exodus chapter 1 God bless you musicians uh everyone with your Bible please turn to the Book of Exodus chapter 1 we are reading from verses 15 if you there Say Amen you there amen so we are reading from verses 15 to vers 22 and the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives of which the name of the one was s cifra and the name of the other Po and he said when ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women and see them upon the stools if be a son then he shall kill him but if it be a daughter then she shall live but the midwives feared God and did not did not as the king of Egypt commanded them but saved the men children alive and the king of Egypt called for The Midwives and said unto them why have you done this thing and have saved the man children alive and the Midwife said unto Pharaoh because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women for they are Lively and are delivered before the midwives come in unto them I believe the Believers if you have receed if you you born again and you are a Believer and you a sister when it comes to delivery as much as it will not be easy just like it is not easy for everybody to deliver but God God usually gives Grace the Bible says in the book of First Timothy that he will give he will save them in childbearing or in child birth so women who are believers have that as a promise so sisters who are here you can say Amen to that you have that as a promise to deliver in child birth without complications it's your promise all right so then he says and therefore God dealt dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied and works very Mighty I want to read that verse once again and it came to pass because the midwives feared God that he made them houses okay I wanted to read verse 20 again therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied therefore God dealt well with the midwives and the people multiplied why did the people multiply because the main children were kept alive amen all right and uh the and um and and works very Mighty so the people multiplied and worked very Mighty so if the men children can be kept alive the people must multiply the people of that race must multiply the people of that seed must multiply each of you Brothers you have a seed and I'm glad that this is not being interpreted tonight because I can follow my thought trajectory very well and and you two can follow me each of you has a seed within you a generation after you and you see if the devil gets you if the devil finishes if the devil accomplishes his purpose in your life then there is going to be a destruction and there will be no multiplication but there is going to be multiplication if you are kept alive can you say Amen to that brothers and then he says and it came to pass because the midwives feared God that that that he made them houses and pharaoh charged all his people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save alive blessed be the name of the Lord God bless you you may be seated excuse me I've been speaking quite a lot in the meeting there so I need a little break praise the name of the Lord Lord now we I'm speaking today on the subject the power of the Next Generation and I'm going to request all the brothers to come and and and sit occupy all these front seats here so I can be able to see you directly I don't want to look this side this side and that side so all of you that side I'm requesting you to come on this other left side we have many chairs by this side and brother Marvin I don't know whether I want you there I don't know it's okay if you want to put for us some scriptures it's all right all right are you a sister please come over right here right in the front here there's a seat for you okay so and uh brother Enoch we don't have a lot of people coming in today so you might as well want to come and occupy all the brothers there deacons please help me I don't know which Deacon is on duty today please help me bring all the brothers this side praise the Lord brother Peter why don't you take your brother next to you and you come and occupy the the front seats yes I will appreciate that so very much thank you thank you thank you for cooperating okay I don't know why these days people fear front seats somehow people fear front seats don't you feel comfortable there on the front seat praise the name of the Lord so I'm speaking on the power of the Next Generation the power of the Next Generation friends there is this thing that is burning within me about the generation my generation Our Generation your generation no doubt we have had fathers and as I said before sisters that are part of this service today you are going to allow me to dedicate this service to the brothers is that amen yes so if you have children and they are uh Sons or if you have uh uh Brothers then this is for them you might want to send it to them but I want to say uh to you today that I have an immense burden on my heart about my generation because there there's a lot of things that I've been seeing around wherever I travel and even around in the fellowship here and even the people that I'm in contact with especially the the younger generation when I say the younger generation of course that is according to me because uh you will also say the younger generation so you know there is a generation that is younger than you so but I mean the generation of our time of course we are now in the 21st is it the 21st century so we we is it the one that is called Generation Z I'm not quite sure about that but I think there is this last generation the computer generation the WhatsApp generation uh the the phone smartphone generation that's the generation that we are living in of course I'm talking about you that is listening to me today so the internet generation the generation of the now and we see that there have been many whatever we are today that is positive has been partly because of the generations that have been there before us and whatever that we are that is negative has also been actually because of the generations that have been there before us you'll find that in each of us our individual lives that trials and things that we struggle with sometimes things that you struggle with and you have you have actually no solution for those things is partly because you may not know you may not even have known before but if you had a glimpse if God allowed you to have a glimpse on the generation before you maybe the generation of your father and you started the life of your father properly you will realize that many of the things that were passed down to you that maybe you do not want or things it might be a character it might be uh a lifestyle it might be things you know different things if you knew or had a chance to study your father you might realize that some of those things actually were passed down on to you and even the positive things as well you realize it was passed down onto you so there is a great power within a gen within you because now you are also going to influence the generation after you the generation that is coming after of course that is if the Lord terries we know that the Lord will is coming soon we believe that the Lord is coming on our generation but there is also a likelihood that he will he will T we do not know we are told to live as though he is coming today but to work as though he is coming tomorrow so you're not going to fold your hand and say I not do anything because the Lord is coming to tomorrow rather today because he's coming today I'm not going to work because he's coming today I'm not going to uh uh to plan for tomorrow because he coming today many people who believed and receiv received this message in the in the in the first years they did not actually work uh the pastors did not encourage their people to even contribute money for buying land and for building churches uh because they they were believing the Rapture was happening the next minute and that was true and still true today but it's been more than 50 years since the messenger died and the Rapture has not yet happened so there is a possibility that the Rapture may not actually happen for the next 50 years but also there is a possibility that it might actually happen in the next moments from now so we do not know we want to Hoy our potatoes we want to plant trees we want to believe for big things but we also want to live as though the Lord was coming the next moment is that amen so but now we notice that there is power in there is the the power of the next generation is here with you with me the power of the generation that is coming next many people live in uh I've had somebody use the word Babble but I want to use that word in this sense that many people live in a bab believing that they they uh that life is is so so easy and that uh you know they have nothing to worry about and that life is just going around about them and U you know they just appeared and then they just disappear and that life will continue on and life will continue on another generation shall come and another generation shall go but I want to be one person who is going to believe that I'm not here just to leave and disappear I never appeared and I will not disappear I came from somewhere and I'm going somewhere when Jesus was on Earth he lived what I call a life of purpose because Jesus believed that the life he was living the life he had the life that he came down on Earth to live he was actually living that life for not himself but for the Next Generation which was coming after him and actually we are beneficiaries of the life that Jesus Christ lived if it wasn't for him then we would not have a life but you see the power of the next generation is also now with you whatever went wrong before you doesn't really count now it is what is going to go wrong wrong with you now there is something you can stop or there is something you can permit and give permission to pass you and go to another generation the power of the next generation is with you that's what I'm sharing with you tonight and we see here that the devil knows that the only way he can destroy the next generation is by killing Sons not daughters Sons I want you to notice that the devil knows that very well the power of the next generation is with sons not with daughters but with sons the reason for that is seed is in and with the sun it is a male child that moves the seed from one generation to another to another to another here in Africa for centuries uh parents did not use to allow their uh girl children to inherit their property because it was going to disappear it was you know it it had to be inherited by the by the male children because it is with them that seed was transferred from the generation of their father to another generation and so I want you to see brother bam here says in the message the resurrection of Lazarus it says it is just like the blood the bloodstream comes from the male sex we know know that the mother is just an incubator for the child and the mother's blood now some of you may not actually know this so listen to this and the mother's blood has nothing to do with the child at all did you know that only the doctor Dr mul knew that he's a medical doctor by the way someone told me maybe he's a nurse no brother mul is a professional full medical doctor is that correct brother how many years did you study in University to become a doctor 5 years fulltime doctor right and he is telling us that it is true the mother's blood has nothing to do with the child at all although it is born in the blood and the person who said this actually he's a he's a seventh grader he only went up to seventh grade and he can tell you things that a medical doctor will tell you he was supernaturally sent to by God to our generation and he says although it is born in the blood of the mother but it has nothing to do with it it has got one drop of the mother's blood it sorry it hasn't got one drop of the mother's blood in it it's the blood of the father and the life lays in the blood so God in his Sovereign wisdom placed the seed listen God in his Sovereign wisdom placed the seed of multiplication in the man not in the woman but in the man you notice that a man um uh the the seed when when a child is in the womb of the mother all the blood within the stream of the child is actually the father's blood no Speck of a mother's blood in there imagine it imagine it but the father's blood I want you to imagine that and so I want to show you that God in his Sovereign wisdom he placed the seed of multiplication the seed that would multiply the um uh the human race in mankind or in man in the male gene or male seed if only the devil can destroy the man the devil knows if I can destroy the man then he surely can destroy the Next Generation he will actually unhate remove completely destroy all the other Generations that will come after so now it is in the man it is in the man is in the boy it is in The Man Child let me put it that way that the seed of multiplication has been placed and that's why the devil tries hard so hard to lock up the male's Destiny the devil let me tell you the devil tries hard to destroy the destiny of a male child some of you of course will tell and can tell that there are some families that you if you come from that family they know you can have as many children as you want and they will all leave but when you have a male child that child will die how many have heard of that I see a hand back there another hand who else has heard of that oh you're privileged to come from a family that doesn't experience that or you've not heard of that but I'll tell you it's all over I've heard of it many many times they will tell you for for us in our family we can have as many children as we want to have but when it comes to having male children they will either die in the stomach not yet born or they will actually not be born at all they they will they will they will be born dead or they will be born half dead you see because within the devil knows that you see that maybe of course it happens here in Africa because maybe because of Witchcraft and there is someone that did not want that that seed to multiply and then he would try to to place a cast on that family and then things happen that uh the male children will either not be born in other families other the girls can prosper but the boys cannot Prosper you see you know they will try all that they can but no prosperity for you as long as you are a male child you see whether it is witchcraft or what I want to tell you it is the devil okay it's the devil and the devil is targeting the M I'm going to show you here I'm going if you give me time and your attention I trust that this will be a blessing to you by the time we are done he says that is why the devil tries hard to lock up the male's Destiny and how does he lock it up he locks It Up by burying it in Toms several Toms the devil has laid or dug Toms Toms of uh several things that he will try to and I'll show it to you and once I show it to you you will see clearly that that's the truth he will try to uh bury them in the TBS of immoral living that's one of the devices the devil used es he will he will take he will take the boys and the the the gentleman or the the the men he will bury them in the terms of immoral living and others he will take them and he will bury them in the terbs of drug abuse they are very yes I know they are prostitutes women prostitutes but when you if you want to count how many more people live in uh immoral living it's actually men more than women most women do not live immorally but men do men do and the devil wants to bury them there and and even when they married you'll find they still live in immoral actions because the devil wants to bury them in there and and uh very few women will be in drug abuse but the devil will Target men the devil wants men to abuse drugs so they can lose their mind so they can become mad so they can become crazy so that their mind will not function the way it is supposed to function and when he does that he has captivated them and he will keep them there and when I was leaving in Ethiopia at the time during the reign of Mel zwi who was um the prime minister of Ethiopia before two others he the people were saying because you see how many not chat chat chat chat yes yes AAA what is it called cut it's called cut okay now uh you see that is um is it weed it's not weed it it's called Kaka here so my I don't know what it is exactly but U you see that thing you know when you take it it the first thing it takes away from you is time because you really need a lot of time because you will need to chew it and you chew it like a go cuz you see you chew it and then you continue chewing and then you'll get gum and you continue chewing so you see at that time during that time there were many young people chew I don't know whether they chew it now in EOP like they used to chew it then but they were chewing it everywhere and it was legalized so it can be sold anywhere so everybody was just buying and chewing but you will find not girls or women but boys and men every corner you'll find them chewing chewing chewing putting G and chewing putting that is it leaves chewing chewing chewing chewing so you find their mouth you know like goats you know like when a goat is eating they are chewing they're chewing and uh then many times of course you find uh you know they are uh you know they're reading they're chewing they're driving they're chewing even drivers taxi drivers I'm not talking about the big taxi I'm talking about the contract taxi so imagine you contract a taxi we call it special here oh Uber and someone is chewing cat see chewing chewing chewing chewing Che until I ask somebody isn't this thing legal in this country said no anybody can chew so I asked one brother he said why is this thing legalized he said well if you you give the young people that thing they will be so busy that they will have no time for politics so the man was not troubled for over 30 years because the young people were chewing everybody was busy chewing and the other thing that that was also legalized is alcohol it is that I found young men smoking young men are taking alcohol young young as young as 14 16 they smoking and they they're drinking alcohol you know and the devil will legalize those things because H and even now in the world agenda they're trying to push for those things they're trying to push it to legalize it say it's okay to take weed it's okay to smoke it's okay let everybody have their rights and why because the devil is targeting the Next Generation imagine what kind of generation we are going to have after this one because this let me tell you our generation is the last s generation if the Lord carries the last s generation the next generation is going to go Bak is going to be a generation of Fools and only the generation that will come out of the people that fear the name of the Lord people that have amen kept themselves and they have realized The Power Within them and they have not allowed the devil to control them will be the only that generation will be the only generation that will fear will fear God and serve God I tell you what in Europe as I'm speaking to you now in Europe Christianity came of course from Israel and then all onto Europe and from Europe to Africa but now in Europe most of the churches are being sold of because you see there are no longer people there are many Church buildings in Europe that are free that are empty nobody's attending them nobody's attending church anymore and this is where they were very religious and attending Mass attending church you know doing baptisms doing many of these things as we know as we see them do it now in the big Cathedrals they have those big Cathedrals very many of them across Europe of course Europe is is large I'm talking about uh England I'm talking about Wales I'm talking about France I'm talking about all those places and you find that right now those places which used to be Church holy places as it were you find them right now they're putting uh discs the people buy it off and they sell it off and they put disects they put um you know G things people just go there to uh worship the devil literally you know in the places of worship Christianity Europe is no longer a Christian place people are being arrested even they if they find you preaching on the road they will arrest you because you see the generation that they have now is that generation which does not fear God at all which has taken God out of their minds if you read in the Book of Romans chapter 1 the Bible says they've become reprobates in their mind you know let me because they did not retain God I did not plan to read that but let me read that little portion there if you can open with me the book of Romans there something I want you to see there I realized I picked my wife's Bible and so it's not easy for me to open quicker quickly so here in the in Romans chapter 1 vers um it says for the wrath of God is vers 18 for the wrath of God is revealed against all un ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth in unrighteousness because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God has showed it unto them for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse because that they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful but became vain they became vain in their own imaginations and their foolish Hearts was darkened professing themselves to be wise they be fools and they Chang the glory of the uncorruptible god into an image made like to corruptible man and to birds and to four-footed beasts and creeping things so and and um and where because of that because of what they did what did God do God gave also to God gave them up to uncleanliness through the lust of their own Hearts to dishonor their own bodies between themselves and you will find that right now in in in Europe many will say oh no we are some of them are saying we are birds others saying we are sheep others they're saying we are this we are that imagine a human being in the morning saying I'm a dog and defend my rights I'm a dog a human being a full I'm not dreaming I'm telling you things that are happening some of you know it some of you don't know but I'm telling you this is happening in a a place where it used to be a Christian Nation is no longer a Christian Nation and let me tell you this was prophesied that it had to happen the cup of iniquity has to be full for the wrath of God to come down to the Earth do not think that God is just going to come and destroy the Earth just like that no the wrath of God the wrath of God must be full and when will it be full when the the cup of iniquity has filled up and the cup of iniquity of God is filling up and filling up quickly you find them they have legalized many things they've legalized many things that used to be seen they've legalized and it's coming down here here of course it will come down here it will go all over the world it's not going to be a European problem or an American problem it's going to be a world problem until the cup of iniquity has filled up and then the wrath of God will come down and in Europe in Asia and in America there are believers I uh met a few of course I was there and um I remember when I was in Germany I I I noticed there are very few people that get saved very few people here if if we took it upon ourselves and said in one month we are going to have 500 people believe this message it is possible how many agree with me it is possible right cuz I mean how many people brother Dixon how many people can you get to believe the message in one month okay in one day if you if it's your job you say I'm going to do it I'm going to witness about Jesus Christ how many people can you get 10 10 in one day multiply that by 30 how many is that that 300 you are one man all right how about each of us if we are 50 how many will that be in one month in Europe even if you make it your job and you doing nothing you're just eating sleeping and preaching even one person is difficult a month their mind is no longer on God anymore who are the people believing the children of former Believers the children of former Believers you'll find that there was a family that loved God so much to train their children so much raiseed them in the fear of God and and that seed was passed on to the next Generation to another generation to another generation and until now even when they backslide those are the ones that will come back and get saved because they they the the other generation before them had the power to raise the Next Generation after after them do you want to raise a generation of people that fear God then it begins with you you are the power but the devil is so against that right now it is seed sowing time and the devil is going to stop at nothing that's why let me tell you that's why he's fighting you so much he's not fighting he's fighting the girls and the boy the girls and the mothers too but I'm telling that's why he's putting all his guns and all his strength on The Man Child on the males on the brothers on you why because he knows he can only be destroyed if you don't get destroyed but let me tell you praise the name of the Lord if you don't get destroyed you can destroy the Devil and the works and the devices of the devil but if he gets you then he has got he has already got your your generation after you it's a burden I I I promise you an hour and a half I trust that it will be sufficient listen there's a cobweb you know the devil is burying them in a cobweb of of Deceit spirits and demons of Deceit Idol idol you know short business not business but busyness people become so busy doing a lot of nothing imagine someone being so busy but accomplishing a lot of nothing people don't know anymore what to live for I've been speaking to people and they say Pastor what is it to live a life of purpose I mean you don't even know what to live to live a life of purpose and people would say Oh no you're taking life seriously oh friend if you don't take life seriously then the generation after you is doomed you have to take life seriously because it's not your life it's the life of the Next Generation after you you are sowing a seed the power dwells within you the power dwells within me the moment I understood that years ago and it's been made it's being made real to me as you know as better as the days go go by and I I noticed I had to live a life of purpose and I had to fight and fight continually you do not let the devil bring you down with whatever it is that brought down your father or brought down those before you you fight it until you defeat it because if you don't the next generation is going to get to be overcome now listen if the devil succeeds in that he kills your destiny he kills your purpose he kills your abilities in each of you in each of us we have abilities We There is a purpose language fails me to explain what is on my heart to you but listen there is a purpose that God had when he had you in his mind before the foundation of the world and that purpose is as different as your palm is as your thumb print is each of us has a different thumb print you notice your Thum print is not as even your brother it is different even your brother from your father it is different did you know that your Thum print is different that is why the same Abraham could have an Isaac and the same Abraham could have an ishma they have different Thum prints they from the same father different Thum prints and even from the same mother even from the same mother the one woman can give birth to both the seed of God and serpent seed did you know that it happened in history one woman gave birth to Jacob and one woman gave birth to to Esau same mother same father different th print different nature different character different life one was of God and one was of the serpent cu the Bible says that God loved Jacob and he hated Esau you see as much as the father loved Esau but God hated Esau so Esau was not of of God but the seed of of of Jacob was different now if Jacob said I'm going to live like my brother because this is my family I I'm born here and and and if my brother is this way and my father even loves him I'm going to be this way oh friend you've lost your way you have to find God yourself even if your family disagrees with you even if everybody in your clan disagrees with you you have a purpose that you must fight you must find and you must fight for it we know of Jacob when Jacob found that he found he met the angel of the Lord and he said I'm not leaving with I'm not leaving you until you bless me I'm not going to leave you until you bless me the angel said let me go he said no I will not let you go until you bless me here is a man who had found purpose he had found Revelation let me tell you friends when you find the Revelation when you when when you find the revelation of the word and it is revealed to you who you are in Christ it is revealed to you that you are a child of God you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world Hallelujah you have found purpose that is purpose the moment you find that nobody may find it in your family but brother when you find it amen congratulation you found power pass that's the beginning to fight for it until you win it when Jacob found out he was not just a Jacob he realized he had to change his name had to change the way he was born was perverted and he had to be born again he realized he needed a new name he realized I mean it was open to him that he had to be changed he had to be blessed now we are talking about a man who who was already physically blessed okay he had too many goats and sheep and ox and he had a lot but he knew he attained all of it under the anointing of Jacob because Jacob was a thug he he was just a a Thief you know a santer so he he knew all that he knew he had too much but he had attained it all through the seit and and so he knew he had to have the true blessing of God he knew you to to attain a new and a true blessing of God and the bible say that the blessing of God maketh rich and he adds no sorrow upon it and you knew the blessing I want is not what the world gives like I have but I want the blessing that comes from God himself to me because that is the blessing he was going to pass on to another generation amen it's it's not the blessing of uh of Deceit and you know a blessing of uh mixing up things and it was going to be a blessing of God that comes from God and he said I'm not going to leave you until you bless me and when God blessed him of course it wasn't without hustle and fighting and that's why I always say we have to fight it out the Bible says we have to make our calling and election sure he also says that uh if we don't fight then we will not reign with you him you cannot be an overcomer without fighting if you're facing something you have to fight it and overcome it you know many of us are born with a lot of things that we we do we realized we did not know but we realized we did not need it's up to you to say well I Was Born This Way in all our family we are poor you remain poor forever no problem in all our family we are lustful men you will be lustful all your life and nothing will change that in all our family we marry at 40 you will marry at 40 after all all your family marries at 40 oh it's your physical family but you have no revelation of who you are say in all our family actually no man can keep a marriage we all divorce you will be divorced you know our after everybody divorces so why do I even care why do I even mind about marrying and that's why we have a generation that doesn't want to marry because of the things that happened in the past they keep saying this is this happened to my mother this happened to my father this happened to you know this happened and to my brother this happened so I'm not going to be a party of this and because of that I'm not going to get married or to is the devil that is showing you that but remember that is not your true lineage you have another lineage and that comes from the word it comes from your true identity when you realize when it is revealed to you who you are you realize I have another purpose the purpose I have is not to continue my father my biological father's lineage but I have a purpose of continuing my heavenly father's lineage and that purpose is true that purpose has no Cur that purpose has only Blessings Now that when you find that you have found purpose but when you lose that you've lost your way now there are three things that our Prophet told us that ministers should avoid and he in the message life story my life story he said here is three things that I've noticed in reading of other ministers if this ever gets a hold of a minister it got him and there is weak spot and there is a weak spot he says one money two women three popularity and he says that's right Dodge the very appearance of it now he says in other words in the only way way of overcoming this is dodging Shinning the very appearance of it now it may not be the thing but it appears like that avoid it and the first one he mentions is money then the second is women the third is popularity and we have many examples in the Bible of people that were defeated by that many people who had great purpose in their life but somehow that got a hold of them balam is one of the examples of people that were CAU and over taken by money now here is a man who was a gift of God uh who was gifted by God and uh he was a prophet but because somehow he he maybe from down in his lineage he had this desire they had this appetite for money you know you say like in our family we just love money we just want to be rich and uh you know I mean like the man wanted money wanted to be rich he knew it was wrong he went to go because Bal came to him he said I want you to go and cast me these people meaning curing Israel he knew it was wrong but he said okay let me go and ask God God should I if you ever pray such prayers you will grieve the heart of God if you know what God wants you to do do it without praying don't pray for the permissive will of God if you pray for the permissive will of God God will give it to you but it will ruin your life it will remove God's purpose in your life and we've seen it that's why we are the way we are that's why we are born the way we are born because we are all in the permissive will the perfect will in the perfect will we would never have to be sick we would never have to be weary we would never have to be poor we never have to be beggarly in the perfect will of God but you see we are this way because of the way we are born in the permissive will friends don't ask for the permissive ask for the perfect will of God in everything that you do and we find that this man went went ahead to say oh please go let me go cast them God said well well then if you want to cast them it's all right you can go and cast them initially God said don't so he came and he said I'm sorry I I will not cast them God has said I shouldn't cast them and so I will not cast them and Bal said H wait I'm going to give you a lot of money a lot of money and and and a lot of money we're talking about a lot of gold and silver and and change of garments and things he said ah I don't want to do it but the Temptation is so big how many have ever been tempted by money you don't want to do the thing but money you feel like you want to attain it let me tell you this is what one of the things that kills the generation money the Bible says that the love of money is the beginning of all evil and all men that have prospered in this life have not loved money but they have rather loved God more than money men of purpose I'm speaking of men of purpose praise God and so the man went back and prayed he said oh God let me go and do it and and and God said all right if you want to go and do it go and do it so God let him go to go and do it and uh and we know the story how it how it goes later on we find that uh he he goes on his is it a donkey on us but he goes on his donkey and and as they're going to go and cast Israel the angel of the Lord appears before the donkey and then the donkey runs away and this man who is blinded I want you to to see what money can do they say money talks right now money was talking it was no longer the man of God balam it was man talking man can talk until you become blind of the reality the reality of the purpose of God for your life and this man was so blinded by the reality of money that he did not see the angel he's a prophet an animal saw the angel but he did not see the angel because he was blinded by the love of money and so he he struck it and then it's listen listen this is the interesting part and then it spoke and he said why have you hit me my master have I ever done this have I ever disobey you have I he said but why didn't you hey he didn't even realize an animal spoke for the first time in history he was so blinded that he he did not understand an animal is not supposed to speak like that you will be so blind that you will not see what God is doing in your life because you're blinded with the love of money and and and balam I'm telling you balam went and he tried several times to curse he would open his mouth to I God would say no I bless he kept them blessing and blessing and blessing but I would say he lost his way because of the Love of Money friends do you think he was rewarded by God because of going against the will of God he he he was was all all along going against the purpose of God for his life he was gifted in a way that no man else was gifted at the time and season of his life but see he did not use his gift the way it was supposed to be used you have a gift within you you yourself you're a gift to the world the sooner you see it hallelujah oh my God reveal it to you you are a gift to the world you are born in such a way that no man was born like you no man has your thumb prit no man is like you quit being like somebody else or wanting to be like somebody else you are the only you that there is in the world and nobody else can take your place or no one can be like you and you cannot be like someone else and that's why even when you talk about Role Models wanting to be like that one wanting to be like this one wanting to be oh friend you must be like you because you are the only gift that God has placed here in the world that is like you there will be no other you if you die you you are dead and another one another one not like you but another one will come if you can't accomplish God's purpose for you somebody else not like you but somebody else that is not you will fulfill it praise God I don't know about you but as far as I'm concerned I want to accomplish God's purpose in my life here on Earth and then we find that there was another person called Samson and Samson was um was an anointed man another anointed man of God but you see for him it wasn't money for him it wasn't money M for him it was women now for him when it came to women H it touched his heart brother I wish you would stay close by Brother Patrick and and don't miss this because after all who knows this might be your weak point as well and then we find out that uh you see when it came to Samson Samson was trapped brother Samson was trapped Samson was a man that was born with strength naturally God spoke to his mother even before he was born did you know that God knew you before you were even born and the moment you were born the devil knew it was hell Hallelujah I had three daughters and it was all fine no issue but the day I was supposed to have a boy I saw the devil fighting like I've never seen before now while I was studying this I know why there is something about a a male child there is something about a son there is something about you brother because the devil hates you so much because he knows there are things that you can do to influence another generation that nobody else might be able to do no other creature can be able to do and see that Samson when my boy was born of course I told you the story how the devil came and he fought so much I mean I've never seen such manifestation of demons see saw them clearly in a vision at the same time very early in the morning when I woke up I out of the vision I uh smelt that uh sulfur-like kind of feeling demonic feeling and my wife I noticed she was also struggling in her sleep so when I woke her up and she told me the same same things I saw and heard demons are real just like God is real and the devil is against you in a way that you can never imagine because he knows if you grow to an to a moment of understanding why you are on earth he knows his plans for destroying many Souls has been destroyed and that's why the devil would try his best to keep you busy he will keep you busy with money or he will keep you busy with women or he will keep you busy wanting to be something you were never meant to be and you find that you find that when Samson was so infatuated in his mind because of a woman he told his parents he came to his place say father mother get me this woman I want her it wasn't about what his parents thought was good for him it wasn't about what the Bible or what rather God thought was good for him amen it wasn't about what even God thought about what was good for him it was about what he thought was good for him he knew and he felt like he wanted this Philistine woman to be his wife so he said I don't care about your religion I don't care about your beliefs that's all yours all I care about is get me this woman and this is how the devil has got and and trapped this generation you find that a good man a good goodly young man but you see he's they are trapped you know with women and L and you find them completely overtaken and brother bam says when to gets all of you it's got you and until you're born again and filled with the Holy Ghost you can't come out of it and and when it got Samson you see it really got him to to the moment to the extent that Samson reached a level of course even when when this woman betrayed him the first time the second time thir the man was blinded he did not say that this woman is not good for me he did not say that this is this is not a good thing for me to be in this kind of Hall Tre he didn't see it he was so blinded by by by the by the by the moment and by the desire he was having with this woman that he failed to see the purpose of God for his life oh may God open your eyes brother that you will not be blinded blinded so much that don't see the purpose of God for your life God had a purpose for Samson but the devil also had a purpose the devil wanted to Blind some Samson so that he would not see it is the woman only the woman that is standing between him and the purpose if only he had seen that and removed Delilah you don't know what he would have done with the Philistine Samson was a machine he was born to be a machine to destroy the enemies of Israel one man in the of God but because Samson was so blinded amen by the woman he failed to accomplish his purpose properly the woman took his life they took him imagine here is a man born under a sign a man born under prophecy a man God the angel of the Lord himself came down and and announced the birth of Samson but still Samson was blinded and because of this it reached a moment when he was Stripped Away of everything and it's a bad sight to look at the man was blind they removed his eyes they removed his eyes when the first thing the devil does when he traps you he removes your eyes they will tell you they will advise you they will cancel you but you will be like I don't see it that way I don't see that why because there is a demon on you there is a spirit on you that you need to break out of and let let me tell you what can help you to break out of that is the spirit of God and the word of God and that's why we preach this word amen with so with so much enthusiasm and strength and power why because this word has the power to break you out of that kind of spirit and and and and you find that when Samson was in that kind of blindness you know he didn't see anything he was now blind and the devil was only making him to make they called it spot for the Philistines imagine a man born to destroy the Philistines but now he's entertaining the Philistines did you know that any time you go and you're trapped by this Spirit of immorality you are actually entertaining the devil did you know that if you look at a woman to last after her you are entertaining the devil the moment you overtaken with a woman you entertaining the devil you see I'm not talking about the sstem I'm talking about the women in the world the spirit of lust and the spirit of adultery and fornication if you overtaken by that you are entertaining the devil the devil has not seen such a best sight as a Believer a sight of God born under a sign for a purpose entertaining him in immorality it's a very bad demon and spirit it will take away your spiritual sight that you will not be able to see the purpose of God for your life the only thing you can see is the darkness that the devil has laid before you you don't see you don't have any hope you have no faith you're just blinded to the reality and that's why I always tell the people that you see the spirit of fornication what it does is it brings a curse over you and that's why people who usually go into fornication you realize there there's a curse over you things that you can't even break out of things that happen in your life you knew things would go this way and then you find them going another way because there's a curse over your life there's a Darkness you can't remove and and you know it's it's confusion because the devil removes your eyes and he makes you to entertain him and then literally you find that this man became powerless a powerful man became a powerless man and when he stood before all these people right there the only thing that redeemed him or saved him was he returned back to God he remembered he said oh God give me this one more time this one more chance oh God let me die with my enemy I believe that if a child of God a true Son of God would come to that place whereby you realized you were wrong when God let me tell you when God real shows you his word the revelation of his word and you realize you are wrong and you see the light that's the best blessing you can ever receive and when you do brother die with your enemy you better die but with your enemy praise God hallelujah and the man never fulfilled all his purpose because of women Brothers this is something that the devil wants to destroy the this generation with so that he can destroy the power of the Next Generation and I find out another thing that brother bam talked about was popularity Saul sa by bam says that Saul was a prophet Saul was a Prince among them Saul was actually supposed to be a great man but he wanted to be great and he wanted to be Mighty to the extent that he wasted it all and God brought him down whatever wants to put itself up God will bring it down if you see someone fighting so hard to pass everybody and to be up by by hook crew by any means by every means I want to be on top brother you are on your way down God will make sure you are down if you want to be anything in life humble yourself it is in humility that you become strong it is in humility that God lifts you up it is in humility that God makes you something it is in humility that you realize your life's purpose but the moment you think that you want to be something and you you know you feel like that's how the devil was brought down by pride and wanting to be popular among the men and everybody and those three things Brethren and I I took the time for that because it's very important in the beginning the devil desired to impersonate now this is this is another G I want you to listen to this the devil desired to impersonate you did you know that the devil desire to impersonate the man thereby bypassing him and destroying his entire generation now God had intended for this man to multiply together with his wife a race a generation that will fear God and serve God but when the devil came he bypass this man and he came to bring his own seed he intended to be like this man and by doing that he destroyed his entire generation there is something that touched me here I want you to follow this quote here in the Ephesian Church Ed says this portion of scripture is the revelation of how the literal the literal seed of the serpent was swn in the Earth the literal seed not the spiritual but the literal the the literal seed of the serpent was swn in the Earth even as we have we have the account of Luke in Luke 1: 26-35 talking about Mary and um and and the angel Gabriel and how God brought down his seed even as we have that account wherein he set forth the exact account of how the seed of the woman came into the physical into physical manifestation apart from the instrumentality of the human male as the seed of the woman was literally God the seed of the woman was literally God reproducing himself in human flesh can you imagine that God himself oh my God reproducing himself in human flesh so the seed of the serpent is the literal way that Satan found he was able to open the door himself into the human race the Devil Himself he opened the door into the human race he himself wanted to enter into the human race and how did he do that by using the seed of the serpent listen it was impossible for Satan for he is only a created spiritual being so it was impossible for him to reproduce himself in the manner which God reproduced himself how did God reproduce himself anybody knows by the spoken word and Mary said be unto me according to your word and she became pregnant so the devil couldn't do that and because the devil couldn't use his word to create so what did he do so because he couldn't do that so the Genesis account in the Book of Genesis tells us how he produced his seed and introduced or injected himself into the human race also recall that Satan is called the serpent it is his seed or injection into the human race we are speaking of before Adam ever heard car knowledge of Eve now when I read this the first time I missed it when I read it the second time I missed it when I went back to this court and read it the third time I cot it because I wondered why the Holy Spirit was leading me to this court for this service I want you to get it listen before Adam ever had Canal knowledge of Eve the serpent had that knowledge ahead of him that's the portion I had missed twice and I hope we'll come back to e and you get it and that one born of it was can now do you remember when brother when Pastor Sunday came to this church and he spoke about illegitimate children someone born by illegitimate birth and he said that they never get saved and he said that uh it takes Grace God's grace which indeed by God's grace anybody can be saved but then I come to think of it I said this also applies today right now you find that you know the devil what did he do when when Eve was a virgin please don't miss this when Eve was a virgin she had not yet seen her husband for the first time that Serpent of course the devil Satan had incarnated in that serpent so that because of the instrumentality of that serpent so the serpent came to Eve and the serpent had Canon knowledge of Eve and that was the original sin before Adam her husband would do it with her and that was the problem that has caused all the human race problems and I want to tell you the same thing today the same thing today the devil is doing we know that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever right he he is the same forever but Satan is a spirit too if Satan was Satan yesterday he is Satan today until you be destroyed if Satan did something yesterday he will do the same thing today you only change tactics if in the beginning he used he used a beast and the prophet says a man without the Holy Ghost is like a beast the devil is using men today working on two feet and deceiving them to go on virgin girls girls that have never known men before and you find these men defiling those girls remember if it's not your wife it is someone else's wife and the moment you begin to get a hold of them brother bam tells us in the message about the um brother bam speaks of the the the the the uh the virtues of a woman that God has given to her he says virtues of sacred motherhood sacred Womanhood and and sacred virtue those virtues should never be mured those should never be defiled by a man before you find or a woman finds her husband God has placed those things on a woman what is it her body her body is sacred the woman's body is sacred her breasts are sacred her body her thighs are sacred her body her body all over her body is sacred it should never be defiled by a man that's what the devil did in the of aen he went and defiled Eve's body before Adam could do it the devil did it because he was Satan from the beginning and you find that he said also she has virtue for her to be virtue as a Virgin It should never be defiled imagine God sealed her sealed her for who for her husband and you find today Hollywood has turned it into a hogwash our society has turned a woman into brother bam used that word doesn't sound popular but it's the truth Hollywood and the devil has turned the woman into a sex garbage car you find a woman going from this man to another man to another man to another man to another man and these men are all possessed by demons just like the women are and and you find that you their conscious is seared the B say their conscious is seared with a hot iron that they will not see the reality of what they actually doing and I've said many times to the young people that you see sex is more more a spiritual thing than a physical thing actually more spiritual Than Physical see what happened because of what was done the Garden of Eden until today we are suffering the consequences of that now when a woman does that she suffers those consequences all her life and that seed which she be gets out of that it takes God's grace for them to be saved we find that the the seed that she conceived out of that was Cain Cain who actually never received salvation because Cain was saent seed Cain was of of born of begotten of the wicked one first John 3:12 it says the holy spirit in John could not in one place call Adam the wicked one for that is what we would be if we were fathered if he fathered Cain we would also be the wicked one if Adam was the father of Cain and in another place canot call Adam one place Wicked one and another call him a Son of God for which he was by creation for he was a Son of God by creation hallelujah hallelujah and we Brothers I want to tell you you are a son of God by creation that's why you should never be found to do the works of the flesh because the flesh is not a son of God but the Son of God is in your soul and if you have been once found in that kind of Life the Bible Apostle Paul says it should not even be now among the Believers having professed Christ and salvation it should not even be once named among you why because now you no longer live according to the flesh but now you live according to the spirit he says you see the things that are of old are all done what passed away and now behold all things are new why because you see it's no longer you that was there it's now another man in here leaving another purpose he says Cain turned out in character like his father a bringer of death a murderer you see oh praise God this is so real friends that's why we see a generation that doesn't fear to murder you see those kind of people that would sleep with people before they marry them so oh you're prant oh just what kind of spirit is that one telling the women to abort tell me what kind of spirit is a spirit of Cain the spirit of the serpent he said he was a murderer from the beginning he is a bringer of death not life but God is a bringer of life not death and that's why they would sleep with those women but they are not ready to bring life they are ready to bring death because they have a wrong Spirit on them you see he it was a matter from the beginning he's at a Defiance of God when first by the almighty in Genesis 4:5 9913 to4 show him to be absolutely unhuman like in characteristics seeming even to surpass any account we have in scripture concerning a confrontation of Satan by God you find that that even the governments of this world are now ruled by Satan himself the governments of this world are ruled by Satan that's why they will promote abortion they will promote everything that is a anti- good anti- word and therefore Antichrist because anything that is anti- word is is Antichrist can you imagine that they are promoting drugs they're promoting abortion they promoting you know homosexuality they're promoting you know all this kind of immorality why because the devil's purpose is to destroy The Man Child again he doesn't want a generation that will serve God can't you see friends the devil is out against us have you heard them have you heard some of their ch I heard it and I couldn't believe my my ears they said I don't even remember the words but uh they said we are something we are something we are after your children we are coming those kind of words the devil knows but the people are blinded they can't see these people are perverted it's not them it's the demon the spirit on them on the generation trying to come at what the sons the sons he wants to destroy them imagine a full man of full grown man the devil telling them you are a woman because he doesn't want this man to pass a seed onto another generation that will serve and fear God no none of them can serve God why because they know recently the pop said that I just read I don't know whether it is true is it true he said that now in the Catholic Church they can marry man and man woman and woman imagine something like that you think it's coming from God the pope just revealed who he is before everybody he's a man who claims to stand on Earth on behalf of God on behalf of God on behalf imagine that he says he actually represents St Peter and therefore whatever he's doing on Earth is on behalf of God tell me is God anti life for for for him to desire that men will be married with men and women will be married with women he's trying to say that there will be no life it is putting an end to life but God is pro life but this spirit is seeking how to come and destroy everything just like we find here in the beginning they wanted to destroy all the male child he said if he's born a male kill him but he's B if he's born a women no problem let him live the devil wants to make all women everybody women he wants to destroy the seed the seed that will serve God the seed which will seek after God the seed which will move amen and is being inspired by the word of God but the devil wants us to be inspired by the World by Hollywood by by politics by all the things going on into the world but let me tell you there is a seed that is going to serve God I believe I'm one of them and even so it doesn't mean that these demons that are in the world are not going to come they will come they will attack they will they will come but listen we have to defend ourselves we have to fight until we die young men we ought to be shouting Amen to that we have to fight until we get every one of them destroyed and let me tell you why because we have an eternal seed we have an eternal seed word in us that seed which cannot be destroyed no matter what it can only be destroyed if we let the devil do it Satan tried to destroy the true seed by going ahead of the man no wonder to the world defilement is a normal thing to to them see says what what is it a it's nothing it's a it's just it's not nothing it's not nothing for you to defile a woman that is not your wife it's not nothing for you to touch a woman that is not your wife it's not nothing and that's why people are giving birth to things that we can't understand things that are not human beings anymore can't you see that there's something happening in the world the human beings are closely closely continually heading closer to the having the animalistic nature rather than having the nature of sons of God the serpent beguiled Eve and defiled her before her husband ever knew her by defiling the womb of the woman the devil thought he had finished the Next Generation no wonder in sin the scripture says in sin did my mother your mother conceive you conceive me in sin because we were born in sin we were we were born out of a defiled womb oh thank God for Grace if if he wasn't for Grace we would all be lost when a man is born again you know sexual sins should be far removed from him how can a born again man defile the womb and the body of another man is wife see as I was studying I just wrote those words by inspiration how can a born again man defile the woman rather the womb of body of another man's wife now of course then SS will say oh no don't to your womb won't be defiled you're going to have something called a condom and you use it and and you'll be fine and everything shall go well and you you won't make her pregnant but look you've defiled her body all the same and they find that Moses Pharaoh wanted to kill the Next Generation he wanted Moses you see because why did the devil want Moses he killed wanted to kill the Next Generation because Moses was the power Hallelujah he was the power of the Next Generation by killing the sons you see but God did not allow it devil wanted to Amen to destroy the Next Generation by doing what by killing the sons but what God did not allow it the devil wants to destroy the Next Generation by killing you but God cannot allow it Hallelujah because he know if he kills you the word will have lost a power listen I am the power of tomorrow I am the power of the Next Generation I am going to have a resolution to serve and live for God oh my May God not allow the devil to kill you brother may you stand out to serve the Lord Faithfully is my prayer and the scripture says and Pharaoh charged all these people saying every son that is born ye shall cast into the river and every daughter ye shall save a life because now he noticed they have been saved alive H oh they're not dead you couldn't you couldn't kill them oh all right so now throw them into the river drown them so now the devil wanted to drown Moses you see by the decree of the devil you were cast into the river the devil wanted to drown you by the decree of the devil the devil has tried to drown you in many things you know them all the things we've mentioned up here they Dev wanted to drown you in all those things because he decreed drown them in the river but I want to say also tonight by the decree of God God picked you up Hallelujah and if you are still not up yet I'm telling you God is giving a decree God is giving a decree tonight you must come come out and I want to say hallelujah in the name of Jesus Christ when you are out when you've come out then what do you do you go forward we have a job to do Brothers we have a generation to raise we have we are the power of this next Generation we are the power and the devil tried it one more time in the New Testament in the Book of Matthew when he realized that Jesus was born and he could not stop it he said kill all the boys H he was too late the sons you kill all the sons he tried to kill all the sons they tried to kill all of them yet God allowed it this time why because it was already too late the sun had already survived the son had already survived hallelujah praise God the sons now must survive too I think it is too late for the the devil to destroy this generation I don't know about you but I want to be I want to be one that would say I am not going to even allow my next Generation to be destroyed I was in Germany with brother Tim PR and he said something that touched me so much he said I made up my mind myself and my wife we made up our mind and I made up my mind that my children will serve the Lord and he said he told him he said son he actually told me he said he told his son which his son was with us also in Germany brother Timothy put is going to preach in the youth meetings a wonderful preacher he said he said to him oh to himself I don't know which is which but he said if you will have to go in the beer party I tell you boy he said I'll go with you I'll make sure I'll will go with you and I will step on that table and I'll preach a Pentecostal sermon and I tell you you will not enjoy it with your friends because I'll mess it up with the preaching I will go there with you and I said what a resolution and when I heard those words I I felt in my heart I said oh God help me to raise a generation that would fear you not only my biological one but but even the spiritual ones you've given me help me to raise a generation that will serve you and let amen the the generation after after them serve you to to others living Christianity is just like a dream or it's just like something like a religion like but to us it shouldn't be to us it should be real friends we should me it we should live it we should manifest it we can if we if we choose to we can and we are sons and we must survive and I finish with 1 John 3:2 it says beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him hallelujah oh this is just touching me so deeply say for we shall see him as he is but here is the part that touches me now are we the sons of God not tomorrow now it's up to you to live as a Son of God now or to live like a son of the devil now but as far as I'm concerned I want to live as a Son of God now if Temptation if Temptation comes to overtake you brother listen to me God will give you strength to overcome it if you are purpose in your heart and in your mind and in your soul say I'm going to stand for the word of God yeah let it come but God will give you strength to live above it if he has done for others why not you why not you why not you you can decide to leave Lam if you want but as far as I'm concerned I want to live on fire for God I I want to to be decided I want to live a Resolute life that I'm going to serve God I'm going to live you know you can do that you can do that you can say I'm going to serve God my children are going to serve God the Next Generation after them is going to serve God and I'm going to say to it that that happens that's why Abraham told his servant Ela don't take for my son among these women here you see even it matters who you marry don't marry from among these s queens and among the you know whatever go down there in our place in our home God done there in the word amen and choose a wife for my son and out of there got a wife go how who led him God led him he wasn't even looking at how they were which figure they had which language they spoke how they were looking and their looks and their bums and everything he was looking at the word are they in the word are they part of the rest of Abraham or are they not that was the first prerequisite that you should look at but you see the devil want wants to kill this generation by letting them look at the wrong thing and he's taking the men and the young men be making themel filled up with the filth of the world he he does that with all these things if you go to Facebook I didn't have Facebook for a very long time I had it but I had disconnected it but when I looked again and cuz nowadays you have to put on VPN here in Uganda to access Facebook so when I looked again I went to my Facebook and I began crawling and everything that I don't know about you but what whatever I was seeing there was just filth filth and I don't know I did not know that Facebook used to have videos everything is just filed there when you go telegram same thing when you go to Whatsapp same thing everybody will post what they want to post and then you begin feasting on that you go on those data groups and You Begin copying all that those things and you feed on it you on a WhatsApp group that is feeding you with with filth and you remain there and you a Son of God there's a problem somewhere how could you remain in such a group exit the group and then you remain in such groups and then you arive the Believers groups because there is a wrong spirit and it wants to kill you but I'm telling you this is a voice of God to you tonight you see you can make a choice to exit some groups and stay in some and make others active because you are an active Son of God not tomorrow but now now are we the sons of God I don't want to be a Son of God later and a son of the devil now I want to be a Son of God now and I'll never be a son of the devil I have to leave for God now you see it's all filth you see all the smartphones and internet it's all filth you see comes to a place where by you know you remember when in the days of Noah when Noah told adav to go out and let it out adav couldn't find a place to put his feet it just flew right back in because everywhere was just so crazy filled with filth and uh dead bodies and stinking and it had to come back in but when he sent a crow out a crow can leave in the ark and a crow can live out in filth so you find many Christians have a spirit of a crow they can live in both you see you can go in fith and you live in there you survive and you come in the church and you survive but if I were you i' would be a dve and if you you're not a dve tonight God can make you a d by filling with the holy spirit let us stand on our feet [Music] tonight I know this song is we've not sung it before before but I sang it brother Peter and uh
