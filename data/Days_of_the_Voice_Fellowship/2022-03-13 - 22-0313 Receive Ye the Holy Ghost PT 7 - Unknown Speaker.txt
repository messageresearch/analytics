be there for one week and the malay we came and during this time we are going to have the very first ethiopian convention of a and we expect to have a wonderful wonderful time so please keep it in prayers um i know that ethiopia has been as the capital of africa it has been known as the capital of africa [Music] you know i wrote an article on the website how many were able to read it nina uh yes a good idea yes that update then the website uh it gives details about ethiopia for ethiopia and what ethiopia has been negative uh many meetings have been held in that country since 1963. and um you know heads of state a big meeting there could have been about you the organization of it was i think the organization of african unity at that time those who have gone to school you started that but then uh china recently a few years ago built for them a very big building it is not foreign during one of the meetings it happened to bring one of the brothers who is a believer of this message and he is currently i think he was elected as the chairman of the peace and security cluster something in the african union [Music] because of african union i don't know whether i don't know whether the president had previously received any of the message books many believers always go through ethiopia all of them whatever they were going through they were praying hold on let there be a worker here let there be a church here not only that ethiopian pastor organ and he actually sent you greetings amen and uh his wife's sister uh sister massey [Music] they sent you greetings to me so we shall be with them this weekend this coming weekend to get another now i need your prayers you prayed with us when we were going to that city you remember how many remember that yeah and a church started there can you senator the brother who was there is now moving away again but the church still remains the building has already been constructed it is in bibamba and but there is a vacuum of a pasta there so i would like you to join me to join them in prayers the lord will give them a man after his own heart now um i think i should just get this out of the way so that we just go into the world how many here have been faithfully fulfilling their pledges for their land contributions just by an uplifted hand don't feel shy it's not uh just just if you have been faithfully like you might have been giving everything you promised [Music] [Music] yes okay now uh those ones who have not been giving you how many desire to in their heart you desire to give bamboo but here i just want to encourage you brother brother marvin those who did not come on friday organ you really missed out brother marvin brother my voice is still not yet very good my audio so the brother marvin preached a very good summon very good summoner amen he spoke about the promises that god has given to us they say that god has given the promises that whatever it is up to us today to claim those promises you have to claim your promises of you if i tell you this is yours then you should claim it if i tell you it is yours brother this phone is all going to see when you're you and i put it in my pocket 90 day come on so is it yours can you answer me church is it yourself and that's how many of us are where do you have a singer when god gives us his promises we we just look at them and we say we believe in it to be kidding we accept it amen but we don't claim it need it to be banned and so god has promised to us give us the desires of our hearts [Music] someone told me that why do you collect maybe the rapture will happen will happen but if the rapture happens i do not want to be found folding my i think to me that is a good thing because the rapture will still happen whether or not you collect money and god will give to us according to our faith cartoon that that took a video with two kids you grow old okay you have children get married you're still renting in a school bank it is not your work as an individual it is the work of god and if you give to the lord you have learned the lord you have left the lord and you can never let him take the sabbath and he can that you can never pay back i want to challenge you as a church jagarabbas that do all you can to sacrifice collect your natural suburbs and give towards this cause if you have to sacrifice of us here have children bandicoot um i see several families with children and others are getting married we have two weddings in may alone hallelujah i believe we shall be dedicated in the other one very soon tomorrow and soon he will have three maybe as i don't know and maybe i don't know obama this place cannot be enough for us we behind that and praise the lord so these are things that we don't speak about much you know they have intervention but i thought i should really bring down my burden to you because the lord has already proved to us it's going to work we are standing in his word 20 minutes so those of you who raised up your hands and have not given anything oh you may have promised two hundred thousand a month of course and maybe you didn't get it in lump sum and you kept on saying i will give you i will give you i will give you how long has it taken if you've been abandoned and you've given maybe nothing last time you you spoke in the church publicly you said every day can collect this much sister i was going to ask you whether how much you are living praise the lord come here um and i i think there's somebody who told me they gave last time and they were never raped we have collected eight million and four hundred forty nine thousand zero [Music] hallelujah many believers don't want to hear things about money but the more they do not want to hear about them the more they do not progress you see what i love about god he's a changer his word has principles you stand by his principles and he blesses you there's a principle in giving what went on and so we are progressing to vienna there are now many ways hallelujah is that laughter meaning you have faith oh it means you are doubting it we can be able to move in a place where whether we are finished or not dreaming i'm not dreaming i'm speaking reality oh yeah god bless you amen stand with me on your feet it was important i take my time on that it's 12th sabbath and as usual during this series i desire to always

the image of the spoken word now we find out we found out that he loved the image and he needed a reconciliation comment and he needed a redemption a radiator those words redemption reconciliation
