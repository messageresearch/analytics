five to 10 minutes to tell us the testimonies of what the lord has done and what you expect a lot to do in the coming days from where he speaking your sound is more than you found clothes [Music] okay so you might need to come a bit closer okay go ahead the journey there has been a blessing to me i started it well from here going there we reached sorority from sorority i proceeded to mira from lyra to kitabun that is when the devil tried to fall when we reached the way the tax got spoiled and the time was a bit late and there were the that's a good point i didn't know anyone in that place and i didn't have any contact my my phone went off and i didn't know anyone in the taxi so they got started what i decided to do the time was going late it was going to 3 p.m to 9 p.m so there was nothing i could do then what i had to do i had to pray to go to oakland to at least give me wisdom where should i go and sleep by that time had this been that i was not a child of god i would have got problems there when i prayed everyone was just leaving the taxi everyone because the people i sat with their home was nearly the left were only three in the taxi and the two women stayed next to the driver only me was going too far then they came and repaired the that's and by that time nobody going where i was going no no no tax going where i was going so i started there what god gave me that was done i pretended not to understand my own language by the time we drove the the driver took the two with me now i was alone with the driver in the attacks so the driver started talking but things thinking that made me i don't understand the language even he called he called a woman that ah i have a girl here so you have to get for me a lot what yet me was understanding everything was saying about me then after understanding what he was planning to do i had to introduce myself i had my i didn't pop my bible in the back i had it in my hand like this so i had to introduce myself to him i told him i'm a christian i entered i introduced myself into detail even i tried to preach to you by that time that man got so scared he could not do what he was planning to do then what she did by that time he drove me straight to a pastor's home when went there the pastor's home again i continued pretending i wanted to know what they're planning really again the past time at that pastor's home there was nothing but they were hey this girl is so good she's a nice girl and you see the way she's dressing every good things about me i realized that pastor have nothing but plan with me then i stayed in in the during in the evening because even they have the service in the evening the way we always have fear after prayer i started sharing with that pastor i shared with that pastor he was receiving it i gave him the church egg book and track he really liked it and he told me he's going to go first about this he told me this thing is real you wait i'll call you pastor in the morning i left going there i was also meeting other pastors i went in the church of which also i've preached to the pastor and the pastor called him i didn't know that he called him but i got a message from here that he could going there all people were just happy when i told rama i told them after giving trots i told them my pastor will come here one day people were so excited they were just willing to receive the message and they told me immediately after giving the drugs i think they they really failed it they started registering people's name for baptism i don't know how they will do it i think they will need hope from pasta they started even right now as i took i left them registered because they were so willing to receive and to another place a bit further in the same district but very far i met some i made i met a catholic priest and passed a pastor for pentecost we were like three people i shared with them only one received that day and the two the the catholic and the other one did not receive anything they were like abusing they were like i was they told me that you are the people from underwater yoga we don't want your message but only one person got their revelation and up to now i'm waiting he will call me but he has received it he also he thanks me for going there and another one another teacher catechist for catholic also he received it and is waiting for pastor to go there to tell you more yes i talk now many people even my my own parents my mother has believed and either my my uncle brother to my father's belief the young people just waiting again coming back the other pastor slept at his place i didn't i didn't go to his name i didn't get his number but i was thinking now that first half i've been preaching to him and there's nothing i can do and i did pick his number what we like you say i think god will bring his number to me when i was coming passing that place i was remembering as if i slept beside but i could not remember it so well then there's a man who entered the [Music] the bus and the contractor was telling him to go behind he told the conductor let me sit next to my daughter here when he sat next to me we drove a bit then i started preaching to him then he asked me i gave him truck he read from there then he started asking who's your pastor where do you pray oh what is your name where do you stay i answer then i ask him why do you pray from kit kung he told me who's your pastor it was a real pastor i slept at this place which the person i was looking for his number god brought it then that man came then i said you mean you pray you you're praising that pastor's church that yes then i said that is fine now from my others saying thank you go that man gave me his number and he told me if i come he will be calling and we call it that's all amen you know one thing amazing about all this is we know that the bible says that women are not supposed to be preachers women should not worship authority over the man the scripture right but let this be a testament to all of us that because god told the woman that our office is not teaching or preaching it does not necessarily mean she cannot witness you understand in ethiopia when we went there it was a woman that god used to help us get to very many people and very many people believe so i still believe even now god can change very many people in that area there is no message chat in that area god can change very many you've already had that many work within regulators two pastors have already called me they have communicated with me and they are willing to meet with us so let's pray that when the time comes for us to go there it will yield for you hallelujah and i want to say that whoever will believe there either directly or indirectly it is afraid of diseased by muslims right yes so this is not in vain amen so we are waiting also for testimony some of you going there giving trust just giving up rights tell you there's a message there's a message you know they were reading those tracks out there then they would call me and ask me because of that tracks i would also ask for literature about sap and seed water baptism body you know you know so they will read and ask you understand and now we are making these books here the ones we are printing currently oh it's going to be a blast hallelujah it just be so wonderful so we just give them out everywhere among those people and you know i'm just on fire when i see god bringing in people to receive this world you know sooner soon very soon we are living in this old one so where will we go if we are not prepared ourselves first of all we need to prepare ourselves and prepare others also that are going to go with us where else you know it's just like going in a bus station and sitting down you are ready to go but people are not others are late so if they are late you're also going to remain in the bus around for one hour or two hours until everybody comes and joins you and then the battle starts so don't ever think you're going to interrupt before everybody else comes in the last member of the building press has to come in then off we go how many are waiting for that time amen right amen so uh i'd like us to uh straight away go now to our uh to our chapter of the factual church age okay so we shall [Music] just to try and magnify this once a bit [Music] okay [Music] [Applause] the last part of the image the last world power was in the feet okay you can use something here's like well there were five eastern nations there i think we're going to the final warning right yeah [Music] revelation 2 23 23 and i will kill her children with death and all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth the reigns and hearts and i will give unto every one of you according to your works god looketh on the heart that has never changed neither will it ever change here is through all the ages there are just a moment revelation 2 23 and i will kill her children with death all the churches shall know that i am he which searcheth and i will give unto every one of you according to your works that has never changed neither will it change here as through all the ages there are two groups both proclaiming their revelation from god and their relationship to god nevertheless the foundation of god standeth sure having this seal the lord knoweth them which are his second timothy 2 19 the lord searcheth the reigns the word search means to track or follow up god tracks down our thoughts reigns he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us it is out of the heart that precedes either righteousness or wickedness our motives our purposes all are known unto him as he watches every action and every action every word shall be a judgment when the accounting for our lives is given do you see that he knows what is in our hearts and sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us i want us to understand this question please giving your attention to it can i can you put it on the screen what i'm sharing here the project of this okay okay everybody can see that okay he says god tracks down our thoughts our reigns thoughts he knows what is in our hearts sister are we together you're missing out i want you to concentrate he says god knows what is in our hearts god knows what you're thinking god knows what is in you he sees our works which are a definite manifestation of what lies within us did you know that the things you do is a proper manifestation of who you are you cannot say i am doing this but actually i am not like that you might see me painting myself but i am a believer you might see me wearing a mini skirt but actually i believe in my heart that's a lie because jesus said it is not what goes in a man that does what you find him it is what defines the man what comes up you understand when you eat the food it is all good but when you vomit it that's when we shall know what is in you no one will want to come near that food which you are vomiting right so what am i trying to say what you do on the outside shows what is on the inside you cannot do something bad and you are good it is impossible you cannot dress badly and you are a christian it is impossible you cannot treat others in a negative way when in your heart you are good but i meant well my heart was good and yet you are treating others it is a clear sign that even in inside you you are bad you are what is coming out of you shows what is in you that's why when we are preaching in this message we don't want to see the change on the outside we have had very many people having a change on the outside they dress like stains they talk and i say oh they just you know when they kind of pretend that they love you you think i am rich this is heaven for me but straight from their toys what does it mean to step on your toy but the banana uses that phrase very many times it simply means let someone annoy you then you will show them your two colors let someone do something that is bad that you don't like and then you will now open yourself clearly you will show them your true colors you will show them revenge you will show them hatred you will show them uh you know things like that speaking of goddamn revenge children of god don't do something to hurt another one because they hurt you children of body don't do something because someone has done bad therefore let it is a clear sign you are you yourself you are not changed you are worse than they are a person who is bad is the one who claims to be good and yet he has he's not good that one is even bad but at least the one who is bad and he knows he's bad and he doesn't claim to be good that one is okay he can literally get it in a moment but the one who claims to be good and is actually bad is a very very dangerous individual there are for my friends we are all bad by nature by bath and this world is supposed to make us good you cannot be good but only god make a good good by the power of his wife therefore what you do on the outside shows what you are on the inside you cannot claim to be good on the inside and you are treating others in a bad way you can't learn to be good on the inside and you don't love others you can't claim to even love god himself when you have love for your brethren and how can you claim to love your brethren when you cannot help them when they're in trouble and when you cannot be there for them when they need you then jesus himself said that if someone has a something and someone needs something and he comes to you and he says my brother i need you to help me i'm hungry and then you tell them may god bless you may he feel you may he make you prosper may you may he give you all the blessings there and then those people they go out there after you've blessed them and instead of you touch going down deep into your pocket and taking something and giving them you can't you have it and you can't and you're great to be a big christian that kind of percentage is not the true percentage that the government speaks of christianity you must be able to feel for others the things you do indeed show who you are are you hearing me so god tracks down our thoughts our reigns he knows what is in our hearts he sees our works which are a definite read with me now manifestation the ones i just write there i read it in red it sees our words come on now which are definitely of what lies within us it is out of the heart that proceeds in the righteousness out of that weekend our parties you can tell your dad or your mom or whoever it is that look at where to bible study but your motive he's not your bible said your mother exactly to go see a friend or your mother is after to go out somewhere and meet someone else that you are motive well of course you might say that but god sees your motive that's why many people even are not blessed for example you pay your tithe let me but now even what is making me poor even now is taking my money because you are and yet you are paying tight don't they ever expect god to bless you out of that because you are your mother is not right some of you even pay tithe to be rich if you're better experienced you will always be poor let me put let me tell you that god sees your motive why are you doing something better play type or give to others or give offering for the lord out of the abundance of your heart for the love of god you do it because you love him that's why the bible says that god loves a cheerful forgiver who is a cheerful giver the one who gives when they happen not again now they have taken even that one after you have given and indeed you think you are a cheerful giver and shall forgive us all who gives and feel so nice and happy oh you give someone an oh they're happy you're like oh praise the lord yeah that feels so good huh yeah but it's a natural thing you can't even make it up you can't even make it up if you don't have that ask god to give it to you ask me to feed you the one of us you will have it naturally i mean when you know then god will see that and he wants you hallelujah he blesses you it makes you to prosper when you give to the lord you give your free when you do something you do it cheerfully when you help others you do it cheerfully you understand yes god says our purpose says why are you doing what you are doing oh you're doing it so that they can know that you can do it or you're doing it so that they can know that you're good or you're doing it so they can't know you know you know i was talking with some brother today about giving you know when you are giving someone don't expect to receive game knowing that you are doing good you're cheerful you're doing good for the glory of the name of our god all are known unto him as he watches every action there is nothing you are going to do to deceive any man you can receive man right but you cannot deceive god god cannot be deceived even the bible says god cannot be mocked have you not read that scripture before god cannot be mocked therefore when you are doing something when you are coming for the bible saturday here when you are going for prayer like some of you were in the church today when you're doing anything for the lord or even for your brothers and sisters don't ever think that you are going to mock god god knows your every action there is nothing he does not and he started the reigns at the heart he knows what is in your heart and every action and every word shall be brought into judgment when the accounting for our lives is given why did you do what you did you were asking do you can you give accountability for your action you know i was thinking it is easy to give someone it is easier for you to receive any amount of money right but it is very hard for you to account for it i've often seen that among the young people raise you give them 10 or twenty or a hundred thousand or two hundred thousand and then tell them give me accountability afterwards it's like as if you have beaten them how could you do that but yet it is easy for you to receive it so god has given you all your life god has given you life he has given you help he has given you all you needed to be alive and now that you have what you have god is going to one day put you to accountability whatever you gave did you ever realize that the life you have you're going to account for it the things you do you're going to account for them everyone shall be brought into judgment even everyone you speak shall be brought to judgment everywhere when accounting for our lives is given there was no fear of god before the false vine and the dearly and theory shall they pray the first value will beat the eye they are petty eyes why why because there was no fear of god before them that's why we are should not go when we do things you know some people do things without a fear of god at all not the fear of god at all but let me tell you if you don't have the fear of god in your heart you're a force fight and if you're forced by that it means you are i'm sorry to say stop and see but i'm glad i'm talking to the seed of god amen if you know something is wrong and you are going to do it maybe you even let up your mind let me do it today help me but i slightly cold then you guys let me do it but let me tell you if you're a child of god immediately something will build up in your heart then if you will feel fear from nowhere ah i can't do it on my chest i just can't do it i just can't do it what is happening because you're a child of god you are true fine he will not let you do it he will put that fear that's why but a man had to fight his way to hell i'm not going to fight his way to hell did you know for you to go ahead you have to fight so much you fight with the angel of the lord he tells you no he puts fear on you no come on you can't wear that clouds are you a child oh god yes remember you're like ah why did you say god no then the fear of god will come here and then to clear out that point if you don't have the holy ghost you just go right ahead you will pass all the barricades and that's what it means grace we are served by grace because some of us did those things by unbelief but the grace brought us out of the world and grace he did not count as if we did anything you forgive us amen he wash us with his blood and then he said i've given you now another life that's why i said the other life is dead now i i it's not me that believe it that used to live now i'm a new creation you know the song i'm a new creation i'm a brand new man sing with me now all things are faster i've been born again [Music] [Music] i'm a brand new man can we go sing it one more time now i'm a new creation i'm a brand new i've man born again [Music] [Music] i am a brand new man all right all the things are passed away is that is that girl looking is she awake all right okay all things are passed away i've been i've been born again what does it mean to be born again the one who used to live no like this when they see you again someone who saw that you you were their boyfriend and they look at you again and they want to call you and to go back in those old things you asked excuse me that's not the right person you're talking to i don't know you i don't know you this way maybe the one you know is old he died [Applause] temptation must come it should come if it doesn't come to you then don't what are you already dangling and dancing with the devil the objection must come every day this is on a daily basis that's why usually we have many services in a week because it is the hours of strength we hear the translation becomes it every day not even every day do we you know we have to go through it we have to conquer that temptation when that hash comes on you you remember all those things i want to do the fear of god will come on you because you are true friend then you [Music] [Music] all of them and so he thought he should also get himself a girlfriend and he got one girl and they went together with killed the other boys in a in a car and that's you know as young people you know yeah they're listening and they're laughing and yeah yeah so as they went out there he was very young there and then of course the voice of when they come to him and that he said don't smoke drink or they fight your body anyway for you to do when you get older so yeah everybody knew that voice and always came to him but this time they were together and they don't so you had a girlfriend now he thought he had one and secondly uh you know yeah he can't even smoke the boy the girls were even laughing at him and you know if a guy ran upset you the boys were like teasing him said okay i'd smoke so as he took it to smoke and he was putting on this that presence of god came upon you know it him as a white wind and and the voice he knew what type of voice he would come out of that weed and he used to feel around so much so he put that in front of the cigarette and he decided to run now he started he was having the fear of god when you have the fear of whether we call you all sorts of names but you stand amen because you are conquered you are conquering heaven and this life amen let everybody what they want to call you because you have a holy if you're going to be a citizen of this world and do the things they do go ahead you don't have the fear of god but as for me and my house hallelujah family are part of my house god wants a young people a younger generation that is going to hold on onto the word of god and say that's what i have a mother conqueror and now we will continue here this question which we have started with is really so nice he says that and every action every action everywhere shall be brought into judgment every word every action shall be brought into judgment did you know that everyone every action shall be brought into into judgment when the accounting for our lives is given there was no fear of god before the first vine and the irish they shall pray let all whose names let all who name his name so leave us becometh if your name in the name of the lord as a christian i'm a christian i'm a child of god then leave as one leave us one we might fool the people can you read that last bit please everyone because you realized because the lord knows all things he knows even what you are planning now he doesn't even know what you are thinking he knows what he knows all your plans we sing that song every night every day here right you know how does it go i've worked with alone through sunshine and darkness i cannot forsake his wife listen to these words all these great commands temptations are great but god's love still greater he knows all about me yes gold [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] oh he's willing to help me or if [Music] never forget that let us look at the promise of us that days in revelation revelation 2 24-25 but unto you i say and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine and which have not known the depth of satan as they speak i will put upon you none other burden but that which ye have already hold fast till i come now before we go into the promise let me show again that the church as spoken of by the spirit in this book has two vines whose interwinding branches compose it but i say unto you and unto the rest in thyatira as many as have not this doctrine there it is he is speaking to the two groups one has the doctrine another has not there they are scattered abroad across the nations with each one's doctrine opposing the other one is of god knowing his depths the other of satan knowing the depths of satan i will put upon you none other burden the word for burden is weight or pressure the pressure of the dark ages was either bend or be broken bow or die it was the inquisition the power of the empire backing up satanic worship be organized or pay with your life each age had its pressures for example a great burden of the last age is the pressure of riches soft living and nervous tensions in a complex age that we seem unfitted to live in this fourth age seems to have had a clear-cut burden it was to defy rome stand up for the word even unto death they have not known the depths of satan it seems that this verse has been left out by the commentators for they were not able to figure out what doctrine or what experiences are meant by this phrase before we continue down here it says that each age up here uh [Music] yeah no one i knew that i may miss it so i had to go there immediately why does it talk about this age each ads right here yes it says each age had expressions for example a great burden of the last age this is our age that we are living in is the pressure of riches did you know that that you know the the edges we have been through every age that is precious what is the pressure of the edge of saturn ah no no what is the age of the altera what what what did the believers in the in saturn face ah join the nomination or die that was their pressure they persecuted them to join their organized religion they joined that organized religion the catholic church or they died the time of the inquisition we we talked about it we read that i think about the last time what was the time of the imposition the time of the inquisition was when they say that they established an organization where by if you do not join if you do not uh believe what the church is doing you are called you are called a heretic i heard it was a person who actually i i to do heresy is to believe first doctrine right so if you are considered and erected by the judge you will be killed it would matter you don't kill you so you either check them or you die that was the pressure that they had but the pressure we have today if you can enjoy any church you want to join you can be anywhere you want to be you can even stay home for all your life that's no problem you may even know to go to church that's up to you if you you know it's a generation of rights here right it's your right to stay at home it's your right to go to church huh it's your right to go to school if you don't want to go to school by the way it's you're right you don't know that it's all right you can just go out to court and say well i don't have to go to school as long as as long as it's your right you know but of course the country also has goals whereby you have to have education up to this level or that kind of label after that you say when's my right i don't want to go to university no one will take me there so right and and many even the united states don't get education they don't work it's the right can imagine it's their right and the government gives them what we need and imagine the our generation is rewarding even lessons so it's the right it's our this is the generation of rights what are you going to say me i don't want to marry a a a woman i want to marry a man it's right i don't want to marry a woman i'm a man i'm a woman but i want to marry a woman they're doing it everywhere it's their right but also it will be their right to go to hell of course but you as a believer you also have rights it's our right to overcome the pressures of our age and nobody no one should look in front of you i tell you you cannot it is you are right to overcome it if they want to do it you don't want to do it and it is also your right they should respect it hallelujah what's the pressure of our age which is the last age soft living another extensions in a complex age that we seem undefeated to live in the fourth age seems okay well of course all right before i get there to the fourth edge here it says for example the great battle of the last ages the pressure of riches reaches that's why all titles are prophesying people rangers rachel can't immediately launch here [Music] people are leaving others to train others all in the name of riches people are leaving their countries to go in arab camps or in the name of riches not that they don't have what to eat they have what to eat they are not going to sleep but they want to be rich they want to be like so and so they want to drive like so and so and they don't want to just drive a car they just want to have a real car like like somebody they don't want to just have a house they want to have a real house like somebody they don't want to just have you understand these kind of things so this is the pressure of our generation please let us overcome this pressure let us overcome the pressure from this direction to be rich let us overcome the pressure for self-leaving let us overcome the pressures from our perceptions we find people going with those people because they're nervous they're crazy they become crazy because they're nervous it is the pressures of the breath the pressures of the generation and the fourth age also had a actually it is simple to know what is meant let us first know what the depth of god is and the opposite will be true for the depth of satan in ephesians 3 16 that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith that ye being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth and length and depth and height and to know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of god now according to these verses when a man experiences the depth of god in his life it is an actual personal experience of the spirit of god indwelling him and his mind is illuminated by the wisdom and knowledge of god through the word but the depth of satan will be and that he will attempt to destroy this he will as always attempt to make a substitute for this reality of god how will he do it he will take away the knowledge of the truth of god destroy the word by putting forth his own yea hath god said he will then substitute the personal christ in our spirits he will do it as he caused israel to do the same by a human being reigning as king instead of god the born-again experience will be rejected in favor of church joining the depths of satan had been entered into in that age and the fruit of that depth of satan which are lies murders and horrible crimes came forth from it the rewards revelation 2 26-29 and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will i give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron potter shall they be broken even as i received of my father and i will give him the morning star he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh and keepeth my works to the end it is very evident from the remarks of the spirit on works that the lord is trying to get his own to see his opinion of righteous works four times he mentions works and now he says that he who keeps doing his works faithfully until the end will be given power over nations and will be a strong capable unbending ruler who can cope so powerfully with any situation that even the most desperate enemy will be broken if need be his demonstration of rule by power will be like unto the very sons this is very amazing but let us look at this promise in the light of the age powerful rome with state backing employing kings and armies and legislators breaks and grinds all before it she has killed millions and hungers to kill millions more who will not bow to her she intolerantly sets up kings or brings them low whenever she can yea her interference has actually caused nations to fall because she has determined to destroy the elect of god her works are the works of the devil for she murders and lies as did he but there is coming a day wherein the lord is going to say bring these mine enemies before me and slay them then shall the righteous be with their lord when his righteous indignation will fall upon the blasphemers the righteous coming with him in glory shall destroy those who destroyed the earth and made havoc of the saints of god this was the age of turning the cheek of terrible distress but a day is coming when truth shall prevail and who shall stand in its fire and be safe only the redeemed of the lord and i will give him the morning star according to revelation 22 16 and 2 peter 1 19 jesus is the morning star i am the root and offspring of david the bright and morning star until the day dawn and the day star arise in your hearts the spirit is therefore making a promise to the elect of the dark ages relative to himself and then in the ages to come as we have already stated jesus identifies himself with the messengers of each age they receive from him the revelation on the word for each period this word revelation brings the elect of god out of the world and into full union with jesus christ these messengers are called stars because they shine with a borrowed or reflected light of the sun even jesus they are also called stars because they are holders of light at night thus in the darkness of sin they bring the light of god to his people this is the dark ages it is especially dark for the word of the lord is almost entirely hidden from the people that's right knowledge of the most high has almost ceased death has overcome vast numbers of the believers until their ranks are decimated the things of god are at the lowest ebb to this date and it seemed that satan would surely conquer god's people if ever a people needed a promise embracing the land where there is no light it was the people of the dark ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star he is telling them that the chief star even jesus who dwelleth in light unto which no man will continue what's the dark ages which generation among all the churches why why it's unfollowing but you can't discuss this is a bible study it's not a preaching moment so i'm not preaching to you i want us to contribute sorry yes what what why why else okay it says that this is the dark edges it is especially dark for the word of the lord is almost entirely hidden from because remember in that tattoo actually even was it on the longest age very long time over over a thousand years where the the trinity doctrine was preached as a as the true doctrine imagined where the people were killed for simply going against the catholic church where no one was allowed to preach but only the priests where the denomination had already established and was killing anyone who went against you the one of god was almost hidden from the people knowledge of the most high knowledge of jesus christ was almost seized the truth was no longer preached you understand data has overcome vast numbers of the believers until their rights are dismissed vast numbers of believers so that means decimated meaning until all of them are killed all the other of them are almost wiped out you understand the things of god are the lowest aim to this day and it seemed that saturn would be sure to conquer these people it seemed as if the devil had the people of god in his hands some of you were having a no but you didn't have an overnight you you always have to half day uh i i don't know why some of you are announcing if you're doing please stand up all right so then it says again here if ever our people needed a promise embracing the land where there is no night it was the people of the darker ages and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star he is telling them that the chief staff even jesus who beareth in light and to which no man can approach will in the future kingdom illuminate them by his own personal presence he will not be using the stars or messengers to give light in darkness any longer it will be jesus himself speaking to them face to face as he shares his kingdom with them some of these songs came during these days in a city where there's a light the city where [Music] and there's another shall be right in the evening time you know this during this man right now most of these songs we've seen but some of these we are going to give you these edges because they were going through situations difficult situations the great songs out of it the british comes out of it that's how we see that this holy ghost goes fair is dripping with blood the [Applause] what who is the souls these brothers were suffering dying they would drink these things and then with the ink you know with ink and and and they have all you know roster feathers will use feathers and an ink to rank these things so that they can preserve it so that you and i can be able to be a beneficiary of it because they went through it they suffered they died because of this message and here we are now we have all the freedom we can have to preach what we want to preach to believe what we want to believe and we don't do it and not believe it and we're not seeing it with it how are you going to start with those who suffered and died for it tell me if you are not serious for it but yeah there are some others who died for it how can you stand together and say you will be the same rapture is it even possible so how serious must you be in this generation this year and that is why the spirit is promising them the morning star where of course jesus christ is the morning star he's telling them that the chief star even jesus who dwelt in light unto which no man can approach will in the future keep them eliminate them by his own personal presence hallelujah praise the name will in the future kingdom illuminate them by his own personal presence he will not be using the stars messengers to give light in darkness any longer it will be jesus himself speaking to them face to face as he shares his kingdom with them it is the morning star that is visible when the light of the sun commences to shine when our sun jesus comes there will be no further need of messengers he will bring us his message of cheer himself and as he rules his kingdom and we live in his presence the light of the word will become brighter and brighter in our perfect day of jesus himself is he not everything even perfect everything he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit so someone who wrote ourselves yes say it it's just about home time now i see a [Music] [Music] my [Music] amen lord have never been this whole sick before amen i have not been this homesick before i want to see that i want to get there i want to get to heaven when i saw the light i saw the light [Applause] [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] praise the name of the lord amen even so lord god by thy spirit let us hear thy truth wasn't that wonderful it was the next week hallelujah and now that we have some more time yeah it is everybody what you learned out of it and i want each of you to tell me what you've learned if there is nothing that you have learned i'm going to question you if you don't tell me what you have learned i'm going to question you if you have questions you can bring them on as well we can give you that before we close yes so shall we go one by one oh i'll let you just and even those who are online you are you you are allowed to bring in your questions post your question there in the in the chat um here on zoom if you are on youtube you can do that as well we can pick it from there just post a question from that that you you have from this earth factorial charge 8 and we can be able to get to that and if you don't have questions then we will go straight away to ask everybody what they have learned and of course if you have learned something you don't need to go back and pop it and shake it you just need to tell us it's if your blood is in your heart it is in your heart even if it's just something small like this so everybody please as unless you have a question i expect everybody books to be closed close some people i i i'm going to read something they're telling me they're blinded no no no close your mind yeah god bless you for that okay you have a question yes you've learned something all right brother son yes go ahead and tell us yeah you you can stay okay all right you want to come see is it about this side [Music] okay go ahead but i really pour can you please continue that's a very good lesson that's a very good lesson yes go ahead go ahead and tell us yes yourself yes why can't you deceive each of them you cannot receive that you cannot receive god yes you have seen that from the turtle church age right yes okay then you cannot receive the devil because the devil is the father of life so he's a father of lies himself his experience in life is the father of it he's the one who makes it up all right go ahead and when because you're going to continue many people don't fear lies let me tell you if you don't fear to lie and you're a believer you you are in a very sort of state telling lies telling lies means you are an associate of the devil you you know you are false witness the bible calls it never tell lies always say the truth speak the truth the bible says the truth shall set you free even if you have done something so wrong and you know when you say the truth it will lead you to problems say it and god will stand with you so brother those are two people you can't lie yourself then yourself then then you can fly god the devil too oh yeah you're the one told us about you cannot lie that therefore you got like god and then you don't like the devil yourself oh yes how can you like yourself because because the devil is so obviously you know you will obviously know that indeed the devil spoke to me not god god bless you god bless you so much my brother see this young man has really given us a very good lesson this is a very good thing that he has learned out of the fact hallelujah always beef true witness god knows everything in your heart god sees it god knows he can search the reigns of your heart therefore if you want to be a christian be a good christian if you want to be a beautiful man if you want to be a person to be [Music] a christian then be the best and you say you're going to receive good blessings out of each decision you will make if you are going to christian god is going to bless you amen if you are a good worldly person the devil is going to bless you so which way take the blessing of the of the one but some put one leg in in the wild god can't bless them and they put one leg in it in the road then the devil can also trust them so they never can trust you god can trust him so we will trust him so the devil will use you and god will what god will anoint you only because if you come under the anointing when the word of god is there the god will turn to you it's just an anointing but actually i'm using you many times so you would just be that they don't want to use you but you won't also trust you so you better go there that they will trust you than to come in here and no one can trust you but i don't know about you but as for me i decided a long time ago to stand and let go trust me a hundred percent have you seen him have you seen him and that the devil will look down because he knows indeed that he cannot get do you know that he never knows there's some people we can't get do you know that they never know there's something we can't get to hear but he trains every day he tries every day to see how we can get to them but he knows he cannot but he tries every day checks in on them is there a girl especially those demons that were already walking through you know when you were born before you believe you know they never always would use them because they they are literally they know they know you very well so that they have had to experience with you so he will always send them hey go and check so they will come when they come to capture your attention so the devil will throw that word to see how you respond if you are a true christian you will say please don't call me that i am not comfortable with that just call me my name i i'm i'm comfortable with that then the other person i'm saying but he knows he knew he knew that he got something because he cannot lie he knew that the devil was using him to jump to you like that so when you throw a very strong word i'm sorry i didn't mean it then you are probably just immediately because the devil knows you will go back and give me the point the person is too strong the person is [Music] bring my hand to demonstrate let us god attack hey our contact has resumed he was dead now he's alive and they will make a certain celebration in here he will come with thousands of demons to attack him before you know it you won't come out of him i was talking to one brother so how did you but i was like you see they're probably about happy i was hugging sisters not so much and one visitor is talking about neighbors amen if you know it is wrong to have the opposite sex when they are not your husband or wife why do you accept to do it or why do you accept someone just to be to you if you knew it is wrong if it is wrong definitely it will give you wrong feels therefore you can't deceive yourself you can't receive god you can't say that all these people are your partners somehow but let the devil be always means me our brother let the devil be a witness that he has seen who i am let him always be my witness to her let him always go back and tell all the other devils and hair itself that that guy you can't get him you know you know how the devil is fascinated when he always those demons which are assigned to you take back a negative report do you know how it fulfills all hell ah that young man oh you can't get you i've tried all my best what did you do i decided to go through all the friends i tried to go through it even when they were searching they got these bad videos it came but the person just put it off you know i tried i have failed to get him don't think that things happen by accident some of them they never bring them to you and the bible says you're not tempted by god you're tempted by your own lust so you see the devil knows how to get you there if i don't think that you can lie to yourself or god or the devil therefore be a walker with jesus christ to overcome the world to be a conqueror hallelujah and if you're going to be a believer be the best always be in prayer you know whether it's the prayer meeting at church go there on when is this some sisters go there for prayer so sisters if you want to also call people for prayer meetings you can always join them it's good you know [Music] if it comes to the word believe the word if it comes to you know uh with nursing and telling people about who you are don't hide some people they think they can be good crystals but hide it it means that you already failed before you have started if you have your very good friend this one is because if you don't want your some of your friends to know who you are or what you feel they will feel negative about you then it means that you are lacking somehow god bless you who else has something that they have learned right yes [Music] [Music] so that they can put them down something like that then i understood that the church is like a woman our father the church is like what is our father so we shouldn't the is amen have you seen that she has laughed that there is a wrong spirit of jezebel which is a dominating spirit whenever you see at any place or in any place you see a woman trying to dominate authority to dominate a man to rule the man that there is a wrong spirit there god has not intended for a woman to dominate over the men a woman should always be found in a position or place of humility what i say always wear in the church she should always be found in a place of humility not wanting to accept authority over men or to control them in the whole family you find sometimes your homes whereby it is almost women controlling men some of them you find them shouting at them at them and the man is creating like a slave if you ever get into that sister don't ever let that spirit enter you because the spirit of disability you find a woman controlling your hand like a remote you know a man has to call her and fear the man you know and fear the woman that is wrong it's not a good spirit the spirit of death are there and we find that same spirit also in the church the church is a woman the church must never control people oh if you've been following from the very beginning you have seen how god has been a blessing us through these church ages to see how a true church must always have two identifications number the true manifestation of the power of god hallelujah church now the man who controls the church but what has a man right and who is the man who is the man together who is the man that rules over the church who is the man that rules over the church one more time raise up your hand on one person raise up your hand because if you are giving a chorus answers yes bro okay right who is the man not fear brother who's the power who's the man who is the man the pastor right he said the pastor is the highest authority in the world we have very many offices in the church we have police for you know very closely we have the leak on board the trustees those ones who manage the money and everything and then the deacons who are like police officers and to ensure that the faith is kept and people who are trying to come and bring this order to try to make them be getting older we have the sunday school superintendent children's who manage the children and ensure that their children are taught well so the ushers of course those are the the sisters who are gifted you know the people that you know on singing and all that kind of thing other gifts in the nice picture gives a minute so you know somebody that is among the yeah now all those offices and night and the gifts in the church they defy the church right we also have the fivefold miniski okay pastor teacher apostle a prophet and an evangelist yeah you call him preacher so now all these five are sent to the church to edify the church but now the brother says the pastor his office is the highest authority in the church but now many people stop there but in the church we found out that the parliament is teaching that how does the pastor rule over the church by the way yes and by the spirit of god hallelujah so if any man is ruling over the church controlling the people in the church not by the miracles not by the the the word of god is not a god called man a god called man will always guide the people rule over the people by the word of god and by the holy spirit amen then also we have seen that the church of jesus christ is a female a woman okay yes because a woman always is a symbol for a church so we see spiritually a church is a woman and spiritually christ is the hospital of the church now but we have seen that this this first church that the bible calls the mother of alex the roman catholic church which grew up and here in the satirical church age it controls she controlled the people the believers the church they said we the church we the church we are the ones controlling they even keep those who refuse to believe the church's doctrine now that kind of church is not a true church of god the child must never control people when i say the church i mean the deductions of the church or the pastor himself or the leaders of the church they must never come the system can never control people the church is only physical but the spiritual church of christ will only a better word of god hallelujah but that does not mean to say pastor preaches something he said pastor please what i even say we have the holy spirit we are also people like that if the pastor is preaching something that is from the word of god and by the power of holy ghost you must never never disrespect it that's where we also going for another message recipients you must always respect and by the ban says if you can't respect the man respect the office but also if the man what is preaching or what is propagating is not of god then he doesn't walk away okay say nothing about it imagine that's how we are trained in the message right if i say something or if a man of god will say something that you don't agree with say this one pastor is wrong don't begin with putting posters right you know i can't say pastor is wrong everybody is wrong you understand that's not the spirit of god either the spirit of god what will it do you will humble yourself and leave the man along hallelujah do not go into those engagements those are kind of pull out and let the man alone even the banham says if i preach something that you don't agree with that suddenly the word of god that you don't agree with it leave it alone and you better leave something around than to fight it and then you find that you have faith in god how do you know amen oh what your sister is very good in that spirit and your sisters very could never dominate your husband amen like you should not dominate other brothers don't dominate your father when your father says no no that street is bad always be calm and humble that's how sisters present themselves hallelujah amen who else has done something oh there's someone here with a question and they're saying uh god bless you so please i think what do they mean by when you sell your birthright you are like so in page let me open that in page 228 228 paragraph four line five and six one two three four okay let me read the whole paragraph he says when i apologize about for political reasons he saw this bathroom don't matter someone for any reason apart from love don't matter some people marry for political reasons if i marry from this tribe if i marry from that family if i matter you know i will be like this no no don't do that you join up with an organization and you sell you a bathroom you join up you are you join up with an organization and you serve your birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their birthright and when you sell your birthright you are just like essa hallelujah you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there's only one thing you can do that is come out of my people and stop partaking over sins hallelujah because by this organization this denomination sister please i don't know if you're holding the message or not but those organizations which were born in the denominations they believe that if you are a member of their church please listen to me if you are a member of their church you are going to heaven and if you live you are going to hear that's what they believe and there are the members of those churches don't leave those memberships they have to get stuck in those memberships because they believe it's their ticket to heaven they see the father i have touched membership i'm going to heaven but let me tell you this message is different and the people who do those things they are selling their bathrooms just like even if it doesn't matter where it is whatever even if it is kind of messy charges some messages kind of have that kind of feeling if people are in this church they leave they go to another they have got help that's a spirit of necolationism it's a spirit not of god we are we have learned from this church edge book as we are going progressing with the studies that in in the message in the truth in the true church we are having one church hallelujah one church and which is that church how do we enter that church come on now how do we enter that church let us show ourselves i have a brother here his name is because his father is tea so he's the chili by what but i can be a part of their family by joining and therefore i would be an future member of the of the family but he is a member of the family because his body therefore in the church of jesus christ we are born in it by the way by the power of the word of god amen we must be able to receive the holy ghost that's the same whereby we are seeing the trilogy of our redemption hallelujah we say that there are some people who say if you are not a member of our attack you are going to have that kind of spirit you are saving your path right by doing that kind of thing you have to cover that kind of system we in the message thank god we don't have you know if i say days of the voice fellowship is a church and to give me the names of other churches to the church is a challenge end time evening is a chat come on they are not churches they are fellowships of the same church did you know that yes did you know that yes your friendships are the one one church if i'm a member in this fellowship i'm a member of the other did you read the message if you are excommunicated in days of the west fellowship you can not fellowship anywhere it is not allowed because we are male we are the same church if you are if you can take communion here you can also take communion in another place as long as they believe the message and preach the same message why because we are the members we are all members of the same church what is the church the church is the body of christ hallelujah and the body of christ is big and large it's all over the world not only in uganda therefore all these ones are fellowships some have many people others have small others have more others have medium it doesn't matter what matters is that we are all members of the same church if now one of them if one of that fellowship begins to feel we are there earlier which is right they have also been attacked by that speed of negligence hallelujah my sister who asked that question we that's why they must come out of her because if they begin joining systems and organizations like that saying if you're not a member of an organization you're going to hear that spirit of essa has entered them they have sought their path right you remember what srb that's how sold his birthright to organization he was hungry so you have to organize his stomach the only way to survive it is to come out the best kind of organizations and be a free man for christ we are free men three women we are not controlled by man or creed we are not controlled by what but documents organizations denominations by bishops artificials pastors we are controlled by two things that you know the brother solomon number one you are conjoined by the wrath of god hallelujah number two by the holy ghost hallelujah and the true church of god must have signs and one [Music] anybody with another question yes something you write or a question okay you have to increase your voice say that again sister i learned that good works i think that's quite wonderful not so yes amen that good works are good but they cannot but they come out they come out from a saved life out of the same life if you are if oh yeah this is wonderful god bless you my little sister now listen to this no matter what you do you might wear a longer dress even if it goes sweeping on the ground right you cannot break it a little bit you know you can pray for them that they it can't take you to heaven you can see like an angel you can't even go because of that you didn't know that yes you can go do good things and head up everyone around you and even the poor and even the widows it's just a good religion but it doesn't stop there now the problem is some stop there this is what you see your works are nothing so it doesn't matter what you do you know you see now they are trying to perfect the word of truth what they're saying then is true but then it does not stop there it continues but what do you do say that again sister good works don't save you but but the good works come out of our saved life what you do does not save you but you do what you do because you are saved hallelujah amen when you get what are baptized you get into the water not to be saved by that water but you get into that water because you are saved how do you get saved you get served by the living after salvation you believe to be saved you by faith as you say brother says amen it's not of your words it's the gift of god amen you believe with your ears you hear with your heart you believe with your muscles you confess outward unto salvation that's why you need baptism you need water baptism because you are saved amen amen why did you take a shower why are you taking do you need to take a shower to become a human being so why do you take a shower because you're a human being yes you had a pig so some people who have a spiritual pigs they don't take a shower you know but if you are having a speed of a human being a good human being you don't even need to be filled with whatever you know that you need to take a shower you only need to create a humanity and because you're a human being naturally by nature you have to take a shower right yes you have to cut your beard because you're a human being by nature right so you see the things you do doesn't make you to be a human being but you do that because you are a human being so why do you get baptized you get baptized because you are a believer he doesn't believe that i is baptized so you believe then you get baptized baptism so some people the oneness people they preach that baptism saves us so he said no baptism does not save us baptism only saves us by the answer as being an answer of a good conscience before god hallelujah so why do you dress up along with dress my sister you dress along with dress and you throw away the mini dresses and scars why because you are a believer you've been changed hallelujah where do you throw away all the makeups and every all the characters and everything because you are a believer you're not you're not throwing it away because you want to be saved but you're throwing it right because you have realized who you are you were behaving like a peak but now you're there you're not a pig so after all you're behaving like who you actually are hallelujah so the gospel only removes myself for you to see the gospels only and i open up food to realize who you are and now you don't do some things and you do something only because you're realized that you are we were so never do anything to be saved don't even give your type to become rich like i was saying what's a good but what must only be done out of a heart that has been changed so i only pay my tithe because i arise as a child of god i must appreciate god or what has given me therefore i do it in appreciation to what god has done for me not for me to get but i do it because of who i am you understand hallelujah so my children i do things for them not because i want to entice them and they and they and they bribe them to become my children i do those things for them because they're my children so you see the things you do is because of who you are and the things god does for you is because to him yeah wonderful yes the things god does for you now let me do something good for you so that's why sometimes you may not do anything for you you grow up because even if you don't want god knows you are his child and therefore you must be kidding because you're the game of that little boy who was taken in a prison in a a slave ship and when he reached the other end he realized you know he was a server king so he behaved like a son of a king and the others were like but for him he was seated like a prince behaving like a son of a king and all of a sudden what was this is he behaving a bit different different from the others when they discovered they realized that he's the son of a king from where he came from you see if you are son of a king you behave regardless of the situation around you right yes it never may encourage you it may imprison you but you don't cast god there's some things you cannot do because you are who you are god bless you for that lesson amen amen oh my hallelujah what else do we have anything else yes who has a question all right 241 page 200. 41 right yes okay [Music] yes that's when we read here it is every generation right now every one of us promises is going to be applied to all the bride all through the ages just like in our generation we are promised what the relations have promised what to strain with him on his throne yeah so does it mean that the believers before us shall not reign with him they will reign with him and they will behold the christ the one will start but we will also become first the morningstar they will need the tree of life but we are also we actually already even eating the tree of life that's why the believers of this last generation are more blessed than almost all the others should say because we are pertaining of we already partake of certain things that he never took off did you realize that the entrance to the tree of life is fully open in our generation in that generation it was only a little treat but for us we now have see that's why we say that so give us the words of the song we say that god what's what what's attributes we are manifested to his bride in this last age we have called the revelation of the last prophet's message and we know who we are and what we raised up for praise the lord for the original night the original life the original [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] give [Music] who is [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] our eyes [Music] is [Music] [Applause] [Music] tonight [Applause] [Music] is [Music] oh [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] it is now how they do it they help us to raise up and come back to this house to pick up their bodies [Music] then we are caught up into the air to do it so [Music] amen do we have anybody question any yes say that again yes all these were gentiles only in some church ages there were some jews and like in the ephesians there was jews there um like the other generations yeah they will be there they are actually almost every generation will have all races of people all types of people including those who are called jews it doesn't matter if they receive christ and they die they will resurrect among the bride of music of this age it doesn't really matter who they are even right now they speak to you that there is a church i knew of two of this message in israel not all the jews are going to be among the 144 yes so but but we know that when god is dealing with the jews he deals with them as a nation but there are those isolated cases of the israelites that will be saved and be among the bride for example will paul be among the right was he a jew or agenda paul was a jew but was a citizen of wrong so that's how he becomes wrong but he was from the tribe of benjamin yes and uh peter peter peter you don't even have any question at all right would it be among the jewels the weather for the four thousand or will he be among us is he part of the bride yes yes and these are our pentecostal fathers do you know that allah yes sir they are and uh this message is to restore us back to the fate of our pentecostals so yes they they will be there among the bride as long as they were allotted to be among the bride and those who are going to be among the jews the 154th they will also be there so yes are we that other questions yes [Music] about it's about being served it's about being a servant yes amen that is a very good lesson some people just want to be served may god help us always want to be servants hallelujah right and you remember i told you that they say well done my good and friendful servant are you to enjoy your bed lord now you wonder if you have never been a servant even you know if you are humbling yourself to greet someone that someone also must humble themselves to greet you but if they don't have themselves to greet you don't say you you are yourself you know you are servant so if every one of you knows you are silence all of us will be servants right yes wait until we take the lovely supper and i think we should do it before we you guys go back to school you see we have to wash one another's feet suffer from one another how can you the one who is above [Music] our attribution is jesus christ even our pastor jesus christ hallelujah he is the one who is above everyone the rest of us from one another hallelujah amen amen is huh go ahead and ask the question church we have yes from here yes that's true that's a very good question all right and i'm not done with that series so i hope you your question will still get answered in the coming menu on this sunday maybe another i don't know just stay tuned right but to answer you briefly i want to say this three more agents yes we are all free model agents knowing and believing that no one makes our decisions but when a child like elizabeth for example i give you this example is she's still a child just a right to do what she wants to be right but not yet god has blessed me in her life at such a time as this to guide her by law to control her by law until such an age that is called the age of accountability even when this guy does something wrong the neighbor cannot beat her or the neighbor cannot take her to prison they never will come to me the neighbor will not penalize that they'll ever analyze me you understand why because i am responsible so now how can i be responsible for our decision or choice because our choice has not yet grown to a time whereby it can be independent therefore god will not judge that would judge me for even for for not doing my job to train her that's why the bible says i train up a child when the child is young so that when that child grows up he will stay in the things you trained him in because when he grows up you do not have authority over the child anymore in the same spiritually speaking we are children of god so when we are in the church we are told what to do and what what we do how who tells us god through the preachers this and that unless sometimes the pastor preacher can preach something that is really quite hard for you ah how can they tell you to pray every day how can they do that why do that because you are still a child spiritual you don't have the holy ghost to you to the law yes do what a person say but eventually time is coming when you will know what you want when i go to mature when you receive the workouts when you receive the one of us you tell yourself one now i don't need to be now controlled by the law anymore because you you already have the law of god in your heart to control you and tell you what i might answer your question if the certain point is not yet answered wait until you get yeah to answer all right god bless you okay is there any more questions yes [Music] yes the parent is responsible whether they are believers or not believers and also i'll tell you this to treat a child a good character or morals does not need you to be a believer to begin with you know for a parent i used to when i did not grow up and i believe a message believers woman but our father her father never allowed my sister to wear a trouser she never did wear it our father never allowed us to have to put on the lipstick we are not in the believers home right our father never allowed us to be in groups when you know you go to school then you get a bible group you know don't be those groups that's bad and he was not a messenger believer but by virtue of the fact that he knows that those groups are going to cause us to go into alcoholism to go into prostitution to go into you know drugs abuse and things like that he would tell us don't get those groups and zero you understand by seven or by six of you should be at home all of us know it is the law of atlanta so we keep it whether is there or not there now there is no parent who is going to give an excuse before god for not raising their children right and that also goes to each of you because you are potentially parents all of you yes you must raise you have to say that that child do what she wants when she grows you will know what is right you are risking that child does not know what is right and even when should we should never know it so you have to tell that time what is right now when she grows there are families for example that are a you as a man who is prepared to marry in about five to ten years amen you are you have some families you can't marry from and you have some families you can marry from now you will still be the same one even if you do not believe the message also you see so it's not because it's an evil message i was very no you would not that family those people are thieves you understand why because their parents never trained their children it began from sugar selling sugar stealing things from the neighbors and they treat their parents who are not training them don't do that they're like ah my child even when someone comes at home but i mean you see they just eat things from their neighborhood i cannot do anything now they just do it i don't know they're right there further you know not when the child grows you're going to stay still in the ceiling and you'll become a robber now they know what you see they become children you understand their children that their families where they are all the new prostitution you find that the man was going here with many women also the child sees that and we also get and when they get the father will not be able to correct the child because they know that they are doing the same thing saying keep quiet and then the child will grow up and they also become prosecute you understand so you see things like that it they said charity begins at oh therefore there are some families a wise man cannot marry foreign [Music] if i matter there there there is a very clear sign that i may have a part b of what is there in my own you understand so friends that's what it all means it is a hundred percent god the parents are responsible for 100 on training their children and to ensure they do train them to do what is right because if they do not train them they will be responsible for their life you see that's why when you're still young and your father mother beats you with the road you hate them with me but when you grow up the mommy and daddy you even begin loving them more you understand and there are some children when they grow they realize that this point in my life they support my life because they remember you know that money i want i want to to buy this thing it's okay my baby you back i want that on your body ah you can't even have i just bought something for you just let that be enough for you what are you he's sitting in a child you're not even training a child to appreciate what they have but you're spreading them with the toys here and there you understand that child will grow without appreciating life without knowing the value of life so integrity you know you know it's taught when you're still young you understand appreciating the value of life you stole when you're still young work is taught when you're still yeah if your mom will tell you sweep and they leave you you will grow up like that even when you go your boss will tell you do this he will chase you out from the job and you'll be jobless who's always responsible you are not taught where you are so you cannot you can sort of talk about men anyways that's it any more questions someone with something that they want to share with us [Music] all right so i can see that we are all good uh had a wonderful time our
