[53:47] Heat.
[53:49] Heat.
[53:51] [Music]
[53:59] Heat. Yeah. Heat.
[54:03] [Music]
[54:16] Hallelujah. Oh, thank you
[54:19] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Oh,
[54:23] hallelujah.
[54:25] Hallelujah. Amen. The Lord bless each
[54:28] and every one of
[54:30] you. Amen.
[54:33] I'd like us to turn to the word tonight.
[54:40] We just want to continue with the Sunday
[54:42] service, Sunday sermon that we were
[54:45] dealing
[54:48] with dity tabernacord in
[54:55] man. Amen.
[54:58] Isn't he wonderful?
[55:01] Amen. I I think we finished off when we
[55:03] were talking about uh Mary.
[55:09] and how she was highly favored.
[55:13] Amen. And uh we we talked about the
[55:17] angel coming to
[55:20] Mary. Uh but for a little rehearsal we
[55:23] can
[55:24] read Luke chapter 4 chapter 2 once
[55:32] again vers
[55:52] Eight. I believe everybody's
[55:57] there. If you're there, say
[56:00] amen. Yeah. And there were in the same
[56:05] country shepherds abiding in the field,
[56:08] keeping watch over their flock by
[56:10] night. And and lo, the angel of the Lord
[56:14] came upon them, and the glory of the
[56:18] Lord shone around about them, and they
[56:20] were so afraid. And the angel said unto
[56:23] them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you
[56:26] good tidings of great joy, which shall
[56:29] be to all people. For unto you is born
[56:32] this day in the city of David, a Savior,
[56:35] which is Christ the Lord." And this
[56:37] shall be a sign unto you, ye shall find
[56:39] a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes,
[56:42] lying in a manger. And suddenly there
[56:44] was with the angel a multitude of the
[56:48] heavenly host praising God and saying,
[56:51] "Glory to God in the highest and and on
[56:54] the and on earth peace, good will toward
[56:57] men." And it came to pass as the angel
[56:59] were go as the angels were gone away
[57:01] from them into heaven, the shepherd said
[57:04] one to another, "Let us now go even unto
[57:07] Bethlehem and see this thing which is
[57:09] come to pass, which the Lord has made
[57:11] known unto us." And they came with hest
[57:14] and found Mary and Joseph and the babe
[57:17] lying in a manger. And when they had
[57:19] seen it, they made known abroad the
[57:21] saying which was told them concerning
[57:23] this child. And all they that had it
[57:25] wondered at those things which were told
[57:27] them by the shepherds. But Mary kept all
[57:30] these things and pondered them in her
[57:32] heart. And the shepherds returned
[57:33] glorifying and praising God for all the
[57:36] things which they had heard and seen as
[57:38] it was told unto them. May the Lord
[57:41] bless you. You may be seated.
[57:45] This evening we are also speaking to
[57:47] Evening Light Bright
[57:48] [Music]
[57:50] Tabernacle. I'd like to greet the saints
[57:52] on Zoom
[57:54] tonight. May the Lord bless you
[57:57] all. And to the saints here, this will
[57:59] be part two of what we talked
[58:02] about. And so because of the Zoom, we'll
[58:05] just do um um one hour. So we're trying
[58:08] to make it brief.
[58:12] So just pray for me will you?
[58:16] Amen. So the we talk we are talking
[58:18] about the subject of dity tabernacle in
[58:23] man and um you know the reason why I
[58:26] read this scripture told you on
[58:30] Sunday is because you know it's
[58:32] unfolding the plan of God which he had
[58:34] purposed in him before the foundation of
[58:36] the world.
[58:39] [Music]
[58:41] And I showed you that the devil usually
[58:43] has a
[58:46] plan. And we we read talked about
[58:48] scriptures where in the book of
[58:50] revelation it speaks about the falling
[58:52] of the devil on
[58:56] earth. He was defeated in heaven and he
[59:00] came down to the earth. So we are
[59:02] fighting a defeated
[59:05] devil. Our enemy is defeated.
[59:09] So if if you have
[59:11] fever or if you have any any sickness or
[59:15] you have any problem in a
[59:17] mountain, you know that is an enemy. It
[59:20] seems a
[59:22] temptation. It's an enemy. The flesh is
[59:26] an enemy to you. But you see, it's a
[59:28] defeated
[59:30] enemy. We are not fighting an enemy that
[59:33] we think will be defeated.
[59:37] He came down to earth as a defeated
[59:40] devil and he remains as
[59:43] such. Amen. But when he came down, I
[59:47] would think being a creature of
[59:50] God, he was created to be
[59:52] [Music]
[59:54] perfect. He was created to be
[59:57] perfect. You know the Bible to be
[59:59] perfect. Be perfect.
[1:00:03] Yes. That's what the Bible says. He was
[1:00:05] created. He was perfect
[1:00:09] until iniquity was found in
[1:00:13] him. So you know those are kind of
[1:00:16] things that we may not completely
[1:00:19] understand because someone may ask if
[1:00:21] the devil was created
[1:00:24] perfect and for your information he was
[1:00:26] not the
[1:00:28] devil. He was called
[1:00:32] Lucifer because all angels are
[1:00:35] perfect. They are meant to be
[1:00:37] perfect. That's why when an angel sins
[1:00:39] he cannot be forgiven.
[1:00:42] There is no forgiveness for for angels
[1:00:47] sinners just like there is no
[1:00:49] forgiveness for serpent
[1:00:52] seed because they are already
[1:00:56] sinners. Okay, I want you to hold
[1:00:59] this. You see the serpent seed will see
[1:01:03] serpent seed does not
[1:01:05] sin but serpent seed is a
[1:01:09] sinner. You are a sinner not because you
[1:01:11] have
[1:01:13] sinned. You are a sinner because you
[1:01:16] have committed
[1:01:19] sin. You are not meant to
[1:01:21] sin. Are you following me now? But to
[1:01:25] them they are sinners not because they
[1:01:28] committed
[1:01:29] sin but they are sinners to begin
[1:01:34] with. But you know Jesus can only
[1:01:38] forgive those who committed
[1:01:41] sin. They did something which was bad
[1:01:45] that they were not supposed to
[1:01:47] do. They were not meant to do
[1:01:50] it. They were meant to be
[1:01:53] perfect. They were never
[1:01:56] sinners. That's why I am not a
[1:01:59] sinner. I am a child of God.
[1:02:03] But you see when I sinned, he forgave my
[1:02:06] sin. Why did he forgive my
[1:02:09] sin? Because I was in him before the
[1:02:12] foundation of the
[1:02:15] world. And then he says, he that is born
[1:02:17] of
[1:02:19] God cannot commit
[1:02:22] sin because his seed remains in
[1:02:27] him. Praise the name of the Lord. So we
[1:02:30] are not judged.
[1:02:32] because we are not
[1:02:39] sinners. Okay, he missed there. You
[1:02:43] know, we we are not
[1:02:45] judged because we cannot be judged
[1:02:48] already because we are not
[1:02:50] sinners. You
[1:02:53] understand? We are not sinners. We are
[1:02:56] born to
[1:02:57] believe. I am born to believe. I cannot
[1:03:00] unbelieve the
[1:03:01] word. I am a believer even when
[1:03:05] sometimes wrong things happen in my
[1:03:08] life. I just did not mean to do
[1:03:11] that. But in my heart, I am born to be a
[1:03:17] believer. But you
[1:03:19] see that is a seed of
[1:03:22] God. The seed remains a
[1:03:26] seed. But angels, they are born also to
[1:03:29] be
[1:03:31] perfect. But you see, that's why when
[1:03:33] angels
[1:03:34] sin, they cannot be redeemed
[1:03:39] back. Because Jesus did not die for
[1:03:44] angels. Jesus died for Adam's
[1:03:49] race. He died, Amen. for for human
[1:03:52] beings. Those who were his
[1:03:55] seed, those who were in him before the
[1:03:58] foundation of the
[1:03:59] world, those are the ones who he died
[1:04:02] for. Therefore, when they sin, he
[1:04:05] redeems them. Are you following me? But
[1:04:08] angels cannot be
[1:04:10] redeemed. And Lucifer is one of them.
[1:04:14] When he
[1:04:15] sinned, iniquity was found in
[1:04:18] him. He cannot, you could not be
[1:04:20] redeemed. But all the gifts he
[1:04:23] had, he remained with them. He remained
[1:04:27] with the singing. He remained with the
[1:04:29] beauty. He remained with the powers. He
[1:04:32] remained with the
[1:04:33] anointings. But he did not continue to
[1:04:36] be who
[1:04:39] he became a
[1:04:42] devil. A
[1:04:44] dragon. Bible calls him a dragon. that
[1:04:47] old
[1:04:48] serpent, the devil, a deceiver, the
[1:04:52] father of
[1:04:54] lies. But we see he had a plan. He
[1:04:58] thought he will ascend above the stars
[1:05:00] of God, become
[1:05:02] God. But when he failed at that, he
[1:05:06] said, "Okay, I'll go down to the human
[1:05:07] race. That's my plan B and take over in
[1:05:11] the human race.
[1:05:13] If I can't take over, I'll confuse the
[1:05:16] human race and I will rule over
[1:05:18] them. And right now, he's ruling over
[1:05:20] the world.
[1:05:23] You see, the devil thinks he's ruling
[1:05:24] over the
[1:05:25] world. But I can I can tell you this.
[1:05:28] There are those the devil cannot rule
[1:05:34] over. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:05:37] the devil cannot rule over.
[1:05:40] They are meant to be
[1:05:43] perfect. They are meant to be
[1:05:46] deity tabernacled in
[1:05:50] man. Amen. If I cannot do that, the
[1:05:54] devil
[1:05:55] thought, I will steal, I will kill, and
[1:05:57] I will destroy the human
[1:06:00] race. And I showed you that that was the
[1:06:02] plan of Satan.
[1:06:05] But you see where the devil has
[1:06:07] multitude of
[1:06:09] plans. God has one
[1:06:11] plan. By the way, there is one thing
[1:06:13] that comforts
[1:06:15] me. Amen. To know to know that when God
[1:06:20] thought of
[1:06:22] me, whatever he thought of me, he cannot
[1:06:26] think
[1:06:27] another. He cannot change his
[1:06:29] mind. So no matter how much you have
[1:06:32] done at his body in his life,
[1:06:36] God did not change his mind about
[1:06:39] you. That is why it is pride. If you
[1:06:44] fall away and you feel that God cannot
[1:06:46] restore you
[1:06:51] back, if you're a child of God and and
[1:06:54] you feel like a sinner and the word of
[1:06:57] God is
[1:06:58] preached, as a child of God, you must
[1:07:01] accept. You must accept your freedom.
[1:07:03] You must accept the word of
[1:07:05] God. If God says you are good and you're
[1:07:08] not
[1:07:08] bad, you cannot say
[1:07:11] no. You don't know what you're talking
[1:07:12] about, not for someone else, let me tell
[1:07:16] it is for
[1:07:17] you. It is pride for you not to accept
[1:07:21] the pattern given to
[1:07:23] you. Amen. Whatever God thought of
[1:07:27] me can never change it. He will never
[1:07:31] change it because his first thought is
[1:07:34] as perfect as he is.
[1:07:39] Amen. And God had a plan. And he talked
[1:07:42] about his plan as a plan which was a
[1:07:45] perfect
[1:07:48] plan. It was a winning
[1:07:51] plan. No
[1:07:53] angel. No man knew it. It was a plan
[1:07:57] which was top secret.
[1:08:00] It was hidden
[1:08:01] away. You know when Adam and Eve was
[1:08:04] sinning in the garden of
[1:08:06] Eden the angels tried to go and help the
[1:08:10] situation and many people ask a
[1:08:13] question. If God is a loving
[1:08:15] God why didn't he hinder Satan from
[1:08:18] tempting Eve
[1:08:22] and the answer is simple. Because God
[1:08:25] had a
[1:08:26] plan and the plan he had then is the
[1:08:29] plan he has now. If God allows you to be
[1:08:32] found in any
[1:08:34] situation, it is because he has a
[1:08:37] plan. We must learn to be to be to
[1:08:40] behave like
[1:08:42] believers. Let us learn to trust
[1:08:44] God. In good situations, bad situations.
[1:08:48] Even when you are confused and you are
[1:08:51] helpless, God has a plan. Even when you
[1:08:55] think you have failed
[1:08:57] yourself, failed your parents, failed
[1:09:00] your pastor, failed everyone. God has a
[1:09:05] plan. Many times when I feel I've failed
[1:09:08] myself. But you know, you set out
[1:09:10] ambitions. You say, "I want to do this,
[1:09:12] this, this, and
[1:09:14] this." I remember the scripture. The
[1:09:17] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:09:19] of the Lord.
[1:09:22] David said, "Even though I walk through
[1:09:23] the valley of the shadow man, I fear
[1:09:27] not." There is nothing goes wrong in a a
[1:09:30] life of a
[1:09:33] believer. Am I preaching to someone? In
[1:09:36] a life of a believer, everything is
[1:09:40] perfect. Everything is good.
[1:09:44] That's why the Bible says all things
[1:09:50] all
[1:09:52] together that love
[1:09:54] God that are
[1:09:56] called
[1:09:58] according to his
[1:10:01] purpose. I am not God according to my
[1:10:05] purpose. God according to his
[1:10:07] purpose and I believe I'm a child of
[1:10:10] God. All the good, all the bad works for
[1:10:16] good. And God has a plan for
[1:10:20] me. It's called Alpha and Omega
[1:10:24] Plan. Omega. He kept it
[1:10:28] hidden. You know this plan. No angel
[1:10:31] knew it. He left Adam and Eve to sin.
[1:10:36] He left them to fall away because he had
[1:10:38] a plan to come and redeem them. Amen. I
[1:10:43] wanted to think about it. How would he
[1:10:45] have been called a
[1:10:47] redeemer if he did not redeem
[1:10:49] anybody? How would he have been called a
[1:10:52] savior if he did not save anybody? So he
[1:10:56] told the angel Gabriel and all the other
[1:10:59] angels, don't go. They couldn't
[1:11:02] understand. Why would we go to do the
[1:11:05] work we are made to
[1:11:06] do? Because there is something I want to
[1:11:10] be. There is something I want to
[1:11:13] become. I cannot become it. If my son
[1:11:17] does not fall away, he has to fall away
[1:11:21] so I can come and
[1:11:23] say where are you? And when he comes,
[1:11:27] then I'll get a C
[1:11:29] of them to eat. Then I'll be a redeemer.
[1:11:34] But that was only
[1:11:37] potentially. That was just the
[1:11:40] beginning. The devil did not
[1:11:42] understand co of skin. This is all you
[1:11:46] can do. But that was the
[1:11:49] beginning. When God is beginning his
[1:11:51] work at
[1:11:53] you, you may not see
[1:11:56] it. Others may not see it, but a
[1:11:59] believer is made to believe.
[1:12:03] Let us always believe in the plan of
[1:12:06] God for our
[1:12:08] life. Tell your neighbor, God has a
[1:12:12] plan. Hallelujah. God told all the
[1:12:16] angels. Step
[1:12:18] aside. Step aside. It looks like the
[1:12:21] devil is
[1:12:23] winning. But God had a plan.
[1:12:26] And on Sunday we wanted to talk about uh
[1:12:29] we we started trying to talk about the
[1:12:31] execution of the
[1:12:36] plan. I will not go repeat what we
[1:12:39] talked about on
[1:12:41] Sunday but I want to go down to the
[1:12:43] execution of the
[1:12:46] plan. Luke 1
[1:12:50] 28 Luke 1
[1:12:56] 28 And the angel came in unto her and
[1:13:00] said, "Hail, thou art highly favored.
[1:13:02] The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou
[1:13:04] among
[1:13:05] women." Talking of
[1:13:14] Mary. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The angel
[1:13:17] came in unto her and said, "Hail, thou
[1:13:20] art highly
[1:13:22] favored. Thou art highly
[1:13:25] favored." I want us to see
[1:13:28] something. Why would the angel
[1:13:30] come and speak this
[1:13:33] word? Because we are looking at
[1:13:36] something that was hidden for
[1:13:40] ages. Something that was hidden for
[1:13:42] thousands of years.
[1:13:47] No angel in heaven knew. No man on
[1:13:50] earth. It was hidden. It was kept
[1:13:53] away. But the moment it was going to be
[1:13:58] executed, God called one
[1:14:01] angel and his name is Gabriel. The one
[1:14:04] who sends the
[1:14:06] message. The one who sends the tidings
[1:14:09] from the presence of
[1:14:10] God. He called him. He said, "Gabriel,
[1:14:13] it is
[1:14:15] time." Gabriel
[1:14:17] look what it is time for that top secret
[1:14:23] plan to be
[1:14:25] unveiled. It is time. The season has
[1:14:29] arrived. Let me tell you, brethren, many
[1:14:32] times you may have questions about
[1:14:34] tomorrow, about your
[1:14:37] life. Keep the faith.
[1:14:41] Do not lose faith because there is
[1:14:44] always a time. There is always a season
[1:14:48] for the plan of God to
[1:14:52] unfold. Amen. And the angel said what?
[1:14:56] He said, "Now go to the earth." You
[1:14:59] remember because God had already said it
[1:15:00] in the book of
[1:15:02] Genesis. You know when he when he gave
[1:15:04] that prophecy if you will call
[1:15:07] it and I will put an en between thee and
[1:15:09] the woman.
[1:15:11] and between thy seed and their
[1:15:13] seed, he shall bruise thy
[1:15:16] hair, and thou shall bruise his
[1:15:19] head. So he's talking about the seed of
[1:15:21] the
[1:15:22] woman, the seed of a woman is a
[1:15:26] child who is born by a
[1:15:29] woman without the help of a
[1:15:33] man, without man giving the woman
[1:15:36] seed, it will be the seed of the woman.
[1:15:40] There's only one that was that
[1:15:42] way. That was
[1:15:45] Jesus. Jesus is the seed of the
[1:15:48] woman. But before that, no one knew.
[1:15:52] When it was spoken by
[1:15:54] God, it was not
[1:15:56] understood. It was still a
[1:15:59] secret. But when the angel came, the
[1:16:03] angel came to a
[1:16:05] woman. The angel did not come to someone
[1:16:07] educated.
[1:16:09] The angel did not come to a
[1:16:11] theologian. The angel did not come to
[1:16:14] someone with DD or
[1:16:17] LLD. That's all good, but that's not the
[1:16:21] qualification of
[1:16:24] revelation. It's not about what you
[1:16:29] have or what qualifies
[1:16:34] you. It's about who you are. Glory.
[1:16:38] Amen. Amen. I want you to understand
[1:16:41] that in this world, God does not choose
[1:16:44] everybody.
[1:16:48] There are those who are favored.
[1:16:53] Not everyone is
[1:16:54] bride. Think about it. Many are called,
[1:16:58] but few are chosen. From the few, I am
[1:17:04] one of them. You are one of them.
[1:17:08] It is a
[1:17:10] privilege. Hallelujah.
[1:17:13] And there was a promise that a virgin
[1:17:16] shall
[1:17:17] conceive and bring forth a
[1:17:20] son. And it was it it it sounded as if
[1:17:24] it is something that is no longer a
[1:17:28] secret when Isaiah prophesied
[1:17:31] it. But you see, it was still a hidden
[1:17:35] secret.
[1:17:37] until the revelation of that
[1:17:40] secret. How does God reveal
[1:17:43] it? By manifesting
[1:17:45] [Music]
[1:17:47] it. Are you following me now? And the
[1:17:50] angel came and said, "Hail Mary, thou at
[1:17:53] highly
[1:17:54] favor. The Lord is with thee. Blessed
[1:17:57] art thou among
[1:17:58] women. The secret which was hidden from
[1:18:02] all ages from all generations before it
[1:18:06] was going to be revealed to this little
[1:18:08] woman. And that's why the angel said,
[1:18:10] "You are highly
[1:18:12] favored. The mystery of
[1:18:15] God, the mystery of
[1:18:17] God coming
[1:18:20] down, tabernacling among
[1:18:23] men was going to be revealed.
[1:18:27] Hallelujah. And the first one to know
[1:18:30] was Mary. That's why she was highly
[1:18:34] favored. Not everybody knows the mystery
[1:18:36] of
[1:18:37] God, but you know the mystery of God.
[1:18:40] And you are highly
[1:18:41] favored. Can you shout, I am highly
[1:18:46] favored. When it was time for God to now
[1:18:48] execute his
[1:18:50] plan, the first one to know was me.
[1:18:54] The second one was the
[1:18:56] shepherd. The things these humble people
[1:18:59] knew. Even the kings did not
[1:19:02] know. These were privileged
[1:19:06] people. The things you know, not even
[1:19:10] the presidents
[1:19:12] know, not even the kings know, not even
[1:19:15] the educated
[1:19:16] know. You are privileged. We are
[1:19:20] privileged. Thank God for the ending
[1:19:22] message.
[1:19:24] Hallelujah. Amen. We are privileged.
[1:19:27] The things we know, not even the kings
[1:19:30] know. We are privileged. Tell your
[1:19:33] neighbor, you're
[1:19:35] privileged. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:19:37] Amen. I am privileged. He says, look at
[1:19:41] it this way. Oh, too many read the Bible
[1:19:44] where it says Acts
[1:19:48] 238. Repent and be baptized every one of
[1:19:51] you in the name of Jesus Christ.
[1:19:54] for the remission of sins and he shall
[1:19:56] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and
[1:19:59] just they just pass right
[1:20:01] now. They don't see it. If they saw it
[1:20:05] by getting in the spirit, they would
[1:20:08] have known that it if they want to
[1:20:10] receive the Holy
[1:20:13] Spirit, they need to repent and be
[1:20:17] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:20:19] And then God would be duty bound.
[1:20:22] to fulfill his word by filling them with
[1:20:26] the Holy Spirit. They never get in the
[1:20:29] spirit or it would have to happen to
[1:20:32] them exactly as the word
[1:20:36] says. And then he says,
[1:20:39] "Pray to God for a revelation by his
[1:20:44] spirit." Why many are baptized and they
[1:20:48] don't have the Holy Spirit? because they
[1:20:51] don't have
[1:20:52] revelation. Brethren, do you see the
[1:20:54] importance of
[1:20:56] revelation? When it is revealed to you
[1:20:59] personally, it will happen as he has
[1:21:02] said. And the angel said unto her, "Fear
[1:21:06] not Mary, for thou has found favor with
[1:21:09] God. And behold, thou shalt conceive in
[1:21:11] thy
[1:21:12] womb, and bring forth a son, and shall
[1:21:16] call his name Jesus. He shall be great
[1:21:19] and and and and shall be called the son
[1:21:21] of the
[1:21:22] highest. And the Lord God shall give
[1:21:24] unto him the throne of his father
[1:21:27] David, and he shall reign over the house
[1:21:30] of
[1:21:31] Judah forever, and of his kingdom there
[1:21:34] shall
[1:21:35] be. Then said Mary unto him, How shall
[1:21:39] this be? Seeing I know not a man. And
[1:21:43] the angel said unto Peter, "The Holy
[1:21:46] Ghost shall come upon thee, and the
[1:21:49] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:21:53] thee. Therefore also that holy
[1:21:56] thing which shall be born of
[1:21:59] thee, shall be
[1:22:02] called the son of
[1:22:06] God." Hallelujah. By the way, let me
[1:22:09] pause a moment to tell you.
[1:22:11] Do you realize nothing could stop
[1:22:15] this? Amen. It was the season for it to
[1:22:19] be
[1:22:20] fulfilled. God had already seen
[1:22:23] it. God had already said
[1:22:26] it. Right? In
[1:22:28] Genesis, he had prophesied about the
[1:22:30] seed of the
[1:22:32] world. The prophets Isaiah and others,
[1:22:35] they saw the same thing. They prophesied
[1:22:38] about it. And now it was the time for it
[1:22:43] to
[1:22:44] happen. It was the time for it to be
[1:22:47] fulfilled and nothing could stop
[1:22:50] it. The devil could not stop it. Was the
[1:22:54] devil alive? Yes. He was alive in hell,
[1:22:59] but he could not stop
[1:23:00] it. It was the
[1:23:03] time for God to be tabernacled in man.
[1:23:10] Do you know? I don't honestly I don't
[1:23:13] know if the angel
[1:23:16] Gabriel actually knew what he was
[1:23:18] talking
[1:23:19] about. God
[1:23:21] himself was going to come
[1:23:26] down in human
[1:23:30] flesh. That was what was
[1:23:33] prophesied. It was time for it to
[1:23:35] happen. No one could stop it.
[1:23:38] No man could stop him. No angel could
[1:23:40] stop him. Even if Joseph
[1:23:43] refused, he could not stop him. All the
[1:23:47] church, they could not stop him. You
[1:23:50] know, maybe there was at the
[1:23:52] time for disease who had their
[1:23:56] virgins because they were reading the
[1:23:58] same
[1:23:59] scripture but they had no
[1:24:01] revelation. Maybe they also had
[1:24:04] virgin and they had a
[1:24:06] program, church
[1:24:08] program of virgin because the
[1:24:12] scripture was saying a virgin shall
[1:24:16] conceive and bring forth a son.
[1:24:20] So this was a prophecy by one of their
[1:24:25] prophets. Maybe they had a ministry of
[1:24:29] virgin and they they had a place they
[1:24:31] were keeping
[1:24:33] them and they would provide everything
[1:24:35] they wanted. They will not allow any
[1:24:38] money
[1:24:39] that those are virgins. They are kept
[1:24:44] for the sake of the Holy Spirit
[1:24:46] overshadowing
[1:24:48] them. God will come and choose
[1:24:51] one. But you know God is the way he does
[1:24:54] things.
[1:24:57] He passes all those who think they are
[1:25:03] organized and he go to the
[1:25:07] disorganized. Someone told me one day.
[1:25:10] How do you think you are the bride of
[1:25:14] Christ? Where is your
[1:25:16] headquarters? Who is your
[1:25:19] archbishop? How are your churches
[1:25:22] structured? And I told him, brother, Our
[1:25:26] headquarters is in
[1:25:28] heaven. Our bishop is Jesus
[1:25:31] Christ. We are structured according to
[1:25:33] the Holy
[1:25:35] Ghost. And the Bible, he said you are
[1:25:39] disorganized. How can you even correct
[1:25:42] your
[1:25:43] preachers? Because you are
[1:25:45] disorganized and they think they are the
[1:25:48] true because they have the
[1:25:52] systems. Brethren, God bypasses all
[1:25:56] that. God doesn't look at the
[1:25:59] systems and we bring it
[1:26:01] down even to you as an individual. It is
[1:26:05] good to go to school. It is going is
[1:26:08] good to get those
[1:26:10] accolades then you'll get good job. Can
[1:26:13] we say amen? Can we say amen? But let me
[1:26:16] also say amen. Don't call me a
[1:26:20] fanatic. Even if you're
[1:26:22] disorganized and you have no
[1:26:25] education and you have no job, God is
[1:26:29] able to call your name, God is able to
[1:26:33] organize something out of
[1:26:36] nothing and build you and make you
[1:26:40] responsible. Let me tell you, the most
[1:26:42] responsible
[1:26:44] people and the believers of the
[1:26:48] word. That's why let the world take
[1:26:52] everything. Don't let them ever take
[1:26:54] Christ from
[1:26:56] you. Amen. Because this organizes
[1:27:02] us. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I want to
[1:27:07] have an education. I want to have the
[1:27:09] degree. I want to have the master. I
[1:27:12] want to have the
[1:27:13] PhD. I want to have Christ.
[1:27:17] [Applause]
[1:27:19] Yes sir. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Have
[1:27:21] that and then you can have everything
[1:27:23] else.
[1:27:26] Praise the name of the Lord. If I passed
[1:27:29] a
[1:27:30] virgin and he came to one who was
[1:27:34] engaged. He even came to the one who was
[1:27:38] engaged because because he wanted to
[1:27:42] confuse those who thought they
[1:27:44] know.
[1:27:46] According to them, this one did not
[1:27:49] qualify because she already had love
[1:27:54] feeling for somebody else. But God came
[1:27:57] to her because she
[1:28:00] qualified. How did she qualify? She had
[1:28:03] a heart to
[1:28:05] believe. She had a heart to receive the
[1:28:08] word. Let your heart always be receive
[1:28:11] the
[1:28:13] word. When the word of God is preached
[1:28:16] to
[1:28:17] you, God will harden your
[1:28:19] heart. Release your
[1:28:22] heart to minister to
[1:28:26] you. Amen. Praise the name of the
[1:28:29] Lord and the Holy He says, "How shall
[1:28:31] these things be?" He said, "Don't you
[1:28:33] worry, Mary. The Holy Ghost shall come
[1:28:36] upon you. The power of the highest shall
[1:28:39] overshadow." Amen. And who was Jesus?
[1:28:44] Without
[1:28:45] controversy, great is the mystery of
[1:28:48] godliness. God was made
[1:28:51] manifest in the
[1:28:53] flesh. Amen. Amen. Justified in the
[1:28:57] spirit, seen of angels, preached unto
[1:29:00] the
[1:29:01] Gentiles, lived on in the world, and
[1:29:05] received up into
[1:29:07] glory. Who? God. Not the second
[1:29:12] person. But God, God was manifest in
[1:29:15] flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of
[1:29:19] angels, preached unto the Gentiles,
[1:29:23] believed on in the world. Who do we
[1:29:26] preach? Jesus. Who do we believe
[1:29:30] on as our
[1:29:32] savior? Jesus.
[1:29:36] Who came in flesh? What is his name?
[1:29:39] Jesus. But the Bible say that was not
[1:29:43] just
[1:29:44] Jesus. That was God
[1:29:47] himself. The creator of heaven and
[1:29:49] earth. John 8
[1:29:52] 5:58. Jesus said unto them, "Verily,
[1:29:55] verily, I say unto
[1:29:56] you, before Abraham
[1:29:59] was, I
[1:30:01] am." Before Abraham
[1:30:04] was, I I
[1:30:07] am. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. What does
[1:30:10] that mean? Hebrews
[1:30:12] 138 Jesus is the same yesterday, today
[1:30:17] and
[1:30:18] forever. He did not say I was. He said I
[1:30:23] am present
[1:30:29] continuous before even Abraham was. I am
[1:30:34] meaning I am before
[1:30:36] Abraham. I am during
[1:30:38] Abraham. I am after
[1:30:41] Abraham. I am even right now. I am even
[1:30:44] after now. I am even
[1:30:49] now. And his name is
[1:30:52] Jesus. Who was it? It was God in
[1:30:57] flesh. He was 100%
[1:31:01] God. He was born the
[1:31:03] Christ. He is the resurrection and the
[1:31:06] life.
[1:31:07] He is alpha and omega. Alpha and omega.
[1:31:09] He's the creator of all things. The
[1:31:11] world was made by him. Amen. He lost
[1:31:15] from the dead. Who was it? 100%
[1:31:20] God without
[1:31:22] controvers without
[1:31:25] doubt. God was
[1:31:28] made. Who was Jesus? Jesus was
[1:31:32] God. Can you say Jesus is God?
[1:31:36] 100%
[1:31:37] sure. But what confuses
[1:31:40] them is the same God who who was in
[1:31:45] him. The one we called
[1:31:48] Jesus. 100%
[1:31:51] God. He was also 100%
[1:31:56] man. Are you confused?
[1:32:00] He had
[1:32:01] flesh and blood. That was not
[1:32:05] God. That was not
[1:32:09] God. He cried. That was not
[1:32:13] God. God
[1:32:15] crying. That was not God. He was
[1:32:19] tempted. The Bible says with all manner
[1:32:22] of
[1:32:24] temptations even as we are tempted.
[1:32:27] Brother Bam said even in sexual
[1:32:30] temptation he was tempted in
[1:32:33] it. Was that God?
[1:32:36] That was a man
[1:32:38] [Music]
[1:32:39] like he
[1:32:41] died. God doesn't
[1:32:46] die. That was
[1:32:48] man. Not maybe man. God
[1:32:52] man. That was 100% man.
[1:32:58] He
[1:32:59] slept because he was
[1:33:02] tired. And when he
[1:33:06] slept, he would go into deep sleep. Then
[1:33:10] the sheep was going to
[1:33:11] run. That was
[1:33:14] mansing
[1:33:17] away. That was
[1:33:19] man. That was man like you. Like you
[1:33:22] like me. No difference. That's why we
[1:33:26] call him our
[1:33:28] brother. He was
[1:33:30] man. But you see when he woke
[1:33:34] up and he saw the storm, he said,
[1:33:39] "Peace, be still." That was not man.
[1:33:43] That was
[1:33:44] God, the creator of heaven and
[1:33:46] earth. When he wept, that was man. But
[1:33:51] after he
[1:33:52] wait then he said now man wait a moment
[1:33:57] flesh wait a moment we'll come back to
[1:33:59] that and then he began calling remove
[1:34:02] the stone roll it away and then he began
[1:34:06] shouting
[1:34:07] us forth that was
[1:34:11] God not
[1:34:13] man%
[1:34:15] God hallelujah so you see who was Jesus
[1:34:27] [Applause]
[1:34:29] Hallelujah. Amen. Why am I preaching
[1:34:31] this? Because Jesus Christ is the same.
[1:34:35] Yesterday,
[1:34:40] today
[1:34:44] even somebody
[1:34:49] get the
[1:34:51] same. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Who are
[1:34:55] you? Why me? 100%
[1:34:58] man. I
[1:35:00] am what is in
[1:35:05] there
[1:35:08] 100% God
[1:35:11] himself
[1:35:14] might of flesh.
[1:35:18] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. In a in a
[1:35:21] message testimony of a true
[1:35:23] witness, Judy says, "Oh God, what is it?
[1:35:28] The Holy Ghost, the true witness of
[1:35:31] God. The Holy Ghost, the true witness of
[1:35:34] God. What is
[1:35:41] it? That's what the Holy Spirit
[1:35:45] is. And the Holy Spirit says,
[1:35:47] "Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] Hallelujah. That's why when when you
[1:35:52] have
[1:35:52] issues, don't always think you are a
[1:35:55] man.
[1:35:58] When situations become tough, remember
[1:36:02] who you
[1:36:03] are. Hallelujah.
[1:36:06] Adoption is meant to put you in your
[1:36:09] right
[1:36:12] place. As a son of
[1:36:15] God, as a daughter of
[1:36:18] God, Jesus was a son of God. And that
[1:36:22] means he was
[1:36:24] God. Amen. When you realize you're a son
[1:36:26] of
[1:36:27] God, problems come sometimes. Remember
[1:36:31] who you
[1:36:32] are. Remember,
[1:36:34] [Applause]
[1:36:36] brother speak to the
[1:36:38] storm.
[1:36:40] Hallelujah. Amen. The power is within.
[1:36:44] The rapture is not
[1:36:49] coming. Hallelujah. Where? Why in you?
[1:36:55] What's the Holy Ghost?
[1:36:57] [Music]
[1:37:01] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Is everything is
[1:37:04] in knowing who you
[1:37:10] are. Amen. Amen. That's why the prophet
[1:37:15] says, "We know who she is. Once she
[1:37:18] stands, she will be an invisible." Amen.
[1:37:22] Amen. Amen. Why are we defeated?
[1:37:25] Why do we get anxiety? Why do we get
[1:37:28] depression? Why do we have problems? And
[1:37:31] we we cry and cry and cry because we are
[1:37:35] 100% man. But we forget who we
[1:37:40] are. Yes, we are man and we truly are
[1:37:45] God. Hallelujah.
[1:37:49] Let me tell you, the children of God are
[1:37:52] different from the children of the
[1:37:54] world. Hallelujah. When you have
[1:37:57] problems, don't cry as if you have no
[1:38:00] hope. God told Moses, I'll make you a
[1:38:06] god. I'll make you
[1:38:08] go. Not a second go of
[1:38:10] the third of
[1:38:14] the You will be God.
[1:38:17] And when Moses went among them, problems
[1:38:20] come.
[1:38:32] We need to change the way we
[1:38:35] pray. Amen. Amen. Let the religious
[1:38:39] denomination of
[1:38:41] people pray without
[1:38:43] revelation. Let them pray like that.
[1:38:49] Let me tell you, we should pray but not
[1:38:52] pray like
[1:38:54] them. Jesus said you don't receive
[1:38:57] because you pray
[1:38:58] amidst you should know who you are. Pray
[1:39:02] with
[1:39:04] revelation. And if you want to know how,
[1:39:07] go and see how David used to
[1:39:09] pray. He prayed with
[1:39:11] revelation. Amen. And now we see right
[1:39:15] there. God told Moses, "Moses, what is
[1:39:19] wrong with you?" Those are my words. I
[1:39:22] say, "Why
[1:39:24] [Music]
[1:39:28] cryposes?" I had to remember who he
[1:39:31] was. Hey, by the way, I can just
[1:39:36] talk and see
[1:39:38] pattern. Hallelujah.
[1:39:41] [Applause]
[1:39:43] Moses each
[1:39:44] time cried back to
[1:39:47] God. Even when God even when Moses went
[1:39:50] back to cry to
[1:39:51] God about how the children of Israel
[1:39:53] were
[1:39:55] complaining, they didn't have meat. They
[1:39:57] had only manner, God told him, Moses
[1:40:01] after the the words they had
[1:40:05] exchanged go back and strike with your
[1:40:08] rod, strike the rock and the water will
[1:40:11] come out.
[1:40:12] What happened? Was there anything
[1:40:15] new? The rod was with Moses. The word
[1:40:18] was with Moses. The hand was the hand of
[1:40:21] Moses. Everything you need is right in
[1:40:24] you.
[1:40:28] Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:40:30] You have to know who you are.
[1:40:34] The work of the
[1:40:36] ministry is to bring you to the
[1:40:39] realization
[1:40:44] of who you
[1:40:46] are. This by the way is the real message
[1:40:49] of the
[1:40:52] hour. Everything else is
[1:40:56] details. The message of the hour is you
[1:41:00] knowing who you
[1:41:02] are. Amen. There are some demons which
[1:41:06] used to defeat
[1:41:07] me and I would cry to God every time I
[1:41:10] come. I
[1:41:13] cry if you just come and take it
[1:41:18] away. How many feel like that? You feel
[1:41:21] like
[1:41:27] [Music]
[1:41:30] maybe but today I don't even remember
[1:41:34] when those demons now last
[1:41:37] overcame. Why? I realized who I
[1:41:40] am. I am a son of
[1:41:43] God. I realized I had authority. When
[1:41:47] you are a son, God is no longer here.
[1:41:53] God
[1:41:57] him
[1:42:01] spoke because the father is in the
[1:42:03] son and the son is
[1:42:07] adopted to
[1:42:11] speak your
[1:42:14] words. Amen. And it will be by
[1:42:17] revelation. It will not be by idol talk.
[1:42:21] It's not like the way
[1:42:23] the do it by
[1:42:25] revelation. You receive a revelation of
[1:42:28] who you are. You begin
[1:42:31] sometimes to speak things
[1:42:34] into amen.
[1:42:39] Oh glory. What church? That's the reason
[1:42:42] I can't take the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:43] Ghost of crying, shaking or speaking in
[1:42:46] tongues.
[1:42:51] or any
[1:42:53] sensation they are all
[1:42:57] right. Now some people read such
[1:43:00] quotes and they begin hitting on
[1:43:04] emotions. Brother Bham never hit on
[1:43:08] emotions. Emotions is part of the true
[1:43:11] Christian faith.
[1:43:15] But that's not
[1:43:18] it. There is
[1:43:20] more. He says that's all right. The
[1:43:24] things are all right. But the devil can
[1:43:26] impersonate that. So
[1:43:31] real. What is the Holy Ghost? The Holy
[1:43:34] Ghost is not crying. The Holy Ghost is
[1:43:37] not crying. The Holy Ghost is not
[1:43:39] feeling. He is not speaking inside. He's
[1:43:43] not shouting. There is something else.
[1:43:46] We need to
[1:43:47] understand the Holy
[1:43:52] Ghost. And he continues on to say
[1:43:58] God in
[1:44:00] man. It is more than a
[1:44:06] sens. It is more than
[1:44:08] shouting. It is more than weeping. It is
[1:44:12] more than joining church.
[1:44:14] God
[1:44:15] himself living in
[1:44:20] man
[1:44:26] himself when we can
[1:44:29] speak and it's just the
[1:44:31] same as
[1:44:33] [Music]
[1:44:38] God. Hallelujah. That's the church. The
[1:44:42] way the first apostolic church went
[1:44:46] for God
[1:44:50] himself where you can speak and it is
[1:44:53] God
[1:44:55] speaking.
[1:44:57] Amen. I know there are some brothers who
[1:45:01] say that's the third
[1:45:02] pool which I also believe
[1:45:05] is but the problem they say it will come
[1:45:08] in the
[1:45:10] future. Well, let me tell you
[1:45:16] something. There is nothing new coming.
[1:45:19] All
[1:45:20] things are
[1:45:22] finished.
[1:45:28] Hallelujah. The mystery of
[1:45:33] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. The
[1:45:36] mystery of God. Everybody answer me will
[1:45:39] [Music]
[1:45:42] be there's no more
[1:45:44] revelation. There's no more new thinker.
[1:45:47] It is all
[1:45:49] here.
[1:45:52] Hallelujah. And would
[1:45:54] speak life into the little
[1:45:57] form would
[1:45:59] speak, you know,
[1:46:05] squeeth. Can that happen now?
[1:46:08] Is it
[1:46:10] possible or is it in the
[1:46:12] future? Jesus. Yes.
[1:46:17] The
[1:46:20] today what he did
[1:46:23] yesterday will do the
[1:46:25] same. If it was
[1:46:27] God in Jesus, it is
[1:46:31] God and you look the same
[1:46:35] God, the same power.
[1:46:40] Hallelujah. He is 100%
[1:46:43] man. 100%
[1:46:45] God. 100%
[1:46:49] man% man. God raising the dead. 100% man
[1:46:56] sleeping. 100% God. Call me in the seas.
[1:47:03] If you want to see the man in
[1:47:05] me, I am right
[1:47:07] here. But I tell you, there is something
[1:47:10] else. What you're hearing talking about
[1:47:14] me is
[1:47:17] God. And there's a God part in you,
[1:47:23] sister in
[1:47:27] you. And you live on it, another part in
[1:47:31] you. Amen.
[1:47:35] Hallelujah.
[1:47:42] Without what I'm preaching to
[1:47:45] you, is the message of the
[1:47:48] hour, not my
[1:47:54] interpretation. Okay. As I'm approaching
[1:47:57] to finish, let me read you some more.
[1:48:00] testimony of a true witness. We need a
[1:48:04] we need a day of weeping and
[1:48:07] mourning waiting until God sends the
[1:48:11] Holy
[1:48:13] Ghost. His
[1:48:15] witness, not an empty
[1:48:20] shell, not an empty
[1:48:23] denomination. You see, we say we have
[1:48:26] the Holy Ghost, have the Holy Ghost, but
[1:48:28] we have so many troubles.
[1:48:30] and so many
[1:48:32] problems. We need a
[1:48:34] sh of the real Holy
[1:48:37] Ghost and Bible says we need a week. We
[1:48:40] need a morning until God sends that Holy
[1:48:46] Ghost. And he says, "What is it?" Not,
[1:48:49] not an empty
[1:48:51] shell, not an empty
[1:48:53] denomination, but
[1:49:02] Amen. Jesus said in Mark
[1:49:05] 16 that the Holy Ghost when he come he
[1:49:09] will
[1:49:09] testify in every succeeding
[1:49:13] generation. Amen. Every generation
[1:49:17] brother even our
[1:49:18] generation. Hallelujah. To the
[1:49:22] end
[1:49:24] signs the
[1:49:27] these signs follow them that
[1:49:30] believe in my name they shall cast out.
[1:49:34] How long is this witness going to
[1:49:36] be to the end of the world?
[1:49:40] How
[1:49:42] long? Every
[1:49:45] generation in my
[1:49:48] name, they shall speak with if they take
[1:49:52] up
[1:49:54] drink, it wouldn't harm them. If they
[1:49:57] lay hands on the sick, they shall
[1:50:01] recover. Jesus said the Holy Spirit that
[1:50:05] he would send would be a witness.
[1:50:11] to the end of the
[1:50:13] age. Every
[1:50:15] generation now being that he said
[1:50:19] that we we are
[1:50:24] witnesses. Amen. Amen. And the
[1:50:27] prophecies in closing and
[1:50:29] close, put on your understanding
[1:50:32] now and listen as I close. We are
[1:50:36] witnesses.
[1:50:38] We have received
[1:50:41] his way. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. I am a
[1:50:45] child of
[1:50:46] God. I'm
[1:50:47] fil. I am a
[1:50:50] witness. Are you a
[1:50:52] witness? I am a witness. I right now. I
[1:50:57] have a right to cast out
[1:51:01] every Hallelujah.
[1:51:04] Maybe you are
[1:51:06] tormented by a demon of
[1:51:11] oppression. I cast
[1:51:14] it
[1:51:16] out. Amen. Yes, sir. Amen. I mean, I
[1:51:20] have a right to speak
[1:51:23] healing. Just speaking
[1:51:26] it. Speak
[1:51:31] healing. What is your desire?
[1:51:34] You remember pastor Manda in a
[1:51:37] convention? What was his sermon? Someone
[1:51:41] helped. What was his sermon? He was
[1:51:44] speaking something on this
[1:51:47] line. And then when he spoke, you know,
[1:51:52] you know, he gave many people
[1:51:54] things. I give you this. I give you
[1:51:56] this. I give you this. Let me tell you,
[1:51:58] I had to shut it off.
[1:52:01] I have been having testimony after
[1:52:02] testimony after testimony
[1:52:05] after people saying exactly the way the
[1:52:08] preacher said it. I received I received
[1:52:12] physical
[1:52:13] things. The same God who gives physical
[1:52:16] things can give spiritual
[1:52:19] things. Amen. Amen. Amen. What's your
[1:52:23] desire even to you streaming right now?
[1:52:27] Can we put this to a test right now?
[1:52:31] What's your desire in the name of Jesus?
[1:52:34] I give it to
[1:52:36] you. Hallelujah. Amen. Yes, sir.
[1:52:40] Hallelujah.
[1:52:45] Amen. I give you back your
[1:52:48] life. And the fish went back in
[1:52:51] our dead. Let me tell you is the same
[1:52:56] yesterday, today and
[1:52:59] forever. Amen. Your business is
[1:53:04] crumbling in the name of Jesus. I put
[1:53:07] more capital in your
[1:53:09] business. Hallelujah. Your family is
[1:53:12] falling
[1:53:13] apart. Amen. I speak life in your family
[1:53:17] in the name of
[1:53:19] Jesus. You will not lose your mind. You
[1:53:22] will not lose your mind in the name of
[1:53:26] Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:53:29] Hallelujah. Praise the name of the
[1:53:32] Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah. He's
[1:53:36] the same God
[1:53:38] today. Amen. In in the message, my new
[1:53:42] ministry as we are closing right now.
[1:53:45] But the Bible says the God that so
[1:53:48] strange, it does things so strange. All
[1:53:51] of a sudden I failed. There was coming
[1:53:54] something down over the top of them
[1:53:58] woods. The Holy Spirit moved down and
[1:54:01] said, "Stand up." And said, "Speak to
[1:54:05] that little
[1:54:06] fish. It is not a man
[1:54:08] presuming the Holy
[1:54:11] Spirit being a witness in
[1:54:16] you." And he said, "Speak to that fish.
[1:54:21] and it shall have
[1:54:22] life again. It had been laying there
[1:54:27] dead half an
[1:54:29] hour. It was floating in the
[1:54:33] winds and by the bottom said I
[1:54:37] said little
[1:54:39] fishy. He did not pray. is saying little
[1:54:44] fish I give you your
[1:54:47] life in the name of the Lord
[1:54:51] Jesus that little
[1:54:54] fish that little
[1:54:56] fish you want to hear this turned
[1:55:02] over flipped
[1:55:04] up and went out right through the
[1:55:08] water just as hard as he could go.
[1:55:13] I stood there not knowing what to
[1:55:17] do. When you are adopted son of
[1:55:20] God, your words have
[1:55:24] authority. Your words give
[1:55:27] life. Amen. You have joy in
[1:55:31] you. Everybody close your eyes and begin
[1:55:35] to speak to your situation. Even the
[1:55:37] brethren on Zoom, on YouTube, wherever
[1:55:39] you are, let us begin to study by
[1:55:42] revelation by
[1:55:47] saying
[1:55:48] God here today, doing this very
[1:55:54] same that he did
[1:55:57] before. Is a living
[1:56:01] God. He's a living
[1:56:04] God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you,
[1:56:08] Jesus.
[1:56:10] Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:56:13] Amen. Amen. As they're going to switch
[1:56:16] off the brethren on
[1:56:18] Zoom, I want to speak to
[1:56:21] them. Whatever is dead in your
[1:56:23] life, I speak life. I speak life in the
[1:56:28] name of Jesus. Amen. May God raise you
[1:56:32] again. May God bring you back again to
[1:56:35] life.
[1:56:36] You're a living God.
[1:56:40] Amen. Amen. To you are here right now,
[1:56:44] I want you to
[1:56:45] believe for the supernatural
[1:56:49] right
[1:56:53] now. Yes, it's a Wednesday prayer
[1:56:57] meeting. Can we mean business for just a
[1:57:01] few minutes?
[1:57:05] is the same
[1:57:07] yesterday. What is bigger than this
[1:57:13] God? There is no situation
[1:57:16] bigger. There is no power
[1:57:19] bigger. There is no force
[1:57:22] higher. He's here right
[1:57:24] now to bring
[1:57:26] restoration. Amen. to bring
[1:57:30] restoration to
[1:57:33] you in your
[1:57:35] mind, to bring
[1:57:40] healing. Maybe you're believing for your
[1:57:43] children. I want you to believe and hold
[1:57:47] it in your heart and speak it. Speak
[1:57:52] it. It shall come to pass. Whatsoever
[1:57:56] you desire, speak it by
[1:57:59] revelation. The Holy Spirit is right
[1:58:01] here
[1:58:02] now charging on our
[1:58:04] lives, directing you what to
[1:58:07] say. Say faith by
[1:58:09] faith. Hold on to it and
[1:58:13] believe because God is
[1:58:16] God and he keeps his
[1:58:18] word. He never
[1:58:21] fails. He's the same yesterday and
[1:58:23] forever.
[1:58:26] Oh hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you
[1:58:29] Lord Jesus.
[1:58:33] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:58:40] Oh hallelujah.
[1:59:04] Come on.
[1:59:08] [Music]
[1:59:21] Hear the
[1:59:24] cries of the
[1:59:27] shackle from the
[1:59:31] onset of time.
[1:59:35] For the
[1:59:37] chains of defeat, there's no
[1:59:46] key. See the
[1:59:49] tears, all the
[1:59:52] broken, the cries
[1:59:55] of the slaves.
[1:59:59] Is there no
[2:00:01] one worthy to set us
[2:00:09] free? Then the
[2:00:13] crying is
[2:00:16] still as the
[2:00:19] chorus rings
[2:00:21] out. A
[2:00:24] shackle release from their
[2:00:32] chain and
[2:00:35] thousand of
[2:00:38] voices as we
[2:00:41] hear the song.
[2:00:47] the
[2:00:48] lamb that was
[2:00:53] slain. Everybody sing it now with me.
[2:01:00] [Music]
[2:01:01] Worthy.
[2:01:07] Worthy.
[2:01:10] Worthy is the
[2:01:13] lamb that
[2:01:17] was
[2:01:19] worthy.
[2:01:23] Worthy. Worthy.
[2:01:28] Worthy. You're
[2:01:34] worthy. He's a
[2:01:37] lamb that
[2:01:43] was in
[2:01:45] all the
[2:01:49] angels, the saint
[2:01:52] of all time.
[2:01:56] [Music]
[2:01:58] Holding the
[2:02:08] ground. Oh, fall
[2:02:11] down before
[2:02:14] he
[2:02:17] join the song.
[2:02:30] Oh,
[2:02:37] I
[2:02:43] wonder
[2:02:48] why in
[2:02:52] That
[2:02:53] [Music]
[2:02:55] was
[2:02:58] crazy.
[2:03:01] Crazy.
[2:03:05] Crazy.
[2:03:08] Crazy.
[2:03:11] Crazy.
[2:03:13] Praise the Lord.
[2:03:19] Close your eyes. Lift up your hands. I
[2:03:22] love
[2:03:23] you. I love you. Sing it from the bottom
[2:03:27] of your heart. I love
[2:03:29] you. I love
[2:03:32] you. I love
[2:03:35] you. I
[2:03:39] love
[2:03:45] you. Heat.
[2:03:57] Heat.
[2:04:02] Heat.
[2:04:12] Heat. Heat.
[2:04:23] Heat.
[2:04:28] Heat. Heat.
[2:04:49] Worthy,
[2:04:52] worthy,
[2:04:55] worthy. He's the
[2:04:58] lamb that was saved.
[2:05:07] Now, I'd like to pray for
[2:05:09] [Music]
[2:05:15] you. I I want those with with real big
[2:05:20] issues to please lift up your
[2:05:23] hand. Everybody just close your
[2:05:26] eyes. I want you to pray in your
[2:05:29] heart. Ask the Lord to remember
[2:05:32] you. As I
[2:05:35] pray, if you hear your issue
[2:05:38] mentioned, just know God has remembered
[2:05:41] you and he's handling your
[2:05:44] matter because it's a lamb that was
[2:05:48] slain and he's here. Not just with us,
[2:05:53] but in
[2:05:55] [Music]
[2:05:58] us. God fulfilling what he said.
[2:06:03] loving
[2:06:06] Jesus. Oh
[2:06:09] God, with sincerity we want to come
[2:06:11] before you
[2:06:13] Lord. When we think about
[2:06:16] ourselves, we think about ourselves as
[2:06:19] man, as
[2:06:21] humans, the Lord, there is more than
[2:06:24] this. Is you dwelling in
[2:06:27] us? The Holy Spirit
[2:06:31] deity in
[2:06:33] mind. Is there anything too big for our
[2:06:36] God?
[2:06:38] Lord
[2:06:39] Jesus, come right now and give
[2:06:41] leadership to your
[2:06:43] daughters. Give them guidance. Give them
[2:06:46] strength, Lord
[2:06:47] Jesus. Oh, because you are a living God.
[2:06:51] You are here right now in a ministry
[2:06:54] father. Lord, to give
[2:06:57] strength because you are a living
[2:07:00] God. Lord Jesus, you're taking away all
[2:07:03] worries.
[2:07:04] Lord, you are taking away all
[2:07:07] fear. You're replacing it with strength
[2:07:09] and
[2:07:11] boldness. Father Lord, your son needs
[2:07:13] you right now. Saying, "Oh God, I'm
[2:07:16] confused. I don't know what to
[2:07:18] do. Give me grace to go through this.
[2:07:21] Lord, you're not only giving them grace,
[2:07:24] you are giving them
[2:07:25] boldness, you're giving them power
[2:07:28] because they are the sons of God.
[2:07:32] Lord Jesus, you're reminding us of who
[2:07:34] we are. You are giving us
[2:07:36] grace to understand who we are this
[2:07:40] year. Lord, if you can reveal to each
[2:07:42] and every one of us who they
[2:07:46] are, Lord, you will cause a healing to
[2:07:48] happen.
[2:07:50] He will cause all the needs to be
[2:07:54] provided, all the confusion to go
[2:07:57] away, the troubles to go away. Not
[2:08:00] because they've gone
[2:08:02] away because your son, your
[2:08:06] daughter has gone
[2:08:09] higher, than their
[2:08:11] problems, higher than their
[2:08:13] troubles, higher than their
[2:08:15] issues. Lord Jesus remain man all the
[2:08:18] time.
[2:08:20] You remain man,
[2:08:22] human all the
[2:08:24] time when you were on earth. But Lord
[2:08:28] Jesus, each time when a situation
[2:08:31] came, Lord, you went beyond
[2:08:34] who they thought you were and who you
[2:08:37] felt you were. You went beyond the
[2:08:41] crying and you cried out with boldness.
[2:08:45] You said
[2:08:46] Lazarus come forth. That was the
[2:08:49] authority of the Lord Jesus the creator
[2:08:52] of heaven and earth that will raise a
[2:08:55] dead. There is some dead situations
[2:08:58] here. I speak
[2:09:00] life into those
[2:09:02] situations that there may be life. Lord
[2:09:06] Jesus being a man sleeping and tired and
[2:09:11] weary. But as God you would speak
[2:09:14] for and you say
[2:09:16] peace be
[2:09:19] still Lord let the peace beyond all
[2:09:25] understanding come upon your children
[2:09:28] Lord. Maybe someone has been Lord having
[2:09:31] some sort of confusion and
[2:09:33] troubles. May they walk out of you Lord.
[2:09:36] with peace in their
[2:09:38] hearts. Grant it
[2:09:40] Lord. Bless us as we will
[2:09:43] go. Even as we shall give, bless the
[2:09:47] giver in Jesus
[2:09:49] name.
