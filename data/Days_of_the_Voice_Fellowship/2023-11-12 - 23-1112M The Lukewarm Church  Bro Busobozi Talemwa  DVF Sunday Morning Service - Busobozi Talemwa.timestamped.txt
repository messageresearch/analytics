[1:14:25] step out of the

[1:14:33] own they just the gift that you've given
[1:14:36] to me to bless your
[1:14:40] people and I realize it's not mine it is
[1:14:42] for your people
[1:14:45] Lord and Lord as we've been told that a
[1:14:47] gift is just a man taking himself out of
[1:14:50] the way and letting God use that gift
[1:14:59] and Lord I know that these people also
[1:15:01] have the power to to to uh make it
[1:15:07] work by receiving and saying Amen to
[1:15:12] the may you speak to each one of
[1:15:15] them in Jesus
[1:15:17] name amen please be
[1:15:22] seated
[1:15:25] praise
[1:15:27] God so I'm speaking to you today on the
[1:15:30] subject of the lukewarm
[1:15:41] church the lukew
[1:15:45] church on vers 16 he said because you
[1:15:49] are
[1:15:50] Lam and neither cold nor hot I will
[1:15:53] speak the out of my
[1:16:03] mouth we are at a time when history is
[1:16:06] being
[1:16:09] fulfilled we are at a time that we call
[1:16:12] the
[1:16:15] end and it is surely the
[1:16:18] end and you see the Bible says there is
[1:16:21] no new thing under the Earth
[1:16:25] whatever has whatever is has
[1:16:28] been and whatever will be shall be
[1:16:35] again there was once a time on Earth
[1:16:38] that was called the end
[1:16:42] time and there were men of God like for
[1:16:45] instance
[1:16:47] Noah that God sent to preach an end time
[1:16:52] message
[1:16:54] but if it was the
[1:16:56] end God Was preparing to destroy the
[1:16:59] world with
[1:17:02] water and water would come from above
[1:17:04] and water would come from below the
[1:17:07] Earth and and the people did not hear
[1:17:11] Noah but the word of God that he had
[1:17:14] given to Noah came to pass
[1:17:19] 100% but I want to show you something
[1:17:22] here that we have arrived at another end
[1:17:27] time in the days of Noah he destroyed
[1:17:30] the world with
[1:17:33] water but in these days our
[1:17:36] days he has promised to destroy the
[1:17:39] world with
[1:17:42] fire if you you you check with me in the
[1:17:45] Book of Malachi chapter chapter 4 is
[1:17:48] just one of those many
[1:17:52] scriptures
[1:17:55] that's the first
[1:17:57] verse for behold the day cometh that
[1:17:59] shall burn as an oven and all the proud
[1:18:02] yeah and all that do wickedly shall be
[1:18:04] stubble and the day that cometh shall
[1:18:06] burn them up sayith the Lord of host
[1:18:07] that it shall leave them neither
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:21] rootch
[1:18:29] that day is
[1:18:31] coming and that day is going to be
[1:18:34] hot the Bible says as we have read it
[1:18:37] shall burn as an
[1:18:41] oven if you continue
[1:18:43] reading the Bible says that the
[1:18:47] righteous shall St over the ashes of the
[1:18:51] wicked
[1:18:53] that is going to
[1:18:55] happen there is going to be a
[1:18:58] time that the wicked shall be ashes
[1:19:01] under the the feet of the
[1:19:06] righteous the wicked are those that do
[1:19:08] not accept the end time
[1:19:13] message the wicked are those when God
[1:19:16] sends his message they
[1:19:20] it they don't receive it just carry on
[1:19:23] in their own denominations in their own
[1:19:25] beliefs in their own
[1:19:29] systems so they don't give honor to the
[1:19:32] word of
[1:19:34] God and and the righteous are those that
[1:19:37] accept the message of the
[1:19:40] hour when I say the message of the hour
[1:19:43] I mean the message that God sends in
[1:19:45] that given
[1:19:50] time in every time God sends is a
[1:19:53] special message for that
[1:19:56] generation and those who receive that
[1:19:59] message they will be considered
[1:20:03] righteous and they will be taken in the
[1:20:06] Rapture and the rest of the people shall
[1:20:08] go in a
[1:20:10] tribulation and all the elements will
[1:20:13] burn
[1:20:16] up end of the
[1:20:19] tribulation part of the burning will
[1:20:21] come from the Armageddon
[1:20:27] we third world
[1:20:31] war and part of the elements that will
[1:20:33] burn the Earth will come out of
[1:20:37] that why do you think that America has
[1:20:40] um uh you know weapons that can actually
[1:20:42] literally destroy the whole
[1:20:48] world Russia has weapons that can
[1:20:51] actually wipe out America from
[1:20:56] the and
[1:20:59] all I always on
[1:21:03] tension why do you think America did not
[1:21:06] just go to fight
[1:21:09] Russia because Russia has nuclear
[1:21:15] weapons and and America will go and
[1:21:18] Destroy
[1:21:21] Libya because they have to
[1:21:23] fear Libya does did not have nuclear
[1:21:28] weapons and why is America trying to
[1:21:31] fight Iran from receiving or or making
[1:21:35] nuclear
[1:21:38] weapons because if Iran gets nuclear
[1:21:42] weapon they will also become
[1:21:46] Untouchable any nation that has nuclear
[1:21:50] weapons is considered a great
[1:21:54] nation why because nuclear war can
[1:21:57] literally destroy the
[1:22:03] world you see our Prophet brother bham
[1:22:05] said
[1:22:07] something down there in
[1:22:10] Russia maybe someone who is drunk or
[1:22:13] someone who is you know a little
[1:22:20] off and start a new
[1:22:25] war and we see that those things are
[1:22:27] bound to
[1:22:29] happen and the fire all this fire
[1:22:33] power that all these nations
[1:22:36] have you know it has to be put to use
[1:22:39] one
[1:22:41] day it has to be put to use one
[1:22:45] day the all way to the people who shall
[1:22:48] be on Earth at that
[1:22:50] time it will be a great time of
[1:22:53] Destruction pain and
[1:22:57] suffering it is bound to
[1:22:59] happen it is going to happen are you
[1:23:03] hearing me Church America will fight
[1:23:05] with
[1:23:07] Russia and Russia and America and then
[1:23:10] other countries combined
[1:23:16] together and we notice here that when
[1:23:20] this
[1:23:21] happens
[1:23:23] it will cause a third world
[1:23:26] war this is the war that the Bible calls
[1:23:31] Armageddon I'm glad I will not be here
[1:23:34] during that
[1:23:36] time I'm glad I'll will be taken up in
[1:23:38] the
[1:23:39] Rapture I'll be out of
[1:23:42] here it should be your goal
[1:23:44] too it should be your goal too and we
[1:23:48] notice that when this
[1:23:50] happens it will destroy everything thing
[1:23:52] on
[1:23:53] earth it will destroy the civilization
[1:23:56] as we know it
[1:23:58] today will destroy America that people
[1:24:01] crave to literally go
[1:24:06] to it will destroy
[1:24:08] Canada it will destroy New Zealand it
[1:24:11] will destroy the UK as we
[1:24:14] know it will destroy Australia
[1:24:17] AAL there will not be first world second
[1:24:20] world and third world countries
[1:24:25] it will be all turned to
[1:24:29] us it will all be turned to
[1:24:32] us are you hearing me that's why your
[1:24:36] goal should not be to go to America your
[1:24:38] goal should be to go to the
[1:24:46] Rapture it doesn't matter which country
[1:24:48] you'll be in at time the Judgment of God
[1:24:52] will strike and it will strike
[1:24:56] everybody and then the Bible says they
[1:24:59] that fear the name of the
[1:25:00] Lord shall step over those the wicked
[1:25:04] they will be because the wicked shall be
[1:25:06] like ashes under their
[1:25:10] feet those fires will
[1:25:14] destroy even all the religions and the
[1:25:17] churches it will even destroy
[1:25:21] Vatican destroy all the systems of
[1:25:26] man there will be no system of
[1:25:29] government that shall
[1:25:32] remain are you hearing me it will all be
[1:25:36] wiped
[1:25:38] out all everything will be
[1:25:41] wiped
[1:25:43] removed why because God will be
[1:25:47] preparing to bring down his
[1:25:51] kingdom Marin spoke on let thy kingdom
[1:25:56] come and part of what I'm speaking is
[1:25:58] really inspired by here
[1:26:01] someone the whole kingdoms of the world
[1:26:04] will be wiped
[1:26:06] up God shall have another
[1:26:10] kingdom and this Kingdom will not be his
[1:26:15] alone it will be his together with his
[1:26:18] [Applause]
[1:26:20] bride the one that was vict
[1:26:23] torious the one the Bible speaks of and
[1:26:26] he says to him that shall
[1:26:30] overcome there is going to be one that
[1:26:33] will overcome in every
[1:26:36] generation I don't know about you but I
[1:26:39] believe I am one of
[1:26:41] those in my generation I'm one of the
[1:26:45] over you must step on sin
[1:26:49] now in order for you to step on the
[1:26:52] Wicked
[1:26:55] then praise God yes sir and then they
[1:27:00] that you shall
[1:27:01] overcome shall be together with him and
[1:27:04] the Bible says we shall
[1:27:07] re with him for 1,000
[1:27:13] years one day with the Lord is like a
[1:27:16] thousand
[1:27:18] years 1,00 years is like one day
[1:27:22] so if he says we shall re with him for
[1:27:24] 1,000
[1:27:26] years how many years do you think it
[1:27:29] will
[1:27:30] be it's going to be a really long
[1:27:34] time and we will re with
[1:27:37] him the wicked will be ases under
[1:27:41] our there will be people that will
[1:27:45] survive
[1:27:46] areon and they will remain here on
[1:27:49] Earth but we the bride will rule over

[1:28:43] city they cannot even try to understand
[1:28:46] what we are made
[1:28:48] of that's why they have even even acted
[1:28:52] movies out of
[1:28:54] those and then they there's a movie they
[1:28:57] acted I think it was called
[1:29:00] 2012 and they said the whole world was
[1:29:03] destroyed with nuclear

[1:32:27] was
[1:32:28] bound in Chains and he was thrown into
[1:32:31] the bottomless
[1:32:34] pit and the lead was
[1:32:37] covered but right now the bottomless pit
[1:32:40] is
[1:32:42] open and all the demons are here on
[1:32:46] Earth but there is coming a Time When
[1:32:49] sin will not rain over
[1:32:53] bodies that there will be no
[1:32:55] temptation there will be no sorrow there
[1:32:58] will be pain there will be no poverty
[1:33:02] there will not be any problem because
[1:33:04] the devil will be in the
[1:33:07] bottomless I can't wait for that time
[1:33:11] because I will then laugh over the
[1:33:14] devil because this will be my
[1:33:17] time of
[1:33:19] rejoicing that's why the Bible says
[1:33:22] Rejoice not against me my en when I fall
[1:33:26] I shall
[1:33:27] rise right now I am here falling in this
[1:33:31] body but one day I'm going to arise I

[1:33:37] body these B of
[1:33:41] B will open up and my soul will come out
[1:33:45] and I will have another
[1:33:47] body Rejoice not against me or my enemy
[1:33:51] I sit in darkness the Lord shall be my
[1:33:55] light and then he continues on and he

[1:34:02] enemy shall see it and shame shall cover
[1:34:07] her him that said where is your
[1:34:10] god that time of the
[1:34:13] Millen will be our time ashame the
[1:34:18] devil completely
[1:34:20] and
[1:34:22] because it is our time to prove we are
[1:34:25] in
[1:34:27] charge Hallelujah right now we are
[1:34:30] potentially in
[1:34:31] charge in Heavenly places and when we
[1:34:35] come out of Heaven places and we come
[1:34:38] here in noral
[1:34:39] daylight we get tempted and
[1:34:42] tried and then we sing a
[1:34:49] song why it should be
[1:34:54] the but wait a moment time is coming
[1:34:57] when that song will be completely
[1:35:01] gone the Bible say and they will sing a
[1:35:05] new
[1:35:08] song hallelujah hallelujah amen we shall
[1:35:11] have a new song we will no longer sing

[1:35:29] be nothing like humility at that
[1:35:32] time let me not speak big
[1:35:35] things no we will say it because that's
[1:35:38] how we shall
[1:35:40] be we are that's why even the Bible says
[1:35:42] right
[1:35:43] now we are
[1:35:45] Royals we are Kings and
[1:35:47] Priests with God at that time we shall
[1:35:51] exercise it physically and
[1:35:56] spiritually and everything I'm
[1:35:59] saying it is already
[1:36:02] here
[1:36:04] potentially praise
[1:36:06] God and if a child of God born
[1:36:10] again knows their
[1:36:13] place they can exercise that
[1:36:16] power even right
[1:36:19] now hallelujah praise God
[1:36:22] hallelujah hallelujah I can't wait for
[1:36:24] that
[1:36:25] time I will be there these days when

[1:37:37] Millennium you will have it
[1:37:40] 100 your joy shall be
[1:37:44] full brother sister prepare for that
[1:37:49] place and now we see that there is Seven
[1:37:52] Ages and from
[1:37:57] Ephesus
[1:38:01] SEL all these
[1:38:03] ages but the last one is going to
[1:38:08] be that one is going to be the last
[1:38:12] last and when the saints that shall be
[1:38:17] at they would say we are in the end time
[1:38:22] that when that age of
[1:38:25] comes nothing left but the
[1:38:29] Rapture after the
[1:38:31] rupture
[1:38:33] millenum you understand me so where are
[1:38:36] we now we
[1:38:39] are we have
[1:38:42] arrived at the last
[1:38:50] one
[1:38:51] but the Bible has this to say
[1:38:56] about because the devil knows this is
[1:38:59] the last chance he
[1:39:01] has he has to capture as many as
[1:39:04] possible he has to hind as many as
[1:39:09] possible he's trying his best to hind
[1:39:13] them and he
[1:39:15] says to the Church of the
[1:39:19] Lans this is verse 14 now
[1:39:22] Revelation
[1:39:23] 3 right this thing say the
[1:39:30] amen the faithful and true
[1:39:33] [Music]
[1:39:35] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:39:39] God he speaking to the church
[1:39:45] now is a
[1:39:48] combination of the true church and the
[1:39:53] church just like every other Church age
[1:39:55] has
[1:39:57] been but the condition of the time
[1:40:03] of
[1:40:05] [Applause]
[1:40:07] church is this
[1:40:10] way let me give you a little bit of
[1:40:12] background
[1:40:15] here was a city in Asia
[1:40:19] Minor
[1:40:22] in present day
[1:40:25] Turkey and there was a
[1:40:29] river that came
[1:40:32] down
[1:40:33] [Music]
[1:40:35] through it came in
[1:40:39] h but by the time it would arrive
[1:40:44] at the temperatures would
[1:40:46] [Music]
[1:40:47] change it would not be cold
[1:40:51] it would not
[1:40:54] be and then was
[1:40:59] used as a symbol of the last
[1:41:09] age which we are now
[1:41:11] leaving it was a symb of the last
[1:41:15] church last gentle
[1:41:18] dispensation the church is not
[1:41:22] cold the church is not
[1:41:25] hot the church is in the
[1:41:29] middle inop
[1:41:34] we the
[1:41:39] middle so that because he says because
[1:41:42] you
[1:41:44] are you are not hot how many have ever
[1:41:48] drunk or put in the mouth
[1:41:55] [Music]
[1:41:56] you feel like
[1:41:58] vomiting the
[1:42:01] church
[1:42:03] isuk it's not hot not
[1:42:07] C you have
[1:42:09] people that are both
[1:42:12] Sinners and
[1:42:15] Believers at the same
[1:42:18] time people that live kinds of
[1:42:24] life people who are in
[1:42:26] church but they practice
[1:42:31] witcraft people that are called by the
[1:42:33] name of a
[1:42:35] Believer but they are
[1:42:40] fornicators people who are in the
[1:42:42] church they are called
[1:42:44] Christians but they are very good
[1:42:48] liars did you know Liars have their
[1:42:51] place in the in Hell
[1:42:55] Fire Liars are going to go to
[1:42:58] hell there's no better way about
[1:43:03] that
[1:43:05] and has Believers in the
[1:43:09] church but they tell
[1:43:12] lies tell
[1:43:14] lies and a person tells a lie and is not
[1:43:17] moved a
[1:43:19] bit
[1:43:24] he just moves on right
[1:43:27] on it's all
[1:43:30] right a
[1:43:33] church people who come to
[1:43:36] church and they are
[1:43:40] thieves and there is no small thief or
[1:43:42] Big
[1:43:45] Thief if you are a thief you a
[1:43:48] thief the Bible did not say big and
[1:43:54] smallen a
[1:43:57] little you are a
[1:44:00] thief no matter what you have
[1:44:04] stolen I hope you like me after
[1:44:09] this you have people who are in the
[1:44:12] church and they just go they're not
[1:44:15] mared but they are living like husband
[1:44:17] and
[1:44:19] wife
[1:44:21] and they come to church and they begin
[1:44:24] singing the grace of
[1:44:26] God and because the pastor
[1:44:29] preached with their long painted
[1:44:33] nails they begin touching their
[1:44:36] eyes because they are
[1:44:39] crying the pastor preach
[1:44:41] about if it wasn't for
[1:44:44] Grace with this fornication I'm
[1:44:47] living I would have
[1:44:49] died after after that they go back
[1:44:53] to why because they are not
[1:44:58] convicted it is a lukewarm
[1:45:02] Church they are not cold they are not
[1:45:05] hot this is a
[1:45:08] generation where Christian girls will
[1:45:11] dress like
[1:45:14] prostitutes you know we used to
[1:45:17] differentiate between a Christian and
[1:45:22] prostitute by the way they
[1:45:24] dress are you hearing me a Christian
[1:45:29] woman like a
[1:45:31] Christian but they
[1:45:33] pastors they L
[1:45:36] pastors they have said to them don't
[1:45:39] worry sister God sees your
[1:45:42] heart I believe that but why do I call
[1:45:46] them
[1:45:48] L because they did not tell them the
[1:45:51] next
[1:45:54] thing God sees your
[1:45:56] heart but what you do on the
[1:45:59] outside shows what is in your
[1:46:02] heart it means you are not
[1:46:05] changed it means you not convicted of
[1:46:09] sin it means you have not yet found a
[1:46:13] savior but when you find a savior you
[1:46:16] will throw away those trouser
[1:46:19] sisters you will throw away the
[1:46:21] Min you will away the
[1:46:26] Mak
[1:46:29] jeel you will throw it away you will
[1:46:32] know there is one thing to be a
[1:46:33] Christian and another to be
[1:46:37] World there must be a
[1:46:40] distinction between the
[1:46:43] church and the world but today the
[1:46:47] Believers the ones who are professing
[1:46:50] the name of
[1:46:52] Jesus they are not hot they are not cold
[1:46:56] they are lukew
[1:46:59] they in the
[1:47:03] middle and maybe you are one of them
[1:47:07] today if you're one of them today my
[1:47:10] prayer for you today is that you will
[1:47:13] not walk out of that
[1:47:15] door until you found

[2:08:24] it I have not being very sorry because I
[2:08:27] gave I gave up my

[2:09:27] some
[2:09:29] re make God his business your
[2:09:33] business and he will also take care of
[2:09:36] yours but the people are so much lovers
[2:09:39] of
[2:09:40] Pleasures more than lovers of God the
[2:09:44] things of the world make them
[2:09:47] happy but the things of God bore
[2:09:54] them and he continues on to say having a
[2:09:57] form of
[2:10:00] godliness but denying the power
[2:10:05] thereof did you hear that or you
[2:10:08] didn't they are not completely
[2:10:10] unreligious
[2:10:12] we are talking about people here who
[2:10:14] have a form of
[2:10:17] godl
[2:10:22] but they don't have the power
[2:10:25] there power of
[2:10:28] God is the Holy
[2:10:31] Spirit the power of God is the
[2:10:34] word the power of God brings
[2:10:36] Holiness the power of God makes you
[2:10:38] submit to the
[2:10:40] word but these people in our they have a
[2:10:43] form of
[2:10:45] godliness but they don't have the power
[2:10:47] of
[2:10:52] and he says these are the same kind of
[2:10:54] people who are like J and
[2:10:58] jamb they with
[2:11:01] Moses they resisted the
[2:11:03] truth they are men of corrupt

[2:16:16] God
[2:16:18] for the first time in all my
[2:16:21] life I stood
[2:16:23] before
[2:16:25] my my
[2:16:28] uncle the elder brother to my
[2:16:32] father he's the head of all the Winds of
[2:16:41] our not only our
[2:16:44] cran almost the entire region of where I
[2:16:47] come from
[2:16:50] and there a great power in this
[2:16:54] country he is a great
[2:16:57] power stood before him and I didn't
[2:17:01] fear I questioned him I looked at
[2:17:05] him in my
[2:17:08] eyes and I asked him a
[2:17:11] question about what he
[2:17:13] believes so I said so you you you this
[2:17:16] thing that you you Ser
[2:17:20] powerful he said oh yes it is powerful
[2:17:23] there even many pastors who have come
[2:17:25] here and they have have served
[2:17:28] them even singers even politicians have
[2:17:32] been serving
[2:17:33] them do you also want me to
[2:17:36] serve and I told him I said look here I
[2:17:40] don't want you to serve me because I
[2:17:42] have a higher
[2:17:45] power and when I said that
[2:17:48] his eyes began
[2:17:50] blazing I know then I disorganized these
[2:17:56] demons and and from that from that
[2:17:59] time I I saw one of my
[2:18:02] cousins said an educated young man so I
[2:18:05] decided to kind of take him to
[2:18:08] myself I wanted to kind of introduce to
[2:18:10] him the gospel and I invited him to my
[2:18:13] home and uh he at first he was forth
[2:18:17] coming
[2:18:19] and I told him so do you also
[2:18:21] serve he said yes I serve I said oh even
[2:18:25] when you
[2:18:26] educated he said yeah education does not
[2:18:28] know these
[2:18:29] things this is a power I told my brother
[2:18:34] but I want to meet you because I want to
[2:18:36] introduce you to my
[2:18:37] power my power is more mightier than
[2:18:40] yours and if you meet me you will know
[2:18:43] what I'm talking about that's the last
[2:18:45] time I talked to him
[2:18:48] he never wanted to come near
[2:18:51] my his powers misled him
[2:18:55] away but let anybody I don't care what
[2:18:58] they are involved in let them come under
[2:19:01] this
[2:19:02] power let them come under this
[2:19:06] power I hear some people who say that
[2:19:09] maybe someone Beed
[2:19:11] me you is a
[2:19:16] believer how can you say someone
[2:19:19] bech as a
[2:19:21] Believer do you know what they talking
[2:19:24] about this power we have is higher than
[2:19:28] witchcraft is stronger than
[2:19:31] witchcraft the power of
[2:19:33] Witchcraft can stand
[2:19:36] before a child of God that is on
[2:19:39] fire but if you look
[2:19:42] one you can
[2:19:46] be
[2:19:49] praise God it's a revelation it's an
[2:19:54] understanding look
[2:19:58] Church praise
[2:20:00] God J
[2:20:03] Spirit they all over making
[2:20:07] Crusades signs and wonders and people
[2:20:10] are saying this is the truth because
[2:20:12] there signs that wers there women on the
[2:20:15] pulpit show me anywhere in the
[2:20:18] Bible in the Church of the of
[2:20:21] Pentecost where a woman was a preacher
[2:20:24] or a Bible
[2:20:27] teacher nowhere in the
[2:20:29] Bible that's a larm
[2:20:32] church I don't care about the signs and
[2:20:35] wonders J and J could do
[2:20:39] them even more than what Moses had
[2:20:43] di they are very busy baptizing
[2:20:46] babies some of them they have even come
[2:20:48] to a
[2:20:50] level where they saying water baptism is
[2:20:52] not
[2:20:55] necessary you only need Holy Ghost
[2:20:58] baptism they are
[2:21:00] liars they are
[2:21:02] L they are not according to the
[2:21:05] Bible but a true church will say what
[2:21:09] the Bible
[2:21:10] says what does the Bible say in the book
[2:21:13] of Acts chapter 2 right there quickly
[2:21:19] now I want to show you
[2:21:22] that it says then Peter said unto them
[2:21:26] repent and be baptized every one of
[2:21:30] you in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:21:34] remission of your
[2:21:35] sins and ye shall receive the gift of
[2:21:38] the Holy
[2:21:40] Ghost can you say Amen if you believe
[2:21:43] it how does the Holy Spirit
[2:21:46] Come
[2:21:50] I ask again how does the Holy Ghost
[2:21:53] come what is the first
[2:21:57] thing
[2:21:59] repentance what is the second
[2:22:02] thing water
[2:22:06] baptism this is the
[2:22:10] foundation this is the
[2:22:13] foundation hallelujah amen and when the
[2:22:16] found is
[2:22:19] Lay he is going to put a whole
[2:22:23] plate what is a whole plate the
[2:22:26] remission of your
[2:22:28] sins he will wash away all your
[2:22:32] sin he doesn't matter whether he feel it
[2:22:34] or not his word says so he will was away
[2:22:38] all your and then he will put the
[2:22:42] roofing will put a
[2:22:44] roofing what is the roofing
[2:22:47] the Holy Ghost he says you shall receive
[2:22:50] the gift of the Holy
[2:22:53] Spirit but the Liars of
[2:22:56] today the members and ministers in the
[2:22:59] lam
[2:23:01] church what do they say they say you
[2:23:04] don't need water
[2:23:07] baptism you don't need
[2:23:10] repentance all you need is to accept
[2:23:13] that Jesus died for
[2:23:15] you what have they done
[2:23:18] they have simply told you you accept and
[2:23:20] then they said you don't need to
[2:23:24] accept if you accept that Jesus died for
[2:23:27] you then you have to repent of your
[2:23:30] sins and if you repent of your sins you
[2:23:34] have to show your
[2:23:36] faith by your works by being baptized in
[2:23:40] much water in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:23:44] what is that it is the foundation of the
[2:23:46] church
[2:23:48] the church is a
[2:23:50] building but what have they done they
[2:23:53] have taken their
[2:23:55] foundation and they have kicked it
[2:23:57] away and then they are still
[2:24:00] preaching let me ask you a question if
[2:24:03] they're
[2:24:04] preaching and they not preaching what
[2:24:06] the Bible
[2:24:07] says who sent
[2:24:10] them who called them where do they get
[2:24:13] their
[2:24:15] Authority can can we find
[2:24:18] out can we find
[2:24:21] out let me quick pick the scripture
[2:24:23] right quick here
[2:24:25] now the Bible
[2:24:28] says the Devil
[2:24:30] Himself has made himself the angel of
[2:24:35] Light second
[2:24:38] Corinthians chapter 2
[2:24:42] 11 praise God quickly now this is just
[2:24:46] an addition
[2:24:50] for such are false Apostles deceitful
[2:24:54] workers transforming themselves into the
[2:24:57] Apostles of
[2:24:59] Christ chapter read verse 13
[2:25:10] [Music]
[2:25:15] chap those are the false
[2:25:19] Apostles it doesn't matter whether I
[2:25:21] call myself
[2:25:24] apost but if I tell you you don't need
[2:25:27] water
[2:25:29] baptism it means I am a false
[2:25:32] apost if I tell you you don't need to be
[2:25:34] baptized in the name of Jesus
[2:25:37] Christ then I'm a false Apostle and we
[2:25:40] have many of them
[2:25:42] today and they have
[2:25:45] transformed themselves
[2:25:48] into the Apostles of
[2:25:50] Christ and he says no Marvel for sat
[2:25:52] himself is transformed into the Ang of
[2:26:00] light therefore if no great thing it is
[2:26:03] no good thing if his ministers also be
[2:26:05] transformed as the Ministers of
[2:26:06] righteousness whose end shall be
[2:26:07] according to their
[2:26:15] works
[2:26:19] are you hearing church I wonder whether
[2:26:22] you are
[2:26:24] hearing in

[2:30:03] Germany brother Pastor told
[2:30:06] me and I was we with brother
[2:30:09] Tim the Brut and brother garden and then
[2:30:12] he said this well he knew I was from

[2:30:45] it is a VI
[2:30:47] Society ra Our
[2:30:49] Generation with the fear of
[2:30:52] God and then after we we had our

[2:55:07] sin he convicts you of
[2:55:11] sin we talked about this on Wednesday

[2:55:20] that our
[2:55:22] works it is not our
[2:55:26] works his Works in
[2:55:30] us when we say he works not
[2:55:34] ours we mean the Holy
[2:55:37] Spirit follow me closely now me the Holy
[2:55:41] Spirit comes into your heart
[2:55:44] [Music]
[2:55:47] and when when he
[2:55:49] comes he starts a certain work in your
[2:55:54] life he begins to convince
[2:55:58] you while he's brooding over
[2:56:01] you and he convicts your
[2:56:05] heart and shows you every sin in
[2:56:10] your and you begin to feel how sinful
[2:56:12] you are
[2:56:15] oh
[2:56:16] God oh God I'm a
[2:56:19] sinner I don't deserve your
[2:56:22] grace that's a
[2:56:26] conviction and do you know what it
[2:56:28] does it brings
[2:56:31] hatred in your heart to that
[2:56:35] sin if you're telling lies if you're
[2:56:39] living
[2:56:40] immorally stealing if you are you know
[2:56:43] into these things of the world
[2:56:45] he begins to conv
[2:56:48] you to brood over
[2:56:50] you and reveal these things
[2:56:53] to I've seen people literally in the
[2:56:56] church removing
[2:56:59] earrings never wearing them
[2:57:02] again yet I did not talk about it at
[2:57:07] all what was that was the Holy
[2:57:10] Spirit making it real to them
[2:57:15] bringing them from the level of
[2:57:20] coldness putting a
[2:57:23] fire within their
[2:57:25] hearts for
[2:57:28] God and you begin to H
[2:57:31] sin you get a new
[2:57:34] mind you get a new
[2:57:39] resolve you get you know a
[2:57:42] power and and that is the
[2:57:45] power that overcomes the
[2:57:50] world if you are tied up with these
[2:57:54] things in this sinful
[2:57:57] life you don't need to be told to leave
[2:58:01] it if I tell you to leave it you will
[2:58:03] leave
[2:58:05] it but you are not
[2:58:10] saved
[2:58:12] salvation I wish you
[2:58:17] comes by
[2:58:21] ation a conviction comes by hearing the
[2:58:26] word when you hear the and the Holy
[2:58:29] Spirit comes down he begins to brood
[2:58:32] over you and you feel
[2:58:38] a that's where many people you see they
[2:58:41] begin to
[2:58:42] cry you know
[2:58:45] helplessly
[2:58:47] helplessly they don't care about
[2:58:49] anything they in that
[2:58:51] presence the Holy Spirit shows
[2:58:54] them the the brutal nature of the
[2:58:59] sin is capturing them the holy spirit
[2:59:02] makes it real to
[2:59:03] you you don't need any more to walk as a
[2:59:06] l one
[2:59:09] believer he reveals to you what that sin
[2:59:13] is going to do to
[2:59:16] you he creates in
[2:59:19] you a
[2:59:21] hatred for that sin you begin to have
[2:59:25] you know you begin to Lo
[2:59:29] it to despise
[2:59:31] it and then you are left
[2:59:34] helpless you're like oh what am I going
[2:59:36] to
[2:59:38] do one time happened to
[2:59:40] Isaiah
[2:59:42] said
[2:59:44] God I'm a man of
[2:59:48] uncan he did not say God if I have unle
[2:59:53] lips me he knew by a conviction of
[2:59:59] the when he came before God God told him
[3:00:02] what nature of man he
[3:00:04] was like that man that
[3:00:07] saw you know was he went before
[3:00:11] God and when he reached there that milky
[3:00:14] presence of the Holy
[3:00:16] Ghost he says even the little sin he had
[3:00:21] done lie he had
[3:00:24] told it was all big and
[3:00:28] magnified in the presence of that
[3:00:31] light that light can come here right
[3:00:34] now and when it
[3:00:36] does that's the conviction you
[3:00:40] need you will not cry because of emotion
[3:00:44] you will not weep because of
[3:00:46] emotion but it will be out of a
[3:00:50] conviction say oh
[3:00:52] God I'm a
[3:00:55] sinner I'm a
[3:00:57] man of unclean
[3:01:00] lips he says I am
[3:01:03] undone when that happens to you it's
[3:01:06] like God giving you
[3:01:08] judgment it's like as if youve already
[3:01:10] gone to
[3:01:11] hell I'm
[3:01:14] my Cas is already
[3:01:17] judged you know what the feeling it is
[3:01:20] to be before a
[3:01:22] judge of the highest
[3:01:25] court and that after him there is no
[3:01:29] other
[3:01:30] court that's how you will feel you feel
[3:01:33] like I've sin I'm undone I'm
[3:01:37] finished and when the prophet felt that
[3:01:40] way prophet
[3:01:42] Isaiah cried out he said
[3:01:50] I'm oh
[3:01:52] God and he was
[3:01:55] helpless he became completely
[3:01:58] helpless but in that
[3:02:02] presence that's where God wants all of
[3:02:04] us to
[3:02:07] go you see no matter what you you're
[3:02:10] doing in your
[3:02:12] life God wants you to come to that
[3:02:17] conv many people when they caught doing
[3:02:19] something
[3:02:22] wrong they begin to
[3:02:24] apologize I'm sorry but after that they
[3:02:28] continue
[3:02:29] doing because they did not have a
[3:02:33] conviction and if you don't have a
[3:02:36] conviction you canot be
[3:02:39] saved even if you do the good
[3:02:42] things
[3:02:45] what we need church is a
[3:02:48] conviction when you receive that
[3:02:50] conviction
[3:02:51] in it's a genuine
[3:02:56] repentance the Holy Spirit reveals to
[3:02:58] you everything you have
[3:03:01] done you don't come to him and say Lord
[3:03:03] if I have
[3:03:05] done
[3:03:07] Lord here is what I've done I'm a liar
[3:03:12] I'm a thief
[3:03:14] forgive me wash me me make
[3:03:20] me and you it will bring through
[3:03:24] repentance repentance means you turn
[3:03:27] away from your
[3:03:29] sin you cannot go back to
[3:03:33] it why because when you truly
[3:03:38] repent you receive the Holy
[3:03:42] Spirit
[3:03:45] your
[3:03:46] soul now that Holy
[3:03:49] Spirit is a power that controls
[3:03:53] you and pulls you away from sin each
[3:03:59] time you want to tell a
[3:04:03] lie he will zip your
[3:04:07] mouth
[3:04:10] uh selfcontrol
[3:04:14] comes from the Holy
[3:04:18] Spirit see this is what we need because
[3:04:21] because we do not have a a genuine
[3:04:27] conviction we have a lot of loc
[3:04:34] Believers can we please stand on our
[3:04:38] feet
[3:04:42] God
[3:04:55] when you are
[3:04:57] saved God gives you Faith to rise from
[3:04:59] The Mark of the
[3:05:03] earth your faith overcomes the things of
[3:05:06] the
