[26:25] &gt;&gt; Happy to see each one of you.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; As we are still standing, let's open the
[26:31] book of Isaiah chapter 14.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 14:24
[26:52] The Lord of hosts hath sworn, saying,
[26:56] "Surely, as I have thought, so shall it
[26:59] come to pass, and as I have purposed, so
[27:04] shall it stand."
[27:06] Hallelujah. You may be seated.
[27:10] [snorts]
[27:28] Amen. Amen.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; Let's pray again. Lord, heavenly father,
[27:35] we approach your throne of grace
[27:38] humbly in your presence.
[27:42] May you father hear our needs.
[27:45] Each one of us has come with their
[27:47] needs.
[27:50] May Lord speak to our hearts.
[27:53] May you design our hearts father
[27:56] and Lord we pray that may you strengthen
[27:59] us.
[28:02] Use me Lord. I'm just a vessel
[28:07] in the in the precious name of Lord
[28:08] Jesus.
[28:11] Amen. Amen.
[28:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; As you're seated, you can open the book
[28:15] of Romans chapter 8.
[28:21] &gt;&gt; Romans 8, chapter 28.
[28:30] It says that and we know that all things
[28:34] work together for good to them that love
[28:37] God. to them who are are the called
[28:41] according to his purpose. Hallelujah.
[29:09] Hallelujah.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[29:14] &gt;&gt; Once again, I'm happy to be here.
[29:18] Thank you for those that pray for the
[29:20] ministers
[29:23] because it's not easy when you're going
[29:25] to minister.
[29:28] get something to talk about.
[29:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[29:33] &gt;&gt; I love you each one of you.
[29:38] I request for your uned attention please
[29:42] as you know I go slow
[29:47] that we get something that the Lord is.
[29:52] So today I'm going to talk about uh no
[29:55] credit to the devil
[30:06] or I don't know if that's the right to
[30:09] the devil
[30:12] any glory for him.
[30:15] [clears throat]
[30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:19] And once again we can read that book of
[30:22] Isaiah
[30:23] to me. What would
[30:26] &gt;&gt; the Lord of hosts
[30:28] hath sworn saying surely as I have
[30:32] thought so shall it come to pass and as
[30:36] I've purposed so shall it stand.
[30:38] Hallelujah. [snorts]
[30:56] Hallelujah.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:58] You know it's a blessing always to
[31:00] minister in any way
[31:06] as I always say whether playing
[31:11] any instrument
[31:14] in any way
[31:17] as you still alive
[31:19] it's a blessing
[31:21] and I thank pastor who gave me this
[31:22] opportunity also to stand
[31:27] and pray for me that the Lord will bring
[31:28] out what he what he gave me.
[31:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; So we have seen Isaiah here is saying
[31:41] that the Lord has thought something.
[31:48] So shall it come to pass
[31:52] regardless what may come.
[31:57] Do you believe the word of God?
[32:00] Hallelujah. As long as God has thought
[32:02] about it
[32:04] in the beginning
[32:07] can stop it.
[32:10] And then he goes ahead and he said, "And
[32:12] as I have purposed, so shall it stand."
[32:21] And the prophet say that there is no
[32:25] enough demons
[32:29] in hell
[32:31] wherever
[32:33] that can stand before the purpose of
[32:35] God.
[32:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[32:41] But now remember there is something that
[32:43] I want us to see here
[32:46] that this Bible
[32:49] it is not written for everyone.
[32:53] Every scripture that we read is not for
[32:55] everyone.
[32:58] So this prophecy goes to a specific
[33:01] category of people
[33:07] and that's we see that's the seed of
[33:08] Abraham.
[33:12] Hallelujah.
[33:13] Are you one of them?
[33:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says by faith
[33:19] we are made
[33:22] &gt;&gt; the children of Abra.
[33:24] Hallelujah.
[33:25] &gt;&gt; So, Romans 8:2 says,
[33:30] "And we know that all things work
[33:32] together for good to them that love
[33:36] God."
[33:41] So, here also Paul is addressing to that
[33:43] category of people.
[33:47] He's saying that that to them that love
[33:50] God,
[33:52] to them who are called according to his
[33:55] purpose.
[33:59] Before the time began, God of glory
[34:01] Jehovah had a great purpose,
[34:08] a very big purpose.
[34:12] But this purpose
[34:15] it is there are people
[34:18] who are attached to that purpose.
[34:23] Hallelujah. When when brother Brham was
[34:26] preaching
[34:28] from his ministry throughout
[34:32] Hebrews 138 was his theme.
[34:40] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today.
[34:46] Why? Because that was the great purpose
[34:48] of God
[34:52] that he had even before the time began.
[34:56] Hallelujah.
[34:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[34:58] &gt;&gt; And Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[35:04] that is uh Jesus Christ.
[35:10] the lamb of God.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; And then today
[35:16] the prophet say that in Christ is the
[35:19] mystery of God revealed.
[35:22] The prophet says that today he's in the
[35:26] bride.
[35:29] Hallelujah.
[35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yesterday Jesus Christ.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Today the bride.
[35:36] Amen.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; Tomorrow.
[35:39] or forever.
[35:41] &gt;&gt; It is the marriage that [snorts]
[35:44] mean that yesterday it was the Old
[35:46] Testament.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Today it's the New Testament
[35:51] and then tomorrow the Old Testament is
[35:52] getting married to the New Testament.
[35:59] So there is that great purpose that God
[36:02] had
[36:05] and as you have seen that purpose cannot
[36:07] be fulfilled.
[36:10] Unless there is this certain group of
[36:12] people
[36:15] that has come in the picture.
[36:18] Hallelujah. That's why the Bible is
[36:20] written
[36:21] not for everyone
[36:23] but though many read it
[36:26] but it is for that specific group.
[36:33] It's a mystery
[36:35] that God
[36:38] The great Jehovah
[36:40] &gt;&gt; is seeking for a wife.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Of which the wife is already there
[36:48] because the wife she hath made herself
[36:51] ready.
[36:56] So my heading say that no credit to the
[36:58] devil
[37:03] and this and this spec this specifically
[37:06] goes to that group of people
[37:12] of which I believe we are.
[37:17] Amen.
[37:17] &gt;&gt; Now I want you to first see the
[37:20] the position of of this these people. So
[37:30] in the church ages, the sadistician
[37:32] church age say that
[37:36] they already have eternal life
[37:41] and cannot come into the judgment.
[37:46] Hallelujah. Amen.
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Have you had already have a turn?
[37:52] Amen. 2 Corinthians 5:
[37:58] For we know that if our earthly house of
[38:00] this tabernacle were dissolved,
[38:07] we have a building of God
[38:11] and house not made with hands,
[38:15] eternal in heaven.
[38:19] I wish I had time to go in detail.
[38:24] Because this goes back to the tabernacle
[38:26] of Moses.
[38:30] Tabernacle Moses, the temple of Solomon,
[38:33] tabernacle of David.
[38:36] And then God promised to restore the
[38:38] tabernacle of David.
[38:42] I wish I had time. But here Paul is
[38:45] saying that there is another house in
[38:47] heaven.
[38:52] eternal in the heaven.
[38:56] The prophet say that something eternal,
[39:00] it is something that has no beginning
[39:05] and has no end.
[39:09] So we the children of God here,
[39:12] the seed of Abraham, our hope
[39:16] is that house that we're talking about.
[39:19] Hallelujah.
[39:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; And if that that house and then the
[39:23] prophecy that that house is the real me
[39:28] you
[39:30] &gt;&gt; the real you
[39:32] &gt;&gt; because here we are negatives
[39:35] in the shadows of ourselves.
[39:39] Yeah. Pastor preached about the the the
[39:43] true our true origin.
[39:47] Hallelujah.
[39:48] And and here if if these bodies or if
[39:53] these tabernacles are eternal,
[39:59] it means that the bride of Jesus Christ
[40:00] is eternal.
[40:03] Meaning we have no beginning.
[40:07] Amen. Neither do we have an end.
[40:11] So there are only two things that have
[40:13] no beginning.
[40:18] That is God
[40:20] and his bride.
[40:22] They have no beginning
[40:24] and they have no end
[40:28] which make one.
[40:32] So
[40:35] the devil has a beginning
[40:38] and he has an end
[40:42] because the Bible says that he has but a
[40:44] short time.
[40:47] mainly in this age that we are living
[40:48] in.
[40:51] That's why this age is called uh it's
[40:53] called the evil age.
[40:57] And that's why the devil has become the
[40:59] god of it.
[41:03] Why? Because he knows he has but a
[41:06] short.
[41:10] And the Bible says that all hell
[41:14] powered out.
[41:17] There's no demon in hell doing what?
[41:21] They don't have any time.
[41:24] They are right here.
[41:27] Right here where we are.
[41:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:31] &gt;&gt; They don't have time to sleep.
[41:35] They know they have but a short time.
[41:40] I want God to give me grace this
[41:41] evening.
[41:44] I expose the devil.
[41:46] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. See something.
[41:50] But now this message goes exactly that
[41:53] group of
[41:57] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[41:58] &gt;&gt; Let's open Romans chapter 9
[42:02] verse 11.
[42:07] It says that for the children being not
[42:09] yet born, neither having done any good
[42:12] or evil, that the purpose of God
[42:15] according to election might stand,
[42:19] &gt;&gt; not of works, but of him that calleth.
[42:22] Amen.
[42:41] Hallelujah.
[42:43] &gt;&gt; So we see here that Paul is saying that
[42:46] before the children being yet born
[42:52] having done any good or evil
[42:55] mean that the child can be born
[42:59] they can do good and evil.
[43:01] Hallelujah.
[43:03] Now here specifically specific he was
[43:07] talking about Jacob and
[43:13] Hallelujah and if the bride of Jesus
[43:17] Christ she's eternal
[43:24] meaning she has no beginning
[43:27] there is somewhere where she come from
[43:30] you see so it means
[43:33] that God
[43:35] now that's when our predestination comes
[43:37] in
[43:41] that God prepared
[43:45] predestinated
[43:48] and he has a movie
[43:52] of this person
[43:54] not for everyone
[43:56] but of this specific
[43:59] he has everything
[44:02] Okay, because this is his bride.
[44:05] First of all, you have to understand the
[44:07] position of this person.
[44:10] You know what is giving us a hard time,
[44:14] it is because we have not yet understood
[44:17] who we are.
[44:21] That's why the Bible say that if the
[44:24] bride understands who she is,
[44:28] my my my
[44:31] can finish the
[44:34] but here I want us to look at Jacob and
[44:35] Esau
[44:38] like Jeremiah
[44:41] before you were born
[44:44] before you even formed
[44:47] I knew you.
[44:50] So meaning it goes way back
[44:54] even the marriage of the of his parents
[45:00] even the marriage of the grandmothers.
[45:06] So God had everything
[45:10] pre-planned.
[45:13] He thought about everything
[45:16] and he hath swn
[45:20] and passed
[45:23] for it to stand that it shall pass.
[45:27] Hallelujah.
[45:28] &gt;&gt; And that's why actually when it comes to
[45:31] marriage,
[45:33] things become tight.
[45:37] God is serious about it
[45:41] and the devil is also fighting.
[45:45] But it is a great thing than than we
[45:47] think.
[45:50] It's a very big thing
[45:53] because but now it's a big thing mainly
[45:57] only to that group of people.
[46:02] That's why the Bible say that he that
[46:04] obtainth
[46:05] he that findeth a good wife
[46:10] obtainth favor of the Lord.
[46:15] Not everyone.
[46:17] It is only to the bride.
[46:20] The rest you can marry the way you want.
[46:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; I want us first understand the position
[46:27] of of this bride then we can continue.
[46:33] If you look carefully,
[46:36] Jacob was a very good boy at home.
[46:41] Was a worker
[46:43] hardworking than
[46:46] sorry rather
[46:51] than Jacob
[46:54] is the one that could take care of his
[46:56] father.
[46:59] Do this and that.
[47:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[47:03] &gt;&gt; And Jacob to begin with, even his name
[47:06] was a bad one.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; To begin with,
[47:15] Esau came first.
[47:17] Meaning he was leading. He was taking a
[47:19] lead.
[47:22] Meaning that the birthight is his.
[47:26] Okay.
[47:28] But how did it end?
[47:31] We see that Jacob
[47:34] took over the end.
[47:37] Why?
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Because God had a movie,
[47:41] God had planned.
[47:44] Hallelujah. Regardless whether Jacob had
[47:46] had done wrong
[47:50] or he had sinned to what extent,
[47:54] but is he of that seed?
[47:59] Is he of that group?
[48:03] That's what matters.
[48:05] Regardless of what,
[48:08] regardless of how many demons that
[48:09] comes.
[48:12] Hallelujah.
[48:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[48:13] &gt;&gt; The purpose of God shall stand.
[48:17] Amen. Let's take a look at
[48:22] a priest.
[48:25] Meaning to be a high priest
[48:28] means you have to be a very godly man,
[48:33] a good person,
[48:36] a good person in the society,
[48:39] a person that does good things.
[48:42] And I want us to type
[48:45] with the thief on the cross.
[48:51] The thief on the cross.
[48:53] God had his movie.
[48:57] Why? Not because he was good,
[49:01] but because he was a tongue.
[49:05] He came from somewhere.
[49:07] He's a part of the great purpose of God.
[49:12] So regardless of what you have done,
[49:17] first stop there.
[49:19] Romans 8.
[49:21] 28 say, "And we know all things work
[49:25] together
[49:27] for good them that love God
[49:32] to them who are the called according
[49:36] to his purpose."
[49:39] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. So everything
[49:42] works together for good.
[49:45] Even if it's bad, how how much ugly it
[49:49] looks
[49:51] But if you are of th those people,
[49:57] God turns it.
[49:59] There is a filter
[50:02] that whether good or bad.
[50:04] It will have to be good.
[50:09] And let me tell you
[50:11] this bride,
[50:13] God trusts her a lot.
[50:18] &gt;&gt; And we are in the age
[50:20] where
[50:22] she's coming to the full adoption
[50:27] meaning
[50:29] she can have the same authority as the
[50:32] son.
[50:35] Hallelujah. Because these two people
[50:39] they are eternal.
[50:41] They came from somewhere.
[50:44] You you you didn't just come to
[50:46] existence when you were born.
[50:51] You were there before time began.
[50:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[50:57] &gt;&gt; Only that like how Haga says
[51:01] that we are sealed in these houses.
[51:07] We are sealed.
[51:10] So sometimes it's hard to, you know,
[51:14] it's like a baby in the mother's womb.
[51:17] She's sealed within that.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[51:23] &gt;&gt; So at some point she can see some light
[51:26] through and see
[51:30] and see as if there is a world somewhere
[51:36] that is better than where I am.
[51:41] So even if you send preachers there in
[51:43] the womb
[51:46] and they preach this baby
[51:50] from morning to evening that there is a
[51:52] world
[51:54] where you can run and no sleep
[51:59] where you can stretch and
[52:03] it takes faith for this child to
[52:05] believe. [laughter]
[52:10] Are you for real
[52:13] that world? [clears throat]
[52:16] So do you believe that we in the womb?
[52:20] That's what hagger says.
[52:23] We are sealed
[52:25] in these houses in this tabernacle.
[52:29] So at some point sometimes God gives us
[52:33] grace
[52:35] and you see through just a small light.
[52:41] and you can penetrate and see.
[52:44] Hallelujah.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:48] So, so everything works together for
[52:50] good.
[52:52] So, this thief on the cross,
[52:56] he had to be a thief for him to be
[52:57] saved. Hallelujah.
[53:03] We had to break people's houses,
[53:07] people's homes
[53:10] regardless,
[53:12] &gt;&gt; but nothing was shocking God. Hey,
[53:24] God had a film already.
[53:28] And let me tell you this, God watched
[53:31] your movie.
[53:33] He first played it very well and he
[53:35] watched it
[53:38] even before he created Adam.
[53:43] Hallelujah.
[53:44] So we see that if if this thief didn't
[53:47] go and steal and do these wrong things,
[53:54] he would have missed the cross.
[53:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[54:00] &gt;&gt; So you understand
[54:02] that when the scripture say that
[54:04] everything works together
[54:08] and is for a certain group of people
[54:13] because we see that there was another
[54:14] thief on the cross.
[54:18] There was another thief.
[54:21] So whatever befall him,
[54:25] God doesn't care.
[54:28] God only cares for his own.
[54:32] Hallelujah. That's why the book of
[54:33] Revelation says
[54:36] that four angels stretching forth
[54:42] the corners of the of the of the world
[54:46] holding the winds.
[54:49] Why? Because of the elect. Hallelujah.
[54:53] &gt;&gt; But once the elect is out,
[54:57] Whatever happens to them,
[55:00] God doesn't care.
[55:04] Okay? Hallelujah.
[55:05] &gt;&gt; And now you understand why the prophet
[55:06] says
[55:08] that a man that is not born again.
[55:12] There's not any difference with the
[55:13] beast.
[55:16] Why? Why did he say the beast?
[55:20] Because of the serpent.
[55:23] The serpent was the beast.
[55:26] Okay. So the only hope that we have
[55:31] what excites our heart
[55:34] it is because we didn't just start from
[55:36] Edel.
[55:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Way back.
[55:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[55:47] And
[55:49] he he was a good person
[55:52] but he missed it.
[55:55] Hallelujah.
[55:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:57] &gt;&gt; All things works together for good.
[56:00] &gt;&gt; Let us first look at Rachel's trouble.
[56:07] Rachel, Jacob's
[56:12] Jacob's wife.
[56:16] He said that Genesis chapter 20 29 years
[56:28] Verse 31,
[56:37] &gt;&gt; it says that and when the Lord saw that
[56:40] Leah was hated,
[56:43] he opened her womb, but Rachel was
[56:47] barren.
[56:55] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know the
[56:57] story very well.
[57:00] Rachel
[57:02] is not that Jacob beloved.
[57:05] She was the wife.
[57:08] So Leah was by the way.
[57:13] That's why you see even later on
[57:17] the prophet comes and say
[57:20] that there is a voice
[57:22] in Rama,
[57:25] a cry,
[57:27] &gt;&gt; lamentation.
[57:29] Rachel weeping for her children,
[57:33] not Leah.
[57:34] Okay. Now, I want you to see here
[57:37] something
[57:39] that Rachel,
[57:42] he was, let's say, like her future was
[57:44] bright.
[57:48] Okay. M
[57:49] &gt;&gt; because they are married even if they
[57:51] are two
[57:54] she's loved
[57:58] and she's a woman with the right
[58:02] hallelujah her husband
[58:05] but now there's something here that
[58:07] happened
[58:09] all of a sudden she became barren
[58:14] and Leah was giving birth
[58:18] So who made her bar?
[58:22] Who has her movie?
[58:26] Is someone with her movie?
[58:28] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; And I want us to understand
[58:34] because now for them
[58:37] it was another day.
[58:40] But for us, we have the light of the
[58:43] message.
[58:46] We are the final people.
[58:50] We are you know the union of the bride.
[58:55] Hallelujah. So for us we are expected
[59:00] to see beyond Rachel
[59:03] to see beyond her.
[59:05] But I want you to imagine just bring it
[59:07] to the normal way of life.
[59:12] First imagine what was going in between
[59:14] those people.
[59:18] You know the Bible says that they they
[59:21] strove
[59:25] they [clears throat] were against each
[59:26] other.
[59:28] Why? Because Leah was giving birth
[59:33] son after son
[59:35] and is not giving birth.
[59:38] So maybe as we're going to see here
[59:42] She was like, "God has forsaken me."
[59:47] But I want to see something.
[59:49] God was watching.
[59:53] And regardless whether good or bad,
[59:57] it has to come out when it's good.
[1:00:02] How much ugly it is.
[1:00:07] So Leah went on gave birth to Rob.
[1:00:12] She was happy.
[1:00:14] She gave birth to Simeon
[1:00:17] Judah
[1:00:18] and so on
[1:00:21] and all the maids were giving birth
[1:00:28] when is not giving birth.
[1:00:31] What is the reason behind it?
[1:00:35] Because now he we
[1:00:37] at the opening of the seals
[1:00:41] we can see what the reason that was
[1:00:42] behind it.
[1:00:46] Who closed her womb?
[1:00:50] Was it God?
[1:00:53] Genesis 30
[1:00:55] verse one.
[1:00:58] Say that. And when Rachel saw
[1:01:01] that she she bear Jacob no children,
[1:01:06] Rachel envied her sister
[1:01:10] and said unto Jacob, "Give me children
[1:01:15] or else I die."
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; This is a very good type.
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; I believe you have ever been in a
[1:01:26] situation
[1:01:28] or maybe there is someone that is going
[1:01:30] through a situation.
[1:01:32] Have you ever been somewhere
[1:01:34] and you feel like
[1:01:37] I wish I can leave this world?
[1:01:40] I wish I can just rest.
[1:01:44] Because you see when everything is just
[1:01:46] against you,
[1:01:49] I want to understand what Rachel was
[1:01:51] facing.
[1:01:53] It was something that you can't just
[1:01:55] handle.
[1:01:58] It was something that you can't just
[1:02:00] handle.
[1:02:02] First of all, she was embarrassed before
[1:02:04] people.
[1:02:06] She was losing her husband. Maybe
[1:02:12] maybe she was going through depression,
[1:02:15] maybe people talking about her
[1:02:18] until she had to face Jacob,
[1:02:22] her pastor,
[1:02:24] telling him
[1:02:27] that if I don't see the fruits
[1:02:33] or else I die.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Listen what Jacob replied.
[1:02:40] And Jacob's anger was kind of
[1:02:44] against Rachel.
[1:02:47] And he said, "A mine God stayed
[1:02:52] hath withheld from thee the fruit of of
[1:02:55] the womb."
[1:03:00] So Jacob
[1:03:02] as a prophet
[1:03:05] he could see
[1:03:08] that this is God's doing.
[1:03:11] Hallelujah. So it it is God from the
[1:03:15] beginning that
[1:03:18] closed.
[1:03:20] So everything
[1:03:22] there is a reason behind it
[1:03:26] to them
[1:03:27] that accord.
[1:03:30] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; So she stressed the man of God
[1:03:38] until the man of God of God became
[1:03:40] angry.
[1:03:43] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Maybe some
[1:03:44] situation has happened in your life
[1:03:48] and maybe pastor
[1:03:50] pastor something is not going well.
[1:03:54] Something is not moving. Something's not
[1:03:56] happening.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:02] Are you the seed of Abraham?
[1:04:05] Someone has your movie.
[1:04:08] Hallelujah.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; There's someone having your movie.
[1:04:12] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Uh let's first look at this God's great
[1:04:17] purpose.
[1:04:22] You can jump the same chapter 30
[1:04:27] to
[1:04:30] 22nd verse.
[1:04:36] Now and God remembered Rachel
[1:04:40] and God hearkened to her.
[1:04:44] and opened H.
[1:04:47] So he's the one that closed it.
[1:04:51] Why is he opening this?
[1:04:55] And the Bible say that God unto Rachel.
[1:05:00] It means that Rachel was crying day and
[1:05:03] night.
[1:05:06] She was on her knees crying.
[1:05:10] I want us first understand these times
[1:05:14] and season when God opened her womb.
[1:05:20] This is when Jacob had 10 sons.
[1:05:28] It's funny when you can't ask any
[1:05:30] denomination
[1:05:34] why did God close riches womb
[1:05:38] and they answer you
[1:05:40] but because of the opening of the se
[1:05:44] and the precious message that we have
[1:05:46] received
[1:05:48] we can run through the Bible from
[1:05:49] Genesis to Revelation.
[1:05:55] Hallelujah.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; I'll give you the reason here.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; Uh 37 chapter 37:3
[1:06:10] says that now Israel loved Joseph
[1:06:17] more than all his children
[1:06:20] because he was the son of this old age.
[1:06:27] and he made him a court of many colors.
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; So the Bible is saying
[1:06:38] the reason why Jacob loved Jacob more
[1:06:41] than all of them.
[1:06:46] It is because
[1:06:48] Jacob was of old age.
[1:06:54] So there is a hidden love in Jacob,
[1:07:00] a different kind of love
[1:07:03] that had to be expressed at his
[1:07:05] audience.
[1:07:08] So when you look at the scenario of
[1:07:10] Rachel
[1:07:12] and Leah, it looks like Leah was winning
[1:07:18] and Rachel everything is fake.
[1:07:23] Hallelujah.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:07:26] &gt;&gt; But because she was the seed of God,
[1:07:31] &gt;&gt; because she's the people that I'm
[1:07:32] talking about,
[1:07:36] everything had to come out good.
[1:07:44] So I want you to imagine if Joseph came
[1:07:46] first
[1:07:50] in the position of Robin.
[1:07:55] meaning that the father would have not
[1:07:57] loved him
[1:07:59] to this extent
[1:08:02] and also meaning that
[1:08:04] they would have not sold him.
[1:08:08] Okay. And this is part of God's great
[1:08:12] purpose.
[1:08:16] My brother can give me this. So Joseph
[1:08:21] was the 11th,
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; okay?
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; At the time
[1:08:29] when his father was old
[1:08:33] and
[1:08:35] for for this kind of love
[1:08:39] that was hidden in Jacob
[1:08:42] to be expressed
[1:08:45] and I I think now you can see where I'm
[1:08:47] going, right?
[1:08:50] Hallelujah. Are we together? Hallelujah.
[1:08:53] Are we together?
[1:08:55] Are we there?
[1:08:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; So,
[1:09:00] &gt;&gt; Joseph was the 11th
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; from Robin.
[1:09:05] Hallelujah.
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; At the time when God opened the womb of
[1:09:11] Rachel,
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; this is the time when Jacob was of old
[1:09:15] age.
[1:09:19] Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:09:20] &gt;&gt; When he has gray white hair.
[1:09:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There is a such kind of love
[1:09:27] that was hidden
[1:09:30] that was to be expressed at the 11th
[1:09:32] son.
[1:09:36] Praise the Lord.
[1:09:38] So here here the prophet comes and says
[1:09:42] we the bride the bride age here
[1:09:47] we are the 11th hour bride.
[1:09:51] And you see Jesus gave this parable in
[1:09:54] Matthew
[1:09:57] of the workers that were working in the
[1:10:00] vine.
[1:10:03] And when he came to the 11th hour
[1:10:06] workers
[1:10:09] They came and they worked just for one
[1:10:12] house.
[1:10:15] Hallelujah. Just one house. And then the
[1:10:17] prophet in the opening, I mean in the
[1:10:19] preaching of church ages,
[1:10:22] he says.
[1:10:25] Uh he says that
[1:10:28] is the shortest time
[1:10:31] is the shortest work.
[1:10:35] Quick work.
[1:10:37] just one hour. Hallelujah.
[1:10:39] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; And here the Bible says in the book of
[1:10:42] Matthew 24, you read
[1:10:46] that they all receive the same pay,
[1:10:51] even those that were hit by the heat of
[1:10:54] the day
[1:10:57] since morning. And then this the 11th
[1:11:00] hour worker came in
[1:11:04] and they just finished.
[1:11:07] They finish with the cap stone.
[1:11:11] Praise the Lord. Amen. And they were
[1:11:13] given the same.
[1:11:16] And then the prophet says because the
[1:11:18] Bible says that they were given the same
[1:11:20] penny.
[1:11:23] And the prophet say this penny
[1:11:27] it is the same Holy Ghost.
[1:11:30] It is the same salvation.
[1:11:33] And that's why we need to be restored
[1:11:34] back.
[1:11:37] And that's why we need the prophet.
[1:11:42] This is Revelation 10.
[1:11:45] Hallelujah.
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; Where the night angels descended.
[1:11:50] The seven angels in constellation
[1:11:53] and they formed this.
[1:11:56] Okay. It's a it's a supernatural image
[1:12:03] testifying the reason why God closed the
[1:12:05] womb of
[1:12:09] such that Joseph
[1:12:11] had to come to at a specific time
[1:12:17] at an evening hour
[1:12:20] where this love
[1:12:22] perfect love the capstone
[1:12:26] will be expressed. for us.
[1:12:28] Hallelujah.
[1:12:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; Now we see
[1:12:32] also that because that his father loved
[1:12:35] him so much
[1:12:38] he gave him coat of many colors.
[1:12:43] And this quot of many colors
[1:12:47] well I will not go there.
[1:12:50] Let me just my line here.
[1:12:53] It was meaning something.
[1:12:56] Now let us look at something here
[1:13:01] in the message the masterpiece
[1:13:06] uh paragraph 62
[1:13:09] and now Abraham was the foundation of
[1:13:11] faith
[1:13:16] let's say it had four foundations
[1:13:20] the foundation of faith was Abraham
[1:13:24] the foundation of love was Isaac.
[1:13:28] The foundation of grace was Jacob.
[1:13:32] God's grace to Jacob.
[1:13:35] Anyone knows that.
[1:13:37] But in Joseph
[1:13:40] was perfection.
[1:13:43] Joseph was perfection.
[1:13:48] Hallelujah. [snorts]
[1:13:49] Hallelujah.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; And Joseph was typing Christ.
[1:13:53] Do you believe that he was typing
[1:13:56] Christ?
[1:14:00] John 12:24.
[1:14:03] He said that Jesus is the corn of wheat.
[1:14:09] He is that corn of wheat.
[1:14:12] Say that verily verily I say
[1:14:16] except a corn of wheat fall into the
[1:14:19] ground
[1:14:23] it abideth alone
[1:14:26] but if it die
[1:14:28] it bringeth forth much fruit.
[1:14:32] So Jesus who is Joseph
[1:14:37] he is that corner of it.
[1:14:40] So he had to fall down in the
[1:14:42] [clears throat] intera
[1:14:49] meaning that Jesus is that corn of
[1:14:52] wheat.
[1:14:54] So is the bride.
[1:14:56] She's also a wheat. Okay.
[1:15:01] Song of Solomon chapter 4
[1:15:04] verse seven.
[1:15:06] Thou at all fair, my love,
[1:15:11] there is no spot in thee.
[1:15:15] You see,
[1:15:17] Joseph was perfect.
[1:15:21] Perfection.
[1:15:24] And here
[1:15:26] God is telling her bride
[1:15:29] that she she's perfect.
[1:15:32] And the Bible says that God is taking a
[1:15:35] church without spot or ring.
[1:15:40] Without spot or wrinkle
[1:15:43] does not mean a righteous bunch of
[1:15:45] people
[1:15:48] who have done nothing wrong.
[1:15:51] No, it means the people that existed
[1:15:56] before
[1:15:59] time began.
[1:16:00] It means the people of his name.
[1:16:06] It means the people whom God have their
[1:16:09] movie.
[1:16:13] So if God has your moving,
[1:16:18] you are lucky
[1:16:20] because everything that happen in your
[1:16:22] life,
[1:16:24] whether good or bad,
[1:16:26] it has to come out good.
[1:16:31] Hallelujah. Now never give the devil a
[1:16:34] credit
[1:16:37] at any point.
[1:16:40] Never regret of what you have gone
[1:16:42] through.
[1:16:44] This is God speaking to you.
[1:16:47] Here is saying in first Corinthians
[1:16:50] chapter 2
[1:16:52] verse seven.
[1:16:54] But we speak the wisdom of God
[1:16:59] mystery.
[1:17:02] Even the hidden wisdom
[1:17:04] which God ordained before the world our
[1:17:08] glory
[1:17:11] which none of the princes of this world
[1:17:13] knew.
[1:17:18] For had they known it,
[1:17:21] they would not have crucified the Lord
[1:17:23] of glory.
[1:17:28] Hallelujah.
[1:17:29] &gt;&gt; So this movie It is only God that has
[1:17:33] it.
[1:17:35] And there's a way how he plays his game
[1:17:40] and he hides it. So it looks like as if
[1:17:43] this is going to happen
[1:17:48] when it is completely different.
[1:17:52] And the reason why he hides it
[1:17:54] because we have our enemy, the
[1:17:57] adversary.
[1:17:59] No, it's okay. We have the enemy of our
[1:18:01] adversary, the devil.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; Now, here is saying that
[1:18:08] we speak the wisdom of God in the
[1:18:10] mystery,
[1:18:13] even the hidden wisdom.
[1:18:17] So behind every happening in your life,
[1:18:24] there is a wisdom of God behind someone.
[1:18:30] In other words, God has a part in it.
[1:18:36] However, ugly ital
[1:18:41] which God ordained before the world and
[1:18:43] to our glory.
[1:18:49] So this wisdom
[1:18:51] was there even before the world began
[1:18:55] behind everything that is going to
[1:18:56] happen.
[1:18:59] Okay.
[1:19:01] Which none of the priests of this world
[1:19:02] knew?
[1:19:06] For had they known,
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; they would not have crucified the Lord.
[1:19:14] Amen. So it looked like as if Jesus's
[1:19:17] ministry has fallen
[1:19:22] to the extent even the disciples
[1:19:23] themselves, they lost hope.
[1:19:28] like as if everything now is gone.
[1:19:32] But I tell you what, this evening,
[1:19:36] never give the devil any credit
[1:19:40] because he has no
[1:19:45] Isaiah said that since from the time he
[1:19:48] fought in heaven,
[1:19:51] he was thrown down.
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; Not only down,
[1:19:56] but in the pits of hell. Meaning that he
[1:20:00] has no single glory.
[1:20:03] He has no credit at all.
[1:20:07] So the prophet say that now he becomes
[1:20:09] our worker.
[1:20:13] He's working for us.
[1:20:16] My brother over there, you can stand.
[1:20:19] I don't want you to miss this one.
[1:20:23] I don't have to miss this one.
[1:20:25] Hallelujah.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; So the devil is our worker.
[1:20:31] That's what the prophet say. He's our
[1:20:34] worker.
[1:20:35] Why? Because already God designed it.
[1:20:41] That everything that comes in bad
[1:20:44] comes out good. Good good.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:51] Now here after understanding this
[1:20:57] what about when people gossip about me?
[1:21:01] What about when you hurt people hurt
[1:21:03] you?
[1:21:05] What about
[1:21:07] they do you really bad?
[1:21:12] Would you praise God?
[1:21:15] Because now remember our difference now
[1:21:17] with Rachel
[1:21:20] for us
[1:21:22] the seals are open.
[1:21:27] We are the 11th hour bride.
[1:21:31] The omega bread.
[1:21:34] Meaning for us we can see beyond her.
[1:21:40] How about when people hurt you? When
[1:21:42] people talk ill about you?
[1:21:46] What will you do? What will you do?
[1:21:49] Will you go to WhatsApp status
[1:21:53] and express your feeling?
[1:21:57] Will you fight back?
[1:22:02] Will you go on Facebook and post them?
[1:22:07] Listen closely.
[1:22:10] If you do such a thing,
[1:22:13] it means that you are young as a baby,
[1:22:18] you don't even understand
[1:22:20] that everything works together.
[1:22:24] In other words, it is hard to do.
[1:22:29] That's why we need we need perfect love.
[1:22:33] But it's hard to do in such
[1:22:34] circumstances. Then you praise the Lord.
[1:22:39] Because you be putting more cos of fire
[1:22:41] on the devil.
[1:22:46] Actually these things
[1:22:49] they be pushing you
[1:22:52] to that great purpose
[1:22:56] because everything you have to know
[1:22:59] if it happens. Have they gossiped about
[1:23:01] me?
[1:23:03] My brother has hurt me.
[1:23:07] First ask yourself,
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; are you the seed of Abraham?
[1:23:11] Then if you're the seed of Abraham,
[1:23:13] then start singing. I'm rejoicing night
[1:23:17] and day.
[1:23:19] As I walk,
[1:23:23] the comforter
[1:23:25] abides with you. Hallelujah. because he
[1:23:28] said that I will never leave you
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; regardless even when you at the lowest
[1:23:40] there is a time when it reaches you feel
[1:23:42] you are cano
[1:23:46] you feel you are discouraged
[1:23:50] even in that state he's there
[1:23:53] he's there watching
[1:23:56] Lord
[1:23:59] Now the devil is powerless.
[1:24:03] It's people that gives him power.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; But I wish you can know the guy we are
[1:24:09] dealing with.
[1:24:12] Hallelujah.
[1:24:14] Well, Isaiah 14:16,
[1:24:19] they that see thee
[1:24:25] shall narrowly look upon thee
[1:24:29] that they not even looking at.
[1:24:36] [laughter] He say that
[1:24:38] saying is this the man
[1:24:43] Oh no, you know that made the earth to
[1:24:46] tremble
[1:24:49] that did shake kingdom.
[1:24:52] Is this the guy? I can't even see him.
[1:24:57] Hallelujah. So this shows us that the
[1:25:00] devil is powerless.
[1:25:07] Hallelujah. So the prophet says that God
[1:25:10] would have finished Lucifer in heaven,
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; but he didn't.
[1:25:18] He threw him in the pits of hell.
[1:25:21] Pits,
[1:25:24] the lowest estate.
[1:25:28] He is the guy
[1:25:31] in the lowest estate ever.
[1:25:39] than even animals
[1:25:43] than even animal.
[1:25:45] And that's why he he has tried his level
[1:25:47] best to pervert the love of God.
[1:25:53] And the more he perverts, it goes into
[1:25:55] filthy.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah. Because he's in the pits of
[1:26:00] hell.
[1:26:02] He's in the lowest estate area.
[1:26:08] So God didn't even waste his time
[1:26:13] because he knew he had he has the 11th
[1:26:16] hour bride
[1:26:20] and he's going to give him the last.
[1:26:24] Hallelujah.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Of course it's it is hard.
[1:26:28] It is hard because people think
[1:26:31] naturally we think that the devil is a
[1:26:33] big guy.
[1:26:37] But he is nothing.
[1:26:40] He's completely nothing.
[1:26:43] I wish God can open our eyes.
[1:26:47] Hallelujah. You cannot worry again.
[1:26:53] And after knowing that you are the seed
[1:26:55] of Abraham,
[1:26:57] my goodness.
[1:27:00] Hallelujah. Is this the guy?
[1:27:04] That made me tremble,
[1:27:08] that made me miss the service,
[1:27:12] that made me fornicate.
[1:27:17] Really, you cannot even identify
[1:27:18] yourself with him.
[1:27:23] Hallelujah.
[1:27:25] The Bible says that the devil is a
[1:27:27] thief.
[1:27:29] The thief cometh not
[1:27:32] but for to steal
[1:27:34] and to kill and to destroy.
[1:27:38] Hallelujah. That is the target
[1:27:42] of the devil. He comes to kill, to
[1:27:46] destroy, to frustrate everyone.
[1:27:50] But look,
[1:27:52] he has no power to destroy.
[1:27:55] He has no power to kill.
[1:28:00] Okay, you have known that
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; it is you
[1:28:06] that gives him that power
[1:28:09] and gives him the chair to sit.
[1:28:15] But look here
[1:28:18] if you know the tactics
[1:28:24] there is there is a brother
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; who preached that sermon I think in
[1:28:31] brother Tim's church
[1:28:35] if you can see it when men goes to
[1:28:36] battle
[1:28:41] before you go to battle you first
[1:28:43] understand the tactics
[1:28:48] you understand your enemy.
[1:28:52] If not,
[1:28:54] then you're going to be killed
[1:28:56] anytime you're a dead man.
[1:28:59] So you first understand the enemy,
[1:29:02] the tactics.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; When Joshua was leading the children of
[1:29:06] Israel
[1:29:10] to go around Jericho,
[1:29:14] he had to first meet the angel
[1:29:18] and then the angel gave him the tactics.
[1:29:24] And Joshua,
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; he thought maybe it's u it's the pill of
[1:29:30] fire
[1:29:32] because that's what has been leading
[1:29:34] them.
[1:29:37] And then he looked he was looking for
[1:29:39] the pill of fire.
[1:29:42] He saw the man.
[1:29:46] He saw the angel of God. Hallelujah. It
[1:29:49] is this angel
[1:29:51] that gave him the tactics.
[1:29:54] of the war.
[1:29:56] Have we received an angel of God?
[1:30:00] Have we received the seventh angel?
[1:30:03] Hallelujah. So let me tell you,
[1:30:07] it seems you have not known,
[1:30:11] how much
[1:30:13] or the level of the message where it is,
[1:30:20] the position of the message in the
[1:30:21] bottom.
[1:30:24] When I talk about the message, I'm not
[1:30:25] meaning a church. I'm
[1:30:28] the voice of God.
[1:30:32] Through the angel. Hallelujah. Amen. But
[1:30:35] if God can give us grace and then we
[1:30:38] understand,
[1:30:41] then we can be able to overcome this
[1:30:43] command here.
[1:30:48] Praise the Lord. That's why we need to
[1:30:50] feed on the message.
[1:30:53] That's why we need to know
[1:30:56] if it is the invisible union of the
[1:30:58] bride
[1:31:01] what is God's mind about
[1:31:07] if it is the going beyond the curtain of
[1:31:09] time.
[1:31:12] What is God talking about?
[1:31:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And you can know
[1:31:17] all this
[1:31:19] by listening to what the angel is
[1:31:21] saying.
[1:31:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; If God allows,
[1:31:29] I will give you the details on that.
[1:31:33] May the Lord bless you.
[1:31:36] [applause]
[1:31:40] As the musicians come,
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; brother shalom, you can come and shalom.
[1:31:47] Let's pray.
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; If you have any need,
[1:31:54] you can just humbly bow your head down.
[1:32:00] How many believe that Jehovah is here?
[1:32:06] He is going to answer your needs
[1:32:09] and heal your diseases.
[1:32:13] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Lord, dear
[1:32:14] heavenly father, king of
[1:32:17] thank you this evening
[1:32:20] for speaking to us, for speaking to our
[1:32:23] hearts.
[1:32:26] Thank you for using me, Lord.
[1:32:29] We believe that you have tried your best
[1:32:31] to expose this enemy,
[1:32:35] this devil, this guy that is giving this
[1:32:38] headache.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Lord heaven father, I pray.
[1:32:44] May you come in the heart of each and

[1:32:51] Lord. May we get more fire and more zeal
[1:32:54] to read the word
[1:32:57] to read the word of God.
[1:33:00] I pray Lord that may you reveal yourself
[1:33:03] each day in our life.
[1:33:06] There is no inner credit to the devil.
[1:33:10] There's no inner glory.
[1:33:14] Whether bad or good that we are going
[1:33:15] through
[1:33:18] it will come out good good.
[1:33:23] Nothing catches you surprised.
[1:33:26] You know better.
[1:33:29] You have our movie.
[1:33:31] You watched it even before Adam
[1:33:34] and you know everything that has
[1:33:36] happened.
[1:33:38] Oh Lord, how much more should we trust
[1:33:39] in you?
[1:33:42] How much more should we put our trust in
[1:33:43] you?
[1:33:45] Oh Lord, dear heavenly father, I thank
[1:33:48] you. I commit your children
[1:33:51] to bless them. [music]

[1:34:05] May you bless him. Dear heaven father,
[1:34:07] may he be a blessing to the body of
[1:34:09] Christ
[1:34:12] in the precious name of our Lord.
[1:34:16] Amen. Amen.

[1:34:35] offerings.
