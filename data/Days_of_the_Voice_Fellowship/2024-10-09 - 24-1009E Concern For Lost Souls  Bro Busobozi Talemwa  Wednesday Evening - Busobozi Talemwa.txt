Lead Me Lord will [Music] go there is something about being led by the Holy Spirit I remember many of you will remember when we were still in um the other small place uh when the church was just starting out um uh after we had come returned back from Ethiopia you know the Holy Spirit spoke to me so strongly and told me it was the time to go and start a fellowship in another town in another city of of the country in Ethiopia and so I I came up it I think I think it is even on the YouTube I announced it I told the Believers I feel the Lord is going to do something this time around in the city we had been going in that City for a long time H that city is called aasa we were going there for a long time but nothing was happening um maybe one or two people believe one or two people believe but that was the time of covid so we went the Lord LED led us to go and um I went with another brother from Kenya brother Kenny and uh when we arrived there uh Brethren God did wonderful things another brother ased from Adis Ababa and uh I I want to tell you on that trip alone for the first time in in the history of the country at that time we baptized more than 30 people and a church started in the house of brother Timothy I want to say when God leads you and you follow something good always happens amen praise the name of the Lord and so tonight I want us to go to the Book of Ezekiel chapter 3 thank you musicians God bless you it is very one very important to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit when he he he he sends you when he speaks to you it's very important to follow that leadership and today I want to speak on the subject concern for lost souls and if you just give me your attention tonight I believe the Lord will speak to you we are reading um Ezekiel 3: 16 we'll begin from 16 and read up to vers 21 and I read in the name of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass at the end of seven days that the word of the Lord came unto me saying son of man I have made thee a Watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the word hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me hear the word at my mouth and give them warning from me when I say unto the wicked Thou shalt surely die and thou givest him not warning nor speakest nor speaketh to warn the wicked from his Wicked way to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity uh but his blood will I require at thine hand yet if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his Wicked way wickedness nor from his we Wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou Hast delivered thy Soul again when a righteous man doth not doth turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity and I and I lay a stumbling block before him he shall die because thou Hast not given him warning he shall die in his sin and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered but his blood will I require at thine hand nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man that the righteous man the righteous sin not and he doeth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned all also thou Hast delivered thy Soul amen let us pray father Lord we uh commit these words that we have read today into your hands may you give us inspiration Lord and move over the congregation the people that are here and the people that are streaming this by the way of the internet Lord may you come and minister to each of us and by the end of the service may we indeed say that we have heard from the Lord and that he has convicted our hearts Lord in Jesus name we ask it amen you may have your seats nice to see uh you brother Emmanuel I'm happy to see you as well God bless you uh uh you remember the convention we had in eastern Uganda uh brother Emmanuel is the son of the pastor there and they doing a great work so we are so happy uh this evening to be in the house of the Lord and you know I believe there is something and and uh oh is that sister Ruth God bless you nice to see you thank you for you know making it tonight um it's you know I feel that God is doing something in our midst and we are really turning some sort of a corner in the in the fellowship here in the work of God that he has given to us here uh because these days whenever I go maybe praying or meditating he speaks to me very clearly about uh where we are supposed to go what we are supposed to do as a fellowship and uh that is why uh we have actually um we did not get a chance to announce it this Sunday because I was not around uh but we shall announce it properly on on on Sunday this coming Sunday we felt I felt inspired by the Lord the leadership of the Holy Spirit to um uh start uh what I called a home sales or Fellowship fellowships in different areas where Believers are coming from and um so we we started this this Monday um we've put fellowships almost in every area and the purpose is to get the message out the purpose is to do evangelism the purpose is to win souls for the Lord amen and we have uh different um and before I even continue I want to say something here um you know when you talk about a vision a vision is something that is usually very difficult to attain you know something that you can actually say and some people will laugh at you and because it looks impossible or difficult so I remember we were just about um 30 people and I announced to you that we needed to collect money for the church land right at the beginning you know God showed us where we would go how the fellowship would go it doesn't mean it would be easy if God has given the vision it is got to accomplish it so we started um you know contributing you know monthly on a monthly basis and um we pledged quite a good sum of of money about within about I think two years um and about 30 Millions also from just about 30 people or even less those who were pledging and giving and it looked very difficult and almost impossible that we will attain our goal and so well we increased and filled the place and so we needed a tent and then we filled that place so we needed place and by God's grace we came here now uh coming here made us lose some amount of money I think about 10 million or so and so it it was a big discouragement and so it discouraged many to give those who giving they gave up they stopped giving so I would go in my little study and I begin praying and meditating oh God what next what [Music] next brothers and sisters there is something about being led by God when by God there you will know that whatever God tells you must come to pass but when you are led by somebody you will not be sure whether the thing will whether come to pass on that person may forsake you or may let but God will never do if God has promised something we'll fulfill it so God led me that's why in Mage we have no headquarter where the one the one in command is the one who gives all in the message all of us we see and all of us we hear from our Arch Bishop fellow every Fellowship is that Pastor to listen from the Holy Spirit and so um and so God will lead me you know got another idea of get dividing us into several groups and um the target was that each group would at least raise 250,000 and um we divided the church into seven groups I talked to one person he said that is not sustainable people will give up people canot sustain that pressure I also was seeing it but one thing that gave me strength was it was the leadership of the Holy Spirit I have so confidence in the Holy Spirit even when others fail the Holy Spirit Can't Fail when I fail when you fail the Holy Spirit cannot fail so we divided the church into seven groups and within 30 I think last Sunday was how many weeks 35 weeks yes that is 35 weeks ago weeks and we by God's grace have been able to raise um a total sum of 30 uh I'm looking at a brother to tell me he not here how much in the past 36 weeks 35 weeks 36 Millions yes 36 millions and so and for a total sum right now we have 62 million now that looked like a dream but we are closing in on our Target we only need 210 million or 200 Millions God is able to do that hallelujah amen we are going to attain it because it was it was a leadership from the Holy Spirit those without jobs God is going to continue giving them jobs know and those with with less income God will increase the income and even God is able to do it in the way we never expected you know God can give us land that is cheap he's the owner of this world you know God can you know raise someone Among Us and you know donate a big sum of or maybe someone following the service on whichever way but I know he will do it and know the way brother would say it if he's coming back next year if we know he's coming back next year let him find us doing something for the Lord it won't hurt anything praise the name of the Lord amen and so I had this leadership then to also set this home sales home to be able to do evangelism around the city and around where Believers come from because as you can see is mid services or less comes of different reasons one of them being transport and so um it was a burden to me how can I do it how can we do it until this idea just came to me you know um we can divide the fellowship in different uh segments or areas and start fellowships there we have many brothers Among Us who can preach and can witness they may not necessarily be accomplished preachers but at least they can witness and that's all we need to do and encourage the Breen let's say it may be difficult for you to bring someone here to church but it is easy for you to bring to call someone to your home or take them to a home of another believer that is the purpose and so we've I I will announce those home sales all of them on on Sunday but it has already started I was invited right away when sister PE heard of that she's um one of the students that are at ucu so she told me Pastor you are you are here every Monday this Monday we went there by God's grace and they they you know they collected them they gathered themselves I think we have um two Believers from this Fellowship there two or three and then one and then two from um uh another church that we have so far known that the university has I was told more than 10,000 students talking about a very huge congregation if they will not come to church we will take the message to where they areion we now have we will take the messenger if on the streets we shall take it on radio we are taking it wherever in their homes we will go we are going to print tracks we will send and so they also invited their friends so they were about 10 students there and I preached on God's provided way for the end time and one person asked about what a baptism they explained it to them and they promise they will come back again we believe it's going to be a amen not only there but in every place where Believers we should be under expectation we should be on fire for we don't have much time what we have received is gold it's not just for us to receive and sleep is for us to receive and be on fire to spread it to somebody else praise the name of the Lord amen and so we have read today from eel and I'm speaking to you on concern for lost souls and he said if when you see a wicked man and um and he says you okay I'll begin up there he says um I have made you a Watchman unto the house of Israel um you know a Watchman is someone who watches for danger he sees danger coming and he warns the rest of the people hey danger is coming danger is coming watch out so now he says he has made us he has made you a Watchman every believer is a Watchman we are a watch I am a Watchman he says I have made your Watchman unto the house of Israel therefore hear the word at my at my mouth and give them give the people give them warning from me when I say unto the wicked you will die and you don't give them the warning no speakest to warn the wicked from his Wicked way to save his life the same Wicked man shall die in his iniquity but his blood will I require at your hand imagine that you may be guilty you may be condemned not because you did not believe but because you believed and ignored or you did not have the concern for the lost souls may God help us to have concern for the lost soul but you see instead of Believers having concern for the lost soul you find them actually also conniving with the lost souls to sin do you know do you know the worst thing that God hats what God hats most more is a Believer who knows the truth but becomes a stumbling block to those who do not know the Bible says such a person is a person who has seen the light and then he goes into the darkness and he does those works of darkness that God redeemed him out of he says he will even be he's even worse in other words he says is taking back Christ on the cross and he said there is no no more blood or shed for them no more sacrifice you see how serious it is when you know the truth when you have received the truth you must not only keep it under your if indeed it is true you have received the truth you are going to be on fire you want your neighbor to know the truth your you want to go with someone to church to hear this message you want to not only hear the message but you want someone else to hear it you are convinced about this message therefore you are concerned about it you may not be a preacher but you will do something to redeem that person and in a message convinced and and then concerned says I don't want anyone to be lost amen amen I am concerned about you I am concerned about the people because I'm convinced that Jesus is Christ how many are convinced this message is the truth if you convinced this message is the truth you are going to be concerned about telling someone about it you're going to be concerned about telling someone God has sent a prophet you are going to be concerned oh my I want you to follow me here he says I'm convinced that we are living in the last days some people know we are living in the last days but they are not convinced about it I wonder how many are convinced we are living in that's the reason I well on the field I saided many years ago he says I could have been two times a million I said I could have been two times a [Applause] multi-millionaire but but it says why he says you know they were giving him money and you know what but he says why didn't I why didn't you take it your pastor here knows that how many times thousands times thousands of dollars we turned down brother by the way had an opportunity of being one of the richest preachers one of the richest forget about the ones you reading about brother bam had a gift that would have made him a multimillionaire you see these people these days they just have a little gift of designment which even has a margin of error but see how many people they have and see how much money they have made for but many times brother Bram refused the man he turned down the why because he said I know we are living in the last days I'm convinced we are at the end time and I'm concerned about the condition of the church here at the end here at the end how many are concerned about what is going on in the world I wonder if this message is not becoming so common to us may this message never become so common to us amen amen you know I want you to see here in the book of Isaiah chapter 6 ver 5 it says then said I why is me uh you can read it out of Isaiah 658 if you can it says then said I W me for I am undone because I am a man of unclean lips and and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the Lord of hor then flew one of the seraphim unto me having a live call in his hand which he had taken with the tongues of the Altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said Lo this has touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also can vers verse 8 also I heard the voice of the Lord saying whom shall I send and who will go for us then said I here am I send me friends I want you to follow me closely here we see this man Isaiah well of course it says that in the in the in the year that died he saw the Lord but you see he found himself to be unclean many reasons people when they receive this message they feel they unlean to preach it because this is a holy message praise the name of the Lord amen are you following me I don't want you to be distracted because I know you are used to brother interpreting but Brother Martin also can actually interpret and so I want you to uh don't not be distracted I want you to follow me closely praise the name of the Lord amen because I understand some when you're used to someone when you're used to your pastor are preaching in a certain way and another preacher comes on the pulpit you get concerned on how the words are coming more than what is coming out so I want you to hear the words not the way it is brought out and pray for The Interpreter and for myself as well now I want you to follow closely here because something that I have really on my heart to share with you this evening he says why is me I am undone because I am a man of unclean [Applause] lips and I dwell in the midst of unclean people people who have unclean lips but you see this man could not go and tell he could not go and testify he would not go and witness because of the kind of life he [Applause] had you see because he knew the way he was he admitted he accepted that he needed a change that he need an encounter with God by the way let me tell you that's one of the things why people don't have an encounter with God they don't accept they don't accept you don't admit your wrongdoing you you don't accept you need a savior you don't accept you are bad you are pretending you are good even when you know you are bad and because of that God doesn't visit you but brother sister the moment you get to understand I am bad I need a savior I am struggling I need a change when you are concerned about yourself and youed about the word God will visit you and when God visits you he will change you and when it changes you then he will give you a burden and a concern the lost souls out there amen because you will have a desire for God to visit someone the way God visited you hallelujah amen I remember when I was 15 years when when God visited me and I believe this message I received a burden because I was shocked I was shocked you know like the way God visited me the way God changed me don't know what I'm talking I was very hard I was very difficult you know someone who's difficult Hard Hearted I believed in my church in the doctr of the Anglican Church I even wanted to be a bishop because that's something I had grown under I had grown under the bishop and I seen how God is using him and I thought this is the closest you can be and so when I would see him with that ring and the cross on him and you know he would raise up his hand and bless everyone in my heart I also wanted to bless everyone I felt that is serving God I felt that is being close to God but when God visited me and he spoke to me I received a burden in my heart amen and I believed this message and I was baptized in the name of Jesus Christ from that day I received a new concern in my a con for Souls conc for L Soul like I was no I I never stood I've never in all my life stood up to preach I've never done it because I was promised money I've never preached for a meal ticket I've never preached because I was going to get something out of it let me tell you even if you all stopped paying your ties I will preach why am I saying that I don't care whether I am a pastor or an apostle teacher or all I care about is the burden God has put on my heart is the concern for the Lost Souls not because I'm a preacher because I'm a Believer believe this message God places a fresh fire a fresh burden in you Amen to amen you you receive a renewed Vision A Renewed mind you not watch someone who God Has Changed look at them they will have a new vision a new mind a new Drive you know something that pushes you something that amen gives you purpose gives you a reason you feel like the whole world is dying and you feel like you are the Savior you feel like you are the one with something you don't even have time to go in sin you don't even have time for the devil you don't have time for jokes you don't have time for foolish Justice because you have a concert you have a birad day for lost soul praise the name of the Lord amen and so Isaiah isah he was a sinner he felt he was not worthy and he could not go out the Bible says you know when he cried out he said I'm a man of unclean I dwell among unlean people and then the moment he confessed that the Bible says one of theim amen he came down having a call of which had taken out with tongues you know tongues know the tongues that you know hold you know the tongues yes he he took the tongues from the altar not the altar the altar of God the presence of God Amen an angel came from the presence of God Amen and took the tongue and took a call of fire even an angel could not touch that call of fire with his hands so hot listen friends he took it out of there and brought it down on the lips of Isaiah amen when you go in that presence of God he will burn you with a fire the fire of the Holy Ghost which will give you a new burden a new mind a new idea you know he touched his lips and his iniquity his sin was ped and his iniquity was taken away and he heard a voice hallelujah amen the moment you have an experience in the Holy Ghost the first thing that comes to you you will hear a voice you will hear a voice it will not come from a man it will not come from a church it will not come from your parents it will come from God and that voice told the prophet Whom Shall I save and who will go for us then he said my me you will hear the voice of sending you have a concern for the L not just a concern for your money or a concern for this and that but a concern for the Lost Souls praise the name of the Lord amen some of us we are so much living a life of sin until we don't have a burden for L Souls if you see someone without a burden for lost souls they living in sin you know you have friends all around you but they don't even know the message you believe they don't even know there is a prophet in the land they don't even know there is a Rapture coming they don't even know there is baptism in Jesus name what kind of person are you you've never found that fire brother when you meet that angel and it burs you with that fire you cannot remain the same amen am your mind will devise new things every day you'll be coming up with ideas how can we reach our generation with this message amen hallelujah amen anything you are doing you want to show a difference it may be music through your music you want to show the people there is a prophet in the Land There is a message in the land you want to show them that we are different through your testimony through your life through your dealings brother bam continues on and he says now we all ought to be con convinced and when we convince our when we are convinced Our Lives begin to burn you have no rest you have no rest brother there is something we can't stand still about it you feel like you cannot stay still hallelujah amen hallelujah amen that is why we are not building an organization this message we are not building an organization we are not preaching to S to bring them to church as much as we bring them to church we bring them to church for their experience with the Lord to be established but we don't preach to souls to increase the number of our we preach to souls to bring them to a living God we evangelize not the name of our church we are not going out there to advertise our church no we are advertising the name of Jesus we advertising our home where we are going we advertising the coming of the Lord praise the name of the Lord amen and he says you have you cannot rest you just as he said a while ago he couldn't sleep all night he was so convinced that that was God he was so convinced that that was God he was concerned about getting getting it it himself self see what I mean convince then concern yes John stayed in the wilderness until he found out what the program of God was then he was concerned he knew his sign Andrew stayed all night with Jesus and then he was concerned about his brother yes jaob had a that he must go back home but he know he had to face his enemy he didn't know how he was going to do it what did he do first he stayed there until got a hold of God and when he was convinced that he had the blessing because God said so then he was concerned Hallelujah that is the patter we our pattern is not going to a Bible College and then you know you are given a certificate oh you are blessed by big men the message we have no big men and small men we have a big God and a big message we don't have no Bible College we have a holy ghost experience and when you meet the encounter with God he says then you go out hallelujah amen we sing it in a song then go out the streets and byways tell to everyone tell to many of you said to every Fallen brother there is Honey in the Rock for you why are you doing that because you yourself you have an experience you have met God you have met the fire amen and then it got you concerned first he must stay until he know something happened he had a mark in his physical being that showed that God had placed it upon amen the great big strong well the great big strong well he was he was Jacob on this side of the river a great big strong healthy coward and on the other side of the river he was a limping Israel did you get that a great big strong coward oh get these words one by one very good he was a great big strong healthy coward on the other side of the river and on this side of the river after meeting the angel he was a limping Israel oh Hallelujah am we better be a limping Israel being a great big healthy C we have many believers who are great big healthy strong [Music] cowards they cannot witness about they God they cannot go on the streets and talk about it they can't even tell their friends about it their cowards but brother meet God first when you meet God amen you receive a new concern on this side of the river he was a strong man Jacob a deceiver and on the other side of the river he was a limping Warrior not afraid of nothing he didn't even want anything El I could give him some of you cry cry cry to your family members oh do this for me give me this do this for me let me tell you when you meet God in that experience you don't want anybody you don't want anybody what anybody gives you amen we don't want what religion gives us amen when we meet God you don't want no Bible College certificate you don't want no theology oh do I have Believers in the house today when you meet God you don't want the organization to sanction you send you no one sends you then someone tell jaob after he be Israel tell him don't go tell him don't go you cannot stop him at first he was a coward could not go and when he made God no one could stop him amen he had so much concern woo glory to God Amen he didn't even want anything else I could give him he was convinced that he had been touched by God every work made it different when a man is so differently see the difference of the mark of the Holy Ghost in his life then you are convinced then you are concerned when you see the next man a big cowardly Jacob stand this way saying we bless God I am do so and so I'm from so and so oh brother get down and Limp a little he says get down and Limp a little bit get down and Limp a little bit many times when we go to the missionary Fields people ask us who are you which church are you from who is your general overseer where is your headquarter but they can't understand us because we are little liming Warriors we don't have all those accolades we don't have them we are not called doctors PhD the most Reverend but I'll tell you what we are we have met the Holy Ghost we have made a pill of fire we know what we believed we know we are going in rapture we know who we are we know we are believers of the message of the hour we know soon very soon is coming to take us to Glory we don't have a big church name but we have a big Jesus name who are we we are believers of the world that's what we are we are free from denomination we are free from religion we have been liberated we have been set free by the power of the message and we have a reason to go out and tell it no man can stop us do you know why brother if you are standing right with God and you are living a life that is right with God you got tell this message no one can stop you all the Demons of Hell canot withstand you because there's a fire bubbling up in your bones hallelujah amen hallelujah amen but is different because Revelation 3:17 says because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou rich and miserable and poor and blind and naked that is our generation Lan Church age is so rich yet we have done so little for God we are so busy building our church organization let me tell you Brethren our vision is not to build a big denomination or religion organization called dvf you may misunderstand me but I said to hell with dvf that is not our vision we are not here to build a big name of our Bishop I may be a bishop but your work is not preach me your work is my work our work is to preach Christ amen but inia we are so busy the building our organizations we are so busy fasting about who is the greatest Among Us you have even had some people in the message saying our pastor is the best pastor and preacher in the world that doesn't matter you know we are busy finding out who has more people in his church who preaches better and we have neglected the message of our day it is a disgrace we are so busy educating ourselves going to schools and schools and schools and yet Our Generation has produced the generation of fools people who have done so foolish things that even when you check the generations before us they couldn't do so we becoming more educated or are becoming more foolish in a country where you tell me that these are people who are educated you cannot ask a question who is a woman the moment you ask a question who is a woman you will be called all sorts of things you a bigot you are this you that simply because you ask somebody who is a woman or are you a woman or are you a man is that education of foolishness and they're bringing it in our curriculums it's not only in America Europe it's coming to Africa it's taking over the world time will come when believer teachers many Believers in America started their own schools or they homeschool their children because filth is so great instead of becoming wise they became fools the you read your Bible it says they profess to be wise but they became fools we are so committed to making money and yet we give less money than the is before us we no longer have time to go to church we are too occupied with Big Dreams Big Dreams that can never be achieved yet heaven heaven is the only realistic dream those who have trusted in Jesus never been confounded am let me tell you friends you may call me all sorts of things by saying these words but that's the truth that's what is f and we need young men we need young ladies mothers fathers married people and single people who will have Vision according to the program of God I don't care about your program God has a program and God's program is the word praise the name of the Lord amen see brother Message thean Church age he says they were not burden for Souls but they were burdened with wealth with we wealth wealth that's right they have the wrong burden they had a burden for their wealth but not a burden for lost souls the scripture say they didn't know that they were wretched miserable and blind they think that they could take money and convert the world or if we could just get a program on and we could get a lot of money here I believe we can we could convert the world some people actually even know some brothers who cannot do anything for God because they have no money we need 37 million shillings to prepare the upcoming youth meetings as I speak we have zero and we need it in two months how possibly could we have raised that a church of only barely 100 people 37 million shs you could say impossible let us dump the dream but listen friends it's not money that serves God it's not money that converts the world it is a burden it is a concern oh if you could just get a program on that we could get a lot of money here oh someone says if some of the rich people in our church if you could just get them to dig out and I believe that we could start a society that that would go around and convert the world we could take airplanes and drop literature all over Africa things like that if we just had some money brother the world won't be converted by money someone is not hearing this the world will not be converted by money the world will be converted by the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen by what by the Holy Ghost by powerful preaching of the Holy Ghost not slow you know you know kind of cold preaching no he's talking about powerful Holy Ghost that's why when you read this Bible are you hearing me brother Solomon you know when you read this Bible what does he talk about he talks about you know powerful preaching and they preached the word with so much Authority that's why the Bible speaks of the disciples like that they never talked about them as if they were preaching like men who didn't know what they were talking about you younger brothers that are going to be preaching in this day are going to be preaching in these cells don't go out there and begin talking as if you don't know what you're talking about even if you have two people there stand your ground take the word and preach it in power and in demonstration of the Holy Ghost that will convert the world Amen and he says on the cross amen he says amen what what talk about he says the Holy Spirit powerful preaching of the Holy Ghost and the cross will be the only thing that will convert the world God's program is not money tell your neighbor God his program is not ask me what is God's program God's program is not our churches is not our church names it's not our pastors it's not our money God his program is the holy ghost that is God's program for thean church age or any other age amen that is God's program for our age praise the name of the Lord amen and in the message what was the Holy Ghost given for he says that's the purpose of the Holy Ghost is the father again God and the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemp Hallelujah you following me now working through you making you a coworker with him giving you a place giving you a part for your Fallen lost brother and sister giving you his Spirit his love to go hand the lost as he did in the garden ofen Adam Adam where are you that is what the Holy Spirit does to a man or a woman when it strikes their heart when it strikes your heart and it takes a board there is a thir there is a thirst and a hunger for L Soul that's what the matter with the meetings today there is not enough Spirit touch in it to go for L For The Souls of the Lost and the dying it is more to make a name to make a church aaut aomination instead of a soul winning program and brother bam says how pitiful praise the name of the Lord praise the name of the Lord and when you receive the Holy Ghost you can't settle you want to reach out you want to witness to somebody you have a concern for the lost soul Romans 10 says whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved but how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him whom of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace when he says except they be sent the denomination that sends you it is God that sends you when you meet that Pillar of Fire it doesn't matter who you are sister or brother in the message the lamb and the dove he says no matter how much you preach you got a real ill temper don't it doesn't do you so much good to preach doesn't do you much good to preach no matter how much you join church and try to impersonate you are crabbing and nasty with your neighbor you will never win him to Christ then it is the fruit of the spirit as my wife used to tell me actions speak louder than words that's right leave me a someon instead of preaching me good thing leave me a sermon all of us can be preachers through a lived someone our life s don't have to go and take a microphone and you can live through your life the way you live the way you dress the way you deal with your neighbors you see some neighbors are very naughty wildly you know and then they see they can relate with you the way they relate with other women then you also you also let that happen you've just failed to preach someone you have an opportunity sisters to preach to your neighbors your neighbors are your friends the people that you live around let them feel the vibe of the Holy Spirit coming from you not some sort of worldly kind of Vibes but that of the holy spirit let them test and see that the Lord is good in your life that you a different kind of woman that there will be so much pulled and attracted and they will ask you take me to your church I want to finish with this quote this story has been given many times story of David Daniel rather Daniel Curry cry in the message of the church and its condition listen to it carefully here some time ago in about 100 years ago there was a great Christian lived in the Southwest United States his name was Daniel carry a wonderful man a godly man a sainted man a real Christian a man that everybody thought of so much such a wonderful person and The Story Goes that he died or went into trans and he said he went up to heaven of course when he died and when he got to the Pates the caretaker come to the door and said who are you and he said I am the evangelist Daniel Curry have worn thousands of souls to Christ not have built buildings of built Church buildings I've given birth to Children been a great prostitute all these things good or bad that are taking your time we leave it here you won't go there and say well I have you know five degrees I was a great doctor that's all nothing the only thing he could bust off was have led thousands of souls to CHR how many Souls have you led to Christ that's why Paul would say why unto me if I preach not the gospel and when he got to the par Gates when he said I want to come in this morning my life's journey is ended on Earth I have no place to go now and he says that's the way it's coming to you some morning Sina that's the way it's coming to you backslider that's the words coming to you that the holy spirit away from them not be gentle and tender anymore you haven't cried for years you haven't cried yes you haven't cried for years you haven't blushed for I don't know when all modest is gone from you but it's going to come to your door one of these and as a as the gentle Holy Spirit comes as it coming right now he says why don't you just let him in and many times that happens in the services and you just walk away don't do that so when Daniel Curry come they to the gate they went in said we will see if you got your name here they looked all around they couldn't find any they said no there is not Daniel cry here oh he said surely I am an evangelist I've worn souls to Christ what I love about this qu the only work he could bust out he one what are you doing brother in your right wherever you are whatever doing what are you doing in will is the only thing you could bust of and he said I've tried to do the right the thing that is right the said I'm sorry to tell you but there is no Daniel Curry here he said I'll tell you what you might do said we have no right here to take your case he said but do you want to appeal your case you can appeal it to the white Throne judgment if you want to said we have no Mery here for you because we don't have you here there is no mercy for you here he said do you want to appeal your Cas he sir what more can I do but appeal my Cas he said well then you can go to the white Throne judgment and Daniel said that he felt himself going through the space for about an hour he said he came into a place got lighter and lighter and lighter he went the light got it was 100 times thousands of times brighter than the sun ever shin and he said he was trembling trembling and he said when he got in the middle of that light he had a voice say was you perfect on Earth just come out of a light he said no I wasn't perfect he got trembling he said did you always play honest with everybody were you always honest with everybody he said no he said a few things come to my mind that I wasn't just exactly honest about said no I guess I wasn't honest said did you tell the truth in every case in your life say no I remember some things told that wasn't Shady was sh I never was truthful just exactly said then did you ever take anything that did not belong to you anything money anything that didn't belong to you he said he thought on Earth that was he was pretty good but he was condemned he said no no no I've taken things that didn't belong to he said then he wasn't perfect he said no he wasn't perfect said he was looking any minute for the blast to come from that great light from where the dve rested coming out said condemn said just then he had a voice behind him that was sweeter than any mother's voice that he has ever heard said he turned to look and the sweetest face she had ever saw sweeter than any mother's face was standing before him and said father Daniel car stood for me down on Earth it is true he wasn't perfect but he stood for me he stood for me on earth now I'm going to stand for him in heaven take all of his sin and put them over on my account again and the prophet asks who is going to stand for you that day let us stand on our feet oh god father we just have to want to have that concern for the soul lord Jesus what can we have when we come before you what shall we boast of shall we boast of the money shall we boast of the big churches what shall we boast of our education our families of buildings we are built to land oh we have nothing to Bo we realize Lord Jesus in that light we are all sinful even if we think we are perfect but we are not but the only thing that can help us is if we stand for you today if we stand for you Lord Jesus and have a concern you had when you came down on Earth and you died on the cross for God so loved the world he gave his beg that whoever believeth on him should not perish but have ever and you have sent a message of the hour to bring the light of that sun to us whosoever will take it to the souls that are perishing the soul that are dying him will you stand for on and you will tell them well done my good and faithful servant you stood for me I'll stand for you then you will give an order put their sins on my account oh God pray that each of us will meet you young men Lord Jesus you meet them each one of them Father burden Lord a burden for Souls the many who are perishing in sin and Lord we have no time to waste help us Lord that we will go call them up call them out of sin for surely we know if we don't we will be condemned with them Lord Jesus I even think of my neighbor here just my next neighbor man who was full of life and then one time I invited him to church but he went to work and just passed away just like that what if I hadn't given him that invitation what if father may you give us a burden Lord for the neighbors that we have for the friends we have maybe someone has been dealing
