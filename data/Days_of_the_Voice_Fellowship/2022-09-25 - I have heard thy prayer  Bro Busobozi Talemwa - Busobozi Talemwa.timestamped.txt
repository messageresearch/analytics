[1:02:51] you know we do not know what happened so
[1:02:54] I I had to drive there no visiting India

[1:03:01] people who snatch funds from people when
[1:03:03] the people when when they're in the in
[1:03:06] the cars if you have Windows your window
[1:03:07] down they just snatch your phone and run

[1:04:22] to understand the whole situation but
[1:04:24] they also understand that he was
[1:04:27] mistaken yeah
[1:04:36] because they do not have any exhibit to
[1:04:39] say that it's the one who did it
[1:04:43] but you know the people were very
[1:04:46] Furious
[1:04:48] and so the officer told me you know I

[1:11:59] [Music]
[1:12:02] I'm speaking to you this morning on a
[1:12:05] very important subject is
[1:12:13] second Kings chapter 20 from verse 1 to
[1:12:16] 7.
[1:12:23] in those days was Hezekiah sick unto
[1:12:26] death and the prophet Isaiah the son of
[1:12:29] Moses came to him and said unto him thus
[1:12:33] saith the Lord
[1:12:35] sit down house in order for Thou shalt
[1:12:39] die and not leave
[1:12:41] then he turned his face to the wall and
[1:12:45] prayed unto the Lord saying I beseech
[1:12:48] thee O Lord remember now how I have
[1:12:52] walked before thee in truth and with the
[1:12:55] perfect with a perfect heart and have
[1:12:58] done that which is good in thy sight and
[1:13:01] Hezekiah whip so
[1:13:04] and it came to pass before Isaiah was
[1:13:07] gone out into the middle court that the
[1:13:11] word of the Lord came unto him saying
[1:13:13] son again until Hezekiah the captain of
[1:13:18] my people thus saith the Lord the god of
[1:13:21] David thy father I have had thy prayer I
[1:13:26] have seen the tears behold I will heal
[1:13:29] thee
[1:13:30] on the third day Thou shalt go up into
[1:13:34] unto the house of the Lord and I will
[1:13:37] add unto thy days 15 years and I will
[1:13:40] deliver thee and this city out of the
[1:13:43] hand of the king of Prayer
[1:13:45] and I will defend this city for my own
[1:13:48] sake and for my servant David is sake
[1:13:50] and Isaiah said take alarm or fix and
[1:13:55] they took and laid it on the boil
[1:13:58] and he recovered
[1:14:00] is
[1:14:06] um
[1:14:20] foreign
[1:15:16] foreign
[1:15:56] amen Lord Jesus we object and a portion
[1:16:00] of scripture
[1:16:02] we have read it as men
[1:16:05] but we ask for inspiration from Europe
[1:16:09] not come here to see one another
[1:16:12] I have not even come here to talk to
[1:16:14] these people of my own language
[1:16:18] I need you Lord to give me utterance
[1:16:21] Use Me Lord because the sun will come up
[1:16:24] and may you put bind us all together in
[1:16:27] the same spirit this morning
[1:16:34] in Jesus name
[1:16:47] give us the way
[1:16:52] as usual I want to request for your
[1:16:54] undivided attention
[1:17:00] and try to limit movement as much as you
[1:17:03] can yeah
[1:17:08] and plus that your phone is in silence
[1:17:17] so that you can be here a hundred
[1:17:20] percent
[1:17:23] praise the Lord
[1:17:30] I want you to look at that
[1:17:32] you know how many I've ever read this
[1:17:34] portion of scriptures
[1:17:42] okay what about those who have never
[1:17:45] heard of this portion of life
[1:17:52] and so I want to believe that we are all
[1:17:54] Christians
[1:17:57] and so
[1:17:59] um here was a man
[1:18:02] a man who whose days had come to an end
[1:18:09] and God now sent a prophet to him
[1:18:13] and you know God is always in the
[1:18:16] business of sending prophets
[1:18:20] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:18:22] and forever he never changes
[1:18:26] so if he did send prophets once you will
[1:18:29] always send foreign
[1:19:11] [Music]
[1:19:30] man believe in prayer
[1:19:36] great women have been women of prayer
[1:19:41] and if you want to be great in this life
[1:19:46] you must be a man a woman of prayer
[1:19:51] if you are not a prayerful man or woman
[1:19:56] you are not great
[1:20:00] but if you are a prayerful man or woman
[1:20:03] right
[1:20:05] you are a great man or a great woman
[1:20:09] and so this was a king
[1:20:11] and with all that he had done for the
[1:20:14] Lord
[1:20:16] suffering and affliction
[1:20:20] and I want to say that suffering and
[1:20:23] afflictions are a part of our Christian
[1:20:25] journey
[1:20:31] and many times
[1:20:35] many times
[1:20:38] [Music]
[1:20:53] it might sound strange but it is not
[1:20:55] strange
[1:21:00] one point in your life
[1:21:18] you know once always for us to keep
[1:21:22] focused on those things
[1:21:31] the devil's plan is to allow you to
[1:21:35] focus on those things
[1:21:40] and God will not take them away
[1:21:46] he will not take away those things
[1:21:49] a Christian suffers Affliction
[1:21:55] and we went through that sometime back
[1:21:58] and you're driving
[1:22:01] that every Christian in this world
[1:22:05] at one point will suffer Affliction
[1:22:11] how men have ever been in need
[1:22:14] I'm not speaking something strange
[1:22:18] I'm talking about our everyday life
[1:22:33] yes how many have ever wanted to have
[1:22:36] something
[1:22:39] how many have ever been desperate
[1:23:11] you know in every continent there is a
[1:23:13] problem that is
[1:23:22] the Western World
[1:23:25] you find a lot of natural disasters
[1:23:32] and a lot of sickness
[1:23:35] well now you you find that you will they
[1:23:39] will get Wildfire back to normal
[1:23:42] and people will lose their property
[1:23:46] foreign
[1:24:55] foreign
[1:24:57] [Music]
[1:25:07] [Music]
[1:25:53] physical problem is lack of
[1:26:25] that's why people become you know they
[1:26:29] become hard-hearted
[1:26:31] you know people don't go to churches
[1:26:34] anymore
[1:26:35] even when they do they have a form of
[1:26:38] godliness
[1:26:46] you have also seen many fresh pastors
[1:26:55] of us is to try and make some money for
[1:26:57] themselves
[1:27:00] they just go there and do some comedy
[1:27:03] back again
[1:27:04] people usually are calling for I don't
[1:27:07] know why over there you know they just
[1:27:10] deceive woman in people are and oh they
[1:27:13] just can't take the money
[1:27:18] I want you you know I I want to show you
[1:27:21] something here
[1:27:22] you know they play their games
[1:27:30] many times it is
[1:27:43] whenever you see a Ministry settled on a
[1:27:47] man it is already a false Ministry
[1:27:55] true Ministry is usually zeroed on
[1:27:58] Christ I'm wearing double two full is
[1:28:01] strong our emphasis is not a man a man
[1:28:06] our emphasis is not our Bishops
[1:28:17] our emphasis is on the word of God
[1:28:23] Jesus Christ
[1:28:26] that's the purpose why we are Christians
[1:28:37] because they want money
[1:28:40] and they will get this money and they
[1:28:43] will try to go marry second wife
[1:28:47] and they will go abroad by Mansions
[1:28:51] they will drive cars which look like
[1:28:54] people never foreign
[1:28:59] [Music]
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:56] but you know when Jesus came in I think
[1:29:59] it was Simon's house
[1:30:02] you know they never washed his feet they
[1:30:05] never they never cleaned him up he never
[1:30:09] gave him a good seat and they simply
[1:30:12] told him they just looked at him okay
[1:30:14] and he walked in and went to a park a
[1:30:18] seat
[1:30:19] and nobody attended to him let me tell
[1:30:23] you that is the uh the the the condition
[1:30:27] of the churches of Our Generation
[1:30:32] they have invited Jesus to come in their
[1:30:35] churches yes
[1:30:37] they have not attended to him
[1:30:42] how have they not attended to him
[1:30:45] by not hearing the word
[1:30:48] I'm not preaching the word
[1:30:51] what makes them accepted is not the word
[1:31:53] play it with foreign
[1:33:05] foreign
[1:34:08] foreign
[1:35:16] praise the name of the Lord
[1:35:18] hallelujah amen I am not standing here
[1:35:21] to entertain you
[1:35:22] sir I'm standing here in the name of the
[1:35:26] Lord
[1:35:27] give you the word of God
[1:35:31] give you the mind of God
[1:35:33] I have waited upon
[1:35:40] goddess of seeds
[1:35:42] I am not giving you the word of God
[1:35:49] they can now say foreign
[1:37:17] right in our Amina
[1:37:27] everything can failure there are two
[1:37:31] things which can never pray anybody
[1:37:34] what is the word of God
[1:37:39] they are never fails anyway
[1:37:49] these are your weapons
[1:37:57] bear is a weapon
[1:38:00] but any believer can use
[1:38:04] and praise God it works
[1:38:09] how many can shout and say it works
[1:38:18] you can never be spiritual not to pray
[1:38:21] because
[1:38:27] you can't say I'm so spiritual and
[1:38:29] Beyond prayer you can never be Beyond
[1:38:32] prayer
[1:38:35] if you don't pray you are not a
[1:38:38] Christian foreign
[1:40:01] prayer is the only communication medium
[1:40:04] between God and Men
[1:40:55] amen I want you to see this in a message
[1:40:59] Jesus Christ the same yesterday and
[1:41:01] forever
[1:41:05] said well I believe some places the some
[1:41:09] place the Bible says
[1:41:15] when the weakest
[1:41:18] of saints God to their needs
[1:41:23] Titania Khan Kana but what a woman
[1:41:29] not a powerful one who is weak here
[1:41:35] when you go to your knees
[1:41:38] never begins
[1:41:42] why why because they know the outcome of
[1:41:46] that is
[1:42:01] what a powerful and a privilege
[1:42:05] had been given to the church
[1:42:09] I mean when you fall to your knees
[1:42:13] in a prayer Masala even the devil's
[1:42:17] tremble name is Simone to the weakest of
[1:42:21] Christians
[1:42:26] you don't have to be powerful you don't
[1:42:29] have to know how to speak in tongues
[1:42:36] you only need to believe in God

[1:43:41] praying always with all prayer and
[1:43:44] supplication
[1:43:45] in the spirit
[1:43:48] and watching the country with all
[1:43:50] perseverance and supplication for All
[1:43:52] Saints

[1:45:45] you think about what you're going
[1:45:47] through
[1:45:49] knowing that this is the solution
[1:45:52] then you you know you go into
[1:45:54] supplications foreign
[1:46:19] if you you if you cannot shut tears in
[1:46:22] prayer you have not prayed buttons

[1:46:32] if you think you're a prayer warriors
[1:46:53] God is calling for prayer
[1:46:59] and I'll prove everything I'm saying by
[1:47:00] the Bible
[1:47:03] in James 4 7 it says resist the devil
[1:47:06] and he will flee from here
[1:47:10] how do you resistance Hallelujah
[1:47:18] when you take your knee
[1:47:21] watches you that's why the devil always
[1:47:24] fight serious
[1:47:26] he doesn't want you to go to your needs
[1:47:30] when you're about to go there
[1:47:33] bring something
[1:47:39] by the way I need to do this actually
[1:47:42] and now after you've done everything
[1:47:44] then the baby cries
[1:47:53] I have to go to work
[1:47:55] I have to do this
[1:48:01] you may never find time to pray
[1:48:59] that is where our solution is
[1:49:11] no matter how big our problems is
[1:49:15] no matter how big the devil is
[1:49:19] the solution
[1:49:25] yes sir
[1:49:27] I mean praise the name of the Lord
[1:49:29] believe in God 1953 he says that is the
[1:49:33] reason
[1:49:37] the prayer of faith shall serve the sick
[1:49:48] your father and prayer overages
[1:50:02] Christ gave us
[1:50:06] The Authority
[1:50:10] with his name
[1:50:12] by being Christians
[1:50:17] the most powerful weapon
[1:50:21] is
[1:50:31] the most powerful weapon is
[1:50:39] [Applause]
[1:50:45] it even changes everything
[1:50:54] my goodness it will change the mind of
[1:50:57] God oh Christ
[1:51:00] it did do it
[1:51:03] after death was pronounced
[1:51:25] foreign

[1:52:25] so if is that powerful that is
[1:52:32] my we do not realize how great it is
[1:52:44] we don't really realize
[1:52:47] how great prayer is
[1:52:58] foreign foreign
[1:53:29] my mother would go to the bedroom and
[1:53:31] pray
[1:53:33] for night prayers because
[1:53:55] hallelujah amen God answers prayer
[1:54:02] I'll I'll show you an example here let
[1:54:04] us go to the book of Acts chapter 12.
[1:54:11] it's a little long reading but it's very
[1:54:14] powerful for us and I wanted to go
[1:54:15] through it
[1:54:21] you can open there open there with me
[1:54:23] and let us read slowly your brother put
[1:54:24] the cross on the screen
[1:54:28] was kept in prison had brother Solomon
[1:54:30] brother Force kept in prison I prepared
[1:54:32] this before but Solomon was in
[1:54:35] prisoners
[1:54:39] kept in prison
[1:54:41] but prayer was made without ceasing of
[1:54:44] the church God for him
[1:54:52] and when he wrote a Herod would have
[1:54:57] brought him forth the same night Peter
[1:55:00] was sleeping Between Two Soldiers bound
[1:55:03] with the two chains and they keep us
[1:55:05] before the door kept the prison
[1:55:07] listen
[1:55:28] when he says and behold the angel of the
[1:55:31] Lord came upon him
[1:55:43] foreign
[1:56:23] and raised him up
[1:56:28] saying
[1:56:31] hallelujah hallelujah Peter was just
[1:56:34] there
[1:56:34] brother can you come up here
[1:56:38] it's just down kneeling down together
[1:57:03] is this magic
[1:57:06] this is greater than magic is
[1:57:11] greater than magic is
[1:57:14] greater than witchcraft
[1:57:17] oh my goodness because prayer involves
[1:57:21] the greatest power in heaven on Earth
[1:57:30] and his chains fell off from his hands
[1:57:34] to him God thyself and bind on my sons
[1:57:54] and he went out and followed him
[1:57:58] and who is not that it was true which
[1:58:01] was done by the angel but bro thought he
[1:58:04] was saw a vision
[1:58:14] and the second word they came up and I
[1:58:18] get the leaders unto the city which
[1:58:20] opened to them of his own accord and
[1:58:24] went out and passed on on through one
[1:58:26] street and forth with the angel departed
[1:58:28] from him
[1:58:45] I don't care who has crossed the cats
[1:58:49] must open and it is
[1:59:50] things like that
[1:59:54] let me tell you
[1:59:57] the name of the Lord
[2:00:01] will be disappointed
[2:00:05] she will not marry him
[2:00:14] Hallelujah

[2:00:57] gate because of joy and gladness and so
[2:00:59] she read and told how Peter stood before
[2:01:02] the gate
[2:01:21] and they said unto her uh
[2:01:27] oh my goodness
[2:01:32] but she constantly affirmed that it was
[2:01:34] even so then they say that it is the it
[2:01:36] is
[2:01:44] when they had opened the door and they
[2:01:46] saw him they were astonished Hallelujah
[2:01:55] Hallelujah

[2:01:59] I said Hallelujah Peter was kept in
[2:02:02] prison
