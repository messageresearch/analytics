looking forward Lord Jesus [Music] let us exercise [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] verses 1 to 2. behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] praise the name of the Lord I'm happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning the message every one of you I want to first of all before we go into the scripture that we have read this morning I want to say that uh there are some who are not here with us this morning sister Monica she was not able to make it but she said she was going to be streaming December is a month of traveling for many almost you know going to be with family here's family they left to be with the family in the sister to the family of brother of sister praise [Music] the ministers in this message I know that brother John her brother um I happen to talk to him this week and he sent his greetings to the church amen and uh my mother and and the rest of our family also traveled to uh be with her family but they sent their greetings as well um well there are some others but now I've always wanted to say that we to remind to remind you of our youth meetings now when we were when I was starting to arrange this youth meeting I did not expect it to be like big initially I was thinking should we just do our own youth meetings but then again I I felt since we are having a visiting Minister coming from Canada it's not good to be selfish Brethren from other churches so initially I thought that we would just have uh churches from around us here in campaign so then you would not need to make it resident meetings because they will just come and then go back so um and as of now I have a list of about about 50. and others have not given me the numbers I thought that we will need to make these meetings resident meetings so we will be beginning our services on Friday of 20th we shall have one service then in the evening and then we shall have two services on Saturday and two services on Sundays now of course that is in January so that is 20th of January to 22nd of January [Music] um I'm still liaising with the owner of the school here and uh so far I was I met somebody that then they took me to meet the owner and so fight is they're positive and they might host us for for the dormitories so uh since I had not had not planned to make it a resident meeting until now we've not said anything and we might not actually know until the last minute I will make this open for anyone who wants a blessing to give you um I I know sometimes when you you do that many don't give um [Music] but I believe in this Fellowship we are taught that when you give you are blessed is so plan on giving and giving a lot towards the success of those meetings at least all of you that work plan for like a hundred thousand you know something like that for that for those meetings because we shall be hurting uh the the young people that you will come and then leading them to Japanese and feeding everybody here at lunch so it's our first meeting of the kind of foreign to be preaching meetings it's going to be a time of refreshing for us as much as its younger youth meetings yet we have space the others can also join it whenever and also I'd like to say that uh brother my friend brother Isaac natural language has also confirmed this coming Amen brother Isaac and jerusa he works with the young people in their Church organizations [Music] I've been there several times brother brother Isaac is um is uh he's been with me on a mission trip to Nigeria before he's a wonderful wonderful minister so he will be coming at least to minister service for us as well and I want to say plan big to do good things for us there is no reason absolutely why any of our younger people should plan to miss those meetings whatever plan you had the program for those three days I pray that you you just make it clear and make it available for you to be here there's going to be a lot of sacrifices for those who will come again brother Michael Ray confirmed is coming already but just is a air ticket and got the Visa already and I mean these are thousands of dollars so many people are going to spend a lot just to come here and be with them I believe God can't let that happen when he has not prepared something let's plan [Music] I believe we shall also have a wonderful time there foreign [Applause] you know give well what how much we've given this year uh together but again what it has done how much we need to be able to attain our goals Twitter gunmaker or two and our major project we have today uh this time around is the uh the the land and you know friends I believe we are going to attend Atlanta who usually attends our services this week she contributed about 360 000. weekend and also um sister uh sister Dorcas also contributed something and also as a brother another brother who streams um do you uh uh what's the name of the brother the brother who streams oh okay so I the name just skipped my mind but I noticed that uh we here are relaxed a bit and uh but whoever whoever pledged something in the business meeting we are going to remind you everything you have not given together so that you can pay it is hallelujah hallelujah I said Hallelujah are you ready for the word this morning how many loved ones amen I mean I love the word too so this morning I'm speaking to you on a subject of a many member body [Applause] [Music] of love the father has bestowed upon us [Music] that we should be called the sons of God you see each of us here has a father biological father so to speak some of your fathers have been very good and kind they've taken care of you ever since you were born and I've been there for you in thick and thin but at the world and some of you here are fathers who have been there for your families [Music] amen Amina and then because the Bible says of course a father must be able to provide for his own Bible if we can't he is even worse than an infidelity [Applause] that's what the Bible says some of us have had fathers who were there for us at some point and then they disappeared but then you know it the scripture here when I read it I feel confident no but I I have a father who will never forsake I have a father who will never leave me I have a father who is mindful foreign and we are Heirs of that King the moment you receive the holy ghosts to that Kingdom so all of you here who belong to that category you are princess and prince so I'm talking to royalty this morning I'm not talking to commoners now you will know why we dress the way we dressed why do you dress the way you dress why why because you are Royals hallelujah amen lawyers don't dress me in his car trousers hallelujah amen that's why we dress suits when we come to church this is the greatest meeting you will ever seeing is not when you're meeting a president or some other person is here that's why I believe in dressing well yes I mean because you are coming to meet your father and your father is a king foreign what manner of love as the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knows because they knew him if you tell someone you're a son of a king and they can't understand don't be shocked if you tell them why you dress and they can't understand it again why you talk the way you talk and they can't understand why you behave the way you behave and they can't understand because they didn't understand your father they knew him therefore they can't know us beloved now are we the sons of God he didn't say we shall be the sons of God I am a Son of God hallelujah amen and listen to me for the results of God will overcome the world of God cannot be defeated because we are built in a way to overcome the devil sometimes can take some of us and throw them in the mouth thing he always forget that we are the seed of God not anyone that he has seen out there we are the sons of God listen the devil can have enough power take you in sin but he cannot have enough power to keep you there as long as you're a Son of God that's why Mikhail said it's not against me or my enemies that's why we sing a song the love of God is so great [Applause] he will never lose me foreign [Music] Romans 8 15 says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear hallelujah amen there are foreign foreign [Music] what if I serve God whatever tomorrow I know myself what if I sing the special song and then they find me doing this I know myself that's the devil lying to you and the Bible said God our father he has given us a spirit but that spirit of fear hallelujah hallelujah for you know your father once you will be careful for nothing you will serve him anyhow because you know you are bound to overcome you must overcome sin we must overcome your weakness the devil doesn't know that but let me tell you that is because God has already said it in his words that he has not given us the spirit of bondage we cannot be in bondage anymore because the spirit of our father takes us out of that bondage hallelujah amen and he says but he have received the spirit of adoption again the spirit of adoption to be adopted we'll get to that Ephesians 1 5. having predestinated us of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will hallelujah amen according to the good pleasure of his will he has predestinated us unto the adoption did somebody get that before you were even born was already there foreign [Music] no wonder when the world came to you your heart agreed your body refused and he was stubborn for a while and you were in bondage foreign your adoption is not your boss your adoption is your blessing now that your birth goes this way when you hear the word breaks your heart you are Justified even when you were a sinner your father says now whatever you did I don't care I no longer see it you are Justified you are perfect just by believing The World God justifies that will count anymore is coming back for a perfect church God doesn't see any wrinkles where are the wrinkles they are back with the devil where they come from it is foreign when it justifies you you still have all the desires that he used to have you used to go to the Disco section and you used to like it now when it justifies the desire is still there that's why he has to bring you in his presence so that he can sanctify you can worship and he makes you perfect hallelujah amen our God is the greatest investor that on our family he doesn't worry about return on investments because it's true about his time when he invested on you boy Oh Glory to God he was sure his word was going to bring the reasons it's not about me or about you the world and make you a worthy member of the body foreign you can preach to somebody that they will believe that's easy but here's the hard part for them to be fully Sanctified only you can sit under that word you'll be finished you'll be finished yes but as long as you can overpower the devil there is so powerful that you will always overpower them God has confidence in that way and when you see another word sometimes when people come in the church and there is nothing within them to Quicken they will immediately be a friend down the road again you will say something from the world again that's how powerful the word is you It Happened One Day Jesus you can't eat my body massage I'll water down my gospel [Music] that's why preachers need to have a backup because I tell you it is very easy for a preacher to feel like you should water down the world they water down the preaching of the world so that everyone comes in so that a wish will come and they will feel comfortable so so that fornicator will sit oh no they won't feel anything they don't even say this is my church and they will not leave they adulterers in other words I'll keep you entertained as long as you can open your pocket foreign but for as many as I have the seed of God hallelujah amen they will fight till one day they will reach that day this is my day surrender my life amen that's what the word does sanctify by the preaching of it but after you are Sanctified there is another thing that happens amen God comes down the form of the Holy ghosts we are now a new creation Chicago without the Holy Ghost you can never submit to this world don't lie yourself following laws and rules [Music] because the only thing he was requiring he was the oil yeah foreign [Music] hallelujah amen He blesses you as a sir no man you have all authority no man who can exercise everything that is spoken of you can act on behalf of your father [Applause] apparent to the throne um speak with the foreign foreign that will be all that you will do enough [Music] um foreign hallelujah amen for my authorities lost last will not you know overcome you okay you come to you Jesus was 100 man yes Jesus yes was tempted with all man of Temptation yes none of them defeated Hallelujah because you have the authority to do so come on and he says for these sons of the last day you see we were predestinated now here we are now this is what happened to cost us a little girl they say I got born again praise the Lord God holy ghosts that's fine you are a child of God that's fine [Applause] that is not what I'm talking about you were a predestinated and to adoption it is we have time for a few hours to go into the adoption to show you how God pulled his people out yeah and his son was adopted into the family after he was already his son um born in the family he become adopted in the family also he was a doctor he was taken out yeah and he put a white robe on him and he adopted into the same family he was born into now if we proved to be a fine man until he was of age and correctly about his father's business you were born into the same family even in the English let me let me just tell you this a little even the English oh in most of the royal families a son is Born Into the family but that sun is not immediately exercise all the authority of a son um [Music] what is what happens the father blesses him under a tutor foreign [Applause] [Music] by being about his father's business correctly behaving himself and learning everything he's been told and when the truth that now the Father the boy is of age he will take the final report will now adopt him as a full member of the family not only that he also adopts him as a son all of you I am proud of him that's the same thing God has done God done the same thing to his son to his son he took him apart and put him up on the mountains and there he overshadowed him when Jesus came on the earth yes he was the manifested son of the father yeah he had to prove his worthiness by going through the fire the Bible says he was perfected by the very things he suffered two kids and when he went through everything and then on the final hour the salary when he was on the mountains right there when he was crying right there and he said father I wish this cup was taken away from me it's fearful she cannot but then again he says and this is what every Son of God will do sometimes it's very hard for us to drink Jesus drunk the cup of suffering yes but he has given you the cup now what the teacher of faith it's not easy drink it don't throw it away Jesus prayed yes yes a prayer which was not answered there are some prayers that will never be answered if we're a Son of God God cannot answer you in a prayer that is outside of his word that's why we should never just pray to love our words if you are not a Bible reader you can never be a good prayer Warrior foreign said take this cup from me but as a good son you remember that this cup can't be taken out so he said according to your wings and the father was happy and the father was happy of Jesus and the voice spoke from Heaven this is my beloved Son what was that God blessing his own son charity he was already a son born into the kingdom is he blessed him yeah and God still places his children in his church Hallelujah God wants to bless you as a member all right we are not just arriving here we have always been in his mind he has always been a part of him that is why it is impossible for some of us to go to hell again it is impossible for us to live in this world like vagabonds because we have a purpose we have a life there's a lot of tummy Rod I'm sorry to use that word that people are running after who are waiting to be in Japan go back in the world see and they give their entire life to eat you members of our one body they're not different anyone suffered we all suffered We Are Family you see all these what subgroups you are on what's up oh someone tell me pastor preaching we can't even put one eye there because if you put one eye there he will ask you whether you remember things that are Abominations I think we as Believers that has 200 2 000 100 messages on a believer's chat group messages none of my business foreign everything I am nothing in the church remember you are the body yeah and every member has something to do and I'll remember you might say well I don't enjoy that man's Ministries exactly what you need to never say the way he says certain things each of us God has made us in a different way brother Andrew has spoken here [Music] but every minister is a
