I mean, there's a bag that is lost. &gt;&gt; They say it's a cross bag, &gt;&gt; gray in color, has black spots. If you It's near your your seat, please. And they say, "Please return it and God will bless you. Look around. You never know, you know. &gt;&gt; And then uh there's also a brother says that uh I think there's the same thing, a cross back. So it is serious. There are two announcements. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the Lord richly bless you. Turn around and greet your brothers. We prepare to invite our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. How many believe that you're one of them? Amen. I love that song. It emphasizes that I'm one of them. And I'm glad I'm so glad to say it. And I'm one of them. Go tell your brother I'm one of them. Oh hallelujah. Well, there are people [singing and music] almost everywhere who sat flame with the [music and singing] fire that fell at Pentecost which cleans that made him clean [singing] in [music] his body and now within my heart. Oh glory to his name. I'm so glad that [singing] I can [music] see I'm one of them. And I'm one of them. I'm one of them. Oh, [singing] I'm so glad [music] that I can see I'm one of them. Oh, one of them. I'm [music] one of them. [singing] Oh, I'm so glad that I can [music] see I'm one of them. Though these people made the land, no [music and singing] one they have all received the pent in Jesus name. [music] And [singing] now both far and wide yet the same. I'm so glad that I can see [music] one [singing] of them. One of them. [music] I'm so glad that I can say I'm [music and singing] worthy. [singing] I'm so [music] [music] blessing now with your heart. [music] I will stand to his ring. I will set your name. He is [music and singing] now in my heart. Glory to his name.

So they [music] were gathered in the upper room all his name. They were baptized with Holy Ghost came [singing] for them [music] that day. He will do for you the same. [singing] I'm so glad that I can say I'm one [music] of them. Well, I'm one of them. One of them. &gt;&gt; Well, aren't you glad? I'm so glad that [music] I can say one of them. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm one of them. One of them. I'm so glad &gt;&gt; that I can see [singing and music] all these people. Sing it now. This people may not land no more struggle. [singing] [music] one day. Aren't you glad? I'm so glad [music] that I can say I'm one of the one of them. &gt;&gt; Aren't you glad? &gt;&gt; I'm so glad &gt;&gt; that I [music] can say I'm one of the [music] &gt;&gt; hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. Hey, are you one of them? &gt;&gt; You know, this is one of the most wonderful songs, you know, because you know, when you look around the room, you're looking at your brother, baptized in Jesus name filled with the Holy Ghost, the bride of Jesus Christ. Amen. Maybe black, blue, red, I don't know, white, but we are all one of them. children of one father who is the Lord. How many are looking forward to the word? &gt;&gt; Amen. I I just hope you're prayed up and expectant. And you know, I just wanted to say there's only so much you can say to uh to the public, but uh I just wanted to say this. I spent time with brother Josh. He took time off work some time of fellowship back in Brisbane and I can tell you brother Josh and so um it's just wonderful when you know you're going to hear from someone who is one of them. You can say all you want. But your life will show who you are. And the reason why I said that is because after spending I don't know I don't remember how many days perhaps a week or so I could tell he's one of them. Amen. And so [clears throat] let us receive him tonight. Amen. Another refreshing from heaven. We receive him with another song. uh God's attributes were manifested. If the brother can get the original life, this is a wonderful another wonderful story. God's attributes were manifested to his bride in this last age. [music] We have called a revelation by the last professed message and know who we are and what we raised up for. Now praise the Lord. Original life. Well, the original life, [music] original [singing] is what I believe. [music] The side [singing] of life is revealed. The seven seal [music] is unveiled. [singing] The original will see. Listen, we are the one made flesh [music] today. This is what the scriptures say. [singing] And our names are seen within redeemed and perfect [music] without [singing] sin. Yes, we are anointed by the God [singing] who is the original. The original [singing and music] seal. Praise God is what [music] I believe is the man is revealed. The seven seg where our eyes of understanding he has opened up our lives [music and singing] and with victory is ours. who had turned down in the past [music] to Jubilee a Sunday [singing] and we have responded to our God. Praise God. Who's the original life? The original life. The original seal. [music and singing] &gt;&gt; Oh, is what I believe [singing] is revealed. [music] The original.

[music] Lord, we want to thank you for everything you've done this day. But oh God, we want more of you. We want more of you in our lives, Lord. So God, may you come and open up your word to us, Lord. We commit all that's to be said and done into your hands. &gt;&gt; Come, oh God, and take control, we ask. In Jesus precious name. Amen. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'm very nervous, so let's just turn straight to the scripture. If anyone's ever stood at the altar and got married, you're more nervous than your wedding day. I want to read 1 Samuel chapter 16. when brother ti started stealing my sermon yesterday and I was sitting there and I said Lord make him stop &gt;&gt; and then brother Michael &gt;&gt; he preached from Genesis to Revelations and I thought we'll be preaching from the maps in the back and I said Lord is there something left but here Here we are. &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 16 verse 13. I don't need to read it all. My brother already laid a beautiful groundwork for me. And it says, "Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his brethren, and the spirit of the Lord came upon David from that day forward." So Samuel rose up and went to Rama. Amen. word. You may take your seats. My wife texts me. I said, "I need to slow down for the interpreter. &gt;&gt; So pray for me." I want to really appreciate that message from Brother Michael. I know his life has challenges and hardships. So when he preaches, it comes from a position of experience. And when he was saying they took me to Compala, I had to hold my hand to cross the road. And every eye was on me. There goes this tall redhead man. And they can all see me. Quite the experience. So as we read in the scripture, &gt;&gt; as we know Saul was a backslid, moody, &gt;&gt; jealous, he was a disobedient king, &gt;&gt; even though he was anointed with oil. And as we found out yesterday, the oil never brought him to his purpose. Saul was the one that should have been facing the giant. This was the king. He was the leader. He was head and shoulders above every other man. He was the one with the suit of armor. He was the one that should have been facing Goliath. But because of disobedience, the kingdom was taken away from them. I don't want to be alive and not know why. I want to know the reason that God has placed me on the face of this earth. I don't want to go through life successful in the wrong thing. It doesn't matter how much money I accumulate. Life I never knew him. But I want to speak on facing life with the anointing oil. It's amazing when you look at David. Here's a man that was anointed king around the age of 10 to 15 years old. Young man in front of him. And with the anointing, it came with a realization of his purpose. He could walk out and face the bear, the lion. No, that animal cannot throne my destiny. Scripture, Satan is going to like a roaring lion seeking whom he can devour. But with the anointing in the believer, &gt;&gt; YOU CAN STAND AGAINST THE LION. You can stand against the devil. &gt;&gt; So no matter what comes your way, KNOWING THE THRONE IS MY PURPOSE. So as a believer, we know where WE COME FROM. WE KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING. BUT THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF GROUND IN THE MIDDLE THAT IS UNCERTAINTY alpha with the omega. &gt;&gt; But there in the middle there's A LITTLE BIT OF GROUND THAT WE GET A BIT UNSURE. He said I will be with YOU until the end OF THE EARTH. SO IT REQUIRES FAITH IN THE MIDDLE GROUND WHEN there's a lion STAND WHEN EVERYTHING WANTS TO SEE YOU DESTROY. DAVID KNEW NO MATTER HOW MY LIFE GOES ALONE is my destiny. COULD YOU IMAGINE IF YOU CATCH YOUR PURPOSE? NO MATTER WHAT YOU FACE IN LIFE. WALK THROUGH IT knowing that all things TOGETHER ARE GOOD TO BRING the call of the Lord. YOU'RE NOT JUST HERE DRIFTING THROUGH LIFE FACING RANDOM SITUATIONS YOU FACE IN ORDER OF THE LORD YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE. AMEN. And the only WAY AS A YOUNG PERSON TO SURVIVE IN THE WORLD TODAY HAVE THAT ANOINTING. You might have been BORN IN THE MESSAGE. THE anointing because we are in a day where information is so available. Sin is so available. If I go to the shopping center and I'm walking, there's sin. THERE'S ADVERTISEMENTS of half-dressed women. Walk that way. THERE'S SOMEONE NOT DRESSED. PROBABLY not dressed. I SAY I'M GOING TO LOOK AT THE GROUND AND WALK THERE. Look at the ground. Picture on the ground. Amen. Amen. Sin is everywhere you go. WHEN I'M ALONE IN MY BEDROOM, SIN IS AVAILABLE. WHEN I WALK DOWN THE STREET, SIN IS AVAILABLE. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN I KNOW WHO I AM, WHEN I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM, I DON'T NEED TO LOOK AT THE SIN. SIN DOESN'T DEFINE ME. JESUS SACRIFICE AT CALVARY defines me. SO YOUR PHONE, MY YOUNG BROTHER, YOUR PHONE CAN BE USED FOR GOOD OR FOR EVIL. THE POWER IS IN YOU. YOU MUST CHOOSE. YOU MUST DECIDE. WHAT ROAD WILL I WALK? AMEN. &gt;&gt; And there's David. Am I going slow enough? Am I going slow enough? &gt;&gt; Good. Good. I'm not used to interpreter. So, here's David. He hears about Goliath. HERE'S DAVID ABOUT 16 YEARS OLD. HE'S NOT AN OLD MAN. HE'S A YOUNG MAN. HE'S GOT NO TRAINING. HE'S JUST A SHEPHERD. [laughter] AND HE IS GOLIATH. GOLIATH MAY BE A FOOT OR TWO TALLER THAN HIM. maybe weighs three times WHAT DAVID WEIGHS, &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, "I KNOW WHO I AM." AND IT DOESN'T MATTER ABOUT THIS PHILISTINE. SOMEBODY MUST TAKE A STAND. GOD IS LOOKING FOR A LEADER THAT CAN SAY WHEN THEY WANT TO WALK AWAY, I WILL FACE GOLIATH BECAUSE HE CAN'T TAKE ME DOWN. THE THRONE IS MY PURPOSE. THE THRONE IS MY DESTINY. IF GOLIATH FALLS ON DAVID, DAVID SAID, "WHAT CHANCE DOES A SHEPHERD HAVE?" BUT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THAT DAVID TOOK THAT SLING, HE MADE SURE NOT TO AIM BECAUSE HE KNEW IF HE AIMED, &gt;&gt; HE WOULD MISS. SOMETIMES WE TRY SO HARD. GOD SAYS JUST BELIEVE IN YOUR DESTINY. Just believe in your purpose. AND DAVID SAID, "I CAN GO THROUGH ALL THINGS KNOWING THE THRONE IS MY PURPOSE. WHAT can I say? I AM ALIVE AND I KNOW WHY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; FAITH. WHAT DROVE DAVID TO TAKE GOLIATH? &gt;&gt; Faith in his God called position. SO WHEN SATAN COMES AGAINST YOU AND SAYS TRIES TO TEMPT YOU TO GO A certain way, THE ONLY THING THAT WILL HOLD YOU IS FAITH IN YOUR POSITION. YOU MUST KNOW &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU COME FROM, &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU'RE GOING. AND SATAN CANNOT GET MY SOUL. &gt;&gt; MY SOUL IS ETERNAL. I CAN'T DIE. THE THRONE IS MY DESTINY. It's amazing when you look at David's life. HE WOULD SAY, "Doesn't matter what happens in Ziglag. The throne is my destiny. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS WITH MY FATHER-IN-LAW. Hope my father-in-law is not watching." He said, "I CAN GO THROUGH ALL THINGS." I suppose I should say just in case it gets back &gt;&gt; I have the best father-in-law. Amen. &gt;&gt; But David, we know the story of Ziglag. This whole day wasn't a complete write off because something bad happened. BUT SO MANY TIMES AS BELIEVERS WHEN WE GET SOME BAD NEWS, OUR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE FALLS APART. DAVID DIDN'T THROW A TANTRUM. IS THAT A WORD? HE DIDN'T CRY IN THE CORNER. HE DIDN'T SAY, "HOW CAN THIS HAPPEN TO ME? I AM TO BE KING. THIS SHOULDN'T BE HAPPENING TO ME." BUT HE KNEW WHO HE WAS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE STRENGTHENED HIMSELF IN THE LORD YOU MUST HAVE ENOUGH OF GOD IN YOU THAT WHEN THE BAD NEWS COMES AND YOUR FRIENDS WANT TO STONE YOU. YOU SAY, "OH GOD, THE THRONE [screaming] IS MY PURPOSE. THAT'S WHAT I WANT. I DON'T WANT TO BE DRIFTING THROUGH LIFE, &gt;&gt; DRIFTING THIS WAY, &gt;&gt; DRIFTING THAT WAY, BUT I WANT SOMETHING STEADFAST, &gt;&gt; SOMETHING SURE. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT GOD DOESN'T LOVE ME, BUT A MATURE CHRISTIAN SAYS, "I WENT THROUGH THIS BECAUSE GOD LOVES ME." &gt;&gt; THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THAT CHILDREN CAN STAND THE CHASTENING. GOD HAS A PLAN for your life. EVERYTHING YOU GO THROUGH IS TO DRIVE YOU TO YOUR PURPOSE. It's very easy for me to stand here and SAY THAT. BUT WHEN I'M OUT THERE AND SOMETHING HAPPENS I DON'T LIKE, what now? &gt;&gt; CAN YOU STAND IN THAT MOMENT? CAN YOU STAND WHEN YOUR LIFE is falling apart? &gt;&gt; Can you LOOK AT THE GIANT &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "THE GIANT IS JUST A A SPEED HUMP ON MY WAY TO MY DESTINY." &gt;&gt; THE GIANT IS A CHARACTER BUILDING SPEED HUMP. YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SLOW DOWN FOR A LITTLE BIT, BUT ON THE OTHER SIDE, JOY COMES IN THE MORNING. &gt;&gt; IF YOU CAN JUST GO THROUGH THE NIGHT, THE SUN SHALL RISE AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SO NO MATTER IF YOU'RE FACING YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW, [screaming] &gt;&gt; THE AMALACHITES, WHETHER YOU'RE HAVING A ZIGLAG MOMENT, &gt;&gt; THE PATH TO THE THRONE IS A TOUGH PATH. DAVID WAS HUNGRY. HE WANTED THE WATERS of Bethlehem. YOU'RE NOT JUST GOING THROUGH STUFF. THERE'S A PURPOSE TO THE PAIN and it's easy TO SAY THAT NOW. BUT WHEN YOU GO OUT THERE AND THE DOCTOR rings and SAYS THE DOCTOR RINGS AND SAYS there sickness, there's cancer is in your body. You have enough of God IN YOU TO STAND IN THAT MOMENT AND SAY BY HIS STRIPES I AM HEALED. &gt;&gt; LET ANYTHING COME I AM HIDDEN IN THE ROCK. AND WHEN YOU READ THE GOSPELS, &gt;&gt; Jesus would say, &gt;&gt; John was the greatest OF ALL THE PROPHETS. BUT I SAY UNTO YOU, THE LEAST IN THE KINGDOM IS GREATER THAN JOHN. I WANT A REVELATION OF THAT SCRIPTURE. AMEN. And brother Brandon would say, &gt;&gt; he says, "You have more authority than an ARCHANGEL BECAUSE HE SAYS AN ARCHANGEL IS A SERVANT, BUT YOU ARE a son." And he says, "WHEN THE WEAKEST CHRISTIAN GETS DOWN ON THEIR KNEES, YOU MIGHT NOT FEEL LIKE MUCH, BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN ON YOUR KNEES, HELL'S FOUNDATIONS START TO SHAKE." AND YOU CAN PRAY AND SAY, "GOD, THOUGH I'M WALKING A HARD PATH, I KNOW THE THRONE [screaming] IS MY PURPOSE. GOD IS LOOKING FOR A WITNESS THAT CAN STAND IN THE HARD TIMES THAT WHEN WE GET TO THE JUDGMENT, GOD CAN TURN TO YOU AND SAY, "HERE IS MY WITNESS." THAT WHEN IT ALL FELL APART, I HAD ONE WHO STOOD AND STRENGTHENED THEMSELVES IN THE LORD. I WANT TO KNOW WHEN I PRAY, &gt;&gt; HEAVEN IS LISTENING. THAT WHEN I PRAY, HELL'S FOUNDATIONS ARE SHAKING. &gt;&gt; That's the revelation I WANT. AND IF YOU HAVE THAT, &gt;&gt; COME THE GIANT, &gt;&gt; COME WHAT? MAY, I can overcome all things. Amen. So, can I say while you're at camp? While you're at CAMP ON THE MOUNTAIN, GET TO KNOW HIM. GET AN EXPERIENCE WITH GOD BECAUSE IN THE VALLEY YOU NEED TO KNOW HIM. SO CAN I SAY GET TO KNOW HIM ON THE MOUNTAIN SO YOU KNOW HIM IN THE VALLEY THAT NO MATTER WHAT COMES THERE IS A VALLEY COMING WHEN YOU WALK OUT THE DOORS SATAN WILL TEST YOU ON EVERYTHING YOU HEAR HERE. SO CAN I SAY A VALLEY IS COMING, SICKNESS IS COMING, BUT GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME THAN ANYTHING THAT IS IN THE WORLD. And if YOU GET THAT REVELATION, YOU CAN WALK THROUGH LIFE VICTORIOUS. THERE'S THAT THAT REVELATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN CHURCH. THAT REVELATION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR MARRIAGE. BECAUSE WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; YOUR MARRIAGE WILL LINE UP WITH THE WORD. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE, &gt;&gt; YOU WILL GO TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SAY, "PREACHER, BROTHER JOSH, &gt;&gt; I'M DOING MY BEST." AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; The amazing thing about temptations, temptations are a must FOR A BELIEVER. BECAUSE he who overcomes will inherit. &gt;&gt; SO WITHOUT THE TEMPTATION THERE IS NO OVERCOMING. HUMAN NATURE DOESN'T LIKE THE TRIAL BUT WITHOUT THE TRIAL THERE'S NO OVERCOMING. SO I SAY LORD BE IT UNTO ME. I DON'T LIKE IT BUT BE IT UNTO ME. And the amazing thing for A TEMPTATION, A TEMPTATION HAS TO BE SOMETHING AVAILABLE, A TEMPTATION HAS TO BE SOMETHING YOU WANT. Eating Brussels SPROUTS IS NOT A TEMPTATION. BRUSSELS SPROUTS, you don't have THAT PUMPKIN. EATING PUMPKIN IS NOT A TEMPTATION. SOME VEGETABLES ARE DISGUSTING. Some vegetables are disgusting. It's not It's not a temptation. Eating eating that is not a temptation. But if it's a nice steak dinner, &gt;&gt; it's available. and I want it AND I AND I SHOULDN'T be eating it. IT'S NOW A TEMPTATION. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN SEE WHATEVER that sin is in your life, THAT TEMPTATION IN YOUR LIFE THAT YOU WANT THAT IS AVAILABLE. THAT IS THE THING YOU MUST OVERCOME. AMEN. BUT TO HIM THAT OVERCOMEMETH WILL INHERIT ALL THINGS. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS AND BROTHER WOULD SAY ALL THINGS IS THE BRIDE. WHAT ARE YOU INHERITING THE REVELATION OF WHO YOU ARE? Just overcome. IT'S EASY TO SAY NOW. WHEN YOU WALK OUT THERE &gt;&gt; and it's available, there's when the trial starts. &gt;&gt; And let me tell you what a Brussels sprout is. &gt;&gt; You know what a cabbage is? It's about this big, but looks like a cabbage. I don't know who invented it. It's not good. And some people like it. We pray for those people. &gt;&gt; I'm getting too comfortable. But the amazing thing is the new birth brings the ability to overcome. As I said yesterday, before the new birth, I did whatever I wanted to do. But now with the new birth, it comes with a desire to stand. AND the scripture says in Proverbs 24, it says, "The righteous man falls seven times. We are the generation OF THE RIGHTEOUS. BUT IT SAYS, AND I'M PARAPHRASING, BUT IT SAYS THE UNRIGHTEOUS MAN FALLS INTO MISCHIEF. HE STAYS THERE. But the RIGHTEOUS MAN, HE FALLS SEVEN TIMES BECAUSE HE GETS BACK UP AGAIN. WHAT IS AN OVERCOMER? IT IS SOMEONE WHO GETS UP AGAIN WHEN YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE GETTING UP AGAIN. THERE'S A CONVICTION IN THE HEART THAT SAYS, "I MUST GET BACK UP AGAIN." &gt;&gt; Oh my. &gt;&gt; Amen. COME ON, DAVID. GET BACK up again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But as parents, and I'm sure there's a lot of young people here, we try WE TRY TO SHELTER OUR CHILDREN to such a point that it makes life harder for the child. We try to wrap the child in cotton wool. We try TO PUT THEM IN A LITTLE HOUSE AND leave them there. BUT WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY GO AND WORK. &gt;&gt; THEY REACH THE AGE WHERE THEY GO TO UNIVERSITY. &gt;&gt; AND SUDDENLY THERE'S A WHOLE ARRAY OF TEMPTATIONS. THEY'RE NOT BUILT UP TO FACE THE TEMPTATION. SUDDENLY SIN IS ENTICING. BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY SIN IS BEAUTIFUL. &gt;&gt; And if you SAY IT'S NOT, WILL CAST THAT LYING SPIRIT out of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I come to find out in my own childhood, &gt;&gt; I grew up in the message, those who weren't here yesterday, &gt;&gt; THAT GETTING YOUR CHILD TO conform to the dos and don'ts of the MESSAGE will not protect them from sin. I HAVE THREE CHILDREN. AS A PARENT, I would do whatever I COULD TO PROT PROTECT MY CHILD FROM SIN. I WISH I COULD PROTECT THEM FROM THE SINFUL DESIRES OF THE WORLD, but I DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE DESIRE OF THE CHILD, but I have A SECRET WEAPON THAT WHEN MY CHILD IS GOING ASTRAY, I CAN PRAY. AND BROTHER RANDOM WOULD SAY, "IF YOU WANT YOUR LOVED ONES SAVED, PRAY. SOMETIMES WE LOOK FOR SOMETHING SO DEEP AND FAR OFF, BUT HE SAYS, "PRAY for them." &gt;&gt; Adding our own interpretation TO THE MESSAGE WILL not protect our children from sin. Growing up in the message, I thought, "WE'RE IN THE MESSAGE. THERE'S NO TEMPTATION." But then I went out into the world. I never left church GOING CHURCH BUT I WENT AND GOT A JOB. &gt;&gt; I WENT AND became a a I went to work suddenly all the temptations are there and there come a time back home in the church there where I grew up there was about 30 or 40 young people &gt;&gt; friends of mine pastor's children, deacon's children, uh the preachers children. ONE BY ONE, SATAN COME in started to pull each one of them out. And I WAS SITTING THERE WATCHING THIS and I SAID, "LORD, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?" AND I THOUGHT I KNEW HIM REAL WELL because I grew up in the message. I thought I HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM BECAUSE I WENT TO FOUR SERVICES A WEEK. I WENT TO ALL THE CAMPS. I WENT TO PRAYER MEETING WHEN THE OTHERS WOULDN'T GO. I thought I WAS REAL SPIRITUAL. I'M IN THE MESSAGE. BUT WHEN MY FRIENDS STARTED TO WALK AWAY, &gt;&gt; there's a PULL ON ME THAT SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU ALSO GO?" &gt;&gt; And I was sitting I WAS SITTING IN CHURCH. I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE I WAS SITTING. And I was praying. I SAID, "LORD, THIS WAS MY LAST SERVICE. I'M DONE. I'M WALKING AWAY. I CAN'T LIVE THE LIE. I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU. &gt;&gt; I THOUGHT I HAD SOMETHING. BUT THEN I REALIZED I DIDN'T HAVE WHAT I THOUGHT I HAD. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL PULL EVERY BRICK AWAY FROM YOUR LIFE SO THAT YOUR EYES COME OFF EVERYTHING, YOUR FRIENDS, AND YOUR EYES GO ONTO HIM. AND I WAS JUST SITTING THERE. AND AS I WAS SITTING THERE, I SAID, "LORD, I'M DONE." 100% IN MY HEART. NO DESIRE TO BE A CHRISTIAN. NOTHING THERE. THERE'S NOTHING I COULD RELY ON. AND that was it. End of the meeting. Within 2 minutes I was going and the Lord spoke to me AND HE SAID, "DOESN'T MATTER WHERE YOU GO. DOESN'T MATTER WHATEVER YOU DO AS A TRUE SON OF GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS COMING BACK HOME." CAN I SAY I WAS THAT PRODICAL SON? &gt;&gt; I WAS ON THE WAY OUT THE DOOR. THAN GOD RICH [screaming] IN MERCY. HE CAME BY MY WAY. I HAD NO DESIRE FOR HIM. BUT HE CAME. &gt;&gt; HE TOUCHED THE SEED INSIDE OF ME. HE WATERED THE SEED. AND NOW WHAT YOU SEE IS BECAUSE THE GRACE OF GOD. AMEN. I MAY NOT HAVE SOME GREAT TESTIMONY WHERE GOD DRAGGED ME OUT OF THE WORLD, &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE A TESTIMONY &gt;&gt; OF THE KEEPING POWER of almighty GOD THAT WHEN I HAD NO DESIRE. He said, I SEE YOU THERE, YOU MIGHT COME HERE TO THIS CAMP WITH NO DESIRE FOR HIM. YOU MAY BE ON THE VERGE OF WALKING AWAY, BUT GOD SEES YOUR CRY. SO NO MATTER WHERE YOU GO AS A SON OF GOD, AS A DAUGHTER OF GOD, YOU'RE ALWAYS COMING BACK HOME. THERE'S A SEED INSIDE OF YOU THAT WILL HAUNT YOU ALL YOUR LIFE TILL YOU COME BACK TO YOUR POSITION. AMEN. I MAY NOT HAVE SOME GREAT TESTIMONY OF DELIVERANCE, BUT GOD SAVED MY SOUL. &gt;&gt; From that moment, &gt;&gt; did all my problems disappear? &gt;&gt; Oh, they got worse. Why? God was challenging my confession AND GOD WILL CHALLENGE YOUR CONFESSION. And I thought, I'm in THE MESSAGE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE THESE TEMPTATIONS. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH ME. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY UH MY MY MY CALLING. SOMETHING'S WRONG WITH MY EXPERIENCE. WHY AM I BEING TEMPTED? BUT I COME TO FIND OUT. &gt;&gt; THOSE THAT ARE CALLED OF GOD ARE TEMPTED. THEY'RE TRIED. &gt;&gt; SO YOU CAN STAND IN THE DARKEST OF TIMES. THE TRIALS DON'T GET EASIER. THEY GET HARDER. THEY GET HARDER. BUT YOU'RE STANDING AS A WITNESS. GOD HAS A PERSON THAT CAN STAND IN THE HARDEST OF TIMES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Receiving the Holy Ghost is just the start, let us go onto perfection. And if the scripture says, "Be ye therefore perfect," THE SCRIPTURE, GOD MUST MAKE A way for you TO FULFILL THE SCRIPTURE. HE DOESN'T JUST PUT THE SCRIPTURE OUT IN THE AIR AND SAY GOOD LUCK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; BUT WITH THE SCRIPTURE, HE PROVIDES A WAY FOR YOU TO COME INTO YOUR POSITION. I SEE A GLORIOUS CHURCH AND HE MAKES A WAY FOR YOU TO BECOME THE GLORIOUS CHURCH. God comes to your level. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we happy? &gt;&gt; We got to be happy. [cheering] &gt;&gt; In Romans chapter 7, &gt;&gt; this is Paul writing. Paul the Apostle. Paul had the Holy Ghost. Paul had more revelation than any other man THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE. SO IN ROMANS chapter 7 he starts writing and let me paraphrase the first few verses to save time but go and read it when you get a chance. He says in me is two persons. He says the inward wants to do right but the outward wants to do wrong. EVERY TIME I START TO DO RIGHT, wrong is there. EVIL IS PRESENT. &gt;&gt; And brother Random would say the outside IS CONTROLLED BY FIVE SENSES, but there's another sense of faith. SO WHEN THE FIVE SENSES ON THE outside are leading you into wrong, WE MUST RELY ON THE SENSE IN THE INSIDE. WE MUST STAY WITH FAITH. WE MUST STAY WITH OUR POSITION. AND BROTHER BRANDHAM would say, HE SAYS, "HOW?" SOMEONE ASKED HIM THE QUESTION, "HOW DO I KNOW IF MY THOUGHT IS GOOD, IF IT'S FROM SATAN OR THE OR GOD? AND HE SAYS, "IF IT IS GOOD, IT IS FROM GOD. IF IT IS BAD, IT IS FROM SATAN." HOW MANY TIMES WE COMPLICATE THINGS? THAT THOUGHT THAT'S PLAGUING YOUR MIND. IF IT'S GOOD, IT'S FROM GOD. IF IT'S BAD, IT'S FROM SATAN. And I said this last Wednesday, but let me say it again. I woke up the other day and Satan put this temptation into my mind and the most amazing thing happened. I just laughed. I just laughed. I said, "Satan, why bother?" What a moment. Amen. What a moment. So when the word says something and the five senses say it's not true, &gt;&gt; the five senses say it's not true. Amen. &gt;&gt; And faith says that's nothing but the truth. Take what faith said. &gt;&gt; So in Romans 7:1 17 Paul's writing Paul the great apostle. &gt;&gt; If you turn in your Bible to the Old Testament, you keep going. &gt;&gt; Romans 7. Romans 7:1 17 he says, "Now then it is no more that I do it. but sin that dwelleth in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not me that does it. &gt;&gt; It's a sin that dwelleth in me. This is Paul writing. This is Paul the Apostle. HE'S SAYING, "WHEN I want to do right, there's something with me that wants to do wrong." AND HE'S SAYING, "I HAVE TO OVERCOME THIS. I DON'T I DON'T GIVE IN TO THE SIN. I don't JUST SAY, "WELL, THERE'S SIN HERE. I WILL FOLLOW IT." BUT HE'S SAYING, "I MUST OVERCOME." &gt;&gt; THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH TEMPTATION. IT'S THERE. IT'S PRESENT. &gt;&gt; BUT IT IS NO MORE I THAT AM TEMPTED. &gt;&gt; IT IS THE FLESH THAT IS TEMPTED. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AS BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, &gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT SEEING THE REAL ME. &gt;&gt; THIS IS JUST A JACKET THAT I PUT ON ONE OF THESE DAYS. THIS JACKET IS GOING TO GIVE WAY AND I'M GOING TO TAKE MY FLIGHT TO A HEAVENLY HOME. BUT WHILE I'M HERE, LET ME FIGHT. LET ME OVERCOME. LET ME NEVER BOW TO SIN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Verse 19. FOR THE GOOD THAT I would do not, but the evil which I would not that I do. Sometimes we get stuck in the old English. So, let me put it like this. I want TO DO GOOD, BUT I JUST AIN'T doing it. &gt;&gt; I don't want TO DO BAD, &gt;&gt; BUT I'm doing it. That's what it says. &gt;&gt; But is no more I that do it. &gt;&gt; The scripture has to come with a revelation. He says, "I find then a law." Verse 21, &gt;&gt; verse 21, "I find then a law that when I would do good, evil is present with me. For I delight." How do I know I'm born again? For I delight in the law of of God after the inward member, after the inward man. But I see another law in my members, waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is IN MY MEMBERS. OH WRETCHED MAN THAT I AM who shall DELIVER ME FROM THIS BODY OF DEATH. BUT I [screaming] THANK GOD THROUGH JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD. SO THEN WITH THE MIND I MYSELF SERVE THE LAW OF GOD, BUT WITH the flesh, the law of sin, you become a walking, talking civil war. THERE'S TWO YOU'S IN HERE AND YOU'RE FIGHTING. Remember remember the old chief that come to brother Brandham &gt;&gt; and he said there's two there's two dogs fighting in here. Brother Brandham said what ONE IS WINNING? HE SAID IT IS THE one that I feed the most. SO I WONDER WHO ARE YOU FEEDING THE MOST MY YOUNG BROTHER? WHO ARE YOU FEEDING THE MOST MY YOUNG SISTER? WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE GOING A CERTAIN WAY WHO ARE YOU FEEDING? LET US FEED THE SPIRIT SO THE SPIRIT CAN TAKE THE INSIDE UNDER SUBJECTION TO THE LAW OF GOD. And then and then Paul Paul would get to Romans chapter 8 verse one. I bet when Paul read this scripture he had a little moment. There is therefore NOW NO condemnation to them WHICH ARE IN CHRIST JESUS WHO WALK NOT AFTER THE FLESH BUT AFTER the spirit. What a moment THAT MUST HAVE BEEN FOR PAUL. HE SAYS THERE'S CONVICTION IN THE BELIEVER, BUT THERE'S NO CONDEMNATION. THAT WHEN YOU SAY, "LORD GOD, FORGIVE ME." AS I said yesterday, AND I'LL SAY IT AGAIN, NOT SOME DRY EYED CONFESSION. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR HEART. WILL YOU SAY, "OH GOD, FORGIVE ME FOR THE WAY I WENT. FORGIVE ME FOR WHAT I DID. &gt;&gt; I CLAIM THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST. I CLAIM HIS MERCY. I CLAIM HIS GRACE. &gt;&gt; LET ME GO ON MY WAY. OH GOD. And from that time, leave it there. AND IF YOU GO BACK AGAIN AND SAY, "LORD, I prayed this yesterday, but let ME PRAY IT AGAIN. FORGIVE ME for what I DID YESTERDAY. &gt;&gt; GOD WILL LOOK AT YOU &gt;&gt; AND HE WILL SAY I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; HE DOESN'T HEAR YOUR VOICE. &gt;&gt; HE SEES THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; Aren't you thankful? &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU'RE FALLEN OVER, &gt;&gt; GET BACK UP AGAIN. THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION. CONDEMNATION IS WHEN SATAN COMES AND HE SAYS, "YOU'RE LAST. YOU'VE SINNED YOUR DAY OF GRACE AWAY. YOU'VE GOT NO HOPE. BUT THERE IS THEREFORE NOW NO CONDEMNATION. TO THEM WHO WALK AFTER THE SPIRIT, YOU MUST BE BORN AGAIN. WALK AFTER THE SPIRIT AND LET THE SPIRIT GUIDE YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. WE'RE ON A JOURNEY. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T START THIS JOURNEY WITH PERFECTION. YOU END THE JOURNEY. WITH PERFECTION. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AMEN. [applause] AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, if you've been in the message for 400 years and the same thing is still getting you, something is wrong somewhere. I'm talking about a believer on a journey. 400 YEARS TIME YOU SHOULD START OVERCOMING. YOU MIGHT FALL SEVEN TIMES, &gt;&gt; BUT WE'RE ON A JOURNEY. AFTER A WHILE, SATAN DOESN'T get you THE FIRST TIME, HE GETS YOU THE SECOND TIME, BUT THEN THE NEXT TIME HE DOESN'T GET YOU AT ALL. WE'RE ON A JOURNEY UNTO PERFECTION. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T LET SATAN CONDEMN YOU FOR SOMETHING UNDER THE BLOOD. &gt;&gt; THERE'S A THERE'S A SIGN ON THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGETFULNESS. IT SAYS NO FISHING. Leave it under the blood. DON'T DRAG IT BACK OUT AND SAY, "GOD, I REQUIRE FORGIVENESS AGAIN. LEAVE IT UNDER [screaming] THE BLOOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. GLORY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Revelation points to this verse. &gt;&gt; I know who I am. &gt;&gt; And if Satan can get you looking at the sin, the mistake, the temptation, THE TRIAL, YOUR EYE IS NOT ON THE THRONE. DAVID HAD TO KEEP HIS EYE ON THE THRONE. THAT REGARDLESS WHAT HE WENT THROUGH, THE THRONE IS my purpose. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandon was so excited. &gt;&gt; What a day it was when I discovered I WAS NOT THE SON of Charles and Ella Brham. I COME FROM A HOME BEYOND THE SEA. I'M SO THANKFUL THAT THE ALCOHOL PROBLEMS IN MY FAMILY, &gt;&gt; THAT'S NOT MY DNA. I COME FROM across the river. &gt;&gt; Do I have 10 minutes? &gt;&gt; In 10 minutes. All right, let's do this. &gt;&gt; Can I put it like this? The spirit you &gt;&gt; repents for what the flesh you did. &gt;&gt; You are a walking, talking civil war. We're on a journey. We must overcome. &gt;&gt; Knowing there is grace doesn't mean you don't need to overcome. BUT BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY, &gt;&gt; IF YOU GO THROUGH LIFE GOING GRACE, GRACE, GRACE, YOU TURN grace into a disgrace. We never want to TURN GRACE INTO A DISGRACE. BUT WE WANT TO SAY, LORD, GIVE ME STRENGTH TO OVERCOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then brother Brandon would say, &gt;&gt; NO MATTER WHAT HE'S DONE, THE BLOOD COVERS HIM &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS, "NO, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT." &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, "YOU ARE PERFECTLY ABSOLUTELY &gt;&gt; AMEN SINLESS BEFORE GOD. YOU CANNOT GET ANY MORE OF A COVERING THAN PERFECTLY, ABSOLUTELY. THERE'S NO CHANCE. THE BLOOD HAS COVERED YOU. AMEN. AND THEN PAUL PAUL WOULD WRITE Paul writes and he says where sin abounds grace much more abound. But I don't want to walk through life saying grace grace grace. Let me come into my POSITION AND SAY THANK YOU LORD FOR GRACE BUT LET ME MOVE ON WITH AUTHORITY TO THE THRONE. I DON'T WANT TO WALK I DON'T WANT TO WALK THROUGH LIFE TRIPPING UP OVER SIN BEHIND ME. IT IS BEHIND ME. &gt;&gt; I'M moving forward. Amen. Don't trip over condemnation. Let me read this. Brother Brandon would say in the church age book, &gt;&gt; he says, "The heavenly bridegroom created his own bride." That's amazing. IF I COULD CREATE my own bride. Yes, brothers. Come on. WHAT WOULD WE DO? &gt;&gt; SHE WOULD COOK REAL WELL. SHE WOULD BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL sister the WORLD HAS EVER SEEN. Her family would have a lot of money. I want some sort of inheritance here and she would have a great character. &gt;&gt; Of course, I would create my wife. Now, in case she's watching, &gt;&gt; every brother says, "Yeah, that's right." &gt;&gt; Every married brother would create their wife just LIKE SHE IS. WE WOULDN'T CHANGE A THING. &gt;&gt; I don't know if she's watching. Oh my sisters, if you could create your own husband, &gt;&gt; I wonder what he would be like. &gt;&gt; Oh, he would be handsome. HE'D BE RICH. HE'D BE good-look and a great character, a great Christian. So, brother Brandon would say, "God created his own wife and he created you with your issues, &gt;&gt; the trials, &gt;&gt; the temptations. God with a great created ability. God who could have made you in any WAY HE WANTED. HE COULD HAVE PLACED A GREAT OVERCOMING ABILITY IN YOU. OR HE COULD HAVE MADE IT POSSIBLE THAT SIN HAD NEVER TEMPTED YOU. &gt;&gt; HE COULD HAVE GIVEN YOU THE CHARACTER OF THE QUEEN OF HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; BUT HE SAYS, "I IN MY WISDOM HAVE CREATED YOU IN YOUR SHORTCOMINGS WITH YOUR WAYS WHERE YOU GO ASTRAY SOMETIMES." AND HE SAYS, "I HAVE CREATED YOU." SO MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING AT OURSELF A LITTLE BIT WRONG. WHEN GOD CREATED YOU, &gt;&gt; GOD CREATED THE BEST. &gt;&gt; He could have MADE YOU ANY WAY HE CHOSE, BUT HE MADE YOU LOOK LIKE YOU LOOK. HE MADE YOU WITH THE DESIRES THAT YOU HAVE. HE PLACED YOU WHERE YOU ARE. BUT THROUGH HIS WORK, HE SAYS, "I'M TAKING A CHARACTERFILLED BRIDE. I'M TAKING THE GLORY." HE NEVER JUST POPPED YOU THROUGH A PIPE AND SAID, "BLESSED IS HE WHO OVERCOMES." BROTHER BRHAM WOULD BROTHER BRHAM WOULD SAY, "YOU NEVER OVERCOME NOTHING, &gt;&gt; BUT HE WHO OVERCOMES &gt;&gt; WILL I GRANT TO SIT WITH ME. IN MY [screaming] THRONE. I'M TALKING ABOUT THE BRIDE. I'M TALKING ABOUT YOUR POSITION IN THE THRONE. SO MAYBE YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOURSELF WRONG. WHEN GOD CREATED YOU, HE CREATED THE BEST. NEVER LET SATAN TELL YOU &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SECOND BEST. NEVER LET SATAN TELL YOU YOU'RE LOST. &gt;&gt; GOD HAS PREDESTINATED YOU &gt;&gt; INTO A POSITION INTO A POSITION THAT YOU CAN RULE and reign with him. Amen. But God looks at YOU AND HE SITS back and says, "I made my own bride." Amen. &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we think our opinions are so good. &gt;&gt; I think God would have done it a little bit different. You know, but God says my ways are higher than your ways. Stop looking at ourself THE WAY WE ARE AND LOOK AT our look at ourself the way he looks at you. &gt;&gt; And if you can LOOK AT YOU THE WAY HE LOOKS AT YOU, WHAT IS THE TEMPTATION THEN? WHAT IS THE TRIAL? THEN you need a revelation of who you are. &gt;&gt; I no longer CALL YOU CHURCH. I CALL YOU BRIDE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WITH THE TRIAL, THE TEMPTATION, HE PROVIDES A WAY OUT. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS HE WILL NOT TEST YOU. HE WILL NOT TRY YOU ABOVE WHAT YOU ARE ABLE TO STAND. BUT WITH THE TRIAL, HE MAKES A WAY OF ESCAPE. We thank the Lord. You must have a little bit of bad in YOU to be a good person. Why? Why? &gt;&gt; God has angels and their righteousness before him is as filthy rags. But you must have bad in you to be a good person. If you had no bad, you'd be an angel. God already HAS ANGELS. HE WANTS YOU. HE WANTS YOU WITH YOUR ISSUES. YOU WITH YOUR TRIALS. &gt;&gt; YOU WITH THAT SIN THAT SO EASILY BESETS YOU. &gt;&gt; HE WANTS YOU WITH YOUR BAD. THAT DESIRE THAT WANTS TO GO INTO THE WORLD. GOD WANTS YOU. &gt;&gt; SO LET THE GOOD OVERCOME THE BAD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE BECOMING THE ANSWER TO THE DEVIL'S QUESTION. WHEN HE SAYS, &gt;&gt; "NOBODY CAN STAND IN SATAN'S EDEN." &gt;&gt; GOD SAYS, "HAVE YOU CONSIDERED JOB?" &gt;&gt; AND THERE STEPS FORWARD A BROTHER. THERE STEPS FORWARD A SISTER. SAY, "OH GOD, ME WITH MY BAD. I'M STANDING IN SATAN'S EU. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; RIGHT. &gt;&gt; Let me close somewhere. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon would say in questions and answers. &gt;&gt; He says, "And as long as you're in this life, you're going to be sticky sticky and have A CARNAL NATURE THAT'S GOING TO bother you as long as you're going to live. But in the inside of you, HE SAYS YOU ARE BORN AGAIN. And when you are raised up, you're in THE LIKENESS OF CHRIST AND ALL THE SIN HAS GONE FROM YOU. So who are you? So overcoming is not a gift, it's a victory. &gt;&gt; STOP JUDGING YOURSELF. STOP JUDGING YOUR eternal destination on your report card. I prayed three times. I didn't look at that thing. I'm going heaven today. Tomorrow I'm not going heaven no more. Has anyone ever been there? &gt;&gt; Sometimes I feel unsaved. Sometimes I feel saved. &gt;&gt; DON'T ASK me what's going on. Ask me what the word says. [cheering] Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me introduce grace. &gt;&gt; Goodness, it's hard to close. Nothing gives prevailing power over the devil like revelation. So don't fall off a mountain because of something. Get back on the mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when God created you, he created THE BEST. AND IT defies human logic. Defies human logic. &gt;&gt; But let me close with this. You know, I'm just battling the wind here. Maybe the tablet's the way to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. But when Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, &gt;&gt; these are three people, they didn't have the Holy Ghost, but they had something that they stood in Babylon &gt;&gt; that when there was a temptation that came and Nebuchadnezzar said, when you hear the music playing, the trumpet, the drums, the guitar, the piano, HE SAID, I WANT YOU TO FALL DOWN AND WORSHIPED A STATUE. SO OFF WENT THE MUSIC. SHADRACH, MESHACH, and Abedneo SAID, "NO CHANCE WILL I BOW TO THE WORLD." AND SO they dragged before an angry king. AND NEBUCHADNEZZAR SAYS, "I AM A KING OF MERCY. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ONE MORE CHANCE. LET THE MUSIC GO." AND SHADRACH SAID, &gt;&gt; "JUST A MINUTE, KING. LET'S NOT WASTE OUR TIME. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHO [screaming] I AM. &gt;&gt; DON'T BOTHER GIVING ME A TEMPTATION. I'M GOING TO STAND." THEY LOOKED STRAIGHT IN THE FACE OF THIS KING. HE WAS AN ANGRY KING. HE WAS A MAD MAN. AND THEY SAID, "NO. NO, &gt;&gt; WE WILL NOT BOW. &gt;&gt; WE WILL NOT BEND AND WE WILL NOT BURN. And Nebuchadnezzar said, "WHO IS THAT GOD [screaming] THAT SHALL DELIVER YOU OUT OF MY HANDS? &gt;&gt; I know a God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I like their answer. They said, "We are not careful to answer you in this matter. I don't care if I offend you. I'm staying with the word. Your friends will drag YOU ONE WAY. I WILL NOT GO. I WILL NOT BOW. YOU MUST BE DETERMINED. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW YOUR POSITION. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST KNOW THAT IF THIS EARTHLY TABERNACLE BE DISSOLVED, I'VE GOT ONE ALREADY WAITING. They say, "If not, GOD can deliver US FROM THE FURNACE. BUT IF NOT, I DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME. I WILL NOT [screaming] BOW. IF NOT, &gt;&gt; I WILL NOT BOW, &gt;&gt; GOD MAY NEVER TAKE ME THROUGH THINGS THAT I'M PRAYING FOR. &gt;&gt; BUT IF NOT, I WILL HOLD MY TESTIMONY. SOMETIMES WE PRAY, WE PRAY, LORD, HEAL MY BODY, BUT IF NOT, I'M STANDING IN SATAN'S EDEN. IS THERE A YOUNG PERSON HERE WHO FEELS A TEMPTATION but says, "I WILL NOT GO THAT WAY. I WILL NOT FOLLOW SIN. I'VE GOT A DESIRE TO GET MARRIED. BUT IF I NEVER GET MARRIED, if not, I WILL STAND. I WILL NOT GO IN THE WORLD TO FIND A WIFE. I WILL STAND FOR GOD. [screaming] &gt;&gt; IF HE NEVER GIVES TO ME THE DESIRE OF MY HEART, &gt;&gt; IF NOT, I KNOW WHO I AM. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I COME FROM. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I'M GOING TO. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Let's stand to our feet. Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what you've been praying for, Have faith. &gt;&gt; What if you never get it? Be determined to stand. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham would say in this in a sermon here, he says, "Give me a church that's so completely anointed with God till their every action and move is thus saith THE LORD." HE SAYS, "WALK IN THAT SHIKINA GLORY. AND I'LL SHOW YOU a Messiah, an anointed one of God standing upon the earth. &gt;&gt; SO, WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; WHO ARE YOU? &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD CREATED YOU, HE CREATED THE BEST. NEVER LET SATAN DRAG YOU INTO THE WORLD. YOU ARE A SON AND DAUGHTER OF GOD. STAND IN THE DAY WHEN NO ONE WANTS TO STAND. STAND FOR GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. [applause] [applause] &gt;&gt; AMEN. I will not bow. I will not bend. I will not burn. &gt;&gt; Amen. Where's brother Henry? Come and rescue the brother. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Poor interpreter. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There's a there's a quote that brother and and if you you don't mind standing for just a few moments. We've been seated long. There's a quote that brother Ken shared with me and I had a few that I was looking at already. Well, brother, if your your vocal cords can't work, I have more people. Don't you worry. Go go go and rest. Listen in in questions and answers 59. I &gt;&gt; I just want We've already heard the preaching. I'm just saying a few things here. Listen, he says, "What about that, brother Mike? Isn't that wonderful? Isn't that wonderful? He loved you. &gt;&gt; He loved you before there was a world. He know your nature. He know your weaknesses. He know your habits. Habits. He know all about you and what he was going to be. And then when he looked all over the great universe as it was, he said, "I choose you." And when he did that before there was ever a speck of light, then you are eternal with God. When you receive the Holy Ghost, then you become eternal. Because you are with God. You are a part of God. Can you see what I mean? You are eternal as God is. Praise the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And listen, you know, a brother, you know, threw a lot of nuggets there. &gt;&gt; He said, um, no matter what happens, the throne is my purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; The throne is my purpose. If God know knew all about me, but then he chose me. So no matter what happens, the throne is my purpose. The throne is my purpose. I believe that's what was in David's heart. No matter what happens, the throne is my purpose. You see, Revelation 1:6, "And he has made us kings and priests. unto God and to his father. To him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. And the prophet puts that in quotes and he says listen he has made us. &gt;&gt; Oh there are certain truth that we need to emphasize. This is one of them. Can we say amen to that? &gt;&gt; He. &gt;&gt; EVERYBODY SAY HE. &gt;&gt; HE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; Now when I whenever I read this I become emotional in my heart. He not me. He &gt;&gt; has made me. &gt;&gt; HE HAS MADE US. &gt;&gt; SALVATION IS HIS DOING. &gt;&gt; Salvation is OF THE LORD. ALL OF GRACE. HE REDEEMED ME. HE REDEEMED US FOR A PURPOSE. HE BROUGHT US FOR A PURPOSE. WE ARE KINGS. WE ARE SPIRITUAL KINGS. BUT WE are going to be kings on earth with him when he's seated on his throne. But right now, WE ARE SPIRITUAL KINGS AND WE REIGN OVER SPIRITUAL KINGDOM. That's why when your body IS BEGINNING TO BEHAVE, TO MISBEHAVE, YOU CAN TELL IT TO BEHAVE. WHY?
