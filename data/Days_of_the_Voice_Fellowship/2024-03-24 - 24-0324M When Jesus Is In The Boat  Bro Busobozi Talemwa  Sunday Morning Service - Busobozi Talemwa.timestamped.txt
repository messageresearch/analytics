[0:01] not in you know
[0:03] dogmas and I'm telling you that you know
[0:06] he has been before
[0:09] us and many times we worry about our
[0:14] life and right now I know many of you
[0:16] are worrying about
[0:18] your different aspects of your
[0:21] life can I make this
[0:25] personal can I bring you down to your
[0:28] level responding to me you're very
[0:33] quiet brother brother Sam can I bring
[0:35] you down to your
[0:36] level don't you I will not mention
[0:40] name
[0:42] amen right now in your
[0:44] life you wondering how am I going to
[0:48] navigate that
[0:49] area many times the past 11 years of our
[0:53] life marage
[0:55] rather I was looking
[0:58] back several
[1:01] times when my wife told me we do not
[1:03] have food in the
[1:06] house it's not a new thing for tell me
[1:10] that and I looked in my
[1:12] pocket I had no money I looked in
[1:16] another pocket I had no
[1:18] money and quite frankly there is none of
[1:21] you have ever borrowed
[1:24] from I don't believe in
[1:27] borrowing I am I because because
[1:30] borrowing takes away your
[1:33] blessings and I also don't believe in
[1:35] burdening
[1:36] [Music]
[1:38] Believers and so I don't usually do that
[1:42] I'm not saying I've never done it but
[1:44] I'm saying I don't usually do
[1:46] it if I the last time I did it I don't
[1:51] remember but what I have always
[1:54] answered is that God is in
[1:57] control I learn to say that maybe I said
[2:00] it to a few of you who were in
[2:03] trouble because I believe it God is
[2:06] always in
[2:07] control because he on the driver's
[2:10] seat I am not happening by
[2:13] mistake I was not born by
[2:16] mistake even the way I was
[2:19] born I was a
[2:21] winner do you know that that that there
[2:24] are many who wanted to be born at that
[2:28] moment egg of your mother was
[2:32] ready but as as seed came to that
[2:36] egg the many of your brothers and
[2:39] sisters who wanted to be
[2:42] born and they wanted to be born so bad
[2:46] that they R so
[2:48] fast oh praise God but let me tell you
[2:53] you were the only
[2:55] one you are the only one that turned out
[2:59] to be born
[3:01] so you are not here by
[3:04] mistake oh my God we are not here by
[3:07] mistake we are here by
[3:09] design it is not man and woman that
[3:12] determines a
[3:14] child God who determines a
[3:18] child even in all these science what
[3:20] they do it is God who
[3:23] deter it is God who determines a life to
[3:26] be
[3:28] born because he knows all those who are
[3:32] his yes there is serent seed and there
[3:34] is God seed
[3:36] on but I will tell you this the seed of
[3:41] God had to be manifested no matter
[3:45] what nothing could stop the seed of God
[3:48] from being
[3:50] manifested we have even seen children
[3:52] who have been thrown on
[3:56] dust and they almost died but God said
[3:59] no they will not die and he BR them out
[4:03] and and and you know they they rais they
[4:05] were they live and they were raised and
[4:09] they turned out to be great weapons in
[4:10] the hands
[4:12] of and those who just die at four years
[4:15] five
[4:18] years there's something I'm bringing to
[4:20] your
[4:21] understanding life is in the hands of
[4:24] God and it is God who determines
[4:27] life and there is no life that is a
[4:35] mistake and Jesus told the disciples
[4:39] follow me and they followed him and went
[4:41] into this
[4:42] boat and he and and and and and um you
[4:46] know he was in the boat with
[4:50] them he came in here before
[4:55] you where are you in poty he came in
[5:00] there before you where are you in need
[5:04] he came in there before you where are
[5:07] you in
[5:09] worry he came in before
[5:11] you where are you in lack of
[5:15] tution he lacked to he came in there
[5:19] before
[5:20] you I want you to I want you to come to
[5:22] a place of
[5:24] realiz there is no situation you will
[5:26] ever be
[5:28] in
[5:30] that you can say I'm number one to be
[5:36] like actually the Bible even says even
[5:40] Temptations He says he was even
[5:42] tempted with all man of
[5:45] Temptation take First Corinthians with
[5:47] me if you can vers 10
[5:49] vers 10
[5:51] verse3 he says there has not temptation
[5:54] taken you but such as is common to
[5:58] man
[6:00] [Music]
[6:01] but God is
[6:04] faithful who will not suffer you to be
[6:06] tempted above that ye are
[6:12] able but will with the Temptation also
[6:15] make a way to
[6:18] escape that you may be able to Bear
[6:22] it I say a faithful
[6:25] God Amen that he has been taken he says
[6:28] there's no temptation
[6:31] that is taken
[6:32] you but such as is common to
[6:35] man but God is faithful who will not
[6:37] suffer you to be tempted above that you
[6:39] are
[6:43] able but he says but with the Temptation
[6:46] also make a way of to
[6:51] escape that ye may be able to be
[6:57] it and down here in the Dy of Jesus
[7:02] Christ butam says these these
[7:06] words which are not read very
[7:09] often he says how was it God's
[7:13] blood God has blood how could it
[7:16] be because it was God's creative
[7:20] blood that he
[7:22] created in order to redeem
[7:25] us and he came and lived in the same
[7:28] body that he created
[7:32] therefore he could not God God had to
[7:34] suffer
[7:37] Temptation he had to suffer sexual
[7:44] Temptation he had to suffer all kinds of
[7:49] Temptation to be tempted by the
[7:52] devil in riches and
[7:55] Powers he had to be
[7:57] tempted in reach
[8:00] you had to be temped in Powers don't
[8:03] think you are the first one to desire to
[8:06] have
[8:08] power to desire to be
[8:11] rich to desire you know to have
[8:16] dominions he had to suffer all of
[8:20] that in order to do it he couldn't be as
[8:24] God in spirit he had to be God In the
[8:28] Flesh
[8:31] praise God God couldn't be God in the
[8:35] spirit if he couldn't be God In the
[8:40] Flesh that's why you also are in the
[8:44] flesh so you can go through the fear
[8:47] fness of Trials and
[8:50] temptations so that you can be a time
[8:52] tested tried son and daughter of
[8:58] God the Bible says that they that
[9:00] overcome will sit with
[9:03] him only the Overcomers will sit with
[9:07] him how can you overcome if you didn't
[9:12] fight Hallelujah are you hearing me am I
[9:15] preaching to someone this
[9:16] morning oh praise God there is no way
[9:20] you can sit with
[9:22] him in the seat of the
[9:25] Overcomers if you did not
[9:28] fight and many of us
[9:30] fight but we fight different
[9:33] battles there is a song which says some
[9:36] through the
[9:37] waters some through the fire some
[9:41] through the
[9:42] flood but all through the
[9:45] blood so we go through different
[9:48] Temptations we go through different
[9:50] Trials
[9:51] of these are to purify
[9:55] us but now when you are into that
[9:58] temptation say oh yeah this is mine I
[10:01] am I am in
[10:05] it done I will be like that until I go
[10:08] to the
[10:10] Rapture if you are like that until the
[10:12] Rapture you will not go to the
[10:15] rapture we are in a battle friends we we
[10:19] are in a battle against right and
[10:22] wrong amen we are between right and
[10:24] wrong
[10:25] brother we are fighting
[10:28] wrong and we are seeing right from the
[10:30] word of
[10:32] God maybe to some of you you have sexual
[10:37] battles maybe others you have battles
[10:40] with
[10:42] money when you see money saliva comes
[10:46] down and you know that is your
[10:50] Temptation then you will know that that
[10:52] is what you have to
[10:54] fight and until you overcome it do know
[10:58] you cannot go to the
[11:01] Raptor maybe some of you you being at
[11:04] broken and you're fighting the B of
[11:08] heartbreak until some of you are are
[11:11] saying I will never forgive that
[11:14] person I will never forgive
[11:17] that as long as you are like that forget
[11:21] the
[11:22] Rapture that is your cross to
[11:25] carry the Bible says carry your cross
[11:29] and follow
[11:31] Jesus if yours is
[11:33] unforgiveness you have to come to a
[11:36] place where amen you have to learn to
[11:40] forgive you pray until God brings
[11:44] forgiveness Brother Martin preached a
[11:46] masterpiece on
[11:50] Friday and he titled it whatt it the
[11:56] travail of the
[11:58] Soul until you come to that place where
[12:02] you
[12:03] travail like a mother who wants to give
[12:06] back you cannot
[12:08] say you won't say I have birth pains
[12:11] they will they will they will operate me
[12:13] as long as you are going to become
[12:16] prant you will have
[12:19] Trav you will have birth
[12:21] pains and so the Pains
[12:25] come when you about to bring forth life
[12:29] every one of us must have those
[12:32] B amen we are fighting the Battle of
[12:37] sin amen we are not
[12:40] rested every day we are fighting what
[12:43] are you fighting brother what are you
[12:45] fighting sister maybe you have hatred in
[12:48] your
[12:50] heart and you you just have it some of
[12:53] you have
[12:55] Envy others have jealousy just having
[12:58] jealousy
[13:00] you know jealousy when you feel bad for
[13:02] somebody who has
[13:05] prospered when you feel that someone has
[13:07] got
[13:08] something you feel that it should be
[13:10] yours not
[13:14] theirs that young man to buy such a
[13:18] suit it is not worth it would have been
[13:21] mine you don't speak them open but God
[13:24] sees them no wonder I've spoken them
[13:28] like this
[13:29] if you have ever spoken it
[13:32] was the Holy Spirit has spoken through
[13:35] my
[13:36] mouth don't say that I'm thinking I'm
[13:38] speaking my thoughts the word the word
[13:43] discerns it discerns your heart and it
[13:47] opens it before the Lord but the problem
[13:50] with this many people they don't repent
[13:55] they don't
[13:56] break they have hard heart
[13:59] you with the word hit with the
[14:03] word the more you heit it's as if you're
[14:05] hitting a St no wonder people don't
[14:08] change people have a b people
[14:12] don't people don't have the Holy Spirit
[14:15] people don't
[14:16] change yet preachers preach
[14:19] the what is going on in the
[14:22] church are so hard what brings
[14:26] that because they don't open up their
[14:28] heart
[14:30] but brother every time you open your
[14:31] heart when the word is preached and you
[14:34] welcome
[14:36] it you get pain and
[14:39] sorrow you get
[14:43] sorrow when a child brings you s
[14:47] pain when the time for giving birth
[14:50] is no matter what you do you have to
[14:52] give
[14:54] birth if you will not give birth you
[14:57] will give
[14:58] birth even if say you will not go to the
[15:01] nebor you at home you will give
[15:04] birth even if you're on the road you
[15:06] will give
[15:07] bir when you get that pain you get that
[15:12] pain child must be
[15:15] given most Christians they don't have
[15:18] that birth
[15:20] pain because they don't believe the
[15:23] word presid that pain is bad and it is
[15:27] also it is bad because it is painful but
[15:31] it is
[15:32] good because if you don't get it you
[15:34] can't give birth so when we feel the
[15:37] preacher is hammering
[15:38] us with a word don't walk out
[15:42] out don't feel bad don't close your ears
[15:47] just say
[15:48] Amen you are saying amen but you're like
[15:53] amen amen if it's a
[15:56] jealousy and you know you are jealous
[15:59] and forgiveness and you know you you
[16:02] have you have not forgiven some people
[16:03] in your
[16:05] heart
[16:07] for don't don't
[16:09] just that's not mine when you hear it
[16:13] say Amen Lord help me to forgive help me
[16:18] to to forgive you know this is what
[16:20] happens we all have our own
[16:23] battles we all fight things we all fight
[16:27] situations we are all fighting that's
[16:30] why the Bible calls us Christian
[16:33] Soldiers We Are Soldiers but our our
[16:37] enemy is
[16:38] sin and we are fighting against
[16:41] sin that is why we should love one
[16:44] another come here brother Joseph come
[16:47] here brother all right come come on come
[16:50] up three brothers all right so this
[16:51] brother is fighting I don't know what
[16:52] you are fighting you want to confess on
[16:55] the
[16:56] microphone come here brother come here
[17:00] hold your hands hold your
[17:02] hands you see you see we are right here
[17:06] all of us are
[17:08] fighting we can tell you brother what
[17:10] are you
[17:12] fighting no one is willing to tell us
[17:14] their
[17:15] battle you f
[17:22] whatty your
[17:24] Temptation now we are fighting whatever
[17:26] you
[17:27] fighting
[17:29] brother brother are you sure you don't
[17:31] fight Temptations last time I checked
[17:33] your
[17:36] okay we will not go
[17:39] there so you see
[17:44] fighting now when you begin boxing one
[17:47] another you know you begin now looking
[17:49] at other spoiling this one spoiling and
[17:51] then fighting against you will not
[17:55] overcome the devil has already trapped
[17:57] you but because we are all fighting we
[18:01] should love one
[18:02] another we should come together in
[18:05] prayer don't run don't run down
[18:09] somebody don't speak about them
[18:13] somewhere don't do
[18:15] that because when you do that you you
[18:18] you you are on the side of
[18:20] Satan you are now supporting sat and his
[18:25] agenda but when you hear something bad
[18:27] about a brother
[18:29] come to him tell brother I've had your
[18:33] fighting I've had you st brother is it
[18:37] true say yes brother I sto it was
[18:43] 50,000 me the other time I stole again
[18:48] even the other time brother I need
[18:50] prayer said brother come let us we are
[18:53] going to fast until you overcome but you
[18:57] who is speaking
[18:59] you are also fighting
[19:01] something so you are not
[19:03] better you are only better in the sense
[19:06] that the other one has been
[19:10] discovered the Bible says I didn't find
[19:12] that verse I didn't read it but it says
[19:13] in all points even as we
[19:17] are he went through what you were going
[19:19] through he first it and he overcame it
[19:24] so when you fight
[19:26] it you have to make a decision
[19:29] to overcome
[19:30] it how do you overcome it not once and
[19:34] forever you overcome it daily daily
[19:39] daily and how do you overcome it by
[19:42] Prayer by the word and by your testimony
[19:45] by your life every day is a fight every
[19:49] day is a
[19:52] fight if you want to know that someone
[19:54] is defeated by their
[19:57] temptation
[20:00] those people never
[20:03] pray I'm telling
[20:06] you if someone is living a defeated
[20:10] life they cannot
[20:12] pray they
[20:14] cannot I remember we used to have a
[20:17] family
[20:19] altar every day in my father's house but
[20:24] when my father my father was a
[20:26] priest and when he was defeated by
[20:30] Temptation one day he came
[20:33] back and you know he just went in the
[20:38] bedroom we came for time for
[20:41] prayer the man was not
[20:44] coming my mother had to
[20:46] go thank God for Godly mothers and
[20:51] women my mother went anded him from
[20:57] the and then
[21:01] father we going to pray and he sat in
[21:03] the
[21:04] chair and when he sat there the moment
[21:09] there do what you were doing there you
[21:12] started
[21:20] doing so is that a doing
[21:27] immedi so and first were children who
[21:31] could not wake him
[21:32] [Music]
[21:33] up so my mother was the
[21:37] one you know of course we were
[21:42] but and and my father oh yeah Hallelujah
[21:48] then then let us sing a
[21:51] song my father raised
[21:53] me he was one of the powerful preachers
[21:56] I've ever
[21:57] seen the Temptation got a hold
[22:01] of that's that's the situation he came
[22:05] in
[22:07] [Music]
[22:12] say and that situation
[22:15] continued for some
[22:18] time until much
[22:20] later we
[22:22] discovered what the problem
[22:25] was friends if you don't pray
[22:30] in your home we not talking about pray
[22:32] at
[22:33] church because here you can deceive us
[22:37] some of you are very
[22:39] good no we not talking about
[22:43] that I don't mean the general prayers
[22:49] everybody
[22:52] anointed
[22:57] hallu and then you watch this person at
[23:02] [Music]
[23:04] home doesn't have family alar doesn't
[23:08] read the word at home doesn't have
[23:10] private prayers with
[23:13] God you you are
[23:15] defeated you you you are saying your
[23:18] problem is marriage your problem is not
[23:21] marriage and let me tell you last if you
[23:25] young men and ladies if you're fighting
[23:27] with last
[23:29] you cannot overcome lust with
[23:33] marriage you cannot overcome lust with
[23:39] marriage before you get married overcome
[23:42] the spirit of
[23:45] L because if you don't overcome it with
[23:48] prayer even after marriage it will knock
[23:52] you
[23:53] down so you have to come to a place
[23:56] where you are living Victoria in
[24:00] Christ and then whatever you do will
[24:04] prosper so when we talk about
[24:06] Temptation Jesus suffered all of them
[24:10] but how did he overcome them he was a
[24:12] man of prayer this is the man who would
[24:15] go pray for hours and hours and
[24:21] hours but for us his
[24:23] followers we don't like
[24:25] prayer the devil that's why the devil
[24:28] fight
[24:30] to weaken our prayer
[24:34] life
[24:36] friends I want you to see
[24:39] something that we can't overcome our
[24:43] Temptation if we don't overcome if you
[24:45] don't
[24:47] pray and I trust that you don't leave
[24:49] this
[24:51] here let us go we you know every one of
[24:55] us has a a
[24:57] place
[24:58] you see the pastor you know has a vision
[25:02] for the
[25:03] church he gives brings studies and
[25:06] brings the word of
[25:07] God goes out
[25:10] preaches the evangelist go on the
[25:12] streets where's brother
[25:14] Marin he did a good job with brother the
[25:17] other day God bless you and you know
[25:21] brings the
[25:22] souls and then you know the the uh you
[25:25] know the singers sing musicians and they
[25:29] sing and play everybody but you see
[25:31] there is also for those who have or
[25:34] should have the the calling and the gift
[25:37] of
[25:39] intercession whereby they pray and
[25:43] without that all other departments in
[25:46] the body
[25:48] can we have to have
[25:51] intercessors people who intercede and
[25:54] there are some people who feel that
[25:55] because they interceding for others they
[25:57] are the best
[26:01] and and um so we have even and others
[26:04] who think they have gifts oh they want
[26:06] to begin ruling everybody with their
[26:10] gifts I've seen I've seen people with
[26:12] gifts come up and say well God showed me
[26:14] this you must do it and if you don't do
[26:15] it you
[26:19] Backle there's a woman who came up here
[26:21] one
[26:23] day and that's why we have to have the
[26:25] spirit of
[26:27] discernment
[26:29] and I had too much Liberty I don't know
[26:30] whether we are now streaming because
[26:32] some some things I don't see when
[26:35] we so so um now I will reduce what I
[26:39] wanted to tell you
[26:40] so this woman came up and then she told
[26:43] me you know what Pastor God has revealed
[26:46] to me that I should go deeper and
[26:49] deeper deeper and deeper but I want God
[26:53] has told me that you have to lead me go
[26:56] to that depth of Prayer
[26:59] lead me deeper in pray I said sister I
[27:02] don't I'm not the Holy Spirit to lead
[27:04] you deeper in
[27:07] prayer God has been telling me I should
[27:10] even leave work I should just maybe
[27:13] maybe stay at church or where do you
[27:16] live I don't know I think she had had an
[27:19] idea that I live near the
[27:21] church so she thought Oh Sister you are
[27:24] you are now an
[27:25] intercessor you should I will support
[27:27] you come
[27:30] I told sister I'm sorry the Bible
[27:32] doesn't tell us to do that even if you
[27:35] an
[27:35] intercessor you have to work and sustain
[27:40] yourself and support the work of
[27:42] God and then she left then came back
[27:46] again Pastor after that someone you
[27:48] preached I I need to go deeper in prayer
[27:52] oh Pastor just lead
[27:53] me you know God the holy spirit is
[27:56] telling me you have to pray with me
[27:58] it has to be you pray with me for
[28:01] some I said I I God the Holy Spirit
[28:05] spoke to you but he didn't speak to
[28:08] me because I already design the wrong
[28:10] Spirit
[28:11] there that's why you Believers have to
[28:14] have
[28:16] designment and then when she realized
[28:18] had when the wrong speed realized I had
[28:22] designed then you know one day she came
[28:24] up said pastor God has spoken to me
[28:28] that now you should um every service
[28:32] every Sunday service you should tell all
[28:34] the people at
[28:36] church they should come at your home and
[28:39] your wife should cook for them
[28:42] something and also they they eat
[28:45] something and this dog of yours lock it
[28:48] up somewhere this is what God is telling
[28:52] you I said well God does not tell you
[28:54] what to do in my
[28:57] home I told her sister that is not
[29:00] God I was very bold with that I had to
[29:03] rebuke
[29:04] her and the moment I did that said sir
[29:09] the next time she wrote sir she didn't
[29:11] even call me Pastor sir God has showed
[29:15] me you have a very wrong
[29:17] Spirit you need
[29:21] deliverance and the last I heard of
[29:24] her she she went to the
[29:27] Adventist
[29:28] I pray God deliv
[29:30] her but these are familiar
[29:34] spirits we to have
[29:37] designment we need gifts Among
[29:40] Us that's why those gifts should be
[29:44] tested you know when you have a gift and
[29:48] and see something about
[29:49] somebody don't walk right to them and
[29:52] tell no you are not their Pastor you're
[29:55] not their Shepherd follow the right
[29:57] Channel
[30:00] maybe I've been praying with this
[30:03] person and as as they pastor and I know
[30:05] they're going through some
[30:07] situation and then God shows you and
[30:10] then you go to
[30:11] them you you you've I told somebody
[30:14] where was
[30:17] the where was
[30:21] it on the
[30:24] breastplate of the
[30:26] priest
[30:28] what was
[30:29] the it was the only
[30:32] way of
[30:35] determining whether a message was from
[30:37] God or from the
[30:40] devil now when you who
[30:45] prophesy oh you who saw a
[30:48] vision and you speaking in the name of
[30:50] the
[30:51] Lord you don't just come to the
[30:53] people and then they say
[30:56] Amen
[30:59] that
[31:00] gift is
[31:02] carried before anybody says
[31:05] amen and they bring it to the high
[31:08] priest who was standing there with those
[31:12] stones and then they would tell him okay
[31:14] now you
[31:16] speak before
[31:20] the and after you speak you know I
[31:24] sawah to repent of this
[31:28] and then if the stones were
[31:31] Qui nobody would ask they would bring
[31:36] ston and kill you a natural
[31:42] death
[31:43] because wrong demon wrong Spirits used
[31:47] you but if it was the spirit of
[31:50] God those stores will begin to
[31:54] sh begin to shine every is gone
[31:58] and then they say amen God has spoken to
[32:02] and today where
[32:05] is the word of
[32:07] God the Old and New
[32:10] Testament and how do we test it the
[32:13] Bible says test every
[32:16] spirit and that's why if you have a gift
[32:19] or a message for to
[32:22] somebody you have to bring it to the
[32:25] pastor's
[32:26] office but don't just
[32:31] spread let it be tested with the
[32:34] word let it be tested
[32:37] fast lest you spread a wrong
[32:41] spirit in the congregation and you cause
[32:44] yourself to be
[32:47] damed praise the name of the Lord and
[32:51] that's why we have to have
[32:52] designment is very important and we see
[32:56] that the gift of of
[33:00] intercession tongu prophecies it is all
[33:04] necessary we need it in the church I
[33:07] said we need it in the
[33:08] church Tong and interpretation of T we
[33:12] need it in the church each of them have
[33:15] their
[33:17] place in the body to for the body to
[33:21] function we need it in the church but
[33:24] how can it come if we don't spend time
[33:27] in the presence
[33:30] and I look like I veed off a little
[33:34] bit know the Holy Spirit never makes
[33:37] mistakes praise the name of the Lord and
[33:40] so I was speaking of Jesus
[33:45] Christ with all that we have gone
[33:48] through and that's why when we go
[33:50] through
[33:51] things he comes to us and he says I know
[33:55] what you're going
[33:56] through I know what you're
[33:58] going Revelation 29 says I Know Thy
[34:03] works I know th
[34:05] tribulation I know your
[34:07] poverty one of you said you are you are
[34:10] poor I know
[34:12] your and he said but you are
[34:14] rich I know but you are
[34:19] rich but you are rich praise the name of
[34:22] the Lord so in other words it's just a
[34:25] state you are in now
[34:28] but as long as Jesus is in the
[34:32] Bo he says I know I know your
[34:36] tribulation I know your poverty I know
[34:39] your sickness I know your trials I know
[34:42] your Temptations I know your weaknesses
[34:45] I know your difficulties what is your
[34:48] problem what is your difficulties and it
[34:51] makes you not serve
[34:53] God in other words he says I know
[34:56] because I can
[35:02] I have been here
[35:03] before I know what you are going through
[35:06] remember I stepped into this boat before
[35:10] you Hallelujah I have been in this boat
[35:12] before
[35:13] you trust
[35:15] me God is telling you to trust
[35:18] me he has been in that situation
[35:21] before whatever situation you think you
[35:24] have been
[35:25] in he has been in it before
[35:28] if you think you poor Jesus was also
[35:32] poor at one time he told the man foxes
[35:37] have where they lay their
[35:39] heads and you know birs have where they
[35:41] they have
[35:42] their the son of man myself I don't even
[35:46] have a bed I don't even have a house so
[35:50] if you're poor Jesus has been there
[35:54] before and he can relate
[36:01] God there was a time when Jesus didn't
[36:04] even have a
[36:06] coin one coin like
[36:10] this I meant to say sister Grace
[36:15] Grace not one coin and then they came
[36:19] they want
[36:20] tax money for
[36:24] tax I don't
[36:26] have looked at
[36:29] Peter now he was not speaking this as
[36:35] Jesus the man he was speaking this
[36:43] as situations bring us to a place
[36:46] whereby we have to recognize the God in
[36:54] us Sometimes some of us have to come to
[36:58] place where you say enough is enough I
[37:01] am no longer going to agree with my
[37:04] situation I don't agree with my
[37:06] situation enough is enough and you begin
[37:10] to
[37:11] prophesy I don't know how many of you
[37:13] ever come to that
[37:14] place let me tell you when you come to
[37:16] that place not
[37:20] mechanically by faith and by the
[37:23] anointing of God upon your life when you
[37:25] come to that place whatever you prophesy
[37:29] over your life will always come to pass
[37:32] and Jesus turned to
[37:34] Peter and he said go and
[37:37] fish the very first
[37:39] fish open his mouth take out the money
[37:43] out that was not a man
[37:45] speaking that was God who knew all
[37:48] things The God Who created the
[37:51] fish The God Who made the fish The God
[37:55] Who made the sea the God who put that
[37:58] money
[37:59] there is The God Who told him go and do
[38:02] that now that same God is in
[38:05] us that same God is in
[38:08] the
[38:10] hallelujah amen he says your life is in
[38:12] my
[38:13] hands just follow me into this
[38:16] Bo I got this follow
[38:19] me and vers 24 he
[38:22] say there arose a violent storm on the
[38:26] sea so that the boat was being covered
[38:29] up by the
[38:34] waves but he was
[38:37] sleeping he was
[38:39] sleeping but there came a violent
[38:44] storm on the
[38:46] sea what happens in your
[38:49] life when there are violent things in
[38:51] your
[38:53] life and you do not know how to sail
[38:56] through
[38:58] I don't know if I'm preaching to
[39:00] someone you don't you don't know how to
[39:02] sail through
[39:04] it you go to your friend will you go to
[39:07] your brother will you go to your mother
[39:10] you know what here's what David
[39:12] said is he that has the god of Jacob for
[39:15] his
[39:21] help whose hope is in the Lord his
[39:25] God which made Heaven and Earth
[39:28] and the Sea so he says there was a
[39:33] tempest there was a violent
[39:35] storm but you see he says happy is the
[39:40] man whose help is the god of
[39:44] Ja I don't know about you but my help is
[39:47] the god of
[39:51] Ja my hope is in the
[39:53] Lord my hope is not in

[42:52] submission that place of
[42:54] humility Jus without him

[43:33] have they don't know what they
[43:36] want I'm telling we preach it here but
[43:40] they don't
[43:43] practice you you are
[43:45] educated you you've not searched for a
[43:48] job you've not started a company you've
[43:51] not done anything but you're
[43:54] praying now I'm preaching to you
[43:57] you need to
[43:59] exercise your
[44:02] Authority you need to come to a
[44:04] place whereby you speak by that
[44:11] Authority let me preach let me preach to
[44:13] you for a few more moments I come to a
[44:16] close the Bible says all things were
[44:18] made by
[44:20] him without him was not anything that
[44:24] was in him was life and the life was the
[44:28] light of
[44:29] men that is the Christ that walked down
[44:32] here on the streets of
[44:34] Jerusalem this Earth the Bible says he
[44:37] was in the world and the world was made
[44:39] by him and the world knew him not if the
[44:43] disciples only understood who was
[44:45] sleeping in
[44:51] that
[44:53] Jehovah the creator of the
[44:56] universe he was in the world and the
[44:59] world was made by him and the world knew
[45:05] him why do you think they
[45:08] cried when the violent storm came they
[45:12] did not know who was in the boat with
[45:16] them if you know who is in the boat with
[45:19] you you will not cry when the stor
[45:23] come because you know who is in the B
[45:28] the one who made the se he the one who
[45:31] made the things that are in the
[45:34] se he made the Heaven and the Earth the
[45:37] Bible says all things were made by him
[45:42] oh praise God in him was
[45:45] life in him was life so you can't even
[45:48] fear
[45:50] death because you know life is here he
[45:53] was in the world and the Word was made
[45:56] by him and he came down he condescended
[46:01] down into a level of a human
[46:04] being and he came and slept in
[46:08] the Jehovah
[46:14] sleeping would you believe it if I told
[46:16] you that that
[46:21] Jehovah you
[46:23] wouldn't because you're also not
[46:25] believing this one that you are seeing
[46:29] because you're not believeing the one
[46:30] you're seeing
[46:34] now don't look at me look at
[46:38] yourself that's the one I'm talking
[46:42] about what do you think the Bible
[46:44] says he that is in US is greater than he
[46:48] that
[46:49] is who is that
[46:51] one
[46:53] God who is heh God can I tell you this
[46:58] friend Jesus that Jehovah is in the
[47:02] bo Hallelujah and if we can realize it
[47:07] nothing is
[47:09] impossible if we can realize it nothing
[47:12] is impossible amen is the creator of
[47:15] Heaven and Earth he's the creator of all
[47:18] the riches of the world all the gold and
[47:22] all the
[47:23] silver and the Sea the sea become
[47:28] violent but just
[47:30] laugh when the SE becomes violent just
[47:34] laugh why because the creator of the sea
[47:39] is Right In
[47:41] You Hallelujah but they did not know
[47:45] that's why they cry for you and me when
[47:49] you have problems
[47:50] brother to laugh and pray laugh and pray
[47:57] GL to
[47:59] God laugh and
[48:01] pray tell your neighbor laugh
[48:04] anday because those problems don't know
[48:07] who they dealing with they're not
[48:10] dealing with you they're dealing with
[48:12] jeh
[48:14] God hallelujah amen he was in the world
[48:18] and the world was made by him and the
[48:21] world knew him
[48:22] not but I said today we have known him
[48:27] we have known him in the power of his
[48:32] resurrection Hallelujah hallu Jehovah
[48:36] God
[48:37] himself my
[48:40] God praise God he never cease to be
[48:45] God when your problems come he does not
[48:48] cease to be
[48:51] God some people feel like I don't feel
[48:54] like a Believer now
[48:57] how can I be a beli and be this
[49:01] sick because he
[49:03] slept he did not become less of
[49:09] God by the way let me
[49:12] ask was he sleeping or he was faking
[49:16] it let's think about it let's think
[49:19] about it let's be
[49:21] hon was he sleeping or he was
[49:25] faking
[49:31] [Laughter]
[49:34] now this is the
[49:36] Paradox for him to be truly
[49:40] human he was truly
[49:45] sleeping but God the tells me he never
[49:50] [Music]
[49:52] sleeps so God was wide
[49:55] awake while was
[49:57] sleeping God was
[49:59] awake the same God who was in
[50:02] here he was looking at the
[50:04] storm and
[50:07] laughing but Jesus was
[50:09] sleeping so the
[50:11] disciples did not seek The God Who was
[50:15] looking at
[50:18] them that's the same same
[50:21] God that was with them right back in the
[50:24] days of the Red Sea
[50:28] the same God who went behind
[50:31] them and the Bible says through the
[50:33] pillar of
[50:35] fire he looked at the
[50:38] Egyptians and he opened his eyes and he
[50:41] looked at them and by just looking at
[50:45] them their Childs began to
[50:48] Break by looking at them you know the
[50:52] sea dealt so bad with
[50:55] them by looking at them oh praise God
[51:00] that is the same same God the same
[51:03] Jehovah
[51:04] God the Old Testament who was right
[51:08] there in the boat sleeping but he was
[51:12] not
[51:13] sleeping he was right there looking at
[51:17] them looking at the storm looking at
[51:21] them and he saw that they did not have
[51:25] faith he didn't see that I didn't have
[51:28] faith after he woke
[51:32] up he was
[51:33] [Music]
[51:44] sleeping what's
[51:48] happening what is
[51:50] happening the
[51:52] storm so what have you done we don't
[51:55] know we crying hey you don't have faith
[51:59] it wasn't like
[52:01] that it wasn't like
[52:04] that when he was
[52:06] sleeping that was a human
[52:09] being but the the time when he was
[52:13] sleeping God was
[52:15] awake Our God does not
[52:17] sleep your God does not sleep when you
[52:21] are in your trouble he does not sleep
[52:23] when you are sick he doesn't sleep when
[52:25] you in trouble he doesn't
[52:27] when you poor he doesn't sleep when you
[52:29] have no rent he doesn't sleep when you
[52:32] are filled with problem he doesn't sleep
[52:34] he's awake all the
[52:36] time when you being tempted he does not
[52:40] sleep he does not
[52:43] Slumber that God was right there at that
[52:47] moment oh when you have no job and you
[52:49] want a
[52:50] job he doesn't sleep when when you have
[52:54] no tution he doesn't sleep
[52:58] sister phbe don't you think he was right
[53:00] there when you were defending your your
[53:04] paper and you thought you were the one
[53:06] Defending
[53:08] Your no he was right there
[53:12] looking when bad happens and when good
[53:17] happens he does not
[53:19] sleep why God is
[53:23] God and he looked at them while sleeping
[53:28] but also awake and he saw these people
[53:32] why do you think he said they had little
[53:35] fa because they did not believe who was
[53:40] in
[53:42] Hallelujah in other words if they had
[53:47] re what is faith
[53:51] brother what is faith God bless
[53:55] you
[53:57] God bless you faith is a
[54:01] revelation so it was not revealed to
[54:05] them who was actually
[54:08] there and that's why Jesus said you over
[54:12] of little
[54:15] ration why little because they had that
[54:18] little
[54:19] Revelation was their
[54:23] Lord but their Revelation did not pass
[54:28] they thought he was just a good
[54:30] Prophet but they did not recognize he
[54:33] was
[54:36] Jehovah and they said you have little
[54:39] faith and way all that
[54:42] happened the storm came up and
[54:45] everything took
[54:47] place the Bible says and they went and
[54:49] awakened
[54:50] him saying Lord rescue and preserve us
[54:54] we are perishing and you know that I I
[54:57] love I love some scriptures
[55:00] here this is the faith they didn't
[55:04] have and let me give it to you psalms 27
[55:08] some trust in
[55:10] chariots some in
[55:12] horses but we remember the name of the
[55:17] Lord in
[55:19] Colossians colians 3:17 says whatever
[55:22] you do in word or
[55:24] deed All In the name of the Lord
[55:28] Jesus giving thanks to the father by
[55:32] him whatever you do in
[55:35] what all in
[55:38] what in the
[55:40] name Philippians
[55:43] 210 that at the name of
[55:46] Jesus every knee should
[55:50] bow of things in
[55:52] heaven and things in
[55:55] Earth things
[55:56] the and that every
[56:00] time confess that Jesus Christ is
[56:06] Lord praise the name of the Lord oh
[56:09] that's what they should have
[56:13] received we should use that name
[56:16] also the little Revelation they
[56:18] had because they knew the
[56:21] name that's all they knew but they did
[56:24] not know who was the the name
[56:27] oh listen to me today we have received
[56:30] the full
[56:31] revelation of who Jesus is those people
[56:34] knew
[56:36] Jesus but they did not know he was the
[56:39] lord of the Old
[56:41] Testament they did not know he was the
[56:43] Jehovah of the they did not know that
[56:46] but we today know that Jesus is
[56:51] Lord but the little Revelation they had
[56:54] they called on him
[56:56] they trusted him they called on him but
[57:00] the Christians of today we do not call
[57:03] on Jesus when we have problems the
[57:07] moment you have
[57:08] problems you sit

[1:02:28] to
[1:02:31] believe you are sick and you are calling
[1:02:34] me when you're already in the
[1:02:36] hospital that's why I will also take
[1:02:38] very long to
[1:02:39] come because after all why are you
[1:02:42] calling me

[1:03:01] spirit and children get

[1:03:06] hospital she says Dear please lay your
[1:03:08] hand on my children as man of God I
[1:03:12] don't go as her husband or as the father
[1:03:14] of the
[1:03:14] children she has fulfilled the
[1:03:17] scripture I will go and lay my hand on
[1:03:19] the
[1:03:20] children or sometimes even on
[1:03:23] her when she's sick let me tell you that
[1:03:26] prayer always works always
[1:03:29] works the Bible did not say Pastor have
[1:03:32] you seen anyone in the
[1:03:35] church them
[1:03:37] and even if I find you sick and you
[1:03:41] don't ask for pray I will
[1:03:46] never we have to do what the Bible
[1:03:50] says that's the order of the
[1:03:53] word you are rushing to the hospital
[1:03:55] before you even
[1:03:59] called God has his Representatives on
[1:04:01] Earth and those are the
[1:04:04] ministers and that's why Jesus slept and
[1:04:07] he remained
[1:04:10] sleeping until the disciples remember
[1:04:13] [Music]
[1:04:15] him by the way Jesus is in
[1:04:18] Theus is in the he said yes let's be in

[1:05:07] God Jesus is in the
[1:05:11] bo I can on this one for months tell
[1:05:16] is I believe in the of my
[1:05:21] life Hallelujah the prophet
[1:05:24] says
[1:05:27] here sets a
[1:05:32] lady with a red was
[1:05:36] on now this is during a prayer
[1:05:41] meeting and I love it when people
[1:05:46] believe the angel of the
[1:05:48] Lord would begin to
[1:05:51] move in the form of pill of
[1:05:54] Fire would go and rest on
[1:05:58] something and then the prophet would
[1:06:01] begin to see
[1:06:04] that and then you would see everything
[1:06:06] about
[1:06:07] that but it began by the person
[1:06:14] faith and then here one of them is
[1:06:17] speaking to
[1:06:20] this a lady sitting here with a red
[1:06:24] w look this way sister seem like you are
[1:06:28] in
[1:06:29] trouble your husband is sitting there
[1:06:31] holding
[1:06:33] you your loved one look here you are
[1:06:38] suffering you've had some trouble
[1:06:41] recently Haven
[1:06:43] you you've been to a
[1:06:46] clinic
[1:06:48] Hospital yes you've had an
[1:06:52] operation listen to detail deta
[1:06:59] this cannot be a
[1:07:00] man this was
[1:07:02] God speaking through the
[1:07:06] Mind haven't you it was May Brothers May
[1:07:12] CL is that that right I can see the
[1:07:17] institution it's happening between you
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:21] die it's a GBL
[1:07:24] operation
[1:07:26] God went through because
[1:07:32] that it took the
[1:07:34] prophet who was on the pulpit and took
[1:07:38] him to an
[1:07:41] operation he showed him it is
[1:07:46] May and then he went down to the
[1:07:50] operation and then he took him to the
[1:07:52] operation
[1:07:54] table
[1:07:55] and inside the
[1:07:58] body and he said yes it's a
[1:08:05] operation is is that right and he said
[1:08:08] if I am not
[1:08:10] mistaken because he was just
[1:08:13] seeing and saying what he's
[1:08:16] seeing this is a man who went to
[1:08:18] education up
[1:08:22] to7 so some of these things he learned
[1:08:24] while he was at
[1:08:28] how did he even
[1:08:34] know so you are seeing a
[1:08:36] vision but is telling the exact part
[1:08:38] which they
[1:08:40] operating and he saying it
[1:08:45] is and he says you are worrying about it
[1:08:49] the Holy Spirit takes him from
[1:08:51] there and he brings him back to
[1:08:54] the and he tells him about the
[1:08:58] woman about what is happening now in her
[1:09:03] spirit you are
[1:09:06] worried
[1:09:09] because he even tell him the reason
[1:09:15] why you see this is not a
[1:09:18] man I can look at you
[1:09:20] brother and if I talk to you for a
[1:09:23] minute I can discern
[1:09:26] whether you are worried or not but I may
[1:09:29] not know
[1:09:30] why okay so this is beyond what this is
[1:09:34] beyond the designment of
[1:09:37] spirit this is designment of the
[1:09:40] heart it has happened three times
[1:09:43] only in the days of s
[1:09:47] Abraham in the days of Jesus and then in
[1:09:50] the days of
[1:09:51] William designment of the
[1:09:53] heart that is
[1:09:55] M
[1:09:57] sign it declares that the Messiah is
[1:10:00] here it declares that Jesus is in
[1:10:05] the and he
[1:10:07] says you are worried about
[1:10:10] it about the
[1:10:12] operation because you are
[1:10:14] weak and now he says he gives a
[1:10:18] prophetic declaration
[1:10:21] rather that's why don't always despise
[1:10:24] the Bible says despise not
[1:10:28] proph and he says to her stand on your
[1:10:32] feet and the woman stands and he says
[1:10:35] Jesus Christ makes
[1:10:38] you
[1:10:41] now and he says to her you are
[1:10:45] healed don't have no fear and then he
[1:10:48] turns to the people and he says
[1:10:51] everybody
[1:10:53] believe have faith in God
[1:10:56] believe with all your heart be sure he
[1:10:58] knows all
[1:11:00] things do you believe it he knows all
[1:11:04] things Jesus is in the boat that same
[1:11:08] thing can happen right here right
[1:11:11] now and that's what happens every
[1:11:14] service God designs your life every
[1:11:17] service tell is happening in your life
[1:11:20] every
[1:11:21] service and when he designs your life
[1:11:23] then believe it you shall receive what
[1:11:25] you
[1:11:28] want and in
[1:11:31] Bas he says now Jesus that man
[1:11:35] there with that prostate trouble I I am
[1:11:40] with that prostate
[1:11:45] trouble says forget
[1:11:48] it
