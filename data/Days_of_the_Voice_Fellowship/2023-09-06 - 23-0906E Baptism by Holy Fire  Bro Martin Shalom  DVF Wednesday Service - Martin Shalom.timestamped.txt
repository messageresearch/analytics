[45:54] 13.
[46:02] we can start from 12.
[46:04] it says that then came also a Publican
[46:07] to be baptized and said unto him Master
[46:11] what shall we do
[46:14] and he said unto them except
[46:18] he said unto them exact no more than
[46:21] that which is appointed
[46:24] you which is pointed you
[46:26] and the soldiers like was demanded of
[46:29] him saying and what shall we do and say
[46:33] it unto them
[46:34] do violence to no man neither cause any
[46:40] falsely and be content beages
[46:44] it as the people we are in ex
[46:47] as the people were in expectation and
[46:51] all men mused in their heart of John
[46:55] whether he were the Christ or not
[46:59] John answered saying unto them
[47:02] all I I indeed baptize you with water
[47:06] but one mightier than I come
[47:10] the legend of whom shoes are not worthy
[47:15] to unloose he shall baptize you with a
[47:18] Holy Ghost
[47:19] and with fire
[47:21] Luca is
[47:42] foreign
[47:53] [Music]
[47:55] foreign
[48:02] [Music]
[48:17] [Music]
[48:23] [Music]
[48:33] [Music]
[48:40] but the shaft it will ban with fire
[48:44] unquenchable
[48:46] foreign
[48:49] [Music]
[49:22] yeah amen Amina blessed with the name of
[49:25] the Lord
[49:26] how come you all in the name of Jesus
[49:32] and this evening just pray for me
[49:36] that the Lord will give me the utterance
[49:41] amen Amina yeah you're not standing here
[49:44] has never been easy
[49:48] but we trust the Lord that he will speak
[49:51] to us
[49:54] I'm going to have something small to
[49:57] share about baptism
[50:00] by holy fires
[50:10] blessed with the name of the Lord
[50:13] hear where we have read
[50:16] we are seeing uh
[50:19] in the Book of Luke
[50:23] 16 he says that John answered saying
[50:26] unto them I indeed baptize you with the
[50:29] water but one mightier than I come the
[50:33] largest of whose shoes I'm not worthy to
[50:37] unloose he shall baptize you with a Holy
[50:40] Ghost and with the fire you can
[51:03] do you believe that even today God still
[51:05] baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[51:11] amen because Hebrews 13 8 says
[51:15] that Jesus Christ yes it's the same
[51:18] yesterday
[51:20] the same today
[51:22] and forever
[51:24] and we believe that a hundred percent
[51:28] because words
[51:30] in this last generation
[51:33] there are three things which God did
[51:37] in time passed
[51:54] but when I go
[51:56] and again and the Holy Ghost comes he
[52:00] will bring these things through your
[52:01] members
[52:03] he was putting emphasis on the Holy
[52:06] Spirit
[52:08] and here when John was baptizing
[52:12] John remember all of us so that he was
[52:15] preparing the way
[52:18] some thought that John was the Messiah
[52:23] but John told them that I am not the
[52:26] Messiah
[52:27] but I'm the voice of the one crying
[52:39] the prophet was the Messiah
[52:44] but he was not the message
[52:47] but he was preparing the way
[52:53] blessed with the name of the Lord
[52:55] and here John tells them that when Jesus
[53:00] comes yes he will baptize you with the
[53:03] fire
[53:04] Holy Ghost and Fire
[53:08] blessed be the name of the Lord and even
[53:11] today
[53:12] Jesus is baptizing Believers yes
[53:16] with the Holy Ghost and Fire no more
[53:20] and without the box of the Holy Ghost
[53:24] without being filled with the Holy
[53:26] Spirit
[53:27] there is
[53:30] [Music]
[53:35] to put emphasis on that is
[53:40] blessed be the name of the Lord
[53:42] amen that we must
[53:46] be baptized with the Holy Fire because
[53:51] you must be baptized with that Holy Fire
[53:56] that is the reason we come to church
[54:00] that's the reason why we pray yes
[54:06] God is not taking up just a good church
[54:11] but Rapture is for those who have
[54:14] experience with God
[54:18] being judgment is not enough
[54:22] being a good singer is not enough
[54:25] and it will take you nowhere
[54:29] coming to church will take us nowhere
[54:33] attending every service will not take us
[54:36] anywhere
[54:39] but our progress as a church
[54:43] in the Bible of the Holy Spirit
[54:47] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[54:53] Hallelujah
[54:55] says in the message who is this
[55:01] [Music]
[55:04] 650221
[55:07] it was preached on Sunday 1965.
[55:12] but he tell all the world out of you
[55:17] ideas
[55:21] [Applause]
[55:28] of the Holy Ghost
[55:33] amen I mean the importance of the Holy
[55:36] Ghost
[55:37] the reason why we need him
[55:41] when the Holy Spirit comes in US
[55:49] bless him in the name of the Lord he
[55:52] will remember the world out of you and
[55:54] me
[55:59] praise the Lord and because John knew
[56:02] this
[56:03] John knew that his baptism was not
[56:05] announced
[56:07] and remember in Acts 19.
[56:12] the Bible says
[56:15] when uh when Paul was at country
[56:21] when was passing of the uppermost we can
[56:24] read there let us just read there
[56:28] Acts chapter 19.
[56:41] and he came to pass that while apples
[56:44] was at current Paul having passed
[56:47] through the upper Coast came to emphasis
[56:49] and finding certain disciples he said
[56:52] unto them have you received the Holy
[56:54] Ghost since you believed and he said
[56:58] unto him we have not as such as had
[57:03] whether there be any Holy Ghost
[57:07] foreign
[57:26] [Music]
[57:32] amen Amina if the same question comes
[57:38] and Jesus is asking the same question
[57:40] tonight
[57:42] have you received the Holy Ghost since
[57:45] you believe
[57:50] that is the biggest question
[57:54] amen the sign that you believe
[57:59] the proof that we believe
[58:03] is the holy spirit
[58:07] amen because without the Holy Spirit
[58:10] we have no Journey we are not even

[58:16] worship no questions
[58:19] blessed with the name of the Lord
[58:25] these brothers
[58:29] did you see the Holy Ghost since you
[58:32] believe
[58:35] it's unfortunate that they are never
[58:37] very hard about it

[59:03] [Applause]
[59:44] they and they say it unto him we have
[59:47] not so much hard whether there be any
[59:51] Holy Ghost
[59:53] the way up saying we have known even
[59:56] ever had on the past things amen amen
[59:59] then Saint Paul John very baptized with

[1:00:05] them that they should believe on him we
[1:00:09] shall come after him
[1:00:11] that is on Christ
[1:00:21] Apostle Paul is referring this disciples
[1:00:29] because John himself says
[1:00:32] I am not the one I baptize with water
[1:00:38] amen
[1:00:39] who is coming after me
[1:00:43] it's the one who baptized with the fire
[1:00:47] or the Holy Ghost
[1:00:50] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:00:57] the only thing that can cleanse this
[1:00:59] stuff

[1:02:25] inside outside the world
[1:02:29] even in the church
[1:02:33] and the world can suppress that pressure
[1:02:36] is the Holy Ghost
[1:02:37] [Music]
[1:02:39] because the Holy Spirit looks at the
[1:02:42] promise of God
[1:02:46] will never believe in the promises
[1:02:52] there is nothing to believe the word of
[1:02:55] God

[1:04:29] what we need today it is the Holy Spirit
[1:04:33] the hospital working in our lives

[1:04:52] amen
[1:04:53] of God in the city with our spirit
[1:05:01] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:05:04] amen the portion of Jesus Christ in US
[1:05:09] which Jesus is going to take
[1:05:13] what's going to lift us off this Earth
[1:05:22] it's not how much investment we have
[1:05:25] saving to be Mercury father Spirit of
[1:05:28] Christ
[1:05:31] between Daniel and the rest of the
[1:05:34] Israel
[1:05:39] he has something special in his soul
[1:05:43] that is what kept reminding him about
[1:05:46] that promise
[1:05:50] me to God
[1:05:52] Amen Amina Daniel knew because the Bible
[1:05:57] tells us
[1:05:59] he said according the number of books
[1:06:04] according to the prophets of Prophet
[1:06:06] Jeremiah
[1:06:08] Daniel knew that time was getting close
[1:06:14] the Bible tells us that Daniel set his
[1:06:18] heart to seek after God
[1:06:23] what made Daniel to do that
[1:06:26] but it was the spirit of God in him
[1:06:30] because the spirit of Christ
[1:06:34] seeketh after righteousness
[1:06:48] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:06:50] I mean if there ever was a time when the
[1:06:55] disciple picked up the burps of the Holy
[1:07:00] ghosts
[1:07:04] one of the mightiest weapons that's ever
[1:07:07] been given to them to the hand of men
[1:07:21] and I defeated the devil
[1:07:25] praise be to God the prophet saying that
[1:07:29] that purpose of the Holy Ghost
[1:07:32] is one of the mightiest weapons ever
[1:07:35] been given to a church to the hand of
[1:07:38] men
