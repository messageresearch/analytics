[38:48] before.
[38:50] How many remember when he preached?

[47:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[47:42] &gt;&gt; The Lord is good.
[47:46] &gt;&gt; And uh we thank God for this uh
[47:48] opportunity that God has given us to
[47:50] come to
[47:54] Uh
[47:56] yeah, it's not the first time I'm
[47:58] standing behind.
[48:01] I've stood here like two or three times.
[48:04] Yeah. Well, it's been a while since
[48:09] I want to appreciate pastor for giving
[48:11] me this opportunity
[48:14] to come and testify.
[48:17] I usually say this.
[48:21] I don't consider myself a preacher.
[48:25] I just testify
[48:28] what the Lord has put in my heart.
[48:30] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[48:32] So if you came expecting a mighty man of
[48:35] God,
[48:38] well, you might be disappointed
[48:41] because I'm just going to speak
[48:42] something very simple,
[48:45] a testimony.
[48:47] Praise the Lord. Do you love the Lord?
[48:51] Yeah, I'm going to uh read from the book
[48:54] of Psalms.
[48:57] &gt;&gt; Well, I'm here with my wife.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; She's over there. You can welcome her.
[49:11] I'm called brother Edson.
[49:15] I come from Teso
[49:17] and I stay in.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:22] &gt;&gt; If you are seeing me for the first time,
[49:25] then you are the vista in DVF.
[49:29] Praise the Lord. Because this is the
[49:32] first church I attended.
[49:35] The very first time I came to camp.
[49:39] Praise the Lord.
[49:41] Well, I've been away for a while,
[49:44] &gt;&gt; but I've come back home.
[49:47] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[49:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Psalms chapter 42,
[49:54] &gt;&gt; versh.
[50:00] Well, I don't know how long I'm going to
[50:01] preach.
[50:06] I don't know what uh what time is always
[50:08] given on Wednesday.
[50:10] Okay, God bless you.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:13] &gt;&gt; Shall we read in the name of the Lord
[50:15] Jesus?
[50:17] &gt;&gt; As the heart pants after the
[50:19] waterbrooks, so pants my soul after you,
[50:22] oh God. My soul thirsts for God, for the
[50:26] living God. When shall I come and appear
[50:28] before God?
[50:34] Precious
[50:51] father, we have read your word.
[50:54] The same word tells us that letter kills
[50:56] but the spirit gives.
[51:00] It's our prayer that may you come and
[51:01] inspire this
[51:04] also inspire me. Oh God
[51:07] that Lord let the spirit speak.
[51:10] If there is anything that I've prepared,
[51:14] put it aside,
[51:16] may you come and speak to me
[51:18] because you know their desires.
[51:21] I do not know but Lord I know you know.
[51:26] Speak to somebody who desires.
[51:28] Blessed be your majesty. Grant it father
[51:33] to the glory of your name in Jesus
[51:35] mighty and precious.
[51:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. You may be seated in the presence
[51:39] of the Lord.
[51:46] I'm going to speak uh
[51:52] on hungering and thirsting for God.
[51:56] It might have ever been preached. It
[51:59] might have been preached here before.
[52:02] I do not know. But with God, things are
[52:05] always new.
[52:08] I believe it's not the first time you're
[52:09] hearing that scripture.
[52:12] It might have been read several days.
[52:15] But always God has a new thought.
[52:19] Praise the Lord.
[52:22] God wants you to thirst for him.
[52:27] It is God's desire that we thirst.
[52:32] And as a believer,
[52:36] you should thraise
[52:39] the Lord. You should have a desire
[52:43] deep down your soul. Something that is
[52:45] desiring for God,
[52:48] something that pushes you to know more
[52:49] of God,
[52:52] that should push you to Christ.
[52:55] That thirst is there.
[52:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; And we should try to fulfill it in the
[53:01] way that God has purposed it.
[53:05] Now this scripture says
[53:07] that as the heart pants after the water,
[53:10] so my soul pants after you
[53:15] says here in the message thirst.
[53:19] He says God wants you to thirst for him.
[53:24] Hallelujah.
[53:26] &gt;&gt; As they had punted for the waterbrook,
[53:28] so my soul thirst after thee of God.
[53:32] Now if the deer was pinging for the
[53:34] waterbrook,
[53:37] what if some somebody came along?
[53:41] Another bad deer could come along
[53:44] and say, I tell you what,
[53:48] I know where there is a mud hole down
[53:50] there.
[53:52] Well,
[53:53] &gt;&gt; the deer wouldn't want that.
[53:57] &gt;&gt; He wouldn't want He wouldn't It wouldn't
[53:59] do him any good.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; It wouldn't do him any good.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; This deer
[54:06] is thirsting for water,
[54:09] not for the M,
[54:11] but it's it's thirsting for the water.
[54:15] Somebody came along and wanted to
[54:18] introduce something new to him.
[54:21] Well, that would not be able to quench a
[54:22] thirst.
[54:24] Brother says it would not do him any
[54:26] good.
[54:28] You are thirsting after God. There's a
[54:31] thirst inside of you, something that is
[54:34] thirsting for God, something that is
[54:36] desiring for God. God has put that IN
[54:40] EVERYONE.
[54:42] ALL OF you here, you've got a thirst.
[54:45] And that thirst, you are supposed to
[54:47] thirst after God. But when what the
[54:50] devil does is to come and pervert the
[54:52] thirst.
[54:54] Hallelujah. HE COMES TO PERVERT IT,
[54:58] TRYING TO make you fulfill,
[55:00] trying to MAKE YOU QUENCH THE THIRST
[55:03] AFTER God with the things of the world.
[55:07] Praise the Lord. That is why you find
[55:09] people drinking themselves
[55:11] They are trying to fulfill. They are
[55:14] trying to LOOK FOR SOMETHING THAT WILL
[55:16] QUENCH THAT RIGHT thing that God has put
[55:19] in them.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[55:24] &gt;&gt; You find people. Men are not satisfied
[55:28] WITH ONE WIFE. WHY? THERE IS SOMETHING
[55:31] LACKING. THEY ARE THIRSTING.
[55:34] BUT I THINK BY marrying many, THEY WILL
[55:37] QUENCH THAT BLESSED THIRST THAT GOD HAS
[55:39] PUT IN THEM. WELL, when you do that, you
[55:42] only MAKE MATTERS WORSE.
[55:44] God puts that thirst in you so that you
[55:48] draw close to him BECAUSE IT'S ONLY GOD
[55:51] WHO HAS GOT A SUBSTANCE THAT CAN QUENCH
[55:54] THAT THIRST.
[55:56] HALLELUJAH. GOD HAS GOT SOMETHING THAT
[56:00] YOU DESIRE THAT WILL GIVE YOU PEACE. You
[56:03] do not have peace. GOD HAS PURPOSED IT
[56:06] THAT YOU DON'T HAVE peace so that you
[56:08] can find PEACE IN HIM
[56:11] BECAUSE he's the fountain of peace.
[56:14] People try
[56:16] to look for something that they think
[56:20] intellectually that is a SOLUTION TO THE
[56:23] PAST THAT GOD has put in. AND THE DEVIL
[56:26] DOES THAT. PRAISE THE LORD. SATAN CANNOT
[56:30] CREATE A
[56:32] BUT HE PERVERTS THE RIGHTEOUS THING THAT
[56:34] God has chosed
[56:38] be the name of the Lord Jesus. Satan
[56:41] poverts
[56:42] he does not have the power to CREATE
[56:45] BUT HE COMES WITH HIS EVIL POWER TO
[56:49] PERVERT THE right thing that GOD HAS
[56:50] CREATED. BLESSED BE THE name of the Lord
[56:53] Jesus. That's why people are meandering
[56:56] IN THE WORLD. WHAT ARE THEY looking for?
[57:00] THEY ARE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO TRY TO
[57:02] QUENCH
[57:04] THE BLESSED THIRST THAT GOD HAS PUT.
[57:07] WELL, I tell you church, today that
[57:09] thirst should drive you to Christ
[57:12] that God has PUT IN YOU, A program
[57:17] that God HAS ESTABLISHED IN YOU THAT YOU
[57:20] MAY RUN BACK TO HIM.
[57:23] YOU are not supposed to RUN AWAY FROM
[57:25] HIM. THAT FIRST HAS BEEN PUT THERE. RUN
[57:29] BACK TO GOD.
[57:30] HE'S GOT THE REMEDY. He's got the
[57:33] solution.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[57:37] We've got to thirst after God,
[57:40] not after the things of the world.
[57:43] Hallelujah. If you thirst for God, don't
[57:46] shake hands with a preacher
[57:48] and put your name on the book. If you
[57:51] are thirsting for God, THERE IS ONLY ONE
[57:53] THING TO SATISFY IT. TO MEET GOD.
[57:57] PRAISE THE LORD. IF YOU ARE THIRSTING
[57:59] FOR GOD TONIGHT, MARRYING ANOTHER WIFE
[58:02] cannot satisfy it. Marrying a second
[58:04] wife cannot satisfy. Drinking alcohol
[58:07] cannot help you. Praise the Lord.
[58:09] Running to another church cannot help
[58:11] you. Meeting a preacher cannot help you.
[58:15] Hallelujah.
[58:16] THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SATISFY THE ONLY
[58:20] THING THAT CAN QUENCH THE THIRST IS
[58:23] COMING IN CONTACT WITH GOD.
[58:28] Praise the Lord. If you have a feeling
[58:31] in your heart, there is SOMETHING
[58:33] LACKING IN YOUR LIFE. THERE IS something
[58:35] lacking. IF YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART,
[58:38] THERE IS SOMETHING THAT IS LACKING IN
[58:39] YOU. WELL, I TELL YOU TODAY, THERE'S
[58:42] ONLY ONE THING to do. IF YOU WANT TO
[58:44] FIND PEACE, IF YOU WANT TO FIND A TEST,
[58:47] RUN TO THE
[58:49] Christ
[58:51] because he has got a solution.
[58:53] Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[58:56] You are thirsting for God.
[58:58] The only way you can meet him is to do
[59:00] that.
[59:02] The only way you can quench that thirst
[59:05] is to meet God. That's when you'll find
[59:08] peace. THAT'S WHEN YOU'LL FIND REMEDY.
[59:11] THAT'S WHEN YOU FIND A SOLUTION. WHEN
[59:14] YOU MEET CHRIST, YOU WILL NEVER BE THE
[59:16] SAME AGAIN. WHEN YOU MEET GOD, YOU WILL
[59:20] NEVER THIRST AGAIN BECAUSE CHRIST IS THE
[59:23] SATISFACTION OF YOUR SOUL. HE'S
[59:25] EVERYTHING YOU GOT. HE'S ALL THAT YOU
[59:28] NEED. Praise the Lord. Stop running
[59:31] around, brother. Stop running around,
[59:34] sister. You need to meet Christ. You
[59:37] need to meet God. Your thirst may be
[59:41] quenched. There was a man in the Bible
[59:45] in the names of Job.
[59:49] Well, sometimes
[59:51] God gives us a trial
[59:54] that so that we will know.
[59:57] He is the only one who can solve our
[1:00:00] problem.
[1:00:02] Job chapter 23
[1:00:04] from verses one.
[1:00:06] Hallelujah. Do you love the Lord? Give
[1:00:09] the Lord a mighty hand of praise.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Job chapter 23
[1:00:16] from verses one. Are we there church?
[1:00:20] Then Job answered and said, "Even today
[1:00:24] is my complaint bitter. My stroke is
[1:00:26] heavier than my groaning." Great.
[1:00:36] We know that Job was in a trial
[1:00:39] and he went through difficult time
[1:00:42] that I believe none of us here has got
[1:00:45] blessed be the name of the Lord. He said
[1:00:48] my complaint
[1:00:50] trouble HOW I FEEL THE PAIN THAT I'M
[1:00:53] GOING THROUGH IS GREATER THAN THE WAY
[1:00:55] YOU ARE seeing me growing.
[1:00:57] HALLELUJAH. HE SAYS, "ALL THAT I KNEW
[1:01:01] WHERE I MIGHT FIND HIM. IF ONLY I KNEW
[1:01:05] WHERE I MIGHT FIND GOD. IF I COULD
[1:01:08] DISCOVER WHERE HE'S HIDING, IF I KNEW
[1:01:12] WHERE I COULD FIND HIM, HALLELUJAH, I
[1:01:15] MIGHT COME EVEN TO HIS SEAT." Is that
[1:01:19] your desire tonight? If
[1:01:24] Hebrews says, "Come to the THRONE OF
[1:01:26] GRACE. COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE THAT
[1:01:28] YOU MAY OBTAIN WHAT? MERCY. THAT YOU MAY
[1:01:32] OBTAIN MERCY. DO YOU DESIRE MERCY
[1:01:34] TONIGHT? COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE. IF
[1:01:37] YOU ARE DESIRING MERCY, IF YOU FEEL THAT
[1:01:40] YOU'RE DRAWN AWAY FROM GOD, WHEN THERE'S
[1:01:42] AN INVITATION TODAY, COME TO THE THRONE
[1:01:45] OF GRACE THAT YOU MAY OBTAIN MERCY. HOW
[1:01:49] MANY NEED MERCY TODAY? HERE I TELL YOU,
[1:01:51] CHURCH IS MERCY. THE BIBLE TELLS US HIS
[1:01:55] MERCIES HIS MERCIES ARE NEW TO US EVERY
[1:01:59] MORNING. GOD
[1:02:02] HAS GOT NEW MERCIES
[1:02:04] FOR YOU EVERY DAY. IT DOESN'T MATTER
[1:02:07] WHAT YOU DID YESTERDAY. HE HAS GOT A NEW
[1:02:09] MERCY. HE HAS GOT A NEW MERCY FOR YOU
[1:02:14] FOR EVERY DAY.
[1:02:16] Come to the throne of grace that you may
[1:02:19] obtain mercy. Not only mercy,
[1:02:23] you know what? But also grace. THE
[1:02:27] GRACE. THE GRACE TO help
[1:02:32] in time of needs.
[1:02:35] It is only grace that can help you in
[1:02:39] your TIME OF NEED. WHERE DO WE FIND
[1:02:41] GRACE? COME TO THE THRONE OF GRACE. IF
[1:02:44] YOU DESIRE GRACE, COME TO THE THRONE OF
[1:02:47] grace
[1:02:48] that you may find grace.
[1:02:52] to help in the time that you need it.
[1:02:57] IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE I could find.
[1:03:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; THAT I MIGHT COME EVEN to his seat,
[1:03:08] Job knew that when he comes to the seat
[1:03:11] of God,
[1:03:13] come to God.
[1:03:18] &gt;&gt; When you COME TO THE SEAT,
[1:03:20] OF GOD. YOU HAVE COME TO THE presence of
[1:03:23] God.
[1:03:25] AND WHEN YOU COME to the PRESENCE OF
[1:03:26] GOD, I TELL YOU, CHURCH, you will never
[1:03:30] go back the same. Your life will never
[1:03:33] be the same. HE SAID, "COME UNTO ME ALL
[1:03:37] YE WHO LABOR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN.
[1:03:40] WHAT WILL I DO?" HE DIDN'T SAY, "I WILL
[1:03:42] JUDGE YOU." NO, SIR. HE SAID, "I WILL
[1:03:45] GIVE YOU REST."
[1:03:48] AMEN. What is that you're looking for
[1:03:50] tonight? God has got rest
[1:03:54] for your soul. Blessed be the name of
[1:03:56] the Lord Jesus. HE SAID, "I WOULD ORDER
[1:03:59] MY COURSE BEFORE HIM
[1:04:02] and fill my mouth with arguments."
[1:04:05] What is that? He would speak TO GOD. HE
[1:04:09] WOULD TELL HIM WHO HE IS. HE WOULDN'T
[1:04:12] HIDE ANYTHING.
[1:04:14] SPEAK TO GOD. They would tell you know I
[1:04:16] am Edison. You know I lasted yesterday.
[1:04:19] You know I told a LIE I CAN'T STAY AWAY
[1:04:21] FROM YOU. I HAVE COME JUST THE WAY I AM.
[1:04:24] I HAVE REALIZED ONE THING. I NEED YOU.
[1:04:27] WITHOUT YOU I AM GOING TO PERISH.
[1:04:31] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. AS THE HEART PED FOR
[1:04:33] WATERPROOF
[1:04:35] AS MY SOUL PSYTHER
[1:04:37] YOU FIND HIM OR YOU PERISH. Praise the
[1:04:41] Lord.
[1:04:43] IT'S A BOUNDARY BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH.
[1:04:47] The moment you know, THE MOMENT YOU
[1:04:49] DISCOVER THAT IF YOU DON'T FIND CHRIST,
[1:04:52] YOU ARE GOING TO PERISH. Then you will
[1:04:54] thirst. YOU WILL HUNGER FOR HIM. YOU
[1:04:57] WILL LOOK FOR HIM. YOU DESIRE FOR HIM.
[1:04:59] AND WHEN YOU DESIRE FOR HIM, you will be
[1:05:02] found.
[1:05:03] You will find him because God is
[1:05:06] available.
[1:05:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:05:09] He says, I WILL BLEED.
[1:05:12] HE SAYS, "I WOULD KNOW THE WORDS which
[1:05:14] he would answer me."
[1:05:17] WHAT A MOMENT that you COME BEFORE GOD
[1:05:21] AND TELL HIM who you are. Complain. Tell
[1:05:25] him who you are. JUST AS THE OTHER
[1:05:27] WOMAN, HANNAH, WENT AND SPOKE TO GOD.
[1:05:30] SHE WENT AND SPOKE HER AT.
[1:05:33] HALLELUJAH. WHAT DID GOD DO TO HER? DID
[1:05:36] HE CHASE HER WAY? NO. AH HE GRANTED THAT
[1:05:39] DESIRE.
[1:05:41] JOHN SAID I WOULD TELL HIM WHO I AM. I
[1:05:45] WOULD TELL HIM I WOULD FILL MY MOUTH
[1:05:46] WITH ARGUMENTS.
[1:05:49] AFTER telling him what happens I will
[1:05:52] know the words which he will answer.
[1:05:55] Well when you speak to Christ
[1:05:58] the proof that you are speaking to me he
[1:06:01] should be able to answer you BY WHEN YOU
[1:06:04] SPEAK TO HIM. OUR GOD IS NOT DEAD. IS A
[1:06:07] LIVING GOD. WHAT'S THE PROOF THAT HE'S
[1:06:10] ALIVE? HE ALWAYS SPEAKS BACK. YOU SPEAK
[1:06:13] TO HIM. HE SPEAKS BACK TO YOU. IT'S A
[1:06:16] SIGN THAT GOD IS ALIVE. GOD DOES NOT
[1:06:19] KEEP QUIET. HE TALKS TALKS TALK.
[1:06:23] IF YOU HAVE NOT HEARD HIM, IF YOU HAVE
[1:06:25] NOT HEARD GOD SPEAK,
[1:06:27] you have not yet gone to the throne
[1:06:30] to HIS SEAT.
[1:06:32] THOUGHT THEY HAVE FOUND HIM. WHEN YOU
[1:06:34] FIND HIS SPIRIT AND YOU SPEAK TO HIM, HE
[1:06:38] WILL SPEAK.
[1:06:40] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Blessed be the name of
[1:06:45] the Lord Jesus. Do you love the Lord?
[1:06:48] Give the Lord a shout of praise.
[1:06:53] He said, "I would know the words which
[1:06:56] he would answer
[1:06:58] and understand what he would say to me.
[1:07:01] Church, we've got to understand.
[1:07:05] It's one thing to know, it's another
[1:07:08] thing to understand. Praise the Lord.
[1:07:11] YOU CAN KNOW ED.
[1:07:13] THIS IS HIM. You know Ed because you are
[1:07:16] seeing me, BUT YOU MIGHT NOT UNDERSTAND.
[1:07:20] SO IT'S ONE THING to know, it's another
[1:07:22] thing to understand. PRAISE THE LORD.
[1:07:25] JOB SAID I WOULD KNOW THE WORDS. ONE,
[1:07:29] know the words. Know the words of the
[1:07:31] Lord, the words that have spoken. WHEN
[1:07:34] YOU HAVE KNOWN THE WORDS, seek
[1:07:36] understanding.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:07:42] &gt;&gt; You cannot
[1:07:44] you cannot follow the instructions of
[1:07:46] God.
[1:07:48] Even if they have been given to you, you
[1:07:51] cannot be able to follow the
[1:07:52] instructions
[1:07:54] until you have understood.
[1:07:58] Amen. Praise the Lord. YOU CAN NEVER
[1:08:02] FOLLOW CHRIST
[1:08:04] UNTIL YOU have understood Christ.
[1:08:07] HALLELUJAH.
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; MANY PEOPLE READ THE same Bible that
[1:08:12] Yes. BUT THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND.
[1:08:14] NO WONDER THEY CANNOT WALK
[1:08:19] and they read. Why? It's because they
[1:08:22] don't understand. One time there WAS A
[1:08:24] MAN CALLED PHILIP.
[1:08:26] He was moving and he met somebody. He
[1:08:28] was reading the Bible and he asked him,
[1:08:31] "Do you understand what you're reading?
[1:08:33] HOW WILL I UNDERSTAND
[1:08:35] UNTIL unless somebody explains it to
[1:08:37] you?"
[1:08:39] You will never understand
[1:08:42] until something has been explained.
[1:08:44] You say, "I will understand what you
[1:08:47] would say."
[1:08:48] Is that your desire that you want TO
[1:08:51] UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD SPEAKS TO YOU RIGHT
[1:08:54] NOW? GOD MIGHT BE SPEAKING. YOU ARE
[1:08:57] HEARING GOD SPEAKING, BUT SOME MIGHT NOT
[1:09:01] UNDERSTAND.
[1:09:04] That's right.
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, but God is speaking.
[1:09:08] BUT SOME might not understand.
[1:09:11] Deuteronomy 29:29
[1:09:13] THE SECRET THINGS BELONG UNTO THE LORD
[1:09:16] OUR God
[1:09:19] then I can understand
[1:09:23] blessed be the name of the Lord he said
[1:09:26] I would know which he would ANSWER ME
[1:09:29] YOU HAVE TOLD HIM YOUR SIN WHEN YOU HAVE
[1:09:32] CONFESSED YOUR SIN TO HIM IS HE going to
[1:09:34] plead against you to meet the pastor and
[1:09:37] when you meet THE MINISTER YOU SHARE
[1:09:40] A BROTHER, YOU ARE SCARED BECAUSE YOU
[1:09:43] THINK YOU HAVE SINNED AWAY YOUR DAYS OF
[1:09:45] GRACE. WELL, I TELL YOU, CHRIST HAS GOT
[1:09:49] MERCY.
[1:09:52] Come to the throne OF GRACE. IF ONLY I
[1:09:54] KNEW. IF ONLY I KNEW WHERE I COULD FIND
[1:09:58] HIM. I MIGHT COME INTO HIS SEAT.
[1:10:03] Praise the Lord. He says, will he bleed
[1:10:05] against me with his power?
[1:10:08] Hallelujah. The answer is there. He says
[1:10:12] no. Tell your neighbor no.
[1:10:17] God is not going to plead against you
[1:10:19] with his great heart.
[1:10:23] But what will he do, but he will put
[1:10:26] strength in me.
[1:10:28] Strength is for the weak.
[1:10:31] THE POWER OF GOD IS NOT FOR JUDGMENT.
[1:10:35] NO. What is it for? It is for
[1:10:38] strengthening the weak.
[1:10:42] God will put strength in you.
[1:10:47] Well, YOU NEED STRENGTH TONIGHT.
[1:10:50] COME TO HIS SEAT. GOD IS WAITING. HE'S
[1:10:53] EXPECTING YOU. AS THE SONG SAYS, OPEN
[1:10:57] WIDE ARE HIS ARMS OF GRACE. GOD IS
[1:11:00] EXPECTING YOU.
[1:11:02] IT'S NOT NEW.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SIN. IS NOT GOING TO SHOCK GOD.
[1:11:08] BUT I TELL YOU WHAT, BEFORE YOU
[1:11:10] COMMITTED IT, HE KNEW THAT YOU DO IT.
[1:11:14] IT'S NOTHING NEW. THERE'S NOTHING NEW
[1:11:16] BEFORE GOD. YOU'RE SCARED FOR NOTHING.
[1:11:19] GOD ALREADY KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
[1:11:22] HE'S WAITING FOR YOU TO COME.
[1:11:26] IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HERE WHO MIGHT HAVE
[1:11:29] SINNED, if you backslid, if you drifted
[1:11:32] away, I want you to know, it is not a
[1:11:36] secret to God.
[1:11:40] God knows you. He knows WHAT YOU DO.
[1:11:45] WHETHER it is night, WHETHER IT IS DAY,
[1:11:48] WELL, there's an eye that is watching
[1:11:51] you. SO WHATEVER YOU HAVE DONE CHURCH
[1:11:55] LET ME TELL YOU MY BROTHER MY SISTER GOD
[1:11:58] IS fully aware
[1:12:00] he has got the details OF YOUR SIN AND
[1:12:04] you know what he's waiting FOR YOU TO
[1:12:06] COME
[1:12:08] THAT HE MIGHT DO WHAT? That he will
[1:12:10] judge you? No. He's not waiting FOR YOU
[1:12:14] TO JUDGE YOU.
[1:12:15] He's waiting FOR YOU TO COME THAT HE MAY
[1:12:19] PUT strength in you.
[1:12:24] Hallelujah.
[1:12:26] &gt;&gt; Why do you STAY WITH YOUR WEAKNESS?
[1:12:29] WHY DO YOU SIT ON your weakness when
[1:12:31] there IS GRACE? WHEN THERE IS MERCY,
[1:12:35] when God is waiting, when he's expecting
[1:12:37] you, when you are the one delaying your
[1:12:39] blessing,
[1:12:42] it is you who is DELAYING YOUR VICTORY.
[1:12:45] God is waiting.
[1:12:48] He's seated ON HIS SEAT.
[1:12:51] WAITING FOR YOU TO COME AND TELL HIM BY
[1:12:54] YOURSELF. IT SHOULD NOT BE THE PASTOR
[1:12:57] AND REPORT YOU TO GOD. NO. GOD DOES NOT
[1:13:00] TAKE secondary information.
[1:13:02] God is waiting for you. He's waiting for
[1:13:05] the CONFESSION OF YOUR MOUTH. THAT'S
[1:13:07] WHAT HE WANTS.
[1:13:10] It will show that you are remorseful.
[1:13:13] And when he gets that, he will not judge
[1:13:16] you.
[1:13:18] No, he will put strength in you. And
[1:13:21] when he put strength in you, you will
[1:13:23] overcome. If you HAVE NOT BEEN
[1:13:25] PRAYERFUL, COME TO THE SEAT, GET YOUR
[1:13:28] STRENGTH and go and trouble the devil.
[1:13:32] Blessed be the name of the LORD JESUS.
[1:13:34] GOD IS COUNTING ON YOU. HE'S NOT GOING
[1:13:36] TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER PERSON BECAUSE YOU
[1:13:39] are weak. God is not going to look FOR
[1:13:41] ANOTHER ONE STRONG. HE'S LOOKING for the
[1:13:43] weak to strengthen.
[1:13:46] Hallelujah.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; He's looking for you,
[1:13:52] that weak one.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; That's the one he wants to manifest his
[1:13:56] power through. He wants to strengthen
[1:13:58] you. THEN PEOPLE WILL TESTIFY. THE BIBLE
[1:14:02] says well, when when there is therefore
[1:14:05] an opportunity,
[1:14:07] do good unto all men, especially those
[1:14:10] in the household of faith, leave that
[1:14:12] one alone. Is where THE BIBLE SPEAKS. HE
[1:14:16] SAYS THAT LET YOUR LIGHT SO SHINE
[1:14:20] BEFORE MEN THAT THEY WILL SEE YOUR GOOD
[1:14:22] WORKS
[1:14:24] and thank you. NO GLORIFY YOU. NO. AND
[1:14:29] DO WHAT? GLORIFY
[1:14:31] GOD BECAUSE IT IS GOD WHO HAS DONE IT.
[1:14:36] HALLELUJAH. God is waiting for the weak.
[1:14:41] THEY WILL KNOW THAT SURELY WE KNOW THAT
[1:14:44] BOY.
[1:14:47] IS GOD. THE EDISON WE KNEW 10 YEARS AGO
[1:14:52] is not the one we know. Sure. IT IS GOD.
[1:14:55] WHATEVER GOD DOES, HE WANTS TO GET THE
[1:14:58] GLORY TO HIM.
[1:15:00] EVERYTHING THAT GOD DOES. EVERYTHING
[1:15:02] THAT GOD DOES, HE DOES IT FOR ONE
[1:15:05] PURPOSE. THAT YOU MAY COLLECT THE GLORY
[1:15:08] FOR HIMSELF. IT IS FOR HIMSELF. GOD WILL
[1:15:12] PUT STRENGTH IN YOU. I MAY GET THE GLORY
[1:15:16] JUDGE YOU NOW BECAUSE THE DEVIL WILL
[1:15:18] REJOICE. THE DEVIL WILL REJOICE WHEN GOD
[1:15:21] JUDGES YOU. YOU KNOW THAT HE HAS warned
[1:15:23] about
[1:15:26] the WORD GOING TO COME AND PUT THE
[1:15:28] CONVICTION IN YOU.
[1:15:31] FATHER, DON'T IGNORE THAT VOICE. DON'T
[1:15:34] IGNORE that conviction.
[1:15:37] It is God WHO IS CALLING YOU. NO MATTER
[1:15:39] HOW WEAK YOU ARE, GOD IS CALLING YOU
[1:15:43] SPEAKING TO YOUR HEART. MY SON, MY
[1:15:45] DAUGHTER, I AM
[1:15:48] WHEN HE PUT STRENGTH IN YOU,
[1:15:51] it will be a bomb to the devil.
[1:15:55] The devil will be ashamed
[1:15:57] and he will take your his dirty fingers
[1:15:58] off your life.
[1:16:00] When is he going to plead against YOU
[1:16:02] WITH HIS GREAT POWER?
[1:16:04] He will put strength in you.
[1:16:07] Blessed be the name of Jesus.
[1:16:10] verses eight. He says, "Behold, I go
[1:16:12] forward,
[1:16:15] but it's not there and backward, I
[1:16:18] cannot perceive you." THIS MAN WAS
[1:16:21] THIRSTING
[1:16:22] FOR GOD. I was LOOKING FOR GOD. YOU IF
[1:16:26] ONLY I COULD FIND HIM, my problems are
[1:16:29] over. If I could find God, my weakness
[1:16:32] is over. If I could find God, this
[1:16:34] lasting is gone. If I could find God,
[1:16:37] his gossiping is gone. If I could find
[1:16:39] God, his prayerlessness is gone. If I
[1:16:42] could find God,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; hallelujah.
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; He says, "I go forward,
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; but he's not there and backward, but I
[1:16:55] cannot pass on the left hand where he
[1:16:58] does work, but I cannot BEHOLD HIM.
[1:17:03] HE HIDES HIMSELF ON THE RIGHT HAND.
[1:17:06] BUT I CANNOT SEE HIM. But this is the
[1:17:09] thing, brother. This is the thing,
[1:17:11] sister. This is what you going to go
[1:17:13] back to. Listen to this, my brother. He
[1:17:17] knows the way that I take you.
[1:17:24] Praise the Lord. You might not see God
[1:17:27] in your life,
[1:17:30] but he's seeing you.
[1:17:35] You might not feel him.
[1:17:38] The Bible says he's a high priest WHO IS
[1:17:42] TOUCHED
[1:17:44] BY WHAT you feel.
[1:17:47] HE'S TOUCHED BY THE FEELING OF
[1:17:50] INFIRMITY.
[1:17:51] YOU MIGHT NOT SEE GOD, BUT HE'S SEEING
[1:17:54] YOU. YOU CANNOT HIDE. HE KNOWS EACH TEAR
[1:17:58] THAT FALLS.
[1:18:00] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. HE KNOWS THE BURDEN IN
[1:18:02] YOUR HEART. HE KNOWS THE DESIRE OF YOUR
[1:18:05] HEART. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.
[1:18:08] EVEN BEFORE YOU ASK HIM, he knows it.
[1:18:13] He knows the way that I take you.
[1:18:16] God knows the way that YOU TAKE.
[1:18:19] I want to TELL YOU CHURCH, HE KNOWS IT.
[1:18:22] HE KNOWS IT. HE MIGHT BE SILENT NOW, BUT
[1:18:25] HE KNOWS IT.
[1:18:31] HE MIGHT HAVE KEPT QUIET FOR LONG, BUT I
[1:18:33] WANT TO TELL YOU, CHURCH, HE KNOWS IT.
[1:18:36] HE'S SEEING IT. HE KNOWS THE WAY THAT
[1:18:39] YOU TAKE. GOD KNOWS YOUR COMMITMENTS.
[1:18:44] He knows YOUR COMMITMENTS. HE KNOWS THE
[1:18:46] little that you are trying TO DO FOR
[1:18:48] HIM. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO
[1:18:50] FOR THE KINGDOM. GOD KNOWS. HE MIGHT
[1:18:53] HAVE NOT SAID THANK YOU. NOW,
[1:18:56] GOD KNOWS THE WAY THAT YOU
[1:18:59] HE KNOWS IT. He says he's a REWARDER
[1:19:04] of those
[1:19:06] who diligently seek.
[1:19:09] God will reward
[1:19:11] the reward because the way that I teach,
[1:19:16] you go forward. I can't find him on the
[1:19:20] backward. On the backward, I can't find
[1:19:21] him on the left side. I can't find him.
[1:19:24] On the right hand side, I CANNOT
[1:19:26] PERCEIVE HIM. I CAN'T BEHOLD MY LORD.
[1:19:28] NO PROBLEM. DON'T BE DISCOURAGED, MY
[1:19:31] BROTHER.
[1:19:32] YOU MIGHT HAVE NOT SEEN HIM ON THE LEFT.
[1:19:35] YOU MIGHT HAVE not seen him on the right
[1:19:36] hand. You might have not seen him
[1:19:37] anywhere. You might have not PERCEIVED
[1:19:39] HIM. BUT I WANT TO ANNOUNCE TO YOU
[1:19:41] TODAY. HE KNOWS THE WAY THAT YOU TAKE.
[1:19:45] God knows it.
[1:19:48] God knows it.
[1:19:50] He knows your effort.
[1:19:54] He knows it.
[1:19:56] You are not here because you don't have
[1:19:58] what to do.
[1:20:00] No,
[1:20:01] &gt;&gt; you've got all
[1:20:03] you have A LOT TO DO. BUT BECAUSE YOU
[1:20:06] TOOK A STEP TO COME TO THE HOUSE OF GOD,
[1:20:09] HE CHOSE THE WAY THAT
[1:20:13] HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Blessed be the name of
[1:20:19] he says when he has tried me
[1:20:26] when the Lord has tried.
[1:20:29] Praise the Lord. When he has tried me,
[1:20:32] what will happen? Will you be thrown
[1:20:35] away? Will you be burnt? Will you be
[1:20:38] forsaken?
[1:20:40] Praise the Lord. What will he do? He
[1:20:43] says, I shall come forth as kings.
[1:20:47] your trial is for the purpose
[1:20:51] PROVING TO THE DEVIL THAT YOU ARE GOD.
[1:20:56] WELL, the devil doesn't KNOW WHO YOU
[1:20:57] ARE. HE'S ONLY GUESSING. HE DOESN'T KNOW
[1:21:01] WHO YOU ARE. HE'S TRYING TO ACCUSE YOU
[1:21:04] BEFORE GOD. You know what GOD WILL DO?
[1:21:07] WHEN THE DEVIL ACCUSES YOU BEFORE GOD
[1:21:10] BECAUSE OF YOUR WEAKNESS, you know what
[1:21:12] God does? TAKES YOU ASIDE AND PUT
[1:21:15] STRENGTH IN YOU AND HE BRINGS A TRIAL.
[1:21:18] THEN YOU COME OUT AS GOD AND PROVE TO
[1:21:21] THE DEVIL THAT YOU ARE NOT WHAT HE
[1:21:23] THINKS.
[1:21:25] YOU ARE IN HEAVEN MATERIAL
[1:21:28] CHILD OF GOD. THAT'S WHAT OUR God does.
[1:21:32] When he EVER ACCUSES YOU BEFORE, GOD
[1:21:34] DOES NOT ASHAME YOU
[1:21:37] BECAUSE YOU A SON.
[1:21:40] WHEN GOD ASHAMES YOU DEFEATING HIS
[1:21:42] PURPOSE. WHEN GOD ASHAMES YOU, HE'S
[1:21:46] ASHAMING HIMSELF. YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE
[1:21:49] YOU ARE PART OF HIM.
[1:21:52] GOD CANNOT AFFORD TO EMBARRASS HIMSELF.
[1:22:01] AMEN.
[1:22:05] So the devil goes to him.
[1:22:08] You know what Edison has just done? THAT
[1:22:11] IS WHAT HE DOES. HE DID IT LAST WEEK. He
[1:22:14] did it today again.
[1:22:17] Then God will you know what God will do?
[1:22:20] God will put a conviction.
[1:22:26] It is dangerous
[1:22:28] to deny the call of God.
[1:22:32] WHEN YOU FEEL IN YOUR HEART, GOD IS
[1:22:34] CALLING YOU. He wants to cheat for you.
[1:22:37] Exactly.
[1:22:43] So when you MAKE THAT MISTAKE,
[1:22:46] WHEN YOU GET into that weakness,
[1:22:51] the devil goes to accuse you.
[1:22:54] Ah, you know what God does?
[1:22:56] He waits for the devil
[1:22:59] to go and roam to and fro
[1:23:06] you with himself.
[1:23:08] Then tells the devil, you know what?
[1:23:10] Yesterday he told me this about
[1:23:16] TRY HIM. TRY HIM. YOU KNOW WHAT? GOD
[1:23:20] KNOWS that when you are tried, YOU WILL
[1:23:24] COME OUT AS GOD.
[1:23:30] THERE WAS A woman who had an issue of
[1:23:33] blood. She had a witness. But when she
[1:23:36] came to Christ, it ceased.
[1:23:41] He's waiting for you
[1:23:43] to come,
[1:23:45] with a sincere heart,
[1:23:48] not with pretense,
[1:23:50] not with hypocrisy.
[1:23:52] Don't pray because somebody is PRAYING
[1:23:53] NEXT TO YOU.
[1:23:55] PRAY BECAUSE GOD HAS PUT IT IN YOUR
[1:23:57] HANDS.
[1:23:58] HALLELUJAH. THE TIME HAS COME THAT WE
[1:24:01] HAVE GOT TO HAVE INDIVIDUAL OVERNIGHTS.
[1:24:07] AMEN. That is you just shut in with God.
[1:24:11] Don't wait for Friday.
[1:24:13] Don't wait for the pastor.
[1:24:16] Don't wait for the church.
[1:24:18] A time has come for YOU TO FIND TIME
[1:24:21] WITH GOD.
[1:24:23] might plead your course
[1:24:29] that he might put strength in you
[1:24:32] so that when you come we will see that
[1:24:37] God has done a work
[1:24:41] when you pray shutting close the door
[1:24:46] speak to your God in
[1:24:49] you know what he does
[1:24:51] he who sees you in secret
[1:24:54] will reward you openly.
[1:24:58] God is not going to reward YOU IN
[1:24:59] SECRET.
[1:25:01] WHEN YOU PRAY in secret, God is going to
[1:25:04] reward you when your neighbors are
[1:25:05] singing.
[1:25:08] When your pastor is sing, when your
[1:25:10] friend in church is sing, when your wife
[1:25:12] is sing, when your daughter is sing,
[1:25:15] WHEN EVERYBODY AROUND you is sing,
[1:25:18] SURELY IS GOD who has done it.
[1:25:24] Praise God.
[1:25:26] Blessed be the name of the Lord. He
[1:25:29] knows the way that I take.
[1:25:32] When he has
[1:25:36] this, the secret. I'm about to close. I
[1:25:40] don't preach for long. Praise the Lord.
[1:25:43] Jeremiah 14:7.
[1:25:47] This is this is the attitude that we
[1:25:48] should have
[1:25:50] when we are going to pray.
[1:25:56] He says, "Oh Lord,"
[1:25:59] he's praying.
[1:26:03] He says, "Oh Lord, though our iniquities
[1:26:06] testify against us,
[1:26:10] I know that there's somebody here. Your
[1:26:14] iniquities
[1:26:16] testify against you even now as I speak.
[1:26:21] You know who you are. You know what you
[1:26:23] have done. As I'm speaking now, you know
[1:26:27] that I am the one.
[1:26:30] Well, there's still hope. Jeremiah said,
[1:26:33] "Though our iniquities,
[1:26:36] testify against us,
[1:26:39] do it for your name's sake.
[1:26:47] Praise the Lord.
[1:26:50] HE SAYS, "DO IT FOR your name's sake.
[1:26:54] FOR OUR BACKSLIDINGS ARE many
[1:26:59] as of truth.
[1:27:01] My iniquities
[1:27:04] testify against me.
[1:27:07] My backslidings are many.
[1:27:10] And it is not news to God.
[1:27:13] It's not going to be a shocker to him
[1:27:16] because they are new masses.
[1:27:20] Every day says your masses
[1:27:23] are new EVERY DAY.
[1:27:26] MY backslidings are many.
[1:27:29] Do it for your name's sake. You know
[1:27:31] what church?
[1:27:33] We carry the name of Christ.
[1:27:37] We have been named after him.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Is that amen?
[1:27:42] We carry his name.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; You are carrying the name of Christ. So
[1:27:47] for the SAKE OF THAT NAME FOR THE SAKE
[1:27:50] OF THAT TESTIMONY,
[1:27:52] GOD IS going to overlook that AND HE
[1:27:55] WILL DO it for the sake of his name.
[1:28:00] What are you waiting for? Why are you
[1:28:02] sitting on your sin? Why you why are you
[1:28:04] magnifying your weakness?
[1:28:06] Why you looking at yourself as a
[1:28:07] failure?
[1:28:09] You are not the first person to commit.
[1:28:11] Praise the Lord. I am ENCOURAGING YOU
[1:28:13] TODAY. RUN TO CHRIST. RUN TO HIM.
[1:28:19] He's calling you. He's calling you. His
[1:28:23] mercies are new to us every morning.
[1:28:27] His mercies. He says somewhere that
[1:28:30] everyone that thirstes, come to the
[1:28:33] come to the waters. Come to the waters.
[1:28:36] Hallelujah. Brother, I tell you when a
[1:28:39] man is really getting hungering and
[1:28:40] thirsting for God,
[1:28:44] he will receive it.
[1:28:46] That's what brother said in the message
[1:28:48] Elijah preached 1953
[1:28:52] October 18th paragraph 55.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; WHAT DOES HE SAY? BROTHER, I TELL YOU
[1:28:59] WHEN A MAN IS REALLY GETTING HUNGERING
[1:29:01] AND THIRSTING FOR GOD,
[1:29:04] he will receive it.
[1:29:11] Amen.
[1:29:12] &gt;&gt; You have not received it
[1:29:14] because You have not yet started hungry.
[1:29:19] When you GET HUNGRY FOR GOD, FASTING FOR
[1:29:22] GOD, you not wait to be told TO COME TO
[1:29:24] CHURCH. YOU NOT WAIT, YOU NOT WAIT TO BE
[1:29:27] TOLD TO PRAY AND FAST. YOU ARE NOT GOING
[1:29:30] TO WAIT.
[1:29:32] YOU WILL DO IT.
[1:29:35] He says when a man has got hungering and
[1:29:38] fasting,
[1:29:41] hallelujah, for God, HE WILL RECEIVE IT.
[1:29:46] BROTHER, SISTER, start hungering.
[1:29:50] Start fasting
[1:29:52] and you'll receive it.
[1:29:55] You'll receive it. I don't have anything
[1:29:57] to tell you. I am telling you, you will
[1:30:01] receive your heart
[1:30:05] because God has promised it.
[1:30:08] God cannot fail.
[1:30:11] When you take his word of promise
[1:30:13] and you take it by faith and you believe
[1:30:16] it, that is THE ONLY TRUTH. GOD IS
[1:30:19] obligated
[1:30:22] to fulfill it.
[1:30:24] It is his obligation.
[1:30:27] IT IS his obligation.
[1:30:30] That is the responsibility.
[1:30:34] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The trouble of
[1:30:36] it IS
[1:30:38] THAT THE CHURCH IS not hungry enough
[1:30:40] tonight for God.
[1:30:44] Well, that's where the problem is.
[1:30:46] &gt;&gt; That's where the problem is. That's
[1:30:48] where you are failing.
[1:30:51] Hallelujah.
[1:30:52] That's where you have failed.
[1:30:55] You are not yet hungry for God.
[1:30:58] You are hungry for the world.
[1:31:00] You are thirsting for the things of the
[1:31:02] world. You are NOT THIRSTING FOR GOD.
[1:31:05] YOU ARE HUNGRY FOR THE THINGS OF THE
[1:31:06] WORLD. You are hungry for God.
[1:31:10] That's why you are not receiving the
[1:31:12] Holy Ghost.
[1:31:15] Praise the Lord. And if you get thirsty
[1:31:18] for him and you get hungry for him, our
[1:31:21] prophet tells us you will receive it.
[1:31:27] The problem is you are not hungry
[1:31:28] enough.
[1:31:32] Praise the Lord.
[1:31:34] is the reason the Holy Spirit is not
[1:31:36] moving in the church.
[1:31:39] That's the reason the signs of the
[1:31:40] apostles
[1:31:42] well they say sometimes
[1:31:45] how does this healing and miracles and
[1:31:47] signs and wonders.
[1:31:50] He says it will work for you.
[1:31:54] It will work if you believe it.
[1:31:58] Amen. It will work
[1:32:01] if you believe it. Now I ask a question.
[1:32:05] What will happen if you don't believe
[1:32:06] it?
[1:32:09] It will not work. It is not working
[1:32:13] because you don't believe it. But when
[1:32:15] you believe it, it will work.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. It will work if you
[1:32:23] believe it. If you will take God at his
[1:32:26] word,
[1:32:28] it will produce.
[1:32:31] Friends, the word of God is productive.
[1:32:37] It is productive.
[1:32:39] If you take the word of God
[1:32:42] by faith and you believe it, it will
[1:32:45] yield the same results
[1:32:48] yielded in the days of the apostles.
[1:32:50] It will happen. Praise the Lord. If only
[1:32:54] it is taken by faith.
[1:32:57] We are not seeing signs. We are not
[1:32:59] seeing wonders.
[1:33:01] Because
[1:33:02] we are not certain of God.
[1:33:08] &gt;&gt; WE ARE STILL DEBATING.
[1:33:10] WE ARE STILL DOUBTING. WE ARE STILL
[1:33:12] STANDING WITH TWO LEGS. ONE, ONE IN
[1:33:16] CHRIST. You have not decided.
[1:33:20] Decide
[1:33:21] and you will see God moving in your
[1:33:23] life.
[1:33:25] Make a decision.
[1:33:27] The way Job met, you seek for God.
[1:33:32] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:36] If you believe it, it will work. He
[1:33:39] says, "God, let me live to prove that
[1:33:41] around the world that it is true."
[1:33:47] And so will it work today,
[1:33:50] tonight. It will work tonight, not
[1:33:53] tomorrow, not next week, not next year.
[1:33:58] IT WILL WORK HERE
[1:34:03] and take God at his word. It will
[1:34:06] happen. Not when you go back home.
[1:34:09] Praise the Lord. Not when you exit that
[1:34:11] door.
[1:34:13] It will happen here.
[1:34:19] Your desire,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; your blessing, your victory is within
[1:34:24] your disposal.
[1:34:28] It is at your reach.
[1:34:31] It is within you.
[1:34:34] You have not seen it because you have
[1:34:37] not sold for it.
[1:34:39] He says it will work tonight
[1:34:43] in drought or anything else.
[1:34:48] whether the sun is shining,
[1:34:51] whether there is darkness, whether there
[1:34:53] is light, whe
[1:35:01] praise the Lord. If you will meet God's
[1:35:04] condition,
[1:35:08] God will meet you on those grounds.
[1:35:13] What is the
[1:35:16] What is the condition of God? He's
[1:35:18] calling you to come. And when you come,
[1:35:24] but you've got to come to his condition.
[1:35:34] There are only three people who know.
[1:35:38] You, God, and Satan. The three of you
[1:35:41] know.
[1:35:44] Devil knows it. That's why he's accusing
[1:35:47] you before. And you also know that you
[1:35:50] have done it.
[1:35:53] Now God is calling you because he knows
[1:35:57] that you have done it and you also know
[1:36:00] that you have done it. Why run away?
[1:36:05] Why run away? He's calling you. He has
[1:36:08] seen your sin. HE HAS SEEN YOUR
[1:36:11] WEAKNESS.
[1:36:12] HE KNOWS WHAT YOU CANNOT DO.
[1:36:15] He knows that you desire to do it and
[1:36:17] yet you cannot do it.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; He knows it.
[1:36:24] God told Paul
[1:36:26] that
[1:36:28] you are my my strength is made perfect
[1:36:30] in a way.
[1:36:33] Look here. He said Paul
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; my grace
[1:36:40] &gt;&gt; have you heard it?
[1:36:42] He said, "My grace is sufficient for
[1:36:45] you."
[1:36:47] PAUL HAD A WEAKNESS. He went to God and
[1:36:49] said,
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; he said, "For this thing I BES
[1:36:56] three times,
[1:36:58] what is that thing that has pushed you
[1:37:00] to God?"
[1:37:03] Hallelujah.
[1:37:05] I thought I sold to God for his
[1:37:08] wickedness THAT HE MAY DEPART FROM ME.
[1:37:11] GOD SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT? It's not about
[1:37:13] the weakness.
[1:37:15] IT'S NOT ABOUT THE WEAKNESS. MY GRACE,
[1:37:19] MY GRACE, my grace is sufficient.
[1:37:26] The grace of God is sufficient for you
[1:37:29] is bigger than your weakness.
[1:37:32] Why run away? Why try to hide your
[1:37:34] weakness? Bring it to him. TELL GOD YOUR
[1:37:37] WEAKNESS. TELL HIM, "Hear the words that
[1:37:41] he will speak."
[1:37:43] AND THEN UNDERSTAND
[1:37:46] WHAT HE'S GOING TO ANSWER YOU. PAUL WENT
[1:37:48] TO HIM. He told him his weakness. Then
[1:37:51] he had the words. Oh, Paul,
[1:37:55] my my my my grace
[1:37:58] IS SUFFICIENT.
[1:38:00] WHEN HE HAD IT,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; it was revealed to him and then he
[1:38:04] understood.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:38:09] &gt;&gt; Paul said, "When I want to do good, I
[1:38:12] find myself
[1:38:14] when I want to do good, I find myself
[1:38:16] doing bad. I don't know WHAT TO DO. WOE
[1:38:19] UNTO ME." THE SAME PAUL WHEN HE
[1:38:22] CONFESSED HIS WEAKNESS, he came out
[1:38:24] afterward. He said, "You know what?
[1:38:27] Longer I living."
[1:38:33] HALLELUJAH.
[1:38:33] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOW CHRIST.
[1:38:36] YOU KNOW WHY IT WAS CHRIST now living?
[1:38:39] Because he went to him with his
[1:38:40] weakness.
[1:38:42] Go to him WITH YOUR WEAKNESS. TELL HIM
[1:38:44] WHO YOU ARE.
[1:38:46] Jesus is on the MAIN LINE.
[1:38:50] TELL HIM WHAT YOU WANT. TELL HIM WHO YOU
[1:38:52] ARE. IF YOU WANT THE HOLY GHOST, SPEAK
[1:38:55] TO HIM. TELL HIM I'M WEAK. BUT I KNOW
[1:38:57] WHEN I GET YOUR LIFE IN ME, THEN I WILL
[1:39:00] BE STRONG. HE WILL GIVE YOU. God will
[1:39:03] grant you. the desire of your heart.
[1:39:07] Stop running away. Run back to him. RUN
[1:39:10] BACK TO HIM. DON'T RUN AWAY from him
[1:39:12] because you'll run to your you will
[1:39:14] perish.
[1:39:16] You run to your death. DON'T RUN AWAY
[1:39:18] FROM HIM. RUN TO HIM. HE WILL PUT
[1:39:21] STRENGTH IN YOU. Then you will live.
[1:39:26] Amen. May the Lord bless you.
[1:39:29] Amen.
[1:39:31] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:34] Blessed father of Jesus, we thank you
[1:39:37] for your grace for Lord. Though we may
[1:39:40] seek you and you seem not to be found of
[1:39:43] us, BUT YOU HAVE ASSURED US THAT YOU
[1:39:46] KNOW THE WAY THAT WE TAKE
[1:39:49] WHEN YOU have tried us, we will come
[1:39:52] forth as God. Thank you for that blessed
[1:39:55] Lord. We thank you for your grace. We
[1:39:58] thank you for your mercies that are new
[1:40:00] to us EVERY MORNING. LORD, WE HAVE BEEN
[1:40:03] RUNNING AWAY from you. Now we are
[1:40:05] running back. We are running back to
[1:40:07] you. We are running back to you. You
[1:40:10] made a reconciliation.
[1:40:12] YOU MADE A RECONCILIATION. YOU RESTORED
[1:40:15] THE RELATIONSHIP.
[1:40:17] OH MY LORD, we have come back. We know
[1:40:20] that you'll not receive. We know you not
[1:40:22] receive us. There was that prodigal son.
[1:40:26] He wasted AWAY HIS BLESSINGS. OH, BUT
[1:40:29] WHEN HE CAME BACK, HIS FATHER RECEIVED
[1:40:31] IT. AND YOU PUT A RING ON HIS FEET,
[1:40:34] LORD. WE ARE ALSO THE SAME. LORD, WE ARE
[1:40:36] COMING BACK. WE MIGHT HAVE WASTED OUR
[1:40:38] WAY, but we ARE COMING BACK NOW. WE KNOW
[1:40:41] YOU ARE WAITING FOR US. WE KNOW YOU'RE
[1:40:43] NOT GOING TO CAST US AWAY. You are
[1:40:45] waiting with a robe to put on us.
[1:40:49] You are waiting with a ring of gold
[1:40:52] on our finger. You are not TAKING US AS
[1:40:54] SERVANTS. OH,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; you are taking us back to our position.
[1:41:01] You are putting us as our in our
[1:41:02] position as sons AND DAUGHTERS. YOU ARE
[1:41:06] WAITING FOR us to come THAT YOU MAY
[1:41:08] RESTORE US
[1:41:10] TO our position. Blessed be your name of
[1:41:13] God. We thank you for that grace. Thank
[1:41:16] you for that word. Thank you for your
[1:41:18] encouragement. Lord, you are still with
[1:41:20] us. Lord, we have come. Forgive us Lord
[1:41:24] where we have errored. There's anything
[1:41:27] which we know that is there THAT WE HAVE
[1:41:29] DONE THAT HAS BROUGHT SHAME AND
[1:41:31] REPRESSION.
[1:41:33] Oh Lord, there is that cross that is
[1:41:36] still dripping with blood. Wash us with
[1:41:38] your
[1:41:40] help Lord that father will be like you.
[1:41:43] Make us more like you.
[1:41:46] Your image
[1:41:48] us Lord. Draw us to yourself that we'll
[1:41:51] be perfected. Even as you Lord,
[1:41:57] we can do all things through you. God
[1:42:01] bless you. God bless you. God bless you
[1:42:03] abundantly.
[1:42:08] Let us stand our feet.
[1:42:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:13] &gt;&gt; Let us give the Lord another clap of
[1:42:15] praise.
[1:42:20] Amen.
[1:42:22] Let us sing. He abides.
[1:42:26] Amen. Now, I believe that that was the
[1:42:28] Lord speaking to us tonight
[1:42:31] in the in the Ephesian church age.
[1:42:34] He says the bride, she's a a beaten
[1:42:36] work,
[1:42:40] handcrafted
[1:42:43] of beaten gold
[1:42:45] according to her blueprints which were
[1:42:47] spirit given.
[1:42:57] What he is, she is to reflect.
[1:43:03] What he has, she is to manifest.
[1:43:09] There is no fault in her.
[1:43:12] Amen. She is all glorious within and
[1:43:15] without,
[1:43:18] from beginning to ending.
[1:43:20] from beginning
[1:43:22] to ending. You know what amazes me is
[1:43:25] that when he saw you, when he saw me, he
[1:43:27] did not see me at the beginning only. He
[1:43:30] saw me at the beginning, but he saw me
[1:43:32] at the end.
[1:43:40] And what did he see? She is the work of
[1:43:43] her Lord.
[1:43:45] And all his works are perfect.
[1:43:48] Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; In fact, in her is summed up and
[1:43:53] manifested the eternal wisdom and
[1:43:56] purpose of God.
[1:44:01] You see that is why brother sister when
[1:44:04] you go through some thing in your life
[1:44:08] maybe a law
[1:44:10] a law
[1:44:12] and uh you feel that you know there's a
[1:44:14] song which says I've sinned and there is
[1:44:17] no use to pray
[1:44:20] and then he says I look AWAY TO JESUS
[1:44:23] WHO tells me to say
[1:44:26] I see a crimson stream of blood
[1:44:29] which flows from Calvary
[1:44:32] You know, a pretender,
[1:44:36] someone who is not truly a son or
[1:44:37] daughter of God,
[1:44:40] when something wrong goes on in your
[1:44:41] life,
[1:44:44] you just blush it away
[1:44:46] and you live on.
[1:44:48] But if you are a true child of God and
[1:44:51] something wrong happens in your life,
[1:44:54] you cannot cover it up.
[1:44:57] You You're going to hunger.
[1:44:59] You are going to thirst for something
[1:45:02] better.
[1:45:03] Like that prodical son, he hungered and
[1:45:06] thirsted for
[1:45:08] his father. He said, "Let me go to my
[1:45:10] father. LET ME PUT THIS THING right
[1:45:14] even if he doesn't accept me as A SON.
[1:45:17] AT LEAST HE WILL ACCEPT ME as a son. But
[1:45:20] it is better. Amen. To be in my father's
[1:45:23] house AS A SERVANT AND TO PERISH OUT
[1:45:28] THERE IN THE WORLD. Our thirst and
[1:45:31] hunger
[1:45:33] should be after God.
[1:45:35] And as a son of God, daughter of God,
[1:45:40] you remember this
[1:45:42] that you may look around in your life
[1:45:47] and you don't see God.
[1:45:50] But then you remember,
[1:45:52] God sees you.
[1:45:54] God knows you.
[1:45:58] That's what should always encourage us.
[1:46:05] Amen. He knows the way that you take.
[1:46:10] Let us sing. He knows. We'll sing abides
[1:46:13] afterwards.
[1:46:18] I have
[1:46:21] a maker.
[1:46:26] Sing it with me now with all your heart.
[1:46:28] He formed
[1:46:30] my heart
[1:46:38] before
[1:46:40] even time began.
[1:46:45] My life
[1:46:48] was in
[1:46:50] his hand.
[1:46:53] Well,
[1:46:54] he knows.
[1:46:57] He knows
[1:46:59] my name.
[1:47:04] He knows.
[1:47:07] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:47:09] my
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my every thought.
[1:47:13] He sees.
[1:47:18] each
[1:47:20] that falls
[1:47:23] and hears me when
[1:47:27] I go.
[1:47:31] I have a father. Say it with me now. I
[1:47:35] have
[1:47:36] a father.
[1:47:41] He calls me his own.
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; He calls
[1:47:45] me
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; his own.
[1:47:50] He'll never leave me.
[1:47:52] He'll never
[1:47:55] leave
[1:47:58] me. Think about that. No matter
[1:48:02] where
[1:48:04] I go.
[1:48:06] Oh,
[1:48:08] he knows.
[1:48:11] He knows. He knows my name.
[1:48:18] in all
[1:48:24] my every soul
[1:48:27] is.
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:48:32] Thank you, Lord Jesus.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; That falls
[1:48:37] and
[1:48:39] be
[1:48:42] I have a father. Close your eyes and
[1:48:45] sing it with me now. I have a father.
[1:48:48] I have
[1:48:50] a father.
[1:48:54] Say he called me his own.
[1:48:57] He called me
[1:49:00] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:49:03] He'll never leave me.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; No matter.
[1:49:14] No matter.
[1:49:16] away.
[1:49:18] I know.
[1:49:21] Oh,
[1:49:23] he knows.
[1:49:25] He knows
[1:49:27] my
[1:49:29] my
[1:49:32] He knows.
[1:49:35] He knows
[1:49:37] my
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; my
[1:49:40] thought.
[1:49:42] is
[1:49:46] all deep
[1:49:49] that falls
[1:49:52] and hears me when
[1:49:56] I go
[1:50:02] with every eye closed. Saints before we
[1:50:04] leave and
[1:50:09] maybe you want to say Lord that was
[1:50:11] mine.
[1:50:14] That is me that you spoke to.
[1:50:21] What God has placed in the heart of a
[1:50:24] child
[1:50:27] is to cry when she needs milk.
[1:50:32] She doesn't even know what she needs
[1:50:34] maybe. But that that thirst in the child
[1:50:39] makes her to cry out.
[1:50:41] If there is a deep
[1:50:44] calling, there is a deep response.
[1:50:49] If you're a daughter son of God,
[1:50:52] when you are living in a life that is
[1:50:53] not right,
[1:50:55] somehow there will be something in you
[1:51:00] calling for something better.
[1:51:02] There is a thirst. There is a hunger
[1:51:06] that God places in you.
[1:51:09] The fact that you have that hunger and
[1:51:11] thirst
[1:51:13] declares that you are a child of God.
[1:51:16] And it declares that there is something
[1:51:18] better somewhere for you.
[1:51:22] That's why if you don't have a hunger
[1:51:24] and a thirst,
[1:51:26] there is something wrong.
[1:51:28] There is something wrong.
[1:51:32] But if you're a child of God, you cannot
[1:51:35] settle for less. You want something
[1:51:37] better. You want to live a better life.
[1:51:40] You want to walk right with God. You
[1:51:43] want to walk live a dedicated life.
[1:51:46] Where are you friends? As we are
[1:51:48] beginning this year, this being the
[1:51:50] first month of the year,
[1:51:53] how are you going to live your life?
[1:51:56] Because without this hunger, without
[1:51:59] this thirst to be even in his presence,
[1:52:02] filled with his spirit, you cannot
[1:52:05] overcome.
[1:52:08] For we need his spirit. When he fills
[1:52:10] us, then he sends us to the testing.
[1:52:15] Then he sends us to the
[1:52:19] to all the trials and things and but
[1:52:22] somehow there is something within us
[1:52:23] that hold
[1:52:26] and that's what we need. You can't get
[1:52:29] it without hungering
[1:52:32] after him.
[1:52:34] Maybe you want to slip out your hand and
[1:52:36] say, "Lord, I'm
[1:52:40] that sermon today was mine.
[1:52:45] Lord, I'm crying out for something in my
[1:52:46] life
[1:52:49] that you may come
[1:52:52] and fill me.
[1:52:54] Let us pray together.
[1:52:57] Loving Jesus.
[1:53:00] Perhaps there are people here with their
[1:53:02] hands up.
[1:53:05] You know each one.
[1:53:07] For there is one thing that I know.
[1:53:11] If you allow a servant of God to come
[1:53:13] behind this pullpit
[1:53:17] and permit them to speak things like we
[1:53:19] had tonight,
[1:53:22] it's only because you're discerning
[1:53:23] someone's heart.
[1:53:27] a child of God. You are reaching out to
[1:53:31] someone that has perhaps gone astray and
[1:53:33] you're pulling them back again,
[1:53:37] reminding them because they have this
[1:53:40] hunger and thirst.
[1:53:42] There is something better for them.
[1:53:45] Lord, I pray that you will come and meet
[1:53:48] each one. Lord,
[1:53:51] let your presence fill our hearts.
[1:53:54] May we be on fire for God.
[1:53:58] Lord. May you come and forgive sin.
[1:54:01] Come and wash us. Let your Holy Spirit
[1:54:04] come in our hearts, oh God,
[1:54:06] in each one, Father that is hungering
[1:54:09] for you that is desiring you, Lord. Come
[1:54:13] and take over, Lord Jesus. For we are
[1:54:16] your children, oh God. And we know that
[1:54:19] you know our name.
[1:54:21] You know every tear that falls. When no
[1:54:24] one understands, Lord, you understand
[1:54:26] because you're the God that understands
[1:54:29] and you are touched by the feelings of
[1:54:30] our infirmities and you understand
[1:54:33] whatsoever thing that my brother sister
[1:54:35] is going through Lord and you are coming
[1:54:37] down right at their address. Take over
[1:54:40] Father to move in their lives to prove
[1:54:43] to them I am the Lord and I fail not for
[1:54:47] I put strength in you.
[1:54:50] Thank you Lord Jesus. I need more of
[1:54:53] that strength.
[1:54:55] My brother here needs it. My sister here
[1:54:57] needs it. Grant it, Lord, that you come
[1:55:01] and abide.
[1:55:03] It's my prayer, my cry.
[1:55:06] Grant it, Lord.
[1:55:14] I have
[1:55:17] a father.
[1:55:24] He calls
[1:55:26] me his own.
[1:55:34] He'll never
[1:55:36] leave
[1:55:38] me.
[1:55:41] No matter
[1:55:43] where
[1:55:45] I go,
[1:55:48] sing it.
[1:55:50] He knows.
[1:55:52] He knows
[1:55:55] my name.
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; He knows.
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; He knows
[1:56:04] my name. My
[1:56:07] every thought
[1:56:09] is se

[1:57:19] whatever will be given for your king. We
[1:57:22] just love you, Lord. We give ourselves
[1:57:24] to you. We pray that you'll also bless
[1:57:26] the speaker tonight.

[1:57:31] his family.

[1:57:36] he has used. And father, Lord, bless him
[1:57:39] abundantly. And whenever he stands,
