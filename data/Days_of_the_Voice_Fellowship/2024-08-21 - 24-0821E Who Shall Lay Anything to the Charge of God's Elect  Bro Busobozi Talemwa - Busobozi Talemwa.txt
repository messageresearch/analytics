requested by evening light bride Tabernacle to also share with them on Zoom we greet all the saints there also those that are here tonight amen so let us pray and then we shall read in Romans 8 father we want to approach your throne of Mercy this evening with humility with reverence knowing that you only can be able to give us the revelation of your word we have a hunger in our heart we have a thir that we may hear from you that you may fill our hearts Lord as you spoke to that woman and you said that you can give her the water never thirst again Grant it to us tonight that we will be beneficiaries of your living water grant it Lord as I ask this blessings in Jesus we would like to take a reading from Romans chap 8 vers 31 amen amen if you're there just say Amen so uh will begin okay can begin from 31 what shall we what shall we then say to the to these things if God be for us who can be against [Music] us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all all how shall he then not with him also freely give us all [Music] things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifi [Music] who is he that condemn condemneth it is Christ that died yeah rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us what it is amen amen I'd like us to also look at vers 35 who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword vers 37 nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded that neither day death no life No Angels no principalities no powers no things present no things to come no height no depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord [Music] say you may be seated praise the Lord so this evening I'm I'm having a small sharing and I'd like to speak on who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect actually if you want to see it it's on vers 33 where it says who shall lay anything to the charge of God is [Music] elect and um uh it is God that justifi so I'm speaking on who shall lay anything to the charge of God El and maybe for an inspiration is Justified I'm Justified all charges dismissed tell your neighbor I'm Justified all charges dismissed hallelujah how many believe that amen praise the name of the Lord so today I just want us to um have a few minutes maybe of course less than one hour because um about 54 minutes whenever we are speaking to evening light we do not go more than one hour I know there are some who stream and they be like like Pastor you were just beginning and then you you stopped so but uh we trust that this little sharing will be a blessing to to you tonight amen now first of all I want to speak on um the love of God how how many love God here can you prove it you can only prove that you love God if you obey his word but how can God prove that he loves us God can only prove that he loves us because he chose you that's the only way God can prove his love for and I'll begin with a quote here from thean church ede and I read this portion when I was speaking on the proof of of God's love so I'll read it again tonight now the Lord God Almighty says I know this is when he was speaking to the church agent said I Know Thy works I know your [Music] tribulation the church was suffering the church was going through a tribulation but the only thing that Jesus said said he said I know he said I know so he let them go through the tribulation he let them go through the suffering but then he simply said I know he never did pull them out of the suffering he never did pull them out of the troubles they were going through and this offends many people because then they ask questions like if God was really caring why if God loves Humanity why does he let them go through [Music] trouble if God loves human beings why did he let Satan come why didn't he just destroy him so that mankind can be saved but he simply says I know what I'm going through and there he is walking in the midst of his people there he is the chief Shepherd of the flock but does he hold back the persecution does he stem the tribulation no he does not he simply says I know your tribulation I am not at all unmindful of your suffering what a stumbling block this is to so many people like Israel they wonder if God really loves them I wonder if there is someone here this evening that has been wondering whether really God loves them because you have questions if God loves me why why this why that why that but you see how can God be just and loving if he stands by and watches me suffer that is what they asked in Malachi 1 1 verse 1-3 which says the burden of the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi I have loved you sayth the Lord yet you say wherein hast thou loved us was not es Jacob's brother sayith the Lord yet I loved Jacob and I hated Esau and I laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness and and he says I loved Jacob and I hated es you see they could not figure out God's love of course this scripture was speaking to Israel and God was telling them look if you're saying I don't love you I loved Jacob and I hated es and of course Israel was out of Jacob of course we know Jacob was changed his name to Israel so he was the patriarch there so so he's proving to them that he loved Jacob and he hated Esau you see they couldn't figure out God's love they thought that love and I I have to finish reading this quot they thought that love meant no suffering they thought that love meant a baby with parental care but God said that his love was elective love yes the proof of his love is election that no matter what happen his love was proven truly by the fact that they were chosen unto salvation God has proven or proved his love for me by the fact that he chose me unto salvation he chose me to be saved are you following me church because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit I wonder if the St can be reduced is quite a lot okay listen it says because God has chosen you to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit you you have to say this to yourself God chose me to s to Salvation through sanctification of the spirit and belief of the truth he commit you to death as he did Paul he may commit you to suffering as he did job did God love Paul did God love job and yet Paul died he was killed and yet job died he suffered a lot of suffering that is his prerogative God decides what each of us goes through in this life we even say some through the waters some through the fire but all through the blood that is his prerogative what we go through God is Sovereign but it is all with a purpose tell your neighbor everything is for a purpose if you did not have a purpose then he would have been the author of frustration and not of but his purpose is that after we have suffered a while we would be made perfect we would be established we would be strengthened and we would be set on as job said he put strength in us so you see uh when God when God has chosen somebody he does not just choose someone because of how they look he doesn't choose someone because of what they have done let me say that again God doesn't choose you because of how you look or because of what you have done or because of what you have not done if you understand that say amen God does not choose you after he SE you as human beings when a man is looking for a wife 99% of them want to see the beauty the outside the [Music] packaging I want to see how do their eyes look like how is their skin color how is their figure how is their hair and these are the things you know younger men always want to look at but God is not like man God is God God God even looked and oh my God he chose you before he looked at you your physical amen God chose you before you even came to be his choice of you was before the foundation of the [Music] world his choice of me was not here but was in him in Ephesians 1 ver4 he says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world so God chose me in him before the foundation of the world that we now what did he choose me to be you know when when human beings choose human beings beings can fail them and that's why relationships fail many relationships fail and that's why when you are choosing a relationship you must choose it in Christ be in Christ and let the other person be in Christ and choose whatever you choose in Christ whatever you choose in Christ can never fail because it was in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world okay let me put it in plain language if you choose a wife from the mind of Christ if God gives you a wife that marriage can never fail if you give yourself a wife or a husband that marriage can fail but if it is God who has given to you it cannot fail everything from God is permanent because God is eternal God is not a man is doesn't see things as a man God sees the end right at the beginning at the beginning is able to determine and see the end so that is why we believe in Prophecy prophecy is the revelation of the future God shows you what will be and this Bible is a book of Prophecy God declares what will be and whatever he said will be has to be so you see now when God chose you okay I don't know whether you believe it when God chose me before the foundation of the world he chose me in him so what did he choose me to become she chose me that I may be holy and Without Blame he chose me to be holy and to be blameless before him so in other words when God chose me he saw me before he chose me he saw he saw me in him and then he chose me in him what did he see he saw a holy person what did he see he saw a blameless person amen having predestinated an unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will just open your mind now as as we we continue here it's a very interesting thought he CHS Us in him before the foundation of the world I want you to think about it before your father Met Your Mother God chose you before you were born God chose you before you did any good or any bad God chose you do you see how deeper it gets so he did not Choose You on the basis of your good works and he cannot reject you on the basis of your bad works because that was not the basis of his choice amen the basis of his choice was his forign knowledge what did he know he knew you would be holy he knew you would be blameless he knew you would be perfect and what God knew cannot fail because he saw it before it was brought into manifestation but what you and people see is your good works or your bad works but with God much Beyond he sees beyond that amen and that is why the scripture say who shall lay anything to the charge of God is anything who shall chge anything to the Church of God is who elect because I am an elect I am blameless because I am an I am Holy I am who I am not because of what I am I've done or what I've failed to do I am who I am because of what God Said I am amen and that's why Believers love the word because the word is a revelation of who we are amen the more of the word you the more confirmation happens you conform yourself to the word you renew your mind to the word let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus you see the same mind why because the word amen reminds you of who truly you are you see he said here to be holy he he he chose us in him in him before the foundation of the world to be what holy are you following now to be holy and Without Blame I want us to understand that phrase there also power back to be he shows us in him to be holy and Without Blame before him in love now why did he do it in love because it's only love that could do it if it wasn't love we would be unworthy after we have come to manifestation because when we were manifested into the world we were manifested into a body of sin the Bible says we were born in sin shed in iniquity we came to the world speaking lives a child very little child we start telling lies the moment she or he begins to understand why because this is a body of Sin Sin born in sin born according to the lust of the flesh but what I'm saying s there is another you that is not this body another you that is not this flesh when I'm preaching to you right now your flesh is not hearing this word your flesh is actually Bor your flesh is actually tired your flesh doesn't want to your flesh doesn't even want to be here some of you L Dred it to come but when you begin hearing the word it activates something within you and you feel like life is building something is building on the inside you are becoming stronger and stronger and stronger until even your flesh becomes activated by the said even to the extent sometimes that even your flesh can't help it but to speak in tongues why because your flesh has entered into another room what I'm preaching to tonight I'm preaching to that inner man I'm preaching to that Soul I'm preaching to he amen that was in God before the foundation of the world he that God chose in him before the foundation of the world and how did he choose him he chose you in love tell your neighbor he chose you in love praise the name of the Lord in the Book of Proverbs 10:12 hatred sth up stripes but love all SE hallelujah amen hallelujah amen what people call love is not love many times what people call love is actually L if a young man can tell a young lady that I love you after they use them they dump them after they make them pregnant they Dison and the babies it was that love that was last it was not love so there is lust there is prostitution all the kind of Filth but it is always called love mistakenly that's not love and a person will tell you I love you someone can even kneel down someone can even literally cry the way they mean it because it is real according to the flesh it is human love but human love has an expir period you know Peter had it and that's the love he told he told Jesus even all the others forsake you I will never for second I will be where you are when they kill you I'll be there when they beat you I'll be there when I arrest you I'll be there and the moment they just started beating Jesus and a little child came to to Peter he said you one of them Peter changed his mind he said little what are you talking about I've never seen the man don't know the man at all three times the man rejected Jesus did he truly love Jesus was he meaning those words sure he was meaning them humanly speaking and that fails but there is a love I'm speaking about here that cannot fail that is God the Bible says God is love that is what it call Charity and he says charity never fail he he says Love cover all sins that's the love I'm speaking about the love he says you know it's not puffed up does not seek her own is not self-centered you know in First Peter 4 he says and above all things have fent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins there is only one thing that cannot fail and that is love but not human love now AG that is God's own life that's why you cannot truly genuinely love an unbeliever unbeliever can genuinely love you with which with what will he love you with he does not have the love of God are you following me okay now you say well you know when you when when you see in the scriptures God said Jacob have I loved but have I hated come to think of it Isaac their father loved Who Loved is Jacob so he was a man he was a human and the Bible says he loved is but with what kind of love not because God loved Jacob not es so there is no way Isaac could love Esau with the love of God there is only one kind of love of God and that is the one which does not fail but as this man said he loved Esau he ended up giving the blessing to Jacob so was that genuine love you say he was was deceived J When Love cannot be deceived J When Love is perfect and so when you know see how now oh my the Bible is just so sweet oh my when when you get into it you just enjoy it so I want you to see verse four he says according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love did you get that so it has it has to be by love or in love it could not be possible for us to be holy and blameless without love why because love covers a multitude of sins God's love never fails where there are Tong they shall fail where there are gifts it shall cease where there is all the things it shall stop but love never fails he chose us to be holy he CH us to to have to have no blame amen not our Holiness but his Holiness you know our Holiness is as few through Rags as the Bible says so in other words friends he has made us you know what love does love picks the filth and makes something beautiful out of Hallelujah am so what love does no human can do because God loved you for God so loved the world that he even gave His only begotten God gave his treasure in the we know that when we say begotten son we're talking about God himself powering himself in a man on Earth God Amen Jesus was a gift powered out God powered himself out when the devil thought he had finished the human Rest by corrupting it through and Adam he did not know God still had love amen and while he had thought he had destroyed everything amen God was just beginning and the only thing that God could use was love God himself came amen maybe all the Angels wanted to come and save the situation maybe W tried Michel tried Gabel tried but he told them no with this it has to be love only love can do this and the Bible says God is love God himself had to come and leave his glory down from Glory he he came down from glory and he condescended down to the lowest he was God but yet he made himself as a man to the extent he was killed on the cross what was that it was love he made us we've not made ourselves there is something I want us to get to tonight I want you to understand when we talking about being blameless and being holy it's not you that struggles to say oh my God like like brother said one time people say oh i s God I S God I S God he said you don't seek God it is God who seeks and after you when Abraham when Adam sinned and Eve they just ran away they didn't seek after God but what did God do love brought him down said I don't know what I have been without his love amen it is him who seeks after me it is him who looks after me it is him who has made me what I am it is him who is changing me every day it is love he has made us in Revelation of Jesus Christ it says he has made us oh there is a certain truth that we need to emphasize this is one of them he he he has made us just say he has made me it will make sense to you if you say it just say it he has made me salvation is his doing salvation is is of the Lord you remember when those three Hebrew children when they were cast down into the fire you know I believe all the Angels brother would say wanted to come and say but he could not allow any of them to come because it was his word hallelujah amen and when the king opened his eyes he said did we throw only three boys into this fire but look there looks to be four of them and the fourth one looks like the sound of Mark oh my god do you understand what this means the fourth one looks like God himself amen am Jesus wasn't even born yet but Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever the same one who came in the fire storm then he comes in your storm today he comes in your battles today he comes in my fight today hallelujah amen and so he has made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed the for a purpose tell your neighbor he redeemed you for a purpose amen he B us for a purpose we are Kings We Are Spiritual oh we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now oh my I love this whenever I read it can we read it together but now we are spiritual Kings and we re over our spiritual kingom Hallelujah now brother son we Are Spiritual Kings if you don't see it then you don't understand understand the things of the spirit but according to the things of the spirit amen we are in another kingdom our kingdom is not of the earth our kingdom is of above and we are reigning with him he made us we did not make ourselves it says in Romans 5:17 for If by one man is offense death reigned by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness oh my God I just wish you people were getting everything that I'm talking about it's just so delicious here he says and of the he says how much more they which receive the abundance of Grace did you hear that you just receive it Hallelujah this is you know take it it is for taking it is not for grabbing and fighting and you know say work out your salvation with fear and trembling I'm working out I am friends it's not about struggling do not struggle It Is by Grace do not struggle It Is by faith am amen he says you just have to receive it amen he says we have received the abundance of Grace and we have also received of the gift of righteousness and because of that it says we shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ wish would give me that scripture here look at it I want to look at those words amen he says and of the gift of righteousness meaning we receive Grace but also we receive the gift of righteousness and because of this we shall reign because of this we shall re did you get it now because of you receiving all of Grace and because of you receiving all of righteousness as a gift of God you shall by one that is Jesus Christ and in Colossians 1:3 who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom into the rain the kingdom of his dear son now says right now we reign with Christ right now right now having dominion over sin did you now get the point we are reigning in a spiritual Kingdom hallelujah amen there are many things which would want to consume you which have consumed many others out there it doesn't take anything for you to become a prostitute it doesn't take anything for you to become a a bum but you know what friends there is a power amen what is the power is the power of Grace it's the power of His grace the power of his love that has made us Kings and has made us priests what are we Kings over say we have we are reigning with Christ oh my come on receive it open your spiritual mind to receive it receive it by Revelation amen we are right now reigning over another kingdom with Christ having dominion over sin that point there is what separates the message with the Pentecost the Pentecost will preach everything I preached so far will stop there but they will never come to this place but thank God for Malachi because he told us Grace not disgrace what does grace do Grace amen makes you a king to R over sin meaning to live above sin not to grop in your sin and begin claiming Grace no you live above sin it is the grace that makes you live above the world to live above the flesh to R above the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in us just shout it is Christ in me willing and doing of his good pleasure amen yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly blessing in Christ Jesus hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen whenever the devil tries to come every day amen and and try to L strategy to to to steal the Kingdom from us that's why we come together this to recharge Amen to get more strength the weapons of our are notal but they are spiritual pulling down every stronghold praise the name of the Lord who shall L there for any anything to the charge of God if I am an elect of God I am oh my good I am set up to be blameless I am set up to be holy exactly the same as you if you are God is elect amen how many believe that God is elect you believe it right if your God is elect hear this word you are set up to become perfect and blameless and holy that's what he called you that's what he saying that is what he saw and it is a sure word of Prophecy it does not fail so now I want us to look at the word Justified Amen in the message the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom and the Earthly bride says that's always God's judgment when he makes his final judgment when he calls you H he justifies you and he brings you to Redemption did you hear any part like you struggling to do these things the problem we do not subject oursel to the word we don't even make time for the word even when the word is being preach you find people moving out so they don't concentrate under the word it's not you to do anything friends just come and sit under the word amen when when you're out there listen to the word at home listen to the word the word is the one that does the work of course by the power of the Holy Spirit you see he calls you justifies you and brings you to Redemption then his judgment breaks forth upon you and the Holy Ghost and Fire cleanses away the sin Hallelujah he says then you are his glory we can't in the message the rapture we can't we can forgive but not forget I could forgive you but I always remember you done these evil things right you do something and then you apologize I'm sorry I still remember if someone tells you I don't remember they're lying they remembering what you did 20 years ago and some people are very good about talking about what others have done so and so did ABCD so you see they remember and many times those things that we did because we know people remember them then we feel so bad and we feel so sinful and we Feel So Unworthy but let me tell you friends I don't care what anybody remembers about me I care about what God remembers amen you see see because you know before that man you are not [Music] just you are just forgiven but in the sight of God the bride is Justified she never done it in the first place standing there married to the virtual Son of God never seen in the first Place Hallelujah if you ever did anything and he sincerely came and were Justified let me tell you before God he doesn't remember no sin he se you as someone who never sin in the first place why because she was because you was for ordained you was dropped into this sin I was just dropped in there when I came in this flesh I was dropped in there so you got dropped in there that's what he's trying to say here you see but then he says and now when she had the truth and come forth when you had the truth and you come for the blood clean her and you stand there virtuous she know in not seen on her at all not seen on you at all justification means you have never sinned in the first [Music] place Hallelujah let me read another quote so you can get it perfectly un of the bride of Christ but the word Justified is as though you never done it it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and marriage is divorc and debt and it's not even in the memories of God so many of you come before go oh god I've done it again God would say what have you done again this when did you do it before don't remember last year I don't remember I don't remember he says you are Justified there being justified it was accused you was accused you never done it in the first place the old Union is in the sea of forgetfulness for you wasn't married to eat to begin with he the bridegroom before boy you you're ashame the bridegroom boy you're shame the bridegroom Christ boy you asham amen himself for you in your place he took your place for you were predestinated for him you were predestinated for him he chose you in him before the foundation of the world to be in his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seity so how did you come to do this you were deceived into itat by your first [Music] marriage to your adous parents if it is no fault of your own by your natural birth you come after Eve who committed adultery Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who shall deliver me you see that's the reason you was born in adulter an adulter you were a sinner to be that's right you were deceived into it no you ain't it ain't your fault you never did it because that little Jam that was in you was to be you before the foundation of the world God put your name in the Lamb's Book of Life what God what the word seeks to do the word seeks to find those gems those seeds which were chosen in him before the foundation of the world these are the ones he looks at and say shall lay anything anything the charge of God is elect those are the ones he's talking about I don't know about you but I'm one of them hallelujah hallelujah amen every little thing I found myself that I did I was deceived into it brother M it wasn't my fault I've Been Told I never did it in the first place there was a jam of life in me when I heard the word I simply responded I said here I am praise the name of the Lord this is what this world has done for us friends this word has restored us back again this what has Justified us justification means you never did it in the first place stop looking at that thing and presenting it before God each time and many times it becomes an hinderance to your Christian experience why because the devil has kept you glued on this you can remember it the devil can remember it but if it has been confessed correctly God can't remember it he can't remember it at all praise the name of the Lord isn't that amazing friends who shall anything to the charge of God Isiah 50 I'll just read these two verses as I finish it says for the Lord God will help me there shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed Isaiah 57 50:7 can begin from verse 7 he is near that justifieth me who will contend with me let us Stand Together who is my aniversary let him come near to me behold the Lord God will help me who is he that shall condemn me Lo they all shall wax old as an honor as a garet the M shall eat them up [Music] how many enjoyed that verse how many enjoyed those few verses let us read it over again for the Lord God will help me therefore shall I not be confounded therefore have I set my face like a flint and I know that I shall not be ashamed I know I shall not be ashamed hallelujah amen GL God he is near that justifi me he that justified me near me the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want that's what David meant he that justified me is near me David is the same man that killed somebody and St his wife and then he came up and said oh Lord a clean heart within me renew a right Spirit within me take not away your all Spirit David is the same one who who said the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want even though I walk through the valley of I shall not fear no evil because thou thou with me Hallelujah David knew about justification David knew about justification David had boldness the Bible says when we come before God we should come with him with boldness before the throne of grace when you come before Grace you don't come weak and shuted and crying and tearing and fearful you come with boldness why because you know you would not be denied why because you will not be ashamed why because he is near you that justif hallelujah amen when Esther walked before the king us you remember that how many remember that party just go back and read the book of Esther you'll enjoy and you know it was forbidden to walk before the king but Esther came walking amen because she had fasted and she had repented and she had prayed if you've confessed your sins leave them for the blood and go before the throne boldly and as she walked boldly Before the Throne everybody freezed they thought they were going to kill her she's come before the king uninvited but let me tell you friends she had a permanent invitation amen and when she walked there she came with boldness full of grace hallelujah hallelujah I want to be like Esther hallelujah amen when I serve my God I want to serve him with boldness I want to serve him with Grace when I sing I have no condemnation there is therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ who walk not after the flesh but after so when I sing out no condemnation why because he that's justifi is near me and you know the king just raised up the scepter and said here it is and she touched the hallelujah hallelujah and she was accepted and he said what do you say and she said if I found Grace if I found favor before you today please come I have a feast you know you can invite Christ in your life you can invite him in your life everything that you are doing if you know you found favor before Hal hallelujah amen I we finish with Revelation 12:10 and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accus of our Brethren is cast down
