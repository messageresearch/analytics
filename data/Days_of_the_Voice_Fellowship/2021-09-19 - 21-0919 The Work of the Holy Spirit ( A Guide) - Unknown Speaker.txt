you to have your seats for just a moment uh the lord has been good kama de merunji uh yesterday joe by the grace of god we we had a wonderful meeting and uh before i tell you what the outcome was out of the meeting i would like to announce to you that we have a vista in our midst some of you remember the trip we took through about eight months ago can you come and stand with me here again come on up here amen we said god bless you so this is brother martin myself by the police up here for the shame over here we went to that brother brother uh joel now this was the team in a team that went to che guevara again and we had i tell you we had a wonderful time there babu leader 20 children and i should say that the church there is now strong electromagnetic the the pastor there was formerly from the pentecostals and is a man who loves god sergio and we also held a crusade twilio ninja wairu they were meeting at a tree under a tree and [Applause] we went and evangelized around the area chicken and integrated engineering cartoon i don't remember how many people did we baptized about 2007 about 10 someone said to me about ten between five and ten yes so i don't remember the number six but i think we need to stand with them because now they need to do their church construction donated land he donated land yeah and uh this land was his but he donated it to the church and so uh ever since they are believing the lord to provide for the construction of the church and there has not been a message in that area i would like us to remember that so you can be able to stand with them in prayer and also i would like um to say brother joel i don't know if you have sorted it out i'd like to have pastor mogisa for you to greet us brother you would have to unmute i think you can use the micro the camera sound the camera sound can be able to the camera audio can be able to do that so you can greet us and then by the joel you'll be interpreting for him to english i think i think you would need to mute to first remove the audio your source of the the speaker so that it doesn't give an echo can you try now [Music] if you can see him you just have to do it on youtube okay can you try now pasta making some commercial yes we can now hear you go ahead there is an echo i don't know can you mute your speaker can you mute your speaker can you first remove the speaker okay can you speak now okay can you speak now oh my god i was saying praise god resilience and marvel and pastor the chat is called anti-message as pastor has been telling you i thank god when i met the children of god in this place who cannot go that's here and and the love uh and the protection that god has given you come on i turn back the glory and honor god [Music] some of them who are here did not hear but they were here on youtube because we did not have a bigger speaker here but you want to tell us what they could either all right amen we are trying out all this technology here god bless you so much should i remember not you know we do not know when the rapture is happening [Music] we don't want to look at our situation now or our condition and say we cannot do anything for the lord with that amen amen we don't believe in just sitting back and letting others do something whether you are small do something for the lord whether we are two hundred over twenty or just ten overcoming whether we are one family or two families family remember be let's do something for the lord let us not say when i grow up i will serve the lord talking about when you colonize them when our church amen amen we are not building our kingdom so you may need to so i would like to tell you what happened yesterday uh we had a wonderful meeting i see that some of you we are not a part of that meeting because that you were caught up like dr peter you wrote back and told me that you were caught up at work i'd like to appreciate you for doing that wherever is that let us know you are with us and no matter what is going on um we we we we had several people come over and we were a total of 19 people who attended trabajan two hours and most of them were young people but the bible says the bibliogram was despised small beginnings so we therefore believe that it's just the beginning if the the program for our church construction has started integra yoko and just started in a very very strong way attending with young people pledging to do all they can [Music] we had even a young child i think the youngest that was able to pledge something was a five five years old [Music] and she pledged one thousand every month yesterday [Music] [Music] will get food tomorrow no one forced her to ready but she pledged by ourselves 1 000 children sitting every month towards i think should be about 15 13 12. 11 12 11 12 1 and she has been having her books she has been putting a savings there come over central here but she decided when she had on what what was going on she decided that she would break that box [Music] she gave away everything she has yeah what day have you never had enough everything towards the church construction mechanism you don't know what that means someone has been collecting money is one coin by one [Music] for us we shall we shall go and worship up on the mountain whether some remain to to be with their donkeys some are not moving tell them to stay with their donkeys you remember like when god told abraham to go and give his son as an offering abraham knew that to give is to offer before the lord whether he went with his donkeys and when he reached where he was going to go up on the mountain where he will go and offer his son to the lord he told the servants sacrificing his only son was to worship the lord which the lord willing we can use that for attaining land commander is that jesus that is our target we do not get there but to water then we shall get somewhere cut it of the people that were able to give 19 of them a total of about 2.3 are around there [Music] was pledge yes that's the total of all the pledges every month even the pastor from what he said i will give something [Music] this is an opportunity for you to be blessed i tell you all those who have pledged something it is an opportunity and a rare one to serve the lord we also elected the people that will help us [Music] so if brother martin calls you and says please can you remit that money is the mobilizer is mobilizing you organized [Music] and then the others he's already been working as a treasurer so we'll continue with that others may be [Music] god hallelujah amen amen shall we now stand katrina so that we can now prepare ourselves for the world amen i know i've already taken about 47 minutes for the announcement but it was worth it and uh it's the day of the lord still not quran i want you to now not limit god remember give him your time uh just put all the plants aside for now let's take a comment and concentrate on the sauce with all your hearts no more god will speak to you so you can prepare to have you to take a zero now come out with your vehicle family and brother martin's family there everybody and uh my family and the saints mr zoe a two john 16 verse 13. yokan is like two all right i believe everybody is there executives have more to say the name of jesus when he the spirit of truth is calm he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of his of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to amen i mean god bless you you may have your seats come along let's speak to him a moment jesus we consecrate ourselves to you this moment father i am nothing without you that has a signature my brothers are nothing without you naturally and my sisters also never engineers them coming lord they cannot be able to know what it is that you are saying unless you revealed it to them my this morning i'm speaking i'm continuing on our subject we have had on the work of the holy spirit and my subject this morning will be a guide the first two or three services on this topic of the work of the holy spirit i spoke on training of a child now you may realize that training a child some of you may think well what does it have to do with the holy spirit and you will notice that actually a parent a parent physically speaking represents god in the life of a child [Music] and respecting your father and your mother is the first commandment with promise okay that if you respect your parents you are going to receive blessings in it you are going to live long and you will not suffer many people actually physically suffer because they do not represent the holy spirit in a childish life when the children's ability to exercise their free moral agency has not matured well the parent is a parent is there to [Applause] and now we notice that a parent only even nurtures his child until only a certain time in life every at one point in your life to sow spiritual seeds in your life but then come the time [Music] you have outgrown their leadership and you have outgrown their control over your life and you reach a time whereby you are now going to exercise your own spiritual [Music] he was independent i want hallelujah amen then we shall not have so much trouble in the churches i don't even have so much trouble on the pulpit that's why i'm saying that no man has a right to stand on the pulpit to preach the gospel before they are baptized into the holocaust because they still need to sit and beat up [Music] sometimes we can make notes of 10 pages five pages six pages and when i come on the pulpit i only cover a quarter of the first page what is it [Music] youtube and go through every meeting is like three hours of studying hallelujah amen but while we are studying that book you see something was written in there one way yeah when they keep one and he said that there are two identifications of the true church in every generation that is the first church what it will always have the true word of god it's all good must be there hey let me know just come to make you shout thank you that is all good it must be part of you the thing and how can again we got a true prophet and that true prophet is the holy ghost he's a spiritual being god sent the holy ghost to lead the church now of course we have pastors we have a minister to another awareness and the prophet says that the pastor is the highest authority in the church how does he exercise that authority i will [Applause] [Music] right so when sometimes you come to a meeting like this they said service again some people you know we just want to have a we don't want to have a good meal we just want to have a snack for a real good meal today just make present yourself as if you're going to interpret for the whole day yes i mean hallelujah amen don't worry i'll not take you for the whole day just a few minutes amen probably 60 or so but i wanted to yield your time every single day so you see that the holy ghost will teach the word of god again and he will stay with the world and one of things to come what does the holy ghost do remember i told you if you're a child of god you recommend you revolution and you don't have the holy ghost you must receive the holy ghost and if you say what i have not and i can't remember this i will tell you you must take and [Music] [Music] you cannot the trouble we have today you know believers are in the realms of their teachers and tutors refused to graduate no don't go to amen he is the one that was even he is the one that will do it god has provided you a guide and he says god is provided away [Music] amen jesus said i am the way yes i am the way he is say i am the woman he said i am the way you are that way that way which was closed out of the human hallelujah [Applause] amen the what does it say here i want to show you here in the in a quote here in the court leadership leadership please please bear with me and follow follow us education is fine ok are you hearing that education is fine you should go to school and learn more your parents should teach you your mama should teach because the parent is the ultimate teacher of their own children whereby a child goes through home school from grade 1 from kindergarten to grade 12. and then they just go and to journey university if they wish or they can do it online and then someone has graduated and has never gone across the classroom university kids but that won't save you you've got the first one thing but you know life somebody shouted eternal life and there is only one person who can give that to you has to come to jesus christ hallelujah amen oh we are tired of seeing personalities that time is over it's your true idea i said it is over there we want to see jesus hallelujah amen jesus yes hallelujah amen jesus christ oh [Applause] [Music] is the old time holy spirit and that devil won't go near it that's the reason people fear it is good enough for me i mean what is it is that all time holy ghost yo you're you know if you teach a child for one year two years three years for under you never go to another class your teacher can give you an education she can teach you something you have to learn it oh you know you can be ashamed it's important you have to learn it where are we brother where are we truly hallelujah amen your mother can teach you to walk mama quickly you know you go your father can teach you how to be a businessman for what you have to learn that oh or not he gave you it only jesus can give you eternal what what are you going to do now organic here is what you have to do in a connection you have got to accept the person jesus christ you understand that he says all of you when now god to accept the person or you know jesus christ yes christians do have eternal life now but sometimes other leadership gets so much influence on us still we don't know what to do then that time that that the city we don't know what to do when the time comes whereby you're or the next much future christian they say sometimes our leaders have so much influence on us if i should ever influence to reject the be a good boy [Applause] [Applause] amen that's what we are believing to kill that's why we believe this message hallelujah amen but sometimes maybe said hallelujah amen he said but then we've got to accept jesus christ may have truly known his christian jesus alone can do that yes hallelujah i mean he says and though see this young man had achieved all these things in school he lost he says and by his parents and everything they are given the opportunity to back a damn video question you know when you come here do you want him to lead you where can i put him but it's your choice they made you do you want to be baptized in the holy ghost it is not his choice amen you are moved by god himself do what the holy for the church building projects [Music] that that one is very it's not ridiculous myself if you are going to mind about his business [Music] god help us that we will get into the realms where the holocaust can lead us there's a woman in a prayer line and a child was sick what uh a woman hallelujah amen he's bear with me now bear with me it says again now and that one that's one thing that we have in life is to choose you know papa and mama they chose to have a nice little boy and girl like you are my mama [Music] just won't land did you get a's on your report card cardio no no i got very important mother say now you have to study [Music] but you have a choice you can do it or not do it you can say i don't want to see it you have a choice after a while you will have a choice of what girl you are going to marry what paul you're going to marry me you have a choice everywhere in life buddy one more night the consequences are you facing them if you make good choices blessing of it is up to you you will enjoy them someone told me my wife is a son to me my wife is a friend i laughed and kept quiet but i was almost saying but that was your choice [Music] [Music] is do your planting way simply to whether you want to live after this life or just be a good popular person or a movie star or a dancer [Music] is give me a few more minutes some people say so well you just you may even sit there and then all of a sudden you realize you had the holy spirit [Music] yes christopher for me talk about the performer cathy don't get a communication he can't perform while she goes sleeping that's so good to be performed while moving and i want to invite one of you to listen what did he say please bambi and i was telling about the mountain now i think i'm organizing and the ministers another way is that that i've started to embark on is whenever he announces that time is over until she said that she went there what happened would that be brethren seriously massimo [Music] [Music] he had many things he was saying there is about look i don't have time to go through this i probably i will in the coming services but here he was speaking of that which is in the book of revelation chapter 10. where by the it says that when the seventh son has out of their voices the time shall be no more you open your bible quickly together okay let's read verse five and six because of time and the angel which i shall stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that lived forever and ever who created the heaven and the things that are there in our and the earth and the things that they're in our undersea and the things that which are there in that there should be time no longer immediately not [Music] does it mean [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] which is the mysteries contained in bring the [Music] [Music] and he covered them up oh god help us he kept them all off the individual and seal it now remember he said the pyramid is kept by the seven thunder agamemnon everywhere to come if this is the time to say that then the pyramid is kept by the family the church of jesus christ [Applause] all these things from somewhere one see nowhere in the jedi i've got it from the message hallelujah amen in in egypt city that is a pyramid what do you earn it's called the great pyramid of giza bhagita in giza it does not have a cornerstone in two ways and by the bottom and what was the first bible that's the bible that the three wise men that was god's message in the middle which we are close to the days of jesus is it speaks nothing but the fiber which you and i have and you know the bible yes yes it was not kept off the editorial foundation that stone the ginger is the pastor himself is the holy ghost jesus christ of christ hallelujah amen i know the seven thunders has been preached in some way sometime all right hear the message [Music] i don't know if someone is picking a revelation here then he says does the thunders mean that my brethren does the sun does mean that my spirit backhanded he will reveal it it is important to understand that uses the example of the pyramid to explain what is kept off [Music] sanctifications jesus christ foreign [Music] hallelujah all right can i hear
