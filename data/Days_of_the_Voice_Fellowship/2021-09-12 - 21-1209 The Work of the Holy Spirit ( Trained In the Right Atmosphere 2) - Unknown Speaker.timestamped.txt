[57:37] jesus is passing this way this morning
[57:40] do not allow him to bypass you
[57:42] cry like abraham
[57:44] passed without a gentle savior
[57:47] oh hallelujah
[57:49] his presence is here to set us free
[57:52] he's here to commune with us
[57:54] because he calls us that calm and reason
[57:57] together
[57:58] do our sins be like scarlet
[58:00] maybe things have gone exactly the
[58:02] course of this week
[58:03] but jesus is here to fix everything
[58:06] he can fix your soul problem
[58:09] he can speak he can fix your spiritual
[58:11] problem this morning

[58:47] and everything shuts up
[58:50] there is a voice in the blood of jesus
[58:52] the verse of the blood is speaking this

[1:26:09] [Music]
[1:26:18] the work of the holy spirit is the
[1:26:23] subject or title that i'm looking at but
[1:26:25] i'm speaking on trained in the right
[1:26:28] atmosphere
[1:26:34] truthful trained in the right atmosphere
[1:26:39] amen you may have your streets
[1:26:43] now
[1:26:44] on sunday
[1:26:46] sunday we spoke about we also read john
[1:26:49] 16 that speaks about the spirit of truth
[1:26:51] when he comes to us
[1:26:56] and he says he will guide you into all
[1:26:58] truth
[1:27:01] now
[1:27:14] and then in galatians paul said that the
[1:27:16] law was our school master to bring us to
[1:27:19] christ
[1:27:25] we might be justified by faith
[1:27:29] now that faith has come
[1:27:44] is alive just like you are
[1:27:47] someone can i hold your mother but you
[1:27:48] have outgrown the school masters
[1:27:54] therefore you no longer need the school
[1:27:56] man
[1:27:58] when you come to the knowledge of jesus
[1:28:01] christ
[1:28:03] it does not mean that if you have
[1:28:05] received faith the law is no longer in
[1:28:08] existence
[1:28:27] now when a child is still young come on
[1:28:29] charity that child is given instruction
[1:28:32] oh i know you're awake baby that guilt
[1:28:34] that child is is told what to do oh man
[1:28:37] would you actually know
[1:28:39] and until a time when that child has
[1:28:42] grown
[1:28:44] up
[1:28:45] when they reach what we call the age of
[1:28:47] accountability
[1:28:50] that child is no longer instructed
[1:28:54] just like
[1:29:09] that she told me how to do well let me
[1:29:11] tell you guys until you're never young
[1:29:13] it is
[1:29:14] easy and now i am doing them without
[1:29:16] having her to tell me what to do
[1:29:21] but if she did not tell me what to do
[1:29:23] when i was young
[1:29:24] [Music]
[1:29:28] there are certain things you cannot
[1:29:29] learn even when you were a grown-up why
[1:29:32] do we have the intuitive mood that you
[1:29:33] showed a big and
[1:29:35] you can only learn them when you were
[1:29:37] young
[1:29:40] in our language in uganda we have
[1:29:42] a saying that
[1:29:44] you know when a tree is old so
[1:29:46] old i don't know
[1:29:52] here that something which grew up when
[1:29:54] it is already crooked when you try to
[1:29:56] make it right it will just break up so
[1:29:58] you see when a child is still young or
[1:30:01] whenever
[1:30:02] you have a chance
[1:30:04] you have an opportunity
[1:30:07] to have them shaped in the way you want
[1:30:10] them to grow
[1:30:14] for them but when they grow up
[1:30:16] you no longer have that opportunity
[1:30:25] amen he is now using that opportunity
[1:30:28] when we are still young
[1:30:32] when we are still young
[1:30:45] some of you have just believed recently
[1:30:49] if you don't get changed now they will
[1:30:51] catch you
[1:30:52] you may never change
[1:30:55] you have recently been baptized
[1:30:58] if you don't change now
[1:31:00] you
[1:31:05] [Applause]
[1:32:23] there was a wave that came some years
[1:32:25] ago
[1:32:28] and it went all over the world
[1:32:30] and many people left the message
[1:32:34] including pastors
[1:32:36] who could stand and say i preached the
[1:32:38] message for 40 years for 30 years
[1:32:44] i found out it is not the truth
[1:32:47] what is the problem
[1:32:49] was the training
[1:32:52] they never experienced the god of this
[1:32:54] message
[1:32:58] let me tell you my brother my sister
[1:33:01] if you have no testimony
[1:33:04] of the experience of the lord
[1:33:34] is
[1:33:47] because you have received a good
[1:33:49] training
[1:33:52] hallelujah amen there is no use of
[1:33:54] preaching the holy ghost
[1:33:58] who are people who are never trained
[1:34:02] and i will prove that to you by the
[1:34:03] messages
[1:34:07] if i come in the morning
[1:34:10] and i tell you receive the holy ghost
[1:34:15] but you don't know you've not been
[1:34:16] trained
[1:34:50] [Music]
[1:34:58] you cannot receive
[1:35:21] [Applause]
[1:35:56] and often times when we have two or
[1:35:59] different families whereby there is one
[1:36:01] family of our parents trying to train
[1:36:03] their children
[1:36:08] in the cabinet these children will see
[1:36:12] children from another family who have
[1:36:14] more freedom to do what they want to do
[1:36:16] when they want to do it and they will
[1:36:18] often feel as though for them they're in
[1:36:20] a prison house
[1:36:30] [Applause]
[1:36:38] and the parents of the other house will
[1:36:40] say well the parents of that house are
[1:36:42] legalistic
[1:36:48] they always
[1:36:49] constrain their children
[1:36:52] but let me tell you they can't be father
[1:36:54] or mother
[1:36:55] you only have one chance
[1:37:00] when they reach their age of
[1:37:02] accountability
[1:37:20] [Music]
[1:37:24] when someone now of course as i'm
[1:37:26] speaking about a physical child and a
[1:37:27] physical mother i wanted to look at a
[1:37:29] spiritual child and a spiritual mother
[1:37:32] come on
[1:37:37] so we see that there is also a physical
[1:37:39] child which is a spiritual child which
[1:37:41] is now the church
[1:37:42] [Music]
[1:37:45] and we see that it's a physical mother
[1:37:47] which is the church
[1:37:51] the believers are accurate these are the
[1:37:52] physical children
[1:37:54] children rather than
[1:37:55] you and the child and the mother
[1:37:58] he's the church now
[1:37:59] hallelujah amen the the the the place
[1:38:02] where we go
[1:38:05] where is that of course god is the
[1:38:07] mother also yeah the bible calls him the
[1:38:09] blessed one
[1:38:11] of the bible
[1:38:14] where we suck
[1:38:28] he's
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:38] now
[1:39:39] i want i want us to look at parenting
[1:39:41] according to scripture
[1:39:48] remember this is supposed to be typed
[1:39:50] spiritually

[1:40:02] my aim is to show you the spiritual but
[1:40:05] i speak the physical typing the
[1:40:08] spiritual give me hebrews 12 11.
[1:40:13] i read about about you don't need to go
[1:40:15] there because i'm going to read about
[1:40:16] first scriptures very quickly hebrews 12
[1:40:19] 11 says now not just a name for the
[1:40:21] present simmons to be joyous
[1:40:27] but grievous nevertheless afterwards it
[1:40:30] yielded the peaceable fruit of
[1:40:32] righteousness and to them which are
[1:40:35] exercised thereby
[1:40:38] yes
[1:40:46] oh
[1:40:48] [Music]
[1:41:00] [Music]
[1:41:11] [Music]
[1:41:21] [Music]
[1:41:33] [Music]
[1:41:34] until you leave the
[1:41:36] service and say how could pastor speak
[1:41:37] to me like that oh he's a nuke fool my
[1:41:39] music
[1:41:42] is he the one supposed to tell me what
[1:41:43] to do oh yeah you know kum
[1:42:18] [Music]
[1:42:26] but the bible is telling us when you
[1:42:28] were testing bible yet
[1:42:31] when you are corrected
[1:42:33] it does not seem to be joyous say listen
[1:42:36] but it seems to be grievous
[1:42:39] amen this bible this word of god is this
[1:42:42] message of the hour is given to us to
[1:42:44] correct us
[1:42:44] [Music]
[1:42:48] hallelujah amen do you remember the road
[1:42:51] which moses went with to egypt
[1:43:13] [Music]
[1:43:21] these men you know seem to also try to
[1:43:23] to have a display of power because you
[1:43:25] never said that
[1:43:28] a display of authority you have all
[1:43:30] these troubles but more than showed them
[1:43:34] a higher display of authority and power
[1:43:37] yeah i already know a man you know we
[1:43:39] use the rich
[1:43:41] which he held
[1:43:43] even because that road was given him by
[1:43:45] god himself
[1:43:49] and he told him put it under your
[1:43:50] armpits
[1:43:53] [Music]
[1:44:05] and uh it was a road again a good damn
[1:44:10] now let me tell you
[1:44:11] when he threw it down
[1:44:13] and when he breaks it down good job
[1:44:15] that's process of throwing it down and
[1:44:16] picking it up
[1:44:26] he
[1:45:28] doubted it
[1:45:30] and his son died what happened
[1:45:32] don't doubt this message
[1:45:34] because this message is the highest
[1:45:36] revelation in the land now come on
[1:45:41] this is a lot of power
[1:45:53] but afterwards
[1:45:55] you could use the peaceable fruit of
[1:45:57] righteousness
[1:46:00] unto them which are exercised thereby
[1:46:05] exercised
[1:46:10] i believe
[1:46:11] [Music]
[1:46:24] do you think we are doing
[1:46:40] [Music]
[1:46:52] what is the holy
[1:47:14] from faith to faith
