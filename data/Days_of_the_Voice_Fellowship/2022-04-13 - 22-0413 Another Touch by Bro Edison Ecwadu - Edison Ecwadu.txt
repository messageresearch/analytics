[Music] and he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town and when he had spit on his eyes and put his hands upon him he asked him if he's so old and he looked up and said i see men as trees walking after that he put his eyes he put his hands again upon his eyes and made him look up and he was restored and he saw every man clearly [Music] pray you may be seated in the presence of the lord i must say this uh maybe before i start a senator may ah you people are falling victims of my love but praise the lord amen regardless of the distance i thank him so much for giving me this opportunity that i stand and speak to you it's something that the lord has put in my heart praise the lord come here now from where we've read one way too much [Music] he took jesus to lead us one by one take you by hand and lead you outside of the world praise the lord man when he led you outside of the world well yeah praise the lord man he brought you to salvation that was the first touch that he gave you because we were blind we were under the masses of jesus christ and it took obedience for us to obey we have not obeyed that we are not accepted to follow christ christ will not have anything to do with you and me nature why because he cannot deal with you in the world pick [Music] now let's think like this second floor is the recipe if that blind man oh mercedes whom jesus led uh outside of the town yes because he was not seeing jesus in the first place because he was blind but somebody was holding his name and he was walking by faith he didn't even tell him where he was taking it praise the lord tonight if this man had rejected jesus later praise the lord amen if he had insisted not to god see again if he had lost trust for jesus christ he said jesus do you think he would have gained decided you need amen you cannot discover the purpose of god in your life if you don't have a revelation for following him hallelujah christ demands obedience regardless things may not make sense in the beginning you may not understand the way things are going on in your life now but i'm here to tell you my sister my brothers one day things will make sense one day you will understand why things are going on in your life and the bible tells now that and refuse the call of jesus he knew this man was not actually seeing well emmanuel trump said you know he was not saying clearly because how do you see a man like a tree walking double chairman right now you see the trees as what can i tell you if you're seeing and that is the way we saw when we just came to salvation we were seeing men like trees walking so many things never made sense to you deep inside your heart your heart was [Applause] but you could not get satisfied with the world you knew something was wrong somewhere oh man you are the world where you are about anyhow you could not help yourself you didn't know what to do again you didn't know which path to take how many you covered oh my you were blind by faith you came as a catholic no you came out of that present protestant church you came out of the ph and you walked anyhow no america you didn't know where you were going you didn't know where you were going the leadership of god that he followed praise the lord amen he brought you in jesus hallelujah amen why don't we thank god he has opened your eyes why don't you tell what this evening that is peace on your eyes the spirit of christ is a blessing praise the lord it's a blessing when he brought you here he spit on your eyes with they were supposed to be in your heart you knew this is home moment you understood that this is where i belong when you're not paid praise the lord amen that was the spirit of the lord jesus it was a blessing to you brother [Music] leading you can see something better than the denomination it is not because you are better than them no by seeing god it is not because you are wonderful anything good no since your guaranteed children it is by the grace of god sisters of all those people that were out there brother and troubled he decided to grab your heart and then he led you outside of the world why did he forsake the rest of the body and then he picked you in particular one day the disciples you tell us the meaning of the parable jesus said yesterday oh i love this one listen to this he said to you the meaning of the parable is given that you may believe praise the lord amen i want to tell you this there are people who are protested i want you to accept that there are those people no idea that he knew jesus looked at him and had compassion on him and i'm quite rich he saw this man was blind he didn't know that was god he never needed that pool anymore he needed god now charity to allah praise the lord why did he abandon all those people praise the lord amen if your heart agrees with this truth if your heart has accepted you to believe this message that is the proof that my brother my sister he you've gone crazy according to the word you don't need someone to convince you to believe the word you are programmed to believe the word that is how god designed you in the beginning you are designed for that purpose therefore you can't seek to find that you are in the divine purpose i mean and because you see better than what they see i want to tell you brother sisters they may not understand you don't convince them to understand it praise the lord amen what matters is that god understands you know praise the lord i mean it doesn't matter what everyone says season the teacher they may talk about you they may insult you find your command i want to tell as long as you know you're on a solid crown man all other crowns are sinking inside hey praise the lord i mean you are on that solid ground hallelujah jesus asked peter yesterday the disciples [Music] [Music] for the first time you have never read that scripture you've never heard it being read don't you worry about they are reading it for the first time because christ is in you one a christian the one who is the one now get to the monash bench knee go down on your knees and pray for camilla pray to the owner of life and he may give you another touch

about leaving one spot and going to another tobacco overnight it's about abandoning one state of life and beginning to live a new life praise the lord that is what is demanding foreign are you going
