TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] oh [Music] i know [Music] oh [Music] for me [Music] [Music] ah [Music] oh okay so we check our reading from matthew chapter 13. next summer and we're reading from verse 24. another parabol put him forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which sold good seed in his field but while men slept his enemy came and saw tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blood was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the servants of the householder came and said unto him sir it is thou it is not thou sow good seed in thy field from whence then has it tears he said unto them an enemy has done this the servants said unto him will do thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while you gather up the tears you root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the harvest and in the time of the harvest i will say to the reapers gather ye together fast their tears and bind them in bundles to burn them but gather the wheat into my ban mateo is [Music] [Music] foreign i uh to share on the time of manifestation each of you that are here this evening amen and so we at the time we are living at a time truly movie say that and the message i'm going to share is deeply in my heart and i hope that the lord somehow spiritually will put you on my brother's heart to take [Music] is the usual word of prophets which we have received in our time we are living at a time of manifestation truly right we quicker the world is trying to unite you know when you see the united world council of churches that one brother prophesied that it would be before it was yes make east african union communities if you notice the passports we are now getting the new passports the blue passports they they have east african they are east african community possible uganda east africa whereby you will not be recognized as a citizen of uganda alone but you'll be recognized as a citizen of uganda kenya tanzania sudan and rwanda uganda kenya tanzania and there is also european union and um also there is many unions everywhere trade unions i will now break that down so why this has never been before but it is happening in this generation why would that be two several more because this is the generation that is winding up the life and the human life and the world as we know it so there will be a a an international community one with a world government one world government and one world religion and now i realize that that is where it is headed off but but by the time it gets to that now again the rapture will already have happened and the bride of jesus christ will already have gone in the rapture in heaven because remember by the time the persecutions begin to happen on this earth hallelujah amen by the time we see the persecutions happening on the earth the bride will not be here that will be the great tribulation [Music] all over the world from every nation on earth somehow within their heart they are longing for home they are longing for where we are where we are going not for [Music] we are also at this time which is supposed to be the time of manifestation because every spirit you may have a lot of debates about what is in the soil and you may beat two people or three people four people oh what is the power and the soul may tell them that i planted maize from a season here oh [Music] until it brings forth of its kind [Music] and so he said that the kingdom of heaven is unto a man that went to sausage against but while men slept it is jesus yes he is the one who is the owner of but that is when the devil came and began to sow wrong seed i was sitting where i injured in a nasty and seeking charm the wrong teachings indicating the wrong ideologies wrong understanding things which cannot be established by the word of god that's when you find men preaching baptism of babies that's where you found teachings like purgatory however that's when you find teachings like uh uh presidents i would assume [Music] into independent things that the apostles never [Music] and when the blood was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared also when men were sleeping but when the blood was sprung up [Music] the servants of the householder they saw it the [Music] there is nothing that happens in your life without god knowing the where was god when the enemy was planting the tears [Music] [Music] yes he knows the end from the beginning and he has everything figured out [Music] it's like someone coming to steal something from your house in the night when you're watching them on camera look at this one look at him and then he watched him no more do you know because you know you cannot do much much damage and you know you have everything figured out because when you watch a thief in not being discovered if a thief comes in your house in the night or people are indeed a mature people and you you shout you wake up and you shout at him and he tries to open your door even if you don't just speak i can see you never [Applause] [Music] the disciples [Applause] but he thought everybody was sleeping not always unto you but actually when he awoke the disciples when they awoke the servants he knows all things head into your nerve and so he cares so good city do i see my unknown he was just answering them of course we did okay [Music] he said until the time is worked worked in the first hour he will have those who will work in the last hour we are the ones working in this last [Applause] but now you can rest [Music] graham ominously billy graham and we know that these were sent out to bind up the tears [Music] he said buying them up in bandus abandoned [Music] this is the time of manifestation jesus wanted to wait until this time yes there would be no more hypocrisy i request foreign you can see it with your naked eyes every seed in the time of the harvest would be bringing forth of its kind just like his words saying in the book of genesis must be made the seed of god will manifest themselves and the seed of the devil will also manifest [Music] [Music] there's something i want to show you here why don't you change praise the name of the lord and he also talks about the children of god being manifested hallelujah read first john chapter 3. it's okay let no man deceive you he that doeth righteousness is righteous even as he is righteous he that committed sin is of the devil for the devil sinners from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil whosoever is born of god does not commit sin for his seed remains in him and he cannot sin because he's born of god in this the children of god are manifest and the children of the devil whosoever that do with not righteousness is not of god neither he that loveth not his brother anger [Music] [Music] [Music] way oh only those who that we should love one another not as cain who was of that wicked one and slew his brother and when i first leave him because his own works were evil and his brother's right yes [Music] did not love [Music] that is why we also help one another [Music] foreign if you tried to pretend that you are a christian will betray you your true identity will be betrayed it can [Applause] [Music] manifest is time what do they require i'm asking you now what does the seed require to grow yes somebody come on in [Music] oh water and water sun sunlight some some are telling me oxygen but it is it it is sunlight in secretary and rain water namaste water rain two things sun light um sonogram juba and rain nincuba and these are the same things everything innovating that the spiritual seeds also need to grow are you listening to me my name is are you listening to me church i'm pretty happy two things but in this case it is not sunlight but it is sunlight amen it is not s-u-n light it is s-o-n [Music] [Applause] him but when he came who was he he was the light of the world amen and then what else do we need they [Applause] [Music] yes so you know what i'm talking about that rain that comes in when you're just planting another train that comes in when you are about to invest [Music] deep some may not understand but you you bought it well now listen what did he say this is the most interesting part okay and i'm glad you're listening one thing that happens and then the holocaust but these seeds what were they in sequence you know that were planted in this field exactly the good [Applause] but in the same way [Applause] [Applause] just they may act the same way the pentecostal shout out speak in tongues we should shout and speak english [Music] and i would believe that when they are when the anointing comes more than men and so women even are better speakers do you know god does not take away the those things are good must be a part of the truth you cannot replace the word there is foreign we believe in the manifestation of that word you believe in that manifestation of the word now the same word but it would only provide the atmosphere why would i take away and i believe i was predestinated i'm sorry i can't speak for anyone here for myself if you can speak for yourself can you just speak it out [Applause] praise the name of the lord amen that's why we must no [Applause] amen only went and sold [Music] [Music] here [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] no matter what amen it was a [Applause] where would you begin to manifest your true oh you cannot find peace in the things of the world amen why because your heart is if [Music] because i'm not happy for the suffering i went through i believe that they would understand them come on acts together anymore even if the ship deserves to do that it is sister hallelujah amen now i want to read the quotes [Music] from one message and i will actually finish with it uh that would be from the audition church agency the second thought that must be impressed on our hearts is the that the seven church edges started out with the antichrist spiritually it started as well as the holy spirit who is blessed who is to be blessed forever [Music] spirits whether they are of god because many false prophets are going out into the world many false prophets what talk about that can't show any false prophets and sometimes you think that prophets are only preachers prophets false prophets are those with wrong spirits on them and we shall the ages came in with false prophets and they will go out with first prophets [Music] [Applause] now of course there is going to be a real false prophet one like this in the grand sense of the man mentioned in the revelations shall say unto you lord hear his christ so there believe it not for that shall arise for christ and false prophets and show signs great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive their very elect by the way have you seen that some people preach that the bride the elect will be deceived [Music] is [Music] it is [Music] jesus said if we are possible but i'm glad it is not possible oh my is in the second chambers believe it or not [Music] you come and see the great prophets [Applause] [Music] there we are false prophets also among the people even as there shall be frustrations among you meaning in the christian do you know why people follow them they don't need children people follow them because they have very big followings like this one because everybody's going there for me and in this there was one which had like one car which land should we go to get okay he said go to this one because it has many cars because it means that it is the one which is the worse so when we used it can we we got stuck there for a very long time and when we reached ahead we tried to commence we noticed there was many cars on that lane because the road was having a problem in front dragon the chisel my father's religion yeah but the children of god i never explained when you go through the narrow ways if you have a big head go through it it hallelujah [Music] then we continue here quickly with that quote i want to finish with that quote he says but there will be many false prophets he says among you who privily shall bring in damnable heresies even denying the lord that brought them and bring upon themselves with destruction [Music] how will they deny the law they will refuse water baptism in the name of allah or jesus the other day i called i was with one of the young man he's coming to this church these days his name is joanne what i told him now read acts [Music] shall receive the gift of the [Music] hallelujah i mean that's what the bible says but these false prophets are anointed but to tell lies that's a doctrine of [Music] it's up to you to start will you stand with the word or you will [Music] [Music] [Music] because they can't help it [Applause] thank you for watching where are the kundalini is they shall turn away their ears from the truth and they shall be turned out of fables this scripture [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] and you want to go to you want to you are bribing god to get you a white man oh my let me read a little more a little more on this same quote i'm not reading another chord just this one it says now in every case you will you will notice that a false prophet is one who is outside the world just as we showed you that antichrist means anti-word oh [Music] give it giving it a meaning that fits their own devilish have you ever noticed how the people who lead others astray bind them closely to themselves by fear malimuta [Music] is is [Music] will always lead one to the word and by the people to jesus christ and he won't tell the people to fear him or what he says but to fear what the word says that is why you see many of the churches in this with his [Music] notice how these people like judas are out for money they get you to sell all you have listen to me i'm about to finish that they get to make you sell all that you have and give it to them and their schemes together schemes they spend more time on offerings [Music] foreign the money can speak about the offering by the end of the service you even pay your transport yes [Music] they spent too much [Music] will make use of a gift which has imagine of error in it and then ask for money but call it out another one i watched one on on the in uganda here you're not going another one of you guys called someone i never had to speak think now you could have been and when he reached somewhere i never talked is that true the truth the woman said that's an them and they go back all right okay where was i brother can you highlight that for me okay those they spend money okay right and the people will go to them and bear with them and support them and believe them not knowing it is the way of death yes the land is full of cannon impersonators in the last day they will try to imitate that prophet messenger we have a last [Music] hallelujah praise the name of the lord come here you can put that off brother man i want to finish with this is the nation to say when brother banham came on the scene in the 1940s some of you have not watched that you need to go on youtube and uh search call the deep college through the deep william runner youtube deep college to the deep william branham yes you will notice he someone is

have come for someone else and one day people say it dragon william brother william branham is doing what they call mental telepathy and uh one day when the spirit of the lord came down to telepathy [Music] without looking that was god oh yeah our generation indicating a prophet [Music] that would bring forth the restoration of the world god was manifested [Music] [Music] i see this is a church
