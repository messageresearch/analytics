[1:04:36] suggestion the doctor since yesterday
[1:04:38] they saying that they are preferring
[1:04:41] that maybe they would
[1:04:43] do she she would maybe go under
[1:04:46] operation okay it's not clear because
[1:04:50] according to what the brother say like
[1:04:52] you know nowadays they you know how the

[1:04:59] will of God butam says God heals through
[1:05:01] Operation God heals through uh through
[1:05:04] medicine through music and so we let us

[1:05:40] the way we fight our battles we don't
[1:05:42] fight physically because the Bible says
[1:05:45] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:05:50] but we are fighting against spiritual
[1:05:52] amen we are fighting against spirit
[1:05:56] that's why the Bible tells us uh that a
[1:05:59] caral person is enemity to God because
[1:06:03] God is spirit and those who worship God
[1:06:06] they must worship Him in spirit blessed
[1:06:08] be the name of the Lord and the reason
[1:06:10] asked why God want us to worship Him in
[1:06:12] spirit because we are fighting against
[1:06:15] spirit amen and if you are caral you're
[1:06:19] not going to fight you are going to lose
[1:06:21] the battle because you are fighting
[1:06:23] against invisible forces
[1:06:27] praise be to God Amen and we shall see
[1:06:30] some examples in the Bible and we shall
[1:06:33] look at the
[1:06:34] disciples and some few few examples
[1:06:37] blessed be the name of the Lord amen and
[1:06:41] where we have read in uh in Ephesians we
[1:06:44] are seeing Ephesians chapter 6 from vers
[1:06:47] 12 it says that for we wrestle not
[1:06:49] against flesh and blood but against
[1:06:52] principalities amen against the
[1:06:56] powers and against the rulers of
[1:06:59] Darkness

[1:07:15] in high places praise be to God There
[1:07:20] Are Spiritual wickedness that rules in
[1:07:23] higher places
[1:07:25] and that's why Apostle Paul is reminding
[1:07:28] us that we are not wrestling against
[1:07:30] blood and flesh every time when we are
[1:07:33] fighting battles we should look Beyond
[1:07:36] blood and flesh amen praise be to God in

[1:14:12] the whole word we don't take quarter
[1:14:15] word amen we follow the right
[1:14:19] prescription praise be to God Amen he

[1:14:34] take the whole armor of God church we
[1:14:36] are going to be able to withstand this
[1:14:39] evil

[1:14:44] we are not going to be able the
[1:14:47] Pentecostal have taken the quarter
[1:14:50] armor and that's why the devil has
[1:14:52] stripped them
[1:14:54] naked the religion the Catholics they
[1:14:56] have
[1:14:57] taken the atom I think just a little
[1:15:01] adult
[1:15:02] armor that's why they go they study for
[1:15:06] seven good years to become a priest then
[1:15:10] when they come in the service they end
[1:15:12] up baptizing
[1:15:15] babies seven years in the

[1:15:46] got about with truth blessed be the name
[1:15:49] of the Lord even message believers who
[1:15:52] take quarter
[1:15:53] armor they the one who runs with false
[1:15:57] doctrines with
[1:15:59] polygamist but the Bible tells us to
[1:16:01] take the whole armor of
[1:16:04] God because without the whole armor of
[1:16:07] God you cannot be able to withstand this
[1:16:09] evil day we are living the perious time
[1:16:13] amen where is only the S is in the word
[1:16:17] praise be to God that's why the holy
[1:16:20] spirit says we should take the whole
[1:16:21] armor of God to be able to Wi this
[1:16:25] stand praise the Lord so my brother my
[1:16:30] sister I also advise you to take the

[1:16:35] God praise the
[1:16:38] Lord bam tells
[1:16:41] us the devil does not fear our
[1:16:44] shouting the devil knows very well that
[1:16:48] the armor of the Christian is the word
[1:16:49] of
[1:16:52] God just this afternoon one brother was
[1:16:55] showing me a clip where one of the
[1:16:58] pastor was praying the
[1:17:00] congregation and I was I was telling
[1:17:02] that maybe they realized
[1:17:07] that because this man was he was moving
[1:17:11] the congregations praying one by
[1:17:15] one
[1:17:17] why not even a
[1:17:22] quarter there is nowhere in scriptures
[1:17:26] where the Bible says you spray
[1:17:30] Believers
[1:17:33] amen it is the work of the Holy Ghost to
[1:17:36] spread the church with the
[1:17:38] word amen not going and buying you over
[1:17:43] what and you start praying
[1:17:45] people but because the Bible say because
[1:17:48] they rejected the
[1:17:50] truth that's why God has given them to
[1:17:54] that spirit to accept lie and perish
[1:17:56] with it praise be to
[1:17:59] God and it's going to continue like that
[1:18:02] we get worse and worse and worse because
[1:18:06] we are living in the Harvest Time praise
[1:18:09] be to God the life is back in the
[1:18:13] seed praise the Lord and every time we
[1:18:15] come in the presence of God like this we
[1:18:18] have come in the presence of the son to
[1:18:20] be ripened by the
[1:18:23] word and we get rened by through prayer
[1:18:27] and eating on the word praise be to God
[1:18:31] Amen stand there having your land G
[1:18:34] apart with truth and having on your
[1:18:37] breastplate of righteousness and your
[1:18:39] feet shed with preparation of the gospel
[1:18:42] of peace above all taking the shield of
[1:18:47] faith without faith it is impossible to
[1:18:51] please God so you must take the bu of
[1:18:56] Faith you have come here believing that
[1:18:59] all whatever you have come to ask for it
[1:19:02] is going to be answered amen when I came
[1:19:06] here this afternoon I prayed and
[1:19:09] believed God that my wife is going to
[1:19:12] deliver and thanks be to God just
[1:19:14] shortly after that prayer and your
[1:19:17] prayers I was told as I was not even
[1:19:20] there praise be to God but God has been
[1:19:24] faithful
[1:19:26] there is a a sister Wanga is helping her
[1:19:28] don't say that hey brother now you're
[1:19:30] here preaching and she's there alone no
[1:19:32] praise the Lord but I have to come and
[1:19:36] stand in the father's business because
[1:19:40] when Jesus had as Lazarus had died he
[1:19:43] moved for another more
[1:19:47] days because he was in the will of the
[1:19:50] father and because I was in the will of
[1:19:53] the Father God did his
[1:19:55] part amen praise be to God so without
[1:20:01] faith it's impossible to please God
[1:20:03] Brethren if there's a time that we have
[1:20:05] to pray now is the
[1:20:07] time there is a lot of forces fighting
[1:20:10] against the church fighting against
[1:20:14] families
[1:20:16] amen so now is the time for us to arise
[1:20:20] and
[1:20:21] stand it's our time to pray it's our
[1:20:25] time to seek the Holy Ghost amen it's
[1:20:27] our time to be
[1:20:29] desperate you better be desperate now or
[1:20:32] you will never be desperate praise be to
[1:20:37] God you cannot fight unless you are
[1:20:41] desperate the country cannot fight
[1:20:43] unless they are desperate for Liberation
[1:20:46] praise be to God the children of Israel
[1:20:49] they had to pray until one day God met
[1:20:52] Moses and told him I am heard the Cry of
[1:20:56] my
[1:20:57] children they had cried for so long
[1:21:00] every single day the more they were oper
[1:21:04] oppressed the more they became desperate
[1:21:06] for
[1:21:08] deliverance praise be to God remember
[1:21:12] sometime we talk about the soul
[1:21:14] travail the bible say that when Zion
[1:21:16] travailed then she gave birth amen there
[1:21:20] must be a travail for a baby to be born
[1:21:24] there must be a desperation for a
[1:21:27] Believer to be serious you must be
[1:21:30] desperate for
[1:21:32] God
[1:21:33] [Applause]
[1:21:35] Amen and Bam says that if you're not
[1:21:38] worthy to die you are not worthy to
[1:21:44] live so if you
[1:21:52] think brother sister you better get
[1:21:54] desperate
[1:21:56] now because it's later than we
[1:22:01] think
[1:22:06] amen but what I'm saying the message
[1:22:08] honestly contending for the faith that
[1:22:11] was once delivered to the Saint it says
[1:22:13] that what you need is an oldfashioned
[1:22:17] upper room with a prayer meeting where
[1:22:21] you breay down the power of God
[1:22:25] amen that is what we need
[1:22:29] tonight we need old fashioned upper room
[1:22:33] with a prayer meeting where you pray
[1:22:36] down the power of God not saying prayer
[1:22:40] you're going to
[1:22:44] sleep
[1:22:46] Hallelujah it may all in fact not only
[1:22:49] at night but we have to be we have to
[1:22:53] pray up
[1:22:54] there is what they call prayer walk
[1:22:57] sometime
[1:22:58] you you are walking from here to start
[1:23:02] praying
[1:23:04] amen you are going to Cha you are going
[1:23:07] to track to Cha Brother start
[1:23:12] praying praise be to God because it is
[1:23:15] later than we
[1:23:17] think Daniel tells us that when he saw
[1:23:20] that the 70 years was getting closer he
[1:23:24] went in prayer and
[1:23:26] fasting and
[1:23:28] supplication praise be to God we are
[1:23:31] expecting for the rapture we are waiting
[1:23:34] for the Rapture amen and our pastor told
[1:23:37] the Rapture started many years it
[1:23:39] started a long time ago amen we are in
[1:23:42] Rapture process are you in that
[1:23:46] process do you feel
[1:23:51] rupture praise the Lord
[1:23:59] sometime you walk you feel like is just
[1:24:02] over

[1:26:35] Faith where you shall be able to quench
[1:26:38] all the F deaths DS of the
[1:26:42] wicked and take the element of Salvation
[1:26:45] And The Sword of the spirit which is the
[1:26:48] word amen The
[1:26:51] Shield which is Faith and the sword
[1:26:55] which is the word amen when we go in
[1:26:58] prayer we approach the Devil with a
[1:27:01] shield of faith in the sword of the word
[1:27:04] it is written This one belongs to me it
[1:27:06] is written amen that devil give way this
[1:27:10] is mine praise be to
[1:27:12] God and I'm tells us that we have to
[1:27:15] fight for every inch of our
[1:27:19] promise indeed it is given to
[1:27:22] us and real in the works of children of
[1:27:25] Israel some other parts the journey was
[1:27:28] was flowing it was okay but in some
[1:27:31] areas it was serious fighting blessed be
[1:27:35] the name of the Lord there are some
[1:27:37] tribe that say that we shall not let
[1:27:40] them go we are going to oppose them and
[1:27:43] that's what happens even in the
[1:27:46] spiritual blessed be the name of the
[1:27:49] Lord
[1:27:50] but we are more than Overcomers
[1:27:54] Jesus gives us
[1:27:56] Victory whatever you ask the father in
[1:27:59] my name I will do it that the father may
[1:28:03] be glorified into the son
[1:28:06] amen whatever we ask in the name praise
[1:28:11] be to God that is the Revelation which
[1:28:13] David had the so they were just fighting
[1:28:16] the battle but there came a young man in
[1:28:19] the camp who are the Revelation in the
[1:28:21] name praise be to God and when he faces
[1:28:25] Goliath he told him I have come in the
[1:28:28] name of the Lord praise be to God David
[1:28:32] had a secret in the
[1:28:34] name and we approach the devil in the
[1:28:37] name not in the name of katas him not in
[1:28:41] the name of the mother church not in the
[1:28:43] name of the Holy Mary but in the name of
[1:28:45] the Lord Jesus Christ the devil will
[1:28:48] have to give
[1:28:50] way praise be to God but what I'm saying
[1:28:54] that when the name of Jesus was first
[1:28:57] mentioned a dead baby in the womb jumped
[1:29:03] amen hallelujah and we here to tell the
[1:29:06] devil that we have come tonight to face
[1:29:09] you in the name of the Lord Jesus every
[1:29:12] situation every condition every
[1:29:14] wickedness will have to give way in the
[1:29:17] name of Jesus do you believe that amen
[1:29:22] and that's why the prophet says
[1:29:25] with a prayer meeting where you pray
[1:29:28] down the power of God do you know that
[1:29:30] you can pray down the power of
[1:29:32] God and that's why we are
[1:29:35] here we have come to call on the power
[1:29:38] of
[1:29:40] God in 2 Corinthians chapter 10: 6 says
[1:29:44] then having in Readiness to Revenge all
[1:29:49] Disobedience amen
[1:29:57] praise be to God there is something in
[1:30:01] prayer I was reading about about Revival
[1:30:04] and realized that the entire theme of
[1:30:06] Revival comes through
[1:30:10] prayer without prayer there's no
[1:30:15] Revival however much we have the word it
[1:30:18] is Revival that brings the dynamic amen
[1:30:24] it is the spirit that
[1:30:26] Quicken and the spirit comes through
[1:30:28] prayer Jesus told them go wait in the
[1:30:32] upper room until the day of the
[1:30:35] Pentecost amen and the Bible says they
[1:30:37] were waiting in prayer praise be to God

[1:31:04] praying and waiting blessed be the name
[1:31:08] of the
[1:31:10] Lord and what kind of prayer are they
[1:31:13] making in the upper
[1:31:15] room they had a big challenge because
[1:31:19] their Master had been taken away from
[1:31:21] them Jesus had left to heaven
[1:31:24] [Applause]
[1:31:26] amen and they were
[1:31:32] there they had never even heard about
[1:31:35] the Holy Ghost they heard it from Jesus
[1:31:37] that if I don't go the comat will not
[1:31:40] come what were they wrestling
[1:31:43] with they're pulling down all the
[1:31:46] stronghold imaginations amen that devil
[1:31:50] was speaking to them he will not come

[1:31:54] that even in the scroll and indeed
[1:31:57] there's nowhere in the scroll praise be
[1:32:00] to God so they had to fight against that
[1:32:03] thoughts and
[1:32:05] ideas say it is written he said it must
[1:32:09] come to
[1:32:10] pass
[1:32:11] [Applause]
[1:32:13] amen many time the Devil comes and try
[1:32:16] to convince us that what
[1:32:24] let it start with
[1:32:25] you tell the devil okay if I've never
[1:32:29] seen it well and good but it's starting
[1:32:31] with me
[1:32:35] today taking the shield of Faith
[1:32:38] amen Faith knows no
[1:32:42] Hance Faith knows no
[1:32:45] wall but what I'm saying that faith has
[1:32:48] been hair on his chest and when he
[1:32:52] speaks and every demon will
[1:32:59] silence
[1:33:04] amen when Fai speaks When Faith
[1:33:09] shouts it's like the sound of the
[1:33:13] lion when the lion
[1:33:16] roars the whole jungle will be silent
[1:33:19] because the King has
[1:33:22] roared and only the lion is that will be
[1:33:26] enjoying amen when Jesus speaks every
[1:33:31] stuation will have to be silenced it's
[1:33:33] only the bride that will rejoice amen
[1:33:37] surely the Lord God has spoken who shall
[1:33:40] not but prophesy amen the lion has throw
[1:33:44] who shall not fear praise be to God it's
[1:33:49] only the bride amen who knows the
[1:33:52] Roaring of the Lion
[1:33:54] what it
[1:33:55] means blessed be the name of the
[1:33:59] Lord amen Daniel says that when when
[1:34:03] Gabriel met Daniel he said the day you
[1:34:06] went in prayer and fasting that very
[1:34:09] day his prayer was
[1:34:12] answered but what
[1:34:14] happened this is what
[1:34:21] happened the prce is he talks of the
[1:34:25] principalities flesh and blood but
[1:34:27] against the
[1:34:29] principalities against the
[1:34:31] powers against the rulers of Darkness
[1:34:35] the rulers of Darkness captured gab and
[1:34:39] in prison Angel gab in
[1:34:45] prison brother talk of the force that
[1:34:50] can capture the entire angel
[1:34:58] Daniel never gave
[1:35:01] up he
[1:35:03] insisted he persisted amen why because
[1:35:08] the aner
[1:35:12] hold when Daniel was praying he realized
[1:35:16] his faith has gotten hold of something
[1:35:19] Yonder
[1:35:20] amen the answer was not coming but the
[1:35:23] man of God was not giving up why because
[1:35:27] the anchor hold though the Sheep is
[1:35:30] battered by the aner
[1:35:32] hold amen and when we continue in prayer
[1:35:37] guess
[1:35:39] what
[1:35:41] hallelujah praise be to God when the man
[1:35:44] was
[1:35:46] praying God called for another Emer
[1:35:50] meeting they called Search and Destroy
[1:35:54] Mission praise be to God
[1:35:57] Amen I believe when Gabriel was in
[1:36:00] prison and Michael saw it he saw him in
[1:36:04] prison oh glory be to God he said you
[1:36:08] wait I'm coming amen maybe he was there
[1:36:12] and then the call he received a call say
[1:36:16] hi
[1:36:19] while I'm coming blessed be the name of
[1:36:22] the Lord
[1:36:24] the devil thought that he had sure win
[1:36:28] but he didn't know what God was planning
[1:36:31] the Devil comes and shame you with
[1:36:33] sickness and he thinks you are done but
[1:36:37] doesn't know what God is having for you
[1:36:39] he said in Jeremiah I know the thought
[1:36:41] that I have toward you amen a thought of
[1:36:45] peace to bring to unexpected
[1:36:48] End
[1:36:50] Amen so when the angel was in prison
[1:36:54] I believe Michael did not just come
[1:36:56] silently that's not our God
[1:37:01] Amen if you want me to prove that by
[1:37:03] scriptures the Bible says that when the
[1:37:06] Israel when they wanted to see him do
[1:37:09] you know what happened that day when God
[1:37:11] appeared they were busy
[1:37:22] waiting so thought he would come gently
[1:37:25] like a gentle God is a gentleman by the
[1:37:27] way but
[1:37:30] sometime he comes according to the
[1:37:32] situation you are in blessed be the name
[1:37:35] of the Lord because the these are
[1:37:37] rebellious and very stubborn God also
[1:37:40] came in a stubborn way so when they busy
[1:37:44] waiting they had the
[1:37:47] Thunders they had the earthquake the
[1:37:50] lightening Hallelujah then they cried to
[1:37:54] Moses said no tell him to go blessed be
[1:37:57] the name of the Lord I believe when
[1:37:59] Gabriel was in
[1:38:01] prison Daniel was in prayer don't forget
[1:38:05] we are talking about prayer this man was
[1:38:08] praying because the anchor was
[1:38:12] holding he was holding unto God's Word
[1:38:16] of
[1:38:17] Promise he knew God promised it he spoke
[1:38:20] it through Prophet Jeremiah it will come
[1:38:23] to
[1:38:25] bur an angel
[1:38:27] came broke the chain I believe Satan the
[1:38:32] devil even fainted because when Gabriel
[1:38:35] came to Daniel he said that I have to go
[1:38:38] very
[1:38:42] fast blessed be the name of the Lord and
[1:38:46] that's what the devil
[1:38:48] Mistakes by the time gain back his
[1:38:51] consci
[1:38:56] praise be to God because he
[1:38:59] said he will beat our enemies they will
[1:39:02] come in one way but we will give them a
[1:39:05] hot one and scatters them in Seven
[1:39:08] direction

[1:39:16] cannot take it away because the world
[1:39:19] did not give it to me even the devil
[1:39:21] cannot take it away because the they
[1:39:23] will not give it to
[1:39:26] you and that's why we say said the joy
[1:39:28] of the Lord is our strength when we make
[1:39:31] God happy that's when we are
[1:39:34] stronger
[1:39:36] amen praise be to God Daniel insisted he
[1:39:41] never gave up so my brother my sister we
[1:39:44] have come to wage war with the powers of
