[55:54] [singing]
[55:56] And we have come under expectation,

[56:04] to feed from this ministry in this hour.
[56:06] Lord,
[56:09] I pray that you prepare their hearts.
[56:12] All those under the sound of our voice
[56:13] tonight,
[56:16] both hear the seen and unseen. Lord,
[56:20] Father, I pray that you'll minister to
[56:21] us.
[56:23] We have come expecting
[56:25] to meet a living savior.
[56:29] Take the man [music] of God and put him
[56:30] aside
[56:33] and Lord take that gift in him
[56:36] and Lord that he will minister as he
[56:38] [music] would minister to his people.

[56:46] We ask this in Jesus name.
[56:50] Amen. Amen.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:53] &gt;&gt; Well, God bless you saints. Nice to see
[56:55] those uh who have made it so far.
[57:01] Amen. Are you under expectation tonight?
[57:05] Amen. I just want to to say that this
[57:08] was is the doing of the Lord.
[57:11] Actually,
[57:13] I announced that Pastor Simon Peter will
[57:16] be preaching to us on Wednesday.
[57:21] But uh little did I know that actually
[57:23] the ticket I had misread it.
[57:28] He was supposed to be leaving uh last
[57:32] night
[57:35] uh back to New York.
[57:38] Uh but as God had planned it,
[57:42] You know that's brother that's why we're
[57:43] not a denomination
[57:46] you know we believe ABCD and as much as
[57:48] God shall reveal
[57:52] you know so you plan you make your plans
[57:56] make your programs
[57:58] we have programs
[58:00] but also God always has programs
[58:04] so this is the program of God
[58:08] and as I don't know about you but for
[58:11] I am 100% sure
[58:13] that God planned this meeting today
[58:18] and uh he knows what you need.
[58:22] Um just hold it. Be under expectation
[58:27] and that God is going to speak to you.
[58:31] We had wonderful meetings in Karamojido.
[58:36] Um um I had about perhaps 7,000 people
[58:41] or more
[58:44] and uh you know we we did a little alter
[58:48] call after the ministry of pastor Simon
[58:54] I didn't count but probably more
[58:58] just a few thousands I should say
[59:02] you you can see what impact that you
[59:04] know the ministry we had there.
[59:08] We also had some time with the
[59:09] ministers, pastors.
[59:12] I tell you, we had a good time.
[59:16] So, Pastor Simon felt it on his heart
[59:18] and we asked him, but he failed it as
[59:20] well.
[59:23] Extend his ticket.
[59:25] We are not only going to have him today,
[59:29] we also going to have him on Sunday.
[59:33] So hallelujah.
[59:34] &gt;&gt; So uh it's a wonderful it's a blessed
[59:37] week for us.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; We are finishing the year powerful.
[59:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. At least even we usually call them
[59:46] the Sunday mail. At least the Sunday
[59:47] mail can also not miss
[59:54] those brethren who don't you know come
[59:56] to midweek at this
[1:00:02] We'll give you more program after the
[1:00:03] ministry of the word. For now, we just
[1:00:05] want to
[1:00:09] under expectation.
[1:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Pastor Simon and we are so happy
[1:00:15] to have you.
[1:00:17] You know, we first met in Zimbabwe.
[1:00:21] You remember the meet the meeting I went
[1:00:23] to? Uh the meetings I went to,
[1:00:26] dedication meetings. How many remember
[1:00:28] that?
[1:00:30] So that's where I met him.
[1:00:33] I want to tell you it was a divine
[1:00:35] connection,
[1:00:38] a divine purpose.
[1:00:40] We come to love each other very much
[1:00:44] and he's a senior brother to me and he's
[1:00:47] been in the ministry for many many more
[1:00:49] years than I have.
[1:00:52] And uh I really honor him
[1:00:55] and we've spent quality time even in
[1:00:57] fellowship
[1:01:00] Let me not take the time for the word.
[1:01:03] We will talk the rest afterwards.
[1:01:05] Amen. Let us sing Amazing Grace.
[1:01:10] I've told Pastor Simon to take his
[1:01:12] liberty, have his liberty
[1:01:16] and preach as if he's preaching uh to
[1:01:19] his church back at home.
[1:01:22] Can you say amen if you agree?
[1:01:27] A
[1:01:30] sing grace. Come on, sing with me now.

[1:04:40] it worth all the investment.

[1:04:47] grant them traveling mercy

[1:05:01] scripture and have you seated

[1:05:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want to keep you standing for
[1:05:09] long
[1:05:11] &gt;&gt; Romans chapter 4
[1:05:16] vers 12
[1:05:28] and the father of circumcision to them
[1:05:32] who are not of the circumcision
[1:05:37] only but also who walk in the steps of
[1:05:41] that faith of our faith. father Abraham,
[1:05:44] which he had been yet uncircumcised.
[1:06:08] May God bless the reading of his word.
[1:06:12] May please take your seat.
[1:06:16] Amen. We like to greet you all this
[1:06:19] evening
[1:06:21] in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[1:06:23] Christ.
[1:06:26] Certainly an honor for us to be here.
[1:06:30] It's my first time in Uganda.
[1:06:34] I never knew or I would I never had a
[1:06:37] pull to come here.
[1:06:42] We've met different preachers from
[1:06:45] Uganda came to our church.
[1:06:50] Quite a few of them,
[1:06:53] but uh invitations have been extended to
[1:06:56] me.
[1:06:59] But I had never felt the urge to come
[1:07:01] the meeting
[1:07:04] till I met your pastor in Zimbabwe.
[1:07:08] Zimbabwe
[1:07:09] Ille.
[1:07:13] I have heard about him
[1:07:17] for many many years.
[1:07:20] Sometime brothers in Canada will ask me
[1:07:22] do you know this brother?
[1:07:25] used to ask
[1:07:27] I don't know him
[1:07:29] but God has a time
[1:07:32] there are seasons for everything
[1:07:35] and so this time we met in Zimbabwe we
[1:07:37] got connected
[1:07:40] but I didn't know I will come to Uganda
[1:07:43] so soon
[1:07:47] we thank God that we are here we've
[1:07:51] enjoyed our stay
[1:07:54] in the car
[1:07:58] London. We enjoy the fellowship of the
[1:08:00] priest.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; Yes, like you said, I I I'm supposed to
[1:08:05] have been home today,
[1:08:08] but God changed the program.
[1:08:11] So, we thank God.
[1:08:14] We just follow his leadership.
[1:08:19] May God bless you.
[1:08:21] Are you happy to be in the house of the
[1:08:22] Lord?
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that you can be in
[1:08:27] this time is to be a son and a daughter
[1:08:29] of God.
[1:08:35] So this evening
[1:08:37] want to speak on a subject. It's a small
[1:08:40] subject.
[1:08:42] I want to talk about father Abraham.
[1:08:46] The Paul was writing. He said, "But who
[1:08:50] also walk in the step of the faith of
[1:08:52] our father Abraham."
[1:08:59] So tonight I want to speak on walking in
[1:09:01] the steps
[1:09:04] and faith of our father Abraham.
[1:09:09] Amen. Abraham is the father of our
[1:09:12] faith.
[1:09:14] Amen. Uh he walked with God.
[1:09:18] and his work pleased God.
[1:09:22] When God was given a promise to Abraham,
[1:09:26] God
[1:09:28] gave him the promise.
[1:09:30] But the promise was not only for
[1:09:32] Abraham.
[1:09:35] The promise was to Abraham and his seed.
[1:09:39] Amen. And so if we are the seed of
[1:09:42] Abraham,
[1:09:44] how do we become seed?
[1:09:47] He said by you know when [clears throat]
[1:09:49] Christ is that seed of Abraham.
[1:09:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when Christ is in you.
[1:09:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you are a child of Abraham.
[1:10:01] Just for background,
[1:10:04] God has set in motion laws and
[1:10:07] principles,
[1:10:12] tie them to the earth
[1:10:16] and that cannot or will never change.
[1:10:21] And uh there are blessings,
[1:10:26] amen, of God.
[1:10:29] There are laws of God.
[1:10:32] There are spiritual laws and there are
[1:10:35] there are natural laws.
[1:10:38] There's a law of sewing and reaping.
[1:10:41] Amen. There are different laws.
[1:10:46] Now when you apply that law,
[1:10:51] it will work for you.
[1:10:56] In the message here he him brother Bham
[1:10:58] said
[1:11:01] we are living under our godgiven
[1:11:04] privileges.
[1:11:09] God has redeemed us too.
[1:11:13] So there are privileges.
[1:11:15] There are blessings.
[1:11:28] God has redeemed us.
[1:11:31] The psalist says, "Bless the Lord, oh my
[1:11:33] soul.
[1:11:37] And all that is within me.
[1:11:40] Praise his holy name." He said, "Forget
[1:11:43] not all his benefits.
[1:11:48] Amen. There are benefits when you serve
[1:11:51] God.
[1:11:54] In the message will see Jesus
[1:11:58] the prophet prophet of God said, "Oh,
[1:12:01] this is a great hour.
[1:12:04] I'm so glad to be living here."
[1:12:08] Moses would have loved to live IN THIS
[1:12:10] TIME.
[1:12:13] ALL THE apostles would have liked to
[1:12:15] have been living in this time.
[1:12:19] And here we are living in this time and
[1:12:24] living under our privileges
[1:12:28] how that God wants to bless his people.
[1:12:34] Prophet of God is telling us
[1:12:37] somewhere said this day is a golden day.
[1:12:41] WE ARE LIVING IN the most glorious hour.
[1:12:46] Prophets of God, we are looking forward
[1:12:48] to see this day
[1:12:53] to live in the season that we are living
[1:12:54] in
[1:12:57] so much blessings.
[1:12:59] But we are living the prophet said we
[1:13:01] are living under our God-given
[1:13:03] providence.
[1:13:07] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:13:10] In the restoration of the bride tree,
[1:13:14] God's prophet said, "GOD HAS SET ALL of
[1:13:17] his laws to serve him,
[1:13:23] both natural and spiritual.
[1:13:27] Working according to his word,
[1:13:32] regardless of the condition."
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; I want you TO REMEMBER THAT. REGARDLESS
[1:13:38] OF THE CONDITIONS.
[1:13:42] I love that he said
[1:13:46] I had soak in now.
[1:13:50] Now I had scripture here on that. I'm
[1:13:53] sorry.
[1:13:55] God set all of his laws in motion.
[1:14:01] Think of it. Let it soak in. Now, as we
[1:14:05] are coming to a healing service in a few
[1:14:07] minutes,
[1:14:10] God set all of his laws into motion.
[1:14:16] It must work according to his own word.
[1:14:21] Are you getting it? See, his word, HIS
[1:14:25] LAWS has to work according to his word.
[1:14:29] He commanded the son. He commanded the
[1:14:32] moon. He commanded the earth. He
[1:14:36] commanded nature. And they all fall
[1:14:39] right in line.
[1:14:41] AND ALL THE LAWS WORK in harmony with
[1:14:44] God's spoken word.
[1:14:48] And the law of life that is in us
[1:14:52] will also bring us to a resurrection.
[1:14:56] It's cattle.
[1:14:58] It's impossible for it not.
[1:15:02] Praise the name of the Lord. SO THE
[1:15:04] PROPHET OF GOD, IF you notice that the
[1:15:06] laws of God work according to the word,
[1:15:11] REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION,
[1:15:15] blessed be the name OF THE LORD.
[1:15:17] REGARDLESS OF THE CONDITION in Uganda,
[1:15:21] REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU LIVE, REGARDLESS
[1:15:24] OF WHAT YOU FACE,
[1:15:26] GOD'S LAW CAN STILL WORK FOR YOU.
[1:15:30] Pray for the name of the Lord.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; I'd like to read the prophet.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:38] &gt;&gt; In the message Elijah,
[1:15:41] BROTHER BENAM SAID, "BROTHER, I TELL
[1:15:44] YOU, when a man is really getting
[1:15:47] hungering and thirsting for God,
[1:15:52] he will RECEIVE IT."
[1:15:54] THE TROUBLE OF IT is
[1:15:57] that the church is not hungry enough
[1:15:59] tonight for GOD
[1:16:03] is the reason the Holy Spirit is not
[1:16:05] moving in the church tonight.
[1:16:09] That's the reason the signs of the
[1:16:11] apostle
[1:16:13] they sometimes say brother Brennham
[1:16:16] how does the healing and miracle and
[1:16:18] signs and wondering
[1:16:21] he said it will work if you believe it.
[1:16:27] If you will take God at his word
[1:16:31] it will produce
[1:16:33] God let me live to prove that around the
[1:16:35] world that that is true.
[1:16:39] And so will it work tonight
[1:16:43] in a drought
[1:16:47] or anything else?
[1:16:49] IF YOU'LL MEET God's condition,
[1:16:53] God will meet you on those grounds.
[1:16:58] You've got TO COME TO HIS CONDITIONS.
[1:17:02] Blessed be the name OF THE LORD. THE
[1:17:05] WORD OF THE LORD,
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; THE PROMISES of God
[1:17:10] will work AT ANY TIME
[1:17:13] UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE
[1:17:15] IN THE TIME OF FAMINE.
[1:17:18] THAT IS WHY IN THE DAYS OF ELIJAH
[1:17:21] when the people were languishing,
[1:17:24] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? AMEN. THE WORD OF THE
[1:17:27] LORD
[1:17:28] WORKED FOR ELIJAH THE PROPHET.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY AS BELIEVERS WE
[1:17:35] ARE NOT LIVING UNDER THE CONDITION
[1:17:38] OF UGANDA.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; WE ARE NOT LIVING UNDER THE ECONOMY OF
[1:17:42] UGANDA
[1:17:44] BUT WE ARE LIVING UNDER A DIFFERENT
[1:17:45] ECONOMY.
[1:17:47] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. TO THEM
[1:17:50] THAT BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:17:54] We are connected to another economy.
[1:17:59] WHEN YOU OBEY THE LAWS OF GOD, ANYTHING,
[1:18:03] ANY PROMISE
[1:18:06] ACCORDING TO HIS WORD,
[1:18:08] IT WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS
[1:18:11] TO THE ECONOMY OF HEAVEN.
[1:18:14] IT WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN.
[1:18:17] BLESSED be the NAME OF THE LORD. WHEN
[1:18:20] THE WOMAN W OBEYED the word of THE LORD,
[1:18:24] SHE opened up a window of blessing.
[1:18:28] WHILE THE [screaming] NATION WAS
[1:18:30] ENTERING AND STARVING,
[1:18:34] she was feeding and ENJOYING
[1:18:39] EVIDENCE FROM THE BANK OF HEAVEN.
[1:18:43] Blessed be the NAME OF THE LORD. OH, MAY
[1:18:46] GOD HELP US TONIGHT.
[1:18:48] MAY GOD GIVE US GRACE.
[1:18:50] So believe God. DON'T LOOK AT YOUR
[1:18:53] CIRCUMSTANCE.
[1:18:55] DON'T LOOK AT YOUR SITUATION.
[1:18:57] DON'T LOOK AT WHAT YOU ARE FACING.
[1:18:59] BELIEVE THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:19:02] WHAT SAID IT WILL WORK [screaming] FOR
[1:19:05] YOU UNDER ANY CONDITION.
[1:19:09] HALLELUJAH. Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:19:12] [cheering and applause]
[1:19:13] &gt;&gt; In the message reproach for the cause of
[1:19:15] the word.
[1:19:19] BROTHER SAID GOD MADE A PROMISE THAT HE
[1:19:23] WILL bless
[1:19:26] but THEM BLESSINGS
[1:19:29] ARE under conditions.
[1:19:33] YOU'VE GOT TO MEET THOSE CONDITION
[1:19:37] TO MAKE that work.
[1:19:40] Are we together? Blessed be the NAME OF
[1:19:43] THE LORD. GOD PROMISED TO BLESS YOU.
[1:19:46] BUT THOSE BLESSINGS ARE UNDER
[1:19:48] [screaming] CONDITIONS.
[1:19:50] SALVATION IS FREE.
[1:19:53] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BUT THE BLESSINGS THAT
[1:19:56] ACCOMPANY SALVATION,
[1:19:59] THERE ARE CONDITIONS
[1:20:01] THAT ARE ATTACHED TO IT.
[1:20:04] IN ORDER TO BENEFIT, [screaming]
[1:20:07] YOU have to meet THE
[1:20:14] in the message influence 63
[1:20:18] SAID ALL [screaming] PROMISES OF GOD ARE
[1:20:20] true
[1:20:23] but they are unconditioned.
[1:20:27] No matter how fundamentally right we
[1:20:30] are,
[1:20:33] WE'VE GOT TO APPROACH IT IN THE RIGHT
[1:20:35] WAY.
[1:20:38] NOW, MEN CAN BE FUNDAMENTALLY right
[1:20:46] and still not receive the blessings of
[1:20:49] God
[1:20:53] because it's approached THE WRONG WAY.
[1:20:59] PROVERBS SAID IT goes on condition.
[1:21:04] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; That is why even there's a prostitute
[1:21:13] unbelievers
[1:21:16] when they hear the word
[1:21:19] they their faith will rise up to a level
[1:21:23] and they will receive their healing.
[1:21:28] And sometime believers will come
[1:21:32] and they are believers, CHILDREN OF GOD,
[1:21:35] FAIL TO GET HERE.
[1:21:41] AMEN. AMEN.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; WHENEVER YOU FULFILL THE CONDITIONS OF
[1:21:45] THE WORD
[1:21:47] ON A PROMISE MADE BY GOD,
[1:21:51] you will GET RESULTS.
[1:21:54] HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:56] BROTHER BENHAM SAID, "GOD IS OBLIGATED
[1:21:59] TO HIS PROMISES."
[1:22:07] Bam knew
[1:22:09] Balam, the prophet Bam.
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; HE KNEW THAT IF I DO THIS AND I do that,
[1:22:15] God will come to me.
[1:22:20] He was a gifted man.
[1:22:23] Praise the name of the Lord.
[1:22:25] but a false prophet.
[1:22:27] Remember, gifts and calling of God are
[1:22:29] without repentance.
[1:22:33] HE KNEW WHAT TO DO
[1:22:36] TO GET AN audience from God.
[1:22:42] Amen.
[1:22:44] AND WHEN YOU APPROACHED GOD THAT WAY,
[1:22:48] GOD CAME DOWN
[1:22:50] and spoke to him.
[1:22:56] Hallelujah.
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said in exposition of the
[1:23:00] churches.
[1:23:03] He said THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ATTEMPT TO
[1:23:05] OPERATE GIFTS.
[1:23:08] They will MAKE USE OF A GIFT
[1:23:12] WHICH HAS A MARGIN OF ERROR
[1:23:16] IN IT.
[1:23:18] Then they ask for money
[1:23:20] and declare the word of God
[1:23:24] and call it of God.
[1:23:27] So you can see even in organizations
[1:23:31] Pentecostal preachers, denominational
[1:23:32] preachers,
[1:23:34] THEY CAN TAKE A PROMISE OF GOD'S WORD
[1:23:38] AND WAVE THAT PROMISE OVER THE
[1:23:40] CONGREGATION
[1:23:42] AND the people ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT
[1:23:44] PORTION OF THE WORD.
[1:23:46] [screaming] GOD WILL COME DOWN AND HEAL
[1:23:49] THEM. CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE OF GOD.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH MORE ABOUT US AS BELIEVERS?
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHY SAID THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:24:05] LOVE THY SON ONLY BELIEVE ALL THINGS ARE
[1:24:10] POSSIBLE.
[1:24:15] AMEN.
[1:24:18] May God help us.
[1:24:21] I'm trying to lay a foundation.
[1:24:25] If I don't finish then Sunday I will
[1:24:30] I want to take my time.
[1:24:32] I want you to get what you are saying
[1:24:35] what I'm saying
[1:24:38] in the message s will see Jesus
[1:24:42] SAID AND SO DOES THE BLESSINGS OF THE
[1:24:45] LAST DAY
[1:24:48] BELONG TO THIS CHURCH
[1:24:51] BUT [screaming] UNDER CONDITION.
[1:24:54] YOU'VE GOT TO MEET THOSE CONDITIONS.
[1:24:59] If you don't, you can have all kinds of
[1:25:02] healing services,
[1:25:05] shouting services,
[1:25:08] PRAISING SERVICES,
[1:25:10] FRUIT SERVICES,
[1:25:12] SPEAKING IN TONGUE SERVICES,
[1:25:14] AND IT WILL DO YOU NO good at all.
[1:25:18] YOU START TO COME TO [screaming] GOD'S
[1:25:20] CONDITIONS.
[1:25:27] WHEN any man or ANY WOMAN
[1:25:30] MEET CERTAIN CONDITIONS
[1:25:34] of a scriptural promise,
[1:25:37] then they will reap the benefit of that
[1:25:39] scripture.
[1:25:42] BUT STILL THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY
[1:25:44] are safe.
[1:25:54] That's right. He was speaking about
[1:25:56] Israel.
[1:25:58] The message perseverance
[1:26:01] say here's where we got the idea.
[1:26:04] THE LAND of Israel BELONGED TO THE
[1:26:06] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL. GOD GAVE IT TO THEM.
[1:26:10] BUT THEIR SINS HAD DROVE THEM AWAY FROM
[1:26:12] IT.
[1:26:17] THEY THOUGHT BECAUSE THE LAND BELONGED
[1:26:19] TO THEM
[1:26:21] and that was all THEY HAD TO HAVE. NO
[1:26:23] SIR,
[1:26:26] it's on conditions.
[1:26:29] ABSOLUTELY.
[1:26:31] YOU CAN HAVE DIVINE HEALING.
[1:26:33] YOU CAN HAVE SALVATION.
[1:26:36] YOU CAN HAVE THE baptism of the Holy
[1:26:37] Ghost.
[1:26:39] BUT THAT IS ON CONDITIONS
[1:26:43] THAT YOU MEET GOD'S CONDITIONS.
[1:26:46] OUTSIDE OF [screaming] THAT,
[1:26:49] IT'S NOT for nobody but believers.
[1:26:59] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:27:02] IN THREE KINDS OF BELIEVERS, HE SAID
[1:27:06] NATURE HAS A LAW.
[1:27:10] THERE IS A LAW OF NATURE.
[1:27:13] THERE'S NO WAY AT ALL TO GET AROUND IT.
[1:27:16] There's no way to get around it.
[1:27:20] It is a LAW OF NATURE.
[1:27:22] AND THERE IS A LAW OF THE SPIRIT.
[1:27:26] AND THERE IS ALSO NO WAY TO GET AROUND
[1:27:29] THAT.
[1:27:32] Praise the name of THE LORD. IN MARRIAGE
[1:27:35] AND DIVORCES,
[1:27:38] protect the honorest woman in TOWN
[1:27:43] and the worst man.
[1:27:45] If they had a baby,
[1:27:49] it will have to come from the Lord.
[1:27:59] BECAUSE GOD HAS LAWS SET TOGETHER.
[1:28:05] AND THIS LAWS
[1:28:07] LIKE THE SUN TO RISE.
[1:28:10] YOU PUT a cocker in in a good field, it
[1:28:13] will GROW
[1:28:17] AND IT HAS TO GROW
[1:28:20] BECAUSE IT IS God's law.
[1:28:23] HALLELUJAH. WHEN SIN IS PLANTED,
[1:28:27] IT MUST GROW. AND NOTHING CAN GROW LIFE
[1:28:31] BUT GOD
[1:28:34] BECAUSE IT OPERATES UNDER HIS LAW.
[1:28:41] THEREFORE,
[1:28:43] WHEN THE EVIL SEED WAS PLANTED IN THE
[1:28:45] WOMB OF EVE,
[1:28:48] it had TO [screaming] BRING FORTH
[1:28:51] BECAUSE IT IS GOD'S LAW OF PRODUCTION
[1:28:56] AND IT COULD DO NOTHING ELSE BUT BRING
[1:28:58] IT.
[1:29:02] It had to it had to come.
[1:29:05] Are we together? Blessed be the name of
[1:29:08] THE LORD. SO THERE ARE NATURAL LAWS.
[1:29:13] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; science science
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; will tell you they will never tell you
[1:29:21] that they create anything.
[1:29:25] They will tell you that they discover.
[1:29:29] That's right.
[1:29:30] &gt;&gt; IT'S A DISCOVERY.
[1:29:32] IF THEY DISCOVER THAT MEAN IT WAS ALWAYS
[1:29:34] THERE.
[1:29:37] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:29:39] SAID TELEVISION WAS HERE WHEN ADAM WAS
[1:29:42] IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN.
[1:29:46] BUT WHEN THIS MAN WILL GO USE THE
[1:29:48] NATURAL LAWS
[1:29:52] of physics of mathematics,
[1:29:55] you'll begin to enter INTO A REALM.
[1:29:59] BREAK INTO A CERTAIN DIMENSION
[1:30:02] AND DISCOVER THOSE THINGS THAT WERE
[1:30:04] ALREADY THERE
[1:30:06] THAT WAS ALWAYS THERE. CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[1:30:10] And they bring it into THIS DIMENSION.
[1:30:14] THEN WE BEGIN TO ENJOY.
[1:30:17] THAT IS WHY WE HAVE CELL PHONES AND ALL
[1:30:20] OF THE THINGS WE ARE USING TODAY.
[1:30:23] THEY WERE ALWAYS [screaming] THERE.
[1:30:26] AMEN.
[1:30:28] That's right.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; I want us to look at our father Abraham
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; and we'll look at some laws tonight
[1:30:44] and we'll see how the Lord will lead us
[1:30:48] in Genesis 14.
[1:30:52] That was when Melisedc appeared to
[1:30:54] Abraham.
[1:30:57] The Bible says verse 19, "And he blessed
[1:31:02] him AND SAID, "BLESSED BE ABRAHAM
[1:31:06] OF the most high God,
[1:31:08] POSSESSOR OF HEAVEN and earth."
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; And blessed BE THE MOST HIGH GOD,
[1:31:21] which had delivered thine enemies into
[1:31:23] thine hand. AND HE GAVE HIM [screaming]
[1:31:26] TIGHTS of all.
[1:31:34] Are you with me?
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; After Abraham went to war,
[1:31:41] WHEN HE CONQUERED THE war
[1:31:45] and as HE WAS GOING BACK,
[1:31:48] A man appeared TO HIM. MECHISEDC
[1:31:51] APPEARED to him. CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:31:54] GOD CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF MELKISEDC
[1:31:58] AND MECHISEDC IS THE OFFICE OF A
[1:32:01] PRIESTHOOD.
[1:32:04] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; HE APPEARED TO ABRAHAM
[1:32:08] IN THAT MECHISEDC PRIESTHOOD.
[1:32:12] ABRAHAM BY DIVINE REVELATION.
[1:32:16] ARE WE TOGETHER? ALL REVEALED TO HIM
[1:32:20] THAT IF THIS IS THE PRIEST OF THE MOST
[1:32:22] HIGH
[1:32:24] I MUST PAY TO
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HE DID NOT COME TO HIM LIKE
[1:32:33] HE APPEARED TO JOSHUA AS THE ANGEL OF
[1:32:35] THE LORD.
[1:32:39] THE BIBLE
[1:32:41] WHENEVER THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE DONE
[1:32:44] GOD WILL ALWAYS EMULATE
[1:32:48] he will change the form.
[1:32:55] IF IT IS A TIME TO GO AND FIGHT,
[1:32:59] HE WILL APPEAR IN THE FORM OF THE ANGEL
[1:33:00] OF THE LORD.
[1:33:03] THE ANGEL OF THE LORD
[1:33:06] IS THE ANGEL OF ANGELS.
[1:33:09] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? BECAUSE IT'S A TIME OF
[1:33:12] WAR [screaming]
[1:33:14] TO JOSHUA
[1:33:16] AS THE CAPTAIN OF THE HORSE.
[1:33:19] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. BECAUSE
[1:33:21] JOSHUA WAS A SOLDIER.
[1:33:24] IT WAS A TIME TO GO TO WAR.
[1:33:27] NOW APPEARING AS A MIGHTY CONQUEROR,
[1:33:30] A GREAT WARRIOR. HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WAY HE REVEALED HIMSELF TO
[1:33:35] JOSHUA.
[1:33:36] AND THAT REVELATION
[1:33:39] JOSHUA FAITH.
[1:33:42] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. HE TOOK
[1:33:44] AWAY ALL THE FEAR.
[1:33:47] HE KNEW THAT THE [screaming] ANGEL OF
[1:33:48] THE LORD WAS LEADING THE BATTLE.
[1:33:52] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE CAME TO ABRAHAM,
[1:33:56] HE CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF
[1:34:01] WHEN ABRAHAM SAW [screaming] HIM SAY,
[1:34:04] "OH, THIS IS THE PRIEST." CAN WE SAY
[1:34:06] AMEN? SAY THE PRIEST OF THE MOST HIGH.
[1:34:10] AND ABRAHAM struck Revelation.
[1:34:14] If this is the PRIEST OF THE [screaming]
[1:34:16] MOST HIGH, I MUST PRAY TIGHT.
[1:34:20] CAN WE say amen?
[1:34:22] Blessed be the name of
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; How did he introduce himself?
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; In verse 19,
[1:34:33] it said, "And he blessed him,
[1:34:36] blessed be Abraham, most high God,
[1:34:41] POSSESSOR [screaming] OF THE HEAVEN AND
[1:34:43] THE EARTH."
[1:34:46] Can we say amen?
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM GOT THE REVELATION.
[1:34:52] THAT THIS MAN THAT APPEARED TO HIM,
[1:34:55] GOD CAME TO HIM IN THE FORM OF A PRIEST.
[1:35:00] ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THIS MAN IS THE
[1:35:03] POSSESSOR
[1:35:05] OF HEAVEN AND EARTH. [screaming]
[1:35:08] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO IF IS THE POSSESSION
[1:35:13] OF HEAVEN AND [screaming] EARTH
[1:35:16] COME TO THE REALIZATION
[1:35:18] THAT WHATEVER HE GETS
[1:35:21] WHATEVER BLESSING YOU HAVE IS COMING
[1:35:23] FROM THIS MAN.
[1:35:26] [cheering]
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; AND SO SINCE HE [screaming] HAS BLESSED
[1:35:30] ME, I'M GOING TO PAY TITHE TO HIM.
[1:35:35] HALLELUJAH.
[1:35:41] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; You see
[1:35:48] tithing
[1:35:51] did not start
[1:35:53] in the law.
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Tithing, paying tithe
[1:36:00] started before even Moses was born.
[1:36:12] SO WE SEE AS God the same God appeared
[1:36:15] to Abraham
[1:36:18] will now introduce this to the church in
[1:36:22] the wilderness.
[1:36:26] When you go to farm
[1:36:28] God has blessed your farm. God has
[1:36:31] blessed your word. Amen. You must take
[1:36:34] one.
[1:36:37] Amen. Belongs to God. That's right.
[1:36:45] The law of sewing and reaping
[1:36:50] came before the law of Moses
[1:36:55] in Genesis after the flood.
[1:36:59] God was speaking to Noah.
[1:37:02] He said, "While the earth remainth,
[1:37:06] seed time AND HARVEST TIME, COLD AND
[1:37:10] HEAT, COLD AND HEAT,
[1:37:13] SUMMER AND WINTER,
[1:37:17] marriage shall not cease.
[1:37:22] TITHING DID NOT BEGIN during the law.
[1:37:26] EXISTED BEFORE THE COMMANDMENTS WERE
[1:37:28] GIVEN."
[1:37:31] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; SO THAT IS WHY ABRAHAM,
[1:37:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. was driven by divine
[1:37:38] revelation.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:50] &gt;&gt; Cain and
[1:37:52] brother said they pay tithe.
[1:37:57] That's right.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; IN A MESSAGE EARNESTLY CONTENDING for
[1:37:59] the faith.
[1:38:02] He say YOU MIGHT BE A GOOD BAPTIST BOY.
[1:38:08] I know you.
[1:38:10] Let's get down right to the showdown.
[1:38:12] Now
[1:38:14] if fundamentalism IS RIGHT,
[1:38:18] GOD SHOULD NEVER REFUSE BAM'S OFFERING.
[1:38:25] If if fundamentalism is right,
[1:38:29] I SHOULD NEVER HAVE REJECTED CAIN.
[1:38:32] KANE WAS JUST AS RELIGIOUS AS ABRAHAM.
[1:38:36] He made a offering.
[1:38:39] HE WENT TO CHURCH. HE PAID HIS TITHE. HE
[1:38:44] BUILT AN ALTAR. HE WAS SINCERE.
[1:38:47] SO THE PROPHET [screaming] OF GOD IS
[1:38:49] SHOWING US THAT CAIN AND ABEL
[1:38:53] WERE PAYING TITHES AND OFFERINGS TO GOD.
[1:39:00] BUT YOU SEE, THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
[1:39:03] THAT WE do
[1:39:06] that is not tied to our salvation.
[1:39:10] That's right. BUT IT GIVES YOU ACCESS
[1:39:15] TO the blessings of God.
[1:39:18] Hallelujah.
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; Salvation
[1:39:21] is an unmmerited favor.
[1:39:27] WHEN ABRAHAM GAVE TI TO MECHISEDC,
[1:39:31] he did not read IT IN ANY BOOK
[1:39:34] WHEN HE CAME TO HIM BY INSPIRATION
[1:39:38] BY divine revelation.
[1:39:43] SOMETIMES OR MANY TIMES
[1:39:46] WE WILL RECEIVE BLESSINGS FROM GOD
[1:39:49] BUT WE ARE NOT ABLE TO MAINTAIN THOSE
[1:39:51] BLESSINGS
[1:39:53] SECURE THEM.
[1:39:56] AMEN BECAUSE WE DON'T ENSURE THOSE
[1:39:59] BLESSINGS.
[1:40:05] Can we say amen? When you buy a car, I
[1:40:10] don't know how much it work in here in
[1:40:11] in Uganda
[1:40:14] in the west where we live. Do not even
[1:40:16] register your car until you have an
[1:40:18] insurance.
[1:40:21] We insure our cars.
[1:40:24] You have to ensure your home is insured.
[1:40:29] Why do you PUT INSURANCE?
[1:40:32] INSURANCE IS A FORM OF PROTECTION.
[1:40:36] WHEN YOU PURCHASE SOMETHING
[1:40:38] IN CASE OF ANYTHING HAPPEN,
[1:40:41] INSURANCE CAN WILL GIVE YOU BACK THE
[1:40:43] MONEY.
[1:40:45] MAYBE YOU'LL BE ABLE to buy a car.
[1:40:51] Amen.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; THE INSURANCE
[1:40:56] TO YOUR salary
[1:40:59] is the 10.
[1:41:01] Hallelujah. THE
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; IT IS THE 10%
[1:41:05] that protects the 90%.
[1:41:10] Hallelujah.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Are you with
[1:41:14] me? Let me prove it to you by yourself.
[1:41:19] In Malachi 3:8,
[1:41:22] I know this is not new just for the
[1:41:25] purpose of the thought.
[1:41:27] God was saying, "WILL A MAN ROB GOD
[1:41:32] YET? YOU HAVE ROBBED ME."
[1:41:35] BUT YOU SAY, "WHEREIN HAVE [screaming]
[1:41:36] WE ROBBED THEE?"
[1:41:39] IN TITHES AND OFFERINGS.
[1:41:42] THAT'S RIGHT.
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; GOD WAS SPEAKING TO THE CHURCH.
[1:41:47] GOD WAS COMPLAINING.
[1:41:49] YOU SAY, YOU ASK, "WELL, CAN HOW CAN A
[1:41:51] MAN ROB GOD? GOD IS IN HEAVEN. WE ARE ON
[1:41:55] EARTH. HOW CAN WE STEAL FROM GOD?" CAN
[1:41:59] WE SAY AMEN? YOU KNOW, A ROBBER IS MORE
[1:42:03] [screaming] DANGEROUS
[1:42:05] than an ordinary thief.
[1:42:17] SO THOSE [screaming] WHO ARE NOT PAYING
[1:42:18] THEIR TITHES AND OFFERINGS,
[1:42:21] GOD call them robbers.
[1:42:28] Then he said, "YOU ARE CURSED WITH A
[1:42:30] CURSE,
[1:42:32] FOR YE HAVE ROBBED ME,
[1:42:36] EVEN THIS whole nation.
[1:42:40] Are we together?
[1:42:42] Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU DON'T PAY YOUR TITHE AND YOU
[1:42:46] DON'T PAY YOUR OFFERINGS,
[1:42:48] YOU MUST REMEMBER YOU ARE THE SEED OF
[1:42:51] ABRAHAM.
[1:42:53] WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT WALKING IN
[1:42:56] [screaming] THE STEPS
[1:42:58] AND FAITH OF OUR FATHER ABRAHAM?
[1:43:01] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. SO IF WE ARE THE
[1:43:03] SEED OF ABRAHAM,
[1:43:05] EVERY SEED WILL BRING FORTH OF HIS TIME.
[1:43:09] IT WILL BE A STRUGGLE.
[1:43:12] IT WILL BE A PROBLEM. SO A SEED OF
[1:43:15] ABRAHAM TO BAPTIZE AN OFFERING.
[1:43:23] That's right. But you see
[1:43:26] when we talk about offerings
[1:43:29] sometime we just think in the in the
[1:43:30] terms of money
[1:43:35] but we'll show to you maybe on Sunday
[1:43:39] That is more than that.
[1:43:42] Oh my. Oh my. That's right.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID, "BRING YE ALL THE TITHES TO
[1:43:49] THE storehouse
[1:43:51] that there may be meat in mine house
[1:43:55] and prove me now,
[1:43:59] not tomorrow,
[1:44:02] SAY THE LORD OF HOSTS, IF I WILL NOT
[1:44:05] OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN,
[1:44:08] AND POUR OUT A BLESSING,
[1:44:11] BUT THERE SHALL NOT BE ROOM ENOUGH TO
[1:44:13] RECEIVE IT.
[1:44:16] CAN WE SAY AMEN? SO HERE, BROTHER SAID,
[1:44:21] THE PROMISES OF GOD. THEY WALK ACCORDING
[1:44:24] TO THE WORD OF THE LORD.
[1:44:26] THERE is a law.
[1:44:31] ARE WE TOGETHER? IF YOU WANT GOD TO
[1:44:33] BLESS YOU, IF YOU WANT GOD [screaming]
[1:44:36] TO PROSPER YOU, CAN I SAY AMEN? GOD IS
[1:44:40] SAYING TRY ME. GOD IS [screaming]
[1:44:43] THROWING A CHALLENGE
[1:44:45] REGARDLESS OF YOUR CONDITION
[1:44:48] REGARDLESS OF WHERE YOU ARE. [screaming]
[1:44:52] If you are MAKING ONE SHIELDING
[1:44:55] AND YOU TAKE ONE CENT, GO AND TRY ME
[1:45:00] AND SEE [screaming]
[1:45:02] IF I WILL NOT OPEN THE WINDOWS OF
[1:45:04] HEAVEN,
[1:45:05] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. SO I
[1:45:08] DON'T CARE HOW SMALL YOU MAY BE. I DON'T
[1:45:11] CARE HOW LITTLE THAT YOU HAVE. IF YOU
[1:45:14] APPLY THIS [screaming] LAW, GOD IS GOING
[1:45:17] TO BLESS YOU.
[1:45:19] GOD IS NOT A LIAR.
[1:45:21] IT'S [screaming] IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD TO
[1:45:23] LIE.
[1:45:24] GOD IS THROWING A CHALLENGE.
[1:45:27] HALLELUJAH.
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; BLESSED BE THE NAME of the Lord.
[1:45:31] Hallelujah.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Walking in the steps
[1:45:37] and faith of OUR FATHER ABRAHAM.
[1:45:40] GOD SAID [screaming]
[1:45:42] IF YOU IF YOU BRING YOUR TITHE, IF YOU
[1:45:45] ARE BRINGING YOUR OFFERING,
[1:45:47] [screaming] I GOD WILL GIVE YOU ACCESS
[1:45:53] to heaven.
[1:45:55] I WILL OPEN THE WINDOWS OF HEAVEN. AND
[1:45:58] WHEN I'M BLESSING YOU,
[1:46:01] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; I WILL GIVE YOU BLESSINGS
[1:46:04] AND YOU WILL NOT HAVE enough [screaming]
[1:46:06] room.
[1:46:11] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:46:13] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME TO FULL OBEDIENCE,
[1:46:16] WHEN WE APPLY THAT LAW, [screaming]
[1:46:21] you will see what happened.
[1:46:24] Hallelujah.
[1:46:25] &gt;&gt; I will show you a scripture. Let me just
[1:46:27] put it.
[1:46:31] You know when Abraham
[1:46:34] left his country
[1:46:36] he left almost he didn't come out with
[1:46:39] very great substance
[1:46:44] maybe few animals
[1:46:46] he left the country
[1:46:49] but as he was applying those laws of God
[1:46:53] the Bible says that Abraham was A VERY
[1:46:57] RICH
[1:47:01] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW THAT THERE IS A GOSPEL OF
[1:47:05] PROSPERITY.
[1:47:08] That's what I'm talking about.
[1:47:11] Can we say amen?
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; BUT THERE ARE LAWS IN THE WORD OF GOD
[1:47:15] AND IS SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT YOU.
[1:47:20] [screaming]
[1:47:21] Can we say amen?
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:23] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:24] &gt;&gt; SAY WE ARE LIVING UNDER OUR PRIVILEGES.
[1:47:28] WHEN YOU TAKE A PORTION OF THE WORK
[1:47:32] AND YOU APPLY IT IN [screaming] YOUR
[1:47:34] LIFE, YOU WILL SEE RESULTS.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; God says,
[1:47:43] "I will rebuke the divorce."
[1:47:49] Amen.
[1:47:49] &gt;&gt; Why is he rebuking the divor?
[1:47:54] because you have insured.
[1:47:59] Can you SAY AMEN? IF YOU ARE A FARMER,
[1:48:03] GOD WILL REBUKE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:07] THE THINGS THAT WILL DESTROY YOUR FARM.
[1:48:10] IF YOU ARE A BUSINESSMAN,
[1:48:12] GOD WILL PROTECT YOUR BUSINESS
[1:48:15] BECAUSE YOUR BUSINESS HAVE BEEN INSURED
[1:48:19] BY TITHING AND [screaming] OFFERING.
[1:48:22] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:48:24] BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE LORD. GOD IS
[1:48:26] SAYING
[1:48:29] I [screaming] GOD WILL REBUKE THE
[1:48:31] DEVOURING
[1:48:32] &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SAKE. HALLELUJAH.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; AND HE SHALL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF
[1:48:38] YOUR GROUND.
[1:48:44] Your ground could be anywhere.
[1:48:49] Your ground MAY BE A BUSINESS.
[1:48:52] YOUR ACCOUNT MAY BE YOUR JOB.
[1:48:55] Your account may be whatever you own OR
[1:48:57] YOU ARE DOING.
[1:48:59] ARE we together?
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Can we say amen?
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of THE LORD.
[1:49:04] &gt;&gt; SO WE AS children of God
[1:49:09] you KNOW
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; when God want to do things
[1:49:17] he can do it regardless of the numbers.
[1:49:23] Sometimes it just take one man.
[1:49:28] &gt;&gt; It only took a Moses
[1:49:31] with faith. WHAT IS FAITH?
[1:49:36] Faith is a REVELATION
[1:49:39] of the will of God.
[1:49:43] Faith is a revelation
[1:49:46] the word of God.
[1:49:50] Hallelujah.
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; Then he said
[1:49:57] &gt;&gt; in verse 12,
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; he said 11, I re I rebuke the divor.
[1:50:05] HE SHALL NOT DESTROY THE FRUITS OF YOUR
[1:50:09] NEITHER SHALL YOUR VINE CAST HER FRUIT
[1:50:11] before the time in the field.
[1:50:16] Lord of hosts
[1:50:19] AND ALL NATIONS
[1:50:22] SHALL call you blessed.
[1:50:26] &gt;&gt; You shall be delightsome.
[1:50:29] You shall be a delightsome land.
[1:50:36] When you are obeying the word of God,
[1:50:40] people will see the blessing.
[1:50:43] How are they making it?
[1:50:48] Come on. Come on.
[1:50:49] &gt;&gt; The blessings are there.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; The money that you need for the building
[1:50:54] is there.
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of
[1:51:02] everything is already there.
[1:51:06] [cheering]
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD IS LOOKING FOR SOMEONE
[1:51:10] THAT CAN BREAK INTO THE REALM.
[1:51:14] AMEN. THE CURRENCY THAT YOU NEED IS
[1:51:16] FAITH.
[1:51:19] FAITH IS A CHANNEL
[1:51:21] THAT YOU BREAK INTO. HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; AND BRING THE MONEY
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; AND YOU MANIFEST. HALLELUJAH.
[1:51:30] IT'S ALREADY THERE. [screaming]
[1:51:32] THE BUILDING IS THERE. CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:51:35] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOUR FAITH [screaming] CAN RISE
[1:51:37] TO THE LORD,
[1:51:39] IT DOES. YOU DON'T NEED A MILLIONAIRE
[1:51:41] HERE.
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; [screaming]
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; GOD, YOU DON'T KNOW HOW HE'S GOING TO DO
[1:51:47] IT.
[1:51:48] GOD WANTS YOU TO DO
[1:51:51] BELIEVE HIS WORD.
[1:51:53] APPLY THE LAWS OF GOD. AND WHEN YOU
[1:51:56] APPLY THE WORD OF GOD, [screaming]
[1:51:58] GOD IS A GOD OF MIRACLES.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52:12] Let me bypass some things here.
[1:52:18] Jesus even when he came
[1:52:21] he identified tithing as a part of thing
[1:52:25] a believer does.
[1:52:31] The only problem
[1:52:33] with the Pharisees
[1:52:35] pay putting too much emphasis.
[1:52:41] ON TITHING.
[1:52:43] THEY WERE NOT preaching salvation.
[1:52:51] When Abraham paid tithe to
[1:52:52] &gt;&gt; Melised,
[1:52:55] the priest of the most highc
[1:53:01] did not receive the tithe
[1:53:06] did not refuse the tithe. Sorry.
[1:53:09] He receive it
[1:53:12] because he knew that he was going to
[1:53:14] bless Abraham.
[1:53:18] Tithing is a law of giving.
[1:53:22] It's a law of seed ti.
[1:53:29] When you are paying your tithe,
[1:53:33] you are not paying it to the pastor.
[1:53:36] is God.
[1:53:42] Even if the pastor is a millionaire,
[1:53:47] it's not your business. Can you say
[1:53:49] amen? YOU DO IT SO THAT GOD CAN BLESS
[1:53:52] YOU.
[1:53:54] YOU ARE NOT DOING IT FOR HIM. PEOPLE CAN
[1:53:57] COME WITH THE IDEA SOMETIME
[1:54:00] TO the pastor. I'M MAKING HIM VERY RICH.
[1:54:04] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; You are doing what God told you to do.
[1:54:16] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in Ecclesiastes 11:1,
[1:54:20] "CAST THY BREAD UPON THE WATERS,
[1:54:24] AND THOU SHALT FIND IT AFTER MANY DAYS."
[1:54:31] JESUS SAID in Luke 6:38,
[1:54:35] "KEEP AND IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU
[1:54:40] GOOD MEASURE,
[1:54:42] PRESS,
[1:54:44] SHAKING TOGETHER, RUNNING OVER
[1:54:48] MEN GIVE into your bosom. [screaming]
[1:54:52] And with the same MEASURE
[1:54:55] THAT YOU MET WITH ALL, IT SHALL BE
[1:54:57] MEASURED TO YOU AGAIN.
[1:55:02] ARE WE TOGETHER? JESUS IS SHOWING US A
[1:55:05] LOVE.
[1:55:08] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. DON'T
[1:55:11] ALWAYS BE ON THE RECEIVING END.
[1:55:16] WHEN YOU GIVE,
[1:55:18] IT SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:55:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; THE MORE YOU GIVE, THE MORE GOD WILL
[1:55:28] BLESS YOU. IF YOU GIVE LITTLE, GOD WILL
[1:55:32] BLESS YOU LATER.
[1:55:34] THE MORE YOU GIVE, [screaming] THE MORE
[1:55:35] GOD BLESSES YOU.
[1:55:38] AMEN. IT IS A LAW OF GOD.
[1:55:43] [cheering]
[1:55:43] IT MUST COME TO US BY REVELATION.
[1:55:48] I AM TELLING YOU, MY BROTHERS, MY
[1:55:50] SISTERS,
[1:55:51] IF YOU BELIEVE,
[1:55:54] IF YOU APPLY WHAT I AM TELLING YOU.
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; AMEN. IF JESUS
[1:56:01] AND BY THE NEXT NEXT TIME WHEN I COME,
[1:56:04] SOME OF YOU MAY BE MANAGERS
[1:56:06] [screaming] BLESS SOME OF YOU. GOD WILL
[1:56:08] RAISE YOU. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE THE WORD
[1:56:11] OF THE LORD.
[1:56:14] [cheering and applause]
[1:56:15] LOOK, HALLELUJAH. THIS IS NOT PROSPERITY
[1:56:18] GOSPEL. [screaming]
[1:56:20] WE NEED TO TELL YOU
[1:56:23] [screaming] DON'T TELL YOU
[1:56:26] RUB OFF OF YOUR BLESSING.
[1:56:31] Can I say amen?
[1:56:33] LOOK AT WHAT GOD TOLD JOSHUA.
[1:56:37] HE TOLD JOSHUA. HE SAID, "MY SERVANT
[1:56:40] MOSES IS DEAD."
[1:56:42] CAN YOU SAY AMEN? HE SAID, "BUT WHAT I
[1:56:45] WANT YOU TO DO, THE BOOK OF THE LAW,
[1:56:49] EQUAL THE BOOK OF THE LAW, BECAUSE THESE
[1:56:52] ARE THE LAWS [screaming] OF GOD.
[1:56:55] CAN YOU SAY AMEN, LET IT NOT DEPART FROM
[1:56:57] YOU,
[1:56:59] MEDITATE UPON IT,
[1:57:02] DAY AND NIGHT?" [screaming]
[1:57:04] HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DO THAT, HE SAID YOU WILL
[1:57:08] PROSPER.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO IF YOU WANT PROSPERITY
[1:57:14] SPIRITUALLY, [screaming]
[1:57:15] &gt;&gt; PHYSICALLY,
[1:57:17] MEDITATE UPON THE WORD, MEDITATE UPON
[1:57:20] THE WORD SHALL BE FRESH.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; THE KINGDOM OF GOD AND ALL [screaming]
[1:57:26] OTHER THINGS SHALL BE ADDED UNTO YOU.
[1:57:31] PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD.
[1:57:33] [cheering]
[1:57:35] MAY GOD HELP US.
[1:57:38] G.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; SO THE WORD OF GOD SAYS, "GIVE AND IT
[1:57:43] SHALL BE GIVEN UNTO YOU."
[1:57:48] HALLELUJAH.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes
[1:57:52] we don't know these things.
[1:57:54] I seen when I'm driving sometimes to
[1:58:00] uh maybe somebody want to pass
[1:58:05] and I give them way
[1:58:12] somebody may want to make a left
[1:58:16] you you give them
[1:58:21] when I see when I do that
[1:58:24] when I find myself maybe a day or two in
[1:58:27] the same CONDITION
[1:58:31] and give me
[1:58:35] SAY AMEN. I TAKE NOTE OF THOSE THINGS
[1:58:39] ARE LOSS OF GOD. [screaming]
[1:58:41] HALLELUJAH. THAT IS WHY I'M SAYING DON'T
[1:58:45] BE NEGATIVE.
[1:58:48] Always [screaming] be positive.
[1:58:53] say good THINGS ABOUT YOU.
[1:58:56] WHEN YOU SAY NICE THINGS ABOUT SOMEBODY,
[1:58:59] SOMEBODY WILL SAY GOOD THINGS ABOUT YOU.
[1:59:09] HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[1:59:13] After the flood,
[1:59:17] Noah gave an offering to God.
[1:59:22] And God was so happy
[1:59:26] and he said this to Noah.
[1:59:29] The Bible says in Genesis 8:20,
[1:59:33] "And Noah builded an altar unto the
[1:59:35] Lord,
[1:59:37] and took every clean beast,
[1:59:42] every clean foul,
[1:59:45] offered burnt offerings on earth."
[1:59:51] That was before the Lord.
[1:59:55] Verse 21.
[1:59:57] And the Lord smelled a sweet sav.
[2:00:03] And the Lord said in his heart,
[2:00:06] "I WILL NOT AGAIN CROSS THE GROUND
[2:00:08] ANYMORE FOR THIS.
[2:00:12] FOR THE IMAGINATIONS OF MAN'S HEART IS
[2:00:14] EVIL,
[2:00:18] neither will I against smite anymore
[2:00:20] every living thing
[2:00:23] I have.
[2:00:28] NOAH
[2:00:30] &gt;&gt; GIVEN AN OFFERING TO GOD
[2:00:33] MADE [screaming] GOD
[2:00:35] MAKE A COVENANT.
[2:00:38] HALLELUJAH.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; Are you HEARING ME? SO WHEN WE ARE
[2:00:43] MAKING OFFERINGS
[2:00:45] SOMETIMES WE are overlooking these
[2:00:47] things.
[2:00:51] THAT THESE ARE SPIRITUAL PRINCIPLES.
[2:00:54] [screaming]
[2:00:56] THEN GOD SAID IN VERSE 28, I READ THE
[2:00:58] SCRIPTURE.
[2:01:00] I read it earlier. THEY SAY WHILE THE
[2:01:01] EARTH REMAINTH
[2:01:05] WHEN YOU SOW SEED TIME AND THERE IS
[2:01:08] GOING TO BE A HARVEST time
[2:01:11] he said it will not se
[2:01:16] this ordinance
[2:01:18] WILL REMAIN AS LONG AS THE EARTH REMAIN.
[2:01:23] WHY?
[2:01:25] BECAUSE PROPHET NOAH GAVE GOD AN
[2:01:28] OFFERING
[2:01:30] THAT MADE GOD HAPPY.
[2:01:32] THE BIBLE SAYS GOD WAS HAPPY IN HIS
[2:01:34] HEART. [screaming]
[2:01:36] HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH.
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; WHEN WE COME TO CHURCH,
[2:01:40] WE SHOULD DO THINGS
[2:01:42] THAT WILL PLEASE GOD.
[2:01:45] DO THINGS THAT PLEASES GOD. I WILL SAY
[2:01:48] AMEN. WHEN GOD IS HAPPY,
[2:01:51] GOD WILL BLESS YOU. GOD WILL OPEN DOORS.
[2:01:55] GOD WILL MAKE A [screaming] WAY FOR YOU.
[2:01:57] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. WHATEVER YOU DO IN THE
[2:02:00] HOUSE OF THE LORD, [screaming]
[2:02:02] YOU ARE NOT DOING IT FOR THE PASTOR. YOU
[2:02:04] ARE DOING IT FOR JESUS. YOU ARE DOING IT
[2:02:07] UNTO THE LORD. THE BIBLE SAYS, WHATEVER
[2:02:11] YOU DO, DO IT AS UNTO THE LORD.
[2:02:15] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN. AND WHEN
[2:02:17] YOU SERVE GOD THAT WAY,
[2:02:20] not grudgingly, [screaming]
[2:02:23] AND YOU ARE HAPPY COMING TO CHURCH, YOU
[2:02:26] ARE HAPPY GIVING THE OFFERING.
[2:02:30] IT IS [screaming] AN OFFERING YOU ARE
[2:02:31] GIVING.
[2:02:33] COME AND SAY AMEN. AMEN.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN YOU DO IT WITH ALL
[2:02:36] [screaming] YOUR HEART,
[2:02:38] IT WILL MAKE GOD VERY HAPPY
[2:02:41] IN THE NAME OF THE [screaming] LORD. AND
[2:02:43] GOD WILL SPEAK TO YOU. GOD WILL BEGIN TO
[2:02:45] BLESS YOU.
[2:02:47] TO MAKE
[2:02:49] THE NAME OF THE LORD BE PRAISED.
[2:02:58] &gt;&gt; He said while the earth remainth
[2:03:02] because of this offering Noah has given
[2:03:04] them.
[2:03:06] I will not destroy man again.
[2:03:15] There will be a time to harvest.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; God was even showing now
[2:03:24] the economic systems of the kingdom
[2:03:28] run in the law.
[2:03:35] If we don't have food to eat,
[2:03:39] if there is drought, people will die.
[2:03:42] Yes. If we don't have food to eat,
[2:03:48] if the rain doesn't come on the sea and
[2:03:54] there will be a drought, people will
[2:03:56] die. But God said, "Noah
[2:04:01] has offered this offering
[2:04:04] under inspiration."
[2:04:09] Amen.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; God says
[2:04:17] will not cease.
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; If you want a seed of goodness,
[2:04:27] you have to sow a seed of goodness.
[2:04:33] [cheering and applause]
[2:04:36] That's why there's a law of sewing and
[2:04:38] reaping.
[2:04:43] In the kingdom of God,
[2:04:45] every time you give,
[2:04:47] whether your time,
[2:04:50] coming to church, giving offering,
[2:04:53] giving,
[2:04:54] you are sewing seeds, you are like a
[2:04:56] farmer planting.
[2:05:02] Hallelujah. And
[2:05:05] young brothers, do you know what
[2:05:06] brotherham said?
[2:05:09] He said the way you serve God now.
[2:05:14] It will have an impression upon your
[2:05:16] children.
[2:05:21] Hallelujah. Can we say amen? You don't
[2:05:24] realize
[2:05:27] our actions can be seen.
[2:05:36] When Abraham paid tithe,
[2:05:40] Levi was not there.
[2:05:43] LEVI WAS IN [screaming] THE LOW OF
[2:05:45] ABRAHAM
[2:05:48] FOR THAT ACTION [screaming] OF ABRAHAM
[2:05:52] SAID
[2:05:54] [screaming]
[2:05:58] while he was in the Lord.
[2:06:01] ARE YOU HEARING ME? BE CAREFUL WHAT YOU
[2:06:04] [screaming] DO.
[2:06:05] YOU DO MAY AFFECT YOUR CHILDREN TO COME
[2:06:15] good or bad. [screaming]
[2:06:19] GOD SAID, "YOU WILL VISIT THE INIQUITY
[2:06:24] OF THE PARENTS [screaming] UPON THE
[2:06:27] CHILDREN DOWN TO THE FOURTH GENERATION."
[2:06:32] HALLELUJAH.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:06:33] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THAT? WHAT THE PARENTS HAVE DONE
[2:06:37] IS GOING TO BE VISITED UPON THE CHILDREN
[2:06:40] UPON THEMSELVES. RIGHTEOUSNESS WILL BE
[2:06:43] VISITED.
[2:06:46] HALLELUJAH. EVIL IS ALSO VISITED.
[2:06:49] [screaming]
[2:06:50] ACTIONS ARE SAT.
[2:06:55] Praise the NAME OF THE LORD. MAY GOD
[2:06:58] HELP US.
[2:07:01] [cheering]
[2:07:02] That's right. That's right.
[2:07:05] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 9:6.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; Paul said,
[2:07:14] "But this I say, "He which swearingly
[2:07:21] shall also reap.
[2:07:25] He which swe bountifully
[2:07:28] shall reap also bounty.
[2:07:33] Then he said, "Every man according as he
[2:07:37] purpose in his heart,
[2:07:41] let him give,
[2:07:44] NOT GRUDGINGLY
[2:07:46] OR OF A NECESSITY.
[2:07:49] FOR GOD LOVETH A CHEERFUL GIVER."
[2:07:55] Can we say amen? WHEN YOU ARE GIVING
[2:07:57] SOMETHING TO GOD,
[2:08:00] YOU ARE offering
[2:08:02] something,
[2:08:04] GOD
[2:08:06] wants you FOR HIM TO ACCEPT THAT
[2:08:08] OFFERING
[2:08:11] THAT COME FROM THE HEART.
[2:08:13] CAN I SAY AMEN? YOU ARE RAISING FUNDS.
[2:08:17] You are raising funds
[2:08:19] for the building.
[2:08:22] Think about it.
[2:08:24] Amen.
[2:08:26] &gt;&gt; If that building is built to work,
[2:08:31] &gt;&gt; a sinner come from the street
[2:08:36] and he's saved,
[2:08:38] SOMEBODY IS HEALED,
[2:08:40] SOMEBODY'S DELIVERED. DO YOU KNOW THAT
[2:08:43] THAT WILL BE ATTRIBUTED TO YOU?
[2:08:46] CAN I SAY AMEN? BECAUSE [screaming]
[2:08:48] SOMEBODY SACRIFICED
[2:08:51] AND GOD WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNDONE.
[2:08:53] CAN I SAY AMEN?
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; MAY GOD [screaming] INSPIRE YOU
[2:08:58] TO KNOW THAT WHATEVER YOU ARE DOING,
[2:09:01] THE SACRIFICES THAT YOU ARE MAKING,
[2:09:04] IT IS NOT IN VAIN. GOD IS WATCHING
[2:09:08] EVERYTHING,
[2:09:09] LET [screaming] IT COME FROM YOUR HEART.
[2:09:13] Don't do it.
[2:09:16] HALLELUJAH. [screaming] HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; AND THE MORE YOU DO IT IN THAT now
[2:09:21] sometimes when you ARE SOWING A SEED
[2:09:25] IT DOESN'T COME UP RIGHT AWAY.
[2:09:29] You plant A SEED.
[2:09:31] Sometime it's as if nothing happens.
[2:09:36] CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[2:09:37] &gt;&gt; BUT ONCE YOU HAVE SHOWN THAT SEED
[2:09:39] [screaming]
[2:09:40] UNDER THE GROUND THERE IS A LAW.
[2:09:45] HALLELUJAH.
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A LAW [screaming]
[2:09:48] IN THE SEED. EVEN THE SEED HAS A LAW OF
[2:09:53] LIFE.
[2:09:55] CAN YOU SAY AMEN?
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:56] &gt;&gt; JESUS SAID, "MY WORD IS A SEED."
[2:10:01] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE A SEED OF GOD'S WORD,
[2:10:04] WHEN YOU TAKE A PROMISE OF GOD'S WORD,
[2:10:07] THERE IS A LAW. [screaming]
[2:10:09] THERE ARE BLESSINGS.
[2:10:11] SAY, "AMEN. THERE'S POWER WITHIN OUR
[2:10:14] SEAT. [screaming]
[2:10:15] YOU MAY NOT SEE TODAY. YOU DON'T SEE IT
[2:10:18] TOMORROW BUT AT THE RIGHT TIME
[2:10:22] SEED WILL GERMINATE.
[2:10:24] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming] AMEN. IT BEGIN
[2:10:25] TO GROW.
[2:10:28] PRAISE THE NAME OF THE LORD. THE BIBLE
[2:10:30] SAYS YOUR LABOR IS NOT IN VAIN IN THE
[2:10:34] LORD.
[2:10:42] That shall he also.
[2:10:45] Hallelujah.
[2:10:47] Glor.
[2:10:48] [cheering]
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; May God help us.
[2:10:57] &gt;&gt; God love a charful giver.
[2:11:06] It's not how big the offering is.
[2:11:11] How little it is.
[2:11:14] when they are bringing it.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; I can't preach all of this message. I
[2:11:21] took serious on this subject
[2:11:24] a lot of people.
[2:11:29] May God help us.
[2:11:32] May God give us grace.
[2:11:37] Paul knew these laws
[2:11:40] in Galatians 6:2.
[2:11:43] He said, "BE NOT DECEIVED,
[2:11:46] God is not mocked.
[2:11:48] Whatsoever
[2:11:50] a man seth,
[2:11:53] that shall he also."
[2:11:56] HALLELUJAH.
[2:11:58] &gt;&gt; GOD SAID IN GENESIS 1:11,
[2:12:01] "EVERY SEED
[2:12:04] BRING FORTH of his kind."
[2:12:07] Amen.
[2:12:12] &gt;&gt; God
[2:12:15] &gt;&gt; was speaking to Israel.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; The word of the Lord came to the prophet
[2:12:22] saying, "Is it time for you, oh ye that
[2:12:26] dwell in sealed houses,
[2:12:32] and this house lie waste?
[2:12:39] NOW THEREFORE, THUS SAY THE LORD OF
[2:12:41] HOSTS, CONSIDER YOUR WAYS.
[2:12:47] THAT'S RIGHT.
[2:12:48] &gt;&gt; THE PEOPLE WERE HAVING NICE HOME.
[2:12:53] BUT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD
[2:12:56] WAS NOT TAKEN CARE OF.
[2:12:59] GOD WAS [screaming] SAYING, "YOU HAVE A
[2:13:01] NICE HOME. YOU HAVE GOOD THINGS GOD HAS
[2:13:04] GIVEN TO YOU.
[2:13:06] THEY SAY IS IT IS IT FAIR ENOUGH?
[2:13:10] IS IT FAIR THAT THE HOUSE OF THE LORD
[2:13:12] WILL BE IN THIS KIND OF CONDITION?
[2:13:18] Consider your ways.
[2:13:24] He said you have sown MUCH
[2:13:28] BUT bring in little.
[2:13:32] You eat but you have not enough.
[2:13:36] YOU DRINK, BUT YOU ARE NOT FILLED WITH
[2:13:38] DRINK.
[2:13:40] YOU CLOTHE BUT THERE IS NONE WARM.
[2:13:44] And he that WEDGES
[2:13:47] AND WEDGES TO PUT IT INTO A BAG WITH
[2:13:50] HOLES.
[2:13:56] Are you with me?
[2:13:58] IN OTHER WORDS, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT
[2:14:01] PAYING THEIR OFFERING,
[2:14:04] THEY WERE NOT PAYING THEIR OFFERINGS,
[2:14:06] THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT THE CHURCH
[2:14:07] BUILDING
[2:14:09] WHEN OTHER BROTHERS ARE SACRIFICING.
[2:14:13] You you act smart.
[2:14:16] You act smart. You try to, you know,
[2:14:18] pay.
[2:14:21] Can we SAY AMEN? BUT GOD SEES
[2:14:23] EVERYTHING. [screaming] HE KNOWS WHO IS
[2:14:25] GIVEN.
[2:14:27] JUST EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO. BLESS THE
[2:14:29] NAME OF THE LORD. I SAID GOD IS SAYING
[2:14:32] TO THEM, YOU WORK and work, you get
[2:14:34] money, but the money will just
[2:14:39] when you get your money,
[2:14:41] &gt;&gt; it's just like you have money and you
[2:14:43] put it in a pocket or bag that has
[2:14:46] holes.
[2:14:50] You know when you obey the word of God,
[2:14:54] God say was saying even to Israel, he
[2:14:56] rebuke the devil
[2:15:02] diseases
[2:15:03] that was should have struck you
[2:15:06] that will make you to GO TO HOSPITAL
[2:15:09] AND SPEND THOUSANDS OF YEARS
[2:15:12] WILL NOT COME UPON YOU.
[2:15:15] HALLELUJAH. CAN WE SAY AMEN?
[2:15:18] &gt;&gt; GOD WILL [screaming] WATCH OVER YOUR
[2:15:19] HOUSE. GOD WILL WATCH OVER YOUR
[2:15:22] BUSINESS.
[2:15:23] GOD WILL WATCH OVER YOUR CHILDREN.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. [screaming]
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:15:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN SURE.
[2:15:34] HALLELUJAH. AMEN. BUT THESE PEOPLE SAY
[2:15:39] you you make you you THINK WORK YOU MAKE
[2:15:41] A LOT OF SALARY BUT YOU don't know where
[2:15:43] THE MONEY GOES AT THE END OF THE DAY.
[2:15:48] SO GOD IS REPEATING HIMSELF. GOD SAID,
[2:15:51] "THE LORD OF HOST,
[2:15:54] CONSIDER YOUR WAYS,
[2:15:56] GO UP TO THE MOUNTAIN,
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; BRING WOOD,
[2:16:01] AND BUILD A HOUSE,
[2:16:03] AND I WILL TAKE PLEASURE IN IT,
[2:16:07] AND I WILL BE GLORIFIED, SAY THE LORD."
[2:16:11] CAN I SAY, "AMEN."

[2:17:27] THEREFORE, THE HEAVEN OVER YOU

[2:38:14] Lord Jesus,
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; it's it's the narrow way,
[2:38:19] but it's your way.
[2:38:21] We know that Lord, all those that are in
[2:38:25] you can never be lost.
[2:38:28] But Lord, many of us live under
[2:38:31] privilege
[2:38:34] for all the blessings that you have
[2:38:37] prepared for us. Many times, Lord, we
[2:38:40] want to be receivers and not givers.
[2:38:45] Lord, we are saved. We are going to
[2:38:47] heaven. But many of us, Lord, remain
[2:38:51] bound in these things.
[2:38:56] And we remain beggy.
[2:39:00] We remain expecting others to give to
[2:39:02] us,
[2:39:04] expecting others to make it for us. The
[2:39:07] Lord told us tonight, the God of Abraham
[2:39:10] is our God.
[2:39:12] We are sons of Abraham by faith and the
[2:39:15] blessing of Abraham must be applied to
[2:39:17] us also.
[2:39:19] We claim it tonight in the name of Jesus
[2:39:22] Christ. Help us Lord to walk in that.
[2:39:26] Give us the revelation Lord. For faith
[2:39:28] is a revelation of your will
[2:39:31] and Lord your ways and your will
[2:39:35] never change. But many times Lord we
[2:39:38] lose focus on
[2:39:41] impress these things upon each heart
[2:39:46] these principles
[2:39:48] of your word
[2:39:51] took a surrendered heart all the way
[2:39:53] from New York.
[2:39:57] He sacrificed a lot to be here
[2:40:02] just for us to hear this
[2:40:04] and there is more for us on Saturday.
[2:40:08] Take the man of God and re kindle that
[2:40:11] fire in him
[2:40:15] renew his strength and let all all of us
[2:40:18] and and others who are not here Lord
[2:40:20] come back
[2:40:23] more expectant.
[2:40:25] Lord desire us to hear from you Lord.
[2:40:28] Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord.
[2:40:31] We ask your blessing upon the
[2:40:33] congregation now
[2:40:35] even as we will dismiss shortly Lord.
[2:40:38] Father bless everyone and even now as we
[2:40:41] are going to practice what we have heard
[2:40:45] by giving our offerings and tithes Lord.
[2:40:49] Bless every giver that we give.
[2:40:51] Apply your word upon them. Lord
[2:40:54] be with us as we shall go to our homes.
[2:40:58] Give us a wonderful week,
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; wonderful weekend in the name of Jesus
[2:41:03] Christ.
[2:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; Say amen.
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:41:10] Amen. Before we give our offerings and
[2:41:12] dismiss,
[2:41:14] I just wanted to uh maybe you can have
[2:41:16] your seats for just a moment.
[2:41:19] Just wanted to uh give a few
[2:41:21] announcements.
[2:41:23] Uh but how many appreciate the word we
[2:41:25] have had tonight?
[2:41:28] Amen. Amen. It looks like you've been uh
[2:41:32] listening to everything we've been
[2:41:33] talking about over the past several
[2:41:35] months.
[2:41:39] That can only be God.
[2:41:41] Isn't it interesting when you hear
[2:41:43] someone else come say what your pastor
[2:41:45] has been saying but in a different even
[2:41:47] in a better way?
[2:41:54] that has been a very big encouragement
[2:41:56] to me.
[2:41:58] Amen.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; You know, there's a service I have
[2:42:00] someone I preached on sewing uh the
[2:42:03] principle of sewing.
[2:42:07] And after I preached it, I was like, did
[2:42:09] I just preach that?
[2:42:12] I had to just send it to a few friends
[2:42:13] to ask them, please check it and tell me
[2:42:15] if I'm still in the message.
[2:42:20] But if I had had this sermon tonight,
[2:42:24] I would not have asked anybody about it.
[2:42:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:29] &gt;&gt; Do we say amen to what we have heard
[2:42:30] again?
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, tomorrow is Christmas
[2:42:37] and uh so I know um many have already
[2:42:39] traveled and maybe others would want to
[2:42:41] go with their families and what have
[2:42:43] you.
[2:42:45] But I just wanted to remind you
[2:42:48] that as you plan to be with your family,
[2:42:50] biological family,
[2:42:53] we also have a family
[2:42:56] &gt;&gt; of believers.
[2:42:58] Some of us really when we came into the
[2:43:00] message
[2:43:02] the family of believers became more of
[2:43:05] our family than the other family.
[2:43:10] you want to spend much of the holidays
[2:43:14] with the believers and so we don't have
[2:43:17] a church program for tomorrow
[2:43:21] but uh I'll have pastor Simon at my
[2:43:24] house tomorrow
[2:43:27] and so I've not invited anyone
[2:43:30] and unless if you are uh you know you
[2:43:33] know family member
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; allow us also to share that and the rest
[2:43:38] of you can also share with your
[2:43:43] I think you can say amen to that. But I
[2:43:46] appreciate those have already received
[2:43:48] some Christmas gifts.
[2:43:52] It's been lovely to those of you who did
[2:43:53] that. God bless you.
[2:43:56] We certainly appreciate you very very
[2:43:57] much.
[2:43:59] And um but on on sat on Friday
[2:44:03] early very early in the morning
[2:44:06] we are planning to drive to Sono.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; There's a convention there. Uh pastor
[2:44:13] Makoba has been in uh in Pastor Simon's
[2:44:16] church several times.
[2:44:21] Where is charity? Charity
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; right over here.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; So that's your friend's daughter.
[2:44:29] So uh we will be you know pastor Makob
[2:44:32] has invited us to go and you know it was
[2:44:35] these things were not planned really
[2:44:38] so but we we'll just go there and in at
[2:44:41] least a meeting or two
[2:44:44] where we will have our brother preach
[2:44:46] there
[2:44:48] and then we we drive back immediately.
[2:44:52] You see all those sacrifices
[2:44:55] all for you
[2:44:56] because we're planning for him to be
[2:44:58] here on the weekend.
[2:45:01] Otherwise, they would have been very
[2:45:02] happy having him there the whole time.
[2:45:08] He was even invited to be in the
[2:45:11] meetings in which he could not make
[2:45:16] because of the meetings in Karamoja
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; but also because of you. Imagine. Think
[2:45:22] about it.
[2:45:23] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So, so you really want to be here
[2:45:26] and on time.
[2:45:28] &gt;&gt; And so, uh, Friday will be in Sorco.
[2:45:32] Then on Saturday, we're going to be here
[2:45:34] at the church,
[2:45:36] um, with the ministers and their wives
[2:45:44] and also those who don't have wives.
[2:45:47] If you know you're a minister in this
[2:45:49] church,
[2:45:51] uh, and those of you who are not here,
[2:45:53] you are streaming, please make sure you
[2:45:57] no matter where you are,
[2:45:59] come and be here.
[2:46:02] And when I say ministers, I don't mean
[2:46:04] only the preachers,
[2:46:07] you know. I mean even those ministering
[2:46:08] in other departments,
[2:46:12] those serving as deacons and you know uh
[2:46:15] media department and music department
[2:46:17] and all those departments
[2:46:19] uh Sunday school all of you come and be
[2:46:22] and of course the preachers as well uh
[2:46:25] because you see when we have ministry
[2:46:26] come through like uh pastor Simon
[2:46:28] Peterimon
[2:46:33] is uh you want to tap from
[2:46:36] you want to tap
[2:46:38] So that's why I do things like that and
[2:46:41] that service will not be streamed.
[2:46:44] If you minister and you don't make it,
[2:46:45] you will miss.
[2:46:47] Then on Sunday morning, we will be here.
[2:46:52] So for Saturday
[2:46:54] because we are going to be traveling
[2:46:55] from Sorco and we'll be tired
[2:46:58] for the ministers. We will not do Sunday
[2:47:00] morning.
[2:47:03] We will do it at around um I guess about
[2:47:06] 2 p.m.
[2:47:09] Yeah, that uh 2 p.m. I think
[2:47:12] um we will communicate on the on the
[2:47:14] group to see
[2:47:16] if you want to put it a bit earlier with
[2:47:20] then on Sunday morning we will all be
[2:47:23] here.
[2:47:25] Uh don't come alone.
[2:47:27] Uh I know last Sunday I was told that
[2:47:29] and I know there are very many who were
[2:47:31] not here.
[2:47:34] But I was told that uh if there was one
[2:47:36] more person, the chairs were not going
[2:47:38] to be enough.
[2:47:42] &gt;&gt; So uh there's a a sister among us here
[2:47:47] who pledged to buy chairs for the
[2:47:49] church.
[2:47:51] So you have had a sermon on giving
[2:47:53] tonight.
[2:47:55] So I hope that God you you would want to
[2:47:58] ask for more blessings
[2:48:02] for more chairs or maybe there's someone
[2:48:03] else who want to take
[2:48:07] you know when you talk about giving not
[2:48:09] many amens come
[2:48:12] especially when it's the pastors talking
[2:48:14] about
[2:48:17] when you have a a visiting minister talk
[2:48:19] about everybody says amen
[2:48:22] but we say amen anyhow.
[2:48:25] And uh so Sunday morning we'll be here
[2:48:27] at usual 10 a.m.
[2:48:31] Please keep time. We want to give the
[2:48:34] word as much time as possible.
[2:48:38] Really as the pastor was preaching I I
[2:48:40] thought to myself I wish we had a Sunday
[2:48:42] up evening but then we have already
[2:48:44] given it to another church.
[2:48:51] How many thought it would have been
[2:48:52] lovely to have a Sunday evening?
[2:48:56] So you come early in the morning. Let's
[2:48:59] utilize our Sunday morning very well
[2:49:03] and Sunday evening he'll be preaching
[2:49:04] over at Pastor Bima's
[2:49:08] and uh you know so we want to be there
[2:49:11] Sunday evening.
[2:49:13] Lastly 31st I know we did not announce
[2:49:17] this early
[2:49:20] but I told you I gave you a heads up. I
