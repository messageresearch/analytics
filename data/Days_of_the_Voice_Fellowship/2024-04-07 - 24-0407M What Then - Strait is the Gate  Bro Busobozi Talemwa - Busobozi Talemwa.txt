smiling I'm happy to see nice to see your smiles in the house of God so we should let all the pressure go we should relax in his presence is that amen uh there's a one brother from with us this can I see you I think this is Brother CB's little brother yes yes uh brother calb told me about you a certain Institute the name of that Institute okay he just close he will be fellowshipping here while he's at the and uh he he was he was first of all you know greeting The church here his name is brother Joshua and uh he told me a lot of things but I just read a few he says um I've been following your preachings online and they have been a blessing to me both from the conventions and also the DV Uganda I really enjoy and get blessed by the meetings he he said also recently I listened to the sermon you preached about approach to marriage and it really was a big eye opener sermon to me and I have been sharing that link of of of that preaching to friends to listen to it even this evening actually but almost a month ago I I listened to it and uh he says I wrote many notes out of that and there are some things you were just saying like directly to me and he said I appreciate you for that someon so you also wrote a lot of other things here he's a graduate from uh I think Kenyata University and uh he in Nairobi at this at this time so this young man asked me to greet you and I thought it was wonderful to you know hear we usually from time to time hear from many uh especially the young people you know from sometimes from the usya South Africa Europe from many countries around the world and we are happy if we can be a blessing to you know even if it is one person and that is why we do stream our services because you know we were not told to uh Minister only to one locality Jesus told us to go all over the world and and nowadays even easier with internet and there's another young man who also I heard from take the time to read the messages but you know he gave me the testimony on how he received the H and it all started in the youth meetings year and you know how God is using him now there's a prophecy that was given to our brother at the end of the meetings but the brother said when I heard that as I was hearing that I knew that God was speaking to me directly and he said you know he did not even know but later on he realized that God had called him into the ministry if you're going to influence one person to to go into the ministry I believe that is a big deal why because you know one person is going to destroy many demons praise the name of so the Lord is good and many who also sent their greetings where I have been I was in Ethiopia we had one service with the Saints there pastoras sent his greetings in the name of Jesus Christ and also many other believers me to greet you also we were in a place called I don't know whether it is called or or whatever it in Switzerland and we had wonderful meetings there we were able to be in six meetings and uh we fellowshipped with about I don't know how many pastors could be about um more than 20 about 30 you know from all over the world others Came From Italy other came from you know many many areas in you know in the UK others in Germany others in you know many many places in the in the Europe in Europe but also in in the US uh there is this brother I've actually never said it publicly but I think I would say here uh one time I was in Nairobi and I had gone there for the purpose of you know of course ministering but also uh meeting a few Brothers to speak to them regarding uh my burden for Ethiopia that we had served with them in Ethiopia and specifically I desired for them to stand with us because I had this burden to go in the Northern areas of Ethiopia where there is completely no church and it's very dangerous to go to because they had recently been war and I did not know how that was going to happen I did not know how we were going to translate those messages in that language but just as soon as I had you know stepped in my hotel room I received a communication from someone I did not know and he told me you do not know me but I'm brother so and so another brother so and so gave me a contact and I have a burden for Ethiopia and he told me that you are the man to talk to the person who gave you my contact is from Zimbabwe and the brother was from the USA said I'd like to support translation in in the in Ethiopia and so I told him you don't know but I'm I'm in a place right now where I've been praying and I'm even here to meet Brothers regarding Ethiopia at that very moment God was already moving on someone from far away so for the first time we had an opportunity to meet with this brother in Switzerland now for the first time we sat down and talked about how he got the burden and he told me you know um my senior pastor you know he I was having a burden for Ethiopia and I was praying about it and then when I went to meet him he much older but he asked me what are you doing what are we doing for ethopia so you can see that God was moving on many people I tell you what if the work is of God God provides and uh and so that brother we met with him he's a wonderful Minister and actually now I tell you so you can pray I've invited him to minister in um to be one of our speakers for our next come Mee is one of those that has been a blessing to you know the bride all over the world let's pray over that and see will lead and so Brother David mayor sent you greetings he was the host for those meetings and several other brothers brother Tom Ray also sent greetings is a is a pastor in Canada and um um several other brothers that met with us and they asked me to greet the church so receive their [Music] greetings amen like I said it was not difficult for me to you know blend in with the people I was I was so surprised at how many people were already following our meting many of them will hear this probably just love the bride all over the world Amen sometime you will go in heaven someone will tap on you and say I know you I've seen you somewhere I've never seen you will tell you where and you'll be surprised you know some people you know some brothers some brothers and sisters never met I was thinking how heaven will be it will be wonderful it will be wonderful let us stand on our feet just read the word of God this morning I've heard the uh the land fund contrib like to say God bless you all that are contri andly after the service I want to hold you for a few minutes so I can talk to you about that a little for now let's just go I not be so long in the word this morning so I can give time to speak to you a little bit after the service Matthew 7: 13 we are reading up to verses 14 just 13 and 14 M so I'm horse this morning but I trust that uh maybe brother Dixon you need to give me a little more I think you put it down you need to put it up a little bit so that enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the gate and Broad is the way that leadth to destruction and many there be which uh go in there at okay now that sounds better because straight is the gate and narrow is the way which leadth unto life and few there be that find it you may be seated I'm speaking to you on a thought of what then straight is the gate but what then and um in the scripture here Jesus Christ speaks and he says enter ye in at the Straight Gate for wide is the G and Broad is the way that lead us to destruction now we have a tendency that many people believe in things because there are many people that follow you and because many people follow something then it kind of justifies it to be true so because in your church 5,000 people 10,000 people come to your church because of that you feel comfortable that you are following the truth there is a a quote that one of our sisters I think sister phbe posted on her on her group yesterday and I it really moved me and it found me you know having this Evangelistic anointing on this weekend and I loved it she said when a preacher becomes a motivational speaker the congregation [Music] becomes and I think that is true today we have more motivational speakers than preachers are we hearing what I'm saying church is not a place where we come to feel good though when we hear the word of God it makes us to feel good church is not even a place where we come to make money you know some people think that they ought not to work but they have to just go to church and pray for miracles of money every we make money in the marketplace but we come to church to come closer to God you have come here this morning because you desire to come closer to God now if you have come here for any other reason I want you to know that you are in the wrong place we come to church so that we can see how closer we can get to God not how we can build our house how we canes or how we can get married or things like that all good and it has their place in the word of God we come to church not to hear a motivational speaker we do not come here to be encouraged even we come here to be rebuked we come here to be corrected we come here to be brought closer to God now the Bible says the word of God is a two-edged SW and when it is cutting it's not only cutting you it's the pre it is even possible for a preacher to preach and at the end of the day go to hell so it's not about whether someone can preach or not you know there are many the Bible even says that we'll come to him on that day and they say Lord Lord and we do you know bring many to you in your name we heal the sick in your name we prayed for the you know we brought many solders in your name and he he did not say you did not do those things but he said go away from me and he gave the reason he said you doers of iniquity Now what is iniquity iniquity is knowing the word of God you decide to despise it and decide to put it aside and you take your understanding and you lean on your wisdom rather than leaning on the word of God but there is a a seed of God on Earth that will always hear the word and receive the word will always hear the word and be and when you hear the word you don't you don't want to put a to it when you hear the word you want to receive it wrong amen you want to receive it the way it is amen you don't want to hear the word and say I don't want that and then he walk away from the word amen how many will hear the word and receive it one accept even when the preacher is preaching the word amen he too needs to align with that word every one of us need the word of God there's no one who will outgrow the word say that me I have been preaching for so long that have come to a place where the word of God is just under me the word of God is above everyone and that's why in all the enti message churches all over the world we prioritize the word the word more than the man amen can you say Amen to that amen we believe in the word more than the man but we know it is the by the man the word comes because God cannot bypass man and then bring the word he brings the word by the word or by the voice of the man now you as a human being you need to come to a place where you look or you hear beyond the voice of the man and you hear the voice of God for you this morning you will hear either the voice of God or the word of God my the word of God I don't know about you but I want to hear the voice and he says Jesus said enter ye in a the St for white is the gate and Broad is the way so many people always go where the majority go and you know but it is the opposite with God it is the opposite with God every time you have the majority more of them are nonbelievers no more of them most of them are usually and our Prophet told us that there are three kinds of believer the first category is the real Believers the second is the me Believers the third are the nonbeliever and they are all in the same Church of Jesus Christ they will always be there they will always be there the real believer and the make believer you see the difference is the real believer will hear the word and accept the word be convicted by the word be changed by the word before they get changed they will grown within themselves they will yearn to be like the wife the unbeliever the believer behave as if they believe we try to even leave like the word deep in their heart no seed of God in there take that word and believe that word and so we see like Kan did not have that se gen of God in you know he even tried to be to hear what God was saying but he did not really hear it he did not really accept it can you imagine God came down to hear and he said Kan if you do good you be accepted but what did Kan answer Kan behaved as if he answered but he turned around and he went and killed his that mother spirit that spirit that a kills your brother did you know that even to speak against your brother speak against your sister you are murdering them how many knew that how many knew that you did not know that you speak against somebody your brother you are killing that and we see that Cain mured his brother and he turned around and he came back in the church and he sat down and when God was preaching was saying amen but that day his godness had fallen he said where is your brother My Brother's Keeper my own man and I minding my own business let me tell you the way of God when you are walking in it you will have a Gentle Spirit you have a spirit that loves others so many people want to go where the majority go and it's not easy to follow after the narrow way usually the way that is right is followed by a few usually the truth is believed by a few usually the majority are always wrong I know sometimes there are certain times we make a vote in the church but I'll tell you something brother usually the majority are always wrong the minority are always right because why God works in the minority I prove that in just a moment we find that in the Bible when the 12 disciple you you know Judas betro Jesus you know he he he told him you know when you know he died and the disciples came together and they said let us choose among ourselves another disciple I'm sure they must have looked for somebody who was closer to them closer to their [Music] thinking the understanding of closer to everything but what do you see that he did Maus did you even know that that was his name some of you didn't even know his but you know he did not do so much but what did God do chose Paul and Paul was amen could not be chosen by he could not even when God chose him and he sent him to go and be baptized you know he feared to go he said what if they kill me who was going to kill you who was he afraid of the soal believer the so people who are following God they were the ones who could not choose him and when you feel like you are the worst of the worst then you always the choice of God because God came for the work God came for the sinners praise the name of the Lord and so he went to the disciples and he feared even to go among them even went and stayed with them for just while and then he left and he went to the desert alone and he he swe it out CRI it out it out until God moved with there's something I'm trying to bring to you that if you're going to make a decision to follow Jesus Christ you have to accept to be in the minority it's not always easy to follow the narrow way it's necessar leaving things behind it makes you unud the will of God is always difficult everybody will disagree with you even in the decisions you make in your own private life you many times you realize when it is the will of God not many will agree with you but always this is the way of life a prophet in the message audible says I now see you become an audible sure enough to the world but I don't let that bother you don't let that bother you now you say how do I know I am threaded right the word now you know whether you are threaded right whether we are nuts for Christ or whether we are the nuts nuts for the world I don't know whether you want to call that nutty find better word yes okay fine whatever you want to say whether you are an old boy whether you a foolish man for Christ foolish man for the world you see friend you that is listening to me this morning I want you to understand that you cannot live in this world the way just you yourself being led by nothing that nobody leads them nobody guides them they still Guided by that spirit that makes them believe that you you are either led by Christ or you are led by the world spirit that is in the world and if you are led by the spirit of God you will bow to this world if you are led by the spirit of the world you will bow to the things of the world whose servant are you are you serving Christ the word or you are serving the world many people always want Mix us God always is looking for separator I realize when I believe the message in the beginning I had to make deliberate moves separate myself from some of the things that I love so dear there's one thing that I really love and that was my Bishop because you see he was a real good man and and you know he helped me in life and he did so much for me but you see the things he believed it was against the word of God Amen and the Bible says in the year that died I saw the Lord who is your mine was that but who what is it that is so big that you feel you cannot separate from what is it there is much more than you think you need to separate yourself you cannot serve God and mmon tell your neighbor you tell them you cannot serve God and M you cannot serve God and M you have to leave the other and serve one you cannot have two masters in your life sacrifice the other master and remain with because you were born for a purpose and that purpose was to live for God but you see here he says job the things that I feared worse is come upon me you want to be above everything where there is no condemnation nothing to you you you got to live like real Christians live in the presence of God you have to live daily live hourly live Mally say nothing do nothing go nowhere Let It Be Christ like everything you do all your God requires us absolutely to abstain from all things of the world separation the world wants mixers the world is looking for mixers but God is looking for separators the world is looking for mixup you see even on weddings they wanted you know us Amen to go and play the worldly music let me tell you we are separators we are not mixers he says everywhere you go amen do nothing nothing live daily hourly moment in other words every time of your life I am not a Believer only in church I am a believer in church I a Believer out of church i a even when I'm having a party my party is also a party of a Believer who told you that when you are having a party and because you are having worldly people over your party then you should not play for them their things because you want to mingle and mix with them so they can be happy but when we go to their they play our music they don't want to mix with us they don't like us they don't like what we like therefore if they come to our par we should not mix with them they should come feed on what we feed on when they come to our W they should listen to our music I'm not hearing any amen this morning when they come to our whether it is a b party a celebration party anniversary W to you young people planning to do weddings if you're planning to do worldly music don't invite me I will not come if I come and you do it I will walk out why because we are not mixed up separat we are supposed to draw a line whereby the world is the other side amen and we are on the other hand God is looking for separat people who will be genuine Believers you don't dress like a Believer church out there you dress like a a worldly person you be a believer Everywhere You Are God is looking for separators but the world wants mixer my God they will go down to the beach and you know all there what are you talking are you saying that believer should never have fun well I'll have fun as long as my f is within the confence of the and how will I know the spirit of God is sent into my heart to remind me everything that is in the word he will lead you into all truth and then you put on those are they called B and then you go on the beach everybody there and you to you are there you are half naked and saying you a Believer half naked before the whole world wait a moment are you telling me that men don't last at the beach what do the scripture say that he that shall look at a woman to last after her has [Music] committed with her already in his so both of you have committed imagine a virgin girl walking on that day and behind you is a line of men that you have sinned or been immoral with and yet you have never done anything wrong in that picture but you presented yourself that [Music] way you did not keep your virtues I believe friend that as as as children of God as true believers of the God we have to show ourself different we have to be separators God has never looked for a mixer God has never been a mixer God has always been a separator and God has always called for total separation from unbelief amen and so he says they will go down to the beach and have ay in the basement B in the church let me tell you God want separator who will separate men and women from sin listen it condemns praise the name of the Lord God want separators tell your neighbor God want separate prise God Amen you know you go for a social drink go for rejoicing with your friends and this and that you are not supposed to be there you don't have to business to be in those kind of things you are royal pries amen you are different you are special to God you need to be like a amen those three boys when they brought them before the table of the king and they told them come on here is the table and they saw the meat there they knew that these people had killed this meat in a way that was not accepted by the word maybe it was also meat which was maybe not accepted in the word at the time and they said we will not eat meat here King will respect you but we shall not have any meat said but you will look bad you will not look good said we don't care and he said here we we want to want to put a challenge give us GRE us I don't know how long it was said let us see by the end of this season how we shall look compared to those who have [Music] been we need to put a challenge to the devil our food is different our food is the word our behavior is different our lifestyle is different let us see if we live by the word if we will not be even better than they that don't Hallelujah am amen if they would take bright refuse to take of the Bri I said refuse the bride and say you will be poor tell them let us watch the SP let us watch the SP we are not mix up we are separat let us see who will be better by the end of the year let us see who will be better by the end of this season the season you are in is not is changing you don't need to mix with the world to be blessed by God you need to separate and is always difficult especially when you are younger and having to live in a community where everybody doesn't see things the way you see and they begin to look you at you different they begin to look at you an audible they begin to look at you as a foolish person as somebody who is beside himself someone who who is brainwashed someone who has lost their mind but friend if you not ready to Amen to appear like that to them then you are ashamed of Christ amen but I want to be amen like what was written in the Bible said I am not ashamed I am not ashamed Paul wrot to Romans I am not ashamed of the Gospel I am not ashamed how many here can say the same I am not ashamed of the goel I am not ashamed of the Gospel tell two people I am not ashamed of the goel I am not ashamed of the gopel what is the gospel it is the power of God to Salvation amen amen the Greek Jew the UG and ethopians to all that believe the gopel the word is the power am not ashamed to identify myself with the believer Hallelujah if everyone at your workplace dress as a minister makes up and paints their lips put their earrings don't be ashamed to say I don't believe in that they ask you why don't you do that some of you you can't even testify that they will even bring you a gift makeup kit because they think you don't have the money to buy and that's why you're not using it oh what a shame let me tell you must be able to stand and this is what I believe so that everybody will know you have a stand let me tell you we in a generation that is losing the backbone whereby people are fearing to stand for what they believe don't fear to stand for what you believe everybody is fearful don't be careful if you don't believe in fornication you don't believe in for if they begin to talk about and laugh at people and they laugh at them and then I can't say any word here because if I do I will be an audible what a shame you have to be ready to be an you have to be ready then usually people who say I can't judge I can't be a judge such people are also victims are you hearing me they victims they are silent victims so they a part of what is going on that's why they can't judge but the Bible tells us we shall judge even the angels and how much more the small things and small matters in our M we cannot judge those who are without but we can judge those who are within the ones who are without we are sent to be Witnesses so why does God want why does God separate us so he can make us ready for the Rapture he is separating us so that he can prepare a church without spot without wrinkle so he can M his character in us oh friend amen God wants to make you special God wants to mold you God wants to work on you and he wants to remove you from the crowd and set you aside so he can begin to work on you accept being separated if you are not separated how then can he work on you know I have several children and so when I have something special I want to give to one of them tell to one of them I will not tell it to them when everybody else is there I'll just come and pick them out of The Crow and take them in the bedroom and now my other children are usually wife so when they realize one of them is missing they run to find where they are because they are suspicious might be [Music] giving and they always right so if for example I picked one and then came and she finds the things is already done she will tough and ask the sister what did he tell you what did tell because she didn't want to miss let me tell you friends this is how God does for he he he he wants to pick us from the crowd because we are special he picks us out of the crowd because he loves us and he takes us in a place he begin to tell us Secrets things thats know nothing about he went when he was on Earth and he spoke to the people and he told them things everybody had Parables he went to the own his own he picked them out he took them in the secret room and began telling them the explanation of the parable Hallelujah until one day Peter came realized Jesus had what we call here socialism God and he told Jesus today I want you to tell me why do you always separate and you separate us from the others tell us deeper things why do you always tell us why do you always tell us not themus I believe he was so happy with Hallelujah and he said to him because to them it is not given all the Mysteries all the Mysteries to you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God because we are the bride because we the seed of God us we are given to know Mysteries of the world but to the world they are not given to know don't Marvel God separates you [Music] from want to give you Revelation he wants to amen hallelujah hallelujah he wants to lift you in a place say I am seated with him in Heavenly places how can you be seated with him you are seated with the world it cannot be you have to be seated with him after separating yourself from the world when the world begin jokes walk away from that kind offf don't join them in their because you are different you are special you are not like the world you are a child of God hallelujah Ephesians 5 that he might sanctify and the washing of the that he might present it to himself a glorious Church Oh Glory God he wants you to be a glorious oh my smile to somebody tell them he wants you to be a glorious CH glorious chch glory to God hallelujah not having sport not having wrinkles or any such thing that it should be holy and without blish us to be separated the Old Testament he separated two tribes two groups of people amen they were special they were called special they were anointed special one of them was Kings they were supposed to be rulers oh are you hearing me this morning and the other were are priests there were supposed to be servants in the temple to and now in the New Testament we have said for us Believers in Jesus Christ we are both Kings PR in other words we are supposed to be rulers supposed to rule over sin we supposed to rule over our Temptation we supposed to rule over the world the world is supposed to be below us and we are supposed to be on top of it we will be tempted like them but we shall rule over that temp we will be drawn into the things like them we shall overcome why because we are king and then he also says we are priest holy holy unto the Lord we going to manifest that Holiness the Holiness of the word it's not going to be a law it's going to be the life of Jesus Christ Living in us and so that's why he wants us to be separated and separated so Genesis 12 let me show you an example here verse 1 to 5 and I told you I won't be so long this morning so I'll finish in a few moments so you better enjoy the word while it lasts now the Lord had said unto Abraham get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee this is verse [Music] [Music] 11 and I will make of thee a great nation and I bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing praise the name of the Lord and I bless them that bless thee and C him that c thee and in thee shall all the families of the earth be blessed so Abraham departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and went with him Abraham was 7 years old when he departed out of her and Abraham took SAR his wife his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and saw that they had gotten in Haron and they went forth to go in the land of Canan the land of Canan they came now before we continue here to read this other qu that I have here let us go through a little bit of this scripture he says the Lord said un AB get thee out of thy country and out of kind and from thy Father's House praise God did you see those three things we all need to go through them one get out of your country all right which country are we from Uganda so we do things like Uganda get out of your country if your country is get out of your country it doesn't matter what your country is get out of your country and it's good to be to love your country Naturally Speaking humanly speaking I'm one person who really loves ug I even Marvel at people who live Uganda to go and live in other countries because when you go to those countries you don't see anything that they have that is better than Uganda in the sense that it will make you leave Uganda to stay [Music] people say money but then what is money you can make money anywhere you I believe if you are blessed by God doesn't matter where you are you can make money those who believe that say amen and quite frankly I will say I've not seen a country as beautiful as you and I'm honest you all the countries have been to so far Uganda is the most and you know by the time the prophet died wanted to come to Uganda and I know he spoke very well about Canada and you know about you know the the you know the mountains and green and you know the trees everything how he hunted there many times but I think he had not come to Uganda he had come to Uganda would have loved Uganda Uganda is beautiful I this weather is beautiful when when you are here it can be hot but not so hot it can be cold mean Uganda is the best you know has the best WEA that I have seen know debate with brother Prince on that you thought but but you know Uganda has the best weather and so you talk about UGA many things you can talk about you talk about the food you know we have organic food SP with all these you know artificial things you talk about the people I think there are good people here and land and everything you know but above all those things now he's saying you have to leave your country because the prophet said that every every country has its own spirit so you go to every country you'll see that they have a spirit about you know and and and you know if you don't if you misunderstand you think they mean to be bad but their nature their Spirit the spirit of their country you know people have come here and have committed about ug here you know it's because the speed of the country whenever Kenyans come here they have a tendency of saying ugand a little bit slow and when we go there we always say you're so fast Russ because in Kenya somebody lives in Nairobi you cannot get a of them they're just so busy very busy even when some of them are doing nothing they just and here in Uganda even when someone is supposed to be doing a lot they just take their time they always slowful sometimes I get sick of because why why is someone slow the spirit of the country when it rains in Uganda people don't go to church I can see didn't come here because it looked like it would rain just look like it would rain and they they didn't come to chch in the spe of the country you know but in Nairobi whether it RS or not you find people walking very early in the morning going to work Spirit of the country in China almost God is money you know many people have told me we believe I believe in myself you can talk with them if you're talking money if you're talking business things even then in that country and in this country and in Kenya and in every country there are believers have accepted to leave their country hallelujah praise God you find in in you know first you know like Canada Europe they don't believe in having a lot of children many die without even having a child have time for and then if they have maybe one child but you see the Believers of this message they have children some of them even pray for God to give them a child when they can't have a child and I actually met one brother name he told me have a child but he prayed it's a long story but very powerful testimony prayed and God gave him a child and he showed me that child she's a beautiful young lady and I tell you what God is into the business of providing Miracles if you in need of one you one this morning hallelujah amen amen so if you leave your country if in your country if they corrupt you don't have to be corrupt like know in Uganda well the Bible tells you to leave your country if someone says come on you don't know how they do it here I'm not from here I'm from above Hallelujah there are some institutions where they don't institutions organizations whereby they don't ask you for Bri directly they just tell you behave like a ug ug they trying to say things move with you know a police off stops you and he how are you and you know I always say no I'm sorry I'm not where are you from I'm from above Hallelujah you realize your language is different so if you're ugan you can't you will speak Ugandan language you from above you can't speak the same language with them and God told Abraham Abraham leave your country Hallelujah and he also told him leave your kind oh my God some people love their [Music] kind am don't play with me don't with me you they would speak me I'm a lure we are from above because we are been told leave your kind go beyond the C go beyond the C your desire should be different we are Christians we are children of God we are not of Our Own Kind oh my goodness Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah in Europe there is something I saw there I know this is public somebody could see no problem truth I saw a lot of racism there from a lot of you know restes different rest and things but among the Believers you could meet somebody and you just see there like a baby and then they just give you that big warm heart God bless you mean they have left their kind they have left their kind they have gone beyond the C we do need to go beyond the car we need to stop thinking like Thea and that's why we have a problem even in marriages we have a big problem people don't let go of their traditions and someone ask me past Traditions wrong I said Traditions are not wrong where they contradict with the word they become wrong because we must not bow to traditions of as long as they contradict with the tradition of the praise the name of the Lord my my my well I know there are people who go overboard I want we because I'm very spiritual praise God so we need to be balanced somehow then we see here we need to leave our kind we need to go beyond the we need to stop [Music] [Music] being you know kind of things let me tell you friends we are beyond that of this message be we should never be tribalistic never do that and I thank God because I think 0% of you or maybe 1% of you know my TR even if you think you know it I will tell you you don't know it you were wrong because I believe those tribes don't matter when it comes to spiritual things we are of another tribe what our Tri isy kind we came from above we go back above we came from go back to God separate from our country don't think like your tribes men think like your your culture don't think like your Tri no think like a son or daughter of God for us they told us oh shame on you if you shame on you for us we are not we are Christians and a Christian a Christian let me tell you will and then you will face it but I don't care what his Tri or is as long as she's the holy ghost child of God I don't what yes and from my and also separate from your father's house some people are very proud of their fathers my father my father he didn't do that so I have to do this my father failed here so I have to pass here my father who is your father and some of you begin to walk in the failures of your father and you admit it because you think it's your father my father was a very angry man so I'm sorry if I'm angry that's where I picked it from oh Father all right but as far as I'm concerned God holds for separators separate from your father I have another father my father is God my father is Jesus Christ amen DNA flow through my ve I want to be like my father I'm another song to be like Jesus to be like Jesus [Applause] all through journey to be like because he's my father amen now he said here amen get yourself out of your country get yourself out of your country separate from your father's house I have a l i will show you glory to God am I have a l i show you a he will show you a he will show you that land is Flowing with blessings he said here I will make VI a great nation my God the nation begins with you the begins with you the nation begins with me I'll make a great nation who believes that you believe it receive it receive it Hallelujah I will make you a great nation are you hearing me my God this is powerful I will make you a great nation meaning if you are not I will make God has the power he has the ability only believe I will make you a great na not only that I Will Bless Thee I will make your name great and you will be a blessing Oh Glory to God he doesn't stop there he says I will bless them that bless you and I will C them that c you and in thee shall all the families of the Earth bless hallelujah oh glory to God can we take this out of the written word can we this morning for our I want you to speak those words and propes upon yourself put the words up here everyone prophesy upon yourself he says I will make I will make you a great nation amen you will make me a great say it upon yourself you will make me a great nation you will bless me you will make my name great I will be a blessing amen you will bless them that bless me you will cast them that in Me In Me In me all the amen I say amen I believe that is what happen those who separate themselves hallelujah amen so Abraham departed sister don't linger don't stay there very long from your Tri your country from your friends departed and the Lord spoken you oh my depart I feel like to stay there little longer in lug that's a good one you can't do it you departed youart I think sometimes we need to make put our Fai into action sometimes I wonder when the prophet of God came down would have simply said child resurrect but he had to put actions there he put his mouth on his sometimes action speak that we have faith if you depart don't remain seated let me tell you I don't usually do this just beened some of you who have been cled in a place but after hearing what I've preached to you you feel you are going to depart from where you to separate yourself I want you to do one thing I want you to depart walk away from your sin and come [Applause] back amen AB departed listen to this prophecy while you are walking step you are walking theep the blessings of God your life amen God Is Lifting you up don't you this is already departing another face God is moving you I am my worries I'm from my sickness I'm from my evil ways oh come for one minute I'm I'm and the Lord SP spoken him while you departing for a few moments don't depart with Lord your lord behind this is the problem Abraham man when he departed he departed with don't depart with your lord something else that you love don't depart with your lord don't depart with your habit oh God help us listen to what he says down here then when Abraham's Lord with each other lot was already backing in his heart and he went toward Sodom and you know the end of him Abram as soon as he had done what God told him to do separate himself from his kind and everything now you say what about Sarah and sah are one you and your wife are one I don't want you to hear I don't want to hear people saying I departed Pastor from your wife don't depart from your wife don't depart from your husband you and your wife are one but now Sarah was in the Covenant with him because she was the wife but notice when he separated himself amen from Lord and Lord's wife I imagine Mrs Lord wanted to belong to all the lotteries and everything going along through the country so she was a Hance to [Music] him and the Bible said let us lay every that when we in this let us lay aside lay aside every lay aside every way don't accept to carry a w you're not supposed to car lay aside every way lay aside the malice lay aside the L lay aside L aside immorality aside everything and let us run with patience the that is set before [Music] us looking unto Jesus our notice when he got separated from Lord what did God appear to him then again after he separated himself and done what God told him to do then God come to him and when God tells you to do anything you would better go and do it or you might not see him no more for a while do what God tells you to that's your next move is it's your next move to obey goded is better than sacrifice then when he got himself separated from Lord then God appear to him and said Abraham you made a nice choice you you you told Lord to take his choice and Lord went down towards Sodom because all the big times down there oh my they had all kinds of Gams and wres and big times at night did you hear that inom they had all big times at night I Marvel at Christians who are night hkers night H I call them there specific Birds we have but I'll tell you there is one specific bir that does not travel at night there are many but there is this one specific one will never travel at night it is called a d within it there is no gu within it there's no gu it's perfect that's why we type it with the Holy Ghost I tell you a Believer who has the Holy Ghost will not be a night H night hkers there's a who likes traveling at night it's called a it's very active when darkness comes when comes down it's even blind it can't but when darkness comes let's go I hope we don't have BS [Music] here and if you a b then separate yourself from the B and God will have on you and put a dve in your hand now I don't want people to live and say well if you are if you feel I you it means you change your ways this is for you change your ways separate from the dark separate from being you know in Sodom down there all the big times at now and I blessed to watch television been such a thing and all everything you know and just take it easy that's the way people like to go with the Waters of least resistance you know this water is not so this is easy like you are going to live here forever you are not none of us is going to live here forever and because of that knowledge that should only make us feel we need to do something out of the ordinary we need to prepare for eternity and I read you the last quote here what then I just read this and then conclude after pin your spiritual being my dear brother pinch your spiritual being my dear pinch come and see what I'm reading are you in the spirit brother very well all right he said pinch your spiritual being my dear brother people just gave it to you over my dear brother your soul as it was with prayer and say Lord Jesus check up on me let me take inventory tonight before I go to bed and find out what's the matter with me I've been professing for years and I don't see these things that Jesus say that he would be with me and things would go on I don't say what's the matter Lord Jesus listen be honest come down and talk to him as face to face with a brother by the way the problem we have with this generation is people are no longer sincere and that's a big problem you see when in the Bible when men of God sinned they F they put that thing right they never came again before the presence of but we have generation that doesn't care we leave any do and they still call themselves but he says be sincere come down and talk to him face to face as face to face with a he will reveal to you he will tell you tear your soul apart and you will lay it out there say Lord Jesus if it cost me my f if it cost me my life if it cost me my job if it cost me my membership if it cost my prestig in the city I will take the way with the Lord is now remember Jesus said straight is the gate and narrow is the way and few there be for broad is the way that leads to destruction a Millions more now 2024 is the G that lead and many be find it that's right he that will lose his life for my sake shall find it he that loves his father mother father brother anything better than me is not worth it he will put his hand on a plow and start forward even turn to look back is not worthy of the [Music] time one of these days the last Holy Ghost anointed gospel sermon will be preached imagining you know we are used to coming to church and hearing a [Music] good sometimes we happy you know we're dancing but that's all okay but the purpose of the preaching of the Gospel is that we might be brought in the presence of God and might be made [Music] ready but one of these day the last seron will be pre one of this days the last gun fire will fight one of these days the last song will be one of these days the last prayer will be praying one of these days the doors of the church will be closed for the last time this is true the Bible will be closed on the pulpit I come I open it I close other preachers do the same one of these days the Bible will be closed for the last time and you will stand in the presence of God to give an account for what you have had what then what then when the book is open when tonight [Music] comes oh the song says what then when the Great book is open what the ones that rejected the Savior today will be as to give a reason imagine standing before the [Music] judge do you know the savior is the same judge and you will stand before you and if you rejected what I told you if youed what you've been hearing you'll be asked a question why did you reject it would you have a reason my family my country my tradition my what then your job stood in your way your parents stood in your way your boyfriend stood in your way your in your way your church what then what when the Great book is open what when the ones rejecting this message tonight you are going to be asked to give a reason what are you going to do about it you know what the mark of the beast is you know what the Seal of God is the prophet of God says it's up to you sometimes I've come up here and preached sermons and I've always tried to preach Inspirations and I never want to preach situations and sometimes I even ask myself Lord why did you inspire me to preach and there are times that I feel so bad after the [Music] service oh God I think i' read that service [Music] but those are the moments that you know people come to me and tell me my life was on a stram and that was for me I never forget one day when you know Sister contacted me from the UK she said this girl she was going to commit suicide but because she had one service God saved her saw and I've had many testimonies from the congregation many times you know people come up and tell me that was for me now while we are standing I want you to close your eyes for just a moment and think about what you have because it was an inspiration that I received from God I believe it has been for a purpose and somebody needed it if you be that person I ask you a question what then when you get there before him what will you answer what will you say when the world has been presented to you you've had everything over and over over over and over until it stopped even making sense but remember there is a day you're going to stand before him and you be asked I will be asked all of us will be asked to give an what do you do when that word was presented before what is your lord tonight that you feel you cannot separate from these things that are you know heavy lad to you this excess weight why don't you just say Lord I want to submit myself in your presence that you will help me to let this go you
