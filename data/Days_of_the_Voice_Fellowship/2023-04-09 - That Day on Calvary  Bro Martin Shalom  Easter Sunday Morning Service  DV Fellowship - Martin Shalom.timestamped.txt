[1:49:52] and they just sympathize with him
[1:49:56] look they're beating him

[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:53:10] they could not find anybody on Earth
[1:53:17] no one could pay for our sins
[1:53:22] but one day
[1:53:24] blessed with the name of the Lord your
[1:53:28] sin did not start on Earth
[1:53:37] sin started in heaven
[1:53:39] Guru Lucifer Lucifer the devil was
[1:53:43] condemned creature
[1:53:46] for Disobedience for his Disobedience
[1:53:50] before he ever strike before he ever
[1:53:53] strike the Earth
[1:53:55] sin begins in heaven
[1:53:58] where God put the angels and so forth
[1:54:00] upon the same basis that he put human
[1:54:03] beings
[1:54:08] they were supposed to decide by
[1:54:11] themselves
[1:54:12] who they will support
[1:54:15] you see that's how how simple our God is
[1:54:22] and there was a requirement for sin
[1:54:26] the requirement was death each one is
[1:54:34] that we could go into greatest detail of
[1:54:39] this because I do not believe that there
[1:54:41] is but one death
[1:55:04] [Applause]
[1:55:15] [Music]
[1:55:41] spoken word is original remember
[1:55:54] he preached a message called Saturn is
[1:56:01] but before that
[1:56:03] when Adam was in Eden Adam
[1:56:06] he says agama
[1:56:09] Adam could communicate with even animals
[1:56:20] God created
[1:56:22] and Adam gives them Adam and when God
[1:56:26] called Adams
[1:56:31] he service
[1:56:35] it came moving and then God maybe God
[1:56:39] will sit at someone
[1:56:50] he looked at it
[1:56:52] and he said big news
[1:57:08] because Adam was
[1:57:13] then God showed them another box
[1:57:16] pure white
[1:57:21] name
[1:57:23] say that one will be a crane
[1:57:31] among others and others cows and other
[1:57:35] animals in somewhere
[1:57:39] he said that Adam
[1:57:45] he
[1:57:49] was the Master of the
[1:57:53] of the camera because sin came on us
[1:57:57] shall be the name of the Lord but here
[1:58:00] you say that when sin strike the Earth
[1:58:05] in the beginning like a black that like
[1:58:08] like a sheet of Blackness falling from
[1:58:10] Heaven foreign

[1:59:06] [Music]
[1:59:37] therefore when man realized that he was
[1:59:39] separated from God
