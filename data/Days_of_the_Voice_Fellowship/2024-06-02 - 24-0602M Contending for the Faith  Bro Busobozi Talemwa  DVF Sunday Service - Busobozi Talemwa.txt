God and our Lord Jesus Christ Amen Let us speak to the Lord once again father Lord I'm overwhelmed I'm overwhelmed knowing that I do not have the ability to speak to your people in my own I therefore need your help may you give me utterance may you give my brother Grace to interpret and may you all give all of us Grace to hear give us a good atmosphere where we can sit down in the quietness of the spirit and hear what the spirit has to say to the church Lord bless each of us everyone under the sound of my voice even some who are not here physically but connecting with us by the way of live streaming father may you bless them and may may by the end of the day May we say that Lord has visited Us in Jesus name amen please be seated so um usually when uh I'm preaching I desire that um not only when I'm preaching but when every preacher is preaching really I desire that every oh I'm happy to see brother Andrew instead of leaning over you could even have a a seat CLA this side amen or there's one there which is you know you can see clearly if if you are in a place where you're not comfortable you can always ask the Deacon to Lo put you to another place of the you you should be as comfortable as possible so that you can hear the word very well and that's what I was going to say that I always desire that we don't make movements because really a typical Ministry or ministering would take uh here usually at the Church 1 hour to 1 hour and a half and I believe that every every adult can really sit during the whole time unless you are unexpectant mother we used to be told when we first believe that when you come to church and um you know you begin with prayer you consecrate yourself you don't just move around outside and then you stay in the church the whole time if you feel your pressed and you need to go to the place of convenience you try to do that shortly before the preacher begins so that you don't miss any word so that you stay within under the um preaching of the word throughout and after the word you don't quickly go out you wait and you water the word which you have and then now you can go out I believe all of us can do that but sometimes some of you when they preach things that are difficult for you to understand or to believe you feel frustrated and you are like let me first go out and the pressure no don't do that let the word be fully into you amen amen I watched a I watched a Street Preacher who walked into a taxi some of you have watched that clip and he said we come to your homes and you run away you bring pangas to cut us we come to the streets and you run away from us now I'm here in the taxi and we are in Jam no one is going to go the whole word is going to go in and I felt that was nice let the word be ful to you hallelujah amen I have something which I believe will help the church the Believers today and please even you who are operating the media Department please don't be over concentrating on that and then you miss out May God minister to all of us so it is 8 minutes to 12 so by 1 130 I'll be done I'm giving you that timeline so that you can focus amen everybody fine so I'm going to speak on contending for the faith and um here Jude the brother of James would write these words and he says uh to the Believers that when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exort you that you should honestly contend for the faith now not any faith he's not even talking about faith here is talking about the faith so now the faith is one which all the others before us had but Faith every each individual can have faith or can have a level of Faith small big but when it talks about the faith talking about the foundation he's talking about what we stand for what we believe he talking about our faith as Believers as Christians there is only one true faith in the world and then the others are all false and that true faith is what was brought in the world by Jesus Christ and was spread to the whole world by the disciples by the apostles now that is called the faith the people that have that the faith they are the ones called The Church there are many churches all over the world there are many faiths around the world many denominations around the world but there is one true faith and one true church the one true church is planted on the one true faith and today I'm speaking about containing for the faith the faith which was delivered to the disciples and which the apostles prayed all over the world and we will read it also in the Amplified version where it expounds the words and makes it more clear for us it it says excuse me please he says beloved while I was making every effort to write you about our common salvation I was compelled to write to you urgently appealing that you fight strous for the defense of the faith we hallelujah how many believer we have today you should fight stly why do we have to fight it means we are going to have opposition is to OPP praise the name of the Lord so we have to fight strenuously for the defense of the faith which was once for all handed down to the Saints the faith that is the sum of listen the the faith that is the sum of Christian belief uhuh yes yes yes yes you brought it very well the faith that is the sum of of Christian belief that was given verbally to the Believers are you hearing so these things that I'm talking about were given verb to the Believers by the apostles first by Jesus to the apostles and then the apostles they spread it all over the world many of them wrote books writing to other believers about these things I'm talking about today those things they wrote we have it in the form of the Bible but the Bible is a collection of beliefs is a collection of of of teachings of what the Believers the first original Believers stood for what the first Believers stood on what they believed what they practiced what they taught what they spread all over the world all those things are right here and and and this man here Jude is telling us I exal you that you should honestly urgently I'm appealing you I'm appealing that you fight strous for the defense of the faith which was for all handed down to the Saints for for certain now why does he say that here's the reason why for certain people have crept in unnoticed just as if they were sneaking by a side door you know when when you have a house and someone walks into your house unnoticed and then you know you you get scared when you see him in the house how did you enter now the Bible is saying there are many men who sneaked in and they came in our church brother they came in our faith the Christian faith they sneaked in unawares they are ungodly persons whose condemnation was predicted long ago for they distort the grace of God into the and immoral Freedom viewing it as an opportunity to do whatever they want they don't only stop there but they also deny and they own our only master and Lord Jesus Christ now I want you to listen to me carefully today today I this this is the kind of sermon that goes down to what we believe so only say Amen when you believe what I'm saying the Lord anointed his disciples and lay the foundation of our faith the laid the foundation the Lord anointed them and they laid Foundation the devil though did not want to stay that way so he also anointed some men to s a wrong s of his the devil's false teachings now the true church is to honestly contend for the original faith because there was a wrong seed that was SW after the right seed was swn there was also a wrong seed that was swn today we have twins twins in the Christian church and actually our Prophet says there will be twins in every Revival there has been twins in every Revival and even in in the Church of Jesus today we have twins we have a can and we have an Abel are you following me we notice that one will will contend for the original faith and another one will not will have another idea will have explanation we have reasoning we have other things but the true original Believers the True Vine they will contend for the original Faith now we have the false Vine and we have the True Vine we have the false church and we have the true church but you see it is very difficult to Now understand which is which and the Bible says it will be continually difficult until the time of the Harvest do you know we are now at the time of the harest we have arrived we at the time of the Harvest where the wheat will be taken into the Ghana and the wrong seed will be taken for burning oh I will get to that later amen the seeds will go together side by side it will be very difficult the Bible talks about the other Spirits the spirit of the Antichrist the spirit which is against the word which is against Christ he says will be it it will be very to the to the extent it will deceive the very elect it doesn't stop there many I have heard a preacher saying some elect will be deceived we thank God for the prophet of Our Generation because he has told us the elect cannot be deceived Hallelujah did you hear that the elect cannot be deceived your neighbor the can be let that sink in tell another nebor on the other side the the El cannot be deceived why because the elect is predestinated unto life the seed of God remains he cannot be deceived so the Bible says to the extent it will deceive the very El if it were possible if it were possible the very fact that there is an if there it means is not possible it is not possible amen hallelujah hallelujah amen no matter what false doctrines come I am the elect of God I cannot be deceived that's why let me tell you let me tell you brother Sam I can actually bring a Catholic priest here and give him a microphone you remember we had an anglian priest here didn't I give him a microphone whatever he says whatever he preaches whatever he sings can it deceive you can it deceive you we are not afraid we are not afraid of false teaching there are some people who close their ears because they are afraid to be deceived but let me tell you you cannot fear a sickness if you are vaccinated now we the Believers of this enti message we have received the vaccination amen this message is a vaccination we have the antidot we cannot be deceived amen we are we are on the foundation that is solid we are on the foundation that is established we are on the foundation amen Jesus Christ the word we can never be deceived we know who we are amen and so now we notice those two seeds are in the church in the framework of Christianity and the the the other spirit is very cunning it looks so much like the truth but it is not the truth Matthew 13 let us go to the parable of the S we used to read these Parables or they used to read them for us in the Anglican church but really they do not have the Revelation but now under the revelation of the message we can understand the depth of the mystery vers 24 praise God and another Parable put him forth unto them saying the Kingdom of Heaven is likened unto a man which slded good seed in his field but while man slept his enemy came and sowed tears among the wheat and and went his way and went his way but when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also so the Servants of the householder came and said unto him sir did not thou s good seed in the field from whence then has it tears he said unto them an enemy has done this the servant said unto him Willl thou then that we go and gather them up but he said nay lest while ye gather up the tears he root up also the wheat with them let both grow together until the Harvest and in the time of harvest I will say to the Reapers Gather ye together fast the tears and bind them up in and bur and and bandles in and to burn them but gather the wheat into my Bur for yes [Music] [Music] amen praise the name of the Lord I think that is better brother Dixon so now we see here uh he speaks this Parable has a lot has a lot in it he says the Kingdom of Heaven is likened UN to a man which sold good seed in his field Who is the man that sold good seed in hisory that is the master of the Harvest that is Jesus Christ he came down from heaven and he sold good seed can we say Amen to that and what is the field the field is our hearts amen he saw the word the word of life because the Tree of Life himself amen but while men s who are these men who are these workers these are the laborers in the field of this great Master of the Harvest when this man came down from heaven the owner of the field he picked 12 men that he gave the the the instruction to go in in the whole world and plant seed to go in the whole world and preach the gospel to Every Creature what is the seed which was sold the seed which was sold was the word was the seed the word is the seed of life the spoken word is the Original Seed so we see that when these men the 12 disciples rather they became 11 eventually when these 11 men you know they planted seeds rather he had planted seed the master and the 11 men the workers who were with him the original Believers when they slept everybody tell someone when they slept when they slept what sleeping is this he's talking about dying in the flesh when Paul died Peter Sil all these brothers James and John and Matthew when they died when they slept the enemy came and he also saw tears among the we the wheat was already planted the seed was already planted but when the man the disciples died the the wrong seed also was planted to the church ages the church ages amen started with the age of Ephesus Ephesus was a generation that was we know it to be uh you know an age where the word was still pure and God still had many disciples alive at that time Paul was actually the messenger to the to the Ephesians Church Ag and um and you know they preach the word with all Purity they laid the foundations of the faith they were Fierce they were ready to to to be killed for what they believe they said what we are preaching we did not learn it from man is wisdom but we heard it from the spirit one of them said what we are telling you is what we saw what we heard the Savior was with us we at with him we walked with him and these things are written here they said it so it is not something that is coming from the Moon there are men who were here on Earth and God used them to lay the foundation and the truth was planted the true seed of the word pled and and but but but we see that you know 300 years later after the death of the last Apostle they established their wrong Doctrine sin cancer but remember before it was a Doctrine it was a deed it was some men who had come up at that time who were resisting the truth and they wanted men to look at them more than to look at the word if you read carefully the Bible says in the Book of Revelation 26 that at that time they had the Deeds of the nians and and and and and you know God said I hate it Ephesus was the first church age it was the beginning of the dispensation and God said they had these Deeds among them remember it had not become a Doctrine yet there were just these men were beginning to come in sneaking into the church bringing their false ideas bringing their doctrines ands but it had not yet been organized but you see as the ages progressed as time went on you know we realize later on you know that in the age of pegamos you see he says Thou Hast also them that hold the doctrine of the [Music] niol now the did had become a doctr are you following me the the rumors had not been established what the devil had planted in Ephesus it had now been established by the age of p and it had been EST it was established established this is where the Throne of the devil was this is when they when they enthroned a man and they said this man represents God when was there ever a time in this Bible here when there was one man representing God on Earth please answer me church do you read it in your Bible it is nowhere to be found 3 years 325 years later that's when the did became a Doctrine and these men the Romans they invited all the Bishops and they brought them to this place called and they decided to have a meeting they walk coun and the council had a purpose the purpose was to unify the church because of course at that time we did not have the book called The Bible at that time we had different books written by different disciples that many different Believers had you find some Believers in Corinth they had the book of Corinth others in ephes they had their you find you go to another place you find the book of Timothy and others had the book of Fon other now these books were all different but when these men came up they said let us t let us have one world religion and let us choose among ourselves a man that will be the one representing God on Earth and we shall now name him our Pope and have power like God is power on Earth and that's when they began changing now doctrines because we shall find out later on here as I will read for you shortly that the doctrines of the Nicol were established at that time men having control over the church they no longer had the Holy Ghost controlling the church but now it became men they changed their doctrines from what the apostles originally Tau to what they now believe are you following me are you following me all right now I know I'm giving a lot of information here but sometimes we need a little bit of church history to be able to understand what we believe so now we see here that when Apostle Paul came Paul knew what he believe what Paul preached is the same thing that Peter preached it was not separate it was not different and after Paul preached what he preached he came up here and he said something or maybe I can read for you this later on let me first read this quote for you praise the name of the Lord in The Message Church the Ephesian Church H please follow me I'm going to do a little bit of reading scriptures and a few so just listen and and try to process everything a little fast okay so the true vineed the foral Deeds of the nians so did God what was this deeds in the Ephesian [Music] Church in the Church of the Ephesians they became or rather the Church of the pegamos it became a Doctrine in ephesius the first church it was a deed in the next Church it a doctr can you hear it can you understand it now it was a deed in the Ephesus Church watch over here in pamos it becomes a to those of you who don't know what I'm reading these things are in Revelation Chapter 2 you you can find it there so it just started here a little baby in a little baby form now in a minute we are going to find out what that was now here is Paul's wolves here is Paul's wall Paul's wolves the Wolves he was warning people about beware of wolves they come in ships clothing but they wolves you see they come to tear to tear the flock he says what was those wolves it was the Deeds of the nans now let's break that word down okay niol come from the word which means to conquer or to overthrow niol overthrow or to conquer the lady Ru you when isolute what he says is the Absol you cannot that is the spirit of n the spirit which rules he makes you go away from the leadership the leadership of the put you under the leadership of man are you hearing me now we realize that this was a deed in the beginning the people had the word but you see there was those people who also wanted to win them over to themselves now N means to overthrow or con all the people the congregation the Believers what they were trying to do here was trying to take the church where God had pastors no God had pastors God also had the spirit of God moving by gifts in the Church of the Living God and they were having a started that they were going to have some priests some Bishops and some pops and so forth so you see now God's plan sister listen has always been to have a church a church a triumphant Church an overcoming Church a church that is going in the rupture but do you know how God leads that church God leads that church with a fivefold Ministry and the word because the fivefold ministri are not laed by themselves listen closely the pastors the teachers the apostles the prophets the Evangelist they don't come to tell you their own mind when I'm here I am not telling you my mind if I'm telling you my mind then we are another religion but what is the work of the fivefold ministry is to lead the Church of God but how would they lead the church they Le it by two things everybody said two things they will lead the church by the word by the word don't be like those ones who wait when someone says you're going to get a Visa then they begin shouting when they hear Miracle is on the way even those ones who were doing the jum they get spared off by what men tell them but for us our men our preachers our pastors they give us the word and it is the word that excites us let me tell you if the word doesn't excite you have something wrong if you feel when you are hearing the word you get bored there is a problem with you you need to receive the Holy Spirit if you feel bored by the word I said there is a problem with you but the true genuine believer will never be bored by the word hallelujah hallu as a matter of fact when the word of God is being preached you can't sit so flat in your chair you know the word is being preached and you are dozing until you fall down there's a problem with your experience when the word is being preached you need to you to be like the man I saw when he was watching football he couldn't see still how many saw that man social media yeah I can see some of you saw him it is true as he was watching he couldn't sit still he was like that's how you have to be when you are eating the work you sit on the edge of your chair you want to hear com come on come on come on when the picture stops to drink some water you can't wait please come on come on that is how we have to be because it is the word that gives us excitement hallelujah amen so the preachers of God will lead people by the word number one number two by the Holy Spirit God uses the word and the Holy Spirit to lead his true church Hallelujah the word alone is not enough we need the power of the holy spirit because the word is the mechanics but the power of the holy spirit is the Dynamics the holy spirit is the power the word the word and the Holy Spirit is inter together glory to God and when the Holy Spirit is in the church you will see the gifts being manifested you will see tongues being spoken you will hear interpretation of Tong you will see preachers preaching under the anointing of the Holy Ghost you will see someone singing a song and leading people into tears hallelujah what is that is the power of the Holy Spirit you will see someone playing the piano amen that's the mechanics but the power of the Holy Ghost will come upon him and when he begins to play even he himself will be lost in his presence that is what we need that is what we need can you shout amen oh Hallelujah am in the Church of brother Bram one sister they were singing a song and one sister went into the spirit The Pianist oh we want pianist that are spiritual we want dram that are spiritual we want that are spiritual we want spiritual musician that we will enter the spirit when we are entering into it Hallelujah and this sister as she was playing she entered the spirit and as she went into the spirit she stopped playing and she began jumping and worshiping God and when she did that the Holy Spirit has fingers Hallelujah am the Holy Spirit came in the church and began playing that piano this happened friends the piano continued playing the song was the great physic now is here that is the God we believe in Hallelujah am but many times when the Holy Spirit falls down upon us you hear some people who know the person that was eating their mucus they know the person that f and how they fell they know even how their body was exposed they know everything those people are in are kind of people they don't they can't enter the spirit but God is looking for men and women who will worship Him in spirit in spirit but also in Truth where will you find those people they are not in the Catholic Catholic movement they not in the angc movement they're not in the Pentecostal movement where are those people those are the Bible Believers the Believers of this message of the hour hallelujah amen what we are in is more than a movement what we have received is God himself restoring to us those things which the devil came and sto the church right so now that God said he hated theed of he it yet today to overcome to overthrow the lady the lady is the church how many knows the lady is the church to overthrow to conquer or to take place of to take the place of the lady in other words take all the sacredness all of the power from the church and put it over on the priest it is only the man of God who can pray for you it's only the man of God who can C demons it's only the man of God that is Holy is only the man of God that ideology is the spirit of the niol we are liberated we are set free in the message of the hour it is the late the People You Are Holy you are the people of God the power rest within you the same power that raised Christ from the dead that same power is in me that same power is in you you too can pray for the sick the Bible says the sign shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out demons they shall lay their hands on the he did not say only the pastor he did not say only the prophet he did not say only the Evangelist but every believer all of you say I have that power hallelujah amen but the spirit of Nichol takes that power take that Authority that sacredness away from the church and puts it in a few men taking the Holy Ghost away from the people with signs and wonders following them and they take that away and they give them a holy priesthood we are the holy priesthood oh hallelujah hallelujah woo amen when the Roman Catholic Church began they would say you are not allowed to read the scriptures you are not holy enough who is Holy the priest and they would say you have to go to the Holy One the priest and confess your sins father I have sinned what have you done my my child I've sto I sto what did you Ste this I saw the chicken of my neighbor oh my son what else have you done I also lied I also let me remember I also I also was tempted to do other things what is it and then you will explain everything all right you remember now this time last time I told you 20 now I'm telling you to to now beat yourself 50 stroke and also on top of that you go and pray ha Mary times with your pastor are you not talking against another religion some men crept in way is it a crime to talk about them we are going to talk about they have not only stopped in Catholicism come on up into pcis you find them especially women that ones who are always overtaken by these things Pastor I have this thing disturbing I can't get married this man came he went this came he went don't worry my daughter I'm going to deliver you yes I need deliverance and you are getting some of these young ladies in the message to they also looking for deliverance if you need Deliverance go in your prayer closes receive the holy ghost seek for the Holy Spirit until you are filled in your heart if you not filled with your with the Holy Spirit the Deliverance you seek you never get it no man can deliver you only God can and we see they go there and before you know it the man of God is telling them you know I need to deliver you and you know I need to anoint you and I need to anoint your all body and then I pray over you and then I pray over you Pastor Prophet what kind of prayer is this and the women are deceived because they think the man of God is the one with the anointing I want him to touch me I want him when when he touches listen we have been delivered from that Spirit ofis there is no one man with power or anointing all of you have the power and anointing Hallelujah we have it because the Bible says we are a royal priesthood all of us as long as you believe this sign shall follow them but the spirit of nanism has taken away that power that signs and wonders they are giving to a people a dead God that only they have the power to awake but God we serve each of us he can hear us we don't need a mediator we don't need a mediator our mediator is Jesus Christ Our mediator is the Holy Ghost we don't need an Arch Bishop we don't need a pop amen our Arch Bishop amen is Jesus Christ he said is the bishop of our soul that's what the message has done it has delivered us and now we are contending for the original taking away the Holy Ghost and swapping it priesthood you see what it was it finally became in the church here it was deeds and then in this place became a doctr in pamos and in it took over is the dominating female AG that's when we find the Roman Catholic Church took over the whole world and that's why you you wonder why we have Catholicism as the biggest religion in the world they had even an army which would kill you physically because they had the power of the state you resented the church because they say that there was the true church and that Spirit took over the whole world and when Luther came out could and stay that way it went right back and took over again Bishops Cardinals Arch Bishops who in this who in the world world is the head of God's Church they ask you what who is the head of your church you even find someone asking us so where do you Fellowship from you tell them days of the voice Fellowship ah who is your who is the head where is your head Church where we Fellowship from no I mean they want they want your headquarters our headquarters today let me compose myself let me announce to you my our headquarters today our headquarters is in heaven amen hallelujah amen our Arch Bishop is Jesus Christ and also He's our Bishop hallelujah amen hallelujah amen that's who we are We Are The Bride of Jesus Christ and if you resent that tell me where the head was you tell me it was Jerusalem no it was not Jerusalem it was Heaven amen hallelujah hallelujah the Holy Ghost was sent to rule the church not just the preacher the whole congregation just the preacher behold no all the church has the Holy Ghost and you find in some of these churches they will be led by gifts you find gifts controlling the Church no sir gifts don't control the church the word controls the church and Gifts only come to edify the body gifts come to support to to to to to edify to inspire to build up to encourage it's like eating water without eating food without water if you eat water the word if you eat food the word if you eat food without water you will have constipation if you eat so much of the word without the holy spirit Power you will be spiritually constipated we need the spirit of God some people sit in the church me I know so much of the word I'm so full of the word that I can't even cry anymore that me I sit like an officer when the word is going on you know me I'm not like these little babies I understand the word I know the Seven Seals I know the trumpets I know the 7 of I know everything in the message I understand the Bible very well what are you telling me so you preach let the young people Rejoice let them jump up and down they're just excited because they're just learning but for us we know so much so while you preaching we will just shake our heads because we understand everything you are spiritually con but God is looking for a people hallelujah that have the word and have the spirit whereby you can receive the Holy Ghost and allow him to per your soul your spirit your body hallelujah hallelujah amen whereby when he comes upon you you will not fear to say Amen when he comes upon you do not fear to jump up and say hallelujah when he comes upon you do not fear to raise up your hand and to tell your brother did you hear that and to tell the pastor come on preacher why because we know what we believe we are not only Believers but we are drunken believer we are drunk of wine the wine of Revelation we drunk of the Holy Ghost Oh Glory to God if you are still sober come to our spiritual come to our spiritual let us give you some little wine oh do you want some my sister do you want some my sister receive some of it receive some of it that will stir up your spirit St up your soul you cannot sit quiet when the true word is being given to you you will be sted up sometimes when a preacher is preaching I feel like I can't even because the fire there's a fire coming from within you feel like you want to shout to bust out what is it it is the wine it's the power the spirit of God in your soul in your spirit and it comes upon your body too well Pastor the body is never changed the body can't feel the ghost I know that I know even after feeling all [Music] emotions you will still go back and be tempted because this body is sinful right it cannot receive the Holy Ghost but if what you have on your soul is of god it will be also be manifested upon your flesh the Bible tells me one day Soul wanted to kill David he sent him men these men went where David was and the anointing of the Holy Ghost was there and every man that reached there he began prophesying say the Lord hallelujah hallelu hallelujah hallelujah and they would be slain in the spirit have you ever been slain in the spirit yes whereby you fall down because you being you are slain in the you feel your feet can't even slain in the and he sent another group they back he said these boys Bo let me go myself boys give me my horses the king is on the move and he went where the man of God was and when he reached there as he was entering the spirit of God Came Upon him in his soul on his flesh and in his Spirit it was an anointing and at that moment he began the Bible saying rolling on the floor you was slain in the spirit that just fell down and began rolling th say the Lord th Lord the man was prophesying from morning to evening what are you talking about that you you have so much of the spirit you have you don't have emotion your religion is dead our Prophet told us if your religion has no emotion bu it kindly bu it and he will give you another one which has emotion about amen if their religion of football has emotion how much more hours hours which comes and strikes in the soul don't tell me you are composed you are just St you're not allowing the word to penetrate but you let him one day you will see what will happen to you he will Electrify your soul body and spirit hallelujah hallelujah oh do you always think I just want to shout at you it is him who electrifying me even when I said let me just talk quiet in a moment I'm already begin what is it it is the holy spirit praise God I'll read for you another quot here hallelujah hallelujah in a message thean Church age we talking about this wheat and the tears okay the wheat and the Tails which from the first age until now have grown side by side they are now harvesting what set out to accomplish has finally come to pass with all the might of the organization of the false Church turns from any vage of Truth and with political might reinforces herself with State backing I'm coming to that even here in Uganda we have it now and sets out to eradicate forever the True Believer please don't be here and you miss this it will be the biggest mistake of your life because this is prophetic it's already happening Even in our country they have the false Doctrine they will unite the whole church and they will have political power government supporting and all for what to eradicate the True Believer you even finding our own Pentecostal preachers now wearing gowns like their mother the one the Bible talks about in Revelation 17 they came out but now they are going back is prophesied it's not only what they doing it also it is something that was prophesied but just when she's about to accomplish her cowardly plot to whe the wheat is gathered into the [Music] Ghana they have United their World Council of churches we are we are going to have a new world order whereby Rome will rule the whole world the pope will have no longer only religious power but it will be backed by political power backed by economic power literally his word will be low and the Bible would say if to those who do not have the mark of the beast they will be persecuted how do you receive the mark of the beast by joining their councel by joining their Federation by joining their false Unity why is it a false Unity because it is a Unity that is not unifying people to the word it is unifying the people to something else and by joining that because the Bible says brother some that they receive the mark either by their right hand or by their forehead why forehead you will either have to believe the false teachings that is the forehead it shows intellect understanding faith belief or by the right hand you don't have to believe what you believe just agree with us let us unite let us be one and you are seeing Islam Catholicism p and all the other denominations coming together we are one we are one they fulfilling scripture very busy receiving the mark of and they don't know but what is it for it is for the they plotting to eradicate the True Believer they are plotting to completely remove the True Believer from the Earth as it was in the beginning when Cain killed AB that is the plot of the devil but the prophet of God says here just when she is about to accomplish her cowardly plot the we the bride the True Church the true vine will be gathered into the G Hallelujah we are going to the Ghana we are going to the rapture we are going to heaven just before the tribulation there is no way we can be persecuted by the false Church remember we are in the age of the flying eego there are four beasts my dear the Bible speaks about in The Book of Revelation are you still here what is the first one everybody shouting lion what's the second one o the ones who don't read the Bible are seeing stars now go and read your Bible what is the third one face of mank what is the fourth one flying eag now these are four anointings of God to combat the four anointings of Satan where do we get this in the revelation of the [Music] seals because there he speaks about the four anointed of Satan it comes first in the white horse rider he comes riding and everybody said he is on the White Horse that is Jesus but God sent a prophet in our generation that came and said Is Not Jesus he's not Jesus and that was the revelation of the first SE is not Jesus it has been revealed to me because he is he that sat on that horse had a bow but he had no Arrow which means he can't shoot to kill is a BL but White Horse because he's riding as a righteous one but he's not a rightous he's perverting the truth of God into a life so he's a deceiver amen that's why you had a white horse many received it because they thought it was the truth but it was the false church it was the false Spirit the spirit of the Antichrist they say we have the big churches we have the big pastors the government accept us we are more than you but that is a deception if what they teaching is not in the Bible then it is deception amen and the White Horse was converted by the by The Lion The anointing of God that he had risen deception came in and God used the anointing of a li lion means Purity purity of the word power truth lion oh my I wish I would go in details and then comes the next horse rider everybody who was he the red horse rider read the book of Revelation how many I enjoying this tonight how many I enjoying this tonight the red horse rider brother what was he the same devil that came as a white horse rider he realized the more I deceive these people the more they multiplying we are now in church history he realized he can't finish the Believers he realized they are unstoppable he can't deceive them he can't deceive them so brother M what he decided to do was to change colors let me tell you Church the devil has tried to change colors in you but still can't finish you because there is an anointing on you a powerful anointing because the Bible says when the Devil comes in like a flag the spirit of God raises standard raise standard so now the devil came he said let me change colors he came as a red hor Rider to do what to bring death to bring persecution he persecuted the church like never before that that's the time of the matters not the matters we are seeing we're talking about the matters in the Dark Ages forget about these ones who died for the false Church we're talking about the ones who died for this world hallelujah amen and this you know the the Catholic Church these things are really surprising the Catholic system and when I talk about it I don't have any problem with the people there I'm talking about the false Church system people there our brothers many of them will believe this message I'm talking about the wrong or false Church system the same system that claims now they you know worshiping matters they are the same one who killed Believers in the dark you saw the Pope the current pop he was apologizing for the millions not hundreds of thousands millions of the Christians they killed the Catholic denomination K in Cold Blood many of them they will take women who have pregnant like sister take the arena and they tell them now are you ready to recant your faith oh you are not if you're not you ready to recant and accept this our church to be the only true church then you can go and the women would say I Rec I refuse to to recant I refuse to I contend for the faith they would release those wild bears rap their stomachs AP and they would die because of loss of blood they would reap their Belles take their children feed them to this business and they would watch them die and others were scared for us we Catholics because of fear of death and that's how they got the numbers they did not evangelize praise the name of the Lord no no one can imprison me because these are facts it can even be taken to the court of law it is facts facts is written down we we have evidence history has it you cannot remove it and they killed Believers even the Bible in the Book of Revelation it prophesied before it happened he said that woman she drunken with the blood of the Saints because God knew she would do that and after they did it then they would make them saints later they killed Peter they buried him in Basilica in vaan they said Peter is now a saint is even our first pop Peter a first pop that man was a mared man so if Peter was a pope then he was my pop not their Pope it means more Catholic than they are these are facts are you hearing me church I told you I'm going to our principles the foundations these are facts and they have deceived the whole world it's a it's a false Vine it's a false Church system The Men Who crept in our awars and their number one uh uh Target is to kill the True Believer to eradicate the heart from the world but you cannot because we in our generation we don't even these believers who were killed they were killed but you see why did they accept to die because God gave them an anointing the anointing of the ox the ox is a burden of sacrifice they were willing they were anointed to die so the more they killed the more people were willing to Die the devil said these people are not what can I do he changed colors he now came in the third color he came as a black horse to bring death to bring death but even then God was still moving when the devil came as a black what kind of death what kind of famine and death we notice the Bible speaks of it that in the end time there will be fine not of food or water but femine of the word because if people are hungry they will die so the devil now he said oh it is what they believe let me take the word from them and we notice it was at that time they passed laws you can't read the Bible and that's why up to today Roman Catholics don't read they beginning nowadays but very few it was not allowed because those who did were killed in Cold Blood The Man Who translated this Bible his name is William Tinder he was killed they tied him on a stick and put firewood who did that the Catholic church and they put fire and the man died but he died believing he contended for the faith and they got this Bible it is said in history they would buy from him thousands of Bibles and you know how he was selling the Bibles he wasn't selling them in the open he would himself somewhere and and and you know you know get this you know feeds of the animals and put those bibles inside and then behave as if he's selling feeds and the Catholic Church would buy thousands of Bibles from him and they would burn them in a b to stop him but history has it that he would take the money they had given him and he would use it to produce more Bibles contending for the faith Hallelujah and they try to burn these Bibles the King James versioning James they have never finished it from the world I have a copy of it here today you have a copy that's why you should read it if the devil didn't want you to read it it mean there is something in there he didn't want you to know don't accept that the devil to Blind you go and read your Bible there is something the devil doesn't want you to know we must be enlightened the devil wants us to be blind but we refuse to be blind just say it I refuse to be blind hallelujah hallelujah amen and we notice they they try to kill them and bring famine and even the Bible which was translated at that time was only from in Latin and and the Latin was also not accurate but God you know he brought the anointing of face of a man face is where intelligence is knowledge two things happened number one God anointed men with the understanding of scripture like William tind that he knew many languages he knew Latin he knew Greek he knew Hebrew he knew English and he could interpret this Bible in the right way and other men like John W and others men who were anointed and another man to invent what we call the printing press at first my friends were in 2024 at first everybody was writing and they would not write with a pen they were writing with with feathers from from hands chicken they would pull it out and get ink from some of these some things with ink they would get it and then dip the the feather inside the ink and they would write but imagine if you want 20 million people to read the Bible how many can you write so God who is riching he anointed a man with an anointing to have knowledge and he invented the printing press it is said the company or the man who invented it went bankrupt and he stopped the business and he sold it to the people who were doing the Bible it wasn't for them it was for us hallelujah God had you in mind me in mind Hallelujah the anointing of a face of man and we are in the last age and in this last age the devil has now coming like a big flag the red hor Rider the white hor Rider the black horse rider all mixed together and the devil is coming our generation now as a pale horse rider who is he what is he he has come now to finish everything through politics don't be overtaken by that Spirit through politics through the economy huh economy and through religion those are the three things Rome will have to control the world in the New World Order that is coming and the target is still the true church we are the true church will she be able to get us would she be able to get us why why I say the flying ego we are the generation of the flying ego anointing Hallelujah brother Hallelujah the flying eag anointing sister don't you worry when things are hard the anointing is coming on you soon and very soon we are going to see the king soon and very soon we are going to see how in rapture we are going to fly away Oh Glory Fly Away sing with me I will not die uhuh sing like as if you're going to fly away come on one more time I'll Fly Away we fly away Oh Glory I shall not die I shall not die Hallelujah by and by oh give the Lord a crap of Praise Church hallelujah hallelujah amen hallelujah oh my give me 15 16 more minutes in the time I ask for you now I said a moment ago the fal Vine came into the into full fation in this age her fuit would mature and ripen that is correct the evil spirited Church full of iniquity will be revealed as the mastered seed that grew into a tree wherein L the fs of the air at her head will be the Antichrist the mystery of iniquity all this is true and if this is true now listen to this one this is yours now then it must also be through that the bride church WIll mature and her ripeness shall be an identification with her Lord by means of the word and her head will who will come to her is the mystery of godliness which indeed is Christ and as the false church with all kinding and diabolical power made up a political force physical force and the Demons of Darkness as they come against this True Vine the True Vine with the fullness of the spirit and the word will do the very Act of power that Jesus did hallelujah amen the same power the same anointing you are not talking about chap chip Miracles we are talking about manifestation of the power of God right through the true church then as she nears her headstone becoming like him through the word Jesus will come that the bride and groom may be forever United as already the visible manifestations of what I have been telling you are seen all around us we have seen even in little assembly here the move of the spirit and we should keep on burning we should keep on going like that the presence of God around us amen I we shall go in the testimonies The ecumenical move of the is factual but also it is a fact that the prophet of the last age must be bringing forth a message from God that will forun the the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ for by his message will the hearts of the children be turned back to the Pentecostal father and with the restoration of the word oh are you hearing this sister Juliet by the restoration of the word will come the restoration of is the word restored I ask you is the word restored then the power is restored also not to me only not to each of us we've got the power in the name of Jesus really have you God have power in the name of the Lord where Satan raes what some of you are not singing don't you go Oh in the name of the Lord hallelujah amen the restoration of power also comes with the restoration of the [Music] work what crucial times are these in which we live how careful we must be that we remain true to the word to this word and not take from it or to it for he would speak where God has not spoken makes him a liar what I have particularly in mind is this about the turn of the century the hunger for God that was generated in the Philadelphian age and brought a cry of the spirit of God and this was mainly L by a black man in America called Street Place Street Brother Martin what was the name of that man that that brother black brother that had you know was was really you know leading people to seek the Holy Ghost and when they the cry was answered by sending forth manifestation in tongues interpretation and prophecy a group immediately now before we continue here these people were all coming together praying and crying at at the end of the Philadelphian Church age people desired to see God people were hungry for the Supernatural and as they were praying God came down ATA Street and he filled them with the Holy Ghost men began to speak in Tong and interpret and prophesy I tell you this was a real move of God it was the real anointing okay but he says immediately a group most contrary to the word it Drew up a doctrine that tongues was the evidence of being baptized with the Holy Ghost and these are now the ones who who I'm talking about they're going back they going back to their mother they're dressing like their mother they're talking like their mother they are called Pentecostals but they look like Catholics they going back to their mother and they denominated and the prophet would say when they denominate they die when any movement denominates it dies because God does not use denominations period God uses his word not denominations they denominated and they died and they said if you are not talking tongues it means you don't have the Holy Spirit and some of them even took up to teaching people how to talk tongues so don't say just say many times and then say then now it means you when you say it many times you lose your mind and it means now you have the thank God for the message thank God for the message yeah listen to what the message of Our Generation teaches the T were manifestation of the spirit but not the evidence of the spirit someone can speak tongues and go to hell someone can actually speak Tong when they are not filled with the Holy Ghost but tongues are a manifestation of the spirit but they are not manifest of the evidence of the indwelling of the Holy Ghost in the individual it is a gift just like preaching is a gift because the Holy Ghost is coming on me to preach it does not mean I have a ticket to Heaven you can preach and still go to hell they came and said didn't we preach in your name did we raise the dead in your name didn't we speak Tong in you did not say you did not do those things you even rais the dead yes but go away from me doers of iniquity they knew the word but they did not love the word they loveed their denomination more than the word they refus to submit themselves to the thank God we have received a prophet messenger who has restored back us back to the foundations amen of the faith we now know that tongues must also be in the church manifestation of the gifts and we have seen it happening in our church assembly and we want more of it it must be there had some believer saying no now that we have believe the message don't believe in those things and you were in a church four five 10 years no one gift no prophecy no T no gift of healing nothing and you claim to be a believer of the message there is a problem somewhere there is a problem somewhere because he must manifest his presence let us be like that brother Gideon when when they were always being taken by the gibeonites and other people whenever they harest they come and one day the angel of the Lord came and he found gide hiding and he told Gideon oh th man of Val God is with you he said Angel wait what did you say if God is with with us where are his miracles hallelujah hallelujah if we claim to have the message where are the Miracles where are the signs and wonders where is the manifestation of the Holy Ghost where is it and you find our churches are quiet and dead like a mo [Music] I will tell you if that's one of our churches here get out of it yes sir because it's a Same Spirit we are fighting getting back to the original containing for the faith and whenever you see that kind of quietness that kind of Silence where you preaching the word and people are like rocks it means there is a lot of sin going on there is a lot of immorality going on there is a lot of back back backward sins going on but if you are one of them there is still amen hallelujah there is a blood flowing from calvar wash you white as snow and cleanse you and save you and red you and fill you with the Holy Ghost amen we want that original church we are containing for the original that fality of the doctrine canot only be seen by a lack of scripture to sub substantiate it but those who subscribe to the doctrine immediately organized on the basis of the doctrine as Pentecostals of course we know that amen the doctrine of t as subscrib to it as a Doctrine and they organized on the basis of the doct proving that they were not in the truth as they would have people believe not like I said we believe in tongues but Tong tongues are a manifestation not an Evidence you that speak of tongues are filled with the Holy Ghost can can the speaker can the Speaker of tongues be filled with the Holy Ghost yes but both the one filled and the one not filled can both have the anointing upon them and they can speak tongues the prophet that the Bible says the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance you can be a sinner and yet gifted is that right have you not seen people who are gifted and yet they not converted and so it's a gift that comes from God not from the Devil by the way from God you see he says the rain falls on the just and the unjust both The Bad and The Good the Sinners and the righteous the rain is the holy spirit he's not saying feeling them he's saying falls upon them he's saying they receive the anointing of it so they get anointed in their Spirit but they are not filled in their soul and that's why oh Hallelujah the message has been restored to us now to go back to the original whereby you cannot be filled with the Holy Ghost unless you believe the true word the true word is the Original Seed which will make you able to receive the Holy Spirit are you hearing me now and even the tongues they speak in their churches let me come to you and tell you this they are not the real Pentecost bial times the place where I see them is the Tower of [Music] B come up here brother you have a very good language I love it come you have a very good one come here you have a very good one come come come come look this one is a Manda do you know you not can you speak it very well but you can speak it and you speak you speak wonderful do I have a brother no he's not here today all right so we have we have a we have we have and now I want us to speak something to these people each of us at the same time 1 2 3 go can you speak brother and this one said what believe okay now whatever you said I want you to say it at a go 1 2 3 go you are laughing but we are giving you a message but you can't understand it because is all a confusion number one we all speaking at a go that's a confusion number two there is no interpretation Paul told it clear don't do it like that one speak fast and another one after that another one speak and another he says in the church service maximum three maximum three maximum otherwise we will be in the service of Tong and and also he says he says if there is no inter we will not stop you brother but we shall tell you to go at home and pray that you may interpret if you can't interpret someone should interpret what you're saying but if every time you speaking in Tong in church every time you're speaking in Tong in church no one is interpreting you then you should go and first pray that you may interpret but if also you can't interpret after prayer Pray them in your house but in the church pray with words people can understand now many message believers they love that ending there Paul was not preaching against he was setting the church in order he was telling them how Tong should operate but for us we silence them and others be like I feel like talking T but I can't interpret I can't interpret don't worry just say it speak it if it is of god he will raise an interpreter hallelujah hallelujah these are Bible principles so we believe in tongues but the tongues we see in the Pentecostal world it is it is the bab tongues but the T the tongues of Acts chapter 2 people will understand what you are saying it is for what for edifying the church contending for the faith now I'm trying to find a place to finish I'm already 5 minutes beyond the time I I request I I promise you all right here the original okay okay oh where was I brother man this is this is sweet how many I enjoying it it's a very it's like a very sweet pie my my my my I'm enjoying it if you're enjoying it tell your neighbor I'm enjoy oh it looked good it looked like the return of [Music] Pentecost he's talking about the Pentecostal movement now it looked like the return of Pentecost of act but it proved it wasn't it could not be because it organized that is death not life it looked so close to the real that multitudes were [Music] deceived now if it wasn't the genuine what was it don't miss this church it was the HK the cha in the green soft sheath form it like uh uh like it looked like it was the real thing but as one can go into the field and see what it looks what looks exactly like wheat and yet it is only the H for the wheat seed had not yet formed the original seed of Pentecost was to come back in the last age it had been bued at it sent up a shoot s s it grew a t at philia it was to mature at but it could not be back to the original until the word was [Music] restored amen when the seed was planted in the beginning in the days of Paul it started growing started growing and at the at the end of the Philadelphian Church age that seed brought forth what we saw here which was like a heart kind of thing and many thought that was the SE when they began speaking in Tong and healing and but it could not have been the true SE because they had all the manifestation but there was no restoration of the world where do we see the true church it must have the true word and the manifestation of the Holy Ghost so now the Pentecostal movement could not bu the original Church to not fully restore us back again we needed something more there was a promise in the Lan Church age that there will come a messenger with a of restoration Hallelujah he restore the full the Malachi for Messenger has restored to us the full word of God and the spirit has been already done restored back to us now we have both we we are restored back again to the foundation message is the real deal I I can't finish but I tell you what I think I'll have a part two of this how many agree we need to go and have a part two on this but when I say I have it on Wednesday you people don't come where do you always go on Wednesday how many will come on Wednesday so I have a w okay if you don't if you're not coming on

pack their food and those who did not maybe they could we shall fix something for them simple and then we shall in 30 minutes come back to the service so the Lord bless you and greet your neighbor while smiling tell them God bless you and be with you this week bless them bless them as God will inspire you amen amen shake their hands and bless them [Music] amen uh before we go brother Peter uh we I have a list here e TR Chana for six months rent that's up to the end of November so it is eating up on our land fund so two things we need to do one those who can give towards that rent please do and the Lord will bless you and then also those who have um you know who are giv towards the land fund let us multiply it so that we can suffocate all these expenses and then we have enough to uh I don't believe we are going to be here for more than two years from now uh and I'm saying that on on a certain Authority that I know so we we need to double up our giving so that we I know I know we can make it there are many who have sometimes you give and other times you I'm seeing others are giving this much let me also give this much give as though it is only you going to buy the church lunch and ask yourself if you're giving 5,000 is it really what you had only is it really what you can do can you do more then do it and I promise you it's not me who promises actually the word of God promises us a blessing to those who serve god with their substance let us be a partake of this the day will come when all this shall be behind us and all those that contributed to this cause will be now the beneficiaries of those blessings now those who will not be beneficiaries of it you will not feel bad for sure because others gave and they did what they could God wanted to kill one of the man one of the Kings I think and he said please remember all the good I did for you and he was added how many 15 so what will you tell the Lord that you've done for you want God to bless you you want to give you a good job you want him to give you good things good this good that what will you use it for how is God benefiting from that when his work is stagnating I'm encouraging us I'm not qu to serve God with our substance amen God bless you your dismiss I'll not keep you long because we have another service shortly so it's 2:20 uh 30 minutes is going to be at uh 10 minutes to to three please let's be here we are mature people we don't shouldn't take a lot of time I just have something to share with you so God bless you [Music]
