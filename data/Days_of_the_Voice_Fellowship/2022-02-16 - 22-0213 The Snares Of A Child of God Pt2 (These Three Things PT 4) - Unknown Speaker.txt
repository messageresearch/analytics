[Applause] [Music] and [Music] [Applause] oh hallelujah oh hallelujah why don't you just continue to give the lord [Applause] [Music] [Music] hallelujah i'd like us to turn to the scripture um i have a lot to talk about today so i hope that uh time will be enough for us to contribute tomorrow i'm continuing with our subject which we started uh the past week and uh really no one should should have missed this i'm a cemetery and now yeah they asked watch you know and those who have missed please no make sure you send them the link and encourage them to uh watch this summer and but also at the same time i'll be speaking on part four of these three things [Music] you but mccabe in trevis are trevino number one the pride of life problem the last of yeah so now so this would be like a part four to that subject we talked about category also it will be part two of the snares of a child of god on the same subject so we are reading from the glacier chapter 7 verse [Music] we come before you reverently this evening we ask that you will come and give us the bread of life today to serve you to many romantic problems speak to us and also my brothers and sisters as they listen to and even those that shall watch and listen to this later now it is in jesus name i mean verse 26 and i find more bitter than death the woman whose heart is snares and nets and her hands as parents whoso pleases god shall escape from her but the sinner shall be taken by her endeavors [Music] the snares of a child of god if the lord speaks to you and i find more better than death so we found out that it is more bitter a woman rather a woman whose heart is snares and necks is more bitter than death timber move about that woman the mystery of babylon she's called mystery babylon about the mother of hallows and all the abominations of the earth of your neighbors so we noticed that this spiritual woman contracted evangelion means the church which is supposed to be the church or wife to jesus christ [Music] she actually rejected jesus christ and because she rejected the headship of jesus christ [Music] because she replaced the teachings of the true word of god for her own creeds and dogmas and other doctrines that are not truly the word of god like believing in you know teaching penitence or mr penitencio teaching purgatory somebody can die and then they can be prayed for and then so we found out that this the bible calls it the wine of half fornication and she's making all the kings of the world and the peoples of the world both great and small to partake of that wine [Music] [Music] and these daughters are having these daughters are also having the same characteristics of their mother that came out of the major uh denomination which is the roman catholic church [Music] and whenever they come out of the roman catholic church they also form denominations their own denominations praise the lord my name is hallelujah hallelujah are you following me and this brother banham says that whenever they denominated they died and whenever they die god leaves them whenever they die the revival moves on uh but having no holiness but rejecting the life and the life is in the world is somebody following me this evening the life is in the [Applause] systems in food the dead systems of man in kuala lumpur we have been set free tomorrow and throughout the dead systems and now that's not all and now we saw that this woman types the church she finally checked this woman types the church [Music] hallelujah amen and i wanted to listen to what the prophet of god says here and this is what we read also last time there is the there is there is three things that i've watched in my life he said one waving to be such a nikkei will give him an opportunity to do a little more work for him or something the first thing that saturn goes to working with that minister is thrift is three things and he says that i am like a first like indeed in the garden of eden so now when the true church of the living god left this confusion of denominationalism [Music] take it the devil at first wanted to trap us by the spirit of this woman by denominational spirit religious spirits [Music] in those such places or maybe fought for foreign gave you people think about the matter was that the devil is in bad places only in the satani i remember phobia but i want to a problem or difficulty to a true the devil in the d in a discontent does not cause a snare to me the devil among those people who take alcohol the drunkards and the smokers and the weird smokers does not cause a threat to me he is working in them but allah there are someone some which are remaining and the moment the last one comes into the body of christ the rapture will happen [Music] a german academy is in a place that a child of god is expected to be oman and what place is that you that place is in the churches they decide to praise god and that is why it is hallelujah man i said hallelujah hallelujah that is why yes i find that it is in the religious order hey where the you find very many people [Applause] two people a thousand or two hundred or four hundred i don't care i preach the same timing why because the word of god is going to intend to come to you today and you can begin to overcome these three things come to ministers that i [Applause] the ones who are serving the lord those are the ones that the devil is intending to let us know and which the snails will hear you yeah and you find very many examples as we shall see today is and are you there everybody there hallelujah amen amen and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food lust of the flesh [Music] [Music] them until the coming of the lord many will be defeated i tell you what there are those who are predestinated not to fall amen the bible says we're going to bring them out of the you will not fall the second evil not foreign [Applause] amen because i said i have a lot to cover hallelujah and i did not want to spread it to the next service because the next service i have something let's talk about i mean hallelujah and jesus being full of the holy ghost returned from jordan and was led by the spirit into the wilderness and in those days the devil was really laying snares satania takamitego hallelujah amen brother marvin where are we organized and in those days he did eat nothing but when they they end but when they were ended he afterwards prophet said if god puts the first on you you will not be hungry you don't be hungry you realize many times that your prayer has been answered if you said i think you're going to choose he had been in prayer for 40 days and unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time [Music] [Applause] [Music] will you worship me everything you see all about the beautiful women whatever you want yesterday all the things of the world all the things of the world foreign he promised him that he will fly the devil was literally telling jesus go down and fly [Music] amen that he should take a little bit of the pride of life god pokemon and when the devil attended all the temptation he departed from him what do we see here hallelujah the devil wants to blind you with money he never wants to do that he wants to blind the believers with money me you find them putting a big look at money as if it is the best in the world some people when it comes to money they can find salvation [Music] they can prophesy heaven on earth to you yes open your past to them saying god worried somebody give a little and then they'll pray for you close to jesus whether you bring your money or not what is this that's not what god wants a man called simon the sorcerer commander on your mother he brought money to the servants of god honestly at this moment i don't care if i had your feelings amazing because i'm preaching the word now this is nothing against rich people about abandonment but also it can be a snare to you because you are so poor you have nothing [Music] that's why you should not be any of them and you can't work no got no color and you can't labor no food and you become a beggar november money can be such a snail in same business but those have not the faith of our lord jesus of jesus christ with respect to persons um have not the faith of our lord jesus christ with respect of persons [Music] the poor there were trying to butter up the reach in order to get help [Music] in the church oh my god when is poor neighbor no one even calls his name but when he's rich [Applause] our precious marvelous [Music] your business the bible says god be here you can't be the man that trusts in a man you're calling me don't do it say james don't in our generation that we have than we have ever had yet less is being accomplished [Music] it is not with money that god works of the spirit comes only to a life consecrated to the word is that only the poor will go to heaven that's not the word we're not saying that if you are blessed you are if you are you are rich you are make yourselves friends of the moment of unrighteousness that when you fail to remedy them they may receive you into everlasting habitation use material who resources as a way gain color to further the work of god so that our when it runs out broly carried out they the frenzy man of vegeta wow yes the the they the friends you made they will welcome they in this case it means the friends they will welcome you into eternal dwelling big jackpot but your qualities all right so now i'll explain a little more [Music] and he said that there was a rich man but where do you say the next guy who had as a servant a manager of his wealth and saw this manager of this rich man as well was not a good man he was not a good man and so he was told that your manager the man who is managing your wealth is playing around captain america it might actually be uh uh you know laid off from the work he devised a plan on behalf that he has but he said that is the wisdom of the world niagara manchego and he said the children of the world see a wise magazine why is that an ass that guys are too seen because for them [Music] made himself [Applause] and he used his master's money captain how could the sense i would come away to make a friend what about the believers also make yourselves friends but in this case make a ton of friends that's the same thing do the work of god oh god [Music] but when it is over now even if you become poor never only know you have foreign do you think that whatever you give to the lord you have no eternal rewarding with your bible when did you have when where you look at that with dress steve you're wearing that button at quan bazaar when would you do things happen every interview would be and then the master mukamel have looked on at some other people naturally then this man oh but all the other investments praise the name of the lord [Music] if you have not paid your who will commit to you trust [Music] and money is not a snail like we have read to the rich only work of god you decide to send it to your mother in the village when they have better views are collecting money for the church and you you are very busy standing for funerals and here you say pastor you know who will trust you and yeah [Music] oh [Music] it is some will get um life having not been a part of the bride make no mistake in the rapture because they gave money they will not go having previously given thinking i'm giving together life hallelujah [Music] so friends stewardship obuanika money is a big subject we can talk about it for days but allow me to stop it therefore we should not allow mana to be a snare to us certainly now when you get money before the center amen you see the question stop the law what is that needs of your family and then serve the lord hallelujah and then number two women that's near number two okay women last of the flesh did you know that people there they actually become richer and richer [Music] the day you will get 1 million [Music] of your salvation leaves me christ cast me not away from thy presence [Music] is because that you may be justified when you speak to me and be clear when you judge me i haven't seen it my mother conceived i'm just telling everything i've done the last of the flesh will ensnare you and if you find you ever find yourself in such a trap you must confess to your husband you know quite really bad the three every children retain their strengths they return their faith because they did not eat from the king's strength overcome when they sing you can't oh your we should not allow such a spirit we should stand and stand and live above it pretty immediately no to the last of the flesh joseph found favor with god yes because he didn't give in to potiphar's [Music] [Music] because when the last of the flesh ensnared he ran away from me he fleed from me and the young people the bible says flee from you know what it means you could see the future if your master and you could understand the voice of the spirit not to get rid of the muslim or you but when the prophet spoke this man was so ensnared from such journey pass over there they just hear words but they don't feel the anointing but they don't get into the service but they just have a very diplomatic service never been any services because they have most of them are inspired by the church of god dynamics is i was raised in a very spiritual family my father was a preacher all my young life but for my first time in my whole life at narration but he was saying i now walk too much i i get so tired but the problem was she was already enslaved [Music] let let us overcome these demonstrations overcome this nest you know hallelujah and i'll take the last one and finish [Music] it i said i'll check the last one i'm not reading a vengeance my brother oh congratulations the pride of life [Music] all the people as the easterners do usually maybe i'll begin reading from um from a little bit down here where hundreds are standing around and coming in criminally mediocre now to download an anointed face no way nobody come after you not a face which is not annoying sight think of it jesus with that yes jesus yes with that effect god you never get it it does something to me now friends i'm reading this quote taking this last beat of the pride of life was lying there with under with with with unwashed feet yes what does that symbolize what is it to do with popularity or the pride of life jesus was poor them were rich man so they put jesus in a corner that big is he asked my lord to come and let him sit over there with that dung on his feet he wouldn't give him any oil after in the church these days you see someone shutting tears when was the last time you shot tears in the church whatever behaving like an evangelistic if you are you have not washed jesus's feet with your tears you are acting like the pharisees if you have not anointed him with oil oh what's the name of calculation how do you do that by getting into the holy ghost by allowing yourself to be swayed away by the power of all the gods i'm afraid i'm a canister there is no oil in my face there is no water to wash jesus and jesus is in the corner with oh it is supposed to be a place hey take it back what you feel where we come to watch jesus open us with our tears namaste if there is no tears there is no conviction but whatever my secret is the one it is just religion jesus's feet is that dead maybe you're gonna be is to be jammer it needs to be washed what is happening what is wrong with this person i don't have a i can't understand let me see it i can't understand this transfer because i don't know that's a problem you are the one with the problem holy cow can't you see why did the people hate pentecostals when they first started out why child and tobacco happened because they were washing jesus with the tears they said we cannot we cannot identify with ourselves we cannot make fools out of us and to struggle away from our civil rights we are educated to us we are sober people together we know what you're talking about you don't get a good treatment so how can we stoop so low oh god that mercy on oh god jesus is in your town yes amen i mean jesus is in your church yes amen i mean and it says entertain him entertain him [Music] call me a fanatic than being in a horrible cast that's what it means to be pentecostal hallelujah looking on leaping and dancing before the lord and she despised him in his eyes [Applause] and i think even if you are going to come and sing for us to the body you don't come and sing the words sure yeah we want people who are kind of singing specials getting acid to the spirit so can you see that the brother or sister who was inspired to write that song was under another age yes that was [Music] oh that's the reason why some of these songs we sing without revelation we should stop singing if a song that comes on the pulpit i'm going to say speak about the song we are going to say and so when someone comes to sing a song when someone is sing a song just look on you get into the worship english season get into the prayers you see mikhail was just looking on mikhail and david the hoodie was not looking on it do you know what they were doing what was even dancing too yeah i will hallelujah amen that's because of the word going on why would people steal that those as if they are in the in the traditional churches what happened to offended it's a disgrace [Music] then david returned to bless his household our daughter now come on as one of the main fellows of shamelessly uncovered himself it was before the lord shall be masturbated chose me before my thy father before all his houses you appoint me ruler over the people of the lord foreign i don't care what you think [Music] is servants which thou has spoken of and of them shall i be shall i be heard in honor i'm writing the same reaction the daughter of saul said nothing about you entering into that atmosphere [Music] [Music] of the pride of life the pride of life will not allow you to do that if i was not educated like this will be poor and they would say they are rich they will they will have a form of godliness financially but denying the power god help us to not envy so that he can be pleased i wanna send you okay calm in our time when we wash his feet when we we when we anoint him but you've come jesus [Music] on me [Music] shine [Music] on me [Music] shine on me [Music] on me [Music] lose yourself right now let us worship him for a little bit [Music]
