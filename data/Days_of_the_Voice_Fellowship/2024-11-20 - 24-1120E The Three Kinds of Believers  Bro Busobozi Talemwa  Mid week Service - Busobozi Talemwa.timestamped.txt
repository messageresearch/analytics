[26:51] johnes when they this say this is this
[26:56] ising
[26:58] he it when Jesus knew himself M he said
[27:04] them off
[27:13] you
[27:16] quick speakto you are and they
[27:21] are some of you not Jesus knew from the
[27:26] beginning who they that not and who
[27:31] should betray him and
[27:35] he you that can come unto me except were
[27:40] given unto him of my father

[28:34] [Music]
[28:40] [Music]
[28:48] and we will also read from 66 to vers
[28:52] 71 from that time many of his disciples
[28:55] went back and walked no more with him
[28:59] then J then said Jesus unto the twel
[29:02] would you also go away then Simon Peter
[29:04] answered him Lord to whom shall we go
[29:07] thou Hast the words of eternal life and
[29:09] we believe and assure that thou art that
[29:12] Christ the son of the Living God Jesus
[29:15] answered them have I have not I chosen
[29:17] you 12 and one of you is a devil he
[29:20] spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon
[29:23] for he it is for he it was that should
[29:27] betray him
[29:28] being one of the 12
[30:18] amen you may be seated may the Lord
[30:20] bless the reading of his word
[30:23] tonight amen
[30:26] amen praise the name of the Lord
[30:29] so this evening I'm speaking on the
[30:31] three kinds of
[30:35] Believers and I'm re-echoing it so that
[30:37] it can get to your
[30:40] heart three kinds of
[30:43] Believers now you would imagine that
[30:45] there's only one type of a
[30:49] Believer
[30:51] butam text this title three kinds
[30:58] because there are three kinds of people
[30:59] called
[31:02] Believers and as we shall see it in
[31:05] details one is a make
[31:10] believer and one is a nonbeliever or an
[31:14] nonbeliever and one is a u
[31:18] um
[31:20] um a real
[31:24] believer I begin with the introduction
[31:27] here reading out of of a portion I'm
[31:29] going like I said I'm going to read out
[31:31] of this message quite a
[31:37] lot please give me your undivided
[31:39] attention because these things are very
[31:40] very
[31:43] important the time uh the season where
[31:46] we have reached or arrived in
[31:50] time this message is very
[31:53] important and after today if you can go
[31:55] back and and uh listen to it
[32:00] our Prophet brother bam preached this in
[32:04] 1963 I'm sure it will be a blessing to
[32:08] you amen he says the first is
[32:13] Believers make
[32:15] Believers and
[32:18] unbelievers now that is quite a
[32:21] subject but ass sure as we sit here
[32:25] tonight that group always is gathered
[32:28] [Music]
[32:30] together when I first heard this I was
[32:34] shocked I had left my Anglican
[32:38] church and I was in a believer's church
[32:40] people who believed the end time
[32:43] message and then when I heard brother
[32:45] bam say these
[32:47] words confused me I like I thought I
[32:51] came to real powerful like real genuine
[32:53] believers
[32:56] [Music]
[32:58] mean that even among the churches or
[33:00] even the group of Believers of the
[33:02] message of the hour these three groups
[33:04] are still
[33:11] there the answer is
[33:13] yes he says as sure as we sit here
[33:18] tonight that group is always
[33:21] always gathered
[33:25] together wherever the people gather
[33:28] we find this
[33:29] group and always have found them and we
[33:34] probably will always find them until the
[33:36] coming of the
[33:40] Lord and I want us tonight to picture
[33:44] ourselves as I speak of these three
[33:47] groups I want you to picture yourself as
[33:50] one of those three
[33:53] groups so listen carefully and as you
[33:55] are listening try to picture yourself as
[33:57] one of the three
[34:01] group now remember he says I'm speaking
[34:04] here to maybe this
[34:08] church and he says but I'm also speaking
[34:11] to the world
[34:14] around while I also speak to the church
[34:16] here physically I'm speaking to those on
[34:18] the YouTube I'm speaking to the Saints
[34:20] at evening light on the on the zoom
[34:28] so this is it cuts
[34:30] across and as our Prophet says in all
[34:33] different parts of the
[34:36] world these step culate through
[34:41] Ministries now I want to speak of the
[34:43] three different types of Believers
[34:47] now now remember
[34:50] Believers my subject is
[34:53] Believers one of them is a True
[34:56] Believer and the next is a make
[35:02] believer and the next is a
[35:06] unbeliever and I have a few comments
[35:08] here he says you know we live in evil
[35:12] times you know it's darker I want to
[35:15] tell you it is darker
[35:17] now than it was 60 years actually it is
[35:20] 61 years ago when this message was first
[35:23] preached by brother
[35:28] 61 years
[35:30] ago when people come to
[35:33] church they often many times have a
[35:37] mindset you know that everyone is a real
[35:42] believer I look over there our sister
[35:44] who is recently
[35:47] baptized you know when you come to
[35:49] church many times you think oh I've
[35:50] joined a group of people who are all
[35:52] real
[35:56] Believers because they look like
[35:58] one but I want to say that is not
[36:02] true so I'm giving a disclaimer
[36:05] tonight our church is not a church of
[36:09] only real
[36:11] Believers well if you want if you want
[36:13] you can say Amen if you want you may
[36:14] leave it but the
[36:17] truth look at the
[36:20] church as a
[36:22] hospital where you have different
[36:24] categories of patients
[36:28] and these patients are suffering from
[36:30] different and various
[36:35] diseases some patients will eventually
[36:39] die these are the
[36:42] nonbelievers some may never get
[36:45] well but they will linger and stay for a
[36:48] long
[36:50] time these are the make
[36:53] Believers and others will certainly
[36:55] recover
[36:58] and they will get quickened they will
[37:00] get energized they will get revived they
[37:03] will get
[37:04] restored and these are the real genuine
[37:08] Believers now when you come to
[37:10] church look at Christ the
[37:14] word as your
[37:17] example don't look at your fellow
[37:21] patients many people have done that
[37:25] mistake they look at their fellow
[37:27] patience as
[37:31] examples we are all
[37:34] patience you should not look at one
[37:36] another as
[37:38] example we should look at our healer
[37:41] Jesus
[37:43] Christ the
[37:45] word that is our
[37:48] example Jesus Christ the word is our
[37:52] healer in this
[37:54] Hospital Jesus Christ is our healer
[37:58] and he uses
[38:01] doctors the
[38:03] preachers to treat
[38:05] us so these
[38:07] doctors the preachers are not
[38:12] healers they only
[38:15] treat but God the word the Holy
[38:19] Ghost he is the
[38:22] Healer now many get
[38:25] offended and they leave the fellowship
[38:28] because another person offended
[38:32] them it is like a patient running away
[38:35] from the
[38:37] hospital before their fellow patient has
[38:41] why are they running
[38:43] away because their fellow patient has a
[38:46] smelly
[38:49] wound you don't know what you're doing
[38:53] you are running away from a place of
[38:56] Refuge you running away from where you
[38:58] will be
[39:00] healed now whether your fellow patient
[39:02] has a smelly
[39:04] wound let him mind his
[39:07] business mind your own
[39:10] business amen as long as you are in the
[39:13] right
[39:15] place where the Healer does his
[39:19] work where he has sent his doctors the
[39:23] preachers then he will accomplish the
[39:25] work in your life
[39:28] others ask
[39:30] help
[39:32] guidance and councel from their own
[39:34] fellow
[39:38] Believers it is like a patient asking
[39:40] another
[39:42] patient how much
[39:46] injections how much
[39:49] tablets it's like a patient asking a
[39:51] fellow patient how much injections and
[39:53] tablets they should take
[39:57] [Music]
[40:02] according to my
[40:03] condition how much injection do you
[40:05] think I should
[40:06] take how much taet do you think I should
[40:09] swallow you can imagine what will
[40:12] happen this other patient will give you
[40:16] poison you know it is right
[40:19] medication but it is given wrong
[40:24] proportions you need a doctor
[40:27] to prescribe that
[40:29] medication the doctor is the only one
[40:32] authorized to treat
[40:36] us you Believers are
[40:40] patient go to the right
[40:43] office when you are faced with a
[40:46] spiritual or physical
[40:49] challenge go to the right
[40:52] office to seek for
[40:56] cel seek for
[40:58] help not everyone is
[41:02] Anointed qualified to help
[41:06] you they may be looking
[41:10] good they may be in the same church as
[41:12] you are but not everyone is Anointed and
[41:15] qualified to help
[41:19] you that's why the Bible says God has
[41:24] sent pastors teachers
[41:28] prophets amen evangelist you know
[41:33] pastors what are they for they are here
[41:36] to edify the
[41:39] body they are here to help the
[41:42] church they are the
[41:45] doctors you know brother bam talks about
[41:48] Peter as the Doctor Who
[41:52] prescribed the right medication for the
[41:54] church
[41:57] in Acts chapter 2 he said repent and be
[42:00] baptized every one of
[42:02] you in the name of Jesus Christ and your
[42:06] sin shall be forgiven and you will
[42:08] receive the gift of the ho ghost so you
[42:10] see was Dr
[42:12] Peter giving a
[42:15] prescription as as according to the
[42:18] Healer so you see if you go and ask
[42:21] counsel from
[42:24] anyone because they look good some
[42:27] people when they are
[42:29] poor and they squeezed to the
[42:32] world they go to a brother who is
[42:35] Rich they got a sister who is Rich guide
[42:39] me what can I do they may be rich they
[42:43] may not know how to make you
[42:46] rich but you see you have to go to the
[42:49] Lord and the Lord has set in the church
[42:53] they write office for
[42:55] that many times people have problems in
[42:57] their
[42:59] marriages they are calling
[43:01] friends they are calling
[43:04] friends they're calling
[43:06] mother-in-laws they're calling you know

[43:12] to
[43:13] do go to the right
[43:16] office God is God God is able God cannot
[43:22] fail but you see you have to follow his
[43:25] principles
[43:27] if you don't follow his
[43:29] principle he is not responsible for your
[43:33] condition but if you follow God's
[43:36] principle he will always be responsible
[43:39] for your
[43:40] situation and he will always prove
[43:43] himself to be a living
[43:46] God and a God who answers

[44:05] disciples was the was was the type of
[44:07] the real
[44:09] believer and we find them here in John
[44:12] 6
[44:15] 67 where he says then said Jesus unto
[44:18] the 12 will you also go
[44:23] away then Simon answered him
[44:27] Lord to whom shall we
[44:30] go thou Hast the words of eternal
[44:34] life and we believe and
[44:37] assure that you are the
[44:40] Christ the son of the
[44:43] living and I want to say the believer
[44:46] will always believe the
[44:50] word the believer will always say to
[44:54] whom shall we go the believer Noh else
[44:57] to

[45:11] have nowhere else to go but to the
[45:15] Lord amen you because why he has words
[45:18] of eternal
[45:20] life and he said we believe and we
[45:24] assure how many believe and assure
[45:28] the Bible says that he that comes to God
[45:32] must believe that he
[45:33] is and he's a
[45:36] rewarder of those who diligently
[45:39] seek we
[45:41] believe and we are
[45:43] sure we do not believe just for
[45:47] just we
[45:49] believe with all our heart and we are
[45:52] sure that this Bible
[45:55] works that our God
[45:57] works he's a living
[46:00] God he can never
[46:02] fail the Bible says all those who trust
[46:06] in him shall never be
[46:10] confounded we
[46:12] believe and we are
[46:14] sure amen and in paragraph six it says
[46:17] for not only did he have the words of
[46:22] life he was the words of life
[46:28] he was the words of
[46:29] life and Simon thoroughly recognized
[46:34] this how many recognize this
[46:37] tonight amen and when he recognized it
[46:42] that that was the that was what that
[46:46] kept his
[46:49] hold recognizing that that Jesus that he
[46:54] is the word of life
[46:57] it will keep your hold of
[46:59] him because it was revealed to
[47:03] him that he was the Living
[47:06] Word I have a testimony this evening it
[47:10] is revealed to me he is the Living
[47:14] World I cannot find life anywhere
[47:17] else I cannot find life in
[47:21] denominations I cannot find life in
[47:24] Creeds in dogmas
[47:27] in
[47:28] organizations but my life is in the
[47:31] living
[47:33] world amen amen now that is a genuine
[47:39] believer let me tell you you believe if
[47:42] you believe the
[47:43] word you will know one
[47:46] thing the word of God will defeat
[47:51] Satan anywhere in any situation at any
[47:55] time the word of God can never
[48:00] fail if you a Believer if you're a
[48:04] genuine believer you will believe that
[48:06] to be the
[48:08] truth hallelujah amen when the Holy
[48:11] Spirit not some someone persuading some
[48:14] other
[48:22] person I'm not here because I was
[48:25] persuaded
[48:28] persuaded me to be
[48:34] here hallelujah hallelujah amen that is
[48:39] why sometimes preachers get
[48:42] anointed when they get into the world
[48:45] and they tell you if you don't want go
[48:49] away and you think he doesn't like
[48:51] people no it's only because
[48:54] God loves genuine
[48:59] believers who will have a
[49:01] backbone to stand and believe every word
[49:04] of
[49:06] God praise the
[49:10] Lord but when the Holy Spirit has
[49:13] revealed to you the word
[49:16] itself let me tell you
[49:19] Brethren the Holy Spirit reveals the
[49:21] word to
[49:24] you we don't believe this by
[49:27] some persuasion or
[49:32] whatever the Holy Spirit has revealed
[49:36] it and you see the word made
[49:39] plain you see the word
[49:43] Vindicated then the spirit of
[49:46] God come getting to that
[49:49] agge for the word of that
[49:53] age and he makes it manifested
[49:58] Oh Glory to God how can a man kept from
[50:01] believing Luther how can a man be kept
[50:03] from believing Luther if he had known
[50:10] that Luther was a
[50:13] reformer the spirit the man's Spirit
[50:16] went forth there for
[50:20] information you know there are four
[50:22] living creatures anointings
[50:26] amen the face of
[50:28] man the
[50:30] ox and and um what
[50:32] else the the the flying ego
[50:36] and what else the lion and so we Noti
[50:40] that in the first
[50:43] age the anointing of a
[50:46] lion and then after that came the
[50:49] ox then after that came the the the the
[50:51] face of
[50:53] man the intelligence knowledge
[50:57] wisdom and then after that comes the
[50:59] flying ego
[51:01] anointed now we are living in the age of
[51:04] the flying ego
[51:07] anointing we are the church going to go
[51:11] in the
[51:12] Rapture when the enemy comes in like a
[51:15] flly the spirit of God raises a
[51:18] standard the standard is going to raise
[51:20] for our
[51:22] generation is not to
[51:24] die no more than
[51:28] our anointing is to fly
[51:32] away that is the
[51:34] standard God is going to raise for Our
[51:37] Generation soon and very soon we are
[51:40] going to see the
[51:42] king we shall have no more
[51:44] suffering no more pain we will see the
[51:48] king we will be perfect even as he
[51:52] is but in the days of Luther
[51:56] anointing that they had of
[51:59] reformation no man could be kept away
[52:01] from
[52:03] it after the Lord had made it manifest
[52:06] Before Their
[52:08] Eyes even in the days of
[52:11] Wiz the same way the people at that time
[52:15] had to believe
[52:17] it that was the message to that church
[52:21] age that was exactly what was to
[52:25] happen was to take
[52:27] place you had to believe
[52:30] it and here we are now down in the
[52:34] laudation church
[52:35] age and we are
[52:37] taugh in the Lan age that Christ was put
[52:42] out of his
[52:45] church and was even knocking on the
[52:49] door trying to get back
[52:53] in this is the situation
[52:56] Our Generation so when we see that
[53:00] happening we know what age we are living
[53:04] in churches who claim to believe in
[53:08] Jesus but they have kicked the word out
[53:11] of their
[53:13] churches Christ is out of the
[53:16] Church
[53:17] Believers who claim to believe in
[53:20] Jesus but they don't leave their lives
[53:23] according to the word
[53:26] have kicked out Jesus out of their life
[53:30] and he says he's out of the
[53:32] church he's outside and he's knocking on
[53:34] the
[53:36] door and then we see what time we are
[53:39] living
[53:40] in and then we are at the closing of the
[53:42] history of the
[53:47] world take a moment and think about
[53:49] it we are at a time of the closing of

[1:03:22] in and then we have another group
[1:03:26] the
[1:03:28] unbeliever and we see those as says the
[1:03:36] 7 praise the
[1:03:38] Lord and I'll continue reading 139 it
[1:03:41] says then
[1:03:43] secondly there comes now the
[1:03:46] unbeliever let's speak of the unbeliever
[1:03:49] next what does the unbeliever
[1:03:52] do we see the
[1:03:54] believer what accepts the word every
[1:03:57] rest every generation from all the way
[1:04:01] from Noah the way all the way up we
[1:04:04] could take six months of of Revival on
[1:04:06] on that
[1:04:09] right bringing up the
[1:04:11] characters they
[1:04:13] believe amen the believer doesn't
[1:04:17] question the believer believes it
[1:04:19] regardless of what it sounds
[1:04:21] like or what anybody else has got to say
[1:04:24] about it how impossible it seems to be
[1:04:28] the believer believes it believes what
[1:04:31] the
[1:04:32] word not the Creed the word not the
[1:04:36] denomination the word not that some not
[1:04:40] what somebody else
[1:04:41] says what the word
[1:04:44] says now remember that is the believer
[1:04:48] the believer doesn't question the
[1:04:50] believer doesn't say how can it be it
[1:04:53] can get can it be explained
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:04:57] that's the
[1:04:58] unbeliever it is the believer that no
[1:05:01] matter what it
[1:05:02] is if it is the word it is the word that
[1:05:07] is
[1:05:08] true that is the
[1:05:10] believer amen now the
[1:05:13] unbeliever now we see we will take up
[1:05:16] the unbelievers now we find out that
[1:05:19] they did all right as long as they get
[1:05:22] parted on the back and called Disciples
[1:05:28] as long as you you you encourage
[1:05:31] them it is all right it will be all
[1:05:35] right even if you are doing it is not
[1:05:38] wor the belever the unbelievers love
[1:05:42] inspirational
[1:05:44] preachers those ones who make them
[1:05:46] comfortable in their
[1:05:48] sin those on who don't condemn them
[1:05:52] those who don't judge them but you see
[1:05:56] the
[1:05:57] nonbelievers as long as everything went
[1:06:01] fine they were all right but when this
[1:06:04] Prophet that they believe to be a
[1:06:07] prophet that know
[1:06:10] was that could
[1:06:13] SEC excuse me what did he do when the
[1:06:16] real
[1:06:18] truth and the re
[1:06:22] come contrary to what the unbeliever
[1:06:24] believes
[1:06:27] they cannot take the
[1:06:30] word those are the ones who get offended
[1:06:33] when you preach the truth of the
[1:06:37] word if they are
[1:06:40] fornicating and you tell them
[1:06:41] fornication is a sin and fornicators are
[1:06:44] going to
[1:06:47] hell I don't want
[1:06:50] that that pass
[1:06:53] judgmental that is the nonbeliever
[1:06:58] but the believer if he was
[1:07:01] fornicating he the
[1:07:04] word
[1:07:05] God because to him the word is the
[1:07:10] word and he believes it and takes it the
[1:07:13] way it
[1:07:15] is are you hearing me
[1:07:19] church so the
[1:07:23] nonbeliever they can take miracles
[1:07:27] they can even perform
[1:07:28] them that no problem that they they went
[1:07:32] and cast out
[1:07:34] Devils they preached even the
[1:07:37] word and they were still
[1:07:41] unbelievers n Believers can even
[1:07:44] preach n Believers can even do
[1:07:48] Miracles but still
[1:07:50] non how do you know them by their
[1:07:54] life I don't care whether you preach
[1:07:56] Hell
[1:07:57] Fire or miracles
[1:08:00] happen your
[1:08:02] life shows who you really
[1:08:06] are an
[1:08:08] unbeliever cannot live the
[1:08:11] life of the
[1:08:13] word you see he sent them out two by
[1:08:16] two the servant and they cast
[1:08:19] out and he said I seen seven
[1:08:23] falling like like in from
[1:08:27] heaven and then they casted
[1:08:31] Devils but as soon
[1:08:33] as you know Judas was right with them
[1:08:36] and here comes the
[1:08:39] unbelievers as soon as Jesus begin to
[1:08:42] say he was
[1:08:44] something then he was the
[1:08:46] resurrection he was the life what would
[1:08:49] you say if you seen the son of man
[1:08:51] Ascend up from from where he come from
[1:08:57] now this man is trying to say he comes
[1:09:00] from
[1:09:02] Heaven that's too much for
[1:09:04] us we can't believe
[1:09:07] that he said what is it the flesh that
[1:09:11] you are talking
[1:09:12] about profit
[1:09:14] nothing it's the spirit that
[1:09:16] quickens there you are the spirit
[1:09:19] quickens the
[1:09:21] word it is the spirit not the
[1:09:25] the spirit of the Holy
[1:09:28] Ghost quickens the word to
[1:09:32] you and the nonbeliever cannot receive
[1:09:35] that Spirit of
[1:09:39] Truth and then when he comes he quickens
[1:09:41] and you become
[1:09:44] alive and there you are you see
[1:09:48] it by faith you see
[1:09:50] it you know it is so because the word
[1:09:53] said so
[1:09:56] and the spirit quickens the word to
[1:10:00] you now he said and as soon as we did
[1:10:03] this we find out the unbelievers when
[1:10:05] you say something that they don't agree
[1:10:08] with they walk right out on
[1:10:13] you I just
[1:10:15] want oh that's getting so
[1:10:19] dense it's getting so in the world today
[1:10:27] excuse
[1:10:28] me in the
[1:10:30] world it is getting so dense
[1:10:35] now they gather
[1:10:37] in I notice at meetings they gather
[1:10:41] in great
[1:10:42] crowds and you stand up and start saying
[1:10:46] something they just sit
[1:10:48] there just watching just waiting then as
[1:10:53] soon as you say
[1:10:56] now Jesus Christ identified himself as
[1:11:00] Messiah because he was a
[1:11:03] prophet that is
[1:11:08] done away it
[1:11:11] goes and where they
[1:11:13] go what is it
[1:11:18] unbelievers you say something it is in
[1:11:20] the
[1:11:21] word but instead of them receiving it
[1:11:25] they are
[1:11:27] offended have you not seen some of those
[1:11:30] people they just get
[1:11:34] offended off I'm offended you have
[1:11:36] offended me
[1:11:40] I'm speak about me it is
[1:11:44] impossible even these churches have left
[1:11:47] them I say will never come back he
[1:11:50] abused
[1:11:53] me unbeliever
[1:11:57] the unbeliever doesn't even wait
[1:12:00] around when the word is
[1:12:03] preached he is
[1:12:05] condemned and he walks
[1:12:08] out sometimes they even
[1:12:11] physically they walk
[1:12:14] away you even see them many times in
[1:12:17] services and this happens in every
[1:12:19] Church in the
[1:12:22] world during
[1:12:24] services when it begins to become so
[1:12:28] hot you see some people walking up those
[1:12:32] are
[1:12:33] unbelievers
[1:12:35] them when the you
[1:12:37] want the word is begin to get
[1:12:40] sweet this is where we enjoying and
[1:12:43] someone is walking
[1:12:46] out they're making themselves
[1:12:51] busy non believers
[1:12:55] why they are condemned by the word and
[1:12:58] they feel
[1:13:01] uncomfortable oh
[1:13:03] God and this message of the
[1:13:06] hour that we are now
[1:13:08] enjoying the presence of God the latter
[1:13:13] day the evening time when the lights are
[1:13:17] shining and the things that been open to
[1:13:20] us and the word
[1:13:23] Vindicated and the word Pro Pro to be
[1:13:25] the
[1:13:26] truth both
[1:13:29] prophesied comes to
[1:13:31] pass all through scientific and
[1:13:35] everything it proved it is Jesus Christ
[1:13:40] the same yesterday today and
[1:13:43] forever and a man walk out on
[1:13:47] that he is an
[1:13:51] unbeliever and the prophet continues he
[1:13:55] is beyond
[1:13:56] [Applause]
[1:13:58] hopes he is numed by the power of
[1:14:03] Satan so there is no hopes
[1:14:06] for he is beyond
[1:14:10] hopes there is no more
[1:14:13] grace because the revelation of the
[1:14:16] world in our generation is the highest
[1:14:20] form of
[1:14:23] Grace if anyone was to walk away from
[1:14:26] it no more
[1:14:30] hopes for
[1:14:32] them they are
[1:14:35] nonbelievers they unarmed by the power
[1:14:38] of
[1:14:40] Satan and there's no more hopes
[1:14:43] for oh God make me
[1:14:47] a and then we'll close it down with a
[1:14:49] make

[1:28:18] her to betray
[1:28:20] her that was Satan and here Satan is is
[1:28:25] in the form of Judas in that age that
[1:28:29] was
[1:28:30] certain in the first age what was he
[1:28:34] agreeing with the
[1:28:36] word not believing
[1:28:41] it the
[1:28:46] word agreeing with the
[1:28:49] word with a word not believing

[1:29:30] what Judas finds right
[1:29:33] now he will come right along with the
[1:29:37] meeting and watch right around until he
[1:29:40] can find that little
[1:29:45] spot oh there it
[1:29:47] is that's it that's the way it is done
[1:29:51] just exactly and I want to finish
[1:29:54] tonight with a story that gives of make
[1:29:59] believer you are going to be
[1:30:01] amazed but the BAM says many of you
[1:30:03] remember up there at that night when
[1:30:06] that man came out on the
[1:30:10] platform and you know brother bam had a
[1:30:12] gift of
[1:30:15] designment where he would tell people
[1:30:17] their
[1:30:18] names their address their problem and he
[1:30:22] would pronounce them heal
[1:30:25] if they had any
[1:30:27] problem and so you would be able to
[1:30:28] detect each and every
[1:30:31] sickness by the power of the Holy
[1:30:33] Spirit but here is a story of a me
[1:30:38] believer who came in
[1:30:41] church he thought that there was a
[1:30:44] mental telepathy of reading the prayer
[1:30:49] [Music]
[1:30:52] card brother bam
[1:30:54] campaign he had little prayer
[1:30:58] cards where in the ear days they would
[1:31:00] write the sicknesses of the
[1:31:02] people that is before he started to have
[1:31:06] the the designment when he was just
[1:31:07] using the gift of the
[1:31:14] hand and so in the middle there so
[1:31:16] sometimes they would still write the
[1:31:21] needs and so you thought that there was
[1:31:23] a so this man came and you know he
[1:31:25] thought brother bam was reading the
[1:31:27] prayer
[1:31:31] card and so brother he was sure he had
[1:31:35] it and he come around he belonged to a
[1:31:38] church that don't even believe in this
[1:31:40] in the gospel the Full
[1:31:42] Gospel and he came up on the
[1:31:45] platform I was
[1:31:47] tired they was fixing to take me
[1:31:50] away that was at winds Ontario in Canada
[1:31:55] in there come right across from the
[1:31:56] United States this man he came right
[1:31:58] from Detroit in
[1:32:00] wind at he came in America and this man
[1:32:05] come up there with a gray suit
[1:32:09] on and a red
[1:32:11] tie intelligent looking
[1:32:15] man smart as a
[1:32:18] tack he come to the platform and he
[1:32:21] walked up and I said
[1:32:24] well just let me have your
[1:32:27] hand I said I'm
[1:32:30] tired I've seen so many Visions just let
[1:32:33] me have your hand and I never noticed
[1:32:36] the
[1:32:37] man and he put his hand over on
[1:32:41] M and I said
[1:32:43] sir there is nothing wrong with
[1:32:47] you go ahead go
[1:32:50] go he said there is two
[1:32:55] and I said well let me see there I said
[1:32:58] no
[1:32:59] sir there is not one
[1:33:02] sign no sir you are a healthy
[1:33:07] man he said go look at my prayer
[1:33:13] card I said I don't care what you put on
[1:33:16] your prayer
[1:33:17] card I don't have nothing to do with the
[1:33:20] prayer
[1:33:22] card you know not you know I was tired
[1:33:25] and wore
[1:33:26] out but by the grace of God you see
[1:33:29] still there the grace of God was still
[1:33:32] there you remember if he sends
[1:33:35] you if God sends
[1:33:38] you it is his
[1:33:40] obligation to take care of
[1:33:43] you it ain't mine it is
[1:33:47] him he sent it I'm just supposed to
[1:33:51] stand on what's true
[1:33:54] when Moses threw his sck
[1:33:56] down it turned into a serpent The
[1:33:59] Magicians did the same
[1:34:03] thing what could Moses do but stand
[1:34:07] there and wait for the grace of
[1:34:10] God that is all same thing and that's
[1:34:14] what we do as
[1:34:15] preachers we preach the word and we
[1:34:18] stand there and we wait for the grace of
[1:34:21] God if the bible promises healing
[1:34:24] I preach healing and then I wait for the
[1:34:27] grace of God Amen I preach Miracles and
[1:34:31] then I wait for the of you know it's not
[1:34:34] my obligation to do it it is God who
[1:34:38] gave the
[1:34:42] word and he says and you know what
[1:34:44] happened don't you this man said now he
[1:34:49] said there he is look at my prayer
[1:34:52] card I said well you might have had a
[1:34:55] lot of
[1:34:57] faith and might have done it not
[1:35:01] thinking you know I was saying
[1:35:04] that and I wasn't even paying
[1:35:08] attention then he un buttons his
[1:35:11] coat and he pushed out his chest and he
[1:35:18] said to the
[1:35:21] audience and I thought what's going on
[1:35:25] there he looked around he said there you
[1:35:30] are see the
[1:35:33] gimick that is your
[1:35:37] Judas religious man a preacher of a
[1:35:41] great
[1:35:42] denomination he said there you
[1:35:46] are I had so much
[1:35:49] Faith now he's got so weak he can't read
[1:35:51] the telepathy
[1:35:55] he didn't even come to him no
[1:35:58] more and there he said it's not my faith
[1:36:01] was so
[1:36:04] great it is not my faith was so
[1:36:08] great said I put that on my prayer
[1:36:12] card and now he can't
[1:36:15] catch you
[1:36:17] see that's
[1:36:20] the and brother is standing
[1:36:23] all
[1:36:28] embarrassed you know what that
[1:36:31] means to an international
[1:36:34] evangelist someone who is believed to
[1:36:36] have a gift of
[1:36:38] God and someone comes and embarrasses
[1:36:40] him like
[1:36:42] this to prove that he's not a
[1:36:45] genuine you know brother if you're
[1:36:47] genuine
[1:36:49] believer stand with the word God will
[1:36:52] always give you the grace
[1:36:55] he can never let those who trust in him
[1:36:57] to be
[1:36:59] [Music]
[1:37:01] confounded
[1:37:04] never and I thought what is going
[1:37:08] on and then the grace of God
[1:37:13] came and I
[1:37:16] said
[1:37:17] sir why has the devil put in your heart
[1:37:22] [Music]
[1:37:23] to try to deceive
[1:37:26] God a
[1:37:29] Judas I said and then began to design
[1:37:36] him let those who say was a first
[1:37:42] preacher they are playing with
[1:37:48] fire and they says you are of the Church
[1:37:50] of
[1:37:52] Christ and said oh excuse
[1:37:55] me well I've already said it he didn't
[1:37:58] want to say the
[1:38:01] name but he said you of the Church of
[1:38:03] Christ
[1:38:04] preacher he was even a
[1:38:07] preacher you belong to the Church of
[1:38:10] Christ and you from the United
[1:38:13] States and that man sitting up
[1:38:17] there with that blue suit
[1:38:19] on and your wife sitting there
[1:38:24] you sat together that man and your wife
[1:38:27] at the
[1:38:29] table last
[1:38:32] night that man that has a green thing
[1:38:35] over
[1:38:37] it I spread you know it says around
[1:38:41] where you sat there was like a spread a
[1:38:42] green
[1:38:45] sheet and you made up that this was
[1:38:50] telepathy and you were coming tonight
[1:38:55] and that man raised up he said that's
[1:38:58] the Havey on
[1:39:00] me I said
[1:39:04] sir now this is the real designment
[1:39:08] now the man wrote things on the
[1:39:11] paper even look
[1:39:14] at but he begins to read what is
[1:39:18] there what this man was calling
[1:39:20] telepathy
[1:39:25] don't
[1:39:25] despise the
[1:39:28] supernatural whether it is a prophecy T
[1:39:32] interpretation the word God is
[1:39:36] God despise not the
[1:39:40] supernatural always believe the
[1:39:46] super and I said sir you put TB and
[1:39:50] cancer
[1:39:54] on that
[1:39:55] c and now you have
[1:39:59] it it is your
[1:40:03] now T and
[1:40:06] canc remember the man didn't have
[1:40:08] it he wrote it to
[1:40:11] confuse he thought brother bam was
[1:40:13] reading the
[1:40:17] mind and he grabbed me by the
[1:40:21] pants and he said
[1:40:24] I said I and I said I can't help
[1:40:29] you you go right
[1:40:31] ahead that's up between you and
[1:40:35] God you wrote your doom right on your
[1:40:38] [Music]
[1:40:40] car and that got
[1:40:44] him that was all of
[1:40:48] it see make believers
[1:40:54] trying to find fault with God and His
[1:40:58] word that is the
[1:41:01] Judas that's the ones you see how Judas
[1:41:03] come
[1:41:04] out
[1:41:06] Judas you see how he come out how that
[1:41:09] guy come out that's the way the make
[1:41:12] Believers
[1:41:15] happen make believers they highly
[1:41:18] educated sometimes and a good shown come
[1:41:21] between the word and their Creed
[1:41:27] when it does they sell out to their
[1:41:33] denomination like
[1:41:37] Jud Jud sold out to his
[1:41:42] denomination so Jesus he sold the
[1:41:46] word to his denomination he betrayed
[1:41:49] Jesus Christ after he claimed to be a
[1:41:52] part of the
[1:41:55] word ministers sometimes claiming to be
[1:41:57] Servants of
[1:42:00] Christ and when the word and we have
[1:42:02] seen them sometimes they have come even
[1:42:04] in this message 30 years and
[1:42:07] above and then they say why I left the
[1:42:12] message then they begin to find errors
[1:42:14] with the
[1:42:15] message then they begin to find
[1:42:17] questions with the message I have always
[1:42:20] said this whatever they claim that they
[1:42:22] know from the
[1:42:25] it is because of the message of William
[1:42:28] Bram we are not followers of William
[1:42:32] Bram we are followers of Jesus
[1:42:36] Christ the message of brother
[1:42:39] Bram pointed us to the
[1:42:42] word there is no way we can reject that
[1:42:46] message and claim to believe in Jesus
[1:42:50] and the word and reject the message of
[1:42:54] we are make Believers if we try to do
[1:42:57] that and brother Bram never preached
[1:43:01] anything
[1:43:02] new all the teachings all the
[1:43:06] revelations
[1:43:08] that from the
[1:43:11] Bible remember he was
[1:43:14] Elijah the one that was supposed to
[1:43:18] Resto
[1:43:19] all
[1:43:21] Resto doesn't mean to bring something
[1:43:24] new it means to bring what was already
[1:43:29] there but was
[1:43:32] lost and this message restores the
[1:43:35] fullness of the
[1:43:37] world so we are real Bible
[1:43:41] Believers because of the
[1:43:44] message and I am not ashamed to say I
[1:43:48] believe the message of William Bram
[1:43:53] because it has pointed me to
[1:43:56] Christ that the denominations had taken
[1:43:59] away from
[1:44:01] me and I finish with this quote now it's
[1:44:04] the same quote I'm just
[1:44:06] finishing and he said and when these
[1:44:08] ministers they come claiming to be the
[1:44:10] Servants of
[1:44:12] Christ and when the word is Thoroughly
[1:44:15] identified to be Vindicated for that
[1:44:20] day that it is the message of the hour
[1:44:24] and they would sell
[1:44:26] out for
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:30] popularity to their denomination they go
[1:44:33] back to their
[1:44:35] denomination that's exactly like Judas
[1:44:38] did they betrayed Jesus to the
[1:44:41] phes
[1:44:43] and that Spirit don't
[1:44:46] die so there that's Among Us
[1:44:49] Believers make a Believers and
[1:44:52] unbeliever
[1:44:54] see that's exactly they come right down
[1:44:56] and sold Jesus for 30 pieces of
[1:45:00] silver and many men will do it
[1:45:04] today for a meal ticket for an extra
[1:45:06] $100 a
[1:45:08] week they deny the word that's standing
[1:45:11] in the midst of
[1:45:13] them and B that that b their
[1:45:18] life this word our
[1:45:23] with a full
[1:45:24] word but they reject it they turn back
[1:45:28] to their
[1:45:29] denominations some of them go back right
[1:45:32] they go back to believe in the
[1:45:33] Trinity they go back to believing women
[1:45:36] preachers believing all these things
[1:45:38] that the Bible is
[1:45:42] against why because they make
[1:45:46] believer and then you like
[1:45:48] huh someone who was preaching this
[1:45:51] message for 30 40
[1:45:55] years what happened don't be
[1:45:58] surprised it happened in the days of
[1:46:02] Jesus someone who you can say Jesus
[1:46:04] trusted more than anybody
[1:46:06] else you don't tell
[1:46:09] someone to keep the P if they not
[1:46:14] trustworthy Judas was a
[1:46:16] trustworthy he was a good man he hanged
[1:46:20] on when the S left he was around he was
[1:46:24] among them who said when Peter said
[1:46:29] where can we go to whom has the words of
[1:46:31] etal
[1:46:33] life was
[1:46:36] saying he was a me
[1:46:39] believer later on he showed where his
[1:46:43] true heart
[1:46:45] was his heart was on the
[1:46:48] money and when he got someone to give
[1:46:51] him 30 pieces of silver
[1:46:55] he said I collect it I'll collect it and
[1:46:59] then he went to Jesus and he said my
[1:47:06] Lord I love you very
[1:47:08] much he could not betray
[1:47:11] him by cutting off his head he still
[1:47:14] loved him so these people
[1:47:18] confusing are they Believers or not they
[1:47:21] make themselves believers
[1:47:23] and they around
[1:47:24] us and they they keep there they
[1:47:28] patients who never get
[1:47:33] well but they they around all
[1:47:36] the they never get well brother Des s to
[1:47:40] be a mega
[1:47:43] believer someone in church 2 years 5
