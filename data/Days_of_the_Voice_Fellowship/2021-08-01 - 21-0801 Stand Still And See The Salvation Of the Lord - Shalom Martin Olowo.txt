the hell of your god with your father and may you move on on their behalf i pray may you move the mountain away even as we have heard this daily alone even as you amen told death to stand still there's hard to stand oh jesus just had to give way even when you came down there to call out the name of lazarus if you are not called lazarus would have raised from the dead that day because that was the voice of resurrection i know that voice of resurrection is right here here today in our generation in the in the name of our lord jesus god to christ out of your great hands i command you

glory and crazy oh hallelujah thank you lord jesus amen wonderful saints amen hallelujah may the lord bless you and uh just someone reminded me here uh we are sorry we we we we we are in the new normal and i especially myself i usually forget the offerings that the tithe is the only brother that reminds me and uh so uh i think i'll let our left brother uh uh do this part and close as well and pray for the offerings and those who will give him their titles as well we are going to project the number for you on the screen and as our brother prays and commits the offerings and the titus before the lord okay i think those are the numbers you already have the numbers on the screen yes god bless you brethren we want to appreciate god for such a wonderful moment in his presence i believe you're holding your tithes and offering the bible says that he who gives food to the eater gives seed to the sower and the bible says that as long as there is life there shall be seed sowing and reaping and the bible says in malachi chapter 3 from the 9th verse that we should bring our tithes and offerings into the house of god that we should test him and see and right now let us pray precious kind loving heavenly father we want to thank you for the opportunity you have given us as your children lord for the opportunity to give in your house king of glory father thank you very much lord for sure you have been so good to us lord you have provided for us lord you have given us health lord you have given us food lord we have have been so good to us lord and even at this moment as we are getting of that which have given us lord we pray for your blessing lord the bible says that when we give lord you will you will lord rebuke the devourer in the name of jesus christ then you promise that you will open the floodgates of heaven father i pray lord in every hand of every man and every woman of every child of every boy and girl that are giving in the cause of your kingdom lord but i pray may you king of glory bless their hearts lord may you bless their pockets lord may you bless their homes lord let their homes never load luck in the name of jesus christ lord father even when the children of israel were in a moment they were the worst with when they were in the desert lord but father by your word lord you provided for them father i pray for your children lord may you continue to provide for them lord and even those that are probably whose jobs were open that are going to work on monday lord father we pray for your blessing to go with them lord may you go before them lord with the pillar of fire king of glory guide them lord fight for their battles lord them lord that really are loki are standing at the shores of the red sea and they don't know what to do father king of
