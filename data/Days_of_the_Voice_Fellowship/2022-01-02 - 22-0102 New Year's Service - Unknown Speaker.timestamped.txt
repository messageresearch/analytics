[1:19] sing a special song but maybe because of
[1:21] time maybe god willing next sunday
[1:25] praise god brethren
[1:27] yeah i'm also happy to stand before you
[1:31] uh this morning
[1:33] and i thank god
[1:36] for the battles we've gone through
[1:38] that past year
[1:40] it was quite a battle praise you to god
[1:44] i too have something somehow similar to
[1:47] the one of brother luanga
[1:49] because we came from the same
[1:51] fellowship
[1:55] and
[1:58] it was not easy
[2:01] you know one thing i know
[2:03] god speaks to an individual
[2:06] and when god speaks to your heart you
[2:09] will not need to convince the whole
[2:11] world
[2:12] that god spoke to me
[2:14] praise be to god
[2:17] i remember uh
[2:19] like two years back
[2:22] because for me to move this way i took
[2:24] something like one
[2:26] one year and i think some two months or
[2:28] three months
[2:30] because i was still waiting on god
[2:34] but finally when that time
[2:37] ripen i had to
[2:39] uh inform my
[2:41] former pastor that uh i think now is the
[2:43] time for me to move
[2:46] and friends it was quite an experience
[2:50] praise be to god
[2:52] when i left there
[2:55] when i talked to him
[2:59] he
[2:59] gave me his mind
[3:03] so uh it was now me to decide what to do
[3:08] but within when i was still at his place
[3:10] because i went i met him at his home
[3:13] and then he gave me his mind
[3:16] but when i was still there i believe god
[3:19] spoke to me
[3:21] i just had something reminding me about
[3:23] a scenario
[3:25] which happened in the message
[3:28] one day brother branham was going
[3:31] god was calling him to go somewhere for
[3:34] ministry
[3:36] and
[3:37] the mother-in-law
[3:39] refused told him that you cannot
[3:42] take my daughter to that trash
[3:44] praise be to god
[3:46] and somehow because brother paul would
[3:48] not want to hurt the mother in law
[3:51] he did not listen to the voice of god
[3:53] and what followed it almost
[3:56] took his life
[3:58] he lost
[3:59] his daughter wife and
[4:02] even himself almost when
[4:04] so when i was still there thinking about
[4:06] it
[4:07] that same thing spoke to me
[4:10] it was it was as
[4:12] strong just like the voice of somebody
[4:16] that remember
[4:18] brother branham and
[4:20] the
[4:21] in-law saga
[4:23] praise be to god so i went home and
[4:25] thought about it
[4:26] when i shared with my wife
[4:28] at first
[4:30] uh
[4:32] she did not swallow it
[4:35] because of her reasons
[4:37] praise be to god you know it's always
[4:39] not easy
[4:41] but uh i i personally god know
[4:44] my heart
[4:46] i and i believe
[4:48] i was sincere
[4:50] i'd not move this way because of other
[4:53] things
[4:54] but because i wanted to serve god
[4:58] you will ask me but not because i was
[5:00] not serving god there
[5:03] i was serving god
[5:06] but time came
[5:09] and uh
[5:11] i kind of
[5:15] was not fully in the service
[5:19] but now when this time this time around
[5:22] i just felt like it was now the right
[5:23] time for me to rise and do something for
[5:26] god
[5:27] so when i shared with my wife
[5:29] yeah she was
[5:30] 50 50.
[5:32] i left it on her
[5:34] but i trusted god and i kept praying for
[5:37] high in my heart
[5:40] knowing that one day
[5:42] god
[5:44] will speak to our heart
[5:46] praise be to god
[5:47] you know it's always not easy to leave
[5:49] the church where you have been for years
[5:51] you have friends
[5:53] and they also threaten you with what see
[5:55] when you go half brother your future is
[5:57] buried everything uh
[5:59] i mean they are attacks not from the
[6:02] pastor
[6:03] but the people think that they're
[6:05] helping pastor
[6:07] to find they're there to try to convince
[6:09] you
[6:10] but one thing i know
[6:11] a christian is supposed to follow the
[6:13] leadership of the holy spirit
[6:15] and to listen to the voice of god
[6:18] because when you don't listen the verse
[6:19] of gonna listen to the voice of men
[6:21] there is a weep but when that weep comes
[6:23] brother it it's always not easy praise
[6:26] be to god
[6:27] but i thank god that enabled me to move
[6:29] this way
[6:31] and for sure
[6:32] i'm happy i thank god for our pastor
[6:36] he's such a loving
[6:38] pastor
[6:40] and
[6:41] he's always attached to
[6:44] the flock
[6:46] you always want to know what's happening
[6:48] around each and every one of us
[6:51] and also i thank god for this ministry
[6:52] personally it has not
[6:55] i'm not
[6:56] the same that's what i can say
[7:00] i believe
[7:02] i'm moving somewhere
[7:04] i remember on 21st my wife made a
[7:06] statement
[7:08] and to say that when she was coming
[7:10] she didn't know that
[7:13] she would get the word which will really
[7:16] make her
[7:17] heart
[7:18] fully
[7:20] but now
[7:21] she thank god for me it was such a big
[7:24] testimony
[7:26] yeah because
[7:27] some people thought that this thing was
[7:29] not was
[7:38] there is no trust
[7:40] that you can give somebody
[7:42] trusting someone with your soul
[7:46] that he is capable
[7:49] to lead you
[7:50] with your family
[7:52] until eternity
[7:54] my friends
[7:56] that is
[7:58] one of the biggest trust you can
[8:00] put in somebody
[8:02] so you cannot just risk yourself and say
[8:04] let me go with this
[8:05] praise be to god
[8:07] because soul we only have one soul
[8:11] but i thank god that i'm fully convinced
[8:13] and persuaded
[8:15] that he will lead us
[8:17] through
[8:20] praise be to god
[8:21] because we have got the word
[8:23] we have also we tested him by the word
[8:27] and we don't have any doubt
[8:29] so i thank god he has fought for me
[8:31] battles last year there were many
[8:33] battles he escaped with my family also
[8:36] thank god for my wife
[8:38] i know you know sometime maybe
[8:40] somewhere some are things go wrong
[8:43] but i thank god that they have still
[8:44] kept us together
[8:46] and we are moving
[8:47] on
[8:48] for the better i thank god for each one
[8:51] of you you really have been so good to
[8:53] us
[8:54] you've been
[8:56] brothers mothers
[8:58] sisters
[8:59] to us
[9:01] and may god bless you
[9:03] and maybe where things went wrong here
[9:05] and there
[9:06] and you have it in your heart i'll just
[9:09] ask you to get a place in your heart
[9:11] forgive me
[9:12] because i've never have any intention of
[9:15] hurting
[9:16] anybody
[9:17] but it's my prayer that this year god
[9:19] gives us more grace
[9:21] and give us zeal
[9:22] at least this year by the end of this
[9:24] year let us pray god
[9:26] that we have
[9:28] testimonies of people being filled with
[9:30] the holy spirit
[9:32] praise be to god
[9:34] at least if all of us still we thank god
[9:38] may god bless you
[9:40] and i wish you a blessed sunday
[9:43] amen it's already half past eleven
[9:47] our business is your first time to
[9:48] fellowship with us i just request you to
[9:51] raise your hands

[9:58] just in one minute i request you to

[11:35] are you born again then i told her yes
[11:40] but i'm suffering i i want to go and
[11:42] pray but i don't know where to go

[12:51] children of god
[12:54] the bible says two are better than one
[12:59] can two work together unless they agree
[13:03] so this year agreed to work with god oh
[13:06] my god
[13:07] then you're going to get you a miracle
[13:10] hallelujah amen in the church i'm
[13:13] fellowshipping pentecostal outreach in
[13:16] toronto
[13:34] but what has brought me here i've come
[13:36] to do some small work catalan
[13:41] i am doing engineering um
[13:43] some i have a contract down there
[13:46] called
[14:30] i was just
[14:31] god was reminding me i brought something
[14:34] and i did not finish it in my testimony
[14:36] when i left there some thought that ah
[14:39] that is the end of us but i want to tell
[14:41] you ever since we left there god has
[14:44] been so gracious
[14:45] personally i do uh i do plumbing and
[14:49] also electronics work
[14:51] as well but mainly i'm
[14:54] like i'm measuring in plumbing
[14:56] and uh you know where you have been you
[14:58] have clients there and now it's uh
[15:02] but thanks be to god that god has given
[15:04] me
[15:05] uh clients
[15:09] this way and even those who were not
[15:12] even calling me and even talking to me
[15:14] nowadays we are friends they call me and
[15:17] they realize that uh
[15:19] because personally the bible tells us
[15:21] that we should win evil with the good
[15:24] i'd not show any bad heart or any bad
[15:28] words but i just prayed for them but one
[15:31] thing i thank god of that we are now
[15:33] friends and we are still tight bad days
[15:35] that we used to be
[15:37] god has been so good he has taken care
[15:39] of me with my family
[15:41] all of us we are happy i can say like
[15:43] brother you can look at them and uh
[15:45] israel doesn't look like them
[15:47] that is the grace of god and your
[15:49] prayers
[15:51] so friends
[15:52] the god we are serving
[15:54] is real
[15:56] and i believe we are moving from glory
[15:58] to glory
[16:00] so my friends when you are threatening
[16:01] that now if you go
[16:03] god is speaking to you and the man is
[16:05] also speaking to you
[16:06] but i want to tell that when you take
[16:08] the side of god god always stand by your

[58:21] buys for you street or candies for you
[58:27] to your husband when he does only good
[58:29] things and no bad thing at all
[58:34] the bible here
[59:03] the church and christ
[59:08] because christ is the husband of the
[59:10] church
[59:12] the church is the wife
[59:15] so we all are the wife of jesus
[59:19] do you know we are the church of jesus
[59:20] christ and we are called the wife the
[59:23] bride
[59:25] can you say yes
[59:27] the bible in the book of revelation says
[59:29] that
[59:30] the
[1:00:12] and why do we come to church like this
[1:00:15] we make ourselves ready for the marriage
[1:00:17] of the lamb

[1:00:26] amen
[1:00:59] [Music]
[1:01:09] that love made him a lamp
[1:01:14] what does the lamp do
[1:01:17] is sacrifice
[1:01:20] meaning you can love your wife so much
[1:01:37] [Applause]
[1:02:13] you know jesus christ yes christians
[1:03:41] foreign
[1:03:59] children

[1:04:05] i will tell you this
[1:04:07] before a child marries or gets married
[1:04:38] have given them permission
[1:04:42] that is a god given right to parents
[1:04:47] that's why if a parent doesn't take care
[1:04:49] of their children
[1:04:52] even the
[1:06:02] the father
[1:06:16] but i'm
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:54] says in all things
[1:07:58] moving to beyond now what does it mean
[1:08:01] it means those children who are once
[1:08:03] under their parents
[1:08:08] time will
[1:09:12] so he says if children obey their
[1:09:15] parents
[1:10:14] some words and some things
[1:10:16] [Music]
[1:10:20] you know like in many cultures
[1:10:25] when a father is beating her or
[1:10:27] splitting a child
[1:11:25] obviously
[1:11:27] everyone is a servant in one way or the
[1:11:29] other moon
[1:11:32] should really be a servant
[1:11:36] it says that servants obey in all things
[1:11:39] your masters according to the flesh
[1:11:46] you have people who are believers
[1:11:50] they do not want to obey their side
[1:11:52] their master
[1:11:55] [Music]
[1:12:06] foreign
[1:13:59] a servant
[1:14:00] now it used to be that you see that when
[1:14:03] a woman got married
[1:14:07] she would pick a few girls or one girl
[1:14:10] whichever it is that she wanted to be
[1:14:40] if a man could not have a child with his
[1:14:42] wife
[1:14:48] that the wife could would go to the
[1:14:50] servant
[1:14:54] suggestion
[1:15:44] and so then
[1:15:46] as it was done in many places in the
[1:15:48] bible
[1:15:50] where there come a bible
[1:16:06] [Music]
[1:16:18] so that my husband can give me children
[1:16:24] can you imagine
[1:16:26] this is how it used to be in the bible
[1:16:28] bible and so
[1:16:30] so it happened also with with abraham
[1:17:14] submissive to sarah in all things
[1:17:21] everything

[1:17:26] simply
[1:17:27] nothing
[1:17:55] all about
[1:18:38] the weight would be done ingredients
[1:18:41] all the three were
[1:18:42] present
[1:18:46] and then the woman the servant would
[1:18:48] receive seed cutting
[1:18:50] on her furnace on behalf of the
[1:19:50] my servant is not obeying me
[1:19:54] he's looking at me that way
[1:19:57] and then
[1:19:59] abraham said blaming her and here is how
[1:20:01] the real men are supposed to do in
[1:20:07] [Music]
[1:20:44] please pack up your things go
[1:20:46] go go
[1:20:48] because you allowed us
[1:20:51] and she left now again with ishmael
