struggle we have this evening everlasting you are god [Music] angel [Music] increase our faith lord young the bible says must believe that you are and you are the one of those secrets and prayers become a [Music] amen amen i want to take my reading from the book of joshua chicken next summer joshua now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of noon moses moses minister saying moses my servant is dead and now therefore arise go over the jordan go over this jordan thou and all the people unto the land which i gave to them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your food shall throw upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses from the wilderness and to the lebanon even onto the great river the river is ready in the land of the hittite and onto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee not forsake thee um m [Music] [Music] strong and of good courage for unto the people shall thou shalt thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear and drew father unto their fathers to give them only be thou strong and very courageous and and that thou may uh observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou may prosper whatever thou goest friends who are from himalayas we say that lord is our heartburn within us when he was speaking to us we believe that hebrews 13 8 is still alive that jesus were the same yesterday today in christ jesus we pray amen amina may be seated praise be to god amen amina this evening uh i just have a thought that i want us and we're going to call it fighting for our inheritance praise be to god now therefore arise go over this jordan thou and all these people and to and to the land which i do give to them even to the children of food shall throw upon that have i given unto you as i said unto moses [Music] we are seeing all of us bible readers we know the story about moses god used moses to bring children of israel out of egypt not to destroy them in the wilderness but god had a reason why he called them out god spoke to abraham and told him that he would bring them out of bondage and it would take them to their promised lands praise be to god come here and moses did not marry the promised land he died on the way god told him to climb on the mountain and show them the promised land moses managed to see the land from i mean even in the days we are living in nemo quiznos to him we did not see our moses praise be to god because moses was the prophet is telling him to arise [Music] the promise is yeah they should be the jeffrey but the devil is not willing it's not just going to let you go and take it you will have to fight for every inch of the promise therefore shall not any man be able to stand before thee i will not fail forsake [Applause] christian life is all about fighting over where you can stay on parole you will tell me but the prophet tells us that christianity's all is based on resting but remember before ruth rested if you read more scriptures go so many hours see how god do his things that god could fight for israelites but did not sweep their enemies [Music] is is [Applause] jesus had to fight after [Music] [Applause] how is it with you my brother my sister uh jesus heard you in his mind yes he had me in his mind he knew that when he rested we have to [Music] amen fighting for our inheritance [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Applause] praise there is no [Music] praise be to [Music] but god is not going to do everything for you now you got to understand that he is waiting for you to do something you must move praise be to god amen the prophet tells us but when we mean business with god we're two together actually connected to under god also in business with us praise you to god are we fighting toward our inheritance [Music] no sabbah when you start praying ordaining okay you realize that your prayer is going nowhere and sometimes something will easily give up is [Music] it is a key to christian life [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] he wants to reveal something to us praise be to god i mean he comes and shows us our promises of your faith and then he lived after he leaves that on us praise be to god come over here god is reminding joshua that you consider yourself about the death of moses have sponsored people behind him but remember first of all joshua had to know where he was standing yes praise be to i mean and here god comes and stamp on that jack now you made it out and he's telling you that there shall not any man be able to stand before thee to your narrative [Applause] [Applause] we have a promise of the coming of the and claim for this promise you know praise be to god come on because remember this is a sure deal god confirmed it become our face he said there shall no man be able to stand before us hallelujah hallelujah we have an inheritance to fight for torino and the prophet says something in this message of separation i must say you see that uh i used to oftentimes wonder what the what is the matter with the christian church again why they have got nothing to be scared about [Music] the first words nearly jesus said after the resurrection fear not yes do not fear don't yeah don't get scared don't yeah there ain't nothing going to happen nothing can happen nothing can bother a christian they worry to change [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] but you must amen he paid for each and because the bible [Music] [Music] without the holy spirit forever enough we have no chance before we get the holy spirit you have not even become a worshipper god has not even recognized your worship catholic caesar but remember the prophet tells us god is more willing to give us the whole city and even we who are yearning for it underway it is preached until believers are like that we get used of it and we don't take step two deep into that then that was praise to go and do research on this while in the way thing to be aware known as praise be to god come and ever see you know the problem with religion you hear something you hear it again and then you [Music] but it's not supposed to be like that with christians have a christie i'm a christian away to you praise you to god come and ever see we know our soul we know the life we are living oh whatever we're truly talking about we know where we're get staying bed to my neighbor praise be to god we are not pleasers of men the truly works on saban too but we are here to please god to you and oxendine sacramento know what god requires from us you know that coming to church is not enough you know him in the street which god wants you to take but the spirit of god is orderly he is disciplined you cannot enter into cheering holy ghost and then you misbehave [Music] suppose you receive a call just right now here i used to work with your father in earlier seventies but there is a land he purchased here it is a hundred by a hundred ladies [Music] i realized that some people are trying to they want to steal this language huh when you you receive the information from reliable source rather even if you don't have transport to go there oh it means to go there let me walk there just right now it's not fair [Music] and set home to treatment another opportunity that would be like an opportunity praise be to god amen how much more how old we that you see you're fighting for a spiritual inheritance words of wisdom enrique mariana enemy interpretation praise be to god those are your inheritance and the bible tells us to be able to come but we're going or will not be the bible says that we convey prophecies praise be to god amen the reason is uh just give some of them we are not singing this not because god is not in our mission but it's because we are not converting them amen the reason as to why we don't have the holy ghost and we are just settled that's why it is because it will be too late we are getting close to the coming of the lord every day the grace is moving toward the jews leaving the gentiles [Music] [Music] because it's in the spirit of drunkenness an apostle is telling us that we should not be drunk of wine never about to tell me no more you know we should be drunk of the spirit um a drunken person can bypass you without even seeing you why would she be to come back the physical things will lose meaning to you praise be to god amen because like the drunken money can bypass you unknowingly it is like how a blanket a man can pass you without seeing that is how you also bypass [Applause] we'll spend them on our knees the young people speaking for god's mercies praise be to god come on because the holy ghost speaks from the word of god amen amen we have got an inheritance to fight foreign [Music] yes [Music] [Music] is and when the you know yes jesus is the truth yes you came as jesus jesus of the holy spirit maybe some of the disciples he will teach you these things i mean amen i mean when they are filled with the holy spirit whereby i think when peter was preaching that part there there was a peter over here to come [Music] in the name of the lord [Applause] [Music] the biggest building in such and such a place is mine praise before god i mean that is how we ought to be turning a bed away to you christian we are not supposed to be statue golden look [Music] amen you must know this god as your friends you must have exponential experience with god god is not just this papers cartoon see [Music] this is god in written form oh
