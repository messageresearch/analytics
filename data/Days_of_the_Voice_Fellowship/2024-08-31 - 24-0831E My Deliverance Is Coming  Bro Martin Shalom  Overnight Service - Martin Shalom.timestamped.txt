[50:11] matter what is surrounding
[50:15] us no matter how hard things are but at
[50:19] least one thing we are sure of that our
[50:22] breakthrough or our deliverance is
[50:25] coming
[50:27] amen just as we know that
[50:30] uh God has his right time to do it and
[50:35] we just have to keep believing the word
[50:37] blessed be the name of the
[50:39] Lord and where we have read in Exodus
[50:42] chapter
[50:43] 14 if you begin from verses one the
[50:46] bible say that and and the Lord spake
[50:49] unto Moses saying speak to the children
[50:52] of Israel that they turn and ENC Hamp
[50:57] before Pharaoh
[51:00] between uh between migdol and sea over
[51:05] against
[51:07] balison before it shall before it shall
[51:11] ye encamp by the Sea for Pharaoh will
[51:16] say of the children of Israel they are
[51:20] in Tangled in the land the Wilderness
[51:23] hath shut them
[51:25] in and I will
[51:27] harden Pharaoh's heart that he shall
[51:31] follow after
[51:33] them God is working on both side now and
[51:38] I will be honored upon
[51:41] pharaoh and upon all his host that the
[51:46] Egyptians may know that I am the
[51:50] Lord amen and they did
[51:55] so God knew all the plans of
[51:58] pharaoh he knew all the plans of the
[52:01] Egyptians amen and the same God is
[52:05] giving Moses the direction is
[52:08] instructing Moses what to do the same
[52:11] God instructing Moses what to do is the
[52:14] same
[52:15] God speaking to Pharaoh hardening his
[52:20] heart amen that same God moved before
[52:25] them and told them what Pharaoh was
[52:27] going to do blessed be the name of the
[52:30] Lord and that is the same thing
[52:32] happening today God comes down and tells
[52:37] us what the devil is going to
[52:40] do amen he gives us tips how to maneuver
[52:45] the
[52:46] enemy he pushed the devil to come and
[52:49] then he comes and reveal to us and here
[52:53] where we have read it says that such
[52:55] that they may know that he is the Lord
[52:59] amen
[53:00] amen I will harden Pharaoh's
[53:05] heart and he shall follow after
[53:09] them God is speaking to
[53:12] Moses and I will be honored upon
[53:16] pharaoh and upon all his
[53:20] host that the Egyptian may
[53:23] know that I am the Lord
[53:27] and they did so they did according to
[53:30] what God told them amen their enemies
[53:33] pursuing the children of God and God
[53:37] wanted them to know that indeed he is
[53:41] God Amen
[53:59] amen so these people they were they were
[54:01] in their Journey to the promised
[54:04] land they had challenges because when
[54:08] God called them God never talked about
[54:11] their challenges he never talked about
[54:13] the Wilderness itself amen he never
[54:16] talked about the Red
[54:18] Sea blessed be the name of the Lord but
[54:21] he only told them about the promised
[54:24] land god want us to look at the promise
[54:27] no the hinderance before we we we obtain
[54:31] the promise blessed be the name of the
[54:34] Lord because
[54:36] God when God plans or
[54:40] purpose his plan will have to come to
[54:44] pass no matter what stands on God's way
[54:48] amen that will never fail because it is
[54:52] thus says the
[54:54] Lord but most time the devil comes and
[54:56] scares us the devil creates a situation
[54:59] around us wanting us to remove our eyes
[55:03] from the promise and looked at the
[55:06] St amen when Jesus was leaning when
[55:10] Jesus was in the
[55:12] boat the Bible says that Jesus fell
[55:18] asleep and then the storm
[55:22] Rose the disciples instead of
[55:25] remembering or looking at
[55:28] Jesus they moved their eyes from Jesus
[55:31] to the Sea and that's where the trouble
[55:34] was blessed be the name of the
[55:37] Lord Jesus was watching he wanted to see
[55:40] their
[55:41] action and many time God want to see
[55:45] what next what are you going to do
[55:49] next blessed be the name of the
[55:52] Lord because here the same God is Hing
[55:55] the heart of
[55:57] pharaoh and the more he hard in
[55:59] Pharaoh's heart the more he makes the
[56:02] life of Israel hard amen and at the same
[56:06] time he knows the end game blessed be
[56:10] the name of the
[56:23] Lord just perverted power
[56:27] but the source of power is God himself
[56:30] amen because our Prophet tells us that
[56:33] the devil cannot
[56:35] create but the devil can only
[56:39] pervert the devil can bring sickness and
[56:42] he cannot take away
[56:44] sickness
[56:47] amen
[56:54] so praise be to God
[56:57] [Applause]
[57:02] that's why we have many fake counterfeit
[57:15] Christians you find them in the street
[57:18] pained face
[57:19] Jezebel
[57:23] naked blessed be the name of the Lord
[57:26] but I'm here to tell you this evening
[57:28] that your breakthrough is
[57:30] coming no matter what is going on Amen
[57:33] no matter the challenges we are facing
[57:36] in our life in our homes blessed be the
[57:39] name of the Lord your breakthrough is
[57:42] coming as long as you're child of God as
[57:46] long as you are a
[57:48] Believer because the Bible tells us
[57:50] whosoever comes to God must believe that
[57:53] one is a must there is no debate on that
[57:56] you must believe that God
[57:59] is and let the devil not let the devil
[58:03] not lie you that you are here in vain
[58:06] you have come because you believe that
[58:08] you are coming to meet
[58:10] God and you very sure that God is here
[58:15] and you know that God has ears to hear
[58:18] your prayers and we are sure that God is
[58:22] going to answer every prayer we are
[58:24] making here tonight because he is amen
[58:29] God has ears God has eyes
[58:33] amen he's seeing you he's listening to
[58:36] you the Bible says that he is the high
[58:39] priest who is touched by the feeling of
[58:42] our
[58:43] infirmities the reason ask why Jesus put
[58:46] on flesh God put on flesh in that body
[58:49] called Jesus because he wanted to feel
[58:53] the way we are
[58:54] feeling there is no nothing today no
[58:57] feeling you can bring before God that is
[58:59] strange before
[59:01] him
[59:03] amen because the prophet tells us Jesus
[59:07] was tempted like any other
[59:10] man he was tempted with women he was
[59:14] tempted he
[59:16] was sick at a certain point amen the
[59:21] body was tempted he was in this body and
[59:25] God was trying this
[59:27] body and Jesus went through it when he
[59:31] was on the cross when he said that all
[59:33] is finished
[59:35] amen he meant everything was
[59:47] finished brother I'm here to tell that
[59:51] it is
[59:53] finished Calvary settled it
[59:58] all is up to you to
[1:00:01] believe to keep
[1:00:03] confessing trusting in God that mountain
[1:00:07] will
[1:00:08] move blessed be the name of the
[1:00:12] Lord you see the natural is supposed to
[1:00:14] teach us
[1:00:17] spiritual you see even when you are
[1:00:19] digging maybe like a a
[1:00:23] hall or talk of people who who always uh
[1:00:27] people who dig like uh
[1:00:31] ponds when you start it is very easy
[1:00:34] it's very simple but as you go
[1:00:38] deeper the deeper you go the harder it
[1:00:44] becomes there is the point where you
[1:00:47] reach where you will Hammer maybe with
[1:00:50] big
[1:00:53] ax and it's like you you're not prog
[1:00:56] progressing but you find those guys they
[1:00:59] will keep on
[1:01:01] digging blessed be the name of the
[1:01:04] Lord the way God does his things it is
[1:01:08] gradually God does not
[1:01:11] go or violate the law of
[1:01:15] nature blessed be the name of the
[1:01:17] Lord amen a woman cannot get pregnant
[1:01:21] today and gives birth
[1:01:24] tomorrow it m must follow or go through
[1:01:27] a
[1:01:31] process and every month has something to
[1:01:35] add on that
[1:01:37] baby blessed be the name of the Lord if
[1:01:40] you look at even the the life cycle of
[1:01:43] the
[1:01:44] toip the frog from the eggs then from
[1:01:47] there it moves another until it becomes
[1:01:51] the final frog there's even a point when
[1:01:54] that thing will have a tail
[1:01:56] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:02:00] amen but those are stages and
[1:02:05] Perfection the same apply to us
[1:02:08] Christians we must be tried
[1:02:12] Amen in that trial sometime it is fire
[1:02:16] trial sometime it means losing our loved
[1:02:20] ones amen going through artion going
[1:02:24] without food
[1:02:26] going without
[1:02:28] job blessed be the name of the
[1:02:36] Lord you find when God works it out for
[1:02:40] our good praise be to God so I'm here to
[1:02:44] tell you tonight my brethren that our
[1:02:46] deliverance is
[1:02:48] coming the Egyptian were planning God
[1:02:52] was working God was in this thing he was
[1:02:56] ing Pharaoh's heart he was giving this
[1:02:58] how to escape and he was revealing to
[1:03:00] them how they are going to overcome
[1:03:04] pharaoh and a certain point he told them
[1:03:06] that the Egyptian you are seeing
[1:03:09] today you shall see them no
[1:03:15] more remember God had made Moses god
[1:03:20] Moses was a God and Aaron was a prophet
[1:03:24] so when Moses stood and spoke to them
[1:03:27] and told them when God told Moses that
[1:03:30] the Egyptian you are seeing today you'll
[1:03:33] see them normal maybe if a make a
[1:03:37] Believer maybe make a believers they
[1:03:40] laughed say ah sometime people can go
[1:03:44] crazy how how how because remember the
[1:03:47] prophet tells us that
[1:03:49] Egyptian in those days it was the
[1:03:53] superpower and these are just words
[1:03:57] the Egyptian you seeing today you will
[1:03:59] see them no more
[1:04:02] how it's like youa telling America that
[1:04:05] the America you're seeing today we shall
[1:04:07] crush it into pieces you even
[1:04:23] laugh the weapon God God has used to
[1:04:26] equip the church is the
[1:04:29] final amen that's why a True Believer
[1:04:32] will not run to Prophet so and so there
[1:04:35] is Prophet so and so when the other one
[1:04:38] prays even you see
[1:04:40] lightning why because we know that what
[1:04:43] we have is the
[1:04:45] final and God has got his own right time
[1:04:49] to perform it amen and if you can only
[1:04:53] believe if you can raise your faith you
[1:04:56] can provoke God to perform it now in
[1:04:58] your life amen each time God send his
[1:05:02] word god want to act upon his word but
[1:05:05] always it's up to as a Believer either
[1:05:08] to grasp it and believe it or to Poston
[1:05:11] it in the
[1:05:12] future blessed be the name of the
[1:05:15] Lord much as last on Wednesday we
[1:05:18] talking about the man at the pool of
[1:05:20] beida but I also believe that if that
[1:05:23] man had believed God
[1:05:30] because in the courts of
[1:05:33] law if the if the victim accept that is
[1:05:47] guilty but if you don't you know that
[1:05:50] you a criminal you committed offense and
[1:05:53] you don't admit no
[1:06:06] I believe the same thing work even this
[1:06:10] side brother sister we can provoke God
[1:06:14] to perform spanio in our
[1:06:16] midst amen many times because we don't
[1:06:20] read the word but each time you read the
[1:06:23] Bible each time you listen to the
[1:06:25] message message it provokes your faith
[1:06:28] you hear how God moves in the service
[1:06:31] and you ask yourself where is
[1:06:34] this
[1:06:37] amen where is the god of the message who
[1:06:40] creates the missing
[1:06:46] limbs for me I have my problem leave my
[1:06:49] alone I have my
[1:06:52] sickness brother sister it's not your
[1:06:54] sickness
[1:06:56] it is the devil's
[1:07:02] sickness you are not the devil's
[1:07:05] accountant you are the one keeping his
[1:07:07] sickness keeping his trouble keeping his
[1:07:12] sorrow no sir we are children of God we
[1:07:16] are different people amen we have
[1:07:18] another spirit and that is the spirit of
[1:07:21] God we come from the kingdom amen that
[1:07:25] cannot be shaken the kingdom that cannot
[1:07:28] be
[1:07:29] moved that's where we belong that's
[1:07:33] where we came from we are the children
[1:07:36] of God when we speak God
[1:07:41] listened when we cry he hears our cry
[1:07:45] when we pray answers our prayer and each
[1:07:48] one of us here we have answered
[1:07:52] prayers amen and you sit there are
[1:07:56] witness that God answers
[1:07:59] prayer many time the devil make us to
[1:08:01] forget these things and think you are
[1:08:04] not just coming to church in vain the
[1:08:06] reason as you are coming until today it
[1:08:09] is because at a certain point God
[1:08:11] answered your prayers and you know that
[1:08:14] this thing
[1:08:16] works blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:08:26] why don't you go if they if they don't
[1:08:29] work you come because they
[1:08:35] work that's why we should not forget our
[1:08:41] testimonies David used the past
[1:08:44] testimony to overcome the
[1:08:47] giant praise be to
[1:08:50] God but most time God helpes you to go
[1:08:54] through some something then you reach a
[1:08:57] then you forget and start
[1:09:00] murmuring the bible say that God made
[1:09:03] them to go through the Wilderness
[1:09:05] because he wanted to know what was in
[1:09:07] their
[1:09:11] heart when God called them out of Egypt
[1:09:14] he called them they were mixed
[1:09:18] multitude and even Moses did not have
[1:09:21] the seve he not have the way of sing
[1:09:25] this Mak
[1:09:27] multitude blessed be the name of the

[1:34:20] one is for you he sh you to believe that
[1:34:22] the Holy Ghost belongs belongs to you
[1:34:24] and you claim for
[1:34:26] it it's not going to come from glory and
[1:34:29] park with the Holy
[1:34:34] Ghost God does not work that
[1:34:37] way
[1:34:42] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:34:46] Lord you must claim it yourself but that
[1:34:49] is the great thing to expect something
[1:34:52] usually
[1:34:55] what you expect is what you get you can
[1:34:58] never go
[1:35:00] above your
[1:35:02] confession God's purpose cannot be
[1:35:05] defeated there is nothing that can
[1:35:08] defeat the purpose of
[1:35:10] God that's why when they saw that the
[1:35:13] enemies were coming God encouraged them
[1:35:16] and told them that the Egyptian you are
[1:35:19] seeing today you will not see them again
[1:35:22] why because God had purpose in their
[1:35:24] life and God knew that all the gods of
[1:35:28] Egypt all the waves of Egypt all the
[1:35:31] Demons of Egypt all the host of Egypt
[1:35:33] could not defeat that
[1:35:36] purpose what God is valuing in your life
[1:35:40] is his purpose in
[1:35:44] you not the way you look but for
[1:35:52] me the J
[1:35:55] ma no there is a purpose in that
[1:36:01] Tabernacle and the owner of that purpose
[1:36:03] will take care of that Tabernacle until
[1:36:06] that purpose is manifested amen when God
[1:36:10] put a seed in you that seed cannot fail
[1:36:14] that seed cannot be premature amen that
[1:36:17] seed will have to
[1:36:19] germinate that's why when Jonah was in
[1:36:21] the bottom of the sea the seed of God In
[1:36:24] Jonah had to come out and sprang in
[1:36:30] na praise be to God that is what God is
[1:36:34] following in our
[1:36:37] lives when you are sure of your calling
[1:36:39] and election the rest you leave it to
[1:36:43] God you know he said he chose us we
[1:36:47] never chose God
[1:37:05] for
[1:37:08] [Applause]
[1:37:37] and you think
[1:37:44] that the parents B to take care of their
[1:37:47] children our God is more than able more
[1:37:51] than dound to take care of his church to
[1:37:53] take care of his minister to take care
[1:37:55] of his
[1:38:00] children there are many things that
[1:38:02] would have happened upon your life but
[1:38:04] God has been there and you know these
[1:38:09] things there isn't enough power in hell
[1:38:12] in the message what does it take to make
[1:38:15] a Christian Life there isn't enough
[1:38:18] power in all hell that can ever defeat
[1:38:22] the purpose of
[1:38:26] God even R could not defeat the purpose
[1:38:29] of
[1:38:31] God the Bible says when they reached
[1:38:34] there the pillar of fire moved behind
[1:38:38] them amen and God looked at them and
[1:38:44] that was the end of
[1:38:47] them to them who believe all things are
[1:38:52] possible
[1:38:54] God never told us to figure these things
[1:38:56] out no
[1:39:03] sir will I make it
[1:39:09] really sister can you also be sincere
[1:39:13] and tell us how many times have you been
[1:39:15] walking carefully

[1:39:40] to you are looking at where you are
[1:39:44] going your feet already God direct this
[1:39:47] feet physically
[1:39:53] how about
[1:39:55] spiritually that's why the Bible said
[1:39:57] the word of the Lord is the
[1:39:59] lamp to our
[1:40:03] feet blessed be the name of the Lord I
[1:40:06] want us to read
[1:40:08] Psalms chapter
[1:40:12] 66 vers
[1:40:19] 12 Psalm 6612
[1:40:40] he said thou H has caused men to ride
[1:40:42] over our heads we went through fire and
[1:40:46] through water but thou broughtest us out
[1:40:52] into a wethy
[1:40:55] Place praise be to God are you going
[1:40:58] through fire are you going through
[1:41:01] waterers God will bring you out to a
[1:41:05] worth the
[1:41:07] place don't look at your Waters some
[1:41:10] through the waters some through the fire
[1:41:13] amen some goes through the mountain
[1:41:15] others goes through the dark Valley but
[1:41:18] all through the
[1:41:20] blood this was David's testimony
[1:41:24] he brought them through the waters he
[1:41:26] brought them through the
[1:41:30] fire but
[1:41:32] finally the Lord brought them to a
[1:41:35] wealthy
[1:41:37] Place amen that's why I'm here to tell
[1:41:40] you church that your deliverance is
[1:41:43] coming your deliverance is here
[1:41:51] amen God has fought many many of our
[1:41:56] battles he has shown us
[1:42:01] kindness we have annoyed him many times
[1:42:05] sometime you
[1:42:06] Rebel with a full
[1:42:09] knowledge and you disobey
[1:42:12] God but still God H forgive you go back
[1:42:15] and you cry then God forgives
[1:42:17] you it's because of that
[1:42:20] purpose blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:42:24] amen no matter what we are
[1:42:28] facing that is the truth not just excit
[1:42:31] but that is the
[1:42:38] truth when all Heaven turn
[1:42:41] lose all hell turn lose too but when all
[1:42:45] hell turn lose Heaven turn lose
[1:42:50] too when Paul was in prison
[1:42:55] the devil thought that was the end of
[1:42:57] Paul and maybe physical part of Paul
[1:43:01] thought that was his
[1:43:03] End Amen but God had a mega plan upon
[1:43:08] his life Paul was there just waiting on
[1:43:12] God and the Holy Ghost inspired them to
[1:43:14] sing praise amen and when they were
[1:43:18] doing that in shame the Deliverance was
[1:43:21] coming
[1:43:24] praise be to God many time when we begin
[1:43:28] to pray you feel like prayer is not
[1:43:31] moving you feel like I mean it's not
[1:43:34] even going over your head but one thing
[1:43:37] I can tell you tonight just keep praying
[1:43:40] something is
[1:43:42] happening
[1:43:43] [Applause]
[1:43:45] amen when you when you try to make a
[1:43:48] hole on this pillar you cannot hit it
[1:43:51] once and then the Chisel goes through
[1:43:55] it sometime when we are doing our
[1:43:58] pluming
[1:44:00] work there is where you have to Chisel a
[1:44:03] colons or a
[1:44:06] tach but chiseling a space where 1 in
[1:44:10] pipe or half inch can go
[1:44:15] through brother most people during
[1:44:18] internship that's where they that's when
[1:44:19] they quit I say may let me try Saloon
[1:44:29] amen and when you have a bad
[1:44:32] instructor he will tell you he will
[1:44:34] bring maybe 4 in pipe and tell you I
[1:44:38] want this pipe disappear in the
[1:44:41] wall and brother you will maybe you'll
[1:44:43] choose a qu inch maybe like a half meter
[1:44:47] or quarter meter you'll go home with all
[1:44:51] your hands paining but in the the back
[1:44:53] of your mind you already know that even
[1:44:54] tomorrow the thing is still waiting for
[1:44:57] you you come back again for the second
[1:45:00] day the third day and when you're
[1:45:04] looking at where you are going where you
[1:45:06] you to go cross through Bal
[1:45:10] Road praise be to
[1:45:13] God look at the National Water Guys you
[1:45:17] find them digging the trench a small one
[1:45:20] but they have to go through pvas they
[1:45:21] have to go through tach they have to go
[1:45:24] under the roof sorry the uh The
[1:45:28] Roots sometime Things become so hard and
[1:45:32] they have to come and pour the
[1:45:34] water and wait for it at least to be
[1:45:37] soften a little bit then they come back
[1:45:40] tomorrow blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:45:43] that is the same procedia God is using
[1:45:46] amen God comes with the water of the
[1:45:49] word and pours it in your strong heart
[1:45:53] and by and by it starts softening
[1:46:00] amen that's why the bible say that the
[1:46:02] word of God is like a big hmer that
[1:46:08] breaks
[1:46:10] amen so what I'm trying to say keep on
[1:46:14] chiseling amen when you come to church
[1:46:17] today and you feel you're out of church
[1:46:19] come again tomorrow Jes you are part
[1:46:22] again
[1:46:23] when you feel like today yeah things are
[1:46:25] okay come back another day when you come
[1:46:28] that feel like it's even worse come back
[1:46:30] another day amen by the time you realize
[1:46:33] brother sister you will hit the last
[1:46:36] Hammer amen and the Jes will go through
[1:46:39] the wall and that is the work of the
[1:46:43] Gospel it is preached from January to
[1:46:46] January but one thing I'm sure of you
[1:46:50] are not remaining the same something's
[1:46:53] happening in your life you may not even
[1:46:56] realize it but the devil knows
[1:47:01] it because this word cannot turn the
[1:47:04] same it
[1:47:06] cannot whether you believe it or not
[1:47:10] when you believe it gives you life when
[1:47:11] you reject still the word will judge you
[1:47:14] so it cannot go back the
[1:47:16] same praise be to God but because that
[1:47:19] hope is there that one of these days I
[1:47:22] will fix my pipe on this
[1:47:26] wall but Believers we like too much
[1:47:30] technology because nowadays there are
[1:47:32] wall breakers you just come and then it
[1:47:35] goes
[1:47:38] through but God has no wall breakers
[1:47:41] there's no shortcut with God you have to
[1:47:44] follow the old way that's why he says in
[1:47:47] Jeremiah go back and stand at the
[1:47:50] junction amen ask for that all the path
[1:47:54] and walk
[1:47:57] therein
[1:47:58] amen go back to the old
[1:48:02] path there is no shortcut with
[1:48:06] God when Moses ran out of
[1:48:09] Egypt Moses God never told Moses that
[1:48:13] now since that time you came running you
[1:48:15] are go back using migs you're just going
[1:48:18] to bombard every city no sir when he met
[1:48:22] God
[1:48:23] God told him you're going back the same
[1:48:25] way you came the same way you're going
[1:48:27] back but this time
[1:48:29] around you are a God now Aaron is your
[1:48:33] Prophet blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:48:36] so this time round Moses still had to go
[1:48:39] back and face the same same enemy he ran
[1:48:43] from but this time round something had
[1:48:47] happened the same thing that happened to
[1:48:50] Jacob is meeting the same Esau the same
[1:48:53] brother in the same family but something
[1:48:56] had happened around him or in his
[1:49:00] life blessed be the name of the
[1:49:03] Lord and every Christian must have that
[1:49:09] experience do not be
[1:49:12] deceived if you don't get that
[1:49:15] experience one of these days you're
[1:49:17] going to be drifted
[1:49:20] away Sisters You better get that
[1:49:24] experience because if not don't be
[1:49:26] surprised when you find yourself you are
[1:49:28] the ninth wife to a certain H in a
[1:49:31] certain or certain IM in a certain
[1:49:34] MOS what will keep you what will keep
[1:49:37] that brother from from not
[1:49:40] becoming
[1:49:42] apologist it is that
[1:49:46] experience and that experience is good
[1:49:50] here and that is the Deliverance I'm
[1:49:52] talking talking about blessed be the
[1:49:55] name of the
[1:49:56] Lord the Holy Ghost comes first then
[1:49:59] other things happen don't remain when
[1:50:02] you are just
[1:50:06] Justified don't only stop with
[1:50:10] sanctification you know when you're
[1:50:12] Sanctified I think that is the most
[1:50:14] dangerous
[1:50:16] stage
[1:50:21] because remember the Holy Ghost has not
[1:50:23] sat in that
[1:50:25] heart you are just clean you don't lie
[1:50:29] you don't cheat you don't fornicate you
[1:50:32] are just there but remember when unclean
[1:50:35] Spirit goes out of that house it moves
[1:50:38] in the
[1:50:39] dry
[1:50:44] and brother James
[1:51:04] so he goes and call more strong demons
[1:51:07] that's what the Bible says and say the
[1:51:10] condition of that person will be
[1:51:13] worse so don't only stop there be sure
[1:51:18] somebody is SE there be sure the holy
[1:51:20] spirit is in that heart
[1:51:26] be sure ask God am I filled with the
[1:51:29] Holy
[1:51:30] Spirit keep seeking amen even those who
[1:51:35] think they have even those who have keep
[1:51:38] believing God to be revealed again and
[1:51:40] again and
[1:51:42] again blessed be the name of the
[1:51:46] Lord amen
[1:51:56] we just have to take God's word shall we
[1:51:58] stand on our feet we just have to take
[1:52:00] God's
[1:52:02] word for eat and start
