[1:00:51] which

[1:01:46] and based on that little information
[1:01:51] i have come to visit that church

[1:02:10] i will testify julia
[1:02:13] that pastor talema
[1:02:17] has almost impacted my life and has
[1:02:21] converted into another dimension
[1:02:30] you see this message has the power
[1:03:12] what you need to know about ethiopia
[1:03:22] many preachers many ministers from the
[1:03:24] message
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] have been tried
[1:04:10] uganda
[1:05:06] what i'm preaching
[1:05:18] it will die together with these others
[1:05:23] it doesn't mean that teaching uh is not
[1:05:27] i didn't say that teaching is bad
[1:05:31] we have different professions
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:45] yes we have to do our best
[1:06:04] is another dimension
[1:06:08] so i am thankful for for good neighbors
[1:06:12] has given me this chance
[1:06:15] and to come across from
[1:06:21] myself here in my beloved pastor
[1:06:24] talema's
[1:06:25] fellowship
[1:06:30] it is a big deal for me
[1:06:34] i know this place it doesn't uh
[1:06:38] you are limited in this place
[1:06:42] today i prophesy
[1:06:44] you shall
[1:06:49] amen we receive it hallelujah amen
[1:06:52] i proclaim
[1:06:55] because every word that comes out from
[1:06:58] the message believers
[1:07:11] that is just what happened on our
[1:07:13] prophet's life
[1:07:17] ministry
[1:07:20] he has been able to create by his mouth
[1:07:26] on the web out yeah you cannot get into
[1:07:30] and it comes through
[1:07:32] hallelujah amen
[1:07:34] may god give you that grace
[1:07:38] give you that faith
[1:08:07] [Music]
[1:08:20] you found that the prophet
[1:08:31] so when we start about defining from
[1:08:34] defining what the token means
[1:08:50] a sign of a paid price
[1:08:56] for example
[1:08:58] if you want to go uh by airplane
[1:09:05] they because they they cost you
[1:09:09] the same amount of money
[1:09:13] so when you give them that amount of
[1:09:16] money
[1:09:18] they will give you the same amount of uh
[1:09:21] money
[1:09:22] uh tickets
[1:09:24] tickets
[1:09:26] or an accounting uh we say it is receipt
[1:09:32] italy
[1:09:45] if you don't go with that invoice or
[1:09:47] receipt or ticket to the airplane
[1:09:53] they will not serve you
[1:09:56] even if you paid
[1:09:59] if you don't have that ticket
[1:10:26] so when we see from exodus chapter
[1:10:35] as we have read the scripture if you
[1:10:37] want to show me
[1:10:39] in this exodus
[1:10:46] the time was the beginnings of
[1:10:49] exodus which means god bringing israel
[1:10:52] all out of egypt
[1:11:23] but for uh israelis or for the children
[1:11:26] of abraham
[1:11:28] for them to reach on that promised land
[1:11:36] forest zenith to come out from their
[1:11:38] darkness
[1:11:52] they have been in bondage
[1:11:55] they have lost their hopes for many
[1:11:57] years
[1:12:00] as if
[1:12:01] someone like that who doesn't have good
[1:12:05] [Music]
[1:12:07] they have lost everything
[1:12:12] the yoke on their shoulder was too much
[1:12:18] but one day
[1:12:21] when god
[1:12:23] decides to uh bring them out from that
[1:12:26] bondage
[1:12:31] he sent them a prophet
[1:12:35] we know the prophet moses
[1:12:39] through prophet moses
[1:12:42] god has arranged and able to bring them
[1:12:45] out
[1:12:51] but while there they were in that
[1:12:54] situations of bondage
[1:12:58] you see
[1:13:00] what just happened to us
[1:13:03] goes to these two nations
[1:13:07] the nations of israel and the nations of
[1:13:10] egypt
[1:13:13] they were under the same authority
[1:13:26] you know the place where the silent has
[1:13:28] been gathered together
[1:13:33] yes
[1:13:34] so god wants us to execute judgment on
[1:13:38] the peoples of egypt
[1:13:43] and the gods of egypt
[1:13:47] even all the beasts of egypt
[1:13:51] he decided to execute judgment
[1:13:56] but before that judgment
[1:14:11] so he just instructed them
[1:14:15] to
[1:14:16] uh to prepare a lamb
[1:14:20] to kill that lamb
[1:14:23] and to put or to apply the bloods of
[1:14:26] that lamp on the door
[1:14:32] hallelujah
[1:14:33] that was the requirement
[1:14:38] because when the
[1:14:40] days ended or the angels of days comes
[1:14:45] to smite every firstborn
[1:14:51] if that end this angel
[1:14:56] does not see or look that blood
[1:15:00] he will just kill the first bird of even
[1:15:03] the animals even the pupils
[1:15:22] that was the token for them
[1:15:27] what is the token for us today
[1:15:31] we are under the bondage of this world
[1:15:47] but before god executes his judgment on
[1:15:50] this world
[1:16:02] this message
[1:16:04] [Music]
[1:16:06] this message is a token for each and
[1:16:08] every one of us
[1:16:12] it is just like a blood that we need to
[1:16:14] apply on each and every one of us
[1:16:24] and the blood shall do you for a token
[1:16:29] upon the houses where you are and when i
[1:16:32] see the blood i will pass over you.
[1:16:37] [Music]
[1:16:43] when i see the blood
[1:16:45] i will pass over your
[1:16:58] but those people who doesn't have this
[1:17:00] message
[1:17:13] if they don't have that revelation
[1:17:26] of the judgment
[1:17:27] shall not
[1:17:42] you
[1:17:48] hallelujah amen the bride of jesus
[1:17:51] christ
[1:17:52] christian is the place where jesus
[1:17:54] christ is living
[1:18:10] you
[1:18:24] hallelujah amen there are many churches
[1:18:28] there are many number of denominations
[1:18:33] if they don't apply in their life this
[1:18:35] message
[1:18:52] these people reject this message of this
[1:18:54] blood
[1:18:58] hallelujah amen
[1:19:00] they have the bible bible
[1:19:03] and they know that the bible allows
[1:19:06] baptism
[1:19:09] but the way they baptize people
[1:19:19] is another man made a
[1:19:24] that's why this message has come to
[1:19:26] restore us back to the original truth
[1:19:32] knowing what the knowing that uh the
[1:19:35] bible or the scripture
[1:19:37] allow us to baptize
[1:19:44] it doesn't help us
[1:19:59] these are the most important issues
[1:20:23] when the bible
[1:20:24] uh told us to baptize
[1:20:27] those who are able to repent
[1:21:36] so this is why we need
[1:21:38] to have the token
[1:22:06] [Music]
[1:22:09] so the same way this message is talking
[1:22:12] will help us
[1:22:16] not to be judged
[1:22:19] not to be uh not to be
[1:22:21] one of the
[1:22:22] one of uh
[1:22:24] those people or those denominations that
[1:22:27] this plague
[1:22:28] will come and destroy them today
[1:22:32] [Music]
[1:22:36] god is going
[1:22:50] which can be tomorrow
[1:23:18] there is
[1:24:05] hallelujah amen
[1:24:08] so the token was the thing that made the
[1:24:11] difference between egypt and israel
[1:24:23] [Applause]
[1:24:27] all god created
[1:25:09] and those who call themselves
[1:25:11] church
[1:25:14] or some kind of denomination
[1:25:18] all kinds of organizations
[1:25:22] hallelujah
[1:25:24] that bride oh my god
[1:25:26] has been calling out yay
[1:25:29] okay
[1:25:30] from days to life
[1:25:34] not only from uganda uganda
[1:25:37] that pride has come even from ethiopia
[1:25:39] today
[1:25:42] that pride has come from across america
[1:25:50] she is everywhere
[1:26:02] that is what makes it different
[1:26:04] from other churches or denominations
[1:26:21] not being controlled by any head office
[1:26:27] jesus christ
[1:26:31] hallelujah
[1:26:32] he is our leader
[1:26:39] jesus christ is the one who makes us a
[1:26:42] bride of
[1:26:43] himself yes
[1:26:48] hallelujah amen let me tell you the
[1:26:50] truth today
[1:26:52] even you no way you didn't even choose
[1:26:55] or uh yourself to be a bride of jesus
[1:26:57] christ
[1:27:01] it is
[1:27:16] hallelujah amen
[1:27:18] you have been someone who received jesus
[1:27:21] christ as personal savior
[1:27:24] going from one church to another
[1:27:44] time
[1:27:46] has come for you to recognize who you
[1:27:48] are
[1:27:51] you have now come to the revelation that
[1:27:54] who you are
[1:28:06] hallelujah
[1:28:08] amen
[1:28:09] this message
[1:28:12] is our
[1:28:28] that makes us
[1:28:30] the bride of jesus christ
[1:28:34] who is that bride
[1:28:37] back to the original
[1:28:54] this message
[1:29:49] there is several of them
[1:30:03] that if you judge it by the baptist
[1:30:05] church
[1:30:17] then the rest of them is
[1:30:59] and jesus is
[1:31:04] so then it comes back to the bible again
[1:31:11] he will judge the word by the bible
[1:31:26] jesus christ
[1:31:40] the penalty of doing it
[1:31:42] yes adding order taken from it's the
[1:31:45] penalty of it
[1:31:52] your name out of the book of life
[1:31:56] just stay
[1:32:37] who gave us this message
[1:32:41] even if god uses only man
[1:32:46] another man
[1:32:50] but the caller
[1:33:03] [Applause]
[1:33:04] [Music]
[1:33:07] we don't care if that prophet comes from
[1:33:09] ethiopia
[1:33:12] we don't care whether that prophet comes
[1:33:15] from china
[1:33:16] china
[1:33:17] we don't care that prophet comes uh from
[1:33:34] maybe i needed to be far hope but what
[1:33:37] we care about
[1:33:39] is what is that message
[1:33:44] what is it all about
[1:33:47] is it all about the bible
[1:34:02] he is not going to uh god is not going
[1:34:05] to judge the whole earth by
[1:34:10] this
[1:34:11] 1200 messages or sermons
[1:34:14] by william romero catholic
[1:34:30] so god is going to judge the whole
[1:34:33] artist and the word by the bible
[1:34:39] the messenger told us to baptize in the
[1:34:41] name of our lord jesus christ
[1:35:10] by calling upon the name of our lord
[1:35:12] jesus
[1:35:15] no one has been baptized by literally
[1:35:19] calling the father in the holy ghost
[1:35:25] father is just a tithe
[1:35:54] if you want to give me one billion check
[1:35:58] though
[1:36:01] unless you write my name
[1:36:08] instead of writing my name on that check
[1:36:13] if you called
[1:36:15] or if you write my
[1:36:18] my father name
[1:36:22] and said like uh if you write my father
[1:36:26] name is niku
[1:36:29] so if you write on that check by saying
[1:36:32] this no gamba
[1:36:34] for the son of negocia
[1:37:06] [Applause]
[1:37:33] angel gabriel has uh has told for uh
[1:37:36] mary maria
[1:37:38] maria he shall be called
[1:37:40] jesus
[1:37:42] hallelujah amen god himself manifested
[1:37:45] in flesh
[1:38:00] his name
[1:38:18] [Applause]
[1:38:40] whatever the prophet had said in
[1:38:48] [Music]
[1:38:54] god is going to judge the world by the
[1:39:10] anyone
[1:39:25] not all about the prophets
[1:39:32] hallelujah amen it's all about the
[1:39:34] message that man has bring for us
[1:39:54] [Applause]
[1:40:29] [Applause]
[1:41:12] of the first links of his flock
[1:41:17] and of the fat thereof
[1:41:19] and the lord had respect unto a bear
[1:41:23] and to his offering
[1:41:25] but until cain
[1:41:27] and to his offering he had not respect
[1:41:31] and cain was very rose and his
[1:41:34] countenance failed
[1:41:37] hallelujah
[1:41:44] say
[1:41:59] [Music]
[1:42:00] you see in this scenario
[1:42:04] what just happened was that
[1:42:07] there were two brothers
[1:42:10] called abba and kane
[1:42:12] [Music]
[1:42:24] the seed that comes out from
[1:42:26] adam and single about adam which is abel
[1:42:32] he office spirit is from god himself
[1:42:37] so he knows
[1:42:40] how to please his god and get your son
[1:42:43] away because when you are a seed of god
[1:42:49] you don't need to be told how to please
[1:42:51] god
[1:43:08] in this scenario
[1:43:11] abel and kane have been in accounting
[1:43:14] they are about to give offerings
[1:43:22] god himself
[1:43:24] but what makes the difference between
[1:43:27] their offering
[1:43:31] is the revelation
[1:43:35] you see
[1:43:39] he brings us
[1:43:40] as an offering
[1:43:42] a bloody uh a shedding blood from a lamp
[1:43:46] [Music]
[1:44:07] he brings all the best fruits that can
[1:44:09] be found in eden
[1:44:14] he was about the beauties
[1:44:18] all those who seems
[1:44:21] like beautiful
[1:44:24] something that seems like attractive
[1:44:29] so
[1:44:30] he thought he would be accepted by the
[1:44:32] lord
[1:44:44] he was pleased by the offerings of ebay
[1:44:50] when we see abel
[1:44:53] i'm sure he was you know
[1:44:55] there is so much blood around him
[1:45:15] that thing that seems like i'm pleasant
[1:45:18] for in the eyes of the mask
[1:45:24] is going to accept
[1:45:28] it by the
[1:45:36] [Music]
[1:45:56] that happened
[1:45:59] without shedding the blood
[1:46:01] [Music]
[1:46:04] of sin
[1:46:08] because
[1:46:10] seen by
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:38] it that how a blood has a relationship
[1:46:41] with the first scene
[1:46:46] that's why god has already ordained
[1:46:49] for a man to be saved
[1:47:00] [Music]
[1:47:40] god ordained or god has been instructed
[1:47:43] specifically for the children of israel
[1:47:47] for them to be saved they need to apply
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:03] that's why god has obligated to
[1:48:06] put himself a flesh
[1:48:11] he could have come as an angel
[1:48:15] yes he has the potential
[1:48:28] [Music]
[1:48:30] uh
[1:48:44] saying
[1:48:46] you see
[1:48:48] the ultimate price
[1:48:50] that has been paid for the elected ones
[1:48:56] is not just a million dollars
[1:49:10] amen amen
[1:49:13] that is also the only
[1:49:15] paid price for us to be saved
[1:49:22] we are so happy
[1:49:25] to have this message
[1:49:42] we shall not have any uh coffee or uh
[1:49:46] any uh
