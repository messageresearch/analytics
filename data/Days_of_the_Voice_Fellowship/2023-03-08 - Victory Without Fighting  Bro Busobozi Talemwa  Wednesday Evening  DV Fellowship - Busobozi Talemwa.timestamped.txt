[6:57] fire
[6:59] [Music]

[7:49] [Music]
[7:52] the song is tonight
[7:54] I'm gonna talk about battles
[7:59] so we are soldiers
[8:03] when soldiers are going to attack they
[8:06] begin by singing warming up
[8:08] and then they go and touch the eyes
[8:31] Oh What a Mighty God
[8:33] [Music]
[8:40] [Music]
[8:51] [Music]
[9:18] [Music]
[9:20] Hallelujah
[9:38] [Music]
[9:50] foreign
[9:55] [Music]
[10:10] [Music]
[10:36] [Music]
[10:38] I'm speaking to you today on Victory
[10:41] without fighting
[10:46] Victory without fighting
[10:49] [Music]
[10:51] now Victory cannot come without fighting
[10:57] constances
[10:59] many people desire to have Victory but
[11:01] they don't like to fight
[11:05] many people fight but lose their battles
[11:10] and a True Believer is never meant to be
[11:12] on the losing site
[11:20] victory in all his battles
[11:26] you know if you have a True Believer in
[11:29] every battle you fight you will win that
[11:31] kills
[11:34] if you're a True Believer there is no
[11:36] battle that will ever win you but I'm
[11:39] okay
[11:41] you can never be on the losing side
[11:45] you will always be on The Winning Side
[11:49] just you know we have to follow the
[11:51] script Twitter I got to go very rich
[11:54] we have to follow what has been written
[11:57] about us and for us to follow
[12:01] we shouldn't write our own word or our
[12:04] own scripture to follow
[12:08] but if we follow what has been written
[12:11] if we follow what has been given to us
[12:16] then we are rest assured
[12:18] we shall all
[13:17] good day
[13:20] foreign
[13:30] you know I've been seeing a lot I'm not
[13:33] a football fan myself
[13:35] and that makes the world look like what
[13:38] and you're a man yes
[13:41] [Music]
[13:47] and so I've been seeing things all over
[13:50] social media
[13:53] and you see uh the the the the the the
[13:55] the supporters of Liverpool
[13:59] I've been cheering
[14:02] they're telling all the other losers
[14:24] and
[15:24] that and that's what I wanted us to talk
[15:26] about tonight
[15:27] and what is so amazing that I want to
[15:29] talk about it
[15:33] you don't even need to fight
[15:37] get your Victory
[15:39] the believer will always get Victory
[15:43] without fighting one that is a confusing
[15:48] thing
[15:50] it is uh like the prophet would say a
[15:52] paradox
[15:54] you see but that's the truth let us look
[15:58] at the Battle of Judah that we have read
[16:00] about in The Book of uh Second
[16:01] Chronicles that we read
[16:06] to those of you who Miss second
[16:08] chronicles 20 from verse 1 to 26.
[16:17] here in in there were three powerful
[16:21] United Kingdoms again
[16:24] and they were all coming against one
[16:27] little kingdom called Judas
[16:31] and this little kingdom was being led by
[16:34] a king called jehoshaphas
[16:43] he was a Man Who Loved God
[16:46] there was a Man Who Loved prayer
[16:50] he was a man who revered God above all
[16:53] others
[16:57] and so you know they are these three
[16:59] kingdoms
[17:01] that United themselves
[17:04] against the kingdom of Judah
[17:07] and they came they agreed
[17:11] to come and fight and kill all the
[17:15] inhabitants of of Jerusalem
[17:19] [Music]
[17:20] and so as we read in the scripture
[17:24] the man of God was tipped
[17:28] someone came and told him
[17:31] you know all Kings have spies
[17:35] and so maybe one of his spies
[17:40] that is uh there's a conspiration a
[17:44] conspiration
[17:46] between the Three Kingdoms
[17:49] the kingdom of the moabites the kingdom
[17:52] of the uh of those men living in them
[17:57] says it and also there was another
[18:01] attacking of the ammonites
[18:03] and he said they have conspired against
[18:06] us
[18:08] and as I'm speaking to you
[18:27] [Music]
[18:39] [Music]
[18:54] [Music]
[19:02] and that's usually what happens to every
[19:05] believer
[19:07] when you are in a situation and you
[19:10] can't you know
[19:40] the only thing he could do was to
[19:42] retreat okay
[19:46] but that was not an option
[19:50] I want you to see the Believers the ones
[19:54] who believe this Bible
[19:56] who believe the message
[19:59] they never have an option of surrender
[20:07] among the options we have
[20:10] there is no option of retreat or
[20:12] Surrender
[20:15] why because we don't fight our own
[20:18] battles
[20:26] when he realized what was before
[20:29] immediately he went before God
[20:33] he began praying he began praying he
[20:38] reminded God
[20:40] this was the little Nation
[20:52] by killing us to tell God how can you
[20:56] let this happening
[20:59] here is a king going before God In
[21:01] Prayer
[21:04] a True Believer
[21:07] besides his battle in prayer
[21:10] that's why you're praying Christians
[21:18] but if you live a prayerless life
[21:24] you can never receive any victories
[21:30] but when he was first with the battle
[21:33] he realized the only thing he can do
[21:36] was not to cry
[21:39] crying does not move God
[21:42] do you know that when you are in a
[21:45] problem
[21:50] God just looks at you and wonders what
[21:54] is wrong with this
[21:56] crime does not move God
[21:58] does not move
[22:02] but there is something that moves
[22:05] amen that is prayer Sarah
[22:11] days of their voice Fellowship that we
[22:14] must learn how to pray
[22:16] you must learn how to pray
[22:19] when you are in your home you must learn
[22:21] how to pray
[22:22] [Music]
[22:23] your prayers
[22:29] pray until what the burden of your heart
[22:33] is
[22:35] until you feel God Amen your prayers
[22:38] touch God
[22:45] are you telling what I'm saying we
[22:48] should learn how to pray
[22:50] if we learn how to pray God is going to
[22:53] begin bringing victories on our side
[22:59] hallelujah amen so the king did not have
[23:03] an option of surrender
[23:05] because he knows God was with him
[23:09] the king and his people as any believers
[23:12] do
[23:12] opted to gather strength
[23:19] and confidence by the way of Prayer
[23:25] and our God when when called on is
[23:29] always a very present here foreign
[24:01] [Applause]
[24:50] gathered themselves together to ask to
[24:53] ask the help of the Lord even out of the
[24:55] of all the cities of Judah they came to
[24:57] seek the Lord and Jehoshaphat stood in
[24:59] the congregation of Judah and Jerusalem
[25:01] in the house of the Lord and before the
[25:03] new court and said
[25:06] oh Lord God of our fathers
[25:15] not thou over all the kingdoms of the of
[25:18] the heathens
[25:23] so that none is able to withstand this
[25:27] are you not our God
[25:31] who did drive out the inhabitants of
[25:34] this land before thy People Israel
[25:37] foreign
[25:50] um
[25:51] you drove out already inhabitants of
[25:54] this land
[25:56] and you gave it to the Seed of Abraham
[25:58] your friend forever no you will accept
[26:00] the day Ibrahimovic and they dwell
[26:03] therein and have built their Sanctuary
[26:05] therein for thy name
[26:09] and they were saying if when evil comes
[26:12] upon us
[26:14] as the sword Judgment of pestilence of
[26:18] famine
[26:21] they said we will stand before this
[26:24] house
[26:28] thy name is in this house
[26:31] and we shall cry out in our afflictions
[26:39] hallelujah amen the solution of a
[26:42] believer
[26:43] in a problem
[26:45] when you are he said sword
[26:49] or judgment over
[27:32] [Music]
[27:49] how they reward us now to come to cast
[27:52] us out of their position
[27:55] that has given us to inherit
[28:03] [Music]
[28:14] [Music]
[28:21] stood before the Lord
[28:27] with their little ones
[28:30] with their wives
[28:33] and their children
[28:36] in this prayer meeting
[28:40] there was the little children
[28:44] one of the wives the women
[28:46] and the men
[28:48] everyone
[28:50] meaning this was the most important
[28:54] meeting
[28:56] the most important service
[29:03] when Believers don't come to a prayer
[29:05] meeting
[29:07] it's a clear sign that they don't even
[29:09] pray at their homes
[29:12] in their lives they don't pray
[29:15] but in this prayer meeting
[29:19] their wives their little ones their
[29:22] children everyone
[29:27] they were all calling upon the Lord
[29:30] even the king himself
[29:37] but let me tell you when you cook when
[29:39] something like this happens
[29:42] God must always speak foreign
[31:42] you know the the presence of God
[31:47] amen
[31:57] [Music]
[32:05] and at that moment
[32:08] one brother who was also among them
[32:12] fearful
[32:14] shaking like the rest of them but then
[32:17] the spirit of God
[32:19] it came on him that's why we believe in
[32:22] the gifts of the holy spirit
[32:26] now if you didn't believe these things
[32:31] the church would be dead
[32:33] We Believe In Dreams
[32:37] in Prophecy
[32:39] we believe in tongues an interpretation
[32:43] of tongues
[32:44] these are the gifts of the Spirit you
[32:48] believe in preaching because through
[32:50] these gifts God comes down and he speaks
[32:54] to the child
[32:56] but now you see if these people didn't
[32:59] believe it
[33:00] if they despise what God was saying
[33:05] this one is also just getting excited
[33:07] foreign
[33:49] [Music]
[34:11] they come up
[34:13] I love I love I love prophecy when God
[34:17] speaks it is
[34:18] [Music]
[34:21] he says go against them
[34:23] because they are coming
[34:26] by the grief of this again
[34:29] [Music]
[34:32] and he shall find them at the end of the
[34:34] brook
[34:38] before the Wilderness
[34:42] your enemies
[34:44] and it's going to pass by
[34:49] foreign
[35:13] the movement
[35:15] of the soldier is kept as a secret
[35:17] because
[35:23] if your enemy knows how you're going to
[35:24] move
[35:27] you are finished he will just come and
[35:32] Ambush you now
[35:35] they were coming Secrets
[35:40] but if you go in prayer
[35:43] God reveals the plan
[35:47] God reveals
[35:54] [Music]
[35:59] is it just a dream
[36:07] how is plotting to come yeah God is
[36:10] trying to say that is
[36:13] [Applause]
[36:17] I even know how your enemies
[36:20] and when the enemy comes in like a
[36:23] flower
[36:23] the spirit of God raises
[36:29] and at that moment he said he shall not
[36:33] need oh my good Lord hey
[36:41] hallelujah amen tell your neighbor you
[36:43] will not need to fight again louder
[36:54] amen oh my how many feel excited today
[36:58] hallelujah amen he said search
[37:01] yourselves
[37:03] such yourselves
[37:05] yes set yourselves
[37:32] for the Lord will be with you
[37:37] Hallelujah
[37:40] and that was a prophecy or when nobody
[37:43] will not be that came out of prayer
[37:46] and when the Believers had that
[37:49] oh hallelujah hallelujah
[37:53] you know the Bible says
[37:57] he says despise not prophesy
[38:02] in first Thessalonians
[38:09] as long as the people believed God
[38:12] [Music]
[38:13] and their prophets their preachers
[38:21] said believe God
[38:35] believe it
[38:38] believe it is
[38:45] you see they have surrendered
[38:48] these people they surrender their
[38:49] responsibility
[38:52] of fighting
[38:54] to God
[38:56] say God I'm no longer going to fight
[38:59] them I just believe what you say
[39:02] your word must fulfill this is
[39:18] I don't know why some Believers like
[39:20] fighting for themselves
[39:23] brother don't fight for yourself
[39:27] and if you don't pray you are someone
[39:30] who is fighting for yourself
[39:36] but if you learn how to pray
[39:39] you've come to this place of saying
[39:43] take it to the Lord in prayer
[39:48] if you take something before the Lord
[39:55] it is the beginning
[39:56] it's just like when
[39:59] where a child takes a kiss to his father
[40:01] [Music]
[40:03] or his mother and says
[40:10] does it stop there because
[40:15] this child expects
[40:18] the father or the mother
[40:22] to ask where did he beat you you say
[40:26] here and he will do he wants comfortable
[40:30] he wants the other things for you to
[40:33] revenge
[40:36] and so the father will say called the
[40:40] one who beat you
[40:41] tell him to come here no
[40:48] foreign
[41:45] hallelujah amen as I was studying this I
[41:49] was so excited but never then
[41:51] to know that God told them
[41:55] he spoke to the through the prophecy
[42:00] you will not need to fight
[42:12] it is finished
[42:13] but if I you find people fighting their
[42:15] battles
[42:18] people going to witchcraft
[42:23] and even some Believers think about it
[42:27] you know it's just Africans
[42:36] let me tell you if you go to be with
[42:39] someone born again you're fighting your
[42:42] own battles
[42:45] if someone has done you bad um
[42:48] do them well
[42:50] it is so bad it's so maybe it's so sad
[42:54] God before the Lord in prayer foreign
[43:45] battles
[43:47] prayer is not just talking to God
[43:50] in the beginning
[43:53] you're talking to God you are asking him
[43:56] to come and begin fighting your battles
[44:00] that's why prayer is a two-way thing
[44:06] when you go in prayer you are reporting
[44:09] the matter and God is deploying the
[44:12] swords
[44:16] in the places he knows that amen that
[44:20] you can that that your enemies are
[44:22] coming
[44:23] that's why when we go in spiritual a
[44:26] spiritual LED prayer
[44:29] anointed by the holy ghosts
[44:34] the Bible says even the spirit himself
[44:37] he will make intercession
[45:43] the Bible say
[45:49] [Applause]
[46:24] hallelujah amen Our God
[46:28] isn't lift up your heads
[46:31] lift them up when you get it yeah
[46:35] Everlasting doors
[46:43] our God is foreign
[47:44] that way
[47:46] that's why when you go to prayer your
[47:49] angel goes at work
[47:51] hallelujah amen These Are Spiritual
[47:54] things you need to understand
[48:49] [Music]
[48:54] God knows
[48:56] foreign
[49:01] that's why it says I am sheltered
[49:04] in the arms of God
[49:07] let the storms
[49:10] Hallelujah you won't worry
[49:20] how can we be shouted when we can pray
[49:25] our Victory as Believers
[49:28] fought in prayer
[49:33] when we go to prayer together brother
[49:36] Dixon are you in the church with us
[49:39] when you were in prayer when you go on
[49:42] your knees
[49:45] God must hear that prayer
[49:48] employees the armies of Heaven
[49:52] God is the best on the earth
[49:57] I can give you some examples
[50:01] and all the examples
[50:04] of all the battles God foreign
[50:09] foreign
[50:19] talk about the battle between Gideon and
[50:21] the Americas
[50:23] do you remember that one
[50:27] how Gideon had a great great big army
[50:31] and God told him scale it down
[50:36] scale it down I don't want you to go
[50:41] and fight
[50:45] so that at the end you will say you are
[50:49] the one who forgot me yeah
[50:53] foreign
[51:19] so that no one will take glorified
[51:24] that's why sometimes you reach into
[51:27] places of frustration
[51:31] as if everyone has ignored you
[51:35] God is just trying to slap you
[51:39] um
[51:41] so you can now learn how to pray
[51:45] God wants you to depend on him and him
[51:47] alone
[51:54] from from all that huge Amen
[51:58] to just three thousand people 300 people
[52:02] and you know how he is he reached that
[52:05] number um
[52:08] go by the water
[52:11] I will tell you how to trim the Army
