for them the truth is that people despise amazing foreign foreign foreign is right down now in it yeah this is what I heard you know a manga they say it good they need you to help me obey you come on I need you myself to worship take off all depression fill me the Holy Spirit I went to school oh I did a lot of things by the end of first time I would come back and I I had lost everything I came back home foreign foreign unless you're going to apologize that it wasn't going towards something else so I came back okay it's very encouraging me tell me something I went to school I started struggling I could pray I used to go to that shop it's academic Chapel but I would go and Japan [Music] I remember one time it was a life-changing moment for me I got a friend no I used to go into the chapel again everyone would even if you get someone who has never prayed yeah two weeks to your name or a week and find people in the chapel over I don't know if you know it's uh it's a small house a very small house where mother Mary is we'd find people there at one awesome praying seriously this time I was walking in Chapel with my friends he was just joining us I think it was supposed to go for a discussion so he said yeah you know discussion so let us go to Japan and you shall come back together with Chapel for him I was working with them um I have something to tell you and they said they're going to tell us something else University [Music] you can tell someone you love them but this surprised me what I was supposed to was I love God very much I realized there was a connection video um I'm wearing the statue feeling me the Holy Spirit I'm going to request you not to clap yeah because it may be sad or upset so during the sector convention the last day petroleum when they called um people who wanted to receive the audience so I knelt down your nailed down like in front of the projector projector so I was praying I told God so the beginning of life I've been reminding God all these things and this was for last year yeah God you keep your promises from the first from the from first January I know I've done a lot of mistakes then I felt a hit name it covered a lot of stuff but I I felt Wicked and then I went on my hands like I was kneeling so later it was from a project so when I got up I got very weekend hours like hey good even this can happen I almost for sure at that point you can lose your faith yeah so that's what happened [Music] bites I I felt very weak and I wanted to tell personally identical question tell him that is before God makes a move that before God makes the movement also tries to make his move I went back to my seat I thought about it I was like oh my god oh come on then I started comparing the Heat the first hit it passed on me and I felt it was more um there was something comes like this so I I left it to God cartoon is that if I didn't receive it that day and they will try to impersonate it means mine is coming their money but I also believe I got it very different you don't see it by the way when I'm notifying none of your noise foreign foreign [Music] amen breakfast amen I'm sorry for you know it was unavoidable but I also believe with brother polka that something happened if you have ever sold the Holy Ghost that there was some time he comes to disapprove but I believe something might have happened amen brothership foreign you have just preached in one second it was a powerful one like I shouldn't say something amen I thank God for your presence for everyone's presence and then and I thank God who led my brother from a second he came at night but he is I've been trying to highlight my testimony it is much the repetitive I can't finish it without but I think I violated some importance you know throughout the year since Jan last year God has really been manifesting himself through my life first of all right it's okay I'm really grateful for brother Isaac where is he I was also surprised by his testimony and I can say that God can change and I've learned something that it's not good to judge who used to judge him I remember we gave him a name a nickname yeah we used to call him mojosi because he used to be involved most of his time in news politics and when it comes to the word of God is but I was so surprised I was I was blessed by his testimony and so far the time I've been with him so if I can say that he's no longer that much in politics I can testify that it is I think that name should stop anyway uh I want to say something on that name personal I didn't know but I think brother shame we share the name but we share but it got a different meaning so on my side I also want to clarify it it was not because of that but uh when past since it was uh his pastor's son to me I called him morozi I was calling him like the first design is the past son of the world but there is aspect why I made him like that why I called him but it was on that not only argumentative side okay yeah so I will talk about my school life um you know I've just completed High School um the full amount even before the times and at school I can say I was respected yeah so I thank God for that is yeah now um I will not feel ashamed to say this that in all my school life I didn't have any girlfriend yeah they could come and tell you they love you somewhere foreign but I thank God that I stood farm and I was able to witness to all my friends none of my friends and I tried my best to bring him to church somewhere foreign to make sure that I leader another thing I thank God this last year they never wanted me dead Satani yeah two times the first time you remember then the second death it was physical of course I will not go in details of the first day okay I think he was shocked also yeah so the second um and I just felt like I should walk I'm not used to work but that time I said and the reason why I was walking is I wanted to move when listening the message by the time you move from school up to here yeah so as I was listening that someone near you and I reached Northern bypass I think those bad guys the thugs they saw my phone like I moved my phone to check on the time but now this is really I can't tell what will happen but yes they pierced my hand with a sharp object they sang above nature into H4 meter and I was unconscious because there is literally and then because I was over bleeding I bleeded like three kilograms is foreign but you see the good thing it was the right motive why I decided to work believe that the angel of God and I believe there is a purpose foreign I really really thank God between Cuba is a new controller and another thing that I thank God for the chamber is a cartoon is that I remember last year we pledged for our church building funds woke up with the way I'm assente is and I thank God that I've never missed in a month I would like to double my pleasures and also naturally I don't know um we didn't give it so since I really thank God and you can on the paper I was supposed to put my name and his name foreign [Music] as we are all gathered here that the blood of Jesus Christ makes us once we are so happy for that I thank God so

me courage foreign God bless you Saints start with this song it's called through the fire so many times I've questioned citing circumstances or things I could not under stand and many times in Trials
