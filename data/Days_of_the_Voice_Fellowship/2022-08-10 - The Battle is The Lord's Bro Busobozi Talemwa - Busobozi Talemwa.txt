discharged otherwise our time is first spent and i ask that you check your bibles if you have a bible whatever you can say in the bible if you do not have a bible i'm encouraging each of you to buy a bible we go to first samuel chapter 17. my name is samuel estudio and we are reading verses 47. b foreign everybody there immediate soccer coming up on amazon um reading verse 47 says and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord is and he will give you into our hands let it encourage us continue working as soldiers i mean now when we talk about battle but okay we'll talk about fighting we talk about two forces again [Music] and the christian journey really is a battle organ amazing it's not just sailing through sitting it's a battle that we fight every day so we have an enemy no truly normal is for a few moments tonight i'd like us to talk about this battle and then for samuel 17 he says and all this assembly shall know that the lord saveth not with sword and spear for the battle is the lord is our god does not save you because you fall with a spear or with a sword over you see all these sufferings and the problems we go through in this world it's not ours to fight or tell us that you are in christ since the grace sister grace of christ it's not yours to fight or tell us is there anybody here in christ be in christ he is a new [Music] which means i am not mine but i am of the lord it's a that's why the bible says unto them that stumble the children of god [Applause] you remember that one day when moses is his wife but you created me one muslim you know this king wanted to take her care and you know he lied about it he said she is my sister but you see remember he was a son of god of that god was ready to fight his battle he was he had even told a lie [Music] and god fights for all his possessions oh that belongs to god god always claims it not people but also things sinnoh wobble and heavy into whatever is of god god claims it canadian catholic and he came to that king and he said get ready you are going to die but i have done whatever god became like uh you know appeased god it the word of god satan inaudible if you remember when jesus the bible talks of jesus when he went uh after he had fasted for 40 days and he was coming down nakawansi then that's where the devil met i was standing i'm sinking now we begin to paint physical images you see jesus was there and the devil was there and we were walking together yesterday was speaking to jesus in his mind if you be the son of god women are catholic command these stones to be made brave if you be the son of a man you know for you know just jump off this building he's saying [Music] [Music] [Applause] is to engage in a fight against something you know people fight every day but here we have among all those who have been great fighters in the world the greatest of them is jesus is called the mighty conquerors conquer the hell death and the christ he says now this greatest contest has been going on for many years it started in heaven and saturn was kicked out into the earth people across the fires throw them into into his fires but we know that who has the most power and too and he wants to throw the children of god into hallelujah amen don't think even that god will make a fire for the devil now god will throw the devil into his own fire [Music] amen praise the name of the lord hallelujah and he says it becomes our strength the word of god is our stretch man you got faith but the word of god is my amen but he says again and the third goes on that jesus said in mark 16 in my name they shall cast out them yes and this battle began in heaven and there was war in heaven these angels fought against a dragon and a dragon fought on his angels in your mind let me tell you he thought he can defeat jesus even in his own heavens his own [Music] you know as he was beginning you know he said well i feel like uh i can be lifted you know what the devil then began to uh you know to lift himself up onto the throne of god and you see god is god when you get told that you can turn down and it does change to do something you're back which and not is to manifest himself in a way yes we're talking about the angelic realms you're talking about the devil in the form of angel know in the form of spirit talking about standing god he wasn't flesh and blood but then also god was a spirit he was not flesh and blessed see god could not stoop so lord to fight the devil himself you know god had to come in now i might as well say that michael was uh was a representation of god in the angelic just like jesus is the manifestation or representation of god in the human form [Music] came down so he was no longer lucifer now he became dragons he became a monster he became devil i know his name and so michael fought against [Music] even i don't know how they chassis he speaks to them and he inspires them you know he commanded all these [Music] [Music] and authority now you've been stripped of all the power command hallelujah amen the battle is the lord the battle is the lord oh my we are fighting and the battle is the lord i don't tell you and he prevailed neither was their place found anymore in heaven let me tell you something when the devil failed [Music] [Music] whatever angular it means he has no more blessing in my life amen that's why he says did not prevail [Applause] hallelujah when the devil comes and fights you standing by you can see that disease [Applause] did not and cannot have any more blessings for music the joy of the lord will be your stress it's not what hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah and the great dragon was cast out of that old sapping called the devil and saturn which deceived the is deceiving them into the garden [Music] i got you he overcame eve now angular again he overcame now i'm gonna add them that is done i got my moments they're finished but you're additionally finished you were dead he said his finish i got you a day oh my goodness they never made the biggest mystery he thought the battle was battling hallelujah where [Applause] because he could not remember he could whenever he would come close to jesus he would smell now something that happened but again he would see god [Music] um he said now the best way i can do this i know i'm going to go and again in one of the unconverted followers and i will become him that way how i would be able to find out whether you're the one just yeah as a matter of fact namaste i'm even going to go in the most trusted ones the one that keeps the money oh yeah the hidden sights the one who was always excited in chat we should make our own ends we should make we should meet our own ends because we cannot just follow blindly and maybe he told one of the brothers this jesus could really be good we it was the devil theory you knew how to speak a brethren in his language and you see at that moment he went i know where oh hallelujah hallelujah i'm gonna show them this is my lord oh no come around no one talks with you that's why i am alive um son of he said but let me follow do not follow after money on the things of the world again i cannot wait to see my lord being killed in that moment just say that he went and hanged him and he had to go and die now another but all this even of your now god name the devil thought by coming in judas there is nothing that can that was his victory [Music] and as i'm speaking to you when you're getting a jimmy he's about to be locked up with the rest of them because people never never need in here so friends the quran is party people can be happy angels can be we're impressing i thought it wasn't again again i'm not just hyper sizing i i am speaking reality these things happen are you gonna be too cold and in hell green i'm sure that was a nightmare they enjoyed this they danced those demons if they were to drink alcohol i'm sure they drank a lot of it [Music] if you go there progender you are just going in here against them okay now those clubs are hell um and i have no apologies for that i will stay tuned because that's the truth come on again for all the inspiration and uh and uh in hell okay now they have those kind of whatever but you remember that there was a moment when i could say that when jesus came right there yes hallelujah i say hallelujah hallelujah do i have the demon of of what yes do i have the demon of prophet president sir okay when you come on anyone do i have the demon of of depression you know yes sir i'm president come along right all the demons present with your nung away and as they were taking the last one huh oh victorian [Applause] no matter how much [Music] oh [Music] it's not just placing them down and bringing into captivity [Applause] to the obedience of christ jesus christ what are your thoughts hello listen to me church praise the canister the word of god right now [Music] oh my god amen where are you hallelujah [Music] let me let him of himself think this again then we are always that as he is christians we are angry even also we are nothing and we are telling you you
