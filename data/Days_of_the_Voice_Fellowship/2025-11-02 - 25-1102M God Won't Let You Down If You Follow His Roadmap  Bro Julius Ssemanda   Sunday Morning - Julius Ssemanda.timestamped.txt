[4:00] in this sacred our Lord
[4:04] we are so grateful for the privilege
[4:08] of the gift of life for having enabled
[4:11] us to be here not because of our own
[4:15] righteousness Lord
[4:18] but what you did for us at Calvary.
[4:21] We are so grateful. Loving king of
[4:24] glory, our redeemer.
[4:26] We come as we are, but we want to go
[4:29] back when we are changed, transformed
[4:32] according to thy word. May you come and
[4:35] speak to each and every one of us this
[4:37] morning. Father, we pray, we commit thy
[4:42] servant who is going to come here and
[4:45] stand before us. Lord, he's coming to
[4:48] speak not his own word but your word.
[4:53] May you prepare each and every one of
[4:55] us. Lord, may you circumcise our hearts

[5:33] needs this morning, Father, because
[5:36] you're more than able.

[5:41] are in need of. We commit the tithes and
[5:45] offering that your children are going to
[5:47] give up. For you said you always bless a
[5:50] cheerful giver. Bless each and every one
[5:53] of them. Lord, we commit those who are
[5:57] on online
[5:59] as they are going to gather also.
[6:02] Father, may you talk to them in a
[6:05] special way the way you're going to
[6:07] speak to us this morning. And we
[6:09] continue committing our dear pastor into
[6:12] your hands. Lord, may you keep him. Let
[6:16] your purpose be fulfilled in his life.
[6:19] Wherever he is, let your glory be seen
[6:23] in him. as you'll be seen in us this
[6:26] morning. Father, make us more than ready
[6:29] because the time is nigh. We need to be
[6:32] more than ready than ever before. Come,

[6:38] commit each and everything into your
[6:40] hands, praying and believing all this,

[6:47] and wonderful name of our Lord Jesus
[6:49] Christ, we do pray and believe.

[7:36] where they are, I say, "Oh, my sins are

[33:12] that will bless your heart.
[33:21] I bring you more than a song.
[33:26] For a song in itself
[33:29] is not what you
[33:34] [Music]
[33:39] search most
[33:42] within
[33:44] through the way things are.
[33:48] You're looking into my eyes.

[34:58] prayer
[35:01] [Applause]
[35:04] I'll bring you more than a song
[35:09] for a song itself
[35:12] is not what you have required.
[35:20] through such deeper within
[35:25] through the way things have been. You're
[35:29] looking into my eyes.
[35:37] I'm coming back to the
[35:42] washing.
[35:44] When it's all about you.
[35:49] When it's all about you, Jesus.

[1:11:38] Take the flesh aside.
[1:11:41] Receive us Lord.
[1:11:44] Speak to me Lord.
[1:11:46] Let it be a personal talk with you.
[1:11:51] Let it be an encounter with God.
[1:11:55] Let this be a divine appointment. Let
[1:11:59] one's life today. Come and change life,
[1:12:03] the lives of the people. Come and
[1:12:06] deliver. Come and break the chains.
[1:12:10] Come and save.
[1:12:12] Come and provide.
[1:12:14] Come and supply. Come and do miracles.
[1:12:18] Come and do signs and wonders. Come and
[1:12:21] reveal yourself. Come and inspire.
[1:12:25] Come and anoint. Come and do what no man
[1:12:28] can do. Come and do the impossible.
[1:12:32] Come and do a paradox today.
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; Father, come and give testimonies
[1:12:39] as we have come. Lord, let no none go
[1:12:42] back disappointed.
[1:12:45] Search the secrets of the heart.
[1:12:47] Address every need.
[1:12:50] Let the devil know that Jesus Christ is
[1:12:54] in the midst of his people, the captain
[1:12:57] of the army of the Lord. Heavenly
[1:12:59] Father, I get out of the way. These
[1:13:03] people don't need a man. They need a
[1:13:06] living God. FATHER, THESE PEOPLE DON'T
[1:13:08] need me. They need God. May I be just be
[1:13:12] a channel. Set us on fire, Lord, and do
[1:13:16] that, Lord.
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; That has never been
[1:13:20] that Lord Jesus we shall say not our
[1:13:23] hearts burn within us as he spoke to us.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus I now surrender to you. I
[1:13:31] commit every individual into your hands.
[1:13:34] Every heart here Lord touch every
[1:13:37] individual.
[1:13:39] Touch every individual.
[1:13:41] Let every seat Lord the angel of God
[1:13:45] move there.
[1:13:47] Oh father, you said that the angel of
[1:13:50] God moves with this message
[1:13:54] wherever it's preached. Father, as we
[1:13:57] open the pages of the Bible, you are the
[1:13:59] author of this word.
[1:14:02] &gt;&gt; Come and take the word,
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; quicken it now, press it into the hearts
[1:14:08] of the people.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; Let it bring forth life
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; today, Father. Not tomorrow but today.
[1:14:17] Address the needs of today
[1:14:19] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:14:22] Father we pray believing
[1:14:24] in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:40] Seems the children are louder.
[1:14:43] Today I don't know whether it's
[1:14:46] rejoicing or they are praising
[1:14:51] the children are so excited
[1:14:54] but that's fine.
[1:14:58] He says let the little children come to
[1:15:00] me.
[1:15:07] I may not need a coach.
[1:15:12] I need this gospel jacket.
[1:15:18] Amen.
[1:15:20] God richly bless you.
[1:15:24] Thank you for coming to church today
[1:15:27] and I greet you in the name of the Lord
[1:15:29] Jesus.
[1:15:32] I'm glad to be here today
[1:15:36] together with you.
[1:15:40] Amen.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Every time you come to church,
[1:15:45] be ready to receive a new version of
[1:15:47] yourself.
[1:15:52] You receive a new version of who you
[1:15:53] are.
[1:15:57] You go back a different person.
[1:16:00] be determined to go back a better man,
[1:16:05] better Christian,
[1:16:07] better wife, better husband,
[1:16:10] better worker,

[1:16:17] If you are sick, you go back here.
[1:16:20] You come with a need, you go back to
[1:16:22] settled.
[1:16:24] We don't come to speak to you
[1:16:29] WORDS OF VANITY
[1:16:31] OR STORIES.
[1:16:33] THE BIBLE SAYS WE HAVE NOT FALL AFTER
[1:16:36] CUNNINGLY GRAFTED FABLES.
[1:16:40] But we HAVE A SURE WORD OF PROPHECY.
[1:16:43] ACTUALLY SAYS A MORE WORD OF PROPHECY.
[1:16:48] Since it IS A MORE SURE WORD OF
[1:16:50] PROPHECY,
[1:16:52] MORE SURE.
[1:16:54] IT MAKES US MORE THAN CONQUERORS.
[1:16:59] NOTHING. WE DON'T KNOW WHICH CONQUERORS
[1:17:00] WE ARE. WE ARE JUST MORE THAN CONQUERORS
[1:17:05] BECAUSE WE HAVE THE LIVING WORD, THE
[1:17:08] LIVING GOD, THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE
[1:17:11] MESSAGE OF THE HOUR THAT PRESSES US
[1:17:14] RIGHT IN OUR POSITION IN CHRIST.
[1:17:19] SO BE DETERMINED TO GO BACK A DIFFERENT
[1:17:22] DIRECTION.
[1:17:24] AMEN. BROTHER, SISTER, today

[1:18:19] OF MY MIND.
[1:18:21] I'M TAKING THE MIND OF CHRIST.
[1:18:24] I mean every word that I'M SAYING
[1:18:27] THAT IT IS THE word of God.
[1:18:30] Hallelujah. Brother, sister, we don't
[1:18:33] COME HERE FOR JOKES.
[1:18:36] WE COME HERE TO ADDRESS ISSUES.
[1:18:39] WE COME HERE TO SOLVE PROBLEMS.

[1:18:44] AND TO GET SOLUTIONS

[1:19:08] YOU WATER THE WHAT? THEN SOMETHING
[1:19:10] HAPPENS.
[1:19:12] HALLELUJAH.
[1:19:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:19:16] Our brother, sister.
[1:19:24] &gt;&gt; This is more like it's more than it's
[1:19:27] just like heaven.

[1:19:38] need to be on.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:47] &gt;&gt; We have an announcement an announcement
[1:19:49] here from our dear pastor.
[1:19:54] Uh he went for a missionary trip in
[1:19:56] Canada
[1:19:59] and uh believe you are praying for him.
[1:20:04] He says next Sunday we have a special
[1:20:06] service with a visiting minister from
[1:20:08] Nairobi.
[1:20:13] Actually said greet the church.
[1:20:16] So receive greetings from the pastor.
[1:20:20] Amen. He loves you so much.
[1:20:24] He says we have a visiting minister next
[1:20:26] Sunday from Nairobi.
[1:20:31] Nairobi, Kenya.
[1:20:32] &gt;&gt; Nairobi, Kenya.
[1:20:33] &gt;&gt; Brother Kennedal.
[1:20:37] Uh, please everyone ensure not to miss.
[1:20:42] Come on.
[1:20:44] Come pray.
[1:20:47] God has a word for you.
[1:20:51] If you come to church, pray it down.
[1:20:55] You receive something.
[1:21:00] It doesn't matter how much the minister
[1:21:02] comes is anointed,
[1:21:05] so prayed up, so inspired,
[1:21:10] it won't do any good.
[1:21:13] If you are not anointed,
[1:21:16] the prophet said, "It doesn't matter how
[1:21:18] much he anoints me.
[1:21:24] It won't do you any good if he does not
[1:21:27] anoint you.
[1:21:31] So it's not about he is anointed
[1:21:34] pastor is anointed of God is anointed.
[1:21:37] The prophet is anointed.
[1:21:40] YOU ALSO BE ANOINTED.
[1:21:42] YOU ALSO BE INSPIRED.
[1:21:45] YOU ALSO BE PRAYED UP. YOU ALSO BE
[1:21:48] EXPECTANT.
[1:21:50] HALLELUJAH.
[1:21:53] Come that way. Come that way.
[1:21:56] Sister Brenda from
[1:22:00] please you are most welcome.
[1:22:03] Wave to us.
[1:22:06] You are most welcome. God richer bless
[1:22:08] you.
[1:22:10] You have not come to a wrong place
[1:22:13] and it's not the only place.
[1:22:17] There are many others
[1:22:20] but you have come in God's presence.
[1:22:25] We welcome you feel at home and anytime
[1:22:29] you wish to
[1:22:32] the doors are open.
[1:22:34] God rich bless you.
[1:22:37] Let us turn to Job
[1:22:45] chapter 23
[1:22:48] verse three.
[1:22:51] Oh, that I knew where I might find him,
[1:22:56] that I might come even to his seat. Job
[1:23:00] 23:3.
[1:23:12] If I KNEW WHERE I MIGHT FIND GOD,
[1:23:18] THAT I MIGHT COME EVEN to his seat.
[1:23:23] He had an issue.
[1:23:26] He said, "TODAY IS MY COMPLAINT. PETER,
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:33] my cloning is too loud.
[1:23:37] If I knew WHERE I MIGHT FIND GOD,
[1:23:42] that I might come even to his seat."
[1:23:46] And in John 14:6, he says,
[1:23:53] Jesus says unto him,
[1:23:56] "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[1:24:00] No man cometh unto the Father but by
[1:24:02] me."
[1:24:10] Hebrews 13:8 says
[1:24:14] Jesus Christ
[1:24:16] the same
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; yesterday
[1:24:20] and today
[1:24:22] and forever.
[1:24:26] Amen.
[1:24:28] Are we together?
[1:24:30] You may take your seats.
[1:24:33] Father, in the name of Jesus,
[1:24:36] We have read of your word.
[1:24:39] Open it in wisdom, in revelation and
[1:24:44] inspiration.
[1:24:46] Anoint us. Anoint your people. Bless us
[1:24:50] all in Jesus name. Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God richer bless you.
[1:24:59] Amen.
[1:25:06] Amen.
[1:25:10] It's kind of hard
[1:25:15] to stand here
[1:25:18] and talk to the children of God
[1:25:23] because
[1:25:27] it's not that the people are too great,
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; but what makes them great
[1:25:36] &gt;&gt; is because they have been purchased
[1:25:41] with a great price.
[1:25:44] The precious blood of the lamb.
[1:25:48] So what makes the people of God great
[1:25:53] is what he purchased them with.
[1:25:58] Hallelujah. So it's you can't come and
[1:26:01] start to play before them.
[1:26:05] Seek your own glory.
[1:26:08] and things like that.
[1:26:10] You have got to to be sober.
[1:26:15] So and the people also
[1:26:19] have got to believe
[1:26:22] the preacher.
[1:26:25] God told brother
[1:26:28] if you can get the people to believe you
[1:26:34] no not disease shall stand before your
[1:26:37] prayer
[1:26:38] [Music]
[1:26:40] not even canc.
[1:26:43] The people have got to believe their
[1:26:45] channel.
[1:26:48] Then believe what comes out of the
[1:26:51] channel.
[1:26:53] If it matches with us,
[1:26:56] they must believe
[1:26:59] that this is God's time.
[1:27:02] This is God's divine plan.
[1:27:06] Then you WILL GO OUT WITH SOMETHING.
[1:27:11] I want us to talk about my subject is
[1:27:15] God won't turn you down
[1:27:20] if you follow the road map.
[1:27:29] God won't TURN YOU DOWN
[1:27:32] IF YOU FOLLOW HIS road map.
[1:27:37] No, HE CAN'T TURN YOU DOWN. HE CAN'T LET
[1:27:40] YOU GO DISAPPOINTED
[1:27:43] if you follow his road map.
[1:27:46] If God HAS GOT ANYTHING
[1:27:50] WITH HIM,
[1:27:52] it must be for his people,
[1:27:55] ALL THE RICHES AND HIS GLORY,
[1:27:58] ALL HIS POWER. HE SAYS MY POWER IS
[1:28:01] YOURS.
[1:28:03] WHY HE OVERCAME?
[1:28:05] HE OVERCAME FOR YOU. WHY JESUS TOOK YOUR
[1:28:09] SINS THAT YOU MIGHT BECOME THE
[1:28:11] RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD.
[1:28:14] BUT HOW TO ATTAIN THAT?
[1:28:17] THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY. SO IF EASY
[1:28:20] PEOPLE
[1:28:22] if if if IF WHAT IF GOD HAS SOMETHING
[1:28:27] IT
[1:28:29] HAVING IT FOR HIMSELF
[1:28:33] it doesn't DO HIM ANY GOOD.
[1:28:35] IT HAS GOT TO BE FOR EASY PEOPLE
[1:28:38] BECAUSE OUR GOD IS NOT A SELFISH GOD.
[1:28:43] Our God IS NOT A SELFSEED GOD.
[1:28:48] HE THINKS ABOUT HIS PEOPLE
[1:28:51] MORE THAN HE THINKS ABOUT HIMSELF.
[1:28:54] HE'S A GOOD FATHER BECAUSE A FATHER
[1:28:58] EXPRESSES
[1:29:00] SACRIFICIAL LOVE.
[1:29:02] THE EXPRESSIONS OF GOD
[1:29:06] AND HIS DESIRES
[1:29:08] ARE FOR HIS PEOPLE. THAT'S WHY HE SAYS,
[1:29:12] "MY THOUGHTS TOWARDS YOU
[1:29:15] ARE TOO GREAT. EVERY CANNOT BE NUMBERED.
[1:29:20] IF I COULD THINK ABOUT THEM, THEY ARE
[1:29:23] MORE THAN STAND UP FOR
[1:29:26] DAY AND NIGHT. HE THINKS ABOUT YOU. WHAT
[1:29:30] SHOULD I DO FOR JULIUS?
[1:29:32] OH, I KNOW HE WILL TURN THIS WAY. HOW
[1:29:35] CAN I GET HIM THAT WAY? WHAT SHOULD I DO
[1:29:38] FOR BROTHER JONAH?
[1:29:40] I KNOW HE DESIRE SUCH AND SUCH THING.
[1:29:42] OH, HE WON'T TURN YOU DOWN
[1:29:45] WHAT HE DOES NOW.
[1:29:49] Job had an issue.
[1:29:52] I said if I KNEW
[1:29:56] WHERE I CAN FIND HIM
[1:29:59] AND I go TO HIS SEAT
[1:30:02] AND I PLEAD MY CASE,
[1:30:05] I JUST REACH WHERE HE IS
[1:30:08] AND I PLEAD MY CASE.
[1:30:11] I KNOW he won't turn me down.
[1:30:14] I know he won't TURN ME DOWN.
[1:30:17] BUT HE HAD A QUESTION if I KNEW IF I
[1:30:21] KNEW
[1:30:24] NOW MAN IN HIS FOREIGN state cannot
[1:30:26] approach GOD
[1:30:30] BECAUSE IT'S WHY GOD DROVE away man.
[1:30:36] Adam and Eve he drove from them away
[1:30:38] from his presence.
[1:30:41] They could not commune with WITH HIM
[1:30:45] BECAUSE GOD cannot be where THERE IS A
[1:30:47] SIN.
[1:30:49] SO HE DROVE THEM AWAY FROM HIS PRESENCE.
[1:30:51] BUT GOD IS A GOOD GOD.
[1:30:54] HE HAD TO PROVIDE A WAY. HE DESIRES
[1:30:57] FELLOWSHIP WITHIN
[1:31:00] THE MIDST OF ALL THIS.
[1:31:03] WHEN THE THINGS HAPPENED
[1:31:05] THERE, THERE HAS GOT TO BE A WAY
[1:31:08] BACK TO GOD.
[1:31:11] THERE HAS GOT TO BE A ROAD
[1:31:13] AND THAT ROAD HAS GOT TO HAVE A MAP.
[1:31:18] HOW TO GET ABOUT THAT ROAD?
[1:31:21] WHEN GOD GIVES A ROAD,
[1:31:23] HE GIVES A MAP TO THE ROAD. YOU DON'T GO
[1:31:26] ABOUT IT.
[1:31:29] He has got A MAP TO THE ROAD.
[1:31:32] IT'S AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING
[1:31:35] there be anything GOOD FROM GOD
[1:31:39] ANYTHING GOOD IN HIM
[1:31:42] OF WHICH THERE IS MANY GREAT RICHES
[1:31:47] PRECIOUS THINGS
[1:31:49] WHICH ARE ETERNAL
[1:31:51] AND SOME ARE TEMPORAL
[1:31:54] THAT COME FROM OUR GOD
[1:31:57] AND OUR GOD IS THE ONLY FORM OF ETERNAL
[1:32:02] SO THE ONLY WAY
[1:32:04] GET THAT ETERNAL LIFE THERE'S GOT TO BE
[1:32:06] A ROAD
[1:32:09] MAN HAS ALWAYS
[1:32:12] MAN HAS ALWAYS
[1:32:15] LONGED FOR GOD
[1:32:17] LIKE JOB WAS LONGING.
[1:32:20] I WISH I COULD GO THERE
[1:32:23] DOWN IN HIS COURT.
[1:32:26] LET HIM KNOW ABOUT MY CONFIDENCE.
[1:32:29] THE BITTERNESS IN MY SOUL
[1:32:32] JUST DOWN.
[1:32:34] I'M SO DOWN. I WISH I COULD KNOW WHERE
[1:32:39] TO FIND THIS GOD.
[1:32:41] HE WOULD NOT TURN ME DOWN.
[1:32:44] HE LONGED TO SEEK GOD
[1:32:46] TO BE IN HIS PRESENCE TO GET BACK TO
[1:32:49] GOD.
[1:32:51] IT'S THE DESIRE OF EVERY MAN
[1:32:54] LONGING FOR GOD.
[1:32:57] BUT YET sometimes
[1:33:00] many think
[1:33:02] MANY THINK
[1:33:04] THAT BY WISDOM,
[1:33:07] SCIENCE,
[1:33:09] BY THEIR STRENGTH,
[1:33:12] BY KNOWLEDGE,
[1:33:14] THEY WANT TO MAKE A WAY
[1:33:17] FOR THEMSELVES BACK TO GOD.
[1:33:21] MAN HAS ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IT
[1:33:25] IN THEIR OWN WAY
[1:33:28] AND GOD HATES IT.
[1:33:31] WHEN MAN TRIES TO DO IT
[1:33:34] IN HIS OWN WAY BECAUSE ALL THE WAYS OF
[1:33:38] MAN
[1:33:40] NOT GOD'S WAY AND ALL THE IMAGINATIONS
[1:33:43] OF THE THOUGHT THERE
[1:33:46] ARE EVIL CONTINUE
[1:33:48] AND THAT'S THE TROUBLE OF IT TODAY
[1:33:52] WANT TO SEE GOD
[1:33:54] MANY WANT TO USE GOD THAT YOU CAN'T USE
[1:33:57] GOD
[1:33:59] WILL
[1:34:01] AND YOU WANT TO LET GO
[1:34:03] AND YOU CAN'T let go.
[1:34:08] BROTHER,
[1:34:10] THE PEOPLE TODAY
[1:34:12] SCRIPTURE SAYS THE WISDOM OF MEN IS THE
[1:34:16] FOOLISHNESS BEFORE GOD
[1:34:18] CANNOT PROSPER
[1:34:20] AND IT CAN'T WORK.
[1:34:23] GO BACK IN THE DAYS OF THE BABEL
[1:34:27] IN GENESIS 11. THE PEOPLE OF ONE
[1:34:30] LANGUAGE
[1:34:32] AND THEY UNITED THEMSELVES AND THEY MADE
[1:34:34] A GREAT DOMINATION
[1:34:37] AND they made a great DOMINATION
[1:34:40] FOR THEMSELVES
[1:34:44] AND THEY SAID GO TO NOW. LET US BUILD
[1:34:47] OURSELVES A
[1:34:50] GO. WHO'S THE TOP
[1:34:54] may reach UNTO HEAVEN?
[1:34:58] OH, THE TOP OF THE TOWER
[1:35:00] THAT CAN GET US UP UNTO HEAVEN
[1:35:06] and God saw that
[1:35:08] and he came down and he destroyed that
[1:35:13] and HE SCATTERED THEM.
[1:35:16] SO THE WISDOM OF THE WISE
[1:35:18] SHALL ALWAYS FAIL.
[1:35:21] BUT GOD EXALTS THE ENEMY
[1:35:25] AND GOD
[1:35:27] I'M TALKING ABOUT OUR GOD
[1:35:30] IN SIMPLICITY
[1:35:32] THE SIMPLIST OF GOD.
[1:35:34] YOU DON'T NEED A PSYCHOP.
[1:35:39] YOU DON'T NEED A PSYCHOPEDIA.
[1:35:42] YOU DON'T NEED TO BE ELOQUENT.
[1:35:45] You don't NEED TO KNOW TOO MUCH OF
[1:35:46] ENGLISH.
[1:35:48] AND YOU KNOW HIM THE LORD JESUS.
[1:35:52] THAT'S LIFE.
[1:35:54] THERE HAS GOT TO BE A PROVIDER
[1:35:57] ACCEPTABLE TO GOD
[1:36:00] THROUGH WHICH MAN
[1:36:02] CAN APPROACH
[1:36:04] THE LIVING GOD
[1:36:07] AND RECEIVE
[1:36:09] THAT WHICH IS HIDDEN
[1:36:11] IN HIM. THE SCRIPTURE SAYS THE HIDDEN
[1:36:15] WISDOM
[1:36:16] OF GOD, THE MYSTERY OF GOD
[1:36:20] WHICH WE SPEAK IN WISDOM,
[1:36:22] THE PRINCESS OF THIS WORLD DO NOT KNOW
[1:36:25] ABOUT.
[1:36:28] LISTEN BROTHER TODAY
[1:36:32] IS NOT BY POWER.
[1:36:34] IT'S NOT BY MIGHTY. IT'S BY THE SPIRIT
[1:36:36] OF GOD.
[1:36:38] THAT'S THE WISDOM OF GOD.
[1:36:41] GOD GAVE MAN
[1:36:44] his desire
[1:36:47] but man still fail to SEE
[1:36:53] besides God providing a way.
[1:36:58] Not many are able to walk in it.
[1:37:02] Very few FIND IT.
[1:37:05] VERY FEW CAN WALK THERE.
[1:37:08] IT'S because
[1:37:11] it's a narrow.
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; It's a narrow way.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Not that it cannot contain many.
[1:37:27] We sing a song. There is room.
[1:37:32] And when he set the supper,
[1:37:35] when he he SET THE SUPPER,
[1:37:38] he said, "GO AND CALL THEM
[1:37:41] THAT ARE BEATEN
[1:37:44] TO COME to the WEDDING
[1:37:49] TO COME TO THE SUPPER
[1:37:51] AND THEY COULD NOT COME."
[1:37:54] HE SAID GO
[1:37:56] TO THE STREETS AND BUY
[1:37:59] and call.
[1:38:03] THEY WENT AND CALLED HIM. THE SERANT
[1:38:06] SAID THERE is a room.
[1:38:10] GOD SAID GO BACK.
[1:38:12] SO THERE IS A ROOM
[1:38:14] AT THE FOUNTAIN.
[1:38:17] BUT THE WAY IS NARROW
[1:38:19] MEANING IT IS HARD WAY.
[1:38:23] AMEN.
[1:38:25] &gt;&gt; We are talking about the road map.
[1:38:32] A road map
[1:38:34] in a business,
[1:38:36] it's a strategic PLAN
[1:38:44] in business and projects.
[1:38:47] It's a strategic plan
[1:38:51] THAT DEFINES A GOAL.
[1:38:56] IT DEFINES A DESIRED OUTCOME.
[1:39:02] It includes the major steps,
[1:39:07] MILESTONES
[1:39:10] needed to reach the goal.
[1:39:14] A ROAD MAP IS A HIGH LEVEL STRATEGIC
[1:39:18] PLAN.
[1:39:22] High level,
[1:39:24] STRATEGIC PLAN
[1:39:27] that visually
[1:39:30] represents the goals.
[1:39:35] the major STEPS
[1:39:39] AND TIMELINE
[1:39:42] FOR ACHIEVING A SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE.
[1:39:49] Look brother,
[1:39:50] A VISION ROAD MAP
[1:39:56] IS A COMMUNICATION TOOL.
[1:40:00] It is CREATED
[1:40:03] AND PRESENTED
[1:40:06] TO GET ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS
[1:40:11] and the EXECUTIVES
[1:40:14] and your entire team.
[1:40:17] ALIGN IT ON ONE STRATEGY.
[1:40:22] SO THAT THEY CAN DO THEIR MOST IMPACTFUL
[1:40:25] WORK.
[1:40:28] So that THEY CAN DO
[1:40:31] THEIR MOST IMPACTFUL WORK.
[1:40:37] I WANT YOU TO PUT ON YOUR spiritual
[1:40:39] glasses.
[1:40:41] A road map.
[1:40:44] It's on paper.
[1:40:47] IT'S PHYSICAL.
[1:40:50] IT GIVES YOU THE ENTIRE TRIP.
[1:40:53] THE MAP of the road. NOW
[1:40:57] that the other one was of business and
[1:40:58] PROJECT
[1:41:03] now this one is of the ROAD
[1:41:06] WHICH GIVES YOU THE ENTIRE TRIP.
[1:41:12] It keeps you AWARE
[1:41:15] of your surroundings.
[1:41:20] Amen.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; And the BEST WAY TO TRAVEL
[1:41:25] anywhere
[1:41:27] is to plan ahead.
[1:41:31] Part of planning ahead
[1:41:35] is getting an OVERVIEW
[1:41:40] of your entire trip.
[1:41:45] YOU GET AN OVERVIEW
[1:41:49] of your entire trip.
[1:41:52] THEN YOU SEPARATE THE ROAD MAP BEFORE
[1:41:54] YOU
[1:41:57] AND YOU START TO POINT.
[1:42:00] I'M RIGHT HERE.
[1:42:02] I I I have planned
[1:42:06] that I have to DO SUCH A THING
[1:42:09] ACCORDING TO THE ROAD MAP.
[1:42:12] I CAN DO IT AT THIS CHURCH.
[1:42:15] AND THIS I CAN DO IT HERE.
[1:42:18] AND THIS I CAN DO IT HERE
[1:42:20] UNTIL I REACH MY FINAL DESTINATION.
[1:42:25] I have my road map.
[1:42:31] I WILL HAVE A SUCCESSFUL COURTSHIP
[1:42:35] AND BE ENGAGED.
[1:42:37] I WROTE IT YEARS BACK WHEN I WAS POOR.
[1:42:41] AND IT CAME TO PASS,
[1:42:45] we are talking about a road map,
[1:42:48] BROTHER SISTER. YOU DON'T NEED SOMETHING
[1:42:52] THAT WILL LOSE A SIGNAL.
[1:42:55] You don't need something
[1:42:59] to to guide you along the way that will
[1:43:03] lose a signal.
[1:43:10] That's the wisdom OF MEN.
[1:43:12] WHEN TROUBLES COME,
[1:43:15] WHEN DISCOURAGEMENTS COME,
[1:43:17] WHEN DISAPPOINTMENTS COME, THEY LOSE A
[1:43:20] SIGNAL,
[1:43:22] THEY SHUT DOWN, THEY DON'T HAVE A ROAD
[1:43:25] MAP.
[1:43:29] THIS IS HOW IT WORKS.
[1:43:31] YOU YOU YOU WHEN YOU SPREAD THAT ROAD
[1:43:33] MAP,
[1:43:36] YOU SEARCH,
[1:43:38] YOU FIND WHERE YOU ARE.
[1:43:41] I'm here.
[1:43:44] Where do I WANT TO GO? I WANT TO GO
[1:43:47] HERE.
[1:43:50] OH, I feel
[1:43:53] I look THROUGH
[1:43:57] THE ENTIRE
[1:44:00] I know WHICH WAY IT TURNS THIS WAY.
[1:44:04] WHEN I TURN, WHEN DO I FIND WHERE IS THE
[1:44:08] PETROL STATION?
[1:44:10] WHERE IS THE TRAFFIC? WHERE IS THE
[1:44:13] FOREST? WHERE IS THE LAKE? IT'S IT'S
[1:44:17] IT'S JUST it gives me a full TRIP
[1:44:25] &gt;&gt; and not now.
[1:44:28] You always need a current road map.
[1:44:34] IT HAS GOT TO BE CARRIED
[1:44:37] BECAUSE THE FEATURES
[1:44:39] WHICH WERE HERE 10 YEARS
[1:44:43] and they are not the fishes.
[1:44:47] SO YOU NEED A CURRENT ROAD.
[1:44:51] It will GIVE YOU THE SAME PLACE
[1:44:54] BUT IT SHOWS YOU
[1:44:57] ALL GLORY.
[1:45:00] IT SHOWS YOU WHAT'S AROUND THAT PLACE AT
[1:45:03] THAT TIME
[1:45:10] in that moment.
[1:45:13] as someone I think someone has got to
[1:45:15] cut.
[1:45:17] The road map HAS TO BE A CURRENT ONE
[1:45:20] UP TO DATE
[1:45:23] [Music]
[1:45:28] 1956.
[1:45:29] NOW THIS BLESSED OLD BIBLE
[1:45:34] IS THE ROAD MAP to
[1:45:37] the CRED
[1:45:40] to the grave.
[1:45:42] AND TO HEAVEN ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
[1:45:48] IT SAYS THIS BLESSED HOLY BIBLE
[1:45:52] IS THE ROAD MAP
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; TO THE WHERE WE CAME FROM
[1:45:57] AND TO THE GRAVE
[1:45:59] BACK TO HEAVEN AND ALL THE WAY THROUGH.
[1:46:04] LISTEN THIS BLESSED OLD BIBLE.
[1:46:08] IF YOU HAVE ANY GOAL,
[1:46:12] THERE'S GOT TO BE
[1:46:14] ONE SIMILAR to it
[1:46:17] in the BIBLE
[1:46:24] or else it's it's wrong.
[1:46:30] It will show you THE OUTCOME
[1:46:33] AND THE STEPS YOU NEED.
[1:46:35] SOMEONE HAS got someone may tell me
[1:46:38] Brother Julius, I MAY DESIRE SOMETHING.
[1:46:43] I HAVE NO EXAMPLE of it in the Bible.
[1:46:46] Brother,
[1:46:48] I don't know how you get the scripture.
[1:46:51] IT SAYS ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
[1:46:56] It is covered there.
[1:46:59] I DON'T see anyone that got a job at the
[1:47:01] airport,
[1:47:06] brother. That's not how we do it.
[1:47:10] He says, "AND WE LOVE IT
[1:47:13] BECAUSE THE CONTENTS OF THIS
[1:47:16] IS WHERE WE FIND THE PLAN OF SALVATION
[1:47:20] to serve to the uttermost."
[1:47:24] AND BEFORE WE OPEN IT,
[1:47:27] LET US SPEAK TO THE AUTHOR.
[1:47:30] THE AUTHOR AND HIS WORD
[1:47:33] ARE JUST THE SAME AND THE AUTHOR OF IT
[1:47:37] IS THE REVEALER OF IT.
[1:47:40] Listen brother, YOU NEED THE AUTHOR
[1:47:43] OR YOU APPROACH WHAT HE WROTE.
[1:47:48] You must know the author really well.
[1:47:53] He says it is THE
[1:47:58] ENTIRE PLANET.
[1:48:01] IT JUST GIVES YOU ALL THE TRUTH.
[1:48:05] IN THE BOOK OF JOSHUA CHAPTER 3 verse 1
[1:48:09] TO4 HE SAYS AND JOSHUA WAS EARLY
[1:48:13] IN THE morning and they removed from
[1:48:18] AND CAME TO JORDAN HE AND ALL THE
[1:48:20] CHILDREN OF ISRAEL
[1:48:22] AND LORD THERE BEFORE THEY PASSED OVER
[1:48:26] AND IT CAME TO PASS AFTER THEIR THREE
[1:48:30] DAYS
[1:48:31] THAT THE OFFICERS
[1:48:34] WENT THROUGH THE host
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:37] and they commanded the people listen
[1:48:40] saying
[1:48:44] when YOU SEE THE ARK OF THE COVENANT
[1:48:46] WITH THE LORD
[1:48:50] YOUR GOD AND THE PRIESTS
[1:48:55] BEARING IT
[1:48:57] THEN HE SHALL REMOVE FROM YOUR PLACE
[1:49:00] AND GO AFTER
[1:49:03] YET THERE SHALL BE A SPACE
[1:49:06] BETWEEN YOU AND IT
[1:49:09] ABOUT 2,000
[1:49:12] BY MEASURE.
[1:49:15] COME NOT NEAR UNTO IT
[1:49:18] THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE WAY BY WHICH YOU
[1:49:22] MUST KNOW.
[1:49:24] FOR YE HAVE NOT PASSED THIS WAY.
[1:49:30] YOU HAVE NOT PASSED THIS WAY HERE TOO
[1:49:32] FAR.
[1:49:34] LISTEN BROTHER, HE SAYS WHEN THE TIME TO
[1:49:38] MOVE COMES
[1:49:40] THE IT TAKES THE ARK OF THE COVENANT.
[1:49:44] WHEN you see the LEAR
[1:49:47] AND THE STARTS TO MOVE, HE SAYS YOU
[1:49:51] SHALL FOLLOW THE
[1:49:54] ARK OF THE COVENANT.
[1:49:57] YOU KNOW THE WAY.
[1:49:59] THAT YOU MAY KNOW THE WAY WHICH YOU
[1:50:01] OUGHT TO GO. LISTEN, MY BROTHER, WHEN
[1:50:05] THE JUNCTION OF TIME HAS COME,
[1:50:08] God inspires the pastor.
[1:50:12] GOD INSPIRES THE PASTOR.
[1:50:16] WHEN THE TIME COMES TO CHANGE
[1:50:19] TO MOVE, GOD INSPIRES THE PREACHER.
[1:50:23] AND WHEN THE PREACHER COMES TO THE WORLD
[1:50:26] AND IT IS PREACHING PROSPERITY
[1:50:29] AND IT IS IN MONEY BROTHER AND MOVE
[1:50:36] but the PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THE THE
[1:50:38] PRINCIPLES OF GOD
[1:50:44] THE PREACHER INSPIRES HIM BECAUSE IT IS
[1:50:48] TIME FOR THE CHURCH TO
[1:50:51] REPENTANCE
[1:50:53] TO move to REPENTANCE
[1:50:56] TO REPENTANCE.
[1:50:59] AND THE PREACHER COMES WITH A MESSAGE OF
[1:51:01] REPENTANCE,
[1:51:04] REPENTANCE
[1:51:08] AND
[1:51:11] IT'S NOT TIME TO FORGIVE.
[1:51:14] THE PREACHER WILL COME BEARING THE ARK
[1:51:17] OF THE GOD.
[1:51:19] WHICH HAS THE TESTIMONY OF THE LORD
[1:51:22] WHICH IS THE LIVING WORD OF GOD AND HE
[1:51:25] WILL PREACH FORGIVENESS.
[1:51:27] LET THE CHURCH MOVE
[1:51:30] AND THE BIT OF CLOUD AND A BIT OF FIRE
[1:51:34] MOVE
[1:51:35] BACK
[1:51:38] YOUR
[1:51:40] OUT OF YOUR
[1:51:42] BACK UP EVERYTHING.
[1:51:46] DON'T DISTURB IT WHEN THE AR OF GOD IS
[1:51:51] BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW THE WAY AND YOU
[1:51:55] HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THAT.
[1:51:58] YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN IN THAT TRUTH.
[1:52:00] SO GOD WHO WALKED THE WAY, THE LORD
[1:52:04] JESUS WALKED AND TRIED ALL THE WAY.
[1:52:09] IF I WAS BORN, HE CAME ON THE UPON THE
[1:52:13] EARTH
[1:52:15] AND HE SAW ALL MY BODY
[1:52:18] SAID, "THIS IS MY SON." AND GOD WALKED
[1:52:22] MY BODY.
[1:52:25] GLORY.
[1:52:27] HE WALKED MY PATH.
[1:52:29] HE WORKED MY PATTERNS.
[1:52:32] MY SINS
[1:52:34] PASS THROUGH MY TRIALS.
[1:52:37] AND HE WENT THROUGH AND REACHED THE END.
[1:52:41] THEN HE SAW MY END.
[1:52:44] AND HE SAID, "THE END OF THE RIGHTEOUS
[1:52:47] IS GOD."
[1:52:48] NOW THEN HE COMES
[1:52:51] AFTER YOU ARE BORN
[1:52:55] AND HE SAYS NO MOVE THAT WAY
[1:53:00] but move
[1:53:03] the one TELLING YOU TO MOVE
[1:53:06] AS YOU PASSED THERE BEFORE
[1:53:09] the young men are too heady SOMETIMES
[1:53:13] and women you know
[1:53:16] young men and me
[1:53:19] actually all THE PEOPLE
[1:53:21] SOMEONE will tell them you know I'VE
[1:53:24] BEEN IN THAT
[1:53:26] DON'T GO THAT WAY THEY SAID LET ME GO
[1:53:28] AND I SEE
[1:53:31] OH BROTHER HE SAYS YOU HAVE NEVER PASSED
[1:53:35] THIS way
[1:53:38] the road IS ROUGH
[1:53:41] AND THERE ARE MANY DERS
[1:53:44] SO HE SAYS COME WALK WITH
[1:53:47] COME WALK WITH ME. AND HE SAYS, "COME
[1:53:50] FOLLOW ME."
[1:53:52] LISTEN, BROTHER. MOVE WITH GOD.
[1:53:56] MOVE WHERE YOU LIVE.
[1:53:58] MOVE WITH A SERMON.
[1:54:02] MOVE WITH A SERMON
[1:54:04] BECAUSE IT IS GOD
[1:54:06] DIRECTING THE PRIEST.
[1:54:08] AND HE SAYS HE NOW COME.
[1:54:11] IT'S TIME TO GO TO HIGHER LEVEL.
[1:54:14] IT'S TIME TO POSSESS JESUS. IT HAS GOT
[1:54:16] TO BE THE VOICE
[1:54:20] that says now to possess.
[1:54:25] IT'S TIME TO POSSESS.
[1:54:27] GOD IS PROVIDED WAY OF DEALING WITH SIN.
[1:54:32] HE SAYS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY
[1:54:35] OF DEALING WITH SIN. GOD HAS A WAY. WE
[1:54:39] HAVE A WAY. BUT OUR WAYS ARE NOT GOD'S
[1:54:43] WAYS. AND WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY.
[1:54:48] WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY.
[1:54:51] AND GOD'S THE WAY.
[1:54:53] WE CAN'T BE in our way.
[1:54:59] Yes. WE CAN'T BE IN OUR WAY AND GOD'S
[1:55:02] WAY AT THE SAME TIME.
[1:55:06] JUST LIKE A ROAD MAP.
[1:55:09] WHEN I GET READY TO GO HOME,
[1:55:12] I DON'T SAY, "WELL, now I set a compass
[1:55:20] that perhaps I live directly east
[1:55:27] and north from here."
[1:55:31] Well, if I just TOOK OUT IN THAT
[1:55:33] DIRECTION,
[1:55:36] I WOULDN'T GET OUT OF THE CITY.
[1:55:41] But you know, you get a compass to show
[1:55:43] you east.
[1:55:47] Then you START TO GO EAST.
[1:55:49] LOOK, BROTHER, THERE'S no way over
[1:55:50] there.
[1:55:57] You need a road map to pass.
[1:56:01] Get where THE
[1:56:05] There is been a provided way made for
[1:56:07] me.
[1:56:10] I get A ROAD MAP.
[1:56:13] SEE which road.
[1:56:18] HALLELUJAH. SOMEONE WILL GET IN THE
[1:56:19] MESSAGE.
[1:56:21] IF SOMEONE WOULD COME ANOINTED,
[1:56:24] IF SOMEONE WOULD COME READY TO MOVE,
[1:56:28] IT'S TIME TO MOVE THAT FELLOW WILL MOVE.
[1:56:32] IF HE COMES READY TO RISE,
[1:56:35] THAT WILL RISE
[1:56:37] BECAUSE GOD COMES AND SAYS TURN THIS
[1:56:40] WAY.
[1:56:44] He said see which way the ROAD TURNS.
[1:56:51] IT says I see which way the road turns.
[1:56:56] I see the mark
[1:56:58] where I turn to the left
[1:57:04] and to the right
[1:57:07] and so forth
[1:57:09] and follow that map closely.
[1:57:16] AND I FOLLOW THAT MAP CLOSELY.
[1:57:20] I WILL MAKE MY WAY HOME
[1:57:24] BY the grace of God.
[1:57:26] So he says when I SET TO GO HOME,
[1:57:30] I DON'T JUST SAY IS
[1:57:35] FOLLOW
[1:57:41] EXACTLY. GOD BLESS YOU, BROTHER. I
[1:57:44] FOLLOW IT CLOSELY
[1:57:47] and I will make my way home by the grace
[1:57:50] of God.
[1:57:53] He says WELL WELL
[1:57:56] GOD HAS A MAP.
[1:57:59] HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY
[1:58:02] HAS to go home tomorrow.
[1:58:06] HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY
[1:58:09] FOR SALVATION.
[1:58:11] HE HAS A PROVIDING WAY FOR DIVINE
[1:58:14] HEALING.
[1:58:16] HAS A PROVIDING WAY FOR THE WORLD TO BE
[1:58:21] OPERATED.
[1:58:25] A CHILD OF GOD
[1:58:27] LIVING IN THE WORLD. GOD HAS MADE A WAY
[1:58:30] FOR THEM
[1:58:32] IT
[1:58:34] HOW THEY OUGHT TO OPERATE.
[1:58:38] HE HAS A PROVIDED WAY.
[1:58:41] FOR THE CHURCH
[1:58:44] HAS A PROVIDED WAY
[1:58:46] FOR THE CHURCH.
[1:58:50] THE CHURCH IS TO BE OPERATED
[1:58:55] BY NINE SPIRITUAL GIFTS
[1:58:58] BY THE HOLY SPIRIT
[1:59:01] HAS GIFTS
[1:59:03] AND SIGNS AND WONDERS IN THE CHURCH.
[1:59:08] HALLELUJAH. GOD IS THAT'S GODLY PROVIDED
[1:59:11] WAY
[1:59:14] OF PERFECTING HIS CHURCH.
[1:59:18] LISTEN BROTHER, IT DOESN'T matter
[1:59:22] how many ser
[1:59:25] you listen over to YouTube.
[1:59:29] LISTEN THIS
[1:59:34] WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. YOU WILL NEVER
[1:59:36] BE PERFECTED.
[1:59:40] IF YOU DON'T GIVE ATTENTION
[1:59:43] TO WHAT is preached in your LOCAL
[1:59:49] God is blessed FOR YOU
[1:59:55] where your duty IS
[1:59:58] TO BE PERFECTED.
[2:00:00] EVERYTHING ELSE,
[2:00:02] EVERY OTHER MESSAGE
[2:00:05] IS TRUE. IT ADDS IT TO YOUR PERFECTION.
[2:00:12] I know what I'm talking about.
[2:00:15] I know it brother 100%.
[2:00:19] You will ask it the pastor when
[2:00:22] it's not true. GOD HAS A PROVIDED WAY
[2:00:28] OF PERFECTING his church.
[2:00:31] We try anything else.
[2:00:34] THEOLOGY, THEOLOGY, TEACHING, ANYTHING
[2:00:38] ELSE, IT WILL NEVER WORK.
[2:00:42] YOU CAN HAVE TOO MUCH OF GOD IN THE HEAD
[2:00:46] AND NOTHING OF HIM IN THE HEART.
[2:00:49] I DON'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF HIM IN THE
[2:00:50] HEART,
[2:00:52] TOO MUCH OF HIM IN the head.
[2:00:59] No, I'm saying I would rather have too
[2:01:02] much of HIM IN THE HEART.
[2:01:05] DONE TOO MUCH OF HIM
[2:01:08] because he wants THE HEART.
[2:01:11] NO MATTER THE THEOLOGY,
[2:01:14] THE TEACHING WHATSOEVER,
[2:01:16] IT SAYS IT WILL NEVER WORK.
[2:01:20] IT NEVER DID
[2:01:22] AND IT WILL NEVER DO.
[2:01:24] It never will.
[2:01:27] I know too much of the message.
[2:01:29] I know too much of the Bible.
[2:01:34] BROTHER,
[2:01:36] THAT'S NOT IT.
[2:01:41] IT'S NOT I THAT LIVETH,
[2:01:44] BUT CHRIST THAT LIVETH.
[2:01:47] THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.
[2:01:49] WE GOT TO COME BACK
[2:01:52] TO GOD'S WAY
[2:01:56] to support the church.
[2:02:00] Not making blankets and having super
[2:02:02] suppers,
[2:02:05] BUT EVERY MAN
[2:02:08] PAYING HIS TITHING
[2:02:12] into the church.
[2:02:16] You don't think we are going to open up
[2:02:17] a certain business
[2:02:20] that will make us MONEY
[2:02:24] AND OFFERINGS
[2:02:30] BRING IT TO THE CHURCH
[2:02:32] DOING THE WAY GOD SAID DO
[2:02:38] GOD PROVIDED WAY FOR THAT
[2:02:44] PROVIDED
[2:02:47] FOR A MAN TO COME INTO THE CHURCH
[2:02:52] TODAY. The way we BRING MEN INTO THE
[2:02:54] CHURCH,
[2:02:57] GIVE him a letter,
[2:02:59] bring him into the church,
[2:03:02] the right hand of fellowship
[2:03:06] and sprinkle
[2:03:10] and water
[2:03:12] on top of his head.
[2:03:14] and bring him into that.
[2:03:19] THAT'S NOT WHAT GOD SAID.
[2:03:23] GOD HAS GOT A DIFFERENT WAY
[2:03:27] FROM THAT
[2:03:29] TO BRING THE PEOPLE INTO HIS CHURCH
[2:03:34] BY ONE SPIRIT.
[2:03:37] YOU DON'T say pastor is my friend,
[2:03:40] the minister is my friend.
[2:03:44] Just as friend as friendly can be
[2:03:48] that it
[2:03:51] does not make you part of the church.
[2:03:55] IT MAKES YOU PART OF DVF.
[2:03:59] THAT'S NOT PART OF THE CHURCH
[2:04:02] BY ONE SPIRIT. WE ALL BAPTIZE
[2:04:06] BY THE HOLY SPIRIT. GOD'S PROVIDED WAY
[2:04:11] OF BRINGING MEN
[2:04:15] INTO THE CHURCH BELIEVERS.
[2:04:20] HALLELUJAH. GOD ADDING TO THE CHURCH
[2:04:22] DAILY.
[2:04:25] God adding to the church.
[2:04:32] GOD
[2:04:38] don't do ANYTHING
[2:04:41] JUST
[2:04:49] means it for a purpose.
[2:04:52] THE BIBLE WASN'T PUT HERE
[2:04:57] JUST FOR MAN
[2:04:59] TO JUST look at it.
[2:05:05] SOME OF YOU
[2:05:08] WHEN YOU GET YOUR BIBLE
[2:05:10] START TO OPEN IT THE PAGES ARE STUCK
[2:05:13] TOGETHER.
[2:05:17] CHRISTIAN,

[2:05:24] BROTHER,
[2:05:27] YOU JUST LOOKING AT IT.
[2:05:31] You open
[2:05:33] Jeremiah 28.
[2:05:41] You are in Luke looking for Jeremiah.
[2:05:43] What's the matter with you?
[2:05:46] YOU JUST THE BIBLE WAS NOT PUT HERE JUST
[2:05:49] FOR A MAN TO
[2:05:55] and such brothers and sisters.
[2:06:00] They can cheat each other.
[2:06:05] They are best at arguing.
[2:06:10] EMPTY VESSELS MAKE A LOT OF NOISE
[2:06:16] JUST LOUD CHICK
[2:06:21] ignorant of the scripture.
[2:06:25] IT WAS NOT PUT HERE JUST TO LOOK AT IT
[2:06:31] first about it.
[2:06:34] THE BIBLE WAS PUT HERE
[2:06:37] FOR COLLECTION.
[2:06:40] TO turn that way.
[2:06:43] Fix this. FIX THAT.
[2:06:46] THERE'S A problem there. THERE'S A
[2:06:47] PROBLEM.
[2:06:49] WAKE UP OR RISE FROM
[2:06:52] IT'S A LIFE
[2:06:54] JUST TO BE LATE
[2:06:57] AND IT'S A ROAD MAP
[2:06:59] FROM IMMORTALITY.
[2:07:03] I don't KNOW WHERE YOU HEADING
[2:07:06] WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BIBLE. WHERE DO YOU
[2:07:09] SEE YOUR
[2:07:14] WHERE DO YOU SEE
[2:07:16] FROM
[2:07:20] or you ONLY SEE FROM SINGLE TO MARRIED
[2:07:25] from unemployment to EMPLOY
[2:07:29] from poor to RICH
[2:07:32] WHAT YOU SAYING IS TRUE
[2:07:35] BUT IT IS STILL SHALLOW.
[2:07:39] [Applause]
[2:07:41] YOU HAVE GOT TO SEE THE ENTIRE TRIP.
[2:07:45] THAT'S ALL PART OF THE TRIP.
[2:07:48] BUT THE END OF IT HAS GOT TO BE
[2:07:49] MORTALITY.
[2:07:55] DWELLING IN AN APPROACHABLE LIGHT.
[2:07:58] Dwelling in an approachable light.
[2:08:05] We are talking ABOUT
[2:08:11] it shows you REMEMBER
[2:08:15] all the steps you have got.
[2:08:18] So that all of these STAKEHOLDERS
[2:08:22] must have one who call the stakeholders
[2:08:24] the stakeholders.
[2:08:29] That's that's THIS ROAD MAP.
[2:08:33] WHEN GOD BLESSED MEN HERE,
[2:08:36] THE UNFAILING REALITIES OF THE LIVING
[2:08:39] GOD,
[2:08:42] the unfailing realities
[2:08:47] of the living God.
[2:08:50] When God blessed MANY
[2:08:53] and in the days of the LORD JESUS,
[2:08:57] HE GAVE MEN.

[2:09:19] WHEN GOD BLESSED MEN HERE
[2:09:23] AND IN THE DAYS OF THE LORD JESUS,
[2:09:26] HE GAVE MEN
[2:09:28] THE TRUE ROAD MAP
[2:09:31] TO his power.
[2:09:36] What are you complaining about?
[2:09:39] Whom are you blaming?
[2:09:41] The problem is NOT YOUR WIFE. PROBLEM IS

[2:14:42] and travel it
[2:14:46] and test it
[2:14:49] and TRY IT.
[2:14:51] YOU KNOW where it leads to.
[2:14:59] &gt;&gt; You just KNOW WHEN THE SCRIPTURE SAYS

[2:19:20] ON A WRONG SCRIPTURE

[2:22:46] RIGHT ROAD?"
[2:22:49] HE SAYS, "THE BLOOD FOOTPRINTS
[2:22:55] of the Lord JESUS
[2:22:58] made the road. HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:02] GLORY TO

[2:23:32] HONESTLY CONTENDING
[2:23:35] FOR THE FAITH WHICH WAS ONCE DELIVERED
[2:23:38] TO THE SAINT.

[2:27:07] go unto her.
[2:27:09] Then he says, "And may I help you to
[2:27:12] wash the dishes?"
[2:27:14] He says, "As I'm standing there,
[2:27:16] I'm praying while washing the dishes."

[2:30:51] experience with you.
[2:30:54] I SAID GOD I DON'T HAVE THAT PLACE.
[2:31:00] [Music]
[2:31:06] MY LIFE IS DIFFERENT.
[2:31:09] I KNOW I'M JUST NOT WHAT I USED TO BE.
[2:31:13] I AM JUST EVERYONE SAYS I'M JUST A
[2:31:15] CHRISTIAN.
[2:31:18] BUT LORD,
[2:31:19] I DON'T HAVE that place.
[2:31:23] AND I cleaned the church.
[2:31:26] I said, I'm not eating today.
[2:31:28] I GAVE AWAY THE FOOD.
[2:31:31] AND AFTER CLEANING THE CHURCH, I ENTERED
[2:31:34] THERE AND I locked myself
[2:31:36] AND I SAID, "LORD, WHETHER TODAY
[2:31:39] SATURDAY
[2:31:41] ALL THE SAINTS ARE COMING, I WILL AGAIN
[2:31:43] COME BACK HERE
[2:31:45] AND ANOTHER DAY IF I DIE
[2:31:50] AND EXPERIENCE
[2:31:53] I PUT THE MESSAGE
[2:31:55] ON ALL THE SPEAKERS OF THE CHURCH. WHAT
[2:31:58] IS THE HOLY GHOST? WAS THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:32:02] I RECEIVED THE HOLY GHOST. I GOT THE
[2:32:04] BIBLE. I FIND EVERY
[2:32:08] HOLY GHOST.
[2:32:10] I said, "LORD,
[2:32:13] I
[2:32:17] prayed till I could PRAY NO MORE." AND I
[2:32:21] SLEPT. I SAID, "I think it will be too
[2:32:24] many days,
[2:32:26] BUT I WILL NOT GO."
[2:32:29] AND I WOKE up at around midnight.
[2:32:32] I believe it was God that woke me up.
[2:32:36] AND I KNE DOWN AND I PRAYED again on my
[2:32:40] knees. I prayed and I prayed UNTIL I
[2:32:43] COULD PRAY NO MORE. I SAID, "I'M NOT
[2:32:47] GOING."
[2:32:48] I STARTED TO SING. OH, I LOVE JESUS. OH,
[2:32:52] I LOVE JESUS.
[2:32:54] because he FIRST
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; God is surprised.
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; Oh, PRAISE GOD.
[2:33:06] AND HE CAME AND HE TOOK ME UP.
[2:33:09] THAT WAS NOTHING. THE DEVIL CAN'T TAKE
[2:33:11] it away.
[2:33:14] SOMETHING WITHIN ME TOLD ME.
[2:33:17] NOTHING CAN TAKE THIS AWAY FROM YOU.
[2:33:22] I THINK I'LL TAKE AWAY THAT.
[2:33:25] AND I SAID, GOD, THIS IS WHAT I'VE
[2:33:28] WANTED.
[2:33:30] THIS IS WHAT I READ ABOUT.
[2:33:32] THIS IS WHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE MESSAGE.
[2:33:35] I HAVE GOT it now.
[2:33:38] [Music]
[2:33:40] [Applause]
[2:33:43] GOD WILL SURPRISE THE
[2:33:46] YOU MAY think it will BE TOO MANY TIMES.
[2:33:49] IT WON'T BE TOO MANY DAYS. YOUR
[2:33:52] BREAKTHROUGH WILL COME TODAY. YOU MAY
[2:33:56] THINK IT WILL BE TOO MANY DAYS
[2:33:58] FOR YOUR ANSWER TO COME.
[2:34:01] BUT IT IS TODAY THAT THE ANSWER COMES.
[2:34:05] YOU MAY NOT UNDERSTAND HOW
[2:34:09] surpris
[2:34:12] [Music]
[2:34:20] Oh brother, that man said, "Lord, if you
[2:34:25] don't give me the Holy Ghost,
[2:34:27] you will find my bones in this garden of
[2:34:31] God.
[2:34:34] When you COME BACK
[2:34:36] AND WHEN I MEET THE LORD,
[2:34:40] I DIED BECAUSE YOU DID GIVE ME THE HOLY
[2:34:42] GHOST."
[2:34:45] PROBLEM SAY I WILL eat this portion AND
[2:34:49] PIECE.
[2:34:51] IF I DIE, I WILL TELL GOD I DIED BECAUSE
[2:34:54] I TRUSTED YOU.
[2:34:57] AND JOB SAID THOUGH HE SLAYS ME
[2:35:01] YET WILL I TRUST YOU
[2:35:05] BECAUSE I KNOW
[2:35:07] MY REDEEMER.
[2:35:12] HALLELUJAH.
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[2:35:24] the same yesterday
[2:35:28] IS BOUND
[2:35:30] TO RESPOND JUST THE SAME.
[2:35:33] JUST THE SAME. Just the same. Just the
[2:35:36] same.
[2:35:38] I RESPONDED.
[2:35:40] BROTHER JULIUS,
[2:35:42] &gt;&gt; I HAVE TOILED ALL NIGHT.
[2:35:46] I have applied everywhere.
[2:35:48] I have APPLIED EVERYWHERE.
[2:35:51] I have prayed AND FASTED.
[2:35:54] BUT THERE IS NO CATCH.
[2:35:58] He says launch into the deep.
[2:36:03] AFTER HE PUTS HIS HAND IN THE WATER
[2:36:07] AND THE HAND OF GOD.
[2:36:09] THE HAND OF GOD COME UPON YOU AND
[2:36:12] RECEIVE YOUR ANSWERED PRAYER
[2:36:14] IN THE NAME OF JESUS. YOU SAY MY
[2:36:17] brothers
[2:36:19] are too heavy.
[2:36:21] These bills ARE TOO HEAVY.
[2:36:25] I HAVE A ROAD map that the God we have
[2:36:30] is a Jehovah.
[2:36:32] You say, "Brother,
[2:36:34] I PLEDGE THEE BY INSPIRATION,
[2:36:40] BUT NOW I FEEL IT TOO MUCH.
[2:36:44] OH BROTHER, THE LORD WILL PROVIDE FOR
[2:36:48] HIMSELF
[2:36:52] if it IS OF THE LORD.
[2:36:54] HE PROVIDED FOR HIS OWN
[2:36:56] FROM THAT TIME. HE SAYS THE LORD JESUS
[2:37:00] WHEN HE WAS PREACHING THE GOSPEL UNTO
[2:37:03] THE people
[2:37:05] there came a time John 6 there that he
[2:37:09] laid down the gospel
[2:37:13] in John 6 and they started leaving him
[2:37:18] and because they DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHO
[2:37:20] BROUGHT HIM BACK.
[2:37:23] THE ROAD MAP EXPLAINED ABOUT THE
[2:37:25] MIRACLES.
[2:37:27] They didn't see that it also explained
[2:37:29] THE GOSPEL
[2:37:34] in its entirety.
[2:37:37] IT says they left HIM AND FROM THAT TIME
[2:37:40] HIS POPULARITY
[2:37:42] BEGIN TO decrease it down. He wasn't the
[2:37:47] same one then.
[2:37:50] HE SAYS AND JUST LIKE A modern preacher,
[2:37:56] SOMEBODY
[2:37:59] IF THEY SAY WHY,
[2:38:02] &gt;&gt; wait a minute here, you are offending
[2:38:06] the people
[2:38:09] with your preaching.
[2:38:11] YOU MUST NOT DO THAT.
[2:38:13] NOW A MODERN preacher would say,
[2:38:17] "OH YES, MAYBE I would better watch.
[2:38:20] I would better watch what the CR says.
[2:38:25] I better watch what the company says.
[2:38:28] I better watch what my friends say.
[2:38:33] Maybe I would better look to see what
[2:38:35] the church says about
[2:38:39] turn ME DOWN.
[2:38:42] THE CHURCH MAY TURN YOU DOWN.
[2:38:45] BUT GOD WON'T TURN YOU DOWN.
[2:38:48] THE FRIENDS MAY TURN YOU DOWN.
[2:38:51] BUT GOD WON'T TURN YOU DOWN. THE BOSS
[2:38:54] MAY TURN YOU DOWN. BUT GOD IS YOUR BOSS.
[2:38:58] THAT wasn't our Lord.
[2:39:01] Our Lord came to do the will OF GOD.
[2:39:05] HE FOLLOWED WHAT?
[2:39:07] AND ANYBODY WITH GOD IN HIM
[2:39:11] FOLLOW THE SAME WAY
[2:39:14] THE what
[2:39:16] did did he stop? NO SIR YET HIS
[2:39:20] POPULARITY BECAME ALL THE TIME
[2:39:24] DIDN'T WALK WITH HIM. THEY WENT AWAY
[2:39:27] FROM HIM. THE NEXT CHAPTER SOME TURNED
[2:39:31] NO MORE. They went out from him. He
[2:39:34] says, "WHERE WAS HE AT?
[2:39:37] ON THE ROAD TO CAL
[2:39:40] AND WHERE ARE WE AT ON THE ROAD TO
[2:39:43] GLORY?"
[2:39:47] Many may turn their back
[2:39:50] on the message.
[2:39:52] Say this and do that.
[2:39:54] But brother, I'M STAYING ON THE ROAD.
[2:39:58] I'VE SEEN IT all the way through.
[2:40:01] HE SAYS IT NEVER STOP.
[2:40:05] OR COMPROMISED WITH GOD'S word
[2:40:09] straight on down the highway.
[2:40:12] Now don't sleep. I'm just getting to cut
[2:40:18] just sober
[2:40:21] on THE ROAD MAP.
[2:40:23] THERE WAS A ROAD set before him.
[2:40:26] That's the road you must
[2:40:29] every born again Christian
[2:40:32] as the road set before GOD
[2:40:36] TO follow that road.
[2:40:40] God marks it out.
[2:40:45] It's marked by the BLOOD
[2:40:49] and the spirit ALWAYS
[2:40:52] LIVES IN THE BLOOD.
[2:40:55] BECAUSE THROUGH THE BLOOD
[2:40:58] COMES LIFE
[2:41:00] blood cell is the life
[2:41:04] WE FOLLOW HIM.
[2:41:06] WE SEE how the road map directs us.
[2:41:13] SHOWS WHICH WAY WE ARE GOING.
[2:41:17] It is always been God's provided WAY FOR
[2:41:22] US.
[2:41:26] THE WORD
[2:41:28] IS GOD'S PROVIDED WAY.
[2:41:34] Be it marriage,
[2:41:36] be it a job,
[2:41:38] be it ministry,
[2:41:41] be it family, whatever, whatever,
[2:41:44] WHATEVER.
[2:41:47] This is God is provided me
[2:41:52] the present state of my ministry.
[2:41:56] one of our deacons here.
[2:41:59] I don't know where he is here tonight.
[2:42:02] It's Tony Zabel
[2:42:05] is USUAL AROUND HERE AND HE CAME to me
[2:42:10] and HE SAID HERE NOT LONG ago
[2:42:13] he said I had a dream
[2:42:16] a FUNNY DREAM.
[2:42:19] I dreamt I was trying to find my way
[2:42:21] upward toward heaven.
[2:42:27] HE SAID, "I seen a man coming with a
[2:42:31] black robe on."
[2:42:35] He was reading a book
[2:42:38] and he said, "I got this man."
[2:42:43] And I said TO HIM, "WHICH WAY to
[2:42:46] heaven?"
[2:42:48] AND HE SAID, "ASK THE MAN AHEAD OF ME."
[2:42:54] That was a pastor of a church that he
[2:42:56] had went to.
[2:42:59] He went a LITTLE FURTHER
[2:43:02] AND HE MET another man.
[2:43:05] He had on a black robe
[2:43:09] and he was singing songs
[2:43:11] GOING ON.
[2:43:13] THAT WAS ANOTHER PASTOR.
[2:43:16] IT'S LIKE YOU GOING from church to
[2:43:18] church,
[2:43:21] body to man of God,
[2:43:24] brother to brother, sister,
[2:43:29] BOTH THEM PASTORS ARE PERSONAL FRIENDS
[2:43:31] OF MINE,
[2:43:34] fine men.
[2:43:36] And he said to him,
[2:43:39] which way DO I GET UP TO THE TOP OF
[2:43:41] MOUNTAIN?
[2:43:45] He said, "Look here, standing way up
[2:43:49] there on the top
[2:43:53] that little bitty guy."
[2:43:57] He said, "There stood a guy with a pair
[2:44:00] of overalls,
[2:44:03] wearing a little cowboy hat.
[2:44:08] You think it's about what he wears? You
[2:44:11] think it's about the clothes?
[2:44:15] He says, "There is a guy with a little
[2:44:18] pair of over
[2:44:21] wearing a little cowboy hat."
[2:44:26] Someone said, "That one doesn't look
[2:44:28] like a preacher.
[2:44:30] Looks like a farmer."
[2:44:33] said that it was me standing up there
[2:44:41] and he climbed up
[2:44:45] till he got to me.
[2:44:49] I got him by the arm
[2:44:52] and led him on up till I got on top of
[2:44:56] the hill.
[2:44:59] Listen,
[2:45:01] listen.
[2:45:03] AND THERE WAS A wilderness
[2:45:08] &gt;&gt; to go through.
[2:45:10] That's a place of trials.
[2:45:14] LISTEN. AND I SAID, TONY, I MUST LEAVE
[2:45:20] YOU HERE
[2:45:23] AND YOU MUST WALK SOME OF THIS BY
[2:45:26] YOURSELF.
[2:45:30] TOOK HIS HAND. He took his hand. Took
[2:45:34] him and took him
[2:45:36] up to somewhere.
[2:45:40] He told me this is where I leave you.
[2:45:44] You must walk alone.
[2:45:47] Who are you going to walk with?
[2:45:52] [Music]
[2:45:54] My mother, my father
[2:45:57] and my brother
[2:46:01] and carry me.
[2:46:05] There will be a moment that he will
[2:46:06] leave you somewhere. Not that he wants
[2:46:08] to,
[2:46:10] but there has got TO BE A TIME WHEN YOU
[2:46:13] MUST WALK some of this by YOURSELF
[2:46:19] because God does not keep baby
[2:46:21] Christian.
[2:46:25] HE SAID, "BROTHER, BROTHER,
[2:46:27] WHAT CAN I DO FROM HERE ON?
[2:46:34] WHAT SHOULD I DO?" I SAID,
[2:46:38] COME HERE, TONY.
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; Look down there.
[2:46:43] You see them barefooted tracks
[2:46:48] [Music]
[2:46:49] WITH BLOOD IN THEM.
[2:46:52] I SAID, THAT'S WHAT I HAVE FOLLOWED ALL
[2:46:56] the way.
[2:47:00] Brother is here no more. BROTHER IS NOT
[2:47:02] HERE ANYMORE.
[2:47:04] I WISH THERE SOMEONE WHO could
[2:47:09] you never knew then brother brother
[2:47:12] if you are like that he says JUST LOOK
[2:47:16] OVER THERE
[2:47:18] that's the bloody FOOTPRINTS
[2:47:22] OF THE FACTS OF JESUS
[2:47:25] THAT'S WHAT FOLLOWED ALL
[2:47:32] [Applause]
[2:47:35] THAT'S THE ONLY THING I KNOW
[2:47:38] &gt;&gt; TO POINT man to
[2:47:41] not a
[2:47:43] sensation
[2:47:45] SOME SORT
[2:47:47] BUT TO THOSE BLOOD
[2:47:51] that leads TO THE BIBLE
[2:47:54] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST.
[2:47:56] [Applause]
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Come on brother.
[2:48:04] He says you have got to walk some of
[2:48:05] this.
[2:48:20] WHAT CAN I DO FROM HERE?
[2:48:25] Just look over there.
[2:48:28] Just see the bloody fruit.
[2:48:32] Amen. I wish Paul was young. I wish I
[2:48:36] was in those days.
[2:48:40] I wish my husband did. I wish my wife I
[2:48:43] wish
[2:48:45] I WISH MY FATHER DID NOT DO THAT. I wish
[2:48:48] I was born of a parent. I WISH MY
[2:48:51] PARENTS were rich. I WISH OF MINE HAD a
[2:48:55] job like this
[2:48:59] that's not that's not
[2:49:04] just follow the blood of CHRIST
[2:49:08] when a man comes to a spot brother
[2:49:11] when you just get into contact with HIM
[2:49:16] just somewhere right off there
[2:49:19] anchored in Christ
[2:49:22] God His problem is the Holy Spirit.
[2:49:25] GOD IS PROVIDED OF DOING THINGS.
[2:49:32] It just has got to be God.
[2:49:35] THAT'S THE GOD'S ROAD map
[2:49:39] out
[2:49:41] THAT WILL TAKE YOU up there.
[2:49:44] If Satan
[2:49:46] Satan sometimes
[2:49:48] if he can't make people keep the truth,
[2:49:50] he can't keep them away FROM THE TRUTH.
[2:49:54] HE MAKES THEM FANATICS.
[2:49:56] Throw them off in this side and
[2:50:00] they get all kind of stuff
[2:50:03] and and unscripture THINGS
[2:50:06] BUT STAY ON THE BLUEPRINT.
[2:50:10] STAY ON THE HIGHWAY.
[2:50:12] STAY WITH THE SCRIPTURE.
[2:50:14] DON'T LEAVE IT.
[2:50:17] THAT'S WHY JESUS COME
[2:50:21] not deceived.
[2:50:31] Stay on the highway.
[2:50:34] STAY ON THE ROAD.
[2:50:36] GO THE WAY THE disciples went.
[2:50:40] Go the word they preached.
[2:50:44] Believe it.
[2:50:46] TESTIFY.
[2:50:48] I KNOW IT TO be the truth.
[2:50:51] SIGNS IN THE LAST DAYS.
[2:50:54] GOD living in man.
[2:50:56] It's God is a program.
[2:51:00] GOD HAS TO FIND somebody
[2:51:04] that he can trust.
[2:51:06] SOMEBODY THAT HE CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE IN
[2:51:12] can have confidence IN GOD.
[2:51:16] SOMEONE that can believe him.
[2:51:22] You he says easy is confidence.
[2:51:26] YOU SURE BELIEVE THAT YOU HE SAYS GOD
[2:51:30] HAS TO FIND someone
[2:51:33] whom he can put his
[2:51:37] and when he finds such
[2:51:41] he can PUT HIS CONFIDENCE IN.
[2:51:46] AND HIS POWER
[2:51:48] in that MAN
[2:51:51] THAT WILL FOLLOW THE road
[2:51:55] that will stay on THE MAP
[2:51:59] right on
[2:52:02] till he comes
[2:52:04] to the place of power.
[2:52:09] Not this little bit chicken brother,
[2:52:14] little bitty coward.
[2:52:16] He says someone that can come and follow
[2:52:20] till he comes to the place of power.
[2:52:27] Faith will lead him to that
[2:52:30] BECAUSE HE HAS GOT FAITH IN THE WORD.
[2:52:34] It will relate HIM TO THE PROMISE
[2:52:37] AND IT WILL LEAD HIM TO THE POWER
[2:52:40] AND POWER will lead him to the promise.
[2:52:44] When he gets to the promise
[2:52:47] and he begins to manifest
[2:52:52] the promise,
[2:52:56] what does it do?
[2:52:59] IT BLINDS THE EYES of the unbelieving
[2:53:03] lukewarming
[2:53:04] brother.
[2:53:13] How how has he done it? Probably he's a
[2:53:17] he's a con man.
[2:53:19] He's not a real Christian.
[2:53:22] He's just making himself up.
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; Someone is manifesting THE PROMISE.
[2:53:30] FOLLOWED THE ROAD MAP TILL IT GOT to the
[2:53:32] presence.
[2:53:36] THEY START TO WALK IN THE PROMISE.
[2:53:40] THEY START TO WALK IN THE PROMISE
[2:53:43] and the LUKEWARM
[2:53:50] SERVING BROTHER
[2:53:54] is blinded.
[2:53:59] THAT'S exactly right.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:54:10] &gt;&gt; Oh my my my my
[2:54:12] [Music]
[2:54:15] &gt;&gt; I'm just done over here. Just done.
[2:54:20] It says a man that will follow that law.
[2:54:26] I need the power.
[2:54:28] I need God.
[2:54:30] I need to seek this
[2:54:33] man that will continue in a road map
[2:54:40] will someday
[2:54:43] come to the place of power
[2:54:46] where I will begin to manifest the
[2:54:49] promise.
[2:54:56] JUST KEEP FOLLOWING THE road map.
[2:55:01] Just keep following that road map.
[2:55:04] YOU ARE NOT LOST. YOU ARE NOT ON A WRONG
[2:55:07] PATH.
[2:55:09] YOU ARE just on the right path.
[2:55:14] Brother, brother, brother, sister, if
[2:55:16] you just do what they did,
[2:55:20] just you can just even stand on your
[2:55:22] feet now. We preach together.
[2:55:24] because I've done over here. IF YOU JUST
[2:55:27] FOLLOW EXACTLY WHAT THEY DID,
[2:55:31] he says that's why I think erranous
[2:55:35] [Applause]
[2:55:37] &gt;&gt; that's in the Samaranian church age.
[2:55:40] &gt;&gt; I think erranous
[2:55:43] &gt;&gt; because he had the same faith
[2:55:47] that Paul and the disciples had handed
[2:55:50] down.
[2:55:53] Why I believe
[2:55:56] that he was the ANGEL OF THE CHURCH of
[2:55:58] Samaria?
[2:56:00] Because he had the same scripture
[2:56:03] teachings
[2:56:07] on the basis of God's word.
[2:56:11] It says, it will produce the same thing
[2:56:15] every time.
[2:56:20] Whether it's a young man that takes
[2:56:24] an old man.
[2:56:31] IF THEY FOLLOW JUST right
[2:56:36] that THE OTHER FOLLOWED TO GET THE
[2:56:38] PROMISE,
[2:56:41] it will produce the same thing.
[2:56:45] If you will JUST SIMPLY TAKE GOD'S FILM
[2:56:49] FORMULA
[2:56:51] [Applause]
[2:56:53] I JUST WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS secret
[2:56:57] because we have NOW COME TO AN emergency
[2:57:02] situations which are here.
[2:57:04] The conditions WHICH ARE HERE
[2:57:07] COME WITH A NEED.
[2:57:09] You came with a desire.
[2:57:12] YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
[2:57:14] AND TROUBLE IS UPON YOU.

[3:00:50] We know the road map says
[3:00:53] all things are possible
[3:00:55] to them.
[3:00:58] JESUS SAYS, "I AM THE way which is true
[3:01:03] and it leads to life.
[3:01:06] It's by faith that we do anything.
[3:01:11] What is it, brother? We want to lift UP

[3:01:26] Get yourself out of the way and let the
[3:01:29] Holy Spirit just address you now in the
[3:01:33] name of Jesus Christ. As you said, God,
[3:01:37] touch me now,
[3:01:39] not tomorrow, but today,

[3:03:28] and he gives you something.

[3:03:34] and he gives you something.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; Come on, just lift up.

[3:13:47] them into your hands.
[3:13:49] Father,
[3:13:52] when your servant left,
[3:13:56] the angel of God didn't leave.
[3:13:59] &gt;&gt; He stayed in the flesh. He said he

[3:14:21] come to pass.
[3:14:24] But that they may know that the road
[3:14:28] is marked by God.
[3:14:31] Lord Jesus,
[3:14:36] I commit them into your hearts.
[3:14:39] &gt;&gt; This is your people.

[3:14:44] with your blood.

[3:24:08] Oh, a long life road. I stumbled in the
[3:24:13] darkness.
[3:24:15] My blinded eyes
[3:24:18] had caused my faith to run.
[3:24:23] I made the Lord
[3:24:25] who spoke to me so sweetly.
[3:24:30] Come walk with me and I will see you
[3:24:35] home.
[3:24:37] Come walk with me.
[3:24:40] The way is straight and narrow.
[3:24:44] Come walk with me.
[3:24:48] Cannot walk alone.

[3:24:54] and there are many ders.
[3:24:59] Come walk with me and I will see you
[3:25:03] home.

[3:25:10] savior.
