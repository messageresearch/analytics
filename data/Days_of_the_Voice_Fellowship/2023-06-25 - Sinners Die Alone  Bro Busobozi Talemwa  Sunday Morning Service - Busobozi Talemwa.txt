[Applause] I greet each of you in the precious name of Jesus Christ and I welcome you in this place for Chino so everything we've done it has just been to prepare us for this moment I had a subject the subject I ministered on on Wednesday so I wanted to continue with that this morning but since yesterday since actually a few days ago on my heart trying to find the mind of God for the service this morning you know the way you know the way I know what to speak on every service is I I receive an inspiration um that you can preach on you can take any Scripture literally and you preach yesterday I decided to just take up whatever I had I said I would just continue with this subject of course I wanted to continue with it I titled it the message of the hour I mean Wednesday here and but this morning uh you know I was you know in a place and you know listening to something and right there it came but then I can't remember they said the whole thing and so what I'm going to preach to you this morning came this early morning and I realized I I was deeply moved by it it's the inspiration of God is I pray that you have been in prayer as well and that God will bless you because how many believe that the Lord will speak to them this morning if you're seated let us take John chapter 3 foreign we will read from verses 16 to 22. our interpreter this morning is not um got transport issues and so maybe they'll be coming later today sister praise I'm happy to see you I was praying for you this morning sister praise let us read verses 16. I hope everybody's there if you're there say amen for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life [Music] for God sent his son into the world to into the world to condemn for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved um can you read that again psychology yes so you are the one who is reading it wrong yeah verse 18. give him some little Grace he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten son of God is and this is the condemnation that light is come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil almost for everyone that doeth evil hurts the light neither comes to the light lest his deeds should be reproved so because we shall read last verse 21 but he that doeth truth comes to the light that his deeds may be made manifests a foreign I'd like to take myself out of the way because I realized a gift is a man taking himself out of the way you may use the gifts that the gift may be a blessing to the people and father Lord they can also not hear from you if they don't take themselves out of them the greatest enemy to us is ourselves foreign brother Dixon told me that his cousin will be coming here I think you were his cousin yes so this morning I'm speaking on like I said an unusual subject and I know I've spoken on a subject here and I titled it the Cena's friend Jesus the sinner's friend yes and if you want to listen to that you can go on our podcast on the YouTube channel and you will be able to okay but this morning I want to speak on Cena's die alone [Applause] you know most of my subjects are positive most of my subjects but this sounds negative I don't know how to say it just say it the way you say it brother does not mean that there was God here and there was a sun here we know that when he speaks of the Son of God he's talking of the Flesh of God Jesus was the body and the temple of God yes [Applause] he did not come to the world to be seen a little more sound if you can it is so sad because I don't want to lose a lot of strength it's so sad that in our generation before us so many people have fought Jesus came down to start a religion yes and I think if they're religious let me tell you my friends there is no religion that can take you to heaven as a matter of fact religions there is no place greater than religions are going to do again because the devil wanna see done he shows that people are given this thing in them foreign [Applause] foreign restore the broken relationship before man and God when man sin um the Bible says that they uh the the the reward of sin is death or the penalty of sin is death so when man you know it all means man had to die this means total separations he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a redeemer but he did not give that job to anyone there is no church can save it for our hopeless situation and I want to ask you what is sin he says when God shines in his light are you following me amen maybe we read it later that he came to bear witness of the light and he came to bring Sinners to repentance did they accept him answer me now did they receive him did I believe him they rejected correct that please hallelujah amen whoever he says whosoever for God soul of the world that is gave His only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and then he says for God said not his son into the world to condemn the world oh I say hallelujah to that amen Jesus yes she did not come to the world to condemn the world let me say that again the purpose of the Gospel yeah you are in the image of God you are supposed to be like God foreign God said leave them alone and when the moment was right it is all the angels in heaven did not know what was taking place there is something mysterious about Redemption about salvation of our soul no one can understand how God can save us even today they understand could he let her cry on his feet he was right there yeah do not explain it because saving a sinner is a mystery Jama the devil can't understand it the Angels can't understand the Believers can't understand it the only one that can understand Christ if I tell you that Jesus served me I tell you delivered me from sin you can't understand it but I know because it is an experience I met him I know what happened and I'm not ready to try it for anything no one understood it at that moment that maybe you know like you know what like arms over your body together they're just there in the thickness of the garden and right there and then all the Angels started but in just a moment I want to ask you what happened in heaven there was something that happened God himself God himself he came down yeah Adam had the voice of God and when he had the voice of God he knew his papa I'm asking you this morning this is a very unusual service for me and please stay put foreign no matter which situation you are in seeing songs and at that moment when Adam had the voice of God that moment that is myself regardless of what grave of sin the eyes oh the devil can take you into a grave of science where you think that you can never come out but I want to tell you this morning Jesus came yes God came down in that Garden honey shined his light now you're such a tongue shine his life of Holiness and even Adam could not run away because he didn't want to die alone he didn't want to die amen and Jesus that was only a shadow I say that was only a shadow of what was going to come when God came down was him who saved in the same same way now in the in in 2000 years ago that's not so many years ago did you know two thousand years ago God himself came down to us has been spoken amen you better say Amen because I'm burning up this morning light has shine our generation one more time God has come to us with a power packed message and what does it make us it makes us free men for Christ free men for Jesus Christ this message has set me free for all the Traditions from all the religions you ask me are you Catholic I will tell you no are you angry I would say no yeah because he has already given do I have my brothers and sisters so all religions are welcome here because we are not coming to make an energy for sin is unbelief of the truth when the truth which is the light when it shines and Men reject it they have rejected the light and then you see all these things they do is not Sin City you call it smoking immorality all sorts of immoralities adultery fornication or whatever you want to call it witchcraft hatred [Applause] they do it public because they have refused to walk in the line which for sin is and so the works of the flesh are just fruits of sin it's just sin is reigning in your life someone asked me are you do you mean to say that we all came from Adam and Eve yes there were only one person created and then another one out of here so we all sinned we come to the world you might be a good man and you've never done anything bad and you think you don't need savings sometimes I preach to people you find yourself having hatred when you find yourself you know having variance and and all these things why why because you're born this way the way you were born by sexual desires and that causes you to be a sinner listen children of God I'm not born according to the lust of the flesh foreign Adam was the first one Adam how was he born yesterday by the spoken word Jesus was the second one yes how was he born and we are coming after Jesus hallelujah amen the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God that is but how can you receive Faith you can't receive Faith by going to bars you can't receive Faith you know by doing you know going to all these things that the people go to those people you know you can't receive faith faith comes only one way religion can't bring Faith to you you don't belong in foreign opposite is unbelievable amen and sin is unbelief so people do those bad things The Works of the flesh every color of your movie simply because they don't believe the world but I want to say thank God Jesus is his name yes oh my praise the name of the Lord amen this morning I feel in my heart a lot of love for Jesus hallelujah amen you must love Jesus you should love Jesus yes Jesus was not a Jewish god yes Jesus was not a European God yes not an African god yes Jesus is the god that the real yes all other ways lead to nowhere foreign [Applause] and you don't have to live that way and after Jesus anyone that disbelieves now cannot be actually redeemed yes after Jesus came yes anybody who now disbelieves cannot be redeemed amen it is people die every moment even today even just some of these died Sinners I was studying this I just made a resolution in myself I said oh God let me die a sinner [Music] seeing us die alone and I'll get to that shortly in Hebrews 6 4 Ibraham for the Bible says it is impossible for those if you can read it because it might be difficult for you to read it out of can somebody get a scripture and help him anybody who can help him if you get it for it is impossible Hebrews 6 4 brother put on the screen for it is impossible for those who were once enlightened and have tested of the Heavenly gift and we are made partakers of the Holy Ghost and have tested the good word of God and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew them again unto repentance seeing They Crucified to themselves the Son of God are fresh and put him to an open shame somebody there Hebrews 6 4. no luganda we want Uganda anybody with Uganda Bible listen to that continue six four to six um when Jesus Christ was born yesterday he was born for a purpose and that purpose was that men can be able to repentance can come to repent that those who are walking in darkness we now see a great life so he was the light came in the midst of darkness and now the Bible says he that has been enlightened all you yeah say what I'm saying he that was enlightened enlightened and was that was tested of the Heavenly gifts of the Holy ghosts who is he didn't touch you said I didn't say it was good I said it was all right but after you came to him yes after you you you saw the light from that moment it is a disgrace if you continue to walk in the darkness God gives you the right words with the right strength now I want you to see this when you are enlightened you see you see God doesn't judge you if you kill somebody God doesn't judge you if you you took all the women in the world brother if you took all the women in the world God doesn't judge you if you leave the morally he doesn't judge you for that God doesn't judge you for smoking for getting drunk for having hatred you know these works of the flesh [Applause] when this light of Jesus Shines on your life from that moment you are expected to be different it says if you fall away the Bible says no more of anything for you you can never do it again listen carefully when it is a repentance means that turn around if you are going to Kampala we are in Kampala if you're going to Ginger can they change and they come and tell it is no one will ever find you on Ginger Road from that moment you will be on another road you may not have arrived repentance amen and you find many people saying they have repented of sin repentance is the first thing is to repent okay to change your way when you begin this way of Christ no you will not be perfect but you'll be on your road to Perfection you will never take the other path again are you hearing me this morning now the Bible says repentance let me tell you repentance the Bible says afterwards cannot renew them again brother fine words I mean like look see when because they will be putting Jesus Christ again on the cross the they'll be putting him to the openership are you hearing me church amen Galatians 5 16 says this is I say then walk in a Cubo he has saying to us if we want to live right we've been reading this to my family at the family outer for the past three or four days walk in the spirit Memorial tell your neighbor walk in the spirit Memorial walk in the spirit tell them one more time before we repented we were walking in the flesh we are walking in the spirit we are walking in the spirit we are no longer Walking In the Flesh the Bible says to you who wants to be saved you walk in the spirit Memorial you will not fulfill the last of the flesh so soon the Bible did not say if you walk in the spirit the last of the flesh will go again by keeping yourself on the right path by listening to the World by coming to church by singing when you come by listening to Christian music are not working and I can tell you you will never overcome the things that you were doing when you were in the world [Applause] and I'm preaching to you because if I Don't Preach to you it is my responsibility before God you will require me of what I spoke to you repentance means to change your way repent you cannot repent and continue the way it was acquaintance and things continue normally let me tell you the desire will be there there is a better life [Applause] hallelujah amen walk in the spirit tell your neighbor walk in the spirit for the flesh last against and these are contrary they want to the other so that he cannot do the things that he would be honest but you know the flesh pulls you and you want to know your flesh pulls [Applause] I have come to tell you there is one that can deliver you and I said his name is Jesus manga let me do something weird today when I read one walk of the flesh when summer every walk of the flesh that I read come on you set fire gamble fire how many are ready to do that exercise foreign [Applause] [Applause] foreign and things fire mothers fire drunkenness fire all these things the Bible says that I told you before those that do such things the Bible says those who do those things forget about the net in the Kingdom of Heaven so if you are going to be angry be angry with the Bible not with me why because they are sinners not because they have done bad things it is not these things that will take you there it is John 1 6 the Bible says there was a man sent from God whose name was John is through amen there was that was a true light you are walking in the foreign amen First John 3 8 says he that commits sin but I can't show cast what is sin Achi so he that commits sin is of the devil alcohol for the devil sins from the beginning for this purpose Son of God Manifesto um why was he manifested to redeem sinners why did Jesus come not to make us get organizations how to make pastas that is rubbish for sinners full of souls he didn't come to judge them he came to serve them that he might destroy the works of the Devils does not sin ACH for his seat remains in him and he cannot sin is born of God yes there is no way I can commit adultery because I believe the word the day I commit adultery means I've put Christ again to open chairs our Prophet preached to someone way back and he said people today question he said um a patient laying on a doctor's step when a doctor has medicine for the patient's disease and a patient refuses to take that medicine for his inauguration but the reason he lies is because he refuses let me tell you all of you who are here I'm speaking this on the authority of God's word all of you that are hearing the word this morning you cannot go to hell again you believe what I'm telling you um are you hearing me amen as patient sits on the doors doctor's doorstep but dies there now feel now if he refuses the remedy saying and it's the same thing in the church church now they said right in the view but through Allah today and thy Sinners they die and believersible because there is no remedies that is the people the people's own stubborn Wheels there is plenty of Holy Spirit but it's the people that don't want it let me tell you don't be stubbornness don't have a stubborn Wheels because you will die a sinner who will die an unbelievable but seen us die alone don't accept you too can make that decision amen there are so many people whatever that live wrong in the churches and there have been a hindrance to others who are just believing area don't tell me those things of God because charges are the most sinful blessings don't tell me about churches they're all the same one they decided to go to church when I went again I hear you Again by the time I came out yeah I was the very last full man I said he said the woman who was in the choir with all that the people who believe Jesus who claim to believe Jesus have offended the ones who want to believe in him I saw one church he said from today I forgive my life to Jesus whatever you are doing is okay you don't need to leave them just to give your heart to God yes in a church tell me the conscious of the man take it out to him what a pastor couldn't preach to him foreign all the ambition we have children is to find Jesus Christ ambition is to be a Beacon of Hope in our generation amen that's my only ambition you judge have a right to kick me out amen and any preacher yeah and they take their backsliding they try to justify you with the Bible they are not different from Sinners and seen us die alone he wants to serve you if you are living in a wrong kind of Life forsake that kind of Life forsake that kind of Life throw it away and make your mind up where there is to live according to the word of God amen that is your medicine don't be stubborn second Peter 3 9 it says the Lord is not slack concerning His prophets but is is long suffering to us oh God this is the message of the Cross is about repentance foreign [Music] you're just lying yourself you're deceiving yourself unless you repent of course in the message from that time a red light flashes and he says don't do this little boy it's not easy to go to hell foreign some of you who thought that you will just go to hell easily it is not easy it is easier to go to heaven [Music] this one sounded like a very good pillow it's not easy to go to hell you have to fight your way to help every time you do wrong there is a little red light and the countdown comes together something happens in you but you fight right over here and you hear the people singing the gospel songs you you light up another cigarette and you shake your head what are you trying to do you're fighting your way right through everybody God doesn't send you to hell you send yourself to hell every man that has gone to hell was not sent there by God is so full of love but you never said anyone to him people send themselves break every body they run over everything stop light trying to make yourself to go to hell and then you say God is good and won't send you to hell you are sending yourself to him again God says you can take your Bible with me and read in the Book of Luke chapter 16. as I bring this to our clause Luke 16 verses 19. there was a certain rich man somebody who can read some real good luganda please be ready to read for us there was a sudden rich man which was closed in purple and finally in an unfeared and sorry and feared sumptuously every day and there was a certain beggar named Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores and Desiring uh to be fed with the crumbs which fell from the rich man is stable moreover the dogs came and licked his souls and it came to pass that the beggar died and was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom the rich man also died and was buried and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torments and see if Abraham far off and Lazarus in his bosom and he cried and say father me and send Lazarus that he may deep and cool my time for I am tormented in this Flame and Abraham said Son remember that thou in thy lifetime received thy good things and likewise Lazarus evil things but and now is he is comforted and you are tormented and beside all this between us and you there is a great girl fixed so they which would pass from hands to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from this then he said I pray thee there of our father the Lord send him to my father's house for I have five Brethren that he may justify unto them lest they also come into this place of Torment now Abraham said unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them and he said Father Abraham but if one one went unto them from the dead they will repent and he said unto him if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead very sad story can someone please read for us brother imagine if you're ready if you're not if somebody else can read yeah but Isaac you want to help her no problem from verse 19. 19. can you please put on the microphone for him I want you to listen to this very touching story for me questions [Music] foreign [Music] Alpha nasty today foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign as I bring this to a close I want us to look at this man now I know that some people take this portion of scripture and they try to use it to preach poverty my new world and say that if you were a Believer you know you don't you're not overtaken to get riches because yours is in heaven but you see that a shallow understanding of scripture Jesus was just giving a parable here yes and I want us to understand that this rich man uh is symbolizes a sinner almost the Bible in the Book of Revelation chapter three he speaks of laodice and it says they they think they're they're rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing but they don't know they are wretched they are naked so you see it's the situation of the age I'm requesting you to stay if you really can because I'm just bringing this to a cross and I don't want anybody be this being the end being told of time you find that the devil is ready and wants to power out all his wrath Satan will come foreign we see riches which we see wonderful things let me tell you sin is pleasurable HEB chainuma sin is fun and you cannot be a sin on Earth and seen alone foreign everybody was like oh man this man is really really yeah they call it the babes he has all the babies [Applause] praise the name of the Lord amen today is a weekend to have gone out to enjoy life with many gods and sadly very few have gone with their wives because to them it is let me tell you this man enjoyed life the magic foreign foreign and when they are old and wacky and sucky then they come to God but anyway and then you come when you're 40 50 that you're looking for a a husband and you want to take one of our younger men we will not give them to you you want a younger man a young lady who has served God from their youths you you live the best of your life in the world let me tell you foreign it may seem as though it is not fun Jesus you don't have any hope join usury for having a good life but let me tell you why the life the world gives but short but I will agree with you on one thing it is full of pleasure is if I tell you it has no place that is why some of us yes who forsook that style we call it sacrifice do you think it is normal in the world a young man of my age to be here shouting at you the word of God someday from church there was a better life and I want to tell you this I read from the Bible from the word of God that time is coming each and everyone anybody and the rich man died the Bible says Lazarus Lazaro died and he stops there now come out the next thing we see and he was in the bottom of Abraham
