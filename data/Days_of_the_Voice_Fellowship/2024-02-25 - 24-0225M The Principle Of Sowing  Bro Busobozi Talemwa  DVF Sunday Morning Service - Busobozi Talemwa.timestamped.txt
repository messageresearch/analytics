[1:17:33] service after this
[1:17:36] service and also we have an invitation
[1:17:41] here from speckled
[1:17:45] Ministries they're inviting
[1:17:48] us to go uh for for Easter meetings get
[1:17:54] which will begin on Thursday evening
[1:17:56] 28th
[1:18:00] March and the arrival will be at uh 4
[1:18:04] p.m. on on that
[1:18:09] Thursday and the meetings will go on up
[1:18:11] to uh first April so that is
[1:18:17] Monday and they're saying uh they have
[1:18:20] invited
[1:18:21] speakers
[1:18:24] Brother Joseph
[1:18:26] greenen from the
[1:18:28] USA I actually actually happen to have
[1:18:30] been in touch with
[1:18:33] him Joseph Green has a great burden for
[1:18:35] missionary
[1:18:39] work and I told him I would not be
[1:18:42] around I I know I'm also going to be in
[1:18:44] Switzerland during the same
[1:18:48] time there is other Easter meetings
[1:18:51] there
[1:18:53] so brother Daniel and Brother David
[1:18:55] invited me to go and be a part of
[1:19:00] those so Brother Joseph was telling me
[1:19:02] that one of his uh ministers will be in
[1:19:04] those meetings so I'll meet one of his
[1:19:06] ministers and you will be uh attending
[1:19:09] these meetings where Brother Joseph will
[1:19:10] be
[1:19:13] preaching so then also brother kith raid
[1:19:16] from
[1:19:18] Jama um yeah so basically I think the I
[1:19:23] saw other ministers but uh so they're
[1:19:27] saying that if you are going to
[1:19:30] go uh you should carry personal
[1:19:35] effects including cups plates
[1:19:39] beds
[1:19:42] open and uh the camp will be
[1:19:49] 30,000 uh if you're planning to attend
[1:19:51] those meetings throughout
[1:19:57] there's a c fee to that that would be
[1:20:02] 30,000 the venue isri
[1:20:07] school so Endeavor to be in those
[1:20:11] meetings I was discussing about the
[1:20:13] Martin of course usually when you have
[1:20:16] meetings like this not everybody goes to
[1:20:18] to the
[1:20:21] meetings and
[1:20:23] also uh even when many
[1:20:27] go sometimes you have
[1:20:30] visitors and so we will we will have our
[1:20:34] our we will cancel all the other
[1:20:36] services but we shall have our morning
[1:20:37] noral noral morning
[1:20:42] service that will be let me pick up the
[1:20:50] dates that will be 3 31st
[1:20:55] March so we shall have one service in
[1:20:58] the morning on
[1:21:00] Sunday but the Friday service will be
[1:21:04] cancelled because we believe that
[1:21:06] everybody should be there as
[1:21:09] well and then Saturday everybody should
[1:21:12] be
[1:21:13] there then Sunday
[1:21:16] morning we shall have our normal morning
[1:21:19] service and after that you can again go
[1:21:22] back
[1:21:24] so I believe it will be a wonderful
[1:21:27] time amen during the time as I already
[1:21:29] have informed me informed you I con your
[1:21:36] prayers I'll be a way to
[1:21:40] swizerland and I believe that uh I will
[1:21:44] also be blessed there and my being there
[1:21:45] will also be a
[1:21:51] blessing amen
[1:21:54] uh I appreciate the land contribution uh
[1:22:02] contributions I heard I think the
[1:22:05] brother made a
[1:22:07] mistake said this week we were better
[1:22:09] than last
[1:22:11] week but I think this week we have
[1:22:14] declined a little
[1:22:17] bit I'm looking around for brother
[1:22:21] Andrew do you have the F the treasure do
[1:22:26] F I just wanted to clarify that
[1:22:31] bit
[1:22:34] uh can I can I have
[1:22:42] it so this is this
[1:22:45] week this is last
[1:22:48] week okay the reason I think the reason
[1:22:51] for that is what we announced here on
[1:22:54] Sunday last
[1:22:56] Sunday was less by
[1:23:00] 50,000 and that was because one of the
[1:23:03] groups gave us a wrong
[1:23:08] amount which is why uh team leaders we
[1:23:11] have engaged the new way of reporting
[1:23:14] and using these files which we gave to
[1:23:19] you and so based on that
[1:23:24] I see that this week has been better
[1:23:26] than last
[1:23:29] week but what we announced was a wrong
[1:23:34] amount it was less by
[1:23:38] 50,000 because one one group gave us a
[1:23:41] wrong
[1:23:44] amount so I see many groups have
[1:23:46] declined as much as we have been better
[1:23:48] than last
[1:23:51] week I uh I hope when we do the
[1:23:55] ministers meeting we will meet the
[1:23:56] groups
[1:24:00] shortly leers so that we we can hear
[1:24:05] their problems and their
[1:24:09] concerns we should not
[1:24:11] Tire this is a goal which is is
[1:24:15] attainable and we believe we are going
[1:24:17] to
[1:24:18] attain can I hear your amens if you we
[1:24:22] are going to attain it nothing will
[1:24:25] derail us or stop
[1:24:26] us we are going to pursue it nonetheless
[1:24:30] I appreciate all the
[1:24:33] givers God bless
[1:24:37] you
[1:24:38] amen uh shall we stand on our
[1:24:43] feet I have a a very uh important
[1:24:50] subject to share with with the child
[1:24:54] very important to
[1:24:56] you very important to us as a
[1:24:59] church as
[1:25:01] individuals the approach I may I may
[1:25:03] take
[1:25:07] today not many take that kind of
[1:25:09] approach in the
[1:25:12] message and so bear with me this morning
[1:25:15] and pray for
[1:25:17] me because I feel this is of utmost
[1:25:19] urgency and importance to us
[1:25:24] to learn these
[1:25:26] things and God just gave me a
[1:25:29] confirmation as I was streaming in my
[1:25:32] study as I was streaming this
[1:25:35] morning uh I heard what was the Sunday
[1:25:38] School report can I have
[1:25:42] it brother Prince do you have the Sunday
[1:25:45] School
[1:25:46] report Sunday
[1:25:49] school I I sister Fe came to me last
[1:25:52] night
[1:25:54] told
[1:25:56] me to teaching Sunday
[1:25:59] school and so I connected with brother
[1:26:02] with the
[1:26:04] superintendant and I did not even know
[1:26:06] what she was going to
[1:26:09] speak but I was
[1:26:12] surprised when I heard the
[1:26:17] report I'll give him a moment because it
[1:26:19] is
[1:26:21] important
[1:26:26] thank you
[1:26:28] amen uh the topic
[1:26:32] was reaping what you
[1:26:37] saw I don't know the details
[1:26:40] yet I was not there but I will tell you
[1:26:42] what I'm going to minister on this
[1:26:45] morning I'm going to speak on the
[1:26:47] principle of
[1:26:50] sowing and so in in the Sunday School
[1:26:53] church we did not know what they were
[1:26:55] going to talk
[1:26:57] about but we are in the same
[1:27:00] Spirit God is God is intending to uh to
[1:27:03] speak to us on that
[1:27:07] subject so today we're talking about
[1:27:10] sewing and we're talking about the
[1:27:12] principle of
[1:27:14] sewing you know I I I gave a text
[1:27:17] to uh to brother cosmas now is
[1:27:24] I've never
[1:27:25] heard you will forgive me I've never
[1:27:28] heard of any minister or any believe of
[1:27:30] the
[1:27:32] message I'm just giving a comment I've
[1:27:35] never heard who believes
[1:27:41] that so I asked him a
[1:27:45] question I said
[1:27:49] uh I I said brother cosmas
[1:27:54] do you believe in the principle of SE
[1:27:59] Faith well this is after I had gotten
[1:28:01] the inspiration to speak on
[1:28:04] this where he said I I absolutely
[1:28:08] do it is a Biblical
[1:28:11] principle praise the name of the Lord
[1:28:14] and the reason why I had to read that
[1:28:17] text is because uh this is someone that
[1:28:21] has beli it and experienced
[1:28:26] it and it has
[1:28:28] worked actually he goes on to say it
[1:28:30] brings
[1:28:33] results and so I want I would like if I
[1:28:36] love you as a as as a church as you know
[1:28:39] the people that the Lord has given to be
[1:28:43] Minister and I know something that is
[1:28:45] going to better your
[1:28:47] life I'm going to give it to you now it
[1:28:50] will be up to you to apply it
[1:28:53] this service I'm requesting that you
[1:28:55] really give me your undivided
[1:28:57] attention and you pray for me also that
[1:29:01] the Lord will speak to us
[1:29:03] today shall we just have humble
[1:29:05] ourselves for
[1:29:07] prayer father Lord um many things before
[1:29:11] me
[1:29:12] here the devil has not wanted me to
[1:29:15] speak about
[1:29:16] this for Lord many many
[1:29:20] months at one point months ago I I felt
[1:29:23] aned to speak on this
[1:29:27] subject but I did not know the approach
[1:29:29] to
[1:29:30] you I I I I was still Desiring to hear
[1:29:33] from you and your leadership
[1:29:37] of and father Lord meeting by the cosmas
[1:29:40] it just got St up in me once
[1:29:46] again and going down to study it and
[1:29:50] Desiring to see the word of God about

[1:30:00] your
[1:30:01] word I pray Lord that you will help
[1:30:04] me give me
[1:30:06] inspiration anoint me and also the
[1:30:09] people that are hearing me this morning
[1:30:11] and even many many who might hear this
[1:30:13] later
[1:30:14] on Lord may they not be
[1:30:17] confused but may they be inspired and
[1:30:21] may they receive
[1:30:22] understanding that they will know what
[1:30:24] it is that they ought to
[1:30:26] do to be able to attain your
[1:30:29] promises father give the service to you
[1:30:33] the reading of your
[1:30:34] word give the people inspiration as well
[1:30:36] to
[1:30:38] receive in the precious name of Jesus
[1:30:40] Christ
[1:30:43] amen and uh we are opening 2 Corinthians
[1:30:47] chapter
[1:30:50] 9 uh before I also
[1:30:53] forget uh the the next
[1:30:58] weekend that will be uh the first Sunday
[1:31:03] of
[1:31:06] March the Lord willing we are going to
[1:31:08] have brother Kennedy from
[1:31:13] Nairobi uh going to come and speak for
[1:31:17] us so we we should
[1:31:20] pray that the Lord will will give
[1:31:22] Inspire him to come and bless
[1:31:25] us second Corinthians chapter
[1:31:33] 9 vers
[1:31:36] six and vers s so I have a lot of hair
[1:31:39] on my Fork it may be a little while I
[1:31:42] usually don't want to go beyond 1 hour
[1:31:43] and a
[1:31:47] half but there are certain someons I
[1:31:49] don't want also to break into two parts
[1:31:54] so this is one of
[1:31:56] them if you give me youred
[1:31:59] attention I promise you I won't be
[1:32:02] long so let us read in Jesus
[1:32:06] name but this I say he which sth
[1:32:10] sparingly shall reap also sparingly and
[1:32:12] he also which sth bountifully shall reap
[1:32:14] also
[1:32:15] bountifully every man according as he
[1:32:18] purpose say in his heart so let him give
[1:32:21] not grudgingly or of necessity for God
[1:32:25] loveth a cheerful giver and God is able
[1:32:28] to make all grace abound toward you that
[1:32:30] he always having all sufficiency in all
[1:32:32] things may abound to every good work as
[1:32:34] it is written he has dispersed he has
[1:32:38] dispersed abroad he has given to the
[1:32:41] poor his righteousness remaineth
[1:32:50] forever
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:20] for
[1:33:41] now he that Minister SE to the Ser both
[1:33:44] Minister bread for your food and
[1:33:45] multiply your seed sown and increase the
[1:33:48] fruits of your
[1:33:50] righteousness
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:34:04] so it is him that give gives the
[1:34:07] seed and it is him that multiplies the
[1:34:10] SE or the increase
[1:34:13] thereof and so I want us to remember
[1:34:16] that before we go any
[1:34:19] further it is him God who gives the
[1:34:22] seed and it is him who gives the
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:27] increase but it is you makes a
[1:34:31] decision to
[1:34:35] give God bless you you may have

[1:35:47] him
[1:35:49] amen praise the Lord how many are ready
[1:35:52] to receive
[1:35:54] from H you know you will notice that uh
[1:35:58] of late I've been going a little bit
[1:35:59] deeper to bring some principles to you
[1:36:02] to teach you a little
[1:36:05] bit and so bear with me of course I'm
[1:36:09] not a
[1:36:10] teacher so even when I go to teaching I
[1:36:12] am all over the
[1:36:15] place but God has a way of by the Holy
[1:36:18] Spirit taking out what he wants you to
[1:36:20] hear
[1:36:23] to make the word real to
[1:36:25] you so we are now speaking on the
[1:36:27] principle
[1:36:29] of and certainly the principle of sowing
[1:36:32] and
[1:36:34] repping and so um in the
[1:36:38] message we have not emphasized or spoken
[1:36:42] about
[1:36:44] this not because we do not believe
[1:36:47] it but because it is a
[1:36:50] minor
[1:36:52] and while I
[1:36:53] will go into it before I do that let us
[1:36:57] first read a little bit about what a
[1:36:58] minor
[1:37:03] is in the message Prophet
[1:37:07] 196 he says div Divine Healing is a
[1:37:10] minor in the
[1:37:14] gospel and you can never measure on a
[1:37:18] mind that's why in the message of the
[1:37:20] hour
[1:37:22] we measure on a
[1:37:24] measure the measure is the Salvation of
[1:37:27] the
[1:37:29] soul but you see it's not the only thing
[1:37:32] that is in the
[1:37:34] gospel in the Pentecostal World they
[1:37:38] have measured on a
[1:37:41] minor and what is the minor we'll find
[1:37:44] out he says Divine Healing also is a
[1:37:48] minor it's a bait that is used to get
[1:37:51] people to believe in the Supernatural
[1:38:01] presence the Supernatural is
[1:38:04] present and then by that if they can
[1:38:06] recognize his
[1:38:09] presence then they are
[1:38:11] healed see Listen by
[1:38:14] faith believing it now the Bible says
[1:38:18] without
[1:38:19] faith it is impossible to please
[1:38:22] God you know everything is by
[1:38:25] faith believing by Faith by faith you
[1:38:29] know salvation by faith without faith it
[1:38:33] is impossible to please
[1:38:34] God so everything is really by faith
[1:38:38] even this principle that I'm talking to
[1:38:40] you today
[1:38:41] about it can only be applied in your
[1:38:43] life by
[1:38:45] faith and I want you to remember that as
[1:38:48] well and so he says in the message
[1:38:51] is Faith
[1:38:55] Express now A gift just like I said last
[1:38:59] night a gift is
[1:39:02] wonderful but you can't base your
[1:39:04] Eternal destination on
[1:39:10] gifts please hear me now you cannot Maj
[1:39:14] on a
[1:39:16] minor and a gift is a
[1:39:18] minor and sat can
[1:39:21] any gift that God
[1:39:24] is he can make something just exactly
[1:39:28] like therefore we have got to
[1:39:31] watch all these are
[1:39:33] minor and
[1:39:35] callings you know a man of God with a
[1:39:37] gift of
[1:39:39] healing with a gift of
[1:39:41] vision
[1:39:42] miracles signs and wonders you know
[1:39:46] prophecies all these things are gifts
[1:39:50] and
[1:39:52] minor now not that they but they minor
[1:39:56] they're not the majors I don't
[1:40:01] know yes maybe I don't know you will
[1:40:04] find the right word as we go so you see
[1:40:07] it is a
[1:40:08] minor and uh we talk about
[1:40:11] prosperity and the blessings of God are
[1:40:14] you following
[1:40:15] me it's a
[1:40:17] minor well if you want to learn you you
[1:40:19] you you you say Amen
[1:40:22] so all these things are Min in the
[1:40:24] go it's not the major
[1:40:27] thing in the Bible the major thing in
[1:40:30] the Bible is the Salvation and
[1:40:33] prosperity of the
[1:40:37] soul that is what will take us to
[1:40:40] Heaven if you are not healed you can
[1:40:43] still go to heaven if you are not rich
[1:40:47] you can still go to heaven are you
[1:40:48] hearing me if you have never seen any
[1:40:50] Mir in your
[1:40:52] life as long as you are saved you can
[1:40:55] still go to heaven if you have never
[1:40:57] seen the dead raised you you are saved
[1:41:00] in your soul you will still go to heaven
[1:41:03] you know so in other words all these
[1:41:06] other
[1:41:07] blessings Prosperity signs and wonders
[1:41:11] gifts and calling they are the miners of
[1:41:13] the
[1:41:14] Gospel we do not best on that to go in
[1:41:16] the
[1:41:18] Raptor whether you are poor or Rich you
[1:41:20] will go in the
[1:41:22] as long as you a beli of the word are
[1:41:24] you following me but now because of that
[1:41:28] we have found that in the message we
[1:41:31] have a lot of people living defeated
[1:41:35] lives even here in the church many of us
[1:41:40] struggling struggling
[1:41:42] financially struggling in your marriage
[1:41:46] struggling in your school everything
[1:41:48] about you is struggle
[1:41:52] and you know even when we come to church
[1:41:54] you know we we don't tell you
[1:41:56] how you can break
[1:42:01] out and when anybody tries to tell
[1:42:04] you we fear as preachers we feel that
[1:42:08] when we talk about it other preachers
[1:42:11] will say we are now becoming
[1:42:14] Pentecostal because we are preaching
[1:42:16] Pentecostal
[1:42:18] teaching I don't to be talked about
[1:42:21] I I don't want you to
[1:42:23] struggle I don't want you to live
[1:42:25] defeated life I want to give you
[1:42:28] principles in the word of God will help
[1:42:32] you to prosper in the physical
[1:42:35] things as in the spiritual
[1:42:38] things well of course if you're poor you
[1:42:42] can still go to heaven but I don't want
[1:42:44] to go to a poor
[1:42:47] man in this Bible we read we find one
[1:42:51] man who was rich amen and and he went to
[1:42:56] heaven that is Abraham he was very rich
[1:43:00] because he followed oh
[1:43:02] hallelujah oh God help me to
[1:43:04] teach he followed this
[1:43:08] PR and he was rich and he went to heaven
[1:43:12] and you find another one his name was
[1:43:15] Lazarus he was a Begg he was a poor man
[1:43:18] and he also went to so both of them were
[1:43:21] in heaven one rich one
[1:43:24] poor and then another one went
[1:43:26] to who was actually rich so rich has
[1:43:30] don't take it to
[1:43:31] heaven and when this man was in
[1:43:34] hell he wanted you know some water and
[1:43:38] he looked he looks across the
[1:43:41] dimension and he said I need a little
[1:43:44] more little Qui of my
[1:43:47] sound the sound is okay but that's the
[1:43:50] quality so then he when he looked across
[1:43:53] the
[1:43:54] dimension he said Father Abraham I need
[1:43:59] some
[1:44:02] water he said ah there is a
[1:44:06] big can't you tell
[1:44:10] Lazarus just dip his
[1:44:13] finger in other words he still
[1:44:17] thought he can undermine Laz
[1:44:22] because I think because he
[1:44:27] knew I don't want to be
[1:44:29] remembered as someone who was very
[1:44:32] poor very
[1:44:34] beg even those in
[1:44:41] Hell our Prophet says the way you die is
[1:44:46] the way you'll be
[1:44:47] there nothing changes you just change
[1:44:53] destination that is
[1:44:55] deep that is deep but I'll not take it
[1:44:58] any further I will follow my thought
[1:45:00] here so in other words whether you poor
[1:45:02] or Rich you will go to heaven so if it's
[1:45:06] about going to the
[1:45:07] Rapture just believe the word of the
[1:45:10] hour you will make it amen you will make
[1:45:15] it but today I am not preaching to you
[1:45:18] about going to the rap
[1:45:21] at least for this service today let me
[1:45:24] teach you how to make it in
[1:45:28] life let me teach you how to prosper in
[1:45:32] this
[1:45:33] life whereby you will support the work
[1:45:35] of
[1:45:36] God whereby you will be a head and not
[1:45:39] a whereby you will be a prosperous
[1:45:43] person where you will be called a son a
[1:45:45] daughter of
[1:45:48] prosperity whereby you will give and not
[1:45:52] not not not
[1:45:53] borrow these are all Bible
[1:45:56] principles he says you shall you shall
[1:45:59] borrow but you will not you will not
[1:46:00] Lear you will not
[1:46:03] borrow that's what the Bible says you
[1:46:05] will borrow to the
[1:46:07] Nations my God is this the Bible we
[1:46:11] believe so why is it that especially
[1:46:15] here in
[1:46:16] Africa we pray so much but the more we
[1:46:19] are praying
[1:46:21] the more poor we
[1:46:23] become does it mean the god of the Bible
[1:46:25] does not answer
[1:46:27] us he answers others the problem is only
[1:46:32] one we do not know or teach principle of
[1:46:40] so the
[1:46:42] Pentecostal who teach it so well they
[1:46:45] have become so
[1:46:47] prosperous because the principle works
[1:46:49] for anyone
[1:46:53] no they are
[1:46:55] prospered but they are
[1:46:58] sold is not
[1:47:01] secured but we in the message who have
[1:47:04] secured our
[1:47:06] soul we live defeated
[1:47:09] life so now I want to strike a balance
[1:47:13] today I can bring it to a place where
[1:47:17] you will you will fulfill the
[1:47:19] scripture
[1:47:20] beloved I wish above all things that you
[1:47:24] may
[1:47:25] prosper and be in
[1:47:28] health even as th
[1:47:31] Soul that's the desire of God for
[1:47:35] you God doesn't want you to be
[1:47:38] safe but poor God wants you to be
[1:47:42] happy and also be if let us face it if
[1:47:47] you don't have
[1:47:49] resources in your your family even your
[1:47:52] marriage will be very
[1:47:55] hard life will be very
[1:47:57] hard you look at all those
[1:48:00] sisters they are very happy as long as
[1:48:03] they lubricated very well with
[1:48:08] money families that have more
[1:48:11] money as long as they have
[1:48:14] gold they
[1:48:16] happy I'm talking about Believers
[1:48:18] not because that they have the money but
[1:48:21] they have no joy they have
[1:48:24] no but even when you are Holy Ghost
[1:48:27] F but in the house the wife would say I
[1:48:31] want
[1:48:32] food and and you don't say I don't have
[1:48:34] money and Children Cry that the wife
[1:48:38] will be very
[1:48:40] tough that there will be no joy in the
[1:48:43] house there will be no joy in that
[1:48:46] family because they don't have enough
[1:48:49] resources
[1:48:51] and God does not want you to live like
[1:48:55] that if you don't have school fees you
[1:48:58] will not go to
[1:49:00] school right and you'll be sad all the
[1:49:05] time have gone but have
[1:49:09] not if you don't have school fees and
[1:49:11] they come to chase you even if you begin
[1:49:15] pray I break all the
[1:49:18] spirits of schol
[1:49:20] they will still chase
[1:49:22] you because they need
[1:49:25] money and even if you come and fast and
[1:49:29] pray for the whole day for money you not
[1:49:33] get it how many have F than prayed for
[1:49:36] money and they it never
[1:49:40] came no be honest be yes
[1:49:49] beere
[1:49:50] okay what about those ones when the
[1:49:51] preacher came here he said you can speak
[1:49:55] it and he said I want money
[1:49:58] mil and not come how
[1:50:02] many okay those who have raised and
[1:50:04] those who have been
[1:50:05] shy
[1:50:07] because you did not follow the
[1:50:10] principle praise the name of the Lord
[1:50:13] there is a principle to
[1:50:15] everything and the word of God has all
[1:50:19] answers the has all
[1:50:22] answers and and so we have come to a
[1:50:25] place where we have now as Believers
[1:50:28] completely neglected the
[1:50:34] Min El's Ministry
[1:50:36] remember was to restore all
[1:50:40] things so if if it restor the
[1:50:44] meure amen baptism in Jesus name
[1:50:48] teaching on one God should not
[1:50:51] be you know the order in the
[1:50:54] church and all these teachings about our
[1:50:57] hair that women should not cut their
[1:50:59] hair and men should cut their hair and
[1:51:03] our dressing should be holy and all
[1:51:05] things those are the measur of the
[1:51:08] world and Elijah's Ministry restored
[1:51:12] them also El minist restored all the
[1:51:16] miners of the
[1:51:18] world
[1:51:20] Hallelujah so we must know by the
[1:51:23] message of the hour amen amen to to know
[1:51:27] what the word of
[1:51:29] God actually says and speaks about
[1:51:34] sewing the principle of sowing and
[1:51:37] reaping amen how to become
[1:51:41] prosperous you start a business and in
[1:51:44] three weeks it
[1:51:45] is when everybody's crying economy is
[1:51:48] bad you are a Believer you also crying
[1:51:53] econom that's not right there is a
[1:51:57] problem because we must be
[1:52:00] head when others are crying econom
[1:52:03] is amen we must be
[1:52:05] crying we we don't know what you're
[1:52:07] talking about because we have another
[1:52:10] bank of
[1:52:11] Heaven amen our bank of Heaven amen does
[1:52:15] not require us to Amen to go the way of
[1:52:17] the
[1:52:18] world
[1:52:20] we have another way to be able to become
[1:52:24] prosperous my God are you hearing me now
[1:52:28] are you following me
[1:52:31] now actually the whole
[1:52:34] weekend that brother M was in
[1:52:37] Uganda he was teaching about
[1:52:40] this I don't know whether people
[1:52:42] actually
[1:52:45] got brother the prince came to
[1:52:48] me and he said to me
[1:52:50] I don't know whether people
[1:52:52] understood what he actually was
[1:52:55] saying Believers of the message we just
[1:52:58] love the
[1:53:01] word amen amen bye I'm going
[1:53:06] home when say let us
[1:53:09] give no those are worldly things and I
[1:53:12] don't even have
[1:53:14] money we
[1:53:16] want I don't
[1:53:18] have
[1:53:20] for things I would even stop coming from
[1:53:24] chch because it is putting on pressure
[1:53:27] we have no
[1:53:28] understanding We are failing to prosper
[1:53:32] because we have no understanding of the
[1:53:35] pro of the
[1:53:36] principle of
[1:53:41] sewing whether you like me or not today
[1:53:43] I'm going to
[1:53:45] preach whether you call me Pentecost or
[1:53:48] not today I'm going to preach
[1:53:51] and because it is biblical it is
[1:53:53] scriptural and I want you to
[1:53:57] prosper because the work of God Must Go
[1:54:02] On I don't believe I should be
[1:54:05] beggar I have never believed in
[1:54:08] begging never in all my life I've never
[1:54:12] believed in it even when I had zero
[1:54:15] nothing I've never believed
[1:54:17] in actually I realized
[1:54:20] I was following this principle without
[1:54:23] even knowing it and this has made me
[1:54:26] what I am
[1:54:27] today because it
[1:54:32] works giving and sewing is one other
[1:54:35] Bible
[1:54:38] truth that we should never
[1:54:43] reject in the magean church
[1:54:46] age our Prophet say now this is nothing
[1:54:50] against rich
[1:54:51] [Music]
[1:54:53] people because God can serve a rich
[1:54:56] man some of God's children are
[1:55:00] rich now I want you to separate
[1:55:03] riches and
[1:55:05] prosperity okay I'm not saying that all
[1:55:08] of you should be
[1:55:09] rich not everybody is Rich even the B
[1:55:13] says not many reach are
[1:55:15] called but I'm talking about being
[1:55:19] prosperous in everything you
[1:55:21] do I'm talking about being in a position
[1:55:26] where you've got this where you can take
[1:55:29] care of
[1:55:30] your do you know that even the Bible
[1:55:32] says a man a man who has a home a
[1:55:38] husband a father who cannot take care of
[1:55:40] his
[1:55:41] children he is even worse than an
[1:55:45] Infidel an infid is someone who does not
[1:55:48] believe so which means father if you
[1:55:51] can't take care of your
[1:55:52] home you not even go in the
[1:55:55] rapt that is how it is serious you are
[1:55:59] worse than an
[1:56:00] INF who says that is no God you are
[1:56:04] worse than that so now it means God
[1:56:07] wants you to be in a position where you
[1:56:10] are in control of your
[1:56:12] life where you run your life according
[1:56:15] to the principles of
[1:56:18] God many people want to rely on
[1:56:22] others that's why people do bad things
[1:56:24] in this
[1:56:26] life because everybody wants to rely on
[1:56:28] another
[1:56:29] one and the person giving you money will
[1:56:33] tell you to do things that you don't
[1:56:35] like to do but because of the money
[1:56:37] they're giving you you have a rope on
[1:56:40] your
[1:56:40] neck so you are
[1:56:42] servant even the Bible says that a
[1:56:46] borrower is a slave to the ler
[1:56:50] someone borrows you
[1:56:52] money you become their
[1:56:55] slaves that's why Believers if they
[1:56:58] follow this principle they should not
[1:57:01] borrow they should be able to
[1:57:05] land it's a Bible
[1:57:08] principle according to the word of God I
[1:57:11] have never seen Abraham going to Sodom
[1:57:14] to
[1:57:16] borrow but why does he borrow why do we
[1:57:18] borrow today
[1:57:20] being children of Abraham because we
[1:57:22] don't follow the principle that he
[1:57:25] follow and we do not receive the results
[1:57:28] he
[1:57:30] received so some of God's children are
[1:57:33] rich there are those that are rich but
[1:57:36] even if you are not rich if you follow
[1:57:38] this principle you can never be
[1:57:41] poor if you follow this princi you will
[1:57:45] have enough for you and your
[1:57:48] family enough to give others you have
[1:57:52] enough to support the work of God but
[1:57:55] why are you always
[1:57:57] crying you're always the one who is
[1:57:59] saying you don't
[1:58:00] have because you don't follow this
[1:58:03] princip of
[1:58:06] sowing because money can be a
[1:58:12] snare maybe if a preacher is listening
[1:58:15] to me
[1:58:16] today may like be careful on this
[1:58:21] subject money can be a
[1:58:24] snare some people actually fear
[1:58:28] money people fear
[1:58:32] money God me don't give me
[1:58:34] money I want to stay away from it as as
[1:58:37] I
[1:58:38] can that's your faith receive it
[1:58:41] according to your
[1:58:42] faith it depends on what is in your
[1:58:45] hand and others when they see money they
[1:58:48] Jo for
[1:58:53] and the Sal begins to
[1:58:55] come because to them is their
[1:59:01] God money is paper to
[1:59:06] you it's not what it's not about the
[1:59:09] paper it's about the means to attain
[1:59:13] your purpose in
[1:59:15] life if God tells you you you are going
[1:59:19] to do
[1:59:21] ABCD God must give you the means to do
[1:59:25] it and that means is not what you
[1:59:30] worship what you worship is the god that
[1:59:33] makes it
[1:59:35] possible and listen whoever wants to do
[1:59:39] something for
[1:59:40] God God will give you the
[1:59:43] means let me tell you that means will
[1:59:48] come to you in form of a
[1:59:51] seed and you have to plant that
[1:59:54] seed in order for it to come for and
[1:59:57] bring a lot of
[1:59:59] result but what do we do we eat
[2:00:05] seed that's what we do we eat seed we
[2:00:10] don't care it is difficult this is very
[2:00:13] little how can I give
[2:00:15] it God knows it is enough for me let me
[2:00:19] die at least let me have this and die
[2:00:23] and God says okay that's all you will
[2:00:25] have that's all you will have you've
[2:00:28] eaten your seed you will not Prosper but
[2:00:31] a wise man a wise woman will take his SE
[2:00:35] and plant it in good ground and when you
[2:00:38] plant your seed your seed will germinate
[2:00:41] will spring up and your seed will bring
[2:00:44] forth much
[2:00:46] fruit and he will flourish and prosper
[2:00:53] not many Believers will like me after I
[2:00:55] preach
[2:00:58] this but my real children will love
[2:01:02] me and this thing will work in their
[2:01:07] lives after I preach this and after you
[2:01:10] practice it and you don't get the
[2:01:14] result then I I'm a false prophet and I
[2:01:17] will stop preaching
[2:01:20] but if you practice
[2:01:21] this the whole world will
[2:01:24] see that it is the
[2:01:27] truth not because I preached it because
[2:01:30] the word of
[2:01:32] God but money can be such a
[2:01:36] snare yeah is a snare not only to those
[2:01:39] that who have
[2:01:42] it but also to those who don't have it
[2:01:46] don't say I don't want to get near money
[2:01:49] it will compromise
[2:01:51] me even when you don't have money you
[2:01:54] will be compromised because you don't
[2:01:56] have
[2:01:57] money we have seen people getting into
[2:01:59] big Temptations because they
[2:02:03] poor even preachers many of them can
[2:02:06] tell lies in order to get money even
[2:02:10] preachers many of them can preach a
[2:02:13] first because they are poor but let me
[2:02:16] tell you our Prophet says here money is
[2:02:19] a
[2:02:20] snare not only to those who have it but
[2:02:23] even to those who don't have
[2:02:26] it so it's not about
[2:02:28] money actually John wiy preached about
[2:02:31] money and he said make your friend
[2:02:35] yourselves friends of
[2:02:39] mmon that's what he saying it is a
[2:02:42] scripture in the bible make your friend
[2:02:46] yourself friends of M that even after
[2:02:49] you have
[2:02:51] failed will deliver you into
[2:02:56] Everlasting so it's not about the money
[2:02:59] it's about what money can
[2:03:03] do so to us we are not going to pray oh
[2:03:07] God make me
[2:03:08] Rich we are going to do the
[2:03:11] principle and money will come anyhow and
[2:03:14] when money comes it's not about money
[2:03:17] it's about our purpose
[2:03:23] hallelujah hallelujah proverbs
[2:03:26] 30 vers s and n two things have I
[2:03:30] required of
[2:03:31] thee deny me them not before I
[2:03:36] die these are the words of
[2:03:39] a he says I request you of two
[2:03:43] things oh God don't refuse
[2:03:46] them give them to me one
[2:03:49] remove far from me vanity and
[2:03:53] lies give me neither
[2:03:56] poverty no
[2:03:58] riches feed me with
[2:04:00] food convenient for me lest I be
[2:04:05] full and I deny thee and say who is the
[2:04:09] Lord or lest I be poor and I steal and
[2:04:14] take the name of my God in
[2:04:16] vain so if you poor you are not
[2:04:20] safe some Believers believe they are
[2:04:23] safe as long as they
[2:04:25] poor they will even tell you the Bible
[2:04:27] says it is very
[2:04:30] hard for a rich man inher the kingdom of
[2:04:34] God so now I I don't want to be rich I
[2:04:37] want to be poor if you don't want to be
[2:04:39] rich at least don't pray to be poor
[2:04:43] don't even desire to be
[2:04:44] poor but be desire to be
[2:04:47] prosperous
[2:04:51] 2 Corinthians
[2:04:53] 9:6 but this I say he which s
[2:04:58] sparing shall reap also
[2:05:01] sparing and he which sth

[2:24:43] principle and let us not be weary in
[2:24:46] well dooing
[2:24:48] for in season we shall
[2:24:51] reap F
[2:24:54] not as we have there
[2:24:59] opportunity did you know giving is an
[2:25:04] opportun did you
[2:25:07] know giving is an
[2:25:11] opportunity while I was studying this
[2:25:13] everything like many things became
[2:25:15] clear
[2:25:18] no wonder whenever I give something I'm
[2:25:21] so joyful
[2:25:22] inside because the sleeping is like the
[2:25:24] joy of a
[2:25:26] farmer when he SS and he has bed his SE
[2:25:30] in the
[2:25:31] ground he walks
[2:25:34] away
[2:25:36] expecting he's happy now what I've s
[2:25:40] after six month he could bring me this
[2:25:43] mon he can already begin saying I am
[2:25:46] rich
[2:25:48] I am rich because I've sold I have a
[2:25:51] farm of 50 acres and I have sold
[2:25:56] bountifully I've given much seed I'm
[2:26:00] expecting to reap
[2:26:02] bountifully it's a principle you can
[2:26:05] debate with
[2:26:07] him it will not remove the
[2:26:13] fact so there is no there's no there is
[2:26:15] no room for for you to with me on
[2:26:19] this and this is a sermon the kind of
[2:26:23] sermons I can tell you choose to do it
[2:26:25] or choose not to do
[2:26:28] it because if you don't do it you will
[2:26:30] still go to
[2:26:33] heaven are you hearing me but you will
[2:26:37] suffer
[2:26:38] much in this
[2:26:41] world because you will reap whatever you
[2:26:43] are
[2:26:45] sewing
[2:26:47] and we have there as we have there
[2:26:50] opportunity let us do good unto all
[2:26:55] men especially unto them who are of the
[2:26:58] household of
[2:27:01] faith if you are sowing
[2:27:03] brother so to
[2:27:06] everyone but
[2:27:08] especially the brothers and the
[2:27:11] sisters so to those ones because that
[2:27:15] ground is very good
[2:27:18] it will bring forth much
[2:27:20] increase because that brother will go
[2:27:22] and pray for you whenever you give
[2:27:24] something
[2:27:25] to amen say God bless
[2:27:29] you and God will
[2:27:32] increase you see me by the way I did not
[2:27:36] realize it until this
[2:27:39] morning sometimes I I was doing it
[2:27:43] unconsciously I've realized by way when
[2:27:46] I go back in my life 17 years of
[2:27:50] my I've realized suits has never been a
[2:27:55] problem to
[2:27:56] me but I've realized I've had a
[2:28:00] problem sometimes I want to buy suits
[2:28:04] suit I don't have money to buy
[2:28:07] them I look for the money I can't
[2:28:09] get but I've seen in the past things
[2:28:13] that I was doing
[2:28:14] unconsciously that whenever I took a
[2:28:16] brand new
[2:28:17] suit one of my
[2:28:20] suits I give to
[2:28:22] somebody another Minister brother this
[2:28:26] is
[2:28:29] yours I've realized I just always get
[2:28:33] other new
[2:28:36] suits in ways I never planned or
[2:28:39] imag so I can come here every Sunday
[2:28:42] with
[2:28:43] new I thinking money
[2:28:49] but you don't know where it is coming
[2:28:50] from I was sewing suits to
[2:28:54] somebody and i r amen by way of a
[2:28:59] miracle of myself getting new suits
[2:29:02] getting money I never plan to
[2:29:04] have and without even thinking I buy
[2:29:08] suits how does that happen it doesn't
[2:29:11] happen by
[2:29:12] osmosis it doesn't happen by
[2:29:15] accident so
[2:29:20] you try it and
[2:29:23] see I Dare You
[2:29:25] Church Believers of the message try
[2:29:30] it try it you will see what I'm talking
[2:29:34] about Hallelujah one day I had
[2:29:39] a
[2:29:42] sister sister after I got married you
[2:29:45] know she came to me
[2:29:47] she she told me a lot of issues her
[2:29:49] husband was not helping her and you know
[2:29:52] she was into a lot of trouble she
[2:29:54] couldn't afford you know even
[2:29:56] rent then God gave me Revelation buy and
[2:30:00] build
[2:30:02] house I said God I don't even have a
[2:30:04] house
[2:30:05] myself but it was like a revelation I
[2:30:09] talk to my wife she said if God has told
[2:30:14] you and I did it
[2:30:18] I I bought her
[2:30:21] land and built her a
[2:30:23] house she said
[2:30:30] brother I didn't even have land
[2:30:35] myself not long after that I went to buy
[2:30:38] land land was very
[2:30:41] expensive it is a village but it was
[2:30:44] very expensive in tens of Millions
[2:30:48] and I had only million in my hand
[2:30:52] Hallelujah but i' already given a
[2:30:55] seed and this was unconscious by the
[2:31:00] way but what I did I came I told this
[2:31:04] woman I have only 6 million can can I
[2:31:07] buy pay down payment anday the I think
[2:31:11] it was about 18 or something
[2:31:13] million he said no problem you are a
[2:31:16] pastor are you know I said yes he said I
[2:31:19] know God will do a miracle for
[2:31:21] you I said
[2:31:23] amen and she said you just pay that
[2:31:26] one but she said how many months do you
[2:31:28] give me I said told I told her six
[2:31:30] months and I went away and then there's
[2:31:33] a brother at that time I was still
[2:31:36] living in Ethiopia and you know God
[2:31:39] bless this
[2:31:40] brother our ministry and so he forwarded
[2:31:43] on my
[2:31:45] account
[2:31:48] of about I think three or four
[2:31:51] millions and when I when that money came
[2:31:55] I did not know it was from him but when
[2:31:58] I checked on my account I had about 18
[2:32:01] million I said where did this money come
[2:32:04] from friends before I could ask the bank
[2:32:07] where it came
[2:32:09] from took all that money and paid my
[2:32:13] land and I came back I waited for the
[2:32:17] bank to contact me I was inop at that
[2:32:19] time I was in EOP at that time the bank
[2:32:22] did not contact me after a while I said
[2:32:25] let me contact the bank so I I said what
[2:32:29] happened I received more money than I
[2:32:33] expected they said let us
[2:32:38] check it was an ER in the
[2:32:41] system someone was sending 4
[2:32:45] Millions
[2:32:49] repeating and so that's how it
[2:32:51] accumulated on your
[2:32:52] account he said but I've already used
[2:32:55] it so how will I pay it
[2:32:58] back they said we can consider it as a
[2:33:03] loan and I said but I did not apply for
[2:33:06] the they said no problem there is no
[2:33:10] interest and they said you can depose
[2:33:12] any money you depose we shall take
[2:33:15] it I said for how long they said for as
[2:33:18] long as there is money we shall take no
[2:33:22] problem I got a loan with no interest
[2:33:27] with no time
[2:33:29] period Hallelujah am where did it come
[2:33:32] from it came from the seed I had S
[2:33:35] without even
[2:33:37] knowing God gave me land of my
[2:33:39] own and now I have the
[2:33:42] land until now it is a lot of value now
[2:33:47] [Music]
[2:33:48] friends it's a
[2:33:52] principle if there is any Harvest you
[2:33:54] desire in your
[2:33:57] life find a
[2:33:59] seed that can produce that
[2:34:06] Harvest do you believe this or you
[2:34:10] don't I don't want to have problems with
[2:34:13] my deons after the
[2:34:15] sermon
[2:34:22] if you saw the seed of
[2:34:25] Honor do you know what you're going to
[2:34:33] get if the if you pray and God moves on
[2:34:36] my
[2:34:37] heart I will take several
[2:34:41] Services preaching on one seed and
[2:34:45] harest taking it through the whole
[2:34:47] Bible and showing you people who sold
[2:34:50] amen hor and they ripped
[2:34:55] access and we have many
[2:34:57] Believers even young
[2:35:00] ministers they want to be powerful they
[2:35:03] want to be powerful men of God but they
[2:35:06] have no
[2:35:07] access every door has been
[2:35:10] blocked no one can even let them
[2:35:13] preach and they don't know why
[2:35:16] and do you know what they doing they go
[2:35:18] to fasting and
[2:35:19] prayer Lord open do for me let Pastor
[2:35:24] allow me to
[2:35:25] preach invite me oh God open doors for
[2:35:29] me and God will not open the doors and
[2:35:32] they will go to the doors and they will
[2:35:34] try to push them open those are the ones
[2:35:37] you find in the
[2:35:38] churches fighting the pastor because
[2:35:41] they want to be the pastor now they want
[2:35:43] to be recognized as a preacher don't
[2:35:46] know they have to s a
[2:35:49] seed in order to reap
[2:35:52] access that seed is called
[2:35:59] H when you
[2:36:02] honor man that God has
[2:36:04] used praise God I
[2:36:09] noticed in all my
[2:36:11] life I've dealt with men of God
[2:36:16] I've worked with men of
[2:36:18] God are Way Beyond my
[2:36:23] age all over the
[2:36:25] world all over the
[2:36:28] world and sometimes I wondered how was
[2:36:32] that
[2:36:33] possible and one time there's a man of
[2:36:36] God I did not here in
[2:36:39] Uganda I'll not mention names of course
[2:36:43] and so God directly spoke to me there
[2:36:46] are some people who came to me speaking
[2:36:48] to me negative things about that man
[2:36:50] of and so I was almost about to start
[2:36:54] joining in that
[2:36:56] conversation and the Holy Spirit came to
[2:36:58] me at
[2:36:59] night and spoke to me so in a voice he
[2:37:03] said to me
[2:37:06] respect give honor you mention the name
[2:37:09] of the
[2:37:13] man I didn't even know why but from that
[2:37:16] day without even knowing this
[2:37:18] princi unconsciously because of obeying
[2:37:22] God I humbled myself I honored the man
[2:37:25] of God and from that time I've realized
[2:37:29] that I have no place in my
[2:37:32] heart ever compare myself with any other
[2:37:37] Pastor I honor all
[2:37:41] pastors and this will may surprise some
[2:37:43] of you those in the message and those
[2:37:45] out of
[2:37:47] theage I honor them I respect them do
[2:37:52] you know what that does it gives you
[2:37:55] access it puts you in places that you're
[2:37:59] not supposed to be
[2:38:01] in me
[2:38:04] honoring not
[2:38:06] outside honing from the
[2:38:10] heart you honor the man by the way you
[2:38:13] talk to them by the way you
[2:38:17] them what you do for them you can even
[2:38:21] decide to just take
[2:38:23] something and and say I would like to
[2:38:26] give you this
[2:38:28] Bible and by doing that you are honoring
[2:38:33] him and wait for
[2:38:37] access doors will be
[2:38:40] open does any one of you have open
[2:38:43] closed
[2:38:44] doors
[2:38:46] let me tell
[2:38:47] you you you you will pray you will even
[2:38:51] fast they will remain
[2:38:55] closed maybe you have been praying for
[2:38:57] open
[2:38:58] doors but when you go to office to apply
[2:39:03] for you are not respecting
[2:39:06] anyone you looking down on them because
[2:39:09] you think you are more educated
[2:39:11] than you know you like you are the one
[2:39:14] who does all those kind of fun
[2:39:16] you look down on everybody else that's
[2:39:19] why every door gets closed on
[2:39:22] you nobody wants you it's until you say
[2:39:26] I think I'm
[2:39:27] Beed you are not
[2:39:30] Beed you simply have not sold the right
[2:39:34] seat and there are people you
[2:39:37] find my God God help me to tell there
[2:39:40] are people you find wherever they go
[2:39:44] they are loved immediately
[2:39:47] and you become
[2:39:48] jealous you don't know what you're doing
[2:39:51] you don't know what you're doing let me
[2:39:53] help you those people are doing what
[2:39:56] you're not
[2:39:58] doing people are sowing the right kind
[2:40:00] of
[2:40:01] seeds they hon others they
[2:40:08] them you are the one who comes to the
[2:40:11] pastor and you are the one who will call
[2:40:13] him so all sorts of things
[2:40:16] when a pastor who came and
[2:40:18] said come to the man of God and You
[2:40:22] Begin speaking
[2:40:25] things the one who will call the
[2:40:31] p and you wonder why doors are closed
[2:40:34] for you and you begin saying but
[2:40:37] Pastor loves the other one more
[2:40:40] than there is a problem with you you are
[2:40:43] not showing the right seat
[2:40:46] look at the other people who are
[2:40:49] succeeding in the area where you are
[2:40:51] failing what are they doing that you are
[2:40:53] not
[2:40:54] doing they are so in the right seat how
[2:40:57] are they talking how are they behaving
[2:41:00] if you call a man of
[2:41:02] God he doesn't have to be
[2:41:05] me call them
[2:41:09] them
[2:41:12] Pastor find something
[2:41:17] don't just move as somebody who does not
[2:41:19] know the principles
[2:41:23] of I just give some of you access right

[2:42:14] heard
[2:42:17] but ask yourself a question do you s ti
[2:42:19] do you pay your
[2:42:23] ti you see if you saw prayer and
[2:42:28] fasting what will you get what will you
[2:42:32] get Church you will get a
[2:42:35] Revival there is no other ingredient for
[2:42:37] a
[2:42:40] Revival if we want a Revival in our
[2:42:43] church only SE for that is prayer and
[2:42:48] fasting where you have men and
[2:42:51] women have a personal
[2:42:54] revelation pray and fast for the church
[2:42:57] to pray and fast for the ministry let it
[2:43:00] will bring
[2:43:03] Revival nothing else can do that money
[2:43:07] cannot do it the pastor
[2:43:09] cannot prayer and
[2:43:12] fasting for Revival
[2:43:16] prayer is a seed for
[2:43:18] breakthrough for
[2:43:20] healing those are seeds you have to find
[2:43:23] the right
[2:43:25] seed to
[2:43:27] S to attain the Harvest
[2:43:32] you but it is by
[2:43:34] Revelation showing something that you
[2:43:37] you
[2:43:38] have for something you do not
[2:43:42] have something you desire for God to do
[2:43:44] for you
[2:43:46] in your life what do you do you connect
[2:43:50] it to the right
[2:43:54] seat listen listen Church listen please
[2:43:57] listen I'm going to show you the
[2:44:00] scriptures a
[2:44:03] seed can provoke certain things to
[2:44:05] happen in your
[2:44:13] life did you understand that
[2:44:15] if you that say
[2:44:20] Amen it is only
[2:44:22] God who can tell you what to lay
[2:44:26] down what to sacrifice what to
[2:44:31] give in order to
[2:44:35] activate that law of
[2:44:44] sowing you can provoke certain things in
[2:44:46] your
[2:44:48] life with a
[2:44:55] seed listen we talked about a new phase
[2:44:58] this
[2:45:00] year a
[2:45:03] seed can actually end a
[2:45:08] season in your life and start
[2:45:14] another but I'll tell you something
[2:45:16] which will keep in you in one
[2:45:20] place
[2:45:24] greed what I have is only for
[2:45:28] me not anybody
[2:45:31] else whatever isn't in your life
[2:45:36] yet that is supposed to be
[2:45:39] there you just haven't found out how to
[2:45:42] get
[2:45:44] it
[2:45:45] but God has already given it to you by
[2:45:47] the
[2:45:48] word so this is a law that
[2:45:52] unlocks everything you need in your
[2:45:55] physical
[2:45:57] life you just know how to do
[2:46:00] it here comes a man of God and he comes
[2:46:04] to a woman who has only but
[2:46:08] little she's about to
[2:46:11] die her and her son they a
[2:46:16] little I want you to understand why it
[2:46:18] happened
[2:46:20] that and when a man of God
[2:46:23] comes it seems as if he did not have
[2:46:27] compassion he had compassion but he was
[2:46:31] try oh my God let the church receive
[2:46:34] this he was trying to activate
[2:46:38] something in this woman is
[2:46:41] life because she was about to die anyway
[2:46:45] so he was trying to activate the law of
[2:46:49] sewing and
[2:46:52] harvest so he told her give me to
[2:46:56] [Music]
[2:46:58] eat she said what this is all I
[2:47:02] have and he said I said give me to eat
[2:47:08] first whose decision was
[2:47:11] it the woman's
[2:47:13] decision she had to accept to
[2:47:18] decide to give to S into this man's
[2:47:23] life so that thatw can be
[2:47:28] AC and here the man of God
[2:47:33] emphasizes that's what I've said give me
[2:47:36] first
[2:47:38] to he knew it would activate
[2:47:43] more and the woman
[2:47:46] said but it's all right it's all right I
[2:47:50] will do it I will do it he that sth boun
[2:47:55] free shall reap B
[2:47:57] free are you hearing me she went and
[2:48:00] said I'm going to give it
[2:48:02] all she gave it
[2:48:06] all I said it's all right I'm going to
[2:48:08] die now and when she went
[2:48:13] back
[2:48:23] more did she expect it not a chance but
[2:48:28] how did it happen is the
[2:48:31] LA it's a love giving it's a love
[2:48:35] Harvest harest
[2:48:38] come the right
[2:48:43] way
[2:48:46] do we believe this or we
[2:48:49] don't now this is one of the gospels or
[2:48:52] the
[2:48:54] teachings that you don't only
[2:48:58] believe that's why talked about this in
[2:49:00] the message works is Faith
[2:49:06] expression you do
[2:49:09] something for it to
[2:49:13] be
[2:49:15] Isaac
[2:49:23] tells do you want
[2:49:27] more you want
[2:49:29] more you want
[2:49:33] more to to
[2:49:37] activate the blessing can Pastor are you
[2:49:41] telling us that now you are becom
[2:49:43] Pentecost have to give to
[2:49:45] receive that's the only Bible
[2:49:49] way if you don't give you can never
[2:49:52] receive even the blessings from
[2:49:54] God you will receive
[2:49:57] nothing you always be
[2:50:04] suffering you bless them but

[2:50:14] you today

[2:51:07] apply and then watch for the
[2:51:10] Harvest why why are message believer
[2:51:13] suffering
[2:51:15] God forgive me but God knows
[2:51:17] this I've never seen a sting group like
[2:51:20] the Believers of this Mage in
[2:51:25] Africa especially here in
[2:51:28] Uganda we are very
[2:51:32] Sting If I'm saying the truth help me to
[2:51:34] say
[2:51:36] Amen is it not the truth we are very
[2:51:39] stingy we don't give we don't give to
[2:51:42] the work of God the conventions they
[2:51:46] they said 50,000 40,000,000
[2:51:51] giv let me tell you let me tell you
[2:51:55] Church whenever they say the conv is
[2:51:59] 50,000 the members of dvf don't look for
[2:52:02] 50 look for 100 and saw it in that
[2:52:06] Min right now they invited us for Easter
[2:52:11] meetings whether you're going to sleep
[2:52:13] there or not whether you going to live
[2:52:15] there or not so a big SE
[2:52:18] in yes give it much God reveals it to
[2:52:23] you they said how much is
[2:52:26] it 30 you do give 50 give 100
[2:52:30] give the way you s is the way you shall
[2:52:35] reap we should have that
[2:52:37] Revelation so that the pcal don't go
[2:52:40] higher than us in
[2:52:42] anything if we have this we are much
[2:52:45] higher than
[2:52:46] anyone in Revelation of the word for
[2:52:50] Spiritual and
[2:52:51] physical because our God is a mighty
[2:52:57] God
[2:52:59] Amen but we are the ones who always
[2:53:03] cry they
[2:53:05] callor you said
[2:53:07] 30 that's too much can I
[2:53:13] 5K that you
[2:53:16] poor you don't have
[2:53:18] Revelation so much you
[2:53:25] shall let me show you Genesis
[2:53:29] 27 and it came to pass that when Isaac
[2:53:33] was old and his eyes were de so that he
[2:53:37] could not see he called es his oldest
[2:53:41] son and said unto him
[2:53:45] my
[2:53:46] son and he said unto him behold here I
[2:53:50] and he said behold now I am old and I
[2:53:54] know not the day of my
[2:53:56] death now I pray thee thy
[2:54:01] weapons thy quer and th bow and go out
[2:54:06] to the field and take me some
[2:54:11] vanish hallelujah amen and make me S
[2:54:17] meat such as I
[2:54:19] love and bring it to
[2:54:22] me give it to me bring it to me give it
[2:54:26] to me bring it to me to
[2:54:31] me that I may
[2:54:33] eat that my
[2:54:35] soul may
[2:54:38] bless before I
[2:54:40] die father you're making it difficult
[2:54:45] you just pray
[2:54:46] blessing no my blessing you will get
[2:54:51] after
[2:54:54] sewing God is the same
[2:54:57] way all these blessings are available
[2:55:01] already but you have to S the right
[2:55:06] seat so Isaac told es to bring a
[2:55:10] seed are you saying that if somebody
[2:55:13] else brings a seed will get the same
[2:55:18] blessing just follow the
[2:55:20] principle it doesn't matter who you
[2:55:23] are there is no one there is no one that
[2:55:26] was created for prosperity and another
[2:55:28] one was created for
[2:55:30] poverty I don't care about your
[2:55:33] background in the your family may be so
[2:55:37] poor your family may be so so
[2:55:41] downcast but you can change a face in
[2:55:44] your
[2:55:47] if no one has ever driven in your
[2:55:49] home you can be the
[2:55:54] fast if no one has ever built a house
[2:55:58] you can be the F just follow the
[2:56:03] principle Isaac spoke to
[2:56:06] es but is was just
[2:56:13] there around and
[2:56:16] Rebecca quickly
[2:56:18] came his
[2:56:21] son son I have overheard your
[2:56:25] father going
[2:56:29] to I know what you can do if you saw the
[2:56:32] right kind of your father will give you
[2:56:35] the please
[2:56:39] Rush
[2:56:43] this
[2:56:44] he brought
[2:56:47] it are
[2:56:53] you
[2:56:56] yes the
[2:56:58] voice is of
[2:57:08] Jacob anyway let me
[2:57:12] eat the moment
[2:57:14] accepted
[2:57:18] the the ration is
[2:57:21] there the moment he accepted
[2:57:24] this he did not go back into this
[2:57:28] voice simply said
[2:57:30] iess bless
[2:57:33] you what happened what happened the PRP
[2:57:38] of
[2:57:39] sewing was
[2:57:41] activated hallelujah amen hallelujah
[2:57:44] amen and
[2:57:45] Jacob received the
[2:57:48] blessing instead of
[2:57:51] es I don't care who was meant to be
[2:57:55] blessed someone can say can a man
[2:58:01] God yes with a
[2:58:08] SE dvf members are you still loving me
[2:58:13] am I still
[2:58:15] Pastor yes you can you can make a god do
[2:58:19] things for
[2:58:20] you which will shake
[2:58:23] everybody just with giving the right
[2:58:25] kind
[2:58:25] of just give it to
[2:58:30] God he simply gave and waited when the
[2:58:34] other came said the blessings have
[2:58:36] already
[2:58:39] been but
[2:58:41] wait how did it all start
[2:58:45] the blessing was meant for
[2:58:47] ES but this boy
[2:58:50] jaob always been so
[2:58:52] wise he knew how to snatch the
[2:58:56] blessing he began snatching
[2:59:01] it he so into es
[2:59:05] himself he said what do you want he said
[2:59:09] I
[2:59:10] want I want the spage he said that's all
[2:59:13] you want
[2:59:14] it is all right if I S Portage I want to
[2:59:18] reap your
[2:59:20] birth is that agree he said yes just
[2:59:24] give
[2:59:25] me avoid
[2:59:28] begging avoid
[2:59:30] begging avoid begging people can take
[2:59:34] your bir without you
[2:59:36] knowing the Bible says it is more
[2:59:39] blessed to give than to receive Jacob
[2:59:44] was very wise so he gave the P it seemed
[2:59:48] as if he was receiving nothing when you
[2:59:51] receive a blessing you don't see it
[2:59:53] coming you don't hear it coming you
[2:59:56] don't smell it coming you don't touch it
[2:59:58] coming but when it comes everybody sees
[3:00:03] come hallelujah amen and he received
[3:00:06] that blessing it was an
[3:00:09] exchange thought it was a
[3:00:12] joke but don't
[3:00:16] underestimate the principle
[3:00:21] of in other words whoever SS into your
[3:00:26] life is actually reaping blessings more
[3:00:28] than
[3:00:32] you so you should be
[3:00:35] jealous but you actually deciding to to
[3:00:42] s
[3:00:44] you go to a
[3:00:45] restaurant and you sit down and you
[3:00:48] actually find
[3:00:50] Believers shying away from
[3:00:53] paying when it is time for
[3:00:56] paying
[3:00:59] taking and then they they find is the
[3:01:03] bill

[3:04:49] our land
[3:04:51] fun don't say well I want to be
[3:04:55] humble because if they say I'm the one
[3:04:57] giving the big
[3:04:58] one say I am proud those are poor
[3:05:03] mentality it's a very poor mentality
[3:05:06] give as much as
[3:05:07] you why because you are
[3:05:10] sewing into the ministry
[3:05:14] and if you the right kind
[3:05:15] [Applause]
[3:05:18] of your Harvest
[3:05:26] reaping allow me to go for 30 more
[3:05:30] minutes Psalms

[3:05:38] joy that goth forth and
[3:05:41] weepeth bearing precious
[3:05:45] the condition is not good for you life
[3:05:48] is very hard but there is something that
[3:05:51] you you have a
[3:05:53] SE amen shall doubtless come
[3:05:57] again with
[3:06:00] rejoicing as long as you have a seed and
[3:06:04] you give that seed you will come back
[3:06:07] Rejoice bringing your sh with
[3:06:12] you
[3:06:13] praise the name of the Lord ezel
[3:06:17] 4430 and the first of all the first
[3:06:19] fruits of all
[3:06:21] [Music]
[3:06:24] things there's a brother who told
[3:06:27] me very successful
[3:06:30] man he told me you know what there is
[3:06:33] something Believers don't
[3:06:35] do they don't pay their first
[3:06:41] FRS you get a job
[3:06:43] and your you chew
[3:06:47] it you buy you get a very huge piece of
[3:06:51] land it's all
[3:06:54] yours you sell land all the money is
[3:06:58] needed
[3:07:00] it's but what does the scripture
[3:07:03] say the first of all the first fruits of
[3:07:06] all
[3:07:09] things every
[3:07:12] obl
[3:07:14] of every sort of your
[3:07:17] blessings shall be the
[3:07:22] pr it shall be the priest it will be for
[3:07:24] the
[3:07:27] priest now Pastor now pastor wants money
[3:07:30] for
[3:07:30] [Music]
[3:07:32] us well have not I've given to this
[3:07:35] church more than any of
[3:07:38] you and there's no way that I want money
[3:07:41] from you
[3:07:43] but a priest the priest is supposed to
[3:07:47] reap from the Harvest of the
[3:07:51] people as a matter of fact brother says
[3:07:54] TI is not for building the church it's
[3:07:57] not even for renting the church not for
[3:08:00] helping the widows of the PO TI is for
[3:08:03] the
[3:08:05] minister it is the pastor's
[3:08:09] income and he said now even first
[3:08:12] fruits bring it to the priest there is a
[3:08:15] reason
[3:08:16] why wait for it he shall give unto the
[3:08:21] priest the first of your
[3:08:24] death that he may
[3:08:27] call that he may
[3:08:30] cause that he the priest he may cause
[3:08:34] the blessing to rest in th
[3:08:40] house and you wonder why you have no
[3:08:42] bless
[3:08:45] when you harvest your first crops you
[3:08:47] chew
[3:08:48] it when you get you
[3:08:52] chew everything you chew you chew you
[3:08:55] chew you don't even even when you are
[3:08:58] giving tith you don't give full tithe
[3:09:02] and you expect a blessing you will never
[3:09:05] be
[3:09:06] blessed if you don't give full tith
[3:09:09] don't even bother to give TI at
[3:09:11] all
[3:09:13] give all of
[3:09:15] it that's what the principle says me I
[3:09:19] have been a tith payer ever since it was
[3:09:21] revealed to
[3:09:24] me out of every resources I
[3:09:28] reive I pay my ties I've been paying my
[3:09:32] ties ever since I received this
[3:09:35] Revelation it is not a lot to me the
[3:09:39] Revelation giving is not never
[3:09:41] alone
[3:09:43] Revelation some of you be like H I give
[3:09:47] my money so I can prosper the
[3:09:50] p po
[3:09:52] mentality if you give you are blessed
[3:09:56] more than the one you are
[3:09:58] giving the blessing does not go
[3:10:01] reverse the blessing begins here where
[3:10:05] the giver
[3:10:06] is and the more you give the more you
[3:10:11] receive
[3:10:13] honor the Lord with thy
[3:10:16] substance Proverbs 3:9 and with the
[3:10:19] first
[3:10:21] fruits of all thine
[3:10:26] increase so shall thy B Be
[3:10:32] fill Believers are not saying amen at
[3:10:36] all let me tell you if I were you I
[3:10:38] would be shouting aen and dancing on
[3:10:41] the I am receiving Revelation to come
[3:10:44] out of
[3:10:47] poverty honor the
[3:10:49] Lord don't care how many fear to preach
[3:10:52] this I am going to preach it even if
[3:10:56] they HTE me if you want you can go even
[3:10:59] I am going to say what the word
[3:11:02] says if I remain with 50
[3:11:05] people who are doing it they will
[3:11:08] prosper we will all Prosper the church
[3:11:12] will prosper
[3:11:13] the work of God will
[3:11:14] prosper and even everybody in the
[3:11:17] country will know there is something
[3:11:20] called theti
[3:11:27] message one message Pastor
[3:11:30] recently talked to me and said every
[3:11:33] Ministry has its own
[3:11:37] inclination and he said to
[3:11:41] me that now Robert
[3:11:44] Kay for him his
[3:11:46] inclination and the grace God has placed
[3:11:49] upon is
[3:11:51] prosperity but while I was
[3:11:54] listening I remembered the video I had
[3:11:58] watched I remember the video I had
[3:12:00] watched of Robert
[3:12:02] Kay when he was in America some years
[3:12:05] ago and brother when brother kmas was
[3:12:09] here he mentioned how many remember him
[3:12:11] mentioning about a man called
[3:12:15] um what what's the name of the pastor he
[3:12:17] mentioned how
[3:12:21] many Benson idosa Benson Osa Benson Osa
[3:12:26] is like the father of Pentecostal
[3:12:31] Nigeria very blessed man very wealthy
[3:12:34] man very spiritual
[3:12:36] Ed well of course they never had the
[3:12:38] revelation of the
[3:12:39] message but they had the understanding
[3:12:41] of this principle
[3:12:44] and so now
[3:12:46] B was poor was a
[3:12:48] poor from Africa from Uganda he had
[3:12:52] visited
[3:12:53] America and and when he he was there and
[3:12:57] and and you know he comes in a meeting
[3:13:01] he preaches and this pastor gives him um
[3:13:06] um I don't remember the amount but I
[3:13:07] think some amount on the
[3:13:10] check I think it was either 1,000 or
[3:13:15] and so I think it was
[3:13:17] $1,000 I don't remember and and so this
[3:13:21] BOS came and he started talking how God
[3:13:25] blessed them in
[3:13:28] Niger and if you want to search you can
[3:13:30] search on that man
[3:13:31] is very successful man I believe those
[3:13:35] are the men that even raised up people
[3:13:37] like brother
[3:13:40] cos because brother cosas himself told
[3:13:43] us and that's why I'm sharing this
[3:13:47] testimony because he was with
[3:13:52] Bon and uh he Benson started
[3:13:57] speaking people of course this is where
[3:14:00] Pentecostalism has got it
[3:14:03] wrong he told the people because they
[3:14:06] were doing some fundraising for the
[3:14:07] building
[3:14:09] there and he said we are not poor
[3:14:14] Nigeria and you Pastor you're struggling
[3:14:16] with this
[3:14:17] church I I'll give you people the
[3:14:21] principle that will make them rich and
[3:14:24] will prosper the church so he say to
[3:14:27] everybody he said everyone
[3:14:31] here the doors should be
[3:14:35] locked I said this is where
[3:14:36] Pentecostalism
[3:14:40] goes I don't believe that
[3:14:44] and that everybody
[3:14:45] here should bring um
[3:14:50] $5,000 and is the check that Pastor
[3:14:53] Robert
[3:14:55] had and Pastor Robert started judging
[3:14:57] the man said this man is very
[3:15:01] proud how can he even ask us to no no no
[3:15:04] no no I'm not giving
[3:15:06] anything and he came directly to him
[3:15:08] after a
[3:15:09] while he said
[3:15:14] you are going to give
[3:15:15] $5,000 and quickly a white
[3:15:18] woman came and brought the money to
[3:15:22] brother
[3:15:24] Robert for him to give it because the
[3:15:27] woman the white people thought that
[3:15:28] maybe the black
[3:15:31] man so
[3:15:35] quickly he was also a black man he
[3:15:38] rebuked this white woman he said why do
[3:15:41] you always think you to bail
[3:15:44] us he has to do it
[3:15:47] himself take back your
[3:15:49] money and the woman took back in fear
[3:15:54] and still Robert said this guy is really
[3:15:59] proud how could he rebuke a woman like
[3:16:02] this now we are the only two black
[3:16:04] people here if they arrest us think we
[3:16:08] are committing
[3:16:10] assult long story short eventually he
[3:16:13] gives the
[3:16:15] check and the moment he gave
[3:16:18] it the
[3:16:20] bishop started jumping up and down
[3:16:23] shouting say amen
[3:16:25] hallelujah my friend you are you
[3:16:29] congratulations God has delivered you
[3:16:31] from
[3:16:33] poverty welcome from from
[3:16:37] poverty well of course Robert was still
[3:16:40] saying but now and he will give me back
[3:16:44] my and when they went around after the
[3:16:48] service the man this is his
[3:16:52] testimony Robert said they went out the
[3:16:55] man showed him he opened here a lot of
[3:16:58] money here a lot of money here
[3:17:04] Nigerian I'm not poor my
[3:17:06] friend God has blessed me he said oh no
[3:17:10] you give me back my money he was think
[3:17:13] thinking he would give
[3:17:14] me so he said I see you after the
[3:17:17] service and so after the
[3:17:19] service he went to check in the
[3:17:23] hotel
[3:17:27] told the man stole from
[3:17:30] me all my money
[3:17:33] is but he said even before he
[3:17:36] left long story short that was the
[3:17:39] beginning of his
[3:17:41] prosperity
[3:17:43] now you can debate with Robert
[3:17:47] Kay tell me he's a false
[3:17:49] preacher tell he doesn't know the
[3:17:51] reage and tell him he's not going in the
[3:17:54] because he has not know of our Propet
[3:17:57] and the message
[3:17:58] of you could be right in all those
[3:18:01] things but you cannot win the
[3:18:05] argument in material
[3:18:07] wealth
[3:18:11] hased these are men who started
[3:18:16] Uganda
[3:18:20] churches and they were begging white
[3:18:22] people but he's one of those first
[3:18:25] people and the reason why I gave this
[3:18:27] ton
[3:18:28] publicly because Robert claims that his
[3:18:32] spiritual father is is a te
[3:18:37] Lor we know thator came out of the
[3:18:39] ministry by
[3:18:41] the
[3:18:43] and and and and and their Church they
[3:18:45] were so
[3:18:46] poor but when he received that
[3:18:50] revelation of
[3:18:54] fath people and
[3:18:58] other so friends this principle does not
[3:19:01] apply only to message
[3:19:03] believer it applies to
[3:19:06] anyone who will care to apply it upon
[3:19:10] their h
[3:19:13] and so where was
[3:19:16] I honor the Lord with thy
[3:19:22] substance and the first
[3:19:25] fruits of all your
[3:19:29] increase so shall thy burs be filled
[3:19:34] with and th preses shall burn shall
[3:19:37] shall burst out with new
[3:19:41] wine
[3:19:43] hallelujah hallelujah honor the
[3:19:47] Lord all right I have 15 more minutes
[3:19:49] Listen First Kings
[3:19:51] 34 and the King went to gibon to
[3:19:53] sacrifice
[3:19:55] there I want you to see something
[3:19:58] here what did God give
[3:20:02] Solomon wisdom so if you want wisdom
[3:20:05] what do you
[3:20:08] do give me wisdom Lord in the name of
[3:20:11] Jesus Christ
[3:20:15] me Lord
[3:20:19] understanding how many have S prayed
[3:20:21] such
[3:20:22] prayer let me disappoint you it will
[3:20:25] never be
[3:20:26] answered the more you pray for wisdom
[3:20:28] the more you
[3:20:32] become listen friends there is a
[3:20:36] principle before God gave the man
[3:20:38] wisdom what did he do follow me
[3:20:43] and the King went to gibon to sacrifice
[3:20:47] there for that was the great high
[3:20:53] place
[3:20:55] what listen a thousand bur
[3:21:01] [Music]
[3:21:02] offerings did Solomon offer upon
[3:21:10] that you are not even giving 50
[3:21:15] shs you are saying I don't have anything
[3:21:17] to give but God give me
[3:21:20] wisdom because even the Bible says God
[3:21:24] loves those who have a
[3:21:27] cont is the
[3:21:29] offering my friend it does not work that
[3:21:33] way your offering comes with you in your
[3:21:40] hands I I can say say that
[3:21:42] authoritatively because in this Bible we
[3:21:45] believe there is no one
[3:21:48] person who has ever worshiped
[3:21:51] god without an
[3:21:54] offering find him and I will
[3:21:58] apologize no worship without an
[3:22:01] offering and if you come to church
[3:22:04] without an offering repenting
[3:22:08] today come with an offering prare it on
[3:22:11] Saturday
[3:22:13] don't find the money which is
[3:22:15] teared I will give that
[3:22:17] one you pick the
[3:22:20] smallest that is poor
[3:22:22] mentality God want to prosper you but
[3:22:26] you should have a revelation
[3:22:29] of
[3:22:34] Solomon 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 it must have been
[3:22:40] a work of I don't know how long
[3:22:44] offering after offering offering after
[3:22:48] offering in the Lord appear to Solomon
[3:22:50] in a Dream by
[3:22:53] night after he gave his
[3:22:56] offering God came to him in the somebody
[3:22:59] say hallelujah and God asked ask what I
[3:23:04] shall give
[3:23:07] thee give and he shall receive ask what
[3:23:12] I shall give thee and Solomon said thou
[3:23:16] has showed thy servant David my father
[3:23:18] great
[3:23:20] Mercy according as he walked before thee
[3:23:22] in truth and
[3:23:24] righteousness and in all brightness of
[3:23:26] heart with
[3:23:27] thee and thou has kept for him this
[3:23:29] great
[3:23:31] kindness and thou has given him a son to
[3:23:33] sit on his throne as it is as as it is
[3:23:35] this
[3:23:37] day and now oh Lord my God was this a
[3:23:42] dream
[3:23:44] yes so God comes in
[3:23:46] dreams and you can have a conversation
[3:23:48] with god in a
[3:23:50] dream and now oh Lord my God and some of
[3:23:54] you don't dream
[3:23:55] well because you don't
[3:24:00] succeed you only talk about spiritual
[3:24:02] husband spiritual
[3:24:05] whatever
[3:24:07] nightm so the right seeds my
[3:24:10] friend my God th made thy servant King
[3:24:14] instead of of David my
[3:24:17] father and I am little child I know not
[3:24:21] how to go out or come
[3:24:24] in and th servant is in the midst of th
[3:24:27] people which thou has
[3:24:29] chosen a great people that cannot be
[3:24:31] numbered no counted of a
[3:24:36] multitude give
[3:24:38] there thy servant and understanding
[3:24:40] heart to judge thy people
[3:24:45] that I may Des between good and bad for
[3:24:46] who is able to judge
[3:24:48] this people are
[3:24:56] great are you are you hearing me we
[3:25:00] about to
[3:25:01] reach and the speech please the
[3:25:06] Lord that's it was not a
[3:25:08] prayer it was a speech you just give
[3:25:12] your
[3:25:15] seed because it is not your prayer that
[3:25:18] moves
[3:25:19] God it is your speech that is
[3:25:22] accompanying your
[3:25:28] seed well I will preach it even if you
[3:25:30] don't like me it is the word
[3:25:34] of and God said unto
[3:25:36] him
[3:25:38] because thou has asked this thing
[3:25:42] and has not asked for anything for th
[3:25:44] long for thyself long
[3:25:47] life neither has asked riches
[3:25:50] for nor has as the life of thine
[3:25:54] enemies but but you have asked for
[3:25:56] yourself understanding to design
[3:26:00] judgment
[3:26:01] behold I have done according to Thy
[3:26:05] word Lord I have given the a wise and un
[3:26:09] understanding
[3:26:10] heart
[3:26:13] Hallelujah let me pause there a moment
[3:26:17] when God gave Solomon a
[3:26:20] wise what happened oh my god when God
[3:26:25] gives somebody
[3:26:26] Grace you too can tap from that
[3:26:30] gra how does that happen if you do the
[3:26:33] same thing that he
[3:26:36] did what did Solomon do he gave seed and
[3:26:40] God gave him and understanding what
[3:26:43] happened later people like the woman of
[3:26:47] Ethiopia the queen of
[3:26:49] candes Amen she had of Solomon's
[3:26:52] wisdom and she gathered a lot of
[3:26:55] wealth she gathered gold she got a lot
[3:26:58] of wealth and she went to
[3:27:01] Solomon she wanted to do what to tap
[3:27:04] from the wisdom
[3:27:08] of what did she do she also gave
[3:27:14] and what happened she received what she
[3:27:17] received
[3:27:18] access she received access because she
[3:27:22] HED
[3:27:23] solom by giving the right kind of
[3:27:28] wealth my God this is the principle of
[3:27:30] the
[3:27:32] Bible Hallelujah so that there was n
[3:27:35] like before and God said I'll give you
[3:27:37] wisdom
[3:27:40] understanding and I have also given thee
[3:27:42] that which thou has not
[3:27:48] asked I have also given you what you
[3:27:51] have not
[3:27:54] asked my God I'm having a good time up
[3:27:58] here I've also given you what you have
[3:28:00] not
[3:28:01] asked both
[3:28:04] riches and hor so that there shall be
[3:28:08] not be any among the Kings like unto
[3:28:11] thee all thy
[3:28:15] days and if thou will work in my
[3:28:19] ways to keep my
[3:28:22] statutes and my
[3:28:24] Commandments as th Father David
[3:28:27] did then I will lengthen your
[3:28:31] days that's why all the rich brothers
[3:28:33] and
[3:28:35] sisters they themselves the more God
[3:28:39] makes you bigger the more you humble
[3:28:42] yourself because you know it has nothing
[3:28:45] to do with your hard
[3:28:47] work it is God is Grace and
[3:28:51] blessings and the more you humble
[3:28:53] yourself the more God adds on
[3:28:56] you think Solomon just came across and
[3:28:58] asked for wisdom and
[3:29:01] understand so we have people who pray
[3:29:03] for the
[3:29:05] same there is a
[3:29:07] principle what have you sold
[3:29:10] for
[3:29:13] what have you sold for it if you give
[3:29:15] arms to the
[3:29:18] poor God has promised in Proverbs
[3:29:23] 1917 he will repay
[3:29:26] you and when God repays you God repays
[3:29:29] you
[3:29:31] handsomely 10

[3:44:00] want if you want a big
[3:44:06] blessing saw a big SE
[3:44:11] Pastor now you're talking like a real
[3:44:14] pentec yes it's a Bible
[3:44:19] principle and I'll finish with a
[3:44:22] testimony of a man called
[3:44:25] joh I have the quot here but because of
[3:44:28] time I not read it but if you want it it
[3:44:31] is in many
[3:44:32] messages but in faith without works is
[3:44:37] dead brother bam actually preaches this
[3:44:39] same
[3:44:41] teaching through the
[3:44:44] testimony exactly the same
[3:44:46] teaching he said John Char was a man
[3:44:50] that was poor from a poor
[3:44:53] background and they were selling apples
[3:44:56] and
[3:44:57] ni they didn't have much and then this
[3:45:01] man was married he was looking for a
[3:45:03] wife and then God gave him a
[3:45:05] wife and then God did not give them
[3:45:08] children so were baren so he's married
[3:45:13] bar and
[3:45:15] poor that's the situation of many
[3:45:21] believer but there is something he
[3:45:24] did that turned around his
[3:45:29] life
[3:45:31] forever that every believer loves to
[3:45:33] talk
[3:45:34] about don't want to do what he
[3:45:38] did this man
[3:45:41] was beating on the roads making trying
[3:45:43] to make money with his
[3:45:48] wife and they made some money and so
[3:45:51] they built a house for themselves after
[3:45:53] many years of
[3:45:55] suffer and after buying that
[3:45:58] house they moved in they were lovely and
[3:46:03] happy and while the man
[3:46:08] slept God came to him in a
[3:46:11] dream and they told
[3:46:13] him John
[3:46:15] Char pick some of your
[3:46:18] clothes and some of specifically told
[3:46:21] him the belonging to
[3:46:24] Pi this
[3:46:27] house there is a man of God my
[3:46:30] man who is I don't remember the name of
[3:46:32] the man
[3:46:34] Dr Dr sat is coming into this
[3:46:38] city he going to to hold a
[3:46:40] Revival so give brother
[3:46:43] Saturn that
[3:46:45] house praise the name of the Lord and he
[3:46:48] said give it to him just like that so
[3:46:52] the man came out of the dream and he
[3:46:54] came to his wife he said darling wife
[3:46:58] God visited me in the
[3:46:59] night and told me I should give we
[3:47:03] should pack our
[3:47:07] clothes we should leave everything the
[3:47:09] way
[3:47:11] but take only our
[3:47:16] cloes who
[3:47:24] agree sisters think about
[3:47:26] it if your husband told you like
[3:47:29] that would you
[3:47:31] agree what what about the
[3:47:34] children God cannot give you a
[3:47:38] trial that is more heavy than
[3:47:40] you that's the reason why he had not
[3:47:42] given them children
[3:47:45] yet CU he had to test them and he didn't
[3:47:49] want children to suffer so he had to
[3:47:52] test them in order for them to get a
[3:47:54] bigger blessing so when they get
[3:47:56] children children will be more
[3:48:00] comfortable God wants your children to
[3:48:01] be
[3:48:03] comfortable if you have children and you
[3:48:06] don't have the blessings take care of
[3:48:08] them check area of
[3:48:13] sewing and the sister said my darling
[3:48:17] husband God spoke to you it is all right
[3:48:21] we will do just what he said so they
[3:48:23] packed up their
[3:48:25] bags and left the
[3:48:29] house and told Dr
[3:48:31] Saturn Saturn this is now your
[3:48:35] house no you must take
[3:48:38] it it is your
[3:48:41] house he said all right he took it the
[3:48:46] moment he received
[3:48:47] it it was a seed
[3:48:51] planted to give his an
[3:48:55] opportunity you must force your receiver
[3:48:58] to
[3:49:01] receive that's why this white brothers
[3:49:03] in
[3:49:07] America the Africans beg
[3:49:10] them and they know some of them are
[3:49:12] deceiving
[3:49:13] them but they still
[3:49:15] give they an
[3:49:18] opportunity to get more
[3:49:21] wealth and the Africans think should beg
[3:49:25] more that's a poor
[3:49:28] mindset we should not beg we should do
[3:49:31] what they do we should give we should
[3:49:35] give I am aie of
[3:49:38] that
[3:49:40] all and try and see
[3:49:43] what and John Char and his wife left the
[3:49:48] house they went back to the
[3:49:52] stones after a few years after little
[3:49:55] while God brought a millionaire
[3:49:58] woman talk to John Char said you look
[3:50:02] like a good man I've been
[3:50:05] sing I can give you a place to leave if
[3:50:07] you don't have a place to leave
[3:50:09] in the garage my garage as long as you
[3:50:12] can take care of my flowers he said it's
[3:50:15] all right so he went in the
[3:50:17] garage of this woman and out of there he
[3:50:20] was taking care of the
[3:50:24] flowers humility
[3:50:28] character before a big
[3:50:31] blessing if you are
[3:50:33] proud you will never be
[3:50:37] blessed and then finally
[3:50:42] the same God who came to joh charity
[3:50:43] some years
[3:50:47] ago came to this woman she was
[3:50:51] sleeping and God said to her take a
[3:50:56] check of
[3:50:59] $10,000 and give it
[3:51:03] to and he came she came to him you been
[3:51:07] a
[3:51:08] Christian a bible to read when I slept
[3:51:12] God spoke to me and told me to give you
[3:51:14] this
[3:51:15] check I don't what can I
[3:51:18] do he said no it is an instruction
[3:51:23] from I must give it to you will find out
[3:51:27] what to use
[3:51:28] with and when John sh took the CH he was
[3:51:32] with it for a while he
[3:51:34] didn't and then while they were moving
[3:51:36] on the road they saw an old house
[3:51:39] they bought it $6,000
[3:51:43] $3,000 and and they renovated it they
[3:51:46] sold it
[3:51:49] $6,000 they continued like that bought
[3:51:51] another one another one and became
[3:51:55] [Music]
[3:51:57] millionaires that's a
[3:51:59] testimony from our
[3:52:02] Prophet testing to the
[3:52:05] fact that the principle of
[3:52:07] sewing is is
[3:52:10] biblical and of
[3:52:12] God and that it is possible for someone
[3:52:15] to become a
[3:52:17] millionaire because they a good
[3:52:19] s and they sewing the right kind
[3:52:23] of if we receive that
[3:52:26] revelation we shall not

[3:53:05] testimony we were in that room and we
[3:53:07] Shar Fellowship myself and brother
[3:53:10] Gideon and he told
[3:53:13] me has been a
[3:53:16] model in the country on this thing of
[3:53:20] giving this is what he said I'm
[3:53:23] repeating his words said years ago when
[3:53:27] was still poor and the church was still
[3:53:28] very L down there the pastor encouraged
[3:53:31] the people to
[3:53:33] give and then Pastor Gideon also said
[3:53:36] yeah we started radio
[3:53:37] broadcast when people were very poor
[3:53:41] barely had nothing but they had
[3:53:47] rast and brother R continued there is a
[3:53:50] sister who had just served
[3:53:53] us and he said this
[3:53:55] sister had nothing she was a
[3:54:00] housemade and she came in the church and
[3:54:04] brought her
