will you you you know English you'll be fine okay God bless you may the Lord bless you God bless you how many have ever been in a campfire before but you don't sound like a campfire meeting you need to be free here is not church we are outside here worshiping the Lord outside my name is brother Benjamin uh from Kenya especially I've been uh in Mombasa for some time for around 10 years I've been in Mombasa um but I've been attending fellowships in around Nairobi Pastor weekly has been my pastor in Nairobi the team which came here though most of them I did not know them okay uh once more I'll repeat uh yeah my name is brother Benjamin yeah um from Kenya I'm so much acquainted with so many fellowships in [Music] Kenya yeah because I've uh been in the field of that team which was introduced by brother that has been my work since I I grew up in the message organizing meetings and uring everything goes well yeah and my first testimony was about what our pastor team preached yeah the other day when he was talking about running away from God I've been that way for so many years I think for about 15 years 15 even more in the ministry yeah and I've been running away running away running away but as brother Prince said God will corner you at some point how I found myself in Uganda I was still running away I I was looking for a comfort zone away from home but also I was caught again with the ministry uh I married here peacefully I went stayed peacefully I even left my church with Pastor Mo know some of them even there watching I went to a small Church in a place called di your way to Tanzania that's why I took my family after I married got a new house I started a new business I started praying there so that I don't be given responsibilities but the pastor could not also let me sit he started on me all interpretation or sometimes service I'm not around you takeover and uh I ran again away uh God gave me some few things I was doing in Moro that's I came to my wife is from uh Cara she is a Ugandan ug I got her from Little flocks here the church I can see some of our friends here whom I was meeting her with when I used to come around Pastor how am I forgetting it's my good friend Charles uh aor yeah that's where I got my wife from she was in maer that time in the last year some of you were asking me how did you marry from Mombasa and carja they don't match but it was Mombasa and Cala you see when you get someone's daughter when you get someone's daughter Isaac when when elaz got Rea he did not get her from the well straight to their home my pastor used to say a convention is like a well maybe you have not got your wife in your church where you pray or your husband when you go to Wells like this God can do something but even after got her from the world they had to ask her whose daughter are you and he had to go to the Village so I also went to the Village Ina to ask for permission to to to their daughter that's how I knew a place far away from my dreams but I found myself there these Elders here the two of them especially him pastor and another one who is not here they were they were there on me I remember even they sat me down to ask you are you really a Believer the stories we hear about Mombasa they really okay we he people wake up in the on top of of coconut I told them those are just stories it's not like that end in mango another another story but that is just a conception of people it's not like that mbas is a very beautiful city a very good place but like the prophet prophesied about cnia is full of all kinds of mess for you to stay there you have to be really born again uh else the pleasure of this world if you have not overcome you not sustain to be the message so those who were asking me how I came up to kja that's how I went to car yeah so to make that first shot uh when I came back to kja we had a project with my wife we were doing there a family project and even we decided to close one of our one of our main business in Kenya and we said maybe we can be here around but she didn't know I was running away from the ministry to so we stayed very well until uh the pastor of the church where I was he's not around one day he told me prepare you the one preaching on Sunday I said but it Contin like that a lot of things happened I found myself back in the puet and I've been running until uh close to the the end of the last year 2023 when I was seeking the Lord is when he told me you have to be in the ministry especially in then I told my wife I don't know why God is telling me to be in kja now I feel like I should go back but when brother Tim preached that it is struck my heart it was a confirmation of what God had told me and I promised God I will go and now start doing his work so if you are running God will Conor you God put in my heart to have meetings like this in Cara and uh by God's grace together with some few other team which I'm working with around there we shall plan also our dates of having meetings in and we shall organize and we shall announce for you when we announce don't fail to come to carja how many of you have been inja someone here was asking me the place is too dangerous I tell you I came there with the same stories but I've never been affected with anything the place is no longer very terrible for you as I believe come to believing yes when we shall call for people to come to car most of you I'm connected to your pastors here in C they announce you come toja yes don't fear there is no guns they are there but they are not for you guns are there there for the people who are of the world how many believe in the guidance of the Angel the Bible says that he gave you an angel a guardian angel so your angel is on work don't fear come to so shortly uh the second testimony ahead and I believe this one is going to help someone [Music] it was about uh something God uh struck my heart as I was watching some services from Zimbabwe but Pastor gwna some of you have been streaming from him he having a church in Dubai they had a convention this year Dubai and the convention was so powerful like the brother from Ethiopia when he was preaching he said it looks like for you to be a believer you have to be poor you go and search that Convention of Dubai you see the equipment they were using the music team you ADM them you see how they had arranged the converstion and the kind of people who were in the convention One Pastor from Zab whom God sent to preach in UK brother Prince I forget the name but he remembers him I was talking he came there and he said wow past how do you feel when you see all your children are successful I tapped the blessing because one Minister was praying saying I know you have one car if you want a second one come I don't want to ask how many I have cars you might find two or three or none even our God is rich so I had a family out with my wife she's here and I told her we are not comfortable with eating and dressing just around there this year we need God to do something different then I asked her what do you want God to do for you in this year she said I want a job prayed and God told me she is going to have a job today when I was coming away from the outside the fellowship all she called me actually on our way to the meeting we were coming to pick our transcript in she has never picked them because I married and we went to Kenya I had faith that she should pick them because work is coming she called me she's like you remember I texted this person I need a job a big politician here in I told her yes and she ignored my message right now she has texted me and told me I want to give you a offer but don't fail me she like could that that be true honestly I can't believe they talking to me I asked why did you come to the meeting what were you tapping from the sermon you don't believe an angel can work for [Music] you I said I believe and she made a call some time back before we came here and she confirmed is a real thing God can also bless you you need to raise up your faith don't be satisfied with poverty don't be satisfied with poverty even as a young person some of you are not marrying because of poverty yes some of you sister are not married because they looking at her brother is poor the riches they don't come from the brothers they come from Gods everything some of us if we tell you how we married it will be a testimony of another day but one thing I can assure you if you trust God I've never slept angry in my life neither as she slept angry in my house we may lack some few things here and there but God has taken care of us so for you young people money is not the problem the problem is your faith to receive the money so you believe God when you come to when you came to this meeting he has answered your prayer but don't just get satisfied where you are God can raise you to a different standard so I'm your humble brother again Benjamin may the Lord bless you I had not plan to give a testimony now when pastor called me because we had a plan to have a meeting after this meeting all of it me he said you testify I was asking myself what am I going to testify but for a Believer a lot of things God has done for them so may the Lord bless you we don't meet again as they said we meet up there bless you my wife is here with my daughter but thank you so much brother we are so grateful for the testimony amen as sister Karen will come to sing for us amen I will also ask the the brother uh Brothers Pastor success is it aaki or aaki from the West n as he prepares to

make this small testimony I'm by the name brother chakis sis I'm a pastor my church is just four months old um it's 4 month old and I'm just two years old in the message um I'm not new into the gospel I've been serving under Christ Embassy Ministry [Music] P but as I was serving God met me it was one night when my regional pastor called me to go and open another church in another town somewhere in my region at campus I was sent and I went and open their branch in ARA City and they sent a pastor there God called me as an evangelist after that I went and open another church for that very Pentecostal Ministry in my home town called nav I grew it for 3 years and I got 50 members as a young man I was so Z so much that I wanted to open church here and there so they sent me to go and open the next Church the Church in another town called so as I pray to prepare to go and pray open the church the Lord told me you're on your own I'm not with you look at myself I've served in this many for the last seven years are you sure Lord you're not with me then I asked myself what have I been doing so I prayed again I thought maybe it was my thought the same voice came you're on your own I'm not with you I called my regional Pastor I said I'm not going to that mission of P to open a new Branch because God is not with me he thought I was being rebellious I said I don't want to go and do what God is not part of so he said I'm going to send to headquarter Ina in where that's where the headquarter of the ministry is as a young man I so much wanted to be like those spiritual fathers of mine the Pentecost I loved Pastor Chris so much his ministry called Christ Embassy one of the powerful Min in the Pentecost they are rich most of the big pastors there in Nigeria USA they fly using their own Jets we all wanted to be like them as young men I wanted to be promoted and also go like them but the Lord said that he's not with me so that very night I said Lord take me to a Ministry where which is also Global like Christ Embassy which is also having loaded pastors because I I I want to serve the Lord but also want to make money I like business and businessman I want the Min which is having greater reation than Christ Embassy I want deeper Revelations I want to have the bragging right of the revelations yes I'm leaving Christ Embassy the Pentecostal but I want a bigger church so I stayed for two months and there they told the whole congregation and everybody that success has backed so as I prayed one day a certain man came and invited me and say that come and we pray in the message then I was like what is the message that message sometimes we call it the Bram I've never heard of such Ministry is it in this town also CS is there you come I came so they on that day I I forgot what they told Mar but the pastor preached about baptism it was so new to me that we don't baptism is in the name of Jesus not in the Trinity I got the next time they preached about um Church order yeah in Pentecostal it's so disorganized there's no [Music] ordering us women are pastors everything is so the man preached about I was amazed the next day preached about church ages so many things then I began seeing a lot of things a lot of things then I was like I think I've arrived where I wanted praise the Lord so when I arrived I told that Pastor in ch that I found where I wanted to be I of the Prophet where he was talking about the Eagles that Eagles have okay it's like eagles know where they belong one day if if if if an eagle if an eaglet maybe hidden somewhere one day when the bigger Eagle F and he hears the voice of that eagle it will fly and go that mother and moves I was that e that small ego which was somewhere hidden when I heard the voice of this man of God Prophet Bram I felt like this is what I wanted from that day on I've loved the prophet iously so much his word last year in October uh not necessarily it was around AUST I went for [Music] convention then as P gon was preaching on the baptism of the Holy Ghost I received the Holy Ghost as he preached and the fire of the evangelism came back I got fired up I went back to my town I said I'm not going to be praying in this church here anymore I'll go back and begin my evangelism and evangelize in October last year I open we began evangelism we evangelized we got nine people preaching this very message yeah I don't have much of the revelation of the Prophet but the evangelism Spirit was in me I preached and today we are around 20 there in our church is progressing we are still few the first day we began the service I was arrested because one time I was in so much involved in politics it was a wrong politics because I was mobilizing for no those days when I was still in Pentecostal I used to be the N mobilizer in west region as theth mobilizer so when I when I held my first Fellowship in that hotel Hall they went and T the intelligence of the district there that this n mobilizer has gotten some youth here I don't know what they are doing then they arrested me put jail then they came and investigated they found that we were just for Sunday service they dropped the case they left me out we have contined those service and the gospel is continuing God so bless you I'm glad I came here so as I was coming I invited my young man from Congo he's my fellow businessman that little brother called came from who were to meet in campal I said if before we meet for our business first come and we attend this convention so he came to attend say that I can attend to him for all business meeting praise the Lord I really want him to also come and enjoy this Revelations I'm enjoying the benefit of our friendship not just stops in business it should go up to the uh I'm asking all the members here to pray for our new ministry in there people say that you are just new you have not been here you're are supposed to be a song leader you're supposed to be a Deon before you become a preacher that's what I'm hearing from some of the message Believers there they say that a lot of steps but Gideon told me if God has called you he will give you the revelations will vindicate you and the Holy Spirit is enough for you you don't need anything you and the Holy Spirit is you only need the Holy Spirit to form the team to win and be there to serve the Lord I also thank God one month ago he added unto me and he invited me to come and attend this program he has inspired me a lot I'm glad am among my fellow young people I'm inspired to go back to to continue serving the lord as I used to I call upon you to always remember us in prayer God bless you for giving me the opportunity to share the message amen God bless you my brother we appreciate him amen so uh I know Pastor

[Music] Hallelujah is that [Music] all brother PR if you know where he is please help us get him musicians are you really happy okay so there's a song I want to sing and then I say a few comments but really mainly the purpose of this service is uh to for you to give testimonies that are coming out of these meetings how many can say that the Lord has done something for them now we want you to come and talk about that only that what God did before for you before no problem talking about these meetings tell tell somebody Focus we fusing on the meetings your father your mother out there they sent you here they want to know what God has done for you are you following me so that's what they want to hear what God has done for you in these meetings and so come and share that uh if you passed your exams that's okay but that's for another [Music] time [Music] quick announcement the person in charge of the ladies doet uh please you can go and open for them there are those leaving by their B [Music] amen so uh where was I the testimonies coming out of these meetings how many have testimonies again let me see the now that that is somebody who told me that I have a testimony but I'm shy did you know your testimony can actually encourage someone who is streaming this service from s far I just received I've been receiving of I've not been attending to my phone but I've received H one of them that I had had a chance to look at someone from South Africa said that the while the preacher was preaching each of the whole family was streaming the service but each of them was having their own Gadget where they were watching from and so they were in different rooms and so he was saying that his daughter was watching on the on the top and uh he was in the bedroom one of the bedrooms so by the time the father came to check on her during prayer you know as they were as we were praying they were praying with us as we were worshiping they were worshiping with us so you found her under the power of the Holy Ghost and she was filled right there in her bedroom how many has got filled with the Holy Spirit in these meeting there is someone who came to me today and uh said pastor I have a problem when I went to to pray at the altar I I noticed that my hands were feeling as if electricity has gone through me and my mouth as if it has been shocked by electricity and that electricity was just so much on me and she was wondering whether she was having a problem but I have a question for you I want some young person to answer that question you answer if you are shocked by electricity there's no more electricity can you be the same no what will happen to you you'll be shocked by and then what happens you you die are you hearing when shocks you you are not going to remain the same because you will die you're so quiet I said you are so quiet when shocks you what will happen to you you will die now what about if the power of the Holy Ghost comes upon you what will happen to you what will happen to you what happened to you your old nature will die and so I told her sister I would have been surprised if this was not happening to you and I believe that the power of the holy spirit is real you had a brother testify here how you received the Holy Spirit if you have never received the Holy Spirit I tell you it is real and it changes and it impacts your life and sets you on New Path praise the name of the Lord and so we are so thankful for those that God has filled and uh Brothers give me that Rhythm let us sing this song okay let us stand because I can see

you can come and give your testimony is testim he's on fire for the testimony God bless you Brethren I have a brief testimony um my name is brother Matthew Matthew I'm from from church my pastor is Pastor uh honestly I really appreciate God for these youth meetings I managed to attend yesterday's uh morning uh sermons that was uh without the the what Morning Glory I attended the service after the Morning Glory the morning service and the afternoon service but the evening service I did not attend CU I had to catch up with work then from work I came from work I came right away today for up now but honestly I want to really thank God for I came to this place when I was very heavy in my heart I just like you know uh What uh uh our brothers uh brother from uh brother team was preaching about about your value you reach a point whereby You're So Heavy in Your Heart with a lot of [Music] frustrations and if you just can't move on you can't even make a word in prayer but I want to thank God that when I came here I'm not going back I before I I can get to the point is that whenever I am coming to a a a youth meeting or a [Music] service I'm always under expectation and I've always told God fulfill my expectances I want to thank that uh he fulfilled my expectances all the bur that I had in my heart he lifted them up for me I feel light in my heart it's not imaginary it is not imaginary it is not intellectual it is not something that I'm just assuming but I feel it for myself Jesus said he that the son has set free is free I just feel free because the lord gave us all the bullets Satan I told I am justified I am redeemed I was washed by his blood and I want to tell Brethren I am I have not gone back there I came I am I know I have to catch up tomorrow but I God I must stay here because I am here to testify of God's goodness I have not gone back where I came I am very free I am very light Jesus Has Lifted all my burdens I just thank God for that bless God bless you my brother may you inde be free indeed Hallelujah God bless you I meet you God bless you thank you for coming amen uh let us give him a hand uh there is what is brother success huh yes I know yeah come here come here sir I know he has finished but I wanted to talk to him briefly see some certain things we take it for granted because we don't understand what it means I just wanted to be sure how how long have you been in the message now years and how long have you been preaching four months so this young brother contacted me and say to me that you met which pastor the in your area Michael okay I don't know the pastor Michel who is he that introduced you to me Pastor Michael okay so Pastor Michael connected him with me and told him that uh he should be in touch and I I heard you mention about Pastor Chris and about about Pentecostalism now being a believer of the message I think I already told you this but maybe not in details but I'm saying this because there also others are hearing being a believe of the message does not mean we rubbish other ministers but this message sets us on a Higher Ground of revelation of understanding it's just like the chickens and the Eagles and this message makes us to see as Eagles we don't eat like chicken but we eat like eagles and so when when the food has been gathered for Eagles EOS gather there you lose the appetite for what the chicken used to eat but I just wanted to encourage you my brother you just preach this message and I think I saw you you have Vision but God will give you the grace and and and if you you know stay right in the message study the message well yeah we we believe in the Holy Spirit but after you receive the Holy Spirit study the message listen to the message read it and I tell you nothing will stop you who else are preachers here raise up your hand one two three four younger preachers of course not olders all of you are young okay we have H very many young preachers oh okay there are so many so all of you preachers brother when are you leaving tomorrow in the morning before you leave or after this fireplace meet with them all of you who have raised up their your hand meet with him and share your experience we can L up a generation I don't care what the devil thinks I believe we can L up a generation with fire of this message I believe that with all my heart God bless you my dear brother God bless you let us give a hand to brother sucess amen so I'm going to hand it over to brother Enoch and uh I say God bless you I'll see you when we are crossing amen God bless you Pastor I will invite sister Julie joy to come around and testify and then there's a notebook which is lost is read in color if you come across it please pass it over bless you God bless you evening I had made up my mind not to come for these meetings because according to me I thought I had enough meetings he was so excited to invite me in my mind I was like uhuh I'm not coming but then I invited my friend from nairi to come so she called me when she was at the bus Park she told me that you had invited me for the youth meeting and I'm here at the bus Park please come and get me I really felt bad I felt like I could have called her earlier to tell her that I don't want to come for this meeting so I had to come because she was already at the bus so even coming here I didn't pack anything I was like let me go and try and see if it BS me I'll just go [Music] home but for really pked a very big suitcase so the first service I wasn't really moved but the service of yesterday moved me a lot uh when Pastor Tim was preaching I was like uh uh I've taken a lot of time to come here so I CED myself that I should really pray so I prayed and this time I really prayed I really prayed until I sat down and that friend then asked me if I was feeling okay then I told her sister I'm in the spirit then I prayed again so I sat on the front seats and those people who you couldn't really sit and the seats were put like disorganized everywhere so the last time that I prayed uh I then opened my eyes and there was a Bible in front of me it is not my Bible was and I just read that verse [Music] Isaiah chapter 6se the Bible is just open to that to that chapter so I was like okay the glory of God has really come upon me so I W to Pastor I told him that I need you to pray with me so I thought would really make a very long prayer but he told me the glory of God has come upon thee and he smiled at me and said sister that's it so I walked back and I didn't regret to come for this conf another testimony I want to thank God for the bi I easily gift people bibl but I've never owned physical Bible because I was so comfortable with my phone every time I bought a Bible for myself and someone visited me in my house I would justas give the Bible to them so this time around the screen of my phone God so I came to this meeting without a physical Bible and [Music] without of it all they're not even screening the the Bible vers on the screen so some sister behind me she was like sister need like I'm one this so immedi Pastor calling people come for like should I go for this free one I one for myself so I had the king's James vering James and that is the Bible puros to for myself so I just walked the front and that so my friend again told me you really gift Bibles but today someone gifted you so I want to thank God for that and I want also to thank God that I got my mailbox I got a mailbox if you followed Pastor Tim's preaching God bless you amen amen God bless you Sister Julie Joy you appreciate her amen I just want to do as quickly as possible before the people get tired amen and when we call you to come here just use about five minutes so that our friends can also testify brother Church please come God bless hallelujah hallelujah I thank God for this time so we thank for his grace the way he brought us from also to give this chance again to stand before you so the the leader has given us five minutes uh but I moved with a team and then some of them they were saying they want really to thank God you sing a song they want yeah after when we ended the the last service I just got brother he said you'll remain as my brother because the all meeting though we wrote letters or the request from wanted also to praise God but we we were unlucky hallelujah amen but with all that and now I can say thank the grace of the Lord me personally so yesterday I really saw the hand of God on my life whereby when brother Timothy was preaching so I saw God because I was praying really deeply my heart when other people were jumping but for me I was praying my heart so by the time when God just led him to touch me and then took me in front yeah later when he said God has finished all God has done what he wanted so when I went to sit I just felt my right hand I just felt a cold wind flowing over my hand [Music] now so at that very time then brother timoth said you can handle one another you start worshiping God so the same feeling continued but with the Brethren that I was with at that time I saw the power of God moving over my body and went to my neighbor and I saw anointing taking place upon his life [Music] so I looked a bit so heavy but that time I saw my body it was too light I can take the weight can reach hallelujah hallelujah so I thank God so much for that amen amen so that's why I'm giving praise and honor to the Lord he anointed me heang me amen so I know at this time yeah I have not finished my minutes five used I don't know now the leader one minute wow are we really the right time Keepers so uh I want to invite my so one just in seconds want to sing this song want to sing in our own local language and if I have other who here don't mind of the machines for

and come over here let's give them an opportunity to do that I know the neighbors over the other side are saying for all the days we've been here they've not been sleeping because of our noise but this is the reason why we came praise God I'm really happy to be here and I thank God for this conversion I came here with a burden on my heart I came here with with an expectation I said God let not my will be done but yours uh my thoughts I wasn't thinking as a Christian as the Pastor said pastor timoth as was preaching he said when you feel this the bad thoughts just know those are thoughts of the devil and when we were in the service I said God thank you for answering my prayers because I needed a pastor to talk about how I can overcome my thoughts and really he did it and I thank God that I got a gun with two sides that I can believe the sat in no minute amen than me to God I'm really really happy cuz my chains all were broken amen and when Pastor told you that there's a sister who went to to him and told him and told him that she feels like electricity passing in her whenever she I went to the old and I felt even I can't lift my hand CU it was very heavy with with the electric in it my lips with electric in it I really want to thank God for being blessed and I thank God for the ministers he has used God bless you this was the purpose of this of this youth cerence when you see a life changed when you see someone filled with the h Ghost and the power of God over all over them just makes me feel like crying a God is real and she just testified and said all her chains are broken thank you sister Winnie for that song her chains are broken praise God praise God happy to be here thank God briefly because I believe by testimony we overcome our enemy I thank God very much who has given me victory in this convention they have majorly talked about Victory how we can overcome our devil and put him where he belongs I thank God that I overcame last and I thank God that I overcame last of the things of the world because when I used to go to school where I go for Holiday studies I even used to fear to go to school every day I'm scared going there and the rest of them are not Believers and the way you're dressed is not like them you're not inmore and you're dressed you're scared about the next day but you have to go but I thank the Lord that I'm going out of this convention with a pill of fire with me and I am not scared anymore I am just so confident and I am very free and I put the devil where he belongs I thank the Lord very much and I believe when I sing this song I will be set free because it is my heart's desire I'm so sorry to spend your time but it's my victory to testify I'm free from the guilt that I carry from the dull empty life and set free for when I met my Jesus he's made me complete he's for God the foolish child that I used to be oh I'm free from the fears of tomorrow and I am free from the guilt of my past and oh I have traded my shakles for a glorious song I am free praise the Lord I'm free at last oh I have traed my sh for our Glory song I'm now free I praise my God I'm free at [Music] last amen God is not done God is not done sister come over here she said something is telling her she has to say what she's going to say praise God my name is fortunate from nebe I pray pray in Paro church so I have one testimony that I want to tell you I'm in a family we are we are three who are born again my dad mom and I and I have a lot of brothers and those ones are not born again so they are drunkard the moment they are drunk they just come they fac me they said fortunate anytime you are going to kill you but I just asked myself god what have I done to this Brothers of mine then there was a time I asked them what have I really done to you they said my our dad has taken you to school and you have studied and for us you are left I told them I said just because of the grace of God otherwise even my dad cannot afford that money to take me to that extent it's just a grace of God then I was so stressed to the extent that even in the church I cannot participate even church members they are so concerned about my life just go to the church if they are singing praises say I'm just down I don't even stand sometimes there can just start for Rolling from my eyes they so concerned then there was a time now a song leer called me that I'm supposed to go for some advice I just said this is home issues how am I going to explain this I told myself then I heard of this convention say I need to go for for this convention but I'm not going to tell anyone any church member I'm not going to say this but my God said first tell your friend then I told my friend I came for this convention I was not even having money but there was this pastor pastor Pastor from nebe the the one who I've just talked that Pastor said have faith you will go I said fine then I Trav with him I came to this convention what they were preaching really I was not myself I was very happy indeed I said my joy has come back my joy has come back even the tempering that I used to to praise my God even from my shch I don't use it I can just leave it at home because the joy was not really there so Pastor if you can allow me just let me sing this song this song was sung by Pastor Gideon there was a time I just found it on WhatsApp

Pastor came our school Christian it was a dedication for senior sues then he announced about these meetings and I felt really touched I really and I I really said God I I have to be there I have to just be there and be blessed and during this week as it last week as it was beginning I lost hope of attending and I just said God if you just help me to attend I'll testify and I really testify that I'm here and I have been blessed that I was feeling So Unworthy whereby the devil would would come to me and tell me you are nothing before God but our brother yesterday told us that we are brought by the precious blood and we are more valuable than anything in this world and I thank God for that and I thank God that we renew our positions we are Overcomers and Satan is at our feet he has no control over our lives I really thank God for that let's see I want thank God for answering my prayers I remember when I was coming I was in a taxi I started saying Lord At first I I didn't have that okay I wanted to come but I was not on that fire That I Used to Be for other convictions but I was like God let your will be done the taxi but the devil could again distract me and I want to thank you that Jesus has Set Me Free from the bondage of condemnation I condemn myself so much I also don't know why I don't know but even though I do something small I start saying that but you are you really a Christian I just pray that God should help me and strengthen me more and I want thank him that he has already strengthen me through the word that has been preached I was seeing that I'm nothing to God but when I was praying I said Lord for me as myself I see that I'm unworthy but again you're telling me that I was spoked by the precious blood of Jesus Christ I just Breen this is a testimony but as well as I pray that you pray for us youths we have many things that distract Us in the way whenever we try whenever we try to to set my life free from condemnation and another the like the pastor was saying that this day tomorrow must be greater than today then again when you reach tomorrow then the things get worse you say oh Lord what is this but I thank God for the word that was preached I thank God cuz he has given me the G with bullets and I pray that I should use them all the time whenever I try to condemn myself let me remember that I was bought by the precious blood of Jesus Christ and I'm going to hav CU I'm just a stranger here I sometimes wonder how comes he CH me thank you Lord praise the Lord uh I've never seen anybody who can be able to explain Supernatural things Supernatural things cannot be explained by natural things and when God has done something for something for someone that is Supernatural you can easily tell I I have two more people that and um listen if it's a testimony I'm going to allow them how many agree with me I don't want people singing anymore God bless you I really thank God that I came to this confession I came with an expectation of being delivered and things as battling with but I came under expectation to be delivered during the service and Pastor team was ministering after the service he told us to gather together and pray with a friend and the power of God moved within us and I was delivered I didn't want to give the testimony but how do they call it yeah so I felt like I was cheating God if I don't give that testimony so I was like I'll not give it because there are very many people time has gone but I thank God that he delivered me he filled me with the Holy Spirit and I thank good that after that I don't remember the exact service today but after the service Pastor came on the pit and he said he was talking about forgiveness and he said I don't know why I'm pushing this that I believe it's for someone I had that thing I had this person I was like I've forgiven them but deep down I had not forgiven them and you can the prophet says you cannot have perfect faith when you don't have that forgiveness so I was like I let go but whenever I meet this person that thing comes back and I find out that I've not forgiving them so in the past I was really pushing on forgiveness I let my heart out to God I was like God I've really forgiven this person and I thank God that that thing like when you don't forgive that thing the heart there's a there's something but I thank God that it left I feel free even if I meet this person I am so happy and I thank God for that God bless you praise God I'm sister Alice from I appreciate God for this meeting and for the pastor this meeting has been Victorious to me so so Victorious because God has done the miraculous while I was still at home in this church I'm very friendly with sister Mama zo and brother Peter sister M zo brother pet because we've been together in when they are fellowshipping from the church that I Fellowship from and they the ones who told me about this meeting I appreciate [Music] God but when I'm not working so well told me he was telling me about contribution where is Victory that's where the devil is at certain times I was working so well contrib when they told me about the money for contribution the devil came and started disturbing my work when I had my set my business set when I had the money for business because I sent mine so quickly because I know the one I believed I appreciate God I'm the only girl in our family that that is saved and one that is hated for salvation sake I was studying I end in why did she stop inor because she got served my sister is a head mistress she was the one paying my school fees so when she saw that I had gotten saved and I was standing in the word and she told the family and it's a Catholic Family and then she made sure everyone hated me but that God who rich and good I appreciate God and he makes there's no way on the side of my mom there were some Believers when this one made sure everyone hits me and refused to pay school fees for me I said I'm not letting go of God and my dad sent me away from home so I ran and came back to camp and I worked as a house girl now I have my uncle who is a lawyer when he saw that I love studying and he saw that I'm struggling and I was his blood he said come and I teach you what you want while I'm still standing and I'm still standing in the anti believer's Tabernacle and he told me tell me what you want and then I started toring and after he was done paying for me he set up a business for me now I appreciate God for this meeting because I've not been getting money well and I pied my capital and sent it here as a contribution I'm a who doesn't no much I appreciate God that I've got many jobs including Brides that I've been working for and some other thing have come to Tes I was coming and the devil fought this journey he first made sure my phone is lost and then I saw it my and my song book because I also wanted to sing a song and then I left them in town and I forgot where I left there that good God who does wondrous things that I've got a new Bible God bless you God bless you I thank God so much for his meeting because they have not blessed only me but blessed many people when I came I felt really bed and the first service yeah I just recorded and then second service of brother talked about me Ione I sat down I listen but I couldn't believe it and some I brushed it but I knew then second service started with like a different topic toward the end about the same thing so um the mind I have I have a very artistic [Music] mind I had a very artistic mind like uh the devil would okay I could think and it feels real to me I can say that I lived I lived more on my thoughts than reality yeah but I thank God very much because I believe I don't I don't feel very free but I have the courage and and God has given me the Nugget God so much God bless you thank you for all the testimonies where Sam some can I have a little more sound is the sound have you just stand it down okay so I'm going to give us the last one then we shall close I thank the Lord I'm one person who is shy coming here to testify have just broken through but I thank the Lord last the devil had magnified himself in my life I've been walking in a life of fear when the devil is trying to tell me that I cannot make it in prayer even when I start praying I just cry and saying God help me when I feel I'm not going through and I C to the Lord and I tell Lord be merciful to me because I've never loved being a pretender in my life but I thank the Lord as we beginning there before we began there I told him Lord I've let you down so much this year truly I go so much let go down so much [Music] [Music] I had a lot of pain with me and I was trying to look for something to take it away and instead of reading the word and looking unto God I always went to YouTube and watching movies trying to take away the pain but nothing could help I was in a very bad sad life the last Sunday of last year as beginning this year I prayed [Music] from God spoke to me in the scripture of Luke 3: 11 and spoke of that lady who always came to the church with a crippled and he say that that LE came to church with a crippled back praise and then goes back still with crippled back and the preacher said might be coming to church every time but always going back with the same crippled condition like that lady who was weak and I said God this year I've also been with a crippled going to church but seeing no change I thank the Lord in that scripture and that has been my prayer even before I came for [Music] the the next suay I went to through that scripture and the preacher read that same scripture before even the week before the converstion I dedicated myself into the presence of God I put fasting away and I asked the Lord and said Lord I want you to touch me in this convention that I'm going to because my decision has been that Lord let me walk with you in this [Music] year TR last year I laid down God my life has really been bad in the presence of [Music] God but I made a decision to walk with the Lord this year and I thank God I thought I wouldn't be forgiven and I was saying Lord have mercy upon me just like you did upon that woman but I thank the Lord who says that he doesn't judge me and he says that I'm precious to him and he's told me that he bought me with his own blood and he told that my name is written truly God has not judged me I thank the Lord I'm delivered I thank the Lord I don't have the burden that I came with on my heart and I thank the Lord that I am free I thank the Lord for this convention last year I was online but I Cried unto the Lord and I said next year among those that are going let me be [Music] among I thank the Lord that I'm not going back this the same way I came I

6:30 a.m. of the P day our bodies are wear but our hearts are hungering for more want to be in this presence more and more hearing many testimonies it just Thrills us Lord I know there are many who would have wanted to tell their testimonies but they did not get an opportunity but we thank you for all that you have done we thank you for all the the souls you've impacted I remember when I first

corners of the country young people that are hungering for [Music] and for many other countries as well and impacting their life always say glory to your name you have done great things and Lord at
