[Music] Oh, let us sing it one last time now. It reaches. Oh, it reaches to the high. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Highest mountain. Oh, it goes and it goes. Hallelujah. To the Lord.

Father, Lord, we are complete in you. Lord, we know that your blood will never lose its power. Someone here tonight that needs your saving grace, grant it to them, Lord, because your blood will never lose. Whatever that every brother, every sister has needle, may you, Lord, prove to them that the blood will never lose its life. It is as fresh as it was on the day when it was powered down. Lord, you is as powerful. It's as glorious. And we know it's the word of the hour. And as we are going to listen to the word tonight, I pray oh God, you will open our hearts. You give us liberty to speak. and you will open each of our hearts that you may minister to us. Lord, a little inspiration you've given to me tonight. May May I go be taken out of the way, Lord, even the interpreter, every one of us, Lord, that you may be able to speak to us, we commit this service to your heart in the lovely name of our Lord Jesus. Amen. Amen. I'd like to greet you saints in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Let's quickly go to uh the book of Matthew chapter 7 vers um I have a lot to speak about tonight. So just pray for us that we'll be able to deliver it to you. Matthew chapter 7. I'm going to read 2. If you're there, say amen. &gt;&gt; Beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves. Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit, but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Uh read verses 18 again. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit. Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is held down and cast into the fire. Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them. [Music] forch. [Music] Amen. God bless you. May be seated. Thank you for making an effort to come to church today. It means a lot. It means a lot to you, to me, to to every one of us. It is important for you to come to church whenever there is a service. very important. You know, people make investments uh in real estate, what they call real estate [Music] and they call it real estate. But actually real estate investment is the time we spend with the Lord. If you close down your business, you come to church, you can never lose. It is impossible. And I just I'm praying and I I'm continuing to pray that God will give us more people in this church that have that revelation. That uh everything else does not matter when there is a service at church. You heard of a brother who his business is at a level whereby he meets presidents [Music] But one time the president was trying to make an appointment with him during service time. They told his office to tell them to tell the office of the president that he was too busy engaged with another in another meeting with God and he cannot turn down. I think that's a revelation. Amen. So what what is it that you you would be doing that would be so so so important more than being in charge? Try to always come to Jesus. Amen. As I'm studying, as I'm praying, as I'm waiting upon God, I'm thinking of you. When I come here and I see you, I feel good and I know then that God is going to feed you. You know, I see several mothers with us here tonight. Mothers that cook food and the family doesn't eat, the husband doesn't eat, the wife, the children don't eat, you know, the servants don't eat. You will feel so weird, so bad. You will feel as if you should never cook again. Is that amen? Mothers, sisters, what I'm trying to say, it's the same way with a preacher. You know when you know Jesus has a table spray and you know when when we say we have a service it means Jesus himself has prepared to feed us. So if you don't show up how do you think the Holy Spirit feels being that you've not come to your post of duty and and the food that has been served for you has not been given to you. It is so bad. It is so bad. Praise God. But when you come, it makes you happy. It makes the pastor happy. It makes God happy. And therefore, everybody's happy. So, how many are happy that are here this evening? God bless you. And those few words we are for those who are alive, not wanting to come to church. [Music] those who are live on on Yeah. So, always make an effort to come. &gt;&gt; So, this evening I um I have a lot of u well the English people say I have a lot of hair on my fork [Music] where I have a lot to talk about and so I pray that you will stay with me. We usually have such a short time on Wednesday nights but and many of you come tired and all that but nonetheless how many are ready to hear from the Amen. So just open your heart relax. Tell your neighbor relax. Tell them relax. All right. So now we we just tie your seat belt. &gt;&gt; Let's get into the word. the narrow way. This is part four. And today you've noticed I've read that part of Matthew where he speaks about to uh being aware of false prophets. [Music] But also um in when you look at verses 13 to 14, it's what we we have been reading for three services now. Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadth to destruction, and many there be which go in their art. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadth unto life, and few there be that find it. This service tonight is going to be a blessing to every believer &gt;&gt; and for us to know really what we are expected of from the Lord and these kind of services the things I'm I'm talking about are really what would help us to mature so that we can be mature believers not young. It's just like if you're raising a child and the child is younger forever, it disheartens you. We want to feed on the word so we can know the principles of the word so we can mature in Christ. He's not coming for a younger church. He's coming for a grown church. He's coming for a church that is perfect. Perfection can only come by growth and growth can only come by the word not part word but full word. And on Sunday I spoke about this way of balam but I really just scratched the surface and I realized I need to get deeper with that. You know it has a lot even the way of Kane really much. But let let me just try to make a foundation and then now we quickly go into uh the subject for tonight. So now here he says that um uh straight is the gate and narrow is the way that leadth unto life. And now we are talking about the narrow way. And you see uh now he warns us of uh false prophets. But these false prophets do not come as false prophets. They come in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening waters. So which means every preacher of the gospel could be a false prophet. So you can now see how important it is for you to really know the narrow way because if you do not know the narrow way, you will be deceived. The church is not going to be deceived by some rappers out there or by some, you know, devil worshippers or some, you know, people that are really way. You know the bride cannot be deceived by alcohol, the pride of life and things like that. We know it is wrong. We cannot even be deceived. Listen, listen, listen. We can't even even be deceived by the lust of the flesh. We cannot be deceived by it. We cannot be deceived by those things because we know it is wrong. We have a revelation of those of of those wrong things. and we cannot follow after them and we are fighting every day to overcome. Amen. But you see the the the devil is deceiving the church in a very unsuspecting way in a way that you would expect. That's why many people no longer want to go to church because they don't feel a reason to go to church. They feel most of the churches are liars. Most of the preachers are liars. And they are right. The false prophets are so many. And and the preachers who are preaching but they are not said by God are so many because the devil knew if I can capture the church, let me go in the name of their God. So he will always try to come and deceive but we are so delighted by one fact but the elect cannot be deceived. It is impossible for the elect to be deceived and I believe I am one of the elect. I cannot be deceived. That is the place where we get our consolation. Amen. that we cannot be deceived. We will not walk in the broad way. We will walk in the narrow way. But you see, it is like walking on a razor's edge. Because deception is not only in Roman Catholicism, deception is within the framework of the church. That's why the prophet say if the true church can be able to discern the false spirit the wrong spirit. Praise the name of the Lord. I read it for you last time that that is working within the framework of the Christian church. If we can be able to discern that Praise the name of the Lord. Let me let me just read that portion for you here and then now we can carry on after that. It is in the church age book somewhere. Praise God. Okay. Here right here it says this is just very interesting. It says now now it says um but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit is talking about the spirit which is against Christ. So this is the spirit we're talking about the antichrist spirit which is um the false the spirit of pro false prophets wrong teachers. Amen. He says that um um that he that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm for more powerless and um you know the book of revelation reveals Saturn's works you know which is attempted destruction ction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word. M &gt;&gt; you see he says he knows Satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invisible now now listen if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within. Where are those spirits? Both of them are within the framework of the Christian church. Where is within Rebecca? Where is Abel? Abel is within the woman Eve. Just like Cain is also within same womb two different seats, right from the beginning, we see Esau and Jacob fought beginning right in the womb. Right in the womb. They were fighting. They were born fighting. Praise God. What were they fighting for? They were fighting for the birth right. And the Bible says have I hated but Jacob have I love. So which means the elect was loved even before she was born. The love of God. How do you know it? You know the love of God by election. Amen. You know when Isa was born, Isa was loved by the father. And remember the father of Esau, his name is Isaac. Isaac was a seed of Abraham. Isaac was a son of God. But Isaac could not, I don't know why, but he could not discern the city that was in in in Esau. And and yet, brother Bam said that he was a prophet. But he loved Esau more than you know Jacob. Can you imagine what kind of love was that? That was human love. Not God is love. That was the love of Isaac. So Isa looked like he was favored. We had the birthight. The father wanted to give him all the blessing. But you know what? The elect cannot be deceived. Amen. You know, no one can take away the blessing from Jacob because Jacob was loved by God. The love of God is not tested. It's not tested by how much you have. The love of God is not known by how much money you have. You may be the poorest of the poor. You may have nothing in this life. But my brother, if God loves you, That shows he elected you. His love is manifested through election. Amen. When did he elect us? The Bible says he chose us in him before the foundation of the world. Amen. We are here manifested here. We conform of God into the image of his son. The devil cannot stop that because it is by design. It is by divine blood. It is by divine foreign. He knew us when he chose us in him. We were a part of his character. But you see these two seeds are always together in the same church in the same womb. Praise God. But a shark will not be here with a sin. Hallelujah. Just like you see yourself, you have body soul spirit. Real believer, make believe unbeliever. But you know what? The shark will never be here with a seed. Amen. You, the real you will put on your real funny body and you will drop this nonbeliever body. This body which will never be saved. This body which is so lustful, this body which has made you suffer. One of this morning we will fly away. Hallelujah. We will drop this bodies. He will overcome for sure. It is a living reality. Whether the body believes it or not, it will not stay with me forever. I have another body. Praise God. You see now he says if the church will get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church. within the message, within our churches, those seeds are there. If they were in Paul's church, they were they will be in Brham's church. Are you are you following? Because those two seed we see them starting right out in the beginning in the Ephesian church. They were right there made manif. But you know what the master said? He said do not uproot the wrong seed. Leave it until when the end until the time of the end. What is that time? The time of the harvest. Amen. He said when the when he comes he he will separate the right seed &gt;&gt; from the wrong seed. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other one he will take into the garden and the other one he will burn it. And you know that time is now. This is harvest time. God is amen is doing a final work calling his final seed. out of the husk of denominationalism of religion of traditions of men into Christ because said it has been revealed to me the place where you should gather. Amen. Why should we gather? Because it is a time of harvest. Because it is harvest time. You can only a you can only gather the grain. during harvest time. This is harvest time. Amen. And he said, "Has been revealed to me where we should gather, where you should gather, not in Jefferson. It's not in Texas. It's not anywhere. It is in Christ." Amen. Amen. So the bride is being gathered in Christ. That's why you must be born again. you must be filled with the Holy Ghost. Amen. Because that's the place where you are. You must be found. Praise God. Amen. And now we see here that you see these two seeds, these two spirits in the framework of the Christian church. But you see these two church by God spirit. this true church by God's spirit if it can discern and withand the antichrist spirit Jacob designed and withtood. But you see one thing that gave Jacob grace to overcome was the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Amen. By by God's spirit design and withstand the antichrist spirit. Satan will be powerless before her. Amen. Amen. Amen. If God can give us the grace to discern the wrong spirit and to overcome it, to reject it, to withand it then Satan will be powerless before us because we are the church triumphant. We are the savior's bride. We are the witness. Amen. Hallelujah. Oh, glory to God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We are the original seed which was planted in the beginning. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So now you see why we need to talk about this narrow way. Because the narrow way can only be walked on those who have discerned and withtood the antichrist spirit. Praise God. Amen. And so Jude wonders in verse 11. He says, "Why are to them the false prophets?" You know, for they have gone in the way of Cain, and they ran greedly after the error of of of Bam and perished. And this is the part we're going to talk about today. And perished in the gain saying of Kora. That's the last part of verse 11. Yeah. Now, three things we looked at. Praise God. Amen. How Jude was warning us of of of these false preachers of this antichrist spirit. How he was warning us, how he was helping us to discern it so we can withstand it. And he gave us three examples. Oh, hallelujah. In the Old Testament, he said, "What? How can you know them?" We know he has said already in Matthew, "You shall know them by their fruits." So now we can see the fruits of Cain. We now know who he is. We have known his serpent seed. He tried to worship without revelation and amen. People died. The spirits don't die. The spirit of Cain is alive to die. People who will try to serve God by the way of religion but not by revelation. You know they walking in the way of care. Amen. And when the word of God comes, they don't have revelation. Nothing in their heart to reveal it to them. But the bride of Christ has revelation. Revelation sets you apart from everybody else. And we found that faith is revelation. If you want to please God, you must have faith. Without faith, it is impossible to please God. And therefore, because we have faith, Amen. We are pleasing God. Amen. Hallelujah. Right now I can say, well, praise God. I see a group of people that are walking by faith and not by sight. Amen. Who are they? They are the bride of God. They are all over the world. Walking by faith and not by sight. Why? Because we have received the revelation of the word of God for our generation. We are walking by faith. We are walking by faith. Like Enoch, one of these days we will walk and the word will see us no longer. Hallelujah. Why? We are walking by faith and not by sight. We are not going in the way of Cain. We are going in the way of sin, in the way of Adam, in the way of Adam, the second Adam. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we we notice he warned us also of the error of Balum who was uh just running after reward. You know, and we notice the spirit of Balum works in two ways. Fornication, idolatry. And you see fornication we talked about brother was telling us that you see the spirit of fornication is is is the same same spirit of diluting the word and rejecting the truth and believing false teachings doctrines of men traditions of men instead of the word. And he said all those religions that have rejected the word are fornicating spiritually. We we read about on Sunday about the woman who the Bible says was uh you know uh having a cup filled with the wine of her fornication. And we saw that the wine of our fornication pointing to doctrines and teachings and ideas and traditions that men have received of her. The Bible would even say she she has made the kings of the world to drink of the wine of the cup. And you know you see that that's the biggest religion in the world. The richest of it all you know you know decked with the gold and pearls and precious stones. It is the richest church all over the world you know but it has false teachings of the trinity of worship through people and scapulars and and all things to replace Christ. And you know they are the mother a lot. She's the mother of all of them. And because she's a mother, we saw she has daughters. And those daughters as fornicators just like her. Why? Because they are receiving the wine and they drinking the wine. They have received the false teachings, the false ideas, the false traditions and they have drunk it. And because of that they are also uh fornicators. The Bible called her the mother hall and they are the positive daughters. Who is the mother hall? The Roman Catholic religion. Who are the who are the daughters? The Protestant denominations. That's Bible prophecy for you. And who are we? We are none of them. That is why we are not a denomination. We cannot be a denomination. We are only the bride of the world. We feed on nothing but the word. We don't feed on a man's ideas but the word. We don't feed on traditions of men but the word. We don't feed on following men but the word. &gt;&gt; We are the bride of the one. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are the one that is spoken of in Revelation 19. Amen. Glory to God. What does he say? She says the marriage of the lamb is come and his bride has made us separate. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. We are his bride and we are ready. We are ready. I said we are ready. What? What made us ready? We are made ready by the word. Amen. And that's the third pool ministry of the prophet. You see the opening of the word. You see what it does? It makes the bride ready. Amen. For the word of God is good. Amen. And for what is given the Bible says by the every word of God is given by inspiration. every scripture by inspiration so that it can accomplish work that every man of God may be perfect, [Music] furnished unto all good works. The word of God is here to make us perfect. Amen. You're not going to become perfect by your works. You're going to become perfect by the word. Amen. Are you hearing me church? Now we see that the spirit of the era of Balam for made the people go into fornication is a spirit of religion. And the Bible says all the fornicators have their place in the lake of fire. The lake of fire both the spiritual fornicators and the physical fornicators. [Music] That is why There is nothing in the Bible that I know of that tells us to separate with anybody [Music] apart from the one who is fornicating. Why? Because fornication is to God the worst of his kind. It takes away your spiritual virginity. It takes away your your your the way you look at yourself and the way you look at the world and then you become an object of lust. And that's why said Hollywood has made a woman a sex garbage kind. And with all the movies they act, you know, the way they present the woman, the way she's dressed, the way, you know, they present her is all in a filthy way that she's just there to be used. But you see that's not how God has intended for what God has intended for a woman. And he proved it when he came to Mary and he said, "You are chosen among all women, blessed among all women." Amen. When he got himself came into the world by a woman, he proved it that this is what a woman was supposed to do to bring forth Christ. And that's why there is another bride, the women of Adam who cannot fall. Why? Because she is predestined to bring forth Christ. We have a womb also, the spiritual womb. When we receive the word, the seed, the word is a seed, &gt;&gt; the original seed. When we receive it in our heart, we cannot bring forth any other. We cannot bring forth an only for Christ, the second Adam who cannot die. who is like God in the image and likeness of praise God. So Balum the era of Balam will take people into denominations which is spiritual fornication and and you know idolatry which is worshiping other gods by the God of Israel and there's much I said we can talk about that but tonight I want to talk about again sayings of God and you see that um now that Jude was warning the believers not to Go in the gain sayings of Kora. Who is Kora? Amen. Represents rebellion against God's chosen leadership. So now false prophets who are lying and liars don't come only in false worship without revelation. They not only come with false teachings, they not come only with fornications and idolatry, but they also come in ways of rejecting God's chosen leadership. That's the way of Kora sayings of Kora. He challenged Moses and saying we are holy too and he was destroyed. Those who walk in corous rebellion resist God is order. They reject God's order and authority in the church. Did you know God has his own order? his own authority. The way he wants the church to be ruled, the way he wants God has a way that he wants his people to be led. And the way God leads his people has never changed from the beginning to the end. How does he does he do it? He sends a man. And when he sent that man, we have always seen that man will never be the best. He either send somebody who is young or he sent someone who is downcast or he send someone who is not educated or he send someone who doesn't know how to talk or he send someone who is insufficient or he send someone who people think is a sinner. That's somebody who, you know, is out of the ordinary. Why? Because when God chooses a man, he wants to be the preeminent one. Because God does not share his glory with anyone. So when God chooses a man, he has already looked at him and he has trained him and he has taken him through a process and he has already known his end right from the beginning and then he chooses him and then he says, "Oh, I want to use you." So now when anyone comes and goes against God's choice as the spirit of the antichrist, It's like saying that God never chose right. God chose a Moses. A man who was educated, a man who knew how to fight, a man who knew how to speak, a man who knew everything. Listen to me, church. But Moses reached a time when he thought he could do it on his own. And the whole time, God was not with him. God wasn't with him. And then you know he killed a man and because he did it without God is involved. God told him sort it on your own. But whole time his eye God's eye was on Moses. I want to tell you tonight God's eye is always on his chosen one. God is eye is always on the spiral. If God chose you for any work, no matter your failures, he's watching you. He's waiting for a time for a moment when you will yield yourself. Then he can now say, "Let us begin the work." And then Moses after 40 good years you know he failed everything but he is now a little shepherd very old 80 years old he thought I can do nothing good anymore now God said it is now time for me to call my man Amen I called him I chose him I ordained him before he was But he wasn't ready yet. But [Music] now that he feels insufficient, it is the time for me to now send him out. Oh, praise God. And then God comes down to old Moses and he tells him, Moses, it's now time. It's now time. Let me tell you brother, Moses killed people when he was working in his own ability. You may be called by God. You may be you may you may be you know sanctioned to serve God. But if you hurt people in the process of ministry, it's not your time yet. It's not God's hand on you. God can never lay his hand on a man. for him to hurt other men. Ministry is fragile. The work of God is very fragile because we are dealing with souls. And he wants his souls, his people, the words he possess with his blood to be taken so important. It is not the servant who is important. It is the people, the soul that are important. And a shepherd must be a man of the people. A man that David would talk about. And I and he would say in Psalms 23 and talk about the shepherd and talk about the shepherd say he leadth me to green pastures. And in the New Testament, Jesus came and he said, "I am the good shepherd." And when he sends a man to shepherd the people, he has already trained him. But if a man begins hurting people in the lion ministry, in the days of ministry, it shows it's not the time for his ministry. And when the time was right for Moses, Moses thought he could not do anything. That's why every God called minister must never feel sufficient in himself. He must never feel sufficient in himself. He must know I can do nothing of myself. That's even how Jesus felt when he was on earth. He said I do nothing except the father shows me without him I am nothing. That's God found in a fashion as a man. So friends when Moses came to that place of vulnerability human frailty then our God said it's time to go and he sent him and Moses said I'm not able. Don't you worry, I'm with you. Go. Now, Moses went after many years of God dealing with Israel. You you remember how Moses was dealing with the people? You know, of course, Moses had his own uh you know, his own issues and there was a time that he called the people rebels and it struck the rock twice because he had a weakness of anger. He had to pay for it by not going to the promised land. Every minister, whatever you do, there is accountability. And we see that Moses as he was called by God and he went and you know God, you know, with the pill of fire, God was really with them. God was helping him. But then there came a time when there was a man, a brother, a minister, who also thought he was as anointed as Moses did. He was as cold as Moses was. And he could do it just like Moses did. That was the big mistake that Kora did. Where was he when God was sending Moses? Did God know Torah would be born? Why didn't he wait for him? Why did he wait for Moses for 40 years? Because he was he had sanctioned that Moses would be the man. Not every one of us will be used the same way to serve God. Each of you have your own calling. Find your calling. Make it sure. The Bible says, "Make your calling and election." Sure. You have it. Now in the book of numbers 161 now Kora the son of Isah the son of Kth the son of Levi and Dan and Abberam the sons of Elab and on the son of Paleth the sons of Rub and took men and they rose up before Moses with certain of the children of Israel. You see now here is Moses. You will not read in Uganda. is Moses. You know, you know, Moses is just, you know, doing the work that he's called to do. He's minding his ministry. He's calling. Oh, I wish saints we had time to go through this tonight. I have only, you know, um 12 minutes, but tonight I'm going to go a little bit a little over the time. Listen, just just listen to me tonight. And here was uh this gentleman Kora, Isa, Kath and you know Dathan rather Abraham you know these men rose up and they connived among themselves and they rose up before Moses. They came not alone but they had managed to uh you know convince a section of the church and 250 princes of the assembly. [Music] Not common brethren, not the poor, but those ones that were famous in the church, those ones who were paying the biggest t. Those ones who were the richest, those ones who were the renown, read it in your Bible, those are the ones they convinced. Vers three. Amen. And they gathered themselves together. I don't have time to go into the nitty-g gritties. Just follow me closely. And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and said unto them, "Ye too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy." Just interpret it, brother. You take so much upon you because all the church is holy. You are doing too much work. You are the one doing this. Everyone in the church is holy. Everyone in the church is is called everyone. But they failed to understand that the calling was different. The measure was different. The anointing was different. The anointing on your pastor is not the anointing on you. The anointing on your father is not the same the one like the one you have. Are you hearing me, my sister? Your mother's anointing is not the same like yours. Every one of us is given a measure. A measure. Oh my, I wish I had time. Listen, ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them. Wherefore then lift ye up yourselves upon the congregation of the Lord. Moses with all these people of yours, why are you lifting yourself up and making yourself like a lord, a dictator? They had points The points were valid politically speaking. But God is not a politician. The Bible says God is a righteous church. And he is the suffering. Did you know God is not a democrat? No, God is not democrat is neither Republican. God Oh my, I wish I had time cuz I'm hearing many revelation. How does God operate? God is a theocrat. God is a king. He believes in autocracy. He believes in dictating. You don't have to agree with him. You just have to accept what he wants you to say to believe. And how does he do that? That's why he sends a prophet. A prophet doesn't come to debate. A prophet doesn't come to seek for your opinion. A prophet doesn't come to seek for your agreement. A prophet comes to tell you, "Thus sayeth the Lord, follow or die." And all men of God, God sent that say the Lord. And in a generation, God sends one major prophet with thus say the Lord. But another local assembly, God raises a little man, a little prophet who love thus say the Lord for that local church. But even then not everyone is going to be a pastor. Others are called as apostles, others evangelists, others teachers. Oh my friends, I have no time. But just follow me closely. I'll take it until until you cannot receive it anymore. Listen, vers four. And when Moses heard it, when Moses, a man called by God, when he heard what they say, he fell upon his face. Brother, sister, never do anything to a man of God which will make him fall on his face because of you. That man of God doesn't have to be your pastor. It can be any man who is called by God. Be very careful when a man of God anointed by the spirit of God falls down on his face because of you. Bad news. Moses fell upon his face. Vers five. And he spake unto Kora and unto all his company, saying, "Even tomorrow, the Lord will show who I is and who is holy, and will cause him to come near unto him. And even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near unto him. Listen church. When a man is called by God, God has tested him. God has known this man has no ability. This man has no helper. Just like David saying, I looked onto the hill, from where cometh my help, my help cometh from the Lord. So when you fight against that man, you are fighting against his help immediately Moses. Let's go to God and let God show who is his man who is God thought it is a joking matter. He did not know who placed Moses there. Brother, when you were not there, sister, when you were not there, when God was calling that man, you better not say anything. Our prophet told us, you know what? If you you you don't understand something that a man of God does, stay away from it. Say nothing about it. say nothing against you lest you be found to be fighting against God. Praise God. Vers 28. And Moses said, "Hereby ye shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, for I have not done them of my own hand. If these men die, the common death of all men or if they be visited after their the visation of all men, then the Lord has not sent me. Those are not just blessings. Those are words from a man of God's mouth. Fear man of God. Pastor, are you trying to scare us? No. I am giving you a principle which will go a long way in helping you. &gt;&gt; Oh, Mr. Church. I have seen a lot of young people who have no record for the ministry all over WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; They'll speak this, they'll speak that. They will confront men of God. We here at DBF should know better. And here a man says, if these men die a natural death, then God never sent me. In other words, he declared their death. He announced their death. Vers. &gt;&gt; But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up with all that pertainth unto them, and they go down quick into the pit, then he shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord. [Applause] They provoked who not Moses? But they talked about Moses. By fighting against a man called by God, you are provoking the Lord. By speaking one negative word about a servant of God, you are provoking the Lord. Pastor, even when I've done something wrong. Yes. Shut up. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm going to if I have time, I'll show you. This is biblical. One of their reasons was that Moses married an unbeliever. He married an Ethiopian woman. And they were right. But they had to shut up because they did not call Moses. That weakness that Moses had kept him humble and God knew it. That's why he called you to begin with. &gt;&gt; Now, praise God. I have a lot to give you, but let's just take it to for 20 more minutes. Now, listen here. Let me give you another example. Before we go into the example, there's a quote I wanted to read from the spoken word is the original scene. So just follow me as I read it quickly. How different today many so-called evangelists claim they have the answer from God for the people just as Kora did denying disputing the authority of God is vindicated anointed prophet Moses claiming he had the answer vindicated anointed he denied and disputed This was a money-m scheme, a golden calf as many do today. Big buildings, big schools incubator and they bring forth the same seed and the people then as like now fell for it. And even today many people have fell for those people who are speaking against they don't know what they're doing. digging their own graves, spiritual graves after many many things brother Bham said that I may not understand but he's a man of God. Brother, what do you think about this? And your question is to ridicule the prophet question. I'll not even give you an answer. I have no time for nonsense. What do you think about our pastor? You know, he does it. I have no time for that. And then the people as like now they fell for it. If they had heard had a true word of God through an anointed prophet that was vindicated but they didn't. They fell for Kora's lie. God proven God proven prophet and God knew and he knew God had told them. Israel knew God had told them distinctly that he would even vindicate his prophets by his word. Kora was not a spiritual pro a scriptural prophet but it looked awful good to the people. Same as it does now they will know that someone is not scripturally vindicated or called by God but the things he is speaking are too realistic. So they fall for it. Never fall for reasoning. Today, today is what all people want. Oh, blood on your hands, boils of fire on the platform, oil in your fingers, emotion, things of excitement. And the same thing produces women preachers short hair bob makeup and what do you have? But you see that's the way of Brother, there is only one god vindicated prophet in our day. Forget about anyone's interpretation. People are falling for things. Oh, pit of fire here. Oh, oil on your fingers. Oh, this and that. This sign, that sign, this sign. They are not my prophet. I Moses I know him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see and they do the same thing and I turn away the true word for denomination. It shows what kind of cities in them. But thank God all Israel never fell for Quran. Some stayed by Moses. the anointed prophet with the word of God. Amen. We are one of those. We have stayed with our Moses with the what? The word of God. Hallelujah. Amen. A man is God. Many of God is elected. So it is with them today by his word and his spirit. God, that's how he rules his church. calls a man and when that man heeds his calling, he will lead a church using the word and the spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 15 minutes now, let us go to 1 Samuel um chapter 8 vers one. I want to show you an example here which will blow your mind. Um, and it came to pass when Samuel was old that he made his sons judges over Israel. Now, let me just read it as you read in your language. Now, the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abia, and they were judges in Bashba. and his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after lockup, and took bribes, and perverted judgment. Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together, and came to Samuel unto Rama. And I said unto him, Behold, thou art at old, and thy sons walked not in thy ways. Now make us a king to judge us like all the nations. But a thing displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. You see, that's what they always do, men of God. And the Lord said unto Samuel, hecken unto the voice of the people in all that they have said unto thee, for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them, according to all the works which they have done since the day that I brought them out from Egypt, even unto this day, wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, and so do they also unto thee. Now therefore hecken unto their voice, how bait yet protestly unto them, and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them. I want you to see Samuel. God after bringing this people by Moses and Joshua and all others, now they are in the promised land. And here is a man called by God. And his name is Samuel, the anointed man of the hour. He was a prophet. The one that said that say the Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. I said hallelujah. A man that heard from God. Oh, I can even go back and remind you how Samuel was called. how his mother was barren and how she went before God and sister Hannah called upon her and she said, "Oh God, if you give me a boy, if you give me a son, I'll give him unto you." Right? But right here, &gt;&gt; I want you to notice Samuel when he was born, &gt;&gt; she gave him to the Lord. in the hands of prophet Eli. And God started speaking to Samuel from a very young Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. If you notice when whenever God calls a man, he comes at him early before the devil corrupts them early before the devil brings in this and that to preserve and protect the integrity of the word. God came to Samuel at a very young age and he said Samuel Samuel Samuel ran to Ellie called a second time and Ellie was a priest and God could not speak to him because the man of the hour was Samuel because God had a covenant with Hannah about the child he would Let me tell you brother, don't play with servants of God. Many of these are under covenant with God before they are even born and they coming into the world to fulfill a purpose. They are servants of God. That's why God protects them so to the extent we see here in the situation of Moses. He killed hund because of Moses. Oh friend. It is very very serious. And then now we see that Samuel and a covenant now leads Israel and leads Israel until he grows old. And apparently it looks like Samuel had a succession plan for Israel because God had called him. But God had called no other after him. Did you know servants of God never resigned? Servants of God never retire. Can I hear a bigger man if you believe that? Praise God. They serve for life until they die. That's why brother Bam, you know, in the message, you know, not not a specific message, but all through his message, It it it shows how important it is for you to be sure of who is your pastor. Very important. This is a man who is going to lead you to your eternal destination. If he doesn't have a backbone for the word, you cannot make it, brother. God help us. We don't go to a church because it is the nearest church. We go to a church Because the man that is preaching on that book has a backbone for the world. Praise God. And notice here Samuel is now old, stricken in age. He didn't know what next. God had not called anybody else. God was silent about what next. Because when God calls a man, he owns both his mistakes and his success. That's why it is important if you're married to a man of God to know how to behave. If if you you you gave birth to a man of God, you have to know how you behave. God comes to speak to brother Bham. Brother runs to the house. What if the mother had slapped him? What if the mother had abused him? The mother. You are stupid. What are you talking about? Can't speak. But that was the angel of the Lord. The pill of fire was right at you. So parents, if you know you are raising a servant of God, do it with reverence. You can know by how you see the child growing by the confidence you made with God when the the child was born. You can know you do it with reverence. Knowing God can actually you can have trouble with God by dealing with them in a wrong way. Samuel is now old. He doesn't know what next for his family. But you see, he decided to make his sons judges. Did God tell him? I'm not sure. I didn't read it anyway. &gt;&gt; But but we know the chance of Samuel did not go in the way of their father. They did not follow after the pattern of their father just like the sons of Eli. God have mercy. God have mercy. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. And when I say that, I mean it. &gt;&gt; It is very rare to see a David giving birth to Solomon. Usually children of servants of God go wayward. But God have mercy on our generation that they may go in the way of the world. But you see, he decided to make his sons, not that his sons were called, but he decided to make his sons judges in Israel, but they did not do the right thing. The Bible says they they went after filthy ler money to taking bribes perverting judgment. And the elders in Israel they saw that they were unhappy and they came to someone. Their reasons were justified. Their reasons were right. They came to Samuel and told him, "Prophet Samuel, you you you have served us well, but your children who are judge over us have not gone in the way that you have been going in. So we ask you of one, give us a king." That was a wrong h request at a wrong time. For as long as Samuel was alive, he was still the leader of God's people. [Applause] But they asked a wrong request. You see, maybe someone made a mistake to appoint his sons. We do not know. But God owned his mistakes too. God has a way of liking how to correct his own servants. Israel instead of inquiring from God because you ask me, "Pastor, what would they have done? In such a situation, well, instead of doing a political move, they would have gone to God in prayer. Brother, whenever you have a misunderstanding, go to God in prayer. Listen, I've never been anointed more than right now. And I'm telling you these things from the Holy Spirit. Amen. You husbands, you husbands, lead your family right. Be led of the Lord. Be guided by the Holy Spirit. But sisters, wives, be careful, your headship is not Jesus. It is your husband. Even when he is wrong, don't fight him. Don't call your father, your mother, your sister, your go to God in prayer. on your knees because if God gave you your husband, he cannot come by another way to give you leadership. It is through the God ordained leadership. Because if you go to God in prayer, the God who gave him can give another or can correct him or can take him away or can do whatever is required. And so it is even in a church. Never begin murmuring about the pastor and the leaders of the church. That is the way of kora. The moment you begin murmuring against the pastor, against the minister, against the you know your points may be justified, but it is you who will go into trouble with God. This was the way of Kora. They did they did not inquire from God. They connived and made a decision to have a new king. Was God in that decision? No. This was the way of Kora. It was not the way of God. Even when the pastor has done a mistake, even when he's guilty, there is a pattern. There is a way that God has given to us to correct the man of God. And I want you to follow me closely as I am approaching the climax here. In 1 Samuel 10, Samuel went ahead and and gave them a king because God told him, "Don't you worry my man, they have not rejected you, they have rejected me." And so Samuel in verse 17, he says, Samuel called the people together unto the Lord to misbehaith the Lord God of Israel. I brought you up uh Israel out of Egypt and delivered you out of the land of Egyptians, out of the hand of the all the kingdoms and of them that oppressed you. You have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations. And ye have said unto him, Nay, but set us a king over us. Now therefore, present yourselves before the Lord, by your tribes, and by your thousands and after that he gave them a king, anointed him turned out to be Saul. You know how Saul ended up and you know friends, God is God. He wants to be king of your life. He he wants to be your pastor. He wants to be your leader. He wants to be your shepherd. But how does he do that? He sent a man like the Bible says in the book of Jeremiah, a pastor after his own heart. Praise God. And in this generation, he sent us one in our local assemblies. sends us each one. We should always honor men of God. But he sends us 1 Timothy 5:17, "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine." When God sends you a man who said an elder is a man who is seasoned in the word in the Lord, not a new believer, not a new preacher, whatever, no matter how powerful he is, someone who is older in the Lord, you see, and is laboring in word and doctrine, he deserves loves not just honor double honor DVF. &gt;&gt; I will pound this until we all receive it and then you can be an example to this generation. Isn't it what we're supposed to be to be a reason of all men? 1 Timothy 5:18. &gt;&gt; For the scripture saith, thou shalt not m the ox that treth out the corn, and the laborer is worthy of his reward. Against an elder, receive not an accusation. Come on, brother. Interpret what you remember. against an elder receive not an an accusation. &gt;&gt; Just do verse 19, leave vers 18 because it will mess you up. Against an elder, receive not an accusation. Against an elder, receive not an accusation. Water it down in Luganda and make people understand what the Bible is saying. No. Amen. Open it and read it in the in the in the Lugana Bible. Again, receive not an accusation, but before two or three witnesses, them that sin, rebuke before all that others also may fear. 1 Timothy, I want to finish now. 1 Timothy 5:18. Quickly, don't receive an accusation. Did you hear what the pastor said? Maybe that be your pastor. Maybe you went to a convention and you heard rumors talking against men of God and then you also join in. Can you imagine that pastor? Are they even saved? You a believer? Watch out. &gt;&gt; Never receive an accusation. Anybody who brings it to you, close your ears and walk away whether the man that is being accused is your pastor or not. But as long as he's an elder, do not receive an accusation. But if you want to, you must have two or three witnesses. And brother Bham says those must even be tried. [Music] Friends, I wanted to read you quotes in Hebrews series, but I'll give you the quote 570922E. Go and listen to it. There quite a lot in there. Quite a lot in there. But the time I've asked you is over and I need to get done now. But friends, the narrow way is not going in the way of Kora. It doesn't matter. You may not go the way of Cain. You may not go in the way of Balam. You believe the message, but in the message, you go in the way of God. Start talking against men of God. start reducing their influence, disrespecting them, rumor, spreading rumors about them. I've showed you true or false. God will deal with you thoroughly. This is a warning to us as a church. How should we keep ourel with fear and trembling knowing that this is not about a man, it's not about brother, it's not about your pastor, it's about Christ and when he wants you to be blessed, he sends you a man, but honor that man says he can't even help you if you do not honor There's nothing he can do for you. He said, "I've seen congregations run down the pastor and talk about him and do this and that. There's nothing he can do for you." See, so and I've I've been raised to do that. And and there's a quote I read says no matter what the past the man has done if you can't respect him respect the office he holds in God. If we can do that then we are walking in a narrow. May God bless you. You may stand on your feet. [Applause] [Music] Praise God. &gt;&gt; Do not end that is the way. &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus, I have only spoken according to how you have led me. My desire Lord is that uh people may see you Lord Jesus. They may see beyond the man and see you Lord but also understand the principles of your word. Jude warned the church told us not to go the way of Kora. &gt;&gt; Many young people in our generation have gone wayward thinking they standing but fallen long going into the way of Kora the gain sayings of Kora Lord Jesus help us to respect the ministry the pastors the teachers the evangelists &gt;&gt; the apostles the prophets that you have sent to us, that we may know how to discern the right from the wrong that we may walk according to your ways that we may please you Lord. Grant it, Lord. Bless these people, Father. Even as we are going to dismiss tonight, I ask that your presence will go with us, Lord. And even Lord before we go, we want to give our offerings.
