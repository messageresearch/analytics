come uh will stay there how how god create that heaven and make him stand there well the anointing of the angel will come alive you will be anointed by the spirit of god and you will receive your portion tonight he that enters not by the door into the ship fold but clamps up some other way the same is a thief and a robber but his thought enters in by the door is the shepherd of the ship to him the porter opens and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out and when he puts forth his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice and a stranger will thy not follow but will flee from him for they know not the voice of stranger yokana is [Music] foreign i really want to say thank you again for my beer pastor pastor talema and his fellow ministers it needs someone for you to give you a pulpit confused because pastor has confidence on my ministry now he's giving me the chance hallelujah i'm not a preacher like pastor talema and i'll bring that to you amen amen that's what makes us the bread of jesus christ so tonight without limitations of time day hallelujah we'll we will go deep into the world amen amen hallelujah what's my sometimes wisdom tries to copy as if it is faced but it is not actually faced hallelujah i mean so we shall see what is the difference between faith and wisdom and what do you want now a teacher will [Applause] because i have come out from the tree of life but i can't preach you know all the lies of the tree of wisdom again [Music] tuna again don't matter it is a service i have told you before you need to remain safe you will upgrade your face tonight you have already sacrificed the whole night to die today [Music] in written god will upgrade uplift your face album you can find that the prophet uh has preached us about faith and wisdom you might find it also there the whole sermon it has changed my life it has changed and opened my eyes to see what faith is we have seen that there are two uh there are two it talks about it talks about the ship and the shipper there is only one shepherd there are many ships [Music] but the real shepherd always comes to meet all the ships the other uh the other one [Music] if you are the true ships of god you will be able to hear only the voices of the shepherds because that true shepherd who is jesus christ he will call you by your name he cannot miss out your name hallelujah amen but that stranger he will create a new name for you and he will call you uh like a stranger name he will give you a strange name like the oddballs [Music] amen but the true shepherd our lord jesus christ he always calls us by calling upon our names that is how we differentiate the voice that comes out from the stranger and the voice that comes out from the true shepherd [Applause] [Music] he they have been also introduced in genesis from the tree of [Music] [Music] we find that the source of wisdom is from the tree of knowledge hallelujah so who is the source of faith so that's why she is a source of wisdom that is the battle that is the battle of fights hallelujah amen two tonight we have to start uh to understand or we have to start to know which kind of voice we are hearing in different ways you choose to come here and to to come here oh no and to listen from the the tree of life it takes your decision wait where's salida ahmed amen hallelujah hallelujah but sometimes [Music] even as a believer no more we might so what are these voices all those voices that comes out from the wisdom we have to differentiate tonight is everything that god has put on life that is how it works when we go back in in genesis in genesis chapter three verse one up to five we can see one scenario you remember the story between what happened between eve and the now the serpent was more subtle than any business of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman he has god said he shall not eat off every tree of the garden and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruits of the trees of the garden but of the fruits of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said he shall not eat of it neither shall he touch it lest he die and the serpent said unto the women ye shall not surely die for god does know that in the day ye eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and it shall be as good knowing good and evil [Music] hallelujah there is a mystery in this scripture one way to sue me right away charmer one of the revealed mysteries in this scripture is found in genesis [Music] korean or killing these all are the fruits or the attributes of sin together but what is sin now because that's what we see in chapter three [Applause] but we eat by our ears number two like what we are doing now you are eating the word of god not by your mouth that was just what happened in a garden garden you see earth has been deceived by the serpent um because the serpent asked her has god said ye shall not eat off every tree of the garden after she told him that we can't eat every tree over there the fruits of the trees of the garden but except this and things like that but verse four it says and the serpent said anthocyanin you shall not truly die they have a bible their [Music] there is no need to write genesis exodus any other books there is no need to write new testament all the testimonies because in the beginning there was no [Applause] god said you shall die if you eat from the trees if not you shall live that is the only scripture that was the only word but what did she say she trespassed by believing as if she is not going to die you see this is the tree of wisdom against the wasting the word of god just a little bit just a little bit but that little twist that's why we don't allow javon to kill his at this age or during the whole seven church ages that's why we do not allow for any man to add to deduct from the word of god we accept it as it is a hundred percent if has a hundred percent full face on her god singer she would have refused that voice that comes from the tree of wisdom [Music] that is the only thing that can help us in our life you see whatever since god is out of faith what he has been doing from genesis until revelation is just uplifting the face of his own children whenever the devil and you know source another seed i never take away his children his face upon him hallelujah that is what he is going to do tonight for you he is going to uplift his hallelujah has reasons always [Music] what god has promised to you in your life tonight you have promised that you are expecting do you have hope do you have a promise do you have prophecy that you are expecting in your life tonight hold up on that word hallelujah let us go back to genesis chapter 22. hallelujah something is going on in the realms of the spirit [Music] amen hallelujah hallelujah and it came to pass after these things that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am our [Music] this is a temptation from god i want your attention now if you are passing through any temptation it might be from god himself sometimes he will put you into temptation what just happened in his past that was the blessing that abraham is there was much joy in their house oh my god did abraham received his blessing from god or not he received from god or not who gave him his son scientifically we cannot use they cannot be able to uh get birth science she was not able to bear a child naturally speaking scientifically messian but our topic tonight i want to i want i want you to see those blessings that you have received from god himself you yourself you know when i was german what kind [Music] of blessing is your that you have received from him hallelujah what if god himself comes again to don't forget our but you cannot topic again forget wisdom i'm against the gator hold the face and it came to pass after resisting that god did tempt abraham and said unto him abraham and he said behold here i am and he said take now thy son thy only sir isaac whom thou lovest and get thee into the land of mariah and offer him there for a burnett offering upon one of the mountains which i will tell the earth [Music] he comes with another high level of standards hallelujah it is another level of life whoa you you might be you might find this thing that it is too strong for you it will be too strong for me also after many years waiting and receiving that blessing [Music] so on uh verse 3 it says and abraham rose up early in the morning after he heard the voice of god early in the morning rose up and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and isaac his son and clav the wood for the burned offering and rose up and went under the place which god had told him then on the third day abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place of afar off and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lord we'll go yonder and worship and come again to you naturally hallelujah you see abraham his face didn't fade hallelujah most of us after we receive our blessing from the lord but we need always to increase our faith that's why every time when we think we are enough for when we think we are we have a big faith on our lord god comes with another temptation there is there are three steps that we learn from abraham's life what did abraham do abraham he took his two young men young [Music] i want you to catch up something there is a real evaluation here they have come together abraham [Music] which means me and my son will go yonder category on the mountain on the mountain and what we will do together i want to hear something what we will do whenever you are asked by jesus christ to offer the blessings that you have received previously whenever god asks you i request you to offer what has been bless you you don't [Music] [Applause] whatever he is doing in his life he knew that it is just worshipping of god yeah i see that so that's why if i'm going to yonder up on the mountain thing in my life amina she said [Music] after we worship he know that he is going to kill his own amen what did he say yeah we worship and wake up again together to marry to come including his son someone he knows that god can create even another man amen we will go on that and worship together to see and come again to you tomorrow to commemorate your movie tell the devil whatever you have sacrificed for the lord hallelujah this is the first step that we can see from life of abraham okay what is the second step let us go to the first seven category let us took verse seven or okay let us read from verse 6 and abraham took the wood off the burnet offering and laid it up on isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went to both of them together isaac does not know that this even fire this wood everything that has been prepared to sacrifice a permanent offering maybe some kind of ship that is what he has been seeing during his when he has been grown up with abraham there is no possible way that the isaac will think that his father will sacrifice him or offer him of them together on your room here is a question that comes arise here is a voice that you need to answer back and he will come back they god will provide does abraham know that god has prepared a lamp on the mountain but he is a seed of god what is the situation he's in a situation where he is going to lose or where he is he might lose his son yarimum in your situation tonight you say something in your situation tonight something that will create and manifest hallelujah [Music] i wonder isaac has learned you know that it is also a symbolic or it was a shadow for the comings of jesus christ and the father and son relationship isaac was representing jesus christ himself he hallelujah amen amen oh lord jesus christ help us tonight and they came to the place which god verse 9 had told him off and abraham built an altar there and led the wood in order and bound isaac his son and lied him on the altar upon the wood and abraham stretched force his hand and took the knife to slay his son this is the last step the third step okay be ready as long as you are not ready that uh lamp will not be provided for [Music] [Music] when god requested abraham as a bernie offering his own son god is not a foolish catholic and god does not break his principles let me show you something do you know that in the old testament or in any scripture there is no a man's sacrifice human sacrifice no human sacrifice god has never received amen hallelujah god is evil you understand me hallelujah amen hallelujah ah that is mighty he's all knowing god god don't now now he knows what he's doing in your life [Music] intentionally every who can be sacrificed for sin is jesus christ there is no righteous man who himself manifested in place that is jesus christ [Music] is the one who gathered us together [Music] to take your knife when you begin to slay your death what just happened the angel of the lord called unto there [Applause] [Music] [Music] now we see three outcomes of face of abrahams kathy [Music] [Music] to be [Music] amen that is the first outcomes of his face and what is the second outcomes of his face the seed shall process [Music] i can say to you tonight exactly enemies hallelujah sure not only possible of the gate of this your enemy but even because of you because of this all the nations of the [Music] other do you know that it is because of you over the money that your enemies are even blessed come again brother even your enemies never love evil will be blessed hallelujah amen as long as you are here you wanna they don't know what they are doing
