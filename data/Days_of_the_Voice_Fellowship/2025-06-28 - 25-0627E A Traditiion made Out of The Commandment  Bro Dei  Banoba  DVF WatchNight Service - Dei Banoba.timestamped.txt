[1:10:25] Tonight we're just having brother day
[1:10:27] come to minister to us. If brother day
[1:10:29] can come. Brother Day is the uh husband
[1:10:32] to uh sister. Is your name sister? Uh no
[1:10:36] not sister Sarah. Sister Sarah is the
[1:10:37] other one. Uh can you remind me your
[1:10:40] name? Sister
[1:10:43] Sister Deborah. Yes. Uh so sister
[1:10:45] Deborah has been with us for quite a
[1:10:47] while now. Uh maybe more than a year
[1:10:49] actually. So many of you know her. Can
[1:10:52] you raise up your hand so that Yeah,
[1:10:53] that's sister Deborah. Uh so uh she's
[1:10:56] been with us for for a while. And uh
[1:10:59] many of you don't know her husband. Her
[1:11:01] husband I think has been with us here uh
[1:11:03] for one or two services. uh but he's
[1:11:05] originally from um I don't know the
[1:11:08] district but uh in Busoga and then he
[1:11:10] moved uh here in Campala and he's been
[1:11:14] here in Kala for an extended period of
[1:11:16] time and so um by the day we first met I
[1:11:21] think um I first had an encounter with
[1:11:24] him I think I was introduced to him by
[1:11:26] brother she inve
[1:11:28] uh but I think he had been here before
[1:11:31] then and uh so I my my fellowship with
[1:11:35] him, I found him to be a good brother
[1:11:38] and uh one that really loves the Lord
[1:11:41] and I've never heard him minister
[1:11:42] before, but in my fellowship with him, I
[1:11:44] felt that it would be wonderful for us
[1:11:46] to get to hear from him and and to also
[1:11:49] tap the gift of God in his life. Amen.
[1:11:53] And uh so we pray for him as he
[1:11:56] ministers uh to us. He's um as I
[1:12:00] understand
[1:12:02] uh trying to start a fellowship in one
[1:12:04] of the areas um
[1:12:07] uh is it uh what's the name of the
[1:12:10] place?
[1:12:12] Yeah, n yeah starting a fellowship in
[1:12:15] those in those in those areas. Uh so
[1:12:18] we'll hear more about that maybe later
[1:12:20] after he has ministered. So let's u
[1:12:23] continue sing that song one or two more
[1:12:25] times and then by the day you just come
[1:12:26] right away. I don't is there?
[1:12:32] No. So we will if you're online and you
[1:12:35] need interpretation just type in the in
[1:12:38] the in the box there that you need
[1:12:39] interpretation then they can inform us
[1:12:42] otherwise we are going to go without
[1:12:43] interpretation tonight. Brother Langa is
[1:12:46] sec so it's understandable can excuse
[1:12:49] you for tonight. Amen. And uh then also
[1:12:52] a few brethren have traveled and others
[1:12:54] working in Oh brother Langa is here.
[1:12:56] Nice to see you. I didn't expect you
[1:12:58] tonight. You're really struggling. God
[1:13:00] bless you so much. And uh so also
[1:13:03] brother uh Joel uh you noticed even on
[1:13:07] Wednesday he was not here. He is working
[1:13:10] way up in the east. I think he he went
[1:13:12] up to um he was in Yanga and then from I
[1:13:16] think he went to another district. So we
[1:13:18] just remember him in prayers and uh but
[1:13:21] the Martin has also been working in
[1:13:23] Mitana for quite some time now. He's
[1:13:24] been helping the church in Mitana to tie
[1:13:26] up um uh the the sanctuary, part of the
[1:13:30] sanctuary. So I think by now he should
[1:13:33] either be done or getting done. So um
[1:13:38] let's remember those believers in
[1:13:40] prayers. Amen. Let us sing that one more
[1:13:42] time as as our brother day comes. Amen.

[1:15:06] My life is not my own.
[1:15:10] To you I belong.
[1:15:15] I give myself.
[1:15:18] I give myself to you.
[1:15:23] My life is not my own.
[1:15:28] You
[1:15:30] belong.
[1:15:33] I give myself
[1:15:35] I give myself to you.
[1:15:40] Let's give the Lord a hand of praising.
[1:15:43] [Music]
[1:15:47] You may have your seats farewell.
[1:15:52] I greet you all in the precious name of
[1:15:55] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:15:58] And I I count this to be a very big
[1:16:00] privilege
[1:16:02] for the opportunity given to me also to
[1:16:04] stand before you the sense of the most
[1:16:06] high.
[1:16:09] I think pastor has already introduced me
[1:16:12] but I can again introduce myself
[1:16:15] because he has mentioned one name only.
[1:16:19] I'm brother day.
[1:16:22] I'm Austria minister of the gospel.
[1:16:25] I'm from Ubusa
[1:16:27] Cami district
[1:16:30] but he
[1:16:32] by the grace of the Lord Lord took me
[1:16:34] from there and he brought me this side
[1:16:37] and for two years I've been staying in
[1:16:39] Campala
[1:16:41] by the time we came to Campala I came to
[1:16:43] Campala my family was staying in Ukoto
[1:16:48] and then later alone we shifted to of
[1:16:51] course as we are staying in Ukoto the
[1:16:54] nearest fellowship was the koa church
[1:16:56] chand pastor Steven so we joined him and
[1:17:00] started fellowshipping with that church
[1:17:04] and uh I've been also ministering there
[1:17:08] many many times by the grace of the lord
[1:17:11] until late alone we shifted to way
[1:17:14] and when we shifted to we were having a
[1:17:17] little kid so my wife could not manage
[1:17:21] traveling that far distance and I
[1:17:25] personally I could manage. So for them I
[1:17:28] send them this side and that's the
[1:17:30] reason why they have been fellow from
[1:17:32] here for like a year.
[1:17:36] I want to thank the pastor of this
[1:17:38] place, pastor.
[1:17:40] I first met him when I was ina.
[1:17:43] I remember some good years back I think
[1:17:45] three four years and then but we did not
[1:17:49] have any conversation. Of course I did
[1:17:52] not get connected to him though he
[1:17:55] shared his contact also with us together
[1:17:58] with me also but ever since I did not
[1:18:01] communicate with him until when we meet
[1:18:04] in TV. It was one day I was at my
[1:18:07] workplace in then I received a call
[1:18:10] looking at it was brother B. I asked
[1:18:14] myself what is brother B telling me and
[1:18:16] where did he got my number? Then
[1:18:20] realizing later I was brother she who
[1:18:23] was with him. So they we are
[1:18:26] communicating with me for a business
[1:18:29] cases
[1:18:30] and later on we get we got into
[1:18:34] touch until today we've been friends
[1:18:37] with brother Bas.
[1:18:40] You are blessed with a minister
[1:18:43] who is nice. If I if I speak about nice,
[1:18:47] it is not nice in the appearance but is
[1:18:50] nice inside him.
[1:18:53] I came to realize that is having a nice
[1:18:56] spirit in him.
[1:18:58] I've been talking about this many times
[1:19:00] and with different brothers like brother
[1:19:03] Julius I was telling I brother Julius of
[1:19:07] I was telling brother Julius that I came
[1:19:08] to rec to realize that brother bus is
[1:19:12] one of the brothers having sweet spirit
[1:19:15] in them so you are blessed with that
[1:19:18] kind of a man of God.
[1:19:22] I thank God
[1:19:24] uh for this opportunity and uh I believe
[1:19:29] God will surely bless us. I've been
[1:19:32] ministering in many places.
[1:19:35] Uh brother Ranga you know Ranga but I
[1:19:38] don't know whether he remembers me.
[1:19:41] I I was with him ina when he had gone he
[1:19:45] had come for the introduction of my
[1:19:47] little sister and he was the MC
[1:19:51] brother Joseph of
[1:19:54] so brother Rang I've been knowing him
[1:19:56] for long
[1:19:58] of course before even that day I've been
[1:20:01] I had already known him before but again
[1:20:06] I'm glad to see you and uh I respect
[1:20:09] everyone I respect the ministers of this
[1:20:11] place. I believe they have been a
[1:20:15] blessing to us. I always follow your

[1:20:37] What is that place? Choga. My wife can
[1:20:39] remind me. It is Chiboga. They called me
[1:20:42] from Chiboga. They having I I think it

[1:20:54] that that service and by the grace of
[1:20:57] the Lord after here I'll travel to

[1:26:46] Oh,
[1:26:52] let's pray.
[1:26:54] Let us bow our heads and we pray.
[1:26:57] Precious loving heavenly father, king of
[1:27:00] kings, son, lord of lords, we want to
[1:27:03] appreciate you for this moment, father,
[1:27:05] whereby you've brought us together under
[1:27:07] the roof of thy house where you chose to
[1:27:10] put your name in. Father, I want to
[1:27:13] thank you for this privilege which is
[1:27:15] given to us to come at thy table.
[1:27:18] Father, we are all of us, we are under
[1:27:21] great expectation,
[1:27:23] not expecting to receive from any man,
[1:27:26] but to expecting to receive from thee,
[1:27:29] our Lord, our savior. Father, we know
[1:27:32] you are the all shai, the Lord that
[1:27:35] feeds. May you feed us, oh Lord, by your
[1:27:38] word in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:27:40] Father, we just commit this session into
[1:27:42] your hand as you've been with us from
[1:27:45] the beginning. Father, I pray that you
[1:27:47] continue to be with us more especially
[1:27:50] in this session of the word. May you
[1:27:52] come and take preminence. Oh God, may
[1:27:55] you come and bless us. Almighty Lord,
[1:27:58] may you come and touch upon each and
[1:28:00] everyone that has come and enter the
[1:28:02] guest of this temple. Father, even them
[1:28:05] that are online, Father, may you touch
[1:28:07] upon them in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:28:09] I commit the word into your hand,
[1:28:11] Father, as it will be going forth. Lord,
[1:28:15] let thy word be a bleeding word whereby
[1:28:18] it will be like the blood washing away
[1:28:21] our sins, cleansing us and taking away
[1:28:25] all the unrighteousness from us in the
[1:28:27] name of Jesus. May you, Father, unveil
[1:28:30] yourself before us. Speak to each soul
[1:28:33] that has come in thy house. Father, may
[1:28:36] you meet everyone, Father. And as you've
[1:28:40] made me to be a blessing to many and in
[1:28:43] different places I have gone to Father I
[1:28:46] pray that you do the same today grant a
[1:28:49] wonderful address to me in the name of
[1:28:52] Jesus as thy word will be going forth
[1:28:55] let there be a manifestation of the word
[1:28:57] of God because we don't serve an infido
[1:29:01] God but we serve a living God. Father,
[1:29:04] may you heal that sick, deliver the
[1:29:05] captive, touch them that touch upon them
[1:29:08] that are in bondage by the power of the
[1:29:10] Holy Ghost. May your anointing break
[1:29:13] every yoke, Father, that has been
[1:29:16] bounding thy people in the mighty name
[1:29:18] of Jesus. I declare healing and
[1:29:21] deliverance upon each and everyone who
[1:29:24] is airing this word. Father, will not
[1:29:27] remain the same in the name of Jesus. I
[1:29:31] pray that you use me. You have your own
[1:29:33] way through me in the mighty name of the
[1:29:36] Lord Jesus Christ my Lord and Savior I
[1:29:38] pray. Amen.
[1:29:43] uh straight away we shall go to the
[1:29:45] reading of the scripture
[1:29:48] but the pastor said we shall just use
[1:29:51] one language
[1:29:53] but but I have some few people that I'm
[1:29:58] expecting them to be following and some
[1:30:01] of them they may not
[1:30:04] catch up with us because of the language
[1:30:09] so I request If possible,
[1:30:14] we get one to interpret me. God richly
[1:30:18] bless you. Straight away, let's go to
[1:30:22] the book of Isaiah, chapter one. I'm
[1:30:25] going to read a common scripture.
[1:30:33] We shall read from the 11th verse
[1:30:37] to the 15th verse.
[1:30:46] Isaiah 1 verse verse 11.
[1:30:50] [Music]
[1:30:53] It is a very common scripture
[1:31:02] actually
[1:31:04] for the best for the good basis. Let us
[1:31:06] read from verse 9.
[1:31:11] [Music]
[1:31:12] I have my English version here. He says,
[1:31:16] "Except the Lord of hosts left unto us a
[1:31:21] very small remnant, we should have been
[1:31:24] as Sodom and we should have been like
[1:31:28] onto Gula. Hear the word of the Lord. Ye
[1:31:31] rulers of Sodom, give ear unto the law
[1:31:34] of our God. Y people of Gula." Now the
[1:31:38] 11 is to what purpose is the multitude
[1:31:41] of your sacrifice unto me says the Lord.
[1:31:44] I am full of the burnt offerings of rams
[1:31:48] and the fat of the feed beasts and I let
[1:31:51] not in the blood of the blocks the blood
[1:31:54] of blocks or of the lambs or of he
[1:31:58] goats. When ye come to appear before me,
[1:32:02] who has required this at your hand to
[1:32:05] trend my course? Bring no more vine
[1:32:09] operations. Incest is an abnomination
[1:32:13] onto me. The new moons and Sabbath, the
[1:32:16] calling of assemblies I can I cannot
[1:32:20] away with. It is iniquity. Even in even
[1:32:25] the solommon meeting your new monus and
[1:32:29] your appointed feast my soul hateth.
[1:32:33] They are a trouble onto me. I am weary
[1:32:36] to bear them.
[1:32:39] And when you spread forth your hands
[1:32:41] shall hide mine ears and
[1:32:46] my ears from you. Yeah, when you make
[1:32:50] many prayers I will not hear. Your hands
[1:32:52] are full of blood. Wash you, make you
[1:32:56] clean, put away the evil of your doings
[1:32:59] from before mine eyes. Cease to do evil,
[1:33:03] learn to do well, seek judgment, relieve
[1:33:06] the oppressed, judge the fatherless,
[1:33:09] pray for the widow.
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:17] Fore!
[1:33:28] Foreign! Foreign!
[1:33:51] Soch.
[1:33:52] [Music]
[1:34:07] foreign
[1:34:13] [Music]
[1:34:28] [Music]
[1:34:31] speech.
[1:34:47] Foreign
[1:34:57] speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech.
[1:35:07] Fore
[1:35:12] [Music]
[1:35:28] speech.
[1:35:45] might the Lord add a blessing to the
[1:35:47] reading of the scripture.
[1:35:50] You might take your seats.
[1:35:53] Yeah. As I've said earlier,
[1:35:56] it is a common scripture
[1:35:59] and I believe each of us has ever come
[1:36:02] across that scripture
[1:36:07] and uh I try to to to come with another
[1:36:12] subject
[1:36:16] but the Lord refused that
[1:36:19] he placed that message on my heart.
[1:36:24] And I don't know why,
[1:36:26] but I believe God will bless us through
[1:36:28] that.
[1:36:31] Amen. Of course, I know you already
[1:36:33] disappointed
[1:36:36] of the t of the because of the scripture
[1:36:38] I've read,
[1:36:40] but I've ever used it inside
[1:36:46] and it becomes a blessing
[1:36:48] and I believe it will be a blessing.
[1:36:51] Hallelujah. Amen. I've ever used it.
[1:36:55] Of course, it is a good scripture
[1:36:59] to be used in evangelism,
[1:37:02] but still today we're going to use it
[1:37:04] here.
[1:37:06] Of course, where we've read
[1:37:09] that was prophet Isaiah.
[1:37:13] And prophet Isaiah, we know him.
[1:37:16] He was one of the major prophets in the
[1:37:19] in the Old Testament.
[1:37:22] that God sent to the children of Israel.
[1:37:27] Of course, there are there are
[1:37:28] prophecies that we call major prophet
[1:37:32] and they are minor prophet.
[1:37:35] Amen. So, prophet Isaiah was one of the
[1:37:39] major prophet in the Bible
[1:37:43] and the major prophet
[1:37:45] God sent him
[1:37:47] when there is a need.
[1:37:50] Amen. Amen. God can't send a major
[1:37:52] prophet
[1:37:54] unless his people has turned his word
[1:37:57] upside down.
[1:38:00] Then God does something about it.
[1:38:04] It is when they when people of God
[1:38:08] has turned the word of God
[1:38:12] upside down, then God has got to do
[1:38:15] something about it.
[1:38:18] So it was during that time
[1:38:20] When the children of Israel
[1:38:23] had turned his word upside down,
[1:38:26] God had to do something about it.
[1:38:29] Just like in our day, God sent us a
[1:38:33] prophet, God sent us a messenger.
[1:38:37] Why? The church has done his word upside
[1:38:40] down.
[1:38:42] And God did not leave the church just
[1:38:44] anyhow.
[1:38:46] We had to do something about it.
[1:38:49] God can't take a man at a judgment
[1:38:52] unless he first won the man. Praise God.
[1:38:56] God can do nothing except he first
[1:39:00] reveal it to his prophets the servants.
[1:39:04] Hallelujah. So you had to send a prophet
[1:39:07] Isaiah
[1:39:09] in our day. You had to send
[1:39:12] the prophet the prophet to restore
[1:39:17] the word of God
[1:39:19] of the church.
[1:39:22] The church had turned his word upside
[1:39:25] down
[1:39:27] and God did not just leave eternal
[1:39:31] to do something about it.
[1:39:34] Then he brought forth the prophet
[1:39:37] and he restored
[1:39:39] the word of God and we are blessed
[1:39:43] and we share that passion with him. We
[1:39:46] are blessed people. We are blessed
[1:39:48] people. God has sent a prophet to us.
[1:39:52] Hallelujah.
[1:39:54] by way. And now and now when the
[1:39:57] children of Israel
[1:39:59] had turned his word upside down
[1:40:04] and Isaiah came on came forth on the
[1:40:07] scene and he started rebuking them.
[1:40:12] Hallelujah. Started rebuking them. I
[1:40:15] said to you people, God is tired of your
[1:40:18] sacrifices.
[1:40:20] God is tired of all the things that you
[1:40:23] do.
[1:40:24] He's tired of your moon. He's tired of
[1:40:27] your
[1:40:29] is tired. And he said even that he who
[1:40:34] commanded you
[1:40:36] when you appear in my court
[1:40:40] come with things. He said oblation is an
[1:40:44] abnomination.
[1:40:46] He said
[1:40:48] operation is oblation is
[1:40:52] an incases. Yes.
[1:40:56] An abnomination to me. And now listen
[1:41:03] the commandments of God
[1:41:06] that God again came down and rebooked
[1:41:09] them. Why? Because they had made
[1:41:13] tradition out of his family.
[1:41:16] And I want to borrow my heading today. A
[1:41:19] tradition made out of a commandment.
[1:41:26] Hallelujah. A tradition made out of a
[1:41:29] commandment.
[1:41:32] So when prophet Isaiah came,
[1:41:36] he stripped them.
[1:41:38] He said,
[1:41:40] [Music]
[1:41:42] "God has refused.
[1:41:45] He said it is become a stink in his
[1:41:47] nostril.
[1:41:50] Here in the message all things
[1:41:54] paragraph 81
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:57] said
[1:41:59] it he said it has become a stink in his
[1:42:03] notion.
[1:42:05] What was it?
[1:42:08] The feast that God ordained them to do.
[1:42:14] The very feast that God ordained them to
[1:42:16] do.
[1:42:19] things that God ordained them to do.
[1:42:22] These are the commandments of God.
[1:42:25] In other words, I want to tell you they
[1:42:28] are doing the right thing.
[1:42:32] Amen. Because it was a commandment.
[1:42:37] Hallelujah. They did the ordinations
[1:42:40] that God them to do.
[1:42:43] the new moons,
[1:42:45] the Sabbath,
[1:42:48] offerings of sin offerings
[1:42:51] and so forth that God had made for to to
[1:42:55] that that God had given to Israel.
[1:42:59] But they had made a tradition out of it.
[1:43:04] That's right.
[1:43:07] Hallelujah.
[1:43:08] They had made a tradition out of it.
[1:43:14] And God
[1:43:16] did not tolerate a tradition.
[1:43:19] But God sent them prophet Isaiah
[1:43:23] and he pulled he pulled no patches.
[1:43:30] He told them what they had done.
[1:43:34] You can read from Isaiah chapter one.
[1:43:37] you go home.
[1:43:39] I'm quoting
[1:43:41] listen and the prophet preached that
[1:43:45] he told them that he was a stick
[1:43:49] in his nose. In other words, God did not
[1:43:52] want their sticking sacrifices
[1:43:56] a sacrifice that they were giving.
[1:44:00] What had they done? They had polluted
[1:44:03] their sacrifice.
[1:44:06] They had polluted it because they had
[1:44:10] entered into it
[1:44:12] without sincerity.
[1:44:16] So they were not getting any result.
[1:44:22] Praise God. They were doing the right
[1:44:25] thing.
[1:44:27] Their feast was righting
[1:44:31] moon was all right.
[1:44:35] sin offering was all right
[1:44:39] but they could come without sincerity
[1:44:44] and such sacrifices God rejects
[1:44:49] and such sacrifices God rejects.
[1:44:55] Praise God.
[1:44:57] Let me tell you, brother said that upon
[1:45:01] every sacrifice,
[1:45:03] God requires sincity.
[1:45:08] Upon every sacrifice,
[1:45:11] God requires sincerity
[1:45:14] in the message of
[1:45:19] he said that if God is just
[1:45:23] and he just requires sacrifice,
[1:45:27] It just requires faith.
[1:45:29] It just requires membership.
[1:45:32] Membership
[1:45:34] membership of the church.
[1:45:41] If he just requires membership,
[1:45:47] if he just wanted
[1:45:49] sacrifice, then God is unjust.
[1:45:54] When he condemned
[1:46:00] Because a believer
[1:46:03] was aer
[1:46:09] sacrifices
[1:46:11] and he worshiped him
[1:46:14] said he knelt down even
[1:46:18] but God rejected him.
[1:46:21] Why?
[1:46:23] He was fundamental.
[1:46:27] just
[1:46:30] he knew things by
[1:46:33] and he was not sincere
[1:46:36] to sincere people. God reveals himself
[1:46:39] to them
[1:46:42] and God reveal
[1:46:48] God. Hallelujah.
[1:46:52] So God
[1:46:53] requires sincity
[1:46:56] upon every sacrifice.
[1:47:00] Hallelujah.
[1:47:01] God requires sincerity.
[1:47:05] So they had polluted their sacrifices.
[1:47:09] Remember let me take you back
[1:47:12] in the day after God had just gave them
[1:47:14] these commandments.
[1:47:18] People were sincere.
[1:47:20] The children of Israel were sincere.
[1:47:23] They could come with their off with
[1:47:25] their sacrifice
[1:47:28] with a sincere heart.
[1:47:31] Malach said
[1:47:35] brother said
[1:47:37] sometimes I call him brother
[1:47:42] that they could come for instance a
[1:47:45] sinner
[1:47:47] could come with his sin sacrifice.
[1:47:51] and bring it to the priest
[1:47:54] and tell the priest, "Do you I I I I
[1:47:58] sinned and this is my sacrifice." And
[1:48:01] they could use and if the priest could
[1:48:03] get a sacrifice
[1:48:05] and and sacrifice it
[1:48:09] maybe
[1:48:11] slew it while the sinner is laying his
[1:48:15] hand upon that sacrifice
[1:48:18] with that feeling in his heart
[1:48:24] a soul of sin.
[1:48:28] Oh I was supposed to die like this lamb.
[1:48:33] that God is accepting the substituting
[1:48:43] the
[1:48:45] priest is sacrificing
[1:48:48] and then the the sinner
[1:48:51] is in that kind of feeling
[1:48:53] and the life of the lamb,
[1:48:57] the life of the sacrifice
[1:49:00] which was worth to to be to be a living
[1:49:04] comes in the washer
[1:49:07] comes in the sinner and then the life of
[1:49:10] the sinner
[1:49:11] the life which was worth to die
[1:49:14] into that sacrifice and the sacrifice
[1:49:17] died and God accepts their sacrifice
[1:49:22] but later alone they got used of their
[1:49:25] sacrifice
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:28] of the commandment of God
[1:49:31] could sin maybe on Tuesday
[1:49:35] and he's not caring about it and maybe
[1:49:39] on Sabbath
[1:49:42] he just get his lamb
[1:49:44] maybe just remember when he's going to
[1:49:46] church tomorrow
[1:49:49] oh I sing on Tuesday now I need a
[1:49:53] sacrifice
[1:49:54] but I have my bull there
[1:49:57] and he get it and he brings visit the
[1:50:00] priest and the priest sacrifice.
[1:50:04] Well, he's just there arrogantly
[1:50:09] is arrogant.
[1:50:12] He's not caring. He's not feeling that
[1:50:16] pain of soul.
[1:50:19] the soul of of sin
[1:50:23] having it and in such sacrifices
[1:50:28] they can't they can't get any result of
[1:50:34] amen.
[1:50:36] Amen. Praise God.
[1:50:39] When it come to peace offerings
[1:50:45] in the Old Testament when it comes to
[1:50:47] peace offerings
[1:50:50] many
[1:50:52] standard living
[1:50:58] at a low standard of living
[1:51:02] to bring forth pigeon
[1:51:07] doves.
[1:51:09] Amen. And then people that were in the
[1:51:12] middle class,
[1:51:15] they bring in he got
[1:51:18] They bring lamb and those people that
[1:51:22] are high, those people that are high,
[1:51:26] they could bring in things like a cow.
[1:51:33] But time came,
[1:51:35] time came and a rich man just comes with
[1:51:40] a lamp.
[1:51:44] That's true. He just offer it anyhow.
[1:51:48] is not sincere
[1:51:51] to the people that are sincere.
[1:51:54] They do according to the word of God.
[1:51:59] Praise God. Hallelujah. And I want to
[1:52:03] tell you sometimes I wonder
[1:52:07] I meet people who are not sincere
[1:52:14] even when they are believers.
[1:52:18] But they are not sincere.
[1:52:20] So these people
[1:52:22] they could polluted their sacrifices
[1:52:26] because they had entered into it without
[1:52:29] sincerity.
[1:52:32] He said your tradition
[1:52:36] coming with their traditions.
[1:52:39] I taken the power out of the
[1:52:40] commandment.
[1:52:47] Hallelujah. Amen. As soon as they took
[1:52:50] the word of God to be a tradition,
[1:52:54] the power of God came out of the word
[1:52:59] because the tradition is powerless.
[1:53:03] A creed is powerless.
[1:53:06] Hallelujah.
[1:53:08] Is powerless.
[1:53:10] And the word of God is powerful.
[1:53:16] Praise God. Hallelujah. So listen.
[1:53:21] Oh church of God.
[1:53:24] You see what makes ministers heartbreak.
[1:53:29] What the Pentecost
[1:53:32] when the Pentecost that God gave us,
[1:53:37] we've made a tradition out of it.
[1:53:42] I'm quoting the society has fed from the
[1:53:47] church.
[1:53:50] I don't say all of them.
[1:53:53] I thank God.
[1:53:55] Wasn't all of them, but the majority
[1:54:00] has loed sincerity.
[1:54:06] Praise God.
[1:54:08] Majority
[1:54:10] has loed sinc.
[1:54:13] And brother said that's what makes
[1:54:16] minister's heart break.
[1:54:21] I always said this that one one one one
[1:54:26] member of the church
[1:54:29] to get converted
[1:54:32] it gives a joy to the minister.
[1:54:38] Amen. Amen. I can say like this that if
[1:54:44] someone
[1:54:45] gets an encounter with God
[1:54:49] and the minister realize it is true
[1:54:53] that one can really spark bring his
[1:54:56] heart spark
[1:55:02] praise God.
[1:55:04] Hallelujah.
[1:55:05] So they had they haded their sacrifice
[1:55:10] And we see that the same thing with us
[1:55:13] today.
[1:55:15] And he says we are ashamed of doing the
[1:55:17] same.
[1:55:20] We are guilt of doing the same thing.
[1:55:24] We make a form out of it.
[1:55:28] Yet it is the commandment of God.
[1:55:32] Let me first emphasize this.
[1:55:35] Just like many Christians,
[1:55:37] I just wake up in the morning, but now
[1:55:40] I'm going to church.
[1:55:43] Just come anyhow.
[1:55:49] One day I was I I remember it was
[1:55:52] somewhere
[1:55:54] and it was a morning. It was a Sunday
[1:55:56] morning.
[1:55:58] I spoke to a certain believer
[1:56:01] and pray and go to church
[1:56:03] and the believer told me already I'm
[1:56:06] going to church to pray.
[1:56:08] Why do I need to pray?
[1:56:16] And I marveled
[1:56:19] because
[1:56:20] I know people that comes when they in
[1:56:24] the spirit,
[1:56:26] they are the people that God blesses in
[1:56:28] the service.
[1:56:30] It reminds me in the days gone by,
[1:56:34] the days of the Lord Jesus Christ, the
[1:56:36] Bible speaks about a certain man,
[1:56:38] Simeon.
[1:56:41] And the Bible says Simeon came when he
[1:56:43] was in the spirit
[1:56:46] and he came to the temple. And when he
[1:56:49] reached the temple, he saw Mary
[1:56:53] useful.
[1:56:55] people had brought their children
[1:56:58] to do as it was the custom.
[1:57:01] And then
[1:57:03] when he came nearer,
[1:57:06] he saw Jesus and he asked Mary to give
[1:57:10] him the baby and said, "Oh, this baby
[1:57:15] has raised for the for the fall of many
[1:57:22] of."
[1:57:24] Hallelujah. Amen. He recognized the
[1:57:26] Messiah.
[1:57:28] He recognized the Messiah.
[1:57:31] Even when the priest did not recognize
[1:57:34] him,
[1:57:37] why he was in the spirit,
[1:57:40] he came with the church. When he was in
[1:57:43] the spirit,
[1:57:45] he was spirit enough.
[1:57:49] He was preaching now that he could
[1:57:52] realize the
[1:57:54] brother was saying in the message is
[1:57:57] there anything to be
[1:58:00] he said Abraham was in the right
[1:58:02] atmosphere
[1:58:04] when God and Gabriel met him
[1:58:10] and as he was in the right atmosphere
[1:58:13] after he had prayed through the night
[1:58:16] and then he was able
[1:58:19] to recognize
[1:58:21] God that he was not just a man.
[1:58:27] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:32] Hallelujah. Praise God. He was able to
[1:58:36] recognize
[1:58:38] that this is not just visual.
[1:58:50] Says the prophet
[1:58:53] says the prophet says the prophet.
[1:58:56] Hallelujah. But here you find a believer
[1:59:00] just come to church anyway
[1:59:03] and when they come to church I told them
[1:59:05] to worship
[1:59:07] at least I've I've ever been here
[1:59:12] and I'm really blessed
[1:59:15] and I'm so happy
[1:59:18] that at least your worship
[1:59:22] has life in it
[1:59:27] has life in it. But I've gone to
[1:59:30] churches
[1:59:31] and they worship has no life.
[1:59:35] They tell people to worship.
[1:59:38] They just looking around.
[1:59:41] Tell them that we are now praying.
[1:59:45] Let's close our heads.
[1:59:47] People are busy looking.
[1:59:54] I've seen them sometimes when the
[1:59:56] Spanish
[1:59:59] they want to let us know that oh
[2:00:01] something has happened
[2:00:04] why they are looking around they
[2:00:08] say
[2:00:13] one time I was praying for certain kid
[2:00:16] who was sick
[2:00:19] was in in a hospital
[2:00:22] she was a girl actually she called
[2:00:23] Esther,
[2:00:25] very younger baby and her mouth has
[2:00:28] become just together.
[2:00:31] She could not open her mouth. The
[2:00:34] doctors could not do anything about it.
[2:00:37] I had failed it
[2:00:40] and I said when I went there
[2:00:44] it was just she was at the oxygen
[2:00:49] and then I requested the doctors to give
[2:00:52] me the loom
[2:00:54] because the oxygen looms for those
[2:00:56] children
[2:01:01] they don't allow more than one tender
[2:01:06] but I requested them.
[2:01:08] They first asked me, "Pastor, we failed.
[2:01:12] Will you manage it?" I told them, "Yeah,
[2:01:15] I've come. But I'm not going to manage
[2:01:18] it." God is going to manage it.
[2:01:24] And when I went, I to give me the war
[2:01:29] and I brought I brought people in.
[2:01:33] I first broke their
[2:01:36] their laws.
[2:01:40] I made the place to be a church.
[2:01:44] Put people in. I started sharing the
[2:01:47] word.
[2:01:49] Then I I told them let's pray.
[2:01:52] Start praying. Start praying. As I was
[2:01:55] praying, I heard someone say, "Oh, mama
[2:02:05] then I realized something has happened
[2:02:08] by those people that looks
[2:02:13] you them to close the eyes.
[2:02:19] I've just started feeling you now.
[2:02:22] [Laughter]
[2:02:25] You tell them close the eyes
[2:02:28] and for them they are looking around
[2:02:35] and you wonder
[2:02:37] and such people are in churches also.
[2:02:42] They tell them to pray and they are
[2:02:45] looking around.
[2:02:47] If they pray they will just speak some
[2:02:49] little words they are done.
[2:02:53] Ah and they look around. I saw people
[2:02:57] start marveling about others.
[2:03:01] Where did these people get words?
[2:03:06] It is you the problem.
[2:03:12] Praise God. It is you the problem.
[2:03:17] If you just want penetrate.
[2:03:21] ah things will change.
[2:03:24] Praise God. Brother said in the message
[2:03:28] going beyond the camp
[2:03:31] he said he was told
[2:03:33] that an airplane can't do what it is in
[2:03:38] it
[2:03:40] unless it goes beyond its sound
[2:03:42] barriers.
[2:03:46] But when it goes beyond it sound
[2:03:48] barriers
[2:03:55] will do what made for it to do
[2:04:01] say it is the same thing to a man of God
[2:04:06] to the children of God
[2:04:08] but they penetrates
[2:04:10] and God
[2:04:14] they can do what is in them
[2:04:18] where they are able
[2:04:20] they are able to do what is in them.
[2:04:24] They are able to overcome sin.
[2:04:27] They are able to pray
[2:04:30] to pray.
[2:04:34] They are able to worship.
[2:04:37] They are able to do whatever.
[2:04:46] Praise God. Hallelujah. But people
[2:04:51] you find them
[2:04:53] let's close their eyes. They are looking
[2:04:56] around.
[2:05:00] They want to say exactly what will
[2:05:02] happen.
[2:05:08] How will that miracle happen?
[2:05:15] We've gotCC enough.
[2:05:19] Hallelujah. When it comes to time of
[2:05:22] offering,
[2:05:24] you find a believer who has got
[2:05:26] something
[2:05:28] in the pocket, he contributes 20
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:35] and in the old time I've told you
[2:05:38] in the old testament
[2:05:40] people at a low level of
[2:05:43] they could bring pigeons,
[2:05:46] dove
[2:05:48] And then the middle the middle class
[2:05:53] and he goes
[2:05:56] and then those who are fine
[2:06:00] for them there.
[2:06:03] They are to bring blocks
[2:06:10] but I find a believer.
[2:06:13] One time I was in a meeting
[2:06:15] in a church
[2:06:18] And then brother who was at least
[2:06:20] ableuting
[2:06:27] piano
[2:06:29] was at least you could say
[2:06:33] they contributed 20.
[2:06:36] Yeah.
[2:06:39] And you may tell me such kind of people
[2:06:41] are they sincere?
[2:06:46] They giving with sincerity
[2:06:51] when it comes to tithing.
[2:06:55] Oh dear.
[2:06:58] [Music]
[2:07:00] A believer can get one M.
[2:07:04] I now culturate
[2:07:06] one M. I heard of a certain sister
[2:07:11] in a certain place.
[2:07:13] She got 5 million one deal 5 million
[2:07:18] or six million I don't know but the
[2:07:21] sister was faithful
[2:07:24] she got the tithe she took it to the
[2:07:26] pastor
[2:07:28] I wondered I said will he such believers
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:34] but others will first calculate
[2:07:39] if I give him 300 something
[2:07:44] It is enough.
[2:07:53] We also have needs. Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:07:56] We've got to be sincere.
[2:07:59] If we are to get resources out of our
[2:08:01] sacrifices,
[2:08:05] we've got to be sincere.
[2:08:09] So brothers, they had polluted their
[2:08:11] sacrifices.
[2:08:14] because they could enter into worship
[2:08:16] without sincerity.
[2:08:20] Hallelujah. And now today
[2:08:23] our tradition is taking the power out of
[2:08:26] our worship.
[2:08:31] This is the prophet
[2:08:34] by our own tradition
[2:08:37] and we say
[2:08:39] that means Methodist. Methodist that
[2:08:42] means Baptist Baptist that's
[2:08:46] Pentecostals
[2:08:48] that's all of us together.
[2:08:54] Hallelujah.
[2:08:56] Your tradition has lost its power
[2:09:00] [Music]
[2:09:02] not because you did not do it
[2:09:07] but you did it without sincerity.
[2:09:16] Hallelujah.
[2:09:18] Yes, you've come to the church.
[2:09:20] Yes, you've come for for an overnight
[2:09:24] finite prayer.
[2:09:26] But if you are not sincere
[2:09:30] inside you feeling that kind of feeling
[2:09:34] that I'm going to meet God, even the
[2:09:37] Bible say, "Amen." Amen.
[2:09:40] that faith
[2:09:43] without faith it is impossible to
[2:09:45] believe to to to
[2:09:48] please praise God.
[2:09:50] The Bible said them that comes to the
[2:09:53] Lord
[2:09:55] must believe
[2:09:58] must know
[2:10:00] that their God is the reward that them
[2:10:03] that droently seek him.
[2:10:09] You must feel that my God
[2:10:13] is my reward.
[2:10:16] As I'm going for the service,
[2:10:18] he will reward me. He will bless me,
[2:10:22] will meet my need, will meet my problem.
[2:10:26] He's going to heal me, brothers,
[2:10:28] sisters,
[2:10:30] is the condition of the heart that makes
[2:10:33] the difference.
[2:10:37] Brother said,
[2:10:39] as he was talking about the men that
[2:10:41] were that received the baptism of the
[2:10:42] Holy Ghost
[2:10:44] before even the water baptism
[2:10:48] that is acts
[2:10:50] 10:44
[2:10:54] said it depended on the condition of
[2:10:57] their heart
[2:11:00] and God said oh
[2:11:03] his people let me them even before the
[2:11:07] water baptist

[2:11:32] Hallelujah. We've got to make the outer
[2:11:35] right.

[2:12:26] region

[2:14:01] Brother said, "If David of the old time
[2:14:06] who was there before the the before the
[2:14:10] day of the of Pentecost,
[2:14:13] his cup runth over.
[2:14:18] If
[2:14:19] over,
[2:14:21] how much more shall it be
[2:14:24] with us? who has come after the Pentec
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:44] that that when the Pentecost that he
[2:14:47] gave us,
[2:14:50] he we've made a tradition out of it.
[2:14:55] Hallelujah.
[2:14:57] We've made a tradition out.
[2:15:02] We've made a tradition out of of the
[2:15:05] Pentecost church.
[2:15:08] No real sincerity.
[2:15:12] No real soul for sin.
[2:15:16] People come up
[2:15:18] out
[2:15:20] and many of them take a lot of music
[2:15:25] and a lot of dancing
[2:15:27] and clapping hands
[2:15:31] just like that.
[2:15:38] No real sincerity,
[2:15:41] no real soul for sin.
[2:15:45] I've seen believers who come for at the
[2:15:47] outer
[2:15:51] actually those believers they come when
[2:15:53] they go after they had got them
[2:15:56] they come after them.
[2:16:01] Amen.
[2:16:03] Then they come
[2:16:05] and has come to confess his sin. His sin
[2:16:09] he knows it.
[2:16:11] But when you call him
[2:16:14] Oh
[2:16:16] come here and laugh
[2:16:22] my I pray God forgive me
[2:16:26] and you also forgive me.
[2:16:31] [Music]
[2:16:34] Hallelujah. Amen. nor your soul for sin.
[2:16:42] Such sacrifices
[2:16:45] there is no result.
[2:16:48] Brother was saying
[2:16:50] confessed sin.
[2:16:53] God does not forget forgive
[2:16:56] and dry eye confession.
[2:17:04] God does not forgive.
[2:17:08] A dry eye confession.
[2:17:13] God does not forgive.
[2:17:16] There must be some soul.
[2:17:21] [Applause]
[2:17:23] But we've made a tradition out of the
[2:17:25] commandment of God.
[2:17:27] And I believe we are guilt of doing the
[2:17:31] same.
[2:17:33] Brothers, sisters, we are living in a
[2:17:36] day where people has got tradition out
[2:17:41] has made up tradition out of the word of
[2:17:42] God.
[2:17:44] But there some are just there
[2:17:49] not sincere not sincere.
[2:17:52] But there is somebody
[2:17:54] sincere in that.
[2:17:57] There is somebody got a genuine reason.
[2:18:02] [Music]
[2:18:03] Because he entered into it
[2:18:07] sincerely
[2:18:09] upon the bes of his face
[2:18:14] in the shed blood
[2:18:17] get the results
[2:18:23] people got results out of this.
[2:18:28] I have seen people who God touch upon
[2:18:33] who God meets.
[2:18:36] I know
[2:18:39] some believer does not believe in other
[2:18:40] things
[2:18:43] because they had made traditions.
[2:18:48] You find a church does not believe in
[2:18:53] in
[2:18:55] move of the Holy Ghost.
[2:18:59] If they see that, oh,
[2:19:03] those are Pentecostals.
[2:19:09] What a tradition.
[2:19:15] Oh,
[2:19:17] is a Pentecostal.
[2:19:20] You see, let me
[2:19:23] You see, let me tell you, I've grew up
[2:19:26] under this message
[2:19:28] and I have seen things
[2:19:31] that marvels my heart.
[2:19:36] Hallelujah. We grew up
[2:19:40] seeing churches lukewarm.
[2:19:44] They are just there.
[2:19:46] No real
[2:19:50] just sing these songs
[2:19:53] from the song book slowly.
[2:19:57] There is no difference
[2:20:00] in between them and methodist
[2:20:04] and we grew up thinking that that was
[2:20:06] message of the hour.
[2:20:10] We thought
[2:20:12] it that was the message of the hour.
[2:20:17] We used to think the message of the hour
[2:20:21] end is there.
[2:20:28] I just a song comes
[2:20:32] sing
[2:20:34] because the pastor the pastor preaches
[2:20:37] you offer prayer
[2:20:40] closing prayer
[2:20:43] you are dismissed.
[2:20:47] No real move of the Holy Ghost.
[2:20:51] your wash
[2:20:54] and in such churches
[2:20:57] you find no power of God there.
[2:21:00] Yes, there are message churches
[2:21:03] but there is no power of God. There is
[2:21:06] no move of God and we are not ministers
[2:21:10] of letter.
[2:21:12] We are not ministers of letter.
[2:21:15] We are ministers of the spirit of God.
[2:21:18] So the letter kills
[2:21:21] By the spirit gives life.
[2:21:24] I'm not a minister of the letter. You
[2:21:26] are free to choose
[2:21:29] the minister of letter. I'm not that
[2:21:31] kind of minister.
[2:21:33] Minister of the spirit. Whatever been
[2:21:36] preaching whatever been ministering.
[2:21:40] I've seen the demonstration of the power
[2:21:42] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:21:44] People being slow down.
[2:21:48] Amen. And now there
[2:21:53] he believes in those things.
[2:21:59] Now that one is a Pentecost.
[2:22:02] If if you want quotes, I can give them
[2:22:04] to you. Brother Abraham himself saying
[2:22:09] that the Holy Ghost is here and the
[2:22:12] evidence of that he's here. I can see
[2:22:15] people speaking in tong. I can see
[2:22:17] people being slayed by the Holy Ghost.
[2:22:24] How can you take away that quote?
[2:22:29] Let me tell you, by our traditions,
[2:22:34] we've made this word of God
[2:22:37] to be powerless.
[2:22:41] We grew up thinking that that was what
[2:22:44] message mean.
[2:22:46] That was the meaning of the message.
[2:22:49] We are supposed to be humble
[2:22:55] just like the Catholic priest.
[2:22:58] [Music]
[2:23:01] But let me tell you brothers when I came
[2:23:04] at my age
[2:23:06] and started reading the message
[2:23:09] and God gave me a personal experience
[2:23:11] with him.
[2:23:14] read message after message
[2:23:17] realizing
[2:23:18] the message of our was beyond what I
[2:23:21] grew up seeing.
[2:23:26] Hallelujah. And immediately
[2:23:28] I started operating
[2:23:32] and I have seen real results.
[2:23:37] the mad people getting healed.
[2:23:41] Recently,
[2:23:43] recently I was ina
[2:23:46] they brought a certain sister to the
[2:23:48] crusade.
[2:23:50] She was mad,
[2:23:52] insane.
[2:23:55] And then as I was preaching
[2:23:58] on the crusade,
[2:24:00] at the end of my preaching,
[2:24:02] I started praying,
[2:24:05] I started praying. And the spirit
[2:24:07] ministered to me and told me just lay
[2:24:10] your hand upon the other sister behind.
[2:24:14] And I called her from where she was
[2:24:15] standing and she came near where I was
[2:24:19] and I laid my hand upon her started
[2:24:22] declaring.
[2:24:24] I told her your life is changing from
[2:24:27] today
[2:24:30] the Holy Ghost.
[2:24:32] Amen. And after declaring
[2:24:36] I told her your life is changing.
[2:24:40] Your destiny God is working upon it.
[2:24:44] She was married before. Then she got mad
[2:24:48] and because of madness, she could not
[2:24:50] manage marriage
[2:24:52] and she went and stay with her old mom.
[2:24:56] when she was brought in the crusade and
[2:24:59] I I declared those words after like
[2:25:03] three four days I received a call
[2:25:08] actually before I after the service
[2:25:11] people told me you know the lady that
[2:25:14] you've prayed for she's a mad
[2:25:18] and I said okay she's delivered
[2:25:25] after a few days. I received a call
[2:25:29] and they told me the lady was healed
[2:25:34] completely
[2:25:35] and she went back to her marriage.
[2:25:38] [Applause]
[2:25:41] I have the message here and I've
[2:25:44] received many messages and many calls
[2:25:49] concerning that testimony.
[2:25:53] Amen.
[2:25:55] But here you find church
[2:25:58] they believe in the miracles
[2:26:00] others they don't believe in that
[2:26:03] others they just believe in the bom of
[2:26:05] the Holy Ghost
[2:26:07] others in the in the thunders
[2:26:14] let me tell you I believe in all those
[2:26:18] things
[2:26:23] hallelujah I've got following me.
[2:26:27] Brother, he believes in them all. I do
[2:26:31] believe in them all. I believe in the
[2:26:33] baptism of the Holy Ghost. I believe in
[2:26:36] healing. I believe in miracle. I believe
[2:26:39] in prosperity.
[2:26:42] When we speak about prosperity,
[2:26:44] are you a Pentecostal?
[2:26:46] That is the tradition.
[2:26:52] Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise
[2:26:56] God. Hallelujah. Amen. There are people
[2:27:00] that have entered into it
[2:27:04] with sincerity
[2:27:06] and I've got reason
[2:27:09] out of it.
[2:27:13] I've seen people feeling the being
[2:27:15] filled the bapture
[2:27:26] [Music]
[2:27:38] that they will meet him in the air.
[2:27:42] Amen.
[2:27:43] Let me tell you in a message a person
[2:27:45] experiencing
[2:27:48] brother said he was talking about the
[2:27:51] due.
[2:27:53] [Music]
[2:27:55] He was talking about the due
[2:27:58] he said the due every morning the due
[2:28:01] comes on earth
[2:28:04] every morning. But when the sun starts
[2:28:07] to come forth
[2:28:10] across the earth,
[2:28:13] you you will not see it.
[2:28:17] You will not see it.

[2:28:51] it will tell you that yesterday I was
[2:28:56] somewhere and this morning I came here
[2:29:01] and I won't tell you as that sun is
[2:29:04] passing by I am getting the the the the
[2:29:08] hope
[2:29:10] of going back where I was was
[2:29:16] glory
[2:29:20] I'm now going back where I was
[2:29:24] that person experience with God
[2:29:27] saying it is the same thing with a
[2:29:29] Christian
[2:29:31] that has gone to the unknown
[2:29:36] those people that had ever reached far
[2:29:41] they are sure
[2:29:45] one day when the son of righteousness
[2:29:50] shall appear
[2:29:52] shall appear and go across the world
[2:29:56] those people's heart will start
[2:29:57] sparkling
[2:30:02] they are going
[2:30:04] where there was
[2:30:08] They have ever been taken
[2:30:11] in the spread
[2:30:19] vision
[2:30:21] people does not believe in vision others
[2:30:23] does not believe in dreams but I won't
[2:30:26] tell you
[2:30:28] speaks about the three elements of
[2:30:29] humanity
[2:30:33] three elements of humanity, human.
[2:30:42] He speaks about those three elements of
[2:30:44] humanity
[2:30:46] and he spoke the about the first.
[2:30:50] He said it is personality.
[2:30:55] Everyone has got a personality.
[2:30:58] Even some person has got it.
[2:31:01] Personality is the access
[2:31:05] That that tells you
[2:31:09] that don't just cross the road.
[2:31:12] Don't just cross the Lord.
[2:31:14] Yeah. Then you have personality.
[2:31:17] You can greet people.
[2:31:20] You're a good citizen
[2:31:22] there. You have you have the personality
[2:31:25] and that's the first element of
[2:31:26] humanity.
[2:31:28] Then he speaks about the second one. He
[2:31:31] said it is faith is strong revelation
[2:31:37] of course faith is revelation
[2:31:40] of course.
[2:31:46] Amen. So he speaks about first stroke
[2:31:49] revelation.
[2:31:51] Some people just end there
[2:31:59] to revelation stroke of faith
[2:32:02] and that is wonderful.
[2:32:04] And he said the last one it is vision.
[2:32:10] Vision will not work in heaven.
[2:32:14] Vision works here.
[2:32:17] Amen.
[2:32:19] Amen.
[2:32:22] Hallelujah. Vision works here.
[2:32:25] Where you can be in a vision
[2:32:28] and see the plans of the enemy
[2:32:31] where you can be in a vision and be
[2:32:34] taken in the heaven
[2:32:37] like a brother.
[2:32:39] You people
[2:32:42] was taken to heaven. But when brother
[2:32:46] came,
[2:32:47] he said, "Oh,
[2:32:49] I can't preach this.
[2:32:53] I made another decision.
[2:32:56] He made another decision.
[2:32:59] A decision upon a decision.
[2:33:05] Amen. Hallelujah. And he said, "Oh, I
[2:33:09] can't stop this." After he had reached
[2:33:12] to heaven
[2:33:14] and he came to us. Can we speak about
[2:33:17] Paul? He was taken in the third heaven.
[2:33:23] You mean to tell me those things stopped
[2:33:25] from there?
[2:33:27] No.
[2:33:28] Just our tradition
[2:33:31] has limited us.
[2:33:37] Hallelujah.
[2:33:39] Just our tradition
[2:33:42] limits us.
[2:33:48] If you believe in these things,
[2:33:50] if you can only turn loose yourself from
[2:33:53] those tradition,
[2:33:56] I want tell you brothers,
[2:33:59] your face will be also turned loose.
[2:34:06] Amen. We've caged ourselves.
[2:34:10] We've caged ourselves.
[2:34:16] Cage from the word cage. What is cage?
[2:34:19] Brother Lord,
[2:34:24] it's like
[2:34:35] we've ced ourselves
[2:34:38] and we can't go in the eyes alone.
[2:34:45] We can't have results
[2:34:48] that really the world can look at
[2:34:52] and say, "Oh, wow. This is wonderful." I
[2:34:55] want to tell you, brother, we need a
[2:34:58] personal experience.
[2:35:01] We need to turn lose our soul
[2:35:05] and our lives will not remain the same.
[2:35:10] If we only be turned loose
[2:35:14] from the traditions that we have got
[2:35:18] then I want to tell you our faith will
[2:35:21] also be turned loose
[2:35:24] and it will be it will stimulate
[2:35:29] and I'm here to stimulate your faith.
[2:35:33] I'm here to stir up your faith.
[2:35:36] I want to tell you
[2:35:38] the same God
[2:35:40] At the day of Pentecost is the same God
[2:35:43] we serve.
[2:35:46] We do not serve infido.
[2:35:49] We serve a living God.
[2:35:51] Hallelujah.
[2:35:53] But we are caged by tradition
[2:35:57] and we cannot have the real results
[2:36:00] like they had at the Pentecost.
[2:36:09] His face was turned loose.
[2:36:12] He was not the same. He went forth and
[2:36:16] met the lamb
[2:36:19] at the beautiful gate and said feather
[2:36:22] and silver.
[2:36:26] Amen. Amen. God
[2:36:30] and what I have what I give you. All his
[2:36:34] fear had gone.
[2:36:37] He was free.
[2:36:39] We need to be free.
[2:36:42] We need to be free. We have got his
[2:36:44] people. We have got his elected
[2:36:48] them. The son has made free
[2:37:01] son made free
[2:37:05] need.
[2:37:09] We don't need to be like spies.
[2:37:13] Oh, I would have done this.
[2:37:15] But what would they say?
[2:37:18] Even sometimes it is an inspiration.
[2:37:23] But then you fear I want tell you I'm
[2:37:27] not a fearful man.
[2:37:29] me I just do things as I'm
[2:37:37] of course sometimes the judges farewell
[2:37:42] farewell
[2:37:45] but after times I realize he was he was
[2:37:48] on a right track
[2:37:53] hallelujah
[2:37:54] hallelujah
[2:37:56] hallelujah I want to tell you. We need
[2:37:59] to be free. We are free people. We are
[2:38:03] sons and daughters of God. I always say
[2:38:07] I always say even the church order
[2:38:12] works when the Holy Ghost is not yet
[2:38:14] come
[2:38:20] at the Pentecost
[2:38:22] when the Holy Ghost came
[2:38:25] could make the church in order.
[2:38:29] [Applause]
[2:38:33] would
[2:38:37] just speak tong
[2:38:43] the church was broken.
[2:38:46] The church order was disorganized.
[2:38:49] Why the great order
[2:38:53] had come in
[2:38:56] at the day of Pentecost
[2:38:58] the church did not ask
[2:39:01] I want to tell you you deconies
[2:39:04] some of the donies the Holy Ghost is
[2:39:07] anointed of you
[2:39:10] you make you you you you pretend to be
[2:39:13] so busy
[2:39:17] until you try to deny announce the Holy
[2:39:20] Ghost.
[2:39:28] Some of the deaconist
[2:39:31] let me tell you
[2:39:34] be aware
[2:39:36] before doing the thing.
[2:39:39] Is it the Holy Ghost
[2:39:42] or evil spirit?
[2:39:47] Amen. I've seen many times as the Holy
[2:39:51] Ghost comes down
[2:39:53] just take people out.
[2:39:59] This is real.
[2:40:01] Some of you you are blessed. You've just
[2:40:03] come under the ministry of pastor Ber
[2:40:09] in the word.
[2:40:15] But for us who grow
[2:40:20] Hallelujah.
[2:40:23] To tell you the truth, I've seen this.
[2:40:26] I'm talking experiencing
[2:40:32] the Holy Ghost comes and
[2:40:35] do something different and then the
[2:40:38] brother, they got the the sister or
[2:40:41] brother and they take him out.
[2:40:48] I'm
[2:40:51] actually before that I want tell you I
[2:40:54] was one day in a certain service we had
[2:40:57] gone for the mission and as the brother
[2:41:00] was ministering the Holy Ghost came I
[2:41:03] slew two sisters in the service
[2:41:07] and then and then the new
[2:41:10] started
[2:41:11] I told
[2:41:15] And after that, I think after like two
[2:41:18] days was sitting somewhere,
[2:41:21] I was I think was eating lunch
[2:41:25] and then a certain minister said, "You
[2:41:28] see today the other demons that attacked
[2:41:32] the other sister,
[2:41:37] I prayed for her
[2:41:40] and I felt inside me
[2:41:42] Oh, if I can talk to this one.
[2:41:46] But I had to keep quiet. And then a
[2:41:49] sister
[2:41:52] who there there was another sister
[2:41:56] who was one of the team we had gone with
[2:42:00] just the brother.
[2:42:02] Are you sure I was evil spirit?
[2:42:07] Oh, holy ghost.
[2:42:10] Then I got church.
[2:42:12] I said now
[2:42:18] let me start on him.
[2:42:20] And I started giving him quotes.
[2:42:24] Brother saying,
[2:42:26] brother, I gave him a quotation and I
[2:42:29] want to give it it here. Brother said in
[2:42:32] the message spirit of truth.
[2:42:36] Amen. Amen. Amen. that God does
[2:42:38] something just from which we are used
[2:42:41] of.
[2:42:44] Sometimes God does something that is
[2:42:46] different from what we are used of
[2:42:50] and we denounce it at all.
[2:43:02] I'm brother B say
[2:43:05] where in in in where we are supposed
[2:43:09] to search the scriptures
[2:43:13] whether it is true or not
[2:43:17] we just denounce it
[2:43:20] those are Pentecostals
[2:43:23] you denounce it
[2:43:26] and brother said he said I think
[2:43:32] said one time
[2:43:34] that if it is of God,
[2:43:37] we let us not be found fighting against
[2:43:40] it.
[2:43:44] And he said, if it's not of the Lord, it
[2:43:48] will not out anyhow.
[2:43:52] out out anyhow
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:56] because it is written whatever my father
[2:43:59] did not plant
[2:44:01] it shall be proed away
[2:44:04] better give it time
[2:44:08] it
[2:44:14] I'm done with you
[2:44:18] Hallelujah
[2:44:19] your pastor whistled to me here
[2:44:23] and he told me feel the liberty
[2:44:27] preach as you feel
[2:44:29] as you pre you you preach always.
[2:44:33] So there I got energy.
[2:44:36] I said okay.
[2:44:39] Some they get results out of it
[2:44:42] and others other
[2:44:45] only mocking
[2:44:48] in the message all things paragraph 91.
[2:44:55] Others are just mocking.
[2:44:58] And there was too
[2:45:05] And there is too much mocking going on
[2:45:08] today.
[2:45:14] Too much mocking.
[2:45:17] Too much impersonation.
[2:45:21] impersonations
[2:45:24] comp.
[2:45:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. That is
[2:45:35] it.
[2:45:39] And when Isaiah came on that scene,
[2:45:43] he put he spelled it out.
[2:45:47] And so said God said that he's hiding
[2:45:52] his face from your prayers
[2:45:56] because you've got your ritualistic form
[2:46:04] yet it is the truth.
[2:46:08] You are doing what he told you
[2:46:12] but you are not doing it in sincerity.
[2:46:17] And I want to say like this.
[2:46:20] We are in a straight the true message
[2:46:24] but sometimes we are taking the message
[2:46:27] to be something very small.
[2:46:33] Brother and sisters,
[2:46:35] this message it is a precious thing.
[2:46:40] It is a precious thing.
[2:46:43] It is a precious thing. And it did not
[2:46:46] just come in words.
[2:46:49] It came with that demonstration of the
[2:46:51] Holy Ghost.
[2:46:54] The message came with the manifestation
[2:46:56] of the Holy Ghost.
[2:46:59] This message come with the vindication.
[2:47:03] God always vicating it.
[2:47:06] And where are those signs now?
[2:47:09] Brother, sister, where are those saints
[2:47:10] now?
[2:47:12] Where are the lamb walking?
[2:47:15] Where are the dumb speaking?
[2:47:25] We are just
[2:47:29] we are in the message. Rapture rapture.
[2:47:31] Wow. Wow. Message message
[2:47:35] brothers quoted something. We are in a
[2:47:38] message. We are going for the rapture.
[2:47:40] At the end of it,
[2:47:43] the church becomes powerless.
[2:47:50] That spirit
[2:47:52] in the church age book.
[2:47:56] He said that the antichrist spirit
[2:48:00] will creep into the church
[2:48:04] and make it look
[2:48:07] for more
[2:48:09] palace
[2:48:15] for
[2:48:19] one day.
[2:48:22] Let me testify this also. One day
[2:48:26] I met her sister.
[2:48:29] She was to the pastor to a certain
[2:48:31] pastor.
[2:48:34] She suffered of her illness for long.
[2:48:40] I remember also using my small amount
[2:48:44] financial support to support him.
[2:48:48] Of
[2:48:50] course, the sister was in a district far
[2:48:53] from the district I was in
[2:48:58] later alone. the situation worsened
[2:49:03] and the pastor,
[2:49:05] they had to get the sister from the deep
[2:49:08] district
[2:49:12] and bring her to a general hospital in
[2:49:19] as believers, as brothers and sisters,
[2:49:23] as brothers and sisters,
[2:49:26] we went also to see them.
[2:49:30] I went with my a certain brother.
[2:49:33] We reached there.
[2:49:35] Of course, brother love should had to
[2:49:38] continue.
[2:49:41] We went to see the brother and sister.
[2:49:44] Reaching there, the pastor was not there
[2:49:47] and then we start of course we had some
[2:49:50] little conversation.
[2:49:53] brothers to me,
[2:49:55] can you pray?
[2:49:58] Being that she's a pastor's wife,
[2:50:02] do we need to pray? I said, really, do
[2:50:05] we need
[2:50:07] also? The same question came to but let
[2:50:10] alone I told the brother let us pray
[2:50:13] just as believers
[2:50:15] we are Christians we should pray as long
[2:50:18] as we've we've meet
[2:50:21] and then we shout some little words
[2:50:23] there
[2:50:24] and we prayed and we went away after
[2:50:28] like 15 minutes
[2:50:31] we received a call that the sisters pull
[2:50:35] out the witchcraft
[2:50:41] They had thought it was a normal disease
[2:50:46] but it was a witchcraft
[2:50:51] and now
[2:50:53] my my heart received a question
[2:50:57] pastor's wife is in this condition
[2:51:07] But for them they are there rapture
[2:51:09] rapture. Oh we've got a message
[2:51:13] and some say we don't need even miracles
[2:51:16] even when you are bewitched
[2:51:22] even when you are still bewitched.
[2:51:28] How can you bewitch me?
[2:51:31] There's something wrong.
[2:51:36] A pastor's wife bewitched.
[2:51:41] And the Bible says
[2:51:43] there is no witchcraft
[2:51:47] to Israel.
[2:51:49] And if Israel receives witchcraft
[2:51:54] because it explains itself,
[2:52:00] there's something wrong.
[2:52:05] And we are just in tradition.
[2:52:09] Now I think you've started getting
[2:52:10] something.
[2:52:13] Hallelujah.
[2:52:14] I saw you being got disappointed after
[2:52:17] reading the scripture.
[2:52:20] And always I want to disappoint people
[2:52:26] that's me
[2:52:29] times they receive me to pace
[2:52:33] and people they get disappointed
[2:52:36] totally
[2:52:38] by late alone
[2:52:41] God their their hope becomes a fresh
[2:52:49] H pastor did not tell me what time I've
[2:52:52] got to stop.
[2:52:55] [Music]
[2:52:56] enough.
[2:52:58] Uh I'm having time out up to when
[2:53:02] pastor am I still having some like 20
[2:53:04] minutes.
[2:53:07] He said but okay let me went up listen
[2:53:13] God said
[2:53:15] so you be correctly in the word
[2:53:20] but if you don't do it with love
[2:53:24] and sincerity
[2:53:26] God said he would hide his face from
[2:53:28] you.
[2:53:31] And he would not hear your prayers.
[2:53:34] [Music]
[2:53:36] That's the way.
[2:53:39] Praise God.
[2:53:41] Hallelujah.
[2:53:42] Praise God. And now listen.
[2:53:46] God has a palace region.
[2:53:56] Amen. God hates a parasy.
[2:53:59] [Music]
[2:54:02] Any region today that has got Christ in
[2:54:06] has not got Christ in it
[2:54:10] is powerless.
[2:54:13] But every region that Christ is in
[2:54:17] and is under his blood
[2:54:21] and he's got power in it.
[2:54:24] Oh, you may say
[2:54:26] God hates a par hat without power.
[2:54:33] Yes,
[2:54:37] is a stink to me.
[2:54:43] That is God. He it's a paracy region
[2:54:49] to have power in it.
[2:54:52] I can even try to uritize it
[2:54:57] to a church. God hates a palace church
[2:55:06] that church without power.
[2:55:09] [Music]
[2:55:12] And then we are there.
[2:55:15] We don't need those things.
[2:55:17] We don't need miracles,
[2:55:21] yeah,
[2:55:23] we are far away,
[2:55:25] [Music]
[2:55:27] but God hates that powerless church.
[2:55:31] The church has got to have power in it.
[2:55:36] To be hated by God.
[2:55:39] Amen. Amen. and God will pour it out.
[2:55:45] And brother said
[2:55:47] the church that Christ claims to be his
[2:55:53] church with Mark 16 in action.
[2:55:59] Mark 16, what does it say?
[2:56:02] These sense shall fall them that
[2:56:04] believe.
[2:56:05] I want to tell you brother and sister
[2:56:08] this message is not a parish message
[2:56:12] this message is a powerful message
[2:56:15] it is from God
[2:56:17] and whatever comes from God is powerful
[2:56:22] God's word is powerful let us not limit
[2:56:25] his power let us not limit God by our
[2:56:29] tradition
[2:56:31] let us not limit God by our thinking
[2:56:35] Let us not limit God by things that
[2:56:38] we've got as rituals
[2:56:43] and masses.
[2:56:46] God is a powerful God. He's not limited
[2:56:50] and God does not change. He's the same
[2:56:54] yesterday, today, and forever.
[2:56:59] And our God is a God of spirituals.
[2:57:05] Let me speak about this. Our God does
[2:57:08] financial
[2:57:10] and what we call span.
[2:57:13] It is to do a thing which is above
[2:57:17] natural.
[2:57:21] What no man can think about
[2:57:25] that is what we call spiral.
[2:57:29] Where where the walls of Jero
[2:57:32] they required to crumble.
[2:57:35] They had to crumble by just a mere
[2:57:38] singing.
[2:57:39] How did the devil crumble?
[2:57:48] Hallelujah. Amen. How did they crumbled?
[2:57:52] Just singing me just going around
[2:57:56] singing and the walls had to crumble.
[2:58:00] How weak we are day.
[2:58:06] That is
[2:58:09] where God said or the scripture said
[2:58:12] that the rock give them water,
[2:58:16] a moving rock.
[2:58:22] And the Bible said the rock went with
[2:58:26] them through the wilderness, a moving
[2:58:29] rock.
[2:58:33] It gave them water. Water from the rock.
[2:58:40] Just as meat of the rock,
[2:58:44] it produced water.
[2:58:47] surprised the water to them
[2:58:50] and they drank.
[2:58:52] That's what we call spacual.
[2:58:55] Just a smid of the Red Sea
[2:58:58] and the Red Sea had to depart
[2:59:05] by a Smith
[2:59:07] where men like
[2:59:10] just came and stand before Golius
[2:59:14] with just stone.
[2:59:16] which
[2:59:18] I said glorious
[2:59:20] will be no more from today
[2:59:24] will be no more and he stood I always
[2:59:28] say he a great battle
[2:59:32] because of his faith
[2:59:35] and make it to be a child battle
[2:59:40] just children they wanted to face with
[2:59:43] stones
[2:59:48] But
[2:59:49] did not believe in the stones. His faith
[2:59:53] was in his God.
[2:59:55] His confession was
[2:59:58] that God does not deliver by many. God
[3:00:01] does not deliver by spears. God does not
[3:00:04] deliver by charity.
[3:00:06] He delivers by his name.
[3:00:11] Amen.
[3:00:14] I can see David
[3:00:16] coming up with the stone and he got a
[3:00:20] stone because he I I know
[3:00:24] he had no target.
[3:00:26] He was not perfect in target but he had
[3:00:30] faith. He got a stone and believed his
[3:00:35] brothers were there just mocking.
[3:00:38] His brothers were just smoking saying
[3:00:41] that brother is so prayed
[3:00:48] but his faith was in God and went forth.
[3:00:54] His target was not yet perfect and he
[3:00:57] just got a stone and put it in his
[3:01:00] string shoot and he casted it. I always
[3:01:04] say his target was not right.
[3:01:09] But God himself
[3:01:13] because of the f of
[3:01:16] came down and took the stone. He
[3:01:20] punctuate it. He blessed it
[3:01:24] and he added strength
[3:01:27] in it
[3:01:29] and he put down the shield.
[3:01:33] You mean you may tell me Godas was just
[3:01:36] stupid
[3:01:38] that he could not protect himself with
[3:01:40] the shield.
[3:01:44] But there was power
[3:01:46] that that got the shield.
[3:01:50] I pull it down
[3:01:52] and then it targeted him.
[3:01:55] That wasn't David.
[3:02:01] But the face of David and brother
[3:02:05] face no defeat.
[3:02:07] Faith knows no defeat
[3:02:10] no defeat.
[3:02:12] I've been rebuilding your faith.
[3:02:15] I've been just motivating you. I've been
[3:02:18] stiring up your faith. Now as you are as
[3:02:22] you turn loose yourself, your faith is
[3:02:25] turning loose. Your faith is turning
[3:02:28] loose. If you are lame, you are able to
[3:02:33] go back home healed.
[3:02:35] This day,
[3:02:37] this day is your day. If you're
[3:02:41] grandpas,
[3:02:42] this is your day. If you're dumb one,
[3:02:46] this is your day. I don't preach a
[3:02:48] powerless message. I preach a powerful
[3:02:51] message. This message come with power.
[3:02:55] This message come with the manifestation
[3:02:57] of the Holy Ghost. The same pill of
[3:02:59] fire. This message was followed by the
[3:03:02] pill of fire. This message had the pill
[3:03:05] of fire and the pill of fire is here.
[3:03:09] Fire is here. The angel of God is here
[3:03:13] to minister to you with your healing to
[3:03:16] minister to you with your deliverance.
[3:03:20] If you cannot read, can lose yourself
[3:03:25] from all the tradition from all the
[3:03:27] things that have been binding in your
[3:03:31] mind. Brother, sister, check your mind.
[3:03:36] Check your mind. The Holy Ghost is here
[3:03:40] to fill you. The Holy Ghost is here to
[3:03:44] deliver you. The Holy Ghost is here to
[3:03:48] touch on you. I feel the anointing. I
[3:03:52] feel the anointing. I feel it here. I
[3:03:55] feel the anointing. And the Bible say
[3:03:58] that anointing shall break the
[3:04:06] praise God. Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, glory.
[3:04:09] Glory. Glory.
[3:04:13] I feel I feel like traveling home.
[3:04:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[3:04:20] I feel like traveling all
[3:04:27] glory glory
[3:04:31] region
[3:04:33] to have power in it.
[3:04:36] It's got to have
[3:04:39] and sincity
[3:04:42] brings power.
[3:04:43] [Music]
[3:04:46] Sincerity
[3:04:48] brings power.
[3:04:54] Sincerity
[3:04:56] brings power.
[3:04:58] Not for worship.
[3:05:02] Power worship
[3:05:04] to know that you've passed from death
[3:05:07] onto life.
[3:05:11] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. God want
[3:05:13] to perform his word
[3:05:16] by his power. And when the church denies
[3:05:19] his power,
[3:05:21] how can he perform and medicate his
[3:05:24] power? When the church explains it out
[3:05:31] and says,
[3:05:33] when the church explains it out,
[3:05:37] says for it was for other day,
[3:05:43] something. Oh,
[3:05:47] God
[3:05:49] wants to perform his work
[3:05:52] by his power.
[3:05:56] And my last quotation is
[3:05:58] oh you say sometimes people they say I
[3:06:03] went down there and there was a lot of
[3:06:05] power
[3:06:07] rather the floor was dancing in the
[3:06:09] spirit
[3:06:12] and not and there was no enough faith to
[3:06:16] heal the two sick.
[3:06:19] [Music]
[3:06:23] You're saying power
[3:06:25] but there was not even power to heal the
[3:06:27] two sick
[3:06:43] you call that power
[3:06:46] that's not power that's blessings
[3:06:57] people shouting enjoying the goodness of
[3:06:59] God. Those are blessings, not power.
[3:07:07] There is a lot of difference
[3:07:11] between blessings and power.
[3:07:15] [Music]
[3:07:16] And God makes his blessings upon the
[3:07:19] righteous and unrighteousness.
[3:07:23] But when we talk about power,
[3:07:27] we mean power.
[3:07:30] Hallelujah.
[3:07:31] Let us take what God means.
[3:07:36] We got to get back to the truth.
[3:07:41] Friends, we got to come back to what God
[3:07:43] means.
[3:07:45] If he says power,
[3:07:48] he mean his power.
[3:07:53] It says I I've given you power
[3:07:57] over the evil spirits.
[3:08:02] The Bible English version says power.
[3:08:06] So we can call it power.
[3:08:08] If if the Bible said given you power
[3:08:12] over the evil spirit,
[3:08:14] God mean power.
[3:08:17] Amen.
[3:08:19] God gave you power
[3:08:22] but the power is laying dormant
[3:08:26] by the traditionist.
[3:08:32] The power is just laying dormant.
[3:08:35] God mean what he says.
[3:08:38] He says what he means.
[3:08:41] He said power. This mean is power. He
[3:08:45] gave us power over evil spirit.
[3:08:50] And dumbness is a spirit.
[3:08:53] Dumbness.
[3:08:54] The Bible reminds me or speaks about a
[3:08:58] certain man
[3:09:00] who came the Lord Jesus. He first took
[3:09:02] his ch child
[3:09:04] to the apostles and apostles casted the
[3:09:07] devil and the devil did not go
[3:09:11] and let alone. He brought the child to
[3:09:14] Jesus and said to Jesus, my child as a a
[3:09:20] dumb spirit.
[3:09:22] The man realized
[3:09:24] is a spirit.
[3:09:27] Dumbness is a spirit. Deafness is a
[3:09:30] spirit.
[3:09:31] Hallelujah. Finance is a spirit
[3:09:35] and God gave us power over every spirit,
[3:09:40] over every evil spirit. I have that
[3:09:43] power. I have that power. It has been
[3:09:47] working in my ministry. And I want to
[3:09:49] tell you if you have any problem
[3:09:52] right now, I don't care if you are
[3:09:56] barren.
[3:09:58] If you are barren, the God that I serve
[3:10:01] is able to make that full room
[3:10:07] to
[3:10:11] one day was in a church in
[3:10:15] that is ginger. Last year, it was
[3:10:18] September,
[3:10:20] I went together with my wife and my
[3:10:22] family
[3:10:23] and I preached and I preached. They got
[3:10:27] a certain sister. There was a certain I
[3:10:30] can call her sister
[3:10:33] but she was a Muslim.
[3:10:36] Amen. She had come to the service
[3:10:40] people had invited her.
[3:10:44] The pastor told me that he told him, he
[3:10:48] told her
[3:10:50] the other minister God uses him.
[3:10:53] That is pastoral
[3:10:55] of
[3:10:57] pastoral.
[3:10:58] And when I preached, many people got
[3:11:01] healed.
[3:11:03] But I want to tell you this.
[3:11:06] The sister
[3:11:08] came on the prayer line
[3:11:11] and she told me, "I've spent five years
[3:11:13] in marriage,
[3:11:15] but I've never conceived."
[3:11:18] And I told her, "Do you believe?
[3:11:21] Do you believe that God is able to?" She
[3:11:25] said, "Yeah, he believed." And she
[3:11:27] believed. And we prayed. It was 1
[3:11:31] September
[3:11:32] September
[3:11:35] last year and on 22nd December
[3:11:42] December
[3:11:46] she went to the past of that area
[3:11:49] and she told her I'm now in my fourth
[3:11:52] month.
[3:11:55] I can say she conceived immediately
[3:11:59] after the prayer.
[3:12:01] Uganda
[3:12:08] all that very week.
[3:12:16] Oh glory glory.
[3:12:19] That is the God we serve.
[3:12:22] Many many sisters
[3:12:26] I I remember of two sisters
[3:12:30] they already believers a demon tormented
[3:12:35] and one sister when I called for the
[3:12:37] prayer line she was behind and she ran
[3:12:41] out demon took out and people went
[3:12:46] chasing her and they brought her back to
[3:12:48] the valley and I casted demon. That was
[3:12:52] the end of that situation.
[3:12:56] Another sister, she was approaching
[3:12:58] where I was.
[3:13:00] She she started getting trembling
[3:13:04] and asked her what's wrong. She said,
[3:13:06] "I'm scared. I'm fearing." I saved those
[3:13:09] demons. Immediately the demons her
[3:13:15] and God delivered her.
[3:13:19] What are you talking about?
[3:13:21] Let us turn lose our lives
[3:13:25] from the tradition
[3:13:28] of this. I believe
[3:13:30] that one I don't believe that one. That
[3:13:33] one is it in the scripture. If it is in
[3:13:36] the scripture, you ought to believe it.
[3:13:41] That's what makes you to be a believer.
[3:13:47] If you believe a part of it and don't
[3:13:50] believe a part then you are not a
[3:13:52] believer.
[3:13:56] What are you? Answer yourself.
[3:14:00] We should believe all things
[3:14:02] and that same God is here. I want to
[3:14:05] tell you I was in church. I was
[3:14:09] preaching this very message and there
[3:14:11] was a sister who had the an who had the
[3:14:16] almness.
[3:14:18] She was having a pain in her leg.
[3:14:22] She said she has an invisible amness.
[3:14:26] 31 that day
[3:14:28] as I was praying as I was preaching
[3:14:31] after preaching
[3:14:33] I prayed when they were behind
[3:14:36] immediately the power of God touched
[3:14:38] upon her and she was healed she said she
[3:14:42] could not walk for male
[3:14:46] power of God delivered her
[3:14:49] spent 76 years with this
[3:14:54] and God delivered
[3:14:56] in that service.
[3:14:58] And when I called for the for people to
[3:15:00] come to be laid hand upon
[3:15:04] then she came and she just asked me to
[3:15:08] pray for her that she become sincere
[3:15:10] with God.
[3:15:13] She spent two weeks without testifying.
[3:15:18] She spent two weeks
[3:15:21] and one day she came. said, "I thought
[3:15:24] things were just dramas,
[3:15:27] but I don't understand this.
[3:15:31] I'm healed.
[3:15:36] I've seen the dam speaking.
[3:15:40] I during the season of co I was taken I
[3:15:44] I was taken to a certain family where
[3:15:47] there was a sister
[3:15:49] who had who was blind
[3:15:52] with one eye
[3:15:54] the other eye bringing tears
[3:15:58] the other eye started like that also.
[3:16:02] because she was expecting to become
[3:16:04] blind, total blind.
[3:16:07] But when I was praying,
[3:16:09] the power of God touched upon her. When
[3:16:12] she looked out, when she opened her
[3:16:14] eyes, she was seeing and she shouted.
[3:16:18] Oh, I see. I see. I remember her mama
[3:16:22] getting into the little into the small
[3:16:24] room
[3:16:26] and she got 20k
[3:16:29] and she brought and I told her We are
[3:16:32] freely given and we give freely
[3:16:36] buy for this for buy for that sister
[3:16:39] something to use.
[3:16:44] That is good. Can I talk about things
[3:16:47] that happened in where I'm going
[3:16:49] tomorrow even
[3:16:53] there was a a brother an old brother. He
[3:16:58] had also witchcraft
[3:17:00] and he had three wounds
[3:17:04] bringing pass.
[3:17:06] He said every night.
[3:17:09] How
[3:17:11] bad could get wet by those pass
[3:17:18] and he came in the service with that
[3:17:19] pain
[3:17:22] and I preached. After preaching, I
[3:17:24] prayed for him and he came and I prayed
[3:17:27] for him. I prayed for him. I told him, I
[3:17:31] believe all things are possible. I was
[3:17:33] on the crusade that night.
[3:17:36] Then he went back home.
[3:17:39] Back home. The pain had gone and the
[3:17:42] past had gone.
[3:17:45] The wounds got dry.
[3:17:49] Hallelujah.
[3:17:52] The wounds got dry.
[3:17:55] His bed could no more wet by wet.
[3:17:59] Amen.
[3:18:01] One time I was taken to a certain
[3:18:04] hospital in
[3:18:07] it is called
[3:18:09] hospital.
[3:18:10] [Music]
[3:18:12] There was a boy
[3:18:14] was in like five years. He had a wound
[3:18:18] here
[3:18:19] and the boy the pass full of that the
[3:18:23] pass was in that wound
[3:18:26] and the doctors could just get the
[3:18:29] cotton
[3:18:31] and put it inside
[3:18:33] and fix some pass.
[3:18:38] They had no hope of the boy getting well
[3:18:43] and a certain brother took me there. And
[3:18:46] I met the the family members
[3:18:49] of the family members to me was the man
[3:18:52] who was working with the other brother
[3:18:54] asked me pastor
[3:18:57] would the boy get healed. I said yeah.
[3:19:00] He laughed. But the Bible say brethren
[3:19:04] don't be deceived. God is not mocked.
[3:19:09] I prayed for the boy. I pray I went to
[3:19:12] the mom. I built the faith of the mom. I
[3:19:16] remember I remember talking to the mom.
[3:19:19] Mom was busy eating bag
[3:19:24] this sack of 500
[3:19:28] could not give me
[3:19:31] and I felt in my heart if this lady
[3:19:34] could just Allah cannot me.
[3:19:38] and pay her undivided attention to me.
[3:19:42] The joy she would have got,
[3:19:45] it would have been beyond
[3:19:52] as I was sharing the word with her.
[3:19:55] She put the bag down and she looked at
[3:19:58] me and she paid undeided attention to me
[3:20:02] and started building her faith. I later
[3:20:05] to the brother, do you have anything to
[3:20:07] tell her? Brother said, "No, I perceived
[3:20:11] faith."
[3:20:14] Brother said, "She has got faith." And
[3:20:17] of course, also I was seeing faith in
[3:20:20] her,
[3:20:21] [Music]
[3:20:22] of course, when you in the spirit, you
[3:20:25] can detect these things.
[3:20:30] Hallelujah. I saw her
[3:20:34] got his face
[3:20:36] and we prayed without laying the hand
[3:20:38] upon that child
[3:20:42] days
[3:20:44] just the fresh started gathering
[3:20:47] coming together.
[3:20:49] After just a few days the boy was
[3:20:52] healed. The other man who laughed
[3:20:56] met me and told me
[3:21:00] if the day I would decide to to come to
[3:21:03] to the born again churches
[3:21:07] the day I will decide
[3:21:10] I'll just automatically come come to
[3:21:12] your church.
[3:21:15] I said the boy was healed.
[3:21:18] I said but for me I'm not ready to to
[3:21:22] become born again.
[3:21:24] He said
[3:21:28] but he said
[3:21:30] take all my children
[3:21:33] to your church and he gave them he gave
[3:21:36] them to us some we are youth like my
[3:21:39] brother
[3:21:40] [Music]
[3:21:42] for me I'm now of age.
[3:21:47] Hallelujah. Amen. So that is God
[3:21:50] and I want as I went up I will not say
[3:21:53] anything
[3:21:55] power is here.
[3:21:57] That same God is here.
[3:22:00] Don't lose yourself.
[3:22:02] Don't lose yourself.
[3:22:05] Don't lose yourself from all your
[3:22:07] denomination
[3:22:12] from all the things that you are told.
[3:22:16] told you even I grew up
[3:22:19] thinking that things that I used to see
[3:22:23] was the true meaning of the message of
[3:22:25] the hour.
[3:22:28] But the message of
[3:22:31] is so beyond
[3:22:34] is so far away.
[3:22:37] It is a far what you think about.
[3:22:40] It is far what you can imagine.
[3:22:44] It is beyond that what you know.
[3:22:48] Nothing can't happen.
[3:22:51] If you can only believe
[3:22:54] this message is far
[3:22:57] because this message it is not word
[3:23:00] only. It is God himself
[3:23:04] in the letter form.
[3:23:06] It is the Lord himself,
[3:23:08] the great healer, the great deliverer,
[3:23:12] the mighty one, all shall die, the
[3:23:16] Elohim, the everlasting,

[3:35:38] in the rim who's above. You are the lord
[3:35:40] of lords. You are the king of kings. You
[3:35:44] are the mighty one. You are the
[3:35:46] everlasting one. Your power is above
[3:35:49] every power. Your spirit is above every
[3:35:52] spirit. Your name is above every name.
[3:35:55] You are the king of glory. I praise you
[3:35:58] Lord. You are Yahweh. You are Jehovah
[3:36:01] Jerry. How I love you Lord. How I bless
[3:36:05] your name. See you are the mighty one.
[3:36:08] You are here Lord. Touching upon
[3:36:10] everyone. Touching upon the sick
[3:36:13] touching upon the bound one. Touching
[3:36:16] upon the captive. You not leave us the
[3:36:18] same. We are not going back at the same
[3:36:21] home. Oh, thank you Lord. Father in the
[3:36:24] name of Jesus,
[3:36:26] your word has been preached
[3:36:29] in itness
[3:36:30] [Music]
[3:36:32] and it is written
[3:36:34] that thy word
[3:36:37] will not turn onto you
[3:36:39] in vine.
[3:36:41] Just like how the rain comes
[3:36:45] and and wet the earth,
[3:36:48] so it shall be
[3:36:51] onto thy word also.
[3:36:53] It shall not come back at you
[3:36:57] in vain or in void or doing what it is
[3:37:01] supposed to. Your word is powerful.
[3:37:05] It is here and it is changing someone.
[3:37:09] It is giving someone encounter
[3:37:12] with you. Someone who is getting a
[3:37:16] personal experience with you and every
[3:37:21] sick person Lord is not going back home.
[3:37:25] The same
[3:37:27] but is going to be healed right now. I
[3:37:31] serve a living God. I have seen you
[3:37:34] healing the sick. I have seen you
[3:37:36] delivering the captive. I have seen you
[3:37:39] doing great things. If I start to
[3:37:42] testify,
[3:37:43] I can't testify
[3:37:46] and finish all the testimonies. Lord, I
[3:37:48] thank you. You are touching upon your
[3:37:51] people. Fill thy people with the
[3:37:54] baptiling
[3:37:56] [Applause]
[3:37:59] for the bapt of the Holy Ghost. Oh, I
[3:38:02] pray for them that they may be filled
[3:38:06] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
