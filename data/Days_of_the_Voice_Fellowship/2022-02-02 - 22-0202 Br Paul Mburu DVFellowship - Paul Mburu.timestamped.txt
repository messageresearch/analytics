[13:56] book of deuteronomy
[14:00] uh chapter one
[14:28] just dragons again i want to appreciate
[14:30] you my community
[14:33] for this father to brought us
[14:34] [Applause]
[14:36] to caesar singing about your love of
[14:38] father
[14:41] that we so desire can fill our hearts
[14:45] imagine and to make us to be able
[14:47] soldiers in the army of the lord
[14:52] just surrender ourselves
[14:54] to you now
[14:56] as we just welcome your holy spirit to
[14:57] continue further ministering to us
[15:02] even through your word now
[15:05] and that as we listen as your children
[15:07] father
[15:10] receive
[15:27] those who have even had their own
[15:28] journeys
[15:30] bless them and baby with them
[15:32] again
[15:34] together we surrender to your will
[15:38] jesus name
[15:43] and the lord had the voice of your words
[15:45] and was wrath and swear saying
[15:55] surely there shall not one of these men
[15:58] of this evil generation see the good
[15:59] land which i swear to give unto your
[16:02] fathers
[16:16] he shall see it and to him will i give
[16:19] the land that he has trodden upon and to
[16:22] his children because he has wholly
[16:24] followed the lord
[17:04] lord made it possible that we can be
[17:05] here for this period of time
[17:09] to say that you know it has been in my
[17:10] heart for quite some time
[17:14] been communicating with brothers here
[17:16] and
[17:30] if
[17:45] amen you know when when people are
[17:46] somewhere where something is being
[17:47] established
[17:51] they also want to associate themselves
[17:53] in that place
[17:57] so that if there are 30 years to come
[18:11] people always want some name some good
[18:13] names
[18:16] so i'll write somewhere here
[18:18] i'm going to write
[18:20] paul was here
[18:23] that people write somewhere so that they
[18:25] can be associated with that place
[18:39] establishing his kingdom in different
[18:49] and me personally i'm french i'm friends
[18:51] with churches that go for outreach
[19:08] real child that expresses life can you
[19:10] say yeah daddy you're so good i'm a man
[19:13] i mean i i wouldn't want to talk
[19:15] anything doctrinal on that son
[19:20] but i think if i was in a church that
[19:21] does not believe in outreach
[19:27] i would consider myself dead
[19:30] so i don't want to say that is how it is
[19:32] elsewhere no but i'm just saying
[19:50] he reminded us that life is living for
[19:52] others
[19:54] [Music]
[19:56] do you believe that
[19:58] so when you can reach out to someone
[19:59] else
[20:02] that means you are living what the
[20:03] prophet said
[20:54] [Music]
[21:01] of holy following the lord
[21:12] because kaleb was given the promise
[21:20] [Music]
[21:41] all baptized unto moses foreign
[21:55] that with many of them tivan who booked
[21:58] god was not least catholic
[22:02] amen
[22:04] they just said the same manner like uh
[22:09] they drank of the same rock
[22:12] they they they sang when they crossed
[22:14] the red seas
[22:17] all of them recognized moses so the
[22:19] prophet was a
[22:20] prophet but never achieved
[22:23] are you all talking about going to the
[22:24] promised land
[22:55] [Music]
[23:21] so any church in this world can you say
[23:22] your name that opens the bible to read
[23:25] as they are as their references
[23:28] they preach the truth
[23:31] even though they are
[23:33] their denominations
[24:15] that if only they can
[24:44] but the word is
[25:04] [Applause]
[25:44] amen amen
[25:47] but now the demarcation comes in here
[25:49] kathy
[25:51] oh
[25:53] the separating line
[25:58] the boundary was here
[26:01] and that boundary maybe it was not a
[26:02] physical boundary
[26:05] it was not even a visible boundary
[26:19] does not look at the outward appearance
[26:44] [Music]
[26:50] one thing is
[27:35] [Music]
[27:48] was the last book
[27:51] was the last castle of moses
[27:55] before moses dies
[27:58] and then before they inherited from
[27:59] islam
[28:14] to enter into the
[28:43] there are so many things that are going
[28:44] to happen what are we doing
[28:46] there are people who are going to
[28:47] neglect or despise the prophets
[28:52] but there's a group of people never
[28:54] welcome in your carbon amen
[28:56] who are going to
[29:10] they will not care
[29:22] i believe i'm talking to some people
[29:23] here
[30:04] [Applause]
[30:06] of the situations
[30:35] some of the very fundamental things
[30:41] the holy the holy laws of god
[30:44] and how they ought to be you know to to
[30:46] fear god
[30:48] take a
[31:02] he also gives blessings
[31:05] to the 12 tribes of israel
[31:09] if you uh maybe sometimes look at those
[31:12] blessings of moses
[31:16] some of them were even not contradicting
[31:18] but somehow
[31:20] they were bringing in grace
[31:24] to some of the tribes
[31:27] than the ones that jacob had given
[31:50] [Music]
[31:55] he was not even given any blessing
[31:58] amen because of what he had done or
[32:00] whatever you're calling but when moses
[32:01] is blessing them
[32:04] in deuteronomy chapter 33
[32:07] is given a blessing
[32:10] hallelujah so it's a wonderful book but
[32:14] it's not about where you become from
[32:17] it's not how you are in the beginning
[32:22] like reuben what he did
[32:25] him to be judged
[32:54] that is to show you that in this journey
[32:57] of grace
[32:59] you start with condemnation
[33:02] when you recognize you are seen
[33:05] when you recognize you are not worthy
[33:07] you are in the condition of
[33:22] will be better than your
[33:50] hallelujah
[34:04] position
[34:18] hallelujah
[34:21] and now
[34:23] it came to where the the place that's
[34:25] called espana
[34:30] and the people suggested to moses
[35:00] to the promise that they went to israel
[35:05] and they came back with a report
[35:08] and the initial reports
[35:11] good among all of them
[35:14] because
[35:27] [Applause]
[35:32] [Music]
[35:37] [Music]
[35:48] [Music]
[35:56] my generous name is a bible they came
[35:59] with the fruit of the land but genetic
[36:00] arabic amen
[36:02] hallelujah hallelujah and i believe all
[36:05] of us here
[36:06] is that no i know long as you've been in
[36:07] the message church
[36:10] at least you
[36:19] [Music]
[36:48] we want to classify the you know that
[36:50] which is a great blessing and a you know
[36:53] a blessing that can be despised
[37:00] many times to do that
[37:03] i mean if someone came and just are just
[37:04] a you know testified here i want to
[37:06] write there now
[37:20] and i just
[37:21] [Music]
[37:34] at the end of the day
[38:11] [Music]
[38:17] look at me
[38:19] i want to tell you one day when i was in
[38:21] uganda here come baboon are you going to
[38:23] uganda i did a level in ballet at one
[38:25] time
[38:27] i lived
[38:28] one year in a few months
[38:31] there was a time all the food in the
[38:32] house was finished
[38:36] we were renting a place prior to
[38:38] inaccuracies
[38:41] so all the food got finished
[38:46] no rice no nothing no matter what it can
[38:48] be including the kerosene for the la for
[38:51] the for the stuff now i'm afraid
[38:54] when we left in the morning we didn't
[38:55] have anything in the house
[39:02] we were going to stay you know just and
[39:04] maybe in the evening to go and look for
[39:06] a friend we can try to
[39:08] probably together
[39:11] [Music]
[39:13] but somehow along the way just before we
[39:15] reached home
[39:18] lo and behold there was a piece of sugar
[39:20] cane on the side
[39:25] and we pretended like you were playing
[39:27] football with him
[39:30] just like that
[39:33] you're doing it very well my brother
[39:36] until you reach here there are no people
[39:41] what do you think i want to say
[39:45] yes he had lunch
[39:47] prophecy
[39:48] and we were not born again we are not
[39:50] even saved
[39:53] but i remember we watched it means you
[39:55] can approach it and we gave thanks to
[39:56] god
[39:58] and because i was doing something called
[39:59] divinity i don't know it's still there
[40:02] and we were studying about christian
[40:04] living hope in the class
[40:22] ate by thanksgiving we dried my chicken
[40:25] within a short while
[40:28] somebody came from kenya
[40:30] kenya we were not expecting him
[40:32] he never said he was coming
[40:35] and that was the end of our problems
[41:00] [Applause]
[41:04] oh out of faith
[41:06] so deuteronomy extremely traumatic
[41:10] express also the condition that was done
[41:11] in the wilderness
[41:14] things that these people went through
[41:17] and when they brought the evidence that
[41:20] the land was there
[41:23] and even the fruit of that land
[41:26] amen i mean
[41:28] but the the majority again i went to
[41:31] singapore the 10 out
[41:41] [Music]
[42:00] the word of god concerning
[42:13] hallelujah
[42:14] amen hallelujah
[42:17] amen i mean
[42:19] but now the ending point the starting
[42:22] shot of these 10 guys
[42:26] oh it was that thing we said last time
[42:28] about
[43:36] and the evidence is
[44:07] men never said by money their faces were
[44:09] you know just horrible
[44:12] [Music]
[44:14] and when these ten spies they twelve
[44:16] they looked uh you know in comparison
[44:24] [Music]
[44:33] the grapes the fruits
[45:00] [Music]
[45:32] it's actually because of that weakness
[45:34] or wonderful world enough that god chose
[45:36] you yes
[45:38] amen
[45:40] don't we sit by david
[45:42] the other brothers who are bigger
[45:45] [Music]
[46:25] god
[46:26] [Music]
[47:37] but even my mind cannot accept that but
[47:40] then linda was a younger branch
[47:46] was maybe at most 45kg
[48:22] [Music]
[48:28] amen
[48:29] just like jesus i assume when we see his
[48:32] picture what
[48:34] he looks a very nice man
[48:37] you know with a nice face
[48:40] with a nice shave
[48:43] you know where i need
[48:44] for now who can walk in the streets of
[48:46] namu gonna go
[48:57] [Music]
[49:00] that's
[49:28] the streets
[50:00] that in the wilderness
[50:03] now they had someone had tried the
[50:04] preproach of christ
[50:06] someone had to take oh moon
[50:10] the reproach of christ
[50:13] and stand against the others
[50:17] and say regardless
[50:20] of the structure of these men
[50:24] but we are more than
[50:33] [Music]
[50:36] [Applause]
[50:45] [Applause]
[50:51] [Music]
[51:21] steal the people before moses
[51:25] and say let us go up at once
[51:30] hallelujah
[51:32] let us go up at once
[51:35] and possess it and see to delete that we
[51:37] are well able to overcome it
[51:41] hallelujah
[51:43] let us go up at once
[51:46] let us not sit around and try to argue
[52:02] with your
[53:10] let us go up at once
[53:25] hey let us preach together
[53:29] let us say
[53:31] let me go up at once
[53:35] let me go up at once
[53:37] where
[53:38] to my possession a really angry
[54:22] hallelujah i mean go preaching yourself
[54:25] that at home gain anger wherever we need
[54:27] to engineer you as you shall be on the
[54:28] right door
[54:30] preach to yourself

[54:36] encourage
[54:40] [Music]
[54:50] joshua
[55:24] amen
[55:26] you're just being returned to your own
[55:28] possession oh democrat is a video you
[55:30] are going back your possession for your
[55:32] video
[56:27] i don't see your situation now i can't
[56:30] see your condition see that i'm better i
[56:32] don't care what you can tell me this has
[56:34] happened
[56:36] all i care about belongs to you
[56:40] i'm willing the land is yours
[56:51] oh i feel like telling the devil
[57:24] [Music]
[57:40] [Applause]
[57:48] amen
[57:49] hallelujah amen amen
[57:53] [Music]
[57:56] amen amen oh the lord is good
[58:01] this is why we are here today my brother
[58:03] pass
[58:06] amen i mean you have to be delivered
[58:08] it's to be free
[58:10] to worship our god
[58:12] to worship god
[58:14] praise god
[58:18] we don't care about the devil to god
[58:20] satan we don't care about his
[58:23] intentions the two fights can be a gala
[58:26] he is already defeated
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] amen i mean oh let's just go for the
[58:33] lord
[59:30] amen but
[59:32] that never stopped him
[59:36] from being the prophet of the age
[59:41] amen i mean maybe i have my own
[59:44] declarations
[59:58] yo
[1:00:26] you know they'll be angry
[1:00:29] other preachers will be angry
[1:00:32] in this generation
[1:00:36] say those words of the prophet
[1:00:40] even if you take me to hell
[1:00:53] and if i'm following the prophet and
[1:00:56] maybe you went to hell
[1:00:59] in the lord
[1:01:02] amen amen
[1:01:04] so i don't have any discussions with
[1:01:06] people on that that is
[1:01:37] they were separating themselves from god
[1:01:40] and therefore they were leaving the
[1:01:41] peace of god
[1:01:43] the joy of the lord is
[1:01:45] and now they are putting themselves in
[1:01:47] the hands of saturn
