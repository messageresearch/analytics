Christ pray [Applause] amen praise the Lord shall we turn to our Bibles this morning yeah we have uh it's quite a long reading but we shall see how we are going to go about it turn to First [Music] Samuel chapter 17 yeah it is if you have during your free time you can read the whole chapter amen I'll read uh I begin from I read the first verse then I'll jump okay and now the Philistine gathered together their armies to battle and were gathered together uh at at at shoko which belongeth to Judah and pitched between shoko and AA in in fadin and Saul and the men of Israel were were gathered together and pitched by the valley of Ella and set the battle in aray against the fisan and the fisan stood on mountain on the on one side and Israel stood on on mountain on other side and there was a valley between them and there went out and they went out a champion out of the champion of the Philistines named Goliath of goth whose height was six chit and a span then I'm going to uh to read verses okay let for okay and he had an element of brass his head and he was armed with a coat of nail of mail and the weight of the Court was 5,000 shakles of brass and he had and he had gves of breast upon his legs and target of brass between his shoulders and the STA of his spear was like wers wers beam and his Spear's head weighed 600 shackles of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and Cried unto the armies of Israel and said unto them why are you come out to set your battle in aray I'm not a Philistine and ye servant to Saul shoose you shoose you a man for you and let him come down to me if he be able to fight with me and to kill me then will be your servant but if I Prevail against him and kill him then shall he be our servant and [Music] servers [Music] for for [Music] for amen am praise the Lord yeah precious father in the name of Jesus we thank you Lord for the reading of the word we ask you Lord to anoint your word I pray that you come and give us the inspiration this morning may you direct this word to the heart of the rightful people Lord thou knowest our needs Lord and you said your word is sharper than any two May the Holy Spirit move this word that by the end of this service Goliath in our lives will be defeated the Bible says that when you send your word it will not to you f but it will do what you have sent it for Jesus name we pray you may have your seat praise the Lord are you fine this morning has the Lord been so good to you God is good yeah to only two three people but I'm very sure by the end of the service you will know that God is good to each one of us blessed be the name of the Lord amen today by the grace of God we are going to talk about Goliath and David I know it's not your first time to hear [Music] it when I was told that I would stand today that has always been the hardest time of my life you wonder what will I tell the people but I trust when if you've been praying God is going to speak to you amen sometimes it's not because you are lacking what to [Music] say but maybe because you have a lot to say but the best way is to wait upon the Lord amen and this morning I'm going to uh to preach the message pre by the prophet he called it the great warrior David amen great warrior David is quite a wonderful sermon the Bible tells us to confort one another with these words and I know all of us know that we are in the battle we are fighting the Lord's battle in the battle we are fighting the victory is already attained amen there are many sermons which the prophet preach alongside that [Music] line Talk of the Mighty the Great and Mighty conqueror the great warrior Joshua amen showing us how Jesus conquered Satan blessed be the name of the Lord and this morning we are going to look at the great warrior David anointed man in the hand of God praise the Lord remember this scripture where we have read for all you Bible readers that during the the time of Israelites when they on their way to the promised land there are series of things which happen alongside the way and remember when where God met Moses when we go back and we see the Promise God gave to Abraham how would bring his children out of Egypt take them to the promised land blessed be the name of the Lord and that promise took so long and we know how Israel were in Egypt they were sold in slavery blessed be the name of the Lord and the Bible says one day God met Moses and told him I have heard the Cry of my children praise be to God this where they are always crying reading the word and they knew one day God would fulfill his promise when God prophesy something it cannot fail because the Bible says the word of God is a seed and when the seed is s in the ground just it the right atmosphere it must germinate amen so this morning just prepare your heart let your heart be the right ground for the seed the word of God Amen and remember alongside their way when they're moving on their way they reached somewhere and they converted the uh the foreign tribes because they had the Kings because their King they not seeing their King God was their King amen but when they were moving in their Journey they realized their opponent had Kings and you know how kings are treated you know how they are how their subjects goes and bore before them look at the Kingdom we having like the kingdom of buganda Amen when the king is going to visit a certain place they said the King has desired you don't call the king that have invited the king of that might to come and visit me it is his desire to come and visit me amen amen it is the king who desires to come and visit you when the king is going to visit I'm telling you they will decorate every [Applause] amen the all of that week or two weeks one month brother sister they will be doing rehearsals in choir and each and everything everywhere learn dances why King has desired to visit when these people saw something of that kind they admired and they started to demand for the king also blessed be the name and that was the greatest mistake which they made because God was their King he the King of Kings and the Lord of lords of host he's the mighty warrior the champion of all Champions just imagine these people they were now rejecting the champion of all champions for us we want the one which is the one who is trained by men blessed be the name of the Lord and here we are seeing after I'm just trying to give you the background of it and when they rejected God and they asked for the king and and SEL was so grieving he went before the Lord and cried before the Lord and God told him give them the king they have not rejected you but they have rejected me and that's why Samuel was crying because remember the word of God comes to the Prophet The Prophet comes to us with the mind of God already knew the mind of God toward Israel and when they rejected God by asking for the King Samuel knew that trouble was coming blessed be the name of the Lord remember last time when we were talking about Samuel how he was sent to go and slay the enemies sorry sa thank you sa when he reached there he he slew some and spared some where was that mistake coming from it was not God's will for them to have the king sa was the choice of men blessed be the name of the Lord and here we are seeing now Trouble When God gave them the king when when people demanded for the king God gave them the king because they rejected him and then they chose soul because he was big man he was giant man with high shoulders maybe had even our enemies should start crying blessed be the name of the Lord and if you read this scripture and you see how things went on Israel were in battle day after day and the Philistine were against them they had the champion as the Bible said here and the battle was boring because the philis they had a mighty man amen where we have read the Bible says go he had six cubits when I was checking the average normal human being tubit is of two you find it they saw a beast we are going to read again and see hisry blessed be the name of the Lord amen amen amen and here we are seeing when they rejected God and God and samel and God gave them then men chose but in that very time God told Samuel to go and anoint David blessed be the name of the Lord when people chose to be king God chose David to be king amen amen and he had a reason for doing so praise the name of the Lord today I'm going to read several quotes you will bear with me amen but we shall not take long don't worry blessed be the name of the I just wanted to encourage to encourage you this morning say the message the great warri David said that I like to see people who know where they where they are standing who knows what they are talking about now let us move to verses 31 of where we have read 1731 we beginning from 29 and David said okay let's begin let's read from 11 and when soul and all Israel heard those words of philistin they were dismayed and greatly afraid when they told them to choose one man among them now David was the son of David was the son of the ephra of Beth be bethleem Judah whose name was Jesse and he had eight son and and the man went among men for for an old man in the days of Saul and three Elder son of Jesse and and followed Saul to the battle in the name of his three son that went to the battle where eliab the first born and the next unto him ABAB and the third sham the thir was sha and David was the youngest and the three eldest followed Saul but David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem and the Philistine Drew near morning and evening and presented himself 40 days and Jesus said unto David his son take not uh take now for thy Brethren and of this porched Conn and and 10 Loaves and ran to the camp to thy Brethren and carry these 10 cheese andto the captain of their thousands and look how their Brethren fail and take their uh pledges now soul and soul and they now Saul and they and all the men of Israel were in the valley of of Ella fighting with Philistines and he rose up early in the morning and left the ship with the keeper and took and went as Jess had commanded him and he came to the trench as he host uh as the host was going forth to fight and shouted for the battle for Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in AR against AR against Army against Army against Army against Army and David left his courage in the hand of The Keeper of the courage and ran into the army and came and saluted his Brethren and as he talked with them he behold there came up Champion the Philistine of goth Goliath by the name out of the armies of fisan and spake according to the according to the same word and David had them amen hope you have been following blessed be the name of the Lord here we are seeing the sons of Jesse three of them went to fight with for the king and David went and came back then after some time his father prepared some meal and gave David to take to his brother in the battle blessed be the name of the Lord but remember before that David was already anointed amen remember when God told Samuel go in the house of Jesse and anoint one of his son as a king so went and J called all son J had seven sons blessed be the name of the Lord and when the man of God came to anoint this man amen just thought God was going to choose maybe his firstborn as you're going to see it here amen and the man of God was prayed up he was waiting on God Amen and even himself he thought God was going to choose the first or the second so they lined up six of them David was not among them he was in the wilderness riding the father's sheep praise the Lord then this man became they came before the uh the prophet of God the first one came amen maybe he had a kind of a military training you know you know army they I think they amongest the discipline security Personnel I know when you're talking to them they very displ so this man came before the the servant of God and maybe Was preparing to anoint the king the uh the prophet did not know the person to annointed but he was under instruction he was supposed to wait until the Holy Ghost direct him to the right person amen like that s it was during the time of Simeon when Simeon went to the temple there were many mothers with babies Simon was even blind Holy Ghost L Simon where baby J was that's why the prophet says God has given us the Holy Ghost to lead the church amen not Bishops not FP not cardal the Church of the Living God is led by the Holy Ghost because it's the holy ghost that knows the mind of God hallelujah so the man of God was waiting came and maybe Was preparing to do so and the Holy Ghost said no what that one passed the second one came along the third one six1 surely David he was not even Rec I think even by the father because how can they tell you to bring your son that God is going to choose one among them to be the king and you ignore the last one blessed be the name of the Lord God is revealing Simplicity amen just thought this boy because he was well educated if he like today maybe was taken to the best uh the best military school maybe like maybe was in Sunday H where they train the best God said no blessed be the name of the Lord and our Prophet tells us Moses was trained for over 30 years amen having the best military training was the superow of that day but when God met Moses God took Moses to the W to do what to a ship am amen he took him where he knew wor things and he took him in nature amen and God train from more 30 years and the prophet tells us that God was uprooting all whatever Moses had in Egypt Moses did not need what he leared in Egypt to liberate his brothers amen Moses needed the pill of fire glory be to God the church does not need cm to go for R you don't need to do pents to go for Rapture amen yes but you need the Holy Ghost you need a pillar of fire that is the only way to the blessed be the name of the Lord so after the six were done then the I believe the prophet was stranded now because he was Wonder really if you had an idea about David sinc can that boy be a king he might be having crossed legs maybe his legs are funny you know C Keepers usually look like the the bushes do you know that all people resemble their jobs Engineers are rough people because they hold tomato they cutting here cutting there people who work in saloons they look like Jerry they call them mommy all the time they smear you find the one was black is now pink the looks like and they call them aunti even the looks like the Sheep amen amen so David was there amen oh blessed the name of maybe was singing Amazing Grace he didn't know that that day that day he was going to be anointed amen maybe was looking at his cars he he got when he was raring the father's sheep yes he he was looking at the scars he got while fighting with animals and he was thanking God for the great Victory he gave him be the name of the Lord maybe was there singing some good [Music] song how many believe that David was a singer there is no great singer who can David sing they even singing David's song I believe this man was singing Psalms the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want because he was used to that he was The Shepherd of the sheep and when he was there he didn't know the time for promotion had come blessed be the name of the Lord God was moving him froming the ship to become the king of Israel amen I don't know I don't know which brother was sent to go and call David and I believe that brother was not even was not happy blessed be the name of the Lord the prophet says every time you think that you that you have obtained it you have achieved you have got and you needed at home now at this time was taking the ship for water anent the prop was at home the Bible says that was man after God's Own Heart maybe when they mention the prophet is at home that was enough for him to leave whatever he was blessed be the name of the Lord then he came home maybe came crying like sheep and they like disgusting Prophet did God really talk to you God's word can never fa when God speaks amen everything must shut up when God tells that you are free there's no shame there have shame that can hold you say that by you are ill there are no sickness that can hold so David came blessed be the name of the Lord maybe when David arrived the de in the prophet the dep in the prophet started calling the dep in was judging hallelujah hallelujah glory be to God yes you are the one amen then he pulled her on and anointed him anointed him all the oil he didn't put on the the anointing on him amen what and was what he came smiling sheep smelling so bad smelling that childhood kind of you can never know when he last bathed sometimes we when we and Mommy I bathed but you look weird Mama bathed I will only wash my feet that was the man am man anointed in the hand of God amen God looked at the heart of David saw the heart of go the heart of he looked at them God knew end from the beginning he knew that David was the right person to lead Israel amen David was for known by God Amen but the father did not know the secret blessed be the name of the Lord and we seeing David after some time he was now Anointed The Father called him the Bible says 40 days men were in battle and this message the prophet says me Temptation and he say that when after the rain the rain rain for 40 days 40 nights Jesus was for 40 days in the wilderness the battle ra for 40 days that is when David came blessed be the name of the Lord hallelujah I don't know how many days you have suffered I don't know what you're battling with I want to tell you brother sister maybe today is your 4 he sent to bring you some food not only that God knew in David he had enough potential experience to lead the Army blessed be the name of the Lord and when he came and delivered food the Bible says R in the battle brother brother me how do you shoot David was there he saw a beast let us read about this Beast and David was the youngest and uh the youngest and the three eldest son uh three Elders followed so but David went and returned the father okay and David left his carriage in the hand of the Keeper of the courage and RTO the Army and came and saluted his Brethren and as he talked with them behold there came up a champion the philis of goth Goliath by the name out of the armies of the Philistine and spake according to the same word and David had them that was the worst mistake that devil did that day David had the Blasphemous word of the and all the men of Israel when they saw the man fleed from him and were so afraid and the men of Israel said have you seen this man that is come up Sur to defy Israel is he come up and shall it be that he that that the man who kth him the king will enish him with great richness and will give him his daughter David had heard about the rumors when he came maybe he used to be in the ship but he would admire the King's Daughter and then he would take a heart have you ever seen a sister and you would want to go to her but because when you measure you maybe you're still in school not yet stable okay let me go look for money amen David came and had room and this is it true that the king said the man who will come and fight that will enrich him bonus of the daughter amen mhm and then and the men of Israel said have you seen this man okay and they respect the men that stood by him saying what shall be done uh what shall be done to the man that k thise came asking David wanted confirmation he did not want to go to battle when the sister is not part of the Victory and uh and take away the reproach from Israel for who is okay and David spoke to the man and stood by him and saying what shall be done to the man that kill this Palestine and taketh away the reproach from Israel for who is this uncircumcised now he started weighing that he should defy the armies of the Living God he was uncircumcised your enemies are uncircumcised and David saw that had not seen that why it was People's Choice but the one which God shows he had the Revelation and when he came in the battle and we his enemy remember before you face your enemy you have to First Look for his Wicked yes sir the devil will never tempt you the devil will never tempt you with bear that your weakness is women he knows your weakest Point your point of weakness as a child of God is your greatest point of strength so when David looked at go he saw this man is even nothing imagine even before he started he was check according to the word of Isel according to the people that can attack he said this man is not circum he doesn't even know the pain of how can he speak amen amen and the people answered answered him after this man saying so shall it be done to the man that now see here and his eldest brother when he spoke unto the men was King against David and he said why thou down and with whom hast thou left those fish sheeps in the wildness I know th bright you see kind of brother attacking spiritual brother they tell us they dream dreams you are the one who dream dreams brother I dream you God sh me instead of humbling yourself you cannot manage goath we know your pride he even the other kind of because remember he's the the first born now the last born was anointed it wasn't David's making it was the will of God was God's election it was God's purpose amen nothing can fail the purpose of God in your life not death blessed be the name of the Lord amen whatever God sanction in the beginning until eternity bless the name of the Lord amen and why come th down I Know Thy pride and th nness and th nness of thine heart for thou Thou come down that thou see the battle and David said what what have I done to you the one was mad because know my brother what just to ask for the reward to the even somebody to come and save you now what have I done to you baba amen it is very interesting amen amen and uh and David said now I have done this that was after okay 29 [Music] 29 yes and he and he turned from from him toward another and spake after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former manner wanted to confirm do you know marrying King's Daughter the king had voted to give out the says when he went to another one is it true said yes 31 and when these words were heard which David spoke they rehearsed them before sa and he sent for him the king said sincer bring that man and we see you never know and David said to Saul let no man's heart fail because of him David was anointed brother be anointed us be anointed and the devil will face it R anointed by the Holy Ghost amen so remember in olden days it was the king to lead the battle you remember and yat the one leading the B and then the rest followed so now the king the young man is telling the king maybe did not have an idea that this man was anointed but the Bible says that anointing breaks y this was a yoke un Israel did not know that the anointing in David can break this y amen amen so said to David okay not be afraid of them thy servant will go and fight with this philis we shall go amen servant shall go for you you have failed the one which the regions failed people would commit adultery with with rosaries amen amen am they are putting on a rosary but they are they they exping somebody's H wife they put on gos and they always in shines amen amen but David he came from the telling the don't worry I will not you will not die your servant is going to fight with the philes oh courage was telling us about fear amen David had no fear because he had the spirit of God Brother Martin you mean in all those days they were filled with the Holy Spirit no but the anointing was a s of the Holy Ghost he was anointed with the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord and turn him toward and and David said unto sa okay and sa said to David thou not able to go against pH to fight with him for thou but a [Music] youth and he a man of war from his youth Timothy let nobody despise your you amen the King was despising David's youth amen what does the first letter of John say as it is talking about it says that we are might in David he had the greater one he was young yes but he had Christ in him amen and after the king had spoken to him David was not frightened listen to what he told the king and said unto sa the servant kept his father's sheep and the lion came and came a lion and a bear and took a lamb out of the flock and I went after him David could Chase these animals and smot him and delivered it out of his mouth and when he rose against me I CAU him by his beard and smot him and slew him M thy servant slew both The Lion and the beard that the king had never killed even a rat was like [Music] what do you know how heavy a bear is yes I know because I somebody never F something can describe the strength and the height single it is fire who told you blessed is the name of the Lord amen maybe it may not be easy but the grace of God is sufficient so the man told him his testimony the Bible tells us amen praise the Lord and forget not his testimonies brother sister the same God who saved your soul God is able to save from another problem amen amen David used the other testimonies to put down the giant praise be to God so he gave the king his testimony and the prophet says oh how I love to hear such men who speak about what they know amen they know where they are standing they know what they talking about where they talking about the Holy Ghost it is because they were there they received him they were no matter how much you doubt the holy spirit is not real you what have you said don't know what you're talking about now you don't know what you're talking about imagin but the one was you know what you're talking about this is experience amen that change the to had a testimony testimony he knew what he was talking about blessed be the name of the Lord so when he challenged the king and then then thy servant slew both of the lion and the bear and bear and this uncircumcised philistin shall be as one of them seeing he hath defiled the armies of the Living God Amen even the one who is circumcised he will be like the animals that I [Music] slew because he defying the armies of the Lord amen amen David said moreover the Lord ha delivered me out of the PE of lion and out of the PE of the bear he will deliver me out of the hand of this Philistine and Saul said David go and the Lord be with [Music] you that was not the common testimony amen the King was impressed and said maybe in his heart if this young man slew the bear and the lion he might try you never know was feeling very angry he the one who was anointed king now he's going in the battle blessed the name of the Lord amen and armed David now listen with his armor and he put element of brass upon his head and also the AR arm him with a c of ma and every his sword uh uh his sword upon Him upon his armor and I say to go for he had not proved it and David said unto sa I cannot go with this for I have not proven them you here there is something there putting on they gave him a very heavy sword those days they could put on Helm and you could hardly carry a Helm if you're not a soldier but David told him this element I'm not yet and he turned from he from him toward another and spoke after the same manner and the people answered him again after the former oh sorry and he took the stuff and and chose him five okay and said okay and David C his what and David said unto Saul I cannot go with this I can't take catechism in heaven for I have not proven them and David put them of him when Christ called us we undressed religion we removed the Witchcraft you can't confront the devil when you're moving with such things put them off and see the victory of the Lord and D put them off amen and he took his stuff in his hand St out of the brook smoth Stone out of the brook if you have everen we would we would use mud you could get clay and then you mold small rounding things they could be like stones but they were molden from clay and you put them you dry them on the sun when they dry up we could use them when we are slingshot like when we are using maybe the slingshots amen amen David was acquainted with nature tactics were natural blessed be the name of the Lord praise the Lord I want to take some quotes here and David from very beginning of his days born he was on this Earth he knew that God was with him before he was ever blessed or anointed he knew God was with him if you watch the story real close if you watch the story real close if you watch David's story real close amen last was speaking on the same thing that gifts and calling are without repentance inection and for knowledge it is what make things so we have a desire the Bible says it's not him that we live or him that run the god showy am you're not here because you wanted you're not here because you were so but God just had mercy on you amen God God's election and for knowledge is what make things so we have a desire the Bible says it's not him that will him that run amen you will you you will oh whether you want or where you desire is it's where it God is okay it's not where your will is or where your desire is it is God's will or not then when we have to find out God's way and if and that is perfect we can just set our faith to that and say that is it amen but they went down and shows a king they wanted to act like the rest of the nation like the Gentile and God was their King but they wanted to act like the rest of the people that was the mistake they made God is our King God want to leave the church want to leave a Believer many times cling to things which are used less education will never take you to heaven education is good for us on Earth but it's not our absolute amen I have met people who Brak about do you know how many years you take when you are learning when you want to become a priest seven years you in the monaster running or in the seven years but when you passed out the first day you learn on the ppit you baptizing a baby after studying for seven years you see amen blessed the name of the Lord so they chose themselves a king and they went then they got in trouble when you try to impersonate someone else forou something has just come to me when Ahab wanted to go to the battle and All His prophets the seven of them they say thus says the Lord the Bible say the head of his of his he would put on hor amen and said with this H you are going to push the enemy blessed the name of the Lord amen the Lord he feared God according to the Bible the Bible says he was a righteous man remember anointed

without a Shepherd didn't I tell you why I didn't want to all he is the one contrary he said get that door put him in prison give him a bread of dishonest the bread of tribulation until said dear King your majesty when you return alive the Lord would have not spoken with me he was confident he knew what he was talking about he knew where he was standing he was sure that God spoke to him God was not going in that battle Amen to stand on what you are the word has come from God and he will not return what he did told you know what you should do let me put on youring and he put on mind and he went to battle when they reach in battle they declare because God had not allowed them to go they said fight no one unless the king of Israel brother sister my brother my sister he was feel he felt discouraged remember put they chased they chased him he drove his Chariot whatever he would look enemies he said I'm not the king I'm not the king the king is there in that garment the Bible says they pierced and they put him on the car as they returning the king died you see it started long way when they asked for King things went on moving badly praise the Lord so the prophet say that but now Israel wanted to impersonate other people and that is what the church want to do personate become a backing condition amen But as God said to man look on the out appear God look at on the heart God looked at the of David that he was the great warrior he would manage that battle but looked at the out blessed be the name of the Lord and when isra selected their King when they selected sa they wanted a great big handsome strong looking fellow with big shoulders standing ahead and showed us above all of his family when God selected his King for them slapping looking kind of fellow look like a a little sister and that is what God picked out of it oh what a difference amen sometime God does things in the way to what we think that is going to that case you are going to die with TB how can they ever get well that is the doctor's opinion he's looking at it from medical standpoint but now from God standpoint amen that is how God looks at things but if the doctor say it is finished and you don't believe it because God said something different watch what will happen wisdom versus face blessed be the name of the Lord amen [Music] the prophet say here that see but Human Side the human the

the Holy Ghost will not come but when the comforter will come he will lead to all the truth and when we receive the Holy Ghost he has is guiding us into the truth he has revealed us a lot of things blessed be the name of the Lord amen so David was anointed he was in the hands of God and when he went to the battle he realized there was a need there goath never knew that Israel had a visitor who
