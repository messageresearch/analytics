same yesterday and today and forever yes christo jones so this evening i'm speaking on the sixth sense get cents it's really a continuation and i'm speaking today on [Music] and let us read from verse one and we will read most of the chapter all of the chapters and i want you to be attentive tonight baby tara because you believe that faith is a substance through faith we understand that the words were framed by the word of god so that things which are seen we are not made of things which do appear on so whatever was made was not made out of the things that we see it was made of things which do not appear that you have offered unto god a more excellent sacrifice by which he obtained witness that he was righteous god testifying of his gifts and by it being dead yet speak it is not seen as yet moved with fear prepared an ark to the saving of his house by the which he come condemned the world and became here of the righteousness which is by faith notice that all these people were able to please god by faith please god by faith [Music] according to you you you prepare yourself according to the message you can go back that is faith like noah was saved in his entire fight by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went away again as in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with eyes i can jack up the hairs with him of the same promise [Music] we looked for a city now i'll just read through brother before he looked for us listen for he looked for a city which had had foundations whose builder and america is gone through faith also sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised there are for sprang sprang there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in the in the in multitude and as the sand which is by the sea show innumerable these all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them afar off and we are persuaded of them and embraced them and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country where from whence they came out they might have had opportunity to have returned but now they desired a better country that is unheavenly hallelujah whereas for god is not ashamed to be called their god for he has prepared for them a city by faith abraham when he was tried offered up isaac and he had received the promises offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that god was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure by faith isaac blessed jacob and essel concerning things to come by faith jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worship and jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of joseph and worshipped leaning upon the tops of his staff by faith joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of israel and gave commandment concerning his bonds listen by faith moses when he was born was he three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect and through the recompense of the reward are you listening church by faith he forsook egypt not fearing the wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the first born should touch them by faith they passed through the red sea as by dry land which the egyptians are saying to do were drawn by faith the words of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the hard rahab perished not with them that believed not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall i most say for the time would fail me to tell of gideon and of barrack and of samson and object jefferson of david also and samuel and all the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms righteousness obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quest the violence of fire escape the edge of the sword out of weakness we're made strong what's variant in fight turn to flight the armies of the eye aliens women received their dead rays to life again and others were tortured not accepting deliverance they might obtain a better resurrection and others had tried of cruel mockings and stolens yeah moreover bones and imprisonment they were stoned they were sowed asunder we are tempted we are slain with swole they were they wandered about in sheep's skin and got skin being destitute africa tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wanted in deserts and in mountains and in dens and in caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise god having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect when you read this uh hebrews 11 you know you know somewhere in the bible it says that i think it says in the book of hebrews it says that if joshua had given them rest what was this to mean that that rest that was remaining was the sabbath race because actually in the book in the category says for if jesus had given them rest then he wouldn't have talked of another day but you see there he was meaning joshua joshua did not give these people rest yes about you when moses brought them out of egypt mushrooms joshua took them into the promised land yesterday and they believed on god they were ready underwater they suffered the rest of their soul already just submitted after fighting for years and years after going to whatever we have gone through in the days and the three times of your neighbor to your same withdrawal we are going it's now rest from our works the works of sins and he came and he said come unto me already that labour and the heavy light and i'll give you rest about it we have read about here men and women of faith really spoke of him by faith they did what they did by faith he never obtained a promise but [Music] abraham believed in the resurrection even if i give my son god is able to raise him up again but yet god had never requested for child sacrifice god had never requested for human sacrifice you read your bible that's the only sacrifice god has never asked for my bible but because jesus christ died in your strength yes yes you're the only human that has ever died to your career as a sacrifice for sin that's a darker yes that we may be able to surrender ourselves [Music] [Music] our faith must be built on something and today in the service i will take one example here already another in chapter 11 of john masoli and i'd like you to look at it yes our faith must have a basis jesus christ the same yesterday and today and foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] he started you did not get yourself here by your own abilities you didn't even get yourself here because of somebody else it is because of him or your years because of christ it is [Applause] [Music] now a certain man was sick named lazarus of bethany the town of mary and her sister mother you remember this mary is the same woman that bowed to the feet of jesus and washed jesus's feet with her own tears i love it when jesus is not in connection with only me but with my family hey man then he has a more reason to come to your rescue song is look at verse 3 says it was that mary which anointed the lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother lazarus was sick therefore his sister sent unto him saying lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick now jesus was not only friends with mary and martha but was also a friend with lazarus and when they were sending for jesus listen uh friends of jesus we are telling jesus about his friends with [Music] [Music] [Applause] so the way they wrote the letter was anger when they come up with the lord whom thou love is too sick when jesus heard that he said [Applause] that he was sick he aborted two days still in the same place where he went up he think about it look at it this way should have been what tell us jesus loved luanga and his wives and his children yes they were in trouble he because they loved them [Music] [Music] he is trying to tell them i'll get that cup again in your situation you may not see me but i am going to turn that banana you may not feel me but i am are you going to complete you may not uh when i'm feeling like puking hallelujah i mean because i feel the way i've seen it i'm pretty random when i'm putting that doesn't mean god disapproves of me neither are the bright skies and still water signs of his love and approval oh which he had for us before the foundation of the world does he love us oh yes but how shall we know no because he said so and he manifested that he did love us for he brought us to himself and gave us of his spirit blessing us as sons he died on the messiah and he brought us to himself there is nothing that can prove his love more than that oh [Applause] [Music] is [Music] hallelujah amen oh my my my hallelujah amen amen the devil is going to be in drought after this is and that's why we cannot leave him because we were in him before the trial praise the lord we can leave things but we cannot leave him up that's how you prove your love to him [Applause] [Music] for five years by connecting yourself with hallelujah [Music] magazine i thought i should go through this even when all my other fellows have gone ahead of me in his wisdom he thought i should be at this stage [Music] [Music] do you understand oh my name who you are sorry if only you knew you were not mandatory you would not behave that to a brother the one that is never too old to have that my sister said what you might not matter what you are going through be joyful so you can appreciate god wherever the catholics are allowing those priests to come hallelujah hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music] he doesn't is amen they wanted to kill you buddy those jews are not easy no of course yet after two days now this is the third day so he wants to go back because he has to [Music] you know it's amazing that god allows certain things to happen around you which will make the devil think cathy being trained in everyday understand your clothes jesus could never come back again god allows it to be there now so that he's coming at you you see it allows things to happen again heading to 92 for his glory okay so everybody's fearing to go back [Music] jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever yes we need to understand things that happened to me to work out will not happen he amen but if a man walk in the light in the night humbling yes it's going to walk without christ because there is no light in him [Music] [Applause] [Music] had spoken of taking rest what happened then said jesus unto them plainly yes lazarus is dead you know many times god speaks to us but we don't understand why we don't believe that together because our mind is so narrow cranking those have fame funded his word is so brutal we need to have faith is [Music] that's he knew that jesus was hunted there you see sometimes we [Applause] have [Applause] then when jesus came and found that he had laid in the grave four days already yes now bethany was night now unto jerusalem bethsania company and many of the jews came to martha and mary to comfort them concerning their brothers as soon as she heard that jesus was coming mary's the way i would've danced yesterday i went and met him not too can i am saying that mary sat still in the house it doesn't matter whether you run to go meet him or whether you're in the house he is sincere what jesus was yes we are he did not change say yeah praise the lord come here praise the lord let's follow still here now that's a beautiful story and many of the jews all right now then said master unto jesus lord come on jesus christ is the same yesterday today if you hadn't been here singing that is he was speechless all right it would have been good let me let me skip here so i can get to that quote for you hamburger i want to when mata ran to find jesus i'm reading from uh uh from the supersets praise the lord how many of us do it when martha ran to find jesus that we had to calavera and when she said lord whatever you revelation at that moment by saying lord i wish you were here oh what people thought could not be changed the all right nina praise the lord come here okay surprise says there is a 60 cents i know even now whatsoever i will ask of god god will give it money jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise unto him but her last words there probably began prove a lack of faith for what god could do even now yeah i know he will rise in the resurrection she lacked faith she lacked a revelation yes of that moment you know we have all the sorts of promises god has made to us but we will always push them in the future [Music] out say it with two years lord i believe helped my anvil okay lord i believe helped [Music] right yeah okay but the man said i believe i'm such a gunman's [Music] that you don't need even much faith in some of these things you had faith like a seed of a mustard masala [Music] you can tell a mountain to people from [Music] yes i believe but that's not what god is requiring god requires us to have faith without faith it is impossible to please him now what is faith faith is a revelation hallelujah praise the name of god when did matthew demonstrate faith marriage [Music] even now now remember one day i was going to uh i was going to go to god god god gave me a vision that's where i was supposed to go i did not know the place better um you know supposed to help me guide me to go there enough to go to the manager with a vision very clearly it's the substance of things and it's not in you if you notice this girl master anything go back with yourself you shall be done i want you to also be like look at the lord not yourself i told you on sunday faith is not a working app okay oh and if it is going to work for the rapture but you know what he is also going to work for our day to day amen hallelujah i mean and then jesus said unto her yes um he's [Applause] [Music] be selfish go call somebody else that's how you are able to know someone is really convinced dragging their friends to church let me tell you the moment you begin to see anybody dragging their friend to chat botanica then you know that person is really convinced [Music] but if if you see somebody you know they're in church but but you don't even know who their friends are never whatever you can drag nobody and some of them are preachers today and i tell you what church you two need to do the same thing now put your friends to church you are not going to give them the revelation again about faith is she loves the feet so much whenever she said jesus she ran for this welcome why don't you love mary mariamo i love mary mary she was so humble yeah i think she was hallelujah [Music] threw it with you [Music] which opened the eyes of the blah blah blah of course that even this man should not have died that's what he just wanted [Music] [Music] something in me while watching tomorrow it's going to rise up yes lord i need you in my life it was a cave yard [Music] i don't care how far you've gone yo you may be dead but god wanted you to be in that condition for him to manifest his glory i only sent you too much four days jesus said unto him say thy not to see that if how many feet are tingling let me cover with it out that moment when everything seems to have failed when he even was supposed to be a savior he's weeping and crying he begins to
