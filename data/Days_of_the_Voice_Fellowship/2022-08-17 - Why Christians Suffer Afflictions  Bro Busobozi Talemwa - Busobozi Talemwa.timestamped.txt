[11:35] us let us begin s
[11:38] father this is our prayer tonight
[11:43] sometimes the way down here gets wrong
[11:51] things become difficult and not easy
[11:55] but we know that the god of the man of
[11:59] the valleys is also the god of the
[12:01] mountain and the god of the mountain is
[12:03] [Music]
[12:09] [Music]
[12:15] [Music]
[12:16] we have come here tonight to recognize
[12:20] that you have given us the gift of life
[12:25] [Music]
[12:26] and we want you to speak to us we
[12:34] [Music]
[12:40] I pray
[12:43] much
[12:49] in your name Jesus Christ amen
[12:55] [Music]
[12:58] I'd like to reach you all in the name of
[13:00] Jesus Christi
[13:16] with you
[13:20] I'd like you to open in the Book of
[13:22] Psalms
[13:29] 34 this is
[13:37] we just read one verse out of there and
[13:39] then we also read in the Book of Matthew
[13:42] foreign
[14:18] the righteous cry and the Lord Hearth
[14:21] and delivereth them out of all their
[14:24] troubles
[14:25] the Lord is now unto them that are over
[14:27] a broken heart and seventh church as be
[14:30] of a contrite spirit many are the
[14:33] afflictions of the righteous but the
[14:35] Lord delivereth him out of them all
[14:38] right
[14:49] foreign
[15:30] this evening by the grace of God
[15:35] I'd like to ask a question
[15:38] and I cannot see you Brother Sam so if
[15:42] you can come and take the city
[15:47] all right so
[15:49] um
[15:53] why Christians suffer afflictions
[15:58] maybe to make it a question I would say
[16:00] why do Christians suffer afflictions
[16:03] [Music]
[16:06] do Christians suffer afflictions
[16:11] so why do they this
[16:14] so but maybe my title tonight will be in
[16:19] a form of a question but really a
[16:20] statement why Christians suffer
[16:22] Affliction
[16:24] is
[16:31] I know there are many who say that
[16:34] Christians should not
[16:36] suffering
[16:39] and that if you suffer it is a sign that
[16:42] God does not love you and that you are
[16:44] cast
[16:53] so tonight I'd like to get into this
[16:56] subject and see how much we shall be
[16:58] able to get into all right
[17:04] um and maybe I'll continue with it
[17:05] another time if I don't get to finish it
[17:10] now the sculpture this is David speaking
[17:14] he said many are the afflictions not
[17:18] some or few other afflictions but he
[17:21] said many are the afflictions of the
[17:23] righteous
[17:32] but then it says but the Lord delivereth
[17:35] him out of them all well
[17:41] no matter how many afflictions we will
[17:43] go through before we even continue on
[17:45] the subject we have an assurance that
[17:47] the Lord will deliver you from all your
[17:50] afflictions
[18:16] so Matthew 14 if you want to write down
[18:19] or take your Bible and read with me that
[18:21] will be fine
[18:25] amen I mean it's always good if you come
[18:27] to church you come with a notebook and
[18:29] you know a pen wherever you can make
[18:31] note so do some indications in your
[18:33] Bible so that you can be able to follow
[18:35] up
[18:44] and straight away we are beginning with
[18:46] verse 22 chapter 14 of Matthew
[18:51] and straight away Jesus constrained his
[18:54] disciples to get into a ship and to go
[18:56] before him and to the other side
[18:59] while he set the multitudes away and
[19:02] when he had set the multitudes away he
[19:05] went up into a mountain apart to pray
[19:07] and when the evening was come he was
[19:10] there alone
[19:11] but the ship was now in the midst of the
[19:14] sea tossed with waves for the wind was
[19:18] contrary and in the fourth watch at the
[19:20] night Jesus went unto them walking on
[19:23] the sea and when the disciples saw him
[19:25] walking on the sea they were trouble
[19:28] saying it is a spirit and they cried out
[19:31] for fear but straight away Jesus spoken
[19:33] to them saying be of good cheer it is I
[19:36] be not afraid
[20:36] during such time times we only want to
[20:40] see demons
[20:41] [Music]
[20:44] in hard times we said a visible in
[20:48] Trials because in Affliction
[20:51] the problem is many Believers say demons
[20:54] so we see what we sing
[20:57] they expect him on Saturday they feel
[21:01] Spirits
[21:02] they do not
[21:04] feel see or even believe the presence of
[21:08] the Lord in such times
[21:21] they were they thought they were all
[21:23] alone
[21:29] and so they were alone in the world
[21:33] and it was at night
[21:36] so it was that they were all alone and
[21:41] it was uh and also the waves came at Sea
[21:45] um
[21:54] and imagine the fear they were in and it
[21:57] is
[22:04] we are strong and hungry
[22:08] and then they see someone walking on the
[22:11] water
[22:14] in that kind of atmosphere
[22:18] the only thing that the only thing they
[22:21] thought about is
[22:25] an evil spirit
[22:29] how can it be our God
[22:32] when we are suffering when we are going
[22:36] through this Affliction
[22:38] Jesus wanted them to see something
[22:45] he says it is
[22:51] how can he tell you those words when
[22:54] everything is good
[22:57] how can he speak to you such words of
[23:00] encouragement when everything is going
[23:02] around
[24:02] no one loves a hard time
[24:29] so that the Lord Can Make a known his
[24:33] attributes to us
[24:42] now there is a message in 1960 called I
[24:46] know
[24:51] and I'll take some cutting out of that
[24:55] okay and why does God let troubles come
[24:58] again
[25:02] harnesses
[25:05] he put speech in his mouth and makes it
[25:10] obey him
[25:11] soon
[26:16] foreign
[26:33] nothing can happen to you unless God
[26:36] permits it
[26:41] isn't that wonderful
[26:44] nothing can happen to a child of God by
[26:47] accident
[26:50] if something happens to you
[26:54] it means God has permitted it to happen
[27:04] Hallelujah I mean there is nothing can
[27:07] happen to your network permits it a
[27:09] white cheese
[27:11] there is no evil can come unless God
[27:14] permits it
[27:30] [Music]
[28:16] friends you have
[28:19] [Music]
[28:24] why doesn't it happen like that foreign

[31:01] oh your husband is going to be the best
[31:03] foreign
[32:03] foreign
[33:03] foreign
[34:06] and sometimes we have more troubles when
[34:09] we become a Christian than we did when
[34:11] we were Sinners
[34:21] I was asking sister
[34:23] I think I don't okay I don't remember
[34:26] the name of the sister I was asking her
[34:28] about another sister Nina system
[34:32] and I asked her where is this sister
[34:39] that sister
[34:42] she came to the message
[34:44] things became more for her
[34:50] she said I think she's in the wrong
[34:51] place foreign
[35:04] [Applause]
[35:14] I can prove that by the vibrations
[35:19] god promise to Israel
[35:22] that they will have a land to make their
[35:25] parents flowing with milk and honey
[35:32] did he promise them
[35:35] did he give it to them
[35:38] they were fighting when they were still
[35:40] in the desert
[35:43] they went through the battle with the
[35:46] the Pharaoh
[35:48] I went through the afflictions of the
[35:50] Red Sea
[35:52] they went through the suffering of the
[35:55] of the River Jordan
[35:58] but then they crossed over
[36:01] into the cannon and cannons foreign
[36:28] [Music]
[37:12] and they're fighting foreign
[37:32] don't ever think you're going to get
[37:34] those promises as I walk over for the
[37:37] words until the series again
[37:39] you are going to have to fight for every
[37:42] one of them all you know
[37:44] you are going to have to be determined
[37:47] or you know Hallelujah I mean I will not
[37:50] give up
[37:53] until the last stop of my blood pressure
[37:57] is
[37:58] going to yield myself to the Lord
[38:01] I'm going to fight for my marriage
[38:04] foreign
[38:30] Hallelujah Amina let me tell you God
[38:32] does not want weaklings
[38:35] God does not want weaklings in his
[38:38] kingdom
[38:39] God is looking for quality
[38:43] not numbers
[38:45] [Music]
[39:29] he can't manage
[39:34] the main results the guys are able that
[39:37] will drink it like dogs
[39:47] out they're looking around
[39:53] now this man did not know
[39:56] but he didn't only told them
[39:59] go and drink
[40:02] just look at this and tell you
[40:06] you stand here
[40:12] he already knew the
[40:16] tricks
[40:25] but they were ready to go through the
[40:28] Affliction
[40:31] Hallelujah I mean and prove themselves
[40:34] to be men
[40:37] are you here
[40:39] is what God is looking for
[40:43] even in USA
[40:46] foreign
[41:11] [Music]
[41:23] he himself when he was on Earth
[41:27] our Lord come off he prayed yes
[41:33] and sometimes when he was about to be uh
[41:37] crucified
[41:39] he went on the mountains
[41:44] until blood came down
[41:49] hey talk about prayer
[42:53] can you say
[43:11] your mind is filled with the world and
[43:14] the words I hate you then see you will
[43:15] let afflictions
[43:30] because now you are chasing after
[43:33] something else
[43:35] because it is written many are the
[43:37] afflictions of the righteous and but God
[43:39] delivers him from them
[43:45] God promised many afflictions
[43:53] that would be beyond our understanding
[43:58] is
[44:06] praise the name of the Lord
[44:08] you go through things
[44:11] that you can't understand why they are
[44:14] out there
[44:20] you want to say but sincerely are you
[44:24] really with me
[44:27] but it's always done for your goods
[44:34] just can't understand it
[44:36] because if we understood
[44:39] then it would not be of Faith to us
[44:44] we will go with our understanding but
[44:51] it means if we understood it we would go
[44:53] with an understanding not with faith
[45:03] but we do it and we have it and we
[45:06] believe by faith his word
[45:11] that it's going to work some good thing
[45:14] for us today
[45:24] and there is none of us immune from them
[45:31] I know
[45:32] I think those things you're talking
[45:34] about are for the poor
[45:37] me I'm okay I'm pretty established
[45:41] things
[45:46] no my friends
[45:48] there is none of us immune
[45:52] from them
[45:56] foreign
[45:57] [Music]
[46:12] yes
[46:14] Bill Gates no no no no no no okay
[46:17] there's someone here today
[46:19] and I think he either got sick or he
[46:21] died or something like that somewhere
[46:24] where he someone was writing he said he
[46:26] was in a hospital bed one way idea
[46:31] and he said
[46:35] that he could not he realized what is
[46:39] most important is life someone
[46:47] for anything
[46:52] but he could not have the ability of
[46:56] paying someone to be sick on their
[46:59] behalf
[47:00] foreign
[47:12] you can have
[47:14] the whole world and see your knowing
[47:17] you're better than you but sometimes God
[47:18] can can permit the situations to happen
[47:21] on your life so that you remember you
[47:23] are human your motto now
[47:31] no one does no one in this world
[47:35] is immune from afflictions
[47:48] you must go through afflictions
[48:00] no one is immune Teddy are garments
[48:04] there are many men of faith
[48:09] yet they were Afflicted
[48:12] there were many great Kings
[48:15] I was speaking with the brother about
[48:18] um King Nebuchadnezzar
[48:21] and the brother was telling me Oh King
[48:24] Nebuchadnezzar
[48:26] she was so great
[48:30] foreign
[49:02] foreign
[49:46] there is nothing there is no greatness
[49:48] with God
[49:51] there's only such great people that God
[49:53] has made great
[49:56] if you want to be great it's only God
[49:59] who can make you great
[50:02] you must understand
[50:13] but you will not be immune from this
[50:15] afflictions
[50:21] but God will deliver you if you are his
[50:24] child
[50:27] it is written in one of the scriptures
[50:29] in the Bible that trials are brought
[50:31] upon us are more precious to us than God
[50:35] itself
[50:45] it is God giving us this trial
[50:50] if I asked you how many here want some
[50:52] gold
[50:55] if you want some good raise
[51:04] foreign
[52:07] is to bring us to a place where God can
[52:10] make himself more real to us
[52:16] more real to us
[52:19] than he was before the trial came oh
[52:21] because
[52:24] I want to join in this morning with job
[52:27] to say that I've lived long enough to
[52:29] know that that is the truth
[52:34] [Music]
[52:37] and it says I have seen it in my own
[52:40] life

[53:30] Affliction and such trouble what will it
