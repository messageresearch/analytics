[35:33] scripture read Matthew chapter 6 verses
[35:35] 9 to 13.
[35:37] and the text was about prayer the Lord
[35:40] is prayer
[35:41] the lesson we have learned that the
[35:43] Lord's Prayer is
[35:46] a guide that Jesus gave us to teach us
[35:49] how to pray
[35:51] and when we are praying
[35:54] we should worship God first
[35:57] thank him
[35:58] and pray for our needs and also pray for
[36:01] others and should also ask God to
[36:04] forgive us
[36:05] our sins and also ask him to protect us
[36:08] from evil and you have also learned that
[36:11] prayer is the greatest weapon against
[36:13] the devil

[50:38] so I would like to uh to bring greetings

[50:48] unfortunately I thought I would show you
[50:50] a slideshow with photos and some videos
[50:54] [Music]
[51:00] but I thought it is going to be better
[51:03] to uh to do a newsletter instead
[51:09] uh
[51:10] um
[51:11] [Music]
[51:12] they will save time and it will have
[51:15] more information
[51:21] [Music]
[51:31] [Music]
[51:33] I'm trying to put together a newsletter
[51:40] and uh we shall put it up on the website
[51:43] and give you the link and PDF so you can
[51:45] be able to go through it
[51:49] again
[51:51] but for those who cannot be able to read
[51:55] and maybe those who will not access I
[51:57] just want to give you a little bit of uh
[51:59] a report of what the Lord did during the
[52:03] time when we have been away
[52:08] this was a missionary trip
[52:12] you know it was past aside who helped me
[52:14] to understand that um
[52:18] it has been a missionary
[52:20] [Music]
[52:24] when you travel as a pastor maybe you
[52:26] visit church and then minister in a
[52:28] church and then come back
[52:33] but this was a full-fledged missionary
[52:36] trip traveling to many areas many places
[52:38] at the same time
[52:41] [Music]
[52:53] I did not initially tell you that I was
[52:55] going to South Africa
[52:59] Africa because I had not yet got the
[53:02] Visa
[53:04] and it came on the very last minute
[53:09] so I traveled on 30.
[53:12] and I'm telling you friends before I
[53:15] even tell you everywhere I've been but
[53:19] I've been greatly impacted by this trip
[53:24] to especially you know commit myself to
[53:27] do more for the Lord
[53:32] I think we we all need to do more for
[53:34] the Lord
[53:39] because there are many people out there
[53:41] serving God seriously
[53:44] and we really want to also continue to
[53:48] do more even more to be more serious
[53:53] foreign
[54:14] it was a good time especially not only
[54:17] in the service but also having
[54:18] fellowship with him
[54:23] this is a man who believes the same
[54:26] thing I believe
[54:28] I love this same message the way we love
[54:31] it
[54:33] he has consecrated this his life to this
[54:36] message
[54:40] and I really appreciated to see that
[54:44] a lot of young people they are really
[54:47] serving God with all they have an engine
[54:52] I think Pastor mahede is my senior
[54:58] I really from the fellowship I had with
[55:00] him and the kind of nature of the
[55:02] ministry has
[55:06] I felt he should even come in one of our
[55:08] youth meetings I believe he'll be a
[55:10] blessing
[55:14] so then from Johannesburg we had a
[55:18] Friday and a Sunday then I traveled to a
[55:20] flight to Zimbabwe
[55:22] Johannesburg
[55:24] we had initially planned with Pastor
[55:28] said who had actually invited us there
[55:31] is
[55:36] that we were coming he also invited us
[55:38] to come and take a few meetings
[55:44] they were having Easter meetings also in
[55:48] Harare
[55:50] I'm telling you this man have really
[55:52] worked for God
[56:05] has been physically run down
[56:08] [Music]
[56:12] in the past it was it seemed to be a
[56:15] very uh growing and fast-growing country
[56:18] um
[56:22] they had the white people there and so
[56:25] they had the Farms big farms Big Time
[56:27] Farms
[56:29] big factories
[56:32] I mean people were really the economy
[56:35] was booming
[56:38] white people left
[56:40] again uh
[56:42] you know like everything started going
[56:45] down
[56:47] so you have a lot of actually young
[56:49] people migrating from Zimbabwe to South
[56:53] Africa and the UK
[56:58] African UK but in the middle of all that
[57:04] has very little population Zimbabwe is
[57:09] how many people do we have here
[57:15] yes
[57:18] 45 Millions
[57:22] you know our land mass is not that large
[57:29] 17 millions
[57:32] and its land mass is so big
[57:38] so the people are very few
[57:41] so you would say that maybe you will
[57:43] find message believing churches of about
[57:45] maybe 20 people 30 40.
[57:52] foreign
[57:53] [Music]
[58:08] [Music]
[58:20] [Music]
[58:47] and so for the for the most of the first
[58:49] week I spent it with the brethren in
[58:51] Harare
[58:56] was in um
[59:00] he left he went to Harare
[59:04] he went to the UK
[59:07] and all those places where he was
[59:11] going to see there was a lot of work
[59:14] that God did
[59:18] churches that
[59:38] which is almost 300 kilometers away
[59:44] this is a church of several hundreds
[59:48] I saw I saw on the on the cornerstone
[59:51] there was a writing that Pastor chikos
[59:53] dedicated that in 1987.
[1:00:00] a few of us were born at that time but
[1:00:03] at that time there were people preaching
[1:00:06] this message
[1:00:08] and there are very many people there who
[1:00:11] are still standing
[1:00:14] exception
[1:00:21] spent at their place at his home in a
[1:00:24] very way then we traveled back to uh to
[1:00:26] Harare
[1:00:28] and you see every place I'm telling you
[1:00:30] I was preaching please
[1:00:33] you can imagine I I was really I think I
[1:00:37] this was the time I've preached more
[1:00:39] services
[1:00:45] so then at in at Highlands this is a
[1:00:49] certain part in a Harare
[1:00:51] they had the Eastern meetings also
[1:00:56] about maybe a thousand people so a
[1:00:59] little more and and they were gathering
[1:01:00] there
[1:01:03] and we took the first day the Friday the
[1:01:07] Friday two Services
[1:01:10] I preached the first service
[1:01:13] the second service and remember on
[1:01:16] Saturday we had the main Services which
[1:01:19] was the reason why we went to Zimbabwe
[1:01:24] almost about another 300.
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:28] after preaching on Friday morning Friday
[1:01:32] afternoon
[1:01:35] immediately we went to uh to our car
[1:01:38] and we traveled to uh to to Guero
[1:01:43] and by the time we reached in Guero
[1:01:46] again I sure didn't feel like preaching
[1:01:48] I'm so tired
[1:01:51] brother are you sure I'm preaching in
[1:01:53] the morning
[1:01:56] I said ah no you are the one
[1:01:59] so I started praying for God to give me
[1:02:01] Grace
[1:02:03] God gave us wonderful meetings
[1:02:07] I am Telling You wonderful meetings
[1:02:11] there is a testimony the Pastor said to
[1:02:14] me here is that one and uh and I'll read
[1:02:19] a portion for you
[1:02:22] of that testimony
[1:02:24] there is a quote
[1:02:27] of brother Branham
[1:02:31] Lucas
[1:02:33] Samson the lion run out to kill him
[1:02:37] the lion when the power of God come upon
[1:02:40] him
[1:02:45] just probably pull his Jaws apart
[1:02:49] a little bit curly headed shrimp about
[1:02:53] that high little bitty old fellows
[1:02:55] scrolling look on the street
[1:03:00] seven little locks hanging around his
[1:03:02] head like a little
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:09] and he was no more than a little
[1:03:11] until the spirit of God come upon him um
[1:03:17] now it wouldn't be hard to believe that
[1:03:20] a great big giant could slay a lion with
[1:03:22] his hand
[1:03:24] [Music]
[1:03:27] I believe you couldn't
[1:03:29] but funny thing was this little bitty
[1:03:32] fellow done it
[1:03:35] but the spirit of the Lord come upon him
[1:03:38] um
[1:03:49] he ever eat
[1:04:05] [Music]
[1:04:12] [Music]
[1:04:15] just overcome it with the power of God
[1:04:20] Hallelujah and so friends while I was
[1:04:25] preaching in our church
[1:04:26] I should also say this the place where
[1:04:30] they were gathering
[1:04:32] they lost it
[1:04:37] you almost even canceled the meeting
[1:04:42] he failed to continue pressing forward
[1:04:44] to find another place
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:04:48] couldn't find another place so but they
[1:04:52] had they had Churchland
[1:04:55] have toilets
[1:04:59] [Music]
[1:05:01] so they couldn't be allowed to hold me
[1:05:04] to have the license to uh hold meetings
[1:05:09] but he organized and he found the
[1:05:12] neighbors they allowed them to use their
[1:05:13] presses and and so they got a place on
[1:05:16] that land and they raised the tentative
[1:05:35] [Music]
[1:05:50] [Music]
[1:05:59] right at the
[1:06:02] foreign and you know and on the last
[1:06:05] service if you these services are being
[1:06:07] streamed on our Channel but you will
[1:06:09] listen right on the pulpitas

[1:50:44] going on in his life
[1:50:48] but this is a young man born in the
[1:50:51] message

[2:05:51] the same
[2:05:55] would have been in many many different
[2:05:58] parts of life
[2:06:06] and when God gets a holiday
[2:06:09] if you were a seed of God is
[2:06:17] and soul
[2:07:10] how
[2:07:18] does it
[2:07:30] he said I went when I was joining the
[2:07:33] the work here specialist
[2:07:38] so he you know to work for for the for
[2:07:41] the State House you have to go through
[2:07:43] the drills of the Army and the police
[2:07:49] for six months my name is
[2:08:02] I became so so strong and so how
[2:08:05] strong-hearted even when the world comes
[2:08:09] it doesn't move me easily
[2:08:12] but right there now we began talking he
[2:08:16] began encouraging him we began showing
[2:08:18] him crazy
[2:08:50] [Music]
[2:09:19] nothing
[2:10:19] foreign
[2:10:24] are you hearing what I'm saying to you
[2:10:27] nothing else matters
[2:10:30] when he was baptized and he was prayed
[2:10:34] for by brothers
[2:10:35] and his eyes opened
[2:10:38] you know their eyes we are blind guy you
[2:10:42] got severe people are blind that's his
[2:10:45] message
[2:10:47] and yet they think they are singing

[2:10:52] um
[2:10:54] but when you come under the influence
[2:10:58] of the entire message
[2:11:01] what happened so
[2:11:09] they dropped now you go once like he did
[2:11:11] with him
[2:11:14] I believe is
[2:11:18] different from his second saying um
[2:11:24] foreign
[2:12:18] at first he thought it was okay to wear
[2:12:20] a a a a trousers
[2:12:32] you thought you cannot be smart
[2:12:35] and you thought you cannot look nice
[2:12:38] when you don't dress the way they dress
[2:12:41] but when the scales went off
[2:12:55] that you are fearful
[2:12:58] um
[2:13:10] you start seeing you no longer need the
[2:13:14] girlfriends
