come on that day we shall be just give it back to you through good design we ask that you come and speak to us in jesus mighty name amen amen amen we take john 20 once again i'm happy to see you all that i've made it tonight my name is i'll probably be an hour uh you have to jack matters our game [Music] i do that so that all your attention you can give it to me um right so we're reading from verse 19. then then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples where the disciples were assembled for fear of the jews came jesus and and stood in the midst and said unto them peace peace unto you foreign he showed unto them his hands and his side then where the disciples glad when they saw the lord then said jesus to them again peace be unto you as my father has sent me even so send are you oh yes and when he had said this he breathed on them and he said unto them receive ye the holy ghost uh as usual for your undivided attention so that we shall see what the lord will have for us tonight i want to know my child right now i mean i've even as if you don't have time even as you are walking on the road you can be praying so we find that here jesus he begins to speak to the disciples this was shortly after the resurrection and you know that jesus had died and everybody the pharisees thought that it is what the first adam failed to do he noticed that nothing of what he had created what was in his image the eleventh if you're never turned that the world watching which fought on each other it all came out of god beyond navigable it came out of the spoken word whereby his word can continue to create in that image an image whose word would be as good as god is hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord please you have to to do your job there amen so we notice that god after he cleared everything and now he had created man not on the moon man was in the image of god [Music] quickly go to the book of genesis look at me seeing thee okay named chavez already everyday and the bible says i believe verses 26 verse chapter one all right maybe to get a clear picture we can begin from verse 24. and god said let the earth be bring forth the living creature after his kind cattle and creeping thing and beast of the earth after his kind and it was so short and god made the beast of the earth after his kind and cattle after their kind and everything that creepeth upon the earth after thee after his kind and god saw that it was good hungarian but then he noticed that he had nothing after his kind of his foreign and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that keeps upon the earth maybe our guru so you notice church that we the human race or child anti-faith was created for what purpose agenda to have dominion [Music] or anything and he wanted to display his name in them he never let therefore let anybody rule over them but when israel came from egypt on down into the promised land very community video but literally they know by doing that they were putting themselves under subjection of man validated women but they were not supposed to be under any money's [Applause] i have to turn that to the banjo are you listening to me this evening each of you is different and each of you is special in god's sight each of you was created to have dominion identity yeah we're losing that god given power using their authority the church has repressed it with the constitution of the church of the holy principle of a man and god intent on dying to have a bride in the end he will be ruled in the same way who will be led the same if it is supposed to be used of god but he knows what can i do to help you get into your original condition that is your original image furniture which we lost at the beginning oh hallelujah these men who you see a hallelujah original [Music] that is people who are born by believers we as believers thank our kids to create an atmosphere for them create our good buttons in our homes in our churches my counsel for them to know jesus christ many parents who are believers have thought that automatically their children are believers [Music] [Music] [Applause] but the way we you meet a young child with the spirit of witchcraft hallelujah he came to god yet jericho and suggested to god everything was okay tell me a better he had sacrificed his brother on a stone yeah yet accept muganda with ginger and now he was presenting himself before no difference for my witch and all of us are born with that kind of spirit and nature upon us and that was everyone who turned the way with you but it was not supposed to be our original nature why are you not desire to overcome praise the name of the lord amen and so jesus comes here after the resurrection yes praise the name of the lord and and uh just take it one hour after that i'll just quit and continue next time amen hallelujah amen after the resurrection of jesus yes to show how important he showed the hands without i was crucified international that you may be born because remember adam was taken was taken out of the east hallelujah and jesus is [Music] who was stainless why didn't i just roll your tires and who was sick it was the king of glory god himself and my father sent me even sustained are you sure and when he had said this you breathed on them i was the first man created a genitalia wouldn't be challenging it was a mold out of the ground literally it was nothing but god lazy into this small [Music] but jesus he braved the breath of life to the disciples hallelujah amen which means you don't need to die [Music] [Music] foreign the holy spirit and i am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the egyptians and to bring them out of their land and to a good land and a large and to a land flowing with milk and honey and to the place of the canaanites and the hittites and the amorites and the parasites and the evites and the jeb sites now there are behold the cry of the children of israel has come unto me and i've also seen the oppressed oppression where will the egyptians oppress them enhances [Music] now we see that here god comes down to speak and speak he speaks to moses you realize that before the fall man was living in heaven god is intention for man and she can't do it to live in a good land that later become the jews we know as israelites are you following me and these people he wanted to call them by [Applause] the called out ones why are you called out ones like we we are called out of the denomination i mean but few amen and we see that these people who are going to this land they're not driving anybody back in a museum [Music] because they doubted it the bible says if any man asks anything of the lord let him ask without doubt god has promised to give you the holy spirit more time for you to receive the holy grail and there is nothing and i repeat that is not sin that is a child of god which god has promised them catholics but the problem once prophesied and we are doubting the promise kept on doubting their messages hallelujah amen the purpose of us having charts destruct the holy ghost the purpose of us praying jesus christ [Music] [Applause] hallelujah amen that adam lost adam to have a forward test of it when you are still living in this flesh when you receive the holy ghost you are able to go in the rapture demonstration the anger monitor of the holocaust so you see without the demonstration path there is no ghost they worry if you are sick and they pray for you and you cannot get well i wonder then there is no god in jesus why do we even need to preach if there is no divine healing what about you why do we need to believe in the gospel if there is no salvation you preach the gospel to become a little poor people in a corner that is so sorry to be christians do you think that this goes for god has given it to us so that he can make us feel bad in this world this gospel more than what [Music] [Applause] they have even taken the same things and promises of god for us but the debinations of catholicism and they have decided to copy them they have become copycats you know i i why do i say that russian you're getting away manifestation do you guess what i'm talking about don't settle for less petty god manifests himself [Music] themselves they apply to themselves [Music] [Music] is hallelujah why [Music] getting massachusetts you can bring many teachings talking about mysteries about the mystery the injury why right because the devil did not have a problem as long as that revel that revealed the mystery of yours in the future we shall go in the promised land two jackets obviously the devil says but now you are here but now you never fear satan yet yeah yes because to show you about that land is real and see your name then let's go never never to gain day that kind of gospel is not allowed to happen there's is and you [Applause] let me tell and the people who laughed and made fun and would not accept his message they perished with the rest of the unbelievers of is [Music] to [Music] this is our time in this challenge when all the promises of god one even though i can tell that you're not come to pass whether you know through killing our life hallelujah amen if in the future i'm going to speak when bangladesh did you know that the prophet preached and said what you expect is what you get [Music] but the believers went out and entered into the promised land they and the believers went out i was killed and entered into the promised land they went under the anointed message of the messenger there is no way you can enter into the promised land without the messenger's message there is no way you can receive listen listen the true genuine holy ghost without the messenger's message you know some people when we talk about the holocaust they think it's just having not when you believe see which means you don't receive the holy ghost when you believe that you receive the holy ghost the moment you have that experience with god an encounter with god that was [Music] when they what was the importance of the holy spirit they concluded let me tell you when you get the holy spirit he hinders you from doing certain things your body [Music] let me go and do this in your life that is why i must be a man who trusts in a man too that is why before a believer an unbeliever wants someone to attack killings because you will preach that word [Applause] this
