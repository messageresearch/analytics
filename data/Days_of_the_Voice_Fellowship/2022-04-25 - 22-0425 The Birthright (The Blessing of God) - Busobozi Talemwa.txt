lentils represents all the things that we think we want in this world it represents the things that you think if you don't have it you will die into the other ones you think that you need it and you need it immediately if you can't help it now because he did has done i want to read that you just be patient how many will do this is the holy spirit there is only one special group of people in this world nsc and that is the christian narrative those who have received jesus christ christ in the name of the lord jesus they are the only special categories and here we have our example and his name is now we are going to go through that scripture in the end for now i would like us to look at this bathroom when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he that he may not make the sign of the beloved first born before the son of the hatred you need to read that out of your lugana bible because that was not a correct translation i'll read verses again then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he has that he may not make the first the son of the beloved firstborn before the son of the headed which is indeed the first born read versus [Music] [Music] for the first born by giving him a double portion of all that he has for he is the beginning of his strength and the right of his and the right of the first born is his anger oh [Music] hallelujah hallelujah now i know we will go a bit slow in the beginning because i want to teach something very nice the law you know that very well is that correct she's true you know you will always have the favor right in you and the one who is not the favorite law says if the first [Music] goes to the firstborn i'm already everybody are you following me so now that was the law according to the law then you would continue to say now he would also give the firstborn a double portion of all that he has [Music] hallelujah amen praise the name of the lord come here there's a brother coming from rwanda so i need you to see if he is the one who just helped him give the directions hallelujah hallelujah church i want you to follow me he says that another portion of course everybody gets a portion his question from the father but now when it becomes the firstborn remaining instead of his father when his father is dead gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things and examination with the first cities in judah but the kingdom gave him [Applause] amen the spiritual authority amen amen you know he was the one to become the priest as we will find out later that uh roman reigns for now but let me not go ahead of myself how many are following me i know sometimes when we have to go deep and study the bible some people go off so i want to remember i'm a bible you know you see many together you are the first born into the kingdom of god by the holy spirit we are first born today now remember that we have read in revelation and zechariah must come right after the tribulation the church of the first born does not go through the tribulation there are coming times if he said that he didn't end up with when there will be a tribulation on earth and there will be a new system in the world whatever that way in korea in cameroon see there will be a new world order in pia muncie you know new world financial systems if you don't believe me well that one's the kid is don't believe what i'm telling you you always be here to say yes but it will not be a good time for you because wherever he is and if they are not doing so well they are under a cup [Music] it has happened before it is he that was he that is [Music] they will rise fast what about us hallelujah amen then we wish our life and remain here on our future but also in christ will amen why do you think we get excited when we hear the world

desire the things of the world i mean to be unseen that body is there the we shall be the that is what we call the rapture is hallelujah praise the name of the lord come here and i will see hallelujah amen but there will be one that will go through the tribulation but i'm glad i'm one of them going in the rapture i am one of them [Applause] oh they became the priests to uh to the kingdom king the physical and spiritual blessing of our fathers follows jesus christ from that my brother began the one please are we you know ethiopia we would say my sophia together okay you know they say what
