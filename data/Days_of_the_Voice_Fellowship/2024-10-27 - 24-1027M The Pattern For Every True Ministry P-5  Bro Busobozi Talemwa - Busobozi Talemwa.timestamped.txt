[1:16:33] last night last
[1:16:36] Friday and um I don't know if the sister
[1:16:39] is here but we had a very Supernatural
[1:16:42] service on
[1:16:47] Friday and if you did not if you were
[1:16:49] here and you didn't get a
[1:16:52] visitation then then you
[1:16:55] really need to have a
[1:17:01] visitation and
[1:17:04] um and so she says God bless you Pastor
[1:17:07] I wanted to follow up on the
[1:17:08] conversation
[1:17:14] yesterday I didn't share the full
[1:17:16] details of the Visions I
[1:17:22] received but I feel L to share the
[1:17:25] complete picture with you
[1:17:30] now in my
[1:17:32] vision she saw a vision here in the
[1:17:39] overnight I saw a newly built
[1:17:45] church
[1:17:48] amen well she saw the vision here I
[1:17:51] believe God is speaking about this
[1:17:52] church
[1:17:57] and but that's not
[1:17:58] all with a
[1:18:00] river flowing through
[1:18:05] it initially the there was that there
[1:18:10] was that water initially the water was
[1:18:14] dirty and stained with
[1:18:17] dir however in the next part of the
[1:18:22] vision the water transformed
[1:18:26] into Clean and Clear
[1:18:33] Water finally I saw the river
[1:18:38] overflowing how I ready for
[1:18:40] this I saw the river
[1:18:43] overflowing with
[1:18:49] [Applause]
[1:18:50] dollars if you receive it social it to
[1:18:53] you
[1:18:58] we don't we have not only received the
[1:19:00] word we've not only received the
[1:19:04] word the word comes with
[1:19:09] extra I saw it's not my message it's the
[1:19:11] message from the Lord
[1:19:14] s she's saw she's also saying what she
[1:19:18] saw I saw the river overflowing with
[1:19:23] dollars presenting an abundance of
[1:19:26] financial
[1:19:31] blessings and I've said it here many
[1:19:33] times that I see many are going to be
[1:19:39] millionaires but those are the ones who
[1:19:42] are committed to the work of
[1:19:45] God who are giving the to the work of
[1:19:49] God especially the land fund and all
[1:19:51] that and you has been giving
[1:19:55] God has showed us our church is going to
[1:19:57] be
[1:19:59] built we are not only going to buy land
[1:20:02] but our church is going to be
[1:20:05] built praise the name of the
[1:20:08] Lord and then she says she failed to
[1:20:10] share the vision with me entire in its

[1:25:59] time feel happy feel
[1:26:01] relaxed there just a few of us not here
[1:26:04] this
[1:26:06] morning but I think I know of Sister
[1:26:08] Rose who is in
[1:26:11] Tanzania and the others perhaps are
[1:26:13] streaming with
[1:26:15] us God bless you all we certainly want
[1:26:19] to welcome
[1:26:20] you
[1:26:22] amen hallelujah
[1:26:26] Hallelujah I have a a subject this
[1:26:30] morning that I'd like to share with
[1:26:35] you I preached on this um
[1:26:39] before on Sunday is just a continuation
[1:26:42] of of Sunday
[1:26:46] service we I was speaking on the pattern
[1:26:50] for every true Ministry
[1:26:56] so how many I enjoying that
[1:26:58] subject amen and um I always want to
[1:27:02] finish it with it and then I feel God
[1:27:03] has
[1:27:06] more last night last night um I I
[1:27:10] struggled and I couldn't get what to
[1:27:12] talk
[1:27:14] about not that I didn't have things to
[1:27:16] talk
[1:27:18] about but I always want to hear the
[1:27:21] voice of God for the service for every
[1:27:23] particular
[1:27:28] so I got frustrated and I I said to
[1:27:31] myself let me go
[1:27:33] sleep sometimes I don't even sleep up to
[1:27:35] what whatever
[1:27:37] time so when I went to
[1:27:40] bed and you know um I I was still
[1:27:45] meditating about the service and what
[1:27:47] the Lord wanted me to speak
[1:27:50] about and uh um then there it
[1:27:55] came and I
[1:27:58] shouted
[1:27:59] [Music]
[1:28:00] Hallelujah afterwards I felt so sorry
[1:28:02] for my
[1:28:04] wife said what is
[1:28:06] happening I said as as it come well
[1:28:11] she's used to me whenever inspiration
[1:28:14] comes I just shout and
[1:28:16] eny and so because it is something from
[1:28:19] the supernatural
[1:28:21] world and so this morning I can confirm
[1:28:24] to you that the Lord wants me to
[1:28:25] continue this
[1:28:28] subject and um some different directions
[1:28:32] that you shall
[1:28:35] take but uh on the same subject because
[1:28:38] I've been talking on the pattern about
[1:28:40] the pattern for every true
[1:28:45] Ministry and but I I I've taken
[1:28:49] different directions to it
[1:28:54] one of the days I talked about um the
[1:28:57] false
[1:28:59] Ministries the false
[1:29:02] prophets uh but Anointed with the right
[1:29:07] Spirit but having the wrong
[1:29:09] Doctrine so we talked about that and we
[1:29:13] saw really I think on Sunday did we talk
[1:29:15] about that on
[1:29:16] Sunday and then on on on on on
[1:29:20] Wednesday we also spoke on the same
[1:29:23] subject
[1:29:25] but speaking on the true
[1:29:29] Ministry so today in a way I want us to
[1:29:31] continue with
[1:29:35] that sometimes I think they are more
[1:29:37] here they are more online than than is
[1:29:43] here sometimes we hear from them from
[1:29:45] other countries all over the
[1:29:48] world from
[1:29:51] Europe from America sometimes
[1:29:55] Ethiopia I know there is a Saints who do
[1:29:58] not have a fellowship in the north part
[1:30:00] of of the
[1:30:03] country that follow the ministry
[1:30:07] here and this morning I was informed by
[1:30:10] a brother from West
[1:30:13] n uh Brother s success I think his name
[1:30:17] is he said he was gathering a few of his
[1:30:21] friends and they will be following the
[1:30:23] service this
[1:30:25] morning and so I pray that the Lord will
[1:30:28] use
[1:30:29] us to be a blessing to his bride this
[1:30:33] morning
[1:30:35] amen so the pattern for every true
[1:30:41] Ministry now in second Peter chapter 1
[1:30:44] verse
[1:30:47] 10 it says where for the rather Brethren
[1:30:50] give diligence to make your calling and
[1:30:52] election sure
[1:31:23] sure I'm not sure what exactly you
[1:31:26] reading you in that is
[1:31:32] Timo so I want you to go to
[1:31:37] Peter excuse him sometimes those things
[1:31:40] happen
[1:32:08] um how many are glad to be message
[1:32:13] Believers we are glad to believe the
[1:32:15] message
[1:32:17] of and so this morning I want us to once
[1:32:21] again go through these things
[1:32:24] and try to
[1:32:27] establish how we can be able to um find
[1:32:32] a true
[1:32:35] Ministry it used to be that we
[1:32:39] thought only it is the message versus
[1:32:42] the
[1:32:45] denominations but it is no more that
[1:32:48] way even among those who claim to
[1:32:51] believe the message
[1:32:55] there's a lot of messes here and
[1:32:57] there and so we want to be
[1:33:00] sure we are under a right
[1:33:05] Ministry We are following the right
[1:33:08] Ministry because if you are under a
[1:33:10] wrong
[1:33:12] Ministry then you are blind and you
[1:33:16] being led by the
[1:33:17] Blind and Jesus said if the blind lead
[1:33:21] the blind
[1:33:24] they the one who is being led goes to
[1:33:26] heaven but the other one falls into the
[1:33:28] ditch
[1:33:33] right are you following me he says both
[1:33:36] of them fall into the
[1:33:42] ditch so you see many times when a a
[1:33:47] person receives the receive the
[1:33:49] truth they did not want to leave their
[1:33:52] denomination
[1:33:55] and the reason is they always thought
[1:33:58] that they would change their
[1:34:01] denomination so you find that a man like
[1:34:03] we shall see later on called Martin
[1:34:08] Luther he was a Roman Catholic
[1:34:12] priest he did not think that the
[1:34:15] Catholic church can completely go
[1:34:20] astray he thought the doctrines were
[1:34:23] wrong
[1:34:25] but he he had an
[1:34:28] idea that he can be able to reform that
[1:34:31] same
[1:34:33] church and remain as a part of
[1:34:37] it but you see later on he
[1:34:40] realize it is not
[1:34:42] possible to reform a dead
[1:34:45] body you can only come out of
[1:34:49] it you know Jesus said come out of the
[1:34:51] of all my people
[1:34:54] be not partakers of a
[1:34:56] sin so that is why it is very
[1:34:59] important for you to know who is leading
[1:35:03] you to know even in the message
[1:35:07] churches which Ministry are you
[1:35:10] sitting what does your pastor
[1:35:13] preach what does he
[1:35:15] believe because you see what I believe
[1:35:19] is what I impress on
[1:35:21] you what the speed behind me is what
[1:35:26] comes on you if you find the pastor is
[1:35:30] immoral even if he believes the
[1:35:34] truth and he begins to preach those
[1:35:37] immoral spirits will come on the
[1:35:40] people and you find the same spirit is
[1:35:42] going around the
[1:35:44] congregation if a pastor is a man with
[1:35:48] short
[1:35:49] temper you find the same thing happens
[1:35:53] to the
[1:35:54] congregation you find the people have
[1:35:57] temp why and then all of a sudden you
[1:36:00] find their leader is the same way so if
[1:36:04] your pastor that believes that days of
[1:36:07] the Miracles are
[1:36:09] passed you will also find you don't
[1:36:12] believe in
[1:36:14] miracles and that's why we left
[1:36:18] denominations because our leaders did
[1:36:20] not believe the full councel of the
[1:36:22] world
[1:36:25] and we are not in the
[1:36:27] message to make another
[1:36:30] denomination we are in the message Amen
[1:36:33] to follow the right truth the right
[1:36:38] word and the right
[1:36:40] word must produce the right
[1:36:45] results hallelujah amen and and how can
[1:36:49] we know the right
[1:36:52] Ministry you see can only know by
[1:36:55] following the trend the
[1:36:59] pattern that has been set
[1:37:02] before so we should and and so I have a
[1:37:07] few
[1:37:08] pictures that I first of all want to
[1:37:10] share with
[1:37:11] you so you can be able to see how the
[1:37:14] Gentile church has been formed first we
[1:37:16] are going to look at it in the
[1:37:18] perspective of the generation of the age
[1:37:26] and so if you look at I know I have been
[1:37:29] referring to this but never reading it
[1:37:31] but today I want to take a a little time
[1:37:33] and read
[1:37:36] it go to the Book of Revelation as
[1:37:38] brothers you prepared in the pictures
[1:37:40] online and
[1:37:43] here um a
[1:37:47] Revelation chapter
[1:37:49] one everyone
[1:37:51] there if you there say Amen
[1:37:58] uh vers
[1:38:04] 9 there there's a lot we can read from
[1:38:06] right from verse one but
[1:38:08] um in the interest of time let us read
[1:38:11] from verse
[1:38:12] 9 I John who also am your brother and
[1:38:15] companion in Tribulation and in the
[1:38:17] Kingdom of and patience of Jesus Christ
[1:38:20] was in the aisle that is called partimos
[1:38:21] for the word of God and for the testim
[1:38:23] of Jesus
[1:38:28] [Music]
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:39] Christ don't forget that John was cast
[1:38:42] to the aisle of pmos as an an an
[1:38:50] outcast it was a sentence
[1:38:55] is the I think the only
[1:38:58] one of the Disciples of Jesus that died
[1:39:02] a natural
[1:39:03] death all the others were killed but
[1:39:08] this one they could not kill
[1:39:11] him and so one time they put him in
[1:39:15] oil in a drum full of
[1:39:18] oil you know because of what he
[1:39:21] believed brother you must be ready to
[1:39:24] die for what you
[1:39:26] believe you must not let the devil rob
[1:39:29] you from what you have
[1:39:33] received what we have received is
[1:39:35] nonnegotiable
[1:39:37] this message is not
[1:39:40] NE we cannot accept anyone to formulate
[1:39:43] it into a
[1:39:47] denomination neither can we accept to
[1:39:49] submit to man inside of the world
[1:39:54] this message is much bigger than a
[1:39:56] man this message is
[1:39:59] Christ it is God revealing himself in
[1:40:01] our
[1:40:03] generation and so John they couldn't
[1:40:05] kill
[1:40:06] him there's no one that can kill that
[1:40:08] God out of
[1:40:11] you and so they they boiled him in
[1:40:15] oil and the man could not
[1:40:18] burn the man in the morning they found
[1:40:21] he was just there dancing
[1:40:24] I'm rejoicing night and day as I W
[1:40:27] [Applause]
[1:40:30] Up ab Hallelujah he abides with me I'm
[1:40:36] rejoicing night
[1:40:40] and this man is rejoicing in the
[1:40:43] O the same God of the three Hebrew
[1:40:46] children is the same God of John the
[1:40:50] same God of John is our God today
[1:40:54] as long as we believe the same
[1:40:57] word that they believe is a miracle
[1:41:01] working
[1:41:03] God amen amen the devil will do a lot of
[1:41:07] things to try and kill that life of the
[1:41:10] word in
[1:41:12] us but he
[1:41:14] cannot he cannot because Jesus said amen
[1:41:19] that all the gates of hell
[1:41:23] shall not Prevail against the
[1:41:27] church what does it mean it means all
[1:41:31] the gates of
[1:41:33] hell will be against the
[1:41:36] church who is the church I am the church
[1:41:40] you are the church the devil will try he
[1:41:44] will bring sin and if you overcome sin
[1:41:48] he will bring other Temptations If you
[1:41:50] overcome them he will try to kill
[1:41:54] if he doesn't kill you he will try to
[1:41:56] make you
[1:41:58] Mone and when you are poor you will feel
[1:42:02] desperate and he will try to bring you
[1:42:05] depression but when that doesn't work he
[1:42:09] will try all he
[1:42:10] can if you are married he will bring
[1:42:13] issues in your
[1:42:14] marriage you know he will try whatever
[1:42:17] he can but we have the
[1:42:21] word all hell
[1:42:23] shall not
[1:42:25] Prevail why because we are the church
[1:42:30] triumphant we are made in such a way
[1:42:34] that we shall always
[1:42:38] overcome hallelujah amen the devil
[1:42:41] cannot do that anything with that
[1:42:45] one amen I'm so they tried to burn John
[1:42:49] but they couldn't burn John and they say
[1:42:52] this man now
[1:42:54] he's a witch you know when a witch tries
[1:42:58] to be witht you and Witchcraft can't cat
[1:43:02] you they call you a
[1:43:06] witch they called joh a witch they said
[1:43:10] this man is a witch oil can't kill him
[1:43:14] they do not know the God in us is
[1:43:18] stronger than all
[1:43:20] witchcraft by the way believers
[1:43:23] never fear
[1:43:26] witchcraft does witchcraft have
[1:43:29] power oh yes it does but we have a
[1:43:33] power greater than the power
[1:43:36] of we have a power we have a God we have
[1:43:41] a spirit that is dwelling within us it
[1:43:45] is the power that is greater than all
[1:43:50] witchcraft that have for never bow down
[1:43:52] to witchcraft
[1:43:54] stop singing the song of
[1:43:56] Witchcraft go beyond it and realize the
[1:44:00] power of God
[1:44:03] you and so we see here that John was
[1:44:09] banished and they sent him to the aisle
[1:44:11] of
[1:44:13] pmos Hallelujah and when he reached
[1:44:17] pmos because they knew now this man will
[1:44:20] die pimos is a very bad
[1:44:25] place where there were
[1:44:28] scorpions snakes poisonous snakes
[1:44:32] poisonous
[1:44:33] rats and everything you can think
[1:44:36] of and you know anything that goes there
[1:44:40] dies anything but John was not
[1:44:45] anything the devil knows anyone that
[1:44:48] comes in
[1:44:50] his in his um Garden
[1:44:54] Saturn is
[1:44:56] Aiden dies but I am not
[1:44:59] anything I am here in s
[1:45:02] aen to win to
[1:45:06] overcome amen I believe that for me and
[1:45:10] for you if you
[1:45:13] believe and so John when he reached the
[1:45:16] a of
[1:45:17] pus you know they thought he would die
[1:45:21] but what is John's testimony
[1:45:24] John says I John who also am your
[1:45:30] brother and companion in
[1:45:34] Tribulation don't worry if you have
[1:45:36] tribulations in your
[1:45:38] life John is your
[1:45:41] companion but John
[1:45:43] overcame you will
[1:45:46] overcome
[1:45:47] Hallelujah he says I was on the aisle of
[1:45:51] partimos
[1:45:53] for what for suffering for dying for
[1:45:59] punishment for
[1:46:01] depression I was on the a
[1:46:03] ofus for the word of
[1:46:06] God and for the testimony of Jesus
[1:46:11] Christ the devil sees
[1:46:14] suffering John sees the word of
[1:46:18] God the devil sees

[1:47:45] revelation of the word of your and the
[1:47:48] ministry with which under which you are
[1:47:51] sitting then you will not fear because
[1:47:54] you know this ministry of the word of
[1:47:58] the
[1:47:58] hour is one that is sure to take people
[1:48:02] to
[1:48:06] Heaven it is not just
[1:48:09] information some people thought that
[1:48:11] this message is just
[1:48:14] information I wish I had time listen is
[1:48:17] more than
[1:48:18] information it is the power behind the
[1:48:21] word
[1:48:23] okay let's continue first of
[1:48:25] all saying I am Alpha and
[1:48:28] Omega I was in the spirit of the Lord
[1:48:30] this
[1:48:32] day and I had behind me a great
[1:48:35] voice as of a
[1:48:37] trumpet I was in the spirit
[1:48:40] when on the Lord's
[1:48:43] day they say the Lord's day is
[1:48:46] what
[1:48:48] Sabbath
[1:48:49] Saturday that's what they say John says
[1:48:54] he was in the spirit on the Lord's day
[1:48:57] and everything written in the Book of
[1:49:00] Revelation John saw it on the Lord's
[1:49:03] Day do you know how long these
[1:49:05] Revelations
[1:49:07] took how many
[1:49:11] years two to three years I think
[1:49:13] something like that several years so the
[1:49:17] question is the Lord is day is how
[1:49:20] long I thought it 24 hours
[1:49:24] no John is trying to show us something
[1:49:27] the Lord is day is not
[1:49:29] Saturday
[1:49:31] anymore after the resurrection of Jesus
[1:49:34] Christ the lord is day is the
[1:49:38] spirit when you are in the
[1:49:42] spirit you are in the Lord's
[1:49:44] Day the Lord's day is the holy
[1:49:47] spirit that's why every believer must
[1:49:49] receive the holy
[1:49:51] spirit because when you receive the Holy
[1:49:53] Spirit you are in the Lord this
[1:49:56] day 365 days of your of your of
[1:50:02] your you are in the Lord this day every
[1:50:06] day of your life you are in the Lord
[1:50:08] this day even today for me it is the
[1:50:11] Lord's day just be in the spirit and you
[1:50:15] will walk in the Lord's day and when you
[1:50:17] get into the Lord is day you will see
[1:50:20] Visions you will see dreams dreams you
[1:50:23] will see hear prophecies and tell
[1:50:26] prophecies and see T hear T
[1:50:28] interpretation and oh I love the Lord is
[1:50:31] day there is
[1:50:33] Supernatural in the Lord is
[1:50:37] day I know some didn't get it but maybe
[1:50:39] the
[1:50:41] future we will get to explain it more
[1:50:44] praise the name of the Lord saying I am
[1:50:47] Alpha and
[1:50:49] Omega that's the voice of the trumpet
[1:50:53] I am the first and the
[1:50:55] last what you see write in a book and
[1:51:00] send it unto the seven
[1:51:02] churches which are in
[1:51:04] Asia andto
[1:51:06] Ephesus
[1:51:16] andto and I turn to see the
[1:51:19] voice that spake with
[1:51:21] me Hallelujah can I have the first
[1:51:25] slide amen I turn to see the voice that
[1:51:28] SP with
[1:51:30] me and I wanted to hear what John
[1:51:34] says and in the midst um and being
[1:51:37] turned I saw seven golden
[1:51:41] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[1:51:43] seven
[1:51:45] candlesticks I saw one like the son of
[1:51:49] man Clos with a garment down to the food
[1:51:54] and got about the PS with a golden
[1:51:58] G his head and his hair were white like
[1:52:03] wool as white as snow and his eyes were
[1:52:07] as a flame of
[1:52:08] fire praise the name of the
[1:52:11] Lord and he had in his right hand verse
[1:52:13] 16 Seven
[1:52:17] Stars and out of his mouth went a sharp
[1:52:20] two EDG the sword
[1:52:23] and his
[1:52:24] countenance was the was the sun was as
[1:52:28] the sun shinest in his
[1:52:32] strength listen to verse 17 and when I
[1:52:35] saw him I fell at his feet as
[1:52:39] dead and he laid his right uh hand upon
[1:52:43] me saying unto me fear
[1:52:47] not I am the
[1:52:49] first and the last I am he that liveth
[1:52:54] and was dead behold I am alive forever
[1:52:59] more amen and I have the keys of hell
[1:53:04] and of death I believe that Jesus is
[1:53:07] telling us this morning the same
[1:53:09] words because his word Never
[1:53:11] Dies so no matter what you are going
[1:53:14] through fear
[1:53:16] not fear not and he told him write the
[1:53:20] things which thou Hast seen and the
[1:53:22] things which are and the things which
[1:53:25] shall be here after did you see that the
[1:53:29] things right the things which you have
[1:53:31] seen the things which are and the things
[1:53:35] which shall be
[1:53:36] Hereafter so whatever John is going to
[1:53:39] speak
[1:53:40] about is for the
[1:53:43] future that is how we know that these
[1:53:45] churches of future generations of the
[1:53:48] gentle Church
[1:53:55] vers 20 The Mystery of the Seven
[1:53:59] Stars which thou sest in thy right hand
[1:54:03] and the Seven golden
[1:54:05] candlesticks the Seven
[1:54:07] Stars the
[1:54:10] angels of the seven
[1:54:13] churches everybody say
[1:54:16] angels of the seven
[1:54:19] churches the seven it says and the seven
[1:54:24] candlesticks which thou
[1:54:26] sest at the
[1:54:28] seven
[1:54:31] churches can I have the first slide
[1:54:34] now praise the name of the Lord and so
[1:54:38] he speaks about the seven
[1:54:41] churches and he says these are seven
[1:54:46] churches because they were represented
[1:54:48] by
[1:54:50] candlesticks one called Ephesus
[1:54:53] another one
[1:54:59] another and he said these are the things
[1:55:03] to
[1:55:05] come the angel told him these are the
[1:55:08] things to
[1:55:09] come but remember every
[1:55:13] church had an
[1:55:15] angel because there are seven
[1:55:18] stars are you following me and every
[1:55:22] child
[1:55:23] had a
[1:55:24] star all right and every Star was the
[1:55:29] angel of that
[1:55:31] church so we have seven GLE
[1:55:36] churches and remember this is the same
[1:55:38] Church of
[1:55:41] Jesus but we are talking about
[1:55:43] Generations or periods of
[1:55:46] time from from the
[1:55:49] first to the last and I will show you
[1:55:53] here in
[1:55:54] perspective so now we see that each
[1:55:58] church had a
[1:56:00] star tell your neighbor each church had
[1:56:03] a
[1:56:04] star each church had a
[1:56:06] star and the people of that
[1:56:10] church it was a m for them to follow
[1:56:14] that
[1:56:17] star because that
[1:56:19] star was in the hands of Jesus
[1:56:25] the star did not have its own
[1:56:29] light but it was shining the light of
[1:56:32] the
[1:56:35] sun the Sun s o
[1:56:43] n how many I enjoying this and so in
[1:56:47] every
[1:56:48] age we have that star
[1:56:52] but many churches don't know the star of
[1:56:55] their
[1:56:57] generation but I'm so glad this morning
[1:57:01] we know the star of Our
[1:57:04] Generation we know where we are
[1:57:07] standing we are more than a
[1:57:10] church we are more than a group of
[1:57:12] people who are following some organized
[1:57:16] writings we are a people that have a
[1:57:20] star Angel message
[1:57:26] Hallelujah give me the next slide and so
[1:57:30] we see here on this next
[1:57:33] slide you know a period here when the
[1:57:37] Holy Ghost came the Holy Ghost
[1:57:40] baptism you know and the people were
[1:57:43] filled with Holy
[1:57:45] Ghost and this was after Jesus
[1:57:49] Christ had already gone but I want to
[1:57:53] remember that the Jews had a
[1:57:56] time which we talked about here a
[1:58:03] timeline called the um uh the uh uh the
[1:58:10] 7even weeks of
[1:58:14] Daniel because Daniel saw this in a
[1:58:17] vision God by the ministration of an
[1:58:20] Angel
[1:58:23] Angel
[1:58:24] Gabriel God told
[1:58:27] um who is this man
[1:58:30] Daniel through Angel
[1:58:32] Gabriel the
[1:58:34] times that his
[1:58:36] people who are his
[1:58:39] people the
[1:58:42] Jews The Times They were going to
[1:58:46] have until the
[1:58:50] end the times we going to
[1:58:53] have until the
[1:58:57] Millennium the angel Minister those
[1:59:01] things to the Prophet Daniel and Daniel
[1:59:07] said it is 70
[1:59:09] weeks that God had revealed to him
[1:59:12] through Angel Gabriel and we know these
[1:59:15] are weeks of
[1:59:17] years so 49 something years
[1:59:22] but we understand the last
[1:59:25] week because you know the Messiah was
[1:59:27] cut
[1:59:29] off are you following
[1:59:31] me I want to bring it as simple as it
[1:59:34] can
[1:59:35] be the Messiah was cut
[1:59:38] off right in the middle of the last
[1:59:43] week who is the
[1:59:46] Messiah Jesus but when the Messiah was C
[1:59:52] at that
[1:59:53] time the time of the Jews was
[1:59:58] paed when was the
[2:00:01] Messiah that is when
[2:00:04] Jesus was
[2:00:06] killed by the
[2:00:09] Jews you remember when they said let his
[2:00:11] blood be upon us and our
[2:00:15] children he is there in the in the
[2:00:18] gospels and they took him on the cross
[2:00:22] and he died because the Jews gave him up
[2:00:26] they rejected him and they cut him off
[2:00:29] and from that time God was no longer now
[2:00:33] God stopped working with the
[2:00:36] Jews when you reject
[2:00:39] Jesus he stops working with
[2:00:42] you he's a
[2:00:44] gentleman and Jesus is the
[2:00:47] word when you when you close the word
[2:00:50] outside
[2:00:52] God sees to work with you and that's
[2:00:55] what the denominations have done over
[2:00:56] the
[2:00:58] years they Clos the word
[2:01:01] outside and so when Jesus
[2:01:05] died you know how long was his
[2:01:08] ministry his ministry actually started
[2:01:11] this the last
[2:01:14] week because he was Min and he
[2:01:17] ministered for three years and a
[2:01:19] half so for three years and a half
[2:01:23] Jesus was ministering physically on
[2:01:27] Earth are you following me and his
[2:01:32] ministry covered the first
[2:01:36] half of the last
[2:01:38] week of the
[2:01:41] Jews so how long then are the Jews
[2:01:45] remaining for God to work with
[2:01:48] them three years and a half
[2:01:53] if you're following me say
[2:01:55] Amen now we see that when the Messiah
[2:01:59] was
[2:02:00] C according you go in your own free time
[2:02:03] and read Romans
[2:02:06] 11 according to Romans
[2:02:09] 11 he shows us the dispensation of the
[2:02:12] Jews and the
[2:02:14] [Music]
[2:02:16] Gentiles and he says that you know the
[2:02:21] the Jews
[2:02:22] were the original
[2:02:26] branch which was of course connected to
[2:02:28] Christ the
[2:02:31] word cuz he is the
[2:02:33] vine and they were the original
[2:02:37] branches but when they unbelieved or
[2:02:41] they rejected
[2:02:43] him they were cut off and then Jesus
[2:02:48] hallelujah amen he went in the forest
[2:02:53] hallelujah amen glory hallelujah
[2:02:56] hallelujah amen he went in the forest
[2:03:00] and he found another
[2:03:02] tree and he cut off that
[2:03:05] branch and he brought it and he grafted
[2:03:09] it where the original Branch
[2:03:13] was hallelujah amen and and the Bible
[2:03:17] now
[2:03:18] says who are the wild
[2:03:23] brch you and
[2:03:25] I the Gentile
[2:03:28] church we are the wild
[2:03:31] Branch we have been grafted
[2:03:35] on but in Romans 11 it says don't
[2:03:39] boast don't boast you do not own the
[2:03:45] tree but you are owned by
[2:03:48] [Music]
[2:03:50] it it is the one holding
[2:03:52] you the life you have is not your own it
[2:03:57] is from the tree coming from the roots
[2:04:01] the life we live is not our own it's the
[2:04:05] life of
[2:04:07] Jesus it is not a denominational Church
[2:04:13] life it is not a the a theological kind
[2:04:16] of
[2:04:17] life it is a life of the word
[2:04:22] the life of Jesus Christ and he said if
[2:04:26] the original
[2:04:28] Branch could not be
[2:04:32] spared because of
[2:04:34] unbelief how much more are
[2:04:36] you who are wild by
[2:04:40] Nature you will be cut off without even
[2:04:44] a
[2:04:46] thought but he says don't worry it is
[2:04:52] when until the
[2:04:56] fullness of the
[2:05:00] Gentiles has come
[2:05:02] in what is the fullness of the
[2:05:06] Gentiles the fullness of the
[2:05:09] Gentiles is the seven Church
[2:05:13] [Music]
[2:05:15] ages tell tell your neighbor the
[2:05:17] fullness of the Gentiles is the seven
[2:05:19] Church ages
[2:05:25] so now
[2:05:26] Israel has nothing to do with the church
[2:05:32] ages the church ages are for the gentle
[2:05:38] church but you see right from the
[2:05:41] day the Holy Ghost came
[2:05:44] down then the first day
[2:05:48] counted for the for the first church age
[2:05:54] Hallelujah and who was the
[2:05:57] angel of the first church
[2:06:00] age it was
[2:06:02] Paul hey are you getting it and from
[2:06:07] this we are now going to see the
[2:06:11] pattern of every true
[2:06:16] Ministry from among the
[2:06:18] Gentiles it all began with Paul
[2:06:24] that is how we are able to know the True
[2:06:27] Church the true Ministry the true
[2:06:30] faith and we see after the church
[2:06:36] ages then comes the
[2:06:39] Rapture the Rapture of the
[2:06:43] church we are going to be C
[2:06:46] up tell your neighbor I am going to be

[2:10:12] [Music]
[2:10:14] Rapture it is just for our
[2:10:20] knowledge but but what you need is
[2:10:23] before the
[2:10:25] Rapture so we'll talk about
[2:10:28] tribulation it's for our knowledge
[2:10:31] just because the rapt has already
[2:10:34] happened so we preach
[2:10:37] tribulation just in case some people
[2:10:40] don't make
[2:10:41] it they will know what to
[2:10:45] expect some people they don't want to

[2:11:30] Gentiles that's when the two
[2:11:33] prophets Elijah and
[2:11:36] Moses will go to the
[2:11:39] Jews and those Jews will receive their

[2:11:48] Ghost they shall receive
[2:11:52] hallelujah amen they will prepare the
[2:11:54] 144,000 elect
[2:12:01] juice and so we see many things will
[2:12:04] happen after
[2:12:06] that I say I don't want to waste time
[2:12:08] with
[2:12:09] that we shall be
[2:12:11] there and you will know where you
[2:12:15] belong and during that time the bride
[2:12:18] will be there in heaven and after
[2:12:21] all the tribulation and the third world
[2:12:24] war which is
[2:12:27] amagon you are seeing what is happening
[2:12:29] in Iraq in America isra
[2:12:33] Iran these things there's something
[2:12:37] cooking you see they say now you should
[2:12:40] not escalate don't
[2:12:43] escalate because they have all
[2:12:45] fearing the third world they know what
[2:12:49] kind it will be
[2:12:51] nuclear
[2:12:52] war they even telling
[2:12:55] Iran don't don't make nuclear war
[2:12:58] nuclear
[2:13:00] weapons don't don't don't because they
[2:13:03] fear because this one is like a
[2:13:05] terrorist
[2:13:08] State because they they just you know
[2:13:12] they want to unhate or remove the
[2:13:16] Jews and and so they want they want to
[2:13:18] be ruled by sh is it called
[2:13:24] whatever and so the the regime in
[2:13:29] Iran is not after
[2:13:33] democracy and so America is feared for
[2:13:37] Iran to possess a nuclear
[2:13:40] weapon and and Israel is also
[2:13:43] fear if Iran possesses a nuclear
[2:13:47] weapon we are gone they will wipe us but
[2:13:51] you see there's something I want you to
[2:13:54] understand America is on the side of
[2:13:58] Israel and will always
[2:14:00] be but you see America is the greatest
[2:14:04] superpower militar mil
[2:14:07] [Music]
[2:14:10] speaking but Russia is not on the side
[2:14:12] of
[2:14:13] America Russia is also great
[2:14:17] superow so I want you to now see the
[2:14:20] world
[2:14:23] geopolitics and we see that you know
[2:14:25] America is trying to you know normalize
[2:14:28] Israel with nations of the
[2:14:31] world but you see somehow there others
[2:14:33] who hate
[2:14:35] Israel the only reason is Israel should
[2:14:38] not
[2:14:40] exist they want to wipe
[2:14:42] Israel out of the map they want to kill
[2:14:46] everybody there that's why on October
[2:14:49] 7th you know they just you know weapons
[2:14:52] they just
[2:14:53] shoot from
[2:14:56] Hamas you know from Gaza they just shoot
[2:14:59] all
[2:15:01] those bombs or whatever it is on
[2:15:05] Israel they want everybody to
[2:15:07] die you saw what Iran also did they sent
[2:15:12] nuclear not nuclear but Cruise
[2:15:17] missil they went in just a few minutes
[2:15:20] you know Israel has what you call um I
[2:15:23] do not know how they call it Iron Iron
[2:15:25] Dome I
[2:15:28] think and so when the when misiles
[2:15:31] come it it
[2:15:34] shoots and then they hit those misiles
[2:15:36] in the
[2:15:40] sky but this time around when Iran shoot
[2:15:46] them many of themed
[2:15:51] they
[2:15:52] landed and now that infiltrated
[2:15:56] Israel said we're going to
[2:15:58] bomb them were going to show them fire
[2:16:02] now everybody was waiting what are they
[2:16:05] going to do because see what they were
[2:16:07] going to do don't think I'm telling you
[2:16:10] military
[2:16:12] science this is the
[2:16:18] Bible I'm in the Bible
[2:16:24] now if we want to know our timeline we
[2:16:26] need to look at
[2:16:28] Israel need to know
[2:16:30] this you know timeline so we see you
[2:16:34] know Israel now with a lot
[2:16:37] ofer they wanted to bom IR if they had
[2:16:42] done that Iran would also with all
[2:16:46] their come and
[2:16:48] B and maybe
[2:16:52] how dare you do that I'm going to show
[2:16:55] you fire and Russia was going to come
[2:16:58] China was going to come
[2:16:59] up and they begin to allow to do the
[2:17:03] alliances like it was in the first world
[2:17:05] war and in the second world war and it
[2:17:08] will become a World
[2:17:10] War World
[2:17:12] War that is what is going to
[2:17:15] come but what happened that's why you
[2:17:18] were seeing you know the leaders of
[2:17:21] America flying into Israel you know
[2:17:24] please please don't don't don't
[2:17:28] escalate don't bomb their nuclear
[2:17:32] energy don't also bomb you know their
[2:17:36] oil please please please please and then
[2:17:40] they okay so they also say if you bomb
[2:17:43] them we shall not defend you so they say
[2:17:46] okay so they bombed them but they bombed
[2:17:49] only the military
[2:17:53] factories and the other ones were angry
[2:17:56] but not as angry as they would have
[2:17:59] been and at the same time America is
[2:18:02] telling Israel is telling Iran okay
[2:18:05] don't
[2:18:06] rate if you detate we will show you fire
[2:18:10] so in other words they're trying to calm
[2:18:13] everybody but let me tell you there is a
[2:18:16] war
[2:18:18] raging time is coming and
[2:18:21] when they will not calm
[2:18:25] down when they will have to
[2:18:28] fight but that war the moment America
[2:18:32] comes Russia comes Europe comes it's a
[2:18:36] nuclear
[2:18:38] war it will finish this world in a
[2:18:41] minute and the Bible says it's actually
[2:18:45] the one going said the amdon will clean
[2:18:48] up the world
[2:18:52] for the
[2:18:56] Millennium the will be prep the
[2:19:00] civilization as we know it
[2:19:02] today it will be wiped
[2:19:07] CLE everything
[2:19:09] removed everything removed it is coming
[2:19:14] third world war but you see it can't

[2:19:24] can't you understand jesus takes care of
[2:19:27] his

[2:19:37] hallelujahs about his
[2:19:40] business is me his business I am his
[2:19:45] business hallelujah hallelujah amen and
[2:19:48] because of that he said the Seven
[2:19:52] Stars to prepare us for being CAU
[2:19:57] up anybody who will follow that
[2:20:00] star will not go in the
[2:20:04] tribulation anybody who truly genuine
[2:20:07] follow
[2:20:08] that will be filled with the Holy Ghost
[2:20:12] and this will prepare them for the
[2:20:15] catching
[2:20:18] away following a St
[2:20:21] important if you don't follow a star you
[2:20:25] get
[2:20:26] lost how many remember these
[2:20:29] words we have seen his star and we have
[2:20:33] come to worship
[2:20:34] him when Jesus was born no one knew
[2:20:38] where he
[2:20:39] was no one who knew who he
[2:20:42] was but there were wise
[2:20:45] men three wise men from the
[2:20:49] East oh my good
[2:20:53] yes Hallelujah three wise men and when
[2:20:57] they came they came following a
[2:21:01] star why were they wise because they
[2:21:05] could find out the type of start
[2:21:14] follow it was a North
[2:21:17] star and they followed the star
[2:21:21] they followed the star and the star was
[2:21:25] leading them to where Jesus
[2:21:29] was to where the
[2:21:31] Messiah or prophecy was going to be
[2:21:35] born but when they reached Jerusalem
[2:21:38] somewhere they met the king and all the
[2:21:41] priest and they were confused a
[2:21:44] bit that's why Brothers don't ever be
[2:21:48] confused by denominations
[2:21:51] huah or even by
[2:21:53] preachers even preachers can mislead you
[2:21:57] or confuse
[2:21:59] you always read the message on your
[2:22:03] own know the
[2:22:05] message if you just hear what I'm saying
[2:22:07] you you will be
[2:22:10] lost be like the bans after hearing what
[2:22:14] the
[2:22:16] pastor is it like
[2:22:19] that we are not
[2:22:21] religious all of us should dip in the
[2:22:25] oil each of us we should dip our weak in
[2:22:28] the
[2:22:30] oil are you following me and so when
[2:22:33] they reached there they were
[2:22:35] misled and they were telling them
[2:22:37] nonsense denominations only have
[2:22:39] nonsense to
[2:22:42] say that's true and so this man was
[2:22:45] telling them the
[2:22:47] king you what what are you where are you
[2:22:49] going
[2:22:51] we are going to meet the Messiah even me
[2:22:53] have been wanting no he did not want he
[2:22:57] wanted to kill
[2:22:58] you because he was protecting his
[2:23:01] kingdom the denominations are are
[2:23:03] protecting their
[2:23:05] kingdoms they know that this message is
[2:23:08] not of this
[2:23:09] world so we have no kingdoms to
[2:23:13] protect and so they he told them when
[2:23:16] you see him please let me know so I may
[2:23:19] also worship
[2:23:22] him but they were
[2:23:25] wise I said they were
[2:23:27] wise they
[2:23:29] said they didn't go
[2:23:32] back they didn't go back some of you are
[2:23:37] wise you left
[2:23:39] denominations and he won't go
[2:23:44] backen
[2:23:46] Hallelujah yes sir we know what we have
[2:23:49] found
[2:23:52] Hallelujah I have found
[2:23:54] him whom my
[2:23:57] soul so long as
[2:24:00] gra Jesus satisfies my
[2:24:04] long through his blood I am saved and we
[2:24:08] see the the wise
[2:24:10] men when they left the
[2:24:13] palace the star
[2:24:16] reappeared when you go to
[2:24:18] denominations the star will
[2:24:22] disappear don't waste time in their
[2:24:25] books don't waste their your time on
[2:24:29] watching their
[2:24:31] sermons you are
[2:24:34] better spend your time with the
[2:24:39] word because if you waste your
[2:24:42] time the start disappears from and when
[2:24:45] you leave the star you are sure to be
[2:24:48] lost
[2:24:51] are you following me are you following
[2:24:53] me and then the star reappeared ah they
[2:24:57] were happy the Bible says they were
[2:25:00] exceedingly
[2:25:02] joyful because the star
[2:25:05] appeared that's why we are
[2:25:07] excited when we talk about the prophet
[2:25:09] of Our
[2:25:10] Generation why because we know it is not
[2:25:14] about the
[2:25:15] star it is about the direction of the
[2:25:18] star hey
[2:25:22] hallelujah amen that is what we excited
[2:25:25] about so when we caugh William
[2:25:28] BR it is not because of William Bram we
[2:25:31] excited it is about where he is pointing
[2:25:36] us and the star appeared and the star
[2:25:39] LED them and finally they met Jesus the
[2:25:45] Lamb of
[2:25:46] God hallelujah amen hallelujah amen and
[2:25:50] there some men who once
[2:25:53] came under this inspiration and
[2:25:56] Leadership of this
[2:25:59] star of Our
[2:26:01] Generation and they believed it and they
[2:26:04] were following
[2:26:06] it and time
[2:26:08] came when they reached the palace they
[2:26:11] saw the
[2:26:12] money they saw and then they said I no
[2:26:16] longer follow the star
[2:26:22] that we think they more wiser they
[2:26:24] foolish Gans
[2:26:27] 3 whatever I'm saying is in the
[2:26:29] Bible don't
[2:26:34] sayans they started in the
[2:26:36] spirit you find someone who has been
[2:26:38] preaching the
[2:26:40] message 20 years 30 years then they say
[2:26:44] and they they go on on YouTube and
[2:26:46] whatever why I left the message
[2:26:50] with their big
[2:26:52] bellies they never fast and
[2:26:55] pray you left the
[2:26:57] message you can
[2:27:00] live but for me I'm wise I am following
[2:27:04] the St I know where I am
[2:27:07] going I know where I am going I am going
[2:27:10] in the
[2:27:12] Rapture hallelujah amen praise the name
[2:27:15] of the Lord and so we see the church
[2:27:18] ages
[2:27:20] will be for a period of seven um seven
[2:27:24] Church ages the gentle dispensation will
[2:27:26] be for a period of seven Church
[2:27:30] [Music]
[2:27:32] ages give me the next the last
[2:27:36] slide praise the
[2:27:39] Lord and so we see
[2:27:42] here seven golden
[2:27:45] candlesticks and the Seven
[2:27:47] Stars and so we see here
[2:27:50] each each
[2:27:52] age each Church
[2:27:54] age with the star there who are the
[2:27:59] stars
[2:28:01] Angels who are the Angels
[2:28:05] Messengers men on
[2:28:08] Earth
[2:28:09] prophets God used
[2:28:12] men God will use men God will always
[2:28:17] use if you don't want to believe a man
[2:28:21] and follow a
[2:28:23] man you will never know
[2:28:25] Christ that's the
[2:28:27] truth the program of God is he uses a
[2:28:32] man to speak to a
[2:28:36] man and when man
[2:28:39] believes then he will see
[2:28:42] God you remember that man who was in um
[2:28:46] in
[2:28:47] hell in hell he cried
[2:28:50] in hell he suffered and then he was
[2:28:54] being
[2:28:55] alone with the with all you know the
[2:28:59] tears and he saw Abraham he said Father
[2:29:04] Abraham I
[2:29:06] fast please send Lazarus to give me some
[2:29:12] water and you know I always use that
[2:29:16] scripture to
[2:29:17] say don't don't die poor
[2:29:23] even when you believe of
[2:29:24] theth you will make it to
[2:29:27] heaven but even those like
[2:29:30] that ruler in
[2:29:34] hell he despised the brother who was in
[2:29:38] heaven and he wanted to use him as a
[2:29:41] servant send him
[2:29:43] down because he knows he was a beggar on
[2:29:46] Earth don't be a beggar brother
[2:29:50] The God Who who gives you
[2:29:53] salvation is able to give you an
[2:29:56] idea and then he prospers you an idea of
[2:30:00] business you ask for money money is not
[2:30:03] reigning from Heaven he will give you an
[2:30:06] idea build on it and you build
[2:30:10] wealth amen s
[2:30:13] Lazarus and so then he said no sorry
[2:30:15] there is a big um you know we cannot be
[2:30:18] able to pass from
[2:30:22] he said okay forget about that thing now
[2:30:25] I have one more
[2:30:26] request let
[2:30:28] me let me
[2:30:30] go and warn my
[2:30:33] brothers when they see a man from
[2:30:36] Heaven they will believe you know he
[2:30:39] became a preacher
[2:30:42] in don't wait to become a
[2:30:45] preacher begin preaching
[2:30:48] now begin witnessing
[2:30:51] now this one became a preacher not only
[2:30:54] a Believer but even a preacher of the of
[2:30:58] the let me go and tell them and warn
[2:31:01] them of the impending danger that they
[2:31:04] may not come here
[2:31:07] AB don't worry don't worry yourself you
[2:31:11] see on Earth they are men they are
[2:31:16] preachers if your people hear
[2:31:18] them they will be saved and they won't
[2:31:21] come where you are are you hearing what
[2:31:23] I just saying on Earth they are made
[2:31:28] preachers people God is
[2:31:32] using God always uses People for
[2:31:36] People praise the name of the Lord
[2:31:40] otherwise if we do not understand that
[2:31:44] we even begin to fear mentioning brother
[2:31:46] bham
[2:31:48] say I can't fear to say
[2:31:52] I'm going to tell you what he
[2:31:54] said and I'm even going to read it for
[2:31:57] you because he is God's star for Our
[2:32:02] Generation go back in your Bible every
[2:32:06] messenger that came quoted other
[2:32:11] Messengers how did Daniel know the age
[2:32:15] he was
[2:32:16] in he read another Prophet before him
[2:32:20] he said I was
[2:32:22] reading was he reading Jeremiah or
[2:32:24] Isaiah Isaiah yes I was reading
[2:32:29] Isiah so so Daniel you telling us about
[2:32:31] prophet
[2:32:33] Isaiah yes because The God Who used him
[2:32:37] used
[2:32:39] Isaiah and we see Jesus also quoting
[2:32:42] other
[2:32:43] prophets we see
[2:32:45] John
[2:32:48] Isaiah who are you
[2:32:50] John The Voice crying from the
[2:32:54] Wilderness those are not your words John
[2:32:57] where did you get it from Prophet
[2:32:59] Jeremiah prophet Isaiah say
[2:33:02] it Hallelujah so a true
[2:33:06] ministry will not
[2:33:09] fear to quote the words of a true
[2:33:15] Prophet we know them in our
[2:33:18] generation big men
[2:33:20] soal Apostles and
[2:33:23] Prophet they cannot quot William
[2:33:26] Bram but they speak his words every
[2:33:30] time they even title their sermon the
[2:33:33] titles of
[2:33:36] brother and then we hear them but we
[2:33:40] know the truth they're trying to
[2:33:43] meand claiming they have their own
[2:33:46] Revelation but they stealing it from the
[2:33:48] message if any preacher claims to
[2:33:51] believe this
[2:33:52] message and he doesn't quote it he's a
[2:33:56] hypocrite he's not a Believer why am I
[2:33:59] saying that I'll tell you why they did
[2:34:02] not know one
[2:34:03] God before coming to the
[2:34:06] message right they did not know baptism
[2:34:09] in the name of Jesus Christ before they
[2:34:11] came to the message right they did not
[2:34:14] know about
[2:34:17] Holiness they didn't know because they
[2:34:18] didn't do it
[2:34:21] before they came to the message right
[2:34:24] they did not know Church
[2:34:27] order before they read what William bam
[2:34:30] say they did not know that women are not
[2:34:32] supposed to be
[2:34:34] pastors before they came to the message
[2:34:37] their wives were
[2:34:38] preaching but when they came they now
[2:34:40] corrected
[2:34:41] that and now all these things I'm saying
[2:34:45] are in the Bible but they didn't know it
[2:34:49] why they were
[2:34:50] blind the star will open your
[2:34:54] eyes will lead
[2:34:56] you now when they have come and they
[2:34:59] refuse to
[2:35:01] quote what the prophet is saying they
[2:35:04] claiming I believe the Bible no please
[2:35:06] shut up you don't believe the Bible
[2:35:08] because if you did you would have
[2:35:11] believed the man God
[2:35:12] used to reveal it for
[2:35:16] you by saying you believe the Bible
[2:35:20] but you don't believe William Bram it
[2:35:22] means you do not have a revelation of
[2:35:25] what the word of God
[2:35:28] is because what you the revelations you
[2:35:31] have did not come from Heaven
[2:35:36] flying it it came through a
[2:35:38] man by claiming you believe what I'm
[2:35:41] preaching but you don't even want to
[2:35:43] identify yourself with me as your
[2:35:47] pastor there is a problem somewhere
[2:35:50] but you won't shy away my pastor said
[2:35:55] right same thing here you cannot believe
[2:35:59] the message and reject the
[2:36:04] man you cannot reject the man and
[2:36:06] believe the
[2:36:08] message it is one and the same
[2:36:16] thing you see the the the angels
[2:36:20] Paul was the one to the Ephesian Church
[2:36:23] age Iranians to Martin to
[2:36:29] Pumba
[2:36:31] Sisley to Philadelphia and William Bram
[2:36:36] toia
[2:36:38] now was meaning aim
[2:36:41] that and then
[2:36:44] theyed we
[2:36:46] see came from a word
[2:36:49] which means a substance which embalms
[2:36:52] the
[2:36:54] death and it was bitter so we see this
[2:36:58] generation
[2:37:00] of was you know having those two things
[2:37:03] bitterness and
[2:37:05] death not time to go into the details
[2:37:09] pamos you know the word pegamos means
[2:37:14] married that time that season you have
[2:37:17] the years there
[2:37:19] you see the church married with the
[2:37:22] [Music]
[2:37:23] state and they became one they
[2:37:27] married and the first pop was
[2:37:31] instituted we see where it came
[2:37:35] from this church which mared with the
[2:37:37] state became the state
[2:37:41] church and it was a must
[2:37:44] belief in their false
[2:37:46] doctrines and we know the trines be come
[2:37:49] up and water baptisms
[2:37:53] and scap came much later and many other
[2:37:56] things we see that Thea is the
[2:38:00] dominating
[2:38:03] female at that time it is the Dark
[2:38:06] Ages the church almost had no other
[2:38:09] religion but Roman
[2:38:12] Catholicism and if you do not believe
[2:38:14] what they thought they killed
[2:38:16] you they killed Millions
[2:38:21] I can say this in public domain because
[2:38:22] I can prove
[2:38:24] it even if I'm taken to God it is known
[2:38:29] church history it is the truth one of
[2:38:32] the popes recently came up to
[2:38:35] apologize more than 60 million I think
[2:38:38] 68 million
[2:38:42] Christians but we see when sadis
[2:38:45] came by a man called
[2:38:47] Luther Who was the St
[2:38:50] messenger of that age we see that sadis
[2:38:54] means the escaped
[2:38:57] ones this man was a priest in the first
[2:38:59] chch
[2:39:01] system he escaped
[2:39:04] it and he began
[2:39:07] preaching the J shall live by
[2:39:11] faith alone in
[2:39:13] Christ not the Catholic church and many
[2:39:17] followed him and the Reformation of the
[2:39:19] church
[2:39:21] started amen and we see you know and by
[2:39:25] the way all the
[2:39:28] moves we of God but we see that
[2:39:31] denominations were being
[2:39:33] [Applause]
[2:39:34] formed when this these same movements
[2:39:41] organized when they organize they
[2:39:44] die God is not in organization
[2:39:49] God is in his
[2:39:52] word that is why the message
[2:39:55] churches we don't even know how many
[2:39:57] they are in the
[2:39:58] world because we are not an
[2:40:02] organization we don't register
[2:40:05] anybody bring the church
[2:40:08] register brother to be a full member do
[2:40:13] ABC pay this amount of money no we have
[2:40:17] no
[2:40:18] membership and we mean it we have no
[2:40:22] membership but we have
[2:40:26] Fellowship hallelujah amen and we see
[2:40:29] sadis is the escaped
[2:40:31] on they escaped and formulated you know
[2:40:34] a move
[2:40:38] reation but you see later on they they
[2:40:41] be made a Luther and
[2:40:45] organization and we see later on
[2:40:47] Philadelphia philia brother age of
[2:40:50] Brotherly
[2:40:52] kindness brotherly love this was a great
[2:40:55] missionary
[2:40:58] era at time we in school we were
[2:41:01] studying about the
[2:41:05] missionaries it is around the 1700s
[2:41:07] between that and the 19th
[2:41:10] century they went in India Africa
[2:41:13] wherever to to spread the
[2:41:16] gospel of love and Christ
[2:41:19] T about Jesus and love one another and
[2:41:23] things you know but through this age God
[2:41:27] also used the man John
[2:41:29] wisley and John wisley preached the
[2:41:31] message of
[2:41:34] Works he said you know well you cannot
[2:41:36] claim that you you are
[2:41:40] Justified but yet your works are
[2:41:42] still but you're smoking you're
[2:41:46] drinking no no no no no you have to be
[2:41:49] change and so it was mly about that how
[2:41:53] can you claim that you are a follower of
[2:41:56] Jesus and you cannot sacrifice your life
[2:42:00] and go out and do something for God and
[2:42:02] preach the gospel God was with that move
[2:42:06] it was a move of God and LU sorry wisley
[2:42:09] was a messenger he was AAR of that
[2:42:13] generation and you know you know the
[2:42:16] word of God went around the world
[2:42:19] and we see that later on they formed
[2:42:24] methodists and they organized they
[2:42:26] stated and they die and God kept on
[2:42:30] moving on Friday we talked about a man
[2:42:34] called William
[2:42:36] Sim he was a black
[2:42:38] brother in America God used him in such
[2:42:42] a mighty way at the beginning of of the
[2:42:46] Year 1906
[2:42:49] you know we see that you know uh it
[2:42:52] started thean Church
[2:42:55] age but the Pentecost
[2:42:58] move already been going
[2:43:01] on and you know this man they begin
[2:43:05] crying and Desiring to see Acts 2
[2:43:08] fulfilled in their
[2:43:09] life they wanted to see the
[2:43:12] supernatural they wanted to see the
[2:43:14] signs and wonders they wanted to see
[2:43:16] what they saw in the Bible
[2:43:19] only just shall by
[2:43:21] faith and only good works we also want
[2:43:25] to see the power the signs and wonders
[2:43:28] the tongu interpretation and prophecies
[2:43:31] and we wanted to see those things and
[2:43:34] you know what God came
[2:43:37] down ATA Street and began filling them
[2:43:40] with the Holy Spirit they began speaking
[2:43:43] in Tong that was a real genuine
[2:43:47] thing it should have been the True full
[2:43:54] restoration but it was not because it
[2:43:57] lacked another
[2:44:00] ingredient it had the SS of the
[2:44:04] Dynamics the power of God the S wonders
[2:44:07] the tongues the
[2:44:10] healing but it did not have the
[2:44:13] restoration of the word
[2:44:20] and oh my I have a lot to tell you but I
[2:44:23] don't know whether you can take it
[2:44:25] all can you give me a few more
[2:44:28] minutes all right and there God had to
[2:44:33] send another
[2:44:36] Angel this Angel was not coming with his
[2:44:40] own
[2:44:42] idea but his main
[2:44:44] work was to
[2:44:47] restore the word
[2:44:51] are you following
[2:44:52] me praise the name of the
[2:44:55] Lord means people's
[2:44:58] rights and this is the generation we
[2:45:00] living
[2:45:00] in people no longer desire anything
[2:45:03] about
[2:45:04] God they have their rights let them have
[2:45:08] their rights but you see those who fear
[2:45:12] God love will stick with the word more
[2:45:17] than their rights
[2:45:20] and in Malachi 4 verse 5-6 he says
[2:45:25] behold I will send you Elijah the
[2:45:28] prophet before the coming of the Great
[2:45:30] and the Dreadful
[2:45:32] devil and he shall turn the hearts of
[2:45:34] the
[2:45:36] fathers to the children and the hearts
[2:45:38] of the children to their fathers lest I
[2:45:42] come and smile the Earth to the
[2:45:44] C so we understand please give me your
[2:45:47] attention for the few more moments
[2:45:50] we understand that this Elijah the
[2:45:53] prophet is come to the world five
[2:45:57] times first elah
[2:46:00] the second
[2:46:03] elah
[2:46:04] thirdly John the Baptist that is the one
[2:46:08] the Bible speaking about
[2:46:10] here before the great day of the
[2:46:13] Lord but there is another one who is
[2:46:18] supposed to come before for the Dreadful
[2:46:20] day of the
[2:46:24] Lord can you go behind the
[2:46:27] second before the great the Dreadful day
[2:46:29] of the
[2:46:31] Lord there is an Elijah supposed
[2:46:34] to before the Rapture before the
[2:46:38] tribulation is an Elijah supposed to
[2:46:40] come Hallelujah before that day of the
[2:46:44] Lord
[2:46:45] comes before the tribulations before the
[2:46:48] rapture
[2:46:49] just at the
[2:46:51] end of the Gentile
[2:46:55] dispensation there will be an Elijah
[2:46:59] Prophet who will come and his work will
[2:47:03] be the
[2:47:07] simplest he will not start anything
[2:47:11] new he will not bring any new
[2:47:14] teaching he will not bring any new
[2:47:16] idea but his work is simple to
[2:47:22] restore Hallelujah everything the
[2:47:25] apostles
[2:47:26] preached to bring it back
[2:47:29] again to the church so that the people
[2:47:32] can be
[2:47:34] prepared for the Rapture praise the lord
[2:47:39] we are children of God our hearts by
[2:47:43] that Elijah's message give me the
[2:47:46] next that last one of the last churches
[2:47:50] through the ministry of William
[2:47:52] brother who is he he is our
[2:47:56] star for
[2:47:59] our hallelujah hallelujah amen he's our
[2:48:04] star are you following William
[2:48:07] br oh yes because he's my
[2:48:10] star but don't you worry he's not the
[2:48:14] big deal
[2:48:15] here I am following him God is leading
[2:48:19] me
[2:48:20] somewhere he's leading me to the
[2:48:23] word he's leading me to
[2:48:25] Christ not to
[2:48:27] himself not to his church but to
[2:48:32] Christ and here is one thing they don't
[2:48:35] understand the ministries of the
[2:48:38] prophets have three
[2:48:41] pools every say three
[2:48:45] pools come on tell your neighbor three
[2:48:47] pools
[2:48:50] but people don't
[2:48:53] understand the first
[2:48:56] pool is the
[2:48:58] miracles signs and
[2:49:01] wonders that was in the ministry of
[2:49:03] Jesus
[2:49:04] Christ when he started out oh people
[2:49:08] loved
[2:49:09] it and
[2:49:11] wonders God
[2:49:14] mirac being turned
[2:49:17] [Music]
[2:49:19] everybody came it attracted
[2:49:24] thousands second
[2:49:27] pool
[2:49:29] designment people reduced a bit but
[2:49:33] still many we see Jesus designing
[2:49:38] nathani we see him designing the woman
[2:49:40] of the
[2:49:41] well we see him telling Peter his
[2:49:44] name your name is so and so problem is
[2:49:49] this and this people loved that is a man
[2:49:53] of God William is a man of God all these
[2:50:00] Pentecostals you goarch about
[2:50:02] them they talked great big things
[2:50:05] about why because of the first pool of
[2:50:09] his and the second pool now what we call
[2:50:13] pools his
[2:50:15] faces what was pulling people to his
[2:50:18] ministry
[2:50:21] but when it comes to the third
[2:50:23] phase of his ministry just like Jesus
[2:50:28] many walk
[2:50:29] away after he did all the
[2:50:32] Miracles he now
[2:50:35] said he that will not eat my
[2:50:38] flesh and drink my
[2:50:41] blood is not part of
[2:50:43] me the ones who were saying amen
[2:50:50] say
[2:50:54] Amen they
[2:50:56] began they walked
[2:50:58] out Jesus was
[2:51:00] wondering the church is becoming empty
[2:51:03] where are the people going am I not a
[2:51:05] powerful
[2:51:06] preacher said
[2:51:08] no you offended
[2:51:11] them those things those words we have
[2:51:14] strong they they not used to
[2:51:17] it and then Jesus also told do you also
[2:51:20] want to go my disciples
[2:51:23] go now what made them stay in this third
[2:51:28] pool one thing Peter answered to whom
[2:51:33] shall
[2:51:36] we who has the
[2:51:39] word
[2:51:42] etal that brother that sister that is
[2:51:47] the reason why we leaving this
[2:51:51] message hallelujah amen we are not even
[2:51:54] here for just
[2:51:56] Miracles we are here because of the
[2:51:59] word the opening of the word the
[2:52:03] revealing of the
[2:52:04] word when William Bram reached the third
[2:52:07] phase of his
[2:52:09] ministry the ones who are saying is a
[2:52:11] great big man Mighty Man
[2:52:14] of we don't want you to preach for us
[2:52:18] no we we're no long associating with you
[2:52:21] why because he simply preaching what the
[2:52:23] apostles
[2:52:25] preaching and he said I am responsible
[2:52:27] for this
[2:52:29] world he said they have been pulling me
[2:52:31] to join their
[2:52:32] denominations I cannot join it you have
[2:52:35] to understand we have a message to
[2:52:37] preach he said I cannot join
[2:52:40] anything we only are responsible to the
[2:52:43] message God has given
[2:52:46] us and this message
[2:52:49] is not just
[2:52:51] information this message is preparing
[2:52:55] the
[2:52:56] bride for the coming
[2:53:00] brid hallelujah amen amen hallelujah
[2:53:04] hallelujah

[2:53:08] the opening of the
[2:53:11] world something else something else you
[2:53:16] know what comes with it with it
[2:53:19] comes the
[2:53:20] Power with it comes the
[2:53:24] supernatural amen speaking things into
[2:53:27] existence where is it the power of the
[2:53:30] third
[2:53:32] pH when is it
[2:53:34] active it is active

[2:53:55] third message is not only
[2:53:58] words there is a
[2:54:01] power behind it it is already
[2:54:06] active amen it is not coming it is here

[2:54:23] does God set free oh yes he does signs
[2:54:27] and wonders happening Miracles T
[2:54:32] interpretation that is our
[2:54:35] portion as true message
[2:54:39] Believers because we are under a true
[2:54:43] Ministry hallelujah amen come on give
[2:54:46] him praise
[2:54:49] [Applause]
[2:54:52] tend Hallelujah Hallelujah Jesus that is
[2:54:56] what the devil doesn't
[2:54:59] understand that's where many many
[2:55:03] preachers this
[2:55:05] message that's where they have gone
[2:55:08] wrong that is where we have gone wrong
[2:55:11] where we believe the
[2:55:14] mechanics the word we believe the power
[2:55:19] this message also has
[2:55:22] power yes
[2:55:25] Hallelujah yes
[2:55:26] sir and by the way one of the
[2:55:31] qualities of a true
[2:55:34] Ministry amen is we see it in Apostle
[2:55:37] Paul and I want to wrap up now three
[2:55:41] things we already saw he was absolutely
[2:55:44] true to the world
[2:55:48] never deviated from the
[2:55:50] world no matter what give me that
[2:55:53] seven he never left the
[2:55:56] world he was true to the word if you
[2:56:00] want to know you are under a two
[2:56:03] Ministry that ministry will be Bible
[2:56:08] based give me the third one it will be
[2:56:10] word
[2:56:11] based this ministry will be true to the
[2:56:16] work it will never
[2:56:19] deviat it will never
[2:56:21] leave right from the beginning Paul said
[2:56:26] the
[2:56:27] pattern of that true
[2:56:30] Ministry so if we want to know the other
[2:56:34] Messengers The Other Angels it is easy
[2:56:37] you just find out Paul how was the
[2:56:40] nature of his
[2:56:41] ministry number one he was true to the
[2:56:45] world whatever he preached
[2:56:49] every messenger who will come his
[2:56:52] inspiration will fit in the same
[2:56:56] inspiration that Paul
[2:56:58] had he was true to the word he never
[2:57:02] deviated from it hallelujah amen Paul
[2:57:06] was
[2:57:07] speed amen not he was
[2:57:11] unorganized
[2:57:13] Spirit as when God moved upon Moses to
[2:57:16] lead up the children of Israel out ofp
[2:57:20] Jerusalem's counc never sent Paul
[2:57:24] out none of these
[2:57:27] Messengers was sent by any
[2:57:30] councel none of them was sent by any
[2:57:34] denomination in the second age there was
[2:57:38] a man called
[2:57:39] poop He was the spiritual father
[2:57:43] ofus but
[2:57:45] irus was a milit
[2:57:50] against the
[2:57:52] organization but he was
[2:57:54] leaning towards the
[2:57:56] world but you see polyup was leaning
[2:58:00] towards the
[2:58:01] organization and the spirit said he's
[2:58:04] not
[2:58:06] PO is not po God does not send
[2:58:13] organization to lead The
[2:58:16] Messengers all these men
[2:58:22] Spirit no C sent them
[2:58:25] out nor did it have any
[2:58:28] power or jurisdiction over
[2:58:32] him God and God
[2:58:34] Alone God sent Paul God sent Iranians
[2:58:39] God sent Martin God sent Kum God sent
[2:58:42] Luther Luther was in the system and he
[2:58:46] rejected the system
[2:58:49] he
[2:58:51] protested and protested movement started
[2:58:53] with
[2:58:57] him where do you get the
[2:58:59] authority I get it from the
[2:59:02] wall the man was obsessed with the
[2:59:08] word God sent
[2:59:10] Wiley God sent Bram Bram was in
[2:59:15] Baptist but when he received the
[2:59:17] revelation
[2:59:19] of Divine Healing and many other things
[2:59:22] his
[2:59:23] preacher told him he his
[2:59:26] preacher told him you are running
[2:59:29] crazy you have a problem he said all
[2:59:33] right let me go with the word I will
[2:59:35] still preach the
[2:59:37] word and all of them respected what he
[2:59:43] preached because it was the
[2:59:46] word Paul was not of men
[2:59:49] of God but there is a second
[2:59:53] quality his ministry was in the
[2:59:57] power of the
[3:00:01] spirit he was
[3:00:03] demonstrating the spoken word and the
[3:00:06] written
[3:00:07] word that's how you know true
[3:00:10] Ministry they will
[3:00:14] demonstrate not talk
[3:00:16] about demon
[3:00:20] the spoken word and the written word and
[3:00:24] when is I told you here is a Ministry of
[3:00:28] William BR is not a man who just spoke
[3:00:31] spoke spoke
[3:00:32] spoke he's a man who would
[3:00:34] preach and he would
[3:00:37] say he's here now the Holy Spirit I put
[3:00:42] every spirit in this room under my
[3:00:46] control for glory of
[3:00:50] God and then he would say for what I
[3:00:53] preached is the
[3:00:55] truth let him come and
[3:00:57] vindicate the god of the bible let him
[3:01:01] come and in a moment when he would say
[3:01:04] those
[3:01:05] words there would be
[3:01:09] silence just like we hearing
[3:01:12] now you could brother bisc
[3:01:15] said brother bisar is my mentor in the
[3:01:20] and and and he would say that you would
[3:01:23] even
[3:01:25] hear a need of falling on the
[3:01:28] ground when he said those words there
[3:01:31] was a
[3:01:33] harush over the
[3:01:37] congregation and then he would be
[3:01:40] silent and he had eyes if you see' seen
[3:01:43] his
[3:01:44] pictures like eag eyes
[3:01:48] inside and when he sees you or looks at
[3:01:52] you it would be like an
[3:01:56] ego then he would look over the
[3:01:59] congregation is watching the movement of
[3:02:03] the
[3:02:04] Angel and that angel was with
[3:02:09] us Friday night here
[3:02:13] hallelujah amen was
[3:02:16] yes and I believe
[3:02:19] he gathers around people who believe
[3:02:21] this
[3:02:24] message and then he would begin calling
[3:02:26] out people by
[3:02:28] name you say your
[3:02:30] name is
[3:02:34] Dixon you're from
[3:02:36] Ginger you're not from here now those
[3:02:39] not knowing those
[3:02:41] statement and he would go he would go
[3:02:44] more than
[3:02:45] that he would go into your mind
[3:02:49] into your heart you've been worried
[3:02:53] about your future you've been thinking
[3:02:56] about
[3:03:01] specific about what is happening in
[3:03:04] your and he would
[3:03:08] specifically and let me tell you this
[3:03:11] each of those
[3:03:12] times he never went
[3:03:15] wrong not once
[3:03:18] forget about what you're seeing these
[3:03:20] days from the TV
[3:03:22] prophets they miss they heit and
[3:03:26] Miss but for him never went
[3:03:31] wrong why it was
[3:03:35] God who was there doing it not the
[3:03:39] man where are the stars in the right
[3:03:42] hand of Jesus Christ it was him moving
[3:03:46] him around
[3:03:48] and then this
[3:03:51] designment you know until
[3:03:54] people could believe what he preached is
[3:03:56] the
[3:03:58] truth and you know he would preach and
[3:04:00] Crush women preachers and
[3:04:04] make and you know
[3:04:08] thism and then he would say if I preach
[3:04:11] the truth let God come for and vate and
[3:04:15] God came down each time
[3:04:19] and you you look at me now and you tell
[3:04:22] me William bam was a false
[3:04:23] Propet there's a problem
[3:04:26] with a very big
[3:04:28] problem Paul did not just preach he
[3:04:34] demonstrated what he preached through
[3:04:37] the power of the
[3:04:40] spirit hallelujah hallelujah and there
[3:04:44] was an evident fruit
[3:04:48] of that god-given
[3:04:49] Ministry now as I'm closing I want to
[3:04:53] finish with
[3:04:55] this people can debate the teachings
[3:04:57] that brother bam
[3:05:01] Tau people can debate the manifestations
[3:05:04] and the
[3:05:08] gifts but here is something they cannot
[3:05:12] de Paul the third
[3:05:16] quality that he had in his ministry to
[3:05:19] prove it was a true Ministry he had
[3:05:23] fruit in his
[3:05:25] ministry fruit now you you wondering
[3:05:28] what's
[3:05:29] fruit you shall know them by
[3:05:34] their listen to what Paul had to
[3:05:37] say I am jealous over you with Godly
[3:05:41] jealousy for I have spoused you to one
[3:05:44] husband that I may present you the CH
[3:05:46] vir Christ
[3:05:50] I be if I be not an apostle unto
[3:05:53] others yet dless I am to
[3:05:56] you for the
[3:05:58] seal everybody seal of my
[3:06:02] apost are you in the
[3:06:05] Lord
[3:06:07] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen I am
[3:06:11] become a fool in
[3:06:14] glory ye have compelled me
[3:06:18] for I ought to have been commanded for
[3:06:20] of
[3:06:23] you for in nothing I am behind the very
[3:06:26] chiefest of
[3:06:29] Apostles though I be
[3:06:32] nothing praise the name of the
[3:06:35] Lord
[3:06:37] Paul could be able to say these
[3:06:40] things to this people because Paul knew
[3:06:45] even at one point he said you have 10
[3:06:47] you may have 10,000
[3:06:52] instructors yet have you not many
[3:06:54] fathers and he said I have begotten you
[3:06:57] in the
[3:06:59] gospel you are the Seal of my
[3:07:03] apost I've espoused you to
[3:07:07] Christ I BST because of
[3:07:10] you that was Paul's
[3:07:14] fuit William Bram William Bram had fruit
[3:07:18] of the
[3:07:20] ministry and he knew oh my
[3:07:23] God he knew he had it before he
[3:07:28] did why because he was a prophet God
[3:07:31] spoke to him and God
[3:07:34] told
[3:07:37] record all the messages you're
[3:07:40] preaching because it will be
[3:07:43] food for my
[3:07:45] bride in the end
[3:07:48] time was that not a prophetic
[3:07:53] thing and brother would say these steps
[3:07:58] are listened
[3:08:00] to these steps are listened
[3:08:03] to by millions of people all over the
[3:08:07] world they are
[3:08:09] recorded and they are going to be
[3:08:13] translated into every language
[3:08:17] there in the
[3:08:19] forest and they'll be reading
[3:08:22] it amen am I communic
[3:08:27] someone we are the
[3:08:31] evidence
[3:08:32] Hallelujah if oh my God I feel like
[3:08:36] taking thanks right now I wanted to
[3:08:38] listen brother B was a prophet of God if
[3:08:43] someone doesn't believe that he is too
[3:08:46] late
[3:08:48] he's too late why you you cannot come
[3:08:53] now and claim he was
[3:08:56] a why because you are too
[3:08:59] late already there are people all over
[3:09:01] the
[3:09:02] world in every nation on Earth who have
[3:09:07] believed this
[3:09:10] message we are the evident
[3:09:13] FL of Mal
[3:09:18] that is not all when you see these
[3:09:21] people's
[3:09:23] lives their lives are
[3:09:26] changed they are filled with the Holy
[3:09:28] Ghost God is moving in their life God is
[3:09:32] doing the
[3:09:33] supernatural we are the evidence
[3:09:36] F of this true
[3:09:41] Ministry they are almost in every
[3:09:44] country on
[3:09:45] earth now that's not all
[3:09:48] devil that's not all there is more in
[3:09:52] these people God is proving
[3:09:55] himself yet
[3:09:57] again just like it was in the days of

[3:10:04] healed the demon possessed are being
[3:10:07] delivered Sinners are being set

[3:10:36] interpret the same way the Bible
[3:10:39] say when the Pentecost say we just speak
[3:10:43] we just speak it is the spirit but the
[3:10:46] Bible say
[3:10:47] there should be
[3:10:49] interpretation and they said no and God
[3:10:52] sends William the Star Messenger to the
[3:10:56] last age and he preaches the message we
[3:10:59] are the
[3:11:00] fruit we are the fruit and everywhere

[3:11:23] behind
[3:11:25] them to confirm what they have
[3:11:29] said so much talking about the first
[3:11:34] prees in the message we don't have time
[3:11:37] for that now let's talk about the true

[4:09:26] [Music]
[4:09:27] offering you sometimes you find like
[4:09:29] myself I come to church and I check
[4:09:31] myself I have no
[4:09:33] cash I'm like I forgot the money at home
[4:09:36] but I have my phone and I can give on my
[4:09:40] phone so from today I've been one those
[4:09:43] missing to give
[4:09:46] offering but from today God has opened a
[4:09:50] way for me I will no longer miss giving
[4:09:53] offing because I just have to go on my

[4:10:06] ones uh there have been people that have
[4:10:08] been sending me money for Ties on my
[4:10:11] phone number
[4:10:15] I um understand sometimes you're in the
[4:10:18] middle of the week you don't want to use
[4:10:19] the
[4:10:20] funds you can't wait until you come to
[4:10:24] church uh so you have to send
[4:10:26] it um but then I have a policy
[4:10:31] here that all offerings and
[4:10:35] ties are managed by our
[4:10:41] Treasures as much as
[4:10:44] the ti offerings are supposed to be for
[4:10:47] the pastor for the ministry of the
[4:10:56] word to what we are taugh but I always
[4:11:00] wanted to go through
[4:11:02] that so that we can be able to
[4:11:06] account uh by the end of the year we can
[4:11:08] be able to let you know look you gave
[4:11:10] this much you did this much
[4:11:15] but if you send it to
[4:11:17] me someone will call me as soon as you
[4:11:19] send
[4:11:21] it P I have an
[4:11:23] issue and I have to send that money away
[4:11:27] and the treasurers have missed out
[4:11:30] recording so because of that we would
[4:11:34] like all
[4:11:36] ties all
[4:11:38] tis to be given in two
[4:11:41] ways we have our TI
[4:11:44] here we shall get
[4:11:46] envelopes we working on them if you've
[4:11:49] noticed we are trying to
[4:11:55] Rebrand yeah on if you see on the

[4:12:01] looking so we are going to get also
[4:12:03] envelopes for you so that from here you
[4:12:07] can be able to take

[4:18:32] now I hear other group saying we are
[4:18:34] also
[4:18:35] coming that's the kind of thing we want
[4:18:38] and if you are part of the church and
[4:18:41] you're not contributing weekly
[4:18:44] don't wait until you get the big
[4:18:47] money please if you want to prosper hear
[4:18:51] me our God has already I told you here
[4:18:54] before that people who are giv towards
[4:18:58] this they're going to be
[4:19:01] rich how God will give them Grace and
[4:19:07] opportunities that he will give them
[4:19:09] Financial
[4:19:11] breakthrough because their heart is
[4:19:13] glued on the work of
[4:19:16] God and I said that and God speaks
[4:19:20] through a person who I have even
[4:19:21] understood later is not even a member of
[4:19:23] this
[4:19:25] church he says he she's a sister
[4:19:29] actually let me read this
[4:19:33] again um however in the next part of the
[4:19:36] vision the water transformed into Clean
[4:19:39] and Clear Water
[4:19:43] I believe that river is what I preached
[4:19:46] about here the other
[4:19:47] time and he said Fin and that's my
[4:19:50] prayer that the Lord will give us a
[4:19:52] river at this
[4:19:54] Fellowship that everyone who comes will
[4:19:58] drink and get
[4:20:00] drunk and their thir will be quenched
[4:20:05] and it says finally and I love this
[4:20:08] finally because he saying after he has
[4:20:10] done this after he has questioned
[4:20:14] then finally my God the sister picked a
[4:20:17] very powerful choice of
[4:20:20] words when I read it I could tell it was
[4:20:22] of the
[4:20:24] Lord I Saw The River overflowing with
[4:20:29] [Music]
[4:20:33] dollars by the way have you come to
[4:20:35] think of it not in Uganda
[4:20:41] shs you know all rich men don't keep
[4:20:43] Uganda
[4:20:46] [Laughter]
[4:20:50] Shillings they keep it in
[4:20:52] dollars because it is
[4:20:55] much so when you when you start your
[4:20:57] company and
[4:20:59] business as long as you give to the work
[4:21:01] of God you will earn in
[4:21:06] dollars now I saw the river overflowing
[4:21:10] with dolls
[4:21:13] representing an
[4:21:17] abundance of financial
[4:21:22] blessings the sister who saw this
[4:21:25] Vision like I said has not been a member
[4:21:27] of this church doesn't know what I've
[4:21:30] been preaching doesn't know what
[4:21:32] commments I've given I can only say this

[4:21:47] dollars no it's coming to those who have
[4:21:49] been

[4:21:54] for my seat to be big so I can give

[4:22:03] small you begin with one
[4:22:07] AC when you
