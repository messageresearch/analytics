morning I want the devil to know that he's a liar so if you will allow me and maybe the musician could just come I just want to do one thing this morning I want to take my hand and rub it in the face of the devil and tell him that he is not a winner my God my God is your winner and he made you winners so I want to do this there's a song that we sing in New Zealand I'll try it I'm not a singer but

Him and we want to give him the best that we can give him hallelujah amen so like brother B said I have a genuine burden for young people I have young people in my home I've got a 23y old daughter an 18y old son a 15y old daughter and a 13y old son so I know what young people are experiencing and I want to I want to just express to you before we go into the word the burden that I have for you over this weekend so I wrote it down here to anybody that has not experienced the realities of God my prayer for you is that you will have a glorious Born Again experience this weekend there would be such a power in that experience that when you leave here the devil will know that you have been with Jesus your friends will know that you have been with Jesus J and you will know that you have been with Jesus now I say that this morning because many many years ago I was a young man that came into a meeting like this I was a young man I grew up in the message I knew the quotes of brother Brandon I could quote and I could win you with quotes that was what I knew but I did not know the god of William Bram all I knew was the dead letter but no experience until the 25th of December 1995 I walked into a meeting like this I thought I was kind of cool I had my hair slick back and I knew in that meeting the P will come he'll read a scripture he'll read some quotes of brother Brandon tell some good stories and the meeting would end a normal message meeting but what I did not know was that day was my day of the calendar of God that day 24th of December 1995 God swept into the meeting he came to my seat transformed my life then this Bible was no more dead letter but it was life and it is stole life [Music] today brother BOS said that there's someone here today that there's an appointment with the supernatural God as the word Goes Forth as the word is preached you sit in your seat and you say Lord I need it father I want you to transform my life and my God is a big God there is nothing that he cannot do so I don't care in what state you think you might be in this morning my God can take you from there and he can lift you up and he can put you there and then he can take you from there and he can take you up and he put you there but you and me we've got to cry out so let's cry out for more of Jesus you see brother brandham says as we receive the word we become the word that is what this message is producing in this generation let me read your quote God's provided a way of healing brother brandham says now you can preach the word you can preach the word you can explain the word but you have to receive the word if there's anything and everything that you forget after this meeting don't forget I must receive the word brother bam says that's what set the fire when you receive it he says you receive the revelation of this word and I'm grateful for this message which has opened this Bible to me personally brother Bram says as you receive the word something Supernatural happens you see you and I we are a supernatural we believe in a supernatural God so he says this he says as you receive the word something slips out of the Unseen World he says it comes rolling down through a mystical Channel somewhere into your soul and maybe you might not understand maybe you might not see what the Bible says but as you receive the word my God he comes your way and he opens you understanding he gives you Revelation but the says then you say now I see it and do you know the power of receiving the word it's not just something that happens on the inside brother Brandon says you see it on the outside I'll read you the quote he says as you receive the word and as God comes your way he says your eyes brighten up he says your LPS that was said that was said starts turning into a smile he says every muscle in your body [Music] rejoices that's the power of the word but you and me we need to receive the word so as the preachers are going to come behind the sacred desk behind this desk and as they going to preach the word my encouragement my encouragement to you receive it receive because when you receive the word you come to realize that we are a generation they cannot lose Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle Satan lost the battle he didn't let the devil win so you a generation that cannot lose in the message Angel of the Covenant brother brandham says the Christian has doesn't have any worry in the world not one wor in the world they should be the freest happiest people in all the world and you know what as I was watching you and as you were singing I see the Happ and then he says this you can't lose so when you leave here today remember you are a generation that's my title today you are a generation that cannot lose doesn't matter how the situation might look like doesn't matter how I feel I might wake up this morning and feel so down that does not matter you are an overcomer do you know what the fact the fact the reason that you are here this morning you did not have to come to church at half 6 in the morning at that half 6 at 6:00 some people have their best sleep but you prove to the devil that you are and overcomer so don't listen don't listen do not listen to to any lie that the devil tells you because whenever he opens his mouth he lies so the devil will tell you that you a sinner the devil will tell you that you are weak when he tells you that you turn to him and you say devil shut up I'm an overcomer I'm a Believer I love the message what did God through Brother David tell you last night you are generation that does the Greater Works how many were your last night can I see your hands you believe that this morning you believe that you are a generation and you know what Brother David said this is not something in the future it's now young people appreciate what you have appreciate the word brother Brandon says the word of God will defeat Satan anywhere you know these things right any time any place of any condition the and my Jesus came to show you that you can just use it is WR and the devil has to go so be encouraged with that this morning realize we have something special this Bible it's not a closed book to you and me our God has opened it because this word is showing you and me who God is we see who God is in the word this word shows you who the devil is because we need to know our enemy P's word also shows you my brother who you are so you got to see yourself is the way oh let's give the Lord a hand of [Applause] Praise don't you just love the Lord Jesus I feel so good preaching to you because I can see that you you know what I'm talking about I can see that you love the Lord Jesus continue to love [Music] him continue to give you [Music] all even when you feel tired raise your hands say Jesus I love you let's do that everybody raise your hands say Jesus I love you oh my my my my my my my Give the Lord a hand of Praise let's give a shout let's [Applause] Glory Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah praise the Lord yes I love you Jesus I love you Jesus I love [Music] you [Music] hallelujah hallelujah you may be seated now brother brandham comes in the message the contest and he tells us a contest it's a strength sorry it's a test of strength a test of strength and he who say in those days the Indians would make a fire and a few of them would stand that side a few of them would stand the side and they'll have a rope in between and then the group the side the group the side and there's a group that side and they'll hold the rope and they'll pull and the objective is to get that group into the fire my brother BR says the greatest contest that there is is between the church that's you and Satan you know that right you experience it every day the devil is pulling and God is pulling the god in you so brother brandham says the great strength of Satan the great strength of Satan Satan is powerful but my God he's more powerful don't forget that my brother br says the great the great strength of Satan he says and we want to speak of the great strength of God in his church God in you God in Me and brother B would say this contest started in heaven we know the Bible right Satan was kicked out and since then he's used all his strength and his strategy to try to pull God's people into the fire but remember this remember this Satan lost the battle my God Jesus let the devil win he goes on in the contest and we know who has the most power do you know Satan is here my God is here you tell me who has got the most power my God he's got the most power so when the Devil comes and tries to mess you up because that's what he wants to do you see I said earlier this Bible tells you who you are the devil Satan does not want you to know who you are because when you get to know who you are the devil will run and that's why the devil wants to keep you down here but this weekend can be your [Music] weekend let that be your confession say after me say this this weekend is my weekend first weekend is my weekend you see Christianity being a Christian is not just about being a good person it's not about just obeying all the rules do you know before God transformed my life I thought that this message is just a bunch of difficult rules and do you know how hard it was for me as a young person to try to obey all these rules but you know when God came my way and he transformed my life I realize it's not just about a bunch of rules but young people it is a life that is love and because you love Jesus you want to do what the word says I must do you see this message is about Christ being formed in his young people Colossians 1:27 says Christ in you I want to read you a quote this quote I I just love it because this quote speaks of me in the Statue of a perfect man brother Brandon says now many times we question what is this message all about who is Brother BR why did he come I just want to read you a quote and there's many quotes out there but this quote is personal to brother T brother T brother T God bless you he's doing a good job right you're doing a good job God bless you to follow my South African accent statue of a perfect man we are not building an organization brother brandham says I'm not here this morning to bold an organization Christ never sent me me to build organization Christ sent me to build individuals you and you and you to the statue of Jesus Christ that you might be a Power House a house holding so much power that's word is power and this word is being formed in you so this message is Bolding a powerful young people people don't think because I am young I cannot do much there is an authority there is a power that lays within you God wants you to recognize and that is why you and I must receive the word so Christianity or being in the message it's not just about being a good person but there is something powerful happening in each one of you now if you will allow me just for a few minutes I want to just go over some quotes of brother Bram and I I titled this section that there is a secret to living a Victorious Life you see you can Victorious it's laying inside of you you might not recognize it but God he sees it he sees that there's a power within his young people but maybe his young people is's not see it brother Bron if you will allow me gives us some instruction he says now he says I'm up against something he says I'm not much of a Preacher but if I could get people to see that they have to absolutely come clean with God then I believe I've Had The Authority by Jesus Christ to break the power of any demon that there is because brother you know brother brand who tell us when he was 12 years old when he was 12 years old there was an evil spirit hanging over him trying to tell him wait a bit don't give yourself over to God and I've come to realize that with many of our young people they want to break free but they are afraid to come clean they are afraid to repent now that word repent am I allowed to say that in a message church I believe yes because we make mistakes right brother is about flesh T makes mistakes and what the devil wants to do he sees you make the mistake and then he keeps you there he makes you feel so guilty he makes you feel so embarrassed I cannot confess that but you know that when you repent and if you make the wrong right my God can take you [Music] higher so the says here in believing God talks about the young man he asked the young man do you want to be saved the young man tells brother brandham I don't know brother bham says the devil is keeping that boy brother Brandon says that boy he wants to do right but there's a spirit a demon a power that's holding that boy down now if I am speaking to anybody this morning I want you to know that you can go free if you look around you just look at your brother and your sister you are not looking at a loser right you are looking at a winner I am on The Winning Side The Winning Side The Winning Side I am on The Winning Side come now I am on The Winning Side The Winning Side I am one the [Music] L is there another verse Satan lost Satan lost the battle Satan

this is a generation that cannot lose I am that generation that cannot lose now we in a Warfare God has come here today through the lips of our brother Taz and he told you I know you in a battle between right and wrong I know you have pressure from the world I know what you're going through I know it is difficult for you he also said Satan has power he admitted it he said it it's the power he gave him so he knows he has it but then again he said to you you the generation that cannot lose because he that is in US is greater than the one that is in the world so fear not the battle you are fighting you are on The Winning [Music] Side hallelujah hallelujah that's what our brother also David told us that we in a Warfare so listen young [Music] people God is preparing preparing our hearts to receive more of him these words are not just spoken to excite us but we are soldiers and we're being motivated within our soul to fight and win and we are going to win but I'm saying we are going to win in this life God has placed Us in this generation he knew all the demons in this generation but said you are winers you are Overcomers so we must win the devil cannot stop us from that whatever

experience and my prayer for everyone that is camping here this weekend some I know we have some new people who are not like who are new to the message and they don't know what and he mentioned they don't know what it's all about and some think it's just a set of quotes and and a set of regulations and rules but the message is much more than that the message is a life it is God living in you and uh this weekend my prayer also is that those who have not yet come to that level to understand the message that way they will be able to come to that place the devil should not keep you in fear and if there is something that is wrong in your life God had to send someone from New Zealand to come and tell you just make it right just repent and it will be behind you and if you're struggling you can
