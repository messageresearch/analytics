[Music] for Philipp pH for e for [Music] pH for [Music] for so uh was traveling to the US for some time we will try to find a contact for you so that you can get some Believers there one thing I love about the message is you know it's scatter all over the world even in places where there are no churches you will at least find some Believers where where you can fellowship with them praise God so tonight I'm just sharing uh with you is that okay now is it fine Brother Isaac I was told that my microphone was muted so I just wanted to be sure that everybody can hear yeah it's fine okay so I'm speaking on press on toward the goal uh toward the goal I mean not no just say what I'm saying press on toward the goal yes tell your neighbor press on toward the go nice to see you sister Esther I know you went through some things but I want to tell you tonight press on my sister press on amen that's just all I have to say tonight we are going to read from the Amplified version and see from verse S I will just read it directly and my brother will interpret directly from me here amen but whatever former things were gained to me that were gain me as I thought [Music] then this things once regarded as advancement in Merit I have come to consider as loss absolutely [Music] worthless for the sake of Christ and the purpose which he has given my life a purpose which God has given our life before we came to Christ before we came to the message we had things we thought were gain we had things which we thought were of value we regarded them as advancements in marriage but then Paul here to the Philippians he writes to them and he gives a testimony and I I trust it can be our testimony tonight each of us I have come to consider those things as loss absolutely worthless for the sake of Christ meaning Christ is greater than all the things that you thought were of value if you if you believe Jesus Christ but there is something of value more than him then you've not yet believed on him perfectly you should come to that level of your life where everything else is worthless for the sake of Christ and this purpose which he has given in your life you believe Jesus you receive a new purpose I see sister doas tonight you wanted to be a nun I don't know whether you still remember that she wanted to be a nun and she even went there how long did you study one year so this one was a n in [Music] making but one day the message came her way and she put all that behind her became worthless for the treasure she had found I believe every believer should be that way why is it hard for people to believe a Christian life because many when they come to Christ they still do not treasure him they don't see him as a treasure they see him as an option they see him as a something good in their life but they have other things are important for me when I received this message I accepted Christ in my heart everything else became worthless everything became worthless he is the only thing of value everything else comes after praise God praise God I have a hierarchy in my life number one Jesus Christ that one is number one my wife cannot take that place my children cannot take that place nobody can take that place Jesus Christ Tak the First Priority One relationship with him number two my wife my mother can't even take that place my wife is number two after Christ not even my children she's number two why because brother bam tells us that is the second best thing after salvation if you're married your spouse must be number two if you value something more than that which is not Christ you have a problem in your marriage and you need counseling but I believe all of you who are married here number one God number two your wife your husband and then number three can be your children your family and and and and then everything else comes after for me number four is Ministry Pastor you you put your family and your wife above Ministry Ministry is not salvation Christ is number one but Christ is not Ministry you find very many pastors and preachers they lose their family in the process of doing Ministry I believe that Ministry cannot replace family and family cannot replace Ministry has their place before I go to preach before I go for a missionary trip I have to make sure that my wife and my children have something to eat even if I come here on the pulpit and I'm preaching a very good sermon if I had if I had displeased my wife at home and you know slapped All My Children before I I'm really wasting time because I have not been good at home what does the scripture say can you go with me to the book of First Timothy this is not even part of what I wanted to preach about that verse brought it let us go through that chapter chapter three he says this is a truth saying if a man desire the the office of a bishop he desires a good work [Music] Bishop then must be blameless the husband of one wife so you see a bishop or a pastor cannot have more than one wife must have one wife Vigilant sober of good behavior given to hospitality able to teach not given to Wine Not Striker not greedy or filthy lacker but patient not a Brer not [Music] cous one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection with all gravity and then he says if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God and so he's a Deon also and so he's a Deon same thingification you see it says if a man does not know how to rule his own house if he does not know how to put his house in order how can he take care of the Church of the Liv he even says in some other place if a man cannot you know take care of his home is worse than unid meaning he not a Believer so you see it's not only for a Believer for a Preacher Brother for every brother every man you must be able to take care of your family must love them you must be able to cherish them and and and so that's the same way God God is our father amen he takes us as priority and he wants to take care of us he wants to nourish us he loves us beyond anything else he loves us even more than angels He Loves Us more than Heaven he left heaven and he came down to the Earth could he do that if heaven was more important to him than us you are more important to God is more important to God all Angels combined when the Angels sinned just looked at them and he said you go never come back but when man sin God himself come down to redeem foreign man that shows you how important you are to God God loves family family to God is priority and that is why if your family is broken in any way God is more willing to help you put it together than you are willing praise God and and so you you men who are not married you women who are not yet married God is interested in you having family because God is a family man can you say Amen to that God is a family man God is not a bachelor God is not a bachelor God is a married man and I am his wife the church is his wife the Bible says he's the head and we the church are the body so God is a married man and he has children too we are his children oh Hallelujah hallu glory to God we are his wife we are his children he's our husband is our father is everything to us we are everything to him Hallelujah relationship what a connection and we have a goal our goal is to go and be with him the god of married is to go and be with a husband the the go that the church has is to go and be with the Lord oh our hearts are longing to be with the Lord goal our goal is not to be millionaires Al that is good our goal is not to to wear all the clothes in the world although that is good our goal is not to be to have Masters and phds and everything every education educational level although we should but our goal as the Church of Jesus Christ is the is the coming of the Lord they are seeking after it in Africa they are seeking after it in Africa they're seeking after it in America amen our sister when you you go and meet the Believers the other side you will find that they are seeking after that Amen in Canada they seeking after that in New Zealand they seeking after that all over the world the body of Jesus Christ has a longing to be with the Lord everything else comes next but first that grand reunion and this enti message the purpose of this message is to bring the bride into connection with the bridegroom for that go to be accomplished that girl cannot be accomplished under the denominational Doctrine it cannot be completed under Catholicism it can listen it can't be completed under [Applause] theology God had to send a prophet he said in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery the mystery what mystery not only the mystery of Christ but the mystery of the bridegroom and and the bride the mystery of that Union will be finished Hallelujah when you read the Bible from Genesis Revelation it's all about that relationship between Jesus and his church read Song of Solomon is all about that relationship read about the book of it's all about that relationship read Ruth same thing go to the New Testament the whole thing is talking about two people Jesus and you Jesus and I Hallelujah I cannot wait to be perfectly joined with him and Paul says I may not have fully been I may not have fully achieved that but I'm pressing I'm continuing on I am not going to give up I am not going to let go I'm going to continue blessing until I'm fully United with him Hallelujah let us not let anything us or discourage us we must be fully United with him we must amen the Church must become one with the Lord Jesus nothing can stop it amen Paul said what can separate me from the love of Jesus the Bible is all about love if you want or you love a love story this is a love story it's between you and Jesus is between me and Jesus this is a love letter and that's why sent a prophet the way people who are in love they send Messengers to go and say and take a letter oh take this letter to that girl just don't make sure you don't open it tell her I love her and then he brings that letter this one is just a messenger but the the real thing is about him and her those are in love those are coming into unity and in the same way when God sends a messenger the messenger is only a messenger with a letter his message is a letter and we have received a letter amen invting us with Jesus Christ whenever we read in the message whenever we hear the message what do we see we see more about ourselves and we see more about him it is a two way you know when when when when you are writing writing a letter to your love oh these days it is WhatsApp those on of this generation you are missing out oh my God you're really missing out but for us we we do not have WhatsApp were using letters Hallelujah I remember that letter I wrote you know to Rea before we got married are still you know you know jumpy jumpy looking at one another in a distance and then I you know I had to get a very clean paper and I had to you know make sure I you know it will depict my heart properly and I had to get a very good pen and I started writing my dear heart and and you know I started Contin I continued I remember some of those words even today so I remember what I put in there I was speaking about myself but first spoke about her how you know she hits my eyes how I love her you know it was a two thing you know I would tell her about what I I see about her I praise her you know I I show her how much I'm affectionate towards her I tell her what is in my mind about her I tell her and I ask her questions about her and then I tell her about myself and then I tell her things about her it is a sweet thing friend and because of that we were married in March 2 on March 23rd 2013 and we have been married since and the love story is continuing to be sweet and Sweet and I mean it sweeter and sweeter and sweeter now my daughter is going to go back home and she will tell me Daddy you say sweeter and sweeter and sweeter and that's the truth but do you know what Jesus is the same way it's the same way whenever you open the pages of the word of God tells you about yourself even things you did not know about yourself you find them there and then it begins to tell you about himself he reveals himself to you and then he reveals you to yourself this is what this enti message is is a revelation of Jesus Christ and his bride hallelujah hallelujah thank God for this message that is why we must not allow anything to deter us to stop us to make us lose our Ze we must not let anything come in the way nothing should come in the way of this Union we must be United with him we must love him no matter what if you want to know that love is powerful come between two people who who are loving each other you will know that love is a powerful thing and I want to tell you the same thing Jesus loves you and let the devil try to come in between he will know that this C that binds us with Christ is so unbreakable is so powerful it cannot be measured with anything else oh do you love Jesus do you love Jesus whether you poor you will love him whether you are you don't have what you need you will love him because you know he cares about you and you know he would provide for you and you know he's fixing something something for you Hallelujah hallu I remember one time my wife was telling me about what she was going through and I told her don't you worry soon you'll be my wife and I will bring you to my home and my home will be your home and you'll do whatever you want hallelujah hallelujah the same thing Jesus has told us and he telling us today don't you worry about what you are going through soon and very soon I'm going to come and take you to my home and my home will be your home and your joy shall be full PR all press on don't let anything you from achieving that goal Hallelujah the devil will not stop us friends we must be focused on God we must be focused on the calling which we have received praise God brother I hope you don't get to miss things here now oh my listen we are going going to verse eight but more than that so he's saying it's not only it's not only for the sake of Christ and the purpose for which he has given my life more than more than that I count everything as [Music] loss compared to the Priceless privilege a privilege that is priceless what is a privilege is it what about a blessing find a better word very soon okay I count everything as loss compared to the Priceless privilege mhm and supreme advantage of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord there is you cannot be the same like those people who don't know Christ you are at an advantage you are higher than them we are not like them right now when everybody says oh the economy is not doing well you should be at a place that you are at an advantage at an advantage if you are not then you can be today by faith you are at an advantage of knowing Christ Jesus and growing more deeply and thoroughly acquainted with him a joy unequal for his sake I have lost everything and I consider it all garbage so that I may gain Christ and may be found in him believing and relying on him [Music] not having any righteousness of my own derived from my obedience to the [Music] law and its rituals but possessing that genuine righteousness which comes through faith in Christ Jesus listen friends your righteousness should be genuine it should not be coming from OB obeying the law it should come from the faith in Christ your righteousness should be on the basis of Faith what did Abraham do Abraham believed God and was counted to him for righte what did my wife do my wife believed everything I told her and I counted her worthy for my being my wife so in the same way Jesus Christ wants to count us worthy not because we have done not on the basis of our good works which we have done but on the B of believing on everything has are you hearing me and this so that I may know him experientially becoming more thoroughly acquainted with him understanding the remarkable wonders of his person understanding all the Wonders about himely and in that same way experience the power of his resurrection oh hallelujah hallelujah there is a power in his resurrection that we as his church need to experience how do we experience that power by Oh Glory to God he rose again from the day how many beli say amen he rose again from the dead the devil canot the devil believes that and the Devil Knows It But the devil has never experienced that power that Rose him up from the dead but the church must experience the power of his resurrection whereby things that are wrong in our can be totally changed Hallelujah you may not have arrived but I'm telling you your press on you have to reach that place where you have to experience the power of his resurrection whereby you can stand and say this has changed that has changed that has changed this one I'm still struggling but I am not giving up I am not giving up like the other one went and the other one went even this one must go I must reach that place where I must say I have experiened the power of his resurrection oh hallelujah hallelujah which overflows and is active in Believers the power of his resurrection praise God which overflows and is active in Believers that I may share the fellowship of his sufferings by being continually conformed inwardly in his likeness even even to his death dying as he did so we must also experience that the fellowship of his sufferings that does not mean suffering no it means we must experience we must we must okay I'm going to explain way you will understand understand it we must experience we must be in fellowship with his suffering what was the climax of his suffering it was death are you following me now you do not have to be beat like he was bitten because he was beaten the B says by by his stripes you are healed out of his stripes we receive healing but we have to be in fellowship with his suffering can only be attained by the death that he went through because he died you have to die AP Paul says I Die daily we have to Die daily we have to die to our lust we have to die to the flesh we have to die in our minds completely die and rot and then we can aen resurrect amen praise God not that I have already obtained it this goal of being Christlike all have already been made perfect Paul is saying I've not already obtained this go of being totally like Christ not that I have already been made perfect but I actively press I actively press on so that I may take hold of that Perfection for which Christ Jesus Took hold of me and made me his own brothers and sister I do not consider that I have made it on my own yet but one thing I do I am forgetting what lies behind and I am reaching forward to what lies ahead Hallelujah Paul is showing us here how to overcome Paul is showing us here how to press on how do you press on not by saying I'm perfect now you are not going to be perfect in one day but I told you one time here you are you are you know um um what is this word that I we used last time who remembers that word like a priz yes a trophy of his grace I'm not saying oh yes I've already attained it I'm perfect I am I'm here all the demons we always want to say all the demons are under me yeah but Paul is saying I'm saying that in reality it is not what is here but showing is showing us how to attain it before I continue here I'm showing you that we a trophy of his grace you know a trophy is attained only after Victory the one who runs the race or the one who fights the battle is the one who gets the trophy later on and when he gets the trophy the trophy shows he's Victorious are you following me no one can debate with him when David went when David when Saul told David to go and kill the the Philistines and that whoever does that I don't know how many heads did he want was it 100 he said when you do that when you kill them you can take my wife my daughter rather I'll give you my daughter he thought that David would be able to do it but David was a type of Christ David went and he fought with those people and he killed them and he cut off their head put it in the socks and cuted it trophies of his victory and he brought it over to the king he says open and see the man couldn't add any more said my daughter is there you can Jesus Christ oh hallelujah hallelujah in the same way he came down here on Earth he took the devil and he finished him he finished him I said he finished him when he was on the cross he said it is finished hallelujah hallelujah and what was the what proved that he is finished because when he finished the devil we are the ones that he had to show for R you did not get it yet we are the ones that he has to show for it because if he not come if they had not died we would have still been in sin actually we would have died but he died in our state so which devil did he defeat he defeated death and after he defeated death he came to us hallelujah and he pointed to us and he said you are the reason you are the proof that I'm a Victor because you are still alive it shows I'm a Victor because you are still alive shows I'm a conqueror and I'm telling you we are not dying anytime soon because Jesus died in our St he died that we might have life he died that we might be victorious therefore whether devil likes it or not we must come into Perfection Perfection must come if we can't come there it will come to us but I must be perfected I must be in the image of Christ the flesh Must Die my desires Must Die My Mind Must Die Christ must be bor in me and he says Press On you may not have attained it but it shows you how to press praise God he says actively press on that you will take even if you have not it says listen I'll read here not I have have obtained this goal but I press on toward the goal to win the Heavenly prize [Music] of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus and how do you press on he says by forgetting those things which are behind the first thing you must do Church some of you listen listen some of you are still living defeated life depends which area of your life it may be your financial life some of you may be struggling to get married others you may be starting to get jobs others you struggling with this and that breakthrough in your home now let me tell you some of these struggles are because of one reason that we don't put the past behind us when you come to Jesus Christ none of what you did none of what you did if it repented none of it matters he doesn't even remember I wish I did not do this and that and that and you know because now I see people are good but for me I I know myself I'm one of the worst and that's the reason why you are still defeated you need to take that all that you know and put it behind you Paul said I take he says I consider I cons he says listen brothers and sisters he I do not consider that I have made it on my own yet one thing I do tell your neighbor one thing I do forgetting what lies behind forgetting what lies behind slap your neighbor and tell them forget tell them forget again forget brother forget sister whatever pain you have gone through forget whatever suffering you have gone through forget sister you were just St recently forget forget every pain forget every suffering forget all the disappointment forget all the heart breaks forget everything you have gone through in the name of Jesus Christ forget it all forget your sin forget your bad life forget your bad thought put it behind you now get ready to reach for what is ahead of you he says I forget what lies behind and I'm Reaching Forward to what lies [Applause] ahead there is much more ahead I said there is much more ahead God has prepared for us things we can't see now things we can't feel now my my my my I'm having a good time up here oh my don't you feel it Hallelujah God has prepared for us great things do you believe it God has prepared for you God has prepared for you God has prepared for each and every one of you great things even to you that is streaming God has prepared for you Hallelujah great things the Bible says you don't even know what it is you have no idea about it but I can tell you this great it is mighty just press forward press on press on no matter what brought you down matter your bad feelings in the past oh press on and he said I I go forward I'm reaching I am reaching forward to what lies behind my my my you know Reaching Forward you know when something is ahead of you you are Reaching Forward to catch it but you've not yet caught it but you're about to catch it I want to say brother Solomon what is that that you want to C praise God take it from my preaching I'm no longer preaching now is speaking to you you either receive it or not you either receive it or not I I want people who shall receive people who shall catch T Hallelujah this is the real Pentecost real Pentecost are people of the spirit they believe what the Holy Ghost can do they believe what God can do not what the devil has done reach forward to it reach and catch it reach and catch it take your hand out and catch it and catch it and catch it hallelujah hallelujah oh my I can F in my spirit God is doing something in our generation in our lives no matter what the devil has done in our amen I'm reaching forward to God prepared for me there must be something there must be something he did not send me a love letter intending to leave me here in no no no no he must be preparing he must be preparing to come down here and take me out hallu Hallelujah Rea was there and each time she was waiting for me each time she was waiting for me I was very busy preparing for her I was also very busy preparing for her I was thinking about her and because I was busy preparing for her I didn't call her that much but guess what she would call me she would call me and say what is happening you are quiet and I say oh yes I'm preparing for you to come that's why the bride should not be quiet we should pray we should fast we should come in his presence we say hey Jesus what is happening on this Cas what is happening about this and then he will tell us when we call on him he will answer when we pray he will talk to us but if we don't he will be quiet that's why a Believer must be in touch with him when you are walking be in touch with him when you're at home being touch with him when you wherever you are pray talk to him connect with him have something time alone with God In Prayer recognizing praying to him speaking to him Lord what about this what about and he will speak back to you if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and I will hear them from heaven and I will answer oh hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah oh sister are you enjoying that do you believe that my my my my my Hallelujah I said we have a god amen we have a go to be like Christ to go in the Rapture to finally get to go and meet him in the Rapture to leave as Overcomers in this world we must not settle for anything less listen listen if you have not overcome some things for example we are in Africa we in Uganda we have a common problem lack of resources lack of money you know people and but before I talk about that I'll tell you this many times when people get money they go away from God many times it is seen when people get money they go out from God is one of the richest Generations but he see they have done too little for God and so the more resources people get the more they forget God sometimes they think it is a good thing to be poor but I don't want to be poor because when I get money I will use it to serve God what about you will you serve God If He blesses you you are quiet only a few of you saying amen do you fear money some of you fear money let me tell you in Africa here some people fear you give someone 50,000 some of them may not sleep let us be realistic sister if I gave you 50 million today will you sleep you said the truth some of you can't sleep you decide to be you decide to be a guard on your house to make sure that no one comes to steal your money some of you when you have 20,000 you put it in your pocket and you keep touching there to make sure it is there and you want God to give you 1 million you must have big Faith big Faith doesn't look to small things you must big faith will show you a vision of what God wants you to be our your vision will not be money your vision will not be money my vision I want to get this much money your vision will be what you want to accomplish your go what is your goal God looks at that God looks at that I see people believers who are very rich believers who are very rich you see they have done so much for God which means God God saw their goal and he blessed them so if you are here and you want to be blessed financially first I'm giving you now a clue first check your objective your motive your desire your goal if you see this not Christ you are not among those ones that God is about to bless financially not you are not among them until your vision is aligned with that of God now if you you check yourself and you noce your objective your goal your motive what is it oh we are preaching that our goal is is to go in the Rapture our go is Ser to do things for God everything else doesn't matter that is our goal it should consume us whatever we do should be under that but our main goal is that if God sees that that is your go oh take me at my words tonight God wants to bless you financially and he will the devil can't stop it he wants us to leave as Overcomers we are we have the god the god of Abraham Abraham was not a poor manob was not a poor man oh yes oh yes oh praise God praise God oh sister Esther this is the time when God gives you a word now you see if your objective and your goal and your vision is aligned properly whatever they stole from you is peanuts compared to what God is preparing for you just get ready you remember that woman who you know the prophet told go and bring whatever you can bring bring elishah was the prophet and the prophet of God told that woman come on now he said go and fish whatever you can find and know she was poor she didn't have enough when she went out she borrowed as much as she to her strength and whatever she brought the prophet of God filled with o told her now go and S where did that business come from from God that's what God is going to do for you praise God hallelujah hallu you can think about me what you want to think about me but I believe when God speaks he has to accomplish what [Music] hallelujah hallelujah God wants us to be Overcomers not defeated to take he wants to you know to take our our place he wants us to take our place Sons and Daughters of God and live above the world he doesn't want us to live in sin so if you're living in sin listen to me God is Will for you to live above that se so don't focus on that put it behind you look forward there's something there you can catch it by no matter what comes before us if we know our go we will not give up right we will keep pressing on we will settle we will not settle for less brother Edson we will not set for we will not do I have someone here who will repeat with me will not setle for Less we will not setle for Less our goal is the rapture we need to know we canot go there alone the very last one must come in first whatever we do whatever we do we be further that goal of the Rapture if we are collecting money for the church to buy land and to build the church it is to further the Rapture to help the Rapture come quickly right if you're going for missionary work it is for that go if we preparing youth meetings what is the goal what is the purpose to F the Rapture because the young people come in they will be prepared by the ministry which will come they preure them with without the Holy Ghost They will receive the Holy Ghost amen those who need God to move in their lives a certain way God will move for what God to father to bring about the Rapture if we are printing books and distributing drugs you've done that andon Solomon and you done that for what go to end for the Rapture for the that is our goal that I said that is our goal that's why we intentionally do certain things in a certain way that's why we get we Mar our young people when so that we don't want them to concentrate on the body feelings and this that is nothing for the world we want them to focus on the Rapture to focus on the go if if you are married you become more stable I remember my brother here who is also my son in the Lord he was beginning to go sideway and I was praying for him oh God oh God give him a wifee him and now he's becoming stable because of a family God is a family man in your mind is a young person think about settling down in that area of your life and then you focus on the go praise God praise God that's why I come to church that is why we believe in working we encourage working not being because if you lazy you don't you cannot focus on the God everything that we do it should help us to keep straight our eyes straight on the ground are you hearing me now our Prophet says this I've often wondered what does christians want to frustrate themselves with the things anyhow men and women comes to me many times and says in their confessions and so forth when I have I have those in private interviews and they meet me and move make confessions of living immoral and all kinds because they can't deny the holy spirit is right there and if they cover if they have to cover it up it brings it right out for them so they might as well tell it if they get to try get out the Holy Spirit stops them say just a minute here is certain thing and certain thing and and that has happened Even in our church here where people would try to deny things and the Holy Spirit Will point it out so when they come they begin to tell me about the things of the world and I notice it is amongest Believers you are going somewhere what are you drifting for get some ambition about you set your goal on Christ and quit with the world Amen that is our goal we should set our goal on Christ and we should quit telling with the world here and there and there and you must test your motive and objective and find the will of God and then find your objective and then test your motive and see if your motive is right and then as Jesus said in Mark 11 say to this mountain that is if your objective is right your motive is right and if you s to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but as long as you got that in the heart whether it's the will of God or not or your motive or objective is wrong how is it going to move and your objective is right but when you know what your motive is right and it's the will of God and your objective is right it has got are you hearing oh God I I want to contribute to the church land fund God will ask you how much I bless you how much will you give uh 1 million and then God will bless you with 500,000 because he knows even if he gives you 50 million you will not give the one million first of all you limited God you very well know we need about 300 million and then you you are saying God I'll give 1 million what is your motive so if if you promise God 1 million in church land fund and he gives you 50 where 50 million where will you put the 49 it is even likely you may not TI you a lot of money I'm challenging you tonight I'm teaching you how to be blessed but if you want God to bless you don't just say it on your heart on your mouth minute in your heart pray about it your motive is right your objective is right oh God if you bless me I'm sure going to give a substantive amount towards the the the the church project of building the church I'm going to send I'm going to send missionaries into the field I'm going to do this for your work if God sees that heart he would say even if you've not prayed that much but he is the motive the objective he'll bless you with the money and then someone who has been fasting and praying for days and nights is not fair I prayed a lot I fasted a lot the question is what is your motive objective what is your goal many times we put our goal down to the things of the earth we think about ourselves our belly our family our this but we take God last the ex that many Believers don't even pay time so then how can God bless you how can he open his windows if your motive and objective is not to F his kingdom but here he tells us this is the prophet of God speaking this he says if your objective is right and your motive is right then don't doubt just tell that mountain mountain removed he says it will move it will move it will move are those my words now are those my words of the Prophet it will move the mountain will move tell your neighbor the mountain will the mountain will move upon your feet with me tonight the mountain must move the mountain will move and if it doesn't move you know what to do press on press on towards the go and the mountain must move if your motive and objective is Right hallelujah hallelujah praise God God wants to bless us God wants to to to to lift us to those rooms of of Faith where things things that are impossible are made possible but we must believe him our objective should be right brother Peter if you can do that song Set Your Wings on the wings do you know the song Set Your Wings on our wings of [Music] faith
