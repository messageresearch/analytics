[1:03:37] now
[1:03:38] my ministry
[1:03:40] where does that work conditions of it
[1:03:53] and i know this is on record because we
[1:03:55] are streaming our services and it will
[1:03:56] be listened to many many years after a
[1:03:58] ranch manager
[1:04:06] because it is a wonderful testimonial
[1:04:10] so that is much
[1:04:29] about 16 16 17 years ago i don't
[1:04:32] remember exactly
[1:04:38] also
[1:04:39] gave me a chance
[1:04:41] to start ministering in his church
[1:04:48] you know
[1:04:49] i know there are many young people we
[1:04:50] have in this church
[1:04:53] but we know that there are many churches
[1:04:56] that when a young person feels oh i have
[1:04:59] a call upon my life
[1:05:04] you see the young the all the ministers
[1:05:07] tell them
[1:05:10] and while i was speaking that i remember
[1:05:12] there's another minister who said
[1:05:13] exactly what i'm going to say brother
[1:05:15] so he said many of them said
[1:06:17] to the leadership of the holy spirit
[1:06:23] is that god wants to use them
[1:06:27] and so because of that
[1:06:29] i have in my heart and i've had for
[1:06:31] years
[1:06:35] respect for him as a man
[1:06:39] because because of him
[1:06:42] i started running
[1:07:10] [Music]
