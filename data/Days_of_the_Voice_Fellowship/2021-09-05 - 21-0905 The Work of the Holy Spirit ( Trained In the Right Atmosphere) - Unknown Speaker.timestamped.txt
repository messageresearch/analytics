[1:34:27] in christ jesus
[1:34:34] you know who a school master is a
[1:34:36] teacher
[1:34:38] someone who trains you up
[1:34:40] someone who tells you what to do
[1:34:43] someone who tells you what not to do

[1:34:48] someone who prepares you
[1:34:52] someone who rebukes you
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:54] are you following me
[1:34:56] all this is the work of a teacher
[1:35:01] but now we realize
[1:35:03] when all this is the work of the holy
[1:35:05] spirit
[1:35:08] the holy spirit is supposed to teach you
[1:35:11] the holy spirit is supposed to guide you
[1:35:14] the holy spirit is to show you things to
[1:35:16] come
[1:35:17] again
[1:35:18] to protect you
[1:35:22] but before you receive the holy ghost
[1:35:25] that is the work of the school master
[1:35:35] [Music]
[1:35:54] [Music]
[1:36:22] i
[1:36:36] is for you to be
[1:37:08] people who usually have a problem with
[1:37:10] preachers or what the bible says is are
[1:37:12] those people who do not have the holy
[1:37:14] spirit
[1:37:32] that's why if someone is doing something
[1:37:34] wrong
[1:37:38] and it's corrected
[1:37:40] if he has the true holy spirit
[1:37:44] oh he will humble himself
[1:38:05] children do not have choices before the
[1:38:07] age of accountability
[1:38:21] [Music]
[1:38:41] that child cannot even be taken to to
[1:38:44] caught alone
[1:38:47] because they have not reached the age of
[1:38:49] accountability
[1:38:52] they have choices
[1:38:53] by the virtue of the fact that they are
[1:38:54] human beings
[1:38:57] [Music]
[1:39:38] that power now that you get identified
[1:39:42] oppressed
[1:39:45] actually when i preached on that summon
[1:39:46] the power of female agencies

[1:42:06] now let me tell you something
[1:42:07] [Applause]
[1:42:10] god is going to hold you responsible
[1:42:46] because the parents have decided not to
[1:42:48] take over the responsibility that god
[1:42:50] has given to them
[1:43:09] [Music]
[1:43:18] and the husband is the king of his home
[1:43:35] that man must have his house his family
[1:43:39] under subjection
[1:43:45] he must be able to control his house
[1:43:50] he must be able to control
[1:43:56] [Music]
[1:44:04] oh
[1:44:16] [Applause]
[1:44:18] father
[1:44:19] nothing the way a man has control over
[1:44:22] the house mom who said there were a

[1:44:59] if someone is doing something wrong
[1:45:28] you know
[1:45:41] is
[1:45:56] so they can love
[1:46:17] [Music]
[1:46:25] and some preachers will tell you that
[1:46:27] they are telling you to do things
[1:46:28] because they are led by the spirit
[1:46:31] of faith
[1:46:34] and they don't find what they are
[1:46:35] telling you to do in the bible
[1:46:38] run away
[1:46:50] you know telling women to leave their
[1:46:52] husbands to marry another one
[1:46:56] those are the ones you know you know you
[1:46:59] know bringing divorces
[1:47:02] those are the ones telling you to you
[1:47:04] know bring a gallons of oil they just
[1:47:05] power power power on you

[1:48:58] you position
[1:49:20] hallelujah amen the choices before the
[1:49:22] holy spirit are all that the children
[1:49:24] america always come out

[1:50:11] [Music]
[1:50:19] [Music]

[1:50:35] because if they make choices
[1:50:38] before they receive the holy spirit
[1:50:41] when they are still young
[1:50:43] you know they will make them according
[1:50:45] to the last of the flesh

[1:51:55] christ is a gentleman christo
[1:52:00] they would be there baby down asking him
[1:52:03] who do you think you are where is that

[1:52:33] who was jesus christ yes he was god
[1:52:35] himself yes
[1:52:38] yes
[1:52:40] but the bible says
[1:52:54] he accepted to go on the cross
[1:53:09] almost naked
[1:53:23] ashamed of him never quite when so it's
[1:53:26] hard to put off the lights
[1:53:31] the moon shut down and you always watch
[1:53:33] the sun shut down
[1:53:36] shut down
[1:53:37] we cannot see

[1:56:10] president that we ever had in this
[1:56:11] nation in the usa he says was abraham
[1:56:14] lincolnin
[1:56:19] [Music]

[2:50:55] the blessings of the holy ghost
[2:50:58] the blessings of the holy ghost
[2:51:00] no
[2:51:02] that is for the whole congregation
[2:51:04] but the hidden manner name man was a
[2:51:07] special revelation
[2:51:10] because he had to teach the others
[2:51:15] was a little more knowledge of the
[2:51:16] scripture
[2:51:20] that he would teach others
[2:51:23] that is the man of god or the pastor
[2:51:26] hey hey
[2:51:27] man
[2:51:58] you will never leave no higher than your
[2:52:00] pastor
[2:52:03] you remember that hey
[2:52:06] now let's pause right there
[2:52:09] many people have
[2:52:10] read this about
[2:52:28] [Music]
[2:52:51] no
[2:52:52] sheep can claim to be higher than the
[2:53:06] and that is what is happening with the
[2:53:08] denomination
[2:53:11] now what does the prophet mean here
[2:53:13] together
[2:53:14] even in the message
[2:53:17] god blesses your pastor of that special
[2:53:18] revelation
[2:53:22] to be able to bless you
[2:53:25] now you can't go above it
[2:53:29] now
[2:53:30] if your pastor
[2:53:35] is not having it
[2:53:56] yes in our church there is women and
[2:53:58] preachers our pastors but it's okay for
[2:54:00] me i don't believe it
[2:54:05] them but i don't believe it next she
[2:54:07] kills them it's not right
[2:54:08] it is up to the church
[2:54:11] my dear quran you cannot be higher than
[2:54:13] that
[2:54:16] if your leaders are going to hell you
[2:54:17] are going to help too i couldn't
[2:54:38] [Laughter]
[2:54:41] so if
[2:54:43] if you call me on the rapture morning
[2:54:44] and i'm still here just know we are all
[2:54:46] doomed
[2:54:54] [Laughter]
[2:55:00] oh
[2:55:28] hallelujah
[2:55:35] [Music]
[2:55:43] calling me doing those things
[2:55:45] just now you're finished
[2:55:47] because you are going to be not higher
[2:55:49] than what is telling you
[2:55:51] [Music]

[2:55:56] church edge
[2:56:10] of the power of god will follow
[2:56:16] hallelujah amen
[2:56:18] i believe
[2:56:19] if we are the true church of god
[2:56:23] there must be true manifestations in our
[2:56:25] meetings
[2:56:28] and i'm not talking only about times
[2:56:32] that is good
[2:56:33] it must be there there's no power it
[2:56:35] must be there is nobody if they are not
[2:56:37] there
[2:56:38] it's a clear sign there
[2:56:49] himself in our lives
[2:56:57] [Music]
[2:57:07] you must be in a position whereby you
[2:57:09] can say last year i was like this but
[2:57:11] this year i'm not like this

[2:57:34] i can't help them chica can see that
[2:57:36] there are similar queens
[2:57:39] because
[2:57:40] i believe
[2:57:42] this message will preach overcome number
[2:57:44] two if i'm i'm if
[2:57:46] i'm the right person god has sent to you
[2:57:48] when
[2:57:53] [Music]
[2:58:10] you might be stunted and you don't know
[2:58:13] but i thank god
[2:58:15] that we are progressing

[2:58:44] that no smile nothing but you know
[2:58:47] something happened all of a sudden
[2:58:53] and it's just one example
[2:58:56] yesterday

[3:02:02] and there are many other young men who
[3:02:03] have been a part of our bible study

[3:02:44] been a part of it yet but i've
[3:02:46] been given a testimony now for now
