[1:03:43] week and after th Wednesday it will be
[1:03:47] the
[1:03:53] convention amen amen
[1:03:57] so this morning I'm speaking to you
[1:04:00] on that which we
[1:04:02] read let us just rehear it a bit to
[1:04:04] remind
[1:04:08] ourselves and Moses answered and said
[1:04:10] but behold they will not believe me nor
[1:04:14] hecken unto my voice for they will say
[1:04:17] the Lord has not appeared unto thee
[1:04:28] and the Lord said unto him what is that
[1:04:31] in th
[1:04:34] hand so many of you who know the
[1:04:37] story uh this is when uh God had come
[1:04:40] down to call
[1:04:43] Moses Moses had spent 40
[1:04:47] years under the training in of um the
[1:04:51] Palace of
[1:04:54] pharaoh and he was being trained to
[1:04:56] become or the next fellow
[1:04:59] we and for 40 years he had tried his
[1:05:04] best to learn his
[1:05:06] best to be his best to fulfill his
[1:05:10] life's
[1:05:11] Ambitions his mother raised him up
[1:05:13] telling
[1:05:14] him that you are born for a purpose you
[1:05:18] are going to serve our
[1:05:19] people and so Moses grew up knowing very
[1:05:23] well that he was going to his
[1:05:26] people but time
[1:05:28] came when Moses became of age and then
[1:05:33] he went back to the Palace of pharaoh
[1:05:37] but the Bible then would also
[1:05:39] say he
[1:05:42] esteemed um uh the reproach he decided
[1:05:45] to leave all the goodness and everything
[1:05:47] that was in the
[1:05:52] palace and he decided to identify
[1:05:54] himself with his
[1:05:58] people his people the uh the the
[1:06:02] Israelites course they were living in
[1:06:05] Gan and U and they were like
[1:06:08] slaves and he was up here in a good
[1:06:12] life but he decided instead of
[1:06:15] identifying himself with
[1:06:17] pharaoh and the Egyptians he decided to
[1:06:20] identify himself with the outcast
[1:06:26] thees because he realized he was one of
[1:06:30] them are you following
[1:06:32] me so now Moses reached a
[1:06:36] time and
[1:06:38] um he you know went away from the
[1:06:42] palace and one day he's out there in the
[1:06:45] in in the in the
[1:06:49] field and um you know one of the
[1:06:53] Egyptians was um beating the
[1:06:56] the
[1:06:59] israelit and trying to make him
[1:07:01] work and when Moses saw that he felt so
[1:07:07] bad he felt so bad he said this is one
[1:07:09] of my
[1:07:10] own how come that this
[1:07:15] man you know beat him
[1:07:17] up so he took matters in his own
[1:07:21] hands and he went and squeezed this man
[1:07:25] squeezed him because of
[1:07:28] love for for his people and the calling
[1:07:32] upon his
[1:07:34] life do you know you can actually be
[1:07:36] called by
[1:07:37] God and you have responded to that
[1:07:40] call but
[1:07:43] mentally you have answered the call in
[1:07:47] your mind but not in your
[1:07:51] heart you cannot respond to that call in
[1:07:54] your heart
[1:07:56] before you meet
[1:07:58] God each of us has to meet
[1:08:01] God are you hearing me Church each of us
[1:08:05] has to have a personal experience with
[1:08:09] God there's one thing that you hear the
[1:08:11] preacher
[1:08:13] tell and you you know you read and you
[1:08:17] know and you know someone you know
[1:08:19] people would come and tell me I know
[1:08:22] everything listen Church it is not about
[1:08:25] knowing
[1:08:26] everything did you know the devil knows
[1:08:28] more than
[1:08:30] you tell your neighbor the devil knows
[1:08:32] more than
[1:08:34] you can you imagine that the Bible says
[1:08:38] we believe in one
[1:08:40] God the devil also believes and he
[1:08:43] doesn't even only believe but he also
[1:08:45] trembles
[1:08:47] after so he believes the devil believes
[1:08:50] everything you believe the devil knows
[1:08:53] everything you know
[1:08:55] more he was in the presence of God in
[1:08:59] heaven more than any of
[1:09:01] us none of us has been so much in his
[1:09:05] presence more than
[1:09:09] the think about
[1:09:11] that the devil is more
[1:09:14] experienced in the presence of
[1:09:17] God more than any professing
[1:09:21] believer but even with that he was not
[1:09:24] changed
[1:09:29] he knows so much but he was not
[1:09:32] Chang if the devil had a
[1:09:34] heart his heart was far from
[1:09:37] God but one thing about demons and
[1:09:40] devil they don't they can't
[1:09:45] repent and they can't be forgiven even
[1:09:48] even if they
[1:09:50] did that the Bible says when they fell
[1:09:53] from their first estate
[1:09:57] fail once
[1:09:58] forever they cannot be
[1:10:01] redeemed but human being we are not
[1:10:04] meant to
[1:10:06] fall and remain Fallen human beings have
[1:10:13] souls and there are human
[1:10:15] beings who were in the mind of
[1:10:18] God before the foundation of the
[1:10:22] world those even when they fall
[1:10:26] they cannot remain
[1:10:29] Fallen because within them is a seed
[1:10:34] which can never
[1:10:37] die this the people that I'm talking
[1:10:40] about you know even God himself cannot
[1:10:44] leave them to
[1:10:46] perish those are the ones he died
[1:10:49] for because he knew there was no other
[1:10:53] way for them to be saved
[1:10:56] without his
[1:10:58] action if you think about yourself and
[1:11:01] you think about your life you can
[1:11:04] sincerely say without his death on the
[1:11:07] cross I would be lost I would be gone
[1:11:12] and I'm so glad that he died on the
[1:11:15] cross he made a way where there was no
[1:11:19] way he has given an
[1:11:21] entrance where there was a blocked
[1:11:23] entrance
[1:11:25] because after man had seen in
[1:11:28] the then he says put two
[1:11:31] Cher to watch The Way of the tree of
[1:11:34] life the way was blocked the way was
[1:11:39] blocked but there come a man and his
[1:11:43] name is Jesus he said I am the
[1:11:46] way amen anybody who comes to me amen
[1:11:50] can go to the
[1:11:51] father so in other words the way is
[1:11:54] Jesus
[1:11:56] the way is the word the more of the word
[1:11:59] you get
[1:12:00] in the more of the word is revealed to
[1:12:04] you in your heart amen an
[1:12:08] entrance is being ministered to you and
[1:12:12] the day you have an
[1:12:14] encounter with the Holy Spirit and you
[1:12:18] are filled with the power of the Holy
[1:12:21] Spirit you have permanent access
[1:12:29] are you following me
[1:12:30] now
[1:12:34] okay I have a lot to speak so I and I
[1:12:37] don't want to be long because I'm tired
[1:12:39] and you some of you are
[1:12:42] tired so you pray for me that we will
[1:12:45] just share something small but something
[1:12:49] edified how many are praying for
[1:12:51] me all right by the way let me let me
[1:12:55] teach
[1:12:56] this because sometimes you hear
[1:12:58] preachers talking about
[1:12:59] that he's preaching and he's saying are
[1:13:02] you
[1:13:04] praying so why is does he want me to
[1:13:07] pray right
[1:13:08] now
[1:13:09] yes let me teach you
[1:13:12] Dev whenever the word is
[1:13:14] going listen to it
[1:13:18] prayerfully don't that's why some of you
[1:13:20] does because your spirit is
[1:13:24] sleeping you should not sleep when you
[1:13:27] are hearing the word so when you're
[1:13:29] hearing the word don't just
[1:13:30] hear and in your spirit you're thinking
[1:13:32] about
[1:13:33] other open all
[1:13:36] channels open all all all you know
[1:13:40] preach the inside of the
[1:13:43] inside you know the doors in a
[1:13:46] door open all the doors of
[1:13:49] your so when a preacher is preaching in
[1:13:52] prayer oh God speak to me God him God
[1:13:56] Inspire him and and then your prayer
[1:13:59] will begin to
[1:14:00] change as God is begin to
[1:14:02] minister and then you begin to
[1:14:04] communicate with him directly say Lord I
[1:14:06] receive that Lord I receive that Lord
[1:14:09] may you put it upon my life may you
[1:14:12] practice that and you will watch what
[1:14:14] will happen in your
[1:14:16] life amen I believe in people praying
[1:14:19] while they're
[1:14:21] hear okay so we see here that
[1:14:26] Moses um um you know he had left his
[1:14:31] people the is the he had left the
[1:14:34] Egyptians brother and gone to his people
[1:14:38] and um and so they he tried to take
[1:14:41] matters in his own
[1:14:43] hand but he had never had an
[1:14:47] encounter with the Holy Spirit we have
[1:14:50] so many believers who have never had an
[1:14:52] encounter
[1:14:55] with the Holy
[1:14:57] Spirit and these have been the greatest
[1:15:02] hindrance to the
[1:15:05] gospel he's a Believer but he has never
[1:15:08] met the Holy
[1:15:10] Spirit he has never been
[1:15:12] baptized into the Holy
[1:15:14] Spirit he has never had an
[1:15:17] experience he doesn't know what it
[1:15:21] is he has even never cried in the spirit
[1:15:27] he has even never you know um prayed in
[1:15:31] the
[1:15:32] spirit he doesn't know spiritual
[1:15:35] things he's a spiritual
[1:15:38] baby may God not allow it for you to
[1:15:42] remain consistently a spiritual
[1:15:46] baby may you grow in the things of
[1:15:49] God may you grow deeper into the things
[1:15:53] of amen and so
[1:15:55] was a good man but Moses did not
[1:15:59] know what it is to be in the presence of
[1:16:04] God he had never had one
[1:16:07] encounter so he knew the word but he was
[1:16:11] exercising the word
[1:16:14] can and that's why he killed that
[1:16:17] man he killed him and buried him
[1:16:21] in and when one time one man told him
[1:16:25] don't you think I know what you
[1:16:27] did I will tell
[1:16:32] Pharaoh praise the name of the
[1:16:34] Lord praise the name of the
[1:16:37] lord it's a very good sign of someone
[1:16:40] who does not have the Holy
[1:16:43] Spirit you do things
[1:16:46] mechanically you do things
[1:16:48] manually and then you bu
[1:16:53] stuff why
[1:16:55] no Holy
[1:16:56] Spirit not
[1:16:58] converted not chained but a Believer
[1:17:02] that's Howes
[1:17:04] was in that
[1:17:06] state how many are like
[1:17:10] that I don't know how many like
[1:17:13] that like Moses a
[1:17:18] brother a
[1:17:19] Believer but Bing a lot
[1:17:23] of and is when no one
[1:17:27] realizes he's very okay but when they
[1:17:30] find out he's fearing for
[1:17:33] his and when he found out find someone
[1:17:40] knows the only thing he could think
[1:17:42] about was to run
[1:17:45] away and he
[1:17:46] R but the problem why many Believers are
[1:17:50] still
[1:17:51] running is because they don't have an
[1:17:54] encounter with
[1:17:57] they are not yet filled with the Holy
[1:17:59] Spirit you can't serve God
[1:18:01] anywhere there's nothing you are doing
[1:18:03] for the Lord you are running you are
[1:18:07] running why you are not even attending
[1:18:10] Services why because you are not filled
[1:18:14] with the holy spirit let me tell you
[1:18:16] when you receive the Holy
[1:18:18] Spirit you receive a thirst for the
[1:18:20] things of
[1:18:22] God you receive a hunger
[1:18:25] whereby you always want
[1:18:29] more always you want more
[1:18:31] of when others are saying the service
[1:18:34] was too
[1:18:35] long and so you are saying why did the
[1:18:37] pastor for a few
[1:18:38] minutes why because you want
[1:18:41] more is not your flesh pulling for it it
[1:18:45] is your soul pulling for it amen because
[1:18:48] a soul that is filled with the spirit of
[1:18:51] God desires for more of God
[1:18:56] amen you know that's how Moses was Moses
[1:19:01] was dry he did not have that
[1:19:06] encounter and so he ran and went away
[1:19:10] into the land of Midian and when he
[1:19:13] reached there he found a priest there
[1:19:16] and he married a
[1:19:18] woman of this priest of this
[1:19:21] priest and uh then
[1:19:25] you know I don't know how they
[1:19:28] discuss but eventually he also becomes a
[1:19:32] worker of his
[1:19:35] father-in-law and he was hiding his
[1:19:39] ship and so I don't know how he was
[1:19:41] being
[1:19:43] paid but that was the arrangement and he
[1:19:46] did it for a long
[1:19:49] time 40 good
[1:19:52] years 40 years had in the ship of
[1:19:57] his and one time Moses is
[1:20:01] working with his Ro in his hand and you
[1:20:05] know it's just just like any
[1:20:09] day it could be today like you are
[1:20:12] you've come to church like any day like
[1:20:16] any
[1:20:17] Sunday but may something happen to you
[1:20:20] today that like that what happened to
[1:20:23] Moses
[1:20:26] Moses was just
[1:20:28] walking just
[1:20:29] normally and with his sheep and the
[1:20:32] Bible says he saw a
[1:20:36] bush which was having some fire
[1:20:39] in
[1:20:41] burning so Moses was
[1:20:44] attracted so he walked towards that
[1:20:50] burning Moses a man who has hid his sins
[1:20:54] for more than 40
[1:20:57] years Moses a man who has thought is a
[1:21:01] failure for more than 40
[1:21:04] years Moses a man who thought he had run
[1:21:08] away from the purpose of his
[1:21:12] life he knew it very well he knew what
[1:21:16] God had called him to
[1:21:17] do but he was he knew he was running
[1:21:20] away because listen listen because he
[1:21:24] did not have
[1:21:32] know that God wants me to do this but I
[1:21:34] don't have the ability I don't have the
[1:21:37] anointing to fulfill that how many of
[1:21:40] you are like that
[1:21:42] tonight let me remove my court and I
[1:21:44] preach to you very well amen
[1:22:00] the who went to don't
[1:22:06] don't almost slept for one
[1:22:09] hour but I see others are
[1:22:14] very I don't want anybody to be
[1:22:24] feel sleep it means somebody near you is
[1:22:27] soon sleeping praise the name of the
[1:22:29] Lord hallelujah
[1:22:32] hallelujah that's 10% hallelujah
[1:22:35] hallelujah all right that's good
[1:22:37] now so now Moses came to this
[1:22:41] place and um when he s he saw this
[1:22:45] Burning
[1:22:46] Bush he
[1:22:48] realized that he he is a sinful man he
[1:22:52] had run away from the purpose of God for
[1:22:54] his
[1:22:56] he knew no way he could be able to
[1:22:58] accomplish
[1:22:59] it when he was young and stronger he
[1:23:03] thought himself
[1:23:05] powerful and he tried to do it with his
[1:23:07] own
[1:23:08] strength and then when he failed he
[1:23:11] decided to give up
[1:23:13] pefully and he ran away and he went and
[1:23:17] retired
[1:23:18] himself in a far
[1:23:21] land and he he even married a woman
[1:23:25] according to the word at that time he
[1:23:28] was not even supposed to
[1:23:30] marry so Moses was now
[1:23:33] weak Moses was old Moses was tired Moses
[1:23:38] had covered a lot of
[1:23:40] things he fear to go back in his
[1:23:43] past because there were many things in
[1:23:45] his past which were
[1:23:48] disorganized but you see as he approach
[1:23:51] this uh uh burning bush
[1:23:55] a voice came out of it and he said
[1:23:59] Moses approach no father remove your
[1:24:02] shoes for the ground you're standing on
[1:24:07] is Holy Ground you know that place where
[1:24:09] you meet
[1:24:11] God Amen that time when you meet
[1:24:15] God is a Holy
[1:24:18] Ground Hallelujah and when you meet God
[1:24:22] unveils everything about
[1:24:25] life he shows you all your
[1:24:28] weakness way did you know when you come
[1:24:30] before the presence of
[1:24:32] God he reveals everything about
[1:24:37] you what you thought no one
[1:24:40] knows God uncovers
[1:24:43] it that's why during the preaching many
[1:24:45] many
[1:24:46] times you know I've seen it many times
[1:24:50] there was one time we were in a
[1:24:52] convention you know and the word was
[1:24:55] preached and the the presence of God
[1:24:57] came
[1:24:58] down and you know someone
[1:25:00] ran ran like a Bo and came on the Altar
[1:25:06] and said pastor pray for me I am a Sina
[1:25:09] I am a back
[1:25:11] slider they began confessing
[1:25:14] things that I never knew I didn't know
[1:25:17] that person we had almost 1,200 people
[1:25:21] at the
[1:25:22] convention that person never met
[1:25:25] me but maybe saw me for the first time
[1:25:29] but what made them talk those things
[1:25:32] because of the presence of
[1:25:34] God and that person began
[1:25:37] vomiting a lot of stuff and I tell you
[1:25:41] he left that that that actually she was
[1:25:43] a lady she left that place when she was
[1:25:48] renewed amen and when when the presence
[1:25:51] of God comes down don't always hold your
[1:25:56] secrets God always hold your
[1:25:59] life amen accept to be
[1:26:04] naked in his
[1:26:06] presence so that he can take you and
[1:26:09] make something out of
[1:26:12] you I remember there was a time in the
[1:26:14] service
[1:26:16] here several time things have happened
[1:26:18] like and people begin to confess things
[1:26:22] well of course we meet them after the
[1:26:23] service
[1:26:25] be able to give them counseling and all
[1:26:27] that what I'm saying friends knowing god
[1:26:30] is one
[1:26:32] thing meeting God is
[1:26:35] another the problem we have in the
[1:26:38] message we have a lot of people who know
[1:26:43] God they know about him because they
[1:26:46] know baptis him in Jesus
[1:26:47] name they know a woman should dress this
[1:26:50] way they know a man should dress that
[1:26:52] way they know they make kindness of the
[1:26:55] message but they have never met
[1:26:59] God friends I want you to be like
[1:27:02] Moses I want you to have a hunger I want
[1:27:06] you to have a thirst if you have never
[1:27:08] met God to make it a point say I want to
[1:27:12] meet
[1:27:13] God I don't want to remain like this I
[1:27:17] want to meet God because if you meet God
[1:27:21] brother something will happen
[1:27:24] you will be
[1:27:26] changed amen if you ever had an
[1:27:30] addiction that was very dark and
[1:27:33] difficult the only
[1:27:35] solution is to meet God when you meet
[1:27:39] God one
[1:27:41] time sister you cannot be the same
[1:27:44] anymore we have had so many people who
[1:27:48] make
[1:27:50] resolutions many times at the end of the
[1:27:52] year and the beginning of another
[1:27:55] or maybe after H
[1:27:57] someone someone begin saying I'm making
[1:28:00] my from today but you see they go back
[1:28:05] again into the same thing why because
[1:28:09] you're doing it the wrong
[1:28:11] way the wrong way is to
[1:28:14] think that you are the one with a
[1:28:16] solution you have no
[1:28:19] solution God is the
[1:28:22] solution what you need brother what you
[1:28:25] need sister is to meet
[1:28:28] God when that moment comes upon you when
[1:28:32] that presence comes upon you instead of
[1:28:34] making
[1:28:36] resolutions instead of doing that what
[1:28:39] you should do you should yield yourself
[1:28:43] and say God I'm here you have arrested
[1:28:46] Me Now work on me now F me now change me
[1:28:53] now do something
[1:28:54] that my pastor cannot do do something my
[1:28:59] mother my father my sister my
[1:29:01] brother cannot
[1:29:03] do if the things I was telling
[1:29:07] you have not happened
[1:29:09] before then I don't need to tell it to
[1:29:12] you but if it has happened
[1:29:15] before and God literally changed
[1:29:19] people then I I have a
[1:29:22] right to tell them to you
[1:29:26] let me tell you an Open
[1:29:28] Secret I'm one of the people that God
[1:29:31] [Applause]
[1:29:34] changed if you go back in my
[1:29:37] life 25 years
[1:29:40] ago you realize this is another
[1:29:44] person God did something in my
[1:29:48] life I met
[1:29:50] God I met
[1:29:53] God how many have ever met
[1:29:56] God if you have ever met God lift up
[1:29:58] your
[1:29:59] hand these are other
[1:30:01] testimonies you've met God and something
[1:30:05] happened and you know from that
[1:30:08] moment now I'm a changed man now I'm a
[1:30:11] changed woman does God still do those
[1:30:15] things does God still forgive
[1:30:18] sins does God still filled with the Holy
[1:30:21] Spirit you know you have many people
[1:30:25] who decide to to fix
[1:30:31] salvation you know is because they're
[1:30:33] trying it on their
[1:30:36] own but when
[1:30:38] Moses he was trying to fake it the whole
[1:30:42] time but in the presence of God in this
[1:30:46] Pillar of Fire in the burning
[1:30:51] bush he God told him I'm going to send
[1:30:53] you
[1:30:55] he
[1:30:56] said I will not go because how will
[1:30:59] these people believe
[1:31:01] me imagine if God called
[1:31:05] you and he says he's going to send
[1:31:08] you and you know what you have been
[1:31:10] doing and you know your life are
[1:31:14] God how would this people
[1:31:18] believe did you know brother martin
[1:31:20] preached on the power of a call
[1:31:24] you know that each of you has a
[1:31:30] call and when that when you hear that
[1:31:32] call from the Holy
[1:31:35] Spirit you have to
[1:31:38] respond if you don't respond to that
[1:31:41] call you can never have peace in your
[1:31:46] life because we are
[1:31:49] born the purpose God made us for
[1:31:56] I have a purpose in my
[1:31:58] life my purpose is to preach the
[1:32:01] goel I found it
[1:32:03] out I could do business and become a
[1:32:07] great
[1:32:09] business I could become a
[1:32:12] teacher I could
[1:32:14] become an
[1:32:17] actor I I could become an IT specialist
[1:32:24] all these things I'm telling
[1:32:26] you I thought at one time to
[1:32:30] do because I heard and I have the
[1:32:33] ability to do
[1:32:35] them are you hearing me church but one
[1:32:38] day I had the call of God upon my
[1:32:41] life and when I had that call I
[1:32:46] responded with everything in
[1:32:48] me there is a power in the
[1:32:52] call when you respond to that call there
[1:32:55] is something that God
[1:32:57] does in realigning and rearranging your
[1:33:01] life to fit his call upon your
[1:33:05] life but you see many people like
[1:33:08] Moses run away from
[1:33:11] their and here when he met God he told
[1:33:14] God people will not believe
[1:33:16] me they will not even hear my
[1:33:19] voice they would say when they would say
[1:33:22] uh when the Lord
[1:33:25] to the Lord has not appeared to
[1:33:28] you but the Lord answered
[1:33:30] him what is that in thine
[1:33:35] hand ask your neighbor what is that in
[1:33:37] th
[1:33:40] hand
[1:33:42] hallelujah sister Monica what is that
[1:33:46] in don't tell me a
[1:33:49] book there is something in your hand
[1:33:53] there is something in your
[1:33:55] hand I I hope someone is receiving
[1:33:58] Revelation
[1:33:59] now each of you is born with something
[1:34:02] in your
[1:34:04] hand and that thing which you have in
[1:34:06] your
[1:34:07] hand is what will be a
[1:34:11] conduit for God to help you in answering
[1:34:15] your
[1:34:17] call it is the thing that God will
[1:34:20] use toonize against your enemy
[1:34:25] this thing you have it before you even
[1:34:27] realize
[1:34:29] it and you God has given it to you
[1:34:33] before you were even
[1:34:35] born in other words we have all the
[1:34:37] weapons we
[1:34:38] need overcome all our
[1:34:42] enemies the only thing is we don't
[1:34:45] know but God asked
[1:34:48] Moses what is that in th
[1:34:51] hand let us go back a little bit
[1:34:55] before Moses came to the to the Burning
[1:34:56] Bush
[1:34:58] experence Moses as I told you had some
[1:35:02] deals with his
[1:35:05] father-in-law and his deal was to be a
[1:35:10] shepherd and as a
[1:35:12] shepherd He thought as a
[1:35:16] shepherd He needed this
[1:35:18] road so he went in the this
[1:35:22] desert and acquired a
[1:35:25] road is there any
[1:35:29] here I I I had my good old I don't know
[1:35:32] who took
[1:35:35] it you know you know those kind
[1:35:38] of I wish I had one and I came with it
[1:35:41] here I like demonstrating things
[1:35:44] physically and so Moses had his own
[1:35:47] con and this road he had you know made
[1:35:51] it properly
[1:35:53] for the purpose of Harding
[1:35:57] ship and so he had it the whole time and
[1:36:00] he had had it maybe for 40
[1:36:02] years these roads can really last
[1:36:06] long because they dry up and you can
[1:36:09] have it for a long long
[1:36:11] time so Moses had his and when he came
[1:36:15] before God and you know he was
[1:36:17] blabbering words I don't know how they
[1:36:18] will believe me how would they know that
[1:36:20] I've met
[1:36:21] you the only thing
[1:36:24] said he said what is that
[1:36:29] in I believe the holy spirit is asking
[1:36:33] us the
[1:36:34] same what is that in th
[1:36:38] hand Moses had been a total
[1:36:42] failure and I'm reading a quote here in

[1:38:58] failure maybe you been as a student at
[1:39:01] school but you feel like I'm a total
[1:39:06] failure maybe you've been as a
[1:39:09] child to your
[1:39:11] parents but you are here while I'm
[1:39:13] talking you are saying I am a failure to
[1:39:16] my
[1:39:18] parents are you hearing me this morning
[1:39:21] you are saying I am a
[1:39:25] whatever you have
[1:39:27] been let that be has
[1:39:31] been let whatever you have been a
[1:39:35] failure Let It Be has
[1:39:39] been let it become right now has
[1:39:43] been and I want to say start from
[1:39:48] today amen when Moses came in that
[1:39:54] presence whatever he thought he
[1:39:58] was it became has
[1:40:01] been put these things correctly uh
[1:40:04] rather properly in some words here that
[1:40:06] I I thought I should read for you it
[1:40:07] says the
[1:40:09] serpent in biblical
[1:40:12] symbolism often represents evil
[1:40:15] Temptation and
[1:40:19] sin I seen in the story of Adam and Eve
[1:40:21] in the Book of Genesis
[1:40:26] however in this
[1:40:30] context are you following me brother
[1:40:32] Wang yes sir just follow me closely here
[1:40:34] the serpent is transformed you need to
[1:40:36] understand what I'm saying before you
[1:40:37] interpret it for the people if you don't
[1:40:38] understand it you ask me again and then
[1:40:39] you interpret it all right says however
[1:40:42] in this
[1:40:44] context the serpent is transformed from
[1:40:47] a symbol of
[1:40:51] danger and treachery into a sign of
[1:40:54] God's power and
[1:41:00] authority so now we all know that when
[1:41:04] even some when I dream sin when I dream
[1:41:07] a
[1:41:07] snake oh it means sin yes we know that
[1:41:11] we associate serpent with
[1:41:14] sin but in this case of
[1:41:17] Moses god transformed the whole
[1:41:21] thing and he was Now using this
[1:41:25] serpent as a symbol of God's power and
[1:41:31] authority it says this transformation
[1:41:34] serves as a powerful
[1:41:38] image of God's ability to turn evil into
[1:41:47] good and he and to use the seemingly
[1:41:50] Mund and ordinary for his Divine
[1:41:52] purposes
[1:41:56] [Music]
[1:41:59] did you hear that God has the
[1:42:02] ability of turning evil into
[1:42:08] good God has the
[1:42:10] ability of turning evil into
[1:42:15] good that is why the Bible tells
[1:42:18] us all things work together for good
[1:42:24] to those that are called of
[1:42:26] God those that are called according to
[1:42:29] his
[1:42:30] purpose he said all
[1:42:33] things work together for
[1:42:36] good he didn't say some things he said
[1:42:40] all things he he didn't say the good
[1:42:44] things he said all things that includes
[1:42:48] the bad the good the evil the ugly
[1:42:54] whatever it is that has happened in your
[1:42:57] life he said all
[1:43:00] things happen together for
[1:43:04] good to those that love
[1:43:06] God and Accord according to his
[1:43:11] power God has a
[1:43:14] way of turning an ability of turning
[1:43:17] evil into
[1:43:20] good you just simply need to have a re
[1:43:25] to understand how God
[1:43:27] works God works in his own
[1:43:31] ways God works in ways we can never
[1:43:36] imag he can turn the things that have
[1:43:38] happened to
[1:43:40] you in your life amen from Evil and he
[1:43:44] can turn it into
[1:43:46] good are you following me now I want to
[1:43:49] show you here some examples here was
[1:43:52] Jonah
[1:43:54] and God told
[1:43:55] Jonah go to n and want these people of
[1:44:00] my of the incoming
[1:44:03] danger I'm going to destroy all of them
[1:44:06] and what did Jonah do Jonah
[1:44:09] decided to go to
[1:44:12] T reason God Is So
[1:44:16] merciful he he he he he said ah God I
[1:44:19] know you I know you very
[1:44:21] well I've served you for a long time
[1:44:24] you want me to go to
[1:44:25] n and tell these people th say the Lord
[1:44:30] is going to burn you with fire and then
[1:44:33] you forgive
[1:44:34] them these people will call me a false
[1:44:36] Propet they may even end up killing me
[1:44:40] so dear God I am not
[1:44:43] going he decided to go
[1:44:45] to do you know what
[1:44:48] happened on his way you know you know
[1:44:52] the storm comes
[1:44:54] who brought the
[1:44:56] storm God brought the stor or do you
[1:44:59] think it was the devil all things work
[1:45:03] together where was God when Jonah was
[1:45:07] deciding to go the
[1:45:10] opposite why didn't God
[1:45:14] turn all things work together for
[1:45:19] good and then at that moment
[1:45:23] God leaves
[1:45:24] Jonah because God is
[1:45:28] longsuffering you know
[1:45:31] technology sence wants to mimic
[1:45:35] God I've realized many times if you're
[1:45:38] using Google
[1:45:40] Maps and you tell the Google Maps that
[1:45:43] you going to a certain
[1:45:46] direction it will show you that this is
[1:45:48] the best
[1:45:50] roof until you begin
[1:45:54] driving if you miss the
[1:45:58] turn it do not tell you go
[1:46:01] back it will tell you okay now okay now
[1:46:06] let let me show you
[1:46:09] another and then he will show finally
[1:46:12] you end up on that
[1:46:15] Destin the problem is with
[1:46:17] that is if you missed the turn it was
[1:46:20] telling you at first
[1:46:23] you may reach a
[1:46:25] ditch and it is telling you there is a
[1:46:27] way
[1:46:30] there and because according to the way
[1:46:32] it has counted
[1:46:34] everything it is impossible
[1:46:37] to and you reach the
[1:46:39] destination and then you be like no
[1:46:40] Google Map doesn't
[1:46:42] work because it takes you into
[1:46:45] ditches God bless you brother Peter I
[1:46:48] heard you complaining that Google Maps
[1:46:49] take takes you to ditches
[1:46:53] if Google Map takes you into
[1:46:55] ditches it simply means you don't know
[1:46:57] how to use
[1:46:59] it because you have pass the
[1:47:02] turn tell you in 70
[1:47:05] M turn left and then when you reach
[1:47:09] there you
[1:47:11] pass is the road and then you reach
[1:47:15] somewhere it will relocate
[1:47:18] you and then it will tell you okay in
[1:47:21] one kilom
[1:47:23] turn left so in one kilm you will Begin
[1:47:28] Again turning
[1:47:29] left okay this is the and then you will
[1:47:33] continue you somewhere and Google Map
[1:47:36] will tell you turn
[1:47:39] right and right there are people's
[1:47:43] homes there is no Road and then you
[1:47:46] begin wondering what is wrong with
[1:47:48] Google
[1:47:49] Map Google Map has no problem gole the
[1:47:53] problem is with you you keep missing the
[1:47:57] turn and that's why we suffer things we
[1:48:02] suffer God has set a path for
[1:48:06] us but we we turn it
[1:48:08] down and then he leaves
[1:48:11] us but because he loves us because he
[1:48:15] has Grace upon us he will never lose
[1:48:20] us and because he never loses us
[1:48:23] somehow we end up in the right
[1:48:26] [Music]
[1:48:27] destination but I can tell you this
[1:48:29] brother there is a difference between
[1:48:32] someone who arrives with with no bruise
[1:48:35] and someone who arrives with a lot of
[1:48:36] bruises
[1:48:41] over I want to arrive without any wound
[1:48:45] on my
[1:48:47] body I want to arrive amen as perfect as
[1:48:50] he saw me
[1:48:53] you see Jonah when he left that
[1:48:56] path God was quiet and then he reached
[1:49:00] on on this bo
[1:49:01] b and everybody began casting
[1:49:11] lots Mr Man what have you
[1:49:14] done I'm running away from I'm the
[1:49:18] problem okay now cast me down into the
[1:49:23] now he suffered now being thrown into
[1:49:26] the
[1:49:29] SE then he fell in there and the fish
[1:49:32] was
[1:49:34] ready open his
[1:49:36] mouth and swallowed him and Jonah was in
[1:49:40] the B
[1:49:41] of the man prayed there are some prayers
[1:49:45] you
[1:49:46] pray because you made yourself
[1:49:49] pres you left the perfect will of
[1:49:54] brother if you stay in the path that God
[1:49:56] has laid for
[1:49:58] you there are some prayers you will
[1:50:01] never
[1:50:05] pray but when you dodge the path of
[1:50:12] God you will pray prayers you will you
[1:50:16] will never meant to
[1:50:18] pray I've often seen people who are
[1:50:22] walking in the perfect will of God for
[1:50:23] their
[1:50:25] life they tell things happen in my life
[1:50:28] I never force
[1:50:32] it it just
[1:50:34] happens and they think God loves them so
[1:50:37] much loves everybody it happens for you
[1:50:41] that way because you are walking in the
[1:50:42] path he has laid for
[1:50:48] you and then Jonah reached there he
[1:50:52] began pray praying all the prayers in
[1:50:55] you he prayed in all the tongues in
[1:50:59] you God remember me oh God served you oh
[1:51:05] God turn this thing that I in turn it
[1:51:09] around and let Miracle happen he prayed
[1:51:13] and swe and prayed and he prayed
[1:51:17] and I wonder in the bellies in the belly
[1:51:20] of the fish
[1:51:22] I don't know how he was even breathing
[1:51:25] it was God who preserved
[1:51:27] him sometimes you've been in some
[1:51:31] Tom and you wonder someone when they
[1:51:33] hear where you were they wonder how did
[1:51:35] you even
[1:51:37] survive it was the grace of God that
[1:51:42] preserved the long suffering of
[1:51:46] God and he preserved you there because
[1:51:50] you were SE
[1:51:52] and then came out Jonah you know God
[1:51:56] began to hear the prayers of
[1:51:58] Jonah you know that's why I love
[1:52:01] Mah Mah you know said Rejoice not
[1:52:05] against me or
[1:52:07] my when I when I sit in
[1:52:10] darkness the Lord shall be a light unto
[1:52:14] me when I fall down I shall arise when a
[1:52:18] righteous falls down he rises up when a
[1:52:22] writer
[1:52:23] sins he repents are you hearing me
[1:52:27] church and that's what Mah said because
[1:52:31] he had a
[1:52:32] revelation even of what happened to
[1:52:35] Jonah and Jonah in that in the belly of
[1:52:38] the
[1:52:39] fish was praying and praying and praying
[1:52:43] until God commanded the
[1:52:45] fish fish is time for you to
[1:52:49] move did you know the fish was down in
[1:52:53] the depth of the
[1:52:56] sea for three
[1:52:59] days in the same place it was waiting
[1:53:03] for the
[1:53:04] order brother before we
[1:53:08] continue don't fall into the fish you
[1:53:11] are not supposed to fall
[1:53:14] into just go in the
[1:53:17] sheep and go
[1:53:20] where Hallelujah
[1:53:23] but if you Happ to fall into the
[1:53:27] fish you have to be sincere before
[1:53:31] God you have to be
[1:53:33] prayerful you have to yield yourself you
[1:53:36] have to give yourself
[1:53:40] don't don't say I think God is just
[1:53:43] forgiven me don't
[1:53:45] presume be
[1:53:48] sincere be a sincere
[1:53:50] believer come before God
[1:53:54] heartedly and this man as he was there
[1:53:58] God now said okay the fish it's time for
[1:54:01] you to wake up begin going to n and the
[1:54:05] fish began
[1:54:06] moving and it
[1:54:09] moved anded in
[1:54:12] N in
[1:54:15] N God told it all right fish now vomit
[1:54:20] the
[1:54:24] you know the people of
[1:54:26] n believed in a fish
[1:54:30] God
[1:54:33] called so when they saw a big
[1:54:49] fish sent us a
[1:54:52] every one of them started
[1:54:55] repenting and crying and coming back to
[1:54:59] God and the whole city of
[1:55:02] n was
[1:55:05] forgiven what Jonah
[1:55:07] feared still
[1:55:10] happen because it was the will of
[1:55:13] God and then the scriptures
[1:55:16] fulfill to those who love God and are
[1:55:20] the Cod according to his purpose
[1:55:23] so God has a way of turning evil to
[1:55:28] good that was evil that was Disobedience
[1:55:33] but it turned it to
[1:55:35] good and this stuff okay iue here he
[1:55:38] says and um the act of reaching out and
[1:55:42] seizing the Serpent's
[1:55:48] tail also symbolizes faith
[1:55:53] and
[1:55:54] obedience and
[1:55:56] Trust in God's
[1:55:59] plan tell your neighbor trust in God's
[1:56:02] plan for your
[1:56:05] life the fact that Moses follows God's
[1:56:09] instructions without
[1:56:15] hesitation this demonstrates his
[1:56:17] willingness to submit to God's Authority
[1:56:24] and Trust in his
[1:56:26] power father more this verse also
[1:56:28] highlights the concept of transformation
[1:56:30] and renewal
[1:57:18] he can reap your
[1:57:20] life amen
[1:57:22] you might have been born a certain
[1:57:25] way that's why I don't believe those
[1:57:27] people who say well I was born this way
[1:57:29] I'm remaining
[1:57:33] that I believe the first part I Was Born
[1:57:37] This Way But whichever way you were
[1:57:40] born God can reshape
[1:57:44] your he can re the natural order of
[1:57:49] things you were born a liar
[1:57:52] a good
[1:57:54] liar but if you're born again God will
[1:57:58] reshape your natural
[1:58:01] order hallelujah amen you were born
[1:58:06] Immortal you were born a
[1:58:09] dece you know like like Jacob Jacob was
[1:58:13] a
[1:58:15] man he was a
[1:58:18] supp he was a bad man you understand
[1:58:22] what I'm talking about but Jacob after
[1:58:26] all his past
[1:58:28] experience he had also stolen something
[1:58:31] from his father from his
[1:58:34] brother and he even
[1:58:37] feared to go back again to his brother
[1:58:41] because he feared his brother would kill
[1:58:45] him Brother Joseph do you know what
[1:58:48] happened one time the Bible tells us
[1:58:53] that when he he had decided to go back
[1:58:55] to his father's
[1:58:57] house he began sending
[1:58:59] people and things to go and bribe his
[1:59:04] brother still a bad
[1:59:07] man Believers don't pay
[1:59:11] bribe he was going to bribe his
[1:59:14] brother so he can feel better than
[1:59:17] forgiv again he sent another group he
[1:59:20] was sending them in phases
[1:59:23] so that by the time he
[1:59:25] arrives his brother will be
[1:59:34] appeased as he was going on up he met
[1:59:39] somebody he was looking like a
[1:59:42] man he was not a man he was looking like
[1:59:45] an angel but he was not an
[1:59:48] angel but Jacob had a
[1:59:50] revelation of it was whoever this was he
[1:59:55] was more than a
[1:59:57] man and when Jacob met him at first he
[2:00:00] was so much in
[2:00:02] fear thinking I think it is my
[2:00:05] brother he has come to kill me he has
[2:00:09] come so he was in so much fear but the
[2:00:12] moment he was just going around come
[2:00:13] here brother Brian brother Bri the
[2:00:16] moment he was going around and he
[2:00:18] realized someone was following
[2:00:20] him someone was following him and then
[2:00:24] come on come on follow me and then as he
[2:00:26] just did like this his heart was
[2:00:29] pouncing and as he turned he realized it
[2:00:33] is not his brother but it is someone who
[2:00:37] had ability to
[2:00:40] bless he realized it was someone more
[2:00:44] than a man and he was in the in the
[2:00:47] presence of this
[2:00:50] creature creator
[2:00:52] not creature
[2:00:53] Creator amen and he held they held each
[2:00:58] other and they

[2:01:09] leave you I'm going I'm not going to
[2:01:11] leave you until you bless me until you
[2:01:14] bless me and the Bible says they F the

[2:01:27] if and the angel said leave me the day
[2:01:31] is coming leave my knee saiding you and
[2:01:36] his knee too was being

[2:02:27] your
[2:02:30] life he reshapes the

[2:03:05] of Israel the god of Abraham same
[2:03:09] God is our God do you know God can
[2:03:15] naturally rather literally
[2:03:19] reorder the natural Order of Things
[2:03:28] so much the
[2:03:30] extent that people won't recognize
[2:03:35] you say you used to have a lot
[2:03:39] of for

[2:04:51] God has delivered me from other
[2:04:55] things God is
[2:04:57] able to deliver someone
[2:05:02] from someone who has been so
[2:05:05] tossed and driven into that
[2:05:08] life when you meet the
[2:05:10] angel is able to deliver you and set you
[2:05:18] free from immorality
[2:05:23] we've seen people that will literally
[2:05:26] tell

[2:05:31] satisfied they just so
[2:05:35] immoral could be women or could be men

[2:05:42] Prostitute that came to wash Jesus's
[2:05:44] feet you remember
[2:05:46] that how many up your yes that woman
[2:05:51] she was The Prostitute to the extent
[2:05:54] that even people were telling
[2:05:56] Jesus in their heart we wish he knew the
[2:05:59] kind
[2:06:01] of that was touching
[2:06:03] him this woman is so un
[2:06:07] filthy Jesus knew it Jesus wants such
[2:06:11] people to touch
[2:06:14] him those are the ones is
[2:06:18] siek and when this woman came she was so
[2:06:23] committed she was so yielded she didn't
[2:06:26] care what anybody
[2:06:28] else and when she came and touched his
[2:06:30] feet began washing now what was she
[2:06:33] doing today you can do the
[2:06:36] same by washing Jesus's feet with your
[2:06:40] tears if you can go in a private
[2:06:44] prayer you're not going to go squeeze
[2:06:46] your tears
[2:06:47] [Music]
[2:06:48] out Godly sorrow will bring it
[2:06:55] that is true

[2:07:11] have been able to ashame
[2:07:15] thew that Christ could die for
[2:07:19] you it brings God
[2:07:23] and then you begin to think about your
[2:07:26] life like that
[2:07:28] woman why do you think she was thinking
[2:07:30] the whole time she was thinking about
[2:07:33] how many men she has gone
[2:07:37] with and then she went with
[2:07:40] them and left this

[2:07:50] satisfy
[2:07:54] your and this man you know when he meets

[2:08:03] appetites this woman had been with many
[2:08:07] men but among all of them she had never
[2:08:11] been
[2:08:13] satisfied but when she met this
[2:08:15] one she was just so
[2:08:18] touched in a very special way
[2:08:22] that she
[2:08:23] failed I am
[2:08:26] satisfied she cried like she has never
[2:08:28] cried before she saw like she had never
[2:08:31] saw before she began
[2:08:35] powering her tears she picked up a very
[2:08:39] expensive oil of
[2:08:43] perfum what prostitutes

[2:08:48] down you know what do you have in your
[2:08:53] hand Moses had a road he thre say throw
[2:08:58] it down he threw it down whatever you
[2:09:02] have the only thing you have to do is to
[2:09:05] throw it down in his

[2:09:16] realigning every

[2:09:22] God was
[2:09:23] satisfying every thirst she
[2:09:27] had you can debate it all you
[2:09:31] want but this is something that
[2:09:34] happened and if it happened it can still
[2:09:38] happen
[2:09:41] today and this woman being a
[2:09:44] prostitute you know her appetites began
[2:09:48] dying because she had found
[2:09:52] [Applause]
[2:09:54] theallu amen she didn't even care how
[2:09:57] she was being
[2:09:59] judged look
[2:10:01] at she look at this the
[2:10:06] muc something was happening

[2:10:12] qued I'm I'm showing you what happens in
[2:10:15] his
[2:10:17] pres sometimes these things happen and
[2:10:19] we don't know what is going on
[2:10:21] you need to know what happens
[2:10:24] that when that presence come there is
[2:10:27] something happening
[2:10:30] super all of the sudden you begin to
[2:10:33] realize your appetites have
[2:10:36] changed your desires have
[2:10:39] changed why because you have found
[2:10:45] youren and this woman right there she
[2:10:49] left that place
[2:10:51] pure holy sinless cleaned up perfect
[2:10:57] ready for the coming of the
[2:11:02] Lord hallelujah hallu that was not the
[2:11:05] only
[2:11:06] one there was another one you know they
[2:11:09] had even C
[2:11:12] handed in
[2:11:14] adultery this was perhaps a married
[2:11:17] woman and and and she had gone out with
[2:11:19] another another man
[2:11:22] and they called her and according to the
[2:11:25] laws of the
[2:11:26] Jews they had to turn her to
[2:11:30] death so they began running after her
[2:11:35] and they C her but something happened
[2:11:39] some of them remembered there is
[2:11:42] Jesus let us go and see what does he say
[2:11:45] about
[2:11:47] this so they took the woman right to
[2:11:50] where Jes
[2:11:52] the woman was
[2:11:55] ashamed the woman was
[2:11:59] embarrassed that is what sin
[2:12:03] does sin embarrasses
[2:12:06] you sin asham
[2:12:09] you sin strips
[2:12:12] you of all the
[2:12:14] glory and that's how the woman
[2:12:17] was she was living in the life of sin
[2:12:21] everybody would be like they were
[2:12:23] spitting on
[2:12:25] her throwing stones at her beating her
[2:12:28] slapping her and then they came to Jesus
[2:12:32] It Was Written such people we kill
[2:12:35] them what do we do to this
[2:12:40] woman he looked at them looked at the
[2:12:44] woman and wrot on the ground what do you
[2:12:47] think he WR on the
[2:12:49] ground forgiven
[2:12:53] but inside the
[2:12:54] forgiven everybody could see the sins
[2:12:57] they had done
[2:13:00] before
[2:13:02] everybody many times we as human beings
[2:13:06] when we we when we when we catch
[2:13:10] somebody everybody will bring their
[2:13:14] anger you a
[2:13:16] snake a
[2:13:19] serpent they don't look ATS
[2:13:22] but what if you were to change the
[2:13:25] screen and make it look at
[2:13:28] you would you stand there would you
[2:13:31] speak those words you
[2:13:35] couldn't and Jesus used the same
[2:13:39] scenario he showed
[2:13:41] everybody what they had done and he told
[2:13:45] them now the one that has never done
[2:13:50] this cast the first
[2:13:54] stone the high priest and the
[2:14:03] others and Jesus
[2:14:06] was woman is there anyone who condemns
[2:14:11] you
[2:14:14] no and then Jesus said neither do
[2:14:19] I neither do I
[2:14:22] go your sins are
[2:14:25] forgiven tell me any person that came
[2:14:30] before the presence of
[2:14:32] God in this Bible that remain
[2:14:39] us zakas is
[2:14:41] another zakas had blood on his
[2:14:45] hands he had stolen A lot of
[2:14:48] people he was a thief
[2:14:52] he was how does the bible call it an
[2:14:55] extortioner you know you know those kind
[2:14:57] of
[2:14:59] people you know borrow me
[2:15:02] 5,000 I'm giving it to you tomorrow
[2:15:05] tomorrow and it never comes again okay
[2:15:08] just borrow me this time
[2:15:11] 100,000 I promise
[2:15:14] you in the next one
[2:15:17] hour I'm paying it and if you here you
[2:15:22] are like Zak you are an
[2:15:26] extortioner
[2:15:29] yes you are taking
[2:15:31] money and you cheating it you're not
[2:15:34] paying it back I believe is not supposed
[2:15:37] to do
[2:15:39] that a man is as good as his
[2:15:43] what we should be Honorable Men
[2:15:49] Women your amen were
[2:15:54] smaller if you are a culprit repent
[2:15:58] also come in that presence one
[2:16:01] time then you don't know what will
[2:16:03] happen something will
[2:16:06] happen zakas was like that he was always
[2:16:10] even taking he was a tax
[2:16:13] collector and so he had taken a lot of
[2:16:18] money that did not belong to him
[2:16:22] and this man had become
[2:16:25] rich because of this kind of
[2:16:28] things and we have so many
[2:16:31] today even in the Mage
[2:16:33] churches that are
[2:16:36] extortioners you know the Bible says we
[2:16:38] should not accompany ourselves with
[2:16:40] extortioners and
[2:16:43] for we should even excommunicate them
[2:16:45] and chest them from the
[2:16:48] church why because they are bringing in
[2:16:50] that spirit the
[2:16:52] church Spirits are
[2:16:54] contagious but let me bring the other
[2:16:58] side if that person was to come before
[2:17:01] the presence of
[2:17:03] God he cannot remain the
[2:17:08] same and zakus
[2:17:10] heard that Jesus was coming his
[2:17:14] way and what did he do he was a short
[2:17:17] man
[2:17:23] you know those people who have if you
[2:17:25] have ever been
[2:17:28] conned I remember there's a day I was
[2:17:31] traveling to I was in the Zambia
[2:17:34] Tanzania
[2:17:37] border and it was my first
[2:17:40] time I don't remember the name of the
[2:17:43] Border many years ago 201 and so I I met
[2:17:49] you know I think the Zambian man is
[2:17:50] calleda is I don't remember and
[2:17:53] then the tanzan
[2:17:56] called but tanzan Zambian money is much
[2:17:59] lesser in
[2:18:03] value the Zambian money is lesser in
[2:18:13] value so tanzan money is higher
[2:18:19] value exactly exactly and so then I had
[2:18:24] dollars and I also had some um uh you
[2:18:28] know tan
[2:18:29] money and so now I needed to change this
[2:18:33] money into Zambian money so I can be
[2:18:36] able to have a bus
[2:18:39] fair and so I met this
[2:18:42] man and you ask me that question whether
[2:18:44] ever been this is when it happened
[2:18:47] actually so and so I meet this man
[2:18:51] and he tells me how much do you want I
[2:18:54] tell him this much and then he tells me
[2:18:56] okay how much so what's the rate I told
[2:19:00] him he told me the
[2:19:03] rate he said I can't you seen it I said
[2:19:06] yes he was so fast like lightening I
[2:19:11] don't remember how it
[2:19:15] happened is it correct see
[2:19:19] quickly I said yes
[2:19:22] okay but I didn't I was like what what
[2:19:25] exactly did he do is it good I counted I
[2:19:30] realized he had Sten for me like
[2:19:35] $100 half of what I
[2:19:38] had more than
[2:19:40] half what I
[2:19:42] had I almost freezed I felt
[2:19:46] so I felt so foolish and stupid so
[2:19:50] effect and
[2:19:52] so oh my God you even oh God may you r
[2:20:00] c but because you're a
[2:20:02] Believer God forgive you he didn't know
[2:20:05] what he
[2:20:07] did I never C
[2:20:09] people never C
[2:20:12] anybody because you're a child of God
[2:20:15] even when they do something
[2:20:16] about let them take it someone one time
[2:20:20] sto motorcycle from
[2:20:22] me my first
[2:20:24] motorcycle but God gave me a car
[2:20:27] instead if I had C them I would get a
[2:20:30] car don't cuss
[2:20:33] anybody no matter what they do to you
[2:20:37] bless cast not and so I bless that man
[2:20:41] but it was so
[2:20:43] painful and so you know these people and
[2:20:46] I remember one time I was in kaj some
[2:20:49] years ago I was still student at inba
[2:20:52] University and so I was going to see
[2:20:55] over at my mother's
[2:20:57] place and um you know there's a place
[2:20:59] where there's a market around
[2:21:01] there and so I meet someone selling very
[2:21:04] good
[2:21:06] clothing very good trousers and oh my
[2:21:08] God I said this is so nice how much they
[2:21:12] told me so
[2:21:14] little I was excited I paid it
[2:21:17] immediately he showed me the TR I was
[2:21:20] saw
[2:21:21] and when I reached
[2:21:23] home I realized it was only one
[2:21:33] leg I couldn't even tell my
[2:21:37] mother it so embarrassed
[2:21:40] me I just threw it
[2:21:42] away but in my heart I felt I said oh
[2:21:45] God forgive that man he did what he was
[2:21:49] doing
[2:21:51] I was already believe of the
[2:21:53] message but I was so
[2:21:55] fed I was so
[2:21:57] deceived I felt so
[2:22:01] little I was I felt so
[2:22:05] used one one side of the
[2:22:10] trouser same
[2:22:12] color how he did it I don't know but I
[2:22:16] remember seeing the trouser and I
[2:22:18] remember him giving it to me after
[2:22:20] putting it in the
[2:22:22] Cava
[2:22:26] so but later on I leared these people
[2:22:28] are very
[2:22:30] intelligent by the way the the children
[2:22:32] of the children of of Kan are very
[2:22:40] SL he has another person there and
[2:22:43] another one here so as you pulling out
[2:22:46] money he hands over the other to the
[2:22:48] other one and then he brings it says
[2:22:50] give me then he gives this one so the
[2:22:53] other has the other one one
[2:22:55] leg and and the one of two legs another
[2:23:00] and him so you see the
[2:23:03] same when he gives you just do like this
[2:23:06] and you know it is okay when you reach
[2:23:10] home I don't know whether has ever
[2:23:12] happened to somebody
[2:23:14] else is there anybody like
[2:23:16] that I'm the only fool here
[2:23:21] and so friends I felt so bad but same
[2:23:25] thing zakas was
[2:23:27] doing cheating people stealing them of
[2:23:30] their hard and
[2:23:33] resources and he was becoming rich on
[2:23:36] that and he didn't even have a heart of
[2:23:39] feeling for these people but one time
[2:23:43] when he had that Jesus was
[2:23:45] com he climbed a tree just to see him
[2:23:50] just to see him that's why I always tell
[2:23:53] people don't worry how bad you
[2:23:56] are come in the
[2:23:58] church sit down under the
[2:24:01] word let the word work on
[2:24:04] you the word always corrects the
[2:24:08] eror so zakus when he saw Jesus he
[2:24:13] shouted he was on top of the tree Jesus
[2:24:17] was down and so he was on a s tree
[2:24:21] and he said
[2:24:22] Jesus please I invite you to my house
[2:24:27] come and visit me I want you to come
[2:24:31] Jesus actually I'm sure he was doing
[2:24:34] that in his
[2:24:36] heart but Jesus knowing this
[2:24:41] man as much as I said sons of
[2:24:45] Cain but this was not a son of
[2:24:49] Cain you know child of God could be entr
[2:24:52] trumped into a behavior of Sons of
[2:24:57] K but God can deliver you
[2:25:00] too like you delivered
[2:25:03] zakas and zakas took you know Jesus told
[2:25:06] him looked up said zakus in other words
[2:25:10] I've heard your prayer I've heard your
[2:25:12] cry today I will be with you in your
[2:25:17] house I believe Jesus can tell you the
[2:25:20] the same thing right here right
[2:25:23] now how do you know you hear it you hear
[2:25:27] him calling out your name where the
[2:25:30] preacher is preaching you can hear your
[2:25:32] name and say that's
[2:25:34] me Zak said he came out of the up from
[2:25:38] the tree quickly he took Jesus in his
[2:25:43] house he was so
[2:25:45] excited when you meet Jesus you cannot
[2:25:49] be the same you will be
[2:25:52] excited it excites your body it excites
[2:25:56] your spirit it excites your heart why
[2:26:00] because there's a
[2:26:03] transformation taking place and this man
[2:26:07] took Jesus in his
[2:26:09] house and do you know what Jesus never
[2:26:13] preached he was he just went
[2:26:16] there and then zakas
[2:26:19] began what about the money
[2:26:23] after what
[2:26:24] about Jesus said just pay
[2:26:28] back pay back you can start over on a
[2:26:33] new page he said I'm going to pay them
[2:26:36] I'm going to pay them more than I took
[2:26:38] from them it was a
[2:26:41] revelation he wasn't
[2:26:44] C it was a revelation a conviction
[2:26:48] coming from a revelation brother sister
[2:26:50] when you are
[2:26:52] convicted by the Holy Spirit it comes as
[2:26:55] a revelation to
[2:26:56] you how you must come out of a
[2:26:59] situation from that day zakas was a
[2:27:05] say hallelujah and then came the
[2:27:08] soldiers then came the soldiers when
[2:27:11] they met him in his presence what did
[2:27:14] they have all they had was they were
[2:27:18] soldiers and they told him what about us
[2:27:22] what should we do he told them just do
[2:27:25] your job properly don't steal what
[2:27:28] doesn't belong to you don't take what is
[2:27:30] not yours do your job properly in other
[2:27:34] words whatever you
[2:27:36] need is actually already with you and
[2:27:40] when you are in his presence and you
[2:27:43] cast it down in his presence listen
[2:27:47] friends he takes you and begins to
[2:27:51] rearrange and M another
[2:27:56] character praise the name of the
[2:27:58] Lord um give me a few more minutes um
[2:28:01] maybe like 20 I I just summarize I'll
[2:28:03] not summarize I'll just try to see where
[2:28:05] to stop from here so he says this act
[2:28:07] serves as a reminder that God has the
[2:28:09] ability to
[2:28:13] transform and renew not only
[2:28:18] objects but also the lives of
[2:28:21] individuals and the destiny of
[2:28:25] Nations God can
[2:28:28] renew transform the lives of
[2:28:32] individuals and the destiny even of
[2:28:36] [Music]
[2:28:40] Nations many came to him and they were
[2:28:44] transformed there is no way you can sit
[2:28:46] in the
[2:28:47] church if you are hearing what is being
[2:28:51] preached and you don't get
[2:28:54] transformed some of you men you will
[2:28:57] throw away those St pants that look like
[2:28:59] you've been thrown
[2:29:05] inside it's a
[2:29:07] transformation that will take place in
[2:29:09] your life all these fashions that is
[2:29:11] happening
[2:29:12] today the Bible says that we should not
[2:29:15] be you know conformed to the world
[2:29:20] and you find those boys Bo and to dress
[2:29:25] like
[2:29:26] them you put those
[2:29:30] PS up here it tightens you
[2:29:35] so and then your your whole body begins
[2:29:39] to and then down there it is too
[2:29:43] short it looks like you are
[2:29:48] a and then you begin walking
[2:29:53] and you a man shame on
[2:29:55] you and if in this church and you do
[2:29:57] that
[2:29:59] sh we ought not to have any young man
[2:30:02] dressed like that in this
[2:30:05] church pastor they will live let them
[2:30:08] live we stand for
[2:30:11] Holiness we stand for the
[2:30:13] truth we must be an example to our
[2:30:18] generation let them see
[2:30:20] us let them see
[2:30:22] Christ if they can't see Christ in
[2:30:26] us then we we are no longer the salt of
[2:30:28] the
[2:30:29] earth we should be the salt of the
[2:30:33] earth we should be the
[2:30:35] Sal that transformation must
[2:30:38] happen because God Jesus Christ
[2:30:44] transforms he
[2:30:46] transforms are you hearing me church he
[2:30:49] transforms
[2:30:51] he you don't have to struggle on your
[2:30:54] own he can take you and mold in you a
[2:31:00] character that is like
[2:31:02] his the problem many people suffer on
[2:31:05] their
[2:31:07] own and then it doesn't work and then
[2:31:11] they say it doesn't
[2:31:12] work they don't wait longer his
[2:31:16] presence they're no longer patient
[2:31:20] someone comes in the presence of God and
[2:31:22] he not patient he doesn't want to
[2:31:25] stay how even in the
[2:31:28] hospital you can ask
[2:31:30] Dr when you go in the hospital you have
[2:31:33] to
[2:31:34] stay if you're going for an
[2:31:37] operation and it also depends on how bad
[2:31:39] you
[2:31:41] are how bad your situation is you may
[2:31:45] stay a day two or even a month or even
[2:31:48] more than a month
[2:31:51] or even more than a
[2:31:53] month depending on how bad you
[2:31:57] are you need to stay in the presence
[2:32:00] of until God does
[2:32:05] something that's why I've Tau it
[2:32:07] here and I am not ashamed of to teach it
[2:32:12] that I don't
[2:32:14] believe the
[2:32:16] solution to overcoming sin
[2:32:20] is ashaming the
[2:32:22] Sinners I don't believe it that
[2:32:25] way oh brother
[2:32:27] done so has done then pull them and
[2:32:31] bring them
[2:32:32] here confess everything you've
[2:32:35] done it's never been done that
[2:32:38] way never been done that way
[2:32:40] the it's not necessary as far as I'm
[2:32:44] concerned but what changes a
[2:32:48] sinner is finding that presence of the
[2:32:51] Holy
[2:32:54] Spirit once when you come in his
[2:32:58] presence you don't need a preacher to
[2:33:00] tell you you will actually be above the
[2:33:04] law you can be caught by the law
[2:33:08] anymore you have to be
[2:33:12] transformed just as the staff is
[2:33:15] transformed from a symbol of guidance
[2:33:18] and Authority
[2:33:19] [Music]
[2:33:21] into a
[2:33:22] serpent and Back Again God can bring
[2:33:26] about a similar transformation in the
[2:33:27] lives of those who trust in
[2:33:32] him God knows you but he also knows your
[2:33:36] enemy and this is the place where I want
[2:33:38] to to now climax
[2:33:41] on I want you to see in Exodus 7
[2:33:44] ver9 turn there with
[2:33:47] me when Pharaoh shall speak to you
[2:33:50] saying show a miracle for you then Thou
[2:33:53] shalt say unto Aaron take thy Road and
[2:33:55] cast it before pharaoh and it shall
[2:33:57] become a serpent and Moses and Aaron
[2:33:59] went in unto pharaoh and they did so as
[2:34:01] the Lord had commanded and Aaron cast
[2:34:03] down his road before pharaoh and before
[2:34:06] his servants and it became a serpent
[2:34:09] then Pharaoh also called the wise men
[2:34:11] and the sorcerers Now The Magicians of
[2:34:13] Egypt and they also did in in like
[2:34:16] manner with their enchantments for they
[2:34:18] cast down every man is Road and they be
[2:34:21] became serpents but aon's Road swallowed
[2:34:23] up their roads
[2:34:34] [Music]
[2:35:16] okay now friends I I want you to so up
[2:35:18] here and um we conclude on
[2:35:29] this whatever I
[2:35:32] need to overcome my
[2:35:35] enemy is already in
[2:35:38] me I just need to have a
[2:35:42] revelation you know what God gives
[2:35:45] you what God placed in you he also knew
[2:35:49] the enemy you will meet
[2:35:52] a he asked Moses what do you have Moses
[2:35:57] said a ro said cast it down it became a
[2:36:01] it wasn't for nothing because God knew
[2:36:05] that the enemies of Moses in egpt
[2:36:09] Sorcerers amen they would come with
[2:36:12] their
[2:36:14] enchantment all these magicians they
[2:36:17] will come with their enchantment and
[2:36:19] then they will form
[2:36:21] snakes God
[2:36:23] knew are you not so
[2:36:26] glad God goes right into the head of
[2:36:29] your
[2:36:31] enemy and he knows how the enemy is
[2:36:33] going to attack
[2:36:34] you and God has already put the
[2:36:37] resistance in
[2:36:39] you how you will resist
[2:36:42] him because he says resist the
[2:36:45] devil and he will flee from you but the
[2:36:48] resistance
[2:36:50] is already in
[2:36:52] you you just don't know it yet Moses had
[2:36:56] it the whole
[2:36:57] time the only thing he needed to do is
[2:37:01] to cast it down in the presence of
[2:37:05] God cast it down in the presence of God
[2:37:08] and when he went there he told him now
[2:37:11] let me tell you how your enemies
[2:37:13] were when you go before
[2:37:16] them they will ask for a sign
[2:37:20] throw the stick down again it will
[2:37:22] become
[2:37:23] a and then God kept
[2:37:25] quiet God won't tell you what your enemy
[2:37:28] will
[2:37:29] do but God knows it and he has given you
[2:37:34] every equipment you need to overcome
[2:37:37] your
[2:37:39] enemy your enemy could be
[2:37:43] lost your enemy could be the desire you
[2:37:47] have for filthy movies
[2:37:52] worldly
[2:37:53] music I hope there is no believer here
[2:37:56] who enjoys worldly
[2:37:59] music you find a Believer listen
[2:38:17] to and you listen to that
[2:38:20] you're feeding on that no wonder marage
[2:38:23] is not easy
[2:38:25] for you've been you've been listening to
[2:38:28] that
[2:38:29] F what are you listening
[2:38:31] to pastor this is not so
[2:38:37] bad but it is not
[2:38:40] bad it is singing about normal
[2:38:43] life I don't want to be told about no
[2:38:46] more I want to be told about life about
[2:38:51] Hallelujah the music I'm going to listen
[2:38:54] to should be telling me about my
[2:38:56] heavenly
[2:38:58] home Hallelujah that's why you come in
[2:39:00] the church you can't
[2:39:03] pray because those songs squeeze life
[2:39:05] out of
[2:39:08] you and you begin listening to that
[2:39:11] music you know I
[2:39:16] can't imagine list
[2:39:21] and
[2:39:23] list God delivered me from
[2:39:25] that you know just s that because I used
[2:39:28] to listen it just came back to me
[2:39:31] now I used to listen to them oh I used
[2:39:35] to love West
[2:39:37] life and he would put it you don't even
[2:39:40] know who they are it's all right and I
[2:39:42] would listen to that
[2:39:44] music oh you also know so you see and it
[2:39:48] used to be so good
[2:39:50] when I listen to
[2:39:53] him I feel my heart being
[2:39:56] M but my heart was so full of
[2:39:59] sin those songs were massaging
[2:40:03] the but brother when I receive the Holy
[2:40:07] Ghost the desire for those
[2:40:09] Souls just die just die when I listen to
[2:40:15] it now I feel like
[2:40:18] vomiting because because my soul have
[2:40:21] the spirit of God it can only be massage
[2:40:25] with the word and the songs of
[2:40:29] Z so imagine what kind of songs are you
[2:40:32] listening
[2:40:33] to it shows what is in
[2:40:36] you you need that
[2:40:40] presence when you come in that presence
[2:40:43] your
[2:40:44] appetite will be changed
[2:40:51] the things I'm preaching to you this
[2:40:54] morning is the word of God I know it may
[2:40:57] hurt some of
[2:40:59] you but when we go over there you will
[2:41:02] love

[2:41:15] died and then you will be happy over
[2:41:17] there because were
[2:41:20] saved because you were Sav you say thank
[2:41:24] you what you say that day it helped
[2:41:29] me sometimes you don't like preaching
[2:41:31] things which make people feel
[2:41:35] bad but it's a duty of every preacher to
[2:41:38] do
[2:41:39] that it's like going to a
[2:41:42] hospital you tell the doctor don't use
[2:41:45] that injection on
[2:41:46] me there are some people who are very
[2:41:48] good way
[2:41:51] you go to the hospital before even they
[2:41:54] give you
[2:41:54] medicine make sure you don't give me
[2:41:57] tablets and make sure
[2:42:01] injection but you can find something
[2:42:04] else now you have already limited the
[2:42:07] doctor he can't treat you well when he
[2:42:11] gives you the medication you go you
[2:42:13] Doctor your medication is not working
[2:42:16] it's your problem
[2:42:19] the
[2:42:20] doctor to do his
[2:42:22] job allow the preachers to
[2:42:24] preach and don't say I'm preaching about
[2:42:27] you of course I'm preaching about you
[2:42:31] because I'm here to preach about
[2:42:32] you so you can be

[2:42:53] properly so you can be changed it is the
[2:42:56] word to change
[2:43:01] me praise the name of the
[2:43:04] Lord and so these
[2:43:07] Sorcerers they all cast down their
[2:43:09] spells their roads and they became
[2:43:12] serpents God never spoke that
[2:43:14] part he left it for Aaron and Moses to
[2:43:17] find out on their own
[2:43:22] God has left you to find out your enem
[2:43:24] tricks on their
[2:43:28] own but don't worry he has given you the
[2:43:34] resistance I have no fear for Jesus
[2:43:38] walks beside
[2:43:40] me and I'm
[2:43:42] shed the arms of
[2:43:45] God the storms
[2:43:49] the dark clouds
[2:43:51] rise The Temptations
[2:43:54] rise they won't worry
[2:43:56] me I am
[2:43:59] sh within the arms of
[2:44:02] God he walks with me and
[2:44:06] nothing of
[2:44:08] this shall
[2:44:10] me I am
[2:44:13] sh The Arms Of
[2:44:16] God that should be a song
[2:44:20] that should be your desire saying he
[2:44:22] works beside me he's living in me he's
[2:44:26] living with me is the overcoming power
[2:44:29] in me I am not worried about my
[2:44:33] enemy because the the solution for my
[2:44:38] enemy is already with me he's already in
[2:44:42] me because he said I will be with you I
[2:44:46] will be in you the RO
[2:44:49] that was changing let me tell you what
[2:44:52] it is it is the name of
[2:44:55] Jesus that is our Ro it's a ro of
[2:45:00] power The Magicians had
[2:45:03] them the S had them when they came phara
[2:45:08] told them
[2:45:10] come do your
[2:45:12] enchantments let us see what will
[2:45:15] happen and show this
[2:45:17] people they have one
[2:45:20] road but we have
[2:45:22] more of course the gods of the world are
[2:45:26] more but they're less
[2:45:29] powerful you find someone with all the
[2:45:31] collection of
[2:45:34] people may have a legion in
[2:45:36] you I don't care my God is more
[2:45:41] powerful than any that
[2:45:44] of and and you see this you know they
[2:45:47] began en chanting
[2:45:49] I don't even know how do
[2:45:51] they you know how they do it you know
[2:45:54] like those
[2:45:55] people you know just
[2:45:59] [Music]
[2:46:06] come another
[2:46:09] one and they begin to call their
[2:46:13] gods whatever words they were
[2:46:16] speaking speaking their false tongues
[2:46:20] do you know these people were speaking
[2:46:22] in the for
[2:46:25] T and then they would
[2:46:28] throw and every they throw
[2:46:31] down became a
[2:46:33] serpent was what's happening here but
[2:46:38] what Moses did not know what he was not
[2:46:41] told what he
[2:46:44] heard
[2:46:47] swallow that was has not told there are
[2:46:50] things that God has not told
[2:46:54] you
[2:46:55] Hallelujah but in the
[2:46:57] moment it works the name of Jesus
[2:47:01] works the word Works in every
[2:47:05] situation I don't care your
[2:47:07] situation apply that
[2:47:10] situation if you a sinner
[2:47:12] repent and there are sins you can't
[2:47:14] repent yourself
[2:47:20] and there are sins you can't even repent
[2:47:22] to your
[2:47:25] friend you have to come to the Elders of
[2:47:27] the
[2:47:29] church and confess your
[2:47:32] faults so they can pray a prayer of
[2:47:35] faith for
[2:47:36] you some of you can even become ill
[2:47:40] sick you can even get a mental
[2:47:43] issue because you're dealing with
[2:47:47] sin and you don't want to
[2:47:50] it can take you to your early
[2:47:53] grave we've seen people that it
[2:47:56] has possible someone lose their
[2:48:00] mind in the message there was a
[2:48:03] woman she was with brother Bram and she
[2:48:06] had she had a mental
[2:48:08] case she was losing her
[2:48:11] mind and came to brother bam for
[2:48:14] prayer and brother bam cast out the
[2:48:16] demon the demon refused to
[2:48:19] so there are spirits that can refuse
[2:48:23] to because of unconfessed
[2:48:26] sin in the name of
[2:48:29] Jesus said no not yet I have a claim on
[2:48:34] this
[2:48:35] one and this
[2:48:38] woman brother bam told her I need to sit
[2:48:41] down with you so we can have a private
[2:48:44] interview brother bam sat together with
[2:48:46] his wife and sister and they began
[2:48:50] talking to
[2:48:51] her and as he began talking to
[2:48:54] her God began to reveal to
[2:48:58] her to him things about this
[2:49:02] woman so that this woman her husband is
[2:49:05] a
[2:49:06] soldier and her husband had gone to
[2:49:10] War and the woman went out with another
[2:49:15] man and so as brother B began to speak
[2:49:19] the woman
[2:49:21] started please never talk
[2:49:25] about please said why I confessed that
[2:49:30] to the Holy Spirit God forgave me years
[2:49:42] ago about it will kill me he said no you
[2:49:46] already D you already
[2:49:49] I have talk about it heisted have talk
[2:49:51] about it this is where your
[2:49:54] man and the woman said no you K me my
[2:49:59] husband doesn't know said that's where
[2:50:01] the problem your husband has to know you
[2:50:04] have to
[2:50:06] confess you have to
[2:50:08] confess what exactly
[2:50:11] happened and to help
[2:50:13] her reveal to her also the husband had
[2:50:17] done the same
[2:50:21] so said so then this will help you you
[2:50:26] have to confess it to
[2:50:28] your said but you have to help me but
[2:50:31] you have to talk to him
[2:50:33] yourself and so he she did later
[2:50:36] on and they forgave each
[2:50:39] other and their marriage which was
[2:50:41] having
[2:50:43] problems was
[2:50:45] healed the sickness the woman was having
[2:50:50] left and they became so
[2:50:53] lovely what am I saying they are sudden
[2:50:56] sins you can't confess to
[2:50:59] God In Prayer
[2:51:02] alone you already confessed to
[2:51:08] God now you're very
[2:51:13] quiet there are certain things you need
[2:51:16] to come to the Elders of the church
[2:51:20] to be helped to be guided to be
[2:51:25] instructed that's the
[2:51:27] job of of the
[2:51:32] pastor praise the name of the
[2:51:34] Lord and there are certain things you
[2:51:37] need even to speak and confess in the
[2:51:41] church in some
[2:51:45] scenarios so friends
[2:51:48] the the prophet says here and notice God
[2:51:52] told
[2:51:53] Moses what is in your
[2:51:56] hand he said it's a stick a rod just an
[2:52:00] old dry stick of the
[2:52:04] desert where he would have been walking
[2:52:06] along along like this with it in his
[2:52:09] hand that may be all that he had was a
[2:52:14] stick maybe you haven't even got that
[2:52:17] much
[2:52:19] but whatever you
[2:52:21] got give it to God look what he did with
[2:52:25] a stick so what do you have in your
[2:52:29] hand give it to God we might not even
[2:52:32] have a
[2:52:33] stick maybe you only sing a song maybe
[2:52:38] you can testify whatever you got to do
[2:52:41] do it use it for the glory of God no
[2:52:45] matter what it is if you can't sing then
[2:52:48] whistle if you can't whistle testify if
[2:52:52] you can't pass out
[2:52:55] tracks do something else let's get
[2:52:59] going ever what's in your hand use it
[2:53:03] for the glory of God God always had men
[2:53:06] who had stick who would stick by him
[2:53:12] rather and if I had time time only
[2:53:15] constrains me I'll talk to you about
[2:53:18] something
[2:53:19] and how Samson simply had a
[2:53:22] job and how his enemies were on
[2:53:25] him but you see he just picked a job and
[2:53:29] killed
[2:53:31] thousands you know I talk about David
[2:53:34] how David only you know had a
[2:53:37] stone he used one stone in his hand and
[2:53:41] he killed Goliath so whatever you have
[2:53:44] you can use it to defeat your
[2:53:47] enemy there is a a lot of potential in
[2:53:50] you maybe you have a little desire for
[2:53:55] God that is in your
[2:53:57] hands you can use
[2:54:00] that let us stand on our
[2:54:15] feet brother would say I was preaching
[2:54:18] one day in an arena of a football
[2:54:22] stadium and as I went in I seen a little
[2:54:26] sign always encouraged
[2:54:30] me had a big sign there said it's not
[2:54:33] the size of the dog in the fight is the
[2:54:35] size of the fight in
[2:54:43] the it ain't how timid you
[2:54:47] are oh what you
[2:54:49] are brother rise up tell your neighbor
[2:54:53] rise up tell your sister rise up my S it
[2:54:57] ain't what you are it's what Christ is
[2:55:02] that is in you whatever the power of the
[2:55:04] Holy
[2:55:05] Ghost you say well my neighbors will
[2:55:08] laugh at
[2:55:11] me when I got
[2:55:13] saved go get Christ in in there and see
[2:55:18] how you can talk to your
[2:55:21] neighbor see how life will
[2:55:23] change
[2:55:26] now sometimes we preach and think that
[2:55:28] things will happen right
[2:55:32] away this is the kind of sermon that
[2:55:34] you've heard
[2:55:35] today that you are going to have to
[2:55:37] think
[2:55:39] about you really have to do it on your
[2:55:42] own
[2:55:43] time and
[2:55:45] contemplate and say Lord
[2:55:48] how is my
[2:55:50] standing how is my life no I want to see
[2:55:54] you I want to meet you I want to know
[2:55:58] you in the power of your
[2:56:01] Resurrection this is your personal
[2:56:04] relationship with Jesus
[2:56:07] Christ does it
[2:56:08] happen it still does
[2:56:14] happen I'd like us to sing a song that
[2:56:17] says How Great Is Our
