[1:05:53] but i said god i want my
[1:05:58] my children serve you
[1:06:03] my children serve the lord
[1:06:08] that's what i prayed from god
[1:06:15] that that day i reminded god i said god

[1:06:23] i thank god for all the brethren
[1:06:28] who was there

[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:20:16] me
[1:20:18] and joshua had commanded the people
[1:20:20] saying
[1:20:21] ye shall not shout
[1:20:23] nor make any noise with your voice

[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:54] i've been speaking on the subject of
[1:21:56] faith
[1:22:00] and uh
[1:22:02] we did we spoke on the sixth sense
[1:22:07] success is
[1:22:22] he is even now
[1:22:24] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:22:27] and forever yes
[1:22:30] we also spoke on the battle is the lord
[1:22:33] is
[1:22:52] um
[1:22:54] and that's what we are doing this
[1:22:55] morning
[1:22:57] faith in jericho we spoke on uh the
[1:23:00] woman rahab try okay
[1:23:03] and the spies that had come to
[1:23:06] jericho never questions
[1:23:09] the spies that came out from the camp of
[1:23:11] the israelites
[1:23:13] and they had come to jericho to spy the
[1:23:16] land
[1:23:18] and there was no person there that
[1:23:21] really understood who these people were
[1:23:22] and why they came
[1:23:24] out
[1:23:28] for only a woman who actually happened
[1:23:30] to be a prostitute
[1:23:32] attended
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:46] so i we
[1:23:48] realized by the bottom say that faith
[1:23:51] is actually the revelation of the will
[1:23:53] of god
[1:24:01] you see faith is not something you walk
[1:24:03] up oh cooking is a city in kitchenware
[1:24:05] corridor it's not something you say i
[1:24:07] pray too much to get faith switching to
[1:24:09] children and saying something
[1:24:11] is fast too much to get faith deceiving
[1:24:13] you for no and we know there are
[1:24:15] on prayer mountains and fast for days
[1:24:18] and days and months and months
[1:24:23] but we realized from the subjects we've
[1:24:25] been going through
[1:24:26] the attracted to summer to take it down
[1:24:39] [Music]
[1:24:42] oh i saw the
[1:25:29] [Music]
[1:25:38] of his baby animal babies
[1:25:43] because it was revealed to him
[1:25:46] but what god said is true and it is
[1:25:48] coming to pass
[1:25:51] the woman
[1:26:20] that
[1:26:34] my mother my father my brother my sister
[1:26:37] and everyone in my family
[1:26:43] who told her that these people were
[1:26:45] coming to destroy me
[1:27:17] not prevail against
[1:27:18] him
[1:27:20] so now what is this wrong
[1:27:23] this rock is not uh some people say it
[1:27:26] was jesus
[1:27:29] others say you know this rock was uh uh
[1:27:32] you know um
[1:27:34] they say it was uh you know
[1:27:38] you know jesus because jesus was the
[1:27:40] rock and the catholic church was jesus
[1:27:42] it says that jesus was buried there and
[1:27:44] therefore
[1:27:45] the catholic church is built upon that
[1:27:47] rock upon that faith rather upon upon
[1:27:51] peter therefore the catholic church is
[1:27:53] that church which jesus was speaking
[1:27:57] to
[1:28:22] was actually the revelation of who jesus
[1:28:26] christ is
[1:28:39] who do men say that i am i run toward
[1:28:41] you
[1:28:42] and say some say you are elijah
[1:28:47] and then he said
[1:28:49] what about you
[1:28:50] what do you say that i i the son of man
[1:28:54] and peter
[1:29:35] upon the revelation of who
[1:30:47] yeah queen somebody
[1:30:48] that means you're gone
[1:30:52] if you're not
[1:30:53] if you go through fire and you do not
[1:30:55] burn it means you're gold
[1:31:00] oh
[1:31:56] you shout out okay
[1:32:00] then now you can shout out
[1:32:04] now
[1:32:05] i want us to see the background of this
[1:32:06] statement
[1:32:10] now jericho
[1:32:17] now jericho was straightly shut up
[1:32:19] because of the children of israel none
[1:32:21] went out and none came in and the lord
[1:32:24] said unto joshua see i have given into
[1:32:26] thy hand jericho and the king thereof
[1:32:28] and the mighty men of valor
[1:32:30] yes

[1:36:36] let me tell you
[1:37:31] actually the ones who came from egypt
[1:37:33] arrived in this city and entered into
[1:37:36] the promised land they were ingrained
[1:37:37] since from the old generation
[1:37:40] there were only two
[1:37:41] people that was joshua

[1:39:26] again again
[1:39:27] and when they reached that the
[1:39:30] brink of that land with all of our
[1:39:32] concern there was something between them
[1:39:36] and the land

[1:39:53] about what i was going through the same

[2:23:44] let me break
[2:24:10] they said that it was jesus
[2:24:12] writing
[2:24:47] [Applause]
[2:25:26] but why was he riding on a white horse
[2:25:30] because he was coming with her with a
[2:25:33] deception
[2:25:36] when we see white rabbit
[2:25:39] we think all the holy spirit
[2:25:42] but actually
[2:25:43] the devil was coming
[2:25:45] dressed in wise
[2:25:47] to receive the child
[2:25:50] because the people would think i don't
[2:25:52] know and say oh this is god oh no
[2:25:56] the devil i the other day i made a
[2:25:58] phrase
[2:25:59] next
[2:26:00] and i said
[2:26:03] churches today
[2:26:19] many people don't go to church even to
[2:26:21] when you know
[2:26:22] this adventure again because they can't
[2:26:24] find something for their souls
[2:26:28] everyone is suffering and going through
[2:26:30] things they go to church and all they
[2:26:31] find was give a seat
[2:27:52] [Music]
[2:27:54] and the devil has placed them on full
[2:27:56] pieces just
[2:28:22] [Applause]
[2:28:38] to churches
[2:28:40] i said why never got married he said i
[2:28:42] went to church
[2:28:46] i went out of there
[2:28:48] when i was full of lust
[2:28:50] and nun
[2:28:51] i said why
[2:29:17] it has become identifiable
[2:29:21] people making churches to make money
[2:29:26] it's after money prosperity and power
[2:29:28] [Music]
[2:29:30] it's no longer the righteous
[2:29:33] it's no longer after heaven
[2:29:48] in every
[2:30:45] [Music]
[2:30:54] [Music]
[2:30:58] and
[2:30:58] the catholic church the conservatives
[2:31:01] and this i say it's publicly because
[2:31:05] mother six to eight million christians
[2:31:41] new men and oxen is a beast of sacrifice
[2:31:45] of burden
[2:31:47] they were killed they were universal
[2:31:50] kill this woman never told me
[2:31:52] pastor mark apparently you should move a
[2:31:54] baby
[2:32:51] false charts
[2:32:53] declared
[2:32:54] that there will be no one who will
[2:32:56] translate the bible to the common
[2:32:58] language of the people
[2:33:02] and no one is allowed to read the bible
[2:33:32] amen
[2:33:33] we know this preaching
[2:33:35] that that time it seemed ratio when
[2:33:37] apparent when when a black horse came in
[2:33:42] god brought another anointing
[2:33:44] the face of a man
[2:33:46] what
[2:33:59] who translated the bible into the german
[2:34:02] arab bible
[2:34:04] man men like william tinder younger
[2:34:07] william tyndale who translated despite
[2:34:09] by the kjv's
[2:34:12] that's why we read it
[2:34:14] because they tried to kill to
[2:34:16] to destroy the spiders
[2:34:21] you know william tindall would translate
[2:34:23] many many uh uh uh uh would print many
[2:34:26] copies william kinder yakuba and the
[2:34:28] bible
[2:34:40] that is true but what i'm saying number
[2:34:42] he he did many copies
[2:34:46] and the customers would buy them
[2:34:50] and abandon them
[2:34:53] and william tindell would take the money
[2:34:55] they have
[2:34:56] given
[2:35:11] are you okay
[2:35:12] and there are many
[2:35:14] many testimonies of jerusalem when there
[2:35:16] fires on a building
[2:35:19] and they find this bible
[2:35:22] yeah
[2:35:39] and that's when the printing press was
[2:35:40] invented
[2:35:45] it doesn't even say the man who invented
[2:35:47] it never made money out of it
[2:35:52] he sold it off yeah under and then it
[2:35:54] ended up you know making more profits
[2:35:56] and making more bibles
[2:36:01] and so that a printing press was
[2:36:02] invented for the purpose of this bible
[2:36:21] have the knowledge but they don't
[2:36:22] command your translators
[2:36:25] praise the name of the lord
[2:36:27] hallelujah hallelujah and then it comes
[2:36:29] the last anointing i'm afraid
[2:36:32] that was
[2:36:34] the devil
[2:37:01] is a mixture of black white and red
[2:37:11] and this is our generation
[2:37:15] the very last one oh gosh
[2:37:17] the devil satan has come to us i say
[2:37:20] truly
[2:37:21] with all the powers that he came in with
[2:37:24] aliyah collected together
[2:37:30] hey
[2:37:32] he has come to us with a white
[2:37:34] false red horse black horse all together
[2:37:41] the devil today satan needed
[2:37:44] seeks to deceive the child i remember
[2:37:47] the devil today
[2:37:49] seeks to kill the child
[2:37:52] today
[2:37:56] take the word away from the people
[2:38:41] anointed
[2:39:05] [Music]
[2:39:20] this is the last time
[2:39:31] hallelujah amen all our promises and the
[2:39:34] decisions
[2:39:35] we must see them
[2:39:50] there is
[2:40:04] i mean
[2:40:19] joshua had spoken unto the people that
[2:40:20] the
[2:40:21] seven priests bearing the seven trumpets
[2:40:23] of the ramadans passed on before the
[2:40:25] lord and blew the trumpets and the act
[2:40:27] of the covenant of the lord
[2:40:56] the arc of the covenant follows the
[2:40:57] messengers
[2:41:27] exactly
[2:41:28] right how a person can call one somebody
[2:41:31] a prophet and then say they have the
[2:41:33] wrong in revelation
[2:41:38] some people say that is a prophet
[2:41:40] we don't bring them but then again they
[2:41:42] say he was not having a correct
[2:41:44] interpretation
[2:41:47] it's not possible
[2:41:49] if he's a prophet
[2:41:50] divine revelation comes to a prophet
[2:41:56] and here we see
[2:42:10] to look at versus starting let's skip a
[2:42:13] bit we go to verstappen starting
[2:42:16] bring it to try to bring it to our
[2:42:18] climax now
[2:42:21] are you tired
[2:42:24] all right that's good verse 13 to 15
[2:42:26] says and seven peace bearing seven
[2:42:28] trumpets of ram's horns before the earth
[2:42:30] of the lord went on continually and blew
[2:42:32] me with the trumpets and then the army
[2:42:34] men went before them but they reward but
[2:42:37] every but the reward came after the act
[2:42:40] of the lord the priests going on and
[2:42:42] blowing with the trumpet and the second
[2:42:45] day
[2:42:46] they compassed the city once
[2:42:49] and returned into the camp and so
[2:42:52] they did six days and it came to pass on
[2:42:55] the seventh day that they rose out in
[2:42:57] the in the alley about the dawning of
[2:42:59] the day and compassed the city after the
[2:43:03] same manner
[2:43:04] seven times
[2:43:06] only
[2:43:07] on that day they accomplished the city
[2:43:09] seven times
[2:43:16] s
[2:44:02] all right now in the same manner the
[2:44:03] bible says
[2:44:05] in the same manner
[2:44:07] the same way they went around the city
[2:44:12] the first day
[2:44:14] it's the same time they went around in
[2:44:15] the second half
[2:44:57] we believe in the blessings of god
[2:45:01] believe in the power of god
[2:45:04] from sin
[2:45:07] of the world
[2:45:08] [Music]

[2:45:43] to improve on their doctor
[2:45:47] why are they not
[2:45:49] ordaining women
[2:45:53] because the word did not allow them
[2:45:58] why did they improve on their teaching
[2:46:04] simple
[2:46:07] you tell me no no no no pastor that is
[2:46:36] so what happened gotta teach you to see
[2:46:38] women why didn't they do it
[2:46:44] but now
[2:46:45] they want to accept
[2:46:47] that
[2:46:48] no need that so what
[2:46:50] happened cow
