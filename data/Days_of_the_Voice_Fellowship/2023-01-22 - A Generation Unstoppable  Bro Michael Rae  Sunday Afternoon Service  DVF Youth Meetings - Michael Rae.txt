at five o'clock but we won't rush time and it's their last service I was talking with brother Isaac we quoted Romeo and Juliet Roman Shakespeare in the Shakespeare Shakespeare Shakespeare yes yes parting is such sweet sorrow foreign but it means we also are leaving out yeah sorrowful but the other part of that until we meet on tomorrow oh that's my brother Brandon would sing the song often yeah [Music] till we meet me [Music] amen [Music] oh isn't that beautiful I wish I could just take you all with me on my plane when nothing happens I just have to let the pilot know the pilot the the pilot of the plane yes I need to let him know everybody else off the plane I gotta bring oh you're with me I've just loved being with you this last few days I mean it's just so humbling to be able to speak with you yeah I just couldn't express my love enough I Echo brother Isaac your singing is beautiful yeah we're so correct yeah thought how the Angels cry holy holy is the Lord I said well I think the Believers in Uganda are shaking Hosanna Hosanna don't never stop never stop I mean I want to thank just from my heart for the opportunity to be here again it does indeed take a burden it takes Faith let's try our local kid is up takes Faith to walk you step out in faith that's not easy to do and so he steps out in faith and look what has transpired [Music] I just appreciate the musicians all the technicians in the back it's a lot of work God bless you I mean those that have cooked and have helped you eat Brother Martin I know a incredible amount of work it's worth it all it's worth it transpired here today only eternity will be will be it what's up to tell it all foreign [Music] now I I was I had a sometime this morning or this morning service some parts of the service I was having a tough time because I was saying brother Isaac don't go there please don't go there and he went there amen and then he'd go somewhere else okay that's good amen and he'd go back around don't go there but the Lord has a purpose he has a purpose so maybe like a stamp [Music] and you put a stamp on the paper if you take time with just a little pressure the image is there everyone do you cook so the image is there on the on the tablets of your heart this afternoon it might feel like the holy spirit is just putting a little more pressure what you heard this morning maybe you'll hear a little bit of the similar thought this evening but it's just God pressing this is man this morning hey man I heard you aiming yeah I heard you now I hope you are amending the words amen Amina so let the word speaking that's what we spoke this morning that's why you could amen the word can speak let's turn to First Peter 1. I'm going to speak tonight on we'll just continue kind of the theme of our titles and some of it will maybe just kind of tying some of the thoughts through the through the last few services so we're going to speak tonight on a generation hey man we're an unrestrained generation with power to finish and be unstoppable First Peter 1 22. okay fine verse 22. seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptable seed but of incorruptible by the power of the word of God by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all grass or All Flesh I should say is as grass and all the glory of man as the flower of grass the grass weareth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever amen and this is the word by which the gospel is preached to you amen amen foreign [Music] foreign you don't have to turn to it if you if you if for a sake of time but I'll just read Ephesians 2 and 4. but God who is rich in Mercy for his great love we're with he loved us even when we're dead in sins quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved Amen in verse 8 it says for by grace are ye saved through faith and not that of yourselves it is a gift of God Corinthians four and seven he says but we have this treasure in Earthen vessels one of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not yet I love all those the butts in there you might be perplexed but not in despair you might be persecuted you might feel cast down but you're not destroyed why because something's inside of you heard this morning like I said it's gonna be the stamp going a little further tonight now you go through life and we come across I'm just I'm just going to bring it down to a start here who is your most favorite singer the most skillful soccer player is oh is it I thought maybe I'd hear like Ronaldo was on to about um by all by the world see Messi Messi it's pretty much Unstoppable [Music] These Guys these guys are on the a top of their game yes yes uh don't be quiet like you don't know what I'm talking about no brother Mike I have nothing I don't know nothing about them that's okay um you know back home in Canada we play hockey ever do you know what hockey is not much ice here there's lots back home so we have hockey players we got basketball players basketball and they attain us certain level where they become Elite nobody can match their ability they become a superstar and really Nothing is Stopping them in their careers they've got the the the the ability and it's enabled them to attain a certain level it almost almost they worship Him all right they worship Him because it's their God it's okay it's soccer um everybody gets a little bit quiet you're like whoa it's okay but what I'm trying to tell you is they have traits something inside of Messi has enabled him to attain a certain level all right whether it's in business business education Obama business whether it's an art in music there are people that attain the top will be in 12 years but there is one thing one thing that stops every one of them [Music] they might foreign every single one of them come to a point and death stops them in there [Music] not one of them they're stopped amen Amino and so man has searched they search for the the special uh you know drink that can bring them Eternal use man doesn't want to die so all through Humanity that's why there's two times of someone searching for the Fountain of youths because they're searching for something no it's gonna stop them at some point that's why in England they are searching for the Holy Grail yes what do you Grail Holy Grail it's like a cup that has a liquid in it that would make you forever let's just put it simply they want eternal life man wants eternal life that's why they're obsessed with their superheroes yes maybe maybe not in Uganda maybe not in Kenya but back in North America superheroes are a big deal Hollywood is pumped to the superheroes Hollywood and Superman always is kind of on the topic Superman that's my Superman but he never dies Who Never Dies he's just continued all through time he has never died yes but Balor was on Superman it's we'll get there some new villain comes up some bad guy oh um it's gonna be a tough service huh film Anda are we there ah we got there what was that yes every time a villain comes Superman succeeds he's got x-ray vision he can file like faster than speed of sound bullets hit him and bounce off that's why everybody's drawn to Superman yes Superman he's Unstoppable Amina you know how he draws his strength it's just what they say we're about to have a Gamba he flies up into the light of the sun and the and they're coming from the from the Sun and his body's able to sit the size energy and he's invincible and and Humanity loves him because something they're yearning for something they're Desiring those traits you're Desiring somehow there's got to be an invincibility somewhere again and so man has looked everywhere for it hmm I'm gonna tell you it does exist it does existed they just haven't been looking in the right place let's look for it let's go back to a Garden of Eden cartoon where there was a time when one walked through a garden invincible but something happened a deformer stepped in his desire for a super ability scripture says how are thou fallen from heaven or Lucifer son of the morning how art thou cut down to the ground which did we kiss the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I that's what saying he was designed to be so he said I'm gonna foreign [Music] and he starts to begin his task to build his own Force he's taken a portion of the Angels [Music] he takes the Angels portion of them out of heaven and steps into the garden and deceives Eve brother Brandon says even before this foreign God is waiting to this time to bring you up so that your room would be foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah that's why like brother Isaac said this morning it's not by my dog but by my spirit man you heard it this morning it's not your marriage it's not your failures it's the sea the sea in sequel the sequel that he deposited in here by his grace amen and a perfect one step down the head Crusher yeah kakati and so then we slip over onto the other side of Resurrection God's seed starts yeah another age it's now being deposited into his people now it starts moving through Ephesus foreign [Applause] [Music] or something be value but think there's others that come later it's just waiting for its seasons you know God didn't uh you're not an afterthought God doesn't have after that Pond or something he doesn't have a thought yeah foreign [Applause] and you will be unstoppable [Music] you think you've got all through the Old Testament through their struggles and trials you think that he finally got his seed and he raised in Jesus Christ raised up you don't think that he's going to bring his seed to maturity foreign [Applause] amen [Applause] does that mean Satan isn't gonna try it he's gonna try again you'd think by now he would he'd feel it's futile it's futile [Music] but he's like I'm gonna try at least until he gets his spray out again start spraying Through the Ages [Music] maybe this person is maybe this person foreign turn this bread into stones that was the devil oh yeah butter brownham says you see them religious Devils today or still saying the same things [Music] if there's such a thing as Divine healings that's the devil foreign [Music] [Applause] amen just go back to the word it is written Jesus dealt with him he said the same devil stood up sorry let me restart where I wanted to start there he said the devil tried again seeing him asleep when he went here all the Raging storms foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I don't care how much spray so far but you've been covered nothing [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] amen you remember Superman or you could almost say that Superman is a negative almost almost said you're well man he's a negative Superman but this Superwoman this super church that's Superman Drew strength from the Sun or foreign [Applause] that's where your strength is [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] man just Taps into inspiration when it's really just a type of the real reality um you want to be an invincible Army draw strength Chino strength not from the world from WhatsApp not from nothing on Hollywood not from no music simple numbers [Applause] got it amen oh man you know inside a seat oh man yeah inside a seat it has all the DNA music right it has the genetic code of every part of your body all right genetic code of your dad is the whole human genome so they've now mapped out aspect of what a human being the structure is I told you because if there's a there's a defect what did you not they're they're they're trying the technology right technology we're sending a microscopic scissors and snip out and a just a genetic structure so they can find its weakness and creative vaccines okay I just want to let you know tonight the seed inside of you it's uncrackable yo that's someone [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] is a mystery to him amen you are God's history [Applause] [Applause] you're like sorry never [Applause] I'm word protected anything for me [Applause] I've got an Unstoppable seed inside of me amen that makes the demons amen Amina Hallelujah [Applause] amen amen okay let me let me come to a final Let's do an end here somehow they come back in so now I've told we let's just agree together that you're unstoppable um foreign [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] see you tomorrow [Applause] hallelujah amen yes sir amen Hallelujah amen amen [Music] so now that's your confession and you didn't you did with me so as I said at our first service [Applause] hey man listen there was no way one minute [Applause] Hallelujah um [Applause] foreign [Music] thank you foreign [Applause] [Music] [Music] thank you thank you foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes sir yes thank you [Applause] Hallelujah Hallelujah yes yes thank you Jesus thank you Lord Jesus Christ [Applause] thank you Lord oh thank you Lord [Applause] [Music] sold Joseph for a bad thing yeah and it would come to evil but really it was to come to some good maybe Joseph went there so he could save them so the devil he always tries to do things but really on the other side let's bring in some good Powers so he thought he could put his finger on a fuse box turn on some lights and power here but really it just brought praise to God [Applause] it didn't do anything music but bring glory to him so next time the devil looks to flick the sword he might question himself again I won't do that again amen amen [Applause] in case you forgot it uh we left off where you drew your line okay that's where we that's where we left off so we'll just go a little more David anointed willingly stepping in the battle Daniel Daniel did not quake as he was taken to Alliance I don't believe for a moment that Daniel's knees were shaking he was brought to a denim no way yeah those Hebrew boys we're crying tears they weren't worried day shoulders head what's up and they walked away because God was wanting to express himself so he had to bring them to a fire he has to bring you through a trial fiery trials [Music] just step on your seats it wasn't until it was seven times hotter foreign foreign [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] foreign he's like Shirley did I surely after six thousand years surely surely for sure I have done it in six thousand years surely I've been able to use mm-hmm but in the midst of Eden chaos Satan's Eden yesterday you're still oh man When sin sin is at its highest magnitude [Music] its highest wretchedness six thousand years of sin strength total gross Darkness amen but still now yeah AC El cigo with a force [Applause] yes [Applause] foreign foreign I got just a little more I know it's hard isn't it I know money God makes rugged cut Christians foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] oh sir I don't know where men and women of Faith well brother Brandon says well you know sister I believe it's all right for her to have short hair certain hairdos [Music] it's a rugged gospel these were printed before I came here I don't have a printer here and brother Isaac's notes were printed a different time so if you look on my notes says here must I um [Applause] While others fought to win the prize [Music] that's God speaking to you must I be patted on the back should I be babied like a toddler um foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] sometimes it might it just feels like the devils okay [Applause] but you know there's some fights it just some boxers they just don't stay down um [Music] sometimes it may be some of you felt before you got here this like they're out oh no yeah but you dragged yourself into it [Applause] foreign [Applause] Hallelujah [Applause] um [Applause] foreign [Applause] watch out wanna hey hey hey hey [Applause] there's been some great boxing matches of time there's been some big head-to-head battles um uh-huh you know when you were in Romans days there was Gladiators they have a Wonder one battle okay listen real careful now in the western days over in USA America duels and they go out into the street it's a one-on-one okay do you know Muhammad Ali foreign and he knew he was a boxer yes he had a punch okay he is he was the greatest oh man oh man in a bad way he says I'm the prettiest I'm the best then singer I sting like a butterfly hahaha [Applause] he had a fight they called it in Manila Philippines they had he had another one called The Rumble in the Jungle Jango Congo these were major fights foreign but there's a head-to-head battle that is much greater that's been happening for six thousand years [Applause] and since the fall in the garden Satan has had a champion Called Death and Satan's champion of death has been in the ring with Humanity [Music] every time a human would come true Moses Musa with all the Miracles yeah yes nobody know Samson Samsung he was strong he was anointed with strength but he had to step into a ring with death and death probably became boring after a while no contest brother Brandon says last night we find out that the devil has a power and that power is death he said that he said he finished he said that's how he brought Moses right down all the children he said that's how he took Abel's lineup but God brought Seth back says and he's tried to kill all the children he said but there's no ever stopping God's program [Applause] amen so will you allow me just to maybe dramatize an event of time okay because something happened that day on Calvary Hallelujah the devil looked down and he said you think you're the Son of God he wondered because he threw up questions if there'll be if he was wondering is this really him is this who he says he is just not solid enough for me and he then cried it is finished and death stopped walked up [Music] foreign [Applause] but when he drew his arm back wow that was a little different he goes running back to Satan's headquarters he says uh something just happened the devil's like yeah what just happened well I was just there at Calvary and I gave the knockout punch of death it to that one called Jesus I don't know exactly it just kind of felt like my power just drained from me oh that's ridiculous what are you talking about [Applause] just just hold it right there someone's at the door go and answer that we'll continue [Applause] somebody stepped into the room [Applause] um somebody stepped in the room because a prophecy would not be had gone forth hundreds of years so Jesus had no concern yes foreign [Music] he said it is thought he had finished yes and they said yeah well I thought I had you when I killed Abel I thought I promise and I thought I had it now with apple but then John the Baptist came and out I had to send death again but then you popped up I've been wondering all this time are you really who you say you are yeah foreign [Music] but you had me wondering because you didn't answer anything but the devil says but now now I've got you hey I think I think our Lord just left a little bit of time there for Satan to feel like he had the victory in other words foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] undefeated [Music] until one came and stepped in the ring and before death could even Blinky [Applause] before death could even think about it could nobody had ever penetrated foreign [Applause] she said my seat will rise again you can't hold me here [Applause] brother Branham says [Applause] I think it's because the devil just stood there in shocked yeah yeah [Applause] yeah excuse me the keys to death in Hell the keys to death hallelujah hallelujah jerk them off he said push Satan back slam the door in his face [Applause] amen and took over and conquered hell and yeah the Unstoppable seed is [Applause] amen hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] he said come on now it's breaking daylight over Jerusalem we gotta get out of here [Applause] he says we're going up together waiting for the time of my blood but my blood is now shed on Calvary I am the Incarnate Son of God all debts are paid we're on the road out together What A procession that would have been [Music] um empty Paradise he said let's go together [Applause] [Laughter] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] yes [Music] [Applause] [Applause] amen and as our lord Jesus led the procession I think he just turned over his shoulder yeah buddy with a voice that penetrates the Realms of Eternity you can Pierce into a supernatural realm through the dimensions just try and stop me yes foreign [Applause] [Applause] musicians you can come conditions can come on baby may you never forget what is inside of you that is [Music] you're not [Applause] just before we sing you know death when you get knocked out to kind of shake his head death is still at work he lost his impact it is completely you know when he comes and a child of God must go home remember death and he actually can only put his punch out there when he's allowed so when a child of God must cross over um death has to wait foreign [Applause] [Applause] yes wait a minute but I I hope maybe if God would allow it because there's coming a Time when Time and Eternity and somebody is going to be on their deathbed again and they're just about ready to take that final breath you and death is standing there is a and if God would allow it I will put out the Death Punch but right at that moment okay a cry goes out and in a moment in the twinkling of an eye this one that was dying and death puts his punches but right as he meets them and this one who is gonna die it suddenly changed and this says wait a second I don't go it hasn't happened before only one time has someone been able to go against my punch yes that's right The Great I Am whose seed that was oh yes and at that moment foreign [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] what is amen [Applause] [Music] generation amen

preacher that's evangelist the Evangelist is a creature right off lugana is just confusing us brother Isaac is an evangelist Isaac amen Amina there is and brother Michael's gift is more of pasture instructive uh constructive instructive not constructed okay and that brings stimulation of Revelation different gifts in the body is the same God thank you brother Isaac for accepting my invitation

Brothers here that have been quite the whole time have a day but they have not really been silent because when they were out there they evangelized and actually I don't know whether she's still here it sled but there is a sister Lydia is she here sister she's left Lydia yeah yeah okay is she here is she outside she left okay so I hope the brothers were able to get to get our contacts about that Miranda did you get our contacts is that somebody who got our contacts him anybody can I can did you get Oh Brother Martin outside oh they have address you have a address and she was so enthused that she had to come to the meeting and so these brothers did not travel in vain [Applause] thank you now I should say this before I forget very early in the morning tomorrow myself and brother Michaela Michael will be headed to on a trip to karamoja now I know got sounded scared how men have been to karamoja before raise up your hands so most of you don't even have an idea of what I'm talking about um that's one of the most beautiful places I've ever visited people with pure hearts I love the Lord with all their hearts and uh there are very many Believers they're very many Believers might have more Believers than in Kampala I am not sure but I think so in the kitchen doors so they the mission arm kakati of the Church of brother Michael called Bible Believers something foreign but anyways the the crocodile Bible does missions I'm sorry brother would you like to help you I I know we have we have overused we have overused the uh our brother here Pastor center from the beginning of the convention and I know he's wearing do we appreciate him um [Applause] thank you Pastor yes I know you're not a young man and this has been a platform of young men from the beginning for joining our team amen amen how many love Brothers he makes sure you get everything the preacher has said foreign by the number so they get a sticky arm of Cloverdale so now brother Eddie biscal oh uh met brother Branham and he was a friend of Barnum yes and uh actually the reason why I'm connected to this church my Ministry and my believing was actually groomed by Brothers um because when we believed when I believe the message I I was I was very very intelligent and I thought I didn't want to be fooled so these people talking about a prophet from America what do I have to believe what what a white man has to say to me did the white people believe anyhow so I decided to go on the Internet and try and find out message other countries other than Africa and what they believe and what they preach at that time our pastor what they were what they would do they would just read from the message and explain to us but I wanted to know the source so when I searched the church I found was um and um there's another website also I found by the way it's a very good website um I do not remember anyway but uh it's a very good link I wish I would remember if I remember I'll let you know yeah it has a lot of information so there's a fellowship there in Newfoundland Newfoundland and the pasta there really had a burden to take the message out and his website on the internet was the very first about William Branham way besides and it's called William Branham homepage.org so if you go there it is so please I'm asking you even if you have your phone now write it down or if you have a paper write it down he has a lot of information about the message William Branham [Music] homepage.org William Branham home page so when I when I searched on that website I was so enthused um information this other one I found videos of preachings and they saw this old man preaching on fire he was like on fire because if he was stepping on the stones of fire and I was like but I want I want what this old man has foreign because he was preaching something that he seemed to really know about Dallas and I'm actually encouraging I'm saying this because I know you you're going to go and search these things out you go and search brother Eddie biscuit Ministry in the testimony on the internet internet YouTube you can find it I believe he gives a first-hand testimony of his life of his time with the prophet and how he learned that he that brother was Elijah yeah how many I believe amen those who don't know about what I'm talking about you can come and let us know so I would like to go in in much detail because of time but brother Eddie has evangelized in a lot of countries and like I said brother Michael is a grandson to brother but he is not preaching because he's a grandson of other end he knows what he's talking about amen and uh I was thinking as brother Ed went in Malawi and other African countries and India um now also doing the same so I I don't know Brothers you you can tell me how many uh Brethren visits but uh brother Michael was willing to go and we are going to be visiting most of the part we're going to be in yeah and they're going to be there not just to preach we're going to be there for an entire week doing uh the work of the Lord so we ask for your prayers pray for brother Michael that God will give him Supernatural on that mission how many think we should have this again amen amen how many things we should have these meetings again I can see all of us think the same amen we are going to have this again together amen amen Amina so this is just the beginning next year around the same time I'm looking forward to another wonderful time amen Amina how many steps should come again hallelujah hallelujah amen this Kenyan man said that you can hate him but love what
