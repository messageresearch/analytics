The Giver of every gift that comes give us that gift Lord especially the gift of the Holy Spirit answer the questions revive the Fallen laws speak to our hearts Lord we are hungry for you we need your

know where to begin from but I love you so much amen amen I love you pasta your pastor is my friend I think we have many things in common the way he preaches I love it so much but serious preachers who preach what they live and who live what they preacher praise God amen amen new faces and I'm glad to see new faces like one and a half years some of you we are not here but I appreciate the Lord where you are increasing in numbers [Music] [Applause] that when I come back home because I'm very sure I will come back again [Applause] when the pastor lays me to come back I will come [Applause] amen um I trust when I come back I'll find Obama I'll find when you're in a new church or this one will be full with tent outside praise God Amen I would love to know the mother of our pastor hey [Applause] this young girl [Applause] if you hope you have then then we have to praise God because the word tells us he shall always renew our strength amen so you can't believe when you see my Mama she's younger than you even Mama amen because because he fulfills always if you see my dad his people calls him our brother so uh I think those are one of the benefits of believing amen amen because that is the word also Amina amen so I receive greetings from our church also foreign amen uh uh their brother Peter yeah I fast Richard Brothers Peter's Place uh Peter is also my friend my best friend yeah yeah I'm Western Uganda India yeah I did not know that he was planning to snatch somebody from us but it's also good that but a good thing is that our person went the right hands amen in the side of marriage and also on the spirituality and spiritual side is the most important because when they came decide I was so concerned to find out where their Fellowship is because that is the most important amen amen so also those who doesn't know me my name is yeah you come from where you are told Western Uganda is yeah we have the same faith we believe the same message we believe in the baptism of the Holy Spirit we believe in Baptist baptism in Jesus name we also don't believe in women preachers and the I think our women cannot feel bad because we have said it like that because it is the will of God amen amen so we have many things in common to enable me to being there before we still we believe the same message we believe the same messenger praise God Amen and we are always happy together what did we give God for us to be granted this kind of a privilege foreign foreign [Music] to believe this message for God to ordain you katonda cartoon that at this moment did you say what you said at the seventh Church age at the end of it that you shall receive this message amen amen the word says behold I send you Elijah the prophet before that Dreadful day and he shall turn over turn the hearts of the children lest I come and smite the Earth amen so believing this message we must believe it with all our hearts I mean with all our hearts the second is believing the message is like I can say it is different from you know we don't want to be just like regular Believers says that when they meet us sisters with long hair with long dresses we should go beyond that amen amen I think now in the time we go into the word of God I mean again do you love him amen amen so let's stand on our feet foreign The Book of John foreign first chapter and 28th verse these things were done Beyond Jordan when John was baptizing the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and said Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sins of the world and this is the hymn of whom I said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and I knew him not but that uh but he that he manifested to Israel therefore I am baptizing with water John bear record saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abort upon him saying I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove and it abound upon him foreign foreign auntie or your your money by God Grant the blessings may be seated amen amen so much this morning I may not run very fast I'm used to running but I pray that God gives me the grace let it be like a teaching service because because teaching is also important sometimes you want to run and we get strength but we need both of us is what I want us to the church and its conditions amen amen so that is what I want us oh I will start by quoting I want to speak to you to you this morning on a parable on some way that even the most unjust person here would be able to understand by your Obama now we come to church to better ourselves amen we come to church to better ourselves what does this mean it means foreign but you don't need to leave this place the same as you came in why not there must be a difference we are expecting we don't expect a child to be nice and remain lying down when a child is being born there must be a condition of growth praise God Amen that the child will reach a time and it will begin state if the child will eat he will start with the milk there ain't no cooler but he must grow I know he must reach a point of eating solid food he must work all those things are in that child potentially [Applause] I mean what do I mean praise God Amen um when uh when uh when the baby's a boy Amira Tata that baby is is in a potential to be a father if he's a she is a mama she is a mother she may be young so even now in this church where we are today sometimes we come when we are sinners sometimes knowing some little things but we must grow we must move from another level to another level when we come here without the Holy Spirit we don't expect to remain without the Holy Spirit when we come here when we are weak that is we don't expect to remain weak quarreling foreign what have I said huh over gambling praise God Amen we don't expect to remain the same way and when we remain with such things we cannot get anywhere there is no other level we can attain to cigarette regular Christians but we're having nowhere to go but as a human being individual I believe when I speak something here foreign but you will hear another story praise God Amen those things happening in my Ministry way of being treated I've found such kind of things I don't want to say that it is because of three kinds of believerses because they are another kind of believer we are here to better ourselves we don't come here and sinners to remain Sinners but God is expecting us that after the service they become holy men and women of the Gospel we become holy goddess holy boys we don't want to become a stumbling block we don't want to become an independent to the church we don't want to bring questions here we are here for a purpose God is Holy and his Holiness us to be righteousness because it is foreign foreign love this seat here than to be a member here [Music] you are not the foreign together [Music] praise God Amen that is not black and white bat tell anybody watching you are either black or you know because you are either on fire foreign [Music] oh praise God Amen we want to go to heaven again we cannot remain in this conditions you will see them they understand where they are going is what we must live up to check amen sister we want sisters she will know very well that she's wrong she's in sin living in a fornication life let me say let me speak it ah um and they're the one who knows how to sing they have such amazing voices number two [Music] I don't know why but God is so kinda but if I was God I would say I will speak and say stop lying people sometimes the singers are just nice and you clap your hands sometimes we when actually the hippocrite has given us special amen I think I'm not quarreling [Laughter] guys amen amen so we must be on fire for God we must be better now we come to church to make ourselves better people about our balloon better citizens we come because Christ has told us if we come ask anything he would be with us and would Grant it to us than to know what we are at church foreign foreign amen Amina amen you know we are here and I always remind people we are not here to to enjoy this life here on Earth we are here to live for God we are here to prove to the world that they are still believersy we are here to prove to be Savant that there is heaven Guru there is Holiness there is a God who is Holy that is the people what you are about to who are holy who follow the world who believe the world who live the life of the world according to his will okay there is a difference between knowing the words those are two things in Jesus [Music] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ being baptized name is okay it is good you have fulfilled the word of God that honorable yes foreign [Music] amen amen amen knowing the word living the life of the world so you must keep that in mind my sister amen so it is the one that will take us to Heaven that I believe one thing I know okay to live the life of the world together it's what is going to take us where we are going amen amen I spoke about the devil government when someone is working for the devil saluting and the devil reach a point of saluting someone can work for God the word tells us that when we shall reach there he shall also say welcome my Faithful Servants residual s who does not want to reach there praise God I have many things to put my name is now it's so pleased to go let me send Jesus on Earth praised him to represent him as an animal and that animal which was the lamb went back in the beginning the foreshadows of the coming of Jesus Christ God sacrifice in the foreshadows of the coming of God [Music] foreshadowing the coming of Christ and shedding the blood foreign foreign to bring forth a child and that is the blood of the beasts entered the human race foreign [Music] so innocent foreign [Music] [Music] was going to represent himself from Heaven he was represented presented humblest of the fools that fly in the heavens that is we are seeing two things here the alarm um the lamb and the dove nature they have the same nature is one is so Meek and gentle Netherlands the same Meek and gentle so represents the believer represent the Holy Spirit and now is one cannot be there without the other Indigo the ship in its Nation if it moves along it will stray yet the ship needs the dove it must be obedient to the dove a believer that is how I believe I supposed to be to be so obedient like that to the Holy Spirit who has ever seen the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit it has not work on other things he works on the ministers what I'm trying to say here is recognizing Holy Spirit in the man of God is I don't think I don't expect there is one day when he was Pastor stood here praise God Amen are we learning trigger are we listening to each other this is exactly what the Lord has put on my heart but to prove that we are lamps we must be listening we must be humble we must be followers we must seek the leadership of the Holy Spirit [Music] we must know the will of God what the Lord wants us to do the Lord wants us where the Lord wants us the Lord so we must be obedient spirits foreign amen Amina amen in the ark um that I was a dance and the death is represented in many places in the Bible it is the symbol of the Holy Spirit and the lamb is represented in many places of the Bible in Revelation all the way back to Genesis and in Genesis the devil therefore in the ark is sitting on the roost with the with the rest of the force of the air and one of them was a reverend yeah is one of the meanest Birds there is I guess is about the meanest bird that we can find is it okay now amen so when he's speaking about this Robin we are not just reading the story let us look at the nature of this first of all it was granted a privilege to enter into the ark wow are we together amen so it saw the suffering of the people how they were being killed everybody huh it learned nothing so no wonder the prophet is talking about it like them as as the ministry for the days passed all the people that interest and it left behind the place like we enter the air causes now let us assume that the act now is the message so we enter the message we understand the message we know the Mysteries to see how the world is going to end you'll have been single again to come and see the punishment that is called the oncoming judgments but then it is how Russia is going to punish Americans America we know what is happening in America Catholic President we have the sitting vice president who is a woman vice president something that was prophesied in 194 1933 before some of our grandparents were not yet born praise God Amen we know those things those are also Mysteries when those things happen we were just like reading the book this is what the prophet told us we learn nothing from me so I don't want us to take the nature of the Cross because we know what is going to happen on this world the only thing that is hindering those things to happen is the bride who is still here but wait foreign foreign that that the message was enter the act because you are in the ark but there is still a journey to go foreign [Applause] amen praise God Amen Mr Crow the flood is and the whole world was destroyed he want to know about serious whether people are serious are they believing or they came in the message just to hide from the tribulations just because they don't want to go to hell it is why they believe it's the message why did you believe the message because there is because you don't want to go to hell as if they told you uh that believing the message no I have bad news foreign and still get lost so there we must be seriously praise God Amen where the problem is when they send the crow outside go out there when he reached out there yeah okay he enjoys what was happening I didn't know my message I didn't know that being in the ark I've been oh it has been hidden from me the past is always happening ah yeah yeah [Music] yeah [Applause] so delicious life is sweet I didn't know no [Applause] umasses are so sweet see from the ark from chombo the dedicated says huh are you listening from the church of the message oh my today the character says to boys if it is not happening then I'm warning you it is going to happen but take the warning I mean if it is not happening if it is not happening then it is going to happen am I prophesying oh or what would that be over if it is not happening then it is going to happen uh so take that warning if it is not happening it is going to happen and if it is happening you are demanded to repent let's see you are advised to get on the editor or take advantage foreign [Music] [Music] repent ance [Music] praise God Amen I hope I'm speaking to someone yeah because kubanga why should one leave the message and enjoy the things of the world no human way between if you are not a crow provided God forgive you Mr Crow foreign [Music] but when we believed we believe when we decided we made a decision no one is going to decide for you again no one is going to stand for you again you are the one to stand for yourself you must stand on your convictions amen praise God Amen boys how long shall God wait for you how long shall he rebuke you said when you listen to today we are a Christian tomorrow you are a devil and Carol is Satan today you are a saint that you are in the church tomorrow you are in another life because you are before the pastor you have come here because the pastor will ask you why you have not come on you are not sinning it is not it is not out of your convictions because praise God Amen so do you fear God or you fear men or whatever praise God Amen that is the nature of a cruel foreign [Applause] ah uh this is a reverend crowded repent praise God so you can enjoy the things and remember that is the tricky point yeah so you say ogama ah maybe God is not looking at my sins because when we enter into the spirits I also enjoy the things you have to remember one thing this happened on Samsung and he started adultery but the power of God also to come on him after enjoying the woman yeah [Applause] [Music] yeah foreign just one more time give me my strength I will fight the enemy once that is what is lacking in us we don't have that that nature we have that naturally yeah we don't easily repent yeah when his hair was seven when his hair when they shove off his hair that is why I think he's prayed he said go yeah they have cut off my hair but one thing I pray hide it from them not understand again that it was it was here that brought to me the strength when he was working for them they didn't remember because that's why the strength for them to be clever as a celebrity [Music] he will praise God Amen yeah that is the resilience of a Believer praise God Amen his repentance what helped him he was repentant praise God Amen but now look at yourself that boy was born and
