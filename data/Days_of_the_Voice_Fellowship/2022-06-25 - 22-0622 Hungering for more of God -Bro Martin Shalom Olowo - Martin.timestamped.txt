[1:16] mouth and told them saying
[1:19] blessed are the poor in spirit for there
[1:23] is the king there is the kingdom of
[1:26] heaven
[1:27] blessed are they that mourn for they
[1:30] shall be confrated

[3:27] says the lord god
[3:29] that i will send a famine in the land
[3:32] not a famine of bread
[3:35] nor a thirst for water
[3:38] but of hearing the word of the lord
[3:41] and they shall wander from sea to sea
[3:43] and from north
[3:45] even to the east
[3:47] they shall run to and fro to seek the
[3:49] word of the lord and they shall not find
[3:52] it in that day shall the fear shall
[3:54] defeat violence and the young men
[3:57] trained for thirst
[4:23] [Music]
[4:46] father we thank you lord for the reading
[4:48] of the word
[4:51] it's my desire that you come and break
[4:53] this word unto us lord

[5:02] spirit speak through me tonight
[5:08] in jesus name
[5:10] amen i mean maybe

[5:26] that has given me uh an opportunity to
[5:29] stand before the bride of christ
[5:35] standing here it's never been easy
[5:50] and this is the only way god speaks to
[5:52] us
[5:56] the highest way god speaks to man
[6:04] let's
[6:08] [Music]
[6:33] you all the praises of the lord
[6:36] and this evening i want to talk uh i'm
[6:38] going to share about hungering for more
[6:41] of god
[7:02] here this word came from jesus himself
[7:05] from his own lips
[7:10] it says that blessed are they which do
[7:14] hunger and thurst after righteousness
[7:18] for they shall be filled
[7:25] with
[7:28] of the lord come blessings
[7:30] blessed are those who hunger
[7:35] and thus after righteousness
[7:40] shall be filled
[7:58] blessed by the name of the lord amen
[8:00] brother joel i request you to
[8:03] try to open that
[8:06] amen i mean
[8:08] so jesus himself
[8:10] yes
[8:11] in this chapter the bible tells us when
[8:13] the bible is
[8:14] saying that the multitude
[8:16] seeing the multitude he went up into um
[8:20] he went up
[8:21] into a mountain and when he was set his
[8:25] disciple came
[8:26] unto him and he opened his mouth and
[8:28] told them saying
[8:30] blessed are the poor in spirit for
[8:34] theirs is the kingdom of heaven
[9:05] things that started changing now the
[9:07] direction has started going different
[9:09] directions
[9:12] because majority followed him because of
[9:14] the miracles
[9:18] and the signs
[9:20] and the food
[9:33] yes
[9:46] unless you eat my flesh
[10:02] but
[10:02] tonight i want us to look at hungering
[10:06] for god
[10:09] they're living in the taste
[10:12] saw it by
[10:14] by the eyes of prophet samus
[10:31] [Music]
[10:33] [Applause]
[11:13] yeah if you turn in the opposite of that
[11:15] one
[11:21] according to you who does not hunger and
[11:23] that's for righteousness
[11:26] because
[11:33] [Applause]
[11:40] of god
[11:52] is
[12:09] amen just imagine you have that painful
[12:12] desire to hear the word of god
[12:18] that is how the church ought to be it
[12:20] cannot separate your way obey that
[12:22] blessing with
[13:01] [Applause]
[13:04] where is the problem
[13:06] it is because you are part with
[13:08] something different
[13:13] amen
[13:14] how can i get anger for god
[13:19] [Music]
[13:32] this evening
[13:42] [Music]
[14:26] is he the spirit of god in the spirit of
[14:28] the
[14:30] [Music]
[14:52] now the very reason that there is a holy
[14:55] spirit is
[14:56] because
[15:06] unless there was something in here to
[15:09] call for it out
[15:37] jesus is saying that blessed are those
[15:40] yes
[15:45] it means you can hardly find that
[15:49] um
[15:57] [Applause]
[16:16] go and cry before god
[16:34] holiness
[16:47] oh
[17:08] [Music]

[19:00] i remember we were with brother peter
[19:02] the other day truly tried in organ and
[19:04] peter and we met a brother that
[19:06] sentiment believe in fasting
[19:22] amen sometimes seeking god
[19:27] involved fasting
[19:30] isolation
[19:33] you locked yourself somewhere in the
[19:35] room nobody would carry
[19:50] he could go
[20:32] nobody
[21:01] [Music]
[21:27] of jesus christ telling the people that
[21:31] they don't need to fast
[21:33] i challenge them in the name of the lord
[22:10] he accepts my
[22:11] [Music]
[22:51] and strike their souls with the power of
[22:54] the
[22:57] resurrection prayer tonight that god
