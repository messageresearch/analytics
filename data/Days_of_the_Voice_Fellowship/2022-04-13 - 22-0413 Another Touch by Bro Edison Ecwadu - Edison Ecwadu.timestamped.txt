[11:12] [Music]
[11:18] and he took the blind man by the hand
[11:21] and led him out of the town and when he
[11:23] had spit on his eyes and put his hands
[11:26] upon him he asked him if he's so old
[11:29] and he looked up and said i see men as
[11:32] trees walking
[11:33] after that he put his eyes he put his
[11:35] hands again upon his eyes and made him
[11:38] look up and he was restored and he saw
[11:41] every man clearly
[12:15] [Music]
[12:50] pray
[12:52] you may be seated in the presence of the
[12:53] lord
[12:56] i must say this uh maybe before i start
[12:58] a senator
[13:01] may ah you people are falling victims of
[13:03] my love but
[13:27] praise the lord amen regardless of the
[13:29] distance
[14:00] i thank him so much for giving me this
[14:02] opportunity
[14:04] that i stand and speak to you
[14:07] it's something that the lord has put in
[14:08] my heart
[14:11] praise the lord come here now from where
[14:13] we've read one way too much
[14:54] [Music]
[15:24] he took jesus
[15:27] to lead us one by one
[15:30] take you by hand
[15:33] and lead you outside of the world
[15:36] praise the lord man
[15:38] when he led you outside of the world
[15:40] well yeah
[15:41] praise the lord man he brought you to
[15:43] salvation
[15:45] that was the first touch that he gave
[15:47] you
[15:51] because we were
[15:52] blind we were under the masses of jesus
[15:57] christ
[15:58] and it took obedience for us to obey
[16:03] we have not obeyed
[16:05] that we are not accepted to follow
[16:07] christ
[16:09] christ will not have anything to do with
[16:11] you and me
[16:13] nature
[16:14] why because he cannot deal with you in
[16:16] the world
[16:20] pick
[16:28] [Music]
[16:36] now let's think like this second floor
[16:38] is the recipe
[16:39] if that blind man oh mercedes
[16:42] whom jesus led uh outside of the town
[16:45] yes
[16:47] because he was not seeing jesus in the
[16:49] first place
[16:51] because he was blind
[16:54] but somebody was holding his name
[16:56] and he was walking by faith
[17:00] he didn't even tell him where he was
[17:01] taking it
[17:13] praise the lord tonight if this man had
[17:15] rejected jesus later
[17:22] praise the lord amen if he had insisted
[17:25] not to god see again
[17:27] if he had lost trust for jesus
[17:30] christ he said jesus
[17:43] do you think he would have gained
[17:44] decided
[18:12] you need
[18:27] amen you cannot discover the purpose of
[18:29] god in your life
[18:32] if you don't have a revelation for
[18:33] following him
[18:36] hallelujah
[18:38] christ demands obedience
[18:54] regardless
[19:20] things may not make sense in the
[19:21] beginning
[19:23] you may not understand the way things
[19:24] are going on in your life now
[19:27] but i'm here to tell you my sister my
[19:28] brothers
[19:30] one day things will make sense
[19:32] one day you will understand why things
[19:34] are going on in your life
[20:18] and the bible tells
[20:46] now that
[20:58] and refuse the call of jesus
[21:16] he knew this man was not actually seeing
[21:18] well emmanuel trump said you know
[21:19] he was not saying clearly
[21:21] because how do you see a man like a tree
[21:23] walking double chairman right now you
[21:25] see the trees as what can i tell you
[21:28] if you're seeing
[21:42] and that is the way we saw when we just
[21:44] came to salvation
[21:47] we were seeing men like trees walking
[21:50] so many things never made sense to you
[21:54] deep inside your heart
[21:56] your heart was
[22:01] [Applause]
[22:37] but you could not get satisfied with the
[22:39] world
[22:40] you knew something was wrong somewhere
[22:42] oh man you are the world where you are
[22:43] about anyhow you could not help yourself
[22:46] you didn't know what to do again
[22:48] you didn't know which path to take how
[22:50] many you covered oh my you were blind
[23:35] by faith
[23:36] you came as a catholic no you came out
[23:38] of that present protestant church
[23:41] you came out of the ph
[23:43] and you walked anyhow no america you
[23:45] didn't know where you were going
[23:47] you didn't know where you were going
[24:02] the leadership of god that he followed
[24:05] praise the lord amen he brought you in
[24:08] jesus hallelujah amen why don't we thank
[24:11] god

[26:35] you can see something better than the
[26:37] denomination
[26:40] it is not because you are better than
[26:42] them no
[26:42] by seeing god it is not because you are
[26:44] wonderful anything good no since your
[26:46] guaranteed children it is by the grace
[26:48] of god sisters
[27:03] of all those people that were out there
[27:05] brother and troubled
[27:06] he decided to grab your heart
[27:09] and then he led you outside of the world
[27:11] why did he forsake the rest of the body
[27:14] and then he picked you in particular
[27:17] one day
[27:18] the disciples
[27:32] you tell us the meaning of the parable
[27:35] jesus said yesterday oh i love this one
[27:38] listen to this
