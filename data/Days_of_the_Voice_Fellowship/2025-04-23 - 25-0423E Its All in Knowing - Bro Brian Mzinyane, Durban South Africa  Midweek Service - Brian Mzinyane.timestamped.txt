[53:44] invite my wife to come with my
[53:47] children. Let Pastor Brian see you
[53:50] before he
[53:53] preaches because he took time. He came
[53:56] all the way from South
[53:59] Africa to the wedding and then he
[54:02] returned. So it's a honor to have you.
[54:09] Amen. Amen. Praise
[54:13] God. Are they
[54:15] all? There must be more. Ah, okay.
[54:18] Others are sleeping. Okay.
[54:22] Amen. So you remember her, I'm sure.
[54:25] And I think you can say I've taken good
[54:27] care of her, right? Thank you. Thank

[54:31] So this is my first and then she
[54:33] comes comes next. Ah, okay. Okay. I'm

[55:19] Charles is hosting uh Pastor Brian
[55:25] you know, we got in touch actually with
[55:27] brother Brian and I was like, why don't
[55:29] you also pass us by
[55:33] and I'm so grateful to pastor Charles
[55:34] who made that arrangement and make it
[55:39] happen and I'd like him to maybe come
[55:42] and uh just greet
[55:46] us before we go into the other session.
[55:53] Amen. Please join me to welcome us.
[56:01] The Lord bless
[56:03] you. I'm
[56:06] Charles the pastor of the little flock.
[56:12] [Applause]
[56:14] Charles
[56:16] Amen. Uh I came with a team in
[56:21] Mica. Those who came on their own, they
[56:24] will introduce
[56:29] them. But I see others who came on their
[56:34] own from the little flock church.
[56:38] But the the team that came with
[56:41] me in my car
[56:43] was incidentally I'm also here with my
[56:48] wife. She's here.
[56:55] And then my
[56:57] daughter
[57:00] Mary daughter there plus pastor Brian
[57:05] Brian. So little flock church just your
[57:12] hand. Thank you so much.
[57:15] What I want I can always say like
[57:19] this
[57:22] pastor is my bosom
[57:26] friend
[57:28] and I know him because he has a heart
[57:31] for missionary work.
[57:39] evangelism. That's the area really God
[57:42] united
[57:45] me and I appreciated the way the Lord's
[57:48] used him
[57:51] mighty work in
[57:55] Ethiopia. I've just passed Ethiopia as I
[57:58] was going to West Africa by plane. I
[58:01] didn't I don't know much Ethopia.
[58:10] I know but from the reports he gives and
[58:14] so
[58:16] forth the Lord has used him as a
[58:22] special to spread the message of the
[58:26] hour in Ethiopia.
[58:30] And uh just now he was telling me the
[58:32] Lord led him now to come back here
[58:39] establish because that's what Jesus
[58:42] said in Acts chapter one
[58:44] verse 8. Jesus said that you shall
[58:48] receive
[58:50] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[58:53] you and you be my
[58:56] witnesses. Most people they don't read
[58:59] that scripture very
[59:01] well. They
[59:05] say he didn't say like that.
[59:08] He said boss in
[59:13] Jerusalem Jerusalem Judea Samaria
[59:18] to the uttermost
[59:19] part meaning that charity begins at
[59:25] home as they are preaching taking the
[59:28] gospel of Samaria
[59:29] [Music]
[59:31] wherever they must also be preaching it
[59:33] in Jerusalem.
[59:37] She must strengthen the foundation at
[59:41] home. You not able to reach other
[59:45] places. I appreciate that leadership the
[59:48] Lord
[59:50] you lay a foundation here at
[59:54] home that can enable you to reach
[59:59] out and uh I'm happy to be with you
[1:00:04] here and uh may the Lord bless
[1:00:08] you Jesus mighty
[1:00:11] name bless you thank you so
[1:00:14] much I've seen the blessings of the Lord
[1:00:17] through your
[1:00:20] family, but much more we want continue
[1:00:25] to
[1:00:29] collaborate because God has a missionary
[1:00:36] program. Amen. Uh these are men that uh
[1:00:41] have known me much earlier before I even
[1:00:43] got married.
[1:00:47] I remember the first time I met Pastor
[1:00:49] Charles was when with pastor the
[1:00:58] late we had some good
[1:01:02] fellowship. So I I we we thank God for
[1:01:04] the men that have stood for this
[1:01:07] message. Continue to spread
[1:01:10] it. You appreciate the message of the
[1:01:12] hour.
[1:01:15] Amen. God has many. He has planted them
[1:01:19] many
[1:01:20] blessings and um you know um there's
[1:01:23] something that pastor Charles
[1:01:26] said that we should continue to work
[1:01:31] together because you see one thing that
[1:01:33] I
[1:01:34] believe the brother and the sound really
[1:01:36] I want good sound so that the preacher
[1:01:38] will find it really good. Um so one
[1:01:41] thing that I believe
[1:01:44] that um when it comes to
[1:01:48] ministry there is no competition.
[1:01:52] Why? Because whoever God
[1:01:56] calls there is something special in
[1:02:00] him for someone
[1:02:04] special. And so we I can never be you,
[1:02:06] you can never be
[1:02:08] me. But each of us are a vessel in God's
[1:02:11] eyes.
[1:02:12] [Music]
[1:02:15] So we appreciate little flock
[1:02:17] church and pastor Charles for standing
[1:02:20] with this message.
[1:02:23] Amen. I want to invite my daughters to
[1:02:26] come and sing a song and and then as we
[1:02:28] invite the
[1:02:35] ministry. Amen. And there's a song they
[1:02:37] sung on
[1:02:39] Sunday and I was listening to it
[1:02:43] and uh it really blessed
[1:02:48] me. Yeah.
[1:02:57] God bless you all.
[1:03:05] We're going to sing the song that says,
[1:03:06] "Your grace and mercy." The
[1:03:12] chorus, your grace and
[1:03:16] [Music]
[1:03:20] mercy
[1:03:22] brought me through.

[1:11:35] Dear loving savior,
[1:11:37] we humbly come before your
[1:11:40] presence, Lord God Almighty.
[1:11:45] Your presence it means bring brings new
[1:11:49] hope. David says your loving kindness is
[1:11:52] better than life.
[1:11:56] Oh God, uh this tonight I
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:11:59] pray you open your deep things into your
[1:12:02] word. Oh
[1:12:04] God, so we can be well equipped as your
[1:12:07] children,
[1:12:09] Lord. We are living in an hour of great
[1:12:12] deception,
[1:12:14] Lord. But our hope and rest is upon the
[1:12:19] scripture. The elect will never be
[1:12:21] deceived.
[1:12:24] Father, bring us to your
[1:12:26] word. We didn't even know how to
[1:12:29] pray. Before the message
[1:12:32] came, didn't know what a minister
[1:12:35] was. I didn't know what to be a
[1:12:38] father. Lord, we thought any woman who
[1:12:41] can able to give children is a
[1:12:43] mother. But we realize, oh God, that
[1:12:46] motherhood is a
[1:12:48] character. Father, you taught us so
[1:12:51] much.
[1:12:53] And we are still teaching us by the day.
[1:12:55] Lord, we are humbling ourselves
[1:12:58] tonight. We say let him go and let God
[1:13:01] have his own
[1:13:04] way mystery. Oh
[1:13:07] God, Lord Jesus Christ, bless him
[1:13:10] richly.
[1:13:11] Lord, bless his family and children,
[1:13:15] Lord. Special honor and privilege to see
[1:13:17] how you've blessed them,
[1:13:20] Lord. Ethopia my
[1:13:23] father pastor Charles here my
[1:13:26] lord believers who are gathered
[1:13:29] here that's the great work these
[1:13:30] soldiers are doing
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:34] this if we are to spend our
[1:13:37] lives we desire to spend it in the house
[1:13:40] of doing the will of
[1:13:43] God no stone will be left upon another
[1:13:47] stone heaven and earth will pass
[1:13:50] way but your words will
[1:13:52] never bless us tonight those
[1:13:56] visible and
[1:13:58] invisible. We know your word knows no
[1:14:01] distance can reach out to
[1:14:04] anyone. I pray tonight that his courage
[1:14:06] must be
[1:14:08] encouraged. I pray that may be restored
[1:14:11] tonight. I pray the loss be
[1:14:13] found. I pray the sick may be healed
[1:14:16] tonight. I pray believer be anchored in
[1:14:18] the way tonight.
[1:14:20] Those who don't have the Holy Ghost,
[1:14:22] there's more than enough Holy Ghost.
[1:14:24] Father, whichever need there is, you
[1:14:27] supply according
[1:14:28] to the interpreter. Oh
[1:14:31] God, he does not know what to be said.
[1:14:33] Lord, it depends upon you, Lord. Not
[1:14:37] knowing the language, Lord, but it takes
[1:14:39] your
[1:14:40] grace. May I move one side, Lord. May
[1:14:44] the composer be the one going to speak
[1:14:45] to
[1:14:46] you. May the vessel of clay move
[1:14:49] once divine
[1:14:52] order. The one who knows every thought,
[1:14:54] every heart, the one who knows every
[1:14:56] life and
[1:14:58] of you take the subject tonight Lord and
[1:15:02] burn it upon our
[1:15:03] hearts to the
[1:15:05] tables. Holy Ghost break this
[1:15:08] word in Jesus Christ. We thank you. Amen
[1:15:12] and amen and amen. Amen.
[1:15:15] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Much has been
[1:15:17] said. Amen.
[1:15:20] I don't have
[1:15:21] uh soldiers and army like brother TMA
[1:15:27] has. I only got two
[1:15:30] warriors, Joshua and
[1:15:34] Caleb. They 11 months apart.
[1:15:40] They made it to the promised
[1:15:42] land. One is about 10
[1:15:50] 254. So they are just like that. They
[1:15:52] are 11 months
[1:15:56] apart. Very very wonderful children. God
[1:15:58] has blessed me
[1:16:00] with they are serving with me in the
[1:16:03] ministry. One is a prolific music
[1:16:06] player.
[1:16:08] Then he's on the guitar, then he's on
[1:16:10] the piano, then is this. He's very, very
[1:16:13] wonderful. The other one I think is a
[1:16:16] better preacher than
[1:16:18] me, which we thank the Lord for
[1:16:21] that. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:16:25] So, uh, may God bless you
[1:16:27] richly, one
[1:16:30] wife. Blessed be the name of the Lord. I
[1:16:33] thought you going to say, "Amen."
[1:16:36] It's important to say this is identify
[1:16:40] yourself. Not two, not three,
[1:16:47] not okay. Okay. Okay. Yes. Bless your
[1:16:51] hearts.
[1:16:53] Let's pick up a scripture here by the
[1:16:56] grace of God. I'll come here in the book
[1:16:59] of James later. Let's go to uh Genesis
[1:17:01] 3.
[1:17:04] Usually we just follow the spirit of the
[1:17:07] leading of the
[1:17:10] spirit under pressure with time. We
[1:17:12] respect
[1:17:14] that. Pastor notified me of a bit of a
[1:17:22] time. All right. God bless your heart.
[1:17:24] Praise the Lord. All right. That's
[1:17:27] better. Genesis 3.
[1:17:30] [Music]
[1:17:32] My my
[1:17:35] my pick up Genesis 3 here.
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:44] Perhaps uh yeah, let's pick up one. This
[1:17:46] says um um the verse 8.
[1:17:52] And they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:17:54] walking in the garden the cool of the
[1:17:56] day. And Adam and his wife hid
[1:17:59] themselves from the presence of the Lord
[1:18:01] God amongst the trees of the garden.
[1:18:17] [Music]
[1:18:18] And the Lord God called to Adam and said
[1:18:20] unto him, "Where are thou?" And he said,
[1:18:22] "I heard thy voice in the garden, and
[1:18:24] was afraid, because I was naked, and I
[1:18:26] hid myself." And said, he, "Who told
[1:18:29] thee that thou art naked? Has thou eaten
[1:18:31] from the tree whom I have commanded thee
[1:18:33] that thou shalt not eat?
[1:18:53] Verse 12. And the man said, the woman
[1:18:54] which thou gave me did with me and gave
[1:18:57] to me, and they did eat. And the Lord
[1:18:58] said unto a woman, what does thou has
[1:19:01] done? And the woman said, the serpent
[1:19:02] beguiled me and I did eat. And the Lord
[1:19:04] God said unto the serpent, because thou
[1:19:06] has done this thing, thou art care above
[1:19:08] all cattle, above every beast of the
[1:19:10] field, on thy belly shalt thou go, and
[1:19:12] dust thou shalt eat and the days of thy
[1:19:14] life. And I will put enemity between
[1:19:15] thee and the woman, and between thy seed
[1:19:17] and the seed. He shall bruise thy head,
[1:19:19] and shall bruise his head.
[1:19:28] in
[1:19:35] India. India
[1:19:53] Right. Let's go back to earlier verse,
[1:19:55] verse
[1:19:56] four. Let's go to the earlier verse,
[1:19:58] verse
[1:20:00] four. And the serpent said unto the
[1:20:02] woman, "Ye shall not surely die. And God
[1:20:05] doth know that in the day ye eat
[1:20:07] thereof, then your eyes shall be open,
[1:20:09] and ye shall be as God, knowing good and
[1:20:13] evil.
[1:20:28] God bless those of us who may take the
[1:20:35] comfort. God help
[1:20:38] us. May God grant us grace.
[1:20:42] And then um this subject by the grace of
[1:20:46] God us take some more more time on
[1:20:51] it we will try and by the grace of God
[1:20:53] and go how far as the Lord
[1:20:57] leads something here is
[1:21:00] happening but as
[1:21:02] believers as Christians we must
[1:21:05] understand the battle is
[1:21:07] raging it has been raging before Jesus
[1:21:12] That battle is between right and
[1:21:15] wrong, between God and Satan,
[1:21:18] righteousness and evil. You cannot have,
[1:21:21] you know, when you look at both of the
[1:21:24] sides. And then adultery is right is is
[1:21:27] a right act
[1:21:30] perverted. Are we together? So we're
[1:21:33] realizing that the enemy all the time is
[1:21:37] fighting against the principles of God.
[1:21:41] He's fighting against the the plan of
[1:21:45] God. But the enemy is not fighting out
[1:21:47] there too far
[1:21:49] away. He always want to be near and
[1:21:52] near for something to
[1:21:55] deceive. He must have part of the
[1:21:58] truth. To deceive as a part of the
[1:22:02] light. If it's too bright, light only
[1:22:05] can't deceive.
[1:22:08] to die only can't deceive. There must be
[1:22:10] a certain quality of
[1:22:12] both in order to
[1:22:14] deceive. Blessed be the name of God. So
[1:22:17] brother, sister, we are going to read a
[1:22:20] very uh amazing
[1:22:22] scripture in the book of James chapter
[1:22:24] 2. Let's go
[1:22:26] there and then we'll come back here.
[1:22:30] Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:22:33] And then let's start there on James
[1:22:35] chapter 2.
[1:22:45] Yeah.
[1:22:47] Yes. Just pick up 17. Even so faith it
[1:22:50] is that not works is dead be being
[1:22:57] alone. Yeah. A man may say, "Thou has
[1:23:00] faith, and I have works." Show me thy
[1:23:03] faith without works, and I will show you
[1:23:05] faith by my
[1:23:15] works. Now listen very well. Verse
[1:23:18] 19. Thou believest that there is one
[1:23:24] God. Thou doeth well.
[1:23:28] But the devils also believe and tremble.
[1:23:34] So it's not only you know enough to say
[1:23:37] I
[1:23:39] believe. Here's a scripture here. It
[1:23:42] says even demons they
[1:23:43] believe. They don't only believe they
[1:23:46] tremble because in the revelation they
[1:23:50] have knowing the oneness of God makes
[1:23:54] them
[1:23:54] tremble. Please brother and
[1:23:57] sister when he spoke about faith he took
[1:24:00] faith to another
[1:24:02] level by saying this everyone on earth
[1:24:05] has
[1:24:07] faith atheist who doesn't believe God is
[1:24:09] there is
[1:24:10] faith believers got
[1:24:13] faith believers got
[1:24:15] faith believers got
[1:24:17] faith you someone who doesn't go to
[1:24:21] church someone who doesn't read the
[1:24:24] Bible doesn't pray. He tells his
[1:24:28] girlfriend in the morning 5:00 you cook
[1:24:33] porridge I'll come with
[1:24:35] Kentucky and then he goes that guy
[1:24:38] doesn't read the
[1:24:39] Bible that guy doesn't pray doesn't go
[1:24:42] to church many people along the day they
[1:24:46] die they believe it's not going to be
[1:24:48] one of
[1:24:51] the is going to be the
[1:24:54] He's saying with
[1:24:56] what by faith losing
[1:25:00] faith you
[1:25:02] 5:00 yesterday we prayed so and so
[1:25:05] yesterday so and so believe
[1:25:12] himself I believe I have enough
[1:25:17] money we're going to
[1:25:19] enjoy
[1:25:22] tonight I get
[1:25:24] He's declaring the
[1:25:26] results. Many accidents along the road
[1:25:30] many through the
[1:25:31] day
[1:25:35] speaking. So you can't be an end time
[1:25:39] believer and just have
[1:25:43] faith. How many people climb a bike here
[1:25:48] in one biker takes you here, another
[1:25:50] one, another takes you there.
[1:25:53] People don't stop and say I want to go
[1:25:56] to
[1:25:57] Kambala and say let me see your
[1:26:01] license stand on feet let me
[1:26:05] see there are two things they
[1:26:08] got
[1:26:10] faithfully they believe he's got
[1:26:14] lesson knows where he's
[1:26:17] going by faith
[1:26:22] So are you seeing I'm trying to show you
[1:26:25] that for it will be an end time
[1:26:39] believers have
[1:26:41] faith believer in the
[1:26:45] word the prophet even take the faith
[1:26:50] Faith is a
[1:26:52] revelation comes to the church
[1:26:55] ages. He says revelation is more than is
[1:26:59] more important than the food you
[1:27:01] eat. Gives you prevailing
[1:27:05] power. When you got
[1:27:07] revelation, something
[1:27:09] opens, you act better. You start knowing
[1:27:13] better. You stand better because now
[1:27:16] revelations open up. We stand our Bible
[1:27:19] for many
[1:27:20] years. Many of the baptizing fathers and
[1:27:23] holy
[1:27:24] ghost when the message came open up the
[1:27:28] revelation. Many people said I'm born
[1:27:31] again. I'm born again. I'm born again.
[1:27:33] When the message came with a revelation
[1:27:37] we can distinguish who's born again,
[1:27:38] who's
[1:27:40] not. We thought someone going to church
[1:27:44] for
[1:27:45] us speaking word to the
[1:27:49] neighbor to the
[1:27:53] messenger was open when the word was
[1:27:56] open the
[1:27:58] whole new
[1:28:01] book opening
[1:28:03] up things we never saw before knowing
[1:28:07] things we never knew before realiz what
[1:28:12] we must become
[1:28:15] Come on, somebody say praise the
[1:28:17] Lord. I want to introduce the
[1:28:20] subject. It's all in
[1:28:24] knowing. Somebody say praise the
[1:28:27] Lord.
[1:28:28] All in knowing.
[1:28:32] You start writing in Genesis when God
[1:28:35] says don't eat of the
[1:28:37] fruit of the spirit on the garden
[1:28:40] because the day you eat you shall surely
[1:28:43] die. I want to show you
[1:28:46] something both
[1:28:48] sides. It takes a
[1:28:50] knowing and the word knowing is a very
[1:28:53] deep
[1:28:55] word. I'm going to come to that for a
[1:28:58] while. Somebody say praise the Lord.
[1:29:02] Oh, may God help us to break these
[1:29:03] things
[1:29:05] down. We really need grace in this
[1:29:09] hour. What? We need grace in this hour.
[1:29:14] Not everyone says I'm a message believer
[1:29:16] as a
[1:29:18] message. Imagine we must even design at
[1:29:20] that level. We must design at that
[1:29:25] level. It's all in knowing. It's all in
[1:29:27] knowing.
[1:29:31] Let's define it according to the Bible
[1:29:33] the
[1:29:36] dictionary. Awareness.
[1:29:38] Awareness through thorough observation.
[1:29:42] I'm defining the word brother knowing is
[1:29:45] is thoroughly what you call this is
[1:29:46] awareness through observation.
[1:29:55] inquiry of
[1:29:58] information. Develop a
[1:30:02] relationship with
[1:30:04] someone through meeting or spending some
[1:30:07] time with
[1:30:09] them. I'm saying this word as we unfold
[1:30:11] is taking different
[1:30:15] level. You can know something by just
[1:30:17] observing.
[1:30:19] know by inquiry, by
[1:30:21] information. There's another knowing by
[1:30:27] relation. Just go on meeting spending
[1:30:31] some time with someone. Be familiar and
[1:30:34] acquainted with a
[1:30:37] friend, recognizing
[1:30:41] someone or
[1:30:43] something. It's part of
[1:30:45] knowing something or someone
[1:30:49] It's part of knowing recognizing it's
[1:30:52] part of knowing serving is part of
[1:30:55] knowing relationship building part of
[1:30:58] you seeing this word taking deeper and
[1:31:01] deeper
[1:31:02] level depending on the context you're
[1:31:04] using
[1:31:07] it.
[1:31:09] Okay. You haven't caught it yet. Let's
[1:31:11] go. Genesis 41. Let's
[1:31:15] go. Let's go. things of God are
[1:31:18] spiritually designed. I tell
[1:31:21] you, there's no greater wisdom than the
[1:31:23] wisdom of
[1:31:25] God. Let's read Genesis 4:1.
[1:31:28] Adam knew his
[1:31:31] wife. She
[1:31:35] conceived every day, ever since the
[1:31:39] day Adam was
[1:31:41] operated. He knew this is my
[1:31:45] wife. Are
[1:31:48] we together? You knew this is my wife.
[1:31:50] She come from me. She even named her.
[1:31:54] She says that you are born of my
[1:31:56] bones. I shall call you woman because
[1:31:59] you came out of a man out of a man. He
[1:32:04] knew. But Genesis
[1:32:07] 4 there's a deeper knowing.
[1:32:13] Someone say praise the Lord.
[1:32:16] What type of a knowing is
[1:32:18] this? After there is a
[1:32:22] conception. Are you see what is
[1:32:24] happening here? There's a deep
[1:32:27] knowing. There comes a time
[1:32:34] where to
[1:32:36] Isaac
[1:32:38] died. And then the Bible says this when
[1:32:42] introduced now they break out to Isaac
[1:32:46] and when you put the
[1:32:48] veil was no more.
[1:32:51] Then they got inside the
[1:32:53] tent and Isaac was
[1:32:56] comforted of the breath of the
[1:32:59] month. Now right there is no more public
[1:33:02] affair.
[1:33:04] beg
[1:33:05] you through
[1:33:10] preaching
[1:33:16] now personally.
[1:33:20] In other words, there's no more
[1:33:23] crowds. We sing, we sing a
[1:33:26] song with
[1:33:28] God in a secret
[1:33:31] place in the spirit.
[1:33:34] Beholding his
[1:33:36] face
[1:33:38] power in this
[1:33:41] race to be shut.
[1:33:58] In a holy place, in the holies
[1:34:01] of a holy
[1:34:03] place because
[1:34:06] of a man was light in the
[1:34:09] candles in the second field. No man's
[1:34:12] light was
[1:34:15] operating. A man
[1:34:18] [Music]
[1:34:19] outside the same manner take it. Cross
[1:34:23] the first veil in the holy place. Cross
[1:34:26] the second
[1:34:28] veil. Cross the second veil in the hol
[1:34:32] of holies in the port of
[1:34:35] gold. Paul speaks of
[1:34:38] dead. When you take the mana inside the
[1:34:41] pot, put it in dirt in the shana glory.
[1:34:45] 5 years later, it's still fresh. 10
[1:34:49] years later, it's still fresh. No matter
[1:34:52] how
[1:34:53] long the prince
[1:34:59] of Blessed be the name of the
[1:35:02] Lord. Listen brother, sister, a certain
[1:35:06] revelation that Rebecca never had.
[1:35:09] The second revelation he never caught
[1:35:12] from many
[1:35:13] years is waiting for the tie when is
[1:35:16] with Isaac that revelation
[1:35:21] [Applause]
[1:35:23] started the message I can take you so
[1:35:26] far there must come a time when you have
[1:35:29] a personal relationship with your
[1:35:32] husband you must meet
[1:35:35] your God bless the
[1:35:38] God bless the message. God bless the
[1:35:40] people in the
[1:35:42] message ministry. But you must stop
[1:35:45] there. You must come to a place. You
[1:35:47] must know your husband
[1:35:49] deeper. It's all in knowing. It's
[1:35:57] all in
[1:36:01] knowing. Let's follow for a
[1:36:04] while. When the tent was shut,
[1:36:08] Then he knew Isaac. If Isaac had a
[1:36:12] certain spot on the right hand
[1:36:14] side, Rebecca started
[1:36:18] noticing on the right hand side. There's
[1:36:21] a market. Okay. Okay. Okay. There's a
[1:36:25] mark. All right. All right. Oh, there's
[1:36:28] a
[1:36:28] market. Okay. Is known because they shut
[1:36:33] in a secret place. He knows her. She
[1:36:37] knows him. They know each other from
[1:36:40] relation to
[1:36:45] revelation. Natural
[1:36:47] things always touch the
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:55] spiritual might not have
[1:36:57] known that this Isaac is a
[1:37:00] sport know.
[1:37:09] And later on there comes a repair.
[1:37:14] She's expecting a pain and there's
[1:37:16] trouble right here. There's no alza to
[1:37:19] us inquiring of the Lord. The Lord gave
[1:37:23] a revelation. There's two
[1:37:25] nations. I want you to notice if you can
[1:37:28] only stop at the
[1:37:30] messenger. You are in for it.
[1:37:35] Because the another unfolding
[1:37:38] happening another
[1:37:41] unfolding. Listen very carefully. Let me
[1:37:44] show you
[1:37:44] scripture. When they asked
[1:37:46] John, who are you? Never said a son of
[1:37:50] Zachariah. Mother Elizabeth, the cousin
[1:37:53] to
[1:37:54] Mary. Who are you? I'm the voice of the
[1:37:58] one who appointed a
[1:38:00] scripture that speaks about him
[1:38:03] preparing the way for the Messiah. When
[1:38:07] John came, he did exactly that. Behold
[1:38:11] the lamb of
[1:38:12] God of the world. After that, the Bible
[1:38:16] says the following day, the disciples of
[1:38:19] John followed Jesus. John never had a
[1:38:22] problem. He knew that was his ministry.
[1:38:26] went to the presence of
[1:38:27] God. After that, put in jail. After
[1:38:32] that, when he was
[1:38:34] sold, ask, "Go and ask
[1:38:37] Jesus, is he the Messiah, or must you
[1:38:40] wait for another?" Jesus never
[1:38:43] said, "Let's go and visit
[1:38:48] Johnan there. John, you're not really
[1:38:52] John." She's never even there. Scripture
[1:38:54] says he went to
[1:38:57] Jesus
[1:38:58] knew he must be about his father's
[1:39:00] business. John is finished with his
[1:39:02] business. He appointed the Messiah. Now
[1:39:05] the Messiah
[1:39:08] the must walk the dead must rise. All he
[1:39:12] said go and tell Jonah the dead are
[1:39:16] raised. The eyes are open. That's the
[1:39:18] only
[1:39:19] testimony to
[1:39:21] know right away. He killed Jonah.
[1:39:25] John his ministry was
[1:39:28] over. Where am I going with this?
[1:39:31] Malachi 4. He came and restored the
[1:39:35] order. The order was lost at the
[1:39:39] ages. He restored. Righteous minister
[1:39:43] restored. Put back the altar. He put
[1:39:46] back home to where it's supposed to be.
[1:39:48] Put church
[1:39:53] support mothers and father
[1:39:57] support to our senses the way I took
[1:40:02] amnia reminded us where we
[1:40:04] were introduced the capstone to
[1:40:07] us when he left the scene when he left
[1:40:10] the sin it's not over the beginning of
[1:40:14] the
[1:40:18] Hallelujah. When John was gone, who was
[1:40:21] there? The Messiah. When Malachi is
[1:40:24] gone, who's with us? The mighty one
[1:40:27] came. The mighty one came. He is the one
[1:40:31] who's here. Let's not lose our
[1:40:33] focus. We have to know. That's why
[1:40:36] you're not prenites. We're not worship
[1:40:39] of a man. Thank God for the
[1:40:41] man. We've got a knowing.
[1:40:44] We've got a knowing we know who we are
[1:40:48] and we know whom we have
[1:40:50] believed. Second Timothy chapter 1.
[1:40:52] Let's go. Second chapter 1. Let's
[1:40:56] go
[1:40:58] 12. Oh my Lord.
[1:41:01] Amen. Blessed be the name of the
[1:41:04] Lord. I keep on saying time is my
[1:41:08] enemy. The devil don't even regard him
[1:41:10] as as an enemy.
[1:41:13] That guy is
[1:41:14] finished. You can't worry about someone
[1:41:16] who's in ICU is
[1:41:21] unconscious. Don't resurrect him in your
[1:41:23] life. Don't resurrect the
[1:41:27] devil. Is well dealt
[1:41:31] with.
[1:41:34] Hallelujah. Oh, glory. I was telling the
[1:41:37] Christians a few days
[1:41:39] ago when he says, "How do you
[1:41:44] feel? You're feeling
[1:41:47] dizzy,
[1:41:49] stomach, you got a lot of
[1:41:51] problems. How do you feel, brother? Hold
[1:41:54] the mic this side. Hold the mic. Hold
[1:41:56] the
[1:41:58] mic. Brother, I'm blessed. I'm blessed
[1:42:01] and anointed, brother. How are you?"
[1:42:02] Amen.
[1:42:09] You don't call the business. You don't
[1:42:11] call other things. The enemy's eyes must
[1:42:14] close like this. The devil's eyes must
[1:42:16] close like this. I thought I finished
[1:42:18] him. I thought I dealt with him. But he
[1:42:21] says anointed. He says what is
[1:42:24] this revelation? It's revelation. You
[1:42:28] are not this flesh. You are not this
[1:42:30] flesh. You are what you are in the soul.
[1:42:35] in
[1:42:38] knowing somebody
[1:42:51] say blessed be the name of you love the
[1:42:54] Lord
[1:42:56] Jesus Paul says I know whom I've
[1:43:00] believed I know who I
[1:43:04] You have to know. It must come to a
[1:43:07] place. You know who you are.
[1:43:12] Not what the prophet believe, not what
[1:43:14] the pastors believe. What you believe,
[1:43:18] you must come to your
[1:43:19] place. When you go to
[1:43:21] university, you go with the pastor, you
[1:43:24] go with the deacon, you go with your
[1:43:27] soul. That's why you must know. That's
[1:43:30] why you must know. When you go your job,
[1:43:32] you don't care the pastor. You don't go
[1:43:34] with the deacon. That's why you must
[1:43:36] know. When you're doing business, you
[1:43:38] don't care the church. You go with your
[1:43:40] soul. That's why you must know whom you
[1:43:43] have
[1:43:44] believed. When you are criticized, when
[1:43:47] you are criticized in that hour, you
[1:43:50] must know who you believe. On certain
[1:43:54] arguments, is not meant to argue with.
[1:43:57] The codes are not there to argue.
[1:43:59] The codes are there to be
[1:44:04] lived. Somebody say
[1:44:08] present. Let's go to brother
[1:44:11] Job. Brother Job says this. Even though
[1:44:14] the skin worms may eat of my body in my
[1:44:18] own flesh, I shall see him. Listen what
[1:44:21] brother Job
[1:44:22] says. I know my
[1:44:27] redeemer. What made Job
[1:44:30] overcome? What made Job
[1:44:33] overcome is
[1:44:35] knowing? Hallelujah. Children are no
[1:44:38] more
[1:44:39] and then the field is
[1:44:42] [Music]
[1:44:43] bad. And then the boil all
[1:44:46] around. His breath is straight against
[1:44:48] his
[1:44:49] wife. His friends turn against him. They
[1:44:53] say you're a secret sinner.
[1:44:56] Everything around you was
[1:44:59] discouraging. You know where the
[1:45:01] strength
[1:45:02] was. It was in
[1:45:04] revelation of knowing who he is. He saw
[1:45:08] the resurrection. He saw the coming out
[1:45:10] of the dead. He saw King coming down. He
[1:45:14] shouted, "I know my redeemer lives. I
[1:45:19] know." He was saying, "I've got a
[1:45:21] revelation.
[1:45:24] All the boys may eat of me, but the boy
[1:45:26] can't touch my soul. The boys can't
[1:45:28] touch the seed. The boy can touch the
[1:45:31] feet of God. I am
[1:45:33] eternal. The word is eternal. I know.
[1:45:37] It's all in
[1:45:43] knowing. Somebody say, "Praise the
[1:45:45] Lord." Somebody say, "Praise the Lord."
[1:45:49] It's all in
[1:45:50] knowing.
[1:45:52] Imagine if 2025 was alive. If brother
[1:45:57] Brennham 2025 he was
[1:46:00] alive his email
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:06] inbox
[1:46:08] clogged people around the
[1:46:10] world skeleton
[1:46:13] faith any condition.
[1:46:28] God gave me a choice. Leave until you
[1:46:30] see the coming of the Lord or you go. He
[1:46:33] says, "I'm choosing to go. I'm afraid."
[1:46:37] Am I the only one to
[1:46:40] rapture so that we can grow in our
[1:46:43] faith? But we can know except
[1:46:46] personally.
[1:46:51] This is the
[1:46:53] paradox. When passed
[1:46:55] on, I came I became
[1:46:58] born. Hallelujah. So physically I don't
[1:47:01] know
[1:47:02] him. I heard the tapes. I read spoken
[1:47:06] words testimonies. But one day I had a
[1:47:09] privilege one time in a in so another
[1:47:11] place
[1:47:13] there and I found another
[1:47:15] grandmother. We went to testify in that
[1:47:20] home. And then we led that grandmother
[1:47:22] to Christ.
[1:47:24] And then she started saying wait a
[1:47:25] minute. We said William
[1:47:29] Brennham God sends a message. This is
[1:47:33] when I was young. I came here in close
[1:47:35] to I went to the meetings. I got
[1:47:39] healed. She got healed
[1:47:41] physically. Later on the seed
[1:47:45] son came and lead her to the
[1:47:49] Lord. The paradoxes that
[1:47:54] God a healing in the flesh. We thank God
[1:47:58] for it. But the best healing is the
[1:48:02] healing of the soul.
[1:48:04] [Music]
[1:48:06] Let me ask you a question. Did Lazarus
[1:48:08] die
[1:48:11] first? He
[1:48:13] died. Did he die
[1:48:16] again? As we speak now, he's waiting
[1:48:19] with
[1:48:22] Abraham. So any miracle in the
[1:48:26] flesh, there's no guarantee the
[1:48:28] condition cannot come again.
[1:48:32] Amen. But once saved, you are saved for
[1:48:36] time and pain. That is a quality you
[1:48:40] must never miss. That is a healing. You
[1:48:43] must never miss. You may miss the
[1:48:45] natural one, the spiritual one. Never
[1:48:48] miss that. Come to a place of say, I
[1:48:52] know I'm born again. I know I've got the
[1:48:56] Holy Ghost. I know I've got a theophony.
[1:49:00] I know I'm rapture bound. I know I'm
[1:49:03] dead in flesh. I know I'm the bride of
[1:49:06] Christ. The final voice is in
[1:49:09] me. It's all in
[1:49:15] knowing sons
[1:49:17] of some in
[1:49:20] 19. We assure you the name of Jesus of
[1:49:26] Paul
[1:49:28] demon Paul
[1:49:31] we know Jesus
[1:49:36] we but
[1:49:39] worthy. Amen. So even coming to demons
[1:49:43] you must identify
[1:49:44] yourself. In coming to demons they must
[1:49:47] know the real you.
[1:49:49] into demons. He must know the seed in
[1:49:52] you. He must know your position. He must
[1:49:55] know your revelation. He must know your
[1:49:57] anointing. He must know who you are.
[1:49:59] Paul, we know Jesus will know.
[1:50:03] When they come to you, same demons, they
[1:50:06] must say the same. Penelope, we know.
[1:50:10] John, we know we know we know must come
[1:50:14] to your place. He must recognize who you
[1:50:17] are without saying a
[1:50:21] word. He must know who you are. He must
[1:50:25] recognize the revelation in your heart.
[1:50:28] Revelation in your heart. They must know
[1:50:31] the same one who kicked them out of
[1:50:33] heaven has become flesh in 2025.
[1:50:38] in Uganda Uganda same must
[1:50:42] know same power same anointing same
[1:50:46] manifestation same
[1:50:51] same you know the way revelation is so
[1:50:55] important some they say just play the
[1:50:59] tape stay home play the tape I agree
[1:51:04] okay play the agree
[1:51:07] agree
[1:51:09] 100%. Don't just the tape. Listen to
[1:51:13] what the tape say. Get a revelation what
[1:51:15] the tape say. After you've listened to
[1:51:17] the tape, the tape will say, "God
[1:51:21] forsake the gathering
[1:51:26] together. That's the tape. That's the
[1:51:29] tape. The tape doesn't allow you to stay
[1:51:31] home and not come to church. The tape
[1:51:35] says gathering together of
[1:51:37] brethren. That's the
[1:51:40] tape. Somebody say praise the
[1:51:42] Lord. The tape
[1:51:45] recognizes that the only ministry that
[1:51:48] God has is not his. Brother, they ask me
[1:51:52] a question.
[1:51:53] Question. Will the bride have a
[1:51:57] ministry? Yes. Even now, it says a
[1:52:01] five-fold ministry. It's on tape. It's
[1:52:05] on tape. So if you don't recognize the
[1:52:08] five ministry, don't believe the very
[1:52:10] tape. We don't believe the radio message
[1:52:13] because the tape and please five minutes
[1:52:17] five minister
[1:52:22] them play the tape. Come
[1:52:27] play. Thank you. I love that
[1:52:30] place. Closer to that place.
[1:52:33] You must have the right
[1:52:35] attitude. Keep no grudges for nobody.
[1:52:38] Keep no grudges, brother, for nobody.
[1:52:40] That's what the tape says. The more you
[1:52:43] keep yourself humble, the more God can
[1:52:46] use you. The more the tape. These things
[1:52:49] are on the tape. I'm showing you what
[1:52:51] the tape
[1:52:53] says. Staying home with the
[1:52:56] stuff. I stay with the prophet. I say
[1:52:59] what the tape says. You're deceived.
[1:53:02] You're deceived. You're deceived. The
[1:53:05] tape didn't stop
[1:53:06] there. The tape says when a brother
[1:53:10] draws a
[1:53:11] circle, I draw I
[1:53:14] draw. I draw a big one
[1:53:17] first. And I draw you in
[1:53:20] first. You're my brother first.
[1:53:27] me me I only fellowship with those who
[1:53:29] listen to the tape at
[1:53:31] home those who believe my
[1:53:33] doctrine those who believe the wayh
[1:53:36] that's not in the tape that's not what
[1:53:38] the tape says that's not what the tape
[1:53:41] says the Bible says love your
[1:53:44] enemies to preach a message the 11th
[1:53:49] commandment the 11th
[1:53:51] commandment says if we want our churches
[1:53:54] If we want our churches to progress
[1:53:58] faster, let's go back to the first
[1:54:01] principle. Love
[1:54:03] first. Before
[1:54:05] prophecy, love first. Before preaching,
[1:54:08] love first before anything
[1:54:11] manifestation first and our churches
[1:54:14] will progress
[1:54:16] faster. That's the formula from Malachi
[1:54:19] 4. That's the formula from the tapes.
[1:54:23] Stay with the tapes. Say what the tape
[1:54:25] says. Don't stop there. Do what the tape
[1:54:28] says.
[1:54:31] [Applause]
[1:54:32] It's all in
[1:54:35] knowing. Somebody say, "Praise the
[1:54:37] Lord." Somebody say, "Praise the
[1:54:42] Lord." I know. Somebody say, "Praise the
[1:54:46] Lord." Samuel chapter 3. I read the
[1:54:50] Bible says this. Samuel was in the
[1:54:52] temple
[1:54:53] sleeping. He's got his priest
[1:54:55] early. A voice come from God. Samuel
[1:54:59] wake up. He goes to the priest
[1:55:02] early. Don't blame
[1:55:05] someone. Don't blame someone. Why is
[1:55:08] going to the
[1:55:09] prison? Cuz he
[1:55:11] knows. That's
[1:55:13] right.
[1:55:15] Amen. That's right. You can't just say
[1:55:17] speak my lord.
[1:55:21] Yet you don't know the
[1:55:24] Lord. We're too
[1:55:26] early. Must have called
[1:55:29] me. Go and sleep. Go and
[1:55:34] sleep. He wakes up. He goes back
[1:55:40] to he knows
[1:55:43] God. It's all in knowing.
[1:55:47] Then Ellie realized
[1:55:49] oh God is calling the
[1:55:51] boy. Next time the voice comes to say
[1:55:55] speak my lord. The servant is listening.
[1:55:58] Then the third time where he
[1:56:01] says he's no more going to end
[1:56:04] a instruction from
[1:56:08] me. He says speak my
[1:56:11] lord. Then he started giving me the
[1:56:13] revelation. I like the next verse.
[1:56:17] It says Samuel
[1:56:19] did not know the
[1:56:21] Lord. Let's read
[1:56:24] gospels. I like these things. They
[1:56:27] here as a preacher. I want you to see
[1:56:29] them
[1:56:30] yourself. Some scriptures is worth
[1:56:34] reading. Sure. My God. Listen. Not that
[1:56:38] any scripture is not worth reading. They
[1:56:40] all worth
[1:56:42] reading. You must clean your Bible. You
[1:56:44] must know your Bible.
[1:56:47] I don't hear an
[1:56:49] amen. It's good to clean the
[1:56:52] table, but you must know your Bible in
[1:56:55] and
[1:56:56] out. When when he says, "Let's go to the
[1:56:59] book of
[1:57:01] Jude." Don't start on
[1:57:07] revelation. We looking for
[1:57:11] truth. The whole until he read the
[1:57:13] scripture, he finishes.
[1:57:17] You come to
[1:57:19] Malachi
[1:57:21] Matthew says now let's go to let's go to
[1:57:25] you haven't found
[1:57:26] truth let's go to you stop and look
[1:57:30] up maybe the pastor made a
[1:57:36] mistake I've never heard like that it's
[1:57:40] in your Bible you must know your Bible
[1:57:44] [Applause]
[1:57:47] Imagine if you don't know where truth
[1:57:50] is. When are you going to do what is in
[1:57:54] truth? When will you start doing what is
[1:57:56] in truth? When you don't even know where
[1:57:58] truth
[1:57:59] is. It's all in knowing. You must be the
[1:58:03] word must dwell in you
[1:58:04] riches. We have to. We have
[1:58:07] to the seven seal
[1:58:09] book seven church 8 book the Hebrew
[1:58:12] message is the church part is not for
[1:58:16] brothers
[1:58:17] alone sisters must read the same
[1:58:27] book when
[1:58:30] children what what
[1:58:33] you're going to see spoke one
[1:58:34] day one
[1:58:36] You become a brother spiritual
[1:58:44] spiritual
[1:58:47] one waiting for you to come back to
[1:58:49] mother
[1:58:51] earth. We here we are
[1:58:53] hungry we here we need something

[1:58:58] carob and the
[1:59:01] angels we need you here.

[1:59:11] throne. The rain were around the

[1:59:19] foundation. You are so
[1:59:21] spiritual. Daddy, we wait for you after
[1:59:25] those hungry.
[1:59:30] The thing I'm saying is this. The family
[1:59:33] must be brought in the order of the
[1:59:34] spiritual. We must all serve the Lord
[1:59:36] and come up higher. Come up higher. Read
[1:59:39] the word. Fast and praise. Come up
[1:59:41] higher as a family. The Lord with
[1:59:48] revelation. Brother says, "Where is
[1:59:51] those overnight prayer
[1:59:54] meeting? Where at home?"
[1:59:58] Read your spoken
[2:00:18] respect. I'll have a serious service. I
[2:00:22] would have a serious service.
[2:00:32] Now brother Josh open in
[2:00:35] prayer. Mommy is sitting there.
[2:00:37] Amen. He said we're going to call the
[2:00:40] minister their own

[2:00:54] service. I open and read the spoken
[2:00:57] serious. I call the scripture serious
[2:01:00] and we say it's a prayer meeting. Let's
[2:01:02] all kneel
[2:01:04] down. No wonder they are the boys they
[2:01:07] are today. It's not magic. It's not
[2:01:09] magic. It's not magic. It's not magic.
[2:01:13] It's in knowing. You plant the seed. The
[2:01:16] Holy Ghost water the seed. He'll bring
[2:01:19] the
[2:01:20] harvest of praise.
[2:01:23] [Applause]
[2:01:28] Somebody say praise the Lord.
[2:01:46] I was enjoying benefit of
[2:01:52] the blessed love
[2:01:59] Jesus. It's all in
[2:02:02] knowing. Let's move this quicker.
[2:02:05] You come in the New Testament,
[2:02:08] blessed be the name of the Lord.
[2:02:10] Jesus. He knew who he was.
[2:02:14] No wonder they call him
[2:02:16] poop. He was not moved. They call him a
[2:02:19] Samaritan. You were a
[2:02:22] devil. We know your brothers and I come
[2:02:25] from a capital family. He says, "I I
[2:02:28] work as far as
[2:02:30] this. I do my father's work. I do
[2:02:33] nothing except my father's se. What I
[2:02:36] see is what I do.
[2:02:38] Are we together believers? There must
[2:02:40] come a time when the God you
[2:02:44] worship must be in you.
[2:02:47] [Music]
[2:02:49] Going to read the message.
[2:02:53] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord. There
[2:02:55] was a time the mercy
[2:02:58] seat was in the first
[2:03:01] tabernacle beyond the second
[2:03:03] veil. The priest must bring a bullock
[2:03:07] [Music]
[2:03:08] for his
[2:03:09] sins. Sins of
[2:03:11] Israel. There was a time a sinner must
[2:03:15] bring a
[2:03:16] lamb. The priest must inspect the
[2:03:18] lamb. He's not inspecting the
[2:03:21] worshipper. He's inspecting the lamb.
[2:03:24] The lamb must not have one eye. The lamb
[2:03:27] must not be crippled. The lamb must have
[2:03:29] no
[2:03:30] deformity. Why was this important? Even
[2:03:33] if the worshipper is limping, the priest
[2:03:37] is not looking at the limping. He's
[2:03:39] looking at the lamb. What must be
[2:03:41] blameless is the lamb. When he sprays
[2:03:44] the lamb, he washes the lamb. He cares
[2:03:48] the lamb. He offers the lamb. The
[2:03:52] worshipper must know the life that is
[2:03:55] living
[2:03:56] this. It was supposed to be my
[2:03:58] life. Is standing on my
[2:04:01] behalf. So the worshiper goes away not
[2:04:05] condemned because that animal died
[2:04:08] in somebody say praise the Lord.
[2:04:12] When and
[2:04:15] Herodot and Herod
[2:04:18] were confronted with the Lord Jesus
[2:04:20] Christ. What are you going to do with
[2:04:22] this Jesus called
[2:04:23] Christ? They had to decide
[2:04:26] individually. They want popularity.
[2:04:29] They want the people to to say they are
[2:04:32] wonderful or they stayed with the word
[2:04:34] before them. They chose to stay with the
[2:04:37] crowd. That's one. Secondly, and then
[2:04:41] there it is. Are you the Messiah? Are
[2:04:44] you the king of the Jews? Hey, this man
[2:04:46] is quite say anything. Christ was
[2:04:49] thinking about
[2:04:51] scripture as a lamb sent to a slaughter
[2:04:55] head. All he was concerned
[2:04:57] about is fulfill the word. He knew who
[2:05:00] he was. He did not need a Herod
[2:05:04] or he knows who he is.
[2:05:10] A dream
[2:05:12] came have nothing to do with that man of
[2:05:16] God. The
[2:05:18] law the wife. The wife.
[2:05:22] Yeah. And then the law according to the
[2:05:25] law
[2:05:27] blameless three perfection. The
[2:05:29] witnesses that he brought they were
[2:05:32] found to be
[2:05:33] false. So he warned against
[2:05:36] witnesses the law and
[2:05:38] blameless. There's another testimony of
[2:05:40] a dream from a woman supernatural. His
[2:05:42] own wife his own
[2:05:43] wife. God rich in mercy. He'll bring the
[2:05:47] truth to your doorstep.
[2:05:50] They had to
[2:05:51] decide before he can say situate
[2:05:54] yourself. He had to decide. Here are
[2:05:58] three avenues. They are all proving the
[2:06:01] lamb is guiltless.
[2:06:06] What must I do with this Jesus Christ?
[2:06:09] Must I give
[2:06:10] you the thief or give you Jesus? They
[2:06:14] say away with this
[2:06:16] man. give
[2:06:17] us the modern thinking
[2:06:21] today of Tik Tok
[2:06:25] likes jokes more than the things
[2:06:30] of tick tock tick tock tick
[2:06:33] tock tick tock tick tock when are you
[2:06:36] going to know what you're supposed to
[2:06:38] know because what you're supposed to
[2:06:40] know is not in Tik Tok what you're
[2:06:42] supposed to know is in the tapes what
[2:06:44] you're supposed to know must be in the
[2:06:46] hearts
[2:06:47] Don't be derailed by these things. Satan
[2:06:50] is creating
[2:06:55] amusement. Let me drop something to you.
[2:06:58] You know some
[2:06:59] sermons have got a shelf
[2:07:02] life sell by
[2:07:05] date when a minister can come. According
[2:07:08] to this event, according to that
[2:07:11] scenario, Christ is coming
[2:07:15] [Music]
[2:07:16] 24 April 3:30 in the afternoon, the
[2:07:21] rapture will go. We don't
[2:07:23] dispute, we just
[2:07:25] count
[2:07:27] 23 24 hours
[2:07:29] later. According to the
[2:07:31] sermon, we are watching tomorrow. 24
[2:07:36] 1:00 we are watching 2:00 we are
[2:07:40] watching 3:00 5
[2:07:43] 3 must phone the preacher we must phone
[2:07:46] the preacher preacher is you still there
[2:07:50] says yes I'm around you still on mother
[2:07:52] earth that means it's either two things
[2:07:56] it's either me and you missed the
[2:07:59] rapture or yourself you deceived
[2:08:02] yourself because It's 5 3 now 24th of
[2:08:06] April. You said will come 3:00. I didn't
[2:08:09] wait an hour because God never miss a
[2:08:13] month. I want to know did you make it to
[2:08:15] the rapture yourself? If you still
[2:08:17] answer me in this
[2:08:18] dimension I doubt if you raptured
[2:08:22] yourself. What am I trying to bring?
[2:08:25] Don't listen to all these
[2:08:29] fables. The Lord is going to come like
[2:08:31] this. Come
[2:08:33] on. Come
[2:08:35] on. Don't listen to all
[2:08:38] things. You stay ready in your heart.
[2:08:42] Make sure you know what you're supposed
[2:08:43] to
[2:08:46] know. I'm not going to heaven to meet a
[2:08:49] dead in
[2:08:50] heaven. I'm going to heaven as
[2:08:54] dead. I'm going to heaven as dead. I'm
[2:08:58] not going to meet that there. I am going
[2:09:01] to heaven as dead. Everyone is lying and
[2:09:05] knowing who I
[2:09:07] am. Let me read it for you. Let me read
[2:09:10] it for you. Somebody say, "Praise the
[2:09:15] Lord." Pastor, how can you say, "How can
[2:09:17] you call yourself dead?" Yeah, I called
[2:09:19] myself.
[2:09:21] If you are a sinner, save by grace is
[2:09:22] your
[2:09:26] business. Jesus when he was on the
[2:09:29] cross.
[2:09:32] thinking I don't care about the pain of
[2:09:35] the
[2:09:38] bleeding the nail on
[2:09:40] my
[2:09:54] nail. They cast a lot through my
[2:09:56] garments.
[2:09:58] They did this. Oh. Oh, one film that has
[2:10:01] been
[2:10:03] fulfilled. Then he cried, I
[2:10:07] first
[2:10:15] thought. You know the things of God, the
[2:10:17] way they so deep and
[2:10:18] spiritual. Why? Why there was a sour
[2:10:24] vinegar? Why was sour vinegar? close.
[2:10:29] Why? Because the scripture says they
[2:10:31] gave him sour feeling. It was supposed
[2:10:33] to fulfill the
[2:10:34] word. Even unbelievers, they anointed in
[2:10:37] fulfilling the
[2:10:39] word. They will fulfill the word whether
[2:10:41] they like it or
[2:10:44] not. He thinks he's mocking
[2:10:52] him. Then he said, "It is finished."
[2:10:56] Not I'm finished. Come on now. Not I'm
[2:10:59] finished. It is finished. Not I'm
[2:11:02] finished, but it is finished. I'm sorry,
[2:11:05] my
[2:11:06] brother. Not I am finished. But it is
[2:11:09] finished. Death has met the master.
[2:11:12] Sickness has met the master. Gra has met
[2:11:14] the master. Sin has met the master.
[2:11:17] Disease has met the master. Depression
[2:11:19] has made the master. Suicide has met the
[2:11:21] master. It is f.
[2:11:26] It's all in knowing.
[2:11:29] Somebody say, "Praise the Lord." Jesus
[2:11:32] knew who he is.
[2:11:34] I
[2:11:36] know. My God. Let me read
[2:11:42] it. Paragraph
[2:11:45] [Music]
[2:11:47] 80. Oh, we love you, Jesus.
[2:11:51] How is he knowing? When you know, when
[2:11:53] you know, when you know, let them mock
[2:11:55] and say what they say. When you know who
[2:11:57] you are, you're not shaken and moved.
[2:12:00] They can call you whatever names. But if
[2:12:02] you know who you are, you start dancing
[2:12:04] a preach. Hallelujah. You start dancing
[2:12:08] a whom you believed. Somebody say,
[2:12:11] "Praise the Lord."
[2:12:14] Why is he shouting like that? Is he mad?
[2:12:17] Why is he mad? In the way you call
[2:12:20] heresy. That's why I worship the God of
[2:12:22] my
[2:12:24] father. It's all in
[2:12:27] knowing. Somebody say praise the
[2:12:31] Lord. I love you
[2:12:34] Jesus. Let me read this
[2:12:37] quotation. South Africa is waiting for
[2:12:40] me. It's been wonderful being in Uganda
[2:12:44] and a wonderful part of people.
[2:12:47] Praise the Lord.
[2:12:50] Deity is not in heaven. Paragraph 8, I'm
[2:12:53] reading. Deity is not in heaven. That
[2:12:58] same power,
[2:13:00] that same Christ,
[2:13:02] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. The
[2:13:04] fundamentalists, let them people who
[2:13:06] deny the power of
[2:13:07] God say it's wrong. But that same power
[2:13:11] that spoke the
[2:13:14] word is in those people that got the
[2:13:17] Holy Ghost. If you have the Holy Ghost
[2:13:20] tonight, the power that says, "Let there
[2:13:24] be not far from here. It's in this
[2:13:27] building. It's in you. I got news for
[2:13:31] you. I got news for you. The same word
[2:13:34] that says the waters bring forth
[2:13:37] animals. The
[2:13:39] whale was created by the spoken
[2:13:43] word and the power of the spoken
[2:13:46] word created the whale. When you have
[2:13:49] the Holy Ghost today, it's in your
[2:13:53] heart. Spoken word, creative
[2:13:58] power. Let me help all the believers
[2:14:00] even those who are in
[2:14:03] online. A
[2:14:06] doctrine will never make you
[2:14:09] victorious. A doctrine won't make you
[2:14:13] victorious. A doctrine won't put you to
[2:14:16] the
[2:14:17] rapture. But God's quickening
[2:14:20] power. God's quickening power. The one
[2:14:23] that opened the seven seal. The one that
[2:14:26] raised Jesus from the dead. Jesus was
[2:14:28] not raised by he was raised by quicking
[2:14:31] power. He says because I live
[2:14:34] you live also. Not because I preach the
[2:14:37] rights of God, because the power that
[2:14:40] created Genesis raised me from the dead.
[2:14:44] I therefore declare you are raised from
[2:14:47] your sin
[2:14:49] and
[2:14:51] witchcraft is got no more holding in
[2:14:55] you. What is a witch called in Uganda?
[2:14:57] Witch a doggo. A doggo. Yeah. All the
[2:15:00] dogos in
[2:15:02] Uganda no
[2:15:04] more. You don't worry about
[2:15:07] dogos. The chief and the chief of the
[2:15:09] dogos is under your feet. The chief of
[2:15:13] the dog is under the feet. So you must
[2:15:16] dance. You must remember when you dance
[2:15:20] you suppressing the dog.
[2:15:23] Somebody say praise the Lord.
[2:15:27] Don't walk around opening the door
[2:15:28] there.
[2:15:30] I wonder if there's
[2:15:33] no if there's wet on the
[2:15:36] floor. Why
[2:15:40] is under your feet? Get out there and
[2:15:45] [Applause]
[2:15:50] walk under your feet. You're a daughter
[2:15:52] of God. You are a son of God. You know
[2:15:55] who you believed.
[2:15:58] Hallelujah.
[2:16:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He says this.
[2:16:06] That's right. Men and women.
[2:16:10] It's time we found out who you
[2:16:14] are. It's all in knowing. It's about
[2:16:17] time. You found out. Not who is not who
[2:16:22] followers, who you are. Are you getting
[2:16:25] it? Are you getting it now?
[2:16:28] The pastor is
[2:16:30] anointed. The is anointed. The prophet
[2:16:33] is anointed. The apostle is anointed.
[2:16:36] The teacher is anointed. You must know
[2:16:39] you're also
[2:16:42] anointed. Every son and the daughter of
[2:16:46] God is anointed with a special
[2:16:48] anointing.
[2:16:52] How how do you read John one?
[2:16:55] In the beginning was the word. The word
[2:16:57] was and the word was God and the word
[2:16:59] was made flesh. As much as they were led
[2:17:02] by the spirit of God, they were called
[2:17:05] who? Sons
[2:17:09] of spirit of God dwelleth in us. Word of
[2:17:14] God dwelleth in us rich. It makes us
[2:17:18] what? Deity in flesh.
[2:17:22] It's about time. We found out who we
[2:17:26] are. The devil is trying to hide you
[2:17:30] better. That's his job. He says, "Ah,
[2:17:33] sister hope is
[2:17:35] spiritual." But no, sister
[2:17:39] faith when we say believer, we speak
[2:17:41] about that
[2:17:43] sister. Don't
[2:17:45] believe him. Tell him I am wonderfully
[2:17:50] and fearfully made. Tell the devil, I am
[2:17:54] wonderfully fearfully
[2:17:57] made. You know who you
[2:18:00] are. I want to get the
[2:18:03] believers. This thing of terrifying by
[2:18:05] other people. They say I'm a witch. They
[2:18:06] say I'm a
[2:18:10] [Music]
[2:18:12] hypocrite. When they call you names,
[2:18:17] [Laughter]
[2:18:22] Hallelujah.
[2:18:26] What's wrong,
[2:18:27] brother? I'm so
[2:18:29] sad. And they call me
[2:18:32] president. They say me, all the devils
[2:18:34] in Uganda, all the devils in Uganda,
[2:18:36] they
[2:18:37] report. I'm the boss of the Ugandan
[2:18:41] government. A brother knows his story.
[2:18:58] You're a son of
[2:19:00] God. What's wrong with you? What's wrong
[2:19:03] with you? You're a son of God. There's
[2:19:05] nothing greater than being a son of God.
[2:19:08] Not even an angel. Not even an angel.
[2:19:11] You are higher above angel. One day you
[2:19:14] you charge angels, you charge demons. So
[2:19:16] what's wrong with you? Shake. Come on,
[2:19:18] man. Come back your
[2:19:23] senses. Hallelujah.
[2:19:26] I'm going to knock again. Come on. Come
[2:19:28] in. Good evening, brother. How do you
[2:19:30] feel? I'm superb and
[2:19:36] blessed. That's what I'm talking about.
[2:19:38] Praise be to God.
[2:19:41] We have to know who we are. Our victory,
[2:19:45] our victory is lying and knowing who we
[2:19:49] are. Our victory is knowing
[2:19:52] deeper. Know grace deeper. Let Christ
[2:19:56] know you deeper. It's all in the
[2:19:58] knowing. We must bring for children like
[2:20:02] Jesus. Can somebody say praise the Lord?
[2:20:06] [Applause]
[2:20:10] Woo! Let me finish this quote and leave
[2:20:12] you now. The devil is trying to hide you
[2:20:14] back, tell you that you are some little
[2:20:17] cow. You are
[2:20:19] not. You are sons and daughters of
[2:20:23] God. It is not in
[2:20:25] heaven. It's in
[2:20:27] you. Someone say it's in you. Say it's
[2:20:31] in me.
[2:20:38] Ah, this is Let's say it. Let's say
[2:20:45] it.
[2:20:46] [Applause]
[2:20:49] Amen. Deity is not in
[2:20:52] heaven. Deity is in me.
[2:20:57] [Music]
[2:21:00] I must get this one. Hallelujah. I like
[2:21:02] it. It's so anointed. I like
[2:21:05] it. Deity is not in
[2:21:07] heaven. It's in you. Let's say it's in
[2:21:11] me. Say it. It's in
[2:21:14] me. Don't worry about Satan. I want I
[2:21:16] want Satan to share this. I want the
[2:21:19] demons to share this because after the
[2:21:21] service, they're going to come in the
[2:21:23] week to you and say, "Yeah,
[2:21:27] What did you say in church? You must
[2:21:29] repeat and say maybe you didn't hear
[2:21:31] church. I'm going to say it again. There
[2:21:34] it is in me. When he come Friday,
[2:21:38] when Satan come Friday, come on,
[2:21:40] brother. Come Friday, tell him again.
[2:21:44] You didn't hear Wednesday. You didn't
[2:21:46] hear yesterday. I'm telling you again.
[2:21:51] Somebody say praise the Lord. Somebody
[2:21:54] say praise the Lord. Hallelujah.
[2:21:57] Satan. Now we can all say, "Bring it on,
[2:22:01] Satan. We are ready for you." Somebody
[2:22:04] say, "Praise the Lord." Jesus has left
[2:22:07] the bride to give Satan the last
[2:22:10] punch. The final glories with the
[2:22:14] bride. What you are doing now, we are
[2:22:17] doing this. We are doing this in the
[2:22:21] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In the
[2:22:23] power of resurrection, in the quicking
[2:22:26] power that open the seventh seal, in the
[2:22:29] power of the third pool, in the power of
[2:22:32] the change of body, we come at the final
[2:22:34] voice to the final age. Satan will
[2:22:40] come. Hallelujah.
[2:22:47] And when we go to the rapture, we're not
[2:22:50] running away. We want to make sure the
[2:22:53] count is
[2:22:55] on. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 out. It's
[2:23:06] finished. Then I can go to the
[2:23:10] rapture. We can cross over, brother.
[2:23:13] When we are finished with the battle
[2:23:14] here, when we are done with the battle,
[2:23:17] that's going to change the body. Before
[2:23:19] that, we got to fight with our souls.
[2:23:23] Somebody say, come
[2:23:25] [Music]
[2:23:33] brother. Rapture is not a place of
[2:23:37] escape because you're running away from
[2:23:39] demons. No, no, no.
[2:23:42] to overcome
[2:23:43] us. Overcome sin, overcome sickness,
[2:23:47] overcome death, overcome the palities,
[2:23:50] force of darkness, overcome false
[2:23:53] doctrines. Overcome false
[2:23:56] doctrines. It's part of the
[2:23:58] victory. Then we go home. God bless you.
[2:24:02] God bless you. God bless you. It's all
[2:24:05] in the knowing. It's all in the knowing.
[2:24:08] It's all in the knowing. Hallelujah. God
[2:24:10] bless your heart.
[2:24:13] Hallelujah.
[2:24:16] Glory to God. God bless you.
[2:24:24] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:24:26] [Music]
[2:24:28] Hallelujah. It's all in knowing.
[2:24:32] Come on. You can rejoice.
[2:24:34] We have a reason to rejoice.
[2:24:38] Let's give the Lord a clap of praise.
[2:24:41] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. My
[2:24:46] Oh, hallelujah.
[2:24:48] I feel so
[2:24:50] happy. I feel so rejuvenated.
[2:24:52] [Music]
[2:24:55] Oh, that's some kind some
[2:25:02] preaching. That's what we believe.
[2:25:06] Amen.
[2:25:08] Hallelujah. Amen. I love a preacher that
[2:25:10] preaches from an open
[2:25:13] book. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:18] Musicians, can we sing the movie on? The
[2:25:20] movie is
[2:25:22] on.
[2:25:24] Hallelujah.
[2:25:26] Amen. How many know the movie is
[2:25:29] on? We are not going to escape in the
[2:25:32] rapture.
[2:25:34] No, we are going because we are
[2:25:37] overcomers. We are overcoming and we are
[2:25:40] overcomers.
[2:25:43] Amen. Hallelujah. God bless you, brother
[2:25:46] Brian.
[2:25:48] Amen. May he anoint you more. Let us
[2:25:51] give him a clap of
[2:25:52] praise as we thank the Lord for what he
[2:25:55] has done.

[2:38:03] God. A loving Jesus,
[2:38:07] we are so grateful tonight.
[2:38:10] God, we are we feel so
[2:38:13] blessed to
[2:38:16] know to know who we are in this
[2:38:20] house. Oh
[2:38:23] Lord, our hearts are
[2:38:26] [Music]
[2:38:27] rejoicing, Lord Jesus, for who we are.
[2:38:33] Lord, as we are waiting, Lord Jesus, for
[2:38:35] that
[2:38:37] moment when we will step on into
[2:38:43] immortality, we don't pray to do
[2:38:47] that. We know we sure
[2:38:51] will because by the revealed word of
[2:38:53] this
[2:38:55] day, we have known who we
[2:38:58] are. You say, Lord, through the lips of
[2:39:01] your prophet,
[2:39:03] that if the true
[2:39:05] church will know who she
[2:39:08] is and what she stands
[2:39:11] for, she will be an invisible
[2:39:15] army. Not even the devil can defeat that
[2:39:18] church. And Lord, when you on earth, you
[2:39:20] said not even hell will prevail against
[2:39:24] you. All hell cannot prevail against us.
[2:39:27] All sin cannot prevail against us. All
[2:39:30] the powers of darkness can prevail
[2:39:31] against us. They will try to fight but
[2:39:34] they will never
[2:39:36] prevail. That's why we are
[2:39:39] overcomers together with the overcomers
[2:39:41] of all the other
[2:39:43] ages. Lord we will meet
[2:39:45] together. Having
[2:39:47] overcome we know who we are.
[2:39:50] Thank you oh
[2:39:52] God for your love upon us and for the
[2:39:58] predestination for this word of the
[2:40:01] hour. We appreciate you for the servant
[2:40:03] you have
[2:40:04] used. Bless him Lord
[2:40:06] Jesus. Oh God he has spent a lot of
[2:40:10] energy. May you Lord sustain him and and
[2:40:14] Lord refill him
[2:40:16] father and grant every desire of his
[2:40:18] heart. Bless him. bless his
[2:40:21] ministry back at home, Lord, and his
[2:40:24] family. I pray that grant every desire
[2:40:26] of his heart. And Lord, whenever he
[2:40:29] comes back again and wherever he goes,
[2:40:32] may he continue to be a blessed bride.
[2:40:35] Bless our pastor
[2:40:36] Charles and his family that are here,
[2:40:38] Lord, with us today. And he has been
[2:40:42] generous enough to share this gift with
[2:40:44] us.
[2:40:46] Lord, bless him and his ministry as
[2:40:48] well.
[2:40:50] Grant your blessings upon the people
[2:40:52] also as we will give Lord of the
[2:40:55] substance you have given to
[2:40:56] us. Lord may you bless every
[2:40:59] giver as we go. Whatever we have heard
[2:41:04] may it stay in our
[2:41:06] hearts. May it continue to
[2:41:09] energize in the precious name of
[2:41:12] Jesus.
