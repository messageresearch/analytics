was going on but she decided not to leave oh my isn't it amazing and God gave her grace to have a good child birth I thought that was something wonderful amen so we are reading second first Peter rather chapter 2 9 to 10 I also want as we are reading I want to appreciate Brother Martin brother and other [Music] brothers that took their service on Sunday God bless you so much uh we are reading uh I read also this portion of scripture part of this I read it inana so it's just like a continuation but here a chosen generation a royal priesthood Unholy Nation A peculiar people that he should show forth the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness into this marvelous Into His Marvelous Light which in time past we are not a people but now but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy amen you may have your seats maybe you can just speak to the Lord a little more father we now give the service to you to your people that are connected on the internet are here physic and whoever that might view this service we ask your blessing upon someone who might be downcast someone who might be discouraged someone who might be sick someone who might be tormented may this service give them hope may they come closer to you may they know that you are real your word is real that you a very a very present help in ter of TR I commit them into your hands take me out of the way and may use me for your in Jesus name amen so I'm speaking to you church tonight on I am who God says I am amen would you like to turn to your neighbor and tell them I God says I am and I'm going to tell you in our generation we have a lot of Christians that are living very defeated [Music] lives now when I said defeated life I mean many things it could be a defeated life because someone is constantly living in sickness it could be a defeated life because someone is repeatedly confessing uh the bad things that they are going through and their failures it could be a defeated life because someone cannot be able to pay bills maybe find food to eat it could also be a defeated life because they are living in sin and having some Spirits upon them that they find uneasy to break out and then they accept the definition of the devil upon their life upon their family upon their community so you often find people saying my sickness that person is already defeated my sickness Myers my pain my heartbreak my HIV my cancer they have accepted that it is theirs they have owned it they have come to terms with what the devil said they are and so they are living a defeated life and also you find others who may not actually be sick in their body but they they learn to say things that they're going through and they own [Music] them and they say my poverty you know my heartbreak my sin and you know you you you you learn somehow the devil tunes and changes your mind to accept a bad situation upon your life and when you accept it in your mind then you you confess it with your mouth and remember there is power in confession the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the high priest of our confession whatever we confess he is there to make it come to pass so the more you confess poverty the more you will leave in poverty the more you confess defeat in an area in your life the more it will actually Prevail in your life and then after confessing it you will go and pray I Reb this situation I B it I break it I conf and then afterwards you come back my PO nothing is going to happen my joblessness everything is going to remain constant my last because you see you have confessed it and God is faithful to fulfill your confession that is why as Believers no matter what the devil claims we are no matter what life tells us that we are no matter what our neighbors tell us that we no matter what our own bodies tell us we if it disagrees with what God says we are we must never agree with it we must never confess it we will we should always disagree with it you understand what I'm saying because if you accept a bad thing about you so shall it be so tonight I want to speak to you about who I am about who you are and and I just phrase it I am who God says I am I am who God says I am and what does God say about you God says this about you you are a chosen generation if you believe it repeat it after me repeat it in the first first person pronoun I am a chosen generation okay now I want you to you've confessed a lot of negative things so we are here in the house of God to undo everything you have confessed about yourself that is negative this is the beginning of becoming what God has purposed for you to be that's why many times I tell you to confess things and say it on your lips because when you prophesy it when you speak it you know it will surely happen because you know you've placed it on your lips and is the high priest of our confession well if you believe what I believe you can say what I'm saying I am a chosen generation I am a royal priesthood I am a holy nation I'm A peculiar person hallelujah amen this is what God says I am God actually does not see us as commoners God sees us as a chosen generation there is always a generation that is chosen maybe you may be five children in your home but you are the chosen one maybe you are 10 in your clan but you are the Chosen and maybe if you're doubting that you are chosen let me bring it this way there are many people who have heard this message but very few have believed it many people have uh you know believed on Jesus Christ and they are members of denominations but when they hear this message they turn it down they are called but they're not chosen the Bible says many are called but few are chosen only the chosen ones going in the Rapture are you hearing me now amen the Rapture is not for all the Christians the Rapture is not for all the so-called Bible Believers I said so called because they claim to believe the Bible but they don't actually fulfill everything that is written in the Bible they don't they don't have the capacity believe the word and because of that they are not chosen and they were not predestinated unto adoption but we I don't know everyone so I would say but but I have been predestinated I was in the mind of God before I was born before I was in my mother's womb before I came into this world God knew me God separated me God God ordained me and God anointed me amen and he made me amen not only a prophet but let me service he made me a part of him the church that goes to the Rapture is a part of Jesus Christ that is the church that is chosen even among the Jews we have the chosen ones not all the Jews are the chosen ones we have 144,000 Jews these are the elect these are the chosen ones from among the Jews and so we find that even in the Gentile church we have many that are called they are called to leave the world and accept Jesus but they are not chosen the chosen ones are few he did not even choose you because of what you did we will get see it as we go down there he chose you because of his grace he chose you because of his predestination according to his knowledge according to his um it is his prerogative who he chooses and and and therefore he comes and says you are a chosen generation you are a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people and I want to show you where the power of the of the Church of the chosen ones of the Bride [Music] is a prophet would say here in the revelation of Jesus Christ now there now remember this Christ in the Church in Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts you know the book of we have four four books Mark Luke Matthew and John these are the Gospels it records the things that Jesus said it records the things as it happened according to what they heard or according to what they witnessed that's why we said The Gospel According to Mark The Gospel according to Matthew the Gospel According to Luke now for example I'll give you one example Mark says in the Book of Mark 16 that going the world preached the gospel he says Jesus said these words this is Mark that Jesus said go in the world preach the gospel to every creature that believes and is baptized shall be saved that's what Mark comments but when it comes to Matthew Matthew says Jesus said uh um um in Matthew 28 now he says going the whole world and okay I forgot the way he renders that let us get it okay it says it says go ye there and teach All Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Spirit teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even until the end of the world so who is correct so people the theologians they debating no Matthew is not correct no Mark is correct but Mark here added this but the word of God is Not subject for debate the word of God is fully correct how many agree with me you say Amen the word of God is yeah and amen to the believer in this church we believe every word we believe every verse we believe every line we believe every word what even even a full stop can I have a big amen to the Believers who believe so whatever they say is correct and the Bible does not contradict but now we find that Matthew said that and and Mark said that but now the holy spirit is the one that maybe this one is saying what they had or the other saying what they had but when the Holy Spirit comes down on the day of Pentecost it begins in the book of Acts chapter 2 from that moment onwards they were not saying what they heard they were not saying what they saw but they were demonstrating what Jesus Christ himself say let me take it a little higher demonstrating who they had become because of what Jesus said they were so now the book of Acts is not a story is not um you know reference they're referring to this referring to that it is now the the place where Acts were done they did not instruct they did not say that Jesus told them to baptize but that's where they baptized and you find that all people were baptized in the book of Acts we are baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and that's why we keep on saying if anyone is not baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they need to go back again to the water because they were never baptized correctly now the book of every other book you go back and read go and check every book ends with the word amen amen is a full St but the book of Acts has no Amen on it because it did not end the book of Acts continues for as many as we receive the Holy Ghost amen will do the things that was done in the book of Acts hallelujah amen God is still here on the SC God is not dead our God is alive everything that was done we still do it today what do you find in the book of Acts you find Believers that cast out Devils we still believe in believe in casting out Devils today we find believers who we baptized we still baptized today by the way can you imagine they are preach who are preaching that baptism is no longer necessary which Bible do they read water baptism is necessary for every believer because we are continuing the book of Acts the Holy Spirit came then and baptized Believers he still comes today amen if if if there were tongues and interpretation of tongues same thing must happen today now in the true church but in the false Church you will find the same things but upside down in the false Church you are going to find women preachers in the book of Acts you don't even find one single woman preacher but in the false churches you will find women preachers you will find women wearing trousers you will find women having the spirit of Jezebel rather than the spirit of Christ that's the false church but in every true church now what is the church we are just a fellowship of the church the Church of Jesus is all over the world it is a mystical body it is all over the world and whenever you find a fellowship a group that is part of that church they will practice exactly what is in the Bible and I believe here we are part of that body and then he says that now Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it you know the desire of the devil is to make it look warm to make it formal to make it powerless may we never become formal a place where you even go to church and you feel so heavy you can't even say Amen the reason why that happens is because the devil is making you for there are many spirits sitting on you which are not the spirits of Christ but if the spirit of Jesus Christ is sitting on you and you hear the word echoing in your ears it will give you the appetite you will automatically begin to love it you will begin to say Amen you will begin to cheer the word you will begin to shout hallelujah why because Christ the spirit of Christ is upon but he says the spirit of the Antichrist wants to make the church look warm foral and Powerless now the Book of Revelation exposes Satan revealing his works now the works of Satan is the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of his word right down to the time he cast he cast into the Lake of Fire that the Book of Revelation Reveals All That Satan FS that he cannot stand it he knows and I wanted to begin with this quote because it brings out my title properly and I wanted to here Satan knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she the church can do the Greater Works she will be an invisible Army the devil knows that if the church finds out who she is and there that's why the devil tries his best to cover her eyes you shouldn't know who you are you shouldn't know who you are and so people are walking blind they blindfolded by demons in they blindfolded to who really they are the devil reduces them to being a denomination the devil reduces them to the to the to their weaknesses and the things happening around them the devil reduces them and you know the things I'm speaking to you here friends I have been in a lot of counseling sessions and I don't know how you are but I'll tell you you know we we are in a very difficult generation we are in a generation that the devil is ready if possible to completely remove and destroy the church and when you talk to young people you realize many of them don't actually understand the authority they have over sat they cannot understand what God has said they are they cannot understand what the word of God says even about them and how is the devil going to hinder them from understanding by making them not read the word by by you know making them so busy by the way social media is our number one Enemy Number One Enemy Number One enemy you know you can spend two hours how many have smartphones here and even to those of you who have not I'm sure you're planning to have one very soon and I'm sure you had one before and you you can spend 2 hours 3 hours scrolling scrolling you don't know what is down but you keep scrolling and and the devil keeps us that way the more we spend time there the less time we spend in the world and why is he doing he doesn't want us to realize who we are and the more things you watch on social media the more you will know your weaknesses you will find what others are doing you will see the Badness in people and you realize that you are almost like them as well and so you you just well it's not after all it's not only me it's everybody else but the word of God reveals what the true church is and what she stands for and what she can do and once the church realizes who she is and what she stands for and what she can do she will be an army that cannot be defeated if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit design and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her if you can be able to understand the two Spirits working in the framework of the Christian church and by God his holy spirit you are able to discern and overcome and withand and overcome and fight over and overcome the Antichrist Spirit now Satan is powerful but before you who has received that Revelation Satan will be powerless meaning he will do everything he has been doing before but before you he cannot move you an inch he cannot overcome you you shall not be moved because you have realized who you are when someone realizes who they are there is nothing can move them praise the name of the Lord when I was in M I gave a story did give a talked about this little slave boy and how when he went to slavery he was very different and you know they would come buy these slaves byy the slaves and so when he wanted this slave master looked at this one and he said let me buy this one he said this one is not for sale he said why is it not for sale one is mine said but I want this one because it's very special he said no I want he not for sale they said why is it different he told him I'll tell you I found out that back at their home the Homeland where he came from he was a son of a king he was a slave among the slaves but he behaved different he talked different he walked different he his mannerism the way about him everything was different he was in pain like the rest he was in suffering like the rest he was in poverty like the rest he he was in trials and Temptation like the rest but he was different his stood with shoulders High he never did confess that he was a slave he could not confess he was a slave why because he knew who he was no amount of slavery no amount of trouble no amount of problems could make him sto so long because he knew who he was he was a son of a king and now the Bible has said we are a royal priesthood we are a chosen generation we are a holy nation we are peculiar people God said all these things about us before we are even born Hallelujah so it's not about us it's about what he has said about us and if we can only know the power The Authority that the word has given to us the devil is going to become powerless before us hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah amen if you can only know amen what the word tells us if we can only have the revelation we know now because I've read it for you but I'm talking about having a revelation if you can have the revelation of who you are of what you stand for amen amen if you can only have that Revelation the devil become powerless and you will become an invisible Army meaning every battle you fight you will win it every battle over sickness every battle over temp every over sin you will def every over poverty you will overcome why because you are become an invisible Army you will not live like the rest of them when everybody accepts you know the spirits come upon them and eventually they they say they accept you find someone actually literally you know having a spirit of last overtaken with this woman that woman that woman that woman and then he realizes I think me I'm born this way I have accepted I cannot have only one wife find them now marrying here marrying there having children he doesn't even know the number of children he has because he has accepted that he is weak that he is adulterous but now let me tell you amen the Bride of Jesus Christ amen for you you will be fought and tempted in your body like them but amen if you have a revelation of who you are of what Christ the word has told you that you are then you are going to realize you are going to be an invisible it will be impossible for the devil to defeat you it will be impossible for the spirit of adultery to overtake you you young people it will be impossible for the spirit of fornication to overtake you amen why because you have realized who you are oh some of us before we got married I tell you when we realize who we are when we realize who we are we began fighting the says as the B says we put on the whole AR what is the armor prayer salvation other things when we put on this armor amen faith we began fighting we began fighting by the spirit of fornication comes and you standing before it and the Bible remember you have been told youis you're going to be F against have you ever seen an army that can never because youy means you going to fight amen but you will say I must fight if I should reain increase my courage Lord amen some of us fought some of us fought and I want I want to speak to the young people just briefly I remember there was a time you know I don't remember how old I was probably probably I was 19 or 18 thereabouts and and there was this beautiful beautiful girl very beautiful brother Divine and and and so say Pastor how do yeah you can be able to know who is beautiful and who is ugly so are you tempted oh yeah of course I was tempted oh come on I thought you were spiritual oh you a hypocrite that's why you're saying that that's why you are saying that because you two are tempted every day and we sing songs tempted and TR we are off why it should be so we tempted every day but here then this girl as she was very busy tempting me in my heart she the devil trapped me very well she WR me a very beautiful letter I was shocked sister do you know why I was shocked because I was also being tempted already and then she wrote me a letter so the job had become easier for me I read as I read that letter she she she said I remember some of the words why are you behaving around me like this I I try to talk to you but you just walk away and and you know I always you know when I sleep you know all the tears feeling my pillow because I think about you every time and and and you are not giving me attention please at least answer this letter at least I said oh God now I began fighting now I did not put those words in my mind I put the word of God in my mind you are a royal priesthood you are a holy nation you are a peculiar people I I began mentioning those words and speaking those words and believing those words and confessing those words you not going to commit fornication you're not going to live immoral you're not going to live this kind of life I started breathing so fast it was a Temptation it was a temptation I took that letter and the devil told me answer that letter answer that letter you already know you have also feeling the same way but I said to myself I am not going to answer this letter and the spirit of God told me take the letter to your pastor and the devil told me you know you can't do that you be a fool to do that I fold the letter like my handkerchief here and I was shaking even and I went to the Pastor said pastor there is something I wanted to talk to you about and it was a big burden for me by the way now when I look back I said really it was it was a devil trying to tempt me to try to kill me but because I realized who I was and he said what is it I told him I have this letter I I I just want to give it to you I walked away I just gave it to him and walked away when I reached back in my room I realized I received Victory I was no longer nervous but I was so happy so full of freedom I began worshiping I began praying that that kind of Prayer of Victory but if you are defeated we shall see you by the way you appear in church especially you younger people who come to church and you appear as if a duck is sitting on [Music] you you can't even say Amen you are all in Chains we know you are in defeat spiritual say this brother they will even begin praying for you this they will even begin praying but if you overcome like that every day in your life when you come to the house of God you are going to be lose you are going to be shouting amen amen why because you have no chains Bing you you know who you are you are not what your body says you are you are What God Says You Are Hallelujah am many demons will try to come and try to imprison you in some kind of uh in some kind of prison and tell you you are this you are that that's why you even found people coming up after many years there's this preacher in America he a shame friends the generation we are living in he came up I think after many years and they they were calling him Bishop Bishop he said brothers and sisters I'm tired of hiding finally I'm coming out to announce to all of you that that I'm [Music] gay and everybody was like what is that someone who who does not know who they are and let me tell you friends these spirits and not only in the world whatever the enemy will try to use about with on anyone in the world he will try on the church all these immoral Spirits you may never be even tested by drinking or smoking or what more but you can be tested in some other area whereby it is even unexpected but now the question is who are you are you what your body says you are are you what the people says you are are you what the devil says you are are you what circumstances around you say you are listen friends this is this is what has given me strength this is what has given me power over sin over the devil for the past 18 19 years of my salvation I have always taken what God says I am and I always confess What God Says I Am and when you confess What God Says You Are can never be defeated by any power by any Force by any Devil by any demon why you will live above it you will be overcoming daily and I want to give you a Biblical example here of a man called Gideon judges 6 verse1 judges chter 6 verse1 and the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Midian of of Midian seven years and the Hand of the Midian and the Hand of Midian prevailed against Israel and and because of the midianites the children of Israel made them dens which are in the mountains and caves and strongholds praise the name of the Lord now friends when you do that which is evil in the sight of the Lord the Lord will deliver you in the hand of your enemy and the Hand of your of your enemy will actually Prevail against you now this is what Satan wants us to think about [Music] ourselves he wants us to live in caves in dens in strongholds he wants us to to live in hiding he wants us to live in fear they had lived untrue to God but regardless they were still his children how many understand what I'm saying Israel had lived un true and because of that God gave them gave them over to the hand of the enemy for seven years whatever they would cultivate at the time of harvest the midianites would come to harvest and whenever the Israelites saw the midianites coming they would quickly run away and hide in dens hide in mountains caves and strongholds and and that's why the devil wants the church how has to be the devil wants it that whenever you see him coming he wants you to take off he wants you to live in fear he wants you to live in hiding whereby he knows you fear that Spirit each of you Church each of you each of us has something whereby you attempted by actually in the in the Bible in the book of James let me just present this onto you church tonight and I hope it will be a blessing to somebody tonight okay now in the Book of James I believe it is um chapter one vers 13 I'll begin from vers 12 blessed is the man that endureth Temptation so now listen please CL which means Temptation you can't pray like this oh God take away Temptation it is not going to go away are you hearing me are you hearing me Church Brother Joseph God is not going to come and catch it and take it away it's going to remain there but it says blessed are you if you endure it now enduring it meaning going through it pressing through overcoming daily blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is tried he shall receive the Crown of Life which the Lord has promised to them that love him let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any man [Music] you understand so God cannot tempt you no and God cannot be tempted with evil so when you are in a Temptation don't say God is tempting God cannot tempt you but I will tell you what tempts you the scripture says every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own last and enticed [Music] so you see the Bible now here says every man is drawn away of his own desires and you know it entices you you find everybody has a different kind of weakness or Temptation and you see he says that when last has conceived when that desire conceived now now okay are you following me now these are a very good scriptural things we can be able to look at to help us overcome now he says when last has con when when last he says okay wait he says when last has conceived so last conceives last is your desire your desires things that entice you things that pull you away from God things that seduce you amen it says that when it comes to you when it is finished with you when you feed it and you give it room it impant you so in your spiritual womb you become pregnant with your L that's why you find you know people who watch certain things you know you find that they keep watching it they keep watch until they they get pregnancy when people talk to bad people people who are already perverted in their minds so over and over and over and over you find that also in in your mind you begin feeding yourself with those things you become pregnant of that Spirit you have not actually done anything bad yet but you are pregnant with that Spirit it may be a spirit of theft and you pregnant with it but you have never stolen anything but you are the one who always goes and watches movies of Thieves you you always want to hear stories of Thieves you meet people who are thieves and you find that someone actually even can know how they break into a house where when what time he knows all the tactics how do they know that they are pregnant with the spirit of Seft and you find another person maybe is pregnant with the spirit of Witchcraft he has never Bewitched but you see he puts you know how does bewitching begin it begins with hatred and then you know you add on rumors and gossip and and then from there and then competition and from there then you feel like it is a process you begin to have a pregnancy everybody is saying God bless you God bless you you brother you a sister but you are pregnant not pregnant of the word but prant of a spirit to that people who go into fornication you don't just fornicate it begins with pregnan spiritual pregnancy whereby you begin watching bad videos reading bad magazines whereby you begin going into wrong things and you talk to about wrong people and and you know all these things begin to come on your mind and you become pregnant you know all the figures you know everything about women how do we know you the moment you bring that subject you become excited you even see them in the church when we whenever we call youth meetings and you want to talk about God boy relationship these who are over excited because they already pregnant with a certain Spirit leading them to Immortal living you know you begin by filling your mind and seeing wrong things and hearing wrong things and you know you know when you open all those Gates of your mind of your spirit of your flesh you become pregnant of that uh of that lust of that desire you know you know you can you know talk about other desires there very many many desires some alcohol other smoking and other things you know you become pregnant and then he says and after you have conceived that conception bringeth forth sin so here is where you find a person when you talk about something or rather you talk against it they don't like you you always want to judge people what is wrong with fornication can't you preach without mentioning fornication because they already Sinners who is a sinner a sinner is a nonbeliever whereby the word of God comes and it judges you but you're not willing to accept it so now that pregnanc bring for sin and remember anything you do it begins with this pregnancy what if committed adultery it began with sin with unbelief by unbelieving what God Said and doing things according to her own L and and now sin is not the end and When sin is finished it bringeth forth death now when you die you can't be born again you're gone the Bible even says it is impossible you are once enlightened you tested of the gift of God and then you go back again and and and you become pregnant and you you sin and you die there's no more that can be done for you so what ought we to do we are supposed to in fear we are supposed to walk in sincerity we are supposed to actually know what the word of God says that we are otherwise I'm not saying church that you should not have um you know the Temptations and desires that are wrong actually anybody who preaches that is preaching a wrong doctr what the gospel does for us is not to take away from our flesh bad desires because our flesh can never be born again our flesh can never receive the Holy Ghost but what the word does is to fill us with the power of the Holy Ghost in our soul that we may be able to put our flesh under subjection the Bible says work in the spirit so that you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh meaning the desires of the flesh will be there even when you receive the Holy Ghost the desires of the flesh will remain there but when you have the Holy Spirit and you working in the spirit you will not fulfill them because you will now only be listening to One Thing the power of the Holy Ghost in you you'll be listen to One Thing who you are who you are there are certain things our president cannot do not because he cannot do but because of who he is and because he knows who he is there are certain things the king of England cannot do because he doesn't have the ability to do them but because of who he is hallelujah you can't find our president going there ordering forx on the street you can't find him doing that eating maze on the road doesn't he have the ability to do that he does but he can't do it because he knows who he is so now when you receive the revelation of who you are you know you have a better life you can live a higher life you will aim and treat yourself with respect With Honor because you have a revelation that there are certain things you cannot do because of who you [Music] are now we see here the Israelites were living in dens in caves and in strongholds in vers three and so it was when Israel had sown that the midianites came up and the amalekites and the children of of the East even they came up against them and and they encamped against them and destroyed the increase of the earth till Thou come unto Gaza and left no sustainance for Israel neither sheep nor Ox nor ass [Music] came up with their cattle and their tents and they came as grasshoppers for multitude for both they and their camels were without number and they entered into the land to destroy it and Israel was greatly impoverished because of the midianites and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord [Music] hallelujah now let me tell you friends if you're a child of God if you do your sins you pay for your sins that's true I will not lie to you about that praise God I know you don't want to hear that that's the truth if you live wrongly and a wrong kind of life you will pay for it in this life knowing if you do things knowingly that they're wrong there's always payback time and Israel was going through payback time [Music] here where the amerit and the midianites came up against them and they were they were destroying all their Harvest they came in as grasshoppers to destroy them and they they made them poor that's what the devil wants to do some of you you may actually be physically poor having having Financial issues simply because you didn't pay your Ty God will allow you the amerit and the medit to come and make it is the consequence to your wrongdoing so you see but if you pay your tiers and offerings God promised to protect your increase to preserve it to bless you do we believe that church but then we see here when Israel moved that way and they displeased God he allowed midianites and the Amit to come up against them and D they destroy their increase they came in as grasshoppers Israelites became poor the med Came Upon them as grasshoppers to destroy them but one part I loved here and the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord that's one thing that we have as an upper hand against our enemy amen that's why I love what Mah said Mah said Rejoice not against me oh my enemy when I sit in darkness the Lord shall be a light unto me when I fall down I shall rise up if you're a child of God no matter what happens it is who God said you are and amen if God was to choose he will always choose you he will always choose you amen when you cry unto him he will always have mercy and our hope is not in any material wealth or in any man our hope is in God when we are in trouble friends if you see things not going well especially most of you young people in your financial life and before you go to people and even you adults please lend me some money me some money please before you do that first go to God In Prayer search your life how is your spiritual life are you standing right with God because it may be God who has allowed that to happen imagine a brother who doesn't pay TI God says he a robber and then he says he puts money in the pocket where there is hes now that kind of brother he will always be in lack and now imagine that kind of brother coming to you who pays your tith as proper saying borrow me and you also my brother are you on the side of God or you are not there are certain people you can even help and you also yourself get in trouble because you you're not on the side of God that's why everything we do we have to seek the mind of God what is God's will about that so you can be able to do what is acceptable and the will of God and so we find that when a child of God is in trouble you should always come to God In Prayer because God has answers to your troubles Psalms 1211 it says I will lift up my my eyes to the heels from when cometh my help my Help Cometh From The Lord which made the Heaven and the Earth amen can you personalize this to yourself he will not suffer my food to be removed REM he that keepeth will not Slumber behold he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper The Lord Is Thy shame upon th right hand the sun shall not smite thee by day know the Moon by Night the Lord shall preserve thee from all evil from all evil he shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall preserve thy going up and they coming in from this time forth and even forever more Hallelujah Isaiah 59 5919 it says so shall they fear the name of the Lord from the West and his glory from the rising of the sun when the enemy shall come in like a FL the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard against by the way usually this is what we should confess as Believers even when you are found in wrong even when you have found amen maybe you have done something wrong and the Hand of the Lord has been lifted up against you don't worry sister don't worry brother come to him amen come with this word on your lips when the enemy comes to me like a flood amen the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a stand against him and he says also he that keepeth Israel shall not sleep shall not Slumber My Help Cometh From The Lord when all the midianites and all the amerit had come to squeeze life out of Israel what happened Israel Run To God In Prayer hallelujah oh my that's why we should be men and women of prayer because when you go to God In Prayer your God does not Slumber your God does not sleep amen hallelujah and he will preserve thee from all evil actually in Psalms 917 he says a thousand shall fall at thy sight and 10,000 at TH right hand but it shall not come near you because thou Hast made the Lord which is my which is my refuge even the most high you've made him thy habitation there shall no evil be thee neither shall any plague come near thy dwelling I want to say to you Church make the Lord your habitation amen do not plant things when you are out of the will of God our hope as Believers is not in the things that man can do our hope as Believers is in God if you're trusting your husband trusting your wife your father your friend more than you trust in God it's not going to be well with you but may God help us that we'll be able to trust in him so let us finish up this story in of Gideon verse S and it came to pass when the children of Israel Cried unto the Lord because of the midianites that the Lord sent a prophet unto the children of Israel which said unto them thus sayith the Lord God of Israel I brought you up from Egypt and brought you forth out of the house of the of bondage and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians and out of the all that oppressed you and drave them out from before you and I gave you their Al and I said unto you I am the Lord your God he are not the god of the Amor in whose land you dwell but ye have not obeyed my voice and there came an angel of the Lord now friends the moment God brings his displeasure to his people something happen one thing led to another the first thing was the Israelites came in prayer that's why when things are happening in your family go in prayer call all your children every go in prayer let us begin to do that sometimes in the church we can do that as well if you realize things are not going well here and there you said let's call up a prayer and a fast it is healthy it is scriptural and when you do that pleases God that now God will begin will send his messenges and they will begin to speak his word and tell you his mind about what is happening so now God told them I'm not pleased with you because you have not obeyed my voice I was with you I took you out of each I brought you out of bondage I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians deled you out of all your oppressors I dve them out from before you I gave you their land I am the Lord your God fear not the god of the Amon in whose land you dwell but you have not obeyed my voice that was the only problem God had with but God did not forsake them that's why by the way you must always be careful very very careful to speak against a brother or a [Music] sister I'm telling you Church do not grieve the holy spirit that Grieves the Holy Spirit if someone is the chosen of the Lord if someone is the anointed of the Lord if someone is a child of God no matter what they have done no matter what kind of Life they may be living if you can't understand what they're going through a prophet said go and encourage them but if you can't pray for them but never be found to talk against them or talk about them have you seen Brothers have you seen brother sister blah blah blah what does does a prophet said is the same as killing them you're murdering them you're not doing anything good for them you're pushing them deeper into the H they are in the reason I say that is because no matter what the elect does God always stands on the side of the Israel had SE God had given them to the hand of the evil the enemies but when they prayed but when they prayed God was moved amen and he sent a prophet whenever God sends a prophet there is something else coming Hallelujah when he sent a prophet brother also the angel of the Lord came hallelujah amen and there came an angel of the Lord and he sat on the ark that's why I say brother Henry in this generation we have received a prophet amen only two people believe it here we have received a prophet in this generation am I right to say we have the unel of the Lord watching over this message that's why I feel so sorry for people who talk against M by the way I will tell you this go back to the 50s the 60s men who walked with William Bram and were not with him but watched him from AF all these men had high regard and respect as a man of God about people like Roberts Rob Billy Graham Graham and and and actually his gift was birthed out of the Min of you find that these men were very respectful they did understood everything brother William Bram taught but they could not open their mouth to say it is of the devil or it is not correct they were quiet about they preached what they they knew I believe that's the attitude of a true child of God when someone is an elect a child of God be careful not to bring the wrath of God upon you that's why gossip gossip can take very many to Hell more than immorality will that's how dangerous it can be when and Miriam began conniving and talking behind Moses they brought a problem in the church and when God came down he wasn't on their side what were their issues is Moses the only one anointed how could he marry a med it's against the the word and they were right on both accounts but when God came down he was on on the side God is a a principle keeping God he has his principles and his principle is if he makes a confidant with anyone he he always takes his s and in this generation God has made a covenant with a prophet of this generation he made a convenant which he himself came and signed on publicly several times you go to FBI or I don't know I think it's in Congress now there's that picture of the Prophet William Bram with a pill of fire on him and the United States government authenticated it as the only document that has ever been taken with a supernatural physically visible of fire which was with Moses which was with the children of Israel in the desert which Paul saw came down in some hon in Texas and was taken when this man took these pictures all of them died on that film only one picture that one the seventh picture the seventh messenger the seventh picture was the only one which was good and when it came out and it was developed they realized the pill of fire was there the same pill of Fire was always saying he is here now the holy spirit is not to fit from where I am standing God himself came and made a covenant openly before all to see before the whole world and he said I am with this man Hallelujah and his the man died long ago but his message was Vindicated by God it has been proven by God Hallelujah and this the angel of the Lord is around this message you've seen these men who have come up recently to talk up against Israel you saw what happened to them one of them was speaking public and he spoke I don't remember the words immediately he fell down and died and recently also this man in Iran he was actually even here in Uganda he also spoke some filth stuff about Israel and both of them would be talking about the end of Israel when they talk against them against Israel being that is going to be ended wiped out God brings down his judgment upon he also died now what was God trying to do God was passing a message saying you can't do that I have a covenant with Israel right now Israel is in blindness right now Israel cannot actually receive the Messiah right now it's not their time yet it's still the gentle dispensation but even in their blindness even in their rejection God is fighting for them how much more the Bride of Jesus Christ a true Born Again child of God God will always fight for them that's why when you know who you are and people are fighting you people are speaking words against you never speak back let God fight for you because God will always fight for youu amen you just have to know who you are and right here the angel of the Lord came even when they had not heard his voice God was not ashamed to say I identify myself with Israel and there came an angel of the Lord and sat under an o which was in Oprah that pertained unto joash and the ab abite and his son Gideon threshed Wheat by the wine press to hide it from the midianites and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him and said unto him the Lord is with thee thou Mighty Man of Val now I wanted to understand Gideon was the son of um joash and this man actually his father even had an alter for B just like the rest of them they had sinned and this man Gideon was also hiding he was fearful he was sinful and that's what he had accepted about his life he was poor he was everything you can say but when God when the angel of the Lord came he told he appeared to him and he said the Lord is with you thou Mighty Man of so what should we believe about G is it the reality we are seeing or what God about hallelujah what should we believe about you is it the things around you that everybody see or what God says about what should we believe God said the Lord is with you you a mighty man of Val I believe the Lord is saying us to us the same thing tonight the Lord is with you that mighty men and women of I believe the Lord is saying the same thing to me the Lord is with me and Gideon said unto him oh my Lord if the Lord be with us have you ever seen when God says something and even you don't believe it about yourself is with you I wish Pastor knew about my life I'm a very fearful Pastor I'm even a very sner good sinner Gideon didn't believe God's testimony about him didn't say Amen my Lord if the Lord be with us why then is all this be falling us where shall be all these Miracles which our fathers told us where are they saying did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt but now the Lord has forsaken us and delivered us into the hands of the midianites and the Lord looked upon him and said go in this thy might and thou shal save Israel from the hand of the midianites have not I sent thee now you are very busy complaining about your weakness God is very busy looking at your possibility your Authority your power your commission this is what God is saying and I'm here to preach to you tonight to say You must also be able to say indeed I am who God says I am because when the man was complaining about all the things around him God didn't talk about it God simply said and he says go in your might in this your might where is your strength brother your strength is in the Lord amen and thou shal save Israel from the hand of the median nightes when you see a spirit attacking the church oh the family of believer or one brother one sister you must be your brother and Sister's Keeper by praying for them by interceding for them why because if you know who you are you will never go out to begin gossip you will never go out to begin slandering but what you going to do you know who you are you are a son of God you a daugh of God with authority against every Power Of Darkness therefore you're going to come in prayer and begin to destroy one by one by one by one and deliver the children of God and he said have not I sent the and he said unto him oh my Lord where shall I save Israel behold my family is poor in man and I'm the least of my father's house and the Lord said unto him surely I'll be with you and thou shalt Smite the midianites as one man hey my when I read these things I'm chared because I feel like God was lifting up Gideon to a place that Gideon never thought he was where are you seeing yourself Gideon was seeing himself as a poor man Gideon was seeing himself as a man from a poor family defeated sinful but when God came he said no let me tell you let me tell you I will be with you and you are going to Smite the medion as one Manu one man in the hands of God can bring down the words of J one man one woman in the hands of God can shake all all hell brother you are bigger than you know s there is greatness in you actually in each of us but we can't see it unless we read God's word everything is in here if you can be able to get into God's word then we are going to see the testimony of God about us and I ask you not to listen to the testimony of of you about you from some some other source because that will mislead you but if you listen to the testimony of God about you you are going to live a triumphant life let us stand up on our feet I was still going but uh time is fast spent let us pray precious father there many people Lord that have many bad testimonies about themselves they don't don't even know whether they can be able to do or accomplish anything for you but it's not about what we think about ourselves it's about what you have said about it and you said that there will be a bride a bride without spot without drink washed in the blood of our L and Revelation 197 you also say the bride has made our fre the marriage of the Lamb is come Lord we know that we are going to be on that marriage of the L May you help us that we will not rely on our testimonies about ourself but we will rely on yours about us change us Lord mold us into the character of Jesus Christ a place where we can be able to believe your testimony about us a place where we can overcome a place where we can surrender our lives and know that you Faithful I know you cannot forsake us and that you are going to keep your word because you a covenant keeping Lord we give you praise and we ask that you will make this a reality to every brother and every be with them tonight even as they go back home Lord may your Holy Spirit continue to protect guide provide watch over each one and even now as we shall give our offerings and our ties before we leave this place we ask that you bless every gift and that you will continue to father Lord may you help us that we shall leave as Mighty Warriors for our enemies that we will know you are surely on our side and if you be on our side who shall be against us thank you Lord for this Revelation
