of you who are online God is going to Grant it so you better be expecting something good is going to happen something good is in stores together again to do what to receive your expectations I'm happy because God has given me a little inspiration tonight that I have no doubt that will be a blessing to us 18 to our telecoms so while we stand we read out of Genesis chapter 3 verse 1. now the Beast now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yeah has God said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden so shall we pray precious Lord Jesus we do not take this service for granted yes you are foreign knew each and everything yeah I realize I don't even know what I'm going to speak before the foundation of the world and how it would impact your children Lord may you help me that I will stay in my place and I'll let you speak through my through my my lips that something will be said tonight that your children will be blessed granted in Jesus name amen please be seated I'm speaking today um on this thought and I realize I have many thoughts that I have not concluded on uh and maybe like three or four of them so I have to keep going back as the Holy Spirit Will Lead me I mean but today yeah um during the beginning of the week I I this week have been you know meeting quite a few people weekend of changes just doing some counseling with them and um I um this thought just came up in one of those meetings it will be a blessing to us tonight I just want to speak on submitting your abilities to Christ do you realize that each of us is born with abilities born with things that we can do that others cannot do like you know you are born and you are born alone in the world you are the only you in the world there was no one else like you are the only you yeah there you die or the moment that you die that moment we have lost something to feed it can never be replaced again now I know that there are people who are born and they um you know see others and take them as role models and they can sometimes tend to be like them in Chinese [Music] we have also different god-given abilities so much more that the Bible says that gifts and calling uh gifts the gifts and the calling of God are without repentance so many things we can be able to do them at Birth when we've been to be engine you're born with those abilities they don't manifest immediately because you have to grow into them sometimes then you are able to realize that you have certain abilities or certain skills so you don't receive this because you you've been taught being a Toby funeral because you're born again because you're a Christian or because you are good or bad you have them simply because you're a human being this is what makes you different from the others we know one of you [Music] and I can give you quite a few here I know you already know yours things that you are good at it or things that you you are differentiates you from the others you know some have um a convincing tongue tongue [Music] you know even watching little children you can be able to refresh and say ah this one will be this so that one will be this and others you know can can there are very very instrumental in making things like they cannot make money you can build things maybe others are good givers they did not need to learn it from somebody to be a good Giver later others talk too much and you know it's a natural ability they just can't talk too much and you know I was speaking with the other brother the other day and he told me I'm like that Pastor rather smile a lot these are natural abilities but it is difficult to attain them even when you did you cannot be like the person or the human being that had it at Birth different people diversities of abilities but now many times and many times this is the problem but we do not yield our abilities to Christ your services we have our abilities and we don't actually use them for the glory of God and I wanted to give you quite a very weird example to begin with this is what has happened the Bible says the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field the Lord God had made and so he came to the woman and actually beguiled the woman now the word subtle means making use of clever and indirect methods of to achieve something foreign [Music] and the Bible says it had all these abilities and I'm going to quite a few things for you here and I wanted to listen to me carefully the power of transformation he says so Saturn that morning perhaps met this evil one which was the serpenter not in a reptiles [Music] smart of all of the beasts and man is Beast himself we are Mama we are warm blooded animal foreign [Music] [Music] can I have three people come up here as I read this Three Brothers I want to demonstrate something for the people he says now science is looking for that Missing Link yeah come on come on three people please and even well it says science is looking for that Missing Link it is now here come right over this side here was the man human beings that God created in His image and here were the other beasts you know the brother says that the other that was a chimp right over the other side and and here between the shrimp katiwakatua and the man no moon was another Beast while which is now these things that I'm preaching to you this evening you cannot hear it anywhere you can't hear it in science because it's not spoken by a prophet of the end foreign hmm he was smart Charlie she gets he was subtle it was wise you see the fruit was pleased and it was desirable and when he lived with her that morning well of course now friends because let's take it a little bit slow here tonight I want you to know that Saturn does not fight useless people who suddenly can never fight anybody that is not useful no he cannot Saturn has an agenda and the only Gods he has a benefit again when you see someone being fought foreign people in the Bible here we can read about them that have been followed from the time they were born talk about people like Moses from the day he was born they never wanted to kill him even you know He Came Upon pharaoh and Pharaoh said go and kill all the young boys because the devil knew question him that someone was born just in that time that someone was going to be born and because of that they don't Rachel the devil told all the women The Midwives to kill the boys are you hearing me this evening kill all of them but do you know the devil was hunting one and that was Moses and mothers was taken in a in a basket was it a basket on on in Egypt the devil wanted to kill him but why did the devil want to kill Moses because sons has had a great purpose one was one of those that were born to destroy the intents and the works of the Devils so he wanted to finish him from the time he was born all three the devil was hunting foreign if you are here in this world those that are a danger to his kingdom how many here you don't need to lift your hand how many years I can tell you you're born foreign you're born for that purpose why do you wear chicken praise the name of the Lord if you have certain abilities [Music] listen please so we're talking about the abilities of the serpenters and when this happened um when the devil came down Lucifer okay let us read on here and then we will come back to that the Beast this is from the Ephesian Church age was so close to a human being and yet was pure animals she was an appraised creature and was somewhat in between a chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man he was closer to a man he was so close to being human that that his seed could and did mingle with that of the woman and cause her to conceive Charlie is if you have Revelation for this say Amen when this happened he changed every born in that serpent yes science can try all it wants to science and you won't find them missingly God and he can see an association of man with animals foreign God so let me read this again you missed it man is smart and he can see an association of man with animals and he tries to prove it out of evolution this little teaching here will help you how many have heard of evolution Evolution how many have never heard of it a was like a chimpanzee but he went becoming us and what happened if you were like this foreign foreign if you are not excited about that I don't know actually I'm excited about it praise the name of the Lord there isn't any Evolution together listen to what the prophet says one who went up to seventh grade seventh class praise the name of the Lord you you are in which class you were more educated than brother but hear what he's saying there isn't any Evolution but man and animals [Music] that is one of the mysteries of God that has remained hidden it is serpent here had abilities could even reason like a human being and foreign hmm those were the abilities number one the choker was very wise number three jokes are two good reason number four which could mean to conceived now Saturn in heaven when he stages his Rebellion he desire to come down to the Earth so you can calm down because he failed to take over in heaven so he wanted to come and take over your Saturn does not have a body sitan Italian Saturn only has is a spirit because the spirit suddenly cannot in any way have any connection with the human race without a link so you have to have a link in all that to take over the kingdom of God of Adam on our eyes he says thou has been in the garden of God the devil when he was thrown down from heaven he came down here in the Garden of Eden and when he came down the creature number one he wanted to go to church was one that could help him accomplish his purpose and Saturn could not find any better Christianity you couldn't find we looked at all the chimpanzees had the ability that can be able to connect with the human race but as the devil looked closer remember the devil was a spiritual being joking he was created by God having supernatural abilities witchcraft exists Darkness exists that therefore has power but all the power that he has what God gave him it are you hearing me this evening so I'm checking up with this teaching today cannot do anything with his power that was not given to him by God so whatever power he has lesser than what God has God is the Fountain of all problems I have one of my uncles one of the great witch doctors in our country I've met him once in my life you know he told me about the things they can do yeah and many many quite many things it is so scary when you hear this tells you that they can take a person eat their bed at night and make them dig the whole night and replace them he will tell you they cut that power to be wished using demonic power and influence we control your spirit they are this power because they get it from the devil but as I was trying to speak with him I wanted to understand but do you believe in God he told me anybody that doesn't believe in God is stupid so you believe in God we believe in God and I will tell you one thing the church needs to understand no one can stand before him Hallelujah man I always despise the new man people who go to Witchcraft who fear witchcraft I despise that the Bible says praise the name of the Lord no witchcraft in Israel no enchantment let me tell you God has exposed the many foreign if your sister go and ask my wife she will tell you the stories ever since we got married the witches we could see them in the vision wake up and deal with them in prayer and these are people that we know sometimes sometimes they hide themselves but sometimes God exposes them what is that the Bible says the battle we are fighting flesh we are fighting against principalities you need to know that God will stop when you know the story you cannot fear witchcraft because you will know among witchcraft exists Saturn exists eternally but God is greater than Satan and what Saturn has is called darkness and what we have is called light Isaiah it would be foolish for you to say a Darkness doesn't exists but because you know Darkness exists Oh Glory to God you will turn on the lights Darkness Darkness cannot stand before because foreign and he knew the woman yeah our user but now I want to go to the woman I need something I can use I looked around the garden so with his power foreign [Music] [Music] with all that were naturally given foreign Gatherings and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean Spirit who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains you will follow me in English and then you can read in your Uganda Bible and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the Fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones but when he saw Jesus afarof he ran and worshiped him and he cried with a loud voice and said what have I to do with thee Jesus the son of the most high God I adjour Thee by God that thou torment me not for he is said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit and he asked him what is thy name and he said saying my name is Legion for we are many now I want you to see something here very very well here is Jesus yes coming on on to the other the side of gadara yes there is a reason why he came he will see it shortly he was approaching gadara there was this man Matthew says men to men but here Mark says there was a man and this man had a spirit in him are you following me if you're following me say Amen and so notice this man he was always Bound in Chains No amount of chains could bind him no amount of uh you know thing no man could tell him because he had too much power because let me say it this way and he was controlling him and giving him supernatural abilities when the Devil comes in a man he gives him supernatural abilities to become unnatural [Music] these words are very powerful but I hope and trust that you get a reference I'll give you an example human being has a natural ability to have affections we call it love touched by affection for somebody else and you know Naturally Speaking I I love you my sister because I love you I will give you something I will make sure you're fine but when the Devil comes in a man he will deal with him his abilities and he will Empower Manny's abilities [Music] to the point that those abilities will become unnatural you find a man it's like a money [Music] foreign how much I was changing nine percent but but by the time when we were long gone in the past I noticed he only gave me a quarter of the money oh God I assume so but that day myself as the best what happened one time somewhere I was buying some clothes on the street and when I reached home I saw this good trousers but by the time I arrived at home neither two killed was only a piece so because you know you will buy a trouser and then divide it into two and sell it to two different people the same amount of money [Music] I said really if it is a blessing I would say God has blessed you with wisdom so what is that it is not an ending but when it is natural and normal did you bless others as a way of spiking it up it's just like last but when God when the devil is enters a man you have a very huge sex drive you feel like you can't rest and you feel you have too much passion what is that change it is unnatural ability is controlling your body it is so right now I'm Discerning the devil praise the name of the Lord I'm not it's here and we know about many times because we have seen many people being delivered and this man was in Chains but because the devil was in him he was so powerful in just a moment he had Supernatural yeah but when he saw Jesus coming but also the devil Jesus now I want to show you here which one is the greater power as Jesus was coming yesterday [Music] he worshiped him the Bible says that the devil knows there is one God foreign and at that moment Jesus said what is Thy Name saying my name is yeah every initials today that Jesus Christ is Lord yes [Music] that don't send us very far there is some sweetness this is the business of Saturn for him to operate he needs a vessel your brother sister don't be a vessel of the devil here the devil begs Jesus send us into the swine the way we have entered into this they were crying and Jesus yes give them leaves any green space went down and they entered into the swine and the Heart of the swine ran and businesses [Music] into foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] some people even come to House of Prayer when they have not even cleaned and someone walks through the church who is that if someone let me let me leave what I was going to say but I'm telling you our Deacons [Music] use things you need to use that smell nice [Music] foreign praise God and this man was in terms and a clean Spirits were in here thinking with Dr clothes but when Jesus came all Harley Quinn Spirits your name is Jesus Christ amen I've been in countries which don't believe in Jesus but when you go in a community that believes in Jesus Christ this is the reason why Jesus came amen when he came he didn't come to rescue pigs he came to rescue the man who said that he was possessed by religion let me explain continue this speaks and big seasonal when the devil entered the city they had no choice the beast in the garden did not have any children do what you want religion Legion desired them you desired the pit yes religion desired Legion busy could do nothing about it some people said because of that we don't eat pigs no more Rachel today I'm busy we eat things because those ones died the ones we eat is because they are Sanctified my prayer and the blood of Jesus praise God those pigs not have a choice Legion desired them and they had them [Music] but this man he had a choice the devil desired him it doesn't matter how long since it doesn't matter how long was in the church because he was a seed of God Jesus Hallelujah foreign foreign this man was one of them had no choice to refuse this Deliverance amen if you're a seed of God only hear the word of God no choice but for his word to work foreign to be careful those are all in here but when Jesus came yes we knew one thing yeah Hallelujah so now this man had no choice and you come to the house let me tell you those demons have no choice foreign foreign he doesn't preach because people are very excited speech because people are very hot I don't care you might be cold as they assigned eyes [Music] [Applause] we don't have time foreign [Music] and then before it knew it he was going to the woman not by its power but by the powers and that's how the devil wants to attack and begin flirting with women you can go and begin to steal you can go and begin to tell lies you can go what is that change the slithering tongue possessing so the devil can possession but the difference between US Navy soul is that they have no choice but we have a choice Peter was the son of God Jesus was he talking to Peter yes Peter he was speaking to the devil and what he was speaking was the Gospel so the gospel speaks is really addressed to the devil and the demon no muslim wait behind him Peter did not physically go behind Jesus those demons and here the woman the woman she had a choice of Deliverance let me read this for you quickly because my time is almost time questions and answers 1964. suddenly serpent almost himself the spirit he knew that that was the only sea that would pregnant the woman because the chimpanzee won't do it they've mixed it and everything else it won't do it amen but he knowed that the jam of life that was in the chimpanzee would not come to the field of the woman [Music] but you see the sovereignty of God to display himself as a savior as I've explained many times before he come to her in the form of This Server which was the best and came to her and she Eve was pregnant by how much um [Music] in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ is given to her as a sacred Trust From God no female dog very much no she is the only one by it she the reason is so sacred she is to bring forth life into the eyes her body is the bedding grounds of life that's the reason she is given this sacred aliens now here is where you may disagree many of you theologians that is the whole human race [Music] foreign and why Christians Believers are not encouraged actually they are discouraged to go through applications because the woman's body is the bedding grounds of life he knew that the devil knew that it was only the woman that can bring forth life she was the bedding grounds of life the devil can come to you simply because he knows you are handsome oh you're beautiful and he will use that ability because he knows you have a good voice [Music] so he will come again to become a singer in the Bible because he knows when you speak is brought about the fall of the entire human rights says if if God if God knew that I would I should not do this why did he give me this ability [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen some of you women who know how to talk very well the devil can use the Ability some men these days why what you have the ability you can't be gospel unless you have the ability think about two gospels you know we're the ones look at their ability now [Music] what happened but for you who is not a gospel when you come among people you just sit on us everybody [Laughter] oh come at you if you begin to talk about the Lord Jesus and you'll be like hey my friends do you know what I have the scripture listen to this one motivational and
