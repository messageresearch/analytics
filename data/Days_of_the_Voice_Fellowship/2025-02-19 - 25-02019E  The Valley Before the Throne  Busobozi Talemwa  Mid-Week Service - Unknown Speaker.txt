come on Wednesday we usually have uh seats which you can come and occupy uh we have brother Frederick from restored Faith coming to visit us today nice to see you amen uh we we are going to go in the word if you have your Bible if we could turn to the Book of [Music] Psalms Psalms 23: 1 to 4 this is a very familiar verse um scripture rather many of you can recite it says the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want I think it's it would be beautiful if we all read it together just going to read uh uh verse verses 1 to 4 shall we read it together now the Lord is my shepher I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures he leadth me beside the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteous nness for his name's sake yeah though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy Road and thy staff they comfort me amen amen may the Lord bless you may be seated so this evening I'm uh before we go to the word I just wanted to remind you the wedding of uh sister mlin brother uh is this Saturday so I'm I'm encouraging especially you church members come early I usually see that day or wedding day days especially here at church to be very important because we usually have an opportunity to have new people people who are not yet in the message who even don't even know what the message is all about so it's a a wonderful opportunity for them to know what we believe so if if not for anything come just to be uh a witness to someone new such a day I really would uh believe that it's not only about supporting the two young people it's also about um Outreach in Ethiopia I remember our first wedding brought in very many people you know they are there for the wedding of their family members so whether they want it or not you're going to preach the word and they will hear everything so it's usually a good time amen let us try to come and also come early you you members come early so you can welcome the The Strangers Among Us what what I don't remember the time what time is the is the wedding what time did you invite the people is it 10 as usual I think you on the committee sorry um so it's Saturday in 9:30 9:30 yes in the morning in the morning okay so you've had the time come here by 9 is that amen amen so um I'm speaking on the valley Before the Throne many times and I'm not going to be long as usual on [Music] Wednesday so when we speak about the uh the throne many people want the throne if you look at it politically you've seen that people have shed blood over the years simply because of the thr you look for example in our country the history of our country I remember when President M the current president wanted to be the president uh he was not accepted and even the current the the then president Milton obot spoke very big negative things about him and he even prophesied and he said that talking of says he will never test the throne and he was looking at him as some you know Village People whatever some nothing but now for the P more than 30 years that is the same man who has been on the throne he was not without Bloodshed the man went to the bush um and fought war and you know many people were were dead as a result very very many actually we don't even know the numbers the numbers many paid the price both those who were fighting and the ones who were in the government and the local normal people they fought and others died but those who survived they eventually took the throne and we have been having the nrm government for the past so many years and we might continue having it for I don't know how many more years some of us we were born under the same government but those people paid the price they went through they had their own Valley you know before they got the throne if you talk about other people like Alexander the Great for instance was a great man he almost ruled over the whole world but you see this man fought he shed a lot of blood and then he became uh you know almost a leader of the whole world you talk about um you know these Roman emperors there was an emperor called Emperor Nero there are many many many world leaders there are many talk about also the Babylonian Empire there are many kings leaders that have at one point taken over the throne even you can talk you can turn and talk about the the west and and see the many kings that took over the throne in in Great Britain there was a lot of shedding of blood over the years then one would take the throne but you see when the King of Kings also wanted to take the throne he could not take the throne without the V he had to come down from glory and he came down in the valley of this Earth and he suffered and he was beaten he shed his own blood imagine the Bible calls it in the book of Acts the blood of God he shed his own blood and he tells us ministers to take heed feed the the flock of [Applause] God which he said which he purchased he saved and purchased with his own blood so the king of glory the lord of Lords the King of Kings the greatest emperor that has ever been the creator of Heaven and Earth he came he left the glory left the mountain he left the throne took the valley in order to now take the throne in the right way how much more us who are followers of him you know when you talk about life many people don't want to see life with valleys many people want to talk about life with only good good good times you know when if I if I begin to prophesy now and I prophesy only good things many of you will be very happy but if I can begin to prophesy and I tell you somebody things that might happen which will actually not might which will happen because some of you are 2019 15 things about to happen in your life some good some bad but you see many times we want to see the future our future as if it will only be good but there is always a valley Before the Throne before you attain anything good in this life there is always a value before you attain it there is always challenges sometimes there are times that seem as if you will never attain your goal you see a Believer has something that the world does not have a Believer has Assurance a Believer has Assurance which comes from faith believing that God is able to take and sail them through that's why no matter the valleys or the mountains or the ups and downs of Life are believer must always be joyful we must never allow the the devil to bring us sadness a Believer a True Believer is not is not a sad person yes you may go through tough times but remain joyful you might you might go through difficult time but always have hope because you hope is not in yourself your hope is in the Lord amen the Lord who made heavens and earth the Lord who does not fail so you see a Believer is solid a Believer is grounded a Believer is established a Believer is a believer of the word a Believer does not take the testimony of the situations a Believer takes the testimony of the word and so today I I want us to look at the valley Before the Throne that's why David said though I walk through the valley of the amen how many can speak like David tonight say I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil okay I would like you to speak those words though I walk through the valley of the Shadow death I will fear no evil did you hear that I will fear no evil I will fear no evil meaning evil may come evil not made evil will come I will fear no evil why do we not fear evil because the Lord Is With Us amen and I'd like I'd like you uh to take you through the life of a man who wrote these words who said these words and I would like us to turn to the book of 1 Samuel chapter 24 vers 1 we can read from 1 to 7 and it came to pass when Saul was returned from following the Philistines that it was told him saying behold David is in the wilderness of Ang then took 3,000 chosen men out of all Israel and went to seek David and his men upon the rocks of the wild gods [Music] so sa was an enemy of David because Saul knew that he was losing the throne to David David only one man but you see here is a king who took 3,000 chosen men out of all of [Applause] Israel to seek David though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thou with me and here is a man who said those words he's in a cave he's in a he's in a cave somewhere he he's in a you know a valley somewhere and here is a man who is coming to seek after his he's coming with 3,000 men strong man powerful men thirsting for blood I don't care how many men the devil has dispatched to come and seek after my life listen I don't care how many demons the devil has dispatched to come and seek after my soul I can stand here today and say it Is Well with My Soul amen if walk through the valley by the way let me tell you praise is wonderful when you're in a valley worship is wonderful when you in a valley don't wait for the throne begin to praise when you in your Valley don't wait for the throne begin to worship when you are still in your Valley because that is what confuses Satan canot understand a Believer who worships when they in a trial a Believer who worships when they in the valley don't fear those that the enemy has sent your away don't fear tell your neighbor don't fear and he came to the Sheep's Court by the way where was a cave and Saul went into cover his his feet and David and his men remained in the sides of the Cave the man of David can I have more sound in the in the monor please and the man of David said unto him behold the day of which the Lord said unto thee behold I will deliver thine enemy into thine hand that thou mayest do to him as it shall seem good unto thee then David arose and cut off the Scout of sw's Rob privy and it came to pass after word that David's heart SM him because he had cut of Soul cut and he said unto his men the Lord forbid that I should do this thing unto my master the Lord is Anointed to stretch forth my hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the [Music] Lord so David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them not to Rise Against soul but rose up out of the cave and went on his way now I want you to see many times we think that our enemy is the unbeliever the [Applause] devil sometimes your enemy can actually be your brother the devil sometimes can get these people riled up and anointed fight you but what what we are going to gaug you your spiritual growth by is the way you respond it shows your character it shows your spiritual growth it shows where you stand spiritually when your enemy when when someone a brother comes and speaks things that are not good about how are you going to respond maybe that's your Valley someone just comes and speaks ill against you sometimes even lies some people you know when they lie against them they feel so painful and they feel a lot of anger and they never forgive that person it shows you don't have character yet believer who has gone through things and God has given him character in his heart he will always forgive you will never have bitterness in their heart let me tell you a Believer is always free in their [Applause] heart never a spot of bitterness you should never keep bitterness in your heart you should always be forgiving in your heart you should always have the joy of God in your heart joy and bitterness cannot be together let go and let God rule in your heart and here is David and he found his enemy in the same Valley where he was but he did not kick him he did not you know kill him even when God had given him in his hand you know let me tell you one time I preached here a someon and I spoke about the importance of enemies do you know for you to prosper to go to the next level you need enemies you need enemies you need enemies not you want them you need them you need them even when God is preparing a table for you to enjoy all the goodies to enjoy all the blessings the enemies have to be there so if you say oh God kill all my enemies what about how will God receive Glory your enemies must be there to see you prosper the on who said you will never be married must there to see you getting married the on who said you never drive a car they must be there to see you driving the ones who said you will never overcome sin they must be there to see you change ghost the on who said you never make it they must be there give long life to my hallelujah amen let them live they will see the good in my life amen that must be that should be he prepared the table for us in the presence David never killed his enemy he said God is Anointed I cannot stretch my hand against don't be quick to judge and to curse and to do those things but David at this time had run for refuge in the valley he was at the lowest in his life felt hunted like a dog but he was to be a king doesn't matter his current state he was running he looked like a fugitive but this man was to be a king he was actually already a king even though he had no Throne right now I am looking at some Kings even though we don't see the throne that's why brethren we must walk by faith not by side we are already Kings this man was already a king why because God had already done choose him praise the Lord amen let's go to First Samuel and look at it vers 6 chapter 16 and it came to pass when they were Cal that he looked on Arab and said surely the Lord is God the Lord is Anointed is before him you can read verse by [Music] verse 166 166 sorry 166 now this is Samuel uh after going to the to the house of the of of U of um uh David's father and it says it came to pass when they were come that he looked onab and said surely the Lord is Anointed is before him but the Lord said unto Samuel look not on his countenance or on his height of his sture because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart you see when he was instructed now listen I want this is very amazing when Jess was instructed to call his children he called all his children but he left David out so even Jesse did not choose any of did not choose David as one of his sons because he did not find him worthy to be a king when the the prophet came the moment he saw he was satisfied and he said behold the Lord is Anointed even the prophet of God did not find David worthy that's why the Lord came down and told Samuel let not look at the continence don't look at the height and the stru because I have refused for the Lord does not see as man see it man may see you the way you are now but God does not see you the way you are God sees you the way he chose you am hallelujah amen and how did God choose you amen like you know God not have before he chose there were no many [Music] options no there was only him there were not many for him to choose from you get a point there was only God so if he chose you he must have chose chosen you in him which means he CH himself which means you were already perfect so when he sees you he sees himself when he sees you he sees his glory when he sees you he sees Perfection when he sees he doesn't see poverty when he sees he doesn't see lack when he sees he doesn't see tears when he sees he doesn't see suffering when he sees you he sees him because he says is all in all all sufficient he's the Alpha and Omega so when he sees you when he sees me he sees exactly what he is can God fail God cannot fail so when he sees me he sees possibilities only he does not see imposs when he sees you impurities he sees Pur he sees Perfection stop looking at yourself that's why many of you can't even worship God and serve him the the way you ow because you have never settled the sin question you've always looked at yourself as a little sinner as someone who is insufficient as someone who is really needing a lot of you know to be forgiven but when God sees you he doesn't see any of that by the way that empowers you when you get to understand that then it empowers you so you begin to ignore all the Imp you begin to ignore all your condition you think you are in when God saw David from the very beginning God saw himself God saw Perfection God saw a keing because God himself is a king of kings so that's why when he he talk to David David I give you a kingdom Without End why because God saw himself in David but David himself saw a little Rudy boy his father saw a little poor boy his brothers as we shall see as we continue they despised him the prophet he didn't even think about him when he saw if we live here we can't go nowhere this is the one because when you look at the way is wide large big the height Aman height American height when I see the eyes I see they are the real eyes they are the eyes of the king of Israel when I see the the cheeks they are really the ones the mouth the lips the teeth all the te are there the hair it is all good that one is the king he opened his mouth and said surely Prophet prophet samel he failed to see what God even your preacher your pastor can fail to see what that is shocking you can fail to see what God is [Applause] saying your friends can fail to see what God is saying there is more in you and what we see I fail to see I fail to see what God is seeing but nothing of my failure can hinder what I'm supposed to be and if others are not seeing what God said about me I defy that I am not I am not you know known by my failures some of you know about my fail I am not known by that I am not identified by that isied by hisil are you getting it is not known by our failur every one of us has failures every one of us has weaknesses every one of us has flows inabilities but I want to tell you we are not defined by those things the valy we are in not def our final destination it is just a valley but we are destined for the throne hallelujah amen I'm a throne thing I am not a valy thing a valy but I'm a thing that is where I am hated amen don't wor if you're not yet convinced by the time we done you be just keep saying amen then just called abinadab and made him pass before Samuel and neither has the Lord chosen this then sh to pass by and he say neither has the Lord chosen this again just say made Seven of his sons to pass before Sam Sam said unto Jesse the Lord has not chosen this and Samuel said unto Jesse here all the children and he said the there remain yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and samel said unto Jess send and fetch him you know keeping ship was almost the lowest job you could do for the weak for the lazy young but the strong and the mighty were always in the Army but you see David was a little boy and and he was keep the keeper of and Sam said unto Jesse send and fetch him for we will not sit down till he come here let me tell you child of God there are certain things in the spiritual real God will not allow to happen until you are feted there are certain things that will keep Angels standing there are certain things that God will keep the whole church waiting until you show up and he said wait sech him we will not even sit down until he has come amen I believe I am in the Kingdom such a time as this because God was waiting for me to show up so that something can begin to happen the throne has been prepared the throne has been prepared I am now here I am now here some things are going to begin happening because I am here the world has been waiting until you show up now that you are here now that you are born amen some things are going to begin happen amen amen amen the Lord is chosen is always being waited for I believe we are the chosen of the denominations have been you know there ping up ping up up but God was waiting for the bride to show up and then he says in the Book of Malachi behold I El prop someone didn't get it I send you I said it's not about Elijah about you before I show up before I show up El can show up amen and that's why the Bride of the last days had to be here to show up and this Mali message is all about me everything has been waiting until you show up now I want you to believe that you are here for our purpose this has always kept me going when I find myself in a place maybe here maybe some other country May anywhere else I have this knowledge that I am there for a purpose there is something that is going to appear Complete because I am there it doesn't make me anything it only humbles me and shows me the election of God you always believe you are supposed to bring a difference people talk about somebody and nobody we are some we are not nobody you are not a nobody somebody it doesn't matter how little you are how small you are how big you are if you have been chosen by God you are a somebody amen can you say it I am a [Applause] somebody and he he sent and brought him in now he was Rudy read verse 12 and he was Rudy and with of a beautiful countenance and good good to look on and the Lord said arise arise God is speaking to the prophet arise anoint him for this is he hallelujah amen hallelujah amen because this message is here it means I am here amen amen God has not Anointed The denominations for the We Are The Rapture material we are the one supposed to be anointed for the Rapture and God has spoken to the prophet of Malachi arise anoint him for this is we are anointed for the Rapture amen we to shout Amen to that we are anointed for the coming of the lord we are the people of the open book amen then someone took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of his Breen and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so some rose up and went to R in the message questions and answers says before there was a wild before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was life there was anything when it was still God and His thought the Eternal thoughts of God CHS you by predestination I don't know whether you before there was anything before there was before there was Moon before there was life there was any any person any Angel anything you are in incomparable I am incomparable I'm the best why because I am a part of the Creator before there was anything only and His Thoughts The Eternal thoughts of God chose you CH Me by predestination by for knowledge to know that you would be on earth amen amen to know that you this is not about somebody else it's about me do you get a church you you no you you you Joseph with all your faults with all your problems God CH you in and in knew you you you would be on earth amen amen he chose me in him that means I cannot fail that means I will be and I am an overcomer that means I must overcome the world that means I must overcome sin because he overcame all that the did not Define him he's on the throne today you are thr material Ephesians 1 vers four according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world and we should be we should be holy Without Blame before him in having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according listen to the good pleasure of his own will to the praise of the glory of his [Music] grace amen wherein he has made us tell your neighbor he has made us he has made us accepted in the Beloved I don't care about my failures he has made me [Music] accepted God chose us let this enter you listen brother God chose you [Music] in that you that you that I should be holy and Without Blame before him in this kind of Holiness and this kind of blamelessness is not going to be your eort when he chose you in him he chose you to be holy and bl because God is Holy and God is blameless he CH you to be holy to be blameless before him in love what I'm saying love covers a multitud of all those impurities that you now see God doesn't see because there is coming a day when you are going to completely overcome and live above those impurities some of you are living above them there are things you can clearly say I need to do this and this and this but now I lost the appetite do I have some people like that Happ is the elements of your being [Music] aligning the choice of God and I'm telling you Church all the other impurities must align with that say the word it is not about you struggling it's about you bowing to the water he will make it come to pass stop quitting about what you can't do stop woring about what you can do and what quit worrying about that put all your mind all your thoughts on what he said feed on the word read the Bible read the message more you read it the more you realize you are knowing who you are if you are poor and then you you don't know you a son of a king and the hair of his kingdom and there is a book that has all the proof of who you are you can struggle with that poverty for years and years you will never overcome but get into that book once you read the genealogies and then you reach a place you realize this is me mean I am the son of I didn't know that now where have I been poor where poverty goes you can't even find you won't even pray for that Lord take away you don't need to pray you don't need to fast because must when you understand what you are will go and say this kingdom is mine I am the [Music] ha he he has acknowledged it he has known it the ones who are ling they will just leave and you sit on the throne in your pockets you don't have even P but what you have you have authority amen you can command whatever you want because you have authority we have been given Authority been given power over scorpion power over we have been a we are been made to know who we are and the more you read the word the more you realize who you are and before you know it the appetites you had begin to drop off you used to you used to have appetite for for for for water now you can't even test it you used to to have you know appetite for Doo used to have that's all you had now you realize the appetite is lost what happened you have realized who you are your are now that is how it happens Christianity is not a struggle that's why you Believers should study the message I'm talking about reading list read the Bible and read the message stud stud the message get into it if you don't you will never overcome God chose us in him that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in David was distin for the throne he had always been a part of God's plan I was the for the throne I was always a part of God I came from God I go back and I see here God announces to SA about David and I I will read it to you and then I'll ask you a question but now 1 13:4 says but now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has s him a man after his own heart and the Lord has commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has kept not kept the word which the Lord commanded thee I want to ask you a question when God was speaking this to sa where was David anybody knows come on now he was in the valley somewhere feeding the ship but God spoke and announc that God s him a man after his your coming here was announced before you came even if your mother tried it they could not not AB you it is impossible you were supposed to be here I was supposed to be here I was announced before and my time has come and I'm here God has announced me before I it doesn't matter where you are that moment but I want to tell you for sure in the mind of God at this time David was stilling the value of his life but God had David in mind he was a part of God's plan when sa was being selected as a King David was a shepherd for ship when David's brothers were Renown soldiers in the Army David was protecting his sheep from bears and [Applause] lions so you would sing David is a loser because his brothers are having better jobs his brothers are in the Army getting better salaries and living Better Lives but David was with the Sheep Bears and Lions coming a ship was very busy protecting little did anyone know including David himself that this suffering that he was in at the time was preparing for the throne amen I want to encourage you brother never Define your life by somebody else I'm a failure because so and so is ahead of me God has a plan for you as an individual it cannot be replaced no one can take your place stand in your place take care of your sheep take care of your little place Ser God Faithfully in your little believe God with all your heart in your little place whatever little God has given to you hold fast to it and do not look at others and feel they are better than you no one is better than me I am me because God wants to and is preparing me for me 2.0 praise God David was despised by his brother I want I want to read for you this portion excuse me out of 1 Samuel 17 ver 28 now here David has gone to take a little porridge of food for his brothers and he left his post for the ship and his father sent him so he obeyed his father and he went to war to take care of his brother so he was also a little erand boy a little erand boy some some of you you feel so despised when they you somewhere brother Dix go and clean those chairs how can they tell me to do they feel that I am despised desable no no no no no no I can't accept please the church and you kind of feel you despised whenever you do that whenever you do that you are delaying your throne brother be humble sister be humble no matter which stat you feel you have David at one time they were stoning him this man stoning him and wanted to kill him he told them leave him alone God has allowed him to do this to me whatever happens to you any way happens has allowed it for a purpose he is molding your character don't become proud don't overrun God stay humble and he in due time your throne will come and so he is even now being sent around and and now listen to this and his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the Man and's anger was kind and he said why thou down and with whom has th left those few sheep in the world have you left with I Know Thy pride and the nness of th heart for Thou come down that thou might see the battle and David said what would you say first put put that up see here the elest brother of David saw David to some man talking about the war and the man's anger was kind why have you come here you little boy why who did you leave those little sheep in the wilderness meaning you are nothing you even the ship you are looking after his few just go back in the wilderness men are talking and you're talking very proud boy and I know
