[10:41] would you sit on the edge of yours
[10:43] you can't wait to hear more
[10:53] hallelujah amen forget about everything
[10:56] where are we able to let us see what the
[10:57] lord has
[11:11] before they receive the holy spirit
[11:31] [Music]
[11:40] now i want you to
[11:48] praise the lord amen you see they have
[11:51] not been called
[11:53] by the lord jesus
[11:55] but they were by by
[11:57] you know by design all my
[12:00] career they were
[12:02] fishers
[12:06] they were made to be fishers
[12:23] erroneous
[12:24] and you have certain uh qualities
[12:30] no one else has
[12:33] you well
[12:35] now that is before you even receive the
[12:37] holy ghost
[12:40] the other time we'll talk about gifts
[12:42] and callings
[12:45] and calling of god without repentance
[12:49] you don't need to be to repent and
[12:51] receive the holy ghost for you to have a
[12:53] gift
[12:57] you have a gift the moment you were born
[13:01] you have abilities the moment you were
[13:03] born
[13:04] with someone
[13:19] found this man and they were fishers yes
[13:22] and he told them come follow me
[13:25] i will make you fish as a man
[13:28] it is not that fishing that is a problem
[13:32] it is
[13:46] [Music]
[14:00] watching
[14:04] he's listening to music but oh what is
[14:07] that music
[14:08] you know
[14:10] when jesus called us yesterday he did
[14:12] not come to make us dummies
[14:42] but what are you watching
[14:44] my hobby is listening
[14:49] i mean but what kind of music are you
[14:52] listening to
[14:54] so what it is
[14:56] so it's what you are doing
[14:58] and where else
[15:04] follow me and i will make you fish out
[15:06] of me
[15:10] you want intended for them to remain
[15:12] fishers
[15:19] but you want the dame to be fishers of
[15:21] men
[15:24] but
[15:31] [Music]
[15:38] james son of zebedee and john yeah
[15:44] and they were mending their nets
[15:46] and they called them
[15:48] and they immediately left their ship a
[15:50] manga
[15:52] and their father went and followed him
[15:55] to next time
[15:57] we are not here in the church this
[15:59] morning the truth
[16:00] is we had nothing to do
[16:05] we are not serving jesus christ that's
[16:07] who it is because we had nothing to
[16:09] listen to
[16:11] we are worshiping and following jesus
[16:14] because this is what we were meant to do
[16:19] some people say i'm going to serve god
[16:21] because i have nothing i had nothing to
[16:23] do
[16:26] if you are serving god because you have
[16:28] nothing to do
[16:31] time will come and you will get
[16:33] something to do and you will stop
[16:34] serving god
[16:39] i am not not a preacher
[16:42] because i could not do business
[16:44] i am not a preacher
[16:46] because i failed in education
[17:14] you know all those things that the world
[17:16] is doing
[17:44] they were
[18:24] oh
[18:57] you know in business
[18:59] you cannot do a business without a risk
[19:01] does somebody call me remove that away
[19:04] you cannot do a business without uh
[19:06] sacrifice
[19:40] jesus is i don't know how to say that
[19:42] jesus question was not to disappoint
[19:44] their life's goals and purpose
[19:56] jesus did not call you
[19:58] so you become
[20:00] a good-for-nothing person yes
[20:32] is it wrong to go in church every day
[20:36] but you must have something you do now
[20:37] you only know
[20:39] that you must work or you're not calling
[20:41] even just himself what no yes
[20:45] right
[20:46] so he did not call us they are treated
[20:49] to disappoint our life's calls
[20:54] if you're in school continue in school
[20:57] business
[21:12] if you're doing a business
[21:40] and he wanted to realign our
[21:42] expectations
[22:11] about when you didn't realize you did
[22:13] not need politics anymore
[22:17] you realized
[22:18] that god had realized
[22:24] here are the disciples
[23:20] but even in this
[24:02] however
[24:15] realigned their aspirations
[24:30] and that
[24:40] you don't need the world to become great
[24:42] the wake again forecaster
[24:47] [Music]
[24:49] [Applause]
[24:58] not sober now
[25:03] they still wear oh hallelujah they were
[25:05] confusing the fish and the fish
[25:12] you need to enter into my spirit now
[25:14] brother because how can you interpret
[25:16] the fish and the fish unless you
[25:17] understand what i'm talking about right
[25:19] they were they were still confusing
[25:23] the fish of the sea
[25:26] and the
[26:04] [Music]
[26:06] and after these things jesus showed
[26:08] himself again to the disciples
[26:11] at the sea of tiberias

[27:32] feed
[27:43] and here jesus has died yes we are far
[27:46] and as resurrected
[27:50] but the disciples
[27:53] have not yet met with them
[27:57] amen
[28:01] and peter
[28:03] quickly forgot
[28:07] and he let the disciples back to their
[28:10] old life
[28:43] peter was that man
[28:46] that commanded respect
[28:51] from the others
[28:52] he was intelligent
[28:54] but he was not educated
[29:08] and he told him i want to make you a
[29:10] fish of mine

[48:45] i have not faith
[49:14] that

[49:57] might as well interpret that for what it
[49:58] says

[50:03] right side of the ship
[50:23] amen what's the right side of it

[52:16] do you really think the whole night when
[52:18] i was a child
[52:20] peter did not even think of casting on
[52:22] the right side of the street
[52:44] so
[52:56] there is a song which says if god says
[52:57] no nobody can say
[53:37] the bible says
[53:39] they called a multitude of fishes
[54:10] malachi malakai chapter three malachi is
[54:14] accepted
[54:16] okay is it chapter three
[54:22] will a man rob god which verse is that

[57:09] these people they cast the whole night
[57:11] but they didn't get nothing i went to my
[57:13] natural neighborhood
[57:15] but when jesus came yesterday
[57:18] they cast their necks
[57:21] and the bible says
[57:23] they were not able to draw
[57:57] now when simon peter had that it was the
[58:00] lord
[58:01] he got his fishes caught unto him for he
[58:04] was naked and he did cast himself into
[58:06] the sea simone petrova
[58:13] i love peter
[58:16] peter is the same man who told jesus
[58:18] you will not wash my feet
[58:20] again

[59:15] [Applause]
[59:30] you
[59:51] [Music]
[59:57] so but they now needed the word to be
[59:59] made manifest in them
[1:00:05] so they to sum them up
[1:00:09] so they can understand their own they
[1:00:10] can stand on their own
[1:00:25] praise the
[1:00:26] lord verse 8 and the other disciples
[1:00:29] came in and in a leadership
[1:00:32] for they were not far from the land but
[1:00:34] as it were 200 cubits dragging the net
[1:00:36] with fishes
[1:00:55] what is fish
[1:00:57] fish is representing
[1:01:00] your expectations
[1:01:03] your aspirations
[1:01:05] your dreams
[1:01:07] your desires
[1:01:08] your prayers
