You see that uh brother and his family are not here this morning. Um um they're announcing the the birth of their newborn. [Music] And uh I love the way he he did it. Said brother, his name is brother Niah Lee and he was born yesterday 22nd and he was weighing 3.76 kg. [Music] That's what you call a bouncing baby boy. you know, this uh baby was a bit a big size &gt;&gt; and I'm just looking for something. uh you know we prayed and um you know they went to the hospital and uh they stayed there for quite a long time before they you know almost more than 24 hours and so um given the circumstances the doctors uh suggested that they go ceserian but um you know we prayed and believed that God could make it go the other way. &gt;&gt; Um but um the last words I spoke now when the the decision was made and you know they had to go ceserian um I I I I you know I was talking to you know they very secretive and never told us what type of baby they were bringing. But you see, as I was talking to him, I told him, "Do not worry. All shall be well with your wife and your boy." And I never knew he was going to have a boy. Well, he laughed. I told him, "Uh, well, what is funny?" Well, it it is now, now I understand they are going to have a baby boy. those words I now because after I said it I was like okay wait did I think about what I said I said well I never thought about it I told Isaac I'm sorry I know I'm not saying you're going to have a boy but but those words are not mine so so God had it in mind and indeed everything was well with the mother Amen. Praise the Lord. So they still in the hospital probably they'll be leaving today. Uh please send them a card. Send them something. Do you know &gt;&gt; when somebody gives birth in a medicine, you should show them that there's &gt;&gt; a preacher who said if you cannot convert people to from the world to God [Music] if you can't go preach evangelize people to get saved. Give birth children to God. That way you can raise them in the fear of. So if somebody gives birth after marrying &gt;&gt; it is good to send them gifts you know &gt;&gt; and you rejoice with them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um u also sister patience. Now before patience um you know greets us &gt;&gt; is that brother here? Brother Dixon. Is he here this morning? No, he's not here this morning. We baptized a brother on is it was it a Monday or Tuesday? I think it was a Tuesday. Yeah, it was a Tuesday. A a brother called Dixon after water baptism. As we were leaving, I saw this lady seated there and I said, "Well, what about you? Would you also want to be back?" I would have wanted, but you are leaving. I said, "Well, we are still here." He said, "Well, long story short, we agreed that she she would come and we talk, fellowship with us, and who knows, I'm sure she will also be baptized." and she's here this morning. &gt;&gt; Is Sister Patience here? Sister Pat. &gt;&gt; Oh, right over here. [Applause] All right. God bless you, Sister Pat. We we welcome you. Let us welcome him with a big round of applause. Amen. Amen. And also sister Martha has her sister that also wants to be baptized. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I I I know the names, but I don't Oh, yeah. Right over here. &gt;&gt; Have you been part of our Okay. But have you been attending our online? &gt;&gt; I know you. I know the name but I don't know you and the name together. So grace. Oh your grace. Okay. Grace. &gt;&gt; You know sister sister um uh and you you want to love what sister Martha did. Sister Martha came to me some time back and told me she had this burden of sending out this message to all our family members. requested that we start an online kind of uh um um you know reaching outreach with them. So all the family members even those in Zambia all around Uganda some other countries are joining in we've had it for how many times? Three three four times and Mr. Grace has been one of those that have been very consecutively attending, very faithfully attending and participating as well. And so today I'm hearing the news that she has decided to be baptized. I think this is wonderful, wonderful. So we we have that program every Saturday on Google Meet. So if you have a loved one or somebody that you want also come and participate and listen we will have it every Saturday until we cannot have it. I think now Sister Grace we have a more reason of continuing. Amen. Isn't the Lord good friends? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. a lot of a lot of things before we go to the word. So sometimes I just want to go to the word but so we have a letter here &gt;&gt; which was brought to us last Sunday &gt;&gt; from restored faith tabernacle restored faith and they inviting us for the for the um they called it the bride's revival convention uh which is going to take place on 4th to 7th September. Let me read a portion of it for this interest of time. Just listen. Dear pastor, Christian, greetings uh in the beloved name of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is with great pleasure and brotherly love that we uh the leadership and congregation of restored faith tabernacle chakaya extend this invitation to you and your assembly for the bride revival convention 2025 to be held from Thursday 4th September 7 to 7th September at Emma high school grounds in Chakaya the theme of this year's convention is lifting him out of history inspiring inspired by the scripture Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever 13:8 we believe this gathering is a divine appointment, a moment ordained by God to awaken the bride and usher in a deeper manifestation of his presence and power in this last day. As the prophet William Brham once declared, this is the hour when the message and the bride with when the message of the bridegroom and the bride is coming together. It is the evening time. It is the time of the restoration is a time of the calling out of the bride. So the convention program will future um worship and um and and you know anointed worship and uh led by consecrated music ministers and inspired preaching teaching by the Holy Ghost field ministers from across the country in intercessory prayer, deliverance, divine healing sessions and under the uncction of the Holy Spirit um uh every evening from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00. I think those um healing services will be in the evenings but uh they will have preaching services from the morning. I was told that and uh so we humbly request the participation of your church in this sacred convocation. Kindly notify us and and so the pastor inviting us John Pastor John Chak. Now I understand that now many of you are wondering well we also already have been invited to another convention which actually I have the invitation here as well from speechb ministries and we already read this to you on 27th of May but uh To me I I think this is a youth convention. This is everybody's convention and uh we as DVF work and cooperate with all these churches. So I'm requesting you as a church to support in both conventions and um and uh to also attend both conventions. Is it possible? Yes. Um from 4th to 7th. Now how many days are those? Three four days. Uh the one of speckled bad is from let me get a dates correct from 8th from 4th to 8th and so um um so you can decide to attend some days here and some days there but one thing I should also um emphasize we are going to have our Sunday morning service You as a a member here, your duty is at your church. when your church is open, you're not expected to be anywhere, but that's going to be only one Sunday morning service and then all these other um you know uh days. We will not have any church program just go and fully participate in this congregation except for Sunday morning. So both uh conventions, both churches have invited us and we want to participate in both. Is that amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh both of them are my friends and um we they also always participate in all our meetings. So we should also do the same. &gt;&gt; Sister Mary be here and be there. a service here and a service there. I think we we should rejoice at the abundance of the blessings for that weekend. Amen. Praise the Lord. And unfortunately, I'm not going to be around that weekend. I'm going to be in Ethiopia. As I already told you, I think a few weeks ago, um we I'm going to be taking a mission in into the northern parts of Ethiopia and then we have a convention and a minister's meeting in the southern part some meetings in the city. Um um personally I will not be around that weekend but Jesus Christ will be with us. I also heard brother Kagan being mentioned of you. God bless you. Your friend Polycap has talked much about you. I'm happy that you are here this morning. So before we go to the word once again, I'd like to sing with my family this morning. When I say my family, I mean those I practiced with last night. But there are many other members of my family that I'm not going to change. So last time I got into trouble doing that. &gt;&gt; So please could you please come uh whoever is ready. Amen. Amen.

Joseph uh is what I have in my mind this morning. But we are going to speak be speaking on son of prosperity part two. Since we only have one service, I usually preach for one hour and um last Sunday many of you were not here. Allow me. Today I might go a little a little more than what I usually do. because I want to get done with this subject today and there are things that God has laid on my heart to share with you as a child. If you can give me your undivided attention, you know, you know, sit down and be in the same spirit, I will not be very long. Usually, even when I go overboard, it's not a very long time. And you know when you're in his presence, even when a preacher speaks for longer than usual, you don't feel it. How many have ever felt that? You can be in church and they tell you he preached for 12 hours. Why? I thought it was 30 minutes. That's what his presence does. You lose track on time. So may God help help all of us this morning. Genesis 39 And we are reading five verses. &gt;&gt; And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Portifer, an officer of Pharaoh, captain of the God, an Egyptian, bought bought him of the hands of the Ishalites, which had brought him down thther. And the Lord was with Joseph, and he was a a prosperous man, and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. and his uh master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand. And Joseph found grace in his sight and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had put in his and all that he had he put in his hand. And it came to pass from the time that he had made him overseer in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake. And the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field. And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand. And he knew not all he had save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was a goodly person and well favored. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can read it now. Fore! [Music] Foreign! Foreign! Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Amen. Amen. You may be seated, please. Tell your neighbor, son of prosperity. Um uh please do not move around. Try to stay in in in the place where you are as much as you possibly can. And um so this morning I'm speaking on son of prosperity and I'm going to go a little fast so that we can be able to uh not take a very long time. So you have to be attentive so you can follow what I'm saying. Brother Emmanuel um sent greetings to you. He's constrained with something and he's not able to be here but I think his wife is here somewhere over here. All right. So we're speaking on son of prosperity. Now when we talk about prosperity um it's been the way it has been presented in our generation has has been in a different way. It has been a different thing whereby you find people coming to church to seek for prosperity but because they do not understand that the prosperity that God gives is different you know it has different principles. The world can make you accumulate wealth but when you are not prosperous. So true prosperity is not the accumulation of wealth. True prosperity is actually advancing, pushing forward. I show I told you that it it comes from the word salak in Hebrew, ancient Hebrew which means to make progress, to succeed, to advance, to prosper. Now not in some things but in all things. Often times in our generation we have many people who are wealthy but they are not advancing. They are not happy. You know because the the way they attain their wealth you know was not from the prosperity that comes from God. So you might be wealthy and still not prosperous and you might be not with a lot of wealth but yet you are prosperous. But when you receive this kind of prosperity, you actually move forward in everything that you do. The spirit of stagnation cannot be where the son of prosperity is. The son of prosperity before I even continue I will tell you is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the son of prosperity. He is the word. But the reason why we read it out here in in in in Genesis 39 is because we see the story of Joseph. Joseph was a type of Christ. And I will do a lot of quoting here and there. you just follow along. And Joseph was a type of Christ, &gt;&gt; you know. And brother Bam here says, "I've hollered at you, you women. I've hollered at you." Now, of course, in many of his sermons, he always talks about women dressing this way, women doing that, women. But then he says, "Now I'm going to take up for you. The woman is the weaker vessel." Yes, I know there can't be a bad man before there is a bad woman. &gt;&gt; But men who knows that men who knows that you are a son of God. Praise the name of the Lord. Men that who know that you a son of God and take advantage of a woman, shame on you. Do I have sons of God here? If you are a son of God and you take advantage of a woman, shame on you, no matter what she does. That's why we don't believe in slapping women. Men, sons of God, believers, we do not beat our wives. We don't brothers. Say, "Amen. We don't beat our wives. We don't mistreat our women. We treat them with honor. We treat them with love as weak vessels knowing they are precious in the sight of God. Amen. No matter what she does, she's a weaker vessel. And you know that if she goes out acting unladylike, take her by the hand and talk to her like a sister. You are a son of God. Don't do them evil things. Look at Joseph. He was an example to you. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Joseph was an example when Portifer's wife This beautiful woman, honorable, highest, one of the highest women there was in the country, begged him and persuaded him. and he turned and she caught him and tried to hug him and he jacked till he even pulled his cord and he ran from her. Yes sir. And when he come in, they told a lie on him said he come in to ravish her and he left his god. And for that he went to the dungeon. But in the dungeon, God was with him. No matter where they put him, there is something about somebody who has the son of prosperity. When prosperity is with you, no matter where you go, God will always be with you. Amen. And Joseph being a type of a son of prosperity. The Bible says everything he did, it prospered. Amen. Joseph prospered when he was with his people. Joseph prospered when he was in the danger. Joseph prospered when he was with the Egyptian. Joseph prospered when he was with a barbarian. Joseph prospered when he was in the hand of in the house of Joseph prospered when he was accused falsely. Joseph prospered when he was thrown into prison. Joseph prospered everywhere he went. Everything he had it prospered. Prosperity means to go forward to succeed. Amen. have succeeded meaning you there is no failure in prosperity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was a type of the son of prosperity. [Music] Everything Joseph done prospered. And when Jesus returns in the millennium, that's the reason the deserts will blossom. as a rose. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God bless you, Sister Rose. The deserts will blossom as a rose. Everything he does will prosper. He's talking about Jesus when he comes back again. Amen. Everything will prosper. Here is the son. Why? because he's the son of prosperity. Everything that Jesus does prosper when he comes back to the earth, there will be no sin. And when Jesus returns, everything will prosper. He's the son of prosperity. Wherever you put Joseph, it was blessed. Wherever Jesus is, it is blessed. So get him in your heart and be blessed. When you receive the oil, when you receive the spirit, when you receive the word in your heart, you will be blessed. You will be a blessing. Everywhere you go, there will be a stump. So and so was here. I don't know about you, but when I was reading about Joseph, I felt like I was reading about me. Wherever you go, there will be blossoming. You will succeed. Am I preaching to someone this morning? You will advance. You will make progress. Maybe you are here this morning and you feel you are stagnant. And some people think to be a believer is to be humble poor and sorry no I don't want to pity you if you feel you are poor you are humble and you feel sorry I am here to remind you that you lost your way a son a daughter of God Even when you have no money in your pocket, you will know I am not poor. I am not poor. But in our generation, in the book, I will get there. In the book of Revelation, he it says that they say, they are rich, increase with good, have need of nothing. Meaning they have everything they need. Amen. But he says they are wretched. They are poor. They are naked. They don't know. But here in this church, we have people who are rich, who are succeeding, who are advancing, who are pushing forward, but they don't know. I have come to tell you, you are not poor. You are succeeding. Stop saying my business is failing. You just created failure. &gt;&gt; Believers, we must know what we are made of. We must know who we are. When you know who you are, no amount of darkness, no amount of misfortune can discourage you to begin confessing negative about yourself. Even when you are sick, you begin, you have to begin by confession. Everything begins by confession and then action. Today, if you give me time, I'm going to give you a principle which will help you in your walk on this earth. Even when you are sick, it begins with confession. I am healed. I am not sick. I am healed. Not because you are not feeling the symptoms. No matter what a doctor say, what does God say? God says something else. What God says is true and is faithful. What they say is not true. What you feel is not true. What God say cannot be felt many times. Cannot be seen many times. Cannot be heard many times. cannot be tested many times. Why? Because that's in the realm of human flesh. The things you can taste, feel, see, touch, hear and not real. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you show me a soul? &gt;&gt; Do you feel a soul? Do you hear a soul? Can you touch it? Do you have a soul that is real? You can see it. You can touch it. You can feel it. You can't hear it. But you know I am a soul. So you believe it. Everything that is real, you only believe it. That's why the Bible says without faith it is impossible to please God. [Music] Now let's continue before you get tired. I want to get continue this in the sixfold purpose of Gabriel's visitation to Daniel. He says here you women I think I read that quote didn't I? &gt;&gt; I did for sure. So now I want to show you Jesus is the word. Now wherever the word is that place is blessed. &gt;&gt; Jesus was the type Joseph was a type of the son of prosperity. Now when you receive the word who is now the son of prosperity and you leave it and just watch and see God will prosper. Amen. &gt;&gt; Brethren, there is something about receiving the word, about believing the word. We have so many Christians who are in churches, but they don't believe the word. The word is not a dogma. The word is not a church creed. The word is not what somebody say. The word is what the Bible say. If it's not the word, walk away from it. And if you believe the word, if you do what the word say, listen church, you will always prosper. Everything you touch will prosper. That is what we call walking in power, walking in authority. [Music] Why? Because you have the son of God. &gt;&gt; Listen, listen. The revelation of Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; I'm going to quote out of that. I say, Joseph loved by his father, but hated by his brother. When Joseph was very young, he was hated by his brethren. Why was he hated by his brethren? It was because he was spiritual. He couldn't help seeing those visions. Nor could he help dreaming dreams and interpreting that was in him. Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall see it later. Whatever you need to prosper when you receive the word, you receive the Holy Ghost is in you. What do you want? Not even need. Oh my. Oh my. Keep pulling whatever you want. It even goes from want. It goes from need to want. It goes to some other level desire. [Music] Whatsoever you desire, I'm not talking about anyone. I'm talking about children of God who have believed the word and have received the Holy Ghost. Now, whatever you desire, you shall have it. That's not my word. That's what the Bible say. He says whatsoever things you desire. Not some everything meaning amen the power or the the money to purchase it is in desire that if you if you desire it, it means there is a deep somewhere to respond. [Applause] You do not have to live below your privileges. What do you desire? Whatsoever you think you desire, if you pray and believe, he says, you shall have it. Why? Because whatsoever you need is in you. &gt;&gt; I wish I can bring it better than that. When God, oh, let me bring it this way. When God wants to give you something, you will know how he puts a desire in there. [Applause] The thing I'm preaching today, if you follow me closely, it will help you in your personal life and it will help us as a church. Right now we are desiring a church life. Me as a person I'm desiring. How many are desiring? Okay. I you as an individual you desire many things some of you do you know that if I call three of you here you have different desire because God doesn't want to give us everything. Some of you are desiring 100 million. to do a certain project. But someone when he hears your desire, may I just desire 5 million. Why? Because your desire is placed there by the Holy Spirit because he knows he has already provided. If you desire something, it means the provision has already been unleashed. It is somewhere. The only thing you need. Amen. That's what I'm preaching about. The only thing you need is to go get it. But how do you get today? I want to show you that. If you follow me well, you will see how you get. But if you have a desire, even when you're praying or fasting for something, you need something you want. That's even why brother said if you're praying for some important thing. Don't wait, how do you know it is the will of God? Don't wait for a vision or a dream or whatever it is. If God deals with you that way, that's okay. But you don't have to wait for a prophecy dream of you. What God will do, you will put a desire in. He will bind you with that thing that you desire. You can't get your mind off of it. You can't get your heart off of it. And you are leaning towards then he says, "Go that direction. Take that direction of your desire. If you are wrong, then the Holy Spirit will correct you. If the mother is in prayer, he will make sure you do not go wrong. Are you not so glad we are babies in his will make sure we do not go wrong? He will lead us. He will guide us. &gt;&gt; Let me say this. He will give us everything. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The reason why I'm happy, I feel he has already provided everything you desire. God cannot inspire a preacher to preach something. If he's not planning to do it. Hallelujah. When a preacher is inspired with trials and suffering, get ready as a church. You are going to go through trials and today he has inspired me to preach about your desire. That means we should get ready. We should get ready because whatever God inspired to bring your way is only because he's planning to fulfill it in your life. Amen. Amen. All right. Listen. Therefore, where was I even? Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; He couldn't help seeing those visions. Therefore his brothers hated him. It was without cause but he was the beloved of his father. His father was a prophet and he understood that was a perfect type of Christ. God the father loved the son. But the brethren, the scribes and the Pharisees hated him. You see how Joseph is a type of Christ. His father loved him but his brother hated him. Jesus the real son of prosperity. His father loved him. The beloved of the father. But the brothers, the scribes and the Pharisees today they are the denominations of they hate him. because he could heal the sick. He could do miracles for a turn the future, see vision, interpret them. That was no reason to hate him. But they did. Unlike Joseph's brethren, they hated him without a cause. Okay. Now, let's go to the second phase of of Joseph here. I'm quoting from the angel of the Lord. Joseph, one of the patriots, sold down into Egypt, perfect type of Christ, betrayed by his brethren, sold for a few pieces of actually I was checking. He was sold for 20 pieces of silver at that time. This was the amount of money that you would buy a young slave. Joseph was a young man and therefore he was bought for the smallest amount. Despised, ridiculed, good for nothing. That's how he was seen by his brethren. Jesus when he come on the scene, that's how he was seen too. &gt;&gt; Judas his very own. went to the Pharisees and the Sadducees his brethren told him I can give him to you just the way they saw Joseph I can give him what will I receive in return they gave him 30 pieces of the smallest amount of money you can buy an adult slave You know slaves also had categories. They were those who were considered better. Maybe they can work better or or they can there other weird things they used to do with than for slaves. And so they if they figured out that this breed is better so they would pay more for it. But Jesus, he was considered good for nothing. 30 pieces of silver just like Joseph, he wore a coat of many colors. That's Joseph as a Christ in Revelation 10 sitting on a throne in Revelation 1 and you know with a rainbow over him. There is seven perfect colors representing seven church ages. Rainbow representing a covenant. He was to look upon as a jasper and sad sad stone which was the raen and Benjamin which is actually the first and the last. He that was and he that is and he that shall come the root and offspring of David. the bright and morning star. Oh, how marvelous. And with a covenant to his churches, seven golden candlesticks behind him. Each candlestick representing a church age. If you read in the book of revelation, you can see this. So Jesus, he was the angel of the covenant. with those colors called of many colors. That's like what Joseph Joseph in prison Jesus on the cross. Two prisoners, one is condemned, one is set free. Joseph, you know something we see with Jesus. Let us read it now back in the revelation of Jesus Christ. Let us examine the life of Joseph where he was in Egypt. For it is here we see him as the perfect type of Christ while in the house of the general. He was falsely accused. He was banished and imprisoned without a cause. Just like they did to Jesus. Are you enjoying this church? They in prison. He interpreted the dream of the battler and the beggar who were also prisoners with him. The battler was restored to life. But the other was condemned to death. Listen church. Christ was imprisoned on the cross just like Joseph forsaken by God, &gt;&gt; forsaken by man on either side was a thief. One died, but the other was granted life. How many remember that the Bible is in symbols? The Old Testament is a shadow of the New Testament. We can actually preach Jesus reading in the life of Jesus. And notice when Jesus was taken off the cross, he was exalted into heaven. And now, oh my, my I love this one. He sits at the right hand over the west spirit of Jehovah. Oh, hallelujah. When Joseph was taken out of jail, he never came out of jail as somebody that was defeated. Joseph came out of jail to become a prince in Egypt. Joseph came out of jail and he was on the right hand of the king. You could not come to the king only through Joseph. If you wanted to talk to the king, please can you bypass Joseph? If you don't go through Joseph, you could not see the king because the Joseph had come out of prison. Why? Because Joseph had been vindicated that there was indeed something in him even if he was nothing. And he went to jail. He went to prison as a nothing slave. But in in prison he proved he is worth what in prison he proved he was more than a slave. In prison Joseph showed he was typing something greater. He showed he was greater than they knew. What was he? He was next to the king. Who could tell? &gt;&gt; Greater than even Portifer. Greater than they knew. Greater than anybody suspected. That's who Joseph was. Jesus when he came and they condemned him. You know he had done nothing but they thought he was good for nothing and they condemned him to death. Who condemned him? &gt;&gt; Pontius pirate spir you people you're not receiving revelation. Are you getting it or you not? Oh sister, I'm happy to see you. But condemned him to prison. Oh my condemned him to the cross. And Jesus when he went on the cross and then went down into prison, in jail, in hell. They thought they were done with it. But you know what? who betrayed. You know the woman, the wife of Bifa is the one who actually lied against him. Lied against him. And then he was taken into the deepest in jail. But they did not know there was something greater in Joseph. There was something that no man could be able to take out. God is God no matter where it is. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You are who you are no matter which condition you are in. Never allow your condition to dictate your identity. Your condition does not in any way talk about who you are. Who you are is defined by the deepest. The people that has been blessed in you by the word of God. Who Joseph was the ticket that took him out of the prison. And when he left the prison, how do you think Portiv's wife looked at him next to Pharaoh in high places? No longer in the places low, but in high places. But he will tell you this, even before Joseph went into high places, he was in high places. Hallelujah. And Joseph treated himself as a man who knew who he was. He never allowed situation to dictate how he behaved. [Music] Some of you something wrong happens in your life. And then you begin having an attitude with everybody. Me, I was not there when that thing happened. So come on, smile. Don't show me attitude. Don't allow situation to determine your attitude. You are a Christian. &gt;&gt; Some of you have forgotten. Let me remind you, you are a son of God. You are a daughter of God. Do not allow situations to determine your attitude. Your mental attitude towards every word of God will bring it to pass. [Applause] You got it. The way you think towards the word of God, towards the promises of God. It will be the one to decide whether it will come to pass. When you say yes, I am more than a conqueror. I am not in hell. I am in heavenly blessing with Christ Jesus. No matter what I'm going through, prosperity is in me. I am rich. I am rich. I am well. I am powerful. I am moving on. I am progressing. I am succeeding. You know when you say these things they you know in in the in the realm of the spirit. There will be the spirit of God to enforce it. [Applause] Listen, we are still talking about Joseph. So Joseph was but when he left the prison he did not leave the prison as a prisoner. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When Jesus went to hell the prison of hell the prison of the cross he never left as a prisoner. When he left he never left as a prisoner. He never left as a condemned. left as a mighty conqueror. He had come on the cross so that it can be seen in his track record that he also conquered the cross. Hallelujah. so that those who follow him can say death where is your victory now we don't fear death because our mighty conqueror conquered death hallelujah so Jesus in his you know when you have a bigger CV no No one can doubt your tracker record in his CV. He also had it that he had conquered the cross and then from the cross. He said I finished that one. Now he said it is finished. It is finished. This part is finished. Some of you have finished some part of a trial and you are going to the next level. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. He said it's finished now. Satan bring more. And the devil thought he will come to hell and I'll finish him. I can finish all the others. But the moment he dropped into the prison of hell and he said, "Well, I've not come here to be defeated, but I've come here &gt;&gt; to conquer." Hallelujah. Let me ask you a question. If you are in a certain kind of hell, what is your attitude? What is your attitude? You are in a hell where your business is going into tatters where you have a lot of debts. Maybe you are in a hell where you have failed to get a husband. You have failed to get a wife. You are confused. You have no money. You have no school fees for your children. You have no money to eat at home. You are confused. And I prophesy this morning. If you are in that hell, you are there to conquer. Hallelujah. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You are there to conquer. Don't just look at me. You should conquer by saying amen. Amen. Amen. Why does he let things happen? Because he want us to also be like him to be conquerors like he and then he went to hell. He knocked on the head. No one open it. He found it open. He entered in. He told Satan, "I have come. I am the virgin born son of God. I have come to take over." And then he said to him, "Get him a key and a knockout punch." &gt;&gt; And he said, "Give me the key." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Sister fortunate. &gt;&gt; Sister. &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you, brother. You know, it's our time right now to give the devil and give him a king. Tell him, "You know what? You have no keys to give us &gt;&gt; because the keys were already taken from you. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Our mighty conqueror has the keys. He is the one that can open. He is the one that can close my life. Not in the hand of any stand. Hallelujah. [Applause] Hallelujah. And so he went in as a conqueror &gt;&gt; and came out &gt;&gt; and he conquered death. He conquered hell. He conquered the grave. And then when he rose up, the Bible says, he is seated. Amen. On the right hand of the majesty on high like Joseph. I feel like shouting. I have no place to shout. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Joseph was seated on the right hand not physically. It means he had authority. He was the next Jesus being on the right hand. It means authority. power. He has all authority all that the father had all in. No man can come to the father. But through the son and the bible says if you have the son you have the father only. But if you don't have the you don't have the father. If you want to go to go through Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many understand what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; Praise God. I notic when Jesus was taken off the cross, he was also exalted and he was given an a name. &gt;&gt; I was 14 but these words came to me above every name. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. There are the mention of the name Jesus. Every knee shall bow. Every tongue shall confess. That's why if you are not baptized in that name, you must be baptized again. If you are not sure you are baptized like that, be baptized again water in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the name of our mighty conqueror. We are the true Jesus people. [Applause] No man can come to God except by him. There is one mediator between God and man and he is all you need. There is no Mary's or saints just Jesus. Everybody shout Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Everything he did in Egypt prospered. Keeping on with the type we find in Joseph. Notice how that everything that they did he did in Egypt prospered. His first job with the general prospered. Even the jail prospered. Even if you are a house boy or a house or you are helping somebody something whatever you are doing right now do not despise it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you are you you a Christian and you have Jesus in your heart you have prosperity in you. Amen. Prosperity is not coming. No man gives it is not a thing. He is a person. Hallelujah. When he comes in your life, you may be a rider, but you'll prosper. You may be a teacher earning small salary. I will show you here, but you'll prosper. You may be a widow. Prosper. You may be an engineer with no good job but you will prosper. You you are a student. You will prosper. Good grace. Good grace. Good grace. Why? Because you have the son of prosperity. [Applause] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the jail prospered. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Some of us, &gt;&gt; we need to tell the devil that the prison you've put me in this hell you're putting me in, you don't know what you're doing to me. Why? Because the devil will find himself. The prison will start prospering. Hallelujah. Yes. I thought I brought them here to persecute them. Some of you when you in a in hell, when you're in a trouble, you forget that you a Christian. Don't tell me don't if Jesus is with me, why am I suffering? Why is this test and that one? He's allowed it to You know who you are. Amen. Because &gt;&gt; if you know who you are, &gt;&gt; you will know that that is not your place. &gt;&gt; Even the people who put you, &gt;&gt; you will know that is not your position. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. When Jesus returns, the day that will blossom, he is the son of prosperity has no age ever pro prospered as the one under Joseph. So there is not such a time. So there is s there is a time of such blessing coming on this earth as the world has never known. [Music] The golden age President Trump is thinking about. He's just dreaming. It is only Jesus to bring you physically in the millennium. If you don't you go in the rapture, you'll be there to see. But if you remain in the tribulation, I'm sorry you'll miss it. There is a time coming such a blessing coming on this earth as the world has never known. We can every one of us sit under our own fig tree [Music] and laugh and laugh. You don't laugh unless you're happy &gt;&gt; and rejoice and live forever in his presence. In his presence is the fullness of joy and on his right hand there are pleasure forever more. [Music] Praise God. That's why here on earth when we enter into his presence, you feel joy coming. You begin shouting, you begin jumping. Why? Why? In his presence in the fullness of joy. Have you ever been worshiing or praying and you're so happy you're like I wish this would not go away. How many have they ever experienced? Oh god. I wish I remain like this but after 1 2 3 4 hours and you feel tired. Slowly by slowly you come back to normal. But I tell you what, when we walk into that millennium, we will be in that presence forever. We shall laugh. We shall rejoice. We will sing and we will shout. When the redeemed are gathering, &gt;&gt; when the redee sing with me, &gt;&gt; wash like snow and free from see nothing. I will shine. Oh, you see now I will say when the redeemer are gathering. &gt;&gt; Did you notice you can't sing that cross when you're sad? [Applause] Hallelujah. Turn your neighbor, tell them that time is coming. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Wherever Joseph was, a trumpet was sound. And everyone bowed. And notice now, everywhere Joseph went, they sounded a trumpet to announce his arrival. The people would scream. They would bow a knee to Joseph. No matter what a man was doing. When that trumpet sounded, he bowed the knee. No matter what he was doing, he could have been selling something in the street, just reaching out for his money, reaching out for his money or maybe receiving whatever. But he had to stop and bend a knee just reaching out and then back when the trumpet blew. If he were even a performer or an actor, he would have to stop his eye and bow the knee to Joseph when his presence was announced with that trumpet. When the trumpet of the Lord shall sound, when the morning breaks eternal bright, the redeem of earth shall gather over on the other shore. When the roll is called a beyond, I'll be there. And one of these days everything in time will stand still when the trumpet of God shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise and the morning will break a t of bright everything will bow the knee then for it is written. Tell your neighbor is written written. Come on now. someone does in television. Wherefore God also has highly exalted him and given him what? &gt;&gt; Given him what? &gt;&gt; A name which is above every name. A name which is above every name. &gt;&gt; Let me stop right here for a moment. A name which is above fear. Then fear is a name. Sickness is a name. HIV is a name. You know infection is a name. Blindness is a name. You get a point. Poverty is a name. Mention it. Lust is a name. Old is a name. You know fear. Oh fear. Anxiety. Anxiety. The devil wants to keep you anxious all the time. You're fearing what you don't know. You don't know what will happen to you. So you're in fear. I don't know what will happen. Those are names that the devil's names. Then the Bible say he rose again. He gave him a name above every name. A name above all those name mention of the name Jesus. Every knee should bow. Every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things. [Music] [Applause] Everything must bow at the mention of the name. Brother Kagan, this name is powerful. Healing is done in that name. That's why even water baptism must be in that name. If you are not baptized in that name, don't you worry. You are here and you have heard it because he loves you and is calling you. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You see, every tongue should confess, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, that Jesus is Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, if my sickness had a tongue, the sickness must come. &gt;&gt; That Jesus is Lord. [Music] &gt;&gt; Do you have some fears in your heart? Can you begin to say whatever your fear is? Fear. You must confess that Jesus is Lord. I'm no longer fear. &gt;&gt; I am God. &gt;&gt; Have no fear. [Music] Why? &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Glory. &gt;&gt; Because you have the son of prosperity at the mention of his name. When they call you, they calling him. Hallelujah. When he returns on earth, it will be a land of prosperity. The old deserts will blossom. And there will be food everywhere. And we can everyone sit under our own fig tree and live forever in his presence. when he comes back as a king. But I tell you what, there's something that I want to go into another phase before we conclude. It will happen. But I'm telling you, he's already here. Amen. Christ has been divorced from the denomination. He has been rejected just like Joseph. He has been scorned. You talk about water baptism in Jesus name. They'll begin talking about the trinity. They'll begin bringing their dogmas and they'll begin talking about infant baptism. They will reject the word. It is Jesus Joseph rejected by his brethren. The Bible says with their mouth they worship me but in their heart they have me they have a form of godliness but they have no fear they have rejected him you see that's why we see what we are saying men and women are confused they have forgotten their place you find them in their churches you know dancing All the kind of dancing that are supposed to be danced in the club and they're dancing it in the church in the church. They have rejected him. They have rejected the son of brother. They may say we are rich. We have a big church building. We have a lot of money. We have this. We have that. They said but he said they are poor wretched naked and they don't know. You see it's all about entertainment. It's not about the word. It's not about Christ. A woman has lost her place. When pastor is the pastor, his wife is the assistant. Oh, please join your hand. Let us welcome to Pastor Rebecca. Who told you there's nothing like a past? &gt;&gt; Yes, I When God calls a man, he calls his wife. But everyone has their different roles. A man can't stand alone. He needs his wife. But his wife has a roles. I'm not talking about today's whatever. I'm talking about the word. You see, when you see their nails, it will be like as if they want to remove your eyes. And then you wonder why didn't God make you that way like an eagle. I wonder how they even do hygiene or how do they wash us friends is a spirit of loud disease that would take you away from the word. The word says you are fearfully and wonderfully made [Music] in this church. We preach you appreciating who you are. Forget about being who you are not. This is the age of cociousness. Everybody wants to be like somebody else. People have lost their identity. You know someone even who has a beautiful dark skin, they want to be white. They have good, beautiful, nice black small hair. They want to be like Beyonce. It's a spirit of the air. Pastor, is it breaking the word? Listen, when you are when you are led by the Holy Ghost, is no longer written or not written. The Holy Ghost will lead you to what God intended. All things are lawful for us. There is nothing binding us. But all things are not expedient. &gt;&gt; Know who you are. &gt;&gt; When you know who you are, No one will tell you how to dress, how to behave, what to say, what not to say. God will lead you. We are not legalists. We are following the spirit. Can we say amen to that? They have rejected the word. They have kicked him out of their church. You see, you find brothers, boys, as young and handsome as this dressing like girls and walking like it's a disgrace in our generation. What is all about is a spirit of paneer. Go research it. It's a spirit that has come to you know spoil their mind to make them go after the rudments of the world. You see and then on the other side you find women don't also want to dress like the devil has taken them and addressed them. He will the best he can do to cover their body is to make them wear men's trousers otherwise he will undress them friends we are ina and even by speaking these things many will feel like I'm trembling on their Right? [Music] But you see the Bible means people's rights. But this message we are preaching come to pull us out of bring us in Christ. When they reject the word they reject him. They are saying they are rich increase with good and have need of nothing. He say they are poor, rich, blind, naked. They don't know. He has spewed them out of his mouth because they rejected his word. Then he sends Malachi 4. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To do what? To gather the bride of his word. Amen. She must be restored. this message of the hour that we are preaching. By the way, we are not the only ones. If you are visiting today, &gt;&gt; I'll let you know we are not the only ones preaching this. There are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all flame. Come on, sing it. &gt;&gt; You are telling somebody who did not know them clean. It is burning now within my heart. All glory to his name. &gt;&gt; Well, I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them. They are all over the world. All over the world. Literally every city on earth. I said, "Pastor, we are a Bible church. [Music] We are non denominational. We're just Christians. That's exactly. And if you search and read your Bible, you will find. That's exactly how Paul was, how Timothy was, how Peter was. So these are our denominations. We don't know where they came from. But what I care about is the word. [Applause] Because the Bible is our absolute. This message of Yahweh resto his presence back to us. It is a message. Hey, of prosperity. Hallelujah. Now I am beginning my sermon which I'll preach for 20 minutes. It is a message of prosperity. Tell your neighbor the message of prosperity. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Glory. This message which is the word which is Christ is a message of prosperity. Because who is the son of prosperity? It is Christ in you. &gt;&gt; The hope of glory, the hope of prosperity. As Christ was the first one to rise from all the prophets and so forth. Although typed in many places, he was the first fruits of those that slept. In the bride coming of Christ, coming out of the church, there will be a shift again in the last days. Waving of the she was the shift. The first one that come to mature, the first one that proved it was a weak. and pay proved it was a shift. I am sure you see what I'm talking about. It was welded over the people and the first time there will come forth for the bright edge for a resurrection out of dark denominationalism. There will be a message that the full maturity of the word was turned back again in its full power and being waved over the people by the same signs and wonders that he did back there. Now follow me now. The best part of the services around this area. If you miss it, you miss everything. Oh, I wish I would get into explanation, but without listen. God has to send a prophet with a message of restoration back again to the world. From where? &gt;&gt; From darkenominations. He brought me out from the mic and he put me on the rock. How many of you know? No, God picked us out and he put us on the rock of the word. You understand? So we are not of those that are still in Saturn's Eden. No, we are not. We are not a part of any denomination. Christ is coming to rapture the a word bride. When and how will he gather a word bride? He will always send a a word prophet. When God sends a prophet, the purpose is one to prosper you. A prophet from God will speak nothing but the truth of the word. Amen. Not that comes even to every preacher. Every preacher that has been sent from God will not come to entertain the people will come to teach the word. I don't know about you. When I go to church to sit down and listen to the word, I don't want to hear stories. I want to hear nothing but the word. He will have thus sayeth the Lord. Amen. And thus say the Lord never failed not even once. Show me in the Bible where God sent a prophet and he come with thus say the Lord and it failed. Thus say the Lord never fail. Amos 3:7 Surely God will do nothing but he reveals his secrets and serve as the prophet. The message is in Christ. Whatever God sends it will do what? The message will move on will prosper, will succeed and it will be like wild. No man can stop. When I was going to Ethiopia to preach this message, there was no believer in that country that we knew of the message. And a man told me, "Oh, you can't come here. It's very difficult. You have no money. You are poor. You don't know the language." He told me many things and you were young. He was true in everything he said. But it was true except he didn't say I had the son of prosperity. I had believed the message sent to us by the prophet of Malachi 4. How many have that message in their heart? When you believe that message, that message is Christ. Wherever you go, you have to prosper. You have to prosper. Are you getting what I'm saying? [Applause] My wife and I arrived in a strange country. No one we knew. But you know what? I don't remember dear was it the following day or the following week. The first weekend we met our first contact and that man heard this message. He said, "This is the truth. I want to be baptized." We baptized that manapt and he came out of the water, brought somebody else, brought somebody else, brought somebody else. And now there are hundreds of believers all around the country. And you know what? Then the government says, "Oh, you can't stay in Ethiopia because you have no uh Bible college certificate certific." And so I told him, "Yeah, I don't have it." So it's all right. I'll go back to my Some people said, "You can forge it. You can even go to Bible college." I'm sorry. God never set me with Bible college. Keep me in this country by Bible college. God never teaches any man by Bible college. Bible college. Bible college only teaches you church traditions and dogmas and Greek. If you want to know how God trained, he trains him by the word and in the back side of the desert where you meet God face to face. God has sent me. I told him, "God sent me here. I will not stay if it's a Bible college. I have to go back home." So he went back. We came back. Now people thought everything was going to be destroyed. But the work instead increased. There's something I'm trying to come to. It's not about me. I'm showing you something. The message is a seed. The truth is a seed. When you have received it, no man can pluck it away. [Applause] Hallelujah. No man can do it. And and everywhere it goes, there will be prosperity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How many were here when we first came here in this place? Raise up your hand. Just a few. You remember how this place? Everybody say, "Son of prosperity." Now, now you're beginning to understand the message. It's not the man. It's not you. It's not me. It's the message in Christ in you. Wherever you go, if you are a believer, prosperity must follow. Hallelujah. You must succeed. Don't say this job is very hard. you will succeed. Whatever you need has already been given you. You don't need any man to favor you. God has already favored you by sending you Elijah by giving you the message of the hour by calling you out of darkness setting you in his word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Second Kings chapter 4. This is where we are going to climax now. Praise the name of the Lord. Amen. I want to show you an example of what I'm talking about. Let us now take it practically. Second Kings. Father, give me the verses vers one. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elishah. By the way, we need a screen. &gt;&gt; We need a screen here. Right there somewhere right there somewhere. I need a screen. So if you God moves on you, please do it so that sometimes the song leaders don't know the words, want to look at or the preacher turn. Praise the name of the Lord. Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets. And to Elisha said, "Thy servant, my husband, is dead, and thou knowest that thy servant did fear the Lord." and the creditor. and a creditor. &gt;&gt; Who understands who a creditor is? If they have never demanded money from you, you don't know what somebody can do and you really want to die and the creditor is come to take unto my unto him my two sons to be bond men. Here is a woman, a woman of God. She was married to a man of God, but her husband was now dead. And now when he saw prophet Elisha, you remember prophet Elisha had the anointing and the spirit of Elijah a double portion. And you know the message we are preaching is a message of Elijah. Hey when he saw prophet Elishah she ran and told him hey my husband is And you know him, you knew him. He was a servant at the world. But the creditors, the creditors, they come, they want to take my two as slaves. And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for thee?" Ask your neighbor, "What shall I do for you? Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe you are also having a character. Maybe you have many problems which you can say pastor if I begin my problems I can't finish them. And pastor that's even why I you know you want my in my heart I really want to serve God and attend church every Sunday and and give to to all these projects the church is doing and everything but I'm a widow I have no job and I have credit if I begin to tell you my problem I can't finish that. &gt;&gt; Now let me tell you what the problem is with you. You do not know what you have in you. Hallelujah. The problem is not that the situation you are saying is not true. But if you will ever have a reason not to serve God, it is only because you do not know what you have. Ah, I'm praying that as I speak this word, the Holy Spirit will reveal it to you. What we have is a sign of prosperity. What we have is the oil. The message is Christ. The message is the spirit. It's the spirit that does the work. It's not you. It is him in you, Christ in you, the hope of glory. You are hopeless. But when you have Christ in you, you become hopeful. You even begin to see activities you never thought you had. You begin to realize you are greater than you knew. You begin to realize that are laying down in you more than you thought. The only way to activate those potentials is first realizing what you have. [Music] [Applause] What I'm telling you tonight is the principle number one of prosperity. May God reveal it to you. My time is almost going down. Let's push on here. And Elisha said unto her, "What shall I do for you, woman? Tell me." And the woman never answered. until until the prophet of God said, "What hast thou in the house?" Ask your neighbor, "What do you have? What do you have? What do you have in the house? What do you have in the house? What's your house? &gt;&gt; I wish I had time, but let me What your house, your body, soul, spirit. But I'm talking about the man in the middle of the man. I'm talking about the deepest in you. I have Christ. I have the oil. I have the word. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? &gt;&gt; What do you have in your house? And she said, &gt;&gt; thine handmade does not have anything in the house. That is our problem. The problem of the church is they do not understand that the things they see are not real. But the things they don't see are real. Brethren, if we are going to serve God, we have to grow. We cannot remain children forever. We have to understand how God runs his kingdom. Amen. If God wants to prosper, you as an individual, I tell you, he cannot unless you you in your heart, you are purposed obey his word to run his kingdom. Then when he sees that that it's not about you, then he will activate the son of prosperity which will take care of all the problems you have and the problems you never thought you have. I am going to speak a few statements in a few moments before I close. I didn't know but I've just known now but I want you to tie your belts right now. Those who are visiting us this morning I don't always speak these words but you know what the church is changing faces and we as a congregation need to know where we are headed. We need to know how it is done. How is it? How is it done? How do you make that son of prosperity to work for you? How does it work? That's what I want us to know in just a short while. Follow me closely here. So the woman said, "I have nothing." We always see in terms of money. We always see in terms of wealth. But God doesn't see that. God sees in terms of the deepest in your heart. If you truly say you are who you say you are, you have something in you to prosper you. Hallelujah. But you need to receive the revelation. You need to catch the vision. [Applause] &gt;&gt; So the woman said, "I have nothing." except the little pot of oil. Someone needed to tell this woman. That's all you need. Hallelujah. That's all you need. That's all you need. Forget about what you don't have. Look at what you have. Because what you have is all you need and what you don't my &gt;&gt; as I'm speaking to you I am just busting into revelations right now. Then he said follow this story. Then he said, then he said, you would think that this man of God at such a time with such a widow, he would just activate his prophetic power and cause this woman is there to be cancelled [Music] like the prophets of today. I cancel your debt. How do you cancel that? &gt;&gt; I am going to show you today true debt cancellation. If you have debts, they are going to be cancelled. But in the way of the word, sister, you better be very fast and not miss. Listen now. Praise the name of the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet said, &gt;&gt; "Woman, I cancel your debt." Woman, a praise, a blessing. Many times you are going through a tough time. You are rushing to the pastor to pray. Let me tell you, anything to do with substance, never pray about it. Do something about it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are you following me? So the prophet said, "Go borrow the vessels abroad of all the neighbors. Empty empty vessels but not a few. &gt;&gt; Okay. What is God trying to do? Something is happening at that moment. Listen. There is a twofold mystery unfolding. one the woman doing what the prophet said exactly the way he said who told what the prophet to say why not the woman see but prophet Elisha why didn't we agree first and then so you can tell me to do what I am able No. God doesn't work like that. God leads his own man. Amen. Who told Elisha what to say? God told him what to say. God told the church. Let them go out and gather empty vessels. And he said, "Go, gather empty vessels. Make sure they're empty. bring them. &gt;&gt; What? This is a woman. She She's a widow. She's old. She's poor. Maybe she doesn't have associate. How will she do it? How will she carry it? She wasn't supposed to do it with somebody else. It was only by herself with her own hand. She had to do this. She had to obey. So the twofold mystery is one she went and did what the man of God said exactly what he said. Two she obeyed the voice of the prophet. Both those things were difficult. I don't have I have creditors and you're telling me to go and borrow more. Man of God, what's wrong with you? The man of God is trying to tell us this is the way to become prosperous. I'm giving you a key woman. But in the process, the prophet never told her that this is what is going to take you out of your debt. He simply told her what to do. But many even today they don't take care what God tells us to do. Well, the vision of the church, let the pastor handle it for us. We have issues stressing. If I look at my dates now and then what sincerely things also &gt;&gt; they are becoming hard why can't I change a church don't do these kind of things I'm not kind of brother I'm inspired what I'm speaking right Amen. &gt;&gt; When you do that, you are not like this woman. You've not understood how it works. But I want you to follow and see how it works and then we we will finish. What did he say? &gt;&gt; So the woman went and borrowed many vessels as much as she can get. She suffered. She went abroad. I don't know abroad. Is it Kenya or I don't but she went as far as she can go. Please borrow me. I'll return. He didn't even tell her what to say. It's not none of the prophet's business. Just go and borrow. There's something you can do. If you have something, there is something you can do. Tell your neighbor, "If you have something, there is something. And if you have nothing, you just don't know. You just don't have the revelation." And I hope that God will give it to you. and she borrowed it and brought it. And when you are coming, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and you will power out into those vessels. Not No, this has to be a personal revelation. Shut yourselves outside. Shut everybody outside. Come in. I won't do it for you. Woman, you yourself bring those vessels after you filled it up. Now, hey, there's something now. Begin to pour into those vessels. And thou shalt set aside that which is full. The prophet brother was creating [Music] without telling the woman. Okay? If you don't understand what I'm saying, brother, come. Come, come, bring that bottle. See what I'm saying, brothers? Come up. Come up. Come up. You're a very good singer, are you not? Stand right here. I love your boldness whenever you're singing. So now, this is a small bottle. This is the oil she had. The only one she had. But these are big. Do you have big empty ones? Now, this was empty. All those of you who are outside, come in. Come in. Come in. If you can't hear me properly, come in cuz this you must get it. And then man of God, he told her power begin powering. [Music] You see what he's telling him to do? It is impossible. God specializes in impossible to make it possible. The vessels were big. The oil she had was small. But this woman had to have such faith to believe in what the man of God said. She did not have to question anything. She had to believe and do by faith. And the man of God say every vessel that is full you can set aside aside. Which means the man of God created a little oil will fill all the empty vessels one by one. One by one by one. And it will all be done by her. and the woman obeyed. So she went from him and she shut the door upon her and her son who brought the vessels to her and she poured out. And it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son, friends, as I was reading this scripture, I know I can take it many different ways. Scripture has compound meaning. But God gave me a Rama word for the church. If there was a service I never wanted streamed is this one because this is for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; For you members of this fellowship. Amen. And so listen carefully. And so it came to pass when the vessels were full that she said unto her son, "Bring me yet a vessel." But listen, and he said unto her, "There is not a vessel more." And the oil stayed. Now let's go close. This woman, why did she have to send for more vessels? Because what she had brought in earlier was according to the revelation that she had. When she realized that this works, she wanted to go beyond her revelation. It couldn't work. Her son's revelation is not hers. Her son immediately told her there is not even one more. He didn't catch it. If only he had caught it, they would have had much more oil. But he didn't catch it. And she if only she had brought in a lot more, a lot more a lot more. &gt;&gt; She would have been much more worthy, [Music] but she did not go beyond her revelation. And so the man of God came and said, "Go sell the oil and pay thy debt and leave thou and thy children of the rest." She never asked for money. to live day by day. But what was given her to live day by day was on the basis of how much and many vessels she collect by faith. when she had nothing. I have other quotes. I'm no longer going to read. I'm done preaching. And now this is for the church. So if you are streaming this none of your business, brethren, as I was studying in my office and praying and and knowing what God can do and what God has done before and discussing with many friends and what God has done in other places, it brought me to a place Are you not the same God? And at first I was like, "Oh, God, if it was possible, I would never want anyone in the church to give any of their subject. I would want to do everything. Lord, if you can give me a big business and I sponsor all the youth meetings and buy the land of the church, the people come and I just give them the word. &gt;&gt; And it was right there that the Holy Spirit began to minister that that's not how it works and it took me to this scripture and you can tell that this is very emotional for me. It took me to this scripture and as I read it over, he began to, you know, minister to me personally. And I preached it to my my my family. It stirred my revelation. And by the time I started preaching son of prosperity, I even had not seen like got the inspiration of it. And then he began to minister to me. He said this is exactly what I have already revealed to you. listen to do and to instruct the church to do. And if you notice on Sunday, I talked about the plan, but I never went into details because I was still struggling. But Lord, is this your way? Are we fulling putting for money? Are we not stressing the people? People have problems. People have issues. And then when I saw this scripture, it all opened up. And I tell you what, this is not my revelation. This is the inspiration from the Holy Spirit for the local church here. What God wants to do with us and for us. Anybody that will walk into like this woman, you're going to pay your debts. Not only that, you are no longer going to need in your home in the manner you have been needing because the son of prosperity will be activated in your own home. Hallelujah. And then I began to ask Lord how is it going to then you know I called the brother spoke to them and it looked hard it looked difficult but I said well I'm going to tell them and with with the well even what has already been accomplished even what has already been accomplished I can say it is God is not our ability it has been God he has led us From day one when we were in the home fellowship when we moved all the way up there in the small place we moved here. Everybody's not here. If everybody's here, we no longer have enough chairs. So we have already filled up the space. So we need a place of and but I was began to think what has happened is not a man. It is God. The piece of land which we have acquired that place where it is not a man. It is God. It is God. How many remember when I told you about the you know seeing this place and before we even came here? Yeah some people remember. But Martin, do you remember before we paid that price the the the the place, the land which we now have? What did I tell you? Do you remember when I told you the construction and everything? Do you remember? You don't. Is that brother Martin? Do you remember about that construction which I told you? &gt;&gt; All right. As I say, you you'll remember cuz this is way back before we even came in this area. You know, I saw a construction and at this construction, I was walking over it. But it was that this is the place where we were going to have our church. So I saw it way back when I was still in Mitan. I told it to my wife. I told it to brother. Have you remembered now or you've not remembered? &gt;&gt; Huh? Louder, brother. &gt;&gt; You've remembered. Okay. So, so then I was like, but I don't know because I don't know whether this is a place because it might be another place. But when I went that place, I think it was either before after taking you there, I we saw that big iron sheet. and and I walked I wanted to I was curious to see what are they doing. So the man told me that this entire piece of land is actually the same same owner but he sold that piece to somebody else. Uh where's brother Neville? Are you here? You remember when he went to search it he found the same piece of land. So now when when I went there, I started walking over the foundations of the building. They're building it. It's like a &gt;&gt; What kind of building are they building there? &gt;&gt; Apartment. Yes. &gt;&gt; So it's a large building and as I was walking I started remembering this looks familiar. Where did I see? I remembered. So, so I start asking the Lord, could this be the place? Could this be the place? Turns out that we buy that exact place and I walked over the foundation the building as I had seen much earlier. So, I have no doubt that God is leading us. I have no doubt that God is leading us. And so now with all this money remaining, 120 million shillings, it's a lot of money for us, as young as we are, as small as we are. So a few people came to me said, "Pastor, some people are worried because they're saying if we were raising this 100 million in many years, How are we going to raise 120 million in 6 months? It's hard. &gt;&gt; It's hard. Is it going to be possible? &gt;&gt; And that's that's why it took me into this kind of agonizing. And as I was reading this scripture, started to interpret it. The Holy Spirit would begin to interpret it to me. And um let's let's read it now. This is a remma for us here as a church. And I want to do it over again now interpreting it for you. Um let let us look at verse one. And this is very very important for us. &gt;&gt; There cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets unto Elisha. Thy servants my husband is dead and thou brother just do it with me. And thou knowest that the thy servant did fear the Lord. And the creditor has come to take unto him my two sons. to be born men. And this is how it is with us, many problems. Some of you business people, I know you have creditors, it's not easy financially. And and now with all these burdens, we have to get funds for the land of the church in such a short time. What are we going to do? And this is what Elisha told her. What shall I do for thee? What hast thou in the house? And then the Lord began to minister to me. Whatever the people need, they already have, they simply need to activate. &gt;&gt; We have the son of prosperity. We have Jesus. We don't have a lot of wealth, but we have Jesus. We have the word. We have a burden. We have an assignment. We have a world to help. We have sinners to save. We have a gospel to preach. We have a cause. We are not a causeless church. We have a cause. We have a burden. And this is what we have. And also God has blessed us with a little what we call mega fair. Some some of you are simply even help to come here to church supported with transport a few young ones here not everybody but you know what I'm saying is we don't have a lot but you see that's what we have. &gt;&gt; All you have is a meal for your children. All you have is rent. All you have is a little to pay these bills and that. And that's why you say I have nothing. Save a pot of oil. Save a little. But then he said, "Go borrow these vessels abroad of all thy neighbors are even empty vessels. Borrow not a few." And these verses is exactly what we are doing. Brother, brother brother Dan tried to explain for the church and and this brother Neville, you know, uh and and and you know to to have everybody do something. And so um but even if we say that everybody does something, not everybody is having the same amount of faith. And then God began to minister to me. It's not according to what they have. It's according to their faith. Not according to what they have, but according to their faith. We have weeks everybody's going to collect. Brother Dan said to us that um and I didn't plan to say these things this way but I was constrained by the Holy Spirit. We need 120 million finish up that line. But what we decided to do and I came and announced to you here what we have decided to do is to pass it out to the church. Everybody, let everybody go and collect vessels. Just listen. Not a few, but according to their faith, as much as they can collect. I don't care how you got the money. Just don't steal. But you see, these are empty vessels. So it's not cash, &gt;&gt; it is pledges. &gt;&gt; How much are you contributing? Come here. &gt;&gt; How much did you did did you pledge to give &gt;&gt; towards the land fund? 1.5. Now brother Shalom here has no job yet. He's still in school. He is doing a few projects here and there. But he has collected a vessel 1.5 million vessels. That is as much as he can gather. And that is according to his faith. It's according to his faith. Do you have the money? No. Do you know how you're going to get it? Maybe with the projects that I'm doing. &gt;&gt; Are you allowed, brother? &gt;&gt; Maybe through the projects that I'm doing. &gt;&gt; Maybe. So, you're not sure? &gt;&gt; I'm not embarrassing him. He's a minister, so I'm using him as an example by faith. He has collected 1.5 million vessels. They are vessels, but empty. It's not real. There's nothing in there, but it's an empty vessel. And so the Holy Spirit ministered to me that every pledge anyone is going to make towards that purpose of the land fund will be seen as that vessel that they will bring. By bringing a pledge, you will be bringing your empty vessel. You don't give because you have, but you are giving by pledging an empty vessel because you want to be fil. And then it continued on. It said, "Close out everybody. Close out everybody. Close out your son, sister Rose. This is nothing about your son or your sons. It's nothing about your sister or your brother. This is about you. You need a job. You you you need a wife. You need a husband. You need to pay your rent. You need a house of your own. You you you need to petition for your children because you need a Lord. Bring your vessels and shut everybody out. Do not let someone's lack of revelation hinder your revelation inside of what God has revealed. Shut everybody out. That's when things begin to happen. Follow closely. When you shut everybody out, that's when you begin to give. Because you see, we said if you pledge 5 million, we don't expect you to bring it at a goal. &gt;&gt; We expect you to bring it in small amounts every week, 50, 100,000, 200,000, as much as God shall shut everybody out and bring what you can. What you can is not coming from anywhere. It is already in you according to the grace that God has given you by revelation. When you give it as a seed, not because you have maybe I don't know but you see what you need to give the little you need to give that God has already provided for you. 2 million but maybe this week you have given 20,000 and honestly in your heart this is the best you can because God provided to you and the woman began she's alone one week this now for DVF I've not known a message minister that is doing what I'm doing, but I'm doing it because the Holy Spirit has revealed and I'm a very stubborn man. When the Holy Spirit reveals to me something, I don't care what anybody. So, what I'm doing now for you is to help you understand how you are going to pay your creditors. How to activate the son of prosperity that is in you. Weak faithfully power into each body. Power into each body. Be faithful. Be diligent. Don't do it halfaphazardly. I don't have it without failure. Power in. And when you finish all your boot, nothing is going to happen before you finish powering into all the bottles you brought. Brother, you have 1.5 million bottles. Nothing will happen until you filled it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, when you finish filling all your Elisha is not here, &gt;&gt; but I'm your Elisha. Now, I'm telling you, I'm instructing you what to do. Amen. Amen. Cuz I'm a servant of God, not because I'm Elisha. When you finished doing that, let us go back here. Now he says, "It came to pass the vessels were full that she said unto her son, bring me yet another vessel." You can pledge again, but you can't pledge again depending on somebody else because I'm not sure whether that will work. If you're really going to do a pledge, make it now, not later. Collect your vessels now. Not after you have seen that it works. Do it now by faith when you are in the situation you are in now. Hallelujah. And then begin powering in little by little. And after all the vessels are filled, that's when now the part of God is going to come into work. This woman has never maybe sold anything, not a business woman. She didn't know what to do. So, do you think that it was because of her salesmanship was able to sell that oil? It was a divine encounter. Now after you have finished your work, whatever you have been doing with your hands according to the word, God will begin to prosper it in levels that you, brother Enoch, has not seen before. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's up to you to take what I'm telling you, but I'm obeying the Holy Spirit. Sister Mary, &gt;&gt; I'm obeying the Holy Spirit in levels you've never not seen before, your business which was falling down. You will begin to see it reviving, reviving. And before you know it, you will pay all your creditors. Before you know it, you no longer struggle to get what to eat. Hallelujah. What I said up to now has been inspired. And as for our church and if I say anything after this, it would be my understanding of it. Let us stand on our feet. Fear the Lord all ye saints. He will give you everything. &gt;&gt; He will give you everything. If the sisters can come and help me sing it again. Amen. [Music] Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. If you can close your eyes and I want you to know that God answers prayer [Music] &gt;&gt; and is here with us. I did about the things you've heard. &gt;&gt; I saw the Lord and he answered me.
