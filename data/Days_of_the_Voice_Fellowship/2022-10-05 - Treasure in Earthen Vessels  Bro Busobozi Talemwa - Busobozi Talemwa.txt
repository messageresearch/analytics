dwelling in him sing the chorus one more time [Music] I believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] the game amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] do you love him tonight please stand with me to your Bibles in the book of second Corinthians [Music] we are reading chapter verse 4th was five to eleven foreign foreign this is a a big lengthy subject I've spoken on it before speaking on gideoni but today we're going to check another approach and maybe in the following Services we will see how the horses we begin with verse 5. but we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus is sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ but we have this treasure in Athen vessels that the Excellency of the power may be of God and not of us we are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body for we which leave are always delivered unto death for Jesus's sake and the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh foreign foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign foreign [Music] Ministry has quite a nice a nice Ministry and also Pasta Pasta is a teacher yeah so come come ready come with a pen come with a pepper I'm sure you will learn many new things for the first time [Music] I'm sure his ministry will also be a blessing to us but tonight you are stuck with mysterious and I'm going to speak to you on uh treasure in other universities foreign who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness has shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ [Music] so first of all we need to understand what is this treasure it is [Music] he is saying that this treasure has been placed in an Athen vessels you know when you it is a bit weird you have a treasure you don't really keep it in something as as fragile as a poor and [Music] a little journey to find out what this treasure is so before I spoke about the treasure in this treasure in other investors and it says for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness [Music] [Applause] don't just hear the scripture I wanted to think about it out of Darkness how could the light shine out of Darkness because you know in the book of in the Book of Genesis it says in the beginning Genesis 1 1 in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth foreign so and the alpha was without form and void and darkness was upon the first of the day and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and now listen to verse three if you can read it read it in your Bible and if you read that first person and God said now for God commanded katonda this is what he says in the book of Corinthians so God commanded the light to shine out of darkness in Genesis it says and God said right the same God who said let there be light um the one Paul is talking about in Corinthians for light to shine out of darkness and here in Genesis how they be commanded by simply saying let there be life was the light there is and there was like and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness so what is this treasure is the ability to command this treasure is the heaviness of the word of God [Music] is the word of God that is something out of nothing [Music] this is the treasure we're talking about and God said Hallelujah and this is a treasure for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness now he brings it from Genesis and he brings it down to us and he says he has shined in our hearts that same God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness not a second person not a fat person let there be light he that God has shined in our heart all you can turn yourself Hallelujah I mean who is that God everybody said Jesus Christ and in Hebrews 11 3 says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen we are not made out of things which do appear yeah we understand that the words were affirmed by the word of God we understand that that same God has shined in our hearts through faith we understand with the things which are seen are not made of the things which do appear together by faith that's why as a Christian foreign [Music] that's why a Christian is able to profess what the word cannot professions now this is an everlasting treasure somebody tell somebody that the treasure is the word of God hallelujah the word of God will never pass away and we are Christians because we have been preached to uh we have faith to believe to believe it's all about the world is that's what makes a difference because we believe the world regardless of the situation but afraid you believe the world regardless of what the word brings out to you believe the world and on the word of God something within you build because of the word of God the things I see and into the end that's made out of things you know you begin to believe things that will be considered that you are crazy others will begin to have their own explanations to be to explain things away they will tell you no there is a big banger Theory and then you will want to believe that something within your souls I believe that there was something this is the same thing that has created me that is the same thing that put me in the womb of my mouth that's the same thing that has been carrying me through my life's journey that is my pleasure yeah my words shall never never now you know Heaven and Earth is hmm but the uh gambo how did heaven and not come into existence meaningless things that the world that the world has created could pass away but the world remains are constant now my words will never pass away and the prophet says in a message on report now my words is the words of a man that's like my words are words [Music] if Christ is in you it is I mean Colossians 1 27 says to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory is other questions one is Colossians 1 27 cartoon channel who is Christ what is the revealed word of the house you have these riches [Music] what did he say in the beginning for God who commands the light to shine out of Darkness have shine in our hearts to give the light you can just say whatever to give the light of knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ to give the light of knowledge follow me here we're having a small Bible study tonight to give um the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ and then down here he says to whom to whom yo yo God would make known katonda what is the richest I would even say what is The Treasure of the glory of this mystery what is it Christ is Christ in me is the treasure foreign [Music] h don't just look at me I am preaching to you tonight and I'm here to inform you tonight that God Has Lifted you foreign you will always feel insufficient sometimes things happen and then you ask yourself whether you I believe or not when I waited 22 counties whether you can make it or not what is the purpose of tonight's services [Music] power that created heaven and Earth is from the goodness and this treasure is kept in an accident I mean it's not the Excellence of the power may be of God [Music] it is not with me with the power things are in our minds it's not treasure in me with the power not me keeping the holy ghosts in me keeping me it's not me struggling to make it is in Isaiah 46 it says the voice said cry and he said why what shall I try because and he said cry all flesh eat grass can you cry that too come and say it all flesh is grass oh my God all fish and maybe region now you may be the king you may be the president you may be rich you may be the pop one maybe already [Music] foreign um how many I've ever become sick become sick many times sometimes you get depressed sometimes you you are over excited when you see a flower whatever like this very Lively full of life there's another life coming down there oh he's just so happy you may think it will be there forever and so is our body and so is our life it's like a flowered feathers because the spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it is because the spirit of the Lord will always but the word of our God shall stand forever when I was reading this I said oh Hallelujah I am like a flower ninja [Music] [Music] [Applause] be a man who trusts in a man [Music] that is some people treasure gold people play the diamonds I was the truth of their wives another boyfriend girlfriend and how do we know what to treasure the Bible says that amen what what the money treasure is where the man's pleasure is where his heart is on your foreign foreign foreign our God is Wise from against our God it's great he doesn't keep his treasure in a bank with god with God hallelujah amen Our God doesn't put his treasures in a bunker somewhere but our God is great he came down from us Jesus Christ died in Christ and the Bible says foreign hallelujah amen you have something to tell the devil holidays amen you know to keep your treasure in a more seemingly secure and stronger vessels it is there was a man foreign do not touch it Hallelujah why why that is where the deepest of the treasure ments [Laughter] hey man she said you can touch everything about him but don't touch the secret place where I have kept my treasure don't go in the holy holies don't go in the secret okay with mine with my eyes [Applause] then you feel disconnect like brother sister already angle with them get into the message hallelujah amen some Believers when they're discouraged characters the Bible says that is where our treasure is of this economic crisis when you cannot run to the left or to the right foreign foreign oh yes blessed be the name of the Lord oh you can shout it by faith now [Music] [Music] the 360 stays behold I am according to thy wish in God's State I also am formed out of the clay foreign six to four eight says but now oh Lord Thou Art Our Father oh my brother I expect you to be there right it says we

be able to amount to anything God wants to mourn you be available for him while I am waiting you that I'm still gonna need [Music] and that's why he concludes that says number four oh [Music] if you
